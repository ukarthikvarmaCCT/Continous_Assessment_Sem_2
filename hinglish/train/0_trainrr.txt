 Virender Sehwag is identified as one of the most destructive cricketers of the 21st century
 viru balle ke saath jitna apratyaashit rahe, cricket ko hameshaa ke liye alavida kehane kaa unka style bhi bilkul vaisaa hi juda tha
 Last year, while everyone was talking about his birthday, Veeru announced his retirement
 aaj unke 38wein janmdin par viru ke sanyas ko ek saal puure ho chuke hai
 Let us recall some of the achievements of this most explosive and dangerous batsman on the cricket field which are still intact in the name of Sehwag
 1
 Sehwag, the only Indian to score a triple century, scored this record in 2004 against his arch-rival Pakistan on Pakistan soil
 unhone tab ke record vivies lakshmana ke 281 ranon ke score ko peeche chhodte hue 309 ran banaae
 This record is known to almost all fans of cricket
 lekin yah kam hi logon ko yaad hoga ki isi pari ke dauraan virendra sahvaag or sachin tendulkar ke bich tisare wicket ke liye 336 ranon kii saajhedaari hui thi jo aaj bhi is wicket ke liye bharat kii sabase badi saajhedaari kaa record he
 2
 chakke se tihara shatak jadne vaale pehle cricketervirendra sahvaag ne pakistan ke multan main apana pehla tihara shatak bade hi rochak andaaj main jadaa
 No cricketer had done this feat before him
 pehali baar koi bhartiya tihara shatak jadne ja rahaa tha
 Just four innings before this match, he was on the threshold of scoring his first double century on Australian soil but he tried to hit a six and was dismissed for 195 runs
 multan main yah baat sahvaag ke dimag main jarur rahi hogi, baavjood iske unhen out hone kaa koi bhay nahin tha
 It was Sehwag and it was his strong confidence that completed his marvelous feat with a six
 puraa hindustan unhen itihaas banaate tivi par dekh rahaa tha or is hairaan karan dene vaale pal ko apane seene main aaj bhi sahej kar rakhe hue hai
 Prior to Sehwag, no cricketer had completed a triple century with a six, while after that only one batsman, Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, did it in 2014
 3
 The feat of two triple centuries in Tests, on March 29, 2004, exactly four years after he scored a triple century in Multan, Sehwag did it again on March 28, 2008
 is baar dakshin africa team ko sahvaag kaa taap jhelana padaa
 Sehwag was the only third cricketer to perform after Sir Don Bradman and Brian Lara
 haalanki baad main kris gail bhi is list se jud gaye or ab tak keval chaar aise cricketer hai jinhone is uplabdhi ko do baar arjeet karne main kamyaabi paayi he
 Not only this, Sehwag was again on the threshold of scoring a triple century against Sri Lanka on 4 December 2009 but was dismissed for 293 runs and missed the feat by only seven runs
 gauratlab he ki sar don breadman bhi apane kariyar ke dauraan ek baar 299 par note out rahe the
 4
 shatak 100 se kam to dohare shatak 200 se kam gendon main!sahvaag ke naam 100 se kam gendon main sarvaadhik saat baar test shatak banane kaa record darj he
 Sehwag has scored a total of 23 centuries during his Test career
 unke baad adam gilcrist kaa number aata he jinhone yah karnama chah baar kiya
 Chris Gayle did it four times, Ian Botham, Kapil Dev, Brian Lara, Shahid Afridi and Brendon mccallum three times
 itnaa hi nahin ab tak test cricket main keval paanch dohare shatak aise bane hai jinhen banane main 200 se kam genden kheli gayi
 Three of them are on 168, 182 and 194 balls in the name of Sehwag alone
 do anya player nathan estal (153 gend) or brendan maikalam (186 gend) hai
 Sehwag scored six double centuries in Test cricket and five of them were in less than 230 balls
 yah sahvaag kaa ajooba he
 Why? It is known from this that no other batsman has a record of scoring two double centuries in less than 250 balls in Test cricket
 5
 Sachin Tendulkar did this feat when Virender Sehwag scored a double century in ODI cricket, but Sehwag did this feat under his own captaincy and he is the only cricket captain to score a double century in ODI cricket
 
 8 disambar 2011 ko indore ke holkar stadium (bharat ne abhi haal hi main yahaan apana 500waan test khelaa he) main sahvaag westeindies ke khilaaf bharat kii captaini kar rahe the
 Sehwag was in his own style on this day after winning the toss and came down to bat first
 unhone 25 chauke or saat chakke kii madad se keval 149 gendon main 219 ran bana die
 With this, he demolished Sanath Jayasuriya's record of greatest captaincy innings in ODI cricket
 itnaa hi nahin yah lagbhag teen saalon tak vanade kaa sarvaadhik vyaktigat score bhi rahaa
 Which Indian Rohit Sharma broke against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens on 13 November 2014 and scored 264 runs
 6
 Sehwag's unique record in Test and ODI cricket is such a unique record that it has not been easy for the biggest cricketer to get
 ek samay cricket ke teenon hi formet main bhartiya team kii sabase badi pari main sabase bada vyaktigat yogadan dene cricketer virendra sahvaag hi the
 India's highest score in the Test was 729 / 9 (against Sri Lanka in 2009)
 sahvaag ne is pari main 293 ran banaae
 418 / 5 in odis (against West Indies in 2011) is India's highest score and Sehwag's contribution in this match was 219 runs
 ye donon record to aaj bhi barkaraar hai
 But his record in the T20 is now demolished which he made during the 2007 World T20 against England in Durban
 us match main bharat ne 218 / 4 kaa score khadaa kiya tha or isamen sarvaadhik 68 ranon kaa yogadan sahvaag ne diya tha

 NTAGI discussed this in a meeting on 19 December on the recommendations of the Sub Committee to implement HPV
 haalanki meeting main is par koi faisla nahin ho paaya
 As soon as the news about the recommendations of the sub-committee became public, Swadeshi Jagran Manch, the economic wing of the Union, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister about this and informed about the security and cost concerns

 The letter said, 'swadeshi Jagran Manch recommends you not to apply HPV vaccine in India

 shukla ne phone par kaha, ‘master blaster sachin tendulkar abhi cricket khel rahe hai
 Right now they are playing Ranji matches and after that they will play in international matches also, hence the news of publicity in support of Congress candidates in their assembly elections is completely meaningless

 shinganapur main shani chabutare par chadhane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi mahilaon ko aaj adaalat kaa bhi saath mil gaya
 On hearing an application, the Bombay High Court has sought a written reply from the state government within two days and asked that if men can go to the platform of Shani temple then why not women? saamaajik kaaryakarta vidya bal ke mutabik rajya hindu dharmik sthalon main pravesh ke adhikaar kaa kanoon 1956 se astitv main he
 Even after this, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Shankaracharya and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis are spending time in the name of discussion
 isliye majaboor hokar unhen adaalat se guhaar lagaani padi
 The Shani temple platform at Shinganapur prohibits women from leaving
 pichley saal november main ek mahila ne chabutare par chadhakar saalon se chali aa rahi us parampara ko todane kaa saahas dikhaaya
 After that the women of Ranragini brigade also tried unsuccessfully to enter the temple
 tippaniyan Now on this question of the court, ncp's Vidya Chavan has expressed happiness that it has given strength to women
 jabaki shivasena kii neelam gorhe kaa kahana he mahilaon ko unka adhikaar dilaane kii jimmedaari sarkaar kii he or use apni jimmedaari nibhaani chahie
 After Shani Shingnapur, voices have started to be raised against such discrimination in other temples and dargahs in the state
 ab sab kii nigahen rajya sarkaar ke jawaab par lagi he
 According to social activist Vidya Bal, the state right of entry into Hindu religious places has been in existence since 1956
 iske baad bhi shri shri ravishankar, shankaracharya or mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis charchaa ke naam par vakt jaaya kar rahe hai
 So they were forced to appeal to the court

 While Neelam Gorhe of Shiv Sena says that it is the responsibility of the government to give women their rights and they should fulfill their responsibility
 shani shinganapur ke baad rajya ke duusare mandiron or dargah main bhi is tarah ke bhedbhaav ke khilaaf aawaaj uthni shuru ho gai he
 Now everyone's eyes are on the state government's response

 There is a flood of books written on them

 But Dr
 Makhanlal Chaturvedi, Assistant Professor of National Journalism and Communication University, Dr
 saurabh malviya kii kitaab 'vikaas ke path par bharat' isse thodi alag he
 Although looking at the picture of Prime Minister Modi with the Parliament House on the cover of the book, it seems that this book is also going to promote him, but after its chapter and page reversal, this recognition seems to change, and it becomes clear This book is based on informative, explanatory details and facts of government schemes and not on praise
 saurabh malviya ne gahan adhyayan ke baad is kitaab ke madhyam se centre va rajya sarkaron kii 36 pramukh yojanaon ko samajhane kii pahal kii he
 Saurabh Malaviya has also written in the preface of this book that 'the government is running many schemes for the social, economic and educational development of the people of the country
 har yojana kaa uddeshy hota he ki uskaa laabh har vyakti tak pahunche
 When the benefit of the scheme reaches the individual, that plan succeeds
 is samay desh main lagbhag dedh sau yojanaayen chal rahi hai
 Most of these are old plans
 inamen kai aisi puraani yojanaayen bhi hai, jinke naam badal die gaye hai
 There are many such schemes, which were almost closed and have been restarted
 inamen kuch nai yojanaayen bhi sammilit hai
 There are two types of government schemes in the country
 pehali yojanaayen ve hai, jo centre sarkaar dwaara chalaai jaati hai
 Such schemes are run in the entire country or some specific states of the country
 duusari yojanaayen ve hai, jo rajya sarkarein chalaati hai
 Through this book, an attempt has been made to bring some important schemes of the government to the readers
 akasar aisa hota he ki agyanta or ashiksha ke kaaran logon ko sarkaar kii jan hitaishi yojanaon kii jaankaree nahin hoti, jiske kaaran ve in yojanaon kaa laabh uthaane se vanchit rah jate hai
 The purpose of this book is that people should take advantage of all the schemes that the government is running for their welfare
 
 Information on these schemes is based on the information received from the concerned ministries
 ullekhneey he ki samay-samay par yojanaon main aanshik rup se parivartan bhi hota rahata he
 Publisher Yash Publications has also spoken
 prakaashak ne likhaa he ki desh kii centre sarkaar or rajya sarkarein janata ke kalyaan ke liye anek yojanaayen chalaa rahi hai
 The main objective of these schemes is to improve the standard of living of the people and ensure equal development of all areas
 sarkaar dwaara vibhinn kalyankari yojanaon ko lakshith samoohon kii sthiti ke anuroop taiyaar kiya jaataa he, taaki lakshith varg in se labhanvit ho sake
 The government is paying special attention to women's empowerment and various schemes are being run for it
 sarkaar dwaara beti bachaao beti padhaao, pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana, jan dhan yojana, pradhanmantri jivan jyoti yojana, digital india tathaa svachh bharat mishan aadi mahatvakankshi yojanaayen chalaai ja rahi hai
 This book throws light on some such schemes of the Central and State Governments
 is pustak ke madhyam se sarkaar kii janhitaishi yojanaon kii jaankaree jan-jan tak pahunchane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 This book will surely achieve success in its purpose
 kitaab kii bhoomika main varisht patrkaar shishir sinha ne likhaa he ki vikaas ke aankadon main aam aadmi hameshaa hi ek sawaal kaa jawaab dhoondhata he
 The question is, what do these figures mean for 'me'? The question then becomes even more important that two headlines of a newspaper tell a different story on the same day
 pehali surkhi he, 'bharat duniya main sabase teji se vikaas karne vaala desh bana' yaa phir 'bharat agle do varshon tak sabase teji se vikaas karne vaala bana rahegaa desh,' vahiin duusari surkhi he 'arbapatiyon kii sampatti rojaanaa ausatan 2200 karod rupye badi, baari garibi main ji rahi 10 fisadi aabaadi lagaataar 14 saalon se karj main he dubi
 'in such a situation, the question becomes even more important that 7
 3, 7
 5 or 7
 7 fisadi kii salanaa vikaas dar ke myne aabaadi ke ek bahut hi chote hisse tak simit he, yaa phir inkaa phayda samaaj main aakhri paaydaan ke vyakti ko bhi mil paa rahaa he yaa nahin?aise hi sawaalon kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye ye jaruri ho jaataa he ki vikaas ko surkhi se aage jan-jan tak pahunchane ke liye aakhirkaar sarkaar ne kiya kya, yaa phir jo kiya wo pehle se kis tarah se alag tha?
 
 
 
 is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane kii koshish yah kitaab karti he
 
 
 In his role, he has further written that the truth is that the importance of any government scheme depends on how soon it is able to make its way in the thinking of the common man from the government's thinking
 saath hi jaruri ye bhi he ki sarkari yojanaon ko mahaj paisa baantne kaa ek madhyam nahin mana jaae, balki ye dekhnaa bhi jaruri hoga ki wo kis tarah vyakti se lekar samaaj, rajya or phir desh kii behatari me yogadan kar sake
 It would also be better that the process of sharing anything for free should stop
 kya aisa sab kuch pichley saadhe chaar saal ke dauraan shuru kii gayi yojanaon main dekhne ko mila he, iskaa jawaab kaaphi had tak haa main hoga
 one more thing
 rajyon ke bich bhi nae prayogon ke saath yojanaayen shuru karne kii pratispardhaa chal rahi he or sukhad nishkarsh ye he ki chaahe wo kisi bhi raajnneetik dal kii sarkaar ne shuru kii ho, uski upyogita ko duusari raajnneetik dalon kii sarkaron ne pahachaanaa
 Take the Raitu Bandhu scheme of Telangana and the Kalia scheme of Odisha
 kisaanon kii jindagi badalane kii in yojanaon kaa centre sarkaar adhyayan kar rahi he, taaki rashtriya str kii yojana main in yojanaon kii kuch khaas baton ko shaamil kiya ja sake
 The goal of starting various government schemes is that everyone should get the benefit of development i
e
 development is inclusive
 kuch aise hi paimaanon ke aadhaar par yahaan ullekith 36 yojanaon kaa aankalan kiya janaa chahie
 Then the question can be raised whether these schemes are successful? If the government says it should be successful, then you should not hesitate to discuss in front of the new report on inequality
 ek baat to tay he koi kitna bhi dharm-jati-sampradaay ko aadhaar banaakar raajnneeti kar le lekin matadaata iviem par batan dabaane ke pehle ek baar zarur sochataa he ki amuk ummidavaar ne vikaas ke liye kya kuch kiya he, yaa phir kya wo aage vikaas ke bare main kuch thos kar sakegaa
 Do not forget that government schemes run with your own money and you get an opportunity every five years to present your views on the significance of these schemes
 aisi soch viksit karne ke liye jaruri he ki aapke samaksh sarkari yojanaon kaa byora saral or sahaj tareeke se pesh kiya jaae
 The book 'india on the Path of Development' will help in this work

 unhone kaha ki jo log mujhe bhaaga hua bataa rahe hai, aise ‘maansik vikruti vaale logon ke anargal bayanon kaa mujhe koi jawaab nahin dena
 "he was neither underground nor in police custody," he said

 unhone ramdev ke andolan main bhaajapa or sangh parivaar ke shaamil hone ke aaropon par kaha ki aarope lagane vaale aisa andolan ko sampradayik rang dene ke liye kar rahe hai
 Balakrishna cried and said that seeing the condition of the injured people, he cried a lot at that time and decided that those who have come from so far away on one voice of Baba Ramdev, will not leave them in this condition
 unhone kaha ki maine kisi tarah se logon se sampark kar dawaaon kii vyavastha kii or logon ko yahaan bhijwane kii vyavastha kii
 Balakrishna said that many people are still missing and the list of registrations of people joining the satyagraha will be examined and ascertained

 ) Dushyant Chautalam, who emerged as the kingmaker in Haryana, broke away from the Aditya Thakredushyant family in the race to become king of Maharashtra, Aditya broke the tradition
 The assembly elections in two states have given birth to two new leaders
 ek viraasat kii siyasat ko aage badhaane ke liye apni pari kaa aagaaj kar chuke hai, to duusare ne parivaar se baghawat kar apana alag raajnneetik rasta taiyaar kar liya he
 These two princesses of politics are Aditya Thackeray and Dushyant Chautala
 dushyant chautaala jahaan haryana main kingmekar kii bhoomika main aa gaye hai, vahiin aditya thakare ko shivasena maharashtra kaa king banane kii jugat main he
 The results of the assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana have been announced on Thursday
 haryana main kisi bhi dal ko bahumat nahin mila he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party, which emerged as the biggest party, has got 40 seats and the Congress has been reduced to 31
 yani in donon pramukh dalon main se koi bhi sarkaar banane ke liye apane dam par siten hasil nahin kar paaya he
 In such a situation, the role of Jananayak Janata Party (JJP), which won 10 seats, has become the most important and its leader Dushyant Chautala has become the role of kingmaker
 haryana main atka bahumat: kahaan kamjor pade khatter, baari pade ye factorpariwaar se baghawat kar banaaya apana rastachoudhary devilal kii siyaasi viraasat ko lekar purv mukhyamantri omprakash chautaala ke beton main jang chhid gai to indian neshnal lokdal (INLD) kii kaman chote bete abhaya chautaala ke haath main aa gai
 In December 2018, Dushyant parted ways with the Chautala family, and formed his own party Jananayak Janata Party
 nai naveli party ke dam par dushyant puure haryana main ghume or rajya kii sabhi 90 siton par apni party ke pratyaashee utaare
 Dushyant got public support and JJP won 10 seats
 jabaki duusari taraf INLD bas ek seat hi jeet pai
 That is, Dushyant has gone his separate political journey after rebelling after not getting the political legacy of the family
 king banane kii res main aditya thakare?ek taraf dushyant chautaala hai to is chunaav main ek or sabase charchit yuva cheharaa aditya thakare hai
 If Dushyant revolted from the family and went out on a different path, then Aditya changed the tradition of Thackeray family by contesting elections
 shivasena ke 53 saal ke itihaas main na party ke sansthaapak bala sahib thakare ne kabhi chunaav ladaa or unke vaaris uddhav thakare
 But when the opportunity came to Aditya to take up family politics, he forgot the past and went to the polls
 aditya varli seat se chunaav jeet bhi gaye hai or ab charchaa unke mukhyamantri yaa upmukhyamantri banane ko lekar he
 Pawar's charisma, not power: bjp's backfire on NCP Chief Rukh Shiv Sena's Uddhav Thackeray and his party's attitude has been different ever since the kind of results that have come for the BJP and Shiv Sena in Theri Akhand Maharashtra
 shivasena puri shiddat se is baat ko aage rakh rahi he ki sarkaar banane kii sthiti main purvanirdhaarit 50-50 formule par amal karnaa jaruri hoga, jiske tahat sarkaar main baraabar kii bhagidaari par sahmati bani thi
 On this basis, Shiv Sena's eye is also being pointed out on the Chief Minister's chair
 khud uddhav thakare ne chunaav nateezon ke baad kaha ki yah ek ahm masalaa par jis par charchaa hogi
 At the same time, he has been saying before the results that one day Shiv Sena CM will definitely happen, he promised to Balasaheb Thackeray
 aise main shivasena is maukey jarur bhunaanaa chaahegi or agar aise sameekaran banate hai to nishchit hi aditya thakare kisi badi bhoomika main najar aa sakate hai
 In this way, the assembly elections of Maharashtra and Haryana have given two new and young leaders in these two states, whose future looks bright in the current circumstances
 purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli ne kaha ki maujuuda australian team bharat kaa daura karne vaali ab tak kii sabase kamjor team he
 Ganguly said, "they don't have batsmen to play spinners, there are no wicket-spinners here
 main team kaa akalan nahin karnaa chahta lekin 1996 ke baad australia ko dekhte hue mujhe lagata he ki bhartiya sarajameen par khilne vaali yah sabase kamjor team he
 Reacting to the hat-trick of India's win against Australia, Ganguly said that India needed four more days of spin-friendly pitch at Kotla to be whitewashed 4–0 in this series
 australian team prabandhan kaa chaar khilaadiyon ko anushaasahinata ke kaaran nilambit karne ke faisla ganguli ko pasand nahin aayaa
 He said, 'no matter how disciplined you are, but to be successful, skill is required
 is daure par australian team main kaushal kii kami he
 ' uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party(sapa) or bahujan samaaj party(basapa) kaa gathbandhan plan final ho gaya he
 Tomorrow, Saturday, at 12 noon, SP President Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati can make a formal announcement at the press conference
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki donon partiyon main gathbandhan pakkaa he or isamen congress shaamil nahin he
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Uttar Pradesh will now have BJP on one side and Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati on the other side
 kabhi chhattis kaa aankada rakhane vaali samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party puraani ranjish bhuulane ko taiyaar ho gayi hai
 Both did not consider Congress worthy of being a partner in this journey
 congress se parade ke peeche ranneetik talmail ho saktaa he
 It will be a matter of what his appearance will be
 aise main ham aapke bataate hai kaise sapa-basapa ne congress ko jor kaa jhatka diya he
 Which are the reasons why both parties have come together
 1-2017 vidhansabha chunaav main kam siton kaa milanoutar pradesh main 2017 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main sapa-or basapa donon ko badi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 While SP had won 47 seats in this election, the BSP had to settle for 19 seats
 bijepi ko is chunaav main 312 seat mili thim
 In such a situation, both parties had to come together to face Modi in 2019
 2-2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ke saamne post hona2014 main modi lahar main donon partiyon kii badi haar hui thi
 In Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 seats, the BSP did not get a single seat and the SP was left only to its clan
 2014 ke baad se jis tarah se donon partiyaan kaa graph gira uske baad se donon ko ek bade sahare kii jarurat thi
 In such a situation, both the parties came together to forget 26 years of enmity and prepared to face Modi in 2019
 3-upachunaav main donon dalon ke saath kaa formula hit hua tha
 The formula for the two was a hit in the Phulpur and Gorakhpur by-elections
 bijepi kii sabase surakshit seat maane jane vaali gorakhpur main donon ne saath ladaa or jeet hasil kii
 4-left due to weak condition of Congress
 uttar pradesh main congress kii haalat lagataar kamjor hoti gai
 Where Congress needed support to stand once again in the state, both of them did not give it a place in the coalition
 vidhansabha chunaav main sapa congress ke saath milakar ladi thi or yah gathbandhan flop sabit hua tha
 In this election, SP 47 and Congress managed to win only 7 seats
 5-gathbandhan naa hone kii surat main donon kaa bhavishya khatre main
 If the SP and BSP were not aligned, then this time the bjp's path would have become easier in the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi kii jeet ke saath hi donon partiyaan kaa bhavishya bhi khatre main ho jaataa
 a severe defeat in the first assembly elections and defeat in two consecutive Lok Sabha elections would threaten the future of both these major parties of UP
 6-loksabhaa main sabase zyada upi se 80 siton kaa sawaal he
 Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of Lok Sabha seats
 har party yahaan par zyada se zyada seat jeetne par dhyaan detii he
 This state has also given the maximum Prime Minister to the country
 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ne is rajya main aitihaasik pradarshan karte hue 71 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 The influence of SP and BSP is most in this state
 aise main donon partiyaan 2019 chunaav main zyada se zyada seat jeetne kii ummid rakhi hai
 The Congress and Samajwadi Party contested the 2017 UP assembly elections
 is chunaav main bijepi ko 312 seat, espi ko 47 seat, bispi ko 19 seat or congress ko 7 mili thim
 In the last few days, the way Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been seen as an attacker on the Modi government and his popularity has increased compared to the way the Congress has increased
 congress isi ummid main he ki party upi main is baar acha pradarshan karegi
 Rahul Gandhi himself has said that Congress can do well in UP
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa vichaar upi main kaaphi majboot he
 So we have full confidence in our capacity in UP and we will surprise people
 congress gathbandhan se dur jarur he lekin isse bijepi kaa sirdard kam nahin hone vaala
 The Congress still has 6 to 8 percent of the vote in UP
 savarnon ko thok ke bhav tikat dekar congress bijepi ke vot bank main send to laga hi degi

 Tanushree Dutta has accused Nana Patekar of molesting her during the shooting of the film 'horn Ok Please' 10 years ago
 iske saath hi bollywood main Metoo kaa mudda ek baar phir garma gaya
 Tanushree has said that Nana wanted to be intimate during an item song, but she was not ready for it
 ve naaraaz hokar apni venity vine main chali gayi
 Tanushree has spoken about her flirting with the film (life OK Please), her assistant director Shayeni Shetty has told in a conversation with Indian Express what she saw on the set
 shayani duusari ai vitaness hai
 Journalist Janice Cicaria has previously claimed to be an eye witness of the case
 bollywood main metoo: koun tanushri ke saath, kisne diya golmol javabshayani ne kaha, "film kii shooting main reharsal ke dauraan naanaa ke saath kaam karne main tanushri asahaj ho rahi thim
 It was an item song, which we were shooting at Filmistan Studio
 thodaa sa kaam bachaa tha
 We did not shoot for the first two days, as we were rehearsing
 vaise jab gaanaa shoot hota he to edi kaa kaam zyada nahin rahata, kyonki koreographer sab kuch dekhtaa he, ham set par the or reharsal dekh rahe the
 At one point of time we could clearly see that Tanushree was uncomfortable at a particular step or that she had problems with the way rehearsals were being done
 jab yah sab hua, tab main thodi duuri par baithi thi, isliye nahin bataa sakati ki asal main kya baatcheet ho rahi thim
 But i can say that Tanushree was really uncomfortable
 iske baad ve venity vine main chali gayi
 This nonsense started on the set that the heroine was not co-operating
 is dauraan avyavashtha fail gai, log venity vine ke andar baahar aa-ja rahe the
 i am not sure whether Nana went to Tanushree's vanity van or not
 lekin set par baatcheet ho rahi thi or yah badbadaya ja rahaa tha ki kuch nahin hua
 Nothing is happening vah co-operate nahin kar rahi
 Then Tanushree came out and followed the set
 hamane sochaa ki shooting waapas shuru hogi
 # metoo in Bollywood: Tanushree's allegations on Vivek after Nana had said- 'utro clothes', after which she started screaming on the set and locked herself in a vanity van
 set par ye baatcheet shuru ho gai ki kuch galat ho rahaa he
 My director Rakesh Sarang and the rest were talking in Marathi
 ve log unhen shant karne kii koshish main lage the
 We understood that Tanushree is angry
 iske baad tanushri apni car main chali gai, jahaan logon ke ek samooh ne unki car main todphod shuru kar di
 Somehow Tanushree defended herself
 is sabake baad gane ke liye raakhi saavant ko tanushri se riples kar diya gaya
 What did the journalist on the set say? Journalist Janice Cicaria was also present during the shooting of the film
 unhone bhi us din kaa puraa vakya share kiya he
 He has told the story in several tweets
 unhone likhaa, "ek dashak pehle hui ghatnaayen bhi kai baar aapke jehan main taaja rahati hai
 An incident that happened during the shooting of the film 'ok' Please is also similar
 " jainis ne likhaa, "main us vakt vahaan thi naanaa patekar
 i was told that the shooting has been stopped because of the actress
 tanushri ko sanbhaalanaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 i could clearly see that Tanushree was very upset by anything
 "tanushri-naanaa vivaad: bollywood chup, patrkaar kaa daawa- sach bol rahi hai actress, set par thi manjainis ne likhaa ki vah saaf taur par dekh paa rahi thim ki naanaa patekar, koreographer ganesh acharya or ek shaks (jo unhen baad main pataa chalaa ki film kaa produsar he) vahaan khadey kisi bare main charchaa kar rahe the or kareeb 50 dancers set par khadey intjaar kar rahe the
 Official information was that Heroine is not cooperating
 kuch der baad shooting shuru kar di gai
 Janis wrote in her tweet - "tanushree resumed her job and after a few shots Nana rejoined her
 lekin naanaa ke aate hi tanushri set se chali gayi
 Shooting was again halted
 unhone khud ko venity vine main band kar liya
 She refused to come out
 dekhte-dekhte vahaan kuch mushtande ikatthe ho gaye or unhone daravaaje ko dhakiyana shuru kar diya
 "an attack on Tanushree's parents? On getting information, it was found out that the producers had called these people
 is bich police ai
 Amidst all this, Janice gets a chance to talk to Nana and Nana just says, "my daughter is like that
" " is baat kaa us maukey par koi matlab nahin tha
 Jainis told that in the meantime Tanushree's parents came there and their car was attacked
 gaadi kii wind shield tod di gai
 Tanushree Dutta was crying? Later, when Janis got a chance to meet Tanushree, she narrated the whole story to her
 jainis ke mutabik tanushri ne unhen bataaya ki 3 din kii practice ke baad koreographer ganesh acharya ne dance shoot kaa har ek step badal diya tha
 All this was done because the producers wanted Nana to dance with Dutta
 kya he puraa maamla?tanushri ne naanaa patekar par shooting ke dauraan budtamiji or chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He accused Nana of trying to force himself with him during the shooting of a film in 2008
 unhone kaha tha, ''naanaa patekar jabaran kareeb aana chaahate the, ve shooting ke dauraan gane kaa hissaa nahin the, baavjood unhone unke saath intimet hone kii koshish kii
 Tanushree wanted to shave her hair, then took the path of spiritualism, choreographer Ganesh Acharya, director Rakesh Sarang and producer Sami Siddiqui are all aware of this, but nobody did anything
 '' tanushri ne kaha tha naanaa heroinon ko peetate the
 Everyone in the industry knows that he has always been like this about heroines
 is maamle main ganesh acharya kaa riection saamne aa chukaa he
 Ganesh has given a clean chit to Nana
 jiske baad tanushri ne ganesh ko jhootha or dogala kaha
 What did Nana say on Tanushree's allegations? Nana Patekar's reaction has also come to light on the serious allegations against him
 unhone aaropon se inkaar karte hue kaha, "unka sexual herracement se kya matlab he? vahaan par 50 se 100 log set par mere saath the
 i see what i can do legally

 kai deshon main alag-alag din is din ko manaaya jaataa he
 Mother's Day is celebrated on 8 March in many countries as International Women's Day
 international madard de vaise to 8 march ko manaaya jaataa he
 Today we talk about the relationship of mother and daughter
 maa or beti kaa rishta is duniya ke sabase khubasurat rishton main se ek he
 It is said that not every daughter is a shadow of her mother
 
 
 lekin phir is parchaai ko maa kii kai baaten katai pasand nahin hoti
 Even though from the experiences in the life to come, he would learn that mother used to say right
 
 
 'kyonki maa bhi kabhi beti thi
 
 ' phir bhi vah ye samajhe bina ki kuch baaten beti ko sunanaa pasand nahin, baar-baar unhen doharaati he
 So now, without prolonging the talk, tell you five things that every mother must say to her daughter and every daughter does not want to listen to them

 ek farvari 2018 bharat ke liye ek khaas taarikh thi
 Not because the budget came that day
 vah to har saal aata he
 It was the day to unify the vast interstate business in India
 is taarikh ko dwarka se dimapur or leh se kowalam tak kaarobaari saamaan kii awajahi sabhi kism ke avarodhon se mukt hone vaali thi
 GST e they hold the bill? Right
 yah jiesti kaa sabase jaruri or doorgaami hissaa tha
 This was the beginning of One Nation, One System
 bas computer se niklaa ek bill or kahin bhi maal le jane kii chhot, na koi permit, na checkpost! yahi vajah thi ki bajet ke din kaarobaariyon kii dilchaspee vitt mantri ke bhaashan main nahin balki i ve bill main thi
 On 1 February, the budget speech and the struggle to get e-bill from GST network started simultaneously
 bajet bhaashan khatm hone tak jiesti kaa network baith chukaa tha
 Some states have announced to cancel the implementation
 shaam hote-hote tivi studio main jab bajet gunj rahaa tha, usee dauraan jiesti ke afasar ek twit tikaakar ghar ko nikal liye ki takneekee dikkaton ke kaaran i ve bill kaa kriyanvayan anischitkaal ke liye taala ja rahaa he
 And thus, the biggest objective of GST i
e
 making the country a market was also the farm
 shuruyaat ke saat maheene bitate-bitate, jiesti sudhaar se chunauti main tabdeel ho gaya he
 The tax hit (capital gains, increase in customs, cess and surcharge) in this budget is the result of GST
 network kii naakaami se ritern or tex sangrah kaa bura haal pehle se tha
 Meanwhile, in the grip of Gujarat elections, the structure of GST was torn
 95 fisadi karadaataaon ko ritern bharne se riyaayat mili
 As a result, expectations of increasing revenue from GST have collapsed in the last seven months
 -rajyon ko or zyada nuksaan hua
 60,000 crore to the states from the Union Budget for the previous July to March
 kii bharpai hogi or agle saal 90,000 karod ru
 Will be given rajasav main kami or kshatipurti ne vitt mantri kaa ghaataa niyantran record daagdar kar diya
 - The objective of making all businessmen taxpayers has been derailed
 jiestn kii khami, 95 fisadi karadaataaon ko timahi ritern kii suvidha or ek fisadi tex va timahi ritern vaali compojishan skim ke kaaran keval 30 fisadi karadaata vistrut invais ritern bhar rahe hai
 Much larger business is out of tax monitoring due to GST failure
 -jiesti main panjikaran ke shuruaati aankade sarkaar ke liye utsahvardhak hai
 The number of taxpayers has increased by 50 percent
 chote udyogon main ek-tihaai len-dein kaarobaari ikaayiyon ke bich ho rahaa he
 This makes it easier to follow the tax rules
 har rajya ko uske audyogic kaarobaari paridrishy ke hisaab se panjikaran mili hai
 This has ended the possibility of loss or benefit to a particular state
 -alabatta in upyogi soochnaaon ke jariye rajasav badaae kii ummid kam he kyonki jiesti kaa kriyanvayan patari se utar chukaa he
 Monitoring of movement of goods across the country through e-bill was necessary to prevent tax evasion
 saat-aath lakh bill prati din jari karne vaala system banane ke liye enisi (sarkari computer agency) ko lagaaya gaya lekin yah koshish bhi asafal rahi
 In his interviews after the budget, the Finance Minister said that GST revenue will increase with strict compliance with tax rules
 vitt mantralay kaa kahana he ki nigaraanee badhaakar ek lakh karod ru
 Tax can be charged
 sarkaar ko jaankaree he ki is sudhaar main riyaayaton kaa kota puraa ho gaya he
 Tax evasion is happening because of the facilities and technical flaws given due to electoral fears
 rajasav main giravat ke kaaran jiesti main agle sudhaar (petro utpaada, achal sampatti ko shaamil karnaa) jahaan ke tahaan thahar gaye hai
 The government's political dilemma regarding GST is much bigger
 ise patari par laane ke liye inspector raaj kii vaapasi yani chote vyapaariyon par sakhti kerani hogi
 The burning government of Gujarat was taking this risk during the election year
 isliye sidhe or aasaani se ugaahe jane vaale tex (inakam tex, ses or seemaa shulk) badha liye gaye hai, upabhokta to tex chukaa hi rahe hai, kaarobaari tex denge yaa nahin, iskaa hisaab chunaav dekhakar hoga
 The one who was afraid has happened
 bharat kaa sabase nayaa sudhaar sirf saat maah main puraane radio kii tarah ho gaya, jise thok-peet kar kisi tarah chalaaya ja rahaa he
 The reformism of GST will always be safe in our memories

 The people of this troubled border province, divided into religious, political and ideological divides, are once again preparing themselves to try their collective bets on their fate
 mufti mohammad said ne 12 maheene pehle bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke saath asambhav-sa gathjod karne main kamyaabi hasil kii thi, jise kuch logon ne 'aswabhaavik' bataaya tha, kuch ne 'do paraspar virdohi dhruvon kaa ek asthir gathbandhan' kaha tha or kuch ne ise 'uttar or dakshin ke mail' kaa naam diya tha
 Today, his 56-year-old daughter and flamboyant head of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Mehbooba Mufti is going to take over as chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir
 rajya ke lambey sankatagrast itihaas main aisa pehali baar hoga ki koi mahila mukhyamantri banegi
 Apparently, this achievement came after a major personal tragedy for him
 pichhali 7 janvari ko unke pita kaa dehanth ho gaya tha
 Now they have a long list of challenges
 garmiyon main srinagar ke ferevyuu cottage or sardiyon main jammu kii vazaarat road par sthit bhavy mukhyamantri awaas main baithkar mahabuuba ko ek khatarnaak santulan saadhane kaa kaam karnaa hoga
 This balance has to be established between Srinagar and Delhi, between the beautiful Kashmir Valley and Jammu, and between the long-standing Muslim-dominated PDP and the Hindu nationalist BJP, which has slowly paved the way in the valley, at the dose of 'soft separatism'
 She is making
 kya mahabuuba iske liye taiyaar hai? mufti mohammad said ke intikaal ke baad unhone lambey vakt tak shok main siyaasi ghatnakram se duuri banaae rakhi or (kai logon ke mutabik) jaan-boojhkar deree kii or 11 hafton tak mukhyamantri banane kii koi jaldi nahin dikhaai
 He tried to reassure the BJP leadership on a time bound agenda of alliances
 yah agenda 16 panne kaa ek dastavej he jise 1 march, 2015 ko donon partiyon ne apanaaya tha, jab unke bich pehali baar milijuli sarkaar banane kaa faisla hua tha
 Mehbooba is well aware that during the first eight months under his father, almost nothing has been done to launch the agenda at the ground level
 isaki badi vajah yah thi ki narendra modi kii sarkaar nirnaayak kshetron main mufti ko samarthan dene main hichkicha rahi thi, jisamen 2014 ke hajaaron baadh peedit logon ko raahat muhaiyaa karaane kaa kaam bhi shaamil tha
 Then, there were frequent disputes that could have been avoided
 masalan, jail se ek algaavvaadi kii rihaai, bif par pratibandh or jammu-kashmir ke samvidhan main prastaavit rajya ke jhande ke prayog par matbhed
 PDP insiders say that for 11 consecutive weeks when Mehbooba had confounded her party leaders with deep confusion due to her silence, she was actually considering the discretion of continuing the alliance with the BJP 
 '' bhavishya kii disha kaa pataa tab laga jab 19 march ko tamaam matbhedon ko sulajhane ke liye bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah or mahasachiv ram madhav se dilli main kii gai mulaakaat ke baad pradhanmantri se mulaakaat kaa intjaar karne kii bajaae ve srinagar laut gayi
 Two days later, it seemed that everything was cured with a spell

 The Congress has raised questions on Gurumurthy's statement of the demise of the 2000 note and said that the statement made by Gurumurthy raises a question as to who is running the government
 congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad kaa kahana he kii gurumurti ne jo 2000 ke note band hone kii baat kahi he, isliye sawaal uthta he ki kya gurumurti sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 The government is running Gurumurthy or is running the Prime Minister or is running the Finance Minister or the Reserve Bank of India
 gulam nabi aaazaad bole ki jab pehle note bandi kaa faisla kiya gaya tha us vakt bhi pradhanmantri ne isaki ghoshnaa kii thi jabaki isaki ghoshnaa rigerv bank of india ke dwaara yaa vitt mantri ke dwaara kii jaani chahie thi
 Naidu overturned: On behalf of the government, Information and Broadcasting Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that Gurumurthy has only suggested that anyone has the right to suggest, Gurumurthy is a nationalist
 gulam nabi aaazaad ke bayaan par venkaiya naidu kaa kahana he ki unke samay main sarkaar sonia gandhi chalaati thi isliye vah aisi baaten kar rahe kar rahe hai
 At this time in our government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi only decides if the Congress has to give any suggestion, then it should come in Parliament
 vainkaya naidu kaa kahana he kipradhanmantri narendra modine jo faisla kiya he janata unke saath he isse kalaadhan bhrashtachar khatm hoga

 In Delhi's largest hospital AIIMS, hundreds of people go daily to get their treatment from Bihar and to reduce this problem, in the government of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the practice of opening AIIMS on the lines of Delhi was started in many cities
 
 patna bhi khushnaseeb tha or usase bhi ames kii saugat mil gai
 The work at AIIMS in Patna finally started in 2012 after a delay of 7 years
 kuch din pehle kendriya swasthya rajya mantri ashvini choube ne bhi patna ames ko lekar kaha tha ki vah chaahate hai ki patna ames kii swasthya sevaayen itani behtareen kar di jaaen taaki bihar ke logon ko apana ilaaj karaane ke liye dilli naa janaa pade
 In such a situation, the question arises that even after 5 years, the health services in Patna AIIMS have become so much better that the people of Bihar do not have to go to Delhi AIIMS
 This institute was able to get treatment for every disease
 dilli ames ke tarj par bana ye santhaan aaj bhi buniyadi suvidhaon ke bagaiyr hi karyrat he
 If we talk about the hospital, the most important thing here is emergency services, but even after 5 years of the formation of Patna AIIMS, emergency services have not started here
 yahaan par alag se apatkaal vibhaag jarur bana hua he magar karyrat nahin he
 In such a situation, if a patient is brought here in serious condition, then he is referred to Patna Medical College or Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science from here
 patna ames main apatkaal sevaayen uplabdh nahin he, saath hi troma centre kii bhi kami saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 Even today, blood bank services are not available in Patna AIIMS
 blad bank ke liye alag se ek block kaa nirmaan kiya ja chukaa he magar yah abhi tak karyrat nahin he
 Patna AIIMS was constructed thinking that people of Bihar and Jharkhand would be able to come here and get their treatment and for this reason 28 operation theaters were built in this big institute but the condition is that today only four operation theaters work are doing
 sutron kii maane to patna ames main specialist doctoron kii bhi baari kami he
 The central government has sanctioned posts for 304 doctors and teachers in Patna AIIMS, but even after 5 years, the situation is that only 50 doctors are employed here
 yojana ke mutabik patna ames ko 1000 bed vaala aspataal banaaya janaa tha or is santhaan kii kshamta bhi itani hi he magar aaj ke din yahaan keval 200 bed uplabdh hai
 Even today there is no mortuary in Patna AIIMS, due to which the post-mortem of someone is not possible even if there is unnatural death here
 ajtakane patna ames ke andar pahunchakar halaat kaa jayja liya to paaya ki 5 saal biit jane ke baad bhi yahaan par ab tak nirmaan kaa kaary chal hi rahaa he
 Many trucks start coming daily to the hospital where patients live and where cleanliness should be done
 isamen baaluu, cement, it or saria lod rahata he
 Construction work is still underway at five locations of the hospital
 ganne or gud kii jameen mana jaataa rahaa he mujffarnagar ko

 hawa main bhini mithaas rakhane vaale hamaare ilaake main is tarah ke dange kabhi hue nahin
 Jats and Muslims or other castes also never heard of such death
 vahaan log bade pyaar se or aapasi samaj-boojh ke saath rahete aae hai
 My village Budhana is only 30 km from Muzaffarnagar
 jis tarah ke halaat is dfa mujffarnagar main bane, aise main vahaan bhi hone ko kuch bhi ho saktaa tha lekin logon ne jaraa-sa bhi kuch hone nahin diya
 i feel really proud for this
 aai feel rili proud for dait
 There people of every community showed complete understanding and decided that nothing like this should be allowed to happen
 varna politics to yahi karti ai he
 Sometimes state politics, sometimes caste, sometimes religion
 yah logon par bahut kuch nirbhar karata he ki ve use kitni tarjeeh dete hai
 It is all made up of politicians, politics
 siyasatdan hi logon ko dhire-dhire ek aise plateform par laakar khadaa kar dete hai
 The event is something else, the form is given something else
 politysiuns sab ek jaise hote hai, ve kisi bhi party ke hon
 He has no other religion
 bevakoof to log hai, jo unke bahekaave main aa jate hai
 To be honest, i do not accept the fault of even the politicians because when we know that such things happen during the election, such bets are played then people should have been cautious themselves
 netaa to ellection ke maukey par har tarah se chijen bhunaanaa chaahate hai
 It is not their fault
 hamen hi samajhnaa hoga
 i am living in Mumbai
 yahaan se bhi shooting vagairah ke silsile main aksar baahar hi aana-janaa laga rahata he
 But since the riots, whenever i have spoken to the people of the village, they are also completely shocked and amazed
 ve yahi kah rahe hai ki hamaare aasapaas ke gaanv-kasbon main pehali baar hua he
 What are the householders, all the Tyagi, Muslims, Jats and people of all societies are in shock
 sabase bada paap hota he duniya main kisi ko khatm karnaa
 And what could be more tragic than the way people were killed in the riots
 jo bhi hua he, uske bare main sun-jaanakar vaaki behad afsos ho rahaa he
 Panchayats have been a special identity of our region
 khaskar main apane gaanv kii baat karun to vahaan maine dekha tha ki chote-bade or kai baar jatil maamle bhi police thanon main jane kii bajaae, har birdari ke bade-bujurgon kii panchayat bulaakar aaraam se nibata liye jate the
 If the case goes awry, obviously the police was there for him
 lekin yah dhyaan rakhaa jaataa tha ki panchayaton kaa bhi durupyog na ho
 There is no doubt that the tone and attitude of the people there has been a bit aggressive and it always has been
 desh yaa pradesh ke duusare ilaakon ke mukaable vahaan kaa aadmi kisi bhi majahab, jati kaa ho, usamen ek agreson hota hi he
 But nobody goes to this extreme, to this extent
 iske liye ho saktaa he, ek maahaul banaaya gaya ho or logon ko bargalaaya gaya ho
 All this will be the result of that
 vahaan mere bahut-saare hindu dost hai, sabake massej mere paas aa rahe hai
 Everyone is praying for peace
 yah sab koi nahin chahta, har aadmi apana kamanaa-khaanaa chahta he
 By the way, the area is in bad shape
 main sadak se hokar ghar jane ke liye jab dilli se baithta hum to raste main netaaon ke ek hajaar poster milenge or duusari ore usee sadak par ek hajaar gadde milenge
 Nobody raises a voice against them, man, how are you doing! This is the situation for the last 25-30 years
 vikaas naam kii koi cheez he nahin vahaan par
 So do not fight for these things instead of such riots, brother! The educated people there leave from there because there are no facilities
 iske liye aap kisi ek sarkaar ko bhi doshi nahin tehra sakate ki bhai bijepi kii yaa congress kii yaa kisi bhi ek party kii galati he
 This is the fault of the people there
 sab haath par haath rakh ke baithe hue hai, unako kuch fark padataa nahin
 When the people living there themselves are not raising questions, why would anyone think otherwise? The danger has been averted
 mujhe yakeen he ki vahaan aman-chaun ho jayega
 There are no thieves and bandits living there
 ek unmaad tha, ek impact tha, uski lapet main sab log aa gaye
 Looking at the way people have lived there, i hope that the fabric there will not break
 koi nahin chahta ki unmaad faile
 That area really needs a cultural-social movement
 us tarah kii activities kii vahaan sakht jarurat mahasoos kii ja rahi he
 Actually what is there is a long gap between two crops
 ek fasal cat gai or duusari fasal main abhi samay he
 So in such a time, during that, it would be good to have something for social, cultural reform
 isse vahaan ke logon ko ek-duusare ke aachaar-vyavhaar or paramparaon ko sahi sandarbh main jaanane or usase judye kaa mauka mil sakegaa
 i sincerely hope that the same sweetness will return to the fija there

 a Delhi court told the Delhi Police on a petition filed by the NGO 'india Angry Corruption' and its three members for filing an FIR against President Pranab Mukherjee for making 'baseless' and 'defamatory' allegations
 File the implementation report

 tej gendbaaj eshanth sharma ke karier kii sarvshereshth gendbaaji ke dam par bharat kam score ke baavjood duusare test cricket match main westeindies par badhat hasil karne main safal rahaa
 However, the rain again emerged as the villain, due to which only 42 overs were played on the third day
 eshanth ne 55 ran dekar chah wicket lekar westeindies ko 190 ran par out karne main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 India, who scored 201 runs in the first innings, got an 11-run lead in this way
 barish ke kaaran bharat kii duusari pari main keval 5
 There was only a 4-over game in which he scored 23 runs without any loss
 bharat kii badhat ab 34 ran kii ho gayi he
 Abhinav Mukund was on eight and Murali Vijay was on three when the umpires announced the end of the day's play due to intermittent rain
 bhartiya tej gendbaaj eshanth sharma or westeindies ke madhyakram ke ballebaaj malaren sampuls yadi tisare din ke nayak rahe to barish phir se khalanaayak bani
 After the end of the West Indies innings, India had only five overs in the second innings when the rain came due to which tea had to be taken early
 iske baad bhi barish nahin thami jisase do ghante kaa khel barabaad hua
 The game resumed at 5
10 pm local time but only four balls had to be stopped due to poor lighting
 iske baad ampiron ne din kaa khel samaapt ghoshit kar diya
 Most of the game of the second day, after the rain fell, the game started only after about 35 minutes on the third day
 westeindies ne paanch wicket par 98 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya lekin chandrapal or sampuls ne vipareet paristhatiyon ke baavjood dhary ke saath ballebaaji kii or team kii jarurat ko dekhte hue wicket bachaaye rakhane ko tarjeeh di
 India finally got the first breakthrough of the day through Chandrapal's mistake
 mithun kii round da wicket aakar kii gayi short pich gend main adhik oochaal nahin thi lekin chandrapal ise pul karne ke uddeshy se baikfoot par chale gayi
 He failed in this and the ball took the edge of his bat and fell into the wickets
 lunch ke baad harbhajan ne naye ballebaaj carlton bow kii spin ke khilaaf kamajori kaa phayda uthaaya
 He tried to drive off Harbhajan's ball but it took the outside edge of his bat and reached to Rahul Dravid standing in the first slip
 dravid ne dhoni ke kareeb se nikali gend ko apane baayin taraf kaich kiya
 The game halted for about 20 minutes due to rain in between
 tab westeindies kaa score aath wicket par 189 ran tha lekin iske baad westeindies kii pari teen gend ke andar simat gayi
 Ishant continued his over ahead, giving India the lead by dismissing Ravi Rampal and Fidel Edwards (both zero) on consecutive balls
 eshanth ne apane karier kaa sarvshereshth pradarshan kiya
 He had earlier taken five wickets for 115 runs against Pakistan in 2007 in Bangalore
 unhone apane karier main duusari baar pari main paanch yaa isse adhik wicket liye
 India lead the series 1-0, winning the first Test match at Kingston by 63 runs
 kendra sarkaar ke jari nae aankadon ke mutabik maujuuda vitt varsh main 29 main se 23 rajya or 8 main se 6 kendra shashit rajyon ke paas jarurat se adhik bijli hogi
 According to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), 8 out of the total power requirement in the country in FY 2017-18
 8 fisadi adhik supplai hogi
 At the same time, 6 in the country at the peak of electricity consumption
 8 fisadi adhik supplai bani rahegi
 In such a situation, the question arises from the Yogi Adityanath government of Uttar Pradesh that when there is a possibility of more power supply in the entire country, then why is there no continuous power supply in Uttar Pradesh? Significantly, since assuming power in the state, the Chief Minister has taken many stringent steps to improve the power supply system in the state
 iske alaava rajya sarkaar ne agle do saal ke andar uttar pradesh ko 24 ghante bijli supplai ke map par laane kii he
 But despite the efforts of the Yogi government to repair the power system and help the central government, the power crisis in the state is deepening due to the collapse of the units of its own power houses
 lihaaja, jahaan central electricity athurity desh main bijli sarplus kaa daawa kar rahi he, uttar pradesh main bijli katautee lagaataar sachai bani hui he
 The rural areas of the state are suffering the most due to the power crisis
 shahari ilaakon main bijli supplai behaal rakhane ke liye energy exange or duusare rajyon se kareeb 2000 megawatt bijli kharidkar halaat sanbhaalane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 Is going on gauratlab he ki pradesh main lalitpur bijli ghar kii 660 megawatt kii ek unit, anapara kii 600 megawatt, lanko kii 600 megawatt or baaraa kii 660 megawatt kii ek-ek unit thap pad chuki hai
 Due to the collapse of these big units, the state is going to suffer a shock of power shortage of around 2500 MW
 iske chalate gramin ilaakon main do se chaar ghante tak aghoshit bijli katautee kii ja rahi he vahiin shahari ilaakon main bhi aghoshit katautee dekhne ko mil rahi he
 Ashok Gehlot, the sorcerer of the politics of Rajasthan, took the oath of Chief Minister for the third time
 rajasthan kii raajnneeti main maas leader ke taur par yadi kisi kaa naam sabase upar hoga to wo ashok gahalot hai
 His name is among the leaders closest to Rahul
 payalat: viraasat main mili siyasatgalot jahaan satta kii kaman sanbhaalenge vahiin sachin payalat kii dipti siem ke taur par tajopishi kii gai
 The pilot has inherited the politics
 unke pita rajesh payalat pradesh ke bade gurjar netaaon main se ek the
 Sachin Pilot is considered close to Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 2014 main congress kii haar ke baad party netritv ne 21 janvari ko sachin payalat par bharosa kiya or unhen pradesh adhyaksh banaaya
 His five years of hard work brought Congress back in power
 aise main unhen rajasthan ke up mukhyamantri kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 He was sworn in in the presence of Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 rajasthan ke siyaasi jaadugar gahalotabata den ki rajasthan kii raajnneeti main jaateey varchasv ko todate hue sheersh par pahunchane vaale netaaon main yadi kisi kaa naam sabase aage aayega he to wo ashok gahalot hai
 He is going to become the Chief Minister for the third time in the state
 gahalot kaa parivaar mali samaaj se aata he
 His family used to perform magic tricks once upon a time
 rajasthan kii raajnneetik rup se alpsankhyak or kamjor jati se aane vaale gahalot ne apane kaarykaal main rajasthan main aisa jaadu chalaaya jisaki kaat abhi kisi ke paas nahin hegujarat ke prabharee ke taur par unhone vahaan kii yuva tikdi hardik-alpesh-jignesh ko congress ke saath khadaakar party ko jeet kii dahalij par laa khadaa kiya
 After this, Gehlot emerged as the right hand of President Rahul Gandhi under the central leadership of the party, General Secretary Gehlot
 indira kii padi najar, sanjay ne dilaai pahachaatshok gahalot ko 70 ke dashak main congress main shaamil hone kaa mauka mila tha, jab purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke samay party main sanjay gandhi kii chalati thi
 When Sanjay Gandhi's close acquaintances told him about Ashok Gehlot, he made Gehlot the president of the party's student organization NSUI in Rajasthan
 gahalot ko shuruaati dinon main sanjay gandhi kii mandali ke log 'gili billy' kahkar sambodhit karte the
 Some believe that Ashok Gehlot was first noticed by Indira Gandhi herself
 jab purvi pakistan (ab bangladesh) main vidroh ke baad purvottar main sharnaarthi sankat khadaa ho gaya tha
 Gehlot was 20 years old at the time, and Indira invited him to join politics
 jiske baad gahalot ne akhil bhartiya congress cameti ke indore sammelan main hissaa liya or yaheen unki mulaakaat sanjay gandhi se hui
 a period of expansion of the Youth Congress, which many strong leaders gave to the Indore Conference of Congress, the late leader Priyaranjan Dasmunsi was elected President of the Youth Congress
 yah wo samay tha jab indira or sanjay gandhi yuva congress ko dakshin panthi jansangh or uske sahyogi sanghathan se mukaable ke liye taiyaar karnaa chaahate the
 Experts believe that this period in the Congress was the golden period of the rise of the youth leadership
 is dauraan party ko kai ahm netaa mili jisamen ashok gahalot, kamalnath, digvijay singh, ambika soni, vylar ravi, eke antni, gulam nabi aaazaad or bike hariprasad shaamil hai
 All these leaders hold great position in today's Congress
 apane swabhaav or saadhaaran prishthbhumi ke anuroop ashok gahalot rajasthan main lo profile rahete hue kaam karte rahe
 But when Rajiv Gandhi got an important role in the party after the death of Sanjay Gandhi in a plane crash, he recommended Gehlot's name as Minister of State in Indira Gandhi's cabinet
 is dauraan rajasthan main congress ke do bade netaa purv mukhyamantri haridev joshi or shivacharan maathur kaa bolbalaa tha
 But Gehlot had the trust of Rajiv Gandhi
 wo ghatana jisane gahalot kaa rasta kiya safaek mashhoor vakya he jab rajasthan bheeshan sookhe se jujh rahaa tha or purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne dilli se 170 kimi dur sariska neshnal park main cabinet kii baithak bulaai thi
 In this meeting, Rajiv had instructed all the ministers of the state to come by their car instead of government vehicles and Rajiv himself was driving a private car
 tabhi ek trephic consteble ne rajeev kii car ko sidhe jane kaa signal dene ke bajaay daahine mudane ke liye kaha
 The result of this mistake by the constable proved costly for Haridev Joshi, because of the diversion, Rajiv reached the place where the ministers' official vehicles were parked
 darasal rajeev iske jariye party or sarkaar main mitvyayita kaa sandesh dena chaah rahe the
 Joshi did not attend the lunch due to Rajiv Gandhi's displeasure, in the absence of host Joshi, his friend and HRD minister PV Narasimha Rao at the Center tried unsuccessfully to cool the case
 or is ghatana ke ek maheene baad haridev joshi ko badalakar shivacharan maathur ko rajasthan kaa mukhyamantri bana diya gaya
 Even though Joshi has returned again after almost two years, after that the Congress high command has not been able to beat him
 centre main bhi chodi amit chhapis dauraan gahalot centre sarkaar main paryaton mantri kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe the
 The credit for the construction of the Delhi Haat just opposite the INA Market in the national capital goes to Gehlot, who worked to deliver the products of artisans, artisans and artisans from all over the country directly to the customers without any middlemen
 rajeev se gahalot kii najdiki ne sonia gandhi or uske baad rahul gandhi kii adhyakshata vaali congress main unki bhoomika kam nahin hone di
 The BJP lost the 1998 assembly elections and Ashok Gehlot was made the Chief Minister after Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 gahalot is samay vidhayak nahin the, lihaaja jodhpur ke sardarpura vidhansabha se vidhayak maansingh devda ne unke liye seat khaali kar di
 After this, Gehlot has been an MLA from this seat continuously since the victory in the by-elections
 jaaton kaa congress se mohabhangajankaron kii maane to mali samudaay se aane vaale ashok gahalot ke mukhyamantri banane par congress ko rajasthan main apane paaramparik jat vot kaa nuksaan hua
 The Jats, who are strongly opposed to the Rajputs, play a crucial role in 60-70 seats in Rajasthan
 rajya main pehle vidhansabha chunaav se hi jaaton kaa jhukaav congress kii taraf rahaa kyonki congress ne rajshahi khatm kii
 Major Jat leaders of the Congress Ramnivas Mirdha, Nathuram Mirdha, Parasaram Maderna had a strong influence in Marwar
 in netaaon ne immergency ke baad bhi jab congress kaa uttar bharat se safaya ho gaya tha tab congress kaa yah kila dhahne nahin diya
 For a long time, the leaders of this community look forward to becoming the Chief Minister for their loyalty
 lekin 1998 main ashok gahalot ke siem banane ke baad inkaa moh bhang hota chalaa gaya
 Gehlot is still accepted as a mass leader in Rajasthan politics, if someone's name is at the top, he will be Ashok Gehlot
 raajnneetik rup se alpsankhyak or kamjor jati se aane vaale gahalot ne apane kaarykaal main rajasthan main aisa jaadu chalaaya jisaki kaat abhi kisi ke paas nahin he
 Gehlot's political prowess was that in 1998, he reached the pinnacle of power, leaving behind Parasram Maderna, a strong contender for the chief minister

 Policy is more important than intended, Yadav said
 sabhi sarkaron kii logon kaa bhala karne kii manshaa hoti he
 But the issue is whether the government has any policy and program to fulfill it

 Facing criticisms on the new Land Acquisition Bill, PM Modi had argued that since he has been among the farmers, he can understand his sorrow and is working with a good intention to remove his troubles
 piem ke bayaan par sharad yadav ne kaha, iraade kaa kya matlab he, jab uske saath koi thos niti yaa kaarykram na hon
 Only when policy and intention are mixed together, only then do the results emerge

 The first encounter did not prove to be harmful for Bollywood
 ek hi taarikh ko relies do badi filmorekshay kumaarakigoldeur jon abraham-manoj bajpeyi kii satyamev jayate ko darshakon ne khub pasand diya
 Both films have collected more than their cost at the ticket window
 donon filmein swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par 15 agast ko relies hui thim
 Rajkummar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor starrer horror comedy "stree" is releasing on August 31
 isi taarikh par deol tikdi "yamala pagalaa divaana phir" se lekar aa rahe hai
 After the trailer of both the films, the audience's interest in the film has increased
 aise main box offis par bhidnt se nuksaan kii ashanka se inkaar nahin kar sakate
 Trade estimates of both films are coming out before release
 pehali najar main donon filmein barabari par dikh rahi hai
 One common trend regarding the first day opening is that there will be a fierce competition between the two
 bhartiya bazaar main pehle din donon hi filmein 2
 Can do business of 50 to 3 crores
 haalanki, kuch duusari reports main dharmendra, sani deol, bobi deol or kriti kharbanda stararyamala pagalaa divaana phir seki openingstrise zyada bataai ja rahi he
 Super Cinema has estimated that Yamla Pagla Deewana may again do a business of 5 crores on the first day
 film kaa bajet kareeb 32 karod bataaya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, about the first day collection of women made in the budget of about 25 crores, it is estimated that these 3
 15 karod tak kaa kaarobaar kar sakati he
 However, the return of the Deol Trio in a film after five years can give the film a big boost at the box office
 film main salmaan khan, rekha, shatrughna sinha jaise sitaron kaa chemiyo bhi phayda pahunchane main madad kar saktaa he
 This film will get the benefit of release in small centers
 is film ko lekar baj mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 This film of Deol Trio may earn as much as it did at the box office, but given the inference, it is clear that the film will not be able to repeat its old record at the box office
 haalanki content ke lihaaj se "stri" deol tikdi kii film se kisi myne main kamjor nahin he
 The trailer of the film is quite interesting
 isamen rajkumaar or shraddha ke alaava pankaj treepathi, aparshakti khurana jaise manze abhinaytaon ne kaam kiya he
 Amar Kaushik has directed the film
 vaise kaaphi had tak sambhaavna he ki stri ko mouth publicity mili or weekend main film kii kamai par iskaa asar dikhe
 Although the distribution of screens has not been revealed in both the films, but it is believed that both will get satisfactory shows
 yamala pagalaa divaana 2 ne weekend main kamaaye the 22 karodpanch saal pehle yamala pagalaa divaana 2 ne weekend main 22 karod se zyada kaa kaarobaar kiya tha
 However, most of the reviews of the film were very poor
 film trade analist taran adarsh ne kaarobaar aankade saajha kiye the
 According to this, the earnings of the first day 7
 50 karod, duusare din kii kamai 6
 05 crores and third day earnings 8
 25 karod thi
 In this way, the film has a 22-day weekend
 25 karod kaa kaarobaar kiya tha
 By the way, the film trade experts must be hoping that both the films released in late August should do good business

 At the same time, Maken believes that athletes and officials may be complicit in this entire episode
 maakan ne kaha, "pratibandhit padaarth patiala ke rashtriya khel santhaan (enaies) main kaise pahunche iskaa hamen pataa lagaana he
 Since these banned substances are found in the premises of NIS, this indicates collusion between athletes and officials
