 yah tascaforce rashtriya suraksha par congress ko apni raay degi
 Its report will come before the election which Congress can include in its election manifesto
 is task force main alag alag kshetron ke kai export honge jo rashtriya suraksha par apni raay denge
 DS Hooda spoke to India Today Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai on Thursday
 task force ke bare main unhone vistaar se bataaya or yah bhi saaf kar diya ki ve task force kaa hissaa jarur hai lekin congress join nahin kar rahe hai
 Hooda said, 'right now my job is to join the task force
 is team main alag-alag kshetron ke kai visheshgy honge
 Those involved in the military, diplomacy and police forces will be involved
 sabaki koshish hogi desh main suraksha ke mudde par ek khaas ranneeti banane kii
 The challenge at the moment is how to devise a strategy for the task force
 hamaara dhyaan is par he ki suraksha or diplomasi ke mudde par task force agle paanch saal ke liye kaise kaam kare
 i am not joining the Congress party
 'india today ne hooda se poocha, kya yah dwipaksheeya maamla he jisamen task force sarkaar or vipaksh donon ko suzav degi
 Or to suggest to the Congress party that a strategy should be made on security so that an incident like Pulwama does not happen in future
 iske jawaab main dies hooda ne kaha, 'task force kuch nitiyaan banaaegi jo desh kii suraksha nitiyon ko kuch nirdesh de sake
 i talked to Rahul Gandhi about this
 unhone ise banane kaa suzav diya tha jisapar main samahat ho gaya
 Once the report related to this comes to us, everything will be told about it in public
 'hooda ne india today se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki 'mere khyal se yah acchhee baat he jo rashtriya suraksha par baatcheet chal rahi he
 This is something that the country has long needed
 task force kii puri report aane ke baad isapar vistrut charchaa hogi, logon kii raay lee jaaegi or ise jarurat padane par sudhara bhi jayega
 It will be a good thing that all people will be able to see, hear and understand it
 'rajdeep saradesai ne hooda se poocha ki 'aap rahul gandhi kii is yojana par kaam kar rahe hai to ise congress policy group kaa bhi naam diya ja saktaa he
 You may find it difficult to adopt the government considering the positive suggestions you give
 is mudde kaa bhi raajnneetik dhruvikaran ho saktaa he
 Are you worried that your name is stuck between Congress and BJP? On this, Hooda said, 'worries are everywhere but be sure if you are doing something good or doing it in the national interest, then such concerns can be bypassed
 main saaf kar dena chahta hum ki congress adhyaksh ne task force banane kaa suzav diya tha
 This was discussed long before the Pulwama attack
 isliye ham ise pulavama se sidhaa jodakar nahin dekh sakate
 'the next question was, was it discussed long before the Pulwama attack
 kya aap maanate hai ki sargical strike-2 kii jarurat padegi kyonki javaanon kii shahadat jari he, aatanki hamale bhi ho rahe hai
 So, what will be the impact of these incidents on this task force? On this, Hooda said that 'it is definitely on my mind that some action should be taken after the Pulwama attack
 sarkaar ne bhi kaha he ki vah aage karrwai karegi
 Everyone is coming forward and talking about joining together
 nishchit taur par ab baat pehle vaali nahin hogi jo ab tak hoti ai he
 On this, Rajdiv Sardesai asked the question that what should it mean that the government will give a befitting reply against terrorism
 yaa phir koi karrwai karne se pehle hamen saavdhaanee baratani chahie? is par hooda ne kaha ki hamen har kadam par soch samaj kar faisla lenaa chahie
 i am confident that those who are in authority will take any step after talking to the army
 meraa maananaa he ki logon ke jajbaat ko dekhakar koi faisla nahin liya janaa chahie
 Yes, we must take some steps
 iske kya vikalp ho sakate hai, baad main uski pratikriya kya hogi, is par gambhirtha se baatcheet honi chahie
 This is not a one-sided process, so we have to move forward thoughtfully, but i also believe that now is not the time to sit with folded hands
 pulavama hamale ke baad intelegence kii naakaami par sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 Questions are also being asked on how the 300 kg explosive reached the site of the incident
 aise sawaal public main uthaae jane chahie yaa nahin, is par bhi bahes ho rahi he
 On this, Hooda replied that there is nothing wrong in asking such questions but more than that we should not focus on the past
 aage aisi ghatnaayen na hon, iske liye kya kiya janaa chahie, isapar baat honi chahie
 Talking on an incident in the past will not solve the issue
 antim sawaal ki kya aapako lagata he ki task force kii report chunaav se pehle aegi or yah menifesto kaa hissaa hogi, yaa yah maamla lanbaa khinchne vaala he
 In response to this, Hooda said that the report will come before the election, so we are following a 30-day timeframe

 is hawa se jediu ko to ko phayda nahin mila, lekin raajnneeti ke haashie par khadey ajit singh ko jarur sanjivani mil gai
 His question in BJP increased
 jediu sanghathan ko deni hogi majbooteeuttar pradesh kii siyasat main samaajawaadee, bahujan samaaj party or bhartiya janata party ek majboot dhuri ke rup main pehle se hi maujuud hai
 The roots of the organization of the three are also very deep, so the leaders of JDU also believe that the fight is not easy
 lekin jo mudde uthaaye ja rahe hai usamen kuch na kuch safalataa jarur milegi
 The party is ready to play the backward card this time in Uttar Pradesh
 vot bank kaa ganitiske saath hi nitish kii koshish bihar kii tarj par upi main bhi mahila votaron main baith banane kii hogi
 For this, like in Bihar, they can move forward with 50 percent reservation for women in panchayats, 35 percent reservation in police and liquor ban
 unhen ummid he ki party ko kuch na kuch jarur safalataa milegi
 The question is half the population
 duusari taraf upi main ati pichhadaa bhi acchhee khaasi sankhya main hai
 While Nitish Kumar's own caste Kurmi also has 8 percent votes and Maurya 6 percent
 aise main yadi sab saath khadey hue to safalataa milani tay maani ja rahi he
 Who will be the face of JDU in UP? The biggest truth is that JDU will have to work hard in UP
 khaskar sanghathan ke maamle main
 Secondly, the party does not have a big face in Uttar Pradesh
 lekin party ummid main he kijediu ko aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavamein bahut zyada bhale hi na mili, lekin vah apni upasthiti jarur darj karavaaegi
 
 
 
 lekin pehle bihar kii leni hogi sudek or jo nitish kumaar ko dhyaan main rakhni hogi vah yah ki upi main unka rasta bihar ko hokar jaataa he
 That is, they will have to do a very good job in Bihar before the elections
 khaskar aparaadh niyantran ke kshetra main
 Incidents such as murder of journalist in Siwan, road rage in Gaya, murder of engineer in Darbhanga have given opportunity to the opposition

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's announcement of waiving electricity bill of up to 200 units in Delhi has been termed by Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari as an election lollipop
 unhone ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki jab bhi chunaav aata he, turant arvind kejariwal free vaali ghoshnaaen karne main jute jate hai
 Manoj Tiwari said that 54 months have passed, now the promise of 200 units free has been received

 Now the public is trying to deceive the election again
 BJP kejariwal se dilli kii janata se vasule gaye fiks charge kii dhanrashi ko waapas karne kii maang karti he
 For this, BJP will also hit the road
 naaraa hoga - kejariwal karo rifund, varanaa dilli degi dand
 Now the same question arises that when you will return 7000 crores which you have taken in the name of fixed charges
 dilli kii janata ko ek-ek paisa waapas karnaa padegaa
 The people of Delhi are not going to come in these promises now
 yah sirf or sirf ek chunavi nuskhaa he
 The people of Delhi know well
 dilli ke chunaav par iskaa koi asar nahin hone vaala he
 People now remember that they come to the polls by lying
 udhar, dilli vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh vijendra gupta ne kaha ki kejariwal nayaa shigupha lekar aae hai
 Delhi's tax payer feels cheated
 na nai bas, na nayaa aspataal, na nayaa skool
 
 
 If people ask questions, the case of lies is being misled
 aise vaayade vahi karte hai jo janata ke liye kaam nahin karte hai

 saath hi unhone kaha ki jo jo log dilli main bijli kii 200 unit tak khapat karte hai, unako apane bijli ke bill dene kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Their electricity bills will be forgiven
 yah ghoshnaa isliye sambhav hui kyonki dilli ke logon ne ek eemaandaar sarkaar ko chunaa he
 He also said that if a person uses 201 units of electricity, he will have to pay full amount

 Ever since Raj Kumar Rao's film Newton was nominated for the Oscars, a new controversy has arisen
 pehle kaha gaya ki ye irani film sikret ballat kii copy he
 Now a new disclosure has come out regarding its poster
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is film kaa poster sathyajith re kii film ganashatru se miltaa-julata he
 Oscar-winning Satyajit Ray's film Ganashtru came out in 1990

 There is a lot of similarity between the poster of the Newton film and the poster released at that time

 The film was released in 2001

 But since the talk of such similarities came to light, the film has also started to be criticized a lot
 iskaa asar auskar ke liye film kii daavedaari par bhi pad saktaa he
 But the important question on this whole issue is that Newton had its world premiere at the 67th Berlin Film Festival
 tab is film ne international federation of art cinema aword bhi jeeta tha
 At that time, there was no mention of its similarity with any other film
 ab jab se film auskar ke liye nominete hui he, ise lekar naye-naye vivaad or khulaase saamne aa rahe hai
 Newton is released last Friday
 ise desh bhar main 350 screens par relies kiya gaya he
 Directed by Amit Masurkar, the film stars Newton as Rajkumar Rao

 Newton has been chosen from 26 films

 Story of Newton: The story of the film is of Nutan Kumar (rajkumar Rao) who changed his girl's name by writing 'newton' on the tenth board
 ab sabhi log use newton ke naam se hi jaanate hai
 Newton studied msc in Physics
 chunaav ke samay uski duty lagati he
 He has to go to the naxal-affected area of the forest to get voting
 vahaan jane par use pataa chalata he ki vahaan sirf 76 voters hai, lekin voting vaale din koi nahin aata
 In such a situation, what Newton does and how much the situation changes is the main climax of the film
 irani film se samantairani filmasikret ballatako babak payami ne diarect kiya tha

 It is being said that the main character of both the films takes the initiative to contest in opposite circumstances

 salmaan khan ke daulatmand banane kii paanch kahaniyaan hai or ye baat khud salmaan khan ne bataai hai
 In twelve hours, Salman turned silver and his heart became gold
 salmaan ke daulatmand banane kii kahani number vansalmaan ne subah-subah anaaj kii boriyaan uthaai thi to shaam hote- hote salmaan ko chaandi kii silliyon se tol diya gaya
 How much weight Salman must have lifted
 yaheen koi tees chalis kilo
 The price of thirty forty kilo grains will be four to five hundred rupees
 lekin badalen main is mazdooree kii keemat kya mili? salmaan ko unke vajan ke baraabar unhen chaandi se tol gaya
 When about ninety kilos of silver were mounted on the scales, the fork became equal
 wo to acha he ki ramajaan kaa maheenaa he varanaa salmaan ke vajan kii barabari karne ke liye or zyada chaandi kii zarurat padati
 This silver weighing Salman was bought by a Dubai businessman
 sochie haal main hi salmaan kaa ek tawel 1
 If it was auctioned in 50 lakhs, how would this silver in the name of Salman have contributed to its wealth? salmaan ko khushi is baat kii he ye daulat unki sanstha beeing human ke jariye sidhe sidhe zarurat mando tak jaaegi
 But how did Salman Khan's heart turn to gold during these twelve hours? Salman had spent his morning in the morning on the children who are reading the lesson of humanity in Mumbai's child improvement home amidst poverty and deprivation
 yahi to karishma he dil lutaaney kaa
 The heart that Salman had was associated with the goodness of humanity, then it became gold
 insaaniyat ke liye abhi to salmaan ne sirf mazdooree kii he
 Salman has just opened the door of the heart to the needy and Salman has become silver and gold
 pataa nahin kya hoga jab salmaan tan, man or dhan sab lutaaney par amada ho jaaege
 The story of Salman's wealth becoming dull is the number two story in which the story of Salman becoming rich and Dilipkumar's bankruptcy
 ye baat un dinon kii he jab salmaan khan apni film maine pyaar kiya ke audishan ke liye ja rahe the
 This is where the story of Salman Khan's wealthiness begins
 pehle audishan ke liye jate vakt salmaan khan kii mulaakaat ho gai dilip kumaar sahab se
 Dilip Kumar gave Salman Khan a purse and a rupee coin and said go earn money
 bas uske baad daulat kaa dariyaa salmaan ke dar par tha
 That purse of Dilip Kumar gifted was truly magical
 salmaan ne use ek pal ke liye bhi apane se alag nahin kiya lekin saalon ke baad jab wo purse fat gaya to salmaan phir dilip sahab ke paas gayi to dilip kumaar ne haath khadey kar diye or kahaan jeene ke liye mujhe bhi kuch daulat kii zarurat he
 The lucky coin given by Salman Khan to Salman Khan, the story number three of Salman becoming rich
 salmaan ne use ek bhikhaari ko taras khaakar de diya
 See Salman's heart while giving coin to beggar
 salmaan kii soch ye thi ki jis sikke ne unki takadir badal di wo shaayad wo sikaa is bhikhaari kii takadir ko bhi palat de
 It seems that Lord Salman was taking the test of his heart
 us daur main salmaan kii filmein pit rahi thi bhikhaari ne ye kah kar salmaan ko sikaa lautaa diya ki is vakt is sikke kii zarurat mujhase zyada aapako he
 If not Salman's generosity, what else is there, even after plundering his dearest thing salmaan ke paas dil kii daulat he shaayad isi liye takadir ne unhen daulatmand banane main koi kami nahin
 Salman Khan was being weighed with silver ingots by Salman Khan, the story of Salman becoming rich, when his brother and two sisters were issuing gold coins for the earnings of their organization, Being Human, for the welfare of the needy
 Was with them
 ye parivaar hi salmaan kii takat he
 Love for the family Salman inherited from his parents, but the big heart that Salman inherited from his father Salim made him rich with a big heart
 salmaan ke daulatmand banane kii kahani number paanchaye kahani us din kii he jab salmaan bahut chote bachche the
 It was the day of Diwali
 sari duniya pataakhe chhod rahi thi to salmaan khan apane pita ke purse se paise nikaal nikaal kar jala rahe the
 These five stories of Salman are enough to understand why Salman has so much wealth
 agar salmaan kii ye paanchon kahaniyaan sachhee he to yakeen maniye salmaan ke dil saamne unki ye daulat phir bhi bahut kam he

 Pakistan is finding it most difficult for India to remove Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan is faisle se baukhala gaya he
 At the behest of him, his friend China has now raised the issue with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
 is par chlose door meeting bhi ho rahi he, lekin pakistan ko yaad hona chahie ki kuch isi tarah 1971 main bhi UNSC kii kashmir masale par baithak hui thi lekin kuch ho nahin paaya tha
 In fact, when a war broke out between India and Pakistan in 1971 and Bangladesh was born, our neighbor came to the United Nations asylum after being defeated in battle
 lekin tab UNSC ne is masale ko dwipaksheeya masalaa hi bataaya diya tha
 Even after that, Pakistan tried to take the Kashmir issue to UNSC but this issue could not arise every time because of Russia
 rus ne har baar bharat ke paksh main vot kiya
 Even before 1971, this case reached the court of UNSC in 1965
 samachar agency PTI kii ek report ke mutabik, sanyukt raashtra ke aankade darshaate hai ki 1964-65 main jammu-kashmir ke masale par baithak hui thi
 On January 16, 1964, Pakistan wrote to the United Nations
 kashmir masale par pakistan ne turant baithak bulaane kii maang kii thi or bharat ke khilaaf shikaayat kii thi
 However, even then nothing of Pakistan was good
 tab ke baad ab ye maamla sanyukt raashtra main is tarah pahunchaa he
 Every time India has been opposing the entry of any third party on this issue and has been calling it a bilateral issue
 haalanki, bharat kii bhi ek shart rahi he jisamen vah pakistan se pehle aatankwaad khatm karne par baat karata he or phir kisi tarah kii baat ko aage badhanaa chahta he
 Now this request of Pakistan is being heard in UNSC because of his friend China

 Pakistan is not strict towards Masood, recently it was reported that Masood Azhar has been detained in Pakistan, but now sources said that he was neither arrested nor detained
 sutron ne bataaya ki masood ke teen saathiyon ko jarur hiraasat main liya gaya tha, lekin in teenon ko pathankot hamale ko lekar hiraasat main nahin liya gaya tha
 Pakistan was also not officially confirmed by the news that Masoodsud Azhar was taken into custody
 pakistan ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa khalilulla kaaji ne haal main kaha tha ki is bare main unhen koi jaankaree nahin he
 Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup had also said that India has not been given any official information about the arrest of Masood Azhar from Pakistan
 pakistan ne nahin kii thos karrwipakistan sarkaar ne bharat ke dabaav ke baad kaha tha, 'aatankwaad kisi bhi tarah se bardaasht nahin kiya jayega

 Women archers are expected to win the medal The Indian men's archery team had reached the pre-quarterfinals at the 2012 London Olympics
 lekin rio main bharat kii purush team kwalifai tak nahin kar saki
 Atanu Das is the only Indian archer in the men's individual event

 haalanki itihaas bataata he ki bhartiya team majboot tiimon ke khilaaf ahm maichon main apane nabz par kaabo nahin rakh paati he
 Due to which, despite giving tuff fight, the Indian archers have suffered defeat
 aise main rio main indian archars agar dhairya khone kii apni is kamazori ko khatm kar lete hai to padak hamaara hoga
 Challenging Indian Archers: It will be a big challenge for Indian archers to play in artificial lights in the Olympics
 bhartiya teerandaajon ko kritrim roshni main khilne kaa abhyaas nahin he
 Under such circumstances, if they find themselves shielded

 in donon olympix main mahila team quarter final tak pahunchane main safal rahi thi
 But no Indian archer has reached the quarter-finals so far in the individual event
 yahi vajah he ki bhartiya teerandaji sangh ne is baar ek maheene pehle hi bhartiya dal ko rio bhej diya
 So that they can adapt themselves well to the environment here
 bharat ke naam teerandaji main ab tak koi bhi olympic padak nahin he

 Confusion also increased due to the statement of the Congress spokesperson during that time

 This incident is of Sundarpada area falling under the Airfield Police limits in Rajdhani Bhubaneswar on Sunday night

 apane janmdin 15 janvari ko ab tak kii sabase badi raily karne ke baad bispi kii rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati shant nahin baithi
 Two days later, on January 17, he made a major change in the organizational structure of the party in UP and indicated that the BSP is desperate to overtake the poor performance in the four state assembly elections in December and threaten in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 pichley chunaavon ke kharaab nateezon se mayawati ko yah abhas ho gaya ki sanghathan ke upree padon par zyada logon kii niyukti ne party ke kader or matadaataaon ke bich bhram kii sthiti paidaa kii he
 To deal with this, after 2007, Mayawati made a major change to reduce the number of zonal coordinators from eight to three
 inke neeche ab har jile main chah prabhariyon kii team hogi
 It will have four Dalits, one Brahmin and one Muslim
 mayawati ne party main jila upaadhyaksh kaa pad khatm kar diya, lekin jin jilon main musalmaan yaa brahman in padon par the, ve apane pad par bane rahenge
 It is clear that Mayawati has given special consideration to Muslims and Brahmins after Dalits in reshaping bsp's organization
 bispi ke pradesh adhyaksh ram achal rajbhar kehete hai, ''bahujan ke saath sarvasamaj ke log teji se bispi se jud rahe hai
 The organization has been changed in the interest of everyone in the party
 ''upi ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bispi pehali party thi, jisane pichley saal farvari main hi sabhi loksabhaa siton par apane ummidavaar ghoshit kar kar die the
 After the Muzaffarnagar riots and the announcement of Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial candidate, the BSP has applied the mathematics of 'social engineering' in the Lok Sabha region-wise to counter the aggression with which the BJP and SP have started campaigning
 yahi vajah he ki party ab tak 80 loksabhaa pratyaashiyon main 30 ko badal chuki he
 It has 9 sitting mps
 (pradesh main yojit bispi kii brahman bhaichara raily kaa ek drishy)musalamaanon main sapa ke prati naaraazgi ko dekhte hue bispi ne sabase zyada 18 muslim ummidavaaron ko loksabhaa kii jang main utaara he
 Of this, 70 percent are from western districts
 mujffarnagar dange ke baad party ne pashchimi jile se aane vaale munkad ali kaa kad badhaate hue unhen paanch jilon kaa jonal koordinator banaaya he
 However, the BSP, which is trying to capitalize on the dissatisfaction of SP in its favor among Muslims, may be harmed for not taking the news of the affected area for four months after the Muzaffarnagar riots
 1 janvari ko swami prasad maury or nasimuddin siddiki ke netritv main danga peedit ilaakon kaa daura karne pahunche bispi netaaon ko kai jagah virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Leader of Opposition and State Spokesperson Swami Prasad Maurya says, "BSP leaders did not go to the riot-affected area earlier because it could have accused SP of spoiling the atmosphere
 '' lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main persian vibhaag ke purv vibhaagadhyaksh pro

" basharte party musalamaanon ko yah samajhane main kaamyaab ho jaae ki chunaav ke baad vah kisi bhi surat main bijepi se haath nahin milaaegi
 "last year, the BSP held a large number of Brahmin brotherhood rallies in the state
 abhi tak mayawati 21 brahmanon ko loksabhaa chunaav kaa tikat thama chuki hai, jo party ke bheetar kisi ek jati ke ummidavaaron kii sabase badi sankhya he
 Mayawati knows that for the better performance in the Lok Sabha elections, most of the 17 reserved seats in UP will have to be won
 surakshit siton ke liye is baar unhone dalit-obisi gathjod par daanv lagaaya he
 The BSP has fielded Jatavs in all 10 reserved seats in the West, Pasi in six seats in Central and Eastern UP and Kashyap fraternity in one seat
 bijepi, congress or sapa main parivaarwaad kaa virodh karne vaali mayawati ne apane mishan loksabhaa main isi ko apana hathiyaar bana liya he
 For example, Afzal Siddiqui, the son of the party's National General Secretary and Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Naseemuddin Siddiqui, from Fatehpur and the daughter of Swami Prasad Maurya, the State Spokesperson and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Dr

 Seema Upadhyay, wife of former minister Ramvir Upadhyay, will again contest from Fatehpur Sikri to become an MP, while on the other hand, the party has challenged BJP national president Rajnath Singh by giving Ramvir's MLC brother Mukul Upadhyay a ticket from Ghaziabad
 is baar booth str par bani bispi kii samitiyon main adhyaksh ek baar phir dalit ko hi banaaya gaya he, lekin inke sadasyon main agade or pichde varg ke logon ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya he
 Not only this, the number of Bahujan Volunteer Force (BVF) workers has been increased from 16,000 to 28,000 in the wake of the Lok Sabha elections
 force ke prabharee or party ke rashtriya mahasachiv nasimuddin siddiki bataate hai, ''2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan har vidhansabha kshetra main is force ke 40-40 kaaryakartaaon ko tainaat kiya gaya tha, lekin ab inaki sankhya badhaakar 70 kar di gai he
 "despite all these efforts, Mayawati's path in preparing for the Lok Sabha elections is not so easy
" badi sankhya main ummidavaaron ko badalane se bispi ke baagiyon kii suchi main lagaataar ijapha ho rahaa he
 a BSP candidate from Awadh region says that BSP candidates are currently campaigning in their areas for fear of ticket cuts
 sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa or cabinet mantri rajendra choudhary bataate hai, ''pichhali bispi sarkaar main hue bhrashtachar ke maamle saamne aane se janata ko mayawati kii karatuut kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 People will punish him in the Lok Sabha elections
 ''baharhaal vipakshiyon ke sabhi aaropon ko nazarandaaj karte hue mayawati bade hi gupachup tareeke se apni chaal chal rahi hai
 Seeing the failure of the SP government on different fronts as an opportunity, Mayawati is able to take advantage of it, this will determine the stature of the daughter of the Dalit in Delhi

 wo raaj jise daaud or pakistan sari duniya se chhipate rahe hai
 Where does David live and how many houses does he have
 uske makaan kitne aaleeshaan or hai security vaale hai
 First we are telling you that Dawood's whereabouts are the biggest secret for the world
 jaaniye daaud ne kahaan kaa pataa de rakhaa he or wo kahaan rahata he
 The fact that Dawood Ibrahim has been looking for the Government of India for many years, now every reality of his bases has been revealed
 bharat sarkaar ne pakistan ko jo dogier saunpa he, usamen anderworld don ke tamaam thikaanon ke bare main likhaa he
 However, no one knows where Dawood lives
 aapako bataate hai vah raaj, duniya main jiskaa sach yaa to pakistan sarkaar jaanati he yaa phir khud daaud
 An investigative report by a newspaper in our country explores Dawood's whereabouts
 jo bataati he kipakistan main kahaan-kahaan hai donke thikaane
 Dawood's first address was 6A, khayaban-e-tanjim, Phase 5, Defense Housing Area, Karachi

 Here, taking photos from mobile is also not allowed
 ye daaud kaa asli thikaana he
 Dawood's second address is 13, Block 4, Sector 5, Karachi Development Authority, Clifton, Karachi
 yahaan kai duutavaason ke daftar bane hai
 This is a high security area
 yahaan paak sarkaar or army ke afasaron ko bhi aasaani se ghar nahin miltaa
 In this house, a phone bill in the name of Mahajibin Sheikh was also revealed a few days ago
 daaud kaa teesraa pataa70, moin pales, abdulla shah gaji dargah ke paas, cliffton, karachi
 It is said that in this house, Dawood organized the ceremony of daughter's mehndi

 Dawood's sixth address F23, Block 5, Boat Basin, Clifton, Karachi
 10 july 1996 ko banaae gaye daaud ke passport par bhi yahi pataa likhaa he
 However, the address of this house turned out to be wrong
 daaud kaa saatvaan pataathvin manzil, mehraan squaire, paradesi house ke paas, 3 talwaar aria, cliffton, karachi
 When this address given in the dossier of the Government of India was examined, it was found that there is no building with this name

 That is, Dawood resides in many high security cells in Karachi city of Pakistan, but many of his addresses have also been given wrong
 shaayad wo duniya ko dhokhaa dene ke liye aisa kar rahaa he
 The shortage of water in the village Achanpur in Mahasamund district of Chhattisgarh leads to shortage of water

 In fact, as soon as the summer comes, the mercury of the villagers of Achanpur reaches the seventh sky
 ek to bhayankar garmi or duusari ore dur-dur tak pani kaa namonishaan nahin hota
 Thinking the same, the villagers of this area sometimes cursed the government and sometimes wept on their luck

 Mansi was also present in the school, she was aware of the problems in the village from her family to her school
 maanasi ne bade bujurgon kii har baat suni or phir skool se ghar chali aayi
 When Mansi reached school the next day, a letter was written in her copy

 Mansi showed this letter to her teacher and expressed her intention to take the letter to the Prime Minister
 shikshak ne maanasi ke is khat ko badi gambhirtha se liya or phir pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa pataa khoja gaya
 During this time, from teachers to Mansi's sister and her cousin also became active to deliver this letter to the Prime Minister
 preshit patr ko piemo kii site par aplod karaayaa gaya
 Nearly two weeks later this happened in the village, which no one had imagined

 a day before Jalabhishek, large crowds of devotees gather in Shiva temples
 shivaratri ke saath hi bhaktagan bhagwaan shiv ko jalabhishek karne lagate hai
 It is believed that on this day, Ravana offered one of his heads at the feet of Lord Bholenath, so it is believed that Lord Shiva is pleased by doing Jalabhishek on this day
 dilli or ensiaar ke shiv mandiron main raat se hi baari taadaad main bholenath ke bhakt jalabhishek kar rahe hai
 This sequence will last all day
 gajiabad ke dudheshwar mandir main to lakhon bhakt bhagwaan shiv kaa gangaajal se jalabhishek kar chuke hai

 america kii western kentki uniwarsity ke computer scince program main isi saal daakhila lene vaale kam se kam 25 bhartiya chaatro ko duusare skulon main daakhila lene yaa bharat laut jane ke liye kaha gaya he, kyonki ve uniwarsity ke daakhila maanakon par khare nahin utarate
 This news is published by the New York Times on Tuesday, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently in the US
 uniwarsity ne isi saal janvari main antarrashtriya recruitaron kii madad se 60 chaatro ko program main daakhila diya tha
 James Gary, president of the Computer Science Program at Western Kentucky University, told the newspaper that 'about 40' students did not meet their entry standards, while the university also provided them with help
 akhbaar ke mutabik, kul 60 main se lagbhag 35 chaatro kaa daakhila barkaraar rahegaa, jabaki 25 ko har haal main janaa hi hoga
 According to Gary, retaining these students in the program would be like making one mistake after another, because they cannot write even computer programs, which are a very important part of their curriculum, and are taught to graduates in the US
 in chaatro ko nikaale jane kii zarurat ke bare main gairi ne kaha, "agar ve yahaan se nikalne ke baad bhi program likhane ke kaabil nahin hue, to yah mere vibhaag ke liye sharmindagi kaa bis banegaa
 
 
 " in chaatro kaa daakhila bharat main ek pravesh abhiyaan chalaakar kiya gaya tha, jiske tahat recruitaron ne vigyapanon main 'spot admician' tathaa fees main chhot kii peshkash bhi di thim
 The university's Senate has now approved a proposal, raising concerns about the recruitment campaign, and in a statement said that they have now changed the recruitment process in India
 ab se uniwarsity ke computer scince vibhaag ke sadsy bhi bharat jaaenge, taaki pravesh ko manjuuri die jane se pehle ve chaatro se mil saken
 The comments udhar, uniwarsity main indian student association ke adhyaksh aditya sharma ne in chaatro ko lekar chintaa vyakt kii he
 Aditya, a student of Public Health Administration said, “I feel very bad for these students
 
 
 ve yahaan tak pahunche, or unhone kaaphi paisa bhi lagaaya
 
 
 " lekin aditya ne sweekaar kiya ki kuch chaatro ne apni padhai ke prati 'dhulmul' ravaiya apanaaya
 According to Aditya, "those students could not even achieve grade point average, so the university had to do this crop
 
 
 " With the help of international recruiters, the university had enrolled 60 students in the program in January this year
 western kentki uniwarsity ke computer scince program ke adhyaksh james gairi ne samachaarpatr ko bataaya ki 'lagbhag 40' chaatr unke pravesh maanakon par khare nahin utre the, jabaki uniwarsity kii ore se unhen madad bhi uplabdh karai gai thi
 According to the newspaper, out of a total of 60, about 35 students will remain enrolled, while 25 will have to go
 gairi ke anusaar, in chaatro ko program main banaae rakhana ek galati ke baad duusari galati karne jaisaa hoga, kyonki ve computer program tak nahin likh sakate, jo unke paathyakram kaa behad zaruri hissaa he, or america main snaatakon ko sikhaaya jaataa he
 Regarding the need for these students to be fired, Gary said, "if they are not able to write the program even after they leave, then it would be a shame for my department
 
 
 " The admission of these students was done through an entry campaign in India, under which recruiters also offered 'spot admission' and fee waiver in advertisements
 uniwarsity kii seenet ne ab ek prastaav kaa anumodan kar diya he, jisamen recruitment abhiyaan ko lekar chintaa jataai gai he, or iske alaava ek bayaan main kaha gaya he ki ab unhone bharat main jari recruitment prakriya main badlaav kar diya he
 From now on, members of the University's Computer Science Department will also go to India, so that they can meet the students before admission is approved
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Aditya Sharma, president of the Indian Student Association at the university has expressed concern about these students
 public health administration ke chaatr aditya ne kaha, "mujhe in chaatro ke liye bahut bura lag rahaa he
 
 
 They reached here, and they also invested a lot of money
 
 
 " But Aditya admitted that some students adopted a 'wavering' attitude towards their studies
 aditya ke anusaar, "ve chaatr grad point everej bhi hasil nahin kar paae, isliye uniwarsity ko yah fasala karnaa padaa

 mamata ke is daawey par biferi congress ne isse pehle yah kehete hue mamata ke bayaan ko kharij kiya tha ki sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa karegi
 After the Congress rejected Mamata's claim, Trinamool MP Derek o'brien tweeted, "I want to clarify that only half the truth in this case has been made news
" mujhe khushi hogi ki samprag sarkaar apana kaarykaal puraa kare

 Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi said, "I have not seen Banerjee's statement, but one thing is clear that the UPA government will complete its second term and elections will be held on schedule (in 2014)"
 madhyavadhi chunaav kaa koi prashn nahin he

 vahiin, supreme court main 37wein din bhi ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid maamle kii sunwaayee jari rahi
 On Friday, Senior Advocate Rajiv Dhawan started his arguments on behalf of the Muslim side
 is dauraan justise bobade ne poocha ki kya islam main devatv ko kisi vastu par thopa jaataa he? is par muslim paksh ne kaha ki donon dharmon main aisa hi hota he, islam main masjid iskaa udhaaharan he
 Justice Bobde said that we always hear that there is nothing like this, you worship Allah and not anything
 ham dekhnaa chaahate hai ki kya kisi sanstha ne masjid ko poojya mana he, kyonki sirf allaah ko puuje jane kii baat aati he
 Meanwhile, Senior Advocate Rajiv Dhawan said that the Hindu parties accused Babar of breaking the temple and building a mosque, but Babur was not a destroyer
 masjid to mir baaki ne ek sufi ke kehane par banaai thi
 During this time he read that 'hindus consider Nazi Ahle look upon Rama's existence, imam-e-hind
 ’vahiin, maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan justise chandrachud ne poocha ki kya is baat kaa koi saboot he ki babar ne babari masjid ko koi imadad di ho? is par rajeev dhawan ne kisi bhi tarah ke saboot hone kii baat se inkaar kar diya
 Also said that the evidence of the temple claimants is also not there
 masjid par hamale ke baad muslimon ko mila tha muaavjah rajeev dhavanasinior edwocket rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki 1855 main ek nihang vahaan aayaa or usne vahaan guru govind singh kii puja kii or nishaan laga diya tha
 However, everything was removed later
 british governor general or faizabad ke dipti kamishnar ne bhi pehle babar ke farmaan ke mutabik masjid ke rakrakhaav ke liye rent free gaanv die the or phir rajasav vaale gaanv die the
 Due to financial support, the other side's adversity position could not be achieved
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki saal 1934 main masjid par hamale ke baad nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye muslimon ko muaavja bhi diya gaya
 On 10 December 1884, a Bairagi Fakir entered the mosque building and sat down
 jab prashasan kii chetavanee ke baavjood vah baahar nahin niklaa, to usko jabaran nikaala gaya tha or uskaa lagaaya jhanda bhi ukhada gaya tha
 What happened in the 36th day hearing? On Thursday, the Hindu party made its arguments in the Supreme Court
 guuruuvaar ko pehle ramalala ke vakil kii ore se paksh rakhaa gaya, phir nirmohi akhaada or baad main gopal singh vishaarad kii ore se paksh rakhaa gaya
 Advocate Sushil Jain started the debate on behalf of Nirmohi Akhara
 unhone court se kaha ki ab ye sunwaayee 20-20 jaisi ho gai he
 The court resented his comment
 saath hi kaha ki aapako saadhe chaar din die
 Now you have to answer, so now you are saying 20-20? So was your last debate a test match? varsh 1983 main vishwacap dilaane vaale bharat ke purv cricket captain kapil dev kaa maananaa he ki aagaamee vishwa cap main bhartiya team kaa majboot paksh uski ballebaaji hogi, lekin agar bharat ko 28 saal baad is cricket mahakumbh main is baar khitaab hasil karnaa he, to toss ke samay mahendra singh dhoni ko bhagya kii bhi jarurat hogi
 Kapil said in the interview, "batting is our strength and i believe we should rely on it
 kai baar bhagya bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 It is very important to win the toss in every match
 agar ham toss haarate hai or vipakshi team hamaare liye 300 yaa isse adhik ran kaa vishaal lakshya detii he, to kaaphi mushkil ho jaayegaa
 "if we bat first and score 300 or more runs, our bowlers can complete the remaining work to win every match," he said
 ’’zyaadaatar logon ne vishwacap kii bhartiya team ko santulit bataane ke saath adad olerounder kii kami par chintaa vyakt kii he, lekin kapil ne kaha ki wicketiper ballebaaj ke taur par dhoni us jagah ko thik tarah se bhar denge
 He said, "there is no such thing as the wicketkeeper is also considered an all-rounder
" team main olerounder ke taur par hamaare paas dhoni he
 Hope he does well to create history and help India win the World Cup
 vaise aankade is baat ke gavaah hai ki kisi mejabaan ne ab tak vishwacap nahin jeeta he
 Regarding India's prospects in the World Cup starting on February 19 in the subcontinent, Kapil said, "on paper, India is without doubt one of the strongest contenders
" hamaari team main kai match vijeta khilaadi hai, lekin kshetrarakshan or viketon ke bich daud par shaq he, kyonki team main kuch kamjor kadiyaan hai
 Overall the team's batting is very strong, which can get you in a better position
 ’’kapil ne kaha ki dhoni kaa asaadhaaran netritv team kii majbootee he
 He said, "the captain is an important person in the team and it is a pleasure for us
" agar vah chalaa jaye to uskaa sthaan lene vaala koi nahin hota
 "there has been a lot of criticism about the selection of three spinners in the team but Kapil does not agree with this
" unhone kaha, ‘‘kuch parttime gendbaajon ke saath team main bas ek atirikt spinner he or antim ekadash kaa chunaav captain ke nazariye par nirbhar karata he
 "when asked whether the pressure of playing on home ground can cause problems for the team, Kapil said," i want to say that it works both ways
 logon kii aashaaen bahut zyada hai or kai baar ummiden kaaphi zyada ho jaati hai
 The advantage is that audience support is going to help you
 vaise nirbhar karata he ki team ke khilaadi ise kaise lete hai
 Kapil refused to comment on whether the team would miss him after South African outgoing coach Gary Kirsten departed after the World Cup
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main nahin jaanata kyonki main team ke saath nahin hum or main jawaab nahin de saktaa ki team ke pradarshan par coach kaa kya asar padaa
 For the past nine or ten years, some foreign coaches have been consistent with the team
 ’’kapil ne kaha, ‘‘main in baton se chitint nahin hota kyonki yah puri tarah se bhartiya cricket board kaa kaam he
 Asked what advice he would give to India to win the World Cup, Kapil said, "I don't think myself worthy of mentoring, but they should enjoy their game and play hard cricket
" ’’apane 1983 vishwacap khitaab ko yaad karte hue kapil ne kaha ki kisi ne cap jeetne kii kii ummid nahin kii thi lekin har match ke saath vishwaas badhata gaya
 He said, "nobody had any hope because no member of the team and team management thought about our victory
 vishwacap ke kiye swadesh se jate samay hamane kabhi aisa nahin sochaa tha
 Kapil said, "we didn't set any goals for ourselves, but we focused on winning every league match
 ham sabase pehle apane sabhi lig match or iske baad sabhi nokout match jeetna chaahate the
 When we reached the final, everyone was celebrating and we decided to give our best
 team ke ekajute prayaas se ham khitaab hasil karne main safal rahe
 '' congress netaa sandip dikshit ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki chunaav ayog ek dantaheen nikaay he
 He said that the Commission could not take any action on the complaints
 purvi dilli se congress pratyaashee dikshit ne kaha, 'chunaav ayog keval do-teen dantaheen chetavanee jari karata he or isse zyada kuch nahin kar paata
 The Congress on Tuesday lodged a complaint in the Election Commission against Ramdev and the founder of Art of Living, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, and said that these people were carrying out political activity
 unhone chunaav ayog se donon logon ke prachaar sambandhi muddon par najar rakhane ke liye kaha he
 The Congress leader told reporters that he had seen SMS in which Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has urged people to join his spiritual program to be held in East Delhi on Wednesday night
 isamen 'bhaajapa pratyaashee mahesh giri ke liye samarthan' maanga jayega
 Dixit accused Giri of using the spiritual program as a promotional tool
 dilli main 10 april ko vot daale jaaenge
 Traditions change over time
 isamen kuch bura bhi nahin he, lekin baat tab khalati he jab majaburi main sadiyon puraani parampara ko badalanaa padataa he
 Something similar is happening in Uttar Pradesh's Mainpuri district
 jameen kaa jalastr girane kii vajah se kuen suukh rahe hai
 Hundreds of wells have also been finished
 aise main majaburi main log shaadi kii jo rasm pehle kuen par nibhaate the ab hand pump par manaane ko majaboor hai
 The way of compelling such traditions also changed
 jin rasmon ke bina pehle shaadiyaan nahin hoti thim aaj unamem majaburi kii kasak dikh rahi he
 The helplessness is of drought, the helplessness is the shortage of water
 mainpuri main rivaaj ye hi ki ghar se baraat nikalne se pehle duulhe kii maa pair kuen main lataka kar baithti he
 To show that he needs a daughter-in-law
 rasmon ke mutabik kuen par hi maa bete se vachan leti he ki betaa uske liye bahu lekar aayega
 This tradition has been going on for a long time, without this ritual of mother, the procession would not go away in this area
 bahu ke ghar main kadam rakhane ke baad bhi sabase pehle kuen kii puja hoti thi
 The son came home after getting married and went around the well with his wife to complete the ritual
 ab alam ye he ki is ilaake main kuen suukh gaye hai, jo kuen kabhi pani se labalab hote the aaj unamem ek boond pani nahin he
 Thousands of wells have been covered since then
 unki jagah ab handpump ne le lee he
 The well is finished, but the rituals do not end, and that too, on occasions such as wedding marriages, every ritual is performed vigorously
 aise main kuen kii kami hui to rasm adaayagi kaa tarika badal gaya
 The water tank and hand pump have now replaced the well in wedding ceremonies
 kai gharon main to sirf ek chota sa drum rakh kar hi kaam chalaa liya jaataa he
 Difficulties of customs have to be faced only once in life
 shaadi hui, jaise taise rasm adaa kar die gaye, sari chintaa khatm lekin un mushkilon kaa kya jo inhen ta umr jhelni hogi or wo musiibat he pani kii killat kii
 Drying of wells means that the water level in the earth is rapidly decreasing in this area and this is the crisis of this area
 kabhi is ilaake main tees hajaar kuen hote the, aabaadi badhane ke saath hi unki taadaat ghatati gayi or ab gine chune hi kuen rah gaye hai
 The concern is not only that the water crisis is increasing in the area, but it is a matter of concern that there is no attempt to deal with this problem
 sarkaar is ilaake ke do block ko dark jone ghoshit kar apana kaam puraa hue samaj rahi he
 a river also flows from nearby, but its water is so dirty that it cannot be used
 manaregaa ke tahat talab kii khudaai hoti he, kuch talab sirf kaagajon par hai or jo kuch khude hai wo sookhe pade hai
 Perhaps the government is also waiting when it becomes a habit of difficult people

 Often Google pays tribute to a great person by making a doodle on his birthday or death anniversary, but today Google has made a doodle on Mahadevi Varma for some other reason

 Arvind is involved in a battle with the media as well as the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi
 kul milakar kejariwal ne ek saath kai staron par morcha khol rakhaa hai
 Here now the question arises whether Arvind's opponents who accuse him of being a dictator, have the power
 ajeeb baat he ki arvind yaheen nahin rukate vah media kaa public trial chaahate hai
 If this is so, what is the need of the Chief Minister of Delhi, what is the need of an elected government, even after such a strong majority in Delhi, the behavior of the Aam Aadmi Party is beyond comprehension, is it their nature to do politics of protest
 yahi aam aadmi party ne shuruyaat main bhartiya raajnneeti ko ek nai disha dene kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha
 The comments thik usee tarah jaise ek ummid kii kiran dikhi thi janata party ke samay or phir veepi singh ke vakt bhi, magar donon prayog vifal ho gaye
 Now the matter is of the Aam Aadmi Party, before the freezing process of the party has started, will the common man also have the same fate, or say that the Aam Aadmi Party will have to learn politics now, because by making allegations only at one time The Aam Aadmi Party seeking resignation is busy defending its own Delhi minister Jitendra Tomar, as the party feels that it is not right to suffer another setback
 matlab saaf he janata chaahati he ki unke kaam hon, arvind kejariwal ne kisaanon kii barbaad hui fasalon ke liye muaavje kaa elaan kar diya, magar kisaanon ke nuksaan kaa survey tak nahin kiya, yani logon kaa kejariwal sarkaar ke saath honeymoon khatm ho gaya he or yahi kejariwal sarkaar kii asli pariksha he

 Just as a ray of hope was seen during the Janata Party and again during VP Singh, but both experiments failed
 ab baat aam aadmi party kii he, jamane ke pehle party main vikharaav kii prakriya shuru ho gai he to kya aam aadmi kaa bhi vahi hshr hoga, yaa yah kahen ki aam aadmi party ko abhi raajnneeti seekhni padegi, kyonki ek vakt main keval aarope lagaakar istipha maangane vaali aam aadmi party apane hi dilli ke mantri jitendra tomars kaa bachaav karne main juty he, kyonki party ko lagata he ki ek or jhatka abhi jhelana thik nahin he
 It is clear that the public wants their work done, Arvind Kejriwal announced compensation for farmers' wasted crops, but did not even survey the loss of farmers, that is, people's honeymoon with Kejriwal government is over and This is the real test of Kejriwal government

 duniya kii sabase badi software company microsoft mobile ke bijness main fail ho gai
 The company officially released Windows 8
 1 mobile oes kaa saport band karne kaa elaan kar diya
 Despite many efforts, what happened that caused the company to decide to end it
 aaie jaanane kii koshish karte hai
 Microsoft now Windows 8 in Windows smartphones
 1 kaa apadet nahin degaa
 This was the biggest update ever delivered to Windows Mobile
 apadet band hone kaa matlab ye he ki ab Windows kaa khaatmaa ho rahaa he
 Due to lack of support, it will now be difficult for millions of Windows smartphone users
 haalanki yah achaanak nahin hua he, balki dhire dhire windos smartphone kaa khaatmaa hota aayaa he
 One opponent is over
 isse kuch samay pehle tak bazaar main teen smartphone kii tulana kii jaati thi
 Because Blackberry has already been cleared from the market
 isliye android, ioes or windos phone ko compair kiya jaataa tha
 But now after Android support is closed, only Android and ios are the main OS left
 kab hui Windows smartphone kii shuruyatsaat saal pehle yani 2010 main sabase pehlesthindots smartphone kii shuruyaat hui
 After this, Microsoft took license to manufacture Nokia brand of smartphones
 haalanki iske baavjood bhi windos phone bazaar main dhamal nahin machaa paae
 According to the report, by the end of 2016, the market share of Windows Phone worldwide was just 1 percent
 ek agency ke mutabik lagbhag 80 fisadi Windows phone main abhi bhi Windows 7, Windows 8 or Windows 8
 There are 1 mobile OS
 yani sirf 20 fisadi smartfones main hi Windows 10 mobile oparating system diya gaya he
 Significantly Windows 8
 1 mobile oes ko company ne teen saal pehle diya tha
 Along with this, Microsoft also updated Cortana
 iske alaava isamen kai graphical badlaav kiye gaye the
 Windows 8 by Microsoft
 1 mobile oes ke saath Windows phone ko android se takkar lene ke liye apni puri shakti laga di
 But due to many reasons, it failed to compete with Android and ios and finally now the company had to end its support
 market share girane or android ke mukaable fail hone kii vajah se microsoft ne apane lumia brands ke hardware segment ko bhi band kar diya
 Why Windows Smartphone failed Windows 8
 1 mobile oes ke saath sabase badi mushkil ye hui ki zyaadaatar bade ap developers ne iske liye ap relies karne se bhi manaa kar diya
 In this case, app support was reduced and users started dropping it
 udhaaharan ke taur par google ne apane kai oficial eps ko Windows Phone ke liye relies hi nahin kiya
 Even with some versions of Windows, whatsapp also ended its support
 itnaa hi nahinmicrosoft kii profeshnal soshal network linkd in ap ko pichley maheene windos store se hataa liya
 Apart from these reasons, there are many such lapses on the strategic front 
 philhal un yugers ko saport miltaa rahegaa jisamen Windows 10 mobile oes he
 But it is also not clear whether it will get support or not
 haal hi main company ne creatre apadet main kai nae fitures die hai, lekin sawaal ye he ki ab Windows mobile kaa kya hoga? Ever since the incarcerated Muslim leader of western UP Rashid Masood was imprisoned, the party has been renewed to establish its place among Muslims

 There was also a secret in them
 ek-duusare kii tarif bhi kii
 Digvijay Singh is considered to be the policy-maker of the Congress in minority affairs, hence its political significance is being extracted
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main moulana taukari raja ne congress kaa samarthan kiya tha lekin baad main ve naaraaz ho gaye the
 The Congress is once again seeking the support of Maulana ahead of the Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki moulana taukari raja ne sapa ko loksabhaa chunaav ke liye samarthan de rahe hai
 For this, they have put many demands before the state government
 kuch par kaarywahi ho chuki he or kuch abhi lambit he
 Many times Maulana has expressed displeasure over the government's attitude and warned to return to his red light
 vah kah chuke hai ki sapa ko samarthan keval upi tak hi simit he or keval modi kaa dar dikhaakar hi muslimon kaa samarthan nahin batora ja saktaa
 In order to cash in on the resentment created by the Muslims against the SP after the Muzaffarnagar riots, the Congress has put forward senior leaders to repair their relationship with Maulana

 grih mantri rajnath singh ne bijepi mukhyalay main patrakaron se kaha ki manishankar ayyar ne jo kaha he vah ek website par lekh main kaha he, us par congress kaa kya kahana he? unhone poocha ki ayyar ke bayaan par congress ko kya kahana he? chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan bhashaa maryaada ke ulanghan par ek sawaal ke jawaab main singh ne kaha ki yah ruknaa chahie, ise roka janaa chahie kyonki kisi bhi jimmedaar netaa ko is prakaar kii baaten nahin kerani chahie
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said in his tweet that the 'chief of abusers (abusers in chief)' returned to justify his 'lowly' remarks of 2017
 unhone kaha, ‘ayyar ne tab apni kharaab hindi kaa bahaanaa banaakar maafee maangi thi
 Now they are saying that their assessment was correct
 congress ne pichley saal unke nilamban ko waapas le liya tha
 The Congress's double character and arrogance again surfaced
 ’grahamantri rajnath singh ne pradhanmantri modi ke khilaaf amaryadit bhashaa bolne ke liye vipakshi partiyon par nishaanaa saadhaa or congress se manishankar ayyar kii ore se modi ke khilaaf 'neech' shabd kaa istemaal karne ko sahi tehraane par pratikriya maangi
 He said, what does the Congress have to say on Iyer's attempt to justify his statement
 gauratlab he ki kai maheenon tak chuppi saadhe rahane ke baad congress netaa manishankar ayyar mangalvaar ko ek baar phir surkhiyon main aa gaye jab unhone apane ek lekh main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf ‘neech’ shabd ke prayog ko uchit tehraaya or sabase kharaab bhashaa prayog karne vaala pradhanmantri bataaya
 In his article, Iyer criticized Modi on several issues and said that remember how i interpreted him on 7 December 2017
 kya meraa akalan sahi nahin tha? 2017 main purv kendriya mantri ne modi ko ‘neech aadmi’ sambodhit kiya tha jiske baad unhen congress party se nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 Iyer's statement is from 2017
 un dinon gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav tha
 Modi had tried to capitalize on Iyer's statement in election rallies by saying that he was called 'low caste'
 ayyar kaa kahana he ki vah aaj bhi apane us bayaan par kaayam hai
 There has been a backlash from the BJP after his statement
 pichley dinon congress ke netaa sam pitroda ne sikh virdohi dangon ko lekar ek bayaan main kaha tha, 'hua to hua
 Pitroda apologized after the criticism
