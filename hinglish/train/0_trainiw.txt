 We must now create a new intellectual movement

 Over the past year, intellectuals have been shaken by the saffron brigade over issues such as Rohit Vemula, Kanhaiya episode in JNU and the award comeback

 On this, some big family controllers came to the Haryana Bhavan near Mandi House in Delhi on March 22 for deep meditation

 The bottom line came out: "this is happening due to lack of influence in education, ngos and English media
" hamen bauddhik str par dakhal dekar nitigat rup se apana samooh khadaa karnaa hoga
 "and the people of the cadre-based organization have the responsibility of raising their cadre in the field of intellectuals, too

 It would be interesting to know that Arjunram Meghwal, MP from Bikaner, spoke very effectively in similar meetings, which played an important role in making him a minister

 Bhimrao tried to prove Ambedkar's thinking as that of Hindu nationalist leaders
 ambedkar ke buddha dharm apnaane ko unhone ghar ke ek kamare se duusare kamare main jane jaisaa bataaya
 The bjp-sangh, which is constantly on the backfoot about the Dalit issue, explained to the authors that if they remove their names from many of Ambedkar's quotes, then only Maharishi's views would be considered
 sangh parivaar main bechaini darasal is vidambnaa se upaj rahi he ki rajnatik-saamaajik kshetra main uskaa prabhaav he par bauddhik kshetra main ekadam akaal
 In the words of a leader who was involved in the meeting held in Haryana Bhavan, "in the 2004-2009 general election, the BJP has been taking 20-22 per cent of the votes even in the losing situation

 We have to work to change such interpretations of media and intellectual class
 ''vampanthi kii kaat taiyaar karenge sanghathansthaayee sarkaar hone kaa phayda uthaate hue sangh parivaar isi ranneeti par teji se aage baduya chahta he
 So, such forums are being set up which may be autonomous but be carriers of right wing ideology

 More than a dozen such organizations are currently active in various fields, which are called 'nationalist ideas' in the Union's terminology
 seminaron, prakashnon, soshal media aadi ke madhyam se ye vampanth se mukaable ko nae buddhijivi khadey kar rahe hai (dekhen graphic)
 The 2014 victory suggests that the bjp's 2014 election victory has in fact played an important role in the Sangh Parivar's strategy of building a system of thinkers

 Listen to him, "the manner in which the Sangh and its ideology were tried to be marginalized in India's intellectual discourse, defeating it with fact and logic is an important dimension of today's discourse
 '' bataate hai, sangh ke hosbale, suresh soni or akhil bhartiya prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya bhi anaupchaarik rup se foundation se jude hue hai
 For the first time, the Sangh has also assumed the responsibility of coordination among all such organizations

 Contradiction of ideas: Sangh Parivar officials who are accusing the biographers and biases of the media, sometimes seem to be adopting the same attitude towards such people
 bijepi upaadhyaksh or peepiarsi ke nideshak vinay sahasrabuddhe kehete hai, ''pashchim main bhartiya sabhyataa-samskruti par research kaa fishan ho gaya he, lekin bharat kaa bauddhik vaataavaran or shodh jo vastunishth rahanaa chahie tha, vahaan raajnneeti haaavee he

 Sinha has written a play with the same name on Emperor Ashoka

 For this, Sinha also had to take recourse to alleged left-wing historian Romila Thapar, in the role which he has also mentioned
 yah mahaj sanyog nahin he ki saarvajanik sandarbh main istemaal hone vaale mile ke pathar maane jane vaale saare shodhakartaaon ko sangh parivaar ke log vampanthi qaraar de dete hai
 Sahasrabuddhe still feels that there is an atmosphere of ideological untouchability towards the Sangh in the country and students of Sangh ideology do not get good guides or they are not given good numbers
 samay se peeche, ekangi sochbauddhikon kii jamaat main kamatar mahasoos kar rahe sangh kii samasya vamapanthiyon se zyada vah khud he
 Political analyst Yogendra Yadav says, "bjp-sangh is in the 25-30 year old world from today when the Left was dominated by academics
 doosraa sach yah he ki sangh kii sankeern or nakaaratmak soch kii vajah se desh ke shreshth buddhijivi bhagava daag se mukt rahanaa chaahate hai
 Despite being in power and having many revisions to distribute, only third class intellectuals are joining them

 Anand Kumar, however, welcomes the initiative of the Sangh Parivar to develop its intellectual base
 lekin ve aagaah bhi karte hai ki purna satya ke bajaae agar chote or adhure tathyon kaa sahaara liya gaya to bauddhikta kaa unka kadam taatkaalik hi sabit hoga
 The Kanhaiya episode, which is troubling the intellectual community, which has stood up on February 9, was taking shape in JNU, on the same day, the Deendayal Katha was going on the death anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyaya on the lines of the story of Satya Narayan in Deendayal Research Institute: Pragat Kripaala Deendayala

 One incident related to the openness of ideas is related to Amit Shah itself
 upi ke saansadon ke saath ek meeting main saansad lallu singh ne vidhansabha ummidavaar jald utaarne kaa suzav diya, to shah ne lagbhag dapatate hue kaha, ''tum apane kshetra ke naam do, abhi elaan kar dete hai

 The Sangh Parivar needs research on the Left itself before preparing its thinkers
 vamapanthiyon main bipin chandra jaise buddhijivi shuru se aakhir tak academik rahe
 But the right wing, which the union calls nationalism, does not see such a situation
 sangh-bijepi ko is baat par aatmachintan kii jarurat he ki usne 'shakhaaen' to khub failaayin par bauddhik jagat main jaden kyon na jamaa sake? The Supreme Court has ordered that all theaters in the country have to play the national anthem before the film starts
 lekin haridwar ke ek cinemaghar ne aisa nahin kiya
 According to local media, India's hockey player Vandana Kataria went to see the film with the family in the movie hall of a mall in Haridwar
 lekin cinemaghar ne film shuru hone se pehle raashtragan nahin bajaayaa jisase naaraaz hokar wo movie haul se baahar aa gayi
 The national anthem did not play in the theater and came out of the picture hall and asked why the national anthem did not play
 is par management ne kaha ki abhi tak isasmbandhmen unhen koi soochna nahin mili he
 Vandana has recently returned from Australia playing the Hockey Test Series
 is tour se gharwapasane ke baad unhone shahrukh khan-aalia bhatta kii 'dear jindagi' film dekhne gayi thi
 But due to non-playing of the national anthem, he had to return without watching the film

 In such a situation, take special care of these things that will make your first day in college your Best Day: Dress Up Well: Take special care of your dress on the first day of college
 kisi se milane par aapkaa pehla impressant hameshaa aapkaa pahanava hota he
 While going to college, keep in mind that in the circle of showing yourself different from others, your look may not get spoiled
 travel root kaa dhyaan rakhen:ghar se pehle din college jane ke dauraan aane-jane kaa rasta thik tarah se pataa kar len
 Also, calculate the time taken for commuting
 aisa karne se pehle din time se college pahunch jaaegein auraapaki class bhi miss nahin hogi
 Meet the seniors: When you reach college, the thing that is most afraid in your mind is ragging

 Avoid this type of behavior and talk to your seniors because seniors are the most helpful in case of a problem in college

 Do not rush around with the list of questions: On the first day, many students often meet such people who keep asking only questions to every third person they meet

 Always avoid early detection of all things on the first day

 ro pade amar singh, bole- shridevi kabhi nahin mar saktinkyon laga itnaa vakt?shridevi ke postmortem kii prakriya ravivaar kii dopaher se shuru hui thi
 Due to the holiday, there were not many doctors present in the hospital
 puure maamle kii police dwaara chaanbin ke baad postmortem shuru hua
 But it took so long that the chief doctor had gone due to the end of the working hour
 iske baad anya doctors kii team ne shridevi kii jaanchen kii
 Since this was a high profile case, the doctors paid close attention to all investigations
 dubai main postmortem kaa ek puraa protocol follow kiya jaataa he
 If an unnatural death occurred outside the hospital, the post mortem process and examination takes 2 to 3 days
 postmortem kii prakriya puri hone ke baad sari reports police kaa saunpi jaati he, iske aadhaar par police aage kii karrwai karti he or sambandhiton ko poochtacha ke liye bulaati he
 Boney Kapoor's statement was also recorded in Sridevi's case

 shridevi kaa antim sanskaar juhu sthit pawan hans muktidhaam main kiya jayega
 Constant rains and landslides in Uttarakhand have caused havoc all around
 jagah-jagah pahaad darkane kaa silsilaa jari he or iskaa sabase bura asar chaar dham yatra par pad rahaa he,kedarnathjane kaa rasta avaruddha hone ke baad abbadrinathka rasta bhi 3 dinon se band he
 Due to which the number of devotees has decreased significantly
 kedarnath kaa haal jaanane ke baad ajtak kii team badrinaath dham pahunchi, jahaan pichley 3 dino se baari bhuskhalan kii vajah se desh ke alag alag rajyon se aae tirthayatri behad pareshaan hai or teen din se sadak par hi apana samay gujaarne ke liye majaboor hai
 Now the only walking path is left between the forest and the mountains, the thin trail on which it is difficult to tell when the foot slips
 'ajtak' kii team ne jab samooche rajmarg kaa muyna kiya to paaya ki joshimath se neeche utarate hi puri sadak dhans chuki he or jo bachi he usame mashiinon se chhed kar lohe kii salaakhon se baadhane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 So that the remaining road can be saved from breaking
 gauratlab he ki kuch dinon pehle jo badrinaath yatra sucharu rup se chal rahi thi, us par bhi ab bhuskhalan ne roak laga di he, pichley teen dinon se badrinaath dham ke lamabgad main pahari se jabardast bhuskhalan ho rahaa he
 Due to which the route has been closed for the last three days and devotees are stranded on both sides
 yatriyon ko ek vaikalpik maarg se janaa pad rahaa he
 This route is built over the hills of Lambagad, which is taking more than 4 hours to cross
 is raste ke chadhaai or phislan bhare hone ke baavjood shraddhalu jaan jokhim main daalkar in raasto ko paar kar rahe hai
 However, faith is seen growing on all these troubles and many people are going to see Lord Badrinath from the foot of the hill
 lamabgad main bhuskhalan se pichley teen dinon se sadak ke donon taraf vaahanon kii qatari lagi hui he
 This hill of Lambagad has been cracked many times before, but due to heavy rains at this time, the landslide increased more from the middle of the hill
 jisase badri vishaal kaa darshan karne main bhakton ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 In such a situation, if there is more rain, this landslide can take a more formidable form
 vaigyanikon ne aise smart glaces (chashma) viksit kiye hai jinke lens taral aadhaarit hai or unka lacheelaapan har us vastu par focus karne main madad karegaa jise bhi glaces pahanane vaala vyakti dekh rahaa hoga
 These glasses, developed by researchers at the University of Utah, were developed in such a way that they would act like a natural pupil of the eye, that is, they would be able to focus on whatever the person is looking at, whether the object is far or near
 
 umr badhane ke saath hamaari ankhon ke lens kadak hote jate hai or vibhinn duuri par focus karne kii apni kshamta or lacheelaapan kho dete hai
 Therefore, glasses need to be installed
 lekin tab mushkil or bad jaati he jab ham vibhinn duuri par focus karne kii kshamta kho dete hai or aisi sthiti main hamen alag-alag duuri par dekhne ke liye vibhinn lainson kii jarurat padati he
 The comments nae viksit chashmon main glissrin se bane lens hote hai jinhen do lacheelee jhilliyon ke bich rakhaa jaataa he
 These lenses are mounted in the frame
 ye jhilliyaan focus milaane ke liye mud jaati hai
 The same lens can function as a multiplicity due to the flexibility and flexibility of the lens
 yah shodh optics express jarnal main prakashit hua
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) With aging our lens lenses become tighter and lose their ability and flexibility to focus at different distances
 isliye chashma lagane kii jarurat padati he
 But it gets more difficult when we lose the ability to focus at different distances and in such a situation we need different lenses to see at different distances
 tippaniyan The newly developed glasses have a lens made of glycerin which is placed between two flexible membranes
 in lenson ko frem main laga diya jaataa he
 These membranes turn to add focus
 lens kaa lacheelaapan or mudane kii kshamta ke chalate ek hi lens bahulence kaa kaam kar saktaa he
 This research was published in the journal Optics Express

 ) lahali jate hue aisa lag rahaa tha jaise ham kisi meley main ja rahe hon
 Off the village with brick houses there were tall white trees on both sides of the highway
 sadak se thodi duuri par rail kii patari dikhaai de rahi thi
 Lots of sugarcane and paddy fields were spread all around the glittering stadium of Lahli
 yah mela sirf ek bhagwaan ke darshan ke liye laga tha—stadium ke baahar vishaal hording laga tha, jis par likhaa tha, “cricket ke bhagwaan sachin tendulkar” kaa swaagat he
 There were different routes to get a glimpse of that God
 darshan ke liye koi tikat nahin rakhaa gaya tha
 Darshanarthi could go to the sarpanch, DC, SP, DSP or any cricket administrator to go inside the stadium, or request Malhotra ji, who sold his fields to build the stadium
 agar in logon kii krupa se koi vanchit rah gaya to vah stadium ke baahar ek stall par parchi par apana naam or phone number is ummid par chhod saktaa tha ki shaayad upar vaale bhagwaan kii inayat ho jaae
 We were a variety of people among the pilgrims
 kuch param bhakt the, kuch samay gujaarne ke liye vahaan aane vaale log the, kuch hulladbaj the, kuch parkhi the, kuch ashankit tirthayatri the to kuch naastik
 The crowd gathered for Sachin's darshan include youth from Lahli and Rohtak, wrestlers from Bhiwani, mother of a woman cricketer from Haryana, journalists from Chandigarh, Kolkata and Mumbai, 300 personal security personnel from Delhi, and at least 1,400 policemen
 
 ham logon main sabase bada bhakt 33 saal kaa tha
 He remembered each of Sachin's words
 aap usase kisi bhi test ke bare main puuchhen, vah ek second main aapako bataa degaa ki vah test kahaan khelaa gaya tha, kiske khilaaf khelaa gaya tha or uske bhagwaan ne kitne ran banaae the
 Ajit Singh Tanwar was a daily mechanic
 vah rajasthan main sikar jile ke dabla gaanv se aayaa tha
 He had brought a letter with him, in which he had informed Sachin about himself
 isamen sachin kii prashansa main ek kavita bhi thi
 He wanted to give this letter to Sachin
 maine sochaa ki main mumbai nahin, balki lahali jaaoongaa, kyonki mumbai main kisi bhavy shaadi jaisaa maahaul, netaaon or mashhoor hastiyon kii bheed-bhaad, tikat kota kaa naatak, mehmaan team kaa vishisht tarah kaa swaagat vagairah bahut bojhil ho jayega
 Writing a report on Sachin for the last time was exactly the same experience for me as the experience of writing a report for the first time
 main 12 saal pehle bandra (purv) main middle inakam group club main subah ke samay net par practice vaale dinon kii baat soch rahaa hum
 i went there to see how this genius plays on the net
 kya jeniyas ekant main practice karnaa pasand karata he?“aalaa kaa (vah aa gaya kya)?” club ke sadasyon ne vahaan khadey guard se dhime se poocha
 And then they started avoiding going to the pool or gym so that they could see it while going through the verandah
 tendulkar ne paanch gendbaajon ke khilaaf ek ghante tak ballebaaji kii, unhone net ke peeche 20 minute tak apane cover drive kaa abhyaas kiya, or unke strokes kii aawaaj subah ke samay kaanon ko sukhad ehsaas de rahi thi
 In between, he used to get advice from his partner Atul Ranade and his brother Ajit
 get par khadey hokar jo log unhen dekh rahe the, unamem photographer, autograph lene vaale or bachche shaamil the
 There was a small boy among us, who was looking at Sachin with his bright eyes eagerly
 maine us ladke ke abhibhavak se poocha, “kya yah cricket kheltaa he?”unhone muskaraakar jawaab diya, “yahi to ek cheez he, jisase yah pyaar karata he
 
 
 Actually she is from Latur
 vah dimag ke tumor ke oparation ke liye mumbai aayaa he
 He is staying in a nearby hospital and watches cricket all day
 use kisi ne bataa diya ki sachin yahaan practice ke liye aate hai, isliye sachin ko dekhne ke liye mujhe yahaan le aayaa
 ”sports journalists and their editors are often biased
 sielaar james ne jab likhaa ki ‘west indies main test maichon ke darshak apane saath puraa ek ateet or bhavishya kii ummiden bhi lekar aate hai“ to unhone ek tarah se lekhakon kii puri ek peedi ko disha de di
 Other sports writers value its craft and offer their opinions different from the world
 lekin khushkismati se ham sachin kii ballebaaji ko unke vaastavik rup main hi dekhte hai
 Indeed, we see Sachin as Master Blaster Sachin
 apane aakhri gharelu match main sachin apana balla lekar us samay maidan main utarate hai, jab pehle chaar ghante main 12 wicket gir chuke hai
 They move amid heavy noises and applause
 photographer unki photo lene ke liye aapas main dhingamushti karte hai
 This accolade for Sachin has never faded and never faded
 haa, ek hariyaanvi shaayad unase zyada prabhavit nahin he, jo unhen dekhakar tippanee karata he, dhai foot kaa dikhataa he ye
 Sachin's stature also matters to him
 lekin sachin kaa kad bhale hi chota ho, unka aakaar vishaal he
 The pitch is fantastic
 hamen bataaya gaya ki lahali main pani kaa str itnaa upar he ki pich kii ghaas kabhi khatm nahin hoti he, yah har match ke baad or bhi hari ho jaati he
 Cars parked temporarily in the parking lot in the fields sink into the ground
 maidan main hariyaali pasri he
 Fast bowlers have silver
 tivi waalon ko apane liye cement kaa ek platform bananaa padaa he, jisase ki ve 40 foot kii oonchai se sachin ke sir par hi na aa giren
 Sachin takes his well-known stroke and the ball goes across the boundary line running on the field
 kuch der baad hi ve out ho jate hai
 The ball scatter the wickets touching his bat
 ve pichley do saal se isi tarah kii gend par out ho rahe hai
 Within twenty minutes of their dismissal, chickpeas and sugarcane juice disappear from the farms selling them
 6,000 logon kii bheed chant jaati he
 And only the shadow of the Ranji Trophy match remains there
 isse pataa chalata he ki tendulkar kya hai or cricket main ve kya myne rakhte hai
 They have come to the Pavilion and everyone is thinking what they are thinking
 ek baar maine unhen apane saathi se yah kehete hue suna tha, “agar meri ballebaaji kaa din acha rahata he to meraa din bhi acha rahata he
 "but there is really no question of a good or bad day
 sachin ke jivan main har din sachin kaa din he
 After the game, he returns in a white 5 Series BMW car sent from Delhi
 ek qaraar ke mutabik ve saarvajanik maukon par kisi duusare brands kii car main safar nahin kar sakate
 Some boys ride on their bikes and gallop with their cars and take pictures of them from the car window
 sachin darate hai ki kahin koi sadak durghatana na ho jaae, isliye ve apane driver se gaadi dhire chalaane ke liye kehete hai
 They are often very careful about people's passions
 canal rest house ke get par pehle se hi baari bheed unka intjaar kar rahi he
 Here he is stationed with four 'senior' players from Mumbai
 kuch rasookh vaale log suraksha ghere ko todakar andar maujuud hai
 The number of these people is around 100
 ve sachin se haath milaanaa chaahate hai, unki photo kheenchna chaahate hai, unka autograph lenaa chaahate hai, apane bacchon ko milwaanaa chaahate hai or kuch unhen bahut kareeb se dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Sachin fulfills everyone's wish
 unke vidaai daure kii documentary banane waalon ne mujhe yah baat bataai
 They wanted Sachin to give them enough time
 sachin ne hi unhen film banane kii manjuuri di he
 a team of six people has come from Delhi's ITC Maurya, which prepares food for them at the rest house: if there is any such thing as food poisoning in their food, what will be the result can be guessed
 subah or shaam ko ek baar ve mithi lassi pite hai
 The people of the press are very interested in their food habits
 sachin ko rohtak kii mithi lassi bahut pasand aati he
 Ajit Singh Tanwar is also among those who get a chance to meet Sachin in the evening on the second day
 ve sachin ko apana ek patr dete hai
 In return he got a vest signed with Sachin and a lot of love together
 sachin ne unki pariksha ke liye unase test number 130, 80 or 155 ke bare main poocha to ajit ne bina deree kiye sahi-sahi jawaab de diya (130wein test main england ke khilaaf 130 ran naabad banaae the or yah 26 / 11 ke baad khelaa gaya tha
 )
 maine ajit singh se poocha, “dravid kya sachin ke baraabar nahin hai?” unhen bhadakaane ke liye yah kaaphi tha
 i learned this thing from the book If Cricket is a Religion, Sachin is God
 unhone tadaak se jawaab diya, “breadman bhi sachin kaa muqabla nahin kar sakate
 Bradman's average look against the West Indies: 74
 5
 "sachin's average is not against anyone
 ”sikar ke is sachin bhakt ne mujhe chup kara diya, “bangladesh ke khilaaf sachin kaa ausat 136
 Is 66
 ”jaldi hi ajit ko lekar tivi patrakaron main jang chhid jaati he
 a channel earned him Rs 50,000
 par anubandhit kar liya he
 This is Sachin's charisma
 cricket puri tarah anischitataaon kaa khel he, koi nahin jaanata isamen kab kya ho jayega
 Nothing is fixed
 breadman apane vidaai test match main ovel ke maidan par shunya par out ho gaye the
 Five months later, in a first-class match, a crowd of 94,000 gathered to bid him farewell at the MCG, with only 52,000 on Saturday wanting to see him score another century
 iske baad kuch maheenon tak ve doston ke liye bheed jutaney kii khatir khelte rahe
 During a match in Adelaide the toss was fixed so that Bradman could field on Saturday
 is baat kaa khulaasa lambey samay baad ho sakaa
 But due to changing the situation of the game, he had to come to the ground on Friday evening and he was soon dismissed for 30 on Saturday the next day
 takhne main moch aa gai or ve maidan se chale gaye
 This was Bradman's last match of the first class
 pakistan ke khilaaf sunil gavaskar ne apni aakhri pari main ukhdati pich par 96 ran banaae the
 Still India was defeated
 unhone pratham shrenee ke apane aakhri match main lodrs main emsisi ke khilaaf rest of da valrd kii ore se 188 ranon kaa ambara khadaa kar diya tha
 He was dismissed for zero in the second innings by Malcolm Marshall
 1987 main unhone apni aakhri antarrashtriya pari valrd cap semifinal main england ke khilaaf kheli thi
 He was dismissed by just 4 runs and India had to face defeat
 vivian richdrs ne breadman kii tarah ovel ke hi maidan par aakhri test khelte hue 60 ran banaae the, lekin 17 saal main pehali baar west indies england ke khilaaf siries nahin jeet pai
 After two seasons, he played his last match for Glamorgan in Canterbury
 yah match sande lig tital ke liye tha
 There young bowler Kent troubled him a lot
 ek tej gend unki chaati tak ai, ve use hook nahin kar sake or gend lapak lee gai
 But she was a no-ball
 unhone apane yogadan se glamorgan ko jeet dilaai thi
 Sachin is not batting despite being cheaply dismissed in Lahli
 kinhin bhi myanon main ve richdrs se alag nahin hai
 He is struggling to gain weight in the lower part of his body and is still dealing with it
 ve khelte samay do baar apni taangon ko edjust karte hai
 First at the corner of the crease and second before taking the stance
 ve sir bhi itnaa hilaane lage hai ki unke helmet ke gir jane kaa dar lagata he
 Even in the midst of wickets, they show the same speed on the chance
 agar ve yah dekh len ki fielder khatra paidaa kar saktaa he to ve kuch-kuch chitah jaise or kuch-kuch rantunga jaise bhaagate hai
 There is no lightness in his body language
 stroke lagane main bhi kisi tarah kii laaparvaahee kii jhalak nahin dikhaai detii he, jo sachmuch bahut mahatvapurn baat he
 Yes there is a chance when they let themselves loose a bit, and that is a slow bouncer
 is par ve jarur chook jate hai or samay se pehle hi apana balla chalaa dete hai
 They are delayed in making the upper-cut and the ball goes out
 ve thodaa sharminda najar aate hai
 He hesitates to play a spinner on the front foot
 tej uthati gendon par balla lagane se bachate hai
 This is a good strategy for the pitch
 tendulkar bhi jaanate hai ki unki teji main thodi-bahut kami ai he, jaisaa un par najar rakhane vaale kaaphi samay se andeh karte rahe hai
 Nevertheless, they are intact, with full force in their place
 mumbai ke coach sulakshan kulkarni bataate hai ki baaki khilaadi ritairement kii ghoshnaa ke baad khel ke maamle main deele pad jate hai lekin sachin ne aisa nahin kiya
 Sulakshan has played in his first Ranji match with Sachin
 sachin net par abhyaas ke liye usee lagan ke saath aate rahe, jaise pehali baar abhyaas ke liye aae the
 They practice the net five times as before
 unhone mumbai main apane team ke yuva saathiyon se kaha, “cricket ke saath eemaandaar raho
 This was the lesson that Achrekar Sir taught him, which he always remembered
 sachin ab bhi krij par hai
 They bat in the spirit of practicing their religion
 ve har tarah ke shot khel rahe hai, kabhi glans karte hai to kabhi doosraa shot lagaate hai
 In this way they win in a good match
 jeetne par ve hawa main bhujaaen laharaate hai
 Soon they start appearing in thousands of photos — with the team, with the administrators, with the groundsmen, with the sweepers, with the police and the photographers themselves (in the stands where Sachin is not there, Sudhir Gautam of Muzaffarpur is Defeat Kami, who comes by writing his name on the whole body)
 dressing room main mumbai kii team kuch der ke liye jashn manaati he
 Kulkarni says, "I told the boys that we should give Sachin a farewell gift by winning the match
 lekin sachin ne apni behtareen pari khelkar khud hi hamen tohfa de diya
 After this, Sachin spent an hour in the changing room of Haryana, where he kept talking with the youth team
 unamem se ek yuva khilaadi rana ne apana naam pramod se badalakar sachin rakh liya
 The ODI player in the country is wearing a T-shirt named Sachin under his jersey
 haal hi main ek test khilaadi ne plaster of paris par sachin paaji kii dahini hatheli ke nishaan ko apane nae ghar main tonga he
 All these cricketers are pilgrims and this is their Vishwakarma Puja, just as artisans worship the deity of craftsmen
 unke liye sachin ke myne bahut hi swaabhaavik hai, unhen ise samajhane kii katai jarurat nahin he
 Journalists are contemplating their great innings for Mumbai: a brilliant century in Ranji's first match in 1988, a stunning 96 in the final in 1991, 233 not out in the semi-finals in 2000
 main vyaktigat rup se us pari ko yaad kar rahaa hum, jisamen unhone mumbai kii ore se australia ke khilaaf 204 ran banaae the or out nahin hue the
 The innings he played in two seasons was truly amazing, in which he spread all the colors of the batting
 unka handwork, footwork sab kuch itnaa shandaar tha ki aaj bhi vah pari man ko romanchit karti rahati he
 Whenever we remember that innings, then we start riding on the jholes of the past and diving into the sweet memories
 koun-sa stadium tha vah? breaborn, or saal? 1998
 Sachin may say goodbye to cricket, but in our hearts always, the words will continue to resonate, "sachin
 
 
 sachin

 a few days ago, there were reports in US media that China is working in Pakistan by making secret plans to make fighter jets and other military hardware
 jiske baad pakistan kii taraf se safai di gai ki sipiisi ek economic project he or iske koi military diemension nahin he

 In the Himachal Assembly elections, BJP has declared Prem Kumar Dhumal as the CM candidate at the last moment
 bijepi ke is elaan se party ke diggaj netaa or modi sarkaar main mantri je pi nadda ke samarthakon ko jhatka laga he
 In view of the manner in which PM Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have expressed confidence in Nadda for the last few years, this veteran was considered a natural contender for the post of CM in Himachal elections
 haalanki rajya ke jatigat samikarnon ko dekhen to dhumal ko lekar bijepi ke elaan main hairaan karne vaali koi baat nahin he
 Dhumal appears to be a much stronger candidate than Nadda in terms of caste equations
 himachal main rajput king mekarhimachal pradesh kii siyasat main rajput samudaay sabase ahm he
 The state has the highest number of Rajput voters at around 37 per cent
 18 fisadi brahman iske baad aate hai
 Prem Kumar Dhumal belongs to the Rajput community, while JP Nadda is a Brahmin
 is tarah dekha jaae to dhumal kaa vot bank nadda se dogune se bhi zyada he
 In such a situation, the BJP did not want to annoy the Rajputs by playing bets on the Brahmin
 vaise bhi congress kii ore se mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa virbhadra singh hai, jo rajput samudaay se hi hai
 In such a situation, Rajput voters were expected to join the Congress camp, due to which BJP President Amit Shah made Rajput leader Prem Kumar Dhumal the CM candidate just 10 days before voting
 modi kii pasand maane ja rahe the naddadhumal ke naam ke elaan se sabase zyada jhatka jepi nadda kheme ko laga he
 Considering the manner in which the BJP high command had been projecting Nadda in the state for the last two years and giving them responsibilities, the supporters of Nadda were considering their leader as a natural candidate for the post of CM
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii himachal main hone vaali reliyon kii jimmedaari khaastaur par jepi nadda ko di gayi
 But when the election mercury reached its full ebb, Dhumal was betted
 himachal kaa siyaasi samikarnhimachal pradesh main kul 68 vidhansabha site hai

 If we look at the votes polled in the 2012 assembly elections, the Congress got 43 percent and BJP 39 percent
 2007 kii tulana main congress kaa vot 5 fisadi badha jabaki bijepi ko 5 fisadi vot kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 The BJP lagged behind the Congress by just 4 per cent votes but got 10 seats less than the Congress
 supreme court main yachikakarta va bijepi netaa ashvini upaadhyaay kii ore se arji daakhil kar kaha gaya he ki riprogentation of pipul act (jan pratinidhitiv kanoon) kii dhara-33 (7) ke tahat praavdhaan he ki ek candidet do siton se chunaav lard saktaa he
 On the other hand, Section-70 says that if the candidate wins both seats after contesting from two seats, then he has to resign in one seat as he can retain only one seat
 The petitioner said that every citizen has a fundamental right That he should look at the candidate's record and see his merit and vote
 agar do jagah se candidet jeetta he to use ek seat chhodana hota he or us seat par dobaaraa chunaav hota he
 The re-election is a financial burden on the government

 is tarah dilli main lokapriyata ke maamle main modi or rahul main zyada bada faasla nahin dikhaa
 5 per cent of the participants in Delhi also voted for Arvind Kejriwal in favor of the Prime Minister
 survey main dilli ke logon ne naala / naalee / saaf-safai ko sabase bada mudda bataaya
 The big reason for this could also be because Delhi has an AAP government and the BJP is in control of all three mcds

 shastri ne kaha, lokapriyata ke myne hai ki aap sarkaar banaaen or satta main rahete hue lagaataar acha karke dikhaaen
 The important thing is that Arvind Kejriwal maintained his focus on what the needs of the people of the city are
 buniyadi dhaanche ko thik karnaa, swasthya sevaaon ko thik karnaa or bijli-pani kii dikkaton ko suljhaana
 The Aam Aadmi Party formed its government with a thumping majority in the 2015 elections to the 70-member Delhi Assembly
 is chunaav main aam aadmi party ko 67 siton par kamyaabi mili thi
 The BJP had to settle for only three seats

 badalon ko dfa kar chatkh ghaam nikal aayaa
 In the small courtyard of an old house, ten-twelve women are sitting in the shade of a neem tree
 kaale burke pahane zyaadaatar auraton ke haath main ek card or sau-paanch sau ru
 'S notes are visible
 phir un auraton ne ve saare paise apni group leader ko die or usne ve paise ginakar ek vyakti ko de die
 —in Patna Muradpur village of Hapur district of western Uttar Pradesh, these women are members of a group that has taken small loans for work from SVCL Microfinance Company
 paisa jamaa karne vaala vyakti company kaa field officer he
 30,000 for running a grocery shop by a woman
 kaa karj liya he, to kisi ne isliye karj liya he ki uskaa pati electrician kii dukaan chalaa sake
 It is a world of microfinance, where people take small loans, apart from big businessmen who run away from the country by sinking big loans and debts
 use kaam-dhandhe main lagaate hai
 Pay money on time and fill your happiness with lots of happiness
 lekin is duniya par bahari duniya kii najar nahin padati
 Patna will understand the changes in the lives of Muradpur's women with great care, but first of all understand that what is microfinance? If viewed in historical terms, Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh formulated a framework of providing small loans four decades ago keeping in mind the rural needs and social fabric of South Asia
 yah model itnaa kaamyaab rahaa ki 2006 main unhen iske liye shanti kaa nobel puraskaar diya gaya
 Since 2010, this experiment has also become faster in India than ever before
 yahaan microfinance companiyaan bhartiya rigerv bank kii nigaraanee main kaam karti hai or vanchit aay varg ke logon ko karj detii hai
 Most of these people do not even have a bank account
 na hi in logon ke paas girvee rakhane ke liye jaaydaad hoti he
 These 56 companies give loans to people (practically only women) through their branches and field officers spread across the country
 lone lene vaale ko company ko aashwast karnaa padataa he ki karj kis kaam ke liye liya gaya he
 About 3 in the country at the same business model
 5 karod log microfinance companiyon se karj le rahe hai
 This number is twice the total income tax payers of the country
 sirf pichley vitt varsh main in companiyon ne 60,000 karod ru
 Distributed debt over Rs
 desh kii vikaas dar bhale hi 7-8 fisadi kii ho lekin microfinance companiyon ke group lone portpholio main 2014-15 kii tulana main 2015-16 main record 84 fisadi kii vruddhi darj kii gai
 The most shocking thing is that there is not even one percent cases when the money of companies is sunk
 lekin kaarobaar shuru karne se pehle ye companiyaan logon ko yah kaise samajhaati hai ki ve chitfund company nahin hai, jo unka paisa lekar chanpat ho sakati hai? is sawaal kaa sidhaa jawaab sonata microfinance company ke emdi anup kumaar singh dete hai, ''emepha sirf karj de sakati hai, logon kaa paisa jamaa nahin kar saktin
 When people's money will not be deposited, then where is the question of running away
 ''to aakhir vah koun-sa model he, jahaan itani eemaandaaree se karj waapas chukaaya ja rahaa he, jabaki hajaar bandishen lagane vaale bainkon kaa non parforming asset (enpie) saat se aath fisadi tak pahunch jaataa he
 To solve this cliff, Ratna Viswanathan, CEO of Microfinance Institutions Network and Regulatory Microfinance Institutions Network, told India Today, "the important thing is to use social networks for better business rather than to create a long penal code
" goes
 '' darasal yahaan karj kisi ek mahila ko dene ke bajaae paanch, das yaa isse adhik mahilaon ke samooh ko diya jaataa he
 Members are told that if a woman does not repay the loan, the remaining women will have to pay her money
 karj vaapasi kaa zyada boj na pade, isliye har pakhwaade kist jamaa karai jaati he
 The loan is given from the company's branch, while the recovery is done by making the company's center in the village itself
 isse mahilaon ko company ke chakkar na lagane padate
 "here again the same question came to mind that if a woman refuses to pay the installment? Patna Muradpur's laughter turns back and asks, "if you have taken the money, don't you have to pay?" If you do not give, then how will you take the loan further? aise logon ko group main shaamil hi kyon karnaa jinaki niyat thik na ho
 "hansra has taken this loan for her husband's pottery shop in Hapur
" vahiin, parchun kii dukaan ke liye karj lene vaali shabnam kahati hai, ''ek to galat aurat ko group main shaamil hi nahin karte, duusari baat yah ki agar koi kist nahin chukaayegi to kya itane logon ke taane sunakar vah gaanv main izzat se rah sakegi
 35,000 for the shop of groceries
 kaa karj lene vaali rukhsana samajhaati hai, ''is karj se dukaan shuru kii
 So much money comes out that Rs 1,050
 maheene kii kist chukaa den or kuch paisa batch bhi jaae
 We would like to see more debt from the future
 '' darasal, microfinance main is baat kaa khaas dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki utana hi karj diya jaae, jitna karjadaar aasaani se waapas kar sake
 rbi's explicit orders that in no case a person can take loans from more than two companies
 ise sunishchit karne ke liye sari companiyon kaa data har 15 din main saajha or apadet kiya jaataa he
 The rate of interest in microfinance companies is up to a maximum of 26 per cent
 esavisiel ke siio rakesh dube kehete hai, ''microfinance company ko bank se hi 12 fisadi tak kii dar se karj miltaa he
 It is then given to the customer
 '' lekin yah dar to soodakhor mahajanon ke bhi kaan kaatane vaali lagati he? dube bataate hai, ''agar karj kii vasuuli saal ke ant main kii jaati to ek vyakti ko 10,000 ke lone ke evaj main 12,500 ru
 Had to give
 lekin har 15 din par kist bharne se vyavhaar main use 1,100-1,200 ru
 Only interest has to be paid
 aise main vyaavhaarik dar 12 fisadi hi baithti he
 "secondly, the operating cost in small loans increases compared to large loans
 zyada karj kaa yahi sawaal jab shyampur gaanv kii shakantula devi se kiya to unka jawaab tha, ''sabase badi suvidha to yah he ki hamen girvee kuch nahin rakhana padataa, jabaki pehle mahajan ke yahaan se karj lene main saamaan girvee rakhana hi padataa tha
 Mahajan's loan was to be repaid in full at the end of the year with full interest, while repaying the installment every fifteen days does not reveal much of the debt burden
 '' shakuntla ne bhens ke liye 35,000 ru
 Had taken a loan of unke pati ek kooparative ko doodh bechate hai
 Their demand is that the buffalo is now one lakh
 kii aati he, to unhen zyada karj diya jaae
 But what if someone in the house blows the debt owed to buffalo or starts doing something else? The 50-year-old Sudesh Sharma answers this, "the buffalo decides which buffalo to take, but we go ourselves to pay
" auraton ke haath main paisa aane se gharavaalon kii sharaab tak chhot gai he
 They now go on quietly selling milk
 bacchon kii fees kaa bhi paisa nikal aata he
 "in the economy of the village, if loans are being given for small shops or animal husbandry, then bicycles education has emerged as a new medium of loan in cities
 lakhanu kii bhartiya microcredit (biemasi) ke prabandh nideshak vijay pandey ne bataaya, ''hamane centre sarkaar kii mudra yojana ke saath microfinance ko jod diya
 One lakh loan for rickshaw from bank and Rs
 40,000
 tak lone emepha se kara diya
 "even though the rickshaw pullers are men, the loan is given only to women
 biemasi bihar main solar charkha pradaan karne ke liye bhi lone de rahi he
 This makes women Rs 300 a day
 kii dihadi kama leti hai
 Like this company, the rest of the companies are also distributing debt
 isi kaa asar he ki 99 fisadi log samay par paisa lautaa de rahe hai
 Such a large number of successful loans has two means - providing employment to the poor in their home and opening new doors for the microfinance companies in the rural and urban economy
 apatkaal ke dauraan subramanyam swami bade hero banakar ubhare the, vaise to unhone immergency se pehle hi indira gandhi ke khilaaf morcha khol diya tha
 Indira Gandhi, one of the most powerful Prime Ministers of India, during the 1970 budget debate, described Swamy as a surrealist Santa Claus
 swami dwaara rakhe gaye udaaravaadi aarthik nitiyon kii indira bahut badi virdohi thim
 In 1969, Swamy joined the Delhi IIT before the Emergency against Indira
 is dauraan unhone suzav diya ki bharat ko panchavarshiya yojanaon se dur rahanaa chahie or bahari sahaayta par nirbhar nahin rahanaa chahie
 According to him it was possible to achieve 10 percent growth rate
 swami kii yahi batenindirako nagavar gujri
 Following which, due to the displeasure of Indira Gandhi, Swamy lost his job at IIT Delhi in December 1972
 haalanki iske khilaaf swami adaalat gaye or 1991 main adaalat kaa faisla swami ke paksh main aayaa
 Not only this, Swami had given Indira the biggest baby during the Emergency
 jis vakt vipaksh ke netaa jelon main band the or jo baahar the unke thikaanon par dabish di ja rahi thi
 In the meantime, Swami returned to India from the US, broke the security cordon of Parliament, attended the Lok Sabha session on 10 August 1976, and also fled the country and returned to the US
 chakma dekar pahunche sansaddrasal apatkaal se pehle dow
 Swamy had a lot of contacts between the bureaucrats, so he had already come to know about the Emergency
 25 june 1975 ko swami or jaiprakash narayan ek saath ratribhojan kar rahe the, is dauraan swami ne jepi se kaha ki kuch bada hone vaala he to jepi ne unki baat par vishwaas nahin kiya or kaha ki indira gandhi aisi morrkhtaa nahin karengi
 But 4 right next morning
 30 baje unhen ek kol aayaa jisamen unhen police ne apratyaksh rup se bataaya ki wo swami ko pakadaney vaale hai
 After this Swami went underground for 6 months
 us samay jepi ne swami ko soochna bheji ki tum america chale jaao or vahaan apatkaal ke bare main logon ko jaagruk karo
 Dr
 Swamy then moved to America to become a professor at Harvard and started using the Harvard platform to sensitize Indians in 23 states of the United States about the Emergency
 hero banakar ubhare swamisubramanyam swami ne apatkaal ke dauraan sochaa ki logon main apatkaal ke khilaaf himmat jagaane ke liye wo ek din ke liye sansad main ghusenge or 2 minute kaa bhaashan dekar phir bhumigat ho jaaenge
 Swami wanted to prove that the entire country was not under the control of Indira Gandhi
 haalanki us samay swami ke naam se warrant bhi jari ho chukaa tha
 But still he went to the Parliament on the day of 10 August 1976 and left it in front of journalists abroad and country saying that democracy is dead in India
 uske baad swaminepal ke rastewapas america chal gaye
 This incident gave the people a new force and they became a hero during the Emergency
 swami aaj bhi kehete hai ki 'main sansad isliye gaya, taaki indira gandhi ko bataa sakuun ki wo sarvashaktimaan nahin hai, desh unki mutthi main nahin he, main sirf indira gandhi ko galat tehraana chahta tha or maine aisa kiya bhi
 'swami's words
 
 
 haalanki apatkaal ke dauraan america chalakar sansad tak pahunchnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Because the list of people who landed at Delhi airport was with the administration
 jisapar prashasan unhen pakadaney yaa chhodane kaa faisla karata tha
 Swamy reached Delhi via Bangkok to reach the Parliament, so the administration did not get the idea
 swami kii maane to dilli airport par utarate hi unhone rajyasabha kaa paas dikhaakar baahar nikal gaye
 The policemen posted at the airport thought that they were some young Congress leaders, and then reached Parliament
 jahaan unhone indira sarkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai or phir america chale gaye
 a three-day important meeting of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) will begin in Nagpur from Friday
 is baithak main sangh or usase jude sanghathanon ke 1500 pratinidhi shaamil honge
 BJP national president Amit Shah, BJP organization minister Ram Lal and BJP general secretary Ram Madhav will also be present at the meeting
 teen saal main hoti he sangh kii ye baithkwaise to har saal march ke duusare saptaah ke aakhir main pratinidhi sabha kii baithak hoti he
 But every third year this meeting takes place at the Union Headquarters Nagpur
 is baithak main sangh ke 3 varshon ke kaamkaaj kii reporting hoti he
 At the same time, the agenda and future action plan for the next three years is also decided
 bhaiyaji kii jagah aa sakate hai datratreya hosbolehar teen saal mennagpur main hone vaali baithak mensanghathan kii zarurat ke hisaab se sanghathanaatmak badlaav kiye jate hai
 a section in the Sangh wants that this time Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi should be given the responsibility of Sarkaryavah to Sahasrakaryavah Datratreya Hosbole
 lekin sangh main doosraa dhada chahta he ki bhaiyaji joshi ke paas hi sarkarywah zimmedaari rahane di jaae
 Last time in the House of Representatives, considering the health of Bhaiyaji Joshi, the discussion of getting the responsibility of Hosbole in his place was loud, but even then Bhaiyaji Joshi was elected unanimously by Sarkaryavah
 tab bhaiyaji joshi ne kaha tha ki pichley kai varshon se kah rahaa hum ki ab meri umr ho gai he
 Therefore, the younger generation should be brought forward
 10 march ko hoga sarkarywah kaa chunaavsutron kii maane tosang ke bade netaonka maananaa he ki ghutane ke oparation ke baad unka swasthya pehle se behatar he
 The final decision on Sarkaryavah will be held on 10 March
 lekin itnaa tay he ki sangh main sanghathanaatmak badlaav 2019 ke aam chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar kiye jaaenge
 These issues will be discussed in the meeting
 The way Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's interference in Ram temple case has increased in this meeting, it will also be discussed

 Somewhere inside the arches placed on the high-rounded pillars of the Supreme Court, a thin document has been kept - 'revaluation of Values in Judicial Life'
 yah 1997 main aayaa tha
 There are a total of 16 principles and criteria — a judge should not contest elections, should not be close to the bar, should not listen to family and friends, should not be involved in public debates, should not interact with the media, gifts or hospitality Should not be accepted, should not be influenced by business, shares or stocks or try to take financial advantage
 
 
 balki unhen alahada or alag-thalag rahanaa chahie, kyonki harek jaj lagaataar 'aam logon kii najar' main hota he
 The overall bottom line of being a judge is that "justice should not only be there but it should also be seen to happen
" '' ab ye panktiyaan kuch zyada hi gunjane lagi hai or puure desh kii najar usee ore lag gai he
 The crisis, which has no name, on January 12, when four of the country's most senior judges — Justices Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph — held press conferences and the Chief Justice of India (CJI) Deepak Mishra was in power and court
 Accused of misuse of conventions, the whole country was shocked
 chaar jajon ne conference main kam hi koi anmol baat ujagar kii, par ek chitthee main ek gaiyr-maamuli chetavanee jarur di—ki hindustan kii sabase oonchi adaalat main sab kuch 'sahi nahin' chal rahaa he or isse loktantr khatre main pad saktaa he
 The judges distributed a 'no-date' letter in which no substantive allegations of malpractices were leveled against the CJI, nor were any definitive verdicts criticized
 iske bajaae, isamen yah aarope lagaaya ki tamaam peethon ko—jo varishthata par bahut zyada jor detii hai—maamle saunpane main paaramparik prakriyaaon ko todakar pradhan nyaayadhish vah hone de rahe hai jise in chaar jajon ne 'sanstha kii eemaandaaree par sawaal' khadey hona kaha he
 For many, this was a 'welcome' step, while some were 'unacceptable'
 iske natijatan hue virodh pradarshnon ne desh ko do dhruvon main baant diya or dar or ummid donon ko badha diya
 Fear of the fact that judicial infighting and worrying allegations have come out in the open in front of everyone has hardly happened before
 or ummid yah ki isse nyaaypalika main aakhirkaar nae sudhaaron or kahin zyada paardarshita ke daravaaje khul jaaenge
 Acute debates have erupted across the country and accusations have started — who is right, who is wrong? They also have ideologies and parties on both ends
 isane hindustan ko ek bhare-puure sankat kii jad main dhakel diya he, kyonki samvidhan main is kism kii sthiti se nibatane ke liye na to kanoon hai or na paramparaayen
 All eyes are on what happens in the Supreme Court now — will there be a treaty or ceasefire and peace will begin? Will the upheaval and hard feelings persist? Will the black-robed brothers consult together and make sure that the legitimacy of the Supreme Court is not tainted? The world of the top-notch judges, surrounded by disenchanted and open-minded and power-ridden seldom illuminated She comes in ve fouran pahachaani ja sakane vaali media shakhsiyaten nahin hai, un tak aasaani se nahin pahunchaa ja saktaa

 "CJI Mishra did not make any statement
 lekin pichley november main jab bataur 45wein pradhan nyaayadhish unke chaar maheene ke kaarykaal main ek medical college ke rishwat ke maamle main aalaa jajon or tejatarraar janhit yachika vakeelon ke bich apratyaashit takaraar chhidi tab unhone adaalat main kaha tha, ''ye aarope is mahaan sanstha ko daagdar banane kii sajeesh ke tahat uchhaale ja rahe hai
 This has left the system under control and now everyone will doubt the Supreme Court, that too on a speculation basis
 isaki bharpai ham kaise karenge?''iskaa ek upaay prashaskeey sudhaar ho saktaa he
 CJI Mishra has to appoint 10 judges during his tenure
 supreme court main 31 jajon ke pad hai, lekin abhi 25 jaj hi hai
 The Narendra Modi government is sitting on the last document of the process of appointment of judges
 24 hycourt 672 jajon ke sahare chal rahe hai jabaki 407 jajon ke pad rikt hai
 But the Supreme Court record shows that the number of pending cases of CJI Mishra has decreased
 sitambar-aktubar 2017 main 2,174 maamle ghate hai
 During this period, it was also seen that more than 100 cases were disposed of in a single day in the CJI court and the court continued at 4 pm
 sarvocch adaalat main lambey vakt se khadbadata tanaav pehali baar pichley november main bhi khaulakar baahar aa gaya tha, jab sijei par medical college ghotaale se jude ek maamle main galat rukh apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha or jisamen hycourt ke purv jaj ko supreme court ke jaj ko rishwat kii peshkash karte bataaya gaya tha
 This was the case he himself was looking into
 haalanki unke upar rishwat lene kaa aarope nahin tha, par senior vakeelon ne baar-baar dakhal dene or maamle kii sunwaayee keval unke pasandida jajon ko hi karne dene ke liye sijei kii tikhi aalochana kii thi
 In the letter written to CJI Mishra, the four judges said, "there have been instances in which cases of far-reaching consequences for the country and the institution were selectively submitted by the Chief Justice of this court to the" Benches of his choice "
 , While there was no rational argument behind handing them over
 iske khilaaf har keemat par satarkta barti hi jaani chahie
 The judges' letter also mentions the Memorandum of Procedure (MOP), which was formed after the 2015 decision of NJAC

 iske saath hi supreme court ke nyaayadhishon or hycorton ke mukhya nyaayadhishon kii niyukti kii 'collegium pranali' ko sakriy ghoshit kar diya gaya tha
 In this two-part decision, the apex court had said that the central government would finalize the MOP in consultation with the CJI and other collegium members
 yah iskaa prabhavi hissaa tha, jisamen paardarshita kii baat kahi gai thi or yah bhi ki supreme court ke prastaavit kuch naamon ko sarkaar rashtriya suraksha kii bina par khaarij kar sakati he yaa nahin
 There were lengthy settlement negotiations and it was only after that that the collegium led by Justice Khehar finalized it
 sarkaar ko ise keval prakashit karnaa tha, magar usne aisa nahin kiya, jisase tamaam nyaayik niyuktiyaan thap pad gayi or isse adaalaton par mukademon ke boj or tanaav main or bhi ijapha ho gaya, jaisaa ki chaar jajon kii chitthee kahati he
 Explaining these two allegations, legal scholar Upendra Bakshi says, Chelameswar and three other brothers have adopted a constitutional convention that CJI cannot arbitrarily ignore seniority
 ve sawaal karte hai, ''kya sijei is paripati kaa virodh karenge?'' ek baar phir, sijei or collegium ne march 2017 main emopi ko antim rup diya tha or ise centre ko bhej diya gaya tha
 Four judges have said that you cannot keep such an important matter hanging — you must decide
 yaa phir collegium bulaaen or use tay karne den
 a lot of time has passed
 unhone samaran patr bhi bheje
 Bakshi says, "so this is the next step
 yah suzav diya gaya he ki agar emopi par aakhri faisla nahin liya jaataa he, to unhen sarkaar kii khamoshi ko uski sahmati maan lenaa chahie
 The government has been notified, the Supreme Court should now replace the MOP

 Since October 2016, Chelameswar is not sitting in the appointment of judges with four judges including CJI
 supreme court ke sutron kaa kahana he ki sijei ne collegium kii baithak main shirkat ke liye chelmeshwar ko patr likhaa magar unhone inkaar kar diya
 In fact, not attending the meetings of the collegium has become a trend

 Lodha says, "if the CJI and his fellow justices had sat together, the solution would have been found
 main pradhan nyaayadhish rahaa hum or main aapako bataata hum ki aapke saathi jaj aapke parivaar ke sadsy kii tarah hote hai
 If issues arise, they should be considered and resolved
 '' agar sarvocya adaalat ke jaj ek najire ke saath sanvaidhanik faisla de sakate hai to ye maamle kyon nahin hal kar sakate?vidhi centre for legal policy ke sansthaapak or research diarector aghrya sengupta kaa maananaa he ki press conference is prakriya kaa hi ek hissaa he
 He says, "when bad times come in marriage matters, you cannot suppress it
" aapako apane partner ke saath khulkar baat kerani hogi or hal nikaalnaa hota he
 "they say that whatever the circumstances have been with the four judges, it is a shame to become like four versus one
" samasya kii jad apaardarshita lagati he
 The CJI probably created such benches that the other four judges did not agree with
 is tarah ke aarope aksar lambey samay se sune jate rahe hai lekin nyaaypalika kaa kaamkaaj behad paardarshee mana jaataa he isliye kisi tarah kii baahar khabar nahin ho paati
 "now is the time for judicial reform in terms of administrative, procedural or rights," says Sengupta
 agar aisa upsanhaar hua to sakaaratmak hi kaha jayega
 According to Prashant Bhushan, a member of the Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Judicial Reformers (CJAR) and PIL advocate Prashant Bhushan, the issue raised by the four judges is straightforward
 ve kehete hai, ''chaar jajon ke hisaab se sijei roster tay karne vaale hai lekin unke paas manamaane tareeke se maamalon ko soochibaddh karne kaa adhikaar nahin he, khaskar samvedansheel maamalon ke sandarbh main

 "this issue should be resolved and clear rules should be made in the matter of sharing of cases and formation of bench
" taaki supreme court or nyaaypalika main logon kaa bharosa kaayam ho sake
 Till then it was suggested that a constitution bench of five senior-most judges be set up for all sensitive and important matters
 lekin in sabhi sudhaaron se ek sawaal judaa hua he ki kya sijei ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke kathith aaropon ke liye paryaapt saboot hai? maamalon ke bantwaare ke peeche yah andeh bhi he ki yah sab isliye kiya gaya taaki rajnatik partiyon kii shah par nateezon ko prabhavit kiya ja sake
 The issue is not just four versus one
 andeh yah bhi he ki sijei aise saathiyon par bharosa kar rahe hai jo bhrashtachar yaa dabaav kii jad main aa sakate hai
 Bakshi says, "such doubts may arise due to politics but i do not know that this doubt should be made in this controversy

 Nishikant's film 'drishyam' with Ajay Devgan is going to be released
 isi silsile main nishikant se baat kii hamaari team ne
 Let's know about this film of Nishikant
 film 'drishyam' kii neenv kaise padi?main hyderabad main kisi film kii shooting kar rahaa tha tabhi 'vycom' kii taraf se mujhe south main bani 'drishyam' kii dividi dekar unhone kaha ki ek baar aap ye film dekhiye
 i saw that film 8 days later
 film kaa screenple mujhe bahut pasand aayaa
 i had never made suspense thriller, so thought that i will definitely make this film
 ajay devgan kis tarah se film main aaye?'vycom' kii taraf se ajay devgan ko bhi is film ke bare main bataaya gaya tha or maine jab ajay ko phone kiya to unhone kaha kii 'chalo karte hai'
 He simply did not even listen to the script and the film started while drinking coffee
 aapane abhi tak is tarah kii film nahin banaai he?ji, maine 'dombivli fast' 'force' 'lay baari' jaisi filmein banane ke baad pehali baar suspence thriller banane kii koshish kii he
 i like to experiment
 aajkal cat-tu-cat filmein dekhnaa pasand kiya jaataa he, 'drishyam' kisi banaai gai he?yah lagbhag dhai ghante kii film he
 i am confident that the duration of the film will not affect much because if it is a bad film, then it looks small and big, and no matter how big a good film is, there is no boredom
 kya aap 100 -200 karod vaali filmon main yakeen rakhte hai?main kabhi bhi number game ke peeche nahin padaa
 i don't even go down that street
 mujhe filmein bananaa pasand he or vahi kaam karata hum
 The rest is the boss above
 film banane se pehle kya kabhi aap darshakon kii taraf se bhi sochate hai?main darshakon kii soch se hi filmein banaata hum
 8 of my films have done well at the box office
 shooting ke dauraan main hameshaa sochataa hum ki is pal darshak kya soch rahaa hoga
 i follow their thinking only
 aapaki jon ke saath duusari film ban rahi he, irfan ke saath duusari saath hi ritesh ke saath bhi aap duusari film banane vaale hai, kya ajay devgan ke saath bhi aapaki duusari film kii baatcheet chal rahi he?ajay se meri baat chal rahi he
 We are both waiting for a good subject
 aap 'force' kii sikval kar rahe hai?nahin , main 'force 2' nahin kar rahaa, meri problem bor ho janaa he kyonki mujhe subject ko ripet karnaa pasand nahin he
 i told John that i wanted to do something else
 to nayaa hi karnaa chahta hum
 Does Vishayam closely resemble the South Walli? No
 Only 60 percent is the same
 maine 40 pratishat kaa badlaav kiya he kyonki is film ko aap zyada ched nahin sakate
 The screenplay of the film is very good
 aapane film '404' main acting bhi kii thi, ab acting kaa man nahin karata?darasal acting kaa shauk mujhe hameshaa se rahaa he lekin vah kabhi junun nahin ban paaya
 i had also received acting offers but i refused, because i was busy shooting films and could not act at all
 aapako lagata he ki filmon kaa shrey diarector ko nahin balki actor ko diya jaataa he?dekhiye weekend par film dekhne mere naam se to koi nahin aayega, agar aapako lakhon logon ko theatre tak laana chaahate hai to star kaa hona jaruri he
 So it is perfectly right for the star to get credit
 main bhi bachapan se amitabh kaa bahut bada fain rahaa hum
 Whatever their films, i still like to watch the first show
 aisa koun sa actor he jise diarect karne kaa aapkaa sapana he?meraa ek hi sapana he, kii main ek dishmitabh bachchanako diarect karun
 He is the only actor who has a dream to direct me
 baaki meri koi bhi khwaahish nahin he
 If i do a film there is a lot
 aap jon ke saath 'rocky handsam' film kar rahe hai?ji'rocky handsam'ek ection film he
 In it, John tries to save a family and Full on is tremendous action
 film puri ho chuki he
 John is playing the role of 'rocky' in the film
 irfan khan ke saath 'madari' film kaa kya concept he?'madari'main ek bhi gaanaa nahin he, bahut hi thahari huyi film he,irfan khanki acting bharpoor dekhne ko milegi
 It is the story of a common man who fights with the issues of society
 tehraav vaali film he jaisi maine 'mumbai meri jaan' banaayi thi
 Explosion in Ara's civil court
 ek consteble or ek mahila kii maut
 The fire in that village of Muzaffarpur was not even cold that this news of the explosion had come
 yah he bihar kaa taaja haal
 Did people vote in Bihar for a similar situation? If not, then why such a situation? For some time, such incidents have started happening in Bihar which did not happen before
 yah sab loksabhaa chunaav ke thik pehle shuru hua or yah ab bihar kii niyati banate ja rahi he
 Before the Lok Sabha elections, the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi had gone to the Gandhi Maidan to hold a public meeting and during that time there was a bomb blast in his meeting
 phir vijaydashami ke din gandhi maidan main bhagdad machi or kai saare log maare gaye
 a few days ago a violent incident took place in a village in Muzaffarpur and the administration remained silent
 in sab ghatnaon kaa zikr isliye ki ye sari ghatnaayen prashasnic aakshamata ko darshaati hai
 Nitish Kumar came into Bihar politics as an expectation
 unke aane se logon main vishwaas paidaa hua tha, lekin unke satta se jane ke baad logon kaa bharosa prashasan par kam hua he
 Criminals have been fearless
 ghatnaayen bad rahi hai
 Even by giving assurance of action and investigation, the administration is not winning the trust of the people
 modi kii sabha main visphot ke peeche aatanki gut kaa haath tha lekin prashasan use kyon nahin bhaanp pai? vijaydashami ke samay jab gandhi maidan main bhagdad machi thi us samay bhi prashasnic laaparvaahee saamne ai thi
 The village of Muzaffarpur which was surrounded and burnt was also not abrupt
 hajaaron logon kaa hathiyaar samet ek jagah par bina kisi samvaad ke jamaa ho janaa sambhav nahin tha
 What was the local administration doing? What were the heads, sarpanches, mlas doing there? Will the investigation also include mobile conversations of all local administration officials including the MLA? There is no hope and this is the reason that people's trust is decreasing both on administration and governance
 haalanki in sabhi ghatnaon ke liye sirf prashasan ko doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Lack of administration means that the ruler is weak and it is clearly visible in Bihar
 roj-roj ke raajnneetik bayaan, kisi ke mukhyamantri bane rahane or hathaaye jane kii anischitata prashasan ko kamjor kar rahi he
 Criminals are taking advantage of this and creating an atmosphere of terror in the state
 janata ne nitish kumaar ko apane rajya ke mukhyamantri ke taur par dekha tha isliye unhen vot diya tha
 The public did not trust Nitish for the politics of the Center and this became clear in the elections
 phir nitish kumaar kaa mukhyamantri pad se palaayan kyon? sirf apane ahm kii santushti ke liye? nitish kumaar ne bihar kaa mukhyamantri kisi or ko bana diya jise janata ne nahin nitish kumaar ne chunaa tha
 People had faith in Nitish Kumar and they broke it
 aaj rajya main jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he uske liye kya nitish kumaar apni jimmedaari se batch sakate hai? jis prashasan par se logon kaa bharosa uth rahaa he, aparaadhiyon main khauf kam ho rahaa he, ghatnaayen bad rahi hai, un sabhi baton ke liye nishchit taur par nitish kumaar hi jimmedaar tehraae jaaenge
 By speaking of ideology, Nitish cannot cheat the people of the state
 modi sarkaar ne raajnneetik dalon kii fundig (political funding) vyavastha main sudhaar laane ke liye vaarshik bajet main kai ahm praavdhaan kiye hai
 Through the budget, the government has banned political parties from receiving cash donations above Rs 2000
 2000 rupee se adhik chanda check athwa digital tranjaction ke jariye lenaa anivaary karne ke saath¬-saath sabhi dalon ko inakam tex ritern bharne kii anivaaryta kar di he
 Apart from these provisions, an important announcement has been made and which was heard for the first time in political circles
 kendra sarkaar elactoral bond jari karne ja rahi he or iske liye vah rigerv bank ke niyamon main sanshodhan karne kii taiyaari main he
 After this announcement, everyone has a question in their mind: what are these electoral bonds? At the same time, will they be bought and sold on the lines of any general bond of the Reserve Bank and what will be the role of political parties in this buying horse
 kya hota he rigerv bank kaa bondkendriya rigerv bank desh main karency ke sanchaar or credit vyavastha ko regulate karata he
 To reduce the debt burden of the Finance Ministry, the Reserve Bank issues several types of bonds from time to time
 in bond ko 5 saal kii macurity period ke saath jari kiya jaataa he, haalanki macurity se pehle bhi in bonds ko market main bechakar nivesh kiye hue paise ko nikaala ja saktaa he
 These bonds issued by the Reserve Bank are only allowed to be purchased by Indian citizens and non-resident Indians
 kya he elactoral bondkendra sarkaar dwaara bajet main di gai simit jaankaree se sirf yah samajha ja saktaa he ki prastaavit elactoral bond kaa istemaal desh mempolitical fundigake liye kiya jayega
 3 players of electoral bond: This electoral bond will have three players
 pehla donor, jo raajnneetik dalon ko fund donnet karnaa chahta he
 It can be any person or organization or company
 doosraa, desh main rashtriya or kshetreey raajnneetik dal
 And the third country's Central Bank Reserve Bank of India
 ise bhi padhein: chunaav sudhaar or raajnneetik kamai par lagaam se rukegaa kalaadhan!duniya main pehali baar bharat main hoga jaripolitical fundig or raajnneeti main bhrashtachar par lagaam lagane ke uddeshy ke saath bharat pehla desh hoga jo is tarah kaa bond jari karegaa
 At the same time, in some countries the entire expenditure of political parties is borne by the government, so that corruption in political parties does not flourish
 is bond ke madad se raajnneetik dalon ko milane vaale blikemani ko puri tarah se white rakhane kii koshish kii jaaegi
 Some special features of electoral bonds - a notified bank will issue this bond
 - is bond ko sirf check athwa digital pement karke kharida ja sakegaa
 - The bond purchased by the donor will be given to the political parties for a fixed time under the scheme
 - raajnneetik dal apane notyphoid bank acount ke jariye in bond ko cash kara sakate hai
 For this bond, all political parties in the country will have to notify a bank account with the Election Commission, in which they can receive the money of this bond
 - yah elactoral bond ek berer check kii tarah hoga jisase bond ke jariye donneton dene waalon kaa naam gupt rakhaa ja sake

 ) The CBI today applied to a Delhi court and demanded the closure of the Bofors scam against Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi
 kwatrochi ke pratyrpan ke sabhi prayaas nakamamukhya metropolitan magistrate kaveri baweja ke samaksh daakhil yachika main sibiai ne kaha ki mukademe ke liye kwatrochi ke pratyrpan ke sabhi prayaas naakaam rahe hai
 The investigating agency opposed the plea of advocate Ajay Aggarwal, who had filed a petition to dismiss the report of privately closing the case
 sibiai ne is aadhaar par virodh kiya ki agarwal ko maamle main hastkshep kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The role of the court in deciding is limited
 Additional Solicitor General (ASG) p

 Malhotra said that the role of the court in deciding the application is limited and the cbi's plea can be dismissed only on the ground that it has been filed under parochial views and the investigating agency has not set its mind
 agasta westland helicopter ghotaalaa maamle main es pi tyaagi samet anya aropiyon kii jamaanat par court ne apana faisla surakshit rakh liya he
 The Patiala House Court will now deliver the verdict on 26 December
 court ne sibiai ko apane record dikhaane ke nirdesh die hai
 The court asked the CBI what evidence the investigating agency has on behalf of Tyagi to take money in the deal
 saath hi court ne poocha ki 2005 main jab helicopter kharid ke liye maandand badale gaye tab us meeting main kitni agenciyaan shaamil raheen
 The CBI, in its reply, said that the agency has evidence to take Tyagi's money and several assets were purchased when he was the Air Force chief
 iske alaava 2005 kii meeting main 4-5 agenciyaan shaamil thim lekin abhi unka khulaasa nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki isse jude sabhi log jaanch ke daayre main hai
 The CBI has strongly opposed the bail of former Air Force Chief SP Tyagi, accused in the Augusta scam case
 sibiai ne kaha ki yah ek badi or ahm jaanch he jisamen kai hai profile logon kii bhoomika kii jaanch jari he
 Therefore, if Tyagi is granted bail, then the investigation will be directly affected
 abhi tak kii jaanch main tyaagi ke khilaaf ahm saboot mili hai jinase ghotaale kii kadiyon ko jodne main madad milegi
 The CBI said in the court that the evidence of meeting the accused and proving their places in the case has been found
 jaanch ke bare main abhi zyada khulaasa nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki aisa karne par jaanch main shaamil aaropee anya logon ko pehle se hi satark kar denge or vah log ahm sabooton ko nasht kar sakate hai
 In its plea in the court, the CBI said that the investigating agency is not investigating the money trail, but it is investigating how the crime was carried out
 isamen koun-koun log shaamil the, sibiai vyavasthit dhang se maamle kii jaanch ko aage badha rahi he
 No one can be arrested in haste
 sibiai ne court main jaankaree di ki jaanch italy or aath deshon tak pahunchi he jisamen lakhon dastavej khangale ja rahe hai
 Seventy percent of the documents are in the Italian language which is being translated
 haalanki court ne poocha ki jaanch puri hone main kitna vakt lagegaa to sibiai kii ore se ASG tushaar mehta ne kaha ki vakt ke bare main abhi nahin bataaya ja saktaa
 The first day of Agenda Aaj Tak ended with Shah Rukh Khan's presence and film songs
 buudhvaar kaa aakhri seshan tha, 'gaala dinar bhaashan- shahrukh express'
 Anjana Om Kashyap, the anchor who talked to her till date
 baton hi baton main shahrukh ne kaha ki vah donon khan, yani salmaan or aamir ke saath kaam karne ko taiyaar hai, basharte bajet ho or sabake nakhre uthaane vaala diarector ho
 How Shahrukh made this conversation interesting with his sense of humor, read this conversation
 aapkaa dil sabase tej kab dhadkta he?shahrukh:meraa basic falsafa he jindagi kaa, 25 saal filmon main kaam karne ke baad
 a moment comes in life, in success, where there is no need for mind
 dil se jo baat nikalati he, wo zyada conect karti he
 a sure relationship is formed with the audience
 unhen yakeen hota he ki main do dhai ghante ke liye unhen mushkilon se dur le jaaoongaa
 Despite all this, i would say that there was pressure
 100 karod 200 karod kii baat chal rahi thi
 Everyone said it was over
 boodha ho gaya
 i said, i tell you, i am from Delhi, i like you
 jaise hariyaanvi main bolte hai, zyada choudhary na ban
 Well it is a matter of fun
 magar chelange to tha hi
 How Shahrukh Khan proposes
 
 
 ?shahrukh:main jo bhi mahila ho yaa ladki ho, mujhe jaisaa kehete hai, main vaise hi kar detaa hum
 Like you do in FM
 aap logon ne wo jo gaanaa tha, adnan sami kaa thodi si to lift kara de
 In the same way, i can lift anyone, though now its meanings have also changed
 audiyans arase se aapkaa intjaar kar rahi thi
 
 shahrukh:eemaandaaree se kahuun to aap aaj tak or india today vaale hameshaa hi hatakar kaam karte hai
 But here i come to make you laugh
 mujhe apana super star gutthi maniye
 
 
 In 'koffee with Karan', even Salman has accepted that no one is more romantic than Shahrukh
 shahrukh:wo jo kehete hai, sach kehete hai, uske sivaa koi nahin
 i do not think of myself as such, but Salman Khan has said so, it must have been right
 
 
 shahrukh khan ke energy level kaa raaj kya he, kitne ghante sote hai aap, aaj clear kar dijie
 
 
 Shahrukh: i only sleep for 5 hours
 agar isamen kuch gadabad hoti he to susti rahati he
 Now that i have come out of life it is a duty to give advice to the youth
 aap ye do-chaar chijen na karen
 Eating, sleeping and resting
 inke liye pareshaan na hon
 Things taught at the Spa of Five Star Hotel
 close yor aij
 Healthy Living
 good living, in sabko tyaagna padegaa
 These are all nonsense
 agar kaamyaab hona he, to inase kuch nahin hoga
 Have to be tense
 beepi badhegaa hi
 If you want success, you cannot even think of being comfortable
 yahi ishwariya satya he
 Not allowed to rest
 koi jarurat nahin he sone khaane kii
 If you cannot make a secret, then success will not come
 main leji hum
 Like being with children, playing video games, reading
 magar ye sab nahin karata
 i get up and go to work
 pen sahanaa padhegaa
 Will have to move forward with pain
 agar kaamyaab nahin hona, to jaise chaaho, vaise raho
 i feel jealous with those who do not want to succeed
 umr 50 ke kareeb pahunchane par bhi aapaki javaani sadabahaar bani hui he
 What is the secret? Shah Rukh: He has his own destiny
 allaah kii dein he
 Who we are, we love those who quarrel with nature, the little black long, the heroine who comes in the bag
 khayr majaak alag, main apni koectress ko bahut pyaar karata hum
 i respect him
 magar mujhe lagata he ki age kaa koi fark nahin padataa
 It should not be a criteria
 khaastaur par hamaare profeshan main
 Acting is called the profession of beauty
 magar ye asal main tallent kaa profeshan he
 Juhi Chawla, Madhuri Dixit, Sridevi ji reached the peak of her career
 ab durbhaagya se ham samajhate hai ki inkaa vakt biit gaya
 But this is not true
 mere liye ye sab hameshaa khubasurat or mahaan actress rahengi
 And here i am, sweetheart, as soon as i feel 50 years old
 main inke saath kaam karnaa phir se shuru kar duungaa
 When i talk about creativity, there is a lot of emphasis on youth
 shahrukh ke romantic tips
 
 -agar aap apane shabdon or harkaton se aurat kii beijjati karte hai, to ye pyaar romance kii duniya aapke liye nahin he
 Open the car door intjaar karnaa, unke baithne se pehle nahin baithna
 i do all this and believe in it
 apane bete ko bhi yahi sikhaata hum
 i do not abuse in front of women
 -asli mard wo hota he, jo apane bheetar ke aurat ke paksh ko chhu sake
 Could express jab shahrukh ne kii hina rabbaani khar kii taribais bich shahrukh audiyans main baithi pakistan kii purv videsh mantri hina rabbaani khar se rubaru hue
 He said, 'mashalla, you are very beautiful
 ' ankar ne bataaya ki unke pati bhi saath main hai, to apane sens of humar kaa istemaal karte hue shahrukh bole, 'aap bhi bahut khubasurat hai
 Hina invited Shahrukh to visit Pakistan
 shahrukh bole ki mere pita ke saath maine sabase khubasurat vakt peshawar or lahore-karachi main bitaayaa
 He was very happy to see his childhood-youth once
 pakistan se maine mehmaannawaaji or pyaar siikhaa
 i agree and also teach my children that whatever issues are there between India and Pakistan
 tanaav he or mere ye kehane ke baad vivaad bhi ho saktaa he
 But really there should be love between the two countries
 kaash donon mulkon main pyaar ho jaae: king khanshahrukh bole ki donon deshon kii janata ke bich itani nafrat nahin he
 If you go out, in London or America, it doesn't seem to be from India or Pakistan
 hamen ateet kaa boj bhuulakar aage badhanaa hoga
 My wife's grandmother is more than 90 years old
 nani mere dost rajeev shukla ko pichley baras rokar bol rahi thim, mere liye lahore kii mitti le aana bas
 
 
 All i want is friendship and love in both the countries

 a case of cheating of crores of rupees in the name of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana has come up in Chhattisgarh
 thagi kii vaardaaton ko aparaadhiyon ne nahin balki saikado gaanvon ke sarpanchon ne anjaam diya he
 Dozens of sarpanches in Raipur have been involved in this case of cheating
 prashasan ne hairat jaahir kii he ki pradhanmantri awaas yojana bhi dhokhadhadi kaa jariya kaise ban gai
 However, the district administration has lodged a police complaint against half a dozen sarpanches of the Arang block
 pehla maamla amodi gaanv ke sarpanch punit ram sahu ke khilaaf darj hua he, jabaki doosraa maamla tilda gram panchayat ke sarpanch ke khilaa darasal pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke tahat nimna aay varg ke beghar logon ko makaan aavantit hota he
 The sarpanches, using their rights and influence, allotted houses to those who already owned their houses
 iske evaj main prayek vyakti se 50 hajaar rupee liye gaye or to or puraane makaanon ko nayaa bataa kar unhen pradhanmantri awaas yojana ke daayre main laa kar makaan maalikon se 15 se 25 hajaar rupee tak vasuul liye gaye
 This construction was recorded only on paper
 aarang ke amodi gaanv main is tarah kii shikaayat milane ke baad jila panchayat ke siio neelesh kumaar ne jaanch karai
 This investigation was found to be true
 iske baad aarang thane main sarpanch ke khilaaf thagi kii FIR darj karai gai
 a similar fraud was reported with hundreds of people in Tilda Gram Panchayat after this matter came to light
 yahaan bhi sarpanch ke khilaaf dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj karaayaa gaya
 The way the Prime Minister's housing scheme has been exposed in Raipur, the same mess has happened in a dozen districts of the state
 bataaya jaataa he ki sarpanchon ne panchayaton ke baabuon se sathganth kar kaagajon main hi pradhanmantri awaas taiyaar kar liye or pehle to sarkaar ko chuunaa lagaaya phir graminon ko
 Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, an amount of Rs 50 thousand was registered under the head of construction work
 phir jis vyakti ko yah makaan aavantit kiya janaa bataaya gaya, us vyakti se bhi munhmaangi keemat vasuul kii gai
 The administration is shocked by this case of double fraud
 jila panchayat raipur ke adishnal siio harishankar chouhan ne bataaya he ki pradhanmantri awaas yojana ko lekar saikadon shikaayatein mili hai
 Instructions are being given to register their FIR after conducting their examination

 After the imposition of President's rule, on the one hand, there is talk of Shiv Sena to form a government on the memorial day of Balasaheb Thackeray
 vahiin duusari taraf nai sarkaar ke gathan main jis rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) kii bhoomika ahm maani ja rahi he, ab uski ore se bhi bayaan aayaa he
 According to news agency ANI, NCPK chief Sharad Pawar has said that it will take a little more time to form the government
 pavaar shuukravaar ko nagpur main congress vidhayak nitin raut ke awaas par pahunche the, jahaan unhone vaartalap ke dauraan yah baaten kahin
 He dismissed the possibility of mid-term elections and said that there may be a slight delay in forming the government, but a permanent government will be formed in the state for 5 years
 pavaar kaa yah bayaan unki congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke saath sarkaar gathan ke mudde par hone vaali baithak se pehle aayaa he
 Pawar's meeting with Sonia is to be held in Delhi between NCP Chief Sharad Pawar and Congress President Sonia Gandhi on the issue of government formation in Maharashtra
 jaankaree ke mutabik sonia gandhi se milane ke liye sharad pavaar 17 yaa 18 november ko dilli jane vaale hai
 At such a time, even as the Common Minimum Program, drafted before the formation of the government between the three parties, is yet to be approved by the top leaders, the prospects of forming a government on Balasaheb Thackeray's Memorial Day seem to be slim
 bataa den ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav sattadhari bhaajapa or shivasena kaa rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ne saath milakar ladaa tha

 chunaav nattejey aane ke baad shivasena or bhaajapa ke bichmukhyamantriki kursi ko lekar khinchataan shuru ho gai
 The Shiv Sena stuck to the 50-50 formula and broke its alliance after the BJP was not ready to give the cm's chair, and had to resign its resignation from Arvind Sawant, a minister in the Modi government at the Center
 unhone nitish kumaar par tanj kasate hue kaha ki ham unako aaj vah kavita yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai joki ek kavita ke madhyam se jo unhone bijepi or narendra modi par sunai thi

 Priyanka Chaturvedi joined Shiv Sena
 isse pehle istipha dene ke liye priyanka chaturvedi ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko ek bhavuk patr likhaa he
 Priyanka has said that Congress talks about respect, safety and dignity of women, but this is not seen in the behavior of many party leaders
 priyanka ne likhaa he ki jin logon ne mere khilaaf abhadrata kii unhen phir se party main shaamil kar liya gaya, tark diya gaya ki chunaav main sabhi kii jarurat he
 The same day i decided that after this insult i should leave this party
 rahul gandhi ko likhe patr main priyanka chaturvedi ne likhaa, "main ye istipha behad dukhi hokar likh rahi hum, maine 10 saal pehle youth congress mumbai main jwine kii thi, kyonki main party kii vichaardhaara, or aapke samaveshi, pragatisheel or udaar raajnneeti main vishwaas karti thi
 "my children also abused
 Priyanka Chaturvedi further wrote," In these 10 years, the party gave me many platforms from which i took forward the ideology of the party
 " priyanka chaturvedi ne kaha ki party jab apane sabase nichle str par chali gai thi to unhone puri nishtha , samparn or bhaavana ke saath kai plateform par party kaa paksh rakhaa

 unhone kaha ki unhen ummid thi ki party unki ummiido kaa sammaan karegi
 Priyanka further writes, "A few things happened in the last few weeks, which made me feel that my services are no longer valued in the party, and i reached a place from which i cannot return
 saath-saath mujhe ye bhi ehsaas ho rahaa he ki main jitna zyada vakt main congress ko duungi wo meri khud kii pratishtha or maryaada kii keemat par hoga
 "women are a matter of respect, not seen in practice, Priyanka wrote to Rahul," The things that i am disappointed about is that where the party talks about the safety, respect and empowerment of women, you also have their rights
 We talk, but this is not seen in the behavior of some party leaders
 jab main party ke liye aadhikarik daure par thi tabhi mere saath ek gambhir, ghatana hui, lekin party ne ise nazarandaaj kar diya
 After this incident i became convinced that it was time for me to move forward and i should focus outside the Congress
 "rahul ko aage ke liye shubhakamana dete hue priyanka ne kaha ki unke man main rahul gandhi liye apaar shraddha or shubh kaamana he, ve party ke sabhi netaaon kaa aabhaar jataana chahengi, jo unke saath khadey rahe, unka utsaah badhaayaa
 Priyanka has finally written that she should be immediately relieved of all the responsibilities of the Congress party
 bataa den ki isse pehle priyanka ne twit kar kaha tha ki congress ko khun pasinaa dene waalon kii jagah is party main gundon ko tavajjo di ja rahi he
 Priyanka had said that she abused the party, but despite this, it was the leaders of the party who threatened her, the people who were threatening them, who survived, are unfortunate to escape without any action
 priyanka ke saath badasluki kaa maamla unke mathura daure se judaa he, jab unhone rafel se judaa ek press conference kiya tha

 However, political parties have expressed their displeasure over the incident
 aarake narayan, padhane-likhane or sahitya se ruchi rakhane vaale har shaks ne yah naam jarur suna hoga
 RK Narayan, one of the best Indian writers, used to write in English
 unka puraa naam rasipuram krishnaswami narayanswami tha
 He was born on 10 October 1906 in Chennai, then Madras
 kehete hai unhen unki daadi ne paala tha, jinaki kahaniyon ne bachapan main hi unamem jigyaasa bhar di
 With his English writing, an incident in the life of Narayan, who has accumulated the whole world in India, can surprise and inspire anyone
 apane daur kaa yah mahaan upanyaaskaar grajuation kii pariksha main usee vishay main fail ho gaya tha, jisamen usne baad main likhnaa shuru kiya
 Narayan's first novel 'swami and Friends' came out in 1935
 unke is upanyaas main schuli ladakon ke ek dal ke romaanchak karnaamon kaa mjedaar byoraa he
 It is said that when Doordarshan created a serial called 'malgudi Days' with the stories and characters of Narayana, it changed the world of small screens in those days
 yah dharawahik hindi va angrezi main bana tha
 Doordarshan aired a total of 39 episodes of Malgudi Days
 darasal narayan kii sabhi kritiyon kii prishthbhumi main dakshin bharat kaa kaalpanik shahar malgudi he
 Narayan portrays the characteristics of human relationships and the irony of daily life
 unke paatr chote kasbe ke hai, jinka aadhunik shahari vyavastha, swaarth, badlaav va puraani paramparaon ke saath itnaa atoot naata he ki takaraahat hoti rahati he
 The amazing thing is that the publisher for the first four books of Narayan was found by the noted author Graham Greene of English
 unhone ‘swami and frends’ likhane ke baad use apane ek dost kii marfat kai prakashkon ko bheja, magar kisi ko vah pasand nahin ai
 Eventually, Narayan asked his friend to immerse the manuscript of 'swami and Friends' in the River Thames
 par us dost ne ek or chance liya or aisa karne kii bajaay pandulipi graham green tak pahunchaa di
 Graham Greene was fascinated by the genre when he read the novel
