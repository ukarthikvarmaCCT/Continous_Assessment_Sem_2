 BCCI, the country's most popular sport and its world's richest institution
 kisi ne sochaa tak nahin hoga ki bhartiya cricket control board jisaki tuuti antarrashtriya cricket samiti yani isisi tak bolti he uske do taqatvar adhyaksh, pehle en shrinivasana or phir anuraag thakur ko is tarah apane pad se haath dhonaa padegaa
 The person responsible for this shocking development of world cricket is said to be the most responsible businessman Aditya Verma from Chhapra, a small district of Bihar
 53 saal ke aditya kabhi bihar kii ranjai team kaa hissaa hua karte the or unki ladaai bhi is team ko dobaaraa uski pahchaan dilaane ke liye hi thi
 When Aditya Verma decided to hand over the two BCCI bosses, his fight was only for the Bihar Cricket Association to get recognition from the BCCI
 bisisiai ke isse inkaar karne par verma ne court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 Gradually, this legal struggle led to the most revolutionary changes in Indian cricket history and led to the dismissal of veterans like Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke
 2000 main padi thi jhagade kii neenvaditya verma kii is ladaai kii neenv padi saal 2000 main jab madhyapradesh or uttar pradesh ke saath-saath bihar kaa bhi vibhaajan hua or kramshah chhattisgarh, uttarakhand or jharkhand jaise pradesh astitv main aae
 The cricket associations of Madhya Pradesh and UP had no major impact on this division, but the name of Bihar Cricket Association was changed to Jharkhand Cricket Association
 bisisiai ne use purna rajya association kii manyata bhi de di
 Verma started his fight with the Bihar Cricket Association demanding recognition
 ve is association ke sachiv hai
 In 2013, after the IPL fixing case of N
 Srinivasan, the chair of fixing, surfaced, Verma petitioned the Bombay High Court to declare the panel set up by the BCCI to investigate the matter unconstitutional
 unki yachikaaon par sunwaayee ke dauraan court ke ek ke baad ek aae adeshon ke baad hi bisisiai ke purv pramukh en shrinivasana ko apni kursi chhodane par majaboor hona padaa
 It was then believed that behind Aditya Verma is the hand of Lalit Modi, Srinivasan's arch-rival who is trying to evict Srinivasan on the pretext of Varma
 khaas baat ye ki shrinivasana kii vidaai or anuraag thakur kii bisisiai ke adhyaksh pad par tajposhi ke baavjood aditya kaa makasad hal nahin hua kyonki bihar kii association ko manyata nahin mili
 Verma now hopes that the withdrawal of Thakur and the implementation of the recommendations of Justice Lodha Committee will pave the way for recognition for Bihar
 bisisiai main nizaam badla, niyat nahinaditya kaa tark he ki jab gujarat or maharashtra jaise rajyon kii teen-teen timen ranjai main khelti hai to bihar jaise bade rajya ko isse kyon maharoom rakhaa gaya he
 The Bihar Cricket Association was a full member of the BCCI since 1935
 uski ranjai team bhi thi jisamen khud bharat ke sabase safal captain mahendra singh dhoni khel chuke hai
 It is not being recognized only because the BCCI bosses were expected to cast their vote against them
 aditya ne jab ye ladaai shuru kii thi tab media main unke tarkon ko zyada tarjeeh nahin di jaati thi
 The way he filed petitions in the court, his close friends started telling him habitually to the petitioner
 unka betaa bengal kii under 19 team se khel chukaa he or jaanata he ki pita kii bisisiai aakaaon se adaavat ke chalate uskaa aage kaa kariyar syah he
 Aditya Verma may be low profile but he has many friends in politics and cricket
 jab se bisisiai se unhone do-do haath shuru kiye hai tab se unke kai nae dost bane hai to kuch puraane unase alag bhi hue hai
 In a conversation with a website, he himself told that many current and outgoing officials of BCCI were in touch with him
 ve bijepi netaa yashavanth sinha or abhinayta se netaa bane shatrughna sinha ke liye bhi kaam kar chuke hai

 On Wednesday evening, Nitish Kumar resigned as Chief Minister and parted ways with the RJD, the Congress-led Grand Alliance and joined hands with the bjp-led NDA
 nitish kumaar aaj subah 10 baje bihar ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lenge
 If BJP also joins Nitish's government, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also reach the eclipse
 congress kii aguwai vaale vipakshi dalon ne nitish ke is kadam kii khulkar aalochana kii he
 Omar Abdullah has called Nitish a 'mubarak Mubarak', while cpi's d Raja said that there was doubt about Nitish and it happened
 ab chunki nitish, narendra modi ke saath khadey hai, to sawaal ye he ki vipakshi dalon kii siyaasi ekajutata kitni majboot hai
 Where are the opposition parties - Jatktish's departure with the BJP at the national level has come as a shock to the opposition's efforts to form a grand alliance against the Narendra Modi-led BJP at the national level

 bihar main nai sarkaar aane ke baad argedy vidhayakon ke tuutane kaa bhi dar he
 The challenge before Lalu is to keep his mlas together
 dekhnaa ye he ki in sab baadhaon ke bich lalu yadav apni siyasat kii gaadi ko kitna sambhaal pate hai
 a major setback for the Congress was the Congress being part of the alliance in Bihar
 kaha jaataa tha ki nitish ke saath rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke sambandh thik the
 Congress has also had its own political partnership with Lalu
 phir bhi congress netritv mahagathbandhan bachaane main naakaamayaab rahaa
 However, Lalu has been more reliable than Nitish for the Congress and that seems to be the reason that the Congress could not go against Lalu
 nitish ke endie main chale jane se congress kii narendra modi ke khilaaf gheraabandi kii koshishen kamjor hui he
 There was a difference of opinion within the Congress in this cross firing of lalu-nitish
 kuch netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki nitish dabaav banane kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai, to varisht netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki bihar main game puraa ho gaya he
 And in the same confusion, the power sharing of power in Bihar slipped from the Congress

Rajesh lehr ko habiba ka salaam😆( in joke)— Farah Khan (@thefarahkhan)september 4, 2016 Prosecutors in the anti-terrorism court, hearing the trial of seven accused involved in the Mumbai attacks, on Monday filed an application seeking permission to interrogate an Indian judge and police officer in the case through video conferencing

 Earlier, Pakistan had recorded the confessional statement of Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist caught carrying out the Mumbai attacks from India, Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate R

 Sawant Waghule and investigating officer Ramesh Mahale were asked to be sent to the anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi for testimony
 bharat ne in donon adhikariyon ko pakistan bhejne kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya tha lekin saath hi yah bhi kaha tha ki unase video conferencig ke jariye baat kii ja sakati he
 Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik says it is a legal requirement to take testimony from both Indian officials and this will help speed up the proceedings against the seven Pakistani suspects
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki donon bhartiya adhikariyon kii gavaahi isaliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki yah mukadmaa kaaphi had tak kasaab ke bayaan par nirbhar karata he
 The lawyers defending all the seven accused in the court, including Lakhvi, are calling this prosecution's plea to hang the proceedings
 bachaav paksh ke adhivaktaaon main shaamil shahabaaz rajput ne kaha ‘‘yah yachika fujul or vakt kii barbaadi karne vaali he
 According to the current laws of Pakistan, it is not possible to take any statement through video conferencing
 ’rajput ne kaha ‘‘ham is arji kaa virodh karenge
 Our client has been in custody for almost two years and the filing of such petitions by the prosecution is a clear sign that he wants to hang the case

 Crores of rupees were spent in the name of correcting this plight of the Ganges
 desh kii sabase badi adaalat ne bhi ganga kii dasha ko thik karne ke liye sarkaar ko fatkaar lagaai
 The Modi government also made big promises to Ganga, but the pain of the Ganges remains the same
 baavjood iske shraddha or aasthaa kam nahin hui
 On the day of the descent of the Ganges, thousands of people took a dip in the Ganges and worshiped
 lekin isi pujan-archan main ganga main log phool maala chadhaate hai
 This is a sign of faith of thousands of devotees, but this belief also gives the pain of pollution to Ganga
 jab ganga apni tej dhara ke saath ithlaati hui baha karti thi, tab to wo in phool-maalaon ko samet kar apane daaman se dur phenk aati thi or apane bhakton ke liye vah nirmal bani rahati thi
 But today Ganges is imprisoned in many dams
 uski dam tod chuki dhara main itani taaqat nahin ki wo ise baha sake
 So this faith of the people is overshadowing him
 snanarthi nirmal bhi isse ittefaq rakhte hue kahati hai ki aasthaa ke naam par ham hi log phool, maala chadhaakar gandagi failaa rahe hai
 It should be that it is all in one corner somewhere
 is tarah kii aasthaa ganga ke daaman main daag zarur he, par bada dard ganga main gir rahe naale or factoriyon kaa kachra he
 According to a rough estimate, 3000 MLD sewage is dumped into the Ganges every year, with 300 MLD sewage being dumped in Benares alone
 ganga main daale jane vaale sivej main ham sirf 1000 MLD kaa hi treetment kar pate hai, baaki 2000 MLD sivej aise hi baha diya ja rahaa he
 The comments 1986 se shuru hue ganga ection plan se lekar aaj tak karodon rupee bah gaye, lekin ganga kii dasha nahin sudhari
 People are totally hopeless now
 ghat par hi jinaki jindagi chalati he wo ghat ke pujari baccha mahraaj ganga kii safai ko poochhate hi fat padate hai, "assi se varuna tak naala bah rahaa he, assi se varuna tak kooda gir rahaa he, assi se varuna tak phool maalaaen sad rahi hai
 Corpses are flowing koi badlaav nahin he
 " is bekadari ne ganga ke pani ko pine or nahaane kii koun kahe aachman laayak bhi nahin choda
 But the Ganges is not just a river, it flows in our hearts more than it flows on the land
 hazaron karod rupee kharch karne or tamaam daavon or vaadon ke baad bhi din ba din ganga kii dasha kharaab hi hoti ja rahi he, lekin ganga ke prati aasthaa or shraddha aaj bhi utani hi balwati he
 That is why the Ganges, however dirty it has become, thousands of people dip in its lap
 ganga ke avataran ke din hazaron logon ne ganga main dubkee lagaai or pujan-archan kiya
 But in this worship, people offer flower garlands in the Ganges
 yah hazaron shraddhaluon kii aasthaa kii nishaani he, par yahi aasthaa ganga ko pradooshan kaa dard bhi de jaati he
 When the Ganges used to flutter with its strong current, it would throw these flowers and garlands and throw it away from its clasp and remain serene to its devotees
 par aaj ganga kai baandhon main kaid he
 There is not much strength in his dead stream that he can shed it
 lihaaja logon kii ye aasthaa us par baari pad rahi he
 Nirmal, a bathmate, also agrees, saying that in the name of faith, we are spreading flowers by garlanding flowers
 hona ye chahie ki ye sab kahin ek kinare kone main ho
 Such faith is definitely a stain in the Ganges, but the great pain is the waste of the drains and factories falling in the Ganges
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabiq har saal 3000 MLD sivej ganga main daal diya jaataa he, jisamen akele banaras main 300 MLD sivej daalaa jaataa he
 In the sewage dumped in the Ganges, we are able to treat only 1000 MLD, the remaining 2000 MLD sewage is being shed like this
 tippaniyan From the Ganga Action Plan started in 1986, crores of rupees have been washed away, but the condition of Ganga has not improved
 log ab bilkul naa-ummid hai
 Those whose life goes on the ghats, the priest of the ghat bursts as soon as the child asks Maharaj Ganga cleaning, "the drain is flowing from eighty to Varuna, garbage is falling from eighty to Varuna, flower garlands are rotting from eighty to Varuna
 Huh
 laashen bah rahi hai
 There is no change
 " Who said that drinking water of Ganga and bathing, did not leave even the hunger
 par ganga sirf nadi nahin he, ye jitna jameen par bahati he, usase zyaada hamaare dilon main bahati he
 Even after spending thousands of crores of rupees and all the claims and promises, the condition of Ganga is getting worse day by day, but the faith and reverence for Ganga is equally strong today
 tabhi to ganga chaahe jitani gandi ho gai ho, uske god main hazaron log dubkee lagaate nazar aate hai

 The sweltering afternoon of the 4th of April
 15veen loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj kii safed rang kii esayuvi gaadi madhya pradesh ke raisen jile ke riterning adhikari ke parisar main pahunchati he
 Only after a moment the convoy of CM Shivraj Singh Chauhan arrives here, Chauhan's wife Sadhna Singh is also with him
 chouhan dampati kii maujuudagi main, kadak sooti sari or kaali nehru jaikat pahane sushamaa swaraj ko namakan bharne main 15 minute bhi nahin lage
 Soon afterwards she reached the Durga temple near Vidisha
 yahaan pujari ne unhen aashirwad diya, ‘‘pradhanmantri bhav:,’’ ise sunakar sushamaa ke man main laddu jarur phute honge
 The late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray also once said that Sushma was his first choice for the post of Prime Minister
 to kya vidisha se ek or ummidavaar sambhavit pradhanmantri ho saktaa he? gaur talab he ki atal bihari vaajapeyi yaheen se chunaav jitkar pradhanmantri bane the
 BJP President of Vidisha district Toran Singh Dangi's reply is, "here we don't need to promote any person
 party or uskaa chinh hi kaaphi he
 Dangi, the convener of Sushma Swaraj's election campaign, tries to explain why the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was not named in the election campaign meetings chaired by Sushma at the grassroots level
 hairat kii baat nahin ki vidisha kii tang or dhul bhari galiyaan jin postaron se ati hai ve party ke rashtriya str ke us abhiyaan se bhinn hai, jahaan modi hi chhaae hai
 While bjp's national posters have a slogan of "this time Modi government", in this city, along with these posters, local activists have put posters of Sushma, which reads, "how should the leader of the country" , Be like Sushma Swaraj
 ’’pichley maah sushamaa ne party kaaryakartaaon ko kai baar sambodhit kiya lekin modi ke naam kaa ullekh sirf ek baar-24 march ko raisen main kiya
 In her speeches, she praises Chauhan, "the BJP has a leader as prime minister as Narendra Modi, and a great leader in Madhya Pradesh as Shivraj Singh Chauhan
" chouhan kaa kushal netritv, janata kii samasyaon ke prati samvedansheeltaa, jan-kalyaan yojanaayen or centre main upie sarkaar ke kushasan ke prati naaraazgi hamen pradesh main baari safalataa dilavaayengi

 Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Renuka Chaudhary said during the party's regular press briefing that the Congress president had consulted senior party leaders and law experts to come out with the harshest law to prevent such crimes
 choudhary ne is sawaal kaa sidhaa jawaab nahin diya ki kya balaatkaar ke doshiyon ko raasayayanic rup se napunsak bana dene kii maang par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he

 Chaudhary did not give any direct answer to the questions asked about bjp's demand to call a special session of Parliament on this issue and said that the matter is related to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs

 The government is afraid of calling a special session: Shahnawaz Hussain: The BJP today appeared unaffected by a letter written by Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde to all parties to get an idea for changes in the anti-rape law and said that he would raise his voice in Parliament
 Will use as a platform
 party ne vishesh satr bulaae jane kaa aahvaan kiya
 BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said, "we will use the Parliament tax to convey our thoughts
" ham sarkaar ko puraa sahyog dene ko taiyaar hai, lekin congress apane adiyal ravaiye or ahankaar kii vajah se vishesh satr bulaane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Hussain said, "this government is ready to speak on the issue in the Congress office or before the Verma Commission, but is not ready to convene a special session of Parliament
" yah logon se tathaa ise nirvaachit karne waalon se bhaybheet he 
 The BJP leader said that this "factor of fear" in facing the opposition is preventing the government from calling a special session

 madhyakaalin itihaas ke kirdaaron main taimur langs ke bare main na jane kitne myth or kisse-kahaniyaan janamanas main hai
 But when Timur himself testifies to the fabrication of his inside and outside, then the whole mist automatically begins to clear: the insistence on conquering the world; Wielding arms and pens with both hands; 3,000 hangman cradles; To become rash and cruel by daring; To be amused by the bloodshed bursting after the murder; Do not consider any religion to be greater than Islam; Avoiding breaking temple-idols; To further honor scholars, artists and religious leaders
 taimur langs kii yah aapbeetee pehali dfa hindi main ai he, vah bhi khaasaa chakkar khate hue
 It took about 400 years for it to come from Persian to English (in 1783)
 phir urdu main anuwaad hua
 The availability of versions of these languages in India is not much visible, while Babur's autobiography Baburnama, which came a century after the dynasty of Timur, is well known
 khayr ab urdu-farsi kii jaankaar sanjana kaul ne ise kareeb 550 pannon main salike se (thodaa zyada) hindi main pesh kiya he
 Timur wrote his anecdote on the last place of life while preparing for an attack on China
 kanthsth kuran kii ek-ek aayat par dharmikon se bahes karata or unhen vidwaan paane par inaam detaa lekin moulana rumi or duusare aadhyatmavaadiyon kii laanat-malamat karata
 On this attitude of her, her objection translator of Urdu Dr
 hamid yajdani bhi apana gussa roak na sake
 In his comment he adds, "the man who did
 
 
 itane narsanhaar kiye ki islam ke maathe par or inasaaniyat ke liye bada kalank kaa tikaa sabit hua, kis munh se moulana rumi kaa virodh karata he
 
 
 Even a man like Timur cannot match the dust of his shoes
 "taimur kii aatmakatha padhate hue aap pehali baar khaal oodhedgaye, khaulate tel main maarane or bhus bharne jaisi krur or naarkeey yaatnaaon kaa byora pate hai
 Perhaps the cruelest act of this most ruthless ruler in history is during the occupation of the city of Sabzwar, when he orders the surviving civilians to behead the dead
 vah likhata he, ''bahut jaldi dedh lakh inasaani sir donon taraf jamaa ho gaye
 i wanted these heads to be built like harem and on which the fire should be lit at night
 "yah kitaab hamen us vakt ke madhya purv or ureshian bhugol ke alaava vahaan ke kabyli jivan or unki samskritiyon se rou-ba-rou karaati he
 Religion laws are at the top for Taimur, but breaking the rhythm of the tales in between, he tells the readers of Aapbeeti that he who has to rule will have to be merciless
 pehali hatya vah 14 kii umr main madrase ke ek sahpaathee kii karata he jo usase samalangik sambandh chahta he
 At the age of 19, he kills the military head of the ruler of Samarkand at the behest of Launda
 isi tarah ke vaakyon or ek sapane se vah arth nikaalata he ki allaah use shaasha bananaa chahta he
 Timur's journey to India and his plunder is in more than a hundred pages, but he has been referring to the prosperity of India and his greed towards it from the beginning
 dilli ke paas ek padaav ke dauraan daliton kaa ek dal uske saamne aakar apane puure samaaj kii dayaniyata jataate hue musalmaan banane kii ichha jataata he
 Timur not only converted them on a large scale but also made land for them in Quetta
 par dilli ke kile kaa ek vakya dilachasp he
 a temple priest says that if he attacked, his age would be reduced to seven years

 isro vaigyanikon ne chandrayan-2 ke launch ko lekar kaaphi badlaav kiye the
 Chandrayaan-2 could be sent directly to the moon, so why are scientists rotating so much? Former scientist Vinod Kumar Srivastava told that India can send Chandrayaan-2 directly to the moon, like America, Russia and China
 lekin iske liye zyada taqatvar rocket kii jarurat padegi
 Also, Chandrayaan-2 required more fuel
 iske liye uske aakaar ko badhanaa padataa
 But, ISRO scientists are rotating the moon around the earth so that the moon comes closer to the earth
 prithvi ke chaaron taraf paanch chakkar lagane ke dauraan chandrayan-2 chand ke behad najadik pahunch jayega
 He will then be drawn towards the moon by the gravitational force of the moon

 ) So far we have believed that Subhash Chandra Bose had first given the slogan 'jai Hind', but according to a book based on the great personalities and short stories of Hyderabad, this slogan was first given by Netaji's secretary and interpreter, who Hailing from Hyderabad and who left his engineering studies in Germany to work with Netaji

 One of these interesting stories is related to the origin of the slogan 'jai Hind'
 lekhak ke anusaar yah naaraa hyderabad ke ek colector ke bete jainul abidin hasan ne diya tha, jo ejineering kii padhai karne ke liye germany gaye the
 According to Luther, during World War II, Netaji had gone to Germany to seek support for the armed struggle to liberate India
 unhone kaha, 'netaji vahaan bhartiya yuddh kaidiyon or anya bharatiyon se mili or unase apni ladaai main shaamil hone kii apil kii
 Hasan met Netaji and, inspired by his patriotism and sacrificial spirit, spoke of finishing his studies and working with him
 ' According to this book published by Niyogi Books, 'netaji taunts Hassan saying that if he is worried about such small things then he will not be able to work for bigger purposes
 yah sunakar hasan ne apni padhai chhod di or netaji ke sachiv or dubhashie ban gaye
 ' lekhak ke anusaar hasan baad main iene (indian neshnal army) main major ban gaye or burma (myanmar) se bharat kii seemaa paar tak ke march main hissaa liya
 The INA had then reached Imphal
 aapurti or hathiyaaron kii kami kii vajah se use peeche hatana padaa tha
 Luther wrote, 'netaji wanted an Indian parent message for his army and independent India
 bahut sari salahen milin
 Hassan first uttered the word 'hello', on which Netaji rebuked him
 phir unhone 'jai hind' kaa naaraa diya, jo netaji ko pasand aayaa or is tarah 'jai hind' iene or krantikari bharatiyon ke abhivadan kaa aadhikarik rup ban gaya
 Later it was adopted as the official slogan of the country

 Addressing a press conference at East Champaran district headquarters Motihari, BJP national spokesperson Hussain alleged that the repealed constitutional provision snatched a woman's right to ancestral property in the event she married someone outside Jammu and Kashmir
 , Which was against Sharia
 unhone kaha ki jo muslim buddhijivi jammu-kashmir ko lekar narendra modi sarkaar kii karrwai kaa virodh kar rahe hai or ise hindu banaam muslim mudda bana rahe hai, unase ek sawaal he ki kya unhen lagata he ki anuchhed 35 e islam ke sharia kanoon ke anusaar tha
 Enforcement Directorate seized assets worth Rs 2
89 million from Naxalite commanders, Hussein said as per Sharia law, a girl cannot be deprived of her rights over property inherited from her parents
 lekin anuchhed 35e ne use shartiya bana diya tha
 It was certainly against the principles of Islam apart from violating the right to equality provided by the Constitution
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki muslim buddhijiviyon ko is mudde par aatmanirikshan karnaa chahie
 Defending the statement of Union Minister Amit Shah to implement NRC across the country, Hussain asked what is the problem with the people

 ek saal main dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal or unki party ne kaaphi tarakkee kii he
 The AAP, which came to power by claiming to do politics of change, has stepped up the steps in one year
 phir chaahe vah dosti kaa maamla ho yaa dushmani kaa yaa phir lakshya kaa
 
 
 Sal Revenge, 'enemy Revenge': Arvind Kejriwal and his party who have jumped into politics with the issue of corruption have seen a lot of change in their attitude and attitude
 congress ke khilaaf muhim shuru karne vaali AAP kii dushmani ab sidhe bijepi se he
 The focus of the Aam Aadmi Party, which once surrounded the entire Congress on the pretext of former Delhi CM Sheila Dixit, has changed in a year
 bijepi kii aguwai vaali centre sarkaar se AAP kii takaraar jagajaahir he
 On the pretext of the Center, Delhi Police and Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung also keep sacrificing the anger of the man party

 Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan, once close to Kejriwal and his voice, also stood against him
 donon netaaon ne kejariwal kii nitiyon kaa virodh kiya or party ne unhen baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 The AAP has once become the biggest political challenge for the BJP, which the common man called Congress as bjp's B-team

 The deep friendship of these three has been seen against the Center on many issues

 The goal of the AAP to bring revolution is now to become politically strong and run the government

 The gas released from Balochistan is sent to the Punjab state of Pakistan, while the people of Balochistan do not have LPG for cooking
 bataa den ki baluchistan main gas, khanij or duusare prakritik sansadhano kii bharmaar he
 The Government of Pakistan, which is struggling with the financial crisis, is gradually exploiting these resources, but in this process, the local Baloch residents have been separated
 apane hi rajya ke prakritik sansadhano main hissaa naa milane par baluchistan ke log pakistan se baghawat par utar aae hai
 In Balochistan, the Pak army is terrorized by the local residents

 dilli ke buraadi main 11 maut ne sabko sann karke rakh diya
 But slowly, slowly, covered with mystery, speculation, apprehension, tantra-mantra, many ends of this story are beginning to take hold
 sabase bada saboot or gavaah wo register he, jo buraadi kii hatyaon kii insaide story bataa rahaa he
 According to sources, the suspicion of 11 deaths in Burari's house together is now stuck on Lalit, the younger son of the family
 ghar main baraamad hue register, diary or baaki sabooton se ishaara mil rahaa he ki tantra-mantra ke pher main hi buraadi kaa bhaatia parivaar hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye ujaad gaya
 Actually, whatever happened on the last Saturday and Sunday, the role of that started many years ago
 rajasthan ke chittorgarh se nikalakar dilli main apni mehnat ke balboote ghar or vyapaar jamaanevaale lalit ke pita bhopal singh kaa dehanth ho gaya
 Being the youngest son of the family, Lalit was very close to him
 jaahir he, pita kii maut kaa sabase bada sadma bhi lalit ko hi pahunchaa, jo vakt ke saath lagaataar gaharaata gaya
 Then it was not enough that Lalit's voice went into an accident a few years ago
 lambey ilaaj ke baavjood lalit kii aawaaj waapas nahin ai
 Lalit broke down due to his father's absence and inability to speak, but in the meantime a strange thing began to happen
 lalit ne 5-6 saal pehle se daawa karnaa shuru kiya ki use pita bhopal singh dikhaai dete hai
 Let's talk to him too
 ek din phir wo hua jisaki kisi ko ummid nahin thi
 Lalit's lost voice returned
 lalit ne apni awaz lautne kaa puraa shrey puja-paath or apni dharmik aasthaa ko diya
 His wife Tina, who was already very religiously inclined, also supported him
 aawaaj laut aane ke baad to lalit ko apane pita lagaataar dikhaai dene lage
 He started listening and obeying his orders
 pita kaa asar ab us par aisa tha ki wo unki awaz bhi hoobahoo nikaalane laga
 Lalit claimed that the deceased father Bhopal Singh was in touch with the whole family through him
 bakaul police lalit apane pita ke har aadesh ko un registeron main likhata gaya jo ghar se baraamad hue hai
 The Bhatia family also had blind faith in these feelings of Lalit, so they used to work according to Lalit
 ek rose lalit ke pita ne use parivaar se unki mulaakaat karaane kaa aadesh bhi diya
 In a register, Lalit has written quoting his father, 'I will come tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, if i cannot come then i will come later
 ' register main likhi har baat lalit likh rahaa tha
 After meeting his father, he started writing about meeting God in this register
 sari baaten is tarah likhi gayi jaise pita bhopal singh likh rahe hon
 It was further written in the register, 'you know that God can come to our house at any time, so be fully prepared
 ' beete shanivaar kii raat or ravivaar ke bich jo kuch bhaatia parivaar ne kiya us ke bare main bhi lalit ne register ke ek panne par tafsil se sabakuch likhaa he
 'there will be a shock at the last moment, the sky will move, the earth will move
 lekin tum ghabraana mat, mantra jaap tej kar dena, main tumhe bachaa luungaa
 Getting down when the water changes color, helping each other down
 tum maroge nahin, balki kuch bada hasil karoge
 'perhaps this was the order that the whole family lost their life to fulfill
 sutron ke mutabik, lalit maansik beemaari se grasit tha
 In medical science, it is also called shared psychotic disorder or dilution
 ye ek tarah kii beemaari he
 In this, one starts to see and hear even after his death
 aise log phir apane karibiyon ko bhi vahi mahasoos karwaanaa chahta he
 It is treated in medical science
 lalit ne manochikitsakon se milane ke bajaay baabaaon kii sharan le lee
 Wife also supported
 shaayad koi nahin tha jo lalit ko sahi vakt par sahi salaah de saktaa
 As time progressed, Lalit's illness also increased
 gharavaale uski baat or bhi zyaada maanane lage
 Even if her niece was not married, she did special worship then her relationship was fixed
 ghar khangaalane ke dauraan police ko kai diariyaan or register mili hai
 Among them, the 200-page register is the most strange, which was kept at the place of worship
 is par 27 may 2013 se likhane kii shuruyaat hui thi, jo bich main band ho gai
 But after that again in 2015 some things were written in the register
 is saal janvari maheene se register main tarah-tarah kii baaten likhi jaati thim
 The police have come to know that Lalit used to write these things and keep them in the register place of worship and according to the things written in the register, the people of this family used to set their daily routine
 ab haal ke dinon main lagaataar ho rahi entry ko dekh kar ye saafe he ki lalit in dinon is khaas kism kii maansik beemaari se kuch zyaada hi grasit tha

 ling anupaat main sab punjab or haryana kii baat karte hai
 In the 2011 census, the sex ratio is equal to that of Gujarat in Haryana
 iske liye aap jimmedaar nahin hai
 But tell me the whole truth
 sawaal (jairam se): sachhar cameti kii maane to gujarat ke musalmaan sabase zyada 73 fisadi shikshat hai
 The highest earning is from the Muslims of Gujarat
 sarkari naukari main sabase zyada musalmaan gujarat main hai
 These are the figures of your government and you show their awe
 jairam:jo mote taur par aarthik sthiti behatar he, vahaan musalmaan bhi behatar hai
 When the Sachar Committee report came
 tab maine vishleshan kiya tha
 Overall, Karnataka was better in Kerala, so did Muslims
 magar maharashtra kii baat karen to dakshin bharat kii tulana main vikaas nahin hua
 i am asking you a question
 gujarat ke 182 vidhayakon main se kitne musalmaan hai
 Amit Shah: The election of Gujarat is coming or the country is coming
 chunaav aa rahaa he desh kaa
 The people of the country are going to decide on the basis of 10 years of UPA rule
 unke netaa, unke kaam par jawaab maanga jayega
 Jairam Ramesh: We will give strong answers to all these questions in the election campaign
 gujarat dangon kii esaiti jaanch ke sawaal par
 Jairam Ramesh: Even while acquitting, the court said that the case cannot be prosecuted
 magar aapraadhik liptata ko nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 Amit Shah: In the Zakia Jafri case, the SIT clearly said that there is nothing to be prosecuted
 jaafaree ne aarope lagaaya he
 In eight cases
 jisamen bade haadase hue the
 He said that there is complete conspiracy
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki state mashinari ke bade bade afasar, mantri or siem shaamil hai
 In creating this SIT, the Gujarat government has no role in deciding its scope
 report supreme court ke paas jaati he
 The report notes that there is no evidence to prosecute
 court kahata he ki sahi court main daakhil kariye
 It can also be chalanged
 iske baad loar court main faisla aa gaya
 In that too Modi ji got acquitted
 magar congress abhi bhi mudda uthaa rahi he
 This is what we call polarization
 magar isse ghotaale kaa, mahangaai kaa, mudra sfiti kaa mudda nahin taala ja sakegaa
 Please come to the issues
 janata hindu muslim ke mudde se aage nikal chuki he
 But you are still stuck there
 jairam ramesh:asli agenda to aapkaa vahiin he
 It is a matter of GDP
 amit shah:agar parformens ke aadhaar par kisi ek party ko sabase zyada janadesh mila he, to vah bijepi ko mila he
 Question (from Amit Shah): Laws aside, humanity on one side
 jisane jo bhi kiya
 Whichever mistake
 magar mukhyamantri hone ke naate kya narendra modi kii ye jimmedaari nahin
 That once meet the riot victims
 shah:jab danga hua, modi ji ne aath muslim campon kaa or saat hindu campon kaa visit kiya tha
 At that time, all the people of the minority committee were found in the relief camp
 teen teen ghante baat kii
 It has a record
 magar apaprachaar chalaaya ja rahaa he
 There is no need of RTI for this
 main hi aapako uplabdh kara duungaa
 Jayaram: And three kilometers from his office is the Gulbarga Society
 vahaan danga ho rahaa he
 Amit Shah: You are living in a misunderstanding
 offis se tees kilometre dur he
 Speaking of the camp, he was created after the riots
 sawaal (jairam se): 2002 par aap aag babula ho jate hai
 But on the riots of 84, who was punished? Jairam Ramesh: No one can support the 84 riots
 narsanhaar tha
 Indira ji was told, you change your security force
 unhone nahin badale
 The ideology of the 2002 riots was a malice ideology
 amit shah:khud rajeev gandhi ne kaha tha ki bada ped girtaa he
 Then the earth is getting
 bada ped matlab indira ji
 And Sikh means earth
 jairam ramesh:hamaare adhyaksh ne saat aath saal pehle golden temple main maafee maangi thiswaal: magar insaaf nahin diyajayram ramesh:haa, ye sahi sawaal he
 But was there any punishment against Modi? maaya kodenani ke khilaaf maamla chal rahaa he
 Amit Shah: And they were punished
 gujarat main hi maamla chalakar hui
 Tell me what happened in Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler case
 jairam ramesh:agar adaalat se sajaa hui to nahin bachenge
 Modi never even apologized
 amit shah:modi ji ne baar baar kaha he ki agar aparaadh hua he, to sirf maafee se kaam nahin chalegaa
 a case should be registered under CRPC
 congress kaise kaam karti he
 When the 1984 massacre took place, Manmohan Singh who was then working in the Finance Ministry
 unako pakadakar maafee mangava di
 Jairam Ramesh: Manmohan Singh apologized to the House in 2005
 amit shah:usase kya fark padataa he
 Neither the Sikhs got justice
 or masalaa vahi he ki chunaav upie kii parformens par hoga
 Whether the election is on polarization or development issues
 aapaki haar tay he
 We are also accused
 court ne bhi jaanch kii
 But you do not want to discus at all
 apane upar lage aarope
 Question of the public (from Jairam): Will you give assurance that the perpetrators of 84 riots will be punished
 court ne sirf taarikh di he?jairam:haa, sajaa milegiswaal (amit shah se): modi kaa musalamaanon ke liye future plan kya he?shah:meri party sabake samaan vikaas main yakeen karti he
 When electricity reaches the village, water reaches, everyone gets the benefit
 hindu or musalmaan ko bhi
 i do not want development based on Hindu or Muslim
 ham sarkaar dharm ke hisaab par nahin chalaanaa chaahate
 Question (from Jairam): People are not able to digest Rahul Gandhi's thoughts yet
 2014 main kaise kar paaenge?jairam ramesh-rahul gandhi kejariwal se bhi do saal chote hai
 Youth are leaders
 raajnneeti ke marathon main hai
 He did not come to run 100 meters
 ham abhi 2014 kaa chunaav lard rahe hai
 He is talking about a change in the organization
 vah sirf is chunaav ke nazariye se mat dekhie
 There is a plan up front
 ham yah sweekaar karte hai ki kai jagahon par sanghathan kamjor he
 Kiran Kher's question to Jairam Ramesh: i have an Iltija
 manmohan singh ne 84 ke liye maafee maangi
 Sonia and Rahul have not apologized
 aap kehete hai ki gujarat ke loar court se insaaf nahin milte
 Who got justice from Delhi's lower court
 kam se kam unke liye muaavja to tay kar den
 Living in such a bad condition
 jairam ramesh:bilkul sahamat hum
 There should be compensation and justice
 ye galat he
 We have a stigma
 84 galat tha
 2002 was wrong
 mere haath main jo he, wo main karata
 There is a delay
 insaaf nahin mila he
 Amit Shah: Friends, there was a time when Jana Sangh and BJP used to talk about good governance
 tab tulanaatmak adhyayan ke liye hamaara shashan nahin tha
 Congress was there from Panchayat to Parliament
 ab ye sthiti nahin he
 The government ran at the center for six years
 17 praanton main ham bhagidaar rahe satta ke
 Today the performance of both parties is in front of the public
 donon partiyon ke netaa bhi uplabdh hai
 It is my request to the country through Aaj Tak that you should decide who should get power on the basis of performance
 jahaan tak upie ke 10 saal ke shashan kaa sarkaar he
 Failed on every front
 karpshan ke mudde par main kahuunga ki samvidhan rache jane ke baad se itani karpt sarkaar kabhi nahin ai
 Colgate, 2G Spectrum, Westland Chopper, Adarsh, Commonwealth
 mitron itane ghapale hue is sarkaar main ki aise teen kaarykram kam pad jaaenge
 CAG reports and recommendations exist in every scam
 bijli, petrol, gas, dijal
 According to Jairam Ramesh, there are commercial talks
 khaane pine kii jin chizon main mahangaai hui, janata ke saamne he
 The protection of borders, the protection of women, has failed everywhere
 jaise shrikrishna ne kaha tha, vijay hi vijay he
 The same thing can be said for the UPA
 vifal hi vifal he
 We are going to contest under the leadership of Mr
 Modi
 hamane unhen logon ke saamne prastut kar diya he
 Congress may not even speak
 magar rahul gandhi congress kii taraf se hai
 If i compare, Jairam will object
 hamane unhen pratyaashee banaaya he
 From an ordinary worker to the PM candidate, he is a frequent mandate politician
 sawaal (amit shah se): aap par tantra ke beja istemaal kaa aarope lagata he
 Case of Snoopgate
 chintaa ye he ki kya amit shah or modi, agar dilli aate hai, to kahin aisa to nahin ki tantra kaa istemaal kar citigens kii nigaraanee hogi
 Who is this Saheb? Amit Shah: The way the whole riot politics was tried to be built around Narendra Modi
 antatogatva desh kii sarvocch adaalat se bhi kuch nahin niklaa
 An attempt was made to force me into an encounter
 kuch nahin niklaa
 Similarly, we created a Judicial Commission for Snoopgate
 main is manch se puure desh kii janata ko kahana chahta hum
 The day the report arrives
 isamen bhi prachaar ke alaava kuch nahin nikalegaa
 Work has been done according to every norm of the government
 sawaal (jairam se): aap maanenge ki chargeshit main modi bari hue hai
 Jayaram: Amit Shah referred to the CAG report on corruption cases
 gujarat sarkaar par bhi kai report aae
 Reports came on the State Petroleum Corporation
 ye dabl standard nahin hone chahie
 Amit Shah - No government can take action in court
 agar modi ne kuch bhi galat kiya hota to aapaki enjio brigade hamaare peeche pad jaati
 Jairam Ramesh- BJP used to allege that CBI is Congress Bureau of Investigation
 ye to maayoos ho gaye ki inkaa naam chargeshit main nahin aayaa
 Now how will they repeat the allegations in public
 amit shah-sibiai ne ehsaan nahin kiye gaye
 On the first charge sheet, the court has sought para wise remark
 us par sibiai ne jawaab daakhil nahin kiya
 Question (from Amit Shah): The taperecorder that came out in Snoopgate
 usamen aawaaj kiski he?amit shah:judishal kamishan jab mujhe bulaaegaa or main jaaoongaa or apni baat rakhuunga
 The commission is limited, so will not say anything outside
 sawaal (amit shah se): aisa kyon he ki 84 ke baad bhi sikh kaum kii aasthaa congress ke saath he
 Many times our government was formed in Punjab
 lekin musalmaan usee tarj par bijepi ke saath kyon nahin aae
 Is it because your ideal is a Hindu nation, in which there is no place for Muslims
 golwalkar ji ne kitaab main likhaa, desh ke hinduon ko hitler se sabak lenaa chahie
 What do you have to say on this? Amit Shah: i have read Golwalkar's book
 aisa kahin nahin likhaa or doosraa sawaal, is baar musalmaan bhaaiyon ke vot se hi modi ji kii sarkaar banane ja rahi he

 endie kii ore se jediu saansad harivansh ko ummidavaar banaaya gaya he
 The NDA seems to be splitting up on this candidature, but JDU chief Nitish Kumar has started seeking support from other parties
 nitish ne isi masale par telugana ke mukhyamantri ke
 Talked to Chandrasekhar Rao
 unhone kesiar se phone par baat kii or unke ummidavaar ko samarthan karne kii baat kahi
 KCR assured him that he would take a decision on this only after talking to his party leaders and colleagues
 NDA main padi foot!rajyasabha main upasabhapati ke liye endie kii taraf se ummidavaar jediu saansad harivansh ko banaaye jane se endie kii do sabase puraani sahyogi partiyaan akali dal or shivasena naaraaz hai
 In fact, the Akali Dal hoped that the nda's deputy chairperson in the Rajya Sabha would be their candidate
 bataa den ki akali dal se naresh gujral kaa naam charchaa main tha lekin antim samay par bijepi ne jediu ke saansad harivansh ko ummidavaar bana diya jisase akali dal main naaraazgi hai
 The meeting of the Akali Dal Parliamentary Party headed by former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal took place at the house of Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal
 upasabhapati ke liye kya kahata he rajyasabha kaa ankaganit ?sankhyabal ke hisaab se dekha jaae to rajyasabha main kul sadasyon kii sankhya 244 he
 Meaning the NDA needs the support of 123 members for a majority
 bijepi ke 73, jediu ke 6, akali dal ke 3, shivasena ke 3, bodo pipul frant ke 1, naga pipul frant ke 1, sikkim demkratic frant ke 1, arpiai ke 1, 3 nirdaleey or 3 manonith sadasyon ko milakar kar NDA ke paas 95 saansad hai
 In such a situation, the NDA needs another 28 mps to win the election
 sutron ke anusaar ediemke ke 13, tiares ke 6 or wiesar congress ke 2 sadsy endie ke ummidavaar harivansh ko apana samarthan dene ke liye sahmati de chuke hai
 As of now, NDA candidate Harivansh has the support of 116 mps according to the latest numbers

 com / orei5wmpf7— ANI (@ANI) October 20, 2017 Why are the questions arising that the Election Commission announced the date for the Himachal Pradesh elections last week but the Gujarat election date was not announced
 himachal main ek hi charan main 9 november ko matdaan hoga lekin matganana 18 disambar ko hogi
 The Congress had questioned the difference of 40 days between voting and counting
 mana ja rahaa he ki gujarat main matdaan 18 disambar se pehle hi hoga or donon rajyon main ek hi saath matganana hogi
 The Congress alleges that dates are not being announced in Gujarat to give an opportunity to the government for election promises and announcements
 chunaav ayog kaa tarkmukhya chunaav ayukta achal kumaar jyoti se jab poocha gaya ki parampara ko todate hue ve gujarat or himachal pradesh kaa chunaav kaarykram ek saath ghoshit kyon nahin kar rahe to unka jawaab tha ki donon pradeshon main matganana ek hi din yani 18 disambar ko hogi
 The commission also says that November 9 has been fixed for holding the polling before the snowfall in Himachal Pradesh
 2012 kaa kya he conection!ayog kii ghoshnaa par varisht patrkaar nilanjan mukhopadhyaay ne kaha ki 2012 main april ke pehle hafte main chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan hua tha or himachal or gujarat kaa chunaav kaarykram ek saath ghoshit hua tha
 Voting was held in Himachal on November 4 but the counting of votes took place on December 20
 gujarat main tab do charnon main voting hui thi or 13 va 17 disambar ko vot daale gaye the
 Nilanjan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time
 unhone is baat par nakhushi jaahir kii thi ki lambey chunavi shedul kii vajah se vikaas kaaryon par asar padataa he kyonki chunavi adhisuchana jari rahati he
 PM Modi has been advocating for the 'one Nation, One Election' campaign at this time, he also has the same thinking at its core
 haalanki matganana himachal or gujarat donon kii ek saath 18 disambar ko hogi
 Congress expressed surprise over ec's decision The Congress had expressed surprise at the Election Commission's decision and said that the Commission's decision was beyond comprehension
 agar gujarat main chunaav main deree hogi to satta main jo party he use janata ko lubhaane ke liye aadharahin or gairajaruri loklubhaavan ghoshnaaen karne kaa vakt mil jayega jo chunaav nateezon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 What did the BJP say in defense? However, BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam defended the decision of the Election Commission and said that the elections of the two states cannot be declared together as the session of the Himachal Assembly will end on January 7 while Gujarat on January 21 Will happen
 unhone kaha ki loklubhaavan ghoshnaaen to koi bhi sarkaar pehle bhi kar sakati he
 There is no need to wait for the last days for that
 mahaan ballebaaj viv richards ne sar don bradmen ko khelte nahin dekha lekin maujuuda daur ke tamaam ballebaajon main unhen sachin tendulkar se behatar koi najar nahin aata
 Richards said that i did not see Dan playing, but out of all the batsmen i have seen, there is no one better than Sachin Tendulkar
 unhone kaha ki yadi sachin se behatar koi ballebaaj he to shaayad vah abhi tak nahin aayaa he
 Richards also made Tendulkar better than Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis and Sunil Gavaskar and Javed Miandad of his era
 brandmen ne apane 20 saal ke karier main 52 test main 29 shatak jamaaye the
 Tendulkar has scored 99 international centuries in a career of 22 years
 richards ne kaha ki tendulkar kii sabase badi khubi yah he ki usne dard, naakaami, thakaan or chot se ubarkar karier kaa sarkal puraa kiya he
 Despite this, he is consistently playing well
 vah sampurna package he or sabase zyada sammanit cricketer bhi
 He also defended Tendulkar's decision to stay out of the West Indies tour
 yahaan jaani vaakar ke ek prachaar kaarykram main aaye richards ne kaha ki tendulkar 37 baras kaa he, vah ab pehle kii tarah yuva nahin he, lihaaja uske faisle kaa sammaan karnaa chaiye

 pakistan kii sena sarhad par bunker banane main vyast he
 There are more than 150 km long bonds across the border of Jammu and cement punkers are constantly being built behind them
 lekin, jis tarah se in ilaakon main aatankiyon kii ghuspaith hoti rahi he, use dekh kar lagata he ki kahin in banksron main phogiyon kii jagah aatanki to nahin chhipenge
 Many questions are still unresolved
 What does it mean to build a bunker on the outskirts? kyon seemaa par khadi kii ja rahi he oonchi or lambii diwaar
 Are there any major preparations going on across the border? kya diwaar kii aad main taiyaari kisi khaas makasad kii hogi
 Many such questions are still unresolved
 lekin ankhon ke saamne bahut kuch saaf he
 It is clear that these bunkers are being built to hide
 aam dinon main to yahaan sena hi rahati he
 But it will not be a surprise if terrorists also come here and start hiding
 ye sarhad 180 kilometre lambii he
 The long border stretches from Kathua to Akhnoor in Jammu and Kashmir
 mana jaataa rahaa he ki ye seemaa ghuspaith kaa sabase aasaan rasta he
 Similar incursions have taken place many times before
 bandha kii aad main koi jang kii taiyaari to nahib sawaal ye he ki aakhir pakistan ko jarurat kya pad gai pakke banksron kii
 a bigger question than that is what is meant by the elevated bond
 kahin unke peeche koi sajeesh to nahin rachi jaani he
 This work has gained momentum since the Mumbai attacks
 ab surakshabalon ko bhi is baat kii chintaa he ki banksron kaa istemaal kahin hamale ke liye naa ho
 These constructions were also opposed by the Indian Army, but they did not agree
 pakistan kaa daawa he ki ye mahaj suraksha ke liye hai
 But Indian security forces are also eyeing every action
 ehtiyaat barti ja rahi he ki kahin bandha kii aad main koi jang kii taiyaari to nahin chal rahi he
 It is very important to be vigilant BSF is deployed on most parts of this 200-km long border
 1990 kii shuruyaat se hi is seemaa se ghuspaith hone lagi thi
 From then on, India started fencing on the outskirts
 iske baad saal 2003 se pakistan seemaa main bandha or bunker banaae jane lage
 According to intelligence information, Pakistan has so far built more than 150 kilometers of barrage and several dozen bunkers under their cover
 khufia sutron ke anusaar pakistan main bunker banane kaa kaam chal to pehle se rahaa he
 But during the cease fire, pucca bunkers continued to be built on that side of the outskirts
 jaahir he ye ek aisi he, jise lekar satark rahanaa behad jaruri he
 If people believe in border areas, then fear has become a part of their lives
 wo kehete hai ki kuch baras pehle tak khauf goliyon se tha or ab bandha or bunker ke peeche kya chal rahaa he, iskaa khauf sataata he
 The fear is that if the firing started from across the border, then no one will get the chance to get out of the house
 sijafire kii aad mennai taiyaariyon main laga paksijafire kii aad main pakistan nai taiyaariyon main laga he
 The fear is not just of the Pakistani army
 dar vahaan pal rahe un napak mansoobon se bhi he, jo aatankwaad ko panaah de rahe hai
 Security forces also recognize that many training camps of terror are running across the border
 pakistan main bunker or bandha kaa is tarah khuleam banane kaa kaam tab ho rahaa he, jab donon deshon ke bich sij-fire he
 Don't know what is the motive behind this
 lekin dikhataa saaf-saaf he ki taiyaari joro kii he

 BJP has finalized the name of Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu for the post of Vice President
 lekin aaj se thik dedh maheene pehle jab uparashtrapati chunaav kii sugabugahat hui thi to naidu kaa naam uchhla tha, us vakt naidu ne apane hi andaaj main khabar ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha
 As for the date, when on May 31, when Naidu was questioned about the above-presidential candidacy, he said that he neither wants to become president, nor is he happy to be Usha's husband
 us vakt naidu ne apane chir-parichit andaaj main ummidavaari ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Actually, Usha is the name of Venkaiah's wife and Naayadu had put an end to the news by giving an example of his wife's name
 tab naidu ke alaava loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan, najma hepatullah or sharad yadav sahit kai anya netaaon ke naam res main bataae ja rahe the
 However, just before the announcement of his name on Monday, Naidu said that if the party considers him the name, he will accept the decision of the party
 yahi nahin, us vakt bhi khabaron main venkaiya naidu ke naam par daawa isliye kiya ja rahaa tha ki bijepi dakshin main apnirajnneetik jameentalash rahi he, khaskar andhra pradesh or telugana main
 In such a situation, the party can bet on Naidu
 kyonki naidu in donon rajyon main bijepi kaa ek bada cheharaa hai
 However, BJP has tried to give a message to the people of South India by betting on Naidu

 Earlier, thanks to explosive opener Virender Sehwag's (219) biggest innings in ODI history so far, the Indian team won the toss and scored 418 runs for the loss of five wickets in 50 overs
 ekadivasiy maichon main bharat kaa yah ab tak kaa sabase bada score he
 The Indian team had earlier scored 414 runs for seven wickets against Sri Lanka at Rajkot in 2009
 bhartiya team ekadivasiy maichon main ab tak sarvaadhik chaar baar 400 ranon kaa aankada paar kar chuki he
 India scored 413 runs against Bermuda in 2007 and 401 against South Africa in Gwalior in 2010
 isi match main sachin tendulkar ne naabad 200 ran banaae the
 Apart from Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir contributed 67 and Suresh Raina contributed 55 runs
 sahvaag ne apni 149 gendon kii pari main 25 chauke or saat chauke lagaae
 He demolished Sachin's record of highest individual total of 200 not out against South Africa in Gwalior
 sachin ne apni is pari main 147 gendon par 25 chauke or teen chakke lagaae the
 Sehwag also equaled Sachin's record of hitting the most 25 boundaries in an ODI innings
 vah ekmaatr aise bhartiya cricketer hai, jinhone test maichon main tihara shatak or ekadivasiy maichon main doharaa shatak lagaaya he
 During his brilliant innings, Sehwag also crossed the 8000 runs mark in odis
 gambheer ke saath pari kii shuruyaat karne aae sahvaag ne pehali hi gend ke saath apana rang dikhaanaa shuru kiya or gambheer ke saath pehle wicket ke liye 176 ran jode
 This is the biggest partnership for the first wicket at Holkar
 isse pehle, robin uthppa (86) or rahul dravid ne 2006 main england ke khilaaf is maidan par pehle wicket ke liye 166 ran jode the
 However, Gambhir came out unfortunate after scoring 67 runs off 67 balls with 11 fours but this did not affect the pace of Sehwag's runs
 gambheer ke sthaan par unka saath dene wicket par aae raina ne usee utsaah ke saath sahvaag kaa saath nibhaana shuru kiya, jis utsaah se gambheer nibhaa rahe the
 This was the reason that both took 17 for the second wicket
 3 overo main 140 ran jod daale
 India had added 316 runs till Raina's wicket fell
 is shrinkhalaa main apni naakaami ko dhote hue raina ne 44 gendon par chah chaukon kii madad se 55 ran banaae

 Virat Kohli returned unbeaten 23 runs off 11 balls with the help of three fours

 Will you praise that great India, which is being followed by india-india on every other TV show nowadays
 aakhir ham apane nagarikon ko kab tak aisi zindagi jeene ke liye majaboor karenge
 i have not seen such a number of submerged houses without water
 agar aapako yakeen nahin he to aaj raat 9 baje NDTV india par prime time zarur dekhiegaa
 How people's houses have sunk without water
 naalee or siver nahin daalane ke kaaran barsaat kaa pani jamaa hota gaya
 Year after year, the road kept getting higher due to the laying of the kharanja on it
 itani oonchi ki har ghar kii chat sadak se neeche chali gai yaa itani dub gai ki ab log stool or bench lagaakar apane ghar se baahar nikalate hai
 Houses have drowned down the street, street by street
 makaanon ke doobane ke kaaran ghar barbaad ho gaye hai
 Very few people now have the money to fill the house below and build a house on it
 zyaadaatar log kabadi, tarkari, imarti mazdoor kaa kaam kaam karte hai, rickshaw chalaate hai, to chaat-moongfalee bechakar bhi guzaaraa karte hai
 No voice of such people is heard in this election, but the leaders know their number, so you will see that all the hoardings in Delhi are related to these issues
 magar in muddon kii koi charchaa nahin he
 There is no honest debate
 cement kii saaf-suthri sadak dekhakar aap kahenge ki vikaas ho gaya he, lekin yahi to samajhnaa he
 After all, what development was this, under which it was not thought that by making a road, the door of one's house could be closed, the house could be drowned
 sadak kaa pani ab ghar main girtaa he
 There is no water connection anywhere in the colony
 sabane apane ghar ke aage handpump laga rakhe hai
 The presence of a hand pump in a metropolis like Delhi is telling that our governments are failing to provide water to all
 jahaan handpump laga he, vahiin se naalee kaa pani nikal rahaa he
 The result is that dirty water is going down the ground and coming up from the hand pump
 maine kai auraton ko dekha ki ve baaltee main pani bhar kar do-do ghante intazaar karti hai ki pani kaa ganda hissaa neeche baith jaae, taaki ghar kaa kuch kaam kar saken
 The women walk two or two kilometers to get drinking water
 ilaake main pani bechney ke kai vyapaaree aa gaye hai, magar inhen pani kaa buniyadi adhikaar hasil nahin he
 All the lives of women have been imprisoned around water
 kuch din pehle dakshini dilli kii sanjay gandhi colony gaya tha
 The problem of water there has caused women to tilt the other way
 rasayan ke bade-bade drumon main pani bharaa jaataa he
 Of course, women cannot carry it on their heads, so they have to push the drum down and push it
 ek mahila ne bataaya ki use drum ko dhakke markar ghar tak le jane main kai baar ghanta bhar samay lag jaataa he
 i saw the woman that as soon as she bent down to knock the drum, the motorcycle came from the front
 use khadaa hona padaa, phir kuch dur dhakke dene ke baad koi or saamne aa gaya
 In this way she brought the drum to her house
 isliye hording par naare likh dena - ki sabko makaan milegaa, pani milegaa - paryaapt nahin he

 The mla-councilors and local goons are also forced to live with him due to threats
 inhen pataa he ki is gali se vot kam padaa to makaan tod die jaaenge
 No water will be available from the corporation's tanker
 sirf naare likhakar inke muddon kaa samaadhaan nahin hota he
 The road is built, but due to this the houses are submerged
 ab siver or pani kaa conection dena hoga to saat se aath foot oonchi sadak ko todakar siver line daalani hogi
 All this is a complex task and really needs honest intentions
 kisi bhi sarkaar ko apni praathamikta main ise naaron se aage le janaa hoga
 It is also good for Delhi that ordinary citizens of the capital of India are getting a chance to live a dignified life

 vishaal sikaa ne company ke sansthaapakon ke saath vivaad hone ke baad apane pad se istipha de diya tha
 One of the biggest reasons for Sikka leaving the company was constant attacks from the company's founder Narayana Murthy

 Salil Parekh will hold the post of CEO for 5 years

 For marital success, trusting each other between the couple is very important
 yah bharosa is baat se bhi tay hota he ki shaadi se pehle unke kisi anya se shaareerik sambandh rahe hai yaa nahin
 The trust and love between the couple increases their chances of being uncountable when they stand the test of morality
 ek shodh main yah baat saamne ai he ki shaadi se pehle jin logon ke sexual partner kii taadaad kam hoti he, unke apni patni se sambandh zyada madhur hote hai
 The reason for this is that such people aspire to get more love from their wife and also give more love to them

 The Special Cell of the Delhi Police has busted a module for trading fake currency in the country through the Malda and indo-bangladesh border in West Bengal
 police ne is modul ke ek gurgey ko dilli ke silampur metro stesan ke paas se aath lakh rupee ke jaali noton ke saath giraftaar kiya he
 The shocking thing is that the fake notes found by the person caught by Kamil are all of 2 thousand
 police ne kamil ke paas se do mobile phone bhi baraamad kiye hai
 The Special Cell of Delhi Police had been lying behind Maruz, a resident of Malda, for the past several months
 police ke paas is baat ke pukhta saboot the ki ye shaks bangladesh ke rastejaali notebharat laata he or phir puure desh main apane network ke jariye unhen failaa detaa he
 Kamil, a resident of Kairana in Shamli, also worked for Maruj

 The police team waited for a long time but no one came to take fake notes from Kamil and when Kamil started returning, the police stopped him and searched his bag

 bhartiya cricket team ne 1983 main jab isisi vishwa cap uthaaya puraa desh khushi se jhuumane laga, tabhi is sapane kii neenv padi thi
 i was nine years old at the time and was proud to see my team celebrating on television, sitting miles away
 jab maine cricket khelnaa shuru kiya, tabhi se main vishwa cap ko uthaane kaa sapana dekhtaa or toornament shuru hone ke maheenon pehle se apane ko taiyaar karne main jute jaataa
 The 1996 World Cup was special because we were playing in our country as a co-host tournament
 lekin uske pariktha kii tarah khatm hone kii ummiden srilanka ke khilaaf semi-final main hi bharbarakar dhwast ho gayi
 The road to the hotel that evening seemed too long and we were playing that match again and again in our mind
 yah sochakar pachhataa rahe the ki hamane eden garden kii pich ko pahchaanane main itani badi bhul kaise kar di, jisaki vajah se ham aakhirkaar haar gaye
 The next chance to win the World Cup came in 2003, when the team was filled with passion and passion
 ham australia ke khilaaf mukaable ke liye final ke bade match tak pahunch gaye
 By that time, all the players from the team had seen only others taking part in the World Cup final
 hamaare liye yah jabardast mauka tha
 But once again our decision to bat first proved to be disastrous and Ricky Ponting played his best one-day innings and kept us surrounded by his bat
 phir 2007 kii niraashaa ke baad 2011 kaa vishwa cap bharat main khelaa gaya or iskaa final match mumbai main hua, jo hameshaa mere liye khaas rahegaa
 Our preparations actually started long before the tournament
 is taiyaari main bahut choti-choti chijen bhi shaamil thim, jaise harek ke liye 3 kilo vajan kam karne or is tarah zyada chust-durust team banane kaa vaada
 Everyone lived up to this promise
 maine apana 3
 i lost 8 kg and my teammates also completed their goals
 main maanata hum ki cap uthaane kaa sapana maine jarur dekha tha, lekin maine kalpana bhi nahin kii thi ki jeet ke jashn kis tarah ke honge! yah aisi shandaar raat thi, jo isse pehle bharat ne sirf ek baar or dekhi thi—kya aadmi, kya auraten, sab kaaron ke upar chadhakar naach rahe the or koi etraj bhi nahin kar rahaa tha
 i remember my dancing as a child after India's victory in the 1983 World Cup
 is hafte se bhartiya team apana vishwa cap khitaab bachaane kaa abhiyaan shuru karegi
 They will be in the fray against their traditional rival Pakistan and calling it a pressure match will be an understatement! The start of the World Cup against Pakistan will be a new experience for many players of the team
 ahm mukaable main achche dhang se banaai gai yojanaon main bhi tabdili kerani pad sakati he
 In 2003, Veeru (virender Sehwag) and i had decided to open the innings as opener and also decided that either of us would play till the end
 maine pehle strike lee taaki vakaar (younus), wasim (akram) or shoeb (akhtar) kii tihari chunauti ko nestnabud kar sakuun
 The interesting thing is that this did not happen and we went on scoring runs at a fast pace
 duusari pari main team kii body language badal gai or ham zyada aakraamak ho gaye
 It has been an interesting feature of all the matches played between India and Pakistan, ever since i first faced them in the 1992 World Cup
 yah match hameshaa kiran more or javed miyandad ke us mashhoor jhagade ke liye yaad kiya jayega, jisamen miyandad ne more ko daraane or chillaakar gendbaajon ko aage kii naseehat dene se rokane ke liye vah mashhoor mendhak kud lagaai thi! vishwa cap ke aagaaj ke baad se yah pehla mauka tha, jab donon timen is toornament main ek duusare ke khilaaf khel rahi thim, or bharat ne aage aane vaale kai or muqablon kaa yah pehla match jeet liya
 In the 1996 game, tensions in the field reached an all-time high after Venky's (venkat Prasad) clash with Aamir Sohail
 yah match bhi bharat ke liye mithi yaad tha, jisamen navjot siddhu ne 93 ranon kii majboot pari kheli or phir ajay jadeja ne 25 gendon par 45 ran banaakar bharat ko 50 overon main 287 par pahunchaa diya
 This match will be most remembered for Sohail's dismissal at the hands of Venky, especially because Sohail had spoken badly to Venky while waving his bat towards the boundary
 is ghatana or phir sohail kaa wicket lene ke baad puri team jabardast harakat main aa gai or hamane match ko apni mutthi main jakad liya
 Then something similar happened in England in the 1999 World Cup
 yahaan hamane super sicks mukaable main pakistan ke khilaaf match khelaa
 In this, Venky once again took 5 wickets and we won the match by 47 runs
 2011 kii jeet bhi bahut khaas thi, kyonki is jeet main puri team ne milakar yogadan diya or jahir ne apane ek shandaar spel main bahut ahm wicket chatkaaye
 The clash between Omar Gul and Veeru was also vigorous, when we batted first and in the second innings, all our bowlers made a great contribution and dismissed Pakistan
 main pehle se kah saktaa hum ki 15 farvari ko bahut kadaa muqabla hoga, kyonki is mukaable main kuch na kuch aisa jarur he, jo donon tiimon ko apana behtareen pradarshan karne par majaboor kar detaa he, khaskar agar warm-ap match main pakistan ke pradarshan ko sanket maane, to aisa hona or bhi tay he
 The Indian team will be under such tremendous pressure that it cannot even be imagined; It will be the first match of the tournament and there is a long history between the two neighboring countries on and off the field
 lekin bharat ke openar match ke alaava bhi is vishwa cap main kuch or shandaar mukaable honge, jinhen dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 In this World Cup, all eyes will be on anyone, if they are the most
 bi
 De Villiers is the same
 dakshin africa vah team he, jo apni haal kii form kaa is baar puraa phayda uthaanaa chaahegi
 Critics have been accusing him of some irrational accusations
 is toornament main kamyaabi ne bharat ko kai maukon par chakaaya he, lekin dakshin africa ne hameshaa sabhi vishwa kapon main kamobesh adbhut cricket khelaa he, chaahe vah 1992 main kepler vesal kii team ho yaa 2011 main gram smith kii, or ab di williars main netritv main khilne vaali team ho
 i expect New Zealand, England and South Africa to be in advantage over other teams, as they will be playing on their well-known wickets
 lekin tamaam tiimon main main samajhataa hum ki dakshin africa hi vah team he, jis par nigaah rakhni hogi (australia ke alaava), kyonki ve bahut acha cricket khel rahe hai or unke paas ol-round kaabiliyat vaale kuch bahut achche khilaadi hai
 India has similar players in Asian countries
 haalanki beete do maheenon main unhen australian paristhitiyon main kaaphi jujhna padaa, lekin phir bhi unhen puri tarah khaarij nahin karnaa chahie
 i know the fact that as captain M
 es
 Dhoni and his enthusiastic players have the mysterious ability to turn things around and learn a lesson fast from their defeat
 baaki asian tiimon main, mujhe puraa bharosa he ki srilanka bahut acha pradarshan karegi
 i understand that having (kumar) Sangakkara and (tillakaratne) Dilshan gives a dangerous edge to any team
 pichley hi maheene ve newjiland ke daure par the, yah baat bhi unke abhiyaan ke liye ahm hogi
 Cricket lovers have a lot of expectations from India and they would expect the team to win every match in the World Cup
 main mahaj itani ummid karuunga ki team is tajurbe kaa majaa le, apni jaan ladaa de or khel par hi apana puraa dhyaan lagaae; phir jeet to khud-ba-khud unke peeche chali aegi
 The dream of the World Cup is something that does not disappear from the eyes of a cricketer until he becomes part of the winning team
 lekin main unhen sirf yahi salaah duungaa ki khel kaa bharpoor majaa uthaaen, or dil kholkar khelen, maahaul kii garmi ko khud par haaavee na hone den or kinhin bhi halaat main khel kaa majaa kirkira na hone den
 i would say that the team should enjoy the experience, give their life and focus on the game, then the victory will follow them
 ayodhya sadbhaavna samanvay samiti ke adhyaksh amarnath mishra dwaara ol india muslim personal laa board ke sadsy rahe salmaan nadvi par ram mandir ko lekar deal karne ke aarope par shri shri ravishankar kii ore se bayaan jari hua he
 It has been clarified in this statement that Amarnath Mishra is neither a representative of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar nor is associated with his organization
 art of living ne apane bayaan main saaf kiya he ki amarnath mishra shri shri ravishankar ke pratinidhi nahin hai
 According to the statement issued, the Art of Living has said that we welcome everyone with an open heart and take everyone along
 jo koi ayodhya masale ko shanti purvak sulajhane main sahyog karnaa chahta he, sanstha uskaa swaagat karti he
 Gurudev (sri Sri Ravi Shankar) wants to resolve this by involving all parties
 prarambh se hi hamaara rukh bilkul spasht he
 According to Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the Ayodhya dispute outside the court will have to be resolved "amicably, not by deal or conflict"
 desh kii ekta or shanti ke liye yah mahatvapurn he ki is vishay ko donon samudaay ke log saath baithkar aapasi bhaichaare ke maahaul main sulajhaayen
 It is a matter of great regret that some vested selfish elements are putting all kinds of maneuvers to thwart this good initiative and to create mistrust
 amarnath mishra ne salmaan nadvi par aarope lagaaya tha ki unhone ram janmabhumi ko lekar ek deal karne kii baat kahi he
 In which he sought 5000 crores and 200 acres of land in Ayodhya
 haalanki, nadvi ne in tamaam aaropon ko bebuniyaad bataaya tha or kaha tha ki unhone aisi koi deal kii baat nahin kahi he
 Sakshi Maharaj also said that the allegations of Amarnath Mishra were baseless and asked Shri Sri Ravi Shankar to come forward and tell the truth
 art of living kii taraf se jari bayaan main shri shri ravishankar ne amarnath mishra se pallaa jhaadte hue kaha ki vah naa to unke pratinidhi hai or naa hi unki sanstha se koi vaasta he
 Diamond can be extracted from coal at any time
 basharte, iske liye iraade hon
 Willingness to work
 mehnat karne kaa madda ho aurrfasaron ko faisle lene kii chhot ho
 There is no scope for doubt in this because the evidence has been found
 yaad kiijie
 When the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had said that the auction of Kikoyele mines to the government at least 1
 86 lakh karod rupye kaa nuksaan hua he to khub hallaa machaa tha
 This is done when the UPA 2 government was at the center
 tab sarkaar ke mantriyon ne to kaig ke daawey ko badha chadha kar bataaya hua aankada qaraar diya tha
 Can coal also give benefits like gold? a small team of Central Government officials has shown this to be true
 kitna or kise phayda?kendra sarkaar ne koyale ke khadaanon kii nilaamee se ab tak do lakh karod rupee ugaahe hai
 The proceeds came from the auction of 30 coal blocks
 roylty ko chhodkar sarkaar ne kul 1
 76 lakh crores have been raised
 koyale kii nilaamee se mili ye raashi or roylty chah rajyon ko de di jaaegi
 How was the success? Union Minister of State for Coal Piyush Goyal entrusted the responsibility of this task to Coal Secretary Anil Swarup and then a nominated authority was formed
 is kaam ke liye mantralay ke sabase junior adhikari vivek bharadwaj ko chunaa gaya
 Joint Secretary Bhardwaj took SK Shahi, the officer of the Central Secretariat, as a director in the authority, as well as temporarily joining two employees from Coal India
 mahaj chaar logon kii is team ne paanch maheene se bhi kam vakt main adhyadesh banane se lekar nilaamee tak kaa kaam to kiya hi, court main chal rahe 15-20 maamalon main sarkaar kaa paksh bhi rakhaa
 The biggest thing is that none of them took a single day off during this period
 kya he phaayde kii kahani?pichley saal sitambar main supreme court ne 214 kol block nirast kar diye or maheene bhar ke andar hi sarkaar adhyadesh lekar aa gai
 This team of officers took five days to prepare this ordinance
 cabinet dwaara adhyadesh paarit kiye jane ke kareeb dedh maheene baad hi adhyadesh kii puri niyamavali taiyaar kar lee gai
 This was a big challenge for the officers, the work was also difficult because the e-auction of coal blocks was being done for the first time in the country

 The speech of Prime Minister Modi, who usually gave long lectures, ended in 38 minutes and the story remained confined to Kashmir
 gaahe-bagaahe jammu or ladakh kaa zikr to aayaa lekin is dauraan na to wo hinduon ko majboot karne kaa naaraa dete nazar aae or na hi kashmiri panditon ke punarvaas kaa mudda uthaate
 The heroes of his speech were also Kashmiri, the examples were also Kashmiri and the reference was also Kashmiri
 kootneeti or raajnneeti ke lihaaj se dekhen to modi kaa bhaashan na to bharat bhar main faile apane prashansakon ke liye tha or na hi deshavaasiyon ke liye
 The Prime Minister did not even name Pakistan or Pakistani activities in India
 modi darasal is bhaashan ke zarie kashmiri avam or vishwa samudaay, donon ko saadhane kii koshish kar rahe the
 At least that was the message
 vishwa samudaay or kashmir ke liye modi ke bhaashan main do sandesh the
 Both are appreciated words on the world stage - development and democracy
 modi apane bhaashan main yaa to loktantr ko majboot karne, nai raajnneetik peedi taiyaar karne or tarah-tarah ke chunaavon par jor dete rahe or yaa phir vikaas ke swapn sansar main logon ko bhavishya kii chhaviyaan dikhaane kii koshish karte nazar aae
 Both of these things are positive because it has jobs, better living standards, macroeconomic, better resources and business, stronger democracy and a call for people's participation
 lekin aisa nahin he ki modi kii yah ranneeti bilkul nai hi he
 This is a tested formula of Modi, so far it has been successful and at least he hopes that it will be proved right in the case of Kashmir too
 modi kaa rambaan formulamodi kaa yah formula pichley kuch varshon kii raajnneeti ke varak palatakar samajha ja saktaa he
 The concept is straightforward
 jis bhi rajya main apane pair jamaane hon, pehle vahaan ke raajnneetik varchasv or sabase majboot dikh rahe raajnneetik gharaanon ko pahachaano
 Then in addition to their limited population of ethnic and community power, connect the rest with the slogan of opportunity, power and equality
 is tarah pehle se bani lakiron ke samaanaantar badi lakeer khinchakar modi abhi tak jeet par jeet sadhate aae hai
 If you want to understand by example, then look at Uttar Pradesh
 mayawati jatvon kii raajnneetik pahchaan hai
 At the same time, Akhilesh Yadav is the successor of the MY (muslim-yadav) equation
 lekin baaki jatiyon main inaki paith simit rahi
 Modi unified the dominance of these regional parties by integrating the remaining small castes
 yahaan parivaarwaad or jatvaad yaa sampradaay vishesh ke tushtikaran ko modi pehali lakeer ke khilaaf istemaal karke apane paale main bahumat jutate aae hai
 This is the situation in Bihar based on Lalu Prasad's caste-based politics
 unka emwai sameekaran bhi rajya kii raajnneeti kii ek badi lakeer tha jise modi ne unase badi lakeer khinchakar chota sabit kar diya he
 It is believed that in Haryana politics, apart from Jats, a single plant of paddy cannot be planted
 lekin rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav se lekar do loksabhaa chunaavon tak jis tareeke se jat or jat raajnneeti ke jame-jamaaye parivaar haashie par daal die gaye, wo modi ke is formule se hi sambhav ho sakaa he
 This has happened not only with political opposition but also with organizations associated with BJP
 shivasena se behatar udhaaharan iske liye kya ho saktaa he
 Today, Shiv Sena's clamor is less towards the NCP or Congress, more to the threat from the BJP
 aglaa daanv kashmir menour ab baari he kashmir kii
 Modi was seen doing the most in his speech and trying to placate the majority population by rising above any caste, sect or regional identity
 modi ne na to kashmiri panditon kaa zikr kiya or na hi hindu musalmaan yaa buddha or sikhon kaa
 They brought jobs, business opportunities, world-class tourism, cinema and food, stipends and recruitments for everyone
 unhone rajya ke karmchaariyon or police ko kendriya karmchaariyon ke baraabar laane kaa khwab dikhaaya
 The future of youth, better living standards for families, opportunities in politics for the most limited in the power of two families were included in this dream picture of Modi
 modi bhaashan main vikaas ke ye saare bimb gadhate hue satta par dashakon se kabiz pariwaron ko gherte bhi rahe
 The intention is clear, to draw a long line from the line of these political families and to marginalize them on the page of politics of Jammu and Kashmir
 lambii lakeeren logon ko bhaati hai
 They start seeing better fortune in lines
 lekin kashmir main lakeer keval pariwaron main jakadi raajnneeti kii hi nahin he
 People have streak in their hearts because they have to suffer deep wounds
 modi apni ranneeti se bhale hi kshetreey raajnneeti ke gharaanon kii lakeeren choti kar len, lekin kashmiriyon ke dilon kii lakeeren lambii hai or yahaan sawaal usase aage nikal paane kaa nahin he, use mitaa paane kaa he
 This is perhaps the second biggest challenge in Modi's political life

 Theo was castigated and beaten to death
 theo kaa ilaaj kar rahe doctor ne bataaya ki jab theo ko aspataal laayaa gaya tha to vah puri tarah khun se lathpath tha
 According to the doctor, Theo has suffered serious injuries throughout his body
 theo caprivet part(guda) main bhi bahut chotein hai
 Significantly, several human rights organizations have also stood up against the atrocities with Theo in France and are demanding strict action against the accused police officers

 How can this unilateral relationship be called friendship? Seeking the Prime Minister's intervention on Raju's statement, Karunanidhi said that two Sri Lankan officers undergoing training at Wellington in Tamil Nadu should be deported and no Sri Lankan defense personnel should be trained here
 dramuk pramukh ne tamilnadu main virodh ke baavjood srilankai rakshakarmiyon ke prashikshan ko jari rakhane ke liye samprag sarkaar kii aalochana kii or kaha ki bharat ko turant hi aise abhyaas band karne chahie
 Karunanidhi raised the question by saying, how can India tell Sri Lanka its friend, while China is providing him six times more help than India
 is ekapaksheeya sambandh ko dosti kaise kaha ja saktaa he? raju ke bayaan par pradhanmantri ke hastkshep kii maang karte hue karunanidhi ne kaha ki tamilnadu ke wellington main prashikshan praapt kar rahe do srilankai afasaron ko waapas bheja janaa chahie or yahaan srilanka ke kisi rakshakarmi kaa prashikshan nahin hona chahie
 The DMK chief criticized the UPA government for continuing the training of Sri Lankan defense personnel despite protests in Tamil Nadu and said India should stop such exercises immediately

 All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi has targeted the Modi government over the economic downturn
 ovaisi ne centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue shanivaar ko twit kar kaha ki bijepi kii flip-flop policy he, jiskaa phayda bade kaarobaariyon ke alaava kisi ko nahin ho rahaa he
 Asaduddin Owaisi wrote in the tweet, instead of dealing with the slowdown in the economy, the government is following a flip-flop policy that benefits no one except big businesses
 bijepi sarkaar ko sirf us vakt kaam karte dekhte hai jab wo vibhaajankaree muddon par baat karti he
 Earlier, Owaisi advised the Supreme Court's decision on the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid land dispute to be rejected as a 'victory of faith over facts' and rejected the proposal of giving 5 acres of land for the construction of the mosque
 yahi nahin, shuukravaar ko unhone twit kar kaha ki mujhe apni masjid waapas chahie
 After the verdict on the Ayodhya case, Owaisi quoted former Chief Justice JS Verma's statement as saying, "the Supreme Court is virtually supreme
 
 
 
 And the last, but it can also be a mistake
 yah tathyon ke upar aasthaa kii jeet vaala faisla he
 The Supreme Court said in its ruling that the Center should provide 5 acres of land to the Muslim side as an alternative to the construction of the mosque
 is par ovaisi ne kaha ki muslim paksh kanoonee adhikaar ke liye lard rahaa tha or kisi se bhi daan kii jarurat nahin he
 He said that it is his personal opinion that the proposal to give 5 acres of land to the Muslim side should be rejected
 unhone twit kar kaha, 'main akhil bhartiya muslim personal laa board ke rukh kaa samarthan karata hum

 (also from input IANS) (input ieenes se bhi) In the cabinet, the NCP will get 14 and the Congress will get 12 ministerial posts, with the Chief Minister in the account of Shiv Sena, 14 ministers have cleared the way to form a Shiv Sena-led non-bjp government in Bhima Maharashtra
 shivasena-congress or ensipi ke bich sarkaar banane ke liye lagbhag sahmati ban gai he
 However, the picture of who among the Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and Aditya Thackeray will become the Chief Minister is not yet clear
 haalanki shivasena ne aditya thakare ko aage kar chunaav ladaa tha, lekin ab sthiti badal gai he
 After the end of the relationship with the BJP, the Shiv Sena is now forming a government with political parties like its anti-congress and NCP
 sharad pavaar jaise rajaneta ke saath samanjasy baitaakar sarkaar chalaanaa or bijepi jaise majboot vipaksh ko sadhana nae siem ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 There is a continuous discussion between the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP to form a consensus Maharashtra government
 teenon dalon ke bich kaaman minimum program (siempi) ko lekar sahmati ban rahi he
 Under this formula, Shiv Sena will get the chief minister's post for the entire term, while the Congress and NCP will have one deputy CM each
 iske alaava mantrimandal main ensipi ko 14, congress ko 12 mantri pad milenge
 In addition to the Chief Minister's post, 14 ministerial posts have been agreed on in Shiv Sena's account
 maharashtra main shivasena, congress or ensipi ke bich sarkaar banane kaa formula tay ho gaya he
 Along with this, it is also decided to become the Chief Minister from the 'thackeray family', but doubts have now been formed on the name
 sawaal ye he ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare khud satta kii kaman sanbhaalenge yaa phir thakare parivaar kii teesri peedi ke rup main aditya ke naam par hi siem pad ke liye muhar lagegi?shivasena ne aditya thakare ke naam par vidhansabha chunaav ladaa tha
 In view of this, Aditya contested from Worli Assembly seat in Mumbai and won the MLA
 chunaav nattejey aane ke baad siem pad ke liye shivasena bijepi ke saath 25 saal puraane naate ko todakar congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane ja rahi he
 In such a situation, it seems difficult for the Congress and NCP to agree to make Aditya Thackeray the CM
 aditya thakare ke saamne bhi hogi chunautiensipi pramukh sharad pavaar or congress ke diggaj va anbhavi netaaon ke saath gathbandhan sarkaar chalaanaa aditya thakare ke liye aasaan nahin hoga
 That too when a strong opposition like BJP will be in front of them
 udhar, centre main narendra modi kii sarkaar he, jisase shivasena pehle hi baahar aa chuki he
 In such a situation, the path ahead can be very challenging for Aditya Thackeray who has just made his debut in politics
 yahi vajah he ki shivasena aditya thakare kii jagah uddhav thakare ko siem banane kaa daanv chal sakati he
 Uddhav Thackeray can run the government better with allies, he also knows how to deal with strong opposition like BJP
 haalanki yahaan bhi ek pench he
 If Uddhav becomes CM, the BJP will get a chance to raise the question that they have broken the alliance by coming to their own political longing
 yahi nahin, yah pehali baar hoga ki jab thakare parivaar king mekar kii bhoomika chhodkar sidhe satta par kabiz hoga
 In such a situation, the Opposition will directly attack the Thackeray family, this may reduce the status of the Thackeray family and Matoshri, on which the Shiv Sena politics runs
 yahi vajah he ki maharashtra kaa aglaa mukhyamantri koun hoga? ise lekar raajnneetik vishleshak pakke taur par kuch bhi kah paane kii sthiti main nahin hai
 Aamir Khan has become a victim of restlessness these days, to get rid of this, he is resorting to smoking
 bollywoodlife
 According to the news published in com, the film 'dangal' is the reason for Aamir Khan's restlessness
 ji haa aapane sahi suna lekin aamir khan jaise sulajhe hue actor nervas hon yah baat kuch hajam nahin hui
 But according to sources on the site, this happens to Aamir every time his film is about to release
 apni har film ke relies se pehale vah nervas rahane lagate hai
 This also happened to him during 'dhoom 3', 'PK' and the film 'talaash'
 aamir khan ne aakhri baar smoking is saal janvari main chodi thi jiske baad unhone 25 kilo vajan bhi kam kiya or 'dangal' ke liye apni body ko shape main bhi lekar aae
 Abamir's film Dangal is going through a pre-release phase and his nervousness is increasing
 is bechaini ne unhen puri tarah se smoker bana diya he jiske chalate vah naa jane kitni hi cigarette phoonk rahe hai
 Puffing several times a day
 aamir khansirf bete aaazaad ke saamne cigarette pine se parhez karte hai kyonki aaazaad ko paap aamir kaa cigrat pinaa bilkul pasand nahin
 According to sources, whenever Aamir smokes, Azad asks him to leave the room
 'dangal'ko lekar aamir khan kii nervasness kii ek vajahsalamaan khanbhi maane ja rahe hai
 Because this year, based on Salman Khan's wrestling, the film 'sultan' proved to be a blockbuster hit
 film ne kamai ke maamle main pike ko chhodkar sabhi filmon ke record tod die the
 Therefore, there is a lot of discussion about the comparison of 'dangal' and 'sultan'
 sabhi ke jahan main yahi sawaal he ki kya aamir kii resler kii jindagi par besd film kya box aphis par salmaan kii sultan ko maat de paaegi
 Somewhere all these discussions are the reason for Aamir's restlessness

 According to a proposal by the BJP government of Maharashtra, the ordinance making such an arrangement ended on December 23 itself
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra kii pichhali congress-ensipi sarkaar ne chunaav se thik pehle musalamaanon ko sarkari naukari main 5 fisadi aarakshan kaa adhyadesh paas kiya tha
 In June last year, the previous Maharashtra government approved 16 percent reservation for Marathas and 5 percent for Muslims
 yah faisla aise samay main kiya gaya tha jab chaar maheene baad 15 oktober ko pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav hone the
 On 14 November 2014, the Bombay High Court stayed the decision to apply Maratha reservation in jobs and education
 court ne musalamaanon ko naukariyon main paanch fisadi aarakshan ke faisle par bhi ste laga diya tha or sirf shaikshik sansthaanon main musalamaanon ke rigerveshan kii anumati di thi
 The Maharashtra government went to the Supreme Court against this decision, but the top court refused to interfere in the case and directed to hear the Bombay High Court itself

 unhone kaha ki abhi na na to garibi rekha ke maapdand par sarkaar main ek raay he, na na sabhi garibon ke bank khate khule hai or na hi sabake aadhaar card bane hai
 He said that it is clear that the real purpose of the Congress-led government is not to convey their rightful rights to the poor, but to make political gains in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ne kaha, congress is yojana ko ‘game changer (khel palatney vaala) bataa rahi he
 He feels that only by making it half incomplete, people will forget things like inflation, corruption, scams and misconduct with women etc
 and vote in his favor
