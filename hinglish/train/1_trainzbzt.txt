 This film may get less attention because the budget of the film is small

 Gradually he grew up and started learning dance
 aaj kalyaan kai skool or college main nrity sikhaata he
 Kalyan has made films with inspiration from crores of children like him
 duniyaan ko yah bataane ke liye ki kya hota he dard un bacchon kaa, jo anaath hote hai
 Many such children have also worked in this film, who have spent their childhood on footpaths
 kalyaan ne film ko produs karne ke saath-saath acting bhi kii he
 Apart from these, Dharmendra Singh, Sebatina Reddy, Neha Bansal, Pooja Mahatre, Shantanu Bakshi, Mushtaq Khan, Raza Murad, Ramesh Goyal, Ali Khan and Birbal have played roles in the film

 Whatever the film may be, Kalyan's effort is commendable, who has not only tried to touch the sky from the ground, but has also tried to inspire Yatim and the destitute children through his life and his film

 dilachasp baat ye he ki tarik anwar ne ghar vaapasi karte hue congress ke tikat par baaji ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 Tariq Anwar, who has been a total of five times MP from Katihar seat, has left the Nationalist Congress Party and joined the electoral fray with Congress
 haalanki, congress se unka naata sabase purana he
 Born on 16 January 1951 in Patna, the capital of Bihar, Tariq Anwar had entered the field of politics at an early age
 wo shuruaati dinon se hi congress kii raajnneeti karne lage the
 At the age of just 25, Tariq Anwar became the president of Bihar Pradesh Youth Congress
 ye wo vakt tha jab puure desh main indira gandhi ke netritv vaali congress ke khilaaf tamaam siyaasi suurama ekajute ho gaye the or desh ko apatkaal kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The battle of Jagannath Mishra and Sitaram Kesari in Bihar gave Tariq Anwar a big opportunity
 donon diggajon ke bich tarik anwar ne seetaram kesari kaa saath diya or dilli main jab congress (indira) kaa gathan hua to seetaram kesari ko koshadhyaksh banaaya gaya
 It was here that Tariq Anwar's political journey got taken care of
 haalanki, isse pehle unhone patrakarita ke kshetra main bhi apana yogadan diya
 Tariq Anwar is survived by his wife Hina, four daughters and a son
 unhone apane kariyar kii shuruyaat bataur patrkaar kii
 Tariq Anwar brought out the weekly tabloid newspaper in Hindi from Patna, which ran from 1972 to 1974
 iske baad wo 1974 se 1982 tak 'yuvak dhara' ke sampadak rahe
 In 1976, Tariq Anwaria, a traveling traveler, became president of the Bihar Youth Brigade of Indira Gandhi Congress in 1976
 1981 tak wo is pad par rahe
 He was then President of All India Youth Congress from 1982 to 1985

 Meanwhile, he continued to contest the Lok Sabha elections as well
 tarik anwar ne pehla loksabhaa chunaav 1985 main katihaar seat se hi jeeta
 After this, he was an MP from 1987-1988
 1996 or 1998 main phir wo katihaar seat se saansad nirvaachit hue
 In 1999, Tariq Anwar made a big decision and left the Congress party

 Tariq Anwar returned home from the Congress in 1999 over the issue of Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin and Tariq Anwar, who formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) along with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, returned home in October 2018 and Rahul Gandhi gave him Welcomes Congress
 tarik anwar ne rafel mudde par sharad pavaar ke bayaan ko aadhaar banaate hue ensipi se istipha diya tha
 He had said that the stance the NCP has expressed on Rafael is not correct

 Now Tariq Anwar faces Dulal Chandra Goswami of Janata Dal (united)
 jabaki nesanalist congress party ke tikat par is baar mohammad shakur chunaav lard rahe hai

 Sleeping on duty is not allowed
 lekin phir jab 'aaj tak' ne upi police kii is neend kii asaliyat tatoli to ahsaas hua ki ye soen nahin to kya karen? 12 ghante kii jagah 24-24 ghante duty, chhuttiyon kaa ata-pataa nahin, suvidha, ghar-parivaar, tyohaar se koson dur
 ak-47's fight against sticks and chase criminals on bicycles
 kya kabhi kisi ne sochaa he ki khaaki vardi ke peeche bhi to vahi haad-maance kaa insaan he

 'aaj Tak' showed many policemen of UP sleeping on duty, what showed snoring while sleeping, there was a lot of uproar
 logon ne upi police kaa khub majaak udaaya, yahaan tak ki rajya ke police mukhiya ne aanan-fanan main kah daalaa ki jo so rahe the unke khilaaf sakht karrwai hogi
 41 thousand posts of soldiers in UP, 70 percent of the vacant state is ill, suffering from mental stress

 The police station incharge is on 24-hour duty throughout the year
 rajya ke pachaas hajaar sipaahi kii duty sirf nau hajaar puri kar rahe hai, kyonki sipaahiyon ke 41 hajaar pad khaali hai
 Police is probably the only force in the country that remains the most targeted
 aisa nahin he ki army yaa paramilitary force par kabhi kotahi, kaamchori, karpshan yaa duusari tarah ke iljaam nahin lage hon

 The total population of the state is 200 million, while in such a large state, the number of policemen is only 2
5 lakh
 sanyukt raashtra sangh keantararashtriya maapdandki baat karen to kisi bhi desh main ek lakh logon par kam se kam 222 pulisavaale to hone hi chahie
 Obviously, this is not the case in UP, although the UP government itself has set the criteria for its state to have at least 158 policemen on 1 lakh people instead of 222
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki soobe main 1 lakh logon par par sirf 67 pulisavaale hai
 Rather, there are many of them who are engaged in units like VIP duty, Investigation, court action, Reserve Force and Intelligence Department

 rus ke ek vimaan ne 233 logon ko lekar udaan bhari
 Just took off that suddenly a flock of birds collides with the plane
 plane ke donon ingine ko baari nuksaan pahunchataa he
 Obviously, the aircraft could not fly in such a situation
 plane airport par bhi waapas nahin ja saktaa tha
 Now the pilot had only two routes left
 ek plane ko krash hone de
 Second, make one last effort to save the lives of passengers in the aircraft
 payalat ne doosraa rasta chunaa
 However, this route was also very dangerous
 magar or koi chaara bhi nahin tha
 15 August 2019 Moscow, Russia: Now Ural Airlines aircraft Airbus 321 took off from Zukowski Airport to Crimea Ferropole with 233 passengers and crew members
 vimaan abhi hawa main paravaaz bhar hi rahaa tha ki achaanak pakshiyon kaa ek jhund uskaa takaraa jaataa he
 Birds were trapped in both aircraft engines
 jiske vajah se vimaan ke ingine hi band ho gaye
 However, the aircraft was still just a few kilometers from Zukowski Airport
 lihaaza payalat ne vimaan ko waapas airport par land karne ke liye ghuma to diya
 But due to the engine shutdown, it was not dangerous for him to reach the airport
 kyonki daanv par 233 zindagiyaan lagi huin thi
 So the pilot of the plane, Damir Yusupov, decided to land the plane in a corn field just one km before the airport
 ural airlines ke vimaan airbas 321 main safar kar rahe ek musafir ne kuch tasviren apane camere se lee hai
 Before landing, the aircraft is going up at an extremely high speed of hundreds of km from the ground
 to kabhi neeche aa rahaa he
 Because the pilot was also afraid that one of his lapses could not make it to the lives of 233 people present in the aircraft
 koi bhi andaaza nahin laga saktaa he ki us vimaan main baitha koi bhi shaks batch saktaa he
 But miracles were yet to happen in Moscow's fields
 kyonki ab aap jo sunne ja rahe hai, us par yakeen karnaa thodaa mushkil hoga
 After hovering very close to the ground for a long time, the pilot of the aircraft finally landed the Airbus 321 in the corn fields
 vimaan main achaanak khalabali much gai
 Because in this bumpy field, the aircraft began to eat hiccups
 dar bas is baat kaa tha ki kahin vimaan aag naa pakad le
 And not all the pilgrims can get away with his offering
 magar yakeen maniye chamatkaar ho gaya
 The Russian plane, which came down from the height of hundreds of miles with 233 people, remained safe even after landing in the maize field and saved 233 lives
 kehete hai jako raakhe saaiyaan maar sake na koy
 This saying was proving true in the fields of Moscow
 ye chamatkaar hi tha ki itnaa bada vimaan haadasa hone ke baad bhi vimaan main baitha har yatri surakshit tha
 The bus received minor scratches to 23 passengers, including five children
 jinhen airport par hi ilaaj ke baad fouran chhod diya gaya
 Let us now tell you how this whole accident happened
 darasal, ural airlines ke vimaan e 321 ne moscow ke jukovski airport se udaan bhari
 The aircraft had 226 passengers and 7 crew members
 techoff ke turant baad vimaan pakshiyon se takaraa gaya
 After a while the aircraft started moving very fast
 isaki vajah se vimaan ke ingine main aag lag gai
 The aircraft engine stopped and it was impossible to take it back
 payalat ke paas koi rasta nahin bachaa tha
 The plane was scheduled to crash
 andar baithe musafiron kii jaan halak main aa gai
 The alarm inside the plane was a scream
 kyonki panchhiyon ke fanse hone kii vajah se ingine main aag lagi hui thi
 And people were able to see the burning engine clearly
 vimaan kii daahine taraf kii liten jalane lageen or kuch jalane kii badboo lagaataar aa rahi thi
 But even after seeing death, the pilot did not lose heart and decided to make an emergency landing
 payalat ne vimaan ko masco airport waapas le jane ke bajaae usase ek kimi pehle hi makke ke ek khet main utaar diya
 As soon as the plane landed in the fields, the passengers started getting off the plane
 har kisi ko dar tha ki kahin vimaan main visphot na ho jaae
 However, emergency doors were opened shortly after Landingh and passengers were evacuated one by one
 is haadase kii khabar jaise hi media ke zarie logon ko lagi
 Everyone was surprised
 or vimaan kii chamatkaari landing ke baad rus main payalat daamir usupov hero ban gaye
 He was given a wave of congratulations
 yakeenan usupov kii sooyeeboojh se hi vimaan main maujuud 233 logon kii jaan batch saki
 Because usually after the engine of the aircraft is stopped, there is a lot of possibility of the plane crashing to come down from such a height and it is almost impossible to save anyone in such accidents
 or is baar bhi aisa hi hua
 Death was in front but luck was with these passengers
 bas ek chamatkaar ne 233 yatriyon kii jaan bachaa lee

 Anil Kumble, who was elected as the coach last year, had to resign from the post of coach of Team India despite a successful tenure within just one year
 pichley ek saal main anil kumble ke coach banane se lekar ravi shastri kii dobaaraa bhartiya team ke coach ke rup main vaapasi ke bich kaaphi kuch ho gaya, jiske bare main ham aapako bataanaa chaahate hai
 Let's take a look at all those controversies 1
 shastri par baari pade anil kumbelepichley saal 2016 main bharat kii mejabani main khele gaye tii20 world cap ke baad ravi shastri kaa kaa team diarector ke rup main kaarykaal khatm ho gaya tha
 After which he again applied for the post of coach of Team India
 18 maheene tak team india ke diarector rahe ravi shastri coach pad kii daud main tab tak sabase aage the jab tak is daud main anil kumble nahin shaamil hue the
 But as soon as Kumble came, the contest turned against Shastri vs Kumble and the name was named after Kumble
 2
 Saurav Ganguly did Shastri interview the applicants for the coach position in front of the out-of-the-box committee, besides Kumble and Shastri, Lalchand Rajput, Praveen Amre and Tom Moody
 in aavedakon kaa intervyuu salaakaar samiti main shaamil sachin tendulkar, vivies lakshmana or saurav ganguli ne liya
 In the absence of Ganguly, Shastri was interviewed by two other members of the Consultative Committee, Sachin and VVS Laxman along with BCCI Secretary Sanjay Jagdale
 shastri or kumble ke mudde par salaahkaar samiti ekamat nahin thi
 Except Ganguly, the rest of the members felt that Shastri, who had done a good job in the post of Director of Team India for 18 months, needed a strong reason for not choosing for the post of coach
 lekin ganguli hameshaa se anil kumble ke paksh main rahe or aakhirkaar kumble hi team india ke nae coach chune gaye
 3
 shastri kaa ganguli par hamalaajab kumble ne shastri kii jagah lee to unhone saurav ganguli par apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Ganguly was one of the three cricketers who became the reason for his removal
 shastri ne aarope lagaaya ki intervyuu ke dauraan jab unki baari ai to wo maujuud nahin the
 On the other hand, Ganguly criticized Shastri for not personally meeting the CAC
 ganguli ke mutabik jis samay coach kaa intervyuu tha us dauraan shastri honkong main chhuttiyaan bitaa rahe the

 shandaar rahaa kumble kaa report cardcoch banate hi anil kumble kii kaman main team india ne westeindies ke khilaaf test siries main shandaar pradarshan kiya or siries 2-0 se jiti
 He then won 3–0 over New Zealand in the domestic test series
 vahiin vanade siries main bhi team india ke kiviyon ko 3-2 se maat di
 The strong England team which came on the tour of India also defeated India 4–0 in the dust as well as in the ODI and T20 series 2–1
 ab baari thi australia kii usamen bhi kumble best sabit hue unke netritv main team india ne kangarooon ko 2-1 se post kar diya

 kumble-kohli vivaad kii shuruyatviraat kohli or anil kumble main matbhed australia ke khilaaf siries se shuru hua
 This dispute occurred during Dharamshala Test
 ranchi test main chotil hue captain viraat kohli dharmashala test main khilne ke liye feet nahin the
 Ajinkya Rahane was the captain of the team
 is match main chinamen gendbaaj kuldeep yadav ko mauka diya gaya tha
 Kohli was against it, he wanted to feed Amit Mishra
 media reports ke anusaar, kuldeep yadav ko khilaane or plaing ilevan par faisla viraat ko bina bataae liya gaya tha 
 Apart from this, Virat Kohli was also upset with the inclusion of former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in grade-a
 jiske baad kohli or kumble main daraar padane lagi
 Apart from this, coach Kumble was very strict about discipline in Team India
 kai maukon par vah practice ke dauraan khilaadiyon ko latad bhi laga chuke the
 At the same time, he was also against the girlfriends and wives of the team players on several rounds
 jiske baad donon main vivaad or bad gaya
 6
 bisisiai ne mangavaaye coach pad ke aavedanbisisiai ne ipel 10 ke dauraan coach ke pad ke liye aavedan mangavaaye
 This gave an indication to Anil Kumble that his current term ending after the Champions Trophy would not be extended
 bisisiai kii is ghoshnaa se spasht ho gaya ki aalaa adhikari bataur coach kumble ke pradarshan se khush nahin the
 The reason behind this is that he adopted a very aggressive attitude towards the players' central contract and increase in their salary
 7
 Anil Kumble's resignation Anil Kumble resigned as coach after growing differences with Kohli and defeat to Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final
 kumble ke bina hi team india westeindies daure ke liye ravaanaa ho gai thi
 After which Anil Kumble also gave the reason for this by tweeting, he wrote that the BCCI told him that the captain of the team was having trouble with his style of work

 do hafte pehle ek press conference hui jisamen akhilesh yadav or mayawati ne phulon ke gucchhon ke peeche se kaha ki jo biit gaya wo biit gaya or ab ve us aitihaasik gathbandhan ke liye vachanabaddh hai jiskaa parinaam rajantik rup se faldaayi pradesh he
 Mayawati is not one to forgive those forgetting things and she clearly stated in that press conference that what Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party workers did at the guest house in 1995 was the culmination of lowliness in Indian politics
 mayawati or akhilesh yadav va unke pita mulaayam singh yadav ke bich kaa itihaas kaaphi pechida rahaa he lekin un baton ko kabhi saajha nahin kiya gaya
 In 2002, Mayawati sat in the business class of a flight going to Delhi
 tabhi 29 varshiya akhilesh yadav kii flite main entry hui jinhone bataur saansad apana pehla chunaav jeeta hi tha
 He was accompanied by his wife Dimple Yadav
 unhone mukhyamantri ko namaste kiya
 Mayawati, who is often criticized as arrogant, did not recognize both, and did not respond
 18 saalon tak mayawati ke suraksha adhikari rahe padam singh ne uske baad jo hua uske bare main bataaya
 "after landing in Delhi, sister-in-law asked me about the young couple
 mujhe 1995 kaa guest house cond yaad tha jab samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakartaaon ne mayawati par hamalaa kar diya tha, to maine laaparvaahee se kah diya ki ve donon mulaayam singh ji ke bete-bahu akhilesh or dimple yadav hai
 She became angry and said, "why didn't you tell me? You should have told me quietly
" unke bete-bahu ne mujhe namaste kiya or mujhe bhi sahi se unka abhivadan karnaa chahie tha
 You did not tell me anything about it
 wo ladkaa mere bare main kya soch rahaa hoga? uski patni kya soch rahi hogi? yah sahi nahin hua
 "then Padam Singh faced the other side
 "mayawati ji ko chhodane ke baad jab main apana saamaan uthaane aayaa to akhilesh ji bhi apane saamaan kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 i knew him since i worked with his father
 unhone mujhase kaha, "padam singh ji agar bahan ji or ham haath mila len to ham milakar is desh par shashan kar sakate hai
 But ironically, despite being so powerful, we are both out of power
 "ek saal baad phir padam singh kaa saamana ek duusari flite main kuch aisi hi sthiti se hua- mayawati ko dilli janaa tha or is baar unke bodyguard dehshat main the kyonki unke bagal vaali seat sabase bade pratidwandi mulaayam singh yadav ke liye rigerv thi
 Padam Singh says, "we had to beg either one to change seats
 maine samaajawaadee party ke ek netaa se baat kar use is baat ke liye manaa liya ki netaji pehle plane main baith jaaen
 Then i brought sister to her seat, which was towards the corridor
 ankhon ke sampark se bachane ke liye netaji akhbaar padhate rahe
 Both did not even look at each other
 ham sab unhen hi dekh rahe the
 When the plane reached Delhi, both Mulayam Singh and sister ji stood up and came across each other on the corridor
 netaa ji ne jhat se haath jodakar "namaste bahan ji" kaha
 i liked this feeling very much
 yahi nahin unhone jor dekar kaha, "bahan ji aap pehle utren
 "but Mayawati said," No, no! If your seat is ahead of us, go first
 " padam singh daawa karte hue kehete hai ki mulaayam singh ne bada sammaan dikhaate hue kaha, "bahan ji, aap meri bahan hai
 You will go first, you are older than me

 Padam Singh says that when the BJP proposed a coalition in front of him in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2003, he rejected it because he was told that he would get only 20 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP

 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat has created another new controversy with his comments
 unhone kaha he ki pati kii dekhbhaal ke liye mahila uske saath ek qaraar se bandhi hoti he
 a few days ago, he raised controversy by saying that incidents like rape do not take place in rural India, but in urban India
 bhagwat ne shanivaar ko indore main ek raily main kaha, pati or patni ke bich ek qaraar hota he, jiske tahat pati kaa yah kahana hota he ki tumhen mere ghar kii dekhbhaal kerani chahie or main tumhaari sabhi jaruraton kaa dhyaan rakhuunga
 He said, this is how the husband follows the rules of the agreement
 jab tak patni qaraar kaa paalan karti he, pati uske saath rahata he
 If the wife violates the agreement, he may abandon her
 tippaniyan Reacting strongly to Bhagwat's comment, CPI (M) leader Brinda Karat said, "I don't find it surprising, after all, he is from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
" main sochati hum ki yah bharat kii pichhadi soch vaali 'samiti' he
 These are the same elements who wanted a new Constitution of India on the basis of 'manusmriti' during the bjp's reign
 isliye ve jab bhi is bhashaa main baat karte hai, to ve sirf apni vichaardhaara darshaate hai
 RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav said that Bhagwat's views about marriage are being misrepresented in the Indian perspective
 unhone kaha, unke vichaaron ko puri tarah galat dhang se pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He (bhagwat) had said that the Western matrimonial system is a covenant, where men and women consider marriage as an agreement, whereas what he (bhagwat) meant was that the Indian marriage system is a very sacred institution
 kuch din pehle unhone yah kahkar vivaad khadaa kiya tha ki balaatkaar jaisi ghatnaayen gramin bharat main nahin, balki shahari bharat main hoti hai
 Bhagwat said at a rally in Indore on Saturday, "there is an agreement between husband and wife, under which the husband says that you should take care of my house and i will take care of all your needs
" unhone kaha, is tarah pati qaraar ke niyamon kaa paalan karata he
 As long as the wife follows the agreement, the husband stays with her
 yadi patni qaraar kaa ulanghan karti he, to vah use tyaag saktaa he
 The comments bhagwat kii tippanee par kadi pratikriya vyakt karte hue makapa netaa brunda karaat ne kaha, mujhe yah ascharyajanak nahin lagata, kyonki aakhirkaar vah rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se hi hai

 ye vahi tatv hai, jo bijepi ke shasankaal main 'manusmriti' ke aadhaar par bharat kaa nayaa samvidhan chaahate the
 So whenever they speak in this language, they only show their ideology
 aresas pravaktaa ram madhav ne kaha ki vivaah ke bare main bhagwat ke vichaaron ko bhartiya pariprekshya main puri tarah galat dhang se pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 He said, his views are being misrepresented completely
 unhone (bhagwat) kaha tha ki pashchimi vaivaahik vyavastha ek qaraar hoti he, jahaan stri-purush shaadi ko ek samjhaute ke rup main maanate hai, jabaki unke (bhagwat) kehane kaa matlab yah tha ki bhartiya vivaah vyavastha bahut hi pavitra sanstha he

 According to the company, 'since its arrival in the market on 27 April 2013, more than 10 million phones have been sold
 'gallexi S3 ne 1 karod kii bikri kaa aankada chune ke liye 50 din kaa samay liya tha
 Before that Samsung's Galaxy S2 touched this figure in 5 months and Glaxy s in 7 months

 Meanwhile, there are also discussions that soon the company S5 may also launch in the market, whose features will be more advanced than S4

 In the history of smartphones, this is a phone that was eagerly awaited
 Galaxy S4 kii kyon hui duniya divanisamsung ke liye yah uske saphaltam utpaadon main se ek he or company ne phone ke states ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uski marketingmein koi kor-kasar nahin chodi
 However, despite the flamboyance and glamor, they are the features of the Galaxy S4, which have won a lot of praise from customers

 Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma called the late former President Dr
 apije abdul kalam ko lekar aisa bayaan diya ki ab us par siyaasi paara garam ho chukaa he
 In the program 'sidhi Baat' till date, he had said that Kalam was a great nationalist 'despite being a Muslim'
 kendriya mantrisharma ne haal hi main desh ko ‘saanskrithik pradooshan’ se mukt karaane or vidhyaarthiyon ko mahabharat tathaa ramayana padhaane kii baat kahi thi
 "we changed the name of Aurangzeb Road to a person who was a great nationalist even" despite being a Muslim
 ’mahesh sharmaake is bayaan ke baad vipakshi dalon ne sisaayat tej kar di he
 Indeed, Sharma's statement comes against the backdrop of the controversy arising out of the resignation of Mahesh Rangarajan, director of the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML)
 congress kaa aarope he ki sarkaar kii ore se asahneeya dabaav kii vajah se rangarajan ne istipha diya
 Owaisi questioned the statement, MIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi questioned this statement of Sharma and said that the statement of the Union Minister reflects the intention of the government
 unhone kaha, pradhanmantri narendra modi is baat kaa jawaab den kya unke mantri jo kuch bhi bol rahe hai, vah unke bhi man kii baat he? ovaisi ne yah bhi sawaal kiya ki kya mahesh sharma yah kahana chaahate hai ki desh main basane vaale musalmaan rashtrabhakt nahin hai?bataa den ki nai dilli nagarpalika parishad (endiemasi) ne 28 agast ko lutiuns dilli main sthit aurangzeb road kaa naam badalakar apije abdul kalam road karne kii manjuuri di thi
 Indian law has been treating rape of a male's genitalia in the vagina without a woman's consent or against her will for nearly one hundred and fifty years
 yon utpeeda ke tamaam duusare roopon masalan sharir ke kisi or hisse main purush jananaang ke pravesh ko balaatkaar nahin mana jaataa rahaa he
 The focus of the rape law has been to control a woman's sexuality, not to protect her physical autonomy and dignity
 is tarah vah kanoon balaatkaar ko bardaasht karne kii jameen taiyaar karata tha
 But this view changed with the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 2013
 nayaa kanoon ab kisi mahila kii sahmati yaa ichha ke viruddh uske sharir ke kisi hisse (yoni, gudadwar yaa koi anya) main purush jananaang, ungali yaa kisi anya vastu ko kisi bhi tarah se ghusaane ko balaatkaar maanata he
 Not only this, if the victim is under the custody or influence of the accused or trusts him then the crime becomes more serious
 isliye yah kanoon nai paribhaasha gadhata he or yon hinsa ke bare main saamaanya nazariye ko chunauti detaa he
 Tarun Tejpal's counsel Geeta Luthra argued that the law under which the applicant is to be arrested is very strict
 ’’ jawaab main nyaayadhish prabhudesai ne tippanee kii, ‘‘aparaadh kii prakruti
 
 
 
 gender se sambandhit he’’ or ‘‘uskaa peedit ke jati, dharm, nasl yaa uski saamaajik-rajnatik-vittiya haisiyat se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 "in other words, rape is the man's favorite way of proving his primacy
" purush sex kii kuntha ke kaaran nahin balki apni vaasana kii tripti ke liye balaatkaar karte hai
 Judge Prabhudesai admitted that social beliefs were impaired and forced to hide rape complaints
 is myne main nayaa kanoon beraham hone kii bajaae un manyataon or yon hinsa ko bardaasht karne ke nazariye ko chunauti detaa he
 The judge also said, "the law, which is being described as merciless, is actually designed to curb the unreasonable increase in such crimes
" ’’is tarah se purush jananaang ke balaat pravesh se sambandhit har prakaar kii sex hinsa ko samaaj ke khilaaf aparaadh (balki sangyeya aparaadh) maanakar purush pradhan samaaj ke arth badal die gaye hai
 Also how much society will tolerate
 adaalat ne yah bhi mana ki saamaajik kalank kii dharna kii vajah se peeditaayen balaatkaar jaise shabd jabaan par laane se bachati hai
 There is no fault of the victim in rape, yet he is blamed for encouraging rape
 duusare shabdon main kahen to balaatkaar ko lekar samaaj main prachlit dharanaon ke chalate kai peeditaayen shikaayat karne se hichakati hai yaa unke saath jo hua, use balaatkaar kehane se bachati hai
 Rape victims often refrain from calling themselves permanent victims or seeing rape as death
 log bhi balaatkaar peeditaaon ko ek alag grah ke praani kii tarah dekhne lagate hai
 The victim is often seen with pity or considered characterless
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaali peedita ko or bhi sex hinsa ke yogya maan liya jaataa he
 When women journalists do research on rape in relation to their work, write reports on it and narrate it to their editors, the person is risking sexual feelings
 balaatkaar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane vaali yaa shodh karne vaali mahilaon ke khud sex sambandhi utpeeda yaa balaatkaar tak kaa shikaar ho jane kii kahaniyaan anjaani nahin hai
 Allegations against such women of acting in a disrespectful manner are leveled, they are considered characterless or provoking their work
 isliye nyaayadhish prabhudesai ne faisla sunaaya, ‘‘uplabdh saamagree se pehali najar main yah pataa chalata he ki aavedak ne apane kriyalap se, jise vah halke-phulke mood main hua bataata he, peedita ko apamaanit, kalankit kiya
 "the court, while denying anticipatory bail, argued," The objective of women-sensitive laws can only be achieved by the correct implementation of the law and the detailed investigation of such crimes
 
 
 or isamen hiraasat main poochtacha bhi jaruri he
 "the court also has to see whether the accused helps in the police interrogation, and whether the detention period is sufficient for interrogation? The court is also sensitive to the possibility of mental or physical harassment by the police during the interrogation in custody
" Therefore, Tejpal's lawyers have been allowed to meet him
 isse hamen yah yaad dilaayaa gaya ki aaropee ke adhikaar bhi ahm hai, khaskar jab maamle ke raajnneetikaran yaa sansanikhej banane ke saboot mil chuke hon
 Activities such as throwing black cloth on the accused or smearing soot on the nameplate of the house of his accomplice have been seen, which represent the mob
 yah bheedtantr ham dilli ke charchit gangrape maamle main bhi dekh chuke hai
 People were not surprised by the death of one of his accused in custody
 aitihaasik rup se yahi bheedtantr mahilaon ke adhikaron kaa bhi virdohi rahaa he
 Therefore such acts certainly do not represent or support the victim's struggle for justice
 stri ko nyaay ke naam par nishpaksh sunwaayee ke adarsh ko chhod dene kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati
 If we want to change the world, we cannot allow sex violence to become the arena of politics, it should be a matter of justice

 If the government officials arrived from Jaipur, then the viscera of birds have been sent for investigation
 jaanch report aane ke baad hi pakshiyon kii maut ke kaaran kaa khulaasa ho paaegaa
 Local people said that about 5 to 8 thousand birds have died here, while the local administration said that about 1,500 birds have died
 sthaneey logon ne kaha ki unhone aisa najaara ajtak nahin dekha
 Local bird lover Abhinav Vaishnav said that he comes to see birds every day
 lekin ajtak kabhi is tarah vakya uske saamne nahin aayaa
 25-year-old Abhinav Vaishnav told that like every day when he reached the lake, he saw that some embossed things are floating around in the lake

 After this, when the three of us investigated, it was found that birds have died all around Sambhar Lake

 It is being speculated that some poisonous chemical has been transported to the lake in some way or something has reached the lake, which is killing the lifeless birds

 For Maruti, the issue of employees was more troubling in recent years than market and policy fluctuations

 But the question is, how did Maruti transform itself amid a slowing economy and worsening situation? She was not happy when Mayank Parikh, the marketing and sales COO of Maruthi leave, asked his wife to take a two-year leave
 asal main ye chuttee naukari se nahin, balki ghar ke kaam se thi
 Parikh had understood that his company Maruti needed all his energy in preparation for facing the slowing economy

 He has gained all this information by throwing dust on the roads

 To counter the rising interest rates, he found customers who do not want to buy a car by taking loans

 Most of these suggestions were about trivialities, such as Rs 7,34,000 to the supplier every year for sealing company leak test machines

 singh kehete hai ki karigar samaj gaye hai ki agar unhen rahanaa he, to laagat kam or quality behtareen rakhni hogi
 But what if they had other intentions, such as during the agitation in Manesar in 2011 and 2012, what would happen? There was no problem of artisans in the satisfied Shramikudgaon factory for nearly 14 years
 manesar kaa kissa kuch alag he
 His company was also different - Suzuki Powertrain India
 2012-13 main iskaa maaruti main vilay ho gaya
 The company had its own system of recruitment through two external agencies
 karigar kiraye kii choti jagah main, akasar ek kamare main chaar, rahete the or kaam ke baad karne ko kuch nahin tha
 In Manesar, the proportion of artisans recruited through contractors was very high
 kuch anumaanon ke mutabik yah 50 pratishat se zyada tha
 Most were young and in a hurry to conform to the ambition of their generation
 gudgaanv main sthiti alag he
 Many artisans have been working here for more than twenty years
 unhen apni vardi par garv he, kyonki gaanv main rutaba bad jaataa he
 In Gurgaon, a large number of old employees keep the youth under control, and tells them that your time will also come
 manesar main puraane karmchaariyon kaa aisa asar nahin tha
 But to some extent now
 gudgaanv se aise kareeb 150 varisht karmchaaree chune gaye, jo manesar factory ke paas rahete the or unka tabadalaa vahiin kar diya gaya
 Yet the average age of 4,800 employees in Manesar is 29 years, while in Gurgaon it is an average of 35 years out of 7,200 employees
 chairman bhargav kaa kahana he ki or bhi bahut kuch ho rahaa he, ‘‘hamane bahari bhartee companiyon or thekedaaron se mukti paa lee he
 Back to Gurgaon system is adopted
 ab ham puri jaanch karte hai ki candidet kahaan se aa rahaa he, uskaa parivaar kaisaa he
 They are first placed aprentices and are monitored throughout the year
 uske baad aprentis ko pariksha deni padati he or do saal ke liye train ke taur par bhartee kii jaati he
 The most important thing is their perspective
 ’’kuch bhartee nae system ke tahat kii ja rahi he
 Some artisans are laid off as demand decreases

 When the demand increases, the person who is fired last will come back first
 niyamit karmchaariyon kii sabhi riktiyaan inhen logon main se bhari jaaengi
 Bhargava says that the intention behind this is to keep them engaged and inspire them to become regular employees
 kul sthaayee karmchaariyon main se kareeb 30 pratishat nai vyavastha ke tahat aaenge
 On an average, the same goes up and down in demand
 bhargav kaa kahana he ki badakismati se hamaare kanoon main asthaayee karmchaariyon ko rakhane kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 We want flexibility in terms of employees, as the demand varies
 log theke par karmchaaree rakhte hai or uskaa galat istemaal hota he
 We do not want to recruit and remove
 ham asthaayee karmchaaree chaahate hai
 We also want social security to be in place in India
 kuch or companiyaan bhi yahi vyavastha apnaane lagi hai
 In the first decade and a half of its existence, Maruti built houses for employees in Chakrapur and Bhondsi villages around the factory
 2,000 se zyada makaan banawaye gaye or jinke maalik karmchaaree hai
 The company now wants to bring this system back
 haryana sarkaar se bhawan nirmaan kanoonon main dheel kii baat chal rahi he, taaki chote flats vaali oonchi imaaraten badi sankhya main banaai ja saken

 Actually, there is a discussion on social media about Urmila Matondkar that after marriage she changed her name and religion
 aapako bataa den ki saal 2016 main urmila matondkar ne mohsin akhtar mir se shaadi kii thi
 Mohsin is 9 years younger than Urmila
 # urmilamatondkar herself should clear the doubt raised by people regarding her name being changed post marriage
 It's her absolute right to do that
 But if she has, then why has that name not been used in the nomination form? @rahulgandhi@milinddeorahala hi main urmila (urmila Matondkar) ne apane personal instagram acount par mandir main baithe hue ek photo share kii thi
 There he wrote that i have been braved

 to vahiin kuch logon kaa kahana he ki yah dharm sabha sarkaar or supreme court par dabaav banane ke liye he, taaki ve ram mandir ko lekar jald faisla len
 Since the devotees from all over the country have gathered in this Dharma Sabha, the culture of different parts of the country is also seen in it
 jisamen log dhol majira lekar pahunche hai or apane ilaake ke lok geet ke saath bhagwaan ram ke prati apni bhakthi jataa rahe hai

 vah ladkaa arunachal pradesh kaa tha
 His eyes were slightly smaller
 naak chapati thi
 The hair was somewhat different from stylish
 lekin uske angon kii banaavat majaak udaane or phir use peet petakar maar daalane ke liye paryaapt thi
 Nido Taniyam used to study in college
 nai umr kaa ladkaa
 a shopkeeper in Lajpatnagar first rubbed his hair
 nido ko gussa aayaa to usne dukaan kaa kaanch tod diya
 The police took him to the police station, got the shopkeeper a compensation of Rs 10,000 and then left him back at Lajpat Nagar Market
 bhare baithe the dukandaar
 Nido was attacked with a pole and rod
 lahu kaa jaayaka kaisaa he yah dilli bataati he
 Munawvar's lion was not like this, but today i feel like reading it
 dilli ne bataa diya
 Killed him by killing him
 ho saktaa he aage kuch or tathy saamne aaen, par ab tak ghatana kaa yahi byora mila he
 Wants to be filled with anger
 agar aap dilliwaale hai to tay kiijie ki kaise riect karenge
 Will it or not? Stop playing Candy Crush, take two minutes to read these questions, whose answers are probably lost in a galaxy
 5 din pehle isi dilli ke centre main 26 janvari manaate hue hamane gaaya, 'jhanda ooncha rahe hamaara' or 'i mere vatan ke logon'
 Whose country are these people from? Those who killed which country
 jo mara vah kis vatan kaa tha? 84 main bhi koi mara tha, 2002 main bhi bahut mare the
 Do you see similarity? How should the flag remain high in such a situation? The victorious world tricolor
 yah kiski 26 janvari he? yah kiskaa 15 agast he? main poochna chahta hum
 There are seven states in the northeast of the country
 seven sisters
 Seven stepsisters of Delhi
 kya unki he 26 janvari? yah sirf siyaasi masalaa nahin he
 Whether you believe it or not, it is a glimpse of the racial hatred that is deeply ingrained in your mind
 ekta main akhandta? kya majaak karte hai sahab! aapako to ve chinis najar aate hai? bhaichara? phaltu kii baat he
 You have kept special addresses and jumle strongholds for them
 peeth peeche nahin, saamne chilla chillaakar bolte hai aap
 Modern India? all nonsense
 varanaa north east kii ladakiyon ko dekhakar zyaadaatar maukon par aap ek hi kism ke khyaalon se kyon bhar jate
 The thoughts that are soaked in the mud of lust and those go to heinous crimes like extreme rape and violence
 north east kii mahilaon ke kapadon or chehron main aap uksaava khoj lete hai
 Why do you think most of them come here to become prostitutes? Why are you hesitant to give them a house on rent? And then some angry resident of the North East, call you 'U Indians', then your vice-nationalism swells up
 deshadrohi, bahari, algaavvaadi, na jane koun-koun se tamge baant dete ho lage haath
 When Delhi is written as 'rape capital', your arms start bursting
 koi tathakthith bahari dilli main adhikaar se rahata he to tumhaare seene main jalan hone lagati he
 So let's make different colonies in Delhi
 ek main upi-bihar vaale rahenge, ek main north-east vaale, ek main musalmaan, ek main sikh, ek main mahilaayein
 And then to make Delhi a little elite
 jab koi kisi kaam se duusare ke ilaake main jayega to baanh par baij lagaakar jayega, jis par uskaa dharm, jati, kshetra, ling likhaa hoga taaki uski mukhtaliff pahchaan sanad rahe
 Let's welcome Hitlership
 i dilli, tu bataa ki tere paas fakhr karne ke liye kya he? chaar-chah aitihaasik imaaraten, puraane khandhar? yaa teri chaati par uga hua wo gol sansad bhawan? mal, metro, bahan kii gaali, kya? kis baat par itnaa abhimaan he tuje? koun sa rahasyamayi dambh he tuje, pataa to chale?kya koi vijay jolly ab puure lajpatnagar ko kaalikh se rangane jayega? kya karenge ve log jo mombatiyaan lekar india get pahunche the pichhali baar? ve jinhone seene par pani kii taqatvar bauchhaarein jheli thim ek murda ho chuki anjaan ladki ke liye? kya karenge hamaare pratinidhi, hamaare netagan, tivi channelon par ekaadh bite dene ke sivaa? koi modi yaa rahul apane bhaashan main nido taniam naam ke us bhartiya ko yaad karegaa? scindia kisko kahenge yeda? koi enjio vaala bhi sud legaa yaa nahi? mere in sawaalon kaa jawaab diya jaae
 All this happened in the area of lajpat Nagar Police Station
 us thane ke kshetra main jo baaki thanon ke liye adarsh bataaya jaataa he
 Said not, Bassi sir! Who has right over Delhi? Is there anything like first right and second right? Everyone claims dilli vaale bhi, gujarat vaale bhi
 Yesterday the Bengalis also went away by asserting their rights
 haq koun tay karegaa? dilli waalon kaa pasandida jumala he, 'tu jaanata nahin, meraa baap koun he?' police vaala pakad legaa to chaalaan nahin bharenge, baap kii dhauns denge
 Today, i want to ask, 'who is your father who is Delhi?' Before anyone's poisonous tongue comes into action and says outrageously, let me tell that i too am a resident of Delhi and am embarrassed to the extent of this
 notebandi ke baad bhale hi logon ko ghanton line main khadaa hona pade lekin aajkal soshal media par ek aisi tasviir viral ho rahi he jo ki aapke hosh uda degi
 In this picture, this person is seen making a bed of 2000 notes and resting on it
 iske saath shaks ke haath main sone kii chaiyn or bracelate bhi dikhaai de rahaa he
 However, who is this person and where did the money come from, remains a question
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) October 7, 2017 namaskara, main raveesh kumaar, bas chalata to chunaav ayog se pehle nattejey bataa detaa
 i tried very hard to tell the number that is going to come
 agsit pole ne aise aise number diye ki samaj hi nahin aayaa ki algebra kii koching karun yaa calculas kii
 Someone or the other will be right
 maine bhi ek number kuch logon ko bataaya, lekin jab se agsit pole aae hai sab mujhe khoj rahe hai
 We have clearly said that if the exit poll people repeatedly go wrong and come back again and again with their number, then why should i flee to Mumbai for fear of being wrong
 to aap sab jinako lagata he ki ye number aayega enditivi india ke twitor handle @ndtvindia par bhejiye
 How much number will NDA get and how many number will come to the Grand Alliance
 dhyaan rahe agsit pole se prabhavit hokar apane number na bhejein
 The comments ek mushkil chunaav he ye
 Whoever wins will not get victory by placing it on the plate
 donon pakshon ne ghanghor ladaai kii he
 Whoever has tried the strategy
 kisi ne gaay khol di to kisi ne sarso mircha kaa havan bhi kar liya
 The election started from the package went on Pakistan and the talk of governance started with the cow
 diene kii baat hote hote brahampishaach or narbhakshi kii hone lagi
 But the level of our electoral politics is the same, our leaders retained it in terms of language level as well
 ladaai aisi thi ki chunaav se pehle nattejey bataa dene waalon kii jamaat se kamazor dil vaale pehle hi bhaag khadey hue
 If nothing is found, there is a collision of thorns
 jitegaa to koi ek hi
 This was also an unexpected election in the case of rallies and meetings
 bijepi ne apane dal bal ke saath khub ladaai ladi he
 Many of its leaders are claiming to hold hundred meetings
 mahagathbandhan ne bhi wo sabakuch kiya jo karnaa chahie tha
 He did not have an army of activists and strategists like the BJP, yet his fight at times was heavy on the BJP
 helicopter ke payalton ne bihar khub dekha hoga
