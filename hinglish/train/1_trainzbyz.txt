 kuldeep-chahal has not been selected in two consecutive T20 series Chahar- Sundar is trying out players like Kohli Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal may not have got a chance with the national team in T20 cricket in the current season, but experts believe It is too early to believe that they have been paid in the shortest format of the game before next year's World Cup
 pichley 24 maheenon main prabhavi pradarshan se simit overon kii team main jagah pakki karne vaale kuldeep or chahal ko lagaataar do tii-20 siries ke liye bhartiya team main jagah nahin di gai, jisamen dakshin africa ke khilaaf maujuuda gharelu siries bhi shaamil he
 Prior to the first T20 in Dharamsala, Indian captain Virat Kohli said that he is trying players like Rahul Chahar and Washington Sundar, because they want to have more depth in batting and consistently score more than 200
 bharat ke purv salaami ballebaaj akaash chopra ne kuldeep or chahal ko baahar rakhane ke faisle ke sandarbh main kaha, ‘iske peeche vichaar yah he ki agar ballebaaji main gaharaai he to aap nishchit tareeke se ballebaaji kar sakate hai
 But with such depth you cannot play in the traditional way
 england ne aisa hi kiya
 He focused on depth in batting as he wanted to score 400 runs (in odis) and he achieved it many times
 ’akaash chopra ne kaha, ‘aisa lagata he ki bharat tii-20 main isi tarah kaa aakraamak ravaiya apnaanaa chahta he or isamen kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Now he has to show the will to score 220 consecutive runs
 ’ chopra ne kaha, ‘aathven, nauven or 10wein number tak ballebaaji kaaphi mahatvakankshi he (kyonki shaayad 20 overon ke match main aapako isaki jarurat hi nahin pade), lekin agar aap 220 ran banane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai to thik he
 Chopra believes that if a team wants to compromise its ability to take wickets, then it will have to score more runs
 is purv bhartiya salaami ballebaaj kaa maananaa he ki chahal jald hi tii-20 main vaapasi karenge
 Chahal is currently only part of the one-day international team, while Kuldeep is involved in both the 50-over format and the Test match, but he is not scheduled to play in the playing XI
 chopra ne kaha, ‘chahal vaapasi karenge
 Rahul Chahar is a bowler and Washington Sundar might not need batting at number eight
 ’ purv bhartiya spinner or ab spin coach sunil joshi ne yuvaaon ko aajamaane ke kadam kaa swaagat kiya, lekin saath hi chetaya ki aisi sthiti spinneron ke man main bhram paidaa kar sakati he
 Joshi said, 'I would suggest that Kuldeep and Chahal play domestic cricket when they are not part of the national team
 yahaan ungali ke spinner yaa kalai ke spinner kaa sawaal nahin he
 It is a strategy to manipulate the batsmen
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘‘dekhte hai ki yuva spinner kaisaa karte hai or unhen paryaapt maukey die jane chahie, lekin saath hi agar chahal or kuldeep sirf ek praaroop main khelte hai to unki lay bighad sakati he
 White ball cricket is completely dependent on rhythm

 bhartiya team ke record ko dekhen to 2017 main viraat ko captaini milane ke baad se kul 18 vanade maichon main se team ne 13 jite, 4 haare or 1 match benatija rahaa
 In these matches, India have scored an average of 6 runs per over
 in maichon main 7 baar bharat ne 300 se zyada kaa score banaaya or pehle ballebaazi karte hue 6 puure hue maichon main se 5 baar 300 se bada lakshya vipakshi team ko diya
 On the other hand, the Australia team won 4 of the 10 matches played in 2017, losing 4 and losing 2
 aise main bhartiya team kii lay ko bhartiya zameen par rokna, vah bhi tab jab michel stark, joush hezalwood or aron finch jaise khilaadi team kaa hissaa nahin hai, is kangaroo team ke liye behad mushkil hoga
 Looking at the record of the Indian team, since the captaincy of Virat in 2017, the team has won 13, 4 defeats and 1 match out of a total of 18 odis
 in maichon main bharat ne ausatan 6 ran prati over se ran banaae hai
 In these matches, 7 times India scored more than 300 and batting first gave the target to the opposition team more than 300 out of 6 completed matches
 duusari ore, australia team ne 2017 main khele 10 maichon main se 4 jite , 4 haare or 2 benatija rahe
 In such a situation, it will be very difficult for the Kangaroo team to stop the rhythm of the Indian team on the Indian soil, even when players like Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Aaron Finch are not part of the team
 congress ne arun jetali ko salaah di he ki 'naarad muni mat banie balki vitt mantri banie
 The Congress comment came on Jaitley's statement that the Congress leadership, not the Congress party, is responsible for the deadlock in Parliament
 vittamantri par congress or iske netritv ke bich daraar paidaa karne ke prayaas kaa aarope lagaate hue party netaa jairam ramesh ne kaha ki aisa isliye kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki jetali ne 'aarthik sthiti par puri tarah niyantran kho diya he
 In a press conference, he said, "jaitley has become Narada Muni instead of being the Finance Minister
 unhen naarad muni bananaa band karnaa chahie or vitt mantri bananaa chahie
 According to beliefs, Narada Muni used to travel all over the world and take the story from one place to another, which caused tension
 tippaniyan Ramesh said that there is no difference between the Congress party and its leadership
 unhone kaha, 'vitt mantri bhram paidaa kar rahe hai ki congress netritv or congress donon alag-alag hai
 He claimed that the finance minister is 'anxious and restless' after facing serious allegations in the DDCA scam
 unhone aarope lagaae, 'pradhanmantri besharmi se vyaktigat jansampark abhiyaan main lage hai or vitt mantri arthvyavastha sambhaal nahin paa rahe hai
 "he is not developing, exports have come down, inflation has gone up, investment has come down, industrial production has gone down and this is happening despite a record reduction in crude oil prices," he said
 ' Ramesh's statement comes after Jaitley and some other ministers attacked the Congress's 'first Family' for a parliamentary deadlock two days ago at a newspaper's award ceremony
 jetali ne sanket die the ki mahatvapurn vidheyakon ko paarit karaane ke liye 'vaikalpik maarg' ko apanaaya jayega
 Accusing the finance minister of trying to create a rift between the Congress and its leadership, party leader Jairam Ramesh said that this was being done because Jaitley had 'completely lost control over the economic situation'
 ' ek samvaadadaata sammelan main unhone kaha, 'vitt mantri hone ke bajaae jetali naarad muni ho gaye hai
 He should stop becoming Narada Muni and become Finance Minister
 ' manyataon ke mutabik naarad muni puri duniya main bhraman karte the or ek jagah kii kahani duusari jagah le jate the, jisase tanaav paidaa hota tha
 The comments ramesh ne kaha ki congress party or iske netritv ke bich koi matbhed nahin he
 He said, 'the Finance Minister is creating the illusion that both the Congress leadership and the Congress are different
 ' unhone daawa kiya ki didisie ghotaale main gambhir aaropon kaa saamana karne ke baad vitt mantri 'vyagr or baichaiyn' hai
 He alleged, 'the Prime Minister is shamelessly engaged in personal public relations campaign and the Finance Minister is unable to handle the economy
 ' unhone kaha, 'vikaas nahin ho rahaa he, niryaat kam ho gaya he, mahangaai bad gai he, nivesh neeche aa gaya he, audyogic utpaadan bahut neeche chalaa gaya he or kachche tel kii keemton main record kami ke baavjood aisa ho rahaa he
 ' ramesh kaa bayaan jetali or kuch anya mantriyon dwaara do din pehle ek akhbaar ke puraskaar samaaroh main sansadeey gatirodh ke liye congress ke 'pratham parivaar' par hamale ke baad aayaa he
 Jaitley indicated that an 'alternative route' would be adopted to pass important Bills

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who reached out to support these satyagrahis, has assured that he will first implement the land reform policy approved by the central government in his state
 udhar ummid jataai ja rahi he ki 11 oktober ko kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh kii maujuudagi main agra main samjhaute par hastakshar hoga

 in satyagraiyon ko manaane kii centre sarkaar kii ore se koshishen jari hai, vahiin satyagrahi likhit samjhaute se kam par maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 To support these Satyagrahis, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan arrived in Agra on Thursday along with his wife Sadhna Singh and Women Child Development Minister Ranjana Baghel and also participated in the padyatra with him
 is maukey par mukhyamantri ne kaha ki mapra main garib bhoomihin jahaan kabiz hai unhen us jagah kaa patta de diya jayega chaahe vah sarkari jagah ho yaa gaiyr sarkari

 But as soon as the news of the decision came to the cracker merchants and people came to know, there was a sudden rush on the shops
 jama masjid par pataakhon kii kai dukaane hai
 Many people appeared here buying crackers worth thousands of rupees

 Therefore, firecrackers also buy

 Many shopkeepers were seen selling firecrackers in the area
 jab 'aaj tak' kii team ne unase poocha ki ab to supreme court ne pataakhe bechney par bain laga diya he to unka kahana tha ki abhi hamaare paas koi order nahin aayaa he
 On media reports, we cannot close the shop

 When the Aaj Tak team asked most traders about their problem, they said that we have suffered a lot
 isaki bharpai nahin ho sakati
 We will go to court once again
 abhi to bikri shuru bhi nahin hui thi ki bain lag gaya
 Talking of the fireworks market of Jama Masjid, the business of crores of rupees has been destroyed

 As the media cameras reached their shops, they had to hide the firecrackers
 kai dukandaar kah rahe the ki media vaale chalem jaaen, hamen koi takalif nahin
 That is, shopkeepers today were busy selling only crackers
 jab logon septaakhon ke bain par sawalkia gaya to unka kahana tha ki ye faisla sahi bhi he
 Our children are getting sick from pollution
 aise main ye ek acha faisla he
 Last year, there was a lot of pollution on Diwali, so this year this decision will prove to be good
 haa magar diwali main majaa to kirkira ho jayega

 khubasurat, muskuraahat se bhari 40 varshiya dimple chandigarh ke punjab state ajukeshan board skool main kaam karti hai
 She teaches social knowledge and English to children from class 6th to 10th
 dopaher saadhe-teen baje tak ve bacchon ke saath vyast rahati hai
 Taking classes, looking at test papers and preparing for the next day's lesson
 is dauraan unke paas phone uthaane tak kii fursat nahin hoti
 But after returning home, drinking tea, he admitted that not a single day has been spent in the last 14 years when he has not missed Vikram

 'when i pass by the bus stop, i remember how i used to leave them here and how they used to catch the bus wherever they had to go

 When i am at the Nada Saheb Gurdwara, i remember how once they had done a parikrama with me and said, 'happy, Mrs
 Batra, we have completed our fourth journey and according to Sikhism, now both our husbands -wives
 ’ jab main pinjor gardens main hoti hum to mujhe yaad aata he ki kaise kashmir jane se pehle unhone apni jeb se ek blade nikaala tha or usase apana angootha kaat kar khun se meri maang bhari thi

 'I did not go close
 vahaan bahut se media ke log the or main vahaan ro kar tamaasha khadaa nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 'she held her brother's hand and watched her funeral from a distance
 vikram ke mata-pita ne bheed main salwar-kameez pahane us ladki ko dekh liya tha lekin ve khud itane dukhi the ki unhone yah pataa lagane kii koshish nahin kii ki vah koun he
 She returned to Chandigarh and decided that instead of marrying someone else, she would spend her life with Vikram's memories
 ‘ve kamaal ke mouj masti karne vaale shaks the
 They were also very beautiful
 unhen logon ke kaam aana acha lagata tha
 But the thing that does not let me forget them is that they were my best friends with whom i could share my intimate feelings and hope that they would understand me, 'he said, sometimes when they were clockwise They see and it is half past seven in the evening and if the day is Wednesday or Sunday, their heartbeat stops even today
 yuddh par jane se pehle chaar saal tak ve chaahe kahin bhi hon saptaah main do baar isi samay phone kiya karte the
 "he could have been anywhere in Palampur, Dehradun, Sopore or Delhi but his phone used to come without any time at the same time, and i too used to hover around the phone at that time so that i could pick up before my father picked up the phone
" He told with a sad smile
 ab phone unke liye unke vakt par nahin bajataa or jab bajataa bhi he to usase vikram kii jaani pahachaani aawaaj nahin aati
 They used to call, but now where they have gone, there are no phones

 Every accomplishment that a person aspires to by reciting the Shivtandava Stotra daily, is easily accomplished by the grace of Lord Shiva
 aaie jaanate hai shiv tandav strot kaise bana tha-kuber va ravan donon rishi vishrava kii santan the or donon sautele bhai the
 Sage Vishrava gave the kingdom of gold Lanka to Kubera but for some reason, at the behest of his father, he left Lanka and went to Himachal
 kuber ke chale jane ke baad isse dashanan bahut prasann hua
 He became the king of Lanka and gradually after gaining the kingdom of Lanka, he became so egoistic that he started committing many kinds of atrocities on the ascetics
 jab dashanan ke in atyaacharon kii khabar kuber ko lagi to unhone apane bhai ko samajhane ke liye ek doot bheja, jisane kuber ke kahe anusaar dashanan ko satya path par chalane kii salaah di
 Listening to the advice of Kubera, Dasanan was so angry that he took that messenger captive and killed him instantly with his sword in anger
 kubre kii salaah se dashanan itnaa krodhit hua ki doot kii hatya ke saath hi apni sena lekar kuber kii nagari alakapuri ko jeetne nikal padaa or kuber kii nagari ko tahas-nahas karne ke baad apane bhai kuber par gada kaa prahaar kar use bhi ghayal kar diya lekin kuber ke senapatiyon ne kisi tarah se kuber ko nandanvan pahunchaa diya 
 Since Dashanan had also taken possession of the city of Kubera and his Pushpak plane, one day, Pushpak boarded the plane and went towards Sharavan
 lekin ek parvat ke paas se guzarate hue uske puspak vimaan kii gati swayan hi dhimi ho gai
 Since Pushpak Vimana had the feature that it was moving at the will of the driver and its speed was faster than the speed of mind, Dushanan got a big surprise when the speed of Pushpak Vimana slowed down
 tabhi uski drushti saamne khadey vishaal or kaale sharir vaale nandishwar par paddy
 Nandishwar warned Dashanan that - Here Lord Shankar is engrossed in the game, so you return, but Dasanan was so stunned after conquering Kubera that he was not ready to listen to anyone
 use usne kaha ki- koun he ye shankar or kis adhikaar se vah yahan krida karata he? main us parvat kaa naamo-nishaan hi mitaa doongaa, jisane mere vimaan kii gati avaruddha kii he
 Saying so, he tried to raise his hand on the foundation of the mountain
 achaanak is vighn se shankar bhagwaan vichlit hue or vahiin baithe-baithe apane paanv ke anguuthe se us parvat ko dabaa diya taaki vah sthir ho jaae
 But due to Lord Shankar's doing this, Dashanan's arm was buried under that mountain
 falswaroop krodh or jabardast peeda ke kaaran dashanan ne bheeshan chitkaar kar uthaa, jisase aisa lagane laga ki maano pralay ho jayega
 Then the ministers of Darshanan advised him to praise Shiva so that his hand would be free from that mountain
 dashanan ne bina deree kiye hue samaveda main ullekith shiv ke sabhi stotron kaa gaan karnaa shuru kar diya, jisase prasann hokar bhagwaan shiv ne dashanan ko kshamaa karte hue uski banhon ko mukt kiya

 in sari baton ko dekhte hue ye jaruri ho jaataa he ki aap apni twachaa ke prati satark rahen
 The biggest recipe for skin care is to avoid the use of cosmetic things as much as possible and count the home remedies in the habit

 Addressing voters like Singh through this medium of internet said, 'congress gives you strength

 The Center has given Dineshwar Sharma, a negotiator for Jammu and Kashmir, 'full freedom' to choose parties to negotiate with a view to resolving the Valley's long-standing crisis
 ' ye kahana he kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh kaa
 Rajnath Singh was on an election tour of Himachal Pradesh on Thursday
 isi dauraan unhone 'aaj tak' se khaas baatcheet main kashmir samet tamaam muddon par charchaa kii
 When asked if any interaction with Hurriyat leaders was possible, Singh said, "they will decide what to do and what not to do
" ye puri tarah unhen tay karnaa he ki kin-kin ke saath baat kii jaani chahie
 They have not been given any specific instructions
 unhen ye faisla karne kii puri swatantraaa he ki unhen kinake saath baat kerani he
 Dineshwar Sharma, a former director of the Intelligence Bureau, was appointed as the central negotiator last month for continuous dialogue with the parties towards the restoration of peace in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, ‘dineshwar sharma bharat sarkaar ke pratinidhi hai, unhen vahaan bandhe haath nahin bheja gaya he
 They are given complete freedom to negotiate and reach a definite conclusion
 ’ singh ne jor dekar kaha ki sharma ko kendriya vaartakar niyukt kiye janaa sarkaar kii us manshaa ke anuroop he jinke tahat wo ghati main kinhin bhi sambhavit shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye raste or tareeke talashna chaahati he
 Singh said, 'I believe that there is no such problem that can be solved only by force, whether it is police or army
 logon kii shikayaton kaa nirikshan hona chahie
 If there are any complaints, they can be resolved
 ham unhen sulajhane kii koshish karenge
 That is why we have appointed a negotiator
 vaartakar vahaan jaaenge, logon se baat karenge or hamen report denge
 Singh disagreed with such accusations of Hurriyat, appointing Kisharma just to throw dust in the eyes
 singh ne kaha ki ghati main ashaanti kaa gaharaai se vishleshan karne kii jarurat he, jisase ki sambhavit samaadhaan nikaala ja sake
 The Home Minister said, 'the truth is that if there are some problems then they should be resolved
 aise koun se kaaran hai jinase aise halaat bane
 That is why a negotiator has been appointed to churn deeply
 ’ye puche jane par ki kya unhone jammu or kashmir main kuch muddon kii pehle se hi pahchaan kar lee he, singh ne kaha, ‘centre samasyaon kaa nirikshan karne kaa icchhuk he jinhen sauhardpurn dhang se suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 'he said,' i am not saying that there have been some complaints (identified) already
 main ye kah rahaa hum ki agar koi shikaayatein hai, jinhen suljhaayaa ja saktaa he to unhen suljhaayaa janaa chahie, agar ve jammu or kashmir ke logon ke hit main or rajya ke hit main hai
 The central government's decision to appoint Sharma as the new interlocutor came after the Home Minister's recent visit to the Valley

 aap bataaie ki commercial cinema ke bare main aap kya sochate hai? jab log mujhase kehete hai ki koi masala film karo to main yah baat pachaa nahin paata hum
 Amitabh Bachchan: i do not think this needs to be debated
 har film paisa banane ke liye banaai jaati he, phir vah tathakthith kala film ho yaa 'alag tarah kaa cinema'
 The audience decides whether it is a masala film or not and would they like to see it again? So when you talk about different types of cinema, the credit should go to the audience in the true sense, because they want to see something reliable
 lekin agar aap yah kah rahe hai ki aapaki tarah kaa cinema paisa nahin bana rahaa he, to aap galat hai
 Many of your films did huge business

 maine jo korporation shuru kiya tha, usamen mujhe badi naakaami mili, isane mujhe diwalia kar diya
 i had no money, no film, lenders followed me, it was a terrible experience
 maine tay kiya ki main ek abhinayta hum or main kaam maangane yash chopra ke paas gaya
 Ranbir: And while asking for work, you did not come across as important

 Ranbir: i have seen you remember a four-page monologue in an hour
 aap script se bandhe hote hai yaa usamen kuch sudhaar karte hai?amitabhmain script par hi aage badhata hum
 The writer is the most important person in a film
 vah sirf lekhak nahin hota, balki vah likhte samay nirdeshak, set diziner, sangeet nirdeshak sab kuch hota he
 This is the most difficult job
 isliye yah kahana ki main vahi kahuunga jo mujhe acha lagata he, uskaa apmaan karnaa hoga
 Ranbir: And you never thought of directing a film? Amitabh: No
 main nahin jaanata ki yah kaise kiya jaataa he
 Ranbir: But the direction is to tell how to tell the story? It is difficult to tell through Amitabh: Lance
 aap yah kaise janenge hai ki trollies kahaan rakhni he, kahaan paidal chalanaa he, kalakaar ko yah bataanaa ki aap usase kya chaahate hai?ranbirakya aap koi kahani likhenge?amitabhmainne kabhi koshish nahin kii
 Ranbir: i have
 mere man main ek kahani kaa vichaar aayaa, maine kuch logon ke saath ise saajha kiya, lekin maine aalas main ise likhaa nahin
 i do not have that skill
 yah kaushal yaa to paidaaishi hota he yaa nahin hota
 Amitabh: If you have such an idea in your mind and why it is happening even at midnight, record it by speaking
 use kisi aise dost ko de do, jo lekhak ho
 Do not know, something valuable came out from that
 ranbirakya aap uti main abhinetriyon ke saath naach-gaanaa miss karte hai?amitabhshyah badi mehnat kaa kaam he or mujhe pasand nahin

 mujhe aaj bhi nakaaratmak media kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Ranbir: You did not talk to the media for a long time
 amitabhahunhen lagata tha ki immergency ke samay media par lage pratibandh ke liye main jimmedaar tha
 Photographers placed their cameras on the ground in protest
 unhone jab mujhe pratibandhit karne kaa faisla kiya, tab maine bhi kaha tha ki main bhi unase baat nahin karuunga
 i had not spoken to him for nearly 15 years! Ranbir: How are your relationships today? Amitabh: i love him
 main or kya kah saktaa hum (tahaakaa)? mujhe landan main aapse hui ek mulaakaat yaad aa rahi he, ham log ek hi hotel main tehre hue the
 You had a book in your hand and you were going to the park to read it
 aapane kaha tha, "mujhe apane liye thodaa jagah chahie
 Mumbai is very tight
 main vahaan aisa nahin kar saktaa
 "ranbir: i was going through a change in my life, i had a breakup with my girlfriend
 main kuch samay bitaana chahta tha
 That is why i talked to you about loneliness
 vaaki mujhe akelaa rahanaa acha lagata he
 This is the most fun
 ranbirakya aap kisi ko aapaki byopic banane denge?amitabhanahin
 i am the most dull man
 na hi aatmakatha likhuunga
 Ranbir: Your blog is a short form of your autobiography? Amitabh: It is a commercial risk
 yadi main apadet na karun to hajaaron log meri gardan pakad lenge
 But writing autobiographies is scary
 ranbiramujhe aapke saath kaam karne kaa mauka kab milegaa?amitabhmain ummid karata hum ki ham saath kaam karenge, kyonki mujhe aapse acting kaa paath padhuya he

 Rojo Thomas, who complained about this serial murder case, has said that Jolly, accused of murder, used to force him to withdraw the complaint
 jab civil cese par madhyasthata hone kii baat chal rahi thi tabhi baar-baar jolly, rojo par dabaav banaati thi
 Fed up with this, Rojo decided that separate cases of suspicious death and land disputes should be filed
 rojo, roy thomas kaa bhai he jo ki jolly kaa pehla pati he
 Dolly allegedly killed Roy by poisoning him
 rojo america main rahata tha or kerala main jaanch ke antim din apana bayaan darj karaane aayaa tha
 Rojo said that the police have recorded the statement
 hamen jo bhi jaankaree thi, use police ko bataa diya he
 Rojo said that the inquiry is not yet complete
 9 ghanton tak poochtacha chali, kal bhi bayaan darj kiye jaaenge
 We have not given any new documents, investigations are going on on the basis of all the already existing documents
 meri shikaayat par hi jaanch prakriya shuru hui he
 Most guesses came from Sahirojo, who said that most of our estimates are correct, but we never thought that the matter would be investigated with such intensity
 jaanch agenciyon ko jaanch puri karne den, jisase nyaay mil sake, unhen jo mar chuke hai
 There was a conspiracy against my sister too, i never felt it because i was not here
 jab main kerala bhi aayaa tab bhi kabhi main apane ghar par nahin rukaa
 Rojo said that i used to stay at my wife's house, or several times at the hotel
 jolly mujh par dabaav banaati thi ki main shikaayat waapas le luun
 When it came to arbitration in the civil case, Jolly put a condition that the complaint should be withdrawn
 lekin main is par sahamat nahin hua, jameen vivaad ko maine alag rakhaa
 When we looked at Jolly's constantly changing statements, we realized that there was a contradiction in her statements
 hamen jaanch team par puraa bharosa he, jaanch team kii karrwai se ham santusht hai
 How many deaths happened? Jolly's mother-in-law Anamma died in 2002, shortly after having dinner
 6 saal baad jolly ke sasur tom thomas kii maut bhi isi tarah se hui thi
 In 2011, Jolly's husband Roy also died in suspicious circumstances
 roy ke shav se synide ke sample mili the
 After this, Anamma's brother Mathew was killed in April 2014 and then a 2-year-old child Alfine died who seemed to be Jolly's relative
 alphine kii maut ke baad 2016 main achaanak alphine kii maa phili ko bhi bechaini uthati he or achaanak usne bhi dam tod diya
 This was the sixth death at home

 Along with this, they will have to sign a memorandum of law for the construction of Ram temple in Parliament

 If sources are to be believed, all the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha mps of BJP will sign a memorandum regarding the enactment of a law in Parliament for the construction of vhp's Ram temple

 If the government does not pass the Ram temple construction law in the Winter Session of Parliament, then a big decision will be taken on the vhp's Ram Mandir, the High Powers Committee of the Saints, on January 31, 2019 and February 1, in the temple ceremony held at Kumbh in Allahabad

 People jumped into the drain after receiving the news of the notes flowing in the drain
 isse pehle ki police maukey par pahunch paati log note batorkar vahaan se rafuchakkar ho gaye
 The police have taken the remaining notes in their possession
 maamla thana gajipur ke sarvoday nagar kaa he
 Where there was chaos at the time on Friday morning, when people saw old notes of five hundred and thousand flowing in the channel
 police ko soochna mil paati isse pehle hi log naale main kud gaye or noton kii lutpaat karne lage
 It is being told that people escaped from the spot by looting large numbers of currency notes
 kaaphi der baad soochna milane par khud espi durgesh kumaar baari police bal ke saath maukey par ja pahunche or bache hue noton ko apane kabje main liya
 Whereas before that, a lot of people had left
 haalanki police kaa kahana he ki puraane noton kii sankhya kaaphi kam thi
 The police have now started investigating these notes as to who threw these notes in the drain in lakhs
 or yah kalaadhan kis shaks kaa tha
 The police are yet to get a clue in the matter
 aapaki lagjri gaadi chori ho jaae to aap fariyaad lekar police stesan jate hai, lekin agar pulisavaala hi choron ke giroh main shaamil ho to? uttar pradesh ke gorakhpur main aisa hi ek maamla saamne aayaa he

 Either BJP will form the government or there will be President's rule
 agar in donon main se koi vikalp lagu na hua to vidhansabha bhang hogi
 This is the strategy of the BJP and the Narendra Modi government at the Center regarding Uttarakhand, which are entangled in the complexities
 jiskaa khulaasa karte hue sarkaar or bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kaa daawa he ki maujuuda vidhansabha main kisi bhi keemat par congress kii harish ravat sarkaar phir se sthapit nahin hone di jaaegi
 Any internal factionalism does not sidestep the bjp's Operation Lotus, so the central leadership, drawing the Laxman line of discipline, has told all the senior leaders of the Chief Minister's plan that they want to stay in the party, the high command's decision Have to agree
 haalanki satta ke ganit ko lekar rajya main donon hi partiyon kii duvidha barkaraar he or donon kii nigahen nainital hoicourt par tiki hui hai
 The Congress hopes are set on revoking the membership of only 9 rebel mlas and have decided to go to the polls, on the other hand the BJP has prepared a complete gameplan of power in Uttarakhand due to the influence of its government at the Center
 bijepi ne sarkaar banane kii disha main pahal tej kar di he kyonki sanvaidhanik baadhyataa (60 din ke bheetar sansad kii muhar) ke mutabik, 27 april tak raashtrapati shashan par sansad kii manjuuri jaruri he or rajyasabha main vipaksh kaa bahumat hone kii vajah se use paarit kara paanaa modi sarkaar ke liye mumkin nahin he
 Therefore, if the court is not clear soon, then the Central Government can adopt the option of forming a new government like Arunachal Pradesh so that the immediate benefit can be taken in the election of a Rajya Sabha seat to be held after two months
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah khud 14 april ko uttarakhand pahunchenge jahaan unhen haridwar ke premanagar ashram main bijepi netaa or aadhyatmik guru satpal maharaj kii ore se yojit salanaa baisakhi mahotsav main shaamil hona he
 But there they will meet the leaders and workers of the party separately and take stock of the political situation
 kya he satta kii ranneetibijapi kaa maananaa he ki hycourt congress ke 9 baagi sadasyon ko vidhansabha main voting se nahin roak saktaa kyonki takneekee taur par in vidhayakon ne abhi tak kisi vip kaa ulanghan hi nahin kiya he
 The party is assuming that the BJP will now be invited by the Governor to form an alternative government, and with the help of 9 rebels in the assembly, it is required to easily get a majority of 36 in the 70-member assembly (bjp's 27 and Congress's 9)
 lekin adaalat kii ore se pehle harish ravat ko bahumat hasil karne kaa mauka miltaa he to baagiyon kii vajah se ravat jaadui aankade ko hasil nahin kar paaenge
 In such a situation, there will be a case of whip violation on the rebels, but the decision to cancel their membership will also have to be taken by the assembly speaker
 bijepi kaa daawa he ki rajyapal kii ore se uske baad bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka milegaa or vidhansabha spikar unki marji kaa hoga, isliye baagiyon kii sadsyta radd karne kaa faisla sunwaayee ke naam par usee tarah chunaav tak latakaaya ja saktaa he jaisaa uttar pradesh main kesharinath treepathi ne bispi vidhayakon ke maamle main kiya tha
 But bjp's second strategy is also without these 9 rebels
 agar 9 kii sadsyta khaarij hoti he to vidhansabha main bijepi or congress donon ke 27-27 vidhayak honge kyonki bijepi ne bhi 28 main se apane ek vidhayak kii sadsyta radd karne kii yachika de di he
 If the membership of 10 mlas ends, the Assembly will become 60 members and only 31 mlas will be needed for a majority
 aise main bispi ke 2, eukedy ke 1 or 3 nirdaleey vidhayakon (sabhi 6 vidhayakon ne milakar peedief naam se front bana rakhaa he) kii bhoomika kingmekar kii ho jaaegi
 BJP strategists have started talks with independent camp mlas for this formula
 lekin bijepi ke sutron ke mutabik maujuuda paristhiti main peedief ke sabhi vidhayak harish ravat ke kheme main majbootee ke saath khadey hai
 But a senior BJP leader claims that the remaining four mlas, except the BSP, have given confidence that they are willing to consider the minister with the condition of ministerial post if the party gets a chance to form the government on behalf of the governor
 in vidhayakon main se teen se to rajya ke do purv mukhyamantri sidhe baatcheet kar rahe hai
 Apart from contacting these mlas, BJP claims that 2 BSP mlas can be persuaded to remain absent from the House
 bijepi kii in ranneetiyon kii pushti uttarakhand bijepi ke prabharee or rashtriya upaadhyaksh shyaam jaju kii is tippanee se bhi hoti he, ''hamane raashtrapati shashan kii maang kii thi, vah lag gaya yah hamaari vijay he kyonki congress vahaan satta main nahin he
 Now there can be only two types of situation in Uttarakhand - President Raj or our government
 '' haalanki maamla kanoonee ladaai main ulajh jane se bijepi ko apni ranneeti paravaan chadhaane main deree ho rahi he
 Whereas it was believed that the BJP could adopt the option of going to the polls due to internal infighting for the post of Chief Minister
 majaburi kaa naam koshyariab bijepi alaakaman uttarakhand kii satta main kabiz hone ko is kadar bekaraar he ki usne varisht netaaon ko anushaasan kaa danda dikhaane ke saath-saath saamaajik-kshetreey sameekaran bhi tatola he
 In this equation of the party, the lottery of 73-year-old Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who was the Chief Minister of the state for the shortest time (3 months 29 days), is seen opening
 bijepi bhale hi harish ravat kii sarkaar ke girane main apni bhoomika se inkaar kar rahi he, lekin paristhitiyaan uske daawey ko pusht nahin kar raheen
 On the other hand, in the midst of political and legal turmoil, the party is also worried about the way Harish Rawat has waged a campaign to get support among the people by calling himself a head-cut Chief Minister
 aise main bijepi ke ranneetikaron ne rajnatik halaat kii samiksha kii to unhen ahsaas hua ki ravat ko sahanubhuti mil rahi he
 a senior BJP leader says that sympathy can have an impact on the 29 assembly seats of the Kumaon region
 sutron ke mutabik, isliye party ranneeti ke tahat purv mukhyamantri bhagat singh koshyari ke netritv main sarkaar gathan kaa man bana rahi he
 Both Rawat and Koshyari hail from the Kumaon region and both belong to the Rajput community
 bijepi kaa maananaa he ki koshyari ko mukhyamantri banane se ravat ko mil rahi sahanubhuti ko roka ja saktaa he
 Like Rawat, Koshyari has an image of simplicity and easygoing leader and both have the same grounded ground
 itnaa hi nahin, congress ke 9 baagi bhi koshyari ko hi mukhyamantri banane kii ichha oparation lotus ke senapati bijepi mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey ke saamne rakh chuke hai
 It is also being argued in favor of Koshiyari that even before this he has been prevented from becoming the Chief Minister twice, so the party workers also have sympathy for him
 haalanki koshyari abhi loksabhaa saansad hai, lekin party kii ranneeti 27 april ke aasapaas hi shapath grahan karaane kii he taaki chah maheene sarkaar chalaakar vicasonmukh yojanaon par focus kiya jaae or jald vidhansabha bhang kar chunaav main jaaya jaae
 The state of electoral development on a war footing, amidst political instability in Uttarakhand, the Center has opened its mouth for development schemes
 raashtrapati shashan ke pehle hi pakhwaade main espie yani special program assistance ke tahat doon ke nirmaanadhin fliover ke liye centre ne 33
 34 crores Rs
 or srinagar ke gadhwal ke ek pul nirmaan ke liye 26
 91 crores Rs
 or garasain main polytechnic nirmaan ke liye bhi paisa sweekrut karne ke saath rajya main chal rahe ardh kumbh ke liye bhi sau karod ru
 Is approved
 kul 447 karod rupaya manjuur kar pehali baar pradesh main nirmaan kaaryon ke liye paise kaa tota na rahane dene ke sanket centre ne die hai jabaki ab tak congress kii sattashin sarkaar centre par rajya ke vikaas ke liye paise na jari karne ko mudda banaati rahi thi
 According to the strategy, the BJP, led by Koshyari, will try to implement the development package within the first six months to give the message that the BJP is committed to the development of the state
 iske alaava bhi bijepi ne chah maheene main chunaav ke lihaaj se uplabdhiyaan ginane laayak vaali vishesh pariyojnaon ko haath main lene kaa khaakaa bhi bana liya he
 Roads of Chardham should not be spoiled even in snowfall, start the railway line work for Chardham, complete all railway flyovers in the state, provide gas connections to all BPL families under the Prime Minister's Ujjwala Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana Under its agenda, many schemes like laying a network of roads in villages and speeding up the construction of 100 helipads in the mountain area Which is a strategy to be carried out on a war footing
 chunavi mood main rajnatik dalvarsh 2017 main apane boote satta main aane kaa mansuba paale baithi bijepi chah maheene ke liye satta ke guna-bhaag main juty he jabaki congress apni sarkaar ko giraae jane se swayan ko shahid dikhne kii koshish kar pehle hi din se sahanubhuti hasil karne main lagi he
 As soon as the party is ousted from power, the Congress is marching in the first nine assembly constituencies with the slogan of 'save Democracy', from where the mlas won on Congress ticket rebelled and destabilized the government
 congress in kshetron main matadaataaon ke bich jaakar in baagiyon kii bijepi ke saath mileebhagat kar rajya sarkaar ko asthir karne ke shadyantr kaa bhandaphod karne kii baat kah rahi he
 But the rebels along with BJP workers are opposing this Yatra Bachao Yatra with black flags opposing the yatra
 congress ke pradesh adhyaksh kishor upaadhyaay kehete hai, ''hamen hamaari baat kehane se rokna jahaan bijepi ke liye aatmghaatee sabit hone vaala he vahiin baagiyon kaa to uttarakhand se patta saaf hona tay he
 Clearly, despite all the micromanagement and electoral changes in Bihar and Delhi, the BJP did not want to take any risk in Uttarakhand, so it fomented the discord of the Congress and toppled the Rawat government to tarnish Rawat's image
 Could strengthen his electoral ground

 in ek baar phir sahi sabit hui he
 We had already informed our readers that many young leaders of Congress are angry with senior leaders of their own party
 unhone isaki shikaayat rahul gandhi se kii thi
 It was told that Rahul Gandhi will pull senior leaders in the working committee meeting
 hua bhi kuch aisa hi
 On Friday evening, when this important committee of Congress met, Rahul Gandhi fiercely pulled senior leaders on the pretext of giving advice
 rahul gandhi ne varisht netaaon ko aade haathon lete hue naseehat di ki ve party line se baahar na jaaen or media ke saamne apane ravaiye ko sudhaaren
 Sources informed that the Congress Vice President dragged the leaders fiercely in the meeting
 ve aalochana karne kaa koi mauka nahin chuke
 Rahul Gandhi exhorted senior leaders and said, 'what you do, the younger ones follow it
 isliye saavdhaanee barti jaae
 Especially when talking to the media, you should not look weak
 is baat kaa bhi khyaal rakhaa jaae ki aapke ravaiye kaa yuva netaaon or party kaaryakartaaon par bura asar naa pade
 'rahul Gandhi did not stop here
 unhone saaf kar diya ki senior netaa party line ko follow karen
 He said, 'senior people should tell the public about the achievements of the government
 kisi mudde par party jo line tay karti he uskaa sabhi paalan karen
 It is noteworthy that Rahul Gandhi spoke to 30 young leaders on election preparations, so Rahul had to listen to the criticism about some senior leaders
 noujvaan netaaon ne rahul se do took shikaayat kii ki hamaare senior netaaon kii body language or vyavhaar se aisa lagata he jaise wo maan chuke hai ki party chunaav haar rahi he
 After this, Aaj Tak had reported on Thursday that Rahul Gandhi will discuss with the Congress Working Committee members about the attitude of senior leaders
 iskaa saboot he tivi today group ke managing editor(input) rifat javed kaa twit jo unhone guuruuvaar ko hi share kar diya tha
 # rahulgandhito meet CWC members tomorrow
 Will admonish senior party leaders on their defeatist attitude
 First on @ aajtak @ headlinestoday — Rifat Jawaid (@rifatjawaid) February 20, 2014 Once again Aaj Tak has proved that when it comes to the news, we are the fastest, as well as the most accurate and reliable

 Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and husband of Priyanka Gandhi, has welcomed the Supreme Court's decision to close liquor shops within 500 meters of the National and State Highways
 fasebuk par wadra ne likhaa ki supreme court kaa ye faisla sammaan or prashansa ke yogya he
 Vadra wrote that this would be a major step towards road safety
 sadakon par suraksha mandandon ke prati udasin hone ke kaaran durbhagyapurna durghatana main apni bahan (vah sirf 33 saal kii thi) ko kho chukaa hum
 i fully support shutting down liquor sales along the highway
 haalanki wadra ne isse hone vaale nuksaanon kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He wrote that this would have a bad impact on the hospitality industry and could affect about 1 million employees
 robert wadrane aage likhaa ki media reporton ke mutabik, kuch vikreta sharaab beyimaani se bech rahe hai
 This beats the purpose of the order
 isse bhrashtachar or sharaab kii blike marketing main ijapha hoga
 i hope the loss to employment and industry can be prevented if the order is implemented in future with some modifications
 supreme court ne apane 15 disambar, 2016 ke aadesh main neshnal or state haive ke donon taraf 500 meter ke daayre main sharaab kii dukaanon ko pratibandhit kar diya tha
 While the Supreme Court has completely exempted Sikkim and Meghalaya from the ban, Himachal Pradesh has been given a provision of a distance of 220 meters in local bodies with 20,000 or less population along the highway

 Dhoni blames the batsmen most for the ODI defeat
 dhoni kii nazar main middle order kaa asafal hona, jeet na milane kii sabase badi vajah he
 8 in four odis named for Virat Kohli
 00 kii ausat se 24 ran rahe, vahiin suresha raina ne chaar maichon main 17
 Scored 53 runs at an average of 66
 ambati raidu ne teen maichon main 19
 58 at an average of 33 and captain Dhoni himself 23 in four odis
 33 kii ausat se sirf 70 ranon kaa yogadan diya
 After this poor performance, Dhoni said that middle order wickets in New Zealand and then Australia are falling very quickly, it is necessary to get rid of this habit
 mujhe ummid he ki khilaadi aisa kar paaenge
 Obviously Dhoni has not been disappointed, but he has asked all the players who bat in the middle order to bat more responsibly
 media main or shaayad team main bhi batting order ko lekar uth rahe sawaalon par bhi dhoni ne bebaaki se apni raay rakhi
 
 
 According to Dhoni, it is very easy to say that i will not bat at that number, but the team will have to do it if needed
 jaahir taur par ishaara viraat kohli kii ore he, jinke bare main khabaren ai ki vah apane batting order se chhedchhad ko pansad nahin kar rahe hai
 After the sp-congress alliance, seats are gradually getting divided
 guuruuvaar ko congress ke liye sabase mahatvapurn amethi or raibareli jile kii 10 siton kaa bantwaaraa ho gaya
 The SP will contest on two seats in total and Congress in 8 seats
 darasal, sapa ne pehle kuch siton par apane ummidavaar utaar die the jis vajah se gathbandhan ke baad ummidavaar asamanjas kii sthiti main the
 Notification has been issued on 52 seats of the fifth phase on Thursday
 paanchave charan main balrampur, gonda, faijabad, ambedkar nagar, baharich, shravasti, siddharthanagar, basti, santakabeernagar, sultanpur or amethi main chunaav honge
 Congress mlas are already in the SP, apart from the seats of Amethi and Rae Bareli, one more seat of Congress and SP was stuck in the fifth phase
 yah seat he baharich jile kii payagpur vidhansabha seat
 The first MLA from this seat is Mukesh Srivastava
 mukesh ne pehali baar congress ke tikat par chunaav ladaa tha or sapa kii lahar ke bich yah seat congress ke jholii main dilaai thi
 But, just before the elections, he left the Congress and joined the SP
 mukesh ko shivpal or ajam kii maujuudagi main akhilesh ne hi sapa jwine karwaai thi
 The SP had already announced the ticket of Mukesh Srivastava from this seat
 guuruuvaar ko congress ne utaara apana ummidavaarpayagpur seat se congress ne bhagat ram mishra ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 The SP gave Mukesh Srivastava a ticket on this seat
 lekin, gathbandhan ke baad is seat par bhi asamanjas bana hua tha kyonki is seat par mukesh congress ke tikat par jite the
 Significantly, a few months ago Mukesh Srivastava left the Congress and joined the SP
 congress seat kii khatir bana rahi thi dabaavasutron ke mutabik congress is seat par kaaphi lambey samay se apana haq jataa rahi thi
 According to the terms of the alliance, Congress wanted it to get this seat
 haal hi main lakhimpur kii chunavi raily main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne mukesh ko ek baar phir chunaav ladaane kaa aashwaasan diya tha jiske baad congress kheme main maahaul garm ho gaya tha
 Mukesh is fighting this option, after going to the Payagpur assembly seat Congress account, youth leader Mukesh Srivastava has two options
 pehla yah ki rakesh verma ko mili kaisarganj se sapa ke tikat par chunaav laden or doosraa payagpur vidhansabha seat se hi nirdaleey chunaav laden
 Let us tell you that Rakesh Verma, son of Rajya Sabha MP Beni Prasad Verma and former Prison Minister, refused to contest from Kaiserganj seat
 ve ramnagar seat se ummidavaari chaahate the lekin akhilesh ne vahaan aravind singh gop ko praathamikta di
 BJP once again gave Subhash a chance
 BJP has once again fielded former MLC Subhash Tripathi
 pichley chunaavon main subhash treepathi tisare number par rah gaye the
 The reason for this was for the OBC and Brahmin votes to vote in favor of Mukesh and the Kshatriya vote to lean towards Ajit Pratap Singh
 teji se badal rahe samikarnsapa-congress ke bich fansi is seat par bijepi ne najar gada rakhi he
 She is constantly engaged in uniting people at the grassroots level to bring back her stronghold
 bispi ne yahaan apana ummidavaar badal diya he
 Earlier Mayawati fielded Taurus Tiwari but now she has changed the equation by taking down a Muslim candidate
 ab payagpur vidhansabha seat par bispi se shaikh musharraf maidan main hai
 Sitpayagpur assembly seat, which came into existence in 2012, was formed in the delimitation before the 2012 assembly elections
 parisemen se pehle payagpur or visheshwarganj vikaas khand ikuna vidhansabha kshetra ke hissaa the
 In the new delimitation, the Ekona assembly seat is over
 ikuna vidhansabha seat surakshit varg main aati thi
 The constituency of the constituency was considered a BJP stronghold
 1989 se 2007 tak is seat par bijepi kaa kabja tha
 BJP had won this seat five times in a row
 1989 or 1991 ke chunaavon main is seat se bijepi netaa vishnu dayaal vidhansabha pahunche the to 1993, 1996 or 2002 ke chunaavon main akshayavar laal ne jeet darj karai thi
 In 2007, the BSP snatched the bjp's stronghold in the 2007 elections by defeating Ramsagar of the BSP by nearly 7,000 votes, defeating Akshayavar Lal and ending the bjp's supremacy over the seat
 2012 ke chunaavon main payagpur seat se congress ke mukesh shrivastav ne bispi ke ajit pratap singh ko haraaya tha
 From here BJP had given ticket to former MLC Subhash Tripathi but, his performance was disappointing
 aaj ke samay main kitni hi shaadiyaan sirf isiilie tut rahi hai kyonki purushon kaa kisi or mahila ke saath afaire hota he
 What may be the reasons for having extra marital affair after marriage
 aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 Many times some people take such steps to bring something new and adventure in their daily routine life
 vah bahut jaldi kii apni rojaanaa jindagi se bor ho jate hai
 In such a situation, they take steps like love affair after marriage
 yah baat kai shodhon main bhi sabit ho chuki he ki lagbhag 80 fisadi purush apni patniyon ko sexual ichchhaaon ke kaaran dhokhaa dete hai
 Dissatisfied with their existing relationship, they try to build a relationship in a new place
 shaadi ke baad purushon ke extra marityal relationships kaa ek mahatvapurn kaaran he rishte main boriyat aana
 Not being able to make time for each other can also be a reason
 kai baar log physicli atract ho jate hai yaa kuch vakt ke liye hi timopas karnaa chaahate hai lekin isse pehle yah jarur soch len ki agar aapke partner ne aisa kiya to kya aap maaf kar paaenge?ek baar yah jarur vichaar kar len ki aapaki partner ke saath equation kisi he
 Somewhere you don't feel insecure about each other
 agar aap apane partner ke saath apane rishton par dhyaan denge to bhaavnaatmak khalipan kii jagah nahin hone paaegi or aapkaa rishta sukhmay rahegaa

 The main pavilion of the annual meeting of the All India Representative Assembly of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in Nagaur, Rajasthan, Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar ko samarpit tha
 At the entrance itself, a large picture of Ambedkar and a small pavilion on the right as soon as he entered in, a picture exhibition was held along with a picture of former RSS sarsanghchalak Bala Saheb Deoras
 11-13 march kii is baithak main sangh ne saamaajik samarasata par ek vishesh prastaav ke jariye sabhi nagarikon, dharmik-saamaajik sanghathanon se apil kii ki ve samtayukta or shoshanmukt samaaj kii disha main prayaas karen
 The Sangh's consistent initiative in this direction is part of its deliberate strategy to increase its penetration among the Dalits and Backwards
 devaras ne 1973-74 main hindu samaaj se asprishyata ko dur karne ke liye sangh kii ore se vishesh muhim chalaai thi
 Through these symbols, the Sangh is trying to fit ideas from 'baba Saheb' to 'bala Saheb' in one frame
 isliye vah anusuchit jati-janajati ke aarakshan ko nyyochit maanata he, lekin pichhadon ke aarakshan par uske bol bijepi ke liye musiibat ban gaye hai
 After the meeting was over in Nagaur, the media was asked by the Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi of the union about the struggle for reservation on behalf of the Jats of Haryana and the Patidars in Gujarat
 When we ask for reservation, we feel that this thinking is not in the right direction
 sampann logon ko to durbal varg kii sahaayta kerani chahie, lekin aisa karne kii bajaae apane liye aarakshan maangana ambedkar kii soch ke khilaaf he
 "jat and Patel have been affluent classes," says Manmohan Vaidya, All India publicity head of the Sangh, sharing the idea with India Today in this episode
 inhen maangane ke badale dusron ko suvidha deni chahie
 The Dalits, who are also among the dalits, have not benefited from reservation even after 60 years, so it should be studied
 isamen samaaj ke logon ko hi khud aage aana chahie
 Sarsanghchalak (mohan Bhagwat) ji had said the same thing at the time (before the Bihar elections)
 ''kya he sangh kii ranneetihaal hi main haryana main jaaton ne aarakshan kii maang ko lekar jis tarah hinsak andolan kiya, usne centre or rajya main sattarudh bijepi kii peshaani par bal laa die
 Patidars have also led violent agitations in Gujarat
 in andolanon ne swaabhaavik taur par sangh kii chintaa ko badha diya
 a senior leader associated with the Sangh Parivar says, "the Sangh always thinks as a nation and every person or organization talking about a homogeneous society will say what Sarsanghchalak said during the Bihar elections or now the voice of Nagaur meeting came out is
 ''sangh kaa maananaa he ki raajnneeti or vot bank kii vajah se pichde varg ke aarakshan kaa masalaa gaahe-bagaahe uchhalata rahata he
 He is also concerned about the fact that people celebrate great work for society and country in the name of caste, which is a social curse
 jabaki sangh ne apni sthapana se ab tak jati ke naam par kabhi koi sammelan nahin kiya
 It believes that the political people for power have promoted the social curse in the name of caste and if seen in the present scenario, it will not show any picture of how it will end and who will start it
 haalanki dalit-adivasee aarakshan ko lekar sangh kii soch kuch naram he
 It is his view that it is the religion of any nation to support the victims of social injustice for centuries, but it is wrong to fit the political class under that guise
 sangh chahta he ki aarakshan ko lekar ek rashtravyapee bahes khadi honi chahie or bhagwat ke baad sangh kaa taaja bayaan bhi usee sandarbh main he
 But one leader believes that this does not seem to be happening right now
 bhagwat ke bayaan ne swayamsevakon ko disha to di, lekin sangh parivaar kii duvidha yah he ki rajnatik kshetra main kaam karne vaala uskaa vaicharik sanghathan bijepi kisi bhi surat main aarakshan kii samiksha kaa samarthan nahin kar sakati
 How did the Nigel or the BJP emerge? BJP President Amit Shah formed the OBC Front in the BJP for the first time
 At the conference of this new front on July 10 last year, he said, "we have been in power for a very short time, but the most The OBC Chief Minister, MP-MLA has been given by BJP and even today BJP has the highest number of mp-mlas of this category
 yahaan tak ki desh ko sabase pehla obisi pradhanmantri bhi hamane hi diya he
 "the enthusiasm of the support from the reserved class in the Lok Sabha elections is because of the immense support the party got from the OBC in the Lok Sabha elections
" bijepi ko 34 fisadi obisi vot mili jo 2009 ke aam chunaav ke mukaable 12 fisadi zyada the
 Whereas BJP, which secured 244 seats out of 282 Lok Sabha seats in the Hindi belt, got 48 percent OBC votes from this strip
 aath rajyon main se do rajyon jharkhand or madhya pradesh main bhi bijepi ke mukhyamantri obisi samudaay se hai
 In Uttar Pradesh alone, 26 out of 71 BJP mps belong to obcs
 lekin bijepi kaa sheersh netritv aarakshan kii samiksha vaale sangh ke lagaataar bayanon se saansat main he
 According to sources, the top BJP strategists believe that Bhaiyyaji could have avoided such a statement on the question of reservation if he wanted to, as the situation of violent ethnic conflict over reservation arose at the Center as well as the states
 , There are also BJP governments
 maujuuda paristhiti main sangh ke bayaan ko party anaavashyak maan rahi he kyonki haryana main jaaton ko aarakshan dene ke liye party kii ore se vishesh pahal ho rahi he
 a senior party leader says, "after granting reservation to the Jats, it is challenged again in the court and it is dismissed as before, then the message will be that the BJP did not deliberately plead properly under the pressure of the Sangh
 Of
 aise main halaat se nibatna or bhi kathin ho jayega
 "even at the time of Bihar assembly elections, on September 21 last year when there was a ruckus on the interview given by Panchajanya to Bhagwat, the party tried to control the damage by pleading with the Sangh
 lekin is baar bijepi ne is puure masale par chuppi saadh lee he
 According to sources, after the Sangh statement, party spokespersons were instructed not to comment on the issue
 haalanki obisi aarakshan kii samiksha ke masale par bijepi obisi morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh es
 P
 singh baghel ne india today se kaha, ''sansad main vitt mantri arun jetali ne jo bayaan diya he vahi party kaa stand he
 On March 14, Jaitley had said in the Rajya Sabha on the allegations of BSP leader Mayawati and SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav, "the policy of the government is clear that the existing system of reservation will remain
" har haalat main bani rahegi
 But Baghel demanded that caste-based census data should be made public, which could clear the confusion about reservation
 unhone rashtriya pichhadaa varg ayog ko sanvaidhanik darja dene kii maang kii
 Baghel says, "there should be Antyodaya in every step of life (lok sabha-vidhan Sabha, all the beneficial schemes of the government)"
 sabase nichle str ke log bhi aarakshan kaa laabh uthaaen, yahi saamaajik or prakritik nyaay he
 "generally, this is also the opinion of the Sangh, but the BJP does not want to weaken its backward base by scorching itself in the fire of reservation
 party ke ek netaa kaa maananaa he ki yah sambhav nahin he ki kisi jati ko aarakshan kaa laabh die jane ke baad waapas liya ja sake
 This can only happen voluntarily
 haalanki party main ek raay yah bhi he ki jis tarah upi ke mukhyamantri rahete hue rajnath singh ne saamaajik nyaay se judi ek report ke aadhaar par do-do, teen-teen jatiyon kaa guchha banaakar aarakshan ke bheetar aarakshan nirdhaarit karne kii pahal kii thi, usee tarah kii pahal kii jarurat he
 However, in view of the controversy on this issue, the Sangh argues that reservation should be reviewed by the enlightened people of these sections
 lekin sarkaar or bijepi par dabaav kii sthiti par sangh ke ek varisht padaadhikari kaa kahana he ki satta main koi bhi party ho, usase sangh ko fark nahin padataa, uskaa kaam samaaj main janajagran karnaa he taaki sarkaron ko baat maanane ke liye majaboor kiya ja sake
 But the initiative of the Sangh was called by OBC mps Forum President and Congress MP V
 hanumant raav kaa kahana he ki sangh aarakshan ko khatm karana chahta he isliye nae-nae surre chhod rahaa he, jabaki hakeekat yah he ki 27 fisadi aarakshan ke baavjood kisi bhi kshetra main obisi kii sankhya 9-10 fisadi se adhik nahin pahunch pai he
 Including both houses of Parliament, the number of OBC mps was 135 in the 15th Lok Sabha, which has come down to around 100 in the 16th Lok Sabha
 nishchit taur se loksabhaa chunaav or uske baad haryana-maharashtra chunaav main ummid se zyada safalataa hasil karne vaali bijepi obisi vot bank main bade apane aadhaar ko khona nahin chaahati
 However, she has been hurt in Bihar because after the controversy arising out of Bhagwat's statement on reservation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the entire BJP showed that its forward voters were also angry because of the backwardness of being friendly
 lihaaja sangh ke tej kadam se bijepi phir saansat main he
 With time, the RSS has taken a bold stand in the process of step by step with the RSS
 nagaur main uski akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha ke faislon main bhi yah najar aayaa
 To woo the youth, he has changed his uniform, so he has expressed his opinion on reservation, knowing that it can increase bjp's difficulties
 darasal, uski manshaa us yuva shakti ko aakarshith karnaa he jo aarakshan ko gaiyr-jaruri maanati he
 His stand on the current burning issue of 'nationalism' which wooed the youth was also clear and he condemned the alleged anti-national slogans in some universities
 iske alaava pragatisheel soch kaa parichay dete hue usne mandiron main mahilaon ke pravesh kaa samarthan kiya
 In an interaction with the media, the RSS gathering of Nagpur on the topic of gender equality made it clear that it was in favor of women entering the sanctum sanctorums of Hindu temples
 lekin uskaa kahana tha ki pravesh kii prakriya gahan vichaar-vimarsh or sahyog ke jariye tay honi chahie, na ki takaraav ke jariye
 BJP general secretary Muralidhar Rao says, "the RSS has always been in favor of progressive interpretation of religious books
 or vedon kaa kahana he ki daivi shakti ke saamne purush yaa mahila jaisaa kuch bhi nahin he
 The new thinking that many experts say for the RSS is not new, but has been part of its ideology since the beginning
 '' raav aresas ke swadeshi jaagran manch ke purv sanyojak or aresas ke divangat netaa dattopant thengdi ke vishwaasapaatr rahe hai
 However, the decision that really created a sensation in the media is a change in the uniform of the RSS
 ab khaaki nikkar kii jagah bhure rang kii pant ne le lee he
 This issue was being debated in the RSS since 2010
 ganavesh main badlaav kii mukhya vajah 91 saal puraane is sanghathan main yuvaaon ko aakarshith karne kii koshish thi
 But a change in dress may not be enough to attract them
 sangh kaa netritv jaanata he ki yuvaaon ko sanghathan main laane kii ladaai vichaardhaara ke morche par bhi ladgai hogi
 Picture of Baba Saheb Deoras in the pavilion about 1 last year
 15 lakh yuvaaon ko awasaiya shiviron main prashikshit kiya gaya tha
 In the last five years, the RSS has grown very fast

 Information about political families is given in this special issue
 inamen pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa parivaar bhi shaamil he
 Manoj Tiwari said that he distributed copies of this special issue because it is well explained that what is the difference between truly morality and talking only for things
 tiwari ne kaha ki ek taraf akhilesh yadav or unka parivaar he jinke 22 sadsy sakriy raajnneeti main hai or raajnneeti kaa laabh praapt kar rahe hai
 Manoj Tiwari also said that if you compare Prime Minister Modi's family with the kind of life he lives, then you will clearly see the difference of political philosophy between the two families
 manoj tiwari ke mutabik pradhanmantri modi ke parivaar par kii gai story ankhen kholane vaali he
 All members of his family are either living a life of scarcity or are from lower middle class or middle class
 manoj tiwari ne kaha ki is patrika ko baant kar ve mitvyayita or ucch raajnneetik shuchita kaa bhi sandesh dena chahta hum
 Which our Prime Minister has put not only in words but also in his life
 ek shart ke kaaran bhari sabha main draupadi kaa apmaan hua tha
 But then Krishna was with him
 yah kalyug he or yahaan krishna nahin, sirf kaurav vaas karte hai
 Yes, due to one condition, the honor of a daughter of the country has been severed
 aaropee faraar hai, jabaki apni khoi izzat waapas paane ke liye peedita police stesan ke chakkar kaat rahi he
 The case is of Bindapur police station, where a girl agreed to the condition of two friends
 shart yah thi ki ladki ke ghamand ko chur karnaa he or isaki purti ke liye rachaa gaya ek khel, jise sunakar haivaaniyat bhi munh mode le
 According to information from the police, the victim is a resident of Agra and used to work in a Gurgaon-based company
 vah naukari badalanaa chaahati thi or is chahat main uski mulaakaat nitin naam ke shaks se hui thi
 It is said that after initial acquaintance and phone conversation, Nitin came down to obscenity
 ladki ko bura laga isliye usne nitin ke senior vijay pandey se uski shikaayat kar di
 The girl felt that everything had gone well, but it was from here that the game started, which today, being trapped in the whirlpool, she is forced to revolve around the police station
 darasal, nitin kii shikaayat aane ke baad vijay pandey ne ladki se sahanubhuti jataai or phir uske kareeb aane laga
 The proximity grew so much that both of them started living in live relations
 vijay ne ladki ko bharosa dilaayaa ki vah usase shaadi karegaa or is vaade ke sahare ladki ne apana sarvasv vijay ko saunp diya
 Days passed, but over time, Vijay began to erupt at the point of marriage
 ladki ko shaq hua or jab maamla khulaa to vah pairon tale jameen khiskaane vaala tha
 The girl was told that all that had happened to her so far was a game
 ek shart kaa nateeja jo nitin or vijay ke bich lagi thi
 Actually, Nitin and Vijay were close friends
 ladki ne nitin ko bhav nahin diya, jiske kaaran donon ne uske ghamand ko chur karne ke liye sajeesh rachi or isi ke tahat vijay use apni havas kaa shikaar banaata rahaa
 It is not that everything ended after the case was opened
 ladki ne tuutate rishte ko bachaane ke liye samaaj ke kuch logon ke dwaara vijay pandey ko bulaava bheja
 Victory also came
 usne sabake saamne likhit taur par kaha ki vah ladki se shaadi kar legaa, lekin iske baad vah apni baat se palat gaya
 Finally, seeing no hope, the girl lodged a case report at Bindapur police station
 usne bataaya ki kaise vah agra se sapane lekar dilli ai thi or kaise do bhediyon or unki ek shart ne uski jindagi tabah kar di he
 The police have also registered a case under sections 376 and 366
 lekin ladki kaa aarope he ki police aropiyon par dabish banane kii bajaay use hi pareshaan kar rahi he
 The people of the area have also accepted the assurance written by Vijay Pandey, but there is disappointment in the attitude of the police
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) diggaj netaa or purv videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa heart atake ke baad mangalvaar 6 agast 2019 ko nidhan ho gaya
 Sushma Swaraj was also the first woman Chief Minister of Delhi
 sushamaa swaraj ke baad congress kii shila dikshit dilli kii mukhyamantri baniin jinhone 15 varshon tak lagaataar dilli par shashan kiya
 In this context, Sheila Dixit was the second Chief Minister of Delhi
 yah bhi ajeeb sanyog he ki dilli kii donon purv mahila mukhyamantriyon kaa 18 dinon ke bheetar nidhan ho gaya
 Delhiites lost two former chief ministers who were famous in their time in such a short span
 shila dikshit ke nidhan ke baad sushamaa swaraj ne twit kar shok jataayaa tha
 Sushma wrote, 'I am sad to know about the sudden demise of Sheila Dixit
 ham raajnneeti main virdohi the, lekin nijee jivan main dost the
 She was a wonderful person
 'baharhaal, shila dikshit kii shradhanjali sabha 10 agast ko dilli main yojit kii ja rahi he, or yah nishchit mana ja rahaa tha ki yadi sushamaa swaraj jivit honti to vah jarur us shradhanjali sabha main shaamil shariq hotin
 The coincidence of the news of Sheila Dixit's demise on 20 July 2019 was also received suddenly like the news of Sushma Swaraj's demise on Tuesday
 sushamaa swaraj or shila dikshit ke saath yah bhi sanyog rahaa ki apni mrityu se kuch samay pehle tak donon netaa sakriy raheen
 Sushma Swaraj tweeted about Article 370 before the heart attack and congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah
 shila dikshit kaa nidhan us samay hua jab uttar pradesh ke sonbhadra main adivaasiyon ke narsanhaar par priyanka gandhi peedit parijanon se milane ke liye pahunchi thim, lekin unhen raste main hi giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Sheila Dixit was quoted as saying that she would protest in Delhi to protest the arrest of Priyanka Gandhi
 lekin usee din shila dikshit kaa nidhan ho gaya
 At the same time, Sushma said that Harish Salve was called home because she wanted to pay him a fee of Rs 1 in the Kulbhushan case
 salve ne 1 rupee kii fees par antarrashtriya nyaayalay main kulbhushan kaa cese ladaa tha
 That is, both the former Chief Ministers of Delhi remained active till some time before the demise
 sushamaa swaraj ne shila dikshit ke bare main sahi hi likhaa ki ham raajnneeti main ek-duusake virdohi the, lekin vyaktigat jivan main dost the
 The Rafale deal was done during the tenure of the UPA, the prices were fixed during that time, the NDA government is bringing Rafale below that price
 supreme court ne mulya or prakriya donon ko sahi tehraaya he aise main sarkaar ko dosha dena kahaan tak sahi he
 This is to say Finance Minister Arun Jaitley
 agenda ajtak main pahunche jetali rajdeep saradesai ke sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the
 Jaitley said that Rahul Gandhi lied and lied in the Rafale case
 jetali ne kaha ki is baat ko samajhnaa jaruri he ki rafel hamaare liye kyon jaruri he
 In the Kargil war, we had to give martyrdom because the enemy was sitting at a height and we were attacking with guns
 agar hamaare paas koi combet plane hota to ham 2-3 kimi dur se maar kar sakate the jisase hamaara nuksaan kam ho jaataa
 After the Kargil War, the army demanded that we need a combat plane
 upie sarkaar ne rafel kii baat aage badhaai sabakuch final kar diya gaya, lekin tabake raksha mantri eke antni ne 2012 main file par likh diya ki apruv bat ristraccharing
 No one knows why he wrote this
 jetali ne kaha ki rafel mudde par rahul gandhi ne jhooth or safed jhooth bolaa
 The age of lies is very short
 rahul gandhi ko mudde kii gambhirtha ko samajhnaa chahie
 The army wanted this Rafale-like aircraft in 2008 but till today we could not give it
 congress ne jo samjhauta kiya tha usase 20 fisadi sasta vimaan ham le aae
 We saved 20 percent in his weapon
 is sawaal par ki agar aap itane confident hai to phir jepisi kaa gathan is masale par kyon nahin bana dete
 Jaitley said that BJP will have a majority in JPC but it will not be of any use
 jetali ne kaha ki supreme court ne spasht kaha he ki rafel deal kii price or prakriya ekadam sahi he lekin kuch log ise maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 On asking this, you got the facts corrected, on which Jaitley said that it is normal procedure and it is not wrong to inform the court about the facts after getting information

 a recruitment scam has come to light in India's prestigious PSU Uranium Corporation of India Limited i
e
 UCIL
 enditivi india ko jo dastauez mili hai, unhen dekhne se pataa chalata he ki usiiel main mahatvapurn padon par baithe logon ne ummidavaaron kii niyuktiyon main dhaandhlee kii or paardarshee tareeke nahin apanaae
 More than 100 appointments were rigged in the last 10 years
 ye niyuktiyaan management train str ke padon ke liye thi
 Only those who are appointed to these posts go ahead and hold important positions in UCIL
 usiiel ke mukhya satarkta adhikari yani sivio rajnish raay (ab siarpief main sthanantarit) ne isi saal is bare main ek report taiyaar kii, jisamen kaha gaya ki kai ummidavaaron kii bhartiyon niyamon ko taak par rakh kar kii gayi
 Rajneesh Rai, a 1992-batch IPS officer, has now left UCIL, but in his report sent to the CBI and the Department of Atomic Energy, he has said that the son of a senior UCIL official was tampered with to get a job
 raay apni report main kehete hai ki takneekee vibhaag ke nideshak ke bete ko naukari par rakhane ke liye santhaan main niyamon ko todaa gaya or ye niyukti bhai-bhatijawad ke tahat hui, jisamen ek ayogy ummidavaar ko medical certificate farzi tareeke se dilaayaa gaya
 In addition, more than a dozen appointments to different positions were made incorrectly
 sivio ne is maamle main sibiai se kaha he ki pehali nazar main yah ek aapraadhik maamla he
 The report, sent in February, recommended suing several officials, including ucil's seammd, but no action has been taken so far
 tippaniyan UCIL CMD d Acharya did not respond to queries sent by NDTV India
 udhar usiiel sivio rahe rajnish raay ne is par koi jaankaree dene se manaa kar diya
 Documents show that recruitments at UCIL have been rigged for the last 10 years, but in 2013, when DAE called for a response from UCIL, UCIL CMD wrote in its reply that the recruitment in UCIL was done in a completely transparent and fair manner
 Are and rules are followed
 siemdi divakar acharya ne apane jawaab main likhaa ki company main kaam karne vaale kai karmchaariyon ke bachche or rishtedaar yahaan nikalne vaale padon ke liye aavedan karte rahete hai
 The committees made for recruitment are appointed to whichever candidate they find suitable for these posts
 usiiel bharat kii ek bahut hi mahatvapurn piesu he, jo pradhanmantri karyaalay ke tahat kaam karne vaale department of atomic energy ke adheen kaam karti he
 It is the only company that can mine uranium and is also of strategic importance
 usiiel ke siemdi di acharya ne enditivi india kii ore se bheje gaye sawaalon ke jawaab nahin die
 Meanwhile, UCIL CVO Rajneesh Rai refused to give any information on this
 dastauez bataate hai ki usiiel main bhartiyon main dhaandhlee pichley 10 saal se ho rahi he, lekin 2013 main diei ne jab usiiel se jawaab talab kiya to usiiel ke siemdi ne apane jawaab main likhaa ki usiiel main bhartiyon puri tarah se paardarshee or nishpaksh tareeke se hoti hai or niyamon kaa paalan kiya jaataa he
 CMD Divakar Acharya wrote in his reply that the children and relatives of many employees working in the company keep applying for the posts coming out here
 bhartee ke liye banaai gai cametiyon ko, jo bhi ummidavaar in padon ke liye upyukt lagata he, use niyukt kiya jaataa he
 UCIL is one of the most important psus in India, functioning under the Department of Atomic Energy functioning under the Prime Minister's Office

 While watching the film, you will keep thinking about what the director and actor are doing and what the film is after all
 mujhe film main ek bhi kubi nazar nahin ai isliye meri ore se film ko ek star! 'the Legend of Michael Mishra' does not make you feel interesting nor can you keep the audience hooked at any turn
 aap film dekhte vakt yahi sochate rahenge ki diarector or actor akhir kar kya rahe hai or akhir kya sochakar yah film banaai he

 It is not right to financially commit to our citizens

 You know that in prime time, we were showing this for two days that the state cabinet gave a fee hike to private medical college, 650 students were stuck
 ham aaj bhi is mudde par prime time karne vaale the ki yah nagarikon par thopi jane vaali aarthik ghulaami he, magar aaj hamaari khabar unako mili azaadi kii soochna main badal gai he

 Not only this, who is a second year student, he also had to give the balance amount of the first year
 is tarah duusare saal ke chaatr ko 31 may tak 40 lakh rupee dene the
 Here PG fees have been increased from 10 lakhs to 30 lakhs

 Such a fee is not a matter of their control

 Some are teachers and some are third-class employees
 in maa baap ko kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa tha
 The Chief Minister in his first response had justified the hike in fees as it was his decision of his cabinet
 acchhee baat he ki unhen apane faisle kaa amanviya asar dikh gaya or use waapas le liya
 It is expected that no such manipulation will be done by the management in the coming time
 guru ram raay medical kalege ke trustee kaa bhi shukriya adaa karnaa chahie
 Can any teacher or officer of major rank give 40 lakhs in two months
 zarur privet medical collejon kii fees 40 lakh 50 lakh ho gai he magar 6 lakh se badhaakar 23 lakh karnaa thik nahin tha
 If the fees were already 40 lakhs, then these people might not take admission here
 ab is faisle par raahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Maybe some days will be able to sleep properly, or else this decision blew her senses

 This allows students to match whether the answer given by them is true or false
 kai baar jawaab bhi galat hote hai
 Now if the answer is wrong, it has to be proved by the student
 wo bhi ek hi sawaal ko ek chaatr galat sabit kar de kaaphi nahin he, chaatro ne bataaya ki har chaatr ko us galat sawaal ko galat sabit karnaa hota he

 So told the students that if they want to prove wrong then they will have to pay Rs 100 per question, that means a student will have to pay 1500 rupees, then he will be able to claim
 kya acha nahin hota ki ayog khud hi jaanch kare ki uske dwaara puche gaye sawaal or die gaye jawaab main koi kami to nahin he
 What makes sense to prove wrong by taking money from vomiting students

 The Subordinate Service Selection Board of Punjab Government has issued a notification that on April 8, the questions will be answered on the website
 kisi chaatr ko agar koi jawaab galat lagata he to use ek farm bharna hoga
 a draft of Rs 590 will have to be sent to fill the form
 agar chaatr kaa daawa sahi niklaa to paise waapas or nahin niklaa to paise rakh liye jaaenge
 The format of this form states that if any one question is wrong, then all the students will have to make different claims by making a draft of 590
 ek ke daawey karne se yaa chunauti dene sabake badale kaa daawa nahin mana jayega
 If so, it is terrible
 saraasar lut he
 It should be done that if a student questions that a particular question paper is wrong, then the commission itself should tell whether its claim is true or false
 kahin aisa to nahin ki paisa kamaane ke liye har pariksha main do chaar sawaal is tarah vivaadit rup se chhod die ja rahe hai kyonki ab aisi kai parikshaayen aapako desh bhar main milengi jinamein ek se lekar 15 or kabhi kabhi 40 prashn galat hote hai

 If you can ask BHU to extend the date, it would be a great blessing
 aniket saurabh, sitamarhi bihar If this is the case, then these things should be brought immediately to the notice of HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar so that students are not debarred from appearing in other entrance examinations due to cancellation of examination

 aisi kitni parikshaayen kahaan kahaan hoti hai, hamen pataa bhi nahin magar maanav sansaadhan mantri chahenge to chaatro ko badi raahat mil sakati he
 On March 30, Anil Swarup, Education Secretary, Government of India, appeared in front of the press and said that the Mathematics examination of class x would be held in July
 agar radd hogi to sirf haryana or dilli ke kshetra ke liye kii jaaegi
 Economics exam will be held on 25 April
 kis july ko hogi iskaa faisla karne main abhi 15 din or lagenge
 The Education Secretary says that complaints come but cannot cancel the examination on the basis of every complaint
 yah baat sahi he magar isse yah jawaab nahin miltaa ki jo shikaayat ai us par kya ection liya gaya
 Today a student has surfaced, claiming that he had written a letter to the Prime Minister's Office on March 17, but no one noticed
 maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne bhi mana he ki prashn patr ko chhapane se lekar pahunchane ke bich kai charan hote hai
 Hence the risk of leaks increases
 kam se kam unhone mana to
 Now saying that it has to be fixed
 vahiin purv maanav sansaadhan mantri kapil sibbal maang kar rahe hai ki pradhanmantri chaatro se maafee maangen magar sibbal kaa sawaal kuch or he
 They are saying that now only one question paper is for the whole country, it has become easier to leak
 tippaniyan The government should do one more thing
 isamen naagarik uddyan mantri or rail mantri kii bhoomika ho sakati he
 That is, CBSE students can withdraw their full ticket money by showing their admit card
 bahut se maa baap aise hai jinhone pariksha khatm hone ke baad bharat main or bharat ke baahar ghoomane ke liye tikat kataaya tha
 If you cancel now, it may cost them between 40 thousand and 1 lakh
 chunki galati sarkaar kii he isliye sarkaar ko hi isaki bharpai kerani chahie
 The dock media, which wants to leave the basic questions of education and entice you into Hindu Muslim Tibet, is now improving its image on the pretext of CBSE
 wo paper li kii khabaron ko aise kar rahaa he jaise use bahut chintaa he
 Had he worried, he would have also raised the questions raised by the students of the Staff Selection Commission
 madhya pradesh main lokseva ayog kii pariksha ko lekar jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai unki bhi baat karata, vahaan patawaari kii pariksha ko lekar samasya he
 From there, students are writing that a private company has conducted the examination of Patwari
 jinke kam number hai ve safal hai or jinke zyaada hai ve fail hai
 When will we take all these things seriously? isi tarah chaatr naukariyon or pariksha ko lekar bengal main bhi pradarshan kar rahe hai, upi main bhi rose pradarshan hote hai, or punjab main bhi
 It is the background of CBSE students that got so much attention or else they also understand what is the situation in the country regarding education system
 ve 12veen to paas kar jaaenge magar uske baad college kaisaa milegaa
 Will everyone have to keep coming to Delhi and Mumbai only? bhopal or patna main aisa college kyon nahin he ki koi dilli se vahaan bhej de
 My questions are basic and important
 2019 main koun jitegaa se pehle yah poochna zaruri he ki hamaara aapkaa baccha kahaan padhegaa
 How to read kai dinon se teen privet medical collejon ke 650 chaatr dharne par baithe the
 Because there the first year fees of MBBS was increased from 6 lakhs 70 thousand to 23 lakhs, the fees of the second year was increased from 7 lakhs 25 thousand to 20 lakhs and the fees of the third year was increased from 7 lakhs 36 thousand to 26 lakhs
 yahi nahin jo duusare saal kaa chaatr he use pehle saal kii balance raashi bhi deni thi
 In this way, the second year student had to pay 40 lakh rupees till 31 May
 yahaan piji kii fees 10 lakh se badhaakar 30 lakh kar di gai he
 These students have passed the competition with their talent
 itani fees inke bas kii baat nahin he
 Their parents are employed people
 koi teacher hai to koi tritiy shrenee ke karmchaaree hai
 These parents could not understand anything
 mukhyamantri ne apni pehali pratikriya main fees vruddhi ko sahi tehra diya tha kyonki yah unheen ke cabinut kaa faisla tha
 Good thing, he saw the inhuman effect of his decision and took it back
 ummid he ki aane vaale samay main prabandhan kii taraf se aisi koi chaalaaki nahin kii jaaegi
 The trustees of Guru Ram Rai Medical College should also be thanked
 kya koi shikshak yaa major rank kaa hi afasar do maheene main 40 lakh de saktaa he
 Of course, the fees of private medical colleges have increased to 40 lakh 50 lakh but it was not right to increase it from 6 lakh to 23 lakh
 pehle se hi fees 40 lakh hoti to shaayad ye log yahaan admician hi nahin lete
 Now feeling relieved at this decision
 shaayad kuch din thik se so paaenge, varna is faisle ne unke hosh uda die the
 Even if they sold their homes, they could not pay these fees
 chauthe or paanchave saal ke senior ne bhi apane junior chaatro ke andolan kaa saath diya he
 That's a good thing
 agar aap muddon ko naagarik ke adhikaar kii nazar dekhenge to dusron kaa dard bhi apana nazar aayega
 Members of the Indian Medical Association also supported the students
 is mudde ko abhibhavak sangh banaakar uthaane vaale ravindar ji abhi kuch or sawaalon ke jawaab jaananaa chaahate hai
 The Chief Minister has announced the withdrawal of the fee hike, but did he withdraw his cabinet decision
 kya ab bhi itani fees badhane kii koi sambhaavna bachi he
 You see the sky of politics, there is no other topic apart from Hindu Muslim tension
 aam janata apni pareshaaniyon ko binar poster par likhakar yahaan se vahaan bhatak rahi he
 a young man from Punjab has given a notice
 sibiesai ke chaatro ko bhi dhyaan se sunanaa chahie
 You know that sometime after the online examination, the examination board issues the answer, which is called answer key
 isse chaatr milaate hai ki unhone jo jawaab diya he sahi he yaa galat
 Sometimes the answers are also wrong
 ab agar jawaab galat he to ise sabit chaatr ko hi karnaa he
 That is not enough to prove the same question to a student wrong, the students said that every student has to prove that wrong question wrong
 madhya pradesh lok seva ayog kii isi farvari main pariksha hui
 15 answers were disputed
 to chaatro se kaha ki galat sabit karnaa he to prati sawaal 100 rupee dene honge yani ek chaatr ko 1500 rupee dene honge tab jaakar vah daavedaari kar paaegaa
 Is it not good that the Commission itself investigate whether there is any deficiency in the questions and answers given by it
 ulti chaatro se paise lekar galat sabit karne kaa kya tuk banataa he
 The Punjab government has gone one step further
 punjab sarkaar ke sabordinate sarvice salection board ne ek notification jari kiya he ki 8 april ko website par prashn patron ke jawaab de die jaaenge
 If a student finds an answer to be incorrect, he will have to fill a form
 farm bharne ke liye 590 rupee kaa draft bhejnaa hoga
 If the student's claim turns out to be correct, then the money will be retained if the money is not returned
 is farm kaa swaroop bataata he ki agar koi ek sawaal galat he to saare chaatro ko 590 kaa draft banaakar alag alag daawey karne honge
 Claiming one or challenging one will not be considered a retaliation
 agar aisa he to yah bhayankar he
 Sheer loot
 kaayade se yah hona chahie ki agar koi chaatr sawaal karata he ki falaan prashn patr galat he, to ayog ko khud hi bataanaa chahie ki uskaa daawa sahi he yaa galat
 It is not that in order to earn money, two to four questions are being disputed in such exams because now you will find many such exams in the country, in which one to 15 and sometimes 40 questions are wrong
 sibiesai kii dasvin kii ganit kii pariksha kii taarikh ne chaatro ko kai tareeke se pareshaan kiya he
 The HR Minister will also have to decide afresh on the dates of examinations to be held after the tenth and 12th

 raveesh sar, i am Aniket Saurav (from Sitamarhi Bihar) a 10th standard student
 main pariksha de rahaa hum
 When i came home with a math paper of 10th, it came to know that the exam has been canceled and the new exam is probably on 26 April
 maine banaras hindu vidhyalay kaa farm bharaa he
 For this, a form of 406 rupees is filled
 patna se banaras kii train ke liye 470 rupee kaa tikat liya he
 If i go to 23 and catch a train to Benares on 24, then i will miss my exam
 meraa sapana tut gaya raveesh sar, baahar ke college main padhane kaa, maa baap mahangi uniwarsity main nahin padhaa sakate hai
 The dream of many children like me is broken
 ab agar pradhanmantri dukh zaahir bhi karte hai to kya faaydaa
 i am very sad, i do not feel like doing anything
 kya aap biechayu ko date aage badhaane ke liye kah sakate hai to badi krupa hogi
 Aniket Saurabh, Sitamarhi Bihar agar aisa he to maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ke dhyaan main in baton ko turant laayaa janaa chahie taaki pariksha radd hone ke kaaran chaatro ko duusari pravesh parikshaon main shaamil hone se vanchit na hona pade
 You know that Banaras Hindu School is also a part of BHU
 yahaan 11veen ke liye pravesh pariksha hoti he
 We do not even know how many such examinations take place, but if the HR Minister wants, then the students can get great relief
 30 march ko bharat sarkaar ke shiksha sachiv anil swaroop press ke saamne aae or unhone kaha ki dasvin kii ganit kii pariksha july main hogi
 If canceled, it will be done only for the areas of Haryana and Delhi
 arthshaastra kii pariksha 25 april ko hogi
 It will take 15 more days to decide on which July will take place
 shiksha sachiv kehete hai ki shikaayatein aati hai magar har shikaayat ke aadhaar par pariksha radd nahin kar sakate hai
 This is true, but it does not give an answer as to what action was taken on the complaint that came
 aaj ek chaatr saamne aayaa he, wo daawa kar rahaa he ki 17 march ko hi usne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko patr likh diya tha magar kisi ne dhyaan nahin rakhaa
 Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar has also admitted that there are several stages between printing and sending a question paper
 isliye li kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 At least they believed
 ab kah rahe hai ki ise thik karnaa hoga
 At the same time, former HRD Minister Kapil Sibal is demanding that the Prime Minister apologize to the students, but Sibal's question is something else
 wo kah rahe hai ki ab sirf ek hi prashn patr puure desh ke liye hota he, isse li hona aasaan ho gaya he
 The comments sarkaar ko ek kaam or karnaa chahie
 It can have the role of Minister of Civil Aviation and Minister of Railways
 wo yah ki sibiesai ke chaatr apana admit card dikhaakar tikat kaa puraa paisa waapas le sakate hai
 There are many parents who had ticketed to travel in India and outside India after the examination is over
 ab cancil karaayenge to unhen 40 hazaar se lekar 1 lakh tak kaa chuunaa lag saktaa he
 Since the fault is with the government, the government should make up for it
 godi media jo shiksha ke buniyadi sawaalon ko chhod kar hindu muslim tibet main aapako fansaa kar rakhana chahta he aaj kal sibiesai ke bahaane apni chhavi sudhaar rahaa he
 He is doing the news of paper leak as if he is very worried
 chintaa hoti to vah staff salection kamishan ke chaatro ne jo sawaal uthaae use bhi uthaata
 In Madhya Pradesh also talks about the students who are agitating for the Public Service Commission examination, there is a problem with the examination of Patwari
 vahaan se chaatr likh rahe hai ki patawaari kii pariksha ek privet company ne karai he
 Those who have fewer numbers are successful and those who have more are failed
 in sab baton ko ham kab gambhirtha se lenge
 Similarly, students are performing in Bengal for jobs and examinations, daily demonstrations are also held in UP, and also in Punjab
 sibiesai ke chaatro kii prishthbhumi hi he ki itnaa dhyaan mil gaya varanaa wo bhi samajhen ki shiksha vyavastha ko lekar kya haalat he desh main
 They will pass the 12th but after that how will college be
 kya sabko dilli or mumbai hi aate rahanaa hoga
 Why is there no such college in Bhopal and Patna to send someone from Delhi
 mere sawaal buniyadi hai or zaruri
 Before who wins in 2019, it is important to ask where our child will study
 kaise padhegaa
 Can any teacher or officer of major rank give 40 lakhs in two months
 zarur privet medical collejon kii fees 40 lakh 50 lakh ho gai he magar 6 lakh se badhaakar 23 lakh karnaa thik nahin tha
 If the fees were already 40 lakhs, then these people might not take admission here
 ab is faisle par raahat mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Maybe some days will be able to sleep properly, or else this decision blew her senses
 ghar bhi bechate to bhi ye fees nahin de sakate the
 The fourth and fifth year seniors have also supported the movement of their junior students
 yahi acchhee baat he
 If you look at the issues of the rights of citizens, then the pain of others will also be seen
 indian medical association ke sadasyon ne bhi chaatro kaa saath diya
 Ravinder ji, who raised this issue by creating a parent association, wants to know the answers to some more questions
 mukhyamantri ne fees vruddhi vaapasi kaa elaan to kar diya he lekin kya unhone apane cabinet kaa faisla waapas le liya
 Is there still any possibility of increasing such fees? aap raajnneeti kaa akaash dekhie, vahaan hindu muslim tanaav ke alaava koi doosraa topic nahin he
 The general public is wandering from here to there by writing their problems on the banner poster
 punjab se ek yuvak ne ek soochna di he
 CBSE students should also listen carefully
 aap jaanate hai ki online pariksha ke kuch samay baad pariksha board jawaab jari karata he, jise ancer kii kehete hai
 This allows students to match whether the answer given by them is true or false
 kai baar jawaab bhi galat hote hai
 Now if the answer is wrong, it has to be proved by the student
 wo bhi ek hi sawaal ko ek chaatr galat sabit kar de kaaphi nahin he, chaatro ne bataaya ki har chaatr ko us galat sawaal ko galat sabit karnaa hota he
 Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission exam took place this February
 15 jawaab vivaadit the
 So told the students that if they want to prove wrong then they will have to pay Rs 100 per question, that means a student will have to pay 1500 rupees, then he will be able to claim
 kya acha nahin hota ki ayog khud hi jaanch kare ki uske dwaara puche gaye sawaal or die gaye jawaab main koi kami to nahin he
 What makes sense to prove wrong by taking money from vomiting students
 punjab sarkaar to ek kadam or aage chali gai he
 The Subordinate Service Selection Board of Punjab Government has issued a notification that on April 8, the questions will be answered on the website
 kisi chaatr ko agar koi jawaab galat lagata he to use ek farm bharna hoga
 a draft of Rs 590 will have to be sent to fill the form
 agar chaatr kaa daawa sahi niklaa to paise waapas or nahin niklaa to paise rakh liye jaaenge
 The format of this form states that if any one question is wrong, then all the students will have to make different claims by making a draft of 590
 ek ke daawey karne se yaa chunauti dene sabake badale kaa daawa nahin mana jayega
 If so, it is terrible
 saraasar lut he
 It should be done that if a student questions that a particular question paper is wrong, then the commission itself should tell whether its claim is true or false
 kahin aisa to nahin ki paisa kamaane ke liye har pariksha main do chaar sawaal is tarah vivaadit rup se chhod die ja rahe hai kyonki ab aisi kai parikshaayen aapako desh bhar main milengi jinamein ek se lekar 15 or kabhi kabhi 40 prashn galat hote hai
 The CBSE Class 10 math exam date has troubled students in many ways
 maanav sansaadhan mantri ko dasvin or 12veen ke baad hone vaali parikshaon kii tarikhon ke bare main bhi nae sire se faisla karnaa hoga
 a student of class x from Sitamarhi in Bihar has written a letter which adds a new dimension to this problem
 aap bhi padhie
 
 
 Ravish sir, main aniket saurav (sitamarhi bihar se) ek 10veen kaa chaatr hum

 jab main 10veen kaa ganit kaa paper dekar ghar aayaa to pataa chalaa ki pariksha radd ho gai he or shaayad nai pariksha 26 april ko he
 i have filled the form of Banaras Hindu School
 iske liye 406 rupee kaa farm bharaa he
 a ticket of Rs 470 has been taken for the train from Patna to Banaras
 main 23 ko jaakar 24 ko banaras kaa train pakadta hum to meri pariksha chhot jaaegi
 My dream is broken Ravish sir, to study in an outside college, parents cannot teach in expensive universities
 mere jaise bahut bacchon kaa sapana tut gaya he
 Now if the Prime Minister expresses sorrow, what benefit? kaaphi dukhi hum, kuch bhi karne main man nahin lag rahaa he
 If you can ask BHU to extend the date, it would be a great blessing
 aniket saurabh, sitamarhi bihar If this is the case, then these things should be brought immediately to the notice of HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar so that students are not debarred from appearing in other entrance examinations due to cancellation of examination
