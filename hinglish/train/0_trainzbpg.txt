 Actually, this airport is built in the Flood Plain of Chengal Thodu, a tributary of the Periyar River
 1999 main jab ye bana to periyar nadi isse sirf 400 meter dur thi

 If the suggestions of this report were to be implemented, indiscriminate mining and construction work would be stopped in the entire area

 ek or cameti bana di gai jo hamaare saamne kasturirangan report kii shakl main ai
 It relaxed a lot but none of the suggestions made in this report were implemented
 kasturirangan cameti kii report ke aadhaar par paryaavaran mantralay ne pashchimi ghat ke qareeb 57 hazaar varg kilometre ilaake ko hi paryaavaran ke lihaaz se samvedansheel mana
 Mining, large construction, thermal power plants, polluting industries were completely banned in this area

 That is why there is more negligence of governments than the floods of Kerala that do not destroy nature

 a hearing was held in the Supreme Court on Friday on the sentence of Vijay Mallya, the owner of Kingfisher Airlines, which defaults on loans from banks
 court ne kaha ki maalya kii sajaa par faisla pratyrpan ke baad hi hoga
 On behalf of the government, the Attorney General said that the government is trying to extradite Mallya
 disambar tak ye prakriya puri ho jaaegi
 a status report was also filed by the Central Government during this period
 supreme court ko yah tay karnaa tha ki avmaananaa ke maamle main maalya ko kitni sajaa di jaae
 Mallya did not appear in the court despite the Supreme Court's order in the previous hearing
 itnaa hi nahin sunwaayee ke dauraan kendriya grahamantralay kii ore se koi bhi vakil court main pesh nahin hua tha
 Earlier on May 9 this year, the Supreme Court held Mallya guilty of contempt of court as he did not give full details of the property
 court ne 10 july ko supreme court main pesh hone kaa aadesh diya tha
 In fact, on April 9, the Supreme Court reserved its order against Vijay Mallya on contempt of court and US $ 40 million received by Mallya from Diego Deal
 bainkon ne maang kii he ki 40 million yues dollar jo diego deal se mili the unako supreme court kii registry main jamaa karaayaa jaae

 The Supreme Court had asked the central government how the court order could be enforced against Mallya
 tippaniyan The central government told the Supreme Court that efforts were being made to bring back Mallya
 vahiin SBI ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki maalya ke upar 9200 karod rupee kaa bakaayaa he
 Banks said - Mallya's petition should not be heard, because he is repeatedly violating the court order
 vijay maalya ne court main kaha tha ki unke paas itane paise nahin he ki ve 9200 karod rupee bank ke karz ko adaa kar paaen, kyonki unki sabhi sampattiyon ko pehle hi jabt kar liya gaya he
 During the hearing, the Supreme Court had asked Mallya whether the information you had given about your properties in the court is correct or not? Have you violated the order of Karnataka High Court? Because the Karnataka High Court had said in its order that Mallya cannot do any transaction without the permission of the court
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar se poocha tha ki maalya ke khilaaf court ke aadesh ko kaise lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 The comments centre sarkaar ne supreme court ko bataaya ki maalya ko waapas laane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 At the same time, SBI had told the Supreme Court that Mallya owes Rs 9200 crore

 There was a time when reports of suicide in India used to come from a particular area
 chhitput maamalon ko chhod den to adhiktar aatmahatyaayein gujarat ke saurashtra ilaake main hoti thim
 Then the suicide statistics here were compared to Scandinavia because at that time most people in the world committed suicide in those countries
 us vakt khudakushi ke sambhavit kaarnon par kai manovaigyanik or chikitsiya adhyayan hue the jinhen baqayada academik patrikaon main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 In the sixties and seventies a strange thing came to the fore when social researchers and journalists began to point out that the backdrop of suicides in Saurashtra was so disgusting where in most cases young wives were coerced or coerced
 iske baad se khudakushi kii dar ghatane lagi or kuch samay baad akhabaaron or patrikaon kii surkhiyon se yah vishay hi gaayab ho gaya
 Perhaps after this alleged propaganda about the families there, people may have found more secret ways of killing their wives
 bharat ke saarvajanik jivan main khudakushi kii vaapasi assi or nabbe ke dashak main hui
 Initially, suicide cases started appearing in the newspapers every week, as if they were separate incidents
 sirf kuch badnaam ho chuki swayamsevi sansthaaon, satat vikaas or jaivik kheti par kaam karne vaale chhitput andolanon or harith kranti ke aalochakon ne alag raag alaapna shuru kiya
 He drew attention to the fact that most cases of suicide were related to farmers
 inhone daawa kiya ki is baar khudakushi mahamari ban kar ai thi or yah bihar yaa uttar pradesh jaise garib rajyon main nahin balki un rajyon main fail rahi thi jahaan krishi kaa safaltaapurvak aadhunikeekaran kiya ja chukaa tha or jise purna udyogikrut krishi ke prati katibaddh shikshit or shahari bharatiyon kii saraahna mil rahi thi
 According to estimates, nearly two lakh farmers have given their lives in the last two and a half decades and most of them are from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab and Haryana
 is mahamari par janata kaa aakrosh nadaarad he
 This is seen as the 'normal' price of progress and modernization
 ek baar phir kuch manovaigyanikon or samaajavigyaniyon ne academik patrikaon main is vishay par likh maaraa he
 Some have associated the process of suicide with the changing character of psychosis in India, which shows that depression has become the biggest problem in the country
 bahut kam hi aise lekhak hai jinhone us hataasha kii padtaal kii he jo bhartiya kheti-kisaani main pichley paanch dashak main faili he-jo kabhi rus or china ke krishi kshetra kii tarah apni dridhtaa, swaavlamban or ichhashakti ke liye jaani jaati thi
 Obviously, we are now able to see a tradition of 4,000 years and the lifestyle changes that surround it
 bharat main bhrashtachar ke nidaan par indira gandhi ke vichaaron ko udhaar len, to kah sakate hai ki yah ek vaishvik parighatna he or ham iskaa kuch nahin kar sakate
 Undeclared governmental advice is advised to stay away from romantic and grassroots people studying the decline of farming lifestyle
 vaise, aadhikarik sthiti yah he ki bhartiya kisaan ab apraasangik, luptpraaya or istemaal karke phenk dene vaali cheez banate ja rahe hai
 However, the question is, can anyone really ignore the contribution of peasant lifestyle that essentially served as a resistance and cultural torch in modern India, which enabled this society to retain its originality? Is it a mere coincidence that both Gandhi and Tagore aspired to have a strong presence of a peasant element at least at the level of concept in their dream society? Can anyone forget the sixty percent of Indians who are still directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture? i suspect that the new study of Lancet magazine on suicide has a long shadow of this new epidemic, with some figures showing many The truth is well established
 ye aankade akele bharat ke nahin, china ke bhi hai
 Both these societies are witnessing a cultural explosion and erosion of civilizational values
 iskaa manovaigyanik parinaam bahut baari he
 i believe that among the few sections of segregation and marginalization in India, there are not only agriculturalists but also tribals who have been the essential departure point of our 'high' culture since ancient times
 ve bhi ab tamaam anchaahi sthitiyon se ghire khud ko achaanak apraasangik mahasoos karne lage hai
 Dismissing so many communities is not an easy task, it requires very strong psychological defense
 isamen koi aashcharya nahin hona chahie ki haal ke varshon main aae khudakushi ke tamaam maamalon se bekhbar tivi or akhabaaron par takataki lagaae bharatiyon ke maathe par koi shikan tak nahin padati
 On the other hand, psychiatrists are engaged in things like depression and self esteem, they have no meaning with ownership or isolation etc
 ve yah nahin samaj pate ki hataasha ke behad ilaakon kaa viparyay aadhunik bharat main atmarati ke failte ilaakon se ho rahaa he, jiske chashme se hataasha darasal kuch gadabad vyaktiyon dwaara paidaa kiye gaye asantosh ke rup main dikhti he
 This self-creation creates a closed and suffocating real or virtual world whose basic principles are to be eternally entertained, to be in constant contact and to remain eternally young
 jaahir he, aisi duniya se khudakushi or hataasha ke ilaake bahut, bahut dur hai
 Ashish Nandi is a social psychologist

 Not only this, the flock of people stood ahead to get a glimpse of Rahul
 jisase vahaan avyavashtha kaa maahaul pehle hi ban gaya tha
 Rahul said during the meeting here that PM Narendra Modi has forgotten his promises after coming into government
 main alag-alag rajyon main jaakar kisaanon se mila
 Farmers are forced to work along with farming
 maine sansad main sawaal poocha tha ki kisaan ko jo rate miltaa he
 Why is there so much difference between him and the market rate? The farmer gives 40 rupees and there is 200 rupees pulses in the market
 yah kiski jeb main ja rahaa he, kisaanon or kharidne waalon kii jeb main nahin ja rahaa he
 It is going into the middlemen's pocket
 maine piem modi se kaha ki kisaanon kii raksha kiijie
 The farmer gives food to the country
 jab hamaari sarkaar thi to hamane kisaanon kaa 70 hajaar karod kaa karj maaf kiya tha
 Rahul said that PM Modi has forgiven big industrialists of more than 50 thousand crore rupees
 agar aap bade logon kaa karj maaf karnaa chaahate hai to kiijie, lekin kisaan kaa bhi kiijie
 Electricity bills are a problem for farmers
 aap use aadha kyon nahin karte
 When we had a government, we helped the laborers with the MNREGA and helped the farmers by waiving loans

 Rahul is accompanied by senior party leader and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad

 i met farmers in different states
 kisaan kheti karne ke saath mazdooree karne ko majaboor hai
 i asked the question in Parliament that the rate that the farmer gets
 usamen or market rate main itnaa fark kyon? kisaan 40 rupye main detaa he or market main 200 rupye kii daal hoti he
 In whose pocket it is going, not in the pocket of farmers and buyers
 yah bichauliyon kii jeb main ja rahaa he
 i asked PM Modi to protect the farmers

 sthaan javeri bazaar, mumbai
 As usual, everything was normal in the Zaveri Bazaar in Oprah House area of mumbai
 roj kii tarah dukaanon ke shater khul rahe the or chaay kii gumtiyon par hameshaa kii tarah bheed lagi thi
 Suddenly a CBI raid in a jeweler's shop
 lekin tab koun jaanata ki sibiai or inakam tex ke naam se padaa ye chapa nakli tha
 It is said that for two to three hours neither one was able to go inside the shop nor was able to come outside the shop
 sibiai or inakam tex ke chaape ke naam par chor luteron ne dukaan khaali kar di
 Adorned with stars like Akshay Kumar, Anupam Kher Manoj Bajpayee, the film 'special 26' is inspired by this event
 'a vednesade' jaisi film banane vaale diarector niraj pandey kii ye film special isliye he kyonki aaj tak duniya ye nahin jaan paayi ki wo koun 26 log the jinhone chapa maaraa or ajtak unamem se kisi kaa suraag nahin mila
 Till date, the team reached to investigate this story of 'special 26' in the area where this fake raid was conducted and discovered those who had seen 'special 26' live about 25 years ago
 ye wo log he jinhone un super thagon ko apni ankhon se dekha he jinhen aaj parade par akshay kumaar, anupam kher or unki team nibhaa rahi he
 Believe me the area did not even get wind
 unhen agle din akhbaar or televijan dekhakar pataa chalaa unke ilaake kaa johari lut gaya
 There were 26 people raiding
 saare ke saare farji
 But there was amazing synergy, no one weak link hit anyone
 thagi ke itihaas main itnaa shaatir thag ki duniya ko ajtak uski surat to chhodie uskaa naam tak nahin pataa
 It has been 25 years for those super thugs
 ab to sirf baaten hi bachi hai
 Only stories are told of those thugs
 to kya us vaardaat kaa koi bhi police record nahin he? 25 saal purana cese he
 There is no trace of the file of that 'special 26' case now in the DB Marg Police Station in Mumbai
 police kahati he hamaare paas is vakt sirf 20 saal purana record hi he
 But yes, it is true that a case was registered against unknown people under various concurrent sections like sections 420, 471 and 34 of IPC
 pehle is maamle kii tafteesh police ne kii or phir maamla 1987 ko sibiai ko transfar kar diya gaya
 And gave the task of investigating the case to the then CBI Crime Branch officer Sonar
 sibiai bhi hawa main haath pair chalaa kar rah gai
 But the smell of vicious thugs was also not found
 jaahir he police ab us bare main baat kare to kya kare
 But yes, he did tell that this fake raid file dated 19 March 1987 has been kept in a category i
e
 the case was registered but the investigation could not reach any result
 super thagon ne puri taiyaari kar rakhi thi
 He had a list of leaders and businessmen who had huge black money
 shaayad yahi vajah he unke sirf teraa maamle hi saamne aa paye 
 The rest of them know how many people they looted
 80 kaa dashak kaledhan rakhanevaale rajaneta or kaarobaariyon ke liye kisi musiibat se kam nahin tha kyonki thag acchhee tarah jaanate the unke karatuut kii shaayad hi koi police main shikaayat kare
 It was only speculated about those thugs that no one could have been a retired CBI officer in those Special 26
 koi ritaryad inakam tex officer
 Otherwise who knows how much cash and how much property they have
 hadakamp itnaa much gaya ki sarkaar kalaadhan nikaalane ke tareeke khojane lagi thi
 The most interesting anecdote of Special 26 is that once in a cheat, he also involved the real police officer in his operation
 or jab tak asli pulisavaalon ko ye pataa chalata ki thagon ne usase bhi apane aparaadh main shaamil kiya tha tab tak uske paanv ke neeche se jameen khisak chuki thi
 The shocking thing was that the team that was formed for Special 26 was advertised in the newspaper
 kehete hai jin logon ko us super thag ne apane oparation main shaamil kiya unako tak is baat kii bhanak nahin thi ki sibiai ke naam par unase farji chapa maravaaya ja rahaa tha
 Leader or businessman
 jo chor hoga vahi daregaa
 For the same fear, the thugs made their weapons and the fugitives took their nefarious wealth in their name and hid in a world where no one dared to reach
 or agar karte to pataa nahin or kya-kya raaj khul jate
 Perhaps this is the reason that those cases of cheating of the eighties are still in the a category, ie, which did not yield any results

 If India has not kept nuclear bomb for Diwali, it's obvious Pakistan's not kept theirs for Eid either
 Don't know why PM Modi must stoop so low & reduce political discourse to this
 Let me tell you that a day ago PM Modi (PM Narendra Modi) said, 'india gave up its policy of fearing the threats of Pakistan, is it right? Do you want this too? We created fear in the minds of the terrorists, did it fix it? We took out all the arrogance of Pakistan, forced it to roam with the bowl, right? # WATCH Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Barmer, Rajasthan: India has stopped the policy of getting scared of Pakistan's threats
 Every other day they used to say "we've nuclear button, we've nuclear button"

 isi kaaran prashasan kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki baadh ke chalate naalon ke pani ko yamuna main nahin choda jayega

 Water from the drain coming from Kingsway Camp in Yamuna has started to be released again in Yamuna

 Rudy said that when he made this statement in Kolkata, the BJP Parliamentary Board in Delhi was considering three options, including sitting in the opposition, regarding the fractured mandate of Jharkhand
 anya vikalp the sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan dena yaa sarkaar main shaamil hona
 Giving clarification in the context of his controversial statement, he said that the party had not reached any decision till then
 unhone kaha ki in teenon main se ek vilalp chunane kaa kaary jharkhand kaa daura kar rahe party ke kendriya netritv or rajya netritv par chhod diya gaya tha
 In his explanation, he said that after taking stock of the ground reality, it was decided to form a government consisting of JMM and Ajsu

 It was said by the government that the government is not going to take any decision related to reducing the age limit of the students taking UPSC exams

 a government official said that before any decision is implemented for the previous government, it will be reviewed

 a conclusion drawn on the basis of the experience behind Nitish Kumar's attempts to stay away from the pangs of the alliance is that Nitish will not be affected by the departure of Upendra Kushwaha even though he believes that as long as the BJP at the Center As long as the government is there, Manjhi will not go with Lalu Prasad Yadav at least
 udhar, agar unke bete santosh maanjhi kaa raajnneetik edjastment ho gaya, to vah apni party kaa vilay BJP main hi kar sakate hai
 Secondly, Nitish also believes that as long as Ram Vilas Paswan is also with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the NDA candidates in Bihar should have no dilemma or trouble in winning, as when Paswan is against the NDA Even with Lalu, the NDA had won the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, and now Paswan is also opposed to the RJD

 Nitish Kumar's detractors also believe that the CM has sent a message with his statement that when he did not bow down to Lalu, now he does not want to become the leader of the coalition under the pressure of Manjhi and Kushwaha, one MLA each

 us dauraan unhone kai sanghathan or sarkaar ke kai project ko kamyaabi ke saath puraa kiya tha
 Another leader from Maharashtra, Nitin Gadkari, who had done the same, had got his iron face during the Legislative Council membership

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke vynad loksabhaa seat (kerala) se bhi chunaav ladane ke faisle par siyaasi bayaanbaji lajimi he
 But the fact is that Rahul is not fighting from here only because it is a safe seat for Congress
 jyotish se lekar, raajnneetik mudde or congress party ko majboot dikhaane kii vajah se hi congress adhyaksh ne yah seat apane liye chuni he
 Rahul Gandhi's closest strategists say that the Congress president had made up his mind to contest elections from Wayanad only in December last year
 rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main congress kii jeet ke baad purv raksha mantri or kerala ke purv mukhyamantri eke antni ne rahul ko yah salaah di thi
 In January this year, Rajasthan's famous astrologer advised Rahul Gandhi that South India is lucky for the Congress party
 isse pehle bhi 1977 main congress jab satta se baahar ho gai to 1980 main jyotishon ke salaah par hi indira gandhi dakshin ke rajya andhra pradesh (maujuuda telugana) ke madak seat se jeetin or congress ne satta hasil kii
 After this, the then Congress President Sonia Gandhi won from Bellary in Karnataka in 1999
 haalanki congress kii satta main vaapasi nahin hui or use 2004 tak satta paane ke liye intjaar karnaa padaa
 After being out of power for the last five years, the Congress is once again hoping for a change of fortune from South India
 jyotish ke alaava siyaasi lihaaj se bhi vynad, rahul gandhi ke liye dakshin bharat main ek maatr vikalp bachaa tha
 There were two punches in fighting a seat in both the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu
 pehla pench tha in donon rajyon ke bich kaveri jal-vivaa da kaa hona
 If Rahul had fought from either of these two states, the opposition would have raised the issue of Cauvery water dispute
 aise main rahul gandhi ke liye kisi bhi rajya kaa paksh lenaa mushkil hota
 The other problem is that if Rahul were to fight either of these two states, then the message would have been that since the Congress is not able to win on its own in the southern states
 isliye rahul gandhi yahaan apane sahyogi dalon (jedies or diemke) ke sahare chunaav ladane aae hai
 Andhra Pradesh is not a safe state for Rahul because people here consider the Congress responsible for the partition

 iran kahata rahaa he ki uskaa parmaanu kaarykram puri tarah se asainya he or iske sarvocch netaa ayatollah khamenei ne november main chetaya tha ki agar america parmaanu samjhaute kaa ulanghan karata he to tehran palatwaar karegaa
 Tillerson also sought support on the idea that the US forcefully combat Iran's destabilizing behavior in West Asia
 unhone tehran ko aatankwaad ko pryojit karne vaala ek pramukh desh bhi qaraar diya
 He said it is clear from the evidence that the provocation of Iran is a threat to America, the region and the world
 tilorsan ne kaha ki aisi sambhaavna he ki aniyantrit iran usee raste par chalaa he jis par uttar korea chalaa he or duniya ko bhi isapar saath le ja saktaa he
 America is eager to ignore the other evidence

 swatchta abhiyaan ke dauraan khule main shouch ko lekar jafar khan ke maut ke maamle main bhale hi jaanch kii baat mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje twitor par kar rahi hai magar hamaari padtaal main jaanch ke naam par lipapoti hi saamne ai he
 SFL report to be revealed: Zafar's family has accused five government employees of beating Zafar
 magar police kah rahi he ki ham koi bhi jaanch or karrwai SFL report milane ke baad hi karenge, kyonki doctoron ne likhaa he ki maut ke kaarnon kaa asli vajah SFL jaanch ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 But when we asked about the report of the Director of SFL, we said that the police has not sent any letter for quick investigation report and without the police letter, we will send the report in one to one and a half months in the normal process i
e
 by then the police Will not take any action on anyone
 paanch logon par darj hua he hatya kaa maamlapratapgarh main khule main shouch ko lekar hue jhagade main jafar khan kii maut ke maamle main abtak koi karrwai nahin hui he
 Zafar's family has registered a case of murder against five people
 maukey par darjanon chashmadidon ke maujuud hone kaa video bhi he
 But police say that heart attack is the cause of death in the post-mortem report, so we are not arresting anyone and will take further action only after the SFL report is received
 yahaan tak kii police kisi bhi chashmadid kaa bayaan bhi nahin kiya he jabaki viral hue video main chashmadid saaf dikh rahe hai
 The video was done in pieces, Viralpolis says that we have not seen the video
 pratapgarh ke espi shivaraj meena ne kaha ki SFL report kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The big question is, where is the full video of the 16-second video showing Rajasthan's Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria and the police
 nagarpalika kii taraf se jab puraa videography karai gai he to sarkaar 16 or 21 second kaa vahiin tukdaa kyon viral kar rahi he jisamen jafar hamalaa karata dikhaai de rahaa he
 What's in the rest of the video that the police and the government are hiding
 final report se pataa chalegi maut kii vajahpostmortem report ke bare main hamane jab postmortem karanevaale doctor se baat kii to unhone kaha ki hamane to sahi report di he
 We do not have any further testing facilities in Pratapgarh, hence sent to sfl's Udaipur lab
 final report ke baad hi maut kii vajahon kaa pataa chal paaegaa
 After the India Today sting, the questions are being raised on the question: Jairam Daima, in-charge of the hospital, admitted in our sting that the cause of any death is heart and lung failure, so we have not been able to find anything from this post-mortem
 isliye sabhi ang hamane udaipur ke ennesail lab main bheja he
 Questions are being raised on the post-mortem report because in India Today's sting operation, Kamlesh Doshi, the bjp's chairman of Pratapgarh, admitted that he had built a post-mortem board of five people
 report aane main lagenge dedh maheene kaa samayusake baad hamane aage kii padtaal ke liye udaipur ke prayogshaala ke diarector se baatcheet kii
 After going there, it was found that the police was throwing dust in the eyes of the people in the name of investigation
 SFL ke diarector rameshchandra sharma ne bataaya ki medical legal cese main hamen police patr likhti he to ham ek do din main report de dete hai magar hamen is cese main police se koi patr nahi mila he isliye samaanya process main ek dedh maheene report dene main lag jaaenge
 Questions raised on the video: In this whole issue, questions are also being raised on the video that is going viral on behalf of the administration and the BJP, why are they releasing special videos in pieces
 maukey par maujuud jafar kii beti kaa kahana he ki puri ghatana kaa video jila parishad ke karmchaaree ne video banaaya tha to phir police puure video kii jaanch kyon nahin karti he

 9 may ko 16 ladaaku vimaan, jinamein bhartiya nausena ke 8 mig-29 or france ke 8 rafel-em vimaan shaamil the, karnataka main arab sagar ke tat par aapas main 'takaraae'
 The fighters divided into two groups, each with 8 aircraft, knew their role clearly
 ek samooh, jise strike force kaa naam diya gaya, use karwaar ke paas ek chote dweep ko rocketon, bamon or goliyon se nishaanaa banane kii koshish kerani thi to duusare samooh yani defensive force jisamen 8 mig or rafel shaamil the, ko biond vijual range se strike force ke hamale ko rokane kii koshish kerani thi, isse pehle ki wo apane hathiyaar chalaa bhi saken
 Both the aircraft carrier De Gaulle and Vikramaditya were the centers of bilateral naval exercise 'varuna'

 The 'varuna 2019', which began with aerial maneuvers close to the coast of Karnataka, ended with submarine maneuvers in the Horn of Africa, where the French Navy has a base
 enditivi se baat karne vaale varisht nausena adhikariyon ne kaha ki hawaii yuddh abhyaas ne 'asaadhaaran prashikshan mulya' ko joda, jisamen karwaar par ek chote se dweep par hamalaa kiya gaya
 The exercise ended with fighter jets from both sides attacking the target along the rocky shores of the island
 is abhyaas kaa uddeshy tha saamaanya sanchaar protocol viksit karnaa taaki kisi bhi takaraav ke vakt francisi or bhartiya nausainya ladaaku vimaan saath main kaam kar saken
 However, the differences in basic operations still persist
 bhartiya mig-29 ke main laga electronic data-link france ke rafel vimaanon main lage samaan system ke anukool nahin tha
 Due to this, the entire conversation between the Indian and French aircraft took place via radio
 bhartiya nausena ke adhikariyon ne NDTV ko bataaya ki donon pakshon dwaara 'ganari eksrasij' behad safal rahi or donon hi pakshon ne safaltaapurvak apane lakshya ko nishaanaa banaaya
 Naval officials did not share details of the skirmish between the Indian Navy's mig-29k and French Rafale aircraft
 ye sabhi abhyaas 60 se 80 kilometre ke biond vijual range par kiye gaye jisamen bhartiya nausena ne bataaya ki wo kahin unnat rafel ladaaku vimaanon kaa pataa lagane or unase loha lene main kaamyaab rahe, haalanki in abhyaason ke scoreline is samvaadadaata se saza nahin kiye gaye
 Naval sources, however, have always told NDTV that the two navies were not directly confronted in any exercise and the two sides decided to deploy joint forces for maximum mutual reconciliation
 bhartiya vayusena ko 36 rafel ladaaku vimaanon main se kuch isi varsh sitambar main mil jaaenge
 Prior to that, the Indian Air Force would send its Sukhoi-30 fighter jets with air-refueling aircraft to France in early July for the 'garuda' Air Force exercise between the two countries

 It has now been decided that the CPM will contest elections in Bengal along with the Congress to take on the TMC in the Bengal elections
 ye ittefaq hi he ki mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne guuruuvaar ko jab dilli main party ke chanakya kahe jane vaale harkishan singh surajeet ke naam par sipiem ke nae vaicharik skool ke bhawan kaa shilanyas kiya or ye bayaan bhi diya ki bengal main mamata banerjee ko haraane ke liye sabhi loktantric or secular partiyaan saath aaen
 The question is whether the party will join hands with Congress to defeat TMC in Bengal elections
 sipiem ke mahasachiv ke bayaan or central cameti kii meeting ke baad huye faisle se saaf he ki sipiem congress se haath milaane kii majaburi ke aage jhuk gai he
 Last week, the Bengal unit of the CPM agreed to join hands with the Congress to avoid the division of votes in the fight against the Trinamool Congress
 lekin samasya he ki bengal ke saath-saath kerala vidhansabha chunaav bhi ho rahe hai jahaan left kii takkar sidhe congress se honi he
 Comrades from Kerala are saying how friendship will happen in one state and competition in another
 tippaniyan It is believed that the Congress and the Left will fight together but there will be no formal announcement
 kuch siten ek duusare ke liye chodi jaaengi or kuch siton par tiemasi ko haraane ke liye donon hi chunaav ladenge
 This is part of the strategy
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sipiem mahasachiv yechuri or congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi main is bare main baat chuki he lekin sawaal ye bhi he ki kya sonia gandhi mamata banerjee ko naaraaz karne kaa jokhim uthaaengi
 However, Mamata Banerjee is very strong in Bengal at the moment and it is being said that despite this alliance, her health is not going to be affected
 phir bhi bengal ke kamred kah rahe hai ki rajya main dharashayi ho chuki sipiem ko kuch oxizan chaiye jiske liye ye gathjod zaruri he
 It is clear from the statement of the CPM general secretary and the decision taken after the meeting of the Central Committee that the CPM has succumbed to the compulsion to join hands with the Congress
 pichley hafte sipiem kii bengal unit ne congress se haath milaane ke maamle main sahmati jataai thi taaki trinmul congress ke khilaaf ladaai main voton kaa bantwaaraa na ho
 But the problem is that along with Bengal, the Kerala Assembly elections are going on where the Left will have to compete directly with the Congress
 kerala ke kamred kah rahe hai ki ek rajya main dosti or duusare main muqabla kaise hoga
 The comments isaliye mana ja rahaa he ki congress auki left milakar ladenge lekin koi aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin hogi
 Some seats will be left for each other and in some seats both will contest elections to defeat TMC
 ye ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 It is being said that CPM General Secretary Yechury and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi have talked about this, but the question is whether Sonia Gandhi will take the risk of making Mamata Banerjee angry
 vaise bengal main mamata banerjee is vakt siyaasi rup se kaaphi majboot hai or kaha ja rahaa he ki is gathbandhan ke baavjood unki sehat par koi bada asar nahin padane vaala he
 Nevertheless, the comrades of Bengal are saying that the collapsed CPM in the state needs some oxygen, for which these alliances are necessary

 Pratyusha Banerjee's suicide news has once again shaken the colorful world of glamor
 ek baar phir ye sawaal kachotane laga he ki kya tadak-bhadak kii jindagi kaa anjaam tanhai or akelepan ke taur par hi saamne aata he? or kya naakaami or gumnami hi aksar maut kii vajah ban jaati he?15 din pehle daalaa maut se judaa whatsap stateskai baar ittefaq bhi hota he jab amuman log aisi baaten fasebuk yaa watsape par apane states main likh dete hai
 Pratyusha's whatsapp status 'mar Ke Bhi Mouth Na Tujhse Folding' is on March 15
 yani uski maut se 15 din pehle kaa
 Now the question is, is this status a mere coincidence or is it the secret of the death of the bride bridegroom Anandi, Pratyusha Banerjee, in this one line? The glare of this shining world has brought more people to fame
 Is pushed into the dark well of ruin
 yahaan kaamyaab logon ko log sir ankhon par bithaate hai, or tanha yaa naakaam logon ko apane bich se uthaa kar aisa phenkate hai ki phir naa wo sapanom kii is duniya main ji pate hai or naa hamaari or aapaki duniya main
 But what happened to Anandi that she wrote to die 15 days before death? What was the reason for suicide? Did the darkness of loneliness swallow up Pratyusha even in the midst of the glamorous glamor world? Did 24-year-old Pratyusha give up her heartbeat after fear of falling to the ground due to the height of fame and fear of failure and anonymity? Was Pratyusha broken due to bad financial condition? Or has Pratyusha betrayed the relationship? After all, with whom did Pratyusha not turn her face? Is that her boyfriend? Why was Pratyusha fighting with her boyfriend before death? Did Pratyusha doubt that her boyfriend loves another girl? No suicide note Pratyusha died suddenly
 maut kii khabar se har koi sann he
 All are in the can
 marane se pehle pratyusha ne koi suicide note bhi nahin choda
 In such a situation, the police will directly address every doubt and question before closing the case
 or tatol bhi rahi he
 And standing at the forefront of this doubt and question is the same boyfriend of Pratyusha whom some people are also telling his fiancée
 naam he rahul raaj
 Pratyusha's boyfriend with whom Pratyusha last spoke before dying
 jiske saath wo aakhri baar dekhi gai thi
 The last time she fought with
 or jo pratyusha kii maut ke baad sabase pehle uske paas pahunchaa tha
 Which means that Pratyusha's death was first reported
 to sawaal anginat hai
 Answer: Every lover of Anandi wants to know
 koi teesraa to nahin bana karanmumbai police kii ab tak kii jo tafteesh saamne ai he usamen pratyusha or uske bwyfriend rahul ke bich ek teesri ladki kaa zikr aa rahaa he
 It is because of that girl that bitterness in their relationship is also being revealed
 or saamne ye bhi aa rahaa he ki usee ladki kii vajah se pratyusha ne apana aakhri states rahul ke liye hi likhaa tha
 pratyusha-rahulabat used to live in a live-in relationship
 pratyusha kanchpada ilaake se shift hokar isi saal janvari main hi bangurnagar ke hormonic racidency apartment ke flats number 703 main rahane ai thi
 Pratyusha and her boyfriend Rahul lived here
 yani donon liv-in-relationships main the
 In early March, a girl named Saloni came to this apartment
 rahul se milane
 It is said that Pratyusha had a big fight with Saloni then
 yahaan tak ki hathapayee bhi hui
 Later, the apartment people also called the police due to the quarrel
 ye maamla baguranagar thane main aaj bhi darj he
 There was a fight between Pratyusha and Rahul
 Actually Pratyusha suspected that Rahul has an affair with Saloni
 or isi baat ko lekar donon main hameshaa jhagada bhi hota rahata tha
 Rahul was with Pratyusha in the same flat on the night of 31 March
 us raat or phir agali subah yani ek march ko bhi pratyusha ke flats se jhagade kii aawaaj baahar aa rahi thi
 After this, Rahul and Pratyusha left the house at around ten in the morning of March 1
 donon saath main ghar ke paas hi ek chota sa mal he vahaan gaye
 It is said that both of them also got into a fight there
 jhagade kii jad main is baar bhi vahi saloni naam kii ladki thi
 After the quarrel, the two came home together and then after some time Rahul left the house alone
 ye un donon kii aakhri mulaakaat thi
 After this, at about half past eleven in the morning, the laundry lady came to the house
 tab pratyusha ne ghar kaa darwaja kholaa tha
 But after that no one saw Pratyusha again
 shaam ke chaar baje jab rahul flats par waapas lautaa
 He rang the bell for a long time but did not open the door
 pratyusha ghar se baahar bhi nahin nikali thi or phone bhi pick nahin kar rahi thi
 Therefore, Rahul invites a keyman from nearby and opens the door with him
 tab sosayadi kaa guard bhi maujuud tha
 After seeing Pratyusha hanging, Rahul opens the door and when Rahul reaches inside, he sees Pratyusha swinging in the bedroom with a fan
 wo fouran use neeche utaarata he
 He feels that Pratyusha's breath is still going on
 lihaaja wo turant use lekar paas ke kokilaben aspataal bhaagta he
 But Pratyusha had died before reaching the hospital
 tab shaam ke kareeb paanch baje the
 After this, Rahul first informs Pratyusha's uncle
 police ko haadase kii khabar shaam kareeb saat baje milti he
 For the last few days, the condition of the gardener was not good, the police have long questioned Rahrahul
 pratyusha ke saath uske rishton se lekar, shaadi, us duusari ladki or donon kii mali haalat ko lekar
 Now if the Mumbai Police is to be believed, since March 2015, both Pratyusha and Rahul's career was almost downhill
 balika vadhu kii anandi ban kar jo pratyusha raaton-raat ghar-ghar kii chaheti ban gai thi, usee anandi ke kirdaar se baahar aate hi achaanak sab badal gaya
 The financial condition of both of them was also not good for the last several months
 agar police kii tafteesh k line len to philhal police har angel se maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 It also includes murder
 or isaki vajah ye he ki jis flats main pratyusha rahati thi us daravaaje kaa taala andar or baahar donon se khul saktaa he

 Behind this order, the Army believes that allowing the wearing of medals will bring a sense of pride to the martyrs and the kin of ex-servicemen and through this, they can pay tribute to the martyrs

 cricket bhi baaki khelon kii tarah hi ek aisa khel he, jiske udbhav ke baad se usamen kai format, niyam, or style badale gaye
 
 
 Nowadays, cricket is played in three formats at the international level, in which all the countries playing are given different rankings
 
 
 is vakt test or tii-20 formaton main dakshin africa kii team sheersh par he, or vah ek abhootpurv itihaas rachane kii kagaar par he
 
 
 With just one win, the South African team will be the first team in the world to top the three formats of the game at the same time
 
 
 mangalvaar ko southampton ke rose ball stadium main mezbaan england ke khilaaf khele jane vaale shrunkhlaa ke duusare ek-divasiy antarrashtriya match main yadi jeet dakshin africa ne hasil kar lee, to vah van-de cricket main bhi number-1 team ban jaaegi
 
 
 It is noteworthy that the South African team already tops Test cricket and T20 cricket with 120 and 130 rating points respectively, while in the one-day Rankings, they are equal to England with 121 points
 
 
 vaise, test or tii-20 ranking main bhi dakshin africa kaa sabase bada pratidwandvi england hi he, or vah kramshah 117 or 129 ankon ke saath duusare sthaan par he, jabaki tisare sthaan par test maichon main 116 ke saath australia maujuud he, or tii-20 maichon main 119 ankon se saath srilanka tisare sthaan par kabiz he
 
 
 So now if South Africa's team becomes No
1 in one-day as well, it will be the first time in the history of ICC Ranking, when only one team will top all three formats of the game at the same time
 
 
 tippaniyan South Africa coach Gary Kirsten, who led Team India to the top of the Test rankings and won the 2011 World Cup under his leadership, took charge of his country's team a year ago, and only then did the strategy to top the team in every format Was made 
 
 usee ranneeti ke tahat team main kai yuva or anbhavi khilaadiyon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 
 
 Not only this, Kirsten also added great confidence to the South African team, and he managed his mission in Tests and T-20s
 
 
 ab unki baari he van-de main badshahath kaayam karne kii, or bahut saaf dikhaai de rahaa he ki coach gairi karston or captain greem smith kii 'kamaal kii jodi' apane is mishan ke liye bhi puri tarah taiyaar he
 
 
 With just one win, the South African team will be the first team in the world to top the three formats of the game at the same time

 ' team india ne firozshah kotla maidan par khele gaye chauthe test match main dakshin africa ko 337 ranon se haraa diya
 On Monday, on the fifth day of the final Test of the four-match series, Indian bowlers chased down a target of 481 runs to put the visiting team's innings on 143 runs
 iske saath hi team india ne chaar test maichon kii siries 3-0 se jeet lee
 India had won the Mohali (first) and Nagpur (third) Tests in just three days, while the Bangalore Test was rained out
 chaliye aapako bataate hai wo paanch kaaran jisaki vajah se kotla main team india ko jeet mili
 Rahane's 'double' Team India batting in the first innings of the Kotla Test was faltered
 pehle 50 overs ke khel ke dauraan hi captain kohli samet chah khilaadi pavilion laut gaye the
 Ajinkya Rahane, standing at the other end, played the cricket from here which will play a big role in furthering his stature in the coming days
 rahane tab 55 gendon par 31 ran bana kar khel rahe the
 From here he took the reins and then gave a century, giving the best introduction of moderation
 is dauraan unhone ravindra jadeja ke saath 7wein wicket ke liye 59 ran (18
 5 overs) and 32 with Ravichandran Ashwin for the 8th wicket
 1 overs main 98 ranon kii saajhedaari nibhaai
 Team India, who had lost six wickets for a total of 136 runs, managed to score 296 and eventually 334 runs until the dismissal of India Rahane
 spin leti wicket par yah bada score hi jeet kii neenv rakh gaya
 Rahane also scored a century in the second innings
 is dauraan unhone kohli ke saath paanchave wicket ke liye 154 ranon kii saajhedaari kii
 Virat Kohli, who landed for captaincy for the first time on his home ground, had said in the tone before the start of this Test that he would remain ruthless and try to win the series 3–0
 or test ke dauraan unhone na keval ek captain ke taur par balki ek ballebaaj ke rup main bhi ise sabit kiya
 Kohli had a very important character in this test
 unhone pehali pari main rahane ke saath 70 ranon kii ahm saajhedaari kii or phir duusari pari main 154 ranon kii
 Kohli, who scored only 68 runs in the first three Tests at an average of 17, scored 132 runs during this Test alone
 is test ke dauraan bhi wo aakraamak bane rahe
 During the fielding, he decorated the attacking fielding in front of batsmen like Amla and de Villiers
 kohli ne sili point, sili mid of par fielders khadey kiye or in ballebaajon ko ek ek ran ke liye tarasaa diya
 His attacking fielding decor and the tight bowling of Jadeja, Ashwin and Yadav have led to many unwanted records of slow batting by South African batsmen in an effort to save the match
 spin kindosvinaspin viketon par aswin ne apane aagaaj kii ghoshnaa to srilanka daure par hi kar di thi
 There he became the man of the series with 21 wickets in a series of three tests, and here he was entitled to this award with 31 wickets in a series of four tests
 keval 12 test siries khelkar aswin ne yah karnama paanchavin baar kiya
 With this, he equaled the record for the most man of the series of any Indian cricketer
 yah record virendra sahvaag (38 siries) or sachin tendulkar (74 siries) ke naam darj he
 During this Test, he has already become the highest wicket-taker in any series against the African team
 kotla par yah aswin kaa teesraa test tha or is test ko milakar wo yahaan 23 wicket le chuke hai
 He became the fastest bowler to take 150 Test wickets in the last Sri Lanka series
 wo jis tarah prayek test ke baad apane viketon kii sankhya main vruddhi kar rahe hai usase yah saaf lagane laga he ki agle kuch maichon main hi wo sabase tej 200 wicket lene vaale bhartiya gendbaaj bhi ban jaaenge
 He has taken 176 wickets in 32 Tests
 jadeja ko mili nai pahachaanchaar test maichon kii siries main jahaan ek ore aswin ne liye 31 wicket liye vahiin duusari chor se ‘sar’ jadeja chhaae rahe
 On the Mohali pitch, Jadeja, who started dancing to African batsmen on his spin, continued in Kotla
 is test kii donon hi pariyon main unhone ne keval captain hashim amala ke wicket liye balki pehali pari main paanch wicket samet kul saat khilaadiyon ko chalata kiya
 What he bowled in the second innings is less to be praised
 duusari pari main jadeja ko africa ballebaajon ne is kadar rakshaatmak khelaa ki unhone 46 main se 33 overs medne phenke
 It was a miracle of Jadeja's tight bowling that Captain Amla opened the account on 53 balls with 46 balls while du Plessis played 52 balls to open the account
 duusari ore sabase tej shatak ke liye mashhoor divilliars bhi 220 gendon par 33 ran banaae
 Jadeja has made his new identity by taking 23 wickets during the entire series
 yadav kii wicket-tu-wicket gendbajidusri pari main umesh yadav kii gendbaaji ne dikhaa diya ki agar aapaki gendbaaji main dhar he to wo keval hari pattee kii mohataaj nahin hoti
 On a spin-taking wicket, Yadav defeated the African batsmen, who were adept at playing fast bowling, with their speed
 aswin-jadeja kii jodi ne jahaan shuruaati ballebaajon ko out kiya vahiin yadav ne tail kii safai kii
 Yadav took two in the first innings and three in the second
 duusari pari main yadav ne avismaraneey gendbaaji kaa pradarshan kiya
 While the African batsmen were troubled by Jadeja's spin-taking balls on one side, Yadav longed for one run
 yadav ne is dauraan 21 overs phenke or africa ballebaaj unki phenki gai keval chah gendon par ran banane main kaamyaab rahe
 That is, their economy is only 0 with 120 dot balls

 Holding his mandate in his hand, he smiled and came back, framed with his hero
 kaash main bhi mil aata! The event was to begin at 5 pm
 main 5 bajkar 3 minute par pahunchaa
 There were a few people outside the auditorium besides the welcome officer
 pahunchate hi laga ki kahin sabase pehle to nahin aa gaya
 Welcoming officer friend Anil told that all the people are inside
 governor sahab thik 5 baje aa gaye or manch par baith hue hai
 On hearing this, i felt myself why it was delayed by three minutes
 mujhe bhi deree se chidh he
 The hall was packed but the effect was such that Rajan was sitting on every seat
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki main bhi usee kautuhal se rajan ko dekh rahaa tha, jisase baaqi dekh rahe the
 After his departure, the famous poet Ashok Chakradhar clearly said that i will not get up from the chair on which Governor Rajan was sitting
 maine kisi santhaan ke chaparasi se lekar adhikari tak main apane mukhiya ke prati aisa aakarshan nahin dekha he
 Something has happened within the Reserve Bank of India that has made Rajan truly a Rajan
 reserve bank kii garima hameshaa se rahi he, lekin rajan kaa kuch to asar hua he, jiske kaaran manzole str ke adhikariyon kaa aatmgaurav chhalak rahaa tha
 i began to hear with my ears what people talk about Rajan
 har awaz main sakaaraatmakataa thi
 In conversation, when i said that the discussion is that the next governor could be someone else, then the people around got small
 "hamaare sahab bahut achche hai"
 We sit and work in the office
 unke kaam karne se sara reserve bank kaam karata he
 The files keep running
 sabase baat bahut achche se karte hai
 They keep themselves back
 ham logon ko aage kar dete hai
 The talent is there, the men are very good
 governor sahab har chiz par nazar rakhte hai
 He worries that everyone should get two days of bread
 kisi ke saath dhokhadhadi na ho
 These are the few voices i heard from different people about Raghuram Rajan
 maine kisi se puch diya ki rajan ko hindi aati he
 i was told to take time out with a very junior officer and discuss in Hindi
 vah bhi banking vishyon par
 When he called a journalist a fiscal deficit, he felt that he had not listened wrong
 jab duusare vaktaa bol rahe the tab manch par raghuram rajan apane bhaashan kaa abhyaas kar rahe the
 The words were marked
 bhaashan kii copy vahiin mez par chhot gai
 i thought Rajan had read Hindi written in Roman, but the copy of his speech was in Devanagari
 aise padon par log hindi ke naam par chakma de jate hai
 Perhaps it is not Rajan's nature to dodge
 rajan ne kaha, "rajbhasha kaa kaam sajaavati sahitya yaa kala ko protsaahan dena nahin he
 Its main function is to improve the internal and external communication of that institution
 alan greenspan ke vipareet, reserve bank kaa governor paheliyon main baat nahin kar saktaa
 Rather, our job is to explain to the public why the economic structure needs to be improved to reduce inflation or to reduce npas in banks
 isiilie, ham viksit deshon ke kendriya bainkon kii tarah sirf kuch logon ko samaj main aane vaali takneekee bhashaa main baat nahin kar sakate
 The comments unhone kaha ki "arthshaastra vaise hi ek kathin vishay he
 The Department of Official Language has a difficult task that it not only has to convey the economics behind our policies to people, but it has to be done in such a simple language that you have to understand the double ph

 " kabhi khud par to kabhi halaat par hansate hue governor rajan kabhi kabhaar ladkadhaate bhi rahe, bahut mushkil se patibaddhta bol paae lekin kai vaakyon ko sahajata se kah gaye
 There is no information about Rajan's childhood but someone told that the very early years of his life have passed in Bhopal
 aakiri pairon par pahunch kar aise muskuraae jaise kah rahe hon ki dekha maine bhi hindi main bhaashan de diya
 If the South Indian speaks Hindi, there is extra reverence in the mind
 bhartiya reserve bank ke pehle rajbhasha adhikari pi jayraman dakshin bhartiya hi the
 Jayaraman, a scholar of Tamil Sanskrit and Hindi, has also received the Padma Shri
 bhartiya rigerv bank rajbhasha kii swarna jayanti manaa rahaa tha
 The eyes of six hundred hundred officers of the Reserve Bank and other banks from all over the country had come to see Rajan
 puraskaar mili to sirf unase or unke haathon se
 The winners were standing on the stage in such a way that Rajan kept coming in every frame
 rajan sahab ne anya up-governron ko aage kiya ki kuch puraskaar ve bhi den magar vijetaon ko acha nahin laga
 Those who returned happily from Rajan's hands and those who did not find them looked sad on the stage as if the suspension letter was being held
 ant main ek vijeta se rahaa nahin gaya
 Taking the prize from the Deputy Governor went to draw a picture with Rajan
 unke haath main apana maanaptr thama kar muskuraayaa or apane nayak ke saath fremauddh hokar laut aayaa
 i wish i could get it too! yah kaarykram 5 baje se shuru hona tha
 i arrived at 5:30
 sabhaagaar ke baahar swaagat adhikari ke alaava ikkaa-dukka log the
 As soon as he arrived, he felt that he had not come first
 swaagat adhikari mitra anil ne bataaya ki saare log bheetar hai
 The Governor arrived at exactly 5 o'clock and is sitting on the stage
 sunate hi khud se koft hui ki ye teen minute kii deree hui kyon
 i am also annoyed at the delay
 haul khachaakhach bharaa tha magar asar aisa ki laga har seat par rajan baithe hai
 It may also be that i too was looking at Rajan with the same curiosity as the others were watching
 unke jane ke baad prasiddh kavi ashok chakradhar ne to saaf kah diya ki main to us kursi se uthunga nahin jis par governor rajan baithe the
 i have not seen such attraction towards my head from peon to officer of any institute
 bhartiya reserve bank ke bheetar kuch to aisa gata he jisane rajan ko vaaqai rajan bana diya he
 The dignity of the Reserve Bank has always been there, but Rajan has had some effect, due to which the middle level officials were spontaneously cheating
 main kaanon se sunne laga ki log rajan ke bare main kya baat karte hai
 There was positivity in every voice
 baat-baat main jab maine kah diya ki charchaa to he ki aglaa governor koi or ho saktaa he to aasapaas ke logon kaa munh chota-sa ho gaya 
 "our sire is very good"
 daftar main baithkar kaam karte hai
 Their work makes the whole Reserve Bank work
 filein chalati rahati hai
 Most talk very well
 khud ko peeche rakhte hai
 We forward people
 pratibha to he hi, aadmi bahut achche hai
 The Governor keeps an eye on everything
 unki chintaa hoti he ki har kisi ko do vakt kii roti mili
 Do not cheat anyone
 ye chand awaajen hai, jo maine alag-alag logon se raghuram rajan ke bare main sunin
 i asked someone that Rajan knows Hindi
 mujhe bataaya gaya ek bahut hi junior adhikari ke saath samay nikaal kar hindi main charchaa karte hai
 That too on banking subjects
 ek patrkaar ko jab unhone rajkoshiya ghaataa kah diya to use laga ki galat to nahin sun liya
 Raghuram Rajan was practicing his speech while the other speakers were speaking
 shabdon par nishaan laga rahe the
 The copy of the speech was left on the table
 mujhe laga ki rajan ne roman main likhi hindi padhi he magar unke bhaashan kii copy devanagari main thi
 People in such positions dodge in the name of Hindi
 shaayad chakma dena rajan kii fitarat hi nahin he
 Rajan said, "the work of the official language is not to encourage decorative literature or art
 iskaa mukhya kaary he us sanstha ke aantarik or bahari sanchaar ko behatar bananaa
 Unlike Alan Greenspan, the Governor of the Reserve Bank cannot speak in riddles
 balki, hamaara kaam to janata ko yah samajhaana hota he ki kyon mudrasphiti ko kam karne ke liye yaa bainkon main enpie ghataane ke liye aarthik dhaanche main sudhaar kii jarurat he
 That is why, like the central banks of developed countries, we cannot speak in technical language understood by only a few people
 tippaniyan He said that "economics is likewise a difficult subject
 rajbhasha vibhaag ke paas yah kathin kaam he ki use na sirf hamaari nitiyon ke peeche kaa arthshaastra logon tak pahunchaana he, balki yah kaam aisi saral bhashaa main karnaa he ki aapako ise samajhane ke liye dabl piech
 No need to be a d - one in Economics and one in Hindi
 " At times, Governor Rajan kept laughing at the situation at times and sometimes faltering, he was able to speak very hard but he said many sentences with ease
 rajan ke bachapan ke bare main jaankaree nahin he magar kisi ne bataaya ki jivan ke behad aarambhik varsh bhopal main guzare hai
 On reaching his last legs, he smiled as if saying that i saw that i also gave a speech in Hindi
 dakshin bhartiya hindi bolta he to vaise hi man main atirikt shraddha umad aati he
