 The Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala has been swept in the Lok Sabha elections and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) has won 19 of the 20 seats in the state
 pinarai vijayan sarkaar ke liye ekmaatr raahat kii baat yahi rahi ki usne bhaajapa ko kerala main khaataa nahin kholane diya
 The CPI (M) lost all its strongholds in north and central Kerala and suffered a humiliating defeat in some seats
 use ekmaatr seat madhya kerala main alppuzha se mili
 As expected, the Sabarimala issue did not contribute much in reversing the party's fortunes as did the minority votes going to the Congress after Rahul Gandhi's decision to contest from the Wayanad seat
 yakeenan kerala main rahul kii lahar ne vam morche kaa safaya kar diya
 This huge defeat of the Left Front may have to be paid by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan
 vam morche kii pakad ganvaa dene kii gahari rajnatik chot unhen lagegi
 Being the doers of both the government and the party in the state, they bear all the responsibility
 chaar lokapriy marxvaadi netaaon ko chunaav maidan main utarkar vijayan ne ummid lagaai thi ki vam dalon ke paksh main alpsankhyak maton kii lamabandi hone se vah badi jeet hasil kar sakenge
 Politically, this poor performance will have serious implications for Marxists all over India
 rajya main keval ek seat jeet paane ke kaaran party pehali baar apni rashtriya party kii haisiyat ganvaa degi
 In the coming days, Vijayan's critics within and outside the party will also become quite vocal
 congress ke netritv main vipakshi dal vam morcha sarkaar ke khilaaf apane hamale tej kar denge
 anti-vijayan media will also ignite the fire
 mana ja rahaa he ki mukhyamantri party ke manch par kuch mahatvapurn faislon par punarvichaar karne ke liye majaboor ho jaaenge
 Some special advisors who mislead them may also be discharged
 lekin kya vijayan in sari baton ke liye taiyaar ho jaaenge? aisa maanane vaale bhi kam hi log hai
 a senior CPI (M) leader in the state told India Today that "vijayan is a leader who does not bow down
" ve aakhir tak ladaai ladenge
 "these results give the Congress a chance to stand again in the state
" pradesh congress ke tamaam netaa in nateezon se bahut khush honge
 As far as the BJP is concerned, even an attempt to polarize voters on the Sabarimala issue could not get him a seat in Kerala
 desh bhar main chali kesaria lahar se achoote rahe is aakhri garh main send lagane kii agali koshish karne ke liye ab use lanbaa intjaar karnaa padegaa

 anandiben ne 'aaj tak' se baatcheet main mukhyamantri pad ko lekar kaha ki faisla meri party karegi, koi ek vyakti tay nahin karegaa
 Anandiben said that in 2017, Patidar is no factor for the BJP
 patidaar mere saath hi hai
 Let us know what else Anandiben said
 
 
 aapaki sarkaar kedo salakaise dekhte hai?anandiben-kaamyaab rahe yaa naa rahe, ye moolyakan gujarat kii praja karegi
 i will not do this in evaluation because if any government works, it does it for the benefit of the subjects
 vivaad jo log khadaa karte hai, jo 15-20 saal se sarkaar main nahin he
 Whether or not such people will come back to the government, they raise controversy
 baaki janata ki taraf se koi vivaad khadaa ho gaya ho or rajya sarkaar ne maang puri nahin kii ho aisa nahin he
 That is why i would definitely say that no state has done as much work as the state government has done in the last 15 years
 isliye gujarat rajya ko model state ke taur par gina jaataa he
 In the last two years too many new plans were made
 congress kaa aarope he ki vaade kiye lekin puure nahin kiye?anandiben-congress bataae mujhe ki koun sa vaada puraa kiya or koun sa vaada puraa nahin kiya
 Congress President Bharat Singh Solanki says that the scheme or education institute of Narmada Band has been under the rule of Congress? The entire work was done, the land which was edited for the Narmada canal is the entire work done by the BJP government
 bharat singh ko pataa nahin he kyonki wo sarkaar main nahin hai
 In your time, Narendra Bhai had to sit on a fast for 72 hours to increase from 95 miter
 ye bhul gaye kya, jab hit bijepi sarkaar ne puri kar di lab get lagane ke liye ham 2008 se mahenat kar rahe the, lekin tab bhi manjuuri nahin mili
 If approved, we would have completed the work of the gate in 2012 and the water scarcity that is felt in the entire state today
 un logon ne kaam nahin kiya narendra bhai pradhanmantri bane or unhone 17 din main fil par sain kar die
 Your government accuses that you do such a scheme in which there is corruption? Anandiben - tell me about your corruption first, where corruption happened
 baat karnaa or bhrashtachar sabit karnaa alag baat he
 Giving evidence of that is different
 gujarat ko ek model state ke tor par dekha jaataa he, lekin vidhansabha main jo aankaden rakhe jate hai
 
 
 Anandiben- supposedly these are the statistics of our government, i tell you that we had a meditation camp a year ago
 unicef vaale aakanden dikhaa rahe the, maine poocha ki ye aankaden koun se saal ke hai to wo 2003-04 ke the
 The contemplation camp was in 2015, the latest figures should come
 aakanden 10 saal ke baad hi aate hai
 Today, the situation in Gujarat is different
 do saal aapaki sarkaar ko hue bijepi aalaa kaman ko ek report pesh kii gai jisamen gujarat main aapke kaam se khush nahin he?anandiben-aapane report dekhi? aapke paas report he to mujhe bataaen
 Neither my party has a report, people will be discussing that the report has been given and a question arises in front of you
 main dilli jaati hum to tunrat media shuru ho jaataa he ki is kii vajah se bulaayaa he
 Actually go for humming
 na hi hamen aise kaarykram ke liye bulaayaa jaataa
 What is it that people do such things for you? Anandiben - You raise the question and you answer the question
 main bhi skeresity kii meeting ke liye dilli gai thi
 The Prime Minister had called
 nitin bhai vahaan neet ke liye gaye the
 Regarding Nitinbhai's neet, on the other hand, the Prime Minister had called a meeting of Scarsity
 nitin bhai pradhanmantri se mili the?anandiben-nitin bhai pradhanmantri se nahin mili the
 Question What was the conversation with the Prime Minister in the meeting? i talked about anandiben-scarsity
 phir baar-baar ye baat kyon aati he ki aap haryana yaa punjab ki governor ban rahi hai?anandiben-ye main nahin uthaati hum
 Neither my activists pick up and it comes to the media that Anandiban has been called for this
 ham maan len ki aap bataur mukhyamantri gujarat main hi rahengi?anandiben-main kahin nahin jaaoongi
 i am going to live in Gujarat only
 jis tarah se vivaad hua he?anandiben-vivaad ko vivaad main rahane do
 Dispute is a dispute
 afvaa afvaa hi hoti he
 There is no truth in it
 ye afvaa hi he
 Then who spreads the rumor? Anandiben - i don't know
 aapke saath beti ko sarkari jameen dene kaa vivaad jo judaa tha?anandiben-phir vahi prashn maaf karo aap log
 The one who has nothing has told everything, yet you are asking the same question
 mujhe dukh hota he
 Congress is alleging that your government is running your son and daughter? Anandiben - My son and daughter have not even seen my office
 bijepi main aapke virodh main bahut baaten hoti hai kabhi aapane narendra bhai se is maamle main baatcheet kii he?anandiben-ye meraa maamla he
 Why should i tell you? main jo bhi baatcheet karti hum main kyon bataaun rajya sarkaar ki policy kii baat karte hai
 Why should i tell you about the organization
 aap jis patidaar samudaay se aati hai usne aarakshan kii maang ko lekar aapke khilaaf pichley dino baghawat kar di?anandiben-wo baghawat nahin thi, use baghawat nahin kahana chahie
 That was a demand
 samaaj main jitne log hai wo chaahe teacher hon, kisaan yaa doctor hon unhone sarkaar ke saamne maang rakhi
 a 21 year old boy, Hardik Patel made you think on reservation? Anandiben - What is the situation today, the Patidar society also understood that we have done wrong
 hardik jail ke andar rah kar aapako nuksaan pahunchaa rahaa hai, agar baahar rahata to kam nuksaan pahunchaata?anandiben-koi nuksaan nahi pahunchaa rahaa he
 We won the seat of eighty-four
 talala kii seat bhi 14 saal ke baad ham jeet gaye
 Patel was also there
 27 nagarpalika ham jite
 In which there was Patel community, in 2017 this will not have an effect, these are sensible people
 party ko bhi samajhate hai or sarkaar kaa kaam bhi samajhate hai
 So we will not have any harm in this coming time
 matlab 2017 main patidaar factor nahin hoga?anandiben-ye upachunaav main nahin hua to 2017 main kahaan hoga
 Who is the Political Threat for you? Anandiben - My job is only to work for the subjects of Gujarat
 main wo kaam chupchaap karti hum koi netaa ho yaa koi bhi unka kaam he praja ki seva karnaa wo main karti rahati hum
 i do not believe that the Congress is in front of me, or the society is thin
 2017 main kya aapako mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar maan sakate he?anandiben-main is kaa jawaab nahin duungi, kyonki is kaa jawaab meri party yaa meraa sanghathan hi de saktaa he
 Those who are over the age of 70 are placed in the Board of Guides? Anandiben - well, that is kept in the Board of Guides
 to kya aap maardarshak mandal main jaaegi?anandiben-aisi meri koi quality nahin he ki maardarshak mandal main mujhe rakhen
 Who will be the contender for the post of Chief Minister in 2017? Anandiben - don't worry about it, the time will come
 anandiben- narendra modi ne baari bahumat ke saath ab tak ke gujarat main chunaav jite the
 Will you win in 2017? Will the anandiben-absolutely Patidar Fact affect? the anandiben-patidar Factor will have no impact, she will be with us
 2017 main aapako bataur mukhyamantri dekhenge, kisi rajya ke governor ke taur par dekhenge, yaa sanghathan main dekhenge?anandiben-main phir se vahi jawaab duungi jo taiy karnaa he wo party ko taiy karnaa he
 The responsibility that has been entrusted to me will be done in the responsibility
 maine kabhi maang nahin ki he ki mujhe shikshaamantri banaao, sanghathan main rakho
 What will be the strategy in the 2017 election? Anandiben - Our strategy is not to tell anyone
 hamaara kaam chalata rahata he
 Even today, we see many of our programs going on
 aisa nahin he ki chunaav aayaa sanghathan kaa kaam karo, sarkaar kaa kaam karo
 This is not what we do, our work hamaara kaam chunaav ho yaa na ho, kaam chalata hi rahata he
 Is it not for you and Amit Shah? Anandiben - He does not come to Gujarat again and again
 jab bhi wo aate hai ham milte he
 Let's have a meeting
 baatcheet hoti he
 We do what they tell us

 In such a situation, this struggle of the government and the royal family has been the subject of discussion throughout Rajasthan

 For the support of the former royal family of Ishtahar, Jaipur is going to its former subjects for commercial purposes and it has been published everywhere

 Bihar's Art and Culture Minister Vinay Bihari has surprised everyone by making an absurd statement
 patna main samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki rape kii badhati ghatnaon ke peeche internet kii suvidha vaale mahange mobile phone hai
 Not only this, he has also given the reason for non-vegetarian diet
 mantri ne kaha ki mahange mobile phone ke kaaran ladke-ladkiyaan barbaad ho rahe hai
 Answering a question to reporters on a report to this effect in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, Bihari said, "mobile phones should be banned in schools and colleges
 mobile par internet hone ke kaaran bachche iskaa durupyog karte hai
 Due to this, the incidence of crime including rape increases
 'mantri ke mutabik mahange mobile rakhane vaale ladke-ladkiyaan internet ke jariye usamen porn downalod kar gaanv-gaanv tak dekh rahe hai
 This is causing distortions in the society, especially in incidents of rape
 vinay bihari ke mutabik aise prachlan par roak lagani chahie, varna samaaj tahas-nahas ho jayega
 Non-vegetarians also increased unethical behavior Bihari expressed displeasure with the mobile phone as well as the catering culture, especially the non-vegetarian
 unhone kaha ki isse samaaj main aniatikta bad rahi he
 Earlier the consumption of non-vegetarian was less, while today 90 percent people are non-vegetarian

 Chidambaram has said that upa's defeat in Lok Sabha elections was due to inflation
 unhone kaha ki mahangaai se pareshaan janata ne upie sarkaar ko chunaav main sabak sikhaaya
 Chidambaram said that the fiscal stimulus package given between 2009 and 2011 was a collective decision of the government, leading to a much higher fiscal and revenue deficit
 is vajah se mahangaai bad gai, jisase samprag sarkaar ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 In a speech on the analysis of the first full budget of the Modi government presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Chidambaram said that the 2015-16 General Budget did not meet the test of equality, fiscal and financial stability

 Chidambaram said that he had mentioned the stimulus package in a nutshell, due to which the central government's fiscal, revenue and current account deficit targets went awry and resulted in high inflation and people punished the government in elections 
 liba main apane bhaashan main chidambaram ne jetali dwaara rajkoshiya ghate ko jidipi ke teen pratishat karne ke lakshya ko hasil karne kii samay seemaa ek saal badhaakar 2017-18 karne kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Jaitley made fiscal deficit 3 in 2015-16

 There was a plan to keep 6 percent
 chidambaram ne kaha ki rajkoshiya ghate ko tay yojana se kuch ooncha rakhkar endie sarkaar ne 42,500 karod rupee atirikt udhaar lene kii yojana banaai he
 The government will spend this amount as non-plan expenditure, not plan expenditure
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main chidambaram ne kaha ki vyaktigat iskar kii daron main chauthaa slab banane kii jarurat he
 He reminded that he introduced three slabs of tax in the budget presented in 1997, but given the huge increase in income of some people after liberalization, he felt that the fourth slab was necessary to be kept
 purv vittamantri ne kaha ki sarkaar dwaara 14wein vitt ayog kii report sweekaar kiye jane se kendriya karon main rajyon kaa hissaa 32 pratishat se badhkar 42 pratishat ho gaya he, lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki rajyon ko adhik dhan milane ja rahaa he

 This year Chikungunya has more outbreaks than dengue
 lekin phir bhi dengue ke marij mil rahe hai
 Lack of platelets in dengue can prove fatal
 aise main dilli ke bade aspataalon main khun kii kalabazari karne vaale dalal jamkar chaandi kuta rahe hai
 The more the fear of fever, the sooner the fever and timidity are caught in the grip of these blood merchants
 inhen ko benakaab karne ke liye 'ajtak / india today' kii special investegative team ne dilli ke chaar bade aspataalon- lokanayak jaiprakash aspataal (alengepi), ol india institute of medical sycenge aspataal(ames), guru teg bahadur aspataal (jitibi) or ram manohar lohia aspataal (aaramail) kaa rukh kiya
 LNJP Hospital LNJP Hospital was flooded with patients and black-blooded brokers were seen doing their job indiscriminately
 yahaan ek thili khun kii keemat 3,500 rupye tak kii maang karte dekha gaya
 Rs 12,000 per unit is being sought for providing platelets to dengue patients
 'ajtak' ke camere ne alengepi aspataal ke ek karmchaaree ko kaid kiya
 It was found near the emergency ward
 under cover reporter ne is karmchaaree se kaha ki marij ek privet aspataal main bhartee he or use tatkaal khun kii zarurat he
 On hearing this, the employee called one of his fellow brokers
 dalal ne kaha ki alengepi aspataal ke blad bank se khun laakar de diya jayega lekin phir kisi bhi surat main uski vaapasi nahin hogi
 Upon assuring the under-cover reporter that he would not return the blood, the hospital staff and the broker confessed to speak further
 reporter ke poochne par ki paise kitne lagenge to dalal ne kaha ki doctor se puch kar bataata hum
 After talking to some people over the phone, the broker demanded up to Rs 3,500 for a unit Khoon
 reporter ke ye poochne par ki khun hoga to sahi, dalal ne jawaab diya, 'thik hoga, tension mat lo
 'also the hospital staff said-' Don't think that you will be caught upside down like this, working here, okay, those who give will give, those who give will give
 'aspataalon se khun lene kaa niyam hota he ki timaardaaron ko uski evaj main khun donnet karnaa hota he
 When the under cover reporter said that there would be no mess to donate blood, the broker's answer was- 'no, you will not have to donate, we will give you eight bottles, but how to take them from here will be your responsibility
 'under cover reporter ne khun ke saudagari kii pahunch kahaan tak he, ye jaanane ke liye poocha ki kya dengue ke marij ko chadhaane ke liye platelets bhi mil jaaenge, to dalal ne uske liye bhi hami bhar di
 The broker said, platelets will be found but it will take time
 dalal ne phir poocha- 'marij kablad grupakya he?' reporter ke o positive bataane par dalal ne kaha, 'agar o positive ke platelets hi marij ko chadhaae to use jaldi phayda hoga
 'aaj Tak / India Today' also came to know how the black marketers of blood work with vicious style
 baat platelets kii thi, kaam jokhim bharaa tha
 It was difficult to get inside the hospital, so the broker introduced another member of his network to the under cover reporter
 usne bharosa bhi dilaayaa ki aspataal main khun nahin milegaa to kahin or se laakar uplabdh karaayaa jayega
 These brokers claimed that they have been engaged in this work for 12 years and if the platelets of a particular blood group are not found here, they will provide the blood donor of that group
 jaahir ye donor swechha se khun daan karne vaale to honge nahin balki apana khun bechney vaale log hi honge
 The brokers demanded Rs 28,000 for 8 units of blood and Rs 36,000 for three units of blood platelets
 jaahir he ki dengue jaisi beemaari kaa jitna khauf failata he utana hi khun ke in saudagaron kaa dhandha chamakta he
 After AMSLNJP Hospital, 'aaj Tak / India Today' shifted to AIIMS, the largest hospital in the country
 ye jaanane ke liye ki khun ke kalabazriyon kii jaden kahaan tak faili hui hai
 There is more strictness in AIIMS, so blood is available from the blood bank here only when the first blood of the patient donates blood
 is sakhti ke baavjood yahaan bhi khun ke saudagar bekhauf sakriy dikhaai die
 Here, under cover reporter from Mahesh Punjabi broker asked to collect 5 units of blood from anywhere, stating the condition of the patient is critical
 is par dalal ne kaha ki 5 ho 10 ho yaa 15 unit, jitna marji chaaho khun mil jayega
 When the broker was asked where he would gather the donor, he said that the boys from the college would get the money to pay for blood
 reporter ne poocha ki kitna paisa lagegaa to dalal ne kaha ki teen hajaar rupee unit lete hai lekin aap se 2800 rupee le lenge
 When asked by this broker to provide plates for the patients of o positive group, he demanded Rs 6000 for this
 jab dalal ko emergency kaa hawala diya gaya to usne kaha ki ames main bheed zyada he, yahaan ladakon ko bulaane ke baad blad checking, or khun daan karaane se lekar platelets nikaalane tak main liye ek din se zyada vakt lag jayega
 When the under cover reporter said that there is not much time, the broker (mahesh Punjabi) called another broker
 is duusare dalal ne kaha ki kaam ho jayega, do ghante kaa vakt dena hoga, lekin paise zyada lagenge
 When the under cover reporter talked about reducing the money, the broker started explaining the importance of white blood sales in blood
 bataane laga ki platelets se hi khun banataa he
 When the broker wanted to know that it would be safe to take blood in this way, blood of a drug addict would not be given
 is par dalal ne kaha ki nahin college ke ladakon se khun liya jaataa he
 These brokers also told that they take blood from college students whose expenses are high and they take this path to fulfill them
 dallalon ke daawey ke mutabik khun kii blike marketing main dilli hi nahin, noida, greater noida or gajiabad ke ladke bhi hissaa bane hue hai
 After this, the brokers started talking about Bonnie
 kaha ki abhi ek hajaar rupye de do baaki kaam hone ke baad
 After all, the broker agreed to take 200 rupees as Bonnie
 khun ke saudagahospatalon main dallalonpar padane vaali red se bhi bekhauf hai

 High court on Thursday pulled up the Delhi Police and asked if it has closed any illegal massage parlor in the national capital
 a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice c Harishankar told the Delhi Police, "do something
" kuch kaam kariye
 Then file a status report
 anyathaa koun aapaki report ko padhanaa chahega
 The bench said this while hearing a PIL which alleged that sex rackets were being run indiscriminately under the garb of a massage parlor
 peeth ne yah tippanee police dwaara daakhil haalia report par nakhushi jataate hue kii, jisamen is baat kaa sanket nahin diya gaya tha ki kya usne shahar main chalane vaale kisi bhi avaidh massage parlor ko band kiya he
 The court said, "you should have told that till now you have closed about three dozen such massage parlors and the water and electricity connection of such establishments has been cut
" yahaan darjanon massage parlor hone chaiye
 Can you give an example that you have closed a massage parlor? Where are your officers? ”the bench said that it could not set up committees to do police work and warned that if it had to set up a committee, it could make strong comments against the agency
 peeth ne police ko sunwaayee kii agali taarikh 25 november tak ek report daakhil karne ko kaha jisamen is tarah ke parlor ke khilaaf kii gai karrwai ke bare main jaankaree dene ko kaha gaya he

 The House accepted the proposal to approve the recommendation of the Committee on the Mann case
 aap sadsy ke anuchit aacharan kii jaanch karne vaali bhaajapa sadsy kirit somaiya kii adhyakshata vaali samiti ne kal loksabhaa main pesh apni report main kaha he ki sansad sadsy bhagwant maan kaa aacharan atyadhik aapattijanak he jo darshata he ki vah aadharbhoot gyaan, shishtachar tathaa jo pad vah dhaaran kiye hue hai, uske uttardayitvon ke prati anbhigya hai
 The report said, "bhagwant Mann has jeopardized the security of Parliament House and the people associated with it by his misconduct
 iske alaava maan ne samiti ko die gaye apane uttar main susangat or santulit drushtikon nahin apanaaya
 He corrected himself after several opportunities given to clarify the contradictions inherent in his answers, and on 28 November told the committee that he was partially withdrawing his earlier letters and apologizing unconditionally for it Huh
 ’’ samiti ne kaha ki chah disambar 2016 ko apane i-mail sandesh main bhagwant maan ne pun: usee para ko doharaaya ki ‘‘main is baat se saaf inkaar karata hum ki meri ore se sansad kii suraksha vyavastha main koi bhul chook hui he

 According to the report, the committee feels that the same contradiction appears again and again in Mann's letter and hence apologizing to the committee in this way cannot be called an unconditional apology

 The committee emphasizes Bhagwant Mann's strict adherence to the norms and standards of Parliament's etiquette, proper adherence to the Rules of Procedure and well-established traditions of Parliament and maintaining etiquette and decorum

 a committee headed by BJP member Kirit Somaiya, probing the improper conduct of AAP member, in its report tabled in Lok Sabha yesterday, said that the conduct of Member of Parliament Bhagwant Mann is highly objectionable which shows that basic knowledge, etiquette and the position he holds Are clueless, ignorant of his responsibilities
 report main kaha gaya he, ‘‘apane galat aacharan se bhagwant maan ne sansad bhawan or usase jude logon kii suraksha ko khatre main daalaa he
 Further, Mann did not adopt a coherent and balanced view in his reply to the committee
 unke uttaron main antarnihit virodhabhaason ko spasht karne ke liye die gaye anek avasaron ke pashchaat hi unhone swayan main sudhaar kiya or 28 november ko samiti ko bataaya ki vah apane purvavarti patron ko aanshik rup se waapas le rahe hai or iske liye bina shart maafee maang rahe hai
 The committee said that in its e-mail message on December 6, 2016, Bhagwant Mann again repeated the same paragraph, saying, "I categorically deny that there has been any mistake on my part in the security system of Parliament
" 
 ’’ The report said that Mann also denied that he had videographed the Parliament House property and its installations and any security arrangements in the Parliament House complex or as it is alleged to have uploaded some important footage
 report ke mutabik samiti mahasoos karti he ki maan ke patr main baar-baar vahi virodhabhas dikhaai detaa he or isliye is tarah se samiti se maafee maangane ko bina shart maafee maangana nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 The report of the Committee on Investigation of the Unfair Conduct of the Member states that, "after due discussion, the committee recommends that Member of Parliament Bhagwant Mann be suspended for the tenth term of the 16th Lok Sabha i
e
 the remaining term of the current session
" ’’ samiti bhagwant maan dwaara sansad ke shishtachar ke mandandon or maanakon kaa kadai se anupaalan karne, prakriya niyamon or sansad kii susthaapit paramparaon ke uchit anupaalan or shishtachar evam maryaada ko banaae rakhane par jor detii he
 The comments samiti yah drudh ichha vyakt karti he ki maan bhavishya main aisa galat vyavhaar nahin karenge
 According to the report, the committee also notes that there are some serious issues facing parliamentary security that need to be resolved on a priority basis

 ) The report said, "bhagwant Mann has jeopardized the security of Parliament House and the people associated with it by his misconduct
 iske alaava maan ne samiti ko die gaye apane uttar main susangat or santulit drushtikon nahin apanaaya
 He corrected himself after several opportunities given to clarify the contradictions inherent in his answers, and on 28 November told the committee that he was partially withdrawing his earlier letters and apologizing unconditionally for it Huh
 ’’ samiti ne kaha ki chah disambar 2016 ko apane i-mail sandesh main bhagwant maan ne pun: usee para ko doharaaya ki ‘‘main is baat se saaf inkaar karata hum ki meri ore se sansad kii suraksha vyavastha main koi bhul chook hui he
 '' report main kaha gaya he ki maan ne is baat se bhi inkaar kiya ki unhone sansad bhawan sampada or isaki sansthapanaaon or sansad bhawan parisar kii kisi suraksha vyavastha kii videography kii he athwa jaisaa ki aarope he ki kisi tarah ke mahatvapurn footage aplod kiye hai
 According to the report, the committee feels that the same contradiction appears again and again in Mann's letter and hence apologizing to the committee in this way cannot be called an unconditional apology

 The committee emphasizes Bhagwant Mann's strict adherence to the norms and standards of Parliament's etiquette, proper adherence to the Rules of Procedure and well-established traditions of Parliament and maintaining etiquette and decorum

 com / pwftsj4020 Ishq and Husn have been a part of human life for centuries
 lekin isi ishk or husn ke chalate namaaloom kitni jindagiyaan tabah hui hai
 Let's talk about that Hasina, whom any sweetheart will die on her
 is baat kaa ilm is hasina ko bhi tha or uske saath rahanevaale do doston ko bhi
 And then once this trio did what they did, it was beyond anyone's thinking
 teenon ne buni ek gahari sajeesh
 a conspiracy in which the victim got trapped in the trap of beauty so much that he got trapped there because it was the trap of beauty
 aashiqui kii chaal
 Closed room and blackmail! This story will surprise you because this story is of that beautiful trap, which once trapped, just understand that it was ruined
 mumkin he aapke ird-gird bhi koi aisa ho, jo ye jaal bun rahaa ho
 So watch and save
 is jaal main jo fansaa, wo kaam se bhi gaya or naam se bhi
 Because this is the trap that has not yet become the web of many people
 hairaani kii baat to ye he ki is jaal main funsane vaale shaks ko is baat kii jaraa bhi bhanak nahin lagati kii wo husn or fareb ke ek aise jaal main ulajhane vaala he ki jisase wo jitna baahar nikalne kii koshish karegaa wo usamen utana hi ulajhata jayega
 Only three people who weave nets, the whole net is woven in a closed room
 jaal bunane vaale sirf teen log hai
 And these three have the entire end of the trap in their hands
 ye teenon is vakt is kamare main khaas mishan ke liye ikattha hue hai
 The mission is to trap a victim in Operation Trap and wait for them, then just hunted one dead
 kamare main kuch khaas taiyaari ke baad teenon apane sajeesh ko anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye bekaraar hone lagate hai
 The work inside the room was completed
 ab masalaa kamare ke baahar kaa he
 So the three get out of the hotel and then the search begins for the one who is to be trapped in their trap
 thode se intjaar ke baad ye talash bhi puri ho jaati he
 Monica had reached the one who was now about to be hunted
 ab phir se vahi jagah, vahi hotel or vahi cameraa
 
 
 But this time both of Monica's lovers are missing from the room and scene
 kamare main pahunchate hi manika tamaam khidki-darvaaze band kar detii he
 As soon as the room is closed, Monica immediately becomes her color
 ab kamare main sirf do log hai
 But right now, even though two people are coming in this room, it is not so
 is kamare main is vakt kai ankhen hai jo lagaataar donon ko ghur rahi hai
 Who are constantly capturing the antics of both in their eyes
 jaahir he is khel ko ab aap thodaa-thodaa samaj rahe honge
 You must have realized that what trap is being woven in a closed room? a beautiful girl
 kamare main camere kaa khel
 
 
 And a victim has been trapped in his web and he has no idea that the game of blackmailing will start with him as soon as he steps outside this room
 jisase wo chaah kar bhi baahar nahin nikal paaegaa
 The fact of blackmailing by creating a social site on the internet, Monika started with two of her friends friends, Chivendu and Williams, and created a social site on the Internet called Tagged
com
 is website par monica ne kai khubasurat tasviren daal rakhi thi or apane shikaar ko aakarshith karti thi
 a chartered accountant Arun from Ludhiana became a victim of a beautiful deception that trapped the man of Ludhiana
 arun ko in teenon ne apane jaal main fansaakar dilli bulaayaa
 And Monika reached Janakpuri to receive Shuddh Arun by car
 or phir siaar park main apane ghar par le ai
 There Monika tried to get close to Arun and in the meantime, his two colleagues who were already hiding in the room started taking pictures of both of them
 iske baad unhone arun ko blackmel karnaa shuru kar diya or jab baat nahin bani to arun ko bandhak banaakar uske gharavaalon se chaar lakh kii phiroti kii maang kar daali
 After making pornographic videos, the ransom website had the tagline of ransom to meet new people
 is site par apni khubasurat tasviren daalkar ye logon se dosti karti or phir shuru hoti unka ek behad khusurat or kufnak khel
 After making friends, Monica would call her victim to meet him
 husn ke jaal main funskar uskaa shikaar khud hi uske jaal main funs jaataa
 Monica would first kidnap her victim and then make pornographic videos of them
 or phir shuru hota phiroti kaa khel
 Two of his foreign friends used to support him in this trap of beauty
 chivendu or wiliam
 Monika from Faridabad came to Delhi angry from home and here she met Chivondu studying IT on social site and both of them started living together in Jaipur
 baad main inaki mulaakaat nigaaria ke rahane vaale williams se hui or phir in teenon ne soshal site ke jariye logon ko blackmel kar paise anthone kii yojana banaai
 This time, Monika and her gangrun are trapped in the clutches of Monica and her friends
 or monica ne plan ke mutabik uske gharavaalon ko phiroti ke liye phone bhi kar diya tha
 But he made a mistake
 ek aisi galati jisaki vajah se police us tak pahunch gai
 Arun's family members in Ludhiana also paid a ransom amount of 4 lakhs to Monika's account
 lekin is dauraan dilli police lagaataar monica ke phone ko trep kar rahi thi or police ne siaar park ke ek makaan se monica or uske do saathiyo ko giraftaar kar liya
 The police also rescued CA Arun Wahi
 police teenon kii giraftaar ke baad monica ke khaaton kii talash kar rahi he
 Police suspect that Monika's associates have also made obscene videos of Monica with Arun
 The police is also investigating these in depth mobile
 fasebuk ke itihaas kaa sabase badadeta brichaho chukaa he
 Hackers have affected about 50 million facebook accounts
 company ke mukabik havers ne soshal network ke code ke saath ched chhaad kii he
 According to Facebook, a patch has been released to fix the loopholes by which hackers have done so
 yugers kaa sawaal ye he ki jo acounts prabhavit hue hai, kya unka galat yuj kiya ja rahaa he? haalanki fasebuk ne ye saaf kiya he ki password or pement system isekkingse prabhavit nahin hai
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement, 'our initial investigation so far has not shown that hackers have accessed someone's private message or post while using tokens'
 Token? Significantly, hackers have affected Facebook accounts through access tokens
 acces token ke jariye yugers fasebuk par lagaataar lambey samay tak online rah sakate hai or iske liye unhen dubaara password bhi nahin daalana hota he
 Facebook has said that the company has reset 50 million tokens and tokens of another 40 million users have also been investigated
 fasebuk kii jaanch chal rahi he or abhi or bhi terning points aa sakate hai
 Is your account affected by hacking? Users who have been affected by this hacking have logged out themselves
 agar aapke saath bhi aisa hua he to aap apane password se ise phir sa log in karen
 At the top of the news feed, Facebook will give the banner of an important security update
 yahaan aapako data brich ke bare main jaankaree milegi
 If you are not out of the 90 million, Facebook still asks you to log out the account as a precession
 aisa karne se saare tokens riset ho jaaenge
 You can do this not only from mobile but also from desktop
 password change kar len
 However Facebook says that hackers have hacked access tokens are password safe
 lekin sibar security exparts kaa maananaa he ki aapako password change karnaa chahie
 Turn on two factor authentication
 ap log in check karen or gaiyr jaruri eps ko hataa lenfasebuk prabhavit eps ko khud se hataa rahaa he, lekin aap khud se ye jaanch kar len ki jin eps ko aapane fasebuk se log in kiya he yani unhen apane fasebuk kaa acces diya he kya aap un par bharosa kar sakate hai? agar nahin to un eps ko in ap log in se hataa len
 Because those apps use such tokens that can be logged into Facebook for a long time without entering a password
 arthshaastra se taalluk nahin rakhane vaale log aksar is vishay ko nirashapurna vigyaan bataate hai
 The reason for this is to focus on economics on topics that seem difficult to solve
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri manmohan singh isse ittefaq nahin rakhte
 "I think this is misleading analysis," said Manmohan Singh at the 92nd annual conference of the Indian Economic Association
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘arthshaastra nirashapurna vigyaan lagata he ki arthshaastri praaia: aise vishay ko uthaate hai jinka hal mushkil lagata he
 Often such problems are related to the situation of those who are not able to make enough progress or whose progress may be hindered in future
 ’’pradhanmantri ne jansankhya ke bare main arthshaastri thomas malths ke vichaaron kaa zikr kiya jise sambhavat: sarvaadhik nirashapurna akalan mana jaataa he
 He said that the prediction about the impact on climate change in the future would come under the category of extremely disappointing
 unhone kaha, ‘‘iske baavjood is prakaar kaa vishleshan behad anivaary kaary he
 These things attract attention to basic problems
 in samasyaon kaa agar samay rahete samaadhaan nahin kiya gaya to vah gambhir sthiti main pahunch jaaegi jisase nipatna kathin hoga
 Manmohan Singh said that our critics should remember that we economists focus on problems
 iskaa makasad in samasyaon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan akshirt karnaa or uskaa sambhavit hal nikaalnaa hota he
 We believe that attracting attention to the problem will solve it

 ) On Friday night, more than half past and news was received that Zindagi had finally said goodbye to musician Adesh Srivastava, who had been struggling with death for several days
 kitna ajeeb he ki 4 sitambar ko aadesh kaa janmdin tha or isi din vah chal based
 As soon as the news was received, the face of the order 35 years ago was revealed, which was seen in the show of the Polidor Orchestra of Jabalpur
 sangeet sadhana kii aseem urja se bhare aadesh shrivastav ne 80 ke dashak main manch par apane hunar se shrotaaon ko rubaru karana shuru kar diya tha
 He played jazz and other rhythmic instruments
 darshak unako sangeet kii tarang main lay ke saath taal main duba hua pate the
 His brother Chitresh Srivastava was also a part of this band
 80 or 90 ke dashak main aadesh polidor ke alaava jabalpur shahar ke ek anya band vishaal orcestra main bhi apni pratibha kaa loha manavaate rahe
 Over time, this instrumental Vrind (orchestra) of Jabalpur stopped and Aadesh Srivastava also turned to Bollywood from this city of Madhya Pradesh
 lambey arase ke baad nau saal pehle 2006 main aadesh shrivastav se jabalpur main hi mulaakaat hui
 He came to the annual conference of his school Government Model School in his city
 maine unke saath jab jabalpur or orcestra ke dinon kii yaaden taaja kin to unhone kaha ki yadi tab mumbai na jaataa to kabhi na ja paata
 Let me tell you that Adesh Srivastava was from a middle class family and his father was serving in the railways
 tippaniyan In almost all such families, it is expected from the child that soon after studying and writing, he should become self-sufficient on some job
 aadesh isse juda aisi raah par the jisase vah aatmasantosh to paa sakate the lekin orcestra se guzaara chalaanaa naammumkin tha
 Even today, there are only bands amateur operated in small cities
 aadesh ne bataaya tha ki rasta to koi bhi nahin tha
 What would he have done if he had not left Jabalpur? For the first several days, there was a lot of anxiety about the future in music and then decided that now there is no option but to go to Mumbai and fight
 mumbai pahunchaa, vahaan lambey samay tak kaam kii talash main bhatka
 Small opportunities continued and then in 1994 finally the opportunity came as a music director in the film 'aao Pyaar Karen'
 aadesh shrivastav ne janimani gayika, abhinetri sulakshana pandit or sangeet nirdeshak jatin-lalit kii bahan vijeyata pandit se shaadi kii
 In 1980, Vijeta entered the film world as an actress from the film 'love Story'
 iske baad vah kuch filmon main or ain
 After ‘aao Pyaar Kareen’, Aadesh Srivastava gave music in several consecutive films
 sau se adhik filmon main unhone sangeet diya jo ki kaaphi lokapriy hua
 Among them, the melodious music of many films like 'chalte Chalte', 'bagwan', 'babul', 'refugee', 'kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' and 'rajneeti' will be remembered by people for a long time
 aadesh shrivastav ne bollywood kii sangeet kii duniya main apni alag pahchaan banaai
 After the 90s, a significant change was seen in film music, in which the singer appears to be following the instrumental music
 lekin aadesh ne gayak ko hameshaa lead di
 The film has a melody in spite of being flamboyant as per the demand
 aadesh tum jabalpur se mumbai gaye
 
 
 You settled your vowel world there
 
 
 tumhen vahaan vah sab mila, jo tumne chaha
 
 
 But what this, now departed from the world itself
 abhi tumse bahut ummid thi
 
 
 Your music was still needed
 alavida aadesh shrivastav
 
 tum apane sangeet ke saath hameshaa jinda rahoge
 Apart from Adesh Polydor in the 80s and 90s, another band of Jabalpur city also kept their talent in the huge orchestra
 samay ke saath jabalpur ke yah vaadya vrund (orcestra) band hote gaye or aadesh shrivastav ne bhi madhyapradesh ke is shahar se bollywood kii ore rukh kar liya
 After a long time, Nine met Srivastava in 2006 in Jabalpur, nine years ago
 vah apane shahar main unke skool government model skool ke vaarshik sammelan main aae the
 When i brought back memories of the days of Jabalpur and Orchestra with him, he said that if he had not gone to Mumbai then he would never have gone
 aapako yah bataata chaluun ki aadesh shrivastav ek madhyamvargeey parivaar se the or unke pita railway main sevarat the
 The comments aise kareeb sabhi pariwaron main santan se yahi apeksha kii jaati he ki vah jald pard likhakar kisi naukari par lagakar aatmanirbhar ho jaae
 The order was on such a different way that he could get complacency but it was impossible to go through the orchestra
 aaj bhi chote shaharon main chhutput sanchalit kiye ja rahe band ameor hi hai
 The order said that there was no way out
 jabalpur na chodta to kya karata? pehle kai din tak sangeet main bhavishya ko lekar uhapoh main fansaa rahaa or phir tay kiya ki ab mumbai jaakar sangharsh karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 Reached Mumbai, wandered there in search of work for a long time
 chote-chote maukey milte rahe or phir 1994 main aakhirkaar film 'aao pyaar karen' main bataur sangeet nirdeshak avasar mil hi gaya
 Aadesh Srivastava married Vijeta Pandit, sister of noted singer, actress Sulakshana Pandit and music director jatin-lalit
 vijeyata ne san 1980 main film 'lav story' se bataur abhinetri filmi duniya main kadam rakhaa tha
 She then appeared in a few films
 'aao pyaar karen' ke baad aadesh shrivastav ne lagaataar kai filmon main sangeet diya
 He gave music in more than a hundred films which became quite popular
 inamen 'chalate-chalate', 'bagwan', 'babul', 'rifuji', 'kabhi khushi kabhi gam' or 'raajnneeti' jaisi kai filmon kaa samdhur sangeet logon ko lambey samay tak yaad rahegaa
 Aadesh Srivastava made his own identity in the Bollywood music world
 90 ke dashak ke baad film sangeet main ek khaas badlaav dikhaai dene laga jisamen gayak vaadya sangeet ke peeche jaataa dikhaai detaa he
 But the order always gave the singer a lead
 film kii maang ke mutabik tadak-bhadak hone ke baavjood unke sangeet main madhurata he
 Aadesh went from Jabalpur to Mumbai
 
 
 vahaan tumne apni swaron kii duniya basaai
 
 
 You got everything you wanted there
 
 
 lekin yah kya, ab duniya se hi vidaa ho gaye
 i had high hopes for you right now
 
 
 tumhaare sangeet kii abhi or jarurat thi
 Goodbye order Srivastava
 
 You will always be alive with your music
 aise kareeb sabhi pariwaron main santan se yahi apeksha kii jaati he ki vah jald pard likhakar kisi naukari par lagakar aatmanirbhar ho jaae

 But the order always gave the singer a lead
 film kii maang ke mutabik tadak-bhadak hone ke baavjood unke sangeet main madhurata he
 Aadesh went from Jabalpur to Mumbai
 
 
 vahaan tumne apni swaron kii duniya basaai
 
 
 You got everything you wanted there
 
 
 lekin yah kya, ab duniya se hi vidaa ho gaye
 i had high hopes for you right now
 
 
 tumhaare sangeet kii abhi or jarurat thi
 Goodbye order Srivastava
 
 You will always be alive with your music
 sau se adhik filmon main unhone sangeet diya jo ki kaaphi lokapriy hua
 Among them, the melodious music of many films like 'chalte Chalte', 'bagwan', 'babul', 'refugee', 'kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' and 'rajneeti' will be remembered by people for a long time
 aadesh shrivastav ne bollywood kii sangeet kii duniya main apni alag pahchaan banaai
 After the 90s, a significant change was seen in film music, in which the singer appears to be following the instrumental music
 lekin aadesh ne gayak ko hameshaa lead di
 The film has a melody in spite of being flamboyant as per the demand
 aadesh tum jabalpur se mumbai gaye
 
 
 You settled your vowel world there
 
 
 tumhen vahaan vah sab mila, jo tumne chaha
 
 
 But what this, now departed from the world itself
 abhi tumse bahut ummid thi
 
 
 Your music was still needed
 alavida aadesh shrivastav
 
 tum apane sangeet ke saath hameshaa jinda rahoge

 dilli main congress se gathbandhan kii kayaas ke bich aam aadmi party rahul gandhi par hamalavar ho gayi he
 AAP leader Gopal Rai has accused the Congress of strengthening the BJP and weakening the opposition
 aam aadmi party ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main rahul kii ranneeti par sawaal bhi khadey kiye
 Gopal Rai raised the issue of Rahul Gandhi contesting from Kerala during a press conference
 unhone kaha ki raajnneeti ke vartmaan parivesh main jab puraa desh piem narendra modi kii taanashaah sarkaar ke khilaaf ekajute hokar ladaai lard rahaa he, aise main congress party kii taraf se yah elaan karnaa, ki rahul gandhi kerala se bhi chunaav ladenge bada hi aashcharya chakit karne vaala he
 The Congress is dividing the votes, the AAP leader said that this is the discussion between all the opposition parties and the people of the country today, what is the reason why Rahul Gandhi instead of fighting against the dictatorship of PM Modi The main centers of opposition are targeting
 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress dwaara siton kaa bantbara na karne par sawaal uthaate hue AAP netaa gopal raay ne kaha ki uttar pradesh ke andar bhi congress puri koshish kar rahi he ki vahaan voton kaa bantwaaraa ho jaae, pashchim bengal ke andar bhi congress puri koshish kar rahi he ki vahaan bhi voton kaa bantwaaraa ho jaae, andhra pradesh ke andar bhi congress koshish kar rahi he ki vahaan voton kaa bantwaaraa ho jaae
 bjp's AAP leader Gopal Rai, a candidate from Wayanad, says that announcing to contest from Kerala, where the left wing has a strong support base, shows that Congress party and Rahul Gandhi's priority is BJP and PM Modi Instead of getting rid of dictatorship, BJP has to help somewhere
 AAP ke rahul gandhi se 3 sawaal1- agar rahul gandhi south se chunaav ladanaa chaahate hai, to kerala hi kyon karnataka yaa tamilnadu se kyon nahin?2- kya congress vartmaan kii modi sarkaar se kisi prakaar ke dabaav main he, aakhir wo kya majaburi he jiske chalate congress ko aise faisle lene pad rahe hai?3- rahul gandhi bataaen ki wo desh ko bachaane kii bajaae vipaksh ko kamazor karne main kyon lage hue hai?gopal raay ne aage kaha ki haal hi main haryana ke jind main hue up-chunaav ke nateezon se bhi yah saamne aayaa he, ki agar haryana main vipaksh ekajute ho jaae to haryana kii 10 siton par bhaajapa ko haraaya ja saktaa he
 The Congress leaders of Haryana also want the opposition to unite and contest elections in Haryana
 lekin rahul gandhi ne abhi tak us baat par koi vichaar nahin kiya he
 AAP besieges Congress on coalition Aam Aadmi Party targeted Rahul Gandhi for not deciding on alliance in Delhi
 gopal raay ne kaha ki pichley 3 maheene se congress ek ajeeb se asamanjas main ghiri hui he
 The people of entire Delhi want that the opposition in Delhi fight unitedly and rid Delhi and the country of PM Modi's dictatorship
 lekin congress party or rahul gandhi pichley 3 maheene main ek chota sa faisla nahin le paae ki gathbandhan karnaa he yaa nahin karnaa he
 Gopal Rai on the alliance Gopal Rai was seen answering roundly on the question of AAP not agreeing with the Congress on the alliance
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party ke congress se hajaar matbhed hai iske baavjood ham vipaksh ke saath khadey hai
 The matter of the proposal is outdated
 congress kaa faisla sirf bijepi ko majboot kar rahaa he
 After this, the question was asked whether the matter is being stuck with Congress on seat sharing? Gopal Rai replied that the Congress has not yet agreed to the alliance, the matter has not reached the seat
 aapako bataa den ki dilli main 12 may ko loksabhaa chunaav hone hai
 There has been confusion over the alliance between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party for the past several weeks on seven seats in Delhi
 haalanki saaton loksabhaa siton par aam aadmi party ne apane ummidavaar utarkar prachaar shuru kar diya he to vahiin congress abtak ummidavaar bhi tay nahin kar pai he

 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that despite endorsing the bill in the Lok Sabha, we can have a different view on the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main shivasena ke teen sadsy hai
 If the Shiv Sena votes against the Citizenship Amendment Bill, then the Modi government's number game in the Rajya Sabha could be spoiled
 philhal, modi sarkaar ke saport main 119 sadsy hai, jabaki vipaksh main 100 sadsy hai
 If you add Shiv Sena, this figure becomes 103
 19 rajyasabha sadasyon kaa rukh saaf nahin he
 What is in the Rajya Sabha? Let us know that the Citizenship Amendment Bill has easily passed in the Lok Sabha and now the Modi government will present it in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ke paksh main jediu, shivasena, bijedy or purvottar ke kuch dalon ke saath aane kii vajah se sarkaar ko is bill ko paas karaane main koi dikkat nahin hui
 The Lok Sabha got 311 votes in favor of this bill
 jabaki, vipaksh main 80 vot
 Now the path of the Modi government in the Rajya Sabha is considered easy
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak main bangladesh, pakistan or afghanistan ke hindu, jain, isai, sikh , buddha or parsi samudaay ko bhartiya naagarikta dene kaa prastaav he
 The Muslim community is excluded from this bill
 centre sarkaar ko inhen dalon ke virodh ke kaaran rajyasabha main naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak par charchaa karaane se peeche hatana padaa tha
 Many opposition parties, including the Congress, are quite aggressive about the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 lekin modi sarkaar ne jediu or bijedy ko apane saath kar sadan ke ankaganit ko apane paksh main kar liya

 wo raat ke andhere main aata he or sunsaan jagahon par akele hone vaale kisi bhi shaks kaa sir pattharon se kuchal andhere main hi gaayab ho jaataa he
 In this way, this person has killed three people in the last month and a half
 lekin har katl ke baad wo police ko chalange karnaa nahin bhuulataa
 Because after every murder, he calls from his victim's mobile and also informs his family of the murder
 aakhir koun he ye pathar vaala kaatil? or kya he is stone main kaa raaj?gujarat ke rajkot shahar main buudhvaar 20 april kii subah shahar ke railway ilaake main police ko ek laash milti he
 The corpse's head has been severely crushed by a heavy stone
 or paas hi khun se sanaa ek pathar bhi padaa he
 Which seems to have been crushed by the mortal's life
 lekin isse pehle ki police apni tafteesh aage badhaati, use ek chaunkaane vaali baat pataa chalati he
 That is that the murderer had made a call from his mobile at the home of the person who died
 or usne kaha tha 'maine isko tapakaa diya he
 Do whatever you can
 'paanch din baad phir hui ghatnaghatna ke thik paanch din baad yani mangalvaar, 25 april kii subah bhi thik aisi hi ek duusari vaardaat saamne aati he
 This time the corpse is found from Gandhigram area of the city
 lekin is baar bhi laash kaa sir kisi baari pathar se kuchlaa hua he
 Right now, the police are looking at this new incident with the murder that happened five days ago, that they get to know a strange thing that their senses fly away
 kyonki is baar bhi kaatil ne marane vaale ke mobile phone se uske gharavaalon ko phone kiya he
 And then said the same thing, 'I have dripped it
 jo kar sakate ho, kar lo!'ab police ko ye lagane lagata he ki ho naa ho in donon hivaardaaton ke peeche kisi ek hi shaks yaa gang kaa haathhai
 Which is not only taking the lives of people by crushing them with stones, but is also threatening and challenging them in the same way by calling the families of the deceased
 teesri laash milane se sansaneeb police apni tafteesh or tej kar detii he
 In any case, she wants to get to the bottom of the case as soon as possible
 lekin kai roj guzarane ke baad naa to katl kaa makasad pataa chalata he or naa hi kaatil kaa
 On the other hand, both the sentences start blurring from the memory of the people
 lekin thik 38 roj baad
 On Thursday, June 2, another such incident comes to the fore, which causes the land to fall under the feet of the policemen as well as the common people
 or is baar shahar main pattharon se kuchli teesri laash milti he
 Since this time also the corpse has been found in the morning, it is suspected that like the first two murders, this time also the crime has been carried out in the dark of night
 or sitam dekhie ki is baar bhi kaatil ne marane vaale ke gharavaalon ko phone kiya he
 And this time also the same two lines on the phone
 jaahir he, ab ye baat puri tarah saaf he ki teenon hi maamalon kaa ek duusare se naa sirf behad kareebi rishta he, balki teenon hi katl kaa gunahagaar koi ek hi he, jo naa sirf ek-ek logon kii jaan le rahaa he
 Rather, calling his family members from his mobile is trying to intimidate and make them cry
 lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir ye shaks he koun? or wo kyon ek-ek kar logon kii jaan le rahaa he?kaatil ke bare main bas itnaa jaanati he police
 
 
 The fear of the stone man has made the nights of Rajkot city sleepless
 sunsaan jagahon par akele hone vaale log jaldi ghar lautnaa chaahate hai
 Who knows
 kab, kahaan se stone main aa jaae
 And crush his head and move forward
 lekin ye stone main kitna shaatir he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki wo katl ke baad apane shikaar kaa mobile phone to luutata he, lekin usase unke gharavaalon ko ek kol karne ke baad mobile dobaaraa kabhi on nahin karata
 The Stone Man murderer is roaming freely in the city
 or katl ke is silsile ko shuru hue chalis dinon kaa vakt guzarane ke baavjood police ke haath khaali hai
 If the police know anything about this mysterious murderer, it is only because in the last forty days that this gullible murderer has not only killed three people one by one, but every time by crushing people with stones
 After killing his family members in the same way, he has also informed about the murder
 katl ke peeche kaa asli makasad kya he?chaanbin ke dauraan police ko ye pataa chalaa ki har katl ke saath kaatil ne marane waalon ke rupee-paise or duusari keemtee chijen luti, saath hi unka mobile phone bhi lut liya
 In such a situation, the police do not understand at the moment, what is the real motive behind these murders? If the motive is for loot, then why is the murderer crushing with stones in the same way and killing his victim and why does he call every time he grieves the family members of the victims of the crime? And if there is any other reason behind the murder, what is that? Is this the act of a psycho killer? Or the action of a gunman who has taken the life of innocents one by one to challenge him
 sawaal tamaam hai or philhal rajkot police ke paas jawaab ek bhi nahin
 This is not the first time in the history of Stone Manrajkot that came seven years ago
 balki aaj se thik saat saal pehle isi tarah gumnaam kaatil ne ek-ek kar teen logon ko pattharon se kuchal kar maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 It was a day
 or ek aaj kaa din
 The return of this stone slayer reminds people of the same old days
 jaankaar bataate hai ki saal 2009 main bhi thik isi tarah teen logon ko pattharon se kuchal kar maare jane kii vaardaat saamne ai thi
 After this, the police arrested two people
 lekin jab in logon ne katl ke peeche kii kahani sunai, to pulisavaale bhi chaunk gaye
 Murder for record only! In 2009, two murderers murdered three people just for making records
 wo mumbai ke serial killer raghav raman ke katl kaa record todna chaahate the
 It is said of Raghav Raman that he killed 55 people during his time
 haalanki saat saal pehle ke rajkot ke kaatil tab subooton ke abhaav main bari ho gaye the
 But the important thing was that after the arrest of both, the chain of murder was stopped in those days
 ab ek baar phir se rajkotpulice ke saamne waisi hi chunautihai
 The challenge is to catch this new stone man aka stone murderer aka serial killer
 or ye bhi ek ittefaq hi he ki idhar rajkot is nae serial killer se dar se sahamaa he
 On the other hand, a film on the dreaded serial killer Raghav Raman from his era in Bollywood is almost ready

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, AIADMK won 37 out of 39 seats in Tamil Nadu

 The AIADMK had earlier constituted three committees for the election manifesto and the alliance
 lekin kuch sthaneey muddon ko lekar bijepi ke rukh ke chalate AIADMK ne gathbandhan karnaa munasib nahin samajha
 The most prominent issue in this is about the Cauvery dispute, in which the party believes that the BJP government at the Center ignored Tamil Nadu keeping Karnataka's interest in mind

 It is believed that these two camps came together after the mediation of the BJP and the threat of disintegration of AIADMK was averted

 isamen ek aisa faisla liya gaya jisane raaje se logon kaa dhyaan hataane kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 a new issue of changing the subject of discussion was raised in the state: a massive reshuffle in the police department
 apane adhikariyon ke liye raaje kaa sandesh ekadam sidhaa tha: prashasan ko svachh karo
 On 19 June, 65 IPS officers were transferred
 niskriy pade bhrashtachar nirodhak beuro (asibi) par vishesh rup se dhyaan diya gaya or isamen tejatarraar adhikariyon ko bhej diya gaya
 These included the new chief director general of the bureau Navdeep Singh and inspector general Dinesh M

 Since then, more than 100 arrests have been made till 27 September
 lekin aalochakon kaa kahana he ki inamen se adhikansh giraftaaryaan maamuli aparaadhon ke maamle main kii gai hai
 For instance, in June, the arrest of Mool Chand Mali, an assistant engineer in the electricity department, was allegedly taking a bribe to re-connect an electrical connection to a farm in Ajmer

 Six other people from across the state were also arrested by noon that day
 phir navdeep singh or dinesh raaje ke paas gaye or bataaya ki ve khadaan vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv ashok singhvi ko giraftaar karne ja rahe hai

 It allegedly cost Rs 22 crore

 Finally, Singhvi was arrested when a bribe deal was executed for a large mine
 singhvi ke vakeelon kaa kahana he ki unke khilaaf rishwat kaa koi maamla nahin banataa, kyonki unhen na range haathon pakadaa gaya, na unase koi rakam pakadi gai
 State Congress chief Sachin Pilot claimed that the Center had collected evidence against Singhvi so that Raje could not save her
 ve kehete hai, ''sheersh ke sahyog ke bina koi iees afasar itane str par bhrashtachar nahin kar saktaa
 We have demanded a CBI inquiry into the allocations issued by Singhvi
 '' baharhaal, congress ke liye is kathith khanan or license dhandhe se siyaasi laabh uthaanaa kathin ho saktaa he, kyonki raaje sarkaar khadaan aavanton main gahalot sarkaar kii niti kaa hi anusaran kar rahi thi
 In January this year, Singhvi had issued allocation orders for over 1,400 mines before the ordinance was issued by the Center
 raaje ab is bhrashtachar nirodhak abhiyaan ke jariye november main antarrashtriya niveshkon ke sacvamelan 'rajasthan udai' se pehle apni sarkaar kii 'svachh chhavi' banane kii ummid kar rahi hai

" ''sanyog se yah badi karrwai sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ke pradesh daure ke dauraan hui
 It is necessary for Raje to give the right signal to the Sangh as the Sangh has supported him in the Fine Case
 raaje ke ek sahyogi ne sanket diya ki kuch hafton main abhi or giraftaaryaan ho sakati hai
 Over the past decade, the ACB and the state government have been notorious for not allowing such cases to be closed and prosecuted

 ’ The White House's new press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, has been scratched in a "pullout" of the US press pool on Sunday with North Korean security personnel
 samachar agency associated press ke anusaar, ye log america raashtrapati donald trump kii uttari korea ke netaa kim jong un ke saath hui mulaakaat ko cover karne ke liye gaye the
 According to the news agency AP, the Secret Service had to intervene after North Korean guards pushed them to prevent American reporters from entering the inter-korean House of Freedom
 patrakaron dwaara twitor par kii gai poston main bataaya gaya he ki america media ko andar jane dene main madad karne ke liye steffaini greesham halle-gulle main shaamil huin
 Video footage shows Stefanie telling members of the Grisham press 'go, go', and crosses the person standing in front of the camera
 camera uthaae ek anya purush unke saamne se guzar jaataa he
 Prior to the pullout, the press outside the building were told that they would not be given entry, but only then an American official told them they were allowed inside
 video main ek mahila shorsharabe ke bich america pool ko bheetar jane ke liye kahati dikh rahi he
 Jennifer Jacobs, senior reporter for the White House for 'bloomberg', said, "north Korean security personnel were more strict, and sometimes even exposed to American reporters, leaving nothing to be seen
" 
 
 khinchataan ke dauraan naubat 'hathapayee tak bhi' pahunch gai thi
 
 
 "later, according to CNN, Stephanie Grisham was seen directing reporters outside the House of Freedom and also with US President Donald Trump on the DMZ
 is ghatana par tippanee ke aagrah par philhal steffaini greesham yaa white house ne koi jawaab nahin diya he
 Was the mob angry just behind what happened in Dimapur? Or there is a big and deep conspiracy behind it, which is still covered
 asal baat to jaanch ke baad hi saamne aa sakegi, lekinfilhal jo tasvirubhar kar saamne aa rahi he wo kaaphi dhundhlee he
 a prisoner is brought out from within the security of the prison
 use ghaseet kar saat kilometre dur le jaaya jaataa he or phir chauraahey par nirvastr karke peet-peet kar maar diya jaataa he
 Can all this be done so easily? According to the report quoting a police officer from Dimapur, the police force could not be used on the crowd because girls in school dresses were walking ahead
 aarope par sawalareport darj karai gai he ki khan ne peedit yuvati ko do baar nashila padaarth khilaakar uske saath dushkarm kiya
 Then he was given five thousand rupees to keep his mouth shut
 haalanki, kuch media reporton main ek tivi channel par us hotel ke sisitivi footage ko dikhaae jane kii baat saamne ai he
 In this, the first accused and the victim are coming and going to the hotel comfortably
 yadi ye sach he to is ghatana kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he jiske saamne aane se pehle hi 'nyaay' kar diya gaya
 If we look at this whole incident, many questions arise
 1
 The biggest question is how did the crowd reach the accused? Even if you believe that police officer, is it such an easy task for schoolgirls to break through the prison door? Is prison security so weak? Security arrangements at Dimapur Central Jail are handed over to the paramilitary forces
 kya schuli chaatr itane sakasham the ki jail kaa majboot darwaja tod kar ghus gaye? to is suraksha ghere ko mahaj kuch schuli chaatraon se tod daalaa yaa unke saath bheed main asaamaajik tatv bhi shaamil the?2
 It is said that the crowd had a photograph of the accused
 ye tasviir kuch ke haathon main thi to kuch logon ke mobile par
 Suppose people had a picture with which they would have identified the accused
 lekin unhen ye kisne bataaya ki aaropee saiyad sharif khan he kis cell main? agar bheed main aage aage schuli chatraayen chal rahi thim to unhen kaise pataa ki sharif ko jis cell main rakhaa gaya he us tak pahunchane kaa rasta koun sa he?3
 If the security was not strong enough to stop the mob, then why were additional arrangements not made? Police can be seen beating people publicly on trivial matters
 aksar aisi kisi na kisi ghatana kaa video soshal media par dekha ja saktaa he? phir police prashasan is maamle main itnaa sust kaise rah gaya?koun tha aaropee?assam ke karimganj ke rahane vaale second-hand car or scrap dealer saiyad sharif khan ko pehle bangladeshi bataaya gaya tha
 Sharif's brother Jamaluddin Khan says that his entire family is in the army
 jamaluddin ke anusaar vah or unka ek or bhai, kamaal khan is vakt bhartiya sena kii assam regiment main hai
 Another brother of his, Imamuddin Khan, was also in the army who died in the 1999 Kargil War
 pita saiyad hossain khan bhartiya vaayu sena se ritair hue the
 
 
 
 or raajaneetasam ke mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ko bhi shaq he ki ye balaatkaar kaa maamla nahin he
 His statements in the media are indicating this
 vaise unhen khaas phikr aaropee saiyad sharif khan ke assam ke nivasee hone ke kaaran he
 In this case, Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray has also come out with a statement in which he has described the Dimapur incident as a justice of destiny
 shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main thakare kehete hai ki jo dilli main nahin ho sakaa wo nagaland main ho gaya or logon ko nagaland ke logon se sikh leni chahie
 last question
 
 
 nyaay kaa naiysargik siddhant he ki gunahagaar bhale hi chhot jaae par kisi begunaah ko sajaa na di jaae
 Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Aamir Kasab was seen by the entire country firing bullets on the TV screen
 phir bhi use nyaayik prakriya se guzarane kaa mauka diya gaya
 To get full legal help, a proper lawyer was arranged, and then decided
 lekin dimapur main na bahes, na jirah sidhe insaaf? or ye kaisaa insaaf jab ye sabit hi nahin hua ki aaropee hi gunahagaar tha
 By the way, who were the people in Dimapur crowd? Did he just want to kill one of the accused in the rape or especially the person Syed Sharif Khan who was accused of rape? It is important to get an answer to this question
