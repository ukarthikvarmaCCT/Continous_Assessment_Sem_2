 yahi kaaran he ki bollywood jammu or kashmir par aksar kahaniyaan gadhata aayaa he
 Known as Jannat on earth, not only has the beauty of Kashmir been brought to the camera but it has also been able to highlight the tragedy and dark aspects of this place
 60 ke dashak main kashmir bollywood filmon ke liye prime lokation maani jaati thi
 The first half of the 1961 film Junglee was shot in the snowy mountains of Srinagar
 shammi kapur ne is film main 'chaahe koi mujhe junglee kahe' gane ke saath jabardast lokapriyata hasil kii thi
 With the success of this song, Kashmir became the first choice of tourists apart from Bollywood
 iske baad kai filmon main kashmir kii khubsuurati ko bhunaane kaa kaam kiya gaya
 Most of the songs in the film Kali Kali were shot around Dal Lake
 kashmir kii vaadiyon main cycle chalaati mahilaayein, sthaneey logon kii dincharya jaise kai angel in filmon main shoot hue
 At the same time, Kashmir was seen only in songs in many films, many films were also released in which the backdrop was made to Kashmir
 saal 1965 main ai film araju ek sking chapinyan or sthaneey ladki kii lav story par aadhaarit thi
 The Shashi Kapoor starrer Jab Jab Phool Khile, released in 1965 on the backdrop of Kashmir, proved to be a Bollywood blockbuster
 kashmir kii khubsuurati or karishmai liriks ke sahare us daur ke kai gane amar ho gaye hai
 There are many songs like Pardesio to Na Ankhian, a Nargis Mastana, Pukarta Chala Hoon Main, Yeh Chand Sa Roshan Face, which have not only made people aware of the paradise on earth, but also the most brilliant romantic and philosophical songs in the history of Bollywood i managed to get my name registered
 kashmir kii dal jhil main shoot hua 'ye chand sa roshan cheharaa' ko aaj bhi bollywood ke sabase romantic clasik main shumaar kiya jaataa he
 But over time, the local politics of Kashmir changed and its effect was seen in films as well
 bharat pakistan ke bich badhate tanaav, aatanki ghatnaon, algaavvaad or kashmir main bhartiya sena ke jamaavade ke baad tamaam filmon main dikhne vaala kuubasurat kashmir badalata gaya
 The snowy mountains, the beautiful instruments still appear in the backdrop, but the subject of the films shifted from love and romance to topics like politics, war, army mission, terrorism
 90 ke dashak main kashmir main badhate tanaav ke chalate filmon ke subjects main jabardast badlaav dekhne ko mila
 Bollywood started trying to highlight the dark aspects spread in this beautiful valley
 ruthik roshan kii mishan kashmir se lekar tahaan, phna, rojaa, sikandar, haidar jaisi tamaam filmein aisi raheen jo kashmir kii antadiyon main faili traasadee ko dikhaane kii koshish karti najar ain
 These films were not only capturing the serial plaintiffs on camera, but were also trying to show the gray shades of the army in Kashmir, the general public of Kashmir and the social and other political culture on the silver screen
 kai baar yah bhi dikhaane kii koshish hui ki kaise ghati main ek puri peedi apni jindagi main hinsa ke chalate badale kii aag ke liye utaaru he, kaise kuch maukaparast or algaavvaadi log apni raajnneeti chamakaane ke liye aise yuvaaon kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 By showing many such rivalries and conflicts with beautiful litigants, people of other countries got exposed to the dark truth with the help of many films
 kashmir kii reality ke hisaab se use lekar bollywood filmon kaa nerrative teji se badla he, aise main centre sarkaar ke taaja faisle ke baad ummid kii ja sakati he ki kashmir main chizein teji se sakaaratmak disha main badalengi
 Home Minister Amit Shah has announced the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir
 sarkaar ne saaf kiya ki kashmir ko rajya se centre shasit pradesh banaaya jayega taaki vahaan faile aatank par kaabo paaya ja sake or aam kashmiriyon kii jindagi main vikaas kii raah majboot ho sake
 This step is also seen as an attempt to bring people of Kashmir and the rest of the country together
 dekhnaa ye hoga ki kashmir main chijen vaaki sakaaratmak disha main aage badhegin yaa vahaan ke halaat bad se badtar hote jaaenge, aise main ye dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki aage aane vaale saalon main kashmir ko lekar bollywood aatank or dwandv ke bane banaae dark nerrative par hi kaam karegaa yaa phir kashmir se judi filmon main bhi badlaav dekhne ko milegaa

 The Rajghat Satyagraha of the Narmada Bachao Andolan has been postponed between Thursday and Friday on late night by issuing orders to open the dam gates and on the assurance of the Barwani Collector
 sabhi prabhaviton kaa sarkaar or andolan ke pratinidhiyon ke saath joint survey karaayaa jayega
 Representatives of the movement will also be included in government rehabilitation committees
 narmada ghati vikaas praadhikaran ke mantri se jald mulaakaat karai jaaegi
 But the question is why some Medha Patkar is standing up to save Narmada even after 39 years
 ek baar phir narmada bachaao andolan ke binar tal dub prabhavit dharne par baithe the, dam kaa get khulaa, behatar bhavishya kaa aashwaasan mila
 
 
 Drowns got up from the affected dharna
 aaj kii taarikh main narmada kaa jalastr 131 meter se thodaa neeche he, lekin aitihaasik rajghat chaaron ore pani se ghira he 
 
 
 Rajghat Kukra, which is undergoing sinking of Sardar Sarovar dam, was rapidly flooded on Thursday morning
 
 
 buudhvaar raat 11 baje colector or espi nirikshan ke liye pahunche the 
 
 
 Instructions were given to displace the shops, houses, temples and ashrams in the submergence area in the submerged area since Thursday morning over the rising water in the Narmada at night
 do saal pehle in visthapiton ke is ashiyane kii tasviir hamane aapako dikhaai thi
 Today, when their anger erupted, the condition of these teen sheds did not change
 logon ne ye bhi aarope lagaaya ki plat die, lekin 5
 80 lakh package was not received, how to go in such a situation
 pichley chaar dinon se narmada kaa jal str back water se badhata hi ja rahaa he
 The tributaries of Narmada are in spate due to the rains that started on Wednesday
 jiske chalate guuruuvaar ko narmada kaa jal str pal-pal kar badhata chalaa gaya
 The only way to arrive at night was also closed
 jiske chalate rajghat aane-jane ke liye sadak par pani main naav chalaani padi
 Although this was not the first time, a series of dams being built in the Narmada Valley ejected the village and population in a wholesale sense
 harsood ko hamane yaad kiya or bhul gaye
 
 
 But not only one and a half hundred such villages got absorbed in Sardar Sarovar
 sarkaar ne bataane kii koshish kii baandh logon kii jarurat hai, lekin kai maukon par ye usase zyada sarkari zid bhi lagi
 When people put up arms for displacement, 36 hundred crores rupees were paid for such corruption that temporary sheds
 
 
 sthai banate gaye
 Khamiaja Sardar Sarovar's nearly 40 thousand families in 193 villages are still suffering! The matter was so complicated that the Sardar Sarovar Dam project on the Narmada River, which had passed many decades, was inaugurated in 1961 by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 lekin gujarat, madhya pradesh or rajasthan ke bich pani ke bantwaare par sahmati nahin bani 1969 main, sarkaar ne narmada jal vivaad nyaaydhikaran kaa gathan kiya taaki jal sambandhi vivaad kaa hal ho 1979 main nyaaydhikaran ekamat hua tab jaakar narmada ghati pariyojna ne janm liya 1985 main is pariyojna ke liye vishwa bank ne 450 karod dollar kaa lone dene kii ghoshnaa kii sarkaar ne kaha pariyojna se bijli paidaa hogi teen rajyon main 2
 There will be irrigation of 27 crore hectares of land, but the big thing was that it had to pay 37000 hectares of land in three states
 248 gaanv main lakhon kii aabaadi visthapit hui, visthaapan main karodon kaa bhrashtachar bhi hua
 When the committee headed by SS Jha conducted an investigation, it was found that out of 3636 registries, 1800 are fake
 zamin par kisi rasukhdaar kaa kabja he, tha jabaki registry kisi visthapit ke naam par
 Not only this, crores of crores of rupees were made at about 88 rehabilitation sites
 in visthapiton ke liye medha patekar apane saathiyon ke saath khadi hui 
 
 
 The general assembly in Harsud in 1989, the Sangharsh Yatra became the first stop in 1990, a hunger strike in 1993 and the World Bank pulled out of the project in 1994
 1995 main supreme court ne kah diya ki sarkaar baandh ke baaki kaaryon ko tab tak roak de jab tak visthapit ho chuke logon ke purnvas kaa prabandh nahin ho jaataa
 On October 18, 2000, the Supreme Court approved the resumption of the dam and increasing its height to 90 meters
 lekin ye bhi joda ki yah sunishchit kiya jaae ki paryaavaran ko khatra nahin hoga, punarvaas achche se kiya jayega
 New guidelines were given for the rehabilitation of displaced people according to which a primary school, a panchayat house, a hospital, a system of water and electricity and a religious place was to be built for the displaced people at 500 people
 
 
 lekin hua kuch nahin
 Medha Patkar says that even today there are thousands of families in each village, while in the submergence area of sardar Sarovar, it is not legal to rehabilitate their houses without rehabilitation
 gujarat 30 karod nahi de rahaa he naa bijli de rahaa he aisi sthiti main kyon dubaaen 192 gaanv use aaj aage badhanaa jaruri he
 By the time 56 years later, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the dam on its birthday, its maximum height was 138
 68 meter tay ho chuki thi
 Although the BJP government was in Madhya Pradesh when the dam was inaugurated, there has been a change in the attitude of the government after changing the government in the state
 madhya pradesh sarkaar kaa kahana he ki gujarat bijli tak nahin de rahaa he evam hajaaron logon kaa punarvaas baaki he, jiskaa kharch gujarat ko hi dena he
 In such a situation, Madhya Pradesh cannot provide more water to Gujarat
 baharhaal bijli, pani, pragati ke daavon ke bich behaal log hai 
 
 
 Even after 39 years, for whom some meritorious Patkar stands against the stream

 ab rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki congress party ne assam or gujarat ke mukhyamantriyon ko gahari neend se jagaa diya he, lekin pradhanmantri ab bhi so rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi, who is holidaying in Simla with sister Priyanka Vadra and her children, said this in a tweet on Wednesday afternoon
 darasal, assam or gujarat main bijepi kii sarkaar he or donon rajyon main kisaanon ko raahat di gai he
 The Congress party has managed to wake up the cm's of Assam & Gujarat from their deep slumber
 PM is still asleep
 We will wake him up too
 — Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)december 19, 2018bijli bill or karj mafgujrat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ne kisaanon ke 650 karod rupee ke bijli bill maaf kar die hai
 Whereas in Assam, debt waiver has been announced for farmers
 haalanki yahaan par kisaanon ko adhiktam 25 hajaar rupee tak hi karjamaafee milegi
 These decisions of both bjp-ruled states are being attributed by the Congress to the debt waiver done in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 mangalvaar ko rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki hamane jo vaada kiya tha wo puraa kar diya
 He had said that the Congress and other opposition parties would pressurize Prime Minister Narendra Modi to forgive the debts of farmers and will not let them sleep till then
 ab rahul gandhi ne gujarat or assam kii bijepi shasit sarkaron ke faisle ko aadhaar banaate hue ek baar phir pradhanmantri narendra modi ko gheraa he ki vah ab bhi so rahe hai, ham unhen bhi jagaayenge
 Rahul had given this statement on Tuesday (december 18), Rahul Gandhi had said, 'in the last four and a half years, Modi ji took your money and put three and a half lakh crores in the pocket of these 15-20 industrialists
 unhone do bharat banaae- pehla 15-20 logon kaa, rin maafee kaa, nijee vimaanon kaa or doosraa chote vyapaariyon, dukaanon, mazdooron or kisaanon kaa
 Rahul Gandhi had said that his party had promised that loan waiver would begin in 10 days
 do rajyon main chah ghante bhi nahin lage or tisare rajya main aisa hone ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you that the Congress party has recently formed government in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and the Chief Ministers in two states passed the loan waiver file within few hours of taking oath

 US President Barack Obama, sitting with his top national security advisors last Sunday afternoon in the Situation Room on the ground floor of the White House, admits that 40 minutes of his life was spent in a campaign against Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden in the compound in Pakistan's Abbottabad Had the hardest moments
 laden ke khilaaf abhiyaan ke dauraan tanaav bhare un palon main obama or unke rashtriya suraksha sahaayakon kii dhadkan kai baar tej hui
 The President said in his first interview after bin Laden's death, "this (campaign) was the longest 40 minutes of my life
" aisi vyakulata tab hui thi tab sasha teen maah kii thi or use mastishk fever hua tha
 It was a very stressful situation
 obama ne sibies news ke sho 60 minutes main kaha ki sichuation room main maujuud har vyakti tanaav main tha or laden ke khilaaf abhiyaan kii avadhi badhane se unki ghabrahat badhati ja rahi thi
 The world's most wanted and notorious terrorist Osama bin Laden (54) was killed on May 2 in a successful operation by American forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki vishesh america balon ke abhiyaan main kareeb 40 minute kaa samay laga or in 40 minuton ke aakhri daur main laden maaraa gaya
 The US President said, we were watching the situation
 ham dekh rahe the ki parisar ke aasapaas kya ho rahaa tha lekin parisar ke andar ke ghatnakram ke bare main hamen koi jaankaree nahin mil paa rahi thi
 Obama said that the campaign that was approved was not empty of danger as none of his (president's) assistant or intelligence officers were 100 percent convinced of Laden's presence in Abbottabad
 unhone kaha, main kahuunga ki yah mahatvapurn tha
 This was important because we have shed a lot of blood and money in the fight against Al Qaeda
 2001 se yahaan tak ki kenya sthit duutavas main bam visphot ke pehle se
 Obama said, "I told myself that if we get a good chance in which we may not completely defeat Al Qaeda but destabilize it badly, it is more important than political danger and danger to our men
" raashtrapati ne kaha ki unhen abhiyaan ke bilkul aakhir main pataa chalaa ki laden maaraa gaya
 He said that the confusion was intact until every person sat in the helicopter and went back to the hideout
 thikaane par pahunch kar sainikon ne kaha ki jeronimo maaraa gaya
 Obama said, Jeronimo was a pseudonym for Laden
 jaahir he ki hamaare aadmi andhere main tir chhod rahe the isliye har koi satark tha lekin sabhi ko ummid bhi thi
 He said he breathed a sigh of relief after the operation and wanted American troops to leave Pakistan's border and safely land by helicopter at the hideout
 raashtrapati ne kaha ki apane dal par unhen bahut garv he or unke kaam se vah santusht hai
 The President said, it was only when the soldiers reached their hideout that it was clearly confirmed that he was Laden
 tasviren lee gai thim
 The face was analyzed and made absolutely clear that he was the same
 hamane ab tak diene pareekshan nahin kiya tha lekin ab tak ham 95 fisadi aashwast ho gaye the

 ’ The chairman of the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee, surrounded by controversies, Suresh Kalmadi, hit back at Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, saying that the blasphemy imposed on the Chief Minister's Organizing Committee is 'very disappointing and unwarranted' and intensified the corruption present in its departments should do
 dikshit ne aayojan samiti par kathith taur par bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaaye the or iske ek din baad kalmari ne karaara javaabi bayaan dete hue kaha ki chup rahane kaa matlab kamajori kaa sanket nahin mana janaa chahie or aayojan samiti ab or ‘bali kaa bakra’ nahin bananaa chaahegi
 Kalmadi said, "the stigma of corruption imposed on Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit's organizing committee of 2010 Commonwealth Games is very disappointing and unnecessary
 kisi par ungali uthaanaa sahi nahin he jabaki unhen (dikshit) apane vibhaagon main maujuud bhrashtachar par aatmamanthan karnaa chahie
 He said, "he has said that the way the Organizing Committee functions is quite mysterious, while the Commonwealth Games Chief Michael Fennell described the Games as extraordinary and successful
" ’kalmari ne kaha ki aayojan samiti pehle hi pradhanmantri ke jaanch panel gathit karne kaa swaagat kar chuki he or unhone ummid jataayi ki shungalu samiti sirf aayojan samiti dwaara 1620 karod rupaye ke bajet ko hi nahin balki dilli sarkaar dwaara kharch kiye gayi 16,000 karod rupaye kii bhi jaanch karegi
 He said, 'I was silent despite the constant allegations before the Games because i wanted to make the Games successful
 chup rahane kaa matlab kamajori kaa sanket nahin maananaa chahie
 Nor should restraint be considered a sign of guilt
 khelon ko yojit karnaa sabase mahatvapurn tha
 Kalmadi said, "we are confident that the culprits will not be spared, even if they are involved in any institution
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘rashtriya gaurav daanv par tha or main nahin chahta tha ki is par koi asar pade
 Our challenge was to maintain the morale of more than 4000 people
 ham aisa karne main safal rahe or khelon kaa safal aayojan kiya, lekin dashahara ke din main aayojan samiti kii taraf se bolnaa chahta hum
 We no longer want to be a scapegoat

 He said, 'the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee was responsible for organizing the Games
 ’unhone kaha, ‘mujhe garv ho rahaa he ki duniya ne in khelon ke aayojan ko safal qaraar kar diya
 All the competitors were according to the schedule
 ’ kalmari ne khel gaanv samay par taiyaar karne kaa shrey lene ke liye bhi dikshit kii aalochana kii
 He said, 'the game was successful with the efforts of Team India, which included a large number of people and agencies
 yah kisi ek vyakti kaa prayaas nahin tha
 Dixit's attempt to take credit for preparing the game village on time does not fit at all as it is teamwork

 If the accused says that he has been implicated under the conspiracy then the matter is different but if a DGP says that the victim is false then what will the police investigate the matter?

 Topping the India today-nielsen survey of the best science colleges in India, the department has come a long way since its modest debut
 agar shuruaati daur kii baat karen to ise fund ke rup main kuch khaas nahin mila karata tha

 a unique feature of Stephens, which justifies the top position of this college in the field of science, is the dedication to scientific research that the campus plays throughout the year
 college ne chaatro ke liye bangaloru ke indian academy of sciensej or jawaharlal nehru degree centre for advanced scientific research jaise pratishthit sansthaanon main 150 se adhik greeshmakaleen research project uplabdh karaae hai
 Ishwaran, who has taught chemistry at Stephens for the past 40 years, says, "this is not an exercise to brighten bio-data but is a real scientific study experience

 He told that he is working from morning to night for promotion
 manoj ne bataaya ki unase intervyuuj ke dauraan ek sawaal baar-baar poocha ja rahaa he
 It is a question to be told about his character
 manoj ne kaha ki ''apane kirdaar ke bare main baat karte-karte ab mujhe apane kirdaar se hi nafrat hone lagi he
 It seems that the character whom he played with great vigor has now started hating him

 bijepi shivasena ko 128 seat dene ko rajishivsena rajya main 135 seat maang rahi haimaharashtra main loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bhale hi shivasena or bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar koi takaraar nahin dekhne ko mili, lekin is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi vahi tasviir dekhne ko mil rahi he jaisi vidhansabha chunaav 2014 main dikhi thi
 The only difference is that this time the BJP is handling the steering of the alliance
 sutron ke mutabik bijepi ne shivasena ko saaf kar diya he ki pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main donon partiyon ne jitani seat jiti thi, utani siten donon dalon ke paas rahengi
 The remaining seats will be divided among them
 is hisaab se shivasena ko kareeb 115 siten mil rahi hai
 At the same time, Shiv Sena has objected to the bjp's division and said that during the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had said that the seat sharing will be equal in the assembly elections
 pichley saptaah shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha tha ki kuch dinon main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bhi gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa kar di jaaegi, lekin 7 din baad bhi iskaa elaan nahin hua he
 Let us know that Shiv Sena was not willing to go below 150 seats in the 2014 assembly elections and this is the reason why BJP is adopting a stale attitude

 Shiv Sena is seeking at least 135 seats
 seat bantwaaraa isliye bhi kathin ho rahaa he kyonki donon partiyon ne congress or ensipi ke netaaon ko apni party main bhar liya he
 Leaders joining BJP and Shiv Sena have left the Congress and NCP only after deciding their tickets on seats
 is kadam ko is tarah se bhi dekha ja rahaa he ki donon partiyaan gupt rup se gathbandhan ke maamle main alag se vidhansabha chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahi hai
 Uddhav Thackeray had made sarcastic remarks on Friday, saying that he had asked Fadnavis to prepare and list the Shiv Sena candidates list
 fadanvis taalamatol vaala rukh apanaae hue hai
 Sources say that Shiv Sena will accept the seat sharing according to the circumstances
 haalanki shivasena ke kuch netaa uddhav thakare par 135 se kam siton par samjhauta nahin karne kaa dabaav bana rahe hai

 About 500 employees of state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) have gone on an indefinite hunger strike to demand increase in salary
 ye sabhi karmchaaree duusari saarvajanik companiyon ke baraabar vetan dene or adhikariyon kii tarj par hi vetan kii samiksha karne kii maang kar rahe hai
 Significantly, HAL is the same company that was to manufacture Rafale aircraft in India under the deal under UPA government, but when the Modi government signed a new deal with the French government, it entrusted this work to the private company of Anil Ambani group
 Given
 isko lekar bhi kaaphi vivaad or raajnneeti hoti rahi he
 Suryadevara Chandrasekhar, the chief convener of all the employees 'unions of HAL, told news agency PTI,' Our salary has not been adjusted since 2017

 It continues in all nine units of HAL in seven states
 'union netaa ne kaha ki agxcutive kii tarj par hi vetan dene ke maamle ko nipataane ke liye company kaa prabandhan aage nahin aa rahaa he
 He said, “the salary of the executives has been settled in November 2017
 hamaari baatcheet jari he, lekin abhi tak yah benatija rahi he
 Therefore this deadlock has been created
 'duusari taraf, company prabandhan kaa kahana he ki unka vivaad asthaayee he

 The company said in a statement that it was neither logical nor legitimate to demand benefits and perks over or above those of executives, the executive's salary was reviewed ten years later on January 1, 2017
 duusari taraf, is dauraan baaki karmchaariyon ke vetan main do baar badhat ho chuki he
 hal's management believes that employees' salaries can only be reviewed from January 1, 2017, when unions cooperate and their demands are realistic and reasonable

 karmchaariyon ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi or raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman par company kii kshamta ko lekar galat kahani gadhane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Explain that while accusing corruption of Rafale plane deal, Rahul Gandhi has been continuously accusing the government of paying attention to HAL and giving preference to Reliance Defense

 In view of environmental pollution, the government has decided to run BS-6 fuel trains in the coming years
 yah jaankaree petroleum ministry ne supreme court ko di he
 The ministry has stated that from April 1, 2020, only BS-6 vehicles will be sold in the market across the country
 vahiin jo gaadiyaan BS-6 eendhan yukt nahin hongi wo 31 march 2020 tak hi bik sakengi
 Along with this, the Central Government told in the Supreme Court that the price of diesel for commercial and private vehicles cannot be kept separately
 vahinparyaavaran pradooshanse jude maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne EPCA (enwyrement palyushan privansion and protection kamity) se poocha ki kya pahchaan ke liye petrol-dijal BS- 3,4 or 6 ke liye alag alag rang ke steekar jari kiye ja sakate hai?court ne kaha ki isaki shuruyatgabhsh-6se kii ja sakati he
 The court suggested that the number plates of BS-6 vehicles should have a different color, so that they can be identified
 isse pehle pichhali sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne sarkaar se dilli main taxi kii jaankaree maangi thi
 The court had asked how many vehicles of Ola and Uber with different colors are present in Delhi
 iske jawaab main sarkaar ne court ko bataaya ki lagbhag 68 hajaar gaadiyaan taxi main chal rahi hai
 The EPCA said that most of the CNG in public transport in Delhi is driven but not with private vehicles
 supreme court ne suzav diya ki dilli ke taxi waalon ko BS-6 gaadi kharidne ke liye prerit kiya ja saktaa he
 For this they may be considered to provide some relief or benefit
 is maamle main supreme court 30 july ko agali sunwaayee karegi
 According to the Center for Science and Environment, the amount of sulfur from BS-6 fuel will be less than 5 times that of BS-4
 yah kaaphi clin ful he
 The use of this fuel will reduce pollution spreading in the old trains running on the roads
 BS-6 gadiyon main bhi advance emishan control system feet hoga
 However, its full benefits will be met when the vehicles are also built completely based on BS-6 technology

 paanch baar ke vishwa champion vishvanathan anand ab vishwa shatranj championships ke match main megnas carlson ke saamne karo yaa maro kii sthiti main hai chunki sirf chaar baziyaan bachi hai or vah puure ek ank se peeche hai
 Carlson 4 after eight bouts
 5
 3
 5 se aage hai or anand par kam se kam ek jeet darj karne kaa kaaphi dabaav he
 If this could not happen in the next two matches, it would be too late for Anand
 kal hone vaale nauven mukaable se pehle anand ke liye chintaa kaa sabab sirf match kii sthiti nahin, balki carlson kii taiyaari bhi hogi
 Anand made good preparations in the third match, but Carlson has come down with firm preparations since then
 norway ke is khilaadi ne nit nai chaalon ke alaava anand kii takat maani jane vaali shuruaati chaalon ke tilism ko bhi tod diya he
 In the eighth match, it became clear that Anand would have to prepare better
 carlson ne kaale moharon se kaaphi teji se chaalen chali jabaki anand ne kaaphi samay liya
 By the time his thinking came, the draw was almost over
 carlson ab khitaab barkaraar rakhane se sirf chaar drow dur he
 Carlson is not at fault for making mistakes and does his best to get close to the title
 anand ko ab safed yaa kaale moharon kii parvaah kiye bina apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa hoga taaki khud ko pechida halaat se baahar nikaal sake
 The Indian camp may be thinking of adopting another Cecilian defense, but Anand's crushing defeat in the sixth match will be in his mind
 anand chathe mukaable main shuruyaat main hi dabaav main aa gaye or usase ubar nahin sake
 Carlson has since dominated and neutralized Anand's initial moves
 anand kal kaale moharon se khelenge
 If there is any turning point in this match of the World Championship, it will come only in the next two days, because after that the path of Anand's return will be closed

 Although the love of cows in Mathura and Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh is well known, but the news of a German woman making a mission to Goseva itself is a pleasant feeling
 yadi aap mathura main govardhan parikrama karte hue radhakund se konhi gaanv kii taraf badhate hai to kasbaai basaavat se kuch furlongs dur hari chadar jaise dhan ke kheton ke bich achaanak gaay-bachhadon ke rambhaane kii aawaaj kaanon main padati he

 This is the address of 'mother of Thousand Calves' Sudevi Maid, who is a Nazir for the guards
 is goshaala main 1200 se adhik vruddh gaay, bail or bachade hai
 These animals are either sick or injured in an accident
 yahaan koi gaay chal nahin paati yaa phir kisi ko dikhaai nahin detaa
 Sudevi has dedicated herself to the selfless service of such cows
 do march 1958 ko germany ke berlin shahar main janmi sudevi daasi kaa mul naam fredrick irin brooning he
 She became very emotional when Aaj Tak spoke to her
 vah khud ke bare main bataati hai ki wo saal 1978-79 main bataur paryatak bharat ain thim
 She was just 20 years old then
 vah thailand, singapore, indonesia or nepal kii saiyr par bhi gayi lekin unka man braj main aakar hi laga
 Sudevi says that she continued to worship, chant and circumambulate Radhakund with Guru Diksha
 ek din unke padosi ne kaha ki unhen gaay paalni chahie
 He started with a cow rearing and gradually the order of cow rearing changed to the Goseva Mission

 When he got this news, he got his posting done at the German Embassy in Delhi to convince his only child
 pita ke lakh samajhane ke baad bhi vah apane nishchay par adi raheen
 Even today, his ambulance brings eight to ten cows every day
 jo yaa to kisi durghatana main ghayal hui hoti hai yaa vruddh or asahaay hai
 She treats them
 haalankigoshaala chalymanarakhane kii chunautiyaan bhi kam nahin hai
 She treats cows and calves as her children
 ab to duusari goshaalaon ne bhibimaar or vruddh gayonko unki goshaala main bhejnaa shuru kar diya he
 There is a system of keeping blind and injured cows separately in the cowshed
 vah unhen bina kisi naa-nukur ke unhen apane paas rakh leti hai
 He feels that his stay will ease his suffering
 goshaala main 60 log kaam karte hai
 His family also runs from Gaushala

 Life between the apps, he did not want to go and did not want to show
 wo jitne eps downlod karata wo utana hi dur ja rahi thi
 Now the issue was not about green and red, now the issue was about the gap between getting answers and being constantly online
 smart phone kii kahani or uski kahani ke bich ek nai kahani paidaa ho rahi thi
 He started using smiley, but can the feelings of the heart be included in few signs? Real had now gone virtual
 do chaar smaili ke bich simatata rishta wo kahata nahin tha or uske paas sunne kaa vakt nahin tha, eps kii divaani jo thahari
 Everything was being machined
 subah gurmarning kaa routine sa epa bi massej or shaam ko gudnite
 Throughout the day, if someone was burning between the lights of the chat being green and yellow, then someone was going to extinguish
 kaash tum timeline rivyuu hote jab chahta antag kar detaa
 Often he kept thinking
 wo to haar hi rahaa tha par wo bhi kya jeet rahi thi
 Some of the questions that were sparkling like a light burning on a chat are not Maggie ready in two minutes
 ye sori or thankyuu se nahin bahalate inako ehsaas chahie jo wats app or vibar jaise eps nahin dete use to aage janaa tha par ye to peeche janaa chahta tha jab real par virtual haaavee nahin tha
 Was it time to sign this relationship out or was it all virtual, not real
 wo hameshaa invizible rahaa karata tha virtual realty kii tarah jahaan he, vahaan he nahin
 
 
 Where it is not there cannot be there
 wo invizible hi aayaa tha or ab invizible hi vidaa kiya ja rahaa tha
 Perhaps being blocked is his destiny
 ab wo jawaab nahin detii thi or jo jawaab aate unamem jawaab se zyada sawaal khadey hote
 Chat lights had been closed for him
 ishaara saaf tha ab use janaa hoga sin out karne kaa vakt chukaa tha
 Can't be virtual real, lesson was given
 jindagi aage badhane kaa naam he peeche lautne kaa nahin

 Your film is inspired by real life? Papa wanted to become an engineer, Mummy said, "be a Charter Accountant, i couldn't become one
" phir papa se maine kaha, papa main nahin kar paaunga, phir mere papa ne kaha jo karnaa he karo, ye seen maine '3 idiyats' main daalaa, aise hi munna bhai kaa thukne vaala seen, chor pakadaney vaala seen, koshish karata hum asal zindagi se zyaada se zyaada prerit hokar likhuun
 How close are your films to your father? Papa died 2 years ago, all the films are very special, Papa liked 'munnabhai' very much, Papa who came from Pakistan, we grew up in Nagpur, my father i was very happy with me, it is very happy
 aapke kaam ko dekhakar log hausale ko neeche bhi dikhaane kii koshish karte honge?haa 'munnabhai' ke dauraan bhi kai log bole 'ye gandhigiri' koun dekhegaa, lekin aakhir main kaam ko dekh kar log saraahe, or meraa moraal or badha, meri film ke baad kaaphi utsaah badha he, or logon ke andar badlaav aayaa he, log aaj bhi bataate hai ki kaise wo badal gaye hai
 How was the casting of 3 Idiots? Aamir was in his 40s, and i had to make a college film, i had to make 3 young students, tried many actors, one day Aamir and Vinod Chopra talked, Aamir heard the script on the phone
 And said that i will play the character of a student, the look test was done and then the film was made, and you watch carefully all the people of the college were kept a little bit older
 aamir, baman, sanjay, kaise hai ye log kaam karne ke liye?har actor kii apni majbooti he, aamir or baman reharsal karne main yaqiin rakhte hai, sanju aisa he ki uski apni style he or wo 2 pej kaa dialaag 5 minute main pard to letaa he lekin apni style se hi deliver karata he, arshad bhi apni tarah se prastuti karata he
 i am very lucky to get to work with such actors
 chaahe wo karina yaa anoushka hi kyon na ho
 You play a lot with emotion, how are you able to do this? We used to watch horror movies since childhood, so that i would like to make such films, which would make every emotion, if we get back on cycle and scared
 Touch aapaki filmon ke kirdaaron ke naam bahut anokhe hote hai, aisa kyon?main amit ji kaa bahut bada fain tha, unka har film main 'vijay' naam hota tha
 In the same way, Shahrukh Raj, Rahul in every film
 isliye maine kaha ki jab bhi filmein banaaungaa to anokhe naam rakhuunga, to rencho, ranchhoddas, jagat janani, 
 
 mujhe yaad he mere senior kaa naam tha 'funsukh ladakhi'
 And the name of a tea shop was 'wangdu Tea Stall', then took Wangdu from there and became 'funsukh Wangdu'
 sanjay dutt se kaise mili? unki life par aap film banane vaale hai?sanju jab parole par aayaa to mujhe laga ki usko main bahut jaanata hum, lekin jab wo aayaa tha to usne jo bhi bataanaa shuru kiya, to main chaunk gaya, or har din main or abhijaat 6-7 ghante sanju ke saath baithe rahete the, aisa 25 din tak kiya hamane or uski zindagi kisi kahani se kam nahin he
 Underworld, films, link ups, weddings, relationships, so we thought her story should speak
 drugs cese, court cese, papa ke saath sambandh, aisi kahani zindagi main nahin suni, hamane kaam shuru kar diya he
 Ranbir will become Sanjay? Ranbir looks very similar, like Sanjay Dutt's younger days, if you see Rocky in the film, Ranbir can become good Sanjay Dutt
 aap dhyaan se dekhen to ranbir us kirdaar ke kaaphi had tak kareeb dikhataa he
 Who will come in Munnabhai's series now? Sanjay will remain the same, whatever happens
 aapaki heroin munnabhai siries main badalati rahati hai?mere dost abhijaat ne bataaya kii charlie chaplin kii filmon main sirf charlie yaad rah jaataa he, uske aas-paas actress yaad nahin rahati
 So we have also given Sanjay Dutt the center character, and according to the script we take the heroine
 aapkaa betaa kya kar rahaa he?wo abhi padhai kar rahaa he, choti choti camere se filmein banaata rahata he, ab main kuch kah bhi nahin saktaa kyonki maine 3 idiyats banaayi he
 And one day i said 'you don't study', then he said that you father has said that whatever you want, do whatever you want

 com / zffskzypgq bijepi or aemoes ke campon main aatank kii training di jaati he
 After saying this in a full meeting, Home Minister Shinde retracted as soon as he came out
 unhone kaha ki maine hindu nahin, bhagava aatank ke bare main kaha tha
 At the Jaipur Chintan Shivir, the Congress was churning on Mission 2014 when a spark by Sushil Kumar Shinde's statement emerged which turned into shoals
 vaise sangh or bijepi par sampradayikta kaa aarope nayaa nahin he, lekin is baar desh ke grahamantri ne hindu aatankwaad shabd kaa istemaal karke bade vivaad ko hawa de di
 Sushil Kumar Shinde had so much to say that the BJP was furious
 bijepi ne scindia ke bayaan ko sirf durbhagyapurna nahin balki desh ke maahaul ke liye khataranaak qaraar de diya
 As Shinde spoke about the BJP like Nashtar, many Congress leaders came forward to say the same thing loudly
 manishankar ayyar ne to yahaan tak kah daalaa ki scindia kii baton se ve sau fisadi sahamat hai
 However, as the uproar increases, the process of cleaning also started
 pehle rajeev shukla scindia ke bachaav main koode, phir khud grahamantri scindia apni baat se palat gaye or sawaalon kii bauchhaar ke bich dabe man se ye bhi kabool kiya ki hindu aatankwaad shabd kaa istemaal karke unhone galati kii
 But the saffron brigade does not agree with these efforts for cleanliness
 aarushi-hemraj dohare hatyakand kii sunwaayee taal di gai he
 The date of January 21 has now been fixed for hearing on the closure report
 rajesh talwaar ke vakil ne aarushi hatyakand main sibiai kii closer report kii ek kapi maangi
 At this, the court ordered the CBI to give a copy of the closure report to Talwar
 haalanki sibiai ke vakil ne yah kehete hue iskaa virodh kiya ki talwaar maamle main pehle giraftaar ho chuke hai
 The CBI counsel told the court that it is for the court to decide whether to accept the closure report or order further investigation into the case
 madhya pradesh main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko barabari par khadaa karne kaa dwandv abhi thama nahin he
 Such is evident in the preparations for Shivraj Singh Chauhan's Jan Ashirwad Yatra to be held in the state
 ujjain main yatra ko lekar lage hording-binar se modi kaa cheharaa gaayab he
 Narendra Modi is emerging as a big leader in the BJP
 party ne unhen bhale hi pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar ghoshit na kiya ho, magar chunaav samiti kaa adhyaksh banaakar apni ranneeti jaahir to kar hi di he
 At the same time, among the leaders who have kept away from Modi, Chief LK Advani has not hesitated to call Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Chauhan as Chief Minister better than Modi
 modi ke mukaable chouhan ko behatar mukhyamantri bataae jane ke baad se hi adwani bijepi main kamjor pade hai, vahi modi kii sthiti samay dar samay majboot hoti ja rahi he
 Despite this, the BJP of Madhya Pradesh is still not ready to accept Modi as a big leader
 yahi kaaran he ki rajya main hone vaale kisi bhi bhavy aayojan main modi kii tasviren tak najar nahin aati hai
 The latest case is of Chief Minister Chouhan's Jan Ashirwad Yatra
 yatra ke liye ujjain ko dulhan kii tarah sajaayaa ja rahaa he, har taraf binar-poster lage hai
 In these posters, besides Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Rajnath Singh, Narendra Singh Tomar and Chief Minister Chauhan, pictures of local leaders are visible, but Modi is missing
 iske saath hi rajya kii purv mukhyamantri uma bharti bhi in bannron se gaayab hai
 The government's Food and Civil Supplies Minister Paras Jain says that Modi has a place in the heart of every youth, but he could not respond to the lack of pictures of Modi in the hoarding
 vahiin party ise koi raajnneeti yaa ranneeti kaa hissaa maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Modi has been entrusted with election campaigning across the country by the BJP, but the BJP in Madhya Pradesh is still not able to accept his stature easily

 Sunni Ulema Firangi Mahali has questioned the government's decision and said that the government should have consulted the Maulana and the Ulema before taking such a decision
 yogi sarkaar ne shaadiyon ke panjikaran ko tamaam sarkari yojanaon se link karne kaa faisla kiya he taaki sabhisarkari yojanaonmen pati-patni or parivaar kaa puraa vivaran sarkaar ke paas rahe

 log in khaas lamhaa:june, 2013 main maharajaganj up-chunaav main jeetakhalis uplabdhiyon kii baat kii jaae to 2013 lalu prasad yadav ke liye baþt sakaaratmak nahin dikhataa
 He led his party to a landslide victory in the Maharajganj Lok Sabha by-election held in June but lost his Lok Sabha membership due to his conviction in the fodder scam and will no longer contest elections for the next 6 years
 nitish se alag hone ke baad bijepi ne rashtriya janata dal se mukhya vipaksh kaa darja bhi liya
 But in politics and life, many times non-visible and non-countable factors are more important
 vastav main 2013 bihar kii raajnneeti main lalu prasad yadav kaa hi saal rahaa he
 By 2012, Lalu looked relatively weak in the electoral political impact in Bihar, although all the by-elections before Maharajganj also saw an increase in Lalu's vote but Lalu remained behind the NDA till last year
 lekin 2013 ne lalu ko ek baar phir agali pankti main laa diya or bihar kii raajnneeti main argedy kii vaapasi ho gai
 Lalu's efforts began to show color when a large crowd gathered in Patna's May 15 Parivartan rally
 5 june ko unke ummidavaar prabhunath singh ne maharajaganj up-chunaav main nitish sarkaar main mantri pi
 K
 shahi ko 1
 Defeated by 37 lakh votes
 yah lalu kii vaapasi kii disha main bada kadam tha
 Then on June 16, when the BJP-JD (U) alliance was broken, Lalu's return seemed certain and a multi-cornered contest was certain
 iskaa phayda unako hi milane vaala he
 Three years ago, the RJD gave its worst performance in the 2010 assembly elections
 usamen party ko rajya main kul 54
 66 lakh votes i
e
 18
 84 fisadi vot mili
 Yet it is bjp's 16
 46 fisadi voton se zyada the or jedy (you) se sirf 3
 77 percent less
 lalu ko bijepi-jedy (you) gathbandhan tuutane se phayda ho saktaa he
 Lalu's detractors believed that his conviction would weaken his position, but he emerged stronger than before
 sajaa sunaae jane or jamaanat ke baad unhen jaisaa samarthan mila he, usase rajnatik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki 74 din kii jail ne lalu kii vaapasi kii jameen pukhta kii he
 Lalu got sympathy from going to jail
 lekin ve kuch or maah jail main rahete to yah sahanubhuti chintaa or niraashaa kaa rup le leti or rajnatik takaton khaskar bijepi ko lalu ke janaadhar main send lagane kaa mauka mil jaataa
 Lalu was released from jail on bail on time
 lalu ne 2013 main surkhiyaan bhi khub batorin
 At the end of the year, Sonia Gandhi called him and expressed happiness over his release
 ise is sanket ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he ki lalu akele aise netaa hai jo bihar main narendra modi kaa muqabla kar sakate hai
 Now there seems to be a compromise between the Congress and the RJD, which is definitely a cause for concern for Nitish
 soshal media kaa ek chupa hua niyam ye he ki aapako vahi photose daalani he jo aapke kisi dost ne aapse pehle post na kiya ho yaa aisi photo jisamen aap achche lag rahe hon or jisamen zyada like mil sake
 For this, a routine has to be followed, such as editing photos before posting, etc
 ladakiyon main sajane-sanvarne, acchhee photose daalane kii aadat zyada hoti he
 Sometimes girls do not post many photos in their account for various reasons
 aakhirkaar, Facebook par aa saktaa he 'dislike' batan!aise main janm hota he phek acounts kaa jise log un photose ko post karne ke liye banaate hai jise wo apane main acount main post nahin kar pate
 One such place is Finstagram
 ye koi ap nahin he balki instagram ke phek acount ko hi ye naam diya gaya he
 It is quite in trend in the youth circle these days
 Facebook banane ja rahaa he TV, dikhayega khud ke shoshaninstegram logon kaa ek phek acount he jahaan log, khaskar chodi ladkiyaan apni phani or gandi tarah kii photose or video ko post karti hai jise wo apane real instgram acount par apadet nahin kar paatin
 Such accounts are private in which there are very few people who know the person in front
 isamen parivaar waalon kii koi jagah nahin hoti or kabhi-kabhi ladakon ko bhi ijaajat nahin hoti
 Girls put photos and unedited photos hidden from boyfriends
 duusare finstagrammers bhi inke folbers hote hai
 These girls, who call themselves Finestas, post these photos on Finstagram assuming the freedom to post anything
 Jio ko karaara jawaab, vodaphone degaa 345 rupee main 28GB data!ye Finstagram kya he jahaan ladkiyaan apni chhupaae jane vaali photo bhi share kar detii hai

 The leaders of the two parties are seen standing together amid the exercise of the SP-BSP alliance for the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 avaidh khanan maamle ko lekar sibiai akhilesh yadav par shikanja kasne ke mood main dikhi to dard sapa ko hi nahin balki basapa or congress ko bhi hone laga he
 That is why BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra and Congress general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad have stood up in defense of Akhilesh
 sapa-basapa ke itihaas main 1993 ke baad pehali baar he jab sapa ke upar pareshaani ai to basapa dhaal banakar aage saamne ai he
 In the Parliament complex on Monday, SP General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav and bsp's Satish Chandra Mishra attacked the BJP together
 vahiin congress kii ore se gulaami nabi aaazaad bhi akhilesh ke paksh main khadey najar aae or kaha ki modi sarkaar virdohi partiyon ke khilaaf agency ko peeche laga kar daraane or dhamkaane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 Ram Gopal Yadav said that the SP-BSP alliance is not yet done, before that the government has tied up with the CBI parrot
 centre sarkaar ke ishaare par chunaav se pehle CBI kaa durupyog kiya ja rahaa he
 If the Samajwadi Party and their allies come on the road, it will be difficult for the BJP people to walk on the road and Modi will have to leave Benares and contest from another seat
 basapa netaa satish chandra mishra ne akhilesh kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki muddon se bhatakaane ke liye sibiai kaa durupyog kiya ja rahaa he
 bjp's frustration is that the Modi government has tied up with the CBI
 aaj in logon ne sibiai jaisi sanstha ko dharashayi kar diya he
 Congress Rajya Sabha MP Ghulam Nabi Azad also accused the Modi government of misusing the CBI and said that this is not happening for the first time
 aaj nai party ke netaa nishane par hai isse pehle hamaare netaaon ko bhi agency kaa durupyog kar nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 He said that this action has been initiated against Akhilesh Yadav after five and a half years before the election so that the alliance is not formed or the alliance does not lead to victory
 modi sarkaar tiemasi, diemke sahit kai vipakshi dalon ko daraane kaa kaam kar rahi he, jisaki congress party ninda karti he
 The interesting thing is that during the last 23 years, the BSP and the SP have not stood for each other like this
 ye pehali baar he jab ek duusare ke saath aae hai
 The coming of the BSP on the Akhilesh side also has political implications
 gathbandhan kii ghoshnaa se pehle donon partiyon ne sanket de die hai ki ab donon partiyaan ek duusare ke liye sangharsh karne ko taiyaar hai
 This has also sent a message to the party workers of SP-BSP, when the leaders are one, the workers should also be one

 The Supreme Court, in one of its decisions, has limited the right of equalization of daughters in the father's property

 The court held that the amended provision of the Hindu Succession (amendment) Act, 2005 could not have retrospective effect despite being a social legislation
 court ne bataaya ki beti ko sampatti main baraabar kaa hissedaar tabhi mana jayega, jab pita 9 sitambar 2005 ko jivit hon
 Significantly, the Hindu Succession Act of 1956 did not state any legal rights in the father's property for the daughter
 jabaki sanyukt hindu parivaar hone kii sthiti main beti ko jeevika kii maang karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya tha
 Later on 9 September 2005, by bringing amendments in this direction, the daughter was also given equal rights as the son in the father's property

 It is clearly written in section 6 (5) of the law that such earlier partition will be unaffected by the new law
