 kya tirupati mandir main bhagwaan venkateshwar kii puja archana ke dauraan sirf ek khaas nasl kii gaay ke doodh kaa hi istemaal kiya jaataa he? soshal media par kuch log is tarah kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Videos of different cows are being uploaded, claiming that the video belongs to a particular breed of cow Pungnur and the milk of this cow is used in the consecration of Lord Tirupati
 fasebucuger Anita Gupta ne hare hare ghaas ke bich me gumti, ek bhure rang kii gaay kaa video aplod kar likhaa, 'is gaay kii keemat he 12 karod rupee or yah pratidin kareeb 100 litre doodh detii he
 This is the Punganur cow
 keval isi gaay ke doodh se hi tirupati bhagwaan kaa abhishek hota he
 It is considered very auspicious to watch it
 zyada se zyada # share kare taaki ore bhi darshan kar sake
 'people saluted this post with folded hands
 is post kaa archived varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 Similarly some more Facebook users like namo Gunjan uploaded a different video claiming the same
 is video main ek safed rang kii gaay ko sajaayaa ja rahaa he or puja kii ja rahi he
 The archived version of this post can be viewed
 india today ke anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki viral post ke saath kiya ja rahaa daawa bhraamak he
 The Tirupati Temple Trust has a large farm where thousands of different breeds of cows are maintained
 mandir ke kisi bhi kaam me sabhi gaayon ke doodh kaa istemaal hota he
 Tirumala Tirupatu Devasthanam also operates a dairy farm
 is farm ke doirector harnath reddy ne bataaya ki yahaan 3000 se zyaada gaayen hai jinka rakh rakhaav hota he
 Reddy said, 'most of these are our Ongole, Gir and Sahiwal cows
 in sabhi gaayon ke doodh kaa istemaal trust ke sabhi kaamon main hota he
 The milk of all cows is also used for consecration in the temple
 hamaare paas punganur gaay bhi he
 But the cow of this breed is very less now, so work is being done to save them
 ye gaay kuch litre doodh hi detii he lekin hamaara makasad inhen bachaana or inaki seva karnaa he
 When we sent the links to the viral video to Reddy, he told that neither of the two cows is Pungnoor
 reddy ne kaha, 'jo safed gaay he, wo ongole he or bhuri gaay gujarat kii gir gaay he
 'pungnoor cow is short, which is counted among the smallest cows in the world
 padtaal main hamen internet par kuchreportsmilin jiske mutabik punganur nasl kii gaay ko bachaane ke liye kai kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 Although this report notes that ghee is exclusively used only for the consecration of Lord Venkatesh from the milk of this cow, but people associated with the temple have completely denied it
 mandir ke jan sampark adhikari ravi ne kaha, 'farm par maujuud sabhi gaayon ke doodh ko mila kar trust ke sabhi kaamon main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 It is not that only milk of a particular cow breed is used for a particular work
 'lihaaja viral video main dikh rahi gaay punganur nahin he
 Apart from this, only the milk of Punganur cow is used for the consecration of the idol of Lord Venkatesh, this claim is also wrong

 com / x2bzdwq1wo desh main 7172 se zyada railway stesan hai
 12617 trains pass daily from Orun
 in trainon kii saaj-sambhaal karne vaale 13 lakh 10 hajaar karmchaaree or roj us par safar karne vaale kareeb do karod tees lakh yatriyon keliye guuruuvaar kaa din khaas he
 There are many expectations from the new rail budget
 bajet main pehle se kuch alag hone ke kayaas bhi lagaae ja rahe hai
 The way to bring PPP and FDI is expected to be cleared
 jaaniye wo das baaten jo rail bajet main honi chahie-01
 Cleanliness: The most annoying when traveling in trains is seeing dirty toilets and coaches
 bajet main rail kii safai ke liye dhan kaa aavanton badhanaa chahie
 Also, if the bio-toilet (which does not require water) and CCTV cameras are installed in the train, then the situation can be better
 02
 Energy Conservation In the last budget, the Railway Minister had proposed to install solar panels on the train
 agar aisa kiya jaataa he to rail gadiyon kaa eendhan bhi bachegaa
 And Railways will also benefit financially
 piem modi bhi is baat kii pairvi kar chuke hai
 03
 videshi niveshasteshnon, railgadiyon ke rakrakhaav or lambi duuri kii rail gadiyon ko chalaane ke liye videshi niveshkon ko mauka diya janaa chahie
 This will also facilitate the passengers and benefit the Railways
 04
 Bullet train minister had announced to run this train gracefully in the last budget
 lekin jamini str par koi khaas unnati nahin hui
 The case went into cold storage after a trial
 is bajet main bullate train yojana kii samay seemaa or bajet tay kiya janaa chahie
 05
 railway vishvavidylydesh main prastaavit railway vishvavidhyalay ke liye na to abhi tak sthal kaa chayan kiya gaya he or na hi iske shaikshanik or shaskeey dhaanche ko lekar koi faisla hua he
 In this budget, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu should take forward the work by providing funds in this regard
 06
 Chardham Yatra: In the last Railway Budget, Prime Minister Modi announced to connect the Char Dham Yatra with the rail route
 uske liye surveykshan shuru karne kii baat bhi hui thi
 But no concrete action has yet been taken to build the rail network up to Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri
 is bajet main railmantri ko is yatra ko sugam banane kii koshish kerani chahie
 07
 khaali pade padon par bharteepichley rail bajet main sarkaar ne khaali pade padon par bhartee kii baat kahi thi
 Along with 17 thousand soldiers in Railway Protection Force (RPF), announced the recruitment of four thousand additional women security personnel
 lekin ghoshnaa ke mutabik koi khaas kaam nahin hua
 There is a need to fill the vacant posts in this budget
 isse kai berozegaron ko kaam bhi milegaa
 08
 airport kii tarj par stationpichley bajet main tatkaaleen railmantri gauda ne desh ke das bade steshnon ko airport kii tarj par viksit kiye jane kaa elaan kiya tha
 But nothing special happened on that project
 is bajet main ummid kii ja sakati he ki railmabhi prabhu is yojana ko amal main laaenge
 09
 takkar rodhi pranalidesh main viksit rail takkar rodhi pranali kii shuruyaat konkan se kii gai thi
 But the work did not start despite the announcement of the system being used in many places including North India
 rail mantri ko is mahatvapurn yojana par dhyaan dena chahie
 This system is effective in preventing rail accidents
 10
 Improvement in reservation system: With the budget of rail, passengers expect that the government will make the reservation system easy and transparent
 lekin ghoshnaaon ke baavjood naa to dallalon ke jaal se mukti milti he or naa hi lambii kataron or pratiksha suchi se
 In this budget, the public is expected from the Railway Minister that they will take concrete steps to improve the reservation policy
 goa main 45wein antarrashtriya bhartiya film mahotsav ke uddhatan samaaroh main goa ke purv mukhyamantri or kendriya raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne ek badi gadabad kar di
 Parrikar was, in fact, thanking the dignitaries who were present at the inauguration ceremony
 isamen vah dakshin ke superstararajnikantka naam lenaa bhul gaye
 Parrikar thanked the Information and Broadcasting Minister Arun Jaitley, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar and State Governor Mridula Sinha at the inauguration ceremony but forgot to name Rajinikanth
 parrikar ne haalanki turant apni galati ko muskuraate hue sweekaar kiya
 Addressing Rajinikanth with a shy smile, Parrikar said, 'i'm sorry for the mess
 maine naam likhe the (samaaroh main maujuud ganmaanyon ke), lekin us kaagaj ko main neeche hi bhul aayaa
 For his angry temper on the screen, the famous smiling warmly in response to the famous Janjikanth's response made the atmosphere happy again
 - inputaniansh With the death of four tigers in just 45 days, Madhya Pradesh's efforts to regain the status of "tiger state" in the country may be in trouble
 aprakritik kaarnon se taaja mauton ke saath 2017 main marane vaale baaghon kii sankhya 25 tak pahunch chuki he jo nishchit rup se chintaa kaa vishay he
 Of these, 15 tigers died in the forests and surrounding areas of Bandhavgarh National Park
 taaja ghatana 11 disambar kii he jisamen ek vayask baghin ko umariya jile ke kachodar ke paas mara hua paaya gaya tha
 a day later, one of his cubs was found and he too died due to the current in the trap laid by the poachers
 maut ke teen din baad donon shavon kaa milanaa sambandhit adhikariyon ke laaparvaahee bhare ravaie kii taraf ishaara karata he—bandhavgarh main baaghon par najar rakhane ke liye jimmedaar vanyajeev adhikariyon ko in mauton kii bhanak tak nahin lagi thi
 There were two similar incidents in November in which a tiger was found dead near Shahdol due to poisoning, while another tiger was found dead at Dhorai in Umaria district
 baaghon kii ''aprakritik" mauton main ai achaanak teji se harakat main aae rashtriya baagh sangrakshan praadhikaran (antisie) ne madhya pradesh van vibhaag ko notice bhejkar jawaab maanga he
 Although the state officials have not given any response yet, this has started a well-known game of accusation in the state
 ek varisht van adhikari apana naam gupt rakhane kii shart par kehete hai ki maanak sanchaalan prakriyaayein (esaopi) nahin apanaai ja rahi hai
 "once we find out that there is a tiger in the area, patrolling should be increased to detect the trap of electric wires, especially in areas which are notorious for such crimes," he says
 " unke mutabik, sthaneey logon ko is bare main jaagruk karne kii koi vyavastha nahin he kyonki prashikshit vanyajeev adhikariyon kii kaaphi kami he
 "they are appointed either at headquarters or outside the forest department," he said
 "vanyajeev kaaryakarta ajay dube bhi karmchaariyon kii kami kii taraf ishaara karte hai, kyonki nichle str ke karmchaaree baagh abhayaaranyon main viypi duty main lage hote hai
 Dubey rejects the reply of forest officials that the snare was not set up to trap tigers
 ve kehete hai, ''yah bhi koi jawaab he? bas kisi sthaneey vyakti ko giraftaar kar liya jaataa he, jo hameshaa koi adivasee hota he
 But there is no reduction in such incidents
 "varsh 2006 tak madhya pradesh main 300 baagh the jo desh main kisi bhi rajya ke mukaable sabase zyada sankhya thi
 But as the tiger deaths increased, it lost its place
 isaki jagah karnataka or uttarakhand ne le lee
 Starting a campaign to increase the tiger population again, Madhya Pradesh wanted to regain its status after the National Wildlife Census in 2018
 lekin uske liye avaidh shikaar par lagaam lagaana pehla kadam hona chahie
 Dhawanjeev activist Ajay Dubey points out the staff shortage
 nichle str ke karmchaaree baagh abhayaaranyon main viypi duty main lage hote hai

 Fog and cold wave in North India including Delhi has made people living

 In the debates about the rise of the area of influence of the Naxalites, it repeatedly comes to light that why the government would not have pushed the security forces and drove them away
 unke thikaane, network or prabhaav ko dhwast kar detii he
 To correct this debate, let us first understand some figures
 alag-alag rajyon kii police ke alaava is vakt naksalwadiyon ke khilaaf puure desh main chal rahe oparation main para military ke 82 hajaar jawan tainaat hai
 It also includes forces ranging from CRPF and RAF to ITBP
 iske alaava cobra jaise vishesh bal bhi hai, jo gorilla warfere ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 On the same lines, there are also the Greyhounds force of Andhra Pradesh, due to their aggressive strategy, the Maoists have suffered continuously in Andhra Pradesh

 In such a situation there is no permanent effect

 The vacuum created after the movement reaches to fill the red terror
 aise main unhen ek baargi har jagah se ukhaadne ke liye kam se kam 27 hajaar javaanon kii auki jarurat padegi
 Even after completing these numbers, it will take two years to clean the three major Naxalite centers, Bastar in Chhattisgarh, malkangiri-koraput in Odisha and Latehar area in Jharkhand

 com / rva0p95wea bhartiya hockey or coach terry walsh ke rishte kaa anjaam aisa hoga, ye kisi ne pehle shaayad hi sochaa ho
 Indian hockey coach Terry Walsh went to the Sports Ministry and shook hands with the Sports Minister in front of the media, but they all have got their hearts also, it cannot be said at all
 khel mantri se milane ke baad bhi walsh team ke coach bane rahenge yaa nahin ye khud coach ko bhi nahin maaloom
 Coach Walsh said that becoming one of the coaches of Indian hockey is one of his most difficult tasks
 unhone kaha ki vah bhartiya hockey ke saath kaam karnaa chaahate hai, lekin unke mutabik nae qaraar main unki sharten maani jaaengi, tabhi vah is team ke saath kaam kar sakenge
 At the same time, Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said that Indian hockey needs coach Walsh, because the Indian team has achieved great success with Walsh
 lekin walsh kii kai sharten hai, jinamein ek ye he ki vah perth main rahakar bhi bhartiya team kii koching karnaa chaahate hai
 He has also demanded an increase in his salary based on past performance
 lekin hockey india ke adhyaksh narendra batra ne terry walsh or america hockey ke bich saftware ko lekar hue qaraar kaa hawala dete hue walsh ke charitra par sawaal uthaa die
 Walsh reacted shocked and sad that no one was going to benefit from it and refused to talk about it in the media further
 haal ke dinon main asiad, kaamanwealth khel or australia main bhartiya hockey ne kai badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 These victory pictures of Indian hockey will soon be erased by the fans, for this the officials are playing well outside the field
 agle maheene kii chah taarikh se bhartiya team hockey ke sabase mushkil toornament champiens trophy main hissaa legi
 In this tournament, the Indian team has managed to make it to the podium only once
 lekin haal kii kamyaabi ke baad team ke upakptain piaar srijesh kehete hai ki australia main jeet ke baad khilaadiyon kaa aatmavishvaas badha he or unhen ummid he ki team is toornament main bhi acha pradasharn karegi
 The Indian hockey team's goalkeeper vice-captain says that the recent success of the Indian team is very encouraging
 unhone kaha ki He dreams of taking the Champions Trophy in hand
 unhen bharosa he ki team ko is baar gharelu maidan main match khilne kaa faaydaa bhi milegaa or is baar team acha pradarshan karegi
 In fact, after the Asian Games, the issue was raised by Hockey India about the payment of tax by hockey coach Terry Walsh
 hockey coach walsh ne us vakt apane istife kii peshkash kar di or media main ise lekar khub bavaal uthaa
 Terry Walsh took advantage of this opportunity and raised several issues of his salary and hockey support staff and work together
 inamen se kai mudde aaj bhi barqaraar hai
 Committee of veterans like former captain Ajit Pal Singh, Zafar Iqbal and Ashok Kumar to resolve this issue banaai gai, lekin lambii baithkon ke baad ye cameti masale kaa hal nikaalane main naakaam rahi
 This hockey story is not new
 bhartiya team jab bhi badi kaamanyabi hasil karti he, adhikari maidan ke baahar is kamyaabi ko bada nahin banane dete
 Once again Indian hockey stands on the same footing
 zaahir he hockey kaa khel maidan ke baahar itani tezi se ho rahaa he ki samajhnaa mushkil ho gaya he ki goalpost kis taraf he
 At the moment, it can be said that the hockey team will have to work hard to save goals in the Champions Trophy
 yadi aap avivaahit yuva hai to aapke paas vivaah karne kaa saahas na kar paane ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai
 One of these is the fear of going into depression

 gujarat main patel samudaay ke yuva netaa hardik patel ke ensipi main jane kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 NCP leader Praful Patel visited Hardik today
 haalanki hardik kaa kahana he ki deepawali ke baad gujaratiyon kaa nayaa saal hota he
 This meeting was just to wish the new year
 chunaav se iskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Particular meaning of meeting in electoral atmosphere: Hardik Patel may be asking not to see this meeting through electoral spectacles, but due to the time in which this meeting is taking place, it is special in many ways
 do saal pehlepatidaar samaajake yuva netaa banakar ubhare hardik patel ke liye gujarat main chunaav behad mahatvapurn hai
 Till November 7, the Congress has given the ultimatum till a few days ago, it seemed that Hardik would hold the hand of the Congress, but at the last moment he gave the ultimatum to the Congress
 unhone patidaar samaaj ko kota dene ke maamle main congress ko pehle 3 november tak kii mohalat di
 They later said that they would wait until 7 November
 congress ne ab tak is par chuppi saadh lee he
 This is believed to have killed the ax on his own
 congress ke haath khinch lene ke baad hardik ke paas chunaav main zyada vikalp bache nahin he
 Actually, this ultimatum has increased his distance from Congress
 survey main bhi hardik kaa nahin dikhaa tha jaadoogujrat main chunaav se thik pehle india today group or AXIS MY INDIA ne milakar ek survey kiya tha
 In the survey, people were of the opinion that the Congress will not get any benefit even if it is with Hardik Patel
 isse na to unka vot share badhegaa or na hi seat kaa phayda hoga
 When Hardik contested the elections alone, his account did not appear in the 182-seat Assembly
 2015 main reliyon se achaanak ubhare the hardiksaal 2015 main patidaar samaaj ke yuvaaon ko apane saath jodakar bade yuva netaa ke rup main ubhare hardik patel ne beete do saal main gujarat kii raajnneeti main acha-khaasaa dakhal diya he
 The Hardik rally held in 2015 had put many politicians to sleep
 bade netaaon kii uda di thi neenthhardik patel ne 2015 main gujarat main kai badi reliyaan kii thim
 These rallies put the government of the state under pressure
 nai party bananaa bhi mushkilgar rahul gandhi ne patidaar samaaj ko aarakshan dilaane kaa vaada nahin kiya to yah sabase zyada hardik patel ke liye mushkil kaa sabab ho saktaa he
 Hardik Patel has no chance of supporting the BJP
 hardik ke ultimatum par agar rahul koi jawaab nahin dete hai to unke paas third front ke alaava koi or vikalp nahin bachataa
 Now there is not much time left in the Gujarat elections, in such a situation, Hardik cannot even form a new party
 ab agar hardik chunaav se duuri banaate hai to patidaar netaa ke rup main unke vajood par bhi sawalia nishaan lag jayega

 *** kala or lakshmi main hameshaa se tedha rishta rahaa he
 This tension has increased even more due to the huge budget and numerous media platforms to announce the film
 aaj ke apane jamaane main film nirmaataa or manoranjan parosane vaale ke taur par maine mahasoos kiya he ki film kii marketing is puri prakriya kaa abhinn ang ban gai he
 For this, it is necessary to have an adequate budget, a media plan has to be prepared that how to promote the film extensively
 isse aise bhi log jude hote hai, jo film ke reeli
 People who want financial benefits after they become, who have invested a lot of money on the success of the film
 isamen rachanaatmak prakriya ke saath marketing kii suniyojit yojana judi hoti he
 But as a director, the motive behind the promotion of the film is that the right people know about your film, to catch the attention of the people you want to impress with your work
 darshakon ko khinchne ke kaarobaar ne bhi cinema ko bahut kuch badal diya he or upabhokta darshak ko yah jaankaree dena jaruri he ki aap use kya dikhaane ja rahe hai
 To that extent marketing is an essential part of filmmaking
 kisi nirdeshak ke liye film kii kahani hi sabase acha prachaar he
 He does not allow the business side of the film to dominate so much that it has to be compromised from the artistic side
 film kii marketing usee bindu tak jaruri he, jahaan isamen paisa lagane vaale logon ko yakeen ho sake ki unhen apane kharch kaa vaazib munafa mil jayega, kyonki film ke nirmaan kii tarah use dekhne kaa kharch bhi kai guna bad gaya he
 The viewer needs to know about the essence of the film
 maine nijee taur par apni filmon ke prachaar ke aarthik paksh or film banane ke apane tareeke ke bich kisi tarah ke takaraav kaa anubhav kabhi bhi nahin kiya, kyonki main ab bhi film kii kahani ko tarjeeh detaa hum
 My approach is clear: first let the film be made, then decide how to promote it
 kisi film kii marketing kaa sabase acha tarika yah he ki acchhee film banaai jaae or aap paaenge ki film nirmaan kii prakriya marketing se kahin zyada behatar he
 Even in the promotion of the film Rockstar, we did not give any interview until we were fully convinced about the strength of the film
 main donon hi prakriyaaon ko alag-alag rakhane main pakkaa yakeen karata hum
 My job as a director is to make a good film
 nirdeshak ko film nirmaan ke vibhinn pahaluon ko dekhnaa hota he
 But i also realize that media has a great influence on this process
 film kii marketing kii nai ranneeti kaa sabase mjedaar hissaa yah he ki yojanakaar darshak tak pahunchane ke liye nae raste nikaal rahe hai
 And on the other hand, the audience is leading filmmakers to the areas they want to know
 bhartiya film darshakon main sabase bada badlaav yah aayaa he ki ve hi film kaa nirmaan tay kar rahe hai, us tarah kii film, jinhen ve dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, in the promotion of the film, it has to be kept in mind that the audience has become more knowledgeable than before
 apni film ke prachaar main ek nirdeshak ke taur par meri jo bhoomika hoti thi, ab vah pehle se kahin zyada bad gai he
 My first release
 ja hone vaali film, sochaa na tha, ke samay maine kai intervyuu die, lekin meraa kaam bas itnaa hi tha
 We are part of an industry whose fate is the film's release
 ja ke pehle hi hafte tak simit hoti he
 By that criteria, the thought was not a flop
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki film ko apni reeli
 No matter how much publicity is received before J, if it is a good film, it is liked and always draws the audience, which it is made keeping in mind
 hindi film darshakon parandaaj apana apana jaisi film ke padane vaale prabhaav se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa lekin kaarobaar ke nazariye se yah ladkadaa gai
 The benefit of marketing is limited to the initial sales of the film, it cannot decide the future of the film in the eyes of the audience
 nirdeshak ko vahi karnaa chahie jo uske swabhaav se mail khaataa ho or use film kii safalataa ko sunishchit karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie, na ki us manch par jaakar use nuksaan pahunchaana chahie, jahaan vah asahaj mahasoos karata ho
 According to me, promoting the film without being uncomfortable, only hurts him
 yah asahajata aapaki udaseenta darshaati he, jisase turant hi darshakon kaa film ke saath naata tut jaataa he
 i know that there are many platforms for the promotion of a film, for example a dance show, for which Ranbir Kapoor would fit perfectly
 main dance sho ke khilaaf nahin hum, lekin main usamen asahaj mahasoos karuunga

 sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhir RJD ne bihar band kyon kiya, jabaki bihar sarkaar ne band se ek din pehle hi jis nai khanan niti kaa RJD virodh kar rahi thi, use waapas le liya he
 Why the need for a shutdown in such a situation? So that we can shine our politics? Due to this opposition from RJD, a woman lost her life

 Rama says that i may never be able to get up from bed because my bones have also become old with age and the doctors also fear that they might not be able to get up
 aise main ek bada sawaal ye bhi he road sefti ke liye kya sirf kadaa kanoon hi kaaphi he yaa phir badlaav soch main bhi honi chahie
 Under this, a new section 304 (A) (2) will be added to the Indian Penal Code and there will be a minimum sentence of 2 years and maximum of 7 years in the hit and run case
 nashe main gaadi chalaane ke maamle main bhi yahi dharaaen lagu hongi
 Currently, there is a maximum sentence of two years in such cases

 The comments nae kanoon ke daayre main laaparvaahee se gaadi chalaane ke dauraan kisi ke jakhmi hone yaa maut kii haalat main faraar hone ke maamle bhi aaenge
 But the question is that this is enough to make life safe on the road

 kya aap bhi munhaason se pareshaan hai? aaj ke samay main ye ek aam samasya he
 Disorganized lifestyle and pollution are the main causes of acne
 munhaason ko hone se rokane ke liye jaruri he ki cheharaa saaf-suthra rahe or aahaar paushtik
 According to Madhu Arora, the mistress of Delhi's 'blush Clinic' franchise, pimples can be prevented by following these suggestions: 1
 munhaase-rodhi khoobiyon vaale saundarya utpaadon kaa istemaal karen
 Apply a toner after washing the facewash with the gel and then apply a moisturizer with the gel
 2
 Not taking care of cleanliness during monsoon can lead to acne
 isse bachane ke liye sahi dhang se cleansing, moshcharising or toning karen
 Do not touch the face with dirty hands
 3
 You also have to pay attention to your diet
 monsoon main junk food se parhez karen
 Oily food and soft drinks make the skin oily
 swasth twachaa ke liye kam se kam teen litre pani pien
 In the morning, first drink a lemon squeezed in a glass of lukewarm water
 aahaar main taaja fal-sabji, salad, ankurit anaaj or dahi shaamil karen
 4
 agar aapaki twachaa taileey he, to cleansing ke baad astrigent kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 Apply an astringent on the cotton wool and clean the face with it
 astrigent kaa prayog aamtaur parchehre se dhul-gard or tel hataaneke liye hota he
 5
 blakeaids se bachane se munhaase se bachane main madad milti he
 If you have blackheads, use a scrub at that place
 munhaase vaali jagah par scrub na lagaaein
 This increases it further
 akasar bahut se kapal mahaj aupchaarikta yaa akelepan ke dar se niras relationships kaa boj bhi dhote rahete hai

 There has often been a chaos in the underworld in Mumbai, but other cities have not escaped the shadow of crime
 aisa hi ek shahar he gujarat kaa ahmedabad
 To say that this city is very prosperous but underworld gangsters have also ruled this city
 unhi main se ek purana naam aaj kal surkhiyon main chaaya hua he
 Because the life of that gangster is based on superstar Shah Rukh Khan's next film Raees
 or ahmedabad ke us don kaa naam tha abdul latif
 He was also called the King of Gujarat
 koun tha abdul latifbdul latif ahmedabad ke dariyapur ilaake main rahaa karata tha
 He was born there
 parivaar kii mali haalat thik nahin thi
 The family was large, so everyone in the house used to work
 mushkil halaat or aarthik kamajori ne abdul latif ko zyada padhane kaa mauka nahin diya
 At an early age, Abdul had to work for bread on 2 June
 or kachi umr main hi wo ek aise raste par chal padaa jo maut ke paas jaakar khatm hota tha
 First step in the world of crime Abdul Latif started working at a very young age
 80 ke dashak main usne kaloopur overbrij ke paas deshi sharaab bechney kii shuruyaat kar di
 It was from here that he took the first step in the world of goryam
 dhire-dhire usne angreji sharaab bhi bechni shuru kar di
 He was earning well from this work
 iske baad latif ne shahar ke kot ilaake main rahane vaale badmaashon ko apni gang main shaamil kiya or phir hathiyaar supplai karne vaale sharif khan se haath mila liya
 In this way Latif was smuggling liquor as well as arms
 gujarat par rajajavani kii dahalij paar karne ke saath hi kuch hi varshon main latif gangster ban chukaa tha, lekin kisi bhi gangvaar main vah khud kabhi saamne nahin rahaa
 Latif, in a very vicious manner, got divided into several small gangs and joined them in his gang
 is tarah ahmedabad ke baad uskaa dabadabaa puure gujarat main fail gaya
 Latif had made the network of illicit liquor in Gujarat so strong that no butlegger, ie illicit liquor seller, could sell liquor without his will
 garibon kaa maseehaa tha latifshahar ke muslim ilaakon main latif garibon ke liye maseehaa mana jane laga tha
 He used to join unemployed youth in his gang
 isaki vajah se use raajnneetik samarthan bhi milane laga tha
 In 1985, he contested five seats in the body elections while jailed
 or vah jail main rahete hue bhi sabhi siton par chunaav jeet gaya tha
 Which was a record in itself
 uski is jeet se bade bade netaaon ne daanton tale ungali dabaa lee thi
 Gang-up, then befriended Dawood, meanwhile, underworld don Dawood Ibrahim had also set up a drug network in Vadodara, Gujarat
 isi dauraan ek baar daaud or latif ke bich gangvaar chhid gai
 Latif's henchmen surrounded Dawood and Dawood had to flee from Vadodara
 lekin baad main is tarah kii khabaren ai thi ki daaud or latif ke bich dosti ho gai thi
 This was the reason that Abdul Latif's name also came up in the Mumbai serial blast case
 latif ke khilaaf darj hai kareeb 80 maamlibdul latif gujarat main 40 se bhi adhik hatya ke maamalon main aaropee tha
 While his name is involved in almost the same number of cases of kidnapping
 latif ko 1995 main dilli se giraftaar kiya gaya
 After this he was kept in Sabarmati Jail Ahmedabad
 november 1997 main abdul latif ne ek baar bhaagane kii koshish kii, jis dauraan gujarat police se encounter main vah maaraa gaya
 The film and controversy over the life of a gangster has been served by a court in Ahmedabad on a petition by the son of Abdul Latif, a Gujarati gangster, to the production house of Shah Rukh
 yah film latif kii jindagi par hi aadhaarit he
 Latif's son Mushtaq Ahmed Sheikh said in his petition that Shah Rukh Khan's film was tarnishing his father's name
 yahi nahin, unhone is babat harjane kii maang karte hue 101 karod rupee kii manahani kaa daawa kiya he
 Mushtaq has also demanded a moratorium on the release of the film and the release of the promotional material
 unka kahana he ki film ke duusare hisse main latif ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya he
 'raees' also stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Mahira Khan in the lead role besides Shah Rukh Khan
 'ham izzatdaar jindagi basar kar rahe hai'mushtak kehete hai, 'mere pita abdul latif ko mare kai saal ho chuke hai
 Today our family is living a good and dignified life in the society
 aise main ek baar phir log mere pita latif kii puraani jindagi ke bare main baat karne lage hai
 We are facing problems in this society
 itane saal biit chuke hai
 Today i am a builder
 mere bachche achche skool main padhate hai
 What is the need to film them? 'gangster latif se lenaa dena nahindusri ore, latif ki jindagi se judi is film ke bare main jab mushtak ke jarie film ke nirdeshak rahul dholkia se baat ki gai, to unhone kaha ki 'rais' kaa latif kii jindagi se koi lenaa-dena nahin he

 a family in Alwar district of Rajasthan named their newborn baby after the Wing Commander Abhinandan of the Indian Navy
 is shishu kaa janm 1 marchako us samay hua jab wing commander abhinandan (abhinandan Varthaman) ko pakistan chhodane vaala tha
 The child's grandfather Janesh Bhutani told, "my daughter-in-law gave birth to a son on Friday evening
" hamane vayusena ke payalat ke sammaan main uskaa naam bhi abhinandan (abhinandan) rakhaa he
 We are proud of Pilot Abhinandan, so we have named this new guest in the family Abhinandan
 ''unhone kaha ki unki putravadhu sahit puraa parivaar kai dinon se is ghatnakram ko tivi par dekh rahaa tha
 At the same time, Prasuta Sapna Devi said, "through the name Abhinandan, i will remind my son of the courage of our Jabanjh Pilot
 main chaahuungi ki meraa betaa bhi bada hokar usee kii tarah bahadur sainik bane
 The family lives in Kishangarh Bas in Alwar
 ullekhneey he ki mig 21 (mig 21) uda rahe wing commander abhinandan kaa vimaan buudhvaar (27 farvari) ko niyantran rekha ke duusari ore gira tha or parachute se kudane par pakistani sena (pakistani Army) ne unhen pakad liya tha
 He returned to India on Friday (1 March)
 isse pehle buudhvaar(27 farvari) ko nagaur ke ek parivaar ne apane navjaat shishu kaa naam miraj rakhaa
 Mirage is an Indian Air Force aircraft used for attacks on terrorist targets across the Line of Control
 isse prerana lekar dabda gaanv kii dampatti ne apane bete kaa naam 'miraj singh rathod' (mirage Singh Rathore) rakhaa he
 The pressure of all media has been adapted in our minds that now children's literature has become a thing of the past
 ab to bachche bhi smart hai jo internet par gyaan kii saamagree khud khoj lete hai or bahut hua to skulon kii librariyaan mahangi-sundar angreji kitaaben de detii hai
 In the midst of this alleged reality, one should try to see what exactly is the status of children's literature in Hindi? It is true that time does not stop and things change constantly
 saath or sattar ke dashak vaala paraag to kya ab assi-nabbe ke dashak vaala nandan bhi vaisaa nahin rahaa lekin bahut kuch nayaa or sukhad bhi hua he jis par hamaara dhyaan nahin gaya
 Seeing this new is also a test of preparation for the new generation in our language and culture, because we will be able to hope that children will also become readers of the great literature of our language after interest is created here
 bacchon ke sahitya ke liye kaam kaam rahi sansthaaon rashtriya pustak nyaas (enbiti) or eklavya ke saath ab takshashila ne bhi lagaataar sundar-stareey prakashnon se is jameen ko urvar banaaya he
 Children's magazines have changed and new magazines have also come out
 2019 ke shuru main dilli main lage vishwa pustak meley main is baar eklavya, enbiti ke saath takshashila ke stall par bacchon kaa jamghat tha
 a new magazine Cycle has been started from here which will be considered as Apoorva in Hindi
 bacchon kii is dumahia patrika main susheel shukla ke sampadan main jaisi gunvatttapurna moulik saamagree chhapi he vah hamaari bhashaa main kabhi-kabhaar dekhne ko milti he
 Without tagging science magazine, this magazine full of socio-cultural and logical material is for scientific approach
 is patrika ke praveshank ke lekhakon main se kuch naam the—vinod kumaar shukla, asagar vajahat, arun camel, anamika, krishna kumaar, priyanvad, chitrakaar akhilesh, udayan vaajapeyi, irshaad kamil, krishna baldev vaid, naresh saxena, rajesh joshi, vishnu nagar, ashok bhaumik or mangalesh dabraal
 Tales, stories, memoirs, travelogues, poems and cycle marks made up of a large number of readable material are constantly coming up and this magazine has successfully tried to remove the old distinction of Hindi literature where it was believed that children and elders were Literatureists who write for it vary
 susheel shukla ke sampadan main ek or patrika nikaali ja rahi he pluto
 It is intended for younger children, in which the visuals are more impressive
 yah dekhnaa sukhad he ki in patrikaon ke madhyam se shukla hindi main bal sahitya kii sarvadha nae dhang kii kitaaben chhapane kaa rasta bhi taiyaar karte hai
 The Taxila Education Society, which publishes Cycles and Pluto, has also published several books and posters along with these journals, the first thing to be said in relation to which is that they have been prepared with deep aesthetics and taste
 duusari baat he is samooche bal sahitya kaa uddeshy shikshaprad sahitya kaa utpaadan nahin he kyonki bado kaa sahitya bhi kisi sikh ke liye nahin hota apitu yah sahitya isliye shreshth ban gaya he ki iskaa uddeshy suruchi, kautuhal, saundaryabodh or jigyaasa utpann karnaa he
 The great success of Jugnu Prakashan is also in the fact that it has prepared the best writers of Hindi to write for children
 in logon main swayan prakaash, vajahat, vinod kumaar shukla, priyanvad jaise jane-maane lekhak hai to videshi shreshth bal sahitya kaa anuwaad bhi in pustakon main shaamil he
 In this sequence, what should i know about the book of small stories (or dialogues) of Wajahat? Himself Prakash's Hazi Nazi and Sappu's friend, Priyamvand's clay cart, Sunita's Peacock Dungri, Dr
 Nagesh Pandey's bust on Sanjay's back, Virender Dubey's four gourd, Shyam Sushil's goat with Proiti Roy's Jab i Moti Bringing home is prominent
 videshi anuwaad kii pustakon main maninnja musil kii kissu hathi (slovakia), nahid kazmi kii wo naarangi ghar, ahamed raja ahmadi kii phir milenge or babak sabari kii ek bada acha dost (teenon iran kii) ko dekhnaa khaasaa samrudh karne vaala anubhav he
 Similarly, small selections of children's poems are printed under the title Ant Chadhi Pahad and Chand Roti
 ek vrihadaakaar kitaab binnsu kaa bhi prakaashan yahaan se hua he jise madhubani style kii chitrakatha ke rup main badi sies ke lagbhag sava sau prishthon main chapa gaya he
 It is the story of a twelve-year-old Bixu studying in a boarding school with a beautiful combination of new world and life experiences along with memories of home
 upar ai zyaadaatar kitabon ko is bhavbhumi par nirmit kiya gaya he ki ve bacchon ko shiksha yaa upadesh dene vaali pothiyon ke sthaan par nanhen nagarikon se samvaad karne vaali or unhen bade sawaalon ke liye taiyaar karne vaali rochak kitaaben bane
 In Sappu's friend, Prakash himself has stories of watching the reality of life with special nostalgia, and Vajahat in his question-and-answer style creates such stories that children are seen cutting their ears
 kya inhen jawaab nahin milane chahie? inhen sawaalon ke jawaab kii talash main swayan prakaash kii choti-si kitaab hanji naaji rachi gai he jo kabhi latifon kaa majaa detii he to kabhi tikhe sawaalon se jhunjhalaahat paidaa karti he
 This is the thing that makes these books different and meaningful from the Hindi children's literature of the genre
 vastut: kahana chahie ki susheel shukla kii sampadan drushti or takshashila ke prayogon ne hindi sahitya ke ab tak chale aa rahe us vibhaajan ko khatm kiya he jiske antargat bacchon ke liye khaas bal sahityakar hi likhte the or jinhen tathakthith mukhya dhara kaa lekhak mana jaataa he, ve is taraf dekhne se bhi hichakate the
 Needless to say how much this division has done
 in nai kitabon main dhyaan dene yogya ek nai kitaab sunita kii he
 In his book More Dungri, the painter-narrator Sunita tells her story with the tribal art of Rajasthani surroundings, which makes women sensitive to questions like gender even without the discourse of female discourse
 shyaam susheel ekadam chote bacchon ke liye kavita rachate hai: bakrii kaan hilaae, munni gaanaa gaae
 Similarly, Proiti Roy narrates the story of Moti's dog Moti
 prakruti or jeev jagat se bacchon ke aakarshan kii yah choti-si kitaab bado ko bhi bhigo sakati he
 Along with these books, Jugnu Prakashan has also published some books which are for teenagers
 in sabhi kitabon main antarvastu ke saath chitron par gaharaa parishram kiya gaya he
 Able painters such as Atanu Roy, Alan Shaw, Bhargava Kulkarni, Devabrata Ghosh, Nabarina Singh, Proiti Roy, Taposhi Ghoshal have done a brilliant job of capturing these stories, creations on the minds of readers and with the author on the cover of the books Credit is also received
 rashtriya pustak nyaas bharat sarkaar kaa vah swytt upkram he jo nunatam keemat main bacchon kaa sahitya uplabdh karwaata he
 Some good books have come from here recently
 masalan tripurari sharma kii alu, vinayak kii jinda ajaayabaghar, premaswaroop shrivastav kii ek tamaasha aisa bhi, suresh yadav kii neeli nadi kaa sunaharaa pathar, neelam saxena chandra kii kasam matamaile mashroom kii, sarvend vikram kii sabji mandi tathaa kshamaa sharma or devendra kumaar kii chuninda bal kahaniyaan
 The most interesting is the Alu of Tripurari Sharma which is produced from the stories of a child of an owl
 kalpanashiltaa isi ko kehete hai ki ham bacchon ko asambhav maaloom hota bhi dekhne ke liye utsuk banaaen
 Allu's life and struggle have come alive with the pen of Irshad captain and the pen of Tripurari Sharma so that the eyes and the mind remain stuck in the book
 chandra kii kasam matamaile mashroom kii or sarvendra vikram kii sabji mandi nanhen pathakon ko yatharth jivan ke adrishy pakshon main le jaati hai
 Don't know why, the Trust has now removed the insignia of 'nehru Bal Library' from its nearly fifty-year-old book series in which a rose flower reminiscent of Nehru used to be in a corner above the book
 khayr
 In the language where the enthusiasm to make such beautiful books is seen, to say that children do not read books, is actually our failure and it is produced by not having access to such books, experiments
 nyaas kii kitaaben ab adhik aasaani se uplabdh hai to internet ke sulabh hone se in sabhi kitabon ko online bhi kharida ja saktaa he
 Yes, it can also be complained that the prices of these magazines and books are not very reasonable, even then it will not be so difficult to buy these books, eradicating the barrenness of optionlessness
 koshish honi chahie ki bachche apni bhashaa ke sahitya ko padhein or jaane tabhi ve shaayad kabhi apni bhashaa or samskruti se prem bhi karne lagen

 Meanwhile, the Delhi government has spoken of helping the Bihar government
 dilli ke up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne kaha he ki bihar kii sarkaar ko dilli sarkaar har sambhav madad karne ko taiyaar he
 On the other hand, Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain says that the incidents happening in Bihar can be covered in Ayushman India
 lekin unako ilaaj kyon nahin mil rahaa he
 Explain that Ayushman Yojana is the world's largest scheme for giving health insurance up to Rs 5 lakh to more than 50 crore people

 But when these incidents started happening, Anganwadi servants came to tell them about the prevention of this disease
 bataa den ki is agency ke sadasyon ko march main bharat main aane ke liye vija nahin diya gaya tha
 Then it was said on behalf of the Government of India that there is no need for any such organization in the country

 ) america raashtrapati donald trump ne guuruuvaar raat ko desh ko sambodhit kiya
 The border issue was overshadowed in his address, which he insisted on resolving together
 raashtrapati trump ne america-mexico border kii haalat ko 'dinon din badhata' sankat bataaya or aasapaas ke deshon kaa is ore dhyaan khinchaa
 President Trump had 5 to resolve this issue and build a steel wall on the Mexico border
 7 arab dollar kii maang kii
 The President addressed the nation for the first time from the Oval Office and appealed to the people to come forward to solve the border problem
 unhone guuruuvaar raat tivi par die apane sambodhan main democrates kaa dhyaan is ore khinchaa or ise insaani or logon ke dilo-dimag kaa bada sankat qaraar diya
 At the same time, Trump insisted on funding as soon as possible for the safety and well-being of the people
 america raashtrapatine democrates se khaas apil kii or unase white house main milane kaa aagrah kiya
 He even went so far as to say that nothing can be more immoral than the leaders of the country
 ' gauratlab he kitrumpajab se satta main aae hai, unka avaidh pravaasiyon ke khilaaf zyada jor rahaa he
 They have vowed many times to stop it
 trump kaa maananaa he kimexicoborder paar se aane vaale pravaasiyon ko rokane ke liye steel kii diwaar banaai jaani chahie lekin diwaar kaa kharch zyada hone ke kaaran ve isamen sabaki bhagidaari sunishchit karnaa chaahate hai
 For this, he has also proposed to cut the country's spending
 haalanki aalochak trump kii in baton se sahamat nahin hai or ve maanate hai ki suraksha kaa mudda badha-chadha kar pesh kiya ja rahaa he or ise insaaniyat ke naam par parosa ja rahaa he
 In America, this issue is also hot because Trump wants to declare the border problem as a national emergency and build a wall but till last night he did not make any such announcement
 duusari ore democrates diwaar ke liye funding ke khilaaf hai kyonki border par diwaar khadaa karnaa unke lihaaj se aniatik or bekaar he
 Democrats say that this issue can be resolved only by talking to the respective governments
 isse pehle trump kah chuke hai ki vah kai saal tak aanshik sarkari kambandi ke liye taiyaar hai
 This is the third week of government shutdown
 is kambandi kii vajah se 22 disambar se ab tak 8,00,000 karmchaariyon ko vetan nahin mila he
 Trump recently said in a press conference that we can declare a national emergency and build the wall soon
 maine abhi yah nahin kiya he
 i can do it yadi ham ise baatcheet ke jariye kar sakate hai to ham behatar tareeke se karenge
 Trump also considered the option of building a steel wall instead of building a cement wall on the border
 haalanki, unhone is sambhaavna par adhik jaankaree nahin di
 He said that 5 for wall construction
 6 arab dollar kii tatkaal jarurat he kyonki ham khel ke bare main baat nahin kar rahe hai, ham rashtriya suraksha kii baat kar rahe hai

 Of these, 12 boys are still at their homes while four have been arrested for being found suspicious
 ve chaaron is vakt jail main band hai
 Attempts to lead many young people of Uttar Pradesh to Jihad through social media have been exposed by the investigating agencies
 aise hi pichley saal ek bade madul kaa khulaasa bhi kiya gaya tha
 Since then, the ATS has been closely watching about 16 boys living in Uttar Pradesh

 While 12 youth are at their homes
 is baat kii jaankaree upi aties ke aiji aseem arun ne ajtak se ek khaas baatcheet main di
 In this exclusive conversation, IG Asim Arun said that all 16 boys found suspicious are being de-radicalized
 unase baatcheet kii ja rahi he
 The ATS is in constant contact with the four boys who are in jail
 aiji aties ke mutabik sabhi ladakon ko achche moulanaon se milwakar dharm kaa sahi tarika bataaya ja rahaa he

 Aadhaar, which provides unique identity to every citizen of India, is ready for major changes in the new year
 aane vaale varsh main iske ofline pushtikaran kii suvidha gati pakadegi or naye bank khaaton or mobile conection ke liye 12 ankon kii anuthi pahchaan sankhya anivaary nahin rah jaaegi
 Following the Supreme Court's landmark judgment and other developments this year about the constitutional recognition of Aadhaar, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in 2019 will work towards making the Aadhaar card more practical and useful
 iske tahat i-aadhaar or kuar code jaise madhyamon se aadhaar ko ofline istemaal kii taraf le jane par jor rahegaa
 In such mediums, Aadhar card holders will not need to reveal their biometric identities, these processes are likely to gain momentum this year
 ullekhneey he ki skool main namakan, vivaah ke praaanpatr, kar ke bhugtan se lekar naye mobile conection lene tak main aadhaar kii jarurat padane lagi or yah kisi vyakti kii pahchaan ke liye sabase pehali pasand ban gaya
 Although this 1
 22 karod aadhaar carddharakon ke liye tab tak sahi rahaa jab tak ki yah andeh paidaa nahin hua ki saadhaaran sevaaon ke liye bhi aadhaar kaa istemaal logon kii niztaa main dakhal dene vaala he
 After this, the Supreme Court gave constitutional recognition to the world's largest biometric database, but redefined its imperative
 sheersh adaalat ne chaar ke mukaable ek mat se apane faisle main kaha ki aadhaar iskar ritern daakhil karne or pan number aavantit karne ke liye anivaary bana rahegaa
 However, the court granted permission to private companies of telecom and other sectors to confirm the biometric information of the people
 isse vibhinn sevaaon ke liye aadhaar ko anivaary banaaye jane kii sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi yojana ko jhatka laga
 After this landmark decision, companies such as banks, telecom companies and financial technology were once again looking for other options to verify the identity of customers
 ye companiyaan aadhaar i-kevaisi par bahut adhik nirbhar hone lagi thi
 Soon after, UIDAI came up with other options like QR (quick Response) code and e-aadhaar

 On one hand, Pakistani wazir-e-azam Imran Khan is counting the benefits of friendship between India and Pakistan, while on the other side of Pakistan, terror is spewing poison
 aatankisanghathan jaish-e-mohammad kaa sargana or sansad hamale ke gunahagaarmoulana masood azharne apni zahreeli awaz main 9 minute kii ekaudiotepe jari kar bharat kodhamkide rahaa he
 Masood Azhar has said that his terrorists are eyeing Ayodhya
 uskaa kahana he ki agar ayodhya main musalamaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaa gaya to wo dilli se kabul tak koharaam machaa degaa
 Be it the blast in the Parliament of India or the Pathankot attack or the attack on the Srinagar Assembly, the name of a terrorist came behind everyone and that terrorist is Masood Azhar
 ek baar phir wo aatanki apane bill se aa gaya he
 And as soon as he comes out, he has started spewing poison in his tongue again
 wo dhamkee de rahaa he ki dilli se kabul tak tabaahi failaa denge
 He is saying, 'there will be panic of the golden color, there will be a storm of torrents
 'masood azhar ke kehane kaa matlab he ki wo hindustan main aisi tabaahi machayegaa ki phija main barudi rang hoga
 And there will be blood splattered all over the ground
 kul milakar bharat main dehshat failaane kii dhamkee de rahaa he sansad hamale or pathankot hamale kaa mastermind masood azhar
 But the question is, what is the reason for this sudden threat of Masood Azhar? aatanki saganthan jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana masood ajahar ne ram mandir vivaad ko lekar 9 minute kaa ek nayaa audio jari kiya he
 In this audio, Maulana Masood Azhar is threatening that if India builds Ram temple on the site of Babri Masjid, then it will create chaos from Delhi to Kabul
 dilli se kabul tak tabaahi kii kaali aandhi chalaane kii dhamkee dene vaale moulana masood azhar ne apane bayaan se saaf kar diya he ki uske aatanki bharat main, or kabul main bharatiyon ko nishaanaa banaaenge
 In his statement, Maulana Masood Azhar is repeatedly trying to intimidate and provoke Muslims
 jaish-e-mohammad ke is sargana ko sirf musalamaanon se shikawa nahin balki use pakistani hukmaraanon se bhi shikaayat he
 Said Masood Azhar that the government of Pakistan is dead
 agar aisa naa hota to duniya ke str par bharat kii ji huzuri kar ke wo apane mulk kii badanaami naa karaate
 However, this is not new when this jaish-e-mohammed terrorist has released a jackal to threaten India by releasing audio
 isse pehle bhi moulana masood azhar ke kai aise dhamkee bhare audio jari ho chuke hai
 But this is why Indian agencies are taking this audio with seriousness
 kyonki pichley dinon desh main jaish kii gatividhiyaan kaaphi bad gai hai
 According to intelligence agencies, jaish-e-mohammed terrorists are planning to attack Delhi's security bases
 itnaa hi nahin aatanki pulavama main maare gaye unke commander osman eliyas kii maut kaa badla lene kii planning bhi kar rahe hai
 In the Delhi Assembly, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal attacked Lt Governor Anil Baijal fiercely
 kejariwal ne kaha ki LG kaa outkam report har saal aayega
 LG has responded to this outcome report
 ham chaahate hai ki janata ke saamne saare tathy aa jaaen or janata tay kar le
 Kejriwal said that it has benefited from lg's response that there has been a situation of dialogue between Delhi Government and LG Office and the people of Delhi should know what is the matter? Kejriwal said that LG said in 10,000 files 97% of files passed
 lekin 3% kaa matlab 300 filein sin nahin kii
 These were the files associated with the policy
 9700 file to routine thim
 Kejriwal said that the 300 files LG has not passed, while the files are one of the most important files
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki LG se har buudhvaar ko meeting hoti he
 i have been very earnest in front of them to get the files passed
 lekin wo nahin maanate
 Speaking in his well-known style, Kejriwal also targeted the officers of Delhi and said that the officers do not want corruption to stop
 unhone kaha ki lgmukyamamwriko kuch nahin samajhate
 Is this the honor of the Chief Minister? LG has full power, but no responsibility
 hamaare paas puri jimmedaari he lekin power nahin he
 All the files he has passed are done under media pressure

 sachin tendulkar to aitihaasik shatak nahin bana paye lekin rahul dravid ne cricket ke makka lords par bejod saikadaa jadkar bharat ko england ke khilaaf pehle test cricket main phaloan se bachaaya
 Tendulkar returned to the pavilion after scoring 34 runs before reaching the close of his 100th international century but Dravid, despite falling wickets continuously, played an unbeaten innings of 103 runs, sticking like a 'wall' at one end
 unki patibaddhta or sankalpapurna bemisaal pari se bharat ne apni pehali pari main 286 ran banaaye
 England had declared their first innings ended by scoring 474 for eight wickets and got a big lead of 188 runs in the first innings
 usne tisare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak duusari pari main bina kisi nuksaan ke paanch ran banaaye
 England's overall lead is now 193 runs and they have tightened their grip on the match
 bharat ke liye buree khabar yah he ki jahir duusari pari main bhi gendbaaji ke liye nahin utre
 Stuart Broad played a key role in giving England the lead, with speculation about his inclusion in the playing XI before the match
 broad ne 37 ran dekar chaar wicket liye
 Apart from him, Chris Tremlett took three and James Anderson took two wickets
 dravid ne apane karier kaa 33waan, england ke khilaaf chauthaa or lords par pehla shatak jamaaya
 He also left Steve Va (32 centuries) with this century
 is star ballebaaj ne apni pari main 220 gend kheli tathaa 15 chauke lagaaye
 All eyes were on the Lord's at Tendulkar's century but Dravid was the hero of the Indian innings
 unhen subah jald hi krij par kadam rakhana padaa or duusare chor se lagaataar wicket girane ke baavjood ek chor se vah ran banaate rahe
 Shriman Bhavishya came out to bat when India lost Gambhir's wicket on a score of 63
 broad ne outswinger par gambhir kaa middle stump ukhadkar bharat ko pehla jhatka diya tha
 He then sentenced Mukund to hasten to complete his half-century
 broad kii baahar jaati gend unke balle kaa andruni kinaaraa lekar aaf stump ukhaad gayi
 When Tendulkar stepped on the crease, the audience stood and greeted him
 tendulkar ke mahashatak kaa sabhi gavaah bananaa chaahate the or unhone bhi sakaaratmak shuruyaat kii
 At lunch, India's score was 102 for two wickets
 tendulkar ne duusare satr ke pehle over main anderson par do chauke jamaaye
 Dravid also hit three fours in the same bowler's over after which Andrew Strauss replaced him with off-spinner Graeme Swann
 tendulkar haalanki dhime pad gayi the or straas ne jab broad ko duusare spel ke liye waapas laaye to unhone aate hi bhartiya cricket premiyon ko sann kar diya
 Tendulkar caught Swann in the second slip and returned to the pavilion
 unhone baahar jaati gend ko sharir kaa istemaal kiye bina khelnaa chaha jo unke balle kaa bahari kinaaraa lekar kaich main badal gayi
 Tendulkar is playing his fifth match at Lord's and his highest score is only 37 runs
 ab is maidan par unka ausat 22
 Is 87
 broad apane agle over main bharat ko chauthaa jhatka bhi de dete lekin straas ne slip main lakshmana kaa aasaan kaich chhod diya
 Laxman could not take advantage of this and he flicked Tremlett's ball and bounced it in the air and lost the wicket by mistake
 swaan ne agle over main raina ko pagabaadha out karke bharat kaa score paanch wicket par 183 ran kar diya
 Dravid had earlier hit a four off Swan's ball to take his score to 50
 iske saath hi vah test cricket main sarvaadhik ran banane vaale duusare ballebaaj ban gayi
 More runs than them are now registered in Tendulkar's name
 bharat jab sankat main tha tab dravid or dhoni ne chathe wicket ke liye 57 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 Both of them did not allow wickets to fall for more than an hour in the third season
 england ne 80 over baad nayi gend lee or tremelet ne team ko iskaa phayda bhi dilaayaa
 He caught Dhoni in the slip on a good length ball and then forced Harbhajan to take a catch behind the wicket
 bharat tab phaloan se 34 ran peeche tha
 Praveen Kumar (17) saved India from the follow-on by sharing a 35-run partnership with Dravid before Brad caught a bouncer
 dravid shatak puraa karne main safal rahe
 He achieved this by taking two runs off Tremlett's ball
 anderson ne iske baad jahir or ishanth sharma ko out karke apane naam par bhi wicket likhvaaye
 Strauss was playing for three at the end of the day's play, while Alastair Cook was yet to open his account

 The security forces carried out several operations against the terrorist modules involved in this attack and eliminated the entire terrorist module within 60 days

 But there is a contradiction in this video that the new Dalit supporters of the BJP engaged in wooing the Dalits can get Mayawati's ridicule in such a way
 yah bhi ascharyajanak he ki mayawati par bhaajapa kaa tazaa hamalaa aise samay main ho rahaa he jab wo raajnneetik rup se kamazor or haashie par nazar aa rahi hai
 In fact, the demonetisation injury suffered by the Forwards, the BJP is trying to convert it into a neuter of the great loss of a leader with a Dalit identity in the caste struggle
 yah vahi nerative he jiskaa sukh un garibon ko mil rahaa tha, jo notebandi ke baad yah sochakar khush the ki amiron ke to or bhi zyaada bade khajaane bekaar ho gaye hai
 Mayawati is not very relevant in Gujarat, nor is the population of Dalits very large and decisive in Gujarat
 haa magar modi ji mayawati ko chot kii kahani agadon ko sunaakar shaayad kahana chaahate hai ki duniya main kitna gam he, tera gam kitna kam he
 The BJP also feels that this gimmick of the image of the Dalit leader if the opposition tries to move ahead by making an issue in the elections will give rise to caste polarization and the BJP will benefit
 lekin bhaajapa yah bhul rahi he ki raajnneetik vipaksh ke atirikt agar anya tareekon se yah video daliton ke bich viral hota he to bhaajapa main daliton kii nai aamad bhaajapa ke khilaaf ja sakati he
 In an attempt to show a greater advantage and a bigger advantage, the BJP has played a tough bet
 dekhte hai ye daanv sahi padataa he yaa ulta

 rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke ek or netamunaf hakimne shuukravaar ko party se istipha de diya
 Hakim objected to the statement by Sharad Pawar in which he defended Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Rafael Dealmudde
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko hi party ke saansad tarik anwar ne bhiensipichhod di or loksabhaa se bhi istipha de diya
 Munaf Hakim is counted among the senior leaders of NCP
 maharashtramen ye party ke bade chehre ke taur par gine jate the
 Munaf served as the party's general secretary until his resignation
 ensipi ke sansthaapak netaaon main shaamil hone ke saath hi ve pradesh alpsankhyak ayog ke adhyaksh bhi the
 Prior to Hakim, Anwar resigned from the Lok Sabha along with leaving the NCP
 anwar ne 1999 main sonia gandhi ke videshi mul ke mudde par congress se baghawat karsharad pavaarke saath ensipi banaai thi
 Tariq Anwar accepted Aaj Tak's resignation and said, 'I have left NCP and have also resigned from Lok Sabha
 'tarik anwar ne kaha, pavaar sahab kaa rafel par bayaan mujhe thik nahin laga
 Cleanliness came from NCP but it is not right
 pavaar sahab ne jab bayaan diya tha to khud unako safai deni chahie thi
 Although there was no explanation from his side, i resigned
 ensipi chhodane ke baad kis party main jaaenge is sawaal par tarik anwar ne kaha ki ye abhi tay nahin he
 i will decide after talking to the supporters
 iske baad bataaungaa
 According to sources, Totarik may return to the Congress once again after resigning from the anwarcp
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tarik anwar bihar ke katihaar se jeet hasil kii thi
 On Anwar's resignation, senior NCP leader Praful Patel told news agency ANI, "it is a matter of great regret that one of our senior leaders decided to resign from Lok Sabha and NCP
" tajjub kii baat he ki unhone pavaar kii ore se ek news channel ko die intervyuu par yah faisla kiya, jabaki rafel ke bare main saare tathy lagbhag spasht hai
 It is a sad day for us that our senior colleague has decided to quit Lok Sabha & also NCP
 It's very surprising because he has based his decision on an interview by Sharad Pawar to news channel wherein facts are very clear on # rafale:praful Patel, NCP on Tariq Anwar quitting partypic
 twitter
 com / k8gkxxpbpe— ANI (@ani)september 28, 2018bataa den ki guuruuvaar ko rafel maamle par ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar kemodisarkaar kaa samarthan karne kii khabar ai thi, jis par baad main ensipi ne safai dete hue kaha tha ki aisi koi baat nahin kahi gai he
 As soon as the power is at hand, the leaders start forgetting everything else, in the glow of power, they do not even remember how important it is to maintain communication with those who have reached here on their own
 narendra modi sarkaar ke mantriyon kii kahani bhi kuch aisi hi he
 As soon as reaching the corridors of power, the BJP workers and leaders themselves are ready to open the packet of complaints against their ministers
 ye baat pradhanmantri narendra modi ke paas bhi pahunch hi gai
 What was it then? Modi, known for his discipline and his tough stance, imposed the duty of 6 senior ministers to meet party mps at their dinner and deal with their problems
 party saansadon ko 60-60 ke group main baanta gaya or dinar par pehali mulaakaat videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj or duusari grahamantri rajnath singh ke saath rakhi gai
 In the first meeting, apart from Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah, several party officials were present
 sutron kii maane to baithak main kai saansadon ne modi se shikaayat kii ki mantri se milane ke liye party saansadon ko kai din chakkar kaatane padate hai kaam karwaanaa to dur kii baat he
 In a dinner meeting with Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Praveen Verma complained to Rajnath that party MP Pravesh Verma even said in front of Amit Shah that a Union minister is deliberately trying to stop projects of his parliamentary constituency
 jinase janata kaa nuksaan to ho hi rahaa he party kii image bhi kharaab ho rahi he
 Many more mps also supported Pravesh Verma's talk
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah nesaansdonko naseehat di kii wo bataur saansad apni shakti ko pahachaane
 Take the responsibility of your area completely and take the policies of the Center
 piem lenge badlaav kii reportsaansadon kii shikayaton ko sulajhane ke liye manohar parrikar, arun jetali, venkaiya naidu, nitin gadakari ke saath bhi aise dinar rakhe jaaenge
 In fact, in view of the upcoming election, there have been indications from the party high command that the change in the behavior of the ministers for the workers can prove fatal for the party
 isliye samay rahete party saansadon kii naaraazgi ko dur karnaa behad jaruri he
 After having a dinner meeting with all the ministers, the Prime Minister himself will report the changes from the mps to see to what extent the minister is connected to the common man and the worker after he gets out of power

 This time the controversy is about the women's curd handi competition
 hindu jan-jagriti samiti ne kaha he ki mahila dahi handi pratiyogita hindu dharm kii samskruti ke khilaaf he
 This festival, which is celebrated every year, is celebrated with great enthusiasm
 jaankaron kii maane to dahi-handi pratiyogita ko sirf tyohaar kii najar se hi nahin balki saahsee khel kii najar se bhi dekha jaataa he
 Women have also been a part of this festival for the last several years
 lekin hindu jan-jaagran samiti ne is tyohaar main mahilaon ke shaamil hone ko lekar sawaal uthaaya he
 According to Hindu public awareness, Hinduism is being destroyed by the participation of women in this festival
 is vivaad ke baad mahila dahi-handi mandalon ne kadaa aitraaj jataayaa he
 Women dahi-handi divisions have termed it an insult to women and said that they will definitely take part in this competition
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle bombai hoicourt ne 18 saal kii umr se kam logon ke pratiyogita main shaamil hone par roak lagaai thi or is pratiyogita se jude kai disha-nirdesh jari kiye the
 However, there is very little time left in the dahi-handi competition and in such a situation, the color of this festival may not fade in the new controversy arising every day

 However, during this time these mlas could not find any leader in the BJP office because the work of renovation is going on in the BJP office and that is why the office and other leaders are not coming in the BJP office
