 Rahul Gandhi has arrived in Amethi on Wednesday i
e
 Wednesday to find the reason for the defeat in Amethi parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 rahul kaa yah daura ab tak ke baaki daure se kaaphi alag he
 Rahul himself will remain silent and listen to the minds of small and big Congress workers
 rahul apane is daure ke jariye yah sandesh dene kii koshish karenge ki haar ke baad bhi unka amethi se rishta tutaa nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi will interact with Congress leaders at Nirmala Devi Degree College, Gauriganj
 rahul congress ke gram sabha, nyaay panchayat or blaak adhyakshon se mulaakaat karenge
 Apart from this, the village headmen and members of the district panchayat have also been called to the meeting

 The situation had become such that during the elections he could not even meet Congressmen to seek support from them

 This video CD, broadcast on some local TV channels here, shows JMM leader Shibu Soren in the presence of senior BJP leaders Karuna Shukla, Arjun Munda and Deputy Chief Minister and AJSU leader Sudesh Mahato in the current government saying that BJP and JMM In Jharkhand, an agreement has been reached to lead the government in the state for 28-28 months
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki yah sidi 18 may 2010 ko hi recorded he
 When asked about this, JMM leaders kept silence, while BJP state president Dineshanand Goswami said that the video shown on TV channels belonged to the state government led by Shibu Soren in May 2010
 shibu sorain kii sarkaar se jab bhaajapa ne samarthan vaapasi kii baat kahi thi, us samay is tarah ke samjhaute kii baat jhamumo ne kii thi
 Goswami said that in September 2010, a coalition government was formed in the state under Munda's leadership only when the JMM promised unconditional support to the BJP
 sidi ke farji hone kii baat isse bhi jaahir ho gai he ki sitambar main yadi bhaajapa-jhamumo main baari-baari se sarkaar kaa netritv karne kaa koi samjhauta hota bhi to yah samjhauta 25-25 yaa 26-26 maah kaa hi hota, kyonki sitambar 2010 ke baad rajya kii vartmaan vidhansabha kaa sirf 51 se 52 maah kaa hi kaarykaal shesh bachaa tha
 The current state assembly was formed on December 23, 2009 after the elections held in november-december 2009
 lihaaja iskaa kaarykaal disambar-2014 tak hi he
 Another senior BJP leader Balmukund Sahai said that strict legal action should be taken against those who were involved in trying to destabilize the state government by showing fake cds like this
 duusari ore, kuch anya channelon ne may 2010 or sitambar 2010 ke bhaajapa-jhamumo baithkon or samvaadadaata sammelnon ke video footage jari kar yah bhi darshaya ki jis farji sidi ko sitambar 2010 kaa bataaya gaya he vah vastav main may kii hi he, kyonki may vaale footage ke vastra hi dikhaayi gayi sidi main bhaajapa netaaon or shibu sorain ne pahan rakhe hai

 grih mantralay ne bhaajapa saansad subrahmanyam swami ke aarope ke aadhaar par congress netaa se ek pakhwaade andar naagarikta ke bare main apni sthiti spasht karne ko kaha he
 Various responses are being expressed to this notice of the Home Ministry, and it is not unbecoming in the electoral atmosphere as everyone has got a chance to hear something on it
 haalanki behatar hota ki grih mantralay is bare main apane dastavej or naagarikta sambandhi bharat ke kanoon dekh letaa
 It does not accuse him of working for a particular party
 bharat main paidaa hone vaala vyakti bhartiya naagarik hota he
 This was a simple rule between 1950 and 1 July 1987
 iske baad ke sanshodhan kii baat phir kabhi lekin rahul gandhi isi avadhi main paidaa hue hai
 Meanwhile, he did not return his Indian passport

 Now the question is, where was Rahul Gandhi born? According to a document with India Today, Rahul Gandhi was born on 19 June 1970 at Holy Family Hospital in New Delhi
 aspataal ke register main unhen ‘baby sonia gandhi’, pita kaa naam ‘rajeev gandhi’, ling ‘emasi’ yani mail child, rashtriyata ‘indian’, dharm ‘hindu’ or pataa ‘nan
 1, Safdarjung Road, New Delhi '
 nai dilli ke okhla main sthit holi family hospital kii sthapana 1953 main medical mishan sisters kii sansthaapak ana maaria dengal ne kiya tha
 Sister Dengel, a resident of Austria, found that women in the Okhla area on the outskirts of Delhi were reluctant to treat male doctors
 unhone vahiin holi family hospital kholaa or khaskar kamjor tabake kii mahilaon kaa ilaaj shuru kiya
 For a long time, doctors working in foreign or foreign degrees worked in it
 aspataal ke 23 acre ke parisar main das saal baad ek nursing college shuru kiya gaya, jo dilli vishvavidhyalay se sambhddha he
 Over time, various departments started opening in the hospital and today there is a heart center in addition to women's disease, pediatrics and other kidney transplants are also being done
 yahi nahin, is 345 bed vaale aspataal main emarai, siti angeography or vibhinn aadhunik chikitsa ke upkaran hai
 There are 24 Holy Family Hospitals worldwide including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and USA
 desh kii tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne apane pote ke janm ke liye isi aspataal ko kyon chunaa? holi family hospital, nai dilli ke diarector fadar jorge muskaraate hue kehete hai, ‘‘yah aspataal stri rog or jaccha-baccha kii dekharekh ke maamle main shuru se hi bahut acha rahaa he
 And then there were not so many doctors and hospitals
 iske alaava, seva hamaara pehla uddeshy he, shaayad is vajah se unhone ise hi chunaa hoga
 Incidentally, the medical superintendent of this hospital, Dr
 sumbul varsi hai
 Pediatrician Dr
 varsi britain main enechaes main kaam karti thim or ve bhi sevabhaav kii vajah se swadesh lautakar holi family hospital se jud gayi
 Indira Gandhi's trust in this hospital remained
 do saal baad jab priyanka gandhi paidaa hone vaali thim tab unhone apni bahu sonia gandhi ko ek baar phir isi aspataal main bhartee karaayaa
 According to hospital records, Priyanka Gandhi was born on 12 January 1972
 register main ling ke aage ‘epasi’ yani femail child likhaa he
 All other information is like Rahul's, nationality 'indian', religion 'hindu' and address' no
 1, safadarajang road, nai dilli’
 Hopefully, tomorrow no one will question Priyanka Gandhi's nationality and religion

 kairana loksabhaa seat ke liye 28 may ko hone vaale upachunaav ko ‘bijepi banaam vipakshi ekajutata’kii jang bataaya ja rahaa he
 Kairana is in western Uttar Pradesh, considered the sugarcane belt
 is chunavi ladaai ko kshetra main ‘jinna banaam ganna’ jaisaa naam bhi diya ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you that during the campaign for the recently concluded Karnataka Assembly elections, the issue of Jinnah's picture in Aligarh Muslim University was seen arising loudly
 kairana loksabhaa seat ko apane paas barkaraar rakhane ke liye bijepi kaa bada daaromadar hindutv card par hi he
 On the other hand, a united opposition is also in the fray
 vipaksh kaa daawa he ki yahaan jinna nahin ganna mudda he
 According to the opposition, the cane arrears of farmers will play a decisive role in Kairana
 bijepi kii hindutv prayogshalakairana ko kshetra main bijepi kii hindutv prayogshaala ke taur par bhi dekha jaataa rahaa he
 The by-election is being held here due to the demise of BJP MP Hukum Singh
 bataa den ki hukum singh ne hi uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle hinduon ke kshetra se kathith palaayan ke mudde ko uthaaya tha
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won the Kairana seat by a large margin of votes
 lekin uske baad se is ganna belt main bahut kuch hua he
 Sugarcane payment is a big issue
 Actually, non-payment of sugarcane to farmers by sugar mills is a big issue
 isi par kisaanon kii naaraazgi ke chalate kairana seat par bijepi ko apni ranneeti badalte hue hindutv card kii ore lautnaa padaa he
 UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered a CBI inquiry in 2010 by the then Mayawati government's decision to sell 21 sugar mills
 yogi sarkaar ke is kadam ko rajya main chini udyog ke kharaab halaat kaa thikra pichhali sarkaar par phodne ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 India Today reached a sugar mill located in Amroha to know the ground situation, which was sold to a private company
 jab is mil ko mayawati sarkaar ne sharaab kaarobaari ponti chaddha ke wave group ko bechaa tha, tab yahaan har din 3000 metric ton ganne kii perai hoti thi
 When the mill was entrusted to private hands, it was promised that the mill would be modernized, as well as to increase its crushing capacity
 lekin 8 saal baad is mil kii durdasha saaf dekhi ja sakati he
 Here the crispy condition of chimneys with rust in the machines itself tells the whole story
 sibiai jaanch se noummidjis privet company ko tohfe ke taur par mil ko saunpa gaya tha, usne ek saal ke andar hi yahaan oparation ko band kar diya
 When the Yogi government came to power in 2017, there was hope among the farmers
 lekin yogi sarkaar kii ore sibiai jaanch kaa aadesh die jane ke baad logon ko mil ke jaldi dobaaraa shuru hone kii jo ummid thi, wo bhi khatm ho gai
 The mill was sold for a mere 17 crore rupees
 kaig (CAG) kii report ke mutabik amroha shahar ke bichobich sthit mil jis 30 hectare jameen par sthit he vahi saikadon karod kii he
 The then Mayawati government sold a total of 21 sugar mills to private companies
 kaig report ne mayawati sarkaar ko chini milon kii bikri se sarkari khajaane ko 1200 karod rupye kaa nuksaan pahunchane kaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 Farmer Zorawar Singh told India Today, "the farmers then understood that the sugar mill was being sold to the private company for their benefit, but after a year the mill closed, the farmers understood that Mayawati had Had to benefit the private company
 kisaan union ke netaa viem singh kehete hai, ab kisaanon ko apana ganna dur sthit milon tak le janaa padataa he
 After the closure of the Amroha mill, there is also pressure on those mills
 yogi sarkaar ko mil main dobaaraa perai shuru karaane ke liye koshish kerani chahie thim, lekin ab aisa hota nahin lagata
 The decision taken before the Kairana by-election (CBI investigation) is politically motivated
 'yogi ke faisle par shakganna belt main yogi sarkaar ke faisle ko shaq kii najar se dekha ja rahaa he ki kisaanon ko 14 din main bhugtan kar diya jayega
 Because farmers have not received a single penny as payment in this season
 kisaan union kaa aarope he ki yogi sarkaar samay se bhugtan kii naakaami ko chupaane ke liye dhyaan bantaana chaahati he
 This season, sugar mills owe Rs 12,000 crore
 mil maalik desh main ganne kii keemten girane kii vajah se hue nuksaan kii bharpai ke liye sarkaar se raahat package maang rahi hai
 Sugarcane, which was Rs 3721 per quintal in July last year, fell to Rs 2700 per quintal in April this year
 karj maafee kaa vaada adhuraabagapat main nangala gaanv ke kisaanon ne india today ko bataaya ki chini milen ganne se chini banaate samay nikalne vaale sah utpaadon se motaa munafa kama rahi hai or saath main sabhi ko gumraah bhi kar rahi hai
 These farmers say that the promise of payment of sugarcane was not fulfilled in time
 saath hi kisaanon ke karj maafee kaa vaada puraa hona bhi abhi baaki he
 More or less the same situation can be seen in Kairana
 kairana loksabhaa seat ke tahat paanch vidhansabha siten aati hai
 Three of them are in Shamli district and two in Saharanpur
 kshetra main chah chini mil hai
 Four mills are owned by private companies
 vahiin do sahakaari kshetra main hai
 In view of the by-elections, the Yogi government pressured private sector sugar mills to take sugarcane of farmers of the entire region
 lekin kisaan ganne kaa bhugtan nahin milane kii shikaayat kar rahe hai
 Long queues of farmers with sugarcane can be seen outside the Upper Doab sugar mill
 tapati dhoop or raat ko machharon ke prakope ke bich bhi kisaan qatari main lage rahete hai, isi koshish main ki unka ganna chini mil tak pahunch jaae
 On talking to the farmers, there were some who were seen praising the Yogi government very much
 kisaan randhir singh ne kaha, ‘mukhyamantri yogi adityanath apane is vaade par khare utre hai ki jab tak kisaanon ke kheton main ganna khadaa he tab tak chini milen kaam karti rahengi
 At the same time, there are no such farmers who are seen expressing resentment against the Yogi government
 kisaan satbir ko apana ganna thana bhawan se shamali laane ke liye kaaphi faasla tay karnaa padataa he
 Often, the Bajaj sugar mill in his area has stopped taking more sugarcane from farmers
 satbir kehete hai, ‘ganna mantri mere kshetra se hai
 What is the use of them when they cannot keep the sugar mill open by their influence
 ’kisaan ganna vikaas mantri suresh rana se naakhush najar aate hai
 They allege that the ministers are favoring private mill owners while the farmers won the BJP with heavy votes in the region in the 2017 assembly elections
 kisaan rambir kehete hai, ‘puri ganna belt ne bijepi ke paksh main vot diya tha
 With the hope that the coming BJP government in UP with the Modi government at the Center will remove the problems of sugarcane farmers, but we have had to be very disappointed
 ’kairana loksabhaa seat par upachunaav ke liye bijepi ne divangat hukum singh kii beti mriganka singh ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 He is facing a tough challenge from National Lok Dal candidate Tabassum Hasan
 tabassum hasan ko samaajawaadee party, bispi, congress or aam aadmi party kaa bhi samarthan hasil he
 There are around 17 lakh voters on the Kairana Lok Sabha seat
 inamen teen lakh muslim, chaar lakh pichhadi jati (jat, gujjar, saini, kashyap, prajapati or anya) or dedh lakh dalit vot hai
 Electoral Mathematics In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Kairana won BJP candidate Hukum Singh with 5,65,909 votes
 unke nikatatam pratidwandvi nahid hasan ko 3,29,081 mili the
 Kanwar Hassan of BSP got 1,60,414 votes and Kartar Bhadana of Rashtriya Lok Dal got 42706 votes
 jinna banaam gannarashtriya lokdal ke mukhiya ajit singh bijepi par aarope lagaate hai ki usne chunaav se pehle jinna vivaad khadaa kiya
 Ajit Singh also believes that the issue of sugarcane arrears will decide the outcome of the election Ajit Singh's son Jayant Singh is working hard in campaigning for party candidate Tabassum Hasan
 jayant bhi aashwast hai ki kairana main jinna vivaad kaa koi asar nahin hoga
 According to Jayant, the fear of Hindu exodus that the BJP had created before the assembly elections, had gone away at that time, but now voters have understood the tactics of this kind of distribution
 bijepi ummidavaar mriganka singh kaa kahana he ki kairana upachunaav main logon kaa vishwaas phir se jeetne ko wo apane liye bhaavnaatmak ladaai maanati hai
 Mriganka says, 'the issue of Hindu exodus is now a thing of the past
 main kshetra main yuvakon ke liye rojgaar laana chaahati hum
 Will work in this direction
 mere pita kii viraasat mujhe jeetne main madad karegi
 'india Today has exclusive information that the Yogi government is sitting on the order of the Allahabad High Court under which farmers were to be paid interest for the delay in cane payment in three seasons (2012 to 2015)
 isse pehle akhilesh sarkaar ne court ke faisle se alag jaakar chini milon kaa saath diya tha
 The High Court ordered the Yogi government to take a fresh decision in this regard in four months in March 2017
 lekin ab use bhi ek saal se upar vakt biit gaya he
 The total outstanding between 2011 and 2017 has reached above Rs 3500 crore
 bijepi kii ranneetijankaron kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke paas dhruvikaran ke alaava bahut kam hi vikalp bache hai
 Senior Shamli journalist Lokesh Pandit told India Today, "the BJP can bet on polarization of votes on communal basis as the arrears of Jat voters, Dalits and sugarcane may go against the party in the elections

 It cannot run like this ”
 tomars kii awaz sunakar swasthya yantriki mantri sukhdev paanse khadey ho gayi or kaha ki mukhyamantri ke khilaaf is tarah ke lahaze ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega, unhone yah bhi kaha ki tomars ko baithna chahie 
 
 
 When Kamal Nath tried to intervene in the debate between the two, Tomar went out of the meeting
 tomars ko sindhiya ke kareebi mantriyon govind singh rajput, mahendra singh sisodiya, imarti devi ne rokane kii koshish kii or unki baat kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki naukarshahi unke pradarshan main baadha daal rahi he or unka kaam main unka sahyog nahin kar rahi he
 On this, Kamal Nath went to the bipher and said that he knew who was behind all this, while turning to Tomar, he said, 'you are welcome
 koi bhi aapako roak nahin rahaa he'
 Taking a dig at the matter, BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari said that the ministers did not feel that it was a cabinet meeting and not a party meeting
 hamaara maananaa he ki yah sarkaar zyada dinon kii mehmaan nahin he kyonki congress main andruni gutbazi charam par he
 Meanwhile, according to sources, Kamal Nath supporters are now pressurizing him to weaken the Scindia camp and he may also free Scindia supporters from important portfolios on the pretext of evaluating his cabinet colleagues' six-month performance

 america ne lashkar e taiyaba ko ‘khatra’ ke rup main chihnit karte hue guuruuvaar ko kaha ki yah utana hi khatarnaak he jitne khatarnaak taliban or alqaida hai or lashkar bharat evam pakistan ke bich ‘adhiktam samasyaayein’ khadaa karne ke uddeshy se taliban tathaa alqaida ke saath mil kar kaam kar rahaa he
 Richard Holbrooke, the special US envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, said his country has raised the issue of ISI elements' ties with terrorist groups and asked Pakistan to stop Lashkar from taking steps on its territory
 holebruk ne mumbai hamale kii tah main jane or uske shadyantrkariyon ko nyaay ke daayre main laane kii jarurat par jor dete hue kaha ki pakistan ne is silsile main kuch kadam uthaae hai lekin ye kadam ‘paryaapt nahin’ hai
 Holbrooke, who met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday to explain his assessment of the situation in Afghanistan, said India has to play an 'extremely important role' in bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan
 america vishesh doot ne jor de kar kaha ki america isaki gunjaaish ko ‘khatm’ karne kii koshish nahin kar rahaa he
 He also said that Pakistan has 'legitimate concerns' in Afghanistan and stability cannot be brought there without its participation
 holebruk ne samvaadadaataaon ke saath baatcheet main kaha ki lashkar e taiyaba al-kaayda or taliban ke saath nikat samanvay sthapit kar apni gatividhiyaan chalaa rahaa he or in sanghathanon ke khilaaf mil kar kaam karne kii jarurat he
 The US Special Envoy said the Lashkar responsible for the 26 November Mumbai attack aimed to create 'maximum problems' between India and Pakistan, besides working against the interests of Western countries
 unase poocha gaya ki aisa nahin lagata ki america jis tarah taliban or alqaida se nibat rahaa he, usee tarah vah lashkar e taiyaba se bhi nibat rahaa he
 To this, Holbrook said, "when we talk about major terrorist groups, we consider them as dangerous as other groups
 ’pakistan kii yatra ke baad buudhvaar ko bharat pahunche holebruk ne kaha, ‘sarkaar ke taur par ham samajhate hai ki lashkar e taiyaba ek khatra he or ham pakistani sena se har baar kehete hai ki vah is sanghathan ko apni sarajameen main kadam nahin tikaane de
 Holbrooke said, 'we all know what Lashkar has done and what he wants to do
 ’vishesh america doot ne lashkar e taiyaba ko afgaan taliban, pakistani taliban or hakkaani network vaale aatankwaadi gathjod ke ek hisse ke rup main chihnit kiya or kaha, ‘taliban kareeb-kareeb ek brands ban gaya he
 Holbrooke said, "it seems that due to the tremendous pressure these groups are getting closer to each other
" do yaa teen saal pehle ab ke mukaable ye ek duusare se bahut bhinn the
 "they said that these groups work together and help each other because their long-term goal is the same, to harm Western ideology and to" create maximum problems between India and Pakistan
 " ’ holebruk ne kaha ‘lashkar e taiyaba se nibatna bhi is kshetra kii ek anya praathamikta he
 In response to a question about the Mumbai attacks, he said that Pakistan has taken some steps but they are not enough
 unhone kaha ki america aise muddon par pakistan ke saath khul kar baatcheet kar rahaa he
 Asked about the apprehension that the US may ignore India's role and responsibilities in Afghanistan, Holbrooke said, "nobody wants India to be left behind in Afghanistan
" ’ rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon se mulaakaat kar chuke america vishesh doot ne kaha, ‘afghanistan main bharat ko mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaani he
 However, he refused to disclose the role, saying that the role was of the Indian leadership
 holebruk ne kaha ki bharat or pakistan ke bich koi khel nahin chal rahaa he
 He also tried to dispel fears that Pakistan would try to gain control there after the us-led forces left Afghanistan
 holebruk ne kaha, ‘pakistan afghanistan par niyantran nahin karne ja rahaa he or naa hi taliban aisa karegaa, lekin is kshetra kaa har hissaa samaadhaan main shaamil hoga
 However, the US Special Envoy also said, "without Pakistan's cooperation, there cannot be stability in Afghanistan
 ’ unhone taliban par tippanee karte hue kaha ki afghanistan or kshetra kii suraksha tathaa sthirataa ke liye taliban lagaataar khatra bana hua he

 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, PM Modi also accused the Mamata Banerjee government of acting in an undemocratic manner
 pashchim bengal ke purulia main jab piem modi se poocha gaya ki loksabhaa chunaav ke paanch charnon ke matdaan hone ke baad vipaksh iviem ko lekar aarope laga rahaa he
 Opposition says EVM has also been managed
 is par piem modi ne pratikriya dete hue vipaksh par paraajay ko dekhte hue bahanebaaji karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 During this, PM Modi told the story of a school child
 unhone kaha, 'jab koi baccha skool main jaataa he or exam main thik se uttar nahin likh paata he, to bahanebaaji dhundne lagata he
 On his way out of the exam hall, he thinks on the way, what answer will i give to my parents today? Then he starts making excuses and says that the pen was not good, the bench was not good, the teacher was not well, the boy sitting next used to steal me, for which i was scolded
 
 
 
 And because of which my paper was spoiled
 'pashchim bengal ke purulia main piem modi ne kaha ki exam thik se nahin dene vaale bachche kii tarah congress samet samoochaa vipaksh bahaanaa dhudh rahaa he
 He has a certainty in this Lok Sabha election
 vipaksh apni haar ko dekhte hue baukhalaayaa hua he
 In an exclusive conversation with Aaj Tak, Prime Minister Modi said that earlier the Opposition used to only abuse Modi, but now EVM has also come with Modi on the target of the Opposition when the Lok Sabha elections reach the final point
 ab vipaksh 50 fisadi gaaliyaan modi ko detaa he or 50 fisadi gaaliyaan iviem ko detaa he
 Not only this, now the opposition is slowly starting to abuse the Election Commission as well
 loksabhaa chunaav ko chunavi pariksha bataate hue unhone kaha, 'vipaksh kii baukhalaahat bataa rahi he ki usne apni paraajay sweekaar kar lee he
 These are examples of that
 ' piem modi ne kaha ki jo aaj iviem ko gaali de rahe hai, wo kabhi na kabhi iviem se chunaav jitkar satta main aa chuke hai
 During this time, the Prime Minister also attacked West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress Party
 unhone kaha ki didi aloktantric tareeke se kaam kar rahi hai

 Mishra said, 'he is likely to be discharged in the next seven or 10 days
 ' swaraj kaa shanivaar kokidney transplantkia gaya tha or ek jivit asambaddha daata se lekar unke sharir main kidney transplant kiya gaya tha
 According to Mishra, the woman who donated her kidney to the minister is also in the process of being discharged from the hospital

 anuchhed 370 khatm hone ke baad jammu-kashmir main halaat saamaanya ho rahe hai
 All government offices will open in Srinagar from Monday, August 19
 sutron ke mutabik jammu or kashmir main sabhi shaikshanik santhaan or skool bhi khul jaaenge
 However, no decision has been taken on commissioning internet or landline service yet
 jammu-kashmir main dhara 144 lagu he, skool-college, mobile internet, mobile colling band he
 tv-cable is also banned
 jammu-kashmir ke kai netaaon jinamein purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti, umr abdulla, sajaad lone shaamil hai unhen nazarband kiya gaya he
 Former IAS officer and president of Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement Shah Faisal has also been placed under house arrest
 isi ko lekar kai raajnneetik dal modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 At the same time, with the dismantling of Article 370, the central government's biggest challenge is to keep the situation there under control after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir ends
 ab khabar he ki sarkaar ne apni yojana main badlaav laate hue faisla liya he ki jammu-kashmir kii sthiti par ab srinagar se hi najar rakhi jaaegi
 According to sources, the government has decided to change its plan to keep an eye on not only the entire valley from Srinagar but also both Jammu and Ladakh regions
 mana ja rahaa he jammu-kashmir se vishesh rajya kaa darja khatm kiye jane or uskaa vibhaajan kiye jane ke baad pradarshan or anya hinsak gatividhiyaan ho sakati hai
 In such a situation, heavy security arrangements have been made there and curfew has been imposed in many areas including the valley

 The Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana states that what was wrong with Bhagwat? Saamana wrote, 'muslims converted on the edge of the sword
 mishanri ne paisa or seva ke naam par gud lagaakar garibon ko isai banaaya
 These two truths cannot be denied
 koi khud dharm badalata he to use koi roak nahin saktaa
 But someone converts in the name of service
 usase seva shabd kaa apmaan hota he
 'written in Saamana,' Mohan Bhagwat has brought out the mask named after the missionary
 kya galati kar di? mohan bhagwat ne ek kadava satya kaha he
 What Bhagwat said is absolutely true and for many years missionary people not only in the country but all over the world started using it
 'saamana ke mutabik, 'hindutvvaadi sanghathanon ne ghar vaapasi ke naam par fansaae gaye aise hi logon ko phir se hindu dharm main parivartan karne kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Due to this, many people started having stomach ache
 logon ne hindustan kii dharmik bhaavana jaise shabdon ke naam par ninda kii
 'it was written in it,' When the Church of Delhi was attacked, then the President of America, from the Pope of Rome, all started teaching religious goodwill to India
 lekin usee hindustan main hindu dharm kaa galaa ghotane kaa kaam musalmaan or isai karte hai tab use dharmik swatantraaa kaha jaataa he
 Mohan Bhagwat's statement in Saamana was written as national work, "mohan Bhagwat has done national work by telling the truth of the missionary
 bala sahab thakare jo kehete the us par bhagwat ne muhar laga di he
 Mother Teresa has served the poor tremendously
 baba aamate ne bhi yahi kaam kiya tha lekin kabhi dharmantaran nahin kiya
 What Bhagwat said will force a program like Homecoming
 bhagwat kaa ham shukriya (abhinandan) karte hai

 The government said in the Supreme Court that Vinayak Godse, brother of Nathuram Godse, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, was released after 16 years, then why can't Rajiv Gandhi's killers be released? rajya sarkaar ne chif justise kii aguwai main 5 jajon kii samvidhan peeth ke saamne apana paksh rakhte hue kaha ki rajeev ke hatyare itane saalon se jail main hai

 If the state government wants to release the culprits in the case of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, then what is the problem? sarkaar ne kaha ki court rajya sarkaron ke adhikaar ko chin nahin sakati

 The state government had stated in the Supreme Court that neither did it want to hang Rajiv Gandhi's killers when the UPA government was in power, nor did the opposition party raise any voice for it
 kisi bhi sarkaar ne unhen faansee par latakaane kii ichha shakti nahin dikhaai thi
 Now he has been given life imprisonment
 aise main unhen kab tak jail main rakhaa jaae
 It was argued by the Tamil Nadu government that the death sentence of these people has been converted into life imprisonment in this case
 is tarah kaa jivan kaisaa hoga jisamen koi aashaa hi na ho

 However, questioning the mercy petition during this period, the Supreme Court said whether such a petition can be filed again and again? rajeev gandhi hatyakand main maut kii sajaa se raahat paane vaale sabhi doshiyon ko reeha karne ke tamilnadu sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf daayar yachikaaon par supreme court kii sanvaidhanik peeth main sunwaayee jari he
 In fact, the state government released Santhan, Murugan, Perarivalan and all life convicts Nalini Sriharan, Robert Pius, Ravichandran and Jayakumar, who were relieving the Supreme Court due to the delay in the disposal of mercy petition from the death penalty in the Rajiv Gandhi murder case

 "bihar ko apni sarkaar do, jo he usko gaddi se utaar do"itvaar kii umas bhari dopaher thi
 At the Fatehpur High School in Gaya district, Jitan Ram Manjhi came to the first floor porch giving a speech that around a hundred women surrounded him
 ye sabhi rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan main theke kii karmchaaree hai or dalit pariwaron se hai
 All the women started repeating the same slogan against Manjhi's Nitish government that give Bihar its government
 dholak kii dhun par gaati-thirakati in mahilaon ko dekhakar maanjhi apni lokapriyata ke is badhate hue ufaan se gadgad ho uthe
 The former Bihar chief minister told him, "wait two months
" endie kii sarkaar banate hi ham aapaki sabhi maangen puri kar denge
 "mahajar's village Mahakar is about 70 km from Fatehpur
 vahaan dainik mehnat-mazdooree karne vaale ramashesh maanjhi musahar samudaay ke ladakon ke saath taash phentate hue apni utsukata ko nahin chipa pate
 His fellow laborers watching the game, Maheshwar Manjhi, 50, says gently, "we will teach this government a lesson
" ''mahadalit yaa jatiyon ke kram main sabase nichle paaydaan ke isi musahar samudaay se purv mukhyamantri maanjhi bhi aate hai
 Infrastructure and construction related activities are currently underway in Mahakar
 ye sab maanjhi ke 278 dinon ke rajkaaj kaa hi nateeja hai
 There are only 25 families of Musahars out of about a hundred houses in this village
 lekin ramashesh or maheshwar kii tarah maanjhi ke pehle ke netaa nitish kumaar ke khilaaf bhavanaaen is puure ilaake main dekhne ko milti hai
 The population of Dalits or Scheduled Castes in the state is divided into about 22 sub-castes
 in sabhi logon main rajya ke pehle musahar mukhyamantri ko hataane ke liye ab bhi nitish ke khilaaf kaaphi naaraazgi he
 Nitish Kumar's problem also starts from here
 rajya main in jatiyon kii aabaadi kareeb 15
 9 percent
 isliye ye apane aap main kisi bhi rajnatik morche kii sambhaavnaaen ubhaarne yaa giraane kaa damakham rakhti hai
 If the Dalit castes make up their mind to vote together, then it turns into a strong vote bank like the Yadavs in Bihar
 haalanki rajya ke kai hisson main ab bhi anusuchit jatiyon main nitish kumaar ke prati kaaphi sahanubhuti he
 After all, he was originally in the 18 sub-castes by including three more castes and placed them in the category of Mahadalits and ran various welfare schemes for them
 lekin ab 70 varshiya maanjhi nitish ke saamne chattan kii tarah khadey hai
 In fact, these Dalit voters gave the Janata Dal (united) a clear edge in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and 2010 Assembly elections
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaavon tak anusuchit jatiyon ke liye surakshit siten sabhi partiyon main bant jaaya karti thim
 But that year the JD (U) won four of the six reserved Lok Sabha seats
 phir agle saal vidhansabha chunaavon main kul 38 surakshit siton main se jedy (you) kii aguai main endie ko 37 siten milin
 Lalu Prasad's party RJD, considered the messiah of backward and Dalits in the 1990s, had to be content with just one seat
 is baar kadi takkar vaale do dhruviya chunaavon main jedy (you) argedy-congress mahagathbandhan ko yadav, kurmi or muslim voton main badi hissedari milane kii ummid he
 At the same time, bjp-led NDA is confident of getting the votes of upper castes, tradesmen and traders on a large scale
 saath hi kuch pichhadi jatiyon ke vot milane kii bhi sambhaavna he
 It seems certain to divide the votes of the most backward castes
 aise main dalit voton kaa rujhaan hi nateezon ko prabhavit karne kaa damakham rakhata he
 In the last two elections of 2009 and 2010, Lalu and then his ally Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan had to face the same Dalit votes in favor of NDA
 paswan tab bihar ke sabase bade dalit netaa kahe jate the
 Despite the support of the Paswan caste, the Lok Janshakti Party's account was not even opened in 2009, whereas in the assembly elections next year, they had to satisfy with just three seats
 to lalu kii party vidhansabha main sabase kam 22 siton par simatakar rah gai
 Until just a year ago, this headache was not far away for Nitish Kumar
 alabatta 2014 ke aam chunaavon main hindi pradeshon main baakiyon kii tarah dalit samudaay bhi modi lahar main bah gaya tha, lekin aam chunaav or vidhansabha chunaav main bahut fark he
 Assembly elections have been fought on separate grounds
 ab jeethanram maanjhi ke dalit netaa ke taur par ubharne se yah sara ganit gadabada gaya he
 The political equation for the non-paswan Dalit votes that Nitish had prepared as Chief Minister has stood in the head
 nitish ne sabase nichle paaydaan kii dalit up-jatiyon ke kalyaan ke liye 2007 main mahadalit ayog kaa gathan kiya
 He then also announced several welfare schemes for them
 ise unka pehla master stroke mana gaya
 And when Nitish decided to resign and make a Mahadalit Manjhi Chief Minister after the humiliating defeat of 2014, political pundits called the move his second master stroke
 lekin mukhyamantri maanjhi ne dalit nayak ke rup main ubharne main samay jaaya nahin kiya
 And carved out a niche among the Dalit community
 unke pehle rajya ke pehle or aakhri dalit mukhyamantri ramsundar das hi hue the
 His 303-day reign ended in February 1980, just 35 years before Manjhi's tenure
 vaise, maanjhi kaa das maheene kaa kaarykaal vivaadaaspad bayanon or faislon se bharaa padaa tha, lekin apane kuch faislon se unhone daliton ke bich apane liye dher sari sahanubhuti bhi arjeet kii
 Among these, decisions like providing land to Dalits, free education for Dalit girls and inclusion of Paswanas in Mahadalit at the end of their tenure have been very important
 haalanki maanjhi bihar ke iklaute bade dalit netaa nahin hai
 JD (U) has Vidhan Sabha Speaker Uday Narayan Chaudhary, Ministers Shyam Rajak and Ramai Ram while Congress state president Ashok Chaudhary is also a Dalit
 algepi ke mukhiya paswan bhi pichley kai saalon se chunavi khel khelte rahe hai
 But Mahakar's Manjhi has played the cards of Dalit identity and pride very well
 so, aashcharya nahin ki is baar unke hindustan avam morcha-secular (ham-es) or paswan kii algepi ke saath endie ke paas turup kii baaji he
 The consolation is that the BJP leaves about 20 of its 38 reserved seats to its allies
 haalanki bijepi ke liye sabase badi chunauti paswan or maanjhi ke rishton ko sahaj karnaa he
 The BJP is planning to contest elections in about 150 seats out of 243 seats
 endie ke prachaar kaa focus saamaajik shashaktikaran or dalit samudaay ke liye kalyaan kaaryakramon par he
 However, no specific plans have been announced
 dalit votaron kaa rujhaan kidar rahegaa? is sawaal par bijepi ke pravaktaa devesh kumaar puure bharose se kehete hai, ''nitish kumaar ne sirf chunavi phaayde ke liye daliton kaa istemaal kiya he
 He has only distributed, used and humiliated them
 dalit ise bakhubi samajhate hai
 On the other hand, JD (U) is looking forward to Nitish's new attempts to attract Dalits
 party netaaon kaa daawa he ki unhone unki saamaajik-aarthik haalat sudhaarney main kaaphi madad kii he
 According to Bihar Food and Civil Supplies Minister Rajak, Dalits know that Nitish has given them social respect and has tried to benefit them
 ve kehete hai, ''ve nitish kumaar kaa saath kabhi nahin chodenge
 His constituency is Phulwari Sharif, barely seven km from where Rajak sits in the old secretariat of Patna
 yahaan bhi fatehpur or mahakar kii tarah mahadaliton main nitish virdohi bhavanaaen vyapak hai
 Lala Manjhi, 45, a daily laborer from dhibra-shahpur area of the same region, says, "what can you say about a man who serves a plate before you and as soon as you start eating, pull the plate Takes? This is what Nitish Kumar has done
 nitish kumaar ko yah baat pach nahin pai ki koi musahar—chuha khaane vaala or boar charaane vaala—bhala unase zyada lokapriy kaise ho jayega
 "manjhi has never visited Dhibra, but Nitish has reached there
" ve yahaan 15 agast ko dalit basti main tirangaa fahraane gaye the or bhaashan bhi diya tha
 But the Mahadalit residents of Dhibra do not remember that Nitish had ever done anything to improve their condition
 unke dimag main to nitish kii chhavi maanjhi ko baahar nikaalane vaale netaa kii hi he
 In such a situation, how much possibility is there for JD (U) in Phulwari Sharif and how safe is it? "the minister will still win easily," says 57-year-old Ajay Sinha of Rajak in Phulwari Sharif
 hamen ummid he ki yadav, kurmi or musalamaanon ke vot hamen milenge
 i am not sure about the Mahadalit votes
 ''philhal to in voton ko lekar koi aashwast nahin lagata
 The fate of both major alliances still hangs in the balance
 bihar kii uljhan bhari or buree tarah banty hui chunavi raajnneeti main batan dabaate vakt kis samudaay yaa up-jati kaa rukh kis ore rahata he, yah abhi se kaha nahin ja saktaa

" kisi ko bhavishya main phir se aisa kuch karne kii himmat nahin hogi
 "it can be seen in ani's tweet that people are sitting on the shoulder of the Hyderabad Police and congratulating them for the encounter
" telugana encounter par bijepi kii saansad menka gandhi ne kaha ki vahaan jo hua vah bahut bhayanak hua is desh ke liye
 You can't kill people like that
 aap kanoon ko apane haath main nahin le sakate hai
 Maneka Gandhi said that he was an accused and he would have been hanged from court anyway
 unhone kaha ki aisa hone lage to phir phayda kya he kanoon kaa,phayda kya he system kaa
 It is worth noting that on 28 November, these four accused, who were between 20 and 26 years of age, saw the female doctor parked at the toll booth at Scooty Park

 After this incident of rape and murder, there was anger across the country and a Fast Track Court was set up to hear the matter
 australia ke khilaaf tisare vanade match main jab bharat khilne utrega to siries main bane rahane ke liye use haar haal main yah match jeetna hoga
 After the failure of the bowlers in the first two matches, the complete return of the team will now be on the batsmen
 pehle donon maichon main 300 se adhik ran banane ke baavjood haar kaa saamana karne vaali bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ko yah sweekaar karnaa padaa ki gendbaajon ke nahin chal paane ke kaaran unke ballebaajon ko atirikt jimmedaari leni hogi
 This will be India's last chance to keep its hopes in this five-match series
 zimbabwe main jeet ke baad bharat ko pichhali do siries main lagaataar haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 First Bangladesh defeated him on his soil, while South Africa beat India in his home
 iske baad ab bhartiya team agar ravivaar kaa match haar jaati he to yah uski lagaataar teesri siries main haar hogi
 This is certainly a warning bell for Dhoni, as people questioned his leadership after his defeat last year
 yahaan tak kaha gaya ki team ko unke daur se nikalne kii jarurat he
 Dhoni has been consistently losing, however the BCCI reviewed the situation and announced Dhoni to be the limited-overs captain until the 2016 T20 World Cup
 dhoni zimbabwe daure main shaamil nahin the or vaapasi ke baad lagaataar paraajay kaa munh dekh rahe hai
 In such a situation, they will be under pressure to prove that they still have the power to repeat the old record
 nishchit taur par yah kahana jitna aasaan he karnaa utana hi mushkil
 Because their bowlers have so far disappointed with their performance
 brisben main match ke baad unhone is baat kaa zikr kiya ki australia main unke ballebaajon ne lagaataar do maichon main 300 se adhik ran banaae
 Nevertheless, he was defeated
 ghatiya gendbaaji ne kiya nirashadhoni ke tamaam daavon ke baavjood bhi unhen is baat se avgat rahanaa hoga ki agar unke gendbaaj kisi score ko bachaane main kaamyaab nahin hote hai
 So that score doesn't really matter
 sach to ye he ki unke gendbaaj is siries main lagaataar do baar aisa karne main vifal rahe hai
 In such a situation, if the captain asks his batsmen to score 330-340, then it is not a joke
 rohit sharma or viraat kohli shandaar form main najar aa rahe hai lekin unako or jimmedaari uthaane kii jarurat he
 Ajinkya Rahane played a beautiful innings but it was not enough to lead to a good score
 dhoni ne number chaar ke is ballebaaj ke pradarshan kii tarif kii lekin bade shot lagane main unki simit kshamta kii kami kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Due to the very limited opportunities that Manish Pandey has got, it cannot be decided whether Pandey has played his role properly or not
 dhoni, rishi ko nahin denge maukaaise main sawaal ye he ki kya gurkirat maan ko mauka dene se is samasya kaa samaadhaan ho jaayegaa? anubhav kii kami ko dekhte hue kaha ja saktaa he ki jo kaam pandeya ne kiya, thik vahi kaam gurkirat bhi karenge lekin vah kuch overon kii gendbaaji bhi kar sakate hai
 In such a situation, the weight of all five regular bowlers will be less
 lekin bada sawaal yahi he ki kya bharat ke liye sabase upyukt ballebaaji kram yahi he
 Dhoni once again rejected the idea of including Rishi Dhawan in the playing XI
 dhawan kaa ranon kaa sookhaa jaurishikhar dhawan kaa maujuuda form sabake liye chintaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Lack of consistency in the performance of this left-handed opener has increased the concerns of team management and captain Dhoni
 unke kharaab form ko team prabandhan ne ab tak unke bade shot khilne kii kshamta ke kaaran najrandaaj kiya hua he lekin vah kabhi-kabhi hi apane us johar ko dikhaa pate hai
 He has not been able to score a single century in the last 13 matches after a century against Ireland in Hamilton during the World Cup last year
 up-mahadweep main pichley aath maichon main unhone 79
 Strike rate of 91 and just 29
 07 kii ausat se ran banaae hai
 These figures cannot be said to be correct for the performance of a top-order batsman by any means
 bhartiya team ke purv captain saurav ganguli kaa maananaa he ki har praaroop main ek hi tarah ke khilaadiyon ko shaamil kiya janaa chahie taaki team main lay bani rahe or team ke andar aatmavishvaas aae, lekin unke purv saathi vinod kambli bilkul alag raay rakhte hai
 Kambli says that the best player to be reckoned with should be selected from the format
 haal hi main westeindies daure ke liye bhartiya team kaa elaan hua tha or iske baad ganguli ne kaha tha ki teenon praaroop ke liye ek hi tarah kii team chuni jaani chahie
 On team selection, Kambli tweeted, "I believe in selecting players according to the format
 hamen praaroop ke hisaab se sarvshereshth khilaadi chunane chahie or unke saath khelnaa chahie

 Such as Ashish Nehra, Harbhajan Singh and Yuvraj Singh, out of which Nehra has shown his skills well
 har match main jarurat ke samay main team ke liye wicket jatke he
 Although Bhajji did not get a chance to play in the team, Yuvraj Singh got a chance to play in 4 league matches from the team, but the question here is on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni whether he gave him a full chance or he was deliberately ignored 
 khayr, aise sawaal dhoni par pehle bhi uthe hai, lekin is toornament main unhen pehle 3 maichon main gendbaaji karne kaa mauka nahin diya gaya
 The question is whether Dhoni kept him as a surprise element in his further matches, in which he also landed
 unhone pehle hi over kii pehali gend par australian captain steven smith ko apni pehali hi gend par pavilion bhej diya
 Although there is still a question as to whether he was out or not, there are often occasions in cricket when the batsman is not out, but is called out due to benefit of doubt
 uske alaava dekha jaae to unhone badi hi shandaar gendbaazi kii or ballebaazi ke dauraan takhne main dard se jujhate hue batting kar 21 ran banaae joki bahut hi jaruri the, jab team ke australian gendbaazon ke aage 3 wicket gir chuke the
 The comments unhone pakistan ke khilaaf bhi kohli ke saath acchhee sadhi hui saajhedaari kii thi, jisamen unhone 24 ran banaae
 In this tournament, he scored 52 runs and took one wicket for 19 runs in three overs
 agar unhen baaki teen maichon main bhi mauka mila hota to shaayad unke records or achche hote
 Well, now he has been ruled out of the World T20 due to an ankle injury, but now it is to be seen who Dhoni takes in the playing-11, Manish Pandey or Ajinkya Rahane
 haalanki mauka kisi ko bhi mili par ham sab yahi chahenge kii semifinal main west indies ko haraakar bharat tii-20 final main pahunche or jite

 Well, such questions have arisen on Dhoni earlier also, but he was not given a chance to bowl in the first 3 matches in this tournament
 sawaal ye he ki kya dhoni ne unhen apane aage ke maichon main sarprise element ke taur par bachaakar rakhaa tha, jisamen wo khare bhi utre
 He sent the Australian captain Steven Smith to the pavilion on his first ball from the very first ball of the first over
 haalanki abhi bhi sawaal he ki wo out the yaa nahin par cricket main aksar aise maukey dekhe jate he jab ballebaaj out nahin hota he par benifit of dout ke chalate out qaraar diya jaataa he
 Apart from this, he bowled very well and batted with ankle pain during the batting, scoring 21 runs which was very important when the team fell 3 wickets in front of the Australian bowlers
 tippaniyan He also had a good partnership with Kohli against Pakistan, in which he scored 24 runs
 is toornament main unhone 52 ran banaae or teen over main 19 ran dekar ek wicket liya
 If he had got a chance in the remaining three matches too, perhaps his records would have been better
 khayr, ab takhne main chot ke kaaran wo world tii-20 se baahar ho gaye hai, lekin ab dekhnaa hoga ki dhoni plaing-11 main kisko lete hai, manish pandeya yaa ajinkya rahane
 Although the chance is given to anyone, but we all want that India beat the West Indies in the semi-finals and reach the T20 final and win
 uske alaava dekha jaae to unhone badi hi shandaar gendbaazi kii or ballebaazi ke dauraan takhne main dard se jujhate hue batting kar 21 ran banaae joki bahut hi jaruri the, jab team ke australian gendbaazon ke aage 3 wicket gir chuke the

 unhone kaha ‘mujhe lagata tha ki unase (kamini chouhan) sundar mahila jiladhikari nahin ho sakati, par is baar jab main prabharee mantri hum to jiladhikari unase bhi adhik sundar hai

 On completion of 44 years of Emergency, Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan made a comment
 ajam ne kaha ki immergency buree thi, lekin in dinon se behatar thi
 Azam supported Mamata Banerjee's statement and said that the situation is worse than what she has said

 ajam khan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne kaha ki jo log vande maataram nahin kahenge, unhen bharat main rahane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 That is why i am saying that the Emergency was a bad phase, but today's situation forced us to consider Emergency as a better phase

 ab sangh se jude sanghathan logon ko yah bataane main jute hai ki nae chune gaye bijepi ke saansadon kaa pie kis tarah bana jaae
 Such organizations are conducting a week-long course to help mps to get the post of PA, Private Secretary, etc
 darasal, pradhanmantri banane ke turant baad hi narendra modi ne apane sabhi saansadon ko aagaah kar diya tha ki ve apane sage-sambandhiyon ko nijee sachiv na banaaen

 pehle avadh naam se jane jate madhya uttar pradesh ke 15 chunaav kshetron main tisare charan ke matdaan main rajnatik diggajon kii lokapriyata kii pariksha hogi
 On one side in this part of the state, the center of the nehru-gandhi dynasty is Rae Bareli, from where Congress National President Sonia Gandhi is preparing to reach Parliament for the third time, on the other hand, the political legacy of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was the Prime Minister of the country three times
 i also have Lucknow, from where he was elected five times MP, but now BJP has to work hard to retain it
 is charan main dekhnaa he ki kanpur chunaav kshetra kii janata shahar main vikaas ke abhaav, audyogic patan or araajaktaa ke baavjood kya phir kendriya grih mantri shriprakash jaiswal ko chunakar sansad main bhejti he yaa nahin
 This time the election in Rae Bareli will be more interesting than in the earlier elections because it is the same place where two superpower women of current Indian politics have clashed with each other on the issue of development in the region
 sonia kii sthiti ko kamjor karne ke liye mayawati ne yahaan kai baar achaanak bhoomi aavanton radd karke or kai baar unki pariyojnaon ke liye bhoomi kii manjuuri na dekar vikaas kaaryon ko rokane kaa bharpoor prayaas kiya
 Just two hours before Sonia reached the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Rail Coach Factory in Rae Bareli in November last year, the fight between the two leaders took to the streets when Mayawati canceled the allotment of land for her construction
 yahaan tak ki basapa kaary-kartaaon ne bhi hajaaron logon ko rojgaar muhaiyaa karwaane kii sambhaavna vaali rail coach factory kaa kaam rukvane par mayawati kii bhartsana karne main sonia kaa saath diya tha
 The fight between the two was called development versus destruction
 desh bhar main akhabaaron ne mayawati ke kadam kii ninda kii, jinhone janata main asantosh ko bhaanpakar apane hi aadesh ko nirast karke factory ke nirmaan kaa rasta saaf kar diya
 That was not an issue

 Despite this, the people there are determined to ensure the victory of Sonia
 vahaan chunaav kii kaman priyanka wadra gandhi ne sambhalate hue apni maa ko 'puure desh kii chintaa' karne ke liye chhod diya he
 Everyone knows what will be the result of Rae Bareli, but it remains to be seen what the impact of Mayawati's altercation with Sonia here
 lakhanu satta kaa centre or rajya kii rajdhani hone ke kaaran na sirf pratishthit chunaav kshetra he balki ab iskaa mahatv is vajah se he ki yahaan se paanch baar chune gaye vaajapeyi teen baar to pradhanmantri bane the
 Local MLA Lalji Tandon, who was his election manager, is trying to win elections from here in the name of Vajpayee, by repeatedly declaring that he is handling his Ram's 'khadoon'

 But apart from Miss India, her clumsy and extremely objectionable sexist comments about Nafisa, who was a swimming champion, have spoiled her image in the urban public
 unnav ek or sansadeey kshetra he jise lekar congress utsahit he
 Anu Tandon, the fiery candidate here and the wife of an officer of Mukesh Ambani group, came into the limelight due to her pure social activities and hard work

 But Chief Minister Mayawati wants that she should not win because Poonia, who was once a trusted officer, has started challenging her by joining the Congress after her retirement

 The ruling party was expected to increase its numbers in this phase, but due to the way the two national parties are attracting the attention of the BJP and Congress voters, the bsp's weak social engineering does not seem to be effective

 Rajasthan has faced a shocking case in Jodhpur district
 jahaan bal sudhaar grih main band saat bal apradhi guard ko bandhak banaakar faraar ho gaye
 These children had already made an escape plan
 haalanki police ne teji dikhaate hue kuch ghante baad hi paanch bacchon ko pakad liya
 There is a Government Ball Improvement Home in Mandore area of jodhpur district
 jahaan par aparaadhon main lipt bacchon ko rakhaa jaataa he
 There are also some children who have serious charges like murder
 beeti raat kishor bal grih main band saat bacchon ne security guard ko pehle bandhak banaaya or phir vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 The entire incident of his escape was captured in CCTV footage
 jise dekhakar adhikari dang rah gaye
 The children carried out the incident around 2 pm
 raat main sajag rahane ke bajaay bal sudhaar grih kaa security guard aaraam se so rahaa tha
 Then seven children locked there came to the guard and tied him with a rope
 uske baad ve ek ek karke vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 The children who are absconding are between 10 and 16 years old
 soochna milte hipuliceunaki talash main jute gai
 Superintendent of Child Improvement Home BL Saraswat said that the accused children had already planned to flee
 magar un logon ko isaki bhanak nahin lag pai
 The police conducted a three-hour search operation
 jisamen faraar hue saat main se paanch bacchon ko ilaake ke kheton se pakad liya gaya
 ACP Bhopal Singh said that the child had chosen the fields beyond Mandore to hide
 lekin police ne unhen khoj nikaala
 But two children are still on the run, who are being searched
 dilli ke trilokapuri main star sunsity mal ke peeche ek yuvak kii laash milane se sansani fail gai
 The body was found in a park

 The corpse's face was severely crushed
 jisase ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki ravi kii hatya pattharon se petakar kii gai he
 Ravi was missing since Thursday night
 gharavaalon ne isaki shikaayat police se bhi kii thi
 The family members allege that on the call of three of Ravi's friends, he went out to party
 jo waapas ghar nahin aayaa
 After this Ravi's body was found in the park
 police ne pawan, deepak or sonu naam ke teen yuvak ko hiraasat main liya he
 The Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi has now come up with a mega plan for all the slums of Delhi
 dilli sarkaar jhuggivaalon ko makaan banaakar degi, lekin khaas baat ye he ki ye makaan unheen ilaakon main banaae jaaenge, jahaan pehle se jhuggiyaan bani hui hai
 Not only this, the Delhi government has banned the breaking and removal of slums
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke mutabik buudhvaar shaam hui cabinet kii baithak main ye bada faisla liya gaya
 Kejriwal declared that often governments cheat the slum dwellers
 unhen makaan banane kaa bharosa diya jaataa he, lekin puraa nahin hota or banaaya bhi dur ke ilaakon main jaataa he
 However, the Delhi government has decided that now slum dwellers will be given houses
 ye makaan usee ilaake main teen chaar kilometre ke daayre main jameen talashkar banaae jaaenge, jahaan jhuggiyaan bani hui hai
 Obviously, this decision also has the political advantage of the Aam Aadmi Party, because Delhi has a large vote bank of slum dwellers and the party got full support in the last two assembly elections apart from the MCD election
 haalanki jab emsidi main jhuggi waalon kaa vot khiskaa to kejariwal ne jahaan jhuggi vahiin makaan kii ghoshnaa karke phir se jhuggi waalon ko lubhaane kii koshish kii he
 Before this announcement, Arvind Kejriwal also said that the votes he got were not from the rich but because of these slums and the party managed to win 67 seats
 kejariwal ne reword main jhuggivaalon ko is baat kaa bhi bharosa dilaayaa he ki ab unki jhuggiyaan todi nahin jaaengi
 The cabinet has decided that the slums, which were completed before January 2015, will not be destroyed

 The credibility of the members of the Railway Board as well as the members of the electrical and mechanical team are also included in it

 Where is it going among all this? On January 26, a team of experts from South Korea is coming to India

 The concern of Suresh Prabhu, who is also talking to Italy, can be gauged from the fact that despite talking to Japan and South Korea, he has also sought help from Italy

 lekin isse pehle sabaki nazaren hai 23 oktober ko obisi essi / asti ekta manch ke sanyojak alpesh thakor kii ahmedabad main hone vaali raily par
 This rally has been called the 'mandate Conference'
 gujarat ke chunavi ran main obisi voton kaa kitna mahatv he, yah isi se saaf he ki rajya main 54 fisadi obisi yani ati pichde varg kii aabaadi he
 This is the reason why Alpesh is running his bets very cleverly on the election backing
 alpesh kii pehali koshish 23 oktober ko zyada se zyada samarthak juta kar apni takat dikhaane kii he
 Alpesh is claiming that more than 5 lakh people will take part in this rally
 alpesh isi raily main gujarat vidhansabha chunaav ke liye apni ranneeti kii ghoshnaa karenge
 Alpesh has to say that he will leave no stone unturned to defeat the BJP, but there have been many occasions when Alpesh has also been seen entering into an agreement with the BJP government in Gujarat
 aise main philhal yah pakke taur par nahin kaha ja saktaa ki alpesh kii obisi raajnneeti kaa oont kis karavat baithegaa
 In this regard, hints can be given from Alpesh on 23 October
 gujarat kii 25 fisadi aabaadi patidaar or daliton kii he40 varshiya alpesh obisi voton ko apane peeche ekajute bataakar zyada se zyada phayda uthaane ke liye raajnneetik saudebaaji kii line par chal rahe hai
 Not only this, he is also trying to keep pace with two more young leaders - Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani - who have emerged on the political scene of Gujarat recently
 23 hardik patel patidaar anamat andolan samiti ke sanyojak hai, vahiin 37 varshiya jignesh mewaani rashtriya dalit adhikaar manch kii aguai kar rahe hai
 Patidars constitute 18% and Dalits 7% in Gujarat
 alpesh or hardik donon hi ahmedabad ke viramgaanv ke rahane vaale hai
 Both are said to have good identity among themselves
 hardik, alpesh or jignesh ke aapasi matbheelpesh, hardik or jignesh kaa daawa he ki teenon milakar gujarat kii 120 siton par kisi bhi party ko haraane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 All three are talking about solidarity, but they have contradictions among themselves about ideology
 hardik patel seenaa thok kar kehete hai ki unhen kisi bhi keemat par patidaaron ke liye aarakshan chahie, chaahe vah alag se aae yaa obisi cote se
 Alpesh does not give any direct answer to this demand of Hardik
 alpesh ke mutabik patidaaron ko aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan milanaa chahie, lekin obisi aarakshan par iskaa koi asar nahin padana chahie
 Jignesh also says the same thing
 wo bhi kehete hai ki daliton ke aarakshan se koi chhedchhad nahin honi chahie
 In such a situation, it is difficult to say how long this youth will stay together for a long time
 hairaani kii baat he ki jaat-paat se dur jis gujarat ke vikaas model kii duhai desh bhar main di jaati thi, vahi gujarat ab vidhansabha chunaav se pehle jatiyon ke khaanche main saaf banta dikh rahaa he
 Be it Alpesh Thakor or Hardik Patel or Jignesh Mevani, all three have managed to make their presence felt on the political platform of Gujarat
 congress, bijepi ke mat pratishat main maatr 9 fisadi kaa antar2012 vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko 47
 9% and 38 to Congress
 9% vot share mila tha
 There was a 9% difference in the votes of the two parties
 alpesh kii koshish yahi dikhaane kii he ki vah hardik or jignesh ke saath mil kar siyaasi palada kisi ke bhi paksh main jhukaane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 It is difficult to say how much of Alpesh's claims regarding the support of OBC votes, but this political development has certainly increased the lines of concern on the foreheads of BJP, including Chief Minister Vijay Rupani
 thakor sena se alpesh ne banaai pahachanie ab alpesh ke ateet par najar daudaate hai ki kaise ve aisi majboot sthiti main aa gaye ki gujarat ke do mukhya raajnneetik dalon ko unke har kadam par najar rakhni pad rahi he
 Alpesh was identified with the Thakore Army three years before the OBC-SC / ST Ekta Manch
 alpesh ne gujarat main sharabbandi ke baavjood har jagah aasaani se milane vaali desi sharaab ko bada mudda banaaya
 The Thakor army, led by Alpesh, started 'janata Raid' at local liquor stores in central and north Gujarat
 alpesh kaa kahana he ki desi sharaab ke jehar se sabase zyada thakor yuva hi barbaad ho rahe hai
 Alpesh also took up the issue of unemployment of a large number of youths in Gujarat with the de-addiction campaign
 alpesh ne saath hi thakor sena kaa dayera badhaate hue puure obisi samaaj ko bhi isamen jod diya
 There are 146 castes of OBC society in Gujarat
 diggaj netaaon ke saath kaam kar chuke hai alpesh ke pittalpesh ke parivaar kii baat kii jaae to unke pita khodaji thakor kisi vakt bijepi ke sanghathan ke liye kaam kiya karte the
 Khodaji Thakor worked with Shankar Singh Vaghela, Narendra Modi, Anandiben Patel at a time when these leaders also looked after the work of the party organization
 shankar singh waghela ne jab bijepi se alag raah chuni to khodaji thakor bhi unke saath ho gaye
 When Shankar Singh Vaghela formed the Shaktidal, Alpesh Thakor was made the convenor of his youth wing
 waghela jab congress ke saath jude to khodaji or alpesh bhi unke saath congress se jud gaye
 Alpesh had also contested for Model Panchayat in Ahmedabad district as a youth leader, but Alpesh lost the election
 teen saal pehle thakor samaaj ke liye movement chalaane kii baat uthi to khodaji thakor ne yah jimmedaari uthaate hue apane bete ko aage kiya
 In this way the movement of Thakor army stood up
 hardik satta-virdohi jabaki alpesh congress ke karibraajnneetik jaankaar prashanth dayaal, hardik patel or alpesh thakor kaa antar bataate hai
 According to Prashant Dayal, Hardik's stance is clear that he is anti-government, whose advantage seems to be Congress softness
 prashanth dayaal kaa kahana he ki yahi baat alpesh thakor ke liye pakke taur par nahin kahi ja sakati ki wo congress ke saath jaaenge yaa nahin
 Political experts also say that just as Alpesh has raised the problems of de-addiction, unemployment, farmers' debt and against the government in the last 3 years, he has created dissatisfaction by playing bugle, so if he goes with BJP then Supporters may find it overwhelming to answer them
 jaankaar aise main alpesh ke congress ke saath jane kii hi zyada sambhaavna jataa rahe hai
 However, now we have to see what leaves Alpesh open on 23 October
 jammu-kashmir main taaja sthiti ko dekhte hue chunaav ayog ne 25 may ko hone vaale anantnag loksabhaa upachunaav ko radd kar diya he
 The Election Commission has said that the situation is not right for the elections in the Valley
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle 12 april ko anantnag ko chunaav hone the, lekin hinsa ke baad unhen taal diya gaya tha
 Apart from this, it is being told that this election has also been canceled due to lack of security forces
 chunaav ayog jald hi nai taarikh kaa elaan karegaa
 It is worth mentioning that the Election Commission had sought 74,000 paramilitary personnel from the Center, which was a very large number, for the deployment of the Anantnag Lok Sabha seat in Jammu and Kashmir
 chunaav ayog ne grih mantralay ko is baat se avgat karaayaa he ki ardhsainik bal kii 740 companiyaan 12 may tak uske adhikaar main di jaaen
 Significantly, a company has about 100 paramilitary personnel

 sarkaar agle hafte sambhavat: mangalvaar ko jiesti bill ko rajyasabha main pesh kar sakati he
 There have been speculations about this bill for quite some time
 sarkaar or vipaksh ke bich iske praavdhaanon ko lekar lambii jaddojahad chali he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a strategic meeting on this matter with senior ministers on Friday night
 pichley kuch hafton ke dauraan vitt mantri arun jetali ne jiesti ke mudde par mukhya vipakshi party congress ko manaane main khub mehnat kii he
 Jaitley has also held talks with state governments and regional parties during this period and it is expected that the government will get his support on GST
 arun jetali ne shuukravaar ko patrakaron se baat karte hue kaha, 'ham is maamle main ashavan hai
 He indicated that the government has managed to get a two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha to get the bill passed
 jiesti ko kanoonee shakl dene liye sarkaar ko samvidhan main sanshodhan bhi karnaa padegaa
 30 out of 32 parties in the Rajya Sabha are now supporting the GST bill
 sarkaar ne vastuon kaa utpaadan karne vaale rajyon kii bharpai ke liye duusare rajyon kii simaaon ko paar karne par lagane vaale tex ko ek fisad kam karke kuch had tak congress ko bhi khush karne kii koshish kii he
 After the constitutional amendment, the government will have to pass the GST bill
 jisamen tex kii dar or vah adhikttam seemaa, jisase zyada tex nahin liya ja saktaa sab shaamil kiya jayega
 The Finance Minister believes that a single tax (GST) at the national level, rather than separate taxes at the Center and the states, would give wings to India's economic growth and could rise to two per cent

 In such a situation, even if the Congress votes against the government with its 60 mps, the government will easily pass the bill
 haalanki sarkaar chaahegi ki congress bhi jiesti par uskaa samarthan kare, taaki sadan bina kisi shor sharabe ke chalata rahe

 isse bhi sarkaar ko jiesti paas karaane main madad hi milegi

 However this will be decided on the basis of interaction with the state governments (GST Council)
 agar sarkaar ko jiesti bill ko lekar safalataa milti he to iske saath jo aarthik sudhaaron ko gati milegi usase niveshak khush honge

 samvidhan sanshodhan ke baad sarkaar ko jiesti bill paas karwaanaa hoga
 Which will include the tax rate and the maximum limit by which not much tax can be levied
 vitt mantri kaa maananaa he ki centre or rajyon ke alag-alag taxon kii bajaay rashtriya str par ek tex (jiesti) se bharat kii aarthik vikaas ko pankh lagenge or yah do fisadi tak bad saktaa he
 The constitutional amendment to bring GST has been passed by the government in the Lok Sabha
 bataa den ki loksabhaa main sarkaar ke paas purna bahumat hasil he
 The Rajya Sabha currently has 243 members, while two seats are vacant
 sarkaar ko rajyasabha main bill paas karaane ke liye do tihaai bahumat yaa 162 mat chahie
 Apart from the ruling parties of the ruling BJP and NDA at the center, the BJP has a majority with the support of regional parties
 aise main agar congress apane 60 saansadon ke saath sarkaar ke khilaaf vot karti he to bhi sarkaar aasaani se bill paas kara legi
 However, the government would like Congress to support it on GST, so that the House can run without any noise
 agar sadan main congress ne hangaamaa kiya to sarkaar ko bill sadan main rakhane or voting karaane main dikkat pesh aegi
 Jayalalithaa's party in power in Tamil Nadu AIADMK has 13 mps in the Rajya Sabha and the party is opposing GST
 centre sarkaar ko ummid he ki jayalalita kii party rajya main apane samarthakon ko khush karne ke liye jiesti ke virodh main sadan se walkout karegi
 This will also help the government to pass GST
 tippaniyan Congress says that the tax rate in GST should not be more than 17 percent
 haalanki yah rajya sarkaron (jiesti council) se baatcheet ke aadhaar par tay hoga
 If the government gets success on the GST bill, then investors will be happy with the economic reforms that will accelerate it

 bollywood kii jaani-maani actress kangana ranut ne kaha he ki rithik roshan bollywood industry ke vibhinn logon ke paas gaye or unka kariyar tabah karne kii koshish kii
 There has been a time of accusation between them
 isaki shuruyaat tab hui thi jab kangana ne ek intervyuu main rithik ko eks bataaya or kaha ki rithik atension paane ke liye unke aage peeche ghoomte the
 Later, the matter grew so much that both of them also sent legal notices to each other
 is dauraan kangana ke email bhi saarvajanik ho gaye
 The matter reached the police
 ab ek intervyuu main kangana ne kaha he ki do logon ke privet afaire main koitisraa vyaktimadad nahin kar saktaa tha
 Kangana said- 'I used to get a call from people that Hrithik had met them and showed evidence against me
 saamne vaala shaks mujhe milane or apana paksh rakhane ke liye kahata tha
 But i used to answer that this is not your business
 'isse pehle, 'aaj tak' se ek khaas baatcheet main kangana ne kaha-film industry main agar dostabanaayenge to maamla kahin naa kahin complicated ho jayega
 If you become successful in the industry with whom you are working, then you will start to avoid them

 Anurag Thakur, Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), on 10 June at 10 am
 30 baje apni diary main darj kuch nots ke saath dilli, mumbai, kolkata or hyderabad main conference kol ke jariye bhartiya cricket kii paheli ko sulajhane baithe
 The experience of 1,307 international matches was collected in a single committee in an hour i
e
 a small committee of nobles or a council of feudals like the old times
 bhartiya cricket kii chaar sabase charchit shakhsiyaton main se teen—sachin tendulkar, saurabh ganguli or ve
 V
 es
 Laxman — has now been formally made a member of the new Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) of the BCCI, which is to take up the 'responsibility to make Indian cricket better'
 haalanki bhartiya cricket kii paheliyon main se abhi ek hi sulajhi he
 The rest is yet to be solved
 7 june se shuru hone vaale bangladesh daure ke liye koching or sahaayak staff ke maamle ko ab bhi antim rup nahin diya ja sakaa tha or bhartiya team ke bich lokapriy team diarector ravi shastri kuch karne ke mood main nahin the
 Shastri, 53, was insisting that he be given this responsibility for the T20 World Cup next year, otherwise he is not interested in it at all
 thakur uske baad phir din bhar phone-phan karte rahe
 Shastri finally agreed to catch a Bangladesh plane late on Monday night but he was not given any further assurance
 tufaan kisi tarah tal gaya or us raat bisisiai ke suurama chaiyn kii neend so paae
 But are there signs of a big storm as well? With the matter of the role and rights of the CAC becoming clear, it seemed as if the cricket board's short-sightedness had started reopening? Or is it just an example of the board losing another chance to improve the management of the cricket team? Unfortunately the answers to these questions do not generate enthusiasm at all
 aaj bhartiya cricket kii haalat yah he ki yuva or shaayad ati aakraamak test captain viraat kohli ek nihaayat nai team ke saath jujh rahe hai, jiske paas anubhav kii kami he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of ODI and T20 matches, is feeling the lack of new energy on the slope of his career
 team main koi sthaayee coach nahin he or 2015 valrd cap main semifinal tak pahunchane ke baavjood videshi dharti par uskaa pradarshan kaaphi lachar rahaa he
 At such a time, when the CAC members sit in Kolkata on June 6, the Indian cricket fans will be expected to spread the magic they have shown on the field in their time
 lekin, kya koi salaahkaar kii bhoomika vaali samiti vaaki kuch anokhaa kar paaegi, jiskaa na team par niyantran he, na chayan yaa prashikshan main dakhsandaji kaa koi adhikaar he?darasal, siesi ko team kii jimmedaari or captain, coach tathaa chayankartaaon ke pradarshan kii nigaraanee ke adhikaar dene ke badale, lagata he, bisisiai ne ek or dantaheen samiti bana daali he, jiskaa kaam sirf sachiv or adhyaksh ko apni siforeeshon kii report saunp kar mukt ho janaa he
 After that they will do whatever they want
 samiti ko vaastavik adhikaar na dene kaa bisisiai kaa yah kadam aage chalakar ek or bemaani harakat ke rup main hi gina ja saktaa he
 Above all, it seems that the board does not want to loose control over the team in any way
 bisisiai 1928 main apane gathan se hi bhartiya cricket par bharpoor niyantran rakhata aayaa he
 Its chief officer has always kept all kinds of reins in his hands
 spancership or tivi prasaaran ke saudon se lekar anudaan tathaa khel suvidhaon ke vikaas, maichon ko tay karne or manageron kii niyukti ke alaava team ke chayankartaaon, captain tathaa yahaan tak ki khiladinnon ke chayan kii kaman bhi apane haath main rakhte aae hai
 For the first time when the cac's talk came up, speculation started that Saurabh could be made the team's coach or team director for a long time, then it seemed that the board, embroiled in the fixing and corruption allegations for the last few years, now has some fresh start
 Is supposed to aisa laga ki bhartiya cricket ke svarnim daur ke sitaron ko kuch adhikaar dekar khelon main kam se kam cricket ke maamle ko kuch peshevraana rup dene kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 In fact, the BCCI is at the highest end of the system below which the captain, coach and selectors are the team
 kathith taur par shuru main thakur ne siesi ke gathan ke vichaar ko aage badhaayaa, ek aisi ikai jo cricket se jude saare maamle dekhe, coach or captain se sidhe sampark main rahe
 But this advice was immediately rejected
 itnaa hi nahin, bisisiai ke andruni sutara to yahaan tak bataate hai ki siesi maanad samiti kii tarah hi kaam karegi
 This means that no money will be given to the members and thus there will be no accountability
 maa mala jab saaf hone laga to cricket jagat main ummiden bhi baithne lageen
 The role assigned to CAC is limited
 bisisiai ke adhikariyon ke mutabik samiti ke sadsy ''bhartiya cricket ke chaitarafa vikaas se sambandhit apana najariya muhaiyaa karaayenge'' or ham dekhenge ki ''bhartiya cricket ko bulandi dilaane main kaise unke kaushal kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 "there has also been a talk in the BCCI that the members of the CAC should be sent in turn in important tours
 lekin bhartiya team ke purv khilaadi madan laal jaise kai log afsos jataate hai ki siesi ko adhik sakriy bhoomika nahin di gai he
 He says, "it is a good thing to put these three great players in the work of Indian cricket
 lekin agar team par unka niyantran rahata to behatar hota
 i do not mean to interfere in the selection or coaching, but i believe that the selectors and coaches should be made accountable to them
 ''saurabh or sachin to tippanee ke liye uplabdh nahin ho paae lekin lakshmana se sampark karne par unhone kaha, ''main bhartiya cricket ko apni puri jaankaree duungaa, jaisaa main apane daur main khelte vakt detaa rahaa hum
 "there has been speculation about another member of the CAC before
 ve chaar sabase charchit khiladinnon main rahul dravid hai
 He was first asked whether he would like to become the head coach and then, that he would like to become a member of the CAC? The gentle Dravid turned down both offers very politely
 unhone kaha ki unhen under-19 or india e team par hi kaaphi kaam karnaa he, bade khilaadi to baad main aate hai
 What is a CAC drum show? Board President Jagmohan Dalmiya denied this question
 unka jawaab tha, ''nahin to
 The BCCI will try to implement their recommendations completely
 '' kya shbhartiya cricket kii madadya kii bhoomika ke saath siesi kaa anil kumble kii aguai vaali takneekee samiti se takaraav to nahin hoga? anuraag thakur kaa jawaab he, ''takneekee samiti gharelu cricket ke maamle dekhati he jabaki siesi kii badi bhoomika he
 Ultimately, everyone works only for the betterment of Indian cricket, but everyone's role is different
 '' baharhaal, bisisiai kaa maamla ho or pechida, ulajhaau na ho, aisa bhala kaise ho saktaa he? Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has asked his openers Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma to take more responsibility after the 15-run defeat in the second ODI at the hands of New Zealand on Wednesday
 siries main lagaataar duusari haar ke saath australia ke haathon duniya kii number ek team kii ranking ganvaane ke baad dhoni ne kaha, jab hamaare salaami ballebaajon kii baat aati he to ve pehle 10 over khel lete hai
 But i think it is important that they play 10 to 15 overs more, so that after 22 to 25 overs, we can score faster
 lekin hameshaa sab kuch yojana ke mutabik nahin hota
 Significantly, the reason for India's defeat in the second ODI was again the poor performance of the top-order batsmen
 shikhar dhawan ne 22 gendon par 12 ran banaae jabaki duusare openar 34 gend par 20 ran hi bana sake
 By the time the team had scored 37 runs in the tenth over, both these pavilions had traveled
 gauratlab he ki duusare vanade main bharat ne dakworth louis methd ke anusaar 42 over main 297 ran ke sanshodhit lakshya kaa peechha karte hue newjiland ko kadi takkar di, lekin jeet darj nahin kar sakaa
 Team India 41 when the match ended due to rain
 3 over main nau wicket par 277 ran hi bana pai thi
 41 According to Duckworth Lewis
 3 over main bharat ko jeet ke liye 293 ran chahie the
 India once again lacked a big partnership, due to which it has been facing troubles for some time
 mejabaan team ke gendbaajon ne jatke diedhoni ne kaha, pichley match main main out ho gaya or isamen viraat out ho gaya
 It is important that the partnership be carried forward, because it is difficult for a new player to play open shots
 dhoni ne newjiland ke gendbaajon kii tarif karte hue kaha ki jab bhi lag rahaa tha ki bharat lakshya hasil karne kii sthiti main he, tab mejabaan team ke gendbaajon ne unhen jatke die
 He said that when New Zealand fast bowlers bowl slow balls, it is difficult to play big shots on them
 behtareen form main chal rahe viraat jaise khilaadi ko bhi lagaataar shaat khilne main dikkat ho rahi thi
 Shami was specially praised by the Indian bowlers for the second consecutive match, but Dhoni supported his fast bowlers
 unhone tej gendbaaj mohammad shami kii vishesh taur par tarif kii
 He said, the fast bowlers did well for us
 deth overon main bhubaneshwar kumaar ne acchhee gendbaaji kii, jabaki shami lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Dhoni said that we gave some extra runs but given his big hitter it can be expected as he can score 10 to 20 extra runs
 ab oakland main milengebrish ke vyavdhaan ke baad sanshodhit lakshya ke bare main poochne par dhoni ne kaha, mujhe hameshaa se lagata he ki simit overon ke match main agar over kam kar die jaaen to baad main ballebaaji karne vaali team ke liye behatar hota he kyonki use lakshya pataa hota he or kya karnaa he yah bhi
 But if around 10 overs are reduced then we know that the team batting later has a loss
 bhartiya team ab 25 janvari ko aaisland main teesraa vanade match khelegi, jo dhoni kii team ke liye karo yaa maro jaisaa match hoga

 mumbai main teen jagahon par visphoton ke kuch din baad congress netaa gurudaas kaamat ne aarope lagaaya he ki maharashtra sarkaar ne 26 / 11 ke aatankwaadi hamalon ke baad koi sabak nahin liya or jaruri saavdhaaniyaan nahin baratin
 Kamat, who visited his Mumbai North West parliamentary constituency for the first time on Saturday night after his resignation from the Union Cabinet, blamed the state government for not taking lessons from the 26 November 2008 terrorist attacks in the metropolis
 unhone kaha, ‘pichley hafte visphot rajya sarkaar, police or khufia agenciyon kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se hue
 Kamat said, "had 5,000 CCTV cameras been installed in different parts of Mumbai, there would not have been bombings in Oprah House, Jhaveri Bazaar and Dadar in the past
 ’unhone kaha, ‘november 2008 ke aatankwaadi hamalon ke baad suraksha badhaane ke liye sarkaar ko sakht kadam uthaane chahie the
 But the government did not take a lesson and take necessary precautions
 ’ kaamat ne yah bhi kaha ki rajya sarkaar gashti ke liye naukaaen kharidne or tateey police thanon ke nirmaan main bhi vifal rahi he

 baayen haath ke ballebaaj suresh raina ne bhale hi apane test kariyar ke shuruaati test main shatak lagaakar bada dhamaakaa kiya tha, lekin unhen test cricket ke bajaay shorter formet kaa behtareen khilaadi mana jaataa he
 Born in Ghaziabad, UP, Suresh Raina can be considered an 'asset' for any team due to his cricketing skills
 apane jabardast ballebaaji se ve kisi bhi gendbaaji akraman kii dhajjiyaan bikharane main sakasham hai
 Suresh is a batsman who can run fast between wickets and in addition to scoring runs, he can also hit long sixes when needed
 kshetrarakshan ke maamle main bhi unka koi sani nahin hai
 At present, Raina can be considered as one of the most fit fielders of Team India
 yahi nahin, apni of spin gendbaaji se bhi raina ranon par ankush lagane ke saath wicket jhatakate hai
 Raina has the distinction of being the first Indian player to score a century in all three formats of cricket (test, ODI and T20)
 suresh raina ke naam ke saath ek or rochak tathy judaa he
 Despite scoring a century in his debut match in Test cricket, he is out of this form of cricket, despite being dismissed for zero in his first ODI, he is considered a 'valuable player' of this format
 haalanki haal ke samay kamjor pradarshan kaaran unhen kuch samay vanade team se bhi baahar baithna padaa he
 Talking about Test cricket, his batting technique is questioned against the balls coming out of the off stump and against the bouncers
 duusari ore, apane pehle vanade mukaable main raina srilanka ke khilaaf raina bina koi ran banaakar out ho gaye the
 The comments suresh raina ko acha netritvkarta bhi mana jaataa he
 He has also captained Team India in some odis
 ipel main lambey samay tak chennai superkings team main mahendra singh dhoni ke khaas sipahasaalar raina pichley sijan main gujarat liance ke captain the
 His leadership was impressed by the Gujarat Lions team's brilliant performance in the first season itself
 varsh 2005 main srilanka ke khilaaf dambula main vanade kariyar kaa aagaaj karne vaale raina ne ab tak 223 maichon main 35
 5568 runs at an average of 46 (strike rate 93
 76) banaae hai jisamen paanch shatak shaamil hai
 Not only this, he has taken 36 wickets and 100 catches in this format, showing his skill in bowling and fielding too
 desh ke liye 62 tii20 match khelte hue is khabbu ballebaaj ne 29
 1203 runs at an average of 34 (strike rate 132)
 92)banaae hai jisamen ek shatak shaamil hai
 12 wickets in T20 are also recorded in his name
 test cricket kaa pradarshan jarur unki pratibha se nyaay karata najar nahin aata
 Raina has 26 from 18 matches so far
 48 ke ausat se 768 ran banaae hai jisamen ek shatak shaamil he
 Raina, who turned 30 on Sunday, still has a lot of cricket left
 ummid he ki ve cricket ke teenon formet ke niyamit sadsy banakar bhartiya cricket or apane pradarshan ko or behatar banane main safal rahenge
 
 suresh aise ballebaaj hai jo wicket ke bich teji se daud lagaakar ran banane ke alaava jarurat padane par lambey chakke bhi laga sakate hai
 He has no match even in the field of fielding
 maujuuda samay main raina ko team india ke sabase chust-durust fielderon main shumaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Not only this, Raina also takes wickets with his off-spin bowling to curb runs
 raina ko desh ke ek pehle bhartiya khilaadi hone kaa gaurav hasil he jisane cricket ke teenon formet (test, vanade or tii20) main shatak lagaae hai
 Another interesting fact is associated with Suresh Raina's name
 test cricket main apane debyue match main shatak jamaane ke baavjood ve is forment ke cricket se baahar hai jabaki apane pehle vanade main shunya par out hone ke baavjood unhen is formet kaa 'beshkeemtee khilaadi' mana jaataa he
 However, due to poor performance in recent times, he has had to sit out of the ODI team for some time
 test cricket ke lihaaj se baat karen to of stump ke baahar nikalati gendon or bounsar ke khilaaf unki ballebaaji takanic par sawaal khadey kiye jate hai
 On the other hand, Raina was out in his first ODI against Sri Lanka without scoring any runs
 tippaniyan Suresh Raina is also considered a good leader
 ve kuch vanade maichon main team india kii captaini bhi kar chuke hai
 Raina, the special captain of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the Chennai Super Kings team for a long time in the IPL, was the captain of Gujarat Lions last season
 unke netritv ko gujarat liance team ne pehle sijan main hi shandaar pradarshan se har kisi ko prabhavit kiya tha
 Raina, who made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in Dambulla in 2005, has scored 35 in 223 matches so far
 46 ke ausat se 5568 ran (strike rate 93
 76) have scored five centuries
 yahi nahin, gendbaaji or fielding main bhi kushalta kaa hone kaa parichay dete hue ve is fomet main 36 wicket or 100 kaich le chuke hai
 The 29-year-old batsman played 29 T20 matches for the country
 34 ke ausat se 1203 ran (strike rate 132
 92) have scored a century
 tii20 main 12 wicket bhi unke naam par darj hai
 Test cricket is not judged by his talent
 raina ne ab tak 18 maichon main 26
 He has scored 768 runs at an average of 48 including a century
 ravivaar ko hi 30 varsh ke hue raina main abhi kaaphi cricket baaki he
 It is expected that he will be able to improve Indian cricket and his performance further by becoming a regular member of all three formats of cricket

 The Cabinet has approved the Criminal Law Amendment Bill to prevent crimes against women
 isse pehle sahmati se sex kii umr 18 saal se ghataakar 16 saal karne par mantri samooh main ek raay ban gai thi
 Age of sex with consent was increased to 16, GOM had recommended reducing the age of sex from 18 years to 16 years with consent
 bal evam mahila vikaas mantralay ko is par khaas etraz tha
 Instead of sexual harassment, the word rape will be used in the bill, that means the victim will be a woman in every case
 ye maang khaas taur par mahila sanghathanon kii thi
 In addition, issues such as stalking and eavesdropping have been brought under the purview of non-bailable offenses
 is maamle main juthi shikaayat hone par sajaa kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 This country wants women to feel safe
 lekin is ehsaas ke liye kisi ke kilaaf kisi ko kya antaheen adhikaar die ja sakate hai?yah sawaal isliye bhi uth rahe hai, kyonki
 
 
 - Can not get married in 16 years but will be able to have a relationship
 shaadi kii umr ladakon ke liye 21 saal he
 Leave the marriage, in 16 years, you cannot even see an adult category film but can make a relationship
 - 16 saal main sharaab nahin pi sakate lekin shaareerik sambandh bana sakate hai
 How much punishment is there in the anti-rape law passed by the group of ministers: - Life imprisonment for rape
 - tezaab phenkane par umr kaid
 - Life imprisonment on minor to rape
 lekin jo haahaakaari he wo ye ki is kanoon main zyaadaatar gunahon ko gairazmaanti bana diya gaya he
 - To stare would be non-bailable
 - peechha karnaa gaiyr jamaanti aparaadh kii shrenee main hoga
 - It is also illegal to stare at a woman
 - agar baar-baar chhintakashi kii to wo bhi gairazmaanti
 - Meaning if a man is stuck in a traffic jam and accidentally his car is behind a woman's car, then the woman can accuse him of stalking and he will not get bail
 - isi tarah aap kisi mahila ko pahchaanane kii koshish kar rahe hon or mahila ko ye pasand na aae to wo use 100 number dial karke andar kara sakati he
 - If a man, while working, sees a woman from time to time, then he is a partner of non-bailable offense
 or police ke liye mahila kaa bayaan aakiri hoga
 - The extent is that if the woman turns out to be false, then no action will be taken against her

 ) Mother of Sheetla fasting falls on saptami-ashtami of Krishna Paksha of Chaitra month
 shastron ke anusaar is puja kaa bahut mahatv hota he or ise karne se ghar rogon se dur rahata he
 According to Skandpuran, there is a law to observe this fast in four months
 is vrath par ek din pehle banaaya hua bhojan kiya jaataa he
 Hence it is also called Basoda, Lassoura or Basiaura
 kyon manaate hai basauda parv?basauda, sheetaltaa kaa parv bhartiya sanathan parampara ke anusaaramhilaayein apane bacchon kii salaamati, aarogytav ghar main sukh-shanti ke liye rangapanchami se ashtami tak maa sheetala ko basauda banaakar puujati hai
 In Basoda, sweet rice, kadhi, gram dal, halwa, rabri, puri without salt, poo etc
 are prepared in the night before one day
 subah ghar va mandir main mata kii puja-archana kar mahilaayein sheetala mata ko basauda kaa prasad chadhaati hai
 After performing the puja, the women of the house divide Basoda's Prasad into their family and meet with everyone and take stale food and take the blessings of the mother
 basauda parv kii puranic kathakinvadantiyon ke anusaar basauda kii puja mata sheetala ko prasann karne ke liye kii jaati he
 It is said that once the villagers were worshiping Shitla Mata in a village and the villagers offered the senior food to the mother as a offering
 sheetaltaa kii pratimurti maa bhavani kaa munh garm bhojan se jal gaya or ve naaraaz ho gayi
 He set the entire village on fire with a blind eye
 bas keval ek budhiya kaa ghar surakshit bachaa hua tha
 When the villagers went and asked the old lady about not burning the house, the old lady said that she was feeding her senior food to mother Shitla and said that she cooked food at night and fed the mother cold-stale food in the bhog
 jisase maa ne prasann hokar budhiya kaa ghar jalane se bachaa liya
 On hearing the old woman, the villagers apologized to the mother and worshiped the mother's basoda by feeding them stale food on the seventh day after Rangpanchami
 sheetala mata kaa vrath kaise karen?- vrati ko is din praatavkalin nity karmon se nivrutt hokar svachh va sheethal jal se snaan karnaa chahie
 - After bathing, 'mama Gaye Sheetalograjnitopadrava prasanam pre-kayurarogyaishyavarvidhvidhyaye' should be resolved with the mantra 'sheetlashtami fasting
 - sankalp ke baad vidhi-vidhaan tathaa sugandhyukt gandh va pushp aadi se mata sheetala kaa pujan karen
 After this, eat (stale) food, nuts, sweets, pooas, pooris etc
 a day before
 - yadi aap chaturmaasi vrath kar rahe ho to bhoga main maah ke anusaar bhoga lagaaein, jaise- caitra main sheethal padaarth, baishakh main ghi or meetha sattu, jyeshtha main ek din purv banaae gaye pue tathaa asadha main ghi or shakkar mili hui kheer
 - After offering bhog, read the Sheetla Stotra and if it is not available, listen to the story of Sheetla Ashtami
 - raatri main jagaraata karen or deepamalaen prajjwalit karen
 Special: On this day, a fast should not be consumed by anyone and any member of the family
 is vrath ke liye ek din purv hi bhojan banaakar rakh len tathaa use hi grahan karen
 These days Congressmen are talking about the silence of Niyamgiri Hills lobby
 rahul gandhi or unke sur main sur milaane vaale kendriya gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh donon hi koyala ghotaale main pradhanmantri kaa bachaav karne main jaahir taur par ekadam khamosh hai
 Could it be that both Rahul and Ramesh would disagree with the apparent looting of natural resources in this way? Or is it that both are angry that the cabinet has sent the Rahul's trophy ie Land Acquisition Bill prepared by Ramesh to the Group of Ministers
 congress ne aaj dilli ke liye apana ghoshnaptr jari kar diya
 However, according to the party, this manifesto is Part One, that is, another part of it is yet to come
 philhal is ghoshnaptr main dilli ke garibon ko lubhaane ke liye kaaphi kuch he
 Ajay Maken, the head of the Congress Campaign Committee in Delhi, said that we are not talking about the Red Fort and Qutub Minar
 ham vahi vaade kar rahe hai jo puraa karenge
 We have long experience and this manifesto has been prepared on that basis
 sirf kya denge usee kii baat nahin, kaise karenge uskaa zikr bhi he
 The Congress presented its manifesto in the presence of PC Chacko, Ajay Maken, Arvinder Singh Lovely and other top leaders of Delhi
 sasti bijli, sasta anaaj, buzurgon ko pension, nae skool, pakki naukari sab iske ghoshnaatr main shaamil dikhe
 According to this manifesto, if the Congress came to power dilli pradesh adhyaksh arvinder singh lavali kehete hai ki yah mahaj ghoshnaptr nahin unke liye ye ramayana or quran jaisaa pavitra he
 Will do what is written
 beete saal ke pehle dilli main congress 15 saal sarkaar chalaati rahi, lekin pichley chunaav main uski karaari haar hui
 Now the big question is from where will she bring the agenda of AAP and BJP
