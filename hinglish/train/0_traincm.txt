 # instabolly # bebobolly # bollywooda post shared bybollywood Entertainment🌼(@lnstabolly) onjun 21, 2018 at 8:52am PDT a photo of three women is going viral on Facebook
 upree taur par agar dekhen to yah photo bahut saamaanya he, lekin ek khaas kaaran se ise kaaphi share kiya ja rahaa he
 In fact, there is a lot of craze about whiteness in Indian society and black people also have to face discrimination
 zyaadaatar branding poster main bhi sirf gore chehre dikhaai dete hai
 In such a situation, when people shared this photo from the facebook page named The Uncanny Truth Teller 2, people noticed it a lot
 photo ke capshan ke saath likhaa gaya- The Faces of India they won't show you
 That is, the face of India that those people will not show you
 39 hajaar baar logon ne kiya shereis photo main teen mahilaayein selfi le rahi hai
 However, it is not clear whether these photos are from Indian women or elsewhere
 is photo ko ab tak 39 hajaar baar share kiya gaya he
 The women in photos are in saris and are also wearing many ornaments
 kai logon ne is photo ko behad khubasurat bataaya he or likhaa he ki yah tasviir hajaaron shabd bayaan kar rahi he

 Speaking at different venues and events, Obama and Bush warned that America was slipping between past hatreds that should have been buried long before history

 This is the 21st century, not the 19th

 bush ne kaha ki aise sanket mil rahe hai, khaskar yuvaaon main, jisase pataa chalata he ki loktantr ke prati gahan bhaavana kamjor hui he or hamaari baatcheet ke lahaze main giravat ai he
 According to the New York Times news, both Trump and Bush think differently
 trump jahaan vyapaar ke prati sangrakshanvaad kii vakaalat karte hai or nae bahari logon ko aane se rokte hai vahiin bush pravaasiyon (immigrants) ke paksh main baat karte hai or mukt vyapaar kii vakaalat karte hai
 At the same time, criticize the current policy of nationalism and partisanship
 bush ke mutabik aisa lagata he ki hamen jodne vaali takat kamjor pad gai he or todane vaali takat taqatvar ho gai he
 We have forgotten the diversity and mobility that the diaspora brought with us

 There is a small but small community in our country that believes in the existence of ghosts and spirits
 kuch log aaj bhi maanate hai ki maanav jivan se pare kuch aisi shaktiyaan hai jo astitv main hoti hai
 People who believe in such things also try to communicate many times with ghosts and spirits
 yahaan tak ki aap bhale hi bhoot pret main yakeen karen yaa naa karen lekin paranormal ghatnaon main vishwaas rakhane vaale aapako salaah dete hai ki aap unka bhuulakar bhi majaak nahin udaae
 There are many professional paranormal investigators in India who claim to have interviewed ghosts
 in jaanchakartaaon ne kai varshon tak is kshetra main adhyayan karne ke baad kai hairaan karne vaali kahaniyaan share kii hai
 One such horror story is of Lonavala
 indian paranormal team ke akshay sthalekaar daawa karte hai ki vah pichley 8 saalon se paranormal ghatnaon kii jaanch kar rahe hai
 Sthalekar's team regularly conducts 'ghost Walk' in Pune and Lonavala
 is walk kaa makasad rojaanaa aisi bhutahi jagahon ke raat main chakkar lagaakar kuch atmaaon yaa bhoot pret ke krityon ko camere main kaid karnaa hota he
 Lonavala, located in a remote area of mumbai, is a heaven for couples in monsoons and winters, but it also has a deep connection with the creepy stories of ghosts
 lonavala kii pahadiyon main ek aisi hi 'ghost walk' ke dauraan sthalekar ko kuch aisa najar aayaa jo kisi bhi tarah kii vaigyanik vyakhya se baahar tha
 When Sthalekar was on the round with his team, his car knocked twice fast and after that his car suddenly shook
 yah ek madhya raatri thi
 The wind was blowing at night
 sthalekar or unki team ke 4 log ek choti car main yatra kar rahe the or cigarette pine ke liye car se baahar nikle the
 The team was at the same place where a lot of people come to visit during the day
 sthalekar bataate hai, hawa purab se pashchim bah rahi thi, tabhi achaanak ek sharaab kii khaali bottle jameen se tej gati se hawa kii disha ke vipareet upar uth gai
 His team felt that some unnatural or paranormal activity was happening
 is samay tak sthalekar or unke dost car main andar aa gaye the
 Soon the sound of a knock was heard twice on the glass of his car when there was no one there
 tabhi car achaanak se itani teji se hili jaise car naa ho koi tin kaa biscuit
 We sat down and quickly turned on our devices indicating the presence of spirits
 mashine lagaataar blink kar rahi thi
 According to this team's claim, they also used an app that was developed by the Americans
 is ap ke jariye paranormal gatividhiyon kii bhi aawaaj record hoti he
 Sthalkar had told, in this recorder, the voice of a woman speaking in Marathi was coming, but this voice was very rough and bad
 sthalekar ne kaha ki vah usase kuch or sawaal poochna chaahate hai, kya vah mukti paanaa chaahati hai lekin phir vah gaayab ho gai
 Horror sounds continued for a while and after a few minutes everything went back to normal

 The Chief Minister of Karnataka will be the one who will get the blessings of the Congress high command, but Siddaramaiah is among the leaders in the race for the post, who belong to the Kurba caste and come from the OBC
 siddharmaiya jameen se jude netaa kahe jate hai, lekin unki ek badi kami yah he ki vah jedies se congress main aae hai
 After the election results, Siddaramaiah, a five-time MLA from South Karnataka's Varuna seat, also claimed that he was among the strongest contenders for the post of Chief Minister
 doosraa naam ji parameshwar kaa he, jo karnataka congress ke adhyaksh hai or dalit hai
 Parmeshwar speaks good English, he is upbeat with big leaders in Delhi, but his way of working is said to be arbitrary
 teesraa naam mallikarjun khadge kaa bhi he, jo philhal centre main shram mantri hai or vah bhi dalit hai
 The comments unki chhavi saaf-suthri rahi he, lekin rajya kii raajnneeti ke bare main unki jaankaree zyada nahin maani jaati he or na hi unki pakad rajya main acchhee he
 Kharge has also indicated that he is ready to become the Chief Minister if his name is considered after the election victory in the state
 vaise, kendriya mantri virappa moili kaa naam bhi mukhyamantri ke daavedaaron main shaamil kiya ja rahaa he, kyonki vah gandhi parivaar ke kareebi hai, lekin rajya ke netaa unhen zyada pasand nahin karte hai
 Siddaramaiah is said to be a land leader, but one of his major drawbacks is that he has come to Congress from JDS
 vaise chunaav parinaamon ke aane ke baad dakshin karnataka kii varuna seat se paanch baar vidhayak rah chuke siddharmaiya ne daawa bhi kiya ki vah mukhyamantri pad ke sabase majboot daavedaaron main shaamil hai
 The second name is of g Parameshwara, who is the president of Karnataka Congress and is a Dalit
 parameshwar acchhee angreji bolte hai, dilli main bade netaaon ke saath unki uth−baith he, lekin unke kaam karne kaa tarika manamaana bataaya jaataa he
 The third name is also of Mallikarjun Kharge, who is currently the Labor Minister at the Center and he is also a Dalit
 tippaniyan His image has been clean, but his information about the politics of the state is not considered much nor is he good in the state
 khadge ne bhi sanket diya he ki rajya main chunavi jeet ke baad yadi unke naam par vichaar hota he, to vah mukhyamantri banane ke liye taiyaar hai
 By the way, Union Minister Veerappa Moily's name is also being included among the contenders for the Chief Minister, as he is close to the Gandhi family, but the state leaders do not like him much

 media kaa anderworlddilip mandalradhakrishna prakaashan, dariyaganj,nai dilli-2keemtah 350 ru
 There is also an underworld of media, about which there is little or no discussion in the media itself
 aparaadh ke anderworld kii tarah media ke anderworld main bhi har tarah ke dhatakaram ho rahe hai
 The news is being openly traded, the newspapers are being 'managed', readers and viewers are being deceived and the news media's agenda is setting corporate capital and political power
 nateeja, yah anderworld munafv ke liye patrakarita ke sabhi aadarshon, mulyon, siddhanton or naitikta kii khuleam boli lagane main bhi nahin hichkicha rahaa he
 However, there is nothing new in this
 patrkaar or media vishleshak dilip mandal apni kitaab 'media kaa anderworldah ped news, korporate or loktantr' main sweekaar karte hai ki bhartiya samachar media main ye pravritiyaan kaaphi lambey arase se dekhi ja rahi hai
 Although, at first they were a little covered-up and scared-shy but in the last few years this open game has become far-fetched
 is bich, media ke is anderworld kaa na sirf dayera or dabadabaa badha he balki kaaphi had tak laaj-shame bhi khatm ho gai he
 In particular, the trend of paid news buying or selling has increased to such an extent that from Parliament to the road, it has started going through
 nishchay hi, iske kaaran samachar media kii saakh daraki he
 His image of the fourth pillar of democracy and the watchman of public interest has disintegrated and has been questioned publicly
 iske baavjood khud media ne apane tain ise andekha karne kii bahut koshish kii or sab kuch khulne ke baavjood abhi bhi ek pardadari dikhti he
 It is indeed very surprising that the news media, which considers their right to discuss and tear down all the big and small issues of the country and the world, does not seem very keen to chime in or talk about themselves
 lekin ab sthiti dhire-dhire badalane lagi he
 Owing to the increasing criticism, the work of the media itself is being investigated and discussed
 pichley ek-dedh dashakon main jis tarah se media kaa vistaar or uske prabhaav main vruddhi hui he, uske kaaran loktantric dhaanche main uski bhoomika or kriyakalapon kii chaanbin or vimarsh main ruchi kaaphi bad gai he
 The result of this is the book of Dilip Mandal
 iskaa kai kaarnon se swaagat kiya janaa chahie
 It not only examines the spread of paid news cancer in the news media but also tries to examine it in the context of the corporate structure of the media and its broader political economics
 is prakriya main yah media ke us anderworld par se paradaa uthaane main kaaphi had tak kaamyaab hoti he, jo haal ke varshon main korporate media kii mukhyadhara par chaataa ja rahaa he
 Many of Mandal's installations are startling but it is difficult to disagree with them
 jaise aaj ''media kii antarvastu lagbhag puri tarah se media ke arthshaastra se nirdhaarit ho rahi he
 Ba on editorial content
 jaar kaa niyantran lagbhag samgr rup se sthapit ho chukaa he
 Advertisers have begun to determine to a large extent what will be printed as well as what will be printed
 '' unka yah bhi kahana he ki, ''is vajah se content kii vividhta kaa bhi lagbhag ant ho gaya he
 Media views have been standardized on almost all important issues
 ''ve yaheen nahin rukate
 He also believes that the institution called the editor in the media has almost completely decayed
 media kaarobaar main sampadakeey swatantraaa ab akhbaar yaa channel ke vyavsaayik hiton ke daayre se baahar sambhav nahin he
 "they are very unsympathetic, saying that the readers or viewers who expect to pay about 10 to 20 percent of the cost of a newspaper or magazine or channel, that they will give it the right information or talk about their interest, are in great misunderstanding
" 
 mandal ke mutabik, ped news media ko lagi gambhir beemaari kaa lakshan maatr he
 They have many such traits - Private Treaty, medianet, p
 aar
 Referring to the open infiltration of the media and the radioisation of the media, etc
, the real disease of the media is seen in its business structure and goals
 yahi nahin, mandal media swaamitv ke maujuuda korporavt dhaanche ko lekar apni niraashaa chhipate nahin hai
 He sees no hope from this corporate media
 ve maanate hai ki yah media par ba
 Czar and advertising is a period of victory
 nishchay hi, ped news kii parighatna loktantric raajnneeti ke liye khatre kii ghanti he
 The underworld of the media is busy digging the roots of democracy
 lekin usase bhi badi chintaa kii baat mukhyadhara ke samachar media kaa korporavt techover he jo munaafe or korporate hiton ko aage badhaane ke liye khabaron kii kharid-farokht se lekar loktantric prakriya main tod-marod karne se bhi nahin hichkicha rahaa he
 Although Mandal does not suggest any solution to this, the truth is that treatment starts with the correct investigation of the disease

 The Aam Aadmi Party has been torn apart in Punjab after the Chief Minister of Delhi and Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal apologized to Bikram Singh Majithia, former Revenue Minister of Punjab
 party kaa ek dhada arvind kejariwal ke saath khadaa he to duusare dhade ne kejariwal se duuri banaate hue unke maafeename par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 This is the reason that out of 20 mlas, only 10 mlas reached the meeting held by the party high command in Delhi on Sunday
 yani aadhe vidhayak baagi hai or unhone haikaman ko sidhe-sidhe yah kah diya he ki agar wo baat karnaa chaahate hai to uske liye chandigarh aaen

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will reach Israel on Tuesday
 isroyal kaa apana hi ek itihaas rahaa he, lekin sabase isroyal ko lekar jo sabase bada mudda he vah he isroyal or philistin ke bich rishton kaa
 The dispute between the two countries over the Gaza Strip has been going on for a long time, which is why India has also made distance from Palestine for some time
 padhiye aakhir kya he gaja pattee kaa puraa vivaad?gaja pattee ek chote sa philistini kshetra he, yah misr or israyal ke madhya bumadhyasagariya tat par sthit he
 Palestine is an Arabic and majority Muslim majority area
 is par 'hamaas' dwaara shashan kiya jaataa he jo isroyal virdohi aatankwaadi samooh he
 They are like this because Palestine and many other Muslim countries refuse to consider Israel as a Jewish state
 1947 ke baad jab UN ne philistin ko ek yahudee or ek arab rajya main baant diya tha jiske baad se philistin or isroyal ke bich sanrghash jari he jisamen ek ahm mudda juis rajya ke rup main sweekaar karnaa he to doosraa gaja pattee he jo israel kii sthapana ke samay se hi isroyal or duusare arab deshon ke bich sangharsh kaa kaaran sabit hua he
 Israel does not even give a price to China ahead of India, the strongest friend is in defense
 The second war in 1967 lasted for 6 days, in which Israel again occupied the Gaza Strip
 isroyal kaa yah kabja 25 saalon tak chalaa lekin disambar 1987 main gaja ke philistiniyon ke bich dangon or hinsak jhadap ke kaaran or israeli sainikon par kabja karne se ek vidroh kaa rup de diya

 In September 2005, Israel completed its exodus from the area, and control over the Gaza Strip was transferred to the PA, although Israel continued its fielding and airlift
 border kii suraksha or ganga kii safai, padhein- isroyal se kya-kya laaenge modi?june 2007 main hamaas ne ek baar phir gaja pattee par kabja kar liya or fatah (philistin raajnneetik samuh) kii aguwai vaali apatkaaleen cabinet ne pashchim bank kaa kabza kar liya tha
 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced that Gaza would remain under Hamas control
 2007 ke ant main isroyal ne gaja pattee ko dushman kshetra ghoshit kar diya or iske saath hi gaja par kai pratibandhon ko manjuuri di jisamen bijli katautee, baari pratibandhit aayaat or seemaa ko band karnaa shaamil tha
 Following the attacks in January 2008, these restrictions on Gaza were further extended and further sealed its border with the Gaza Strip to temporarily halt fuel imports, after which the Hamas army called the Gaza Strip - Dismounted along Egypt's border so that thousands of Gazans arrived in Egypt to provide food, fuel and goods due to the blockade
 iske baad european union ke peeche hatane or sahmati ke baad gaja pattee ko chaaron taraf se sil kar diya

 It is not new for film artists to enter politics, but this trend has not been successful in North India as compared to South India
 tamilnadu or andhra pradesh ke logon main filmi kalakaaron ke prati jabardast aakarshan dekha gaya he or in pradeshon ke logon ne anti ramarao or emji ramchandran jaise filmi duniya ke sheersh kalakaaron ko satta kii kunjee saunpi bhi, lekin amitabh bachchan, rajesh khanna, dharmendra or govinda raajnneeti main aae, lekin bich main hi ise chhod gaye

 ’’ Being a part of rave parties among the youth of the capital Delhi has now become a new status symbol
 aisi partiyon main janaa or der raat bina kisi bandish ke nashe kii duniya main gum ho janaa, kai naujavaanon ko ek ‘kool idia’ lagata he
 This is the reason that despite all the police and Narcotics Control Bureau's watchfulness, such parties have become a common thing in Delhi and surrounding areas
 kai logon ke liye ye ek chaunkaanewaali khabar ho sakati he, lekin is dhandhe par najar rakhanevaale log ye jaanate hai ki kaise dilli or aas-paas ke ilaake lagaataar rev partiyon kii giraft main aa rahe hai
 Recently, Delhi Police arrested a foreigner who, during interrogation, confessed to organizing more than 20 rave parties in just two months
 usne bataaya ki ye partiyaan usne shahar ke hi jane-maane raison kii madad se mehrauli, gudgaanv or sohana road ke kai farm houseon, greater kailash, new frends colony, saket or nehru place ke kuch hotalon or flats main yojit kii
 Since these parties have the highest use of expensive intoxicating substances such as cocaine and heroin, in addition to synthetics drugs, rich people are also the most caught by these parties
 aisi partiyon ke aayojak apane grups ke bich phone yaa esemes ke jariye daavat dete hai or phir nashe ke shaukeen har tarah ke nashon ke liye aise mahfuj thikaanon tak pahunch jate hai
 Since all this happens in a highly intelligence manner, the police often do not know about them
 or kai baar pataa chalane par bhi wo in partiyon main khalal daalane kaa jokhim nahin uthaati
 However, now in cases, middle class youth along with rais have started going to rave parties, while many rave parties have proved to be the cause of rape for girls
 rev partiyon main 'hai and' drugs kaa sabase zyada istemaal hota he
 The Narcotics Control Bureau has also made it clear that by looking at the consignment of drugs in the last one year, it has become clear how the trend of high-end drugs i
e
 expensive drugs has increased among the people
 sirf ek saal main dilli main enasibi ne 84 kilo 47 gram heroin, jabaki 26 kilo 34 gram cocaine baraamad kii he or antarrashtriya bazaar main nashe kii is khep kii keemat karodon rupee main ho sakati he
 While there are different types of drug use among every section in India, there are countless ways of 'drug abuse'
 lekin naujavaanon ke bich rev partiyaan isliye bhi ek bada khatra he, kyonki ab 'pear pressure' se shuru hokar ye partiyaan ab raison ke bich ek 'maas histeria' kii shakl akhriyaar karata ja rahaa he

 Another user has written that there is a great difference between being Sati and being Jauhar
 ek yujar ne likhaa he swara ko teen talaak or halaala par likhnaa chahie, na ki us pratha par jo saat sau saal pehle chalati thi
 One user said that if someone makes a film on slavery then it is not that slavery is being glorified
 ek yujar ne likhaa he ki aapane bhi ranjhna main stocking ko gloriphai kiya he
 i loved the performances by all the actors in # Padmaavat- The film is seductive in its grandeur, scale, beauty, power of its actors' performances, music, design, vision

 *** saansadon dwaara nijee airlines se khaas suvidhaayen maange jane ke maamle ne tool pakad liya he
 The government is now looking defensively on this issue
 saansad khaas hai yaa aam, yah bahes in dinon aviation field main jagah-jagah chhidi hui he
 While mps are trying to show themselves higher and special than ordinary air travelers, people are raising fingers on it
 ab tak sarkari airlines yani air india saansadon ko kuch khaas suvidhaayen detii he, masalan--airport lounj ke istemaal kii suvidha
 - Free food and drinks
 -check-in main variyata-saamaan ke liye kuli kii suvidha
 Facilities like advance information of delay in flight
 iske alaava yah bhi mana jaataa he ki apane rutabe kaa istemaal kar saansad kai baar or kai manamaani suvidhaayen le lete hai
 People also have very different opinions about this
 kuch jaankaar ise sahi tehraakar iskaa samarthan bhi karte hai, lekin yah bhi kehete hai ki yah sarkaar yaa dijisie ke kehane se nahin hota he
 Former DGCA Kanu Gohain said, 'if something gets courtesy, what's wrong? If it is not found, such a question should arise
 lekin mere khyal se sarkaar yaa dijisie ke kehane se yah sab nahin hota
 'on the other hand a fairly large section is against giving special facilities to mps and strongly opposes it
 uddyan visheshgy harshavardhan kehete hai, 'ye raaje-rajavaadon vaali or khud ko dusron se alag or khaas dikhaane kii koshish he
 this is wrong
 'vahiin sarkaar is maamle par khud ko ghirta dekh baikfoot par aa gai he
 The government is now denying that it has ever asked private airlines to provide special facilities to mps
 naagarik uddyan mantri ajit singh ne kaha, 'hamane aisa koi aadesh nahin diya he
 Anyway, airlines have already provided some facilities to many people, such as judges, VC, etc
, it is not just for mps
 
 
 lekin hamane koi aadesh nahin diya he
 'in the election season, when everyone wants to stand with the common man, is this attempt to stand apart from the common man, is it not like axing his feet? The debate in this matter is still going on, but the big question is why are the mps avoiding traveling like a common traveler? bollywood ke king shahrukh khan (shah Rukh Khan) in dinon soshal media par khub active najar aa rahe hai

 nai dilli railway stesan ke washing yard main khadi sialdah rajdhani ke chaar dibbe jalakar khaak ho gaye
 The fire spread so fast that fire spread in the coaches of the capital Bhubaneswar behind it
 iske bhi do dibbe jal gaye
 Thankfully, as soon as the coaches were on fire, the railway staff present there separated the burning coaches from the train
 varanaa puri train jalakar khaak ho jaati he
 Fire around 11 in the morning
 30 baje lagi jab ye donon rajdhani washing yard par khadi thi
 Suddenly, the cans of Sealdah Rajdhani started burning before their cleaning work started
 kareeb 12 baje fire brigade kii chah gaadiyaan pahunchi or do ghante main aag par kaabo paaya gaya
 Fire brigade officials are considering three reasons for the blaze
 pehla jahaan bogi khadi thi usee ke neeche dijal aapurti karne kaa ek pipe gaya he
 The comments fire brigade ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki jitani teji se aag lagi he usase is baat kii ashanka zyada he ki dijal pipe line se licage hua he or isi ke chalate aag lagi ho kyonki rajdhani kii sabhi bogiyaan asi thim or chaaro taraf se lock thi
 The second reason is the pantry bogey in the Sealdah capital
 teesraa kaaran kisi ne jaanboojhkar aag lagaai ho sakati he
 This is the third case of fire in bogies parked in different railway yards across the country
 is maamle kii jaanch ke liye ucchstareey jaanch cameti banaai gai he
 But in the railways, a coach of the capital is ready for about 2 to 2
5 crores, in such a situation, the railway definitely got 12 crores

 It was 30 o'clock when the two Rajdhani were standing at the washing yard
 inaki saaf-safai kaa kaam shuru hone se pehle hi achaanak sialdah rajdhani ke dibbe jalane lage
 About 12 o'clock six fire brigade vehicles arrived and the fire was controlled in two hours
 fire brigade ke adhikari aag lagane ke teen kaarnon par vichaar kar rahe hai
 First, there is a pipe to supply diesel under the bogie where it was standing
 tippaniyan Fire brigade officials say that it is more likely that the diesel pipeline may have leaked due to the rapid fire which has caused the fire because all the bogies in the capital were AC and locked on all sides
 doosraa kaaran sialdah rajdhani main pentry kii bogi he
 The third reason may be someone deliberately set fire
 deshbhar main alag-alag railway yard main khadi bogiyon main aag lagane kaa ye teesraa maamla he
 a high-level inquiry committee has been set up to investigate the matter
 lekin railway main rajdhani kii ek coach kareeb 2 se dhai karod main banakar taiyaar hoti he aise main 12 karod kii chapat railway ko jarur lag gai

 Gandhi and Pandey, familiar with the names of @mrsgandhi and @isupportnamo on Twitter, had 30,000 and 18,000 followers respectively till the last update
 ye donon internet par hindutv, bijepi or modi samarthak us birdari ke sabase jane-pahachaane chehre hai jo soshal media or internet par chalane vaali har bahes main apni dhak jamaa rahi he
 This fraternity may be broadly based even though it received instructions from the bjp's information-technology arm, ie, party headquarters at Delhi 11, Ashoka Road, a 100-man team of social media managers and technicians and the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's unit in Ahmedabad
 Ho, but it is full of multidimensional and independent people
 ye log hamaare irdagird chaaron taraf dikhte hai
 They may be sitting in an adjacent cubicle in your office or on the side table in the class room
 ve hameshaa apane smartphone par internet khangalate milenge
 They are connected to each other by a network that brings together people from different backgrounds
 unhen lagata he ki unki aawaaj suni ja rahi he or soshal media par sakriy, unheen kii jaisi soch vaale political activist unki baat ko or dur tak le ja rahe hai
 Evidence of this community's effective penetration on the Internet can be seen in the India Today Group's Election Survey
 is surveykshan main aam chunaav kii tarj par loksabhaa kshetron main internet or mobile par logon ko vot karne ko kaha gaya tha
 a provision was made to open the ballot with one password on the mobile phone at a time so that a mobile number can be voted once and there is no scope for rigging
 23 sitambar se 30 aktubar tak apratyaashit rup se kul 5,56,460 vot daalane vaale yugers main se 3,38,401 ne bijepi ko chunaa
 Even in all-round Uttar Pradesh, 87
 1 pratishat vot bijepi ke paksh main pade
 The results of this survey may not be telling the ground reality, but one thing proves conditionally that the internet has turned saffron
 bharat main internet kii pahunch, istatindia dotcom ke mutabik, sirf 10 pratishat logon tak hi he or yujar kareeb 11
 There are only 618 crores
 lekin duusari ore aktubar main google ke ek survey ke mutabik, har 10 shahari matadaataaon main se 4 yani 37 pratishat shahari matadaata ab internet par hai
 This Internet fraternity leaned towards Hindutva, often resorting to abuse
 yah amuman dhur alpsankhyak virdohi or hameshaa sarkaar virdohi hoti he
 She likes to call herself an internet Hindu now
 gandhi kahati hai, ''jab mujhe koi sanghee yaa dakshinpanthi yaa internet hindu kahata he to meraa man khil uthta he
 i think i should say 'wow! What is the matter'
 ” unki bhashaa yuva or bolchaal vaali he
 (in every sentence in the style of American teenagers, 'O Wave Like', Gandhi also attests to this)
 ) lekin unka agenda post modern or parampara kaa mishran he
 This fraternal dynastic politics is particularly opposed to the nehru-gandhi dynasty but it does not have any opinion on the politics of father-son in BJP and its allies like Shiv Sena
 vah alpsankhyak tushtikaran ko 'chhadam dharmanirpekshata’ aise tevar ke saath kahati he jiskaa arth badi aasaani se hindu aadhipaty kii aakanksha yaa muslim virodh lagaaya ja saktaa he
 These people are opposed to Dalit and OBC reservation, especially because it is not implemented properly
 unhen desh kii aantarik suraksha kii chintaa he
 But above all, they are against corruption
 modi kaa chumbakeey aakarshanainake behad aakraamak kism ke twit se bhale aisa na lage lekin is birdari main tamaam aise hai jo ekaadh saal ke bheetar hi soshal media par sakriy hue hai
 And at that time it was probably not his motive to support BJP or its policies
 pandeya ko hi lijie
 He opened his Twitter account the day he heard that Sachin Tendulkar has come on Twitter
 ve kehete hai, ''mere parivaar main aresas se jude log rahe hai lekin main to sachin ko dekhakar hi twitor kii ore khinchaa aayaa
 After entering this world, a series of successes started
 ”pantis varshiya shilpi tiwari kii padhai architect kii he or ab ve apane pati ke saath ek kansaltency form chalaati hai
 Shilpi says that earlier she has been involved in government projects
 unhen sabase pehle anna hajaare or unke jan lokapal andolan ne aakarshith kiya
 She says, "I was raising voice against corruption in Ramlila Maidan with thousands of people
" ”baad main jab congress or sarkaar virdohi bhavanaaen tikhi hone lageen tab unka jhukaav bijepi or khaskar modi kii ore hua
 Now Tiwari and all the people like him believe that it is because of his efforts that Modi has been able to win the race for the post of Prime Minister in BJP
 ve muskaraa kar kahati hai, ''hamane unki ummidavaari kaa samarthan hi nahin kiya, balki use hasil karvaa diya
 According to Anja Kovacs, director of the Internet Democracy Project in Delhi, middle-class young BJP supporters are purely a product of internet proliferation
 ve kahati hai, ''darasal, is internet andolan kii aguai takanic ke un exparts ne kii he jo videsh chale gaye hai lekin har vakt bharat se judye ke maukey kii talash main rahete hai
 Middle-class and economically aspiring youths, who are also mostly connected to the Internet, will naturally be attracted to the BJP instead of the Communists
 ”iaries nolej foundation or internet and mobile association of india ke ek surveykshan ke mutabik, 2014 ke aam chunaavon main soshal media 160 loksabhaa siton ko prabhavit karne ja rahaa he
 In October, Google's survey says that about 42 percent of all Internet voters connected to the Internet are still not able to decide whom to vote for
 is tarah abhi ek bada vot bank kisi bhi ore jhuk saktaa he
 However, it should not surprise anyone that most of the urban voters have searched any leader on Google, then they are Narendra Modi
 vaise to ye internet yoddha kai bhagava kheme se hai (dekhen box), lekin inkaa bada hissaa modi ke prati badi shiddat se aakarshith he
 He feels that Modi will do no wrong
 pandeya, tiwari or kishoravastha se hi aresas- bijepi se jude patakadhari sikh 27 varshiya tejinderpal singh bagga kaa kahana he ki ve modi ke andh bhakt nahin hai, balki unki nitiyon, unke vikaas mantra or unki saaf-suthri chhavi ke kaaran unka samarthan karte hai
 However, when asked if Modi did anything in his entire political career that he could not agree with, no one had any grievance with him
 hamane poocha, ''to kya ve hameshaa sahi rahe hai?” sabhi ne kamobesh ek hi tareeke se dhire se jawaab diya, ''nahin” lekin kisi ke paas is sawaal kaa khandan karne vaala koi uttar nahin tha
 It seems that only half-baked political understanding and sentimental things are prevalent in the online Hindu space
 itihaaskaar ramchandra guha ne apni kitaab patriots and partigens main ek adhyay 'hindutv het mail’ ko samarpit kiya he, jo unhen kai varshon main lekhak or stanbhakaar ke rup main praapt hue hai
 In many emails and letters to the editor, he was described as a pony of the Gandhi family
 guha kaa maananaa he ki unka sabaka ''aise logon se padaa jo munh andhere uthte hai, ek gilaas gaay kaa doodh pite hai, surya ko namaskara karte hai or phir internet kholkar aaj ke secularon ko tohamat bhejne ke liye muhaavarey kii talash karne main jute jate hai
 Guha's word has its dangers of believing literally
 aaj ke hindu online yoddha ke unke varnan main aanshik sachaai hi he
 Now a large number of this community gets up in the morning, goes jogging, tastes a cup of black coffee and starts their SUV like thousands of executives
 inamen doctor, ejeeniyar, ity profeshnal, naukarshah, kol centre main kaam karne vaale, patrkaar or vyapaar-udyog dhandhe vaale hai
 They are adept at their work but often their shallow political knowledge makes them ridiculous and they become unnecessarily aggressive
 unki duniya main sab kuch kaala-safed hi hota he, us par or kisi tarah kaa rang chadhataa hi nahin
 Priti Gandhi, referring to AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi's hate speech last December, says, "we are not anti-muslim but if you force us, then there is bound to be a reaction
 varanaa, mere kuch achche dost musalmaan hai
 "the irony is that according to the Urban Dictionary, a guide to online idioms," some of my best friends "mean" what some prejudiced people say when they get caught up in their prejudice
 " ”eka hi unki takatis online birdari ke log ab ek-duusare ko hakeekat main bhi jaanane lage hai
 Everyone has each other's email, phone number, address, and everyone tries to gather at some intervals for food, etc
 ve ek-duusare ke shahar main jane par gharon main jate hai or bacchon kii padhai se lekar har cheez par baat karte hai
 In reality, meeting each other is also due to the fact that during the attack of 'pseudo secularists' on the Internet, they meet each other
 ek myne main yah dhili-dhaali online birdari vakt-jarurat par ek-duusare ke kaam bhi aati he
 a month ago, 35-year-old Rudra Shekhar (@rudrahindu on Twitter) himself revealed that he is in the hospital due to kidney disease
 online birdari ne twitor par sandesh bhejkar ilaaj ke liye 2 lakh rupye juta liye
 Rudra Shekhar died on 7 October
 unki antim ichha thi ki unka antim sanskaar unke parthiv sharir ko bijepi ke jhande main lapet kar kiya jaae
 Bagga says, "we had never met him, but he was our friend
" ” rudra shekhar kii na sirf antim ichha puri kii gai, balki unke pita ko modi ne khud phone karke apni shradhanjali arpit kii
 But the real complaint against the members of this fraternity is that they find and chase the Congress leaders, supporters and journalists whom they call a gang of pro-government 'paid media'
 ve atyant aakraamak kism kii kuta bhashaa main baat karte hai (dekhen box) or vaad-vivaad main kamjor padane par akasar gaali-galouj par utar aate hai
 Congress supporters also respond to abuses
 lekin unamem vah talkhi nahin hoti he
 In this way, the level of political debate on social media drops significantly
 ek congress samarthak amaresh mishra to shilpi tiwari ko march main gambhir nateezon kii dhamkee de baithe
 However, the loud voices of the Congress are usually lost in the number of BJP supporters and their voice
 sienen-ibn kii dipti editor sagarika ghosh ke tivi sho or lekhon par lagaataar tikhi tippanee kii jaati he
 She says that many tweets are light-hearted but some are very dangerous
 unke shabdon main, ''ek baar kisi ne likhaa ki vah meri bacchee ke skool kaa samay jaanata he
 i got quite scared
 twitor ko aise hi log badnaam kar rahe hai, varanaa vah adbhut kism kaa loktantric manch he
 “the matter reached such a point that this May, Bijpi's IT unit chief Arvind Gupta issued social media guidelines for party officials, members and supporters
 apni tarah ke is iklaute dishanirdesh main kaha gaya ki ''tarah-tarah ke masalon par swasth bahes kaa hameshaa swaagat he kyonki isse muddon kii jatilta or uske pahaluon kii samaj viksit hoti he
 But the debate should not turn into indecent behavior
 ”bijepi yaa uske samarthakon vaale online brigade kaa ek hissaa bhale hi ashleel bhashaa kaa istemaal na karata ho, phir bhi party un tamaam logon kaa saath nahin chhod sakati jo uske paksh main internet par sakriy hai
 Many unknown names like @hinduidf and @barbarindian constantly use vulgar language on social media but BJP supporters never call them anything
 iske peeche tark yah diya jaataa he ki 've radical yani ugrapanthi ho sakate hai par ve hamaare apane radical hai
 "the Internet is a mirror of society like cinema or music," says Gupta
 gaali-galouj amuman acchhee bhashaa na jaanane se bhi nikalati he
 Just like in college, if you are not able to put your point in a debate, then you come down on the kind of vulgar aggression
 lekin aise log kul milakar paanch pratishat hi hai
 Most of our supporters are educated and modern
 ”haalanki is online birdari kii bhashaa, uske arth or uski manyataon par bahes kii gunjaaish bani rah sakati he lekin zyaadaatar log nek iraadon se hi aae hai
 And that is the intention of nationalism
 unamem rashtrawaad kaa jajba he or ve apane vichaaron ke aadhaar par anyaay ke khilaaf laduya chaahate hai tathaa prabhavi badlaav laana chaahate hai
 His assessment of his own heroes with a little typical conscientiousness, low rationality and little negativity is turning him into a serious political fraternity
 internet par bijepi ke varchasv par congress ke pravaktaa sanjay jha kehete hai, ''dushprachaar aise hi kaam karata he
 The same thing has to be said repeatedly and loudly
 ve logon par shabdon or vichaaron kii bauchhaar kar dete hai
 Until last year, the presence of Congress on social media was almost nil, so they climbed so much
 ab congress ne bhi is par kaam shuru kiya he
 Social media is a platform in which the edge of the first person can be eliminated in a short time
 ”lekin congress kii yah dharna bhi thik nahin lagati ki bijepi ke internet samarthakon kaa aadhaar gadha hua or farji he, kyonki aankade bhi kuch kehete hai
 Social media has made it clear what it wants in the 2014 general elections
 duusari partiyaan yah sochakar dilasa paa sakati hai ki online birdari hi yah tay nahin karegi ki desh kii satta kise mili
 Nor can you tweet your votes right now
 kam-se-kam abhi to yah sambhav nahin
 India's senior batsman Gautam Gambhir expressed his anguish over the gang-rape of the girl in Delhi and her subsequent death, urging people to continue their struggle against this heinous crime

 tippaniyan Gambhir said, it is not surprising to see that the United States and Britain are reviewing the consultation on Delhi's visit

 Gambhir also appealed to maintain confidence in Team India despite the recent poor performance
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare upar, bhartiya team par bharosa rakho

 com / gathsnklss china ke saath 1962 main hue yuddh ke 50 varsh baad is ladaai main shahid hue javaanon ko shradhanjali di gai
 Defense Minister AK Antony, along with the chiefs of the three wings of the army, laid a wreath on Saturday to mark the completion of 50 years of war on the Amar Jawan Jyoti
 is dauraan yuddh main shaamil rahe bhartiya vayusena ke field marshall arjan singh bhi amar jawan jyoti par maujuud the
 The comments 20 oktober, 1962 ko shuru hui yah ladaai kareeb ek maheene tak chali thi or isamen bharat ke chaar hajaar se zyada jawan or sainya adhikari shahid hue the
 The Indian army had to face defeat in the Ladakh region of the eastern region and the northeastern states, while the enemy suffered heavy losses in the Rijang La area
 do din pehle china dwaara 1962 ko dohraane kii sambhaavnaaon ko nakaarte hue rakshaamantri eke antni ne kaha tha ki bharat ab apni raksha karne main puri tarah sakasham he
 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a naval conference, Antony had said, "the infrastructure in the Northeast is not to our satisfaction, but it has improved a lot compared to the past

 hansaa research ne bharat ke logon kaa siyaasi nabj tatolane ke liye desh kaa sabase bada opinian pole kiya he
 
 
 Hansa Research has prepared this poll after talking to about two lakh people
 sabase bade opinian pole 2014 main kal tak kul 319 seat par raay jari kii gai thi
 Today, in the second part of the opinion poll, 154 Lok Sabha seats were projected, according to which BJP will emerge as the largest party
 Kangana Ranaut's 'manikarnika' Movie Review: subhadrakumari chouhan kii kavita 'khub ladi mardaani wo to jhaansi vaali rani thi' ko bachapan se sunate aae hai or jhaansi kii rani kii ek image isi kavita ne hamaare jehan main banaai he
 But Kangana Ranaut has also brought an image of the queen of Jhansi in 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi'
 kangana ranut ne jhaansi kii rani lakshmibai ke kirdaar ko bakhubi parade par utaara he lekin 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' is lejandary kairactor ke saath insaaf karti najar nahin aati he or kamjor diarection film kii sabase badi chook he
 The battle over the direction of the film is well known and finally Kangana Ranaut had to take command in her own hands
 kamjor diarection or bachakaani baaten puri film par haaavee rahati hai
 There should be some more work on the manner and style of English speaking in films, otherwise it seems very ridiculous because this style is now outdated
 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' kii kahani manikarnika ke janm se shuru hoti he or bachapan main hi elaan kar diya jaataa he ki uski umr lambii ho na ho lekin uskaa naam bada hoga
 Kangana Ranaut's entry is with tiger hunting and Kangana looks very beautiful as well
 jhaansi ke raja ke liye manikarnika ko chunaa jaataa he or shaadi par uskaa naam lakshmibai ho jaataa he
 But due to the demise of the child, the British try to grab Jhansi under the 'policy of usurpation' and then the queen of Jhansi declares that she will not give her Jhansi to anyone
 film kii kahani conect nahin kar paati he or first half main dher saare gane or slo story tang karti he
 The childhood of Jhansi Ki Rani (jhansi Ki Rani) is not shown
 duusare half main jang shuru hone par film josh bharti he
 But the whole film seems like a stage play because of its over-dramatization
 seen ripitishan bhi tang karata he
 Kangana Ranaut in Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi) plays the role of Rani Laxmibai, but sometimes the expressions are over and the fun gets spoiled there
 phir deshbhakti kaa rang kuch zyada maatra main dikhaane ke chakkar main bhi expreshans or acting donon hi patari se utar jate hai
 The ending of Jhansi ki Rani is very disturbing because the Jhansi ki Rani that we have read about, dies while fighting the British and succumbs to the ashram of Gangadas
 lekin 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi' main jo ant dikhaaya gaya he, vah thodaa tang karata he
 The film also stars Ankita Lokhande and Atul Kulkarni and has also acted properly
 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi (manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi)' ke dialog prasoon joshi ne likhe he, or ve bilkul dil ko chune kaa kaam nahin karte hai
 Prasoon Joshi has completely missed out on the song of the film
 'manikarnikah da queen of jhaansi' ke gane film ke flo ko todate hai or first half main to ve uktane kaa kaam karte hai
 The budget of 'manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' is said to be around Rs 100 crore, but due to weak directions and childish acting, the biopic of 'jhansi Ki Rani' disappoints and breaks her heart
 vishwa aarthik manch (WEF) main shirkat karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi daavos ravaanaa ho chuke hai
 After 21 years, an Indian Prime Minister has reached this stage
 piem modi se pehle 1997 main echdi devgauda yahaan pahunche the
 On that visit to Deve Gowda, the country's renowned industrialist Rahul Bajaj has raised questions
 unhone kaha ki yah behad durbhagyapurna he ki devgauda is mahatvapurn daure par parivaar ke saath picnic manaane aae the
 Excited from PM Modi's visit, Rahul Bajaj said that we are very excited with the arrival of PM Modi
 ab bharat duniya kii teji se badhati arthvyavastha he
 There are many challenges before us, but now our PM is very good
 bharat is samay yuva desh he
 Most people are under 35 years old
 agar ham unhen shiksha or skill muhaiyaa karaayenge to ye desh kii takat main or ijapha karenge
 gst-demonetisation positive move: Rahul Bajaj said on GST that this is a very positive step
 ham log piem modi ke yahaan aane ko lekar behad utsahit hai
 Tomorrow will be a very big day when PM will give a speech here
 unhone kaha ki puri duniya jaanati he ki notebandi lambey samay main behad kargar he
 Expressing confidence in Modi, Bajaj said that we are sure that under the leadership of PM, the country's economic pace will touch new heights
 vitt mantri yaa doosraa adhikari hi jaataa tha daavosbeete do dashakon main bharat kii ore se vitt mantri yaa phir koi doosraa adhikari hi vahaan jaaya karata tha
 HD Deve Gowda became the 11th Prime Minister of the country in June 1996
 pradhanmantri banane ke kuch hi maheenon baad wo vishwa aarthik manch main hissaa lene ke liye gaye
 The situation at the time of Deve Gowda was different than that of Deve Gowda, this Davos visit of Modi is very special in terms of moving forward for the country
 devgauda ne jis samay yatra kii thi us samay desh ke halaat achche nahin the, lekin ab maahaul badla he or modi kuch nae iraade ke saath daavos ja rahe hai
 On his own visit to Davos, Modi himself said that the world knows well that Davos has become a big panchayat in the economic world and the giants of economic affairs gather here and decide the condition and direction of future economic conditions

 Vidarbha is a rich region in terms of mineral and natural resources
 lekin vikaas ke maamle main vidarbha ko peeche mana jaataa he
 According to the leaders coming from Vidarbha, Western Maharashtra is always given due importance to Vidarbha
 vidarbha ko kabhi uskaa haq nahin diya gaya
 On the issue of making Vidarbha a separate state, the ministers of Chief Minister Prithviraj's cabinet are also echoing the bjp's tone
 lekin is mudde par sahyogi shivesna bijepi ke sakht khilaaf he
 The Shiv Sena is not at all approved by Vidarbha apart from Maharashtra
 vidarbha ke alaava pashchim bengal se gorkhaland, assam se bodoland or uttar pradesh se harith pradesh ke nirmaan kii maang ne bhi jor pakad lee he
 The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), led by Union Minister Ajit Singh, has already made its demand for the creation of a separate green region for the western parts of Uttar Pradesh
 vah alag bundelkhand rajya ke nirmaan ke paksh main bhi hai
 The region is divided between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
 gorkhaland or bodoland ke samarthakon ne dhamkee di ki ve pruthak rajya ke gathan ke liye apana andolan tej karenge
 They say that with the formation of Telangana, the Center cannot deprive them of their old and just demands
 gorkhaland kii maang ko lekar darjeeling kii pahadiyon main gorkha janamukti morcha ke 72 ghante ke band ke aahvaan ke duusare din mangalvaar ko kalimpong ke dambarchowk main jijeem ke ek samarthak ne aatmadah kaa prayaas kiya
 Police said Mangal Singh Rajput (45), a resident of Kalimpong, poured petrol on himself and proceeded towards the crowded Dumberchowk and set himself on fire
 ghatana se bhaunchak log use bachaane daude or aag bujhane kaa prayaas kiya
 Rajput was rushed to the hospital where doctors said his condition remained critical as he had burnt 90 per cent

 Historical background has to be studied
 ’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious mission Make in India is discussed all over the world
 is yojana ko or bhi zyada shashakt banane ke liye companiyon ne ab 'mek in india' ke liye alag se officer niyukt karne shuru kar die he
 Saraf will give a new direction to Indian business: Airbus Group, a company that has taken a step forward for the Make in India mission, has appointed Ashish Saraf as Vice President of Industry Development, Strategic Partnership and Offset Section
 ashish sarraf isse pehle tata sicorski ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 Taking responsibility for these new posts, Ashish will now work to give a new direction to the Indian businesses of the group
 desh ke swadeshikaran kaa lakshya hasil karne main madadashish ko mek in india ke avasaron ko bhunaane ke liye nai ranneeti taiyaar karne kii jimmedaari di gai he jo kicompany ke liye behatar sabit ho
 Sarraf said that Airbus Group's goal is to become a standard-setting company towards fulfilling the 'make in India' thinking
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki main na sirf company kaa lakshya, balki apane desh ke swadeshikaran kaa lakshya bhi hasil karne main madad karuunga
 These areas are included
 The President of Airbus Group India said that Ashish is a talented Indian officer
 saath hi airospes or dephence sector main anbhavi bhi hai
 Let us tell you that the purpose of Make in India, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is to make the country a hub of manufacturing

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 3 oktober ko 'man kii baat' kaarykram main desh ke har ghar main khaadi ke ek vastra apnaane kii bhaavnaatmak apil kii
 The public seems to have taken this appeal of the Prime Minister seriously
 kam se kam dilli main yahi jaan padataa he, kyonki akele dilli ke khaadi bhawan ne 4 oktober ke din 64
 Sales tax of Rs 70 lakh broke all records
 is bikri se utsahit sookshm laghu, madhyam udyog mantralay ek din kii bikri ko ek karod rupee tak le jane kii disha main kadam badha rahaa he
 Talking about the figures, after the pm's appeal, sales have gone up by 292 percent in one day
 aam aadmi hi nahin, saansad bhi ab seepidbludi vibhaag par khaadi ke parade aadi apane sarkari awaas main lagane kii maang karne lage hai
 On this occasion, a publicity campaign is also being started on festive occasions, in which people are being advised to give Khadi products as gifts
 iskaa kaichaline he- utsav yaa tyohaar, khaadi se acha kya uphaar
 The strategy is to woo the youth
 a detailed strategy is being chalked out to attract the youth towards khadi
 khaadi ke utpaadon se bhare vaahan ko college aadi jagahon par le jaakar bikri ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 For the first time, in addition to the 20 percent discount, a 5 percent discount has also been announced for students
 khaadi ko dizin karaane ke liye desh ke jane-maane dizinron, fishan institute ko is kaam se joda ja rahaa he
 The Modi government's plan through Khadi is to inculcate the spirit of Swadeshi among the youth as well as to promote employment at the village level
 shaharon main khaadi ke liye mcdonalds, barist aadi ke outlet par khaadi gramodyog bhawan ne coupon bhi rakhwane shuru kiye hai, jiske jariye chhot dekar logon ko aakarshith kiya ja rahaa he
 Why the Khadi Aayog: The Modi government is attracting the youth by introducing Khadi in a new category, but its other aspect is that immediately after coming to power, on 24 July, the Modi government dissolved the Khadi Village Industries Commission
 That a radical change will be brought in it
 lekin na to adhikari or naa hi mantri kisi badlaav kii baat sweekaar karte hai
 The process of re-constitution of this commission is going on, but Prime Minister Modi, who is engaged in the process of working fast, has not been able to restructure this commission
 jabaki sookshm laghu, madhyam udyog mantralay kaa 2014-15 kaa kul bajet 3702 karod rupee he to isamen akele khaadi gramodyog ayog kaa bajet 1932 karod rupee kaa he
 New Head of Khadi Commission? Union Minister Kalraj Mishra has met three times for the reorganization of Khadi Village Industries Commission, but Modi has advised him not to meet any person of the organization
 haalanki us vyakti ke naam kaa khulaasa nahin ho paa rahaa he, lekin jis tarah se kaam chal rahaa he usase saaf he ki abhi khaadi ayog ko nayaa adhyaksh milanaa aasaan nahin he
 At present, the Joint Secretary of the Ministry is in double role and he is also playing the role of CEO of Khadi Village Industries Commission
 jald hi vah tripal role main bhi najar aaenge, kyonki unhen hi adhyaksh kii bhi antarim jimmedaari die jane ke asaar hai
