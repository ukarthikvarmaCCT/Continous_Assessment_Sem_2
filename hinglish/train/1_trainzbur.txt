 In the Test match being played in Palekal, Younis Khan of Pakistan has shown the feat which neither Don Bradman, considered a legend in Test history, nor master blaster Sachin Tendulkar reached there
 aisa kya karnama kar dikhaaya, younus khan ne ye jaanane main aapaki dilchaspee ho gai hogi
 In fact, Younus Khan has the record of scoring the most centuries in the fourth innings of Test matches
 srilanka ke khilaaf younus khan ne test match kii chauthi pari main apana paanchvaan shatak jamaaya
 In this list, Sunil Gavaskar of India, Ricky Ponting of Australia, Ramnaresh Sarwan of West Indies and Graeme Smith of South Africa are second with four centuries

 Gavaskar said, "as far as the 2015 World Cup is concerned, there is still a lot of time in it but i believe that the break from captaincy will improve Dhoni more
 main yah nahin kah rahaa hum ki shrinkhalaa ke bich aisa karnaa chahie lekin australian shrinkhalaa ke baad yaa 2013 ke baad ke maheenon main aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 The veteran opener said that relaxation would give Dhoni a chance to consider his game and leadership
 unhone kaha, ‘yah vishram vah khud le sakate hai yaa unhen dilaayaa ja saktaa he
 But they need to give time to consider their game and make a good comeback
 vah jis tarah se ab bhi shantchit bane hue hai usase main prabhavit hum lekin thode samay ke liye vishram bura nahin hoga
 It is a great honor to captain India, but there are a lot of expectations and pressures attached to it
 ’gavaskar ne kaha ki yuva viraat kohli ko dhoni kii jagah captain banaaya ja saktaa he
 He said, 'I may be wrong but Virat Kohli can show the spirit of Tiger Pataudi under his captaincy
 yadi use pataa chalata he ki use lambey samay ke liye niyukt kiya gaya he to vah dynamik he tathaa usamen aakraamakata or kaushal he
 i like everything he does, but the way he gets abused after achieving an accomplishment is not at all like
 main nahin chahta ki vah iske alaava khud main koi badlaav kare
 According to reports, the national selectors have asked Dhoni to prepare a blueprint for the World Cup 2015, on which Gavaskar questioned
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe thodi hairaani hui kyonki chayansmiti kaa kaarykaal keval ek saal ke liye he or koi kaise aashwast ho saktaa he ki vah 2014 yaa 2015 kii team taiyaar karne ke liye vahaan rahegaa
 According to reports, coach Duncan Fletcher's contract will not be renewed after the Australian series and Gavaskar said that an Indian should be given this responsibility
 unhone kaha, ‘main chaahunga ki kisi bhartiya yaa phir gairi karston jaise khilaadi ko coach banaaya jaae
 If you have a champion cricketer, he can help you do better

 zahir srilanka main tej gendbaazon ke leader honge or sabase anbhavi tej gendbaaz hone ke kaaran wicket lene kii sabase zyada jimmedaari unheen ke kandhon par hogi
 No matter the circumstances, Zaheer specializes in swinging the ball and later reverse swing

 Umesh will have the ability to bounce and extract speed from the strength of his shoulders on Sri Lankan pitches
 khaastaur par nai gend kaa umesh ko bharpoor phayda uthaanaa hoga
 This is Umesh's first Sri Lankan tour, so he will also get a lot to learn
 vaise 15 vanade puraane umesh kaa vanade se zyada test main pradarshan abhi tak behatar rahaa he
 Vinay Kumar neither swings the ball too much nor does he have that speed in his balls
 lekin line length pakadakar gendbaazi karnaa or slo gend kaa behtareen istemaal karne kii kala unhen bakhubi aati he
 Vinay will be responsible for drying the runs in the middle overs
 tippaniyan Due to leg certs, taking the balls of Vinay lightly can also be a burden for Sri Lankan bowlers
 22 vanade puraane vinay kaa bhi ye pehla srilanka daura he or unke kariyar ke liye kaaphi ahm bhi kyonki srilanka kii zamin par pradarshan vinay ke kariyar kii disha kaaphi had tak tay kar degaa

 Dinda has all the qualities to be a good bowler and this time in Sri Lanka he will have to prove his utility
 zahir khan 4 maheene ke aaraam ke baad team india main vaapasi kar rahe hai
 Zaheer will be the leader of fast bowlers in Sri Lanka and being the most experienced fast bowler, the responsibility of taking wickets will be on his shoulders
 halaat chaahe kaise bhi hon lekin zahir gend ko swing or baad main reverse swing karaane main maahir hai
 Zaheer has proved to be effective against left-handed batsmen and Dhoni will rely on him to contain the in-form Sangakkara cheaply
 zahir kaa record bhi srilankai zamin par acha he
 Zaheer has played 32 matches in Sri Lanka and has taken 43 wickets at an average of around 29
 umesh yadav bharat ke sabase tej tarraar gendbaazon main se ek hai

 The comments leg courts kii vajah se vinay kii gendon ko halke main lenaa srilankai gendbaazon ko baari bhi pad saktaa he
 This is the first Sri Lanka tour of 22 one-day-old Vinay and also very important for his career as the performance on Sri Lankan land will determine the direction of Vinay's career to a great extent
 ipel or ranjai maichon main josh or jazbe se bharpoor is gendbaaz ne sabko prabhavit kiya he
 Ashok Dinda's name has been rocking the domestic circle for quite some time and it is time to prove himself internationally
 srilanka main 2010 main hue asia cap main dinda ko 1 match khilne kaa anubhav he
 Dinda was part of the team in the Asia Cup in 2012 but he did not do any good
 dinda ke paas acha gendbaaz hone ke saare gun maujuud he or srilanka main is baar unhen apni upyogita sabit kerani hi hogi
 No matter the circumstances, Zaheer specializes in swinging the ball and later reverse swing
 zahir baayen haath ke ballebaazon ke khilaaf kargaar sabit hue hai or in-form sangakaara ko saste main sametane ke liye dhoni unheen par bharosa karenge

 From the trailer of the upcoming film Hate Story 2, it seems that like the first film 'hate Story', it will also be an erotic film
 lekin film main mukhya bhoomika nibhaa rahe abhinayta jai bhanushaali iske ulat daleel dete hai
 He said that erotic scenes were shot in only one song of the film
 jai ne ek saakshaatkaar main bataaya, 'saaf taur par kahuun to 'het story 2' pehali film jaisi nahin he
 It was an erotic film, but it is a suspense thriller
 kuch ek antarang drishy hai, jo sirf ek gane main hai
 While the entire film runs on a story
 'jai ne kaha, 'film main 10 acchhee chijen hai or aakhri cheez antarang drishy he
 There are also nine other things, which you will see after the film is released on 18 July
 mujhe puraa yakeen he ki log film kii kahani or abhinay ke bare main baaten karenge na ki kaamuk drishyon ke bare main
 The film's song 'aaj Phir Tum Pe Pyaar' has enhanced Jai's image as an actor, and Jai is happy with it
 unhone kaha, 'pehle log mujhe maa ke laadle or pyaare ladke kehete the, lekin ab log mujhe aakarshak or kaamuk chhavi vaale abhinayta ke rup main dekhne lage hai

 By the time it got cold, we found that Ruia, the owner of Gadkari and Essar, was sitting peacefully, but the job of three journalists was lost, of which two were still reporters
 inhone apane saath hue bartaav kaa yah kehete hue virodh kiya ki ye kisi bhi gambhir aparaadh main lipt nahin the or inhen jis kaam ke liye bali kaa bakra banaaya gaya he, vah lalabatti paar karne se zyada bada maamla nahin he
 First of all, we need to understand that no matter how big a journalist is, he gets his story from someone related to corporate or from someone else, then it is more serious crime than crossing red light is
 muftakhori karnaa aparaadh he or hamaare peshey ke liye ghaatak he
 What do we think about journalists today, the establishment, government, corporate, and even ngos that get good grants? They feel that our ego is so big that it is not easy to frighten us and if we are caught we will gather and turn backward, but our pay is so low and the image is so modest that if they cannot buy us, then keep them on hire
 Can
 jansampark se jude shaatir log hameshaa hamaare kamjor palon kii taak main rahete hai: masalan, baccha yaa maa-baap biimaar hue, skool yaa college main daakhila karana ho, videsh yatra yaa shiksha kaa maamla ho
 It is imperative for a journalist to have firm intentions, vigilance and skill to deal with these things
 agar aap is imtihaan main naakaam hue to aapako sahanubhuti kii ummid nahin kerani chahie
 Despite this, some other issues are worth underlining
 pehle gadakari kii baat
 He has rested comfortably, arguing that this is when he was neither a public servant nor an MP nor BJP President
 iske alaava ve ruia parivaar ke puraane mitra or padosi hai, to aisa kya ho gaya
 His argument blew the story but those three journalists? Look at Prashant Bhushan's petition carefully
 ek or teen kii chaukadi ko milakar unhone netaaon, naukarshahon or media ke korporate jagat ke saath baari gathjod kii ek tasviir khinchi he
 They now want the court to set the standard for doing all these things
 dhyaan dijiega ki piiel main sirf ek netaa kaa zikr he jiske paas apane bachaav main baqayada yah kanoonee tark maujuud he ki vah us vakt locasevak nahin tha
 There is not a single bureaucrat in it
 phir, teen patrkaar hai jo hamaare liye sabase ahm hai: piiel main darkhwaast kii gai he ki korporate jagat ke saath media kii sanlagnta ko lekar kasuti tay kii jaae
 This is an invitation to the judicial restriction on the media and the most shocking thing is that we journalists have neglected this aspect, rather than trying to explain themselves as a stakeholder
 pichley 15 saal main jis tarah bhartiya patrakarita apane kad, takat or vetan-bhatton ke maamle main badi he, isaki chetana main kuch buree chijen bhi ai hai
 That is why whenever a scandal comes out about the journalists, its big faces also save themselves by saying, "go to hell, at least i did not do that, everyone else is a thief
" ’’ is tareeke se samoochaa pesha daagdar ho jaataa he or hamen gaali dene vaale khule ghoomte rahete hai
 The trend began with the Radia tape scandal, in which five journalists were found to be involved in dhatkras at different levels
 ham sab itnaa saham gaye ki ham yah bhi nahin kah sake ki radia ne jin saikadon patrakaron se baat kii hogi, unamem ye sirf paanch hai
 As a result of this, today our most successful, agitational and advocates of free voice are going to the Supreme Court and pleading for a court ban on the media
 essar se judi aisi koi bhi khabar badi hi hogi
 This is our second push after the Radia tape
 phir bhi badale main kuch hasil karne kaa koi sakshya nahin he, na hi in patrakaron ke kaam kii koi aisi gambhir padtaal kii gai he jo sabit karti ho ki inhone samjhaute kiye
 Editor's status is high, so it should be judged based on the standard applicable to it
 lekin ekaadh reportron kii maamuli or bevakoofana manamaani ke chalate apane peshey ko daagdar karne kii chhot dena apane ko sajaa dena bhar nahin he, balki media ke netritvkaari chehron kii kaayarta bhi he
 i know that there are dangers of saying this, but after the Emergency and during the reforms, journalists like us have got the credit for what our journalists have gained and we should stand up for them
 koi patrkaar vastav main kisi se laabh letaa yaa kisi ko prabhavit karata pakadaa jaataa he to galati maalikon or sampadakon kii bhi he
 The way media has expanded in recent years and it has grown in different directions, the stature of a professional editor has diminished considerably
 bhashaayi patrakarita main adhiktar sampadak khud maalik hai, lihaaja unka mul kaarobaar or samachar donon is tarah gutthamguttha he jaise hamaare chote shaharon kii galiyon main bijli ke taar aapas main uljhe hote hai
 Professional editors are still left today, but the owner / management wants the editor to be his or her own person and not someone who is associated with or named to the outside world
 hamaare yahaan ke sabase bade media santhaan main bhi sampadak agar khud apni biline se likhnaa chaahe to yah apriy baat hoti he
 This is the reason why 21st century choice editors who are unknown, of short stature and who are not in danger
 hamaare saare mukhyadhara ke angreji akhabaaron or paanch main se chaar rashtriya bijness akhabaaron main yaa to malikan khud sampadak hai yaa phir sampadak likhata nahin he
 This brings a shameful division within the newsroom where editors are held captive in their bunkers while poor reporters are left unharmed in the ruthless world of Radias and Ruias
 unase ummid kii jaati he ki ve khabaren lekar aaen jabaki sampadak ke paas un khabaron kii satyata kaa pataa lagane kaa tarika nahin hota
 In this way, an important aspect like checking and balancing is no longer seen in old-fashioned newsrooms
 inhen reportron ko company ke aayojanon ke liye ahm atithi laane kaa bhi kaam diya jaataa he jo aajkal media ke rajasav kaa ek ahm hissaa ho chalaa he
 The deterioration of the media as an institution or the rise of an unknown editor gives relief to the owner while disregarding the reporters
 aise main jab koi reporter galati karke fansata he to use sajaa bhugatne ke liye akelaa chhod diya jaataa he
 a journalist's relationship with a sutra is like a delicate and fine art that takes time to learn
 kisi lobist yaa dalal ke paas bhi sutara hote hai lekin patrkaar ko us sutara kaa bharosa jeetna padataa he or apni eemaandaaree, gopneeyata tathaa baudghikta kii takat ke sahare sammaan bhi hasil karnaa hota he
 If the editor remains isolated and disconnected from the world, then his reporter will be caught in the throats of leaking news, planting and even fake news
 reporter hameshaa se pyaadaa rahaa he lekin aaj vah sampadakon or malikan ko oonchi jagahon tak pahunchane, mehmaan bulaane or aayojanon ke liye praayojak dhund laane kaa aujaar ban gaya he
 At some places, he also has to do the work of getting land from state governments and getting business deals done
 is prakriya main naitikta or kaarobaar kii vibhaajak rekha mit jaati he or tathakthith visal bloron se kabhi-kabhaar aantarik kagajaat haath lag jate hai
 After this, it is the turn of the attacking gangs to become active
 yah sab aise vakt main ho rahaa he jab sutara aadhaarit patrakarita aparaadh ho jaae or file chhinana hi kala ban jaae; jab apane sutara viksit karne vaala reporter dalal kahalaane lage jabaki google or soshal media par baithkar nishthur vyabhichaar karne vaala shaks, jo suni-sunai baat ko patrakarita maanata he, wachdog ban jaae; to yah patrakarita kii maut he
 The death of that journalism, whose job is to go out and meet people and go to the middle of this dirty world, come back from there with great news
 hamaare newsroom main jo sankat he, vah muftakhori se badhkar kahin zyada vyapak he
 This crisis is of leadership and principles
 main jaanata hum ki newsroom bahut ast-vyast jagah hoti he
 Still it is a culinary place
 hamaare peshey main reporter or uske sutara ke bich bharose se zyada paak dhaagaa koi nahin hota, jise aajkal ham aksar tuutata hua dekh rahe hai
 Remember, when our source Sudhindra Kulkarni was jailed in the Lok Sabha vote exchange case, where did our professional outrage disappear
 unhone apni haalia bestceller main is maamle par saahas or eemaandaaree ke saath likhane kaa jajba to dikhaaya he
 He may have been the last editor to do so
 yah koi santosh kii baat nahin he

 credit card or vyaktigat karj ke latakate maamle bainkon ke liye ab pareshaani kaa sabab banane lage hai
 The country's largest bank, State Bank of India, has admitted that due to non-timely return of such loans, the pressure on such assets of banks has increased
 state bank ke adhyaksh omprakash bhatta ne mangalvaar ko kaha, ‘pichley do saalon main credit card or vyaktigat karjon ke maamle main bank parisampattiyon kii gunvattta main kaaphi giravat ai he, yah aane vaale samay main bainkon ke liye badi chunauti hogi

 vyaktigat karj vyakti vishesh ko nijee jarurat ke liye diya jaataa he
 This is not done for any special purchase and banks charge high interest rate on such personal loans
 bhatta ne derevative utpaadon or kaarobaar main bhi nuksaan par chintaa jataai
 He said that it also needs to be looked into
 bhatta ne bainkon main nakadi kii sthiti par kaha pichley dinon banking tantra main nakadi kii sthiti main baari utaar-chadhaav dekha gaya
 Describing the cash situation as uncertain, he said that in view of this, fund management is becoming a challenge for banks
 bhatta bainkon ke sanghathan bhartiya bank sangh ke bhi adhyaksh hai
 He said that in view of the high aspirations of the youth, there are wide possibilities of growth in the coming days
 aise main bainkon ko vibhinn muddon par gaur karnaa chaiye
 The right staff and leadership should be developed so as to meet the growing expectations of the customers
 unhone kaha ki aane vaale dinon main awaas rin kshetra bainkon ke liye vruddhi paane kaa pramukh kshetra hoga

 The comments chandigarh main yojit ek kaarykram se itar deepak ne kaha ki spectrum kii kami kol drop kii samasya ke peeche ek ahm vajah he
 We have recently auctioned spectrum and this will almost end the spectrum shortage
 ab jab doorsanchaar sevapradaata chah se aath maheene main network kaa vistaar karenge to kol drop se badi raahat milegi

 haalanki, bijepi ekamat rup se yah jaruri kahati he ki ram mandir unki aasthaa kaa vishay he or iskaa nirmaan hokar rahegaa
 At present, this case, which has been identified as the biggest issue in the country, has been in court for decades, which has now reached the threshold of the Supreme Court

 India will have to choose thoughtfully in the spin department

 in / bharat ke khilaaf test siries ke baaki maichon ke liye australian team ke nae captain steven smith honge
 Smith, who scored 162 not out in the first innings of the Adelaide Test and 52 not out in the second innings, will now be under pressure to bat as well as captain
 australian captain maaikel clark ke chotil hone kii vajah se smith ko yah jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 He is the youngest member of the current team, yet he has been made the captain of the team
 vah australian cricket itihaas ke 45wein test captain honge
 The strange coincidence is that Virat Kohli will be handing the captaincy baton back to his senior Mahendra Singh Dhoni from the Indian side in Brisbane, on the other hand the Australian camp will be holding the baton of responsibility to its future captain
 yah australian chayansmiti kii doordarshita hi he ki unhone bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue smith ko clark ke vikalp ke taur pesh kiya he
 It was previously believed that the team's current wicket-keeper batsman and vice-captain Brad Haddin would be named the new captain of the team, but Australian Marshal selection committee chief Rod Marsh has revealed that the selection committee has taken the responsibility of captaincy into account for a long time Keeping young Smith has decided to make him captain
 rod marsh ke mutabik, bread hadine jis tarah se maaikel clark ke dipti kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe the, usee tarah ve steven smith ko apana samarthan dete rahenge
 On the other hand, Steven Smith himself has been surprised by the Australian selection committee's decision
 unhen ye andaja tha ki team prabandhan bread hadine ko hi captain banayega
 But when he got a call from Rod Marsh for captaincy, he couldn't believe it
 haalanki baad main smith ne kaha ki, captaini kaa unka sapana puraa ho rahaa he or ye soch kar ve behad romanchit hai
 Actually, the last 18 months have been very successful for Steven Smith
 unhone is dauraan 12 test maichon main paanch shatak jamaaye hai
 His claim to captaincy strengthened due to his amazing performance with the batting
 ab tak smith ne australia kii ore se 23 test match khele hai or isamen kareeb 46 kii ausat se 1749 ran banaae hai
 At the age of just 25, Smith is becoming the captain of Australia
 steven smith australia ke tisare sabase yuva captain hai
 Before that, Kim Hues and Ian Craig have become captains at the age of 24, but during the series against India, they are the youngest players in their team and will have to take their seniors along
 is chunauti ko lekar steven smith chintit nahin hai
 According to him, he will continue to get 100 percent support from his seniors
 steven smith ne bharosa dilaayaa he ki unki team puri series main aakraamak khel kaa pradarshan karegi
 He has told the Australian media that he will do better on his own as a captain so that he can lead his team from the front
 notebandi kaa ek saal puraa ho rahaa he
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is a constant attacker on the central government

 But in the intervening times, Manmohan Singh also praised a move of the Modi government
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne jo ricapitaliseshan kaa kadam uthaaya he, vah swaagat yogya he or is kadam kii kaaphi zarurat thi
 Explain that the central government has given a boost to the banking sector
 11 lakh karod rupye ke ricapitaliseshan (punarpunjikaran) lon ko manjuuri di thi
 Post demonetisation-gst-economy, PM surrounded the Modi government on every issue
 unhone kaha ki jiesti ko laane ke liye hamaari soch thi ki tex system ko saral karnaa
 So that small businessmen can benefit, but nothing happened in this GST
 is sarkaar ne hamaari baat hi nahin suni
 This GST has become like a nightmare
 gujarat pahunche manmohan ne modi ko dilaai gandhi kii yaad, puche 7 sakht sawalkya tha centre sarkaar kaa faislaapako bataa den ki centre sarkaar ne banking sector ko boost dene ke liye 2

 At the same time when the Chief Minister of Bihar was holding a review meeting on liquor ban, a doctor of Patna Medical College Hospital, a few kilometers away from the Secretariat, was drinking alcohol in the hostel
 mukhyamantri sharaab taskari main hue ijaphe ke liye police or aabkaari vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko fatkaar laga rahe the, udhar doctor paig par paig chadaaye ja rahaa tha
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was holding a review meeting on liquor ban till late Wednesday evening
 unhone police ko sharabbandi abhiyaan tej karne kaa nirdesh bhi diya, lekin bihar ke sabase bade aspataal piemasiech ke doctor ne hi bihar sarkaar ke sharabbandi kanoon kii dhajjiyaan uda deen
 In fact, late Wednesday night, the Pirbahore police station of Patna arrested the PMCH KPG doctor Akhilesh Kumar in a drunken state, where the quantity of alcohol was found in the investigation from the Breath Analyzer
 police ke anusaar akhilesh kaa kahana tha ki use kisi ne sharaab pilaa diya he
 However, Dr
 Akhilesh himself has denied drinking alcohol and said that he had a fight with some doctors
 sharaab pine ke dauraan aarakshan ke mudde lekar doctoron ke do guton ke bich kahasuni hui or maamla hathapayee tak pahunch gaya, tab kisi ne isaki soochna police ko de di
 The police had reached to settle the quarrel
 police ke aane kii soochna se baaki doctor to faraar ho gayi, lekin divyang hone ke kaaran doctor akhilesh bhaag nahi sake or pakade gaye
 Despite full prohibition in the state, the government has announced harsh action against liquor mafia, unhappy with the open trade of liquor
 saath main nirdesh main ye bhi kaha gaya ki sharaab mafiaon kii sampati nilaam kii jaae aursharab mafiaonke saath gathjod karne vaale afasaron ko barkhaast kiya jaae
 Describing politics as the ladder of socio-economic transformation of the country, Bharatiya Janata Party President Nitin Gadkari said that his party has the ability to change the face of the country in three years
 apni pustak ‘vikaas ke raah par’ ke punjabi sanskaran ‘vikaas de raah te’ ke vimochan ke maukey par yojit samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue gadakari ne kaha, ‘bhartiya janata party agar satta main aati he to desh kii surat teen saal main badal jaaegi

 The increase in inflation is also the reason
 ’ bhaajapa pramukh ne kaha ki desh main saath hajaar crores kaa anaaj har saal sad rahaa he lekin use garibon main nahin baanta ja saktaa
 When the court intervened and said that divide it among the poor, the government silenced it by saying that it was the right of the government to distribute food grains
 ’gadakari ne kaha, ‘raajnneeti saamaajik or aarthik vikaas kii seedhee he
 It is not a means of earning money
 isliye desh main pragati or vikaas kii raajnneeti kii jaae to yah jaat, panth, dharm, ling or bhashaa kii raajnneeti ko beasar kar sakati he
 This is most essential to take the country on the path of development
 ’bhaajapa pramukh ne yah bhi kaha, ‘desh kii surat badalane ke liye hamen jaat, panth, dharm, ling or bhashaa ke aadhaar par bhedbhaav nahin karnaa chahie
 We need to spend time on how to eradicate poverty from the country and society
 ’ bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki kisi bhi desh ke vikaas ke liye jaruri he udyog or krishi
 Water, electricity, traffic and communication system are necessary for the development of both these things

 He alleged that the country's economic situation has collapsed
 antarrashtriya bazaar main rupaye kaa avamulyan lagaataar ho rahaa he
 The dollar has risen from Rs 38 to Rs 54
 sarkaar ke paas in chizon se paar paane kii koi drushti nahin he yahi kaaran he ki arthvyavastha lagaataar ladkhada rahi he or ham kuch kar sakane kii sthiti main nahin he
 Gadkari said that the country is not poor
 hamaare shaskaon kii soch garib ho gayi he
 Therefore, the government-run businesses have started doing business
 unhone kaha ki raja agar vyapaaree ho jaae to janata bhikhaari ho jaaegi
 This is the condition of the country today
 unhone kaha, ‘ham mil kar or saamaajik samvedansheeltaa ke saath kaam karen to samaaj kii sthiti badal sakati he
 We have such an economic vision and system that if the BJP comes to power, then the appearance of the country will change in three years

 abhi tak aam aadmi party ne kisi ummidavaar ke naam kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he, lekin party ke netaaon kii mahatvakanksha soshal media se lekar sadakon par najar aane lagi he
 a picture of this battle of aspirations was seen on Thursday when the third strong leader of the party and the supporters of Kavikumar Biswas came to camp in Aam Aadmi Party's office with Bibora and Tents
 haathon main takhtiyaan liye vishwaas samarthak party alaakaman se kumaar vishwaas ko rajyasabha bhejne kii maang kar rahe the
 Not only faith, there are many such leaders in the Aam Aadmi Party who are eyeing these three Rajya Sabha seats of Delhi, waiting for Kejriwal's decision
 ek taraf party ke netaa apane man kii muraad puri hone kaa intjaar kar rahe hai to vahiin party dilli kii teen rajyasabha siton ke liye party ke baahar jane maane chehron par charchaa kar rahi he
 Sources present in the Aam Aadmi Party had already told Aaj Tak that the party is considering faces from outside the party for these three Rajya Sabha seats in Delhi
 netaaon ke bich takaraav na ho is liye kejariwal desh ke alag-alag kshetron main kaam karne vaale diggaj netaaon ko rajyasabha bhejnaa chaahate hai
 This on one hand can prevent fight fights within the party
 vahiin, duusari ore visheshgyon ko rajyasabha main bhejkar aam aadmi party rashtriya str par rashtriya muddon ko lekar apni gambhirtha or sakriyata kaa pradarshan karnaa chaahati thi
 The party wants those seats in the Rajya Sabha to face those who can not only surround the Modi government on every front but can also answer the questions in the House
 kejariwal rajya sabha main dilli ko purna rajya or sanvaidhanik adhikaron kaa mudda bhi haaavee rakhana chaahate hai
 According to the information received by Aaj Tak, the churning is still going on between the top leaders of the party whether it is to send the leaders inside the party or anyone from outside in the upper house of Parliament

 Another situation in the party is that if their own leaders were to be sent to the Rajya Sabha, who could be those faces
 daavon ke vipareet aam aadmi party kii netaa or purv banker mira sanyaal in chehron main sabase aage hai
 At the same time, Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh are considered the most strong contenders for the remaining 2 seats

 There are claims and hopes of the faith supporters but the party has not yet discussed his name

 na to bread khaane se fibre miltaa he, na to grence kaa puraa phayda
 In a way, no nutrients go into our body
 agar aap bread kii aadat ko chhod nahin sakate hai to white bread kii jagah hole-grain bread khaanaa shuru kar dijie
 It is comparatively better
 2

 ' Kiran Bedi's entry into Delhi's politics has become interesting
 eemaandaar chhavi vaale do purv prashasnic adhikari, jo kabhi sahyogi andolankaaree bhi the, aaj aamane-saamne hai
 Kiran Bedi is now preparing to rally in all 70 Delhi assemblies
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vah 20 janvari se chunaav prachaar shuru karengi or rojaanaa 5 vidhansabha kshetron main raily karengi
 Key to 'make in India' and 'innovate in India' as said by @ pmoindiawill happen when 'we-the-'made-in-india' commit to 'MAKE INDIA'
 
 
 !— Kiran Bedi (@thekiranbedi)january 17, 2015lets Give India our next 3 years, WILLING hard work,innovation, commitment,integrity,next 2 years onwards,~it will start Making us
 Pl TRY !
 — Kiran Bedi (@thekiranbedi)january 17, 2015kiran bedi ne sanket die hai ki vah narendra modi kii tarah hi soshal media ko bhi chunavi astr banaaengi
 Even on Saturday morning, Kiran Bedi tweeted that if we give India three years of hard work and commitment, then after next two years, it will start our construction
 kiran kaa atake, kejariwal abhi narmakabhi congress-bijepi ke netaaon ko ek saath nishane par lene vaale arvind kejariwal or kiran bedi ab ek duusare ke khilaaf utar aae hai
 As far as the attack on each other is concerned, Kiran Bedi's attitude is just a matter of time
 lekin arvind kejariwal ab tak kiran bedi kii sidhi aalochana se bachate najar aa rahe hai
 The companions of the Jan Lokpal movement are now face to face in the political arena
 jin matbhedon par kabhi adarsh or usulon ke parde main baat hoti thi, ve ab khulkar saamne aa rahe hai
 For Kiran Bedi, this decision was not just to join politics
 unhen maaloom tha ki sidhaa muqabla apane puraane sahyogiyon se hona he
 So she seems more ready for direct criticism
 pehle din to vah kejariwal se jude sawaalon kii andekhi karti raheen, lekin agle hi din unke tevar badal gaye
 He directly questioned Kejriwal's political methods, not Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party
 koun kar rahaa nakaaratmak raajnneeti?unhone kaha, 'vah nakaaratmak raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 i am positive main surya se urja leti hum
 Greet the sun daily and believe in change
 main samay kii keemat jaanati hum or mujhe maaloom he ki ise invest kiya jaataa he, west nahin
 There has not been a formal decision on Kiran Bedi's election and the CM candidate, nor has any statement been issued by the party
 lekin aise sanket jarur mil rahe hai
 On the confrontation with Kejriwal, Kiran Bedi said, 'collision? Now it's not about the collision
 takkar ek haadasa he or chunaav ek chois he
 Choose the person you want to vote by voting
 'vahiin, kiran bedi ko lekar arvind kejariwal abhi kadi aalochana nahin kar rahe hai
 He welcomed Kiran Bedi's arrival in politics and wished him all the best
 haalanki iske baad unhone jawaab dete hue yah jarur kaha ki vah nakaaratmak raajnneeti nahin kar rahe hai
 Prime Minister from Ramlila Maidan and today Kiran ji and Shazia also said that we are doing 'negative' politics

 It is certain that by raising the stakes of Kiran Bedi just before the election, the BJP has increased Kejriwal's challenge

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) After the Ghazipur landfill accident, the East MCD is now eyeing the land of Ghonda Gurjan Khadar in North East Delhi, which the DDA has entrusted to the Corporation to build a landfill site, but the Corporation faces many challenges before building a landfill site here Have to deal with, which does not look so easy
 aapako bataa den ki didie ne ghonda gurjan khadar main kareeb 150 acre jameen east emsidi ko saunpi to he, lekin yamuna nadi se isaki nazadiiki paryaavaran ke lihaaj se to khatarnaak he hi, vahiin aasapaas rahane waalon ne bhi is par abhi se aapatti jataana shuru kar diya he
 When Aajtak visited the land of this proposed landfill site, he found that there are many reasons which pose a challenge to the corporation
 nigam ke saamne sabase badi chunauti hoga yahaan bhoojal pradooshan ko rokna hoga
 Due to the rain on this land, there is a lot of water that slowly seeps into the ground
 ab yadi yahaan landphil site bani uskaa pani yahaan ke zamin main ris-ris kar use pradooshit karegaa, jiskaa sidhaa asar is site ke thik saamne basii coloniyon main rahane vaale lakhon logon par padegaa
 The proposed landfill site adjacent to the Yamuna river would prove to be the biggest impediment in the direction
 ye zamin yamuna flud plane main aati he, jisamen yamuna kii baadh ke dauraan kaaphi pani aata he
 If a landfill site is built here, the threat to the already polluted Yamuna will increase further
 prastaavit landphil site ke paas hi van evam vanya jeev vibhaag kii jameen he, jahaan badi sankhya main bans, jamun, shisham, arjuna ke ped hai jinke khatm hone kii ashanka he
 Apart from natural reasons, people living here have another reason to oppose the proposed landfill site and that is cricket
 ji haa, is ilaake main rahane vaale hajaaron yuvaaon ke liye ye zamin khel kaa ek bada maidan bhi he, jahaan wo cricket khilne aate hai
 They say that if a landfill site is built here, their playground will be destroyed and they will have to go to Burari or Mukherjee Nagar, several kilometers away to play cricket, because there is no such big playground in north east Delhi
 in sab ke alaava yahaan ke sthaniyasansad bhiprastaavit landphil site ke khilaaf he or inaki khilaafat karnaaemasidi cebus kii baat nahi, kyonki ye saansad usee bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh hai jisaki nigam main satta he
 According to MP Manoj Tiwari, he has a deep attachment to Yamuna and he does not want a landfill site to be built here
 manoj tiwari ke mutabik yahaan landphil site banane se yamuna main gandagi jaaegi jo koi nahi chahega
 He said that he would talk to the corporation and ask him to move the proposed landfill site to some other place

 aazaadee ke baad kya hota he?desh ke log apni sarkaar banaate hai
 After independence, who poses the biggest threat to independence? From the government! This dialogue with a professor of political science laughter was often repeated and left with questions
 videshi takat kii gulaami se mukt hote hi,kisi bhi desh ke liye aazaadee ke matlab puri tarah badal jate hai
 After getting rid of slavery, "their" governments have to continuously increase the independence of their people
 desh ke prati nagarikon kaa daayitv bodh is hakeekat par nirbhar hota he ki unki sarkaron ne unki aazaadiyon ko kis tarah sajaayaa va sanvaara
 India has a unique tradition of social, ideological and economic freedoms that colonialism had limited so that this dynamic country could be ruled
 ab jabaki har pramukh rajnatik dal yaa vichaardhaara kii satta main awajahi ho chuki he tab aazaadee ke sattar saal ke maukey par yah dekhnaa jaruri he ki hamaare hakimon ne bhartiya samaaj kii aitihaasik swadhinataon se kya siikhaa or use kitna badhaayaa yaa sanvaara he?bharat ek tha magar ekarup nahin
 The British, for their rule, were trying to beat this complex country and make it equal

 Some of these variations were hindered in development and some in nationalism

 In order to compete with a powerful and independent society, the British rulers had equipped the powers with immense powers
 aazaadee ke baad ai sarkaron ne satta kii takat badhaane kaa mauka nahin chukaa
 Governments continued to spread and conflict between constitutional institutions became a permanent feature of India
 aazaadee ko sirf bachaana hi nahin,badhanaa bhi hota he
 After liberation from slavery, America made new efforts to increase freedom which became the norm for the world

 Apart from the pressure of staying in power for 10 years, SAD has some of the toughest challenges before it — dealing with the increasingly confrontational attitude of the alliance partner BJP, the fast-growing influence of Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party, which led to former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu can also join him, the growing emphasis of the Congress under the leadership of former Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, and the notion that Punjab will be Being carried and are becoming waste being a victim of its youth drugs

 Edited excerpts: Can the possibility of Navjot Singh Sidhu joining the Aam Aadmi Party pose a threat to your party? There is no danger
 akaliyon ne hi hameshaa unhen bachaaya he
 Look at their parliamentary (election) record, they only won from Akali influence seats (assembly constituency)
 pichhali baar (2009) jab ve ek lakh voton kii badhat se ghatakar 4,000 par aa gaye the to ve shahar (amritsar) se haar gaye the or akali kshetron se jite the
 He himself admitted in an interview that he had won because of the Akali Dal
 ab 'aap' ko dekhie
 Jinne Comedian Haige (all comedian) is going into it
 bheed unke paas manoranjan ke liye aati he
 Fighting an electoral battle is a different thing

 What have he (sidhu) done? Just look at the record, how much time he has spent in Parliament and how much time he has given for his auditions
 agar kamedi hi myne rakhti he to sabhi mukhyamantri kamedian rahe hote
 How do you see the success of AAP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections? He was just a one-time charisma
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke turant baad talavandi sabo (bhatinda jila) main vidhansabha ke upachunaav main ve apni jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa paae the
 After that he had decided not to contest any elections, so now his bubble has burst
 kejariwal bahut bade taanashaah hai
 First they won in the name of Anna Hazare
 unhone turant un logon ko baahar kar diya, jinhen ve apane liye chunauti samajhate the
 Even the people of 'AAP' say that they are very big dictators
 'aap' keval ek aadmi kii party he
 Just look at his statements: He said that he will not enter politics, will never contest elections, he vowed to his child that if AAP does not get majority, they will not support anyone, nor will they support anyone, their The MLA would not take any kind of facilities, and then he paid his salary of Rs 50,000
 se badhaakar 2 lakh ru
 Tax, which is more than any state in the country
 kejariwal ko punjab ke mukhyamantri ke taur par pesh kiye jane kii baat chal rahi he
 They want to use Punjab for their fight against Prime Minister (narendra) Modi
 dilli main ve ek tarah se sirf ek nagarpalika samiti ke adhyaksh hai
 Therefore, they want a state where they have control over the police so that they can fight daily against PM Modi
 phir yahaan se ve duusare rajyon kii taraf baduya chaahate hai
 For them, Punjab is just a battleground, not their destination
 aakhir main ve punjab ko barbaad kar denge kyonki rajyon ko centre ke saath dostana sambandh banaakar rakhane kii jarurat hoti he
 For example, agriculture is the backbone of Punjab's economy
 gehun or chaaval kii sarkari kharid ke liye bharat sarkaar ke samarthan kii jarurat hoti he—agar barish ho jaati he or nami paidaa ho jaati he to niyamon main riyaayat ke liye, nakadi udhaar seemaa ke liye
 If there is always a fight going on (with the Center), then chaos will spread among the farmers
 punjab jaise simavarti rajya ke liye yah bahut kharaab sthiti hogi
 And what will Kejriwal do? They will sit on the dharna
 kejariwal darasal andar se ek arajak aadmi hai
 See, who are with them - people associated with radical, terrorist organizations, people who proclaimed Khalistan, they are their supporters
 to aap kah rahe hai ki kejariwal algaavvaadiyon ke saath mil rahe hai?ve sikh vot hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 By dividing the Sikhs as in the era of Indira Gandhi
 doosraa, naksali sanghathan 'aap' kaa hissaa hai
 In this way there are dangerous people with them, who want to destabilize this state under the umbrella of 'AAP'
 yahi vajah he ki unki lokapriyata kaa graph girnaa shuru ho gaya he
 Like Delhi (in Punjab) they are promising that they will create 25 lakh jobs
 do saal se mukhyamantri pad par hote hue unhone koi bhi vaada puraa nahin kiya he
 Kejriwal's face has been exposed
 punjab main kejariwal yaa unki 'aap' party chunaav main kuch bhi nahin kar paaegi
 The country needs sensible people

 The prospects for an alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections are not over yet
 dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne ravivaa ko kaha ki narendra modi or amit shah ko haraane ke liye kuch bhi karenge

 However, this time the party has withdrawn the demand of Punjab from the alliance formula
 sisodiya ne kaha tha, ‘modi or shah kii jodi desh ke liye khatarnaak he
 To stop this, AAP is ready to join hands with all anti-bjp organizations
 abhi bhi vaqt he, agar congress chaahe to modi or shah kii jodi ko 18 siton (haryana, dilli or chandigarh) par haraaya ja saktaa he
 It is for the Congress to decide whether the priority is to defeat the modi-shah duo or to set a record of fighting more seats
 ' gauratlab he ki aap abhi tak punjab, haryana or dilli kii 33 siton par congress ke saath gathbandhan kii baat kar rahi thi
 Let us tell you, the Aam Aadmi Party had formally announced an alliance with Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) in Haryana on Friday, while the Congress had only made it clear the compulsion to tie up with AAP in Delhi
 iske baad sisodiya ne gathbandhan ko lekar aap ke rukh ko spasht karte huye samvaadadaataaon ko bataaya ki unki party desh ke liye khatra ban chuki shah modi kii jodi ko phir se satta main aane se rokane ke liye congress sahit anya bhaajapa virdohi dalon ke saath milakar chunaav ladane ko taiyaar he
 He said that despite innate opposition to the Congress, AAP has taken the initiative of coalition in view of the present situation

 agar aapako lagata he ki shaadi se pehle shaareerik sambandh banane se aap donon ke bich pyaar or gaharaa hoga to aapako bataa den ki rishte ko majbootee dene kaa yah vikalp kahin se bhi sahi nahin he
 According to experts, in many cases, having a physical relationship before marriage can be harmful
 shaadi se purv sambandh banane se kai aisi baaten ho sakati hai jo aapke rishte ko ek dardanaak mode par laa sakati hai
 Apart from the hurt of feelings, the risk of STD (sexual Transmitted Disease) is also increased if the relationship is broken on tomorrow
 vahiin ladakiyon ko pregnent hone par kai tarah kii pareshaaniyaan jhelni padati hai
 Apart from this, these 3 reasons also prove that having a relationship before marriage is not physically, mentally and emotionally correct: 1
 yah charitra se judi baat ho sakati hehamaare desh main shaadi ke pahaleshareerik sambandhon ko sahi najar se nahin dekha jaataa
 So society does not accept this relationship
 jiske parinamswaroop ladke or ladki, donon ko hi samaajik chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 2
 anchaaha garbhashaadi ke purv sambandh bananaa isliye bhi khatarnaak he kyonki is dauraan garbh thaharne kii puri ashanka hoti he
 While it is not acceptable socially, boys and girls are not ready for any such situation
 aise main yah sthiti donon ke liye musiibat ban sakati he
 3
 pachhataave kii bhavanam lijie shaadi se pehle aapke kisi ke saath shaareerik sambandh rahe hon lekin aap us shaks se shaadi na kar paaen ho to yah gilt jeevanabhar aapako pareshaan rakhega
 Apart from this, you will also remain afraid that if your partner finds out about this, then your married life will be ruined

 But many people do not know about this section 307
 aaie sankshep main jaanane kii koshish karte hai ki kya he bhartiya dand samhita yani indian panel code or uski dhara 307
 Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, when a person tries to kill another person
 or vah hatya karne main naakaam rahata he
 So there is a provision to punish the person who committed such an offense under Section 307 of Section 307 IPC
 aasaan lafjon main kahen to agar koi kisi kii hatya kii koshish karata he, lekin jis shaks par hamalaa hua he, uski jaan nahin jaati to is tarah ke maamle main hamalaa karne vaale shaks par dhara 307 ke adheen mukadmaa chalata he

 Especially after India became independent there was a big change
 pakistan or bangladesh ne bhi bhartiya dand samhita ko hi apanaaya
 In a similar fashion, this legislation was also implemented in Burma, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, etc
, which came under the British rule

 loksabhaa main teen talaak par bahes ke dauraan bijepi saansad rama devi par aapattijanak tippanee ke maamle main aaj ahm din he
 Today, Samajwadi Party MP from Rampur Azam Khan can apologize in this matter
 lekin bada sawaal ye he ki kya loksabhaa spikar om birla or shivahar se bijepi saansad rama devi is maafee ko sweekaar karenge?rama devi ne 26 july ko kaha tha ki maafee maangane kaa vakt ab guzar chukaa he
 Speaking to India Today, he had said, "I, the speaker and many mps asked him to apologize, but he did not apologize then, instead he walked out of the House, which shows that he has Words are not rubbish and they are very important, they would have apologized at the same time if they were truthful
 " rama devi ne kaha ki ve ajam khan kii maafee ko sweekaar nahin karengi
 On July 25, during the debate on triple talaq in the Lok Sabha, Rama Devi was presiding over the House, when Azam Khan made controversial remarks
 ajam khan ke is bayaan ko sapa chhodkar sabhi dalon ke saansadon ne sansadeey garima or loktantric maryaadaaon ke khilaaf qaraar diya tha
 Women mps of the House had raised objection to this statement by rising above the party line
 bijepi saansad smriti irani, nirmala sitaraman ke alaava, kanimojhi, anupriya patel, supriya sule, navaneet rana or mimi chakravarti ne is ghatana kii ninda kii or ajam khan ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii he
 Please tell that Azam Khan's comment has been removed from the Lok Sabha records
 loksabhaa adhyaksh ke daftar se india today ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik ajam khan ko kaha gaya he ki ve somvaar ko sadan kii kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle spikar om birla se milen
 It is likely that Azam Khan will be asked to apologize to Rama Devi on the floor of the House, if they do not do so, then the process of action against Azam Khan will be initiated in a zero period
 sutara bataate hai ki is maamle main spikar samaajawaadee party ke varisht netaa or saansad mulaayam singh yadav kii raay le sakate hai
 On Friday, the speaker had a meeting with leaders of all parties on this issue
 mana ja rahaa he ki spikar om birla ajam khan ko bijepi saansad rama devi se maafee maangane ke liye kahenge
 If they do not do so, the speaker will be free to take action against Om Birla

 devaria jile ke salempur kshetra main sarkari primary skool ke naam parivartit kar adarsh islamia primary skool karne or shuukravaar ko vidhyalay band rakhane kii baat saamne aane ke baad mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne sakht lahaze main kaha ki is prakaar kii sharaarat ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Schools in the state will not remain as any caste or religion
 yogi ne kaha ki primary skool basic shiksha parishad ke antargat hi rahenge
 The identity of the primary school will remain the same
 kisi jati yaa majahab ke rup main vidyalayon kii pahchaan nahin hogi
 Any such action will not be tolerated
 bataa den ki devaria jile ke salempur tehsil ke navalpur gaanv main sthit primary skool ke building main vidhyalay kaa naam primary skool kii jagah islamia praathmik vidhyalay navalpur main tabdeel kar diya
 Not only this, the school is closed on Fridays instead of Sundays
 ek tarah se sarkari skool ko madrase main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 As soon as this was revealed, there was a stir in the Basic Education Department
 devaria ke jiladhikari sujith kumaar ne basic shiksha adhikari se jaanch patrawali talab karte hue is maamle kii jaanch kar karrwai kaa aadesh diya
 Subsequently, District Basic Education Officer Santosh Kumar Pandey, on investigation, found that the name of the school on the papers and register is Government Primary School while the school board is written as Islamia Primary School
 devaria jile main abhi tak aise 6 skool saamne aae hai jinhone khud ko sarkari niyamon se alag karte hue rajkeey praathmik vidhyalay kii jagah islamia praathmik vidhyalay main tabdeel kar liya
 Not only this, these government schools are being run entirely on the lines of madrasas, where religious slogans and religious writings have been found on the walls of schools
 vidhyalay main bacchon ke naam or shikshakon ke hastakshar or padhai sab kuch urdu main ho rahi thi
 Basic Education Officer Santosh Kumar Pandey said that during the investigation, 6 schools have been found which have changed their names and were silently running on the lines of madrasas
 is baat kii jaanch kii ja rahi he ki ye sab kisne or kab se he
 Though again converted to primary school, the names have been removed and instead of Friday, Sunday will be a holiday
 unhone kaha ki jinhone bhi ye kiya he unke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 There are six Islamia primary schools in Deoria district
 inamen islamia praathmik vidhyalay navalpur, islamia adarsh praathmik vidhyalay karamha, islamia praathmik vidhyalay samipattee, islamia praathmik vidhyalay pokharbhinda, islamia praathmik jaitpura or islamia praathmik haraiya shaamil he
 The headmasters of the schools informed that the schools are closed on Fridays
 skulon ke naam main islamiyaalikhane kii parampara 1904 se he, jabase ye vidhyalay hai
 It has been running since then
 bataa den ki yah sabhi skool basic shiksha vibhaag ke andar aate hai
 Here all the teachers come from Muslim class, these schools have been renamed to Islamia Primary School
 yahaan teacher kii upasthiti bhi urdu main darj hoti he yahaan shuukravaar ke din skool band hota he or ravivaar ke din khulaa hota he
 School teachers say that this has been going on for many years
 iske liye koi sarkari aadesh nahin he, yahanmuslim samudaayake 60 se 80 pratishat bachche padhate hai
 For this reason this arrangement has been made
 darasal maamla mid de mile kii audit se iskaa khulaasa hua he
 Every day all schools in the state have to send data to the government for the attendance of students in the mid-day meal, but the attendance of students in these schools on every Friday would be zero
 jabaki in skulon main he ravivaar ko mid de mile diya jaataa tha
 It was revealed in this audit that there are some schools which are running on Sundays
 isse vibhaag ke kaan khadey hue
 It was then revealed that the school is being run according to the traditions of a particular community
 haalanki skulon ke shikshak or praadhyaapak yah kah rahe hai ki aisa skulon main muslim chaatro kii bahulata ko dekhte hue kiya gaya he lekin yah kab se chalaa aa rahaa he kisi ko sach pataa nahin he
 Now the whole matter is under investigation
 darasal yah puraa maamla tab khulaa jab salempur ke khand shiksha adhikari ne yah dekha ki islamia praathmik vidhyalay, navalpur main mid de mile main shuukravaar ko chaatro kii sankhya shunya darshaya ja rahaa he or ravivaar ko register main baccho ko khaanaa diya ja rahaa he
 Islamabad School Headmaster Khurshid Ahmed says - We have come in 2008, it has been happening since then
 jabaki hamase pehle bachia devi thi unke samay main bhi isi tarah se chal rahaa tha
 The school dates back to 1904 and has been following tradition ever since
 aamir khan or salmaan khan kii jodi ko 'andaaj apana apana' ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 Released in 1994, the film did not do well at the box office at that time
 lekin ye kamedi film kuch saalon ke dauraan kalt clasik main tabdeel ho gai thi or aaj bhi kai phens is film ko salmaan or aamir kii chemistry ke liye hi yaad karte hai
 However, just like the film, Salman and Aamir have one such offscreen chemistry, which is very fun
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan jab aamir se poocha gaya ki salmaan ne ek baar bataaya tha ki aap auto ke paise nahin dete hai? tab aamir ne ek kissa sunaaya tha, "ek baar maine or salmaan ne sharaab pi rakhi thi or ham gum rahe the
 Then i did not pay the autowale and it happened because i never keep cash with me
 ""main hameshaa kiran se paise maangata hum yaa phir meraa manager hota he jiske paas cash hota he to jarurat padane par main usase paise maang letaa hum
 But i do not keep the cash with me
 to us din koi tha nahin, to meri jagah salmaan ko paise dene pad gaye the

 ) Who does not know Bachchan Rai now? inter topper ghotaalaa ujagar hone ke baad bihar hi nahin deshbhar main uski charchaa hui
 The same kid Rai who has hollowed out the root of the entire education system in Bihar
 baccha raay inter topper ghotaalaa ke baad ek baar phir surkhiyon main he
 How much the Bihar officials were kind to Bacha Rai was revealed by a document found till date
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi kibaccha raayke farji degree college ko bihar ke nigaraanee vibhaag ne clin chit de di gai thi
 At the time when the fake degree college of Bachha Rai was given a clean chit after conforming to the standard, then the head of surveillance was PK Thakur, who is currently DGP of Bihar
 ye maamla he san 2012 kaa
 a case was registered in the surveillance court of Muzaffarpur for investigating fake degree colleges
 jaanch kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya nigaraanee ke tatkaaleen espi parvej akhtar ko
 The report came in the year 2013
 nigaraanee vibhaag ne apni report main baccha raay ke sabhi chaar collejon ko clin chit de di gai, jabaki baaki ke collejon par exiaar darj ho gai
 Questions have been raised on this report of surveillance
 kaaran he ki baccha raay ke chaar collejon kii dharaatal par jo hakeekat he wo kuch or hi he jabaki report main in collejon ko maanak ke anuroop paaya gaya
 In this case, advocate Sudhir Ojha, who lodged a complaint in the monitoring court of Muzaffpur, said that he had complained to PK Thakur, SP of surveillance, who gave a clean chit to Bacha Rai's college, but no action was taken
 baccha raay ke chaar college rajdev raay degree college, kiratpur, rajaraam bhagavanpur, vaishali, rajdev raay lalamuni degree college, cheharakala, vaishali, siyavati lalamuni devi degree college patepur, vaishali or thakur devi ramachandra rajdev bauaaji raay degree college, sathiauta, lalganj, vaishali ko nigaraanee vibhaag ne niyam-kanoon ko taak par rakhkar clin chit di thi
 First of all, Rajdev Rai Lalmuni Degree College tells the reality of face art
 board par likhaa he is college main 31 vishyon kii padhai hoti he lekin sachai ye he ki is college ko abhi tak apana bhawan tak nahin he
 The roof of this college building is still being covered
 jaanch main khuli college kii polanigraanee vibhaag ne apni report main likhaa he ki is college main praachaarya kaksh, prayogshaala, pustkaalay, class rum ko lekar kul 15 kamare hai jabaki sachai kuch or hi he
 The reality is that the building of this college is being built so far
 nigaraanee vibhaag ne apni report main ye bhi likhaa tha ki is college ke paas kai acre jameen he jabaki haal hi main jab baba sahab bhimrao ambedkar uniwarsity ne isaki jaanch karai to jameen ke naam koi bhi kagajaat vishvavidhyalay ke paas nahin mili
 The same situation is with Bachha Rai's second degree college, Siawati Lalmuni Degree College Patepur, Vaishali
 is college ke report main bhi nigaraanee vibhaag ne khub kaside gadhe
 The report mentioned that the college has a well-equipped library, class room, laboratory, office and a total of 16 rooms of the principal, while the reality is completely different
 jab is college ke paas aaj kii taarikh main itane kamare nahin he or na hi wo sab he, jiskaa zikr report main kiya gaya
 In such a situation, when the watchdog gave its report in the year 2013, then from where would all this happen
 khapril ke makaan main chal rahaa colesub aapako baccha raay ke tisare college thakur devi ramachandra rajdev bauaaji raay degree college, sathiauta kii hakeekat bataate hai
 The reality of this college is that there are a total of four rooms in the house of the tile, while the report says that this college has 6 class rooms, 4 labs, one principal room, one office
 report main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki nae bhawan kaa nirmaan kaary bhi ho rahaa he jabaki dharaatal par aisa kuch nahin he
 The topper scam was started from this college, Rajdev Rai Degree College, the fourth degree college of Baba Rai, was also given a clean chit by the surveillance department, whereas the inter topper scam started from this college
 is tarah nigaraanee vibhaag ne baccha raay ke prabhaav main aakar uske vaise chaar degree collejon ko clin chit de di jo kahin se bhi manyata ke liye tay maanakon ko puraa nahin karte
