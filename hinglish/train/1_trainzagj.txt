agar aisa he to ek lekhak ke rup main meri yah pahchaan mere pehle upanyaas ‘kaala pahaad’ ne dilaai he
 However we should leave this 'good' to our readers
 kyonki yah zaruri nahin he ki jo kriti aapako pasand he, vahi ek pathak ko bhi ho
 In fact, it is a matter of textual discretion, taste and sensitivity
 aapkaa sabase pasandida lekhak? koun he or kyon?bhagavaandas morwal:main pasandida lekhak to nahin kahuunga, ve lekhak zarur bataa saktaa hum jinako padhakar mere bheetar ek lekhkeey vivek or bharosa paidaa hua
 Among them are Rahi Masoom Raza, Phaniswanath Renu, Srilal Shukla and Premchand
 visheshkar fanishwarnath renu jinka bahut se lekhakon kii tarah main bhi is rup main rini rahaa hum ki agar hindi main ‘mailaa anchal’ jaisi kriti nahin aati to na jane kitne andekhee, ansune anchal aaj hamaare sahitya ke hisse nahin ban pate
 Having read both these novels 'maila Aanchal' and 'adha Gaon', i had the courage to write Black Mountain
 bataur lekhak apane samakalinon main aap ko kiskaa lekhan pasand he?bhagavaandas morwal:har lekhak kaa apana dhang he
 Is his language
 uski style he
 Probably they work as hard as i write
 phir bhi mujhe un lekhakon kaa lekhan pasand he jinke lekhan main vyapak jivan drushti hoti he
 This life vision is enriched based on your experiences
 bhartiya samaaj kii itani paraten hai ki unhen samajhane main puraa jivan lag jaae
 Anyway, writing is not a career-making medium
 yah ek sadhana he jo nirantarata kii maang karata he
 What are you writing these days? Bhagwandas Morwal: As is well known, my sixth novel 'sur Banjaran' has come to the center of the Hathras style gimmick a year ago
 usase saans lene kii fursat mili he
 Well these days, i am engaged in collecting authentic material on Hasan Khan Mewati, the first Muslim Muslim warrior to fight the war against Babur, the first Mughal emperor or say
 pramanik isliye kah rahaa hum ki hasan khan mewati ko lekar hamaare yahaan bahut kuch miltaa nahin he
 While this Ranbankure fought a war against Babar and was martyred in the Battle of Khanwa, not with him despite being humbled and invited by Babur
 kya aap maanate hai ki hindi or bhartiya bhashaaon ke lekhakon ko unke hisse kaa sammaan or dhan praapt ho rahaa he?bhagavaandas morwal:mujhe nahin lagata ki hindi or bhartiya bhashaaon kaa koi lekhak kisi sammaan yaa aarthik laabh ke liye likhata hoga
 It was never a part of his thinking
 zyaadaatar lekhak hamaare yahaan purnakalik lekhak nahin hai or yah sambhav bhi nahin he, kyonki khaali lekhan se jeevanyaapan behad mushkil he
 Discussions of royalty received by well-known writers are often heard by us
 aise main ek lekhak ko lekhan se hone vaali kamai ke bare main baat karnaa, sirf man ko bahalane vaali baat he
 As such, the status of a writer today is less determined by his writing than his caste, his background, his kingdom, his region, and other reasons
 sthiti yah he ki hindi jaananevaala har doosraa vyakti aaj lekhak he aise main yah nishkarsh nikaalnaa behad dushkar he ki aap kise lekhak maanate hai
 What is the lesson for new writers? Bhagwandas Morwal: i have not yet been able to teach anyone a lesson
 main to khud hi seekhney kii prakriya se guzar rahaa hum

 It is also true that last year when Arvind Kejriwal reached the Delhi Secretariat with an oath and hundreds of cameras were behind him in the condition of disgrace

 Only accredited journalists or those who do not have recognition should be allowed to pass
 lekin sarkaar main asamanjas kii sthiti bani rahi
 When Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia came to the media room, some journalists shouted at him and asked questions on the entry ban of the media and he got up and left with decency

 Which was a nexus between bush-blair and power
 sarkaar ko janata ke prati hi jawaab deh rahanaa chahie
 As it is, the media is not known for any good work, perhaps it has become more infamous for brokerage, makkari and paid news

 Nagendra Sharma, you should ban such media
 lekin shaayad patrakarita mantriyon ke paas baithkar chaay pine, mobile number seve karaane, haath milakar dhanya hone yaa exclusive tik-take bhar kaa naam nahi he
 Yes, it is different that we see today's journalists more with these glasses

 Karisma and Sanjay's divorce case was in court with mutual consent of both and it was being described as the most expensive divorce case in Bollywood
 karishma ke vakil ne bataaya ki jin financial kamitments ke aadhaar par aapasi sahmati se talaak kii yachika court main daayar kii gai thi, sanjay ne unako puraa nahin kiya
 For this reason, Karisma has withdrawn the earlier appeal of consent by filing a new petition
 cese main aarope-pratyarope kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he kyonki sanjay ke vakil ne bhi aapasi sahmati kii apil waapas lene kii baat kahi he
 Please tell that Karisma and Sanjay Kapoor were married in the year 2003 and they also have two children

 You will not forget Yuvraj Singh, neither you nor his father Yograj Singh's statement in which he gave responsibility to captain Dhoni for not selecting Yuvi for the World Cup team
 to masalaa ye he ki dhoni ne bahut dinon baad yuvi par apni jubaan kholi he
 The captain of the team which has been invincible so far in the World Cup has said that the new rules of fielding snatched a bowler like Yuvraj Singh
 gauratlab he ki 2011 main bharat main khele gaye world cap main yuvaraj singh main of da siries rahe the or balle se khub ran batore the
 However, after four years, captain Dhoni feels that a new bowler like Yuvi is no longer effective due to the new rules
 duusari ore ashanka is baat kii bhi he ki dhoni ke is bayaan par vivaadon kaa daur naa shuru ho jaae
 Dhoni said in response to a question that due to the new fielding rules (only four fielders outside the 30-yard circle), India had to lose a useful bowler like Yuvraj Singh
 dhoni is sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the ki kya suresh raina 2015 main yuvi kii nibhaa sakate hai, jo 2011 world cap main khabbu ballebaaj yuvi ne nibhaai thi
 The captain of Team India said, 'you must have seen that Yuvi did not bowl much after the change in rules
 ham yah sweekaar karte hai ki niyamon main badlaav ke baad unki gendbaaji prabhavit hui, haalanki tii20 main vah niyamit gendbaaj hai
 Dhoni has never been a supporter of the rule of keeping four fielders out of the 30-yard circle, as he believed that many of his part-time bowlers such as Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag were no more effective in the changed conditions
 unhone kaha, 'jab tak fielding kaa yah niyam nahin tha tab tak viru paaji, sachin paaji or yuvi ko gendbaaji saunpi jaati thi or ham un par nirbhar the, lekin ve sabhi part time gendbaaj the or ballebaaji ke liye anukool wicket par unke liye gendbaaji karnaa mushkil hota
 "dhoni said," Similarly, if the wicket helps some, Raina is a good choice
 vah baayen haath ke ballebaajon ke liye acchhee line se gendbaaji karte hai

 Both lungs also almost stopped functioning after liver failure, but due to the miracle of medical science, not only did she get a new life but saved a family from being devastated
 docktaron kaa ye bhi daawa he ki desh main ye apni tarah kaa pehla maamla he
 The mother gave the lever part to give new life to the new periphery, not only the team of doctors has done wonders, but her mother herself has given birth to it in a way by giving 20 percent of her liver

 aapako bataa den ki 5 saal kii paridhi ko janm se hi ek beemaari thi
 There was no gallbladder in his body
 iske kaaran pit liver main jamaa hota gaya or liver me infections hone ke kaaran wo fail ho gaya
 One was battling many diseases, saving the life of the family was a big challenge for the doctors because he had not one but many problems
 liver kharaab hone ke kaaran sara infections langs tak pahunch gaya
 His tubes widened, causing dirty blood to enter the body without getting oxygen
 sharir main oxigen kii bhayankar kami ho gai
 Apart from this, there were many challenges that doctors had to face
 paridhi ke dimag me ek sist bhi tha
 Already the heart's tubes had widened, the langs were unable to clean the blood, and about 50 percent of the dirty blood had reached the body without getting oxygen
 kam tha vajan, haddiyaan bhi ho gai thi kamjorapako bataa den ki itani sari complications ke chalate ye nanhee pari na to chal paati thi, na apane doston se baat kar paati thi kyonki use lagaataar chakkar aate rahete the
 The situation was that at the age of five years, where the weight of the child should have been 24-25 kg, the circumference weight was only around 15 kg and was completely weak
 nakhun nile or haath paanv chaude ho gaye the or haddiyaan bhi kamjor ho gai thi
 Doctors carried out the operation with complete caution
 Amidst all this, a team of about 32 doctors took care while performing the operation and gave a new life to this girl
 sable pehle uskaa beepi down na ho iskaa dhayaan rakhaa, zero blad surgery kii, special tareeke kii mashin istemaal kii
 100% oxygen support
 kahi bhi zaraa si chook nahin hone di or oparation safal rahaa
 Even after the operation of the perimeter, the challenge of the Doktor was not over
 nayaa liver laga tha or use oxigen kii puri jarurat thi, isliye paridhi ko puure ek maheene tak vantilator par rakhaa gaya
 But overall the perimeter is fine now

 aapako yahaan keval 1 din bydaree milegi
 When used more, this time can also decrease
 aap chahen to power sever on kar sakate hai lekin iske baad aap watch par keval time hi dekh paaenge
 Initially the battery condition was worse, but after a few updates the situation was corrected
 bydaree ke positive point ek ye he ki isamen fast charging diya gaya he jo vaaki kamaal kaa he
 On the rest of the wear OS you can see the timing and use of the battery
 bydaree ko hamane niraashajanak isliye bhi kaha kyonki huaave ne haal hi main isse bhi kam keemat main ho hafte tak kii bydaree vaala smartwatch utaara he
 In such a situation, where the rest of the companies are giving two weeks of battery, it is very disappointing to have only one day or less battery
 faisla:ab sawaal ye he ki kya aap ise khariden? agar aap waterpruf smartwatch chaahate hai jo aapke fitness trekking ke liye bhi kaam aae or jo kaaphi stylish ho to aap ise kharid sakate hai
 But if you want more powerful performance and top class battery backup than a stylish look, then i will not refund you

 There has been anger against Pakistan in the country since the Pulwama terror attack
 maang uth rahi he ki bharat ko is saal hone vaale cricket world cap main pakistan ke khilaaf nahin khelnaa chahie, phir chaahe use toornament se hatana hi kyon naa pade
 But Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted on Friday that if it happens, it will be worse than surrender
 shashi tharur ne likhaa ki 1999 main kargil kii ladaai ke dauraan bharat ne world cap main pakistan ke khilaaf match khelaa tha
 Then we also threw him
 agar ham world cap main uske khilaaf nahin khelte hai to naa sirf hamen do points kaa ghaataa hoga, balki ye sarender se bhi badtar hoga
 Because it will be a lost defeat without fighting
 Reminder: at the height of the 1999 Kargil War, India played Pakistan in the cricket World Cup, & won
 To forfeit the match this year would not just cost two points: it would be worse than surrender, since it would be defeat without a fight

 Arjun Kapoor has been very close to his mother
 saal 2012 main cancer se unka nidhan ho gaya tha
 Arjun wrote a Poem for his mother when he was 12 years old
 achaanak arjuna ko maa ke liye haathon se likhi gai kavita mil gai
 Arjun has shared this poem with fans on social media with an emotional note
 yahi nahin iske saath unhone maa sang khinchaai gai bachapan kii tasviren bhi share kii hai
 Sharing the post, Arjun wrote - This Poem was my hand, which i wrote for my mother at the age of 12
 ye ek bachche ke rup main meraa sabase shuddh swaroop tha
 During this time, i felt a love and affection for him and through this poem i tried to show it
 main unase behad pyaar karata hum or unhen har subah miss karata hum
 Now i have no other option but to accept that i cannot love them anymore
 View this post on instagramfound this handwritten poem of mine pardon the handwriting though
 
 
 i wrote this for Mom when i was 12 years old
 It’s maybe my most purest moment as a child where i felt loved & wanted to thank her for the love she gave me
 i miss her love, I'm vulnerable every morning without it
 i didn’t have a choice but to accept that i wouldn’t have her Love anymore
 
 
 on most days it feels unfair & it bothers me, it consumes me i feel lost & helpless
 
 
 
 I'm just writing this as a son & nothing more
 i wish i could hear her call me Beta one more time
 
 
 i miss her all the Fucking time & it makes everything seem irrelevant more often than not
 
 
 i broke 8 years back
 
 
 now i wake up trying to fix myself every morning smile at life but honestly that vacuum shall never cease to exist
 i don’t know why I’m venting but i guess life takes a toll on us because we are human & i confess i am no hero, i am no different it takes a toll on me too
 
 
 Miss you Mom hope ur happy wherever you are
 
 
 Love You the mostest
 
 
 a post shared byarjun Kapoor (@arjunkapoor) onnov 22, 2019 at 4:15 am PST Arjun said that whenever i think about it i get distracted
 main ye ek betaa hone ke naate likh rahaa hum
 i wish she would call me son once more and i could hear that
 main unhen har samay miss karata hum
 i broke up 8 years ago
 main hameshaa ye koshish karata hum ki main har nai subah kii shuruyaat ek muskaraahat ke saath karun magar maa ke jane kaa jo abhaav he wo dur nahin ho rahaa he
 Perhaps life wants to tell that in reality i am not a hero, so he tries me again and again
 maa, main ummid karata hum ki aap jahaan bhi hongi khush hongi
 i love you the most bachapan kii tasviren bhi kii shairpost ke saath arjuna ne do tasviir bhi lagaai hai jisamen ve behad chote hai or maa kii god main hai

 After the crushing defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, the three-tier change strategy by Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is beginning to show

 1
 har baat par modi or bijepi virodh band kiya jaae
 The role of the party should convey to the public that the Congress is in the role of a positive opposition
 2
 Soon the organization should be changed and fixed
 apni baton ko majbootee se neeche tak pahunchaaya jaae
 3

 This rift, however, was later resolved
 magar jab modi mukhyamantri bane tab yah saaf ho gaya ki unki hukumat main togdipha or vihip ko haashie par rakhaa jayega
 This triggered a bit of bitterness in Togadia's mind and his psyche with Modi increased

 They met on the roadside unconscious and were hospitalized

 But Togadia threatened to create a separate faction

 In the past few days, there have been many statements about the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board running late
 ham un bayanon ke zarie samiksha karenge ki kaaran kya he, sawaal kya he or sabake jawaab kya hai
 Is everyone talking or are they saying the right thing
 30 may ko railway board ke chairman ashvini lohani ne apane fasebuk par ek coment kiya he
 Perhaps this will be their answer in the context of questions arising about late trains
 ve likhte hai ki 'media aksar uttar se purv sector main chalane vaali trainon ke let hone kaa maamla uthaata rahata he
 Our focus is on security operations and infrastructure such as Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation and ending level crossings
 haal ke dinon main trainon kii reporting main satyata bhi ai he jiske kaaran trainon ke samay kaa aankada bahut karaab dikhne laga he
 Due to the correct reporting of the time, 12 to 15 percent more is visible
 jabaki tathy yah he ki buniyadi dhaanche ke vistaar ke bagair bina soche samajhe nai gaadiyaan chalaai jaati rahi hai
 We also have to understand the problem that has arisen due to decades of neglect, which cannot be overcome so easily
 donon taraf se keemat chukaani padegi
 ' ab inke bayaan ke do hisse hai
 One is to ignore the infrastructure and launch new trains randomly and the other part is that the reporting of late running of trains is now correcting, so 12 to 15 percent more is visible in the data
 data main nahin bhi dikhataa to bhi trainen let to chali hi rahi thim or chal hi rahi hai
 We talk about the second part
 kya vaaki truthfull reporting ho rahi he
 We cannot challenge directly but we have a case study
 ham chaahate hai ki ashvini lohani apana record book thik se check karen
 On May 31, a passenger from Bihar's Saharsa railway station receives a call that the National Train Encouragement System (NETS) is showing that 13026 Janhit Express has reached Saharsa but i am at the station and the train has not come on the platform
 website par dikhaa rahaa he ki train 3 baj kar 15 minute par saharsa stesan pahunch chuki he
 With a delay of 25 minutes
 us yatri se baat karte karte sava chaar ho gaye the magar train nahin ai thi
 Our colleague Kanhaiya ran to the station and sends us a screen shot of the arrival time of the train registered in the station register
 janhit express danapur se saharsa jaati he
 You can clearly see that it is written that the train has reached the destination
 angrezi main likhaa he ki reached destination, samay diya he sava teen kaa
 With a delay of 25 minutes
 iske pahunchane kaa sahi samay he 2 bajkar 50 minute
 The screen shot shows that the register has been recorded by hand
 tisare number par aap dekh rahe hai janhit express kaa number 13206
 It clearly states that the train has arrived at 4
35 am
 aapane abhi-abhi dekha ki website par train ek ghanta let pahunchi he jabaki hakeekat main train ek ghanta baad pahunchati he
 Ashwani Lohani Chairman Railway Board was visiting Gorakhupar Mandal on 1 June where our colleague says in response to a general question of Salim that we enter the same time when the train reaches the website
 ham ek udhaaharan ke dam par chairman lohani ke is bayaan ko chunauti to nahin denge kyonki wo bachakaana ho jaataa he magar unhen zarur bataanaa chahenge ki saharsa pahunchane vaali janhit express kaa data koun farji tareeke se bhar rahaa tha ye wo pataa karen
 How is it possible that the train appears in the website at three and a quarter to three o'clock and the station register is recorded at four and a quarter
 ab aate hai unke fasebuk post ke pehle hisse par ki buniyadi dhaanche kaa vistaar nahin hua, matlab line nahin bichhin, unka navinikaran nahin hua or rail maarg kaa doharikaran nahin hua
 This is the legacy of previous governments
 agar ye sab nahin hua to phir rail mantri 29 may ko soshal media kii ek site kwora par kyon likhte hai ki modi sarkaar ke chaar saal ke dauraan 407 railgadiyaan chalaai gayi taaki yatriyon ko suvidha ho or punchuatlity yani samay main sudhaar ho
 When the capacity of the track has been utilized to the maximum, why more than 100 trains were launched every year during the Modi government
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki rail mantri kah rahe hai ki 407 trainen isliye launch kii gayi taaki puchuality main sudhaar ho
 Then the Minister should also tell that in four years 400 trains have been launched for political reasons or for practical reasons
 jabaki kai jagahon par rail mantri or rail board ke chayaraman kehete hai ki trek kshamta kii parvaah kiye bagair pichhali sarkaron ne gaadiyaan launch kar deen jiske kaaran let ho rahi hai
 Don't you feel weird '65 saal se mumbai-chennai ke bich single trek he
 Load is 180 percent more on North East trains
 ham thik kar rahe hai
 The Railway Minister has tweeted this statement himself
 yahaan kaaran saaf he ki trek kii navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan bada kaaran he
 Will also
 lekin hamen itane bayanon main kahin nahin mila ki is root main itane kimi par kaam chal rahaa he, itane dinon se chal rahaa he or isaki tazaa sthiti ye he
 Now let's talk about the news
 30 may 2018 kii pitiai kii khabar he ki rail mantralay ne do dinon kii kaaryshaala yojit kii he jisamen sabhi bade adhikari shaamil hue hai
 Mission speed is mentioned in this news
 pataa chalaa ki teen saal se mishan raftaar chal rahaa he phir iskaa rigelt uttar bharat kii taraf kharaab kyon he
 PTI reports that under the mission speed, in the next five years, the average speed of passenger car and goods train will be increased to 25 km per hour
 is vakt yatri gaadi kii ausat raftaar 44 kimi prati ghanta he or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar 25 kimi prati ghanta he
 According to an old news on internet, Mamata Banerjee launched Vision 2020 in 2010 as Railway Minister
 chaar bullate train chalaane kii baat thi usamen or baaki gadiyon kii ausat raftaar 160-200 kimi prati ghante kiye jane kaa lakshya tha
 But Piyush Goyal wants to reach an average speed of 69 kmph in five years
 agar mere samajhane main koi chook nahin hui he to wo vijan 2020 kahaan gaya jise ek railmantri ne janata ke paise lagaakar taiyaar kiya tha or uskaa states kya he
 On Sunday and Monday, you must have seen on many newspapers and channels that the Railway Minister has fixed the accountability of the officials of all the 16 zones of the railway
 kai log mujhe badhai dene lage ki rail siries kaa asar ho rahaa he
 While similar news has been published in the name of Lohani Sahab that he has asked the zonal officials to improve the time
 us aadesh kaa kya riselt niklaa, wo bataanaa chahie tha
 At that time, after listening to the Railway Minister, he felt that he had not heard it before
 pitiai ke hawaale se khabar ai he ki rail mantri ne sabhi zone pramukhon ko chetavanee di he ki agar ek maheene main trainon ke let chalane main sudhaar nahin hua he to unke pramotion ke dauraan moolyankan par asar padegaa
 While you heard the Railway Minister and Chairman Railway Board many times that the track capacity has not improved since 65 years, so trains are running late, will these zonal officers fix the problem of 65 years in a month
 rail mantri ko saaf kahana chahie ki samasya kahaan hai
 Is in track capacity or in the efficiency of the officers
 yaa samasya unke tarah tarah ke bayanon or faislon main he
 If the officials in Lethalifi can improve in a month for fear of stopping the promotion, then this work should have been done earlier so that many people are not harmed
 kya railmantri pehali baar jaage hai, pehali baar adhikariyon ko nirdesh de rahe hai, aisa bilkul nahin he
 He is well aware that on his Twitter handle, a large number of passengers complain of being late
 6 november 2017 ve apurva kumaar ke jawaab main likhte hai ki 'shukriya
 The government has made a lot of efforts to increase the timeliness of trains
 jinamein kshamta vistaar project or samay sarini kaa revizan bhi he
 'on 7 March 2018, tweet that' earlier there was a railway mentality that we are short of funds, then delay everything
 ab maansikta he ki har chiz ko aage badhaao or tezi se karo kyonki hamaare paas paryaapt fund he
 'on 7 March, tweeting that' the practice of recording manual punctuality in the Indian Railways was dropped from 41 major stations of all zones to increase the timeliness of trains and to inform the train status of the train at the right time
 Could
 ' 10 march ko rail mantri financial express kii story ko twit karte hai ki gudbai tu let trains yani trainon kaa let hone ko ab gudbai kah dijie
 Indian Railways has adopted these ten methods to ensure timeliness
 ' The story of the Financial Express that the Minister tweeted was that the Railway Minister wants the Indian Railways to be like the railroad of Switzerland where the watches are mixed from the time the train arrives
 ab main aapako yahaan ek tathy bataata hum, rail mantri ko to pataa hi hoga
 On 14 March, in the Parliament, the Ministry of Railways has responded that it is the policy of the railways that a vehicle reaching 15 minutes late is considered on time
 matlab 15 minute let ko aadhikarik rup se rhite time maanata he rail mantralay
 March tweets and his speeches from November show that it is in his mind to keep going late, but only he can tell what improved during this time
 unke pehle ke nirdeshon kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 On 14 March, the Minister of State for Railways has the answer in the Lok Sabha that 451 trains arrive late in the current financial year
 to phir us dauraan mantri ji ne kya ection liya, pramotion roak denge jaise hedline vaale bayaan se pehle ke unke bayanon kaa kya riselt niklaa
 We had shown in the rail series that patna-kota never lasts less than 20-25 hours
 ab usamen sudhaar aa gaya he
 But in the same Northern Railway between 10 April 2017 to 10 March 2018, 1341 Rajdhani Express arrived, 632 Duronto, 1425 Shatabdi late
 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he
 The latency rate this year is 49
 59 pratishat he yani 50 pratishat trainen let chalati hai jabaki pichley saal 31
 74 percent trains were late
 ek saal main itani vruddhi kaise ho gai, rail mantri hi bataa sakate hai, kya koi nayaa project launch ho gaya, wo project kahaan launch hua he
 If the track is the reason, can the general manager of Northern Railway really improve the running time of the vehicles within a month
 unka beepi hai ho rahaa hoga, ham samajhate hai
 There is a report of Prabhat Khabar on 20 April 2018
 raksol se narkatiyaganj ke bich 42 kimi line par navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan yani meter gej se broad gej karne kii yojana abhi tak adhuri he jabaki yah 1 april 2014 ko launch hui thi
 The 42 km line has not been built in five years
 lambii duuri ke liye is root ke logon ke liye train hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has written on Kaura that '6 every day during the Modi government
 5 kimi ke hisaab linon ke navinikaran, doharikaran or parivartan ke project launch hote hai
 'accordingly, 981 between 1 January and 31 May this year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch hue honge
 Accordingly, 2372 in the whole year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch honge
 Do you know that in the 2018-19 budget, the target is to double the 18,000 km line
 is hisaab se 18000 kimi ke saamne 2375 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa project kuch bhi nahin he
 There are plenty of statements but no evidence is found
 agar aap sunen ki upie ke samay 4
 5 km per day rail line project was launched and now 6
 5 kimi prati din launch ho rahaa he to jaldi prabhavit ho jaaenge magar yah to rail ke apane hi lakshya se bahut kam he
 In this way, if we review the statements of the Railway Minister, then the situation seems alarming
 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae
 We do not know what happened to that report and the target, whereas it would have cost the public money and time to make it
 kya 2018-19 main 18000 kimi trek kaa doharikaran, navinikaran or parivartan ho saktaa he? It is okay to have a big goal, but it should be true
 2014 se 2018 ke bich railway kul milakar 18000 kimi trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin kar pai to ek saal main kaise kar legi
 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani also said that there was to be maintenance on the Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines, but it did not work
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time
 lagata he dinemic mantri ji prime time dekhne lage hai
 It is not about reasons, it is about focus
 agar is series se focus banataa he to phir thik he
 Now his statement has two parts
 ek buniyadi dhaanche kii andekhi or bina soche samajhe nai trainon ko laanch karnaa or doosraa hissaa he ki trainon ke let chalane kii reporting ab sahi ho rahi he isliye data main 12 se 15 pratishat adhik dikhne laga he
 Even if not visible in the data, the trains were late and still running
 ham duusare hisse kii baat karte hai
 Is truthfull reporting really happening? ham sidhe chalange nahin kar sakate magar hamaare paas ek cese study he
 We want Ashwani Lohani to check her record book properly
 31 may ko bihar ke saharsa railway stesan se ek yatri kaa phone aata he ki neshnal train ankavyari system (NETS) main dikhaa rahaa he ki 13026 janhit express saharsa pahunch gai he lekin main stesan par hum or train platform par nahin ai he
 It is showing on the website that the train has reached Saharsa station at 3
15 am
 25 minute kii deree se
 While talking to that passenger it was a quarter past four but the train did not come
 hamaare sahyogi kanhaiya bhaag kar stesan gaye or stesan ke register main darj train ke pahunchane ke samay kaa screen shot lekar hamen bhej dete hai
 Janhit Express goes from Danapur to Saharsa
 aap saaf-saaf dekh sakate hai ki isamen likhaa he ki train gantavy par pahunch gai he
 It is written in English that reached destination, time is given by a quarter to three
 25 minute kii deree se
 The correct time to reach it is 2:50 AM
 screen shot main dikhataa he ki register main haath se darj kiya gaya he
 You are seeing number 13206 of Janhit Express at number three
 isamen saaf likhaa he ki train 4 bajkar 35 minute par pahunchi he
 You have just seen that on the website the train has reached one hour late whereas in reality the train reaches after one hour
 ashvini lohani chairman railway board 1 june ko gorkhupar mandal ke daure par the jahaan hamaare sahyogi saleem ke ek general sawaal ke jawaab main kehete hai ki train jis samay pahunchati he ham vahi darj karte hai website main
 We will not challenge Chairman Lohani's statement as an example because it is childish but would like to tell him who was filling the data of the public interest express reaching Saharsa in a fake way
 kaise mumkin hua ki website main train dopaher sava teen baje pahunchati dikhti he or stesan ke register main sava chaar baje pahunchnaa darj he
 Now it comes to the first part of his Facebook post that the infrastructure was not expanded, meaning lines were not laid, they were not renewed and the railroad was not doubled
 pichhali sarkaron kii yah viraasat he
 If all this does not happen, then why does the Railway Minister write on Kaura, a social media site on May 29, that 407 trains were run during the four years of the Modi government to facilitate the passengers and improve the punchuatlity
 jab trek kii kshamta kaa adhiktam istamaal ho chukaa he to modi sarkaar ke daur main har saal 100 se adhik trainen kyon launch kii gayi
 You must have noticed that the Railway Minister is saying that 407 trains were launched so that puchuality is improved
 phir mantri ji ye bhi bataa den ki chaar saal main 400 train raajnneetik kaarnon se launch hui hai yaa vyaavhaarik kaarnon se
 Whereas in many places, the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board say that the previous governments have launched trains irrespective of the track capacity, which is causing the delay
 kya aapako ajeeb nahin lagata he
 '65 is a single track between Mumbai and Chennai
 uttar purv gadiyon par 180 pratishat zyada he lod
 We are doing fine ' rail mantri ne apana yah bayaan khud hi twit kiya he
 The reason here is clear that the renewal, doubling and gauge conversion of the track is a big reason
 hoga bhi
 But we could not find anywhere in such statements that work is going on so many km in this route, it has been running for so many days and its current status is this
 ab do khabaron kii baat karte hai
 PTI reported on 30 May 2018 that the Railway Ministry has organized a two-day workshop in which all the top officials have attended
 is news main mishan raftaar kaa zikr he
 It was found out that the mission has been going on for three years, then why its result is bad towards North India
 pitiai kii khabar main he ki mishan raftaar ke tahat agle paanch saal main yatri gaadi or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar main 25 kimi prati ghante kaa izaafaa kiya jayega
 The average speed of a passenger train is 44 km per hour and the average speed of a goods train is 25 km per hour
 internet par mili ek puraani khabar ke anusaar 2010 main rail mantri ke taur par mamata banerjee ne vijan 2020 launch kiya tha
 There was talk of running four bullet trains and the target was to increase the average speed of the remaining trains to 160-200 kmph
 magar piyush goyal to paanch saal main ausat raftaar 69 kimi prati ghante karnaa chaahate hai
 If there is no mistake in my understanding, then where did the vision 2020 that a railway minister had prepared by putting public money and what is his status
 ravivaar or somvaar ko aapane kai samachar patron or channelon par dekha hoga ki rail mantri ne railway ke sabhi 16 zone ke adhikariyon kii javabdehi tay kii he
 Many people started congratulating me that the rail series is taking effect
 jabaki isi tarah kii khabar lohani sahab ke naam se chap chuki he ki unhone zonal adhikariyon se kaha he ki samay main sudhaar karen
 What was the result of that order, they should have told
 tabhi rail mantri kii baat sunakar laga ki kahin pehle to nahin suna he
 The PTI was quoted as saying that the Railway Minister has warned all zone heads that if trains have not improved in a month, the evaluation will be affected during their promotion
 jabaki aapane rail mantri or chairman railway board ko kai baar kehete suna ki 65 saal se trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin hua isliye trainen let chal rahi hai to kya 65 saal kii samasya ye zonal adhikari ek maheene main thik kar denge
 The railway minister should clearly state where the problems lie
 trek kii kshamta main he yaa adhikariyon kii kaarykushalta main he
 Or the problem lies in their various statements and decisions
 agar letlatifi main adhikari pramotion rukne ke dar se ek maheene main sudhaar laa sakate hai to vaaki ye kaam pehle kiya janaa chahie tha taaki kai logon ko nuksaan nahin hota
 Is the Railway Minister awake for the first time, giving instructions to officers for the first time, is not so at all
 unhen thik se pataa he ki unke twitor handle par rose badi sankhya main yatri let hone kii shikaayat karte hai
 6 November 2017 He writes in response to Apoorva Kumar that 'thank you
 trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne bahut saare prayaas kiye hai
 Including revision of capacity expansion project and time table
 ' 7 march 2018 ko twit karte hai ki 'pehle railway kii maansikta thi ki hamaare paas fund kii kami he to sab kuch deree kar do
 Now the mindset is to pursue everything and do it fast because we have enough funds
 ' 7 march ko twit karte hai ki 'bhartiya rail main haath se samaybaddhata ko ricard karne kaa abhyaas sabhi zonon ke 41 bade steshnon se hataa diya gaya taaki trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaai ja sake or sawari ko sahi samay main train kii sthiti kii jaankaree di ja sake
 On March 10, the Railway Minister tweets the story of Financial Express that Goodbye to Late trains means that trains are late and now say Goodbye
 bhartiya railway ne samaybaddhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye ye das tareeke apanaae hai
 ' financial express kii jis story ko mantri ne twit kiya tha ki wo yah thi ki rail mantri chaahate hai ki bhartiya rail sweetsraland ke rail kii tarah honi chahie jahaan ghadiyaan train ke pahunchane ke time se milaai jaati hai
 Now let me tell you a fact here, the Railway Minister would know
 isi 14 march ko sansad main rail mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki rail kii niti he ki 15 minute kii deree tak pahunchane vaali gaadi ko samay par mana jaataa he
 That is, the Ministry of Railways officially considers 15 minutes late as Right Time
 nanvabar se march ke twit or unke bhaashan bataate hai ki let chalane kii baat unke dimag main he magar vahi bataa sakate hai ki is dauraan kya sudhaar hua
 What was the result of his earlier instructions
 14 march ko rail rajya mantri kaa hi jawaab he loksabhaa main ki maujuuda vitt varsh main har din 451 gaadiyaan deree se pahunchati hai
 Then what action did the minister take during that time, will stop the promotion like what was the result of his statements before the headline statement
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he
 Accordingly, there is nothing to improve the capacity of 2375 km lines in front of 18000 km
 bayaan to khub milte hai magar pramaan nahin milte hai
 If you hear that at the time of UPA 4
 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 31 may ko bihar ke saharsa railway stesan se ek yatri kaa phone aata he ki neshnal train ankavyari system (NETS) main dikhaa rahaa he ki 13026 janhit express saharsa pahunch gai he lekin main stesan par hum or train platform par nahin ai he
 It is showing on the website that the train has reached Saharsa station at 3
15 am
 25 minute kii deree se

 But we could not find anywhere in such statements that work is going on so many km in this route, it has been running for so many days and its current status is this
 ab do khabaron kii baat karte hai
 PTI reported on 30 May 2018 that the Railway Ministry has organized a two-day workshop in which all the top officials have attended
 is news main mishan raftaar kaa zikr he
 It was found out that the mission has been going on for three years, then why its result is bad towards North India
 pitiai kii khabar main he ki mishan raftaar ke tahat agle paanch saal main yatri gaadi or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar main 25 kimi prati ghante kaa izaafaa kiya jayega
 The average speed of a passenger train is 44 km per hour and the average speed of a goods train is 25 km per hour
 internet par mili ek puraani khabar ke anusaar 2010 main rail mantri ke taur par mamata banerjee ne vijan 2020 launch kiya tha
 There was talk of running four bullet trains and the target was to increase the average speed of the remaining trains to 160-200 kmph
 magar piyush goyal to paanch saal main ausat raftaar 69 kimi prati ghante karnaa chaahate hai
 If there is no mistake in my understanding, then where did the vision 2020 that a railway minister had prepared by putting public money and what is his status
 ravivaar or somvaar ko aapane kai samachar patron or channelon par dekha hoga ki rail mantri ne railway ke sabhi 16 zone ke adhikariyon kii javabdehi tay kii he
 Many people started congratulating me that the rail series is taking effect
 jabaki isi tarah kii khabar lohani sahab ke naam se chap chuki he ki unhone zonal adhikariyon se kaha he ki samay main sudhaar karen
 What was the result of that order, they should have told
 tabhi rail mantri kii baat sunakar laga ki kahin pehle to nahin suna he
 The PTI was quoted as saying that the Railway Minister has warned all zone heads that if trains have not improved in a month, the evaluation will be affected during their promotion
 jabaki aapane rail mantri or chairman railway board ko kai baar kehete suna ki 65 saal se trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin hua isliye trainen let chal rahi hai to kya 65 saal kii samasya ye zonal adhikari ek maheene main thik kar denge
 The railway minister should clearly state where the problems lie
 trek kii kshamta main he yaa adhikariyon kii kaarykushalta main he
 Or the problem lies in their various statements and decisions
 agar letlatifi main adhikari pramotion rukne ke dar se ek maheene main sudhaar laa sakate hai to vaaki ye kaam pehle kiya janaa chahie tha taaki kai logon ko nuksaan nahin hota
 Is the Railway Minister awake for the first time, giving instructions to officers for the first time, is not so at all
 unhen thik se pataa he ki unke twitor handle par rose badi sankhya main yatri let hone kii shikaayat karte hai
 6 November 2017 He writes in response to Apoorva Kumar that 'thank you
 trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne bahut saare prayaas kiye hai
 Including revision of capacity expansion project and time table
 ' 7 march 2018 ko twit karte hai ki 'pehle railway kii maansikta thi ki hamaare paas fund kii kami he to sab kuch deree kar do
 Now the mindset is to pursue everything and do it fast because we have enough funds
 ' 7 march ko twit karte hai ki 'bhartiya rail main haath se samaybaddhata ko ricard karne kaa abhyaas sabhi zonon ke 41 bade steshnon se hataa diya gaya taaki trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaai ja sake or sawari ko sahi samay main train kii sthiti kii jaankaree di ja sake
 On March 10, the Railway Minister tweets the story of Financial Express that Goodbye to Late trains means that trains are late and now say Goodbye
 bhartiya railway ne samaybaddhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye ye das tareeke apanaae hai
 ' financial express kii jis story ko mantri ne twit kiya tha ki wo yah thi ki rail mantri chaahate hai ki bhartiya rail sweetsraland ke rail kii tarah honi chahie jahaan ghadiyaan train ke pahunchane ke time se milaai jaati hai
 Now let me tell you a fact here, the Railway Minister would know
 isi 14 march ko sansad main rail mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki rail kii niti he ki 15 minute kii deree tak pahunchane vaali gaadi ko samay par mana jaataa he
 That is, the Ministry of Railways officially considers 15 minutes late as Right Time
 nanvabar se march ke twit or unke bhaashan bataate hai ki let chalane kii baat unke dimag main he magar vahi bataa sakate hai ki is dauraan kya sudhaar hua
 What was the result of his earlier instructions
 14 march ko rail rajya mantri kaa hi jawaab he loksabhaa main ki maujuuda vitt varsh main har din 451 gaadiyaan deree se pahunchati hai
 Then what action did the minister take during that time, will stop the promotion like what was the result of his statements before the headline statement
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he
 Accordingly, there is nothing to improve the capacity of 2375 km lines in front of 18000 km
 bayaan to khub milte hai magar pramaan nahin milte hai
 If you hear that at the time of UPA 4
 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 ham ek udhaaharan ke dam par chairman lohani ke is bayaan ko chunauti to nahin denge kyonki wo bachakaana ho jaataa he magar unhen zarur bataanaa chahenge ki saharsa pahunchane vaali janhit express kaa data koun farji tareeke se bhar rahaa tha ye wo pataa karen
 How is it possible that the train appears in the website at three and a quarter to three o'clock and the station register is recorded at four and a quarter
 ab aate hai unke fasebuk post ke pehle hisse par ki buniyadi dhaanche kaa vistaar nahin hua, matlab line nahin bichhin, unka navinikaran nahin hua or rail maarg kaa doharikaran nahin hua
 This is the legacy of previous governments
 agar ye sab nahin hua to phir rail mantri 29 may ko soshal media kii ek site kwora par kyon likhte hai ki modi sarkaar ke chaar saal ke dauraan 407 railgadiyaan chalaai gayi taaki yatriyon ko suvidha ho or punchuatlity yani samay main sudhaar ho
 When the capacity of the track has been utilized to the maximum, why more than 100 trains were launched every year during the Modi government
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki rail mantri kah rahe hai ki 407 trainen isliye launch kii gayi taaki puchuality main sudhaar ho
 Then the Minister should also tell that in four years 400 trains have been launched for political reasons or for practical reasons
 jabaki kai jagahon par rail mantri or rail board ke chayaraman kehete hai ki trek kshamta kii parvaah kiye bagair pichhali sarkaron ne gaadiyaan launch kar deen jiske kaaran let ho rahi hai
 Don't you feel weird '65 saal se mumbai-chennai ke bich single trek he
 Load is 180 percent more on North East trains
 ham thik kar rahe hai
 The Railway Minister has tweeted this statement himself
 yahaan kaaran saaf he ki trek kii navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan bada kaaran he
 Will also
 lekin hamen itane bayanon main kahin nahin mila ki is root main itane kimi par kaam chal rahaa he, itane dinon se chal rahaa he or isaki tazaa sthiti ye he
 Now let's talk about the news
 30 may 2018 kii pitiai kii khabar he ki rail mantralay ne do dinon kii kaaryshaala yojit kii he jisamen sabhi bade adhikari shaamil hue hai
 Mission speed is mentioned in this news
 pataa chalaa ki teen saal se mishan raftaar chal rahaa he phir iskaa rigelt uttar bharat kii taraf kharaab kyon he
 PTI reports that under the mission speed, in the next five years, the average speed of passenger car and goods train will be increased to 25 km per hour
 is vakt yatri gaadi kii ausat raftaar 44 kimi prati ghanta he or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar 25 kimi prati ghanta he
 According to an old news on internet, Mamata Banerjee launched Vision 2020 in 2010 as Railway Minister
 chaar bullate train chalaane kii baat thi usamen or baaki gadiyon kii ausat raftaar 160-200 kimi prati ghante kiye jane kaa lakshya tha
 But Piyush Goyal wants to reach an average speed of 69 kmph in five years
 agar mere samajhane main koi chook nahin hui he to wo vijan 2020 kahaan gaya jise ek railmantri ne janata ke paise lagaakar taiyaar kiya tha or uskaa states kya he
 On Sunday and Monday, you must have seen on many newspapers and channels that the Railway Minister has fixed the accountability of the officials of all the 16 zones of the railway
 kai log mujhe badhai dene lage ki rail siries kaa asar ho rahaa he
 While similar news has been published in the name of Lohani Sahab that he has asked the zonal officials to improve the time
 us aadesh kaa kya riselt niklaa, wo bataanaa chahie tha
 At that time, after listening to the Railway Minister, he felt that he had not heard it before
 pitiai ke hawaale se khabar ai he ki rail mantri ne sabhi zone pramukhon ko chetavanee di he ki agar ek maheene main trainon ke let chalane main sudhaar nahin hua he to unke pramotion ke dauraan moolyankan par asar padegaa
 While you heard the Railway Minister and Chairman Railway Board many times that the track capacity has not improved since 65 years, so trains are running late, will these zonal officers fix the problem of 65 years in a month
 rail mantri ko saaf kahana chahie ki samasya kahaan hai
 Is in track capacity or in the efficiency of the officers
 yaa samasya unke tarah tarah ke bayanon or faislon main he
 If the officials in Lethalifi can improve in a month for fear of stopping the promotion, then this work should have been done earlier so that many people are not harmed
 kya railmantri pehali baar jaage hai, pehali baar adhikariyon ko nirdesh de rahe hai, aisa bilkul nahin he
 He is well aware that on his Twitter handle, a large number of passengers complain of being late
 6 november 2017 ve apurva kumaar ke jawaab main likhte hai ki 'shukriya
 The government has made a lot of efforts to increase the timeliness of trains
 jinamein kshamta vistaar project or samay sarini kaa revizan bhi he
 'on 7 March 2018, tweet that' earlier there was a railway mentality that we are short of funds, then delay everything
 ab maansikta he ki har chiz ko aage badhaao or tezi se karo kyonki hamaare paas paryaapt fund he
 'on 7 March, tweeting that' the practice of recording manual punctuality in the Indian Railways was dropped from 41 major stations of all zones to increase the timeliness of trains and to inform the train status of the train at the right time
 Could
 ' 10 march ko rail mantri financial express kii story ko twit karte hai ki gudbai tu let trains yani trainon kaa let hone ko ab gudbai kah dijie
 Indian Railways has adopted these ten methods to ensure timeliness
 ' The story of the Financial Express that the Minister tweeted was that the Railway Minister wants the Indian Railways to be like the railroad of Switzerland where the watches are mixed from the time the train arrives
 ab main aapako yahaan ek tathy bataata hum, rail mantri ko to pataa hi hoga
 On 14 March, in the Parliament, the Ministry of Railways has responded that it is the policy of the railways that a vehicle reaching 15 minutes late is considered on time
 matlab 15 minute let ko aadhikarik rup se rhite time maanata he rail mantralay
 March tweets and his speeches from November show that it is in his mind to keep going late, but only he can tell what improved during this time
 unke pehle ke nirdeshon kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 On 14 March, the Minister of State for Railways has the answer in the Lok Sabha that 451 trains arrive late in the current financial year
 to phir us dauraan mantri ji ne kya ection liya, pramotion roak denge jaise hedline vaale bayaan se pehle ke unke bayanon kaa kya riselt niklaa
 We had shown in the rail series that patna-kota never lasts less than 20-25 hours
 ab usamen sudhaar aa gaya he
 But in the same Northern Railway between 10 April 2017 to 10 March 2018, 1341 Rajdhani Express arrived, 632 Duronto, 1425 Shatabdi late
 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he
 The latency rate this year is 49
 59 pratishat he yani 50 pratishat trainen let chalati hai jabaki pichley saal 31
 74 percent trains were late
 ek saal main itani vruddhi kaise ho gai, rail mantri hi bataa sakate hai, kya koi nayaa project launch ho gaya, wo project kahaan launch hua he
 If the track is the reason, can the general manager of Northern Railway really improve the running time of the vehicles within a month
 unka beepi hai ho rahaa hoga, ham samajhate hai
 There is a report of Prabhat Khabar on 20 April 2018
 raksol se narkatiyaganj ke bich 42 kimi line par navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan yani meter gej se broad gej karne kii yojana abhi tak adhuri he jabaki yah 1 april 2014 ko launch hui thi
 The 42 km line has not been built in five years
 lambii duuri ke liye is root ke logon ke liye train hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has written on Kaura that '6 every day during the Modi government
 5 kimi ke hisaab linon ke navinikaran, doharikaran or parivartan ke project launch hote hai
 'accordingly, 981 between 1 January and 31 May this year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch hue honge
 Accordingly, 2372 in the whole year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch honge
 Do you know that in the 2018-19 budget, the target is to double the 18,000 km line
 is hisaab se 18000 kimi ke saamne 2375 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa project kuch bhi nahin he
 There are plenty of statements but no evidence is found
 agar aap sunen ki upie ke samay 4
 5 km per day rail line project was launched and now 6
 5 kimi prati din launch ho rahaa he to jaldi prabhavit ho jaaenge magar yah to rail ke apane hi lakshya se bahut kam he
 In this way, if we review the statements of the Railway Minister, then the situation seems alarming
 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae
 We do not know what happened to that report and the target, whereas it would have cost the public money and time to make it
 kya 2018-19 main 18000 kimi trek kaa doharikaran, navinikaran or parivartan ho saktaa he? It is okay to have a big goal, but it should be true
 2014 se 2018 ke bich railway kul milakar 18000 kimi trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin kar pai to ek saal main kaise kar legi
 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani also said that there was to be maintenance on the Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines, but it did not work
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time
 lagata he dinemic mantri ji prime time dekhne lage hai
 It is not about reasons, it is about focus
 agar is series se focus banataa he to phir thik he
 When the capacity of the track has been utilized to the maximum, why more than 100 trains were launched every year during the Modi government
 aapane gaur kiya hoga ki rail mantri kah rahe hai ki 407 trainen isliye launch kii gayi taaki puchuality main sudhaar ho
 Then the Minister should also tell that in four years 400 trains have been launched for political reasons or for practical reasons
 jabaki kai jagahon par rail mantri or rail board ke chayaraman kehete hai ki trek kshamta kii parvaah kiye bagair pichhali sarkaron ne gaadiyaan launch kar deen jiske kaaran let ho rahi hai
 Don't you feel weird '65 saal se mumbai-chennai ke bich single trek he
 Load is 180 percent more on North East trains
 ham thik kar rahe hai
 The Railway Minister has tweeted this statement himself
 yahaan kaaran saaf he ki trek kii navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan bada kaaran he
 Will also
 lekin hamen itane bayanon main kahin nahin mila ki is root main itane kimi par kaam chal rahaa he, itane dinon se chal rahaa he or isaki tazaa sthiti ye he

 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he
 The latency rate this year is 49
 59 pratishat he yani 50 pratishat trainen let chalati hai jabaki pichley saal 31
 74 percent trains were late
 ek saal main itani vruddhi kaise ho gai, rail mantri hi bataa sakate hai, kya koi nayaa project launch ho gaya, wo project kahaan launch hua he
 If the track is the reason, can the general manager of Northern Railway really improve the running time of the vehicles within a month
 unka beepi hai ho rahaa hoga, ham samajhate hai
 There is a report of Prabhat Khabar on 20 April 2018
 raksol se narkatiyaganj ke bich 42 kimi line par navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan yani meter gej se broad gej karne kii yojana abhi tak adhuri he jabaki yah 1 april 2014 ko launch hui thi
 The 42 km line has not been built in five years
 lambii duuri ke liye is root ke logon ke liye train hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has written on Kaura that '6 every day during the Modi government
 5 kimi ke hisaab linon ke navinikaran, doharikaran or parivartan ke project launch hote hai
 'accordingly, 981 between 1 January and 31 May this year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch hue honge
 Accordingly, 2372 in the whole year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch honge
 Do you know that in the 2018-19 budget, the target is to double the 18,000 km line
 is hisaab se 18000 kimi ke saamne 2375 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa project kuch bhi nahin he
 There are plenty of statements but no evidence is found
 agar aap sunen ki upie ke samay 4
 5 km per day rail line project was launched and now 6
 5 kimi prati din launch ho rahaa he to jaldi prabhavit ho jaaenge magar yah to rail ke apane hi lakshya se bahut kam he
 In this way, if we review the statements of the Railway Minister, then the situation seems alarming
 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae
 We do not know what happened to that report and the target, whereas it would have cost the public money and time to make it
 kya 2018-19 main 18000 kimi trek kaa doharikaran, navinikaran or parivartan ho saktaa he? It is okay to have a big goal, but it should be true
 2014 se 2018 ke bich railway kul milakar 18000 kimi trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin kar pai to ek saal main kaise kar legi
 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani also said that there was to be maintenance on the Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines, but it did not work
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time
 lagata he dinemic mantri ji prime time dekhne lage hai
 It is not about reasons, it is about focus
 agar is series se focus banataa he to phir thik he
 '65 is a single track between Mumbai and Chennai
 uttar purv gadiyon par 180 pratishat zyada he lod
 We are doing fine ' rail mantri ne apana yah bayaan khud hi twit kiya he
 The reason here is clear that the renewal, doubling and gauge conversion of the track is a big reason
 hoga bhi
 But we could not find anywhere in such statements that work is going on so many km in this route, it has been running for so many days and its current status is this
 ab do khabaron kii baat karte hai
 PTI reported on 30 May 2018 that the Railway Ministry has organized a two-day workshop in which all the top officials have attended
 is news main mishan raftaar kaa zikr he
 It was found out that the mission has been going on for three years, then why its result is bad towards North India
 pitiai kii khabar main he ki mishan raftaar ke tahat agle paanch saal main yatri gaadi or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar main 25 kimi prati ghante kaa izaafaa kiya jayega
 The average speed of a passenger train is 44 km per hour and the average speed of a goods train is 25 km per hour
 internet par mili ek puraani khabar ke anusaar 2010 main rail mantri ke taur par mamata banerjee ne vijan 2020 launch kiya tha
 There was talk of running four bullet trains and the target was to increase the average speed of the remaining trains to 160-200 kmph
 magar piyush goyal to paanch saal main ausat raftaar 69 kimi prati ghante karnaa chaahate hai
 If there is no mistake in my understanding, then where did the vision 2020 that a railway minister had prepared by putting public money and what is his status
 ravivaar or somvaar ko aapane kai samachar patron or channelon par dekha hoga ki rail mantri ne railway ke sabhi 16 zone ke adhikariyon kii javabdehi tay kii he
 Many people started congratulating me that the rail series is taking effect
 jabaki isi tarah kii khabar lohani sahab ke naam se chap chuki he ki unhone zonal adhikariyon se kaha he ki samay main sudhaar karen
 What was the result of that order, they should have told
 tabhi rail mantri kii baat sunakar laga ki kahin pehle to nahin suna he
 The PTI was quoted as saying that the Railway Minister has warned all zone heads that if trains have not improved in a month, the evaluation will be affected during their promotion
 jabaki aapane rail mantri or chairman railway board ko kai baar kehete suna ki 65 saal se trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin hua isliye trainen let chal rahi hai to kya 65 saal kii samasya ye zonal adhikari ek maheene main thik kar denge
 The railway minister should clearly state where the problems lie
 trek kii kshamta main he yaa adhikariyon kii kaarykushalta main he
 Or the problem lies in their various statements and decisions
 agar letlatifi main adhikari pramotion rukne ke dar se ek maheene main sudhaar laa sakate hai to vaaki ye kaam pehle kiya janaa chahie tha taaki kai logon ko nuksaan nahin hota
 Is the Railway Minister awake for the first time, giving instructions to officers for the first time, is not so at all
 unhen thik se pataa he ki unke twitor handle par rose badi sankhya main yatri let hone kii shikaayat karte hai
 6 November 2017 He writes in response to Apoorva Kumar that 'thank you
 trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne bahut saare prayaas kiye hai
 Including revision of capacity expansion project and time table
 ' 7 march 2018 ko twit karte hai ki 'pehle railway kii maansikta thi ki hamaare paas fund kii kami he to sab kuch deree kar do
 Now the mindset is to pursue everything and do it fast because we have enough funds
 ' 7 march ko twit karte hai ki 'bhartiya rail main haath se samaybaddhata ko ricard karne kaa abhyaas sabhi zonon ke 41 bade steshnon se hataa diya gaya taaki trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaai ja sake or sawari ko sahi samay main train kii sthiti kii jaankaree di ja sake
 On March 10, the Railway Minister tweets the story of Financial Express that Goodbye to Late trains means that trains are late and now say Goodbye
 bhartiya railway ne samaybaddhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye ye das tareeke apanaae hai
 ' financial express kii jis story ko mantri ne twit kiya tha ki wo yah thi ki rail mantri chaahate hai ki bhartiya rail sweetsraland ke rail kii tarah honi chahie jahaan ghadiyaan train ke pahunchane ke time se milaai jaati hai
 Now let me tell you a fact here, the Railway Minister would know
 isi 14 march ko sansad main rail mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki rail kii niti he ki 15 minute kii deree tak pahunchane vaali gaadi ko samay par mana jaataa he
 That is, the Ministry of Railways officially considers 15 minutes late as Right Time
 nanvabar se march ke twit or unke bhaashan bataate hai ki let chalane kii baat unke dimag main he magar vahi bataa sakate hai ki is dauraan kya sudhaar hua
 What was the result of his earlier instructions
 14 march ko rail rajya mantri kaa hi jawaab he loksabhaa main ki maujuuda vitt varsh main har din 451 gaadiyaan deree se pahunchati hai
 Then what action did the minister take during that time, will stop the promotion like what was the result of his statements before the headline statement
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he
 Accordingly, there is nothing to improve the capacity of 2375 km lines in front of 18000 km
 bayaan to khub milte hai magar pramaan nahin milte hai
 If you hear that at the time of UPA 4
 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 30 may 2018 kii pitiai kii khabar he ki rail mantralay ne do dinon kii kaaryshaala yojit kii he jisamen sabhi bade adhikari shaamil hue hai
 Mission speed is mentioned in this news
 pataa chalaa ki teen saal se mishan raftaar chal rahaa he phir iskaa rigelt uttar bharat kii taraf kharaab kyon he
 PTI reports that under the mission speed, in the next five years, the average speed of passenger car and goods train will be increased to 25 km per hour
 is vakt yatri gaadi kii ausat raftaar 44 kimi prati ghanta he or maal gaadi kii ausat raftaar 25 kimi prati ghanta he
 According to an old news on internet, Mamata Banerjee launched Vision 2020 in 2010 as Railway Minister
 chaar bullate train chalaane kii baat thi usamen or baaki gadiyon kii ausat raftaar 160-200 kimi prati ghante kiye jane kaa lakshya tha
 But Piyush Goyal wants to reach an average speed of 69 kmph in five years
 agar mere samajhane main koi chook nahin hui he to wo vijan 2020 kahaan gaya jise ek railmantri ne janata ke paise lagaakar taiyaar kiya tha or uskaa states kya he
 On Sunday and Monday, you must have seen on many newspapers and channels that the Railway Minister has fixed the accountability of the officials of all the 16 zones of the railway
 kai log mujhe badhai dene lage ki rail siries kaa asar ho rahaa he
 While similar news has been published in the name of Lohani Sahab that he has asked the zonal officials to improve the time
 us aadesh kaa kya riselt niklaa, wo bataanaa chahie tha
 At that time, after listening to the Railway Minister, he felt that he had not heard it before
 pitiai ke hawaale se khabar ai he ki rail mantri ne sabhi zone pramukhon ko chetavanee di he ki agar ek maheene main trainon ke let chalane main sudhaar nahin hua he to unke pramotion ke dauraan moolyankan par asar padegaa
 While you heard the Railway Minister and Chairman Railway Board many times that the track capacity has not improved since 65 years, so trains are running late, will these zonal officers fix the problem of 65 years in a month
 rail mantri ko saaf kahana chahie ki samasya kahaan hai
 Is in track capacity or in the efficiency of the officers
 yaa samasya unke tarah tarah ke bayanon or faislon main he
 If the officials in Lethalifi can improve in a month for fear of stopping the promotion, then this work should have been done earlier so that many people are not harmed
 kya railmantri pehali baar jaage hai, pehali baar adhikariyon ko nirdesh de rahe hai, aisa bilkul nahin he
 He is well aware that on his Twitter handle, a large number of passengers complain of being late
 6 november 2017 ve apurva kumaar ke jawaab main likhte hai ki 'shukriya
 The government has made a lot of efforts to increase the timeliness of trains
 jinamein kshamta vistaar project or samay sarini kaa revizan bhi he
 'on 7 March 2018, tweet that' earlier there was a railway mentality that we are short of funds, then delay everything
 ab maansikta he ki har chiz ko aage badhaao or tezi se karo kyonki hamaare paas paryaapt fund he
 'on 7 March, tweeting that' the practice of recording manual punctuality in the Indian Railways was dropped from 41 major stations of all zones to increase the timeliness of trains and to inform the train status of the train at the right time
 Could
 ' 10 march ko rail mantri financial express kii story ko twit karte hai ki gudbai tu let trains yani trainon kaa let hone ko ab gudbai kah dijie
 Indian Railways has adopted these ten methods to ensure timeliness
 ' The story of the Financial Express that the Minister tweeted was that the Railway Minister wants the Indian Railways to be like the railroad of Switzerland where the watches are mixed from the time the train arrives
 ab main aapako yahaan ek tathy bataata hum, rail mantri ko to pataa hi hoga
 On 14 March, in the Parliament, the Ministry of Railways has responded that it is the policy of the railways that a vehicle reaching 15 minutes late is considered on time
 matlab 15 minute let ko aadhikarik rup se rhite time maanata he rail mantralay
 March tweets and his speeches from November show that it is in his mind to keep going late, but only he can tell what improved during this time
 unke pehle ke nirdeshon kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 On 14 March, the Minister of State for Railways has the answer in the Lok Sabha that 451 trains arrive late in the current financial year
 to phir us dauraan mantri ji ne kya ection liya, pramotion roak denge jaise hedline vaale bayaan se pehle ke unke bayanon kaa kya riselt niklaa
 We had shown in the rail series that patna-kota never lasts less than 20-25 hours
 ab usamen sudhaar aa gaya he
 But in the same Northern Railway between 10 April 2017 to 10 March 2018, 1341 Rajdhani Express arrived, 632 Duronto, 1425 Shatabdi late
 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he

 jinamein kshamta vistaar project or samay sarini kaa revizan bhi he
 'on 7 March 2018, tweet that' earlier there was a railway mentality that we are short of funds, then delay everything
 ab maansikta he ki har chiz ko aage badhaao or tezi se karo kyonki hamaare paas paryaapt fund he
 'on 7 March, tweeting that' the practice of recording manual punctuality in the Indian Railways was dropped from 41 major stations of all zones to increase the timeliness of trains and to inform the train status of the train at the right time
 Could
 ' 10 march ko rail mantri financial express kii story ko twit karte hai ki gudbai tu let trains yani trainon kaa let hone ko ab gudbai kah dijie
 Indian Railways has adopted these ten methods to ensure timeliness
 ' The story of the Financial Express that the Minister tweeted was that the Railway Minister wants the Indian Railways to be like the railroad of Switzerland where the watches are mixed from the time the train arrives
 ab main aapako yahaan ek tathy bataata hum, rail mantri ko to pataa hi hoga
 On 14 March, in the Parliament, the Ministry of Railways has responded that it is the policy of the railways that a vehicle reaching 15 minutes late is considered on time
 matlab 15 minute let ko aadhikarik rup se rhite time maanata he rail mantralay
 March tweets and his speeches from November show that it is in his mind to keep going late, but only he can tell what improved during this time
 unke pehle ke nirdeshon kaa kya nateeja niklaa
 On 14 March, the Minister of State for Railways has the answer in the Lok Sabha that 451 trains arrive late in the current financial year
 to phir us dauraan mantri ji ne kya ection liya, pramotion roak denge jaise hedline vaale bayaan se pehle ke unke bayanon kaa kya riselt niklaa
 We had shown in the rail series that patna-kota never lasts less than 20-25 hours
 ab usamen sudhaar aa gaya he
 But in the same Northern Railway between 10 April 2017 to 10 March 2018, 1341 Rajdhani Express arrived, 632 Duronto, 1425 Shatabdi late
 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he
 The latency rate this year is 49
 59 pratishat he yani 50 pratishat trainen let chalati hai jabaki pichley saal 31
 74 percent trains were late
 ek saal main itani vruddhi kaise ho gai, rail mantri hi bataa sakate hai, kya koi nayaa project launch ho gaya, wo project kahaan launch hua he
 If the track is the reason, can the general manager of Northern Railway really improve the running time of the vehicles within a month
 unka beepi hai ho rahaa hoga, ham samajhate hai
 There is a report of Prabhat Khabar on 20 April 2018
 raksol se narkatiyaganj ke bich 42 kimi line par navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan yani meter gej se broad gej karne kii yojana abhi tak adhuri he jabaki yah 1 april 2014 ko launch hui thi
 The 42 km line has not been built in five years
 lambii duuri ke liye is root ke logon ke liye train hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has written on Kaura that '6 every day during the Modi government
 5 kimi ke hisaab linon ke navinikaran, doharikaran or parivartan ke project launch hote hai
 'accordingly, 981 between 1 January and 31 May this year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch hue honge
 Accordingly, 2372 in the whole year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch honge
 Do you know that in the 2018-19 budget, the target is to double the 18,000 km line
 is hisaab se 18000 kimi ke saamne 2375 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa project kuch bhi nahin he
 There are plenty of statements but no evidence is found
 agar aap sunen ki upie ke samay 4
 5 km per day rail line project was launched and now 6
 5 kimi prati din launch ho rahaa he to jaldi prabhavit ho jaaenge magar yah to rail ke apane hi lakshya se bahut kam he
 In this way, if we review the statements of the Railway Minister, then the situation seems alarming
 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae
 We do not know what happened to that report and the target, whereas it would have cost the public money and time to make it
 kya 2018-19 main 18000 kimi trek kaa doharikaran, navinikaran or parivartan ho saktaa he? It is okay to have a big goal, but it should be true
 2014 se 2018 ke bich railway kul milakar 18000 kimi trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin kar pai to ek saal main kaise kar legi
 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani also said that there was to be maintenance on the Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines, but it did not work
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time
 lagata he dinemic mantri ji prime time dekhne lage hai
 It is not about reasons, it is about focus
 agar is series se focus banataa he to phir thik he
 The PTI was quoted as saying that the Railway Minister has warned all zone heads that if trains have not improved in a month, the evaluation will be affected during their promotion
 jabaki aapane rail mantri or chairman railway board ko kai baar kehete suna ki 65 saal se trek kii kshamta main sudhaar nahin hua isliye trainen let chal rahi hai to kya 65 saal kii samasya ye zonal adhikari ek maheene main thik kar denge
 The railway minister should clearly state where the problems lie
 trek kii kshamta main he yaa adhikariyon kii kaarykushalta main he
 Or the problem lies in their various statements and decisions
 agar letlatifi main adhikari pramotion rukne ke dar se ek maheene main sudhaar laa sakate hai to vaaki ye kaam pehle kiya janaa chahie tha taaki kai logon ko nuksaan nahin hota
 Is the Railway Minister awake for the first time, giving instructions to officers for the first time, is not so at all
 unhen thik se pataa he ki unke twitor handle par rose badi sankhya main yatri let hone kii shikaayat karte hai
 6 November 2017 He writes in response to Apoorva Kumar that 'thank you
 trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaane ke liye sarkaar ne bahut saare prayaas kiye hai
 Including revision of capacity expansion project and time table
 ' 7 march 2018 ko twit karte hai ki 'pehle railway kii maansikta thi ki hamaare paas fund kii kami he to sab kuch deree kar do
 Now the mindset is to pursue everything and do it fast because we have enough funds
 ' 7 march ko twit karte hai ki 'bhartiya rail main haath se samaybaddhata ko ricard karne kaa abhyaas sabhi zonon ke 41 bade steshnon se hataa diya gaya taaki trainon kii samaybaddhata badhaai ja sake or sawari ko sahi samay main train kii sthiti kii jaankaree di ja sake
 On March 10, the Railway Minister tweets the story of Financial Express that Goodbye to Late trains means that trains are late and now say Goodbye
 bhartiya railway ne samaybaddhata ko sunishchit karne ke liye ye das tareeke apanaae hai
 ' financial express kii jis story ko mantri ne twit kiya tha ki wo yah thi ki rail mantri chaahate hai ki bhartiya rail sweetsraland ke rail kii tarah honi chahie jahaan ghadiyaan train ke pahunchane ke time se milaai jaati hai
 Now let me tell you a fact here, the Railway Minister would know
 isi 14 march ko sansad main rail mantralay ne jawaab diya he ki rail kii niti he ki 15 minute kii deree tak pahunchane vaali gaadi ko samay par mana jaataa he
 That is, the Ministry of Railways officially considers 15 minutes late as Right Time
 nanvabar se march ke twit or unke bhaashan bataate hai ki let chalane kii baat unke dimag main he magar vahi bataa sakate hai ki is dauraan kya sudhaar hua
 What was the result of his earlier instructions
 14 march ko rail rajya mantri kaa hi jawaab he loksabhaa main ki maujuuda vitt varsh main har din 451 gaadiyaan deree se pahunchati hai
 Then what action did the minister take during that time, will stop the promotion like what was the result of his statements before the headline statement
 hamane rail series main dikhaaya tha ki patna-kota kabhi 20-25 ghate se kam let nahin chalati he
 Now it has improved
 lekin isi uttar railway main 10 april 2017 se 10 march 2018 ke bich 1341 rajdhani express, 632 duranton, 1425 shatabdi let se pahunchi
 Meaning VIP trains are also running late and do not ask the condition of Bhagalpur Garib Rath
 chakra aa jayega
 PTI has reported in the promotion news that the maximum number of trains are running in North India
 is saal let hone kii dar 49
 59 per cent means 50 per cent trains are late while 31 last year
 74 pratishat trainen let chali thim
 How has there been so much growth in a year, only the Railway Minister can tell, whether a new project has been launched, where has that project been launched
 agar trek kaaran he to kya uttar railway ke general manager ek maheene ke andar vaaki gadiyon ke samay se chalane main sudhaar kar sakate hai
 His BP must be getting high, we understand
 20 april 2018 ko prabhaat khabar kii ek report he
 The 42 km line between Raxaul to Narkatiaganj is still incomplete with plans to upgrade, doubling and gauge conversion from meter gauge to broad gauge, when it was launched on 1 April 2014
 paanch saal main 42 kimi line nahin ban pai he
 The train is the only option for people on this route for long distances
 rail mantri piyush goyal ne kaura par likhaa he ki 'modi sarkaar ke daur main har din 6
 Projects of renovation, doubling and conversion of 5 km lines are launched
 ' is hisaab se is saal 1 janvari se 31 may ke bich 981
 Projects to improve the capacity of the 5 km lines would have been launched
 is hisaab se puure saal main 2372
 Projects to improve capacity of 5 km lines will be launched
 kya aapako pataa he ki 2018-19 ke bajet main lakshya 18,000 kimi line ke dabl karne kaa he
 Accordingly, there is nothing to improve the capacity of 2375 km lines in front of 18000 km
 bayaan to khub milte hai magar pramaan nahin milte hai
 If you hear that at the time of UPA 4
 5 kimi prati din rail line kaa project launch hota tha or ab 6
 Launching 5 km per day will affect you soon but it is far less than the rail's own goal
 is tarah se agar ham rail mantri ke bayanon kii samiksha karen to chintajanak sthiti nazar aati he
 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii
 If this series creates focus then it is fine
 kya railmantri pehali baar jaage hai, pehali baar adhikariyon ko nirdesh de rahe hai, aisa bilkul nahin he
 He is well aware that on his Twitter handle, a large number of passengers complain of being late
 6 november 2017 ve apurva kumaar ke jawaab main likhte hai ki 'shukriya

 Looking at these figures, it seems that the statement is the proof
 pramaan benishaan hai
 There is something in the budget, there is something else in the Standing Committee
 koi padhata bhi he to yahaan hami log pard rahe hai khaskar shivank hi padhate rahete hai jinaki madad se in dastavezon tak pahunchaa hum
 There was a target of renovation of 2828 km old lines in 2016-17
 2017-18 ke liye bhi itnaa hi lakshya tha, donon kaa kya states he ham nahin jaanate
 The comments kya yah sab kuch hasil e hedline ke liye ho rahaa he
 If Piyush Goyal does not mind that i want to mention a statement of Ashwani Lohani which he has said in an interview to Doordarshan
 ve kehete hai ki mentanence par dhyaan diya ja rahaa he jo pichley saal tak puure tareeke se dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa tha
 This decision was taken when accidents occurred
 ab kar rahe hai
 Lohani also said that there was to be maintenance on the Lucknow and Mughalsarai lines, but it did not work
 isaki javabdehi kiski thi yaa kiski he
 Someone will explain why the track was not being maintained
 kyon isaki upeksha kii gai? kya pichley saal gaadiyaan let nahin chal rahi thim? hamane rail series main bataaya tha ki kai gaadiyaan ek-ek saal se 30-30 ghante let chal rahi thim
 The capital, Duranto Shatabdi, was also running late
 rail mantri ji 407 gaadiyaan shuru karne ko uplabdhi maanate hai, railway board ke chairman samasya yaa chunauti maanate hai
 It is better to talk to each other
 rail bajet, standing cameti, board chairman or rail mantri ek baat karen to thik rahegaa
 At least the Railway Minister and the Chairman of the Railway Board should talk among themselves
 agar rail mantralay hamaare tathyon ke sangyojan main kuch kamiyaan ujagar karata he to use chuttee se lautne ke baad zarur shaamil karuunga
 The report appeared in the New Indian Express on June 2 that the ticket cancellation has received Rs 2,760 crore from the Railways in the last two years
 yah aankada hairaan karne vaala he
 There is no charge for cancellation of tickets for air passenger, Jayant Sinha gives such a proposal, but Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has such strict rules of cancellation of tickets in the ministry that the common passenger is being looted
 jab trek par boj he to phir railmantri trainon ko launch kyon kar rahe hai
 At the same time, when they are calling the launch of new trains a problem, that is why on June 2, they are launching a Humsafar from Jodhpur to Banda, in a statement, they have said that the Bombay Chenna route has been single for 65 years
 magar us maarg par to train let nahin he
 Lohani has told Doordarshan that trains are mostly running late in the north
 ek maheene main jodhpur se yah duusari nai train chali he
 On that occasion you can hear in the speech of the minister how much he is worried about the time
 lagata he dinemic mantri ji prime time dekhne lage hai
 It is not about reasons, it is about focus
 agar is series se focus banataa he to phir thik he
 We had shown in the rail series that patna-kota never lasts less than 20-25 hours
 ab usamen sudhaar aa gaya he
 But in the same Northern Railway between 10 April 2017 to 10 March 2018, 1341 Rajdhani Express arrived, 632 Duronto, 1425 Shatabdi late
 matlab viipi train bhi let se chal rahi hai or bhagalpur garib rath kaa haal to puuchhie hi mat
 The cycle will come
 pitiai ne pramotion vaali khabar main bataaya he ki sabase adhik train uttar bharat main chal rahi he
 The latency rate this year is 49
 59 pratishat he yani 50 pratishat trainen let chalati hai jabaki pichley saal 31
 74 percent trains were late
 ek saal main itani vruddhi kaise ho gai, rail mantri hi bataa sakate hai, kya koi nayaa project launch ho gaya, wo project kahaan launch hua he
 If the track is the reason, can the general manager of Northern Railway really improve the running time of the vehicles within a month
 unka beepi hai ho rahaa hoga, ham samajhate hai
 There is a report of Prabhat Khabar on 20 April 2018
 raksol se narkatiyaganj ke bich 42 kimi line par navinikaran, doharikaran or amman parivartan yani meter gej se broad gej karne kii yojana abhi tak adhuri he jabaki yah 1 april 2014 ko launch hui thi
 The 42 km line has not been built in five years
 lambii duuri ke liye is root ke logon ke liye train hi ekmaatr vikalp he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has written on Kaura that '6 every day during the Modi government
 5 kimi ke hisaab linon ke navinikaran, doharikaran or parivartan ke project launch hote hai
 'accordingly, 981 between 1 January and 31 May this year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch hue honge
 Accordingly, 2372 in the whole year
 5 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar ke project launch honge
 Do you know that in the 2018-19 budget, the target is to double the 18,000 km line
 is hisaab se 18000 kimi ke saamne 2375 kimi linon kii kshamta main sudhaar kaa project kuch bhi nahin he
 There are plenty of statements but no evidence is found

 5 km per day rail line project was launched and now 6
 5 kimi prati din launch ho rahaa he to jaldi prabhavit ho jaaenge magar yah to rail ke apane hi lakshya se bahut kam he
 In this way, if we review the statements of the Railway Minister, then the situation seems alarming
 sam pitroda cameti ne 2012 main suzav diya tha ki 2012-17 ke bich 18,000 kimi rail line ko aadhunik banaaya jaae

 The Sam Pitroda Committee suggested in 2012 that the 18,000 km railway line be modernized between 2012-17
 us report or lakshya kaa kya hua ham nahin jaanate jabaki use banane main janata kaa hi paisa or samay laga hoga
 Can 18000 km of track be doubled, refurbished and changed in 2018-19? lakshya bada ho thik he magar sahi to ho
 Between 2014 and 2018, the railways could not improve the total capacity of the 18000 km track, so how will it do in a year
 in aankadon ko dekh kar yahi lagata he ki bayaan hi pramaan he
 The evidence is poor
 bajet main kuch he, standing cameti main kuch or he
 Even if someone studies, our people are studying here, especially Shivank only keeps reading, with whose help i have reached these documents
 2016-17 main 2828 kimi puraani linon ke navinikaran kaa lakshya tha
 We had the same goal for 2017-18, we do not know what the status of both are
 tippaniyan Is this all happening for Achieve a Headline
 agar piyush goyal ko bura na lage ki ashvini lohani ke ek bayaan kaa zikr karnaa chahta hum jo unhone doordarshan ko die intervyuu main kaha he
 They say that attention is being paid to maintenance, which was not being given full attention till last year
 jab durghatnaayen huin tab ye nirnay liya gaya
 Doing now
 lohani ji ne yah bhi kaha ki lakhanu or mughalsarai line par mentanence hona tha magar uskaa kaam nahin hua
 Whose or whose responsibility was it? koi batayega ki trek kaa mentanence kyon nahin ho rahaa tha
 Why was it ignored? Were vehicles not running late last year? We had told in the rail series that many trains were running late for 30 hours every year
 rajdhani, duranton shatabdi bhi deree se chal rahi thim
 The Railway Minister considers the introduction of 407 vehicles as an achievement, the Chairman of the Railway Board considers the problem or challenge
 behatar he donon aapas main baat kar len
 Rail Budget, Standing Committee, Board Chairman and Railway Minister will be fine if we talk one thing
 kam se kam rail mantri or railway board ke chairman ko aapas main baat kar lenaa chahie
 If the Ministry of Railways reveals some shortcomings in the combination of our facts, we will definitely include it after returning from leave
 2 june ke new indian express main report chhapi he ki pichley do saal main railway ko tikat cancellesan ne 2,760 karod rupee mili hai
 This figure is surprising
 hawaii yatri ko tikat cancil karne se koi shulk nahin lagegaa, aisa prastaav jayant sinha dete hai magar rail mantri piyush goyal ke mantralay main tikat cancel karne ke itane kade niyam hai ki aam yatri lut rahaa he
 When there is a burden on the track, then why are the railway ministers launching trains
 jis samay ve nai trainon ke launch ko samasya bataa rahe hai usee samay yani 2 june ko jodhpur se banda ke liye humsafar ko launch kyon kar rahe hai jabaki ek bayaan main ve kah chuke hai ki bombai chenna maarg 65 saal se single padaa he
 But the train is not lying on that route
 lohani ji ne doordarshan se kaha he ki train zyaadaatar uttar main let chal rahi hai
 This is the second new train from Jodhpur in a month
 us maukey par mantri ji ke bhaashan main aap sun sakate hai ki ve samay ko lekar kitna pareshaan hai
 It seems that the dynamic minister has started watching prime time
 baat kaarnon kii nahin he, baat he focus kii

 On 10 September, RJD has organized a rally against the creation scam in Bhagalpur called 'immersion of the wicked of creation' rally
 sabase dilachasp baat yah he ki lalu aaj hi apane donon beton ke saath bhagalpur pahunch jaaenge

 It is worth noting that when Lalu was the railway minister at the center from 2004 to 2009, he used to travel a lot in rail at that time but after that he almost gave up the journey
 27 agast ko patna ke gandhi maidan main jab argedy kidesh bachaao bhaajapa bhagaao ralihui thi to usee dauraan purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ne elaan kar diya tha ki vah bahut jald bhagalpur main 'srijan ke durjanon kaa visarjan' raily karenge jiske baad is kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya he

 corporate laalach ne east india company ko kar diya khatm2g or koyala ghotaale ne upie ko satta se kiya baharkisi bhi cheez kii jyaadati acchhee nahin he
 Be it greed, business or technology
 is baat ko scottish itihaaskaar wiliam delerimpal ne apni nai kitaab 'di anarki' main samajhane kii koshish kii he
 He says that just as corporate greed brought the East India Company to an end, the 2G and coal scam ended Congress power
 itihaaskaar wiliam delerimpal ne apni kitaab 'di anarki' main east india company ke udai or utthan se lekar uske khatm hone tak kii puri kahani bayaan kii he
 He told how the London-based East India Company captured Mughal power and became so powerful
 east india ne mughal samrajya khatm kar satta hathiyaanunhone bataaya ki bhartiya mahadweep main kaarobaar karne ke liye saal 1600 main landan main east india company kii sthapana kii gai
 The company expanded so much that it occupied large parts of the Indian subcontinent, the colonized part of Southeast Asia, and Hong Kong after the war with King China
 is company ne hindustan main shaktishaalee mughal samrajya ko khatm karke satta apane haath main le liya
 William Dalrymple, in his book The Anarchy, also denied the notion that India's colonization was the beginning of Britain's national project
 darasal, east india company kii sthapana kaa makasad privet jwoint stock company ke jariye corporate phaayde ko badhanaa tha, jo aage chalakar bharat ke upniveshikaran kaa kaaran ban gai
 William Dalrymple said that we often forget history and loss in the greed for corporate profits
 kaise marwari or jain bankeron ne kii british company kii madadwilim delerimpal ne kaha ki jab east india company bharat ai to bengal ke marwari or jain bankeron kii madad se apane kaamkaaj ko shuru kiya
 The East India Company, with the help of Marwari and Jain bankers, gradually progressed its operations
 iske patna or banaras ke hindu bankeron ne bhi east india company kii madad kii
 In this way, the Indians together helped to increase the East India Company in India
 mughal satta ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye paise kii peshkashus samay ke sabase amir bhartiya banker jagat seth ne bengal ke nawab sirajuddaula kii satta ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye britishon ko uksaaya tha
 Along with this, 20 million Euros were offered to do so
 east india company jaanati thi ki bhartiya sipaahiyon or paise se mughalon ko haraaya ja saktaa he
 Now the question arises here whether Hindu businessmen had a hatred towards Muslim rulers, due to which they gave money to the East India Company to end Mughal rule? He said that this is not completely true
 unka kahana he ki jagat seth ko lagata tha ki unka paisa mughalon kii bajaay east india company ke paas zyada surakshit he
 It is interesting how corporate violence brought the Mughal empire to an end
 kaise east india company ne bharat par kar liya kabja?wiliam delerimpal ne kaha ki british sarkaar ne 31 disambar 1600 ko east india company kii sthapana ko manjuuri di
 After this the East India Company grew faster than expected
 iske jariye kshetra ke kaarobaar main britain kaa prabhutv sthapit ho gaya
 After this the company began to interfere in power and gradually the East India Company took over power, law and order and the whole country
 company ne kanoon bananaa or yuddh tak ladanaa shuru kar diya
 According to the ruling Indian Army of India lost to the East India Company, most historians focus more on the Mughal period and then the freedom struggle, they do not focus much on the East India Company
 haalanki us samay kaa england corporate laalach ke badhate khatre se waakif tha
 If the British newspaper of that time was seen in reverse, then the media of that time also criticized it
 wiliam delerimpal kaa kahana he ki corporate laalach ko lekar british sansad main bahes bhi hui thi, jisamen is baat kii charchaa kii gai thi ki kis tarah east india company ne itane bade bhu-bhaag par kabja kar liya
 After this, the East India Company lost its faith in the British Parliament and the British Government snatched away the power of India from the East India Company
 laalach main satta se takaraane lagata he corporatwilliam delerimpal ne kaha ki corporate zyada phayda paane se zyada laalchee ho jaataa he
 After this, he starts hitting on the government and power
 unhone kaha ki aisa hi upie ke shashan main 2G or koyala ghotaale hue, jiskaa khamiyaja yah hua ki congress ko satta se haath dhonaa padaa
 William Dalrymple's The Anarchy is not just a history book, but a reminder of the loss from Belgaum Corporate

 pakistan main carch se ho rahi he ladakiyon kii taskari, padri aise kar rahe hai sauda
 
 
 Pakistan and India often arrest fishermen as there is no clear demarcation of the maritime boundary in the Arabian Sea and these fishermen do not have boats equipped with technology to know their exact position

 If you also think that everything happens after marriage, as shown in romantic films, then definitely meet a married woman
 aamtaur par kunari ladakiyon ke man main shaadi ko lekar tarah-tarah kii pari-kathaayen chalati rahati he
 They think that after marriage, every girl finds a person who takes care of them, loves them, takes them to shopping, makes tea and gives it to them
 
 
 aisi ladakiyon ko ekbar un ladakiyon se jarur milanaa chahie jinakiabhi-abhi shaadi hui he
 Every girl decorates different dreams about her marriage and her later life, but the reality is that real life is very different from dream world
 ye wo 11 baaten he jo har ladki ko shaadi ke pehle jarur jaan leni chahie
 1
 agar aap partiyaan karke, doston ke saath gum-ghumkar bor ho chuki hai or ab shaadi karke aise ek shaks ke saath rahanaa chaahati hai jo aapkaa khyaal rakhe to behatar hoga ki aap shaadi na karen
 To get all this, you have to take responsibility of every small and big work in the house and if you are not ready for this then marriage is not for you
 2
 Life changes completely after marriage
 kai baar aapako apni chwis ko bhulaakar rishton ko praathamikta deni padati he
 People always expect your hundred percent from you, but think about it for you, it is not necessary
 3
 If you do not have tolerance, then marriage is not for you because after marriage you have to listen to your husband's snoring someday, then someday you have to stand in the kitchen to make the mother-in-law happy
 4
 After marriage, there are many occasions when you have to forcefully agree
 aapako koi baat pasand na bhi aae to bhi aapako haa main hi jawaab dena padataa he
 5
 shaadi ke baad kii jindagi pariyon kii kahaniyon se bilkul alag hoti he
 It is not necessary to have romantic things between you and your partner everyday
 pyaar ke saath hi ladaai bhi is rishte kaa ek khaas pahalu he
 6
 shaadi ke pehle tak bhale hi aap sach ko sach or jhooth ko jhooth bolne vaali rahi hon lekin shaadi ke baad zyaadaatar ladakiyon ko kootneetijna bananaa padataa he
 7
 agar aapako ye lagata he ki aap sabhi ko khush rakh sakati hai to aap galat hai
 No matter what you do, you cannot keep everyone happy
 8
 You and your partner should always talk lovingly after marriage
 shaadi ke baad kai aise maukey aate hai jab aapke or apakepartner bich bolchaal bandaho jaati he
 9
 shaadi ke baad kai baar aise maukey aate hai jab lagata he ki aap donon sirf naam ke hi pati-patni hai
 10
 agar aapke rishte main khatas aa gai he to is baat kii ummid bhi mat karen ki ek din achaanak se koi chamatkaar hoga or sabakuch thik ho jayega
 11
 shaadi ke baad aapako kai un chizon ko hansate-hansate sweekaar karnaa padataa he jin chizon ko lekar aap pehle bahut chidhati hongi
