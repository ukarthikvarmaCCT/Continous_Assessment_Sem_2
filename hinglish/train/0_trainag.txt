 Supriya was brought to the state capital from a private hospital in Nalgonda, 101 km from Hyderabad and admitted to a bigger private hospital after the symptoms of dengue began to reach critical condition, that is, bleeding started inside and outside the body
 
 supriya ko hyderabad ke nijee aspataal main ek din ICU main rakhaa gaya, or agali dopaher uski maut ho gai
 By then, her two younger siblings - seven-year-old Suryanarayana and five-year-old Sanjana - were also admitted to the ICU of the same hospital
 45,000 rupee kaa bhugtan kar dene ke baad supriya kaa shav uske parivaar ko saunpa gaya
 Earlier, he had also paid Rs 50,000 for emergency critical care on the first day
 supriya ke pita uske antim sanskaar main shaamil nahin ho paae, kyonki vah ICU main bhartee apni donon choti santanon ke saath aspataal main maujuud the
 Supriya's mother took her daughter's body to her hometown in Nellore district for the funeral
 sitambar maah ke dauraan telugana main dengue ke lagbhag 3,000 maamle report kiye gaye hai
 There have been 56 deaths officially due to dengue so far, but the state government claims that there have been no deaths from dengue so far this year, while hospitals have cleared the cause of death in the death certificate
 - Clean dengue is written
 telugana ke swasthya mantri etela rajinder ne kaha, "kis tarah ke test kiye gaye, yah jaanchane ke baad jab sarkaar dwaara gathit kii gai cameti dengue se hui maut kii pushti kar detii he, tab ham use dengue se hui maut maanate hai
 
 
 "like Supriya, many families have been given large sums of money for the treatment of dengue
 sarkaar ne iskaa thikra nijee aspataalon par phoda he, or kaha he ki nijee aspataal logon ko daraa rahe hai, or unki chintaaon se phayda uthaa rahe hai
 The platelet count of Supriya's sister in a hospital in Hyderabad had fallen very low, and her brother's blood pressure was so low that it could not even be recorded
 khayr, parivaar ke liye raahat kii baat yah rahi ki sanjana ko mangalvaar ko aspataal se chuttee de di gai thi, tathaa suryanarayan kii haalat bhi sthir he, or use bhi jald hi discharge kiya ja saktaa he
 Hospital bill 2
 33 lakh rupee kaa rahaa
 Supriya's cousin Gopi told NDTV, "we paid nearly one lakh rupees for treatment in Supriya's hospital, Rs 50,000 for Suryanarayana and the rest for Sanjana
 
 
 " gopi ke mutabik, usee aspataal main bacchon ke ward main kam se kam 20 bachche dengue se peedit paae gaye the

 nageshwar raav ko bataaya gaya ki dengue ke ilaaj par hone vaale kharch ko telugana sarkaar kii swasthya beemaa yojana 'aarogyshri' ke tahat cover nahin kiya ja saktaa

 nageshwar raav ne aspataal kaa bill chukaane ke liye nijee rup se karz liya he, jis par unhen 24 pratishat salanaa kii dar se byaaj bhi chukaana hoga, yani, is parivaar ke liye museebaton kaa daur khatm nahin hua he - na maansik rup se, na vittiya rup se
 
 
 The Telangana government has bandaged the mouths of private hospitals saying that they cannot spread fear
 reporton ke mutabik, sarkaar ne uchit nidaan ke liye aspataalon ko notice jari kiya he
 In fact, many private hospitals were accused of making fake cases by doing rapid tests instead of confirming dengue through NS1 antigen and ELISA tests

 is hafte release hui filmon main se ek he 'maazi', jiskaa arth hota he bhootkaal
 
 
 Jaideep Chopra is the director of 'mazi', and Mona Vasu is stepping into Bollywood with this film, which you have seen on the small screen
 
 
 'maazi' main mona vaasu ke saath hai sumit nizaavan, jo film ke ko−riter bhi hai
 
 
 Apart from these, 'mazi' also has actors like Pankaj Tripathi and Zakir Hussain
 
 
 'maazi' kahani he tarun singh kii, jo apni patni or bacchee ke saath ek shant or khushhaal zindagi bitaa rahaa he or unki phulon kii ek dukaan he
 
 
 Tarun is a person of calm nature, but something happens to him that his life goes on a different path
 
 
 zyada jaanane ke liye film dekhni hogi
 
 
 Now i would like to say about this film that Jaideep Chopra, who is also the producer of the film, has tried to tell an honest story in an honest way
 
 
 bataur nirdeshak vah apni pehali film ko masala film bhi bana sakate the, lekin unhone ek aisi kahani chuni, jo manoranjan ke saath-saath sandesh bhi detii he
 
 
 The comments mona vaasu kaa abhinay acha he
 
 
 i would like to praise Sumit Nizhavan as a writer more than acting
 
 
 bataur actor abhi unhen khud par kaam karne kii zarurat he, lekin unki acchhee baat yah he ki puri film main vah over-acting kahin nahin karte
 
 
 Pankaj Tripathi, Zakir Hussain, Zeeshan and Manav Kaushik also make a mark with their acting
 
 
 film kii script acchhee he, lekin item song or gaanon se bachaa ja saktaa tha, kyonki ye film kii gati ko dhimaa kar dete hai
 
 
 The story of the film keeps you hooked and the many twists of the story startle you
 
 
 nirdeshak ke rup main jayadeep or mukhya bhoomika main sumit ko apane kirdaar ke graph par thodaa or kaam karnaa chahie tha
 
 
 Overall 'mazi' is an entertaining thriller, which also gives a good message
 
 
 meri ore se 'maazi' kii reating he - 3 star

 Mona Vasu's acting is good
 
 
 sumit nizaavan kii acting se zyada lekhak ke taur par unki tarif karnaa chaahunga
 
 
 He needs to work on himself as an actor right now, but his good thing is that he does not do over-acting anywhere in the entire film
 
 
 pankaj treepathi, zakir hossain, jishaan or maanav kowshik bhi apane abhinay se chhap chhodte hai
 
 
 The script of the film is good, but the item songs and songs could have been avoided, as they slow down the pace of the film
 
 
 film kii kahani aapako baandhe rakhti he or kahani ke kai mode aapako chaunkaa dete hai
 
 
 Jaideep as the director and Sumit in the lead role should have worked a bit more on the graph of his character
 
 
 kul milakar 'maazi' ek manoranjak thriller he, jo ek acha sandesh bhi detii he
 
 
 i have a rating of 'mazi' - 3 stars

 Rahul said, 50 per cent of the people of our country are women and if you ask any of them if they feel comfortable traveling in the bus, or whether they can walk comfortably outside or are comfortable with them in India If behavior happens, every woman's answer will be that they do not feel safe
 ladakon ko abhadra vyavhaar nahin karnaa chahiegandhi ne kaha, or ladakon ko is bare main sochna chahie

 isse pehle sundaram nyaayalay se sajaa tay karne ke liye ek bahya ayog gathit karne kii maang kar chuke hai, taaki faisla paardarshee ho sake
 a bench of Justices TS Thakur and Justice Fakir Mohammad Ibrahim Kalifulla said, "the Mudgal committee should be asked to take action on this and a rational suggestion of the matter
" jurmaana lagaae jane kaa adhikaar bhi unhen hi diya jaae
 " nyaayalay ne kaha, "ab chunki report aa chuki he to ham bisisiai se 10 dinon ke andar koi nirnay lene ke liye kah sakate hai
 " sundaram ne nyaayalay ko bataaya, "bisisiai ko unke saamne sunwaayee kaa avasar diya jaae
 " is par nyaayalay ne kaha ki mudgal samiti kii report nyaayalay ko mil chuki he or sunwaayee kaa charan samaapt ho chukaa he
 The court said, "why are you not taking action? Why should we take action? We will only check the compatibility of the action taken
" ham aapako us par apil karne kaa avasar denge
 " nyaayalay ne kaha ki agar mudgal samiti kii report par nyaayalay karrwai karata he to yah bisisiai ke adhikaron kaa hanan hoga
 The court also said that the court was against the determination of punitive action against Meiyappan by the current BCCI officials and others on the Mudgal Committee report
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki maujuuda bisisiai samiti ke adhikaar samaapt ho chuke hai, kyonki iskaa kaarykaal kaaphi pehle khatm ho chukaa he
 The court said, "all people involved in the case should be kept away from it
" bisisiai main nae sire se chunaav hone chahie or bisisiai main puri tarah nae chehron ko laana chahie jo mudgal samiti kii report par karrwai kar sake
 " nyaayalay ke is nirnay se shrinivasana kii chauthe kaarykaal ke liye bisisiai adhyaksh pad ke chunaav main khadey hone kii sambhaavnaaon ko bada jhatka laga he
 Sundaram told the court on this, "the court should set up an external commission and take a decision on the case so that no one can object to the decision
" " Supporting the court's decision to exclude all those involved in the case, advocate Nalini Chidambaram, appearing for the petitioner Bihar Cricket Association, said Srinivas should be kept out of the BCCI
 chidambaram ne kaha, "saidhantik taur par shrinivasana ko bisisiai ke agle chunaav main khadaa nahin hona chahie
 " chidambaram ne kaha ki sachai, eemaandaaree or saarvajanik niti jaise bade pariprekshya main dekha jaae to sattebaaji se judi jaankaree rahane ke baavjood koi karrwai na karne ke kaaran shrinivasana bisisiai kii bhrashtachar rodhi parichaalan niyamon ke daayre main bhi aa jate hai

 bhartiya nirvachan ayog (EC) ne shuja ke is daawey kaa purajor khandan kiya or kaha ki bharat kii iviem bilkul surakshit he
 The commission has said that Shuja's allegations are being investigated and legal action is also being considered on them
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab bharat kii electronic voting mashin par dosha madha gaya
 However, this was the first time out of the country when it was informed at a press conference that EVM tampering is easy and has been happening before

 The BJP called it a conspiracy and said that the Congress keeps its 'freelancers' always ready, even in Pakistan people are sent against the Modi government
 kendriya mantri or bijepi netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne landan main yojit press conference main kapil sibbal kii maujuudagi par yahaan tak kah daalaa ki unhen sonia or rahul gandhi ne bheja he
 The incident of the past was a new episode in many episodes when the Election Commission once again faced 'questions' but the EC has always claimed that EVM is foolproof and no one can compromise its security
 ayog ne yah bhi chunauti di he ki koi aage aae or iviem tempring karke dikhaae
 There were one or two occasions when leaders and parties raised evms in the box but the result was zero

 2009 main unke ek bayaan ne bhuuchaal machaa diya ki chunaav ayog jab tak iviem kii suraksha kii puri guarantee nahin letaa, desh main ballat paper se hi chunaav karaae jane chahie
 He demanded ballot paper voting in Maharashtra and three other states
 yah pehla mauka tha jab kisi party ke varisht netaa ne iviem ke khilaaf khulkar bayaan diya
 At that time Advani was the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 congress sarkaar main thi isliye uskaa tark lajimi tha jaisaa tark aaj bijepi detii he
 The Congress rejected Advani's allegations and agreed to the EVM elections
 adwani ke aaropon ke baad bhi iviem apni pariksha main kaamyaab rahi or 2014 kaa chunaav nishpaksh dhang se sampann karaayaa gaya
 Interestingly, after the 2009 allegations, the BJP came to power with a thumping majority in 2014 and recorded a record in history
 uske baad bijepi ne is aarope se pallaa jhaada or aaj haalat yah he ki adwani ne us vakt jo aarope lagaaya tha, congress aaj unheen baton par bijepi ko gher rahi he
 However, EVM stood firmly in this tutu-i of bjp-congress and even today, people's trust remains on it
 madhya pradesh chunaav or congreshaal main madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav sampann hue or congress ne vijay hasil kii
 After the polling was over, the senior Congress leader of the state alleged that evms were placed suddenly in the strong room where electricity was installed

 The incident is of Bhopal jail
 bhopal ke colector ne apni report main bataaya ki 30 november ko sava aath baje se saadhe nau baje tak bijli gai thi or is dauraan sisitivi kii recording darj nahin hui
 However, on this charge of tampering, the Election Commission came forward and gave all the information about the alternative system
 matdaan hue or rigelt congress ke paksh main aayaa
 Interestingly, after the Congress victory, the allegations of tampering of evms were lost somewhere and now they are not even heard
 AAP ne bhi liya EVM kaa testsupi main vidhansabha chunaav hue lagbhag do saal ho gaye
 In that election, the BJP won by a large number of seats and almost all the parties got sidelined in a few seats
 iskaa sabase zyada thikra iviem par phuta or isamen sabase aage rahi aam aadmi party
 Arvind Kejriwal, the convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party, considered it a personal battle and went against the Commission
 kejariwal kaa aarope isliye bhi tha kyonki unki party punjab or goa main buree tarah haar gai thi
 Kejriwal made a very strong comment against the Election Commission and called it an agent of BJP
 unka kahana tha ayog bijepi ke liye kaam karata he
 However, on these allegations, the commission only said that EVM is foolproof and Election Commission does its work honestly
 dilachasp vakya yah bhi rahaa ki kejariwal ke ek vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj khuleam yah elaan karte or demo dete dikhe ki iviem ko kaise hack kar sakate hai
 However, the Commission accepted the challenge and invited the parties who claimed to be hacked
 nateeja yah rahaa ki kisi bhi party ne ayog kaa nyotaa sweekaar nahin kiya
 a person has been detained from outside the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi, where Pakistan's National Day is being observed on Friday
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vah shaks andar jane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 However, no Hurriyat leader is present in the Pakistani High Commission
 dilli sthit pakistani ucchayog dwaara rashtriya diwas samaaroh main vishesh rup se jammu or kashmir ke kai algaavvaadi netaaon ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 However, the Indian Foreign Ministry had decided not to send an official representative to Pakistan's National Day celebrations
 bhartiya ucchayukta ne press conference kar is baat kii jaankaree di
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said on Friday that India has decided not to send any representative to attend the Pakistan National Day celebrations today
 unhone kaha ki islamabad main yojit aise kaaryakramon main bhi koi bhartiya pratinidhi shaamil nahin hoga
 The Ministry of External Affairs took this decision due to the invitation of Kashmiri separatist leaders by the Pakistan High Commission
 pichley kuch varshon main aise kaaryakramon main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv kendriya mantri str kaa rahaa he
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said, "india has decided not to send any delegates to the Pakistan National Day celebrations to be held today
 pakistani ucchayog ne hurriyat conference ke pratinidhiyon ko samaaroh main aamantrit karne kaa nirnay liya or iske baad bharat ne yah faisla kiya
 Kumar said in a media briefing that India has a clear view that any attempt by the Pakistani High Commission or the Pakistani leadership to negotiate with the Hurriyat Conference will not be taken lightly
 bharat jammu kashmir ke algaavvaadi netaaon ke saath pakistan ke baatcheet karne kaa tikhaa virodh karata rahaa he
 Kumar replied to a question, 'our High Commission in Islamabad will also not attend the ceremony there
 ’darasal, pakistan kii taraf se hurriyat netaaon ko apane rashtriya diwas ke aayojan nen bulaanaa is baat kii ore ishaara karata he ki pakistan abhi bhi bharat ke aantarik maamalon main dakhsandaji kii koshish main he
 In such a situation, India has once again made its stand clear in a gesture to Pakistan by deciding not to send any of its official representatives to this event of Pakistan's National Day
 jaankaree ke mutabik bharat ne pichley saptaah hi pakistan ucchayog ko is baat kii jaankaree de di thi ki agar pakistan kii taraf se hurriyat netaaon ko aamantrit kiya jaataa he to vah samaaroh main apana koi pratinidhi nahin bhejega
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar said that India is boycotting the programs because of invitations to Hurriyat leaders and not for any other reason
 bataa den ki 2018 main pakistan ke is samaaroh main krishi rajya mantri gajendra singh shekhavat ne bhaag liya tha
 Not this, many separatist leaders of Kashmir also participated in this program
 bataa den ki lahore prastaav ke maukey par har varsh 23 march ko pakistan diwas manaaya jaataa he
 But this year, Pakistan High Commission in Delhi has decided to celebrate it a day before i

 ek vakt tha 26 saal kii umr main england ke eliester cook ko test maichon main sachin ke shatakon ke record ke liye khatra mana ja rahaa tha, magar phir andu strans ne ritairement le lee or cook ko captaini kaa chaska lag gaya
 In the midst of controversies, Kevin Pietersen's exit meant that the captain's crown in odis also fell on Cook's head and the player's downfall began
 phir to siries-dar-siries test maichon main england hit or vanade main flop sabit hone lagi
 In Test cricket, the importance of captaincy is more mental than technique and the anderson-bord duo managed to win Cook, but in odis Cook was seen failing as a captain and as a batsman

 The patience of the selectors broke down and Cook was quickly shown the way out of the team
 world cap se thik pehle england kaa yah faisla kaiyon ko chaunkaa saktaa he, magar yah sahi faisla he
 This would give England two advantages
 vanade main ab elex helles team kii pari kii shuruyaat karenge or morgan ke netritv main team nae utsaah ke saath maidan par utregi
 At the same time, Cook does not have to be disheartened and should assume that not everyone is a hit in every format
 vah test ke behtareen khilaadi hai or safed kapado main hi unhen ab khel ke vibhinn rang khojane honge

 The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is exploring the possibility of mining helium-3 at the southern tip of the moon to meet energy needs
 duniyabar ke nijee or kai saarvajanik antariksh sanghathan bhi chand par khanan ke lekar dilchaspee dikhaa rahe hai, jo ek upyukt riector banane tak helium-3 or chand par maujuud pani ke bhandaaran ke liye khanan sambadhi sambhaavna talash rahe hai
 In the search for helium-3, India will lead the Dr
 ISRO Chairman and Secretary of the Department of Space
 sivan kaa kahana he ki jis kisi bhi desh main chand se is strot ko laane kii kshamta hogi ve hi is prakriya par apana varchasv kaayam rakh sakenge
 He said, 'we want India not only to be a part of this process but also to lead it, we are fully prepared for this mission
 isro oktober main ek rover or jaanch (prob) mishan launch karegaa jo chand kii achhuti sataha par mitti or pani ke namoonon ko ekatra karegaa, phir ise vistrut vishleshan or anusandhan ke liye waapas laayaa jayega
 'this mission of India is quite economical with a similar operation by the American Space Agency NASA which will cost about 800 crores
 ise padhein: nevigation satellites ke liye ISRO ne banaai ye khaas ghadi250 saalon tak jarurat puri karne kii kshamtanasa ke salaahkaar mandal ke sadsy gerald kusinski kii maane to chand par 10 lakh mitric ton helium-3 uplabdh he, jiskaa ek chauthai hissaa dharti par laayaa ja saktaa he
 This isotope of helium, full of unlimited nuclear energy, is available on Earth in limited quantities because it is emitted by the Sun into its solar air
 unka kahana he ki hamaara chumbakeey kshetra ise prithvi kii sataha tak pahunchane se roktaa he
 The moon has no such shield, which is why its surface is believed to absorb helium-3 for months
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki chand par helium-3 itani prachur maatra main he ki isse 250 saalon tak vaishvik urja jaruraton ko puraa kiya ja saktaa he
 What is Helium-3? Helium-3 on the moon was confirmed by noted geologist Harrison Schmidt in 1972 after his return from the moon from the Apollo 17 mission
 helium-3 nabhakeey sanlayan ke liye ek moolyawaan or swachhtar eendhan he jise dharti par praapt nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 However, if helium-3 can be mined adequately and transported at affordable rates, this fusion can also be an attractive option

 vah philhal 'mere sai' sho main tulasa kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai
 In this show, his character is shown a loyal devotee of Sai Baba
 bataa den sneha apni pehali shaadi main gharelu hinsa kaa shikaar huin thi
 After this, in 2015, she was married to businessman Anurag Solanki
 lekin duusari shaadi ke aath maheenon main hi donon main manmutav hone laga or ab donon kareeb ek saal se ek duusare se alag rah rahe hai
 First the inflammatory speech and then the threat
 taaja khabar he ki maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke adhyaksh raaj thakare ne toll tex maamle se jude maharashtra sarkaar kii jaanch ke aadesh ko chunauti dete hue dhamkee di he ki rajya sarkaar unke khilaaf chaahe jo kar le, wo vahi karenge ki jo unki ichha hogi
 a few days ago, Raj Thackeray gave a provocative speech in Navi Mumbai and appealed to his workers to stop paying toll tax on toll points now
 iske baad se hi maharashtra ke kai toll naakon par emenes ke kaaryakartaaon ne jamkar todphod machaai thi
 After this, the state government has ordered an inquiry into Raj Thackeray's speech
 lekin phir se raaj thakare ye kah rahe hai ki sarkaar chaahe jo kar le wo apni manamaani jari rakhenge
 a case was filed against Raj Thackeray on Tuesday for allegedly inciting violence and endangering the peace against party chief Raj Thackeray following the vandalism by MNS activists at various toll plazas across the state
 raaj thakare ne somvaar ko hi apane samarthakon ko farmaan jari kiya tha ki vah toll tex naa den or is farmaan ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane waalon ke saath marpet karen
 Following this statement, activists of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena vandalized several toll booths in the state
 pune-satara road par khed-shivpur main somvaar raat toll plaza ko kshatigrast karne ke maamle main bhor taluka ke rajgad police thane main thakare ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he
 It has been more than a year since the ban on demonetisation, but the big cash mafia is still trying to settle the 500 and 1000 ruined notes
 wo bhi or kahin nahin centre sarkaar kii naak ke thik neeche yani desh kii rajdhani dilli main
 The investigation of India Today's Special Investigation Team has exposed this fraud
 bataa den ki notebandi kaa ek saal puraa hone se thik ek din pehle rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ne dilli main 36 karod rupee ke avaidh qaraar ho chuke note jabt kiye the
 It is suspected that they were to be used for funding anti-india activities
 is silsile main 9 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 India Today under-cover reporters found out from their investigation that large cash mafia can still be involved in the illegal business of converting illegal notes into legitimate notes
 isi jaanch ke dauraan kuch aise sandigdh agents ko chhipe hue camere main kaid kiya gaya jauvaidh karenciko uske asli mulya ke 12 se 25 fisadi ke badale lene ko taiyaar dikhe
 That is, if 500 and 1000 rupees of old closed notes of one lakh rupees are given, then new valid notes of 12 to 25 thousand rupees will be found in its place
 jaahir he ki ye daawa kuch bank karmchaariyon se sathganth hone ke bina nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Cash carrier Shivanand was imprisoned in Sarita Vihar in south-west Delhi by an under-cover reporter in a secret camera claiming that he could convert the demonetised notes of up to Rs 200 crore into valid notes
 shivanand ne pikup or delivery kii seva tak kii peshkash kii
 Shivanand told the under cover reporter to take two with one hand and with the other hand
 ye aapaki jagah se hi uthaa lee jaaegi
 Shivanand said that our person will go to your house and check the money (closed currency)
 iske baad wo phone karegaa or ek vine vahaan pahonchegi
 This will be a 'hand to hand' transaction
 adla badali kii keemat puche jane par shivanand ne kaha ki avaidh karency kitni he, rate uske hisaab se pehle se tay hai
 If an illegal currency of 25 crores rupees is to be changed, then it will get valid notes equal to 25 per cent of its real value
 agar 5 karod rupee kii avaidh karency tabdeel kerani he to uske badale 12 fisadi vaid note milenge
 About 12–13 per cent for 5 crores and 25 per cent for 25 (crores)
 india today jaanch ke tahat phir shivanand gang ke hi do sadasyon sohail or fahim tak pahunchaa gaya
 He was captured in a hidden camera at Kisan Ghat in central Delhi
 donon ne jor diya ki avaidh ho chuki karency ko check karne, lene or tabdeel karne kaa kaam or koi nahin bank adhikari hi karegaa
 Faheem told the under cover reporter that see our man will come from the bank
 wo apni pahchaan sabit karegaa
 We will come later with our consignment
 wo (bank adhikari) aapkaa cash check karegaa
 India Today's under cover reporter then proceeded to her workplace to reach the suspect officer
 ye jagah dilli ke okhla ilaake main ek sheersh public sector bank kii shakha thi
 There, the staff named Sanjay not only made deals for exchange of currency but also revealed that the big cash mafia in Delhi is collecting illegal currency from black money hoarders
 sanjay ko chupe camere main ye kehete kaid kiya gaya ki wo ek dukaan se oparate karte hai
 They collect the old currency that has been closed
 unhone bade pikup ke target tay kar rakhaa he
 Sanjay said from his desk, recently Shivanand got 2 from a doctor
 37 lakh rupee ke band ho chuke note liye
 i took them for replacement at 10% of this price
 ye sab bazaar main ho rahaa he

 Search engine Google has today honored Rukhmabai Raut, India's first female doctor, through Doodle
 google ne apane doodle main rukhmabai kii ek tasviir lagaai he or saath hi main ek aspataal kii tasviir bhi he, jisamen marij or mahila doctor dikhaai de rahe hai
 Rukhmabai Raut was born on 22 November 1864
 unki shaadi mahaj 11 varsh kii umr main 'dadaji bhikaaji' (19) se ho gai thi
 Who was Rukhmabai Raut? Rukhmabai Raut was one of the earliest practicing doctors in British India
 rukhmabai ne us vakt saraahneey kaary kiye the, jab mahilaon ko vishesh adhikaron se vanchit rakhaa jaataa tha
 During that time she fought a case against her husband opposing her marriage for her rights
 aisi shakhsiyat jisane puraa jivan laga diya maanav seva manjayantibai or janardan pandurang kii beti rukhmabai ne aath saal kii umr main apane pita ko kho diya tha or unki 11 saal kii umr main shaadi ho gai thi
 However, even after marriage, she lived with her mother
 saat saal baat unke pati ne patni ko apane saath rakhane ke liye court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha, lekin rukhmabai ne jane se manaa kar diya
 Her family members supported her and fought the case in court, but Dadadi won the case and was ordered to accompany her husband
 rukhmabai ne apane tarkon se, 1880 ke dashak main press ke madhyam se logon ko is par dhyaan dene par vivash kar diya
 Thus came the case of many social reformers including Ramabai Ranade and Behramji Malabari
 jaaniye safalataa kaa paracham fahraane vaali in bhartiya mahilaon ke bare menis maamle ke baad rukhmabai ne doctor ke rup main prashikshin liya, jiske baad unhone is jagat main 35 saal tak kaam kiya, vah apni doctorl main safal hone ke baad rukeen nahin iske baad vah bal vivaah ke khilaaf likh kar samaaj sudhaarak kaa kaary bhi karti raheen
 On 29 September 2016, a video of the surgical strike by the Indian Army penetrated into the Pakistani border has now surfaced
 is video main saaf taur se dikh rahaa he ki kis tarah bhartiya sena karrwai kar rahi he
 Let me tell you, since the surgical strike, these questions were being raised whether the Indian Army has crossed the loc for the first time and carried out the surgical strike? Has the Indian Army never done this before? In such a situation, some claims were made that earlier such operations have been done by the Indian Army, but their information was never made public
 'india today / aaj tak' nesargical strixke ateet kii tah ko khangaalane kii koshish kii
 The result of this is shocking
 beete 19 saal main kam se kam 9 baar bhartiya sena ne elosi ke paar jaakar oparations ko anjaam diya or pakistani sena ko sabak sikhaaya
 In this period, the first incident of crossing the loc from the Indian Army occurred in May 1998
 vahiin 29 sitambar ke haalia sargical strike se pehle aakhri baar agast 2013 main bhartiya sena ne elosi ko paar kiya tha
 In between these two incidents also, in the summer of 1999, January 2000, March 2000, September 2003, June 2008, August 2011 and January 2013, the Indian Army crossed the loc for operations 7 times
 may, 1998 se agast 2013 ke bich bhartiya sena ne elosi cross kar jo 9 oparation anjaam die, unke bare main bhartiya sarkaar ne naa to kabhi saarvajanik taur par sweekaar kiya or naa hi kabhi ye jaankaree di ki in oparations ko anjaam dete vakt elosi ke donon taraf kitna nuksaan hua
 'india Today / Aaj Tak' cross-checked the media reports of the last two decades, apart from talking to the country's highly placed intelligence sources and retired army officers
 isi ke aadhaar par aap tak pahunch rahaa he bhartiya sena ke purv main elosi paar kar kiye gaye 9 oparations kaa byoraa
 1
 may 1998pakistan ne khud bhartiya sena ke is oparation kii sanyukt raashtra se 1998 main shikaayat kii
 This complaint is registered on page 321 of the United Nations Annual Book 1998
 iske mutabik pakistan ne 4 may ko shikaayat main kaha ki pioke main elosi ke 600 meter paar bandala seri main 22 logon ko maar daalaa gaya
 Quoting some eyewitnesses present in the village of Pakistan, it was also told, 'about a dozen people came in midnight in black clothes
 unhone kuch parche bhi chode jis par ek main likhaa tha- 'badla brigade'
 On the other leaflet, it was written - 'bad result of bad work
 ' ek or parche par likhaa tha- ek aankh ke badale 10 ankhen, ek daant ke badale puraa jabaada
 'when Pakistan raised a finger on the Indian government for this attack, New Delhi refused to take responsibility
 haalanki us vakt kuch america adhikariyon kii ore se mana gaya tha ki ye karrwai pathankot or dhakikot ke gaavon main 26 bhartiya nagarikon kii hatya ke badale main kii gai thi
 2
 greeshmakaal 19991999 kii garmiyon main kargil yuddh ke dauraan bhartiya sena kii tukdi jammu ke paas munaavar tavi nadi se elosi ko cross kiya tha
 In this operation an entire Pakistan outpost was blown up
 usee ghatana ke baad pakistan ne border ection team (BAT) kaa gathan kiya tha
 It included commandos of Pakistan's Special Service Group (SAG)
 janvari main ek bhartiya sainik kaa sir kalam kar dene ke liye BAT ko hi jimmedaar mana jaataa he

 janvari 2000kargil yuddh ke 6 maheene baad 21-22 janvari 2000 ko neelam nadi ke paar nadala enklev main ek post par red ke dauraan 7 pakistani sainikon ko kathith taur par pakade jane kaa daawa kiya gaya tha
 According to Pakistan, these seven soldiers were injured in the firing of Indian soldiers
 baad main in sainikon ke shavon ko pakistan ko waapas kar diya gaya tha
 According to the report of the newspaper 'the Hindu', a senior officer of the Pakistani DGMO had said that Pakistan did not deliberately inflame the incident
 is adhikari ke mutabik general musharraf ko takhtapalat kiye kuch hi din hue the or wo nahin chaahate the ki is par logon main zyada shor mache or bharat ke saath phir sankat utpann ho
 Sources in the Indian Army said that this action was taken on behalf of the Indian Army after the martyrdom of Captain Saurabh Kalia and five soldiers of the 4 Jat Regiment - soldiers Bhanwar Lal Bagriya, Arjun Ram, Bhikha Ram, Moola Ram and Naresh Singh
 4
 March 2000 Sources say that after the Kargil war, Captain Gurjinder Singh of the deployed 12 Bihar Battalion crossed the loc with a team of infantry battalion commandos (lethal) and attacked the Pakistani post
 ye pakistani sena ke purv main kiye gaye hamale kii javaabi karrwai thi
 Captain Suri was martyred in this operation of India
 unhen maranoparant mahavir chakra se sammanit kiya gaya
 Meanwhile, on 2 March 2000, lashkar-e-taiba militants killed 35 Sikhs in an attack
 tab atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar kii ore se 9 para (special forcej) ko sarhad paar kar karrwai kii anumati di gai thi
 After this, Indian soldiers led by the Special Forces Major crossed the loc and carried out the work of 28 Pakistani soldiers and terrorists
 5
 Since the ceasefire was implemented on the loc in September 20032003 in both countries, little information is available about the operation going on the land of the other
 lekin pakistan kii ore se elosi par nigaraanee vaale sanyukt raashtra preshak dal (UNMOGIP) ko darj shikayaton se pataa chalata he ki cross border oparations badastoor jari rahe
 Pakistan claimed in a complaint that Indian soldiers attacked a post on 18 September 2003 in the Baroh sector near Poon's Bhimbar Gali
 is ghatana main pakistani jesio samet 4 jawan maare gaye
 6
 june 20082008 main bhi kam se kam do baar aisi ghatnaayen huin
 This was the year when incidents of collision on the loc started increasing
 pakistan kii shikayaton ke record ke mutabik poonch ke bhattal sector main 19 june 2008 ko bhartiya sainikon kii karrwai main chaar pakistani jawan maare gaye
 Earlier on 5 June 2008, there was an attack on Kranti Border Surveillance Post in Salhotri village of Poona, in which Javaswar Chavar, a soldier of 2-8 Gurkha Regiment, was killed
 7
 August 2011 On 30 August 2011, Pakistan lodged a complaint that four of its soldiers, including one of its jcos, were killed in action by the Indian Army near the Neelum River Valley in Kell
 akhbaar 'da hindu' ne is ghatana par sutron ke hawaale se bataaya tha ki ye oparation karnah me bhartiya javaanon par hamale main do bhartiya sainikon kii hatya or unke shavon ko kshatvikshat kiye jane ke badale main kiya gaya tha
 8
 janvari 2013'da hindu' kii ek report main 6 janvari 2013 kii ek ghatana kaa is tarah zikr he
 After the cross border firing on the night of 6 January 2013, 19 Infantry Division Commander Gulab Singh Rawat sought permission to attack the Pakistani post
 is pakistani post se bhartiya sainikon ko nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa tha
 Pakistan was again told that its posts in Sawan Patra were attacked by Indian soldiers
 haalanki bharat ne pakistan ke is daawey kaa us vakt khandan kiya
 Jagdish Dahiya, the then spokesman of the Indian Army, said- 'none of our soldiers crossed the loc
 'is ghatana par ek varisht adhikari ne dilli main kaha, 'ise is tarah dekha janaa chahie
 There was no formal permission to cross the loc to target Sawan Patra
 lekin tanaav kii garmi main is tarah kii chijen hoti rahati hai

 a series of meetings were held between top BCCI officials to discuss the entire controversy in which the entire controversy was discussed and a strategy was devised to find an appropriate way to deal with Modi
 bisisiai adhyaksh shashaank manohar ne purv board pramukh sharad pavaar ke saath baithak kii or unhen sanchaalan parishad ke anya sadasyon ke najariye ke bare main bataaya
 Modi is considered close to Pawar
 bisisiai ke ek chotii ke sutara ne sanket diya ki modi ko mumbai main sanchaalan parishad kii baithak main pad chhodane ko kaha ja saktaa he or pavaar ne bhi is kadam ke liye apni rajamandi de di he
 The source said, "it is in the interest of IPL and BCCI to resign from their posts
 lekin agar vah aisa nahin karte to sanchaalan parishad ko unhen hataane ke liye unke khilaaf prastaav paas karne ko baadhya hona pad saktaa he
 The source said, "there has been almost unanimity on the board that Modi has to go
" unke paas koi vikalp nahin he
 This is the only logical conclusion
 ’bisisiai ke aalaa adhikariyon kaa maananaa he ki kai aaropon ke saath modi kii sthiti asthir ho gai he or unako baahar kiye jane ke baad hi ‘saaf suthra’ karne kii prakriya shuru ho sakati he
 The number of Modi's supporters inside the board is also steadily decreasing and it will not be easy for them to get out of the crisis this time
 modi par shikanja kasne or is mudde ke raajnneetik rang lene ke baad is tarah kii atakalein bhi hai ki pavaar apane rutabe kaa istemaal karke modi ko pad chhodane ke liye manaa sakate hai
 Though the conversation between Manohar and Pawar has not been officially known, but after the statement that a 'unanimous and collective' decision will be taken, it is believed to be a bad sign for Modi
 manohar ke saath baithak se pehle pavaar ne kendriya vitt mantri pranab mukherjee or grih mantri pi chidambaram ke saath bhi mulaakaat kii
 Manohar then met Rajiv Shukla, chairman of the media and finance committee, and Arun Jaitley, the DDCA president and senior BJP leader, and discussed the issue
 bisisiai is mudde ko jald se jald sulajhane ke paksh main he lekin kaaphi kuch is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki modi kya rukh apanaate hai or khud kaa bachaav kaise karte hai
 The source said, "if Modi insists, then the matter will go to a special meeting of the General Assembly where voting can be held on it
" ’ iske alaava bisisiai main yah prastaav bhi he ki modi kii kathith vittiya aniyamittaaon kii jaanch ke liye samiti banaai jaae lekin kuch sadsy iske paksh main nahin he kyonki sarkaar pehle hi ipel ke sabhi pakshon kii jaanch kaa faisla kar chuki he

 The earthquake felt in Jammu and Kashmir was felt due to an earthquake in the hills of Hindukush in Afghanistan
 is bukamp kaa centre bharat main nahin balki afghanistan main he lekin isaki gaharaai 180 kilometre hone kii vajah se dur-dur tak isaki dhamak mahasoos kii gai
 However, the intensity of earthquake in Afghanistan is only 5
 5 thi or isko khatarnaak bukamp kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 But the stir in the hills of Hindukush is increasing the beating of people all over the country
 kyonki bharat kaa ek bada hissaa bukamp ke lihaaj se kaaphi samvedansheel he
 North India and most of Northeast India are considered very dangerous in case of earthquake
 yahaan par bukamp aane kii vajah himalay he
 Geological movements in the Himalayas are a major cause of earthquakes
 plate tectonic kii theory ke mutabik himalay ke kshetra main bhartiya plate or urasian plate ke bich takaraav chal rahaa he
 The Indian plate is penetrating below the Eurasian plate and because of this, earthquakes keep happening in this area
 himalay ke oonche-oonche pahaad isi takkar kaa nateeja he
 The Indian plate typically penetrates below the 40 to 50 mm Eurasian plate every year
 is vajah se himalay bukamp ke lihaaj se duniya bhar ke sabase sakriy ilaakon main se ek he
 The collision of the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate is the area of the Indus and Brahmaputra rivers
 in donon nadiyon ke dakshin main sthit himalay kii oonchin chotiyaan hameshaa hi bukamp se hilti rahi hai
 Because of this, large earthquakes have occurred in North India
 - 1905 main 7
 a major earthquake of magnitude 5 struck Kangra, killing thousands of people and causing considerable destruction
 - 1934 main bihar main 8
 a devastating earthquake of magnitude 1 occurred

 - 7 in Kashmir in 2005
 6 kii tivrata kaa bada bukamp aayaa jisamen hajaaron logon ko jaan se haath dhonaa padaa tha
 These earthquakes are just a hallmark
 is tarah ke vinaashkari bukamp himalay ko hilaate rahe hai
 It is said that there has been a stir in the entire Himalayas
 aise main vinaashkari bukamp kaa khatre se koi inkaar nahin saktaa he
 There is no place in India that is earthquake safe
 vaigyanikon ne puure desh ko bukamp ke lihaaj se chaar shreniyon main baant rakhaa he
 Many areas of the country including Delhi and NCR fall in earthquake-prone areas
 sismik jone 5, yani bukamp ke lihaaj se sabase khatarnaak ilaaka
 Zone five means earthquakes of more than eight magnitude can occur here
 is jone main desh kaa puraa north east ilaaka, jammu-kashmir, himachal pradesh or uttaranchal ke ilaake, gujarat kaa kuccha, uttar bihar or andaman nicobar dweep aata he
 It is also considered very dangerous in terms of seismic zone 4 earthquake
 yahaan 7 se 7
 Up to 9 earthquakes can occur
 is jone main rajdhani dilli, ensiaar ke ilaake, jammu kashmir or himachal pradesh ke ilaake, sikkim, upi, bihar or pashchim bengal kaa uttari ilaaka, gujarat kaa kuch hissaa or pashchim tat se sata maharashtra or rajasthan kaa ilaaka aata he
 Zone 3 is considered moderately earthquake prone
 is jone main kerala, goa, lakshadeep, upi, gujarat or pashchim bengal ke bache hue ilaake, punjab, rasthaan, madhya pradesh, bihar, jharkhand chhattisgarh, maharashtra, orissa, andhra pradesh, tamilnadu or karnataka ke ilaake aate hai
 The rest of the country falls in Seismic Zone 2
 ye bukamp ke lihaaj se kam khatarnaak he
 4 here 9 tivrata se zyada kaa bukamp aane kaa khatra nahin
 That is, no part of the country is safe in terms of earthquake
 lihaaja bukamp ke khatre ko halke main lenaa budhimaani nahin hogi

 com / gj1evkhhqc The government and the opposition have been face to face over the last few months on the Rafale aircraft deal
 ek ore jahaan vipaksh ise chunaav main mudda banaakar bhunaane kii koshishon main laga he, vahiin sarkaar rafel ke aaropon se inkaar kar rahi he
 But now a new thing has come out about Rafael under Right to Information
 niyantrak evam mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) ne vivaadit rafel vimaan qaraar ke apane ankekshan kaa byoraa dene se inkaar kar diya he
 The CAG said that the process of audit of the Rafale agreement is not yet complete and any disclosure will violate the privilege of Parliament
 pune main rahane vaale kaaryakarta vihaar durve kii ore se soochna kaa adhikaar (artiai) kanoon ke tahat daayar ek arji par apane jawaab main sieji ne yah jaankaree di
 The country's auditor said, "audit is progressing and the report has not been finalized yet
" yah soochna artiai kanoon kii dhara 8(1)(si) ke tahat nahin di ja sakati, kyonki aisa karnaa sansad ke visheshadhikaar kaa hanan hoga
 Last month, the Supreme Court rejected the applications challenging the agreement between India and France for the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha tha ki is maamle main faisla lene kii prakriya par andeh karne kii koi vajah nahin he
 Actually, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is continuously accusing PM Modi of scam in Rafael
 rahul gandhi sansad se lekar reliyon main lagaataar modi sarkaar ko rafel par gherte najar aate rahe hai
 In the winter session of Parliament, Rahul challenged PM Modi to debate on Rafael for 20 minutes

 Before the assembly elections in October this year in Haryana, Chautala's younger son Abhay Chautala was welcoming the four-time Congress MP Avtar Singh Bhadana to the party with his arms extended
 or bhadana bhi bhadaas nikaalane main nahin chukeh “haryana main congress nahin, hooda congress kaa raaj he
 Hooda is blackmailing Sonia Gandhi over Robert Vadra's land scams
 saare swabhimani congressi party chhod rahe hai
 "the next day, a bungalow on the Pandit Pant Marg bungalow of Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, barely two km from this bungalow, was seen
" safed pajama-kurta yaa pant-kameez main oonche puure kad ke log apane samarthakon ke saath tikat kii aas main bangale ke ahaate main deraa jamaaye the
 And the dismembered leader Hooda was reassuring him
 ye donon bangale siyasat kii do vipareet dhuree hote hue bhi ek samanta rakhte hai—vah he jat raajnneeti par kabja
 The Chautala family of Sirsa and the Hooda family of Rohtak belong to the Jat caste which has given 13 of the 20 Chief Ministers of Haryana
 or ho bhi kyon na, aakhir yahaan ke 1
 About 24% of the 200 million voters are from the Jat community
 isiilie yahaan raajnneeti kaa sameekaran mote taur par jat or gaiyr-jat kii dhuree par ghumta he
 That is why the third and new strength of the BJP is that the Jat leaders of the Congress who come to it will cut the votes of the Jats and the rest of the Jat votes will be divided in the Congress and Chaitala
 aise main gaiyr-jat voter party ke liye pehali baar apane dam par sarkaar banane kaa rasta banaaenge
 BJP in-charge of Haryana Jagdish Mukhi does not forget to say that till now more than 100 people from other parties like Congress and INLD have joined the party
 ve kehete hai, “hamaare saath choudhary birendra singh jaise varisht netaa, rajya ke 9 purv mantri, 11 purv vidhayak or vipakshi partiyon ke bade padaadhikari aae hai
 "this achievement matters
 khaskar tab jab taaoo devilal kaa chautaala parivaar yahaan vishuddh rup se jat raajnneeti kaa centre rahaa ho
 At the same time, Congress's Hooda has made himself stand on the jat-dalit alliance
 udhar vaisya samudaay se taalluk rakhane vaale divangat bhajanlaal ke bete kuldeep bishnoi kii party haryana janhit congress puri tarah gaiyr-jat voton ko lamaband karne kii pahal par bani thi
 Although Kuldeep could not implement this equation, but in the last Lok Sabha election, the Bharatiya Janata Party did it
 in banate-bigadate samikarnon ke bich congress main gafalat kaa maahaul he
 Rao Inderjit Singh, once a veteran state Congress leader, switched sides to BJP before the Lok Sabha elections and is a Minister of State in the Central Government after becoming an MP from Gurgaon
 congress mahasachiv rahe choudhary birendra singh ne bhi vidhansabha chunaav se pehle party se munh pher liya
 Vinod Sharma, once Hooda's friend, formed the Jan Chetna Party
 party ke bheetar captain ajay yadav or kiran choudhary hooda ko aankh dikhaa rahe hai
 However, Hooda ignores this stampede, "in a democracy everybody has the right to choose his party
 isse congress kii chunavi sambhaavnaaon par asar nahin padegaa
 ”(see conversation)
 lekin yah sab aise mode par ho rahaa he, jab teen maah pehle hue loksabhaa chunaav main rajya kii 10 main se 7 siton par bijepi ne paracham fahraaya he
 Not only this, the BJP, which was reduced to around 9% votes in the last three consecutive assembly elections, got 35% votes overnight
 isse hooda hi nahin, jat raajnneeti ke sartaaj rahe devilal ke rajnatik vaarison kii bhi neend haraam ho gai
 The bjp's confidence is so strong that the party flatly refused to take care of the Haryana Janhit Congress, an ally in the Lok Sabha
 haalat yah he ki 19 agast ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ghoshit taur par sarkari lekin swabhaav se party kii raily jaise kaarykram main kaithal pahunche to mukhyamantri to manch par maujuud the, lekin kuldeep bishnoi kahin najar nahin aae
 Whereas both parties had an alliance in the Lok Sabha
 gathbandhan kii sambhaavna par mukhi kii do-took suniye, “ham gathbandhan ke haq main hai, lekin purana formula ab nahin chalegaa
 If there is no alliance, then the party is ready to contest elections in all 90 seats
 ”is sabake bich hooda is baat kii ummid lagaae hai ki congress ko uskaa paaramparik dalit vot milegaa, iske saath hi jat netaa hone ke naate jat unke saath aaenge
 He has great hope from the development work done during his tenure and the many concessions being given to the farmers
 sarkari karmchaariyon ke ritairement kii umr do saal badhaane se unhen madhyamvarg kaa samarthan milane kii bhi ummid he
 Interestingly, the BJP has the most eye on this class
 duusari taraf ieneldi kii ummiden hai
 If there was a normal opportunity, the possibility of inld's victory in this election would have been expected because except in 2009, in the last 30 years, the key to the power of Haryana has been once in the hands of the Congress and once in the hands of the Chautala family
 lekin is baar sthiti alag he
 Omprakash Chautala, who is associated with the public in his green crest, is not available for campaigning and his brother Ajay is also in jail
 abhaya jail main pita or bhai se jaakar salaah-mashvira to kar lete hai, lekin yah chunaav main chautaala kii pratyaksh maujuudagi kii bharpai to nahin kar saktaa
 Abhay also accepts this
 (dekhen baatcheet)aankadon ke lihaaj se bhi chunaav fansaa hua he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP got 35 and Congress and ANLD got 23 and 24 percent votes respectively
 voton kaa sameekaran jab is baarik str tak pahunch jaataa he, tabhi haryana ke falak par bahujan samaaj party kii supremeo mayawati kii yaad aati he
 His party has been gaining between 4 and 6 per cent of votes in the last three assembly elections and the last Lok Sabha election
 lekin is baar mayawati ne congress kii gaadi se utre purv saansad dow
 Arvind Sharma has played bets
 mayawati ne saaf kaha, “party uttar pradesh ke pattern par haryana main bhi akele chunaav ladegi
 Sharma of the Brahmin community will be the party's chief ministerial candidate
 ” mayawati kaa dalit-brahman gathbandhan agar kuch bhi chhap chhodie main kaamyaab rahaa to rajya main rajnatik aankadon kaa santulan dagamagaa saktaa he
 Well, the last but most interesting player of this fight is Gopal Goyal Kanda, Independent MLA from Sirsa
 ve geetika sharma khudakushi cond main dedh saal jail main bitaane ke baad apni party banaakar maidan main hai
 Despite the presence of so many players, the wait is still awaited as both the ruling Congress and the ruling BJP have not yet declared tickets
 aise main pehle mol-bhav or phir sauda na patane par paala badal kii apaar sambhaavnaaen khuli hui hai
 Yes, INLD has opened its cards by declaring tickets
 aise main chunavi reliyon or dhul udaati gadipoon ke kaphilon ke bich 60 fisadi kam barish kaa saamana kar rahe haryana ke kisaan indra dev kaa gussa kis par utaarenge, iske liye un chapaalon par najar rakhni hogi jahaan hukka bade karine se ghumta rahata he
 And those villages have to be taken care of, where women stay in the veil and even haul the bullock cart

 canada ke pradhanmantri justin trudo kii bharat yatra ke dauraan punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne canada ke adhikariyon ko khalistaan samarthak canada main active kai sanghathanon or political partiyon ke netaaon kii list saunpi thi or bataaya tha ki kis tarah se ye log canada main punjab or bharat ke khilaaf ek alag khalistaan banaae jane kii muhim chalaae hue hai
 Despite this, on the occasion of Salana Sikh Day Parade held in Canada, not only open slogans were raised in support of Khalistan, but posters of the Campaign Referendum 20-20, being run by the supporters of Khalistan, were also raised to demand a separate Khalistan
 hairaan karne vaali baat ye he ki canada main yojit kii gai is parade ke kaarykram main canada ke pradhanmantri justin trudo or canada ke kai mantri bhi shaamil hue
 However, despite the pressure created by the Chief Minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh on this matter, the Prime Minister and the Government of Canada, the Punjab Government put the ball in the court of the Central Government for the ongoing pro-khalistan activities in Canada
 punjab ke cabinet mantri sukhjinder randhaava ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar or captain amarinder singh ke dabaav ke baavjood canada main khalistaan samarthak gatividhiyaan kyun jari hai
 Only the central government can answer this
 unhone khalistaan kii soch ko bevajaah kii soch bataate hue kaha ki agar videsh main baithe kuch khalistaan samarthak alag khalistaan bananaa chaahate bhi hai to wo punjab kii jameen par to kabhi nahin banane vaala
 If still some people want to make Khalistan, then they can make their own Khalistan by seeking land from the foreign governments in the countries in which they live
 duusari ore akali dal ne bhi is puure maamle par golmol jawaab dete hue kaha ki canada sarkaar par dabaav kyun nahin kaam aayaa ye to centre sarkaar hi bataa sakati he, lekin punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne khalistaan se jude mudde kaa canada ke pradhanmantri ke bharat or punjab ke daure ke dauraan khub siyaasi phayda uthaaya
 Akali Dal spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said that despite the pressure of the central government and Punjab government, pro-khalistan activities are continuing in Canada and such videos continue to come out of Canada the day after, but despite this, anti-india Khalistan in Canada No special efforts are made by the Canadian government to stop supporters

 Director Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, who is filming on the lack of toilets, is actually building toilets in the slums where he is shooting
 filmkaar apni agali film 'mere pyaare prime ministar' ko ghatkoper kii ek jhuggi basti main filma rahe hai
 In such a situation, the slums which have got NOC from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) are going to build toilets there
 rakesh om prakaash mehara ne ab agle 4 saalon main 800 tailet banane kaa target rakhaa he
 Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, famous for films like 'rang De Basanti' and 'bhaag Milkha Bhaag', has been collaborating with NGO Yuva Unstoppable for the last four years
 jab is vishay par unase sawaal kiya gaya, to is baat par jor dete hai kaha ki unka yogadan 'sagar main ek boond bhi nahin he
 He said, 'we do not just go away from there by constructing the toilet, but we also take care that the local people should also look after it properly

 The biggest obstacle for Mehra was that the slums of the city were built on unauthorized land owned by BMC and hence they could not legally build toilets there
 kyonki vahaan na to pipeline thi na pani
 When he was questioned on this subject, he insisted that his contribution is not even a drop in the ocean
 unhone kaha, ' ham sirf shauchalay kaa nirmaan kar vahaan se chale nahin jate, balki ham yah bhi dhyaan rakhte hai ki sthaneey log sahi se uski dekh-rekh bhi karen
 We are meeting with the slums and corporators of the area, in which we are asking them to donate one rupee so that they can give their dues to the community employees

 will begin
 iske baad 6 taarikh se ek doosraa western disturbance dastak de degaa
 This weather system will be more powerful than the former due to which there is a possibility of heavy rains and heavy snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh as well as all areas of Uttarakhand
 khaas baat 4 janvari se shuru hone ja rahaa barish or barfbaari kaa yah daur agle 5 se 6 dinon tak chalegaa
 It is being said that this weather system which is going to knock in Jammu and Kashmir is very strong and due to this, there is a possibility of heavy to very heavy snowfall in many areas

 Night temperature is also not going to drop in the recent past and it is being said that the temperature will remain between 9 ° c to 11 ° c in the coming 1 week, that is to say directly of Delhi
 Winter is not going to be the same this time as it usually is

 To understand the basis on which this apprehension was expressed, we have to understand the construction of the Himalayas
 bhuvaigyanikon ke mutabik qareeb pachaas karod saal pehle dharti do bade mahadwipon main banty hui thi
 Eurasia and Gondwana Land
 dharti ke vikaas kram main gondvanaa land kai tukdon main bikharakar alag-alag dishaao kii ore badha
 a part of it which became the Indian subcontinent collided with the Eurasian Plate on the north side
 donon platon ke bich isi takkar or ragad se bani silavaton se himalay bana he
 This collision continues and the result is that the height of the Himalayas is increasing even today
 bhartiya plate aaj bhi paanch centimetre prati varsh kii dar se urasian plate par dabaav bana rahi he yaa kahen ki uske neeche khisak rahi he
 Earthquakes occur here when the energy released between the two plates is released while staying under the hidden energy
 is himalayan ilaake main aath kii tivrata ke aasapaas ke bukamp aate rahe hai
 Such as Shillong in 1897, Kangra in 1905, Bihar Nepal border in 1934 and Assam earthquake in 1950
 kangra se shilong ke bich kii yahi ek hazaar kilometre lambii belt he jahaan zamin ke neeche bhayanak bechaini bani hui he
 This is called the Central Psychological Gap
 yahaan donon tactonic platon ke bich bad rahaa dabaav apane bheetar bhayanak urja samete hue baitha he
 The comments nepal main aayaa bukamp isi urja ke release hone kaa zariyaa bana he
 Now the question is, will this process stop after this? The answer is no
 bhartiya plate ke urasian plate se takaraane kaa silsilaa jari he or ye dabaav aage kisi or ilaake main kisi or bukamp kii shakl main saamne aa saktaa he
 The most feared is in the Central Psychological Gap
 ab aise bukampon se hone vaale nuksaan se bachane kaa ek hi tarika he ki bhawan nirmaan main bukamparodhi takanic kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 We have got this understanding in our inheritance which we are forgetting due to small greed
 vaise ye kaha hi jaataa he ki bukamp hamen nahin martha

 donon platon ke bich bad rahe is dabaav main chuphi urja rah rahakar jab release hoti he to yahaan bukamp aate hai
 There have been earthquakes of around eight magnitude in this Himalayan region
 jaise 1897 main shilong, 1905 main kangra, 1934 main bihar nepal border or 1950 main assam kaa bhayanak bukamp
 This is the one thousand kilometer long belt between Kangra and Shillong where there is terrible restlessness under the ground
 ise central sizmik gap kaha jaataa he
 Here the increasing pressure between the two tectonic plates is sitting within it, containing terrible energy
 tippaniyan The earthquake in Nepal has been a source of release of this energy
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya iske baad ye silsilaa tham jayega? jawaab he nahin
 The Indian plate continues to collide with the Eurasian Plate and this pressure may be further exposed in the form of another earthquake in another area
 sabase zyaada ashanka he central sizmik gap main
 Now the only way to avoid damage from such earthquakes is to use seismic technology in building construction
 ye samajhadaari hamen viraasat main bhi mili he jise ham chote-chote laalchon kii vajah se bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 By the way, it is said that earthquake does not kill us

 offis of profit maamle main chunaav ayog kii sunwaayee se aam aadmi party ek baar phir asahmat he
 Party legislators have filed a writ in the High Court accusing the Election Commission of not hearing the whole case
 'aap' vidhayak alka lamba ne bataaya ki shuukravaar ko aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ne hoicourt kaa rukh kiya he
 Alka Lamba, in a special conversation with Aaj Tak, has made several big allegations on the Election Commission
 unhone kaha ki isse pehle hoicourt ne chunaav ayog ke faisle ko palat diya tha
 But even now, the Election Commission is not allowing the Aam Aadmi Party mlas to answer questions from the petitioner
 'aap' vidhayakon ne poocha he ki aakhir chunaav ayog yachikakarta ko kyon bachaana chaahate hai?'aap'vidhayak ne offis of profit ko nakaarte hue safai di he
 Asked the reason for going to the High Court again, Alka Lamba says that all the 70 mlas have offices
 lekin wo daphtar sansadeey sachiv ke taur par nahin mili the
 To overcome this doubt, the petitioner and the filing officers should be questioned
 itnaa saaf he ki aam aadmi party ke vidhayak chunaav ayog main dobaaraa ho rahi sunwaayee se sahamat nahin hai
 Alka Lamba alleges that the way the Election Commission is hearing is clearly under pressure
 17 may se 27 may tak 10 din jaise-taise sunwaayee ko niptaya gaya he
 Before this, the decision comes on February 19 and on February 21, the President stamps
 agar hoicourt hamen raahat nahin detaa to ek aloktantric kaam ko anjaam diya chukaa tha
 Asked if the Aam Aadmi Party's 20 mlas are afraid of losing membership
 jawaab main alka lamba ne kaha ki yah 20 vidhayakon kii sadsyta kaa maamla nahin he
 It is a matter of decreasing trust in constitutional institutions
 hamen kursi kii chintaa nahin he, balki loktantr ke saath khele jane vaale khel kii chintaa he
 We hope that the High Court will hear our favor

 The suspension of the principal was taken after the District Magistrate complained to Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal
 pilibhit main ek sarkari skool ke principal ko vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) or bajrang dal kii sthaneey ikai kii shikaayat par nilambit kar diya gaya
 These organizations alleged that the students were singing the song 'lab pe aati hai dua banke tamanna meri' in the morning prayer
 kavita 'lab pe aati he dua' ko allamaa ikbaal ke naam se prasiddh mohammad ikbaal ne 1902 main likhi thi
 Iqbal also wrote 'saare Jahan Se Achch Hindustan Hamara'
 'lab pe aati he dua' aaj bhi desh ke kai hisson main gaaya jaataa he
 It is sung daily in every madrasa and schools in Pakistan

 He found in his investigation that children in school used to sing the same poem often in the morning assembly
 is prakaran par pilibhit ke jila adhikari vaibhav shrivastav ne kaha ki principal ko isliye nilambit kiya gaya he kyonki vah chaatro se raashtragan nahin karwaata tha
 If the principal wanted to teach any other poem to the students, they should seek permission
 agar vah chaatro se koi kavita gaan karaate hai or raashtragan nahin karaate hai to unke khilaaf aarope banataa he
 Suspended Principal rejected the charge, however, suspended teacher Furkan Ali (45) has dismissed the allegations against him
 unka kahana he ki chaatr lagaataar raashtragan karte hai or ikbaal kii kavita kaksha ek se aath tak urdu paathyakram kaa hissaa he
 He further said, 'VHP and Hindu Yuva Vahini activists protested outside the school and collectorate, demanding the removal of me
 maine sirf vah kavita gaai he jo sarkari skool ke paathyakram kaa hissaa he
 My students also raise patriotic slogans like 'bharat Mata Ki Jai' during the meeting every day
