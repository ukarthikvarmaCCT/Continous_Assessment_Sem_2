 According to the report, the company is now working on a new app / service that works like an airdrop
 airdrop ios main diya gaya ek feechar he jiske jariye ios divaais yani yphone main file transfar kiye jate hai
 Currently, there is no dedicated feature in Android through which you can transfer files
 iske liye aapako yaa to bluetooth yuj karnaa hota he yaa phir koi third party ap
 Although such features are available in customer Android, but this is not available in stock Android
 google ke nae file transfar ap kaa namakthith taur par File Go rakhaa gaya he
 It will not only be a file sharing app but it will also do memory management and cleanup
 lekin iskaa mukhya focus file transfar bataaya ja rahaa he
 However, to transfer files, it is necessary to have this app in the smartphone of the sender and receiver
 lekin airdrop ke saath aisa nahin he, kyonki iske jariye bina kisi ap ke aap yphone se yphone main file transfar kar sakate hai
 a screenshot of 9to5google has also been inserted which resembles the airdrop in view
 file transfar ke liye internet conection kii jarurat nahin hogi or yah fast hoga
 In this screenshot some tabs can be seen which include features like file, storage, image, video, send / receive and clear cache
 philhal File Go ap google play store par downlod ke liye uplabdh nahin he or ise beta program main dekha gaya he
 So, it is not yet known when it will be launched

 Android Go can be given in smartphones with less than 1GB RAM
 is khaas oes ke liye company kuch khaas ap bhi bana rahi he jo is oes par chalenge

 BJP sources said Shah will come to Kolkata today and inaugurate a community Durga Puja and also address a seminar
 shah bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh bhi hai
 He is coming to Bengal for the first time after becoming Union Home Minister this year
 yah sangoshtee aise vakt main ho rahi he jab pashchim bengal main NRC ke lagu hone ke kathith dar se 11 logon kii maut ho chuki he

 BJP leaders in West Bengal accused TMC that TMC was deliberately trying to create panic in the state over NRC

 sansadeey samiti ke adhyaksh pramukh congress netaa em virappa moili hai

 isi ke anuroop note chhapane vaali chhapaakhaanon ko nai siries ke noton kaa shurati utpaadan karne ko kaha gaya
 The new design and the new denomination had a fascination for the people, hence it was decided that 2,000 notes should be printed in sufficient numbers so that they can be made available across the country simultaneously
 arabiai ne kaha ki sarkaar ne apni 7 november kii salaah main is baat kaa ullekh kiya ki nakadi se kaledhan main madad milti he kyonki nakad len-dein kaa audit nahin ho paata

 ye note padosi desh main ban rahe hai jo ki desh kii suraksha or akhandta ke liye gambhir khatra hai
 In such a situation, the government recommended removing 500 and 1,000 notes from circulation
 notebandi kii sifarish ke liye rigerv bank ke board ne nishkarsh nikaala ki yah prastaav isse achche samay nahin aa saktaa tha, jabaki saath hi nai shrinkhalaa ke note aa rahe hai
 This allows the existing notes to be removed and new design notes with more security features
 kendriya bank ne kaha ki rigerv bank ke karyaalayon main 2,000 ke note aa rahe hai or inhen deshbhar main karency chest main bheja ja rahaa hai

 haalanki ‘kik’ ne 2014 main pehle din sabase zyada kamai kaa record apane naam kar liya, lekin pehle din ke bollywood record se yah film kaaphi peeche rah gai
 Aamir Khan's film 'dhoom-3' is the highest grossing Bollywood record on the first day of release
 dhooma ne relies ke pehle hi din gharelu bazaar main 36
 Did business of Rs 32 crores
 iske alaava shahrukh khan kii film ‘chennai express’ ne pehle din ke kaarobaar main hi 33
 12 crores
 diarector sajid nadiadwala ne film ‘kik’ ke saath apane nirdesan kariyar kii shuruyaat kii he
 But in terms of first day's earnings, this film of Salman Khan also fell far behind his own record
 2012 main id ke maukey par relies hui salmaan kii film ‘ek tha tiger’ ne pehle din gharelu bazaar main 32
 Had done a business of Rs 90 crores
 haalanki salmaan ke liye khushi kii baat ye he ki janvari main relies hui unki film ‘jai ho’ ke mukaable ‘kik’ ko kaaphi acchhee opening mili he
 'jai Ho' just 17 on the first day
 55 karod rupee kaa kaarobaar kiya tha or 15 din ke baad film main 100 karod rupee ke aankade ko chhu paayi thi
 According to experts, Salman has a tremendous fan following among young Muslims and his film has not been able to get a better opening due to Roja
 iske saath hi unki film ko sabase acchhee opening nahin milane ke peeche ek or kaaran bhi bataaya ja rahaa he
 This is believed to be Salman's proximity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mana ja rahaa he ki modi se salmaan kii nazdikiyon ke kaaran muslim yuva utani badi sankhya main ‘kik’ dekhne nahin pahunche, jitne aksar pahunchaa karte the
 Karan Johar tied Salman's praises on one side, Salman's 'kick' is making a big splash on the big screen and he has got another strong fan as Karan Johar
 karan johar salmaan kii tarif karte nahin thak rahe, ve apane twitor account par ‘kik’ kii jamkar tarif kar rahe hai
 Ever since Salman has signed 'shuddhi', Karan has been praising Salman fiercely
 gauratlab he ki rithik roshan ne film chhod di he or ranbir film ke liye manaa kar chuke hai
 It will be worth noting that how his friend Shahrukh Khan would feel after hearing Salman's praise from Karan's mouth

 In order to make the election fair, the Election Commission also appears to be in a tight mood this time

 madhya pradesh congress ne apane kul nau vigyapanon ko chunaav ayog ke paas anumati ke liye bheja tha, jisamen se 6 par aapatti jataai gai he
 The Election Commission says that it also has an advertisement related to the Rafael controversy and since this matter is in the Supreme Court, it would not be appropriate to use it in the election campaign
 madhya pradesh chunaav ayog ke pramukh vielke raav kaa kahana he ki agar is aadesh se kisi party ko aapatti he, to vah is par apil kar sakate hai
 Significantly, the Congress has been taking an aggressive stand on the alleged scam in the Rafale plane deal
 rafel maamle ko lekar hi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne 'chaukeedaar chor he' kaa naaraa diya he, jisko lekar congress chunaav main aage bad rahi he
 Even on behalf of the Congress, it is being said that if their government is formed then they can also get the Rafale case investigated
 gauratlab he ki chunaav ayog isse pehle bhi bhaajapa ke ‘main bhi chaukeedaar’ par aapatti darj kar chukaa tha, jisamen ‘main bhi chaukeedaar’ cap kaa istemaal trainon main kiya ja rahaa tha
 In this regard, the commission had also asked to take action against the railway officials
 ‘modi kii byopic par sankat nahin’vahiin pradhanmantri narendra modi kii jindagi par ban rahi film ‘piem narendra modi’ par chunaav ayog ko koi aapatti nahin he
 The Election Commission says that the censor board has given the certificate to the film, in such a situation, the EC cannot decide when the film is released

 But the Commission has made it clear that releasing the film during the election process is not a violation of the code of conduct

 Addressing the 85th General Assembly of industry body FICCI, Manmohan said, “we have recently started the move to move directly towards cash transfer system
 iske tahat sarkaar dwaara die jane vaale laabhon ko sidhe labhaarthi ke bank khate main daalaa jaayegaa
 This will reduce corruption, eliminate middlemen and benefits will reach the beneficiary directly without any delay

 He said that this scheme of cash transfer under Aadhaar number will bring about a big change in the system

 Ankit Chadha, who led Dastangoi to a different place, became a story himself today
 mahaj 30 baras kii umr main vah duniya ko alavida kah gaye
 In 2011, young Dastango Ankit Chadha, who was engaged in giving new life to 'dastangoi', the art of telling the 13th century Urdu story, died at the age of 30
 dilli ke lodhi road sthit vidyut shavadah grih main aaj unka antim sanskaar kiya gaya
 Ankit died of drowning in the Uksan lake near Pune on Wednesday evening
 unke kareebi paariwarik sambandhi ne kaha, 'vah pune apni ek prastuti dene gaya tha, jahaan paas main hi ek jhil main ghoomane ke dauraan uskaa pair phisal gaya
 He died due to drowning in the lake
 'unhone kaha ki uske doobane ke kai ghante baad uske shav ko baahar nikaala ja sakaa
 Chadha's program 'dastaan dhai Aakhar Ki' was to be held at the Gyan Adab Kendra in Pune on 12 May
 7 saal main taiyaar kii dastanek intervyuu main chaddha ne kaha tha ki kabir kii vaani par aadhaarit is dastaan ko taiyaar karne main uskaa 7 saal se adhik vakt gujara tha
 In this story, Chadha worked to connect the story of Kabir's love dialogue, along with the technical aspects of the present day mobile, youtube etc
 dohe or aam jindagi ke bahut se kisse pirokar yah dastaan taiyaar kii gai thi
 Born in a middle-class Punjabi family, Chadha's dastangoi mentioned Kabir besides Dara Shikoh, Amir Khusro and Rahim but his woven story about the life of Mahatma Gandhi was liked in the country and abroad
 7 saal pehle di thi pehali prastutichaddha ne apni pehali prastuti 2011 main di thi or 2012-13 ke dauraan unhone akele prastuti dena shuru kar diya tha
 Before returning to Pune, he recently returned to perform in Kabir and Gandhi's Tales in Seattle and California
 chaddha ke guru mahmud faruki ne chaddha kii maut ko ek 'apurnty kshati' bataaya
 Writer and director Farooqui said, 'he was a shining star and he was developing his own way of Dastangoi
 usne vastav main is vidha main kai nae prayog jode the
 He used to connect the people sitting in front of him and only a clean hearted person can do this work
 'unhone kaha, 'vah farsi or urdu sikh rahaa tha or apane kaam ko lagaataar behatar kar rahaa tha
 Like Chadha, Chadha started a job after graduation, but then he moved towards this mode of Urdu and after that he left the job and took this path
 'jashn-e-rekhta' or 'mahindra kabir utsav' jaise kaaryakramon main apni pratibha kaa loha manavaa chuke chaddha ne harvard, yel or toronto jaise vishvavidhyalayon main bhi apni prastutiyaan di thim
 According to the latest report on tigers, there has been the largest increase in the number of wagons in Assam and the number has increased from 143 in 2010 to 167
 uttar purvi pahadiyon or brahmaputra ke baadh vaale maidani ilaake main 2010 main 148 ke mukaable baaghon kii sankhya bad kar 2014 main 201 ho gai he
 In 2006, in Arunachal Pradesh, 14 tigers had increased to 28
 arunachal pradesh main 2010 main surveykshan nahin kiya gaya tha
 Apart from Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, other areas included in the status report are Mizoram and North Bengal
 kshetra ke saat baagh abhyaarany main assam ke maanas, kajiranga or nameri, arunachal pradesh ke pakke or namdafa, mizoram ke dampa or pashchim bengal ke buksa shaamil he
 The report said that Kaziranga National Park in Assam has the highest tiger population at 157 while the Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh has the lowest number of four tigers
 20 janvari ko ek saath ek anya report ‘connecting tiger papulation for long turm conjarveshan’ main bataaya gaya he ki ilaake main billi prajatiyon ke jantuon kii sankhya kaa aitihaasik vikasvaadi mahatv he kyonki dakshin purvi asian baagh aabaadi ke saath unki jin aadhaarit saajhedaari he
 There are two tiger reserve units (tcus) in the region, one of which is Manas tiger reserve extending from Bhutan to Arunachal in the northeast
 doosraa assam kaa kajiranga abhyaarany he or yah meghalaya tak failaa hua he
 There are 125 tigers in the area, including the Kaziranga tiger reserve, along with other protected areas nearby
 yah carbi anglong pahadiyon ke raste uttar purvi bhukhand ke dakshini bhaagon se judaa hua he jo baaghon kii sankhya main vruddhi ke liye ek pramukh strot ke taur par kaary karata he
 However, due to extensive cultivation at the northern end of the Brahmaputra river, this contact in the north breaks
 report ke mutabik, kajiranga, orange neshnal park se mila hua he or brahmaputra nadi ke dwipon se judaa hua he
 Nameri is also connected by river corridors which is important for gene flow in increasing numbers of tigers in the plains and hilly areas of Arunachal Pradesh
 lakshith sangrakshan ke prayaason ke liye vibhinn rashtriya parkon or vanyajeev abhyaaranyon ke bich kaa ye sampark mahatvapurn tatv he
 Manas Tiger Sanctuary has cameras installed and is estimated to be 1 per 100 square kilometers
 8 baaghon kaa nivas he
 The area is of high caliber and due to the control of poaching, tiger population is expected to increase, especially in the southern parts
 report main bataaya gaya he ki assam kaa nameri, arunachal pradesh ke pakke se sata hua he or yahaan par baaghon kii kam sankhya, lagbhag nau he
 It states that the area has the potential to increase the number of tigers and maintain its numbers, but the number of tigers has increased due to poaching and other problems
 inputah bhashaa Olympic champion Yogeshwar Dutt, who is a stronghold of mankongress-inld, has been competing in the political arena, Yogeshwar Dattbaroda, from one of the strongholds of Baroda Akhada, Olympic champion Yogeshwar Dutt is now coming down in the political riot of Haryana
 yogeshwar dutt ne bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he or congress va inelo ke majboot durg maane jane vaale sonipat jile kii baroda vidhansabha seat se chunavi akhaade main utarane kaa man banaaya he
 Yogeshwar Dutt aajtak
 in se baatcheet karte hue kaha, 'achche log raajnneeti main aa rahe hai to unki ichha hui ki raajnneeti main bhi haath aajamaaya jaae
 i am impressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 unki eemaandaaree ne mujhe bijepi main shaamil hone ke liye aakarshith kiya
 Both PM Modi and Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar are doing a lot for the youth
 'yogeshwar dutt ne kaha ki vaise to puraa haryana hamaara he lekin baroda hamaari janmabhumi he
 In such a situation, our first wish is to contest elections from our region, on which the party has to decide
 ham bijepi main ek kaaryakarta ke taur par aae hai, party jo bhi aadesh degi use ham sweekaar karenge
 However, he said that he has a strong team of youth in the Baroda region and if the party gives tickets then it will definitely be a lotus
 congress-inelo kaa rahaa kabjabta den kiyogeshwar dutt jis barodavidhansabha seat se chunavi maidan main utarane kaa man bana rahe hai
 It is considered a stronghold of Congress and INLD
 bijepi is seat par kabhi khaataa nahin khol saki he
 This is the reason that despite the Modi wave in 2014, BJP could not defeat Shrikrishna Hooda from Congress
 hooda is seat se lagaataar duusari baar vidhayak hai or teesri baar chunavi maidan main utarane kii taiyaari main hai
 Hooda's strong Garhishkrishna Hooda started his political journey as a panchayat member and was twice elected sarpanch
 ve 5 baar vidhansabha chunaav jite hai, jisamen se teen baar unhone gadhi saanpala kiloi se jeet darj kii or do baar baroda seat se vidhayak chune gaye
 Shri Krishna Hooda left the Indian National Lok Dal in 2005 and joined the Congress
 kya jeet darj kar paaenge yogeshwar?baroda vidhansabha seat par lambey samay tak inelo kaa kabja rahaa he
 The INLD did not lose a single election from 1977 to 2005
 is seat par jat, brahmanon or phir daliton kaa dabadabaa rahaa he
 Most of the fights here have been between Congress and INLD
 yogeshwar dutt brahman samudayase aate hai
 While Shri Krishna Hooda comes from the Jat community
 mana ja rahaa he ki inelo or jejepi bhi yahaan jat samudaay par daanv laga sakati he
 In such a situation, Yogeshwar is in the battle of feeding the lotus of the BJP in the battle between the three Jats

 Terming the Congress government of Karnataka as anti-farmer and anti-hindu, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has appealed to the voters here to free the state from Congress rule by following the path of the northeast voters
 mangalvaar raat ko yahaan ek raily main unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ne yahaan bhrashtachar mukt or aparaadh mukt sarkaar banane ke liye suraksha yatra shuru kii he

 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa sabhi rajyon main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke naare sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kaa paalan kar rahi he
 He said in his address that people should keep in mind the election results of the Northeast where Congress did not get a single seat in two states
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki karnataka ko bhi congress mukt hona chahie kyonki yah party desh ke logon ke liye araajaktaa lekar ai thi
 That is why people in all states are choosing BJP
 yah is baat kaa saboot he ki log vikaas ke agenda ko sweekaar kar rahe hai
 Adityanath alleged that security and development in Karnataka is in danger and the jihadi elements are in bliss by getting the support of the state government

 The UP Chief Minister said that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh had done loan waiver of Rs 8,000 crore to the farmers without demanding money from the central government

 maharashtra main mukhyamantri pad par fansaa he pechshivsena ke saamne 1995 kaa formulamaharashtra main mukhyamantri pad ko lekar bijepi or shivasena ke bich siyaasi sangram jari he
 In such a situation, BJP leader and Union Minister Raosaheb Danve has suggested Balasaheb Thackeray's 1995 formula for government formation
 iske tahat adhik siten paane vaale dal kaa mukhyamantri or kam siten paane vaale dal kaa upmukhyamantri bana tha
 In such a situation, the question arises that except the two-and-a-half-year formula, will the Shiv Sena accept the 24-year-old formula? What was the 1995 formula? In Maharashtra, the BJP and Shiv Sena first formally contested in 1990
 iske baad duusari baar1995 main bijepi-shivasenaane milakar chunavi kismat aajamaaya tha
 It was decided between BJP leader Pramod Mahajan and Shiv Sena chief Balasaheb Thackeray, who is called the architect of bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra, that the BJP will do politics at the Center and the Shiv Sena will remain in the state politics
 zyada siten jeetne vaale kaa siemiske saath hi yah bhi tay hua tha ki maharashtra main jisaki siten adhik aaengi, uskaa mukhyamantri banegaa or jisaki siten kam hongi, uskaa upmukhyamantri
 The Shiv Sena had managed to win 73 seats and BJP won 65 seats by contesting 169 seats
 aise main gathbandhan kii shart ke anusaar shivasena ko mukhyamantri or bijepi ko upmukhyamantri kaa pad mila tha
 At the same time, major ministries like Home Office, Revenue and PWD were also got by BJP
 is tarah bijepi or shivasena ne milakar paanch saal sarkaar chalaaya
 Will the Shiv Sena agree to the 1995 formula ? Actually, BJP has got 105 seats and Shiv Sena 56 seats in this time assembly elections
 shivasena chaar nirdaleey vidhayakon ke samarthan kaa daawa kar rahi he, to bijepi 15 nirdaleey vidhayakon ke saath hone kaa dam dikhaa rahi he
 The term of the Legislative Assembly in Maharashtra expires on 9 November
 , usase pehle nai sarkaar kaa gathan hona he
 Will the Shiv Sena agree to the 1995 formula demanding a two-and-a-half-year chief minister with a formula of Maharashtra 50-50
 iske tahat bijepi kaa siem or shivasena dipti siem ke saath grih, rajasav or peedblyoody jaise mantralay ke saath sarkaar banane ke liye sahamat hogi
 Although the Shiv Sena joined the government in 2014, a month after it broke away from the BJP, but no major ministry came out of it except the PWD
 yahaan tak ki centre sarkaar main 2014 main bhi use sirf ek baari udyog mantralay mila tha, or is baar use sirf isi ek mantralay se ab tak santosh karnaa pad rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Shiv Sena, which has emerged as a major link in the politics of Maharashtra, wants to equalize both the center and the state
 aise main 1995 ke formule par shivasena raji hogi

 UPI has gone a step further in which you have to enter the virtual ID of the recipient of the money on your smartphone and after that the app asks for a PIN which has to be re-inserted
 iske baad paisa apane aap aapke khate se praptakarta ke khate main chalaa jaataa he or isamen kuch hi minute lagate hai
 For this, neither you have to provide your bank account details nor the IFSC code of the recipient's bank
 kuch aasaan kadamon main aap lakhon kaa len-dein kar sakate hai
 The app on your phone is not necessarily the same bank in which you have an account, but can be of any other bank which gives you a better experience
 yahi baat praptakarta ke saath bhi lagu hoti he
 Money transactions, however, take place between you and the recipient's banks and you don't even know it

 This work is being carried out by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an organization dealing with all retail payments in India, which operates under the Reserve Bank of India
 iske das pravartak bank hai: bhartiya state bank, punjab neshnal bank, kenra bank, bank of baroda, union bank of india, bank of india, isiisiaai bank, echdiefasi bank, city bank or echesbisi
 a team of 15 people are working in developing this app and are in coordination with technical teams of various banks to make it a reality
 kya yah nai ap he?upiai kaa koi apana ek ap nahin hoga balki yah bainkon ko unke maujuuda ap main upiai ke function daalane kii suvidha degaa yaa phir bank chahen to apni alag se upiai ap banavaa sakenge
 "there is no common app as it hurts new thinking and discovery," says Dilip Asbe, chief operating officer of NPCI
 ham chaahate hai ki udyog kii vruddhi ke saath hi nae prayog bhi lagaataar hote rahen
 RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said while inaugurating UPI, "india has a state-of-the-art infrastructure for public payments
" sirf bhugtan ke tareeke hi is kranti kaa hissaa nahin hai balki nae tarah ke bainkon kii puri ek jamaat he jo aage aa rahi he
 In the story, the central bank gave in-principle approval to 11 payment banks and 10 small banks in 2015
 peedblusi, india ke mutabik, bharat main ab bhi 23
 3 crore people are not connected to banks
 desh ke zyaadaatar log ab bhi nakad main kaarobaar karte hai, jisaki laagat bahut zyada aati he
 Asbe says that the RBI is printing 4,000 crore every year in printing currency
 kharch karata he
 This figure shows the prevalence of cash payments despite the widespread use of e-commerce and debit / credit cards
 philhal desh main 15 karod smartphone prayokta hai or agle paanch saal main mana ja rahaa he ki inaki sankhya badhkar 50 karod tak pahunch jaaegi
 In recent months, there has been a huge boom in mobile banking in India as banks have provided platforms to retail and corporate customers from which they can transact on mobile phones
 arabiai kaa aankada dikhaata he ki mobile phone ke madhyam se len-dein disambar 2015 main saal bhar pehle ke mukaable chaar guna se zyada badhkar 49,029 karod ru
 Had reached
 upiai is raftaar ko or badha saktaa he
 Kunal Pandey, partner at KPMG India, says, "UPI has the potential to rejuvenate mobile payments
 '' graahakon ke liye iskaa matlab hoga kai logon ke saath len-dein karne se aazaadee
 According to him, this will increase the transaction rate for the banks as this task will become much easier
 alag hoga upiai se petm?petm jaise ap or upiai ke bich ek ahm fark yah hoga ki petm ek aadha-adhuraa mobile wolet he
 This means that anyone who is registered with Paytm can only transact with them
 iske ulat upiai kaa parichaalan bainkon ke bich hota he
 So will UPI eat up businesses like Paytm? Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma says that unlike this, Paytm will benefit only because UPI will open the mobile payment gateway of most banks
 philhal esbiai jaise bank apane getwe main petm ko pravesh kii ijaajat nahin dete hai taaki ve khud apni wolet seva mobicash iji kaa prasar kar saken
 Says Sharma, "UPI is essentially a protocol, a payment mechanism for banks
 yah mobile banking ke digitalykaran main madad degaa
 Mobile wallet services have quickly outnumbered the number of credit card users since coming to market
 arabiai kaa aankada dikhaata he ki desh main disambar 2015 tak 2
 There were 27 crore credit card users who earned Rs 21,468 crore
 ke len-dein kar rahe the
 In contrast, Paytm currently has 12
 6 karod prayokta ho chuke hai or 2018 tak iskaa lakshya 50 karod logon ko apana prayokta bana lenaa he
 According to Sharma, from this app daily, between fifty and seventy crores rupees
 kaa len-dein hota he yani salanaa 18,250 karod ru
 Total transaction of
 yah haal sirf petm kaa he jabaki mobiquik, oxigen, citras pe, emrupi or tata teleservices kii apni alag hissedari he
 Asbe says that there are 1
5 million retail merchants in India but only one million card machines exist
 yahi vajah he ki credit card kaarobaar kii apni simaaen hai jabaki upiai ke saamne maukon kaa puraa maidan khaali he
 How does it work? Suppose Kishore is a Delhi-based businessman and Gautam is a corporate executive who buys his merchandise
 donon ne apane-apane smartphone par pehali baar panjikaran karaane or apane liye virtual aaidi hasil karne ke baad upiai downlod kar liya he
 Kishore now needs money from Gautam in exchange for the sale of his goods
 kishor ke paas bank 'e' kaa khaataa he jabaki uske paas ap bank ''bi' kaa he
 Gautam has an account in bank 'C' while he is using bank 'D' app
 kishor apane bank 'bi' vaale ap kaa istemaal gautam kii virtual aaidi se bhugtan lene ke liye karata he
 This virtual id gautam @ bankd
 com jaisi kuch ho sakati he
 After this, a message is sent to UPI requesting that at the request of bank 'B', there is an account of bank 'A' where the money is to be deposited
 kul milakar bhugtan karne vaale kaa virtual pataa maaloom he
 It sends it to the bank 'D', who already knows that this account is being used on the app of bank 'C'
 ab upiai ko pataa ho jayega ki kis khate se paise nikaalkar kismen jamaa karana he
 This exchange is completed accordingly and an e-mail is sent to both the parties that work is done
 aapako bhugtan karnaa he to aap 'push' kaa vikalp chun sakate hai
 The party who wants to take the money can opt for 'pull'
 is tantra main panjikrut sabhi bainkon main yah len-dein sambhav hoga
 Is it safe? Security was the most important issue before NPCI in making this app
 iske liye donon siron par sakht data sangrakshan or suraksha muhaiyaa karai jaani he
 Use of mobile phones as a certification tool, a virtual ID and third party certification scheme like Aadhaar etc
 can help banks save their costs, allowing them to focus more on their core business
 bhugtan kii sahajata ek or ahm masalaa he
 Paying and receiving money will be as easy as swiping a phonebook entry or making a call from a phone
 jiske paas bhi khaataa he, vah keval ek pahchaan ke madhyam se paise de-le sakegaa jisamen koi or bank vivaran kaam nahin aayega
 This solution should be such that it can be expanded to one billion users
 isamen aadhaar sankhya, virtual pataa or mobile number jaisi kotiyon ke bich sahaj parasparata kaa bhi khyaal rakhaa janaa hoga
 It also has many challenges
 pandey kehete hai, ''isaki kamyaabi is par nirbhar karegi ki log ise kitna sweekaarte hai
 "there should be awareness among people about such payment systems
" bhartiya arthvyavastha kaa bada hissaa ab bhi nakad kendrit he or raturaat chijen nahin badal saktin
 The biggest thing is that there is no central person in UPI, which may make some people find it harmful
 iske baavjood ek baar bainkon ke paas yah takanic aa jane ke baad mobile bhugtan ke kshetra main upiai kayakalp karne vaali takanic sabit hogi
 "in view of all the imperfections of the exchange, there is still room for a new system in place which will displace cash transactions," says Asbe

 During the last two decades, there has been a lot of hue and cry about indigenous production, especially in the field of defense production, while nothing special has happened in the name of progress at the ground level

 Regrettably, this has not been done, although if we look at the cases of indigenous production in the defense sector, it would not be wrong to say that the last decade has been lost
 maujuuda endie sarkaar bhartiya utpaadan ko lekar kaaphi mukhar rahi he jisamen swadeshi raksha utpaadan sabase aage rahaa he
 Several initiatives have been taken for this purpose

 Secondly, defense agreements preferred production in India or shared production with an Indian company

 The dpp's job is to produce indigenous defense in the government and private sector
 haalanki bhartiya udyogon or videshi oiem ke saath uskaa vaisaa rishta nahin he, jaisaa kharid prakoshth kaa he
 Therefore, the promotion of defense industrial facilities should be led by the procurement cell

 This will remove the burden of dealing with complex procurement proposals from the head of the defense secretary and allow them to spend more time on defense policy and strategy, bilateral strategic cooperation as well as administrative issues related to the three wings of the army

 For example, the Pentagon has the provision of full-time under-secretaries for procurement and policy, while in India the policy work is with the Secretary of Defense, while no one is responsible for procurement, but has to go through a very complex system
 kharid prakoshth ko purnakalik sachiv str tak apgrade karnaa is asantulan ko dur kar degaa or usase kaaphi maamla sulajh jayega
 In a larger context, the Ministry of Defense needs to study the organizational structure associated with decision-making within key defense ministries around the world and decide how to make decision-making the best in India at the policy level

 Women undergo many changes and problems during pregnancy
 aise main kai baar unhen tanaav bhi ho jaataa he
 Not only this, sometimes memory can also be affected at this stage
 aisa sharir main ho rahe hormonal badlaav ke kaaran hota he
 But this is not a matter of concern, conditions become completely normal after delivery
 baby brain syndromelogon main aamtaur par dharna hoti he ki 'baby brain' yaa 'preghead' syndrome ke kaaran garbhvatee mahilaon kii yaaddasht kamjor pad jaati he
 But in many researches, it has been proved that there is no such syndrome which has nothing to do with the memory, anyway, the memory does not matter in pregnancy
 shodhon main yah bhi paaya gaya he ki garbhavastha ke dauraan mahilaor uske hone vaale bachche donon par hi dimagi rup se koi nakaaratmak asar nahin padataa
 Do not take care of the mind, women who think that their brain is being affected due to pregnancy or they are losing their memory power, all this is just a feeling or confusion of their mind
 haa ye jarur he ki garbhavastha ke dauraan mahilaayein bahut si chijen bhul jaati he, aisa sirf unke jivan main aa rahe nae badlaavon or anubhavon ke kaaran hota he kyonki garbhavastha ke dauraan ek khaas hormone sakriy ho jaataa he
 Smoking can reduce Yadashthatkay many times, this hormone can also cause Alzheimer's problem
 jiske hone se yaaddasht kamjor hone kii ashanka bani rahati he
 In fact, the secretion of Alzheimer's causative hormones occurs during pregnancy in high amounts, and thus has an effective effect on women who are prone to excessive smoking, intoxication, or alcohol, which can lead to memory loss
 aamtaur par bhi shodhon main sabit ho chukaa he jomahilaayein adhik dhumrapaan karti hai unki yaaddasht kamjor ho jaati he
 Stay away from negative things
 During pregnancy, pregnant woman should eat more things like milk, cheese, almonds to keep fit and memory is not weak or there is no effect on memory
 dimag par padane vaale kisi bhi nakaaratmak asar ko rokane ke liye dhumrapaan ityadi nashili chizon se dur rahanaa chahie
 Not only this, a doctor's advice should be taken daily

 Significantly, after the violence took place in Lucknow on Thursday, after this, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath spoke of taking strong action against the miscreants
 yogi ne kaha tha ki pradesh main hinsa bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi, jo bhi updravi sarkari sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai, unki sampatti jabt kii jaaegi or puri keemat vasuuli jaaegi

 Devadatta Patnaik is the author, his latest book is Shyam: An Illustrated Retelling of Bhagavata) Gods in Hinduism cannot be divine without Goddess
 lakshmi ke bina vishnu apurna hai
 If there is no Shakti, then Shiva is also not
 saraswati ke bina brahma nahin hai
 But for many people, it is a puzzling puzzle how the Hindu religion, which envisages the equal co-existence of both men and women, can treat women so badly
 kya striyaan deviyaan nahin hai? masik dharm ke dauraan unhen ashuddh kyon mana jaataa he? kyon betiyon ko boj samajha jaataa he? unhen shiksha se vanchit rakhkar unke hisse ke sansaadhan beton ko de die jate hai
 Why is there such discrimination? Here is another question we should ask: Is the situation of women better in those religions, where only God or the messengers of God can be men
 udhaaharan ke liye bible ko len, jahaan bataaya jaataa he ki eve kii har beti ko prasav pidaa or eden ke bageeche main shaitan ke ashrith ke rup main uski seva main lag jane kaa "dand'' mila he
 In the Quran, no woman is mentioned except Mary, the virgin mother of Jesus
 aisa lagata he ki sabhi dharm, mul rup se pitrusattatmak hai
 Some feminist anthropologists hold that until the question of property rights was raised, the world was matriarchal in which the earth was worshiped as the Mother Goddess
 lekin sampatti ke adhikaron ne uttaradhikaar ke vichaar ko janm diya or is kaaran pitrutv mahatvapurn ho gaya
 At the same time, the goddess mother, who was previously privileged, lost her prominence and eventually she became a shadow of God in the form of man or father
 lekin hindu puranic kathaon main aisa nahin he
 Lakshmi can be seen performing Vishnu's footsteps, but she will not be insulted
 agar vah apamaanit anubhav karti hai, to vaikunth chhodkar ja sakati he or phir unhen manaakar waapas laane ke liye vishnu ko kathin parishram karnaa padataa he
 Shakti stands equal to Shiva and discusses with Shiva on the subjects of Vedas and Tantra
 vahaan upasthit rishigan shakti ke gyaan ko dhyaan se sunate hai
 Radha dances with Krishna but she is not his wife
 sita, jo apni pavitrataa siddh karne ke liye agnipariksha detii hai, parantu mahal kaa tyaag karne ke uparaant ayodhya waapas lautne se manaa kar detii hai
 Undoubtedly, feminists will also find episodes where goddesses are said to be relatively inferior to the gods in order to read Hindu mythology
 ramayana or mahabharat itihaas ke vibhinn kalkramon main saamaajik aachaar-vichaaron ko darshaate hai
 This gives us an idea of the ancient view of women in which they are portrayed as more sexually aggressive and unquenchable
 saamaajik vyavastha ko banaae rakhane ke liye unhen vivaah or maatrutiv ke madhyam se niyantrit kiya jaataa tha
 Even today our thoughts remain the same
 jo striyaan yon vishwaas se bharpoor hoti hai unke bare main yahi mat bana liya jaataa he ki aisi striyaan gharelu yaa ghar ke yogya nahin hotin
 It shows how much we are influenced by ancient ideas even in this modern age

 bijepi ne guuruuvaar ko congress se das sawaal kiye auranotbandiko deshhit main faisla bataate hue congress ko vikaas virdohi bataaya
 In its ten questions, the BJP surrounded the Congress on many issues including corruption, black money, income tax returns
 ye hai bhartiya janata party ke congress se das sawaal
 
 
 1
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sarkaar dwaara liye gaye faislon par congress har baar pradarshan kyon karti he, unhen kis baat kaa dar he?2
 Why is it that the Congress is not far from where there is black money? 3
 jis faisle ne tex ke base ko badhaayaa, us faisle kaa congress virodh kyon kar rahi he
 Is this not his political and anti-development thinking? 4
 How can it be that the former finance minister is surrounded by allegations of corruption and investigations are going on against him in many cases
 5
 Income tax returns have increased since demonetisation, yet Congress leader Anand Sharma stands in the Rajya Sabha and opposes it
 aisa kyon?6
 Poor and middle class people have benefited greatly due to demonetisation, is this the reason why Congress is opposing it? 7
 kya congress is baat se inkaar kar sakati he ki aaj desh kii jidipi bad rahi he, ez of duing bijness main ham aage bad rahe hai
 Is the Congress not happy seeing the economic progress of the country? 8
 hameshaa aisa kyon hota he ki jab bhi global level par bharat khadaa ho rahaa hota he, congress desh kii chhavi bigaadane kii koshish karti he?9
 Congress is talking about small scale industries today, but did they ever do anything for this sector under their rule? In his time there was only the fear of tax and red

 Can the Congress name any of its decisions that have taken action against black money and corruption? Surjewalene Modi has been attacked by the besieging Congress
 congress netaa randeep surajevaala par nishaanaa sadhate hue likhaa he, ''modi ji, deshavaasiyon ko ab tak ‘arthvyavastha tahas-nahas diwas’ yani notebandi kii duusari barsi kii badhai nahin di? koi vigyaapan bhi nahin? aap bhul gaye hoge lekin deshavaasiyon ko yaad he
 Be ready, the time for repentance is not far away! The public will avenge the demonetisation with the hurt of votes against the BJP
 ''surajevaala ne notebandi ko azaadi ke baad sabase bada ghotaalaa he
 He said that the black money holders' ash from demonetisation, overnight 'white' made all the cash
 na kaala dhan mila, naa naqli note pakade gaye, naa hi aatankwaad va naksalwad par lagaam lagi! Till yesterday, those who used to call each other good and bad in the electoral season, today the equation between them is telling a different story
 aam aadmi party ke netaa gopal raay kal tak congress ke menifesto par aapatti darj kar rahe the vahiin aaj congress ko patr likhakar us par dhyaan dene kii baat kar rahe hai
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Gopal Rai wrote a letter to Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday in which he raised several issues related to the Congress manifesto
 gopal raay ne likhaa ki congress party ne nyaay kii ghoshnaa kar har parivaar ko ₹12000 prati maah kii nunatam aay sunishchit karne kaa vaada kiya he lekin dilli ke log pichley kai dashakon se ghor anyaay jhel rahe hai or pichley 5 varshon main is anyaay ne sari simaaen laangh di hai
 Gopal Rai further wrote on the issue of full statehood that this topic is mentioned in the Congress manifesto, but your party's attitude on this matter is very disappointing
 patr main gopal raay ne 1991 se lekar 2014 tak purna rajya ke sangharsh kaa zikr karte hue tatkaaleen pradhanmantri narsingh raav, dilli ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri madan laal khurana, bijepi netaa laalkrishna adwani or purv raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii baton ko patr main ullekh kiya
 Rai wrote that the manifesto of the Congress stated that Puducherry would be given full statehood
 vahiin dilli ke bare main jo 3 baaten likhi gai hai usase aisa lagata he ki yah line jaldbaaji main or bina taiyaari ke menifesto main daal di gai hai
 It has been written in your manifesto that your party will amend the 1991 law of the GNCTD and will force the Delhi Cabinet's opinion on LG, except 3 cases
 yah vaastavik taur par sahi nahin he kyonki agar mantrimandal kii raay se alji ko baadhya karnaa he to samvidhan ke anuchhed 239 AA main sanshodhan karnaa hoga
 Gopal Rai, reminding of the old promise of the Congress, wrote that the Congress had promised to give full state to Delhi and now the Congress party has backfired
 dilli ke saath dashakon se hote aa rahe anyaay ko samaapt karne kaa ek hi tarika he ki samvidhan main sanshodhan kar dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja diya jaae
 Since 2015, when the people of Delhi chose their government with a historic majority , the Modi government has been taking revenge by electing from Delhi
 kya aap kalpana kar sakate hai ki dilli kii nirvaachit sarkaar ko ek chaparasi kaa tabadalaa karne kaa bhi adhikaar nahin he
 Rai said in the letter that what the elected government of Delhi, legislators and political activists have faced, they could not mention in this letter
 baharhaal, dilli main donon partiyon main gathbandhan par ab tak koi faisla nahin ho paaya he

 In the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections, the ruling BJP has not given ticket to its national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya from Indore district this time
 lekin unke bete akaash ko chunavi siyasat main utaar diya gaya he
 At the same time, BJP is also seen leaning in front of senior leader Babulal Gaur
 party ke netritv ne babulal gaur kii bahu krishna gaur ko tikat thamaya he
 Krishna Gaur will contest from Govindpura seat as BJP candidate
 bataa den ki babulal gaur govindpura seat se 10 baar vidhayak rahe hai
 This picture has been revealed in the third list of BJP candidates released on Thursday after heavy rage
 yah bahupratikshit fehrist chunavi namakan daakhil karne kii aakhri taarikh yani 9 november ke keval ek din pehle jaahir kii gai he
 Vijayvargiya has a record of winning 6 consecutive assembly elections from the year 1990 from different seats in Indore district
 vah varsh 2008 or varsh 2013 ke pichley do chunaavon ke dauraan jile ke dow
 Ambedkar elected from the Nagar (mhow) region and reached the assembly
 baharhaal, is baar bhaajapa ne mau seat se vijayawargeey ke sthaan par party kii pradesh ikai kii upaadhyaksh usha thakur par ummidavaari kaa bharosa jataayaa he
 Thakur was elected during the last assembly elections of 2013 from Area No
 3 of Indore city
 lekin is baar unhen apni puraani seat chhodani padi he, kyonki indore-3 se vijayawargeey ke bete akaash ko tikat diya gaya he
 Akash is going to contest the first election of his life
 gauratlab he ki vijayawargeey kii paramparaagat seat indore-do rahi he
 He also has ancestral residence in the same area
 lekin varsh 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main unhen yah seat chhodkar ummidavaari ke liye mau kshetra janaa padaa tha jo us vakt congress kaa majboot garh hua karata tha
 In 2008, when Vijayvargiya left Indore-2, BJP had relied on his old partner Ramesh Mandola as a candidate from this seat
 mandola, indore-do se varsh 2008 or 2013 ke do pichley vidhansabha chunaav jeet chuke hai or bhaajapa ne unhen is baar bhi isi seat se chunavi maidan main utaara he
 This time senior BJP leader Madhu Verma has been given the candidature for the Rau seat of the district
 is seat se pradesh congress ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jitu patawaari ne pichhlaa vidhansabha chunaav jeeta tha
 Patwari is the Congress candidate from the same seat in the upcoming assembly elections
 varsh 2013 ke pichley vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan congress jile kii kul 9 siton main se keval rau seat jeet saki thi, jabaki 8 anya siton par bhaajapa ne kabja jamaaya tha
 This time BJP has retained its outgoing mlas as candidates on a total of 6 seats in the district
 inamen indore-2 se ramesh mandola ke alaava depalpur se manoj patel, indore-ek se sudarshan gupta, indore-4 se malini goud, indore-5 se mahendra hardia or sanver se rajesh sonkar shaamil hai

 bihar ke mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhiko apni kursi bachaane ke liye ab floor test dena he
 Governor Kesrinath Tripathi has asked Manjhi to prove his majority in the Vidhan Sabha on February 20
 mana ja rahaa he ki bajet satr se pehle rajyapal ke abhibhaashan ke baad maanjhi ko ye mauka diya gaya he
 In the current political situation, Chief Minister Manjhi has few options left
 pehla mauka:maanjhi ke paas best opshan to yahi he ki wo vidhansabha main apana bahumat sabit karen
 Manjhi hopes that he will get full help of BJP in proving majority
 maanjhi kaa daawa he ki jediu or argedy ke 56 vidhayakon ke alaava bijepi ke 87 vidhayak bhi unka saath denge
 If Manjhi does this, he will also get the benefit in the coming elections
 vah daliton kaa maseehaa ban kar ubharenge
 Manjhi can then explain to the people that despite being right, there was an attempt to remove him from the Chief Minister's chair because he comes from the Dalit community
 doosraa mauka:vidhansabha main bahumat sabit na kar paane kii sthiti main maanjhi khud kii alag party bana sakate hai
 Under the banner of his new party, he can come to the election ground on his own and explain his point to the people
 teesraa mauka:maanjhi agar party banane ke baad bhi chunaav main akele nahin utarana chahen to unke paas duusare vikalp bhi hai
 If Manjhi wishes, like Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha, he can do pre-poll alliances with BJP
 chauthaa mauka: maanjhi ke liye agar chunaav purv gathjod sambhav na ho to chunaav baad bijepi yaa jo bhi badi party ho usase sarkaar main bhagidaari ke liye molbhav kar sakate hai – basharte unke paas is laayak sankhya bal ho
 Fifth chance: Manjhi has one more difficult option
 maanjhi chahen to gile-shikave bhulaakar nitish kumaar ke saath samjhauta kar len or mukhyamantri kii kursi phir se nitish ke hawaale kar den
 If he wants, he can also become Deputy Chief Minister or Cabinet Minister in Nitish's new innings
 yaa phir, apane sabhi samarthakon ke liye mantri pad kii maang rakh sakate hai
 Anyway, along with Manjhi, there are more number of supporters who want to become ministers

 ) The SAARC Conference in Kathmandu due to Pakistan's obstruction proved to be a flop shaw and there will no longer be a 'settlement ceremony' proposed by India among South Asian countries
 bharat ne prastaav diya tha ki saarc deshon ke bich behatar connactivity ke liye sabhi deshon ko sadak, rail margon or bijli ke jariye sampark badhanaa chahie
 This step could be helpful in taking trade relations between SAARC countries to a new level
 lekin, pakistan ne bhartiya prastaav kaa virodh kiya or maamla vahiin khatm ho gaya
 After this hurdle imposed by Pakistan, the distance between the two neighboring countries seems to have increased further and it can be said that the 18th summit of SAARC countries sacrificed the 'bitter' relationship between India and Pakistan
 ab yah tay kiya gaya he ki kisi bhi samjhaute par hastakshar nahin honge or isi ke saath pichley teen saal main pehali baar ikattha hue saarc desh bina kuch sarthak hasil kiye apane-apane ghar lautenge
 According to sources, the Indian side was disappointed by the Pakistan's blockade, which had initiated these proposals
 vaise bharat ne pehle hi saarc ke vibhinn sadsy deshon se dwipaksheeya sampark samjhaute karne shuru kar die hai or nepal ke saath mangalvaar ko hua motor vaahan samjhauta usee kaa ek udhaaharan he
 Prime Minister Modi said in his address that the dream i have seen for India, i also see for South Asia
 modi ne kaha, saarc deshon ke kareeb aane kii gati dhimi he
 Modi said, whenever we mention SAARC countries, i have to say with regret that we get to hear only two reactions, pessimism and skepticism, but we have to turn it into optimism
 piem modi ne kaha, ham (dakshin asian desh) sabhi paas-paas jarur hai, lekin saath-saath nahin hai, jabaki hamen samajhnaa chahie ki saath aa jane se ham sabaki takat kai guna bad jaaegi
 PM Modi said, if we can illuminate each other's villages and towns, then we can create a better tomorrow for our entire region

 yahaan tak ki srilanka main kam se kam do test match main ve sachmuch main dabadabe vaali sthiti main the or unhone virdohi team ko vaapasi kaa mauka diya

 a banquet was held on Thursday evening in which several big leaders of the NDA attended to calm the situation of confrontation that arose in the Bihar NDA ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 jediu ke taraf se mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, purv mantri shyaam rajak, bhaajapa kii taraf se upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi, kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad, kendriya mantri ramkripal yadav, kendriya mantri radhamohan singh or saansad bhupendra yadav, lok janashakti party ke taraf se kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan, saansad chiraag paswan, saansad ramchandra paswan tathaa rashtriya lok samta party kii taraf se party ke rashtriya kaaryakari adhyaksh naagamani shaamil hue
 The NDA banquet was attended by most of the mlas from all parties, state government ministers and district heads of all parties, including big leaders of the BJP and its allies
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki NDA ke is bhoj se kendriya mantri or rashtriya lok samta party ke adhyaksh upendra kushvaha nadaarad rahe
 It is believed that after Nitish Kumar's return to the NDA, Upendra Kushwaha is not being given that much preference in the alliance
 is baithak kii shuruyaat se pehle hi pichley 2 dinon se loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar bhaajapa gathbandhan kaa cheharaa or siton ke talmail ko lekar sabhi partiyaan bayaanbaji kar rahi thi
 It was expected that when the leaders of all the parties meet at the food table, all differences and differences will be removed by forgetting the differences
 lekin aisa kuch bhi nahin hua, hua to sirf bhojan or sirf bhojan
 Talking to Aaj Tak during the banquet, senior JDU leader Shyam Rajak reiterated his party's claim to contest 25 out of 40 seats
 shyaam rajak ne kaha ki jadyu kii 25 seat kii maang bheekh nahin balki unka haq he
 On the other hand, Chirag Paswan, chairman of Lok Janshakti Party's parliamentary board, also submitted his party's claim for seats
 chiraag paswan ne kaha ki pichley baar lok janashakti party ko 7 siten ladane ko mili thi or is baar usase kam par vah maanane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Chirag Paswan also objected to the jdu's decision to project Nitish Kumar as the face of the alliance in Bihar during the Lok Sabha elections
 chiraag ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav pradhanmantri chunane ke liye hota he or isi vajah se pradhanmantri narendra modi hi bihar main gathbandhan kaa cheharaa honge jinke naam par vot maanga jayega
 Angered by JDU, the Rashtriya Lok Janata Party had also made its intentions clear before the banquet and submitted a claim to contest 9 seats in the Lok Sabha
 bhoj ke baad ajtak se baatcheet karte hue rashtriya lok samta party ke rashtriya kaaryakari adhyaksh naagamani ne kaha ki is bhoj main unhen aakar niraashaa haath lagi
 Nagmani said that he hoped that there would be some talk about the crisis in the alliance and the coordination of seats during the banquet, but nothing happened
 naagamani ne bhi apni party ke taraf se nitish kumaar ke chehre ko aage karke loksabhaa chunaav ladane kii jadyu ke faisle ko sire se khaarij kar diya
 He said that Upendra Kushwaha is a bigger leader than Nitish Kumar in Bihar as his base is many times more than him
 naagamani ne kaha ki endie gathbandhan ko loksabhaa chunaav upendra kushvaha ke chehre ko aage karke ladanaa chahie
 Amidst a mutual tussle between the alliance partners, the BJP was busy conveying the message that all is well in the alliance
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki NDA gathbandhan puri tareeke se ekajute he or usamen koi bhi takaraav kii sthiti nahin he
 Meaning is completely clear, all the big leaders of NDA appeared on one platform together under the pretext of banquet but their hearts were not getting
 dilachasp baat yah he ki yah to abhi sirf trailor he, puri film abhi baaki he

 In the year 2015, the slogan on which Nitish Kumar won the assembly elections in Bihar has been changed slightly this time
 pichhali baar naaraa tha, 'bihar main bahaar he, neetishae kumaar he' is naare ko gadhane main chunavi ranneetikaar prashanth kishor kaa dimaag tha
 But Prashant Kishore has no role in the new change that has been done
 lekin saal 2020 main hone vaale chunaav ko lekar jo naaraa gadha gaya he vah he, 'kyun karen vichaar, thike to he nitish kumaar'
 The thing to be seen now is how much slogans work under changed circumstances
 lagaataar teen baar mukhyamantri ban chuke nitish kumaar ne pichhlaa chunaav argedy+jediu+congress ko milakar mahagathbandhan ke binar tale ladaa tha
 In which the vote bank of these three parties came to dominate BJP
 nitish kumaar isse pehle endie main the lekin narendra modi ko piem pad kaa cheharaa banaae jane par vah naaraaz ho gaye or bijepi se naata tod liya
 This is the new slogan of Janata Dal United
 bihar main bahaar hai neetishae kumaar hai prashanth kishor kaa dimaag tha 
 But he has nothing to do with this new slogan

 com / tjspohtrrilokasaba chunaav main to nitish kumaar kii party kii karaari haar hui lekin unhone lalu prasad yadav ke saath milakar bihar main modi kaa vijay rath roak diya tha
 This government lasted for about one and a half years, but after this the quarrel between JDU and RJD increased on corruption charges leveled against Lalu family and finally Nitish Kumar resigned from CM post to form government with BJP
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or jediu ne milakar argedy kaa supada saaf kar diya or lalu kii party ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai
 But now that relationship with BJP is not hot
 bijepi centre main prachand bahumat ke saath ai he or uske paas 300 se zyada site hai or use sarkaar main bane rahane ke liye kisi sahyogi kii jarurat nahin he yahi vajah he ki kendriya mantrimandal main jediu kaa ek bhi mantri nahin he
 JDU was also not with the Modi government on the issue of triple talaq and removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin agar bihar main bijepi-jediu or aljeepi saath milakar chunaav ladati he to teenon kaa votbank milakar baakiyon par baari padegaa

 The space in these coaches will also be more than the old ones, and these 'blow-proof' seats are also guaranteed to make the journey more convenient
 
 
 iske alaava krom ke khaase istemaal or mati kii bani satahon kii vajah se dibbon ko aisa luk mila he, jinhen dekhakar lagata he ki ve 'nae jamaane' ke hai
 
 
 Rameshchandra, general manager of West Central Railways told NDTV, “we have spent around Rs 14 lakh on each coach
 
 
 in dibbon kaa bhitari luk kisi bhi tarah aadhunik siton or anya suvidhaon se yukt vimaan se alag nahin he
 
 
 After that we will rewamp three more trains

 " It is planned that a total of 111 such coaches will be built in Bhopal workshop

 So, those blue or brown seats are now in the past, because the berths will look purple in these new coaches
 
 
 in dibbon main jagah bhi puraane vaale dibbon ke mukaable zyaada hogi, or in 'jhatka-pruf' siton se safar ke adhik suvidhajanak hone kii bhi puri-puri guarantee he

 west central railway (west Central Railways) ke general manager rameshchandra ne NDTV ko bataaya, "hamane prayek dibbe par lagbhag 14 lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 
 
 The inner look of these coaches is in no way different from an aircraft with modern seats and other amenities
 
 
 iske baad ham teen or trainon ko nae sire se rivamp karenge
 
 
 And as far as their inclusion is concerned, that will happen only after the approval of the Railway Ministry

 So, it is nice to know about these modern coaches
 
 
 mujhe is baat par fakhr he ki in aadhunik dibbon kaa nirmaan bharat main hi nahin, madhya pradesh main hua he
 
 
 " yojana he ki bhopal kii workshop main is tarah ke kul 111 dibbon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 
 
 The test of the 20 finished coaches has been successful, and after minor alterations and improvements, they will be sent to Delhi for approval by the Railway Ministry

 In Monday's episode, the householders became quite emotional in the task given for nomination
 ghar main din kii shuruyaat 'tohfa-tohfa laayaa-laayaa ' gane se hui
 At the beginning of the day, Monalisa was seen explaining to Manu the double attitude of talking to Lopamudra and Bani
 vahiin baahar baithe manu, manavir, bani or rohan main baaten chal rahi thi ki isi bich rohan ne bani ko task na karne ko lekar taana maaraa
 The comments big bos ne ghar main nomination kaa task diya jisamen gharavaalon ko daakiya banaaya gaya or sabhi sadasyon ke liye ek-duusare ke ghar se aae parcel the
 There were parcels from the house of Manu near Monalisa, Bani ka near Manu, Lopa ka near Bani and Monalisa near Lopa
 is task ke dauraan ghar main ek bhatti lagaayi gai
 In these tasks, the family had to put the parcel in the fire instead of giving it to the householder and protect themselves from nomination
 lekin yadi parcel us gharavaale ko de diya jaataa to parcel dene vaala sadsy nominete ho jaataa
 From the very beginning of the work, Monalisa became quite emotional and decided that she would nominate Manu's parcel and nominate herself
 is baat par manu unhen kaaphi samajhaate rahe ki vah nominete na ho or unka parcel unhen na den chaahe usamen kuch bhi ho
 But Mona was adamant and he nominated himself by giving the parcel to Manu

 Lopa became very unhappy after this because her parcel contained the letter of her sister
 aag main jalane ke baad bhi vah letters kuch batch gaya or lopa baad main use padhane kii koshish karte hue dikhin

 mana jaataa he ki paanch rajyon main vidhansabha chunaavon ko dekhte huye companiyaan sarkaar ke ishaare par aisa kar rahi hai
 According to a government official, if the situation remains the same, then the public sector oil companies will incur a record revenue loss of Rs 1,74,126 crore in the new financial year starting April

 If prices do not come down in the international market and retail sales prices in the domestic market remain at the current level, then the oil companies will have to bear the burden of this huge revenue loss

 Even companies on petrol 4
 50 rupee prati litre kii kam vasuuli ho rahi he
 Although the government deregulated petrol in June last year, but in view of the assembly elections in five states, the price of petrol remains indirectly under government control

 57 dollars a barrel, but then the government cut customs duty on imports of petroleum products and excise duty on production to reduce the impact of higher international prices on domestic prices
 is baar ke bajet main aisa kuch nahin kiya gaya

 a big plan is going on in the Sangh to connect such people with their mission
 yuvaaon ko unke profeshan se judi jimmedaariyaan saunpi ja rahi hai
 Like trained volunteers of the Sangh, they are also given importance
 sangh kii ore se aise yuvaaon ko prastaav diya ja rahaa he ki swayamsevak banane ki liye shakha main janaa hi jaruri nahin he, ve naukari se jab bhi fursat paaen to suvidhanusaar kuch ghante aresas ke anushangik prakalpon (project) ke liye nikaalen
 Thus, even if they do not go to the branch, they can join the Sangh and its mission and become a volunteer
 aresas kii sanghathan vistaar kii koshishon kaa nateeja he ki 2012 se june 2019 tak 6 lakh log sangh se online judane kii ruchi jaahir kar chuke hai
 1 in 2018
 5 lakh or 2019 ke chah maheene main hi 67 hajaar logon ne naam-pate ke saath online byora bharaa he
 a senior union official Aajtak
 in se kaha, " sangh rudhivaadee sanghathan nahin he, balki badalte parivesh ke saath khud ko usamen dhaalane vaala sanghathan he
 Whenever RSS felt, it changed from dress to belt
 haal main sangh ne paryaavaran, gram vikaas, gau sangrakshan, saamaajik samarasata or kutumb prabodhan jaisi chah nai gatividhiyaan shuru kii hai
 In the work of monitoring and monitoring these activities, such volunteers are being engaged who are knowledgeable about the subject
 chaahe ve enjio se judakar in kshetron main kaam kar rahe hon yaa phir anya kisi str se, sabhi ko aise prakalpon se joda ja rahaa
 "according to the plan prepared by the members association being formed in the committees, such people who do not go to the branch are being linked to the subsidiary organizations like Rashtriya Seva Bharti, Vidya Bharati etc
 swasthya, shiksha, graamy vikaas aadi se jude ek lakh se adhik prakalpon main aise logon kii madad lee ja rahi he
 These people are also being included as members in committees related to service works by the Union
 udhaaharan dete hue sangh ke varisht padaadhikari ne bataaya, 'agar koi peshey se shikshak he, magar vah kinhin kaarnon se sangh kii shakha main nahin ja paata to aise logon ko ham vidya bharti kii ore se sanchalit skulon se jodate hai
 They are made members in the committees of schools
 icchaanusaar ve skulon main svaichhik rup se padhaane kaa jimmaa le sakate hai yaa phir shikshan vyavastha kii manitoring kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 Similarly, if a doctor wants to join, then he is entrusted with the responsibility of health camps run by Seva Bharati
 kya kehete hai aresas vichaarkanagpur main rahane vaale aresas ke vichaarak dilip dedhavar Aajtak
 says in "time has changed, so the branch pattern cannot fit on every person of this age
" yah sangh bhi samajhataa he
 He considers himself not a cadre but a social organization
 golwalkar bhi kehete the ki hamaare kaaryakartaaon ko khud ke liye bhale 'rigid' hona chahie, dusron ke liye lacheela bananaa chahie
 Therefore, the Sangh also welcomes people from outside, who are helpful in advancing its ideology
 "devdhar kehete hai ki sangh sansthaapak keshav baliram headgavar se lekar golwalkar or balasahab devaras ke kaarykaal tak bahari vyaktiyon ko sangh main bade pad die jate the
 The tradition of advancing the Khanty volunteers continued in the middle
 magar ab phir se samaaj ke pratishthit vyaktiyon ko aresas apane prakalpon main sammanjanak dhang se jodakar saajha hiton ko vistaar de rahaa he
 Dilip Deodhar says that before the children did not go to coaching, they were available in the Sangh branches
 ab zyaadaatar bachche subah hi koching chale jate hai
 In private companies, a large section is forced to do the job of morning shift
 aise main sangh kaa maananaa he ki vichaardhaara se jude jo log 'shakha pattern' se khud ko nahin jod pate, unhen seva prakalpon se joda jaae
 So that they can join the mission of RSS
 isse unhen sangh kii vichaardhaara se linoup karne main aasaani hoti he
 Deodhar says people ranging from doctors, engineers, lecturers-professors to chartered accountants, big companies in corporate companies are also working in the same way as RSS volunteers do by joining RSS service projects

 hindu dharm main aisi manyata he ki sansar ko chalaane vaale prabhu kan-kan main vyaapt hai
 God exists in the infinite form in the world
 duniya ke paalanhaar prabhu kii ananthata kaa bodh karaane vaala ek kalyankari vrath he, jise 'anant chatudarshi' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 The Chaturdashi of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada month is called 'anant Chaturdashi'
 is din anant bhagwaan (srihari) kii puja karke baanh par anant sutara baandha jaataa he
 Devotees believe that wearing an infinite sutra protects them from all kinds of troubles
 saath hi har tarah se saadhakon kaa kalyaan hota he
 Mahatmya of Anant Chaturdashi is such a belief that this fast started from Mahabharata period
 jab pandav jue main apana rajya gavaankar van-van bhatak rahe the, to bhagwaan shrikrishna ne unhen anant chaturdashi vrath karne ko kaha
 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, along with his brothers and Draupadi, performed this fast to get relief from sufferings
 tabhi se is vrath kaa chalan shuru hua
 The devotees who observe the fast worship the form of Lord Vishnu or Shri Krishna
 anant swaroop chaudaa ganthon vaale anant sutara kii vidhipurvak puja karne or vrath kii katha sunne ke baad ise baahon par baandha jaataa he
 After the puja the Purusha Sutra is tied on his right hand, while the women tie on his left hand
 bharat ke kai bhaagon main is vrath kaa chalan he
 It is infinitely fruitful if you fast with full faith
 anant chaturdashi kii pujan vidhi:anant chaturdashi ke pujan main vratakarta ko praat:snaan karke vrath kaa sankalp karnaa chahie puja ghar main kalash sthapit karnaa chahie, kalash par bhagwaan vishnu kaa chitra sthapit kerani chahie iske pashchaat dhaagaa len jis par chaudaa ganthen lagaaein is prakaar anantsutra (doraa) taiyaar ho jane par ise prabhu ke samaksh rakhen iske baad bhagwaan vishnu tathaa ananthasutra kii shodashopchaar-vidhise puja kerani chahie tathaa anantayanam: mantra k jaap karnaa chahie
 After worshiping, after reading the Anantasutra Mantra, both men and women should tie the infinite sutra in their hands and listen to the fast-story after worship
 ananthasutrabandhne lene ke baad brahman ko bhojan karana chahie or swayan sapariwaar prasad grahan karnaa chahie
 The mantra to tie the infinite sutra is like this: Ananta Sansar Mahasamudremagnam Sambhyudhar Vasudeva
