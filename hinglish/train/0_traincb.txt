 On April 23, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah were voting in their parliamentary constituency in Gujarat, Sufi singer Hansraj Hans was cut out of the ticket of Udit Raj, the current MP and Dalit face of the party in Delhi
 udit raaj kaa maamla charchaa main aata, isse pehle hi punjab ke gurdaspur se film abhinayta sani deol ko bhaajapa ne apana pratyaashee ghoshit kar diya
 Deol joined the BJP a few hours ago
 der shaam tak hoshiyarpur se bhaajapa ke ek or dalit chehre, kendriya rajyamantri vijay saanpala kaa tikat bhi cat gaya
 These three incidents on the same day gave rise to the discussion inside and outside the party (opposing parties) that BJP is no longer a party cadre, defiant and celebrity favorite
 isse bhi badhkar yah charchaa bhi garam ho gai ki aakhirkaar bhaajapa kaa dalit virdohi cheharaa ujagar hone laga he
 Congress General Secretary
 si
 Says Venugopal, "now the issue has become clear that the central government and the BJP are anti-dalit
" bhaajapa ko daliton ke vot to chahie lekin unhen majboot kad ke dalit netaa pasand nahin hai
 The BJP wants to eliminate such leaders politically
 " tikat se vanchit bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''kader aadhaarit party hone kaa daawa hamaara netritv sirf dikhaave ke liye karata he
 When the time comes to nominate the cadres, it is known that someone had taken a celebrity ticket
 " shahanvaj hossain, kirit somaiya, krishna raaj, ashok dhode, udit raaj, vijay saanpala jaise darjanon naam hai jinhe party ne haashie par dhakel diya
 His question is, "people like Gautam Gambhir, Sunny Deol, Ravi Kishan, Nirhua, Hansraj Hans, Kiran Kher get tickets
" kya ye bhaajapa ke kader hai?"haalanki bhaajapa ke rashtriya pravaktaa or rajyasabha saansad jiviel narsingh raav kaa daawa he, ''party ne 438 ummidavaar is baar chunaav main utaare hai
 Most of these candidates are the ones who have been associated with the party for years
 yah baat sahi he ki kuch aise logon ko bhi tikat mila he jo celebrati hai lekin party apana vistaar to karti hi he
 We include people from different walks of life in the party, it is not a wrong thing
 " jiviel ke in daavon ke baad bhi sachaai yah he ki bhaajapa main darjan bhar se adhik aise logon ko pratyaashee banaaya gaya he jo yaa to dalbadalu hai yaa phir celebrati
 Sujay Vikhe from Congress, Jai Panda from BJD, Balabhadra Manjhi from BJP from BJD, Anupam Hazra, Soumitra Khan, Arjun Singh, CPI-M Khagen Murmu from Congress, a from Congress 
 manju, umesh jadhav, devendrappa, di
 K
 aruna jaise logon ko bhaajapa ne pratyaashee banaaya he
 All these leaders are those who joined BJP just a few months ago
 unhen tikat dene ke liye party ne un kaaryakartaaon ko darkinar kiya jo varshon se sakriy hai
 That is why the issue of neglect of the question-makers has started to arise in the party because the BJP has made it clear that the face of Modi is only in the 2019 elections
 pratyaashiyon par focus karne kii sakht manaahi he
 bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar says, "the issue of this election is Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 pratyaashee koi bhi ho, log vot modi ke naam par de rahe hai
 In such a situation, there is no need for a face other than Modi
 " udit raaj (ab congress netaa) kehete hai, ''yadi aisa hi he to phir gautam gambhir, ravi kishan, nirahua, sanni deol ko pratyaashee banane kii jarurat hi nahin he
 In his place, a cadre, a district or divisional president of the party could be made a candidate
 sahi baat yah he ki bhaajapa kaa maujuuda netritv kisi majboot netaa yaa jameen se jude dalit netaa ko panpane hi nahin dena chahta he
 "however, a Dalit leader associated with the BJP says," The party firmly made inroads into Dalits in 2014
 unke saath khaanaa khaane se lekar unhen chunavi manch or sanghathan main tavajjo di gai
 "by the way, the party continued to run such programs till the elections to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki dalit utpeeda ke khilaaf jab desh bhar main dalit aakrosh bhadkaa to dhire-dhire party ne daliton se kinaaraa karnaa shuru kar diya
 When the BJP faced defeat in the elections of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and the BSP-SP came together in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP probably felt that the Dalit voters would not come with the BJP
 uske baad hi party main dalit saansadon kii andekhi shuru ho gai
 In 2014, BJP won 40 out of 84 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and 27 out of 41 seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes
 is baar in 67 saansadon main se bhaajapa ne 34 saansadon ke tikat kaat die
 What is the strategy? The strategists of the BJP believe that after a long time the party has reached the point that there is no universally accepted leader of any caste or class
 ek samay party main kalyaan singh lodh netaa, gopinath munde pichde netaa, calraj mishra, tarakant jha jaise brahman netaaon kaa barchasv hua karata tha
 The resentment of these leaders means that the caste they belong to could have offended the BJP
 lekin modi-shah kii jodi ne party ke andar is mathadhishi ko tod diya
 In such a situation, if a leader like Udit Raj or Sampla had set an ambition to establish himself as the Dalit face of the party, then it became necessary for the party to curb it
 rahi baat 37 anasuchit jati or janajati saansadon ke tikat katane kaa to unki jagah jinhen pratyaashee banaaya gaya he, ve bhi sabhi unheen jatiyon ke hai
 Party strategists claim that the anti-incumbency trend was against those whose tickets were cut
 celebrati ko tikat dene ke peeche ek vyaavhaarik makasad yah he ki jeetne vaale pratyaashee ko tikat diya jaae
 In the seats where the BJP is not strong, leaders from other parties have been given tickets
 jo netaa duusari party chhod kar bhaajapa main aae hai, unhen tikat dena galat nahin he
 Right now, the truth between the bjp's strategy and the question being raised about the neglect of the party cadre is that the atmosphere seems to be building in the name of Modi, but the atmosphere can be made worthy of winning the seat only if the face (candidate) is also strong especially In places where a strong leader stands out from the rival camp
 party ke andruni sutara daawa karte hai ki bhaajapa yahi kar rahi he chaahe uttar pradesh main apni seat bachaane kii jaddojahad ho yaa phir pashchim bengal yaa odisha jaise rajyon main camel khilaane kii manshaa
 Now it has to be seen, this strategy of the party is effective, neglect of cadres is heavy for it

 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kaa rajya kii sadakon ko lekar kiya jane vaala har daawa lagaataar charchaa main rahaa he
 Shivraj has claimed many times that the roads in Madhya Pradesh are no less than the US
 1 agast ko bhi ek kaarykram ke dauraan shivaraj singh ne apni baat ko doharaate hue kaha ki main ek baar phir kahata hum ki madhya pradesh kii sadaken america se kam nahin hai
 Just 3 days after Shivraj's statement, a statement shared on the social media by the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister's Office seems to be mocking the Chief Minister's statement in the morning
 soshal media par madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri karyaalay kaa bayaan ab viral ho rahaa he
 In fact, on August 4, a post was posted by the Twitter handle of the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister's Office, in which the state government read the praises of the vaccination campaign
 lekin isse shivaraj sarkaar ke raaj main madhya pradesh kii sadakon kii pole khul gai
 In a post posted on the Twitter handle of the Chief Minister's Office, Madhya Pradesh has achieved 100% success in # missionindradhanush of vaccination with vaccination by health department team up to 3 remote villages including Kharayani, Sukhwaha of Chhatarpur
 
 sadaken na hone se team 10 kimi paidal, naav se jangal va anya baadhaon ko paar kar pahunchi
 The hashtag of New India has been put at the end of the post, but in the same New India claim, the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister's office also told how the vaccinated employees were 10 km on foot due to lack of road, then a path through the forest
 Had to reach inaccessible village
 yani madhyapradesh main aise gaanv bhi hai jahaan tak jane ke liye sadaken hi nahin hai or karmchaariyon ko paidal chalanaa padaa
 Guess how much happiness the roads in the area of the people of that area would have enjoyed in the last one and a half decades under the rule of Koshivraj Singh
 phir bhi shivaraj kehete hai ki madhya pradesh kii sadaken america se behatar hai
 Is there any place in America where there is no road on the lines of Shivraj's rule? rajasthan ke kukhyat gangster anandapal singh kaa guuruuvaar ko antim sanskaar kar diya gaya

 Lady Dawn Anuradha Chaudhary has done MBA and belongs to a large family of Jaipur

 Submerged in the stock market, after a lot of money sunk in the stock market, a lot of debt went up
 paison kii tangi ke baad anuraadhaa choudhary gangster anandapal ke gang main sakriy bhoomika main aa gai or dekhte-dekhte hi vah aparaadh jagat kii duniya main chaa gai

 In June 2016, Anuradha was arrested from Jaipur
 anuraadhaa ke pakade jane kii kahani bhi kam dilachasp nahin he
 If he did not pay extortion money, he was kidnapped
 Actually once a businessman of Sikar did not give extortion money to Anuradha, she was kidnapping him and bringing him to his hideout
 police ko isaki bhanak lagi or raste main hi anuraadhaa ko pakad liya gaya
 He has since been lodged in Jaipur's Central Jail

 According to sources, after Anandpal got involved in gang, the job of planning from court-court to crime also remained on Anuradha due to his good education

 Currently, after the death of Anandpal, the responsibility of the gang has come on Anuradha, but the way the Rajasthan Police is intent on ending the miscreants, it seems that running this gang will be very challenging for Anuradha

 dwarka peeth ke shankaracharya swami swaroopanand se sawaal poochna ek patrkaar ko mahangaa pad gaya
 As soon as a journalist in Jabalpur asked Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand, who was the better PM in Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal? This enraged and slapped the journalist
 aapako bataa den ki swami swaroopanand do peethon ke shankaracharya hai- dwarka peeth or jyotish peeth
 Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati gave a clarification after the video appeared in Swami Swaroopanand saraswatimedia
 unhone kaha, 'ek aadmi ne hamase poocha modi ke bare main
 We slapped one
 maine lagaaya thappad
 We told him that you are talking to bring that man into the discussion
 raajnneetik log is tarah ke hote hai ki chaahe buraai karo
 Whether they should be praised should be discussed
 ' swami swaroopanand saraswati ne kaha, 'modi chune jaaen
 Become Prime Minister, we have no objection lekin vah sahi-sahi janata ko bataaen ki vah kya chaahate hai
 'congress has come to the rescue of Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati in the case of slapping journalist in Jabalpur
 congress is baat ko maanane ko taiyaar nahi he ki swaroopanand ne thappad maaraa he
 On the other hand, BJP says that there is no such expectation from Dharmacharyas
 madhya pradesh ke congress netaa maanak agarwal ne kaha, 'sadhu-santon se rajnatik sawaal nahi karnaa chahie dharmik sawaal karnaa chahie
 i think it should be avoided
 kabhi-kabhi dharm se hatakar sawaal puche jane se gussa aa jaataa he
 Swaroopanand ji does not get angry
 aa gaaya hoga
 Said in love
 rajnatik sawaal nahin karo
 Did not slap
 'duusari taraf madhyapradesh bijepi ke pravaktaa hitesh vaajapeyi ne kaha, 'dharm, niti, satya ke dhvaj vaahak hote hai dharmacharya or kshamaa ke pratik hote hai

 The answer is definitely important
 ' Fraud from OLX website, accused arrested with money to sell arrestee after Delhideal had taken both money and car
 Faradilli police have arrested two persons named Mahtab and Akeb who under the pretext of selling Fortuner car through OLX website 4 from one person
 65 lakh rupee lut liye
 According to the police, the complainant Sultan informed that he is graduating from Hyderabad
 vah OLX par ek lagjri car kii talash kar rahaa tha
 He said that in August 2019, a Toyota Fortuner car advertised on olx was priced at 6 lakhs
 car kii delivery ke liye bulaayaa dilhiusne kaha ki vigyaapan main die gaye number par watsap kol ke jariye mehataab naam ke shaks se sampark hua
 Price 4 after bargaining
 65 lakh rupee tay hui
 The accused asked the complainant to come to Ajmeri Gate in Delhi with money to take delivery of the car
 3 sitambar 2019 ko shikayatakarta apane teen bhaaiyon ke saath ajmeri get, dilli aayaa, jahaan voaropee or uske doston se mila
 About 2 after this
 15 lakh rupee nakad die or baki rupee bhi transfar kar die
 When asked about the delivery of the car, the accused Mahtab told the complainant that he would get the NOC of the car the next day
 aaropee paise va car le hue faraarphir mehataab, shikayatakarta or uske bhaaiyon ko pahadganj ilaake ke ek hotel main le gaya
 However, on the morning of 4 September, when the complainant and his brother were sleeping, the accused and his friend fled the hotel with the car
 iske baad kamala market police stesan main dhokhadhadi kaa maamla darj kiya gaya
 During the investigation, CCTV cameras installed at Ajmeri Gate and the hotel in which they stayed were examined by taking footage, in which the photographs of both the accused were found by the police
 jaanch ke baad yah pataa chalaa ki donon aaropee meerut (upi) ke nivasee hai
 Accused arrested, Fortuner car also seized
 After this, a member of the police team was sent to his village to confirm the identity of the accused where it was found that they were there
 iske baad police team maukey par pahunch kar donon hi aropiyon ko unke gharon se pakad liya
 Also, a Fortuner car registered in the name of Mahtab's uncle was also seized
 donon aaropee vyaktiyon se lagaataar poochtacha kii ja rahi thi, jisamen unhone khulaasa kiya ki ve meerut main krishi kaary main lage the
 They want to contest the panchayat elections, for which they needed money
 haalanki, krishi se unki aay paryaapt nahin thi
 So they were looking to make easy money
 is bich mehataab ke chachaa ne unhen bataaya ki vah apni fortuner car bechnaa chaahate hai or unase ek upyukt kharidaar kii jarurat he
 Both the accused accused in judicial custody took it as an opportunity to earn big bucks to contest the elections
 unhone car kii tasveeron ko oelex website par aplod kiya or car kii bikri ke liye bahut sasti raashi bhi rakhi
 As the complainant showed his interest to buy the car, he called him to Delhi as part of his plan and after receiving the entire amount, pretended to give the car the next day and after having dinner with the complainant in a hotel, they left from there in hours Run away donon aropiyon ko nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya he
 The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has decided to break away from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) alliance
 party paulitabeuro ne sarvasammati se yah faisla liya he
 The TDP has accused the BJP of doing injustice to Andhra Pradesh
 bataa den ki andhrapradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja nahin die jane ke kaaran tidipi ne endie se apana samarthan waapas liya he
 TDP MP YS Chaudhary said that soon the official information will be sent to BJP
 saath hi tidipi ne aaj loksabhaa main avishvaas prastaav pesh karne kaa elaan kiya he
 On TDP withdrawing support from NDA, BJP leader GVL Narasimha Rao told Aaj Tak that it is a political propaganda under which efforts are being made to prove that the central government is doing nothing for the state
 unhone kaha ki yah rajya main apane vajood ko bachaae rakhane ke liye apanaaya gaya raajnneetik propeganda he
 It will not have any effect on the BJP
 guuruuvaar ko centre sarkaar ne andhra pradesh ke liye vishesh sahaayta ke taur par 12,476
 76 crore was announced to be released
 isamen se 2500 karod rupe nae rajdhani shahar ke liye rakhe the
 However, the TDP has consistently reiterated that the Center has done injustice to Andhra Pradesh and has not kept its promises
 tidipi kaa kahana he ki centre sarkaar rajyasabha main die aashwaasano ko puraa karne main naakaam rahi he
 In the Rajya Sabha, the PM assured Andhra Pradesh special status
 party kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke saath gathbandhan isliye kiya gaya tha taaki andhra pradesh ke saath nyaay ho sake, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Andhra will not get special status Earlier, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that Andhra Pradesh will be given special package only on the basis of special status
 kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha tha ki andhra pradesh ko special states dene ke vishay main mukhya baat yah he ki kisi rajya ko special states kyon diya jaataa he? jetali ne kaha ki finance kamishan ke mutabik mahaj north-east ke rajyon ke liye special states kaa praavdhaan he kyonki unke paas apane khud ke sansaadhan behad simit hai
 What is in front of the center was the problem, said that the Fourteenth Finance Commission removed the provision of special status for the states
 lihaaja ab is aadhaar par andhra ko special states kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the Central Government and the State Government decided that Andhra Pradesh would be given a special package based on the formula of 90-10% for 5 years
 lekin andhra ko ab special states kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa he
 Drang Assembly seat of Mandi district in Himachal Pradesh is a strong stronghold of Congress
 drang himachal kii aisi seat hai, jahaan se pichley aath chunaav se congress ke netaa kaul singh lagaataar jitate aa rahe hai
 But this time the electoral nature of Drang has changed
 congress pratyaashee thakur kaul singh ke khilaaf is baar unke hi raajnneetik shishy chand thakur ne congress se baghawat karke taal thonk rakhi he
 This is the reason why the political battle of the Drang assembly has become interesting
 kaul singh congress ke kaaphi kaddavar netaa maane jate hai
 He was a contender for the post of Chief Minister in the Congress several times, but due to Virbhadra Singh, he did not win the game
 kaul singh ko raajnneeti main ek baar 1990 main bijepi ke deenanath shastri ke haathon shikast mili thi
 Since then Aaj Tak has not beaten them
 kaul singh ko drang ke vikaas kaa maseehaa kaha jaataa he
 Despite being Himachal's largest and most difficult assembly constituency, Thakur Kaul Singh exercised his political stature and left no stone unturned in the development work here
 yahi vajah he ki ye seat congress kaa abhed durg bani hui he
 The political equation of the Drang assembly seems to have changed this time
 kaul singh ke raajnneetik shishy ke siyaasi maidan main unke hi khilaaf utarane se wo ghire hue najar aa rahe hai
 His biggest problem is his own political disciple Purna Chand Thakur, who despite being the vice-president of the state Congress at present, has rebelled and got into the fray
 duusari ore pehali baar yahaan bhaajapa bhi ekajute ho gai he
 In the last assembly election, Kaul Singh won by a margin of only 2232 votes
 aise main purna chand thakur kaa baagi hona or bijepi kaa ekajute hona kaul singh thakur kii pareshaani ko badha rahaa he
 BJP has once again placed bets on Jawahar Thakur, who has lost the election twice
 jabaki unke party main virdohi rahe ramesh sharma va brigadier khushhaal thakur bhi is baar saath aa gaye hai
 The notable thing in the context of Jawahar Thakur is that he is the least educated among the candidates in the fray in this election
 ve maatr nauveen paas hai
 But for a long time being active in politics are well-known names among the public
 kaul singh kaa mukhyamantri pad par daawa nahin rahaa kyonki saat aktubar keemndi raily main rahul gandhi manch se virbhadra singh ko mukhyamantri pad kaa daavedaar ghoshit kar diya
 Apart from this, one problem of Kaul Singh is that this time his supporters have also got tickets in the district
 wo sabhi apane apane kshetron main vyast hai
 The responsibility of registering victory lies on his own shoulders
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki kaul singh itihaas rachate hai yaa phir bijepi unke durg main bhed karne main safal hoti he
 Many criticisms surfaced on social sites against a mocking statement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday

 'but till date Mamta ji has not sent both these things to any of our leaders

 So you can understand that she knows the size of the kurta
 pehle ham sawaal uthaate the ki unki chaati kaa aakaar 56 inch he yaa nahin
 Let me tell you that in a non-political interview given to actor Akshay Kumar two days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that Mamta Banerjee sends him two kurtas and sweets every year
 piem modi ne kaha tha ki yahaan tak ki bangladesh kii pradhanmantri shaikh hasina ne bhi mujhe khaastaur par dhaka se ek saal main teen-chaar baar mithai bheji
 When Mamta Didi came to know of this, she too started sending sweets to me once or twice a year
 pradhanmantri ne intervyuu menkaha tha ki raajnneetik virodhiyon jaise varisht congress netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ke saath unke achche sambandh hai
 On Akshay's question whether he donated the entire amount received as salary during his tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat before going to Delhi? Modi said, "this is not completely true
 main aisa karnaa chahta tha, lekin mere andar kaam karne vaale kuch adhikariyon kii salaah par maine keval 21 lakh rupee kaa daan diya
 i asked the officials to spend on the education of children of junior staff in the Secretariat
 "yah puche jane par ki kya unhone kabhi gussa mahasoos kiya he? modi ne kaha, 'agar maine kaha ki mujhe gussa nahin aata, to logon ko hairaani hogi
 "he said," Anger is a part of every human's life

 Kaur, who is also seeking ticket from Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat, alleged that the Chief Minister has claimed that he is able to get the Congress 13 parliamentary seats of the state on his own
 unhone amritsar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha tha ki captain sahab or aashaa kumari sochate hai ki madam siddhu (navjot cor) saansad kaa tikat paane ke yogya nahin hai
 i was not given a ticket from Amritsar on the grounds that i would not win because of the train accident in Amritsar on the occasion of Dussehra (in which 60 people were killed in October last year)

 Purna Prakash, the head of the family, approached the police to human rights against the decision of the Patwa community, but even today a family is different from its own society
 gaya kaa patwatoli mohalla jo powerloom kii aawaaj se goonjata rahata he lekin inhen awaajon main ek parivaar kii sisakiyaan dab jaati hai
 Purna Prakash's family is not even living in this locality even today
 darasal unhone apane purvajon kii jameen ko patwa samiti ko dene se manaa kar diya tha
 The incident is of 1998 when Purna Prakash not only refused to give the land of ancestors but also approached the court
 tab se puraa patwa toli purna prakaash ke parivaar kaa purna bahishkaar kar rahaa he
 Not giving the land of his ancestors to the committee, the Patna society went through so much anger that his family was expelled from the caste
 is parivaar se pichley 18 varshon se patwa jati ke logon ne baat nahin kii, mohalle ke dukandaaron ne rashan nahin diya
 Children cannot buy toffee here

 But they can trade only with other castes
 ye sirf duusari jati ke logon kaa kaccha maal kharidte hai or bechate hai
 For the last 18 years, the family that has suffered this stigma has complained about it from the police station to human rights, but nothing came out
 purna prakaash bataate hai ki hamaari jati main shaadi bhi isi mohalle main hi hoti he
 i was also married

 Even if met on the way, negotiations are banned

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while replying to the discussion on the President's address, has taunted the Congress without taking names
 unhone kaha, aapaki oonchai aapako mubarak ho
 You have gone so high that the ground has stopped appearing, uprooted from the roots
 ' piem modi ne kaha ki hamen kisi kii lakeer kii chota karne main apana vakt barbaad nahin karte hai
 During the speech, PM Modi said on the statement of Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary that some people say why we have not sent 'so-and-so' to jail, there is no emergency in the country to send anyone to jail
 kanoon apane hisaab se kaam karegaa or jin logon ko jamaanat mil rahi he vah anjvaaye karen

 PM Modi, referring to the Emergency, again targeted the Congress and said that today is 25 June
 25 june kii taarikh ke din desh kii aatma ko kuchal diya gaya tha
 Who imposed the emergency? kya ham us din kaale din ko bhuulaa sakate hai
 Before this, PM Modi started the discussion, Dr

 PM Modi said that democracy in India is not born out of the pages of the Constitution, but democracy in India is our soul for centuries, that soul was crushed

 After the Central Planning Commission has set an absurd standard of poverty, there has been a lot of anger all over the country about stomach food
 lekin uttar pradesh police abhi bhi hiraasati vyakti ko pichley ek dashak se paanch rupee main bhar pet bhojan kara rahi he
 The Central Planning Commission recently set an absurd standard of giving rich status to the daily spending of Rs 27 in rural areas and Rs 33 in urban areas
 iske baad congressi netaaon ke bayanon ke baad samooche desh main bhojan ko lekar garibi or amiri ko paribhaashit karne kii bahes chhid gai he
 It is worth mentioning that Raj Babbar had said about 12 rupees, Rashid Masood five rupees and Union Minister Farooq Abdullah for one rupee full meal
 congressi netaa rojaanaa kitne rupee main pet bharte hai, yah to ve khud jaane, par talkh sachai yah he ki desh ke kisi bhi hisse main netaaon ke rate par bhar pet bhojan nahin miltaa or uttar pradesh kii police pichley ek dashak se, hiraasat main liye gaye vyakti ko paanch rupee ke sarkari maanak main bhar pet bhojan kara rahi he, or isi maanak ke anusaar soobe kii sarkaar bhugtan bhi karti ai he
 However, even in this five rupees of food, the police keeps playing, because the food of the person who is locked in the hawks of most police stations is made by his family
 banda ke apper police adheekshak swami prasad ke anusaar, ek dashak purv, hiraasat main liye gaye vyakti ke bhojan ke liye shashan se sirf do rupye prati khuraaq kaa praavdhaan tha, baad main manhagaai ko dekhte hue yah rakam badha kar paanch rupee kar di gai he
 The amount is made available to the station in-charge
 swami prasad kehete hai, 'aaj aasmaan chhu rahi manhagaai ko dekhte hue yah dhanrashi oont ke munh main jira bhi nahin he, lekin ek dashak se is dhanrashi main koi ijapha nahin kiya gaya
 'he says,' Even good tea is not available for five rupees from the hotel, but how will the police provide a full meal for five rupees? You can guess 'bisanda ke thanadhyaksh pankaj tiwari kaa kahana he, 'vaise to hiraasat main liye gaye aasapaas ke gaanvon ke vyaktiyon ke bhojan kaa intjaam unke parijan hi karte hai, yadi dur-daraaj kaa vyakti pakadaa gaya to sipaahiyon kaa pet kaat kar bhojan dena majaburi hoti he
 According to him, the district officials pay the name of the same person, who is produced in the court
 jabaki aksar aise bhi vyakti hiraasat main liye jate hai, jinhen jail nahin bheja ja saktaa or unke pet kaa prabandh apni jeb se karnaa padataa he
 a reporter met Rinku alias Sankalp, a young man under consideration in Tendura village, who was lodged in Banda jail, to know the reality of food in police custody
 usne bataaya ki use chaar din naraini police kii hiraasat main rahanaa padaa tha
 The police did not provide food for a single day
 tisare din uske parijan khaanaa lekar pahunche, tab kahin bhukh miti
 Regarding the amount paid in the name of this young man arrested in the case Crime No
149 / 20013, the counter-inspector (RI) posted at Police Line Banda informed that the Naraini Police has been paid only Rs
15 per three doses
 ab is yuvak ke maamle se saaf jaahir hota he ki sthaneey police ne use ek baar bhi bhojan nahin diya or uske naam par mili 15 rupee bhi hajam kar gai

 Giving old examples, the government said that in the past too, no leader was given the status of Leader of the Opposition in the absence of the required number of times
 1980 se 1989 tak loksabhaa main koi vipaksh kaa netaa nahin tha
 Some senior leaders even told journalists that when the people did not consider the Congress to be the leader of the opposition, why should they be given this status
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bhartiya janata party ko sabase zyada apratyaashit nattejey pashchim bengal se mili
 The party won 18 of the total 42 seats here
 yah wo rajya he jahaan bijepi ne avaidh rup se rah rahe ghuspaithiyon kaa mudda jor-shor se uthaaya
 In particular, accusing BJP President Amit Shah Mamata Banerjee of patronizing infiltrators, he has been repeatedly claiming claims of expelling intruders from Bengal when the Modi government comes back
 ab jabaki amit shah ko modi sarkaar main grih mantralay kii jimmedaari mili he, to kya bengal main ghuspaithiyon ke bure din shuru ho jaaenge? ghuspaithiyon ko baahar karne ke liye bijepi bengal main rashtriya naagarikta panjikaran (enarasi) lagu karne kii baat kahati rahi he, jabaki pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee khule taur par iskaa virodh karti rahi hai
 Even the face-to-face rhetoric in the NRC issue Mamata Banerjee and the BJP leadership was seen
 chunaav prachaar main bijepi ne ghuspaithiyon ko baahar karne kaa vaada kiyapradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah milakar enarasi ke jariye ghuspaithiyon ko bharat se baahar karne kii hunkaar bharte rahe hai
 Addressing a gathering in Siliguri, Bengal, PM Modi assured the refugees of neighboring countries of justice, saying that the Gorkha community in North Bengal will not be harmed by the National Register of Citizens (NRC) but at no cost to the intruders Will be spared

 com / 7wl00myotd — Aaj Tak (@aajtak) June 1, 2019 Before PM Modi, Amit Shah had said in a meeting in Alidwarpur that if the BJP came to power at the Center, the Modi government would implement the National Civil Register (NRC) in Bengal and Will drive all intruders out of the state
 mamata banerjee ko gherte hue shah ne kaha tha ki mamata banerjee sochati hai ki unhen ghuspaithiyon se chunaav main madad milegi
 If the Modi government comes to power, we will bring NRC in Bengal, every intruder will be identified and eliminated
 saath hi shah ye bhi kehete rahe hai ki hindu va buddha sharnaarthiyon ko desh chhodane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Explain that NRC has been implemented in Assam
 30 july 2018 ko enarasi jari kiya gaya tha, jisamen kul 3
 Out of a population of 30 crore, 2,89,83,677 people were included in the Citizenship Register
 inamen jo log chhot gaye the, unhen phir se is prakriya main shaamil hone kaa mauka diya gaya he
 The same NRC is being talked about in Bengal and it is being claimed to eject infiltrators from Bangladesh
 amit shah chunaav prachaar ke dauraan aksar bengal main ghuspaithiyon kaa masalaa uthaate rahe hai
 At the same time, it has also been said that any Hindu or Buddhist refugees who have come from outside, will be respected while the other intruders will be selected
 jabaki mamata banerjee kahati rahi hai ki enarasi ke jariye bijepi bengal main hindu or muslim ke bich matbhed or nafrat paidaa karne kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin vah ise safal nahin hone dengi
 In such a situation, after getting the responsibility of the Home Minister of the country, what steps Amit Shah takes in this direction, it will be interesting to see

 No matter how much people criticize the hypocritical babas in India, it will be rare that they will not give up on seeing the ocher or other religious clothes
 par haal ke varshon main jis tarah se kai chote-bade, asli-nakli yani har kism ke baba vivaadon main ghire hai, usase khatka hone laga he ki kahin ham adharmyug kii dehri par paanv to nahin rakh rahe
 From the illegal possession of land, to murder, to unnatural sex, to prostitution racket serious charges have been leveled against religious leaders
 shaayad hi koi dharm in pravritiyon se pare rah paaya he
 Allegations of doing business and raising money in the name of religion have become a thing of the past
 yahaan tak ki pratishthit kathavachak or shankaracharya kii gaddi par baithe mahanubhaavon kaa daaman bhi in chhinton se nahin batch paaya
 In such a situation, the believer's mind asks, on whose side should the sheesh be made, and from whom should he redeem his body
 sant kabir to kehete the—kabir aap thagie or na thagie koy—lekin yahaan to pataa hi nahin chal rahaa ki thag ne sadhu kaa vesh dhar liya he yaa sadhu hi thag ho gaye hai
 And the biggest irony is that even the saints are being mashed with wheat in the face of these hypocrites
 farvari, 2010 main jab shivamurti dvivedi urf ichhadhari baba chitrakoot vaale ko police ne dakshin dilli ke posh ilaake se deh vyapaar ke aarope main dabocha to logon kii shraddha ko kuch aisa hi jhatka laga tha
 Six call girls and two brokers were also present with the baba who performed aarti and dance
 ramcharita maanas ke rachayita tulsidas kii karmbhumi chitrakoot se apana naata bataane vaale is thag ne raisjadon ke liye ladkiyaan suplari karne ke liye sadhu kaa chola odha tha
 This Baba is grinding a mill in Tihar jail today
 uski is harakat ne puure sadhu samaaj kii chhavi ko kalankit kar diya
 Similarly, in January 2011, a very interesting but embarrassing case came up in Vrindavan, the land of Gopeshwar Krishna
 ek mahila police ke paas pahunchi ki use computer thik karne vaala dukandaar blackmel kar rahaa he
 The woman was the wife of Rajendra Sharma, a local young narrator from here
 jab police ne maamle ko khodna shuru kiya to pataa chalaa ki kathavachak dampati kaa nijee computer kharaab ho gaya tha or unhone ise sudhaarney ke liye ek dukandaar ko diya tha
 Ram knows how much the computer person improved the computer, but he found many such movies in which the narrator and his wife had video clippings converging in different postures
 ye filmein mathura or vrundavan ke vibhinn ghaaton or sthanon par filmai gai thim
 These were all such holy places that by the name of the man, there is a belief that a man can go beyond the ocean
 lekin yahaan to babaaji ghaaton ko hi taar rahe the
 There was a lot of respect in the clippings even if there were only husband and wife, there were animals from the minor children to the animals of the vagina
 maamla ujagar hua to dharm dharaa main bavaal much gaya
 Police seized movie cameras, cds, several hours of video films of Baba with children, wife and some foreigners from the narrator
 farji sadhu par aprakritik yon sambandh banane kii dhara 377 or ity act kii dhara 67bi ke tahat maamla darj kiya gaya
 The sage fraternity was tarnished by a handiwork of Baba and the outside world noticed that the movement to arrest Baba was conducted by the Sadhu Samaj of Vrindavan
 or sachche saadhuon ke bich is farji aadmi kii koi haisiyat nahin thi
 The iconic Swami Nityananda of South India has previously suffered a scandal after an objectionable video with an actress went public
 dharm kshetra main punap rahi is nai samskruti ke bare main haridwar ke baba hathyogi kehete hai ki har bhagavadhari sadhu nahin hota
 Society should be alert towards hypocrites
 is sawaal par ki pichley kuch varshon ke dauraan kai pratishthit baba sex scandle, hatya or property vivaad jaise maamalon main fanse hai or khud haridwar main ek dashak main kai mahanton kii hatya property vivaad ke kaaran hui he, hathyogi ne kaha, ''jahaan tak sex scandle kii baat he to main itnaa hi kahuunga ki yah kamajori bahut puraani he
 Sex is the basic need of man and there are very few monks who can control it

 In the scriptures, there are many stories of ascetics falling in love
 lekin tab ke sadhu in sambandhon ko chhupate nahin the
 Today's sages do not have the strength to admit their weakness, so when their stories come out, they become scandals in your language
 ”haridwar, rishikesh or kaashi jaisi dharmanagariyon main kai mandir, math saadhuon kii sharansthali rahe hai lekin dharmanagariyon main kaliyug kaa pravesh nahin hua ho aisi baat nahin
 In Rishikesh, where the Ganges Ghats end, there is the Ghat of Baba Mastram on one side and the Chaurasi Kutiya on the other side
 in donon jagahon par aapako aise baabaaon kii toli mil jaaegi jinka aadhyatm chilam ke dam se aage nahin jaataa
 Their first priority is the Firangi women, who are seen to be tightening the chillum in a very intimate way
 aabaadi se jaraa dur hone ke kaaran baba mastaram ke ret ke ghat par videshi sailaani dinabhar sulapha or ganje kaa dam lagaate rahete hai
 According to local people, the slums built around the Chaurasi hut are actually outposts of the illegal drug trade
 sailaaniyon ke is tarah ke swabhaav ke bare main parmarth niketan ke swami chidanand saraswati kehete hai, ''hamaare ashram main badi sankhya main videshi shradghaalu aate hai
 If you study the whole routine yourself, then nothing but yoga and meditation will be seen here
 ashram main nasha pratibandhit he
 "they warn calmly," "the last two decades have brought a lot of wealth in the field of religion
" isaki ek vajah to yah he ki dharmapremi jan dharm kaa prasar karnaa chaahate hai
 But hypocritical monks are busy making money from such people
 yah shraddha kaa shraadh he
 One has to be careful with this
 ” kaashi main bhi sadhu-sanyasiyon ko andeh kii najaron se dekha ja rahaa he
 "in Varanasi, there are a large number of babas who establish physical relations with foreign women," says Bharath Acharya Todpe, a pilgrim priest
 ” unka daawa he ki ''kaashi ke assi ilaake ke kuch gerua vastradhariyon kaa to kaam hi videshi mahilaon ke saath shaareerik sambandh bananaa he
 "is the increasing grandeur in the lives of ashrams and babas and the money flowing like water not a reason for the sage mahatmas to be involved in wrong activities? On this question, Chidananda Saraswati says that where there should be divinity, there is grandeur coming
 sukh-bhoga itnaa kareeb aane ke baad man ke sanyam kii khidakiyon ke pat khulne main zyada vakt nahin lagata
 Sadhus should be aware of this
 saraswati bataate hai, ''kuch saal pehle kisi channel ne aise saadhuon kaa sting kiya tha jo blike mani ko white karte hai
 Those people also came to me but i refused
 sting ke saath mujhe or un saadhuon ko bhi dikhaanaa chahie tha jo galat kaam ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 Truth cannot be shown in pieces, it is a whole

 The ritualistic approach to Kashi is now being decided by way of hotels and lodges

 sinha bataate hai, ''chaar logon ke do kamare main teen din thaharne or ek vyakti kaa janeu sanskaar kaa package 20 se 25 hajaar ru
 Stays between yajmaanon ko ab phayda yah he ki internet se hi apni booking karakar package chun sakate hai
 This does not make them wander in Kashi
 ”kaashi main badi sankhya main nakli pande bhi karmkand kara rahe hai
 Bharu Acharya, the priest priest of Varanasi, says that people belonging to the Ganga-like castes like Mallah, Nishad, Nai caste are also performing rituals by taking the form of pandas
 karmkand se jude logon kii koi nigaraanee sanstha na hone se aise logon par najar rakh paanaa sambhav nahin he
 This is the reason that the rates of performing rituals along the Ganges are also different

 5,000 to Rs
 liye ja rahe hai
 Todpe says that cases have also come to light in which the Yajmans have complained to the elders of Kashi about cheating at the hands of pandas in exchange for rituals
 vaise kai baar sadhu bhi shikaar ban jate hai

 iske baad chennai ne shandaar vaapasi karte hue royal chalangers bangalore ke usee ke ghar main haraaya lekin agle hi match main kochi ne apane ghar main khelte hue dhoni kii team ko buree tarah parajeet kiya
 The Mumbai Indians have done the right thing

 Chennai have many big star players but so far, not everyone has tried to win their team together
 ek-do khilaadiyon ne apane prayaas se team ko do muqablon main jeet dilaai he
 In the three matches in which this team has lost, some players have also done commendably, but to continue the journey ahead of their reputation, this team will have to play as a unit in every match

 The BJP is repeatedly calling for slanderous attacks on Gandhi's ideology and thinking by its leaders

 It is an unforgivable crime
 desh ke shaheedon or mahaan vibhootiyon kaa apmaan bhaajapai samskruti ban gai he
 He said that earlier modi-amit Shah's favorite Pragya Thakur had committed the unforgivable crime of cursing his family, calling the 26 / 11 terrorist attack martyr Hemant Karkare ji a traitor
 uski ummidavaari waapas lene ke bajaay modi ne tivi saakshatkaaron main pragna thakur kaa bachaav kiya tha
 In the same year, on the 71st Bapu Day of Bapu, an organization of the Sangh committed the grave sin of reprinting Bapu's murder

 Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Union Minister Uma Bharti, the prominent face of the Ram Mandir movement, asked 'ram devotees' on Wednesday to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi's suggestion that consideration of the demand for legislation for temple construction should be judged
 Can only be done after completion
 kendriya mantri kii yah tippanee aise samay main ai he jab vishwa hindu parishad ne jor diya he ki mandir nirmaan kaa maarg sirf kanoon laakar hi prashast kiya ja saktaa he or hindu anantkaal tak pratiksha nahin kar sakate
 Let me tell you that on Tuesday, an interview of PM Modi was broadcast on the news agency ANI, in which he said on the issue of Ram temple construction that the ordinance will be considered only after legal process
 uma bharti ne twit kar kaha, 'pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ek vyapak saakshaatkaar diya he jisamen ram mandir kaa mudda bhi he
 All Ram devotees should agree to this
 ' unhone kaha ki modi kii tippanee mandir nirmaan ke maarg main roda nahin atakati he kyonki vibhinn samoohon se baatcheet ke jariye mandir nirmaan kaa vikalp khulaa he
 Uma Bharti has appealed to opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee to help the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the temple construction
 unhone twit kiya, 'mandir kaa nirmaan kathin hone ke saath-saath saral he
 If all political parties agree on it in the same way as for the construction of the Somnath temple, then nothing can be better

 The husband of a woman traveling in the jaipur-mysore Superfast Express tweeted 45 times for help to the Minister of Railways Piyush Goyal, but when he did not get help, he wrote angry saying that you had better Suresh Prabhu who helped in time

 pareshaan jyoti ne ye baat pati mohan ko bataai
 After this, Mohan tweeted from the Twitter account to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal 45 times continuously for 6 hours
 iske baavjood unhen koi madad nahin mili
 He kept searching for TC in the train for many hours but he could not find any railway personnel
 isse naaraaz hokar mohan ne piyush goyal ko twit kiya ki, "aapse acha management to purv rail mantri suresh prabhu kaa tha
 If he were a minister today, my problem would have been solved
 "iske kai ghante baad railway kii neend khuli or unhone twit kaa riplai kiya
 However, it has not been confirmed whether the woman's problem was resolved or not
 maaloom ho ki purv rail mantri suresh prabhu twitor ke jariye yatriyon ko madad pahunchane ke liye mashhoor hue the
 It may be a matter of delivering milk to the girl in the moving train, to provide treatment for the elderly or to curb the movements of the people
 ek twit par suresh prabhu kii madad pahunch jaati thi
 His Twitter campaign had benefited many travelers
 yahi nahin, puraa railway amala bhi twitor par hardam nazren jamaaye rakhata tha
 After Piyush Goyal became Railway Minister, many such cases came up in which the help sought on Twitter did not reach the people
 uttar pradesh main 20 fisadi alpsankhyak cote par roak ko lekar yogi ke do mantri aamane-saamne aa gaye hai
 While the Minister of Minority Affairs gave a statement of ban on quota, Social Welfare Minister Ramapati Shastri has ruled out the quota on minority quota
 kota khatm karne kaa koi prastaav nahinpahale alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantrimohsin rajane kota khatm karne kii baat kahi to ab samaaj kalyaan mantri ramapati shastri ne isse inkaar kiya he
 He has said that there is no proposal to abolish the quota
 somvaar subah alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri mohsin raja ne kota mukti kaa naaraa lagaaya to shaam hote-hote samaaj kalyaan mantri ramapati shastri ne roak se inkaar kar diya
 The quota of minorities started in 2012, Akhilesh Yadav government made a provision of 20% quota for the minorities in 85 schemes
 akhilesh sarkaar kii yojanaon main alpsankhyakon ko kota dene kii shuruyaat 2012 main hui thi, jiske tahat pradesh sarkaar kii 85 yojanaon main alpsankhyakon ke liye 20 fisadi kota nirdhaarit kiya gaya
 The major quota in minorities in major departments is in social welfare and village development
 jin kshetron main kam se kam 25 pratishat aabaadi alpsankhyakon kii hoti he, vahaan yojanaon ko sakhti se lagu kiye jane ke nirdesh hai
 Minorities are getting the benefit of quotas in major departments like Health, Public Works, Irrigation, Energy, Small Scale Industries, Khadi Village Industries, Panchayati Raj and Medicine
 akhilesh sarkaar kii kai yojanaon par yogi kii kanchisiem banane ke baad se hi yogi adityanath ne akhilesh sarkaar kii kai yojanaonko khatm kar diya he
 In the same episode, there was now speculation about abolition of minority quota on the statement of a minister
 bina adhyaksh ke chal rahaa he kendriya alpsankhyak ayogdesh ke kai rajya jahaan alpsankhyakon ke liye bichhe ja rahe hai, vahiin upi main alpsankhyakon ke liye laai gai pichhali sarkaar kii kai yojanaayen khatm kii ja rahi hai or desh ke alpsankhyak ayog kaa to pichley teen maheenon se sirf naam hi rah gaya he
 It seems that the Minorities Commission of India is also running on Ram's faith
 upi ke siem adityanath yogi ne to saaf kar diya he ki alpsankhyakon ke liye lagu pichhali sarkaar kii kai nitiyon ko gundosh or upyogita ke aadhaar par khatm kiya jayega
 It is a matter of the Minorities Commission of the country that since March, the Commission has neither a chairman nor any member
 sirf ek iees afasar sachiv hai jo arase se medical live par hai
 If we talk about the minorities then who? 
 According to the sources of the commission, the UPA government on the go made Nasim Ahmed the chairman of the Minorities Commission for three years
 march 2017 main naseem ahamed kaa kaarykaal khatm ho gaya
 The new chairman has not yet arrived

 In Islam religion, Roza is very important during Ramadan
 ramajaan ke puure garmi bhare maheene bhukhe-pyaase rahanaa or vakt par namaaz adaa karnaa
 Eat sehri on time and take iftar at the right time in the evening
 ramajaan kaa ye puraa maheenaa muslimon ke liye bahut khaas hota he, lekin rajasthan ke ek shaks ne apana rojaa sirf isliye tod diya kyonki ek mahila ko khun kii zaroorat thi
 Donating and helping the poor is considered good in the month of Ramadan, but the occurrence of fasting for a needy has seen very little
 darasal, rajasthan ke alvar main ek pregnent mahila ko khun kii sakht zarurat thi
 This man named Ashraf Khan showed humanity and broke his fast to give blood to the woman
 ramajaan kaa aakhri jumma, jaaniye id se pehle kaise manaai jaati he Jamat ul-vidataimsa of india ke mutabik savitri devi naam kii is garbhvatee mahila kaa haemoglobin bahut lo tha, ise tunrat khun kii zarurat thi
 According to Ashraf Khan, "I got a message on the phone that a man needs blood of the blood group immediately for his sister-in-law
" maine turant us aadmi ko phone kiya or kaha ki main shaam ko iftaar ke baad aa jaaunga, lekin us aadmi ne mujhase kaha ki doctor ne jitna jaldi ho sake khun maanga he, kyonki uski saali pregnent he
 "then what was Ashraf Khan immediately reached the hospital and he broke his fast by giving blood to the woman and saved her and her child's life
 jama maszid main bana bhandare kaa khaanaa, namaaz adaa kar rojedaaron ne shiv bhakton ko khilaayaa prasad Comedians like Sunil Grover, Ali Asgar left the Kapil show after a flight feud between Kapil Sharma and his team

 But it seems that the reason for Chandan's distance from the show is not the quarrel of the flight but something else

 Now that the 2014 Lok Sabha elections have come to a close, the political picture of Bihar has a thick fog
 harek party apane-apane daawey kar rahi he, lekin gathbandhan ko lekar apane pattey kholane ko taiyaar nahin he
 The reason is that all coalition partners are exploring new possibilities by breaking their traditional and established images
 nae saal kii shuruyaat ke saath hi bihar main rajnatik virdohi bhi ek-duusare kii tarif karte dekhe gaye, jabaki deshbhar main dhalaan kii ore badhati dikh rahi congress ke prati lalu prasad yadav jaise unke rajnatik samarthakon kaa prem aaj bhi barkaraar he
 With whom all the other parties will join hands except the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it is difficult to say
 virodhabhas kaa alam barkaraar he
 Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Ram Vilas Paswan was seen by both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad
 algepi bina koi seat jite 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main maatr 6
 It was able to garner 55 percent of the vote
 usne 12 loksabhaa siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 Paswan has made it clear that he is unhappy with the fact that there are very few seats left for the LJP in the RJD
 paswan takneekee rup se abhi tak argedy ke saath hai
 The LJP has expressed its desire for an alliance with the Congress, not expressing any dealings with the JD (U)
 agar in teenon kaa gathbandhan hua to algepi ko bihar main nayaa jivan mil saktaa he
 On the question of alliance, Paswan has done the trick and tried to avoid any kind of commitment
 tabhi to unhone faisla congress par chhod diya he, jise 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sirf 2 siten mili thim
 If Paswan has put the ball in the court of the Congress, then Lalu Yadav, who is watching the boom in his political future, is also ready to take any step to keep the Congress happy
 asal main bijepi akeli party he jise bihar main koi bhram nahin he
 There may or may not be a consensus on two seats with Upendra Kushwaha of the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party of the saffron party, but it has to clearly compete with the other four major parties — RJD, JD (U), LJP and Congress
 argedy or jedy (you) donon paswan se haath milaane ko taiyaar hai
 The JD (U), on the other hand, has indicated nearness with the Congress
 paswan ko bharosa he ki bhale hi chunaav ke pehle ho yaa na ho lekin chunaav ke baad centre main bijepi ko sarkaar banane se rokane ke liye bihar main secular partiyaan ek saath ho jaaengi
 The interest in the Congress, which has seen a steady slope in Bihar, is because its allies can expect to get more minority votes
 bihar ke ek varisht congressi netaa kehete hai, ''musalmaan jaanate hai ki teesraa morcha bas bhram he
 In such a situation, the Congress is the only party that can prevent Narendra Modi from becoming Prime Minister
 isamen koi hairat nahin he ki muslim un partiyon ko vot denge jo congress ko samarthan detii najar aaengi
 16 of Bihar
 53 fisadi kii muslim aabaadi us party ko variyata de sakati he jo bijepi ko rashtriya str par haraane kii kshamta rakhti ho
 Lalu is trying hard to get the support of Congress, but there are many problems in building unbreakable alliances at the ground level
 udhaaharan ke taur par argedy netaa abdul baari siddiki madhubani seat congress ke liye chhodia nahin chaahate
 He stood second in the 2009 elections after bjp's Hukumdev Narayan
 unhen congress ke shakeel ahamed ke 1,11,420 vot ke mukaable 1,54,165 vot hasil hue the
 Similarly, former Union minister and RJD leader Taslimuddin wants to fight Kishanganj from where Mohammad Anrarul Haque of Congress is a MP
 lalu ko khagadipha seat chhodie main bhi pareshaani hogi jahaan se pichley loksabhaa chunaav main argedy ke rabindra rana ko 1,28,208 vot mili the jabaki congress ke mehboob ali kaisar ko 1,27,493 vot
 Ironically, the Congress lost its electoral relevance in Bihar years ago, yet the two biggest alleged secular Lalu and Paswan are in the hope of an alliance with the same
 tathy bhi isi badi vidambnaa kii ore ishaara karte hai
 In the 1985 Lok Sabha elections, Congress won 48 seats in unified Bihar
 us samay bihar main kul 54 loksabhaa siten thim
 After the bifurcation of Bihar in 2000, there were 40 Lok Sabha seats left
 congress ko 2004 main teen or 2009 main sirf do siten milin
 In 2014, his condition might have become even thinner if BJP had not fielded Narendra Modi
 bihar main chunavi ganit badal chukaa hai
 Nitish is no longer invincible after splitting from the BJP
 2009 main jedy (you) or bijepi ne milakar chunaav ladaa tha or 40 main se 32 siten hasil kar lee thim
 Similarly, Lalu Yadav and Paswan want to join the Congress plan, while in 2009, both of them had left only three seats for the Congress
 jab congress ne is bantwaare ko sweekaar nahin kiya to argedy ne un teen siton par bhi ummidavaar utaar die the
 The Congress then spoiled the equation of both candidates by dropping the seats and the BJP-JD (U) alliance won a landslide victory
 pichley hafte log us samay hairaan rah gaye jab 20 janvari ko nitish ne paswan ke prati ekatarfa garmjoshi dikhaai
 Describing his old love for Paswan in the Janata Durbar, he said, "paswanji is a good man
 main 2004 or 2005 main unase gathbandhan karnaa chahta tha lekin kinhin vajahon se sambhav nahin ho sakaa tha
 Nitish's love for Paswan is a sudden change in his diplomacy
 nitish ne pichley 9 saal main algepi ko kamjor karne kii har koshish kii thi
 In May 2005, when Nitish was slightly away from the majority, he incited Paswan's rebel leaders in his favor
 loksabhaa chunaav ke turant baad 2009 kii shuruyaat main algepi ke ekmaatr emelsi sanjay singh ne nitish sarkaar main party ke vilay kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Sanjay, once a very close leader of Paswan, is currently a JD (U) spokesperson
 november, 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main algepi ko kaaphi nuksaan hua or usne sirf teen siton par jeet darj kii
 Two of them mlas later joined the JD (U)
 july, 2011 main jedy (you) ne paswan ke teen emelsi ko party main shaamil kar liya
 Nitish weakened them by creating a Mahadalit Commission and inducting all other Dalit castes into Mahadalit except Paswan's caste
 isse nitish ne adhiktar dalit jatiyon kaa vot hasil kar liya or paswan sirf apni jati ke netaa banakar rah gaye
 The very next day after praising Nitish, Paswan also thanked him, saying, "I thank Nitish Kumar for his warmth and good words towards me
" ham puraane dost rahe hai
 "but Lalu also called Paswan a true human being
 unhone kaha, ''hamaare paswanji ke saath badhibia sambandh rahe hai
 We are in touch and will form an alliance
 '' duusari ore paswan apane pattey kholane se pehle congress ke kadam kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 a senior LJP leader says, "congress has to decide whether the secular coalition in Bihar will have RJD or JD (U)
" ham congress ke saath hi jaaenge

 Yogi Adityanath said that "we have to focus on cleanliness in Uttar Pradesh
 sabase pehle hamen plastic ke istemaal main kami kerani hogi
 If our cities are clean then we will have fame in the world "
 meerut ko swatchta survey main 339waan sthaan mila he
 
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki meerut main die gaye apane bhaashan main mukhyamantri yogi ne safai par vishesh jor diya
 The comments isse pehle yogi meerut kii malin basti sher gadhi gaye, jahaan 41 varshiya devendra ne yogi ko bataaya ki siver naa hone se gandagi kii samasya bani rahati he
 Devendra told NDTV that "we told Yogi ji that there is no sewer, the drains get blocked in the rain, due to which dirty water gets accumulated
 
 We have a lot of trouble
 " media ko ummid thi ki malin basti main yogi lakhanu kii tarah jhaadu laga sakate hai, isliye subah se mediakarmi obi vine or camera lekar tainaat rahe, lekin yogi malin basti main logon se milakar nikal gaye

 First we have to reduce the use of plastic
 agar hamaare shahar saafe honge to vishwa main hamaari khyaati hogi"

 devendra ne NDTV ko bataaya ki "hamane yogi ji ko bataaya ki siver nahin hone se barsaat main naaliyaan jam ho jaati hai, jis vajah se ganda pani jamaa ho jaataa he

 The first voice is heard by Sonia Gandhi
 sonia gandhi:do rajya or ! mujhe koi aashcharya nahin hota agar jeetne kii khabar koi detaa to jarur jhatka lagata
 Shashi Tharoor: That is the point of thinking that we are constantly losing and they are winning continuously, what is different in their strategy? Where is the shortfall in our leadership? Salman Khurshid: Mr
 Tharoor, you have started to see big shortcomings in our leadership, assuming you are a South Indian but you are going right
 badi tarifen ho rahi hai aajkal ‘unki’

 ab saare kiye-karaae par pani pher ke ab unke saath jane ko taiyaar baithe hai

 Sonia Gandhi: Modi barely went there, held two-four rallies, gave development speeches and you were there twice, did not do any work by connecting with land in all these years? Madam used to work only, ask Vadra ji, he has done with him only

 Hooting happens in front of the Prime Minister, even if you are defeated, give reasons, tell me what you have to say, i will not do all this now

 - party ko sheersh netritv par puraa bharosa he,do rajyon main party kii haar ke liye rahul gandhi kii jimmedaari nahin banati
 People wanted change in Haryana so we lost
 - saidhantik taur par party vijayi hui he
 - There is no Modi wave
 bijepi ko maharashtra main purna bahumat nahin milanaa bataata he ki janata ko ab tak un par bharosa nahin he
 - Allies like NCP cheated otherwise we would never lose
 - haryana main haarane ke baad ham bhale satta main na rahen par ‘jameen’ se jude rahakar kaam karenge 
 - We will review the reasons for the defeat

 dilli sarkaar ne november ke pehle hafte main dilli sankhyikee pustika-2011 pesh kii or pustika ke aankadon ne kuch aisa samaa baandha ki dilli duniya kaa sirmaur shahar najar aane laga
 In the juggling of statistics, there was a surge of prosperity and progress in Delhi
 lekin jin aankadon ke dam par dilli ko tarakkee kii tasviir sabit kiya ja rahaa he, unki jameen kuch khaas majboot nahin dikhti
 For example, according to the statistics book, the number of buses in Delhi is 61,471, while Chief Minister Sheila Dixit herself has been claiming for a long time that private and public sector buses in the city have to somehow reach 11,000, so that the common man can get in and out
 Have a chance pustika ke mutabik dilli main 88,181 auto rickshaw panjikrut hai
 While the fact is that under the Supreme Court order, the maximum number of auto rickshaws in Delhi can be 55,000
 supreme court ne pustika aane ke kareeb 10 din baad ek lakh nae auto jodne kii manjuuri di he
 Statistics of buses and auto rickshaws are the hallmark of statistics booklet
 pustika ke mutabik is samay shahar kii aabaadi 1
 68 crores
 lekin maje kii baat dekhie ki yahi pustika bataati he ki shahar main tivi dekhne waalon kii sankhya 2010 main hi 1
 8 crores, while Doordarshan's viewership is 1
 7 karod he
 That is, about two million more people are watching television than the city does not have a population
 lekin is tarah ke aankadon ko darkinar karte hue pustika jari karte samay mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne badi hui prati vyakti aay or mobile conection kii badi hui sankhya ko aage karte hue shahar ko vikaas ke pratik ke taur par pesh kiya
 Dixit said, "delhi has become the third richest city in the country
 dilli teji se shahari swaroop dhaaran kar rahi he or beete ek dashak main yahaan gramin aabaadi main 55 fisadi kii giravat ai he
 Number of mobile connections in FY 2010-11 as an example of rapid urbanization
 88 karod tak pahunchane ko bade aadhaar ke taur par pesh kiya gaya, jabaki shahar kii aabaadi 1
 68 crores
 yani dilli main har do aadamiyon ke paas ausatan paanch mobile phone conection hai
 But the statistics book did not bother to find out how many of these connections are in operation, as it is a well-known fact that Delhi's mobiles keep on changing mobile sims very rapidly in terms of mobile company's tariff packages and their needs

 On November 14, on the occasion of the departure of the new cluster buses, Lovely said, "by the year 2013, Delhi government will be operating 11,000 buses
 inamen se 6,000 basen cluster basen hongi
 “that is, the government has a target of running 5,000 buses of DTC and 6,000 buses of private sector companies in Delhi by 2013
 maje kii baat yah he ki puraani condom bason ko milakar is samay ditisi ke paas 6,204 basen hai or inamen se bhi mahaj 4,330 basen hi rojaanaa sadak par utar paati hai
 That is, in the case of transport, the statistics of 61,471 buses is nothing but far-fetched
 parivahan vibhaag ke varisht adhikari ne kaha, ''parivahan vibhaag ab bhi dashakon pehle panjikrut hui bason ko bhi apane record main darj kiye he
 That is why this number looks so big
 ''sankhyikee pustika ke aankadon par tippanee karte hue pradesh bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh vijendra gupta ne kaha, ''shila dikshit kii sarkaar apni peeth thokane ke liye aankadon kaa sahaara le rahi he, jabaki hakeekat isse koson dur he
 The Congress government has not been able to provide houses to the poor despite increasing population under the rule of 13 years
 rajeev ratna awaas yojana ke tahat ek bhi garib ko makaan muhaiyaa nahin karaayaa gaya
 Not a single colony has been regularized out of 1,639 unauthorized colonies
 ''pustika ke hisaab se dilli main 33,79,956 awaason main se 3,77,790 awaas khaali pade hai
 That is, 10 percent of the houses are lying vacant in a city where many people are forced to sleep on the pavement
 ab sarkaar ko yah koun bataae ki aankadon kii marichika se sachaai kii pyaas nahin bujhti
 It would be better to cook the data on the truth
 bijepi kii mukhar netaa uma bharti ne aaj kaha he ki narendra modi atal bihari vaajapeyi jaise achche vaktaa nahin hai
 BJP candidate from Jhansi Uma Bharti said, 'vajpayee was a good speaker
 log kehete hai ki bhartiya raajnneeti main unke jaisaa vaktaa koi nahin hua
 If you listen carefully, you will find that Narendra Modi is not a good speaker
 log narendra modi kii reliyon main unako sunne nahin aate, balki yah bataane aate hai ki ve unase desh main badlaav chaahate hai or ve unke saath hai
 ' gauratlab he ki vaajapeyi sarkaar main soochna evam prasaaran mantri evam khel mantri rah chukin uma bharti saal 2005 main bijepi se nikaal di gai thim or tab se hi vah narendra modi kii kaaphi tikhi aalochana karti rahi thim

 The question is whether the BJP will get a mandate like 2014 on the basis of the functioning of the Modi government, or will it be able to take advantage of its electoral advantage by creating an atmosphere against the Congress government, or will the public reject the two major parties and their alliances, respectively, by rejecting the NDA and the UPA
 Will find an alternative? The correct answer to this question will be found only in May, when the EVM machines will open after the voting and the mandate will come out, but before that, Aaj Tak has learned the mood of the country through Karvy Insights and find out how many votes to which coalition in different parts of the country And how many seats are expected to be available

"

 With that logic: In Hinduism, Muhurta is definitely seen before doing anything auspicious
 darasal, manyata he ki kisi bhi shubh kaary se pehle panchang jarur dekhnaa chahie
 Panchang can be called an ancient Hindu calendar
 panchang paanch ang shabd se bana he
 We call it almanac because it is made up of five major organs
 wo paanch pramukh ang hai- nakshatra, tithi, yoga, karan or waar
 Which day is auspicious and how inauspicious, it is known through these five organs
 aaie jaanate hai panchang ke mahatv or iske paanch angon ke bare main
 
 
 These are the five parts of the almanac
 nakshatra-panchang kaa pehla ang nakshatra he
 According to astrology, there are 27 types of constellations
 lekin muhoort nikaalte samay ek 28waan nakshatra bhi gina jaataa he
 It is called Abhijeet Nakshatra
 shaadi, grah pravesh, shiksha, vaahan kharidi aadi karte samay nakshatra dekhe jate hai
 2
 tithi-panchang kaa doosraa ang tithi he
 There are 16 types of dates
 inamen poornima or amavasya do pramukh tithiyaan hai
 Both these dates definitely come once a month
 hindi calendar ke anusaar maheene ko do bhaag main baanta gaya he, shukla paksh or krishna paksh
 The period between Amavasya and Poornima is called Shukla Paksha
 vahiin poornima or amavasya ke bich kii avadhi ko krishna paksh kaha jaataa he
 By the way, it is believed that no big or important work is done during Krishna Paksha
 aisa isliye kaha jaataa he kyonki is samay chandramaa kii shaktiyaan kamjor pad jaati hai or andhkaar haaavee rahata he
 So therefore all auspicious works such as marriage are decided at the time of Shukla Paksha
 3
 Yoga is the third part of Yoga-almanac
 yoga kisi bhi vyakti ke jivan par gaharaa prabhaav daal sakate hai
 There are 27 types of yoga considered in the almanac
 iske kuch prakaar he- vishkumbh, dhruv, siddhi, variyaan, paridhi, vyaghaat aadi
 4
 karan-panchang kaa chauthaa ang karan he
 Half of the date is called Karan
 mukhya rup se 11 prakaar ke karan hote hai
 Of these, four are fixed and seven change their place
 bav, baalav, taitil, naag, vaanijya aadi karan ke prakaar hai
 5
 waar-panchang kaa paanchavaa ang waar he
 The period between one sunrise to another sunrise is called war
 ravivaar, somvaar, buudhvaar, brihaspativaar, shuukravaar, or shanivaar, saat prakaar ke waar hote hai
 Among these, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are considered auspicious

 ' rahul gandhi kaa congress adhyaksh bananaa somvaar ko tay ho gaya
 Only Rahul has filed his nomination, so there is still a formal announcement to elect him unopposed
 ve adhyaksh ke naate apni maa sonia gandhi se party kii bagdor thamenge, jinhone 19 saal tak ye jimmedaari sanbhali
 In recent years, there has been similar uncontested coronation for the post of Congress President
 lekin congress ke itihaas main aise kai maukey aae jab adhyaksh kii kursi ke liye party ke bheetar hi jamkar ghamaasan hua
 The most famous anecdote in this is when, despite all the opposition of Jawahar Lalnehru, the grandfather of Rajiv Gandhi, the father of Rahul Gandhi, Purshottam Das Tandon managed to become the president of the Congress
 baat agast 1950 kii he jab congress adhyaksh kaa chunaav hona tha
 Jeevatram Bhagwan Das Kripalani, famously known as Acharya Kripalani and Purshottam Das Tandon coming from the city of Nehru, was famous in the competition nehruaur tandon bhale hi ek shahar se aate the lekin vichaardhaara ko lekar donon ke bich jabardast matbhed the
 Nehru believed that Tandon was a conservative Hindu ideology and that becoming his party president would not be in the interest of the country and the party
 isse pehle hindi ko rashtrabhasha banane ko lekar bhi tandon or nehru main vivaad ho chukaa tha
 Tandon was a strong supporter of Hindi and was putting full force behind making it the language of the entire country
 lekin udaaravaadi swabhaav vaale nehru kaa maananaa tha ki is tarah se hindi ko gaiyr hindi bhashi rajyon par thopanaa thik nahin hoga
 Not only this, Tandon's views against Pakistan were also very aggressive and he once spoke of taking revenge from Pakistan in a gathering of refugees, who had gone through a war of words
 nehru kaa maananaa tha ki aise vichaaron se logon kii bhaavana or bhadkegi
 At that time, if Purushottam Das Tandon had come against the Congress's strongest leader Netanehruki, it was because Sardar Patel (vallabh Bhai Patel) stood behind him
 sardaar patel chaahate the ki tandon har haalat main party ke adhyaksh bane
 Patel and Nehru had a huge dispute on another very important issue just a few months before this election
 wo maamla tha bharat ke pehle raashtrapati chune jane kaa
 Nehru wanted C
 Rajagopalachari, who was known as Rajaji, to be the first President
 lekin patel kii pasand the rajendra prasad
 When Nehru did not want to, Rajendra Prasad managed to become president due to Patel's influence
 isliye 1950 main congress ke adhyaksh pad kaa chunaav unke liye naak sawaal ban gaya tha
 But when the elections were held, once again Patel and Nehru were overwhelming
 tandon aasaani se acharya kriplani ko aasaani se haraakar congress adhyaksh chun liye gaye
 Much hurt on Nehruis
 unhone si rajagopalaachari ko apana dard bayaan karte hue chitti main likhaa, ‘tandon kaa chunaa janaa ye saaf dikhaata he ki ab shaayad na party ko meri jarurat he or na hi sarkaar ko
 i am feeling very tired and i feel that i will hardly be able to do anything satisfactorily now
 ”but Sardar Patel passed away on 15 December 1950, four months after Tandon was elected president
 iske baad tandon kii raah behad mushkil ho gayi
 His differences with Nehru grew
 sarkaar or party ke bich khai is kadar chaudi hoti gai ki dabaav banane ke liye nehru ne congress varking cameti se istipha de diya
 Seeing the matter catching on, Tandon finally had to bow down
 tandon ne 10 sitambar 1951 ko adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya or unki jagahajwahar laal nehrupradhanmantri ke saath saath party ke adhyaksh bhi ban gaye
 For the next four years, Nehru continued to hold both the post of party president and prime minister
