 This is democracy
 aapkaa sawaal jinase hota he aap unheen se mukhaabit hote hai

 But this is not the whole picture

 It is difficult to imagine the way in which all the speakers were speaking openly at ITM University in Gwalior

 This struggle intensified when he got up for his speech

 Why do we stop ourselves so much, why are we afraid to speak, why hesitate, what will happen if i speak

 There was only one chair gap between us

 He started to explain why he decided

 Satyapal Malik also said that Ravish bhai, you talked about the fax machine and derailed me, that is, derailed
 main ab unki baat ko ricard karne laga tha

 rajyapal ne jo jawaab diya usamen kisi ko nahin choda
 Neither the leaders of Kashmir nor the government of Delhi nor the Delhi media that defame Kashmir

 When i started coming towards my chair, i got up from my chair
 unhone apana haath badhaayaa or maine apana
 We both shook hands
 na to unki nazaron main gussa tha or na hi meri nazaron main sharmindagi
 He sat in his high chair with the governor
 raashtragan ke baad jab ve jane ke liye uthe to meri taraf aae or kuch bate bataane lage
 Even at that moment, they were asking for trust from me and i was promising not to break the trust
 unhone mujh par bharosa kiya or baaten bataayin
 i said that but you have sent the recording of what you have given to Delhi
 bas main chalaane se pehle aapako bataa dena chahta hum
 He said what is said on record is on record

 Standing behind, his ADC laughed
 shaayad unhone bhi aisa nahin sochaa hoga ki loktantr main yah bhi ho saktaa he
 After this we reached the house of Ramashankar Singh
 unke lon main ek mez par ek taraf rajyapal khaanaa kha rahe the or duusari chor par main aakar baith gaya
 The people around were suddenly seeing that here again they were face to face
 main thali main daal or roti kii jagah tay karne main vyast ho gaya taaki machhlee ke liye thik-thaak jagah ban sake
 Then Governor Satyapal Malik got up from his chair and came next to me
 kisi ne bagal main kursi rakhi or rajyapal mere kareeb baith gaye
 He talked a lot about what he is doing for the youth of Kashmir
 maine kaha ki ladakh main uniwarsity nahin he
 Students are very upset
 satyapal malik ne kaha ki mujhe pataa he or main kuch kar rahaa hum
 There have been some other things that are not meant to be mentioned here

 This was the most constructive moment of democracy

 Perhaps it must have been a wonderful moment in the life of Governor Satyapal Malik

 bas main chalaane se pehle aapako bataa dena chahta hum
 He said what is said on record is on record
 ham donon hansane lage
 Standing behind, his ADC laughed
 shaayad unhone bhi aisa nahin sochaa hoga ki loktantr main yah bhi ho saktaa he
 After this we reached the house of Ramashankar Singh
 unke lon main ek mez par ek taraf rajyapal khaanaa kha rahe the or duusari chor par main aakar baith gaya
 The people around were suddenly seeing that here again they were face to face
 main thali main daal or roti kii jagah tay karne main vyast ho gaya taaki machhlee ke liye thik-thaak jagah ban sake
 Then Governor Satyapal Malik got up from his chair and came next to me
 kisi ne bagal main kursi rakhi or rajyapal mere kareeb baith gaye
 He talked a lot about what he is doing for the youth of Kashmir
 maine kaha ki ladakh main uniwarsity nahin he
 Students are very upset
 satyapal malik ne kaha ki mujhe pataa he or main kuch kar rahaa hum
 There have been some other things that are not meant to be mentioned here
 iske baad rajyapal malik ijazat lekar uthe ki mujhe janaa padegaa kyonki andhera ho jane par meraa helicopter land nahin kar paaegaa
 This was the most constructive moment of democracy
 ai tii em uniwarsity main rajyapal ne kashmir ko lekar jo kaha use lekar vivaad ho saktaa he
 i have no firm opinion on that because i am not a Kashmiri
 lekin us dauraan jo unka vyavhaar tha vah mere jivan ke yaadgaar kshanon main se ek he
 Perhaps it must have been a wonderful moment in the life of Governor Satyapal Malik
 bharat ke loktantr ko aise or shandaar lamhon kii zarurat he
 The way the questioning question is getting over, it is important that this space is regained
 tippaniyan i wrote all this so that you can better judge how right this method of gaining the space of democracy was and how both passed this examination
 phiza main dar kaa maahaul he
 Don't ask, the job will go away
 pucho mat twitor par gaali dene vaale aa jaaenge
 We were both free from this pressure
 jab aap donon baaten janenge tabhi aap sahi tarah se jaj kar paaenge ki us din jo hua uskaa laabh kise mila he
 The atmosphere of democracy has got either one person or another
 main yah sari baaten nahin likhata to unke us vakt ke vyavhaar ke saath anadar ho jaataa or aap viral ho rahe mere video se sirf ek hi paksh ko jaan pate
 The Governor appreciated my right to ask questions and my nature of speaking
 mujhe kashmir aane kaa nyauta diya
 Thanks to Governor Satyapal Malik for all this
 ab rajyapal bhaashan dene ke liye kursi se uthte hai
 My talk had affected his mind
 unke paas bhi tay karne kaa vakt kam tha ki meri baat par jawaab den yaa jo taiyaar kar aaen hai vahi bolen
 Generally, governors give ceremonial speeches at convocation ceremonies
 satyapal malik ke bheetar unki javaani ke dinon kaa chaatr netaa jaag uthaa
 There was a slight anger in his words but he did not insult me at all
 bhashaa kii maryaada nahin todi
 They started talking about me with my name
 mud kar meri taraf dekhne lage
 He started to explain why he decided
 fax mashin kii baat puri baat nahin he
 Satyapal Malik also said that Ravish bhai, you talked about the fax machine and derailed me, that is, derailed
 main ab unki baat ko ricard karne laga tha
 i was watching from behind the camera in response to my own talk to a governor
 rajyapal ne jo jawaab diya usamen kisi ko nahin choda
 Neither the leaders of Kashmir nor the government of Delhi nor the Delhi media that defame Kashmir
 vah ajeeb vidambnaaon kaa lamhaa tha
 In Kashmir, the Governor was presenting his stand in connection with the alleged constitution and murder of democracy, but in the process, he was also expanding democracy
 ek nayaa paimaana garh rahe the
 Giving answers among the public
 ve chaahate to apane pad kii haisiyat kaa istamaal karte hue mere bare main ulta sidhaa bol sakate the, magar aisa bilkul nahin kiya tab bhi jab maine unhen di-rail kar diya tha
 Governor Satyapal Malik also suddenly came up with great numbers in this examination
 unka bhaashan khatm hua
 When i started coming towards my chair, i got up from my chair
 unhone apana haath badhaayaa or maine apana
 We both shook hands
 na to unki nazaron main gussa tha or na hi meri nazaron main sharmindagi
 He sat in his high chair with the governor
 raashtragan ke baad jab ve jane ke liye uthe to meri taraf aae or kuch bate bataane lage
 Even at that moment, they were asking for trust from me and i was promising not to break the trust
 unhone mujh par bharosa kiya or baaten bataayin
 i said that but you have sent the recording of what you have given to Delhi
 bas main chalaane se pehle aapako bataa dena chahta hum

 iske baad ham log ramashankar singh ke ghar pahunche
 The Governor was eating food on one table in his lawn and on the other end i came and sat down
 aas-paas ke log sahame dekh rahe the ki yahaan phir aamane-saamne hai
 i got busy fixing the place of lentils and rotis in the thali to make a good place for the fish
 tabhi rajyapal satyapal malik apni kursi se uthakar mere bagal main aa gaye
 Someone put a chair next to me and the governor sat close to me
 unhone bahut kuch bataaya ki kashmir ke yuvaaon ke liye kya kya kar rahe hai
 i said that there is no university in Ladakh
 chaatr bahut pareshaan hai
 Satyapal Malik said that i know and i am doing something
 kuch baaten or bhi huin jinka yahaan bataane kaa matlab nahin he
 After this, Governor Malik got up with permission that i have to go because my helicopter will not be able to land when it gets dark
 yah loktantr kaa sabase rachanaatmak kshan tha
 At the ITM University, there may be a dispute over what the Governor said about Kashmir
 us par meri koi thos raay nahin he kyonki main kashmir kaa jaankaar nahin hum
 But his behavior during that time is one of the memorable moments in my life
 shaayad yah rajyapal satyapal malik ke jivan kaa bhi shandaar lamhaa rahaa hoga
 India's democracy needs more such magnificent moments
 jis tarah se saamne sawaal karne kii parampara khatm hoti ja rahi he, uske liye zaruri he ki is spes ko phir se hasil kiya jaae
 The comments maine yah sab isliye likhaa taaki aap behatar tareeke se jaj kar saken ki loktantr ke spes ko hasil karne kaa yah tarika kitna sahi tha or donon ne is imtahaan ko kaise paas kiya
 There is an atmosphere of fear in Fiza
 pucho mat naukari chali jaaegi
 Don't ask, abusers will come on Twitter
 ham donon hi is dabaav se mukt the
 When you know both things, then only you will be able to judge properly who has got the benefit of what happened that day
 loktantr ke maahaul ko mila he yaa phir kisi ek vyakti ko
 If i did not write all these things, i would have disrespected their behavior at that time and you would have known only one side of my video which was going viral
 rajyapal ne mere sawaal poochne ke adhikaar or bolne ke swabhaav kii saraahna kii
 Invited me to come to Kashmir
 in sabake liye rajyapal satyapal malik kaa shukriya

 pichley saal datia se laapata hua anand gupta naam kaa ek yuvak haal hi main ghar waapas laut aayaa
 The happiness of his family was not there, but with the return of Anand, the wounds of Soni Khangar of Gwalia village of Shivpuri became green again
 khangaar ke 20 varshiya bete netaram ko police ne anand ke apharan kaa aaropee maanate hue hiraasat main le liya tha or hiraasat main hi uski maut ho gai thi
 His body was found hanging from the tree
 maamle kii nyaayik jaanch hui, to pataa chalaa ki netaram ne aatmahatya nahin kii thi balki uski maut police kii pratadia se hui thi
 Anand, who returned home, told the police that Netram or his family were not involved in his extinction
 yah kahani pichley 5 march, 2013 se shuru hoti he, jab udaguwaan gaanv ke rakesh gupta ne bete anand ke laapata hone kii report darj karwaai thi
 The needle of police suspicion was towards Gopal Khangar of Gwalia village in Shivpuri district
 jaanch report ke mutabik, police ke haath jab gopal nahin laga to vah uske bhai netaram ko uthaakar udaguwaan thane le ai
 Police here illegally detained Netram for nearly nine days

 Netram succumbed to his torture

 dodhi ke saath milakar is hatya ko aatmahatya kaa naam dene ke liye netaram kaa shav khet main ek ped par taang diya
 The post-mortem report also described it as a case of suicide
 (police hiraasat main maare gaye netaram ke gamgin mata-pita)netaram ke pita soni khangaar ko yakeen nahin tha ki unka betaa aatmahatya kar saktaa he
 He therefore demanded a judicial inquiry into the case, which proved that Netram died of police torture
 yah bhi pataa chalaa ki postmortem report bhi police ke dabaav main taiyaar kii gai thi
 In this case, including four police officers, Drs

 Five months have passed since the judicial inquiry was completed

 The deceased Netram was innocent
 ’’ haalanki apane adhikariyon par karrwai kii baat ve siidi jaanch kii aad main taal jate hai
 Here, Khangar, who lost his innocent son, is still in panic
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘police hamen or un sabhi gavaahon ko dhamka rahi he jinhone nyaayik jaanch main bayaan die the
 Datia Police is now under the scanner due to Anand's return and giving clean chit to Netram on his behalf
 usase is baat kaa jawaab dete nahin ban rahaa he ki bekasoor netaram ko hiraasat main kyon rakhaa gaya tha or usase vah gunaah kyon kabool karavaaya ja rahaa tha, jo usne kabhi kiya hi nahin
 The police department is still trying to rescue its accused officers
 naam na chhapane kii shart par siidi ke ek adhikari bataate hai, ‘‘nyaayik jaanch ke baad police vibhaag ne vaise to chaaron pulisavaalon or teenon doctoron ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya he
 But the police's CID investigation is being done keeping in mind that the police had questioned Netram on suspicion
 yah jaanch bhi kii ja rahi he ki kahin netaram kii tabiyat hiraasat main liye jane ke pehle se to kharaab nahin thi? aise main siidi jaanch main yah maamla hatya kii bajaae gaiyr-iradatan hatya main tabdeel ho jaae

 The film's story is woven around the campaign of 'swachh Bharat'
 svachh bharat mishan ke tahat khaas taur par gramin ilaakon main ghar-ghar main shauchalay (toilet) banavaane par jor he jisase khule main shouch ke liye naa janaa pade
 Women especially face problems due to lack of toilet in the house
 reel life se hat kar real life kii baat kii jaae to upi ke gonda se acchhee khabar saamne ai he
 The daughter-in-law presented a toilet to her daughter-in-law after she got married here
 saas-sasur ne bahu ko diya toiletbata den ki haal main hue ek survey main gonda ko bharat kaa sabase asvachh shahar ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 Here the mother-in-law has presented a toilet for others by presenting a toilet to the new daughter-in-law
 maamla upi ke gonda jile ke paraspur vikaas khand ke dullapur tarhar gaanv kaa he
 When all the relatives were giving all the gifts to the new daughter-in-law, Sushmita Yadav, at the same time, the mother-in-law announced to give toilet to the daughter-in-law
 sushmita ke sasur bansi laal yadav kaa kahana he ki mahilaayein jab khule main shouch jaati he to unhen takaleef hoti he
 For this reason, first built a toilet and then married the son
 bansi laal yadav ke mutabik unki apni beti jab sasuraal gai thi to vahaan bhi unhone toilet kii maang kii thi
 Sushmitasushmita is a student of final year of graduation
 She is a student of final year of graduation in a reputed college in the city

 Sushmita was married to Balveer Yadav on 21 May in Dullapur
 shaadi se pehle sushmita ke man main kahin naa kahin ye dar tha ki sasuraal main ghar main toilet naa hua to kya hoga
 But Sushmita breathed a sigh of relief when the mother-in-law asked to give toilet in her mouth
 ab sushmita saas-sasur kaa shukriya adaa karte nahin thak raheen
 Family will be honored When the matter of giving toilet gifts to the new daughter-in-law reached the district administration, they decided to honor this family
 gonda kii mukhya vikaas adhikari (sidio) divya mittal ne is maukey par parivaar ko 12,000 rupye kaa check bhi bhent kiya
 This is the government incentive amount that is given to build a toilet in the house
 is maukey par divya mittal ne kaha ki ye hamaari taraf se nai bahu ko munh dikhaai he
 Because the father-in-law of the new daughter-in-law has already given toilet gifts, so now she can buy anything she likes with this amount
 sidio ne ye bhi kaha ki unhen khud bhi shaadi ke baad munhadikhai main tamaam tarah kii chijen mili thim
 But when a mother-in-law takes such a step for her daughter-in-law, then her precious feelings can be understood

 narendra modi sarkaar ne apane aitihaasik faisle ke tahat anuchhed 370 ko asarhin kar diya
 Home Minister Amit Shah told the Rajya Sabha on Monday or August 5 that the government has abolished all other provisions in three clauses of Article 370, except just 370 (1)
 jisase ab jammu-kashmir ko mili visheshadhikaar khatm ho jaaenge
 Instead of abolishing Article 370 altogether, the government used scissors only on those provisions through which Jammu and Kashmir had more rights than other states of the country
 anuchhed 370 ke kaaran sansad se paarit raksha, videsh or sanchaar maamalon ko chhodkar anya kanoon sidhe vahaan lagu nahin ho sakate the
 It is being told that the last remaining provision i
e
 370 (1) can also be ended

 On which the Supreme Court has issued a notice to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Law in the past and has also sought an answer
 yachikakarta ashvini upaadhyaay kehete hai ki agar sarkaar dhara 370 ko asarhin nahin karti to bhi maamla supreme court main sunwaayee ke dauraan nahin tikta
 But the Government, taking a welcoming and bold initiative, neutralized Section 370
 phir bhi 370 (1) ab bhi kaayam he
 Due to which the President can still implement laws in Jammu and Kashmir only with the consent of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir
 upaadhyaay kaa kahana he ki unke paas 370 (1) ko bhi nirast karaane ke liye aisi daleelein hai, jis par supreme court sunwaayee ke dauraan sahamat ho saktaa he
 According to Upadhyay, if the government files its reply on the notice of the Supreme Court on time, then the remaining provision can also be removed from the Supreme Court
 jisase jammu-kashmir main sansad se paarit kisi kanoon ke lagu karne ke liye vahaan kii vidhansabha se poochne kii jarurat nahin padegi

 Politics continues in Delhi on CCTV tender
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or uparajyapal anil baijal dwaara ek duusare ko bheje ja rahe khat se maamla or garma gaya he
 Earlier, the Congress has accused the AAP government of scam, questioning the tender process of CCTV
 dilli main sisitivi camere na lagane se naaraaz mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne somvaar ko aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon or mantriyon ke saath alji house tak paidal march kiya
 During a public meeting, the Delhi CM said, 'kejriwal fights a lot, hey you pass the CCTV camera file so why will i fight
 alji sar, main apane saare vidhayakon or mantriyon ko lekar aapse milane aa rahaa hum or agar aapane sisitivi kii fil roki to phir sari dilli aegi
 Please tell that before this, the Lieutenant Governor wrote a letter to Kejriwal
 uparajyapal anil baijal ke khat kii mukhya baaten -• uparajyapal ne mukhyamantri ko bataaya ki alji karyaalay mencisitivi camerailgane kii yojana se sambandhit koi prastaav praapt nahin hua he
 • The proposal related to the work of installation of CCTV cameras is pending only with the elected government
 sisitivi ke kaam ke prastaav ko rokane ke liye is karyaalay dwaara koi nirdesh jari nahin kiya gaya he
 • Using CCTV cameras effectively for law enforcement, crime and investigation prevention requires an SOP / regulatory framework for CCTV
 yahi kaaran he ki samiti kii sthapana hui
 Highlights of the reply letter of Arvind Kejriwal to LG - • i am writing in response to your letter on an important issue related to the safety of the residents of Delhi
 mujhe bahut dukh hua ki aapane mahilaon kii suraksha or suraksha ke rup main is tarah ke ek mahatvapurn mudde ko raajnneetik banane kii koshish kii he
 i sincerely feel that all parties should work together on this issue
 • aapane kaha he ki aapane sisitivi camere pariyojna ko nahin roka he
 a simple question arises, so why did you set up this committee? Clearly, this has been done to create barriers for the elected government
 • aapane kaha he ki pichley do varshon main anya agenciyon dwaara do lakh se adhik camere sthapit kiye gaye the
 Why didn't you set up a committee then? NDMC is the highest security area of delhi
 pichley do varshon main unhone kai hajaar camere sthapit kiye hai
 Why didn't you set up the committee then? Now when the Delhi government wants to install CCTV cameras, you have arbitrarily set up this committee, except the elected government
 • aapane kaha he ki yah samiti camere kii sthapana ke liye niamak dhaanche, niyamon or prakriyaaon kaa masauda taiyaar karegi
 Which law empowers LG to frame such a committee to frame laws and regulations to frame regulatory frameworks and install CCTV cameras? Sir, there is a constitution and the law and LG are bound by those laws and the constitution
 aap samvidhan kaa ulanghan kyon kar rahe hai?• yadi samitiyaan kanoon, niyam, nitiyaan or dhaancha banaati hai, to cabinet, sansad or assembly kya karenge?mukhyamantri ne aage apane khat main endiemasi kshetron main chal rahe model kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 1) The location of the camera is decided by the local RWA, the local police and the camera installation company
 2) diviar ardblue dwaara pradaan kiye gaye kamare main rakhaa gaya he
 3) Feed is available for NDMC, RWA and Police
 arvind kejariwal ne alji se poocha he ki is tarah ke model ko khaarij kyon kiya gaya
 Kejriwal further told LG that he rejects the CCTV committee, as it is designed to create hurdles and without any legal basis

 kejariwal ne khud ramlila maidan main yah sweekaara tha ki bhagwaan ne unhen banaras ke liye dilli chhodane kii sajaa di thi, to kya unhone usase koi sikh nahin lee
 Because Kejriwal himself said, 'god has punished what happened in the Lok Sabha elections
 ahankaar kii
 i have been ordered by God, ordered by the people of Delhi and now i will not go anywhere for five years
 'beete varsh sitambar menkejarivalane ludhiana main kaha, ' yaheen punjab main khunta gaadkar baithunga or jab tak badalon ko jail nahin bhej detaa, tab tak main punjab chhod kar nahin jaaoongaa
 'kejriwal has been accused of reversing his words
 kabhi congress se gathbandhan naa karne kii baat kehane vaale kejariwal congress ke samarthan se dilli main sarkaar banane ko taiyaar ho jate hai
 Never make any compulsion to fulfill all his election promises
 haal hi main kejariwal ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan kaha ki ve punjab or goa kaa chunaav vahaan kii janata ke liye lard rahe hai
 The people of Punjab and Goa now want an honest government

 Marriage is like a beautiful dream for every girl
 shaadi kii puri prakriya itani thakaan bhari hoti he ki ladki ko bahut adhik sochane kaa samay hi nahin mil paata
 But when she leaves after getting married, many kinds of thoughts start to swirl in her mind
 shaadi ke baad pehali raat har nae jode ke liye khaas hoti he
 But the next morning of marriage is like entering a new life for the girl
 aise main uske man main tarah-tarah ke sawaal or sanshay aate-jate hai
 However, she does not share these things with anyone
 1
 The next morning of the wedding is very special
 ladki ke dimag main ye baat bahut gahare tak baithi hoti he ki use subah jaldi uthanaa he
 As she wakes up, the girl starts worrying about how she has to do all the work now
 har ladki chaahati he ki shaadi kii pehali subah se hi sasuraal main vah sabaki chaheti ban jaae
 2
 shaadi se pehle nae ghar or saathi ko lekar har ladki kii apni ek soch hoti he
 The next morning of marriage, every girl feels that her decision to choose this person as her life partner was not right
 kahin aisa to nahin ki yah parivaar uski soch ke bilkul pare he
 3
 yah bahut saamaanya si baat he
 Till our work is not done, we feel how long it is taking place
 lekin jab vahi kaam ho jaataa he to hamen lagane lagata he ki sab kuch kitni jaldi-jaldi ho rahaa he
 Girls feel the same after marriage
 4
 This is perhaps a question that is difficult to solve
 har ladki chaahati he ki vah khubasurat dikhe
 In such a situation, most girls remain confused about the choice of clothes
 5
 This concern means a lot to girls of today's generation
 aaj jabaki film dekhne se lekar khaane ke menu tak ko fasebuk par share kiya ja rahaa he aise main ladakiyon ko states change karnaa kisi jaruri kaam kii tarah lagata he
 Putting the status of 'got Engaged' and 'god Married' also becomes an important task
 6
 Every girl takes some time to believe in this
 shaadi ke baad jindagi puri tarah badal jaati he
 In such a situation, every girl finds it difficult to believe that she is now married and has become the axis of a new family

 gujarat kii do rajyasabha siton par hone vaale chunaav main bhartiya janata party or congress ke bich kadi takkar hone vaali he
 After BJP, now Congress has also decided to field candidates in Rajya Sabha elections
 aaj congress ke do pratyaashee gaurav pandya or chandrika chudasma namakan daakhil karenge
 Let me tell you, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Minister Smriti Irani resigned from Rajya Sabha membership
 iske baad upachunaav ho rahe hai
 The Election Commission has ordered separate voting for different seats
 agar voting alag-alag hoti he to donon seat bijepi jeetegi
 The Congress has reached the Supreme Court against this decision of the Election Commission
 aaj yani mangalvaar ko is maamle main sunwaayee ho sakati he
 If voting takes place on the same ballot paper, BJP can win one seat and Congress on one seat
 bataa den ki gujarat kii do rajyasabha siton par 5 july ko hone vaale chunaav ko lekar vivaad chal rahaa he
 Congress leader in the state Opposition Pareshbhai Dhanani objected to the simultaneous elections to both the seats and reached the Supreme Court against the decision of the Election Commission

 chunaav ayog kii adhisuchana ke mutabik, amit shah ko loksabhaa chunaav jeetne kaa praaanpatr 23 may to vahiin smriti ko 24 may ko mila tha
 This led to a difference of one day in the election of both, on the basis of which the Commission has considered the two seats of the state separately, but the voting has to be on the same day
 congress kaa tark he ki aisa hone se ab donon siton par bijepi ko jeet mil jaaegi kyonki, vahaan pratham variyata vot nae sire se tay honge
 But if elections were held simultaneously, the Congress would get a seat
 gauratlab he ki sankhya bal ke hisaab se gujarat main rajyasabha kaa chunaav jeetne ke liye ummidavaar ko 61 vot chahie
 An election on the same ballot will allow a candidate to cast a single vote

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The state-run Xinhua quoted the Shanghai Airport Authority as saying that the explosion occurred at around 2:20 pm near the check-in counter at Terminal 2 of Shanghai Pudang International Airport
 baad main laga ki yah desi bam ho saktaa he
 The comments ghayalon ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he

 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Congress has not yet accepted all the conditions of Gujarat's Patidar leader Hardik Patel, Hardik has given the last till November 3 and now till November 7
 is bich, hardik ne ab duusare raajnneetik dalon ke daravaaje par dastak dena shuru kar diya he
 NCP leader Praful Patel met Hardik Patel on Wednesday
 prafull patel vahi netaa hai, jinhone pichley dinon gujarat ke rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan enesipi vidhayak ko kol karke bijepi ke paksh main vot dilvaaya tha
 In such a situation, political matters are being searched for meeting Hardik and Prafulla
 sawaal uth rahaa he ki is bahaane hardik kii congress par dabaav banane kii koshish to nahin he?bijepi ke daravaaje bandadrasal hardik patel ne 2015 main patidaar samudaay ke lieaarakshan andolanshuru kiya tha
 Hardik Patel, who made his mark through the reservation movement, is a trump card in the politics of Gujarat
 iske chalate sabhi raajnneetik dal hardik ke jariye patidaar samudaay ke voton ko apane paksh main karne kii jugat main he
 Due to the reservation movement, Hardik and the ruling BJP came face to face, which is why all doors are closed for Hardik within the BJP
 aise main hardik tisare ghar kii talash main he
 Unable to deal with the Congress, till a few days ago, it seemed that Hardik would join the Congress, but at the last moment he gave an ultimatum to the Congress
 unhone patidaar samaaj ko kota dene ke maamle main congress ko pehle 3 november tak kii mohalat di
 They later said that they would wait until 7 November
 congress ne ab is par chuppi saadh lee he
 This is believed to have killed the ax on his own
 congress ke haath khinch lene ke baad hardik ke paas chunaav main zyada vikalp bache nahin he
 The NCP and Hardik Congress were in talks that NCP leader Praful Patel met Hardik Patel on Wednesday
 jiske baad se hardik ke ensipi main jane kii atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai
 Hardik Patel may be asking not to see this meeting through electoral spectacles, but due to the time in which this meeting is taking place, it is special in many ways
 raajnneetik jaankaar kii maane tohardik ne prafull patelse mulaakaat karke congress par dabaav banane kii koshish to nahin ho rahi he
 Praful Patel is not going to be a breaker in the way of Congress? Praful Patel is the same leader of NCP, who recently called the NACP MLA during the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat and got votes in favor of BJP
 prafull patel or hardik ke mulaakaat ke peeche raajnneetik jaankaar kehete hai ki congress main jane se rokane ke liye ye sab kiya gaya he
 Because if Hardik had joined hands, Gujarat would certainly have gained a lot in Gujarat
 aise main bijepi ne kahin prafull ko hardik or congress kii raah main braker ke taur par to kahin istemaal nahin kiya he

 samachar agency sinhua ne adhikari ke hawaale se kaha, 'subah paanch baje endies offis par chah logon ne hamalaa bol diya, jiske baad muthbhed hui
 "in order to get the terrorists into the premises," the officer said, a terrorist blasted a vehicle filled with explosives into the office wall

 The comments aspataal ke adhikariyon ne kaha, 'bachche kaa hamaare aspataal main ilaaj kiya gaya
 We cannot give more information than this
 shahar main congress ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki priyanka or unke bete ke yahaan aane or jane kaa kaarykram kaa koi prachaar prasar nahin kiya gaya tha
 This was his personal visit
 congress netaa ne kaha ki wo yahaan subah pahunche or dopaher main waapas chale gaye
 Hospital officials said, 'the child was treated in our hospital
 isse zyada ham kuch jaankaree nahin de sakate'
 a senior Congress leader in the city said that there was no publicity of Priyanka and her son coming and going
 ye unka nijee daura tha
 The Congress leader said that he arrived here in the morning and went back in the afternoon
 congress netaa ne kaha ki wo yahaan subah pahunche or dopaher main waapas chale gaye
 Budget will be presented next week
 fouran hi uske vishleshan bhi hone lagenge,lekin desh kii mali haalat ke maddenzar is saal sarkaar ke saamne badi-badi chunautiyaan hai,isiilie asaar hai ki bajet jatil hoga
 Analysts may have to dig a lot to understand this
 baharhaal,pesh hone se pehle bajet ke kuch nukton kii charchaa
 The budget did not create people's expectations
 
 
 chalan rahaa he ki bajet se apane liye ummid lagane vaala har tabaka apni maang bataata tha,lekin is baar maang karti ye awaazen kam sunai deen
 That is, whatever the government will decide with its own will, it has to be accepted that it is necessary for the people
 isiilie bajet vishleshkon ko pehle se taiyaari karke rakhni padegi ki desh ke maujuuda suuratehaal main bajet main kya karnaa zyaada zaruri tha or sarkaar ne kis kaam ko zaruri mana
 Understanding budget is getting complicated
 
 
 koi sarkaar kahati kuch bhi rahe,lekin vah karti kya he,iskaa pataa bajet se hi chalata he
 Now it is a different matter that budgets have started getting complicated here for some years
 bajet dastauez main ankon main likhi rakamon kii kalmen zyaada dikhni chahie,lekin kuch saalon se bajet main shabd or falsafa zyaada pesh hone lage hai
 This time analysts should be prepared to analyze more complex documents
 mali haalat kaa dabaav sabase zyaada
 
 
 We say whatever you want, but this time your financial condition has put you in great concern
 aarthik vruddhi dar ke lakshya hasil karne main dikkat ai
 Banks are caught in the NPA problem
 sarkaar par karz kaa boj badhata ja rahaa he
 Employment and occupation are becoming less
 kisaan garib hote ja rahe hai
 The government is having difficulty in increasing the revenue in sufficient quantity to spend on essential works
 darasal,tex vasuulne se khate-pite tabake vaali va sampann janata or udyog-vyapaar vaale tabake ke naaraaz hone kaa khutka bana rahata he
 However, the purpose of democratic budget is that the government keeps trying to bring everyone on an equal footing
 amiron se paisa leti rahe or garibon ko detii rahe
 What is the biggest obstacle
 
 
 ?darasal,lokapriyata banaae rakhane ke liye sarkarein khate-pite tabake se tex vasuuli kar rajasav badhaane se bachati hai
 However, four years ago, in one stroke, the government had made arrangements to increase its treasury by imposing heavy tax on oil, diesel-petrol
 vah intazaam bhi isliye ho paaya tha,kyonki ittfa se vishwa bazaar main kachche tel ke daam girakar ek chauthai rah gaye the,so,sarkaar ne iskaa phayda upabhoktaaon ko dene kii bajaay tel par tex badhaakar apana rajasav badha liya tha
 The public was not relieved from oil inflation
 aaj tak yah tex itnaa baari-bharkam bana hua he,isiilie is apratyaksh kar se or zyaada paisa ikattha karne kii gunjaaish bhi nahin he
 It is very difficult to raise and treasure
 
 
 abhi kuch maheene pehle hi,yani aam chunaav se pehle madhyavarg ko inakam tex main raahat ke liye kar seemaa dhai lakh se badhaakar paanch lakh kar di gai thi
 Immediately after winning the election, it is a risky task for the government to raise the income tax so soon
 isi tarah chunavi daur main kai chizon paranghshthghtane ke iraade kai baar jataae ja chuke hai,so, gstse rajasav badhaane main dikkat he
 Not only this, the revenue target from GST last year does not appear to be achieved
 so,nae bajet menkeghshthse zyaada rajasav kaa bada lakshya bhi nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Still, money will have to be brought to the government treasury from somewhere
 media kii naveenatam khabaron ke mutabik sarkari kaarkaanon or udhyam parisaron ko bechakar kuch paisa khazaane main laayaa ja saktaa he,lekinundha-1ke dauraan aisi koshishen ke nattejey achche nahin aae the,sarkaar kii badanaami hi hui thi
 There is also no scope for reducing government expenditure
 
 
 sarkari kharch ghataane ke chakkar main pichley saal shiksha or swasthya jaise kuch zaruri madon kii andekhi kar di gai thi
 That was the year before the election, so the tip was not analyzed in the most media
 pichley saal ke purna bajet ke vishleshan main media ne ascharyajanak sanyam bartaa tha,lekin is baar sthiti alag he
 General elections are settled
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki is baar sarkaar ko lekar media kaa kya rukh rahata he
 It is not easy to forget the promises
 
 
 sarkaar ke chunavi vaadon kii fehrist bahut lambii he,ise ginanaa lanbaa kaam he,lekin motaa anumaan he ki agle paanch saal main in vaadon ko puraa karne kaa nunatam kharch80lakh karod rupee baithegaa
 That is, the government needs at least 15 lakh crores every year separately
 khazaane main pandrah lakh karod badhaane kii koi gunjaaish nahin dikhti
 The size of this year's budget does not seem to increase more than five lakh crores
 bajet kaa aakaar adhiktam tees lakh karod ke lapete main rahane kaa anumaan lagata he
 It is worth noting that the size of the last budget was only 23 lakh 99 thousand crores, i
e
 24 lakh crores
 usase pichley saal bajet kaa aakaar21lakh46hazaar karod tha
 That is, the budget size was increased to only 2
5 lakh crore
 baharhaal,is baar badhane vaale anumaanit paanch lakh karod ke rajasav se hi saare kaam nipataate hue dikhaanaa he
 Out of this small amount, the army has to buy foreign fighter planes and buy other military equipment, out of which more money has to be given to education and health
 isi main nae kisaanon ke liye har saal paanch lakh karod kharch karne kaa nayaa vaada puraa karnaa he,desh main50karod logon ko har saal paanch lakh rupee tak kaa ilaaj kharch karnaa he
 Agricultural produce godowns and farmers' mandis have to be built across the country, every house in the country has to be tapped
 inke alaava,aisi badi yojanaayen chalavaani hai,jinase rojgaar paidaa hon
 The government has made a lot of promises to the public, they are different
 ye saare vaade aise hai,jinhen janata kii yaaddaasht se mitaanaa bhi aasaan nahin
 Even unfinished work will not be abandoned
 
 
 sarkaar kaa pichhlaa daur,yaniundha-1kaa kaarykaal bhale hi khatm ho gaya ho,lekin us daur ke bahut-se kaam hona baaki hai
 For example, by 2022, all pucca houses, new facilities to double the income of farmers, free gas cylinders and toilets have not been completed yet
 100smart city,har khet tak pani kii pariyojnaayen,har saal do karod rojgaar,desh main bhavy haive,tej raftaar vaali dasiyon rail pariyojnaayen,nadi main jal parivahan kaa kaam,nadiyon ko jodne vaala baari-bharkam kharch vaala kaam,vishwastar ke vishvavidhyalayon kaa kaam paison ke kaaran hi susti main he
 The work of many medical institutions like AIIMS has been slow due to lack of money
 ye sab ve kaam hai,jinhen kisi bhi surat main roka yaa choda nahin ja saktaa
 Every year before the election, a plan of giving Rs 500 to the farmer family has to be arranged for 90,000 crores every year
 kul milakar is baar bajet main hisaab bithaane ke liye sarkaar ko zyaada hi hunar dikhaanaa padegaa
 Way to increase spending by taking losses 
 
 bahut zyaada ghate kaa bajet bhi pesh nahin ho saktaa
 The government has deprived itself of doing this
 aaj kii sarkaar jab vipaksh main hua karti thi,to pichhali sarkaron ko isi mudde par gherti thi
 However, the incumbent government can not count the benefits of the deficit budget by matching its old arguments
 ek mad main ghataakar duusari main badhaane kaa rasta
 
 
 By the way, the items that were in the previous budgets, and the amount spent in them, is almost impossible to reduce
 desh kii har vyavastha nunatam kharche se kaam chalaa rahi he
 The only way left seems to be to cleverly reduce the money of one item and increase it in the other
 yah karne ke liye bajet dastauez main bhashaa kii chaturaai kii zarurat padegi
 Priorities will have to be made
 
 
 aakhir apana desh koi do sau lakh karod kii arthvyavastha kaa desh he,so,dikhaane ke liye ek-do nae kaamon kaa elaan ho saktaa he
 It will be difficult to speculate about what will happen, and how much will be spent, but as an invisible suggestion, it can be discussed that what is the focus of this budget on the basis of the current situation in the country
 kheti-kisaani,swasthya,shiksha,kanoon evam vyavastha or or seemaa par suraksha har desh ke liye hameshaa ahm hote hi hai,lekin maujuuda rujhaan par gaur karen,to is samay sarkaar kii praathamikta main raashtra suraksha sabase upar dikhti he
 This issue is such that no one can say of any less importance, that is why there are more chances of maintaining the defense expenditure in the national interest, and if the scope comes out
 pichley do-teen saal main fouj ke liye sajo-saamaan kharidne kii zarurat safaltaapurvak sabit kii ja chuki he
 Slogans like national identity, national pride, national security, national interest are still echoing in the hearts and minds of the public, so one can speculate
 sarkaar tark de sakati he ki rashtrahit main janata ko duusari zaruuraton ko bhoolanaa padegaa
 Still some needs, which cannot be left out
 
 
 is samay raashtra par jo badi vipadaaen aa gai hai,unka samaadhaan har myne main rashtrahit hi he
 For example, the country's water management is on the verge of collapse
 jal sankat rashtriya sankat banakar desh ke saamne hai
 In the same way, the dreaded unemployment and the plight of the farmers is no less than the national calamity
 ye teenon mudde raashtra kii apaat maang hai
 Assessment of water intensity
 
 
 desh par jal sankat mandaraaya hua he
 More than two to three years, a terrible situation is becoming
 desh main kheti kii aadhi se zyaada zamin acinchit he
 a slight high seasonality causes drought or flooding in the country
 desh main jal prabandhan par sarkari dhyaan hatane se kisaan pani ke nijee intazaam par baari kharch karte mare ja rahe hai
 The reason for this has also been known
 barish ke pani ko rokkar rakhane ke liye nae jalaashyon or baandh banane kaa kaam band-sa he,jabaki jal bhandaaran kii kshamta doguni karne laayak barish kaa pani desh main uplabdh he
 Money is needed to make this management a priority
 jaankaron ke mutabik is kaam ke liye shuru ke paanch saal main hi kam se kam15lakh karod kaa kharch baithta he
 That is, three lakh crore rupees every year
 berojgaare se or munh churaana ab khatarnaak
 
 
 By the year 2020, the problem of unemployment seems to be uncontrollable
 yuvaaon kii badhati aabaadi ko ham janasankhyikeey labhaansh kitna bhi kehete rahen,lekin berojgaare ke lakshan aarthik abhishaap jaise dikhaai de rahe he,isiilie bajet main chah se aath karod berojgaaron ko hille se lagane kii koi badi yojana fouran shuru hoti na dikhi,to ise bahut badi kami mana jayega
 The youth of the country do not seem to be in the mood to hear such things that by 2025 unemployment will be eliminated or by 2030 there will be no unemployment in the country
 khulanaa chahie rail bajet kaa rahasy
 
 
 Three years ago, the railway budget used to be presented separately
 nai sarkaar ai or usne san2016main yah chalan band kar diya tha
 The railway budget was merged with the general budget itself
 nateeja yah hua ki rail bajet par zyaada charchaa kii gunjaaish kam ho gai,jabaki yah aaj bhi sabase bada sarkari udhyam he
 Railways have a daily life of 136 crore population of the country
 aaj bhi vah vishwa kii sabase badi sarkari yatayaat pranali maani jaati he
 In the concept of a welfare state, the Indian railway system is not only public welfare, but the government also earns a lot of income from it
 railway ke paas khub zamin he or akut sansaadhan bhi,or rojgaar paidaa karne kii baari kshamta bhi
 It is possible that in the current Mali condition of the country, something new will be heard about the railways
 philhal hakeekat kaa to pataa nahin,lekin railway ke maamle main bich-bich main yah sugabugahat sunne ko zarur milti he ki is sarkari udhyam main nijee bhagidaari badhaane kaa iraadaa ban saktaa he
 However, in this budget, it will be seen that new announcements are made to improve the safety of trains, train latex and catering system, and how much expenditure is incurred on these works
 kul milakar aisa lag rahaa he ki is baar ke bajet ko samajhane ke liye patrakaron ko tution leni pad sakati he

 Rane is considered to have good penetration in both the parties
 swayan rane bhi yah kah chuke hai ki shivasena main uddhav or congress main ashok chavaan ko chhodkar sabhi mere dost hai
 Rane, who was also the chief minister of Shiv Sena government in 1999, never got over Uddhav

 The Mumbai attacks were the result of 'one of the most serious lapses in the history of intelligence' in which the US, UK and Indian intelligence agencies were able to put together the information gathered by their hi-tech surveillance system to avert the attack on India's financial capital
 Failed neuyork times, propublica or pibies siries 'frontline' kii 'in 2008 mumbai kilings, piles of spai data, bat en ankamplited pajal' shishark vaali ek vistrut report main kaha gaya he, 'mumbai hamalon kaa chipa itihaas samvedansheeltaa, computer nigaraanee kii shakti or intercepts ke aatankwaad rodhi hathiyaar ke rup main hone kaa khulaasa karata he

 The intelligence agencies of the three countries failed to put together all the information gathered by their high-tech surveillance and other devices that could have prevented the terrorist attack, which was so frightening that it is often called 9 / 11 of India
 ' The report said that in one of the examples of the biggest intelligence failure, Indian and British intelligence agencies had monitored the online activities of 26 / 11 planner and technology head of Pakistan-based lashkar-e-taiba terrorist group, But she could not connect the episodes before the attacks
 ' mumbai hamalon main chah americanyon sahit 166 log maare gaye the

 It cited former security adviser Shivshankar Menon in reference to intelligence gathered by agencies in the US, India and the UK months before the attacks, stating that "no one has cleared the entire picture
" ' Menon, the then foreign secretary at the time of the attacks, said, "neither the Americans nor the British nor the Indians
 
 Everyone started sharing information when the firing started
 ' However, this report said that despite an alert from the US, India could not detect the conspiracy

 Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has made a big statement linking the Pathankot and Pulwama terror attacks with the general election
 raaj thakare ne kaha he ki chunaav main jeet ke liye ek-do maheene main pulavama kii tarah ek or hamalaa ho saktaa he
 At the same time, he called Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement as an insult to the soldiers, in which the PM said that if there was an Rafale aircraft in the air strike, the result would have been different
 raaj thakare ne aarope lagaaya ki pulavama hamale se pehle khufia agenciyon ke alert ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya
 He questioned that 40 soldiers were killed in the Pulwama attack
 kya hamen sawaal bhi nahin poochna chahie? disambar main, rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal thailand kii rajdhani bainkak main pakistan ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar se mili the
 What happened between the two that now we are facing such a situation? The whole country should ask him this question
 In an attack on BJP President Amit Shah to tell the number of terrorists killed in the air strike, Thackeray asked whether Shah was a co-pilot during the air strike? Let me tell you that at a recent rally in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Amit Shah claimed that more than 250 terrorists were killed in an air strike of the Indian Air Force
 thakare ne daawa kiya ki bhartiya vaayu sena balakot main nishaanaa chook gai kyonki modi sarkaar ne unhen galat soochna di thi
 Describing the terrorists killed in the air strike as disputed, Thackeray said that if that was the case, Indian wing commander Abhinandan Vardhaman would never have been allowed to return to Pakistan
 emenes pramukh ne kaha he ki jhooth bolne kii bhi koi seemaa hoti he
 It is being lied to win the election
 chunaav jeetne ke liye agle ek do mahino main pulavama ke samaan ek or hamalaa hoga
 Referring to the deadlock over Doklam in 2017 between India and China, Thackeray said that the Prime Minister had asked citizens to abstain from Chinese products, although he failed to state that in the statue of Sardar Ballabhbhai Patel in Gujarat Where did the used goods come from? Linking the 2015 attacks in Pathankot to the election, Thackeray said that Prime Minister Modi had met the then Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif in December and had given him a cake on his birthday

All the 5 accused involved in the procession in the city of the accused of robbing 15 lakh rupees in the city, now in the grip of the police, you may have seen many road shows or religious processions of the leaders but never seen the road show of any accused, but Amroha of Uttar Pradesh The police of the Yogi Adityanath government in the district took out a procession by hanging a plank in the neck of a prize crook instead of encountering the accused of robbing Rs 15 lakh

 The police dramatized the surrender of the accused in such a way that people were shocked and this act of Gajraula police ruined the law
 aaropee 15 hajaar kaa inami badmaash bataaya ja rahaa he or iske gale main takhti padi he or takhti par likhaa he 'mujhe goli mat maarna main lut kaa aaropee hum' or bina vardi ke mahila or purush sipaahi aaropee ke saath chal rahe the or logon kii bheed bhi puure tamaashe ko dekh rahi thi
 Before the surrender, the remaining four accused involved in the robbery incident have been sent to jail

 olive oil or namak kaa paste taiyaar karke ise coton kii madad se haathon par lagaaein or thodi der ke liye chhod den
 Now clean it with the help of a dry cotton ball
 aapaki mehandi bhi halki ho jaaegi or haath bhi ruukhe nahin honge

 The Modi government is now preparing to bring a national policy for domestic workers such as meds, drivers, moving its efforts in the social sector
 isse kareeb 50 lakh logon ko phayda hoga
 Labor Minister Santosh Gangwar has given this information
 is niti ko laane kaa uddeshy gharelu kamgaaron kii madad karnaa or unhen sarkari nitiyon kaa phayda pahunchaana he
 This policy will have access to inside your home
 isse gharelu naukaron, driveron aadi ke din bahur jaaenge or unhen ve sari suvidhaayen milengi jo sangathit kshetra ke karmchaariyon ko milti hai
 If this policy is implemented then they can get facilities like ESI, provident fund, paid leave, maternity leave, etc
 ek report ke anusaar, 'neshnal policy for domestic workars' ko sabase pehle 2015 main prastaavit kiya gaya tha
 With this, people will not only have to pay more salary to their domestic servants, drivers, but it will also increase paperwork
 isliye pichley chaar saal se virodh kii vajah se yah niti lagu nahin ho pai he
 Santosh Gangwar told in the Lok Sabha that a national draft is prepared about domestic workers, which is being considered by the Central Government
 is policy ke tahat gharelu kamgaaron ko bhi maujuuda sabhi niyam-kaayadon main shaamil kiya jayega or unka registration kar unhen vaid kamgaaron ke rup main adhikaar die jaaenge
 In addition, domestic workers will also have the right to form their own organizations and unions
 iske dwaara naukaron-driveron ko nunatam vetan kaa adhikaar, saamaajik suraksha yojanaon tak pahunch tathaa durvyavhaar, pratadna or hinsa se suraksha hasil ho sakegi
 In addition, the draft policy proposes that placement agencies providing domestic help will also be controlled and regulated
 unke profeshnal skill ko sudhaarney tathaa unhen adaalaton or tribunel kii sevaaon kaa laabh milane ko bhi sambhav banaaya jayega
 The government has been trying to bring this for the last four years, but due to the opposition of many sections, this is not happening
 is niti main mard-aurat sabhi shaamil honge
 At present, there is no rule for domestic servants in the country
 log apni marji se ek-duusare se jaankaree va poochtacha ke aadhaar par apane yahaan gharelu naukar rakh lete hai
 Their salary, holidays etc
 are also decided on the basis of mutual agreement
 nai vyavastha bahut kuch videsh kii tarj par hogi, jahaan gharelu naukar rakhane waalon ko kaaphi kade niyam-kaayadon kaa paalan karnaa padataa he
 On Monday, the newly elected CM of Jammu and Kashmir Mufti Mohammed Saeed asked the Central Government for the remains of Afzal Guru
 siyasat ke suramaaon ne is ore bayaanbaji shuru kar di or desh ke bhagava bigrade ne ek baar phir afjal ko doshi or aatanki bataakar said kii khilaafat kii
 But in the midst of all this, the Congress has hit the spot
 mangalvaar ko sansad bhawan pahunche manishankar ayyar ne kaha ki afjal ke saath ninsaphi hui thi
 Making a statement outside the Parliament House, the senior Congress leader said that there was not enough evidence against Afzal Guru and he believes that there was injustice against Afzal
 khaas baat yah he ki jis samay ayyar sadan ke baahar yah bayaan de rahe the, usee samay loksabhaa main sarkaar beemaa vidheyak bill pesh kar rahi thi
 The bill is already in dispute, so the opposition is trying to surround the government both inside and outside the House
 raashtra virdohi tha afjal: rautis bich shivasena netaa sanjay raut ne maamle main apni pratikriya di he
 He said that Afzal was hanged because he was anti-national
 raut ne kaha, 'afjal ko supreme court or kanoon ne sajaa di
 If Mani Shankar Aiyar feels that there was injustice to Afzal then he should make this statement in Pakistan and not here
 'gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri said kii sarkaar ne centre sarkaar se sansad hamale ke gunahagaar afjal guru ke avshesh saunpane kii maang kii he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh has not given any direct response to this demand of PDP government, although the voices of opposition from BJP mlas have started to rise
 pidipi ke aath vidhayakon ne is sambandh main bayaan jari kar kaha ki party afjal ke avasheshon kii vaapasi ke liye puri takat se lage rahane kaa vaada karti he

 supreme court ke mukhya nyaayadhish justise deepak mishra aajkal dohare hamale jhel rahe hai
 From within the judiciary as well as from the opposition political parties

 Justice Chelameswarki has a lot of discussion in the corridors of the judiciary
 kaha to yahaan tak ja rahaa he ki kaayade se nyaaypalika kii swaittata ko lekar karypalika kii dakhlandaji par virodh chif justise deepak mishra ko darj karana chahie tha
 In fact, before and after the Justice Chelameswar press conference, many times he has written a letter to the Chief Justice and raised legal and constitutional questions on his working style
 abaki baar unhone karnataka ke jila or satr nyaayadhish pi krishna bhatta ke khilaaf phir se jaanch shuru karaane ko mudda banaaya he
 Justice Chelameswar alleges that Chief Justice Justice Mishra has given instructions to the Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court, Dinesh Maheshwari to come under pressure at the behest of the central government
 varanaa supreme court colegium kii sifarish ke baad hycourt ke chif justise kaa apane man se phir se jaanch shuru karne kaa koi tuk nahin he
 In a 5-page letter sent to all judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Chelameswar has written that while the Supreme Court Collegium has twice recommended Bhatt to be appointed as the judge of the Karnataka High Court twice in August and November 2016
 jab-jab sifarish sarkaar tak pahunchati he bhatta ke saath kaam kar chuki ek mahila nyaayik adhikari ke aaropon kii fehrist bhatta ke khilaaf khadi milti he
 The last time the government sent back the museum's recommendation to make Judge Bhatt a judge, then CJI Justice Tirath Singh Thakur had got Justice Shubhra Kamal Mukherjee, Chief Justice, before Justice Maheshwari
 tab jaj bhatta ko clinit mili thi
 Actually, a woman judicial officer had made allegations of harassment against Judge Bhatt
 justise mukherjee kii clin chit ke baad jab jab bhatta ke hoicourt jaj banane kii file aage badhati he supreme court or sarkaar tak un mahila adhikari kii chitthiyaan pahunchnaa shuru ho jaati hai
 With the discussion on Justice Chelameswar's letter, the leaders of some opposition parties are secretly speaking in the corridors of Parliament that some of the mps who signed the impeachment motion against Chief Justice Deepak Mishra are gradually increasing, That is, the crisis is further aggravated when the competition is on two fronts simultaneously

 This is a theory related to the bunker but it can only be officially confirmed after investigation

 amitabh bachchan kii film kaa ye rimek varjan saal 2012 main relies hua tha
 All the characters of the film were quite popular
 vahiin movie ke gaanen aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par rahete hai
 On the completion of 7 years of Agneepath, the film's lead actor Hrithik Roshan shared a photo on Instagram
 ruthik ne ek video share kiya he, jisamen ve harivansh raay bachchan kii kavita, agnipath padhate hue najar aa rahe hai
 The film was made in the name of this poem in the year 1990, in which Amitabh Bachchan was in the lead role
 video ke saath hi ruthik ne film ke rimek varjan kii shooting ke kuch photose bhi saajha kiye hai
 He wrote in the caption, "agneepath was nothing short of a big opportunity for me
 film kii script kisi bhi actor ke liye sab kuch khone kii ek varning kii tarah thi
 Even to his bones
 aise hi role kii main talash kar rahaa tha
 Otherwise, i was not less than a lazy person during that time
 ''view this post on instagramagneepath gave me the opportunity of going all guns blazing
 Rarely does a script come along which warrants the actor to risk everything
 Including his bones
 Those are the kind of roles i look for
 Otherwise I’m just the laziest guy
 i was shooting for ZNMD in Spain when Karan Johar sent Karan malhotra to narrate the script inspite of me very vehemently turning down the idea of a remake of the classic
 
 He was right
 
 Cause after i heard the narration, i just couldn't say no
 
 Rest is history
 
 Had some fun while meditating on the poem today with my phone
 
 And right now all i want to do for the rest of my life is action movies

 ab aaj se aage main sirf ection filmon main hi kaam karuunga
 Hrithik's next film is Super 30
 film main ve bihar kii koching institute super 30 ke sansthaapak anand kumaar kaa role play karte hue najar aaenge
 The film was initially going to be released on January 25 but its release was shifted to further
 november ke pehle hafte main baari talkhi or ghamaasan ke bich samaajawaadee party ke rajat jayanti samaaroh main jab uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantrikhilesh yadavamanch par bolne aae to unhone mahaj ek line main apane samarthakon or virodhiyon ko bada sandesh diya
 Akhilesh said, 'when the sword is in your hand, remember it i will also run it'
 akhilesh kaa ye rup mukhyamantri ke pad par unki tajposhi ke vakt ke rup se bilkul vipareet tha
 Five years ago, when Akhilesh was sworn in as Chief Minister, he was deemed less Chief Minister and more 'tipu' sitting under the umbrella of his father, uncle and mouth-watering figures
 lekin aaj akhilesh na sirf upi ke sabase lokapriy netaaon main shumaar hai balki tamaam survey main unhen siem pad par janata kii pehali pasand bataaya ja rahaa he
 Politics are surprised to see his new look and confidence
 lekin unke is kuch kar guzarane ke liye ade dikhne ke peeche kuch thos vajah bhi hai
 Not SP government Akhilesh Sarkar Five years ago, when the Samajwadi Party won the historic victory and held power in UP, there were apprehensions among the media and public about the law and order of UP
 paanch saal purana mulaayam kaa raaj sabake saamne tha
 It was also believed that the name of Akhilesh is going to be the Chief Minister, so his clear image or good intentions will not have much effect, but such fears later proved to be wrong
 upi kii kanoon vyavastha aaj puri tarah sudhar gai aisa to nahin kaha ja saktaa lekin mayaraj kii tulana main usamen giravat ai ho aisa bhi dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 Especially when Akhilesh is considered inexperienced, Mayawati is considered a strict administrator
 vikaas kii bazkhilesh yadav jaanate hai ki sapa kaa paramparaagat yadav-muslim gathjod vaala formula har samay vot nahin dilaa saktaa
 The party got its lesson in the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 too, where it swept almost the entire state
 ye shaayad loksabhaa chunaav kaa sabak hi he ki akhilesh apni har sabha or kaarykram main vikaas kii baat karte dikhaai dete hai
 While Akhilesh went with the Kranti Rath in the last election, this time he named his chariot as the Socialist Development Chariot
 sandesh saaf he ki akhilesh ke chunavi plan main sabase upar vikaas hi rahane vaala he
 Youth leadership: Akhilesh is young and his idea of distributing laptops in the last election to woo the youth was a super hit
 sarkaar banane ke baad bhi unhone is nae-nae voter banane vaale varg ko lubhaane ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi
 Now that his tenure is about to end, he has announced to share the smartphone this time like a laptop
 svachh chhavikhilesh yadav sarkaar ke alag-alag mantriyon par jarur karpshan ke aarope lage hai
 His uncle, Shivpal and Ram Gopal were caught by it, but no such big case has come out against Akhilesh himself, which would have affected his image
 khaskar daagi mantriyon ko unhone jis tarah baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya or shivpal yadav sarkaar se alag hue usase bhi unki chhavi majboot hi hui he
 With Dimple, say that wife Dimple Yadav is as important to Akhilesh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party as Priyanka Gandhi would not be wrong for the Congress
 balki dimple chunki party se saansad bhi hai yani raajnneetik rup se puri tarah sakriy hai isliye wo priyanka ke mukaable votaron ko lubhaane main zyada mustaidi se kaam kar sakati hai
 Akhilesh and Dimple being on stage together, Dimple's traditional daughter-in-law avatar has a magical effect on rural voters
 kaala hiran shikaar maamle 19 disambar ko hogi agali sunwaayeesalman ke vakil ne court ke saamne pesh kiye do aplikeshankala hiran shikaar maamle main salmaan khan jodhpur court main shuukravaar ko pesh nahin hue
 The next hearing of the case will be held on 19 December
 sunwaayee ke dauraan vakil ne kaha ki salmaan khan ko hameshaa ke liye apil ke dauraan peshi se chhot di jaae
 a strange situation arose during the hearing when the lawyer asked whether he wanted to call Salman Khan to see his face
 salmaan khan ke vakil kaa ye bayaan sunakar jaj ne chaunkate hue kaha- kya main? baat ko sambhalate hue salmaan khan ke vakil ne kaha nahin main baaki logon kii baat kar rahaa hum kya vah salmaan khan kaa cheharaa dekhnaa chaahate hai
 He pointed lightly to his opposing lawyers standing nearby in gestures
 iske baad salmaan khan ke vakil ne court ke saamne do aplicoshan pesh kiye gaye
 One said that present day apology should be granted because he is busy shooting for the film, so cannot come
 or duusare aplicoshan main yah kaha ki unhen hameshaa ke liye apil ke dauraan peshi se chhot di jaae
 Arguing in the court, Salman Khan's lawyer said - Salman Khan does not have to be present during the appeal hearing
 jab sunwaayee puri ho jaaegi tab vah aa jaaenge
 On this, the public prosecutor said that this happens during the trial and not by appeal
 is baat par jaj sahab ne kaha- thik he iskaa pareekshan kara lete hai agali taarikh disambar main de dete hai
 So Salman Khan's lawyer Mahesh Bora said that no sir, people are not in the mood for work during the holidays, you give it in January
 jaj sahab ne kaha ki janvari bahut lanbaa ho jayega, sunwaayee main deree ho jaaegi
 Please give it in December
 salmaan khan ke vakil ne kaha ki chhuttiyon main mushkil ho jaati he
 People also go out for a walk
 is par jaj sahab ne kaha ki chhuttiyaan to 21 disambar ko hogi, aap 19 disambar kaa date le lijie or uske baad aap free ho jaaenge
 In this way, the date of December 19 has been kept for hearing in Salman Khan's case
 is dauraan bishnoi samaaj ke vakil mahipal bishnoi ne kaha- salmaan khan ke vakil kii taraf se court main jo dastavej pesh kiye gaye hai usamen kuch news kating bhi he
 In which it is said that Salman Khan is in danger of coming on muscle in Jodhpur
 isaki jaanch karai jaae
 Because whenever Salman Khan has to appear, some threat gets found on social media
 isaki naa to police main complaint hoti he or naa hi kuch hota he
 Whenever it has to be presented, then it is threatened pakistani khufia agency ISI ke liye jasusi karne ke aaropee chaar logon ko hiraasat main liya he

 The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee is concerned that if India joins the RCEP treaty, the country's agricultural sector will be severely affected
 itnaa hi nahin bharat kaa deyari udyog puri tarah se barbaad ho jayega
 Farmers' organizations have strongly objected to India's involvement in the RCEP
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki ye sandhi hoti he to desh ke ek tihaai bazaar par newjiland, america or europea deshon kaa kabja ho jayega or bharat ke kisaanon ko inke utpaada kaa jo mulya mil rahaa he, usamen giravat aa jaaegi

 kisaan sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki bharat main zyaadaatar kisaanon ke paas 2 se 4 gaay hai, jinke doodh se unka parivaar chalata he
 On the other hand, New Zealand farmers have 1000–1000 cows

 sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv baan kii moon ke bhaashan ke ek din baad america videsh mantri jon kairi ne bhi america ke navnirvaachit raashtrapati donald trump se jalwaayu parivartan ke mudde par peeche na hatane ko kaha
 Pointing to Trump's threat, Carrie said that there is a lot to be said in the election campaign , but issues have to be looked at differently when he takes office
 trump apane chunaav prachaar ke dauraan jalwaayu parivartan ke khatre ko hauvva bataate rahe hai or unhone ye kaha ki vah raashtrapati banane ke baad america ko pichley saal hui paris deal se baahar nikaal lenge
 But in Morocco, the US Secretary of State, describing the dangers of climate change as a truth, said that the whole world, including America, would have to fight it
 kairi ne trump ke bayaan kii ore ishaara karte hue kaha, 'jalwaayu parivartan sammelan shuru hone ke saath hi mere desh main ek chunaav hua or mujhe pataa he ki isse kai logon ke dimag main bhavishya ko lekar anischitata he
 i do not know and cannot say here what policies our new president will adopt, but i can say this to you
 jitna samay maine saarvajanik jivan main bitaayaa he usamen ek baat sikhi he ki chunaav prachaar main bayaan dena alag baat he lekin satta main aane ke baad kuch vishay aapako bilkul alag tareeke se dekhne hote hai
 ' isse pehle mangalvaar ko sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv baan kii moon ne bhi kaha tha unhen ummid he ki donald trump apane 'chunavi bayaan' kii phir se samiksha karenge
 Carrie referred to the market for solar energy and clean energy sources on the lines of Moon's speech on Tuesday, and said that the rules of the game would decide the market, not the governments
 tippaniyan Carrie, in her hour-long speech, mentioned the cooperation of all countries and Obama's role in the Paris Deal and said that if nothing was done in the matter of environment and climate change, it would be a 'moral failure'
 zaahir he paris main hue samjhaute ke mahatv or tamaam deshon kii patibaddhta ko dekhte hue trump par chautarafa dabaav banane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Under the Paris deal, the US will not only have to reduce its coal and shale gas use, but it also has the responsibility to help the poor and developing countries with money and technology
 trump janvari main america ke raashtrapati kaa kaarybhaar sanbhaalane vaale hai or is baat par sabaki nazar he ki vah is patibaddhta ko maanenge yaa paris deal se america ko baahar kar denge
 Trump, during his election campaign, has been calling out the threat of climate change and said that he would pull the US out of the Paris deal last year after becoming president
 lekin morocco main america videsh mantri ne jalwaayu parivartan ke khataron ko ek sachai bataate hue kaha ki america samet puri duniya ko isse ladanaa hoga
 Carrie pointed to Trump's statement, saying, "with the commencement of the climate change conference, there was an election in my country and i know that there is uncertainty about the future in the minds of many people
" main nahin jaanata or yahaan par nahin kah saktaa ki hamaare nae raashtrapati kya nitiyaan apanaayenge, lekin main aapse ye baat kah saktaa hum
 In the time i have spent in public life, i have learned one thing that it is a different thing to make a statement in an election campaign, but after coming to power, some subjects have to be seen in a completely different way
 ' Earlier on Tuesday, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon also said he hoped Donald Trump would revisit his 'election statement'
 kairi ne mangalvaar ko die moon ke bhaashan kii tarj par hi saura urja or saaf suthri urja se jude sadhano ke bazaar kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki khel ke niyam ab sarkarein nahin balki bazaar tay karegaa

 The Kerala government will write a letter to PM Modi against the decision to ban the purchase or sale of cattle for slaughterhouses in any animal market in the country
 sutron se pataa chalaa he ki kerala ke mukhyamantri pinarai vijayan is masale par piemo ko khat likh sakate hai
 The state government will make any changes in the existing rules on cattle and slaughterhouses only after receiving a response to the letter
 vahiin kendriya mantri menka gandhi ne centre ke is faisle ko kisaanon ke hit main bataaya he
 Maneka said, the government has already supported the existing law
 garib-kisaan honge prabhavit: cmsiema vijayan kaa kahana he ki agar aaj maweshiyon ko maarane par pabandi laga di ja rahi he, to kal machhlee khaane par bhi roak laga di jaaegi
 The new rules of the Center will affect the employment of poor, dalits and farmers
 faisle ke khilaaf hoga bif fest kaa aayojanaparyaaran mantralay ke nae niyamon ke khilaaf student federation of india, CPM youth wing kerala ke 200 sthanon parabiffest yojit karne ja rahaa he
 This decision of the government is also being opposed in Tamil Nadu
 visike party netaa ne sarkaar ko alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf bataate hue is faisle ko aresas kaa agenda qaraar diya
 The Ministry of Environment has notified the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules 2017
 is notification kaa makasad maveshi bazaar main jaanwaron kii kharid- bikri ko regulate karne ke saath maweshiyon ke khilaaf krurta rokna he
 After this notification, according to the rules, those who buy or sell cattle in the market must ensure that the cattle are not brought into the market to buy or sell for the purpose of killing
 iske liye kharidne or bechney vaale donon ko animal market kamity ke member secretary ko ek anderteking dena padegaa
 Without the approval of the State Conservation Law, the buyer will not be able to sell the cattle outside the state either
 paryaavaran mantri harshavardhan kaa kahana hai ki gaay, sand, bhens, bail, bachade, oont jaise jaanavar is category main aate hai
 However these rules are for the market and the individual buying and selling of cattle is not made explicit in this
 boojadkhaanon ke liye 50 se 60 fisadi jaanavar inhen maveshi bazaaron se aate hai
 Therefore, the trade of meat will be affected after the notification
 is notification main bazaar kii paribhaasha ko saaf karte hue bataaya gaya ki jahaan alag-alag jagahon se jaanavar bechney yaa nilaamee ke liye laae jate hai
 There will be a District Animal Market Monitoring Committee at the district level
 iske alaava sthaneey str par animal market cameti banegi
 The notification clearly states that the buyer must also ensure that he is taking the cattle for the purpose of farming
 kharidaar ko ye ghoshnaptr dena hoga ki vah 6 maheene tak maveshi ko nahin bechega
 Henceforth cattle cannot be sacrificed for religious purposes

 Actually, the man took off his clothes and sat in the middle of the street meditating
 maamla china ke henon praant kaa he
 This Russian student, studying at Henan University, reached the road to meditate for peace of mind, where he stripped off all his clothes one by one and became naked
 uske sharir par sirf dhooma kaa chashma or ek chen bachi thi
 Seeing him, the people passing by there could not live without laughter and they started to take pictures of him
 isse yuvak ko itnaa gussa aa gaya ki usne kuch logon ko middle finger bhi dikhaai
 The boy could not be identified
 uske munh main blade bhi thi or vah baad main uskaa iraadaa khudakushi karne kaa tha
 When the police arrived to clear the crowd, he was also asked to leave
 lekin usne inkaar kar diya or phir police use apni gaadi main bithakar apane saath le gai
 The drama did not end here only
 police stesan pahunchane par ladakane ne gaadi se bhi utarane se manaa kar diya
 When Nitish Kumar was campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections and was doing everything he could, he may not have had the slightest idea that he might have to relinquish power after the results
 unke ghoshit pratidwandvi narendra modi ne jis tarah dhobi paat lagaakar unhen dhul chataayee or do siton par samet diya, usne nitish ko haar kii 'naitik jimmedaari lene’ or pad chhodie par majaboor kar diya
 Time was very important in all this game
 shanivaar ko achaanak ai nitish ke istife kii khabar ne logon ko chaunkaaya to jarur lekin asal main yah unki rajnatik chaturaai kii ek or misaal sabit hui
 "after such a drastic defeat, Nitish needed some time to handle it," says a JD (U) strategist
 ve mukhyamantri kii kursi par nahin rah sakate the kyonki isse satta paksh or vipaksh, donon main unke virodhiyon ko or masala mil jaataa
 Nor could they afford the new assembly election because the mood of the people was clear that the BJP would win
 aise main ek hi rasta tha ki chaalaaki bhari chaal chali jaae
 He took two steps backward to take a quantum leap in the future
 nitish ne loksabhaa ke nattejey aane ke agle hi din istipha de diya, tab tak to chunavi nateezon kii sahi padtaal bhi nahin ho saki thi
 This was a ploy to suppress the party even before the revolt and they managed it
 jo log unki naak main dam kar sakate the, sab ke sab virodh chhodie par majaboor ho gaye
 Now all the dissatisfied are compelled to eat their loyalty and walk according to them
 ”istipha dene ke baad bhi nitish kii pau baarah he
 Even though there was dust in 2014, he had given 32 out of 40 seats to NDA in 2009 Lok Sabha elections and 243 seats in 2010 assembly elections
 unhone haar kii naitik jimmedaari lekar or mahadalit vidhayak jithan ram maanjhi ko gaddi saunpkar party main tamaam aalochakon kaa munh band kar diya
 Nitish now sits on the throne of morality as he not only relinquished the throne but also empowered a Mahadalit
 is chaal ne loksabhaa chunaav main unki raajnneeti ko thukraa chuke logon main se bhi kuch kii sahanubhuti dilaane main madad kii he
 Manjhi's greatest merit is his weak political penetration, perhaps because of which Nitish has chosen him as the heir
 tamaam vikalpon main se 69 varshiya maanjhi main itani takat nahin he ki ve aane vaale maheenon main nitish ko chunauti de paaen
 The biggest thing is that Nitish will continue to show the way to Manjhi and this series is expected to run till the assembly elections in November 2015
 nitish vidhansabha chunaav main party kaa netritv karne par sahamat ho gaye hai
 Nitish has called Manjhi an able successor, but he was the one who resigned from him in November 2005, just hours after joining him in the cabinet
 vajah: shiksha vibhaag main aniyamitata ko lekar nigaraanee vibhaag kii jaanch main unke naam kaa aana
 In April 2008, Manjhi again got a place in Nitish's cabinet only after being discharged
 lekin uske baad bhi ve nitish kii najaron main nahin chadh sake
 In June 2012, he publicly slammed Manjhi in his weekly Janata Darbar
 maanjhi ne naukari kii guhaar lagane vaale ek yuvak ke aavedan par hastakshar kar die the, jise dekh nitish ne unhen jhadap lagaai thi
 The JD (U) fielded a total of 38 candidates in the 2004 election, but won only two
 is haar ke liye unke ganit kii baari chook jimmedaar he
 In June 2013, when Nitish broke with the BJP, he thought that political mathematics would support him
 unhone 17 fisadi musalmaan or 12 fisadi mahadaliton ko jodakar jo atipichhadaa samudaay banaaya tha or jise dhyaan main rakhkar yojanaayen chalaayin thim, unhone kam-se-kam kaagaj par unhen ajey dikhaaya tha
 But in the first round of voting, when there were indications that Muslim voters were moving towards lalu-congress alliance and some backward people were leaving them and leaning towards Modi, then it became clear that their mathematics had backfired
 lekin chunaav nateezon ke chakravyuuh main fanse nitish ne fouran palatwaar kiya
 Since 2005, party president Sharad Yadav, standing silently in Nitish's shadow, seized the opportunity and started making plans to shore up Nitish beaten by voters
 shanivaar ko nitish ne sharad yadav se baat kii to istipha dene kii salaah mili
 Looking for a chance to increase his stature at the national level, Sharad Yadav approached Lalu Yadav through his trusted intermediaries and threw the dice of the Secular Front to stop the bjp's lead
 lalu maan to gaye par shart rakh di ki pehle nitish ko hataao
 This condition was also favorable to Sharad Yadav
 nitish ne istipha to de diya tha lekin lalu se haath milaane kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakate the kyonki isse to ve or haashie par chale jate
 The JD (U) mlas opposed Sharad's formula after the Nitish faction encouraged them to back down
 phir bhi 67 varshiya party adhyaksh ne nitish se istipha to dilava hi liya
 After leaving the chair, Nitish's first task was to remove the thorn in the path of Manjhi, only then the path of his own return could be cleared
 philhal ve kaamyaab rahe hai
 Three RJD mlas and two BJP mlas have resigned from the House taking the strength of the Assembly to 237
 maanjhi ko sarkaar bachaane ke liye 119 vidhayakon kaa samarthan chahie
 Apart from 117 JD (U) mlas, he confirmed two independents as ministers and confirmed them
 ab sarkaar bachaane ke liye congress kii jarurat nahin he
 Nitish has also closed alliances with Lalu
 loksabhaa chunaav main unki party ko bhale hi 15
 7 per cent of the votes, but he hopes that Nitish's credibility will be successful in getting votes in the 2015 assembly elections
 iske liye agle 15 maah main maanjhi ko kuch karke dikhaanaa hoga
 Although this seems easy to say
 20 may ko rajbhavan kii batti gul ho jane kii vajah se nae mukhyamantri ko shapath lete-lete bich main ruknaa padaa
 The same thing happened in Nitish's press conference in June 2013, when his announcement of breaking ties with the BJP had caused a power loss and it had suddenly become dark
 apane bhaashan ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne hira kaarobaari neerav modi dwaara bank ke saath hui dhokhebaaji kaa bhi zikr kiya

 Wrestling can be called India's most successful Olympic sport after shooting success in recent times
 lekin, world championships or olympic kii badi kamyaabi Despite this the game is in ruins
 iske karta−dharta corporate sector or rajya sarkaron se madad kii guhaar laga rahe hai
 Amit Kumar and Bajrang Punia won the medals in freestyle in the first World Championship of Wrestling in Hungary kaayam kiye
 Then Sunil Yadav of Banaras surprised everyone by winning India's first medal in the greco-roman category
 yah or baat he ki in sabake baavjood bhartiya kushti sangh ek maamuli sammaan samaaroh main rajat padak vijeta amit kumaar ko paanch lakh rupee or kaansya padak vijeta bajrang puniya or sandip yadav ko teen-teen lakh rupee hi de paaya
 Wrestling Association President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh says, what should we do more than this
 hamaare paas paise hi nahin hai
 Such an event also costs nine-ten lakh rupees
 ye hi bahut mushkil se kar pate hai
 Amit Kumar and Bajrang Punia, who have won medals at the World Championships, wrestle their wrestling skills under the direction of Mahabali Satpal at the Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi
 bhartiya kushti main zyaadaatar kamyaabi haryana or dilli ke pahalawaanon ke zariye aa rahi he
 However, players and officials emphasize that the bench strength of the Indian team is good
 dabl olympic padak vijeta susheel or landan olympic main kaansya padak vijeta yogeshwar kehete hai ki ab sabhi wet category main achche pahalwaan hai
 So our bench strength is good, but they all believe that more wrestling centers are needed in the country
 mahabali satpal bhi kehete hai, chhatrasaal stadium jaise or bhi centre khulen to hamen or bhi tallent hasil hoga or padakon kii jhadi lag jaaegi
 The comments kushti sangh ke adhikari kehete hai ki na to rajya sarkarein or na hi corporate sector is khel kii madad ke liye taiyaar he
 In such a situation, they are still facing a lot of problems at the basic level
 hairaani kii baat he ki shandaar kamyaabi ke baad bhi ye khel corporate sector or glamer kii apni ore khinchne main naakaam rahaa he
 The Wrestling Federation of India says that it is pushing, but it is still falling short
 hungary main hui kushti kii world championships main pehle amit kumaar or bajrang puniya ne free style main padak jeet kar itihaas Set up
 phir banaras ke sunil yadav ne greeko roman varg main bharat kaa pehali baar padak jeet kar sabko hairaan kar diya It is another matter that despite all this, the Indian Wrestling Association was able to give silver medalist Amit Kumar five lakh rupees and bronze medalists Bajrang Punia and Sandeep Yadav only three lakh rupees in a modest honor ceremony
 kushti sangh ke adhyaksh brijbhushan sharan singh kehete hai, ham isse zyada kya karen
 We have no money
 is tarah ke aayojan main bhi nau−das lakh rupee lag jate hai
 These are very difficult to do
 world championships main padak jeetne vaale amit kumaar or bajrang puniya dilli ke chhatrasaal stadium main mahabali satpal ke nirdesan main kushti kaa hunar maanjte hai
 Most of the success in Indian wrestling is coming through wrestlers from Haryana and Delhi
 lekin, khilaadi or adhikari is baat par jor dete hai ki bhartiya team kii bench strength acchhee he
 Double Olympic medalist Sushil and London Olympic bronze medalist Yogeshwar say that now all are good wrestlers in the weight category
 isliye hamaari bench strength acchhee he, lekin ye sabhi maanate hai desh main or bhi kushti ke centre kii zarurat he
 Mahabali Satpal also says, if more centers are opened like Chhatrasal Stadium then we will get more talent and there will be a spurt of medals
 tippaniyan Officials of the wrestling association say that neither the state governments nor the corporate sector is ready to help the sport
 aise main buniyadi str par inhen ab bhi bahut dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Surprisingly, the game has failed to attract the corporate sector and glamor even after the spectacular success
 bhartiya kushti sangh kaa kahana he ki vah jor to laga rahaa he lekin uskaa jor ab bhi kam pad rahaa he
 Amit Kumar and Bajrang Punia, who have won medals at the World Championships, wrestle their wrestling skills under the direction of Mahabali Satpal at the Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi

 kanpur ke green park maidan par bharat or newjiland ke bich pehla test match 22 sitambar se shuru ho rahaa he
 If Team India will play for the 500th match of their cricket history, then it is also a very special match for Indian cricket
 muqabla bhartiya pich he lihaaja yahaan spinners kaa bolbalaa hoga yah anumaan lagaana kathin nahin he
 The history of the Test played at the Green Park ground is a witness to the fact that Indian spinners have been dominating the matches played here in the past
 yani ek baar phir viraat kii captaini main khel rahi team india kii spin tikdi aswin, jadeja or amit mishra ke pradarshan par nazren tiki hongi
 This will be the third Test between India and New Zealand in 1976 at Bedi, Chandrashekhar, Raghavan at Nachayagreen Park Stadium
 1976 main donon tiimon ke bich hue pehle mukaable kii pehali pari main openar glen turnar ke shatak ke baavjood kiwi ballebaaj bhartiya spin tikdi bishan singh bedi, bies chandrashekhar or es venkatraghavan ke saamne sangharsh karte rahe
 All three took six wickets among themselves
 duusari pari main bhi in teenon ne puraani gend se newjiland ke top order ballebaajon ko apni phiraki se baandhe rakhaa
 However tail Kiwi batsmen WK Lease and d o'sullivan somehow managed to draw this test
 1999 main jambo, turbanetor, joshi ke 16 attackiske baad 1999 main stephen fleming kii captaini main newjiland duusari baar ledar capital ke naam se mashhoor is audyogic shahar ke green park stadium main bharat ke saamne tha
 Indian spinners once again dominated this Test match under the captaincy of Sachin Tendulkar
 team india ke vartmaan head coach anil kumble ne tab bhartiya akraman kii bagdor sanbhali or shandaar pradarshan kiya
 In the match, Kumble took 10 wickets and the Indian team defeated New Zealand by eight wickets in just four days
 tab spin tikdi ke do anya gendbaajon harbhajan singh or sunil joshi the
 Bhajji took four and Joshi took two important wickets
 yani kul milakar 16 wicket isi spin tikdi kii jholii main gai
 Virat Kohli will make Virat Kohli, Jadeja, Mishra's trio of Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson in the third match on this ground from September 22 will be no different than the last two matches
 kohli ke paas bhi of spinner ravichandran aswin, rabindra jadeja or leg spinner amit mishra ke rup main spin tikdi maujuud he
 Ashwin is just seven steps away from taking his 200th wicket in his 37th Test, so he is expected to perform strongly in this Test
 saath hi wo abhi pichhali hi gharelu siries main dakshin africa ke khilaaf chaar test maichon main unke 31 wicket to sabhi ke jehan main taaja he
 In the same series, only 17 Test old Ravindra Jadeja also took 23 wickets
 20 test kaa anubhav liye amit mishra bhi kuch kam nahin hai
 In that series against Africa, Mishra played two Test matches and took seven wickets but also bowled a batsman like de Villiers twice
 lihaaja is test siries ke dauraan yah bhartiya spin tikdi ke pradarshan par bhi nirbhar karata he ki match kitne dinon main simatega
 In 2012, Ashwin took 18 wickets, before the last time in 2012 when the New Zealand team visited India, under the captaincy of Dhoni, the Indian team defeated Ross Taylor's team in both the matches
 do test maichon kii us gharelu siries ko bharat ko 2-0 se jitaane ke dauraan aswin or pragyan ojha ne aapas main 31 wicket baante
 Ashwin took 18 wickets in the series and Ojha 13
 kiwi team bhi spin tikdi se he susajjitakiwi captain ken williamsan bharat pahunchane ke saath hi siries ke dauraan spinning trek milane ko lekar apni ashanka jataa chuke hai
 That is why the Kiwi team has also come equipped with a spin trio
 unke tarkash main leg spinner ish sodhi, orthodox of spinner mark craig or baayen haath ke spinner mishael centner hai
 His spin trio bowled a lot during the practice session at Kotla
 is dauraan mark craig ko nai ball bhi thamai gai
 So, it is understandable that Kiwi think tank can start bowling with its spinners as well
 28 saalon se bharat main nahin jeeta he newjiland2012-13 main england se mili haar ke sivaa pichley chah saalon main team india ne apane aath home siries main se saat jite hai
 Whereas New Zealand has got only two wins on Indian pitches
 pehali 1969 main vidarbha main to duusari 1988 main vankhede main
 That is, New Zealand is looking for a Test win in India for the last 28 years
 kanpur ke baad kolkata or indore main bhi test khele jaaenge lekin bhartiya spin tikdi, majboot ballebaaji kram or captain kohli ke rup main cricket ke viraat yoddha ko dekhte hue philhal kiwi team ko ek adad jeet ke liye intjaar hi karnaa padegaa
 India will remain number-1 in the rankings This series of three Test matches between India and New Zealand can also take Team India to number-1 in the Test rankings
 westeindies main chaar test maichon kii siries 2-0 se jitkar kohli kii sena isisi test ranking main number-2 ke paaydaan par kabiz ho gai he
 This Test series between the two teams ends on October 12
 iske thik ek din baad yani 13 oktober se pakistan or westeindies ke bich test siries shuru hoga
 Meanwhile no other countries will play Tests
 iskaa matlab he ki siries kii shuruyaat jeet ke saath karne ke saath hi bharat ke ek baar phir test ranking main top par pahunchane kii sambhaavna prabal ho jaaegi
 Dengue has caused uproar across the country
 kahin aspataalon main bed nahin hone kii khabaren aa rahi hai to kahin sahi ilaaj or dawa ke abhaav main sankadon logon kii jaan chali gai he

 Researchers said that during 1997 and 1998, historically the most potent El Niño phenomenon, eight countries in Southeast Asia saw an increase in dengue cases
 tippaniyan Professor Derek Cummings of the University of Florida said, 'dengue affects a large number of people in this tropical region every year, although their cases increase year by year

 Before the Supreme Court hearing on the birth date of Army Chief General VK Singh, the Ministry of Defense has asked the Army's attached branch (adjutant Generals) to indicate Singh's birth year 1950
 agi kii shakha ko is aashya kaa patr pichley hafte bheja gaya, jisamen kaha gaya he ki general singh kii janmatithi 10 may, 1950 darshai jaae
 The Army record-keeping branch records Singh's birth date as May 10, 1951, while the military secretary's branch records May 10, 1950
 yah kadam donon tithiyon ko samaan darshane tathaa singh ke prati sarkaar ke kade rukh ko darshata he, jo maamle ko sheersh nyaayalay main le gaye hai
 The case is to be heard on 3 February
 senadhyaksh ke daawey ko thukaraate hue raksha mantralay ne 21 july ke apane pehle aadesh main agi kii shakha se kaha tha ki vah general singh kaa janmavarsh 1950 darj kare
 In its decision of 21 July, the Ministry of Defense declared that the February 25 order of the Adjutant General (manpower and Employment) as 'ineffective and illegal', amending the date of birth of Singh to May 10, 1951 instead of amending May 10, 1950
 Instructions were given
 tippaniyan Soon after the order was issued by the Ministry, the Chief of the Army made a legal complaint to the Defense Minister AK Antony, saying that his date of birth was considered May 10, 1951
 sena mukhyalay ne baad main khule taur par is faisle par yah kehete hue sawaal uthaaya ki hiskool ke pramaan patr main ullikhit tithi kii andekhi nahin kii ja sakati
 He said that the Ministry of Defense took the decision on the issue based on the information given to him by the MS branch, whereas such issues do not come under the jurisdiction of this branch
 raksha mantralay se 30 disambar ko shikaayat khaarij hone ke baad general singh ne ucchtam nyaayalay kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 If 1950 is considered to be the year of his birth, General Singh will have to step down on May 31 this year, while on May 10, 1951, he will be able to remain in office for another 10 months
 sena kaa record rakhane vaali shakha ne singh kii janmatithi 10 may, 1951 darshai he, jabaki sainya sachiv kii shakha ke record main yah 10 may, 1950 darj he
 The move reflects both dates equally and the government's stern attitude towards Singh, who has taken the matter to the apex court
 maamle kii sunwaayee 3 farvari ko honi he
 Rejecting the Army Chief's claim, the Defense Ministry, in its first order of July 21, had asked the ag's branch to record General Singh's birth year 1950

 The comments mantralay dwaara aadesh jari hone ke turant baad senadhyaksh ne yah kehete hue rakshaamantri eke antni se vaidhanik shikaayat kii ki unki janmatithi 10 may 1951 maani jaae
 The Army Headquarters later openly questioned the decision, saying that the date mentioned in the high school certificate could not be ignored
 usne kaha ki raksha mantralay ne emes shakha dwaara use di gai jaankaree ke aadhaar par mudde par yah faisla kiya, jabaki is shakha ke kshetradhikaar main aise mudde nahin aate
 On December 30, General Singh approached the Supreme Court after the complaint was dismissed from the Ministry of Defense
 1950 ko yadi unke janm kaa varsh mana jaataa he, to general singh ko is saal 31 may ko pad chhodana hoga, jabaki 10 may, 1951 maane jane par vah 10 maah or pad par rah sakenge
