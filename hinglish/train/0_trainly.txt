 " BJP leader LK Advani alleged that the Congress-led UPA government at the Center has tarnished the image of democracy and the country by indulging in corruption and saving corrupt people
 apni jan chetana yatra ke 18wein din yahaan ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue adwani ne kaha ki bhrashtachar kii ninda karne ke alaava unki yatra kaa uddeshy swiss bainkon main jamaa kalaadhan laane ke liye sarkaar ko baadhya karnaa he

 Advani said that he decided to visit when his colleagues in Parliament exposed the vote scam in exchange for the note
 aise bade ghotaale kaa pardaafash karne par unhen badhai dene or unka bachaav karne ke badale sarkaar ne unhen jail bhej diya
 He alleged that the UPA has tarnished democracy and the image of the country by bribing mps to get a majority in Parliament
 'bhrashtachar main sahyogi dalon ko fansaa rahi he sarkaar'adwani ne kaha ki bhaajapa ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf abhiyaan pichley saal sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main shuru kiya tha or sarkaar ko 2ji spectrum aavanton maamle main sanyukt sansadeey samiti gathit karne ke liye baadhya kiya
 He said that Congress is saving its leaders responsible for the scam by making allies a scapegoat
 hamen sahyogiyon ke saath koi sahanubhuti nahin he or sabhi bhrasht logon ko dandit kiya janaa chahie
 On the issue of money laundering by Advani against corruption, Advani said that all the six lakh villages of the country can be developed if the money deposited in Swiss banks is returned to Rs 25 lakh crore
 unhone kaha ki angrej shaskaon ne 200 saal ke shashan main ek lakh karod rupye lut liye vahiin bhrasht tatwon ne 60 saal main 25 lakh karod rupye le liye
 Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has put the Opposition in the dock, questioning the encounter of eight SIMI terrorists in Madhya Pradesh
 unhone kaha ki aatankiyon ke saath sahanubhuti kyon
 Answer the question first
 kyonki desh ke log iskaa jawaab chaahate hai
 Venkaiah Naidu also said that the history of the terrorists whose encounter took place is already bad
 They have already escaped by breaking jail and this time also ran away from the jail after killing a police constable in jail, hence the encounter has been done due to the circumstances
 Therefore, it is not in the interest of the country to give it political form and color of communalism
 venkaiya naidu ne yah bhi kaha ki congress party or uske sahyogi dalon se apil karata hum ki isko raajnneetik rang naa den kyonki isse desh kaa maahaul kharaab ho saktaa he meraa sawaal sirf itnaa he ki aatankwaadiyon ke saath itani sahanubhuti kyon? or simi ke saath itani sahanubhuti kyon? encounter kii nyaayik jaanch main sab kuch saaf ho jayega or kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 Venkaiah Naidu also said that we asked the Congress what they did on their time
 enie aatanki ghatnaon kii or aatankiyon kii jaanch karne vaali desh kii sabase badi agency he
 Should we ask terrorists, what is their caste, what is religion? The NIA DG should not question the circumstances under which his tenure has been shed
 bijepi saansad or purv mumbai police kamishnar satpal singh ne kaha ki desh main jo bhi encounter hote hai, us par sawaal khadey kiye jate hai, lekin hamen police par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Those who have been confronted in 2013 also fled from Khandwa jail
 police ne ection liya or 8 simi aatankiyon ko maar giraaya, ye kaabil-e-tarif he
 The MP said that if there is a judicial inquiry into the encounter, then everything will be known
 jail se inkaa bhaagna prashasan kii galati bataata he
 If he had run away after killing a constable, you would have said that the police did nothing, so the police should be congratulated
 satpal ne kaha ki jail se bhaagane ke baad sarkaar ne jail ke diji ko barkhaast kiya, ye acha kadam he
 On questioning the encounter, Satpal said that in the last 15 years, the maximum number of encounters have been in the Congress government in Maharashtra and Mumbai
 enie kaa gathan upie shasankaal main hua he
 Everyone is confident of the NIA, but they are saying that the tenure of the DG has been extended, so the investigation will not be impartial
 ye thik nahin he

 BJP leader and Supreme Court advocate Ajay Agarwal, who contested against Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, has written a letter to PM Modi, saying that he is unhappy
 kaha he-agar maine gujarat chunaav ke dauraanmanishankar ayyar ke jangpura sthit ghar par chah disambar 2018 kii shampakistani adhikariyon ke saath purv uparashtrapati hamid ansaari or purv piem manmohan singh kii hui meeting kaa khulaasa na kiya hota to bijepi yah chunaav shartiyon haar jaati
 PM Modi later spent this meeting held at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house at the election rallies connecting the security of the country, it is mentioned in his speeches
 iske chalate hue dhruvikaran ke sahare bijepi haarate hue bhi gujarat chunaav jeetne main safal rahi
 "according to Agarwal, even the top leaders of the Sangh themselves accept this
 apane daawey ke samarthan main ajay agarwal ne sangh ke sah sar kaarywah dattatreya hoshabhole ke saath phone par hui kathith baatcheet kaa audio bhi jari kiya he
 In which Dattatreya can be heard saying that the revelations (manmohan's meeting with the Pakistan High Commissioner) gave the BJP a Gujarat victory
 ajay agarwal ne piem modi ko likh patr main daawa kiya ki yadi nishpaksh chunaav honge to aap jo chaar sau siton kaa daawa kar rahe hai, uski jagadeshbhar main sirf 40 siton par bhi simat sakate he
 You should be ready to withstand this shock
 enditivi se baatcheet main ajay agarwal ne kaha ki unhone bahut dukhi man se yah chitthee piem modi ko likhi he
 i am writing this open letter to you to open the eyes of BJP workers and countrymen
 aapse meraa vyaktigat parichay lagbhag 28 varshon se he or 11 ashoka road (bhaajapa party offis) par maine or aapane kam se kam sau baar saath bhojan saath kiya hoga 
 At the time of detention, i wrote several letters to you continuously and told in it that the poor people are facing great inconvenience
 bank vaale bade kaale dhan vaale logon ke saath milakar 30% rishwat lekar thok main puraane note badal rahe hai or notebandi kaamyaab nahin ho rahi he 
 This is encouraging corruption openly
 jiesti kii lagu karne ke samay or uski khaamiyon ko lekar lagaataar likhata rahaa, parantu aapaki yaa aapke offis kii ore se aaj tak kisi bhi patr kaa koi uttar praapt nahin hua balki main aapaki naaraazgi kaa shikaar avashya ho gaya, kyonki aap desh ke sabase budhimaan vyakti he or aapako ko kisi ke suzav yaa koi bhi salaah mashwara kii aavashyaktaa nahin he tabhi to aapane notebandi kaa tughluqi farmaan sarkaar kii bina taiyaari ke jari kar diya tha or garib janata ko line main lagavakar marane ko majaboor kar diya
 You hoped that at least five lakh crores rupees would not be returned and that would be the income of the government, but 99% of the money was returned and there was a huge amount of fake notes in it which the bankers got in collusion with some people and deposited it
 There was no investigation or identification to date
 is prakaar bina tayari ke aapke tughluqi farmaan se desh ko kai lakh karod kaa chuunaa laga or kuch beyimaan bhrasht or chor logon ne bank ke adhikariyon ko bhrasht kar kai lakh karod kaa nuksaan desh ko laga diya
 As a true soldier of the party, whenever i felt that there was a need for reform, i kept writing directly to you on my email because i do not believe in flattery and a real statement to my leader, even if Prime Minister
 Nobody hesitates to do
 main aaj jo bhi hum keval apane or apane shubhachintakon ke balboote par hum 
 Whenever i have met the Union Ministers or the Ministers of Uttar Pradesh, it was found only for the development work of Rae Bareli that the development works are being ignored there
 parantu meri ediyaan kendriya mantriyon ke paas ghoomte ghoomte ghis gayi tab jaakar thoda bahut kaam main kara paaya
 It is absolutely necessary to mention the Gujarat Assembly Elections held in December 2017, because the political sacrifice of Honorable LK Advani was taken because of that election
 puure desh kii janata yah chaahati thi ki mananeey laalkrishna adwani ji ko desh kaa raashtrapati banaaya jaye
 a very senior BJP official told me that you had received feedback from various sources that you would lose the Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections and the Congress government would be formed there and that is why you replaced your Guru Advani ji a few months before the election
 But made Ramnath Kovind ji the President because he comes from Kori community and is very big of Koli society similar to his caste in Gujarat The vote Nkya that was voter Traditionally, the Congress and thought that if Ramnath Kovind then living to be made to the President of the society will get you your whole vote
 parantu iske baavjood bhi aap gujarat vidhansabha chunaav haar rahe the, or isaki jhalak chunaav prachaar ke dauraan aapke chehre par spasht dikhaai de rahi thi
 On the 9th of December, when the first phase of voting was going on, i revealed that you won the second phase on 14 December in many assembly constituencies where your first defeat was certain and your government was formed in Gujarat
 aapako bhalee bhaanti pataa he ki yah kya khulaasa tha
 But in order to tell the countrymen again, i am sending audio recordings of VDO recordings and conversation with me of Mr
 Dattatreya Hosabale, co-government of the Union, one of the senior most officials of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, in which he has said that because of my revelations In Gujarat, the party's "hanging defeat turned into victory" and they again said that this disclosure hit and we "won while losing" 
 is prakaran ke baad aapkaa meraa do baar aamanaa saamana hua
 i saw that you were stealing my eyes and i saw the same behavior of the national president, and then i became convinced that it is in your nature not to give credit to anyone and this is also called Khudgarshi or Ahsanframoshi
 mujhe phir aisa bhi mahasoos hua ki itane varshon ke pragadh parichay ke baad bhi aapkaa yah vyavhaar isliye to nahi ki aapako lag rahaa ho ki mujhe koi raajnneetik laabh na dena pade or chuki aaj party main koi bhi pad yaa daayitv vyakti kii yogyata nahin varan jaat paat dekhakar diya jaataa he or main vyapaaree samaaj se aata hum or aapaki soch ke anusaar ham vyapaaree samaaj aapkaa kor voter hi nahin , aapke gulam hai or hamaara koi rajanithik mahatv hi nahi he 
 You use other activists like me as a slave and the worker leaves his doorway and keeps working for 24 hours in the guise of your jumal and he does not get the respect he deserves
 are sochie ki agar congress sarkaar aapke grih rajya main hi arudh ho gai hoti jabaki aap desh ke pradhanmantri ke pad par asin hai to aap desh ko kya munh dikhaate 
 Apart from this, the file of criminal cases against you or the national president of BJP was also closed, the Congress government would have reopened and would have to stand in the category of an accused again and were circling the courts to protect themselves
 is patr ko likhane kaa mantavy yah tha ki abhi kuch din purv raibareli ke bhaajapa ke tikat kii ghoshnaa hui he jisamen aapane ek aparaadhik chhavi rakhane vaale vyakti ko party kaa tikat de diya, jabaki pichley teen chunaavon main maine bhaajapa ke raibareli chunaav main itihaas main sabase zyada 1,73,721 (ek lakh tihattar hajaar saat sau ikkis) vot praapt kar bhaajapa kii gandhi parivaar ke garh main pratishtha badhaai
 After the formation of your government in Gujarat, i met three senior BJP officials who are also my friends, and all three whipped me fiercely and asked why you made the mistake of forming their government in Gujarat, the whole party (BJP) was waiting for these people (modi + Shah) to lose the Gujarat elections, so that their ego is broken
 inhone aage mujhase yah bhi kaha tha ki aapane inke liye itnaa bada kaam kar diya parantu yah aapako bhi nahin puuchhenge
 Despite my total acceptance in Rae Bareli and the desire of most people to cut my ticket and insult me, it was my duty to put the facts before you and the countrymen and let me tell you that you are claiming to win 400 seats
 That if there is a fair election, then you can narrow even 40 seats across the country and keep yourself ready for this so that there is no mental trauma
 congress ne in khabaron ko koi tavajjo nahin di ki jharkhand ke purv mukhyamantri madhu kodaa kii diary main congress shubhachintakon ke naam shaamil hai

 Where there is no water, Asaram is fiercely watering Holi
 isapar sharmindagi to chhodie, turra dikhaa rahe hai
 When questioned about shedding water, they said, it is not water from anyone's father
 gujarat main apane bhakton ke saath holi manaate hue asaram ne vah kah diya jo ham likh bhi nahin sakate
 Just read what we can write
 asaram media ko kehete hai, kute bhunk rahe hai
 Here, they do not remain silent and say that we do not take water from the father of any government
 ab ye aap tay kiijie ki bhakthi ke naam se asaram ke shrimukh se nikali is bhashaa main preet he yaa paakhand
 The government of Maharashtra, which was struggling with the worst drought of 40 years, had just told this flag bearer of religion that Maharaj people are dying of thirst
 Do not shed water in the name of Holi
 lekin is apil par asaram kaa paara chadh gaya
 This demonstration of Asaram on the banks of the Tapi river has many times killed the generosity of spirituality
 apane ko baapu kehete hue asaram kehete hai ki baapu mung dal rahe hai or kute bhunk rahe hai
 Leave Maharashtra
 gujarat ke bhi 9 jile suukhaagrast hai
 Asaram was a tainted god of misfortune where people were worried about water
 hajaaron kii bheed bhakthi ke naam par sunati rahi maanav sabhyataa ke saath asaram ke aatank kii bhashaa
 In this colorful splash of water, he was dying of eye water
 asaram kehete hai ki bhagwaan hamaare saath he main to dil khol ke rang chhantoonga
 And now that thing of Asaram is a cheap and stupid joke for those who peep one by one to the bottom of the pitcher for water
 aasthaa ke naam par asaram ne saream ishwariya aapadaa kii khilli udayi thi
 The arrogance of pride in considering himself above God has snatched the man's eye from him
 bhagwaan ko yaar kahkar asaram aise baat karte hai jaise uuparavaala unka langotiya ho
 They say that we rain the water of man here, not only that, he further says that wherever there is a drought, we rain water
 abhimaan ne asaram ko andhaa bana diya he
 Otherwise they would have known that the claim of the power to make rain is nothing but four hundred B

 When the idea of supply of double fortified nuts was in progress, some people expressed apprehension about its effect on the color of lentils and vegetables
 lekin us samay bataaya gaya tha ki iskaa gambhir asar nahin hoga
 In fact, Saryu Rai has also expressed apprehension that salt-supplying institutions are also different
 sambhaavna he ki unke dwaara fortification kii prakriya karne main bhi bhinnata ho

 Along with this the noise of slogans also arise, 'look, look who came, the lion of Gujarat came
 ’ 24 varshiya hardik kii reliyon main unhen sunne ke liye patidaaron (patel) ke alaava duusare samudaay ke log bhi pahunchate hai
 Hardik also breaks the image of his Patidar leader and makes him promise to fight unitedly with all the community members
 wo ye jataana nahin bhoolatey ki anyaay sabhi ke saath ho rahaa he
 They also question how development can be insane, there is no development in Gujarat

 Here the representatives of the Bhai community welcomed Hardik with a traditional turban and a gleaming sword in his hand
 raily main hardik ne pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah samet bijepi netaaon par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He also administered an oath to the people present in the rally that whatever be their community or religion, but they will all unite and fight BJP for the development of Gujarat
 ‘aaj tak’ ne raily main aae logon se jaananaa chaha ki hardik main aakhir aisa kya he jisane unhen itnaa lokapriy bana diya he
 Even for him, the term Gujarati dikra (son) was used instead of Patidar leader
 hardik ko sunne aae vasudev singh gohil kshatriya samaaj se hai
 He says, 'hardik has been accepted as a youth leader
 ab sabko pataa chal gaya he ki hardik kaa andolan kisi samudaay vishesh ke liye nahin balki sabhi samudaayon ke liye he, wo sab ke liye lard rahaa he
 Vijay Prajapati, who came to the rally, says, 'hardik speaks the truth, so everyone likes him
 hardik sirf patidaaron kaa nahin ham sab kaa netaa he
 The people of the Brahmin community who came to the rally said that Hardik is raising the right issues, the fact that jobs are going away and demonetisation has worsened the situation
 hardik ko sunne jo log aa rahe hai wo voton main tabdeel honge yaa nahin, kahana mushkil hai
 But it is decided that anyone likes or dislikes Hardik but he cannot be ignored

 kai dashakon tak jis takanic se bharat ko dur rakhe jane kii koshishen hoti raheen, aaj desh ke vaigyanikon ne usee behad jatil takanic main maharath hasil kar lee he, or bhartiya antariksh anusandhan santhaan (isro) ne mahatvapurn uplabdhi ke rup main desh ke sabase taqatvar cryogenic ingine kaa 800 second tak safal pareekshan kar liya
 Through this cryogenic engine, ISRO will be able to launch its next generation rocket geo-synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III (GSLV - Mark III), which is capable of carrying satellites weighing up to eight tonnes
 so, aaj ke safal purnavadhi parikshan (full duration test) ke baad isro ko bharosa he ki vah ab varsh 2016 main nirdhaarit kii gai jieselvi - mark III kii pehali purna udaan kii taiyaariyon main jute saktaa he
 Actually, cryogenic engine technology was not given to India for many years under US pressure, and it took Indian scientists 20 years to master this complex technology, which uses liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen
 tippaniyan On December 18 last year, India successfully tested the mock-up of gslv-mark III without a cryogenic engine, including testing the crew module
 bharat philhal apane jieselvi - mark II rocketon main cryogenic ingine ke chote swaroop kaa istemaal karata he
 It is believed that GSLV will be the rocket through which India will be able to fulfill its decades-old dream, when India sends its astronauts from their earth to space through their own rockets
 is cryogenic ingine ke jariye isro apane agali peedi ke rocket jeeyo-sincronas satellite launch whical mark III (jieselvi - mark III) kaa prakshepan kar sakegaa, jo aath ton vazan tak ke upgrahon ko antariksh main le jane main sakasham he
 So, after today's successful full duration test, ISRO is confident that it can now make preparations for the first full flight of gslv-mark III scheduled in 2016
 darasal, america ke dabaav main bahut saalon tak bharat ko cryogenic ingine kii takanic nahin di gai, or bhartiya vaigyanikon ko is jatil takanic main maharath hasil karne main 20 saal kaa samay lag gaya, jisamen taral nitrogen tathaa taral oxigen kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The comments pichley saal 18 disambar ko bharat ne jieselvi - mark III ke mock-ap kaa bina cryogenic ingine ke safal pareekshan kiya tha, jisamen kru-modul kaa pareekshan bhi shaamil tha
 India currently uses a smaller version of the cryogenic engine in its gslv-mark II rockets
 mana ja rahaa he ki jab bharat apni dharti se apane estronauton ko apane hi rocketon ke jariye antariksh kii ore ravaanaa karegaa, tab jieselvi hi vah rocket hoga, jiske jariye bharat apana dashakon purana sapana puraa kar paaegaa

 haalanki nai kaaron kii bikri bhi notebandi ke chapet main he lekin puraani kaaron kaa market to jaise thap pad chukaa he

 This is the strength of the second-hand car market in the country

 Old Baradari, the Defense Colony site of New Delhi, is the largest second-hand car market in the city
 yahaan ek saamaanya car vikreta 10 dinon main lagbhag 100 car bechata tha
 But since demonetisation, his business has come to a complete standstill
 beete 17 dinon se jari notebandi ke dauraan ek bade dealer kaa kahana he ki usne sirf vahi car bechney main safalataa pai he jiske finance kii prakriya notebandi lagu hone se pehle kii ja chuki thi
 At the same time, the trading through cash has completely stopped
 dilli main hi raajpura road ke bade second hand car dealer ise karmarket kii sabase badi mandibataa rahe hai
 The car dealer has said on condition of anonymity that he used to sell cars in the second-hand market only for cash
 lekin notebandi ke baad 17 dinon ke dauraan uski cell main 90 fisadi se adhik giravat darj hui he
 Of the cars sold in this, five per cent are those cars that the customers had completed before the demonetisation of the preparations to buy through the bank
 shahar ke jin car bazaaron main kharidaar kii bheed lagi rahati thi aaj notebandi ke asar se sannata pasra he

 General elections are being held in Israel for the second time in 6 months, Benjamin Netanyahu is eyeing a record fifth time, it is not possible for a party to form a government on its own, General elections are being held in Israel on Tuesday, on the day of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 69th birthday
 People are using their franchise through general election to choose their new Prime Minister
 israel main 6 maheene ke andar duusari baar aam chunaav ho rahe hai
 The voting is taking place after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government after the election in April
 benjamin netanyahu agar is baar phir jeet hasil kar lete hai to wo record paanchavin baar pradhanmantri banenge
 Former military chief Benny Gantz faces a major challenge in front of Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads the right-wing Likud party
 gantj ne isroyal ke purv vitt mantri or tivi personality yair lapid ke saath centrist blue and white gathbandhan kaa netritv kiya
 Netanyahu's Likud party captured 36 of the 120 seats in the general election held on April 9, the second chance to form a government in 6 months
 jo benny gantj kii blue and white party se ek adhik thi
 Netanyahu got the mandate to form the government, but the coalition government did not last long and he dissolved the parliament in May
 ab aaj ho rahe chunaav main partiyon ke saamne sarkaar banane kaa doosraa mauka rahegaa
 According to an Israeli political analyst, this time too nothing is going to change
 mana ja rahaa he ki nattejey april main hue chunaav kii tarah hi honge
 Israeli local media conducted 2 poll surveys two weeks ago
 iske mutabik, likud party ko 32 seat mil rahi hai jo blue or white se sirf ek zyada he
 In Israel, no single party has ever succeeded in forming a government on its own
 yahaan par gathbandhan kii sarkaar bananaa aam baat he
 The president of Israel is usually invited by the leader of the party with the most seats to form the new government
 agar koi netaa 61 siten hasil karne ke liye partiyon ko ek saath laane main asafal rahata he to aise main raashtrapati kisi or mauka dete hai
 Because of this, the leader of the party who won the election is not necessarily the same Prime Minister
 building ke baahar binaravahin isroyal ke chunaav par bharat kii bhi najar he
 The Narendra Modi government at the Center would have wished Benjamin Netanyahu to become PM again because there would be no need to build relationships afresh if Netanyahu becomes PM again
 donon sheersh netaaon (piem modi or benjamin netanyahu) kii dosti jagajaahir he
 The relationship between the two countries is very good
 donon deshon ke haalia varshon main aarthik, sainya, samrik sambandh bahut oonche str par pahunch gaye hai
 PM Narendra Modi had a historic victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, when Benjamin Netanyahu was the first among the global leaders to congratulate him
 is bich kuch samay pehle isroyal main aam chunaavon ke bich ek binar bhi khub viral hua
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu were seen together in the giant banner
 isroyal ke patrkaar amichai sten ne is binar kii tasviir post kii thi
 This banner was placed outside a building

 This was the reason Narendra Modi reached power and the Prime Minister's chair in 2014
 saath hi bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah ke saath unki dosti ek kaamyaab jodi main tabdeel hui
 But when the same self-confidence starts to take the form of airs, then he can stand on the path of decline
 agle aam chunaav se paanch maheene pehle uttar bharat ke teen rajyon main bhaajapa kii haar main iske sanket dekhe ja sakate hai
 Of course, given the anti-incumbency sentiments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan in particular, the party's performance was more or less right but in Chhattisgarh, it was badly licked, while Raman Singh gave a permanent government here for the first time since its formation in 2000
 was
 ab sirf itnaa hi nahin ki vipaksh ko satta kii gandh mil gai he balki bhaajapa ke bheetar bhi sugabugahaten shuru ho gai hai
 Many leaders have been openly or otherwise saying that if the same style of leadership is maintained, where will it leave the party after five months
 yahaan tak ki is jodi ke samarthakon kaa bhi kahana he ki naukarshahi or kuch chuninda partijanon par modi-shah kii atirikt nirbharta ne unhen jamini sachaaiyon se katkar rakh diya he
 Keep in mind that Modi was once known for finding the truth based on information gathered through his parallel sources
 shah ke ''patibaddh samarthakon'' ke amale main bhi, lagata he, unke saamne sach ko sach kah paane kaa kalejaa he
 It is a situation of 'as the patient pleases, the doctor who tells'
 isi sabake chalate in donon kaa un logon se sampark cat gaya he, jo party or rajg ke sahyogiyon ke bich ahmiyat rakhte hai
 modi-shah's negative campaign against Congress, whether mocking Rahul Gandhi as 'pappu' or slogans like 'congress-mukt Bharat', is now losing its sheen and acceptance
 sangh ke sutron kaa kahana he ki zyada vinamr taur-tareeke logon tak achche rajkaaj kaa sandesh kahin behatar dhang se pahunchaayenge
 After the recent assembly elections, in view of the strong wind in favor of the grand alliance of opposition parties, victory for Narendra Modi and BJP in 2019 is no longer easy
 is bare main sawaal uth rahe hai ki agar bahujan samaaj party pramukh mayawati or samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne haath mila liye to yah jodi uttar pradesh ko lekar kya yukti apnayegi
 If the BJP is to return to power, it is necessary to win this state because 80 mps of the Lok Sabha are elected from here alone
 or agar mahagathbandhan ban gaya to bhaajapa ko 2014 main modi lahar main mili voton se bhi zyada vot hasil karne padenge
 And such discussions have already begun that in the event of BJP getting less than 240 seats, the NDA constituents can pressure anyone other than Modi to make him the party's prime ministerial candidate
 in sabake baavjood yah to kahana hi padegaa ki modi-shah kii fauladi jodi badi karsaaj he
 After the same pair, since coming to power in 2014, helped BJP win in 13 states and formed party government in four other states
 or vidhansabha chunaavon kii taaja paraajay ke baavjood bhaajapa ko keel-kaante durust karne ke liye paanch maheene kaa samay mil gaya he
 And one thing that still goes in favor of Narendra Modi is his reputation for his personal honesty
 pradhanmantri ko ab bhi karke dikhaane vaala mana jaataa he
 He has made adequate arrangements for better implementation of Ujjwala, Saubhagya, Jan Dhan, Awas Yojana (rural and urban), Mudra and other such schemes launched by his government
 in yojanaon kaa laabh 90 fisadi logon tak pahunchane ke sarkaar ke daawey ko agar ham na maane to bhi iskaa phayda to hua he
 And the credit goes to the digital monitoring system created by Modi and Shah to monitor these schemes
 iske alaava ek team ke taur par modi or shah kii jodi abhi bhi utani hi kargar he
 Shah still plays a complementary role, not only managing the party's electoral strategy but also playing an important role in many government initiatives
 ab ayushmaan bharat swasthya beemaa yojana ko hi len
 The progress report of the scheme reaches both him and Modi
 swaabhaavik he ki disambar main teen rajyon ke chunaavon main mili haar ke baad is jodi kaa manobal thodaa gir gaya ho lekin modi-shah ke karishme kii kaat nikaal paanaa abhi itani jaldi sambhav nahin dikhataa
 The Election Defeat in the Three States of the Hindi Strip Just Before the Lok Sabha Elections, Amit Shah's electoral machinery boasted but despite these electoral defeats, the pair have the trust of BJP workers who see him as an honest and hardworking leader
 Overbearing and arrogant working style, too much dependence on bureaucrats, anti-congress campaign was severely criticized
 Naon successful implementation of enhanced Modi's image as a leader to work

 And whatever happened after that brought Pakistani cricket into disrepute
 sarfaraj navaj ne us over main lagaataar chaar bounsar phenke, lekin ampire ne unamem se ek ko bhi wide nahin diya
 Pakistan's plan was to throw the ball so far away from the eye-catching Gaikwad that he could not hit, and the Pakistani umpire was with him in this scheme

 Earlier on Tuesday, it was reported that Pakistan was going to release Sarabjit Singh but later the President's spokesperson clarified that the officials are working towards the release of Surjit Singh
 bhartiya videshmantri eses krishna ne sarbajit ko chode jane kii khabaron par raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ko dhanyavad bhi de diya tha
 Krishna today welcomed Pak's decision to release Surjeet but requested afresh for Sarabjit's release
 krishna ne kaha, ‘‘maine pakistan kii jail se surajeet singh kii jaldi hi rihaai kii khabaren dekhi hai
 i welcome the verdict and freshly request the President of Pakistan to release Sarabjit Singh, who has been in jail for more than two decades
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘jaisaa ki aapako pataa he ki bharat sarkaar ne kai maukon par baar-baar pakistan kii sarkaar se sarbajit singh ke maamle main sahanubhutipurna or maanviya rukh akhriyaar karne ko kaha he
 '' krishna ne kaha, ‘‘main pakistan kii sarkaar se un sabhi bhartiya nagarikon ko bhi reeha karne kii apil karata hum jinhone apni kaid kii sajaa puri kar lee he
 i request the release of all Indians serving imprisonment in Pakistani jails
 ’’ pakistani channelon ne kal kaaphi der tak sarbajit kii rihaai se judi khabaren chalaai thim lekin baad main aadhi raat ko achaanak raashtrapati ke pravaktaa farhatulla babar ne kaha ki is tarah ke kisi faisle se raashtrapati kaa koi sambandh nahin he
 He said, "I believe there is some confusion
 pehali baat yah he ki yah maafee dene kaa maamla nahin he
 The most important thing is that this person is not Sarabjit Singh, but Surjit Singh Baldiyat Sucha Singh
 uski sajaa ko 1989 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri benazir bhutto kii salaah par raashtrapati gulam ishak khan ne tabdeel kiya tha
 According to Babar, Law Minister Farooq Naik had informed the Ministry of Home Affairs that Surjit Singh had completed his life sentence and was to be released and sent to India
 babar ne kaha, ‘‘ab use (surajeet singh) kisi bhi tarah se jail main rakhana gaiyr kanoonee hoga
 He said that any reference to President Zardari in this matter would have to be talked out of context
 tippaniyan Surjit Singh is currently lodged in Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore
 vah beete 30 saal se pakistan main kaid he
 He was arrested on charges of espionage from near the Indian border during the time of military ruler General Ziaul Haq
 sarbajit (49) bhi lahore sthit kot lakhapat jail main band he
 He was sentenced to death in 1990 for his involvement in the blast in Punjab province and has been in Pakistani prison for the last two decades
 mangalvaar ko pehle yah khabar ai thi ki pakistan sarbajit singh ko reeha karne ja rahaa he lekin baad main raashtrapati ke pravaktaa ne safai di ki adhikari surajeet singh kii rihaai kii disha main kaam kar rahe hai
 Indian Foreign Minister SS Krishna also thanked President Asif Ali Zardari on the news of Sarabjit's release
 krishna ne aaj surajeet ko reeha kiye jane ke paak ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya lekin sarbajit kii rihaai ke liye nae sire se anurodh kiya
 Krishna said, "I have seen the news of Surjit Singh's early release from Pakistan jail
 main faisle kaa swaagat karata hum or sarbajit singh ko reeha karne ke liye pakistan ke raashtrapati se nae sire se anurodh karata hum, jo do dashak se adhik samay se jail main band he
 "he said," As you know, the Government of India has repeatedly asked the Government of Pakistan to take a sympathetic and humane stand on Sarabjit Singh's case
 ’’ Krishna said, "I also appeal to the government of Pakistan to release all Indian citizens who have completed their prison sentence
" main pakistani jelon main kaid kii sajaa kaat rahe sabhi bharatiyon kii rihaai kaa anurodh karata hum
 Pakistani channels yesterday ran the news of Sarabjit's release for a long time, but later in the middle of the night suddenly, Presidential spokesman Farhatullah Babar said that the President had no connection with any such decision
 unhone kaha, ‘‘meraa maananaa he ki kuch bhram he
 The first thing is that it is not a matter of granting amnesty
 sabase ahm baat yah ki yah vyakti sarbajit singh nahin, balki surajeet singh baldiyat sucha singh he
 His sentence was commuted in 1989 by President Ghulam Isaac Khan on the advice of the then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
 ’’ babar ke mutabik kanoon mantri faruk nike ne grih mantralay ko isaki soochna di thi ki surajeet singh ne umrakaid kii sajaa puri kar lee he or use reeha karke bharat bheja janaa he
 Babar said, "now it will be illegal to keep him (surjit Singh) in jail in any way
" ’’ unhone kaha ki is maamle main raashtrapati jaradaari kaa koi hawala dena prasang se hatakar baat karnaa hoga
 The comments surajeet singh philhal lahore kii kot lakhapat jail main band he
 He has been imprisoned in Pakistan for the past 30 years
 use sainya shaasha general jiyaul haq ke samay bharat kii seemaa ke nikat se jasusi ke aarope main pakadaa gaya tha

 andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang kar rahi telugu desham party (TDP) kii centre sarkaar se naaraazgi khulkar saamne aa gai he
 The two ministers from the TDP quota in the Modi cabinet may resign on Thursday
 haalanki, tidipi pramukh chandrababu naidu is masale par guuruuvaar subah pradhanmantri narendra modi se baat karenge
 It is being told that Naidu will give final orders to his ministers only after talking to the PM
 yani pradhanmantri se naidu kii baat hone ke baad hi donon mantri istipha de sakate hai
 Earlier, Andhra Pradesh CM and TDP top leader Chandrababu Naidu held a press conference late on Wednesday, saying that injustice had been done to his state
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ne andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada nahin nibhaayaa he
 Due to which we have decided to separate from the central government
 nayud ne ye bhi kaha ki wo satta ke bhukhe nahin hai
 Let us know that tdp's Ashok Gajapathi Raju and YS Chaudhary are included in the Modi cabinet
 aglaa kadam NDA gathbandhan par hogachandrababu naidu ne saaf kiya ki abhi unhone maang puri na hone par pehle kadam ke rup main kendriya mantrimandal se alag hone kaa faisla kiya he
 After this, the next step will be taken on staying in NDA
 unhone kaha ki ab is baat par nirnay liya jayega ki endie main rahanaa he yaa nahin
 Naidu said that i had told the government very politely
 pichley chaar saal se hamane bahut mehnat kii he or sabhi vikalpon par kaam kiya he
 Even in this afternoon's speech, i did not say anything
 maine sirf rajya ke saath anyaay kii baat kahi
 The PM could not be spoken to, who also said that he wanted to inform this decision to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but he could not be contacted
 cabinet meeting main hue the shamilhalanki tidipi ke donon mantriyon ne buudhvaar ko sansad main hui cabinet kii meeting main hissaa liya tha
 Earlier, on Tuesday there was also a meeting of the TDP Legislative Party in Amravati, in which most of the mlas talked about breaking the alliance with BJP
 baithak main party ke 125 vidhayakon ne hissaa liya tha
 What is tdp's displeasure? TDP says that the central government has failed to fulfill the assurances given in Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main piem ne andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 The party says that an alliance with the BJP was done so that justice could be done with Andhra Pradesh, but it did not happen
 party kii ore se kaha gaya he ki andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri naidu 29 baar dilli gaye, pradhanmantri or kendriya mantriyon se mili, rajya se jude maamalon par kai baar anurodh kiya, lekin kuch nahin hua
 Andhra Pradesh was divided in an unscientific manner, facing many difficulties today
 party ke mutabik centre sarkaar andhra pradesh ke logon kii bhaawanaaon ko nahin samaj rahi he
 For four years, the people of the state had been hoping for justice with them
 haal hi main pesh hue endie sarkaar ke aakhri purna bajet main bhi andhra pradesh ko fund nahin diya gaya
 Attempts to convince did not work, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in a press conference on Wednesday evening that Andhra Pradesh will be given special package not special state status
 unhone kaha tha ki andhra pradesh ko special states ke aadhaar par hi special package diya jayega
 Read this: The special category that Andhra Pradesh is demanding, what are the benefits of it, the central government was not ready
 Even though the government is not ready to give special status to Andhra Pradesh, but it indicated that the development of Andhra Pradesh Apart from providing financial assistance for the project, the metro rail project for Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam is also ready to be approved
 tidipi kii maang thi ki modi sarkaar us vaade ko puraa kare jo andhra pradesh ke vibhaajan ke dauraan tatkaaleen sarkaar ne kiya tha
 The government cannot demand tdp's demand for special state status to Andhra Pradesh because rules have to be changed to grant special state status to any state
 agar niyamon main badlaav karke tidipi kii maang ko maan liya to bihar, jharkhand jaise anya rajya bhi is tarah kii maang kar modi sarkaar kii mushkilen badha sakate hai
 Therefore, the Modi government is not ready to bow down to the TDP demand at any cost

 a day later, Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who is going to enter the 48th spring of his life, has made a tweet on the ongoing sit-in demonstrations from both the power and the opposition in Delhi, which attacked both sides, but did not say that he himself With whom dilli main is samay garmi ke saath-sathraajnneetik sargarmibhi kaaphi tej he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and 3 of his ministers have been sitting on a dharna in the LG house for the last 8 days, in response to which the main opposition party of the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is staging a sit-in at the CM House
 8wein din khud rahul ne todi chuppipichley 8 dinon se rajdhani dilli main rajya sarkaar or uparajyapal ke bich jari tanatani khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi, lekin apratyaashit taur par desh ke 2 sheersh netaaon pradhanmantri narendra modi aurcongress adhyaksh rahul gandhiki ore se is par chuppi bani hui thi
 Though many other parties have reacted to this, after the Shiv Sena, now the Janata Dal United (JDU), the ally in the ruling NDA at the center, has openly supported Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 jediu pravaktaa kasee tyagine kaha, 'ham na dharne ke paksh main hai or na hi dharne kaa virodh karne waalon ke saath
 However, Kejriwal's demand for the grant of full statehood to Delhi and PM Modi's intervention in the matter are of course supported
 'isse pehle, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or trinmul congress kii pramukh mamata banerjee ne bhi kaha tha ki is maamle par congress ko apana paksh rakhana chahie
 Mamta Banerjee supported Arvind Kejriwal in this case

 The special thing about his tweet is that he has also said his words and does not appear to take any side
 unhone bijepi or aap se baraabar kii duuri banane kii koshish bhi kii
 Delhi CM, sitting in Dharna at LG office

 PM turns a blind eye to the anarchy; rather nudges chaos & disorder
 People of Delhi are the victims, as this drama plays out

 He tweeted through tweet that the bureaucrats are busy in the press conference

 Like Rahul, before the evening of June 18, he has kept silence on this episode
 rahul ne kaha ki rajya main arajak sthiti ban rahi he or pradhanmantri ne is par ankhen moond rakhi hai
 In the end, he called the entire episode a drama and said that the drama is going on and the people of Delhi are hurt by it
 rahul kii tarah congress ne bhi is masale par apni sthiti saaf nahin kii he
 Rahul told the public about the dharna-demonstration through tweet and also blamed the state and central government for this
 aapako bataa den ki dilli congress ke netaa chaahe ajay maakan hon yaa shila dikshit, aam aadmi party se haath milaane ke mood main najar nahin aate
 However, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal and Congress President Rahul Gandhi appeared on the same platform on the occasion of the formation of a joint government of Congress and JDS in Karnataka and the swearing in of CM HD Kumaraswamy
 kisaan sanghathan kshetreey vyapak aarthik bhagidaari (aarasieepi, riginal comprihensive iconomic partnership) kaa virodh lagaataar kar rahe hai
 These organizations say that this trade agreement will prove to be ruinous to the farmers and people living their livelihood from farming
 is samjhaute se deyari udyog to buree tarah barbaad ho jayega
 Swadeshi Jagran Manch said, the government will have to take a knee, Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a subsidiary of the National self-service Association (RSS), is also continuously opposing it
 manch ke rashtriya pravaktaa deepak sharma ne bataaya, 10 aktubar se 20 aktubar ke bich sanghathan desh virdohi or kisaan virdohi is samjhaute ko badhate kadamon ko rokane ke liye kisi bhi had tak jayega
 Demonstrations against the government, effigy burning, frequent meetings, district collectors to mps and ministers will be met
 unhen bharosa he ki manch sarkaar ko ghutane techne ke liye majaboor kar degaa
 Farmers' organizations, also a national spokesman of the National Farmers Federation, Abhimanyu said that on October 10, in Delhi, a meeting will be held with the representatives of farmers from all over the country and will prepare the strategy
 kisaan pravaktaa abhinyu ne bataaya ki vipaksh main rahete hue aarasieepi kaa virodh karne vaali bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar bina kisi kii sune is samjhaute kii taraf aage bad rahi he
 Actually, twenty-eight meetings have been held between 16 countries of the world so far
 november ke pehle saptaah main is samjhaute ko antim rup die jane kii ummid he
 First here, understand what is RCEP? It is a business partnership between some countries
 isamen das asian sadsy desh (bruneii, cambodia, indonesia, laos, myama, philipino, singapore, thailand or vietnam) ke alaava austrailia, china, bharat, japan, dakshin korea or newjiland shaamil hai
 There is a free trade agreement between them
 agar yah samjhauta ho jaataa he to in deshon ke bich bina vyapaar ke liye aayaat shulk shunya ho jayega
 So the question arises that what is the problem for the farmers? In fact, farmers say that if the products from other countries are imported at zero duty then who will buy the products being produced in abundance within the country
 hamaare desh main doodh kii paryaapt maatra he
 What do the farmers say? Senior leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union Yudhveer Singh said that if this agreement is fully implemented, then the country will suffer a loss of 60 thousand crores revenue
 aaarasiipi 92 pratishat vyapaarik vastuon par shulk hataane ke liye bharat ko baadhya karegaa
 India has suffered a loss of about 26 thousand crores in 2018-19 by approving cheap imports with ASEAN block countries
 bharat aaarasiipi ke tahat vyapaar karne vaali vastuon par shulk ko 92% se gata kar 80% karne ke liye dawaab bana rahaa he
 But India will not be able to increase duty later
 yah ek aisa praavdhaan he, jisase bharat ko apane kisaanon or unki aajeevika ke sangrakshan khaasi dikkat hogi
 Now countries like New Zealand and Australia are ahead of India in milk production
 bhale hi newjiland yah kah rahaa ho ki vah bharat ko keval 5 fisadi hi doodh or deyari utpaada niryaat karege lekin ye 5 pratishat hi hamaare puure bazaar ke ek tihaai ke baraabar hai
 Now if the country which is leading in milk production like Australia will also export dairy products in our country, then what will be the condition of our country? India is self dependent country in dairy
 aise main, ham un chizon kaa aayaat kyon karen, jinka utpaadan bharat main bahut kam yaa hota hi nahin he
 Apart from dairy, RCEP will also exempt foreign companies in important sectors such as seeds and patents
 isse japan or dakshin korea se aane vaale bijon, dawaaiyon, or krishi rasayanon kaa prabhutv bharat hi kyon duniyabar main failega
 However, according to experts, this step of the government can prove effective in dealing with the economic slowdown in the country
 iske alaava desh ke kai utpaadon ko baahar bazaar milane se unki behatar keemten bhi milengi
 *** kaam main laaparvaahee baratane ke aarope main jharkhand sarkaar ne medininagar jile ke jila vikaas ayukta or jila yojana adhikari kii tankhwaah roak di he

 ) Cricket fans will be watching their favorite star cricketers during the 'cricket Mahakumbh' ICC World Cup 2011, starting from Thursday, while the trophy for which all the stars will meet each other is no less than a superstar
 
 
 
 vijeta chaahe jo bhi rahe, lekin antim palon main photographer sabase adhik tasviren isi trophy kii lene vaale hai
 
 
 Not only this, this trophy will be held till late night on 2 April and in the morning of 3 April, along with the winning team on all television channels, newspapers and web portals of the country and the world
 
 
 11 kilogram vajani or 60 centimetre oonchi is trophy ke liye guuruuvaar se 14 tiimon ke bich 43 dinon tak ab lagaataar jang chalegi
 
 
 The one who achieves this will be called the king of world cricket for the next four years and the winning captain will look forward to seeing it
 
 
 aaie, jaanate hai, aakhir kisi he yah trophy or kya he iskaa itihaas
 
 
 The trophy was given an official name in the 1999 World Cup, the ICC World Cup trophy
 
 
 isse pehle use prudential cap, benson and hejez cap, wills trophy or reliance cap ke naam se janaa gaya
 
 
 It was a period when the sponsorship of the sponsors was in vogue with the World Cup, but after 1999, the ICC added its name forever
 
 
 varsh 1975 main jab pehali baar vishwacap khelaa gaya tha, england kii jivan beemaa company prudential corp ne ise pryojit karne kaa faisla kiya tha, or uski shart thi ki cap ke saath uskaa naam joda jaae, so, isisi ne vahi kiya
 
 
 Subsequently, during the 1979 and 1983 World Cups, the trophy was also known as Prudential Cup
 
 
 isi kaaran shuruaati teenon vishwacap england main hi khele gaye
 
 
 India won the World Cup in 1983 and thus this cup came to India for the first time
 
 
 varsh 1987 main vishwacap pehali baar england se baahar khelaa gaya, or iskaa aayojan tatkaaleen champiyanon kii dharti bharat main kiya gaya, pakistan sah-aayojak tha
 The main sponsor of this World Cup was Reliance Industries, So, World Cup Trophy or World Cup known as Reliance Cup
 
 
 reliance aaj bhi vishwacap kaa aadhikarik praayojak he, lekin ab trophy ke saath uskaa naam nahin judaa he
 
 
 The World Cup was then played in 1992 in Australia and New Zealand, sponsored by Benson & Hedges, a cigarette manufacturing company, and this is why the World Cup was known as the Benson & Hedges Cup
 
 
 australia kii saiyr karne or nae naam se jane jane ke baad vishwacap trophy ek baar phir nae naam se mashhoor hone ke liye taiyaar thi
 
 
 In 1996, the World Cup was again held in India and this time it was sponsored by cigarette maker itc's biggest brand, Wills, so the trophy was known as Wills Cup
 
 
 sthaan or naam badalte-badalte trophy maano thak gai thi, so, usne naam main sthayitv kii guhaar lagaai, jise isisi ne suna or 1999 main england, wales, ireland, nederland or scotland kii sanyukt mezbaani main khele gaye vishwacap ke aathven sanskaran se is trophy ko isisi vishwacap trophy naam de diya gaya
 
 
 Now the interesting fact was that the ICC had given the trophy a new name, but it did not really have any trophy to give to the winning team
 
 
 prudential cap (1975, 1979 or 1983) ke baad jitne bhi vishwacap khele gaye, trophiyaan hameshaa ke liye vijeta tiimon ko de di gayi, lekin isisi aane vaale samay main aisa nahin karne vaala tha
 
 
 Keeping this in mind, he decided to create an attractive trophy that should have been made of gold and silver and that is why the ICC entrusted this important work to the famous jeweler of London, Gerrard & Co
, named to the world crown jewelers Knew from 
 
 jeweler ne do maheene main 60 centimetre or 11 kilogram vajani ek khaas tarah kii trophy taiyaar kii, jisamen sone or chaandi kaa prayog kiya gaya
 a gold-plated globe has been made in it, which is surrounded by stumps and bells (wickets and gills) on three sides
 
 
 globe gend kaa parichaayak he or stamps or bels cricket ke teen vibhaagon - gendbaaji, ballebaaji or kshetrarakshan - ke parichaayak hai
 
 
 The names of the former winners are etched on the trophy and most importantly, the original trophy is kept at the ICC headquarters located in the UAE city of Dubai
 
 
 vishwacap jeetne vaali tiimon ko isisi champiens trophy kii pratikruti di jaati he
 
 
 Many fans of cricket may not know that the teams that win the World Cup are given a replica, not the original trophy, but in spite of this, there is no lack of excitement in the players regarding the trophy
 
 
 ab sachai yah he ki cricket vishwacap kaa yah mahakumbh fifa footbal vishwacap ke baad vishwa main sarvaadhik dekha jane vaala khel aayojan bana hua he or jis trophy ke liye yah mahakumbh hota he, uski haisiyat kisi superstar se kam nahin

 On behalf of the Supreme Court-appointed ML Sharma Committee, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said on Tuesday that the preliminary inquiry found Sinha guilty of influencing the coal scam case
 supreme court main rohtagi ne bataaya ki cameti kii report ke mutabik,ranjit sinha ke gharaki visitor diary main maujuud entry sahi lag rahi hai
 The committee believes that it is evident from the entries in the register that Ranjit Sinha met some accused

 'register also required to be checked' Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi also presented the central government's side in the court
 unhone ne kaha ki agar in mulakaaton ko sahi maan bhi liya jaae to iskaa ghotaale kii jaanch par galat asar padaa, ye sabit nahin hota he
 Whether the register is real or not has not been confirmed yet as there has been no investigation
 'sinha ke khilaaf saboot naakaafi'rohtagi ne aage kaha ki is maamle main cameti ke jutaaye saboot naakaafi hai or aapraadhik mukadmaa darj karne laayak nahin hai
 Apart from this, whatever decisions Ranjit Sinha took were taken under the supervision of the Chief Vigilance Commission
 atorni general ne yah bhi kaha kii sarkaar ko koi aapatti nahin hogi, agar ye report sabhi pakshon ko di jaae
 'SIT should be investigated in the case' On the other hand, Prashant Bhushan, counsel for the petitioner Common Cause, told the court, "when prima facie it seems that Ranjit Sinha has tried to influence the investigation, then the case should be filed against Ranjit Sinha immediately
 diary sahi he or jo mulaakaaten huin usase sinha ke faisle prabhavit hue, isliye is maamle kii vistaar se esaiti jaanch honi chahie
 'bhushan further said that it becomes extremely important to check whether the bribe has been transacted? Does Sinha's assets exceed the income? There is no way that the veracity of the report can be tested
 'sivisi kii nigaraanee main hota he sabakuch'ranjit sinha kii taraf se pesh ho rahe varisht vakil vikaas singh ne kaha ki sibiai main jo bhi faisla liya jaataa he wo dastavejon par aadhaarit hota he

 On the other hand, there is an era of Rahul's honor in the Congress

 On Monday too, Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled states met Rahul Gandhi under the leadership of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot
 maan-manouvval kaa daur 2 ghante tak chalata rahaa
 Gehlot and Kamal Nath themselves even offered to resign as Chief Minister, but Rahul did not agree
 mulaakaat ke baad gahalot ne rahul ke istipha waapas lene kii ummid jataate hue kaha ki unhone hamaari baaten dhyaan se sunin
 Gehlot was claiming to have sent the feelings of the activists to Rahul Gandhi, but the question is whether the feelings of the workers had not been reaching till Rahul Gandhi? Had also tried to convince by meeting
 kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat ke dauraan rahul ne apana dard jaahir kiya tha
 According to the news, Rahul had said that i am sad that despite such a huge defeat of the party, none of the chief ministers of the party resigned
 madhya pradesh main 1 seat par simati congress, rajasthan main hua safayarahul gandhi ne kisi ek mukhyamantri kaa naam nahin liya tha, lekin raajnneeti ke jaankaar ise sidhe-sidhe ashok gahalot or kamalnath se hi jod rahe hai

 Rahul was hopeful that the party would do better in both the states with the reins of government in experienced hands, but this did not happen

 At the same time, Jyotiraditya Scindia, who was considered close to Rahul and played an important role in the state assembly elections, also lost only one seat in Madhya Pradesh
 party ke is pradarshan ke baad rahul ko donon netaaon se yah ummid thi ki vah isaki jimmedaari lete hue istipha dekar ek udhaaharan prastut karenge, lekin aisa hua nahin
 When asked about the resignation of Kamal Nath, who reached India Today's program Mind Rocks, in response, he clearly said that Lok Sabha elections are not fought on the issues of the state
 ashok gahalot, kamalnath se isliye bhi naaraaz hai rahulrahul gandhi ne chunaav ke dauraan apane beton or parijanon ko tikat dilaae jane par bhi naaraazgi jataai thi
 Rahul had also said that in the election, the leaders remained focused on just one seat
 gahalot or kamalnath ne bhi apane putron ko tikat dilaae the
 The only Chhindwara parliamentary seat came from the party's seat in Madhya Pradesh, where Kamal Nath's son Nakulnath was the candidate
 anya sabhi 28 siten party haar gai
 At the same time, Ashok Gehlot's son also contested
 haalanki vah haar gaye
 This is also a reason for Rahul's displeasure

 Shahrukh Khan and Deepika Padukone's film 'happy New Year' continues at the box office
 relies ke pehle din hi 'kik' or 'dhooma' jaisi blockbster filmon kaa record todane ke baad 'happy new year' ne shanivaar ko 35 karod se zyada kii kamai kii he
 Bollywood news websites have claimed this
 'happy new year' main sarprise, shahrukh ke saath unka betaa abramin websiton ne daawa kiya he ki film ne lagbhag 38 karod rupee kii kamai kii
 Let me tell you that the film did a business of about 45 crores on Friday

 The entire star cast has made a tremendous promotion for the film
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki yah multi starer film koun-koun se record todatii he
 There have been such indications in many past political events that perhaps this time Prime Minister Narendra Modi should bring Amit Shah in his team running the government
 isamen rajyasabha saansad hote hue gandhinagar se amit shah kaa chunaav ladanaa sabase bada sanket tha, jis gandhinagar se bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani 6 baar saansad rahe hai
 Amit Shah made his debut in Parliament in August 2017 as a Rajya Sabha MP
 is baar gandhinagar se unhone apana pehla loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha
 He won the election in Gandhinagar by a record 5 lakh 57 thousand votes
 unhone jeet ke antar ke maamle main laalkrishna adwani kaa record todaa
 He is one of the 12 mps who have won by a margin of 5 lakhs
 amit shah ne gandhinagar ke jariye ek tarah se laalkrishna adwani kii siyaasi viraasat sambhaal lee
 It was also a big indication that the BJP has now moved ahead of its older generation leaders
 amit shah ke paas pichley 5 saal se bijepi kii kaman he
 He is 54 years old and the question is whether Amit Shah will now take responsibility in the Narendra Modi government or will he still prefer to remain the party president
 kyonki bijepi ke niyamon ke mutabik ek adhyaksh 3 saal ke do kaarykaal puure kar saktaa he
 Amit Shah is yet to have a second full term as BJP President
 janvari 2019 main 3 saal kaa unka pehla purna kaarykaal puraa hua tha, lekin unhen chunaav tak asthaayee adhyaksh ke taur par jimmedaari di gai thi
 If he continues as BJP President, he will have a term till 2022
 agar vah mantri banenge to phir kisi or ko adhyaksh ke taur par chunaav karnaa padegaa
 This happened in 2014, when Rajnath Singh became the Home Minister and left the post of President, then his remaining 2-year term was completed by Amit Shah
 54 saal ke amit shah agle chunaav tak 59 saal ke ho jaaenge
 In such a situation it is possible that he should be given responsibility in the cabinet

 madhya pradesh ke ek bijepi vidhayak ne 'kathin sawaal' poochne vaale ek patrkaar par barasate hue saarvajanik rup se kaha ki vah 'encounter' kaa aadesh de sakate hai
 Representative of Sardarpur Assembly seat, Vel Singh Bhuria, was attending a farmers' function in a village on Tuesday, and it is reported that he was agitated when the people present there started questioning him

 After this statement, the Congress went to the police and showed a video clip of Vel Singh Bhuria, who became MLA for the first time and demanded his arrest
 bataaya gaya he ki police ne aashwaasan diya he ki vah dekhegi ki kya kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state has not given any formal response to the matter, but the party's district president Ramesh Dhariwal dismissed the allegation saying, "he (vel Singh Bhuria) is innocent and straightforward

 One such case has surfaced at Ithar's college in Dinajpur district of West Bengal
 pariksha ke dauraan trinmul congress (tiemasi) ke ek netaa kii patni ko nakal karte hue pakad liya gaya to party ke kathith kaaryakartaaon ne college kii principal or anya shikshakon ke saath marpet kar di
 Meghnad Saha College Principal Swapan Mukherjee said that the inspectors caught a woman cheating during the BA First Year examination
 mukherjee ne mahila kii ansarshit or nakal kii parchi jabt kar lee or kamare se chali gayi
 The woman who was caught cheating is the wife of Trinamool Congress leader Gautam Pal
 sutron ne bataaya ki ghatana ke kuch hi der baad bahari logon ke ek samooh ne pahunchakar mahila kii copy lautaane ke liye dabaav banaaya
 They were all Trinamool activists
 principal kaa aarope he ki jab unki maang nahin maani gai to unhone mukherjee or do anya shikshakon par hamalaa kar diya
 These included a female teacher
 mukherjee ne kaha ki likhit shikaayat taiyaar karke jaldi daakhil kii jaaegi
 The incident took place on the day when Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asked members of the party's student unit not to take the law into her own hands

 On the other hand, something else was going on in Rahul's mind
 apane parivaar ke garh amethi main ve pichad rahe the, haalanki baad main ve bijepi netaa or narendra modi kii ‘‘choti bahan’’ smriti irani se 1,07,903 voton se jeetne main safal rahe
 It is clear that the avenues are closing for this Congress prince
 party kii jholii main jab maatr 44 siten hi ain to party netaaon ne turant unka bachaav karnaa shuru kar diya
 The Congress had earlier won the lowest 114 seats in 1999
 nivartmaan sansadeey kaary rajyamantri rajeev shukla kehete hai, ‘‘hamen itani kam siton kii ummid nahin thi
 "but at the same time he immediately added," This is not a defeat of Rahul Gandhi
 yah party kii samuhik jimmedaari he
 After that in the afternoon when Rahul Gandhi came out of the Congress headquarters with his mother to take responsibility for his defeat in the election, he remained disconnected, distant and mechanically from the whole process
 maano ab tak kii congress kii sabase badi paraajay abhi tak sweekrut nahin ho pai he
 The biggest question before Congress and Rahul Gandhi is the principle and presentation
 2009 main party garibi ko kam karne main safal rahi thi, lekin jaise iske saath-saath mahangaai ne bhi aasmaan chuaa to ummiido par grahan lag gaya or modi kii nitiyon ke prati ek ummid jaagi
 Dalit thinker Chandrabhan Prasad says, "even the poorest of the poor don't care about bread
 ve behatar jindagi chaahate hai or isi sawaal par modi kaa sikaa chal gaya
 On every front, Rahul was behind Modi
 jahaan ek ore modi ne khud ko ek garib aadmi ke rup main prastut kiya, jo apane kapade khud dhota tha or jisane plateform par chaay bechi
 At the same time, Rahul could not come out of the image of his rich fortunate dynasty
 modi ne nae udhyami bharat main naukari or sansaadhan dene kaa vaayada kiya, jahaan pratibha kaa sammaan kiya jayega
 At the same time, Rahul's promise was to distribute donations and rights under an arrangement
 aisi vyavastha, jo maai-baap samskruti ko badhaava detii he
 While Modi's campaign was very well-planned and planned, where each region was carefully selected and tried to reach people on a large scale, Rahul's campaign was disorganized
 aakhirkaar congress kaa bharat aam aadmi party kii tarah jansabha kaa koi model prathit ho rahaa tha
 It is obvious how Arvind Kejriwal's party has breached the Congress votes in Delhi and Punjab
 congress acchhee tarah jaanati he ki haar kii jimmedaari rahul gandhi ke kandhon par he
 Rahul, a 43-year-old Congress vice-president, spent most of his time in the ninth row in the 15th Lok Sabha, where he used to talk to South Mumbai MP Milind Deora or let Dhorhara MP Jitin Prasad peep into his cellphone
 is tarah ke drishy kabhi-kabhaar hi nahin the, khaskar yah dekhte hue ki loksabhaa main unki maujuudagi mahaj 43 fisadi thi, jisamen ve sirf do baar hi bole
 The so-called future leaders of the country, known for having risen up in the middle of the conversation, have always avoided taking responsibility
 party jab bhi unki aguai main chunaav haari, unhen tarakkee de di gai
 Whether the 2012 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh or the December 2013 assembly elections, where the Congress lost in four important states
 ab tak kii unki 10 saal kii raajnneeti main congress satta main thi
 But now that feature is over for Rahul
 congress ke log unase kuch kar dikhaane kii ummid kar rahe hai
 Rahul's behavior and his attitude in the opposition will determine the fate of the Congress itself
 centre for study of develping societes (siesds) main professor sanjay kumaar kehete hai, ‘‘sabase pehali cheez rahul ko yah samajni hogi ki raajnneeti purnakalik or choubison ghante kaa kaam he
 According to this, it is not a time to disappear and disappear, in which you can go abroad to spend the holidays without telling anyone, whenever you want
 ’’ 14 may ko manmohan singh ke vidaai ratribhoj main rahul kii gairmaujuudagi ne raajnneeti main unki gambhirtha ke bare main sawaal khadey kar die
 Rahul had gone out of the country on 12 May and returned on 15 May
 congress ke netaaon ke liye unka bachaav karnaa kathin ho gaya tha, kyonki unhen rahul kii yatra ke bare main koi jaankaree nahin thi
 In the past, Rahul Gandhi has always run away from taking responsibility or taking any role in governance
 2009 main jab manmohan singh ne unhen sammanpurvak cabinet main mantri pad dene kii peshkash kii thi to unhone yah kahkar use lene se inkaar kar diya tha ki unhen party ke liye kaam karnaa he
 His image sometimes became an insurgent and an outsider listening to the conscience, but his image as a leader was not made
 ab rahul ke paas chunauti sweekaar karne ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 "they need to do something that the Gandhi family has not been able to do for a long time," says a senior Congress leader
 unhen ek nayaa naaraa gande kii jarurat he, jo nichle tabake kaa dhyaan rakhane ke saath nae bharat ko lubhaa sake
 "promote local leadership
 Rahul's first task should be to try to bring democracy to the party seriously
" is bare main ve baaten to bahut karte hai, lekin ab tak yah kaam sirf yuva congress tak hi simit rahaa he
 "the biggest problem of our party is that everything is decided from Delhi," says a Congress leader

 That is why they are successful

 The Congress has tried to eliminate regional power centers in a systematic way

 Last year, Rahul tried to empower some regional leaders, but half-hearted attempts were too late
 sachin payalat, arun yadav or ashok tanvar ko rajasthan, madhya pradesh or haryana kaa pradesh adhyaksh tab banaaya gaya jab 2013 main party vidhansabha chunaav haar gai
 "the problem is still that Pilot and Yadav are not big leaders," says a Rajasthan Congress leader
 janata main unki apil waisi nahin he, jaisi ki unke pitaaon kii thi
 "build rapport with senior leaders
 It is imperative for Rahul to do another job immediately to end the internal infighting within the party
" mohan gopal, jairam ramesh or madhusudan mistre ko rahul kaa mukhya ranneetikaar banaae jane se kai varisht netaaon jaise chidambaram, digvijay singh or ahamed patel main naaraazgi he, jinhen rahul ke nae karibiyon kaa aadesh maananaa pasand nahin he
 Apart from this, some leaders like Kamal Nath, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tiwari and Satyavrat Chaturvedi are finding themselves redundant or redundant in the party
 chaar baar saansad rah chuke ek netaa kehete hai, ‘‘jab rajeev netaa the to mujhase kaha jaataa tha ki main abhi bahut yuva hum or mujhe intjaar karnaa chahie
 And now i am considered old in Rahul's team
 main nahin jaanata ki meraa samay kab aayega
 "A Congress leader says," Rahul should try to connect the old leaders
 ’’parivaar kii kahanicongress adhyaksh 67 varshiya sonia gandhi ab apni jimmedaari rahul par chhodia chaahati hai, lekin rahul use sweekaar karne se hichakate rahe hai

 Even though the party and its allies have governments in 13 states, if it loses in two states, then only two major states will remain in Karnataka and Kerala
 party ko arvind kejariwal kii ‘‘aap’’ party ke prati bhi sachet rahanaa hoga, kyonki vah safaltaapurvak uske voton main send laga rahi he
 There is no possibility of any major dissolution in front of the party, as the party had to face after the defeat in 1996
 us samay sharad pavaar or mamata banerjee ne party chhodkar apni party bana lee thi
 The Gandhi family is still the life stream of the Congress
 lekin 2014 kii haar dikhaati he ki desh par party kii pakad kamjor ho rahi he
 Will Rahul be able to make changes within himself to make his party stand again in time? We have to wait for 2019 to see this

 This was a warning and advice of US President Barack Obama on his way out of India
 america chahta he ki bharat zyada se zyada saaf suthri bijli kaa istemaal kare
 Nuclear power plants, solar panels, hydro power and wind energy towers are the ways in which electricity can be produced without circulating carbon in the air, but if Obama is saying this then there are reasons behind it
 bharat-america parmaanu qaraar ke saath-saath hui duusari sandhiyon ke tahat america se bharat ko agle kuch saalon main das hazaar megawatt ke riyector kharidne hai
 Experts are saying that the interests of companies like General Electric and Westinghouse have also been a big issue in Obama's visit
 varisht patrkaar siddharth varadarajan kehete hai, 'america main newclear energy kaa bade str par istemaal hota he, lekin pichley kuch vakt se iskaa vistaar tham sa gaya he
 Attempts are being made to set up nuclear energy plants in many states, but many issues such as local protests and radioactive waste management are being hampered
 isliye pichley 30-35 saalon se vahaan badi companiyon ke riyector nahin bik rahe
 ' obama ne saura urja kii baat bhi kahi, lekin sawaal yah he k agar america bharat ke saath saura urja par sahyog karegaa to kya vah america companiyon ke banaae solar panel kharidne par hi dabaav nahin daalega
 Right now China is making solar panels at a much cheaper price
 bharat khud bhi chahta he ki vah apane desh ke bheetar inkaa nirmaan shuru kare, lekin ashanka he ki america ke man mutabik baat na maanane par vah bharat ko dablutio kii sandhiyon ke tahat mushkil main daal saktaa he
 Obama's visit and his speech on the last day at the Sirifort Auditorium have raised many questions
 obama ne kaha ki america ke carbon imishan pichley 20 saal main sabase nichle str par hai
 It is true that America has reduced carbon emissions, but the US has done nothing special for it
 paryaavaran or jalwaayu parivartan ke muddon ko kareeb se cover karne vaale patrkaar nitin sethi carbon imishan kam karne ke america ke daawey ko haasyaaspad bataate hai
 Sethi says, "america's emissions reached such a high level in 2005 that they had to come down after that
 america ab bhi yahi kah rahaa he ki vah agle pandrah saalon main apane carbon imishan par keval 26 se 28 pratishat kii katautee karegaa jo jalwaayu parivartan ke khatare ko dekhte hue kaaphi choti koshish he
 ' sach yah he ki paryaavaran main aaj tak jamaa kiye gaye carbon par nazar daalen ko america kaa hissaa sabase adhik he
 That is, America has soiled the earth and sky the most
 america duusare viksit deshon or china ke saath milakar paryaavaran main failane vaale carbon spes par qabza kiye hue he
 In such a situation, when developing countries grow and carbon will be released, will the US not oppose it
 jalwaayu parivartan par salanaa sammelan is saal ke ant main paris main ho rahaa he
 Developing countries are seeking clean energy technology and money support from rich countries to compensate for their environmental degradation
 sach yah he ki america ne technology dene se to saaf manaa kar diya he or ab vah paise kii madad kii baat se bhi peeche hat gaya he
 The rich countries had talked about creating a hundred billion dollar green fund, neither the money is being deposited in it nor the poor and developing countries are getting help
 ulte america ne kah diya he ki antarrashtriya bainkon se milane vaala karz or garibi mitaane ke liye di ja rahi madad bhi isi fund kaa hissaa maani jaayegi
 Developing countries are very angry about this
 haal main lima main hue paryaavaran ke sammelan main in muddon par tanatani saaf dikhaai di
 In such a situation Obama may have given anything, but the seriousness of his country in the production of clean electricity in India will continue to be questioned
