 Although people like Akshay Kumar's film very much, but recently the actor has made a disclosure about his film career
 isamen unhone bataaya ki bollywood ke bade diarectors unhen apni filmon main cast nahin karte hai, is vajah se vah aksar nae diarectors ke saath hi kaam karte hai
 Talking to the media during the trailer launch of 'good News', Akshay Kumar revealed this

 If you do not get work in a large institution then you have to go with the small
 vahaan se aap chalaang laga sakate hai
 You can't just sit at home and wonder why people are not taking you to the movies even after being so capable
 "trailor launch ke jab khilaadi kumaar se poocha gaya ki kya aisa samay tha jab bade diarectors keval khans ke saath hi filmein banane main lage the
 Replying to this, Akshay said, "they go to those who deserve this

 " Team India were defeated by Zimbabwe by 10 runs in the final T-20 match of the series
 ye pehla mauka tha jab zimbabwe ne kisi tii-20 match main bharat ko patkhni di
 The reason for the defeat was the batsmen, who could not even achieve the target of 146
 darasal is puure daure main bhartiya ballebaazi main kii kami nazar ai he
 In the series of 3 odis, India did not touch the figure of 300 even once, while in the series of 3 odis, India's highest score was 276 runs
 do T-20 match kii series main bhi 200 kaa aankada team india nahin laga pai or T-20 main team india kaa sarvocch score rahaa 178 ranon kaa
 Even after this average performance, captain Ajinkya Rahane is not ready to believe that there is a lack of enthusiasm among the players
 aginky kaa kahana he "khilaadiyon main josh kii kami nahin thi, puure daure par jis tareeke kii cricket hamane kheli usase main santusht hum
 But yes, the defeat in the last T20 has definitely disappointed us

 Except bowling Sandeep Sharma, all the bowlers performed well
 haalaaki rahane is pradarshan ke liye apni kamazori se zyada virdohi kii takat ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 According to Rahane "we should give credit to Zimbabwe for playing good cricket
" puri series main wo acha khele hai
 We lost 4 wickets very early in the last T20 due to which we lost
 gendbaazon ne acha kaam kiya magar ballebaaz aakhri match main chook gaye
 "the bench strength or the young team, whatever it is named, could not do anything that could be celebrated
 
 This is a warning for the selectors, now they have to think ahead of these reserve players so that future Team India can be better prepared
 is ausat pradarshan ke baad bhi captain aginky rahane ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin ki khilaadiyon main josh kii kami dikhi
 Ajinkay says "there was no lack of enthusiasm among the players, i am satisfied with the way we played cricket on the whole tour
 lekin haa, aakhri tii-20 main mili haar ne hamen thodaa niraash zarur kiya he
 "the batsmen's personal performance also does not set high expectations

 The ongoing rhetoric between the US and North Korea is not calling for a halt
 ab america raashtrapati donald trump ke bayaan se tilamilaae uttar korea ne unako maut kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 North Korea's state media has also sharply criticized Donald Trump for insulting dictator Kim Jong-un
 uttar korea ke sarkari akhbaar rhodong sinmun ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa ki america raashtrapati donald trump faansee dene ke laayak hai
 The newspaper said that Donald Trump has committed a major crime by hurting the honor of North Korea's Supreme Leader Qin Jong Un, for which he cannot be forgiven
 trump ko yah pataa hona chahie ki is bhayankar aparaadh ke liye sirf maut kii sajaa he
 It may be known that last week Donald Trump traveled to South Korea during his tour of five Asian countries

 In addition, Donald Trump has called North Korea's Supreme Leader a madman, but this time angry with the statement of the US President, the North Korean government newspaper said in its editorial that Donald Trump has committed a big crime by insulting the Supreme Leader of North Korea
 , For which they cannot be forgiven
 is aparaadh ke liye unako sirf faansee kii sajaa di jaani chahie

 Defending US President Donald Trump's decision to remove FBI Chief James Comey, the White House has said that Trump had been planning to sack him since day one since he lost confidence in him

 He said, 'this has put many personnel, superiors, mps and citizens of the department into concern
 ’unhone yah baat sweekaar kii ki trump ne dipti atorni general se baat kii thi
 With reference to the letter which formed the basis for removing Komi, he said, "the President said that he should give these concerns and suggestions in writing
" ’patr milane ke turant baad trump ne komi ko bakhrast kar diya tha
 White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters at a press conference yesterday, 'the President had lost confidence in Director Komi
 jis din komi ko chunaa gaya tha usee din se vah unhen hataane par vichaar kar rahe the
 'trump told reporters that Komi was not doing his job properly

 After this, Trump is the only Republican contender left

 During a conversation with the media in Columbus, Cassich however did not give any specific reason for ending his campaign
 kasich ne sirf ohio main hue primary chunaav main jeet hasil kii thi
 Cassich has decided to withdraw the claim, exactly one day after Ted Crude withdrew the claim
 isse pehle texas ke ted krooj ne bhi raashtrapati chunaavon ke liye apni daavedaari waapas lene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Cassich, who was an MP for the past 18 years and a two-time governor of Ohio, had lost the trump in the primary elections
 haalanki isse pehle kasich khud ko republican party kaa sabase prabal daavedaar or hillari clinton kaa majboot vipakshi bataate the
 But with the New Hampshire primary election held in February, Cassich was facing defeat
 kasich ne ohio main apane samarthakon se kaha, 'main apni muhim yaheen roak rahaa hum, mere man main phir se yah vishwaas, gaharaa vishwaas he ki ishwar mujhe aage kii raah dikhayega or mere jivan ke makasad ko puraa karegaa
 Of the 16 contenders to withdraw from the race to become the Republican nominee, Cassich has finally withdrawn
 kasich kii raashtrapati pad kii muhim kuch khaas nahin rahi
 He has so far had the support of around 150 delegates in primary elections and caucuses held in 40 states

 She wrote in a letter to the PM that while demonetisation can be done overnight, then why does the Prime Minister not take strict steps to protect women overnight? Maliwal said that if the PM is using his and the police's energy to break their fast, half of the energy is spent in the interest of women, then the country will improve

 Finally, after a lot of controversy, now Alia Bhatt's film 'udta Punjab' is ready to be released, here are some excerpts from a special conversation with Alia: Your look in 'udta Punjab' movie reminds me of your movie 'highway' ? This film is not like 'highway', but yes Chaka is far from Chaundha's life
 kaaphi alag tarah kaa kirdaar or film he
 Do you think that the issue of these drugs is limited to Punjab only? It is not that drugs are a problem not only of Punjab but of the whole country and the world
 'bihar kii migrant' kaa kirdaar nibhaana kitna mushkil tha?maine kuch documentries dekhi jisaki vajah se main ek 'drug abyuj' ladki kaa kirdaar samaj sakuun
 i had also prepared for the character by going to the outskirts of Punjab, after going to a house, i asked them what they want, after all, they want less than life, but they work hard
 is kirdaar ke liye khaas tarah kii bhashaa kii taiyaari bhi aapane kii?ji haa, mujhe'pankaj treepathi'ji ne 'bihar' kii bhashaa bolni sikhaai
 He is a theater actor, so he taught me this language very easily
 kya aapane asal jindagi main kisi drug edict se mulaakaat kii he?aajkal parties main log aksar bathroom main jaakar drugs lete hai, main isse inkaar nahin karti, lekin koi aisa nahin he jisase meri mulaakaat hui ho
 Have you ever tried drugs? No, not at all, i am from a fighter's family, at one time my dad (mahesh Bhatt) used to be intoxicated, but he has not touched alcohol for the last 27 years
 , This is why we have got such inspiration since childhood
 papa ke kitne kareeb hai aap?mere papa ek aise aadmi hai jo ek bachche se bhi baat karte hai to ek edlt kii hi tarah karte hai
 So it was difficult to relate in childhood
 hamaare paas kuch zyada baat karne ko nahin hota he, lekin ab main conect kar paati hum, or hamaara rishta kaaphi strong he
 Is your film called Dark? There is entertainment factor along with Dark, Tommy Singh's character is very entertaining
 gharavaalon ne film dekhi?haa dekhi, mummy to rone lagi kyonki unhen laga kii is kirdaar ke saath ab kuch bura hone vaala he, gharavaale kaaphi shock or sarpraij hue
 Did the censor object in the beginning? The censor has a process of its own which i do not know much about, but it is an important story that everyone should see, it is not only the issue of Punjab but the whole country, the issue of drugs People die due to this, it is necessary to caution people

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again topped the 'time Person of the Year' survey
 bich main kuch dinon ke liye ferguson ke pradarshnkaree unase aage nikal gaye the

 Ferguson's demonstrators are second with 1 percent
 hongcong main loktantr ke samarthan main pradarshan karne vaale joshua vong 7
 Pakistan's teen activist Malala Yusufzai is 5, with 5 percent votes
 2 pratishat mat ke saath chauthe sthaan par hai
 The weekly news magazine said, 'indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has overtaken the' Time Person of the Year 'survey, beating the Ferguson protesters
 matdaan ko sirf chaar din bache hai
 The magazine had said that Modi had 10 by Tuesday
 8 pratishat vot mili the jabaki ferguson ke pradarshnakariyon ko 10
 Got 2 percent votes
 modi kii badhat kal majboot hokar 12
 Peaked at 8 percent
 ibola kaa ilaaj kar rahe doctoron or nurson ne 4
 Has secured the fifth position with 5 percent of the vote and has overtaken Russian President Vladimir Putin
 putin ko 4

 vaarshik surveykshan ke liye matdaan chah disambar ko samaapt hoga or vijeta kii ghoshnaa aath disambar ko hogi
 The Times editor will select the 'time Person of the Year' and will announce it on 10 December
 times 1927 se hi ‘person of da year’ ke chayan ko lekar is tarah ke surveykshan kaa aayojan kar rahaa he
 Laxmi Sehgal 1914-2012 a civil libertarian fighter, public doctor, champion of women's rights and communist revolutionary Laxmi Sehgal died at the age of 98 on 23 July
 kanpur ke us barish vaale din kanpur medical college ke lon main unhen vidaa karne ai bheed ke saamne captain lakshmi sahagal kii putriyon subhashini or anisa ne chikitsiya gyaan ko aage badhaane ke liye unki deh college ko daan kar unki antim ichha puri kii
 The principal of the college expressed his deep gratitude for this, calling it an unprecedented donation
 jajbaati maahaul main hui antyeshti main bhaag lene vaale kuch logon ke dimag main yah ek sawaal tha ki is asaadhaaran mahila ko shradhanjali dene ke liye kendriya yaa rajya sarkaar kaa koi pratinidhi kyon upasthit nahin he
 But Lakshmi herself would have just shrugged her shoulders over this indecent behavior of the Delhi court
 bharat kii antim mahaan mahila swatantraaa senaanee sangrakshan or aatmadhanyata kii raajnneeti kii kathor virdohi thim, jiske bare main unka maananaa tha ki swatantra bharat main raajnneeti kii yah style satta kii pahchaan ban chuki thi
 It can be said that his distance from these entities and his happiness and sorrows from the people of India, his everyday struggles, was reflected in his last journey — the absence of the first and the heavy presence of the second
 un aitihaasik ghatnaon main, jab unhone netaji kii jhansi kii rani regiment kaa netritv kiya or ve british fouj se ladiin, apni bhoomika ko lekar unamem kisi vyaktigat mahatvakanksha kaa nitant abhaav or nidhaal kar dene vaali vinamrata unki sabase asaadhaaran visheshtaon main ek thi
 This reflects another fundamental election made by him and his decision to spend his life in the service of the poor
 yah kisi bhi tarah se 'daan' par aadhaarit drushtikon nahin tha
 It was a very political way of looking at the world
 unka is baat par gaharaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak shoshan or garibi kii jindagi se bharat ke nirdhanon ko mukt nahin kara liya jaataa or desh ko chalaane main unki bhi nahin suni jaati, tab tak bharat kii swatantraaa kii raksha nahin kii ja sakati
 She joined the Marxist Communist Party in the '70s and was the founding leader of the All India Democratic Women's Association
 ve trade unionon main bhi sakriy thim
 It is also a parable of the freedom to decide indoors that her husband Prem Sehgal, who was her fellow fighter and a national hero at the INA, as well as an accused in the 1947 Kuyat Lalkila case, was managing the mill
 There was a part outside which his wife Lakshmi and daughter Subhashini used to picket a red flag in their hands
 kanpur kii apni saadhaaran-si clinics se kabhi kisi ko unhone lautaaya nahin, ve daantatin, puchkaaratin, salaah deteen or is prakriya main apane se bade stri-purushon se bhi mummy kaa upnaam paaya
 Here he devoted himself to the treatment of the poor
 vastav main unhone apane sampark main aane vaale logon kii jindagi se andhvishwaason or bematlab ke rivaajon ko khatm karne ke liye sangharsh karne vaale ek samaaj sudhaarak kii bhoomika nibhaai
 She had a strong belief in family planning to protect the health of women and we often laughed when she repeated in front of us her favorite jugs she used in her speeches for 'irresponsible men'
 
 ve jati vyavastha se nafrat karti thim or uske khilaaf unka bolnaa khaasaa aveshpurna hota tha
 She always encouraged inter-caste marriages and was always ready to join them
 beyimaani yaa kharaab raajnneeti se saamana hone par unke paas shabdon kii kabhi kami nahin padati thi
 It has a sensational example of how when a leader of an outright communal political party wanted to touch his feet at a memorial meeting in Bombay, he dragged his feet back and said no
 pehle jaakar apane haathon se khun ponchkar aaie
 In the 1992 presidential election, she was a candidate of the Left and some pro-party parties
 jab ve haar gayi to yah unka nuksaan nahin tha
 India was at a loss, having missed the opportunity to get such a stupendous woman, an inspiring human being, a theorist and a virtuous person as her first citizen
 unki jindagi nyaay ke liye bhartiya janata ke sangharsh kaa hissaa he
 She will always be immortal
 brunda karaat rajyasabha main makapa kii saansad hai The Supreme Court has asked the Central and State Governments to reduce the number of red light vehicles so that the common people can freely take to the road
 ek maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki aajkal laal batti kii gaadi juthi shaan dikhaane kaa jariya ban gai he
 The Supreme Court has asked the governments to change the law in this regard and said that this is their last chance
 ek maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne kaha ki aajkal laal batti kii gaadi juthi shaan dikhaane kaa jariya ban gai he

 karnataka main bijepi ke bies yediurppa bahumat ke jaadui aankade se 7 siten kam hone ke baavjood 104 vidhayakon ke dam par mukhyamantri bane
 But he had to leave his chair only after 55 hours of taking the oath
 congress-jedies ke vidhayakon ko bijepi ne apane kheme main laane kii koshish kii, lekin unhen kamyaabi nahin mil saki
 The biggest obstacle in his path was the 'dal Balaam Prohibition Act' made during the time of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, due to which Yeddyurappa was forced to resign
 bataa den ki bies yediurppa ko apni satta ko bachaae rakhane ke liye 111 vidhayakon kii jarurat thi
 While there were 104 mlas from BJP
 aise main 7 anya vidhayakon kii unhen darkaar thi
 For this, if the 7 mlas from Congress and JDS had broken their ties, their membership would be canceled under the Anti-defection Act
 ye tabhi ho saktaa tha jab aadhe se zyada vidhayak party se naata todakar aate, tab unki sadsyta barkaraar rahati
 This work was impossible for BJP
 'dal badal nishedh kanoon' laane kaa shrey purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko jaataa he
 Between 1967 and 1983, the game of defection was fiercely played
 congress se samaajawaadee netaaon ne jahaan naata tod alag hue, to vahiin congress ne kai rajyon main iskaa jamkar phayda uthaaya or apni sarkaar banaai
 Haryana became a new state in 1966, separate from Punjab
 ek saal baad 1967 main chunaav hue
 Of the 81 seats in the state, Congress was elected 48, Jana Sangh 12 and 16 mlas Independents
 iske alaava swatantra party ke 3 or republican army of india ke 2 vidhayak jeet kar aae
 The Congress was assigned the chair of CM post to Bhagwati Dayal Sharma, but soon split within the party
 dakshini haryana ke raav birender singh ne congress main baghawat kar di
 He broke away from the party with 37 Congress mlas
 swatantra party, jansangh kaa samarthan or 16 nirdaleey vidhayakon se milakar sarkaar banaai
 And this is where the game of defection started
 aath maheene chali is vidhansabha main 44 vidhayakon ne apni vafadari badali
 One member changed the party five times, two members four times
 teen vidhayakon ne teen baar, chaar vidhayakon ne do baar or 34 vidhayakon ne 1 baar apana khemaa badla
 Gaya Lal, who became MLA from Hasanpur seat of Palwal in 1967, changed the party thrice in 9 hours
 haryana kii raajnneeti main satta banaae rakhane ke liye iskaa khub istemaal hua

 purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ne 197 saansadon ke saath 1969 main congress ko todakar alag party bana lee thi
 Due to this controversy, Indira Gandhi introduced the Legislative Amendment Bill in 1973
 isi ke do saal baad apatkaal laga diya gaya
 In the 1980s, the trend of party-change increased so much that Parliament had to add the 10th Schedule to the Constitution through the '52nd Constitution Amendment Act'
 haalanki dal-badal kaa zyaadaatar phayda congress ne uthaaya
 After the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the Congress contested the Lok Sabha elections in December 1984, with its new-born leader Rajiv Gandhi
 unhone chunaav main dal-badal kanoon laane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Within 8 weeks of the Congress coming to power, the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi passed the anti-defection law in Parliament from both the houses in 1985 to end the disease of defection

 Maharashtra has not seen such a massive protest of Dalits since January 1992
 us vakt marathavada uniwarsity kaa naam dow
 There was such a vigorous demonstration demanding the name of Ambedkar
 prakaash ambedkar ne disambar main gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main jad(you) ke baagi netaa chotubhai vasava (baad main unhone bhartiya tribal party, yani bitipie bana lee) ke samarthan main samudaay ko golband kiya
 He then raised the issue of Dalits joining the Koregaon Bhima on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the fight between the Peshwa and the British Army as a 'brave race'
 yah thik vahiin dohraane kaa jatan tha, jo baba sahib ne 1927 main isi din kiya tha
 Ambedkar says that he wants a dialogue between many Dalit factions
 ve kehete hai, ''ise dobaaraa shuru karne ke liye hamen itihaas main peeche lautnaa hoga
 Ambedkar, a lawyer in the Charity Commissioner's Court, believes that his campaign has been successful so far
 ab ve dalit aakrosh ko siyasat or talim kii taraf modia chaahate hai
 About 11 per cent of the Dalit population in Maharashtra together with eight per cent of the tribal population can form a strong pressure group
 magar daliton ke chaar mukhya samooh—mahaar, chamaar, maatang or dhor—puraane samay se hi buree tarah bante hue hai
 Ambedkar hopes to change this
 ve sweekaar karte hai ki ve 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye kaa mansuba bana rahe hai, magar yah bhi kehete hai ki saamaajik punarotthana siyaasi satta se kahin zyada ahm he
 They insist that the games of political power can prove to hurt the real purpose and the real purpose is to bring social change
 ve kehete hai, ''mayawati ne dikhaa diya he ki siyaasi satta samaaj ko nahin badal sakati
 "they say that reservation does not bring development with them and that is why they are in talks with many ngos to carry forward the agenda of 'education for all'
" ve kehete hai, ''chaatro ke paas shiksha kaa vikalp hona chahie
 This will be our agenda
 agar unamem kuch vanchit hai, tab aarakshan ke bare main sochen
 "they claim that other (dalit) leaders will support them
" unka kahana he ki yuva peedi jati kii golbandi main bharosa nahin karti
 He says, "A decade ago they came together on the question of making primary education compulsory
 ''ambedkar ko congress kii kshamta par bharosa nahin he ki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa muqabla kar paaegi or isliye ve vamapanthiyon kii aguai vaale morche kii vakaalat karte hai
 "left parties can match Modi's non-corrupt image," he says
 '' unhone koregaanv bhima main vampanthi kaaryakartaaon or chaatr kaaryakartaaon kii giraftaar kaa joardaar virodh kiya tha
 However, many of his own people raise doubts about his inclination towards the Left
 unke ek kattar samarthak naresh jadhav maanate hai ki ''bhaajapa ke khilaaf congress hi hamaari swaabhaavik sahyogi ho sakati he
 Ambedkar does not agree with this
 ve kehete hai, ''vam dal aage aa jaaen to bhaajapa vahaan hogi jahaan aaj congress he
 "they also say that there is room for all political ideologies in India's democracy

 For the last two weeks in Kashmir, apart from large cases and speculations, events and references have dominated
 hamaare liye ise samajhnaa jaruri he taaki parmaanu shaktisampann dakshin asia par latakate khatre kii gambhirtha ko samajha ja sake
 The latest incident is the death of three Kashmiri youths
 ye teenon noujvaan suraksha balon ke haathon maare gaye
 The conditions created by it were so serious that the Jammu and Kashmir government had to register an FIR against a top officer of the Indian Army
 lekin us adhikari ke pita ne is exiar ko supreme court main chunauti de di
 He said that there is no such right
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki maare gaye teen yuvakon—javed bhatta, suhail lone or rais ganai—ke mata-pita ke paas jaanch karaane yaa sajaa dilaane kii to baat hi dur he, apane beton kii maut kaa record rakhane kaa bhi adhikaar nahin he
 There is no possibility of punishment as the state governments have to seek the permission of the central government to prosecute under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA)
 rit yachika main yah duvidha kashmir ke liye bhartiya loktantr main nihit virodhabhas kii vidambnaa ko ujagar karti haih kathith rup se ''janata" kii chuni hui sarkaar janata kaa hi pratinidhitiv nahin kar sakati he
 The immediate reference to this is that on an average 300 ceasefire violations have occurred on the Line of Control (loc) in recent years, not a single citizen of Pakistan has been given a visa in the last six months, military operations, civilians living along the Line of Control Incidents of mutilation, mutilation and death have increased unprecedentedly
 yah pakistan-india piples forum for pis and demokrasi (piipipidi) ke tapan bose ne is maheene kii shuruyaat main bhubaneshwar main 10veen baithak kii taiyaari kii report main bataaya he
 This shows that the government, as a mechanism, ignores that governance is for the public — not just for the region, as the 500-year-old concept of the so-called nation-state tells us
 vaake or sandarbh kaa yah sammilan dakshin asia ko do sabase bade kshetreey or janasankhyikee vaale deshon bharat or pakistan ke bich sambandhon main virodhabhaason or gadabadiyon ko dikhaata he
 This has created a great danger which the world is unable to see, but citizens of both countries are becoming aware of this danger day by day
 phir kashmir main mood kya he? sakht ravaie main badlaav kii ek choti-si lahar bhi nahin dikhaai detii
 People are just showing off the FIR lodged by PDP and they know that for the party, this mind is also mine, Patta is also my bet
 party ek ghatana par logon kii naaraazgi ke avasar kaa laabh uthaanaa chaahati he or duusari taraf gathbandhan kii saajhedaar bhaajapa par jimmaa daal detii he ki vah eexspie jo vastav main marshall lau hi he, ke sandarbh kaa istemaal karke vaastavik karrwai ko beasar kar de
 This unintentional collusion of events and context gives the politically fragile Kashmir an opportunity to understand why the BJP government's attitude at the Center suddenly softened a few months ago when it made a "special representative" for Kashmir
 Had appointed bhaajapa ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar kii vaastavik samasya yah he ki vah gavarnence main apane sahyogiyon ko niyantrit karne main asamarth he
 It is worth noting here that they have a genuine faith in the basis of the electoral jumla, their union and extended family and the supporters of the partners who remained outside the control
 iskaa sanket centre sarkaar kii raksha mantri ke rukh se saaf dekha ja saktaa he jinhone pehle to exiar kaa samarthan kiya or baad main us ''riyaayat" ko badal diya
 Apart from this, another indication is also given by the mood of the speakers on television
 kashmir par bahes karte hue unka yahi kahana hota he ki yuddh kii baat ke sivaa or koi baat nahin
 It is considered a common thing in Kashmir
 kashmir main yah maan lenaa saamaanya baat ho gai he ki unka yah sangharsh us rajya ke saath ladate hue khatm ho jane tak he jo unki berogari, buniyadi dhaanche, arthvyavastha or vikaas ke liye jabaavadeh he
 This should be a matter of greater concern for New Delhi

 It is believed that through this front, there may be an initiative to form government again in the state
 iconomics times kii report ke mutabik pidipi ke baagi vidhayak or purv mantri imran ansaari ne kaha ki rajya main jald hi nayaa raajnneetik morcha saamne aayega
 This front will create emotional blackmail of Kashmiris by politicians and politically free the central government from the game of blackmail
 nae morch ko lekar ansaari ne kaha ki kashmir mudde se jude maamle hi unke bich algaav kaa kaaran bane hai
 This front will raise issues that have not been fulfilled in the state and will work for Jammu and Kashmir

 On the second day of the budget session, there was an uproar in both houses of Parliament over the issue of banking scam
 congress, tiemasi, tidipi, shivasena samet puure vipaksh ne loksabhaa or rajyasabha main neerav modi ke mudde par hangaamaa kiya
 The special thing is that the supporters of the government were also involved in the uproar
 hangaame ke kaaran loksabhaa kii kaarywahi dinabhar ke liye sthagit kar di gai
 Congress wants adjournment: Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said amidst the uproar in Lok Sabha that the government is ready for discussion and notice has also been given in this regard, yet it is not being discussed
 darasal congress samet vipaksh kii maang he ki loksabhaa main neerav modi or banking ghotaale par niyam 52 ke tahat charchaa ho jabaki sarkaar 193 ke tahatcharchaa ke liye taiyaarhe
 Congress leader and former law minister Veerappa Moily said that the Modi government is avoiding discussion on the issue, the opposition wants discussion under the adjournment motion
 haalanki asana kii ore se sthagan prastaav ko manjuur nahin kiya gaya he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar attacked the Congress and said that the Lok Sabha speaker accepted the discussion under 193
 aaj ke list of bijness main isko rakhaa gaya tha
 Banking scams in the last few years will be discussed, Congress does not want to discuss them
 unhone vipakshi netaaon par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki rahul gandhi or mallikarjjan khadge bataaen wo kya chupaana chaahate hai
 Anant Kumar said that the Congress had given notice under 193 itself
 ham sidhaa-sidhaa congress se poochna chaahate hai ki wo kya paap chupaana chaahate hai
 Why does the Congress have trouble discussing the scandals of the past years? sansad ke niyamon ke mutabik niyam 193 main alpakaaleen charchaa hoti he or sambandhit mantri uskaa jawaab detaa he jabaki 52 main bahes ke baad voting kaa praavdhaan he
 Attempting to surround the UPA, in fact, the government wants to discuss the PNB scam as well as bank scams in the past years
 aisi charchaa main sattadhari dal ko vipakshi dal congress ko gherne kaa puraa mauka milegaa
 If the bank scandals of previous years are discussed, the BJP will raise issues like Vijay Mallya in the House, while the Opposition only wants to discuss the issue of Nirav Modi and encircle the government
 bijepi kii ore se purv mantriyon ke bhrashtachar par charchaa ke liye bhi notice diya gaya he
 Discussion on this issue has not yet been approved by Asan
 is mudde par charchaa kar bijepi purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ko nishaanaa bananaa chaahati he, jinke beti karti par INX media cese main mani landring kaa aarope he
 The ruling party and the opposition have different demands
 donon hi dal sadan main khud ko baikfoot par nahin dekhnaa chaahate, yahi vajah he ki niyamon kaa sahaara lekar apni-apni sharton par charchaa ke liye taiyaar hai
 In such a situation, the ruckus continues in both the houses and the second day of the session has also become the victim of this uproar

 Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashish Khaitan alleged, "agriculture minister in Modi government, Radha Mohan Singh has made a proclamation statement that Modi government is now unable to give 50% benefit of their cost as per election promises made to farmers," Because doing so will create a big problem in the open market
 modi ke mantri ke is bayaan kaa matlab he ki desh kaa kisaan ab modi sarkaar se koi ummid naa rakhe, kyonki modi sarkaar ko open market kii companiyon ko hone vaale munaafe kii zyada chintaa he
 If the farmer of the country is committing suicide under the burden of debt, then it does not matter to the Modi government, because this government is not worried about the farmer of the country
 'aam aadmi party ne bijepi ke ghoshnaa patr ko laharaate hue modi sarkaar par sawaal bhi khadey kiye
 Ashish Khaitan said, 'the Bharatiya Janata Party and Narendra Modi had said in their election manifesto that they would work towards improving the condition of the farmers and the farmers would be ensured 50% of their cost
 lekin, is vakt desh kaa kisaan karz naa chukaane or uski fasal kaa sahi mulya naa milane se pareshaan he or kaafii badi sankhya main aatmahatya kar rahaa he
 In such a critical situation, the Modi government has left the farmers of the country to die of hunger
 'haalanki, aam aadmi party kii kisaanon ke liye chintaa raajnneetik jarur nazar aati he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has announced that it will inform the farmers of Punjab about this decision by the Modi government
 punjab ke saath-saatham aadmi party puure desh main kisaanon ke adhikaron ko lekar bade paimaane par ek abhiyaan chalaaegi
 Ashish Khaitan said that the Aam Aadmi Party will fight the farmers' fight from the road to the Parliament and will continuously pressurize the Modi government of the country to either fulfill their electoral promises to the farmers and if they cannot, the Prime Minister will join hands Apologize to the farmer

 ) The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has refused to approve a Gujarati film on the Patel reservation movement
 board ne 'salagto sawaal anamat' ko yah kehete hue pramaan patr dene se inkaar kar diya ki vartmaan swaroop main agar yah film pradarshit hoti he to isse kanoon or vyavastha se judi samasya or bighad sakati he
 The Censor Board also has a problem with the dialogue of the film and believes that the dialogue was constituted by the Constitution of India Dr
 biaar ambedkar ke khilaaf hai
 The film was to be released on 17 June
 kshetreey filmon se jude maamalon ko dekhne vaale sibiefasi karyaalay adheekshak kedy kamble ne kaha, 'film ko pramaan patr dene se inkaar kiya gaya he
 Kamble said, "this has been done because if it is released in its current form, it could worsen the law and order problem, because the film is based on the life of Hardik Patel, the leader of the reservation movement Is in jail and the case is under consideration
 saath hi film main doctor ambedkar or aarakshan niti ke khilaaf samvaad hai
 The manufacturers have now sent their application to the revision committee of CBFC and are now waiting for its approval
 nirdeshak rajesh gohil ne kaha, 'ham logon ko haal hi main sibiefasi kii taraf se jawaab mila he, jisamen usne kaha he ki film hardik patel par aadhaarit he or vah jail main hai or kanoon evam vyavastha se judi hui dikkat ke kaaran unke khilaaf maamla chal rahaa he
 ' unhone saath hi kaha, 'hamaari film hardik patel ke jivan par aadhaarit nahin he
 Our film is based on the Patidar reservation movement, not on Hardik Patel
 ham logon ne yah baat kahi he
 'mobin Khan, who played an important role in the film, said,' It seems that the censor board also has little knowledge of Gujarati language, because it has said that the dialogue spoken in the film is against Baba Saheb Ambedkar, but the matter Is not
 agar thik se suna jaae to sirf ek baar unka zikr he, jab ek paatr kahata he ki ambedkar ne bhartiya samvidhan main aarakshan kii vyavastha kii
 The makers said that they started filming within a month of the start of the Patidar movement at the GMDC ground in Ahmedabad last year and sent it to the censor board for certification two months ago
 tippaniyan The Gujarati film focuses on Deepak Patel, who is shown struggling for his education and job after his father's death

 Kiran Bedi has joined BJP and she will also contest the Delhi Assembly elections, it has been decided, but from where it is not decided and there is also speculation about whether Kiran Bedi can be bjp's CM face in Delhi Huh? And is Kejriwal's answer to Kiran Bedi for BJP in Delhi? dilli ke purv siem arvind kejariwal or bijepi netaa baniin kiran bedi ne apane jivan kaa sabase mahatvapurn andolan ''lokapal andolan'' saath hi kiya or donon hi team anna ke ahm sadsy ke taur par khub mashhoor hue, lekin 2011 main shuru hua lokapal andolan dedh saal baad jab ek saamaajik andolan se ek raajnneetik party kii taraf bad chalaa to kiran bedi ne raajnneeti main aane se inkaar karte hue kejariwal ke saath chalane se manaa kar diya
 See today, even if Kiran Bedi entered politics, she is facing Arvind Kejriwal
 haalanki, kiran bedi kaa bijepi main shaamil hona koi hairat bhari ghatana bilkul nahin he
 Kiran Bedi looked very close to the BJP from the time of Lokpal movement and even when she refused to enter politics with Kejriwal, it was believed that she did not want to harm BJP, so she did not go to politics with Kejriwal
 narendra modi ko piem ummidavaar ke taur par unhone khub saraahaa, lekin saraahte hue ye bhi kahati rahi ki wo arajanatik hi rahengi
 Kiran Bedi's CM candidature had come up for discussion in May 2014, when the BJP won the country, but over time it seemed that the BJP would not bring anyone from outside and make him the CM candidate
 kiran bedi ke bijepi main shaamil hone kii khabar aate hi unke puraane twit bhi charchaa main aa gaye jaise 16 march 2013 kaa unka ye twit ''ek din narendra modi ko gujarat dangon par safaai deni hi padegi baavjood iske ki adaalatein unako ab tak clin chit de rahi hai'' Or his tweet of 5 September 2013, "if political parties do not come under the purview of RTI, two countries should withdraw the tax exemption given to them as well as bungalows and land should be withdrawn"
 narendra modi aaj piem ho chuke hai or bijepi artiai ke daayre main aane se aaj bhi inkaar hi kar rahi he
 Will such thoughts leave the pursuit of Kiran Bedi? isse pehle main aage badhun, main aapako bataa duun ki aaj jab main aam aadmi party ke daftar main gaya to vahaan uske aalaa netaaon se mulaakaat ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki kiran bedi unki chintaa kaa sabab bani hui thim or unke maathe par chintaa kii lakeer khinchi hui thi, lekin poochne par netaa yahi kah rahe the ki 'koi fark nahin padane vaala'
 After this, i went to the office of the Delhi BJP, thinking that there would be a celebration here, but the leaders of Delhi BJP were also disappointed
 bayaan to netaa kuch bhi de rahe the, lekin unke haav-bhav se pataa chal rahaa tha ki kiran bedi unki bhi chintaa kaa sabab hai
 Actually, this concern is the name of the contest, which is being called Kejriwal vs Kiran Bedi
 aap ke log to isliye chintit hai ki wo maanate rahe hai ki kejariwal ko agar koi siem chehre ke taur par takkar de saktaa he to wo hai kiran bedi
 And when Kiran Bedi comes to BJP, her fear seems to be coming true
 aam aadmi party kaa ye dar kitna vaazib he ye aage likhuunga
 The leaders of Delhi BJP are upset because their chance to move forward may have been lost now
 dilli ke andar bijepi ke andar alag-alag gut hai jo kiran bedi ke aane se hi isliye pareshaan hai kyonki wo bahut bada naam hai or unke hote hue dilli kii jimmedaari unako nahin mil sakati
 It is also a matter of fact that the BJP leaders think that they have been out of power in Delhi for 17 years and are struggling and now it seems that they are just going to win Delhi and the power just came into hand If you understand, someone comes out and sits on their head
 khayr dilli bijepi ke netaa kuch bhi sochakar pareshaan hote rahe hon, hoga vahiin jo piem modi or party adhyaksh amit shah chahenge
 Let us now see who looked so heavy in Arvind Kejriwal vs Kiran Bedi (because of which you are worried) Kiran Bedi's image like Arvind Kejriwal is also an honest officer
 arvind kejariwal ne 49 din jis tarah sakhti se shashan karke rishwatakhori kam karne kii koshish kii thik usee tarah kiran bedi ek sakht police afasar ke taur par pahchaan rakhti hai
 The car of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi rose to fame
 kejariwal ek purv iares adhikari hai to kiran bedi purv ipies yani donon kii class ek hi he or khaas baat ye ki donon ne hi apni naukari puri hone se pehle sarkari naukari ko alavida kah diya
 Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi's main field of work is Delhi
 lekin aam aadmi party kii chintaa yahaan se shuru hoti he ki kiran bedi middle class main bada naam maani jaati jo dilli kii raajnneeti main ek bada votbank he
 The famous Kejriwal was also very much in the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections, but after leaving the government, the graph of Kejriwal and his party dropped in the middle class
 saare opinian pole main mukhyamantri ummidavaar ke taur par kejariwal nirvivaad rup se pehali pasand bane rahe isliye aam aadmi party kejariwal kaa cheharaa aage rakhkar chunaav lard rahi thi or bijepi par sidhaa hamalaa karke puuchhati thi ki bataao siem ummidavaar koun he aapkaa? or bijepi ke paas kejariwal kii takkar kaa netaa dilli main tha nahin
 Especially that which is so popular
 bijepi piem modi kaa cheharaa saamne rakhkar prachaar kar to rahi thi, lekin phir baat ye aati thi ki modi to piem hai, siem thodi banenge
 Although the announcement of Kiran Bedi's name as CM candidate would have been difficult, but after discussing it in the media and public, one can definitely get the impression that if BJP wins, it will become CM Kiran Bedi
 lekin ab zaraa dekhie ki kejariwal ne kiran bedi ke liye twit kar kaha ki ''main hameshaa kiran bedi kaa prashansak rahaa hum
 i always tried to convince him to get into politics
 mujhe khushi he ki aaj wo raajnneeti main aa hi gayi'' That is, Kejriwal is still not getting into any kind of accusations, attacks, taunts etc
 like he no longer attacks PM Modi but just targets BJP
 or na hi kiran bedi arvind kejariwal ke upar tippanee kar rahi hai
 Once these two are weighed in the scales of the experience of politics, it is seen that where Kejriwal formed his own separate party, formed an organization, started a journey from zero and fought fiercely against the already established two national parties
 pichley chunaav main 15 saal se satta par kabiz dilli se congress ko nipataakar in chunaavon main bhi bijepi kii naak main damakar karke rakhaa he
 Kejriwal did what he did on his own and the entire party rests on his price
 to vahiin kiran bedi ko apana safar shuru karne ke liye platform to pehle se taiyaar mila, jis party main shaamil hui wo pehle hi apane jeevankaal ke svarnim daur main chal rahi he or desh jeetne ke baad ek ke baad ek rajya apane naam karte ja rahi he
 The party is already in form and even if Kiran Bedi does not have much experience of politics, she will not have to do all the work herself, she will also handle those who have brought her into the party
 kejariwal ke saamne abhitak in chunaavon main keval ek hi chunauti thi ki unako janata ko ye samajhaana tha ki unhone sarkaar kyon chodi or istifa kyon diya? kyonki baaki sab mudde utane bade janata kii nazar main nahin dikhte or kejariwal apni lokapriyata main giravat dekhte hue bhi apni eemaandaar chhavi ke kaaran siem candidet ke taur par pehali pasand bane hue the, lekin ab unako ek chunauti se or nipatna hoga kyonki bijepi ne eemaandaar chhavi kaa jawaab eemaandaar chhavi se or lokapriy chehre kaa jawaab lokapriy chehre ke taur par de diya he
 One thing is also that Kiran Bedi is the name who has strong chances of being the bjp's CM candidate, as well as the Aam Aadmi Party has also offered him to become the CM candidate of Delhi
 to kya bijepi ne kiran bedi ko laakar apana master stroke khelaa he? If yes, the question is, what is Kejriwal's answer? yah jawaab hi batayega ki dilli ke dangal main kejariwal kii daavedaari kitni majboot he

 pradhyumna kii maut ko 4 din kaa vakt biit chukaa he, lekin abhi bhi kuch aise sawaal hai jinka jawaab police nahin de pai he yaa phir tafteesh kii majaburi jataakar dena nahin chaahati he
 The police in its press conference did not even respond to what happened to Pradyuman on that day
 How he reached the bathroom, how the bus conductor reached the bathroom
 uske paas wo chaaku kahaan se aayaa or kya vaardaat ke vakt bathrum ke aasapaas teacher yaa bachche maujuud the yaa nahin
 Delhi Aaj Tak is also asking some similar questions to Gurugram Police
 kaise hui giraftaar, kahaan gaye khun se sane kapade?police ke mutabik, conductor ashok ne kukarm kii koshish ke dauraan bachche kaa galaa kaata or logon ke use dekh lene par khud hi use uthaakar skool ke logon ke saath aspataal le gaya
 a school gardener saw Ashok washing a blood-stained knife, after which Ashoka himself made a noise to avoid getting trapped and started picking up the child and running away
 isi mali kii nishandehi par ashok kii giraftaar hui, lekin jab ashok giraftaar hua to kya wo khun se sane kapado main tha yaa ghar jaakar apane kapade badal chukaa tha
 This is a big question, the police is silent on this
 range haath kyon nahin hui giraftaar?police kii theory ke mutabik, agar skool ke mali ne ashok ko bathrum main chaaku dhote hue dekh liya tha to phir usee vakt uske kehane par yaa student or teacher ke dekhne par aaropee ashok ko range haathon kyon nahin pakadaa gaya
 Somewhere the school management is not trying to hide or suppress anything
 police ke paas is sawaal kaa bhi koi jawaab nahin he
 Why did the school clean the blood? Pradyuman's housemates have also complained that the school management had cleared the blood stains in the bathroom even before the police arrived
 sawaal ye he ki skool prashasan ne police ke pahunchane tak ghatnasthal ko jas kaa tas kyon nahin choda
 With which forensic evidence could be collected
 police is maamle par bhi khamosh he or skool prashasan ke khilaaf sirf jeje act ke tahat karrwai kar rahi he
 Whereas, the school should also take action under Section 201 of the IPC for the charge of erasing evidence
 chaaku kaa raaj ab bhi ansulajhaa?police ke mutabik, aaropee bas ke tul box se chaaku lekar use dhone ke liye bathrum gaya tha
 While there is usually no knife in the tool box
 ab sawaal ye he ki ye chaaku aaropee khud kharid kar laayaa tha yaa kisi or kaa tha
 Police are silent on the issue of carrying knives in the bathroom
 mahaj 15 minute main kaise ho gai vaardaat?tathyon ke mutabik, pradhyumna ke pita ne use 7
 Did drop at the school gate at 55
 jabaki mahaj 15 minute baad unhen bachche ke lahooluhaan hone kii khabar mil gai
 In such a situation, the question is, how did this incident happen so soon, even when the bathroom is just ten steps away from her class
 us vakt class se lekar corndor main bahut se bachche maujuud the
 The police also have no answer to this question

 In response to questions from reporters in Guna, Singh said, "the results of giving autonomy to the CBI will be better, it also poses a question mark
 use swaittata dena aisa hi he, jaise kisi thanedaar ko swaittata dena
 "he asked," Is the common man entitled to give autonomy to a police station
 ’’ The matter of giving autonomy to the CBI has gained momentum after the Supreme Court described the investigating agency as a 'caged parrot'
 congress mahasachiv ne ashanka jataai ki aane vaale samay main desh kii adaalatein kahin raashtrapati or pradhanmantri jaise padon ko lekar tippaniyan nahin karne lag jaaen, yadi aisa hua, to loktantr kaa vartmaan dhaancha evam santulan prabhavit ho saktaa he
 He said that the legislature, executive and judiciary should work in their respective areas, so that their dignity is not disturbed
 congress mahasachiv ne kaha, ‘‘meri chintaa, aam aadmi kii jigyaasa jaisi he ki hamaare desh main nyaaypalika, karypalika evam vidhayika ke samanvay tathaa har santhaan ke prati aadar kaa bhav hi, prajatantr kaa aadhaar he
 '' vidhayika kaa adhikaar kanoon bananaa, karypalika kaa us par amal karnaa tathaa nyaaypalika kaa kaam kisi paksh dwaara vidhaan ke vipareet kaary karne par use sajaa dena he
 He said that interference in each other's territory would bring down the respect of these constitutional bodies
 tippaniyan They do not understand that if the judiciary lodges an objection in writing, it can be appealed, but the question of where to appeal the comment like 'cage in a cage' to the CBI is unanswered, because it Comment is not in writing
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main singh ne kaha ki unhone nyaaypalika ke vipareet koi tippanee nahin kii he, keval sibiai ko ‘pinjre main band tota’ kehane par aapatti kii he

 The Congress General Secretary expressed the apprehension that in the coming years the courts of the country may not start making comments about the posts of President and Prime Minister, if this happens, then the current structure and balance of democracy may be affected
 unhone kaha ki vidhayika, karypalika evam nyaaypalika ko apane-apane kshetra main rahakar kaam karnaa chahie, jisase unki maryaada bhang nahin ho
 Congress General Secretary said, "my concern is like the curiosity of the common man that in our country, coordination of judiciary, executive and legislature and respect for every institution is the basis of democracy
" '' The legislature has the authority to enact laws, execute the executive and the job of the judiciary is to punish it if any party acts contrary to the law
 unhone kaha ki ek duusare ke kshetra main hastkshep in sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ke sammaan main giravat laaegi
 The comments unhen samaj nahin aata ki nyaaypalika yadi likhit main koi aapatti darj karaati he, to uski apil kii ja sakati he, lekin sibiai ke liye ‘pinjraa main band tota’ jaisi tippanee kii apil kis sthaan par kii jaae, yah sawaal anuttarit he, kyonki yah tippanee likhit main nahin he
 In response to a question, Singh said that he had not made any comment contrary to the judiciary, only objected to the CBI being called a 'caged parrot'
 vah nyaaypalika kaa bharpoor sammaan karte hai

 cpm's new general secretary Sitaram Yechury was seen congratulating his comrades and all the journalists, as well as the staff at the airport
 yechuri sipiem ke paanchaven mahasachiv bane hai jinke saamne vajood khatm hone ke gambhir sankat se jujh rahi is vampanthi party ko dobaaraa zindaa karne kii chunauti he
 But when the new CPM general secretary Yechury was accepting greetings from everyone, then at that time this comrade, who had been raising the party flag for 45 years, was crying his grief in front of me
 sunit chopra kaa cheharaa hameshaa mujhe karl marks jaisaa lagata he
 He is an art critic
 apane bebaak vichaaron or khuli nidar raay ke liye party main jane jate hai
 i was surprised that at such crucial times when the party is churning on its shortcomings, comrades like Chopra have been removed from the Central Committee
 ‘aapako hataane kii koi khaas vajah? shaayad aap apane kala kshetra se jude kaam main vyast rahanaa chaahate hai
 'I say
 ‘no no, cimpli vandata
 '(no no, just a feeling of revenge) He says and i am shocked
 aamtaur par kamred media waalon se khulkar kabhi is tarah party ke khilaaf nahin bolte
 'but why? ‘shaayad unhen chapalusee karne vaale pasand hai
 'chopra does not appear to be in any mood of restraint
 ‘kab party main shaamil huye the aap sar’ 'in 1972' ‘oh
 i was not even born then
 ’ mere munh se anayas hi nikal jaataa he
 'think
 ’ vah kehete hai
 Are you talking to us off the record or can we write it
 ek bade angrezi akhbaar ke saathi kehete hai
 'no no, you write
 main khulkar bol rahaa hum
 'pens and notebooks come in our hands
 ‘kya vajah ho sakati he aapako hataane kii
 ' ‘ye log unako pasand nahin karte jo inke khilaaf bolte hai
 For the last 10 years, i have been continuously counting his shortcomings in the party
 yaad he na aapako?’ i remembered that when the CPM leaders kept silent or made statements while hiding the party's deficiencies from the media on the declining mass base of the party in Nandigram, Singur and Bengal and in Kerala, Sunit Chopra was unmindful and the truth even before the media Not afraid to accept
 aaj sunit chopra vishakhapattanam airport par logon se mil rahe or aupchaariktavash hansbol kar baat kar rahe the lekin kya unka hashr sipiem ke un netaaon jaisaa hi hone ja rahaa he jo party kii hawa ke khilaaf bolne kii sajaa pate hai
 Many years ago, Saifuddin Chaudhary and later Somnath Chatterjee were sentenced to speak out of the party's thinking or disobey the orders
 tippaniyan Sunit Chopra was a young man from a flourishing family who came to India after studying in England
 maine hameshaa unako bahut saadhaaran kurte pyjame or hawaii chappal main hi dekha
 i remember long ago he told me that he never took anything from the party
 bas use sab kuch dene kii hi sochi
 He has been on the CPM Central Committee for 20 years and today he was accusing Prakash Karat, one of the biggest leaders of CPM, of removing himself
 vah kehete hai ki unhen karaat kii haa main haa milaane kii sajaa bhugatni padi
 i had heard from the new CPM general secretary Yechury 24 hours ago that the party is self-critical and its new face will be seen
 lekin kya sunit chopra jaise logon ke liye usamen jagah nahin hogi
 'you can also be withdrawn in the Central Committee of the Comrade Party
 ’ main unhen dilasa dene kii koshish karata hum
 'certainly not
 main kisi ke rahamo karam par jeena nahin chahta
 Better to die than flattery
 ’ chopra kehete hai or vimaan ke daravaaje kii ore chale jate hai
 But when the new CPM general secretary Yechury was accepting greetings from everyone, then at that time this comrade, who had been raising the party flag for 45 years, was crying his grief in front of me

 and the country's identity
 is prakaar ke inke raajnneetik va sarkari kaaryakramon ko sidhe taur par deshbhakti se jod diya jaataa he

 When Asaram's most important Rajdar Shilpi arrived at the door of the law, he started telling himself and Asaram innocent, but as soon as Shilpi was confronted by the Jodhpur Police, the tone of the artisan changed
 jodhpur police sutron ke mutabik shuruuaat main to shilpi ne police ko ghumaane kii puri koshish kii lekin iske baad jaise hi police ne sabooton ko saamne rakh kar sawaalon ke tir chode shilpi ghayal honi shuru ho gai
 After this, after Shilpi started spewing sholay, now the heat of her heat is going to burn Asaram even more
 shilpi khud se pehle asaram ko bekasoor bataa rahi hai
 She is saying that Asaram is being implicated
 are shilpi ji, agar sachmuch aapako laga tha ki asaaram ko fansaaya ja rahaa he to maheene bhar tak baapu ko is haal main kyon choda? kyon nahin maheene bhar pehle hi aakar sach bolaa ki baapu par lage saare aarope galat hai jabaki aapke asaram ke baad sabase bada aarope to aap par hi he
 It is alleged that the girl who was sexually abused took you to Asaram in Jodhpur's exile
 agar aap sachmuch bekasoor thim or asaram begunaah ko maheene bhar tak kisase munh chupa rahi thim or kyon?jaahir he shilpi puraa sach nahin bol rahi he
 But according to the Jodhpur Police, what Shilpi has told the police in the last twenty-four hours after surrender is completely different from this dialogue of Shilpi
 haridwar se lekar ahmedabad or ahmedabad se lekar chhindwara tak ke gurukul main padhane vaali ladakiyon or baapu ke ekantavaas kaa sach, shilpi sab bol rahi he, sab raaj ugal rahi he
 Such secrets which are going to put Asaram in more trouble
 zaahir he shilpi ke paas raaj kam nahin hai lekin kuch raaj aise hai, jinke khulne ke saath hi asaram ke liye museebataan or badhanevaali hai
 The police have asked Shilpi when she finally came in contact with Asaram? When did he decide to dedicate his life to Asaram and why Asaram sent him from Ahmedabad to Haridwar and then from Haridwar to Chhindwara? It is also necessary for the police to know all this because this time the girl who accused Asaram of sexual exploitation , The girl was first seen by Asaram in Haridwar
 asaram kii raajadaar shilpi kaa samarpan kanoon ke kasate shikanje kaa kamaal tha yaa phir shilpi ke samarpan ke peeche kahani kuch or he? ye sawaal tab or zyada ahm ho jate hai, jab shilpi ke guru asaram kii zamaanat yachika nichali adaalat main khaarij hone ke baad ab hai court ke faisale kaa intazaar kar rahi he lekin isse pehle ki hai court kaa asaram kii jamaanat par koi faisla aae, khud unheen ke vakil ram jethmalani kuch subut jutaney ke liye hai court se 15 dinon kii mohalat le lete hai jabaki aam taur par jamaanat ke maamalon main aisi mohalat bachaav paksh nahin, abhiyojan paksh kii taraf se liye jate hai, taaki jamaanat ko zyada se zyada vaqt ke liye taala ja sake lekin yahaan maamla ulta he or mohalat kii maang desh ke sabase bade vakeelon main se ek khud ram jethmalani kii taraf se kii jaati he
 Apparently, Jethmalani must have been realizing that his demand would set his client back behind bars for a few more days, but despite this demand, Asaram pleaded for an extension of the court and he They also get it
 in mohalat ke dinon main jethmalani kya subut juta rahe hai ye to nahin pataa lekin isi mohalat ke bich shilpi kaa hai court main agrim jamaanat ke liye arzi lagaana or uske khaarij hone ke baad uskaa jodhpur ke seshan court main samarpan karnaa apane aap main kaaphi kuch kahata he
 In fact, Jodhpur police sources and law experts believe that instead of prolonging the investigation of Jethmalani police, they want to reach a point so that after the initial investigation, the police should file the challan at the earliest
 And they should be more comfortable requesting bail for Asaram
 desh ke is namchin vakil kii is vyuu rachana se aage shilpi ke itane dinon tak gaayab rahane ke peeche bhi apane-aap main ek lambii kahani he
 Apparently, Asaram is the main accused in the sexual abuse case, while Shilpi is accused of helping him
 
 
 lekin itnaa hote hue bhi mukhya aaropee to police kii giraft main aa jaataa he, lekin shilpi kaa koi pataa nahin chalata
 So, should it be assumed that Shilpi was still absconding on her own or that her people had sheltered Shilpi at the behest of Asaram? If police sources were to believe that they were the people of Asaram, now Shilpi Who was hiding with whom she was waiting for the gesture of her mentor and when Asaram's bail application from the lower court was rejected, it reached the High Court and his lawyer took leave from the High Court, then Asara Who brought his talk to the dedication of craftsmen and artisans who surrendered in the sessions court of Jodhpur all under the nose of the Jodhpur Police, Jodhpur Police had so many days hand wash after her
 jodhpur seshan court main samarpan ke dauraan jo shilpi apane asaram ko har tarah se bekasoor bataa rahi thi, usee shilpi ne kuch rose pehle kaha tha ki wo asaram ko jaanati hi nahin he
 We are not saying this, rather it is written that in the anticipatory bail application given by Shilpi, which she had filed in the session court of Jodhpur on 4 September, but this was not the first time, while Shilpi did not have any relation with Asaram Said isse pehle bhi jab 23 agast ko jodhpur police ne shilpi se chhindwara ashram main poochtacha kii, tab bhi shilpi ne asaram se apni koi mulaakaat nahin hone kii baat kahi thi balki tab to usne police se yahaan tak kaha tha ki usne 15 march ko hi chhindwara ashram main naukari jwine kii he or use to yahaan sirf chah maheene hi hue hai
 But now the police are getting to know about Shilpi, she removes the veil from this lie
 shilpi urf sanchita gupta naa sirf bachapan se asaram kii bhakt thi, balki uske mata-pita bhi asaram ke hi shisht the
 Even with his parents, he also took initiation from Asaram and then decided to stay in the Ahmedabad ashram of Taumra Asaram
 raipur se manovigyaan main eme karanevaali shilpi shuru se hi tej tarraar thi or usne khud ko asaram ke paas samarpit kar diya tha
 Asaram was in need of a similar girl as his royalty, and upon seeing Shilpi, he gave him not only responsibility but a lot of authority
 ab shilpi asaram ke ishaare par ek-ek kar ladakiyon ko fans kar asaram ke saamne samarpan ke liye bhejne lagi
 For this, she often told girls to be ghosts and insisted on getting Asaram treated
 peedit ladki ne police ko die bayaan main bataaya he ki shilpi hameshaa ek kaagaj main bhoot-preton ke bare main kuch likh kar rakhti or duusari ladakiyon ne tarah hi shilpi ne use bhi bhoot-pret kaa shikaar hone kii baat kahi thi or shilpi ne chhindwara ke gurukul kii ek ladki ko bhi kuch aisa hi jhansa diya tha jo is maamle ke saamne aane ke baad se hi philhal faraar he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has become a party always in action mode for elections
 bijepi chunaav ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahati he
 BJP sets a big target in the election of any state, for this, from the party worker to the president, they commit their lives 
 lekin desh kii rajdhani dilli main bijepi ke liye raah aasaan nahin he
 BJP swept the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 is chunaav main dilli kii saaton siton par bijepi ne kabja kar liya he
 At the same time, after 6 months, there is an assembly election in Delhi, on which the BJP has started preparations
 is chunaav ko jeetne ke liye ranneeti taiyaar kii ja rahi he, jiske maddenjar lagaataar baithken bulaai ja rahi hai
 In these meetings, Delhi bjp's organization minister Siddharthan is meeting with the Assembly Wise leaders about where the booth wise lacked in the Lok Sabha elections and where there is a need to work
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki abhi kuch hi din pehle vipaksh kaa supada saaf karne vaali dilli bijepi dilli vidhansabha kii 70 siton kii jagah 60 siton ko hi kyon jeetna chaahati he
 The BJP has set a target of winning 60 of the 70 assembly seats in Delhi in view of the assembly elections
 iske maddenjar 8 or 9 june ko baithak bulaai jaaegi jisamen kis seat par kaisaa sameekaran tay karnaa he is par charchaa kii jaaegi
 According to the bjp's election analysis, according to the assembly seats, BJP has got a bumper victory in 65 seats in Delhi, while in 5 assembly segments, the BJP has lagged behind the Congress
 dilli loksabhaa main 7 siten hai or har seat ke antargat kareeb 10 vidhansabha kshetra aate hai
 An analysis of the votes cast at these booths shows that BJP has won 13,816 booths in Delhi but BJP has lost 10,088 booths
 in boothon main zyaadaatar muslim bahul ilaake hai to kuch cluster ilaake bhi hai
 If we look at the assembly wise, BJP has lost 5 out of 70 seats, there are 7 assembly seats in Delhi which are considered as Muslim majority areas
 lekin 7 main se 5 siton par bijepi kii haar hui he jabaki 2 sito par bahut kam margin se bijepi jiti he
 While there have been bumper votes in other places, which have lost the assembly seats, BJP has lost in Seelampur, an assembly constituency under the North Eastern Parliamentary constituency, where MP Manoj Tiwari is
 vahiin manoj tiwari ke sansadeey kshetra main aane vaale do vidhansabha kshetra babarpur or mustafabad main bahut kam antar se jiti he
 BJP has lost from Okhla Assembly Constituency in East Delhi Parliamentary Constituency, where MP Gautam Gambhir is, while BJP has lost from three Assembly Constituencies Matia Mahal, Chandni Chowk and Ballimaran under Chandni Chowk Parliamentary Constituency
 chandani chowk vidhansabha kshetra se bijepi ke haar kaa antar bahut kam he
 The MP from here is Dr
 Harsh Vardhan
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki ham jitna kar sakate hai, usase do kadam peeche hi rakhte hai jisase hamako kahin kal ulataa nahin dekhnaa pade
 BJP has been out of power in Delhi for 22 years
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bijepi dilli ke saaton siton par jeet hasil kii thi lekin 8 maheene baad hi 2015 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi 3 siton par simat gai
 Although the BJP has won a big victory in the Lok Sabha elections, but in the Delhi Assembly elections, the BJP is very relaxed
 dilli main 2020 main dilli kaa vidhansabha chunaav hone vaale hai
 The BJP fears that the 2014 mistake may not be repeated
 bijepi netaaon kaa bhi maananaa he ki dilli main sthaneey muddon par chunaav lade jate hai
 There is a lot of difference between Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections, in which the BJP is also scared
 bijepi is baar ummid main he ki shaayad 22 saal dilli kii rajgaddi se dur rahane ke baad is baar dilli par bijepi kaa kabja ho sake

 The session was attended by poet and critic Ashok Vajpayee, writer and critic Nirmala Jain and poet Gagan Gill
 teenon lekhakon ne krishna sobati or namvar singh ke lekhan ko yaad kiya or sahitya main unke yogadan ke bare main jaankaree di

 vaajapeyi ne kaha ki krishna ne apni ek bhashaa gadhi jisamen hindi, punjabi sabhi shaamil he
 He has a fixed language and each character speaks his own language
 kathin halaat main bhi manushya hona or manushya bane rahanaa sambhav he, yah krishna sobati ne hamen bataaya

 He said that Krishna ji i practically miss in addition to writing
 krishna ji kii maa unke lekhan or man bhi hameshaa raheen or vah aakhir tak unki seva karti raheen
 Nirmala said that Krishna Sobti had written it 50 years ago, what should be the female discourse

 lekin baad main jaakar unhone shivnathji ke saath sambandh aakhir tak nibhaayaa jo umr main unase chote the
 The dark shows the mind of Namvar Gagan, remembering Krishna Sobti, that even after reading his book today, one would like to behold nature, heart to live that moment more

 Otherwise, he was capable of solving every problem
 namvar singh ke bare main ashok vaajapeyi ne kaha ki maine unhen achook avasarwaadi kaha tha kyonki vah pathak ko dekhakar tay karte hai ki unako kya kahana chahie
 But Gagan's hope about them is not unfounded

 Since then, the fight has continued between the two
 beete november kii 23 taarikh ko lakhanu main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne jo yuva vichaar mahakumbh yojit kiya, usamen udaasi or sankalp kaa maahaul ek saath tari tha
 More than 5,000 youths from the extended Sangh Parivar — that is, the Bharatiya Janata Party, its student organization Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and other organizations — had gathered in the capital of Uttar Pradesh
 ise 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon kii taiyaari ke silsile main ahm rashtriya muddon par dimagi manthan kaa satr bataaya gaya tha
 When the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath stood up to speak at the inaugural session as a guest of honor, there was a sudden commotion at the venue
 is shorgul ke bich se awaajen uthne lageen: ''jo mandir banayega, vot usee ko jayega
 This slogan was a sign of the fact that in the presence of rss-co-sarkaryavah Dattatreya Hosabale and Krishna Gopal and the Deputy Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh — Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma — in this organization known for its disciplined activists
 The issue of the temple for the family has become politically inconvenient
 aresas ke bade netaaon ke dakhal dene or yuvaaon ko shant karne ke baad hi yogi kuch minute ke antaraal se bhaashan shuru kar sake
 However, two days later on 25 November, when the RSS organized rallies across the country to insist on bringing an ordinance to build the Ram temple, this mother organization was ready to give more space to the opinion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP
 (hosabale was an exception in Bengaluru)
 sangh ke andruni sutara daawa karte hai ki unke hamalon ke nishane par 'mandir-virdohi takatein' zyada thim or shaayad supreme court bhi kyonki usne ayodhya ke maamle kii sunwaayee ko praathamikta nahin di thi
 RSS leaders now say that this too was part of a nap-and-balance strategy to keep pressure on the BJP government at the Center
 ahm baat yah he ki uske baad se hi ram mandir par laffaaji ke swar ko thodaa naram kar diya gaya he
 Even the Modi's statement in an interview last week that his government would investigate other options only after the court's verdict was not reacted in the family as it could have on his apparent stubbornness
 aamtaur par ladaaku mudra main rahane vaali sant brigade ne bhi is par shanti banaae rakhi
 The RSS even issued a statement welcoming Modi's stand
 jehar ugalane vaali vihip ke rashtriya sachiv rajendra pankaj kaa bayaan bhi, ummid or dharre ke ulat, dukh or pashchaatap se bharaa tharu ''sheersh adaalat ko chahie ki vah mandir mudde ko praathamikta de
 His stance is painful for Hindu society
 yah kehane ke uparaant ham pradhanmantri ke us bayaan kaa swaagat karte hai ki adaalat kaa vikalp khatm hone ke baad hi duusare vikalpon ko liya jayega
 The VHP will raise the issue again in its Parliament of Religions held at the Kumbh Mela on 31 January
 ''is baar vihip-aresas kii pratikriya us aakraamak abhiyaan se bilkul ulat he jo usne 2002-2004 main bhaajapa kii aguai vaali atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ke khilaaf chalaaya tha
 So what was the reason for such a provocation in the young Vichar Mahakumbh of Lucknow? Was it just a spectacle that was played on 16 November as part of a consent meeting in Delhi between a top BJP leader, RSS and VHP office bearers and two prominent lawyers? It is said that in this meeting there was a deep discussion on the temple issue and a strategy was made
 baatcheet ke aakhir main bhaajapa ke netaa ne aresas or vihip ke ohadedaaron se jahiraa taur par kaha, ''aap desh ke naujavaanon ke bich ram mandir ko lekar maahaul tej karen, baaki hamaare upar chhod den
 It is said that sources close to Modi also sent the same message to the top RSS officials
 apana daanv badhaane ke liye modi yaa bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah jaldi hi ayodhya main vivaadit sthal kii saarvajanik yatra par ja sakate hai
 Of course, this new strategy also aims to increase public pressure on the apex court, especially when Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi overturned the direction of his predecessor Deepak Mishra, stating that the temple issue was not a priority and the next hearing 4 January date was fixed (on this date, Gogoi said that a bench of three members would hear the issue from January 10)
 mandir mudde ke paroksh pakshakaar akhil bhartiya sant samaaj ke mahasachiv swami jitendranand saraswati adaalat ke rukh kii kadi aalochana karte hai
 "justice should not only be there, it should also be seen as happening
" mandir maamle ko praathamikta na dekar adaalat nyaayashastra ke siddhanton ke khilaaf kaam kar rahi ho sakati he
 Modi's latest stance should be seen against the backdrop of the Sangh Parivar leaders believing that their favor in favor of the temple at the disputed site is so strong that if the court does a fast track hearing then the verdict in their favor after a few hearings will come
 modi or shah ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki agar ve mandir mudde par aakhirkaar adhyadesh laane kaa faisla karte hai, to is mudde par shor-sharaaba badhaane se use sahi tehraane main bhi madad milegi
 The top leadership of the BJP, however, is not taking any risk
 bataaya jaataa he ki khaskar modi 1992-93 ke mandir prasang kii duhai dete hai jab babari masjid dhaha die jane ke baad us vakt congress kii aguai vaali centre sarkaar ne bhaajapa kii chaar rajya sarkaron ko barkhaast kar diya tha or chah maheene baad jab chunaav hue to bhaajapa inamen se do rajyon main satta nahin laut saki thi
 a senior party official says, "before taking any decision, we have to assess how much support there is among the people on this issue
" '' iske alaava modi shiddat se chaahate hai ki ve or unki party aane vaale loksabhaa chunaav achche rajkaaj ke unke record kii takat par laden, bajaae iske ki ram mandir sareekhe bhaavnaatmak dharmik mudde uthaae jaaen
 The Prime Minister is also wary about the possible violence in the country on the temple issue, which could affect the party's prospects
 is bich sangh se jude netaaon kii ek raay he ki aam logon ke bich ram mandir ke mudde par jabardast samarthan kaayam he
 He cites the heavy presence of youth in dozens of rallies led by the RSS on the temple issue after November
 inamen se chaar reliyon main to lakh se upar logon kii maujuudagi bataai gai
 They also point out that the official spokesperson of the Congress is cutting the trough from the TV debates on the issue
 bhaajapa ke yuva morche ke purv upaadhyaksh or rajnatik vishleshak swadesh singh kehete hai, ''congress ke bade netaa is mudde par media ke saamne aane se kataraa rahe hai, yah pakkaa ishaara he ki unhen dar he ki logon ke bich is mudde kii ahmiyat or vajan he
 "congress leaders say that this is the right strategy, because any omission or wrong step can upset Rahul Gandhi's nefarious strategy of 'soft Hindutva' in the electoral race
" rajasthan kii chunavi daud ke dauraan purv kendriya mantri si
 P
 joshi ko us vakt anushaasan kaa paath padhaayaa gaya tha, jab unhone kaha tha ki ''keval congress hi ram mandir bana sakati he
 The BJP will only exploit it for political gains
 '' bataaya jaataa he ki party ke sheersh netritv ne is bayaan ke liye joshi kii khinchaai kii thi
 Modi and Shah and other big leaders of the BJP still feel that support in the urban areas, especially among the referendum segments, on the Ram temple issue is not very strong yet
 bhaajapa ke ek sheersh netaa ne india today se kahah ''mandir kaa mudda utana garm nahin he jitna 1992 main tha, haalanki gramin ilaakon main isaki ab bhi kaaphi gunj he, shahari ilaakon main hamen maahaul bananaa hoga
 "in his recently addressed rallies, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also admitted that" the government should bring an ordinance on the Ram temple, for this we have to mobilize public support as governments only lead to public support
 " '' dekhte rahiye aage-aage hota he kya

 lekin katrina ne salmaan kii film bharat sin karne ke kuch hi maheenon ke baad remo kii film se walkout kar liya
 The reason for Katrina's leaving the Street Dancer 3D film has now been revealed

 On this, Katrina said that due to the date clash of both the films i have backout
 katrina ne kaha, 'film street dancer ke saath nyaay karne ke liye main bharat ko puraa samay nahin de paati or naa film ke liye extra chijen shoot kar paati
 So i made this decision
 main apane is faisle se khush hum
 Katrina further revealed that India is a special film for her
 wo bharat main kaam kar ke khush hai, kyonki unhen lagata he ki aisi film or role karne kaa mauka shaayad unhen dobaaraa nahin milegaa
 View this post on instagrampromotions today 💙A post shared bykatrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) onmay 31, 2019 at 10:20 am PDT Katrina also revealed that even though she has not been a part of Street Dancer 3D, Varun Dhawan is her good friend And those people often talk on chat
 bataa den, katrina ke street dancer 3di film chhodane ke baad ye film shraddha kapur ko mil gai thi

 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii tabiyat behad najuk he
 Vajpayee's health admitted in AIIMS Hospital in New Delhi has worsened in the last 24 hours
 pradhanmantri narendra modi samet kai kendriya mantri unki tabiyat kaa pataa karne pahunche
 Vajpayee's status is very high in Indian politics, leaders respect him by moving away from the party line
 1998 main jab vaajapeyi pradhanmantri the, tab unki aguwai main bharat ne parmaanu pareekshan kiya tha
 The whole world was stunned by this decision
 11 may 1998 ko rajasthan capokharanmen teen bamon ke safal pareekshan ke saath bharat newclear state ban gaya
 It was a proud moment for the country
 aise main agar poocha jaae ki bharat ko parmaanu raashtra banane vaala pradhanmantri koun? jawaab milegaa atal bihari vaajapeyi
 However, on 19 March 1998, for the second time, Atal had to enter into agreements with several regional parties to sit on the Prime Minister's chair
 isliye bharat ko parmaanu raashtra bananaa itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 Let us know how Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given the green signal to the nuclear state during his time as PM
 1998 main bhartiya janata party ‘desh kii parmaanu niti kaa or parmaanu astron ko tainaat karne ke vikalp kaa punarmoolyankan’ karne tak ko taiyaar ho gai thi
 It also had an impact on the party's image
 april 1998 main raksha adhyayan or vishleshan santhaan (IDSA) ke nideshak jasjit singh ne kaha tha, ‘unki (bijepi kii) chhavi to aisi he ki wo maano pehla kaam hi parmaanu bam ke pareekshan kaa karenge, lekin unhone kaaphi sanyam dikhaaya he
 In such a situation, it can be said that Jasjeet Singh had no idea of the test to be held in Pokhran next month
 newclear test kaa kaam parde ke peeche jari tha
 At the same time, in 1998, Army Chief VP Malik had put the demand of the Army openly in front
 21 april 1998 ko unhone kaha tha, ‘parmaanu astron or prakshepastron kii badhati chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye sarkaar sena kii ranneetik pratirodh kshamta viksit kare
 Just two days after the demand from the Army Chief, APJ Abdul Kalam, Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defense informed the Defense Minister's committee about the nuclear project
 is samiti kii adhyakshata us samay ke rakshaamantri jorge furnandis kar rahe the
 Atal also wanted to test quickly because Pakistan, showing China's nuclear weapons, successfully tested the Gauri missile
 pakistan ke soochna mantri mushahid hossain gauri ke vikaas ko ‘dakshin asia main shakti santulan kaa prayaas’ bataa rahe the
 Apart from Gauri, Pak was also working on 'ghaznavi missile'
 vahiin china-pakistan kii santh-ganth ke alaava america or japan samet kai pashchimi desh bharat par CTBT par sin karne ke liye dabaav daal rahe the
 On that hot afternoon of May 11, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called a press conference at his official house 7 Race Course
 isi press conference main atal ne parmaanu yojana kii jaankaree di
 However, former PM PV Narasimha Rao owes the Atal Bihari Atomic Test
 raav ko shradhanjali dete hue atal ne kaha tha, ‘may 1996 main jab maine raav ke baad pradhanmantri kii kursi sanbhali, to unhone mujhe bataaya tha ki bam taiyaar he
 i have just exploded
 ’ asal main raav disambar 1995 main pareekshan kii taiyaari kar chuke the, lekin tab unhen kisi vajah se apana mansuba multavee karnaa padaa
 Many theories are counted behind this
 india today kii ek report daawa karti he ki bahut hi kam log is baat ko jaanate hai ki 1996 kii apni 13 dinon kii sarkaar main atal ne jo iklauta faisla kiya tha, wo parmaanu kaarykram ko hari jhandi dene kaa tha
 But when he felt that his government was not stable, he canceled this decision
 in sari ghatnaon se ek baat to tay he ki raav or atal, donon hi parmaanu kaarykram ko lekar gambhir the or har haal main pareekshan karnaa chaahate the
 Vajpayee credited this nuclear test in many of his speeches to the Chairman of the Department of Atomic Energy
 chidambaram or duusare raksha anusandhan or vikaas santhaan ke pramukh apije abdul kalam ko bhi diya
 Let us tell you that on the third day of the test on May 11, a day after Paramutest, camera teams of foreign TV networks were roaming all over Delhi
 wo pokharan pareekshan ke khilaaf pradarshan karne vaale logon ko dhund rahe the, taaki unhen bharat sarkaar kii aalochana karne kaa koi sira mili
 But alas, he did not get a chance to take a single photo
 landan kii sadakon main to hadein hi paar ho gayi
 a 21-year-old youth driving by Naked had to get a helicopter to catch the police
 hanfighton post main chhapi report ke mutabik british county hertfordshire main ek yuvak neude hokar sadak main betaratib tareeke se gaadi chalaane laga
 It was so busy driving that it did not stop even when traffic stopped by the police
 hertfordshire police kii ore se hajaaron chetavaniyaan dene ke baavjood bhi yah na rukaa
 6 police cars also could not stop it
 phir police ko harkar ise kaabo main karne ke liye helicopter bulaanaa padaa
 The arrested person was arrested after the helicopter arrived
 haalanki giraftaar ke baad is yuvak ko jamaanat dekar chhod diya gaya
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has directly attacked Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on the pretext of searching for uranium

 Sachin Tendulkar, who is a step away from the century, and VVS Laxman, who always targeted the Australian attack, showed their batting in a drawn match between India and Cricket Australia President XI, while young Rohit Sharma also scored a half-century in the first Test
 Presented his strong claim to the match
 tendulkar 92 or lakshmana 57 ran banaakar ritred out hokar pavilion laute taaki baaki ballebaajon ko bhi a5yaas kaa mauka mil sake
 After this, Rohit, who was in excellent form, also scored an unbeaten 56 runs
 is tarah se barish ke kaaran jab duusare or antim din samay se pehle match anirnit samaapt ghoshit kiya gaya tathaa bhartiya team ne chah wicket par 320 ran banaaye the
 The Indian bowlers had to contend yesterday and the President XI declared their innings ended by scoring 398 runs for six wickets but after losing the first wicket in the second over today, the Indian batsmen looked good for the first Test match starting in Melbourne on 26 December
 Practiced rahul dravid ne bhi dedh ghante krij par bitaakar 45 ran banaaye jabaki gautam gambhir ne ek ghante se adhik samay tak khelkar 35 ran kii pari kheli
 India started their innings in the morning but Ajinkya Rahane, who was included in the team as the third opener, could not impress the selectors and returned to the pavilion after scoring only three runs
 unhone tej gendbaaj jaik haverfield kii gend par camerun boyas ko kaich thamaya
 Tendulkar, who has missed the 100th century from the last 17 international innings, presented a brilliant example of his rhythm ahead of the Test series, while Laxman batted seamlessly on the Australian pitches as usual
 in donon ko adhyaksh ekadash ke kisi bhi gendbaaj ko khilne main dikkat nahin hui
 When Tendulkar and Laxman shared a 133-run partnership for the fourth wicket, both batsmen decided to leave the crease after the 61st over
 tendulkar tab apane shatak se keval aath ran dur the lekin unhen pataa he ki cricket premiyon ko unke is shatak kii nahin balki test maichon main saikade kaa intjaar he
 Tendulkar played 135 balls and hit 15 fours

 Kohli (1) was handed a catch back to Boise soon after landing, but Rohit enjoyed the batting from the other end and played several visible strokes

 congress party ne gujarat kii bijepi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya he ki usne kuch udyogpatiyon ko phayda pahunchane kaa kaam kiya he
 According to the Congress claim, during the tenure of the BJP government, the treasury of the state government has suffered a loss of about Rs 19,576 crore
 congress ke mutabik rajya sarkaar ko yah nuksaan 2003 main liye gaye faisle se hua he or khaas baat he ki is vakt kendra main bijepi sarkaar ke saath-saath rajya main narendra modi kii sarkaar thi
 Raising this issue ahead of the Gujarat elections, the Congress has questioned the Gujarat model of development being promoted by the BJP, saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should clarify this matter of corruption
 New layers in the 20,000 crore # modigspcscam2have revealed themselves, yet PM Modi refuses to bring transparency to issues involving taxpayer money and losses to the exchequer

 com / bdrctpwbqe — Congress (@incindia) December 8, 2017 Congress spokesperson Ajay Kumar has sought a clarification from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, questioning the issue of mining in the KG basin
 keji basin main khanan kaa adhikaar gujarat sarkaar kii company gujarat state petroleum corporation (jiespisi) ko 2003 main diya gaya tha
 It was only in March 2003 that GSPC entered into an agreement with foreign company Geoglobal Resources and gave 10 percent of the share to it
 The scams are adding up, but will the PM and his government care to answer these questions regarding GSPC, which are a matter of concern to every tax-paying citizen? # modigspcscam2pic
 twitter
 com / 5l7lugyoxs— Congress (@incindia)december 8, 2017jiske baad jiespisi par aarope laga tha ki jeeyoglobal kaa khanan main koi anubhav nahin hone ke baavjood bina kisi tender prakriya ke use hissedaar banaaya gaya tha
 Now Congress has alleged that the Prime Minister's statement that i will not eat or let anyone eat is just a jumla
 congress ke mutabik rajya main modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan gharelu or antarrashtriya shrot kharidne ke dauraan aniyamitata barti gai or sarkari khajaane ke bada nuksaan jhelana padaa he
 The Congress' first question said that the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) bought 80% of the share of this GSPL at a time when gas was not discovered in the KG basin
 is share ko oengisi ne 7,738 karod rupee main kharida tha
 Therefore, the Congress has asked the question why did ONGC buy the shares of GSPL after finding gas in KG basin after 2005? Was this an attempt to hide the losses of GSPL through procurement? The second question of the Congress was that the Congress also alleged that all the directors of GSPL at the time of this deal were placed in large positions by the Central Government at present
 
 congress ke mutabik isamen kendriya rigerv bank ke maujuuda governor urtij patel bhi shaamil hai kyonki jiespiel-oengisi deal ke vakt vah jiespiel ke swatantra nideshak kepad par maujuud the
 Therefore, with the claim of these elements, the Congress said that this whole case shows what is the truth of the Gujarat model being promoted by the Prime Minister
 controlar and auditor general kii report kaa hawala dete hue congress party ne kaha ki jiespiel ke paas kul 64 gas blox the jinamein se 11 oversij gas blox the
 There are irregularities in surrendering these 11 gas blocks
 congress ne siedi report ke hawaale se kaha ki akele in aniyamittaaon se rajya sarkaar ko 1757 karod rupee ke rajasav kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 Also read: Exclusive: Khemka of Gujarat? On August 4, ONGC, the Government of India's Navratna company, bought 80 per cent of the loss-making company for Rs 7,738 crore after the GSPC drowned Rs 20,000 crore, according to several questions on the suspension of the Income Tax Officer
 bijepi kii saficongress dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon par bijepi netaa or kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne safai dete hue kaha ki congress party ne apane 10 saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan desh ko sabase bhrasht sarkaar di thi lihaaja ab vah gujarat chunaavon se pehle bhrashtachar ke bebuniyaad maamle manuphacture kar rahi he
 Jaitley said that in the same way, the Congress party questioned the Rafale deal, while this deal has been done between the government of two countries, so that there is no question of any kind of corruption
 jetali ne kaha ki ab congress jiespisi kaa mudda uthaa rahi he
 On the Congress allegations, Jaitley said that the place where GSPC got the mining contract, while ONGC was also mining
 lekin jab is project main jiespisi ke liye iconomic vibility nahin bachi to ek sarkari company se duusari sarkari company ke paas contcact chalaa gaya
 Therefore, there is no possibility of any doubt in this case and all the allegations made by the Congress are completely baseless

 KPMG (india) partner and head of tax affairs Girish Vanwari said, 'the proposed amendments are progressive and put an end to the uncertainty over fines on deposits in bank accounts after the announcement of demonetisation

 The proposed amended income tax law also provides that the declarers will have to invest 25 percent of their total deposits in the Prime Minister's Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), where no interest will be paid
 saath hi is raashi ko chaar saal tak nahin nikaala ja sakegaa
 He said, 'this amendment seems quite strategic and beneficial for all, because if everything goes well then the tax collection will increase significantly

 ' Ernst and Young India National Tax Leader Sudhir Kapadia said that the bulk of undisclosed cash and bank deposits would fall under the alternative PMGKY

 a shameful incident has come to light in Dehradun
 yahaan ke ek skool main teacher ne kuch aisa kiya he ki insaaniyat bhi sharmasaar ho jaae
 The students are in shock since the incident
 khabar he ki jepi international skool main ek adhyapika ne chaatraon ko nirvastr kar puure skool kaa round lagavaaya
 His only mistake was that his English test had low numbers
 amar ujaalaa main chhapi report ke anusaar, angreji ke test main kam number aane par teen chaatraon ke kapade utaravakar skool parisar main ghumaya gaya
 The students were shocked after this incident
 jab unhone apane ghar jaakar ye baat bataai to unke parijanon ne skool pahunchakar hangaamaa kiya
 Complained to management
 teacher ko kyon aayaa gussadarasal, angreji ke test main teen chaatraon ke number kaaphi kam aae the
 The teacher of English was agitated after checking the test paper
 unhone pehle to teenon chaatraon ko kaksha main bainch par khadaa kiya or phir kapade utaravakar skool parisar main ghumaya
 Co-ed is a school
 You will be surprised to know that this school is co-ed ie both boys and girls study here
 parisar main kapade utaravakar chaatraon ko ghumaane kii khabar skool ke saath-saath kasbe main aag kii tarah fail gai
 The matter reached the police
 Now this matter has reached the police
 sthaneey chaowkee prabharee suresh balondi ne kaha he ki unhen taharir mil gai he
 On the other hand, the Principal of the school, Amita Rathore, says that these allegations are false

 The new Motor Vehicle Act is being opposed in many places in the country

 This strike can have a great impact on the common people
 darasal, hadtaal ke dauraan guuruuvaar ko subah 6 baje se privet cab, auto, bas (skool bas samet), paryatak basen or taxi sevaayen prabhavit hongi
 There is opposition to the new Motor Vehicle Act, but Union Minister Nitin Gadkari believes that the public is getting support
 mangalvaar ko gadakari ne kaha tha ki jo log jurmaane se naakhush the, ve bhi ab sahamat hai
 He said that fines are collected through the states
 1 sitambar se lagu hue nae niyam ke baad desh main kai aise maamle saamne aae hai, jahaan par yatayaat kaa niyam todane par lakhon rupee kaa jurmaana dena padaa he
 Many states have refused to implement the new rule
 isamen bijepi shasit rajya bhi hai
 At the same time there are some states which have implemented the new rule with less penalty
 nae niyam ke tahat seat belt na lagane par jurmaana 1000 rupee kar diya gaya he
 Earlier it was 100 rupees
 red lite jump ke liye pehle jurmaana 1000 rupee tha, ab 5000 rupee dene honge
 There is a provision of 6 months in jail for the first offense and a fine of up to Rs 10,000 for driving a drunk
 jabaki duusari baar ye galati karte hai to 2 saal tak jail or 15,000 rupee tak kaa jurmaana lagegaa
 You will now have to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 instead of Rs 500 for driving without a license
 vahiin, agar koi naaballig gaadi chalaata he to use 10,000 rupee jurmaana dena hoga jo pehle 500 rupee tha
 There was no penalty so far for not giving way to the emergency vehicle, but for not giving way to such a vehicle, a fine of Rs 10,000 will have to be paid
 bina helmet gaadi chalaane par 500 rupee kii bajaae 1000 rupee kaa jurmaana vasula jayega

 11 may se supreme court main shuru hui teen talaak ke mudde par sunwaayee 18 may ko khatm hui thi or court ne apane aadesh ko surakshit rakhaa liya tha
 Not in favor of triple talaq, please tell you that the bench of 5 judges was hearing the issue
 court main yah sunwaayee 6 dinon tak chali
 The Central Government, in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, had made it clear that it does not consider the practice of triple talaq to be valid and in favor of continuing it

 agar ram kaa ayodhya main janm hona, aasthaa kaa vishay ho saktaa he to teen talaak kaa mudda kyon nahin
 The triple talaq should end, Rohatgi argued that if three countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Sudan have abolished laws like divorce, then why can't we
 atarni general mukul rohtagi ne peeth se kaha tha, 'agar adaalat turant talaak ke tareeke ko nirast kar detii he to ham logon ko alag-thalag nahin chodenge
 We will introduce a law for the regulation of marriage and divorce among the Muslim community

 mukhyamantri india today ko bataate hai, “esadf sikkim kii satta main disambar 1994 main ai thi or pehle hi din se mere saare kaarykram sikkim ke logon kii jaruraton or maangon ke hisaab se unke liye chalaae ja rahe hai
 i have met their minimum requirements for infrastructure development
 ab meraa jor unhen gunvatttapurna vikaas dene par he
 “to ensure good governance in the state, Chief Minister Chamling and his team have given special attention to the field of health and education
 sarkari abhiyaan kaich yani comprihensive anual and total health check-ap for healdi sikkim ke madhyam se yah rajya janata ke daravaaje tak swasthya sevaayen pahunchane vaala pehla rajya ban gaya he
 By June 2014, the entire population of the state had been covered under this campaign
 mukhyamantri chamling ne yah abhiyaan 26 agast, 2010 ko is uddeshy ke saath shuru kiya tha ki 2015 tak sikkim ko desh kaa sabase swasth rajya bana diya jayega
 The state government decided to invest 20 percent of its total annual expenditure in the field of education and the result is worth seeing today: in 1993-94 the literacy rate here was 56 percent which has crossed 82 percent today
 ab sarkaar kaa sara jor buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas par he
 Chamling says, “the establishment of a railway network between West Bengal and Sikkim, the establishment of airports in the state and the construction of new highways for heavy vehicles are among our top priorities
 isse yahaan zyada sailaaniyon ko aakarshith karne main madad milegi or rajya main zyada nivesh ho paaegaa
 As a largely dependent state on tourism, Sikkim has consistently received the status of the greenest and "most sustainable" state based on annual assessments from reputed centers and environmental agencies
 mukhyamantri kaa maananaa he ki paryaavaran ko sangrakshit karne ke saamaajik tareeke se behatar or koi tarika nahin ho saktaa
 This initiative has been done to maintain green cover and sanitation in the state through spontaneous participation of the people, which according to them, has been quite extensive and successful in the last few years
 natijatan, sikkim main kul vanakshetra main 3
 There has been an increase of 53 per cent & 44 in 1995
 06 fisadi tha jo 2009 main badhkar 47
 59 percent
 harith cover ke alaava rajya sarkaar yah bhi pannka kar rahi he ki rajya main swatchta ko or majboot kiya ja sake
 In the cleanliness drive launched throughout the state, the government and civic bodies have left no stone unturned to connect the public
 is seemaant rajya ne jaivik kheti ke maamle main bhi agrani sthiti hasil kii he
 Before the merger of Sikkim in India in 1975, there was traditionally organic farming
 ise dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne vidhansabha main 2003 main ek aitihaasik ghoshnaa kii ki rajya ko purnatah jaivik banaaya janaa he
 This was the first such policy initiative in India and Sikkim became the first state to implement it
 ise aupchaarik shakl dete hue 2010 main sikkim organic mishan kii shuruyaat kii gai or is lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye rajyastareey kaaryshaala kaa aayojan bhi kiya gaya
 The completion period for this target is December 2015
 vah bhi aisa hi din hoga jab ek baar phir gangtok ke emji road par janata nae sire se jashn manaane ke liye jute sakegi
 lashkar-e-taiba is preparing a group of 21 women militants in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir training camps
 sena sutron ne yah jaankaree di
 An army officer said, 'we have confirmed reports that lashkar-e-taiba is training 21 women terrorists in its training camps in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan occupied Kashmir to carry out terrorist incidents in India
 ’unhone kaha ki nae gut ko dukhatreen-e-taiyaba naam diya gaya he or lashkar kii yojana is gut ko kashmir ghati main sakriy karne kii he

 unhone kaha ki jammu kashmir main suraksha balon ke haathon kai sheersh aatankwaadiyon ke maare jane se aatankwaadi guton ko baari jhatka laga he
 He said that he also plans to recruit local youths
 aapadaa main fanse logon ke liye fasebuk ne ek behtareen sarvice shuru kii he
 Facebook has created a tool called 'safety Check' which will be helpful in detecting people trapped in the disaster
 is tul kaa istemaal aapadaa ke ilaakon main fanse logon se sampark karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 In fact, it is often seen during the disaster that the communication system in the affected areas deteriorates due to which the friends and loved ones of those trapped in that area are not able to contact them, and in such a situation, to know about their skills They get restless
 fasebuk ne aisi hi paristhiti se nipatane ke liye 'sefti check' tul ko develop kiya he
 How the 'safety Tool' will work This tool can be used on any smartphone and desktop
 fasebuk sabase pehle aapaki profile se aapke ricent lokation kaa pataa lagayegaa or agar aapaki lokation aapadaa se prabhavit he to tunrat aapaki profile par ek notification aayega
 In the notification that says 'are you Safe?' Will have written agar aap sef hai to turant us notification main likhe 'I am safe' par clic kar den
 After this, Facebook will spread the news about your safety to all the people associated with your friendlist
 is tul kii madad se aap apane doston ke sef hone kii jaankaree bhi le sakenge
 This tool has been developed by Japanese Engineers of Facebook
 darasal, japan main ai tsunami ke samay vahaan fanse logon ne fasebuk or duusari soshal netwarking site kii madad se apane doston or rishtedaaron ko apane surakshit hone kii jaankaree pahunchaai thi
 Since then, Facebook started working on such a tool with the help of which people can be detected at the time of disaster
 video kii madad se jaaniye kaise kaam karegaa 'sefti check' Opposition parties have been stirred up after a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke istife dene par ad jane ke bich rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke pramukh lalu prasad yadav ne is kadam ko aatmghaatee bataaya he
 Lalu wrote on his Twitter that offering Rahul's resignation would be a suicidal move
 vipaksh kaa ek hi lakshya tha ki vah bhaajapa ko haraae, lekin usamen vah vifal rahe
 But do not change the actual form of India based on the results of any one election
 ek angreji akhbaar ko lalu yadav ne loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam ke baad intervyuu diya, jisko unhone mangalvaar ko twit kiya
 Lalu Yadav said, 'rahul's resignation from the post of president will be a setback for the parties fighting the fight against the Sangh Parivar, it will be like falling into the trap of BJP
 jaise hi gandhi parivaar se alag koi adhyaksh banegaa, to narendra modi-amit shah use rahul-sonia ke dwaara remote sanchalit adhyaksh bataaenge’
 Rahul's offer to resign suicidal
 Opposition parties had the common goal to dislodge BJP but failed to build a national narrative
 The result in a particular election can never alter the reality in as diverse and plural a country as India

 aise hi jinda khyaalon ke saath hindi ke jane-maane lekhak doctor asagar vajahat buudhvaar kii dopaher dilli vishvavidhyalay ke miranda house main saikadon chaatr chaatraon se rou-ba-rou hue
 On Wednesday, Dr
 asagar vajahat kii pustak 'baakar ganj ke saiyad' kaa locarpan hua
 Renowned Hindi publisher Rajpal & Sons has published this book by Dr
 Asgar Wajahat
 itnaa hi nahin, prakaashak ne dilli vishvavidhyalay main chaatr chaatraon ko doctor vajahat se rou-ba-rou karwaane ke liye unki chaar pustakon ke vimochan kaa kaarykram rakhaa he, jiskaa pehla padaav buudhvaar ko miranda house main yojit kiya gaya
 In a multicultural country like India, there are so many pride stories which are proud to think about
 kaumi taraane ‘saare jahaan se acha’ main ikbaal ne likhaa tha, ‘i aab-e-ruud-e-ganga! wo din he yaad tujko
 Landed on your shore, when the caravan was ours
 ’ mana jaataa he ki doctor asagar vajahat bhi usee silsile ko aage badha rahe hai jo aise hi kisi kaaravaan kii talash main jute hai jisane kabhi hindustan kii sarazmi par kadam rakhaa or yahaan kii ganga-jamani tahazeeb main aakar usee main samaa gaya
 Syed of Bakar Ganj is one stop of this search
 is pustak ko itihaas kaha jaae yaa phir yatra varnan? upanyaas kaha jaae yaa ek sansmaran? is kisse ko reportaj kahen yaa phir aitihaasik reporting? kisi ek daayre main shaamil hokar bhi ye pustak uske baahar khadi nazar aati he
 In this unique journey, the readers are seen taking a tour of the forgotten villages of Awadh and they have kept the finger of history in order to not get lost in the maze of words
 is pustak main itihaas saath saath chalata mahasoos hota he or urdu-farsi kaa gyaan kisi lambii yatra ke dauraan mili thandi chhaanv sa sukun detii he
 But this doctor Asgar Wajahat's pen is amazing, which he has presented in such a comfortable way
 hindi main aisi bahut kam rachanaaen hai jinamein itihaas ne sahitya kii is tarah galabahiyaan kii he or sach kahen ko ye kisi danishmand kaa hunar hi he jisane is mail ko itnaa rochak or dilfareb banaaya he
 The same thing gives a pleasant feeling of riding on the unknown waves of history
 sach to yah he ki kissagoi kaa aisa andaaj asagar vajahat kaa hi dekhne ko mila, jisaki badaulat andekhee ko dikhaane kaa durlabh kaam hota najar aata he

 At the same time, Indrani also called Sheena to her house in Worli, but she refused to come
 *- indrani or sanjeev shina ko lene ke liye bandra neshnal college ke paas gaye
 Sheena was killed in a rented car on the Eastern Express Highway
 waapas varli pahunchakar laash ke saath car parking main park kar di gai
 When Indrani and Sanjeev returned, Mikhail could not be found
 hosh main aane ke baad khatre ko bhaanpate hue vah vahaan se bhaag niklaa
 * - After this Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai took Sheena's body and buried it in the forest of Raigad
 *- shina kii hatya ke baad indrani ne sabko yah bataaya ki vah america main jaakar shaadi kar chuki he
 * - No information was reported by Indrani or family to Sheena's disappearance to the police
 *- shina kii hatya ke teen saal baad tak kuch nahin hua
 One day an unknown call came in Khar police station
 usne bataaya ki ek auto rickshaw driver ne ek badi fimali kii ladki kii hatya kar jangal main dafan kar diya he
 * - After this, the police called the driver Shyam Rai on surveillance
 uske sandigdh gatividhiyon ko dekhte hue police ne use giraftaar kar liya
 What police do we not know? * - Why did Indrani Mukherjee's ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna get involved in the murder of Sheena? * - Why did Peter Mukherjee remain silent even after knowing Indrani Mukherjee's lies? * - What did Mikhail do to silence him? Gone? * - Why did Indrani kill her even after Rahul and Sheena are united? The reason for this was love or money? Read also: How much property was owned by Indrani? What happened in the court on Monday? What happened to Indrani and Sanjeev's call details with Indrani? uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne apane sabhi mantriyon ke gharon ke baahar sisitivi camera lagavane kaa faisla kiya he
 For this, 61 CCTV cameras have also been ordered
 lekin unki is kavayad se mantri khush nahin lag rahe hai
 Ministers believe that this is interfering with their privacy
 jabaki akhilesh kaa daawa he ki aisa mantriyon kii suraksha ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Perhaps the young chief minister has realized that if the law and order in the state is to be maintained, then its ministers will have to keep a close watch

 kyonki emsidi staff ko kai baar log apane gharon main aane nahin dete
