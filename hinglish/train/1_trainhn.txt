 main bhartiya hockey ke liye yogadan dena chahta hum, lekin yah bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga ki koching meraa pesha he
 To come to India, i will have to leave the job in Singapore, so i would like to consider several aspects and take a decision on receiving the proposal
 felics ne haalanki kaha ki jab tak koi peshkash nahin milti, is bare main kuch bhi kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 There is speculation that Roland Oltman of Holland may join the Indian team as head coach, while Felix will be the national coach

 yah poochne par ki kya bhartiya hockey team kii samasyaon kaa hal videshi coach ke paas hi he, felics ne haa main jawaab diya
 He said, foreign coach is a good option, but it will have to be seen whose services are being taken
 oltman bada naam he or achche coach bhi
 It will not be a right decision to appoint anyone in the name of a foreign coach
 coach kaa rasookh bhi dhyaan main rakhana chahie, kyonki bharat kaa pichhlaa anubhav acha nahin rahaa he
 Felix also said that he would not mind working with Oltman if he got the chance

 It has been almost four decades since the debate in India that why should we also make electricity from domestic waste
 jab europe ke desh aisa kar sakate hai to bharat aisa kyo nahin kar saktaa
 But in spite of the government's full support and subsidy in the country, such experiments failed for a long time
 jabaki is bich europe main germany, sweden, norge, belgimyam or netherland jaise deshon main kooday se bijli banane ke 420 se zyada plant na sirf shuru hue balki bijli supplai bhi karne lage
 The situation is that in many countries like Sweden, there is a concern that they do not have enough waste to generate all the electricity they need with just garbage
 in deshon main kai nagar palikaon main is baat par jhagada machaa hua he ki ve apane shahar kaa kooda duusare shahar ko kyon den
 Use of Solapur but lately some cities in India have shown success in this direction
 apane puure kooday ko bijli main badalane or vah bhi paryaavaran ko kisi tarah kaa nuksaan pahunchaae bina- yah kaam maharashtra ke sholapur shahar ne kar dikhaaya he
 This city, with a population of 1 million, generates 5,000 tonnes of garbage daily
 pehle yah kooda pune-hyderabad hive par kareeb 13 acre ke daayre main gandhaata rahata tha
 But now the garbage dump is missing and in the middle the powerhouse of Organic Recycling System (ORS), a power generation company, appears
 nagar nigam ke trek bijlighar ke andar kachra daalkar chale jate hai
 And after that this waste is converted into electricity, organic manure and plastic ready for use in roads
 yahaan se 3 megawatt bijli grid ko supplai kar di jaati he
 This work has been going on successfully for the last three years
 teen saal kaa yah samay mahatvapurn he kyonki isse pehle kooday se bijli banane kii kai pariyojnaayen chaar-chah maheene chalakar band ho chuki hai
 The wonders of indigenous technology but what is it in Solpur that distinguishes it from earlier failed schemes
 is bare main peshey se ejeeniyar or oares ke siemdi suhas bhaand kehete hai, ‘‘isse pehle kii zyaadaatar yojanaayen isliye naakaam raheen kyonki unamem ricyclable or anya tarah ke kachare ko alag-alag karne kii majaburi thi

 The minimum support for kharif crops has been increased by the central government
 sarkaar kii ore se ise bada faisla bataaya ja rahaa he to vahiin kai export ne bhi apni raay rakhi he
 Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist of CRISIL, explained the decision
 unhone kaha ki is saal kharif fasalon kaa nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) fasalon kii vaastavik keemat or kisaan kii mehnat ke formule par 50-97 fisadi adhik nirdhaarit kii gai he or yah pichley saal kii tulana main 4-52 fisadi adhik he
 At the same time, the average MSP increase based on the crop purchased by the government last year is about 13 percent
 yadi yah maan liya jaae ki sarkaar is saal bhi utani hi fasal kharidne ja rahi he jitani pichley saal kharidi gai tab emspi main kii gai vruddhi se kendra sarkaar ke khajaane par 11,500 karod rupee kaa asar padegaa
 However, the real impact of increase in MSP is expected to affect the central government more as this year the government is ready to buy more crops than last year
 vahiin jahaan fasal kii kharid nahin hogi vahaan fasal kii emspi or vaastavik keemat (mandi main keemat) kaa antar kisaan ko dene kaa praavdhaan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 At present, the price in the mandi of most crops is lower than the announced MSP
 swaminathan ne bhi kiya tha swaagatapako bataa den ki isse pehle krishi vaigyanik emes swaminathan ne kharif fasalon kaa nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) badhaakar laagat kaa dedh guna kar die jane ke centre sarkaar ke faisle kaa swaagat kiya he, lekin kaha he ki jo sifarish kii gai thi, yah usase kam he
 Swaminathan welcomed the decision to increase the MSP and said that the government should make proper arrangements for procurement and storage
 unhone kaha, 'sarkaar ne fasal beemaa main sudhaar ke liye kadam uthaae hai, lekin kawarej or parfarmens ko abhi bhi santoshjanak nahin kaha ja saktaa he, or isaki vajah se ucch mulya vruddhi tathaa aasaan karj kii maang kaa jokhim bana hua he
 It is noteworthy that the MSP of paddy has been increased by Rs 200 per quintal, while the MSP of other kharif crops has been increased by up to 52 percent
 sarkaar ke is kadam se khaadya sabsidi kaa boj badhkar do lakh karod rupee ke paar pahunch saktaa he or mudrasphiti badhane ke rup main bhi iskaa asar saamne aa saktaa he

 australia ke ek purv rajanyik ne tark diya he ki bharat ko uranium bechney se phaayde se zyada nuksaan hone vaale hai
 The diplomat argues that although this sale would increase export revenue to some extent, it would signal countries such as Japan and South Korea that Canberra is not serious about accepting the non-proliferation Treaty

" use uranium kii bikri karne vaale australia kii bhi isamen jimmedaari banati he

 Aam Aadmi Party's National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal had questioned the intentions of Congress President Rahul Gandhi regarding the alliance, in response to which Rahul himself now gave the reason for not being an alliance
 saath hi rahul gandhi ne arvind kejariwal ko 2014 kii bhi yaad dilaai
 Addressing a public meeting in Delhi's Chandni Chowk on Monday, Rahul Gandhi targeted the current Chief Minister of Delhi and Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal and said that he should consider who lied about the Congress in 2014 and Opened the door for the BJP
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'kejariwal ko is par vichaar karnaa chahie ki bhaajapa ke liye darwaja kisne kholaa (party ko asar badhaane kaa mauka kisne diya), congress ke bare main jhooth kisne bolaa? yah akele bhaajapa ne nahin kiya tha'
 Rahul Gandhi also told Kejriwal on the alliance, the reason for Congress not being aligned with Aam Aadmi Party
 rahul ne kaha, 'maine unase (kejariwal se) kaha ki hamen dilli kii sabhi saaton seat jeetni chahie
 i told them that you will fight on four seats, Congress will fight on three

 As soon as i approved it, they raised the talk of Haryana and Punjab

 Appealing to vote for Congress candidate Jai Prakash Aggarwal from Chandni Chowk, Rahul Gandhi asked people to think about which party is giving a tough challenge to the BJP across the country
 rahul ne kaha, 'jahaan kahin bhi modi gaye, hamane, congress ne, har jagah unka muqabla kiya
 We beat them in many states
 agar bharat main koi party bhaajapa ko roak sakati he to vah congress he
 It is a battle of ideologies

 However, Arvind Kejriwal is claiming that only the Aam Aadmi Party can defeat the BJP in Delhi

 At the same time, Kejriwal questioned Rahul's intention to not have an alliance

 Despite this, the statement of his predecessor will continue to resonate further in this controversy, which is full of possibilities to keep going in the links that do not end till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections

 unhone kaha, "reliance antertenment ne nombar van se judi kisi bhi film ke liye kabhi koi bhugtan nahin kiya he
 Reliance Entertainment gave Visiverse Capital 14 on December 5, 2017, about two weeks before the film's release on December 20, 2017

 In the board being set for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it is clear that the Rafale deal of the French fighter plane will be the main electoral weapon of the Congress party to target the BJP

 Out of 282 BJP members of BJP, there are 98 mps against whom criminal cases are going on, but Modi ji's CBI and Income Tax Department did nothing

 There are cases against 34 per cent of the BJP members, but Modi ji's branches do not take any action, they are only taking action against the Aam Aadmi Party

 Only a few of them are listed in the stock market, so where do the rest of the big private companies get money for business? Obviously from the bank! As a debt! So, if not directly or indirectly in the business of the bank depositor company, when every work in the country is to be done by the bank's debt and the savings are actually being distributed (or robbed) of millions of people So why shouldn't bank depositors get the same attention or information that the shareholders of the company get? No matter whether the owner of the company is one or many, the difference should be that it Coming from where capital traded? Dependent credibility of banking in India on all these questions, why?

 What is the treatment? New rules of transparency should be set for the bank lending businesses

 After splitting the two parliamentary constituencies of Patna district into Patna Sahib and Pataliputra, this Lok Sabha constituency, which came into existence once again, is seen as 'star Wars'
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) tathaa congress ke liye patna sahib seat pratishtha kaa sawaal ban gai he
 The importance of this seat has also increased because as an actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha is in the fray from here, the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) alliance have fielded Bhojpuri film actor Kunal Singh
 vaise is seat se janata dal (united) ne prakhyat chikitsak gopal prasad sinha ko chunavi samar main utaar diya he, jabaki aam aadmi party (aap) ne bihar kii purv mantri parveen amanullah ko khadaa kar muqabla dilachasp bana diya he
 All the candidates are campaigning heavily on this seat which has become famous since Star Wars
 shatrughna sinha ke prachaar main unki patni punam sinha or unke bete bhi utar chuke hai, vahiin kunal apni patni ke saath chunaav prachaar kii kaman khud sanbhale hue hai
 Though 19 candidates are trying their luck from Patna Sahib, but political experts believe that this seat is mainly 'star Wars'
 varsh 2009 se astitv main ai patna sahib seat pichley chunaav main bhi shatrughna sinha or televijan ke mashhoor kalakaar shekhar suman ke bich mukaable kii vajah se charchit hui thi
 The constituencies of Bakhtiyarpur, Digha, Bankipur, Kumhara, Patna Sahib and Fatuha assembly constituencies are included in this constituency
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main in chah vidhansabha kshetron main se chaar par jad (you) bijepi gathbandhan ne kabja kiya tha
 During the election campaign, Shatrughan Sinha said that we have received the blessings of the people
 ham chaahate hai ki aashirwad bana rahe or modi, jo bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar hai, vah pradhanmantri bane
 At the same time, Congress candidate Kunal says that in this election people are in a mood to 'silence' actor Sinha
 udhar, chunavi prachaar main lageen parveen amanullah bhi apni jeet kaa daawa karte hue gali-gali gum rahi hai
 She says that my path has become easier with two film actors coming into the election fray
 abhinayta na logon ke bich jate hai or na unki samasya sunate hai
 However, in the Patna Sahib constituency with star candidates, the star as well as the leader are also in the election fray
 aise main sthaneey matadaata kiskaa saath denge, yah to chunaav parinaam aane ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 People are eagerly waiting for the election to be held on 17 April

 Pakistani-origin terrorist David Headley has said that the lashkar-e-taiba wanted to call the Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray to the US so that his inflammatory remarks could benefit the ISI but Thackeray's assassination was never planned
 bharat main shivasena ko ek prabhavi sanghathan qaraar dete hue hedli ne kaha ki thakare kii hatya karnaa ek bevakoofi bharaa kadam hota or aisa karnaa sone kaa anda dene vaali murgi ko maarane jaisaa hota
 In fact, Headley joked about Thackeray's murder during Lashkar's interaction with his teammates
 pakistani mul ke ek anya sandigdh aatankwaadi tahawwur hossain rana ke khilaaf sunwaayee ke dauraan hedli se vakil ne poocha, kya logon kii hatya ke bare main lashkar ke log majaak karte hai? is sawaal ke jawaab main hedli ne kaha, haa
 Lashkar people do this
 ve logon kii hatya karte hai or is bare main majaak bhi karte hai
 Headley was quoted as referring to the conspiracy to assassinate Thackeray while questioning in reference to his alleged friendship with Raja reggae of Shiv Sena
 bakaul hedli shivasena pramukh ko america bulaane kii sajeesh rachi gai thi
 The lawyer asked Headley if he had planned to call Thackeray to America thinking that if he would say something inflammatory, the ISI would benefit from it
 Headley answered yes
 hedli ne kaha ki thakare ke bayaan kaa video kaa istemaal iesai yah kahkar karti ki america aatankwaadiyon kii mehmaannawaaji kar rahaa he
 The lawyer asked, when you were trying so hard to bring this man to this place, don't you kill him? Headley said, no, even if i wanted to do it, it would have been a foolish step to do it
 kisi ko dhan kharch karke yahaan laayaa jaae or phir use maar diya jaae, yah kadam thik bevakoofi bharaa hota

 The rupee continues to fall against the dollar
 somvaar korupayaekdollarake mukaable 72
 Had reached the level of 67
 mangalvaar kii baat karen, to aaj bhi rupaya 72 ke paar khulaa he
 The central government is now planning to sell NRI bonds to handle the falling rupee
 somvaar ko vitt mantralay ke do adhikariyon ne is taraf ishaara kiya
 He indicated that the government could bring in NRI bonds and deposit schemes to support the rupee
 kya hote hai NRI bonds?apravasi bonds athwa enarai bonds videshi mudra jamaa hoti he
 These deposits are made through nris living abroad
 in diposits ke badale unhen gharelu str se zyada byaaj diya jaataa he
 Most of the time there is a lock-in period of 3 to 5 years for these deposits
 yahi nahin, in diposits par arabiai kii guarantee bhi hoti he
 It is not clear yet, however, the government has not given any clear information about nribonds
 sarkaar ne abhi ye nahin bataaya he ki vah agar enarai bonds laati he, to uske liye kya niyam va sharten hongi
 nris give such support but in the past also NRI bonds have been resorted to
 centre sarkaar ne 2013 main enarai bond skim laai thi
 Meanwhile, Indian banks operating abroad encouraged nris to deposit their dollars
 apravasi bharatiyon kii taraf se diposit kiye gaye dollar ko bhartiya shakhaon main bank bhej dete hai
 This supports the falling rupee
 nris ko kya miltaa he?jab bhi koi apravasi bhartiya gharelubankki videshi shakha main dollar jamaa karata he
 So instead he is given more interest from domestic level
 iske saath hi ve desh main apnedollarako rupee main canwart karne kaa mauka bhi pate hai
 However, most such schemes have a lock-in period of 3 to 5 years
 iskaa matlab he ki itane saalon tak ve diposits viddraow nahin kar paaenge

 He made a statement regarding the alleged shooting of two Indian fishermen on the Italian oil tanker by security forces on the coast of Kerala

 In the interview, Eleanchery had said, "I am in touch with the Catholic ministers of Kerala and will stay

 unhone mujhe adhiktam prayaas kaa aashwaasan diya he
 The agency was quoted as saying by Eleanchery, "I received information about the death of the Catholic fishermen
" yah behad dukhad he
 i immediately contacted the Catholic ministers of Kerala and asked them not to take any action in haste
 is maamlen main haalanki kuch galtiyaan bhi huin
 The fishermen were deemed to be pirates, but the case here is different

 cor ne iske jawaab main unase kaha ki donon par bhartiya kanoon ke tahat mukadmaa chalegaa
 Kaur told the media, 'they have their own interpretations in terms of law and our own

 After the announcement of Eleanchery, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India (CBCI) and the syro-malabar Church issued a hasty statement saying that the cardinal's talk had been distorted
 siro-malabar carch ke pravaktaa fadar paul thelakat ne tafasil se bataaya, ‘cardinal ne sirf itnaa kaha tha ki bharat or italy ke paraspar sambandhon ko bigaade bagaiyr is maamle ko sulajhaa liya janaa chahie
 After all, how can they say that the poor fishermen killed were also Catholic? But the damage is done
 thelakat ke mutabik cardinal shantipurna tareeke se iskaa nibatara chaahate the kyonki unhen andeshaa tha ki is ghatana kaa asar italy main rahane or kaam karne vaale bharatiyon par kaisaa padegaa
 He told, 'the cardinal told me that he did not talk to any minister on this issue, nor did he intend to put any hurdle in the legal process

 i do not want to comment
 chunki siro-malabar carch ne khud kaha he ki cardinal kii tippanee ko tod-marod kar pesh kiya gaya, lihaaja koi bhi tippanee karne kii jarurat nahin he

 He cast a vote at the City Montessori College booth

 bhale koi gathbandhan ummidavaar ho, magar iviem par usee party kaa chunaav chinh hota he, jis party ne tikat diya ho yaa phir jiske simbel se vah vyakti namakan kiya ho
 This time due to the alliance in Lucknow, the BSP candidate is not in the fray
 is liye iviem main basapa kaa chunaav chihn nahin rahaa
 In such a situation, in front of Mayawati, there was a compulsion to cast a vote on another symbol instead of elephant
 naakhush hampradhanmantri manmohan singh
 Unhappy therefore some ministers are taking decisions without asking them
 taaja maamla he raksha mantri eke antni kaa, jinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki unhone bagaiyrpiem se puche helicopter dealradd karne par karrwai shuru kar di
 Manmohan Singh is on the pm's chair like this, but it is clear that seal seal is being attached to some other address
 or is safagoi ne pradhanmantri ko naakush kar diya he
 The prime minister's most recent displeasure is with government's number two and Defense Minister AK Antony
 helicopter par hue hangaame main kab kya kaise ho gaya pradhanmantri ko pataa hi nahin chalaa sivaae iske ki sibiai kii jaanch ho rahi he
 Sources reveal that the Prime Minister was deeply shocked when he canceled the Italian helicopter deal and came to know from the media
 takalif ye ki pradhanmantri kuch nahin bol sake
 Those keeping news of the internal politics of the Congress say that Antony Sirp takes orders from 10 Janpath
 scindia se naakhush piem?pradhanmantri in dinon grih mantri susheel kumaar scindia se bhi naakush hai
 Afzal Guru's execution of the attack on Parliament and news of the speed post case reached him by ordinary post
 sutron ke mutabik manmohan singh ko pataa hi nahin tha ki afzal guru ke gharavaalon ko khabar di gai yaa nahin, di gai he to kaise or unhen khabar mili bhi he yaa nahin
 The PM came to know when his family members raged, Omar Abdullah became active and minority organizations of the country started cursing the Congress
 pradhanmantri apane hi cabinet ke kaate hue hai
 And feel so disconnected that speaking seems futile
 salmaan khurshid se naakhush piem?manmohan singh kii naakushi kii teesri vajah hai videsh mantri salmaan kurshid
 Salman Khurshid's law may boost the Foreign Minister, which may result in happiness, but the Prime Minister feels himself persecuted by them
 sainik ke sirkalam vaale maamle main salmaan bol gaye the ki pakistan se baatcheet chalati rahegi
 On such a delicate matter, even a soft Prime Minister like Manmohan Singh was beheaded by the softness of his minister
 unhone salmaan kurshid ko kya kaha tha ye to nahin pataa lekin ye pataa he ki agle din salmaan khurshid ne press conference karke pakistan ko bahut burabhala kaha tha
 The Prime Minister has received this displeasure with a boon in the chair
 lekin is vardaan kaa boj ab unase bardaasht nahin ho rahaa
 But his trouble is that he cannot just say that he can bear
 or aisa kabatak chalata rahegaa unhen nahin maaloom

 When asked about some experts' habit of comparing these two cricketers, Gavaskar was not impressed at all
 naaraaz dikh rahe gavaskar ne ‘aaj tak’ se kaha, ‘kapil dev se kisi kii tulana nahin kii jaani chahie
 He is not a once-born player in a generation, but a cricketer born once in a hundred years such as Sir Don Bradman and Sachin Tendulkar

 Gavaskar is also unhappy with the attitude of opener Shikhar Dhawan in the long format

 Gavaskar said, 'shikhar does not want to change his game at all
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘uskaa vishwaas usee tarah se khilne main hai, jisane use ab tak safalataa dilaai he
 You can survive despite playing such shots in ODI cricket, because there is not a lot of slip and by taking the edge of the bat the ball can go from the slip area to the boundary
 ’gavaskar ne kaha, ‘lekin test main, is tarah ke shot kaa nateeja sirf wicket ganvaana hoga
 Unless the player mentally changes, he will have to fight against the red ball abroad
 ’unhone kaha, ‘main (cheteshwar) pujaara ke rup main lords main ek or ballebaaj ko khilaaungaa
 He has the technique and patience required for a Test match
 vah kiski jagah legaa yah pich par nirbhar karegaa
 If there is not so much grass on the wicket, then i would choose him in place of Umesh Yadav and retain Hardik Pandya in the team

 He condemned the verdict in his own style and called it a conspiracy against himself
 unhone kaha tha ki jab sani leyoni or bipasha ne condom kii aid kii, tab sarkaar ne koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 Rakhi Sawant wants to support condoms by becoming a nun, Sophia Hayat said, "if TV channels follow the government's instructions, then everyone in India will get AIDS
" bachche so jaaenge or unhen pataa nahin chalegaa ki condom kya he or iskaa kya istemaal he
 When children do not see this ed, how will they take precaution? agar ye tivi ke liye sahi nahin he to ise edit yaa sensor kar diya jaae

 or chayankartaaon kaa focus aakhir kis ore he? After all, why did the selectors ignore such a player while talking about the future and why he turned back and turned to the old players

 Suresh Raina has been out of the Indian team for one and a half years
 
 And Ashish Nehra is also making a comeback after the T20 World Cup

 Significantly, Yuvraj has not played any ODI for 3 years since December 2013, so he has been out of the T20 team since the World Cup, the reason for his return to the team was told in the performance in the domestic Ranji Trophy
 Then is Karun Nair's international performance not worth it
 vahiin suresh raina dedh saal se bhartiya team se baahar rahe hai
 
 or ashish nehra bhi tii20 world cap ke baad vaapasi kar rahe hai
 The big question is if the selectors are eyeing the ICC Champions Trophy
 
 So do we really have the hopes of winning these players who are included in the team before the big tournament
 
 Then what will happen to the youth who are constantly making a splash in domestic cricket
 
 
 bada sawaal yah ki agar chayankartaaon kii nazar ICC champions trophy par he

 Asked if he was firm on the statement that he consumed poison, Yadav said that this was wrong
 maine yah nahin kaha tha ki main jehar khaauungounhone kaha 'maine sucraat kaa zikr kiya tha jinhone swechha se jehar nahin khaaya tha balki sach bolne ke liye unhen jabaran jehar khilaayaa gaya tha
 i believe in struggle and have been struggling constantly
 main to bhukh hadtaal ke bhi khilaaf hum phir main aatmahatya karne kii baat kaise kar saktaa hum
 Yadav told reporters here that we are against the passage of the bill in its present form
 jo adhik kamjor hai unka shashaktikaran pehle hona chahie
 In its current form, the Bill will empower only those women who are already powerful
 unhone kaha 'ham mahilaon kaa shashaktikaran chaahate hai
 That is why we are not opposed to women's reservation in the Indian legislature
 lekin ham sarkaar ko anusuchit jati anusuchit janajati or anya pichde varg alpsankhyak or kisaan samudaay kii mahilaon ke hiton kii andekhi nahin karne denge
 Referring to 50 percent reservation for women in Bihar's local bodies, Yadav demanded that the Bihar formula should also be adopted at the center level to ensure representation to women belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Minorities and Farmers
 
 unhone mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko aam sahmati ke bina samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye paarit karaane ke prayaas kii bhi aalochana kii
 Yadav said so far 80 constitution amendments have been done but none were done without consensus
 yah pehla vidheyak he jisamen sarkaar kii ore se aam sahmati kaayam karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya ja rahaa
 He did not give a direct answer to these questions whether JD-U will seek support from other parties opposing the bill, SP and RJD
 yadav ne is sawaal kaa jawaab dene se bhi inkaar kar diya ki kya unki party sambandhit raajnneetik dalon main mahilaon ko aarakshan dene ke em es gil ke formule par sahamat hogi
 Asked whether his ally BJP in the NDA has supported the bill, he said that we are together but we have had differences over the issue for the last 13 years
 bhrashtachar ke mudde par hamaari bhaajapa se sahmati he lekin ham vidhyika main mahilaon ke aarakshan tathaa dalit muslim or dalit isaayiyon ko aarakshan ke mudde par unase alag raay rakhte hai
 Sharad Yadav hoped that the government would try to build a consensus on the Women's Reservation Bill
 unhone kaha ki vah loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar kii baat kaa yakeen karte hai ki vidheyak ko sabhi raajnneetik dalon ke saath salaah mashvire ke baad hi loksabhaa main pesh kiya jayega
 Asked if JDU is opposing the bill only with the intention of opposing it as the government has a majority to pass this bill, Yadav said if we do not have a majority, will we leave Parliament
 hamaari sankhya itani bhi kam nahin he
 Yadav said that reservation should be 33 not 50 percent, but not except for the reality
 jamini hakeekat kaa samavesh kar hi aarakshan kii vyavastha honi chahie
 He said that special attention should be paid to women belonging to weaker sections in a country where women from weaker sections suffer more
 yadav ne kaha ki raajnneetik kaaryakarta kisi vishvavidhyalay main taiyaar nahin hota
 The farm is ready to work in the barn, among the farmers, with the laborers, living with the oppressed class
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya raajnneeti main jati hakeekat he
 In this election, the parties distributed tickets on seeing caste and go sweetly in Parliament
 yadav ne kaha ki mahila aarakshan bhartiya samaaj kaa aainaa hona chahie
 There should be a wider debate about this
 ham kisi aarakshan ke chalate nahin aaye

 Earlier in Thakurnagar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched a scathing attack on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and accused her of plotting violence against BJP workers
 unhone daawa kiya ki vah (mamata) unki party ko mili logon ke pyaar ke kaaran ghabara gai he
 Playing the bugle for the Lok Sabha elections in Banerjee's stronghold, Modi also accused his political rivals of misleading the troubled farming community through farm loan waiver
 pradhanmantri ne naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak kaa bhi zikr kiya jisamen pakistan, afghanistan or bangladesh ke un gaiyr muslim alpsankhyakon ko naagarikta dene kii maang kii gai he jo dharmik utpeedan ke kaaran apane desh se bhaag gaye the
 Addressing the program of Scheduled Caste Matua community, Modi said, "now i can understand why Didi (banerjee) and her party are involved in violence, killing innocent people
" vah hamaare liye aapke pyaar se ghabara gai hai
 Describing the budget presented on Friday as a "historic step" for the welfare of farmers, working and middle class, he said that these classes were ignored for years after independence
 unhone kaha, 'hamane apane bajet main kadamon kii ghoshnaa kii he jisase 12 karod chote kisaanon, 30-40 karod kamgaaron or teen karod madhyam vargeey logon ko phayda milegaa
 Modi had to finish the speech in 14 minutes when a stampede-like situation arose in the rally
 raily se pehle pradhanmantri matua thakurbari gaye or samudaay kii netaa or matua mahasang ke sansthaapak harishchandra thakur kii vidhwaa baaro maa kaa aashirwad liya
 PM Modi further said that West Bengal is the only state where the education of children is also being taxed
 yahaan kaa baccha baccha jaanata he tripal tii tex ke bare main
 No one was born to raise a voice against this Triple T
 aapako bataa dete hai ki bengal badlaav karke rahegaa
 PM Modi further said that till now in the history of independent India, no major plan has been made for farmers by the 'PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana'
 is yojana par ek saal main 75 hazaar karod rupye ke kharch kaa anumaan he
 10 years ago, the Congress government claimed that it had waived farmers' debt of Rs 52,000 crore
 itane paise se ham bhi karzmaafee kaa shor machaa sakate the, lekin hamaari niyat saaf he jiskaa parinaam kisaan hit main ai ye permanent yojana he
 The most powerful family of the country is also circling the courts in cases of tax evasion and fraud
 jo log paise lekar duusare desh bhaag gaye the
 They are also being brought back
 jo ek duusare kaa cheharaa dekhnaa pasand nahin karte the, jo cheekh-cheekh kar ek duusare ko jail bhejne kii baat karte the
 Today they are hugging
 main aapako pashchim bengal kaa ek or udhaaharan detaa hum
 The Central government enacted the RERA Act to control real estate but the West Bengal government refused to accept it
 mujhe jo pani pi pikar kosa jaataa he, gaaliyaan di jaati hai
 The only reason for this is that i raise my voice against corruption
 alam ye he ki jaanch agenciyon tak ko pashchim bengal main ghusane se roka jaataa tha
 i too used to sit in Gujarat for 9–9 hours but we never insulted any agency
 main vishwaas dilaataa hum ki pashchim bengal ko nijaat dilaane ke liye din raat kaam kar rahaa hum
 Thank you all for coming in such huge numbers

 kya aapako lagata he ki aapaki or unki dosti kaa samay puraa ho chukaa he, or ab aap donon ke bich ek aise rishte ko saans milani chahie, jise log pyaar kaa naam dete hai, to janaab iske liye mehnat aapako hi kerani hogi or apane saathi ko yah ahsaas karana hoga ki aap hi hai unke sapanom ke rajkumaar
 
 
 Avoid advertising your relationship, according to Expert Payal Puri, never promote yourself among friends
 aap pehle se hi apane saathi ke saath kaa puraa anand uthaa rahe hai, to dusron se khud ko juda hi rakhen
 Artificialness can be harmful to your relationship
 unhen bataaen ki kis tarah aap unke eks se behatar hai or aap donon main bahut si baaten kaaman bhi hai
 Stay apart, saying that your friend is too busy with other friends, then you have to take care that you have something different for them
 aapkaa saath unhen dosti ke saath-saath romaanch bhi de
 Therefore, there is a need to move away from the level of other friends to create their own separate place ', says the sechologist
 manoj kaa
 Anyway, women believe more in love through friendship than men
 isliye is raste ko apane haath se jane na den or apni dost ke man main apane lien bana len apane liye khaas jagah
 Give time to your relationship Now the time has come to cut the amount of time you used to spend with them earlier
 jab aapkaa saath unhen khalegaa, to vah aapke rishte ke bich aae is antaraal main vah aapke liye pyaar ko mahasoos karengi
 Beti, according to Tahi Bisar Depayal Puri, if your friend with whom you want to give a new look to your relationship, knows about your previous relationship, she will also know to this extent your bad behavior with an old partner
 Is, then it is like a hit wicket before you start batting
 isliye sabase pehla kaam karen ki un ke man main aapaki jo buree chhavi ban gai he, use mitaaen or apni ek nai chhavi unke saamne rakhen
 Give them valid reasons for their bad behavior and tell that you are not really so bad
 us samay kii sthitiyon ke bare main unhen bataaen or samajhane kii koshish karen ki aap vastav main aise nahin hai
 Wake up for yourself, now is your chance to air the changes happening within you
 taaki vah aapke liye man main lalak ko paidaa hone se khud ko roak hi na paaen
 Talk to them about the qualities that you like and are among a girl
 bina majaak kare unhen date par chalane ke liye kahen
 Do not be afraid, she will not end your friendship with you, but instead you will start looking at your own heart
 or phir aap chaahate hi kya hai
 Give them a chance to do something too
 If you have done your best and have not got any response, then do not be restless
 ab halaat ko un par chod den
 Don't tell them the condition of your mind which you were keeping in front of them till now
 par haa, unke liye kuch khaas or khushi dene vaale kaam karte rahen
 Slowly she will bend towards you
 dur karen duvidhaon kodow
 According to Deshpandeya, now is the time to clear all the hidden thoughts and dilemmas of the mind
 unhen kahin dinar par le jaaen or apane haathon ke sparsh ke saath unase man kii baat puuchhen
 Yes, keep your hands under control
 kahin aisa na ho ki sneh kaa sparsh ashleelata main badal jaaen
 Then see how your two lives turn into love

 The 56-inch chest failed

 co / oqtdafndeb NC leader Omar Abdullah said that it is 'very embarrassing' for Modi (PM Modi) to kneel in front of anti-india forces
 umr abdulla ne kaha, 'balakot or uri piem modi dwaara rashtriya suraksha ke maamle sanbhaalane ke pratik nahin hai, balki jammu-kashmir he
 
 
 And see what kind of misconduct they have established there
 bharat virdohi takaton ke saamne ekadam se ghutana tech dena sharmnaak he'
 The former chief minister said that for the first time since 1996, assembly elections in the state were not being held on time
 First time since 1996 Assembly elections in J&K are not being held on time
 Remember this next time you are praising PM Modi for his strong leadership
 duusari taraf, jammu-kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri or pidipi adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti ne kaha, ‘jammu kashmir main keval loksabhaa chunaav karaane kaa faisla bharat sarkaar kii kutil soch he'
 He tweeted, 'not letting the people choose the government is against the principle of democracy'
 congress kii jammu-kashmir ikai ne bhi ravivaar ko aarope lagaaya ki centre dwaara halaat ko thik tareeke se nahin sambhaal paane ke kaaran rajya main vidhansabha chunaav taal die gaye hai
 State Congress President GA Mir said in a statement that the big claims made by the Center regarding the situation have been exposed
 centre ne khud hi maan liya he ki halaat kaabo ke baahar hai or maahaul ek saath chunaav karaane laayak nahin he
 Mir said the Center had a golden opportunity to give the people an elected government by holding assembly elections, as all political parties were in favor of holding elections simultaneously
 Decision to hold only Parliamentary elections in J&K confirms sinister designs of goi
 Not letting people elect a government is antithetical to the very idea of democracy
 Also a tactic of buying time to disempower people by pushing an agenda that suits their ulterior motives
 On the other hand, Farooq Abdullah has also questioned the decision not to hold assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir along with Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha, agar loksabhaa chunaav ke liye maahaul anukool he, to phir vidhansabha chunaav ke liye kyon nahin? basapa supremeo mayawati (mayawati) ne bhi loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath jammu-kashmir kaa chunaav na karaane par bhi centre sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Mayawati said, "not having assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir with Lok Sabha elections is a sign of failure of Shri Modi's (PM Modi) government's Kashmir policy
 jo suraksha bal loksabhaa chunaav kara sakate hai vahi usee din vahaan vidhansabha kaa chunaav kyon nahin kara sakate hai? kendra kaa tark betuka he va bijepi kaa bahaanaa bachakaana he''
 Denying J&K assembly's simultaneous poll with the Lok Sabha is poor reflection & indicative of Modi Govt's failure of Kashmir policy
 Forces are surely capable of holding poll for both on the same day much to relief of people
 The center's logic is poor & bjp's excuse is childish

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the upcoming Election Special News Letter swine flu se sahame desh ko badhate taapmaana or temi flu ke chalate raahat mili hi thi ki desh ke saamne ekanaya sankat aa khadaa hua
 Suddenly news of people falling ill together came from every corner of the country
 daftaron main avkaash ke liye aae prarthana patr to yahi kehete hai
 The victims became so incapacitated that it was no longer possible to complete everyday tasks
 is nai beemaari kaa janm kab or kahaan hua ye nishchit taur par to nahin pataa, lekin is beemaari ke janm ke samay ke bare main visheshgyon main matbhed jarur he
 Many say it started when India was decided against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals of Cricket World Cup
 jabaki kai tab bataate hai jis din bharat ne bangladesh ko haraa diya tha
 Regardless of the differences, both factions of experts agree that the disease has taken a formidable form as soon as Bangladesh departs from the World Cup
 semi flu se grast rogiyon ke jo lakshan bataae jate hai, unamem pramukh hai kaam main man na laganaa, australia ke naam se sir main dard hona, news channels par cricket aadhaarit reports baar-baar dekhnaa, pichley maches kii hilites dekh mand-mand muskuraana, kisi anya peedit ke saath baar-baar aankadon or sambhaavnaaon par charchaa karnaa or you-tub par baar-baar mauka-mauka vaala nayaa aid dekhnaa
 As mentioned earlier, after suffering from this disease, the victim is not able to complete the daily work
 is dharna ko or bal yah tathy detaa he ki kai karmchaariyon ne kaarysthal se hafton pehle avkaash maangana shuru kar diya
 In the last two-four days, the figure is increasing further
 yahi haal skool-college or us har sthaan yaa sanstha par he, jahaan kaam ke dinon main upasthiti anivaary he
 This clearly shows that as the disease progresses, the efficiency also decreases
 visheshgy bataate hai ki chhbbees march, jis din semi flu kaa prakope sabase adhik hoga us din peedit is laayak bhi nahi rah jaaenge ki khud uthakar ek gilaas pani pi len
 When we wanted to know by going to a nearby office, we came to know that Gupta, who had not taken a single leave for three years, is also preparing to sit at home due to this disease
 yahi haal prasad or verma ji kaa bhi he
 An employee found on the spot told that perhaps everyone already knows when to fall ill? Today, more applications have been received from people in the office
 chunki abhi sirf is beemaari ke lakshan khoje gaye hai or ilaaj nahin mil paaya he isliye doctors ne saaf kar diya he ki peediton ko chhbbees march ko ghar par rahane diya jaae
 Due to waking up at seven in the morning, tea should be given even if you do not brush
 sakaaratmak maahaul main rog kaa nidaan sheeghra sambhav ho paaegaa
 Take care of food and drink
 unhen pani zyada na diya jaae taaki match ke bich main baar-baar uthanaa na pade
 Do not take the remote from the hand of the person suffering from semi-flu, keep an inverter or radio for emergency
 ye poochne par ki ‘australia ke haarane par yadi bharat final main pahunch gaya to kya ye beemaari lautakar to nahin aegi?’ doctors kaa kahana tha 'nahi! tab koi biimaar nahin padegaa, us din to khud hi ravivaar he!!' The impact of the Janata government's experience on Atal was that he insisted on the incorporation of Gandhian socialism and positive secularism into the principles of the new party BJP formed in 1980
 haalanki jis vakt apane puraane avatar, jansangh ke vipareet yah adhik udaaravaadi rukh akhriyaar kar rahi thi, us vakt sattadhari congress teji se hindu party banati ja rahi thi!indira gandhi ke duusare kaarykaal (1980-84) ke dauraan assam, punjab or kashmir samasya ne sir uthaanaa shuru kar diya
 Indira's sharp statements (the minority did not like) and her clear-cut, emphatic publicity of her passing to temples and religious gurus presented a picture of a Hindu leader
 is prakaar, bhoomikaayen badal gai thim, atal ke netritvvali bijepi udaaravaadi rukh le rahi thi, jabaki indira ke netritvvali congress rajnatik muddon par dakshinpanthi rasta apana rahi thi
 Atal felt that the ghost of the Jana Sangh had not descended from the BJP and would have to run away, whether by calling the Janata Party's manifesto as its own or through statements made by the liberal and weighed
 atal ayodhya andolan ko lekar sahaj nahin the or nijee baatcheet main ve apana virodh vyakt kar dete the, lekin saarvajanik taur par party ke saath khadey dikhte the
 His methods of protest were unique
 jab yah kaha gaya ki ve loksabhaa main party ke netaa ban jaaen, taaki adwani se unka boj utar sake (kyonki ve ayodhya andolan kii aguwai kar rahe the), tab atal ne inkaar kar diya
 Perhaps he had realized what was going to happen in Ayodhya on 6 December 1992 and due to this he stayed away from that holy city
 jab vivaadit dhaanche ko giraaya gaya, tab unhone kaha tha ki vah unke jivan kaa sabase dukhad din tha
 He went on to say, "I am ready to ask those car servants who were a handful and they will accept that they have demolished that structure and will face punishment
" main yah bhi kahana chahta hum ki aise car sevakon kii bhi badi sankhya thi, jo vidhwans main shaamil nahin the
 If the intention was to do it quietly, then the car service would not be required for this plan
 phir bhi, jo kuch vahaan hua, uskaa hamen afsos he
 After Atal's riots and the manner in which the Gujarat state administration dealt with it, Atal's troublesome days began
 atal sarkaar par bijepi shashanwale gujarat sarkaar main parivartan ke liye jis prakaar rashtriya or antarrashtriya dabaav banaaya ja rahaa tha, usase atal ko baari sharmindagi kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 He decided to remove the chief minister; But this was not possible due to pressure from party hardliners led by Advani
 atal ko peeche hatana padaa
 However, Atal succeeded in striking a fine balance in the Ayodhya case
 yah ek taraf sangh parivaar or duusari taraf endie ke ghatak dalon ke dabaav ke baavjood sambhav ho sakaa
 He said in Parliament, "I never sought to build a Ram temple at the site of the disputed structure
 ''ayodhya andolan kaa charam bindu tak pahunchnaa adwani ke liye gaurav kaa pal tha
 It seemed as if he was in an impenetrable position and Atal had been left far behind
 bhagava party main aise logon kii kami nahin thi, jinhen lagata tha ki narsimha raav kii sarkaar kaa girnaa or adwani ke netritv vaali sarkaar kaa satta main aana bas vakt kii hi baat thi
 "advaniji realized that it was not possible for him to stay and before anyone could say anything, he handed over the responsibility to Atalji," says Jagdish Shetiger, who was then the convenor of the party's economic cell and national Was a member of the executive
 is kaaran ayodhya andolan (bhale hi iske kaaran atal ko kinare kiya gaya) aakhirkaar unke haq main rahaa or unhen phir se mukhya bhoomika main le aayaa
 Two months after the nuclear tests that brought India among nuclear-armed countries, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee gave "india Today" an interview on nuclear testing
 "chunaavon main logon se kiye vaade ko nibhaane ke liye hamane silsilewar parmaanu pareekshan kiye
 It is a part of the national agenda of governance
 main pichley chaar dashakon se bharat ko parmaanu shakti se sampann desh banane kii vakaalat karata rahaa hum
 My party has been making this demand consistently and with full force
 ab chunki ham sarkaar main hai, isliye log lambey samay se jataai ja rahi patibaddhta ko karrwai main badalte dekhnaa chaahate hai
 We have shown them that we do what we say
 ''parmaanu pareekshan 1998 main 11-13 may ke bich kiye gaye, jo atal ke 19 march, 1998 ko ek gathbandhan ke mukhiya ke taur par satta main aane ke mahaj do maheene baad kii baat he
 The decision to conduct nuclear tests was one of the first few steps taken by Atal
 yah akaaran hi nahin tha
 The previous two governments had shaken the confidence of the people
 aise main 1996 main teraa dinon kii sarkaar kaa netritv kar chuke atal chaahate the ki unki sarkaar yah sandesh de ki vah ek shaktishaalee sarkaar he
 Atal was of the view that this objective was accomplished by nuclear testing, as he said in an interview to India Today, "millions of Indians have seen this opportunity as the beginning of the rise of a confident, powerful India
" '' yah pareekshan rajasthan ke ek chote shahar pokharan main kiye gaye the
 In a way, India's lead came to an end after fifteen days when Pakistan also conducted nuclear tests at Chegai Hills on 28 May
 iske baad america raashtrapati bill clinton ko kahana padaa, "do galat baton se ek sahi baat nahin hoti
 "incidentally, after the nuclear tests carried out by India, the Pakistani Foreign Minister reacted sternly, saying," The Indian leadership has become demoralized and is acting uncontrollably
 '' haalanki pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne kaha ki unka desh bhartiya pareekshanon kaa makul jawaab degaa
 Deendayal Upadhyaya, Atal's guru in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, introduced the concept of a confederation of India and Pakistan in the mid-1960s (in association with socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia)
 ek prakaar se yah avadharana akhand bharat kii us avadharana ko khandit karti thi, jiskaa samarthan charam dakshinpanthi hindu sanghathan karte aa rahe the or donon deshon ke bich achche dwi-paksheeya sambandhon kii himaayat karte the, jo kai maamalon main ek sanyukt morcha pesh kar sakate the
 Once India and then Pakistan also achieved the status of nuclear country, Atal felt that this is the right time to start a good relationship between the two countries
 pakistan main atal ke samakaksh navaj sharif bhi donon deshon ke bich achche sambandhon ko badhanaa chaahate the
 Sharif invited Atal to visit Pakistan
 pakistan nai bijepi sarkaar kii patibaddhta ko parakhnaa chahta tha
 Atal responded whole heartedly and crossed the attari-wagah Bagha border in Punjab on 19 February 1999 by bus
 seemaa paar karne ke turant baad navaj sharif ne unka swaagat kiya
 Atal said, "this is a defining moment in the history of South Asia and we have to meet this challenge
 '' atal ke sahaayak sudhindra kulkarni yaad karte hai ki kaise pakistan ke soochna mantri mushahid hossain ne unase kaha tha, "vaajapeyi ji main vaaki bada hausala he ki ve is vakt is tareeke se pakistan aa gaye
 "despite so many tremors, Atal did not give up his dream of peace between India and Pakistan
" videsh maamle unke dil ke behad kareeb the or ve bharat-pakistan sambandhon par ek amit chhap chhodia chaahate the; haalanki paristhitiyaan anukool nahin thim
 Disappointed Atal wrote in his musings from Kumarakom (where he stayed for a while on the new year in early 2001), "india is ready and willing to find a permanent solution to the Kashmir problem
" ham pakistan ke saath phir se kisi bhi str kii baatcheet, jisamen sarvocch str bhi shaamil he, karne ko taiyaar hai, basharte islamabad sakaaratmak maahaul banane kaa paryaapt saboot de
 "thus, there was a confusion in front of Atal Bihari Vajpayee whether to proceed with liberalization or not
 atal ek nattejey par jaldi hi pahunch gaye
 Liberalization was a one-way street
 udaarikaran kis rakrataar se bade, ise niyantrit kiya ja saktaa tha, lekin liya jane vaala rasta saaf tha
 After proceeding on it, it was not possible to retreat or return
 yah na keval samay kii maang thi, balki desh kii bhi maang thi or atal is baat ko lekar drudh the ki sudhaar kii prakriya aage badhegi
 In fact Atal was a liberal from the beginning
 pehali baar saansad banane ke turant baad, 1957 main atal ne pradhanmantri nehru ko loksabhaa main yah kehete suna tha ki sarkaar hotel banaaegi
 Atal was surprised
 ve bolne ke liye khadey hue or kaha ki sarkaar ko hotel nahin, aspataal banane chahie
 Nehru turned around to see who this imprudent MP was, and retorted, "we will make a profit from hotels, which will be used to build hospitals
" ''haalanki atal soviet sangh kii nitiyon ke is andhanukaran se sahamat nahin the
 After 1999, when the Atal government came to power for the third time, from then until September 2002, liberalization continued at the pace of the Prime Minister's wish
 farvari 1999 ke bajet main atal ke vitt mantri yashavanth sinha ne na sirf sheyaron ke vinievesh, balki saarvajanik kshetra ke upakramon kaa nijeekaran kii bhi manshaa jaahir kar di
 It seemed that after 2002, Atal's influence had ceased and he was unable to go further on the path of liberalization
 maamla tab bigadaa, jab saarvajanik kshetra kii do tel companiyon, bharat petroleum or hindustan petroleum ke nijeekaran kaa prastaav aayaa
 Both companies were previously multinationals (esso and Caltex), but were nationalized by the mid-1970s
 ve ranneetik kshetra main thim or atal ke ati utsaahi vinievesh mantri arun shouri donon hi companiyon ko bech dena chaahate the
 At a cabinet meeting held in February 2002, Atal gave in-principle agreement on the privatization of the two companies
 haalanki jaisi ki unki style thi, unhone vinievesh mantri arun shouri, petroleum mantri ram nike or vitt mantri yashavanth sinha ko baaki baton par nirnay lene ke liye chhod diya
 There was tremendous public discussion on the subject, and India Today published an article titled "dirty War"
 isamen sarkaar ke andar kai prakaar ke matbhedon ke bare main bataaya or yah atkal lagaai ki ek korporate yuddh chhidaa hua he
 The news raised the question that if Reliance, which was going to be a contender, would buy a single oil company, its refining capacity would be that of the government-owned Indian Oil Corporation (I
I
)
 o
 C
 ) ke baraabar ho jaaegi
 If Reliance's capability came
 o
 C
 ke baraabar ho jaati he, to ranneetik kshetra par bharat sarkaar ke niyantran ko chunauti milegi
 Actually this was the fear, especially because Reliance was considered a player in political circles
 7 sitambar, 2002 ko hui cabinet kii baithak main jab donon tel companiyon ke beche jane kaa vishay uthaa, to atal ne kaha ki ve aage baduya chaahate hai or ummid he, koi is par etraj nahin karegaa, kintu mantriyon ne apni chintaa jaahir kar di or ram nike katai taiyaar nahin the
 Even though privatization of oil companies was stopped, Atal always wanted them to happen
 darasal, unhone is kaaran hi arun shouri ko niyukt kiya tha, kyonki ve rajnatik dabaav ke aage nahin jhukenge, jabaki koi bhi netaa logon ke dabaav ke aage jhukne par majaboor ho jaataa he
 Not only this, there was truth inside Shourie and used to do his work without fear or favor
 yah bhi sachai thi ki unhone hindu vichaardhaara ko pesh karne vaali kitaaben likhi thim, jinke kaaran nagpur unhen apane nishane par aasaani se nahin le saktaa tha
 Atal was a reformer, but he was also a man of consensus
 yah baat na keval tel companiyon ke nijeekaran ko lekar dikhi, jab us faisle kaa virodh hua, balki anya maamalon main bhi aisa dekha gaya
 In the Budget of February 2002, Yashwant Sinha cut L
W
 while cutting huge government subsidies to customers on cooking domestic gas
 pi
 Yes
 silendaron kii keemton main bada ijapha kar diya
 Sinha and his finance ministry team were adamant on raising prices, but Atal ordered the finance minister to withdraw the hike
 kareebi log bataate hai ki atal ko ehsaas ho gaya tha ki madhyavarg-virdohi bajet se sarkaar kii chhavi or party ko nuksaan hoga, is kaaran aisa karnaa sahi nahin rahegaa
 Later that year, Jaswant Singh was appointed Finance Minister in place of Yashwant Sinha
 us pad ke liye shuruyaat se atal ke pasandida vyakti jaswant hi the
 *** bihar main vipakshi mahagathndhan main shaamil paanch dal aagaamee 12 oktober ko patna sthit baapu sabhaagaar main samaajawaadee netaa ram manohar lohia kii punyatithi ke avasar par ek kaarykram kaa aayojan karenge
 Addressing a joint press conference of the Mahagathbandhan (RJD, Congress, RLSP, Hindustani Awam Morcha (secular) and Vikas Insan Party) at the Congress headquarters Sadaqat Ashram, RLSP chief and former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha who is also the convenor of the event, Told that in the meeting of the Grand Alliance held fifteen days ago, all the constituent parties unanimously voiced opposition and media Trying to suppress decided to conduct programs for the BJP to oppose the dictatorship, that is embarrassing democratic rule
 unhone kaha isi ranneeti ke tahat mahagathbandhan 12 oktober ko patna sthit baapu sabhaagaar main ram manohar lohia kii punyatithi manaane ke liye ek kaarykram yojit karegaa jisamen is gathbandhan ke ghatak dalon ke sabhi pramukh netaa upasthit rahenge or ekajutata kaa pradarshan karenge
 Neither Kushwaha nor RJD MLA Kumar Sarvajit, present at the press conference, clarified whether RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav will attend the event
 kushvaha ne kaha ki samaaroh main bhaag lene ke liye unhone vam dalon ke netaaon ko bhi aamantrit kiya he
 Asked about Lohia being outspoken against the Congress, Kushwaha said that this is not entirely correct as he started his politics with this party but later made his way
 yah puche jane par ki kya jadyu ko mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit kiya jayega, kushvaha ne kaha ki yah aapkaa (media kaa) vishay he
 On repeating this question, Congress leader Akhilesh Prasad Singh said that this can be answered only when he (nitish Kumar) breaks ties with BJP
 yah puche jane par ki kya congress, jadyu ko mahagathbandhan main shaamil karne ke liye icchhuk he, congress rajya ikai ke adhyaksh madan mohan jha ne kaha ki yah ek kaalpanik sawaal he
 First came proposals from JDU
 unhone kaha ki jadyu kii ore se agar koi prastaav aata he to is bare main congress alaakaman dwaara nirnay liya jayega
 Apart from Kushwaha, Bihar Pradesh Congress President Madan Mohan Jha, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Akhilesh Prasad Singh, Vikas Insan Party chief Mukesh Sahni, RJD MLA Kumar Sarvajit and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi's party Hindustani Awam Morcha (secular) leader Anil Rajak was present
 jaise subah se din kaa pataa chal jaataa he, vaise hi film jab harry met sejal kii pehali jhalak rahi
 Shah Rukh Khan seems to have tried to bring emotional sentiment to the story in the cycle of casting
 anoushka sharma bhi parde par asahaj hi lagati hai
 As far as Harry Met Sejal director Imtiaz Ali is concerned, he is giving similar films from year to year
 unka complex romance kai baar ankhon main aansu to le aata he lekin apane saath baandh nahin paata he
 So when Harry Met Sejal starts to bore
 kahani to hamen pataa aise hi haijab harry met sejal bhi duusari bollywood filmon kii tarah hi pridictable he
 In the film, tour guide Harry is seen with an Indian group visiting Europe
 vah is samooh kii tasviren khinchataa he or unke bich rahakar kuch anokhaa anubhav paane kii ummid karata he, jise vah apni jindagi main miss kar rahaa he
 What is this deficiency? Imtiaz Ali answers this
 ve bataate hai ki ham apni seat par gahari neend main hai!harry or sejal kii mulaakaat tab hoti he, jab sejal apni angesement ring kho detii he
 Sejal's entire family returns to India, but Sejal says that she will return to India only when she finds her engagement ring
 is tarah ek 'khoe hue tour guide' or 'gidence kii jaruratmand gujarati ladki' kii yatra shuru hoti he
 Shah Rukh had earlier made others brides, but with this, the trouble of the audience starts when Harry met Sejal
 shahrukh ne is film main aisa kuch nahin kiya, jo unhone pehle na kiya ho
 He has even outshined others in many films before
 dilavaale vaale dulhaniya le jaaenge to yaad hi hogi aapako!jahaan tak jab harry met sejal main anoushka ke kirdaar kii baat he to unhone apane gujarati accent ke alaava kuch nayaa nahin kiya
 Imtiaz has definitely innovated a bit
 unki film karan johar kii 2000 ke dashak kii film lagati he, jisamen hajaaron gane hai, romantic dialog or behad ubaau kairactor bhi hai
 It is a must that you can see the cities of Budapest, Prague, Berlin, Lisbon, Vienna etc
 as long as the film is on screen
 is film main aisa kuch nahin he ki aap film ko nazren gadhaakar dhyaan se dekhen
 Where will Shahrukh Khan's career now It is true that Shahrukh's work of the last 25 years has been liked, but it is also true that he is going to create a big confusion in front of the audience with this film
 bhale hi film main aapako shahrukh ke taur par rahul yaa dil vaale dulhaniya le jaaenge ke raaj najar aa jaaen, lekin sejal simran bilkul bhi nahin hai
 Anushka Sharma does not look like Kajol
 150 minute tak anoushka kaa gujarati accent koi sukhad ahsaas nahin detaa he
 There are so many songs in the film that after a certain period you will stop counting them
 yadi jab harry met sejal nahin banati to bhi bollywood main koi fark paidaa nahin hone vaala tha
 This film has added a bad film to the filmography of the trio of Shah Rukh, Anushka and Imtiaz
 bhale hi shahrukh ko apni film ke gane- safar kaa hi tha main safar kaa rahaa
 
 
 Relax, but meeting Harry and Sejal may not be a good experience for everyone else

 ) pradhanmantri narendra modi ne america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ke saath radio kaarykram main ‘man kii baat’ kii
 PM Modi started the conversation saying that Barak means in the Swili language, which is blessed
 modi ne kahaaki agar ham kuch karte hai to hamen santosh miltaa he
 But if we just dream and don't do anything then there is disappointment
 maine kabhi koi sapana nahin dikhaa, bas junun he ki kuch karnaa he
 Obama said that i am happy with the reception in India
 bharat or america donon mahaan loktantr hai
 People in America are affected by Modi's poverty reduction program in India
 mahila shashaktikaran, shiksha, swasthya, rojgaar jaise muddon par bharat kaa kaam saraahneey he
 India is a natural friend of America
 simaaon main antar ke baavjood ham sab ek hai
 Obama said that both of us rose up from the same life
 soochnaaon kaa prabhaav rokna mushkilobama ne kaha ki ab soochnaaon ke pravaah ko rokna sambhav nahin he
 Today's youth has virtually the entire world and information at their fingertips
 unhen maaloom he ki samaaj or desh ke liye kya karnaa chahie
 i understand that governments and leaders should not only govern from above, but should reach the people in an inclusive and transparent manner
 unase unke desh kii disha ke bare main baat kerani chahie
 He said that the great thing for India and America is that both are open societies
 unhone kaha ki meraa maananaa he ki band or niyantrit samaajon kii banisbat bharat or america jaise desh is nae soochna yug main or safaltaaen arjeet kar sakate hai
 Modi influenced himself by the life of Benjamin Franklin
 On the question of which American President Modi himself said, i had heard the name of John Kennedy a lot during school days
 lekin baad main maine benjamin franklin kii biography padhi
 In which i learned to think life better through small things
 main unke jivan se prabhavit hua
 If you want to transform your life, then you can get inspiration from it
 meri salaah he ki sabhi logon ko unki jeevani padhani chahie
 Obama's daughters wanted to come to India
 Manobama said in response to a question that my daughters wanted to come to India but due to examinations, my daughters could not come to India

 Whether i remain President or not, i will definitely come to India
 modi ne iskaa swaagat karte hue kaha ki aap jab bhi bharat aaen, bharat aapke swaagat ke liye taiyaar he
 On the question of daughters' defective Modi, on the question of Obama's help on Beti Bachao Beti Padhao campaign, Modi said that our attitude towards daughters is faulty
 beti bachaana, beti padhaanaa ye hamaara saamaajik or saanskrithik kartavya or maanviya jimmevary he
 The way Obama raises his two daughters is an inspiration in itself
 bharat main linganupaat ek chintaa kaa vishay he or iskaa mul kaaran ladke or ladki ke prati hamaara doshapurn ravaiya he
 Ever thought about reaching this position? Regarding becoming the PM of the country, Modi said that no, i never imagined that i would become PM
 main lambey arse se sabko yah kahata aayaa hum ki kuch bhi banane ke sapane kabhi mat dekho
 If you want to dream, then look at doing something
 aaj bhi kuch banane ke sapane mere dimag main hai hi nahin, lekin kuch karne ke jarur hai
 On this question, Obama said that he had never imagined reaching the White House
 unhone kaha ki vah or modi khushnaseeb hai ki ek saamaanya parivesh se aane ke baavjood dono ko asaamaanya avasar mili
 He said that what could be better for India and America than a tea seller or a person like me who was raised by a single mother, they are leading their respective countries today

 This slogan lasted for many decades, but i understand that in view of the power of today's youth and what it has access to, i will say, 'youth unite the world'
 main samajhataa hum unamem yah takat he or vah ye kar sakate hai
 Regarding the new generation of youth, Obama said that the new generation of youth is a global citizen and is not bound by time and boundaries
