 Arvind Kejriwal, the Chief Minister of Delhi and 'AAP' Supremo, has set the tone for the Lok Sabha elections
 kejariwal ke nishane par rajdhani kii 7 loksabhaa siten hai
 For this, he has launched a movement to get full statehood status to Delhi
 kejariwal kii raajnneeti ko andolan suut karata he
 When he contested elections in Delhi for the first time in 2013, Lokpal was made an issue and he gained power on its own
 2015 main bhi unhone lokapal or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf andolan ko lekar janata kaa vishwaas jeeta
 Both times, the public supported him and reposed faith in Kejriwal's movement
 ab 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye kejariwal ek baar phir andolan ke raste se 'indraprastha' kii 7 sabase badi siton par kabja jamaana chaahate hai
 It is evident that time is short, so preparations are increasing
 ravivaar ko dilli ke mukhyamantri ne apane awaas par 'aap' ke sabhi vidhayakon or bade netaaon kii baithak bulaai
 The issue of the slogan "LG Quit Delhi" was to launch a large-scale movement in the entire state to make Delhi a full state
 is baithak main kejariwal ne naaraa diya "LG dilli chodo"
 After this meeting, Kejriwal has announced that he will contest the Delhi elections on the issue of full rights and now AAP has started preparing for the movement in that direction
 'aap' dilli pradesh adhyaksh gopal raay ne kaha ki dilli main aam aadmi party purna rajya ke andolan ko aage badhayegi
 There will be a two-stage program from 17 June to 24 June
 dilli main 300 jagahon par baithkon kaa aayojan hoga or duusare charan ke tahat 1 july ko indira gandhi stadium main purna rajya ke liye pradesh str sammelan hoga, jisamen andolan kii agali ruparekha taiyaar kii jaaegi or kejariwal khud agali ranneeti kaa elaan karenge
 Since 2015, after regaining power in Delhi, Kejriwal's relationship has been bitter with the Modi government at the center, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party in Delhi and the Chief Administrator of Delhi, the Lieutenant Governor
 gaahe-bagaahe arvind kejariwal centre kii modi sarkaar par dilli main sarkaar ke kaam main adnga lagane, raajnneetik netritv ko pareshaan karne or sarkaar ko thap karne ke aarope lagaate rahe hai
 At present, several central agencies are investigating allegations against several departments of Kejriwal government and their ministers
 'aap' netaa saurabh bharadwaj ne kaha ki hamane 3 saal tak hamane sari koshish kar lee, haath jode, minnaten kin
 Talked to everyone from the Central Government to the Ministry of Home Affairs to the Lieutenant Governor, but today the work of all-round development is being completely stalled, so it has to be thought that a full state has to be created and the way of Delhi's work Has to be carried forward
 dilli ko puraa adhikaar dene ke prastaav kaa khaakaa taiyaar'aap' ne dilli ko puraa adhikaar dene ke liye prastaav kaa khaakaa bhi taiyaar kiya he
 Under this proposal, the New Delhi area of the capital, where the President's residence is, the Prime Minister's residence, the Parliament, and the foreign embassies are said to be run directly under the administration of the Central Government, while New Delhi is chosen to be here
 It has been said to subdue Delhi under the government
 'aap' kaa aarope he ki ek samay par bijepi or congress donon ne hi dilli ko puraa adhikaar dilaane ke liye raajnneetik ladaai ladi, jise ab tyaag diya gaya he
 Some time ago, Kejriwal had also talked about getting a referendum in the capital on the issue of granting full statehood to Delhi
 refrendom hua nahin, lekin kejariwal dilli ke vidhansabha main vishesh satr bulaakar dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja die jane sambandhit ek prastaav lekar aae hai
 This proposal will be sent to the central government, on the other hand a strategy will be prepared to surround the opposition on the roads
 aap ke vishwast sutron kii maane to is andolan ke peeche darasal kejariwal kaaphi kuch soch rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party feels that in 2019, whoever comes to power in New Delhi will also need 7 seats in small states like Delhi and in such a case, full rights can be demanded in return for support
 aam charchaa he ki aap kshetreey partiyon dwaara banaae ja rahe mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa hogi, lekin kya wo mahagathbandhan kejariwal kii maang ko puraa kar paaegaa?duusare dal bhi is maang se sahmatarashtriya janata dal ke nae navele rajyasabha saansad manoj jha kehete hai ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dena dilli ke logon par ehsaan nahin balki unka adhikaar he or mahagathbandhan kejariwal kii is maang ko puraa karnaa hoga
 When Nitish Kumar came to meet Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi, in alliance with RJD, who became the Chief Minister of Bihar, he also supported the demand of granting full statehood to Delhi
 vampanthi dal sipiai bhi kejariwal kii is maang se sahamat he
 CPI MP d Raja issued a statement saying that we agree with the demand for full statehood status to Delhi as it is the oldest demand for the capital
 dilli ke saath puduccheri ko bhi puraa adhikaar milanaa chahie, kyonki donon hi jagahon par vidhansabha he jahaan log apni sarkaar chunate hai
 There is a lot of conflict between the Lieutenant Governor and the elected government in Delhi and in such a situation the conflict over the rights of the two will continue till it gets full state status
 bijepi-congress kar chuki he puraa adhikaar dene kaa vaadisase pehle itihaas ke panne khangale to 1998 se lekar 2014 or 2015 tak ke chunaavon main chaahe bijepi ho yaa congress har kisi ne dilli ko puraa adhikaar dene kaa vaayada apane chunavi ghoshnaa patron main kiya
 During the BJP rule, the then Home Minister LK Advani brought Delhi to the draft to grant full statehood status, which was then sent to the Standing Committee headed by Pranab Mukherjee for consideration
 bijepi ke kaddavar netaa sahib singh verma se lekar madan laal khurana or purv dilli pradesh adhyaksh dow

 It is another matter that Sheila Dixit now feels that the elected government in Delhi has to work by building relations with the Central Government and the Lieutenant Governor
 shila dikshit kaa aarope he ki kejariwal bahaanaa bana rahe hai
 On this statement of Sheila Dixit, Kejriwal took the help of social media and wrote that Sheila ji, 10 years at your time was your own government, your LG at the center
 main chalange karata hum ek saal modi raaj main dilli chalaa ke dikhaa do
 Please talk to your Chief Minister in Puducherry and give them this knowledge too
 is raajnneetik nurakushti main virdohi kejariwal kii chaal ko bakhubi samajhate hai
 While Sheila Dixit feels that Kejriwal is running away from her responsibilities, the BJP is also alleging that the Chief Minister of Delhi is actually running away from his responsibilities
 dilli pradesh adhyaksh manoj tiwari kaa kahana he ki bijepi bhi dilli ko puraa haq dene ke paksh main he, lekin uske liye pehle arvind kejariwal ko sarvadaleey baithak bulaane ke saath-saath vidwaanon kii raay leni chahie
 However, bjp's allegation is that they are failing to solve Delhi, which is facing other problems like water scarcity, that is why they are raising the issue of full statehood

 In the important meeting of All India Relations Department of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) held at Osmania University Hyderabad, Hyderabad on August 3 to 4, it has been decided to run a mass public relations campaign by establishing contact teams
 is baithak main sabhi praanton main sampark vibhaag kaa kaam dekh rahe padaadhikariyon ko bulaayaa gaya tha
 He was entrusted with the task of communicating specific individuals of the society with the Sangh and communicating exclusively to those who are unknowingly malicious or abusive about the Sangh or its ideology
 sangh kii koshish he ki vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par dushman bane logon ko bhi apana dost banaaya jaae
 This was the first meeting of Ramlal, who returned to the Sangh after being the General Secretary of the organization for 13 years in the BJP
 vah akhil bhartiya sah sampark pramukh ke taur par is baithak main shaamil hue
 In this meeting of the liaison department of the union, it was said that our target is not the people who support the union
 ve to apane hai hi, hamaara to main target ve log hai jo sangh ke bare main jaanate nahin phir bhi durbhaavna rakhte hai
 We also have to make our own
 hamaari koshish honi chahie ki agar koi dost na bane to kam se kam dushman bhi na rahe
 It was observed in the meeting that it has been seen that there is a bias among the people due to misinformation propagated by the opponents
 yahaan tak ki jo nirpeksh (neutral) log hai, jinhen na sangh se lenaa-dena he yaa na hi anya kisi vipareet vichaardhaara vaale sanghathan se
 Most of them also take wrong care about the Sangh
 baithak main charchaa hui ki virodhiyon kii ore se failaai gai sangh kii ek sampradayik sanghathan kii chhavi ke jhaanse main samaaj ke vishisht log aa jate hai
 While in reality the Sangh is the largest volunteer and social organization in the world
 aise main un sabhi ko target par lekar vyapak sampark abhiyaan chalanaa chahie, jo sangh ke bare main galat dharanaon ke shikaar hai
 a union official attending the meeting called aajtak
 in se sampark vibhaag ke kaam ke bare main kaha," yah sangh virodhiyon kaa bhi dil jeetne ke liye kaam karata he
 It consists of intellectually intelligent, patient, prolific communicative or other level activists with amazing communication skills
 jo gairon ko bhi apana banane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 The goal of the liaison department is to make bridges between the union and outside people
 yah aresas ke prachaar vibhaag se bahut alag hota he
 In recent years, if celebrities like Ratan Tata, Pranab Mukherjee came close to the Sangh, it was the success of the liaison department
 "ek anya sangh padaadhikari ne kaha," yah samvaad kshamta hi rahi, jiske dam par bhagwaan gautam buddha, angulimaal jaise daaku kaa hriday parivartan karne main safal rahe
 In such a situation, we believe that it is the power in the dialogue that we can make our opponents as well
 "10 shreniyan banaain gayi, sampark se pehle homevarksang ne sampark ke liye samaaj ke alag-alag virgon kii das shreniyan banaai hai
 a team of special officers has been formed to contact every category
 jisamen anbhavi padaadhikari shaamil rahenge
 For example, there will be separate group of Sangh for contact with the celebrities of classes such as scientist, doctor, engineer, businessman, social worker, teacher etc
 masalan kisi chikitsak se sampark karte samay sangh kii koshish rahegi ki team main koi swayamsevi chikitsak yaa medical kaa jaankaar vyakti rahe
 So that there is ease in communication
 darasal, jab do vyaktiyon main koi ubhaynishth yani kaaman pahalu hota he to unke bich samvaad ke safal hone kii gunjaaish zyada hoti he
 Apart from this, the liaison department of the union will do homework before going to the specific persons of the society
 kyonki prabhavi vaartalap na hone par samvaad ke vifal hone kii gunjaaish rahati he
 People involved in the contact team of the Sangh are very cautious about the selection of words, etc
 during the dialogue
 sangh ke ek padaadhikari ne rochak prasang bataate hue kaha ki ek baar ek bade prachaarak, ritred sainya adhikariyon se sampark karne gaye
 At the beginning of the conversation he took a lot of time to discuss patriotism, nationalism
 jis par sainya adhikariyon ne kaha- bhaisahab, ham sena main hi rahakar aae hai, hamase zyada deshbhakti ke bare main koun jaanegaa, aap hamen kya jimmedaari dena chaahate hai, behatar hai ki kam samay main usee par charchaa karen
 Because of the ideology of the Sangh, we want to connect with its projects
 sangh ke padaadhikari ke mutabik sambandhit prachaarak ne baad main is vaakye kii sangh ke bade sheersh padaadhikariyon se charchaa kii
 After which it was decided that the officials of the liaison department would not go to meet specific people of the society without doing homework

 sashastr bal nyaayaadhikaran ne 1999 ke kargil sangharsh ke dauraan sena ke netritv par sawalia nishaan lagaate hue ek purv le
 The General is blamed for being prejudiced against the Brigadier who led many important successes
 nyaayaadhikaran ke anusaar purv le general ne purvaagrah se grast hokar na keval us brigadier kii uplabdhiyon ko kamatar kar aanka balki yuddh kaa galat vivaran bhi diya

 unhone kaha ki is kram main kai baadhaon ko dur karnaa padaa
 Brigadier Singh (retd) said, 'by order of the Tribunal, the post of Major General will be considered for indicative promotions
 ’ unhone kaha ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan sangharsh se sambandhit dastaveton ko bhi durust kiya jayega
 His petition was transferred by the Delhi High Court to the principal branch of the tribunal

 badmaashon ne yatriyon ke saath marpet bhi kii
 The passengers alleged that the GRP and RPF showed very negligence in this case
 udhar, police ne is ghatana se inkaar kiya he
 Arriving at Lucknow station, the passengers expressed their anger
 unke mutabikatrain main badmaashonor yatriyon ke bich khub chhina jhapati or maar peet hui
 After which some miscreants were caught in the train reaching Moradabad and handed over to RPF but due to lack of good response from the police, the passengers kept some miscreants and brought them with them to Lakhnau
 yatriyon kii maane to is bich takreeban 4 badmaash train se kud kar bhaag gaye
 However, in the meantime, the passengers also tweeted to the RPF for help, but on receiving no response from their side, the passengers captured the remaining miscreants and landed at Lucknow station and handed them over to the police there
 udhar, police ne lutpaat kii ghatana se inkaar kiya he, police ke mutabik sabhi aaropee haryana kii kisi fectry main kaam karne vaale majdoor the or ve deepawali par ghar ja rahe the
 Meanwhile, this incident has come to light with the passengers
 is sambandh main police ne ipisi kii dhara 323, 504, 506 kaa mukadmaa darj kar aage kii kaarywahi shuru kar di he
 Passengers told that about 16 miscreants boarded the train from Jagadhri station in Haryana
 jinhone vahaan se lekar uttarakhand ke rudki tak yatriyon se marpet orlutpataki
 All the miscreants had lathi poles
 police ne raste main ek stesan par 7 badmaashon ko raat main hiraasat main liya
 But despite this, from 11:30 pm to 2 pm, the miscreants in the train made a furore
 subah lakhanu-chandigarh express train (12232) jab lakhanu ke platform number 3 par pahunchi to jiarapy ne yatriyon dwaara pakade gaye badmaashon ko hiraasat main liya
 a woman who threw her one-year-old girl from a moving train in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal was arrested on Monday
 yah jaankaree police ne di
 The girl is admitted to a hospital where she is struggling for life
 ghatana somvaar ko subah kolkata se 40 kimi dur naihati railway stesan ke kareeb ghati
 The arrested woman, Poornima Das boarded a suburban train from Naihati
 train jaise hi stesan se baahar nikali, usne apni bacchee ko baahar phenk diya
 Shocked by the incident, the passengers pulled the chain and stopped the train and handed over the woman to the police
 naihati police thane ke ek adhikari ne bataaya, bacchee ko aspataal main bhartee karvaa diya gaya he
 His condition remains critical
 mahila kaa kahana he ki usne jab se bacchee ko janm diya, tabhi se uske sasuraal vaale use maansik or shaareerik rup se pratadit kar rahe the, isiilie vah bacchee se apana peechha chhudaana chaahati thi
 Along with the surrender in the Oval Test, the Indian cricket team lost 1–4 in the five-match Test series at the hands of England
 is puri siries main aise kai maukey aae jab team india match ke nattejey apane paksh main kar sakati thi, bharat ne bahut sari galtiyaan kin or england ko vaapasi karne kaa nyotaa diya
 In this series, Team India lost 4 times to win, due to which they had to lose 4 matches
 cricket ek team game he, kisi ek yaa do khilaadi par nirbhar nahin karata he
 Virat Kohli has scored 593 runs in this Test series, but despite this he could not win the series to Team India
 england kaa koi ballebaaj bhale hi kohli jitne ran nahin bana paaya ho lekin, phir bhi english team ne siries par kabja kar liya
 Big things were being talked about before the series started, but this number 1 team of the Test has proved to be a laggard
 ballebaaji main lachar pradarshan se lekar team india ke gendbaajon kaa ahm maukon par wicket nahin le paanaa use le duba
 The biggest reason for losing a better chance of winning the series on England soil was that in every match that the Indian team would have made a good catch, the England's tail batsmen would throw water on it
 in lamhon main kharaab khelkar bharat ne ganvaai serisbarmingham test main sam kuren team india ke liye saradard sabit hue
 Chris Woakes at Lord's, batting at number seven, denied India a win by scoring his first century of his career, and once again at Southampton, Sam Curren wrote a script featuring Birmingham
 ummid thi ki bhartiya team ovel main test match jitkar apni izzat bachaa legi
 However, due to the successive defeats, the defeated team India could not even compete with hosts England in this match
 pehali pari main england ke 181 ran par 7 wicket giraane ke baad team india ne apni pakad aisi dhili kii ki england ke aakhri teen ballebaajon ne 151 ran jodate hue 332 kaa score board par laga diya
 Team India lost by 118 runs at the Oval, England won the 4–1 Test series, after which Ravindra Jadeja and Hanuma Vihari helped India reach a score of 292
 england kii duusari pari main to bhartiya gendbaajon ne pehle hi hathiyaar daal die or elistare cook or jo root kii 259 ranon kii partnership ne bharat ko match se baahar karte hue 464 ranon kaa pahaad jaisaa target de daalaa
 In the fourth innings, when the turn of the Indian batsmen came, Shikhar Dhawan (1), Cheteshwar Pujara (0) and captain Virat Kohli (0) also lost courage and did not show the courage to stay on the pitch
 haalanki rahul or rishabh pant ne apni pichhali naakaamiyon se sikhte hue shandaar shatak lagaae
 However, he could not save Team India from defeat
 ab aage kya?ab viraat kii sena kii asal pariksha australia main hogi, kyonki westeindies jaisi team ko haraana koi badi baat nahin, wo siries to team india ke liye practice maichon kii tarah hogi
 Rishabh Pant's amazing in England- Dhoni did what he could not, Virat has done better than expected as a batsman, but the captain can succeed only when his team performs

 anuchhed 370 hataane kaa mudda bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke pramukh muddon main se ek rahaa
 BJP had promised to remove it
 After coming to government for the second time, BJP fulfilled this promise by neutralizing the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and dividing the state in two
 somvaar yani 5 agast kaa din itihaas main aise din ke rup main yaad kiya jayega, jab narendra modi sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 ke kai praavdhaanon ko hataa diya or use do centre shasit pradeshon main vibhajit kar diya
 On the morning of August 5, when Home Minister Amit Shah presented a resolution in the Rajya Sabha to remove the provisions of Article 370, the Amarnath Yatra was stopped, tourists and students were evacuated from Jammu and Kashmir, Internet services were shut down , Injunction was issued
 purv siem mahabuuba mufti or umr abdulla samet kai netaa najarband kiye ja chuke the
 The opposition failed to block the Article 370 resolution in the Rajya Sabha even after stiff opposition by the major opposition parties, including the Congress
 vahiin, 31 july ko rajyasabha main teen talaak bill paarit hone ke baad apane mukhya chunavi muddon ke sambandh main, ek saptaah main modi sarkaar ko yah duusari safalataa haath lagi
 The India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) analyzed the election manifestos of the BJP and the Congress and found that while the BJP has always been in favor of abolishing Article 370, the oldest party remained silent on the issue 
 bijepi, congress or kashmirabijepi or congress donon ke chunaav ghoshnapatron kaa vishleshan karte hue, DIU ne paaya ki congress 2009 or 2014 main anuchhed 370 ko lekar shant rahi
 On the other hand, the BJP kept repeating its resolve to remove it through its manifesto during that time
 keval 2009 ke ghoshnaptr main congress ne 'kashmir' kaa ullekh kiya tha, jisamen yah kaha gaya tha ki congress party kii sarkaar rajya ko paryaapt dhan dene main sakasham he
 While the oldest party in 2014 did not say anything about Article 370 in its election manifesto, the word 'kashmir' mentioned only two places
 congress ne 2 baar, rojgaar or rajya ke chaatro ke khilaaf bhedbhaav kii soochna ke sandarbh main kashmir kaa naam apane ghoshnaptr main shaamil kiya tha
 In 2019, the BJP emerged as a major challenge before the Congress on the Kashmir issue, after which the Congress placed an entire section on issues related to Jammu and Kashmir in its election manifesto
 2009 or 2019 ke bich, yah pehali baar tha jab congress ne dhara 370 par apana rukh saaf kiya
 The Congress's Manifesto 2019 wrote, 'the Congress reiterates that the entire Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India
 ham rajya ke vishesh itihaas or un adwitiya paristhitiyon kaa bhi sammaan karte hai, jinke tahat rajya ne bharat main vilay ko sweekaar kiya, jiske vajah se bharat ke samvidhan main anuchhed 370 ko shaamil kiya gaya
 There will neither be permission to change this constitutional position, nor will anything be attempted
 'congress ne jammu kashmir main sashastr bal (vishesh shaktiyaan) adhinium yani AFSPA kii samiksha karne or satta main aane par suraksha balon kii tainaati kaa bhi vaada kiya
 On the other hand, BJP had a more diverse and clear stance on Kashmir related issues than the Congress
 2009 main, bijepi ne apane ghoshnaptr main 12 baar 'kashmir' kaa ullekh kiya, jisamen usne anuchhed 370 ko radd karne, pioke sharnaarthiyon ko adhikaar pradaan karne, kashmiri panditon ko phir se ghati main basaane, ladakh, jammu or kashmir kshetron main teen-tarafa vikasaatmak gatividhiyon ko anjaam dene va aatankwaad se nipatane aadi ke bare main baat rakhi
 In the manifesto, BJP wrote in the context of Article 370, 'section 370 is a psychological barrier to joining the people of Jammu and Kashmir with the national mainstream
 bijepi is anuchhed ko nirast karne ke liye patibaddh he
 However, in 2014, the mention of Kashmir in the bjp's manifesto decreased from 12 to 6 times, but the BJP remained committed to its stand on the state
 bijepi ne kaha ki vah dhara 370 ko nirast karne ke apane rukh par adig he
 In the 2014 manifesto, BJP said, 'BJP repeats its stand on Article 370 and will discuss it with all stakeholders
 saath hi wo is anuchhed ko nirast karne ke liye patibaddh he
 'in 2019 too, the BJP mentioned' Kashmir '6 times in its manifesto focusing on the issues of Jammu and Kashmir
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi ne ghoshnaptr main kaha, 'ham jansangh ke samay se hi anuchhed 370 ko hataane kii apane mat ko doharaa rahe hai
 'its relationship with BJP and Kashmiri issues was established by BJP in 1980
 anuchhed 370 par party kii asahmati kaa pehla pramaan uske 1984 ke ghoshnaptr main miltaa he
 In this, the BJP did not specifically mention this article in the context of Jammu and Kashmir, but it wanted to 'temporarily remove Article 370'
 1989 main, bijepi ne dhara 370 ko radd karne ke apane vaade ko doharaaya, or 'pakistani samarthak' tatwon dwaara rajya main chalaae ja rahe 'ghrinaa abhiyaan' ke badhane ke bare main bhi chintaa vyakt kii thi
 There was a migration of Hindus from the valley in 1991
 iske baad bijepi ke ghoshnaptr ne dhara 370 par apana rukh dohraane ke alaava, rajya ke hinduon ko prabhavit karne vaali hinsa par apni chintaa vyakt kii or pakistani tatwon ko ghati se ukhaad phenkane kaa vaada kiya
 The bjp-led NDA came to power for the first time in 1996, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government fell due to lack of majority in 13 days
 party ne 1996 ke chunavi ghoshnaptr main bhi kashmir se sambandhit muddon par vyapak drushtikon rakhaa tha
 Kashmir was mentioned 16 times in the party's vision document
 isamen ladakh, jammu or kashmir ke liye teen kshetreey parishaden sthapit karne kii baat kahi gai thi
 The BJP in its manifesto had also criticized the lack of consciousness of the state's Congress government, affecting issues related to the border
 1996 ke ghoshnaptr main bijepi ne likhaa, 'jammu-kashmir kii niti taiyaar karne main congress kii sarkarein vifal rahi hai jiske kaaran rajya kii aantarik samasyaon ne aisi sthiti paidaa kar di he, jisase kashmir bhartiya rashtriyata ke liye pramukh chunauti banakar ubhara he
 BJP realizes this dreadful challenge
 party rajya kii aantarik samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye samarpit karti he, balki lagbhag 5 dashakon se pakistan dwaara avaidh rup se kabjae gaye apane kshetra ke hisse ko punah praapt karne kii disha main kaam karne ke liye bhi patibaddh he
 In 1998, the bjp-led NDA (coalition) again formed the government, but the government collapsed within a year due to lack of majority
 haalanki, kashmir par party kaa rukh nahin badla
 In 1999, the BJP issued a very short manifesto that did not mention Kashmir
 haalanki, 2004 ke baad se, party kashmir ke liye apni drushti ko sakriy rup se aage badhaati aa rahi he
 The BJP did not mention anything about Article 370 in its 1999 manifesto
 endie sarkaar ke 5 saal baad, 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main anuchhed 370 phir se bijepi ke vijan document se gaayab rahaa
 However, the party's vision of the three-way development of the state was still intact
 2009 ke baad, anuchhed 370 ek baar phir bijepi ke vijan document main shaamil hua jise 5 agast 2019 ko bijepi vaali centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne amali jama pahana diya
 Note: Since the 1984 general elections, BJP has digitized all its manifestos which are available on its website
 ham congress ke ghoshnaptr kaa vishleshan karne main asamarth the kyonki iske digital ank keval 2009 ke chunaav ke baad uplabdh the

 In order to escape from jail, he also killed a head constable

 chaahe vah 'nai manzil' yojana ho yaa phir musalmaan kaarigaron ke liye shuru kii gai 'ustad' yojana ho
 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who was counted as the main minority face of the BJP, launched a progressive panchayat campaign to establish the credibility of the BJP and Narendra Modi among Muslims, and attracted them to the BJP with slogans like 'madad Hamari Manzil Aapki'
 Have to do it too
 ve ise vot ke saude se baahar nikalakar vikaas ke masaude par chalane kii siyasat bataa rahe hai
 Despite this, selective silence from time to time on the attacks on Narendra Modi's minority community has been exasperated

 Opposition has been vocal on his escape from this prison and then his encounter by the police
 iske alaava yah kanoon kii saakh par bhi batta he
 After all, the prisoners under consideration are responsible to the state and the judiciary

 Until someone is proved guilty, he is considered innocent
 aise main vaise criminals to kabhi bhi sarender karne se rahe jinhen aisa shaq hoga ki rajya kii police atantogatva unhen maar hi degi or nyaayalay se to unhen nyaay milane se rahaa
 While this encounter has the potential to destroy Narendra Modi's efforts to woo minorities, it will also prove to be a case study for the court and law of this country

 Some time ago, a party registered in the Election Commission became a problem for Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party
 AAP ke netaa is party se itane pareshaan hue ki ve sidhe dilli hai court chale gaye
 To explain what the whole scene is, we first tell you the name of this party
 chunaav ayog se registerd hui nai party kaa naam he 'aapaki apni party' he
 In short, AAP
 dilli main is naam se ek party pehle hi registerd he
 Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal is the party's performer
 is party ke registerd hote hi aam aadmi party ne is nae dal ko yah kahkar court main ghaseet liya ki is party kaa naam unke dal se miltaa julata he or matadaata vot dete samay bhram main pad sakate hai
 When the matter reached the court, the Delhi High Court sought an answer from the Election Commission in this matter
 mangalvaar hui sunwaayee main chunaav ayog ne court ko die apane jawaab main bataaya he ki jab bhi vah koi nai party register karti he to uske sankshipt rup (abbreviation) ko dekhakar nahin balki register hone vaali party ke puure naam ko dekha jaataa he
 The Election Commission told the court that while registering the new party it has been taken care of and there can be no reason for confusion between the two parties as both have different names
 baharhaal is nae dal 'aapaki apni party' ne is maamle main apana jawaab daakhil karne ke liye dilli hai court se kuch or vakt maanga he
 The court has given time till 22 February to respond to your own party and Aam Aadmi Party in this matter
 arvind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party is maamle ko court tak isliye le gai he kyonki unhen lagata he ki matadaata agar in donon partiyon ke naam se kanphyus hue to isse aam aadmi party ke vot aapaki apni party ko ja sakate hai

 bharat ganraajya kii rajdhani dilli main ek path he, janpath
 The number of its two houses is 10 and 12
 10, janpath sonia gandhi kaa ghar he or 12, janpath ramvilas paswan kaa
 Both have one till the wall, but today the guests were not the neighbors, but they were those whom Paswan once left as communal
 paswan bijepi chhodane ke maamle main nitish se senior hai, tabhi nitish ke alag hone par tikhi tippanee kii thi ki chale hai nakhun kataakar shahid banane
 Today Paswan returned to the NDA after 12 years and has left his 2002 great martyrdom for the JDU, RJD and Congress
 bihar kii raajnneeti aap sinerio shabd ke bina nahin samaj sakate hai
 Today's scenes take a look at the scenery before coming to what the cinereo was made of
 aaj dopaher ravishankar prasad rajeev pratap rudi or shahanvaj hossain 12, tughlaq road pahunche
 In the picture it looks as if you have come here for the first time
 daravaaje par court pant main netaa kam, hero zyada dikh rahe sansadeey board ke chairman chiraag paswan swaagat karte hai or ye teenon lojpa rashtriya adhyaksh or chiraag ke pita ramvilas paswan se milane chale jate hai
 Ravi Shankar came out and said that he had come to eat tea and sweets
 meetha par meetha
 Oh dear
 
 
 etna
 Ravishankar or Rudy or Shahnawaz, who looked fit at this age, must have eaten sweets before tea, i don't think you know
 lagata he chaay ke saath namakeen aaj nitish or lalu kha rahe honge
 The scene then changes scenery
 chiraag paswan shahanvaj kii gaadi main baithkar dharmendra pradhan ke ghar jate hai
 Shahnawaz ji's car number is also James Bond type
 
 
 007
 If you are looking at what is in Dharmendra Pradhan's house, then remove and see Rudy Saheb and Chirag Ji on the couch
 poj is tarah kaa he ki sab finaley he
 Just you Araria will see, we will handle Ara
 thik 10 saal pehle 10, janpath se nikalakar sonia paswan ke ghar 12 janpath chali gai thim
 This photo of December 27, 2003 created a lot of sensation, like today Chirag is producing a picture of Rudy
 tab paswan ko milaanaa sonia kaa master stroke tha, aaj modi ne us master stroke ko doharaa diya
 Do not look at the prime time to know what is going on in Bihar and who is going on it, call Patna
 aakhir congress, lalu ne paswan ko kyon jane diya or modi ne paswan ko kyon liya? raajnneeti main galati or galatchhemiyaan garlfrand kii tarah hoti hai
 Sorry for the feminist today
 ab aate hai sinerio par
 Is Bihar politics going back to caste? Why did the Modi wave in Bihar, the proclamation of the BJP need local tornadoes like Kushwaha and Paswan? Was there no casteism in Nitish's politics of development? What is Mahadalit and backward? Is the Congress not going to Lalu because of Yadav's base? Will BJP and Modi leave the issue of ending dynasty because of Paswan? ramvilas paswan lojpa ke rashtriya adhyaksh hai, bete chiraag paswan lojpa sansadeey board ke chairman hai
 Ramchandra Paswan is the national vice president of LJP
 ek or bhai paras paswan bihar lojpa ke adhyaksh hai
 Hajipur, Samastipur and Jamui are also for these three Paswanas in the seat agreement
 vanshavaad ko jad se mitaa dene ke abhiyaan par nikle modi jadon se vanshavaad ko dhundhakar nikaal rahe hai
 His three allies Akali Dal, Shiv Sena and LJP are dynasties, but in Punjab, Modi replaces the Badal family as a model
 kehete hai ki bade badal sahab kaa dil kheti-kisaani main laga rahata he or chote badal kaa dil udyogon main laga rahata he
 a question will arise that the family of these three parties has no prime ministerial candidate
 ab agar vanshavaad ko lekar fark karne kaa yah paimaana he, to aaj to maan hi lenaa chahie, kyonki aaj shivaratri he or nilkanth ke bare main aap mujhase zyada jaanate hai
 Poison is more useful in politics than wave
 pinaa padataa he
 Congress BJP everyone
 dainik jaagran main prakashit lekh main raajnneeti shastri alen sharma ne kuch sawaal uthaae hai ki ve log kahaan hai, jo voter ke badalane or jati kii raajnneeti ke khatm hone kii baat kar rahe the
 Why Nitish, doing politics of good governance, has to bring a leader from RJD and why BJP likes Paswan? ek or raajnneeti shastri jitendra narayan ne phone par kaha ki bihar kaa yuva matadaata isse aage ja chukaa he
 He rises above caste to identify issues in which everyone has an interest
 yah isliye bhi ho rahaa he, kyonki saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai khatm ho gai he
 Jeetendra Narayan made another point that with the clean chit of the Supreme Court, Modi has not got much recognition, more than he got with Paswan
 isi baat ko alen sharma dainik jaagran ke lekh main kehete hai ki nitish kehete hai ki modi samaveshi nahin hai
 Modi questioned Nitish's claim by including Kushwaha and Paswan
 kya bihar jaat−paat ke aadhaar par hi 2014 main apane hisse kaa janadesh degaa
 If this is true, then what will the mandate mean? Alliance of castes or something

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Maldives on his first foreign trip on Saturday after being sworn in again
 maldive ne bhi pradhanmantri modi ko videshi shaksiyaton ko die jane vaale sarvocch sammaan 'rule of nishaan izzuddin' se sammanit kiya
 After being honored, PM Modi thanked Maldives and wrote, Maldives has given me the highest honor of our country and i humbly accepted it
 yah sirf meraa sammaan nahin he balki donon deshon kii dosti kaa sammaan he
 a few days ago this was not the picture of the relationship between the two countries
 pichley kuch varshon main maldive se bharat ke rishte behatar nahin rahe, isi kaa phayda uthaakar china ne maldive main acha khaasaa dabadabaa banaaya
 But after 2018 when the government changed in Maldives, there was a new initiative of relations with India
 isi rishte ko or pragadh karne ke liye piem modi maldive pahunche
 Addressed the Parliament there and spoke aggressively on the issue of terrorism
 baharhaal, piem modi ne maldive ke is daure se duusare kaarykaal main apni pehali yatra kii aupchaarikta nahin puri kii he balki unhone apane un do padosi deshon ko bhi saadh liya he jo samrik or aarthik taur par bharat ke bade pratidwandi hai
 The head of the Department of Politics at Galgotia University, Drs
 shrish pathak kehete hai ki bharat sarkaar ne sahi disha main kadam badhaayaa he
 Shrish Pathak says that it was nice to see Mohammad Nasheed sitting with the Indian Prime Minister as speaker in the Majlis (parliament) of Maldives
 pichley saal farvari main abdulla yamin kii sarkaar ne jab desh main apatkaal lagaaya tha to inhen nashid ne tab bharat sarkaar ko patr likhakar hastkshep kii maang kii thi
 Shrish Pathak remembers that Nasheed wrote this letter from Sri Lanka in self-confession
 ek jamaane main patrkaar rahe mohammad nashid maldive main un sangharshon ke aguva rahe jisase desh ko 2008 main ek nayaa loktantric samvidhan mila or usee saal gum ko chunaav main haraakar nashid desh ke pehle loktantric raashtrapati chune gaye the
 At that time there was a backlash for India because the Yameen government had full support of China and it was only a short time before India got into a tussle with China over the Doklam issue
 maldive main china ne ek chetavanee bhi de hi di thi ki aantarik maamle main koi hastkshep na kare
 He said that ultimately, the people of the country made Nasheed and Gyum-backed leader Mohammad Solih victorious in the general election
 solih kii sarkaar ne ekbar phir maldive main bharat kii paaramparik mitrataa ko maan dena shuru kiya he
 Prime Minister Modi also choosing Maldives as his first foreign trip is a strong indication that the Chinese footprint in the Indian Ocean should not be allowed to grow under any circumstances
 maldive se achche rishte rakhana bharat ke liye behad ahm he
 Because China is trying to get closer to India via Maldives
 china lagaataar maldive par apana prabhaav bana rahaa he

 a top US think-tank today said that the targeted attack on terrorists trying to sneak into India to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was done after careful assessment
 
 unhone kaha ki tanaav badhane ke liye puri tarah pakistan jimmedaar he
 "this response from India was bound to come," said Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, America's top think-tank
 yah pakistan ke liye ek sanket he or bharat ke logon ke liye ek aashwaasan he
 PM Modi cannot let go of the anger over Uri (attack)
 telis ne kaha, bharat kaa kadam saavdhaneepurvak akalan ke saath uthaaya gaya
 The purpose of attacking the terrorist launch pad was to convey the message that India has not lost its independence of retaliation, but now it is up to Pakistan to increase the tension further
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main telis ne kaha ki america sanyam kii vakaalat karegaa, lekin jab tak prashasan pakistan ke khilaaf sakhti kaa iraadaa nahin rakhata he, tab tak bharat apane khud ke hiton ke anuroop chalegaa na ki americanyon ke sahansheeltaa ke anurodhon ke anuroop
 Telis said, "I think Pakistan is still entangled and cannot respond to Indian action with military action, but the kind of war it has been doing against India so far will continue on a large scale
" centre for stritegic and international studies ke rik roso ne kaha ki pichley saal jab bhartiya sena ne myanmar main aatankiyon ke khilaaf hamalaa kiya tha, to yah aise hamalon kaa ek sanket tha
 He said, India has also shown other new ways in its tussle with Pakistan, such as not attending the upcoming SAARC conference, building strong ties with other countries of South Asia and using close security ties with the US military with Pakistan
 To reduce pressure to cooperate
 tippaniyan Rosso said that this may cause Islamabad to be very vigilant, however, when new methods are used in such a conflict, a clear message becomes important as both sides should know each other's intentions

 aatanki launch pad par hamalaa karne kaa uddeshy yah sandesh dena tha ki bharat ne javaabi karrwai kii apni aazaadee khoi nahin he, lekin tanaav ko or adhik badhaane kii jimmedaari ab pakistan par he
 In response to a question, Telles said the US would advocate restraint, but unless the administration intends to tighten up against Pakistan, India will continue to suit its own interests and not Americans' tolerance requests
 telis ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki pakistan abhi ulajhaa hua he or vah bhartiya karrwai kaa jawaab sainya karrwai se nahin de saktaa, lekin bharat ke khilaaf abhi tak jis tarah kaa yuddh vah karata aa rahaa he, vah vrihad str par jari rahegaa
 Rick Rosso of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that last year when the Indian Army launched an attack against militants in Myanmar, it was a sign of such attacks
 unhone kaha, bharat ne pakistan ke saath apni tanatani main anya nae tareeke bhi dikhaae hai, jaise aagaamee dakshes sammelan main shirkat nahin karnaa, dakshin asia ke anya deshon ke saath majboot sambandh bananaa or america ke saath kareebi suraksha sambandhon kaa istemaal pakistan ke saath sainya sahyog ghataane ke liye usapar dabaav banane ke liye karnaa
 The comments roso ne kaha ki isse islamabad ko ekadam satark rahanaa pad saktaa he haalanki jab aise sangharsh main nae tareekon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he to spasht sandesh ahm ho jaataa he kyonki donon pakshon ko ek duusare ke iraade pataa hone chahie

 Shah apologized for the delay and appealed to the people to move out of the circle of chautala-huda
 shah ne spasht kiya party rajya main INLD se gathbandhan nahin karegi or akele apane dam par jeet hasil karegi
 Beginning his address at the rally, Amit Shah said that he had left Delhi on time, but he was delayed due to the rally on the way

 Today, in the UNHRC, Pakistan and Pakistan have made allegations against India on Pakistan and Pakistan; Foreign Minister will give a statement, Secretary will give on behalf of India
 Pakistan is not leaving the issue of weakening Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir
 bharat kaa aantarik maamla hone ke baavjood pakistan is masale ko duniya ke kai manchon par uthaa chukaa he or har jagah use maat mili he
 Today once again, Jammu and Kashmir will be discussed in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on the appeal of Pakistan
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi kii aguwai main pakistan kaa ek panel is mudde ko uthayega, sabase pehle pakistani mantri bayaan denge or uske baad bharat ke sachiv unka jawaab denge
 In this discussion to be held in the 42nd session of the UNHRC, the Pakistani Foreign Minister will speak at 3 pm on Tuesday, while the Indian officials will respond after 7 pm
 aaj UNHRC main kya hoga?darasal, pakistan ne abhi tak is masale ko jahaan bhi uthaaya he vahaan use munh kii khaani padi he
 Whether it is a request from the us-russia or in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), everywhere has referred to the issue of Article 370 as India's internal issue and asked to hold bilateral talks on the problem of Jammu and Kashmir
 ab har jagah se maat khaane ke baad ek baar phir pakistan UNHRC main kadam uthaane ja rahaa he
 Pakistan's foreign minister will make his statement
 haalanki, bharat kii taraf se mantri nahin balki sachiv level ke adhikari hi jawaab denge

 kis desh kaa kisko samarthan?47 sadasyon vaale is sanghathan main pakistan kii koshish he ki muslim desh is masale par uske saath aa jaaen
 But India is far ahead of Pakistan in terms of diplomacy, so it is not going to be easy for him
 pakistan jis muslim sanghathan OIC kaa sadsy he, uske 15 sadsy UNHRC main bhi hai
 Apart from this, in such a situation, Pakistan has high expectations from these countries
 haalanki, gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki haal hi main jab pakistan ne kashmir ke masale ko OIC main uthaaya tha to use munh kii khaani padi thi
 If you talk about India, then the issue of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok), gilgit-baltistan can be raised in UNHRC on behalf of India
 bharat kii ore se sabhi 47 sadasyon se sampark kiya gaya he, jisamen china bhi shaamil he
 India is mainly supported by big countries like Norway, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czech Republic
 iske alaava iceland, switsraland or slovenia kaa bhi samarthan mil saktaa he, khaas baat ye bhi he ki abhi raashtrapati ramnath kovind inhen deshon ke daure par hai
 Apart from these countries, countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Japan, Nepal, South Africa, Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Qatar can also openly join India

 jiske haath masuumon ke khun se range hai, wahidaaood ibrahimkhud ko pradhanmantri ke baraabar taqatvar maanata he
 According to the latest tapes, he is living in Karachi city of Pakistan and is describing himself as the PM of Pakistan
 vah khud ko hi adaalat, vakil, jaj sab maanata he
 Not only does he agree but in the same way he also threatens his enemies
 daaud ibrahim kii taaja tasviren sarkaar ke paas pehle hi aa chuki hai
 Now the voice of Don has also been taped by the government spies
 sarkaar ke haath lage ek tepe main daaud kah rahaa he, ‘mere log meri ankhen or kaan hai
 That is why i get the news of the world sitting
 pradhanmantri khud galiyon main nahin ghoomte
 My words are documents
 dastavej phaade ja sakate hai, par meraa hukum nahin
 In this way Dawood threatens
 vah pakistan ke tateey shahar karachi main baithkar dhamkee de rahaa tha or uski yah aawaaj dubai main record kii gai
 Dawood Ibrahim lives comfortably in the White House building in the Clifton area of karachi under the supervision of Pakistan's military and intelligence agency ISI
 isi ghar se jab wo dubai main arabon rupee kii property kii deal kar rahaa tha to khufia agenciyon ne daaud kii live baatcheet tepe kar lee
 In this recorded call of Dawood, this mafia kingpin is not dealing with any plot, flat or bungalow, but he is making a direct deal of billions and trillions of buying and selling 8-8 multi-storey buildings in the most prized area of dubai
 Is being heard khufia agenciyon ke mutabik kareeb 1100 karod rupee kii deal main pakistan ke rasukhdaar bijnesaman ke ladke yasir ne daaud ibrahim ko gumraah kiya tha
 Dawood is heard threatening the same Yasir in this phone call

 daaud kii baton se saaf he ki pakistan main 20 saal main us par sarkari meharbaani aisi rahi ki wo khud ko pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke baraabar taqatvar maanane laga he

 But the Pakistani government kept denying it every time
 lekin phone par baatcheet ke dauraan khud daaud ne sweekaar kiya ki vah karachi ke cliffton road ke ghar main rahata he
 Islamabad's governments have always denied Dawood Ibrahim's presence in Karachi, whether Pakistan's government was in the hands of General Musharraf or Nawaz Sharif
 lekin pehali baar daaud ibrahim ne karachi main baithe-baithe kabool kiya he ki uske ghar clinfaton se saat kilometre dur downtaun ilaake main uske paas hajaar karod rupee kii property he
 Dawood Ibrahim also told the Dubai property dealer on the phone that the underworld business does not run on the contract and registry
 anderworld main karodon-arabon kii deal sirf jubaan par hoti he
 The underworld does not go to court, it just decides on the tongue
 daaud ko bharat sarkaar beete do dashak se dhund rahi he
 He is the culprit of the 1993 bomb blasts in Mumbai

 3 agast ko kendriya mantrimandal ne no ditension (fail na karne kii) niti ko radd karne ke liye shiksha ke adhikaar kanoon main sanshodhan ko manjuuri de di
 This attracted the attention of those experiments in Rajasthan which are being implemented to improve the education system in state schools

 As a result of these efforts, more than one million students have left private schools and moved to government schools

 This decision was taken in a secret meeting last month
 samay rahete suraksha balon kii tainaati, hathiyaar or prashikshan ke maddenjar bade kadam nahin uthaae gaye to halaat or bighad sakate hai
 The Maoists, who have formed their base from Pashupati in the north to Tirupati in the south, get the benefit of these attacks - they know the areas, their cadre is trained hard, they have destructive weapons and dedicated cadres

 yah aankada jammu kashmir tathaa purvottar main aatankwaad or algaavvaad se maare gaye logon kii sankhya se kaaphi adhik he
 Worse, for the last three years, the proportion of casualties in the conflict between the security forces and the Maoists is clearly tilted in favor of the Maoists
 aatankwaad virdohi abhiyaan main saamaanya taur par suraksha balon ke ek jawan ke maare jane ke badale chaar se paanch ugravadi maare jate hai

 The Home Ministry's assessment also found that in its present form, the CRPF is not in a position to successfully carry out the anti-maoist operation in dense forests
 pichley saal chhattisgarh main hue do bheeshan hamale isaki pushti karte hai
 The Home Ministry report says, "the CRPF is not fully prepared for the responsibility that will be inflicted on them and the militants will also loot their weapons

 After filing the nomination, the prospective candidates of the student organization also demonstrated strength on campus
 in chunaavon main gahamagahami itani zyada hoti he ki yah saakh kaa sawaal bhi ban jaati he
 In such a situation, the use of both power and money has also become openly
 dusu chunaav ko lekar guidelanis bhale hi jari kar di gai hon or aachaar sahinta lagu ho, par campus main niyam kanoon kii jamkar dhajjiyaan udayi ja rahi hai
 The campaign began with the announcement of the DUSU election date
 sanghathanon kii saakh daanv he lihaaja prachaar or posterbaji main koi peeche nahin rahanaa chahta
 Every wall of DU is covered with posters
 sirf diwaar hi nahin balki bench, dustbin, bijli kaa khambha, tii stall ke saath saath campus ke ird-gird kii sadaken or fliover par posters chaspa hai
 This is happening when the code of conduct has come into force
 dusu chunaav main lingadoh cameti kii siforeeshon kaa khuleam ullaghann ho rahaa he
 According to the guidelines, posters cannot be pasted anywhere in DU other than the Wall of Democracy
 jo poster chaspa hogen ve bhi handmad hone chahie
 Despite this, guidelines are openly flying not only around campus but also on campus
 daur-e-chunaav kii vajah sechaatr sanghathanon ke paas apane apane bahaane bhi taiyaar hai
 What is the National Media Convenor of ABVP? According to Saket Bahuguna, they are promoting lace paper campaign
 ye sach he ki chaatr posters laga rahe hai lekin jis tarah se har saal prachaar ke liye chaatro ko milane vaale din kam hote ja rahe hai
 In such a situation, posters are necessary to reach millions of students of 51 colleges in 2 days
 ve yah bhi chaahate hai ki har college menwal of demokrasiho taaki chaatr idhar udhar yaa saarvajanik sampatti par poster na lagaaein
 For this, they also ask to write a letter to the Election Committee
 to vahiin enesayuai ke pradesh adhyaksh akshay lakada ke mutabik enesayuai kam se kam poster lagaakar apni baat chaatro ke bich pahunchaa rahi he
 They say that no student leader intends to spoil the campus
 pabandi ke baavjood posterbajeegidelins kii andekhi kai saalon se chunaav ke dauraan dekhne ko milti rahi he
 Therefore, the Election Commission has assigned a team of six videographers to monitor all the organizations
 chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke saath hi campus main chaatr sanghathanon ke kaaryakartaaon kii alag alagagatividhiyon kii recordingbhi kii ja rahi he
 Despite this, there is no action on student organizations and candidates who disobey the guidelines
 chunaav samiti kii maane to jab tak nomination final nahin hote tab tak ection nahin liya ja saktaa
 This is because the university does not mark any student organization
 haalanki diu prashasan ne sakhti baratate hue poster lagane waalon par aapraadhik maamla darj karne ke saath hi aaropee ummidavaaron kaa namakan radd karne kaa bhi faisla kiya he
 The No Poster Party is also painted in the color of politics in the campus amidst active-anti-transplant
 aane vaale dinon main prachaar or tej hoga
 In such a situation, where there is continued posterity from the student organizations
 vahiin duusari taraf diu ke students 'no poster party' campan chalaa rahe hai
 Four students of Miranda House started a campaign to remove posters from DU by creating a page on Facebook
 dekhte hi dekhte kareeb 80 walantier bhi is muhim main judate chale gaye
 Now these students are busy cleaning up the campus
 miranda house kii chaatra marya ke mutabik dusu chunaav ke dauraan campus kii sirf deevaaren nahin balki har ek cheez par poster chipka rahata he
 Sign boards are also covered with posters
 iske maddenjar ve campus ko clin kar rahe hai
 They will continue their no poster party campaign during DUSU and even after DUSU
 campus main pasra kachra diu main padhane vaale chaatro ko bhi raas nahin aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, many students are also preparing to boycott DUSU elections
 aapako bataa den ki dusu chunaav 12 sitambar ko hone hai
 The names of the candidates will be finalized on September 6
 7 sitambar se chunaav prachaar jor pakadega
 The results will be announced on 13 September
 is saal board imtihaan ke vakt laudspikaron ke istemaal par lagane vaali pabandi hatane or holi kaa hullad shuru hote hi pashchim bengal main chunavi tapish charam par hogi
 But the political stir has already intensified
 bijepi ne malda kii hinsa par centre sarkaar se lekar raashtrapati bhawan tak alakh jagaakar dhruvikaran kii bisaat bicha di he
 Former Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya publicly advocated alliances with the Congress as part of a strategy to give a tough fight to the ruling party Trinamool Congress
 lekin saadhe teen dashak tak sipiem kaa garh rahe pashchim bengal main 2011 main trinmul congress kii supremeo mamata banerjee ne jis tarah 'poribortan' kii aandhi bahaakar takhtapalat kar diya tha, centre main pehali baar bahumat kii sarkaar banane vaali bijepi bhi 2015 main 'poribortan' ke khilaaf nayaa parivartan kaa naaraa buland karke kuch vaise hi karishma karne kaa sapana sanjoe baithi he
 Behind this is the thinking of BJP national president Amit Shah that the wave of change is flowing after Modi's rule, Mission Bengal is a key link in this
 shah kaa maananaa he ki party kii asli jeet tab hogi, jab bengal main bhagava dhvaj laharaayega
 34 years became 39 years 'poribortan' Noi collapse, and 34 years became 39 years
 ye do naare hi do maheene baad hone vaale pashchim bengal vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi ke abhiyaan ke mukhya bindu honge
 In this, the BJP will say that the Left government, which ruled continuously for 34 years, kept the state bereft of development, then the five-year rule of Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee, who came to power in the name of 'poribortan', has also proved to be part of the same link
 
 'poribortan' ke khilaaf nayaa parivartan kaa naaraa buland karke bijepi pashchim bengal main trinmul congress ke vikalp ke taur par ubharna chaahati he
 Currently this place is near the Left Front
 rajya main mukhyamantri mamata banerjee kii jamini lokapriyata se waakif bijepi ke ranneetikaar yah maanakar chal rahe hai ki vidhansabha chunaav main mudda mamata or unka kaamkaaj hi rahane vaala he isliye unako chunauti bijepi yaa vam morche se milegi
 In view of this, the bjp's objective is to emerge as Mamata's defiant opponent
 dhruvikaran kii bisatbihar main gomance ke mudde par dhruvikaran kii koshish bhale aundhe munh giri ho, lekin pashchim bengal main bijepi ek baar phir dhruvikaran kii disha main badhati dikh rahi he
 However, strategists believe that there cannot be a polarization of hindu-muslim votes in West Bengal on the basis of communalism like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
 isliye party naram hindutv kii ranneeti par aage bad rahi he, jiske tahat mamata banerjee sarkaar ke rashtriya suraksha se khilwaad ko mudda bana rahi he
 Recently, the manner in which the mob attacked on behalf of idara-e-sharia at Kaliachak in Malda on January 3, BJP has made it an election issue
 pehle shah ne teen sadasyeey cameti banaakar malda bheja lekin mamata sarkaar ne us team ko malda railway stesan se hi jabaran waapas bhej diya
 Thereafter, the delegation led by the state BJP general secretary in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya sought to interfere with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and President Pranab Mukherjee
 malda hi nahin, bangladesh seemaa se sate aise sabhi ilaakon main bijepi taskari, avaidh hathiyaaron kii supplai, jaali karency jaise muddon ko uthaane ja rahi he jisase sthaneey janata peedit he
 As part of the strategy of polarization of Hindu votes, a strategy has been made to organize refugee conferences in the border districts
 bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv or rajya ke sah-prabharee siddharth nath singh kehete hai, ''ghuspaithiye or sharnaarthi main fark he
 a bill is pending in Parliament to provide protection to Bangladeshi refugees
 ham 21 se 29 farvari tak seemaa se jude jilon main sharnaarthi sammelan karenge
 In these conferences, the Mamta government will be accused of protecting illegal activities happening in the border areas and an attempt will be made to surround it
 haalanki haal hi main 8-9 janvari ko kolkata main yojit global bijness summit main jis tarah kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali, sadak parivahan mantri nitin gadakari, urja mantri piyush goyal ne mamata sarkaar kii tarif kii thi, usase sthaneey ikai main duvidha paidaa ho gai thi
 The party later tried to control the damage by vigorously raising the violence of Malda
 cheharaa banaam vikaas kaa agendabijepi yah maanakar chal rahi he ki mukhyamantri mamata banerjee chunaav kii mukhya dhuree hongi, lekin asli ladaai unhen kadi takkar dene kii he jiske liye vam morcha or bijepi main hode he
 Shah said in a public meeting held near Victoria Memorial during the Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections last year, "just as Modi ji achieved the goal of Congress-free India, now we want Trinamool-free Bengal
" janata ne sipiem ko mauka diya, phir 2011 main mamata ko laakar badlaav kiya lekin unhone kya kiya sabhi ko maaloom he
 Now the people should give an opportunity to BJP so that Modi ji can advance the development agenda in the state
 ''bhale bijepi mamata kaa majboot vikalp hone kaa dambh bhar rahi ho, lekin uski mushkil yah he ki dow
 After Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, the party in Bengal did not have a face whose name could be redeemed
 netaji subhaashachandr bose se jude rahasyon ko saarvajanik karne kii pahal kar party bengal main paith bananaa chaahati he
 Therefore, the party has decided to enter the election summer without any face
 siddharth nath singh kehete hai, ''pashchim bengal kii janata ko yah chunanaa he ki use cheharaa (mamata) chahie yaa narendra modi ke vikaas kaa agenda
 Before raising this slogan, BJP has prepared a concrete strategy to surround Mamta
 kanoon-vyavastha or sharada chitfund ghotaale jaise bhrashtachar ke muddon par bijepi mamata sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa karegi
 According to sources, the CBI investigating the Saradha chit fund case may increase activity before the election
 agar sibiai is maamle main andeh ke ghere main aae trinmul ke kuch netaaon par shikanja kasati he to chunaav se pehle bijepi manovaigyanik badhat lene kii koshish karegi
 Apart from this, issues like law and order attack on police-administration, beating of students and professors in universities, plight of farmers are also on the agenda of the party
 rajya bijepi ke purv adhyaksh or rashtriya sachiv rahul sinha kehete hai, ''ham sidhe janata tak pahunch rahe hai, bengal kii janata mamata sarkaar kii asaliyat ko samaj gai he
 The young man is understanding that the BJP is the better option
 hamaara naaraa hoga ki centre or rajya main ek hi party kii sarkaar hogi to soobe kaa teji se vikaas hoga
 "new equations began to emerge
 As soon as the stirring of the assembly elections, new political equations are also emerging in the province
" sipiem kii ore se congress ke saath najdiki ke sanket se bijepi satark ho gai he
 However, BJP believes that if there is a Left front-congress alliance, then BJP will benefit because the Muslim vote will be divided
 duusari taraf 34 saal ke vam morcha shashan ke samay se hi donon partiyon ke kaaryakartaaon kii dushmani gahari he jo is gathbandhan ko kabool nahin kar paaenge
 Even before the Bihar elections, BJP strategists used to make similar arguments when a merger / alliance was being initiated between Lalu and Nitish
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main mili vot pratishat ko jodakar bihar main mahagathbandhan aage nikal gaya tha
 In Bengal too, if there is a left-congress alliance, the vote share of both is 39
 64 fisadi hota he jo trinmul congress ko mili vot 39
 Reaches close to 79 per cent
 aise main loksabhaa chunaav main 17
 The BJP, which secured 02 per cent of the vote, will have a dream of reaching number two in Bengal
 vidhansabha ke bahaane 2019 kii ranneetibijapi bengal main apana pair jamaane ko har jatan kar rahi he, lekin hakeekat se waakif bijepi ke varisht ranneetikaron ke mutabaki, nateezon ke bare main spasht anumaanon ke baavjood party puri takat se vidhansabha chunaav ladegi
 According to sources, the BJP is seeing a decrease in the increase it was seeing in Bengal after the Lok Sabha elections
 isaki pushti kolkata nagar nigam chunaav nateezon se hui
 When Amit Shah himself learned the Bengali language in November 2014, he himself campaigned for the municipal elections, he hoped that the party would get more seats from the Left Front in the local elections, which are considered semi-final of the assembly
 lekin jab april 2015 main nattejey aae to trinmul congress ne kul 144 main se pichhali baar kii 95 siton ke mukaable 114 siten jiti, jabaki vam morcha 33 se ghatakar 15 siton par aa gaya
 bjp's seats rose from 3 to 7, but could not become the number two party
 isliye bijepi ne bengal ke liye dirghakaalik ranneeti banaai
 BJP is working to increase vote percentage more than seats in assembly elections
 isaki vajah he—2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav
 According to BJP strategists, the party has done well in its constituencies where there is no scope to increase anything now
 lihaaja, party nae garh kii talash main he taaki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main centre kii satta se maharoom na hona pade
 The party believes that from now on, if the party reaches the ground in Bengal, then its direct benefit will be given in the general election
 tathy yah bhi he ki loksabhaa main bengal main bijepi ko unheen halkon main zyada vot mili jahaan mazdooree yaa kaarobaar karne gaye upi-bihar yaa hindi bhashi rajyon ke log zyada hai or us vakt modi lahar thi
 BJP does not have many candidates to try to increase organizational base, but the state unit has asked Prime Minister Modi to take time for 10 rallies
 chunaav kii drushti se rajya ko saat cluster main baantkar ranneeti banaai ja rahi he
 The booths are divided into three categories — the first one has around 60,000 booths where the party claims to have a team of 10–15 workers
 jabaki baaki 14 hajaar boothon par vahaan sthiti kamjor he, jo atisamvedansheel or muslim bahul maane jate hai
 Bengal is the state where mic-loudspeakers are banned for a whole month due to board exams
 isliye bijepi ne janvari main hi chaar badi reliyon ke saath chunaav kaa aagaaj kar diya he
 In February, the party's full emphasis will be on organizational preparedness
 11 farvari se 20 farvari tak booth sammelan hoga jisamen kendriya netaaon ke saath rajya-jila str ke netaa bhi shaamil honge
 Whereas there will be a legislative conference from 21 to 29 February
 march ke pehle hafte main chunaav kii adhisuchana jari hone kii sambhaavna he
 The party has created three categories in terms of seats
 294 siton main se 165 e to 45 bi or baaki 84 siten si shrenee main he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the party had an edge in the 26 Legislative Assembly, while it lost in a close contest in about 60 seats
 bengal main chunaav main dhaandhlee behad aam he, so, party chunaav ayog se guhaar lagaakar sabhi siton par vivipieti (vot kii pushti karne vaali print) takanic lagane kii baat kar rahi he
 Fearing violence, the BJP has also formed a legal team to assist in every assembly
 jaahir he, bengal main bijepi ke paas ganvaane ko kuch nahin he
 The BJP has a chance to expand the organization by gaining a few seats
 sawaal he ki kya
 Will BJP succeed in its plan? santakruj main 72 varshiya ek artiai kaaryakarta kii najadik se goli markar hatya kar di gai

 rajasthan royles or royal chalangers bangalore ke bich khelaa gaya pehla muqabla barish kii bhent chadh gaya tha
 The two teams will face face-to-face again under the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Wednesday

 Gayle, who has scored two centuries in five matches so far in the IPL, will obviously be a big challenge for Shane Warne's team but an even bigger challenge Warne will have to deal with at home

 There is a possibility of fundamental improvement in this matter
 rajasthan royles ne ab tak kul 11 match khele hai
 He has lost in five while he has won in as many matches

 In the event of losing to Rajasthan Royals, this team may slip to fifth position in the table but for this Rajasthan Royals will have to win by a big margin
 gail ke aane ke baad se danniel vittori kii team kaa aatmavishvaas saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya he
 In such a situation, it is very difficult for the Rajasthan Royals to beat him, but given Warne's last IPL season, his teammates will try their best to win the remaining three matches

 The story of the Joshi couple is a glimpse of the dark side of the Indian bureaucracy where corrupt and powerful people escape punishment due to a never ending screw-by-screw process
 charchaaen hai ki kuch rasukhdaar netaaon or vyapaaree gharaanon se inke kareebi rishte hai
 Apart from Income Tax Department, the couple also had to go through the investigation of Enforcement Directorate (ED), Lokayukta and former Chief Secretary Nirmala Buch
 in sabhi ne donon ko doshi paaya
 Moreover, during the investigation into the Vectra defense procurement deal, the CBI came to know that the couple had a close relationship with Vectra chairman Ravindra Rishi

 Investigations indicated that Arvind Joshi, who was the Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Defense between 1999-2004, gave Rishi access to the Ministry

 The list of properties of Joshi couple is long and shocking

 In the 7,000-page report submitted to Navelkar, the Income Tax Department has given the complete details of where the money of Joshi couple has been invested
 report ke mutabik, joshi dampati ne kanha or bandhavgarh neshnal park samet raisen, balaghat, sihor or bhopal main kheti or bina kheti vaali jameen bade paimaane par kharid rakhi thi
 He had also purchased 25 flats, out of which 18 were in Kamrup Housing Society of Guwahati
 inke chah flats bhopal or ek flats dilli main tha
 The report claimed that between 2007 and 2010, Arvind invested Rs 270 crore in speculative activities and futures trading in the stock market
 laga rakhe the
 The process of sacking these people started when Nirmala Butch's report submitted to Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan once again showed that the IAS couple had amassed disproportionate assets
 rajya sarkaar ne diopiti se 23 janvari, 2013 ko inaki barkhaastagi kii sifarish kar di
 But in doing so, Chief Minister Chouhan took a lot of time
 unhone 18 aktubar, 2012 ko hi joshi dampati kii barkhaastagi kii ghoshnaa kar di thi
 Shivraj had then claimed that the IAS couple's dismissal recommendation from the state government would be sent to the central government soon
 lekin diopiti ko yah sifarish karne main rajya sarkaar ko do maheene lag gaye
 Now that the Joshi couple are trying hard to save themselves, it is difficult to say how long it will take for the case to reach a logical conclusion
 clerk or chaparaasiyon ke bhrashtachar ke maamalon main unki sampatti par kabja kar lene vaala empi kaa lokayukta daftar is iees dampati ke aage laachaar he
 Who is responsible for the delay? It is really surprising that so many agencies have laid siege to Joshi couple but they have not been able to punish them both
 lokayukta police ne joshi dampati ke sarkari nivas par chapa 10 disambar, 2010 ko hi maaraa tha lekin use apni jaanch puri karne main 18 maah se bhi zyada samay lag gaya
 "we had completed our investigation only on July 16, 2012," says an officer associated with the investigation
 ”8 aktubar, 2012 ko lokayukta police ne is prabhaavshaalee dampati ke khilaaf bhrashtachar nivaaran adhinium (pisie) ke tahat maamla chalaane ke liye diopiti se anumati maangi, lekin use lambey samay tak isaki ijaajat nahin mili
 It is clear that the central government did not want to speed up the matter
 lokayukta police ke iji ashok avasthi bataate hai, ''joshi dampati ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye ham to centre se anumati kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The dopt recently signed the dismissal file of the IAS couple and sent it to the UPSC
 ab lokayukta police ko bhi ummid he ki ab unhen jald hi joshi dampati ke khilaaf mukadmaa chalaane kaa adhikaar mil jayega
 The ED has not yet initiated action against Joshi under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)
 ek iskar adhikari khij main kehete hai, ''mujhe samaj nahin aa rahaa ki idi vaale is dampati ke khilaaf maamla chalaane se dar kyon rahe hai?” lekin idi kii apni daleelein hai

 On the same lines, money for Indian babus originates from files

 If industrialists can succeed in stealing tax, influencing policies and making money in questionable ways, then why should Babu, who moves the files, not get a part of this loot

 Where and how do they get this money? The Babu people make their way to it

 This is probably the reason for the Joshi couple not being dismissed yet

 But after a raid at home, the couple, who were spending the day in seclusion, no longer have a crowd of friends
 kuch thekedaar aate jate hai, jo pehle kaam se unke paas aate the
 The couple, who have been happy with each other before, have had a rift because according to people close to them, Tinnu blasts her husband's head for this humiliating situation and declares himself innocent

 Many friends and close friends have made a distance from him

 However, Arvind refrained from speaking anything on any matter related to him or his wife, saying that all this is under consideration in the court, so no one can comment

 a case was registered on his complaint, but Arvind's hair was not deterred due to strong political contacts

 Cricket is like religion in our country, and there is always pressure on the players to perform well, but now the pressure on Team India players is seen to increase some more
 
 
 enditivi india ko sutron ke hawaale se mili jaankaree ke mutabik ab bhartiya cricket niyantran board (bisisiai) sirf un khilaadiyon ke saath salanaa contract kiya karegaa, jo team main ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 
 
 It has been reported that BCCI will keep only two grades 'A' and 'B' instead of 'A', 'B' and 'C' in the coming days, along with the number of players to be contracted under these grades
 Will also be reduced beforehand
 
 
 so, saaf-saaf kaha jaae, to ab nae system main khilaadiyon ke kaam ko tavajjo milegi, naam ko nahin
 
 
 Currently, the contracted players in 'A' grade are paid Rs 1 crore annually, and this grade includes players like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan
 
 
 'bi' grad ke khilaadiyon ko 50 lakh rupee salanaa milte hai, or is grad main philhal harbhajan singh, cheteshwar pujaara, rohit sharma, irfan khan or umesh yadav jaise khilaadi shaamil hai
 
 
 Currently, 20 players who are contracted under third grade 'C' are given Rs 25 lakh annually
 
 
 sutron ke mutabik, bisisiai ab kul 20 khilaadiyon ko hi vaarshik qaraar dene kaa man bana rahi he
 
 
 It has been reported that in fact, the Board believes that most of the players are part of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and they get a significant amount from their team owners
 
 
 so, agar khilaadi graded pement list se baahar ho jaaenge to apane pradarshan main sudhaar kar ve team main apni jagah pakki karne ke liye zyaada kadi mehnat karenge
 
 
 While a grade of three to two may fall on some players' heads, there is now a good news for the players to be contracted
 
 
 sutron ke anusaar, 'e' grad main shaamil khilaadiyon ko is baar ek kii jagah dedh karod rupee or 'bi' grad main anubandhit khilaadiyon ko 50 lakh ke sthaan par 75 lakh se lekar ek karod rupee tak kii rakam di ja sakati he
 
 
 The comments bisisiai kii chennai main hone ja rahi salanaa vaarshik baithak main is nae grading system par shaayad muhar lag jaaegi
 
 
 By the way, according to sources, the new system has nothing to do with the board coffers, rather it is an attempt to make the players work hard, and stay on top
 
 
 udhar, ab zikr karenge, un khilaadiyon kaa, jinaki chuttee lagbhag tay maani ja rahi he
 
 
 Under the current contracts, there are many players who have played only a few matches for Team India in the last one year, so their leave is fixed, because now the BCCI is going to scissor on the annual contract amount given to the players, And only the players are willing to adopt, whose bat is constantly speaking, or whose balls the opposition batsmen are drooling
 
 
 jin khilaadiyon ke naam grading list se katane tay maane ja rahe hai, unamem virendra sahvaag, gautam gambhir, irfan pathan, munaf patel, lakshmipathi balaji, yusuf pathan, robin uthppa, es badrinaath or praveen kumaar jaise khilaadi shaamil ho sakate hai

 While on the one hand, grades three to two may fall on some players' heads, now there is a good news for the players to be unbolted
 
 
 sutron ke anusaar, 'e' grad main shaamil khilaadiyon ko is baar ek kii jagah dedh karod rupee or 'bi' grad main anubandhit khilaadiyon ko 50 lakh ke sthaan par 75 lakh se lekar ek karod rupee tak kii rakam di ja sakati he
 
 
 The comments bisisiai kii chennai main hone ja rahi salanaa vaarshik baithak main is nae grading system par shaayad muhar lag jaaegi
 
 
 By the way, according to sources, the new system has nothing to do with the board coffers, rather it is an attempt to make the players work hard, and stay on top

 According to sources, the BCCI is now planning to give a total of 20 players to the annual contract
 
 
 bataaya gaya he ki darasal, board kaa maananaa he ki zyaadaatar khilaadi indian premier lig (ipel) kaa hissaa hai or unhen apane team maalikon se acchhee-khaasi rakam milti hi he
 
 
 So, if the players get out of the graded payment list, they will work harder to improve their performance in the team by improving their performance
 
 
 vaise jahaan ek ore teen se do grad kiya janaa kuch khilaadiyon ke sir par gaaj banakar gir saktaa he, vahiin ab anubandhit kiye jane vaale khilaadiyon ke liye ek khushkabari bhi he
 
 
 According to sources, this time the players who are in 'A' grade can be given Rs 1
5 crore instead of one and the contracted players in 'B' grade can be given Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore instead of 50 lakh
 
 
 tippaniyan The new grading system will probably be stamped at the annual meeting of the BCCI to be held in Chennai
 
 
 vaise, sutron ke mutabik nae system kaa board kii tijori se kuch lenaa-dena nahin, balki yah is baat kii koshish he ki khilaadi lagaataar mehnat karen, or top par bane rahen
