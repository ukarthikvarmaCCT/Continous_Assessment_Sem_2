 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said today that the Reserve Bank's move to increase short-term policy rates will help in controlling inflation without affecting economic growth
 mukherjee ne yahaan sansad bhawan parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘mujhe ummid he ki maudrik niti main kiye gayi badlaavon se pehle se ghat rahi mudrasphiti main or narmi aayegi saath hi yah hamen aarthik vruddhi ke raste par banaaye rakhegi
 In the First Quarter Review of Credit and Monetary Policy, the Reserve Bank today gave short-term borrowings, ie repo rate 0, to banks
 25 pratishat badhkar 5
 75% and short term amount to be taken from banks i
e
 reverse repo rate 0
 50 pratishat badhkar 4
 50 percent
 mukherjee ne kaha, ‘rigerv bank dwaara pesh maudrik niti soch samajhakar sahi disha main uthyaa gaya ek or kadam he, rigerv bank ne na keval nitigat daron main vruddhi kii he balki is vruddhi ke saath bank ne repo or reverse repo daron ke bich ke faasale ko bhi kam kiya he isse adhik sakasham vittiya pranali banane main madad milegi
 Expressing satisfaction over going on keeping the CRR rate constant, Mukherjee said, "I am happy that the CRR rate was not increased, because the pressure on the banking system was increased due to payment of bids for 3G spectrum
" ’ calendar varsh main repo or reverse repo dar main chauthi baar vruddhi kii gai he
 Earlier, the central bank had a cash reserve ratio (CRR) of 0 on 29 January
 75 pratishat vruddhi kar ise 5
 75 percent
 bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) aaj byaaj daron ko badhaane or ghataane ko lekar apane faisle kii ghoshnaa karegaa
 Earlier many economists have expressed the possibility that RBI will increase the repo rate this time
 vahiin, kai iconomists kaa kahana he ki is baar bhi kendriya bank byaaj daron main koi badlaav nahin karegaa
 What decision the Reserve Bank of India takes regarding interest rates, it will be clear only after noon
 lekin agar arabiai repo rate main badhotaree karata he, to isse aapaki jeb par asar padana tay he
 Increasing the repo rate will make it expensive for you to borrow from banks and your EMI will also increase
 repo rate badhanaper aapaki jeb par padane vaale asar ko samajhane ke liye sabase pehle aapako ye jaananaa hoga ki repo rate hota kya he
 What is Repo Rate? Repo rate is the rate at which banks take loans from RBI
 darasal jab bhi bainkon ke paas fund kii kami hoti he, to ve isaki bharpai karne ke liye kendriya bank se paise lete hai
 This loan given by RBI is available at a fixed rate
 yahi rate repo rate kehalaata he
 It is decided by the Reserve Bank of India
 repo rate kyon badhaata he arabiai?bhartiya rigerv bank repo rate main katautee yaa badhotaree karne kaa faisla maujuuda or bhavishya main arthvyavastha ke sambhavit halaat ke aadhaar par letaa he
 The central bank increases the repo rate at most times when inflation in the country remains under pressure
 aise main ise niyantran main laane ke liye repo rate ahm saadhan banataa he
 The increase in repo rate by RBI helps in controlling inflation
 jab bhi arabiai repo rate badhaata he, to bank usase kam karj lete hai
 Due to this, money supply is less in circulation
 isse mahangaai par niyantran paane main madad milti he
 This effect on you is the increase in the repo rate means that the funds that banks will take from RBI, they will get it at expensive rates
 isse bainkon par dabaav badhata he
 To reduce their burden, banks pass it on to customers
 yah boj aapke saath mahange karj or badi hui iemai ke taur par baanta jaataa he
 For this reason, whenever the repo rate increases, it becomes expensive for you to take a loan
 agar kam hua to
 
 
 If the repo rate is low, it is cheaper for banks to raise funds from the RBI
 isse bank apane graahakon ko saste main karj dene ke liye prerit hote hai
 They cut interest rates after reducing the repo rate
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki buudhvaar ko bhartiya rigerv bank aapako saste karj kaa tohfa detaa he yaa phir aapke liye lone lenaa mahangaa hoga
 The possibility is also being expressed that no change will be made in the repo rate like the last three times
 ek ladki ke yon utpeedan cese main fanse asaram kii musiibat or badhane vaali he
 Now the codewords which Asaram used to speak in front of people, but no outsider could understand
 asaram ke kodewards or uske matlab par daaliye ek najar
 
 
 1
 dial 400:police jaanch main yah baat saamne ai he ki '400 lagaao' kaa matlab hota tha asaram se mobile par baat karnaa
 It is said about Asaram that he does not keep mobile, but the reality is that he keeps mobile
 darasal, asaram ke mobile number kaa aakhri 3 ank he '400'
 This mobile used to be the cook of Asaram
 rasoiyaa jab bhi badalata tha, wo nae rasoiyon ko '400' saunp jaataa tha
 The cook was allowed to pick up the phone, not to talk
 is phone ko asaram ke alawa koi bhi apane kaan se nahin laga saktaa tha
 The cook's duty was to receive the phone and put it on Asaram's ear
 shiva, shilpi yaa sharatchand ko jab bhi asaram se phone par baat karnaa hota tha, wo bas yahi kehete the ki 400 lagaao yaa 400 par baat ho gai he or kaam puraa karne kaa nirdesh mila he
 Police investigation has revealed that all the accused in the case, Shilpi, Shiva and Sharat Chandra are talking on 400 only
 yani asaram ko har nai jaankaree di ja rahi he
 On 6 August, Shilpi explained to the victim that she is possessed by ghosts and that Asaram can cure her
 usee din se 400 kii ghanti ghanaghanani shuru ho gai
 On August 16, the last day of the crime, on 400, the other accused in the case, Shilpi, Shiva and Sharatchandra, kept talking among themselves
 jaanch main police ne may, june or july kii 400 kii kol detail saboot ke taur par pesh kii he, jisamen bataaya gaya he ki is number par teenon aropiyon kii kabhi baatcheet nahin hoti thi
 But from the day of plotting till the victim's departure from Madai Ashram, 400 calls were received from the three Shilpi, Shiva and Sharatchand

 Surrender: Whenever a girl liked Asaram, the servants were ordered to surrender
 ladki ek baar samarpan ke liye taiyaar ho jaae, to use baapu ke paas akele main milane ke liye bheja jaataa tha
 After the girl was dedicated to Asaram there, she was called to the Ahmedabad ashram
 is ladki ne bhi police or magistrate ko die bayaan main kaha he ki uske biimaar hone ke tatkaal baad chhindwara ashram ke nideshak sharatchand ne use apane offis main bulaayaa or samajhaayaa ki sadhvi ban jaao or baba ke liye khud ko samarpit ho jaao
 After this, he was not allowed to sleep overnight
 ek ladki ke saath baitaakar anushthan karaayaa gaya
 Not only this, the victim told that Asaram had said the same before he was caught in the hut in the dark and seduce him, "what will you do as a CA, surrender
" padhane-likhane main acchhee he
 Will make a good speaker, preach
 ' asaram samarpan karaanevaali ladki kaa chunaav khud karte the or lagata tha ki baat ban jaaegi, to phir jimmedaari shilpi kii hoti thi ki wo samarpan karaae
 According to the victim's statements, Asaram first met her in Haridwar's ashram in may-june 2012, and then she put her hands 'in the wrong places'
 tab peedita ne yah samajhakar virodh nahin kiya ki ek pita apane beti ke sharir par haath rakhaa he
 Asaram mistook this gesture as consent and reached Chhindwara in January 2013
 vahaan par sharat chand se baat kii or march 2013 main shilpi ko chhindwara ashram kii warden banaakar bhej diya, taaki shilpi asaram ke iraadon ko anjaam dilava sake
 Even though Asaram's lentils did not turn up, but when the victim's family started moving from the hut, Asaram did not agree and asked to bring the victim to Ahmedabad
 iske baad asaram ke bete narayan sami par aarope lagane vaali indore kii mahila ne bhi asaram par aarope lagaaya he ki jab wo 200 main asaram se ajmer main mili thi, to shaam ne akele main use bulaakar haath pakadakar kaha tha ki tu shaadi karke kya karegi, samarpan kar de
 3
 nayaa naam:asaram apane paas aanevaali ladki ko kabhi bhi uske naam se nahin pukaarte the
 He also gave the victim a new name 'jatti'
 asaram peedita ko isi naam se bulaata the
 Earlier, Asaram also named Sanchita Gupta as 'shilpi' and in the ashrams she was known as 'shilpi'
 4
 Torchlight: Asaram lives alone in the hut of meditation
 ve apane paas torch rakhte hai
 Asaram keeps it dark in the hut of meditation
 kisi ko bhi bulaanaa ho, to aawaaj dekar bulaane kii bajaae torch kii roshni se hi bulaate hai
 Even in this shanty, the victim said that she went through the back door and closed the front door, then darkened the room
 iske baad asaram andar jaakar torch kii roshni se ishaara karke use andar bulaayaa

 sonia ne kaha ki rajya main udyogon kii sthiti dayaneey ho gai he or centre sarkaar udyogon ko badhaava dene ke liye prayasarat he
 The Congress President said that UP was given a package of crores of rupees from the Center but the State Government did not use it properly
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe purvanchal ke logon se hamadardi he or varanasi main congress kii jaden puraani he
 Referring to the Bhatta Parsaul case of Greater Noida, Sonia said that there is a conspiracy to grab land in UP
 unhon ne kaha ki yahaan kisaanon par julm dhaaya gaya or sarkari tantra kaa durupyog kiya gaya
 Calling party workers, Sonia said that now the Congress will not tolerate the atrocities in UP

 dilli sarkaar ke 21 sansadeey sachivon ko raksha kavach pradaan karne ke virodh main congress adaalat jane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Delhi Pradesh Congress President Ajay Maken on Monday accused the Delhi government of acting against the rules and strongly criticized Kejriwal
 abhi kuch hi din beete honge jab dilli kii aap sarkaar ne apane21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv niyukt kiya, lekin ab sarkaar ne ek kadam aage badhate hue bajet satr main sanshodhit bill paas kar diya
 The Congress has once again opened its front and has targeted Kejriwal fiercely
 maakan ke mutabik kejariwal kevidhayamb or bhi aage badhanaa chaahate hai or isliye kahin wo asantusht naa rah jaaen to unhone apane 21 vidhayakon ko sansadeey sachiv bana diya, jo sahin nahin he
 Maken said that electing 21 mlas as parliamentary secretary is a kind of corruption and violation of law
 vidhayakon ko prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ke saath jane se rokane ke liye mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne unhen sansadeey sachiv bana diya, jisase unhen mantriyon ke baraabar suvidhaayen mil saken
 This is illegal and the membership of legislators who become Parliamentary Secretaries may be canceled, so the Lt
 Governor should not approve it before the PIL is decided
 congress ke mutabik pehle kanoon tha ki sansadeey sachiv mukhyamantri ke saath banaae jate the na ki mantriyon ke saath
 The Kejriwal government amended this law by adding ministers with the Chief Minister and implemented it from February 14, 2015, so that the membership of 21 of its mlas could not be canceled
 ab se pehle sirf janhit main hi koi kanoon pichhali taarikh se paarit hua he
 Therefore, Kejriwal should tell that what was the public interest in the law passed by his government? All these mlas should resign on the basis of morality

 At the behest of terrorist bosses, Adil Ahmed Dar has responded to what the Adil Ahmad Dar did by carrying out the terror attack in Pulwama
 ye jajba jahaan desh kii suraksha agenciyon ke liye raahat lekar aayaa he
 At the same time, this will be a problem for the enemies of the country
 kyonki kashmir ke ye noujvaan is baar apane gharon se desh par mar mit jane ke liye qatari banaakar nikle hai
 a relief picture has emerged in Kashmir after the Pulwama attack
 jisamen hajaaron kashmiri noujvaan khud ko bhatakane se bachaate hue dikh rahe hai
 After this, the Kashmiris now have to decide whether they want to wander or be embellished
 wo adil ahamed daar kii tarah marakar gharavaalon ke liye shame kaa sabab banenge yaa jaanbaaj nisaar ahamed kii tarah shahid hokar unhen garv karne kaa mauka denge
 Recently, Dhillon, a senior army officer, appealed, 'mothers have an important role in the society of Kashmir
 main kashmir kii sabhi maataaon se apil karnaa chahta hum ki wo apane bacchon se kahen jinhone aatankwaad apana liya he ki wo sarender karen or mukhyadhara main lauten
 'actually, India wants to give an opportunity to every young man of Kashmir who has gone astray
 varanaa itihaas gavaah he ki jisane desh ke khilaaf bandook uthaai wo maaraa gaya
 Now the army has a list of thousands of young people who want to live for the country
 varanaa bhartiya sena ke paas un logon kii list bhi he, jo dushmano ke liye ji rahe the or buree maut maare gaye
 None of them survived
 phir bhale wo burhan ho, kamran ho yaa phir gaazi
 Therefore, in order to save themselves from being killed like a Burhan, Ghazi or Kamran and to embarrass their families, these thousands of Kashmiri youth have chosen the path of sarcasm
 ab ye naa sirf mulk ke liye jeena chaahate hai balki marane ko bhi taiyaar hai
 Standing in the queue of recruitment, these Kashmiri youth are announcing that they will not allow any Adil Ahmed Dar or terrorists sitting across the border to pollute their valley
 ab ye noujvaan kashmiriat ke sir ko jhukne nahin denge
 Perhaps this is the reason that the Baramulla, which is considered a stronghold of terrorists, has set such a large number of Kashmiri youths not only to join the Indian Army, but also set an example
 balki desh ke dushmano ko kadaa paigaam bhi bheja he
 After the Pulwama attack, the questions on the patriotism of Kashmiris started to be raised on social media
 lekin sena main bhartee ke liye lagi bheed bataa rahi he ki kashmiriyon ke dil main abhi bhi hindustan dhadkta he
 And if it had not happened, more than 3 thousand local Kashmiri youth would not have been recruited to recruit 111 soldiers in the Indian Army

 1- If you have to use eggs to make a baking product, then it is better not to keep them in the fridge
 2
 If you have noticed, after buying and bringing the eggs to boil immediately, they do not burst, but when the eggs are kept in the fridge they boil
 3
 Keeping the egg in the refrigerator leads to condensation which increases the speed of bacteria present on the egg peel and it can be dangerous to consume such eggs
 4
 Many times dirt remains on the upper part of the egg, it can also infect other things of the refrigerator
 5
 It is true that eggs kept in the fridge last longer than the eggs laid out, but due to too much cold in the fridge, the nutrients of the eggs are destroyed

 rithik ne khud maansik avsaad (depressant) kaa saamana karne kii baat bhi maani he
 But Hrithik has also said that depression is not something that can be seen as a bad thing
 rithik ne kaha ki maansik swasthya se jude muddon par saamaanya taur par hi baat kii jaani chahie
 They should not be treated as incurable
 rithik roshan em power ke 'averides hiroj' abhiyaan ke launch par bol rahe the
 Hrithik said, 'I have seen many ups and downs
 maine depressant ko anubhav kiya he, maine sanshay ko anubhav kiya he, jaise ki ham sabhi karte hai
 This is very common
 ham jab bhi is par bolen, ise saadhaaran tareeke se hi len
 'hrithik said that accepting mental illness should also be fought in the same way as we do on other diseases
 rithik ke mutabik jo utaar-chadhaav unhone dekhe, unase ek vyakti ke taur par unke vikaas main madad mili
 Hrithik said, 'I faced many issues in my personal life
 aisa ham sabhi ke saath hota he
 If it is necessary to go up, then coming down is equally important
 ye donon hi aapaki shakhsiyat ko banane ke liye jaruri hai
 Clarity of your thoughts is important when you go down

 Hrithik made his Bollywood debut in 2000 with 'kaho Naa Pyaar Hai'
 rithik ne batayaki unhone apane kai doston ko ko dekha jo chupchaap depressant or anya maansik muddon se jujhate hai
 According to Hrithik, this inspired him to go deeper into the issue
 rithik ne kaha,ye wo cheez he jo barason se unke dimag main thi
 According to Hrithik, when we suffer from stomach or kidney problems, then we treat it as normal
 phir dimag kii koi samasya ho, jo bhi ek ang hi he, kyon itnaa dar jate hai
 It is understood that this is our fault and we should hide it from other people, everyone has to face mental issues at some point in life
 maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena ke bich sarkaar gathan ko lekar gatirodh jari he
 Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena has again targeted the BJP through its mouthpiece 'saamana' and has also accused the BJP of splitting the money to buy the mlas
 shivasena ne 'saamana' ke sampadakeey main likhaa he, ' rajya main mahayuti kii hi sarkaar aegi, aisi garjana bhaajapa ke chandrakant dada patil aadi netaaon ne kii he
 Sugar in his mouth because Sudhir Mungantiwar has claimed that he will get 'happy' news
 ab sawaal itnaa he ki wo sarkaar kab aegi or kisi hogi, ye dada aadi ne nahin bataaya
 The 'mahayuti' that the Bharatiya Janata Party is talking about is large in size, yet many parties involved do not have a single MLA
 ye bagaiyr vidhayakon kaa ‘mahamandal' parason rajyapal se mila or sarkaar gathan ke bare main chintaa vyakt kii
 These unnamed mlas will be seen joining the new government, forgetting all the previous things when the second government comes tomorrow
 ‘nivartmaan' kai mantri chintit hai
 They too worry about going to their official car, horse, bungalow
 unki dhadkan bad gai he
 But the people of the state are demanding in unison that the Shiv Sena should be the chief minister of Maharashtra, whatever happens
 jiske paas aankada hoga, wo sarkaar bhi banaae or mukhyamantri bhi banaae, ye hamaara bhi mat he
 It is written in the mouthpiece, now the same good news is expected from the point of view of Maharashtra and that is the leader of the 'shiv Sena' who is swearing in as Chief Minister
 maharashtra kii kismat main ek swabhimani sarkaar aegi or aisa yadi janata ke lalaat par likhaa hoga to us bhagyarekha ko mitaane kii takat kisi main nahin he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party is not sitting close to the door of discussion, it is being said
 hamane bhi daravaaje, khidkiyaan khol rakhi hai or hawaaen athkheliyaan kar rahi hai
 Just be careful that insect moths do not come in with the wind
 hamen chintaa he rajya kii va kisaanon kii
 The previous power is being used to distribute 'bags' for the next power, but no one is willing to put any money in the hands of the farmers, hence the farmers want the power of Shiv Sena
 yah ham sirf mudde kii baat kar rahe hai or mukke kii baat hogi to uskaa bhi uttar ham denge
 No state can tarnish Maharashtra's reputation

 The biggest challenge for the Australian team is Indian captain Virat Kohli, who is consistently performing brilliantly in all formats, be it Test or ODI
 viraat ko lekar australia ke kai purv cricketer pehle hi australia kii team ko chetavanee de chuke hai
 But it is not that Virat Kohli is the only one in front of the Kangaroos, Australia will have to deal with these challenges to defeat India: - The pair of Ashwin and Jadeja have always dominated the spinners on Indian pitches, foreign teams every time Indian spin Is seen kneeling in front of
 maujuuda test ranking main sheersh ke do gendbaaj ravichandran aswin or rabindra jadeja australia ke bada khatra honge

 pakistan main agle kuch ghanton main desh ke nae nizaam ke liye matdaan hone ja rahaa he
 Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan is leading the race for the Prime Minister, but it is interesting that this leader who aspires to become Prime Minister is contesting from not one or five places
 pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai)ke pramukh imran khan is baar desh ke 5 alag-alag sansadeey kshetra se chunaav lard rahe hai
 He is trying his luck in 3 seats from Punjab province of Pak
 iske alaava khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa or sindh praant se bhi ek-ek seat par chunaav lard rahe hai
 Imran has beaten the ground from Karachi (NA-243), Lahore (NA-131), Rawalpindi (NA-61), Bannu (NA-26) and Mianwali (NA-95)
 mana ja rahaa he ki unke 5 jagahon se chunaav ladane ke peeche desh ke har taraf se apane paksh main maahaul bananaa he jisase unke pradhanmantri banane kaa rasta saaf ho jaae
 It is not that Imran is contesting so many elections for the first time
 2013 ke aam chunaav main imran 4 siton parchunavalde the or is baar unhone ek seat badhaate hue karachi se bhi vah chunaav lard rahe hai
 However, the experience was not good for Imran in the 2013 election as he contested from Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Mianwali, defeating him in Lahore and winning 3
 lekin baad main unhone peshawar or miyanwali seat chhod di or upachunaav main unhen in donon hi siton par haar kaa saamana karnaa pad gaya
 Sharif's brother candidate from 4th place, Pakistan Muslim League (N) President and Nawaz Sharif's brother Shahbaz Sharif also does not appear confident of his victory in the election and is contesting from 4 places

 dilli main rojaanaa kareeb 13 hajaar trephic chaalaan kaate jate the, lekin mangalvaar ko sirf6 hajaar chalaankate gaye
 Delhi Traffic Police, which came under the influence of 'brick Case', is also going to implement some new rules

 dilli trephic police ab chaalaan ke dauraan apni shart par ek camera lagaakar rakhegi (neeche tasviir dekhen)
 This camera will be capable of recording up to 32 GB of audio-video
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki chaalaan karne vaali police team main ab chaar sadsy honge
 Although not a written order, it is an internal decision of the traffic police
 aisa hoga vah cameraudhar mahila kii aaropee pulicekarmi se bahes kaa audio saamne aane ke baad mangalvaar ko maamle main nayaa mode aa gaya
 In an audio recording, a woman Ramanjeet Kaur is heard calling the policeman Satish Chandra 'tucha' and refusing to show the paper of the car

 US President Donald Trump's statement on the issue of mediation on Kashmir may have been rejected by the Indian government, but this is not the first time that the US led by Trump has shown activeness on Kashmir
 yah zarur pehali baar hua, jab america raashtrapati ne bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa naam lekar kashmir par madhyasthata kii kathith peshkash kaa shigupha chhedaa ho
 India is furious at this, but the diplomacy is such that the Narendra Modi government is shying away from straightening the trump
 to kya yah donald trump ke sirphira hone or unki aparipakvata ke chalate hua he
 
 
 The There is no need to take it seriously, saying that it can be sidelined so easily
 
 
 ? ateet ke aaine main jhanken, to yah bakawaas se kahin zyaada he
 Since taking power in the US in 2017, Trump has had a keen eye on Kashmir
 tab sanyukt raashtra main america rajdoot niki heli ne do took kahkar sab ko chaunkaa diya tha ki america bharat or pakistan ke bich kuch ghatane kaa intazaar nahin karegaa
 In April 2017, Nikki Haley had largely clarified her intentions on Kashmir on behalf of the Trump administration
 niki heli ne bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav kam karne main apni bhoomika banane kii manshaa saaf kar di thi
 This was a major change in the US policy, under which America has always considered Kashmir as a bilateral dispute between India and Pakistan
 trump apni simit kootnithik kshamta kii numaaish samay-samay par karte rahe hai, lekin kashmir par ab madhyasthata kii peshkash vaala bayaan sirf ek gaiyr-zimmedaarana bayaan nahin he
 US President Donald Trump is already interested in resolving mutual disputes between India and Pakistan
 isi saal farvari main jammu evam kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatankwaadi hamale ke baad trump prashasan ne tanaav ko kam karne kaa shrey liya tha
 The US also claimed to be pressurized for the safe release of India's pilot Abhinandan Vardhaman from Pakistan's occupation
 iske alaava, sanyukt raashtra main pakistan main baithe aatank ke sargana masood azhar ko vaishvik aatankwaadi ghoshit karne main china par dabaav daalane main america prayaason ko nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa
 After a long struggle, China stepped back to put a hindrance in declaring Masood Azhar as a global terrorist
 aisa mumkin he ki trump korian upmahadweep main shanti sthapit karne main apane karname se prabhavit hokar 70 saal se zyaada puraane kashmir vivaad ko hal karne main haath aazmaana chaahate hon
 Putting North Korea and South Korea on the table for a long time and using nuclear weapons to maintain peace in the shadow of North Korea's gibberish is an achievement, and in this case Trump trumped all former US presidents Huh
 uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong un ke saath america rishton main aayaa badlaav or ek nahin, do-do baar raashtrapati trump or kim jong un ke bich hui mulaakaat bataati he ki vivaad sulajhane ke maamle main trump ne kachi goliyaan nahin khelin
 However, it is a different matter that Trump's diplomacy is also responsible for the cancellation of the agreement with Iran or the cooling of US relations with other European countries including Britain
 jahaan tak bhartiya pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kashmir par madhyasthata kii peshkash kaa trump kaa daawa he, use trump kii taraf se die gaye un hazaron bayanon ke sandarbh main dekhne kii zarurat he, jo bebuniyaad paae gaye hai
 Donald Trump will also be known in American history as the president whose tenure has made the most baseless and childish statements
 america akhbaar 'da washington post' ke mutabik 10 june, 2019 tak apane 869 din ke kaarykaal main raashtrapati donald trump 10,796 jhuthe yaa bhraamak bayaan de chuke hai
 Because of this, Trump's statements have become a burden for the American administration, whose advocacy and support does not make it hard for most Americans to swallow or swallow
 kashmir kaa mudda bharat or pakistan ke aapasi sambandhon kii lakshmana rekha he, jis par madhyasthata kii peshkash karnaa lakshmana rekha langhane jaisaa he
 But the mood of the trump is not accustomed to follow the lines of Lakshman, so in such a situation, India will have to be ready in future to face such a googly while in power

 On the proposal of the Congress party to elect the President with a general opinion, Sushma Swaraj of BJP said that the party is in this right
 swaraj ne saaf kaha ki party yah bhi nahin chaahegi ki congress party se kisi bhi prakaar kaa koi samjhauta nahin hoga
 This means that there is no secret agreement between the two major parties for the post of President and Vice President
 swaraj ne kaha ki samaajawaadee party ke aghoshit ummidavaar purv raashtrapati dow apije abdul kalam ko sharton ke saath samarthan dene ko taiyaar he
 The BJP says that if the SP advances Dr
 Kalam's name then he will support him

 Radas, who were counted among the great saints of India, used to say- 'mana heng to kathauti ki Ganga'
 yani man saaf he to punya kamaane ke liye ganga snaan ke liye ganga nadi tak jane kii koi jarurat nahin
 But when it comes to the temple, the outlook also becomes political
 kyonki siyasat kii duniya main ye kahawat badal kar- mandir vahiin banaaenge- kaa rup le leti he
 The political aspect of what has happened since the demolition of the Ravidas temple in the last 12 days in the country's capital also needs to be seen and understood
 dakshin dilli main sant ravidaas kaa ek mandir giraae jane ke baad khilaaf daliton main aakrosh he
 Politics has also started on this issue
 dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ne guuruuvaar (22 agast) ko faisla kiya ki jahaan mandir todaa gaya, vahaan bhavy mandir banaaya jayega
 The Delhi Assembly has also passed a resolution for this
 jahaan is mudde ko lekar aam aadmi party or bijepi saamne he
 While the Kejriwal government blamed the BJP for this, only Aam Aadmi Party MLA Ajay Dutt tore his clothes from Ambedkar Nagar
 to vahiin bijepi aadmi party par aarope laga rahi he
 Now Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari has also jumped on this issue
 saath hi manoj tiwari ne bada bayaan diya
 He said, 'the temple will be built where Ravi Das Ji's temple was
 bijepi ko chaahe court janaa pade yaa phir sarkaar ko isko lekar koi faisla lenaa ho, sant ravidaas ji kaa mandir vahiin banavaayenge
 Further Manoj Tiwari said, 'where the temple was there will be built
 bijepi kisi bhi haalat main iskaa rasta niklegi or mandir vahiin banegaa
 This matter was in the court, when the verdict came, it was not in our cognizance, no those who went to the court told us, otherwise it could have happened that the temple might have broken under BJP rule
 'jab ham log ko jaise hi isaki jaankaree mili, ham log turant mantri hardip puri se mili the
 Manoj Tiwari did not stop, he attacked the Delhi Kejriwal government and said, 'it is not known in Delhi who is running the government
 jab itani badi ghatana hone ja rahi thi to dilli sarkaar ke esadm, patawaari or lekhpal kya kar rahe the?'dilli main agle hi saal vidhansabha kaa chunaav he
 While BJP is away from power in Delhi for 22 years, on the issue of Dalit population, 12 out of 70 seats in Delhi are safe where only Dalit society decides who will win and according to 2011 census, Dalit and Jatav population in Delhi Nearly 28 lakhs have been drawn, due to which the tussle between Aam Aadmi Party and BJP has been drawn, even today, the team also met the Dalit community and Jatav society in the areas of Govindpuri
 daliton main ravi das mandir ko tode jane ko lekar jabardast gussa dikhaa
 As soon as we talked about the demolition of the Ravi Das temple in Govindpuri, a large number of Dalit people gathered and raised slogans against the central government
 govindpuri ke ravi das mandir ke pradhan doctor naresh kalpi ne kaha, 'jo bhi hua bahut galat hua
 This temple was quite old, when this temple was built, at that time there was not even DDA, this land was handed over by Sikandar Lodhi but now DDA is claiming his authority
 dalit samaaj is mudde ko chhodane vaala nahin he
 'then the former head of Ravi Das temple, Banarasi Das said,' Central government is responsible for this
 kai parkon main logon ne mandir or sarkari jameenon par masjid bani hui he lekin unako giraane kii koi baat nahin karata he lekin hamaare poojya sant ravi das ji mandir ko todaa gaya, hamaara ye virodh jari rahegaa
 'so Dr
 Shiv Ram from the Dalit community said,' As the temple has been demolished, the temple should be built there, it is a matter of our faith
 kaaphi sankhya main dalit samaaj ke purush ho yaa phir mahilaon main isko lekar jabardast gussa tha
 After which Aaj Tak's team also visited him in Tughlakabad where Ravi Das ji's temple was
 jahaan dilli ke alag-alag ilaakon se dalit samaaj ke log baahar hi puja karne pahunch rahe the
 The place where this temple used to be is called Ravi Das Marg
 mandir jane ke raste ko diwaar se dhak diya he or police kaa jabardast paharaa he
 When people were asked about the temple, they said, 'this temple was very big and not small, it was a very old temple
 mandir ke paas hi ek talab tha jahaan log snaan karte the
 There is also a belief that people used to take the soil near the pond with them
 logon kaa maananaa tha ki jisko bhi charm rog he wo vyakti agar talab ke paas mitti ko sharir par lagane se charm rog khatm ho jaataa he
 On the order of the Supreme Court, the DDA protested against the demolition of the Ravidas temple and staged a demonstration and vandalism in Delhi
 buudhvaar raat hote-hote maamla itnaa gambhir ho gaya ki jahaan mandir todaa gaya tha vahaan pradarshnkaree tughluqabad ke us ilaake main ghusane kii koshish karne lage
 He also tried to break the wall around him
 logon ne police par patharav kiya or danda barasaaye
 In this case, Govindpuri police station took into custody about 80 people including Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar, who was said to be arrested late on Wednesday night

 main mumbai par yah aalekh-yah shahar kya he or kya ho saktaa he-boston ke ek upnagar ke thande or hare-bhare maahaul main likh rahaa hum
 i have been here for a month, a month has passed since i left the city where i was born, i will probably never return (at least not as a resident), and i have to learn new skills immediately, There is another addition to them: how to write based on your memories like a seasoned NRI writer
 mumbai main dashakon bitaane ke baavjood khaas-khaas baton kii yaaden abhi se dhundhlee hone lagi hai: monsoon kii sard hawa kaa bhina-bhina ehsaas, pados kii masjid ke laudspikar kii jhankaarne vaali aawaaj, bheed ke samay trephic jam main funsane kii yatnaa
 During the last few years, when i reached the early thirties of my age, my father died and i became a father myself, my romance with Mumbai began to end; His facts began to be difficult to ignore, and then i realized that i did not care about the fate of that city
 yah bhraamak sthiti thi
 i have written about Mumbai for many years
 lekin mumbai se meraa algaav romance ke khatme se badhkar tha; yah janm-janmaantar ke sambandh tuutane jaisaa tha
 One does not quickly separate from his mother; When this kind of situation comes, there is a lot of emptiness in life and it may take a lot of time to fill it
 mujhe lagata he ki paanch saal pehle mumbai ne us samay mehmaannawaaji kaa ehsaas khatm kar diya, jab meri patni kavita or maine shaadi ke baad pehali baar swatantra rup se rahane ke liye ghar talashne kaa faisla kiya
 Like first-time home seekers, we wanted a better home and hoped to achieve it, and our budget was as low as our aspirations were
 lekin us shahar ne fouran hamaari ummiido par pani pher diya
 Mumbai's real estate market is the single most frustrated and heartbreaking aspect of the life of this metropolis
 isse koi fark nahin padataa ki aap apane bajet ko kitna badhanaa chaahate hai or uske badale aap kitna kam sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai, mumbai ke bhu-mafia aapke pairon tale jameen khiskaa denge
 This is not a complaint about the city's well-known residential discrimination; The boundaries of places where Muslims can buy property or not, and if i sometimes strayed beyond that border, my ignorance could only be blamed for it
 hamane un kshetron-kolaba, majgaanv, bhaikhla or fort-main hi apni talash jari rakhi jo dharmanirpekshata ke garh maane jate the, ve aisi jagahen hai jahaan boar khaane vaale, murti poojak tathaa bakre kaatane vaale ek-duusare ke prati udasin rahakar apane kaam se kaam ke andaaj main ek saath rahete hai
 We knew it as the quality of Mumbai
 dharmanirpekshata ke in gadhon ke saath samasya yah thi ki ve mumbai ke sabase puraane ilaakon main shaamil hai, jahaan kii imaaraten utani hi puraani hai
 Our search for 1 BHK brought us two options: one house was on the third floor in a 100-year-old building, and the other on the second floor in an 80-year-old building
 donon imaaraton main lift nahin thi, na daravaaje the, na hi parking kii jagah thi or unke maalik aise asahaay log the jo apni karodon ru
 Despite the property, the city's rent control laws were already very persecuted
 ek imaarat manas lakdi kii shateeron par khadi thi
 They were buildings that do not stand even till we are middle-aged, forget that Kavita and i would spend our old age
 hamane ghar kii talash upnagaron main shuru kar di, uske saath hi auto-rickshaw kii sawari shuru hui or aksar agent ke saath apointment kaa vakt nikal jaataa tha
 We have often made up our mind on various large flats of buildings with a pleasant atmosphere, but only then did we see the basic infrastructure of life in the suburbs of Mumbai - irregular water supply, expensive electricity rates and completely isolated during the monsoon
 Danger of going
 maine kai varshon tak apane doston or rishtedaaron ko mumbai ke vibhinn ilaakon main flats kharidte dekha he
 i used to think why are they willing to accept so little by paying so much money
 mumbai or manahaton kii tulana dikhaawati or haasyaaspad he
 Your money is recovered in New York
 mumbai main aap bas paisa chukaate rahete hai
 And then you get stuck somewhere and are scared there
 kavita or main 2007 ke dauraan samudr ke kinare ek flats main peing guest kii tarah rahete the
 By then i had given up my search for a house and had learned how to live happily after paying the rent
 hamaari imaarat or arab sagar ke bich machuaaron kii ek badi basti thi
 We used to think that this settlement offers a rustic view in front of our luxurious home
 apane kamare main pravesh karne ke kuch saptaah baad ham subah 5 baje laudspikar par bhajan kii aawaaj se jag gaye
 This voice was coming from the same colony
 baad main subah hamaari makaan malkin ne bataaya ki yah maheene main ek baar hota he
 He mentioned something which meant that the fishermen were praying to please the gods of the sea
 holi ke dauraan hamen ek saptaah tak dinabhar or der raat tak sangeet bajane kii aawaaj bardaasht kerani padi
 And then Ganesh Chaturthi came, it seemed that loudspeakers would never stop
 hamaari imaarat main ek flats kii keemat kai karod ru
 was
 us complex main siio, celibrity or udyogpati rahete the
 The queue of expensive cars in the covered parking area looked very attractive indeed
 iske baavjood, itane nami-giraami nivaasiyon main se kisi ko bhi nahin lagata tha ki unke paas machuaaron ko sirdard karne se rokane kaa adhikaar tha
 During Navratri, when i could not read or work because of the sound of music coming from the fishermen's colony, i threatened to call the police
 meri makaan malkin ne kaha ki main aisa kar saktaa hum basharte main apane cellphone se kol karun or apana pataa na bataaun
 i decided to do so and called the police
 mere paas ganvaane ke liye kuch nahin tha (police ne meraa pataa nahin poocha or sangeet band kara diya gaya
 But would they have acted so quickly on the complaint against the sound coming from the loudspeaker of the neighboring mosque?)
 uske baad se main us shahar kii sansaarik safalataa ke dikhaave se prabhavit nahin hota tha
 It became clear that every person sitting within each top-floor penthouse and within Mercedes's tinted glass is badly intimidated by the encroachment of mischievous elements on his own private area and his personal property
 un shararti tatwon ko mumbai main khuli chhot mili hui haih kai tarah kii senaayen, muslim prabhutv vaala anderworld, or mumbai police, jo sabase badi mafia he
 i did not want to succeed in a city like this, where you get nothing in return for your hard work and have to keep your lips stitched for life
 boston ke upnagar main vah sab kuch he, jo mumbai main mere ilaake bhaikhla main nahin tha
 My family and i are living with joy and ash in the peace and silence of Norwood
 lekin shantipurna maahaul hameshaa nahin rahata
 i am waiting for another problem now, and a neighbor of mine may adopt a rude party or rude way of watching TV in an insensitive manner
 main apni shikaayat darj karaane ke liye 911 par kol karuunga, or phir jab is desh kaa kanoon apana kaam karegaa tab mujhe pataa chalegaa ki mumbai chhodane kii jahamat uthaanaa sahi tha yaa nahin

 china kii badaniyati ek baar phir ujagar hui he or is baar satellite tasveeron kaa saboot bhi he
 India claims that China is polluting and diverting the waters of the Shiang River in Arunachal Pradesh
 satellite tasveeron se bharat ke daavon ko bal miltaa he ki kis tarah china shiyang nadi ke pani ko diawart or pradooshit kar rahaa he
 This was confirmed by satellite imagery expert Colonel Vinayak Bhat (retired) in an exclusive conversation with India Today
 unhone kaha, 'china ne brahmaputra kaa pani puri tarah roak diya he
 Within 60 km of its territory, China has built a dam 200 meters wide and 900 meters long
 yah baandh nadi ke samanaantar he
 Bhat further says that the entire water is being sent out through the tunnel below the mountains at a certain point in the north direction
 ye tunnel 50 meter chaudaa he or nadi kaa puraa pani iske jariye diawart kiya ja rahaa he
 He said, 'this means that China is doing something with the entire water of Brahmaputra and it is going to have an impact on the farmers and agricultural system of India in the coming days
 agar china pani ko diawart kar rahaa he, joki ek cese he, to jaahir he ki bharat ke hisse ke pani par iskaa asar padane vaala he
 Its quantity may be reduced
 'bhat ne aage kaha, 'jo aaj ho rahaa he uskaa matlab ye he ki is project par chini polimur regin aidahisive (gond yaa chipkaane vaala padaarth) kaa upyog kar rahe hai, jiskaa istemaal dhul ko khatm karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 All this is flowing with water and whatever they are doing in the tunnel, they are flowing it in the river water
 'unhone kaha ki iske chalate ilaake main logon kaa jivan or aajeevika prabhavit ho sakati he
 Animals and birds can also die due to polluted water
 lekin ab yah pani maanvon ke pine laayak bhi nahin rahaa
 Bhat said, 'it has not happened in a day
 china ise chhupaae rahaa he or ab iskaa asar dikh rahaa he
 It would have taken at least a year to make it
 kyonki pehle kii tasveeron main yah nahin dikh rahaa tha
 China has stopped all the water of the Brahmaputra
 tibet main is nadi ko yaralung sango kaha jaataa he or yah bahudeshiy nadi he
 It is illegal to stop its water completely
 'duusari ore doklam main china kii ore se sainikon kii sankhya badaye jane kii pushti bhi satellite tasveeron ke jariye hui he
 Bhat said that things have changed in his area after 16 June 2017
 china ne apni sena badhaai he
 Bhat said that China has deployed almost the entire division in Doklam
 saath main do maikenised unit bhi hai
 Such a large number of troops have been deployed right below Doklam
 keval 5 se 10 kilometre kii duuri par 5 hajaar chini sainikon or 300 od wheekals kii maujuudagi ko dekha ja saktaa he
 He said that the pictures of December 3 and 10 are very clear
 china vahaan apana jaal bicha rahaa he, jiske bare main hamen jaankaree nahin he
 India now needs to take action immediately
 bhat ne kaha ki bharat ko international forum janaa chahie or jitna sambhav ho logon ko jaankaree den
 Also, try to put pressure on China in other ways
 unhone kaha ki hamaare paas bahut sari chijen hai jahaan keval 300 yaa 400 meter ke liye ve ham par dabaav bana rahe hai, ham china par dabaav bana sakate hai or diplomatic tareeke apana sakate hai
 He said that the Government of India is saying that this is their area and we cannot do much
 lekin ye aisi cheez he jise lekar sahaj nahin hua ja saktaa
 This is a very serious matter
 jab sardiyaan biit jaaengi, tab ham ek aisi sthiti main honge, jise handle karnaa aasaan nahin hoga

 The PM was to inaugurate it on 11 March but sources say that he is still considering whether to join the program or not

 "he (afridi) listens to the senior players and takes the senior players and coaches in confidence," Misbah said on Sunday ahead of the much-awaited semi-final match against arch-rivals India on Wednesday
 ham achche samanvay se prayek faisla kar rahe hai isliye sab kuch acha chal rahaa he

 Misbah said that the team is united and all the senior players including former captain Younis Khan are helping the junior players
 unhone kaha, team ke sadsy acchhee tarah se ghulemile hai
 The most important thing is that the team is playing as a unit
 prayek khilaadi sahi samay par behatar pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Each is playing the role the team wants from him
 misabah se jab yuvaraj singh or jahir khan jaise khilaadiyon se nibatane kii ranneeti ke bare main poocha gaya, unhone kaha, aap keval ek yaa do khilaadiyon ke liye ranneeti taiyaar nahin kar sakate
 All 11 players are important and we have to make strategies for all
 ham kisi ko halke se nahin le sakate
 They are all world class players

 The Shiv Sena has questioned Anna Hazare's fast at Ramlila Maidan in an editorial in the mouthpiece Saamana
 saamana ke sampadakeey main poocha gaya he ki anna hajaare dilli kyon gaye or dilli jaakar unhone kya hasil kiya
 Let us know that Anna Hazare sat on an indefinite hunger strike last week at the Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne madhyastata kii or anna kii maangon par kaam karne kaa likhit aashwaasan diya
 After this, Anna broke her fast in seven days
 saamana main likhaa gaya he ki ye to acchhee baat he ki anna sahi salaamat apane gaanv waapas laut aae, lekin is anshan se kya hasil hua, is par log sawaal puch rahe hai
 Anna's weight decreased by 6-7 kg, but nothing came from this movement
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki vaise pichley andolan se bhi kya hasil hua, iskaa khulaasa koi karegaa kya? desh main lokapal or vibhinn rajyon main lokayukta kii niyukti kii jaae
 This demand was there yesterday, is still today and will remain after 6 months
 'anna kii haalat laalkrishna adwani jaisi'lekh main kaha gaya he, 'anna ke pichley andolan main jo log anna jindabad ke naare laga rahe the or lokapal chahie hi aisa kah rahe the wo sabhi log dilli or duusare rajyo main sattashin hai
 Anna's condition has become like LK Advani's at this time
 antar sirf itnaa he ki adwani maun hai or anna bol rahe hai
 Anna is confused that the government will listen by speaking and being hungry
 'lekh main kataaksh karte hue kaha gaya he ki fadanvis kii madhyastata se hi anshan tootna tha
 Anna had to believe in him only, instead of Ramlila Maidan, Anna would have agitated in his village Ralegan Siddhi
 pradhanmantri narendra modi yaa grih mantri rajnath singh ramlila maidan jaaenge, aisa to hone vaala nahin tha
 But it seemed that some cabinet minister would go to the Center
 ant main likhaa gaya he ki anna ne agali taarikh dekahanshnatod diya

 ) a bench of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Friday quashed the previous order of the court to strictly enforce the legal ban on cow slaughter and beef sale
 court kii is peeth ne kaha ki is vishay par rajya sarkaar or vidhansabha ko vichaar karnaa he
 a bench of Justices Muzaffar Hussain Attar, Justice Ali Muhammad Magre and Justice Toshi Rabstan restored the status quo in a way
 yahaan bataa den ki supreme court ne 5 oktober ko peeth se gomance par pabandi ke mudde ke samaadhaan ke liye kaha tha

 raipur main yojit uniphid cmand kii baithak main rajya ke sabhi naksal prabhavit ilaakon main naksaliyon kii dharpakad or unhen kaabo main laane ke liye anti naksal oparation chalaaya jayega
 Helpers will be considered Anti-national Government has also made it clear that cases against Naxalites' helpers will now be registered under anti-national activities instead of normal cases
 yahi nahin bastar main sadakon kaa nirmaan kaary bhi bataur oparation chalaaya jayega
 Instructions to destroy all the places of the Naxalites In the meeting of the Unified Command, instructions have been given to destroy all the places of the Naxalites by conducting a first intensive operation in the border areas of Chhattisgarh state
 raipur main yojit uniphid cmand kii baithak main naksaliyon ke khilaaf sidhi kaarywahi ko lekar police or kendriya surakshabalon ko hari jhandi de di gai he
 a special strategy to destroy all the Naxalite targets before the rains was discussed in this meeting
 is baithak main chhattisgarh police ke alaava CRPF,BSF,ITBP,CISF or RPF ke aalaa afasaron ne hissaa liya
 The special thing is that now the construction of roads and laying of rail tracks in Naxal affected areas will be carried out as an operation
 abhi tak police or kendriya surakshabalon ke jawan sirf sadak nirmaan ke kaary main jute the, lekin ab in ilaakon ke vikaas ke liye railway kaa vistaar bhi hoga
 Its accountability has also fallen on the shoulders of central security forces
 baithak main naksaliyon ko sabak sikhaane ke liye kade faisle liye gaye hai
 Not only this, criminal cases will be registered against the helpers of Naxalites under the National Security Act and anti-national activities

 hindi kii sarvaadhik charchit lekhikaon main shumaar chitra mudgal kaa pichley 10 disambar ko janmdin tha
 Just a few days ago he received his novel 'post Box no
 203 naala sopaara' ke liye sahitya academy puraskaar milane kii ghoshnaa hui he
 Obviously the excitement is double
 unke prashansak, prakaashak, parivaar, mitra or sahitya-premiyon ke saath bhi unhen bhi kam khushi nahin
 The phone rang that has not been closed since the day of award
 phir aaj to bhor se hi yah kram jari he
 She considers this love of the people as her greatest attainment and award
 dilli chhod abhi vah wardha main hai, or unke jimme mahatma gandhi antarrashtriya vishvavidhyalay kaa ek bada kaam he
 In this crowd of congratulations, 'sahitya Aaj Tak' spoke to him a long time, but this tide of emotions could not be formalized
 vah aaj 75 saal kii ho gai hai
 But even at this age, her thinking is not about herself, but about her own people, it is about the society, about the section for which she wrote, to which she remained attached
 sansaarik taur par, saamaajik taur par, paariwarik taur par
 In this list, everyone from the big circles of literature to the common activist, farmer, laborer, associate writer, senior junior, husband Awadhanarayan Mudgal, children, son-daughter-in-law, from the era of movement to Medha Patkar, today, with warmth and determination remembered
 par saamaajik or shabdon kii duniya kii is anuthi hasti chitra mudgal ko unke lekhan kii charchaa ke bina badhai kisi
 So once again we write his novel 'post Box no
 203 naala sopaara'kii charchaa ke bahaane hi phir se badhai de rahe, jiske liye unhen sahitya academy puraskaar mila
 Novel 'post Box no
 203 naala sopaara' kaa kathanak kinnaron kii adbhut sangharshgatha ko samete hue he
 The novel is in the form of serial letters written to his mother by Vinod alias Binny alias Bimli, handed over to the circle of eunuchs during schooling, in which he describes his life situations and household memories
 haalanki uski maa bhi apane kinnar putr javaabi patr likhti he, par ye patr prishthbhumi main rahete hai
 The letters written by the son itself reveal what the mother wrote in her letter! Jubilee Special: December
 
 
 
 And Nalasopara is almost the last station on the western route of Raghuveer Sahay's Yadmumbai to be considered the lifeline
 yahaan adhiktar rihaaish unki he, jo mumbai ke duusare mashhoor upnagaron main ghar nahin le pate
 Vinod gave his mother living in the same suburb the post box no
 203 ke pate par chitthiyaan likhata he
 Why does Vinod alias Binny have to write letters to communicate between his life and dear mother by living in the same city? These distances have been created by the society between them, who are unwilling to accept his mother, whom he calls Ba, and Binny
 ling doshi ke rup main paidaa hue apane manjhale bete vinod se bahut lagaav hote hue bhi saamaajik dabaav, ghar ke bheetar bade bete-bahu kii maansik pareshaani or sabase bad kar kinnaron kii mandali ke aatank ke dar se maa chaudaa varsh kii avasthaa main vinod ko kinnaron ko saunpane ko majaboor hoti he
 Vinod is similar to his other classmates studying in school in every respect
 antar sirf itnaa he ki vah skool kii charadivari se sat kar pant ke batan khol kar nivrutt nahin ho saktaa
 As far as education is concerned, he always used to come first in his class
 baavjood iske vinod ko aise narak main dhakel diya gaya, jahaan uski pahchaan tak hi daavan par nahin he, balki vajood hi halak main aa jaat he
 There is no feminine tendency in Vinod, so he is not able to adapt to them despite the coercion and persecution of the group of eunuchs and wants to live by labor
 upanyaas main nayak ek jagah apni maa ko likhata he, 'sabane mujhase munh mode liya
 But the dreams did not hit me aaj bhi ve mere paas berok-tok chale aate hai
 'he has a dream, a dignified life like a normal human being
 vah baar-baar prashn uthaata he ki jananaang viklaangata ko itnaa bada dosha kyon maan liya gaya he? sirf isi kaaran use ghar-parivaar, rishte-naate sabase cat kar narak kii jindagi kyon bhogani pad rahi he?punyatithi vishesh: bhulaae nahin ja sakate 'kaal-katha' or kamtanathupanyaas ek bada prashn uthaata he ki ling-poojak samaaj lingavihinon ko kaise bardaasht karegaa? upanyaas is prashn par gambhirtha se sochane ko vivash karata he ki aakhir ek manushya ko sirf isliye samaaj bahishkrut kyon hona pade ki vah ling doshi he? sirf isi kaaran uski ummiido, sapanom, aakankshaon, bhaawanaaon kaa galaa kyon ghont diya jaataa he? upanyaas is baat ko prabalata se rekhaankit karata he ki hamaara samaaj jab tak yon kendrit bana rahegaa, tab tak yah samasya bani rahegi
 Freedom from a sex-centered society is the dream of this novel and its central narrative
 upanyaas main nayak kahata he, 'jananaang viklaangata bahut bada dosha he, lekin itnaa bada bhi nahin ki tum maan lo ki tum dhad kaa maatr vahi nichalaa hissaa ho
 No brain, no heart, no heart, no eyes
 tumhaare haath-pair nahin hai
 Are, are, are, all are the same as others are
 yon-sukh lene-dene se vanchit ho tum, vatsalya sukh se nahin
 You cannot have children, but you cannot become a father, who did not let you understand this? ”vinod alias Binny also raises the question that why the classification of eunuchs in terms of gender? They should have the freedom to choose their gender, not to be cast into others
 anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati, pichhadaa varg, viklang aadi sabhi samaaj ke vanchit varg hai, par ve baqayda stri-purush bhi hai
 Similarly, sex workers should be kept in the classification along with these deprived
 patr-style chintan-pravaah yaa vichaar-pravaah ko abhivyakt karne ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt maani jaati he, par lekhika ne iske madhyam se katha-pravaah ko abhivyakt karke ek anoothaa prayog kiya he or isamen ve puri tarah safal bhi hui hai
 The novel also brings out the fact that how the interest of mainstream politics in the country is different from the real problem
 siyasatbaajon kaa lakshya kinnaron ko maanviya garima dilaane main nahin, balki aarakshan kaa laalach dekar unhen vot bank ke rup main sirf upyog karne kii he
 At first, the ruling party gives him a boost by seeing the possibility in humor, but he is killed as soon as he starts to instill self-respect in the eunuchs instead of begging for reservation
 upanyaas kaa ant maa dwaara apni mrityu se thik pehle apane kinnar bete ko saarvjaanik rup se sweekaar kar apni sampatti ko teenon beton main baraabar-baraabar baantne kii ghoshnaa sambandhi vigyaapan se hoti he
 This novel obviously demands a lot of research and compassion
 yah upanyaas unhone kyon likhaa ke sawaal par chitra mudgal ne ek baar kaha tha, 'pehle main bhi kinnar ko saamaanya nazariye se hi dekhati thi
 For example, like others, when this train came to ask for money in the bus, it refused
 unke prati kisi tarah kii samvedansheeltaa nahin thi
 But in 1979, a eunuch was found in the train at New Delhi railway station
 baatcheet main usne jab apni kahani bataai to ankhen nam ho gayi or meraa najariya bhi badal gaya
 His story was in the mind
 usne bataaya tha ki aathvin paas karne ke baad hi use champabai evam phir tulsibai ke haath saunp diya gaya, jo use sari pahanane ke liye vivash karti thim
 At first i could not muster the courage to write it, but i was shocked when they were placed in the Zero Others column in the 2011 census
 aarakshan sahit anya mudde saamne aane par upanyaas likhane kaa nirnay liya
 'now that this novel of Chitra Mudgal has not only become very popular, but has also received the award, then she wants more for this society
 upanyaas ke puraskrit hone ke turant baad die ek saakshaatkaar main unhone kaha tha, 'main chaahati hum ki is upanyaas ko pathyakram main shaamil kiya jaae, taaki nai peedi ko kinnaron ko sammaan dene kii prerana mili
 'in his own words,' you look at history, Sabal has always been persecuting the weak
 is julm kaa shikaar mahila or dalit don hue, par bhedbhaav ke chalate mahilaon, daliton ko kabhi ghar se nahin nikaala gaya, jabaki kinnaron ke maa-baap hi unhen ghar se niklaa dete hai
 Why society put them in this condition is also a question
 meri koshish usee sawaal ko uthaane kii thi
 'chitra Mudgal has always been successful in raising society and issues related to her life and writings
 vah dderghaayu or swasthy hon, taaki unki sakriyata se yah samaaj behatar bane or hindi sahitya gunjyman hota rahe
 Election results of Uttarakhand state have also been revealed
 piem modi ke karishme kii vajah se bijepi ne 70 siton main se 57 siten jeet lee hai
 In such a situation, it has been seen that the Chief Minister candidate has been imposed from above
 bijepi bhi is maamle main juda nahin he
 Meanwhile, the names of two contenders, Satpal Maharaj and Trivandra Rawat, are coming forward strongly from the BJP
 sutron ke hawaale se aane vaali khabaron par vishwaas karen to sangh ke kareebi trivendra ravat ko mukhyamantri banaaya ja saktaa he
 He is close to the BJP president as well as in charge of Jharkhand
 trivendra ravat doiwala seat se jite hai
 He has defeated senior Congress leader Heera Singh Bisht
 unakichhavi bedaagmani jaati he
 That is why it is believed that BJP can give them a chance, so that a strong government can be formed in the state
 satpal maharaj bhi kursi kii daud main haisatpal maharaj gadhwal se congress ke loksabhaa saansad bhi rahe hai
 In the fifteenth Lok Sabha, Satpal Maharaj was successful in reaching the Lok Sabha on a Congress ticket
 lekin ab satpal maharaj congress chhodkar bijepi main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections 2014, Satpal Maharaj joined BJP
 haalanki satpal maharaj loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt ummidavaar to nahin bane lekin unhoneypane sabhi samarthakonke saath bijepi ke paksh main maahaul banane kii puri koshish kii thi
 Which had benefited BJP in elections
 is baar satpal maharaj chaubatkhaal kshetra se chunaav maidan main hai

 Akhtar said, "we are victims of the incident, but the Gurgaon Police has registered an FIR on two people of our family, which is an attempt to put pressure on us
" ’is maamle main police upayukta himanshu garg ne kaha ki hamane abtak 13 logon ko giraftaar kiya he or anya kii talash kii ja rahi he

 aabaadi ke lihaaj se uttar pradesh desh kaa sabase bada suba he or loksabhaa main yahaan se sabase zyada 80 siten hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -led NDA has broken the trap of caste politics by defeating the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 raajnneetik jaankaar bhi sahamat hai ki upi main jati aadhaarit matdaan kii pravriti ko kaaphi had tak todane main bijepi ko kamyaabi mili he, lekin india today data intelegence unit (DIU) ne apane adhyayan main jo paaya wo in daavon se ulat hi tasviir pesh karata he
 The study was conducted by the DIU on the basis of poll data from Uttar Pradesh compiled by Ashoka University's Trivedi Center for Political Data (TCPD)
 iske mutabik uttar pradesh main dalit kshetron ko jeetne ke liye bijepi ne apane dalit netaaon main se aadhe se zyada ko duusari partiyon (khaas taur par bispi) se laakar apane saath joda
 The 15 seats reserved for SC went to the BJP account, out of 80 parliamentary constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, 17 are reserved for Scheduled Castes
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main mivati ke netritv vaali bispi ko in 17 main se do hi siton- nagina or lalganj main kamyaabi mil saki
 At the same time, 15 seats reserved for SC in bjp's account
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne uttar pradesh kii sari 17 surakshit siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 This means that the BJP lost two reserved seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ne 15 surakshit siton par jeet to hasil kii, lekin ye party ke liye bada utaar chadhaav vaala tha
 Some Dalit leaders left the BJP just before the election
 
 
 
 So did the BJP say that Dalit leaders should join with them? Of the 17 reserved seats contested by the bjp-led NDA, 9 were defectors
 wo shuru se hi bijepi ke saath nahin the, balki duusari partiyon se naata todakar bijepi main aae the
 Out of these 9 seats, 3 seats were such that the leaders of BJP who left the BSP just before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections contested and won

 iske baad shailendra kumaar ne raghuraaj pratap singh urf raja bhaiya kii party jansatta dal (loktantric) kaa daaman tham liya or isi ke tikat par 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ladaa

 mayawati kii party ko espi ke yadav vot to mili lekin bispi ke dalit vot espi ummidavaaron ke haq main transfar nahin hue
 The same results came from the actual results of 17 reserved seats
