 The missing student of 12th student Priya Roy has exposed the crores of crores of rupees in the private and public schools of Bihar
 patna kaa mashhoor diavi skool sabase badi fajihat jhel rahaa he kyonki yahaan bacchon ko fail karaane or phir paas karaane ke naam par lakhon kii rakam anthne kaa aarope laga he
 The case came up after Priya Roy's disappearance from school
 jab priya ko fail karne ke baad skool ne usase 12veen kii pariksha dilwane ke liye ek lakh rupee maange
 Priya went to school for 1 year fee of Rs 63 thousand, then the school management refused to give her the admit card for the examination and Priya disappeared from the school itself
 kareeb 20 din baad jab priya stesan par bhatakati mili to ye raaj saamne aayaa
 Actually Priya was failed in the 11th and was also expelled from school
 lekin puure saal skool kii santh-ganth se wo class karti rahi
 The school had secretly assured that it would be given the Class 12 examination, but when it came time for the 12th examination, an amount of more than Rs 1 lakh was demanded from it
 jab maamle kaa khulaasa hua to pataa chalaa skool ke teen shikshak or principal bacchon ko pehle fail karaate hai or phir lakhon kii rakam anthne ke baad unhen 12veen kii pariksha dilaate hai
 The police have arrested 80 such cases in which the school has committed this mischief by causing disturbances to the children
 ek taraf police is baat kii tahakikat main juty he ki in 20 dinon main priya kahaan thi kyonki parivaar ne priya ke apharan kii ashanka jataai thi
 On the other hand, the school management in the case is badly clouded
 haalanki teen shikshakon ko jail bheja ja chukaa he jabaki principal giraftaar se bachane ke liye faraar he
 It is clear that there was a fraud in the school, but now there is a demand to widen the scope of the investigation, because the business of getting the children to pass by the failure is not only in one school but in many schools of Patna This business has been going on before
 vaise to is duniya main saare insaan ek na ek din chale jane ke liye hi janm lete hai lekin kuch aisi bhi shakhsiyaten hoti hai jo apane krititv va karmon kii vajah se jite ji kinvadanti ban jaati hai
 Mahashweta Devi was also the name of one such person

 She was unwell for a long time and suffered a heart attack on 23 July
 amuman aisa hota he ki lekhak yaa kalakaar khud ko raajnneetik pachade se dur hi rakhte hai
 He avoids political rhetoric despite having political understanding, but Mahasweta Devi was an exception in this matter
 jab pashchim bengal menvampanthi partiyonki sarkaar thi or lambey samay tak satta kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke baavjood unhen laga ki ve acha kaam nahin kar rahe to vah vipaksh ke manch par ja chadhin
 Trying to make them realize this by putting an eye in the eye of the power, the public is paramount in Kilokantra
 sarkarein to aani-jaani hai
 The greatest criterion and success of a writer is that his works are translated into different languages of the world
 mahasweta devi kii kritiyaan 'hajaar churaasi kii maa', 'agnigarbha' or 'jangal ke daavedaar' ko kalt kritiyon ke taur par janaa or padhaa jaataa he
 His work has also been made on the mother of Thousand Chaurasi

 bihar ke bahubali netaa shahabuddin kii jail se rihaai ke saath hi bihar main ek bade kheme main jashn he
 Shahabuddin, who was convicted in the murder case from the High Court, has been released on bail
 magar 11 saal baad jail se baahar nikalne ke baad bhi shahabuddin ke tevar barkaraar hai
 Know the ten special things about the release of Shahabuddin - Mafia don and Bahubali leader Shahbuddin was released from Bhagalpur jail at around 8 am on Saturday
 purv saansad kii agavaani karne ke liye unke hajaaron samarthak jail ke baahar jute the
 When Shahabuddin came out of jail as soon as he came out of jail, he directly attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unhone kaha ki ve nitish ko apana netaa kabhi nahin maanate
 Their leader is only Lalu Prasad Yadav
 - 11 saal kii jail ke baad khuli hawa main saans lene vaale bahubali shahabuddin ke daaman par bhale hi jurm ke kai daag hai
 But when he got out of jail, he was wearing a white kurta pajama
 - jail ke baahar aate hi bahubali ko samarthakon ne gher liya
 Thousands of supporters were eager to get a glimpse of Shahabuddin
 kai samarthak phool maalaaen lekar aae the
 Those he wore to Shahabuddin and those who could not, threw garlands on his car
 - mohammad shahbuddin sankado gadiyon ke kafile ke saath bhagalpur jail se apane grih kshetra siwan ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Many mlas of the Grand Alliance also joined his convoy
 iske alaava shahbuddin ke saath kafile main kai rajd netaaon ke shaamil hone kii bhi ummid he
 Even before the release of Shahabuddin, Girdhari Yadav, MLA from Belhar assembly seat of Banka, wrote on his Facebook wall that Shahabuddin will be released from Bhagalpur Central Jail at 8 am on Saturday
 unke kafile main 1300 gaadiyaan shaamil hongi
 And that is exactly what happened on Saturday morning
 - udhar puure sivaan main samarthakon ne jashn kii taiyaari kii gai
 The journey of 376 km from Bhagalpur to Siwan was completed in about 6 hours
 raste main jagah-jagah unka swaagat kiya gaya
 - Due to the long convoy of the former MP, many places got jammed
 raste main jahaan jahaan bhi unka kafil rukaa har taraf raste jam ho gaya
 His supporters also lit fireworks in many places
 - shahbuddin ke sataae logon ke gharon main matam pasra he
 Many people are afraid that the slaughter of three sons of a house may not even make them their prey
 - bataate chalem ki 2005 main satta main aate hi nitish ne shahabuddin par nakel kasi thi
 He remained in jail for the entire 11 years, but getting bail in the former RJD MP, who is in jail in 39 cases, is considered a coincidence
 haalanki log ise satta se jodakar bhi dekh rahe hai
 a dreadful case of road rage has been reported in Delhi
 uttar-purvi dilli ke silampur ilaake main said na dene par hue vivaad main ek shaks kii aankh phod di gai
 After the incident, the police conducted a medical test of the victim at GTB Hospital
 aankh phodne kaa aarope un do yuvakon par he, jo bike par savaar the
 Both the accused are absconding
 police maamle kii padtaal kar rahi he
 There was a film 'bajrangi Bhaijaan', but in Chhattisgarh, Bapu is face to face with the BJP and Congress about 'bajrangi'
 bilaspur shahar main swatantraaa diwas samaaroh ke dauraan us samay vivaad kii sthiti ban gai, jab sthaneey prashasan ne mahatma gandhi kii pratimaa par bhagava rang putava diya
 Seeing Bapu painted saffron, the Congressmen got angry
 pratimaa ko golden brown rang main rangabilaspur se lekar raipur tak pradarshan kii taiyaari ho gai
 The administration swung into action after seeing the matter engulfed
 phir baapu kii pratimaa par golden brown rang chadhaaya gaya
 The color was completely confirmed, then the Congressmen laid flowers on the statue of Mahatma Gandhi
 haalanki maamle ke niptaare ke baad tamaam logon ne ek-duusare ko swatantraaa diwas kii badhai di
 First Mahatma Gandhi's statue was carved with black stones, then saffron and after that Bapu started appearing in golden brown color
 ye maamla bilaspur shahar ke gandhi chowk kaa he
 In view of Independence Day, the local administration gave instructions to clean and paint the statues of freedom fighters and great men established in the city
 iske baad afasaron kii dekharekh main shashan ke nirdeshon ko amalijama pahanaaya jane laga
 Congress alleged that saffronisation was upset with the state Congress president Bhupesh Baghel alleging that the BJP is engaged in saffronisation of every institution in the state
 or ab usne mahapurushon kii pratimaaon tak ko nahin choda he
 However, Gandhiji's statue was painted in golden brown color after our protest
 congress kii aapatti ke baad tatkaal color badalane ke faisle par jab nigam karmiyon ko bulaayaa gaya to phir prashasan musiibat main ghir gaya
 By then, the corporation workers had returned to their homes after doing their work
 afasaron ko wo dhunde nahin mil rahe the
 Seeing the trouble standing on the head, the officers again searched the painter of the city
 unhen pakadakar pratimaa sthal par laayaa gaya
 After this, the practice started to paint Bapu afresh
 jab tak ki baapu kaa rang puraa golden brown nahin ho gaya, congressi yahaan date rahe
 BJP gave this logic to BJP spokesperson Srichand Sundarani terming it as frustration of Congressmen
 unke mutabik congress ke paas koi mudda nahin bachaa he, isliye wo vyarth kii baton ko tool dekar bijepi par aarope lagaati he
 He argues that saffron color is a symbol of respect
 unki party ise dhaaran kar gaurav mahasoos karti he
 Sundrani says that if a worker has made a color under a mistake, it can also be changed
 lekin congress swatantraaa diwas jaise din bhi ise rajnatik mudda banaakar logon ke saamne le janaa chaahati he

 The bitter memories of the war crime have its roots in the resentment of protesters in the tragic birth of Bangladesh on December 16, 1971, when the Pakistan Army finally laid down its weapons after seeing the defeat

 kashmir ghati main algaavvaadiyon kii apil par hone vaali baar-baar kii hadataalon ke bich hijbul mujahidin pramukh saiyad salahuddin ne kaha he ki aise pradarshan sahi vikalp nahin hai kyonki inase aam aadmi prabhavit hota he
 Salahuddin said, "this movement is not for two-four days, it will take a lot of time
" 
 Therefore, continuous strike is not the right option
 andolan chalanaa chahie, lekin shaikshanik santhaan or arthvyavastha sambandhi sansthaanon ko bhi lagaataar kaam karte rahane chahie
 "salahuddin told a local dialogue committee" "there should be a strategy for this so that people too are not affected and the movement should continue
" hadtaal alag-alag charnon main ho sakati he, taaki aam aadmi pareshaan na ho or bacchon kii padhai bhi chalati rahe
 "the Hizbul chief also advocated to run this demonstration at the district level
 salahuddin united jihad council kaa bhi pramukh he jisamen 13 aatankwaadi sanghathanon kaa pratinidhitiv he
 According to Salahuddin, "march can be appealed to districts other than Sopore, Anantnag, Baramulla and Kupwara, apart from which people of other districts continue to do their work normally
" isse na to arthvyavastha prabhavit hogi or na hi bacchon kii shiksha
 Opposing the dialogue between the Center and the separatists, the head of the terrorist organization said "hurriyat leadership should stay away from any kind of dialogue with India for a short time
" iske bajaae unhen ek sanyukt ranneeti banani chahie
 Salahuddin said that the United Jihad Council has stopped its armed activities at all the places where people are demonstrating
 seemaa paar se ghuspaith ke sarkaar ke daavon kaa virodh karte hue aatankwaadi sanghathan ke mukhiya salahuddin ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne seemaa par suraksha balon ke 3
 5 lakh soldiers have been deployed and how is it possible to infiltrate
 usne kaha ‘‘agar iske baad bhi sarkaar aise daawey kar rahi he, to ve log seemaa par kya kar rahe hai
 ' puraane indore ke chintaman ganesh mandir main in dinon pital kii ghantiyaan kam or mobile kii ghantiyaan zyada baj rahi hai
 Chintaman Ganesh in high-tech manner also listens to the requests of devotees on mobile phones
 das divasiy ganeshotsav ke dauraan unka number milanaa khaasaa mushkil he, kyonki duniya bhar main faile bhakt unhen phone karke muraadein maang rahe hai
 This ancient Devasthan of the Juni Indore area of the city presents the idea of how 'innovative' mobile telephony can be used for religious purposes in a country of unique colors of faith
 vah din bhi dur nahin jab 3ji video telephoni ke jariye log vighnaharta se mulaakaat bhi kar sakenge
 Temple priest Ashok Pathak told that his devotees have been writing letters to Lombodar for 35 years
 magar hytech yug main pichley paanch saal se bhakton ne unhen sidhe phone karke muraadein maangani shuru kar di he
 The reader explains that the unique tradition of calling Viraje Chintaman Ganesh in the nearly twelve-hundred-year-old Parmarikala temple began when a devotee hailing from Indore settled in Germany
 vah hajaaron mile ke faasale se bhagwaan ko niyamit taur par chitthiyaan likhaa karata tha
 Once he called the temple priest
 usne kaha ki ab vah phone ke jariye ganesh tak apana sandesh pahunchaana chahta he
 Keeping the feelings of the devotee, his wish was fulfilled
 iske baad se yah silsilaa chal padaa
 a sensational case has come out of Delhi involving 4 rogues who were searching for miscreants looting 25 to 30 lakhs of rupees and Rs 1 lakh cash
 jahaan ilaake memhai alertke baad bhi hathiyaaron se lash badmaashon ne jewelri shop main ghuskar lutpaat kii
 All the crooks escaped after committing the entire incident
 police lut ke puure maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The CCTV present at the time of the incident is being investigated
 lut kaa sisitivi aayaa samnessisitivi main police ne paaya ki jewelri shop main badmaashon ke giroh kaa ek badmaash pehle khaali haath dukaan ke andar daakhil hota he
 First he does full Reiki within the shop and then 3 crooks enter inside one by one
 iske baad sabhi hathiyaaron ke dam par dukandaar ko bandhak banaakar lut kii vaardaat ko anjaam dete hai
 Police investigating DCP Rohini said, 'saturday afternoon is the incident
 ye puri lut kii vaardaat shri ram jewalers ke yahaan hui thi
 In this entire incident, four crooks were looted
 badmaashon ne kareeb 25 se 30 lakh kaa saamaan or 1 lakh rupee cash lut kar le gaye
 Surprisingly, this incident happened when Delhi was on high alert and the police were constantly patrolling the streets, currently raiding in search of miscreants
 police ke mutabik sabhi badmaash car main savaar ho kar aaye the, dukandaar kaa naam gulshan he
 The Finance Ministry on Wednesday said that professionals helping people applying for visas do not fall under the service tax net and there is no proposal to levy service tax on such people
 kendriya utpaada evam seemaa shulk board (sibiisi) ne ek sakarular jari kar kaha, vija kii suvidha uplabdh karaane vaale log sidhe vyaktiyon ko sahaayta uplabdh karaate hai or ve duutavaason kii ore se agent ke taur par kaam nahin karte
 Therefore, they do not come under the service tax

 com / xqfn60928r After the terrorist attack on the Uri Army Base, patriotism has its zeal on all sides
 desh ke sapooton ke balidaan ke aage har koi natmastak he
 But why it happens that for some time after the sacrifice of the martyrs, they are remembered very loudly
 phir dhire-dhire sab bhula diya jaataa he
 This question is about the old parents of a martyr
 chaar saal se adhik arsa hua, ye donon intjaar kar rahe hai ki koi netaa aakar unke laal kii pratimaa se pardaa hataayega
 His old eyes were stoned, but no one realized his feelings
 shahid ke liye netaaon ke paas vakt nahinjaipurase mahaj 50 kilometre kii duuri par sthit gaanv kaa naam he shekhavati kii dhani
 Here, a cloth-covered statue of Shaheed Prakash is waiting when a leader gets time from the government and he comes to the village to unveil the statue
 haalat ye he ki pratimaa ke chaaron ore bandhaa kapadaa bhi taar-taar hone ko aa gaya he
 But our leaders who talk big about patriotism are unable to find time for this
 pita ne banwaaya shahid bete kaa smarkashhid prakaash ke pita krishna meena kii aakhon main 13 may 2012 kii taarikh yaad kar aaj bhi aansu aa jate hai
 On this day, his lad Prakash was martyred while taking iron from the Naxalites in Dantewada
 us vakt prakaash kii umr sirf 23 saal thi
 Father Krishna had decorated his heart with great respect for Prakash's wedding
 lekin phir unhone apane jivan bhar kii kamai 11 lakh rupye se bete kaa smarak banane kaa faisla kiya
 The memorial is ready
 iske baad krishna prashasan ke har adhikari se lekar mukhyamantri ke daftar tak pratimaa ke anaavaran ke liye guhaar laga chuke hai, lekin har jagah jaldi vakt dene kaa bas aashwaasan hi mila
 The assurance was received, but no time Krishna had met the then Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, then he also gave time for the unveiling of the statue
 lekin phir chunaav kaa elaan hone ke baad aachaar samhita kaa hawala dete hue kaarykram ko taal diya gaya
 Vasundhara Raje became the Chief Minister of Rajasthan after the elections
 vasundhara se milane ke krishna patni bhagwati ke saath pahunche
 He got an assurance from Vasundhara too, but did not get time
 krishna kaa kahana he ki wo ilaake ke saansad or kendriya mantri rajyavardhan singh rathod se bhi chaar baar mil chuke hai, lekin unase bhi pratimaa ke anaavaran ke liye vakt nahin mila
 According to Krishna, he has also written a letter to the Prime Minister's office
 abhi vahaan se bhi jawaab kaa intjaar he
 Mother-father Krishna and Bhagwati are tired of waiting - they are so tired of waiting that now their patience is also being answered
 shahid prakaash kii maa bhagwati kaa kahana he ki diwaali tak koi netaa nahin aayaa, to wo khud hi apane laal kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran kar dengi
 Bhagwati says that her son's soul dwells in this statue
 bhagwati kaa sharir boodha ho chukaa he, lekin wo har din khud apane haathon se smarak kii saaf-safai karti hai
 Two more soldiers of Dausa were also martyred in Dantewada, along with the unveiling of Prakash by CM
 un donon javaanon kii pratimaaon kaa mukhyamantri ke haathon anaavaran ho chukaa he
 This was the reason that Krishna and Bhagwati also wanted the curtain of their son's statue to be removed by the Chief Minister
 lekin prakaash ke saath jo do or jawan shahid hue the, unke gaanv haive se sate hue hi the
 At the same time, the way to go to Prakash's village is very bad
 tuuti sadak par kai kilometre kaa patharilaa rasta tay kar is gaanv tak pahunchnaa padataa he
 Is this the reason that leaders shy away from reaching there
 agar aisa he to phir kis munh se kaha jaataa he:shaheedon kii chita par lagenge har baras meley,vatan par marane waalon kaa yahi baaki nishaan hoga
 
 
 Pranab Mukherjee is presenting the last budget of the 5-year tenure of the UPA government in the Lok Sabha
 mandi se ubaarane ke upaay, aam aadmi or korporate india ke vishay main sarkaar kii kya ranneeti he iskaa aaj khulaasa ho jayega
 Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has completed preparations for presenting the Interim Budget for the year 2009-10
 2009 -10 ke is antarim bajet ke bare main anumaan to lagaaya hi ja saktaa he
 Since this budget is the last budget of the UPA government, there is complete scope that this budget should be an election budget
 tex main thodi raahat kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he, yaa nahin to tex kaa maujuuda dhaancha barkaraar rakhaa ja saktaa he, antarim bajet main mandi se nipatane ke upaay jarur honge, or isliye houseing, nirmaan auki niryaat kshetra ke log raahat kii ummid kar sakate hai, chunaav bas chand kadam dur he isliye aam aadmi ke liye raahaton kii bauchhaar jarur hogi, isliye kisaan, chote auki majhule str ke udhyami, naukari pesha log, mahilaayein, yuva varg badi ummiden kar sakate hai
 Although it is meaningless to expect an interim budget like a general budget, but it is also certain that the UPA government will leave no stone unturned to make its last budget of the current term as much as the public budget

 In UP, there is an alliance of miscreants
 aparaadhiyon ko lekar upi police ection main he
 This is the reason why reports of police encounters from UP have become common
 upi ke alag-alag shaharon main police ne encounter kar bade aparaadhiyon ko dher kiya he
 Transport city of Noida's Sector 69 resonated with the bullets of police and miscreants when the police tried to stop the accused going into two suspicious circumstances during the checking, but the miscreants started fleeing by dodging the police
 iske baad police ne peechha kiya to badmaashon ne firing shuru kar di
 In retaliation, the police also had to fire in which both the crooks were injured
 police ke mutabik 29 janvari ko ye badmaash ek shaks ko OLX ke jariye phone bechney ke bahaane mili or usko jabaran apni gaadi main khinchne lage, jab kuch haath nahin laga to usapar goli chalaakar faraar ho gaye
 But now the crooks got into the hands of the police
 police ne badmaashon ke paas se ek car, do tamanchey, baari maatra main kaartoos,ek laptop, ek mobile or kuch numberplexramad kii he
 a reward of 10-10 thousand was kept on both the crooks
 mujffarnagar main bhi badmaash dhermujaffarnagar main bhi pachchis hajaar kaa inami badmaash police ke hathe chadha
 Indrapal, who has been terrorizing the area for many years, was trying to carry out a major crime in the forest area with his fellow miscreants
 jahaan police ne soochna milte hi ilaake ko puri tarah se gher liya or donon taraf se jamkar firing hui
 Indrapal was killed in this firing, while the rest of his companions managed to escape
 indrapal 30 se zyada kai badi aparaadhik ghatnaon ko anjaam de chukaa tha or kaaphi lambey samay se police ko badmaash indrapal kii talash thi
 At the same time, he was also involved in the murder of a policeman
 mujffarnagar main kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar ek or muthbhed hui
 In this encounter between the police and the miscreants, a reward of 10,000 rupees named Manoj was injured after being shot, who has been sent to the district hospital for treatment
 ghayal badmaash ke paas se ek chori kii bike or pistal baraamad hui he
 Even in Saharanpur, a reward of 25 thousand was received by the miscreants
 police ne checking ke dauraan qasbe kii ore aati ek motorcycle savaar do logon ko jaise hi police ne rokna chaha to bina ruke teji se bhaagane lage
 On which Gangoh police chased the miscreants along with giving information on wireless
 soochna ke baad krime branch team or thana nakud police kii team ne fundpuri ke paas badmaashon ko gher liya
 Seeing themselves surrounded, the miscreants started firing
 police kii taraf se javaabi firing main ek badmaash ko goli lagi or wo ghayal ho gaya
 It is clear that the UP Police is in a full-fledged action mood with big criminals on target
 jo ek ek kar police ke hathe chadh rahe hai
 This trend comes back every few years, but the policy makers do not seem to learn any lesson
 yah sarkarein bana or bigaad saktaa he
 Yet they ignore it and eventually pay the price
 sitambar ke duusare saptaah se pyaaj ke khudara daam rashtriya rajdhani dilli main takreeban 100 fisadi chadh gaye, jabaki uttar bharat ke duusare shaharon main to isamen kareeb 300 fisadi kii oochaal aa gai
 It was hit on the budget of the houses
 sarkaar ne iskaa jawaab apane bafer stock kaa pyaaj bazaar main utarkar diya, taaki yah aasaani se mil sake
 It raised the minimum export price (MEP) to US $ 850 per tonne FOB (free on board) price to stop exports
 itnaa hi nahin, 29 sitambar ko centre sarkaar ne pyaaj niryaat par pabandi laga di or ise jamaa karne kii seemaa tay kar di
 Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has said that the situation will be normal in the coming few days
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan kehete hai, ''barish or baadh se parivahan main dikkat aa rahi he
 The central government is releasing buffer stock of onions
 jo bhi rajya chaahe, nafed se pyaaj le saktaa he
 "in some cities of North India, the price of a kilo of onions reached Rs
 80
 sarkaar ke aankade dilli main pyaaj kii keemat 57 rupye prati kilo bataa rahe hai
 In Bhopal, onion was sold at Rs 20 per kg in the retail market three weeks ago
 madhya saptaah tak isaki keemat chalaang lagaakar 50-60 rupye prati kilo par pahunch gai
 In most parts of onion growers, heavy rains are being considered as the main reason for the rise in prices
 godaamon main rakhe pyaaj ko bhi musaladhar barish se nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Due to floods and waterlogging, onion arrived late in the market and prices started skyrocketing
 bharat main saal main do baar pyaaj kii paidaavaar hoti he
 Sowing is done mainly in the months of October – November after the departure of the monsoon and harvesting begins in February, which continues till the end of April
 yah fasal chakra rabi kii fasal ke saath aata he or desh ke zyaadaatar hisson kii pyaaj kii maang, takreeban 70 fisadi tak, puri karata he
 Traders store a portion of the onions grown in this cycle, which they market in the monsoon when prices generally rise
 pyaaj ugane kaa isse chota chakra bhi hota he
 Early onion varieties are grown in many parts of central India and Maharashtra
 is chakra main ropai kharif sijan ke saath-saath kii jaati he or ukhaadie kaa kaam sitambar main shuru hota he jo aktubar tak chalata rahata he
 Meanwhile, onion has suffered heavy rains in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan and West Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke mandsaur jile main pyaaj ugane vaale bade ilaake gandhi sagar baandh ke dub kshetra main aa gaye
 This caused damage
 mukhyamantri kamalnath, purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan jaisai kai netaa ilaake kaa daura kar chuke hai or raahat main sarkari amala juta hua he
 The farmers of Maharashtra's major onion growing districts Nashik and Ahmednagar have only 20 percent onion left
 jab tak nayaa pyaaj taiyaar nahin hota tab tak isi pyaaj se kaam chalaanaa hoga jo ki paryaapt nahin hoga
 Due to excess rainfall, onion production is expected to decrease this year
 badhate daam ko dekhakar centre sarkaar ke krishi vibhaag ke adhikari aanan fanan 20 sitambar ko lasalgamv pahunche
 Those officers went to know about the onions available in the market and how the prices suddenly increased

 Bachchan believes that if the farmers get some money due to shortage of onions, then the government should not interfere
 ''pichley varsh puraa sijan barabaad ho gaya tha
 We did not get even one rupee
 is varsh kuch paise mil rahe hai to sarkaar ko isse dur rahanaa chahie
 "farmers have predicted the price of onion to be normal till Diwali
" bharat duniya main china ke baad pyaaj kaa doosraa sabase bada utpaadak desh he
 About 20 percent of the world's onions are grown in India
 apiidie yaa apida ke mutabik, desh main takreeban 10 lakh hectare kshetra main pyaaj ugaaya jaataa he
 1 in most years
 5 karod metric ton utpaadan hota he
 Like many other crops in India, onion cultivation is in large area but productivity is low
 indian horticulture ke aankadon ke mutabik, bharat main paanch sabase zyada pyaaj ugane vaale rajya hai maharashtra, karnataka, gujarat, bihar or madhya pradesh
 The government has resorted to market intervention measures, due to which prices may come to a standstill in some time
 magar lambey vakt ke liye sarkaar ko mahangi technology main nivesh karne kii jarurat he taaki godaamon main rakhe pyaaj ko kudarat ke kahar se bachaaya ja sake
 Unfortunately, most governments have not shown interest in investing in expensive technology, despite the fact that onion has changed election results many times
 1998 main vidhansabha chunaav main dilli or madhya pradesh main congress satta main laut saki, to iske peeche pyaaj ke daamon main oochaal ko hi mukhya vajah bataaya jaataa he
 Samar Vijay Singh, a progressive farmer from Indore, says, "we have given a model of onion storage to the Madhya Pradesh government, but it did not approve
" '' vijay singh ne 2013-14 main centre sarkaar ke vigyaan or technology mahakme ko prastaav diya tha
 He had accepted that and asked the state government to give it some financial assistance
 vijay singh kehete hai, ''is project main pyaaj ke ginotip yaa jin ke prakaaron kaa puraa adhyayan karke un kismon kii pahchaan kerani thi jinhen zyada lambey vakt tak jamaa karke rakhaa ja saktaa he

 bharat or srilanka ke bich shanivaar ko hone vaale vishwacap cricket ke final mukaable ke liye soochna or prasaaran mantralay ke hastkshep ke baad isisi ne electranik media ke kawarej par pabandi ko hataa diya he lekin media dishanirdeshon kaa ulanghan karne waalon ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii baat kahi he
 The ICC said in a statement released on Friday evening that the ICC has decided to take legal action against Indian channels who repeatedly violate the guidelines for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, instead of banning the Cricket World Cup final
 isamen shaamil companiyon ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai karne kaa faisla kiya he or bharat main adaalaton ke madhyam se nuksaan kii bharpai kii maang kii jaaegi
 Earlier in the morning, before the match in Mumbai, the captains of the two countries and representatives of channels covering the press conferences of ICC President Sharad Pawar were prevented from coverage
 aisi hi pabandi buudhvaar ko bharat-pakistan ke bich hue semifinal match se pehle electranik media par lagaai gai thi
 But this ban was lifted at the initiative of Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni
 isisi ke vaktavy ke anusaar nayi dilli main soochna or prasaaran mantralay main der tak chali baithak main neshnal brodcasters association :enbie: or brodcast editors association :biie: ne is baat kaa aashwaasan dene se inkaar kar diya tha ki ve apane kaaryakramon main prasaaran dishanirdeshon ke ulanghan se bachenge
 ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said, "I am deeply disappointed that this has happened
" haalanki hamen apane tathaa saajhedaaron ke vishesh vyavsaayik adhikaron ko bachaane kii jarurat he
 If we have to take legal action, it will be regrettable but necessary
 isisi ne kaha ki samvaadadaataaon or cameraman ko is shart par praveshpatr jari kiye gayi the ki ve dishanirdeshon kaa paalan karenge
 Sources in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said that Minister Ambika Soni spoke to the ICC President and Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar on the issue and told them that the issue is not so big that it cannot be resolved
 samajha jaataa he ki isisi ne ambika soni se kaha he ki doordarshan ko footage praapt karne kaa adhikaar he isliye bharat kii janata tak match ke prasaaran main koi samasya nahin aegi
 Annie Joseph, Secretary General of the News Broadcasters Association, said, "he (ICC): asked us to agree that the footage would not have commercial use, which is wrong
" unhone kaha ki channel tii-20 or ekadivasiy maichon ke liye banaaye gayi dishanirdeshon kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 Annie said, "if the ICC had a problem, they should have told in advance and not done it before the semi-finals
" ek anya sanghathan brodcast editors association :biie: ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki isisi kaa faisla na keval uske hiton ke balki nagarikon ke soochna ke adhikaar ke bhi virodhabhasi he
 Regardless of the result of the Test match series between India and South Africa, the number one position in the ICC rankings of the Indian team will have no effect
 lekin agar dakshin africa team teenon match jeet leti he, to vah sheersh do main shaamil ho jaaegi
 The International Cricket Council (ICC) said in a statement that the Indian team currently has 124 points, while South Africa are 13 points behind it
 agar phalf duplasis kii aguwai vaali team 5 janvari se capatoun main shuru hone vaali 3 test maichon kii siries main clin sweep karti he, to phir donon tiimon ke samaan 118 ank ho jaaenge
 Team India's 'gabbar' is fit before the first Test, but Jadeja will remain at number one in a similar situation as he will be ahead of South Africa on decimal calculation
 dashamalav main gananaa par bharat ke 118
 47 points, while South Africa's 117
 53 ank honge
 Conversely, if India manages to win all three Tests, then Virat Kohli's team will get 128 points, while South Africa will be 107 points
 is bich australia ne england ke khilaaf guuruuvaar se sidney main shuru hone vaale tisare test match se pehle siries main 3-0 kii badhat lekar apana teesraa sthaan pakkaa kar liya he
 England, however, have to win the final Test to avoid being ranked 5th
 
 
 
 So will Dhoni be excluded from the BCCI top grade contract? If Australia wins the series 4–0, then it will be 104 points and move up to third place
 aisi sthiti main england ke 99 ank ho jaaenge or vah 5wein sthaan par khisak jayega
 a 3–1 result in the series would mean that Australia would finish third with 102 points and England fourth with 101 points
 ballebaajon kii ranking main duusare sthaan par kabiz bhartiya captain viraat kohli apane kariyar main pehali baar 900 reating ankon tak pahunch sakate hai
 Kohli, who is in fine form, currently has 893 points and with his good performance, he will be included in the list of certain batsmen scoring 900 rating points
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki quran main bahuvivaah kii ijaajat isliye di gai he taaki un mahilaon or bacchon kii sthiti sudhari ja sake, jo us samay lagaataar hone vaale yuddh ke baad batch gaye the or unka koi sahaara nahin tha

 supreme court ne manahani ke ek maamle main dilli siem arvind kejariwal samet unki party ke teen netaaon ko notice jari kiya he
 On the petition of the son of Union Minister Kapil Sibal in the old defamation case, the Supreme Court issued notices to Kajriwal as well as Prashant Bhushan, Shazia Ilmi and Manish Sisodia
 saath hi supreme court ne is maamle main dilli hoicourt ke aadesh par roak laga di he
 This means that on the next date of trial on March 5, these four accused may have to appear in court
 kapil sibbal ke bete amit sibbal ne dilli hoicourt ke us aadesh ke khilaaf supreme court main yachika daakhil kii thi, jisamen usne trial court ko kejariwal kii yachika sweekaar karne ko kaha tha
 All the accused, including Kejriwal, had demanded the High Court dismiss the defamation case filed against them
 16 janvari ko hoicourt ne yachika par sunwaayee karne se inkaar karte hue yachikakartaon ko ise trial court main pesh karne ko kaha
 The High Court also said that in this case if a person applies for exemption from personal appearance, the court can allow it
 amit sibbal ne hoicourt ke isi aadesh ko supreme court main chunauti di he
 Amit Sibal is also a lawyer
 unhone pichley saal july main hi yah maamla daayar kiya tha, jis par sunwaayee chal rahi he
 After all, what is the whole matter 
 
 amit sibbal kaa aarope he ki in netaaon ne vodaphone tex maafee maamle main unhen or unke pita ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii thi
 These AAP leaders accused Kapil Sibal of misusing his position by revising tax demand in the case of telecom major Vodafone
 kejariwal ne press conference karke sibbal ke khilaaf aarope lagaae the
 Kejriwal accused Law Minister Kapil Sibal that he settled Vodafone's liability of Rs 11,217 crore to Hutchison Essar outside the court within 24 hours of becoming Law Minister
 AAP netaaon ke mutabik kapil sibbal ne aisa tab kiya tha, jab unke bete amit hachisan main kaam kar rahe the
 Kejriwal had raised the question whether Sibal was given Rs 2000 crore for this work? Significantly, in 2007, Vodafone bought Hutchison Essar for which he had to pay Rs 11,217 crore to Hutchison
 amit sibbal us samay hachisan ke vakil the
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's petition in the Arun Jaitley defamation case
 kejariwal ne is yachika main ucchtam court se arun jetali dwaara daayar aapraadhik manahani ke maamle main nichali adaalat kii sunwaayee par roak lagane kii maang kii thi
 Earlier, Delhi High Court has rejected this demand of CM Kejriwal
 kejarivalane apni yachika main kaha tha ki jetali ne unke khilaaf patiala house court main aapraadhik manahani or hai court main civil manahani ke mukademe ek saath daayar kiye he
 Both the cases cannot be heard simultaneously
 jis par supreme court ne kaha ki aisa koi niyam nahi he ki civil mukademe ke chalate aapraadhik mukademe kii sunwaayee nahin ho sakati
 Jethmalani, appearing on behalf of Kejriwal during the cross-examination, said that the Kisupreme Court should protect the rights of the CM of a state
 ye ek shakitshali vitt mantri or ek chote se rajya ke garib mukhyamantri ke bich kaa maamla he
 The Supreme Court said that we are only considering facts and evidence here
 bahes usee daayre main honi chahie
 Jethmalani, appearing for Kejriwal, said that there is a fight between the collegium and the government over the appointment of judges
 is par justise pisi ghosh ne unhen tokate hue kaha ki abhi ham collegium par vichaar nahin kar rahe hai
 During the hearing, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Jaitley, did not have to say a word
 gauratlab ho ki arvind kejariwal nirun jetaliper didisie main ghotaale main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 BJP MP Kirti Azad also joined Kejriwal
 party ne kirti par karrwai kii thi or jetali ne arvind kejariwal par manahani kaa mukadmaa thok diya tha
 Kejriwal had said in the petition filed in the High Court that criminal proceedings should be stayed due to two cases running simultaneously

 wo us ladki ko bataa rahi he ki 12 se 15 hajaar rupee ke evaj main wo baba kaa khaas saannnidhya paa sakati he
 The most important and most shocking part in this entire chat is the one in which Sadhvi asks the girl to come alone to the party
 ladki baba kii sadhvi se apane pati ko saath laane yaa naa laane kaa sawaal puuchhati he, jis par sadhvi kaa jawaab he ki is party main sirf ladakiyon ko hi aane kii ijazat he

 gramin gruhiniyon ke ek samooh ke saath baithi or unki boli samajhane kii koshish kar raheen 24 varshiya prerana kumaar swatchta ke saath-saath is baat par charchaa kar rahi hai ki ve kuch atirikt paise kis tarah kama sakati hai
 Just a year ago, she was happy with her job at a research firm in Noida
 unhen yahi lagata tha ki ve jo chaahati thim, use hasil kar chuki hai
 After graduating in bio-technology in 2010, the Gurgaon girl had no more academic ambitions
 lekin prerana marketing or human risource management kii ahmiyat ko samajhati thim
 Prerna, a promising student from the start, passed the Xavier Aptitude Test (XAT) 2012 and enrolled in the Post Graduate Program in Human Resource Management at Xavier School of Management (XLRI), one of the best business schools in the country
 is course ko puraa karne main unhen abhi kuch maheene or lagenge lekin exelarai unhen apni yogyata nikhaarane ke kai vyaavhaarik maukey pehle hi uplabdh karvaa chukaa he
 After doing an internship at Novartis, Switzerland, Prerna and her XLRI classmates are visiting the village of Swahaspur, about 50 km from XLRI, to work with a large group of illiterate rural women
 unka mishan? unhen sainitory pad ke istemaal kaa mahatv samajhnaa or usase paise kamanaa sikhaanaa
 how? As the XLRI students explain, "after persuading these women to use pads, by selling pads to women from nearby villages
" ’’exelarai kii siiai yang indiens socity kii sachiv prerana or unki team gramin mahilaon ke liye sthaayee aajeevika model banane kii disha main kaam kar rahi he
 Two months ago, when the students of the institute first raised a few thousand rupees to distribute sanitary napkins to the women of Swahaspur, they found that the women were unwilling to "talk about this strange subject with strangers"
 lekin mahilaon ko muft napkin lene ke liye raji karne main sirf teen seshan lage
 Now a corporate house has promised to set up a production unit manufacturing biodiggable napkins in Swahaspur under its CSR program
 prerana mahilaon ko bataati hai, ‘‘mashin se rojaanaa 1,500 napkin kaa utpaadan hoga
 After taking out just five days in a month for production, you will need to spend the remaining 25 days in marketing
 yaad rakhie, bechney main safal hone ke baad hi aap paise kama sakengi
 Women agree with a smile
 abhi shuruyaat he lekin prerana or unki team, jamshedpur ke enjio seeds (soshiyo iconomic and ajukeshan deveopment socity) ke saath exelarai ke god liye gaye gaanv swahaspur kii mahilaon main positive antraprenyorship ke beej bone kaa kaam kar rahi he
 XLRI Director E
 abraham es
 J
 kehete hai, ‘‘exelarai main hamaara adarsh vaakya he-main and vimen for adars (insaan dusron kii seva ke liye hi bana he)
 We do not limit our goal to maximum profit
 ’’ ve bataate hai ki institute ke har chaatr ko samaaj kii bhalaai ke liye kaam karne vaali ek mulya pranali ko apnaane ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 XLRI is also perhaps the only major business school in the country where managerial ethics is a core subject in all courses and where every student has to undergo a village exposure program
 pachaas acre main faile exelarai campus main aath airkandishand amphitheatre classroom, computer centre, vishwastareey librori, teen atyaadhunik sabhaagaar, utkrisht khel or manoranjan suvidhaayen or chaatro tathaa staff ke aaraamdeh awaas hai
 The institute has plans for new campus expansion with better facilities which will be completed by January 2014
 exelarai ko ek anya tagaline-for da greater good-se bhi paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Every person in the institute seems to put it into reality
 abraham yaad karte hai, ‘‘pichley saal jab ek chaatr course paas karne main naakaam rahaa to institute ne use doosraa mauka diya
 But after failing again, we had to cut his name
 ’’ve bataate hai ki uske baad anya chaatro ne hastkshep kiya
 He collected donations among themselves for his good future 4
 5 lakh ru
 Mobilized
 unki bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue skool ne bhi us chaatr ko utana hi yogadan karne kaa faisla kiya
 XLRI was founded in 1949 by Father Quinn Enright of the Jesuit Society, whose primary objective is to teach ethics, honesty and professional excellence
 chif brands and sastenibility officer sunil vargeez kehete hai, ‘‘exelarai hamaare chaatro ko aisa vyaavhaarik anubhav pradaan karata he ki ve apane kariyar main aane vaali kisi bhi chunauti kaa saamana kar sakate hai
 In the modern business scenario, where ever a big business decision can put a human being in even more moral dilemma, we know that XLRI students will take the right path
 ’’bharat ke sabase pichde rajyon main se ek jharkhand main sthit hone kii vajah se institute apane chaatro ko asli hindustan or un chunautiyon kaa pratyaksh anubhav karaata he jinka saamana is desh ke vanchit log apane rosemara ke jivan main karte hai
 It also gives XLRI students insight to serve the country and society better

 bitman or superman bhi AT&T ke hongeyani ab popular disi comics jisane duniya ko film kejariye bitman or supermandie wo bhi AT&T kaa hissaa ho jayega
 Because DC Comics also falls within the Time Warner group

 Dams Department of Southern South Delhi Municipal Corporation has raised the issue of not cooperating with the Public Works Department under the Delhi Government while cleaning roads

 This is because of service pollution
 unhone kaha ki dilli main dust polution ko rokane main sweepar mashin kaa bahut hi ahm role he kyonki isse dhul hawa main nahin udati balki mashin main hi khinch lee jaati he
 Also, man power is also very less used
 emsidika kahana he central varj, channel or footpath khaskar ke esesain maarg, ring road, outer ring road, dhaula kuan, pankhaa road, malviya nagar or kai fliover bahut hi khasta halaat main he
 Small stone pieces fall on the roads, while the mastic default of flyovers is uprooted, the channels are either damaged or broken, making it difficult to sweep
 saath hi bataaya ki kooda or nirmaan kaary kaa malba bhi sadakon par hi padaa rahata he, wo bhi mashin dwaara safai main baadhak hota he
 The MCD will complain to the Lieutenant Governor, a letter was also written to the PW department on 10 October regarding this matter, but no response was received

 centre sarkaar dwaara bajet pesh hone ke baad dilli kii najar kejariwal sarkaar ke bajet satr he
 The question is, what will Delhi get from Manish Sisodia's box this year
 dilli sarkaar ke sutron ke mutabik march ke pehle saptaah main dilli kaa bajet vidhansabha main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 If 25 percent of the total budget is considered as sources for education, this time too 25 percent of the total budget of Kejriwal government can be given for education

 dilli sarkaar main shiksha vibhaag main salaahkaar aatishi marlena kaa kahana he ki shiksha is sarkaar kii praathamikta he
 Therefore, the government will give more attention to education in its third budget

 At the same time, many schemes may fall in the budget of Delhi, so some schemes may get more money than the budget

 On the other hand, fearing that the code of conduct will be implemented in view of the possible corporation elections in April, the Delhi government wants to present the budget in the first week of March itself

 unhone sarkaar se jati ke aadhaar par janaganana karaane kii maang kii
 He also said that if this is not done then it will be believed that BJP wants to divide the backward through the report of this committee

 Anupriya said that she also believed that the larger the number, the greater its share
 aarakshan to aabaadi ke anupaat main hi milanaa chahie

 ) The mother and wife of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian citizen jailed in Pakistan, met him in Islamabad on Monday
 ye mulaakaat ek aupchaarikta hi rahi, kyonki kulbhushan or parivaar ke bich shishe kii diwaar thi
 But now even more shocking facts are coming out
 islamabad main kulbhushan ke parivaar ke saath kii gai badasluki par bharat ne pakistan ko kadi latad lagaai he
 On Tuesday, the Indian Foreign Ministry held a press conference on the Kulbhushan Jadhav issue
 MEA pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne bataaya ki pakistani adhikariyon kii taraf se kulbhushan jadhav kii maa or patni ke kapade badalawaae gaye, press ko unke kareeb aane diya

 com / o6hkkoc7wk— ANI (@ani)december 26, 2017raveesh kumaar ne bataaya ki mulaakaat se pehle donon deshon ke adhikari sampark main the, sabhi kuch pehle hi tay kar diya gaya tha
 Despite this, the definitions of the meeting from Pakistan were violated
 kulbhushan ke parivaar ke paas pakistani press ko aane diya gaya, jo ki unpar jhuthe aarope vaale sawaal daag unhen pareshaan kar rahe the
 Whereas it was decided between the two countries that the media would not be allowed to come close
 paak ko latad lagaate hue raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki suraksha ke naam par kulbhushan kii patni-maa ke mangalsutra, bindi, kapade tak ko badalawa diya gaya
 Whenever Kulbhushan's mother tried to speak in Marathi to his son in his own language, he was repeatedly interrupted
 yahaan tak kii unke juute bhi nahin lautaae gaye
 The Foreign Ministry said that before the meeting, India's Deputy High Commissioner JP Singh was separated from the meeting, while it was already decided that he would be present
 haalanki, bhartiya adhikariyon ke tokane ke baad unhen shaamil hone diya gaya
 He told that Kulbhushan Jadhav is in a very worrying and troublesome situation
 aapako bataa den ki kulbhushan jadhav ke parivaar kii mangalvaar ko videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke nivas sthaan par unase mulaakaat kii
 Kulbhushan Jadhav's parents and wife attended the meeting
 videsh sachiv es jaishankar or videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar bhi sushamaa swaraj ke nivas sthaan par maujuud the
 The meeting lasted for 3 hours (9:30 am - 12:30 pm)

 i got a chance to meet Ratan Tata two times at a distance of ten years
 is mulaakaat se mere dimag main yah baat saaf taur par baith gai ki ve kisi protocol yaa oonche-neeche pad kii baat se bilkul bandhe nahin hote
 The first met at the Maharaja Lounge at the old international terminal of Indira Gandhi Airport in Delhi and the second, at the first line of the Regal Ballroom at the Trident Hotel in Mumbai while addressing US President Barack Obama's Indian business
 donon maukon par ve yun hi mere bagal kii khaali seat par aakar baith gaye or kisi ne gaur nahin kiya
 His democratic and open nature led to a series of interactions between us
 baatcheet ke ant main maine unase mere haal ke kuch aalekh / kitaaben padhgaye kaa anurodh kiya
 And i would like to admit that due to my own inhibitions i could not send them these materials
 mujhe ummid he or meraa maananaa he ki ve ise samajhenge
 i think the reason for such self-confidence and the nature of being away from showmanship is because of their upbringing amidst prosperity, studying in top schools and colleges, then returning to the shop floor, the usual employees of Tata Steel Work side by side
 duusare kaarobaari samooh vaale pariwaron ko bhi unka udhaaharan apnaanaa chahie, bajaae iske ki management ke sabase upar ke padon par apane kisi vanshaj ko laakar baitha diya jaae
 i believe that it was this experience and feedback that gave Ratan Tata the courage to persevere, when he became the chairman of the powerful satraps that controlled a large part of the Tata group's business
 is kaam ke liye na keval adamya saahas kii balki uddeshy kii spashtataa or doordarshee nazariye kii darkaar thi
 Apart from bringing flexibility in this, he managed to incorporate Tata's business into the global competition and made it into a real multinational company
 isse unke fauladi sankalp kaa hi pataa chalata he, jo aam taur par unke kam bolne vaale swabhaav or prasiddhi se dur rahane kii jaani-samajhi koshish kii vajah se ek tarah se chupa hi rahaa
 Due to his modernity, his visionary attitude and his concern for the country's progress, he appears at a height among his equal people
 shaayad is samrudh drushti kii vajah se hi maujuuda bhartiya kaarobaari duniya main unke mukaable bahut kam log thaharte hai
 They motivate their senior management to keep an eye on the long-term goal, with full confidence that the market will grow and these efforts will bear fruit in the future
 unhen desh-videsh, donon jagahon par jabardast pahchaan mili he, sirf isliye nahin ki unhone pehle se acchhee tarah se sthapit ek samrajya kaa vistaar kiya, balki isliye ki unke netritv main tata bhartiya pragati kaa paryaay ban gaya
 Moving on to global norms, he promoted research and research, emphasized technical depth and, most importantly, gave his senior management a sense of autonomy and ownership
 haalanki, unhone iske saath kathor javabdehi ko bhi shaamil kiya
 He chose the path of development of his brand of cars, hotels, software etc
 and established Tata's global presence
 is ranneeti par aage badhate hue ratan tata ne yah samaj liya ki bhartiya udyog lambey samay tak sangrakshanvaadi nitiyon kii aad nahin le saktaa
 In the midst of the ever-increasing interaction of the Indian economy with the world economy, he insisted on adopting global level competition whether a company is operating in the domestic market or in the foreign market
 yah aisi vajandaar ranneeti he jis par anya bhartiya kaarobaar samoohon ko bhi gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa chahie
 In the continued modernization of the Indian economy, he became the symbol of the most modern and advanced class of Indian society
 ve jis junun ke saath nimna madhyavarg kii jaruraton ke liye naino project, garib pariwaron ke liye sasta samaadhaan ‘‘svachh’’ water porifaire lekar aae or tata samooh kii companiyon tathaa parsi samudaay ke samarthan se chalane vaale kai foundation ke kaam main sahyog diya, usase bharat ke nivaasiyon ke prati unki chintaa jaahir hoti he
 Their approach was to provide the most advanced scientific and technological solutions to meet the needs of the poor and the less affluent
 yah un logon kii soch ke bilkul vipareet he jo haashie ke logon ke prati juthi dayaa dikhaate hai or samaadhaan ke rup main bas daan dena uchit samajhate hai
 One could argue that Ratan Tata's focus was almost entirely on building the Tata group and he did not pay enough attention to the broader issues facing the Indian corporate world
 apni duusari pari main ve apane kad or saamaajik pahunch kaa istemaal bhartiya udyog jagat main zyada aatm-niyaman or oonche naitik maanak apnaane ko prerit karne ke liye kar sakate hai
 This alone is expected to improve the functioning and the direction of the unfortunate decline in the quality of public services including law and order can be reversed
 kaaphi spasht he ki ve khud udhaaharan pesh karte hue netritv karte hai, na ki upadesh dekar yaa kisi masale par saarvajanik taur par raay jaahir kar
 When the case of the telecom sector was revealed, they too could not remain unaffected by the overall business environment in the country
 isse unhen is bhartiya kahawat kii sachaai kaa abhas ho gaya ki ‘‘kaajal kii kothri main kitna hi jatan karo, kaajal kaa daag bhai laage hi laage
 "I am confident that like me, millions of middle class Indians would also like to lead the Indian business in general and in particular to change the social image of big business houses
" nishchit rup se main yah suzav nahin de rahaa ki ve raajnneeti main shaamil ho jaaen (yah khyaal hi kyon aayaa?) lekin ve saadhaaran tareeke se bhartiya kaarobaar jagat kaa netritv is baat ke liye kar sakate hai ki ve desh main pragatisheel or naitik badlaav laane ke agua bane
 Given the many accolades and awards he has received and his immense international stature, Ratan Tata can also lead the efforts of global capitalism
 mujhe ummid he ki ve kuch prakhyat logon ke ek aise samooh kaa netritv karnaa upyukt samajhenge jo is drushti ko pesh kare ki global poonjeevaad badalte daur main zyada praasangik he or vah agle dashakon main bhi tikaa rahegaa

 Apart from this, we are feeling a lot

 Sometimes she tells all the pregnant girls in the office that Madam, if she has a son, she will definitely be fed sweets
 kabhi wo mujhase kahati he ki log chori kyon karte hai, kabhi wo puuchhati he ki pataa nahin yahaan par sabko kaamchori karne kii aadat kyon he, kabhi puuchhati he ki kya cement main sone se bukhaar aata he?to roj kii tarah main aaj bhi jab washroom gai to usne mujhe muskuraakar dekha or poochne lagi,''kya bachche bade hone ke baad apane maa-baap ko poochhate hai?'maine kaha, ''haa poochhate to hai, lekin kai bachche aise hai jo bade hone ke baad maa-baap kii sud tak nahin lete hai

 Every woman should stand on her own feet
 'meri ye baat use pasand nahin ai
 She started saying, 'madam, this thing is totally wrong for you

 If a man brings money in the house, then it is something else
 'maine poocha, 'aurat ko kyon paisa nahin kamaane chahie?'usne kaha, 'aadmi ke haath ke paise main barkat hoti he or ghar kii izzat bani rahati he

 dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ne petrol or dijal ke daam na ghataane par centre kii modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Actually, petrol and diesel are excluded from GST

 Deputy CM of Delhi Government Manish Sisodia reminded the Center of the price of crude oil on the question of reducing VAT
 aam aadmi party sarkaar philhal is baat kaa aankalan kar rahi he ki centre sarkaar kii apil ke baad koun-koun se rajya petrol or dijal ke daam kam kar rahe hai
 In Delhi, the question of reducing VAT on petrol and diesel, Paramneesh Sisodiane said that BJP does not work, only commits
 puri duniya main crude oil ke daam jis tarah se kam hue hai, us hisaab se centre sarkaar ko bhi petrol or dijal ke daam kam karnaa chahie
 Agreeing on some of the decisions taken in the GST Council meeting, Sisodia said that small businessmen will get relief from the changes in GST
 haalanki sisodiya ne bataaya ki unhone council main dedh karod se neeche ke vyapaar par teen maheene main ritern fil karne kaa virodh kiya tha
 However, returns above this have to be filed every month
 aise main agar teen maheene main ritern fil karne vaale chote vyapri ko input credit lenaa he, to lanbaa intjaar karnaa padegaa
 Manish Sisodia says that there is no need for IGST in the country
 sisodiya ke mutabik sirf do maheene se vyapaariyon kaa 70 hajaar karod rupee bank main rakhaa hua he
 Neither the state government nor the central government is able to use these funds deposited in the bank
 70 hajaar karod rupee bank main block ho gaya he
 In such a case, IGST is a big block
 is block ko hataane kii zarurat he

 chunavi mahaul main aarakshan kii samiksha kii baat kahkar sargarmi badhaane vaale bhagwat ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki jab tak saamaajik bhedbhaav rahegaa, tab tak aarakshan bana rahegaa
 During an event in Nagpur, Mohan Bhagwat clarified his earlier statement, 'the Sangh believes that as long as there is social discrimination, the reservation system will continue
 jis din saamaajik bhedbhaav samaapt ho gaya or jis din khud saamaajik bhedbhaav se peedit log aisa kahenge, usee din aarakshan kii vyavastha ko dur kiya jayega
 "the underprivileged class has endured discrimination", the union chief told those demanding abolition of reservation that for thousands of years the deprived sections have endured discrimination, so can we not bear the system of reservation for 100 years
 unhone kaha, 'hamen yah sahan karnaa chahie
 a society which does not have social equality can never progress
 yah sach he ki hamaare yahaan jatibhed hua he, hona nahin chahie tha, lekin hua he
 Mohan Bhagwat said that caste discrimination has done the work of dividing Indian society
 gauratlab he ki bihar chunaavon se purv mohan bhagwat kaa bayaan aayaa tha ki badali hui paristhitiyon main aarakshan kii samiksha honi chahie
 However, after the controversy over this statement, Bhagwat and all the leaders of the Sangh started talking about misinterpretation
 is bayaan ko bihar chunaav main lalu yadav or nitish kumaar ne khub bhunaaya
 And after the defeat in the election, it was said that the BJP had to bear the brunt of Bhagwat's anti-reservation statement
 aadesh main kaha gaya he ki virajpet ke vidhayak keji bopaiya ne yediurppa ko patr likhakar rajya ke kannada evam samskruti vibhaag dwaara tipu jayanti ke avasar par yojit kiye jane vaale vaarshik samarohon ko radd karne kaa anurodh kiya
 In the letter, he drew attention to the protest against such celebrations, especially in Kodagu district
 varsh 2015 main iske pehle aadhikarik aayojan ke dauraan kodagu jile main vyapak pradarshnon or hinsa main vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ke kaaryakarta katappa kii maut ho gai thi
 The BJP and right-wing organizations have been strongly opposed to the birth anniversary celebrations, calling Tipu a 'religious fundamentalist'

 Jaitley's poignancy in the speech

 ahamed ke nidhan ke baad bajet ko guuruuvaar tak ke liye taala ja saktaa he
 But the speaker has made it clear that the budget has to be presented, it is a constitutional responsibility
 aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he jab rail or aam bajet ek saath pesh kiye ja rahe hai
 However, the Congress has asked to postpone the budget for a day
 congress netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki aaj bajet pesh karnaa amanviya hoga
 First budget after demonetisation This time budget was special in many ways
 sarkaar ke saamne ek or arthvyavastha kii tarakkee ko raftaar dene kii chunauti thi to duusari ore notebandi ke maddenjar aam janata ko raahat dene par bhi jetali kaa dhyaan tha
 The importance of the budget was also increased in view of the upcoming assembly elections

 bansgaanv loksabhaa seat uttar pradesh ke sabase pichde sansadeey siton main se ek he or anya siton kii tarah yahaan par bhi zyaadaatar matadaata vikaas kaaryon kii tulana main jatigat paristhitiyon ko mahatv dete hue najar aa rahe hai or usee ke aadhaar par apane matadhikaar kaa istemaal karte hai
 However, due to being part of the parliamentary district Gorakhpur from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the importance of this seat increases
 gorakhpur ke saath-saath is seat ko jitaane kii jimmedaari siem yogi ke kandhon par he
 Since independence, this parliamentary seat reserved for the Scheduled Castes has been occupied by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) five times and its candidate Kamlesh Paswan has fielded this time with the intention of putting a hat-trick of victory
 kamalesh 2009 or 2014 main loksabhaa kaa chunaav jeet chuke hai
 If their eyes are on the hat-trick of electoral victory, then the battle of 5 years ago is being fought again, this time the electoral board has been separated, but the big faces in the field are the same
 sapa-basapa gathbandhanis baar loksabhaa chunaav ke tarikhon ke elaan se bahut pehle hi uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main us samay krantikari badlaav aayaa jab dhur-virdohi samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ne aapasi gathjod karte hue pradesh main ek saath chunaav ladane kaa faisla liya
 This parliamentary seat came under Bahujan Samaj Party's account under the alliance of both parties
 basapa ne pehle yahaan se doodhnath prasad ko ummidavaar banaaya tha, lekin vah yahaan ke liye bahari the or unka party kaaryakartaaon ke saath unka talmail nahin ban paa rahaa tha
 For this reason, the party took the feedback from the people at the organization level and then took a big decision and changed its candidate
 basapa ne doodhnath kii jagah purv mantri sadal prasad ko maidan main utaarne kaa elaan kiya
 Former minister Sadal Prasad has been a staunch leader of local politics and he had given a tough fight to Kamlesh Paswan while fighting on the BSP ticket in the 2014 elections
 bijepi ummidavaar kamalesh paswan ke chote bhai or bansgaanv vidhayak vimalesh paswan ne ajtak se kaha ki jatigat aadhaar par kiye gaye gathbandhan kaa yahaan se safaya ho jayega
 Kamlesh ji will score a hat-trick of victory while getting a big win
 pichhali baar kii tulana main is baar unhen badi jeet milegi
 However, unlike Vimlesh Paswan, local journalist and close observer of Gorakhpur's politics, Sunil Pandey says that the SP-BSP alliance in Bansgaon is strong and the BJP is getting a tough fight from here
 sunil pandey kehete hai ki paswan parivaar yahaan se 15 saal saansad rahaa, lekin yahaan par koi thos vikaas kaary nahin hua
 a witness to the political legacy of the election battle in Bansgaon came at a time when the nomination of Congress candidate Kush Saurabh was rejected
 is sansadeey seat par kul 11 ummidavaaron ne parchaa daakhil kiya tha, lekin ab vahaan se mahaj 4 ummidavaaron ke bich hi ladaai he
 Apart from Kamlesh Paswan and Sadal Prasad, Surendra Prasad of the Progressive Samajwadi Party (lohia) and Independent candidate Lalchand Prasad are trying their luck here
 ek tarah se yah seat raajnneetik viraasat kii gavaah banati ja rahi he kyonki isse pehle 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unki maa subhavati paswan ne jeet hasil kar loksabhaa main parivaar kii ore se pehali baar kadam rakhaa tha
 It is different that Sambhavati was in the Samajwadi Party then and won on his ticket
 kamalesh ke pita om prakaash paswan 90 ke dashak main gorakhpur kshetra ke bade netaaon main shumaar kiye jate the or vah maniram vidhansabha kshetra (1989-1991 or 1993) se vidhayak rahe
 But he was assassinated while campaigning in Bansgaon in the 1996 Lok Sabha election
 hatya ke baad unki patni subhavati devi maidan main utrin or jeet hasil kii
 Financially poor local issues of Bansgaon include unemployment, agriculture plight
 cement sector main kaam karne ke baad khud kii company banane or kuch maheenon main raajnneeti main entry karne ja rahe vinay pratap singh kaa kahana he ki bansgaanv kshetra pradesh ke pichde ilaakon main aata he or yahaan vikaas naam kii koi cheez nahin he
 Like every time, development begins and ends on caste
 'sapa-basapa gathbandhan beasar'kshetra main vikaas kaary kii baat karte hue vidhayak vimalesh paswan ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kehete hai ki kamalesh ji ne jo vaade kiye the use centre kii modi sarkaar kii madad se puure kar daale hai
 On the basis of development work done in the area under the leadership of Modi ji, BJP is going to get a bumper victory in Gorakhpur along with Bansgaon
 vidhayak vimalesh is samay bade bhai ke liye tabadatod chunaav prachaar main jute hai or unka maananaa he sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko yahaan se kuch hasil nahin hoga
 The Rashtriya Lok Dal is also included in the alliance with the SP-BSP
 rashtriya lokdal ke rajya pravaktaa or bansgaanv se taalluk rakhane vaale anshuman singh kehete hai ki is baar gathbandhan ke kaaran kshetra main kaante kii ladaai he
 However, the margin of defeat and win is not going to be much
 duusari ore, patrkaar sunil pandey kehete hai ki bansgaanv main pichley 10 saalon main koi thos kaam nahin hua
 He claims that leaving a state school in Chillupar, no concrete work was done in the area
 yahaan kii sadaken tuuti hui hai, or bijli bhi kam aati he
 This time the condition of BJP is looking thin here
 vahiin sthaneey patrkaar durgesh yadav bhi maanate hai ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa asar bansgaanv main dikh rahaa he
 Sadal Prasad is a more powerful leader than Kamlesh
 'sadal prasad kaa vyaktitv'sapa ke saath gathbandhan, basapa kii ore se pratyaashee badale jane, congress pratyaashee kaa tikat khaarij hone or khud sadal prasad ke sthaneey hone ke kaaran is baar chunaav kantedaar ho gaya he
 Sadal Prasad was a minister of state in the BSP government in 2007, winning the election from the Bansgaon assembly seat (reserved)
 sadal prasad ke bare main anshuman singh kaa kahana he ki unka saral vyaktitv hona bhi unke paksh main jaataa he, jabaki kamalesh kshetra main kam hi rahete hai or sthaneey logon se kam milanaa unke khilaaf ja saktaa he
 Talking about the caste equation of Bansgaon parliamentary seat, there are the most voters of Other Backward Classes (OBC)
 yahaan par obisi ke 8
 34 lakhs then 2 of scheduled castes
 50 lakh matadaata hai
 There are 5 lakh voters from the upper castes, while about 1 from the Muslim society
 50 lakh matadaata hai
 Durgesh Yadav believes that the caste factor will work in Bansgaon
 kamalesh or sadal donon hi ek hi birdari se aate hai, lekin sadal kii savarna varg main acchhee pakad he or unase lagaataar milte-rahete hai, aise main sadal prasad kamalesh se unniis sabit ho sakate hai
 The Lok Sabha constituency consists of 5 assembly seats including Chillupar in Gorakhpur, Bansgaon, Chaurichora and Rudrapur, Barhaj assembly constituencies of Deoria
 kya is baar bhi modi laharpradhanmantri narendra modi deshbhar main chunaav prachaar kar rahe hai or wo apane naam par hi chunaav lard rahe hai
 In such a situation, Bansgaon MLA Vimlesh Paswan claims that not only Bansgaon is the Modi wave in the entire Purvanchal and the state and on their own we will win again and the government will be formed at the center, but Anshuman Singh claims that there is a Modi wave here there is no problem
 2014 main modi kaa jo jalawaa tha wo is baar nahin dikh rahaa
 Journalist Durgesh also believes that this time there is no such thing as Modi wave
 sunil pandey bhi durgesh kii baat se ittefaq rakhte hai or kehete hai modi lahar is baar beasar sabit ho rahaa he
 Talking about the parliamentary history of Bansgaon, the Congress has won this Lok Sabha seat six times in the 14 Lok Sabha elections held since 1962
 jabaki bijepi ne 1991 ne yahaan se jeet kaa khaataa kholaa tha
 Then Raj Narayan became MP on a BJP ticket
 uske baad 2009 or 2014 main lagaataar 2 baar bijepi yahaan se chunaav jeet rahi he
 By the way, this seat is known as Mahavir Prasad, who was once one of the big Dalit leaders of the state
 vah yahaan se 4 baar loksabhaa chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab rahe, lekin ek baar unhen shikast bhi mili
 Mahavir Prasad last won in 2004
 sapa-basapa ko mili vot se aage bijepiyah seat om prakaash paswan ke liye bhi jaani jaati he, jinaki hatya ke baad unki patni subhavati paswan (1996) yahaan se saansad baniin
 After his mother's political retirement, his son Kamlesh Paswan has been winning the Lok Sabha elections for two consecutive terms (2009 and 2014)
 bansgaanv sansadeey seat (surakshit) par 2014 main hue chunaav kii baat karen to bijepi ke kamalesh paswan ne basapa ke sadal prasad ko haraaya tha
 Then Kamlesh got a total of 47 in the election
 6 fisadi vot yani 4,17,959 mat mili the jabaki sadal prasad ko 2,28,443 (26
 0%) votes received
 is tarah se kamalesh ne 1,89,516 (21
 6%) won this by a margin of votes
 sapa ke gorakh prasad paswan tisare sthaan par rahe jinhen 15
 Got 2% votes (1,33,675)
 maidan main kul 12 ummidavaar the
 This time the SP-BSP are contesting the elections, if the votes received 5 years ago are added, then this alliance is 36
 8 fisadi mat hasil hue the jabaki bijepi ko akele 47
 Got 6% votes
 upi main yogi sarkaar kii sahyogi suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke adhyaksh om prakaash rajbhar ne yahaan par sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kiya he
 In this way, if the votes are cast this time also like last time, then Kamlesh will not face any problem in winning ahead of the SP-BSP alliance
 haalanki kaha ja rahaa he ki sthaneey savarna varg kaa ek bada tabaka saansad kamalesh paswan se naaraaz he, lekin pradhanmantri narendra modi kii baat aane par is varg ke matadaata bijepi ke paksh main aa jate hai
 So at the same time Sadal Prasad has a good hold in the upper castes as well as OBC and SC
 rajya main badale raajnneetik sameekaran main bijepi ke liye aage kaa rasta pichhali baar kii tarah is baar aasaan hota dikh rahaa he
 Although the contest could not be triangular due to the absence of Congress in the electoral battle here, it will definitely be interesting

 The child's mother told in an interview to Hindustan Times that initially she felt that the child is very tall, so it is happening

 He said that the growth of the child is not normal and that is when it was decided to go to the doctor

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator The bjp's oldest ally Shiv Sena announced on Tuesday that it will split from the NDA and contest elections in the 2019 Lok Sabha and Maharashtra assembly elections
 shivasena ke is farmaan se bijepi beparwaah he
 No party leader took this matter seriously
 khud maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis jo ki shivasena ke dam par sarkaar chalaa rahe hai, wo bhi isse beparwaah dikhe or ajtak se baatcheet main unhone kaha ki wo shivasena se is tarah kii baton ke aadi ho gaye hai 
 Uddhav Thackeray, the national president of the Shiv sena-bjp since 2014, said in a meeting of the National Executive on Tuesday, "I swear that i will contest elections in all the states of the country on my own
" chaahe jeeten yaa haaren, lekin chunaav apane dam par hi ladenge
 Explain that for the last three decades, BJP and Shiv Sena have been fighting Congress together
 donon kabhi haare to kabhi congress-ensipi ko haraaya bhi
 But the alliance remained as it was
 bijepi ke sahyogi ek-ek kar usase dur hote gaye, lekin shivasena paas hi rahi
 But in the last assembly election of Maharashtra, BJP split from Shiv Sena and contested
 haalanki chunaav ke baad donon phil milakar sarkaar chalaa rahe hai lekin dosti main jo daraar padi wo jas kii tas he
 The Shiv Sena has been continuously attacking the BJP since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 itnaa hi nahin bijepi sarkaar kii nitiyon or piem narendra modi par nijee hamale jitne bade shivasena ne kiye utane to vipakshi dal congress ne bhi nahin kiye
 Despite this, the alliance of the two parties remains intact
 ab jab shivasena ne mangalvaar ko party kii kaaryakaarani main prastaav paas karke 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main maharashtra kii sabhi loksabhaa or sabhi vidhansabha siton par chunaav ladane or akele dam par 25 loksabhaa siten or 150 vidhansabha siten jeetne kaa daawa kiya, to is baat ko lekar bijepi beparwaah dikhi
 Shiv Sena's helplessness with BJP: Actually BJP knows that it is Shiv Sena's helplessness in the present situation
 shivasena agar alag hoti he to usase na sirf centre balki rajya kii satta se bhi haath dhonaa padegaa
 Due to ideological differences, the Shiv Sena will not be able to support the hand of Congress
 muslim matadaata bijepi or shivasena donon ko ek hi taraazoo ke palle main rakhkar dekhte hai
 Similarly NCP will not stand with Shiv Sena as there is a rivalry between the two for Maratha vote
 aise main bijepi is baat se bakhubi waakif he ki shivasena ke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 That is why the party is not paying attention to Uddhav's oath
 shivasena se zyada badi bijepichaahe desh ho yaa maharashtra, bijepi ab pehle vaali bijepi nahin rah gai he
 Along with the country's power, BJP also has governments in 18 states
 rahi baat maharashtra kii to bijepi ne pichley vidhansabha chunaav main shivasena se alag hokar apni takat naap chuki he
 BJP had won the maximum 122 seats in the assembly elections
 vahiin shivasena ke khate main 63 siten ain
 The Lok Sabha elections were fought together when BJP and 18 seats were won by Shiv Sena out of 48 seats in the state
 ab bijepi is baat ko maanakar chal rahi he ki shivasena loksabhaa main alag hoti he to wo vidhansabha chunaav kii tarah sabhi siton par ladegi or pehle se zyada siten use milengi
 The BJP is believed to be the reason behind not giving importance to Shiv Sena
 centre sarkaar ne bijepi saansad varun gandhi kii suraksha or badhaane kii apil khaarij kar di he
 The matter raised in Parliament also denied the allegations of Varun's mother Maneka Gandhi, which she had made in a letter to the Prime Minister
 menka ne us patr main likhaa tha ki grih mantralay varun ke khataron par dhilaa ravaiya apana rahaa he
 Earlier on Tuesday, BJP also raised the issue of increasing the security of Varun in Parliament
 loksabhaa main party kii upanetaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki varun gandhi kii jaan ko khatra he, isliye unhen behatar suraksha milani chahie
 At present, 29-year-old Varun Gandhi has been given security of y-koti, according to which he has been given 24-hour security guard, an escort and a pilot vehicle
 sutron ke mutabik samiksha ke baad is suraksha ko samuchit paaya gaya he
 In a letter to the Prime Minister, Maneka also mentioned the arrest of the sharp shooters of the Chhota Shakeel gang by the Delhi Police, that they wanted to target Varun
 haalanki police ne is daawey se inkaar kiya
 Concerned over the government's attitude, Menaka said in his letter, "I am surprised by your government's indifferent attitude
" grih mantralay ne in khataron ko kaaphi halke main liya he, jisase main achambhit hum
 "he said," When Varun met the Home Minister, he was quite rude and careless about his duties and informed him that he could not protect every man in the country

 Does your green balcony suddenly dry up? Does this also happen to you that the plants you plant with great fervor remain safe for a few days but slowly start drying up? If yes, then it is possible that you are also making the same mistakes that usually everyone does
 balakani garden kaa shauk rakhane vaale aksar aisi galtiyaan kar jate hai, lekin agar aap chaahate hai ki aapaki balakani hari bani rahe to, jarurat he sirf thodaa sa dhyaan dene kii:1- chote-chote gamalon kaa dher:aksar aisa hota he ki balakani kosunderbanane ke chakkar main log chote-chote gamalon kaa dher laga lete hai
 No matter how much beauty will grow from it, however, there is no complete development of plants
 aisi sthiti main koi bhi paudha apni vaastavik growth nahin kar paata he or uski khubsuurati adhuri hi rah jaati he
 It is better to put some larger sized pots, so that the plants can get full space to grow
 2-sahi gamalon kaa chayan:gamalon kaa sahi chayan kiya janaa behad jaruri he
 Once the plant is planted in it, its growth depends on the size of the pot
 gamale ke nichle bhaag main pani suraakh hona chahie, jisase atirikt pani aasaani se baahar chalaa jaae
 With this, the right choice of soil to be filled in the pot is very important
 gamale main mitti bharbhari bhari honi chahie na kii thuns-thunskar
 3- Selection of wrong plant: To keep the garden green, choosing the right plant is also important
 paudhe kaa chayan karne se purv balakani kaa achachhi tarah nirikshan kar lenaa chahie
 Only after this, healthy plants should be purchased from the nursery
 paudhe kharidne se purv aapako pataa hona chahie ki aapaki balakani main kitni dhoop aati he or kis paudhe ko kitni dekharekh kii jarurat he
 If there is strong sunlight in your balcony and you have inadvertently bought shed-loving plants, it is difficult to keep these plants green for a long time
 4- pani kaa sahi anupaat:paudhe lagane ke baad usamen pani dete rahanaa ek nishchit prakriya he lekin, aapako ye jaanakar aashcharya hoga ki gamalon main lage zyaadaatar paudhe pani kii kami yaa phir uske atyadhik maatra main hone kii vajah se sad jate hai
 Many times people forget to water the plants regularly or sometimes they add so much water that the roots of the plant rot
 paudhe ke liye donon hi sthiti buree he
 5 - Selection of the right pesticide: The plant dries even in the event of not choosing the right pesticide
 kai baar aisa bhi hota he ki paudhe main koi rog lag jaataa he or sahi samay par uskaa pataa nahin chal paata he, jisase paudha suukh jaataa he
 Therefore, it is important that the plant is maintained and in case of doubt, an expert is consulted

 When Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, China had declared his election victory with open arms
 pehali baat to yah thi ki chini netritv ke liye modi koi anjaan shaks nahin the kyonki gujarat ke mukhyamantri rahete hue ve chaar baar us desh kaa daura kar chuke the or china ke model kii khuli saraahna kar chuke the
 Apart from this, there was another thing about which China was sufficiently aware and was cited by a Chinese strategist Liu Jongui in his much publicized column written after the election as a personal discrimination against Washington by Shmodi, referred to in the 2002 riots
 His visa was later banned
 liyu ne apane lekh main yah to kaha tha ki pradhanmantri ke rup main modi nai dilli or washington ke bich tanaav nahin paidaa karenge lekin anya chiniyon kii tarah unhone bhi ummid kii thi ki modi sarkaar america ke saath rishton par punarvichaar jarur karegi
 After half a year, it has become clear that Modi has actually reviewed India's equation with Washington, but not in the way that China had expected, but he has taken a completely opposite view
 yahi baat china ke liye chaunkaane vaali he
 In the light of US President Barack Obama's visit to India, China is taking stock of the changing circumstances in the context of the complex trilateral relations of the three countries
 ganatantr diwas kii parade main mukhya atithi kaa nyotaa obama ko die jane kaa kadam (jo pehali baar kisi america raashtrapati ko mila he) china ke liye aashcharya se kam nahin tha kyonki vahaan ke netaaon or afasaron ko yah yaad he ki pichhali baar or iklauta chini atithi bharat main 1958 main aayaa tha
 Chinese analysts see this invitation as a new trend that began with Modi's warm-up meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the most unpopular foreign leader within China due to tensions between China and Japan
 
 iske baad sitambar main china ke raashtrapati shi jinping kii bharat yatra ke dauraan seemaa par hui tanatani ne donon deshon ke bich rishton ko tazaadam karne kii apekshaaon ko patari se utaar diya jisase is rujhaan kii pushti hui
 In November, Modi turned down the invitation sent by Chinese President Xi to attend the APEC summit, adding to China's fears
 shanghai ke international history centre main vidwaan yaao yuanmei ne haal hi main likhe apane lekh main kaha tha, ‘‘apek main modi kii gaiyr-maujuudagi ne logon ko chaunkaa diya
 Some people believe that this is a sign of deterioration in relationships
 ’’sarkaar ko paraamarsh dene vaale singhua uniwarsity ke ek ranneetik visheshgy yaan jutang maanate hai ki aise bhay bevajaah hai
 He told India Today, "india is a global force and will not be a follower of any faction
 ’’ america or japan ke saath milakar ek china virdohi ranneeti ke tahat bharat kaa jhukaav china ke sainya pratishthan ke liye sanathan chintaa kaa vishay rahaa he
 According to a top Indian official, "there is no basis for it because China's engagement with America on almost every subject is much deeper than the relationship between India and America
" ’’yaan maanate hai ki bharat ‘‘ahm deshon ke bich santulan baitaane kaa kaam karata rahegaa
 "in this sense, Modi's diplomacy has so far kept China in the lurch
 bharat ne china ko asia infrastracchar investment bank banane kii yojana main apana samarthan diya tha, jiske tahat donon deshon ke bich paanch daur kii vaarta hui thi
 This was done despite American opposition to this bank
 iske saath hi china kii ‘‘meritime silk root’’ yojana ke virodh main bharat khadaa rahaa jiskaa uddeshy kshetra main china ke prabhutv ko badhanaa tha
 This shows that Modi's government does not care much about whether his actions are hurting China's sentiments
 ab tak aisa lag rahaa he ki bhram main hone ke chalate china modi ko riyaayat die hue he
 Those who made a fuss over Modi's visit to Japan were alerted by the Liberation newspaper of the Communist Party of China with a sensible sentence, "japan may be excited about Modi because he will join him to control China Desires but Modi is interested in Japan's investment and technology
 is tarah agar donon kii manshaaon ke hisaab se akalan karen to ham paaenge ki bharat or japan aise yugal kii tarah hai jo sote to ek hi bistar par hai lekin sapane bilkul alahada dekhte hai

 The blackberry mobile phone maker, Research in Motion (RIM), said on Tuesday that any drastic steps taken by New Delhi would adversely affect Indian business

 RIM has already given Indian authorities access to its consumer services from Javari, but does not want to bend over the issue of its enterprise emails
 apane udhyami upabhoktaaon ko bheji ek tippanee main blueberi utpaadak ne kaha he ki company bharat kii rashtriya suraksha kii praathamikta kaa puraa samarthan evam swaagat karti he
 But at the same time RIM has said that the code language is important to remain in the market in today's world and Indian authorities have acknowledged its importance in various meetings with representatives of the company
 aarm ne kaha he ki is par kisi bhi tarah kaa pratibandh lagane se desh ke aarthik vikaas or outsorcig udyog par asar padegaa
 RIM has said that the company is ready to discuss any policy changes
 lekin chunki anya pratispardhi companiyaan bhi bharat main kuta bhashaa kaa istemaal kar rahi hai, lihaaja unhen bhi samiksha ke daayre main laayaa janaa chahie
 RIM has said that competing companies using code language have tried to take advantage of this situation, as the Indian administration is focusing its attention on rim's enterprise service
 aarm ke anusaar, bharat main kuta bhashaa kaa istemaal karne vaali companiyon main nokia, google, appal, hevlett-packard, microsoft, or cisco shaamil hai
 In its remarks, RIM has mentioned the January 31 deadline to provide access to its consumer services in India

 to phir film 'udata punjab' main kats lagane se pehle sensor board ne kya sochaa hoga
 
 
 It is known that the censor board is the mother-father of films
 to 'protection' or 'care' ke naate kuch to uske dimag main bhi aayaa hoga ki kyon is film ko yahaan-vahaan se kutra jaae
 Now we have nothing in the logical mind
 magarsensor bordki tarah sochaa to kuch points par dimag kii batti jal gai
 You look and tell whether agree or not -1
 kyonki hamen pedo ke aasapaas vaala naach-gaanaa pasand hastage par shahid kii bold vaali parformens shaayad sensor board ko na pachi ho
 They think that the rain and the dance around the trees and the romantic audience want to see
 padhein : pehle bhi sensor board ke faislon par hue hai vivaad2
 Because we are gentle country abuses
 
 
 are yaar ham shaleen desh hai
 The conversation may be furious, but the censor board must think what is needed to be shown on the screen
 kaisaa he 'udata punjab' kaa trailor, dekhen3
 Because the truth is not so big that it can be shown on the big screen, films are the mirror of society, but the censor board considers how any truth can be so big that it can be shown on the big screen
 or kin filmon ke naam par hua he bavaal, yahaan jaane4
 Because Tommy cannot be the name of a star, now Anurag gave Shahid's character the name
 bataao ye kaise mumkin ho saktaa he!5
 Because there is no issue related to the youth, the Sensor Board would think that if the youth remains confused, then it is a point to raise the issues related to them
 
 
 6
 Because nothing appears on the Internet, the Sensor Board has not yet understood that Young Generation i for I, not Internet, understands
 sensor kii 'sanskari kanchi' kitni sahi he7
 Because even after 89 cuts, there is something left after watching the film, there are 89 cuts in the film
 agar yah sach he to bas itnaa bataa do yaar ki ab dekhne ko bachaa kya he
