 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad has taken a hard stand on the construction of the disputed land at Ram temple in Ayodhya
 is bare mensantasamaj ke saath milakarviechapine plan taiyaar kar liya he
 According to this, the Sant Samaj will meet the President and the Prime Minister
 vahiin, santon ne ram mandir ke nirmaan par centre sarkaar se adhyadesh laane ke liye dabaav banane kaa faisla kiya he
 Saints gave ultimatum: In a meeting organized by VHP in Delhi on Saturday, saints and saints from all over the country gave a four-month ultimatum to the Modi government for the construction of Ram temple
 santon ne saaf kaha he ki sarkaar 31 janvari tak mandir nirmaan kaa rasta talaashe
 Saints said that until January 31, the government does not take any decision, then on February 1, a further strategy will be chalked out in the Parliament of Religions
 viechpi kaa ram mandir ko lekar planvishwa hindu parishad ne shuukravaar ko santon kii samiti ke saath dilli main baithak kar ram mandir ke nirmaan ko lekar prastaav paas kiya
 Apart from this, Sant Samaj has also prepared a strategy to create such an environment in the country
 iske tahat november maheene main desh ke sabhi saansadon se santon ne mulaakaat kaa program banaaya he taaki ramamandir nirmaan ke mudde ko sansad main uthaaen
 Apart from this, from 6 December to 18 December (geeta Jayanti), saints in temples and gurdwaras across the country will go and create an environment for the construction of Ram temple
 'teen talaak par adhyadesh to mandir ke liye kyon nahin'sant samaaj rajyon main dharmik or saamaajik sansthaaon ke saath-saath desh ke sabhi rajyon ke rajyapal se is mudde par mulaakaat kar unhen janabhaawanaaon se avgat karaayenge
 Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Vishokanand demanded that before the law, the government should bring an ordinance for the construction of Ram temple, just like three divorces
 haalanki,ayodhyamaamle main muslim pakshakaar ikbaal ansaari ne kaha he ki agar sarkaar santon ke dabaav main adhyadesh laati he to hamaara bharosa uth jayega
 SP raised the question, Sant Samaj has chosen such a time of campaign for Ram temple, when the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be in full swing in the country
 yahi vajah he ki santon ke ram mandir abhiyaan ko siyasat ke nazariye se bhi dekha jane laga he
 Samajwadi Party spokesperson Sunil Sajan told Aaj Tak that at present, the Modi government is surrounded by issues like farmers, inflation and employment
 bijepico lagaataa he ki 2019 ke chunaav main in muddon kaa saamana kaise karegi
 In such a situation, BJP is taking up the issue of Ram Mandir with the help of VHP and Sant Samaj for attention from these issues
 unhone kaha ki 2014 main jab modi sarkaar satta main ai thi, to is mudde ko kyon nahin uthaaya gaya
 Now that the election is on the head and the government is surrounded by public issues, they have started resorting to Ram
 ye log bhagwaan ram ke bhakton kaa abhiyaan nahin he balki bijepi or sangh bhakton kaa he
 The SP leader said that the question arises as to whether the country will run by the constitution or by faith

 Togadia said the BJP came to power seeking votes in the name of Ram Mandir, but after sitting in the chair, she forgot the issue
 unhone kaha, 'main pichley chaar saalon se sadan main kanoon paarit karke ram mandir kaa nirmaan karne kii maang karata rahaa hum lekin aresas or bijepi ne meri aawaaj dabaane kii koshish kii
 We chose Narendra Modi to advocate the Ram temple, but he became an advocate of Muslims

 US President Donald Trump separated the US from the historic Paris Climate Agreement
 trump kaa kahana he ki is samjhaute main bharat or china ke liye sakht praavdhaan nahin kiye gaye hai, jabaki ye donon desh pradooshan rokane ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe hai
 In this way, the United States broke away from international efforts to combat global warming

 ’ trump ne kaha ki vah chaahate hai ki jalwaayu parivartan ko lekar paris samjhaute main america hiton ke liye ek uchit samjhauta ho

 Announcing the separation of the US from the deal, Trump also said that he would renegotiate the Paris Agreement, so that a fair settlement could be reached in the interests of the US and its people

 unhone aarope lagaaya ki bharat or china apane koyala utpaadan ke str ko doguna karenge
 Earlier, US Vice President Mike Pence said that Donald Trump is taking these steps to make America great again
 trump ke kehane kaa matlab yah tha ki ab vah america kii sharton par jalwaayu samjhauta chaahate hai
 Trump said he wants a compromise that protects America's industrial interests and saves Americans' jobs
 trump ne apane chunavi agenda main bhi america ko paris jalwaayu samjhaute se alag karne ko bhi shaamil kiya tha
 With this step, he also fulfilled his election promise

 (agenciyon se input) Bharatiya Janata Party President Amit Shah has strongly attacked the Congress on the issue of terrorism
 amit shah ne kaha ki aise samay jab puri duniya aatankwaad or aatanki masood ajahar ko lekar bharat ke saath he to congress or kuch raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon ke bayaan dushman kii madad kar rahe hai
 Amit Shah also asked the Congress why 25 terrorists were released when they were in government in 2010
 bijepi adhyaksh ne apane blog main likhaa ki aatanki masood ajahar ko lekar pakistan par jis dhang se vaishvik str par dabaav bana he, vah abhootpurv he
 Pakistan is under heavy pressure regarding Masood Azhar and his terrorist organization
 duniya ke tamaam desh or vaishvik sanghathan bharat ke saath khadey hai
 Pakistan is engaged in any way to protect its credibility
 unhone kaha ki aisi sthiti main jab pakistan dabaav kii sthiti main aayaa he, tab desh ke andar congress sahit kuch raajnneetik dalon dwaara uthaae ja rahe sawaalon se aatanki saraparaston ko madad mil rahi he
 Amit Shah said that it is unfortunate that the Congress is making the Kandahar plane hijacking incident of 1999 as a weapon of its levelless politics, which was an extremely sensitive and at-risk life of more than 170 people
 in logon main kuch log duusare deshon ke bhi the, jinaki suraksha hamaari jimmedaari thi
 Rahul Gandhi is asking the Modi government why the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had left Masood Azhar by misleading the people of the country and showing insensitivity towards the lives of those people
 unhone kaha ki kya vaaki yah aisa sawaal he, jo abtak anuttarit he
 Does the Congress not know that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee convened an all-party meeting to discuss the subject when the hijacking took place? At that meeting, Congress President Sonia Gandhi herself and former Prime Minister Dr
 manmohan singh maujuud rahe the
 Accepting the psyche of the country and taking the priority of protecting the lives of those stranded in the aircraft, it was decided after the consent of all political parties that the lives of all those who are stranded in the aircraft are more important to us
 ant main sabhi dalon ne sarvasammati se masood ajahar ko saunpane tathaa apane logon ko waapas laane kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya
 Amit Shah said that this was the demand of the people of the country
 jokhim main fanse logon ko nikalne kii hamaari praathamikta thi, hamane vahi kiya, jo tab ekmaatr sambhav rasta tha
 This step was not taken in any 'goodwill gestures'
 yahaan tak ki us samay ke videsh mantri jaswant singh, jinke putr ab congress main hai, ne 2009 main die gaye ek saakshaatkaar main kaha tha ki sarvadaleey baithak main sonia gandhi or manmohan singh kii sahmati thi
 Today, Congress and Rahul Gandhi are not only showing insensitivity by questioning that incident but also questioning the conscience of senior leaders of their party
 unhone kaha ki is gaiyr-jaruri mudde ko uthaakaar congress ne itihaas main hui aisi rihaayiyon par bahes ched di he, jo khud congress ke upar sawaal khadey karne vaale hai
 This debate neither begins nor ends with the release of Masood Azhar
 yah suchi badi he, jisapar charchaa ho to congress kaa daaman daagdar najar aayega
 Ten years before the Kandahar plane hijacking incident, the country's home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed's daughter, Rubaiyah Saeed, was abducted by militants in the Kashmir Valley
 iske badale unhone 10 aatankiyon ko chhodane kii maang kii thi
 The government accepted that demand and the terrorists were released
 yah bhi gudwil jescher nahin tha
 'why Congress left 25 terrorists' Amit Shah said that Congress should tell why 25 terrorists were released on May 28, when Congress was in government in 2010? At that time there was neither such a situation nor any such pressure, but in the name of improving relations with Pakistan, the Congress UPA-2 government released 25 terrorists
 jaananaa jaruri he ki in 25 aatankiyon main ek aatanki aisa bhi tha, jisko 1999 main bhi nahin choda gaya tha
 All these 25 terrorists are associated with terrorist organizations like jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba
 in chode gaye aatankwaadiyon main se ek shahid latif aage chal kar pathankot aatanki hamale kaa mukhya handler bana
 Today, the Congress, who questioned the consensus decision taken in a very sensitive situation for its politics, will answer why these terrorists were released? BJP President said that in fact Congress policy is always about terrorism, separatism and Naxalism Is wavering khud congress kii varisht netaa shila dikshit ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki manmohan singh kii aatankwaad par niti modi sarkaar kii sakht nitiyon kii tulana main dhili thi
 Sheila Dixit has made a natural statement
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki jab congress kii sarkaar desh main das saal tak thi, tab mumbai, dilli, jaipur sahit desh ke alag-alag hisson main aatanki vaaradaaten aam thim
 But in the last five years after the Modi government came to power in 2014, we have succeeded in keeping the militants around the border
 desh kii aantarik suraksha main aatankiyon dwaara send laga paanaa ab asambhav jaisaa ho gaya he
 The Modi government's policy on the country's border is 'zero tolerance' against terrorism
 aaj agar koi aatanki aane kii koshish karata he athwa koi aatanki vaardaat hoti he, to bharat ke vir jawan uskaa munhtod jawaab unke mul tak ja kar dete hai
 Amit Shah said that it is true that while in power, the Congress, which adopts a wavering policy on terrorism, does not leave any chance of having the back of terrorism, separatism and Naxalism in opposition
 tukade-tukade gang ke saath congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa khadaa hona or unka samarthan karnaa, iskaa pratyaksh udhaaharan he
 Will the Congress answer why Sonia Gandhi cried bitterly after the terrorists were killed in the Batla House encounter in 2008? In the Modi government, if there were any efforts to tighten them all, then it was natural for them to be furious, the Congress's fury also started coming out
 agar sab kuch yojana ke mutabik hota he, to ve congress ke satta main aane par pradhanmantri ban sakate hai
 i can say without knowing Rahul Gandhi that he would hesitate to take responsibility of the government
 or tab yahi shaks rahul kaa manmohan singh hoga
 "this is to say that of a Congress general secretary, which he naturally says on the condition of not disclosing the name

 This is his second innings in politics

 He was born in a Gujarati family of Titlagarh, Odisha
 unka mul naam satyanarayan gangaaraam pitroda he
 He has been the head of the National Knowledge Commission of India and has served as an advisor to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on public information, infrastructure and innovation
 isi saal unhone odisha sarkaar ke soochna praudyogiki salaahkaar kaa pad choda he
 Unlike many others, his association with the nehru-gandhi family has remained intact for years
 rahul haalanki unase takreeban teen dashak chote hai, par unhen unke pehle naam se pukaarte hai
 Many young Congress leaders attribute the recent change in Rahul Gandhi's image to Pitroda
 bataate hai, party ke videsh mahakme ke adhyaksh ne hi america kii kai jagahon par rahul ke bhaashanon kaa 'intjaam' kiya tha
 The party has fielded Pitroda in Gujarat for two reasons
 ve gujarati hai or shahari yuva votaron main unki iken sareekhee apil he
 This is the area where the BJP has traditionally performed better than the Congress
 unhone apni skool kii padhai soobe ke vallabh vidyanagar se kii or phir vadodara ke ejineering college main gaye
 Pitroda is currently visiting five cities — Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Surat, and trying to find out what urban Gujaratis expect from the Congress
 yojana ke mutabik chote kaarobaariyon, kamgaaron or auraton se baatcheet kii ja rahi he or sambhaavna he ki unase mili salaah ko chunaav ghoshnaptr main shaamil kiya jayega
 Pitroda has been put in charge of the team that will prepare the 'manifesto Manifesto' with emphasis on education, health, small and medium entrepreneurs, job creation and environmental protection
 baat main asar paidaa karne ke liye pitroda gandhi ke naam kii duhai bhi dene lage hai
 It is not going to waste either
 unhone gujarat sarkaar par hamalaa kiya ki usne vah skool band kar diya jisamen mahatma gandhi gaye the
 Without referring to Modi's Gujarat model, Pitroda is taking a front from the Prime Minister on his most effective electoral slogan, ie development
 ve 'badi pariyojnaon se hankey jate america model' ke haq main nahin hai
 She is supportive of Gandhian emphasis on rural development, farmers and small projects
 party soch-samajhakar 35 saal se kam umr ke yuvaaon par nishaanaa saadh rahi he or uske do andruni survey main kaha gaya he ki rajya sarkaar se chaatro kii naaraazgi kii ek vajah shiksha kii oonchi laagat he
 Pitroda also raises a voice in this case, "handing education in private hands is a big issue in Gujarat
 chaatro ko moti fees chukaane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya he
 "the only lapse (if any) so far is that the role of social media as a tool of publicity has been unfriendly
 vah bhi tab jab rahul ko nai kchayaati isi kii badaulat hasil hui he
 In another gesture towards Modi, he says, "some leaders have to rely on tools like Facebook and Twitter to communicate with people

 dekhen film'hero'kaa gaanaa 'yaadan teriyaan': About 10 days after the Intermediate Toppers scam surfaced in Bihar, another shocking revelation has been revealed
 ab tak to farji toppers ke naam or number kaa khulaasa hua tha, lekin isane bihar board or maamle ke kingpin amit singh urf baccha raay kii mileebhagat kii pole kholkar rakh di he
 According to the government's FIR, Inter's first topper is not Saurabh Shrestha but Shalini Rai, who is the daughter of Bacha Rai
 board ke toppers list main shalini kaa naam nahiboard ne jabatoppers kii listjari kii to usamen shalini kaa naam hi nahin tha
 In the third page of the FIR registered by the Education Department in Kotwali, Patna, the name of Shalini is clearly written instead of the name of the first topper
 duusare topper ke taur par saurabh shreshth kaa naam he or chauthe topper ke taur par rahul kaa naam he
 Why did the board not name Shalini in the toppers list? Actually, the daughter of Varshun Rai College's surveyor Amit Singh alias Bachha Rai, who was already on the radar, also topped the inter, but her name would have created an uproar
 isliye uske naam ko chupa diya gaya
 The toppers list started with another name i
e
 Saurabh Shrestha
 'aaj tak' ke khulaase ke baad jab adhikariyon ne jaanch shuru kii to paaya ki shalini ko na sirf sabase zyada number mili hai balki wo science topper bhi he
 As soon as the daughter's name became a commotion, her name was suppressed
 exiaar kii shuruyaat main hi shalini kaa naminter rigelt se hui fajihat ko dekhte hue sarkaar nen exiaar kii shuruyaat shalini ke naam se hi kii he
 In this FIR, it is clearly written about Shalini Rai that she was a topper in science and her copy has been completely manipulated
 uski copy ke number ko fadkar duusari jagah number likhaa gaya he
 Arbitrary in releasing the toppers list, in fact, not only is there a scam in making the topper but it has also been arbitrary in releasing the toppers list
 shalini raay jo ki 2014 main metric main puure bihar kii topper thi usne inter main bhi top kiya he, lekin is dar se ki kahi hangaamaa na ho jaae or puraa bhed khul jaae
 This time, the toppers list was released by intercepting his result in Inter
 khulaase ke baad badal gai toppers listis khulaase ke baad ab farji toppers list bhi badal di gai he
 That is, Shalini's name now tops the list of fake toppers
 saurabh shreshth science kaa doosraa farji topper he
 Rahul Kumar has dropped from third to number four
 website ke mutabik shalini ne nahin di parikshachaunkaane vaali baat ye he kiefaiaramen to shalini raay ko pratham topper bataaya gaya he, lekin jab website par uske rol number or rol code ko daalaa jaataa he to vahaan dikhataa he ki usne pariksha hi nahin di
 The question is that according to the result, if he did not appear for the examination, how and where did his result come from, how was he declared as the topper of Bihar and how did his copy come out? The inking had taken place
 is farjivade ko chupaane ke liye board ne aanan-fanan main apni jaanch samiti bana di thi
 Later it was also dissolved
 sarkaar ke haath jab shalini raay kii copy lagi to nitish kumaar ne ye faisla kiya ki ab kisi jaanch kii bajaae sidhecriminal cese darjkar sajeesh kii tahakikat kii jaaegi

 In the country's capital Delhi, an incident was going to happen in front of people's eyes on Sunday
 lekin ho na saki
 Because that incident was saved by the watchful eyes which Delhi is proud of
 dopaher ke kareeb 2 baje sarita vihaar metro stesan ke footover brij ke duusare sire kii sidhiyon par ek ladki or ek ladkaa pahunche
 The girl was wearing a beige colored top and black jeans
 jabaki kaali shart or safed rang kaa pant pahane ladkaa uske thik peeche kuch faasale par tha
 The girl reaches the bridge and stands by the railing in the nearest corner of the stairs
 jabaki uske thik peeche aane vaala ladkaa vahaan rukta nahin he balki aage nikal jaataa he
 There is definitely less movement of people on the bridge
 lekin rah rah kar ikkaa dukka log aate jate hai
 But those most oblivious girls stand there and look down from the bridge
 ladki ke kareeb se guzarane waalon main se ek shaks jarur ladki kii taraf ghumkar dekhtaa he
 Because in the afternoon why a girl is standing on the bridge like this in the sun and he goes on his way without saying anything
 logon kii awajahi ke bich thodi der baad metro stesan kii taraf se vahi kaali shart vaala ladkaa phir nazar aata he
 He walks slowly and stops by going straight to the girl
 logon kii awajahi se bekhbar donon aapas main baat karne lagate hai
 After talking for a while, the boy goes down the same stairs
 jin sidhiyon se wo ladki ke peeche peeche chalata hua brij par aayaa tha
 Even after the boy leaves, the girl stands there and stares down from the bridge for a long time
 thodi der baad achaanak ladki harakat karti dikhaai detii he
 She rests her both feet on the railing
 jis vakt ladki railing par pair rakhkar khadi hoti he uske thik peeche se guzar rahaa ek or noujvaan saamne kii railing par tikkar khadaa ho jaataa he
 The girl silently sees a passerby climbing the stairs and stands silently
 us rahgeer ke kareeb se guzar jane ke baad jaise hi duusari taraf railing se tikkar khadaa ladkaa apni jagah se hatakar sidhiyon kii taraf badhata he
 Then the girl's actions startle everyone
 wo railing ke upar pair chadhaakar railing ko paar karne kii koshish karti dikhaai detii he
 While the girl was trying to cross the railing, three people were passing through the bridge
 do ladkiyaan or ek noujvaan, jabaki sidhiyon ke najadik khadaa ladkaa neeche kii taraf dekh rahaa tha
 On seeing this, the girl is seen trying to pull the railing and starts hanging from the railing in one stroke
 ab ladki kii peeth sadak kii taraf or cheharaa brij kii taraf ho jaataa he
 Seeing the girl in this condition, one of the two girls passing by the bridge walks close to her and is seen talking to her
 ek ladki pul se kudane kii koshish karti dikhaai de rahi he jabaki do ladkiyaan usase baat kar rahi hai
 This manger draws people coming to the bridge and many people suddenly gather there one by one
 magar koi bhi us railing se lataki hui ladki ke kareeb jane kii himmat nahin karata
 Just then, a uniformed man appears to be moving towards the metro station and behind that jawan, another uniformed man moves towards the same side
 siaisef ke jawan jawan teji se bheed ke bich se guzarakar us ladki ke kareeb pahunchataa he or ek hi jatke main railing se lataki hui ladki kaa haath pakad letaa he
 As soon as he holds his hand, the young man picks up any item of the girl who has fallen on the bridge close to that girl, and the other young man coming behind the young man also comes close to him to support his partner
 do vardiwaalon ko ek ladki ko railing se latakane kii haalat se bachaane kii koshish karata dekh brij par acha khaasaa majamaa lag jaataa he
 The young man in uniform pulls the girl hanging from the railing and brings it over the bridge, when a female soldier also appears to be moving in the same direction
 wo mahila sipaahi apane saathiyon ke kareeb pahunchakar ladki kaa haath pakadati he or use metro stesan kii taraf lekar chalane lagati he
 Now you might want to know who this girl is? Why did she want to die by jumping from the bridge
 wo ladkaa koun tha jo use marane ke liye chhod kar chalaa gaya? or sabase bada sawaal ye ki aakhir siaisef ke javaanon ko kaise pataa chalaa ki ladki pul se kudane vaali he?wo ladki koun he or kahaan kii rahane vaali he
 We cannot disclose his identity so that he does not get slander
 bas yun samaj lijie
 The girl is a resident of the capital and had arrived here with her boyfriend
 lekin kisi baat par donon main jhagada hua or usee jhagade ke baad uskaa bvoy friend vahaan se chalaa gaya
 Perhaps she too had no idea that the girl could even try to jump from the bridge
 wo shaayad isi gumaan main use akelaa chhodkar vahaan se chalaa gaya ki uski tarah wo ladki bhi kuch der baad vahaan se chali jaaegi
 But how did the CISF personnel know that the girl standing on the bridge was about to jump
 dilli ke duusare tamaam metro stesan kii tarah sarita vihaar metro stesan kii hifaazat kaa jimmaa siaisef ke jawan karte hai
 CCTV cameras have also been installed to keep a close watch on the station, to prevent any accidents or incidents around the metro station
 or vahiin stesan main banaae gaye control rum main baqayada sisitivi camaron kii tasveeron kii monitering bhi siaisef ke jawan karte rahete hai
 During the monitoring of CCTV camera pictures, the CISF jawans got suspicious when they saw the girl standing alone for a long time on the footover bridge
 lihaaja un logon ne uski harek harakat par nazar gada di
 And as soon as he felt that the girl could jump from the bridge
 to ain vakt par siaisef kaa jawan maukey par ja pahunchaa or vakt rahete ek jindagi ke saath saath ek haadasa hone se bachaa liya
 What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood

 telugana vidhansabha chunaav main congress or telugudesham party (tidipi) milakar chunavi maidan main utari thi, lekin ye prayog safal nahin ho sakaa tha
 This is the reason why Congress and TDP have decided to contest separately in the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 iske peeche donon partiyon kii sochi samajhi ranneeti he
 Both the Congress and the TDP seem to have a political advantage
 haalanki mana ja rahaa he ki chunaav ke baad donon partiyaan ek saath aa jaaengi
 Andhra Pradesh Congress President Raghuveera Reddy said that in the upcoming elections, the Congress will contest elections with no alliance with any party in the state
 congress andhra pradesh kii 175 vidhansabha siton or 25 loksabhaa siton par aagaamee chunaav main apane dam par ladegi or tidipi ke saath gathbandhan nahin kiya jayega
 TDP decided not to ally with the political situation
 andhra pradesh main reddy or kamma do samudaay siyaasi taur par kaaphi mahatvapurn maani jaati he
 Andhra Pradesh, says that both communities are politically opposed to each other
 congress kaa mulvot bank reddy hai to tidipi kaa aadhaar kamma samudaay ke bich he

 Apart from this, the anti-incumbency vote against the TDP government is also a danger of going with Jagan instead of Congress
 isi baat ko samajhate hue donon ne gathbandhan kar chunaav nahin ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 While there will be a friendly fight between the two parties
 bataa den ki congress ke reddy samudaay ke najadik hone ke chalate hi anti ramarao ne tidipi kaa gathan kiya tha
 NTR came from the Kamma community and Chandrababu Naidu also belongs to this community
 suresh bataate hai ki reddy samudaay ke vot par bijepi kii najar he, kyonki ye samudaay kaaphi hindootvvaadi maani jaati he
 Whereas Reddy communities are soft
 bataa den ki telugana ke congress netaaon ne rahul gandhi se tidipi se gathbandhan todane kii maang kii thi
 He did not want the two parties to contest elections together
 telugana vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko tidipi ke saath gathbandhan karne kaa isiilie nuksaan uthaanaa padaa, uski 21 se ghatakar 19 siten rah gai hai

 ye naam jab bhi hamaare jehan ke sunahare parde par ubhar kar aata he, vaise hi hamaare honton par ek besakhta muskaan aa hi jaati he

 Whether we are doing any job today, living in any corner of the country and abroad, playing with thousands, millions, crores, but there are some things in college days that are not forgotten or say that we Never want to forget those things

 college kii vah pehali classuf
 
 
 What a day it was too
 nae nae chehron ke bich us din jindagi badi akeli lag rahi thi
 But it was not known that in the coming days, all these faces will become an important part of our life
 pehali class atend karne se zyada ladakon kaa focus is baat par tha ki class main ladkiyaan kitni hai, reshio ke hisaab se
 Although on the first day it did not even dare to do more research
 college kaa wo pehla krashkolege kaa pehla krash jise dekhne ke baad pehali baar filmon kii tarah peeche se vylan kii aawaaj sunai di thi hamen
 Everything was happening like the romantic film of Yash Raj Films
 uski safed salwar suut or laal dupatta aaj bhi kai baar yaadon ke jhonke ke saath hamaare dil ko chhu jaataa he
 (note: The use of the word 'first' here is because there was a lot of crush but every time the heart crushed
 )college kaa vah pehla prapojal or datobus bas
 
 
 a lot of film talk happened
 ab vakt tha ection kaa
 Looked at him, Vayalan also sounded, fell in love but now it was the turn to launch 'mission Pehla Pyaar'
 lekin uske pehle ye pataa karnaa tha ki ladki single he yaa kamited
 After extensive research, our friends said that 'bhabhi' is still single
 bas phir kya tha
 
 
 Reaching the heart, we reached in front of him and put the proposal to be one forever
 prapojal except hone ke baad dil confidence se bhar gaya or yaad aane lagi bujurg premiyon kii wo baat ki 'badi shiddat se tuje paane kii chahat kii he

 It was the most painful at that time
 lekin kya karen pyaar andhaa jo hota he
 It was the most heartbreaking moment of the first heartbreak college days
 us pehle krash ne dil ko itani buree tarah 'krash' kiya ki uske tukdon ko ikattha karne main kai din lag gaye
 It turned out, our friends 'sister-in-law' has held up the hand of a senior
 doston kaa gussa bhi ubaal par tha
 Our friends did not even eat that day
 ye wo lamhaa tha jab dost or kareeb aae
 Thinking of 'aishwarya will come in the heart of the heart the next day', we all decided to move forward
 college kii wo canteendoston kii toli canteen main jab gaanaa gaati thi vah bhi teble baja kar to lagata tha hamase bada koi rockstar paidaa hi nahin hua
 It was necessary to do this to digest the mess after eating the cooked food

 Where an attempt was made to generate one idea
 saare think tanks ek jagah ikattha hokar har tarah ke masale ko sulajhane kii koshish karte the
 That college college place where we used to wake up at night and sleep till 10 in the morning
 pehali class to kai baar chhuti hogi
 Gather in a room and dance to the tune of a guitar, muttering
 vahaan guzari har raat aaj bhi jehan main maujuud he
 One of the beautiful college college professors who would have seen this feeling, i wish i would have been born a few years ago
 us khubasurat faikalti kii class kisi bhi haalat main nahin chhootati thi
 Even if the assignment of any subject is not ready, but they used to complete their assignment
 unhen naaraaz hone kaa koi mauka nahin dete the
 The smile of that beautiful faculty is not forgotten even today
 ek anokhi jagah: libraricolege ke dinon main is anokhe jagah se sabase kam vaasta rahaa he
 Therefore, there will not be much talk about it
 is jagah kaa sabase zyada istemaal ladkiyaan karti thim
 Yes, this place was considered the safest after class bunk
 xerox mashinakolege ke dinon main sabase zyada paise isi par kharch hue hai
 Hey Baba, in getting the notes xeroxed
 ladakiyon ke librari jane kaa sabase bada phayda ye tha ki wo har subject kaa point tu point nots bana leti thim or ladke uskaa xerox kara kar apana keemtee samay bachaa lete the
 Whether it was a cheap wallet or a price kept inside it, in both cases our wallets were cheap in those days
 kabhi 20, kabhi 2000, paison kaa utaar chadhaav laga rahata tha share bazaar kii tarah
 But the courage was so high that they would not allow any friend to feel short of money
 jab hamen jarurat padi dost saath the or jab unhen, tab ham
 Birthday party of friends, saab 
 The actual celebration was on this day
 bhale aaj janmdin par bam par laat maarane waalon kii sankhya kam ho gai ho lekin un dinon janmdin par itane laat padate the ki do din tak baithna mushkil ho jaataa tha
 Bring cake by hiding it from friends and then at 12 o'clock at night, only our voice echoed in the entire locality
 kuch aisa hota tha hamaare janmdin kaa aagaaj
 The budget of two months to feed friends was shaken but the fucking friends did not give even a gift
 ek pakaau dostahar kisi ke doston ke fehrist main ek pakaau kism kaa dost jarur hota he
 Whoever cooks after speaking English after drinking liquor, sometimes weeps when he is broken, and sometimes makes excuses for not having any money
 lekin lakh kamiyon ke baavjood wo ham sabakaa bahut pyaara bhi hota he
 On that last day of college, that day also came in the memory of which the eyes are moist even today
 us din saare gile-shikave kinare rakh kar ek baar gale lagane kaa sukh bhulaae nahin bhuulataa
 Will keep the contact with the promise that they will meet once a year
 vaise vaade to kaiyon ne kiye the lekin itane saal baad bahut kam log hi use nibhaa paae hai
 That day everyone was saying that i wish we could stay in this college forever, just together
 chaliye ji
 
 
 You have missed your college days very much
 ab is panne ko Minimize kiijie or lag jaaie apane kaam par varna peeche se bos aa jaaenge
 Really, how beautiful that moment was where even the smallest things used to give us a strange pleasure and today we avoid saying the same things as our childishness

 Once upon a time there used to be a Bombay
 parikthaon kaa shahar
 It was the land where the confluence of myth and reality, poetry and imagination, hope and wisdom took place
 yah hamaara sabase awwal shahar tha
 It was the economic heart of the country and the life of civilization
 baaki mulk ke liye yah chamakili panniyon se madha kalpana kaa sansar tha, jahaan kuch bhi mumkin tha
 For the residents here, this was the peak of the dreams being taken away from the business, where the next jump would change the destiny as soon as the bus turned back
 dilli sharnaarthiyon kii basti thi, jiskaa tanabana mughalon ke patan ke baad karstani se buna gaya tha
 Kolkata, the country's first remote urban settlement, was devastated by the disastrous situation of the rule and the rise of Naxalism
 lekin bombai videshi prabhaavon kaa pehla padaav or thikaana bani rahi, ek kism kaa awwal sadar darwaja, jo kaarobaari rajdhani or vividh samskritiyon kaa sangam tha
 For the locals here, Bombay or Mumbai was always a city of settlers from outside
 'agar aap ise banaaenge, to ve aaenge' or bombai main ve chaaron dishaao se daude chale aae
 But they were different from the settlers from outside in other places of India
 jo yahaan kii sarajameen par utre, unhone yahaan ke taur-tareeke apanaae
 Instead of replacing Bombay, he let Bombay replace him
 bombai ne aise najaare, shor or tajurbe pesh kiye, jo kisi bhi duusare hindustani shahar main maujuud nahin the
 People used to stand at bus stand and outside the elevators
 ve niyam-kaayade se len main gadibhan chalaate, kabhi horn nahin bajaate
 His headlights were always on low beam
 taxi driveron or autochaalkon ne kabhi sawari lene se inkaar nahin kiya
 Most of them settled in this last sanctuary of India in search of shelter
 aglaa mode ho yaa doordaraj kaa upnagar, is baat se fark nahin padataa ki aapako kahaan janaa he
 He always gave the first answer with the beautiful and obedient 'khaching' of the meter
 isamen nijee kuch nahin tha, balki aazaadee dilaane vaala tha
 Candid, but welcoming with both arms spread
 vividhta se bharaa, magar sahansheel
 The culture of hard work was so deeply rooted in its existence that even communalism could not bypass it
 yahaan aapako kuch hona nahin padataa tha, aap kuch ban sakate the
 Bombay was a throbbing, thriving global metropolis
 bombai ek ajeeb sangam tha jisane apni bhashaa gadhi, apane saanskrithik samudaayon kii rachana kii
 Whatever the amount in class, caste, gender or bank account, everyone used to stay in the city instead of being lost in his secluded avatar at all times
 gregory david robatrs ne shantaram main likhaa tha, bombai main hindustan kii duusari jagah se zyada sapane dekhe jaaenge, tootenge or sach honge
 It was a land of heroes and villains, characters and dialogues, music and songs, verses and melodies
 bombai main rahane kaa matlab tha iskaa jashn manaanaa, ise jaananaa, isse mohabbat karnaa
 But Bombay, or now even Mumbai for the outsiders, is undergoing a change
 aisa shahar jisamen jagah kaa tota pad gaya he, jo apane jodon se darak rahaa he, or jo lambey samay se akaash kii ore failata gaya he
 It has pushed a large number of its old and new residents to the margins
 nijee or saarvajinak jagahon kii is punarkalpana ke natijatan suvidha or najdiki kii hode chhid gai he, jisamen samudaay dhire-dhire ek duusare ke khilaaf lamaband hote gaye hai
 The rise of communal politics, the resurgence of Marathi pride and the mobilization against Muslims and Bahirajas at the hands of parties like Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena that emerged from it is one of the dangerous births of this geographical shift
 isane rachanaatmak hode kii jagah duusare ko chota sabit karne ke jhagadon ko janm diya he or sthaneey bashindon ko bahiraagton ke, hinduon ko musalamaanon ke or amiron ko madhyam vargeeyon ke mukaable khadaa kar diya he
 This is evident from several incidents
 masalan, sudhindra kulkarni ke chehre par kaalikh potne vaala hamalaa, pakistan ke saath cricket khilne ko lekar bisisiai ke daftar main hangaamaa
 Due to being pushed out of the city, it has also become difficult for people to socialize with Bombay the way they used to be earlier
 bason or local trainon main chalanaa jaruri he, lekin ab yah utana shkulya nahin rah gaya he
 They now seem to be old-fashioned and disliked
 asal main kamyaabi kaa ek sidhaa-sada paimaana is haisiyat main hona he ki aapako ab inamen safar na karnaa pade
 As a result of shrinking of open spaces, people 's interaction with the city has further reduced
 samandar ke kinare vishaal khule marine drive par aap ab bhi udyogpatiyon, buddhijiviyon, adaakaaron or khiladinnon ko shaam ko tahaltey hue or gumnaam taur par bheed ke bich ghulte-milte hue dekhte hai
 But such scenes are also no longer common
 kuch myanon main bombai ko uske apane bashindon ne hi chalaa he
 During the last decade, the status of everything in general has dropped
 buniyadi dhaanche kaa, khuli jagahon kaa, samudaayon ke bich meljol or baatcheet kaa, udhyamshiltaa kaa, aane-jane ke sadhano kaa, swasthya sevaaon kaa, raat kii ranginiyon kaa, kya khaaen tathaa kahaan rahen sareekhee buniyadi aazaadiyon kaa
 This fall has been accepted by the people
 shahar kii jo jeevanstyli or mulya hua karte the, unamem giravat ai he
 There is no doubt that there is a tone of rebellion in the Fijas of Bombay
 bijepi ke netritvvali sarkaar ne saat maheene pehle rajya main gomance par aam pabandi laga di thi, lekin bhens kaa maance shahar bhar main gupachup tareeke se bik rahaa he
 The ban on dance bars has been lifted by the Supreme Court on October 15, but during these 10 years of the ban, they used to walk in hidden corners of the city
 yah bhi badakismat tabdili he, kyonki bombai hindustan kaa aisa shahar tha, jahaan aapako choti-choti aazaadiyon ke liye baghawat nahin kerani padati thiah jahaan aap jo bhi karte the, khullamakhulla karte the, dab-chhipakar nahin
 Perhaps the biggest hurdle in Bombay is that the rest of India has progressed well and risen
 pehle jo log baahar se yahaan aate the, ve aisi jagahon se aate the jo aarthik or saamaajik taur par banisbatan pichhadi hui thim
 There neither did they see the sight and pomp, nor that world of opportunities
 aaj bharat bhar ke shahar aage ja rahe hai
 Multiplexes, malls, pubs, tall buildings with glass walls, new businesses and a variety of jobs are now everywhere
 mumbai apane ko aage dhakelne main naakaam rahi he or isliye ab vah apane ko utana khaas mahasoos nahin karti
 The desire to follow the principles of his principles is fast disappearing
 mumbai kaa dimag jaise-jaise band ho rahaa he, vaise-vaise hindustan kaa dimag is had tak khul rahaa he ki donon ek duusare ke baraabar hone kii taraf bad rahe hai
 Bombay is slowly moving away from diversity to the universal urban population, whose prejudice, intolerance and restlessness are where the rest of India is troubled
 duniyabar ke khaas mahanagaron ke bare main jahaan kai daleelein di jaati rahi hai, vahiin german samajashastri jorg cimail ne ek aankh kholane vaali baat kahi he ki aakhir vah kya cheez he jo mahanagaron ko mahaan banaati he? unhone likhaa he, ''mahanagar khud ko un mahaan aitihaasik bunaavaton main se ek ke taur par udghaatit karte hai, jinamein jindagi ko ek jagah ikattha karne vaali paraspar virdohi dharaaen khulti or saath hi baraabar haq se ek duusare ke saath judati hai
 “in India, one such cooperative city, Tharu, is indifferent and intimate at the same time
 anuraag kashyap kii 2015 kii film bombai velvet kaa ek dialog bakhubi bayaan karata he ki bombai ke kya maani heru ''bombai ke baahar pataa he kya he? india!'' agle kuch pannon main alag-alag kshetron kii khaas hastiyah jinamein se harek kaa bombai se gaharaa judaav haih aaj kii bombai kii padtaal karengi, bataaengi ki yah kidar ja rahi he, isane kya ganvaa diya he or kaise vah use waapas paa sakati he
 Because there used to be a Bombay
 waisi hi duusari bombai kab hogi? The by-election process for 58 new members and one seat for Rajya Sabha is going on in 16 states of the country
 in 58 siton main 25 siton ke liye chunaav 6 rajyon main karaae ja rahe hai jabaki 10 rajyon se 33 sadsy bina kisi virodh ke rajya sabha pahunch rahe hai
 But what will change the politics of the country with the final results of the Rajya Sabha elections, will BJP dominate the Rajya Sabha like Lok Sabha? If not, how will the current state of the Rajya Sabha affect the Lok Sabha elections to be held in 2019? 'after these elections in the Rajya Sabha, the BJP can gain up to 15 seats in the changed arithmetic of the House
 is phaayde se bijepi maujuuda 58 sadasyon ke aankade ko badhaakar 72-73 tak pahunchaa degi
 However, this figure is far below the 123 seats required for majority in Rajya Sabha
 gauratlab he ki maujuuda chunaavon ke baad congress ko lagbhag 8 se 10 siton kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa or rajya sabha main uskaa aankada 54 se ghatakar lagbhag 45 tak pahunch jayega
 Therefore, one thing is clear in this situation that BJP will not get majority in Rajya Sabha during the tenure of the current Lok Sabha
 iske liye use ek baar phir 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main prachand bahumat main aane ke saath-saath 2018 or 2019 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main badhat banani hogi
 In such a situation, it will not be easy for the BJP to catch up with its Hindu agenda before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 nateeja, agle aam chunaavon main ek baar phir use sirf vaadon ke saath prachaar karnaa hoga
 Read this: bjp's 'conscience-style', manipulative politics in every election: The BJP promised to raise the agenda of development as well as its Hindutva agenda in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 chunaav nateezon ke baad jab kendra main majboot modi sarkaar kaa gathan hua to party ne achche din laane ke liye tej vikaas kii nitiyon ko aage badhaayaa
 Now, with just one year left in the 2019 general election, fast growth is missing from the economic data and the bjp's good days are raising the same questions that were faced by Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Shining India
 aisi sthiti main bijepi ke paas waapas hindutv ke agenda par jane kaa vikalp tha lekin rajya sabha main abhi tak bahumat na milane ke chalate agle ek saal tak modi sarkaar ko apane hindutv agenda par jane kaa bhi mauka nahin mil paaegaa
 Significantly, BJP has talked about Hindutva agenda for many decades
 is agenda ke liye beete 4 saal ke dauraan modi sarkaar ne uniform civil code, dhara 370 ko hataane or loksabhaa ke saath-saath deshbhar main vidhansabha chunaavon ko karaane masauda taiyaar kiya he
 But to move ahead on all these drafts, the constitution needs to be amended for which it is necessary that the BJP gets a special majority in the Lok Sabha as well as the Rajya Sabha
 hindutv agenda par khara utarane ke liye yah bhi jaruri he ki bijepi kii kam se kam 15 rajyon main bhi vishesh bahumat vaali sarkaar maujuud rahe
 However, BJP currently has a coalition government in 15 states along with the Chief Minister as well as in 21 states
 lekin rajya sabha main bahumat kii sambhaavna 2019 ke chunaavon ke baad banane kii sthiti main is aankade main bhi pherbadal dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 It is worth noting that while assembly elections in Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand and Maharashtra will be held soon after the 2019 general elections, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, Sikkim and Telangana will be held along with the Lok Sabha elections
 iske alaava 2019 loksabhaa chunaavon se thik pehle 2018 main chhattigarh, karnataka, madhyapradesh, mizoram or rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav karaayenge
 After these elections, if the BJP has a two-thirds majority in 15 states along with a special majority in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at the Center, then an effective decision can be taken on the Hindutva agenda for the Modi government
 camere kii nigaah se kabhi raftaar kaa qahar dekhie
 Believe me then you will never fall in love in life
 dilli se mahaz 28 kilometre kii duuri par ek aisa exprasave he
 Where there are so many colors of speed
 magar un rangon ne naa maaloom kitni hi jindagiyon ko badrang kar diya
 So far, more than a thousand people have been killed by speeding
 jinamein ghayalon kii taadaad alag he
 People should take a lesson from these accidents and be careful on the expressway
 dilli ke kareeb hua tajamahalgrator noida express ve dekhne main acha lagata he
 That means a magnificent eight lane road just 28 kilometers from Delhi
 wo sadak jisane dilli se agra kii duuri kam kar di
 The road that brought the Taj Mahal closer to Delhi
 wo sadak jo ab sidhe lakhanu ko tach karne lagi he
 And if we say that this road is also hitting the trains running on this route, then it is not wrong
 express ve kii khaufnak tasviren bhimgar isi shandaarexpress veki ek duusari or khaufnak tasviir bhi he
 The picture wreaked havoc
 tasviir aath len par gadiyon ko formula van bana dene kii or tasviir raftaar ke romaanch par savaar hokar zindagi ko maut bana dene kii
 Suddenly, somersaults start eating on the unrestrained car expressway
 kahin laharaati esayuvi achaanak palat kar road ke duusari taraf chali jaati he
 Somewhere, the car running on the straight road is also straight on the compulsory turn and goes on the divider
 kahin bhayanak accident ke baad gaadiyaan dhu-dhu kar jal rahi hai or kahin
 Due to unrestrained speed, the children of the overturned car fly away
 haadason kii tasviren sisitivi main kaidasdak par sarapat daudti gadiyon ke bich in haadason kii tasviren haragij hamaare or aapke saamne naa hotin agar eksprave par lagi sisitivi camaron ne inhen kaid naa kiya hota
 What do people know by looking at those pictures? or ainda jab bhi eksprave se gujaren to apane jehan main ise yaad rakhen
 Remember that because of the dangerous speed, the next picture may not be of his car
 geeli sadak par phisalati karsadak par raftaar se nikali maut kii pehali tasviir
 It has just rained at this place
 puri sadak pani se bhari he or gaadiyaan pani ke chhinte udaati hui guzar rahi hai
 Meanwhile, due to high speed and wet road, a car suddenly starts sliding on the road
 lekin chunki raftaar behad tej he driver chaah kar bhi apni gaadi ko qaabu nahin kar paata or beqaabu, belgaum car sadak par hi kalabaziyaan khaane lagati hai
 People die in the mouth of death
 har kalabazi ke saath maut kaa shikanja car main baithe logon par or kasata jaataa he
 The condition is that the car breaks up the divider and goes up and then after some time a person stumbles out of the car and sits there in disgrace
 jabaki khabaron ke mutabik car main savaar kuch or vahiin, usee pal maut ke munh main samaa jate hai
 Another picture of the tragic death of the people in the uncontrollable SUV is a testimony to the speed of the death
 sadak par ek esayuvi betahasha bhaag rahi he or thik pehali tasviir kii tarah yahaan bhi ye esayuvi achaakan beqaabu ho jaati he
 Acrobatics start eating dangerously on the road itself
 or jab tak ye silsilaa thamata he, ye esayuvi bhi chaar pahiyon ke taabut main tabdeel ho jaati he
 In this accident, all the people aboard the car die a painful death
 ud jate hai car ke parakhchhigali tasviir to or bhi chaunkaanewaali he
 You must have heard stories of sleep while driving a car, but have you ever seen anyone falling asleep while driving a car? If not, look in these pictures
 lambii or sidhi express ve par ye car puri raftaar se bhaag rahi he
 Since the road is straight, the driver has no work except to hold the accelerator
 lekin sidhi sadak hi maanon achaanak is car main baithe tamaam logon ko maut ke paas le jaati he
 The car coming from a distance does not turn even when the road turns
 yani complsri turn par bhi car sidhi chalati jaati he or nateeja ye hota he car sadak se utar kar divader se ja takaraati he or dekhte hi dekhte car ke parakhche ud jate hai
 Many cars start burning after the accident, pictures of the accident are going to dry the throat
 ek saath kai gadiyon kii takkar ke baad ek car aag ke gole main badal chuki he or dhu-dhu kar jal rahi he
 People present nearby are flirting
 aag bujhane or car main fanse logon ko baahar nikaalane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But here on the middle road neither people have any arrangement to control such a big fire nor there is any way of rescue
 aise main unke paas sivaay fire brigade ke pahunchane tak intazaar karne ke sivaay or koi chaara nahin bachataa
 But by the time the fire engine reaches here, it is late
 maut ke is express par ye sidan bhi raftaar kaa shikaar ban jaati he
 Suddenly it turns uncontrollable and becomes death

 Film Name: Banjodirector: Ravi Jadhav Star Cast: Ritesh Deshmukh, Nargis Fakri, Dharmesh Yelande Duration: 2 hours 17 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 2
 5 stardiarector ravi jadhav ne 'natarang', 'balak paalak' jaisi ek se badhkar superhit marathi filmein banaai hai or pehali baar ravi ne ek hindi film main haath aajamaaya he
 Will Ravi's entry into Bollywood be awesome? Let's find out in the film review
 
 
 kahanefilm kii kahani mumbai ke rahane walebanjo player nand kishor urf taraat(ritesh deshmukh) kii he jo vahaan ke local mantri ke liye kaam bhi karata he, saath hi apane teen doston paper, greece or waja ke saath functions main parform bhi karata he
 Then Chris (nargis Fakri) comes to Mumbai from New York with the aim of recording 2 songs with the local banjo players, which he can send to a music competition in New York
 kris ke mumbai aane par kahani main bahut saare twist or terns aate hai or aakhirkaar ek rigelt saamne aata he, jise jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 An attempt has been made to keep the script of Scriptfilm very close to real life
 kapil saavant or nikhil mehrotra ke saath khud diarector ravi jadhav ne bhi lekhan main yogadan diya he
 In the story, you see all three emotional, comedy and romantic juices, but none of the juices are fulfilled
 kuch na kuch adhuraa sa dikhaai padataa he
 Although the second half of the film is quite good, but only certain types of audiences will like it
 abhinayafilm main ritesh deshmukh ne kirdaar ko bakhubi nibhaayaa he, or unke exprations se aap khud ko conect kar pate hai
 Nargis Fakri's work is also good
 saath hi film ke baaki sah kalakaaron ne umdaa abhinay kiya he
 Weak episode The weak link of the film is its story which is quite slow in the first half, as well as some songs that make the pace of the story weak
 star vailu kii vajah se bhi kamai par asar pad saktaa he
 The music of sangeethaisal-shekhar duo Nephilm is good and has tried its best to connect each song to the film
 lekin kuch gane film kii raftaar ko kaaphi kamjor kar dete hai
 Why see Ritesh Deshmukh and Vishal Shekhar are fans of music, so they can watch the film once

 Elephants used to attack this farmer's fields every day
 haathiyon kaa jhund khet-khalihaanon main lagi lahalhati fasalon ko chat kar jaataa tha
 Due to the continuous attack of elephants, the bank loan to the victim farmer had reached two and a half lakh

 hollywood ke baad hindi antertenment industry main # metoo campan ke tahat kai logon ne apni aapbeetee sunai he
 After coming in front of Tanushridatta, other victims have also started keeping hidden pain in front of the world for years
 # metoo movement kii gaaj ab tak naanaa patekar, vikaas bahal, alok nath, chetan bhagat, rajat kapur, utsav chakravarti or tanmay bhatta jaise celebs par giri he
 Survivors are getting support from people and celebrities
 is movement ke jor pakadaney ke baad logon or sansthaaon ke approach main badlaav bhi dikh rahe hai
 The biggest evidence of which is CINTAA
 tanushri ke maamle main CINTAA ke rukh se ise samajha ja saktaa he
 Sintaaj is having an important meeting in Mumbai
 aropiyon ke khilaaf kadaa faisla aane kii sambhaavna he
 My friend's husband raped her by giving drugs in alcohol, the producer's objection is seeing that celebs are refraining from speaking against the Survivors of the # metoo campaign
 isliye is maamle main yaa to celebs aropiyon kii ninda kar rahe hai yaa to chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Digitization has helped women victims of sexual exploitation and molestation
 aaie jaanate hai kaise # metoo ne antertenment industry main maahaul badla he
 Re-investigation into the tanushree-nana controversy, CINTAA was framed and raped by Jabana Patekar in CINTAA2008 when CINTAA went to the case
 tanushri ne sinta ke paas shikaayat darj karai thi
 But strict action was not taken
 ab 10 saal baad jab ye maamla dobaaraa se uchhla he, to sinta ne pehle to is maamle par dukh jataayaa
 CINTAA said, "we are with Tanushree but this case cannot be reopened as they do not take a case more than 3 years old
 "alok nath par bhadke log, celebs ne bhi sanskari babu par nikaala gussahalanki mitu par logon kii mukharata kii vajah se ab CINTAA ke rukh main bhi narmi ai he
 They are willing to re-examine the case
 sinta kaa apni galati maanakar koshish karnaa bade badlaav kii shuruuaat ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Victims Believed # metoo Campaign's sexual abuse and molestation women have gained huge support after catching up
 pehle jahaan mahilaayein apane saath hue is bure krity ko bataane se darati thim
 They feared that the society would condemn them, raising their voice would bring disrepute to them
 alag thalag pad jaaengi, lekin ab soshal media ke jariye ve apni aapbeetee khulkar share kar rahi hai
 The biggest reason for this is also that people are trusting the wounds of the victims
 10 saal baad tanushri maamle par naanaa- 'vakil ne kaha isliye chup hum'alag-thalag pade vikaas bahal # metoo abhiyaan main nirdeshkavikas bahalaka naam saamne aane ke baad ve alag-thalag pad gaye hai
 During the promotional tour of Bombay Velvet, the woman in the film's crew have accused him of molestation
 mahila ne is baat kii shikaayat phantum films ke hi anuraag kashyap se bhi kii thi
 But no action was taken on this entire incident
 maamla badhata dekh phantum films ke anuraag kashyap, vikramaditya motwani ne khed jataayaa
 Said then we could not handle this issue properly
 anuraag, vikramaditya donon ne hi vikaas bahal se kinaaraa kar liya he
 Hrithik has also hampered development
 ruthik ne vikaas kii nirdeshit film super-30 main kaam kar rahe hai
 He wrote that i cannot work with such a person
 kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki super 30 ke nirdeshak ke rup main vikaas bahal kaa naam bhi hataa diya jayega
 Two more projects have been snatched from development
 # metoo abhiyaan se bahut bada badlaav ye aayaa he ki ab aropiyon ko bycott kiya jane laga he
 People like Rajat Kapoor and Chetan Bhagat apologized before the controversy escalated
 tanushri ne police ke baad ab women kamishan main kii naanaa kii shikayatyon peedita ke liye koi samay seemaa nahinkendriya mahila evam bal vikaas mantri menka gandhi kaa kahana he ki yon utpeedan kii shikaayat ghatana ke 10 se 15 saal baad bhi kii ja sakati he
 He expressed his happiness over the # metoo campaign and said that this is just the beginning
 mujhe nahin lagata yah abhiyaan niyantran se baahar chalaa jayega
 The anger that arises inside the victim from this incident never ends with whom it passes, she will never forget it
 yahi kaaran he ki hamane kanoon mantralay ko likhaa he ki yon shoshan kii ghatana ke bare main shikaayat karne kii koi samay seemaa nahin honi chahie

 'poonam Pandey's entry is like this
 is bold bala kii pehali film 'nasha' kaa yah doylog aapako madahosh kar degaa
 Looking at the bold style shown in the trailer, if you are eager to see the film, then you are probably thinking right
 punam pandey jis cheez ke liye femes hai, film main vah use bakhubi anjaam detii najar aa rahi hai
 Boldness, beautiful looks, hot lip lock and entertainment

 Nasha's story is about an 18-year-old obsessed boy who is in love with a 25-year-old girl
 vah bhi ek aisi ladki ke pyaar main jise vah chup-chup kar dekh to saktaa he lekin hasil nahin kar saktaa
 This desire to get a girl becomes an addiction for that boy
 or isi ke ird-gird sari kahani buni gai he
 In the film, the scenes of the boy's sexual fantasy have been filmed a lot and due to this Poonam Pandey has also got a full opportunity to show her body
 aap sani leone yaa sharleen chopra se tulana kiye bina hi is film ko dekhen to punam pandey ko acha lagegaa, kyonki vah khud kahati hai ki wo porn star nahin hai
 By the way, you can guess yourself by watching the film
 film ke sex seens kii khaasiyat yah hai ki punam unamem hero par haaavee hoti najar aa rahi hai
 The film is directed by 'jism' fame Amit Saxena
 soshal cites par apane jalwon or caments kii vajah se punam pandey ke lakhon phans hai
 It will be known within a week that Poonam Pandey is able to leave the impact of her first film 'nasha' on the strength of her murderers and her fans

 Leaders associated with the Karnataka BJP say that the current coalition government in the state is not functioning properly and the alliance is clearly visible

 Senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister of the state b

 People close to Yeddyurappa say that the Karnataka government can fall anytime
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa kahana he ki congress or jedies ke log yah aarope laga rahe hai ki bhaajapa unke vidhayakon ko todna chaahati he jo sahi nahin he
 The correct thing is that the present government of Karnataka itself is unable to keep its mlas united
 aise main jab bhi yah lagegaa ki maujuuda sarkaar ne bahumat kho diya he mukhya vipakshi dal ke naate bhaajapa kaa yah daayitv he ki vah avishvaas prastaav laae
 Sources say that BJP President Amit Shah has made it clear to the state unit that it is not his (BJP) responsibility to save the government

 Input: IANS Election Commission has issued the notice over violation of Model Code of Conduct by Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu; condemning the statements made by him during election campaign held at Barsoi & Barari of Katihar District in Bihar
 https: / / t
 co / tfd5v52hm3siddhu ne katihaar main kaha tha, 'main aapako chetavanee dene aayaa hum muslim bhaiyon, ye baant rahe hai aapako, ye yahaan ovaisi jaise logon ko laa ke, ek nai party khadi kar aap logon kaa vot baant ke jeetna chaahate hai
 If you gather, vote in unison, then Modi will settle
 'bataa den ki isse pehlenirvachan ayog ne navjot singh siddhu ko bihar ke katihaar main ek chunavi raily ke dauraan adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan karne ke liye shanivaar ko ek notice jari kiya tha
 In the notice, the commission has mentioned the use of religion by Sidhu in his appeal to voters on April 15 in support of Congress candidate Tariq Anwar from Katihar
 ayog ne kaha tha ki bihar ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari ne ek video clip bheji he, jisamen siddhu alpsankhyak samudaay ke matadaataaon se kah rahe hai ki ve voton kaa bantwaaraa na hone den
 He also asked them to unite and vote for the Congress so that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could be uprooted from power

 Lalu Prasad Yadav is serving a sentence in jail
 yah pehla mauka he jab kisi chunaav main lalu prasad yadav raily, sabha se dur rahe
 His allies including his party Rashtriya Janata Dal also suffered
 chunavi samar main netritv unke bete tejasvi yadav ke kandhon par tha
 The politics based on the caste-based equation till now forced all parties to field candidates accordingly
 chaahe endie ho yaa upie, kisi ne us formule se kinaaraa nahin kiya
 Yadavs, Bhumihars, Muslims, Kurmi, Paswan all types of candidates were in the fray and among them the people chose the representative of their constituency
 argedy, congress, ham, araspi, viipi jaisi partiyon ke gathbandhan ke ummidavaar bhi jati aadhaarit raajnneeti se hi nikalakar aae the, phir bhi endie ko takkar nahin de paae
 Lalu Prasad's absence, Tejashwi's leadership or Tej Pratap's rebellion, what led to such a defeat? The NDA had announced its candidates
 kaaryakarta prachaar main jute gaye the lekin mahagathbandhan apane ummidavaaron kii suchi jari nahin kar paa rahaa tha or jab suchi jari hui to argedy or congress ke kuch varisht netaa naaraaz ho gaye
 Angry leaders announced that he would remain in the fray
 congress ke varisht netaa shakeel ahamed madhubani se chunaav maidan main nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main utre or tisare number par rahe
 In Darbhanga, the party was not supported by senior leaders like MM Fatmi
 iskaa asar kaaryakartaaon par bhi hua
 a rebellion from the family of Lalu Prasad Yadav's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav played an important role in weakening the Grand Alliance in the election campaign
 jahanabad kii seat argedy jeet sakati thi agar tej pratap yadav ke vidroh ko roak diya jaataa
 RJD continued to have a poor attitude here
 iskaa asar kai duusari loksabhaa siton par bhi hua jinamein shivahar, saaran loksabhaa kshetra pramukh hai
 a lot of atmosphere was created in Begusarai, but the Mahagathbandhan was not in front of NDA
 is seat par pichley paanch dashak main sipiai kaa koi ummidavaar jeet darj nahin kara paaya lekin daawa kiya jaataa he ki yah left kaa garh he
 Here Kanhaiya Kumar of the Left was competing with Giriraj Singh of the Right
 argedy ke pro
 Tanveer Hasan came in at number three
 chunaav se pehle charchaa ye chali thi ki kanhaiya vipaksh kaa ummidavaar hoga lekin jab ummidavaaron ke naam ghoshit kiye gaye to sachai kuch or saamne ai
 Neither RJD benefited nor did the Left
 jati kii raajnneeti main kushvaha, maanjhi or saahani se saajhedaari kar mahagathbandhan kii ranneeti yah thi ki is jati ke log saath aa jaaenge lekin yah ganit bhi kaam na aayaa
 Leaders like Upendra Kushwaha, Jeetan Ram Manjhi, Mukesh Sahni and his party failed to bring the people of this community together
 jati kaa sara ganit dharaa kaa dharaa rah gaya
 It was for the first time in Bihar politics that Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan were together in the Lok Sabha elections
 2014 main nitish kumaar kii party endie se alag chunaav ladi thi or haar gai thi
 Ram Vilas Paswan joined the NDA just before the election and also joined the government after winning
 nitish kumaar apane pichley chunaav ke samay liye gaye nirnay ko bhuule nahin the
 After Upendra Kushwaha's departure from NDA, Nitish Kumar won seats and contested elections from BJP on his own terms
 ramvilas paswan kii party lojpa bhi phaayde main rahi
 But the strategy of these two destroyed the RJD and the Grand Alliance
 bihar main hue is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main argedy or unke sahyogi dalon ko sanbhaalane vaale lalu prasad jaise manje hue netaa kaa na hona bhi kaaphi nuksaandeh sabit hua
 Its own leaders, more than the NDA, are responsible for writing the story of the defeat of the Grand Alliance

 India and South Africa are going to face each other for the fourth time in the World Cup on Sunday
 agar itihaas ke najariye se dekha jaae to aaj tak khele gaye teen maichon main south africa ne bharat ko aasaani se haraakar yah sabit kiya he ki vah bharat se aage he
 India has the experience of playing more matches in the World Cup than South Africa, but the win percentage of South Africa against India has been 100
 bharat world cap main apana pehla match 1975 se khel rahaa he, jabaki south africa kii entry 1992 main hui he
 South Africa was banned from playing international matches since 1970 due to color discrimination, but after Nelson Mandela was released from prison on 11 February 1990, South Africa was allowed to play international matches, but was elected in 1992
 Only one white player in South Africa's World Cup squad, Omar Henry, got a place in the team, due to which the selectors of South Africa faced criticism
 Yes
 sabko lag rahaa tha ki anubhav na hone kii vajah se south africa apane pehle world cap main acha nahin khelegaa, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Along with defeating India, South Africa reached the semi-finals with five wins in their 8 matches
 jab south-africa england ke khilaaf semifinal match main shandaar khel kaa pradarshan karte hue jeet kii taraf bad rahaa tha tab barish ne south-africa se yah jeet chin lee thi
 South Africa needed 21 runs from 7 balls to win, but rain caused South Africa to score 21 runs off a ball under the duckworth-lewis rule, which was impossible
 bharat ke saath khele gaye match main south africa ne bharat ko chah wicket se haraaya tha
 The match over was reduced from 50 to 30 overs due to rain
 bharat puraa 30 over khelte hue 180 ran bana paaya tha
 Captain Mohammad Azharuddin played a brilliant 79 runs
 south africa ne 29
 The match was won by losing four wickets in 1 over
 is match ke baad krishnamachari shrikant ne ekadivasiy match se sanyas le liya tha
 Like 1992, in 1999, under the captaincy of Mohammad Azharuddin, India was the second match of World Cup history against South Africa
 15 may 1999 ko khele gaye is match main south-africa ne bharat ko chaar wicket se haraaya tha
 India captain Mohammad Azharuddin scored 253 runs after batting first after winning the toss
 bharat ke openar saurabh ganguli ne is match main 97 ranon kii shandaar pari kheli thi
 South Africa scored 47, chasing a target of 254 runs
 2 over main 6 wicket par vijay lakshya praapt kar liya tha
 Kallis had scored 96 runs for South Africa and got the man of the match title
 1999 world cap main bhi south africa shandaar khel kaa pradarshan karte hue semi-final tak pahunchaa tha, lekin 1992 kii tarah 1999 main bhi bhagya ne unka saath nahin diya tha
 The semi-final match played against Australia was tied and Australia reached the final due to good run rate
 12 march 2011 main bharat or south africa ke bich world cap itihaas kaa teesraa match nagpur main khelaa gaya
 It seemed that India would beat South Africa on home ground
 sachin tendulkar ke shandaar shatak ke baavjood bhi bharat yah match jeet nahin paaya tha
 Batting first, India had set a target of 298 runs against South Africa, but South Africa won the match by three wickets
 del sten ne is match kamaal kii gendbaaji karte hue paanch wicket liye the or unhen main of da match kaa award mila tha
 Out of the three matches played between India and South Africa, India have won the toss three times and lost the match three times earlier
 sachin tendulkar ek aise khilaadi hai, jo bharat or south africa ke bich abhi tak khele gaye har world cap match main khel chuke hai

 The Congress's PC Chacko has retaliated after Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat's remarks on Kerala and Bengal politics
 congress netaa ne kaha ki jihadi takatein or sangh parivaar jahaan bhi rahenge, desh ke liye khatra rahenge
 As far as Kerala and Bengal are concerned, there is no special condition for both states
 chaako ne kaha ki bharat main charampanthi takatein apane pair jamaa rahi hai, isiilie sarkaar kaa prabandhan kamjor he
 It is worth noting that while addressing his workers on the occasion of Vijayadashami, Mohan Bhagwat said that what is happening in Kerala and Bengal
 sabko pataa he
 Jihadi forces are increasing in both states and people are protesting
 lekin, rajya sarkarein apana daayitv nahin nibhaa rahi hai
 On Bhagwat's statement, the Congress leader said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has its own agenda
 isliye vah ek group ko target kar rahaa he
 Why no one is talking about the ruthless killing of an independent socialist leader
 samaaj kaa ek varg nafrat baant rahaa he
 He said that he would not take Bhagwat seriously if he kept making similar complaints
 in logon ko pradhanmantri se shikaayat kerani chahie
 On the Doklam dispute, Chacko said that from the time the matter was resolved, China officially started protesting
 bhagwat ko yah nahin pataa hoga
 'why telecast Bhagwat's speech on Doordarshan live?' Apart from PC Chacko, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury has criticized Mohan Bhagwat for showing the speech live on national broadcaster Doordarshan
 yechuri ne twit kar likhaa ki aresas chif ko neshnal tivi par live dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Was his speech checked
 yaad rakhie ki is sarkaar ne 15 agast ko tripura ke mukhyamantri kaa bhaashan sensor kar diya tha
 Yechury said that the Nagpur telecast shows how this government deals with democracy
 vipaksh ke mukhyamantri kaa bhaashan prasaarit nahin hota, lekin aresas ke mukhiya ko puri kawarej milti he
 Which the public has not even chosen
 sangh kaa apana agenda, duusari sarkaron ko kar rahe targetdusri ore di
 The king said that Mohan could not agree with Bhagwat
 ve unke mukhiya hai or gaiyr bhaajapai sarkaron ko nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 Especially to the Government of Kerala
 ye log tripura sarkaar or pashchim bengal sarkaar par lagaataar hamale kar rahe hai
 D

 i would like to ask Bhagwat why the Prime Minister did not ask the government there to withdraw the Rohingya when he visited Myanmar
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ke paas bullate train ke liye paisa he, lekin ek pul banane ke liye nahin
 The Congress leader said that the priority of the government is the people running in AC and the general public gets nothing

 ghar se ek suicide note bhi mila he jisame vidhi ne is ghatana ke liye pati ko pareshaan naa kiye jane kii baat likhi he
 He also wrote that all his ornaments should be donated to the poor
 vidhi ne likhaa, 'main or pradeep ne sari koshish kii, lekin meraa baccha thik nahin hua

 The Chief Minister thanked the 23 crore people of the state and said that not a single riot took place in the state after the BJP came to power
 unhone kaha ki 1990 ke baad sapa ko chaar baar or bispi ko teen baar pradesh kaa kaamkaaj chalaane kaa mauka mila
 a period of widespread chaos had begun in the state during the seven-time SP-BSP rule
 yogi ne kaha ki congress ne upi ko bimaaru rajya bana diya tha

 That is, the dera is a good vote bank of Dalit voters
 yahi kaaran he ki rajaneta dalit matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke liye deron kii sharan main jate hai
 When the matter was discussed with the politicians, their answers were round
 jaahir he rajaneta nahin chaahate ki chunaavon ke dauraan un par deron main jane par koi pabandi lagaai jaae
 Politicians defer allegations of de-politicization by saying that the miri-piri theory prevails in Punjab
 yani raajnneeti or dharm saath-saath chalate hai or deron main jaakar baabaaon kaa aashirwad praapt karnaa koi buree baat nahin he
 Akali Dal spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said that it is customary to go to the deras during the election as voters meet anywhere from Gali Mohalla to Dera, Temple Gurdwara
 sabhi dere galat nahin he
 On the other hand, BJP leader Vineet Joshi said that Punjab is the land of the gurus and it is considered auspicious to take the blessings of the gurus for any auspicious work
 udhar, deron se jude kuch shraddhalu deron ke raajnneetikaran se dukhi hai
 Some devotees of Dera Sacha Sauda have approached the Election Commission to stop politics under the guise of religion
 chunaav ayog ko di gai shikaayat main kaha gaya he ki 1995 ke baad deraa sachcha sauda apana dharmik makasad bhuulakar raajnneetik khel khel rahaa hai
 He is hunting not only politicians but also his naïve devotees so that he can throw dust in the eyes of the law
 shikaayat karne waalon main shaamil deraa ke ek shraddhalu or vakil mahendra singh joshi ne kaha ki dere apane vyaktigat hit saadhane ke liye shraddhaluon kaa shoshan kar rahe hai
 Where the right candidates lose elections due to the influence of deras, people of wrong tendencies win the elections
 shikayatakartaaon ne chunaav ayog se apil kii he ki chunaav ke dauraan rajanetaaon ke deron main aane par roak lagaai jaae kyonki is chalan se na keval aachaar samhita balki piples ripregentation act kaa bhi ulanghan ho rahaa he
 The complaint was also given to the Election Commission last time but the Commission did not take any action
 or ye kahkar shikaayat kaa nipataara kar diya tha ki uske paas deron ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin he
 This time, the complainants have made it clear that if the politicization of the dera is not banned within 10 days, then they will approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court
 aise main dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kya chunaav ayog rajanetaaon ke deron main pravesh par roak lagaataa he yaa phir pehle kii tarah dere chunaavon ko prabhavit karte rahenge

 ek baar phir jammu-kashmir kii raajnneeti charchaa main he
 Governor Satyapal Malik dissolved the Assembly by taking a big decision on Wednesday evening, just before his decision, Mehbooba Mufti had claimed to form the government
 rajyapal malik nerajya vidhansabha bhangkarne ke liye jammu-kashmir ke samvidhan artical 53 ke section 2 kaa sahaara liya
 Know what Article 53 says in the state constitution
 Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik has passed an order dissolving the state Legislative Assembly
 pic
 twitter
 com / tirffzftcs — ANI (@ANI) November 21, 2018 Article 1 of Article 53 states that the Governor should call assembly sessions at regular times, but there should be no more than 6 months gap between the two sessions
 vahiin section 2 kahata he ki yaa to rajyapal sadan kaa satr chalaate rahen yaa phir vidhansabha ko bhang kar den
 Earlier, Governor's rule was in force in the state from June 20 this year after the PDP and bjp's alliance broke down in the state
 kyon lagata he rajyapal shasandesh ke anya sabhi rajyon memraajnneetik dalonke sarkaar gathan main naakaam rahane kii sthiti main raashtrapati shashan lagaaya jaataa he jabaki jammu-kashmir main maamla thodaa alag he or yahaan raashtrapati shashan nahin balki rajyapal shashan lagaaya jaataa he
 Under Rule 92 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, Governor's rule is implemented in the state for six months, although its approval has to be taken from the President of the country
 vipakshi dal naraajapipls democratic party (PDP) kii mukhiya mahabuuba mufti ne buudhvaar shaam ko rajyapal malik ke samaksh sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 On Wednesday, some parties sent by the PDP sent an invitation to form the government, while Governor Satyapal Malik dissolved the state assembly within minutes
 rajyapal ke is faisle kii kai partiyaan aalochana kar rahi hai
 Mehbooba Mufti offered to form the government, claiming the support of 56 mlas, including 29 mlas of PDP, 15 of NC and 12 of Congress
 rajya keepurv mukhyamantri mahabuuba muftin kaha ki yah puraa ghatnakram niraash karne vaala he
 The Mufti said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that the governor should have first looked into the possibilities of forming a government
 adarsh sthiti yah hoti ki vah sabase bade dal ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit karte
 'bjp's dictatorial attitude' On the other hand, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has said on this development that BJP does not want to form any other government than that
 ab rajya main teen se chaar maheenon main chunaav ho jane chahie, kyonki ham nahin chaahate ki vahaan par rajyapal shashan lagu rahe
 The bjp's dictatorial attitude has once again come in front of everyone
 neshnal conference (ensi) adhyaksh umr abdulla ne ek twit main likhaa, 'jammu-kashmir neshnal conference paanch maheenon se lagaataar vidhansabha bhang karne kii maang kar rahi thi
 It is not a coincidence that Mehbooba Mufti was going to stake claim to form the government and the Governor dissolved the assembly
 'haalanki bhartiya janata party ke pradesh adhyaksh rabindra raina ne is faisle kaa samarthan kiya or kaha ki bijepi rajyapal dwaara uthaae gaye is kadam kaa swaagat karti he
 Once again the National Conference, Congress and PDP were plotting in Jammu and Kashmir which would have been an injustice to Jammu and Ladakh
 kya ve chunaavon se pehle gathbandhan karenge? Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Bagle said, "as far as the National Security Advisor's visit to China for the BRICS NSA meeting is concerned, i can confirm that he will go
" daura 27 or 28 july ko hoga'
 When asked whether Doval would have a meeting with a Chinese leader or Special Representative of the Border Dialogue on the sidelines of the NSA meeting of BRICS (brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), Bagley did not give a direct answer
 unhone kaha, 'jab pragati hogi ham aapako avgat karaayenge'
 The comments (input bhashaa se) (from input language) (input bhashaa se) The BJP does not consider the meeting of Union Minister Giriraj Singh in jail with those accused of inciting riots to be wrong
 wo ulta sawaal kar rahi he
 Regarding the matter, BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra questioned that those who embraced Lalu Prasad Yadav, convicted in the fodder scam, have a right to question the meeting? Taking a dig at RJD, Patra said that while Lalu was in jail, So why not ask those who visit him? When the Bihar government ministers were going to meet Shahabuddin, convicted in very serious matters, why were they not asked questions? When Shahabuddin came out of jail, he was welcomed in a procession, which included many leaders
 tab kyon nahin sawaal uthaaya gaya?bataa den ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah 12 july ko patna aane vaale he
 BJP national spokesman Sambit Patra was in Patna on Monday to create an atmosphere before his visit
 yahaan media se baat karte hue paatra ne saaf kar diya ki party giriraaj singh ke saath khadi he
 Anyone who is questioning Giriraj Singh, look at the mirror
 bijepi kaa kahana he kikendriya mantri giriraaj sinhane navada jail main apane samarthakon se milakar koi gunaah nahin kiya he
 When asked for his response in the case, Sambit Patra defended Giriraj Singh and said that who can get what response in democracy, what can be the good response? Know that Bajrang sent to jail on charges of rioting in Nawada Giriraj Singh met leaders of the party and Vishwa Hindu Parishad after going to jail
 giriraaj singh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki prashasan ek tarafa karrwai kar rahi he
 On this, Chief Minister of Paribhar Nitish Kumar said that if anyone has reservations about the action, then he can go to court, but the police action cannot be pointed
 unhone kendriya mantri ke jail main aropiyon se milane par bhi aapatti jataai thi

 narendra modi sarkaar ke ek saal puraa hone par 26 may ko bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah uplabdhiyon kaa pitara thame media se rou-ba-rou the
 The last question of this press conference which lasted for an hour was - you too have been the president for almost a year, but your team is incomplete
 khinche-khinche shah kaa jawaab tha, “padaadhikari puure hai, jitani jarurat he, utane hai hamaare paas
 "but the question is why after three weeks Shah released a new list of 10 officials filling the vacant posts?" According to Shah's close friends, this is the style of Shah's style of work
 ve kabhi atakalbaaji yaa dabaav main aakar kaam nahin karte or agar kabhi karnaa bhi pade to usamen deree karte hai, jisase dabaav main na dikhen
 His identity is among those who take vocal steps that do not allow internal politics to dominate their own decisions
 darasal shah ne team punargathan kar dohari ranneeti ko anjaam diya he
 There was constant speculation in the BJP that the possible adverse outcome in the Bihar Assembly elections could hamper Shah's re-election to the presidency
 isliye ve apni team kaa vistaar nahin kar rahe or asthai team se hi kaam chalaa rahe hai
 But a leader close to Shah says, "with the speed at which they are working and taking up new ambitious work for the expansion of the party, there is no doubt that they will not get a second term as president
 ve puure damakham ke saath aage bhi adhyaksh pad par rahenge
 "this confidence Shah has tried to impress even while completing his incomplete team
 varishton ko saadhane kii nititim punargathan main amit shah ne jis tarah anjaan chehron ko jagah di he, usase varisht netaaon ko bhi saaf sandesh diya he ki sanghathan main unki hi chalegi
 According to sources, Home Minister Rajnath Singh did not want his relative Arun Singh to be made the general secretary
 lekin shah ne unki anichhaa ke baavjood arun singh ko mahasachiv banaaya
 Sources say that Rajnath did not want to appoint Arun Singh for two reasons
 pehla&un par parivaarwaad kaa aarope lagegaa or doosraa&party kaa virdohi gut rajnath ke parivaar ke bheetar se hi nayaa rajput netritv ubharkar bhavishya main unke khilaaf chunauti ke taur par pesh kar saktaa he
 Rajnath himself, while being party president thrice, did not give any major responsibility in the organization due to his relative being Arun Singh
 isi tarah om prakaash maathur bhi team main upaadhyaksh ke rup main shaamil hone ke paksh main nahin the
 Mathur was in the race with Shah for the post of president and he is also believed to be close to Prime Minister Modi
 rajasthan se rashtriya team main koi pratinidhitiv nahin tha isliye maathur ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 But sources say that Mathur wanted a place in the team according to his seniority and a formula was given that Mathur should be included in the party's highest policy making body Parliamentary Board by making him the General Secretary so that his stature would be suitable
 aam taur par sansadeey board main ek mahasachiv shaamil hota he jo board ke sachiv ke rup main kaam karata he
 Union Health Minister J
 pi
 When Nadda was the general secretary in Shah's team, he had the same responsibility
 sansadeey board kii jimmedaariyon main shah ne philhal koi pherbadal nahin kiya he
 It is being argued that Mathur had been the General Secretary earlier also and his name was run for the post of President, hence he has been made the vice-president
 lekin yah tathy he ki adhyaksh pad ke liye nadda kaa naam bhi uchhla tha, lekin mantri banaae jane se pehle ve team shah main mahasachiv the
 His stature was increased by making him Secretary in the Parliamentary Board
 sabase adhik virodh ke sur madhya pradesh kii shivaraj singh chouhan sarkaar main mantri kailash vijayawargeey ko mahasachiv banaae jane ko lekar uthe
 However, the talk of making him the general secretary started only after the bjp's victory in the Haryana Assembly elections because he played an important role as in-charge in that election
 isliye vijayawargeey ke badhate kad se madhya pradesh bijepi main halchal lajimi thi
 According to sources, Chief Minister Chauhan was trying to stop Vijayvargiya from becoming a General Secretary by saying he should be a minister in the government, on the other hand, Lok Sabha speaker and Lok Sabha MP from Indore Sumitra Mahajan, Union Steel Minister and former state president Narendra Singh Tomar, former state In-charge and Union Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers Anant Kumar, Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Avarchand Gehlot like leaders were not in their favor
 lekin kendriya sadak, parivahan or rajmarg mantri nitin gadakari unke paksh main the
 According to sources, the voice of protest on this issue reached Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi of the Sangh and he had to intervene in the matter
 aakhri faisle se pehle shah ne vitt mantri arun jetali kii maujuudagi main mukhyamantri chouhan ke saath dilli main baithak kii or apana faisla suna diya
 Ultimately, according to Shah's strategy, Kailash Vijayvargiya was made general secretary
 anjaan par yuva leadershipaisamen koi andeh nahin ki dilli kii siyasat main shah nae hai
 His organizational capacity has grown mainly in Gujarat under the umbrella of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin kendriya str par modi-shah kii jodi kaa koi apana gut nahin tha
 Therefore, in the team reorganization, Shah gave preference to those faces who do not belong to a particular faction of any big leader in the party so that these leaders can stand with the "new era" of BJP if needed in future
 shah kii team main hi rashtriya sachiv se upaadhyaksh banaae gaye shyaam jaju kehete hai, “team ke liye jari 10 naamon kii nai suchi main om maathur or mere alaava koi rashtriya str par zyada pahchaan rakhane vaala cheharaa nahin he
 The chairman has tried to give leadership to the new generation by giving preference to all the other new faces in the team as most of them are young
 ”shah ne apni pehali team ke gathan ke vakt kshetreey santulan ke saath varishthata ko dhyaan main rakhaa tha or us vakt bahut chaunkaane vaale naam nahin the
 But Shah gave the message of his style of work by giving a lot of responsibility to the new and young faces in that team
 amuman bijepi main sachivon kii jimmedaari mahasachivon ke saath sahaayak kii hoti he, lekin shah ne sachivon ko swatantra rup se rajyon kaa prabhaar saunp diya
 Although Shyam Jaju was ahead in the seniority order, he was able to become a secretary in Shah's team earlier
 lekin der se hi sahi, jaju ko party ne upaadhyaksh banaaya he
 He was also in charge of Uttarakhand as Secretary

 Even though Shah has been refusing to fill the vacancies by arguing that there are necessary people in the team for work, the reality is that the shortage of office-bearers was affecting the pace of Shah's most ambitious mass campaign
 isliye team gathit hone ke baad shah ne sabhi 10 padaadhikariyon ko mahasampark abhiyaan main jhonk diya he or unhen pravaas kaa nirdesh diya he
 a senior leader says, "the impact of the lack of people was beginning to show at work
 mahasachiv bhupendra yadav ke bihar chunaav main vyast ho jane ke baad mahaj teen logon se yah kaam sahaj nahin tha, isliye shah ne team kaa vistaar kiya he
 However, even after this team reorganization, Shah has some vacancies in his team
 bijepi ke samvidhan ke mutabik 13 upaadhyaksh, 9 mahasachiv, ek sanghathan mahasachiv, 15 sachiv or ek koshadhyaksh kii niyukti kii ja sakati he
 In addition more than one assistant may be added with the organization general secretary
 lekin punargathan ke baavjood team main upaadhyaksh ke teen or mahasachiv kaa ek pad khaali he
 However, the treasurer was neither appointed by Shah at the time of the team's formation nor under restructuring

 jedy (you) ne adhikaar raily ke jariye in logon ko 4 november ko aisa hi mauka uplabdh karaayaa
 Although the JD (U) leaders played an important role in making this rally a success, but there was too much competition in the domineering to show a strong presence
 raily ke dauraan ‘chote sarkaar’ upnaam se charchit anant kumaar singh kaa andaaj hi niraala tha, unhone tirchhi topi or kaala chashma pahan rakhaa tha
 Together, a large crowd of supporters, who carried the banner of MLA and Chief Minister

 virodhiyon ne jab hai-tauba machaana shuru kiya to raily se koi teen din pehle mukhyamantri ke nirdesh par aise kai sthanon se binar-poster hataa die gaye
 But this method of domineering in the rally gave the opponents a good chance
 argedy ke pradhan mahasachiv saansad ramkripal yadav ne kaha, ‘‘gandhi maidan main lokanayak jaiprakash narayan, jananaayak karpuri thakur or raamamanohar lohia kaa katout nahin dikhaa
 From the time of preparation of Adhikar rally, the background of the demonstration of the domineering was being prepared, which was seen on November 4
 aarope he ki logon ko dabangon kaa pehla pradarshan 27 sitambar ko khagadipha main mukhyamantri kii adhikaar yatra ke dauraan dekhne ko mila, jab jedy (you) vidhayak punam devi yadav ke bahubali pati ranvir yadav ne bodyguard kii carbine chhinakar use pradarshnakariyon par hi taan diya tha
 Ranveer is convicted in a case of mass genocide

 ke khanan ghotaale main karrwai kii thi, maamla court main lambit he
 The incident demanding the extortion of former MLA Vijay Kumar Shukla alias Munna Shukla in Muzaffarpur Shaheed Khudiram Bose Central Jail in the name of rally raised questions over the government's system
 argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ne sawaal uthaaya, ‘‘hamaari sarkaar par aparaadhiyon ko sangrakshan dene kaa aarope lagata tha, ab janata ko dekhnaa chahie ki maujuuda sarkaar main kis tarah apradhi belgaum hai
 He said that not only JD (U) leaders but also police and administrative department are involved in extortion
 unke dar se log aawaaj nahin uthaa pate
 Shukla, who reached the court for production, has completed the task of distributing the right to reach the rally
 is silsile main kai pulicekarmiyon ko nilambit kar diya gaya
 But during the rally, this style of domineering raised questions on the government's credibility, which it had difficulty in establishing
 mukhyamantri bihar ko vishesh rajya ke darje ke sawaal par 38 saal puraani, 1974 ko hui aitihaasik jepi raily kii punrariti chaahate the
 That is why he himself visited 30 districts to invite people
 lekin lagata he ki bheed jutaney kii jugat main sarkaar vaise logon ke prati naram dil ho gai, jin par sakhti hi unki ba“t badi khubi thi
 The government had to face a lot of criticism from this act of domineering and the basic theme of the rally was also affected, for which the government had been trying for months
 sawaal uthta he ki jab aise log prabhavi bhoomika main aane lagenge tab maujuuda sarkaar ke sushasan or pichhali sarkaar ke kathith ‘jangalrajya’ main kya fark rah jayega! sushasan kaa dam bharne vaali sarkaar ko is par sochna chahie

 The Delhi government has not yet implemented the minimum wage here
 iske khilaaf dilli hai court main ek yachika lagaayi gai he
 The court has sent a notice to the Delhi government on this petition
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki dilli main nunatam mazdooree 13,350 rupee die jane ko lekar sarkaraa isi saal 3 march ko notification laa chuki he
 But the Delhi government has not implemented it yet
 hairaani kii baat to yah he ki notification ke baad ulta rojgaar dene waalon ke khilaaf koi karrwai na karne ke nirdesh die gaye he
 The government's notification has come 4 months ago, it has been said in the petition that if the Delhi government implements it, about 60 lakh people will get the benefit
 yachikakarta ne kaha ki sarkaar kii niyat kharaab hone ke kaaran factory se lekar logon ke gharon me kaam karne vaale lakhon workars ko ab tak unka tay kiya gaya paisa dilwane me sarkaar kii koi ruchi nahi he
 Undocumented workers should get their salary, half of them are getting paid
 vahiin 4 maheene pehle hi sarkaar kaa notification aa chukaa he
 Removal of stay and notification to be implemented, minimum wage has been kept at least 13,350
 lekin abhi purushon ko 6 hajaar or mahilaon ko 5 hajaar kii tankhwaah hi mil paa rahi he
 That is, the people who give jobs should be given half their money in their pocket
 yachika me kaha gaya he ki ste ko hataakarnotificationako lagu karaayaa jaae
 Also, the matter of taking action against the Delhi government itself has also been written in the petition
 yachika main ek or ahm sawaal uthaaya gaya he ki 1980 me sarkaar ke vibhaag me 5 hajaar kaa staff tha
 They had to ensure that workers get minimum wages
 lekin staff bhi ab ghatakar maatr 125enforcement staffhi rah gaya he
 While the industry has now become 10 times larger in Delhi
 kisi bhi emplyer kaa ab tak nunatam mazdooree na dene par chaalaan nahin hua he
 So with 60 lakh people, this is a deception of the government over salary

 The negligence of railway officials was revealed in this accident
 railmantri ne is maamle main railway ke kai varisht adhikariyon par karrwai kii
 The case of sabotage has become bigger even before the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav vacated the government bungalow
 rajyapal ram nik ne is maamle main karrwai karne ke liye rajya kii yogi sarkaar se sifarish kii he, vahiin jaanch karaane kii bhi baat kahi gai he
 Now Akhilesh Yadav addressed the media regarding this matter
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki wo ghar mujhe milane ja rahaa tha, isliye maine use apane tareeke se banane kaa kaam kiya tha
 Akhilesh said that you showed the bottleneck of my house, did the Chief Minister's OSD go there and apart from him many IAS visited there
 akhilesh ne kaha ki mere ghar main mandir dekhakar logon ko jalan ho rahi he
 Some people have become blind in jealousy
 unhone kaha tha ki jis samay ye ghar hamen mila tha, kaaphi haalat thik nahin thi pichley ek-saal main maine kaam karavaaya
 i returned to my temple At the two-conference conference, Akhilesh showed the bottleneck and said that there is no more bottleneck than the cost of a laptop
 unhone kaha ki bangale main jo mandir he wo hamane banwaaya tha, hamen meraa mandir lautaa do
 Akhilesh said that two innocent district collectors were suspended
 lekin aaj bhi puure upi main bade paimaane par overloding ho rahi he
 He said that these people are unable to accept the defeat of Gorakhpur
 unhone kaha ki ham maanate hai ki ye faisla supreme court kaa tha lekin sarkarein bhi shadyantra karti hai
 Akhilesh said that the bottleneck is a very small thing, some of our things are also in the Chief Minister's residence
 akhilesh ne kaha ki agar jaanch main koi cheez gaayab mili to use ham waapas dene ko taiyaar he lekin ye log jaale bhune log hai
 They have no meaning with work, can this government make such a bus stand
 purv upi siem bole ki ye adhikari log mujhase kehete the ki aapkaa ehsaan nahi bhuluungaa, aaj badal gaye
 Akhilesh accused Governor Ram Naik that inside the governor is not the soul of the constitution, but the soul of the RSS
 rajyapal ne dikhaai sakhtiis maamle main rajyapal ram nik ne kaha ki aam logon se vasule gaye tex ke paison se sarkari bangalon kaa rakrakhaav hota he or bangala khaali karne se pehle kii gai todphod bahut hi gambhir or anuchit maamla he, aise main is par vidhisammat karrwai kii jaani chahie
 'damage to Government Property' The Governor wrote in a letter to the government that there is concern and discussion among the people about the demolition of the former Chief Minister's bungalow, so it should be investigated
 purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke sarkari bangale 4 vikramaditya maarg main khaali karne se pehle kiya gaya todphod bahut hi gambhir or galat maamla he
 Government property has been damaged in this
 sarkari bangale main todphod par fanse akhilesh, rajyapal ne kii karrwai kii sifarisharajya sarkaar saunpegi reportsarkaari bangale main todphod par rajyapal kii ore se karrwai ke liye likhi gai chitthee ke baad ab rajya sampatti vibhaag is maamle par buudhvaar ko report sarkaar ko saunp saktaa he
 Earlier on Tuesday, the governor called the officials of the State Property Department to get complete information about the vandalism in the bungalow
 rajyapal ram nik ne rajya sampatti vibhaag ke adhikariyon ko bulaakar purv mukhyamantriyon ke bangalon ke aavanton or rakrakhaav kii jaankaree lee, adhikariyon ne bataaya ki tamaam purv mukhyamantriyon ke bangalon kii video recording karai gai he
 After this recommended letter written by the Governor to the government, the SP has reversed the difficulties of Akhilesh Yadav, as well as politics in the state can once again be hot on this issue
 rajyapal kii is sifarish ke baad samaajawaadee party kii pravaktaa juhi singh ne kaha ki rajyapal kii ek chitthee mukhyamantri ke pradhan sachiv ke liye bhi likhi gai thi jisamen unke upar rishwat maangane ke aarope lage the, lekin us chitthee kaa kya hua jaanch ke pehle hi adhikariyon ne clin chit de di
 Photos: Did Akhilesh Shaun, who uprooted the floor of the government bungalow, say that in such a situation, there is no importance of his letter, if action is to be taken on the Governor's list, then the letter written about the Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister should be acted upon
 bijepi ke pravaktaa doctor chandramohan ne kaha ki akhilesh yadav kii kalai khul chuki he or congress ko is par jawaab dena chahie ki wo inkaa bachaav kaise karnaa chaahati he
 What did Akhilesh say on the allegations? On the charge of sabotage in the government bungalow, former Chief Minister Akhilesh broke the silence and said that he is being accused of opening the bottleneck
 philhal vah lakhanu se baahar hai or waapas lautate hi sabase pehle tonti kharid kar bhijwa denge
 He had said, 'the newspapers are writing that we took the bottleneck
 bijepi sarkaar ko jo tonti chahie, main bhijwane ko taiyaar hum
 i am in Saifai for two days, will go to Lucknow after two days, i will go after telling
 jo tonti acchhee hogi de duungaa
 They are saying that they have ransacked the house

 But even after the relationship was left incomplete, Arju and Naveen continued to meet
 yahaan tak ki naveen kii shaadi kahin or tay ho gai
 Just two days before this wedding, the story takes a new turn
 car main kii araju kii hatyashadi se sirf do din pehle wo us ladki kaa khun karata he, jisase uski shaadi hote-hote rah gai thi
 Then he brings the body of the same Arju to his room and hides it
 do farvari kii shaam ko naveen apni car main araju ke college pahunchaa or use apane saath indira gandhi international airport ke paas ek gaanv main le gaya
 There, he strangled Arju into a car and killed him

 So he returned home after putting the corpse in a car trunk
 laash kii gathree bana kar, wo use sidhe apane bedroom main le gaya
 People thought that he was carrying some wedding items
 iske baad usne araju kii laash ko apane bedroom se hi lagate ek duusare kamare ke bich kii khaali jagah main chupa diya
 After celebrating honeymoon in February in the same room, he returned home with his bride on the evening of February 5
 raat usee kamare main suhagaraat manaai or dulhan ko isaki bhanak tak nahin lagi
 Then on the evening of February 6, when the people of Arju's house put pressure and the police picked up Naveen

 Why Lee Arju's life? Naveen was afraid that Arju might create a ruckus in his wedding on February 4
