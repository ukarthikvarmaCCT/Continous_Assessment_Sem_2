 bijepi ne grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia dwaara us par tathaa rashtriya swayamsevak sangh par aatankwaadi prashikshan shivi chalaane ke aarope lagaae jane ko lekar kadaa hamalaa bolaa or congress pramukh sonia gandhi se iske liye maafee maange jane kii maang kii
 BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told reporters, "his (congress) destructive mindset is reflected in the statement of the Home Minister
 chintan shivi main unhone jo bayaan diya he vah behad aapattijanak he
 This is not only unacceptable, but also dangerous
 ’ unhone kaha ki scindia ke bayaan kaa makasad desh main shanti or samarasata ko baadhit karnaa he
 Describing the Sangh as a 'nationalist organization', the BJP leader said, "sonia Gandhi should apologize
" rahul gandhi or grahamantri ko bhi maafee maangani chahie, anyathaa iske gambhir parinaam honge
 This is not acceptable
 grahamantri dwaara is prakaar kii bebuniyadi baaten karnaa asli aatankwaadiyon ko clin chit dene jaisaa he
 The BJP spokesperson also said that Shinde's statement has given 'oxygen' to Pakistan-backed terrorism
 unhone kaha, ‘aapane bharat virdohi aatankwaadi samoohon ko bhi majbootee pradaan kii he
 Naqvi said, 'many times i feel that the Congress has become a group of cowards
 main aisa isliye kah rahaa hum kyonki desh main baar-baar aatankwaadi hamale ho rahe hai, aatankwaadi yahaan punap rahe hai
 "he said," Pakistani soldiers cut off the heads of our soldiers and our Prime Minister takes so long to react to this
 hamaari sarkaar is prakaar kii ghatnaon par koi pratikriya dene se pehle baar-baar sochati he
 She warns Pakistan only when the country is agitated, but that warning is also a warning, which makes a joke
 ’gauratlab he ki ravivaar ko jaipur main congress chintan shivi ko sambodhit karte hue scindia ne aarope lagaaya tha ki bijepi or sangh desh main bhagava aatankwaad failaane ke liye ‘aatanki prashikshan shivi’ chalaa rahe hai
 Shinde had said, 'during the investigation, there have been reports that BJP and Sangh are running terrorist training camps to spread terrorism
 samjhauta express, makka masjid main bam lagaae jate hai or maalegaanv main bhi bam visphot hota he
 'later Shinde said,' This is saffron terrorism which i talk about
 yah vahi cheez he or kuch nayaa nahin he

 ' " "salmaan khan kehete hai ki wo hataash hai
 When Salman is immersed in frustration and despair, like other stars, he neither resorts to cigarettes nor alcohol
 hataasha main jaagta he salmaan ke bheetar kaa chitrakaar
 Kutchi also did not give support to the actor Salman Khan is also a painter because he is desperate
 salmaan khan kii hataasha yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 Brush and canvas also do not support Salman
 wo tasveeron main katrina kii pyaari si bhuuli si surat dekhne ke liye kai kai raat gujaarte hai
 Salman resorts to colors when the whole world falls asleep
 lekin dher saare rang milakar bhi salmaan kii kaali- kaali raaton ko rangeen nahin bana pate
 The extent is reached when they eat too much in the case of Katrina
 haseen katrina ko hoobahoo utaarne main salmaan ajtak kaamyaab nahi ho paye hai
 Frustration due to not being a picture, when Salman's frustration does not get a picture of Katrina, the desperation of Salman is increased, but the praise is that in this storm of desperation, his thinking does not end
 salmaan ke rang nahin sookhte hai, bhale bhi manmutabik tasviir naa bane lekin wo khush ho jate hai ki canvas to rangeen ho gaya
 That is, something goes to make and something goes
 ab ishwar se hi ummidakehate hai jab sab jagah se ummid khatm ho jaati he aadmi ishwar kii taraf dekhtaa he
 Salman has the same philosophy
 jab rang saath nahin dete, kuchi man ke mutabik kaam nahin karti to salmaan canvas main apni kalpana ke ishwar ko hi saakaar karne main lag jate hai
 Salman is desperate, disappointed but not the painter Salman because he is in the shelter of God
 salmaan ko ummid he ek din unki patings unki sari hataasha ko dur kar degi
 Wake up inner vision When the artist is frustrated, his inner vision wakes up
 salmaan khan ke saath bhi yaheen ho rahaa he, lekin kya kaaran he ki salmaan khan itane zyada hataash ho gayi hai ki unhen kuchi or canvas kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he
 When Salman will marry Katrina, this question is stuck like a bone in Salman's neck, while Salman is unable to say Katrina's two words of love
 katrina ko salmaan apana jivan saathi bana paaenge yaa nahin ye salmaan kii jindagi kaa sabase bada tension ho saktaa he
 Salman has also tasted the stress of upcoming films
 salmaan khan kii filmein to aati he lekin dhadlle se flop bhi ho jaati he hoti hai
 In such a situation, Salman will be very tense about his upcoming film Wanted and London Dreams
 salmaan khan baliwood ke aise iklaute hero hai jinhone sabase zyada dushman paal rakhe hai
 It is different that Salman does not care much about his enemies, but now Salman's condition is such that Salman is starting to lack friends
 ruthe doston ko manaane kii chintaaise main salmaan kii tension ye hai ki wo apane ruthe doston ko kaise manaaen
 The more popular Salman is, the more his career has been disputed
 phir wo chaahe rajasthan main kaale hiran ke shikaar kaa maamla ho yaa phir mumbai kaa hit ange ran cese
 Salman is yet to be completely shaken by this tension
 kai baar bacchon jaisi harakatenmumbai main badhij bacchon kii bhalaai ke liye yojit ek kaarykram main ek or mukhya atithi ko shobhaa badhaani thi lekin sabkon intjaar karwaane vaale salmaan ko unhone kar diya intjaar ke liye majaboor
 At first Salman Khan kept smiling, kept talking and amused, but how long would it go on like this
 sochaa kyon naa thakaan hi mitaa lee jaay
 There is not such a habit of waiting, so the masseur is present to eliminate fatigue
 paanch minute tak apni maalish karwaane ke baad sallu miyaan kya karte, so ab paas hi main rakhe paper ko uthaakar lag gayi naav banane main
 That means lost in his childhood
 salmaan main se naav to ban nahin pai, so salmaan ne paper hi kha liya
 Just like children
 ab itnaa intazaar karnaa padegaa to bhukh to lagegi naa
 To cut the time, Salman started talking to the press, then Salman Khan was relieved

 sonaali bendre ko pichley saal july main hai grad cancer detect hua tha
 She then went to America for her treatment
 is beemaari se ek lambii ladaai ke baad sonaali waapas bharat aa gayi thi
 Sonali made public the cancer disease because she wanted to inspire millions of people to fight this dangerous disease along with her illness
 unhone apni is yatra ke kai padaavon ko soshal media par phens ke saath share kiya he
 Recently, Sonali shared a picture on Instagram
 is tasviir main ve apane 20 inch ke ghaav ke saath nazar aa rahi hai jo unhen cancer surgery se mila tha
 While captioning this picture, he wrote this idea was very incredible
 sar par koi bal nahin or naa hi koi mechap, iske alaava seene par itnaa bada ghaav
 For fashion magazines like Vogue India, this was not a traditional and simple one
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki ye mere liye ye ab saamaanya baat ho chuki he
 Obviously, it was not easy for me and i was quite insured but after talking with Priya Tanna and Anaeta Shroff Adjania, i was ready for this shoot
 View this post on instagramthe idea was almost preposterous
 An almost bald head, barely any make-up and a huge scar was not the norm for @vogue
 But, i guess that's my new normal
 Of course i had my reservations, and, if i dare say, insecurities - but a candid conversation with the lovely ladies @priya_tanna and @anaitashroffadajania cleared my doubts
 And before i knew it, i was standing in front of the camera, ready to uncover my new reality
 The icing on the cake was the fact that i needed one-third of the time for hair and make-up😄
 So i closed my eyes and jumped into it, full throttle, and this is the result
 Thank you, @meghamahindru for telling my story; and thank you @ridburman for understanding my story and saying it so beautifully through your lens
 If there's a piece of advice i can give you all after this, it would be to 'find your new normal'
 It's very liberating

 He told during this session that what is most important to fight cancer
 unhone kaha tha, 'aapke paas insurance hona bahut jaruri he kyonki cancer kaa ilaaj mahangaa hota he
 You always think that this will not happen to you and you are not ready for that
 lekin main apane anubhav se kah sakati hum ki insurance bahut jaruri he
 ' har cameraa kuch kahata he
 
 
 Yes, at the moment, a similar room-purana is going on in the Congress headquarters in Delhi
 ‘24, akbar road’ sthit mukhyalay ke ek kamare par congress ke tamaam netaaon kii najar he
 The reasons also tell you
 darasal, sonia gandhi kii jagah rahul gandhi congress adhyaksh bane to maa kaa khaali hua cameraa bete ko mil gaya
 In such a situation, the old Rohulka room, which he had got as party vice-president, became empty
 ab is kamare ke baahar koi nemplate nahin he
 In such a situation, every big leader of the party wants to get this room
 supreme netaa ke paas hi hameshaa bane rahane ke liye uske paas kii seat, paas kaa ghar, paas kaa cameraa kitna ahm hota he, yahi baangi congress mukhyalay main dekhi ja sakati he
 While the Congress President of Sonia Gandhi, two rooms in the vicinity of her room were met by the Parti treasurer Motilal Vora and Organization Secretary Janardan Dwivedi
 motilal vora kaa cameraa aaj bhi kaayam he
 The message to all the Congressmen of the country was clear, which two leaders are their most trusted and close after Sonia's political advisor Ahmed Patel
 congress mukhyalay main ahamed patel ne alag se cameraa nahin liya tha
 When Sonia Gandhi came to the headquarters, Ahmed Patel used to sit in her room or Motilal Vora's room
 rahul gandhi jab congress main mahasachiv bane the to janardan dvivedi vaale kamare par unki nem plate lag gai
 Once again, the message clearly showed that Rahul after Sonia Gandhi, according to the stature in the party
 yani jaisaa cameraa, vaisaa kad
 This politics of the room and its associated message is not hidden from anyone in the Congress headquarters
 congress mukhyalay kii mukhya building main front main ambika soni, janardan dvivedi, digvijay singh or kamalnath ke kamare hai
 On the back side are the rooms of Mukul Wasnik, BK Hariprasad
 ye saare wo netaa hai jinhen sonia gandhi kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 The front room has a room by Madhusudan Mistry, who is believed to be close to Rahul
 aise main ab jab rahul kii nai team kaa elaan hoga to usee hisaab se kamaron kaa bantwaaraa bhi hoga
 As recently Rahul appointed his close RPN Singh as in-charge of Jharkhand and a member of the working committee, he got a room with BK Hariprasad in the main building
 ab sabaki nigahen rahul ke bagal vaale kamare par tikin hai kyonki, ek taraf to 90 kii umr par kar chuke koshadhyaksh motilal vora kaa cameraa he
 That is why, on the other side of Rahul's room, the heart of all the leaders is stuck that there will be a strong message of being close to Rahul, whose planking will be there
 party netaaon kii hasarat jo bhi he lekin rahul ne is bevajaah ke sandesh se bachane kaa tod nikaala he
 Now instead of giving this empty room to a leader, Rahul has been reserved for the staff
 darasal, vora ji 90 saal ke paar hai, isliye unako team rahul ke netaa apane campatishan main nahin maanate or umr ke lihaaj se sabhi unka sammaan karte hai
 Rahul does not want any message to go, that someone is close to him or he has a quartet
 aise main unhone saath kaa khaali cameraa staff ko dena hi behatar samajha
 It is different now that it must have broken the hearts of many leaders

 There has been a steep decline in both savings and investment rates in the country
this is a sign of a long-term problem in the economy
 Both savings and investment rates are going down in India
 There is a sharp decline in the physical asset
 In the very first chapter of Economic Survey 2018-19 It has been given that a policy focusing on savings and investment should be brought
 iske anusaar, antarrashtriya anubhav yah bataate hai ki arthvyavastha main lagaataar tej badhat jari rakhane ke liye ooncha nivesh or bachat hona bahut jaruri he
 For example, China has also been mainly dependent on 'high savings and investment'
 saal 2017 main in donon kii badhat dar jidipi ke 45 fisadi tak pahunch gai thi, jab china kaa growth rate kuch sanyat tha
 The Economic Survey for GDP Growth advocates an investment-based approach like China, but emphasizes more on savings than investment
 yah tark dete hue ki growth ‘teji se badhate nivesh dar’ se judaa he, lekin yah ‘badhate bachat dar’ se zyada gaharaai se judaa he
 For this, it cited a study of 62 episodes of growth in non-oecd countries between 1960 and 2011
 bachat or nivesh dar donon main baari giravatbharat main vitt varsh 2012 se hi iske ulate halaat dekhe jane lage hai
 Savings and investment rates are going down here, which is impacting growth
 rigerv bank ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki vitt varsh 2017 main sakal gharelu bachat or sakal puunji nirmaan (GCF) yaa nivesh kii dar ek nae nichle str kramash: jidipi ke 30
 3 percent and 29
 1 fisadi pahunch gai he
 34 of GDP respectively in FY 2012
 6 fidi or 36
 Was 3 percent
 inamen vitt varsh 2018 main maamuli sudhaar hua he or yah kramash: 30
 5 percent and 29
 1 fisadi rahe
 The decline in the savings of families is of long term level
 aankadon par gaharaai se vishleshan karne par pataa chalata he ki vaise to pariwaron kii bachat kaa hissaa lagaataar prabhavi bana hua he (sakal gharelu bachat ke 50 fisadi se zyada), lekin yah hissaa haal ke varshon main teji se gira he
 34 of GDP in FY 2012
 6 fisadi se ghatakar yah vitt varsh 2018 main ghatakar 30
 5 percent is left
 isse yah baat saaf he ki sakal gharelu bachat main giravat he dirghakaalik he, na ki koi haal kii parighatna
 Two other components of gross domestic savings, public and private corporate sector savings, have improved in the meantime
 saarvajanik kshetra kii bachat vitt varsh 2012 main jidipi ke 1
 1 in FY 2018, up by 5 per cent
 7 fisadi rah gai
 Meanwhile, private sector savings respectively 9
 5 fisadi or 11
 It was 6 percent

 C
 rangarajan kaa kahana he ki pariwaron kii bachat main giravat kaa matlab yah he ki baaki aarthik vyavastha main udhaar lene yaa nivesh karne ke liye kam fund bachegaa
 He says that this decline has been taking place for a long time, which is why he considers economic lethargy as 'structural' type, although there are cyclical factors for this
 kya hoti he sanrachanaatmak or chakree susticiclical slodown yaa chakree aarthik susti arthvyavastha kii gatividhiyon ke kamjor padane ke daur main aati he
 This shot is a lethargy of the term and ends with a change in the business cycle
 duusari taraf, strectural slodown yaa sanrachanaatmak susti zyada jad tak ghusi samasya hoti he
 It is caused by a massive change in the economy
 yah lambey samay tak chalati he or ghaatak technology, badalati janasankhyaki or upabhoktaaon ke vyavhaar main badlaav kii vajah se aati he
 Reduction in physical asset-crisis indicates pre-existence
also, analysis shows that the decline in household savings is due to the rapid decline in physical asset (mainly house, land, agricultural equipment and valuables)
 16 of GDP in FY 2012, which is
 3 fisadi se ghatakar vitt varsh 2018 main jidipi ke 10
 It fell to 6 percent
 is dauraan pariwaron kii vittiya bachat-jo ki arthvyavastha main nivesh ke liye fund kaa sabase mahatvapurn strot hota he- main maamuli giravat ai he, yah vitt varsh 2012 main jidipi ke 7
 6 of GDP in FY 2018, down from 4 per cent
 6 fisadi rah gaya
 Labor economist and professor at xlri's Javier School of Management, Jamshedpur
 aar
 Shyamsunder says the steep decline in physical assets indicates that families have sold assets to meet their immediate needs, such as food, health, education and marriage, especially in rural and semi-urban areas
 isse yah bhi sanket miltaa he ki logon kii vaastavik aay kam he or usamen bhi giravat aa rahi he (kyonki isamen yogadan karne vaale anya kaarak, nominal intrest rate main pichley kuch varshon main kami aa rahi he
 ) It is not a secret that the income of the people in disposable income is declining
 maujuuda maang main giravat kii mul vajah jaanane ke liye bhartiya state bank dwaara agast main kii gai ek study main yah bataaya gaya ki isaki vajah yah he ki shahari or gramin, donon ilaakon main growth vitt varsh 2019 main ek ank main rah gai he, jabaki kuch saal pehle yah do ankon main thi
 Data from the National Statistics Office (NSO) shows that the disposable income of the people — the amount left in the disposable pocket — of personal income for consumption or savings after tax and other mandatory payments to the government — has declined
 aankadon ke mutabik prati vyakti neshnal dysposbal inakam (GNDI) main badhat vitt varsh 2014 ke 11
 9 in FY 2018, falling by 4 per cent
 8 fisadi rah gai he
 The same figure is in FY 2019
 karj aadhaarit upbhog ke din shaayad lad gaeesabiai kii sitambar 2019 kii study ke mutabik sirf byaaj daron main katautee hi kargar nahin ho saktaa, jiskaa matlab yah he ki karj aadhaarit khapat ke din chale gaye hai
 There has been a huge 58 per cent increase in the financial liability of families
 yah vitt varsh 2017 ke 4
 7 in FY 2018, up from Rs 7 lakh crore
 4 lakh karod rupee pahunch gai he
 However, according to the Reserve Bank data, there has been a fall in the loans given by banks in personal loans
 isse pataa chalata he ki personal lone main badhat vitt varsh 2016 ke 19
 16 in FY 2019, down from 4 per cent
 4 fisadi rah gai he
 This is an indication that the days of debt based consumption are over now
 bachat or nivesh kaa asantulayrthvyavastha main vibhinn sector kis tarah se nivesh kar rahe hai? ab phir rigerv bank ke aankade kuch rochak tasviir pesh karte hai
 This shows that the savings and investment gap is narrowing, but it is only positive at the level of families, which is supporting the rest of the economy, but in the case of public and private sector, from FY 2012 to 2018 It has been consistently negative
 rigerv bank ke mutabik nijee corporate sector ke bachat or nivesh kii khai main giravat yah dikhaati he ki yah sector zyaadaatar nivesh kaa vittaposhan apni bachat se kar rahaa he, or nae nivesh ke liye hasil karne kii bhukh nahin rah gai he
 On the other hand, the public sector savings-investment gap indicates that the government is constantly dependent on the savings of households to finance its activities
 is halaat par tippanee karte hue dow
 Rangarajan says that the economy is facing two basic problems - weakening demand and declining investment, both happening simultaneously
 unhone kaha ki yah halaat zyada sarkari nivesh kaa aahvaan karata he, lekin saath hi unhone chetavanee di ki nivesh sirf puunjigat vyay ke rup main honi chahie

 The candidates preparing for the Civil Services Examination have accused the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) of manipulating and rigging the results of the preliminary examination of the Civil Services
 civil seva pariksha ke ummidavaaron ne ‘transperency sikrs for acountibility’ naam ke ek sanghathan ke binar tale aaj rajdhani sthit upiessi mukhyalay par pradarshan kiya
 The head of the organization, which is leading the students' performance, said that the results of preliminary examination announced this year by UPSC have been rigged
 chitaranjan ne aarope lagaaya ki upiessi ne praarambhik pariksha main 17,000 ummidavaaron ko chunaa lekin mahaj 12,000 ummidavaaron ke nattejey saarvajanik kiye gaye
 He said that no reason was given for not announcing the remaining 5,000 results
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki praarambhik pariksha main kai aise chaatro kaa chayan hua he jinhone saamaanya adhyayan ke 150 main se mahaj 20 ke sahi uttar die jabaki vaikalpik vishay ke 120 prashnon main bhi 60-70 prashnon kaa sahi uttar diya
 Chittaranjan said that UPSC has not selected many candidates who gave correct answers to above 50 in general studies, while more than 70 questions in elective subjects
 unhone maang kii ki upiessi praarambhik pariksha ke ghoshit nateezon main is tarah ke bhedbhaav kaa kaaran bataae
 The students, who were protesting outside the UPSC office, on the condition of not disclosing the name, said that if their demands were not heard, a huge demonstration would be held at Jantar Mantar on 25 August
 ummidavaaron ke pradarshan ke babat upiessi se sampark kiye jane par ek adhikari ne kaha ki chaatro se kaha gaya he ki jinhen praarambhik pariksha ke parinaam se kisi tarah kii shikaayat he vah likhit aavedan den taaki unki maangon par vichaar kiya ja sake
 Regarding the demand for written complaint from UPSC, Chittaranjan said that seeking written application from UPSC is nothing but a way of harassing students in future by knowing the name and address of students
 gauratlab he ki kuch saal pehle bhi civil seva pariksha ke ummidavaaron ne maang kii thi ki upiessi praarambhik pariksha ke parinaam ke cat-of ank bataae taaki puri pariksha pranali main paardarshita aa sake
 The petition filed in this regard by the students is currently pending in the Supreme Court

 — Shatrughan Sinha (@shatrugansinha)november 17, 2015 Vibha, who teaches at the Corporation School in Gandhinagar in East Delhi, is traveling around the municipal headquarters of Patparganj after being on leave for the last 3 months
 somvaar ko unhone saikadon shikshakon ke saath milakar uparajyapal ke daftar par pradarshan bhi kiya or mangalvaar ko phir apni selary kii sthiti jaanane ai thim
 In fact, teachers of schools connected with East Delhi Municipal Corporation have not received salary for the last 3 months and teachers of North Delhi for the last 2 months
 ab kai aise parivaar hai, jinhen apane ghar kaa kharchaa chalaanaa mushkil pad rahaa he
 Vibha says that now it is daily
 teen chaar maheene selary nahin aati he phir hoicourt kii fatkaar lagati he to 1 maheene kii selary de di jaati he
 After this, the situation becomes the same again
 lekin ye sthiti kevalshikshakonya karmchaariyon tak hi simit nahin he
 In the East Delhi Municipal Corporation headquarters, we found more than two dozen people who have been wandering here for the last 2 years to get their payment
 yah log bataa rahe hai ki inke tractor purvi dilli nagar nigam se atech hai
 Garbage is lifted through tractors, but they have not been paid for their work for 23 months
 yah kehete hai ki yah kaisaa svachh bharat abhiyaan he, jab desh kii rajdhani dilli main hi gandagi uthaane ke badale unki pement nahin kii ja rahi he
 These people brought their complaint here even today, but it came to know that if Mayor Sahiba is busy in the party's work meeting, she will not come
 is liye sab waapas apane ghar chale gaye
 There is a shortage of funds in these corporations with a budget of thousands of crores due to tremendous corruption
 bade adhikari or netaa to maje se apana kaam chalaa rahe hai, lekin aam karmchaaree ko apane ghar kaa rashan bhi jutanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 At Kolkata's Jadavpur University Campus, the atmosphere has been heated by the arrest of 35 students protesting against the alleged molestation of the student
 maamle kii jaanch kar rahi samiti main do bahari sadasyon ko shaamil karne kii maang ko lekar chaatro ne kulapati or register ko bandhak bana liya tha
 It is said that the police allegedly lathi-charged and dragged them to check the students
 chaatro kaa aarope he ki police ne pradarshan main shaamil chaatraon ke saath bhi badasluki bhi kii
 The girl students have filed a complaint of molestation against the police
 darasal chaatro ne mangalvaar aadhi raat ko jadavapur uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar or register kaa gheraav kiya tha
 The students were adamant about being surrounded by assurances
 halaat ko kaabo karne ke liye adishnal police kamishnar devashish raay police bal ke saath uniwarsity campus pahunche
 Due to this, the situation remained tense till midnight
 visi ne gheraav ko 'torchar' bataaya he
 He said that the matter can also be resolved through negotiation
 vaais chancelar abhijit chakravarti ne kaha ki unhen jaan kaa khatra tha or agar police nahin aati to unhen maar diya jaataa
 Chakraborty told reporters, "if the police did not come, i would have killed them
" ve ham par hamalaa kar rahe the or mujhe dar tha ki hamen maar diya jayega
 'chakraborty said,' We told them to let us go, but they did not agree and so i was forced to call the police
 ' police bal ne kulapati or register ko mangalvaar tadake mukt karaayaa or 35 chaatro ko giraftaar kar liya
 The Vice Chancellor said that the committee was formed as per the directions of the High Court
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik jammu-kashmir main ek western disterbence ne dastak de di he
 The impact of this weather system is likely to persist for the next two days
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki maujuuda dablyoody bahut zyada taqatvar nahin he lekin isaki vajah se oonchai vaale ilaakon ke saath-saath kashmir ghati main mausam badalane kii khaasi sambhaavna he
 The biggest impact of WD will be seen on 4 November
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab ye he ki agle 24 ghanton main jammu-kashmir ke tamaam ilaakon main mausam karavat legaa, lekin is wedar system kaa asar uttar-pashchim bharat ke maidani ilaakon main philhal nahin dikhegaa
 According to Meteorological Director r Vishen, the western disturbance knocking in Jammu and Kashmir is slightly less powerful, so its main impact will be seen only in Jammu and Kashmir
 iske alaava himachal ke kashmir se lage janajaatiy ilaakon main bhi badalon kii awajahi ke bich halki barish yaa barfbaari kii sambhaavna bataai ja rahi he
 The highest impact of this weather system will be seen in the high altitude areas of the Kashmir Valley
 lekin is vajah se baari barish yaa barfbaari kii ashanka katai nahin he
 Talking about the temperature of the Kashmir Valley, the night temperatures here will rise slightly at the moment but a slight drop in the day temperature will be seen
 lekin jab ye wedar system aage nikal jayega to 5 taarikh se kashmir ke tamaam ilaakon main taapmaana main giravat kaa silsilaa shuru ho jayega
 The second major impact of the weakened western system will also be seen in the weather of Punjab and Haryana, but this effect will not be in the form of rain or cloud but due to increase in moisture content for the next 48 hours, the fog situation will worsen in some areas
 in ilaakon main pehle se vaataavaran main maujuud vaiu pradooshan kii vajah se smog kii sthiti agle do dinon tak bani rahegi
 In Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh, the wind is very cool at this time and here the winds are sitting from top to bottom
 is vajah se vaayu pradooshan isi ilaake main fansaa hua he
 This condition is called anti cyclonic condition in the language of meteorology
 mausam vibhaag ke mutabik is samay puure ilaake main ek se dedh kilometre kii oonchai par hawa main tehraav he lekin ye sthiti 5 november ke baad badalegi or isi ke saath uttar bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main smog kii sthiti main sudhaar aayega or isse nijaat milane kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi while wishing the students who are going to appear in the 10th and 12th grade board exams, said that they should not worry about the exam
 radio par prasaarit apane kaarykram 'man kii baat' ke dauraan apane sambodhan main pradhanmantri ne chaatro se kaha ki pariksha apni kshamta pahchaanane kaa ek tarika he, lihaaja chaatro ko apni takat pahchanani chahie
 He also suggested that 'examination Utsav' should be held twice every year in schools to remove the aspirations of the students from their minds
 piem modi ne kaha, shikshakon ko meraa suzav he ki saal main do baar kyon na pariksha utsav manaaya jaae, jisamen pariksha se judi kavitaayen sunai jaaen, pariksha par vyangy ho, pariksha par cartoon banaae jaaen
 This will go a long way in clearing the examination of students from their minds
 unhone kaha ki chaatro ne raat-raat bhar jagakar jo padhai kii he, vah bekaar nahin jaaegi
 They must trust their ability
 pariksha main kabhi bhi zyada tanaav nahin paalna chahie, ise boj kii tarah nahin lenaa chahie
 Advising the students not to live in the old ways, Modi said that they should live life in the present and do their best in the exam
 abhibhavakon ko chaatro ke man main pariksha kaa hauva na paidaa karne kii naseehat dete hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki har roj pariksha se aane ke baad chaatro se yah nahin poocha janaa chahie ki paper kaisaa gaya? Agreeing with the advice of R
 Kamat, who hails from Tamil Nadu, Modi told the students that they should become 'warrior' or warrior rather than 'warrior'
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, mahatma buddha kaha karte the 'atyadipo bhav' yani aap apane maardarshak ban jaaie
 i believe that you recognize the light within you
 apane 25 minute ke sambodhan main chaatro kaa utsaah badhaate hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, main nahin jaanata hum, meri baaten kisko kitni kaam aaengi
 But i will be satisfied that at the crucial moment in my young friends' life, i was among them, humming my thoughts with them
 unhone yah bhi kaha, main ek prakaar se bahut hi saamaanya str kaa vidhyaarthee rahaa hum, kyonki maine mere jivan main kisi bhi exam main achche parinaam praapt nahin kiye the
 My handwriting was also very bad
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, main aaj ek baat jarur aapse kahana chaahunga ki aap pariksha ko kaise lete hai, is par aapaki pariksha kisi jaaegi, ye nirbhar karti he
 Most of the people i have seen say that they consider it to be a very important event in their life and they feel that if not, the whole world will be drowned
 dosto, duniya aisi nahin he
 And so don't ever get so stressed
 haa, acha parinaam laane kaa iraadaa hona chahie or hausala bhi buland hona chahie
 He said, sometimes it doesn't seem that we make the exam a burden? One reason for creating more burden in the house is that our relatives, our friends or friends, their son or daughter read on par with our son, if your son is in tenth, and your relatives If the son is in tenth, then your mind always keeps comparing that my son should go ahead of them, you should be ahead of your friend's son
 bas yahi aapke man main jo he, wo aapke bete par pressure paidaa karvaa detaa he

 i am overwhelmed to receive this award, as it is chosen by a foundation full of the most intelligent personalities who have already made it clear to me that this is not a political award
 yah patrkaar kii swatantraaa ke liye bahut mahatvapurn he, kyonki meraa drudh vishwaas he ki nyaaypalika ko sarkaar se alag rahanaa jitna zaruri he, utana hi zaruri netaaon se patrakaron kaa algaav bhi he
 Journalists' close proximity to leaders has an uneasy tendency; Leaders are by nature attractive people, and journalists around the world are cautioned not to be swayed or enthralled by the charm and power of leaders, as this would make their work - fair reporting - extremely difficult
 algaav ke vyapak str par, pichley kuch dashakon main bharat main sarkaar or televijan ke bich sambandhon main teen bade badlaav dekhe gaye, or enditivi main hamane in charnon main se prayek se siikhaa or aage bade hai - vastav main hamaara itihaas unamem se prayek ke saath judaa hua he
 First: Three decades ago, it was a period of 'boycott to control'
 televijan patrkaar, jo sarkari media kaa hissaa nahin the - 'ambeded' nahin the, to ve raashtra se alag kar die gaye the - apane hi desh bharat par khabar karne kaa koi adhikaar nahin tha, apane peshey kii practice kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 This was the period when NDTV tried to push the boundaries by becoming the first non-governmental organization to show news on television
 haalanki tab ise desh kii nahin, balki sirf antarrashtriya khabaren hi dikhaane kii ijaajat mili thi, isliye hamane ‘da world dis wyk’ shuru kiya
 Once established, and with the support from our audience, we set out to become the first non-state television media to show news on India - and then launch the first 24-hour news channel in India
 'bahishkaar se niyantran' kaa daur jab khatm hua, to phir doosraa daur 'dhamkee se niyantran' kaa aayaa - yah vah daur tha, jisamen netaa patrakaron ko phone karte or khabaron main unke manmutabik badlaav nahin karne par gambhir parinaam bhugatne kii chetavanee dete the
 In reality, nobody cared about these threats and India's journalists should be praised for this
 patrakaron kii ranneeti kaaphi saral hua karti thi - suno, kuch nahin karo or phir yah khud khatm ho jayega
 i remember one such threatening phone call: "you know i have been a true supporter, but if i keep doing similar work, i will not be able to do anything
" duusare log mujhe aapaki company ko band karne ke liye majaboor kar denge
 Please close these reports
 ' i have done absolutely nothing with these phone calls as always
 hamane sunishchit kiya ki field main reporting kar rahe patrakaron ko phone kol yaa dhamkee kaa pataa nahin chale
 Nothing changed in our reporting
 kuch ghante baad usee netaa se mujhe phir phone kol aayaa, jisamen usne mujhe kaha, 'apni khabar ko badalane ke liye bahut-bahut dhanyavad!' maine kuch nahin kaha
 This phase lasted about 10 years ago
 phir netaaon ne bas koshish karnaa chhod diya
 No more phone calls
 or meraa yakeen karen, un logon ke phone colls ham kabhi miss nahin karte! However, then a new round began after this, with more subtle methods of control and perhaps more deadly methods than phone calls
 teesraa daur 'mekkarthism kii takanic kaa upyog kar niyantran' kaa tha
 Meccarthism is widely considered to be the darkest period in recent history in the United States
 is daur main, epabiai or kar vibhaag jaise sarkari mahakme, lagbhag har jane-maane patrkaar or hollywood ke saikadon prabhaavshaalee logon ke khilaaf jhuthe maamle darj kara dete the
 This was the period when America was seen as 'communist everywhere' (red under every bed)
 yah pravriti, jo 10 saal pehle shuru hui thi - ab bharat main bhi hamane har ore rashtravirohi or rashtradrohi dekhnaa shuru kar diya he
 This third round will also pass like the other two
 tab tak ke liye hamaara puraa samarthan or sahanubhuti desh bhar ke hamaare un sabhi patrakaron ke saath he, jinhen bina kisi aparaadh ke, sirf apni nirbhik reporting kii vajah se peeta ja rahaa he or jail main daal diya gaya he
 i am confident that this period will also pass, because the media of India has fought with the control of the state every time; Each time, it has emerged free and stronger than before the fight
 agar mujhe tamaam partiyon ke netaaon or sarkaron ko koi sandesh dena ho, to vah yah he - bharat ke media ko kuchliye nahin, balki viksit kiijie, kyonki is desh ke logon ke liye, hamaara media hamaari sabase badi sampattiyon main se ek he
 India's media will soon one day show CNN and the BBC what a lively and fair debate really is like without any limitations
 is par najar rakhie - bharat ke media ko dekhie - aapane abhi tak kuch bhi nahin dekha he

 The head of the place bought about 100 bighas of land which he had gone to occupy with his supporters two years ago
 sthaneey logon ne iskaa virodh kiya
 After this there was a ruckus
 isamen 3 mahilaon samet 10 logon kii maut ho gai
 According to the local people, during the dispute, many people were seriously injured due to the actual firing and raging
 graminon ke mutabik pradhan paksh or gaanv ke duusare paksh ko lekar jameen kaa vivaad tha
 The debate over the land dispute started on Wednesday afternoon which took the form of a bloody struggle
 dekhte hi dekhte khet main laashen bich gayi
 The matter is not about 100 bighas of land of the village head
 puraa maamla dekhen to vivaad yahaan kii mukhya rup se do jatiyon ke bich kaaphi arase se jari tha
 The third party is the revenue department here which was aware of this dispute for many years, but blindly as if this day is waiting
 umbha gaanv main 200 bighas jameen kaa vivaad lambey samay se chalaa aa rahaa he
 The people of Gurjar (bhurtia) and the God fraternity have been coming face to face to occupy this land
 ab tak maamla bich bachaav se sulajh jaaya karata tha lekin buudhvaar ko aisa nahin hua or donon jatiyon kii ladaai ne hinsak rup le liya
 The head of Umbha is mainly involved at the center of the dispute, whose people had gone to capture the fields with the Ashalas on Wednesday
 pradhan kaa naam yajyadutt singh he
 Last year, Yajnadatta had registered about 100 bighas of land in the name of himself and his family members
 buudhvaar ko iskaa kafila jab kheton kii ore niklaa to inkaa dhyaan 200 bighas jameen par jutai kaa tha
 In protest against this, the people of God caste settled in the fields and the matter turned into a bloody struggle
 media reports main bataaya gaya he ki buudhvaar lagbhag 11 baje yajyadutt singh 30-32 traaliyon ke saath vivaadit khet main pahunchaa
 Two hundred Gurjars were from the community with him
 in logon ne vivaadit jameen par jutai shuru kar di
 When people of God community came to know about this, they started protesting
 ghatana kii bhanak lagate hi kuch god birdari ke log kheton main jamaa ho gaye the lekin sangharsh badhane ke saath inkaa or jamaavada ho gaya
 People from both sides came face to face and violence increased
 charchaa ye he ki gurjaron ne asalhe or gadaase se hamale kiye jabaki god jati ke log patharav karte rahe or lathi danda virodhiyon par barasaate rahe
 On seeing this, the land of the farm was stained with blood and shouts were heard all around
 rajasav vibhaag or socity kaa khelgod, gurjar ke alaava do paksh or hai jinke khel ne puraa maamla bigaad diya
 There is a discussion in the media that 600 bighas of land in Umbha village are in the name of Adarsh cooperative Society
 haalanki is socity kaa registration 1973 main hi samaapt ho gaya tha
 Since then, such a large part of the farms were in dispute as to whose name it is
 ek taraf god birdari ke logon kaa kahana he ki kaaphi arse se ve in kheton kii jutai karte the or kheti kar uparjan karte the
 On the other hand, the parties of Gurjar and village head Yajnadatta say that they bought the land, so they have the right to legally tillage
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki rajasav vibhaag ko jab pataa tha ki jameen ke itane bade hisse par vivaad he to usne isaki jaankaree prashasan ko kyon nahin kii yaa ehtiyaat ke kadam kyon nahin uthaae?adarsh kooparative socity kaa naata ek iees se jud rahaa he
 According to reports, in 1989, out of this land (total 600 bighas), 100-100 bighas of land was transferred to the IAS officer, his wife and daughter
 doosraa paksh yajyadutt singh kaa he jisane lagbhag 100 bighas jameen apane naam se kharidi thi
 The third party belongs to the Gond castes who used to cultivate it long ago and claim their ownership
 teenon pakshon ke vivaad ke chalate yah maamla court main chalaa gaya tha or is par mukadmaa bhi chal rahaa tha
 The matter is currently pending with SDM
 sawaal he ki itnaa bada vivaad jab saamne tha or itane log isamen shaamil the to prashasan apni karrwai main kyon dhilaai bartaa rahaa? Earthquake tremors have been felt in Uttarakhand

 logon main is baat kaa khauf ban gaya he ki naa jane kab emsidi kaa hathaudaa unke ghar or dukaan ke baahar pahunch jaae
 a similar situation is in Satnam Road under the Krishna Nagar area of east Delhi where people who have settled their homes for more than 60 years are very angry about the corporation's action
 darasal, purvi dilli nagar nigam ke antargat aane vaali satnam road par kaaphi had tachhatikramanhua he jiske chalate is road ko chaudaa kiya janaa he jo lagbhag 100 foot he, lekin atikaraman ke kaaran ye road kahin 45 foot to kahin 60 foot he jis par ab nigam jald hi hathaudaa chalaane ja rahaa he jiske kaaran yahaan rahane vaale logon ke dilon main dehshat kaa mouhaal bana hua he
 For the last 63 years, we have been living in the shelter on Satnam Road
 inhen main gurdeep singh or unki patni surajeet cor bhi shaamil hai jinhen dukh he or unki ankhon main aaj aansu hai
 If the Satnam Road is widened from the MCD side, Gurdeep Singh's house will be completely broken and his whole family will come on the road
 gurdeep singh or unki patni ko jab se yah pataa chalaa he tab se unki raaton kii neend ud gai he
 According to Gurdeep Singh, in 1955, he took this house, which he also has a registry and map
 baavjood iske unka makaan todaa ja rahaa he
 Like Gurdeep Singh, Sunil Khanna has the same condition
 unhone bhi kuch saal pehle yah soch kar satmaan road par dukaan lee thi ki dukaan kii pakki registry he or nakshaa bhi paas he to unhen koi dikkat nahin hogi
 But recently, due to encroachment of his shop by MCD, he has also lost his night sleep
 yahi haal yahaan saalon se baithe har dukandaar or makaan maalik kaa he
 However, this road comes under two corporation councilors, one of which corporator Sandeep Kapoor believes that whatever action the corporation takes should be done in a planned manner so that the shopkeepers do not suffer much damage while the other councilor Shyam Sundar Agarwal believes that the road is encroached It is enough that people living in residential areas have a lot of problems
 is road par jitna bhi atikaraman he usko hataaya jaae
 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party is also blaming the Nagar Nigam and the BJP for this
 krishna nagar se aam aadmi party ke vidhayak esake bagga kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke nigam parshad khud chaahate hai ki road chaudee ho, lekin aam aadmi kii pareshaani se unako kuch lenaa dena nahin he

 mausam vibhaag ne bataaya ki devnar damping ground main aag se bahut adhik dhuna paidaa hua he, jo jald hi purvi upnagareey ilaakon main fail gaya
 People also shared videos of it on social media

 On Saturday, the fire suddenly caught some speed, adding to the smoke

 These days, there is a lot of discussion in the industry of Vishal Bhardwaj's next film
 abhinayta saf ali khan or shahid kapur saath-saath pehali barvishaal bharadwajki aagaamee film ke liye lead main chune ja chuke hai
 Talking about the recent discussion about this film, according to an English newspaper, along with Shahid and Saif, Kareena Kapoor Khan's name was also revealed for the cast of this film
 akhbaar ke mutabik, saf chaahate hai kii bebo ko is film main chunaa jaae or vahiin shahid kaa bhi maananaa he kii karina lead kirdaar ke liye ekadam sahi rahengi lekin mekars ne shaayad is edia ko khaarij kar diya he or abhi tak koi bhi actress final nahin kii gayi he
 If Kareena is signed in the film then it will be quite interesting because once upon a time Shahid and Bebo were in a relationship and later Kareena took Saif Sangshadikar
 khayr, philhal shahid or karina film'udata punjab'kii shooting main vyast hai or saf ali khan apane agle projects kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 There is no statement from any of these actors yet about Vishal Bhardwaj's upcoming film

 a photo of a Mexican woman has sparked a new debate on the Internet
 aapako bataa den ki mahila pregnent thi, lekin ek clinics ne use bhartee karne se inkaar kar diya
 In such a situation, the woman delivered the child in the hospital lawn
 vahaan se guzar rahe ek shaks ne is hairaan kar dene vaale manjar ko apane camere main kaid kar liya
 The woman seen in the picture is Irma Lopez
 uske chehre se dard saaf taur par jhalak rahaa he or uskaa navjaat baccha jameen par padaa hua he
 At the same time, the government has ordered the hospital director Dr
 Adrian Cruz to investigate
 teen bacchon kii maa lopage kahati hai ki wo delivery ke liye 2 oktober ko apane pati ke saath gaanv ke rural health centre gayi thim, lekin vahaan kii nurse ne unhen yah kehete hue bhartee karne se manaa kar diya ki wo abhi sirf 8 maheene kii pregnent hai or delivery ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 The couple did not know Spanish and they could not understand more what the nurse was saying
 unhen sirf 'nahin' shabd samaj main aayaa or ve vahaan se baahar aa gaye
 The nurse blamed linguistic difficulty for the dispute and claimed that he was short of staff and therefore unable to treat the woman
 jab aspataal ne lopage ko bhartee karne se inkaar kar diya to uske dedh ghante baad mahila kii emniotic thili fat gai
 Let me tell you that before the birth of a child, this sac bursts on its own, which is called 'water breaking'
 lopage ko abhas ho gaya tha ki ab bachche ke janm kaa samay aa gaya he
 She sat outside the clinic
 usne ghaas ko mutthi main pakadaa or push karnaa shuru kar diya
 According to Lopez, "I didn't want to deliver like this
 yah behad kharaab or dard bharaa tha
 She told that she was alone when she gave birth to the child as her husband had gone to the nurse to ask for help
 jis shaks ne mahila kii tasviir khinchi thi usne ise press main de diya

 He, however, insisted that everyone, including Modi, wanted a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya
 unhone isse inkaar kiya ki unhone sarkaar ko koi dhamkee di he
 He stated that he had been wrongly coat
 unhone daawa kiya ki vah modi ke sainik or unke prashansak hai
 'I did not say about making or breaking the government', the witness said, 'how can i say that i can make or break the government
 is tarah kaa ahankaar ek murkh ko bhi nahin shobhaa detaa
 Modi is the divine power of India
 main unka sainik hum

 bharat kii pragati ke liye unke paas jo vichaar hai or vishwa main unka jo sthaan he, vah kisi aam aadmi ke liye sochna bhi sambhav nahin he
 Asked about his statement regarding the four children of Hindus to counter the increasing population of Muslims, he said that he wants equal civil law for all communities as the country's growing population is a matter of concern

 2 at the current price of petrol to companies selling petroleum products, according to a top government official
 61 rupee litre kaa nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 In total, the three oil companies are incurring a daily loss of Rs 15 crore on petrol
 sthaneey kar aadi milakar petrol ke daam teen rupee litre tak badhaane pad sakate hai
 In June last year, the government freed petrol prices from government control
 kabhi antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel ke daam badhane to kabhi dollar ke mukaable rupee kii vinimay dar girane se tel companiyon kii laagat badhati chali gai
 Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have lost Rs 2,450 crore on sale of petrol so far this year
 petrol ke daam yadi maujuuda str par bane rahe to tel companiyon ko varsh kii baaki avadhi main 2,850 karod rupee kaa nuksaan or uthaanaa hoga
 Overall the loss of Rs 5,300 crore during the year will be on the sale of petrol only
 adhikari ne kaha is lihaaj se tel companiyon ko jald hi petrol ke daam badhaane pad sakate hai
 Oil companies are also losing Rs 263 crore daily on diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene

 We are all in 'bai'
 bachapan main suna tha ye shabd
 Means are fleeing indiscriminately
 tab zindagi raftaar ko alag se dekh leti thi, ab raftaar hi zindagi he
 In such a situation, if a film stays in our mind, then there is no other city left for the man to escape
 aligarh ne raftaar kaa saath diya, magar ab wo thaharne laga he
 Both city and university
 mujhe ummid thi ki jahaan-jahaan aligarh ke padhe chaatro kaa samooh he, vahaan ye film dikhaayi jaaegi or dekhi jaaegi
 Aligarh is not the name of a station that it should remain standing and vehicles with changing speed can pass through there
 aligarh dharanaon ke boj se dabaa ek shahar or talim kaa idara he
 a professor walking in its corridor would walk in the shadow of heritage, but whether his steps would be moving towards Mustaqbil or he would turn towards Mazi
 professor sirus kii kahani ko agar tab ke chaatr nahin samaj paye to kya ab samaj sakate hai
 For this, it is necessary to get out of the hostels and go to Aligarh
 vishvavidhyalayon ke bheetar vividhta ko lekar eemaandaar bahes ho tabhi ham abhivyakti kii vividhtaon par ho rahe bahari hamale kaa saamana kar paayenge
 The crowd does not always come from outside
 bheed hameshaa baahar kii bheed ke muqaabale main nahin banati he
 The crowd is made up of 'loved ones' and someone inside also turns us all against the loved ones
 ham sabko dekhnaa hoga ki ham baahar kii bheed ke kilaaf hai yaa bheed banane kii pravriti ke kilaaf bhi
 In this time when we are surrounded by all kinds of crowds, the Aligarh film shows the way out of it
 professor sirus ke ghar main pehle choti bheed ghusati he
 Later a large crowd comes and then raises the question, which makes no difference
 aligarh ek aisi film he jise dekhte samay film dekhne ke anubhav ko bhi chunauti milti he
 The biggest feature of this film is that it does not claim to be like the film
 aligarh kii kahani jeenyu kii ghatana se kitni milti he
 The film runs on many levels
 professor sirus shabdon ke bich bachi hui kisi agyaat jagah main rahanaa chaahate hai
 Words are so clouded that the country of new unknown words wants to go to America
 unke liye har ahsaas shabd nahin he jaise ki har acha kaam zaruri nahin ki adbhut, adwitiya or shandaar hi ho
 But in this world we are all bound in the clutches of words
 isse mukti kaa rasta kisi ko maaloom nahin
 The comments us kirdaar ko manoj vaajapeyi ne shabdon ke bina jeene kaa prayaas kiya he
 He speaks more even when speaking less
 har vakt ek nirmam udaasi ko laade chale aa rahe hai, magar kirdaar bheetar se kitna bharaa-puraa he
 What is full from outside, how empty it is from inside, how empty it is from inside
 ek aise samay main jab patrakaron ke bare main kya-kya kaha ja rahaa he, aligarh film kaa patrkaar buniyadi sawaalon ke jawaab khojane jaataa he
 It was nice
 media samaaj kii rachanaaen kamazor shaks ke liye behad krur hoti he
 Even after winning from the court, the professors lose or are defeated under the same intrigue, due to which they are declared criminals for the first time
 acha laga ki naujavaanon ke saath dekh rahaa tha
 i believe there are some people who want to understand the world
 zindagi ko khojna chaahate hai
 i have come to see Aligarh shabdon kii tarah pasand-naapsand ke daayre se nikalne kaa asar hua he tabhi to ye nahin likh paa rahaa ki film kisi he
 Is upside down
 yah film hameen se puuchhati he aap kaise hai? aise kyon hai? Aligarh is a city burdened with perceptions and a school of education
 iske galiyare main chalata hua koi professor viraasat ke saaye main hi chalata hoga, magar kya uske qadam mustaqbil kii taraf badhate honge yaa wo maazi kii taraf mud jate honge
 If the students of Professor Sirus could not understand the story then can they understand now? iske liye jaruri he ki hostalon se jattha nikle or aligarh dekhne jaae
 We should be able to face the external attack on diversity of expression only when there is an honest debate about diversity within universities
 bheed hameshaa baahar se nahin aati he
 The crowd does not always form against the outside crowd
 bheed 'apano' se bhi banati he or koi bheetar kaa bhi apano ke kilaaf ham sabko bheed main badal detaa he
 We all have to see whether we are against the crowd outside or against the tendency of crowd formation
 is samay main jab ham sab tarah-tarah kii bheed se ghire hai, aligarh film usase nikalne kaa rasta bataati he
 The first small crowd enters Professor Sirus's house
 baad main badi bheed aati he or phir wo sawaal khadey detii he, jiskaa koi tuk nahin hota
 Aligarh is a film that challenges the experience of watching a film while watching it
 is film kii sabase badi kubi he ki film kii tarah hone kaa daawa nahin karti
 The story of Aligarh resembles that of the JNU incident
 film kai staron par chalati he
 Professor Sirus wants to live in an unknown place left between words
 shabd se itane ghir jate hai ki nae anjaan shabdon ke mulk america janaa chaahate hai
 Not every feeling is a word for them, as every good deed is not necessarily amazing, unique and magnificent
 par is duniya main ham sab shabdon ke shikanje main bandhe hue hai
 No one knows the way to get rid of it
 tippaniyan Manoj Vajpayee has tried to play that character without words
 kam bolte hue bhi ve zyaada bolte hai
 All the time, they are carrying a ruthless sadness, but the character is so full from within
 jo baahar se bharaa-puraa he wo andar se kitna khaali he, jo baahar se khaali he wo andar se kitna bharaa he
 At a time when what is being said about journalists, Aligarh film journalist goes to find answers to basic questions
 acha hi laga
 The creations of media society are extremely cruel to the weak
 adaalat se jeet kar bhi professor haar jate hai yaa unhen usee saazish ke tahat haraa diya jaataa he, jiske kaaran ve pehali baar apradhi qaraar diye jate hai
 It was nice watching with the youngsters
 yaqiin hua ki kuch log hai jo duniya ko samajhnaa chaahate hai
 Want to find life aligarh dekh aayaa hum
 Like words, there is an effect of coming out of the realm of likes and dislikes, only then it is not able to write how the film is

 yah film hameen se puuchhati he aap kaise hai? aise kyon hai? On Wednesday, the university administration presented its case in the case of renowned historian Romila Thapar, who has been serving for the past 49 years at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)
 prashasan ne kaha he ki duusare kaabil ritair shikshak jo ameritas ban se chook gaye hai, ab naye niyamon se unhen mauka diya jayega
 At the same time, JNU Teachers Association has called it insulting to ask for CV
 prashasan ne kaha he ki jeenyu main professor ameritas maamle main kai samachar patr or soshal media main ekapaksheeya raay failaai ja rahi he
 This is being done with the aim of bringing the administrative reforms into disrepute
 ye nirnay prashasan dwaara vaidhanik or adhyadeshon par aadhaarit he
 Last year, a move was taken by the JNU Executive Council, which included deans, chairpersons and renowned academics from outside the university's highest statutory body, JNU
 isamen niyuktiyon kii prakriya or emiritus professor ke padon kii nirantarata ko viniyamit karnaa tha
 All the rules were discussed in it
 is maamle main register ne kaha he ki vartmaan main, jeenyu main 21 ameritas professor hai
 It has 17 professors from social sciences and humanities and 4 from sciences
 jeenyu prashasan ne kaha he ki bahut se or log pro amertis banane se chook gaye the jo puri kaabiliyat bhi rakhte hai
 The JNU administration said that the aim of the administration was to broaden the age limit of Pro Emeritus and their appointment, so that justice could be done with retired deserving teachers
 vishvavidhyalay ke naye shaikshanik niyam or vinium 32 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki iske tahat 75 varsh kii aayu praapt kar chuke prophessoron se anurodh kiya gaya he ki wo apane countribution bataaen taaki sthiti kii samiksha ke liye gathit ek samiti is par gaur kar sake
 The administration said that everyone is equal in law, letters were sent to all 12 Emeritus Professors, who have attained the age of 75 to know their availability and willingness to participate in the academic activities of the University
 lekin sirf ek emiritus professor ke naam kaa upyog karke ek abhiyaan chalaaya gaya
 The JNU administration reiterated that no Emirati professor has been targeted, as has been falsely accused
 ye keval ek niyam ko lagu karne kii maang kii he jo vishvavidhyalay ke adhyadesh kaa hissaa he
 Insulting to ask for CV: JNU Teachers Association, President of JNU Teachers Association Prof
 Atul Sood said that the JNU administration said on the first day that we are only submitting information, we do not want to remove, only we want to know their availability and willingness
 lekin, chitthee ke vishay main hi likhaa tha ki continunation ke bare main nirnay karne ke liye jaankaree maangi ja rahi he
 Professor Sood said that emeritus is selected on the basis of one's work during the professorship
 wo vishvavidhyalay ko sivi nahin dete balki vishvavidhyalay unhen unke kaam ke aadhaar par aamantrit karata he
 Now the question is that when he was not asked for CV at the time of making emertis, now CV was sought on the same basis
 pro sood ne kaha ki uniwarsity bhavishya main jo bhi niyam bananaa chaahe uniwarsity body ke dwaara bana sakati he, lekin jinako puraane vaais chancelar ne banaaya unhen wo nahin badal sakate hai
 This was the case on behalf of JNU Registrar Pramod Kumar, a letter was issued to historian Romila Thapar
 beete maheene jari kiye gaye is patr main vivi prashasan ne likhaa tha ki vah unke kaam kaa akalan karnaa chahta he, jiske liye unka sivi aavashyak he
 Such Emeritus Professors are nominated: The retired eminent name proposed by a faculty is nominated as Emeritus Professor after approval of Executive and Academic Council

 iske baad kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki asad sarkaar ko hataane kii ranneeti se america peeche hat saktaa he lekin rasinic hamalon ke baad trump ne kaha ki is ghatana ne unako phir se sochane par majaboor kar diya he
 Perhaps this is the result of the fact that the US has launched such a direct attack on Syrian military bases
 obama daur main america, asad sarkaar ke khilaaf lard rahe vidrohiyon kaa samarthak mana jaataa rahaa he
 The comments ullekhneey he ki pashchimottar syria ke idalib praant main mangalvaar ko hue bheeshan rasinic hamale main kam se kam 100 logon kii maut ho gai, jinamein kai bachche bhi shaamil hai
 In addition, more than 400 people have been injured

 It is not clear whether the aircraft used for the attack were Syrian or the government's ally of Russia? a Facebook post in this regard stated that four thermobaric bombs containing chlorine gas were dropped

 bollywood star ruthik roshan bhale hi kam filmein karte hai, lekin unki filmon kaa box offis par pradarshan aamtaur par acha hi rahata he
 His last four films 'zindagi Na Milegi Dobara', 'agneepath', 'krrish 3' and 'bang Bang' were not only different genre films, but the audience also liked them all
 yahi kaaran he ki unki agali chah filmon ke satellite rhite ke badale ab unhen 550 karod rupee dene ke liye koi taiyaar ho gaya he
 Hrithik has signed the deal, and it will come into effect from next year i
e
 2017
 tippaniyan Hrithik Roshan's 'kaabil' is going to be released next year, whose satellite rights have already been sold for Rs 45 crore
 lekin ab is nai deal ne sabit kiya he ki ruthik box offis ke behad majboot sitare hai
 Significantly, this new deal has also left Hrithik behind the strongest box office star Salman, as Salman Khan got Rs 500 crores for a similar deal
 vaise, ajay devgan or varun dhawan bhi is tarah kii deal kar chuke hai, jinamein se varun dhawan ko 300 karod rupee die jane kii khabar he
 This is the reason that someone has now agreed to give them Rs 550 crore in exchange for satellite rights for his next six films
 ruthik ne deal sin kar lee he, or yah agle saal, yani 2017 se lagu hogi
 The comments agle saal ruthik roshan kii 'kaabil' pradarshit hone ja rahi he, jiske satellite rhite pehle hi 45 karod rupee main beche ja chuke hai
 But now this new deal has proved that Hrithik is very strong box office stars
 gauratlab he ki is nai deal se ruthik ne box offis ke sabase majboot star salmaan ko bhi peeche chhod diya he, kyonki salmaan khan ko isi tarah kii deal ke liye 500 karod rupee mili
 By the way, Ajay Devgan and Varun Dhawan have also done similar deals, of which Varun Dhawan is reported to have given Rs 300 crore

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ko lekar ek baar phir bhartiya janata party (bijepi) par hamalaa bolaa he
 He (arvind Kejriwal) also made a tweet on Wednesday about his demand
 arvind kejariwal(arvind Kejriwal) ne likhaa ki atal ji dilli ko purna rajya banane ke liye sansad main bill laae the
 The BJP is seeking votes by rotating Atal ji's ashes across the country, but does not want to fulfill Atal ji's unfulfilled dream
 khaas baat yah he ki arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne yah twit bijepi netaa or kendriya mantri vijay goyal ke us twit ke jawaab main kiya tha jisamen unhone likhaa tha ki na mamata banerjee ne sansad main kabhi purna rajya kaa mudda uthaaya, or na bees saal main kabhi unhone dilli ke purna rajya kaa samarthan kiya
 The opposition parties with whom Kejriwal is seen to be raising his hands should first ask those leaders to support the entire state
 atal ji dilli ko purna rajya banane ke liye sansad main bill laae the

 Arrears worth thousands of rupees were demanded
 perants main baari rosh tha

 co / bfnsttougkgorawalaba he ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja dilaane ko lekar arvind kejariwal pehle kaha tha kidilli main purna sarkaar hone par das saal ke bheetar prayek parivaar ko sasti or aasaan kishton par ghar muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 Arvind Kejriwal, while addressing a public meeting in Janakpuri in West Delhi parliamentary constituency, said that Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was formed 70 years ago
 didie kendra sarkaar ke antargat he
 The dda's task was to make each family in Delhi a home in affordable and easy installments
 didie ne logon ko ghar banaakar dene ke bajaay sirf plot katkar bilderon ko diye
 DDA has become a den of corruption
 " arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne kaha tha ki dilli purna rajya banegi or das saal ke andar dilli ke prayek parivaar ko sasti or aasaan kishton par ghar banaakar degi
 Arvind Kejriwal had said that he has come fully prepared for this, that is why he has asked for ten years to fulfill this promise
 unhone kaha tha ki aisa hone par dilli main sabhi makaan maalik honge koi kiraayedaar nahin hoga
 Arvind Kejriwal had said that if Delhi gets full state status, there will be many such things which are not being done due to not being a full state
 kejariwal ne kaha tha ki pichley chunaav main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ramlila maidan kii raily main kaha tha ki sabhi saat seat bhaajapa ke khate main jane par dilli ko purna rajya bana diya jaayegaa
 He said that in this election we are now asking Modi that it has been five years, instead of fulfilling the promise of a full state, he has now turned away from this promise

 The police informs the mother of her daughter being raped and murdered
 maa nyaay ke liye ladati he
 Finally, after four years of waiting, the mother gets justice
 is naatak kaa sandesh rahaa ki hamen anyaay ke khilaaf mukhar hokar ladanaa chahie or kabhi peeche nahin hatana chahie
 The vote of thanks was given by Usha Vishwakarma and Rupa Pandey
 is dauraan kai panktiyon ne logon kaa dhyaan khinchaa
 For example
 
 
 
 Rape is a shame, but nowadays people do talk about religion in this as well
 
 
 
 What difference does it make whether she was Hindu, Christian or Muslim
 
 
 sabase pehle wo adamjaat insaan thi
 She came out in this society to make her dreams come true
 
 Wanted was a little respect
 
 But she was also surprised to see what happened to her

 India Vs Bangladesh: With India and Bangladesh running in the T20 series (IND vs BAN T20), today, Team India will clash with Bangladesh in Rajkot after losing in the Delhi T20
 dilli tii-20 kaa ek video viral (viral Video) ho rahaa he, jisamen sachin tendulkar (sachin Tendulkar) ke fain sudhir kumaar gautam (sudhir Kumar Gautam) ke saamne bangladeshi fain dahaad martha dikh rahaa he
 Sudhir is giving his answer in a unique way
 tiktaoc (tiktok) par ye video kaaphi viral ho rahaa he
 It can be seen in the video that a Bangladeshi fan comes close to Sudhir and Bangladesh starts raising slogans of Zindabaaz
 jis par sudhir 'bangladesh haaregaa' ke naare lagaate hai
 On which the Bangladeshi fan starts roaring like a lion, Sudhir starts staring at him
 ye video khub pasand kiya ja rahaa he
 Let me tell you, Sudhir comes to watch every match in the stadium to support Team India
 dilli main vaayu pradooshan ke baavjood pehla tii20 antarrashtriya match khelaa gaya tha jiske baad bisisiai adhyaksh saurav ganguli ne donon tiimon kaa aabhaar jataayaa tha
 Bangladesh beat India by seven wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the series
 yah nai dilli se patna jane vaali udaan isi-415 he, or baat 21 agast kii he
 Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav are the two stalwarts of Bihar politics in this flight
 achaanak vimaan main sugabugahaten hone lageen
 How will the two greet each other? Things were happening in a mutilated tongue
 jab lalu shaam saadhe chah baje vimaan main pahunche to bijness class kii 1e seat par baithe nitish kumaar ne 'neend' ke agosh main janaa behatar samajha
 The RJD chief also took a totally apathetic stance on Nitish and he was seen to be confused with the crew members regarding the quality of the seat
 koi 80 minute ke is safar ke dauraan donon aage vaali seat par baithe the lekin unke bich koi baat nahin hui
 Perhaps this indicates the depth of the tussle between the two
 aaj bihar ke chunavi paridrishy main isi tarah ke bhav pramukh rup se najar aa rahe hai
 Assembly elections are due in Bihar from October 21, in such a situation that Lalu Prasad, who has been in exile since November 2005, is making every effort to capture Pataliputra's power while a person remains his roadblock
 , And they are Nitish Kumar
 isi tarah, yah lalu or sirf lalu hi hai jo nitish ko ek baar phir satta sukh bhogane se vanchit rakh sakate hai
 Lalu is like a traffic cow, which can delay and overturn Nitish's vehicle
 isamen koi tajjub nahin ki unki dushmani ke koi niyam nahin hai
 Now, with elections being held at the head, Lalu and Nitish are embarking on making each other the thing of the past
 bihar main chunavi maahaul puri tarah garma chukaa hai
 While Nitish Kumar is saying, "people are dyeing their hair to hide their age", Lalu too fires up alleging that the Bihar Chief Minister is 'painting and painting' his face
 chunaavon ke dauraan jabaani mahayuddh main ek or vishay jo pramukhataa se rahane vaala he, vah he badlaav kaa
 5 in 243 assembly constituencies of the state
 44 karod se adhik matadaata hone se hi bihar vidhansabha ke prachand chunaav main vyaktitvon kaa muddon par haaavee rahanaa avashyambhavi he
 By the way, Bihar still suffers from chronic problems - the state is at the bottom in terms of per capita income, more than 55 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, the female-male ratio is much lower than the national average, per capita power consumption
 In this case too, the state is far behind
 iske alaava bhi kai samasyaayein maujuud hai
 Ironically, these elections are considered to be very important because this time a lot is at stake
 in chunaavon main nitish kumaar, lalu; or ram vilaas paswan apane raajnneetik jivan kii sabase mahatvapurn jang lard rahe hai
 Obviously, the loss of one will benefit the other
 agar lalu or paswan vaapasi karne main asafal rahe to unhen apni vidaai ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 If Nitish failed, he would be the latest and most ironic example of how he could not take advantage of a good start
 lalu or paswan saath kii umr paar kar chuke hai, isliye 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav unke liye rajg ko satta se ukhaad phenkane kaa sambhawatah sarvshereshth or aakhri mauka bhi hai
 Meanwhile, at the age of 59, Nitish Kumar is on the threshold of leaving his latest mark on the national map
 diggajon ko dhul chataane vaale ke rup main mashhoor nitish kumaar ko agar lagaataar doosraa mauka miltaa he to ve bade rashtriya netaaon kii qatari main aa jaaenge
 If they lose, they might not get a second chance
 lalu or paswan nitish ko satta virdohi lahar main bahaane ke liye din-raat mehnat kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, Nitish is constantly trying to break into the traditional vote bank of his political orthodoxy
 udhar, congress rahul gandhi ke sahare rajya main trikoniya mukaable banane kii jugat main juty he
 Interestingly, though Bihar elections are often fought on the strength of personal charisma, this time big personalities have decided not to contest elections
 nitish kumaar kah chuke hai ki unhen vidhansabha chunaav ladane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Similarly, RJD-LJP chief ministerial candidate Lalu Prasad seems unlikely to contest the election
 iske alaava, 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main lojpa kaa khaataa na khulne kaa dansh jhel rahe rajyasabha saansad ramvilas paswan or up-mukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi, jo rajya main jad(you)-bhaajapa gathbandhan kaayam rahane kii kunjee hai, bhi chunaav nahin ladenge
 This does not match the personality-based politics of Bihar
 lekin ranneetiyaan banane or prachaar karne kii dohari jimmedaariyaan unhen katai ek seat par dhyaan kendrit karne kii aazaadee nahin detii hai
 Two decades ago, Mandal Lehar brought Lalu to a strong position
 tab se rajd dhire-dhire hi sahi lekin nishchit taur par kabhi apane majboot rahe janaadhar ko pratidwandviyon ke haathon khota aayaa he
 Today, Lalu is trying to repeat the same history
 10 march, 1990 ko bihar ke mukhyamantri ke rup main apane pehle kaarykaal kii shuruyaat karne vaale lalu ek baar samay kii marubhumi main ulataa safar tay kar rahe hai
 Today, 20 years later, only this journey of the past can take them towards a bright future
 lalu samjhaute karne main bhi udaar rahe hai, jeet kii ummid se jhukate gaye hai
 He has also brought a staunch critic like Prabhunath Singh with him
 nitish virdohi voton ko katane se bachaane ke liye unhone paswan kii lok janashakti party (lojpa) ko 75 siten di hai
 He had to bear the brunt of not being with Paswan in the October 2005 Assembly elections
 haal hi main jab party main savarnon ke varisht netaa akhilesh singh congress kii ore adhik jhukate najar aae to lalu unke awaas par raatri bhoj par sambandhon ko durust karne ke liye pahunche
 He has also promised 10 percent reservation to economically weaker people among them to woo the upper castes
 ye vahi savarna hai jo 15 saal ke rajd ke shashan kaal ko ghrinaa se dekhte hai
 This time Lalu can also succeed in wooing the ethnic groups who are angry with Nitish's extreme affection for the backward classes and Mahadalits
 darasal, 90 ke dashak ke baad 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav pehla mauka hai jab bihar main 16 fisadi savarna vot kisi ginati main maane ja rahe hai
 This is because the backward class's base has been divided
 lalu or paswan donon hi musalamaanon, yadavon, daliton or mohabhang kaa shikaar hue savarnon ko lekar jaateey ganit bhidane main lage hue hai
 Lalu has always had a wonderful jugalbandi with his voters
 lekin ve jaanate hai ki jab tak jaateey ganit sahi nahin hoga tab tak is sab kaa koi phayda nahin hone vaala
 Apart from this, his focus is also on those few seats which RJD lost in 2005 with a very short interval
 is baar lalu bihar kaa cheharaa badalane kii baat bhi kar rahe hai
 They are promising that they will change Bihar in the same way as they have changed the Indian Railways
 lekin bihar ke mukhyamantri ke taur par unke record ko dekhakar, unki is baat ke kuch zyada kadradaan milane vaale nahin lagate
 Apart from this, it is becoming difficult for the RJD chief to find a cut of the 'image' of the Chief Minister who gave the result of Nitish
 nitish kumaar bhi is baat se waakif hai ki unka 'khaas prabhaav' loksabhaa chunaav, jinamein rajg ko 40 main se 32 siten mili thim, ke baad kuch gata he
 At that time, JD (U) and BJP candidates had led in 176 of the 243 assembly seats in the state, while RJD could lead in only 33 seats
 vaise, sitambar 2009 main 18 vidhansabha siton par hue upachunaavon main 13 siton main rajg kii haar hui thi
 But there are still many arrows left in Nitish's quiver
 unhone dohari ranneeti par kaam kiya
 He carried out the development keeping in mind the social welfare of marginal groups
 apane puure kaarykaal ke dauraan ve bahut hi sayaanepan se nayaa saamaajik aadhaar taiyaar karte rahe
 They formed new caste and community based alliances separate from traditional social groups
 nitish ab apane phaayde ke liye 'vipareet guton ke gathbandhan' ko bhunaa rahe hai, jisamen savarna se lekar atyadhik pichde or mahadalit tak shaamil hai
 His image of a struggling secular and his steps taken into consideration for minorities has given him a new base of support
 ab jab chunaav sir par hai, nitish ke liye sab kuch ekadam aasaan nahin he
 Nitish, who is carrying out campaigning like the presidential election, has made some new friends, but in the process, some trusted friends have also been lost
 unke sabase vishwaasapaatr sipahasaalar prabhunath singh or lalan singh virdohi kheme main hai
 Nitish's acceptance rate in the state is still high
 phir bhi nitish ke liye ek khatra maujuud he
 The high-profile publicity of his achievements does not match the ground reality at all
 isse ve 'bihar udai' ke jaal main aasaani se funs sakate hai
 High praise for his rule can also shock his image
 unki pareshaaniyaan yaheen khatm nahin ho jaatin
 Some elements of his ally saffron party have been voicing silent opposition to Nitish's aggressive secularism
 ye shaayad bhaajapa ke kor kader ko rajg ke prati waisi siton par udasin kar saktaa he, jahaan jad (you) ke pratyaashee khadey hon
 The verdict on Ayodhya — which is likely to come this month — whatever it may be, the BJP may try to cash it in front of its original voters, but it could have an opposite effect on its alliance with the JD (U) and Nitish on this issue
 But Kauai may refuse to take a stand
 darasal, gathbandhan main taaja daraar somvaar ko tab najar ai jab jad (you) netaaon ne bhaajapa ke saath sabhi sambandhon ko khatm karne kii maang kar daali
 He demanded this on the statement of BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi that Narendra Modi will campaign in Bihar
 lekin ab donon hi partiyaan is maamle ko rafa-dfa karne kaa prayaas karti dikh rahi hai kyonki gathbandhan main kisi bhi tarah kii foot ko ujagar karne kaa yah sahi samay nahin he
 If nothing else, at least once again there is a hint that BJP is playing the role of Nitish's ally in Bihar
 ek aisi party jo karnataka, madhya prades, gujarat, chhattisgarh, himachal pradesh or jharkhand main satta main he, vah party bihar main maatahat party ban kar rah gai he
 It is also believed that the central leadership has lost many allies in the past and does not want to lose the Bihar Chief Minister as an ally
 yah gathbandhan us samay ekadam tuutane ke kagaar par pahunch gaya tha jab is saal june maah main nitish ne narendra modi or bhaajapa rashtriya kaaryakarini ke netaaon ke liye raatri bhoj ko radd kar diya tha or gujarat dwaara bihar ko bheji gai baadh raahat saamagree bhi lautaa di thi
 But BJP is still bowing before them
 nitish ke liye prakritik aapadaaon se upji pareshaaniyon-sookhaa or baadh-ke alaava unki kuch ekadam spasht asafalataaen bhi hai jo ek jatke main ujagar ho jaati hai
 The number of people living below the poverty line is very high, the state is dependent on the Center for electricity, has not been able to take much shape even in the name of industrialization and the pain of unemployment still hurts people
 unki museebaton main ijapha maovadiyon dwaara haal hi main apahrit chaar pulicekarmiyon kii vajah se hua he, jiske chalate kanoon-vyavastha ke kshetra main rajya kii safalataa kii daastaan par grahan lag gaya
 On the other hand, the Congress is hoping for a hung assembly
 uskaa lakshya 10 siton ke apane maujuuda aankade main chaar guna kii vruddhi karne kaa; he taaki vah kuch bada ulatpher kar sake
 This is a kind of litmus test for Rahul Gandhi in Bihar
 aakhirkaar, yah chunavi jang nitish viruddh lalu hone ja rahi he
 Nitish's social surgery will compete with lalu-paswan's vote base
 donon netaaon ke paas paraspar virdohi hunar or gathbandhan hai, lekin ve ek jaise darshan or ek jaisi mahatvakanksha se prerit hai
 However, the two people cannot dream together in the goal they are dreaming of
