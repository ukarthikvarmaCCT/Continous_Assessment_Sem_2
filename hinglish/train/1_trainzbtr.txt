 He alleged that the two businessmen who had raided the Income Tax Department had direct links with Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, which is why Chauhan was not even ready to discuss corruption in defense of both the businessmen
 vidhansabha parisar main samvaadadaataaon se charchaa karte hue singh ne kaha ki vipaksh rajya main badhate bhrashtachar par vidhansabha main charchaa karana chahta tha, iske liye kaary sthagan prastaav bhi die gaye, magar sarkaar isse bachati rahi or jab virodh jataayaa gaya to do congress vidhayakon kii sadsyta hi khatm kar di gai
 This is an attempt to suppress the voice of the opposition
 singh ne kaha ki kal tak lagata tha ki jin do kaarobaariyon ke yahaan iskar vibhaag ke chaape pade hai, unhen vidhayakon va sarkaar ke mantriyon kaa hi samarthan hasil tha, lekin bhrashtachar par charchaa na karaae jane se pramanit ho gaya he ki inase mukhyamantri chouhan kaa sidhaa naata he

 ’ Death of farmers is common today
 kahin aatmahatya to kahin sadamein se kisaan mar rahe hai
 The All India Kisan Sangharsh Samiti submitted a memorandum to the President on 31st of last month and demanded that a special session should be called to hear the problems of the farmers
 jaisaa kii aaj ke raajnneetik maahaul main hona tha, vahi hua
 There was no further discussion on this issue
 kisaan sangharsh samiti ke binar tale jo log raashtrapati se milane pahunche the unamem maharashtra ke varisht netaa or vidhayak vidhayak raju sethi bhi shaamil the
 He said to His Excellency we should call a special session to listen to the problems of the farmers
 unhone kaha hamane tark rakhaa ki jab jiesti ko lekar aadhi raat ko vishesh satr bulaayaa ja saktaa he to phir kisaanon ke liye kyon nahin bulaayaa ja saktaa?lekin mahamahim ko saunpe gaye gyaapan main ek baat or likhi thi jiskaa zikr is samay zyada jaruri he
 That is, after the death of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Mandarwa village of Basti district on 11 December 2003, a special session of Parliament was called to discuss the crisis of agriculture and farmers
 darasal jab kal jab murali manohar joshi philhal aswasth chal rahe atal bihari vaajapeyi ko dekhakar laute to unhone ek baat kahi, '' shaayad prakruti ne unhen isliye chup kara diya he kyonki aaj kii raajnneetik paristhiti ko dekhte hue vah kya kehete? atal ji kaa apni baat kehane kaa alag andaaj tha
 He had the ability to say the biggest thing easily
 ''unhone yah baat patrakaron ke atal ji kii sehat ke bare main puche jane par kahi
 Murali Manohar Joshi said that Atal ji's immunity has reduced drastically
 isliye unase kisi ko milane nahin diya ja rahaa he
 They can be seen through the window in the hospital room door
 murali manohar joshi kaa dukh jaij he, kyonki jab rahul gandhi 6 june ko mandsaur golicond main maare gaye kisaanon ko shrridhanjali dene pahunche to ise ek siyaasi tabake ne raajnneeti qaraar diya
 And remember how in 1998, veteran Congress leader and then state Chief Minister Digvijay Singh opened fire on soybean farmers
 digvijay raaj ho yaa shiv 'raaj' kisaanon ke hisse haq nahin goliyaan hi aati hai
 This comment of Murali Manohar Joshi definitely raises a question, would Atal Bihari Vajpayee be able to say very eloquent and easy to say serious things easily, if he was healthy today? *** AIADMK ke purv up mahasachiv or shashikala ke bhattije titivi dinakaran ko tees hajri court ne paanch din ke liye police remand par bhej diya he

 ) 1 july kii subah
 Saturday desh ke kaarobaar main kaali kamai karne vaale vyapaariyon kii shani kii mahadasha kii shuruyaat
 From July 1, black businesses are beginning to close in the country
 jiesti launch hote hi kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkaron ko adhik rajasav milane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 The last warning has been issued to the people doing black business in the country by playing the hour of GST in the Central Hall of Parliament
 chetavanee main kaha gaya he ki ab desh main kaala kaarobaar kar sarkaar ke rajasav kii chori karne waalon kii khayr nahin he
 In fact, during the GST launch in Parliament, it was told that only 85 lakh businessmen pay tax in the country
 yani 125 karod kii aabaadi vaale is desh main 1 fisadi se bhi kam log kaarobaar par tex dete hai
 This is because India is a country where people are notorious worldwide for saving tax, hiding and stealing
 desh main tex chori or kaale kaarobaar ke chalate antarrashtriya manch par bharat kii sovrain reating behad kam he
 Due to this, where foreign investors are reluctant to turn to India, programs like Make in India await big investment
 gauratlab he ki credit reating agencia duniyabar ke deshon kii aarthik or raajnneetik sthit ke aadhaar par use credit reating detii hai
 Global investors are prepared to invest in a country based on this rating
 2017 ke aankadon ke mutabik maujuuda samay main badi arthvyavasthaaon or achche nivesh thikaanon kii suchi main bharat kii sthiti yah chart bayaan karti he
 How will the black market stop with GST? The most important thing about the provision of GST applicable in India is that the digitization of business is being done here
 ise prabhavi dhang se karne ke liye jiesti main tex credit vyavastha banaai gai he
 Under this, the businessman has to upload the invoice of his product or service on the GST portal every month
 is invais ko kaarobaariyon ke saplir or vendor ke aankadon se milaane kaa kaam jiesti network main laga software karegaa
 And if this match is found correct, the business will get the benefit of tax credit
 is niyam ke chalate desh main kaarobaariyon ko kaale kaarobaar se baahar nikalne ke liye sirf registerd saplir or vendor kaa sahaara lenaa hoga
 These suppliers and vendors will also be registered and will be under GST if the turnover exceeds Rs 20 lakh

 9 Former England fast bowler Darren Gough feels that the Indian pace attack has enough power to fill the gap of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah in the Test series starting on August 1
 gow ne kaha ki bhubaneshwar (pehle teen test) or bumraah (pehla test) kii gairmaujuudagi main bhi captain viraat kohli ke paas tej or spin gendbaaji vibhaag main kai vikalp maujuud hai, jo kisi bhi pich par prabhavi gendbaaji kar sakate hai
 Gau said, "bhuvneshwar's absence in the team is a big loss and he was not in rhythm in the ODI series due to injury
 bhartiya team ab waisi team nahin he jo ek yaa do gendbaajon par nirbhar rahe
 Earlier he relied heavily on Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath and Zaheer Khan, but now this is not the case and he is ready for the Test series
 ’coach bole- badal gaya viraat, 4 saal puraani naakaami usne bhula digau ne kaha, ‘aap gharelu maidan par khel rahe hon yaa baahar aaj ke daur main aapako bharat ko haraane ke liye apane khel ke sheersh par rahanaa hoga kyonki unki gendbaaji main sabakuch maujuud hai
 Bhuvneshwar has a swing, Bumrah skids the ball
 'unhone kaha, 'umesh yadav ke paas gati ke saath gend ko move karaane kii kshamta he, mohammad shami majboot hai or jor laga kar gend ko pich par tappa dilaate hai or eshanth sharma anbhavi or aakraamak hai, jo lambii spel daal sakate hai
 Gau said that the Indian spin attack has been strengthened by the arrival of Kuldeep Yadav
 unhone kaha, ‘in sab se upar aapke paas teen shandaar spinner hai
 He said, "ravichandran Ashwin is almost impossible to play on Indian pitches, Ravindra Jadeja keeps picking wickets continuously and Kuldeep Yadav has proved himself in England
" team kaa chayan aasaan nahin hoga, bhartiya team prabandhan ko meri shubhakamanaayen kyonki kisi naa kisi ko naaraaz hona hoga
 The English cricketer wants to take inspiration from Kohli in the Test series, even though questions have been raised on the selection of spin bowlers Adil Rashid and Moin Ali in the England team, but they had no option
 gow ne kaha, ‘test team main uskaa (raashid) chayan nahin hona chahie kyonki usne lambey praaroop main khelnaa chhod diya tha
 i was disappointed when he left Yorkshire in the middle of the season at the start of the domestic season
 'unhone kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki agar usne laal gend se thodi zyada mehnat kii hoti to vah england kii test team kaa niyamit sadsy hota
 There is no doubt that he is England's best spinner
 lekin main usase (pratham shrenee cricket ke prati ravaiye se) niraash hum

 The Lokayukta of Uttar Pradesh has suggested the state government to bring the Chief Minister under its ambit to strengthen the Lokayukta organization
 lokayukta nyaayamurti en ke mehrotra ne kaha, ‘pradesh sarkaar ne lokayukta sanghathan ko majboot karne or bahusadasyeey banane ke liye suzav maange the, jiske baad use sanghathan ko majboot karne ke bare main suzav diye gayi hai
 He said that it has been suggested to the state government that the Chief Minister and the village head should also be brought under the purview of Lokayukta, as is the case in states like Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh
 nyaayamurti mehrotra ne kaha, ‘yah kisi vyakti kaa maamla nahin he balki siddhant or pad kii baat he
 The government should consider bringing the Chief Minister under the purview of Lokayukta
 ’ unhone bataaya ki pradesh sarkaar ko yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki lokayukta sanghathan ko or adhik prabhavi banane ke liye vishvavidhyalayon, shaikshanik sansthaanon, nyaason, samitiyon or gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ko bhi iske jaanch daayre main laayaa janaa chaiye
 These organizations have already been kept under the scrutiny of the Lokayukta in many states
 mehrotra ne bataaya ki pradesh sarkaar ko yah vyavastha karne kaa bhi suzav diya gaya he ki sabhi janpratinidhi lokayukta ko salanaa apni sampatti kaa vyora prastut karen taaki aay se adhik sampatti hone kii ashanka hone par lokayukta swat: maamle kaa sangyaan lekar jaanch kar saken
 He said that it has also been suggested to implement the recommendations made in the investigation report in a time bound manner and to allow prosecution if necessary within three months
 lokayukta ne bataaya ki sanghathan ko or takat dene ke liye kisi jaanch agency ko bhi iske adhikaar kshetra main rakhaa janaa chaiye or ise mukademe chalaane kaa adhikaar milanaa chaiye
 He said that even though the Lokayukta organization is still a multi-member organization
 magar yah suzav bhi diya gaya he ki ise bahusadasyeey nirnay dene kaa adhikaar bhi milanaa chaiye
 The Lokayukta clarified that all these things are part of the suggestion sent to him on the demand of the state government and are only at the level of dialogue between the organization and the government, which the state government is free to decide

 is sabase musalamaanon kaa haal sabase bura he, wo is baat se dare hai ki kahin isse phayda bijepi ko naa ho jaae or phacist takaton ko phayda naa ho jaae
 Earlier on Sunday, Komalayam Singh stated in a press conference that i am still the president of Samajwadi Party and Shivpal Yadav is the UP president of SP
 iske saath hi unhone kaha ki ramgopal yadav party se baahar kiye ja chuke hai, aise main unhen adhiveshan bulaane kaa koi adhikaar nahin
 There is news from sources that Amar Singh has offered to resign from the party in front of Mulayam Singh
 vahiin uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri or varisht congressi leader endi tiwari ne mulaayam singh yadav ko chitthee likhakar kaha he ki akhilesh ko raajnneetik viraasat saunp den

 Mulayam did not say anything against Akhilesh, yes it definitely said that roads have developed in many places, so PWD minister Shivpal Yadav has also contributed to that
 kuch is tarah mulaayam ne shivpal kii tarif kar di
 At that time Shivpal was sitting together
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne muslim samaaj main teen talaak ke mudde par kaha he ki unhen is maamle main bharat kii parampara par puraa bharosa he
 He said that the people of Muslim society should themselves come forward against this fight and this issue should not be politicized
 piem modi visweshwar jayanti ke uplakshya main vigyaan bhawan main yojit ek kaarykram ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Remembering Lord Vasveshwar, PM Modi said that he gave women from every section of society the right to express their views
 samaaj ke har varg se ai mahilaayein apane vichaar vyakt karti thim
 There were also many women who were considered disparaged under the evils prevailing in the society at that time, but the same women also had the right to speak at the Anubhav Mandap
 mahila shashaktikaran ko lekar us daur main ye kitna bada prayaas tha ham andaaj laga sakate hai, hamaare desh kii visheshta rahi he ki buraaiyaan ai hai lekin unke khilaaf ladane kaa madda bhi hamaare bheetar hi paidaa hua he
 PM Modi said that the time when Raja Rammohan Roy would have talked about widow marriage, how much society would have criticized him, but he was adamant that this is a gross injustice to mothers and sisters
 Sometimes i think that such a big debate is going on today regarding triple talaq, but in view of the great tradition of India, there is a feeling of hope in my mind that in this country powerful people come from within the society
 Lates that break irrelevant traditions develop modern systems
 muslim samaaj se bhi aise prabud log paidaa honge, aage aaenge or muslim samaaj kii betiyon par jo guzar rahi he, jo biit rahi he uske khilaaf wo khud ladaai ladenge or kabhi na kabhi khud rasta nikaalenge
 Modi said that there will be enlightened Muslims from India who will have the power to show the way to the Muslims of the world
 is dharti kii ye takat he
 It is the strength of the soil of India that people of the same society will come forward to save the women of Muslim society who are facing the problem of triple talaq and i will also appeal to the people of Muslim society not to allow this issue in politics
 aap aage aaie or samasya kaa samaadhaan kiijie
 The joy of that solution will be something else, the coming generations will get strength from it
 piem ne kaha ki har kisi kaa sammaan ho, jati pratha, chuaachhut jaisi buraaiyaan na hon, sabko barabari kaa avasar mili yahi bhagwaan visweshwar chaahate the
 He saw God in every human
 unhone kaha tha ki ye sharir ek mandir he jisamen aatma hi bhagwaan he
 The principle of high-end discrimination in society, respect for labor, empowerment of every person is a strong foundation for any society and democracy
 piem ne kaha ki bhagwaan visweshwar kehete the ki ye mat pucho ki aadmi kis jati or mat kaa he, bas ye kaho ki ye hamaara he
 There is one among us
 isi neenv par ek majboot raashtra kaa nirmaan hota he
 These principles serve as the directive for the nation
 piem modine kaha ki bharat kii dharti par 800 saal pahal in vichaaron ko bhagwaan basaweshwar ne aadhaar banaaya tha, is sarkaar ke sabakaa saath-sabakaa vikaas ke mantra main bhi vahi pratidhwani he
 Every person of this country should have his own house without discrimination
 har kisi ko 24 ghante bijli milani chahie

 Whether it is the ruling party or the opposition parties, both are releasing controversial photos against each other and doing politics
 isi kram main shuukravaar ko jediu ne patrkaar sammelan main ek photo jari kii, jisamen purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ek ladki ke saath najar aa rahe hai
 Questioning this picture, JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh said that Kiteshvisi used to consume Yadvashrab and posed with girls
 sanjay singh ne kaha ki argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav or tejasvi yadav ko nitish kumaar par hamalaa karne se pehle apane ghar main jhaankna chahie
 Tejashwi immediately responded to the attack on Tejashwi by JDU spokesman Sanjay Singh
 ek taraf jahaan tejasvi ne kabool kiya ki vah isaldki ke saath photomein najar aa rahe hai, magar is ladki ko pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya
 Tejashwi also attacked Nitish and asked the question in gestures that when Nitish Kumar goes to Delhi, what does he go to do in Palam Vihar and Dwarka keeping his belongings in Bihar residence? Tejashwi asked the question related to Nitish Kumar, in whose name did he start the Archana Express and Upasana Express trains when he was the Railway Minister? However, Bihar's Dirty Picture Politics became more dirty at that time in rjd's press conference MLA and spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav released a picture in which JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh's son is seen with a girl
 gauratlab he ki, dasvin ke dwaara nitish kumaar par nijee hamale kaa jawaab dete hue jediu pravaktaa niraj kumaar ne kaha ki agar nitish ne trainon kaa naam archana express or upasna express rakhaa to isamen galat kya he? lalu prasad par tanj kasate hue niraj kumaar ne sawaal uthaaya ki agar in trainon kaa naam archana express or upasna express nahin hota to kya bhrashtachar express or sajayaftaa express hona chahie? All eyes were set on the new Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala at the swearing-in ceremony held at the Haryana Raj Bhavan on October 27
 is chunaav main 31 varshiya yah jat netaa sabake liye ek chaunkaane vaala cheharaa tha
 His 10-month-old party Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) won 10 seats in one stroke in the 90-member assembly
 devilal ke padpote, om prakaash chautaala ke pote or ajay chautaala ke is putr ne bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane kaa faisla kiya or mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ke bagal main khadey hokar upmukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee
 In his short political career — Dushyant won the Lok Sabha election at the age of 26 in 2014 and made his name in the record book as the youngest MP — this descendant of the Chautala family projected his image as the 'first gentleman Chautala' Which is in complete contrast to the image of his dynasty with domineering politicians
 public skool main padhe, angreji bhashi dushyant haryana main jat netritv kaa nayaa cheharaa hai
 They talk of moving away from the caste-centric politics of elders in the family and taking all the 36 fraternities together
 haalanki mukhya rup se kheti karne vaali is jati kii kul aabaadi main hissedari kareeb 26 pratishat he or jejepi ke kul 15 pratishat voton main sabase zyada yahi hai
 JJP has 5 out of 10 mlas
 bhaajapa ko bahumat se chah siten or congress ko bahumat se 15 siten kam milane se donon hi partiyaan dushyant ko apni taraf khinchne kii koshish kar rahe the
 But the next day when he went to meet his father Ajay Chautala and grandfather Om Prakash Chautala who were lodged in Tihar Jail on the charge of recruitment of teachers, Ajay Chautala advised them not to go with Bhupinder Singh Hooda because doing so for him The opportunity to strengthen their hold in the Jats will be eroded
 is baar jaaton main khatter virdohi bhaawanaaon kaa sabase zyada laabh hooda ko hi mila tha
 But Hooda is still embroiled in ED and CBI investigations
 centre for study of develping societes main professor abhaya dube kehete hai, ''hooda jitne kamjor rahenge, dushyant ko utana hi zyada phayda milegaa
 Apart from this, they will also have the benefit of being young
 '' duusari taraf bhaajapa ne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne se pehle dushyant kaa intjaar karne kaa faisla kiya, jabaki use saat nirdaleey vidhayakon, indian neshnal lok dal ke abhaya chautaala or haryana lokhit party ke gopal goyal kanda kaa samarthan mil chukaa tha
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah was keen to get the support of Dushyant (though a section of people in the BJP did not agree with it) as it would have helped the party gain access to the isolated Jat fraternity
 bhaajapa ne dushyant ke saath baatcheet ke do raste khol die the—punjab ke purv mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ne 24 aktubar kii dopaher ko unase sampark kiya tha, baad main vitt rajyamantri anuraag thakur ne amit shah kii ore se unase baatcheet kii
 After meeting his father, Dushyant called Thakur and explained his conditions: the post of deputy chief minister and the cabinet and minister of state for two mlas
 samjhauta tay ho gaya
 Then Thakur and Dushyant went to Amit Shah's residence to formalize the deal
 bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan karke dushyant ne bhale kii raajnneetik jokhim uthaaya he lekin unke liye yah koi nayaa jokhim nahin he
 His decision to contest from Uncha Kalan was also very risky

 gujarat main board kii parikshaon main bacchon ko dabaav se bachaane ke liye kai kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 The 10th and 12th board examinations started on Wednesday
 is saal gujarat main 12 lakh se zyada vidhyaarthee yah pariksha de rahe hai
 On the first day of the examination, the school staff welcomed the children to the examination centers by offering tilak, flowers and offering
 har skool main parikshaon main bacchon ko tanaav mukt karne kii koshish dikhi
 Every year, many children take the wrong step due to fear of examination or not being able to perform well in the examination
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhkar yah kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 The comments pariksha ke dauraan bacchon par zyada dabaav na banaaya jaae, ise lekar abhibhavakon main bhi jagriti aa rahi he
 One father, Dr
 Mehul Mashkariya, said that he is seeing in the society that children are being put under tremendous pressure
 aisa lagata he jaise yah jivan kii antim pariksha he
 By putting pressure on children to top, there is a disadvantage of children rather than benefits
 aisa bahut baar hamane dekha he
 Therefore, after hard work, children should now create an atmosphere to give exams with a free mind
 bacchon par dabaav na ho, board kii pariksha bhi anya parikshaon kii tarah hi bacchon ke liye aasaan gujaren iske liye kai sansthaaen bhi vishesh kaam kar rahi hai
 The head of one such organization, Oasis, Dr
 Maya Soni, said that he was a little worried about the recent environment
 ve bacchon ko samajhaana chaahati hai ki jindagi main or bahut saare avasar milane vaale hai
 Even if we are not able to do very well in this examination, much more has to happen in life
 shaayad in koshishon kaa hi nateeja he ki is saal pariksha se pehle koi durghatana nahin hui he
 During the examination, there should be no pressure on the children, parents are also awakened
 ek pita dow mehul mashkaaria ne kaha ki ve samaaj main dekh rahe hai ki bacchon par beintahaa dabaav daalaa ja rahaa he
 It seems like this is the ultimate test of life
 top karne ke liye bacchon par dabaav daalane se phaayde ke bajaay bacchon kaa nuksaan hota he
 We have seen this many times
 isliye mehnat ke baad ab bacchon ko mukt man se pariksha dene kaa maahaul bananaa chahie
 There is no pressure on the children, like many other examinations of the board, it is easy for the children to pass easily
 aisi hi ek sanstha oysis kii pramukh dow maaya soni ne bataaya ki haal ke maahaul se unhen thodi chintaa he
 She wants to convince the children that there are going to be many more opportunities in life
 is pariksha main ham bahut acha nahin kar paaen to bhi or bahut kuch jindagi main hona he
 Perhaps the result of these efforts is that there have been no accidents before the examination this year
 bacchon par dabaav na ho, board kii pariksha bhi anya parikshaon kii tarah hi bacchon ke liye aasaan gujaren iske liye kai sansthaaen bhi vishesh kaam kar rahi hai

 All agencies are working on a plan
 " According to information received by NDTV India, in this high level meeting, it was concluded that all the airports in India are sensitive in terms of security
 sabase zyada khatra un raaston se he jo shahar kii ore se hawaii addon kii ore jate hai
 From there, explosives can be easily transported to the airport or even fidayeen can reach the entry gate
 isiilie faisla liya gaya ki shahar se airporton tak jane vaale raaston par random checking badhaai jaae
 The second threat to airports is from the cargo side
 iske liye faisla hua ki petroling cargo aria bhi badhaayaa jaae
 Apart from this, it has been decided that the criteria set by the Home Ministry will be adopted by the states

 It was also decided to deploy armored vehicles outside the airports
 tippaniyan National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said that since the Ministry of Home Affairs has the authority to conduct security audits, the review should be done by the Ministry itself and not the BCAS
 unke mutabik har airport kii samvedansheeltaa kaa akalan kiya janaa chahie or iske liye team ko khud samiksha ke liye sabhi hawaii addon par janaa chahie
 He said that "the sensitivity of every airport should be classified
 " The biggest concern in the meeting was raised about the buildings around the airports
 dobhaal kaa kahana tha ki agar BCAS in imaaraton kii suraksha kaa akalan nahin kar saktaa to phir yah akalan grih mantralay ko karnaa chahie
 Civil Aviation Secretary Rajeev Nayan Choubey suggested that behavior monitoring mechanisms and profiling of passengers is also necessary

 " enditivi india ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik is ucch stareey baithak main yah nateeja niklaa ki bharat main jitne bhi hawaii adde hai ve suraksha kii drushti se samvedansheel hai
 The biggest danger is from the routes that go from the city to the airports
 vahaan se visphotak aasaani se hawaii adde tak pahunchaae ja sakate hai yaa phir fidaayin bhi entry get tak pahunch sakate hai
 That is why it was decided to increase random checking on the routes from the city to the airports
 hawaii addon ko doosraa khatra cargo said kii taraf se he
 For this, it was decided that the patrolling cargo area should also be increased
 iske alaava tay kiya gaya ki jo maapdand grih mantralay ne tay kiye hai unhen rajyon ko apnaanaa hoga

 tippaniyan National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said that since the Ministry of Home Affairs has the authority to conduct security audits, the review should be done by the Ministry itself and not the BCAS
 unke mutabik har airport kii samvedansheeltaa kaa akalan kiya janaa chahie or iske liye team ko khud samiksha ke liye sabhi hawaii addon par janaa chahie
 He said that "the sensitivity of every airport should be classified
 " The biggest concern in the meeting was raised about the buildings around the airports
 dobhaal kaa kahana tha ki agar BCAS in imaaraton kii suraksha kaa akalan nahin kar saktaa to phir yah akalan grih mantralay ko karnaa chahie
 Civil Aviation Secretary Rajeev Nayan Choubey suggested that behavior monitoring mechanisms and profiling of passengers is also necessary
 baithak main faisla hua ki jald hi desh ke 98 airporton par siaisef kii tainaati kii jaaegi
 Currently, 59 of the 98 airports are with the CISF and the remaining 39 are under other security forces
 grih mantralay ke mutabik 98 main se 26 behad samvedansheel hai
 Airports in Delhi and Mumbai fall under the hyper sensitive category
 adhik samvedansheel 26 hawaii addon main se 18 main siaisef kii tainaati he
 In Srinagar and Imphal (central Reserve Police Force), the CRPF undertakes security
 sensitive category main 58 hawaii adde hai
 Of these, CISF protects
 teesri shrenee ke 16 hawaii addon main se chaar siaisef ke adheen hai
 According to CISF DG Surendra Singh, security of airports is of paramount importance
 suraksha kavach ko or zyada pukhta banane ke liye counter insargency ke maikenism ko pukhta karne kii jarurat he
 The DG also says that airports should also have side lanes so that if a vehicle is suspected, it can be taken and checked there
 baithak main yatriyon ke saamaan ko scan karne ke liye hitech system lagane kaa faisla bhi hua
 It was also decided to deploy armored vehicles outside the airports
 tippaniyan National Security Advisor Ajit Doval said that since the Ministry of Home Affairs has the authority to conduct security audits, the review should be done by the Ministry itself and not the BCAS

 Civil Aviation Secretary Rajeev Nayan Choubey suggested that behavior monitoring mechanisms and profiling of passengers is also necessary
 siaisef ke diji surendra singh ke mutabik hawaii addon kii suraksha sabase ahm he
 To make the security shield more robust, the mechanism of counter-emergency needs to be strengthened
 diji kaa yah bhi kahana he ki hawaii addon ke paas said len bhi honi chahie taaki agar kisi gaadi par andeh ho to vahaan le jaakar uski checking kii ja sake
 In the meeting, it was also decided to install hi-tech system to scan the luggage of the passengers
 airporton ke baahar bakhtarband gadiyon ko tainaat karne kaa nirnay bhi liya gaya
 The comments rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal kaa kahana tha ki chunki grih mantralay ke paas suraksha audit karne kaa adhikaar he isliye samiksha bhi mantralay ko hi kerani chahie na ki BCAS ko
 According to him, the sensitivity of each airport should be assessed and for this the team itself should visit all the airports for review
 unhone kaha ki "har airport kii samvedansheeltaa clacyphid kii jaani chahie
 " baithak main sabase zyada chintaa airporton ke aasapaas kii imaaraton ko lekar jataai gai
 Doval said that if the BCAS cannot assess the security of these buildings, then the Ministry of Home Affairs should do this assessment
 civil aviation secreteri rajeev nayan choube kaa suzav tha ki bihaviour monitoring maikenism or yatriyon kii profiling karnaa bhi jaruri he

 rahul ne kaha ki is press conference main jetali kii beti kaa acount number saaf bataaya gaya jisamen paise aae
 But large sections of the media did not show this news
 rahul gandhi ne media kii tulana sena ke jawan se karte hue kaha ki jis tarah sena ke jawan seemaa par desh kii raksha karte hai, usee tarah press seemaa ke andar sachai kii raksha karti he
 But in the case of Arun Jaitley, the press did not defend the truth

 In this game there is an advantage from the perspective of studies and writing, there is also the benefit of money

 yah twit ek poster ke taur par kiya gaya he jisamen mayawati ke photo ke saath massej likhaa hua he

 In such a situation, how can he be a supporter of Mayawati
 2019 ke chunaav ke baad mayawati ke paas sapa ke saath gathbandhan kaa afsos karne ke alaava kuch nahin hoga

 pehali baar suraksha balon ne use pakadana chaha, lekin pusht khufia jaankaree ke baavjood dakshin kashmir ke kokernag sthit gaanv ke makaan main vah aatankwaadi ko khoj nahin sake
 According to the information, the officer and the entire team leading the operation entered the house twice but they could not find the terrorist hiding in a special place in the roof
 teesri baar talaashi ke dauraan aatankwaadiyon ne javaanon par golibari kar khud hi apana raaj fash kar diya
 Only after this, three people including Wani were killed in an encounter with the security forces and later there were months of unrest in the valley
 maanviya or takneekee khufia soochnaaon ke baavjood jab suraksha bal kisi makaan main aatankwaadi ko khoj nahin pate hai to unhen ugr pratirodhi bheed kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Sources said, after seeing these conditions, the need for radar capable of looking inside the walls was felt which would help the security forces in counter-insurgency operations, especially in the crowded areas

 In Vadodara, popularly known as Sanskari Nagri, there has been a string of incidents involving the relationship between a teacher and a disciple, in which the student studying tuition was sexually assaulted by giving him a higher mark
 vadodara ke manjalpur ilaake main privet tution class teacher vinu kataaria apni chaatra ko biology kaa tution detaa tha
 For almost a year, the teacher harassed the victim by accusing them of getting good marks
 itnaa hi nahin magar vinu kataaria ne chaatra kaa video viral karne kii bhi dhamkee di thi
 Finally, after the victim told her family about this act of the Guru, the ground slipped under the feet of the family
 peeditake pita ne kaha, 'jab meri beti ne shikshak kii harakat ke bare main bataaya to hamen kaaphi dhakka laga
 He constantly sexually abused them by asking for good marks
 'jaise hi shikshak par chaatra kii ore se balaatkaar kiye jane kii baat kaa khulaasa hua to aanan-fanan main vadodara police ne kasuurvaar shikshak ko dhar dabocha or usase kadi poochtacha shuru kar di gai
 The accused teacher is also working as a teacher in the renowned school of Vadodara
 police ne puure maamle kii tah tak jane kaa faisla kiya he, police ab yah bhi jaanch kar rahi he ki is ladki ke alaava or bhi duusari ladakiyon ko achche marks kaa laalach dekar unke saath yon shoshan to nahin kiya gaya

 is bich, madhya pradesh ke grahamantri ne chaunkaane vaala bayaan diya he
 Home Minister Umashankar Gupta said that the incident is unfortunate, it has embarrassed the state and the country
 videshi shailani bhraman ke liye aate hai, lekin ve jile me bhraman ke dauraan soochna nahin dete hai, jiske chalate yah ghatnaayen ho rahi hai
 The question is, if the tourists also take police protection, then what is the meaning of the excursion? It should not be that the security should be so circumspect that the native or foreign tourists can come and go freely anytime, anywhere
 rajya mahila ayog kii adhyaksh bhi videshi mahila se gangrape kii ghinauni vaardaat par aansu to bahaati hai, lekin ant main yah bataanaa nahin bhuulatin ki rajya main mahila aparaadh kii dar main kami ai he
 Madhya Pradesh Women's Commission Chairman Upma Rai said that the act that has happened to a woman from Switzerland is a shame
 mahila aparaadhon kii dar main kami hui he, jo ki 60 fisadi he
 The incident of gang rape of a Swiss woman in Datia is the second incident of recent rape of a foreign woman in Madhya Pradesh
 gauratlab he ki datia main swiss mahila se chaar haivaanon dwaara dushkarm kiye jane ke pehle bandhavgarh main bhi ek videshi mahila ke saath hotel main balaatkaar hua tha
 Apparently, the anger of the people is increasing on the plight of Madhya Pradesh
 book:saint of e gemelekhak:raghav chandrapablisher:roopa publicationskimat:500 rupeis kitaab kii samiksha padhane se pehle aapke liye ek tathy kaa jaananaa behad jaruri he
 According to one estimate, a tiger is killed every day
 yahi halaat rahe to agle paanch saalon main baagh hameshaa ke liye jangal se gaayab ho jaaenge
 Raghav has raised the issue of illegal tiger hunting in India in his book 'saint of a Game'
 is rochak kitaab ke jariye raghav ne kai deshon main baaghon se jude mahatvapurn muddon ko bayaan kiya he
 The story of the book begins with a bio-genetics company laying a trap for their business in a forest in central India
 is mileebhagat ke baad badi maadaa naam kii maadaa tiger ko maarane kii khabaren aati hai
 Ram, the protagonist of the story, fights a battle against the local police
 police ram par hi maadaa tiger ko maarane kii baat kahati he
 As the story progresses, Ram gets caught in the clutches of the people involved in the tiger killing business
 kitaab main ram ke bure halaat se baahar nikalne kii kahani hi kitaab ko jod kar rakhti he
 The book also succeeds in causing uneasiness in the minds of readers when they think about the whereabouts of the female tiger
 lekhak ke bare memlekhak apni profeshnal kshamtaaon ko dekhte hue kanha or bandhavgarh jaise rashtriya udyanon main rukate hai
 Because of this they are able to create a better picture on this issue
 lekhak raghav ne kitaab ko likhane se pehle kaaphi research kii he
 In the book, Raghav reveals some heart touching facts
 multinational companiyon se santhganth se sambandhit tathyon ko bhi rakhane main raghav safal sabit hote hai
 The story of how is the book mercilessly tells the tiger to be killed mercilessly
 kahani bataati he ki badi companiyaan baagh ko maarane ke baad bane utpaadon kaa kis tarah se vyapaar karti hai
 People are suggested to save tigers in the story
 haalanki baaghon kii sankhya badhaane or bachaane kii salaah ke peeche kaa sach kuch or hi hakeekat bayaan karata he
 The story of this book is very interesting
 kahani kaa nayak kai maukey par baaghon ko marane se bachaata he
 Instead of giving the book a happy ending, the book leaves readers with a question about what we should do to save the ever-decreasing tigers
 kitaab kii kahani main badi maadaa kii maut hoti he yaa nahin
 It will be interesting to know about this when reading this book
 kahani main jis tarah se baaghon ko maarane kii koshish kii jaati he, ye kisse kitaab main behad dilchaspee paidaa karne vaale hai
 Raghav's book 'saint of a Game' is worth reading as well as praise
 jammu main mangalvaar ko ek mini bas ke khai main girane se 14 logon kii maut ho gai or 30 anya log ghayal ho gaye
 The condition of 10 of them is said to be critical

 a new discovery of the 'natural History Museum' has revealed that these people not only ate human flesh but also used corpse skulls as cups and bowls
 ‘di daily telegraph’ akhbaar kii khabar ke anusaar is khoj ko saamne laane vaale jeevashm vigyaniyon ko cheder gorge se teen logon ke avshesh mili hai, jo 14700 saal puraane hai

 Professor Chris Stringer of the 'natural History Museum' said, 'at that time living was very difficult and it was better to eat food than your rivals
 isse apane dushman par bhi aapaki shreshthata sabit hoti thi
 According to Professor Stringer, those people were not demons and knew what they were doing
 unhone kaha ki vah log itane viksit the ki vah logon kaa kaayade se antim sanskaar karte the

 In Sangli, Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil said about Maratha reservation, whatever the state government did
 ab is maamle par adaalat faisla karegi
 The minister said that some 'paid' people have entered the Maratha movement
 yah baat ghisi-pity lag sakati he, lekin sach yah he ki 2009 ke aam chunaavon kaa sabase bada vijeta aam aadmi hi he kyonki usne congress ko aisa janadesh diya he ki ab vah kaam na karne kaa koi bahaanaa nahin kar sakati
 Although these elections were being called pointless, the biggest issue was the fragmented nature of Indian politics
 is mudde kaa kam-se-kam agle paanch saal ke liye samaadhaan kar diya gaya he
 The defeat of the Left was particularly important
 unhone is myth ko failaane main koi kotahi nahin barti ki 2004 kaa janadesh sudhaaron ke khilaaf tha
 Communists have mastered the art of saying half-false and half-truths all over the world and our own comrades are not far behind
 iskaa nateeja yah niklaa ki upie sarkaar un aarthik sudhaaron ko laane main vifal rahi jiskaa congress ne apane chunaav ghoshnaa patr main vaada kiya tha
 It is a matter of fact that his ministers, who hold important portfolios like education and home, did nothing and did more work than bad work
 baharhaal, vamapanthiyon kii haar ke peeche galat kaaran ho sakate hai
 While Mamata Banerjee has been successful in demolishing the Marxist stronghold due to her three-decade-old campaign against the Left, West Bengal has suffered irreparable damage due to the withdrawal of the Nano car project
 ham sabhi jaanate hai ki mamata kis cheez kaa virodh karti hai
 But the real question is what is his point of view? Politics of ambition: For the next five years, the Congress will not have to lead a government in whose path its partners constantly create problems and keep pulling their legs
 2004 ke chunaavon ke baad dow
 Manmohan Singh had announced that his government would prove to be an effective government and bring reforms on the governance front
 lekin unki sarkaar ne loklubhaavan yojanaayen lagu kerani shuru kar deen
 At that time there was a boom in the economy due to which there was no shortage of funds for these schemes
 lekin arthvyavastha main aayaa oochaal upie sarkaar kii nitiyon se kahin adhik pichley paanch saal kii nitiyon kaa parinaam tha
 The boom in the global economy also played an important role in that
 lekin ab vikaas kii raftaar sust pad jane se sarkaar ke khajaane par bhi dabaav badhane laga he
 One thing becomes clear when traveling across the country that the level of demonetisation has changed forever
 is baat main ratti bhar andeh nahin he ki media, mobile telephoni or sadakon ke vikaas kaaryakramon, khaas taur par rajg ke banaae kaaryakramon ne bharat ko hameshaa ke liye badal diya he
 Access to information has greatly increased people's aspirations and access to goods and services has helped fulfill those aspirations
 samaveshi vikaas ke naare ne logon ke maanas par gaharaa prabhaav choda he or har koi uske fal main hissedari chahta he
 People want opportunities to fulfill their aspirations, not a bailout from the mai-baap government
 kisaan bijli kii abaadhit aapurti chaahate hai, na ki muft kii bijli
 The bailout should be limited to the population living below the poverty line as they need the help of the welfare state
 jahaan tak raajnneeti ke morche kaa sawaal he, to janadesh jane-anjaane sthirataa ke liye mila he
 It was clear for a long time that a party desirous of getting close to power on its own would have to perform well in the Hindi arena in any case
 is kshetra ko kshetreey partiyon ne jati, up-jati or dharm ke aadhaar par chunavi ganit baitha kar hathiyaa liya tha
 Actually, he played the game of divide and rule
 dekhadekhi rashtriya partiyaan bhi is tarah ke khel main shaamil ho gayi
 His character did not differ much from regional parties
 isse rajnatik takat to hasil hui, lekin hindibhashi rajyon kii sthiti jas-kii-tas bani rahi
 In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the name Vikas was missing
 congress ko in rajyon main akele chunaav ladane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, jo uske liye vardaan sabit hua
 Rahul Gandhi's tremendous election campaign and the well-publicized and well-planned 'bharat Khoj Yatra' worked in favor of the Congress
 upie kii nitiyon main rashtriya gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana (naregaa) or kisaan rin maafee yojana par sabase adhik dhyaan diya gaya or unka bad-chadhakar prachaar kiya gaya
 Does this mean that the days of regional politics or opportunistic politics are over? Not at all
 yah aap uttar pradesh ke nateezon ko dekhen to spasht ho jayega ki basapa kaa vot pratishat badha he or bhaajapa kii kshati se congress ko laabh hua he
 SP also cannot be considered as a lost power in Uttar Pradesh
 maharashtra main maharashtra navnirmaan sena (emenes) shivasena ke vot bank main send lagaati rahi he jiske kaaran congress ko vahaan chah-saat siton kaa ijapha hua
 The regional party Trinamool Congress won in West Bengal
 vahaan congress kii sthiti sudharne ke koi asaar nahin dikh rahe hai
 In Kerala, the vote percentage of the Left remains the same, but the bjp's vote percentage decreased, which benefited the Congress
 in chunaavon main ek rujhaan shaayad yah rahaa ki matadaataaon ne party ke prati nishtha kii andekhi karte hue apane hit samoohon ke jeetne yogya ummidavaar ko vot diya
 Among the regional parties, the Left Front, RJD and SP lost a large number of seats
 or is kshati main sambandhit rajya se jude muddon kii ahm bhoomika rahi
 Most of these issues were related to governance and law and order
 sarkaar se naaraazgi koi mudda nahimera maananaa he ki bhartiya matadaata pichley kuch samay se kshetreey raajnneeti ke khatme se kahin adhik yah sandesh dete rahe hai ki sarkaar chaahe kisi kii ho, unke liye to keval acha shashan myne rakhata he
 In a CLSA report in January 2009, we wrote, "the 2008 elections in the states gave a clear indication that resentment from the government is no longer an issue
" aisa lagata he-or samay-samay par yah sabit bhi ho gaya-ki sattarudh sarkarein apane achche pradarshan or majboot sthaneey netritv ke boote chunaav jitati hai
 If this trend continues, it will benefit Indian democracy
 '' dilli, gujarat, bihar, madhya pradesh, orissa or chhattisgarh spasht rup se yah sandesh dete dikhte hai
 i met some BJP supporters in Rae Bareli in February this year who said they would vote for the Congress
 vajah poochne par unhone kaha ki yahaan rail coach factory lagane se rojgaar kaa srijan hoga
 Even in Bihar, where Nitish Kumar's popularity is increasing, if the congress-rjd-ljp had fought under the pre-election alliance, the results could have been different
 andhra pradesh main congress kaa vot pratishat apni jagah bana rahaa, haalanki usne kai rajyon main apane ummidavaar khadey kiye the
 The difference in Andhra Pradesh was that the votes of the regional parties were split and Chiranjeevi's Praja Rajyam Party acted to spoil the TDP
 bhartiya loktantr main ativaadee raajnneeti-chaahe vamapanthiyon kii ho yaa dakshinpanthiyon kii-apraasangik he
 Therefore, the BJP and the left have a lot to learn
 yah thodaa kalpit vichaar lag saktaa he kyonki isse udaaravaadi paryvekshak khush ho sakate hai
 The vote percentage of Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena and Communists shows that there are supporters of extremist ideas here
 assam ke kuch hisson main eudief ke ubhaar par gaur kiijie
 Radical ideas may be marginalized, but they are dangerous for India's pluralistic society and state
 nihsandeh, bhaajapa ko is baat par vichaar karnaa hoga ki bharat kaa dhruvikaran kiye bina dakshinpanthi madhyamargi party bana ja saktaa he
 The timing of these elections should have been beneficial for any opposition party, but the BJP mingled and failed to take advantage
 shashan or sudhaaron ke liye janadeshchunaavon main congress ko nirnaayak janadesh milane par share bazaar ne ummid ke anuroop hi pratikriya vyakt kii
 At the same time, there was also an expectation that India's policy-makers would bring economic reforms back on track
 bharat ke vikaas kii raftaar ko dobaaraa hasil karne or arthvyavastha ko vruddhi ke majboot raste par laane ke liye hamen arthvyavastha or shashan, donon maamalon main sudhaaron ko sakhti se lagu karnaa hoga
 If we talk about the past, the reforms were not easy to implement
 jahaan tak vartmaan kii baat he, to ab bhi sudhaaron ko lagu karnaa aasaan nahin hoga, khaskar maujuuda vaishvik maahaul ko dekhte hue
 It is important to note here that in the liberal system, all kinds of questions are being raised due to the excess of capitalism and exploitation
 samekit vittiya ghaataa / sakal gharelu utpaada (jisamen tel, urvarak or anaaj jaise pradeshik or of-balance utpaada shaamil hai) 2009 ke vitt varsh main 11 pratishat bad gaya he
 The reason for this is that light tax revenue and higher social expenditure, increase in salaries of government employees, farm loan waiver and subsidy have been interlinked
 ham dekhte hai ki vitt varsh 2010 ke liye ghaataa pehle ke str par bana hua he, jise puraa karne ke liye sarkaar ko 3
 1 lakh crore Rs
 udhaar lene honge
 At the moment, the government's borrowing scheme has had a limited impact on the interest rate as private sector loan demand falls, policy rate cuts, the introduction of market stabilization scheme (MSS) bonds by the Reserve Bank of India and inflation to almost zero percent It has been offset by the increase
 lekin agar vittiya ghate par kaabo paane ke liye dhiladhaala ravaiya apanaaya gaya to bonds se hone vaali aay ghat jaaegi kyonki nijee rin kii maang or dabloopiaai mudrasphiti vitt varsh 2010 kii duusari chamahi se badhani shuru ho jaaegi
 Also, any possibility of reversing the accommodative monetary policy will cause the shares to fall
 chunki vaishvik mandi se arthvyavastha charmara gai he, isliye sarkaar ko apni kuch loklubhaavan yojanaon ke liye paise jutaney main mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 Will Manmohan Singh be able to give good governance and implement economic reforms? Or will they adopt an apology for the economic policies adopted by India after 1991? UPA President and Congress Supremo Sonia Gandhi has said that Indira Gandhi's policy of nationalization of banks has saved the Indian finance system
 2009 main congress ke chunaav ghoshnaptr ko padhane se koi adhik ummid nahin jagati
 Despite this, election manifestos should not be given much priority
 yadi congress janadesh ko 'billi ke bhagya se chhinka tuutane' jaisaa nahin maanati, balki uskaa shrey pichley paanch saal kii apni loklubhaavan nitiyon or aksham shashan ko detii he to yah khushrahmi jaldi hi kafoor ho jaaegi
 The people of India, irrespective of their socio-economic status, are looking for opportunities for progress and an equal playing field
 unhen rajyatantr ke sangrakshan kii jarurat nahin he kyonki vah unhen garib, pichhadaa or agyani banaae rakhata he

 This car was sold in California at an auction for 3 million eight million dollars (about 200 crore rupees)
 aaj tak kisi car ke liye itani badi rakam nahin di gai
 The interesting thing is that it was estimated that this car will be auctioned for 50 million dollars

 In college days it often happens that our heart likes someone and our mind advocates someone else
 samaj nahin aata ki kise chune
 Both are liked, close to you and both are sensitive to you
 kahin na kahin aapako is baat kaa ehsaas bhi hota he ki ve aapako bahut jaldi prapoj bhi kar sakate hai
 There is no sense in delaying this
 aap jitani jaldi ye faisla kar len, utana acha rahegaa
 You may not agree with this, but in matters like relationship, it is only wise to pay attention to the heart
 iske alaava ye tips bhi aapke liye madadgaar sabit honge
 1
 sabase pehle to ye tay karen ki lambey vakt ke saathi ke rup main aap kise zyada yogya maanati hai
 Every relationship changes with time
 jaruri nahi ki jo shaks aaj aap kii har baat ko swechha se sweekaar kar letaa ho wo aage bhi aisa hi kare
 In such a situation, it would be better to choose the person who is not stubborn and trusts in listening to others
 2
 You have two options
 aise main donon ko zyada se zyada samajhane kii koshish karen
 Look at their conversation and compare the two with small things
 aapako aapke sawaal kaa jawaab mil jayega
 3
 ye aapke liye jindagibhar kaa faisla he
 In such a situation there is no scope for any kind of experiment
 aapke saamne jo log hai donon apane bhavishya ko lekar kya sochate hai, bhavishya ko lekar unki kya yojanaayen hai, ye sabakuch jaanane kii koshish karen
 It will help to find the answer to the question
 4
 Do a comparative study of the behavior of both
 kya donon main se koi aisa he jo aapako lekar jarurat se zyada samvedansheel he? agar haa to us shaks ko chunanaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 The behavior of such people usually becomes aggressive over time

 Are there any of them who give priority to your talent rather than your external beauty? If yes, then this is the person who can become your soul mate
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (NDA) kii ore se narendra modi kaa naam pradhanmantri pad ke liye jagajaahir he
 But all the parties including Congress are hesitant to make the face of PM post public
 vaise andarkhaane sabhi chote-bade dalon main se ek cheharaa res main he, unhen bhi lagata he ki jod-tod kii raajnneeti main kuch bhi sambhav he or mauka mila to piem kii kursi bhi haath lag sakati he
 Actually, the Bharatiya Janata Party also has questions from the opposition, who is their face for the post of PM? Especially this question is asked to the Congress, although the Congress has no differences in the party regarding Rahul Gandhi, but the party has been avoiding making the name public
 vahiin bispi pramukh mayawati, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamat banerjee, sharad pavaar, arvind kejariwal samet tamaam kshetreey dalon ke bade chehron kaa piem kii kursi par najar he
 But the big question is, who is the biggest face of the opposition in comparison to Narendra Modi, who can give a tough challenge in 2019
 ajtak ne karvi incits ke jariye janata kii nabj tatolane kii koshish kii he
 After all, who is the biggest popular face of the opposition as an alternative to the Narendra Modi whom the opposition is talking about removing from power
 survey main poocha gaya ki narendra modi ke vikalp ke taur par vipaksh main 2019 ke liye pradhanmantri pad kaa sabase bada cheharaa koun he?survey main hamen jo jawaab mila usamen congress ke liye badi raahat kii baat he
 However, in the survey, the names of heads of several regional parties have also emerged as contenders for the post of PM
 janvari 2019 main hue survey ke mutabik 52 fisad log narendra modi ke vikalp ke taur par rahul gandhi ko vipaksh kii ore se piem pad ke daavedaan maanate hai
 Apart from this, 8 percent to Mamata Banerjee, 5 percent to Priyanka Gandhi, 5 percent to P
 Chidambaram, 5 percent to Akhilesh Yadav and 5 percent to Arvind Kejriwal are also considered as candidates for the post of PM from the opposition in 2019
 jabaki mayawati ko 3 fisad, sharad pavaar ko 2 fisad or mahaj ek fisad log ke chandrashekhar raav ko 2019 main piem kii kursi par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 In the survey, a figure appears to be in favor of Congress
 yahi sawaal jab agast 2016 main kiya gaya tha tab 23 fisadi log rahul ko piem modi ke vikalp ke taur par maanate the
 Since then, Rahul Gandhi's graph has steadily increased
 agast 2018 main 46 fisad log rahul ko modi kaa vikalp maanate the, jabaki janvari main ye aankada 52 fisad tak pahunch gaya he
 At the same time, in February 2016, 10 percent people considered Mayawati as an alternative to Narendra Modi from the opposition, but now this figure has come down to 3 percent
 is survey ek tasviir saaf ho gai he ki desh kii janata vipaksh main piem modi ke vikalp ke taur par rahul gandhi ko sabase bada cheharaa maanati he
 Not only this, Rahul Gandhi's claim has been strengthened in the last three years, and it is a good sign for the Congress

 Australia's new coach Justin Langer said his team would be called great only if it wins the Test series in India
 isaki tulana unhone mount everest fatah karne se kii kyonki australian team ne pichhali baar 2004 main bharat main test siries jiti thi
 Langer, who takes over the reins of the Australian cricket team in place of Darren Lehman, faces several big tournaments, but for him touring the Indian subcontinent is the highest challenge
 lenger ne kaha, ‘hamen world cap, tii-20 world cap or do ashes (2019 main or 2021-22 main) main khelnaa he
 When i think about it, i get nervous
 kuch bade toornament hone hai
 'langer said,' but ultimately if i look to the future, the Indian Test tour (2021) in three to four years is the highest in my eyes
 agar ham bharat ko bharat main haraa pate hai, to hi faisla kar paaenge ki ham mahaan team hai yaa nahin
 "why should i be like Kohli when he can hit long sixes?" Langer was a member of the team that won the 2–1 Test series in India, led by Adam Gilchrist in 2004, and in his view it was like conquering Mount Everest
 
 lenger kaa maananaa he ki bharat main jeet se bhaavnaatmak rup se tut chuki rashtriya team kaa aatmavishvaas badhegaa
 He said, 'if i look at my career, a moment like Mount Everest came in 2004 when we finally defeated India in India
 hamen videshon main behatar pradarshan karnaa hoga, ham tabhi mahaan team banenge jab ham videsh or swadesh main jeetenge isliye aisa karnaa hamaara lakshya hoga
 Langer admitted that when Australia hosts many other teams including India this year, they will miss former captain Steve Smith and former vice-captain David Warner
 in donon ke alaava yuva test salaami ballebaaj kemran bencroft ko haal main gend se chhedchhad prakaran main unki bhoomika ke liye nilambit kiya gaya he
 Asked what he planned to make up for the absence of Smith and Warner, who have contributed 37 per cent of Australia's Test runs since 2014, Langer said, "it will be difficult to find an alternative to their runs and experience
" ’lenger ne kaha, ‘agle 11 maheene main kuch khilaadiyon ke liye yah mauka hoga jiskaa unhen phayda uthaanaa hoga
 We have to strengthen and provide depth in the team
 bade toornamenton ke liye ve bade khilaadi hai

 Amazing feat in the amazing MP for the relief of frog-frog divorce was done for the first rain
 With the wish of good rain, you have seen and heard many people doing various tricks
 acchhee barish ke liye inamen se sabase zyada prachlit totaka he mendhak or mendhaki kii shaadi
 But have you heard about the divorce of frogs and frogs? If you have not heard, we tell you
 ajab madhyapradesh main gajab kaa ye vakya hua he
 In fact, due to heavy rains, people in the capital Bhopal divorced frogs and frogs
 jab empi main barish nahin ho rahi thi, logon ko sookhe kii ashanka sata rahi thi, to acchhee barish kii ummid main logon ne 19 july 2019 ko mendhak or mendhaki kii shaadi karwaai thi
 These people believed that Lord Indra would be pleased with the marriage of frogs and frogs and there would be good rains in the state
 bhagwaan ne inaki prarthana sun lee or madhya pradesh main jamkar barish hui, lekin aisa lagata he kiye indra devtaa kuch zyada hi khush gaye
 This time there is torrential and continuous rains in MP
 yahaan ab itani barish ho chuki he ki janata har ore trahimam kar rahi he
 As of September 11, Madhya Pradesh has received 26 percent more rainfall than normal and flood-like conditions have occurred in most parts of Madhya Pradesh
 yahi nahin rajdhani bhopal main to barish kareeb 13 saal purana record todane ke paas pahunch gai he
 (photo-aaj Tak) Bhopal has recorded 45 percent more rain than normal so far
 alam yah he ki beete 1 hafte se bhopal ke do dam kaliyasot or bhadbhada ke get khule hue hai
 At the same time, all the gates of Kolar Dam have to be opened after 3 years
 mausam vibhaag ne pichley teen dinon main madhya pradesh ke 32 se 38 jilon main baari barish kii chetavanee jari kii thi
 On Wednesday too, after the heavy rains, Bhopal's lower settlements were flooded
 ab baari barish kii is traasadee se bachane ke liye logon ko ek baar phir se bhagwaan yaad aae hai
 Members of the Om Shiva Seva Shakti Mandal in Indrapuri area symbolically divorced the frogs and frogs on Wednesday evening
 is dauraan baqayda mantrocchar bhi kiya gaya or phir vidhivat mendhak or mendhaki ko alag kiya gaya
 The members of Om Shiva Seva Shakti Mandal believe that the way the frog has been ravaged by heavy rains in the state after the frog's marriage, now the people of the state will get relief from heavy rains after separating them

 (from input language) 'lav jihad' ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaane ke mansoobey par bavaal machane ke baad bhaajapa ke apane kadam waapas khinchne liye hai
 Meanwhile, Muslim religious leaders have said that no such campaign is going on in the country for the conversion of Hindu religious people for marriage and the saffron party has left this shigufa just for political gain
 daarul ulum devband bhi apane kai fatvon main mahaj shaadi ke liye muslim dharm kubul karne ko galat tehra chukaa he
 Shahi Imam Maulana Ahmed Bukhari of Jama Masjid in Delhi said that there is no such thing as 'love Jihad' in Islam
 islam kisi sajeesh ke tahat nahin failaa
 He does not allow anyone to be forced or emotionally forced to convert
 aise jihad kii baaten sirf nafrat failaane kii sajeesh kaa hissaa hai
 He said that the issue of 'love Jihad' is not new
 isse pehle vishwa hindu parishad ne bhi 'lav jihad' ke shigufe ke jariye musalamaanon ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii thi
 Now the BJP wants to cash in on this issue
 hindu or muslim kaumon ko iske khilaaf khadey hokar aisi sajishon kaa jawaab dena chahie
 On the other hand, Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, termed 'love Jihad' as an attempt to make sesame palm, and said that Jihad is called a struggle for any noble cause and 'love Jihad' Anything like that is un-islamic and deserves condemnation
 jihad ko sampradayikta se jodakar dekhnaa nikrusht maansikta kaa pratik he
 Maulana Farangi Mahali said, 'no Tehreek (movement) like Love Jihad is going on behalf of Muslims
 shaadi ke liye dharmantaran ke ikkaa-dukka vaakyaat hue hai, usase puure samudaay ko kathghare main khadaa karnaa galat he
 'love Jihad' is a false propaganda
 ham samajhate hai ki siyaasi laabh lene ke liye ise mudda banaaya ja rahaa he jo hindustan ke sarvadharm sambhaav ko kamjor karata he
 'he said,' We are against the idea that a Muslim boy or girl should convert a non-muslim and marry him
 ' Some edicts of Maulana's famous Islamic educational institution Darul Uloom Deoband also reinforce this
 daarul ulum devband ke daarul iftaa vibhaag dwaara aath march 2012 tathaa 22 march 2012 ko alag-alag prashnkartaaon dwaara puche gaye sawaalon par die gaye fatvon main mahaj shaadi ke liye muslim dharm kubul kiye jane ko galat bataate hue kaha gaya tha ki aisi shaadiyaan na karnaa hi behatar he
 Meanwhile, Maulana Yasub Abbas, spokesperson of the All India Shia Personal Law Board, also said that Islam considers anyone to be forcibly converted to Islam, so if it is wrong it is wrong and to associate this act with jihad is a crime
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki 'lav jihad' bhaajapa kaa gadha hua shabd he or vah is par siyasat kar rahi he
 It is worth mentioning that the issue of 'love Jihad' was raised in the meeting of bjp's state executive held in Mathura yesterday
 party netaaon ne muslim ladke-ladakiyon dwaara shaadi ke naam par duusare majahab ke yuvak-yuvatiyon kaa dharmantaran karaane kii muhim chalane or pradesh sarkaar par use sangrakshan dene ke aarope lagaaye the
 The party, however, has not included it in its proposal

 aapako bataa den ki pichley kuch dinon se daagi chhavi vaale police waalon ko chinhit kar unhen unke pad se hataane kii prakriya chal rahi he
 In the first week of July this year, Operation Cleanup was started in the police department following the order of DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, which identified tainted and corrupt policemen all over Bihar
 iske baad in daagi or bhrashtachari police karmiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii gai

 Of these 19 policemen, 17 are Thanedars and two are Circle Inspector rank officers

 Under the Operation Cleanup, the Police Headquarters had set certain criteria, on the basis of which strict action has been taken against the police personnel after they were not found fit

 The police headquarters has also taken action against such policemen, who have proved negligent in strictly enforcing the liquor ban law in the state

 The proposal was agreed without the approval of the Labor Party's National Executive Party or party leader Jeremy Corbyn

 Explaining his stand on Kashmir, Vaz further said, "issues of sovereignty are a matter for the Government of India; Boundary issues are matters for the governments of India and Pakistan
