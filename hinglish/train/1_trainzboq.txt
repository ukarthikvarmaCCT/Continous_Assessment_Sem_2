 The world famous Sonepur fair has started, it is considered to be the largest cattle fair market across Asia
 lekin sonpur kaa mela theatre ko lekar bhi haal ke dinon main prasiddhi paata rahaa he
 Questions about pornography in the theater continue to be raised, but in spite of this, more than a dozen theaters are held in Sonpur every year
 is saal saaran prashasan ne theatreon ko license dene se mana kar diya unka kahana he ki theatre se ashleelata failati he
 That too when the theater was set up in the Sonepur fair , crores of rupees have been spent, now all the theaters and girls working in it are on the streets due to not getting the license from the administration
 bihar ke sonpur meley main mangalvaar ko theatre main kaam kerani vaali ladakiyon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 After this, the police reached the spot and assured the girls that the administration would review its decision
 iske baad hangaamaa shant ho sakaa
 Babli, who dances in the theater, says that we earn money at the fair by showing our art and do not make anything dirty
 baavjood iske jila prashasan theatre kii anumati nahin de rahaa he
 On the other hand, Saran SP Harihar Prasad says that if there is a healthy environment, then there will be no objection to granting license to the administration, but it will be objectionable if it runs on the basis of earlier practice
 sonpur meley kaa aayojan har saal hota he or har saal yahaan theatre bhi lagate hai
 The administration has installed CCTV cameras in the theater for the past several years to prevent pornography, and has made all the arrangements
 iske baavjood espi kii najar main ashleelata hoti he to iske liye jimmedaar koun he
 The reason for this may also be that the administration is not able to supervise it properly
 duusari taraf agar saaran ke espi ko ashleelata kaa khatra najar aa rahaa tha to unhen theatre lagane kii anumati pehle se hi nahin deni chahie
 But when the stage of the theater is finished, hundreds of girls have reached, then there was a ruckus on this decision of the administration
 jald hi railgadee ke andar railway ke radio kii bhi aawaaj guunjegi
 Railways is preparing to launch a railway radio channel on the lines of FM radio on all its trains and stations
 khaas baat ye he ki iske liye rail mantralay, soochna or prasaaran mantralay ke paas license ke liye applai nahin karne ja rahaa he
 If a high railway official is to be believed, this will not be needed as the Railways is planning to start an internet based radio channel
 internet aadhaarit radio ke liye alag se license lene kii jarurat nahin padati he
 According to a top railway official, FM radio is not possible in the moving train
 aise main sabase tikaoo or kargar tarika he internet par aadhaarit radio channel
 The railway is gradually moving towards providing high speed wi-fi service at all railway stations
 aise main railway ne yojana banaai he ki har ek train par 6 ghante tak ke content ko downlod karke prasaarit karne ke liye sarwar lagaaya jayega
 This channel will continue to broadcast radio channels
 jahaan par net seva milegi vahaan par radio channel sidhe internet se prasaarit hoga
 The special thing is that in every railway zone, there will be broadcast of radio radio in the language there
 yani jaisaa pradesh waisi bhashaa
 For radio transmission, speakers will be installed at different places in the trains
 jarurat padane par rail radio par aavashyak anounsament bhi kiye ja sakenge
 According to railway data, about 2 every day across the country
 5 karod log paisanger-express gadiyon main safar karte hai
 In such a situation, so many passengers will be the default listeners of rail radio
 is samay desh bhar main takreeban 12 karod log efem radio ke shrota maane jate hai
 There is an annual advertising market of about Rs 2500 crore for radio
 railvaco lagata he ki apane yatriyon ke balboote wo 500 karod rupee vigyaapan bazaar par apana kabja aasaani se jamaa legi
 Therefore, the future of rail radio is considered bright
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki bhartiya railway apane radio channel ko chalaane ke liye nijee company ko theka degi
 Tenders will be invited soon for this

 40-year-old Jatin Sarin's cricket bat making factory in the village is a museum in itself
 yahaan 100 saal puraane balle hi nahin, ve bat bhi maujuud hai jinase khelte hue duniya ke diggaj ballebaajon ne kai record banaae hai
 Jatin, MD of Sarin Sports Industries, has such bats hanging on the walls in his office on the first floor of a four-acre factory
 ek kone par saje bat se mashhoor khilaadi virendra sahvaag ne 309 ran banaae the
 The bat also hangs in the middle which led to Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara scoring a triple century
 yahaan sachin tendulkar or saurav ganguli kaa recorddhari balla he to australia ke adam gilcrist kaa bhi
 Jatin's eyes glow as soon as he talks about the bats
 ve behad fakhr se kehete hai, “pehle hindustani log goron ke banaae bat se khelte the, ab gore hamaare banaae bat se khelte hai
 After the partition of the country, Jatin's grandfather came from Pakistan and settled in Meerut
 pachaas ke dashak main unhone badminton kaa shatalkock bananaa shuru kiya
 But Jatin's father Ann
 ke
 Sarin was not much interested in badminton
 ve un dinon college ke dauraan cricket khilne ke shaukeen the
 He participated in many college level competitions
 yaheen se unke man main cricket ke balle banane kaa khyaal aayaa
 In 1969 he started his own company and opened a bat factory in Meerut
 is company ke banaae balle “eses bat” ke naam se pahachaane gaye
 During that time, bats were made in the world with two types of wood "kashmir willow" and "english willow"
 bharat main keval kashmir wilo kaa hi prachlan tha
 "english willow" wooden bats were expensive and only the rich played with them
 en
 K
 sareen ne pehali baar “english wilo” lakdi kaa videsh se aayaat kiya or isse bat bananaa shuru kiya
 At that time, he signed with Syed Kirmani and Roger Binny, who used to play cricket with their bat
 iske baad manoj prabhakar ne unke ballon se khelnaa shuru kiya or isi company se bane balle se khelte hue vinod kambli ne 1993 main england ke khilaaf doharaa shatak jadaa
 The new round of SS Bats began when Ann
 ke
 Sarin's son Jatin took up the task of making the bat in 1997
 meerut college se grajuation karne ke baad ve balla banane kaa gur seekhney england chale gaye
 At that time, bats made by John Newbri in England were famous in the world
 unhone kareeb saal bhar jon newtori ke saath bitaayaa or unase har ve baarikiyaan sikhin jo vishwastareey balla banane ke liye jaruri hoti hai
 After returning to Meerut, Jatin spent a lot of time with many cricket players including Tendulkar, Ganguly
 in khiladinnon se mili suzav ke aadhaar par unhone desh main 28 millimetre kii chaudaai vaale patale balle kii jagah 40 millimetre ke bhi adhik mote balle banane kaa chalan shuru kiya or ek khaas takneekee se in ballon kaa handle banaaya taaki inamen loch rahe
 In striking the cricket ball, "english willow" was not the answer to these bats made of wood
 inase takaraa kar ball kahin tej or dur tak jaati thi
 Jatin himself gave special training to his employees to manufacture these bats
 jald hi ye mote balle tendulkar or ganguli jaise khiladinnon kii pasand ban gaye
 Initially, 100-150 bats were made daily, now about 700 bats are made daily
 tendulkar ne jab bhi acchhee cricket kheli unke balle par “ton” (yani 100) jarur likhaa mila
 "ton" is a brand of SS bat called N
 ke
 Sarin got registered in the '70s
 tendulkar ne jab 35 shatak puure kiye to duniya kii mashhoor company “okale” ne unhen 35 chashme uphaar ke taur par die
 Out of these, Chashma Tendulkar, number 27, also presented Jatin with a letter of gratitude
 2007 ke baad tii 20 cricket kaa daur shuru hua to mote par halke eses bat kii maang ne jor pakadaa
 International companies like Puma, Adidas, Nike started making bats from Jatin itself
 vishwa cricket ke sabase krantikari balle “mongoose” kii takanic to england main bani par ise meerut main jatin kii factory main hi banaaya gaya
 This particular type of bat was small but its handle was long
 australian cricket khilaadi mathew heden ne ipiel main “mongoose” bat se kaaphi charchaa batori thi
 Jatin opened the new factory in 2006, where bats are mostly made by hand
 yahaan 700 ru
 25,000 to Rs
 keemat vaale balle banate hai
 Today, more than 50 international players, including Virat Kohli and England's Ravi Bopara, play with the SS bat
 chaar darjan se zyada deshon main is balle ke dealer hai
 Jatin has started using neon stickers on bats for the first time to protect SS Bats from imitations
 yah jatin kaa jalawaa hi he ki eses bat vishwa cricket main desh kaa loha manavaa rahaa he

 bhartiya janata party kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee narendra modi ne apane blog main opinian pole ke paksh main apni raay rakhi he
 In his blog, Narendra Modi has stated that a ban on opinion polls would be like a ban on the freedom to speak
 modi ne apane blog main congress party par aaropap lagaaya he ki congress janatantr virdohi ho gai he
 While the Congress has strongly advocated a ban on it, calling the opinion poll as 'gorakhandha', 'tamasha' and 'concocted', BJP has said that doing so is neither constitutionally acceptable nor desirable
 Is because it is part of freedom of expression
 congress ne bhaajapa kii is aalochana ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki vah isliye iskaa virodh kar rahi he kyonki vah narendra modi se dari hui he kyonki in surveykshanon main vipakshi dal ko badhat milane kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 Public statements of Congress leaders regarding banning election surveys have come at a time when Congress has written a letter to the Election Commission a few days ago, demanding a ban on the publication and dissemination of such surveys during elections and said that such Surveys are 'flawed', 'non-trustworthy' and 'concocted'

 sabhi log opinian pole lekar saamne aa rahe hai
 '' unhone kaha, ‘nishchit hi, jab media publicity karne lagata he, log usase prabhavit hote hai
 Therefore, it has been the right demand of the party
 pole se pehle tatasth dimag hona chahie
 Singh dismissed the argument that the Congress had changed its stand on the issue
 unhone kaha, ‘aaj se nahin, ham pehle din se hi iske khilaaf rahe hai
 On the other hand, opposing Congress's demand for ban on opinion polls, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said that the election analysis in India is still maturing and some opinion polls may be wrong, but this does not mean That they be banned

 ' unhone kaha ki raajnneetik dal tab in opinian pole ko khaarij karne kii maang karte hai jab ve unke pratikul hote hai
 Normally the one who is in loss demands a ban while the one who is in profit is in favor of continuing it
 jetali ne kaha, ‘aise pole par pratibandh par is aadhaar par nahin vichaar kiya ja saktaa he ki koun aisi maang uthaa rahaa he
 Clearly (opinion) poll is part of freedom of expression

 According to opinion poll on assembly elections, BJP is going to win easily in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh

 The Federal Front is governed by a powerful concept that is at the heart of the Constitution of India

 It has also been at the heart of the intense political debate of at least the last four decades

 After passing the resolution of independence in Lahore in 1930, the Congress needed to change its mission; Independence did not mean the departure of the British

 30 april ko bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) ne ek aadesh jari kiya or isamen cabel televijan networks (niyaman) sanshodhan kanoon disambar 2011 ko lagu karne ke taur-tareekon kaa byoraa dene ko kaha gaya
 a controversial section of the order has hit the broadcasting business, especially TV news
 isse ek achche kanoon yaa sudhaar ke bepatori hone kaa khatra khadaa ho gaya he
 The main objective of this law of 2011 is that cable television networks adopt new digital technology instead of old analog technology within a stipulated time period
 desh ke chaar metro shaharon ke liye yah samay seemaa july 2012 he
 While it is to be implemented by 2014 across the country
 technology badalane se cabel networks ko kshamta ke lihaaj se raahat milegi, jisaki vajah se ve philhal simit sankhya main channels prasaarit kar paa rahe hai
 An analog signal system requires 7-8 mhz of bandwidth to transmit a single channel, whereas in digital systems 10-15 channels can be broadcast on the same bandwidth
 digital system main darshakon ke paas dekhe jane vaale channelon ke maamle main kahin zyada vikalp honge
 Digitization will provide viewers with the convenience of better picture quality and high definition
 saath hi sound quality bhi behatar hogi
 a 10-15 fold increase in capacity is expected to help the industry take the business forward
 aisi ummid thi ki digitigeshan se broadcasters ko puraane system ke jabariyaa feechar-karij fee se chhutkaaraa mil jayega
 Broadcasters have to pay to Multi System Operators (msos)
 misaal ke taur par desh bhar main pramukh cabel networks par malikana haq rakhane vaale haithve or digicable frenchiji ke rup main mohalle ke cabel operators ko services dete hai or apane signal ko gharon tak pahunchaate hai
 Since msos have limited ability to transmit signals, carriage fees are a type of competitive bidding process that ensures that the broadcaster's channel reaches the audience
 tri ke aadesh kii dhara main karij fee hataane kii bajaay ise banaae rakhane kii anumati dene kii baat kahi gai he
 Carriage fees increase the financial burden of broadcasters, especially news channels, which broadcast their services for free
 aadesh kii dhaaraon ke mutabik, praadhikaran ne faisla kiya he ki har emesao ek karij fee tay kar saktaa he
 It has also been said that broadcasters also share the burden of large investment made by multi-system operators in implementing digital addressable cable TV systems and the carriage cast of channels
 is aadesh ko lekar da news broadcasters association (enbie) khaasi naaraaz he
 The association said in a statement released on May 1 that this carriage fee unfairly penalizes broadcasters and has led to an existential crisis in the broadcasting industry
 time broadcasting ke siio sunil lulla kaa anumaan he ki har saal karij fees kareeb 2,500-3,000 karod ru
 It falls
 unka kahana he ki is rakam ke aadhe hisse kaa bhugtan news broadcasters karte hai
 NDTV executive vice chairman and NBA President KVL Narayan Rao says that "carriage fees can be as high as 30 per cent of the total cost of a news broadcaster
" aise main yah ek bada boj he
 This money can be used to improve content
 '' duusare broadcasters kii tarah raav karij fees ko khatm karne kii ummid kar rahe hai
 Critics say that the act is completely in favor of cable operators
 lekin oparator isse sahamat nahin hai
 Ashok Mansukhani, President of MSO Alliance, says that how can operators alone bear the entire cost of implementing new technology? It costs around Rs 35,000 crore for 10 crore houses
 he
 He argues that since broadcasters would also benefit from digitization, they should also share this burden
 unka kahana he ki broadcasters khaastaur se enbie iskaa sabase zyada virodh kar rahaa he
 But it will benefit the most from its audience and strong subscription base
 in donon chizon kaa istemaal zyada vigyaapan aamadani hasil karne main kiya ja saktaa he
 Its only option is to charge higher fees from customers
 lekin mansukhani badha hua boj graahakon par nahin daalana chaahate hai
 The TRAI order clarifies this by accepting the argument that carriage fees are expected to bear the costs incurred on bringing new technology and increasing capacity of multi-system operators
 tri ke sachiv rajeev agarwal kaa kahana he, ''hamane broadcasters par atirikt vittiya boj nahin daalaa he
 Carriage fees are already being charged
 ''haalanki tri kaa daawa he ki usne vyavastha ko or paardarshee bana diya he
 The order dated April 30 stated that every multi-system operator would print a reference interconnect offer
 isamen use apni karij fees kii jaankaree deni hogi, jisko ki ek samaan, gaiyr bhedbhaavpurn or paardarshee tareeke se lagu kiya janaa chahie
 However, Lulla disagrees with Trai's argument
 unka kahana he ki ''agar aap kisi khaas bijness main hai to aapako usamen nivesh karnaa padataa he
 Why should the burden of that investment be passed on to others? ”agarwal believes that when broadcasters have the right to express their opinions, there should be no dispute
 unka tark he ki jaise hi multi system operataron kii kshamta badhegi karij fees lene se judi unki molbhav kii kshamta ghategi
 "at present, they can charge carriage fees as their capacity is very limited now," he says
 kshamta badhaane ke lihaaj (ausatan 200 se 500 channel) se hamane ise anivaary bana diya he
 He says that after increasing the capacity they have to go to the channels and ask for the signal
 tab multi system operataron kii bazaar ko prabhavit karne kii takat simit ho jaaegi
 "but Rao is not convinced by these things
" lulla kaa kahana he ki disha nirdesh puure vivaran ke saath taiyaar nahin kiye gaye hai
 In such a situation, if the carriage fees are not paid to the multi-system operators, then they can refuse to broadcast the channel
 unke mutabik, ''mujhe isamen koi dikkat nahin hoti, agar tri ne yah kaha hota ki 500 channelon se zyada lene par karij fees lee ja sakati he, lekin unhone aisa kuch nahin kaha he

 mangalvaar ko dopaher 2
 India is going to create history at 38 o'clock
 kyonki isi vakt desh kaa sabase bada antariksh mishan launch hoga
 From Mars mission, India will try to cover all the mysteries associated with the red planet
 mangalayan mishan ke jariye mangal ke kareeb pahunchane vaala bharat duniya kaa teesraa desh ban jayega
 The countdown continues, now India is about to write a new chapter in the history of space science
 bas ab kuch hi lamhon kii darkaar he jab duniyabharat ke chamatkarako namaskara karegi
 The 45 meter high PSLV C25 stands ready and positioned to take Mangalyaan to space at the Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh
 bharat ke antariksh itihaas main 5 november kaa din sabase bade or khaas he
 Because India will be the third country in the world to send a satellite in Mars orbit
 haalanki isro ke chairman kii maane to is abhiyaan ke jariye muqabla kisi or se nahin balki khud se hi he
 Needle clock 2 on the same Tuesday
 38 kaa vakt dikhaaegi, thik usee vakt pieselvi si 25 mangalayan ko lekar aasmaan kaa seenaa chirate hue mangal kii raah par nikal padegaa
 Scientists of India have been working on this mission for a long time
 aise main sawaal he ki aakhir is mishan kaa uddeshy kya he
 Actually, the real objective of India's Mission Mars is to achieve its technical goal in deep space ie Deep Space Communication
 chandramaa se bhi dur jane kaa ye pehla mishan he lihaaja takneeti chunautiyon ko parakhnaa praathamikta he
 Mars is completely new to ISRO, so how will Mangalyaan be controlled from India if it enters Mars's orbit? How will the vehicle last for a certain time? It will also be tested
 mishan mangal se isro ye bhi jaananaa chahta he ki antariksh main kisi apatkaaleen sthiti se kaise nipatega
 At the moment, Mars is being sent, but in the future can any person also be sent to Mars? It will also be searched
 mangalayan main lage mithen sensor for mars kaa kaam he mars par mithen gas ko dhundhna, jisase ye pataa chal sake ki mangal kii dharti par bacteria kaa vaas he yaa nahin
 This will give information about the remains of life on Mars
 mangalayan main lage spectrometer se ye bhi pataa lagane kii koshish hogi ki magal ke garbh main koun se khanij hai
 This is also important because many minerals are formed in the presence of water
 agar bharat kaa mars orbiter mishan yani mangalayan apane makasad main puri tarah se kaamyaab rahata he to phir antariksh vigyaan or takanic kii duniya main hindustan kii pahchaan or kad viipi cote main fiks ho jaaegi
 The specialty of Mangalyaan itself is important
 ise puraa karne main 450 karod rupee lage hai
 Not only this, Mangalyaan will travel 20 million to 40 million kilometers in its journey
 mangalayan mishan se pehle america or rus bhi mangal ke liye yaan bhej chuke hai
 In 1960, Russia tried it for the first time and today American ships are exposing the secrets of the red planet by reaching the surface of Mars
 bharat taiyaar he, duniya ke un chuninda deshon kii qatari main khadaa hone ke liye, jinhen sudur antariksh vigyaan main maharath hasil he
 The countdown to the Mangalyaan mission to get closer to Mars has begun
 laal grah ke saikadon-hajaaron rahasyon ko jaanane ke liye duniya saalon se koshish karti aa rahi he, jiskaa itihaas1960tak peeche jaataa he
 When Russia launched the world's first mission, Mars, named Corabl4
 haalanki ye mishan fail ho gaya
 - In 1965, America's Spacecraft Mariner 4 sent a picture of Mars to Earth for the first time and it proved to be the first successful mission to Mars
 - pehali baar 1971 mensoviet sangh kaa orbiter lander mars 3 yaan mangal par utraa
 - In 1996, the US launched the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft which landed on the surface of Mars with its robotic rover
 - 2004main america ne phir apane do roveryaan spirit or oparchunity ko mangal kii sataha par utaara
 - On 26 November 2011, the US launched Curiosity Rover, which had a successful landing on the surface of Mars on 6 August 2012
 america ke mishan mangal ne abtak lalgrah se kai ahm jaankariyon ke icttha kar nasa ke vaigyanikon tak pahunchaaya he
 The rover is still testing Mars' atmosphere
 saath hi is myth kii bhi khoj ho rahi he ki kabhi magal par jindagi bhi basaa karti thi
 Mission Rover is trying to know if there are favorable conditions for life in any corner of Mars
 mangalayan 3 charnon main mangal kii kaksha main pravesh karegaa
 In the first phase, Mangalyaan will revolve around the earth for 4 weeks
 is dauraan mangalayan dhire-dhire prithvi kii kaksha se dur hota jayega
 In the second phase, Mangalyaan will be out of the Earth's orbit
 tisare charan main 21 sitambar 2014 ko mangal kii kaksha main pravesh karegaa mangalayan
 The ISRO chief prayed to God for the success of the mission before the first Mars expedition to India

 i have worked at various levels in the judiciary (lawyer, high court judge, chief justice and Supreme Court judge) and have seen its dark face, then disclosing all the events will create a storm that i might not face myself

 The Shiv Sena, the bjp's main ally in the NDA, has attacked the Congress, defending Narendra Modi
 shivasena ne apane mukhpatr 'saamana' ke sampadakeey main kaha he, 'congress party kaa dimag gum gaya he
 Modi's head is being blamed for every incident happening inside the country and all future events
 ' gauratlab he ki kendriya mantri kapil sibbal ne modi par bhadakaau bhaashan dene or assam main sampradayik maahaul banane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Shiv Sena says, "when the assassination of Bangladeshi Muslims happens in Assam, Sonia Gandhi immediately arrives there to give assurances but when a Hindu is killed in Kashmir, Sonia does not even reach out to leaders like Kapil Sibal
" 'sibbal par nishaanaa sadhate hue shivasena party ne kaha, 'kapil sibbal ke mutabik modi matlab 'model of dividing india'
 Whereas this applies to the Congress
 todo, phodo or raaj karo, angrejon kii isi niti kii badaulat congress ne ab tak raaj kiya he
 Taking a dig at the Congress allies in the UPA government at the Center, the Shiv Sena said that not only Kapil Sibal, but also the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir has blamed Modi for the Assam incident
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, 'kashmir main lagaataar hone vaali hinsa se kashmiri panditon ko palaayan karnaa padataa he
 Instead of worrying him, Omar Abdullah is concerned that Bodo agitators in Assam are shooting down Bangladeshi Muslims
 ''16 may ke baad paagalakhaane main honge congressi'shivasena kaha ki congress ke logon kaa maansik santulan bigadaa hua he
 After the results of May 16, they may have to be admitted to the mental hospital
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, 'modi desh ko tod rahe hai, yah aarope aisa he maano videshi daaru chadhakar duusare ke munh se aa rahi gandh par oongli uthaanaa
 The question is not only about Assam, but the existence of the entire country
 'shivasena kaa kahana he ki assam ke bhumiputra bodo adivasee desh main ghuse bangladeshiyon se behad pareshaan hai
 Their land is being taken away
 bodo adivasee apni jameen or jindagi bachaane ke liye lard rahe hai, jo congress ko gunaah lag rahaa he
 Just as Hindus and Kashmiri Pandits had to flee in Kashmir, the Bodos flee Assam
 agar sibbal jaise congressi netaaon ko lagata he to yah deshadroh he
 The leader of the Janata Dal u (JDU), the bjp's ally in the NDA, has made objectionable remarks against BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj
 party ke alpsankhyak kamity ke adhyaksh gulam rasul baliyavi ne sakshi maharaj ke diene par sawaal khadey karte hue kaha ki agar unka diene test karaayaa jaayegaa to mughal raja ke kisi mantri kaa diene mil jayega
 JDU MLC Ghulam Rasul Baliyavi said this against him at the Circuit House in Gaya
 unhone sakshi maharaj ke jama masjid par die bayaan ko lekar bhi unpar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Baliavi said that where people are taking the country, when the matter (of Ram temple) is in the Supreme Court, then face it with the facts
 yah bechaini bataa rahi he ki in logon ko mandir se koi matlab nahi hai balkimandirke mudde par raajnneeti kaa vyapaar ho rahaa he
 He said that people of any Muslim community have opposed the construction of the temple? Now it is a matter of the temple or the dispute over the land of the temple
 kisko khodega to kya nikalegaa iske tathyon ke sathsupreme courtmen jaaen
 Baliavi said that the entire land of Gorakhnath temple is owned by Asif Dhaula, if Sakshi Maharaj has strength, then get it checked
 ye log desh samvidhan or adaalat kaa majaak uda rahe hai jisase desh kamjor ho rahaa he
 The JDU leader said on Uddhav Thackeray's Ayodhya program that all these people are creating ruckus on the road, no one has devotion to Ram, it is all power devotion, selfishness and family devotion
 kyonki maharashtra main shivasena kii jameen khatm ho gai he isliye sendhamari karne aae hai
 He said that right now the competition is going on to prove himself as the biggest religious in the country, but Modi ji and Yogi ji understand that the country runs not by faith and religion but by constitution
 bataa den ki haal hi main sakshi maharaj ne kaha tha ki kaashi- mathura- ayodhya chodo, dilli kii jama masjid ko todo, agar sidhiyon se murtiyon naa nikalen to mujhe faansee par lataka dena

 Senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani has once again moved to 'kop Bhavan' after not getting a Lok Sabha ticket from Bhopal and reportedly his differences with Narendra Modi have deepened
 party ne ek baar phir unhen manaane kii koshishen tej kar di hai
 bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi arrived to celebrate her on Thursday morning
 donon kii mulaakaat kareeb ek ghante tak chali, jiske baad modi vahaan se ravaanaa ho gaye
 Shortly afterwards, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj reached Advani's house
 in mulakaaton main kya charchaa hui, yah pataa nahin lag paaya
 After this Venkaiah Naidu also reached Advani's house
 adwani se milane ke baad venkaiya ne kaha ki aisa kuch nahin hoga, jisase party ko nuksaan ho
 He told that he has appealed to Advani and everything will be alright
 haalanki is mudde par aresas bhi adwani kaa saath chodta najar aa rahaa he
 The Sangh has said that if Advani's seat is changed, it will send a wrong message, so he should contest from Gandhinagar itself
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki adwani madhya pradesh ke bhopal se chunaav ladanaa chaahate the, lekin buudhvaar ko bijepi ne unhen gandhinagar se ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya

 The meeting lasted for about 45 minutes
 adwani se mulaakaat ke baad sushamaa or gadakari rajnath se mili or adwani kii naaraazgi se avgat karaayaa
 In the day-long meeting of the bjp's Central Election Committee, the decision was taken after deliberating on Advani's case and from this meeting Advani remained absent saying that he would be involved in the ongoing discussion on the matter related to his constituency Did not want to
 sutron ke mutabik, adwani ne party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko sandesh bhijwa diya tha ki vah aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav gandhinagar kii bajaay bhopal se ladanaa chaahate hai
 However, he has represented Gandhinagar seat five times in the Lok Sabha
 adwani is baat par ade hue the ki unhen kai anya netaaon kii tarah apni pasand ke nirvachan kshetra kaa chunaav karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie kyonki kai anya netaaon ko bhi unki pasandida siten di gai hai
 Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav seems to have taken a soft approach towards Pakistan
 mulaayam singh ke mutabik china hamaara pani roak rahaa he jabaki pakistan chote bhai ke samaan he
 Mulayam Singh said these things at a convocation of a private university in Moradabad on Wednesday
 mulaayam singh ne apane bhaashan me kaha, 'seemaa par aaj desh kii kya haalat he
 China is our old adversary
 wo pani roak rahaa he

 Akshay Kumar's much anticipated film Padman is being released next week i
e
 9 February under the direction of r Balki
 ye film ek saadhaaran vyakti ke asaadhaaran mishan kii kahani he
 Her mission is about the sanitary napkins associated with women's hygiene, this issue is not talked about openly in most of the Indian society even today
 haalanki akshay kii film or haal hi main sainitory napkin ko GST ke daayre main laane ke baad se is par charchaa kii ja rahi he
 Actually, the main reason for discussing the sanitary napkin apart from the film is because of the 12% GST imposed on it by the central government
 dilli hoicourt ne bhi sarkaar se sawaal kar poocha tha ki jab bindi, sindur, kaajal ko tex free rakhaa he to phir sainitory pad par GST kyon lagaaya he?mahila sanghathanon or kai celibrities ne sarkaar ke is kadam kii aalochana kii thi
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is going to present the Union Budget of 2018, although the GST Council will take a final decision on GST, but women can expect some concession from Jaitley
 vaise pedman main mukhya bhoomika nibhaa rahe akshay kumaar lagaataar GST hataane kii maang karte aa rahe hai
 Akshay's film portrays a lot of questions about sanitary napkins and the thinking of society about sanitary
 akshay ne DU main laharaaya ABVP kaa jhanda, yugers ne kaha-ye baat samaj nahin isanitory pads ko lekar kya kehete hai pedman?akshay kumaar ne kaha tha, 'ye bilkul free hone chahie
 Cut 5% from the defense and make a bomb less
 lekin mahilaon ko ye paisa sainitory napkin kharidne ke liye den
 Akshay has often demanded that sanitary pads be made track free
 unka kahana he ki agar film ke jariye 5% mahilaayein bhi jaagruk ho jaati hai to ham ye jang jeet jaaenge
 Why government initiatives on sanitary napkins need only 12% of India's 355 million women use sanitary pads during periods
 88% mahilaayein periods ke dauraan sainitory pad kii bajaay gande kapade, raakh, ret or paper kaa istemaal karti hai
 According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 2015-16 report, 48 in the villages
 5% or shaharon main 77
 5% of women use pads
 jabaki 23 fisadi ladkiyaan periods ke chalate skool chhod detii hai

 chhattisgarh main hadataali shikshakarmiyon or sarkaar ke bich tana tani bad gai he
 After returning from a three-day tour of Delhi and Gujarat, as soon as Chief Minister Raman Singh registered his arrival in the capital Raipur, he took stock of the condition of government schools
 afasaron se charchaa kii or talakhi bhare andaaj main shikshakarmiyon ko aade haath liya
 Raman Singh said that like government teachers, there will not be any condition of education workers in any condition

 According to him, the committee is also considering all the legitimate demands of education workers
 lekin shikshakarmi lakhon chaatro ke bhavishya se khilwaad karte hue bemuddat hadtaal par chale gaye hai
 After this statement of the Chief Minister, the leader of the Education Union has called the government's stand as dictatorial
 andeshaa jaahir kiya ja rahaa he ki mukhyamantri raman singh kii talkhi ke baad pradesh main shikshakarmiyon kii barkhaastagi main teji aegi
 In Chhattisgarh, after the strike of education workers, education and teaching in government schools is being stopped
 naukari jwine karne se pehle kisi bhi hadtaal or pradarshan main hissaa nahin lene kaa halafanama die jane ke baavjood lagbhag dedh lakh shikshakarmi bemuddat hadtaal par chale gaye hai

 samaan vetan or samaan kaary kaa mudda uthaakar shikshakarmi sarkari shikshakon ke baraabar vetan bhatton kii maang kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, to prevent the education system coming to a standstill, in some areas the officers of the education department have entrusted the task of writing education to the peons of the school
 wo bhi baqayada sarkari order jari kar
 However, this order was also repealed immediately after the ruckus
 lekin chaparaasiyon se shaikshanik kaary lene kii anumati vaala aadesh jari hone se shiksha vibhaag kii tikhi aalochana ho rahi he
 On the other hand, the education worker is ready to give two hands to the government
 unhone saaf kar diya he ki bhale hi sarkaar unhen barkhaast kar de
 But they will not bow down
 apni maang puri karaae bagaiyr ve skool nahin lautenge

 There may be a coup in Pakistan once again
 ye ham nahin kah rahe hai balki isaki ashanka jataai he purv pakistani raashtrapati parvej musharraf ne
 According to Musharraf, Pakistan is standing at such a point of corruption and corruption where the army can overthrow the government under pressure
 pakistani raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari kii jid or pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani kii naakaami ke baad sena chif ashfak kiyani ne takhtapalat kii chetavanee di he
 At the same time, the political plans of former President Musharraf, the Taliban raising the head again and the economy ruined by the flood are also giving messages of a coup in Pakistan
 ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki kangaali ke muhane par khadey pakistan main kabhi bhi takhtapalat ho saktaa he
 Army can re-occupy power in Pakistan
 or phir se pakistan main bagdor tham sakati he sena
 In view of the latest situation in Pakistan, and former London President Pervez Musharraf has given a warning of coup in his own country
 taliban abhi bhi kai ilaakon main majboot bana hua he or paak sena ke saath-saath nato par bhi hamalaa bol rahaa he
 The attack on the oil tanker of the NATO army going to Afghanistan is a proof of the growing strength of the Taliban
 ek pakistani channel ke mutabik britain main rah rahe parvej musharraf ne kaha he ki pakistan main bhrashtachar or bhai bhatijawad haaavee he
 Army Chief Ashfaq Kayani may intervene to remove unpopular President Asif Ali Zardari
 landan main musharif kaa ye bayaan aayaa he 27 sitambar ko kayaani kii jaradaari or yusuf raja gilaani se mulaakaat ke baad
 Kayani is believed to have warned the government in clear terms that he should work on his own, tighten corruption and expedite efforts to tackle the floods
 musharraf ne kaha he ki aap kayaani, jaradaari or gilaani kii baithak kii tasveeron ko dekhen or main aapako yakeen dilaa saktaa hum ki ve mausam par guftgu nahin kar rahe the
 This was a serious discussion and there would be all kinds of pressure on the Army Chief at this time
 navaj sharif sarkaar ke takhtapalat se pehle mere upar bhi aisa hi dabaav tha
 Pakistan is still reeling from the worst floods of the century
 saath hi pakistan kii aarthik taur par bhi badahaali ke daur se guzar rahaa he
 The trust of the common citizen is getting eroded from the government and Musharraf has also prepared his new political party All Pakistan Muslim League in London
 tamaam halaat or paristhitiyon ko gaur se dekhne par saaf pataa chal rahaa he ki pakistan dhire-dhire takhtapalat kii ore sarak rahaa he
 Anyway, the history of Pakistan is also testifying to this
 pakistan ke log aarthik badahaali se tang aa chuke hai
 The entire country has been reeling under the biggest floods for the last several months which broke the backbone of the economy
 mana ja rahaa he ki vahaan ke log iske liye maujuuda sarkaar ko jimmevaar maanate hai or nijaat chaahate hai
 The air of power conversion through the coup in Pakistan has warmed
 baadh kaa kahar or taliban kaa koharaam pakistan ko khokhla karata ja rahaa he

 khabaron kii maane to sena pramukh kayaani ne bhi asainik sarkaar main pherbadal kii maang kii he
 The Taliban has become a canker for Pakistan, but the wound that has hurt Pakistan the most in the last few days is the severe floods and the government's failure to deal with it
 mana ja rahaa he ki sadi ke sabase khatarnaak baadh ke baad sarkaar kii khokhli arthvyavastha desh ko takhtapalat ke muhane tak le ai he

 Arun Jaitley, one of the bjp's top leaders and very close to the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, is embroiled in a fierce fight with veteran Congress leader and former Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh in his first Lok Sabha election in Amritsar
 raajnneeti ke in do mahaarathiyon kii takkar par sabaki nazaren lagi hai or is chunaav main banaras, lakhanu, amethi kii hi tarah amritsar seat par ladaai bhi behad dilachasp ho gai he
 Though Amritsar seat has traditionally been in the Congress's court, but since 2004 Navjot Singh Sidhu of BJP has been continuously winning from here, but he is not able to track his party with Akali Dal, bjp's ally in the state
 lihaaza is baar bijepi ne siddhu ke bajaae arun jetali ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 Unhappy with the Akalis, Sidhu is not campaigning in his constituency, while he has a very good personal relationship with Jaitley, although his wife Navjot Kaur, a BJP MLA from Amritsar, is definitely seeking votes for Jaitley
 vaise, jetali ko chunaav ladane ke liye kai siton kaa suzav diya gaya tha jinamein jammu, nai dilli or jaipur jaisi siten shaamil hai
 However, Jaitley decided to contest from Amritsar due to a personal request from the Akali Dal chief Sardar Parkash Singh Badal
 unki jaden punjab main hi hai or isiilie vah khud ko bahari ummidavaar bataane vaale congress ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hai
 a victory was won for Jaitley on the Amritsar seat, but only then the Congress fielded Captain Amarinder Singh from here
 khud captain amritsar se chunaav ladane ke icchhuk nahin the
 He wanted to give more time to his area in Patiala
 jahaan se unki patni loksabhaa kaa chunaav lard rahi hai
 But the Congress strategy was to surround Jaitley in Amritsar itself, so Captain agreed to contest from there at the behest of Sonia Gandhi herself
 captain amarinder singh ke mukaable main utarane se amritsar kii ladaai kaante kii ho gai kyonki vah jetali ke saath-saath apane paramparaagat virdohi akali dal par bhi nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 That is why the election of Amritsar has been linked to Jaitley's reputation as well as the Akali Dal
 is loksabhaa seat kii nau vidhansabha siton main se chah bijepi-akali gathbandhan ke paas he
 The Akali Dal has a strong hold on rural areas
 vahaan kii chaar vidhansabha siton main se teen akali dal ke paas he
 While two of the city's six are with the BJP and one Akali Dal
 akali dal kaa samarthan milane se gramin ilaakon main jetali ko badhat milane kii sambhaavna he
 While maintaining this edge in urban areas is a big challenge for them
 shaharon main akali dal ke prati naaraazgi saaf dikhaai de rahi he kyonki log buniyadi suvidhaayen na milane or tex badaye jane se naaraaz hai
 While, like Jaitley, Captain Amarinder Singh is facing accusations of being outsiders
 shaharon main akali dal ke prati gusse kaa phayda chaahe unhen mil rahaa he lekin mahangaai or bhrashtachar ko lekar upie sarkaar ke prati naaraazgi bhi unhen baari pad rahi he
 The Captain is also accused that his background as king-maharaja keeps him from getting mixed with common people
 ummidavaar ghoshit hone ke baad se captain zyaada vakt amritsar main nahin guzaara he jabaki jetali ne bahari ummidavaar kaa thappa mitaane ke liye amritsar main hi ghar bhi kharid liya he or wo yahaan khunta gaad kar baith gaye hai
 The BJP is also looking to take advantage of Narendra Modi's charisma in the urban areas of Amritsar
 abhi tak modi ne punjab main sirf ek hi chunavi raily kii he
 On April 24, he will rally in Amritsar in support of Jaitley
 bijepi ko bharosa he ki uske baad shahari ilaakon main matadaata jetali ke samarthan main jutenge
 The leaders of the Akali Dal and BJP are seeking votes in his favor, saying that Jaitley has got a big responsibility in the possible NDA government
 bijepi main jetali kaa bada kad unke paksh main ja rahaa he
 While raising the issue of displacement of Sikh farmers in Gujarat, Captain Amarinder is busy bringing sixty five percent of Sikh voters in this Lok Sabha seat
 is tarah amritsar seat par do sarkaron ke virodh kaa rujhaan dikh rahaa he
 Against the functioning of the Congress-led UPA government at the Center and the Akali dal-bjp government in the state
 yahi rujhaan jetali or captain donon kii chunautiyaan badha rahaa he kyonki iske chalate matadaataaon kaa mood bhaanpane main dikkat ho rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has fielded well-known local eye doctor Dr
 Daljit Singh, who is making inroads in the votes of both Congress and BJP
 isiilie amritsar main do diggajon kii ye ladaai behad dilachasp ho gai he
 The Swaraj Abhiyan, which has been opposing the liquor shops opened by the Kejriwal government in Delhi for the past several days and the liquor policy of the Delhi government, has mobilized to protest against the liquor contracts in the areas of Delhi
 pichley kuch dinon se artiai ke jariye dilli sarkaar kii sharaab niti kaa virodh karne vaali swaraj abhiyaan ab janata kaa samarthan lekar sadak par utar ai he
 Swaraj Abhiyan campaigned against open-air contracts in the residential area of wazirpur Kotla Mubarak
 kotla mubarakapur ke nivaasiyon se sathswaraj abhiyaanke netaaon ne is sharaab ke theke ko band karne kii maang kii
 During the public hearing, the Swaraj campaign made the following demands from the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi
 itane gambhir mudde par, itane chaunkaane vaale khulaase hone ke baad bhi dilli kii aam aadmi party sarkaar ke paas naa hi koi khandan, naa hi koi safai
 The government breaks its silence
 2
 The total consumption of alcohol from all categories of contracts should be accurately informed, and the reasons for overcoming the intoxication should be given
 3
 In the residential areas, open liquor contracts should be removed against the wishes of the local people within the stipulated time
 swaraj abhiyaan is muhim ko andolan kaa rup degaa
 4
 dilli sarkaar swaraj bill main yah praavdhaan kare ki sharaab ke theke kholane ke liye sthaneey nivaasiyon (50% mahila) kii ijaajat lenaa anivaary ho
 Also, the decision to get old liquor contracts closed should be in the hands of local residents, especially women
 5
 The Central Prohibition Department of the Delhi government has only 7 advertisements on abstaining from alcohol
 76 (lakh) rupee kharch kiye
 The details of this expenditure are also not available with the government
 swaraj abhiyaan yah maang karata he ki is raashi ko badhaayaa jaae or iskaa vistrut byoraa uplabdh karaayaa jaae
 Government should show commitment to its election promises to make Delhi drug-free
 6
 Before the Government of Delhi decides its next excise policy, the policy's draft should be made public for discussion and suggestions
 swaraj abhiyaan ke anupam ne kaha ki aaj hamen yah pran lenaa he ki jab tak vajeeranagar kaa yah theka nahin hataaya jaataa, is muhim ko jari rakhte hue anjaam tak pahunchaaya jayega
 Prashant Bhushan said during public hearing that according to the National Crime Record, alcohol is the biggest factor in all atrocities against women in the country
 rihaayshi ilaakon main 100 meter ke daayre main sharaab kaa theka nahin khole jane ke kanoon ko 2010 main sarkaar ne badal daalaa tha
 He said that a policy was made under the Swaraj Bill in the early days of the Aam Aadmi Party
