 Now if no councilor pays attention, then why should officers care
 east emsidi kii meyar naraj hai, vajah he ki parshad apane ilaake main naalon kii safai ko lekar sakriy nahin hai, yahaan tak ki meyar ne jo states report maangi thi wo bhi parshadon ne nahin di
 MCD East Mayor Annapurna Mishra says, "not a single councilor has given me the report, now you don't know why you ask them, they had asked them about cleaning the drains, they can tell, i have information No, if i visit, i will tell you ’naalon kii safai ke liye meyar ne 15 june kii dedline tay kii thi or parshadon se poocha tha ki unke ward main naalon kii safai kii kya haalat he
 But the councilors are giving their own arguments, they say that the officers do not listen to them
 parshad priti kahati hai, ‘hamaari afasar sunate nahin he, peedblyoody ke naale hai wo adhikari baat nahin karte hai, aise main badi mushkil ho gai he
 'councilors have their own excuses, but the ground reality is that the work of draining mud from drains is happening less on the ground and more on papers
 yun to parshad house main hangaamaa karte hai or naalon kii safai nahin hone par shor bhi machaate hai, lekin hakeekat ye he ki baat jab states report dene kii aayi, to ek bhi parshad ne nahin di

 But we cannot give them credit for reducing the prices of crude oil
 unhone teen saal tak fasalon ke emspi main badhotaree nahin kii
 The farmers were very upset

 Steps are treated in the budget for 50 percent of the population
 iske jawaab main chidambaram ne kaha, 'ham isiilie minimum inakam saport kaa bold idia laa rahe hai, jise sarkaar main aane par ham sambhav banaaenge
 He said that the schemes like the Raitu Bandhu scheme are going on now are only benefiting the owners of the farm land

 Chidambaram said, "then the price of crude oil reached $ 147 per barrel
 ham kya kar sakate the
 To deal with such a big problem after coming to the government, we have to resort to subsidies, could we pass the burden on the entire price to the customers, could we sell petrol and diesel for Rs 100 a liter? Said- UPA and UPA 2 had a difference in social spending, do you regret it? ' P
 in response to this
 chidambaram ne kaha, 'tab ham bhugtan santulan sankat, chaalu khate ke ghate ke sankat, vittiya ghaataa ke maamle main bade sankat kaa saamana kar rahe the, isliye jidipi ke pratishat ke lihaaj se saamaajik kharchon main kami ai

 Today, exports are sluggish and do not contribute to the growth of the economy
 export badhaane ke liye vyapak ranneeti banani hogi
 We have to make the country a manufacturing hub and also contribute to its exports
 ham software or paramparaagat niryaat jaise james-jwalairi, textile aadi main achche hai
 But manufacturing sector exports will have to increase
 hamaare export kaa 50 fisadi esemai se aata he, lekin ve final guds nahin banaate
 India's manufacturing sector does not do large exports except automobiles

 This government's GDP number is fake, CMIE MD and CEO Mahesh Vyas asked, "if the government says that there is a growth of 7% in the country, then where is the criticism of job growth, underdevelopment, etc

 In the morning, lukewarm water is very beneficial for health and if mixed with a little black salt, it acts like a panacea
 aaie jaane, roj subah namak vaala pani pine ke ye 3 phaayde
 
 
 1
 motaape se raahjhagar niyamit rup se subah pani main kaala namak milakar piya jaae to isse blad sugar, blad pressure, motopa or anya tarah kii bimariyon main raahat milti he
 But while taking salt water, keep in mind that you do not have to use plain salt in it
 2
 Healthy salt water placed on the stomach helps to activate the enzymes that digest the natural salt, hydrochloric acid and protein inside the stomach, so that the food eaten is easily digested and broken down
 iske alaawalivar main bhi anzimako sakriy hone main madad milti he, jisase khaanaa pachne main aasaani hoti he
 3
 anindra kii samasya ko kare doobgar aap neend kii samasya se pareshaan he to namak vaale pani kaa seven karen
 The minerals present in it help calm the nervous system
 namak, cortisol or edranline, jaise khatarnaak stress hormone ko kam kar raat ko acchhee neend laane main madad karata he
 Use of cosmetics is very common and there are many products in every house which seem to be every person of the house
 aksar aisi chizon kaa upyog twachaa ko nikhaarane or khubasurat dikhne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 But this does not happen, in fact, these products are harmful to your skin and body
 aaie jaane, aise hi kuch hanikaarak saundarya prasadhano ke bare main
 
 
 1
 lip glos:lip bom yaa lip glos sirf ladkiyaan hi nahin ladke bhi yuj karte hai
 Avoid its excessive use as it contains many oils and chemicals which removes the moisture of the lips
 hairaani hogi aapako ye jaanakar ki lipaglos main paaya janaa vaala mineral oil twachaa ke chhidron ko band kar detaa he jisase nai koshikaayen banane main dikkat aati he
 2- Perfume: bhini-bhini fragrance coming from the body also smells to the surrounding environment but do you know that very harmful chemicals are used in these products
 khushboo ke liye dio kaa yuj karnaa bhi thik nahin
 They contain aluminum, which causes sweat glands to close
 isse allergy hone kii sambhaavna bhi ho sakati he
 3
 hair daai:baalo ko daai karne ke liye jahaan tak ho sake to natural chizon kaa hi istemaal karen
 Hair dye contains many harmful chemicals that spoil hair and can also cause itching and burning problems in the scalp
 4
 Nail-paint: If you are fond of applying nail-paint, then think a hundred times because applying it can brighten your nails and cause spots
 nail-paint main asitone hota he, jisase nakhun kamjor ho sakate hai
 5
 bleech kriim:bleech kriim istemaal na karne main hi bhalaai he kyonki isamen hydrocunon naamak chemical hota he jisase skin damege hoti he
 6
 telcome powder:telcome powder kaa bhi zyada istemaal na hi karen to acha kyonki isamen silicket hone se allergy or sankraman kii samasya ho sakati he

 Rajendra Pal Gautam, a Delhi government minister and leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, has spoken of confusing Muslim voters in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone kaha ki dilli kii sabhi saat loksabhaa siton par aam aadmi party ko jeet milane kii ummid kii ja rahi thi, lekin muslim voter ne kanfusion main vot daalaa, jiske chalate kuch voter congress kii taraf shift hua
 Apart from this, Rajendra Pal Gautam alleged that the money was distributed to the poor voters two nights before the vote, due to which the votes have been transferred
 rajendra paal gautam uttari-purvi dilli kii simapuri vidhansabha se vidhayak bhi hai
 Let us tell you that in the sixth phase on Sunday, May 12, the seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi were cast and the total turnout was 60
 52 fisadi record kiya gaya tha
 Out of the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi, the north-east Delhi Lok Sabha seat had the highest turnout
 yahaan par 63
 39 percent of the people exercised their franchise
 is loksabhaa kshetra main dilli kii sabase zyada muslim aabaadi he
 Muslims constitute around 23 per cent, with Muslim-majority areas such as Seelampur and Mustafabad
 uttari-purvi dilli loksabhaa seat se congress pratyaashee shila dikshit, bijepi pratyaashee manoj tiwari or aam aadmi party pratyaashee dilip pandeya ke bich muqabla he
 At the same time, apart from North East Delhi, the number of Muslim voters is also decisive in Chandni Chowk and East Delhi Lok Sabha seat
 chunaav prachaar main aap mukhiya arvind kejariwal lagaataar vot na bantane kii apil kar rahe the
 The AAP was hoping that it would get a one-sided vote against the Muslim community
 lekin voting ke baad charchaa ye rahi ki congress ke hisse bhi muslim samaaj kaa vot gaya he
 This discussion has now been confirmed by Kejriwal's minister and said that Muslim voters voted in Confusion due to which Congress also got their vote
 AAP mantri rajendra paal gautam se exclusive sawaal-javabaisawaal - 12 may kii voting ke baad aam aadmi party kaa kya akalan he?jawaab -meri vidhansabha main kareeb 67% vot daalaa gaya he
 Apart from this, there was the effect of summer and Purvanchalis had weddings here, due to which they went to their village
 iske saath hi roje kaa asar bhi voting main dekhne ko mila
 However, despite this there was a good vote
 sawaal- kya uttari-purvi dilli loksabhaa seat main aam aadmi party ko vot mila yaa nahin? agar nahin mila, to kyon nahin mila?jawaab -uttari-purvi dilli loksabhaa seat main aam aadmi party ko bahut vot mila
 We also got some BJP votes, but our core voters have shifted towards Sheila Dixit and Congress
 isaki vajah chunaav se pehle kii 2 raat hai
 Two days before the election, we were winning unilaterally, but now the difference of victory can be up to a thousand instead of millions of votes
 sawaal- chunaav se pehle raat ko hue kis khel kii baat aap kar rahe hai?jawaab-hamen shikaayat mili he ki uttari-purvi dilli loksabhaa seat main raatbhar moti rakam banti gai
 After voting was over, the voters informed us about the distribution of money
 zyaadaatar garib logon ne paise lekar vot die, jis vajah se vot transfar hue
 Dilip Pandey will get good vote margin in Seemapuri Assembly of north-eastern Lok Sabha
 haalanki kai anya vidhansabhao main kaaten kii takkar he, jisaki vajah se jeet kaa antar ab kam hoga
 Question- Was it claimed to win seven seats, are seats falling in the assessment after voting? Answer - We were believing that the Aam Aadmi Party would get all seven seats, but people got confused while voting 
 khaastaur par muslim ne kanfusion main vot daalaa, jisaki vajah se kuch pratishat vot congress kii taraf shift hua he or saaton siton par jo jeetne kii ummid kar rahe the, wo kamjor hue he
 Now one or two seats out of seven may come
 sawaal - dilli main muslim vot bantane kii vajah kya he?jawaab -darasal logon ke bich ye kanfusion failaayaa gaya ki dilli main arvind kejariwal or centre main narendra modi yaa rahul gandhi
 An attempt was made by the Congress to give this message
 ye massej voting se 2 din pehle failaayaa gaya or ham use pakad nahin paae, lekin ummid he ki 7 main se 5 siton par jarur jeetenge
 Question- Which seats are expected to win? Answer - i think we are winning both the seats across the Yamuna
 raghav chaddha kii south dilli loksabhaa seat or uttari pashchimi dilli loksabhaa seat par bhi jeet rahe hai
 However, there may be a collision between Chandni Chowk and New Delhi Lok Sabha
 sawaal- dilli sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa bahut prachaar kiya gaya, kya logon ne sarkaar ke kaam ko dekhakar vot nahin diya?jawaab-janata ne vot daalane ke baad khuleam kaha ki dilli ke kaam kaa koi muqabla nahin he or dilli vidhansabha main aam aadmi party ko hi jitaayenge, lekin ye loksabhaa kaa chunaav tha
 Question- Assembly elections will be held in Delhi soon, will the result of the Lok Sabha elections be affected then? Answer - This election will not have any effect in the Delhi Assembly elections
 haalanki raajnneeti main kuch bhi sthir nahin hota he
 The strategy has to change from time to time and the Aam Aadmi Party will churn on it
 agar saaton siton par jeet nahin milti he or sirf 5 seat hi jitate hai, to har booth main kitna vot padaa iskaa akalan karenge

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has expressed optimism about the arrival of the Pakistan team, but has said that it had to be done so why is it being done in only one case

 In a six-hour meeting between the two parties, all this information has been given to Pakistan
 pakistan ne in daavon ko na to thukraayaa he na galat bataaya he
 Sources have also told that permission will be sought from Pakistan to reach Masood Azhar
 sutron se pataa chalaa he ki bharat main pakistan kii team ko puure tareeke se jaanch karne di ja rahi he
 It is being claimed that India will also get such exemption in Pakistan

 In its report on com it is written that the court of India has written a letter to the court of Pakistan called letter-rogatory
 iske zariye bharat ne pakistan kii court se sabooton ko saajha kiye jane kii maang kii he
 Pakistan has also promised to share, but the Pakistan court has not yet sent a letter-rogatory to India, so the evidence gathered from here can be challenged
 ye kaha ja rahaa he ki pakistan ne pehali baar mana he ki uski zamin kaa istemaal hua he
 After the Mumbai attack, on 13 February 2009, Pakistan's Home Minister Rehman Malik, during a press conference, admitted that Pakistan's land was partially used for the Mumbai attack and caught some suspects against whom criminal prosecution has been started
 is
 lekin pakistan kii sarkaar un sabake kilaaf bhi apni adaalaton main sabit nahin kar pai
 The evidence given by India regarding the Mumbai attacks was also not accepted in the Adiala court in Rawalpindi
 lihaaza hafiz said lahore court se or zakiur rahamaan lakhvi adiyaala court se reeha ho gaya
 In the Pathankot case too, Pakistan has not named anyone in the FIR registered, while India considers Masood Azhar as the main accused for this attack
 kya hoga agar pakistan kii team laut kar yah kah de ki hamen jo saboot dikhaaye gaye wo paryaapt nahin he tab bharat kya karegaa
 It is true that the Indian team has got a chance to present its evidence in front of the Pakistan team too
 chaar saal pehle bharat kii jaanch agency ne david hedli se america jaakar poochtacha kii thi
 Still, his testimony is recorded here only through video link from USA

 The comments ai es ai kaa adhikari hone ke kaaran yah daura raajnneetik virodh kaa kaaran ban rahaa he yaa pakistani team ke kaaran hi
 Now the question is whether Pakistan will allow India to interrogate from Hafiz Saeed to Masood Azhar
 bharat kahata he ki vah maang karegaa
 All this was happening when the Public Relations Agency of Pakistan Army released a video in another case
 is video main kulbhushan jadhav sweekaar kar rahe hai ki wo ro ke liye kaam karte hai
 Lt
 General Asim Bajwa and Information Minister Pervez Rasheed were present in this press conference
 bajva ne kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav RAW chif, neshnal security adwiser or RAW joint secretary se sidhe taur par sampark main tha
 Through Jadhav, Pakistan's military officer alleged that this is a type of state-sponsored terrorism and what would be the clearest evidence that India is interfering in Pakistan
 usne bataaya he ki wo ab bhi bhartiya nausena main karyrat he or 2022 ko ritair hoga
 He told that RAW joined him in 2013 and since then he has been doing a lot of activities in Karachi and Bluechistan as the RAW said
 karachi main kanoon or vyavastha bigaadane kii koshish main rahaa
 The Defense Minister of India has admitted that Kulbhushan Jadhav is a former Navy officer, but has denied involvement in any intelligence activity on behalf of India
 raksha mantri ne kaha tha ki jadhav ko jo bhi madad kii zarurat hogi, di jaaegi
 The video was released at a time when the Pakistani investigation team is present in India and the opposition parties are making various allegations against the government
 haalanki donon maamle alag hai magar video ke zariye kaboolnamaa jari karne se ek baar vahi puraani ashankaayen jaagti to hai ki kya vaaki jaanch dal ke daure jaisi gatividhiyon se koi laabh hoga
 But the Congress Aam Aadmi Party and Shiv Sena have a reason why the Joint Investigation Team has been allowed inside the airbase
 mangalvaar ko teenon dalon ne vahaan aisa pradarshan kiya ki pakistani team ko kisi or darvaaze se bheetar le janaa padaa
 People of political parties protesting there were shouting slogans against the central government and wrote on the placards they had in their hands, go back to Pakistan JIT
 pradarshnakariyon ne kaale jhande bhi dikhaaye
 The Congress leader said that earlier these people came to attack our land, shed blood and now they are making excuses as if they had come for justice
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki hamaari bhartiya team ko pakistan bhejnaa chahie taaki masood ajahar kii bhoomika kii jaanch kar sake
 Will India be allowed to go there and investigate
 hamen dhyaan rakhana chahie ki bharat doshi nahin he
 Pakistan is guilty
 aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ne twit kiya he ki azaad desh ke itihaas main aisa kabhi nahin hua ki bharat kii sarkaar pakistan ke saamne itnaa jhuk jaae
 By calling the ISI, the Modi government succumbed to Pakistan
 centre ne shaheedon kii shahadat kii saudebaazi kii he jise bharat ke log bardaasht nahin karenge

 The video was released at a time when the Pakistani investigation team is present in India and the opposition parties are making various allegations against the government
 haalanki donon maamle alag hai magar video ke zariye kaboolnamaa jari karne se ek baar vahi puraani ashankaayen jaagti to hai ki kya vaaki jaanch dal ke daure jaisi gatividhiyon se koi laabh hoga
 It is being said that Pakistan has admitted for the first time that its land has been used
 mumbai hamale ke baad 13 farvari 2009 ko pakistan ke tabake grahamantri rahamaan malik ne press conference kar mana tha ki mumbai hamale ke liye pakistan kii zamin kaa aanshik taur par istemaal kiya gaya or kuch sandigdhon ko pakadaa bhi he jinke khilaaf aapraadhik mukadmaa shuru kar diya gaya he
 But the government of Pakistan could not prove them even in their courts
 bharat ne mumbai hamalon se jude jo saboot die the ve bhi rawalpindi ke adiyaala court main nahin sweekaar nahin kiye gaye
 So Hafiz Saeed was released from Lahore Court and Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi from Adiala Court
 pathankot maamle main bhi pakistan ne jo epa ai aar darj kii he usamen kisi kaa naam nahin liya he jabaki bharat is hamale ke liye masood azhar ko mukhya aaropee maanata he
 What if Pakistan's team returns and says that the evidence shown to us is not enough then what India will do
 yah sahi he ki pakistan kii team ke saamne bhartiya team ko bhi apane saboot rakhane kaa mauka mila he wo bhi aamane-saamne
 Four years ago, the Indian investigative agency interrogated David Headley in the United States
 abhi bhi america se video link ke zariye hi uski gavaahi yahaan ricard kii jaati he
 If seen in this way, America should not have allowed the Indian agency to interrogate David Headley
 tippaniyan Being an ISI officer, the tour is causing political opposition or due to the Pakistani team
 ab sawaal he ki kya pakistan bharat ko hafiz said se lekar masood azhar tak se poochtacha karne degaa
 India says it will demand
 yah sab ho rahaa tha tabhi ek anya maamle main pakistan kii sena kii jansampark agency ne ek video jari kar diya
 In this video, Kulbhushan Jadhav is admitting that he works for Raw
 is press conference main leftinent general aseem bajva or soochna mantri parvaiz raashid maujuud the
 Bajwa said that Kulbhushan Jadhav was in direct contact with RAW Chief, National Security Advisor and RAW Joint Secretary
 jadhav ke zariye pakistan ke sainik adhikari ne aarope lagaaya ki ye ek kism kaa rajya dwaara pryojit aatankwaad he or isse zyada saaf saboot kya hoga ki bharat kaa pakistan main dakhal he
 He has stated that he is still working in the Indian Navy and will retire on 2022
 usne bataaya ki RAW ne use 2013 main apane saath joda or tabase wo karachi or bluechistan main RAW ke kahe anusaar kai activities karata rahaa
 Law and order in Karachi tried to spoil
 bharat ke raksha mantri ne yah to mana he ki kulbhushan jadhav purv navy afasar he, lekin bharat kii taraf se kisi bhi khufia gatividhi main shaamil hone se inkaar kiya he
 The Defense Minister had said that Jadhav would be given whatever help he needed
 ye video us samay jari kiya gaya jab pakistani jaanch dal bharat main maujuud he or virdohi dal sarkaar par tarah tarah ke aarope laga rahe hai
 Though the two cases are different, the release of confession through video once raises the same old apprehensions as to whether there will be any benefit from activities such as visiting the investigation team
 lekin pakistan kii sarkaar un sabake kilaaf bhi apni adaalaton main sabit nahin kar pai
 The evidence given by India regarding the Mumbai attacks was also not accepted in the Adiala court in Rawalpindi
 lihaaza hafiz said lahore court se or zakiur rahamaan lakhvi adiyaala court se reeha ho gaya
 In the Pathankot case too, Pakistan has not named anyone in the FIR registered, while India considers Masood Azhar as the main accused for this attack
 kya hoga agar pakistan kii team laut kar yah kah de ki hamen jo saboot dikhaaye gaye wo paryaapt nahin he tab bharat kya karegaa
 It is true that the Indian team has got a chance to present its evidence in front of the Pakistan team too
 chaar saal pehle bharat kii jaanch agency ne david hedli se america jaakar poochtacha kii thi
 Still, his testimony is recorded here only through video link from USA
 is tarah se dekha jaae to america ko david hedli se poochtacha karne ke liye bhartiya agency ko anumati hi nahin deni chahie thi
 The comments ai es ai kaa adhikari hone ke kaaran yah daura raajnneetik virodh kaa kaaran ban rahaa he yaa pakistani team ke kaaran hi
 Now the question is whether Pakistan will allow India to interrogate from Hafiz Saeed to Masood Azhar
 bharat kahata he ki vah maang karegaa
 All this was happening when the Public Relations Agency of Pakistan Army released a video in another case
 is video main kulbhushan jadhav sweekaar kar rahe hai ki wo ro ke liye kaam karte hai
 Lt
 General Asim Bajwa and Information Minister Pervez Rasheed were present in this press conference
 bajva ne kaha ki kulbhushan jadhav RAW chif, neshnal security adwiser or RAW joint secretary se sidhe taur par sampark main tha
 Through Jadhav, Pakistan's military officer alleged that this is a type of state-sponsored terrorism and what would be the clearest evidence that India is interfering in Pakistan
 usne bataaya he ki wo ab bhi bhartiya nausena main karyrat he or 2022 ko ritair hoga
 He told that RAW joined him in 2013 and since then he has been doing a lot of activities in Karachi and Bluechistan as the RAW said
 karachi main kanoon or vyavastha bigaadane kii koshish main rahaa
 The Defense Minister of India has admitted that Kulbhushan Jadhav is a former Navy officer, but has denied involvement in any intelligence activity on behalf of India
 raksha mantri ne kaha tha ki jadhav ko jo bhi madad kii zarurat hogi, di jaaegi
 The video was released at a time when the Pakistani investigation team is present in India and the opposition parties are making various allegations against the government
 haalanki donon maamle alag hai magar video ke zariye kaboolnamaa jari karne se ek baar vahi puraani ashankaayen jaagti to hai ki kya vaaki jaanch dal ke daure jaisi gatividhiyon se koi laabh hoga
 What if Pakistan's team returns and says that the evidence shown to us is not enough then what India will do
 yah sahi he ki pakistan kii team ke saamne bhartiya team ko bhi apane saboot rakhane kaa mauka mila he wo bhi aamane-saamne
 Four years ago, the Indian investigative agency interrogated David Headley in the United States
 abhi bhi america se video link ke zariye hi uski gavaahi yahaan ricard kii jaati he
 If seen in this way, America should not have allowed the Indian agency to interrogate David Headley
 tippaniyan Being an ISI officer, the tour is causing political opposition or due to the Pakistani team
 ab sawaal he ki kya pakistan bharat ko hafiz said se lekar masood azhar tak se poochtacha karne degaa
 India says it will demand
 yah sab ho rahaa tha tabhi ek anya maamle main pakistan kii sena kii jansampark agency ne ek video jari kar diya
 In this video, Kulbhushan Jadhav is admitting that he works for Raw
 is press conference main leftinent general aseem bajva or soochna mantri parvaiz raashid maujuud the
 Bajwa said that Kulbhushan Jadhav was in direct contact with RAW Chief, National Security Advisor and RAW Joint Secretary
 jadhav ke zariye pakistan ke sainik adhikari ne aarope lagaaya ki ye ek kism kaa rajya dwaara pryojit aatankwaad he or isse zyada saaf saboot kya hoga ki bharat kaa pakistan main dakhal he
 He has stated that he is still working in the Indian Navy and will retire on 2022
 usne bataaya ki RAW ne use 2013 main apane saath joda or tabase wo karachi or bluechistan main RAW ke kahe anusaar kai activities karata rahaa
 Law and order in Karachi tried to spoil
 bharat ke raksha mantri ne yah to mana he ki kulbhushan jadhav purv navy afasar he, lekin bharat kii taraf se kisi bhi khufia gatividhi main shaamil hone se inkaar kiya he
 The Defense Minister had said that Jadhav would be given whatever help he needed
 ye video us samay jari kiya gaya jab pakistani jaanch dal bharat main maujuud he or virdohi dal sarkaar par tarah tarah ke aarope laga rahe hai
 Though the two cases are different, the release of confession through video once raises the same old apprehensions as to whether there will be any benefit from activities such as visiting the investigation team
 ai es ai kaa adhikari hone ke kaaran yah daura raajnneetik virodh kaa kaaran ban rahaa he yaa pakistani team ke kaaran hi
 Now the question is whether Pakistan will allow India to interrogate from Hafiz Saeed to Masood Azhar
 bharat kahata he ki vah maang karegaa
 All this was happening when the Public Relations Agency of Pakistan Army released a video in another case
 is video main kulbhushan jadhav sweekaar kar rahe hai ki wo ro ke liye kaam karte hai
 Lt
 General Asim Bajwa and Information Minister Pervez Rasheed were present in this press conference

 He told that RAW joined him in 2013 and since then he has been doing a lot of activities in Karachi and Bluechistan as the RAW said
 karachi main kanoon or vyavastha bigaadane kii koshish main rahaa
 The Defense Minister of India has admitted that Kulbhushan Jadhav is a former Navy officer, but has denied involvement in any intelligence activity on behalf of India
 raksha mantri ne kaha tha ki jadhav ko jo bhi madad kii zarurat hogi, di jaaegi

 The Modi government at the Center on Tuesday decided to end the Haj subsidy
 faisla isi saal se lagu hoga
 All the arguments are being made in favor and opposition about this, then politics has also started
 haalanki, haj sabsidi khatm karne kii shuruyaat 2012 main supreme court ke ek faisle se hui thi
 The UPA government had begun to end this in a phased manner and now the Modi government has completely eliminated it in one stroke
 muslim samudaay ke log isaki maang lambey arase se karte aa rahe hai
 Know what was the logic behind this and what was the history of Haj subsidy in the country
 haj sabsidi kii aise hui thi shuruyatazadee ke baad 1954 tak mumbai kii mughal shipping company ke jahaajon se hi haj yatri jate the
 But Haj pilgrimage started in 1954 by air
 lekin ab bhi badi sankhya main yatri samudri maarg hi jate the
 After the Gulf War in the 1960s, then the formation of the oil exporting countries OPEC, fuel costs increased and in 1973 after the accident of a ship carrying Haj pilgrims in 1973, the government decided that now the Haj pilgrims are only in Hawaii
 Will go by the route
 jahaaj yatra ruk jane se jairinon par jo atirikt kharch badha usase raahat dilaane ke liye indira gandhi kii sarkaar ne hawaii yatra par sabsidi kii shuruyaat kii
 Who used to get subsidies Like the Muslims of the world, the Muslims of India also go to Saudi Arabia for Haj
 bhartiya hajiyon kii yatra ke kharch kaa kuch hissaa sarkaar sabsidi ke rup main khud vahan karti thi
 These subsidies were available only to the Haj pilgrims who went through the Haj Committee
 privet tour travel se jane vaale jairinon ko ye sabsidi nahin milti thi
 The Modi government also completely abolished this part of the Haj subsidy to Manglaver
 ab haj yatra puri tarah jairinon ke kharch par hogi
 The Vajpayee government did not end the subsidy
 It was Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government from 1998 to 2004
 is dauraan sansadeey cameti ne haj sabsidi khatm karne kii sifarish kii thi lekin iske baavjood ise sarkaar ne ise band nahin kiya
 In 2004, Congress coalition government was formed
 gauratlab he ki 2006 se hi videsh mantralay or parivahan or paryaton par bani ek sansadeey samiti ne haj sabsidi ko ek samay seemaa ke bheetar khatm karne ke suzav die the
 Despite this, the government did not abolish the Haj subsidy
 haj sabsidi ko khatm karne ke liye liye pilbawa den ki bean shukla or bijepi ke purv rajyasabhasadasy prafull goradia nesupreme court main PIL daayar kii, jisamen bharat sarkaar dwaara antarrashtriya yatra main di jane vaali haz sabsidi ko asanvaidhanik bataakar samaapt karke kaa aagrah kiya gaya tha
 The Surpeem Court said that in the context of Haj subsidy in 10 years, the Supreme Court ordered on 8 May 2012 that the Haj subsidy be discontinued
 2012 main court ne ise 10 saal kii samaysima main dhire-dhire khatm karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Since then, there has been a continuous reduction in subsidy from the government
 sarkaar dwaara jo paisa 2012 se pehle jari kiya jaataa tha
 It decreased year after year
 alpsankhyak kalyaan mantralay ke anusaar 2012 main 836
 Haj subsidy of Rs 55 crore was given
 iske baad se lagaataar sabsidi kaa boj sarkaar ke sir se kam hota gaya
 In the very next year, 2013, the central government cut it by more than one and a half crores to 680
 03 karod rupee kii sabsidi jari kii
 In 2017, only 250 crores on Haj subsidy, in 2014 more than 100 crores of this amount was reduced and subsidy 577
 07 karod rah gai
 In 2015, the subsidy decreased by about 50 crores
 ab ye rakam ghatakar 529
 51 crores
 2016 main 405 karod rupee bataur haj sabsidi ke rup main sarkaar ne die yani sabsidi kii rakam 836 se ghatakar kareeb aadhi rah gai
 According to news agency PTI, Haj subsidy of only 250 crores was given in 2017 and now in 2018 Modi government has completely abolished the Haj subsidy
 lagaataar bade jaayrinesarkaar ne bhale hi haj sabsidi khatm karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Despite this, there has been an increase in the number of zerines in the last few years
 1996 main jahaan 75346 haz yatri makka gaye the vahiin ye saal 2000 main ye aankada badhkar 113909 ho gaya
 In 2012, the number of Yehj passengers increased to 169961, but in 2013 it decreased to 135938
 saudi arab se sambandhon ke aadhaar par ye kota badhata ghatata rahaa he
 But after the arrival of Modi government, it gradually increased in the number of passengers again
 saal 2014 main haj yatriyon kii sankhya 135966 jo ki 2017 main badhkar 169940 ho gai
 This year 175,000 Zarine will go to Haj without subsidy from India
 iske alaava 1300 mahila haj yatri ne is baar akele (bina parivaar yaa pati ke) haj jane ke liye aavedan kiya tha jise manjuuri de di gai he
 Women officers will be there to help them and separate arrangements will be made for their stay / stay

 People alleged that special people go straight in by talking on the phone and since we are poor people, we are left in the bus line

 @explorawatersportsa post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif) onjul 21, 2017 at 12:57pm pdtbawa den ki haal main hi katrina or ranbir kapur kii film 'jagga jasoos' relies hui he jise logon ke milijule rispance mil rahe hai
 'tiger Zinda Hai' is a sequel to the 2012 film 'ek Tha Tiger' directed by Ali Abbas Zafar
 is film main salmaan ne ek ro agent kaa kirdaar nibhaayaa tha jabaki katrina film pakistani agent bani thim
 ranbir-katrina came together for the first time after the relationship broke, when the actress asked - You have come to PK? bihar main vikaas kii prakriya 1961 main tatkaaleen mukhyamantri shrikrishna singh kii mrityu ke baad thap pad gai thi
 We cannot just blame Lalu Prasad Yadav for the zero development of Bihar
 beshak unhone isamen yogadan diya or bihar ko nakaaratmakataa kii ore le gaye
 In fact, long before he took over power in the state in 1990, development was no longer the priority of the government
 alabatta lalu ne shashan ke khatme ko sunishchit karte hue kaarytantr ko hi nasht kar diya
 Bihar had six chief ministers in the eighties
 ve sabhi apni sarkaar kii sthirataa kii chintaa main hi lage rahe
 There was no development in his mind
 november, 2005 main nitish kumaar ke netritv main bani jad (you)-bhaajapa gathbandhan sarkaar chaar dashak se bhi adhik samay main pehali sarkaar thi jisaki sheersh praathamikta thiah shashan or vikaas
 We had a lot of problems in the beginning, because then there was hardly any system working in the state
 hamane bihar main kanoon ke raaj ko dobaaraa behaal karne se shuruyaat kii or rajya ko phir se sakaaratmak vikaas kii ore le gaye, chaahe vah vaastavik taur par ho yaa pratikatmak taur par
 This created an atmosphere of security for women and businessmen
 yahi donon varg kanoon hinata ke paaramparik rup se shikaar the
 The 2010 mandate symbolizes the approval of our efforts and the voters' resolve
 lekin ham koi khushrahmi nahin paalna chaahate
 Expectations from the government are high
 ham jaanate hai ki ummiido kii gati kai baar vikaas ke aankadon se bhi adhik ho jaati he
 Therefore, we also have a thought of fear of dissatisfaction of the people
 hamane chunautiyaan sweekaari hai
 What we need to do is clear
 bihar ko ek gatisheel rajya banane ke baad ab shashan ke agle str tak pahunchate hue sakaaratmak nattejey dene kii shuruyaat kerani he
 The Chief Minister has already fixed the target of making Bihar a developed state by 2015
 bihar hameshaa se krantiyon kii bhoomi rahaa he
 From the beginning of the first rebellion against the Congress in 1967 — leading to the first non-congress government in the state (along with some other states) —to the 1974 JP movement that overturned Indira Gandhi's government, Bihar has led to many positive changes
 
 main rajg sarkaar kii safalataa ko bhi isi tarah kii safal, lekin khamosh kranti maanata hum
 The 2010 mandate should also be seen as a hallmark of decisive social factors
 lalu ne kuch jatiyon kaa jo gathjod banaaya tha usamen kuch jatiyon kaa adhik dabadabaa tha
 Well, not surprisingly, many social groups felt marginalized
 shuru main congress ne bhi aisa hi saamaajik gathjod kiya tha, jiske nattejey main bahuterey log uske baahar chhitak gaye the
 Our success lies in forming a rainbow coalition by combining social groups that were considered to be conflicting
 ham apana saamaajik aadhaar vyapak kar sake, kyonki hamaare kaamkaaj ne ummiden jagaai thim
 We worked to empower women and extremely backward castes, who were left behind in the race for development
 sabko saath lekar chalane kii hamaari niti ne raajnneeti kaa swaroop hi badal diya
 Although it was difficult to implement, our seriousness and perseverance were successful
 kisi samooh ko choda nahin gaya
 The electoral impact of all this is now visible: the politics of empowerment has given the women of Bihar an independent identity of their own
 is janadesh kaa ek spasht rashtriya sandesh bhi he
 The era of emotional upheaval politics is over
 ab log kuch thos chaahate hai
 Perhaps the only viable political option is the model of Bihar's politics that takes everyone along
 matadaataaon kii nai peedi ne dekha he ki kis tarah duusare rajya vikaas kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, today people have access to internet and other information media, which tell what is happening around the world
 yah peedi keval bhavuk udgaaron se santusht nahin hoti
 The mandate confirms that voters are ready to support a government that works
 agar sarkaar samaveshi vikaas sunishchit karti he to sarkaar virodh kaa asar nahin hota
 The people of Bihar reassigned power to us, because they know that we do what we say
 is jeet kaa hamaare gathbandhan ke liye bhi vishesh arth he
 The NDA is overjoyed, as this victory has certainly enhanced its image
 yah jeet aise samay ai he, jab congress bhrashtachar ke apane daag se jujh rahi he
 The prevalence with which we got Muslim votes has changed the general perception about BJP and NDA
 yah hamaare gathbandhan ke liye nayaa chunavi sameekaran taiyaar kar saktaa he
 Those who had left us in the name of secularism, will now find that argument wrong
 jinhone ateet main hamaara saath choda, ve bhi ab laut sakate hai
 (modi is the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar) supreme court ke purv jaj markendeya katju ne ek baar phir apane blog ke jariye jajon ko kii chunane vaali vyavastha, yani colegium vyavastha par tikhi tippanee kii he
 Katju has written that the collegium system is an opaque system and many corrupt judges have been appointed through it, changes should be brought in this system immediately
 'aaj tak' se baat karte huejustise katjune tamaam sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Katju said that Justice Chelameswar has given the reason for not going to the meeting that the collegium meeting is opaque, only five people sit quietly and take decisions
 'aap meri peeth khujie, main aapaki peeth khujaaungaa'justise katju ne kaha he ki is vyavastha ke andar give and tech formula chalata he yani aap meraa kaam kariye, main aapaki madad karuunga
 Bargaining occurs here, you favor me, i will yours
 'kai bhrasht or kaamchor jaj chune gaye'katju ne kaha, 'is vyavastha se achche jaj nahi aa sakate
 This system has selected many corrupt and inept judges
 kerala ke ek kaamchor jaj ko colegium ke jariye chunaa gaya, virodh ke baavjood unako chun liya gaya
 "judges choose their relatives," Katju further said, that many judges choose their relatives as judges
 kai maamle aise aae hai, jab apane sage-sambandhiyon ko jaj priarity par chun lete hai or kai yogya logon ko peeche kar diya jaataa he
