 hinduon main saptaah kaa har din kisi na kisi dev ko samarpit he
 Everyday worship of any one deity or god is given importance
 isi tarah shanivaar kaa bhi din he
 But on this day some devotees have a slight confusion on one thing
 vah yah ki kuch log is din ko shani dev ke naam par manaate hai, to kuch ise hanuman kaa waar maanate hai
 After all, this war is in the name of which god
 is din kise poojana hindu dharm ke anusaar sahi he
 We tell you that due to the similarities between Shani and Hanuman in Hindu beliefs, worship of both is considered possible on this day- manyata ke anusaar shrihanuman rudra avatar hai or shanidev hi ek naam rudra he, to donon hi devon main samanta ke chalate bhi is din donon ko puja jaataa he
 Worshiping both the gods on Saturday is a right under Hinduism
 darasal surya samhita ke mutabik hanumanji kaa janm shanivaar ke din hua tha
 Therefore, his worship on this day is also not wrong
 shani ke pita surya hai
 And according to the belief, Surya is the guru of Hanuman
 yah sabhi maanate hai ki shani dev kaa apane pita se manmutav tha
 But Surya gave a fraction of his glory to Hanuman
 isse bhi donon ko surya kaa ansh mana ja saktaa he
 If Hanuman Sahastranam is seen then Shani is also given a name of the Hindu god Hanuman
 isliye is din donon kaa hi pujan maanya samajha jaataa he

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley called the 108 alleged economists accused of government interference in economic growth figures as fake
 arthshaastriyon kii aalochana karte hue unhone kaha ki ulti baaten karnaa inaki fitrat rahi he or ye maujuuda sarkaar ke khilaaf vibhinn muddon par raajnneetik ke tahat gadhe gaye gyapanon par kai baar hastakshar kar chuke hai

 Dismissing the arguments of these economists, 131 chartered accountants emphasized that India is on the path of high growth and completely dismissed the concern that there was a glut in economic data

 Jaitley said that one of the fake campaigns against the current government is a question on economic data
 unhone kaha, '108 kathith arthshaastriyon ke haal ke bayaan ke vishleshan kii jarurat he
 Most of them have repeatedly signed memorandums against the current government on politically fabricated issues for the last few years, they always talk back
 ' jetali ne kaha ki is baat kaa vishleshan karne kii jarurat he ki arthvyavastha ke sandarbh main desh aaj kahaan khadaa he
 Comparing the work of the current government and former governments on the economic front, he said that in the five years between 2014 and 2019, the GDP growth rate was the fastest than any other government, it has been a time of fiscal consolidation
 unhone kaha ki 5 saal main ausat GDP vruddhi dar 7
 5 percent which is the highest among the world's major economies
 vitt mantri ne kaha ki mudrasphiti vyapak taur par niyantran main he or rajkoshiya ghaataa dhire-dhire kam ho rahaa he
 Not only this, the percentage of debt taken from abroad as a GDP ratio has come down and the current account deficit situation has improved significantly

 team india ke sabase anbhavi tej gendbaajon main shumaar eshanth sharma ko team main shaamil kiye jane ko lekar phir sawaal khad ho rahe hai
 In view of his recent performance, his inclusion in the team is nothing less than an enigma
 aisa nahin he ki team india ke paas tej gendbaajon ke opshan nahin hai aise main eshanth par chayankarta kab tak daanv lagaana chaahate hai?tii-20, vanade international or test teenon hi format main eshantpichley kuch samay main fail hi hue hai
 It has been a time to see them in form
 aise main wo team ke liye ek boj kii tarah hi ban gaye hai
 Even in the World Cup, Ishant was selected in the team but was ruled out due to injury
 indian premier lig main sunrisers hyderabad kii ore se eshanth ne chaar maichon main mahaj ek wicket liya
 While he was far ahead in scoring runs
 lambey samay se unhen acchhee line or length se gendbaaji karte hue nahin dekha gaya he
 If you talk about the IPL, seeing Ashish Nehra's performance, he could have been included in place of Ishant
 bangladesh ke khilaaf team india 2 pesar or teen spinner ke saath utar sakati thi lekin captain or team management ne teen pesar or 2 spinner kaa formula hi apanaaya or eshanth ko ekbar phir plaing ilevan main shaamil kar liya
 In 'bedam' ODI, Ishant has bowled in 5 odis since January 2014
 2 match newjiland main khele gaye jabaki baaki 3 match bhartiya sarajameen par hue
 In these five matches, Ishant took 6 wickets, out of which he took 4 wickets in the Cuttack ODI against Sri Lanka
 newjiland main nepier or hamiltan vanade main unhone ek-ek wicket liya
 It is not that Ishant makes opportunities for other bowlers to take wickets by curbing runs
 is dauraan unka iconmi rate bhi zyada hi rahaa he
 In such a situation, it can prove dangerous for the team to include them in the playing eleven of the ODI team
 tii-20 main bhi hue 'fail'cricket ke sabase chote format main bhi eshanth kuch khaas nahin kar sake hai
 In the IPL, he took just one wicket after taking 159 runs in four matches
 kings ilevan punjab ke khilaaf khele gaye apane aakhri match main to eshanth sharma ne 49 ran akele hi lutaa daale the
 Talking about the International T20 match, he played the last T20 match for India in October 2013
 international tii-20 maichon main eshanth ne 14 match main 8 wicket hi liye hai
 During this, he 8
 63 ke iconmi rate se ran lutaae hai
 Now the matter of Test cricket, Keeshant has played the last five Test matches on foreign soil, which helps the fast bowlers
 july 2014 main lords test main england ke khilaaf unhone ek match main 7 wicket liye jabaki australia ke khilaaf disambar 2014 main hue brisben test main unhone 6 wicket jatke
 Apart from this, he had 4 wickets in a match, 2 in one and one wicket in one
 eshanth ko team main bane rahane ke liye apane tarkash main kuch nae tir laane honge
 His bowling is no longer visible
 philhal to chayankarta eshanth par meharbaan najar aate hai lekin agar unhone apni gendbaaji nahin sudhari to wo samay dur nahin jab unhen team se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya jayega

 While hearing the case on Tuesday, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi rejected Nageswara Rao's apology
 chif justise ne nageshwar raav par ek lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya, iske alaava jab tak court kii kaarywahi (aaj) chalegi tab tak nageshwar raav or duusare adhikari ko corner main baithna hoga

 Now let them go

 After the strict comments of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Attorney General KK Venugopal said that if you sentence Nageswara Rao to any punishment, his career could be spoiled

 Commenting on this, CJI said that how can you think that legal advice was received after approval

 This decision will directly affect the career of Nageswara Rao
 agar ham unki maafee ko kabool bhi karte hai or unhen sajaa nahin dete hai, phir bhi unhen ye maananaa hi hoga

 In his defense, the Attorney General argued that the central agency's office constantly interrupts the work
 data apalo karne ke liye bhi hamane isse pehle bhi 20 embi internet kii maang kii thi
 What is the matter? Let me tell you that in the Muzaffarpur case, the court order was that the transfer of CBI officer AK Sharma, who is investigating, should not be done without the permission of the court

 bhartiya raksha anusandhan evam vikaas sanghathan (DRDO) ne bhavishya main hone vaale yudhon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nae takanic vaale hypersonic hathiyaar or misile banane ke liye research karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Let me tell you, the speed of the hypersonic weapon and missile DRDO is talking about is five times higher than the sound and it can cover a distance of more than a mile in a second
 is bare main DRDO ke varisht adhikari ne kaha ki hypersonic missile ke pareekshan ke liye ek pawan surang kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he
 It is expected that Defense Minister Rajnath Singh will inaugurate it soon
 haalanki isse pehle bani antaramahadwipiya misile bhi superfast gati se hamalaa karti hai, lekin hypersonic misile apni gati ko lekar laajawab hai
 As reported by Hindustan Times, another senior officer of DRDO while talking about the characteristics of hypersonic weapons and missiles said that these missiles easily demolish targets by dodging missile defense systems
 iske saath hi isamen lambii duuri tak parmaanu or paramparaagat mukhaastra bheje ja sakenge
 Also it will not be possible to shoot down and chase these missiles
 shaayad yahi kaaran he ki vishwa ke sainya rup se taqatvar deshon main shaamil rus, china or america main agali peedi ke is hathiyaar ko jald se jald hasil karne kii hode-si lagi hui he
 However, retired Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia said that China had recently claimed to have a hypersonic missile
 mana ja rahaa he ki america ke paas bhi is tarah kii misile pehle se hai
 Russia may also have it
 teenon hi desh tarah-tarah kii hypersonic mixilon kaa pareekshan karne main jute hai taaki khud ko sainya lihaaj se majboot bana saken
 The report quoted General Vinod Bhatia as saying that India should also start work on developing such a missile as soon as possible

 Along with this, DRDO has also been thinking of providing its technology to the Indian industry for free
 bataa den, desh main raksha utpaadon ko badhaava dene ke makasad se DRDO apni 1500 patent takanic bhartiya udyogon ko muft main muhaiyaa karaane kii yojana par kaam kar rahaa he
 These include technologies related to missiles and many other fields including medical science
 is bare main DRDO chairman ji satish reddy ne kaha- start-ap, madhya or majhole udyogon ko patent karai gai takanic ko muft main muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 Reddy said that DRDO is committed to encourage industries to build better defense equipment with a view to promoting Make in India
 reddy ke mutabik desh main abhi 1800 raksha udyog hai, jinhen badhaayaa jayega taaki haathiyaaron kii takneekee kshamta ko badhaayaa ja sake
 In addition, DRDO said that it would not charge any license fees or royalties for it
 unhone kaha ki transfar of technology (TOT) ke tahat udyogon kii madad kii ja rahi he
 Under this, the TOT fee has been reduced to five percent from the earlier 20 percent
 iske alaava bhartiya sena ko hathiyaar aapurti par ab koi roylty nahin lee jaati
 However, a nominal two per cent royalty will be charged for exporting weapons

 Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan has once again questioned the economic decisions of the Modi government
 india today ko die gaye intervyuu main raghuram rajan ne is baat par jor diya ki sirf 'mek in india' nahin 'mek for india' bhi ho
 He also said that he also intends to become RBI Governor again
 notebandi kaa jidipi par padaa prabhavarajan ne intervyuu main kaha ki notebandi kii vajah se jidipi main 1-2 pratishat kii giravat dekhi gai
 RBI had to bear the burden of demonetisation
 nae note print karne kaa bhaar is yojanaon ke phaayde par baari padaa
 He said that if we trust the estimates of organizations like JP Morgan, demonetisation has caused a loss of 1-2 per cent of GDP, which is around 2 lakh crore
 vahiin phaayde kii baat karen to tex se sirf lagbhag 10 hajaar karod kii aamadani hui
 At the same time, he said that RBI has the right to print notes because India can become Zimbabwe if the government starts printing its own money
 yahi vajah he ki arabiai jaisi ek swatantra sanstha kii jarurat padati he
 No date was found for demonetization
 Rajan also said that the government did not need RBI permission for demonetisation
 saath hi notebandi ke liye koi taarikh nahin mili thi
 He said that the government had already been warned about the economic challenges of demonetisation and his forecast came true
 vaapasi ko taiyarrajan ne kaha ki unhone istipha nahin diya, unka turm khatm hua tha
 Rajan told that he was ready to work further
 saath hi bataaya ki bahut kaam baaki hai
 Much remains to be done to improve the bank system
 rajan ne apni manshaa jaahir karte hue kaha ki vah dobaaraa vaapasi karnaa chahenge
 The pressure of the bank board remains that in giving loans to big borrowers like Mallya, the land of the banks is owned by the board of banks
 jab lone apruval ke liye file aati he to public sector bank ke board main shaamil udyogpatiyon kii vajah se rasukhwalon ko aasaani se bade lone mil jate hai
 However, Rajan said that the system has improved in the last few years and it will improve further after the new bill on bankruptcy is implemented
 vahiin unhone majboot kanoon banane kii baat bhi kii, unke anusaar abhi puraane kanoon hai, jo chote karjadaaron par dabaav daalate hai, lekin bade karjadaar apane vakeelon kii fouj kii vajah se batch nikalate hai
 However, it is not the case that due to the stringent law, there will be an atmosphere of fear on every side and economic conditions become worse
 privet nivesh nahin ho raharajan ne kaha ki bharat kii economi zyaadaatar privet nivesh par nirbhar rahati he
 At the same time, private investors are not investing anything in public domain
 iskaa prabhaav desh kii economi par pad rahaa he
 Concerned over the reduced employment Rajan said that he was worried about the loss of employment opportunities after the ban
 agar ham rojgaar nahin paidaa karenge to halaat or kharaab honge
 It is necessary to do these three things, Rajan told what steps he would have taken for economic reforms if he were the Finance Minister
 unhone bataaya ki unka sabase zyada jor infrastracchar ke vikaas par hota
 Infrastructure is the key to a better economy
 saath hi rajan ne kaha ki bharat main behatar power management kii jarurat he
 Not only are we doing low power generation, but there is also a need for improvement in distribution
 rajan ke anusaar sarkaar ko aayaat badhaane par bhi jor dena chahie
 Not just make in India but also make for India
 sarkaar ko export pramotion par dhyaan dena chahie
 In April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned that he had been avoiding for the last 11 months after assuming office
 unhone do baar mukesh ambani ke naam kaa ullekh kiya
 For the first time, to distance himself from the country's biggest and most influential industrialist and secondly, to fill the perceived gap between his government and the common man
 8 april ko die apane intervyuu main unhone kaha ki mukesh ambani or aam aadmi, donon ke liye hi lalaphitaashahee bilkul nahin chalegi
 On April 19, while addressing party mps, he defended the Land Acquisition Ordinance, stating, "who will live there (on land taken from farmers)"
 kya mukesh ambani vahaan rahenge?"pichley saal 26 may ko bharat ke 15wein pradhanmantri ke rup main shapath lene ke baad yah pehali baar tha jab modi dusron kii ore se taiyaar kiye khel kaa hissaa ban rahe the
 Thus, it was the last evidence that the opposition, which had come together in a relentless onslaught to describe the bjp-led central government as corporate-friendly and anti-poor, had returned to the game
 pichley saal garmiyon main hue aam chunaav main mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress or jayalalita kii eiediemke ko chhodkar sabhi mukhya vipakshi partiyaan karaari haar kaa munh dekhne ke baad kareeb chah maheene tak khamosh thim
 The opposition's withdrawal of opposition parties began in December last year when the government brought in the Land Acquisition Ordinance
 iske baad sarkaar ko tab ek or jhatka laga jab is saal dilli main farvari main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main aam aadmi party ne bijepi ko chaaron khaane chit kar diya
 Then in the month of March, the wheel of time began to spin when 14 parties led by Congress President Sonia Gandhi marched to Rashtrapati Bhavan and submitted a memorandum against the land ordinance
 or 19 april ko sarkaar ko vipaksh kii ore se ab tak ke sabase talkh tevar kaa saamana karnaa padaa jab 56 din kii chuttee se lautne ke baad aakraamak mudra main aa chuke rahul ne dilli main adhyadesh ke khilaaf samarthan hasil karne ke liye kisaanon kii vishaal raily ko sambodhit kiya
 Former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh says, "the Land Acquisition Bill acted as a catalyst in bringing opposition parties together
 "galatiyon par lagaambijapi ab apni galatiyon ko sudhaarney kii koshish main lag gai he
 Knowing that the opposition's unity is revolving around the Land Acquisition Bill, Modi has made every effort to build good relations with Mamata Banerjee and Jayalalithaa
 9 may ko unhone mamata kii maujuudagi main kolkata se saamaajik suraksha kii teen yojanaayen shuru kin, or aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main bari hone ke do din baad hi jayalalita se phone par baat kii
 The problem for Modi is that this affectation will continue
 kabhi endie to kabhi upie kaa daaman pakadaaey kaa itihaas rakhane vaali mamata or jayalalita ko halke main nahin liya ja saktaa
 And in such a situation, when West Bengal elections are going to be held next year
 vahaan musalamaanon kii aabaadi kul votaron kii 20 fisadi he or usamen tiemasi kaa majboot janaadhar he
 Modi may also get a jolt from Bihar, where the Janata Parivar parties — the Janata Dal (united), Lalu Prasad's Rashtriya Janata Dal and Mulayam Singh Yadav's Samajwadi Party — are reuniting
 agar janata parivaar ekajute hone main kaamyaab rahaa or is saal ke aakhir main bihar vidhansabha ke chunaavon main usne kadi tactor di, agar haal ke nagarpalika chunaavon kii tarah vidhansabha main bhi tiemasi ne bijepi kaa safaya kar diya, or agar guwahati kii taraf bijepi ke kadam rokane ke liye congress ne assam main badaruddin ajmal kii ol india united democratic front se gathbandhan kiya to modi or unke sipahasalaron ko kadi takkar jhelni pad sakati he
 In such a situation, the challenge will be to take the opposition along, not to confront it
 desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 Pakistan's firing on the border again from India appealed not to take any action
 On Tuesday, the PAK itself started firing
 After the Indian Army's action against terrorists in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok), the PAK Army on Tuesday received some foreign officials from that area
 Took into where the Indian Army took action
 khaas baat ye he ki is maukey ke liye PAK army kii taraf se bhartiya fouj se apil kii gai thi ki vah is daure ke bich apni karrwai roke rahe taaki videshi adhikariyon ko koi nuksaan naa pahunche
 There was a complete ceasefire from the Indian side during this period, but Pakistan changed the maneuver and continued firing on the border in the meantime
 pakistani sena kii taraf se ye apil somvaar ko kii gai thi
 The Pakistan Army said that they want to take foreign journalists and officials to some areas adjacent to the Line of Control, so no action should be taken on the border on this day
 pakistan jis vakt pok ke is kshetra main videshi patrakaron ko le gaya to mujaffarabad main sthaneey nivasee pakistani sena ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe the
 India agreed to the appeal of foreign media Pakistan in Pakistan
 lekin pakistan apane hi vaade par mukar gaya or mangalvaar ko khud hi golibari shuru kar di
 Pakistan on Tuesday also opened fire in Poonch, Mendhar, bordering areas and violated the ceasefire
 pakistan kii is golibari kii vajah se border ilaake ke paas schuli bacchon ko kaaphi mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, saath hi ek mahila bhi ghayal ho gai he
 Read this: The stir in Pakistan due to the action of the Indian Army, now taking the foreigners to the areas adjacent to the Safdiborder that is giving the world PAK Significantly, the appeal that Pakistan made to India was accepted, but it lived up to its own point
 Could not land bataa den ki pichley ek hafte se pakistan seemaa par baari golibari kar rahaa he, isi par javaabi karrwai karte hue bharat ne tangadhaar sector ke saamne pok main aatanki addon ko nishaanaa banaaya tha
 Many terrorists and Pakistani army soldiers were killed in this action of India
 haalanki, pakistan kii ore se lagaataar in daavon ko galat bataane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 In this series, Pakistan took many foreign journalists and officials to the Neelum Valley on Tuesday and visited the border areas
 pakistani sena ke pravaktaa asif gafoor beete do dinon se twit ke jariye lagaataar bharat ke khilaaf bayaan de rahe the or kah rahe the ki vah bhartiya kamishan ko neelam vaili main aane kaa nyotaa dete hai, taaki vah check kar saken ki us kshetra main koi bhi aatanki adda nahin he
 However, even before that Pakistan did this during surgical strike, airstrike and spread propaganda by taking foreign media to their areas
 vishwa kii bhishantam audyogic traasadee bhopal gas cond kaa faisla aane ke do din baad madhyapradesh sarkaar ne ucch nyaayalay main is faisle ko chunauti dene kaa nirnay kiya he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, while speaking to reporters here today, termed the decision as disappointing and said that in order to provide justice to the gas victims, the government has decided to challenge it in the High Court and all its laws to study aspects
 a five-member committee has been formed
 unhone bataaya ki is samiti main mahadhivaktaa aar
 D
 jain, purv mahadhivaktaa vivek tankhaa evam anand mohan maathur, pramukh sachiv vidhi e
 K
 mishra tathaa shantilal lodha hai
 The Principal Secretary will be the convener of the Law Committee
 unhone bataaya ki samiti se apni praarambhik anushansa 10 din main or antim prativedan ek maah ke bheetar dene ko kaha gaya he taaki nirdhaarit 90 din ke bheetar faisle ko chunauti di ja sake
 Expressing doubt over the intentions of the Central Government and the CBI in this case, Chauhan said why the Central Government and the CBI had not filed a reconsideration petition when the Supreme Court had converted the sections of culpable homicide to negligence
 unhone kaha ki isi prakaar union carbide ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh warren anderson ke pratyrpan ke prayaas bhi kagaji rahe tathaa koi gambhir prayaas nahin kiye gayi
 Referring to the discussion with the jurists, the Chief Minister said that he has been told that (section 71) a separate offense under Section 304A is made for every death and for each such offense, the convicts according to two years Convictions can be given a much longer sentence which can be more than life imprisonment
 unhone kaha ki maamla sibiai kaa he isaliye sajaa badhaane ke liye apil sibiai ko hi karnaa chaiye lekin ab dhara 372 dand prakriya samhita ke praavdhaan main sanshodhan ho jane ke baad sajaa badwane ke liye apil peedit paksh bhi kar saktaa he or chunki is maamle main peedit paksh janata he or rajya sarkaar janata kaa pratinidhitiv karti he isaliye vah doshiyon ko sajaa badwane se peeche nahin hategi
 In response to a question, Chauhan said that since the CBI was looking into the matter, the state government had not interfered in the matter, but now after a disappointing decision, the government decided to challenge the decision
 gas cond ke dauraan bharat aaye anderson ko tatkaaleen sarkaar dwaara chod diye jane ko durbhagyapurna qaraar dete hue mukhyamantri ne kaha ki iskaa uttar kendra sarkaar ko hi dena hoga ki anderson ko us samay kyon jane diya gaya
 He said that we regret that we could not punish the biggest convict in the gas scandal

 State Bank of India is alleged to have acquired shares at a higher price
 meena ne kaha, "emdiare ke sandarbh main karj kaa ek hissaa alag kar liya gaya or siarpies ke rup main jari kiya gaya, jise baad main 31 march 2011 ko 64

 kashmir main jume kii naamaj ke baadapatharbajeeki tasviren aksar saamne aati hai, magar is baar patharbaji kii jo tasviren saamne ai hai, unamem ek nayaa plan chipa hua he
 This new plan is Jammu and Kashmir Police
 darasal, jammu-kashmir police ne patharbaji ko anjaam dene vaale asli gunaahagaaron ko giraftaar karne ke liye khudapattharbazkabheshabana liya or bheed main shaamil ho gaye
 On Friday, after offering prayers in Kashmir, the stone-pelts started shouting as usual, when the policemen involved disguised in the crowd started catching them
 is dauraan kai patharbaajon ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya
 Policemen in the crowd of people who threw stones brought them
 vahiin, duusari tarah surakshabal patharbaajon ko kaabo main karne kii koshish bhi karte rahe
 The new plan of Jammu and Kashmir Police could not even understand the stone-pelting
 pakistan ke paaltu algaavaadiyon ke gumraah kiye hue patharbaajon ko jab bheed main bhesh badalakar shaamil pulicekarmi pakadaney lage, to unako kuch samaj main hi nahin aayaa
 These stone-pelters mistook policemen as their friends
 jo tasviren saamne ai hai, unamem nakaab baandhe pulicekarmi patharbaajon ke bich se ek yuvak ko pakadakar laata dikh rahaa he
 It is being told that in order to control the masked stone-bearers, Jammu and Kashmir jawans themselves, wearing disguises like stone-pelts, joined their group
 patharbaajon ne inhen apana saathi samajha or isi baat kaa phayda uthaakar surakshabalon ne patharbaji kara rahe sargana ko pakad liya
 Earlier in 2010, the security forces adopted a similar plan and this formula is being adopted once again to join the group of marchers
 ab yahaan sawaal yah he ki patharbaajon ke khilaaf kya surakshabalon kaa ye master stroke he yaa iske apane nuksaan bhi ho sakate hai
 Certainly, this formula to rein in stonewallers is fine, but there is also a danger of the security forces being identified
 haalanki kuch raksha visheshgy is stratji ko behtareen maan rahe hai
 Two days ago, Jammu and Kashmir DG Sheeshpal Vaidya has been transferred
 unki jagah diji jail rahe dilbagh singh ko jammu-kashmir kii kaman saunpi gai he
 In such a situation, it is believed that the new DG has made a new plan to deal with the stones
 haalanki aapako bataa den ki jammu-kashmir police kii taraf se aisi yojana kii pushti nahin kii gai he, magar mana yahi ja rahaa he ki patharbaajon kii palaton main ghuskar unhen pakadaney kii yojana patharbaji kii ghatnaon par lagaam lagane ke liye kiya gaya nayaa prayog he
 Now how successful this experiment will be, it will be known in the coming times
 rajdhani dilli kii ek vyast sadak par us samay afra-tafari much gai jab uskaa ek bada hissaa kai feet neechein dhans gaya
 a car and auto fell into a deep pit in the incident
 bataa den ki yah puri ghatana mijpur-badarpur metro stesan ke paas hui
 The car and the auto driver suffered minor injuries in the incident
 ghatana kii soochna milte hi ghayalon ko baahar nikaala gaya
 He is currently undergoing treatment
 sadak kaa hissaa dhansane seppehale auto or phir car usamen gir gai
 As the incident unfolded, crowds of people came for help
 sadak ke bichon bich hue is gaddhon ko bharne ke liye peedbludy vibhaag ne kaam shuru kar diya he
 But the way a large section of the busy road is being sunk in this way raises many questions
 gauratlab he ki kuch varsh pehle dilli ke bhairon maarg par sadak dhansane se bane bade gadde kii vajah se rajdhani ke ek bade hisse kii raftaar tham gai thi
 Due to the pit, a road between Ring Road to Mathura Road had to be closed
 sadak band hone se ring road, itio, enech-24 ashram, sarai kaale khan ke aasapaas kai kilometre lanbaa trephic jam lag gaya tha
 According to locals, the Jal Board has a large pipeline on Bhairon Marg
 pipe line main pani li hone se sadak dhans gayi thi
 It underwent temporary repairs but re-sunk a day later
 laaparvaahee kii had ye thi ki dilli sarkaar isaki marammat kaa kaam 24 ghante baad bhi shuru nahin kar paayi thi
 However the government was claiming that the work was going on on a war footing

 Shah, the party general secretary, has created a new OBC leadership in the BJP dominated by the upper castes and thus weakened the Samajwadi Party's strong hold over the obcs
 uttar pradesh main shah ne anya pichhadi jatiyon ko 50 pratishat tikat die the
 Analysts studying the impact that this decision has had on the state call it Shah's "new formula for stake in power", in which there is no compromise with ideology
 in vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki tikat paane vaale zyaadaatar obisi ummidavaar bijepi-aresas prishthbhumi se hai, na ki duusari partiyon se laae gaye hai
 Says political analyst Vidyut Thakar, "shah has renewed vigor in the brahmin-bania leadership of the party which has been frustrated and inactive for the last 15 years and through this he got tickets for his OBC candidates of RSS-BJP
" ’’iskaa ek acha udhaaharan sanbhal kii loksabhaa seat he, jis par kabhi bhi bijepi ko jeet nahin mili thi
 On the basis of caste arithmetic, Shah gave a ticket to Satyapal Singh Saini, a candidate from backward Mali caste
 shah ne saini ko jab yah bataaya ki unhen party kaa tikat diya ja rahaa he to saini ro pade, kyonki unhone kabhi ummid nahin kii thi ki oonchi jatiyon ke dabadabe vaali party bijepi main unhen tikat mil paaegaa

 Modi's ally Shah may not be a minister in the new government, but he has a lot of organization work

 In August, Sholay, one of the biggest Bollywood successful films, is completing 40 years of its success
 har senepremi kii tarah superstar salmaan khan ke dil main bhi yah film basii hui he
 For him, this film is special not only because of its goodness, but also because 'sholay' was written by his father Salim Khan along with Javed Akhtar
 jab 'sholay' ke 40 saal puraa hone par salmaan se kuch puraani yaadon ke bare main poocha gaya, to unhone bataaya ki kis tarah vah bachapan main apane chote bhai arbaz ke saath film kii screening par gaye the
 The comments 'sholay' kii tarif karte hue salmaan ne kaha, 'waisi film dobaaraa nahin ban sakati
 Even if someone has tried to make that film, then his fate is bad
 " Salman said, "sholay is a memorable film
 behtareen tareeke se likhi gai film he
 Every one of his dialogues is still famous and spoken
 uske chote-chote likhe gaye dialogs ko jis tarah kalakaaron ne adaa kiya vah bemisaal rahaa

 Is a film written in a great way
 uske ek-ek samvaad aaj bhi mashhoor hai or bole jate hai
 The way the actors played his short written dialogues was unmatched
 " Cities in India need to be seen closely
 sadakon par kaaren bhari hai or aadmi un kaaron main ghanton fansaa hua he
 The air condition is poor
 thodi si barsaat hoti he ki shahar doobane lagate hai
 There is no major city in India that is not moaning from traffic jams and polluted air
 hamen lagata he ki yah koi vakti samasya he, magar ab yah maan lenaa chahie ki hamaare shahar dam todane ke kagaar par hai
 The talk of making them better is in the newspapers only, rarely seen on the ground
 avasar bhi inhen shaharon main hai to jaahir he aabaadi kaa dabaav bhi badhegaa
 The facilities of the city were privatized for twenty years
 shaayad or nijeekaran kii koi tarkeeb nikaali ja rahi he
 But the weakness in the administration of corporations in this process has compounded the problem even more
 bengalooru ke Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy ne 21 shaharon kaa survey karne ke baat ye nateeja nikaala he
 Every city is rated on different scales, so no city has done much better
 matlab aap kisi ko bhi model shahar ke rup main pesh nahin kar sakate hai
 Thiruvananthapuram, Pune and Kolkata are among the top cities in the country
 2015 main dilli chathe sthaan par thi, 2016 main nauven sthaan par aa gai he
 Delhi's performance has been poor on three points of urban governance
 ek karod 80 lakh aabaadi he dilli kii
 The country's capital is also behind Bhopal and Kanpur
 yah sunakar kanpur waalon ko khush hone kii jarurat nahin he
 During the Brihanmumbai Municipal elections, we had said that the revenue collection laws near Kanpur are much better than Mumbai but the city does not collect property tax in proportion to the number of houses
 dilli ko nagar yojana ke maamle main sabase adhik ank mili hai
 More than Mumbai and Bengaluru
 main bahut zyada reating ko lekar utsahit nahin hota hum
 Each rating agency has different scales and different ratings
 phir bhi iske bahaane agar shaharon ke prashasan, unki paardarshita, javabdehi or bhagidaari ko lekar charchaa karne kaa mauka mili to ise haath se nahin jane dena chahie
 It has been found in the survey that 21 cities are able to recover only 37 per cent of the money they spend
 patna to khud se 17 fisadi hi vasuul paata he
 The city is also in dire need of operations
 mumbai, hyderabad or pune, ye teen shahar hai jo apane kharche kaa 50 fisadi khud jutate hai
 The survey says that no city in India can compete with London and New York
 yah kehete hue ham nahin jaanate hai ki landan or neuyark kii apni kya samasyaayein hai
 Ten numbers were placed for the scale created for this survey
 bharat ke kisi bhi shahar ne chaar ank se adhik hasil nahin kiye hai
 While London and New York 9
 4 or 9
 Got 7 points
 kisi bhi bhartiya shahar ke paas master plan ke ulanghan ko rokane kii thos niti nahin he
 Unauthorized colonies are flourishing in every city
 is maamle main bharat ke sabhi shahar ko shunya ank mili hai
 It has its own politics to introduce unauthorized colonies and slums
 dilli main hi saath se sattar fisadi log jhuggi jaisi jagah main rahete hai
 Their case cannot be seen only through the spectacles of legitimate and illegal
 baharhaal atikaraman bhi ek sachai he jiskaa phayda garib logon se zyada amir or prabhaavshaalee log uthaate hai
 As the public space of the entire city is occupied by people with their cars
 mohalle ke mohalle jaakar dekhie to chalane-phirane kii jagah par logon kii car khadi he
 We do not see this encroachment but see slum dwellers as the problem because they are poor and weak
 isliye kaha ki kisi jhuggi ko dekhne kaa najariya apane aap main raajnneetik najariya he
 In 2014, Bengaluru Municipal Corporation surveyed 400 buildings
 sirf teen ne niyamon kaa paalan kiya tha
 Therefore, resourceful people, who call themselves tax payers, break the rules when compared to the poor and weak
 wo zyaada atikaraman karte hai
 Their colony road is built with the money of the government but they make it their own by putting a gate
 ye tab he jab ek pratishat log bhi is desh main tex nahin dete hai
 We will talk whether all those who have built houses in a legal manner, pay house tax
 survey kuch sawaal uthta he jin par bahes honi chahie jaise- hamen dekhnaa hoga ki ham nigamon or nagarpalikaon main kitna nivesh kar rahe hai
 Most of the laws of the planning of cities remain from the last century
 bharat main chaar lakh kii aabaadi par ek planar he, niojak he
 There are 48 lakhs in the United States and 148 in the UK
 planar kii kya bhoomika he, yah bhi ham thik se nahin jaanate hai
 It is not that nothing is happening about cities
 ho rahaa he magar kuch kaam yahaan acha ho rahaa he to kuch vahaan
 The change has not yet begun at the system level
 yah baat koi aaj nahin uth rahi he, na hi janaaagrah pehali baar uthaa rahaa he, balki aap pichley mumbai, dilli, bengalooru, pune or kolkata jaise bade shaharon ke akhbaar uthaakar dekh len unamem nigamon kii samasya ko lekar khub charchaa hoti he
 There are news
 rajasthan or urisa kaa udhaaharan survey report main diya gaya he, ham us par baat karenge
 Orissa is the first state in India to have a separate municipal cadre for officers of corporations and municipalities
 is report ko aap website par jaakar jarur padhein kaaphi kuch samajhane ko milegaa
 For example, on a population of one lakh, there is a severe shortage of staff in large to small cities
 dilli main ek lakh par 1260 karmchaaree hai to ranchi main sirf 87
 There is no system to monitor how much water leaked, was used
 kaayade se sabhi ko pani kii supplai milani chahie, magar 71 pratishat aabaadi ko hi milti he
 Only 39 percent of the cost incurred on water supply is collected by the corporation
 jaahir he shaharon main pani aapurti kii haalat kharaab he
 We talk about supply but there is no effort to save water
 isi tarah se kisi bhi shahar main kachra prabandhan ke behatar intjaam nahin hai
 Garbage is raised half-way, there is a lot of corruption
 parshad kachra uthaane vaali agenciyon main hissedaar hote hai, jo nahin hona chahie
 Councilors have not got sufficient and clear rights in any city
 is paimaane par bharat ke har shahar ko das main se teen ank hi mili hai
 But what is special about Kerala's capital Thiruvananthapuram which is getting the first place twice
 is pehle sthaan main ek bhi jhol he
 10 to 4 to Thiruvananthapuram
 4 ank mili hai
 That is, without bringing first division, a city has come at number one
 matdaan ke maamle main tiruvanantpuram pehle number par he
 Municipal elections here account for 72 percent of the vote
 duusare number par kolkata he jahaan 69 fisadi matdaan hota he, tisare number par ludhiana he jahaan 63 fisadi log matdaan karte hai
 In Patna, 47 percent of the vote is held
 survey report main pej number 25 par dilachasp jaankaree he ki shahar daawa kya karte hai or unki asaliyat kya he
 This list has been made on the basis of the CAG report
 iske anusaar tiruvanantpuram urban planning ke maamle main jo daawa karata he vah asaliyat main nahin he
 Even in the case of building, its claim is far from real
 gharelu or audyogic maamle main pani kii supplai ko lekar jo daawa kiya gaya he wo hakeekat main nahin he
 In the case of public health, sanitation and waste management, what the city claims is not in reality
 fire sefti ke maamle main bhi sthiti kharaab he
 The claims made by Thiruvananthapuram in terms of reducing gadriabi and improving slums are close to reality
 sadak or pul ke maamle main bhi iskaa pradarshan acha he
 The CAG report exposes the number one city of India in this way
 magar aap reating par mat jaaie, is report ke zarie jo mul sawaal uthte hai wo yah hai ki kya hamaari nagarpalikaayen behatar tareeke se kaam kar paa rahi hai
 Why the condition of our cities remains hellish
 meyar ke adhikaar kyon nahin spasht hai
 Why revenue collection is low
 kyon atikaraman ke maamle main bharat ke tamaam shaharon kaa pradarshan ek sa he
 i know that your city haunts you a lot
 har din trephic jam main aapako ghanton khadaa karata he, samay par pani nahin aata, pados kaa skool kharaab he
 The survey raises some questions which should be debated like - we have to see how much we are investing in corporations and municipalities
 shaharon kii yojana ke zyaadaatar kanoon pichhali sadi ke bane hue hai
 India has a planner, planner on a population of four lakhs
 america main chaar lakh par 48 or britain main 148 planar hai
 We do not even know exactly what the role of the planner is
 aisa nahin he ki shaharon ko lekar kuch nahin ho rahaa he
 It is happening but some work is being done here and some there
 system ke str par abhi badlaav kii shuruyaat nahin hui he
 No one is getting this thing today, nor is the Janagraha picking up for the first time, but rather you pick up the newspapers of the big cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune and Kolkata in the past, there is a lot of discussion about the problem of corporations
 khabaren hoti hai
 The example of Rajasthan and Orissa is given in the survey report, we will talk about that
 urisa bharat kaa pehla rajya he jahaan nigamon or nagarpalikon ke adhikariyon ke liye alag se municipal cader bana he
 Read this report by visiting the website, you will get to understand a lot
 jaise - ek lakh kii aabaadi par staff kii bhi bade se lekar chote shaharon main bhayankar kami he
 Delhi has 1260 employees at one lakh, while Ranchi has just 87
 pani kitna li hua, istemaal hua, is par nazar rakhane kaa koi system nahin he
 Normally everyone should get water supply, but only 71 percent of the population gets it
 pani kii aapurti par jo laagat aati he uskaa 39 fisadi hi nigam vasuul pate hai
 Obviously, the condition of water supply in the cities is poor
 ham aapurti kii baat karte hai magar pani bachaane kaa kahin koi prayaas nahin he
 Similarly, there is no better waste management system in any city
 aadhe-adhure tareeke se kachra uthaaya jaataa he, khub bhrashtachar he
 Councilors are partners in garbage picking agencies, which should not be
 kisi bhi shahar main parshadon ko paryaapt or spasht adhikaar nahin mili hai
 On this scale, every city in India has got only three out of ten marks
 lekin kerala kii rajdhani tiruvanantpuram main aisa kya khaas he jise do baar se pehla sthaan mil rahaa he
 There is a single bag in this first place
 tiruvanantpuram ko 10 se 4
 Got 4 points
 yani bina first divizan laae koi shahar pehle number par aa gaya he
 Thiruvananthapuram is number one in terms of voting
 yahaan nagarpalika ke chunaav main 72 fisadi matdaan hota he
 Kolkata is at number two with 69 percent voting, Ludhiana at number three is 63 percent
 patna main 47 fisadi hi matdaan hota he
 There is interesting information on page number 25 in the survey report about what cities claim and what they are
 kaig kii report ke aadhaar par yah suchi banaai gai he
 According to this, what Thiruvananthapuram claims in terms of urban planning is not in reality
 building banane ke maamle main bhi iskaa daawa asaliyat se dur he
 The claims made regarding supply of water in domestic and industrial matters are not in reality
 public health, safai, kachra prabandhan ke maamle main bhi shahar jo daawa karata he, hakeekat main nahin he
 The situation is also bad in the case of fire safety
 gadaribi kam karne ke maamle or jhuggiyon ko behatar banane ke maamle main tiruvanantpuram ne jo daawa kiya he, wo hakeekat ke kareeb he
 It also performs well in terms of road and bridge
 kaig kii report bharat ke number van shahar kii is tarah se pole khol detii he
 But you do not go to the rating, the basic question that arises through this report is whether our municipalities are able to function better
 kyon hamaare shaharon kii sthiti naarkeey bani hui he
 Why the mayor's rights are not clear
 kyon rajasav vasuuli kam he
 Why the performance of all the cities of India is same in case of encroachment
 mujhe pataa he ki aapako aapkaa shahar bahut sataata he
 Every day makes you stand in traffic jam for hours, no water on time, neighborhood school is bad
 desh kii rajdhani dilli ek baar phir sharmasaar ho gai
 There is a sensational incident of rape with a National Kabaddi player
 itnaa hi nahin do naaballig bacchiyon ko bhi darindon ne havas kaa shikaar bana daalaa
 Thinking him dead, he threw them in the bushes and went away
 donon hi maamalon main police cese darj karke jaanch kar rahi he
 According to the information, a junior level national kabaddi player in Delhi alleges that she went to Chhatrasal Stadium on 9 July
 vahaan use ek shaks mila
 He described himself as the stadium's administrator and coach
 uski umr kareeb 30 saal thi
 He made the kabaddi player sit in his car on the pretext of turning around

 After this, the accused raped her

 police ne peedita ke bayaan or taharir ke aadhaar par aaropee ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 376 or poxo kanoon ke tahat cese darj kar liya he
 The victim is undergoing medical treatment

 The next day morning, the relatives have received bled girls

 Hours before the bodyguard was shot dead due to opposition to the blasphemy law, Punjab Governor Salman Tasir tweeted that he was not afraid of the opponents around him

 Sachin Tendulkar, considered the God of cricket, has announced his retirement from Test cricket
 unka kahana he ki yah bahut kathin samay he or cricket ke bina jindagi kii kalpana karnaa bhi mushkil he
 After deciding to retire, Sachin Tendulkar said, 'I dreamed of playing for the country in my life
 beete 24 saal se main har din is sapane ko ji rahaa hum
 It seems impossible for me to live without cricket because at the age of 11, i have been involved with this game
 desh ke liye khelnaa mere liye mahaan sammaan kii baat he
 i want to say goodbye to this great game while playing the 200th Test match at my home ground
 ''beete saalon main meraa saath dene ke liye main bisisiai ko dhanyavad kahana chahta hum, jab maine ritairement kii ichha jataai to mujhe ijaajat mil gai
 Also, i want to thank my family for their restraint and understanding of my spirit

 ' uttar pradesh main sharabbandi kii atakalon ko rajya ke aabkaari mantri ne khaarij kar diya he
 Excise Minister Jai Pratap Singh said that at present there is no plan for complete liquor ban in the state, but the state government is looking for ways to increase revenue
 aapako bataa den ki pichley kai dinon main upi main kai sharaab kii dukaanon par taala laga he jiske baad sharabbandi kii atakalein tej hui thi
 Jai Pratap Singh said that the state government will bring a new policy on alcohol after one year, because the previous government has already collected 2 years of revenue
 unhone kaha ki bihar main nitish kumaar ne sharabbandi isaliye lagu kii thi, kyonki vah unke menifesto kaa hissaa tha
 But the Uttar Pradesh government has no such plan
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court ke haive parsharab kii dukaanon par pabandike baad lagbhag saadhe 8 hajaar dukaanon main se 5 hajaar se zyada dukaane yaa to band ho chuki hai, yaa phir virodh ke kaaran license sarender kar diya he
 Campaign intensified a few days ago, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently held a meeting with the State Excise Department, after which the DIG range along with SP, CO and police force conducted checking operations in liquor contracts and shops in many areas of Lucknow
 
 saath hi puure pradesh main sharaab par lekar sakhti lagaataar badi thi
 The Supreme Court order is also serious
 The Kisupreme Court has recently issued an order, according to which liquor shops have been banned within 500 meters of the highway
 jiske baad se hi rajya sarkaron or sharaab ke kaarobaariyon main hadakamp kaa maahaul he
 State governments and liquor traders are also finding various ways to avoid this order
 desh main saudi style islam (salaafi yaa wahabi sampradaay) kaa prabhaav badhaane or protsaahan dene ke liye jo fund aa rahaa he, uski jamini hakeekat kii padtaal jaruri he? grih mantralay ke keval videshi anudaan niyaman act (epasiare) ke jariye hi aadhikarik rup se is tarah ke fund ke raste kaa pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 NDTV has analyzed the data of FCRA for the last three years to know how many Salafi ngos have received donations from Islamic Charities
 iske tahat kareeb 134 karod rupee ke chande kaa byora mila jo epasiare ke tahat salanaa aane vaali raashi kaa behad chota hissaa he
 The general belief is that most such donations come from Saudi Arabia, while this analysis shows that it is not
 sarvaadhik 51 karod rupee kaa chanda sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) se mila, uske baad britain se 36 karod rupee kaa chanda mila
 23 crore came from Kuwait and 10 crore from Canada
 is avadhi main saudi arab se chande ke rup main 4
 5 crores received
 vastav main ye aankade desh bhar main faile salaafi masjidon or madrason ke aankadon kii puri tasviir pesh nahin karte
 In Delhi, at the head office of the country's leading Salafi organization aihal-e-hadith, we were told that it has about one thousand madrassas all over the country
 yah aankada epasiare main soochibaddh salaafi enjio kii kul sankhya kii tulana main 10 guna adhik he
 However, members of this organization say that this has been expanded by local donations or self-funding
 lekin is sambandh main dilli ke institute of conphilict management and south asia terarysm portal ke akjicutive diarector ajay saahani kaa kahana he ki kuch vistaar avaidh dhan ke pravaah se bhi sambandhit ho saktaa he
 According to him, "large-scale illegal transactions appear
" hawala, galat tathyon ko pesh karne vaale haalia keson jaisaa ki jakir nik maamle main dekhne ko miltaa he
 He had many transactions through media companies
 '' However, the Salafis say that their appeal is based on the purist version of Islam and that their motive is to teach and there is nothing to be worried about their growth
 lekin upi or karnataka main jab NDTV ne kai salaafi madrason kaa daura kiya to hamane paaya ki kai vivaadit saudi salaafi viddhanon ko paathyakram main shaamil kiya gaya he
 For example, the 13th century preacher Ibn Taymiyyah is included, who is the author of the effective Mardin Fatwa
 aamtaur par puri duniya main jihadi samooh hinsa ko nyyochit tehraane ke liye iskaa sahaara lete hai
 In this case, Dr
 Syed Ashraf Jaishi, Head of Department, Arabica Studies, Maulana Azad National Urdu University, Hyderabad, says, "terrorist organizations spread all over the world are based on the principles and traditions of Ibn Taymiyyah
 ye ebn taiyamiyah kii kitabon ke uddharanon vishesh rup se mardin fatwa kaa hawala dete hai jisamen unhone kaha he ki koi lakshya apane lakshyon ko hasil karne yaa dushmano ko haraane yaa kisi ko nishaanaa banane ke liye use maar saktaa he
 '' iske saath hi salaafi madrason ke paathyakram main taiyamiyah ke uttaradhikari ebn abd al-wahaab bhi shaamil hai jinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki apni vibhaajak sankalpana 'al valah val baaraa' ke liye quran kii apane hisaab se vyakhya kii
 In this regard, Islamic Studies scholar Ghulam Rasul Dehalvi said, "it really means: Al Vallah means loyalty with Muslims and Vall Bara means enemy with non-muslims
" unhone quran kii kuch khaas aayaton kaa zikr kiya jisamen kaha gaya, 'yahudiyon or isaiyon ke saath dosti mat karo
 However, Wahab interpreted them out of context
 '' Another widely read book in Salafi madrasas is the Taqviyatul Iman (power of Religion) of the Indian Maulvi Ismail Dehalvi in which the Sufi tradition of India is held to be non-islamic
 jab in donon rajyon main NDTV ne salaafi masjidon ke pramukhon se baatcheet kii to unhone in kitabon kaa jabardast samarthan kiya or sufi parampara ke khilaaf bhavanaaen prakat kin
 The comments is maamle main dumriyaganj (upi) kii safa ajukational sosayadi ke sansthaapak abdul wahid madani kaa kahana he, ''yah sthiti he ki logon ke paas apane mata-pita kii kabr par jane kaa samay nahin he or isaki bajaay ve ajmer sharif jate hai
 This is completely wrong and should not be so
 yadi koi galat cheez 1,000 saal tak bhi kii jaati rahegi to vah galat hi rahegi
 '' haalanki salaafi shikshaaon ko charampanth se joda janaa bhale hi nyaaysangat na ho lekin sufi viddhan bharat main wahabi sampradaay ke badhate prabhaav se chintit hai
 In this case, Syed Babar Ashraf, founder of Lucknow's Sufi Vice of India, says, "just think, (sufi Saint) Nizamuddin Auliya, when he was handed the sword, he said what do i need?" i need a needle so that i can weave
 main vah shaks hum jo chizon ko faadta nahin hum balki silata hum
 '' NDTV ne pichley teen saal kaa epasiare ke data kaa vishleshan yah jaanane ke liye kiya he ki islamic charities se kitne salaafi enjio ko chanda mila he
 Under this, the details of donations of about Rs
 134 crores were found which is a very small part of the annual amount under FCRA
 aam dharna yah he ki sabase adhik is tarah kaa chanda saudi arab se aata he jabaki is vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki aisa nahin he
 The highest donation of Rs 51 crore came from United Arab Emirates (UAE), followed by Rs 36 crore from Britain
 kuwait se 23 karod rupee or canada se 10 karod rupee aae
 4 as donations from Saudi Arabia in this period
 5 karod rupee mili
 In fact, these figures do not present a complete picture of Salafi mosques and madrassas spread across the country
 dilli main desh ke pramukh salaafi sanghathan aihal-e-haddees ke head-offis main hamen bataaya gaya ki iske puure desh main kareeb ek hajaar madrase hai
 This figure is 10 times the total number of Salafi ngos listed in FCRA
 haalanki is sanghathan ke sadasyon kaa kahana he ki sthaneey donneshnon yaa self funding se yah vistaar hua he
 But in this regard, Ajay Sawhney, executive director of Delhi's Institute of Conflict Management and South Asia Terrorism Portal, says that some of the expansion may also be related to the flow of illegal money
 unke mutabik, ''bade paimaane par avaidh lenden dikhaai detaa he
 Hawala, recent cases presenting false facts as seen in the Zakir Naik case
 uski media companiyon ke madhyam se anek lenden hue
 '' haalanki salaafi log kehete hai ki unki apil islam kii shuddhtavaadi varjan par aadhaarit he or isi kii shiksha dena unka makasad he or unke badhaav se chintit hone kii koi baat nahin he
 But when NDTV visited several Salafi madrassas in UP and Karnataka, we found that many disputed Saudi Salafi scholars were included in the curriculum
 masalan 13veen sadi ke upadeshak ebn taiyamiyah ko shaamil kiya gaya he jo prabhavi mardin fatwa ke lekhak hai
 Generally, jihadi groups all over the world resort to this to justify violence
 is maamle main moulana aaazaad neshnal urdu uniwarsity, hyderabad ke arabic studies ke head of department dow saiyad ashraf jaishi kaa kahana he, ''puri duniya main faile hue aatanki sanghathan ebn taiyamiyah ke siddhanton or paramparaon par aadhaarit hai
 These quotes from Ibn Taymiyyah's books, specifically the Mardin fatwa, in which he states that a target can kill him to achieve his goals or defeat enemies or to target someone
 '' Also included in the course of the Salafi madrasas are Ibn Abd al-wahhab, the successor of Taymiyyah, who is said to have interpreted the Quran for his divisive concept 'al Vallah Vall Bara'
 islamic studies ke scollar gulam rasul dehalavi ne is sambandh main kaha, ''iskaa vastav main arth he: al valah yani muslimon ke saath vafadari or val baaraa yani gaiyr muslimon ke saath dushmani
 He referred to some specific verses of the Quran which said, 'do not have friendship with Jews and Christians
 ' haalanki wahaab ne inaki sandarbh se itar vyakhya kii
 '' salaafi madrason main ek anya padhai jane vaali kitaab bhartiya maulavee ismail dehalavi kii takviatul imaan (dharm kii takat) he jisamen bharat kii sufi parampara ko gaiyr-islamic tehraaya gaya he
 When NDTV interacted with the heads of Salafi mosques in these two states, they strongly supported these books and expressed sentiments against the Sufi tradition
 tippaniyan In this case, Abdul Waheed Madani, founder of Safa Educational Society of Dumariyaganj (UP), says, "it is a situation that people do not have time to visit the tomb of their parents and instead go to Ajmer Sharif
 ye puri tarah se galat he or aisa nahin hona chahie
 If anything wrong is done for 1,000 years, it will remain wrong
 '' Although the Salafi teachings may not be equated with extremism, Sufi scholars are concerned with the growing influence of the Wahhabi sect in India
 is maamle main lakhanu ke sufi vaais of india ke sansthaapak saiyad babar ashraf kaa kahana he, ''jaraa sochie (sufi sant) nizamuddin auliya ko jab talwaar saunpi gai to unhone kaha ki mujhe isaki kya jarurat he? mujhe sui chahie taaki main bunai kar sakuun
 i am the person who does not tear things but stitch them

 (ANI input ke saath) Ram Manohar Lohia does not have the status of a freedom fighter in the state, the name and thinking of the Samajwadi Party government in UP which is the basis of its policies and work
 ye khulaasa ek artiai ke jariye hua he, jisamen upi ke ab tak ke sabhi jivit or divangat swatantraaa sangram senaniyon ke naam maange gaye the
 Initially, the government departments were evasive in answering this
 lekin aakhir main jab maamla apil main soochna ayog pahunchaa to upi ke raajnneetik pension vibhaag se kul 316 swatantraaa senaniyon kii list di gai
 But the name Ram Manohar Lohiyaka, the father of the socialist movement and the most vocal voice against the British, was missing from this list
 captain abbaas ali bhi nahin swatantraaa senanisath hi is soochi main captain abbaas ali kaa naam bhi nadaarad tha, jinhen khaastaur par netaji subhash chandra bose ke saath kandhe se kandhaa mila kar angrejon se loha lenaa ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 Revealed in RTI Advocate and RTI activist Shailendra Singh Chauhan said, 'first there was a lot of procrastination from the government but after the matter was reported to the Information Commission, the list given to us by RTI through RTI was given by Lohiaji and Captain
 Abbas Ali did not have names
 'espi ke liye sharmindagi kaa sababajaahir he ki lohia ke usulon par chalane kaa dam bharne vaali samaajawaadee party ke liye ye khulaasa behad sharminda karne vaala tha kyonki samaajawaadee party jab-jab sarkaar main rahi he apni soch ko paribhaashit karne ke liye usne lohia ke naam kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya he
 Not only this, the most ambitious schemes of the government have also been named after Ram Manohar Lohia
 phir chaahe wo garibon ke liye awaas kii yojana ho yaa phir aspataal, sadak, skool, college, vishvavidhyalay or park

 Senior BSP leader Swami Prasad Maurya said, 'actually Mr
 Mulayam Singh Yadav has his own ambition behind this
 wo khud ko lohia se upar rakhana chaahate hai
 He wants to make his name the biggest socialism
 yahi vajah he ki lohia kii upeksha kii ja rahi he
 Their struggle is being denied
 'bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant bajpeyi ne kaha, 'lohia kaa naam suchi main nahin he
 Certainly action should be taken against the responsible person and instead of giving such an answer on RTI, the Samajwadi Party government should have first admitted its mistake and then added Lohia's name to the list of freedom fighters
 aisa nahin hua iskaa matlab he ki espi kaa lohia prem jhootha he or maatr dikhaava he
 The SP blamed the opposition The most shocking thing is that the name of Lohia, missing from the list of freedom fighters in UP, is called a conspiracy by the Samajwadi Party leader Congress
 paanch baar upi main sarkaar bana chuki samaajawaadee party ye baat ko maanane ko taiyaar nahin he ki uske prerak or vichaardhaara ke strot ram manohar lohia kaa naam aazaadee kii ladaai ladane waalon kii list se gaayab hone ke peeche kahin na kahin uski andekhi he
 MLC Yashwant Singh of Samajwadi Party said, 'congress party government was formed in India
 or congress ne ye dikhaane kaa prayaas kiya ki uske netaaon ne hi desh kii ladaai kii aazaadee ladi
 The Congress tried its best to ignore the other warriors, so it is difficult to find their names in the list of freedom fighters
 'sarkari vibhaagon kii safidusri taraf raajnneetik pension vibhaag bhi is maamle par safai pesh kii he
 Departmental sources say that the list of freedom fighters only includes the names of great men who accepted pension
 chunki sada jivan jeene vaale ambedkarnagar jile ke ram manohar lohia or aligarh ke captain abbaas ali samaajawaadee vichaardhaara ke hone ke saath-saath jivan bhar avivaahit rahe, isliye unhone sarkari khajaane se pension lene se inkaar kar diya
 Therefore, his name could not be included in the list of freedom fighters taking pension

 After weaving a network of roads under the Golden Quadrilateral project between the four major metros, the government has now approved a very ambitious project to connect the country's borders and ports with the national highway
 desh kii aarthik raftaar ko or tej karne ke liye neshnal haive se desh kii simaaon or costal aria ko joda jayega
 The government has named the project 'bharatmala'
 is pariyojna kaa kaam saat phej main puraa kiya jayega
 a total of 34,800 km of roads will be constructed across the country
 is yojana ko paravaan chadhaane main kul 5,35,000 karod rupye kharch honge
 This ambitious plan was approved in a cabinet meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday

 In this project, not only new roads will be built, but the projects which are incomplete will also be completed
 ‘bharatmala’ yojana main pichde ilaakon, dharmik sthanon ke saath-saath paryaton sthalon tak bhi sadakon kaa jaal bichaaya jayega
 The connectivity of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri will also be further improved to facilitate the Char Dham Yatra
 83 hajaar kilometre lambii sadakon kaa jaal bichhega‘bharatmala’ project main adhuri padi sadakon kaa kaam bhi kiya jayega
 In this way, a total network of 83 thousand kilometers of roads will be laid across the country
 is yojana par kharch hone vaali anumaanit raashi 7 lakh karod he
 Roads will be built in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan
 kul 17 rajyon kii tateey or seemaa kshetra main neshnal haive banaae jaaenge
 In the first phase of this scheme, an investment of three and a half lakh crore rupees will be done
 is project ko agle paanch saal main yani 2022 tak puraa kiya janaa he
 a total of 44 economic corridors will be built in it
 40 kilometre sadak rojaanaa bananaa he chunauti83 hajaar kilometre lambii sadaken banane ke liye sarkaar ko rojaanaa 46 kilometre sadaken banani hongi
 Right now only 30 km of road is under construction
 haalanki sadak evam parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne daawa kiya he ki sadak banane kii raftaar is saal hi 40 kilometre pratidin kar di jaaegi
 Distance will increase, but the time left in this plan will be reduced to reach the major cities of the country
 jaise ludhiana se ajmer kii maujuuda neshnal haive se duuri 627 kilometre he, jise 10 ghante main puraa kiya ja rahaa he
 The 'bharatmala' project will increase the distance of this highway by about 100 kilometers to 721 kilometers, but it will take 45 minutes less to complete this distance
 nae root main 9 ghante 15 minute main hi 721 kilometre kii duuri ko puraa kiya ja sakegaa
 Thus the distance from Mumbai to Cochin National Highway is 1346 km which takes 29 hours to complete
 nae root main yah duuri badhkar 1537 kilometre ho jaaegi, lekin ise mahaj 24 ghante main puraa kiya ja sakegaa
 In the 'bharatmala' project, a network of roads will be built along the eastern and western border, 2100 km of coastal road will be built to increase tourism and industrial development
 isi prakaar purvi or pashchimi border par 3300 kilometre lambii sadake banaai jaaengi
 In this, construction of 1000 km of road will be completed in the first phase
 port connactivity ke liye 2000 kilometre sadakon kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 The port and coastal road will be constructed under 'sagarmala'

 Today England will take on Sweden in the third quarter final of the 21st edition of the FIFA World Cup at Samara Arena
 england is match ko jitkar itihaas rachana chahega
 Sweden will also have a chance to create history as any of the two teams reach the semi-finals, they will end their drought by not going into the last-4 last year
 sweden ne 1994 ke baad se kabhi bhi world cap ke semifinal main jagah nahin banaai he
 Sweden was ranked third in 1994
 england 1990 main italy main khele gaye world cap main chauthe sthaan par rahaa tha, lekin iske baad vah kabhi semifinal main kadam nahin rakh sakaa
 In such a situation, both teams will have to try to complete the deficiency that has been going on for years
 sweden ne switzraland ko maat dekar antim-8 main jagah banaai he
 England beat Colombia in a penalty shootout to enter the quarter-finals
 donon tiimon kii takat ek duusare se ulat he
 Sweden's defense is strong, then England's attack line
 match main in donon ke bich kade mukaable kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 Sweden have scored just two goals in the four matches played so far, while England have scored four goals so far if they remove the penalty shootout against Colombia
 sweden ne abhi tak chah gol kiye hai jabaki england ne nau gol kiye hai, jisamen chah gol akele uske captain harry ken ke hai
 He is at the forefront of the Golden Boot Key race
 dekhnaa yah hoga ki sweden kaa dephence england kii majboot aakraman pankti ko roak paata he yaa nahin
 However, one danger in defense for Sweden is that its players are facing suspension due to Mikael Lusting Yellow Card and will not enter this match
 vahiin uske liye acchhee baat yah he ki midfilder sebstian larsan nilamban ke baad vaapasi kar rahe hai
 In the absence of Lusting, the coach will have to make special preparations for how Sweden's defense will prevent Kane and his attack
 england kaa daaromadar captain ken par hi hoga
 On their own, England has maintained its dominance in the World Cup
 1966 world cap ke vijeta england ko bhi match se pehle ek buree khabar mili he
 There is still doubt as to whether his star player James Vardy will be able to take the field in this crucial match
 ken ke alaava midfilder jese linguard or forward khilaadi rahim sterlig ko bhi is match main ahm bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 a drawback, however, against Colombia in the previous match was that defender Kiran Tripir had created a number of chances for Kane and Lingard but both could not make it
 phinishing par england ko zyada dhyaan dene kii jarurat he

 congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf behad vivaadit bayaan diya he
 He has called PM Modi Dhritarashtra
 azamgarh main piem modi ke hamale par palatwaar karte hue surajevaala ne kaha ki haar ke dar se apana aapa khoe modi aaj pasinaa ponch-ponchkar samaaj main nafrat or bantwaare kaa jehar gholte najar aae
 The truth is that he has become blind like Dhritarashtra in the fire of revenge from the Congress party and Rahul Gandhi
 darasal, piem modi ne azamgarh main jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue rahul gandhi kii muslim samudaay se meeting par tanj ksaa
 Without naming Rahul Gandhi, he said that the Congress nominees are saying that his party belongs to Muslims
 isse pehle manmohan singh kah chuke the ki desh ke sansadhano par pehla haq musalamaanon kaa he, lekin congress ye bataae ki unki party muslim purushon kii he yaa muslim mahilaon kii bhi he?is dauranmodine teen talaak kanoon par adnga lagaae jane ko lekar bhi congress ko jamkar kosa
 Attacking the Congress, he said that these people sit in Parliament pressing the law
 lakhon-karodon muslim bahanon kii maang thi ki teen talaak ko band kiya jaae, lekin in logon kii vajah se sansad main kanoon nahin paarit ho paa rahaa he
 His real face has been revealed on the issue of triple talaq
 vahiin, piem modi ke hamale par palatwaar karte surajevaala ne kaha ki jumalon kii kishti main savaar jhuuthon ke sardaar modi apni naakaamiyon ke chalate ghabaraae or baukhalaaye hue hai
 Bypassing the dignity of the Prime Minister's post, he is today joined by Rahul and Dr
 manmohan singh ke naam par jhooth gad kar desh ko bargalaate or bahakaate najar aae
 But they should know that Godse's successors can never defeat Gandhian ideology
 congress pravaktaa ne kaha ki azamgarh main piem modi jo suna rahe the, desh kii janata wo nahin sunanaa chaahati he
 Today the public wants answers to these questions
 
 
 
 
 
 - When will the black money of Rs 80 lakh crore come back from abroad? - When will 15 lakh rupees be deposited in the accounts? - When will there be two crore jobs annually? - When will the prices of diesel and petrol come down? - When will the farmer get justice? - When will the oppression of Dalit stop? - When will the border strike stop? - When will the attack on women stop? - When will the good days come? But now it seems that good days will come when PM Modi will go from power

 Thackeray has remained silent till now, and when the state elections are just a few months away, the BJP would like him to keep his mouth shut even further

 siem siddharmaiya ne kaha ki piem modi bade-bade udyogpatiyon ke karodon ke karj maaf kar sakate hai, lekin garib kisaanon kaa karj maaf nahin kar sakate
 BJP is fooling the farmers: Siddaramaiah Siddaramaiah alleged that Modi, who talks about the development of farmers, is promoting imports rather than exports of agricultural products and thus increasing the problems of farmers
 in sabake baad piem modi or bies yediurppa ek mutthi chaaval ikattha karne kaa drama kar kisaanon ko bahala rahe hai

 For the plight of the peasants, the Congress said that the people of the rich families ruled for 48 years, while the government of a chaiwala ruled for 48 months
 48 saal vaali sarkaar ne kisaanon par dhyaan nahin diya, vahiin 48 maah kii sarkaar ne kisaanon kii jindagi badalane kaa kaam kiya he

 PM Modi has also been continuously mentioning these things in his rally and has been talking about doubling the income of farmers by 2022
