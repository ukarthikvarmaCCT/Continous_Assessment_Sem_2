 Just as in Uttar Pradesh, a government bungalow was arranged for the former chief ministers by the government, the same system has been in Bihar for the last several years, which many former chief ministers are taking advantage of
 lalu prasad yadav, rabari devi, jithan ram maanjhi, jagannatha mishra or satish prasad singh, yah sabhi naam purv mukhyamantriyon ke hai jo aaj ke din bihar sarkaar dwaara aaajeevan ke liye aavantit sarkari bangalon main rah rahe hai
 In such a situation, former Chief Minister Rabri Devi has taken the initiative that the way the Supreme Court has ordered the former Chief Ministers in Uttar Pradesh to vacate their government house, it should be implemented in Bihar in the same manner
 rabari devi ne kaha he ki supreme court kaa faisla bihar main bhi lagu ho kyonki purv mukhyamantriyon ko sarkari bangalon main nahin rahanaa chahie
 Significantly, being a former Chief Minister, both Rabari Devi and Lalu Prasad have the provision of living in separate government bungalows for a lifetime, but even then Rabri Devi and Lalu Prasad live in the same bungalow 10, Circular Road with their entire families
 2005 main satta se bedakhal hone ke baad se hi rabari devi ke naam par is bangale ko aavantit kiya gaya tha
 Rabri Devi was chief minister of Bihar thrice between 1997 and 1999 and again from 1999 to 2000 and 2000 to 2005 and Lalu Prasad Yadav was chief minister of Bihar twice between 1990 and 1995 and 1995 to 1997
 in donon ke saath-saath jithan ram maanjhi, jagannatha mishra or satish prasad singh bhi purv mukhyamantri hone ke naate sarkari bangale main rah rahe hai
 Satish Prasad Singh became the Chief Minister for only 3 days in 1968
 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue purv mukhyamantri satish prasad singh ne kaha ki raajnneeti se alag hone ke baad takreeban 20 saal tak unhen koi bhi sarkari suvidha nahin mili lekin 2010 main nitish kumaar sarkaar dwaara purv mukhyamantriyon ko sarkari awaas kaa praavdhaan kaa kanoon banane ke baad hi unhen 33A, harding road bangala aavantit kiya gaya tha
 However, Satish Prasad Singh said that if the Supreme Court order or the Bihar government wants, then he will vacate this bungalow immediately
 purv mukhyamantri jagannatha mishra jinhen 41, kranti maarg sarkari bangala aavantit kiya gaya he unhone bhi supreme court ke aadesh hone par sarkari bangale ko khaali karne kii baat kahi
 After being convicted in the scam case, Jagannath Mishra is currently lodged in Ranchi Jail but his family is staying in this bungalow and he said that if the Supreme Court wants or if the Bihar government orders, then he will leave this bungalow
 jagannatha mishra 1975 se lekar 1977 or phir 1980 se lekar 1983 tathaa 1989 se lekar 1990 tak teen baar bihar ke mukhyamantri rahe
 But to all this, former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi is saying the same thing
 'ajtak' se baatcheet karte hue unhone kaha ki purv mukhyamantri ke taur par aavantit sarkari bangala agar unhen chhodana padaa to isse unke khud ke or parivaar kii jaan ko khatra hoga
 Jitan Ram Manjhi was the Chief Minister of the state for 9 months between 2014 and 2015
 unhen 12A, strand road par bangala aavantit kiya gaya he
 Along with government bungalows, all these former chief ministers will continue to get 10 policemen as house guards and bodyguards for a lifetime
 iske saath hi inhen payalat or escort ke saath ek bullate pruf gaadi bhi di gai he
 These former Chief Ministers are also getting free electricity facility at their government bungalows for life
 sarkaar kii taraf se in purv mukhyamantriyon ko 8 karmchaariyon kii suvidha bhi di gai he jinamein se ek aapt sachiv rank kaa afasar shaamil he, ek privet secretary, do stenon, teen ardli or ek driver
 Amid escalating tensions with the nda's main ally JDU, BJP President Nitin Gadkari issued a statement urging all party leaders and coalition partners to exercise restraint while speaking on issues related to the alliance
 gadakari ke bayaan ko bhaajapa ke sachiv balbir punj dwaara somvaar ko jadyu ke khilaaf kii gayi tippanee kii prishthbhumi main dekha ja rahaa he
 Punj had said that BJP has not entrusted anyone to consider who is fit for the post of Prime Minister in the party and who is secular
 gadakari ne kaha ki bhaajapa kaa maananaa he ki rajg main raashtrapati chunaav ke mudde par alag alag raay hone ke baavjood gathbandhan ne aitihaasik bhoomika adaa kii he or desh ko maujuuda samasyaon se nikaalane ke liye gathbandhan aisa karata rahegaa
 He said that each NDA ally respects the stance taken by other coalition partners
 gadakari ne kaha ki main sabhi party padaadhikariyon or rajg main anya mitron se anurodh karata hum ki rajg se jude muddon par bolte samay sanyam baraten
 Sources said that Gadkari's statement came between the atmosphere of deteriorating relations between JDU and BJP
 yah vivaad us samay shuru hua jab jadyu ne raashtrapati chunaav ke liye aam
 Advocating the consensus, he spoke of supporting UPA candidate Pranab Mukherjee while the BJP was in favor of contesting elections
 takaraar us samay or bad gayi jab bihar ke mukhyamantri or jadyu netaa nitish kumaar ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kaa naam liye bina ek tarah se un par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki rajg kaa pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar dharmanirpeksh tathaa sabhi sahyogiyon ko sweekaarya hona chahie
 Amid escalating tensions between the two parties, JDU president Sharad Yadav held talks with Gadkari in the matter on Monday and both agreed to calm the growing controversy
 rajg ke sanyojak kii bhi jimmedaari nibhaa rahe yadav ne punj ke bayaan par kaha ki bhaajapa saansad, jo gujarat ke liye apni party ke maamalon ko bhi dekhte hai, unke aise asamay or ataarkik bayaan kii jarurat kya thi
 i have spoken to BJP President Nitin Gadkari
 unhen is tarah ke logon ko rokna chahie
 Such unnecessary things should not happen

 Questioning the intention of the litterateurs, Kher said, "this is being done to discredit the PM, if these people want to return then why not return everything
" ' haalanki kher ne saaf nahin kiya ki sab kuch se unka kya taatpary he
 Anupam also said that 'because my wife is in BJP, people feel that i am opposing litterateurs but it is not so, it is my personal opinion
 ' Criticizing the litterateurs' return of honor, Kher says, "all this is being done with political intent, anyway it is not that such violent incidents are happening in the country for the first time
" ' sahityakaron kii manshaa par sawaal khadaa karte hue kher ne kaha 'yah piem ko badnaam karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he, agar yah log lautaanaa hi chaahate hai to sab kuch kyon nahin lautaa dete
 However, Kher did not clarify what he meant by everything
 anupam ne yah bhi kaha ki 'kyonki meri patni bhaajapa main he isliye logon ko lag rahaa he ki main sahityakaron kaa virodh kar rahaa hum lekin aisa nahin he, yah mere nijee vichaar hai

 'bajirao-mastaani' ke baad donon apane kaam main itane biji ho gaye hai ki apane rishte main ai duriyon ko khatm bhi nahin kar paa rahe hai

 After which there was a rift between Ranveer and Deepika

 deepon kaa tyohaar deepawali andhere par ujaale kii jeet kii gaatha bhale sunaati ho, magar andhere ko haraane ke liye pracheen kaal se jo jariya ham apanaate rahe hai, ab uski roshni maddhim padati ja rahi he
 There is no oil nor wick on the festival of lights; now, amidst the light of dragon lights (china-made bulb), worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, has started
 deepawali par saje bazaar main jail rice, elidi, crystal, mataka, pipe lite, rocket elidi, urhul phool or mirchi jhaalar ke saath darjanon item hai
 There are also lamps and candles in these markets, but there is no oil and cotton wick in them
 ye diye or mombati bijli se roshan hote hai
 In front of this glow, Indians are now dying through traditional rashni
 diye jalaane kii parampara par dragon bazaar ke prahaar ke kaaran ek khaas jati ke rojiroti par bhi afat aa gai he
 For them, the festival was a year-round source of income, but now the festival is being celebrated indigenous due to foreign 'infiltration', but the method has become foreign
 mitti ke deeyon kaa kaarobaar thap pad gaya he
 Those who do business of clay lamps do not make too much lamp on Diwali
 patna ke raja bazaar main diya ke kaarobaari mathura prajapati kehete hai ki chaar-paanch saal pehle jahaan vah 20 hajaar diye aasaani se bech lete the, vahiin ab paanch hajaar diye bhi mushkil se bik pate hai
 If they believe, more than Diwali diyas are sold during marriage
 jhaalar ke kaarobaar se jude patna ke chandani market ke vyavsaai vipin kumaar kehete hai ki yun to patna main salbhar aisi liton kii bikri hoti hi rahati he, magar deepawali main isaki bikri paanch guna bad jaati he
 The market is flooded with new items regarding Deepawali
 isamen lager lite se lekar waterpruf lite tak shaamil ho gai hai
 Shopkeepers say that God-shaped lights also remain the first choice of the people
 mujeec mantra vaali lite, shiv-parvati or ganesh kii pratimaa par lite, paan ke pattey par ganesh lite bhi log pasand kar rahe hai
 Overall, now the expectations of the people are becoming smaller and the traditions of celebrating the festival are also changing

 If Hemant Karkare had no credibility, there would not have been a park named after Karkare in Goregaon, Mumbai

 shuukravaar ko isi maamle main NIA ne jab apana chargeshit pesh kiya to kaiyon ko laga ki hemanth karkare kii jaanch ko hi sandigdh bana diya gaya he
 Would such an officer who did not even care for his life do such an investigation that a theory of terrorism would float in the air that no one is ready to believe
 maharashtra main police cover karne vaale patrkaar bataate hai ki hemanth karkare jaanch puri kar kai dinon tak intazaar karte rahe taaki koi jaldbaazi na ho jaae
 He was stepping into the blaze so that his investigation does not come under the scanner
 hemanth karkare ne jaanch kaa kaam sambhalate hi team se poocha tha ki sirf dharm ke aadhaar par jaanch kyon ho rahi he
 Why is there no investigation on any other line
 hemanth karkare kii saakh na hoti to mumbai ke goregaanv main karkare ke naam par ek park nahin hota
 There is also a park in Pune
 2010 main maalegaanv kii ek sadak kaa naam bhi hemanth karkare ke upar rakhaa gaya he
 In 2009, Bihar's capital Patna also has a road named Hemant Karkare Road
 chennai kii ek sanstha bhi hemanth karkare ke naam par puraskaar detii he
 Kavita Karkare, wife of Hemant Karkare, also donated all the body parts after his death
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri rahete hue narendra modi ne jab ek karod kaa inaam dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi tab hemanth karkare kii patni kavita karkare ne asweekaar kar diya tha or kisi bhi rajaneta se milane se inkaar kar diya tha
 While presenting the charge sheet in the Malegaon blast case, Director General of NIA Sharad Kumar was asked by the journalist that the NIA had been opposing the accused of the Malegaon blast at first
 kya ab usne apana stand badal liya he
 So he said, 'we had to depend on the ATS investigation till our investigation was complete
 ab hamane jaanch puri kar lee he
 Therefore, we have filed the final chargesheet
 ' The news agency PTI has published this statement of the NIA Chief
 hemat karkare kii team ne sadhvi pragna or paanch anya ke kilaaf kuch to saboot jutaye honge tabhi to wo itnaa aage tak gaye
 Sadhvi Pragya and Lt Col Purohit have been in jail for seven years
 kya yah kah dena kaaphi he ki paryaapt saboot nahin he
 Shouldn't it be told how the evidence behind the imprisonment for seven years was tampered with
 yah maamla tamaam court kii nigaah se bhi guzarataa rahaa he
 The motorcycle which was in the name of Sadhvi Pragya and the one on which the blast went
 isi aadhaar par aarope laga
 Sadhvi said that her car was used by a colleague for two years, so she does not have a role
 agency kii daleel thi ki sahakarmi aapke saath kaam kar rahaa he
 The car has come here and there are some people in the middle of it who have been killed
 in sab baton par vistaar se tabhi kaha ja saktaa he jab chargeshit main kya likhaa he aap jaan paayenge
 But has the NIA absolved the right-wing organization Abhinav Bharat
 kya enie ne leftinent karnal purohit ko aarope mukt kar diya he
 There are still alleged charges against ten people
 leftinent karnal purohit ke kilaaf barood supplai karne, bam rakhane or saazish ke aarope ab bhi hai
 In the 2006 and 2008 separate Malegaon blasts, the accused has two names
 enie maanati he ki ye do log in dhamaakon main kathith rup se sakriy the
 The names of members of right-wing organization Abhinav Bharat are also in this charge sheet
 tippaniyan MCOCA has been removed against Sadhvi Pragya and Five because no evidence of applying MCOCA has been found
 to kya isse jaanch kii disha badal gai yaa sirf sadhvi pragna ko raahat pahunchaai gai kyonki vipaksh unke bijepi or sangh ke netaaon se rishte ke kaaran sangh ko bhi ghaseet letaa tha
 Since last year, there were indications through the media that Sadhvi Pragya could be relieved
 chargeshit daayar hote hi congress ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne enie kaa naam namo invastegative agency bana diya jiskaa kaam bhaajapa samarthakon ko clin chit dena rah gaya he
 Randeep Surjewala said that Modi ji should not tarnish his integrity by questioning the integrity of Hemant Karkare, who investigated Malegaon
 kendriya mantri muqataar abbaas naqvi ne kaha ki ham sahi ko chodenge nahin, galat ko fansaayenge
 The BJP also alleged that the UPA has implicated many people unnecessarily
 indian express kii report ke anusaar abhiyojan paksh ke vakil yani sarkari vakil avinaash rasaal ne kaha he ki unhen is baat kii jaankaree nahin thi ki chargeshit daayar kii ja rahi he
 i am sad and may resign
 ab unhone istife se inkaar kiya he or kaha he ki jis tarah se junior sarkari vakil ko aage karke adaalat main chargeshit pesh kii gai he usase wo naaraaz hai
 Earlier, Rohini Sanyal also said that there is pressure on him that some NIA officers are asking him to slow down in this matter
 tab kaaphi hangaamaa hua tha
 Our colleague Srinivasan Jain spoke to him in July last year
 shuukravaar ko unhone baat karne se inkaar kar diya lekin unke is intervyuu ko aap dekh sakate hai
 Easy is in English
 kaise is maamle kii ek sarkari vakil sab kuch hota hua dekh rahi thi
 Rohini Sanyal has been associated with this case from the beginning
 tab bhi jab maharashtra aties ise dekh rahi thi or tab bhi jab enie ne 2011 main ise apane haath main liya tha

 sarkaar ne spasht kiya he ki jammu kashmir bharat kaa abhinn or atoot hissaa he or yah china ko ucchtam staron sahit kai avasaron par spasht kar diya gaya he
 China has illegally occupied 43,180 square kilometers of India
 soochna ke adhikaar (artiai) ke tahat videsh mantralay ke china prabhag se mili jaankaree ke mutabik varsh 1962 ke baad se jammu kashmir main bharat kii bhoomi kaa lagbhag 38 hajaar varg kilometre bhubhag china ke kabje main he
 According to the information received from the Ministry, 'in addition, the so-called China signed between China and Pakistan on 2 March 1963
 pakistan 'seemaa qaraar' ke tahat pakistan ne paak adhikrut kashmir ke 5180 varg kilometre kshetra ko avaidh rup se china ko de diya tha
 ' videsh mantralay ne kaha, 'jammu kashmir rajya bharat kaa abhinn or atoot hissaa he or yah baat ucchtam staron sahit kai avasaron par china ko spasht kar di gayi he
 This statement of the Ministry of External Affairs is important at a time when the relationship between the two countries is tense regarding China's 'one belt, one road'
 yah galiyara pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir se hokar gujarata he 
 That is why India boycotted the conference held on China's 'one Belt, One Road'
 loksabhaa main kuch samay pehle pesh dastavejon main mantralay ne kaha tha ki saal 1996 main china ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati chyang chemin kii bharat yatra ke dauraan donon deshon ne elesi par sainya kshetra main vishwaas bahaali ke kadam ke bare main samjhaute par hastakshar kiye the
 During the visit of the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to China in June 2003, each of the two sides agreed to appoint a special representative in this regard to explore the possibility of creating a framework for resolving the border issue
 is vishay par ab tak donon pakshon kii kai baithken ho chuki he lekin seemaa vivaad par koi pragati hoti nahin dikh rahi he
 The comments soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat videsh mantralay se yah poocha tha ki china ne bharat ke kitne kshetra par kabja kar rakhaa he or is bare main sarkaar ne kya pahal kii he
 Defense expert Rahul K
 Bhosle said that the border issue has been under discussion for the last 30 years but no result is coming out and a large area is still occupied by China and encroached into Indian territory along the Line of Actual Control
 The incidents also continue
 unhone kaha ki vastav main china kii aisi gatividhiyon se sachet hone kii jarurat he or uskaa iraadaa bilkul spasht he
 We have to look at our policy in the strategic perspective in the post-1962 situation in China
 samrik maamalon ke jaankaar rajeev nayan ne kaha ki hamaari niti kaaphi rakshaatmak najar aati he or china isi kaa phayda uthaata he
 We should raise this subject effectively at the international level and increase defense and other relations with countries like Japan, Vietnam and Singapore
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The Ministry of External Affairs said, "the state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral and unwavering part of India and this has been made clear to China on many occasions including the highest levels
" ' videsh mantralay kaa yah bayaan aise samay main mahatvapurn he jab china ke 'van belt, van road' ko lekar donon deshon ke rishte tanaavpurn hai
 This corridor passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 isi kaaran bharat ne china ke 'van belt, van road' par yojit sammelan kaa bahishkaar kiya tha
 In documents presented to the Lok Sabha some time ago, the ministry said that during the visit of the then Chinese President Chiang Chemin to India in 1996, the two countries had signed an agreement on LAC regarding confidence building steps in the military
 june 2003 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii china yatra ke dauraan donon pakshon main se prayek ne is bare main vishesh pratinidhi niyukt karne par sahmati jataai thi taaki seemaa mudde ke samaadhaan kaa dhaancha taiyaar karne kii sambhaavna talaashi ja sake
 There have been several meetings of both sides on this subject so far but there is no progress on the border dispute
 tippaniyan Under the Right to Information Ministry, the Ministry of External Affairs was asked about how much territory India has occupied by China and what initiatives the government has taken in this regard
 raksha maamalon ke visheshgy rahul ke bhonsle ne kaha ki pichley 30 saal se seemaa mudde par charchaa chal rahi he lekin iskaa koi nateeja nahin nikal rahaa he or ek bada kshetra abhi bhi china ke kabje main he or vaastavik niyantran rekha par bhartiya kshetra main atikaraman kii ghatnaayen bhi jari he
 He said that indeed there is a need to be aware of such activities of China and its intention is very clear
 hamen china ke sandarbh main 1962 ke baad kii sthiti main samrik paripeksh main apni niti ko dekhnaa hoga 
 Strategic affairs expert Rajiv Nayan said that our policy looks quite defensive and China takes advantage of it
 hamen antarrashtriya str par is vishay ko prabhavi dhang se uthaanaa chahie or japan, vietnam or singapore jaise deshon se raksha evam anya sambandhon ko badhanaa chahie

 )(is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) For a minute, let us look at the title chosen by the magazine's editors for this series
 jaisaa ki ham sabhi jaanate hai, hindutv kaa arth he, ''hindu vichaar, dharm or aasthaa kaa saar
 "if that is the case then the title of this article should have been" Hindu and Hindutva "as a pair
 lekin agar ise ''banaam" shabd se alag kar diya he to isaki vajah bhi he
 The title "hindu versus Hindutva" is perfectly justified because the former title is open-minded and inclusive despite many shortcomings while the latter is radical
 isamen daliton, musalamaanon, isaayiyon or hindu aasthaa ke alaava kisi anya ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Another thing we should never forget is that the idea of hindutva is the heritage of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its affiliated Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 hinduvad or hindutv main ek abhishaap samaan he, or vah he jati vyavastha
 Especially the part of which the untouchables, which we nowadays call Dalits, are excluded from the society
 dow
 Ambedkar tried to remove this curse of untouchability by converting his people to Buddhism
 yah baat bahes kaa vishay he ki unke is kadam se daliton kii sthiti main badlaav aayaa ki nahin
 When election time comes, all the big political parties try to woo Dalits by luring them more reservation in jobs and educational institutions
 chunaav khatm hote hi sab kuch phir se pehle jaisaa ho jaataa haih choti jati ke hindu ek baar phir se utpeeda kaa shikaar ho sakate hai
 Both Congress and BJP loudly claim that they do not make any difference between the alleged big castes and Dalits among Hindus
 lekin hakeekat yahi he ki donon hi fark karti hai
 Yet there is a significant difference in the views of both parties
 pracheen itihaas kaa adhyayan hamen bataata he ki aaryon ne bahut samay pehle bharat par hamalaa kiya or ve yaheen bas gaye
 Hindutva thinkers like to believe that they have preserved the blood of Aryans for thousands of years
 golwalkar or unke jaisi soch rakhane waalon ne arya shuddhta or shreshthata kaa vah jhootha myth yahaan bhi apanaaya jise hitler or uski phacist fouj ne prachaarit kiya tha
 Therefore, despite Ambedkar's fluent praise on behalf of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the RSS and the BJP disregard the Dalits
 yah virodhabhas hi he ki hindu samaaj (hindutv nahin) ke ek varg ke bheetar jati vyavastha kii atyant katu aalochana kii gai he
 They strongly say that the label of Dalit should be removed and included in the society and they should be given adequate space in education and jobs
 yahi vajah he ki tamaam khaamiyon ke baavjood hindu dharm bharat main ab bhi sabase udaar or samaveshi he
 The Constitution of India is the most secular and liberal in this part of the world because of Gandhiji, Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Vallabhbhai Patel, Ambedkar and most of the leaders of our freedom movement
 lekin yah bayaan tabhi tak sahi he jab tak ki ham iske shabdon or isaki bhaavana par amal karte hai
 The greatest quality of Hinduism was its inclusion
 isaki baanhen hameshaa un logon ke swaagat ke liye khuli thim jo isaki sharan main aae yaa jo iske saath jude
 Parsis were the first among the settlers who arrived in India
 iske baad kuch muslim akramanakari yahaan aae or unhone bharat ko lutaa
 Some even committed terrible massacres
 iske baavjood hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki is upmahadweep main basane vaale bahut se akramanakariyon ne nishpakshta or saumy tareeke se yahaan shashan kiya
 For example, the Mughals raised India's pride in many respects
 iske baad portugali isai aae or phir angrejon ne 300 varshon tak yahaan upnivesh banaaya
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the first BJP Prime Minister at that time and Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat when fierce riots took place in Gujarat
 mote anumaanon ke anusaar kareeb ek hajaar se zyada musalmaan un dangon main maare gaye the or kai hajaar musalamaanon ko apana ghar-baar chhodia padaa tha
 We should not forget the rebuke of Prime Minister Vajpayee in which he had said to the Chief Minister Narendra Modi that "this is not Rajdharma"
 " nishpakshta ke saath kahen to vaajapeyi ke hindutv kaa najariya kahin zyada udaar tha or unke mantrimandal main arun shouri tathaa yashavanth sinha jaise apane-apane kshetra ke behtareen visheshgyon ko jagah di gai thi
 It has been more than three years since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister
 tamaam saahasik baton ke baavjood ve khud ko asurakshit mahasoos karte hai or unhone apane irdagird ausat darje ke logon ko cabinet main bitha rakhaa he
 His association with the RSS is not only in a more open form, but is seen in a very aggressive new avatar of Hindutva
 ab tak desh main koi musalmaan-virdohi danga to nahin hua he lekin sarkaar kii maun sahmati ke saath jo chal rahaa he, vah kahin zyada khatarnaak he
 We must understand forever that even though our constitution is not sacred for the Hindutva brigade, it is a cow
 itani pavitra ki bechaari gaay sadakon par bhukhi chhod di jaati he or use plastic kii vifailli theliyon se pet bharne ko majaboor hona padataa he jabaki bhaajapa sarkaar ne gohatya or bif khaane tathaa uski bikri ko sangyeya aparaadh ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 Because of this, thousands of Muslims have lost their livelihood overnight
 yahaan yah ullekh karnaa jaruri he ki desh kaa nagirak jo kuch bhi khaataa he, vah samvidhan main niztaa ke kanoon ke tahat aata he
 But the most disappointing aspect of cow politics is that it is another example of our ignorance about Hindutva, whereas culture, history and mythological texts find mention separately
 unhen shaayad yah pataa nahin he ki vedon ke anusaar anek dharmik anushthanon main gaay kii bali di jaati thi
 People like Dinanath Batra, a symbol of narrow-mindedness, are considered intellectuals and the Prime Minister himself proudly cites the example of Lord Ganesha, telling us that our ancestors knew the technique of transplanting organs
 hindutv ke kuch zyada hi utsaahi or gyani vidwaanon ko yah daawa karne main koi hichak nahin hoti he ki taj mahal mul rup se mandir tha
 Even vice-president Venkaiah Naidu accused the Mughals (and the British) of plundering, destroying and betraying the country
 kya koi uparashtrapati mahoday ko batayega ki 1857 ke vidroh ke samay ek lakh brahman sainikon ne aakhri mughal badshaah ke samarthan main dilli kii taraf march kiya tha or unhen singhaasana par baithaaya tha?baharhaal, bif par pratibandh kuch or nahin balki gaay kii raajnneeti he or musalamaanon ko utpeedit karne tathaa saream maut ke ghat utaarne kaa ek bahaanaa he ki ve kanoon tod rahe hai
 The so-called cow guards are repeatedly killing innocent people
 yahaan ham sirf ek udhaaharan lete hai
 55-year-old Pekhar Khan was beaten to death in Alwar district of Rajasthan, while papers found near him showed that he had bought cows in a legitimate manner
 us ghatana ke liye jimmedaar paanch hatyaron ko girakrataar kiya gaya tha or unhone apana jurm sweekaar bhi kiya tha
 a new pattern has been created in existing jurisprudence
 aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf exiar darj kar lee gayi lekin kuch din jail main rakhane ke baad unhen chupchaap chhod diya gaya
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was accused in several cases a few years ago, yet he was allowed to withdraw charges against himself
 is kahani kaa sabak he—hindutv par amal karne ke laabhon main se ek yah haih nirdosh kii hatya or doshiyon tathaa hatyaron ko dand se mukti
 When foreign media questioned about these incidents, Narendra Modi showed greatness and said that strict action will be taken against those who kill Muslims
 lekin iske baad chuppi bani rahi
 In three years, the Prime Minister, the biggest representative of Hindutva, has taught us that speech is its place and action is its place, both are different things
 hindutv shashan kii sabase khatarnaak or aakhirkaar aatmavinashi pariyojnaon main yah rahi he ki puraani baton ko bade soche-samajhe tareeke se bhula diya jaataa he
 Gandhiji, Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and other leaders and ordinary citizens, who won the first battle in the world by fighting the freedom struggle with the weapon of non-violence, have "disappeared"
 gandhi ji ko keval ''swatchta" abhiyaan ke kisi kaarykram ke samay yaad kiya jaataa he
 i conclude with an excerpt from that extraordinary and intelligent speech of President Richard von Weiszackers on the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War: "young and old generations helping each other to understand And they must explain why it is important to keep our memories alive
 yah ateet ko sudhaarney kaa maamla nahin he
 it's not possible

 But one who turns a blind eye to the past, becomes blind to the present
 jo koi kisi kii amanviyata ko yaad nahin karata he vah nae khatre ke sankraman kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 "I will appeal to Shri Bhagwat of RSS and all the leaders of Hindutva and their millions of supporters to start this speech, starting with Prime Minister Modi

 Now on March 28 at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, all traders of Delhi will hold a big rally against the government
 dilli ke sabhi chote-bade vyapaaree sanghathan is raily main bhaag lenge
 Earlier, the resolution against sealing was also passed on the first day of the Delhi Assembly, but there was also a lot of resentment among the traders
 vyapari sanghathan cat ke mahasachiv praveen khandelwal ne kaha ki dilli vidhansabha main ceiling ke khilaaf prastaav paas karnaa sirf dhokhaa he, agar vaaki sarkaar chintit hoti to wo bill lekar aati lekin is tarah ke prastaav kaa koi matlab nahin he
 In fact, against sealing, the traders had closed Delhi on March 13, but now they want to increase the pressure on the government by organizing a big rally
 vyapaariyon kaa aarope he, chaahe centre kii sarkaar ho yaa phir dilli sarkaar donon hi sarkaar khel rahi hai
 Till now no one has given any solution but the phase of accusation continues

 Which was getting lost somewhere amid the glare of cricket
 lekin badalte vakt ne is khel ko ab us jagah par laakar khadaa kar diya he
 Where he is not currently challenging cricket, but is seen daring to stand in front of him
 cricket ko chunauti detii kabaddiagar das saal pehle kaa vakt hota to shaayad ye sawaal hi bemaani hota ki kya kabddi cricket kii tarah bada khel ban paaegaa
 But today this question does not surprise

 Kabaddi's popularity increased Hackbuddy's popularity has increased a lot in recent times
 isaki vajah kabddi main bharat kaa mahashakti hona to ek kaaran he hi, pro kabddi lig ke jariye ise chakachaundh se bharaa khel bananaa bhi ek bada kaaran he
 There is a shortage of world winners in this country
 aise main kabddi ke jariye vishwa vijeta kaa ehsaas hona logon ko khud ke vishwa kaa sirmaur hone kaa ehsaas karaata he
 When the dazzle coincides with that feeling, it touches the heart
 logon kii ruchi par paini nigaah rakhane vaale praayojakon ne jab dekha ki cricket se itar ab logon kii ruchi kabddi kii taraf badhane lagi he to unhone is khel main bhi paisa lagaana shuru kar diya he
 Growing sponsors in the Games There was a time when the country would play hoogo poorly, read and write will become the dominance of Nawab
 lekin vakt bitne ke saath or khelon ko lekar maahaul badalane ke saath ye haalat bhi ab badali he
 Until recently, sponsors of sports and sportspersons found it difficult
 parantu ab pehle vaali baat nahin rahi
 It is true that even today there is a shortage of sponsors, but the other truth is that more money is coming in sports every year
 agar beete do saalon kii hi tulana karen to ye fark saaf najar aata he

 But among these sports, the sport that has attracted the sponsors the most is the passion of Indian sports lovers not cricket or the world's most popular sport, football, but kabaddi, a game made of native soil

 In other sports, the amount increased from 178 crores to 223 crores
 ye aankade jaahir karte hai ki cricket ke khelon main pratishat ke lihaaj se sabase zyada raashi kaa ijapha hua he

 The coming day of June 30 is officially going to be a second long, because on Tuesday our time will stop for a second
 yani aam taur par jahaan ek minute main 60 second hote hai, vahiin 30 june ko din kaa aakhri minute 61 second kaa hoga
 The US Space Science Agency NASA has confirmed this
 darasal, ek din main 86,400 second hote hai, lekin 30 june ko is samay main ek atirikt second yani lip second jud jayega
 According to Daniel mcmillan of Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, NASK, Maryland, "the Earth's rotation is slowly slowing down so it has added an extra leapsecond
" ' aisa koordinated universal time yani utisi ke mutabik he, jiskaa istemaal log dainik jivan main karte hai
 UTC is atomic time, where a period of one second is based on the predicted electromagnetic transition occurring in the atoms of the cesium
 ye transishan itane adhik vishwasaneey hote hai ki sisium clock 1,400,000 varshon tak sahi ho sakati he
 NASA released the nebayan, saying, 'earth's rotation is slowing down due to the force of gravity between the Earth, the Moon and the Sun
 'kyon joda ja rahaa he lip secondetomic or solar time main saamanjasy ke liye 1 janvari 1960 ko utisi kii vyavastha laai gai
 Since 1972, the UTC has been modified to add leap seconds if needed
 iske liye june yaa disambar main aakhri minute main ek atirikt second joda jaataa he
 The addition of additional seconds is done by the International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service
 aise main in do maap mulyon ke tulykaalan ke liye 30 june ke aakhri minute main samay ek second ke liye ruk jayega
 As soon as this happens, the last minute will be 61 seconds
 kya lip year kii tarah he lip secondalip year ke niyam ke tahat har chaar saal par calendar main ek atirikt din joda jaataa he
 This is done because the earth takes an additional time of 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds to revolve around the sun
 haalanki, isse ulat lip second kii aisi koi gananaa nahin kii ja sakati ki vah ek niyat avadhi ke baad kab joda jayega
 It depends on many things, including rotation on the Earth's own axis, mobility of the Earth's center, variations in the atmosphere, oceans, groundwater, and ice storage

 And through this, contact between the government and the people remains
 aadhaar card ke itar duniya ke kai viksit deshon main passport or driving license sabase zyada sweekaarya photo pahchaan patr hai
 But the Aadhar card of our country is very different from all these cards
 ek najar daalate hai, card kii duniya par
 
 
 The tradition of the introduction cards of cards from France is not very old in the world
 isse sambandhit itihaas kii shuruyaat kareeb sava 2 sau saal pehle hui thi
 In 1803-04, France became the first country in the modern world to introduce an identity card for its citizens
 nepolian ke samay main bhi card jari kiye gaye the, lekin tab iskaa makasad kaamkaaji logon kii harkaton par najar rakhana or unhen kam mazdooree dena tha
 During the job, the employee had to give his card to the employer and in case of change of job, the card had to be taken from them
 lekin kisi bhi niyokta se yah card lenaa itnaa aasaan nahin hota tha
 The SC asked the UP government - no baseless homeless exist? In 1839 Sultan mahmud-ii of the Ottoman Empire in Turkey issued a nationally based identity card in view of the increasing invasion and intervention of other European powers in his country, So that outsiders can be curbed
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke shuruyaat main 1938 main england or germany ne apane-apane nagarikon ke liye pahchaan patr anivaary kar diya
 France also implemented it in 1940
 germany or france ne card isliye jari kiye taaki yahudiyon kii pahchaan aasaan ho jaae or unhen nishane par liya ja sake
 England declared not to abolish the card system after the war and to continue it
 aadhaar ke bachaav main utre nilekani, bole- badnaam karne ke liye chalaai campandusre vishwa yuddh ke baad 1949 main hong cong or taiwan ne china se uske kshetra main aane vaale logon kii pahchaan ke liye pahchaan patr kii shuruyaat kii
 In 1958, China introduced the Hukou Registration Regulation through which it could provide essential things to the destitute people, as well as to curb the possible movement against the country
 1960 ke dashak main dakshin korea or singapore ne bhi rashtriya str par pahchaan patr kii shuruyaat kar di
 Today's situation has changed today and the world has become very small
 lekin suraksha or anya chizon ke lihaaj se pahchaan patr behad jaruri ho gaya he
 Let's take a look at how people are identified today
 australiah1987 or 2007 main aise 2 prastaav nijee suraksha kaa hawala dete hue radd kiye ja chuke hai
 Here driving license, tax file number and Medicare number are used as identity cards
 ruspaise naagarik jinaki umr 14 saal se upar kii he or jo log rus main rahanaa chaahate hai unhen aantarik passport banvaanaa hota he
 It also has to be renewed at the age of 20 and 45 years
 china16 saal ke upar ke nagarikon ko awaas pahchaan patr ke liye aavedan karnaa jaruri hota he
 Japan: My Number Law (2013) gives a number to each of its citizens, containing personal information related to tax, social security, and disaster relief from the central and local governments
 englandleidentity documents act 2010 ke aane ke baad aaidentity card act 2006 ko khatm kar diya gaya tha
 This documents contains information like driving license, passport, age certified card
 americadesh main koi rashtriya card vyavastha nahin he
 Driving license, passport, social security card, state icard, military CAC card are used as identity cards
 francerashtriya str par pahchaan patr ke jariye puure europe or france ke aupniveshik shashan ke antargat rahe deshon main gum sakate hai, saath hi iske jariye bank khaataa bhi khulwaaya ja saktaa he
 Germany: An identity card or passport is mandatory, but citizens are free to include fingerprints in their identity cards
 brazilarashtriya str par gaiyr-jaruri card, jise arji card kaha jaataa he, saath hi driving license or passport bhi jaruri he
 On the other hand, Aadhaar card has been made compulsory for all citizens in India, a 12-digit biometric card that is mandatory for all citizens in the country
 isamen har naagarik kii photo, haath kii 10 anguliyon ke nishaan or ankhon kii putali khinche jate hai
 Through this, the common people get all government facilities, bank account and other necessary information

 While the BJP has lost power in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, there is a thorn in MP
 telugana main bijepi kinggmekar banane kii jugat main thi, lekin party ko tagada jhatka laga he
 In the state, BJP reduced from five seats to 1 seat
 telugana kii 119 siton vaali vidhansabha main kesiar kii tsunami main bijepi puri tarah saaf ho gai he
 However, the BJP had made every effort to feed the lotus
 pradhanmantri narendra modi, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se lekar upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne jamkar prachaar kiya tha
 The TRS looks like a strong fort in the state of Telangana in 2014
 kesiar ne paanch saal main jis tarah se apni party or sanghathan kaa vistaar kiya he
 They have also turned into an election result
 jabaki bijepi sahit congress or duusari partiyon ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa he
 The BJP aimed to win more than 20 seats in Telangana
 lekin is sankhya ke aankade ko chune ke bajaay apane puraane ricard ko bhi barkaraar nahin rakh saki
 The party previously had 5 mlas, but now this number has come down to one
 telugana vidhansabha chunaav main tiares 88 siton ke saath do tihaai bahumat ke saath satta main duusari baar vaapasi kii he
 At the same time, Congress is getting 19 seats, Asaduddin Owaisi's party AIMIM 7 and TDP 2 others get 3 seats
 jis desh ke system kii soch main javabdehi naa ho, jis desh ke system ko nagarikon kii jaan kii parvaah naa ho
 How can a new India be built with a system of zero accountability, the country whose system is able to protect itself even after major accidents
 kyonki pichley 15 din main desh ne do aise haadase dekhe hai, jise haadasa nahin balki hamaare system kaa krur aparaadh hi kaha ja saktaa he
 Utkal train accident on Saturday is the latest example of this, where the train ran at a speed of 100 km leaving a broken railway track and this negligence took the lives of 22 people
 150 se zyaada logon kii jaan jane se bachi
 The truth is that we were sorry that the death toll remained at 22
 nahin to hamaare system ne koi kasar nahin chodi thi, jinhen logon kii jaan kii parvaah nahin he
 Such bureaucracy is criminal
 lekin afsos ye he ki jimmedaari or javabdehi tay nahin hoti
 At the same time, due to the negligence of the system in Gorakhpur, more than 60 children died in a week and then a committee was formed in the name of investigation
 utkal rail haadase me 8 afasaron par ection to liya gaya he
 But sending on suspend, transfer and leave will not help, because such people will come back into the system
 inkaa koi kuch bigaad nahin paata he
 If everything changes, if everything changes, it is necessary to punish such criminal system, otherwise every slogan will prove to be hollow, as it has been till now
 new india kaa slogan sunne main acha lagata he
 Everything can change from the point of view that thinking is also important
 lekin kya new india tab tak banaaya ja saktaa he
 As long as that system has got a habit of zero accountability, for which the citizens of the country have no value
 koi sammaan nahin he
 They are watching everything from the death of children in Gorakhpur to the train accident in Muzaffarnagar
 khatauli main train accidantodisha ke puri se haridwar ja rahi utkal express kaa haadasa naa hota
 Had this system cared for the lives of people at all
 22 logon kii jaan chali gai, 156 logon kii jaan jate-jate bachi
 The train was running at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour on the broken track - the repair work was going on on the railway track, the officials were sitting silently
 - patari kaatane ke baad welding kiye bagaiyr karmchaaree adhikari gaayab ho gaye
 - The station master was not aware that the track lay open 700 meters ahead
 - plateform par rail karmchaaree hari jhandi lekar khadey rahe, or phul speed main train nikal gai
 - The accident was ready ahead, 23 coaches were derailed, 6 coaches were in bad condition
 1 dibba to paas ke ghar main jaakar ghus gaya
 It was a pity that only 22 people fell prey, otherwise what was left behind by the system in making the figure even higher
 logon ko bachaane kaa kaam to hota rahaa
 But the work of protecting itself has already started by the Railways
 jab trek par kaam kii baat hi nahin maan rahe the, bina javabdehi sabko bachaane kii koshish kii to gai
 But this will keep happening every time
 maut kaa mazaaq bana dene vaale system kii is aadat par chot kii shuruyaat honi chahie
 After the preliminary investigation, the Railways has taken action on 8 officers in the Utkal train accident
 - pehali baar aise haadase par secretary level ke railway board adhikari ko suspend kiya gaya
 - Three such top level officers were sent on leave
 - jisamen railway board ke member ejeeniyar, uttar railway ke general manager, divisional manager shaamil he
 Apart from this, Assistant Engineer Meerut, Section Engineer Muzaffarnagar, Junior Engineer Khatauli were suspended
 - chif trek ejeeniyar ko transfar kar diya gaya he
 The accountability of the system will be determined by such drastic action, and if these accountability is not fixed, then even if governments change
 koi bhi aa jaae
 Such carelessness will not stop
 aise haadase nahin rukenge or aisi gaiyr javabdehi vaali soch se kam se kam new india to kabhi nahin banegaa
 It is a matter of fact that according to the large railway system, according to that, our accidents are still very few according to the international track record
 lekin baat mishan zero accident kii he
 It is to create a system where there is no accident, it is to create a system where the responsible people of the accident cannot escape
 rajnatik aalochana se bachane ke liye apni kamiyon par jab tak paradaa daalane kii koshish hoti rahegi
 Those responsible will remain after the accidents
 tab tak system thik karnaa bahut mushkil he
 This is the reason why we have become used to railway accidents
 - pichley 5 saal main 586 rail haadase ho chuke hai, jisamen 53 fisadi haadase direl hone se hue
 Due to derailment, since November 2014, there have been about 20 big and small train accidents
 - rail mantralay ne ye daawa kiya he ki pichley 3 saal main train accident main kami ai he
 135 accidents occurred in 2014–15, down from 107 in 2015–16 and 104 in 2016–17
 - rail mantralay kaa daawa he ki upie-1 ke teen saal main 759, upie-2 ke teen saal main 938 or modi sarkaar ke teen saal main 652 haadase hue hai
 - The Ministry claims that security measures are being taken from improving the track to building the detection system and installing anti-collision coaches
 - pichley saal ke bajet main mishan zero accident kaa zikr tha jisamen do pahalu par kaam kiya ja rahaa he, jisamen 2020 tak unmanned level crossings ko puri tarah se hataanaa or takkar-direlment se bachaana kaa system taiyaar karnaa focus he
 - There is talk of equipping the railways with 40 thousand Linke Hofmann Busch coaches equipped with safety features in the next five years
 jaisaa ki gorakhpur main bacchon kii maut par hua, jahaan sirf aspataal str par hi ection liya gaya
 As in the Utkal train accident, initially there was an unsuccessful attempt to cover up the cause of the accident
 system ko javabdeh tab hi banaaya ja saktaa he
 When the crime of the system is not concealed with the citizens resulting from negligence and neglect
 khud ko aalochana se bachaane ke liye jimmedaar logon ko bachaaya naa jaae
 The employee management dispute at Maruti's Manesar plant has deepened
 manesar plant main prabandhan ke khilaaf hadtaal kar rahe karmchaariyon ko sujuki ke teen ore plant ke karmchaariyon kaa samarthan mil gaya he

 Already, speculations were being made that there would be major changes in the organization before Rahul Gandhi was made Congress President and now his changes have also been announced
 congress ne apanepanch pradesh adhyakshonko badal diya he
 Ajay Maken has been given the command of Delhi Congress
 iske alaava sanjay nirupam ko maharashtra, ashok chavaan ko maharashtra, gulam mir ko jammu-kashmir or uttam kumaar ko telugana congress kaa pradesh adhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 According to sources, these five leaders are of Rahul Gandhi's choice
 khabaron ke mutabik in badlaavon ke bare faisla rahul gandhi ke chuttee par jane se pehle hi ho gaya tha
 In Gujarat, Bharat Singh Solanki has already been made the state president in place of Arjun Modhwadia
 dilli main congress kii kaman arvinder singh lavali ke paas thi, lekin vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko ek bhi seat na milane kaa khamiyaja lavali ko bhugatna padaa
 However, now Maken, who was made state president, could not save his seat in the assembly elections
 abhi to paanch pradesh adhyaksh hi badale gaye hai, lekin jald hi punjab ke pradesh congress adhyaksh bhi badale ja sakate hai
 In Punjab, the party may replace former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh as state president in place of p Bajwa
 bataaya jaataa he punjab pradesh congress kamity ke adhyaksh bajva rahul gandhi kii pasand the, lekin nagar nikaay chunaavon main karaari haar ke baad amarinder gut ne bajva par hamale tej kar die hai
 However, the appointment of Amarinder Singh is yet to be approved
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kaa kahana he ki adarsh houseing ghotaale kii jaanch kii gati dhimi pad gai he
 The scam is being investigated by a two-member commission constituted by the CBI and the state government
 unhone mangalvaar ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘sibiai ko bhoomi ke malikana haq kii jaanch kerani thi
 Its speed has slowed down
 ’’unhone kaha ki vah ucch nyaayalay ke avkaash praapt nyaayadhish je
 a
 patil ke netritv vaale ayog se jaanch ko sheeghra puraa karne kaa aavedan karenge
 Chavan admitted that it would be difficult to set a time limit for the investigation
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ayog ko kaarykaal vistaar diya gaya he
 a time limit cannot be set
 ’’ ashok chavaan ke saath baithak ke bare main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ‘yah koi gopneey baithak nahin thi
 "he said," i went to meet the local legislators to discuss the issue of development in the circuit house
 ashok chavaan ne mujhe phone karke apane ghar chaay par bulaayaa or vidhayakon kii baithak bhi unke ghar par hi hui
 When asked about the upcoming civic elections, he said that we need to be careful
 congress par bhartiya janata party kaa hamalaandruni ladaai ke liye rahul ko bataaya jimmedaarkendriya mantri mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kiya varloksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar milane ke baad or aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav se pehle congress main bayaanbaji kii bahaar ai he
 The veteran leaders of the party are constantly talking about self-determination, now the Bharatiya Janata Party has also advised the Congress on this
 bijepi netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne kaha he ki congress ke ghar main jo aag lagi he, wo unke hi chasham-o-chiraag ne lagaai he
 Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that his leader (rahul Gandhi) is on leave himself, sending the entire Congress on leave
 wo raajnneeti ko lekar kitne gambhir hai, ye sabhi ko dikhaai de rahaa he
 He said that when there is a confusion in policies, then there is a division in leadership
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue bijepi netaa ne kaha ki acha he ki puri congress milakar aatmachintan kaa mahayajna kar le, congress jo nakaaratmak raajnneeti kii he, ye usee kaa parinaam he
 Voices are constantly rising in the Congress
 Let me tell you that there has been a continuous rebellion in the Congress, even when former party president Rahul Gandhi was on a foreign tour
 buudhvaar ko hi purv saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya ne is masale par bayaan diya tha or kaha tha ki congress ko aage badhane ke liye aatmachintan kii jarurat he
 It is necessary to take stock of the situation of the Congress, so that the party can be taken forward
 jyotiraditya sindhiya ke bayaan se pehle purv kendriya mantri salmaan khurshid ne bhi aisa hi kaha tha ki congress ko apni sthiti sudhaarney ke liye aatmachintan kii jarurat he
 He had said that due to today's conditions many people have left the party, in such a situation the party needs to think once again
 ise padhein: congress main kalah par bole sindhiya- party ko aage badhaane ke liye aatmachintan jaruricongress kaa kya he haal?aapako bataa den ki loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar ke baad congress main aapasi kalah khulkar saamne aa gai thi
 First Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of president, after that the rebellion in the state units was intensified
 maharashtra main is vakt sanjay nirupam banaam milind devda kaa vivaad he, to rajasthan main ashok gahalot banaam sachin payalat kii ladaai chal rahi he

 uttar pradesh kii kaarysmiti kii baithak ke duusare or antim din ravivaar ko party kii taraf se raajnneetik prastaav pesh kiya gaya
 In this, the BJP has counted the achievements of the Yogi of the state and the Modi government at the center, claiming that the state is in safe hands

 vahiin khargon jile kaa ek gaanv beete 3 saal se boond-boond pani ke liye taras rahaa he
 The people of this village are alleged that they are getting this punishment because of the village sarpanch because they did not vote for them in the Gram Panchayat elections
 sarpanch suman more bijepi se judi hai
 About 20 km from the district headquarters of Khargone, half the population of the village panchayat Romchichali is in need of drinking water
 aarope ke mutabik navalpura ilaake ke kareeb 300 parivaar gram panchayat chunaav main maujuuda sarpanch suman more ko vot nahin dene kii sajaa bhugat rahe hai
 The supply of drinking water in their homes is closed
 navalpura kshetra main pani kii line to hai lekin sabhi nal sookhe pade hai
 According to the villagers, since the results of the Gram Panchayat elections three years ago, this situation has remained the same for them
 aise main logon ko yaa to motor panpon kaa sahaara lenaa pad rahaa he yaa navalpura main lage iklaute handpump kaa
 But this hand pump gets so crowded that even fights arise to fill the water first
 kuen hai bhi to gaanv se do kilometre dur
 From here, women have to bring water by risking their lives
 navalpura kii rahane vaaleen nirmala bhatore kahati hai ki raat ke 2-2 baje tak pani ke liye bhatakana padataa he
 We give water to others but do not give it in our area
 vahiin banu bai ke mutabik sarpanch kaa kahana he ki vot nahin diya isliye pani nahin milegaa
 Singh Mehta, Upsarpanch of Gram Panchayat, also supports the talk of the villagers
 unka kahana he ki sarpanch ko bolne jaao to jawaab miltaa he ki pani ke liye yahaan nahin aayaa karo varanaa koi jhootha iljaam laga diya jayega
 According to Mehta, he has pleaded with the collector twice in this matter
 vahiin sarpanch suman more kii ore se unke pratinidhi or bete rahul more pani naa dene ke aaropon ko niraadhaar bataate hai
 They say that there is no discrimination
 kai log alag line se pani le rahe hai
 There is already a water problem in the village
 pani ke strot ke sthaan par10 ghante hi bijlimilti he isliye kuch sthanon par pani nahin pahunch paa rahaa he
 When contacted, Rajendra Sharma, CEO of Janpanchayatkhargon, said that he had given a proposal for supply of water in the village
 main line se kuch logon ne conection jod rakhaa tha jise katwane ke liye bol diya gaya he
 According to Sharma, the water is sufficient and the sarpanch should not have spoken like this
 sharma ne jaldi hi samasya ke samaadhaan kaa bharosa diya

 The media did not know when Rahul Gandhi matured while confronting Narendra Modi
 kabhi rahul gandhi kii chatkaredaar khabaren chhapakar tiarapy paane vaala media ab unhen gambhir rajaneta ke rup main lene laga he
 The digital media that used to run on the words of 'narendra Modi' was once guaranteed to run the news, it replaced 'rahul Gandhi' as a serious leader later this year
 yahaan gambhir kahana isliye jaruri he kyonki rahul chhapate to pehle bhi the lekin syriasli unhen koi syrius nahin letaa tha
 But it seems now Rahul Gandhi's Rahu period is over
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki unka 14 saalon kaa vanvaas bhi khatm hua
 Actually Rahul Gandhi became MP for the first time in 2004
 upie van or upie tu main das saal tak congress kii sarkaar hi centre main rahi
 It took fourteen years for the heirs of the nehru-gandhi family to bring political efficiency
 2018 main unke siyaasi safar ke kareeb-kareeb 14 saal puure ho gaye or isi ke saath madhyapradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh main aae nateezon kaa shrey bhi nisandeh unheen ko mila or milanaa bhi chahie
 In 2017, people first noticed Rahul Gandhi
 gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main unhone jis tarah bhaashan die or piem narendra modi ko chunauti dete najar aae vah kaabil-e tarif he
 His 'temple race' became the center of discussion during the election campaign
 duusari baar rahul gandhi ne apni super siyaasi samaj kaa parichay diya karnataka chunaav main
 The credit of the Congress, which is struggling with internecine, by erasing mutual differences, also goes to Rahul
 di sivakumar or siddaramaiya ke bich samjhauta karavaaya
 Then after the election results came, he brought the Janata Dal (S) in his court in a very tight manner
 badi baat yah thi ki bhaajapa chunaav main badi party ke rup main ubhari thi, par bahumat nahin tha
 Janata Dal (S) chief Kumaraswamy was invited by the BJP to become the Deputy Chief Minister
 lekin bina deree kiye rahul gandhi ne nahale par dahala chal diya or kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri banane kaa nyauta bhej diya
 BJP had to face it
 phir ai baari paanch rajyon chhattisgarh, madhyapradesh, rajasthan, telugana, mizoram ke vidhansabha chunaav kii
 Elections were held from November to December 7 of 2018 and the results were out on 11 December
 nateezon ne ek baar phir congress ko khush hone kaa mauka diya
 In particular, the Congress won in all the three states of the North
 yahaan bhi rahul gandhi siyaasi hero banakar ubhare
 However, his political opponents got a chance to take a dig at Rahul Gandhi's eye-opening parliament and then take the name of the son of the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh in place of the son of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh in the Panama paper leak case
 par rahul gandhi kii in galtiyon par jiesit ko gabbar tex kahana, chaukeedaar chor he jaise vaakya baari pade
 Such sentences went viral on social media with hashtags
 rahul gandhi ne janau se lekar gotra tak kii raajnneeti karne se parhez nahin kiya
 As Rahul matures, while on one hand there is hope within the people of India, on the other hand, there is a fear somewhere
 loktantr tabhi safal hota he jab janata ke saamne chunane ke liye ek se zyada vikalp hon
 It was extremely important to challenge PM Modi's tsunami
 so vanshavaad kii raajnneeti ke itar agar dekhen to desh kii sabase puraani or badi party ke vaaris kaa majboot hona shubh sanket he
 But the fear is that while challenging the BJP doing politics of religion, is Rahul himself doing politics of religion or not? Many times, in the process of defeating the opponent, we defeat him with his tricks
 parrast karne tak to thik he lekin agar rahul gandhi ko dharm kii raajnneeti kii lat lag gai to janata ke liye satta nahin balki keval cheharaa badalegaa kyonki vichaar satta par jas kaa tas kabiz rahegaa
 Rahul, meanwhile, defeated the BJP several times with his infallible weapon religion
 math-mandir, gotra, janeu sabakuch kaa istemaal kiya
 Rahul Gandhi must read these lines of Bulle Shah and should also think carefully
 ‘ranjha ranjha kardi ni main aape ranjha hoi
 i am the witch in Ranjha, i don't care for anyone
 ’ yani ranjha-ranjha karte-karte hir khud ranjha ho gai
 There was no difference between Heer and Ranje
 sakaaratmak vichaaron kaa ek duusare main ghul janaa thik he
 But while doing BJP-BJP, Rahul himself becoming BJP is dangerous for the health of the country
 *** There has been a political uproar after BJP MP Pragya Thakur called Mahatma Gandhi's killer Nathuram Godse a 'patriot'
 congress sattarudh bijepi par hamalavar ho gai he
 Senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi tweeted and taunted BJP
 unhone likhaa, 'chunaav main godse kaa gungan kiya to suraksha samit kaa sadsy bana diya
 Now Godse has been praised in Parliament, it seems the time has come to become a minister at the Center
 
 
 kahin raksha mantri to nahin
 Now will Modi ji reward you from his heart? He further wrote, 'pragya Thakur has also called Godse a patriot before and today again
 modi ji pehle dil se maaf nahin karne vaale the or ab shaayad kidney, liver se bhi maaf nahin kar paaenge'
 # pragyasinghthakur has previously called Godse a patriot
 
 And said again today
 
 Modi ji was not the first to forgive or ab shaayad kidni,liver,,se bhi maaf nahin kar paaenge
 # pragyasinghthakur Modi's heart, mind, mind, don't forgive the nation, whether Pragya Singh Thakur (bjp's Lok Sabha member Pragya Singh Thakur), who is the patriot of Azad India's first terrorist-traitor Godse No, but dismiss from Parliament is the demand of the country
 duusari taraf, madhya pradesh ke siem kamalnath ne likhaa, 'rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse ko deshbhakt bataane par bhopal kii bhaajapa saansad pragna thakur ko dil se kabhi maaf nahin karne kii baat kehane vaale modi ji ko ab loktantr ke pavitra mandir sansad main isi bayaan ko dohraane par saansad pragna thakur ko qatai maaf nahin karnaa chaiye
 The country will never forgive him for this statement

 jamshedpur ke gauravshaalee ateet kii kahanijab tata ne rakhi thi steel plant kii neenvphilistin tak gaya jharkhand kaa faauladbaat 100 saal se bhi zyada puraani he
 The year was 1914 and cannons were thundering in the First World War
 british sarkaar germany-austria or hungary ke saath buree tarah se jang main fansi thi
 The first war of the modern world had spread to Europe, Africa and the Middle East
 british sarkaar bade paimaane par rasad or yudhak-sajo saamaan kii supplai puri duniya main faile apane sainikon ko kar rahi thi
 The British Empire, whose sun never set, everything was at stake in this great war
 tab kii avaagaman vyavastha aaj jaisi durust nahin thi
 Goods were sent from the old model railways
 egypt, mesopotamia or purvi africa ke marusthalon main to railway kii patariyaan bhi nahin bichhi hui thi
 But there the heat of war was increasing rapidly
 in kshetron main apana kabja kaayam rakhane ke liye british hukumat ko vahaan sabase pehle or sabase teji se pahunchnaa tha
 For this, the British engineers planned to lay rail tracks in these areas
 kaam par amal bhi shuru ho gaya
 But immediately he faced a serious obstacle
 yuddh main fansaa britain itani maatra main steel kaa utpaadan hi nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki rail patariyaan banaai ja saken
 The fight was on, but the laying of the tracks was halted
 jharkhand main ban rahaa tha fauladi steelain maukey par british sarkaar kii najar gai apane upnivesh bharat par
 In those days, a steel factory was newly started in the dense forests of undivided Bihar (now Jharkhand)
 us vakt is jagah par chotanagpur ke jangalon kii ratnagarbha dharti main chupe kachche lohe ko pighalaakar duniya kaa sarvottam quality kaa fauladi steel banaaya ja rahaa tha
 The factory was owned by Jamshed Ginouserwan Ji Tata and the name of the factory was Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO)
 tata ke sapanom kaa majaakabharat us vakt britain kii colony thi
 Britain on its own terms signed a deal to buy steel from Dorabji Tata, the son of TISCO owner Jamsetji Tata
 ye vahi angrej the jo jamshedji ko is steel plant ke liye license nahin de rahe the, or is sapane ke liye jamshed ji kaa majaak udaate the
 One British official even said that Kitatajitana will produce tons of steel, they will have to eat themselves
 darasal ye gulam bharat kii badahaal audyogic tasviir par gumaan main duube ek angrej kii tippanee thi
 Jamshedji statue located in Jubilee Park (photo-jamshedpur nic) 3 lakh tons of steel, and 2500 KM rail tracks, all the steel produced from this factory started being shipped to Britain
 1914 se 1918 ke bich is kaarkaane se 3 lakh ton steel or lagbhag 2500 kilometre tak kii rail patariyaan supplai kii gayi
 Britain mercilessly used this Kharj wealth of Jharkhand in its military operations
 britain ne purvi africa, mesopotamia, philistin or misr ke dur-daraaj ilaakon main rail patariyaan bichaaye or samrajyavad kaa apana makasad saadhaa
 In January 1919 after Tata's steel war in Palestine was over, Lord Chelmsford, the greatest officer of the British government in India and the then Viceroy, himself came to this steel plant and thanked the company
 sakachi main sthit tata steel ke diarector bangale se company ke adhikariyon ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha tha, "main badi mushkil se isaki kalpana kar saktaa hum ki agar tata company ne hamen mesopotamia, egypt, philistin or purvi africa ke liye steel nahin diya hota to kya hota
 "at the same time, he changed the name of this city from Sakchi to Jamshedpur after the great industrialist of the country, Jamshedji Nauserwan Ji Tata
 aaj se 100 saal pehle purvi bharat kaa prasiddh railway stesan tatanagar kalimati ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Lord Chelmsford named it Tatanagar
 tata kaa 100 se zyada saalon kaa safartata steelki sthapana 1907 main hi chuki thi, lekin pehali baar yahaan se steel kaa utpaadan 16 farvari 1912 ko hua
 At that time, India was the only country in Asia which had its own steel factory
 aaj ke paripekshya main bhale hi ye baat bahut choti lage, lekin tab china or japan ke paas bhi ye rutaba hasil na tha
 Situated on the banks of the Swarnarekha and Kharkai rivers, this city has come a long way in the last 100 years

 Tata Steel in the foundation of Howrah Bridge After the First World War, even in the Second World War, Tata Steel became an honor in the eyes of the British due to its world class quality
 haalanki is baar bhi uski manshaa apane samrajyavaadee or shoshankari nitiyon ke poshan kii thi
 In fact, after long discussion and brainstorming, in 1936, the British government decided to build the World Class Bridge over the Hooghly River in Kolkata
 haalanki pul banane par sahmati 1910 ke dashak main ho chuki thi, lekin pratham vishwa yuddh kii vajah se kaam shuru nahin ho sakaa
 In 1926, it was decided to build a suspension bridge over the Hooghly River
 
 
 
 And the second World War map was drawn up by Messrs
 Randes Palmer and a company official named Triton
 1939 main pul banane kaa order messors cleveland brij and ejineering company ko diya gaya
 But by then the world had once again come to the mouth of war
 yuddh ke manch par dost or dushman badal chuke the or nae aujaaron or hathiyaaron ke saath maanavtaa ke vinaash karne ko taiyaar the
 It was only in 1939 that World War II was declared
 Tata steel main yojit ek kaarykram main nrity karti adivasee yuvatiyaan (photo-pitiai)haavda brij ko eent gaare or lakdi se nahin banaaya janaa tha
 The British government was making this miraculous symbol of civil engineering only with large pieces of steel
 lekin duusare vishwa yuddh ke aagaaj ke saath hi england se jo steel bharat aana tha use europe kii ore bhej diya gaya
 Out of the 26000 tonnes of steel needed, only 3000 steel could reach India
 jamshedpur se pahunchaa 23000 ton steelbritish sarkaar ne ek baar phir se tata steel ko is pul ke steel banane ko kaha
 Tata Steel produced 23000 tonnes of special type of steel, making a brilliant presentation of metal engineering
 tata steel kii in moti- moti deevaaron se haavda brij kii neenv rakhi gai, jo aaj bhi tata ke naam ke mutabik quality ke sarvottam pratik hai

 iske baad ve jaan, julmi, badshaah, international khilaadi jaisi kai filmon main najar ai thim
 However, Twinkle was not inclined towards acting and after a few years he left the profession

 desh main bone waalon ne lav jehad kaa jo zehar boyaa wo ab sholon kii shakl main saamne aa rahaa he
 In Rajsamand, Rajasthan, a man was first killed in the name of love jihad, then bitten and then burnt alive
 had to ye he ki iske baad kaatil chhupataa nahin he
 Rather, the video of the entire incident is put on social media and that too with hate speech
 ye video baqayada katl karte vakt wo apane saathi se live ricard karvaa rahaa tha
 When the viral video opened the eyes of the police who smiled the case, now the police are searching for the truth of that killer with bloated hands and feet
 lav main ghola jehadjo video viral hua usamen ek ek darinda ek begunaah shaks ko berahami ke saath maar rahaa he, kaat rahaa he use jinda jala rahaa he
 That place is not the whole of India, it cannot be
 wo tasviren hindustan kii tasviir bhi nahin he, ho bhi nahin sakati
 But the scream of that death is definitely for India
 bas yun samaj lijie ki hindustan cheekh rahaa he
 The burning death of all those who dissolved jihad in love and gave it the name of love jihad and then made the same love a part of politics with hate
 kaatil to bas unheen kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 The murderer made the video of the incident after killing in the video, 'jihadis it will be your condition, spread love jihad in our country
 har jihadiyon kii haalat aisi hogi
 End the jihad baaki ye haalat hogi har jihadi kii
 'the killer is seen saying clearly in the viral video' Jihadis move away from our country
 ye tumhaara anjaam hoga
 Remove Jihad from all over India
 nahin to ek-ek ko chun ke har bhartiya khadaa hokar
 Will kill like this
 ye dekh lo tumhaara anjaam
 'you know the dreadful slaughter story in the name of Love Jihad, before you tell me that the person who was killed and burnt is named Mohammed Bhatta Sheikh
 or berahami se uskaa katl karne vaale laal rang kii kameez pahanen jo maar rahaa he or jala rahaa he wo shambhunath raigar he
 The poor did all this only in the name of Love Jihad
 insaaniyat kaa katlashaadi main saazish koi nai baat nahin, naa hi koi nayaa jurm
 There was bloodshed about deception, greed and even marriage in the same gotra or fraternity
 katl hue
 Slaughter became common
 honor kiling hui
 But as soon as the love jihad pair was started to be given to weddings, both love and politics changed
 aisa nahin he ki lav jehad bilkul jhootha he
 Some hardcore and misguided youth must have done so
 magar har lav ko jehad ke chashme se dekh kar yun jinda chita jala dena koun si insaaniyat he?rajsamand kii vaardaatkatl kii ye dahala dene vaali tasviren udaipur se sate rajsamand jile se ai hai
 There is no one else to reveal these pictures, but the killer Darinda Shambhunath Rager himself
 isane katl ke baad baqayada ye tasviren soshal media par daal deen
 Murder plot: The murder was carried out with complete planning
 jis vakt ye sab kuch tab maukey par teen log the
 One is Sheikh, the other is Shambhunath and the third one who is not himself on camera as he is making a video of this incident
 marane se pehle poocha- meraa kasoor kya haivyral video bataati he ki shaikh ek sunsaan jagah par aage-aage chal rahaa tha
 Then suddenly Shambhunath Dhardar from behind suddenly attacks Sheikh with the weapon
 shaikh ladkadhaata hua girane lagata he
 But then he manages and tries to run away
 par kaamyaab nahin ho paata or vahiin zamin par gir padataa he
 And asks Shambhu to ask what his cousin is
 wo use kyon maar rahaa he?maaraa, kaata or petrol daalkar jalayaalekin shanbhu ke sir par khun savaar tha
 He threatens the love jihadis and returns to Sheikh again, now he attacks the Sheikh lying on the ground one after another
 iske baad aakhir main petrol daal kar wo jakhmi shaikh ko aag ke hawaale kar detaa he
 This incident took place near the police station, where the police station of Rajnagar police station was not far from there
 magar police ko isaki koi khabar nahin lagati
 Whenever the news is received in any way, then the police somehow starts to crack the case
 maamla dab bhi jaataa
 But the murderer then put the video on social media himself and it went viral
 tab kahin jaakar police ke haath-paanv foole or use apana ferj yaad aayaa
 Killing Shambhu posted another video on social media before his arrest in Burning Insaniyatabad
 jisamen wo sarender karne kii baat kahata he
 Now the police is going through the history of Shambhu
 partiyon yaa sanghathanon se uske rishte tatol rahi he
 Do not know what she will do next? But a lot was burnt in these flames

 But today his party men are snatching our land at gunpoint and they are sitting silently

 Prior to independence, the royalty had taken the initiative to provide basic infrastructure for the tourists
 1950 ke dashak ke baad mashhoor rambagh pales, phir udaipur kaa lake pales or lakshmi nivas pales shuru hue
 Since 1970, tourists in Jodhpur have enjoyed hosting Ajit Bhavan as a first venture
 usase pehle sailaaniyon ke liye railway atithi grih hi hote the
 Bissau House, Khetri House, Hind Kesari, etc
 were some other places of stay in Jaipur
 isse pradesh main hotalon ke ubhaar ke maukey paidaa hue
 Rajasthan Tours, led by Bhim Singh, came into existence by 1960 and provided the tourists with accommodation and travel facilities
 rajasthan main hotalon ke vikaas ko mote taur par 1970 ke pehle or baad ke daur main baanta ja saktaa he
 The Klamsr group debuted first
 use 1972 main ek samooh ne clamsr amer hotel kaa kaam saunpa
 Shortly thereafter, the Taj group took responsibility of running Rambagh Palace in Jaipur and then Lake Palace
 itisi hotels ne 1980 main jaipur ke nae hotel maan singh ke saath samjhaute par dastakhat kiye or uske baad nitant bhavy ummed bhawan pales ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa sambhala
 Oberoi was first assigned to the Trident Hotel and then to Vilas
 paryaton vibhaag ne 1960 se kaam karnaa shuru kiya
 According to the statistics of the Department of Tourism, 17 lakh foreign tourists came to India in 1990, which increased to 68 lakh by 2013
 uske baad yah ginati 70 lakh paar kar gai
 Of these, 20 to 28 percent came to Rajasthan every year and stayed here for an average of 2 nights

 The state government enacted policies that encouraged operators to establish hotels or for alliances
 bheed ke sijan main jaisalmer or pushkar sareekhee jagahon par royal tent lagaae gaye
 During 1985-86, the then Chief Minister of Rajasthan recognized the need for necessary policy for heritage hotels
 rajgharaanon kii ek parishad banaai gai
 This cleared the way for forts, palaces and havelis to be used as hotels
 isse na keval parisampattiyon se rajasav kamaane kii shuruyaat hui, balki sthaneey logon ke liye rojgaar bhi paidaa hue
 Today, more than 160 heritage buildings are being used as hotels in the state
 varsh 2000 ke baad yahaan ke shaharon ne antarrashtriya hotel brands ko lubhaaya he
 They either came forward to establish a joint venture or entered into management agreements

 Rajasthan offers tourists the unique experience of heritage hotels
 magar in heritage hotalon ko bhi vikaas, jirnaddhar or prabandhan ke liye sahare kii jarurat he
 At least 2,000 to 2,500 rooms of the past will be revived
 pradesh main garmiyon man jahaan mahaj 35 fisadi kamare hi bhar pate hai, vahiin sardiyon ke sijan ke dinon main 80 fisadi tak kamare book ho jate hai or kiraaya bhi 40 se 50 fisadi upar chalaa jaataa he
 a strong domestic marketing policy can fill this gap to a large extent in favor of history and old memories

 pakistan ke saath rishton ko 'sadabahaar' bataanaa beijing ke ucchadhikariyon ko khaasaa pasand he
 But in recent weeks, the forecast of good weather has changed with the arrival of storms, which are usually rare
 islamabad main chini duutavas ne 8 disambar ko ek saarvajanik chetavanee jari kii
 It said "terrorists are planning a series of attacks targeting Chinese organizations and people in Pakistan
" '' is chetavanee ko chini media main bhi khub jagah mili
 Experts in Shanghai had to say that these attacks could jeopardize Chinese investment in Pakistan
 beijing ke do asian kootneetikon ke mutabik, iskaa ek pahalu yah bhi he ki 46 arab dollar ke china-pakistan aarthik galiyare (sipiisi) ke tahat chal rahi pariyojnaon kii hifaazat or duusare intjaamon ko lekar china kii bechaini bad rahi he
 a network of roads and power projects are being erected in this corridor, which runs from Kashmir to Gwadar port in the Arabian Sea and also passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir
 may main queta main do chini naujavaanon ko agava karke unki hatya kar di gai thi
 Pakistan accused him of illegal sermon for South Korean missionaries
 lekin chini media main isaki kuch khaas kawarej nahin hui thi
 Of major concern for Beijing are the differences that have arisen over many of cpec's projects
 sabase pehle pakistan ne sipiisi kii ek yojana baithak se kuch din pehle beijing ko pareshaan karte hue elaan kiya ki usne 14 arab dollar kii diamer bhashaa panbizli pariyojna ko uske hiton ke khilaaf jane vaali china kii 'sakht' vittiya sharton kii vajah se waapas le lee he
 Then Pakistan's newspaper Dawn published the news that a Chinese company has almost stopped the work of the $ 2 billion lahore-matyari transmission line due to 'differences with the government' over creating revolving funds
 akhbaar ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki november kii yojana baithak main beijing ne bataa diya he ki bhrashtachar ko lekar paidaa hui chintaaon kii vajah se teen badi sadak pariyojnaon main bhi paisa lagaana band kar diya jayega
 However, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on December 11, "we appreciate that Pakistan is giving importance to both the project and the security of Chinese citizens
" ''beijing ke kuch adhyetaon kii raay yah he ki sipiisi kaa lambey vakt ke liye vyaavhaarik hona tab tak pasopesh main hi rahegaa jab tak ise van belt van road (obioar) pariyojna ke tahat duusari kshetreey pariyojnaon ke saath nahin joda jaataa
 Some officials say this will also require bringing India along, which is the region's largest market, but is opposed to OBOR as it violates India's sovereignty in the most important corridor POK
 dilachasp baat yah he ki bharat main china ke rajdoot luo jhanohui ne pichley maheene apni us peshkash ko phir jinda kiya jisamen bharat kii chintaaon ko sweekaarte hue sipiisi kaa naam badalane kii baat kahi gai thi
 However, this was not confirmed by the Chinese Ministry
 bhartiya adhikari maanate hai ki pakistani samvedansheeltaa ke aage china ke samarpan ko dekhte hue china ke sipiisi kaa naam badalane yaa jaisaa ki luo ne kaha, jammu or kashmir ke liye ek vaikalpik galiyara banane kii sambhaavna bahut kam he
 However, it is still not clear whether there will be any change in this equation due to stormy clouds over the 'evergreen' relationship

 In the session, Richa said that women are batting in Bollywood today
 logon ko ab bharosa ho rahaa he ki auraten bhi box offis par kama kar de sakati hai
 Can cinema be imagined without women? If not, why is cinema considered male dominated? That too when 'mother India', 'umrao Jaan', 'aandhi', 'bhumika', 'earth', 'mirch Masala', 'damini', 'chandni Bar', 'kamala', 'no One Killed Jessica' , 'the Dirty Picture', 'saat Khoon Maaf' and Kahaani's full of successful female lead films
 kya bina mahila kathankon or mahila kalakaaron ke mughal-e-ajam, anaarakali, dil vaale dulhaniyaan le jaaenge, maine pyaar kiya, kabhi khushi kabhi gam jaisi filmein bhi ban sakati thim
 If not, then what is the reason that from the payment of hero and heroine, women actors do not get as many opportunities as available to men

 On the character of Vicky Donor, Annu Kapoor said that from the beginning of his career he kept getting characters that were not given to mainstream artists because Rohal was very complicated
 annu ne kaha ki bollywood main sahaj or adhik puraskaar kaa kirdaar nae or smart ladakon ko diya jaataa he or jab kirdaar kathin chunauti bharaa hota he tab unke jaise kalakaaron ko mauka miltaa he

 Queen Victoria of Britain was born on 24 May 1819 to this day
 vah britain kii rani thim
 Queen Victoria remained Britain's longest queen, but now Elizabeth II holds the record for being queen for even longer
 aaie jaanate hai rani victoria ke bare main
 
 rani raaj parivaar se taalluk rakhti thim
 In this case, he was raised very strictly
 victoria ke janm ke 8 maheene baad hi pita kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 After which his maternal uncle got his education done
 mana jaataa he ki victoria ko kisi bhi purush se ekant yani akele main milane nahin diya jaataa tha
 Even older servants could not come to them
 jitani der ve shikshakon se padhatin, unki maa yaa daima unke paas baithi rahati
 But in spite of such strictness, at the end of the 19th century, a reality was revealed to the world, which an ordinary British citizen was not ready to digest
 jaane kya thi baatcharon taraf charchaa fail gai thi ki rani kaa pyaar ho gaya he
 People thought that if she is the queen of Britain, then she must have fallen in love with a prince
 lekin jab baat logon ke saamne ai to sabhi ke hosh ud gaye
 The first Queen of Britain, Victoria, did not fall in love with a king but a modest servant
 jo bhartiya tha
 It was Abdul Karim, a slim man who made Queen Victoria her lover
 jab britain ke shahi parivaar ko dahej main mili thi mumbaijane kaise shuru hui prem kahaniabdul kareem 24 saal ke the jab ve 1887 main agra se england gaye the
 He was sent to Queen Victoria as a gift from India
 vah ek saal ke bheetar hi is noujvaan ko maharani ke darbar main shikshak kaa darja de diya gaya tha or unhen nirdesh diya gaya ki wo maharani ko hindi or urdu sikhaaen
 Abdul and Victoria's love affair was revealed when Abdul's diary was revealed
 jisase pataa chalaa ki bharat se maharani kaa sevak banaakar britain gaye abdul kareem ko kis tarah maharani dil de baithi hai
 The story of Victoria and Abdul is exactly like it happens in films
 ek amir gharaane kii ladki or garib ladke ke bich pyaar hona
 Punyathithi: Know why Devendranath says Tagore was very well known for his greatness, let Abdul Karim behave in such a tall stature and beautiful personality that the queen not only impressed him but came closer to him
 baad main abdul kareem ke naam ke aage munshi jud gaya
 He became the Queen's Secretary of India
 jab rani ko abdul se prem hua unki umr 60 varsh thi
 NSA Ajit Dovalmaharani, who changed 'religion' for seven years in PAK, often wrote his heart in letters to him
 kabhi-kabhi to maharani apane patron main chumban ke pratik bhi banaati thi, jo us samay main behad asaadhaaran baat thi
 The relationship between the two was very emotional which can be described at different levels
 maharani kii maut ke baad san 1901 main king edward abdul kareem ko waapas bharat bhej diya
 Not only this, the correspondence between Karim and the Queen was ordered to be confiscated immediately and destroyed
 kareem maharani ke saath kareeb 15 saal rahe
 After his return home, he lived alone in Agra
 agra main unhone jahaan apane aakhri saal bitaye
 When Abdul died in 1909, he was 46 years old

 The CM office stated that Pakistani visa is not required to travel to Kinkankana Sahibaki and the delegation would go there as a pilgrimage to Ardas
 iskapakistanke 9 november ke aayojan se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's statement came after it was recently reported that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has accepted the invitation of Pakistan and may participate in the program of the Vekaratarpur corridor

 All eyes are on the 11 assembly seats of Uttar Pradesh and the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, because while this election is a battle for supremacy for the BJP, the Samajwadi Party is concerned about saving its credibility
 mainpuri seat sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav ne khaali kii he or yahaan se unke bhai ke pote chunaav lard rahe hai
 After the NDA coalition got less seats from the RJD, JDU and the Grand Alliance of the Congress in the by-elections in 10 seats of Bihar Legislative Assembly, there is a perception that the popularity of BJP and especially PM Modi has declined
 aise main bijepi in siton par jeet darj kar ek baar phir se apana varchasv kaayam karnaa chaahegi
 At the same time, after the very poor performance in the Lok Sabha elections, it is considered a fight for the Samajwadi Party to save its existence
 jin teen loksabhaa siton par upachunaav ke liye matdaan ho rahaa he, ve hai - vadodara, mainpuri or madak
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left Vadodara seat

 gujarat kii nai mukhyamantri anandi ben patel ke liye ye up chunaav raajnneeti main unki pehali agnipariksha sabit hogi
 By-elections are being held after the resignations of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mlas in Gujarat's Deesa, Maninagar, Tankara, Khambhaliya, Mangrol, Talaja, Anand, Matar and Linkheda (scheduled Tribes reserved) seats, which won the Lok Sabha elections

 raashtrapati chunaav main vipakshi partiyon ne purv loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar ko chunavi akhaade main utarkar chunaav ko ise rochak bana diya he
 Meira Kumar is pitted against the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate and former Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind at the Center
 donon ummidavaar dalit samudaay se hai or donon kaa sambandh bihar se he
 Explain that Bihar is the birthplace of Meera Kumar, so for Kovind this state is his karmasthali
 aise main is chunaav main jeet kisi bhi ummidavaar kii ho, jeet bihar kii hi hogi
 The meeting of 17 opposition parties under the leadership of Congress President Sonia Gandhi decided to make Meira Kumar the presidential candidate to face Ram Nath Kovind of NDA
 iske baad yah tay hua ki is chunaav main mukhya muqabla do dalit chehron ke bich he
 While Kovind has been the Governor of Bihar, Meera is the daughter of this state
 vaise, is chunaav main in donon ummidavaaron ko lekar bhale hi kai samanthaayen hon, lekin bihar main sattarudh mahagathbandhan main ummidavaar ke samarthan ko lekar foot dikhaai de rahi he
 Janata Dal (united) President and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has announced his support to NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind in the presidential election
 vahiin mahagathbandhan main shaamil congress or rajd mira kumaar ke saath hai
 Politician Surendra Kishore says that Lalu Prasad has no choice but to go with the opposition
 unhone kaha ki bhale hi lalu nitish se apane faisle par punarvichaar karne kaa dabaav daal rahe hon, lekin nitish kii pahchaan nirnay nahin badalane vaale netaa kii rahi he
 He says that if we consider the strength of numbers, he is with Kovind
 aise main vipaksh ne keval is chunaav main apni upasthiti darj karaane ke liye chunavi maidan main apana ummidavaar utaara he
 He claims that this decision will not cause any problem to the grand alliance government in the state
 saath hi unhone kaha ki ,"nitish ke mukhyamantri bane rahane ke liye jahaan rajd ke saath bane rahanaa jahaan jadyu kii majaburi he
 At the same time, Lalu is compelled to support Nitish Kumar to keep his sons in the ministerial post
 ye alag baat he ki nitish rajg ke saath ja sakate hai, lekin lalu ke liye sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan (samprag) main bane rahane ke alaava koi or upaay nahin he
 Here, JDU has made it clear that he is with Kovind in the presidential election, denying Lalu's appeal to reconsider
 bataa den ki kovind kaa taalluk rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) se rahaa he
 The RSS is the guiding organization of the BJP
 isaki vichaardhaara ko congress sahit anya dharmanirpeksh partiyaan rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke liye jimmedaar maanati hai
 By the way, the electoral equations have changed after Nitish's decision
 isamen bhi bihar kii bhoomika ahm ho gai he
 By the way, Lalu Prasad is exerting pressure on Nitish by describing Meera Kumar as 'bihar's daughter'
 patna ke varisht patrkaar kaa kahana hai ki is chunaav main mukhya muqabla kovind or mira ke bich he
 He said, "even though Lalu is pressuring Meera by describing Meera as 'bihar's daughter', the same will apply to Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party for Uttar Pradesh's 'lal' Kovind
 unhone aage kaha, "yah chunaav spasht rup se do vichaardhaaraon kii ladaai he, jisamen aankade kovind ke paksh main hai
 Well, whoever wins in this election, but it is certain that the way to go to Rashtrapati Bhavan in this election will pass through Bihar itself
 uttar pradesh ke CM yogi adityanath kii police jis tarah tabadatod badmaashon ke encounter main lagi he, usase badmaashon main police kaa khauf saaf najar aane laga he
 The miscreants are in such a bad condition that they do not want to come out of jail due to fear of encounter
 bel milane ke baavjood ye badmaash jail main hi pade hue hai or kitne hi badmaashon ne to police ko shapathpatr tak de diya he ki ab ve koi aparaadh nahin karenge
 The latest example comes from Kairana, where many notorious criminals have applied to remain inside the prison
 gauratlab he ki shamali main badmaashon par upi police kaa kahar kuch zyada hi barapa he
 In the 10 months of Yogiraj, UP Police has killed 6 notorious criminals in Shamli alone, while 80 miscreants have been arrested
 badmaashon main police or encounter kaa khauf is kadar failaa hua he ki kai badmaash to apni jamaanat radd karvaa waapas jail chale gaye hai
