 Madhav said, "we disagree with Singh's various conclusions, and especially his conclusions regarding Muslims in India
" unhone kaha ki muslim yahaan khud ko alag-thalag mahasoos karte hai

 The BJP also distanced itself from Singh's statement on Patel
 bijepi ke ek saansad ne kaha, ‘‘ham patel ke bare main pustak main singh kii ore se vyakt kii gai raay se sahamat nahin hai
 The BJP has always praised Patel for the integration of the provinces

 input: bhashaa The Shiv Sena BJP, adamant on the formula of 50-50 in Maharashtra, said that a minority government will not form, the term of the term of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly is being completed on November 9
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne tay kiya he ki wo alpamat kii sarkaar nahin banaaegi
 The BJP knows that if it formed a minority government without figures, it would give the Shiv Sena an excuse to openly go with the Nationalist Congress Party (ACP) and the Congress
 maharashtra main sarkaar banane kii kya hai do surat?maharashtra main 24 oktober ko vidhansabha chunaav kaa jo janadesh aayaa, use dekhte hue rajya main do hi surat hai
 1- Shiv Sena and BJP reconcile and form government 2- Shiv Sena should explore other options and form government in alliance with NCP and Congress should support it
 pehali surat ke hakeekat main badalane ke liye jaruri he ki shivasena mukhyamantri pad ke liye apni daavedaari chode or bijepi bhi sena se kiye gaye vaade ke mutabik 50-50 ke formule ko sweekaar kare
 Only after this can we proceed to negotiate in this direction
 9 november ke baad kya kar sakate hai rajyapal?upar di gayi do surat main koi bhi sire nahin chadhati to 9 november ko devendra fadanvis ko istipha dena padegaa or nivartmaan vidhansabha kaa kaarykaal khatm ho jayega
 After this, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari will appoint Fadnavis as the acting Chief Minister
 saath hi sarkaar gathan ke anya vikalpon ko talash kiya jayega
 Among them, the largest party will be called and asked if it is in a position to form the government? Other parties or coalitions will then be called
 ye sab karne ke baad bhi koi hal nahin niklaa to rajyapal apni report saunpenge or maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan kii sifarish karenge
 However, it is unlikely that President's rule is imposed immediately after 9 November
 lekin niyam kehete hai ki jab tak nai sarkaar nahin ban jaati, nai vidhansabha astitv main nahin aa sakati
 Nor can newly elected mlas take oath of membership of the House
 ateet main aise ghatnakram maharashtra main dekhe ja chuke hai
 What happened in 1999? Newly formed NCP
 tab congress or ensipi ne alag alag vidhansabha chunaav ladaa
 At that time, the ruling Shiv sena-bjp alliance was trying to come back to power
 7 oktober 1999 ko nattejey aae
 The Congress emerged as the single largest party with 75 seats
 ensipi ko 58 seat mili
 The Shiv sena-bjp alliance then won 125 seats (shiv Sena 69, BJP 56)
 tatkaaleen rajyapal pisi alexander ne pehle shivasena-bijepi gathbandhan ko bula kar poocha ki kya wo sarkaar banane kii sthiti main he
 This coalition did not have a majority
 udhar congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane ke liye baat shuru ho gai
 On 18 October 1999, Vilasrao Deshmukh of the Congress took oath as Chief Minister after getting support from ACP and some Independent mlas
 us vakt nattejey aane ke baad sarkaar banane main kul 11 din lag gaye
 What happened in 2004? Also in 2004, as in 2019, there were two alliances
 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 16 oktober 2004 ko aae
 Congress and NCP got 140 seats together
 is gathbandhan ko kuch nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa bhi samarthan hasil tha
 But then a screw surfaced
 wo tha ensipi ko 71 or congress ko 69 seat par jeet hasil hui thi
 In such a situation, the NCP got a chance to stake his claim on the Chief Minister's chair
 ensipi ko zyada seat mili thi or gathbandhan main ye sahmati bhi thi ki jis party ko zyada seat milengi usee kaa mukhyamantri hoga
 Even then the date of dissolution of the outgoing assembly was not reached until October 19, 2004
 tab chunaav nattejey aane ke 16 din baad jaakar ensipi or congress main samjhauta hua
 Vilasrao Deshmukh was sworn in as Chief Minister on 1 November 2004
 lekin ensipi ko teen atirikt cabinet mantri pad dene ke liye congress ko raji hona padaa
 Even in 2004, after the term of the outgoing assembly i
e
 19 October, the next assembly could not be constituted for 13 days
 tatkaaleen rajyapal ne tab intazaar karnaa behatar samajha or congress-ensipi ko apane matbhed sulajhane ke liye vakt mila
 Looking at the electoral history of Maharashtra, after the elections in the state, there came many occasions when the deadlock over the winning coalition emerged and which party got the chief minister's post, it emerged as a big topic of controversy

 Officials of Swadeshi Jagran Manch say that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while deciding to replace NITI Aayog with Planning Commission, had clearly said that this is to increase cooperative federalism
 piem modi ne kaha tha ki niti ayog kii soch upar se neeche ke bajaae neeche se upar kii hogi yani kisi bhi faisale main hissedaaron se vyapak vichaar-vimarsh hoga
 According to the forum this is not happening

 According to Swadeshi Jagran Manch, NITI Aayog formulated a policy on this without consulting the state governments properly
 jabaki ye ek aisa vishay he jis par rajyon kii raay lee jaani chahie thi
 Similarly, NITI Aayog's reports on important subjects like agriculture, employment seem to be prepared without the advice of the states

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi is scheduled to do a road show on August 2 in Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of PM Narendra Modi
 apane is daure ke dauraan wo modi ke vikaas kaaryon ko dekhengi or aagaamee chunaav main use mudda bhi banaaengi
 Congress workers are working to make this tour of Sonia successful
 sonia ke is daure ko lekar kaaryakarta bhi khub utsahit hai
 On the lines of Kyoto, what has been developed in Varanasi, for this, people are going to the public and talking to them
 baba vishwanath ke darshan bhi karengi sonia gandhicongress ke upi upaadhyaksh rajesh mishra kaa kahana he ki sonia gandhi banaras ko apane nazariye se dekhne ke liye aaengi or varanasi ko lekar kya vaade kiye gaye the or kitne puure hue hai, iskaa akalan karengi
 At the same time Congress MLA Ajay Rai says that we had requested Sonia Gandhi, accepting it, she will come here and will also see Baba Vishwanath and Sankat Mochan

 This is the reason why Sonia Gandhi, who defeated the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections, wants to reach Modi's parliamentary constituency and give a message to the public by examining his development promises and claims
 amethi or raibareli kaa 40 saalon kaa hisaab den sonia: bijepibijepi ke sthaneey netaaon kaa kahana he ki sonia ke is daure se unako koi fark nahin padane vaala he
 bjp's Legislative Council member Laxman Acharya said that it is better than assessing Modi's development work that Sonia Gandhi would bring Amethi and Rae Bareli accounts of what they have done there for the last 40 years

 Arvind Kejriwal announced the Chief Minister Street Light Scheme at the Delhi Secretariat on Monday
 is yojana ko 1 november se lagu kiya jayega
 Under this scheme, two lakh ten thousand street lights will be installed in Delhi
 ise lagane kii jimmedaari teenon discom (bijli companiyon) kii hogi
 It will have 20 or 40 watt LED lights
 teen se paanch saal tak street lite ke marammat kii jimmedaari street lite saplir company kii hogi
 Hundred crores will be spent on this scheme
 das karod rupee prati varsh marammat par kharch honge
 The government claims that under this scheme, Delhi's black spot will be eradicated in three months
 mukhyamantri street lite yojana main kharch kaa anumaan 100 karod he or vaarshik rakh-rakhaav laagat 10 karod rupee he
 The government hopes that the scheme will be an effective step to increase the safety of women in Delhi and reduce crime against women
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne kaha ki is yojana ke tahat lite lagavane kii anumati dene kaa adhikaar vidhayak ko hoga
 There will also be marked dark spots
 phir bhawan maalik kii anumati lee jaaegi
 After this, a survey of the electricity company will be done
 survey main sthaan bijli company kii ore se paas hone ke baad street lite laga di jaaegi
 The general public can also contact the MLA and get the street light installed
 street liton ke liye sthaan kaa chayan ek november se pehle kar liya jayega
 The lights will work automatically
 The lights under this scheme will be automatic
 isamen sensor laga hoga
 They will automatically burn when it is dark and will stop when the sun sets in the morning
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar mukhyamantri street lite yojana ke tahat dilli main 2
 Starts installation of 1 lakh street lights
 prayek discom 70,000 street lite lagaayengi
 The plan will include 20 / 40 w LED lights with timers and sensors
 ye roshni surya ke prakaash ko mahasoos karegi or swachaalit rup se prakaash karegi
 In the tender, we will provide only light with a warranty of at least 3 to 5 years
 makaan maalik ke ghar se milegi bijlistreet lite ko makaan maalik ke ghar se hi bijli milegi
 In a day or two, it will be decided how much electricity will be spent on one light
 phir utani unit bijli ko makaan maalik ke bill se kam kar diya jayega
 This will also be an automatic arrangement
 mukhyamantri ne kaha jis tarah se logon ne apane ghar par sisitivi lagane kii anumati di thi or jis utsaah se log sisitivi skim main jude hai, hamen ummid he utani hi ruchi janata kii mukhyamantri streetlite yojana main bhi hogi
 There was trouble in getting permission
 The Delhi government wanted to install street lights all over Delhi, but there is a shortage of space in raw colonies and slums
 phir kai jagah emsidi se anumati kii aadchan thi
 There is a provision in Delhi that permission from MCD is necessary to install street lights along the way
 dilli sarkaar tamaam yojanaon ke tahat street lite lagane kaa prayaas pichley do saal se kar rahi thi
 But she was constantly failing due to not getting permission from MCD
 is kaaran is yojana ko laanch kiya gaya
 Only the permission of the MLA and the landlord is required
 log apane ghar, dukaan, gali, kahin bhi ise lagava sakate hai
 Crime will be helped to stop crime in Delhi with women in dark places
 ise khatm karne main yah yojana kargar he
 Chief Minister Kejriwal said that CCTV was installed first
 ab lite lag jaaengi
 This will help in reducing crime against women

 bijepi ko lagata he ki modi ke khilaaf musalmaan voton kaa jitna zyada dhruvikaran hoga, modi ke paksh main mandal voton kaa dhruvikaran bhi utana hi zyada hoga
 That means Mandal vote will come in bjp's court from rjd's court

 The attack occurred when the mosque was filled with devotees
 british media ke mutabik hamalavar british mul kaa 28 varshiya yuvak brenton tarrent he jo australia kaa rahane vaala he

 By definition it is a terrorist attack

 Because Turkey is foreign and basically an enemy of Europe
 iske alaava wo france ke udaaravaadi raashtrapati ko antarrashtriyatavaadi, vaishvik or shwet virdohi bataata he
 The attacker states that the events affecting his mind are terrorist attacks in European countries

 Ananya Pandey's film Student of the Year was released in June this year
 is film ke turant baad ve ek vivaad main funs gai thim
 In fact, during the promotions of her debut film, Ananya had made it clear that she was offered admission in a University of California but she refused to study there due to her acting career
 ananyaa kii ye baat sunakar unki ek tathakthith classmet ne daawa kiya tha ki ananyaa kii admician kii baat jhooth he or is dost ne personal messages ke screenshots soshal media par share karte hue ananyaa ko expoj karne kii baat kahi thi
 However, Ananya also said on Instagram that she could not attend this college as her film career progressed and that she was so upset with the rumors that she had submitted certificates and documents related to her California college Was also shared on social media
 ananyaa darasal is negitivity se kaaphi samay tak pareshaan raheen lekin aakhirkaar unhone apane sartifikates instagram par share kiye the
 View this post on instagrami didn't want to do this
 i didn’t feel like i needed to explain myself to anyone, but the rumours that i faked my admission at USC have been doing the rounds for a while now
 They've been getting out of hand, and it's even more unfair and sad that my family and friends have to go through this
 As I've stated earlier, i was accepted by Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at USC for a major in Communication in the Spring 2018 semester
 But since i was shooting for my first film and the release date later got pushed, i had to request for a deferral (which means postponing my admission) twice - first to Fall 2018 and later to Fall 2019, both of which they gracefully agreed to do
 In my case, i could only defer my admission two times so i will not be attending university (for now), since I’ve decided to pursue my career in acting
 As for the people who have been trying to pull me down with these accusations, i would like to send you all lots of love, peace and positivity
 And would also like to say that even though they’re claiming to be my classmates (nameless and faceless) - I'm sure they aren’t because I’ve grown up with the people i went to school with and they would never do something like that
 It's never okay to bully anyone - creating fake conversations, stories and screenshots is very dangerous and can seriously damage people's lives
 So please be loving, positive and kind
 PS (PS - my father's real name is Suyash and i blurred out my address for security reasons) a post shared byananya 💛💫 (@ananyapanday) onjun 8, 2019 at 2:36 am PDT Ananya's father Chunky Pandey while talking about the matter It was said that when she had a college incident with her, she had worked with great courage but she was quite shaken from inside
 uski haalat ko dekhakar hi maine use kaha tha ki use is maamle main chup nahin baithna chahie
 She remained calm in this matter for a long time but i told her that she has a chance that she can answer people who are slinging mud on her

 5 years ago in 2014, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court demanding the abolition of Article 35-A
 tab se ye maamla desh main bahes or kashmir main virodh kaa centre bana hua he
 In such a situation it becomes necessary to understand what is Article 35-A of the Constitution related to Kashmir and why it is being described as the root of separatism in Kashmir
 is maamle par supreme court kii constitution bench ko faisla lenaa he
 Article 35-A was added to the constitution in 1954, 7 years after independence

 raashtrapati ke aadesh se samvidhan main judaa ye anuchhedrashtrapati kaa ye aadesh samvidhan ke anuchhed 370 (1) (d)ke tahat jari kiya gaya tha
 This provision empowers the President to make changes and exemptions on the subject of the state in the case of Jammu and Kashmir as and when required in the Constitution
 anuchhed 35-A se judi khaat baat ye he ki ise banaate samay sansadeey pranali se kanoon banane kii prakriya kii jagah raashtrapati ke aadesh ke jariye ise samvidhan main joda gaya
 Whereas Article 368 (i) of the Constitution gives the right to any amendment to the Constitution only to the Parliament

 However, the court's decision did not elicit an answer then

 is yachika main tark diya gaya he ki aazaadee ke baad desh kaa samvidhan banane ke liye jo samvidhan sabha bani thi usamen jammu-kashmir ke 4 pratinidhi bhi shaamil the
 Also, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was never given special status

 This article prevents the people of the rest of the states from getting jobs in Jammu and Kashmir, buying property which is a violation of the fundamental rights given in the Constitution

 is kanoon ke praavdhaanon ko kashmir main algaavvaad ko badhaava dene vaala bataate hue khaarij karne kii maang kii gai
 What are the provisions in Article 35-A: - Article 35-A sets the rules of permanent citizenship for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and the rights of citizens - The Government of Jammu and Kashmir considers those who are permanent residents in Kashmir before 14 May 1954 They were settled - such permanent residents have got rights to buy land in the state, get employment and benefit in government schemes

 Subject: Investigation of rape of hundreds of girls by the Maharaja of Dera
 shriman ji, yah he ki main punjab kii rahane vaali hum or ab paanch saal se deraa sachcha sauda sirsa, haryana (dhan-dhan satguru tera hi aasraa) main sadhu ladki ke rup main seva kar rahi hum
 Along with me, hundreds of girls also serve 18-18 hours in the camp
 hamaara yahaan shaareerik shoshan kiya ja rahaa he
 Simultaneously vaginal exploitation (rape) is being done by Maharaja Gurmeet Singh of Dera
 main bie paas ladki hum
 Members of my family are blind devotees of Maharaj, by whose inspiration i became a monk in the camp
 sadhu banane ke do saal baad ek din maharaj gurmeet kii param shishyaa sadhu gurujot ne raat ke 10 baje muno bataaya ki aapako pita ji ne gupha (maharaj ke rahane kaa sthaan) main bulaayaa he
 i was very happy because i was going for the first time
 yah jaanakar ki aaj khud paramatma ne muno bulaayaa he
 While going upstairs in the cave, i saw Maharaj sitting on the bed
 haath main remote he, saamne tivi par blue film chal rahi he
 Revolver is placed on the bed towards the head
 main yah sab dekhakar hairaan rah gai
 i started feeling dizzy
 mere paanv ke neeche kii jameen khisak gai
 What is this happening
 maharaj aise honge? aisa maine sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Maharaj switched off the TV and sat with me and gave him water and said that i have called you as my special beloved
 meraa yah pehla din tha
 Maharaj took me in the arms and said that we want you with my heart
 tumhaare saath pyaar karnaa chaahate hai, kyonki tumne hamaare saath sadhu banate vakt tan-man-dhan sab satguru ke arpan karne ko kaha tha
 So now this body and mind is ours
 mere virodh karne par unhone kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ham hi khuda hai
 When i asked if it was the work of God, he said - Shri Krishna was God, he had 360 gopis with whom he used to love every day
 phir bhi log unhen paramatma maanate hai, yah koi nai baat nahin he
 If we wish, you can cremate your life with this revolver
 tumhaare gharavaale is prakaar se hamaare par vishwaas karte hai va hamaare gulam hai
 They cannot go beyond us
 yah tumko achche se pataa he
 There is a lot going on in our government
 haryana va punjab ke mukhyamantri, punjab ke kendriya mantri hamaare charan choote hai
 Politicians take support from us, take money and will never go against us
 ham tumhaare parivaar ke naukari lage sadasyon ko barkhaast karvaa denge
 Will get all the members killed by their servants (goodies)
 saboot bhi nahin chodenge
 It is well known that even before the goons, we had eliminated the manager of the camp, Fakir Chand, who does not even know
 naa hi koi saboot bakaayaa he
 With the help of money, we will buy political and police and justice
 1is tarah mere saath munh kaala kiya or pichley teen maas main 20-30 din baad kiya ja rahaa he
 Today i came to know that the girls who lived before me have been blackened with all of them
 dere main maujuud 35-40 sadhu ladki 35-40 varsh kii umr se adhik hai jo shaadi kii umr se nikal chuki hai
 Who have compromised the circumstances
 inamen zyaadaatar ladkiyaan bie, eme, bied, emphil paas hai, magar gharavaalon ke andhvishwasi hone ke kaaran narak kaa jivan ji rahi hai
 We have to wear white clothes, sardine on the head, do not look at any man with eyes, stay 5-10 feet away from the man, is Maharaj's command but goddess to show but our condition is like prostitutes
 maine ek baar apane parivaaravaalon ko bataaya ki dere main sabakuch thik nahin he to mere ghar vaale gusse main hote hue kehane lage ki agar bhagwaan ke paas rahete hue thik nahin he to thik kahaan he
 Bad thoughts have started coming in your mind
 satguru kaa simaran kiya kar
 i am helpless
 yahaan satguru kaa aadesh maananaa padataa he
 Here no two girls can talk among themselves
 gharavaalon ko telephone milakar baat nahin kar saktin
 When the family members get a call in our name, we are not ordered to talk to the Maharaja
 yadi koi ladki dere kii is sachai ke bare main baat karti he to maharaj kaa hukum he ki uskaa munh band kar do
 Recently, when the girl Sadhu of Bathinda revealed the black handiwork of Maharaj to all the girls, several sadhus girls beat her together
 jo aaj bhi ghar par is maar ke kaaran bistar par padi he
 Whose father has quietly seized the house after cutting names from servants
 jo chaahate hue bhi badanaami or maharaj ke dar se kisi ko kuch nahin bataa rahi
 a sadhu girl from Kurukshetra district who has come home has told the truth to her family members
 uskaa bhai bada sevadaar tha, jo ki seva chhodkar dere se naata tod chukaa he
 When a girl from Sangrur district came home and told the neighbors about the black acts of the dera, the servants / goons of the dera came to the house of a girl armed with guns
 ghar ke andar se kundi lagaakar jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di va bhavishya main kisi se kuch bhi nahin bataane ko kaha
 Similarly, many girls are from district Mansa (punjab), Ferozepur, Patiala, Ludhiana
 jo ghar jaakar bhi chup hai kyonki unhen jaan kaa khatra he
 Similarly, many girls of district Sirsa, Hisar, Fatehabad, Hanuman Garh, Meerut, who are not saying anything in front of the hooliganism of the dera
 at: aapse anurodh he ki in sab ladakiyon ke saath-saath muno bhi mere parivaar ke saath jaan se maar diya jayega agar main isamen apana naam-pataa likhuungi
 Because i cannot shut up nor do i want to die
 janata ke saamne sachai laana chaahati hum
 If you get any agency investigated through the press, then there are 40-45 girls in the camp who are in fear and fear
 puraa vishwaas dilaane ke baad sachai bataane ko taiyaar hai
 Our doctor should be inspected so that our parents and you will know whether we are sadhus or not
 agar nahin to kisi ke dwaara barbaad hui hai
 It will tell you that Maharaj Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh ji has been destroyed by Sant Dera Sacha Sauda
 shriman ji, yah he ki main punjab kii rahane vaali hum or ab paanch saal se deraa sachcha sauda sirsa, haryana (dhan-dhan satguru tera hi aasraa) main sadhu ladki ke rup main seva kar rahi hum
 Along with me, hundreds of girls also serve 18-18 hours in the camp
 hamaara yahaan shaareerik shoshan kiya ja rahaa he
 Simultaneously vaginal exploitation (rape) is being done by Maharaja Gurmeet Singh of Dera
 main bie paas ladki hum
 Members of my family are blind devotees of Maharaj, by whose inspiration i became a monk in the camp
 sadhu banane ke do saal baad ek din maharaj gurmeet kii param shishyaa sadhu gurujot ne raat ke 10 baje muno bataaya ki aapako pita ji ne gupha (maharaj ke rahane kaa sthaan) main bulaayaa he
 i was very happy because i was going for the first time
 yah jaanakar ki aaj khud paramatma ne muno bulaayaa he
 While going upstairs in the cave, i saw Maharaj sitting on the bed
 haath main remote he, saamne tivi par blue film chal rahi he
 Revolver is placed on the bed towards the head
 main yah sab dekhakar hairaan rah gai
 i started feeling dizzy
 mere paanv ke neeche kii jameen khisak gai
 What is this happening
 maharaj aise honge? aisa maine sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha
 Maharaj switched off the TV and sat with me and gave him water and said that i have called you as my special beloved
 meraa yah pehla din tha
 Maharaj took me in the arms and said that we want you with my heart
 tumhaare saath pyaar karnaa chaahate hai, kyonki tumne hamaare saath sadhu banate vakt tan-man-dhan sab satguru ke arpan karne ko kaha tha
 So now this body and mind is ours
 mere virodh karne par unhone kaha ki isamen koi shaq nahin ham hi khuda hai
 When i asked if it was the work of God, he said - Shri Krishna was God, he had 360 gopis with whom he used to love every day
 phir bhi log unhen paramatma maanate hai, yah koi nai baat nahin he
 If we wish, you can cremate your life with this revolver
 tumhaare gharavaale is prakaar se hamaare par vishwaas karte hai va hamaare gulam hai
 They cannot go beyond us
 yah tumko achche se pataa he
 There is a lot going on in our government
 haryana va punjab ke mukhyamantri, punjab ke kendriya mantri hamaare charan choote hai
 Politicians take support from us, take money and will never go against us
 ham tumhaare parivaar ke naukari lage sadasyon ko barkhaast karvaa denge
 Will get all the members killed by their servants (goodies)
 saboot bhi nahin chodenge
 It is well known that even before the goons, we had eliminated the manager of the camp, Fakir Chand, who does not even know
 naa hi koi saboot bakaayaa he
 With the help of money, we will buy political and police and justice
 1is tarah mere saath munh kaala kiya or pichley teen maas main 20-30 din baad kiya ja rahaa he
 Today i came to know that the girls who lived before me have been blackened with all of them
 dere main maujuud 35-40 sadhu ladki 35-40 varsh kii umr se adhik hai jo shaadi kii umr se nikal chuki hai
 Who have compromised the circumstances
 inamen zyaadaatar ladkiyaan bie, eme, bied, emphil paas hai, magar gharavaalon ke andhvishwasi hone ke kaaran narak kaa jivan ji rahi hai
 We have to wear white clothes, sardine on the head, do not look at any man with eyes, stay 5-10 feet away from the man, is Maharaj's command but goddess to show but our condition is like prostitutes
 maine ek baar apane parivaaravaalon ko bataaya ki dere main sabakuch thik nahin he to mere ghar vaale gusse main hote hue kehane lage ki agar bhagwaan ke paas rahete hue thik nahin he to thik kahaan he
 Bad thoughts have started coming in your mind
 satguru kaa simaran kiya kar
 i am helpless
 yahaan satguru kaa aadesh maananaa padataa he
 Here no two girls can talk among themselves
 gharavaalon ko telephone milakar baat nahin kar saktin
 When the family members get a call in our name, we are not ordered to talk to the Maharaja
 yadi koi ladki dere kii is sachai ke bare main baat karti he to maharaj kaa hukum he ki uskaa munh band kar do
 Recently, when the girl Sadhu of Bathinda revealed the black handiwork of Maharaj to all the girls, several sadhus girls beat her together
 jo aaj bhi ghar par is maar ke kaaran bistar par padi he

 maharaj ne mere ko baahon main lete hue kaha ki ham tuje dil se chaahate hai
 Want to fall in love with you, because you told us to surrender your body, mind and wealth to all Satgurus while becoming a monk with us
 to ab ye tan-man hamaara he
 On opposing me, he said that there is no doubt that we are God
 jab maine poocha ki kya yah khuda kaa kaam he to unhone kaha - shri krishna bhagwaan the, unke yahaan 360 gopiyaan thim jinase vah har roj prem lila karte the
 Still people consider him divine, this is not a new thing
 ham chahen to is revolver se tumhaare praan pakheru udaakar dah sanskaar kar sakate hai
 Your householders believe in us in this way and are our slaves
 vah hamaare se baahar ja nahin sakate
 You know this very well
 hamaari sarkaar main bahut chalati he
 The Chief Ministers of Haryana and Punjab, Union Ministers of Punjab touch our feet
 raajnneetijna hamase samarthan lete hai, paisa lete hai or hamaare khilaaf kabhi nahin jaaenge
 We will get your family members dismissed
 sabhi sadasyon ko apane sevadaaron (gudon) se marava denge
 Will not leave evidence
 yah tumhen acchhee tarah pataa he ki hamane gundon se pehle bhi dere ke prabandhak fakir chand ko khatm karvaa diya tha jinka ata-pataa tak nahin he
 There is no outstanding evidence
 jo ki paise ke bal par ham raajnneetik va police or nyaay ko kharid lenge
 1 In this way, i have blackened my face and is being done after 20-30 days in the last three months
 aaj mujhako pataa chalaa ki mere se pehle jo ladkiyaan rahati thim, un sabake saath munh kaala kiya gaya he
 The 35-40 sage girls present in the dera are over the age of 35-40 who have passed out of marriage
 jinhone paristhitiyon se samjhauta kar liya he
 Most of these girls are BA, MA, b
ed
, m
phil pass, but due to superstitious householders, they are living a hellish life
 hamen safed kapade pahananaa, sir par chunni rakhana, kisi aadmi kii taraf aankh na uthaakar dekhnaa, aadmi se 5-10 foot kii duuri par rahanaa maharaj kaa aadesh he lekin dikhaane main devi hai magar hamaari haalat veshyaaon jaisi he
 i once told my family that everything is not right in the camp, then my family started getting angry and said that if it is not good while staying with God, then where is it? tere man main bure vichaar aane lag gaye hai
 By following the Satguru
 main majaboor hum
 Here Satguru has to obey the order
 yahaan koi bhi do ladkiyaan aapas main baat nahin kar saktin
 The family members cannot talk by mixing the telephone
 gharavaalon kaa hamaare naam phone aae to hamen baat karne kaa maharaj ke aadeshaanusaar hukum nahin he
 If a girl talks about this truth of the dera, then the king is ordered to shut her mouth
 pichley dinon bathinda kii ladki sadhu ne jab maharaj kii kaali karatuuton kaa sabhi ladakiyon ke saamne khulaasa kiya to kai sadhu ladakiyon ne milakar use peeta
 Who is still in bed due to this hit at home
 jiskaa pita ne sevadaaron se naam katwakar chupchaap ghar baitha diya he
 Who, despite wanting, is not telling anyone anything because of slander and fear of Maharaj
 ek kurukshetra jile kii ek sadhu ladki jo ghar aa gai he, usne apane ghar waalon ko sab kuch sach bataa diya he
 His brother was a great servant, who had left the service and broke up with the camp
 sangrur jile kii ek ladki jisane ghar aakar padosiyon ko dere kii kaali karatuuton ke bare main bataaya to dere ke sevadaar / gunde banduukon se las ladki ke ghar aa gaye
 Threatened to kill with a latch from inside the house and asked to not tell anyone anything in future
 isi prakaar kai ladkiyaan jaise ki jila mansa (punjab), ferozepur, patiala, ludhiana kii hai
 Those who go home are silent because they are in danger of life
 isi prakaar jila sirsa, hisar, fatehbaad, hanuman garh, meerut kii kai ladkiyaan jo ki dere kii gundgardee ke aage kuch nahin bol raheen
 Therefore, you are requested that along with all these girls, i will be killed along with my family if i write my name and address in it
 kyonki main chup nahin rah sakati or naa hi maranaa chaahati hum
 i want to bring the truth to the public
 agar aap press ke madhyam se kisi bhi agency se jaanch karavaaen to dere main maujuud 40-45 ladkiyaan jo ki bhay or dar main hai
 After giving full confidence, they are ready to tell the truth
 hamaara doctorl muyna kiya jaae taaki hamaare abhibhavakon va aapako pataa chal jayega ki ham kumari devi sadhu hai yaa nahin
 If not, then they are ruined by anyone
 ye bataa denge ki maharaj gurmeet ram rahim singh ji, sant deraa sachcha sauda ke dwaara tabah kii gai hai
 When i asked if it was the work of God, he said - Shri Krishna was God, he had 360 gopis with whom he used to love every day

 As much as Pakistan tries to promote terror, India will fight it firmly, and now terror will not be tolerated at all, because the Prime Minister has clearly said that the policy of zero tolerance against terrorism will have to be adopted now
 Because terror remains part of the foreign policy of our neighboring country
 dilli ke vigyaan bhawan main mukhyamantriyon ke sammelan main pradhanmantri ne pakistan ko sidhe nishane par liya
 The Prime Minister said that the kind of terrorist attack on Mumbai would not have been possible without the cooperation of Pakistani agency
 pradhanmantri ke mutabik pakistan lagaataar jang kaa unmaad bhadakaane kii koshish kar rahaa he, lekin bharat ek majboot raashtra kii tarah buland khadaa he
 However, the Prime Minister linked the Mumbai attack to an attempt to shake the economy of the country and also suggested that we have to strengthen our internal security and intelligence
 mukhyamantriyon ke is sammelan main pradhanmantri ne bharat main aatankwaad ke liye sidhe taur par pakistan ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 The Prime Minister said that Pakistan has made terrorism its policy
 hamaare saamne kain chunautiyaan hai lekin sabase badi he aatankwaad, vampanthi ugravad or purvottar main ugravad
 Left-wing extremism was born on our land
 aatankwaad ko hamaare pados khaskar pakistan se badhaava mila jisane aatankwaad ko sarkari niti kii tarah istemaal kiya
 The Prime Minister stated without any doubt that the Pakistani terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba was the one to carry out the attack in Mumbai, and the kind of attack by the terrorists was not possible without the support of Pakistani agencies
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaa ghuspaith ke liye duusare raaston kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 The infiltration is taking place from Nepal and Bangladesh, not even stopping the loc in Jammu and Kashmir
 ham jaanate hai ki aatanki samudri raaston kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 We failed to act on intelligence, but we knew the terrorists who came from Karachi on 26 November
 mumbai hamale to pakistani sanghathan lashkare taiyaba ne hi karaae, ab tak kii tafteesh jisamen duusare deshon kii jaanch agenciyaan bhi shaamil hai, usase saaf he ki jis tarah kaa hamalaa aatankiyon ne kiya, unhen kisi pakistani agency kaa samarthan jarur tha
 In the presence of all the Chief Ministers and some Union Ministers, the Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks should be seen as linking the economy with the security of our country
 pradhanmantri ne ye saaf sandesh bhi diya ki aise halaat main aatankwaad ke khilaaf jiro tolerance kii niti akhriyaar kerani hogi
 The Prime Minister said that new techniques are being used in terrorist attacks
 wo zyada logon ko maarna chaahate hai
 Terrorists are using new methods of communication
 internet, wais of internet protocol se unhen madad mil rahi he, jisase unhen pakadana mushkil ho rahaa he
 The attacks are happening with complete planning
 mumbai main videshiyon par hamalon se aatankiyon kii manshaa ye kehane kii thi ki bharat pashchimi logon or nivesh ke liye surakshit nahin he
 We have to fight it firmly
 aise hamale dobaaraa naa ho, iskaa intjaam karnaa he
 We have to take the policy of 'zero tolerance' against terrorism with full commitment
 vigyaan bhawan main apni baat khatm karne se pehle pradhanmantri ne duniya ke liye bhi saaf sandesh diya ki tamaam mulkon ko milakar ye tay karnaa hoga ki aatank ko videsh niti ke taur par istemaal karne waalon ko kaise ise chhodane par majaboor kiya jaae
 However, in the midst of all this, the Prime Minister also believed that somewhere there is scope for improvement in our security and intelligence system, for which a lot has to be done
 pradhanmantri ne tamaam rajya sarkaron se apil bhi kii, ki apane is dharm ko ham puri majbootee se nibhaaen
 Pakistan is trying to create a frenzy of war, but our nation stands strong
 andruni suraksha se nipatate hue bhi hamen aise hi rahanaa he
 Things are full of challenges but not out of our control
 chintaa ho sakati he ki hamaara suraksha tantra or upkaran in chunautiyon se ladane ke liye kaaphi nahin lekin jarurat hamaare khufia or takniki soochnaaon ke tantra ko prabhavi banane kii he
 The focus is on training and equipment of the security forces
 main maanata hum ki hamen bahut kuch karnaa he, rajya or centre sarkarein is rashtriya dharm ko majbootee se nibhaaen

 When the Constitution came into force in 1950, the people who were afraid of that Constitution written in English, the impression of the status of the people who made it must have been such that they thought that the Constitution has been implemented, then it is common to understand and fight it It is not a matter of the bus of the people, would it have happened that people would have avoided going to the court, which was still running in the buildings built by the British rule
 aisa bilkul nahin hua
 Actually Rohit Dey has a book, a peopple's CONSTITUTION THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF LAW IN THE INDIAN REPUBLIC
 yah kitaab is myne main rochak he ki isamen vakeelon or jajon kii katha nahin he, unki vidwata or shakespeare ke kots kii charchaa kam he, un aam logon kii baat he jo samvidhan lagu hone ke kuch hi dinon ke bheetar apane adhikaron kii maang ko lekar court chale gaye
 We know that the constitution came into force in 1950, but very few people know how people adopted that constitution, how they understood their own rights and explained to the state what your limits are
 pashchimi upi ke jalalabad kaa mohammad yaccin supreme court aa gaya kyonki jalalabad kii nagarpalika ne tay kiya tha ki ek hi aadmi ko sabzi bechney kaa license milegaa or wo license kisi hindu ko diya gaya
 Yasin made a case that this is an attack on the right to livelihood of all
 kaise kisi ek ko hi license milegaa or pehle se bech rahe sabziwaalon ko bedakhal kar diya jayega
 Absolute claims cannot be said, but Mohammad Yasin is one of the first batch of those who reached the court for their rights, Yasin won the case

 We look at the Constitution Day from the makers and implementers, but today we will see it from the people who adopt and try it
 wo koun log the jinhone samvidhan lagu hone ke pehle kuch maheenon main apni hi chuni hui sarkaar ko chunauti di
 He was reminding us in the first month that well, we have fought for this government for one and a half years, in this government, the same people we used to run, used to go to jail but the spirit of the Constitution would have been the spirit of the Constitution is
 isse samjhauta nahin karenge
 Thousands of people had reached the court on the question of violation of their rights, it seems that the people of India had never seen the Constitution in their lives
 wo bhi state ke kilaaf mukademe kaafii bad gaye the
 In 1950, more than 600 writ petitions were heard in the Supreme Court
 jabaki uske pehle british fedral court ne 11 saal main maatr 169 keson ko hi suna tha
 The Federal Court of India was formed in 1937, which was run by only three judges
 1962 tak supreme court main suni jane vaali yachikaaon kii sankhya 3,833 ho gai thi
 In these 12 years, only 960 cases were heard in the Supreme Court of America
 america kii sarvocch adaalat kaa itihaas 100 saal se zyaada ho chukaa tha
 The courts were giving instructions to the governments while deciding on the writ petition, due to which there was growing uneasiness within the governments that it is its own people, it is a case against us, not only that ordinary people of India from the state i
e
 government The case started winning
 kya yah sundar or dilachasp nahin he ki samvidhan lagu hone ke kuch hi hafton or maheenon main ise logon ne apana liya or iske liye jeene-marane lage
 Within 15 years of the enactment of the Constitution, two-thirds of the lawsuits had citizens and the government face to face
 40 pratishat se adhik keson main log sarkaar se mukadmaa jeet gaye
 The legitimacy of government-made laws was challenged in 487 out of 3272 decisions and quashed
 duniya main aisi kam hi sarkarein hongi jo janata ke saamne apane banaae kaanoonon kaa bachaav nahin kar sakin
 Don't know how many things are desperate to come out in the record room of the Supreme Court
 in yachikaaon ke zarie jab logon ke kisse baahar aaenge tab samvidhan logon ke bich dikhne lagegaa
 You will also get courage when people climbed the stairs of the court in that period, then why are you hesitating
 aisa karte hue un logon ne adaalaton kaa mukaam ooncha hone kaa mauka diya kyonki agar aisa na hota to court kii raajnneeti vakeelon or sarkaron ke bich gum phir kar rah jaati or adaalat ke zarie bharat ke loktantr kaa vistaar nahin hota
 We know big lawyers but ordinary lawyers have also played a big role in this
 samvidhan lagu hone ke vaqt bharat main vakeelon kii koi kami nahin thi
 When India became independent there were 72,425 lawyers
 aabaadi ke lihaaz se sankhya kam ho sakati he magar duniya main america ke baad sabase adhik vakil bharat main hi the
 When China became independent in 1957, there were only 3000 lawyers
 aisa nahin he ki aaj yah prakriya band ho gai he, log apane adhikaron ko lekar sankochi ho gaye hai
 Rather, the result of the foundation that was there at that time is that even today, there are lawyers who come forward to fight for the rights of the common people and do not allow lack of oxygen to keep beating the Constitution and its soul in its time
 
 tippaniyan Hadiya, a typical Kerala girl, comes to the Supreme Court with her case against the powerful NIA
 vah lav jihad kii bogus avadharana kaa pratikaar karti he, news channelon kii hinsak bhashaa ke baad bhi vah supreme court kii sidhiyon ko chadhati he, baqayada mukadmaa ladati he or jeet jaati he
 Not only against the NIA but also against the verdict of Kerala High Court in which her marriage was invalidated

 aap jaanate hai ki main jab bhi kitaab kaa naam letaa hum, uskaa daam or prakaashak zarur bataata hum
 So the people of India were ready, just waiting for the constitution
 jab aayaa to janata ne use banane waalon se samajha
 Even the heads of the governments of that time were annoyed

 1958 main 17 acre zamin par supreme court kii imaarat bani to banane vaale ke dimag main ye baat rahi hogi ki yah insaaf kii sarvocch or antim sanstha he
 Ganesh Bhikaji Devlalikar was its architect who got the opportunity to be the first Indian head of the Public Works Department
 iske pehle supreme court sansad bhawan kii us imaarat main chalata tha jahaan rajavaadon ke raja baithken kiya karte the
 In the basement of this Supreme Court, there is a record room of its decisions where many records such as copy of rulings, evidence filed with them, copy of petition and its language are found
 jamaane tak is record room tak koi scollar nahin gaya kyonki yahaan jane kii koi aupchaarik vyavastha hi nahin thi, jaise agar janaa ho to aap anumati kisase lenge, yahi saafe nahin tha
 Rohit Dey is the first scholar to get a chance to go to the Supreme Court record room in 2010
 1950 main jab samvidhan lagu hua tab angrezi main likhe gaye us samvidhan se kya log bhaybheet ho gaye the, use banane vaale logon kii haisiyat kii chhap kya aisi rahi hogi ki unhen laga hoga ki samvidhan lagu hua he to ise samajhnaa, ise lekar ladanaa aam logon ke bas kii baat nahin he, kya aisa hua hoga ki log adaalat tak jane se kataraate honge, jo abhi bhi british hukumat kii banaai imaaraton main chal rahi thi
 This did not happen at all
 darasal rohit de kii ek kitaab ai he, a peopple's CONSTITUTION THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF LAW IN THE INDIAN REPUBLIC
 This book is interesting in the sense that it does not contain the narrative of lawyers and judges, its scholarly and Shakespeare's quotes are less discussed, it is about the common people who demand their rights within a few days of the Constitution coming into force
 Went to court
 ham yah to jaanate hai ki 1950 main samvidhan lagu hua magar yah bahut kam log jaanate hai ki logon ne us samvidhan ko kaise apanaaya, use lekar khud ke adhikaron ko kaise samajha or state ko kaise samajha diya ki aapaki hadein kya hai
 Mohammad Yasin of Jalalabad in western UP came to the Supreme Court because the Jalalabad municipality had decided that the same man would get a license to sell vegetables and that license was given to a Hindu
 yaccin ne cese kar diya ki yah sabaki aajeevika ke adhikaar par hamalaa he
 How only one will get the license and the already selling vegetables will be evicted
 ekadam daawey se to nahin kaha ja saktaa magar apane adhikaron ko lekar adaalat pahunchane waalon kaa jo pehla jattha rahaa hoga, usamen se mohammad yaccin bhi ek he, yaccin mukadmaa jeet gaya
 The month of November is also the month of Constitution Day
 ham samvidhan diwas ko ise banane waalon or lagu karne waalon kii nigaah se dekhte hai, magar aaj ham ise apnaane vaale or aazamaane vaale logon kii nigaah se dekhenge
 Who were those people who challenged their own elected government in the first few months after the constitution came into force
 ve pehle hi maheene main yaad dilaa rahe the ki thik he, hamane is sarkaar ke liye dedh sau saal sangharsh kiya he, is sarkaar main vahi log hai jinke peeche ham chalaa karte the, jail jaaya karte the lekin samvidhan kii bhaavana samvidhan kii bhaavana hoti he
 Will not compromise with this hazaron kii sankhya main log apane adhikaron ke hanan ke sawaal ko lekar adaalat pahunch gaye the, yah sankhya dekhakar lagata nahin ki bharat kii janata ne apane jivan main kabhi samvidhan dekha hi nahin tha
 They too had increased the lawsuit against the state
 1950 main supreme court main 600 se adhik rit yachikaaon kii sunwaayee hui thi
 Whereas before that, only 169 cases were heard by the British Federal Court in 11 years
 fedral court of india 1937 main bana tha jo sirf teen jajon se chalata tha
 By 1962, the number of petitions heard in the Supreme Court had increased to 3,833
 inhen 12 saalon main america kii sarvocch adaalat main maatr 960 cese hi sune gaye the
 The history of America's highest court was over 100 years old
 adaalatein rit yachika par faisalaa sunaate hue sarkaron ko nirdesh dene lagi thim jiske kaaran sarkaron ke bheetar bechaini badhane lagi ki ye to apni hi janata he, hamaare hi kilaaf cese karti he, yahi nahin bharat kii vah saadhaaran janata badi sankhya main state yani sarkaar se mukadmaa jeetne lagi
 Isn't it beautiful and interesting that within a few weeks and months of the coming into force of the Constitution, it was adopted by the people and started living and dying for it
 samvidhan lagu hone ke 15 saal ke bheetar do tihaai mukademon main naagarik or sarkaar aamane-saamne ho gaye
 In more than 40 percent of the cases, the people won the case from the government
 3272 faisalon main se 487 main sarkaar ke banaae kaanoonon kii vaidhata ko chunauti mili or radd kar die gaye
 There will be few such governments in the world who could not defend their laws before the public
 supreme court ke record room main na jane kitni baaten baahar aane ko betaab hai
 Through these petitions, when the stories of the people come out, then the Constitution will be visible among the people
 aapako bhi himmat aegi jab us daur main log adaalat kii seedhiyaan chadh gaye to aap kyon hichak rahe hai
 In doing so, they gave an opportunity for the courts to be elevated because if it were not so, the politics of the court would have revolved between lawyers and governments and the democracy of India would not have expanded through the court
 ham bade vakeelon ko jaanate hai magar saadhaaran vakeelon ne bhi isamen badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 There was no shortage of lawyers in India at the time the Constitution was implemented
 jab bharat azaad hua tab 72,425 vakil the
 In terms of population, the number may be less, but India had the largest number of lawyers after America in the world
 1957 main jab china azaad hua tab vahaan maatr 3000 vakil the
 It is not that this process has stopped today, people have become shy about their rights
 balki jo buniyaad us vaqt padi thi usee kaa nateeja he ki aaj bhi aise vakil hai jo aam logon ke adhikaron kii ladaai ke liye aage aa jate hai or apane samay main samvidhan or uski aatma ko dhadkate rahane ke liye oxigen kii kami nahin hone dete hai
 The comments kerala kii ek aam ladki haadia shaktishaalee enie ke kilaaf apana mukadmaa lekar supreme court aa jaati he
 She counteracts the bogus concept of love jihad, despite the violent language of the news channels, she climbs up the stairs of the Supreme Court, fights and wins the case
 sirf enie ke kilaaf hi nahin balki kerala hycourt ke faisale ke kilaaf bhi jisamen uski shaadi ko amaanya kar diya gaya tha

 We know big lawyers but ordinary lawyers have also played a big role in this

 When India became independent there were 72,425 lawyers
 aabaadi ke lihaaz se sankhya kam ho sakati he magar duniya main america ke baad sabase adhik vakil bharat main hi the
 When China became independent in 1957, there were only 3000 lawyers
 aisa nahin he ki aaj yah prakriya band ho gai he, log apane adhikaron ko lekar sankochi ho gaye hai
 Rather, the foundation that was there at that time is the result that even today, there are lawyers who come forward to fight for the rights of common people and do not allow lack of oxygen to keep beating the Constitution and its soul in its time

 samvidhan lagu hone ke 15 saal ke bheetar do tihaai mukademon main naagarik or sarkaar aamane-saamne ho gaye
 In more than 40 percent of the cases, the people won the case from the government
 3272 faisalon main se 487 main sarkaar ke banaae kaanoonon kii vaidhata ko chunauti mili or radd kar die gaye
 There will be few such governments in the world who could not defend their laws before the public
 supreme court ke record room main na jane kitni baaten baahar aane ko betaab hai
 Through these petitions, when the stories of the people come out, then the Constitution will be visible among the people
 aapako bhi himmat aegi jab us daur main log adaalat kii seedhiyaan chadh gaye to aap kyon hichak rahe hai
 In doing so, they gave an opportunity for the courts to be elevated because if it were not so, the politics of the court would have revolved between lawyers and governments and the democracy of India would not have expanded through the court
 ham bade vakeelon ko jaanate hai magar saadhaaran vakeelon ne bhi isamen badi bhoomika nibhaai he
 There was no shortage of lawyers in India at the time the Constitution was implemented

 1957 main jab china azaad hua tab vahaan maatr 3000 vakil the
 It is not that this process has stopped today, people have become shy about their rights
 balki jo buniyaad us vaqt padi thi usee kaa nateeja he ki aaj bhi aise vakil hai jo aam logon ke adhikaron kii ladaai ke liye aage aa jate hai or apane samay main samvidhan or uski aatma ko dhadkate rahane ke liye oxigen kii kami nahin hone dete hai

 When 46-year-old Harsimrat Kaur Badal got a chance to meet US President Barack Obama who was visiting India as a dinner invitation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, she wore her best silk sari for these special moments
 agle hi din unhen ek het mail mili
 The mail sender wrote, "you have always raised our head by wearing a salwar-kameez, but when the opportunity came to show your culture, you wore a sari
" '' anya logon kii bhi kuch aisi hi soch thi
 Harsimrat is not just an MP, as the wife of Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, she also represents her state in the capital
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki sansad main unki do sabase kareebi dost purv mukhyamantriyon kii betiyaan hai-sharad pavaar kii 43 varshiya beti supriya sule or em

 Sangma's 32-year-old daughter Agatha and Akhilesh Yadav's 35-year-old wife Dimple
 dimple sansad ke is satr se apane sansadeey kariyar kii shuruyaat karengi
 Soft-spoken, convent educated Dimple Yadav is a refreshing change in the traditional brand of Hindipatti leaders
 sansad main unka pahunchnaa unke pati kii takat kaa pratik he
 He had to wait for three years to avenge the humiliating defeat suffered by the Congress in the Firozabad Lok Sabha by-election in 2009
 june, 2012 main akhilesh ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main jeet ke kuch din baad hi dimple kannauj upachunaav ke liye khadi ho gayi
 This time no party could muster the courage to fight the Samajwadi Party (SP) and they were elected unopposed
 yah hairaani kii baat nahin he ki jab unase poocha gaya ki ek mukhyamantri ke rup main apane pati ke pradarshan ko ve kitne ank dengi to unhone palak jhpakaae bina unhen das main se aath ank de daale
 The power has boosted the pair's confidence
 haal main ek kaarykram main jab akhilesh ne suna ki unki patni ko saundarya or budhimatta kaa sangam bataaya ja rahaa he tab unhone jhukkar thodi oonchi aawaaj main hi patni ke kaan main kaha, ''tum pehla chunaav haar gai thim na?''ye sab sansad ke liye nai jarur hai lekin ve satta ke liye nishchit rup se nai nahin hai
 Of course indirectly, she has been tasting power due to her powerful surname
 harsimrat kahati hai, ''meri raajnneeti kaa maapdand yahi he ki mere sasur (prakaash singh badal) ko mujh par sharminda na hona pade
 Lest people say Badal Sahib's daughter-in-law and shake her head
 '' lekin kisi bhi achche saansad kii tarah ve sarkaar ko gher kar kuch atirikt hasil karne se peeche nahin hatatin
 Due to his efforts, Prakash Singh Badal had to announce the recruitment of women in the Punjab Police
 unhen is baat par bhi garv he ki 2011 main antarrashtriya pratispardhaa kaa aayojan karke sukhbir ne kabddi ko nayaa jivan diya he
 She says, "of the 17 teams, four were women, but for men, the prize money was Rs 2 crore
" thi vahiin mahilaon ke liye 50,000 rupye
 i argued with Sukhbir on this discrimination
 unhone kaha ki ve is saal inaam kii rakam badha denge or jab tak ve aisa nahin karte, main ladaai jari rakhuungi
 In private moments, she calls her husband Sukhbir and publicly calls Sukhbir Ji, as traditionally Punjabi men are called their wives
 kabhi bhi sir par bina dupattey ke na dikhne vaali harsimrat kahati hai, ''unhen yah pasand he
 "the powerful Punjabis do not hesitate to fight on the right thing
" unhone disambar, 2009 main apane pehle bhaashan main 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon kaa masalaa uthaaya tha
 "there is no point in waiting for the law to come into force," she says
 main apane saamaajik sandesh prasaarit karne kaa sarvshereshth madhyam hum or jo chaahati hum, vah badlaav laa sakati hum
 Recently Supriya Sule has been made the head of the newly formed youth wing of NCP women
 ve bataati hai, ''ham shiksha or swasthya ke muddon ko badhaava dete hai or mahilaon ko unke adhikaron ke bare main jaagruk karte hai
 "some people believe that Pawar is preparing his daughter for a more meaningful role in the party
" lekin is par supriya rukhaai se kahati hai, ''mere pita salaah dene main udaartaa nahin dikhaate
 On the question of dynastic politics, Kanimozhi laughs, "is that why you are not doing the story?" Kanimozhi sometimes disagreed with her father's politics before becoming an MP
 shaadi se pehle sex ke bare main abhinetri khushboo ke bayaan ke khilaaf apni party ke nazariye kaa unhone samarthan nahin kiya tha
 She says, "I have done this whenever i have the freedom to disagree with my father
" ''kanimoli ko jab 2ji ghotaale main kathith bhoomika ke liye 2011 main jail bhej diya gaya to unhen satta ke sameekaran ke andhere paksh ke rup main dekha gaya
 Talking about her time behind bars, she says, "in a way, it makes you stronger
 jab aap ek suvidhajanak jivan ji rahe hote hai to bahut sari chizon se anjaan hote hai
 But once you get out of all this, you have to face many limitations - of yourself and the people and things around you
 bhaavnaatmak rup se aap or majboot ho jate hai
 When his brothers were fighting for power in Tamil Nadu, Kanimozhi was sent to Delhi to become the national face of the DMK
 ve kahati hai, ''main nahin samajhati ki kisi ek vyakti ke liye party kaa cheharaa bananaa sahi he
 "interestingly, after his prison innings, his stature has increased in the party because many people believe that he has been made a scapegoat
" sooti sari, hair clip, naak main stad, sone kii chudiyaan or chaandi kii bichhiya pahanakar ve aatmavishvaas ke saath sansad jaati hai
 She also has a soft leather handbag
 unka sabase acha shringaar aatmavishvaas kii vah abha he jo unhen apane vansh se mili he
 With a slightly shy smile, Dimple admits, "I am a little nervous about speaking in Parliament
" '' par ve yah bhi jaanati hai ki jab ve apana pehla bhaashan dene ke liye khadi hongi to unke sasur mulaayam apane 22 saansadon kii takat ke saath unka samarthan karne ke liye maujuud rahenge

 ) bihar board ke inter ke nattejey mangalvaar ko ghoshit kiye gaye
 The result of the dispute started soon after the results were announced
 sabase pehle is baat par vivaad hua ki bihar board ke 64 fisadi chaatr pariksha main fail ho gaye or ab taaja vivaad bihar board ke arts topper ganesh kumaar ko lekar hua he
 In the 12th examination of Bihar Board, he chose music as a subject, scoring 65 out of 70 practical marks
 sangeet jaise vishay main itnaa zyada ank dekh yah sawaal uth rahe hai ki kahin ganesh kumaar farji topper to nahin? rigelt ke baad se ganesh laapata bhi bataaya ja rahaa tha, haalanki ajtak kii team ne use dhundh nikaala
 It was also clear in the conversation with him that he had no knowledge of music
 ajtak kii team ne ganesh se jab unke laapata hone ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone bataaya ki unke chachaa kaa dehanth ho gaya tha or vah usee main gaye the
 When asked the reason for being the top, he had said, 'study diligently with hard work and topped because of that hard work
 ' ganesh ko sangeet kii praayogic pariksha (practical) main 70 main 65 ank mili hai, aise main andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhen sangeet kaa acha gyaan hoga, lekin ajtak samvaadadaata ne jab unase kuch sawaal puche to unki kalai khul gai
 He did not even have basic knowledge like Antare and Mukde
 ganesh kumaar jharkhand ke giridih kaa rahane vaala he, lekin inter kii padhai karne ke liye vah 250 kilometre dur bihar ke samastipur pahunchaa
 Here he joined Ramanandan Singh Jagdish Narayan College in 2015
 vahiin 'aaj tak' kii team ganesh ke college bhi gai
 During the investigation, the team till date got the admission form of Ganesh, which he had submitted while enrolling in the college in 2015
 admician form par ek najar daalate hi usamen kai khamiyaan najar ain
 1
 aakhir kyon ganesh kumaar ne giridih se 250 kilometre dur samastipur main inter kii padhai ke liye daakhila liya?2
 Ganesh has shown his date of birth as 2 June 1993 in the admission form
 jiskaa matlab vah 24 saal kaa he
 The age of a student who takes the Inter examination is usually between 17 and 19 years
 3
 On which day Ganesh took admission in Inter College, the date is not mentioned in the admission form
 4
 Being a boy, Ganesh chose subjects like Home Science and Music during his studies at Inter
 5
 What is the local address not mentioned in Ganesh's admission form, although the permanent address is written as Giridih, Jharkhand
 aaj tak ne jab ganesh ke inter college ke sansthaapak sachiv jawahar prasad se baat kii to ganesh kumaar ke arts main top karne ko lekar unhen bhi bada aashcharya hua
 Aaj Tak Hath is also a 12th marksheet of Ganesh
 jisamen usne top kiya he
 According to the marksheet, Ganesh has scored 65 out of 70 in music, which is quite surprising
 yahi nahin, ganesh ne hindi main 92 ank praapt kiye hai
 When Aaj Tak spoke to Ganesh's family members in Giridih, he said that Ganesh has not visited Giridih for the last 4 years
 gauratlab he ki aaj tak ne pichley saal toppers ghotaale kaa pardaafash kiya tha
 Because of which this year Bihar Board had increased the rigidity of the examination process
 bihar main is baar 64 fisadi chaatr fail ho gaye
 But after the results were announced, the entire examination process of Bihar Board has been mired in controversies once the arts topper Ganesh Kumar went underground

 Delhi Police will conduct Psychological Autopsy in the case of death of 11 people of the same family in Burari
 psychological autopsi main yah dekha jaataa he ki vyakti apni mrityu se pehle kis manodasha main rahaa hoga
 Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences (ibhas), said that the two kinds of things that are coming up in the case of death of 11 members of the same family in Burari should be combined rather than seen separately
 gauratlab he ki buraadi cond main ek sambhaavna yah jataai gai he ki mritkon ne aadhyatmik vishwaas ke vasheebhoot hokar khudakushi kii hogi
 The second possibility is that the dead may have committed suicide due to psychological disorder
 dilli police neburadi kandamen ek july ko mrit paae gaye 11 logon kii manovaigyanik autopsi karaane kaa faisla kiya he
 About this, Desai said that it would be very difficult to do this because no member of the family living in that house survived
 manovaigyanik autopsi main yah dekha jaataa he ki vyakti apni mrityu se pehle ke kis manodasha main rahaa hoga
 This autopsy is done through information received from the family of the deceased, persons in social contact and other things
 isamen mritkon kii kuch hafte yaa kuch maheene pehle kii manodasha jaanane kii bhi koshish kii jaati he
 Desai said, "but the difficulty here is that it is not just a matter of one person but of 11 members and no family member living in that house is alive, due to which the conditions are limited in nature
" Can be done
 baharhaal, likhit record kaaphi hai, jinke vishleshan se police ke ab tak ke nishkarshon kii pushti ho sakegi
 Amidst discussing the two types of possibilities, Desai said that he believes it is a phenomenon caused by the combined effects of both
 unhone kaha, ''kai saal tak aadhyatmik aasthaa or reeti-rivaajon ko lekar puure parivaar main bahut thos samuhik sambandh hone ke kaaran ghar main prabhaav rakhane vaale ek sadsy kii maansik beemaari ko isamen sahaj saath mil gaya
 In the context of the Burari incident, Desai stressed the need to revisit the Mental Health Care Act 2017
 centre ne haal main is kanoon ko adhishuchet kiya he
 He said that it has made it difficult to treat a mentally ill person
 unhone kaha, ''buraadi cond niti banane waalon, doctoron, nyaaypalika, police or samaaj ke liye jaagane kaa vakt he
 So that they do not leave mentally ill people without care or treatment
 ''visheshgyon ne bataaya ki manovaigyanik autopsi yah spasht karne kii koshish karti he ki kisi vyakti ne apni jaan kyon lee
 It analyzes medical records
 mitron evam parijan kaa saakshaatkaar kiya jaataa he or mrityu se pehle uski manodasha par shodh kiya jaataa he
 Police are awaiting final postmortem report and forensic report in Burari case
 vah shavon ke visra ko bhi forensik jaanch ke liye bhejegi taaki pataa lagaaya ja sake ki kahin mritkon ko jehar to nahin diya gaya tha
 The initial autopsy report stated that all 11 people died due to hanging from the rope and there were no marks of struggle or injury on their bodies

 The Thackeray family may have said many things about the North Indians, but Congress leader Digivjay Singh has claimed with evidence that the Thackeray family had migrated from Magadha in Bihar to Madhya Pradesh and then migrated from there
 bihar ke logon ke khilaaf aag ugalane vaale raaj thakare ko lekar digvijay singh ne aise saboot pesh kiye he jo unako tilamila sakate hai
 Digvijay Singh says that the ancestors of the Thackeray family actually came from Bihar
 digvijay singh ne baqayda saboot dete hue kaha he ki maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri manohar joshi ne apane shasankaal main ek kitaab chhapavayi thi jo raaj thakare ke dada prabodhankaar thakare kii jeevani thi
 It is written on page 45 that the Thackeray family is originally from Magadha Bihar
 baad main wo madhyapradesh gaya jahaan dhar main bas gaya phir vahaan se mubai aayaa
 Now the question is, if all this is true, then on whom does Raj Thackeray, Uddhav Thackeray drink water and curse Biharis
 jab wo khud hi bihar ke rahane vaale hai to wo kisi ko permit dene kii baat kaise kar sakate hai
 Anyway, Mumbai was once a city of seven islands, where the residents were actually fishermen, everyone else came from outside, then the question is that how Thackeray can call others outsiders would have to be answered

 On Sunday, 23 September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the PMJAY Insurance Scheme or "modicare"
 ise unke shabdadambar kii pehle jaisi visheshta kii tarah hi "duniya kaa sabase bada healthcare program'' bataaya gaya
 The fact is that the National Health Mission of the Government was started in the year 2013, which was proposed by PMJAW
10
 7 karod pariwaron yaa 50 karod labhaarthiyon se zyada jansankhya ko cover karata he
 For more than a decade, schemes like the National Health Insurance Scheme have been running at the national level and at the state level in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Karnataka
 inamen 30,000 se lekar 3 lakh ru
 Health cover is provided per family annually
 piemjeevai yojana isi tarj par laai gai he
 The goal of these schemes is to save people from the huge expenses incurred on hospitalization
 pichhali yojanaon ke adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki logon ko apni jeb se paise kharch karne padate hai, jabaki kaayade se aspataalon ko unka muft ilaaj karnaa chahie
 According to the 71st round of the National Sample Survey, patients who avail insurance cover an average of Rs 18,000 when they go to a private hospital
 apni pocket se dene padate hai
 Private hospitals offer only profitable services
 to jahaan phaayde anischitata ke ghere main hai, vahiin sawaal yah bhi he ki in yojanaon kii laagat kya he? kerala, rajasthan or chhattisgarh jaise rajyon ke anubhavon se pataa chalata he ki in yojanaon ke tahat aspataal lagaataar apane clem badhaate ja rahe hai, premium teji se bad rahe hai or kai maamalon main sarkaron ne bhugtan karnaa band kar diya he
 For example, in Chhattisgarh the premium in the last six years was Rs 300
 se badhkar 1,100 ru
 Has reached
 logon ko mahaj 50,000 ru
 600 crore on insurance to the state this year to provide a health cover of Rs
 kharch karne pade hai
 Most of the claim money goes to the accounts of private hospitals: Data shows that 80 percent of the claim money in Chhattisgarh, more than 70 percent in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra and more than 60 percent in Tamil Nadu goes to private hospitals
 piemjeevai se saarvajanik swasthya seva kii aapurti vyavastha ko nuksaan hoga
 This will make less money available to build / improve government hospitals
 bharat ko un vikasshil deshon se sabak lenaa chahie jinke yahaan universal healthcare system lagu he
 Thailand is an example of this
 thai healthcare system ko britain kii neshnal health sarvice (enechaes) kii tarj par apanaaya gaya he, lekin usne apni jaruraton ke mutabik kuch badlaav kiye hai
 It is built on a strong public health system for primary and secondary healthcare
 isamen 75 fisadi se zyada maamalon main aspataal main marij kii bhartee sarkari aspataalon main hi hoti he
 Private hospitals are selected very carefully for the very high level of care of the third stage
 thailand kii sarkaar swasthya par apane jidipi kaa3 fisadi tak kharch karti he, isaki tulana main bharat sirf 1 fisadi kharch karata he
 The "health and Wellness Centers" (HWC) under the government's Ayushman Bharat scheme are to be upgraded for better primary health care
 lekin kareeb 1,50,000 echdblusi / piechasi ke nirmaan yaa unako unnat banane ke liye mahaj 1,200 karod rupye kaa bajet diya gaya he jo ki naakaafi he
 This gives each center a henna of just 80,000 rupees
 hi milenge
 Community health centers and district hospitals need to be upgraded
 sirf simit ucch stareey sevaaon ke liye hi kuch nijee aspataalon ko panel main rakhaa ja saktaa he, jahaan marijon ko jila aspataalon se refer kiya ja sake
 Our attitude towards human resources in health services should change: more and more local youth should be trained to work as health workers in their districts
 piemjeevai america ke mahange par kharaab nateezon vaale yues health system kii nakal he
 The UK or Thailand model may be better for India
 nai yojana maujuuda swasthya beemaa yojanaon ke phodon ko or bada hi karne vaali he
