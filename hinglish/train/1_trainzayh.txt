 Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Wednesday night that Congress should not read the text of the Constitution

 padhein 30 april ke JOB ALERTCBRI main project assistant ke pad par vaikencirinbhichh main manager kii naukari paane kaa maukabharat electronics limited main ejiniers bharteenevali lignite corporation main vaikencionfaidha main junior clerk or stenographer ke liye karen aavedan What happened before the Lok Sabha elections in the Bharatiya Janata Party was similar to what happened in the Aam Aadmi Party after the Delhi elections
 fark sirf yah tha ki adwani ke aansu, sushamaa swaraj kii kuntha, varisht netaaon kaa hashia pravaas maryaadit or shaleen the jabaki aam aadmi party main yah angadh or bhades dhang se hua, jo gali kii chhutbhaiya siyasat jaisaa tha
 Yet this uniformity between the BJP and the AAP does not worry so much as the disappointment that the hopes of new governance and new politics in India are dying so quickly and the reasons for both are the same
 narendra modi bijepi main prabhutvpurn raajnneeti lekar ubhare the isliye ve sarkaar main apni hi party ke anubhavon kaa paryaapt samavesh nahin kar paae jo gavarnence main doorgaami badlaavon ke liye ek tarah se jaruri tha, natijatan unki taqatvar sarkaar, vajandaar or prabhavi nahin ho saki
 On the other hand, Arvind Kejriwal lost the capital of inclusive politics as soon as he came to power, which separated him from others
 aam aadmi party kaa vighatan, kisi paaramparik raajnneetik dal main foot se zyada doorgaami asar vaali ghatana he
 This party did not appear to be made of the brick slurry from which other political parties are formed
 parivaar, vyakti, pahchaan yaa vichaar par aasthaaen bharat kii paaramparik daleey raajnneeti kii buniyaad hai, jo bhale hi partiyon ko dakiyanoosee banaae rakhti hon lekin inke sahare ekajutata bani rahati he
 Kejriwal has no such identity
 unki 49 din kii behad ghatiya gavarnence ko isliye bhulaayaa gaya kyonki aam aadmi party sahabhaagita, paardarshita or jameen se judi ek nai raajnneeti garh rahi thi, jise bahut-se log aajmaana chaahate the
 After watching aap's farce, it is difficult to say that its leaders did not have ambitions or this party does not have a high command culture like other parties
 alabatta jab aap adarsh kii chotii par chadhakar cheekh rahe hon to aapako raajnneetik asahmatiyon ko sanbhaalane kaa adarshavaadi tarika bhiijad kar lenaa chahie
 Kejriwal's party came to the crossroads in a small set of disagreements, while the traditional parties have been handling even more big controversies
 dilli kii jeet bataati he ki kejariwal ne gavarnence kii taiyaari bhale hi kii ho lekin ek adarsh daleey siyasat unase nahin sadhi jo behatar gavarnence ke liye anivaary he
 As the Chief Minister of Delhi, people know the limits of Kejriwal, however, as the inventor of new politics, his list of expectations was very long
 kejariwal ke paas paanch saal kaa vakt he
 They can give good governance to Delhi but they have missed the opportunity to give good politics
 raajnneetik paimaane par aam aadmi party ab sapa, bijedy, trinmul, diemke jaisi hi ho gai he jo ek rajya tak simit hai
 It is reasonable to doubt the possibilities of national expansion of this new experiment
 kejariwal ke samarthak, jaise aaj yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ko party ke liye gaiyr jaruri or boj sabit kar rahe hai, thik isi tarah narendra modi ke samarthak us vakt party kii puraani peedi ko naakaara bataa rahe the jab bijepi kii rashtriya raajnneeti main modi yug kii shuruyaat ho rahi thi
 Given the tremendous decline in Modi's popularity in nine months (india Today Special Opinion Survey), it is not difficult to realize that Modi's failures in governance have also come out of his model of politics, which has left the high command culture and dissenting party In the matter of giving, it proved to be more than the Congress
 pradhanmantri ke taur par modi ke sankalp or sadashyata ke baavjood agar ek saal ke bheetar hi unki sarkaar kisi aam sarkaar jaisi hi dikhne lagi he to isaki do vajahen hai
 The BJP, under the leadership of one Modi, had made no preparations for governance and an effective government could not take shape despite a two-major majority
 bijepi chunaav se pehle apni sarkaar kaa vijan dacument tak nahin bana saki thi
 The manifesto came after the commencement of voting
 chunaav kii ubh-chubh main ye baaten ai gai ho gayi lekin sach yah he ki bijepi nai gavarnence ke doordarshee model ke bina satta main aa gai kyonki gavarnence kii tamir gande kaa kaam hi nahin hua or aisa karne vaale log haashie par dhakel die gaye the
 This is the reason that when the government took decisions, they looked different from the election resolutions or were seen repeating the previous government
 satta main aane ke kareeb saal bhar baad bhi modi agar ek damdaar anbhavi or pratibhashali sarkaar nahin garh paa rahe hai jo is vishaal desh kii gavarnence kaa rasayan badalane kaa bharosa jagaati ho to shaayad isaki vajah bhi unka raajnneetik taur tarika he
 Modi wanted to bring Gujarat-like governance to the center, but in fact he brought the Gujarati model of running the BJP into the party's national politics, which does not believe in taking everyone along or considers bravery to play with the average team
 endie kii pichhali sarkaar kaa pehla saal hi nahin balki puraa kaarykaal doordarshee faislon se bharpoor tha
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee could do so much in the opposite atmosphere and coalition government because he had a clear road map of governance and he had the art of saving everyone, bringing out the best of all
 raajnneeti or gavarnence gaharaai se gunthe hote hai
 Modi and Kejriwal could not manage this inter-relation with law
 ab donon hi talkh hakeekat kii ek jaisi jameen par khadey hai
 The tide of expectations has come down
 netaaon ko mahamanav or maseehaa banane kii koshishon par viraam laga he
 With the inauguration of Modi and Kejriwal, an unprecedented treasure of bitter lessons has been raised
 sarkaron kii shuruyaat behad keemtee hoti he kyonki kar dikhaane ke liye zyada samay nahin hota
 Modi and Kejriwal have missed the chance of a great start to governance and politics, yet, when awake, dawn

 However, the three judges were not unanimous on the Ramjanmabhoomi dispute
 justise es you khan ke mutabik yah hinduon kii manyata thi jo 1949 ke kuch dashakon pehle prabal hui ki jahaan par ramalala kii murti virajman hai vahiin ramajnmabhumi hai
 There is no strong evidence for this, Justice Khan believes

 But no mosque was built by breaking a temple
 haalanki is baat ke pramaan mili hai ki us sthaan par jeernsheern avasthaa main mandir ke avshesh thea or masjid ke nirmaan main mandir ke kuch avasheshon kaa upyog hua hoga
 But whether the two sides are Hindu or Muslim cannot prove who owns the disputed land

 However, Justice Khan and Justice Agarwal are unanimous that the disputed Ramjanm land should be three parts

 Even though the Sunni Bakf Board will knock the door of the Supreme Court on this issue, but after this order of the High Court, there is little scope for controversy on many issues
 court ne is baat par khaas tavajjon diya ki yah masalaa hindu aasthaa se judaa he or aapasi sauhaard ke liye sabhi pakshon ko is faisle par amal karnaa chahie
 Overall, a precise and transparent decision on such a disputed issue has rarely been seen in the last 60 years

 In the five-year tenure of PM Narendra Modi, India has lagged behind China in many respects
 china kii sarkari media main yah daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 Lok Sabha elections are being held in India, it is interesting to report such reports in Chinese media
 china ke sarkari akhbaar global times main chhapi ek report main kaha gaya he, 'pashchimi media main is tarah kii baaten ho rahi hai
 It is also true that on the economy front, the gap between China and India has widened considerably
 saal 2018 main chini arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 13
 6 trillion dollars, while the size of the Indian economy was 2
 8 lakh karod dollar kaa tha
 'the newspaper has said,' If India wants to bridge this gap, then its annual economic growth rate should be several times that of China
 lekin china kii tej badhat dar ko dekhte hue aisa lagata nahin ki bharat yah hasil kar paaegaa
 'significantly, in 2014 the size of the Chinese economy is 10
 38 lakh karod dollar kaa tha, jabaki bhartiya arthvyavastha kaa aakaar 2
 04 trillion dollars
 yani 2014 main donon deshon kii arthvyavastha ke aakaar main kareeb 8
 There was a difference of 34 lakh crores which increased to 10 in 2018
 8 lakh karod dollar kaa ho gaya
 Skeptics on the data: According to the news, India's average GDP between 2014 and 2018 in the five-year tenure of the Modi government
 7 fisadi se zyada ho gai he, lekin in aankadon par kai sankhyikee vajahon se andeh kiya ja rahaa he
 The Modi government has changed the way GDP is calculated and the base year itself
 isliye nae aankadon ko hameshaa hi andeh kii najaron se dekha jaataa he
 The report said, 'here, even former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan has raised doubts on these figures
 yani agar mul sankhyikeey tareekon ko apanaaya jaae to modi sarkaar ke dauraan jidipi main growth lagbhag utana hi rahaa he, jitna ki purvavarti manmohan singh sarkaar main tha'global times ne kaha ki modi sarkaar jab satta main ai to uske saamne kaaphi anukool maahaul tha
 Crude oil prices had fallen significantly in the international market
 isaki vajah se mahangaai par bhi ankush rahaa
 Because of this, the Modi government benefited greatly
 lekin notebandi or jiesti jaise sudhaaron se kuch bhram hua or short turm main iskaa arthvyavastha par nakaaratmak asar hua
 The newspaper said, "the gap between the two countries is also widening in terms of manufacturing
 pichley paanch saal main bharat ke menuphaccharing sector main kuch khaas pragati nahin hui he
 The economy is growing without employment under the Modi government
 modi ne har saal ek karod logon ko rojgaar dene kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin sach to yah he ki berogari kii dar kaaphi oonchi he
 It is worth noting that according to the data released by the Indian government, India has been ahead of China in terms of GDP growth every year from 2014 till now except 2017
 saal 2018 main bharat ne arthvyavastha ke maamle main france ko peeche chhodte hue duniya bhar main chathe sthaan par pahunch gaya
 India has achieved many achievements, but experts believe that it is very difficult for India to move ahead of China

 While offering water to the rising sun, the sun appears in the water stream

 Eating at that time, the juice of the food is good for the body

 a dozen people queued as soon as the shutter of the e-mitra kiosk (booth) went up
 inke haathon main aadhaar card, bhamashah or rashan card banavaane ke liye jaruri dastavej hai
 Manju from Dabra village asks, "how long will the card be made?" Kiosk Director Shivkumar Sharma replies, “as soon as you get ready, the message will come in your mobile and reach home in a week
 ” jo aadhaar card pehle chah maheene tak ban kar nahin aata tha, vah hakrate-das din main banakar aane laga he
 Kaushalya Devi lying in the line was cited for the same number of days to become a ration card
 kiyosk ke kaamkaaj ke bare main sharma bataate hai, “jaruri dastavej milane ke baad ab aage kii prakriya main zyada vakt nahin lagata
 “this is the reason that the once-deserted e-mitra kiosks are now inhabited
 alam yah he ki pradesh main kiyosk kii marfat keval pichley sitambar main hi 163 sarkari sevaaon ke 81 lakh kaam hue hai
 If we look at the record of the last four months, people are constantly connecting with the services of e-mitra
 logon ne iske jariye june main 36 lakh, july main 46 lakh, agast me 58 lakh sevaayen lee hai
 Ration cards, Bhamashah cards, original residence proofs, caste certificates, online forms, Aadhaar cards, etc
 were made
 sarkari yojanaon or sevaaon ko janata tak online pahunchane ke liye rajasthan main 2004 main i-mitra yojana shuru kii gai thi
 e-mitra kiosks were established under this
 shuru main yah yojana kaaphi sust thi kyonki inke paas badi sevaayen nahin thim or na hi logon ko i-mitra kiyosk bharosemand lag rahe the
 So they were failing
 vasundhara raaje sarkaar ne satta main aane ke baad teji se i-mitra par sevaaon kaa vistaar kiya
 Currently, the public is receiving 225 services through e-mitra
 baking se judi sevaaon ko bhi isamen jodgaye kii yojana he
 The government has tied up 42 companies to set up e-mitra kiosks in the state
 in companiyon ke jariye 33,391 kiyosk chal rahe hai
 They are around 10,000 in urban areas and 23,000 in rural areas
 inamen 8,000 atal seva kendron main or baaki nijee jagahon par chal rahe hai

 sharma kehete hai, “i-mitra ke prati logon kaa jabardast judaav dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Data online is currently in progress
 uske baad kaam chutkiyon main hone lagegaa
 “the government has set a commission for kiosks in lieu of work
 nijee companiyon ko 25 fisadi or kiyosk ko 75 fisadi kamishan milanaa tay he
 The department deals with the commissioning of free services like electricity, water and telephone bills
 baaki sevaaon jaise rashan card ke liye 30 ru
 , Rs 15 for original residence proof and caste certificate
 , aadhaar namakan ke liye 15 ru
 , 50-50 Rupees of application of electric-water connection
 i-mitra kiyosk sidhe graahakon se charge karte hai
 Sharma explains, “A kiosk in a rural area costs Rs 5,000 per month
 se 15,000 ru
 In urban areas, even more
 ” sara kaam online he to i-mitra kiyosk kii kamai kaa record bhi rahata he, jisase gadabadi kaa andeshaa bhi nahin rahata
 There may not be an online mess but offline loot is happening at these kiosks
 yahaan tak ki kahin-kahin tay shulk se paanch guna adhik raashi vasuuli ja rahi he
 There were 81 lakh works on e-mitra kiosks in the state last month
 isse andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kitni avaidh vasuuli ho sakati he
 In fact, at most kiosks, the fee list is not printed by the government, due to which people get caught in the bluff
 form or photo copy ke naam par bhi atirikt paise vasuul ja rahe hai
 At the same time, related work documents are also being prepared at Atal Seva Kendras, in which the stamp of the village servant or sarpanch has to be stamped
 iske badale bhi sanchaalak atirikt charge karte hai
 Say it early to get it done or fear of being deprived of government schemes, villagers are giving illegal money easily
 deedwanaa ke kisaan netaa bhagirath yadav hansate hue is ore ishaara karte hai, “ye to suvidha shulk hi he, jo pehle babu yaa panchayat ke nichle karmchaaree ko dena padataa tha, par ab is shulk main tunrat kaam ho rahaa he
 "at the same time Ghanshyam Goyal, District Officer of IT and Communication Department, Nagaur, says," We have not received any such complaint
 ” unhone aniyamita baratane par pichley dinon 100 se zyada i-mitra kiyosk par karrwai kii he, jinhone tay shulk kii suchi chaspaan nahin kii thi
 At the same time, the licenses of about a dozen kiosks across the state have been canceled for charging offline charges
 phir bhi lut jari he
 On the other hand, before going to e-friend, customers have to wander even today to get the documents related to work done
 sarkaar par janata se judi sevaaon ko bina sansadhano ke sidhe i-mitra se jodgaye kaa aarope bhi lag rahaa he
 In many villages, even today electricity is scarce, in many villages there is not even a broadband phone connection

 NRI Sarpanch and Nagaur Sarpanch Sangha president Hanman Ram Farauda says, “there are hundreds of villages in the district which do not have broadband facility
 aise main i-mitra kiske sahare kaam karegaa
 However, the government's initiative to bring the services of all departments on e-mitra is paying off and the government work of the people is being done in their area only
 lekin saath hi sarkaar ko i-mitra par nigaraanee bhi jarurat he, varanaa ve janata ke bich sarkaar kii chhavi ko kharaab bhi kar sakate hai

 People of Delhi will still remember that evening of 2007 when former model Geetanjali Nagpal was found on the pavement in Hauz Khas area of south Delhi due to poor mental condition
 is ghatana ke baad dilli hycourt ne 2009 main maansik rogiyon or akeli mahilaon ke sir par chat muhaiyaa karwaane ke uddeshy se dilli sarkaar ko ‘half ve homes’ yaa punarvaas centre banane kaa aadesh diya tha
 But today nothing changed after nine years
 dilli kii sadakon par jagah-jagah aaj bhi apane jivan ke liye sangharsh karte maansik rogi dekhe ja sakate hai
 However, the Mental Research Society of Delhi runs a rehabilitation center called 'tulsi Home' of this variety

 Chandrasekhar Gupta says, "the number of mentally ill and homeless people is increasing rapidly
 aise logon ke liye liye punarvaas centre kii sakht jarurat he jahaan ve saamaanya jivan jeena siikhnaa shuru kar sakate hai
 Tulsi Home is one of the few Half Way Homes in Delhi where people suffering from mental illnesses like Schizophrenia, Dementia and Bipolar are sheltered
 lekin yahaan bhi simit sankhya main hi rogiyon ko rakhaa ja saktaa he, jo aise peediton kii sankhya ko dekhte hue oont ke munh main jire ke samaan he
 According to data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, one fourth of the mental patients present in India are homeless
 philhal dilli main aise paanch half ve home rohinee, narela, dwarka main banakar taiyaar hai
 But these have not yet been opened to the homeless and mental patients
 dow
 "there are very few mental hospitals and rehabilitation centers for the mentally unwell in the delhi-ncr," says Gupta
 jo hai ve unamem bhi kshamta se adhik log rah rahe hai
 Earlier, social organizations and patients' families used to take care of them, but nowadays families are becoming smaller, in such a situation, people do not want to take care of mentally ill families
 yahi vajah he ki is tarah ke zyada log sadakon par ghoomte dikhaai dene lage hai
 There are very few people who get full treatment

 The building of the Government Half Way Home in Delhi is ready, but these have not been started yet
 ’’ In the wake of the Lok Sabha elections, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has now knocked on Twitter as well
 mayawati ke aadhikarik twitor handle par folbers kii sankhya kaaphi teji se bad rahi he
 In the last 8 hours, the number of followers of Mayawati on Twitter has started from 4 thousand and has crossed 32 thousand
 hamane is dauraan unke folbers kii sankhya kaa vishleshan bhi kiya he
 Around 4 thousand people were following his Twitter handle at around 10 am on Wednesday morning, which has reached beyond 30 thousand at 7 pm
 dopaher 12 baje mayawati ke folbers kii sankhya 18 hajaar ke kareeb or 1 baje 19 hajaar ke paar thi

 Most of the followers are supporters of the Bahujan Samaj ideology and supporters of the BSP
 iske alaava vibhinn dalon ke netaa or patrkaar bhi unhen twitor par follow karnaa shuru kar chuke hai
 Tejashwi Yadav and TMC leader Derek o'brien are also following him
 mayawati ne aadhikarik bayaan ke jariye is twitor handle kii pushti kii he
 The BSP chief usually stays away from public forums and mostly she favors her party only by issuing statements
 kuch maukey par unhone press conference ke jariye bhi apni baat kahi he
 The party does not even have an official spokesperson, so Mayawati's Twitter handle will serve as a platform for bsp's favor and Mayawati's statements

 It said that the BJP is cursing the SP-BSP alliance for diverting the attention of the people due to not fulfilling its election promises and is engaged in a conspiracy to defame the leaders of opposition parties

 haal main varun dhawan starer judwa 2 bhi 100 karod club kaa hissaa bani
 Today's hit faces like Varun Dhawan, Jacqueline Fernandez and Taapsee Pannu were a part of the 1997 remake of Salman Khan's hit Judwaa
 bataa den ki film abtab lagbhag 119 karod kii kamai kar chuki he
 On the other hand, this film was successful in breaking the record of Varun Dhawan's film released this year, Badrinath Ki Dulhania
 Review: time paas masala film nikali varun kii judwa-2, pehle vaali baat nahidhakshay kumaar kii film toilet ek premakatha bhi aath din main hi 100 karod kamaane vaali film ban gai thi
 Akshay Kumar's Yeh Yal became the second film to join the 100 crore club
 salmaan khan kii id relies film tubalite bhale hi is saal kii lo arner film rahi ho lekin is film ne bhi 119 karod kaa bijness kiya
 For these 5 reasons, twins can be amazing, new records will be made at the box office! Varun Dhawan's film Brithinath Ki Dulhaniya also earned 116 crores within 14 days of release
 varun-aalia kii jodi to logon ko pasand ai lekin film flop rahi
 Akshay Kumar's film Jolly LLB 2, which debuted at the beginning of the year, earned 100 crores in 12 days
 film ko logon ne pasand bhi kiya lekin iske first part ko jitna saraahaa gaya tha vaisaa charm is film ko nahin mila
 'raees' cheat with Hrithik? In a shock, the 150 crore rupees of 'kaabil', Roshan's Roshan's film Kaabil was also liked by the box office but failed to become a hit
 film ko 19 din lag gaye 100 karod kamaane main

 taarikh 3 farvari, vaqt raat ke dedh baje, jagah rohinee police stesan
 Suddenly the police control room rings
 phone uthaate hi duusari taraf se awaz aati he: 'maine apni bivi or bachche kaa katl kar diya he, aap aa jaaie
 'before the police could understand anything, he also tells the address of his house
 makaan number 112, pocket 11, sector 22, rohinee or iske baad phone cat jaataa he
 The caller dials a number again after a few seconds of cutting the phone
 number dakshini dilli ke bhogal ilaake kaa tha or phone usne apane sasuraal main kiya tha
 On the other hand, on picking up the phone, he again says: 'I have killed Shweta and Proud, you come
 ' itnaa kehete hi wo phone kaat detaa he
 On the other hand, the in-laws are stunned as they keep the phone, but then they think that perhaps their son-in-law Nitin is joking
 lihaaza wo palat kar usee vakt apane damaad ko phone karte hai or kehete hai ki itani raat is tarah kaa mazaaq acchhee baat nahin he
 The same voice again comes from the other side: 'I am not joking, i have literally killed both, you come
 ' iske baad phone cat jaataa he
 As soon as the news is received on the phone, the police immediately reach the address mentioned
 daravaaza khulte hi police nitin ke bare main puuchhati he
 All the householders were in deep sleep then, they did not know anything
 wo bas itnaa jaanate the ki nitin apni bivi shweta or chaar saal ke bete garv ke saath apane kamare main so rahaa he
 The police go directly to Nitin's room, the door was locked from inside
 kaaphi peetane or awaz dene par bhi darwaja nahin khulata
 So the police forcefully decides to break the door and then somehow break the latch and open the door
 andar ajab manzar tha, nitin bed par baitha tha or usee bed par uske baraabar main do log so rahe the, shweta or garv donon razai ke andar the
 Nitin opens his mouth for the first time upon seeing the police and family members
 nitin kahata he ki maine apni bivi or bete ko maar diya he, par inhen thand naa lag jaae isliye inpar razaai daal di he
 Now, take me where i want to go
 iske baad police jaise hi razai hataati he nitin kii sachai saamne aa jaati he
 Shweta and Pride were literally lying in front, both were strangled and killed
 kaatil, kaatil kaa ikraarnama or do-do laashen police ke saamne thim
 The case was as clear as a mirror, but then the police are shocked as soon as they see Nitin
 jo shaks pichley chah saal se apane pairon par khadey hona to dur bagaiyr kisi kaa sahaara liye uthakar baith bhi nahin saktaa ho, wo bhala do-do katl kaise kar saktaa he?nitin ne pehle police ko or phir apane sasuraal phone kar apni bivi or bete ke katl kii baat kabuuli thi
 Seeing the camera, Nitin is hiding his face in a blanket, actually Nitin cannot walk
 chah saal pehle hue ek sadak haadase main qamar se neeche kaa uskaa puraa hissaa bekaar ho gaya
 Since then, he was in a wheelchair and that is why even after his arrest the policemen are carrying him in his lap
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya aisi haalat main nitin apane haathon se do-do khun kar saktaa he? kya shweta itani aasaani se uske kaabo main aa sakati thi? kya shweta ne khud ko bachaane kii koshish nahin kii hogi? or kya gharavaalon ko kamare se koi bhi aawaaj sunai nahin di? inhen sawaalon ke saath police ne jab maamle kii tafteesh shuru kii to pataa chalaa ki guruuvar raat tak ghar main sab kuch thik tha
 Rather, there was a festive atmosphere at home on Thursday night
 do farvari ko nitin or shweta kii shaadi kii chhathi saalagirah thi
 On this occasion, a party was held in the house, Nitin and Shweta's family members also attended the party
 iske baad kareeb aadhi raat se pehle party khatm hui or sabhi apane-apane kamare main sone chale gaye
 Nitin was also sleeping in his room with Shweta and Garve, Garv was supposed to go to school in the morning
 chunki nitin chal-phir nahin saktaa tha lihaaja shweta ne kamare kii kundi andar se khud band kii hogi
 According to the family members, for a moment after the entire party and after the party, it did not feel that Nitin was angry or upset, he was laughing and talking
 par kamare ke andar jane ke ghante bhad baad hi aakhir aisa kya ho gaya jo usne apane haathon se apni bivi or bete ko maar daalaa? aakhir saalagirah kii party ke baad der raat aisa kya hua ki nitin ne apane hi haathon se apni bivi or bete ko maar daalaa? or phir khud hi police or sasuraal waalon ko phone kar katl kii jaankaree bhi di?to shuruaati tafteesh ke baad police bhi philhal yahi maan kar chal rahi he ki donon katl nitin ne hi kiye hai
 Actually, the latch of the door of the room that was slaughtered was closed from inside
 kamare main nitin, shweta auki garv ke alaava or koi nahin tha
 Even Nitin himself could not open the latch from inside
 police ke mutabik jab nitin ko der raat giraftaar kiya gaya tab usne sharaab pi rakhi thi, wo nashe main tha
 That is, he killed both of them drunk, but why did he kill? According to police, Nitin and Shweta had married love and both were very happy even after marriage
 par wheel chair par aane ke baad se hi nitin chidchida ho gaya tha, shweta kaa naukari par janaa use akharane laga
 He started getting suspicious about Shweta, perhaps he was also starting to have some fear that Shweta might leave her with disabilities and hence she killed the mother-son
 par khud shweta ke ghar waalon kaa kuch or hi kahana he
 He has his own story about this double murder and Nitin's family members are also involved in this story
 dohare qatl kii is dardanaak kahani ke kai pahalu hairaan karne vaale hai
 Nitin and Shweta were married to their own will
 donon ek duusare ko pyaar karte the, nitin ke gharavaalon kaa kahana he ki shweta ke gharavaale is rishte ko pasand nahin karte the
 But after the marriage, the relationship was better, then the accident happened and Nitin fell on the wheel chair
 nitin ke gharavaale bataate hai ki haadase ke baad shweta ke gharavaale, uski shaadi nitin ke bhai se karwaanaa chaahate the
 The helpless and unemployed Nitin could not even stand up from the wheel chair
 ghar kaa karch nitin ke do bhaaiyon kii kamai par chalata tha
 During this time, Nitin's wife Shweta started going to Laxmi Nagar to work in an NGO, but Nitin did not like her wife to work at all
 ab ek or ahm baat
 
 
 The family members of Shweta are also raising doubts about Nitin's brothers in this murder
 darasal, haadase ke evaz main nitin ko 21 lakh rupye kaa muawza mila tha
 Nitin had made his wife and child a nominee, so is there any connection with this double murder? The police is looking into all aspects

 world iconomic forum (WEF) 2018 ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ke vijan main unke pramukh kaaryakramon se ek mek in india ko badhaava dena shaamil ho saktaa he

 Prior to his speech, PM Modi tweeted, 'in Davos i would like to share my vision on India's future engagement with the international community

 ' take this! Camel means the Titanic of the desert is sinking
 ise bachaane ke tamaam sarkari upaay naakaafi sabit hote dikh rahe hai
 a decade ago, Indian camels were ranked third in terms of population after Sudan and Somalia
 lekin inaki gananaa ke taaja aankade bataate hai ki ab ye 10wein sthaan par pahunch gaye hai
 To show the dangerous scene of the desert 'titanic' sinking, it would be necessary to keep some figures
 san 2001 main desh main uunton kii taadaad 10 lakh se zyada thi
 Keep in mind that camels are counted in the states every four years
 aakhri gananaa 2011 main hui thi lekin uske aankade abhi uplabdh nahin
 And if we talk about Rajasthan, then camel population in the state came down to half in 2007 as compared to 2001
 is hisaab se aaj kii sthiti kaa anumaan aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Most camels in the country are found in Rajasthan
 2007 main 4
 36 lakh camels were left to swim in the desert sea
 chaar saal baad jaahir he, isamen bhi kami ai hi hogi
 The biggest reason for the ever-decreasing population of camels in the country and the state is the frequent use of this animal
 pehle rajasthan ke hajaaron kimi ke retile samandar main yatayaat ke liye or jutai vagairah ke kaam main sabase upyogi saadhan oont hi hua karata tha
 But due to the increasing use of machines in farming, their need is constantly decreasing
 duusari ore, vikaas kii tej lahar main charaagaah bhi saaf hote ja rahe hai, jo uunton ke liye chaare ke sabase bade strot rahete aae hai
 Animal Farm Superintendent of National Camel Research Center, the largest research center of camels in Bikaner, Dr

 The example of Nagaur bull is also similar
 ’ yah baat solah aane sach he ki pashupalkon ke paas paryaapt charaagaah hi nahin rah gaye
 Bhikharam Raika of Mahajan village in Bikaner claims that there is no land left for pasture in his village
 iske alaava paas main hi chalane vaali sena kii firing range ke liye chaar maheene vahaan uskaa kabja rahata he
 There was also some charanote and pulse land around the villages where the cattle grazed
 ab vahaan bhi chaare ke naam par kuch nahin bachaa he
 It is also true that other domesticated animals like buffalo, cow, sheep and goat are proving more beneficial than camels
 pashupalkon ko unase thodi-bahut kamai ho jaati he
 They also cost less and do not have to handle so much
 haal hi main ai vishwa pashu gananaa kii report un tamaam sarkari upayon par sawaal uthaa rahi he, jinke naam par karodon ru
 Have been spent
 or oont hai ki badhane kii bajaae kam hote ja rahe hai
 However, arguments are also being made for all the efforts

 Patil says, 'we are trying to prove the usefulness of this animal through our schemes
 uunton ke sangrakshan ke liye ab sarkari str par oont paalkon ko sangathit kiya jayega
 The Center has chalked out a plan for this, in which work will be done around their living place for qualitative improvement in the breed of camels
 range str par breeding plan taiyaar kiya gaya he
 'let us assume for a while that government schemes for conservation of camels are going in the right direction
 par lakh take kaa sawaal yahi nikalakar aata he ki kisaan aakhir uunton ko paalen kyon? kya tamaam sarkari mahakme or unki yojanaayen is pashu ko duusare dudharu pashuon ke baraabar laa khadaa kar paaengi?anusandhan centre kii or duusari sarkari yojanaon ne bhi pashupalkon ko is pashu kii ore aakarshith karne kii koshish kii he lekin kharch yani laagat or shuddh laabh ke bich kii duuri na ke baraabar hone se pashupaalak is jahaaj se safar karne se ab batch hi rahe hai
 The research, however, did many good and successful experiments

 Now cheese can also be made from its milk
 anusandhan adhikari is baat kii bhi pushti karte hai ki oontni ke doodh se bani chizon kii gunvattta kai guna zyada hoti he
 Patil adds here, 'the government should sell these products in the super market like other products
 ’ unhen puraa bharosa he ki ek din yah utpaada jamkar bikenge
 That means this ship will not sink? Patil feels the same
 bikaner sthit is anusandhan centre main abhi deshbhar ke uunton kii chaar naslon par kaam ho rahaa he
 These are Bikaneri, Jaisalmeri, Mewari and Kachchi
 centre ke paas is vakt kareeb 300 oont hai
 Researches are also being done to treat diseases caused in humans with antigens found in camels
 asal main desh main uunton kii 4 prajatiyaan pai jaati hai
 Three of them are in Rajasthan alone - Bikaneri, Jaisalmeri and Mewari
 chauthi prajati kacchi gujarat ke kuccha ilaake main pai jaati he
 Of these, the number of camels of Mewari and Kachchi species has seen a rapid decline in recent years
 jaisalmeri oont baaki uunton se kaaphi tej daudte hai
 These camels of high stature, thin and long legs live in the sandy docks of Jaisalmer, Barmer and Jodhpur
 seemaa par chaukasee ke liye inkaa bade paimaane par istemaal hota he
 But if their population keeps decreasing like this, then they will be difficult to get for this work too

 8 november, 2016
 At eight o'clock at night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation announced the closure of 500 and 1000 notes
 modi ke elaan ke saath hi maano deshbhar main halchal-si much gai thi
 Everyone was running towards the ATM, someone was going towards the petrol pump
 kisi ko kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa tha ki ye ekadam kya ho gaya
 The opposition termed the government's decision as democracy black day and continuously opposed it
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi kaa elaan karte hue logon se 50 din tak sahyog karne kii maang kii thi
 During demonetisation, there was a huge crowd of people outside banks and atms
 modi sarkaar ne lagaataar notebandi ko ek safalataa bataaya he or vipaksh aaj kaala diwas ke rup main iskaa virodh kar rahaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also thanked the people on Twitter on the anniversary of r-parnotbandi in the opposition
 unhone likhaa 'kaale dhan or bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se uthaae sakht kadamon kaa bad chadhakar samarthan ke liye bharatvasiyon ko main naman karata hum'i bow to the people of India for steadfastly supporting the several measures taken by the Government to eradicate corruption and black money
 # antiblackmoneyday — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) November 8, 2017 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi tweeted and attacked the Modi government
 unhone notebandi ko ek traasadee bataaya
 He also tweeted along with a picture that went viral during demonetisation
 unhone likhaa, 'ek aansu bhi hukumat ke liye khatra he, tumne dekha nahin ankhon kaa samundar hona

 in kii special kawarej
 Read every news related to demonetisation, understand in the gallery what the impact was on the life of the common man
 video main dekhen iske phaayde or nuksaan
 Demonetisation really shot up the fast-growing Indian economy! Demonetisation shot into the legs of the country's fast-running economy
 jane maane arthshaastri or upie kaarykaal main neshnal adwijuri council ke sadsy rahe zyaan drez ne notebandi kii tulana karte hue kaha tha ki yah kaam thik usee tarah he jaise ek tej raftaar se bhaagti racing car ke pahie par kisi ne goli maar di ho
 People said on Twitter - Today, November 8, just a delay to say friends, a user wrote on Twitter, 'today is November 8, and it's just a delay to say friends'
 vahiin ek anya yujar ne likhaa ki mere pyaare deshavaasiyon kii aaj pehle saalagirah he
 The country's first 'cashless' village was formed after demonetisation, now it runs here only when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the closure of the old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees on 8 November 2016, when the wind of cashless was started
 isi bayaar main madhya pradesh ke ek gaanv ko sabase pehla 'cashles gaanv' qaraar diya gaya tha
 Notebook of demonetisation: After all, who got what from this whole exercise? In this queue for demonetisation, where some people lost their lives, wedding-like events became difficult in many homes
 shuruaati kuch hafton tak to aisa laga ki maano duniya kii sabase tej bhaagane vaali arthvyavastha ladkadaa kar gir gai he
 Know the word of the Reserve Bank, when, why and who took the decision on demonetisation, the Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel and the Finance Ministry had asked many important questions on the demonetization decision
 in sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye unhen 20 janvari 2017 tak kaa samay diya he
 This committee of Parliament wanted to know from the Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance, when, how and by whom the decision of demonetisation was taken
 bharat main bahes, lekin in deshon main fail raheen notebandi jaisi koshishendesh main karodon logon ko samaj nahin aayaa ki aakhir is faisle kaa kya makasad he or vah apane paas raddi qaraar die ja chuke karency kaa kya karen
 Now one year has passed between demonetisation
 aaj sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki kya notebandi kendra sarkaar kaa sahi faisla tha yaa phir samay ne is faisle ko galat sabit kar diya he?notebandi kaa nahin hua siyaasi nuksaan, BJP kii ek ke baad ek jeetasattadhari bijepi ne ise kaledhan ke khilaaf karrwai bataaya tha, to vipakshi dalon ne notebandi ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya
 After a few days of demonetisation, municipal and assembly elections were held in many states of the country, BJP won one after another and the opposition parties suffered heavy losses
 notebandi ke paksh main the nobel vijeta richard, 2000 ke note ko bataaya galatain samarthakon main arthshaastra main nobel puraskaar vijeta professor richard theller kaa naam bhi shaamil he
 Let me tell you that Richard Thaler had supported it during demonetisation and also tweeted in support of it
 theller ne ise karpshan ke khilaaf ladaai kaa ek pehla kadam bataaya tha
 'palturam' on demonetisation: first supported, then apologized when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced it, only then his protest started across the country
 lekin kuch logon ne is faisle kaa khulkar swaagat kiya tha
 Many celebrities were also involved in these
 notebandi kii barsi par padhie anndaata ke ghar kaa haal
 
 
 Demonetisation completed one year
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki saal bhar unhone sirf maar jheli he
 Farmers allege that cashless transactions have also done their worst
 aise hi ek kisaan kaa puraa saal kaise beetaa
 
 
 Aaj Tak tried to understand this
 notebandi: kya hua aam aadmi kii 10 hajaar rupee bachat ke PM modi ke vaade kanotbandi ke phaayde ke saath-saath piem modi ne vaada kiya tha ki is kadam se desh main aam aadmi kii jeb main prati maah 10 rupee tak kii bachat kar sakegaa
 Villagers become public money account in demonetisation? Learn what happened in a year, if you talk about the data, then the central government launched the poor welfare scheme to keep a book of black money, only Rs 5,000 crore has been collected
 isi paise ko aaj kii taarikh main notebandi se baraamad hua kalaadhan kaha ja saktaa he
 Modi government has trouble with cash but is on top gear in Japan After the announcement of demonetisation on 8 November in the Cash Economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi went on a tour of Japan
 khasbaat he ki kendra sarkaar ne desh main notebandi kaa elaan kar bharat ko digital iconomi banane kii kavayad kii
 But soon after this announcement, PM Modi arrived on a visit to Japan from the cash economy which was there and that too in the top gear
 notebandi: pehle chhini raunak, ab ek saal baad patari par lautaa vyapaar8 november ko notebandi kaa ek saal puraa ho rahaa he
 During this one year, there has been a lot of change in people's thinking about demonetisation and their approach towards it
 vahiin kaarobaari jagat kaa bhi kuch aisa hi haal he
 Demonetisation: Digital Payments Increase Trouble of Small Businesses, People Trouble Last year, after demonetisation, Pramod also started to pay attention to digital payments in his profession

 Appeal to court, IPL matches Venue difficult to change- Rajiv Shuklaidian Premier League chairman Rajiv Shukla has said in a statement to 'the Hindu' that it is now difficult to change the venue of IPL matches
 shukla ne maharashtra main ipel maichon ke dauraan pani kii samasya ke jald sulajhane kii ummid jataai he
 Rajiv Shukla has said that potable water will not be used for the pitch and the water will not be wasted at all
 vahiin cricketer mahendra singh dhoni ne maharashtra main pani kii samasya par kaha ki match venue badalanaa iskaa hal nahin he
 When Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman say goodbye to Test cricket, at the moment there is no hope that someone will be able to compensate for their place well
 pehle suresh raina or ab viraat kohli ne bhartiya cricket premiyon ko niraash kiya
 Rohit Sharma may get a chance next week and will try to justify mistrust of new players
 in yuva khilaadiyon ko taiyaar hone ke liye paryaapt mauka diya gaya
 He played a lot of odis before wearing the test cap but still he is not able to perform well
 raina ne pehla test match khilne se pehle 98 ekadivasiy match khele
 He has played 15 Tests so far in which he is 29
 58 kii ausat se 710 ran hi bana paye hai
 Kohli got a chance to play Test after playing 59 odis but he was 21 in six matches
 27 kii ausat se 234 ran hi bana paye hai
 Rohit has also played 72 odis so far
 unki asafalataa kaa kaaran tej or oochaal vaali gendon par baikfoot par jaakar nahin khel paanaa rahaa he
 On the flat pitches of the subcontinent it is easy to hit the shot on the front foot
 videshi pichon par ghutane kii unchai se adhik kii oochaal hoti he or unke paas samaanaantar shaat khilne ke liye takneekee dakshata nahin he
 As a result, they are failing
 adhiktar visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki twanti-20 or ekadivasiy antarrashtriya maichon main lagaataar hiting karne se ve test cricket kii asli pariksha main khare nahin utar paa rahe hai
 Indian conditions are also not favorable for the development of batsmen
 ranjai trophy kii pichen nirjeev hoti he
 Apart from this, 80 percent of international cricket is played indigenously and many odis are being played
 iske saath hi ipel bhi khelaa ja rahaa he
 Whoever the coaches are, they do not tell the young players that they have to stop the balls playing defensively to improve their technique
 koi bhi jald se jald paisa jutanaa or naam kamanaa chahta he
 Former Indian batsman Sanjay Manjrekar said that when he tried to play air shots on the nets, he suffered a wrist injury
 coach bhi maanate hai ki bhartiya pichon par aise shaat khele ja sakate hai lekin oochaal vaali pichon par aisa sambhav nahin he
 Some former Indian batsmen also told how they were punished for playing the entire field by raising the bat head over playing the lofted shot, the current Australian captain and Michael Clarke, who scored a triple century in Sydney, are good examples
 clark ne kaha ki unhone ipel or twanti-20 big bash main khilne se inkaar isliye kiya kyonki vah acha ballebaaj bananaa chaahate the
 Clarke said that i Twenty
 20 ko chhodkar tathaa vanade or test maichon par dhyaan kendrit karke acha faisla kiya
 i think i improved my game and became the player i could possibly be

 bharat mata kii jai (manch par baithe netaaon ko sambodhan)
 
 
 And my brave sons and sisters of Bundelkhand, i am fortunate to have the privilege of visiting this heroic land today
 or jab bhi 1857 ke swatantraaa sangram kii baat aati he, to bundelkhand kaa paracham, jhaansi kaa paracham puure hindustan main nai oonchaaiyon ke darshan kar aata he
 This is a heroic land
 ye pragnavanon kii bhi bhoomi he
 And for which our present generation is proud, Hockey magician Dhyanchand was also born of this soil
 (bheed ne kiya chibers) us mitti ko main naman karata hum
 i have not come to you to cry crying
 na aansu bahaane aayaa hum
 i have not come to tell any story of those who shed tears
 main aaj aapke yahaan aayaa hum aapke aansu pochhne kaa vishwaas dene ke liye
 i have pledged to live in the difficulties of Bundelkhand, thrive in poverty, i have taken a pledge to wipe the tears of the poor here
 nadiyon or pani ke baavjood bundelkhand pyasakya yahaan kii janata main dam nahin he, yahaan ke kisaanon main dam nahin he
 If you do not have the strength 
 
 to lakhanu or dilli main nahin he
 (crowd noise) They don't care
 bhaaiyon bahanon
 i was coming by helicopter
 itani sari nadiyaan, itnaa pani, uske baad bhi bundelkhand pyaasa kyon he
 Why is the earth dry here? yahaan kaa kisaan aatmahatya karne ke liye majaboor kyon hota he
 Brothers and sisters, i ask the Sultanate of Delhi a direct question
 jawaab de
 What is the reason that wherever they have their feet, they have got the opportunity to rule
 wo chaahe andhra pradesh ho, chaahe maharashtra ho
 Even in that there is a dry area of vidarbha and whether there is a government supporting Congress here
 inhen sab rajyon main sabase zyada mere kisaan bhai bahan aatmahatya kyon karte hai
 Is this so in other states of India? na in logon ko gaanv kii parvaah he, na garib kii parvaah he, na kisaan kii parvaah he
 We distribute packages for our pockets
 When elections come, our Congress friends start distributing Revdis
 or aajkal jahaan jate hai, vahaan packet or package kii baaten karte hai
 Also came to you
 aapako laga hoga ki bhala karne aayaa tha
 No friends wo package aapkaa bhala karne nahin, wo to upi ke netaaon kaa munh band karne liye tukdaa phenkane ke liye bheja gaya tha
 Delhi and Lucknow jointly divided the package, did not come here
 koi mujhe bataae, yahaan mandi kaa nirmaan hone vaala tha
 Hua (the voice from the crowd is 'not done')
 There was talk of digging a well here
 najar aata he
 There was talk of making check dams on the rivers here
 kahin pani najar aata he
 So where did the money go? ye package unke pocket ke liye hota he
 Shivraj pieced the package of expenses and brothers and sisters, half of the package that Bundelkhand got, got to Bundelkhand in UP and half to Bundelkhand falling in MP
 or aaj main seenaa tanakar garv se kah saktaa hum ki meri party ke sipaahi aadarneey shivaraj singh ji chouhan, jab unke paas package aayaa, to pai pai bundelkhand kii bhalaai ke liye kharch hui
 As a result, more than 30 percent of the land has been completed to reach irrigation
 us ilaake main pehle jo fasal hoti thi
 Shivraj ji produced three times the crop from it
 aaj main ye bijepi ke netaa ke rup main nahin kah rahaa hum
 Planning Commission, headed by the Prime Minister of the country
 usne kaha ki is package kaa uttam upyog kisi ne kiya, to empi kii sarkaar ne, bijepi ne kiya or yahaan, yahaan sab lut liya
 Comes in your name
 jaataa inaki jeb main he
 And so brothers and sisters, now these package talks are enough
 ab vakt aa gaya he ki sapa-basapa-congress ko packing kar ravaanaa karo
 Ram Manohar Lohia will have to suffer from sp's exploits, which SP does here
 raamamanohar lohia jahaan bhi honge, unako itani pidaa hoti hogi, jisaki kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate
 They rob everyone
 samaajawaadee kaa sa, bahujan samaaj party kaa ba or congress kaa
 That means everyone
 ye teenon tikdi lutate hai
 They have destroyed UP, Bundelkhand
 maine bhi upi main daura kiya he
 When i used to work for the organization, i have gone to every district here
 yahaan ke logon ko janaa he samajha he
 Here the natural wealth is understood
 main vishwaas se kahata hum ki upi ke paas itnaa samarthy he ki upi akelaa apane balboote par puure hindustan kii garibi ko mitaa saktaa he
 This power is in UP
 lekin na unako vikaas karne main ruchi he, na yahaan ke naujavaanon kaa bhavishya banane main ruchi he
 Making them just the arithmetic of power
 gathjod kii raajnneeti karnaa, bhai se bhai ko ladaana, sabko baantate janaa, yahi inkaa kaarobaar he
 We will also change your fortune and change the picture of the country
 Brothers and sisters, if on the earth of UP, all the promises have been gathered here
 saare vaad yahaan ubhaar kar rakhe hai
 This is a land where there is egoism of Congress, familyism of Samajwadi Party and individualism of Bahujan Samaj Party, people full of promises do not want to fulfill their promises
 ve apana hi pet bharna chaahate hai
 And so brothers, sisters
 jab tak uttar pradesh in teenon prakaar ke sankaton se mukti kaa sankalp nahin karata, tab tak mere noujvaan mitron, aapkaa bhagya nahin badal saktaa
 Friends, today i have come to assure you based on my experience of governance
 pichley 12-13 saal main jo kaam karne kaa saubhaahgya mila, us kaam ko dekhte hue aapako vishwaas dilaane aayaa hum
 i tell the countrymen, i say from the land of Jhansi, remembering the virtue of Rani Laxmibai
 mere deshavaasiyon, aapane congress ko saath saal diya
 Give us only sixty months to see
 saath saal main unhone jo tabah kiya he
 As a BJP soldier, i assure you that if you give an opportunity even for sixty months, we will change your fate and change the fate of the country
 (modi-modi kaa shor
 
 
 Speech stops for a while) Gujarat is shining through the hard work of the people of UP and Bihar, brothers and sisters, you tell me
 mere noujvaan mitra mere sawaal kaa jawaab denge
 Will talk with your mind
 kya bundelkhand kaa koi noujvaan
 i want to leave my village, my home, and go to Mumbai's Gujarat slum
 (nahin kaa shor)apane boode maa baap ko chhodana chahta he, roji ke liye dar dar bhatakana chahta he (nahin kaa shor)bhaaiyon bahanon inhone aapako gaanv-parivaar chhodane ke liye majaboor kiya
 To fill the stomach
 maa baap kaa pet bharne ke liye noujvaan gujarat kii dharti par aakar pasinaa baha rahaa he
 Brothers, i say with pride that the people of up-bihar and Andhra have sweated so much that my Gujarat shines through their hard work
 agar yahi pasinaa yahaan baha hota to meraa uttar pradesh or bundelkhand kahaan se kahaan pahunch gaya hota
 i have done a new experiment
 hamane kuch kaarkaanedaaron ko bulaayaa
 Among these, the youth of Bihar in UP work as laborers
 ab wo aath ghanta kaam karte hai
 Then go away
 ek kamare main 25 log rahete hai
 i told them that you should calculate that if it works for eight hours six days a week
 jitna output detaa he
 Calculate it agar uskaa man karata he, do chaar ghante zyada kaam karne kaa
 And add it and based on that output its working hours should be decided
 hausala hoga to kaam karegaa, nahin karegaa, to nahin karegaa
 He considers himself the king and Shahzada, started the Mitra pilot project
 yahaan ke jo noujvaan hai, ve aath ke bajaay 12-13 ghante kaam karne lage, ek saal kaa kaam chah maheene main karne lag gaye
 i said that these young men have worked in six months
 unhen tankhwaah ke saath chah maheene kii chuttee do
 And then leave, when it is the farming season, the farm work has come out
 wo yahaan khet main kaam karegaa
 Will help the parents
 tankhwaah milegi
 Then go back and work
 ye payalat project safal ho gaya, to mere noujvaan upi kaa bhi bhala karenge or gujarat kaa bhi
 Why did this idea come? kyonki man kiya ki yahaan ke ladakon ko har tarah ke avasar milane chahie
 But Delhi does not even have time to think
 ab loksabhaa kaa chunaav aa gaya he
 Whether these people of Delhi should give account of their work or not
 ab kehete kya hai
 Those who are moving shared
 bhrashtachar par aapako kya kahana he, jawaab do
 Why not giving answers
 ye mahangaai, ye maataaon-bahanon par balaatkaar
 Not willing to answer aap mujhe bataaie ki ye chuni hui sarkaar, ye janata kii sevak he ki nahin
 Whether the public should answer or not
 ye apane aapako badshaah or shahjada maanate hai
 When the elections come, old wounds are crooked, i am listening shahjade ne jo bhaashan diya
 i want to raise serious questions
 unhone kaha ki jab meri daadi mar gai
 i got very angry
 main shahjade se poochna chahta hum ki kya ye sach he ki sabhi congressiyon ko gussa aayaa
 Is it true that you and your party people burnt thousands of Sikhs alive and not a single one has been punished till date
 kya aapako sirf daadi kaa maut kaa gussa aayaa
 Did you get angry at those who killed thousands of Sikhs? pidaa hui
 And today when elections have come in Delhi, you have committed the sin of sprinkling salt on that wound
 jin pariwaron ke naujavaanon ko jinda jala diya gaya or aaj aap daadi kii maut par aae gusse kii baat kar rahe ho
 No person who believes in humanity can forgive them
 kyon hindustan kii intelligence shahjade ko jaakar report karti haimain gambhir sawaal poochta hum
 After all, who is this Shahzade? ek empi hai
 Are the people of Intelligence of India
 bharat kii atyant gupt jaankaree us vyakti ke saath kaise share kar rahe hai, jisane guptata kii koi shapath nahin lee he
 The country wants to know and also ask those who dispute the hours for the Government of India every day
 koi bataae kyon hindustan kii intelligence shahjade ko jaakar report karti he
 Intelligence agency people give input for their political speeches
 unhone kaha ki mujffar nagar main iesai muslim naujavaanon ke sampark main he
 Shahzade belongs to the party of the country
 kya kaaran he ki iesai aapaki naak ke neeche upi main pair pasaarne kii takat rakhti he
 What are you doing
 desh jawaab maangata he
 You have put a serious charge on the people living in the relief camp that they have met the ISI
 shahjade sahab aapkaa jimmaa he
 Who are those young people, make their names public
 ve koun hai, jo iesai ke saath mili hai
 And if you do not declare the name, then it is your responsibility before any such accusation is made on any community
 or agar naam nahin he, to desh ke un naujavaanon se aap saarvajanik maafee maango
 This is your job dilli kii sarkaar lagata he news agency haiye dilli kii sarkaar
 It seems like he is a news agency
 jiskaa kaam sirf hamako khabar dena he
 That ISI is doing this
 are tumhaara kaam khabar dena he ki iesai ko thik karne kaa he
 Tell me, friends, can you trust such leaders
 ukhaad phenko
 It has seen destruction
 or isliye bhaaiyon bahanon, ye garibi kaa majaak uda rahe hai
 For them, poverty has become a tool of fun
 puraane jamaane main raja maharaajaaon ke bade bade mahal hua karte the
 time elapsed
 unka patan hua
 Wars were defeated
 samay rahete unke bade bade mahal nahin sanbhale to khandhar ho gaye
 His children's father and grandfather now take them to show the ruins
 bataate hai ki hamaare dada ke dada yahaan se raaj karte the
 Nowadays, these Shahzade also see the might of their ancestors
 hamaare pita ji ne kya kiya
 What did our grandmother do
 hamaare naanaa ji ne kya kiya
 The remains of his might go to the poor's hut
 ye unke purvajon ke parakram kaa parinaam he
 Came to your Bundelkhand
 rashan card bhi le gaye
 Not even returned yet
 aapako yaad he na
 And she is craving for poor ration card
 60 saal lag gaye, aadhi roti se puri roti tak pahunchane menshahjade naaraa lagavate hai
 People used to say that half of the bread will be eaten
 ab shahjade kehete hai ki puri roti bolo
 It took sixty years to reach half of the bread
 bhaiya
 You will spend another 100 years in your bread
 kya aap intjaar karnaa chaahate ho
 Making fun of the poor
 mitron aap bataaie kya 26 rupee main aapke parivaar kaa ek din kaa guzaar chal saktaa he
 Those living in the city can live for Rs 32
 kya itane main parivaar ke saath chaay bhi ho sakati he
 The planning commission chairman of the PM says that if you earn more than Rs 26, Rs 32, then you are not poor
 ye inaki maansik garibi dekhie
 These people cannot do good to the poor
 bhaaiyon bahanon garib kaise guzaara karata he, kis prakaar se apni jindagi gujaarta he, uskaa inhen pataa tak nahin he
 Congress, SP, BSP free India is the need of the day, Congress free, SP free and BSP free India
 desh ko luutane waalon ko jab tak aap vidaai nahin denge
 You will not be well bhaaiyon bahanon, isi dharti se 1857 main ek naaraa gunja tha
 The slogan was given by Veerangana Lakshmi Bai by sitting her child on her back
 meri jhaansi nahin duungi
 Where was it? mitron 1857 kaa sangram, roti or camel, ek kranti ke pratik bane the
 Brothers and sisters, this battle brought bread and lotus and woke up Bundelkhand
 aaj ham ek baar phir lakshmi bai kii dharti par camel lekar aae hai
 Friends, and where does Laxmi reside
 camel par hi virajit hoti he
 If there is a lotus, then Lakshmi will come
 or lakshmi aegi to roti aana pakkaa he doston, ye kranti lani he
 Friends, Lakshmi Bai had said that she will not give me, she will not give me Jhansi
 mitron mere saath naaraa bulaayenge
 Will call you with full force
 mitron main kahuunga
 Just understand the slogan
 ye bundelkhand kii dharti kii aawaaj he
 Friends Rani Laxmibai said, i will not give, will not give, will not give my Jhansi
 mitron main kahata hum
 Will not give to dishonest people
 aap kahie meraa desh nahin denge
 
 
 Noise of slogans
 
 
 do baar bolie
 
 
 Noise and bullies, we will not give these countries to the dishonest
 bhaaiyon bahanon lut chali he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party gave birth to a normal person like me, born in a backward family, a tea seller in a railway compartment
 ye party kii mahanata dekhie
 See these rites of BJP
 aise pichde parivaar ke vyakti ko desh ke piem kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya
 Brothers and sisters, don't make me prime minister
 aap mujhe chaukeedaar banaae
 And brothers and sisters, i will go to Delhi and sit like a watchman
 aapako vishwaas dilaataa hum
 You will make such a watchman, i will not let any pawn fall on the vault of the country
 isliye main chaukeedaar kii tarah seva karnaa chahta hum
 You gave them sixty years
 mujhe saath maheene dijie
 We will change the fate as well as the picture
 puri takat se bolie
 Long live Mother India
 takat se bolie
 These media people want to take your picture
 raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar congress main gahamagahami machi hui he
 In such a situation, Congress President Sonia Gandhi has said that time is still left in the presidential election and the candidates should be patient
 isse pehle aaj pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne bhi sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi
 Mamta Banerjee assured that she would support the nominee for the presidency by the UPA
 sonia ke awaas par mulaakaat ke baad baahar aate vakt trinmul congress pramukh ne baithak ke bare main zyada jaankaree dene se inkaar kar diya
 Heartfelt gratitude to the people of Rajasthan for trusting the Congress party
 congress ke kaaryakartaaon or netaaon ko unke sangharsh ke safal hone par hardik badhai| Serving Rajasthan is a matter of pride for the Congress party
 We will fully discharge our responsibility

 It's my birthday and I'm the guest!a post shared by Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) on Nov 2, 2019 at 11:03am pdtsaharuka khan (shah Rukh Khan) ke is jawaab par phans bhi khub riect kar rahe hai
 Let me tell you, Shah Rukh Khan, the king of Bollywood, celebrated his birthday on 2 November, on this occasion his fans in the country and abroad greeted him
 burj khalipha (burj Khalifa) main is din roshni se likhaa gaya, "bollywood ke king shahrukh khan ko janmdin mubarak", isi ke saath ek shandaar fountain sho bhi hua jiske becoground main shahrukh kii film 'om shanti om' kaa gaanaa 'dhooma taana taana' baj rahaa tha
 Shahrukh, the brand ambassador of Dubai Tourism, shared this video clip on his Instagram
 dilli main dukaanon kii ceiling kaa maamla garmaataa ja rahaa he
 Aam Aadmi Party mlas wrote a letter to LG Anil Baijal to stop the ceiling, in response to which the LG office has sent advice to the AAP MLA
 somvaar kii dopaher 3 baje aam aadmi party ke kai vidhayakaseeling ke mudde paraelji se bina vakt liye mulaakaat karne pahunch gaye
 a heavy police force was deployed around the LG office with barricades
 police ne 'aap' vidhayakon ko bataaya ki alji beating retreat kaarykram main shaamil hone gaye hai, jiske baad tamaam vidhayak alji daftar ke najadik dharne par baith gaye
 These AAP mlas sitting on the dharna were also included in the list of eligible and recently disqualified mlas
 iname saurabh bharadwaj, amanatullah khan, sanjeev jha, bandana kumari, commando surendra, jagadeep singh, pramila tokes, jitendra tomars, vishesh ravi, hajaari laal chouhan, sahi ram, ruturaj jha, sridatt sharma or raakhi birlan dharne par ye kehete hue baith gaye ki jabatak alji sahab mulaakaat nahin kar lete, wo yun hi unka intjaar karte rahenge
 'the solution to the sealing issue is being searched' Meanwhile, the Lieutenant Governor responded by writing a letter to Aam Admi Party spokesperson and MLA from Greater Kailash, Saurabh Bhardwaj
 alji ne apane patr main kaha he ki unhone ceiling se jude pahaluon ko samajhane ke liye dukandaaron or vyapaariyon ke pratinidhiyon ke saath kai baithken kii thi
 LG said that keeping in mind all judicial orders and existing laws on the issue of sealing, possible solutions are being explored

 This time there will be no fraud in casting votes in the capital Delhi elections
 kyonki voter list main kisi kaa naam or us naam par kisi or ke vot ke khel par is baar dilli ke chunaav karyaalay ne lagaam kas di he
 The Election Commission has gone door-to-door in the entire Delhi to get the names of those people who have not been found at the address

 The Election Commission has clearly stated that the entire process has been completed before removing these names

 The surprising thing is that more than 32 thousand fake voters were found in Chief Minister Sheila Dixit's assembly constituency New Delhi and more than 27 thousand voters in the area of opposition Leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra were missing
 vaise chunaav karyaalay saaf kah rahaa he ki aisa nahin he ki naam sirf kate hai balki lakhon naam jode bhi gaye hai
 According to the Chief Electoral Officer of Delhi, it had two aspects
 ek to jinka naam nahin hona chahie unhen nikaalnaa to saath hi jinka hona chahie unhen jodna bhi
 Eighty and a half lakh new names have been added in 2012, so this year nearly 4 lakh new names have been added

 Later, he accused the teachers associated with the complaining organization

 During the hearing, counsel for Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Rehabilitation Committee, PN Mishra, quoted the hadith, referring to the rules for the purchase and use of land through Islamic law
 unhone hazarat mohammad sahab, unke anuyaayiyon hazrat umr, said bukhari or yahudiyon ke bich hue vaakyon kaa bayaan kiya
 He said that there are many rules and basic things for the mosque
 masjid kii jameen or imaarat kii sharten, vakf karne vaala zamin kaa vaazib maalik hona chahie, azaan kii jagah, vajookhaana zaruri he
 Have Azan and Namaz at least twice daily
 vazu ke liye pani kaa strot ho
 There should not be pictures of bells, creatures, or idols in the mosque
 jis bhukhand par masjid ho vahaan kisi duusare dharm kaa upasna sthal naa ho
 There should be no accommodation in the mosque, a place to cook, ie the stove, etc
 pien mishra ne kaha ki vivaadit sthal par sita rasoi kaa hone kaa bhi pramaan he
 There should not be tombs
 jiske peeche namaaz adaa kerani pade
 People of any other religion cannot take charge of the maintenance of the mosque
 ramalala devtaa hai
 Devotees have been coming
 islam ke mutabik naa to wo masjid he or vahaan namaaz nahin ho sakati
 PN Mishra said, 'babur's descendants may own a building but that building cannot be a mosque
 hindu sadiyon se vahaan puja karte rahe lekin musalamaanon kaa akele kabja kabhi nahin rahaa
 That building was in our possession
 musalmaan shaasha hone kii vajah se jabaran vahaan namaaz adaa karte the
 Before 1856 there were no prayers
 1934 tak vahaan sirf jume kii namaaz hoti rahi'
 This Justice Chandrachud asked- Can any ruler build a mosque on the land owned by the government or his private property? To this, PN Mishra replied that such incidents happened in the Mughal era too
 lekin badshaah ko kaazi ne jawaab diya tha ki apni kamai se kharidi zamin par masjid banane ke baad uske mentanence kaa bhi intazaam karnaa banane vaale kii zimmedaari he
 Masjid Al Haram, Al Aqsa and Masjid Nabvi are not inclined towards the Kaaba
 iske alaava duniya bhar kii sabhi masjidon kii diwaar kaaba kii ore he yani namaazi kaa sajadaa kaa rukh kaaba kii ore rahata he
 PN Mishra said that last prayers were held there on 16 December 1949
 iske baad hi dange hue or prashasan ne namaaz band kara di
 During 1934 to 1949, the key of the building containing the mosque used to be near the Muslims but the police used to open the prayer for the prayer of Zuma and after the cleaning, then the prayer but after this, the Bairagi and the monks used to make noises and disrupt the prayers which increased the tension 
 22-23 disambar kii raat juma ke liye namaaz kii taiyaari to hui lekin namaaz nahin ho pai
 When the arguments of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Revival Committee advocate PM Mishra were completed, Harishankar Jain started a debate on behalf of Hindu Mahabha
 unhone kaha ki yah jagah shuru se hiduon ke adhikaar main rahi
 Why should our rights remain limited even after independence? Because from 1528 to 1885, anywhere and anytime Muslims had no claim here
 martin ne bukanan ke research ko aage badhaate hue usee hawaale se 1838 main is jagah kaa zikr kiya he
 Hindu puja parikrama was done in that book too
 tab kisi masjid kaa zikr nahin tha
 Trafan Thaler has not even mentioned any mosque
 hairat he ki tab ke muslim itihaaskaaron ne bhi masjid kaa zikr nahin kiya
 Harishankar Jain argued, 'hindus continued to worship from 1855 to 1950 but the British limited the right of worship
 azaadi milane or samvidhan lagu hone ke baad bhi jab anuchhed 25 lagu hua phir bhi hame puja upasna kaa puraa adhikaar nahin mila'
 Citing Article 13, Jain said that since we had possession before independence, it should remain intact
 aakrantaon ne hamaare dharmasthal nasht kiye lutpaat kii
 According to Islam, this loot was a reward for their goods
 jain ne quran ke sura : 8 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki dharm kii aad main yuddh se mila maal senapati ko miltaa tha or wo sabko baantate the
 Jain said that once the temple is built, it remains a temple for all time

 It is established that Babur broke the temple and gave it the shape of a mosque
 samvidhan kii mul prati main tisare chapter main bhi ram kii tasviir he
 Ram is also a constitutional man
 jain ne kaha ki ram ayodhya main mahal main paidaa hue the
 Justice Chandrachud said that it is a matter of faith
 jain ne kaha ki vishwaas nahin yahi sahi he kyonki sabhi granth yahi kehete hai
 Varinder Kumar Sharma, the second counsel of the Hindu Mahasabha, said how the decision which was not in the petition was decided? After this the argument was started by the Shia Board
 emasi dhingra ne kaha ki 1936 main shiya, sunni vakf board banane kii baat tay hui or donon kii vakf sampattiyon kii suchi banaai jane lagi
 In 1944, the board issued a notification
 wo masjid shiya vakf kii sampatti thi
 Our Mutavalli was Shia but mistakenly placed Imam Sunni
 ham isi vajah se mukadmaa haare
 The records state that Mutavalli was a Jaki Shia in 1949
 court ne kaha ki aap hindu paksh kaa virodh nahin kar rahe hai naa, bas itnaa hi kaaphi he
 The CJI said that your appeal in the High Court was dismissed in 1946 and you came to the Supreme Court in 2017 with SLP
 itani deree kyon? is par shiya board ne kaha ki markat machi thi
 Our documents and records were also with the Sunnis
