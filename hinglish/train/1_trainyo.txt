wo bhi ek pub main
 Now, what happens in that party, you will guess the theme of this party
 party kaa theme tha-sex and smoke
 Buzz Buzz Inn, the famous pub in the city center of Gurgaon
 pub ke andar skool ke ladke-ladakiyon kii toli or karant numbers par thirakate unke kadam
 Away from the rules, inside the boundary wall, the smoke of the hookah, the spilling jam and dissolved in the air, in the minor hands
 sex and smoke kii theme par par dhire-dhire javaan hoti raat or phir party ke baad masti kaa puraa intjaam
 But before this party was completely young, the police entered it
 ab pub main music or masti kii jagah khamoshi thi
 The trembling steps had stopped until some time ago
 party main jo, jahaan or jis haal main tha
 He got the order to stop there and then all the party goers present here had fun in one stroke
 dhuen ke chhallon ke saath kanoon kii dhajjiyaan udaane waalon par kanoon baari padane laga
 Then on seeing the police sealed the pub
 lekin band kamare ke andar ho rahi party kii tasviren aam hone par badanaami kaa khatara kam na tha
 So, as it became, he started hiding his face
 khaas baat ye thi ki is party main bade kam or bachche yani naaballig ladke-ladkiyaan zyada the
 So instead of arresting them, the police decided to call their family members
 lekin iske baad jo kuch hua uski ummid shaayad kisi ko nahin thi
 First the scolding, then the shocks and then the round of slaps and slings started
 darasal, police kii shikaayat par yahaan pahunche in ladke-ladakiyon ke gharavaalon ne jab apane bacchon ko is haal main dekha, to unamem se zyaadaatar apane gusse par kaabo nahin rakh sake
 Now it was the turn to call the party organizers
 jab poochtacha hui, to ek or chaunkaanewaali baat pataa chali
 It was clear that these parties had fixed themselves on a social networking site in the name of Sex and Smoke
 or kaayade-kanoonon ko dhuen main udaane kii jagah mili, isi bazz in pub main
 Party sex and smoke and all the school children partying
 khud gudgaanv police ke liye bhi aisi party kaa gavaah bananaa ek nai baat thi
 Therefore, instead of sending these school children to jail, the police decided to call their family members at the same place
 faisla acha tha
 But what happened after that, the police themselves did not even think about it
 gudgaanv ke is pub main mujeec or masti to roj kii baat he
 But after the sudden arrival of police here on Sunday afternoon, the story of it came to the attention of not only the nearby people, but the entire Delhi NCR
 kyonki is roj is pub main chal rahi party koi maamuli party nahin thi
 This party was rather sex and smoke
 angrezi ke in do lafjon kaa sidhe-sidhe anuwaad karen to matlab nikalataa he, yon sambandh or dhuen kaa
 And look at the fact that the people doing these sex and smoke parties were not adults and sensible, but the school children who came out of the house on the pretext of education, but reached this pub, in search of that fun Which was probably impossible for his family members to even think about
 bhari dopaher ko chal rahi is party main shaamil naaballig ladke-ladkiyaan naa sirf betkalluphi se hukke ke dhuen kaa challa bana rahe the, balki duniyaadaari or kaayade-kanoonon se bephikr sharaab pine-pilaane kaa daur bhi puure shabaab par tha
 The special thing was that the number of girls in this party, kept on the theme of sex and smoke, was not less
 yani ye party sirf is pub tak simit nahin thi, balki pub main drinks or dance ke baad party main shaamil ladke-ladkiyaan apane-apane partner ke saath apane-apane thikaane par jane ke liye aaazaad the
 But before this theme of sex and smoke could be completed, the police entry into the party was done
 qaayade-kaanoonon ko thenga dikhaa kar chal rahi is party kii khabar milte hi gudgaanv police or exise department ne is pub par ek joint red kii or phir kanoon ke in muhaafijon ko andar jo kuch dikhaa, use dekhakar sabhi sakate main aa gaye
 Hundreds of schoolboys and girls were not only enjoying hookah and liquor at the party, but there were also many people who did not have their own senses due to the addiction
 aise main police ne pehle to sabhi ladakon ko neeche hi dance floor par baithne ko kaha or phir kisi ke bhi baahar jane par roak laga di
 Now in view of the exaggeration of the case, the police informed their family members in exchange for filing a case against boys and girls in this regard
 police to khayr pehle hi hairaan ho chuki thi
 But now it was the turn of the family to be shocked
 phir jab abhibhavakon ne skool, college or tution kii baat kahkar ghar se nikle apane bacchon ko is tarah dhokhe se maje karte hue dekha to ve apana gussa kaabo main nahin rakh sake
 Then started washing her children on the spot
 ek soshal netwarking cites ke jariye khud in schuli students kii ore se rakhi gai is party par hui chhapemari se beshak is baar bhed khul gaya, lekin ye chhapemari har us parivaar ke liye ek sabak jarur he jo is badalte daur main apane bacchon kii parvarish or aazaadee ke masale par laaparvaahee baratate hai
 In a posh residential area of gurgaon, a schoolboy created a sex and smoke group on the social networking site on July 12 at 10:30 pm
 jaisaa ki naam se hi saaf tha ki is group ko creat karne kaa makasad ek aisi party kaa aayojan karnaa tha, jisamen dhuen or nashe kii masti ke saath-saath har tarah ke sambandhon kii khuli chhot ho
 And then upon seeing this group, not one, but hundreds of people liked it
 lekin khaas baat ye thi ki ise like karne waalon main zyaadaatar 16 se 18 saal ke umr ke ve ladke or ladkiyaan the, jo yaa to skulon main pard rahe the yaa phir jinhone abhi-abhi collejon main daakhila liya tha
 But like every party, some terms and conditions for sex and smoke were already in place
 in sharton main 600 rupee kii fees, apane partner ko saath laane, khud apane liye kisi khaas brands kii sharaab lekar aane, party main kisi jaankaar ke reference se hi aane or isaki sikresi mentin karne yani party ko gupt rakhane kii baat kahi gai thi
 But watch it amazing that not only girls like boys took full interest in this party, but it was also clear in the inquiry that most of the girls had reached the pub long before the scheduled time to join this party
 
 pub main naaballigon ko sharaab parose jane ke masale par jab police ne party kaa aayojan karanevaale ladke se poocha, to uskaa kahana tha ki party main sharaab pi rahe ladke apane saath khud hi sharaab kii bottle lekar pahunche the
 But despite all this, the way the pub owner and manager gave the children permission to openly break the law in the matter of earning, it certainly raises the question that in the end, in the middle of the city- How can anyone be so foolish with the police and the excise department? How was a drunk and sex party going on in this pub in Gurgaon by defrauding all the laws and regulations? That too, when alcohol is served to minors, it is forbidden to run hookah bars in Gurgaon
 police ne jab is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane kii koshish kii, to uske haath apane-aap pub ke maalik or manager kii girebaan tak pahunch gaye
 Everyone's eyes have been astonished by this shameful Sunday party of the ninths in this pub of DB City Center Mall
 sawaal uth rahaa he ki aakhir 15 se 20 saal ke 100 se zyaada in bacchon ko sharaab kaise paros di gai
 Did the owner and manager of the pub not know that it is illegal for anyone under the age of 25 to drink alcohol
 or agar jaankaree thi to bacchon ko pub main sharaab va hukke kii party karne kii ijaajat kyon di gai
 The Excise Department, alarmed by this incident, has issued a challan against the operators of the pub
 philhal pub maalik or manager ke khilaaf dlef thane main maamla darj kiya gaya he or police ne is pub kii site ko bhi band karvaa diya he
 If this party is noticed then now there is a ruckus
 lekin is pub main pichley ek maheene se har ravivaar ko aisi hi sande party ho rahi thi
 Probably no one was aware of
 jaraa sochie, desh ke kitne hi hisson main aise hi belgaum pabon kii vajah se kahin hamaara aane vaala kal sharaab or dhuen ke ghobaar main to nahin kho rahaa

 ham ek aise insaan par film bana rahe hai jiskaa naam arun gavali he jisaki jindagi main tufaan aae or kaise unhone un kathinaaon ke bich se rasta banaaya

 How are you able to give so much respect to that gangster? There were 120 murder cases on which many of them are acquitted and in the rest of the cases in which they are being accused, they say that they have not done them
 
 baaki mujhe sach nahin pataa ki kya sach he kya nahin lekin record main hai to kuch hua hoga

 Ajinkya Rahane hit hundreds on the first day of the Lord's Test match and brought Team India to a respectable position
 rahane kii is pari kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah thi ki unhone ek baar phir puchhlle ballebaajon ke saath milakar yah behtareen kamaal kiya
 Team India's score was 7 wickets for only 145 runs in this match, India was in danger of being allotted at a very low score but Rahane changed the stand of the match with Bhubaneswar and Mohammad Sami
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab rahane ne yah kamaal kiya he, isse pehle 2013-14 ke south africa daure par unhone durban test kii pehali or duusari pari main kramshah naabad 51 or 96 ran kaa yogadan diya tha
 The circumstances were also similar in this match
 vah lade par apni team ko match jitaane main kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 After this, Rahane batted something similar in the second Test match of the New Zealand tour
 ve jab ballebaaji karne aae to us vakt bharat kaa score tha 5 wicket par 165 ran
 By the time he was out, the team had scored 423 for 9 wickets
 is dauraan ne unhone kohli, dhoni, jadeja or jahir khan ke saath milakar team india ko majboot sthiti main pahunchaaya
 However, this test match was also drawn
 is match main rahane ne apane test kariyar kaa pehla shatak jadaa
 He scored an outstanding innings of 118 runs
 ab sawaal uthta he ki aisa kya khaas he is khilaadi main jiske boote har pari ke saath uski ballebaaji or nikhar rahi he
 He finally learned where to bat with tail batsmen
 kyonki rahane swabhaavik taur par top order ballebaaj hai
 Then coming at number 5 or 6, with the tail batsmen to take the team ahead, where did this style learn? Rahane says that he has learned this art by watching and talking to the batsmen who play well with the tail batsmen
 rahane kehete hai, 'maine puchhlle ballebaajon ke saath batting karne ke bare main durban test main siikhaa
 When i was dismissed for 96 in the second innings of the Durban Test, then i had a century on my mind
 ise paane kii koshish main wicket ganvaa diya
 But now i realize that when you are batting with the tail, trust them
 yahi maine vallington main kiya or phir ise lords main doharaaya
 "rahane says," It is challenging to bat with the tail

 After the first round of voting in Gujarat, the exercise to create political wind for the second phase is now in the final phase
 bijepi-congress donon ne iske liye puri takat jhonk di he
 The BJP has played the Pakistan card to create an atmosphere against the Congress
 uske star prachaarak narendra modi khud chunavi sabhaaon main isaki aguwai kar rahe hai
 The special thing is that in Bihar and even Delhi elections, this Pakistan card of BJP has failed
 lekin siyaasi halaat aise hai ki bijepi ne ek baar phir isi card par daanv khelaa he
 Modi played Pakistan card Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday in an election campaign in Palanpur, Banaskantha, alleged that senior Congress leaders were taking help from across the border for the Gujarat elections
 modi ne congress par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki pakistani sena ke purv diarector general sardaar arshad rafeeki congress netaa ahamed patel ko gujarat kaa mukhyamantri bananaa chaahate hai
 He said that on one hand the former DG of Pakistan Army is interfering in the elections of Gujarat, while the people of Pakistan are also meeting at the house of Mani Shankar Aiyar

 dilli chunaav main kejariwal ko kaha tha-ak49dilli vidhansabha chunaavon ke bich pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ko pakistan kaa agent bataaya tha
 At a BJP rally in Hiranagar area of kathua in Jammu and Kashmir, PM Modi said that three aks have emerged as three forces of Pakistan
 pehla e ke 47 he jiskaa istemaal kashmir main khoonkhrabe ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The second is AK Antony, who tells Parliament that people dressed as Pak soldiers beheaded our soldiers, while our army says that Pakistanis came and the third is AK 49, who has just set up a new party

 Do you want firecrackers to burn in Pakistan? The then Union Minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy posted a screenshot of Pakistan's newspaper Dawn's website and an advertisement of Nitish Kumar on Twitter appealing for votes
 rudi ne twitor par likhaa, ''bihar main matadaataaon ko lubhaane ke liye pakistan ke dainik don ke i sanskaran main nitish kaa vigyaapan

 He used to blame the then President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf for this and used to call Musharraf as Mian Musharraf, in a gesture, targeting the Muslim population of the state
 modi kaa ye card paas hoga yaa failpiem modi ke bhaashanon se saaf dikh rahaa he ki rajya main bijepi kii raah pehle jaisi nahin najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, on the pretext of PM Modi and his party Pakistan and Ahmed Patel are also hoping for polarization of votes
 gujarat ke ran main bijepi kaa ye pakistan card kitna safal hota he, ye 18 disambar ko hi saaf hoga
 When the results of the election results started showing clear signs of the bjp's overwhelming victory, then only the BJP President Amit Shah's eyes were fixed on the next victory
 unhone haryana ke prabharee party mahasachiv anil jain se aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaariyon kaa byora taiyaar rakhane ko kaha
 In fact, Shah's mission has been completed in 50 per cent of the vote in India
 so, shah or bhaajapa ke netaaon ko yah bakhubi ehsaas he ki is chunaav main party ne jin rajyon main 50 fisadi ke aasapaas vot hasil kiye hai, vahaan jeet kaa silsilaa bhale dhimaa pad jaae (yani kuch kam siton ke saath bahumat hasil ho) magar thamega nahin
 According to party sources, Shah's goal was to have assembly elections in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand this year, so at least 50 per cent of the votes must be obtained to lay the foundation for the next victory
 beshak, isamen ve safal bhi hue
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, BJP has got around 50 per cent votes in 17 out of 35 states (including union territories)
 yah aankada party 15 rajyon main apane dam par to bihar or maharashtra (kramash: 52 or 50 pratishat) main apane sahyogiyon ke saath hasil karne main safal hui he
 The party single-handedly won 61 in Uttarakhand, 49 in Uttar Pradesh
 6, tripura main 49
 1, 58 in Rajasthan
 5, dilli main 56
 6, 58 in Madhya Pradesh, 51 in Karnataka
 9, jharkhand main 51, himachal main 69, haryana main 58, gujarat main 62, goa main 51, chhattisgarh main 50
 7, 50 in Chandigarh
 64, or arunachal main 58 fisad vot mili hai
 BJP has got 257 seats and its allies 45 seats from these 17 states
 bhaajapa pravaktaa or rajyasabha saansad jiviel narsingh raav kehete hai, ''na sirf is saal balki agle teen saal tak jahaan bhi vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai, vahaan party ko prachand bahumat milegaa
 It is certain that very soon the vote share of BJP in the entire country will be 50 percent
 '' agle saal (2020) pramukh rajya bihar or dilli main chunaav hone hai
 West Bengal in 2021 and then Uttar Pradesh in 2022 are the major states where assembly elections are due
 in rajyon main sirf bengal (40
 3 per cent) except the bjp's vote share is around 50 per cent
 haalanki kai vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki har chunaav ke apane sameekaran or mudde hote hai isliye jaruri nahin ki maujuuda vot pratishat aage bhi barkaraar rahe
 An example of this is the Delhi Assembly elections held within a year of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when the bjp's vote percentage fell from 46 to 33
 to, maujuuda maamle main itane bade vot share ko barkaraar rakhane kii bhaajapa netaaon kii ummid kii vajah kya he?bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kii daleel he, ''party ke liye yah kathin isliye nahin he kyonki modi sarkaar kalyankari yojanaon kaa laabh logon tak sahi tareeke se pahunchaa rahi he or party sanghathan bhi lagaataar logon ke sampark main he
 The party will definitely get more than 50 percent of the votes in the upcoming assembly elections
 ''bhaajapa media cell ke pramukh anil baluni kehete hai, ''bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne 50 fisad vot kaa jo lakshya tay kiya tha, vah desh ke zyaadaatar rajyon main hasil ho gaya he
 Soon we will achieve this goal in other states as well
 '' bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki bhaajapa kaa vot pratishat badhaane kaa abhiyaan yahi nahin thamata

 The point is, does anyone even care? Technicians silently contribute to Bollywood cinema
 ve ghanton tak kaam karte hai kyonki unhen cinema pasand he lekin kya unhen iskaa credit miltaa bhi he?'nimish ne bollywood main salmaan khan kii film res 3 se apane kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 He worked for films like Race 3, Housefull 4, Bypass Road, Marjawan etc

 After all, it is the same country that even after 66 years of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, does not forget to ask why Bapu did not get Nobel? This country gets a little comfort with the Nobel Prizes awarded to Amatriya Sen and Mother Teresa, but Sen lives outside India and Mother was born outside India, which means that she is left with nothing
 aise main achaanak ek 60 saal kaa safed dadhi vaala shaks nobel loriet banakar ubharta he
 Within minutes of the news spreading, the official website of the Bachpan Bachao Andolan crashed, as people from every corner of the world wanted to know who is Satyarthi and what he has done, which is known by Pakistan's famous child rights activist Malala Yousafzai Along with him, he is being given the world's biggest award
 ghoshnaa ke kuch der baad satyaarthee nai dilli ke apane karyaalay ke baahar aae or vahaan intjaar kar rahe samvaadadaataaon se mili
 Satyarthi thanked the Nobel Committee that he has understood the problems of millions of children in today's times
 unhone kaha, “yah mere liye bahut bada sammaan he
 "he is the second Indian to receive the Nobel Prize for Peace
 isse pehle madar terresa ko 1979 main yah sammaan mila tha
 But the Gandhian Satyarthi still has a grudge
 agar yah puraskaar rashtrapita mahatma gandhi ko mila hota to ve zyada khush hote
 He says, "I was born after the death of Mahatma Gandhi
 agar yah puraskaar mujhase pehle mahatma gandhi ko mila hota to main or bhi zyada sammanit mahasoos karata
 It is an honor for all citizens of the country
 ”philhal, satyaarthee ko yah santosh he ki nobel puraskaar kii vajah se bal mazdooree or trephiking kaa mudda antarrashtriya str par charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya he
 But she has also realized that this international honor has increased her responsibilities, "the award has increased the responsibility of working for the welfare of children
" yah bharat samet duusare deshon main bada mudda he
 Satyarthi's first response since the founding of 80,000 bonded child laborers since the establishment of the BBA in 1980 was, "this award is dedicated to my countrymen and millions of children whose voices have never been heard in this country before
" ” jab satyaarthee yah baat kar rahe the tab tak unka naam twitor par pehali baar trend karne laga or duniyabar ke nami-giraami log unhen badhaaiyaan dene lage
 Dinanath Chauhan, a researcher of the missing child branch of the Delhi Child Rights Commission and a long-time BBA who works, remembers Satyarthi, “things are very clear in his mind
 koi plan tay karne ke baad usamen badlaav karte hue maine unhen bahut kam dekha he
 Chauhan says that in the 34-year history of the BBA, the Nobel Prize has been received today, but before that Satyarthi had to eat sticks
 satyaarthee ke bare main mana jaataa he ki ve pehle aise shaks hai jisane bal mazdooree yaa bandhua mazdooree ke mudde ko saamaajik kshetra main lokapriy banaaya
 Better coordination with the administration and the BBA network to track child labor incidents across the country became his biggest strength
 dilli kii kitni hi factoriyon main bibie kii pahal par police ne chaape maare or hajaaron bacchon ko daastaa kii bedi se mukt karaayaa
 Swami Agnivesh, who once led Satyarthi in the fight against child labor, also believes that Satyarthi did this work whole-heartedly
 jab puraskaar kii ghoshnaa hui tab train se dilli se chhapra ja rahe swami agnivesh ne kaha, “yah desh kaa sammaan he
 i am very happy ” yah baat kisi se chhipi nahin he ki gahare matbhedon ke kaaran donon ne varshon pehle apni raahen alag kar lee thim
 By the way, this social worker born in 1954 in Vidisha district of Madhya Pradesh has received many big awards earlier
 isamen dephanders of demokrasi award (america 2009), alphonso comin international award (spain 2008), medal of da italian seenet (italy 2007) or robert epa kennedy international human ritis award (america) shaamil hai
 That is why his critics are no less
 unke aalochak aksar kaha karte the ki ve magsese puraskaar ke chakkar main lage rahete hai
 But after getting the Nobel, critics see the need for introspection

 hamen asal aantarik samasya ko khatm karnaa hoga
 He said that there is a need to sit down and talk about the problem
 unhone saath hi kaha tha ki agar mere istipha dene se samasya hal ho sakati he to main iske liye taiyaar hum

 According to TRAI data, between 2004 and 2007, the industry's average operating profit margin (EBIDTA margin, ie interest, tax, depreciation and earnings before repayment of debt) increased from 30 per cent to 42 per cent
 is dauraan byaaj bhugtan or tex se pehle kaa munafa (pibiity) 16 fisadi se badhkar 29 fisadi tak or lagaai gai puunji par ritern kii dar (aarosie) 10 fisadi se badhkar 28 fisadi tak pahunch gai
 One key to success in this era was that competition was limited to only four to five companies in each circle
 haalanki yah 2002 ke pehle ke daur se bahut zyada thi
 Because of this, there was a healthy competition and companies also made good profits
 jab 2007 main raja ne doorsanchaar mantri kaa padbhaar sambhala, uske baad se hi paridrishy puri tarah se badal gaya
 His decision to award 122 new licenses at a much lower price in 2008 increased the number of telecom operators to 13 from five in each circle
 is baari pratispardhaa se agle paanch varsh main graahakon kii sankhya main baari teji ai (16
 5 crores to 80 crores above) and average tariffs (call rates) also declined sharply
 lekin isse samooche telecom sector ke vittiya rup se tike rahane kii kshamta par baari chot hui
 Between 2007 and 2011, the EBIDTA margin of the sector fell from 42 per cent to just 34 per cent, according to TRAI data
 isi prakaar pibiity margin bhi 29 fisadi se girakar 16 fisadi par pahunch gaya or puunji par ritern 28 fisadi se ghatakar 18 fisadi tak rah gaya
 The effective result was that whatever gains were made between 2004 and 2007 disappeared completely
 yah sab is vajah se hua kyonki atishay pratispardhaa se is udyog kii vittiya sthiti par chot padi
 This does not include the indirect damage done to the sector due to the uncertainty created by aspects of the scandal in Raja's decisions
 2008 se 2012 ke bich munafa to sikud hi gaya, telecom companiyon ko baari karj bhi lenaa padaa
 This burden increased greatly when the government auctioned 3G spectrum in 2010
 keemtee spectrum ke liye telecom udyog ko sarkari khajaane main ek lakh karod ru
 Due to this, companies were burdened with heavy debt
 telecom companiyon ke liye durbhaagya kii baat yah rahi ki 3ji ke upabhokta us gati se nahin bad paae jaise ki vaayas kol sevaaon ke liye bade the
 "telecom services, including SMS, account for less than 20 percent of telecom companies' earnings," says independent telecom analyst Ravi Visvesaraya Prasad
 ” prasad ke mutabik, bhartiya bazaar abhi vailu adid sevaaon ke liye taiyaar nahin hua he
 It is clear that ambitious telecom companies have invested too much money in a service in which they do not seem to get any special returns in the near future
 cellular operators association of india (jiesem oparator ke sanghathan) ke mahanideshak rajan maithyuj sweekaar karte hai ki telecom companiyon se galati hui he
 Despite all this, telecom companies were expecting good financial results in 2012-13 and 2013-14, but TRAI chief J
 es
 Sarma deflated his expectations with his recommendations for the sector in April 2012
 us samay sarama ko sirf 122 nirast 2ji license ke liye nae sir se nilaamee kaa khaakaa sujhane kii jimmedaari hi saunpi gai thi
 Logically TRI has 26 in the 1800 mhz band (which were revoked with the license)
 6 megahterj spectrum kii phir se nilaamee ke liye sifarish kerani thi
 But instead he recommended a re-auction of only 5 mhz
 sarama ne spectrum kii kritrim rup se kami paidaa kii or rigerv keemat ko badhaakar 18,000 karod ru
 Tax, which was later earmarked by EGOM for Rs 14,000 crore
 kar diya
 Sarma had a reason for auctioning only 5 mhz of spectrum
 unhen sambhawatah 2014 main shuru hone vaale apane prastaavit punarneojan (spectrum ke) kavayad ke liye 1800 megahterj spectrum bachaakar rakhana tha
 Operators such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea, which came first as part of this reorganization proposal, will have to vacate the highly capable 900 mhz spectrum they currently have after the end of the license period in 2014
 isaki jagah unhen kam sakasham 1800 megahterj bandwidth kaa spectrum diya jayega
 Shortly after this, 900 mhz spectrum will be auctioned at a higher price
 is sector main der se aane vaale reliance or tata jaise oparator tab bhi 900 megahterj ke spectrum hasil karne yogya maane jaaenge
 This one step of less efficient bandwidth (which would require new infrastructure such as installing more towers) would lead to a huge increase in capital costs for many operators
 vodaphone ne anumaan lagaaya he ki punarneojan se use 10,000 karod ru
 Additional investment of Rs
 isi prakaar idia ne 17,000 karod ru
 Additional investment of Rs
 vaise, sarkaar ne sarama kii siforeeshon ko kuch halkaa karte hue yah kaha he ki puraane operataron ko 900 megahterj bandwidth ke 2
 It will be allowed to keep 5 mhz spectrum
 lekin is riyaayat ke baavjood puraani telecom companiyon ke maathe karj kaa boj or bad jayega
 What should be the future? The failure of the latest auction has provided some relief to an industry whose financial health is deteriorating
 telecom udyog ko ab sarkaar se bahut zyada ummid nahin he
 He will have to make strategies on his own and move forward on it
 *tarriff main badhotaree
 Former TRAI head Sarma had estimated that his recommendation to increase reserve prices would increase call rates by only 2 to 3 paise per minute
 lekin is udyog kaa anumaan he ki kol daron main prati minute 30 paise ke aasapaas tak ijapha karnaa padegaa
 The truth may lie somewhere between these two hypotheses
 tri ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha, ‘’sifarish kaa asar prati minute 8 paise tak ho saktaa he
 "* Invest in low cost, low access circles
 pehle din nilaamee kii feeki shuruyaat ke bich bihar cirkil (rigerv keemat 44

 ) ke liye aath boliyaan, assam cirkil (rigerv keemat 8

 ) ke liye saat boliyaan or jammu-kashmir cirkil (rigerv keemat 6

 ), mumbai (rigerv keemat 678
 45 crores Rs
 ) or karnataka (rigerv keemat 330
 1 Crore Rs
 ) ke liye koi bhi boli lagane nahin aayaa
 Matthews said, "the main reason for no bids coming for Delhi, Mumbai and Karnataka is that there is no possibility of increasing business in these circles
" yah nilaamee sirf 1800 megahterj (vaayas kol ke liye istemaal spectrum) ke liye ho rahi he, isliye aise spectrum ke liye boli lagane main koi kaarobaari samajhadaari nahin he
 This has led to higher bids for circles like Bihar and Northeast
 ” telecom vibhaag ke ek varisht adhikari ise ‘‘idia kii ranneeti’’ bataate hai
 Idea Cellular has been at the forefront of the strategy that instead of spreading more legs, it should first make deep penetration to the very interior areas of a state (like Maharashtra) to attract more consumers to one place
 *consolidation
 Addressing the India Investment Forum held in New York in September, the current head of TRAI Rahul Khullar said that he felt that the number of players in each circle would be reduced from 13 to eight-nine
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah ghatakar chah tak bhi ja sakati he
 "TRAI is actually in favor of consolidation (avoidance of some strong players from mergers and acquisitions)
 telecom udyog ke liye agle teen saal kaaphi mahatvapurn honge
 Including the entire industry, there will be losses in 2012-13 and 2013-14
 yah udyog phir 2014-15 tak hi munaafe main aa paaegaa

 In every Cricket World Cup, there is a team which is famous for its vicissitudes

 When Gulbadin Nayib's team defeated Pakistan in the warm-up match before the World Cup league match started, the speculation was further strengthened that Afghanistan would surely make a big bang

 Bullets and bombs were raining all over Afghanistan during the Taliban regime, with the Taliban slaughtering people like animals, so continuing a game like cricket under the nose of the Taliban was nothing short of a game of death
 halaat itane kharaab ho chuke the ki khiladiyon ke paas practice karne ke liye jagah tak nahin hua karti thi
 But it is said that 'often, in front of high spirits, success suffers
 ' afghanistan ke khilaadiyon ne apni practice sharnaarthi shiviron main jari rakhi

 Rashid Khan told The Daily Telegraph in an interview that sports are the only thing that brings peace to the country
 vah ipiel ko kaaphi time se follow karte aae hai or usee ipiel siries kaa hissaa bananaa unke liye kisi sapane ke sach hone jaisaa tha
 Rashid Khan also told that the experience of IPL was quite different from any other league
 duniya ke shreshth khilaadiyon ke saath khelnaa or anbhavi peshewaron kii nigaraanee main abhyaas karnaa or sabase badi baat phens kii umadti bheed or unase milane vaala pyaar ragon main josh kii lahar bhar detaa he

 In the same way, it is bound to show laziness in people as soon as winter comes
 chote ho yaa phir bade sabko sardi ke dinon main padhane kaa man nahin karata he
 And on the other hand, when the process of examination starts, this laziness doubles
 ham aapako kuch tips bataa rahe hai jinaki madad se aap aam dinon kii tarah hi sardiyon main bhi aasaani se pard sakate hai:1
 Study in warm clothes: Winter has come, in such a situation you should take special care of your health while studying
 padhai karte samay aapako kambal se duuri bana leni hi chahie taaki aap padhai par focus rakh sake
 For this, wear warm clothes and yes, use socks and warm hat
 dhyaan rahe zyada kapade bhi mat pahan len jisase aapke sharir par boj bad jaaen or aap thak kar so jaaen
 2
 letkar nahin, baith kar karen padhai:sardiyon ke mausam main jo akasar dekha gaya he ki students khud ko comfortable rakhane ke liye letkar padhanaa zyada pasand karte hai
 By doing this, you will increase laziness and sleep
 isse bachane ke liye aap kursi par yaa phir bed par baith kar padhanaa chahie
 3
 lagaataar nahin padhein, chote-chote brake lete rahen:ghanton lagaataar padhane se thakaan badhati he saath hi boring lagane lagata he
 Try to get up at half an hour and move around a bit
 isse aap fresh feel karenge saath hi puri energy ke saath dobaaraa dhyaan se pard sakenge
 4
 khan-paan kaa khaas khyaal rakhen:sardiyon kaa mausam he to garma-garam khaane kii chahat bhi hogi
 If he is in the house, he would like more
 aise main koshish karen ki khaanaa zyada maatra main na khaaen
 If you do this then you will feel sleepy and you will not be able to focus on your study
 5
 Take hot drinks: Tea, coffee can be taken while reading to keep yourself in charge
 agar aap chaay- coffee donon main se kuch nahin pite hai to pareshaan hone kii baat nahin, aap garam doodh pi sakate hai jo ki sehat ke liye bhi kaaphi acha sabit hoga
 6
 routine kaa rakhen khaas khyaal:agar exam sar par ho to aap apane liye ek routine bana len
 Abandon laziness and try to give your studies in the morning
 bade-bujurgon ke mutabik subah kaa samay padhai ke liye best mana jaataa he
 Apart from this, whatever you remember at this time, the scope of forgetting in the exam will also be less
 7
 Choose a place: You can choose a place to study where you get sunlight
 iske liye apane jarurat ke samaan ko ek bag main len or apane ghar ke chat par, balakani main, park main yaa phir waisi jagah jahaan aapako aasaani se dhoop milen
 By trying these methods, you can not only concentrate on your study but also you can bring a lot of interestingness in your study methods, which will make you feel like reading
 8
 The game is also important: if you think that playing the exam time will waste your time, then you are wrong
 khud ko rifresh karne ke liye aap badminton, chess khel kar khud ko charge rakh sakate hai
 9
 librari main padhein:skool- college librari main padhanaa zyada aasaana hota he
 The main reason for this is the atmosphere there
 agar aapke aas-paas students padhate najar aaenge to aapako neend nahin aegi balki ek compitishan kii bhaavana badhengi
 10
 group study bhi he ek acha opshan:apane doston ke saath group main baithkar ghar kii chat par yaa park main padhanaa ek acha opshan sabit ho saktaa he
 By doing this, you will feel good in studies as well as you will get a direction and you will be able to overcome the confusion in the studies by discussing with your friends

 khyaal to harek jehan main aate hai
 
 
 Good bad, big and small
 lekin kisi khyaal ko alfaaz dene kaa hunar harek ke paas nahin hota or hunar bhi aisa ki jo sune yaa padhe to use wo alfaaz khud apane lagane lagen
 He is so attached to the emotion hidden in those alphabets as if he wants to say that his heart cannot be separated from it
 rupesh kashyap kii ye koshish yaa yun bhi kaha jaae ki aisi hi ek khubasurat misaal he unki kavy sankalan algoza
 In which he did his first work, bypassing the rituals and customs of poetry
 rupesh kashyap ne apane jajbaton ko bade hi khubasurat tareeke se usee andaaj main alfaaz kii shakl de di jis andaaj main wo unke jehan main kaundhe honge, yani ye baat kahana lajimi ho jaataa he ki unhone apnekhayalon or alphajonke saath koi beyimaani nahin kii
 Recorded the paper with the same honesty as i thought
 unki kavitaaon kii sarthakata ko or bhi zyada dilachasp bana detii he kavi ashok chakradhar kii wo tamaam tippaniyan jisamen wo rupesh kii kavitaaon se khud ko or khud kii likhi rachanaaon se jodate dikhaai dete hai
 By referring to an anecdote, Ashok Chakradhar has testified in the right of the poet here, how Rupesh Kashyap not only won his heart by the freshness of the poems, but also forced him to call a new creator and make him happy
 
 ek gavaahi or saamne ai, jiskaa zikr karnaa isliye bhi jaruri he ki kisi bhi hunar ko kisi khaas ilaake kii jarurat nahin ho sakati
 Rather, it is generally seen that skill is produced in those areas only
 jis ilaake ke bare main log shaayad ye gumaan paal lete hai ki yahaan se saamne kya aayega
 But the one thing that is irrelevant is that after reading some poems, it starts to feel incomplete
 aisa mahasoos hota he ki jis baat ko kavi ne uthaane kaa prayaas kiya, jis takat or man se usne is baat ko kehane kajajbatdikhaya, wo baat achaanak bich main hi kyon chhodana munasib samajha
 For example, no sleep
 
 
 kavita main baat shuru bhi nahin hui ki khatm ho gai
 It seems that there is something else that is probably needed by alphas
 lekin baat chann se khatm hone kaa ahsaas karvaa detii he, jo khatkati mahasoos ho rahi he, jaise unki ek kavita he tii-20, yahaan unhone tii yani chaay-20 likhaa or use us ghadi se joda jo in dinon logon ke jehan main junun banakar gum rahaa he
 But sarcasm on one of the arrangements of the country, suddenly stopping him like this also got a bit Akhar
 kyonki yahaan kavi se ummid kar rahaa tha ki wo is bandobast par kuch aisa karaara prahaar kar saktaa he jis par aksar kalam or jubaan donon hi khamosh nazar aate hai
 But one has to appreciate the Hindi duo who gave the book form of this poetry of Rupesh Kashyap and the homepage of this book Algoza is really amazing, because the way the two flute instruments are depicted in it
 uske bare main shaayad yahi dharna baithti ja rahi he ki ye vaadya ab kahinitihaas main khonelaga he
 The more melodious this instrument is seen
 rupesh kashyap kii kavitaaon ko doharaate vakt iske sarthak hone kaa gumaan hona lajimi he
 It will not be wrong to say here that Rupesh Kashyap has been successful in recording the story not only of the experiences of his life but also of his experiences
 jise har us shaks ko padhane kii jarurat he jo vaaki sangharsh ko jindagi kaa ahm hissaa maanata he

 puja ne kaha, 'udhaaharan ke liye aap 'master shef australia' or 'master shef india' kii tulana karke dekhie
 How food is filmed abroad is an art

 He shared a lot of things related to cooking and cuisine

 Pooja says that she is energetic due to the right food and drink

 Input from 'IANS' jab koi bada udyog sankat main hota he to use di jane vaali madad ko protsaahan (incentive) kehete hai or jab vahi sahaayta kisaanon ko di jaati he to use sabsidi kehete hai
 Why is there such a discriminatory mindset? " When Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this on January 31 at his residence at 7 Race Course Road from the representatives of bjp's Kisan Morcha, it was pointing to the change in the thinking of the government, which was bitten by 8 of the Land Acquisition Ordinance
 Withstood for months
 vipaksh ke saath-saath sangh parivaar se jude sanghathanon ne bhi modi sarkaar ke khilaaf saarvajanik morcha khol diya tha, jisase sarkaar par kisaan virdohi or udyogpatiyon kaa samarthak hone kaa thappa lagane laga
 But will BJP be able to make its electoral land fertile before 2019 general election, just ahead of the general budget to be presented on February 29? Farmers in four states of the country are going to address the rally
 sarkaar kii badali hui ranneeti par centre for da study of develping societes ke nideshak sanjay kumaar kehete hai, “raajnneeti main dharanaon kii badi ahm bhoomika he
 There is no doubt that the Modi government's image had become pro-corporate at the time of the Land Acquisition Ordinance, but when the situation returned to normal over time, it was necessary for the government to change its image
 isliye sarkaar kisaan se jude pahaluon par focus kar rahi he
 "but the question is why did BJP realize its need when the Modi government's two years are coming to an end? Why did the farmers remember? In fact, most of the ambitious schemes of the Modi government did not go the way they had hoped
 swatchta mishan fund ke abhaav main vah gati nahin pakad sakaa
 On the other hand, the economy about which Modi has put India's side on the global forums is continuously declining

 So when he decided to review the cabinet meeting on the last Wednesday of every month from January, he first took up the issue of agriculture
 27 janvari ko hui mantrimandaleey baithak main group of secretaries kii ore se taiyaar prajentation dikhaaya gaya
 In this, the cabinet group is divided into three parts - agriculture and allied departments, infrastructure and allied departments, social and core sectors
 is prajentation main dikhaaya gaya ki sarkaar main may 2014 se disambar 2015 tak cabinet ke kul 548 faisle hue jisamen se 89 abhi amal main nahin aae
 Similarly, 82 out of 182 decisions of Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs have not been implemented yet
 is baithak main sarkaar ne bhavishya main unheen yojanaon ko amal main maanane kaa nayaa drushtikon apanaaya, jisaki gatividhi jameen par shuru ho jaae
 The BJP won three times more seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections than in rural areas alone
 lekin jis tarah se bihar main bijepi chunaav haari, or aise ilaakon main kisaan aatmahatyaayein hone lageen, jahaan isaki ummid na thi, daal kii keemten jis tarah se badhin or gramin kshetra main sarkaar ke prati niraashaa panpi, in sab baton ne bijepi kii chintaa badha di
 Apart from this, assembly elections are to be held in a dozen states including West Bengal, Assam, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh by 2018, where farmers can play an important role
 lihaaja bijepi ne ranneeti ke tahat kisaanon ke mudde ko praathamikta di taaki jameen par asar dikhne lage
 According to sources, in the meeting of the cabinet group, Minister of State Manoj Sinha and Sanjeev Balyan said that it will take time to bring the government's decisions to the ground, then the Prime Minister expressed his displeasure that if the work progresses with a positive attitude can be done
 sutron ke mutabik bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne petrol kii keemton main hui kami se bachaae gaye paise ko saamaajik sarokaar or khaas taur se gaanvon par kharch karne kii pairvi kii taaki 2019 ke aam chunaav se pehle jameen par usee tarah kaam dikhe jaisaa upie-1 kii manaregaa skim ko lekar 2009 ke chunaav main dikhaa tha

 chhavi badalane kii chatapataahatshapath lene ke saat maheene ke bheetar modi sarkaar ne bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main sudhaar ke liye 29 disambar 2014 ko adhyadesh jari kiya tha
 But even after bringing the ordinance thrice, it could not be passed in the Parliament and finally on 30 August 2015, Modi said with a heavy heart in the radio program Mann Ki Baat, "we brought the ordinance in favor of farmers, but confusion was spread, Farmers were frightened, but i want my farmer not to be confused and should not be frightened at all
 isliye main bhoomi adhigrahan par puraani sthiti punaru sthapit kar rahaa hum
 After this, the BJP realized that the anti-farmer stamp could move its land acquired in the Lok Sabha elections
 isliye sarkaar saamaajik sarokaaron par bajet ko badhaane par vichaar kar rahi he
 Modi, while ridiculing MNREGA, called it a pack of Congress failures in the Lok Sabha
 lekin iske 10 saal puraa hone par sarkaar ne bad-chadhakar kaarykram yojit kiye or use aage badhaane kaa shrey lene kii koshish kii
 During the foreign tour with industrialists and during the visit of US President Barack Obama to India, Modi also brought the issue to the opposition by wearing a suit with the name written on it
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne suut-boot kii sarkaar kaa jumala oochaal diya tha
 According to sources, Modi has initiated an initiative towards changing the image

 In this, there will be an attempt to describe crop insurance scheme as historic and farmer friendly

 BJP Kisan Morcha national president Vijaypal Singh Tomar says, "where our government is there, Kisan Chaupal, Yatra, all will be told through Modi government's steps in agriculture, but where there are non BJP governments there will be an agitational stance And there will be sit-in programs on the inefficiency of the state government

 Till now the Mahajan has not given any priority to the farmers and the Land Acquisition Ordinance, “there is no doubt about the intention of the PM

 The BJP made many important promises to the people of Uttar Pradesh before coming to the assembly elections and during campaigning
 ye vaade mahaj 'jumale' banakar na rah jaaen, yah nai sarkaar kii chunauti rahegi
 According to political analysts, the challenge before the BJP government will be to fulfill the promises made by the party and the Prime Minister to the people of UP
 upra chunaav main prachaar ke dauraan bhaajapa kii taraf se kai sanvadensheel muddon ko bhi hawa di gai
 Big claims were made on behalf of the BJP government at the Center
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apni kai jansabhaon main jor dekar kaha tha ki upra main bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad cabinet kii pehali baithak main hi laghu va seemaant kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar diya jayega
 Everyone will keep an eye on the Prime Minister's promise that what the farmers get in the first meeting of the cabinet
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha tha ki upra kaa saansad hone ke naate vah is baat kii khud nigaraanee karenge ki upra kii sarkaar acha kaam kar rahi he yaa nahin
 Apart from this, the Prime Minister had also raised the issue of 'cremation and graveyard' in the midst of elections
 sapa kii sarkaar par unhone yah aarope lagaaya tha ki sarkaar kabristaan kii chaharadivari ke liye paryaapt dhan to de rahi he, lekin shmashaan ke liye vah koi suvidha nahin de rahi he
 After the formation of the government in UP, what will be the attitude of the BJP regarding the crematorium and the cemetery, it will also be very interesting to see
 modi ke in bayanon ko lekar bibisi ke purv patrkaar or 'north block south block' ke sampadak durgesh upaadhyaay ne ieenes se baatcheet ke dauraan kaha ki sarkaar ke gathan ke baad vaaki sarkaar par apane vaadon ko puraa karne kaa dabaav hoga
 Upadhyay said, "after the formation of bjp's absolute majority government in UP, the issue of anti-romeo team, loan waiver of farmers and development of Bundelkhand will be there, along with the BJP will have to work a lot on law and order in UP
 bhaajapa hameshaa se is mudde ko lekar sapa ko gherti rahi he, lihaaja use ab in muddon par janata ko jawaab dena hoga
 " unhone kaha ki haalanki ek sambhaavna yah bhi he ki pradhanmantri modi kii najar upra kii sarkaar par rahegi, kyonki varsh 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav se pehle yahaan kai vaade puure karne honge, kyonki chunaav main sabhi dal unase bhi hisaab maangenge
 During the election campaign in UP, BJP national president Amit Shah had repeatedly raised the issue that an anti-romeo team would be formed to prevent tampering outside colleges and schools in UP
 bhaajapa ne is chunaav main teen talaak ke mudde ko bhi kaaphi hawa di thi
 The party had said that it would go to the Supreme Court on this issue so that Muslim women could get rid of the triple talaq
 raajnneetik vishleshak haalanki yah maan rahe hai ki upra main muslim bahul ilaakon main bhi bhaajapa ne kaaphi acha pradarshan kiya he
 From this it seems that before the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP will give more edge to this issue so that its political benefits can be taken
 bhaajapa ne apane chunavi sankalpapatr main sarkaar banane ke baad bundelkhand vikaas board or purvachal vikaas board ke gathan kii baat kahi thi
 After the formation of an absolute majority government, there will be pressure to develop those areas
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ne jahaan bundelkhand kii sabhi 19 siton par kabja jamaaya he, vahiin purvachal main bhi usne kaaphi shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Now the BJP government will be under pressure to get development in these areas
 tippaniyan Senior journalist and political analyst Vijay Shankar Pankaj said, "it will be really interesting to see what attitude the BJP government of UP takes on these sensitive issues
 is sarkaar ke paas ab koi bahaanaa bhi nahin hoga
 He has a government at the center

 ) pradhanmantri ke is vaade par bhi sabaki nazren rahengi ki cabinet kii pehali baithak main kisaanon ko kya-kya miltaa he
 At the same time, he also said that as a member of Uttar Pradesh, he will personally monitor whether the UP government is doing good or not
 iske alaava pradhanmantri ne chunaav ke bich main hi 'shmashaan or kabristaan' kaa mudda bhi uthaaya tha
 He had accused the SP government that the government was providing sufficient funds for the boundary wall of the cemetery, but was not providing any facilities for the crematorium
 upra main sarkaar banane ke baad shmashaan or kabristaan ko lekar bhaajapa kaa kya rukh rahata he, yah bhi dekhnaa kaaphi dilachasp hoga
 On these statements of Modi, former BBC journalist and 'north Block South Block' editor Durgesh Upadhyay said during a conversation with IANS that after the formation of the government there will be pressure on the government to fulfill its promises
 upaadhyaay ne kaha, "upra main bhaajapa kii purna bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad anti-romeo team, kisaanon kii karjamaafee or bundelkhand ke vikaas kaa mudda to rahegaa hi, saath main bhaajapa ko upra main kanoon vyavastha ko lekar bhi kaaphi kaam karnaa hoga
 The BJP has always surrounded the SP on this issue, so it will now have to answer to the public on these issues
 " He said, however, that there is a possibility that Prime Minister Modi will keep an eye on the government of Uttar Pradesh, because before the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, many promises will have to be fulfilled here, because in the election all parties will also ask for their accounts
 upra main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne baar-baar yah mudda uthaaya tha ki upra main college or skulon ke baahar ho rahi chhedhkhani ko rokane ke liye anti-romeo team banaai jaaegi
 The BJP also gave a lot of air to the issue of triple talaq in this election
 party ne kaha tha ki is mudde ko lekar vah supreme court jaaegi, taaki muslim mahilaon ko teen talaak se chhutkaaraa mil sake
 Political analysts, however, believe that the BJP has done well in the Muslim-dominated areas of Uttar Pradesh
 isse aisa lag rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bhaajapa is mudde ko or dhar degi, taaki iskaa raajnneetik laabh liya ja sake
 The BJP had, in its election resolution, talked about the formation of the Bundelkhand Development Board and Purvanchal Development Board after forming the government
 purna bahumat kii sarkaar banane ke baad iskaa gathan kar un ilaakon ke vikaas kaa bhi dabaav hoga
 In the assembly elections, where the BJP has captured all 19 seats in Bundelkhand, it has also performed very well in Purvanchal
 ab bhaajapa kii sarkaar par in kshetron main vikaas karaane kaa dabaav hoga
 The comments varisht patrkaar or raajnneetik vishleshak vijay shankar pankaj ne kaha, "vaaki yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki upra kii bhaajapa sarkaar in samvedansheel muddon ko lekar kya rukh apanaati he
 This government will not have any excuse now
 centre main unki sarkaar he
 If the UP government wants to, then now the development of Purvanchal and Bundelkhand can be done
 " unhone kaha, "ab tak kii sarkarein yahi ronaa roti rahi hai ki centre sarkaar madad nahin kar rahi he
 But now there will be BJP government both at the center and the state
 lihaaja, ab yah bahaanaa bhi nahin chalegaa
 "BJP is accepting these issues as a challenge
 bhaajapa ke pradesh pravaktaa manish shukla ne kaha, "janata ne jis ummid ke saath upra main bhaajapa ko sarkaar banane kaa mauka diya he, ham us par khara utrenge

 Any news happens in the country, these youngsters keep messaging day and night about their jobs
 meri naukari, meri pariksha kaa kab dikhaaenge
 Youth are waiting from one year to three years after taking the exam, so after filling the form many times, the exam is not known till four
 yah series isliye band karnaa zaruri he kyonki samasya vikaraal ho chuki he
 Whenever i think of closing, i am shocked to hear the story of a young man
 tab lagata he ki aaj ek or baar ke liye dikhaa dete hai or phir series band nahin kar paata
 Today's story i begin with an anecdote
 mujhe to yakeen hi nahin ho rahaa he ki yah sahi bhi hoga lekin aap pehle suniye
 Shankar lives in East Delhi
 usee ke ghar or mohalle kii tasviren hai taaki aapako wo hindustan bhi dikh jaae jahaan se shankar jaise noujvaan sarkari naukariyon kii taiyaari main zindagi beetaa dete hai
 Shankar filled the form for Ordnance Factory Kanpur in 2013
 100 lebar kii bahaali honi thi, jisaki kul selary 20,000 ke aas paas hoti he
 Written test on 1 June 2014, the result of which came on 6 June 2014
 16 or 17 june 2014 ko shaareerik or chikitsa jaanch ho gai
 Police investigation forms were given to be filled
 uske baad ek patr aata he ki kuch abhyarthiyon kii pahchaan main kuch gadabadi he jisaki forensik jaanch hogi
 These people reached for forensic investigation but from December 2014 to August 2018
 inhen jwining ke liye nahin bulaayaa gaya
 Shankar claims that no one was called
 chaar saal pariksha main paas hokar intazaar hi karata rah gaya
 Shankar has sent the recording with the help of his partner
 ab aapse ek sawaal he
 Was what happened to youngsters like Shankar right? is pariksha kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha march 2013 main
 By 2014, these people had passed the examination, completed the entire process of investigation, etc
, and then there was no rumor for four years
 uske baad raksha mantralay ke tahat ardinance factory kaa aadesh aata he ki march 2013 main jo vigyaapan niklaa tha, jiske tahat 100 lebar kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru kii gai thi wo sire se radd kar di jaati he
 It is signed by the Additional General Manager
 chaar saal baad janaab inaki niyukti kii prakriya hi radd ho gai
 For this exam, these youngsters had filled the form of Rs 50
 wo bhi pani main gaya
 There is no trace of the exam for four years, one day it is said that the process which was started is canceled
 ek pankti kaa kaaran bataaya jaataa he
 This is not an issue for prime time television
 is vakt tivi par theme or theory vaala mudda chaaya rahata he jaise 2019 main modi ke saamne koun he
 Which idol should have a statue in the three idols
 in sab muddon par bahes khub hoti he
 Topics with themes and theory come with great knowledge and knowledge
 idhar noujvaan meri jaan ke peeche pade rahete hai ki aap kyon nahi dikhaate hai ki hamaare saath kya ho rahaa he
 Why is there no debate on the issue which stands before the youth of today
 nahin he
 Shankar said one more thing in his statement
 2016 main usne ardinance factory ke liye phir form bharaa
 Exams were to be held in three batches
 ek batch kii pariksha hui magar phir vahi aadesh aayaa ki baaki ke do batch kii pariksha radd kii jaati he
 From 2013 to 2018, Shankar is unemployed
 hamane naukari series ke dauraan kai baar dekha he ki pariksha hoti he or ant main kisi na kisi kaaran radd kii jaati he or phir dobaaraa kab hogi pataa nahin chalata, kai baar dobaaraa bhi nahin hoti he
 Millions of youth of India are engaged in government job examination
 koi railway kii taiyaari kar rahaa he to koi banking kii to koi esayssi kii
 Because there are a number of recruitment of these jobs
 chaatro ko pataa hota he ki kitni seat ai he
 He never gets to know when and where he has got so many seats in the private sector
 mandi or notebandi ke baad se jinaki naukari gai he unamem se bahut kam ko dobaaraa kaam mila he
 Many statistics of this is not a job, it keeps on coming from time to time
 haal hi main karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan ne apane aankadon kii samiksha main paaya ki pichley das maheene main 46 lakh logon kii naukari ja chuki he yaa unhen dobaaraa kaam nahin mila
 It is not that there is no job
 privet sector kii naukariyon kii sankhya kaa bhale pataa na chale lekin sarkari naukariyon kaa motaa-moti hisaab he
 According to the recent statements made in Parliament, the government has 24 lakh jobs
 america patrkaar steven bril ne ek kitaab likhi he telespin
 In this book, he has written that the process of recruitment in government jobs in America is very long and complex
 kya aap jaanate hai ki vahaan kitna samay lagata he jise lekar steven bril naaraaz hai
 90 days only
 bharat main sarkari naukariyon kii bahaali main chaar chaar saal lagate hai
 We are also mentioning this because Sanjay Kumar and Pranab Gupta have written an article in the Mint newspaper
 siesds ke lokaneeti kaarykram ke tahat yuvaaon ke bich vyapak survey kiya gaya he
 It has also tried to see why the youth have a fascination for government jobs
 is survey kaa nateeja yah he ki yuvaaon main privet naukari ke prati aakarshan kam hua or sarkari naukari ke prati kaaphi badha he
 They know that on becoming an MLA and MP, they get pension from two places, there is no pension in government job, yet the stability of the job is not in private job
 doosraa ab unhen pataa chal gaya he ki sarkari naukari main kuch kam hi sahi, sabko ek baraabar selary milti he
 In the private sector, hard work and sourness is more, earnings are less
 in naujavaanon ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki 50 rupee se 1000 rupee form bharne ke liye ja rahe hai
 The test takes place but the result does not come
 65 pratishat yuva sarkari naukari chahta he
 Only 7 percent want to work in private
 19 pratishat aise hai jo apana bijness karnaa chaahate hai
 It says the survey of CSDS which has been done about the youth, which is going to be printed in the form of the book later
 2007 main sarkari naukari chaahane vaale 62 pratishat the, 2016 main badhkar 65 pratishat ho gaye
 In 2007, 48 percent of the youth of big cities wanted government jobs, in 2016 their number increased to 62 percent
 2007 main privet naukari kii chaah rakhane vaale 24 fisadi yuva the, 2016 main inaki sankhya 10 pratishat rah gai
 Big cities are also in decline
 2007 main 17 fisadi the, 2016 main 10 fisadi par aa gaye
 There is nothing wrong in wanting a government job
 kyon nahin sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhni chahie
 The government has 24 lakh vacancies
 wo kyon nahin kah detii he ki sarkari naukari mat kiijie
 What is worse than wanting a government job
 susheel mahapatra ne sarkari naukari kii taiyaari karne vaale naujavaanon se baat kii he
 Job conditions are becoming difficult
 sirf bharat hi nahin, naukari ke sthayitv kaa mudda har desh kaa mudda he
 Now see how the life of the youth is at stake
 kya aap jaanate hai ki bihar main 68500 shikshak 2012 se pariksha paas kar niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Of these, a merit list of about 17000 was made in 2012, not all of them have been appointed in that list
 53, 500 shikshakon kii merit list nahin bani he
 If they do not get a job by 2019, then the exam they have passed will be canceled
 saat saal tak intazaar karne ke baad inaki zindagi barbaad ho jaaegi
 Have any ministers told you on their twitter, you see, minister people tweet such information less, half the time line is of jubilee and death anniversary so that they are seen taking inspiration every day
 2012 main bihar state teacher eligibility test kii pariksha paas karne ke baad bie bied or tet ke number ke aadhaar par inkaa rank taiyaar hona chahie tha or jis bhi hai skool main jahaan jagah he vahaan bahaali ho jaani chahie thi
 But the merit list of 17000 was made and the rest was not
 53,500 shikshakon kii saans ataki hui he ki agar bahaali kii prakriya jaldi shuru nahin hui to unke riselt kii manyata samaapt ho jaaegi or ve teacher banane kii paatrata jivan bhar ke liye kho denge
 He agitated many times
 is mantri se mili, us mantri se mili, vidhansabha main prashn uthaa magar aashwaasan or bhaashan ke baad sab kuch saamaanya ho gaya
 According to these teachers, the posts of 19000 teachers in Bihar schools are vacant
 bihar main 5700 skool bina shikshakon ke chal rahe hai
 Then why are they not being given jobs
 kya kisi ko parvaah nahin he ki rajya kii hi pariksha paas karne ke baad in shikshakon kii naukari kii paatrata agle saal samaapt ho jaaegi? 8 lakh se adhik abhyarthiyon ne is pariksha ke liye form bhare the or sabane dedh sau rupee jamaa kiye the
 What happened to this money? 68500 paas hue the
 Sushil Modi's statement has been published in the newspaper of 30 August 2016
 wo abhi up mukhyamantri hai magar tab vipaksh main the
 He had then said that the government does not want to appoint teachers, making excuses
 uski cliping hamaare paas he
 Let us tell you that one million posts of teachers are vacant in schools across the country, but in every state, teachers are agitating by passing the eligibility test
 tippaniyan In Uttar Pradesh too, youngsters who have passed the TET exam are waiting for jobs
 andolan dharna aashwaasan bhaashan karke thak gaye magar unki bahaali nahin ho rahi he
 We will also detail them in prime time
 ek or patr aayaa he jisamen kaha gaya he ki bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne agast 2014 main 13,000 clerk kii niyukti kaa vigyaapan nikaala tha
 Today it has been four years but there is no trace of that test
 ek baar farvari 2017 main pariksha hui magar radd ho gai
 Even if the selection process starts now, it will still take 2 years
 is pariksha ke form ko bharne ke liye 250 rupee liye gaye the
 In America, the process of government job is done in 90 days and you saw that in August 2014, 13000 clerk advertisements were released, but after four years, there was not a single examination
 sarkarein kyon nahin kah detii hai ki ve ab naukari nahin dengi
 If the unemployed want to see their story in the media, then they have to fight against the topic of the media and the topic
 jisamen jaankaar kot pahanakar badi-badi baaten karte hai or jin bahason main naukari kaa sawaal maamuli sawaal lagata he
 You tell me that you want a job and whose idol will be included in the three idols
 aaj kii kahani main ek kisse se shuru karata hum
 i am not sure if this will be right but you first listen
 shankar east dilli main rahata he
 There are pictures of his house and locality so that you can also see the Hindustan from where youngsters like Shankar spend their lives preparing for government jobs
 shankar ne 2013 main ardinance factory kanpur ke liye form bharaa tha
 100 labor was to be restored, whose total salary is around 20,000
 1 june 2014 ko likhit pariksha di jiskaa riselt aa gaya 6 june 2014 ko
 Physical and medical examination took place on 16 and 17 June 2014
 police jaanch ke form bharne ko die gaye
 After that a letter comes that there is something wrong in the identity of some candidates, which will be forensic examined
 ye log forensik jaanch ke liye pahunch gaye magar disambar 2014 se lekar agast 2018 aa gaya
 They were not called for joining
 shankar kaa daawa he ki kisi ko nahin bulaayaa gaya
 He kept waiting for four years after passing the exam
 shankar ne apane saathi kii madad se recording bheji he
 Now you have a question
 kya shankar jaise naujavaanon ke saath jo hua wo sahi tha
 The advertisement for this exam was released in March 2013
 2014 tak in logon ne pariksha paas kar, jaanch vagairah kii sari prakriya puri kar lee phir uske chaar saal tak kuch sugabugahat nahin
 After that comes the order of the Ordnance Factory under the Ministry of Defense that the advertisement which was started in March 2013, under which the process of appointment of 100 Labor was started is canceled altogether
 is par adishnal general menager ke dastakhat hai
 After four years, the process of appointing him was canceled
 is pariksha ke liye in naujavaanon ne 50 rupee form ke bhare the
 He also went to the water
 chaar saal tak pariksha kaa ata pataa nahin ek din kaha jaataa he ki jo bhi prakriya shuru hui thi wo radd kii jaati he
 The reason for one line is stated
 prime time television ke liye yah sab mudda nahin he
 At this moment, the issue of theme and theory remains on TV like who is in front of Modi in 2019
 teen murti main kis kis kii murti honi chahie
 There is a lot of debate on all these issues
 theme or theory vaale taapic par bade bade jaankaar aate hai, gyaan baghaarte hai
 Here the youth are behind my life, why don't you show what is happening to us
 jo mudda aaj ke naujavaanon ke saamne khadaa he, us par koi bahes kyon nahin he
 Is not
 shankar ne apane bayaan main ek or baat kahi
 In 2016, he again filled the form for the Ordnance Factory
 teen batch main pariksha honi thi
 One batch examination took place but then the same order came that the remaining two batches are canceled
 2013 se 2018 aa gaya, shankar berojgaar he
 We have seen many times during the job series that the exam takes place and in the end is canceled for some reason and then it is not known when it will happen again, sometimes it does not happen again
 bharat ke lakhon noujvaan sarkari naukari kii pariksha main lage hai
 Some are preparing for Railways, some are banking and some are SSC
 kyonki in naukariyon kii bhartee kii ek sankhya hoti he
 Students know how many seats have been won
 use yah kabhi pataa nahin chalata he ki privet sector main kab or kahaan kitni seat ai he
 Very few of those who have lost jobs since the recession and demonetisation have found work again
 naukari nahin he iske kai aankade samay samay par aate rahete hai
 Recently, the Employees Provident Fund Organization, in a review of its data, found that 46 lakh people had lost their jobs in the last ten months or they could not find work again
 aisa nahin he ki naukari nahi he
 The number of private sector jobs may not be known, but government jobs account for a lot
 haal hi main sansad main die gaye bayanon ke hisaab se sarkaar ke paas 24 lakh naukariyaan hai
 American journalist Steven Brill has written a book called Telespin
 is kitaab main unhone likhaa he ki america main sarkari naukariyon main bhartee kii prakriya bahut lambii or jatil he
 Do you know how long it takes to get there, Steven Brill is angry
 maatr 90 din
 Restoration of government jobs in India takes four years
 ham iskaa zikr isliye bhi kar rahe hai, kyonki sanjay kumaar or pranav gupta ne mint akhbaar main ek lekh likhaa he
 a comprehensive survey has been conducted among the youth under csds's Lokniti program
 usamen yah dekhne kaa bhi prayaas hua he ki yuvaaon main sarkari naukari ke prati aakarshan kyon he
 The result of this survey is that the attraction for private jobs has decreased among the youth and has increased significantly towards government jobs
 unhen pataa he ki vidhayak or saansad banane par do do jagah se pension milti he, sarkari naukari main pension nahin he phir bhi naukari kaa jo sthayitv he vah privet naukari main nahin he
 Secondly, they have now come to know that in government jobs very rarely, everyone gets equal pay
 privet sector main mehnat or khatai zyaada he, kamai kam he
 These youngsters are well aware that Rs 50 to Rs 1000 are going to fill the form
 pariksha hoti he magar riselt nahin aata he
 65 percent of youth want government jobs
 sirf 7 pratishat privet main naukari karnaa chaahate hai
 There are 19 percent who want to do their business
 ye siesds kaa survey kahata he jo yuvaaon ko lekar kiya gaya he, jise aage chalakar kitaab kii shakl main chapa jane vaala he
 Government job seekers were 62 percent in 2007, rising to 65 percent in 2016
 2007 main bade shaharon ke 48 pratishat yuva sarkari naukari chaahate the, 2016 main inaki sankhya 62 fisadi ho gai
 In 2007, 24 per cent of the youths seeking private jobs were young, in 2016 their number was 10 per cent
 bade shaharon main bhi giravat he
 There were 17 per cent in 2007, down to 10 per cent in 2016
 sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhane main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Why should not want a government job
 sarkaar ke paas 24 lakh pad khaali hai
 Why doesn't she say don't do a government job
 bura kya he sarkari naukari kii chahat main
 Sushil Mahapatra has spoken to the youth preparing for the government job
 naukari kii sharten mushkil hoti ja rahi hai
 Not only India, the issue of job stability is the issue of every country
 ab dekhie kis tarah se naujavaanon kii zindagi daanv par lagi he
 Do you know that 68500 teachers in Bihar have been waiting for the appointment since 2012 by passing the exam
 inamen se 2012 main kareeb 17000 kii merit list bani thi, us list main se bhi sabhi kii niyukti nahin hui he
 Merit list of 53, 500 teachers has not been made
 agar inhen 2019 tak naukari nahin mili to inhone jo pariksha paas kii he wo radd ho jaaegi
 After waiting for seven years, their lives will be ruined
 kya aapako kisi mantri ne apane twitor par bataaya he, aap dekhie, mantri log aisi jaankaree kam twit karte hai, aadha time line to jayanti or punyatithi kaa hota he jisase ve har din prerana lete hue nazar aate hai
 After passing the Bihar State Teacher Eligibility Test in 2012, his rank should have been prepared on the basis of BA b
ed
 and Tate's number and should have been restored to any high school where there is a place
 magar 17000 kii merit list bani or baaki kii nahin
 53,500 teachers are breathless that if the restoration process does not start early, their results will be recognized and they will lose their eligibility to become a teacher for a lifetime
 kai baar inhone andolan kiya
 Meet this minister, meet that minister, a question arose in the assembly but after the assurance and speech everything became normal
 in shikshakon ke anusaar bihar ke skulon main 19000 shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 There are 5700 schools in Bihar running without teachers
 phir inhen naukari kyon nahin di ja rahi he
 Does anyone not care that the eligibility for the job of these teachers will end next year after passing the state examination itself? More than 8 lakh candidates had filled the forms for this examination and all had submitted one hundred and fifty rupees
 is paise kaa kya hua
 68500 were passed
 30 agast 2016 ke akhbaar main susheel modi kaa bayaan chapa he
 He is currently the Deputy Chief Minister but was in opposition then
 tab unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar shikshakon ko niyukti nahin dena chaahati he, bahaane bana rahi he
 We have his clipping
 aapako bataa den ki desh bhar ke skulon main shikshakon ke das lakh pad khaali hai magar har rajya main teacher eligibility test paas hokar andolan kar rahe hai
 The comments uttar pradesh main bhi tet kii pariksha paas karne vaale noujvaan naukari kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Tired to make agitation picket assurance speech but their restoration is not happening
 ham unka haal bhi vistaar se prime time main bataaenge
 Another letter has come out stating that in August 2014, Bihar Staff Selection Commission had advertised the appointment of 13,000 clerks
 aaj chaar saal ho gaye magar us pariksha kaa koi ata-pataa nahin he
 The exam was held once in February 2017 but was canceled
 agar ab bhi chayan prakriya shuru hogi to bhi 2 saal lag jaaenge
 250 rupees were taken to fill the form of this examination
 america main sarkari naukari kii prakriya 90 dinon main ho jaati he or aapane dekha ki agast 2014 main 13000 clerk kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha magar chaar saal baad tak ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 Why do governments not say that they will not give jobs now
 berojgaar apni kahani media main dekhnaa chaahate hai to unhen media ke theme and theory vaale taapic se bhi ladanaa hoga
 In which knowledgeable people wear big things wearing coats and in which debates the question of job seems a minor question
 aap bataaiye aapako naukari chahie ki teen murti main kis-kis kii murti lagegi iskaa hisaab chahie
 Shankar has sent the recording with the help of his partner
 ab aapse ek sawaal he
 Was what happened to youngsters like Shankar right? is pariksha kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha march 2013 main
 By 2014, these people had passed the examination, completed the entire process of investigation, etc
, and then there was no rumor for four years
 uske baad raksha mantralay ke tahat ardinance factory kaa aadesh aata he ki march 2013 main jo vigyaapan niklaa tha, jiske tahat 100 lebar kii niyukti kii prakriya shuru kii gai thi wo sire se radd kar di jaati he
 It is signed by the Additional General Manager
 chaar saal baad janaab inaki niyukti kii prakriya hi radd ho gai
 For this exam, these youngsters had filled the form of Rs 50
 wo bhi pani main gaya
 There is no trace of the exam for four years, one day it is said that the process which was started is canceled
 ek pankti kaa kaaran bataaya jaataa he
 This is not an issue for prime time television
 is vakt tivi par theme or theory vaala mudda chaaya rahata he jaise 2019 main modi ke saamne koun he
 Which idol should have a statue in the three idols
 in sab muddon par bahes khub hoti he
 Topics with themes and theory come with great knowledge and knowledge
 idhar noujvaan meri jaan ke peeche pade rahete hai ki aap kyon nahi dikhaate hai ki hamaare saath kya ho rahaa he
 Why is there no debate on the issue which stands before the youth of today
 nahin he
 Shankar said one more thing in his statement
 2016 main usne ardinance factory ke liye phir form bharaa
 Exams were to be held in three batches
 ek batch kii pariksha hui magar phir vahi aadesh aayaa ki baaki ke do batch kii pariksha radd kii jaati he
 From 2013 to 2018, Shankar is unemployed
 hamane naukari series ke dauraan kai baar dekha he ki pariksha hoti he or ant main kisi na kisi kaaran radd kii jaati he or phir dobaaraa kab hogi pataa nahin chalata, kai baar dobaaraa bhi nahin hoti he
 Millions of youth of India are engaged in government job examination
 koi railway kii taiyaari kar rahaa he to koi banking kii to koi esayssi kii
 Because there are a number of recruitment of these jobs

 It is not that there is no job

 Let us tell you that one million posts of teachers are vacant in schools across the country, but in every state, teachers are agitating by passing the eligibility test
 tippaniyan In Uttar Pradesh too, youngsters who have passed the TET exam are waiting for jobs
 andolan dharna aashwaasan bhaashan karke thak gaye magar unki bahaali nahin ho rahi he
 We will also detail them in prime time
 ek or patr aayaa he jisamen kaha gaya he ki bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne agast 2014 main 13,000 clerk kii niyukti kaa vigyaapan nikaala tha
 Today it has been four years but there is no trace of that test
 ek baar farvari 2017 main pariksha hui magar radd ho gai
 Even if the selection process starts now, it will still take 2 years
 is pariksha ke form ko bharne ke liye 250 rupee liye gaye the
 In America, the process of government job is done in 90 days and you saw that in August 2014, 13000 clerk advertisements were released, but after four years, there was not a single examination
 sarkarein kyon nahin kah detii hai ki ve ab naukari nahin dengi
 If the unemployed want to see their story in the media, then they have to fight against the topic of the media and the topic
 jisamen jaankaar kot pahanakar badi-badi baaten karte hai or jin bahason main naukari kaa sawaal maamuli sawaal lagata he
 You tell me that you want a job and whose idol will be included in the three idols
 prime time television ke liye yah sab mudda nahin he
 At this moment, the issue of theme and theory remains on TV like who is in front of Modi in 2019
 teen murti main kis kis kii murti honi chahie
 There is a lot of debate on all these issues
 theme or theory vaale taapic par bade bade jaankaar aate hai, gyaan baghaarte hai
 Here the youth are behind my life, why don't you show what is happening to us
 jo mudda aaj ke naujavaanon ke saamne khadaa he, us par koi bahes kyon nahin he
 Is not
 shankar ne apane bayaan main ek or baat kahi
 In 2016, he again filled the form for the Ordnance Factory
 teen batch main pariksha honi thi
 One batch examination took place but then the same order came that the remaining two batches are canceled
 2013 se 2018 aa gaya, shankar berojgaar he
 We have seen many times during the job series that the exam takes place and in the end is canceled for some reason and then it is not known when it will happen again, sometimes it does not happen again
 bharat ke lakhon noujvaan sarkari naukari kii pariksha main lage hai
 Some are preparing for Railways, some are banking and some are SSC
 kyonki in naukariyon kii bhartee kii ek sankhya hoti he
 Students know how many seats have been won
 use yah kabhi pataa nahin chalata he ki privet sector main kab or kahaan kitni seat ai he
 Very few of those who have lost jobs since the recession and demonetisation have found work again
 naukari nahin he iske kai aankade samay samay par aate rahete hai
 Recently, the Employees Provident Fund Organization, in a review of its data, found that 46 lakh people had lost their jobs in the last ten months or they could not find work again
 aisa nahin he ki naukari nahi he
 The number of private sector jobs may not be known, but government jobs account for a lot
 haal hi main sansad main die gaye bayanon ke hisaab se sarkaar ke paas 24 lakh naukariyaan hai
 American journalist Steven Brill has written a book called Telespin
 is kitaab main unhone likhaa he ki america main sarkari naukariyon main bhartee kii prakriya bahut lambii or jatil he
 Do you know how long it takes to get there, Steven Brill is angry
 maatr 90 din
 Restoration of government jobs in India takes four years
 ham iskaa zikr isliye bhi kar rahe hai, kyonki sanjay kumaar or pranav gupta ne mint akhbaar main ek lekh likhaa he
 a comprehensive survey has been conducted among the youth under csds's Lokniti program
 usamen yah dekhne kaa bhi prayaas hua he ki yuvaaon main sarkari naukari ke prati aakarshan kyon he
 The result of this survey is that the attraction for private jobs has decreased among the youth and has increased significantly towards government jobs
 unhen pataa he ki vidhayak or saansad banane par do do jagah se pension milti he, sarkari naukari main pension nahin he phir bhi naukari kaa jo sthayitv he vah privet naukari main nahin he
 Secondly, they have now come to know that in government jobs very rarely, everyone gets equal pay
 privet sector main mehnat or khatai zyaada he, kamai kam he
 These youngsters are well aware that Rs 50 to Rs 1000 are going to fill the form
 pariksha hoti he magar riselt nahin aata he
 65 percent of youth want government jobs
 sirf 7 pratishat privet main naukari karnaa chaahate hai
 There are 19 percent who want to do their business
 ye siesds kaa survey kahata he jo yuvaaon ko lekar kiya gaya he, jise aage chalakar kitaab kii shakl main chapa jane vaala he
 Government job seekers were 62 percent in 2007, rising to 65 percent in 2016
 2007 main bade shaharon ke 48 pratishat yuva sarkari naukari chaahate the, 2016 main inaki sankhya 62 fisadi ho gai
 In 2007, 24 per cent of the youths seeking private jobs were young, in 2016 their number was 10 per cent
 bade shaharon main bhi giravat he
 There were 17 per cent in 2007, down to 10 per cent in 2016
 sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhane main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Why should not want a government job
 sarkaar ke paas 24 lakh pad khaali hai
 Why doesn't she say don't do a government job
 bura kya he sarkari naukari kii chahat main
 Sushil Mahapatra has spoken to the youth preparing for the government job
 naukari kii sharten mushkil hoti ja rahi hai
 Not only India, the issue of job stability is the issue of every country
 ab dekhie kis tarah se naujavaanon kii zindagi daanv par lagi he
 Do you know that 68500 teachers in Bihar have been waiting for the appointment since 2012 by passing the exam
 inamen se 2012 main kareeb 17000 kii merit list bani thi, us list main se bhi sabhi kii niyukti nahin hui he
 Merit list of 53, 500 teachers has not been made
 agar inhen 2019 tak naukari nahin mili to inhone jo pariksha paas kii he wo radd ho jaaegi
 After waiting for seven years, their lives will be ruined
 kya aapako kisi mantri ne apane twitor par bataaya he, aap dekhie, mantri log aisi jaankaree kam twit karte hai, aadha time line to jayanti or punyatithi kaa hota he jisase ve har din prerana lete hue nazar aate hai
 After passing the Bihar State Teacher Eligibility Test in 2012, his rank should have been prepared on the basis of BA b
ed
 and Tate's number and should have been restored to any high school where there is a place
 magar 17000 kii merit list bani or baaki kii nahin
 53,500 teachers are breathless that if the restoration process does not start early, their results will be recognized and they will lose their eligibility to become a teacher for a lifetime
 kai baar inhone andolan kiya
 Meet this minister, meet that minister, a question arose in the assembly but after the assurance and speech everything became normal
 in shikshakon ke anusaar bihar ke skulon main 19000 shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 There are 5700 schools in Bihar running without teachers
 phir inhen naukari kyon nahin di ja rahi he
 Does anyone not care that the eligibility for the job of these teachers will end next year after passing the state examination itself? More than 8 lakh candidates had filled the forms for this examination and all had submitted one hundred and fifty rupees
 is paise kaa kya hua
 68500 were passed
 30 agast 2016 ke akhbaar main susheel modi kaa bayaan chapa he
 He is currently the Deputy Chief Minister but was in opposition then
 tab unhone kaha tha ki sarkaar shikshakon ko niyukti nahin dena chaahati he, bahaane bana rahi he
 We have his clipping
 aapako bataa den ki desh bhar ke skulon main shikshakon ke das lakh pad khaali hai magar har rajya main teacher eligibility test paas hokar andolan kar rahe hai
 The comments uttar pradesh main bhi tet kii pariksha paas karne vaale noujvaan naukari kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Tired to make agitation picket assurance speech but their restoration is not happening
 ham unka haal bhi vistaar se prime time main bataaenge
 Another letter has come out stating that in August 2014, Bihar Staff Selection Commission had advertised the appointment of 13,000 clerks
 aaj chaar saal ho gaye magar us pariksha kaa koi ata-pataa nahin he
 The exam was held once in February 2017 but was canceled
 agar ab bhi chayan prakriya shuru hogi to bhi 2 saal lag jaaenge
 250 rupees were taken to fill the form of this examination
 america main sarkari naukari kii prakriya 90 dinon main ho jaati he or aapane dekha ki agast 2014 main 13000 clerk kaa vigyaapan niklaa tha magar chaar saal baad tak ek bhi pariksha nahin hui
 Why do governments not say that they will not give jobs now
 berojgaar apni kahani media main dekhnaa chaahate hai to unhen media ke theme and theory vaale taapic se bhi ladanaa hoga
 In which knowledgeable people wear big things wearing coats and in which debates the question of job seems a minor question
 aap bataaiye aapako naukari chahie ki teen murti main kis-kis kii murti lagegi iskaa hisaab chahie
 Millions of youth of India are engaged in government job examination
 koi railway kii taiyaari kar rahaa he to koi banking kii to koi esayssi kii
 Because there are a number of recruitment of these jobs
 chaatro ko pataa hota he ki kitni seat ai he
 He never gets to know when and where he has got so many seats in the private sector
 mandi or notebandi ke baad se jinaki naukari gai he unamem se bahut kam ko dobaaraa kaam mila he
 Many statistics of this is not a job, it keeps on coming from time to time
 haal hi main karmchaaree bhavishya nidhi sanghathan ne apane aankadon kii samiksha main paaya ki pichley das maheene main 46 lakh logon kii naukari ja chuki he yaa unhen dobaaraa kaam nahin mila
 It is not that there is no job
 privet sector kii naukariyon kii sankhya kaa bhale pataa na chale lekin sarkari naukariyon kaa motaa-moti hisaab he
 According to the recent statements made in Parliament, the government has 24 lakh jobs
 america patrkaar steven bril ne ek kitaab likhi he telespin
 In this book, he has written that the process of recruitment in government jobs in America is very long and complex
 kya aap jaanate hai ki vahaan kitna samay lagata he jise lekar steven bril naaraaz hai
 90 days only
 bharat main sarkari naukariyon kii bahaali main chaar chaar saal lagate hai
 We are also mentioning this because Sanjay Kumar and Pranab Gupta have written an article in the Mint newspaper
 siesds ke lokaneeti kaarykram ke tahat yuvaaon ke bich vyapak survey kiya gaya he
 It has also tried to see why the youth have a fascination for government jobs
 is survey kaa nateeja yah he ki yuvaaon main privet naukari ke prati aakarshan kam hua or sarkari naukari ke prati kaaphi badha he
 They know that on becoming an MLA and MP, they get pension from two places, there is no pension in government job, yet the stability of the job is not in private job
 doosraa ab unhen pataa chal gaya he ki sarkari naukari main kuch kam hi sahi, sabko ek baraabar selary milti he
 In the private sector, hard work and sourness is more, earnings are less
 in naujavaanon ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki 50 rupee se 1000 rupee form bharne ke liye ja rahe hai
 The test takes place but the result does not come
 65 pratishat yuva sarkari naukari chahta he
 Only 7 percent want to work in private
 19 pratishat aise hai jo apana bijness karnaa chaahate hai
 It says the survey of CSDS which has been done about the youth, which is going to be printed in the form of the book later
 2007 main sarkari naukari chaahane vaale 62 pratishat the, 2016 main badhkar 65 pratishat ho gaye
 In 2007, 48 percent of the youth of big cities wanted government jobs, in 2016 their number increased to 62 percent
 2007 main privet naukari kii chaah rakhane vaale 24 fisadi yuva the, 2016 main inaki sankhya 10 pratishat rah gai
 Big cities are also in decline
 2007 main 17 fisadi the, 2016 main 10 fisadi par aa gaye
 There is nothing wrong in wanting a government job
 kyon nahin sarkari naukari kii chaah rakhni chahie
 The government has 24 lakh vacancies
 wo kyon nahin kah detii he ki sarkari naukari mat kiijie
 What is worse than wanting a government job
 susheel mahapatra ne sarkari naukari kii taiyaari karne vaale naujavaanon se baat kii he
 Job conditions are becoming difficult
 sirf bharat hi nahin, naukari ke sthayitv kaa mudda har desh kaa mudda he
 Now see how the life of the youth is at stake
 kya aap jaanate hai ki bihar main 68500 shikshak 2012 se pariksha paas kar niyukti kaa intazaar kar rahe hai
 Of these, a merit list of about 17000 was made in 2012, not all of them have been appointed in that list
 53, 500 shikshakon kii merit list nahin bani he
 If they do not get a job by 2019, then the exam they have passed will be canceled
 saat saal tak intazaar karne ke baad inaki zindagi barbaad ho jaaegi
 Have any ministers told you on their twitter, you see, minister people tweet such information less, half the time line is of jubilee and death anniversary so that they are seen taking inspiration every day
 2012 main bihar state teacher eligibility test kii pariksha paas karne ke baad bie bied or tet ke number ke aadhaar par inkaa rank taiyaar hona chahie tha or jis bhi hai skool main jahaan jagah he vahaan bahaali ho jaani chahie thi
 But the merit list of 17000 was made and the rest was not
 53,500 shikshakon kii saans ataki hui he ki agar bahaali kii prakriya jaldi shuru nahin hui to unke riselt kii manyata samaapt ho jaaegi or ve teacher banane kii paatrata jivan bhar ke liye kho denge
 He agitated many times
 is mantri se mili, us mantri se mili, vidhansabha main prashn uthaa magar aashwaasan or bhaashan ke baad sab kuch saamaanya ho gaya
 According to these teachers, the posts of 19000 teachers in Bihar schools are vacant
 bihar main 5700 skool bina shikshakon ke chal rahe hai
 Then why are they not being given jobs
 kya kisi ko parvaah nahin he ki rajya kii hi pariksha paas karne ke baad in shikshakon kii naukari kii paatrata agle saal samaapt ho jaaegi? 8 lakh se adhik abhyarthiyon ne is pariksha ke liye form bhare the or sabane dedh sau rupee jamaa kiye the
 What happened to this money? 68500 paas hue the

 mahilaon kii aazaadee ko lekar saudi arab lagaataar apane niyamon main tabdiliyaan kar rahaa he
 Now King Mohammed bin Salman has decided to allow Saudi Arabian women to visit the stadium from next year to watch the match
 saudi samaaj ke aadhunikeekaran or arthvyavastha ko badhaava dene ke makasad se ye kadam uthaaya gaya he
 Major initiative on the freedom of women, this step of Saudi King is being considered as another important step towards giving freedom to women
 isse pehle saudi arab main mahilaon ke gaadi chalaane par pratibandh ko hataaya gaya tha
 The Sports Authority of Saudi Arabia said preparations would begin at the three stadiums so that they would be ready for the arrival of women from early 2018
 praadhikaran ne kaha ki parivartanon ke hisse ke rup main stadium ke andar restaraan, cafe or monitor screen lagaai jaaengi
 It was decided last month that women will be allowed to drive from June next year
 saath hi saudi main ek baar phir concert shuru ho gaye hai or jald hi vahaan cinema bhi lautne vaale hai
 Only last week, King had said that the return of Kinarmist Islam is an important part of his plans to modernize the country
 haal kii ghoshnaaon ke baavjood, mahilaon ko abhi bhi saudi main gambhir pratibandhon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Even today in Saudi, women have to follow a strict dress code
 pehali khel sangh adhyakshhal hi main saudi main pehali baar kisi mahila ko khel sangh kaa adhyaksh banaaya gaya he
 Princess Reema Bint Bandar bin Sultan has been appointed the president of the multi-sport association
 yah pehali baar he jab desh main koi mahila khel sangh kii adhyaksh bani he
 An official said on the condition of anonymity that Princess Reema is the first woman to preside over the men and women sports association
 isse pehle agast 2016 main bhi unhen mantrimandal main khel mantralay ke baraabar jagah di gai thi
 On the allegations of Congress spending Rs 10,000 crore in the election campaign of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Narendra Modi has said that he is ready to conduct an inquiry with any government agency and this investigation should be completed within 30 days
 unhone is sambandh main khud chunaav ayog ko patr likhane kii peshkash kii he
 Modi, the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, termed the allegations of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi as false in which he said that farmers' land was given to industrial houses at cheaper rates
 ek channel ko die intervyuu main gujarat ke mukhyamantri se congress netaaon khaskar anand sharma ke is aarope ke bare main sawaal kiya gaya tha ki unhone is chunaav main prachaar par kul 10,000 karod rupee kharch kiye hai or isamen se 90 pratishat paisa kaala dhan he
 Modi replied that Rs 10,000 crore is a big amount
 sarkaar ke paas sabhi agenciyaan hai
 They should ask whose money it is
 yah kahaan se aayaa or yah kahaan kharch kiya gaya
 He said that an inquiry should be conducted within 30 days to present the truth to the country
 modi ne kaha ki agar aaropon kaa koi aadhaar he to sharma ko chunaav ayog ko likhnaa chahie tha taaki ayog bhi yah pataa lagane ke liye jaanch kara le ki bijepi ne prachaar par kitna kharch kiya or isamen kitna kaala dhan he
 Rahul ji tea is definitely not combed
 In the interview, the Chief Minister of Gujarat said that if there is any problem with the model code of conduct in ordering the investigation by the government, then i will write to the Election Commission myself and say that if the government wants to investigate this matter i will not mind
 kisaanon kii jameen sasti daron par bade audyogic gharaanon ko dene ke rahul gandhi ke aaropon par modi ne kaha ki yah jhooth he or raajnneetik vichaar se prerit he
 Referring to Tata's Nano car project, he said that not even an inch of land was given free
 rahul gandhi kii tippanee modi ganje ko bhi kanghee bech sakate hai par modi ne kaha ki unhone kabhi kanghee nahin bechi lekin chaay jarur bechi he
 Every hand robbed, every lip lied
 He said that Rahul Gandhi's statement shows the fear spread within the Congress that Modi can also do so
 congress par hamalaa bolte hue modi ne kaha ki unka naaraa hona chahie har haath lut, har hont jhooth
 a few years ago, when asked about the controversy over not accepting the request of a Muslim cleric to wear a cap on his head, Modi said, "if wearing a hat is seen as a sign of unity then i have never seen Mahatma Gandhi , Did not see Sardar Patel or Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru wearing such a hat
 unhone kaha ki darasal bhartiya raajnneeti main ek vikruti ai he ki tushtikaran ke liye kuch bhi karo
 Along with the Quran, the computer leader also said, "my job is to honor all sects, respect all traditions
" par meri jo parampara he usko bhi sweekaar karnaa
 i live by my traditions, respect the traditions of all
 isliye main yah topi pahanakar photo nikaalkar logon kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne kaa kaam nahin kar saktaa
 But if someone hoists someone's hat, then he should be punished with the most severe, i keep such an idea in mind
 muslimon ke utthan kii vakaalat karte hue unhone kaha ki meraa maananaa he ki topi pahanane waalon ke haath main quran ke saath unke paas computer bhi hone chahie
 In the context of the death of the Muslim community in the 2002 riots in Gujarat, Modi remarked a few days back that if the ant also dies, it hurts if the child of the dog comes under the car
 is tippanee par uthe vivaad par bhi pratikriya dete hue modi ne kaha ki unhone kisi ko kute kaa baccha nahin kaha tha balki keval apni samvednaa ko vyakt karne ke liye yah baat kahi thi
 Putting this argument in a more definite manner, he said that there is a saying that even if an ant dies, it hurts
 ab agar koi kahe ki main insaan ko cheentee kah rahaa hum to yah unki samasya he
 Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan recently gave an example of the loyalty of the dog, pointing to Modi's statement that we do not want your sympathy for the elder brother of the puppy
 is par pratikriya dete hue gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne apane andaaj main kaha, kute kii vafadari kaa log udhaaharan dete hai
 If my loyalty works for the country, it is good
 unhone desh ko todane kii raajnneeti karne ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki desh ko un logon se nuksaan hota he jo jati or tushtikaran kii raajnneeti karte hai
 In Gujarat, lies do not work
 On Rahul Gandhi's pinch of bjp's balloon burst, Modi said that Congress is campaigning like this for three assembly elections in Gujarat, but what happened? On allegations of false propaganda for the development of Gujarat, Modi said that if his claims about Gujarat were false then how would the BJP consistently win in that state
 unhone kaha ki kuch log mujh par jhooth bolne, marketing ke jariye hawa banane kaa aarope lagaate hai, unhen sochna chahie ki gujarat ke bare main unka jhooth kuch vakt tak pashcham bengal, uttar pradesh yaa rajasthan main chal saktaa he lekin gujarat kii janata ke saamne nahin chal saktaa
 According to Modi, elections in Gujarat are fought on the issue of development and if political parties have courage then they should talk about development
 vampanthi shashan vaale tripura yaa bengal ke garib or berozegaron kii jindagi, bhaajapa ke shashan vaale jharkhand yaa chhattisgarh ke garibon kii jindagi se kitni alag he?kya haryana ke aspataal karnataka ke aspataalon se behatar ho gaye hai?madhya pradesh kaa bhrashtachar, punjab se kitna alag he?gujarat kaa netaa-company gathjod, pashchim bengal yaa tamilnadu se kis tarah alag he?vampanthi shashan vaale rajyon main aarthik samanta kaa koun-sa mahaprayog ho gaya? bhaajapa ke shashan vaale rajyon main nivesh or naukariyon kaa koun-sa vasant utar aayaa he? sarvasamaveshi congress ne koun-sa adarsh prashasan diya?in sawaalon ko uthaane kaa yah sabase sahi vakt he
 Because the people of India have seen governments of all colors such as red, saffron, green, blue, white
 khud se yah poochna jaruri he ki kisi siyaasi vichaar kii chunavi safalataa se yaa vifaltaa se hamaari jindagi par kya fark padataa he? vyaavhaarik rup se logon ke jivan main antar sirf is baat se aata he ki chunaav se kisi sarkaar nikali
 Statue of Lenin keep collapsing, keep standing effigies of Shiva and Sardar Patel or keep decorating Ambedkar Park
 ek sanvaidhanik loktantr main koi rajnatik vichaar agar ek acchhee sarkaar nahin de saktaa to uski haisiyat kisi kabyli sanghathan se zyada haragij nahin, jo virdohi kii murtiyon dhahaane yaa apni banane par kendrit he, logon kii jindagi banane yaa behatar karne par nahin
 There are two reasons why governments of different views are found to be the same in the matter of giving their rights to the people: First, there is a difference between the government and the ideal government
 aamtaur par rajnatik vichaardhaaraon ke paas sarkaar yaa gavarnence kaa koi nayaa vichaar nahin hota
 For example, in the last four years, every year, from one twelfth prescription to some medical and judicial examinations have been leaked
 karmchaaree chayan ayog kii pariksha kaa parchaa li isi kram main he
 Every year, the hard work of millions of youth is lost, but the government of any ideology has no new idea to make the examinations secure
 dashakon ke baad desh ke 22 rajyon or kareeb 60 fisadi jidipi par ek hi dal (gathbandhan) ke shashan ke baavjood bainkon se lekar kheti tak or aspataal se adaalat tak sab jagah kaath kii puraani handiyaan nae rang-rogan ke saath chadhaai ja rahi hai
 There is no qualitative change anywhere
 duusari—sarkaron ko samvidhan kii rajnatik nirpekshata se khaasi takalif hoti he
 The constitution created a long system for governments to undergo a variety of institutional tests
 sarkarein in sansthaaon ko kamjor karti hai yaa phir in arajanatik sansthaaon par rajnatik vichaar thopane kii koshish karti hai taaki duusare vichaar kaa khauf dikhaakar satta main rahaa ja sake
 Not surprisingly, governments of mixed political views have been more productive than domineering governments of one party
 ve shaayad koi ek vichaar dikhaakar bharamaane kii sthiti main nahin thim
 Politics is now a permanent opposition of the people
 rajaneta andarkhaane janata se ek ladaai ladate hai
 Their biggest fear is that people may not understand what they should understand
 netaaon kii yah jang samaj, tark or prashn ke khilaaf he
 Questions will naturally be asked of his government which is concrete and tangible
 amoort vichaardhaara se yah koun poochne ja rahaa he ki bank main ghotaale kyon ho rahe hai? logon ko acchhee sarkaar chahie, vichaar to vichaarkon or prachaarkon ke liye hai
 Questions create courage and fear is born out of confusion
 bhram kaa charam hi raajnneeti kaa swarna yug he
 People should consider the rope as a snake and what else does the idea require from the government, politics? Keep in mind that the statue of Lenin was demolished, it was made out of public money on public land and the statue of Patel is being built, Taxpayers' money is invested
 chunaav main ham sarkaar chunate hai, vichaar nahin
 If we want to get strong and accountable governments in place of subversive or impotent ideas, will every five years have to do with each government what the people of Tripura did after 25 years with the Manik government? ** patna ames prabandhan kii ore se mukadmaa darj hone ke baad jeenyu chaatr sangh ke purv adhyaksh kanhaiya kumaar ne kaha ki ye doctor yaa ames prabandhan ne nahin balki bhaajapa ke kendriya netritv ke ishaare par maamla darj karaayaa gaya hai

 See how bjp's Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi was tweeting on the matter, but you saw a condolence message or tweet that Modi was martyred while competing with criminals on their work
 dekhie doctor bhagwaan ke rup hote hai unase meraa aagrah hai ki wo raajnneetik mohara naa bane isse pehle inhone dilli main vakeelon ko mere kilaaf aise bhadakaayaa
 Similarly, Bihar's Health Minister's hyperactivity at AIIMS, an autonomous institution, was at the behest of the central leadership
 kanhaiya filhal begusarai main party ke kaarykram main bhaag le rahe hai or unka kahana hai ki us din bahes zarur hui thi lekin kisi ke saath hathapayee yaa gaali galoj jaisi koi baat nahin hui lekin santhaan ke logon par is praathmiki ke liye dabaav daalaa gaya 
 Kanhaiya said that despite all the tricks against me in Delhi, he had to face his mouth and now this conspiracy has been hatched in view of the elections here, see how he will have to see defeat here too
