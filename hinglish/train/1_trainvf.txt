 It is a matter of ancient times that once a poor Brahmin lived in a village
 vah brahman niyamit rup se shri vishnu kaa pujan kiya karata tha
 Pleased with his worship and devotion, Lord Vishnu appeared to him and asked the Brahmin to ask for his wish
 brahman nelakshmi ji kaa nivaasapane ghar main hone kii ichha jaahir kii
 Hearing this, Shri Vishnu told the Brahmin the path of attainment of Lakshmi
 jisamen shri hari ne bataaya ki mandir ke saamne ek stri aati he jo yahaan aakar upale thapati he
 You invite her to come to your home and that woman is Goddess Lakshmi
 devi lakshmi ji ke tumhaare ghar aane ke baad tumhaara ghar dhan or dhaany se bhar jayega
 Saying this Shri Vishnu went away
 agle din vah subah chaar baje hi mandir ke saamne baith gaya
 When Lakshmi ji came to set up the Brahmin, she requested him to come to her house
 brahman kii baat sunakar lakshmi ji samaj gai ki yah sabavishnu ji ke kehanese hua he
 Lakshmi ji told the Brahmin that you fast Mahalakshmi, by fasting for 16 days and praying to the moon at night on the sixteenth day, your desire will be fulfilled

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday that there was no plan to visit Gujarat
 nitish ke mutabik vaise bhi abhi gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav ke kaarykram kii ghoshnaa nahin hui
 The Chief Minister said that the decision on all these things is to be taken by party president Sharad Yadav
 patna main 'mukhyamantri janata darbar main' kaarykram ke baad patrakaron se charchaa karte hue unhone bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang ko ek baar phir doharaate hue kaha ki yah bihar ke jan-jan kii hi aawaaj nahin he balki yahaan ke logon kaa haq bhi he
 When asked questions related to campaigning in the Gujarat elections by the journalists, the Chief Minister did not give any direct answer
 unhone in prashnon se bachate hue sirf itnaa kaha ki abhi chunaav kaa karykram hi tay nahin he, prachaar karne koun jayega or koun nahin jayega yah party ke adhyaksh ko faisla karnaa he
 He cited many of his future programs and said that much more remains to be done in Bihar itself
 unhone kaha ki ganga nadi ke lagaataar pradooshit hone par bhi chintaa prakat karte hue kaha ki ganga main milane vaali nadiyon ko bhi pradooshan mukt bananaa hoga
 He believed that due to excess of Ganga pollution, there has also been a shortage of organisms like dolphins

 During this, he gave information on the target of Jahan Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
 vahiin ye bhi bataaya ki sarkaar kaa aagaamee agenda kya he
 Hardeep Singh Puri said that by 2024, India will not only be a $ 5 trillion economy, but also the cleanest country in the world
 isse pehle unhone swatchta mishan ke tahat kiye gaye sarkaar ke kaamon kaa bhi bakhaan kiya
 Hardeep Puri said that the government had targeted to build 65 lakh domestic or private toilets and 5 lakh public toilets and this has been completed
 unhone bataaya ki 66 lakh gharelu yaa nijee toilet banaae ja chuke hai or 5 lakh se zyada public toilet kaa nirmaan ho chukaa he, jo ki target se zyada he
 The force cannot be said to be defecation-free when Hardeep Singh Puri was questioned that leaders and officials are vying to declare their areas open defecation free, when the reality is different
 is par unhone jawaab diya ki kuch log ati-utsaah main aisa kar dete hai, lekin jabardastee kisi ilaake ko khule main shouch mukt nahin bataaya ja saktaa he
 If this happens, then later it opens its pole, because there is a mechanism to assess it
 apane bayaan main hardip singh puri ne bataaya ki shahari ilaakon main aisa nahin he or sarkaar jis target ko lekar chali thi use paa liya he
 With this claim, Hardeep Singh Puri also put the target of the next five years on the stage of safigiri
 unhone bataaya ki 2024 tak bharat duniya kaa sabase svachh desh hoga

 In it, he said that in the year 2007, we started our trip to Flipkart with modest resources
 is dauraan safar kathin bhi rahaa, lekin hamen safalataa bhi mili
 Earlier this year we partnered with Walmart
 wo hamaare behtareen partner hai or main hamaare achche bhavishya ke liye ashaavadi hum
 Let us know that on Tuesday, Flipkart Group CEO Binny Bansal resigned from his post
 isaki jaankaree company ne ek bayaan jari kar di
 The company said that Binny has been an important part of the company since its inception
 binni bansal kaa yah istipha aise samay main aayaa he, jab unke khilaaf personal missconduct karne ke aarope main jaanch chal rahi thi
 In his letter to the Flipkart Family, Binny stated that he wanted to remain in the current role for a few more quarters after the deal with Walmart
 haalanki haal main hui kuch vyaktigat ghatnaon kii vajah se unhen jald istipha dene pad gaya
 "these incidents relate to the claim of serious personal misconduct made against me," he said
 aaropon ne mujhe chakit kar diya or main inhen sire khaarij karata hum
 The time has been challenging for me and my family since this incident
 mujhe chintaa thi ki ye ghatana meri company or meri team ke liye pareshaani khadi kar sakati he
 Keeping all these things in mind, i thought it better to resign from the post of Chairman and Group CEO
 binni ne kaha ki main company main ek bada shareholder bana rahoonga or board of doirectors ke sadsy ke rup main apni sevaayen jari rakhuunga
 i am convinced that the company is in the hands of experienced leaders like Kalyan, Anant and Sameer
 padhein walmart kii binni bansal ke istife par safaiunake khilaaf yah jaanch personal missconduct ke aarope ko lekar kii ja rahi thi
 Walmart said in its statement that Binny has outright rejected these allegations
 haalanki iske baad bhi yah hamaari jimmedaari thi ki ham is maamle main jaanch karen
 Walmart further said that he did not find any evidence against Bansal in the investigation
 lekin isamen faisle ko lekar kai or khamiyaan saamne jarur ain
 There was also the issue of transparency
 isko lekar binni kaa jo ravaiya rahaa
 Seeing that, we have accepted his resignation
 walmart kii taraf se jari bayaan main sachin bansal ke istipha dene ke liye personal missconduct ko vajah bataaya gaya he
 Please tell here that serious personal misconduct can mean a case of misconduct on a personal level
 jisamen karmchaariyon ke saath durvyavhaar jaisi ghatnaayen shaamil ho sakati hai
 Explain that Walmart has bought a 77 percent stake in Flipkart

 It has also had an impact on TV actress Nupur Alankar with ordinary people
 is ghotaale ne unki jindagi main tufaan laa diya he, yahaan tak ki nupur ko apana guzaara karne ke liye apane gahane tak bechney pad rahe hai
 Nupur Alankar himself told this in an interview given to the Times of India
 apni pareshaaniyon ke bare main nupur alankaar (nupur Alankar) ne bataaya, 'ghar par paise na hone ke kaaran, sabhi acount fries karadene kii vajah se mere paas gahane bechney ke alaava or koi rasta nahin tha
 Even i borrowed 3,000 thousand rupees from my fellow actor
 kisi duusare ne mujhe 500 rupee transfar kiye
 Apart from this, i also borrowed 50,000 thousand rupees from my friends
 abhi tak yah bhi nahin pataa chal paaya he ki is samasya kaa samaadhaan kab hoga or hamen dar bhi he ki kahin ham apana paisa na kho den
 During the interview Nupur Alankar said, 'I am going through a big financial crisis
 duusare bainkon main bhi mere khate hai, lekin maine un sab ko is bank main transfar kar diya tha
 What i knew was that my family and my deposits would get stuck in the bank like this

 Nupur Alankar further said, 'the worst thing is that i am not even in a position to take a loan right now
 jis pal maine telecolers se kaha ki meraa khaataa piemasi bank main he to unhone usee vakt phone kaat diya

 If there is any truth in Modi's statement, then i am ready to give up public life
 'aapako bataa den ki neshnal channel doordarshan par modi kaa intervyuu puraa nahin dikhaane kaa aarope laga he
 There are many parts of the interview that were not aired
 pehle modi dwaara priyanka gandhi ko 'beti' samaan kehane vaale hisse ko prasaarit nahin karne kii baat saamne ai
 Now it has come to light that Modi's statement regarding Ahmed Patel has not been shown
 modi ne is intervyuu main kaha tha, 'ahamed bhai mere achche doston main se the, par ab nahin
 i had a personal relationship with him and wanted him to remain so
 lekin ab meri baat unase nahin hoti
 He does not pick up my phone
 'modi ke beti vaale bayaan par bavaaldarasal, narendra modi ne kuch dinon pehle hi doordarshan ko ek intervyuu diya tha jisamen priyanka se jude kuch sawaal bijepi ke piem ummidavaar se puche gaye the lekin tivi par modi ke is saakshaatkaar se priyanka par modi ke jawaab ko prasaarit nahin kiya gaya tha
 Technical problems were cited as the reason
 intervyuu ke us hisse ke bare main pehle khabar ai ki modi ne priyanka ko apni beti jaisi kaha tha lekin baad main bijepi offis kii ore se us andekhee clip ko beparda kar safai di gai ki modi ne aisa kuch bhi nahin kaha he
 In a very different way on this statement of Modi, Priyanka Gandhi reminded that she is the daughter of Rajiv Gandhi

 Siddharth Kaul was in good form
 unhone is ranjai sijan main do match khelkar 8 wicket bhi liye the, lekin chayankartaaon ne unhen bhartiya team se baahar kar diya he
 The team was announced for the tour of South Africa, it was not given to Rahul, who played shami-shardul in the ODI team, and is ignoring the talented player like selector Lokesh Rahul from the ODI team again and again, he has done this, But this is more surprising because Rahul has played 61 and 89 runs in two matches so far in the ongoing T20 series against Sri Lanka, but Still selectors did not place all the Chaukate Gandhi to South Africa to one-day team

 As of 19 December 2019, 100 times internet has been shut down in the country, 6 times in 2014 and 14 times in 2015
 yah jaankaree dene vaali software freedom lau centre kii report ke mutabik 2018 main 134 baar internet band kiya gaya
 The country and the people have to bear the economic loss of this internet shutdown exercise
 aamtaur par hinsa kii ashanka, bigadati kanoon-vyavastha yaa afvaahon par lagaam lagane ke liye internet band karaayaa jaataa he
 Against the Citizenship Amendment Act these days, internet is being shut down in dozens of cities of the country to curb rumors and prevent the gathering of protesters
 lekin is tarah kii pabandi kaa sabase zyada nuksaan un aam logon ko uthaanaa padataa he jinaki jindagi internet aadhaarit bijness par tiki hoti he jaise taxi or travel oparator
 On December 20, hundreds of people operating an aggregator connected taxi like ola-uber did not get customers due to internet shutdown in Ghaziabad
 internet band hone ke chalate unhen chauraahey yaa coloniyon main khadey rahakar sawari kaa intjaar karnaa padaa
 Similarly, many small businessmen suffered
 isi tarah saikadon log atm thap hone se cash nahin nikaal sake
 Could not work in banks either
 mote taur par dekha jaae to i-commers, paryaton, ity sarvice, banking, shiksha, swasthya sevaaon par internet band hone kaa sabase bada asar padataa he
 The telecom sector is at a disadvantage because its capacity is not utilized as seen in the case of Kashmir

 According to the report released by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations on internet blackout, 16315 hours of internet was on the internet in India from 2012 to 2017 and this led to the economy falling 3
 04 arab dollar kaa nuksaan jhelana padaa
 During the Patidar movement in Gujarat, there was a long ban on the Internet
 tab yani 2015 main gujarat main chah baar main 528 ghante internet band rahaa or isse 112
 There was a loss of $ 96 million
 isamen bhi sabase zyada nuksaan surat or ahmedabad ko hua
 India's Internet economy will touch $ 250 billion by 2020, which is 7% of GDP
 5 fisadi hoga
 E-commerce and financial services lead the Internet economy
 ek survey ke mutabik bhartiya mobile par 45 fisadi vakt manoranjan, 34 fisadi search or soshal media par sandesh bhejne main or 4 fisadi shopping main bitaate hai
 But now the Internet has become the most important resource for businesses and industries
 internet jitna vidhwans ke liye istemaal ho rahaa he usase zyada aarthik gatividhiyon ke liye ho rahaa he
 It is the responsibility of the government to maintain law and order during civil demonstrations
 uske paas nishedhaatmak karrwai karne ke tamaam upaay hai
 But first, the dissemination of information causes a lot of harm to the common people, who have nothing to do with the performance
 unki roji-roti par sankat aa jaataa he
 The government should create an efficient and effective system for law and order so that law-abiding people do not suffer

 During remand, ED did not confront me with anyone
 24 or 30 oktober ke bich inhone 3 gavaahon ko saman kiya, lekin wo nahin aae
 They are saying that i will come out and influence the witnesses, but i am in custody, so why are they not confronting me? When the witnesses were in contact with you, why not call them first? The excuse behind this was that my remand could be increased under the guise of questioning
 2018 main darj karaae gaye bayanon par ab poochtacha karne kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 "all the charges and arguments of the ED on flight risk, impact on witnesses and erasure of evidence have been dismissed," Sibal said

 Why in custody then? Sibal said that ED did not confront anyone with me even during remand
 24 or 30 oktober ke bich ED ne 3 gavaahon ko saman kiya, lekin gavaah nahin aae
 Sibal said that ED only wants to keep p Chidambaram in jail for a long time
 ED ne mujhase se poochtacha kyon nahi kii jab pi chidambaram castady main the, ab vah kah rahe he ki vah poochtacha karenge

 uttarakhand main thand prachand rup le chuki he
 While more than three feet of snow has been accumulated due to continuous snowfall in the mountainous districts of the entire state, cold strong winds have kept people imprisoned in the plains or on daily basis using fire and bonfire
 Forced to live life
 abhi tak puure pradesh main 6 mautein is prachand thand kii vajah se ho chuki hai jiname mahilaayein bhi shaamil hai
 Aaj Tak's team came out in Dehradun city to take stock of how cold it is and how much trouble is being faced by the common man and the travelers coming to Uttarakhand
 shanivaar raat kareeb saadhe baje jagah dehradun kaa railway stesan pahunchane par, ye maaloom hua ki kis tarah yatri pareshaani kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Due to the outbreak of fog in the entire North India, trains are being delayed for many hours, the problem of which can be seen clearly on the face of the passengers at the station of Dehradun
 log bina kisi aag-alaav ke kisi tarah se thand se maano muqabla karte nazar aa rahe hai
 Talking to a person from Patna, he came to know that he has been standing in the open sky with his family for the last 6 hours, trusting that when his train will arrive and he will somehow reach his home
 magar jistrain seunhen janaa he vah dehradun hi 12 ghante der se pahunchi thi or uske baad 5 ghante abhi or baaki hai use dubaara chalane main
 Similar was the situation with NR Gopal, who is traveling by train after 10 years
 unki maane to unako lagata tha ki ab sab kuch badal gaya hoga
 The country may have changed, the facilities must have been good, but since today they told that they had to be disappointed
 unki maane to koharaa padana to prakritik baat he, jisko ham nahin roak sakate
 But can the railways not even arrange for a fire or any such room that small children and women can save themselves from this severe cold
 aisa hi haal ek maa kaa bhi he jo kisi tarah se apane anchal main apane 2 saal ke bachche ko chupaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The cold that does not ask whether its outbreak will affect the child or women and the elderly
 baharhaal na railway ne yatriyon ke liye kuch sochaa or na hi uttarakhand prashasan ne
 The station master also freed himself after saying that we have not received orders to provide any such facility
 railway stesan se nikalne ke baad ham sidhaa dehradun ke aiesabiti pahunche, jahaan yatriyon ko sadak par khadey hone ke alaava koi chaara nahi tha, kyonki bas adde ke andar kuch jagah nahi thi or baahar koi bhi vyavastha nahi thi
 In order to avoid the frost constantly falling on the head, the passengers had to go to Punjab to take the help of flyover, under which they could not get rid of the cold, but the frost was definitely saved
 tej hawaaon ke bich khadey yatri sirf is baat kaa intjaar kar rahe the ki kisi tarah koi bas mil jaye to wo apane gantavy kii ore ravaanaa ho saken
 There was a similar situation for the auto drivers standing there, if they believe that in the government staff papers, it shows that bonfire has been arranged in the entire city, but it does not appear anywhere on the ground
 bas kisi tarah se raat guzaar rahe hai, kyunki ghar chalaane ke liye auto chalaanaa to band nahi kiya ja saktaa
 Taking a review of the entire city, one thing came to the fore that there might not be any place, but every police checkpost was definitely burnt, where police personnel were seen even while removing their cold

 'kaaravaan guzar gaya, gubaar dekhte rahe!'swapn there phool se,meet chubhe shul se,lut gayi singaar sabhi baag ke babul se,or ham khadey-khadey bahaar dekhte rahekaaravaan guzar gaya, gubaar dekhte rahe!neend bhi khuli na thi ki hai dhoop dhal gai,paanv jab talak uthe ki zindagi phisal gai,paat-paat jhar gayi ki shaakh-shaakh jal gai,chaah to nikal saki na, par umr nikal gai,geet ashq ban gaye,chand ho dafan gaye,saath ke sabhi diai dhuaan-dhuaan pahan gayi,or ham jhuke-jhuke,mode par ruke-rukeumr ke chadhaav kaa utaar dekhte rahekaaravaan guzar gaya, gubaar dekhte rahe
 What was the beauty that the flower rose to love, what was the beauty of seeing the mirror rise to the ground and the sky to the side, holding the liver to see what was found, one day but here, some such wind went away, looted the bud- Kali was suffocated street-street, and we looted, beaten and beaten, watched the breath of breath, the caravan passed by, kept watching
 haath the mili ki julf chaand kii sanvaar don,hont the khule ki har bahaar ko pukaar don,dard tha diya gaya ki har dukhi ko pyaar don,or saans yun ki swarg bhumi par utaar don,ho sakaa na kuch magar,shaam ban gai sahar,vah uthi lahar ki dah gayi kile bikhar-bikhar,or ham dare-dare,nir nayan main bhare,odhakar kafan, pade mazaar dekhte rahekaaravaan guzar gaya, gubaar dekhte rahe!maang bhar chali ki ek, jab nai-nai kiran,dholken dhumuk uthin, thumak uthe charan-charan,shor much gaya ki lo chali dulhan, chali dulhan,gaanv sab umad padaa, bahak uthe nayan-nayan,par tabhi zehar bhari,gaaj ek vah giri,poonch gaya sindur taar-taar hui chunari,or ham ajaan se,dur ke makaan se,palki liye hue kahaar dekhte rahe

 or ab rafee sahab kii aawaaj main ye rachana a youth living in Sector-8 of Sector-20 police station area in Noida committed suicide by putting a fan on his house in the early hours of Thursday due to mental stress
 police ne shav ko kabje main lekar postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 Inspector Rajvir Singh Chauhan, in-charge of Sector-20 police station, said that Jitendra (28 years) son Ram Avtar, who lives in Sector 8, got a fan on his house on Thursday morning
 unhone bataaya ki uske ghar waalon ne use jila aspataal main bhartee karaayaa, jahaan par doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 He said that the police reached the spot after receiving information about the incident and took the body in possession and sent it for postmortem
 thana prabharee ne bataaya ki police aatmahatya ke kaarnon kaa pataa laga rahi he
 This time the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has not fielded many elderly leaders including LK Advani, who has been called the iron man of the party
 75 varsh paar kar chukenataon kaa tikat kaatane ke liye bijepi ke sheersh netritv ne khud pahal kii
 Although it was reported in the media after the party meeting earlier that the elderly leaders will fight the party, but they will not be given any responsibility in the government
 magar party ne ab bujurg netaaon ko maidan main utaarne kii jagah unhen aaraam dene kaa faisla kiya
 BJP sources say that the responsibility of persuading such elderly leaders of the party not to contest the elections was entrusted to the organization general secretary Ramlal
 kaha gaya ki vah party ke sambandhit varisht netaaon se sampark kar anurodh karanki vah chunaav ladane kii jagah aaraam karen
 If there is no name in the list, the wrong message of disrespecting the seniors will not go on among the public and party supporters, for this, these elderly leaders should be issued a statement in advance that they will not contest the election
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki party mahasachiv ram laal ne bujurg netaaon se sampark sadhana shuru kiya
 Ramlal met leaders like Shanta Kumar and Kalraj Mishra, including Murali Manohar Joshi
 isamen calraj mishra or shanta kumaar saarvajanik rup se yah ghoshnaa karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaye ki vah chunaav nahin ladenge
 But LK Advani refused
 jis din ummidavaaron kii suchi aane vaali thi, us din pehle hi calraj mishra ne twit kar kah diya tha ki vah chunaav nahin ladenge
 Kalraj Mishra is currently in charge of Haryana
 adwani ke kareebi bataate hai ki vah tikat katane se nahin, balki tikat katane ke taur-tareekon se aahat hai
 He was not approached by any big leader and asked not to contest from Gandhinagar
 karibiyon ke mutabik unhen dukh is baat kaa nahin ki adwani sansad main nahin honge, balki unka tikat jis dhang se kaata gaya, usase dukhi hai
 Talking about other elderly leaders, MP Hukum Dev Narayan has been given ticket for not contesting elections
 jabaki uttarakhand ke bijepi netaa khanduri kii beti pehle se hi raajnneeti main he
 Among the other elders, Koshiyari and Kariya Munda have also been ticketed by the party
 madhya pradesh kii pehali suchi main loksabhaa adhyaksh or indore saansad sumitra mahajan kaa bhi naam nahin he
 Congress leader Gurudas Kamat said on Monday that Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel should have resigned much earlier

 Biplab Kumar Deb, the young Chief Minister of Tripura, is constantly in the limelight not for his work but for his statements
 wo kabhi mahabharat kaal main internet hone kii baat karte hai, to kabhi yuvaaon ko sarkari naukari ke peeche bhaagna chhodkar paan kii dukaan kholane kii salaah dete hai
 He has not even had two months to take over as the Chief Minister, but his long list of controversial statements has been prepared
 unhone pichley ek hafte main hi chah se zyada vivaadit bayaan die, jinako lekar soshal media par unki jamkar khinchaai ho rahi he
 Not only this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also summoned him, but his rhetoric has not stopped
 vah pichley ek hafte se lagaataar ek ke baad ek vivaadit bayaan de rahe hai
 Let's know what kind of controversial statements he made in the last one week
 
 
 
 
 1
 In the Mahabharata era, the Internet and Satellite Biplab Kumar Deb gave a shocking new scientific theory about the Internet, claiming that the Internet was also in the era of Mahabharata and it was used then
 yuva mukhyamantri biplab deb ne yah bayaan ek saarvajanik kaarykram ke dauraan guwahati main diya tha
 During this time he said, "india has been using the Internet since ages
 mahabharat main sanjay ne netraheen hote hue bhi dhritarashtra ko yuddh ke maidan kaa haal sunaaya tha
 Which happened due to internet and technology
 '' bharat ko digital kii disha main aage badhaane ke liye piem modi kii prashansa karte hue unhone yah bhi daawa kiya ki mahabharat yug main satlite bhi maujuud the
 2
 dyna heden kii khubsuurati nahin ai samajhatripura ke mukhyamantri biplab kumaar deb ne dyna heden ko 1997 main miss world khitaab jeetne par sawaal uthaaya or antarrashtriya saundarya pratiyogitaaon ko chhalaava bataaya tha
 Deb had said, "whoever took part in international beauty pageants returned after winning
 lagaataar paanch varshon tak hamane miss world / miss univers ke taj jite
 Diana Hayden also won
 kya aapako lagata he ki unhen taj jeetna chahie tha?’’iske ulat unhone aishwarya kii tarif karte hue kaha tha,''ham mahila ko devi lakshmi or saraswati ke rup main dekhte hai
 If Aishwarya becomes Miss World, it is okay
 wo sahi myne main bhartiya mahilaon kii numaaindgi karti hai, lekin main dyna heden kii khubsuurati nahin samaj paa rahaa hum
 He was strongly condemned on this
 dyna heden ne bhi biplab par palatwaar kiya
 3
 paan kii dukaan khol len noujvanshanivaar ko biplab deb ne agartala main apane soobe ke naujavaanon ko salaah dete hue kaha ki wo naukari ke liye netaaon ke peeche na dauden, balki apana khud kaa kaam shuru karen
 He said, "young people run after parties for years to get a government job and waste precious time of their lives
 agar yahi yuva partiyon ke peeche bhaagane ke bajaay apni paan kii dukaan shuru karata, to uske khate main paanch lakh rupee jamaa ho chuke hote
 He was severely criticized for this
 4
 After graduation, Biplab Kumar Deb, while speaking at a program on the subject 'role of Veterinary Profession in Life Reform' in Agartala, the capital of Tripura, gave advice to the youth that all were taken aback
 unhone kaha, ''har ghar main ek gaay honi chahie
 The milk here is 50 rupees a liter
 koi graduate he or naukari ke liye 10 saal se gum rahaa he
 Had he taken a cow, he would have deposited Rs 10 lakh in his bank account by himself
 '' unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah dharna he ki graduate kheti-kisaani nahin kar sakate, murgi paalan nahin kar sakate yaa suar paalan nahin karte, kyonki isse unka rutaba gir jayega
 Although cows can raise
 5
 Turn Civil Engineer Civil Services joinbjp leader Biplab Kumar Deb gave peculiar advice to those preparing for civil service, which became a topic of discussion on social media
 unhone kaha, ‘‘maikenical ejineering kii padhai karne vaale logon ko civil services kaa chayan nahin karnaa chahie
 Civil engineers should join civil services instead of mechanical, as they have more knowledge and experience related to management, construction and society
 unhone kaha ki pehle kala snaatak karne vaale hi civil services kii pariksha main baithte the or ab medical va ejineering karne vaale bhi civil sarvice main aa rahe hai
 He was heavily drawn for this statement
 6
 Check your mind Mamata Banerjee, Tripura Chief Minister Biplav Kumar Deb is constantly making controversial statements
 isse pehle biplav kumaar deb ne pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko dimag kii jaanch karaane kii salaah di
 He said that 'mamta Banerjee should go to the temple first
 phir kisi aspataal main dimag kii jaanch karaani chahie
 'let me tell you, Biplab Dev has given this statement after Mamata Banerjee's statement in which Mamata Banerjee described bjp's victory in Tripura as a victory in municipal elections
 7
 If the nail is put, it will be uprooted
 On Tuesday, the spoiled words of Tripura CM Biplab Kumar Deb did not stop
 unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar par koi anguli nahin uthaa saktaa, nakhun bhi nahin laga saktaa, jo nakhun lagayegaa uskaa nakhun kaat diya jayega
 Biplab Deb made this statement while expressing expectations for his government from a platform
 biplab deb ne kaha, ''meri sarkaar main aisa nahin hona chahie ki koi usamen anguli maar de, nakhun laga de
 Those who put a nail should have their nail bitten
 '' is bayaan ko lekar bhi unki tikhi aalochana ho rahi he
 8
 gautam buddha ne duniya main paidal yatra kii or diya shanti kaa sandeshbiplab deb ne kaha kigautam buddhane bharat, burma, japan, tibet or anya deshon kii paidal yatra kii thi
 However, historians have disagreed with this statement of Biplab Deb
 unhone kaha, ''yahaan ham buddha jayanti manaa rahe hai
 Gautama Buddha gave the message of peace and unity
 iske liye unhone puure bharat, burma (myanmar), japan, tibet or anya deshon kii paidal yatra kii
 India is such a land where a king becomes a Buddhist monk and gives a message of peace to the whole world
 '' vahiin, itihaaskaaron ne biplab kumaar deb ke bayaan se asahmati jataai he
 At the same time, it is feared that Gautam Buddha has traveled even as much as Biplab Deb is telling
 bhartiya sena ke javaanon ne loc paar kar 50 se zyadamphakh ke aatankiyon ko maar giraaya
 But the soldiers sent on this mission are considered one of the best in the Indian Army
 tabhi inhen 'special force' bhi kaha jaataa he
 According to an estimate, 400 to 500 personnel apply to join the Special Forces every year, but only 1 of them actually becomes a Special Commando
 ham aapako bataate hai ki kaise ek jawan special commando banataa he?jab koi shaks sena main bhartee hota he to usko special force main shaamil hone kaa vikalp diya jaataa he
 After this, on the basis of his ability, the army decides whether to send him to the Special Force or not
 20 se 22 ghante hoti he trainingspecial force main shaamil hone ke liye javaanon ko 2 maheene ke probeshan period par rakhaa jaataa he
 That is, in these two months it is tested whether the jawan can go ahead and carry out operations such as military strike
 is probeshan period ke dauraan har din 20 se 22 ghanton kii kathor training se guzarana hota he
 Like walking on the road with a fist, rolling on the road for 3 to 4 kilometers
 is dauraan use mental level par bhi torchar kiya jaataa he taaki jawan kii yah parkhaa ja sake ki jawan sirf shaareerik taur par nahin balki maansik str par bhi majboot ho
 For example, if a young man gets tired, he is given a book to read to get rid of fatigue, but in the next two hours the young man has to write a review of the book
 training main sikhaaya jaataa he kaanch khanaprobeshan ke dauraan di jane vaali training kitni kathor hoti he iskaa andaja aap isi se laga sakate hai ki javaanon ko kaanch khaane kii bhi practice karwaai jaati he
 Snakes are taught to hold hands
 iske baad unhen har din 25 kilogram tak vajan ke saath 40 kilometre bhaagna hota he
 There is also a time to complete this race
 jaise agar kisi jawan ko 10 kilometre bhaagna he to use 1 ghante 10 minute kaa time diya jaataa he
 Similarly, 2 hours 20 minutes are given for 20 kilometers, 3 hours 45 minutes for 30 kilometers and 4 hours 40 minutes for 40 kilometers
 saath hi hafte main do baar 5 kilometre or har duusare din 2
 Running 4 kilometers is also mandatory
 dushmano ko maar giraane kii honi chahie takatis training ke dauraan hi chaar str par tay kiya jaataa he ki kis jawan ko kaisaa kaam dena he
 For this, the soldiers are taught driving, demolition, battle field nursing assistance, communication
 iske baad final level par officers yah dekhte hai ki koun sa jawan driving behatar kar rahaa he, koun sa jawan dushmano ko gola-barood se udaane kaa kaam achche se karegaa, koun aisa he jo yuddh main ghayal apane saathiyon ke liye first aid dene kaa kaam kar saktaa he or koun sa jawan radio set, jeepies jaise communication divises ko behatari se chalaa paaegaa

 avaidh units ko hataane ke liye ab tak kya-kya kiye gaeh court'units ko baahar karne ke liye bijli kyon nahin kaati gai'neshnal green tribunel (engiti) ne mangalvaar ko pradooshan ko lekar dilli ke mukhya sachiv ko fatkaar lagaai he

 engiti is maamle main 20 janvari ko phir se sunwaayee karegaa
 The Delhi government told the National Green Tribunal that 29 thousand units have been shifted from residential areas to industrial areas, but the court was angry that the government has not yet removed those units which are polluting 22 thousand which are residential
 The area is running illegally

 salmaan khan apni superhit film bajrangi bhaijan main to maasoom munni ko uske mulk pakistan pahunchaa kar waapas laut aate hai lekin pakistan kaa ek shaks ab bhi aise chamatkaar kii ummid main he
 This man named Salman has been living in Pakistan away from his native Hindustan for the last 22 years
 vah apane mulk lautnaa chahta he lekin laut nahin paa rahaa
 Actually Salman's story started from the year 1984 before his birth
 aligarh ke rahane vaale salmaan ke pita vikaar ahamed kii shaadi saal 1984 mempakistanke shahar karachi main rahane vaali salama begum ke saath hui thi
 They had seven children over time
 saal 1993 main salmaan ke pita ko pakistan se phone aayaa ki unke ki unke sasur kii tabiyat behad kharaab he
 But his own health was also not well
 lihaaja salama begum sabhi bacchon ko lekar akeli pakistan chali gayi
 But when it came time for his return home, Salman's health of two years suddenly deteriorated during that time
 us vakt unke parivaaravaalon ne ye salaah di ki salmaan ko vahiin pakistan chhod jaao
 Come next time, take it
 salama begum ne bhi apane gharavaalon kii baat maanate hue biimaar salmaan ko apane maa baap ke paas chhod diya or wo khud baaki bacchon ke saath hindustan waapas aa gayi
 The real trouble started a few years later
 salmaan ke maa-baap jab bhi use ghar waapas laane kii koshish karte to passport kii dikkat unke saamne khadi ho jaati
 Because the government and administration of Hindustan said that if Salman is Hindustani then why did she leave him in Pakistan
 jabaki pakistan kaa kahana he ki jab uskaa baap hindustani he or uskaa janm bhi hindustan main hua he to ham use passport kaise den
 Salman's father says that one kidney of his son Salman has been damaged, in such a situation, if the government shows a concession, then Salman's return home
 lekin hairaani kii baat to ye he ki salmaan kii maa-baap kii shaadi ke 31 saal baad bhi uski maa salama ko ajtak hindustan kii naagarikta nahin mili he
 Now such a mother has not given up yet and she is still trying very hard to bring her son back home
 salmaan ke gharavaalon ne pehali baar saal 2013 main islamabad main bhartiya duutavas se salmaan kii vaapasi ke liye madad maangi thi
 But he got desolation from there too
 philhal salmaan ke gharavaale uski ghar vaapasi ke liye din-raat dua hi kar paa rahe hai
 Finance Minister p Chidambaram dismissed the notion that his ministry and the Reserve Bank of India were opposed to each other on the interest rate and other issues
 saath hi kaha ki ve ek duusare ke virdohi nahin hai
 He said that the government and the central bank in India also share the same relationship that happens between the government and central bank of any other country
 sarkaar hameshaa vruddhi kaa paksh rakhti he or kendriya bank apni ore se sthirataa or mudrasphiti par lagaam kii daleel detaa he
 Even if the government talks to the central bank to support the growth, it does not mean that the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank are opposed to each other
 chidambaram ne kaha ki ham apni baat rakh rahe hai, vruddhi kaa paksh rakh rahe hai, mudrasphiti par lagaam lagane kii baat kar rahe hai or iske baad jo bhi faisla ho
 He said that the relationship between the government and the central bank in India is the same as it is between these two institutions of any other country
 chidambaram ne kaha ki arabiai governor di subbarao ke saath jab vah ji-20 deshon kii baithak ke liye mexico city kii yatra par gaye the to unhone kai governron or vitt mantriyon se baat kii thi or unke sambandh bhi bilkul aise hi hai
 The Reserve Bank did not reduce interest rates in the half-yearly review of the monetary policy presented on October 30, despite the finance minister drawing up the fiscal deficit blueprint and noting the central bank's concern over government spending
 rigerv bank ke governor di subbarao ne kaha ki mudrasphiti 7
 45 per cent which is too high a level for the central bank to cut interest rates

 unhone likhaa ki dilli kii janata adhikariyon ke kaam naa karne se pareshaan he, bijepi or alji kab tak kaam karne se rokenge
 Due to the inefficiency of the officials, the public is upset, whose ration cards are not being made, the pension is not available, the public is angry, the public wants that once these officers are brought before the public, the public can calculate them accordingly
 How long will LG, BJP and LG stop @ arvindkejriwal from working? - Alka Lamba (@lambaalka) February 20, 2018 Congress leader Ajay Maken has targeted Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal over the issue
 unhone likhaa ki dilli siem ko is mudde ke liye maafee maangani chahie
 The AAP government has failed to work, but beating the officers by the mlas in front of the CM is like taking the law into their own hands
 Kejriwal should apologise for this hooliganism which took place before him-aap Govt is unable to deliver-beating of Chief Secretary by mlas in front of CM is another low & is aimed to divert attention from Govt failures!aap does not know Governance and has failed miserably😡— Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken)february 20, 2018aapako bataa den ki dilli main adhikariyon or kejariwal sarkaar ke bich is prakaar kaa vivaad koi nayaa nahin he
 Earlier too, due to this attitude of the Kejriwal government, many officials also demanded transfer from here

 Kejriwal demands apology: Congress, the Delhi Chief Secretary has attacked the Kejriwal government in Delhi over the controversy
 congress netaa ajay maakan ne kaha ki dilli ke mukhya sachiv ke saath marpet kii gai
 The lowest level of functioning of Kejriwal was seen
 aamtaur par har adhikari dilli main ruknaa chaahate hai
 But now there is such a situation in Delhi that the authorities do not want to stay in Delhi
 kai adhikari to chuttee lekar ghar baith gaye hai
 The Kejriwal government is doing this to hide its failures
 unhone kaha ki shila dikshit ke netritv main 15 saal sarkaar rahi
 In that first six years there was a BJP government at the Center, yet we made Delhi work by taking work from the same officers without excuse
 inako sarkaar chalaanaa nahin aata he
 Kejriwal should apologize
 kejariwal kii shah par ye hamalaa kiya gaya
 Their gesture must have been for this
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rafel maamle par supreme court main apana jawaab daakhil kar diya he
 Rahul Gandhi told the court that he had made such a statement during the election campaign in excitement, for which he was sorry
 rahul ne rafel maamle main pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki ab to supreme court ne bhi kah diya he ki chaukeedaar chor he
 Following this statement of Rahul, BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi filed a petition and filed a complaint of contempt of court against Rahul Gandhi
 supreme court ne congress adhyaksh ke khilaaf court kii avmaananaa karne par ye notice jari kiya tha
 Bharatiya Janata Party leader Meenakshi Lekhi filed a petition against Rahul Gandhi in the Supreme Court
 court main diya ye jav xxrep 4 a vamananaa notice se jawaab main rahul gandhi ne supreme court main kaha, haa main maanata hum ki supreme court ne kabhi nahin kaha 'chaukeedaar chaur he'
 This statement from my side was given in excitement during the election campaign
 rahul gandhi ne is maamle main anderteking dete hue kaha ki aage se main public main koi bhi aisi tippanee nahin karuunga, jab tak ki court main aisi baat record main na kahi gai ho
 He also said that my words have been misrepresented by the opponents
 beete 15 april ko supreme court main avmaananaa yachika kii sunwaayee ke dauraan chif justise ranjan gogoi ne mana ki hamane ye bayaan kabhi nahin diya he, ham is masale par safai maangenge
 The court said that we want to make it clear that whatever views have been stated in the media about the court are completely wrong
 isi maamle kii puri jaankaree ko lekar ham safai maangana chahenge
 We hope that Rahul Gandhi will clarify this statement
 rahul ke prachaar kaa hathiyaarrahul gandhi apni chunavi reliyon main pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhane ke liye 'chaukeedaar chor he’ kaa naaraa lagaataar lagavate rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi alleges that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has scammed the Rafale deal and has given Anil Ambani a benefit of around Rs 30,000 crore
 isi ko lekar rahul pradhanmantri par hamalavar hai
 The Supreme Court had earlier given a clean chit to the central government in the Rafale case and considered the purchase process of Rafale aircraft to be correct
 haalanki, iske baad prashanth bhushan, arun shouri or yashavanth sinha ne court ke faisle par punarvichaar yachika daali, jise court ne sweekaar kar liya saath hi ek akhbaar dwaara chaape gaye dastavezon ko saboot maanane kii hami bhari thi
 After this, Rahul Gandhi made this statement by breaking the court's remarks in the election meeting, while no such remarks were made directly by the court

 After Amit Shah became cabinet minister, the question is now who will become the BJP president? Jagan Prakash Nadda's name is leading in the race for the post of President
 nadda ke alaava party mahasachiv bhupendra yadav or om prakaash maathur kaa naam bhi res main he
 Nadda was not included in the Modi government
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki 'ek vyakti, ek pad' siddhant vaali bijepi ko jepi nadda ke rup main nayaa adhyaksh mil saktaa he
 JP Nadda hails from the Brahmin community of Himachal Pradesh and is strongly trusted by the BJP top leadership
 unka judaav rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se bhi rahaa he or unki chhavi saaf-suthri maani jaati he
 He was the Health Minister in the first NDA government led by Modi
 sutron ne bataaya ki nadda bijepi sansadeey board ke bhi sadsy he jo bijepi kii sheersh nirnay karne vaali sanstha he
 Nadda is also considered as the best option in this regard
 16 saal kii umr se abivipi se judejepi nadda kaa janm bihar ke patna main 2 disambar 1960 ko hua
 His early studies were from St
 Xavier's School in Patna
 iske baad nadda ne patna vishvavidhyalay se bie kii shiksha lee
 Nadda got into student politics at the age of 16 and joined the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP)
 us vakt bihar main student movement charam par tha
 In 1977, he was elected secretary in the student union elections at Patna University
 rajnath ke baad bane yuva morcha ke adhyakshajepi nadda ko 1982 main vidhyaarthee parishad kaa prachaarak banaakar himachal pradesh bheja gaya
 Nadda became the first President of the Students Council at Himachal Pradesh University in 1983-1984 and was the National General Secretary of the Students Council from the years 1986 to 1989
 1989 ke loksabhaa chunaav main nadda ko bijepi yuva morcha kaa chunaav prabharee banaaya gaya
 After Rajnath Singh, Nadda was made the National President of the Yuva Morcha in 1990
 himachal se dilli tak kaa safariske baad 1993 main jepi nadda pehali baar himachal vidhansabha pahunche
 Nadda served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly from 1994 to 1998
 saal 2008 se 2010 tak himachal sarkaar main mantri rahe
 In 2012, Nadda was sent to the Rajya Sabha from Himachal Pradesh
 nadda nitin gadakari kii team main rashtriya mahasachiv or pravaktaa rahe
 In 2014, Nadda was made a minister in the Modi government
 modi or shah se nadda ke kareebi rishtejepi nadda ke piem narendra modi or amit shah se puraane sambandh hai
 Both have been known since Modi was in charge of Himachal
 donon ashok road sthit bijepi mukhyalay main bane out house main rahete the
 After this, when Nadda was the national president of the BJP Yuva Morcha, Amit Shah was made the national treasurer of the Yuva Morcha
 upi main kaam ai nadda kii ranneetimodi sarkaar banane ke baad jepi nadda kaa kad party or sarkaar donon main kaaphi bada hua
 Nadda is considered the right-hand man of party president Amit Shah
 yahi kaaran he ki amit shah ne is baar jepi nadda ko upi fatah kii jimmedaari di
 Nadda handled this responsibility well and with his skillful strategy gave the party a resounding victory in 64 (two Apna Dal's) seats in UP
 centre sarkaar rajyasabha main ek baar phir aaj teen talaak bill ko paas karaane kii koshish kar sakati he
 However, there is little hope of success in this
 rajyasabha main sarkaar ke paas sankhya he nahin or vipaksh apane is rukh par kaayam he ki jo bill sarkaar paas karana chaahati he usamen tamaam khamiyaan hai or usko salect cameti ke paas bheji jane kii sakht jarurat he
 Jaitley's attack on the opposition After failing to get the bill passed in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the Congress party was indirectly opposing the triple divorce bill
 wo chaahate to is par koi suzav de sakate the, lekin wo sirf isko taalane kii koshish main lage hai
 He said that today was a golden opportunity for Parliament to correct the injustice being done to Muslim women for years
 lekin congress party ne use nahin hone diya
 The desire of the people of the country will be fulfilled
 sarkaar phir karegi koshishjetali kii baton se yah baat saaf tha kisarkaargruuvaar ko phir se is bill ko paas karaane kii koshish kar sakati he
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also said that today people have seen who are obstructing Muslim women in the way of getting justice
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki sarkaar apni taraf se is bill ko jald se jald paas karaane ke liye puri takat lagaaegi
 The government has two days time
 The government has only 2 days to pass this bill
 sheetakaaleen satr 5 janvari ko khatm ho rahaa he
 Before that, the government also has to pass the necessary GST amendment bill, which has been passed in the Lok Sabha
 TDP or AIADMK bhi vipaksh ke saath!khaas baat yah he ki sarkaar ranneeti ke tahat sabase zyada nishaanaa congress ke khilaaf hi saadh rahi he or usee ko is bill ko nahin paas hone kaa doshi tehra rahi he
 The truth is that not only all the opposition parties but also parties like TDP and AIADMK, who usually support the government, are insisting on sending the Select Committee on triple talaq
 rajyasabha main buudhvaar ko jo hua use dekhte hue yah baat saaf thi ki trinmul congress bhi majbootee se vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi he or is bill ko select cameti main bheje jane ko lekar aakraamak rukh dikhaa rahi he
 On these issues, all the leaders of the opposition in the government and the opposition made it clear after the end of the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha that if the government tries to pass this bill, then there will be no change in their attitude
 zyaadaatar partiyon kaa kahana yah he ki vah teen talaak kii haalat main pati ko 3 saal ke liye jail bheje jane ke khilaaf hai
 The government says that if the fear of being sent to jail is over, then this law will have no meaning
 uttarakhand ke purv mukhyamantri harish ravat mandir-mandir gum rahe hai
 After losing in the court of the public, Harish Rawat is going to God and pleading in the hope of justice
 kareeb ek saal pehle tatkaaleen mukhyamantri harish ravat ko ek nahin balki do-do siton par karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 But, the very next day Harish Rawat came out and met the people as if they did not realize his crushing defeat
 10 maheene ke antaraal ke baad aisa lag rahaa he ki jaise unka chupa hua dard baahar aa gaya ho
 This time, he has reached the stage of Janardan, not among the public, to find his pain
 'ummid ke mutabik nahin mila insaaf'harish ravat ke mutabik jis insaaf kii ummid unhen janata se thi wo insaaf unhen nahin mila, isiilie wo apni kamiyon ko talashne ke liye bhagwaan ke dar par maathaa tech rahe hai
 They hope to get justice
 harish ravat agar vaaki janata ke liye kuch kar pate to nishchit rup se unhen yun hi haar kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 If Harish Rawat, who had taken a pledge to end corruption from the very first day, would have controlled it from the very first day, he would have probably won his victory flag in Devbhoomi
 'jab tak jitunga nahin, jawan hi rahoonga'ek sawaal ke jawaab memharish ravatane kaha ki janardan se unhen sanket bhi mil rahe hai or haar ke kya kaaran rahe ye bhi samajhane kaa mauka mil rahaa he
 But in the gestures, he made it clear that he is not one of those who give up like this, taking a dig at the BJP
 unka kahana he ki jab tak wo haar kaa badla nahin le lete wo jawan hi rahenge
 With this, he has given a direct message to the BJP on the one hand, while on the other hand he has also indicated to the leaders opposing him within his own party that they still have power left

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath is baar mathura jile ke barsaanaa main latoomaar holi khelenge

 barsaanaa kii yah latoomaar holi duniya bhar main mashhoor he
 Earlier, on February 23, at 05:30 pm, CM Yogi would go to the Veterinary College in Mathura and take part in the Brij Holi program there
 siem yogike mathura pahunchane ko lekar sthaneey logon main khaasaa utsaah he, lekin duusari ore isko lekar raajnneeti shuru ho gai
 The opposition says that cms are only attending the festival of Hindus and ignoring the festivals of the rest of the sect
 virdohi ise bhi pradesh ke mukhiya ke kathith hindutv agenda kaa hissaa maan rahe hai
 Recently, the tourism department of UP decided to start the Taj Mahotsava with the staging of Ramayana
 isko bhi muslim samudaay main achche nazariye se nahin dekha gaya
 CM Yogi is being criticized for the alleged double standards of Hindus joining the festival and distance from Muslim festivals
 barasaane kii mashhoor holi main mahilaayein haath main latth lekar purushon ko peethti hai or purush is par apana bachaav karte hai
 Some people of Muslim society feel that CM Yogi should stay away from such events, because it gives a message of inclination towards a particular religion
 ajtak-india today se baatcheet main agra ke samaajawaadee party ke netaa raisuddin pehle hi kah chuke hai ki siem kaa hindu tyoharon ke prati lagaav dikhaane se vaishvik str par upi ke bare main galat sandesh ja rahaa he
 Such an image is being formed that this state is running a communal government
 isse rajya kaa vikaas prabhavit hoga or akhilesh yadav ke samay jo tarakkee kaa pahiyaa chal padaa tha, us par roak lag jaaegi
 Earlier, Chief Minister Yogin celebrated Diwali in Ayodhya and now he is going to celebrate Holi at Barsane in Mathura
 vahiin, mathura ke sthaneey adhikari siem ke daure ko lekar taiyaariyaan kar rahe hai
 According to sources, this program along with CM Yogi will also include artists like Pandit Jasraj, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Hema Malini, Dharmendra
 siem is maukey par barsaanaa main ek byogas plant kaa bhi udghaatan karenge

 Hence the murder of Shivani was hatched

 hycourt ke saamne mukhyamantri kaa paksh rakhte hue atirikt mahadhivaktaa bulbul godiyal ne praarambhik aapatti prastut kii,jisamen kaha gaya ki yah piiel nahin he
 On this, the court said that the things the government has to say should be submitted in writing
 yachika ke anusaar upi main mukhyamantri patrawali par swayan hastakshar nahin karte or unki jagah mukhyamantri karyaalay ke adhikari unke naam par patrawali anumodith karte hai
 This is contrary to the principles of the law because it eradicates the sense of responsibility and is prone to many kinds of controversy and misuse

 After the passing of this act, on 1 September 1956, an insurance company, called Life Insurance Corporation of India, was created
 1956 se desh kii arthvyavastha ke saath-saath beemaa ke kshetra main bhi kai chijen badali hai
 Many new players have joined this field, but LIC remains at the forefront in this environment of competition
 ise bhi padhein: sankat main LIC, modi sarkaar ke is kadam se kahin dub na jaae aapke beemaa kii rakambima kaarobaar main 69% bhagidaari:beemaa kaarobaar main kai badi nijee companiyaan bhi utari hui hai, lekin uskaa asar elisi par dur-dur tak hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 LIC still accounts for 69 per cent of the entire insurance business
 vitt varsh 2017-18 main elisi ne naye kaarobaar main 8 fisadi kii growth hasil kii he
 According to the information given on lic's website, the company has 2048 branches across the country
 113 diviginal offis hai, 8 jonal karyaalay hai
 There are 1381 satellite offices and corporate offices
 deshbhar main faile apane is network ke jariye elisi har tarah kaa beemaa desh ke aam naagarik ko muhaiyaa karaati he
 The common man's first choice is LIC: Whenever a common man thinks of saving money or buying insurance, the name of LIC comes first in his mind
 darasal logon ko bharosa he ki elisi main lagaaya unka paisa kabhi dubegaa nahin
 Therefore, the common man of the country prefers to turn to LIC instead of going to other insurance companies
 beemaa hi nahin, naukari bhi detii he lic:elisi aam aadmi ke liye ek bharosemand beemaa company hi nahin he, balki yah unke rojgaar kaa bhi ek avasar he
 People's trust is increased even more because it does not lag behind in recruiting agents
 2008 main ai mandi ke daur kii hi baat karen, to is samay jahaan zyaadaatar companiyaan apane karmchaariyon ko naukari se nikaal rahi thim
 At the same time, LIC was constantly recruiting agents
 2008 se 2010 ke bich jahaan nijee companiyon ke paas 9
 There were 5 lakh agents
 elisi ke paas is dauraan 11
 There were 31 lakh agents
 lekin ab kyon he chintaa:bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam ke idibiai bank ko kharidne kii charchaa chal rahi he
 This deal is being raised because the bank's NPA or non-performing assets are the highest among public sector banks
 aise main ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki kahin iskaa asar elisi ke kaarobaar par na pade
 Because if this happens, it can have a small impact on the policy holders of LIC as well
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki karj main duube bank ko elisi kii taraf se kharida janaa idibiai bank ke liye kitna phydemand sabit hota he or nigam ke policydharakon par iskaa kitna or kaisaa asar dekhne ko miltaa he
