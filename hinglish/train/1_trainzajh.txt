 Even with the third new ball, he worked hard and kept trying to take wickets
 unhone apni ore se puraa prayaas kiya lekin aakhirkaar hamen is nattejey ko sweekaar karnaa hoga
 Asked about the assessment of the team's performance on the bowlers, the bowlers did a 'great' performance, saying that he was disappointed with the performance of the players in the ODI series
 unhone kaha, 'ham vanade main apane pradarshan se niraash the kyonki ham jeetne kii sthiti main pahunchakar nahin jite
 We knew that the Test series would be tough because there are not many players in the team who have played more than five, six or seven Tests
 kul milakar hamane acha pradarshan kiya, khaskar gendbaaji main
 Many people did not think that we would be able to take 20 wickets as the spinners were not getting wickets, but in the first Test we did it and here in the first innings
 hamane apane pradarshan main sudhaar kiya
 "dhoni desperate to come to New Zealand again!" Dhoni said, "we are eager to return here to play the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next year

 While presenting his first railway budget on Thursday, Suresh Prabhu mentioned the bullet train
 mumbai-ahmedabad trek par hispid train chalaane ke maamle main
 Whose study report will come in the middle of this year
 baaki ke bajet main bullate train ko lekar utana jor nahin rahaa, jitna ki upie ke rail bajaton main dikhaai detaa rahaa he
 The reason for this is -1
 ghate vaali bhartiya rail main cash kii samasya hameshaa bani rahati he
 In such a situation, it is difficult to complete the bullet train project on time
 2
 According to the cost, there is an estimate that eight hundred Rajdhani trains can be run at the expense of one bullet train
 9 coach vaali ek bullate train par laagat 60 hajaar karod aati he, jabaki 17 coach vaali rajdhani 75 karod main chal padati he
 3
 kam gati kii trainon main hi suraksha kaa bada abhaav he
 Especially in case of accidents
 bullate ke maamle main to or zyada ehtiyaat kii jarurat he
 For which there is no flower-proof technology in India yet
 4
 If the bullet train is run on the existing track, then the scope of its running will always be less
 kyonki use root par chalane vaali anya gadiyon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana hoga
 Who are often late 5
 In the rest of the world, where the bullet train runs, separate tracks have been made for it
 lekin bharat main is trek ko banane kaa matlab he har kimi par 115 karod rupye kaa kharch
 6
 ab bhi yah sawaal to he hi ki lambii duuri ke liye jab tej safar logon ko hawaii jahaaj se hasil he to koi use train se kyon karegaa
 Many times airplane fares are cheaper than trains
 7
 When there are many malfunctions in the normal operation of normal trains, then what is the guarantee that the highly expensive bullet train project will not have to be stopped in the middle
 8
 Bullet trains have been operating in China for a long time
 lekin kai root behad ghate main hai
 Which is being discontinued
 bharat main aisa nahin hoga, isaki koi guarantee nahin he
 9
 bullate train kii maang janata kii taraf se kabhi nahin ai
 It has been made part of the budget to increase the pride of the country
 dilli metro kii safalataa uski pablak demand ke kaaran he
 This is not yet the case with bullet trains
 10
 For a long time, the challenge has been to repair only the basic railway facilities, which are very backward and in a poor condition
 bullate train ke maamle main bharat or china:ye tulana isliye he ki ye donon hi desh lagbhag saath-saath swatantra hue
 But by running a bullet train at a speed of three and a half to four hundred kilometers per hour, China has established its rule over this technology
 bhale hi usapar chori kii takanic se bullate train network taiyaar karne kaa aarope ho
 - On April 18, 2007, China ran the first high speed train, the bullet train, but since then it broke all records
 - aaj china ke paas 11 hajaar kilometre se zyada kaa bullate train network he
 There are about 2660 bullet trains running and they connect 100 cities
 isamen rojaanaa 20 lakh log safar karte hai
 By the end of 2015, China will expand the bullet track by 18 thousand kilometers
 - china ne tibet main duniya kaa sabase ooncha bullate rail network taiyaar kiya he
 He has laid tracks in the hills of Tibet at a height of 12 thousand feet
 - yahi nahin china ne duniya kii sabase lanbaa bullate train trek bichaane kaa kaam bhi kiya he
 The track from Beijing to Shenzhen is 2400 kilometers long
 philhal 2400 kilometre kaa ye trek honkong kii seemaa ko choota he
 The plan is that China will take it to Hong Kong by 2015
 - china bullate train par betahasha paisa kharch kar rahaa he
 According to a rough estimate, he has already invested 500 billion dollars or 30 lakh crore rupees in building the network
 network ko aage badhaane ke liye wo 133 billian dollar lagane ko taiyaar he
 It has increased the number of network building projects from 20 to 64

 But cannot implement it until the case is settled

 The Income Tax Department in the Supreme Court said that their tax has been rescheduled and an order has been passed against them
 lekin supreme court ke aadesh ke mutabik vah aadesh lagu nahin nahi kiya gaya he
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court ordered the Income Tax Department to continue the fresh assessment of income tax of party president Rahul Gandhi, UPA chairman Sonia Gandhi and senior leader Oscar Fernandes
 haalanki court ne kaha ki is moolyankan ko court ke antim aadesh ke baad hi amal main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Let us tell you that UPA President Sonia Gandhi, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Oscar Fernandes have challenged the order of Delhi High Court in which it was directed to reopen their income tax assessment of 2011-12 related to National Herald case

 ---input bhashaa se If we talk till a few days ago, coalition partners in Bihar and Jharkhand were hard pressed to find each other
 har koi isi koshish main tha ki vah duusare ke janaadhar main send lagaakar apane chunavi vot bank ko or adhik vistrut kar le
 But now after the formal declaration of general elections, it is clear by looking at the political atmosphere of both the states how quickly and how big a change has come in the conscience of these leaders
 or aise main tajjub nahin ki kendriya ispaat mantri ram vilaas paswan joki pichley kuch arase se rail mantri lalu prasad yadav ke saath chhattis kaa aankada banaae baithe the, ab ''rajd ke saath loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye vyaavhaarik gathjod'' banane ke liye taiyaar najar aa rahe hai
 Similarly, the Janata Dal (U) is pressurizing its trusted ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to give more seats, while the Maharashtrians of the saffron party in Jharkhand are wooing the rebels of the party and Jharkhand Vikas Party chief Babu Lal is engaged in pre-poll alliances with Marandi
 lekin isamen safalataa kii koi ummid najar nahin aa rahi
 Apparently, Lalu Yadav and Paswan, who aspire to hold the office of Prime Minister, are fully hopeful that like every other time this coming together will bring magic
 iske alaava, nitish kumaar ke bihar se mila sandesh bhi ek aisa kaaran najar aata he jisane in do kshatrapon ko haath milaane ke liye majaboor kiya he
 Of course, many decisions of the Nitish government have given sleep to these satraps
 atyadhik pichhadaa varg (ibisi) ke liye panchayat main 20 fisadi aarakshan or bihar main mahadaliton tathaa muslimon ke kalyaan ke liye nitish ke uthaae vishesh kadamon ne lalu or paswan ke liye daliton, yadavon, muslimon or anya pichhadaa varg sambandhi apane jatigat gathbandhan par ateet jaisi pakad banaae rakhane ko thodaa mushkil jarur kiya he
 Lalu, who once ruled the state for fifteen years due to the overwhelming support of the Yadavs, Dalits and minorities in Bihar, was ousted from power in the 2005 assembly elections when Paswan deserted him and his rival Nitish
 Gained power in the rainbow coalition
 haalanki rashtriya janata dal (rajd) or lok janashakti party (lojpa) main siton ko lekar aupchaarik samjhauta hona abhi baaki he
 Not only this, there is also a possibility that RJD and LJP should not reach any solution on some seats which have become the root of the dispute
 in virodhabhaason ke baavjood is baat main koi shubahaa nahin he ki lalu or paswan gathbandhan ko amalijama pehanaane ke liye puri tarah se patibaddh najar aa rahe hai
 Till now, both these leaders have been successful in taking advantage of caste polarization for electoral gains
 agar loksabhaa chunaav 2009 ke sandarbh main dekhen to paristhitiyaan thodi alag najar aati hai kyonki muslim, mahadalit or atyadhik pichhadaa varg nitish kumaar ke rup main ek majboot vikalp khoj saktaa he
 For example, so far Muslims have probably supported Lalu and Paswan, but if they do a deep study, this time they can go with Nitish Kumar for a "better deal"
 sandesh ekadam saaf he, raajnneetik pravaah main koi bhi ek party yaa gathbandhan hameshaa ek jati yaa samudaay ke pratinidhitiv kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa kyonki ve aapako yah mauka nahin denge ki aap unhen hameshaa halke main hi len
 And that's why Lalu and Paswan have become pragmatic about their stand in the run-up to the 2009 general elections
 isi tarah, padosi rajya jharkhand main jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main upie ke saath bane rahane kaa faisla liya he
 His decision has taken everyone by surprise as the Congress and the RJD had rejected all candidates of the JMM chief minister after Shibu Soren stepped down as chief minister, leading to a rift in the UPA in the state
 jhamumo ne pakhwaade bhar pehle apana rukh or kadaa kar liya tha or kaha tha ki vah bihar ke adivasee bahul pocket main rajd ke khilaaf ummidavaar utaaregaa
 Meanwhile, there were also indications of JMM joining the BJP
 is par upie netritv ne harakat main aate hue tushtikaran kii niti par kaam shuru kar diya
 Under this, the Jharkhand Assembly was not dissolved, leaving Soren's hope of occupying the top post of Jharkhand alive
 shaayad yahi vah kaaran he jisane jhamumo pramukh ko hisaab baraabar karne ke liye majaboor kiya
 Further, Lalu worked on 9 March to heal wounds when he visited AIIMS in New Delhi to meet Soren
 aakhirkaar saare gile-shikave dur ho gaye or jhamumo ne upie ke saath bane rahane kii ghoshnaa kar daali
 But it is also worth noting that shortly before, Soren promised that he will continue to teach Lalu political lessons
 lekin gathbandhan ke in teenon sahyogiyon ko pataa he ki is baar rajya main unhen pichhali baar kii apeksha adhik mushkil chotii par vijay hasil kerani he
 In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the alliance won 12 out of 14 seats in the state
 bhaajapa ko sirf ek hi seat se santosh karnaa padaa tha joki baad main saansad babu laal marandi ke jharkhand vikaas party kaa gathan karne se haath se nikal gai thi
 This time also, the allocation of seats will be on the lines of 2004, four seats for JMM, six seats for Congress and two seats for RJD
 jharkhand main upie sahyogiyon ko sipii or marandi dwaara jiti gai siton par samjhauta karnaa baaki he
 Incidentally, the jmm's coming to the Congress fold after the BJD moved away from the BJP helped send a message to the Congress that the UPA is a better option
 haalanki vaastaviktaa main yah daawa abhi siddh hona baaki he
 But one of the reasons for the bjp's enthusiasm in Jharkhand is the poor administration of the UPA in the state
 2005 ke jharkhand vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad se nirdaleey vidhayakon ne satta ko manamafik haanka he
 However, it can be said that with the unification of the UPA alliance, everything will not be easy for the BJP
 rajnatik paryvekshakon ke mutabik, aam aadmi ke vaadon par bhaajapa ke khara na utar paane kaa 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav parinaamon par gaharaa asar padaa tha
 But now the circumstances have changed a lot
 haalanki sorain ke bete durga sorain ek baadha ke rup main ubhare hai
 Durga has asked Congress and RJD leaders to support the JMM candidate for the post of Chief Minister of Jharkhand before entering into an electoral alliance with Guruji
 vahiin, durga se mulaakaat karne vaale congress saansad phurkan ansaari ne bharosa jataayaa he ki jhamumo ke saath gathbandhan barkaraar rahegaa

 The It is the same state that gave a clear majority to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014, and ensured bjp's dominance in the post-election National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government
 party ne rajya kii 80 siton main se 71 par (sahyogi dalon ke saath 73) jeet hasil kii thi, or phir 2014 vaala vipaksh ko patkhni dene kaa karishma varsh 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi doharaaya
 If the BJP maintains its hold here, it will come back to power in a spectacular manner, the NDA may get support from outside even if the results are very low, and a coalition government can be formed, but if here If there is a big drop in bjp's vote, then the BJP will be in the dark
 uttar pradesh main pratidwandvi dost ban gaye hai, taaki 'saajha dushman' BJP se mukaabil ho saken
 Apart from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), several parties are coming together to form a grand alliance, hoping that their combined strength will defeat the opponent badly
 varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ve 60 siton par duusare yaa tisare sthaan par rahe the
 If their votes are added, they can reverse the victory in half of bjp's seats (36) at present
 aadha darj siten aisi bhi hai, jinamein BJP ke khilaaf sirf 2
 a 5 percent change would also translate victory into defeat
 duusare shabdon main kahen, to is tarah hone vaali haar samooche bihar yaa pashchim bengal ke baraabar hogi
 Such figures come out as assuming that votes are transferred from one party to another
 BSP aamtaur par dalit voton ko khinchne main kaamyaab rahi he, lekin SP apni takaton kaa aisa istemaal karne ke liye nahin jaani jaati
 They also believe that the voters' interest in the election increases by splitting the seats and putting up common candidates
 iske alaava, is baat kii aalochana bhi ho rahi he ki mahagathbandhan main congress ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya, jisane varsh 2014 main aath fisadi vot hasil kiye the, or jinke saath aa jane se 14 anya siton par bhi mahagathbandhan kii jeet lagbhag tay ho jaati
 Let us begin our journey from the western Uttar Pradesh dominated by Jats, especially from Mathura, Hathras and Agra
 varsh 2014 main BJP ne yahaan behad shandaar pradarshan kiya tha, or 50 pratishat se bhi zyaada vot hasil kiye the
 But these are the seats whose history shows that they do not stay with any party for long, and any major changes coming here can create problems for BJP
 (uttar pradesh main chote kisaan baari byaaj daron par milane vaale karz main duube hue hai
 
 
 ) As we move towards the areas where the BJP performed well in 2014, it is largely the area where former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh has had a significant influence
 so, ab dekhne vaali baat yah he ki kya charan singh ke putr ajit singh kii party RLD apane mahagathbandhan kii is ilaake main koi madad kar paaegi
 
 
 ? We first stopped at an absolutely middle-class restaurant on the Agra Expressway
 'jolly go foodcourt' naamak is sthaan par sab kuch sirf 'modi ji' ke paksh main dikhaa
 The Indians who settled here were seen standing firmly with the Prime Minister, whether they were youth, elderly, other local people, or tourists visiting from Pune
 unke paas BJP, or vishesh rup se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke bare main bolne ke liye sirf 'acha-acha' he
 The manager of this restaurant however turned out to be very alert and aware
 vah khud bhale hi majbooti se BJP kaa samarthan karata he, lekin ushka maananaa he ki jevar main, jahaan dilli ke liye ek airport banane vaala he, logon kaa BJP ke prati samarthan vaisaa nahin he, jaisaa pichhali baar tha
 According to him, people are never satisfied
 (varsh 2012 main ajit singh kii RLD ne pashchimi uttar pradesh kii sabhi nau siten jiti thim
 
 
 ) People are still looking forward to the start of airport work in Jewar town, as no land has been taken or sought so far, but they all believe that the creation of the airport will transform the area
 pichhali baar 50 fisadi se kuch zyaada vot paakar jiti gautam buddha nagar seat par BJP ko is baar bhi koi dikkat nahin honi chahie, kyonki noida main party kaa paramparaagat middle-class vot bank badi taadaad main rahata he
 We now grow on the fertile agricultural belt of Mathura, where potato and mustard crops are being harvested, while wheat still has one month left
 sabhi paimaanon se fasal shandaar hui he, haalanki keemten kuch kam lag rahi hai
 Most farmers admitted that they could no longer wait for the government to buy mustard, and that is why they were selling it to local traders
 (vrundavan ke nikat aalu kii shandaar fasal katate kisaan
 
 
 ) Jat farmer Yogendra Singh in Jaralia said that he needs a price of Rs 2,500 per quintal today, not after six weeks
 so, agar use sarkari samarthan mulya kii vajah se nuksaan ho rahaa he, to bahut buree baat he, kyonki use bhi karza chukaana he
 But despite this, there is no decrease in the support that he has for the BJP
 uskaa kahana he, kisaanon ke liye bhale hi na ho, desh ke liye BJP hi sarvshereshth he
 Discussion of who benefits them, and what is better for the country, and understanding the difference in it, seems common in this area
 aisa lagata he, log rajya kii BJP sarkaar ke bhrashtachar or kuprabandhan ko nazarandaaz kar narendra modi ko samarthan dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 Devi Singh, a Jatav vegetable vendor in Bajna in Hathras parliamentary constituency, mocked the plan to build toilets in every house, saying, "they dig a little bit, put two bricks, and they're done
" 
 
 " iske baad paise jeb main daal lete hai
 But despite this, he believes that PM Narendra Modi is the right person for the country
 yahi vichaar he peeche maujuud dhabas main rasoiye ke rup main kaam karne vaale chandrapal kaa
 Chandrapal, who hails from the Jat community, says the RLD may perform better this time, but "modi ji will still win, and in 2024 too
" 
 
 "(chote va majhole kisaanon kii madad ke liye yogi adityanath sarkaar ne varsh 2017 main 32,000 karod rupee kii karzmaafee yojana kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 
 
 ) Similarly, there is a lot of anger among the people about the wheat crop being eaten or crushed by hooves, and many believe that the government should work more in this direction, but the rest of the people in this matter Yogendra Singh Look more enthusiastic like, who says, "cow is part of our culture, and we have to deal with these problems ourselves
 
 
 "yogendra ko zyaada chintaa apane khet main bijli kii zyaada keemat (1,850 rupee pratimah) tathaa sarson kii fasal se kam kamai ko lekar he
 Nothing has been done for the farmers, this sentiment is also widely present
 kuch log apni baat kehane se hichakate rahe, vrundavan ke baahar ke jat kisaan raghubir singh ne apana gussa katai nahin chipaaya
 He raised criticisms on all issues, from entering livestock fields to loan waiver
 raghubir singh ne to aalochana karte vakt sashastr balon ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 (although stray cows have always been a part of rural life, farmers say that their numbers have increased in recent years
 
 
 )uskaa sawaal tha, jo log desh ke liye jaan qurbaan karte hai, agar unhen 40 lakh rupee or petrol pump diya ja saktaa he, to kya puure desh ko roti khilaane kii koshish main mar jane vaale kisaanon ko kuch nahin milanaa chahie
 
 
 According to him, the expenditure incurred on Kumbh in Prayagraj by the state BJP government was excessive
 uskaa kahana tha, "karz or fasal ugane kii laagat kisaanon kii jaan le rahi he, isiilie khudakushi ho rahi hai
 
 
 "raghubir Singh did not just say this, but also showed it in a dramatic way by making a noose near his neck
 ek or kisaan ne khet main katkar rakhi gai fasal ke dher kii taraf ishaara kar kaha ki vah raat ko vahiin sota he, taaki fasal par hamalaa kar kha jane vaale jaanwaron se use bachaa sake
 He asks, why do farmers have to sleep so restlessly, while the rest of the country sleeps comfortably on the mattresses in their bedrooms
 
 
 ?or lo
 
 
 Despite such complaints, many people also met, who are not ready to blame the Narendra Modi government for this
 govindpur main ek chaay kii tapari (tii stall) par kisaanon ne kaha, "haa, pashuon ne kuch fasal barbaad kar di, or yah dikkat he, lekin fasal acchhee hui he, pichley saal se behatar, so, chintaa kisalie
 
 
 ? "he also said," The potato crop is fantastic, so, of course, the price will be around six rupees per kg
 
 
 bas, jamaa kar rakhen, or intazaar karen
 
 
 "meanwhile, an elderly man comes out loud and says," It is only Modi
 
 
 "yah dekhnaa dilachasp rahaa ki har bazaar yaa bade samooh main shuru kii gai charchaa main koi na koi aisa hameshaa mila, jiskaa BJP se gaharaa taalluk tha, or vah baatcheet ko kisi khaas disha main le jane kii koshish karata tha
 In this way, the 'hijacking' of the discussion done in a 'cover-up' manner resulted in many people getting discouraged to say their point
 isi vajah se, bhale hi sabhi ne kisaanon main maujuud gusse or berojgaare kii baat kabool kii, lekin naukariyon kaa sankat yaa abhaav aisa bada mudda rahaa, jis par charchaa ho hi nahin pai
 An Agra newspaper has also confirmed the fact that bjp's hold in the area remains strong
 akhbaar ke mutabik, agra se sate fatehpur sikri (mughal badshaah akbar kii rajdhani) kii sansadeey seat se BSP kii pichhali baar kii pratyaashee (or purv saansad) seemaa upaadhyaay chunaav ladane se inkaar kar rahi hai, kyonki shaayad unhen lag rahaa he ki vah BJP ko pichhali baar mili 2
 Will not be able to reverse the lead of 5 lakh votes
 pulavama kii vaardaat ne bhi is ilaake main modi factor ko kahin zyaada majboot kar diya he
 
 
 After all, this is the area from where the number of army personnel is very large
 
 
 dilli se sate gudgaanv main ek mahila pulicekarmi ke saath chhedhkhani kii sharmnaak vaardaat saamne ai he
 The woman policeman was returning home by bike
 raste main teen yuvakon ne uskaa rasta rokkar chhedhkhani shuru kar di
 Two accused escaped after locals gathered on the spot
 lekin ek aaropee ko pakadakar logon ne police ko saunp diya
 According to the information, the incident is from Bilaspur Chowk near delhi-jaipur highway
 bhudaka gaanv nivasee mahila consteble faridabad main tainaat he
 The victim was going to her village on a bike from Bilaspur Chowk after getting off the bus at around 8 pm on Saturday night
 kuch dur aage hi teen yuvak sharaab pi rahe the
 Seeing the woman, they stopped her bike
 mahila pulicekarmi unhen andekha karke aage badhane lagi
 The accused followed him and started molesting him
 is tarah khuleam chhedhkhani par peedita or aropiyon ke bich kahasuni ho gai
 Hearing the noise of the quarrel, the people of the victim's house and nearby people came there
 apane aap ko fansata dekh aaropee vahaan se bhaagane kii koshish karne lage
 Meanwhile, one of the accused climbed into the hands of the people, who was lynched on the spot
 peedita ke bayaan par ghayal aaropee ke khilaaf cese darj kar use giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 The accused is hospitalized, where further action will be taken as soon as he is discharged
 2 aaropee abhi faraar hai
 Police are giving help in their search
 kaha jaataa he ki saarvajanik jivan main apane vipakshi par waar ek maryaada main hi kiya jaataa he
 But it seems that this rule is not followed in Indian politics
 pichley kuch dinon se bhartiya rajaneta ek duusare par waar-prativaar main shaayad sabakuch bhul gaye hai
 These days the center of Indian politics remains a 'dog'
 uttar pradesh chunaav ke dauraan 'gadhaa' prachlit hua tha or gujarat chunaav se pehle jang 'kute' par ho rahi he
 It is being discussed only after the video of Rahul Gandhi's pet 'dog' PD came out
 bijepi kii ore se bhi rahul ko poster jari kar rahul ko 'peediman' bana diya
 This is not the first time that the word 'dog' has been used in politics
 abhi haal hi main kuch samay pehle loksabhaa main charchaa ke dauraan ye shabd charchaa main aayaa tha
 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, while attacking the central government, said, "gandhi ji sacrificed for the unity of the country, Indira ji sacrificed, who went from your house?" Not even a dog went
 ''khadge ke is tanj kaa javabpradhanmantri narendra modine apane hi andaaj main diya tha
 Modi had said, "champaran is the year of Satyagraha centenary"
 itihaas kitabon main rahe to samaaj ko prerana nahin detaa
 It is necessary to try to know and live history in every era
 us samay ham the yaa nahin the? hamaare kute bhi the yaa nahin the?
 
 
 Others may have dogs
 
 
 ham kutton vaali parampara main paley-bade nahin hai
 Kharge's remarks were opposed by the people of the ruling party
 khud spikar sumitra mahajan ne bhi is tarah kii tippanee se bachane ko kaha tha lekin piem modi ne iskaa jawaab apane hi andaaj main diya tha
 Significantly, the political atmosphere has been hot since this Rahul Gandhi PD tweet
 donon dal is mudde par ek duusare ko gherne main lage hue hai, jaahir he aane vaale samay main gujarat or himachal pradesh vidhansabha chunaav ke prachaar main bhi is mudde ko suna ja saktaa he

 The first clinic is planned to open more than 200 clinics ready in Bhopal
 Although the opponents of Delhi's Kejriwal government do not get tired of attacking the Mohalla clinic, but the Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh is stuck on this concept
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ke haalia faisle ko dekhen to usase yahi sandesh ja rahaa he ki kejariwal kaa mohalla clinics concept swasthya ke kshetra main hit he
 Soon on the lines of Delhi, you will also see Mohalla clinic in the state where people from poor sections will be able to get free treatment and many types of tests

 The team of 'aaj Tak' also reached the first Mohalla Clinic in Madhya Pradesh which is almost ready in the capital Bhopal

 Many babas like Asaram and Ram Rahim are lodged in jail due to their black acts and are waiting for their turn for the verdict
 aisa hi ek nae baba kaa khulaasa dilli main police ne kiya he
 The name is Ashu Bhai Guruji
 iljaam in par bhi rape kaa hi he
 Baba is absconding since the case was filed
 uske ashram khaali pade hai
 Nobody knows where Guruji disappeared
 lekin police aarobi baba or uske bete ko shiddat se talash kar rahi he
 But the question is, why is Delhi Police kind to a Baba? Dati Maharaj Here we are talking about Dati Maharaj, the founder of Shani Dham Temple
 baat isi saal 11 june kii he
 a woman had caused sensation by accusing her of rape on Datati Maharaj, the founder of the famous Shani Dham temple in Fatehpur Beri area of delhi
 mahila ne daati maharaj ke khilaaf police main shikaayat darj karai thi
 On the complaint of the victim, a case was registered against Dati Maharaj under sections 354, 376 and 377 of IPC
 peedita ne apni shikaayat main kaha tha ki do saal pehle daati maharaj ne uske saath mandir ke andar hi rape kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya tha
 But surprisingly, Dati Maharaj has not yet been arrested in this case
 court ne ab is maamle main police se stats report maangi he
 The accounts of many babas playing with the adoration of the innocent after decorating the shop of Bhagwanpakhand of Kalyug
 lekin ab bhi hamaare ird-gird aise baabaaon kii koi kami nahin, jin par balaatkaar se lekar qatl or logon ko napunsak banane se le kar deshadroh karne jaise sangeen ilzaam hai or kaanoon unka bhi hisaab karne kii taiyaari main he
 In one of these samples, some are in the clutches of the police, some are rubbing heels in jail and some are running away from the police after covering Babagiri shop
 aaraaram bapuasaram kaa paap or us paap kaa hashr to ab ham sabake saamne he
 Asaram's last breath is now imprisoned
 magar baabalok main maujuud asaram naa to aakhri baba hai or naa hi aakhri mujrim
 Behind them is a long army of Babas whose breath is yet to be captured
 baba narayan saiis kadi main pehla number to baap ke baad bete kaa hi he
 His son Narayan Sai followed in the footsteps of Asaram
 baap ke peeche-peeche ye bhi jail pahunche
 Now the date of calculation of their crimes is also near
 baap kii tarah hi bete par bhi balaatkaar kaa ilzaam he
 Who will forget Gurmati Ram Rahim Singh Insais Baba zaraa si kaanoon ne nazaren tedi kya kii, ek saath kai rajyon main aag lagava di
 When he became an action hero with Baba, he really came down to action
 baabaaon kii maujuuda jamaat se ye bhi koi alag baba nahin nikle
 There is the same accusation on this too
 yani rape kaa
 The lower court has already sent Hiram Rahim Singh Insa to jail for 20 years
 par abhi qatl or apane hi bhakton ko napunsak banane ke maamle main hisaab kitaab hona baaki he
 Baba's Baby Now when it comes to Hero Baba, how can we leave Heroine? Yes, this is Baba's honey
 jinhone akele puure desh kii police ko hafton chakaaya
 Spent months tab jaakar badi mushkil se haath ai
 It is alleged that in order to prevent Baba Ram Rahim from going to jail, he burnt the spark in several states simultaneously and killed more than 30 people
 apane hero kii tarah hi ye bhi abhi jail main hi he
 It is yet to be calculated
 baba virendra dev dikshitumr ke is padaav par ye mahashay bhi asaram, narayan sai or ram rahim jaise ilzaamon se hi ghire hai
 The name is Baba Virendra Dev Dixit
 baba ne aadhyatmik ishwariya vishvavidhyalay ke naam par desh main naa maaloom kitne ashram khol rakhe hai, lekin kehete hai ki jo bhi ladki ek baar inke ashram main jaati he, wo bhi aasaani se baahar nahin nikal paati
 They are also accused of rape
 par ye baba thode chatur hai
 Here, accusations were made and escaped there
 ab sibiai peeche padi he
 If not today, tomorrow also they will be behind bars
 falahari maharajanam par mat jaaiega
 There may be misunderstanding
 bas itnaa samaj lijie ki karam vaise hi hai, jo asaram se lekar ram rahim tak ke rahe
 His Baba is also currently in jail for rape charges
 faisla kabhi bhi ho saktaa he
 What can i say about these Baba's? They have done the limit
 muraad or aulad do aise astron kaa istemaal kiya ki na jane kitnon kii aabru chali gai
 They themselves are the robbers of the peach
 lihaaza, inaki jagah bhi jail hi he
 Now they are sitting there waiting for the final decision
 ichhadhari babasamajh main nahin aata ki aise baabaaon ke bhakt bhi kaise-kaise hai? ab bhala koi baba nagin dance kare or bhakt andhe hokar been bajaaen to phir baba ko hi akele dosha kyon? ye to mashhoor hi apane naam se ho gaye the
 Baba Desired ab jab harakatein aisi hongi to aadaten bhi vahi hongi
 These Baba made his ashram the base of the Ayyashi
 ilzaam he ki ashram se ladkiyaan supplai karte the
 Currently in jail
 mukadmaa jari he
 Radhe is a mother of the mambabas, although they are free
 lekin vivaadon kii qaid main hai
 In the name of faith, she offers such items to her devotees that even the devotee should be shy
 idhar phir surkhiyon main hai
 With his new videos and songs
 ilzaam in par bhi kai hai
 Everyone has understood their actions as well
 ilzaam se vaakif hi hai
 What are we waiting for

 Chandrashekhar Gaur, a resident and social activist from Neemuch district of Madhya Pradesh, had sought this information from the Right to Information Act, iit-roorkee, which has also been the organizing body for the JEE (advanced) examination this time
 unhone jaananaa chaha tha ki, deshbhar ke vividh iaiti sasthanon main varsh 2019 kii counselling prakriya (pravesh prakriya) puri hone ke baad kis iaiti main kul kitni siten khaali padi he evam in siton ko bharne ke liye kya prayaas kiye gaye hai
 In response to the application of Right to Information to Gaur, the Central Public Information Officer said that, the information sought is not available in the office of JEE Advanced, Roorkee
 yah jaankaree alag-alag santhaan se hasil kii ja sakati he or is aavedan ko iaiti-rudki ke acadmic afares offis ko agreshit kar di thi
 As per the information given by the Academic Affairs Office of IIT Roorkee, a total of 18 seats in the undergraduate program have remained vacant in the year 2019 despite the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee raising the last date of admission from 20 July 2019 to 31 July 2019

 In this, Rishi has criticized the directors of the film Jagga Jasoos and Bombay Velvet
 rishi ne ek intervyuu main kaha ki 'main jagga jasoos or bombai velvet kii asafalataa ko pachaa nahin paae hai
 Bombay Velvet was arguably a bad film
 aap anuraag kashyap ko paise de dijie unhen pataa bhi nahin chalata ki ise kaise kharch karnaa he
 Rishi Kapoor did not forget to mention the country in praise of Emraan Khan, Troll also, while doing evil of Anurag Basu's film Jagga Jasoos, he said- 'it was a bad film
 ekadam bakawaas film
 When i asked Ranbir about this, he said that i cannot doubt the person with whom i have worked in a film like Barfi
 'hiraani kii maa ke pairon main gir pade the rishi kapur, kaha-ranbir sang bhi karen film'maine is bich dekha ki usne is film ke liye kitni mehnat kii
 He used to come home late at night
 wo jaldi waapas shoot par chale jate the

 The British police officer John Saunders was killed to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai by the freedom fighters shaheed-e-azam Bhagat Singh and Rajguru
 british police adhikari jon sanders kii hatyah- wo din tha 17 disambar, 1928 kaa
 Bhagat Singh and Rajguru awaiting the British officer with full preparation
 32 mem kii semi automatic pistal colt se jon saunders kii goli markar hatya kar di thi
 If you believe the things recorded in history, then angry Bhagat Singh fired three bullets on Saunders even after killing him
 - kuch samay pehle hi jon saunders kii vysarai ke pie kii beti se sagaai hui thi
 The entire British system was set ablaze by the murder of son-in-law of Viceroy's PA
 - yah maamla 'lahore shadyantr cese' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 On March 23, 1931, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged in the Central Jail in Lahore

 - According to the FIR, the case was in the evening 4 December 17, 1928
 30 baje anaarakali police stesan par darj hua tha
 The copy of the FIR was written in Urdu
 - yah cese ipisi ke section 302, 1201 or 190 ke tahaj darj hua tha
 Shockingly, in 2014, the Lahore police provided an original copy of the FIR in the murder of Saunders in 1928
 is FIR main bhagat singh kaa naam nahin he, jabaki isi maamle main bhagat singh ko faansee di gai thi
 - Petitioner Qureshi, who had said that Bhagat Singh was proved innocent in this case, had told that the witnesses were not heard in this case
 bhagat singh ke vakeelon ko unki begunaahi sabit karne kaa mauka tak nahin diya gaya
 - The pistol with which John Saunders was murdered by Bhagat Singh was kept in the Central School of Weapons and Tactics (CSWT), Indore since 1969
 - is pistal ko 7 aktubar, 1969 ko 7 anya hathiyaaron ke saath punjab kii fillore sthit police academy se biguef ke indore sthit CSWT bhej diya gaya tha
 shaheed-e-azam Bhagat Singh's historic weapon will soon be displayed in the new Arms Museum, especially to pay special respect

 'it is noteworthy that Murthy had recently expressed displeasure over the quality of students who have completed their studies from iits and said that the selection process for admission to these reputed technology institutes needs to be changed
 sibbal ne kaha ki mantralay sambhavat: agle saal tak ‘neshnal vokational ajukational qualiphactional fremawork’ sthapit karne kii prakriya main juta hua he taaki chaatr apni ruchi ke mutabik pathyakram kaa chayan kar saken
 He also said that 26 new institutes are being set up all over Mumbai where the courses related to graphics will be taught
 unhone kota mudde par puche jane par kaha, ‘kota samaaj main baadha paidaa karne ke liye nahin he, balki yah samaaj ko jodne kaa jariya he
 The Pakistani cricket fans still did not get out of the shock of the crushing defeat from India that on Saturday, the West Indies team sprinkled salt on their burns
 world cap shuru hone se pehle quarter final main apni team kii jagah pakki dekh rahe paak phens ko jor kaa jhatka to laganaa hi tha
 We tell you how one such Pakistani fan and journalist Talha Ahmed of the newspaper 'don' expressed the pain of defeat to his team
 ahamed likhte hai ki pakistan main shanivaar ko jise bhi offis janaa padataa he, vah khud ko lucky nahin maanata
 But this Saturday was not so
 shanivaar ko pakistan ko westeindies se team se karaari haar mili or jinhone yah match nahin dekha hoga, wo khud ko lucky maan rahe honge
 Most people in Pakistan were still sleepy that West Indies cricketers started writing the script of Pakistan's defeat
 jo log apane tivi par najar gadaaye baithe the, apni team kaa sharmnaak pradarshan dekhakar unhen ronaa hi aa rahaa tha
 The Pakistanis had decided that their team's victory was confirmed as soon as Cris Gayle was out
 kris gail ko sirf 4 ke score par mohammad irfan ne pavilion kii raah dikhaa di thi, lekin iskaa bhi koi phayda nahin hua
 Ahmed writes, My mother had turned off the TV as soon as Gayle was out because she felt that there was nothing special left in the match
 lekin wo galat sabit huin
 The abuser Nasir Jamshed is also no less
 jinhen team main shaamil to paak ballebaaji ko majboot karne ke liye kiya gaya tha, lekin unhone na sirf kaich tapakaaya, balki chot bhi kha baithe
 Ahmed also got angry with Pakistan's most experienced batsman Younis Khan, who instead of working hard at batting, used his full strength to throw a throw at Dwayne Bravo's helmet and could not even open the account when it came to batting
 48wein over kii shuruyaat main westeindies kaa score chaar wicket par 258 ran tha, lekin sohail khan ne andre rasel se teen chakke padva die or wo bhi phens ke gusse kaa shikaar bane
 Ahmed has expressed his anger not just with words but also with photographs
 unhone ek photo share kii he, jisamen pakistani team kii batting dekh rahe phens gan lekar tivi screen par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 In another photo, Pakistani cricketers are pointing outside the grounds and the caption is on the photo - the way to the airport
 lagaataar do-do haar ke baad paak team apane group main sabase neeche pahunch gai he
 In such a situation, poor Pakistani fans have no option but to express their anger

 a Delhi court will decide next month whether to summon Union Minister Smriti Irani on a complaint against her for allegedly giving false information regarding her educational qualifications in an affidavit filed before the Election Commission to contest various elections
 metropolitan magistrate harvinder singh ne kaha ki aadesh taiyaar nahin he
 He was to pronounce his order on Thursday but fixed the next hearing date for the case on October 1
 tippaniyan The court had on September 3 reserved its order after studying the arguments given by complainant and freelance writer Ahmar Khan and the report submitted by the Election Commission and Delhi University regarding Irani's academic degree
 chunaav ayog kii taraf se upasthit ek adhikari ne isse pehle adaalat se kaha tha ki shaikshanik yogyata ke sambandh main irani dwaara daayar dastavej kaa pataa nahin chal rahaa he

 2008 ke maalegaanv blast maamle main supreme court main harsh mandar or peediton kii yachika par sunwaayee se justise yuyuu lalit ne khud ko alag kar liya
 He said that in this case he had pleaded some accused

 The comments mandar kii yachika main maang kii gai thi ki NIA court main sarkaar kii ore se pairvi ke liye kisi nami vakil kii vishesh sarkari vakil ke taur par niyukti kii jaae
 Also, it was said that a CBI SIT should be constituted which should investigate under the supervision of the court and on whose orders, the case lawyer Rohini Salian was ordered to be soft during the trial
 janhit yachika main aarope lagaaya gaya ki enie ke adhikariyon ne sambhavat: apane 'raajnneetik aakaaon' ke nirdesh par maamle main purvavarti vishesh lok abhiyojak rohinee salian par dabaav daalaa tha

 For the last two years i have been reading news related to the bank with interest
 chairamainon ke intervyuu se baaten to badi badi lagati thim lekin bank ke bheetar kii ve samasyaayein kabhi nahin dikhin jo banker ke jivan main bahut badi ho gai hai
 Talking to hundreds of bankers during the Bank Series, our life today has seen that horrific picture that we know, but we have forgotten that it is a pain
 ise ek had ke baad saha nahin janaa chahie
 Our relationship is so broken that as soon as someone says his grief, we start seeing him from the point of view of Hikrat
 hamen pataa hi nahin chalata ki ham jis nazar se kisi ko dekh rahe hai, koi hamen bhi us nazar se dekh rahaa hota he
 During the Bank Series, bankers told their story keeping their face and name behind
 ghar se dur, raat raat bhar bainkon main kaam karnaa, target kaa tanaav, jhooth or jhaanse ke aadhaar par beemaa policy bechnaa taaki koi un aankadon ko apni kamyaabi bataa sake
 If our systems were really sensitive then the bank would have taken any step on this rottenness within the system
 koi faisla karata
 Whenever a problem occurs, the system waits for the second problem, so that the first problem can be overcome
 isi tarah aap dekhenge ki bharat bhar main lakhon log dharna pradarshan kar loktantric hone kaa apana farz to nibhaa dete hai or system sadak se aa rahi awaz ko nahin sunata he
 The bankers, who were hiding their names and faces till yesterday, were speaking
 apni yatnaa ke saath kisi andhere main chhipe the, aaj usee andhere ke rang kaa tii shart pahanakar ujaale main aa gaye
 Now you can see them, know their names, hear them while speaking
 kaale tii shart main jamaa hue banker sirf selary ke liye awaz nahin laga rahe hai balki bainkon ke bheetar tanaav kaa jo jaal buna gaya he usase nikalne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 v Bankers is the new group, mostly young
 ve bankers kaa maananaa he ki unki selary centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke baraabar kii jaae
 When the chairman and executive director get the salary according to the Seventh Pay Commission, why is the banker not getting it
 agar aisa he to is baat main bahut dam he
 The senior officer should get salary under some other arrangement and the rest should get such low salary, it should be arranged
 mujhe nahin lagata he ki koi bhi is tark ko sweekaar karegaa, kam se kam chairman or kaaryakari nideshko apni selary saatven vetan ayog ke hisaab se nahin leni chahie thi kyonki unke maatahat afasaron ko us hisaab se selary nahin milti he
 The group consists of not just young bankers but also ex-servicemen bankers and a large number of people working in rural banks
 jinka kahana he ki 30,000 logon ko pension tak nahin mil rahi he
 Those who get only get 1800 a month
 yah tasviir dilli kii he magar aaj bharat ke kai ilaakon main bankeron ne aisa hi pradarshan kiya he
 Torture has entered the lives of over 1
3 million bankers
 ve apane aap ko bandhua kehane lage hai
 Don't assume that there are bankers in Delhi
 desh bhar ke kai jagahon se banker apane kharche se is dharna main shaamil hone aae
 We have seen one thing
 aap saare darvaaze band kar den, awaz apane liye daravaaza khol leti he
 The arrival of these bankers at Jantar Mantar and telling their story was not different from the story being told in secret for the last three weeks
 hamane unke saikadon patron ko padhaa he
 It has been said that whether it is a man or a woman banker, all are suffering from one disease, most of the disease is due to work stress
 biimaar to hai magar ilaaj ke liye chuttee nahin milti hai
 i wonder how millions of bankers were tolerating such exploitation
 kaise ve apane riginal manager se gaali sun rahe the, ve kiske liye us jhooth ko ji rahe the jo unke zamir par boj ban rahaa tha
 Initially no one had the courage to speak
 nahin bolne kii samskruti kab loksamskruti kaa hissaa ban jaati he, hamen pataa kyon nahin chalata he
 We do not say that everything is happening because of our series, but gradually the bankers start to show their faces
 pehle unhone baij pahana ki ham banker hai or hamaari tankhwaah kam he
 Then they started wearing hats
 pehle ikkaa dukka bankeron ne isaki shuruyaat kii or jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya apni maangon kii topi pahanakar or takhti lekar badi sankhya main banker jamaa hone lage
 i could see that it was taking courage
 mujhe yah nahin dikhaa ki ye jantar mantar pahunch jaaenge, nahin pahunch paaenge to apane apane shaharon main candal march karenge
 During journalism, we have gone through the horrors of the people, but it was difficult to remain normal after listening to the problems faced by women bankers
 mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he jab shuru main kuch mahila bankeron se poocha tha to koi bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 As soon as two or three women were talked about in prime time, their talk got flooded
 maine bahuton se baat kii he
 It is also understood that everything is not right where you work, keeping it aside that what was clearly shown was not worth mentioning
 ek samaaj ke taur par hamane mahila bankeron ke saath jo hone diya he vah sharmnaak he
 It is even more shameful that the women bankers have allowed themselves to be with them
 aap ndtv
 Go to in, there will be a strip of bank series, all the points will be opened as soon as it is clicked
 aap 8 march kaa episod dekhiegaa
 You will know what is happening to women bankers under the guise of office rules
 raat ke nau baje branch main baithi hai or ghar main baccha biimaar he, tab bhi ghar jane nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The demand letter of v bankers also includes a demand for female bankers to be discharged as per the rules of the central government
 isliye ve bankers ke saath noujvaan mahilaayein khub ai thim
 She was constantly messaging that there are no reports of our dharna on any channel
 wo bhul gayi ki unhone bhi to kisi channel par kisi kisaan kii takalif ko nahin dekha, kisi chaatr kii takalif ko nahin dekha hoga, to unki takalif ko dekhne or dikhaane vaale kaise hote
 It is good that they understood that in democracy many times the number has no value
 unhen is hairaani kaa anubhav hona chahie tha ki teen hazaar kii sankhya main jamaa hone ke baad bhi koi tivi vaala nahin aata he
 Now the news channel does not come for the people, goes to the people for power or rejects the people
 magar mahila bankeron ke liye ab apni vyathaa ko dabaa kar rakhana asambhav hota ja rahaa he
 Today a female banker has written that after our series, her branch has been investigated
 safai or shauchalay ko lekar
 We told you that women bankers were also deliberately sent to a branch where there is no toilet
 ajeeb he
 The analysis that appears in the English newspaper for the middle class is that the labor law should be reformed
 ve bankers yani bainkon main kaam karne vaala middle class maang kar rahaa he ki lebar lau ko lagu kiya jaae, kaam karne ke ghante tay hon, der raat tak rokane par vaapasi kaa intazaam kiya jaae or saptaah main 5 din kaa hi kaam ho
 You must have read in the newspapers that banks will be closed for five days
 khabar to chap jaati he magar yah nahin chhapati he ki un paanch dinon main bhi banker bank jate hai
 Bankers work without leave for several months
 shanivaar ko to jate hi hai, ravivaar ko bhi janaa padataa he
 Work stress within banks has increased significantly
 iske alaava unki maang he ki 'transfar niti main sudhaar kiya jaae, iskaa aatank kam kiya jaae
 Immoral pressure to end wrong loans should be eliminated
 nai pension niti ko samaapt kar puraani pension niti lagu kii jaae
 Minimum wages are applicable for boys working in canteen
 ' Look at these demands carefully, the hollowness within the bank system will be seen
 canteen bvaay yaa chaparasi asthai rup se kaam karte hai
 They get anywhere from 100 to 200 rupees
 court kaa aadesh he ki jo bhi asthai he use vahi vetan milegaa jo sthai ko miltaa he
 a peon has written that if he is not caught on paper, he has to pay money under different names
 aap kehete hai ki aadhaar number laga dene se bhrashtachar mit jayega
 It will be fixed, it will be fixed
 ve backers nayaa sanghathan he, puraane union hai
 There is a difference in demand between the two
 purana union chahta he ki union or indian bank associshan se milakar bainkon ke hisaab se selary tay ho
 We bankers say that we are government banks, so why are we not government employees
 isliye hamen vahi selary mili jo centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ko milti he
 v Bankers says that apart from this one difference is no different from them
 ve bankers kii maang bataati he ki kaala tishart pahan kar bhi un maangon ko uthaaya ja saktaa he jinke uthaane par iti cell aapako communist kah saktaa he
 You change color, but you get thousands of people doing contract jobs who are broke
 unke paas kuch nahin bachaa he
 Therefore, they are opposing the new pension policy
 duusare peshey ke log bhi kar rahe hai
 But no one is fighting together, all are fighting separately on the question of pension
 jantar mantar par pichley hafte railway union ke log bhi aae the ve bhi nai pension niti kaa virodh kar rahe the
 At Jantar Mantar, these young bankers came to fight not only for themselves, but also for unemployed India
 inkaa kahana he ki bainkon main kaaphi jagah khaali hai
 a man is working three to four men
 agar bhartee ho to badi sankhya main yuvaaon ko rojgaar mil saktaa he
 The condition of people who have retired from Grameen Bank is very bad
 jo kaam kar rahe hai unka to he hi
 Retired but getting pension 1800
 koi inaki sun nahin rahaa
 Officers from Grameen Bank across the country participated in Wednesday's demonstration
 bihar gramin bank kii bhi apni bhayankar samasyaayein hai
 We showed last time how the order comes that one should not go out of the district after falling ill for treatment
 hamaare dikhaane ke baad aadesh kii bhashaa badalati he
 But there is also a lot of problem of his salary
 pehle sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe the magar ab ek saath aane lage hai
 Many branches do not have staff, work is going on with the same staff
 daftar kii suvidhaayen kharaab hai or yahaan bhi beemaa bechney kaa dabaav he or galat tareeke se lone dene kaa
 The comments inaki hi nahin bhootpurv sainik bankeron kii bhi koi nahin sun rahaa he
 While they will be at least patriotic
 godi media kaa ankar unhen to deshodrohi bhi nahin kah saktaa he
 Ask any central government or state government employee
 nai bhartee ho nahin rahi he or jo bache hai ve kaam ke dabaav se maare ja rahe hai
 We will also review the Ministry of Railways from the inside next month, as has been done by the bank sector
 acha lagata he ki hamaari series railway ke trek par kaam karne vaale gangamain tak pahunchane lagi he
 When the gangmen start writing you letters, you can understand that you are on the right track
 gramin dak seva vaale dhiraj rakhen, unki baat uthaai jaaegi, magar sab apana apana tivi par dekhenge to system chaalaak he
 Breakup will happen, so first fight for others, then fight for yourself
 aisa lagata he ki system ke bheetar koi kisi kii nahin sun rahaa he
 When we start writing the drivers of the railway, then understand that there is something that even after all the efforts to suppress the voice within the system, people have started coming out
 abhi or aegi
 Our series is also impacting people's conscience
 ek banker ne likhaa he ki dabaav daalaa jaataa he ki jo bhi bank main aae, uskaa mobile lekar bhim ap downlod karnaa he
 Many people do not want to give mobile but they have to download ten to twenty Bhima app or else they get scolded
 ek ne bataaya ki bank esemes dene ke liye aapse paise letaa he
 Takes money from all consumers
 magar sabhi upabhoktaaon ko yah seva nahin milti he
 The bankers are shocked to see these disturbances happening inside
 hamaare paas koi system nahin he jiske aadhaar par kuch pukhta jaankaree mil sake or karrwai ho
 Today someone showed an order which said that the banker would not sell insurance to anyone on the basis of lies or half-information
 kagaz par likhaa he kyonki pataa chal gaya he ki koi kudaal lekar baith gaya he, bainkon ke bheetar kii gandi mitti ko baahar laane ke liye
 Abuse on mobile phones is reducing, but the pressure of target has not reduced
 jiske chalate unhen vahi kaam karnaa pad rahaa he
 Today, Uday Kotak has read the statement that the second flood of loan to NPA is coming from the small medium industries sector
 bank siries main kai bankeron ne bataaya ki ve majaboor kiye ja rahe hai ki mudra ke tahat lone dene ke liye
 It is being given to people who do not even want to take and are not able to take it
 behatar he ham pehle satark ho jaaen
 The bankers, who were hiding their names and faces till yesterday, were speaking
 apni yatnaa ke saath kisi andhere main chhipe the, aaj usee andhere ke rang kaa tii shart pahanakar ujaale main aa gaye
 Now you can see them, know their names, hear them while speaking
 kaale tii shart main jamaa hue banker sirf selary ke liye awaz nahin laga rahe hai balki bainkon ke bheetar tanaav kaa jo jaal buna gaya he usase nikalne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 v Bankers is the new group, mostly young
 ve bankers kaa maananaa he ki unki selary centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ke baraabar kii jaae
 When the chairman and executive director get the salary according to the Seventh Pay Commission, why is the banker not getting it
 agar aisa he to is baat main bahut dam he
 The senior officer should get salary under some other arrangement and the rest should get such low salary, it should be arranged
 mujhe nahin lagata he ki koi bhi is tark ko sweekaar karegaa, kam se kam chairman or kaaryakari nideshko apni selary saatven vetan ayog ke hisaab se nahin leni chahie thi kyonki unke maatahat afasaron ko us hisaab se selary nahin milti he
 The group consists of not just young bankers but also ex-servicemen bankers and a large number of people working in rural banks
 jinka kahana he ki 30,000 logon ko pension tak nahin mil rahi he
 Those who get only get 1800 a month
 yah tasviir dilli kii he magar aaj bharat ke kai ilaakon main bankeron ne aisa hi pradarshan kiya he
 Torture has entered the lives of over 1
3 million bankers
 ve apane aap ko bandhua kehane lage hai
 Don't assume that there are bankers in Delhi
 desh bhar ke kai jagahon se banker apane kharche se is dharna main shaamil hone aae
 We have seen one thing
 aap saare darvaaze band kar den, awaz apane liye daravaaza khol leti he
 The arrival of these bankers at Jantar Mantar and telling their story was not different from the story being told in secret for the last three weeks
 hamane unke saikadon patron ko padhaa he
 It has been said that whether it is a man or a woman banker, all are suffering from one disease, most of the disease is due to work stress
 biimaar to hai magar ilaaj ke liye chuttee nahin milti hai
 i wonder how millions of bankers were tolerating such exploitation
 kaise ve apane riginal manager se gaali sun rahe the, ve kiske liye us jhooth ko ji rahe the jo unke zamir par boj ban rahaa tha
 Initially no one had the courage to speak
 nahin bolne kii samskruti kab loksamskruti kaa hissaa ban jaati he, hamen pataa kyon nahin chalata he
 We do not say that everything is happening because of our series, but gradually the bankers start to show their faces
 pehle unhone baij pahana ki ham banker hai or hamaari tankhwaah kam he
 Then they started wearing hats
 pehle ikkaa dukka bankeron ne isaki shuruyaat kii or jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya apni maangon kii topi pahanakar or takhti lekar badi sankhya main banker jamaa hone lage
 i could see that it was taking courage
 mujhe yah nahin dikhaa ki ye jantar mantar pahunch jaaenge, nahin pahunch paaenge to apane apane shaharon main candal march karenge
 During journalism, we have gone through the horrors of the people, but it was difficult to remain normal after listening to the problems faced by women bankers
 mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he jab shuru main kuch mahila bankeron se poocha tha to koi bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 As soon as two or three women were talked about in prime time, their talk got flooded
 maine bahuton se baat kii he
 It is also understood that everything is not right where you work, keeping it aside that what was clearly shown was not worth mentioning
 ek samaaj ke taur par hamane mahila bankeron ke saath jo hone diya he vah sharmnaak he
 It is even more shameful that the women bankers have allowed themselves to be with them
 aap ndtv
 Go to in, there will be a strip of bank series, all the points will be opened as soon as it is clicked
 aap 8 march kaa episod dekhiegaa
 You will know what is happening to women bankers under the guise of office rules
 raat ke nau baje branch main baithi hai or ghar main baccha biimaar he, tab bhi ghar jane nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The demand letter of v bankers also includes a demand for female bankers to be discharged as per the rules of the central government
 isliye ve bankers ke saath noujvaan mahilaayein khub ai thim
 She was constantly messaging that there are no reports of our dharna on any channel
 wo bhul gayi ki unhone bhi to kisi channel par kisi kisaan kii takalif ko nahin dekha, kisi chaatr kii takalif ko nahin dekha hoga, to unki takalif ko dekhne or dikhaane vaale kaise hote
 It is good that they understood that in democracy many times the number has no value
 unhen is hairaani kaa anubhav hona chahie tha ki teen hazaar kii sankhya main jamaa hone ke baad bhi koi tivi vaala nahin aata he
 Now the news channel does not come for the people, goes to the people for power or rejects the people
 magar mahila bankeron ke liye ab apni vyathaa ko dabaa kar rakhana asambhav hota ja rahaa he
 Today a female banker has written that after our series, her branch has been investigated
 safai or shauchalay ko lekar
 We told you that women bankers were also deliberately sent to a branch where there is no toilet
 ajeeb he
 The analysis that appears in the English newspaper for the middle class is that the labor law should be reformed
 ve bankers yani bainkon main kaam karne vaala middle class maang kar rahaa he ki lebar lau ko lagu kiya jaae, kaam karne ke ghante tay hon, der raat tak rokane par vaapasi kaa intazaam kiya jaae or saptaah main 5 din kaa hi kaam ho
 You must have read in the newspapers that banks will be closed for five days
 khabar to chap jaati he magar yah nahin chhapati he ki un paanch dinon main bhi banker bank jate hai
 Bankers work without leave for several months
 shanivaar ko to jate hi hai, ravivaar ko bhi janaa padataa he
 Work stress within banks has increased significantly
 iske alaava unki maang he ki 'transfar niti main sudhaar kiya jaae, iskaa aatank kam kiya jaae
 Immoral pressure to end wrong loans should be eliminated
 nai pension niti ko samaapt kar puraani pension niti lagu kii jaae
 Minimum wages are applicable for boys working in canteen
 ' Look at these demands carefully, the hollowness within the bank system will be seen
 canteen bvaay yaa chaparasi asthai rup se kaam karte hai
 They get anywhere from 100 to 200 rupees
 court kaa aadesh he ki jo bhi asthai he use vahi vetan milegaa jo sthai ko miltaa he
 a peon has written that if he is not caught on paper, he has to pay money under different names
 aap kehete hai ki aadhaar number laga dene se bhrashtachar mit jayega
 It will be fixed, it will be fixed
 ve backers nayaa sanghathan he, puraane union hai
 There is a difference in demand between the two
 purana union chahta he ki union or indian bank associshan se milakar bainkon ke hisaab se selary tay ho
 We bankers say that we are government banks, so why are we not government employees
 isliye hamen vahi selary mili jo centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ko milti he
 v Bankers says that apart from this one difference is no different from them
 ve bankers kii maang bataati he ki kaala tishart pahan kar bhi un maangon ko uthaaya ja saktaa he jinke uthaane par iti cell aapako communist kah saktaa he
 You change color, but you get thousands of people doing contract jobs who are broke
 unke paas kuch nahin bachaa he
 Therefore, they are opposing the new pension policy
 duusare peshey ke log bhi kar rahe hai
 But no one is fighting together, all are fighting separately on the question of pension
 jantar mantar par pichley hafte railway union ke log bhi aae the ve bhi nai pension niti kaa virodh kar rahe the
 At Jantar Mantar, these young bankers came to fight not only for themselves, but also for unemployed India
 inkaa kahana he ki bainkon main kaaphi jagah khaali hai
 a man is working three to four men
 agar bhartee ho to badi sankhya main yuvaaon ko rojgaar mil saktaa he
 The condition of people who have retired from Grameen Bank is very bad
 jo kaam kar rahe hai unka to he hi
 Retired but getting pension 1800
 koi inaki sun nahin rahaa
 Officers from Grameen Bank across the country participated in Wednesday's demonstration
 bihar gramin bank kii bhi apni bhayankar samasyaayein hai
 We showed last time how the order comes that one should not go out of the district after falling ill for treatment
 hamaare dikhaane ke baad aadesh kii bhashaa badalati he
 But there is also a lot of problem of his salary
 pehle sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe the magar ab ek saath aane lage hai
 Many branches do not have staff, work is going on with the same staff
 daftar kii suvidhaayen kharaab hai or yahaan bhi beemaa bechney kaa dabaav he or galat tareeke se lone dene kaa
 The comments inaki hi nahin bhootpurv sainik bankeron kii bhi koi nahin sun rahaa he
 While they will be at least patriotic
 godi media kaa ankar unhen to deshodrohi bhi nahin kah saktaa he
 Ask any central government or state government employee
 nai bhartee ho nahin rahi he or jo bache hai ve kaam ke dabaav se maare ja rahe hai
 We will also review the Ministry of Railways from the inside next month, as has been done by the bank sector
 acha lagata he ki hamaari series railway ke trek par kaam karne vaale gangamain tak pahunchane lagi he
 When the gangmen start writing you letters, you can understand that you are on the right track
 gramin dak seva vaale dhiraj rakhen, unki baat uthaai jaaegi, magar sab apana apana tivi par dekhenge to system chaalaak he
 Breakup will happen, so first fight for others, then fight for yourself
 aisa lagata he ki system ke bheetar koi kisi kii nahin sun rahaa he
 When we start writing the drivers of the railway, then understand that there is something that even after all the efforts to suppress the voice within the system, people have started coming out
 abhi or aegi
 Our series is also impacting people's conscience
 ek banker ne likhaa he ki dabaav daalaa jaataa he ki jo bhi bank main aae, uskaa mobile lekar bhim ap downlod karnaa he
 Many people do not want to give mobile but they have to download ten to twenty Bhima app or else they get scolded
 ek ne bataaya ki bank esemes dene ke liye aapse paise letaa he
 Takes money from all consumers
 magar sabhi upabhoktaaon ko yah seva nahin milti he
 The bankers are shocked to see these disturbances happening inside
 hamaare paas koi system nahin he jiske aadhaar par kuch pukhta jaankaree mil sake or karrwai ho
 Today someone showed an order which said that the banker would not sell insurance to anyone on the basis of lies or half-information
 kagaz par likhaa he kyonki pataa chal gaya he ki koi kudaal lekar baith gaya he, bainkon ke bheetar kii gandi mitti ko baahar laane ke liye
 Abuse on mobile phones is reducing, but the pressure of target has not reduced
 jiske chalate unhen vahi kaam karnaa pad rahaa he
 Today, Uday Kotak has read the statement that the second flood of loan to NPA is coming from the small medium industries sector

 bank siries main kai bankeron ne bataaya ki ve majaboor kiye ja rahe hai ki mudra ke tahat lone dene ke liye
 It is being given to people who do not even want to take and are not able to take it
 behatar he ham pehle satark ho jaaen
 During journalism, we have gone through the horrors of the people, but it was difficult to remain normal after listening to the problems faced by women bankers
 mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he jab shuru main kuch mahila bankeron se poocha tha to koi bolne ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 As soon as two or three women were talked about in prime time, their talk got flooded
 maine bahuton se baat kii he
 It is also understood that everything is not right where you work, keeping it aside that what was clearly shown was not worth mentioning
 ek samaaj ke taur par hamane mahila bankeron ke saath jo hone diya he vah sharmnaak he
 It is even more shameful that the women bankers have allowed themselves to be with them
 aap ndtv
 Go to in, there will be a strip of bank series, all the points will be opened as soon as it is clicked
 aap 8 march kaa episod dekhiegaa
 You will know what is happening to women bankers under the guise of office rules
 raat ke nau baje branch main baithi hai or ghar main baccha biimaar he, tab bhi ghar jane nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The demand letter of v bankers also includes a demand for female bankers to be discharged as per the rules of the central government
 isliye ve bankers ke saath noujvaan mahilaayein khub ai thim
 She was constantly messaging that there are no reports of our dharna on any channel
 wo bhul gayi ki unhone bhi to kisi channel par kisi kisaan kii takalif ko nahin dekha, kisi chaatr kii takalif ko nahin dekha hoga, to unki takalif ko dekhne or dikhaane vaale kaise hote
 It is good that they understood that in democracy many times the number has no value
 unhen is hairaani kaa anubhav hona chahie tha ki teen hazaar kii sankhya main jamaa hone ke baad bhi koi tivi vaala nahin aata he
 Now the news channel does not come for the people, goes to the people for power or rejects the people
 magar mahila bankeron ke liye ab apni vyathaa ko dabaa kar rakhana asambhav hota ja rahaa he
 Today a female banker has written that after our series, her branch has been investigated
 safai or shauchalay ko lekar
 We told you that women bankers were also deliberately sent to a branch where there is no toilet
 ajeeb he
 The analysis that appears in the English newspaper for the middle class is that the labor law should be reformed
 ve bankers yani bainkon main kaam karne vaala middle class maang kar rahaa he ki lebar lau ko lagu kiya jaae, kaam karne ke ghante tay hon, der raat tak rokane par vaapasi kaa intazaam kiya jaae or saptaah main 5 din kaa hi kaam ho
 You must have read in the newspapers that banks will be closed for five days
 khabar to chap jaati he magar yah nahin chhapati he ki un paanch dinon main bhi banker bank jate hai
 Bankers work without leave for several months
 shanivaar ko to jate hi hai, ravivaar ko bhi janaa padataa he
 Work stress within banks has increased significantly
 iske alaava unki maang he ki 'transfar niti main sudhaar kiya jaae, iskaa aatank kam kiya jaae
 Immoral pressure to end wrong loans should be eliminated
 nai pension niti ko samaapt kar puraani pension niti lagu kii jaae
 Minimum wages are applicable for boys working in canteen
 ' Look at these demands carefully, the hollowness within the bank system will be seen
 canteen bvaay yaa chaparasi asthai rup se kaam karte hai
 They get anywhere from 100 to 200 rupees
 court kaa aadesh he ki jo bhi asthai he use vahi vetan milegaa jo sthai ko miltaa he
 a peon has written that if he is not caught on paper, he has to pay money under different names
 aap kehete hai ki aadhaar number laga dene se bhrashtachar mit jayega
 It will be fixed, it will be fixed
 ve backers nayaa sanghathan he, puraane union hai
 There is a difference in demand between the two
 purana union chahta he ki union or indian bank associshan se milakar bainkon ke hisaab se selary tay ho
 We bankers say that we are government banks, so why are we not government employees
 isliye hamen vahi selary mili jo centre sarkaar ke karmchaariyon ko milti he
 v Bankers says that apart from this one difference is no different from them
 ve bankers kii maang bataati he ki kaala tishart pahan kar bhi un maangon ko uthaaya ja saktaa he jinke uthaane par iti cell aapako communist kah saktaa he
 You change color, but you get thousands of people doing contract jobs who are broke
 unke paas kuch nahin bachaa he
 Therefore, they are opposing the new pension policy
 duusare peshey ke log bhi kar rahe hai
 But no one is fighting together, all are fighting separately on the question of pension
 jantar mantar par pichley hafte railway union ke log bhi aae the ve bhi nai pension niti kaa virodh kar rahe the
 At Jantar Mantar, these young bankers came to fight not only for themselves, but also for unemployed India
 inkaa kahana he ki bainkon main kaaphi jagah khaali hai
 a man is working three to four men
 agar bhartee ho to badi sankhya main yuvaaon ko rojgaar mil saktaa he
 The condition of people who have retired from Grameen Bank is very bad
 jo kaam kar rahe hai unka to he hi
 Retired but getting pension 1800
 koi inaki sun nahin rahaa
 Officers from Grameen Bank across the country participated in Wednesday's demonstration
 bihar gramin bank kii bhi apni bhayankar samasyaayein hai
 We showed last time how the order comes that one should not go out of the district after falling ill for treatment
 hamaare dikhaane ke baad aadesh kii bhashaa badalati he
 But there is also a lot of problem of his salary
 pehle sab apni apni ladaai lard rahe the magar ab ek saath aane lage hai
 Many branches do not have staff, work is going on with the same staff
 daftar kii suvidhaayen kharaab hai or yahaan bhi beemaa bechney kaa dabaav he or galat tareeke se lone dene kaa
 The comments inaki hi nahin bhootpurv sainik bankeron kii bhi koi nahin sun rahaa he
 While they will be at least patriotic
 godi media kaa ankar unhen to deshodrohi bhi nahin kah saktaa he
 Ask any central government or state government employee
 nai bhartee ho nahin rahi he or jo bache hai ve kaam ke dabaav se maare ja rahe hai
 We will also review the Ministry of Railways from the inside next month, as has been done by the bank sector
 acha lagata he ki hamaari series railway ke trek par kaam karne vaale gangamain tak pahunchane lagi he
 When the gangmen start writing you letters, you can understand that you are on the right track
 gramin dak seva vaale dhiraj rakhen, unki baat uthaai jaaegi, magar sab apana apana tivi par dekhenge to system chaalaak he
 Breakup will happen, so first fight for others, then fight for yourself
 aisa lagata he ki system ke bheetar koi kisi kii nahin sun rahaa he
 When we start writing the drivers of the railway, then understand that there is something that even after all the efforts to suppress the voice within the system, people have started coming out
 abhi or aegi
 Our series is also impacting people's conscience
 ek banker ne likhaa he ki dabaav daalaa jaataa he ki jo bhi bank main aae, uskaa mobile lekar bhim ap downlod karnaa he
 Many people do not want to give mobile but they have to download ten to twenty Bhima app or else they get scolded
 ek ne bataaya ki bank esemes dene ke liye aapse paise letaa he
 Takes money from all consumers
 magar sabhi upabhoktaaon ko yah seva nahin milti he
 The bankers are shocked to see these disturbances happening inside
 hamaare paas koi system nahin he jiske aadhaar par kuch pukhta jaankaree mil sake or karrwai ho
 Today someone showed an order which said that the banker would not sell insurance to anyone on the basis of lies or half-information
 kagaz par likhaa he kyonki pataa chal gaya he ki koi kudaal lekar baith gaya he, bainkon ke bheetar kii gandi mitti ko baahar laane ke liye
 Abuse on mobile phones is reducing, but the pressure of target has not reduced
 jiske chalate unhen vahi kaam karnaa pad rahaa he
 Today, Uday Kotak has read the statement that the second flood of loan to NPA is coming from the small medium industries sector
 bank siries main kai bankeron ne bataaya ki ve majaboor kiye ja rahe hai ki mudra ke tahat lone dene ke liye
 It is being given to people who do not even want to take and are not able to take it
 behatar he ham pehle satark ho jaaen
 That is why young women came with v bankers
 wo lagaataar massej kar rahi thim ki kisi channel par hamaare dharne kii report nahin hai
 She forgot that she too had not seen the sufferings of any farmer on any channel, and would not have seen the suffering of any student, so how would they have seen and shown their suffering
 acha hua ki unhen yah baat samaj ai ki loktantr main kai baar sankhya kii koi keemat nahin hoti he
 He should have experienced the surprise that even after accumulating three thousand, no TV person comes
 ab news channel logon ke liye nahin aata he, satta ke liye logon ke paas jaataa he yaa logon ko hi riject kar detaa he
 But it is now becoming impossible for women bankers to keep their agony under control
 aaj ek mahila banker ne likhaa he ki hamaari series ke baad unke branch kii jaanch hui he
 Regarding cleaning and toilet
 hamane aapako bataaya tha ki mahila bankeron ko bhi jaanboojh kar aise branch main bheja jaataa tha jahaan shauchalay hi nahin he
 is peculiar
 middle class ke liye jo angrezi akhbaar main vishleshan chhapata he usamen yahi hota he ki lebar lau ko riform kiya jaae
 v Bankers, the middle class working in banks, is demanding that the labor law be enforced, working hours are fixed, late night stay should be arranged for return and work for 5 days a week
 aap akhabaaron main padhate honge ki paanch din bank band honge
 The news is published but it is not published that even in those five days, the bankers go to the bank
 banker kai maheenon tak bina chuttee ke kaam karte hai
 We go on Saturday, have to go on Sunday also
 bainkon ke bheetar kaam kaa tanaav kaaphi bad gaya he
 Apart from this, they demand that the transfer policy should be improved, its terror should be reduced
 galat lone manzur karne ke liye aniatik dabaav ko samaapt kiya jaae
 The old pension policy should be implemented after ending the new pension policy
 canteen main kaam karne vaale ladakon ke liye nunatam mazaduri lagu ho
 ' aap in maangon ko gaur se dekhie, bank system ke bheetar kaa khokhlaapan nazar aayega
 Canteen boys or peons work temporarily
 inhen kahin 100 se to kahin 200 rupee milte hai
 The court orders that whoever is temporary will get the same salary as the permanent one
 ek chaparasi ne likhaa he ki kahin ve kaagaj par pakade na jaaen isliye use alag alag naam se paise kaa bhugtan hota he
 You say that corruption will be eradicated by putting Aadhaar number
 ye thik ho jayega, wo thik ho jayega
 v backers are new organizations, old unions
 donon kii maang main antar he
 The old union wants that the union and the Indian Bank Association should decide the salary according to the banks
 ve bankers kaa kahana he ki ham sarkari bank hai to ham sarkari karmchaaree kyon nahin hai
 Therefore, we get the same salary as the central government employees
 ve bankers kaa kahana he ki is ek antar ke alaava unase alag nahin hai
 The demand of v bankers states that those demands can be raised even by wearing black T-shirt whose IT cell can call you communist
 aap rang badal len magar theke kii naukari karne vaale hazaron log milte hai jo tut chuke hai
 They have nothing left
 isliye ye nai pension niti kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 People of other professions are also doing it
 magar koi mil kar nahin lard rahaa, sab pension ke sawaal par alag alag lard rahe hai
 Railway union people also came to Jantar Mantar last week, they were also opposing the new pension policy
 jantar-mantar par ye noujvaan banker apane liye nahin, balki berojgaar bharat ke liye bhi ladane aae the
 They say that there is a lot of vacancy in banks
 ek aadmi teen se chaar aadmi kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 If admitted, a large number of youth can get employment
 gramin bank se ritair hue logon kaa haal bahut bura he
 Those who are working are there
 ritair kar chuke hai magar pension mil rahaa he 1800
 Nobody is listening to them
 buudhvaar ke pradarshan main desh bhar ke gramin bank ke afasar karmchaaree shaamil hue
 Bihar Gramin Bank also has its own problems
 hamane pichhali baar dikhaaya tha ki kaise aadesh aata he ki biimaar padane par zile se baahar nahin janaa he ilaaj ke liye
 The language of the order changes after we show it
 magar inaki selary kii bhi bahut samasya he
 Earlier everyone was fighting their own battles but now they are coming together
 kai shakhaon main staff nahin he, ek hi staff ke bharose kaam chal rahaa he
 The office facilities are poor and here too there is pressure to sell insurance and give loans incorrectly
 tippaniyan No one is listening to their ex-servicemen bankers
 jabaki ve to kam se kam deshbhakt honge hi
 The anchor of the dock media cannot even call him a traitor
 aap centre sarkaar yaa rajya sarkaar ke kisi bhi karmchaaree se puuchhie
 New recruits are not taking place and those who are left are being killed by work pressure
 ham agle maheene rail mantralay kii bhi bheetar se samiksha karenge jaise bank sector kii hui he
 It seems that our series has started reaching the gangmen working on the railway tracks
 jab gangamain aapako patr likhane lage to samaj sakate hai ki aap sahi raste par hai
 The people of the rural postal service should be patient, their point will be raised, but the system is clever if everyone sees their own TV
 golmaal kar jayega isliye pehle dusron ke liye ladiye, phir apane liye ladiye
 It seems that nobody within the system is listening to anyone
 jab hamen railway ke dryver likhane lagen to samajhie ki kuch to he ki system ke bheetar awaz dabaane kii tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi logon kii aah baahar aane lagi he
 More will come now
 hamaari is series kaa asar logon ke zamir par bhi pad rahaa he
 a banker has written that it is pressured that whoever comes to the bank, has to download the Bhima app with his mobile
 bahut log mobile nahin dena chaahate magar unase lekar das bees bhim ap downlod karnaa padataa he varanaa daant padati he
 One said that the bank takes money from you for sending SMS

 No one is listening to their ex-servicemen bankers
 jabaki ve to kam se kam deshbhakt honge hi
 The anchor of the dock media cannot even call him a traitor
 aap centre sarkaar yaa rajya sarkaar ke kisi bhi karmchaaree se puuchhie
 New recruits are not taking place and those who are left are being killed by work pressure
 ham agle maheene rail mantralay kii bhi bheetar se samiksha karenge jaise bank sector kii hui he
 It seems that our series has started reaching the gangmen working on the railway tracks
 jab gangamain aapako patr likhane lage to samaj sakate hai ki aap sahi raste par hai
 The people of the rural postal service should be patient, their point will be raised, but the system is clever if everyone sees their own TV
 golmaal kar jayega isliye pehle dusron ke liye ladiye, phir apane liye ladiye
 It seems that nobody within the system is listening to anyone
 jab hamen railway ke dryver likhane lagen to samajhie ki kuch to he ki system ke bheetar awaz dabaane kii tamaam koshishon ke baad bhi logon kii aah baahar aane lagi he
 More will come now
 hamaari is series kaa asar logon ke zamir par bhi pad rahaa he
 a banker has written that it is pressured that whoever comes to the bank, has to download the Bhima app with his mobile
 bahut log mobile nahin dena chaahate magar unase lekar das bees bhim ap downlod karnaa padataa he varanaa daant padati he
 One said that the bank takes money from you for sending SMS
 sabhi upabhoktaaon se paise letaa he
 But not all consumers get this service
 banker andar ho rahi in gadabadiyon ko dekhakar aahat hai
 We do not have any system based on which some concrete information can be obtained and action taken
 aaj kisi ne aadesh dikhaaya, jisamen kaha gaya he ki banker kisi ko jhooth bolkar yaa aadhi jaankaree ke aadhaar par beemaa nahin bechega
 It is written on paper because it is known that someone has sat down with a hoe, to bring out the dirt inside the banks
 mobile phone par gaali dena kam ho rahaa he magar target kaa dabaav kam nahin hua he
 Due to which they have to do the same thing
 aaj hi udai kotak kaa bayaan padhaa he ki lone ke enpie main ho jane kaa doosraa jaljla laghu madhyam udyogon ke sector se aa rahaa he
 Many bankers in the bank series said that they are being forced to give loans under the currency
 vaise logon ko diya ja rahaa he jo lenaa bhi nahin chaahate or lene ke yogya bhi nahin hai
 We better be cautious first
 aisa lagata he ki system ke bheetar koi kisi kii nahin sun rahaa he
 When we start writing the drivers of the railway, then understand that there is something that even after all the efforts to suppress the voice within the system, people have started coming out

 haryana ke faridabad jile main ek baar phir teacher or chaatra kaa rishta kalankit ho gaya
 Where a teacher allegedly indulged in indecent behavior with his minor student
 police ne chaatra kii shikaayat par maamla darj kar liya he
 According to the police spokesperson, a 15-year-old minor student, resident of Faridabad, lodged a complaint with the police stating that his school teacher, Zishan, called him to him on Wednesday and asked for his mobile number
 police ne bataaya ki chaatra ke mutabik teacher aksar use buree niyat se choota rahata he
 On the basis of the complaint, the police has registered a case against the accused and started investigation
 ek desh ek chunaav par lau kamishan ke purv adhyaksh justise balbir singh chouhan ne kaha ki ayog ne is babat vistrut varking dacument bhi jari kiya tha
 The Commission wanted that the issue should be taken directly from the political parties, constitution and legal experts as well as from the general public, so that whatever path comes out with the consent of all, it should be made part of the recommendation
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet ke dauraan justise chouhan ne kaha ki ek desh ek chunaav aaj ke jamaane or loktantr main jaruri hi nahin balki samvidhan ke mutabik bhi he
 This will not affect the federal structure of the country either
 unka maananaa he ki is gambhir mudde par vyapak bahes kii zarurat he
 Chauhan says that political parties and experts should find a constitutional way to do in such a situation if there is a hung house after the election and if the political parties do not agree to make any one person unanimously as prime minister or chief minister
 yani aisi sanvaidhanik vyavastha ho ki jis tarah sadan spikar kaa chunaav karata he vaise hi sadan ke netaa kaa bhi chunaav kare
 The same leader should be made Prime Minister or Chief Minister
 lekin bada sawaal yah he ki agar sadan spikar kii tarah netaa chunane ko raji naa hon to kya hoga
 In 'one Nation One Election' this is the screw
 He says that there is one more screw
 agar loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha main madhyavadhi chunaav kii naubat aa jaae to kya hoga
 In such a situation, even if there is a midterm pole if needed, then the rest is for the remaining period
 chouhan kaa kahana he ki aisi vyavastha kai deshon main lagu bhi he
 If a motion of no confidence is brought against the government, be constructive
 yani sansad yaa sadan ye intjaam kare ki sakaaratmak avishvaas prastaav aae
 So that it is decided that if the House does not trust the current Prime Minister or Chief Minister, then who will be the next person whom the House trusts
 ye faisla bhi lage haathon hi hona jaruri he
 Justice Chauhan says that the biggest obstacle in implementing this is coming from Schedule 10 of the Constitution
 yah raajnneetik dalon ko vip jari karne kaa adhikaar detaa he
 It is through the whip that political parties issue orders to their mlas or mps that they must compulsorily appear in the House to vote and also who to vote for
 lekin sadan main pradhanmantri yaa mukhyamantri kaa chunaav ho to phir vip kaa koi matlab nahin rah jayega
 The constitution review committee was formed in 2002 and said that the issue of one country one election is very old
 2002 main constitution rivyuu cameti banaai gai thi
 It also included Justice Venkatachalaiah, Subhash Kashyap and k Parasharan
 usamen bhi ek desh ek chunaav ke samarthan main sifarish kii gai thi, lekin tab bhi 10veen anusuchee kaa maamla uthaa tha
 Apart from this, during the discussions, the need for amendment of Article 85 of the Indian Constitution was also emphasized
 kyonki yahi anuchhed vidhansabha or loksabhaa ke kaarykaal tay karata he
 According to this article, the tenure will be exactly five years from the first sitting of the lower house
 ab samvidhan main sadan kaa kaarykaal kam karne kaa praavdhaan to sarkaar ke paas he lekin ekstansion dene kaa nahin
 This can be extended up to six months only in an emergency

 Openers Shane Watson and David Warner blasted the Indian bowlers, giving Australia an easy 49-run victory in the Twenty20 World Cup in Group f in the Super Eight stage
 bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne tas jitkar gendbaaji kaa faisla kiya lekin unke gendbaaj austrailian ballebaajon ke tufaan ko nahin roak sake or kangarooon ne paanch wicket par 184 ran kaa score khadaa kiya
 In response, the Indian team faltered and 17
 4 overon main keval 135 ran hi bana saki
 Dhoni added an extra batsman Rohit Sharma in the match in the playing XI in place of Piyush Chawla and the Mumbai batsman played an unbeaten 79-run half-century knock at one end which was not enough to win the team
 unhone 46 gend main chaar chauke or chah chakke jamaaye
 None of the top order batsmen could reach double digits while Harbhajan Singh scored 13 runs with a six in the tail batsmen
 austrailia ke dark nanes ne chaar over main 25 ran dekar or shaan tait ne 3
 Won three wickets for 21 runs in 4 overs

 The Australian innings had 16 sixes, with David Hussey (35 off 22 balls and two sixes) and Brad Haddin (one six) also contributing
 bhartiya gendbaajon main harbhajan hi austrailian cricketron ko rokane main safal rahe kyonki unke chaar over main 15 ran bane or pari kaa unka pehla over madan rahaa
 This spinner kept Watson on hold for a while, although he did not get any wickets
 jadeja ne haalanki unki sari mehnat par pani pherate hue apane do over main 38 ran ganvaaye
 Watson hit three consecutive sixes in the first over of 21-year-old Jadeja, while Warner also hit three sixes in his second over, so that Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not put him on the bowling again
 bhartiya team haalanki watasan or warner ko aasaani se shaat lagaate hue dekhne ke alaava kuch nahin kar saki
 Rather, seeing the skyscraper sixes of these two big hitter batsmen, the Kensington Oval ground also looked small
 donon ne do do baar gend stadium ke baahar stand kii chhaton par bhi pahunchaayi
 However, Watson returning in the 11th over and Warner returning to the pavilion in the 14th over were a relief for India

 Today is the time of Android
 or itane hi bajet main yadi koi mobile lenaa he to yphone ke bajaay andrid hi behatar rahegaa
 Can i get similar features on my smartphone in a budget of Rs 15,000? Why not
 itane bajet main aapke paas ek opshan he 8 Gb Moto G
 Its new Android version will hit the kitkat market by the end of this month

 Its 4

 ' apane badbolepan ke liye mashhoor congress ke varisht netaa or kendriya mantri benny prasad verma ne buudhvaar ko aarope lagaaya ki uttar pradesh ke ayodhya se vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) kii prastaavit 84 kosi yatra par samaajawaadee party sarkaar ke pratibandh main ‘match-phixing’ kii gai he
 Beni's statement comes at a time when the Congress wants to bring all parties together to pass the Food Security Bill and other party leaders are refraining from targeting the SP supporting the UPA from outside
 vihip kii yatra par uthe vivaad ke bare main jab poocha gaya to benny ne muskaraate hue kaha, ‘khaadya suraksha vidheyak lataka hua he
 i am not speaking against Mulayam Singh Yadav
 match phixing hui he
 This is a case of ostentatious wrangling
 ’ haalanki benny ke aaropon ke sawaalon par congress pravaktaa mim afjal ne koi sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 He said, 'I cannot say that match-fixing has taken place
 main kaise kah saktaa hum
 i cannot comment on what Beni Prasad Varma said or did not say
 maine ise nahin suna
 However, Minister of Minority Affairs k Rahman Khan expressed his support for the sp's decision to ban the yatra, saying that the Uttar Pradesh government has taken the right decision
 khan ne kaha, ‘uttar pradesh sarkaar ne sahi nirnay liya he, kyonki is yatra kaa ekmaatr makasad shanti ko baadhit karnaa he jabaki sarkaar ko kanoon vyavastha banaakar rakhni he
 The correct decision has been taken by the Uttar Pradesh government
 ’ congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne bijepi par chunaav jeetne ke liye raajnneeti ko sampradayik rang dene or dhruvikaran kaa prayaas karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said that it was clear on the same day that Amit Shah, a close aide of Narendra Modi, was made the BJP general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs by BJP president Rajnath Singh
 singh ne kaha, ‘isamen nayaa kuch nahin he
 It is not surprising
 kyonki yahi unka agenda he- sampradayikaran, dhruvikaran or chunaav jeetne kaa prayaas
 This is bjp's formula, bjp's strategy from the beginning
 isamen nayaa kya he
 The VHP on Tuesday accused Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav that he has banned the '84-kosi Padayatra' under pressure from his party colleague Azam Khan
 aay kar vibhaag ne kaarobaariyon ko badi raahat di he
 The department has given them more time to file income tax returns
 aay karvibhaag ne bijneces ke liye dedline 15 oktober tak badha di he
 The tax authoritytcbdt said that there was a demand from different stakeholders to increase the deadline
 unki maang ko dekhte hue dedline badhaane kaa faisla liya gaya he
 This is a big relief for companies and partnerships
 kyonki isse unhen apane bikri ke aankade or apratyaksh kar kii dendaree kaa hisaab lagane ke liye samay mil jayega
 However, this 15-day defection is not for him
 jinhen outstnding tex bharna he
 For such payment, you have time till September 30
 agar aap iske baad bhugtan karte hai, to aapako is par tay byaaj bhi chukaana hoga
 Explain that earlier the Income Tax Department had extended the date of filing tax for the salaried people
 aay kar vibhaag ne ise 31 july se badhaakar 31 agast kar diya tha
 This gave time to those people who had surrendered their July 31 deadline
 jin logon ne 31 agast tak bhi itiar nahin bharaa he, to ve abhi bhi bhar sakate hai
 However, now they will also have to pay late fees with it
 ajtak ke mahamanch'agenda ajtak'main congress netaa or madhya pradesh main party kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya ne shirkat kii
 Scindia fiercely attacked the BJP and the central government during this period
 madhya pradesh chunaav ke dauraan bijepi ke abaki baar 200 paar ke naare par hamalaa bolte hue sindhiya ne kaha bijepi ke paanch rajyon main kul 200 vidhayak nahin jeet paae
 This is a mandate
 teen rajyon main mili jeet par bolte hue sindhiya ne kaha ki yah ham logon kaa sanyukt prayaas tha
 This election was not between the Congress and the BJP
 yah chunaav logon or bijepi ke bich tha
 On becoming CM, he said that the party's decision is at the top
 jo kaaryakarta kii jimmedaari hoti he wo hamane kiya
 i am happy that our government has come
 hamane 6 ghante ke andar kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya
 We show what we promise
 siem banane kii mahatvakanksha par unhone kaha ki har insaan kii ichha hoti he
 i have no attachment to the post
 janata kii seva karnaa meri ichha he
 You can do that in any way
 yuva khaastaur se sindhiya ko empi kaa siem nahin banane par unhone kaha ki congress ne mujhe kai jimmedaariyaan di
 When we had a government at the center, i got a ministry
 party ne hamen mauka diya
 We are happy with the decision that the party has taken
 sindhiya ne kaha ki sankalp, sangharsh kya aapako keval pad se mil saktaa he
 It should be in your mind, not your heart
 yah kursi se judi nahin honi chahie
 You can fight the battle of truth by holding the road
 mere pitaaji kehete the ki koshish ho ki raajnneeti aapako nahin badal paae, balki aap raajnneeti ko badalen
 This is what i have tried
 empi main mili jeet par bolte hue congress ke is yauva netaa ne kaha ki ham kisi ko khatm karnaa nahin chaahate
 Democracy has to be kept in India
 meri vichaardhaara he ki ek majboot vipaksh hona chahie
 He said that i congratulate all the mlas who have won this election
 main bijepi ke vidhayakon ko bhi badhai detaa hum
 bjp's slogan in MP was 200 times this time
 paanch rajyon ke nattejey ko dekhen to in rajyon main bijepi ke kul 200 vidhayak bhi nahin jeet paae
 The mandate is clear
 empi main ham kaaphi kareeb antar se jite hai
 There are no 2 opinions in this
 sabko saath milakar janata kii seva karnaa chahie
 Scindia said that there should be differences in democracy, because differences only lead to solutions
 manabhed nahin hona tahie
 There is a difference between Congress and BJP
 ham virdohi hai lekin dushman nahin hai
 Rahul Gandhi goes before PM Modi and holds his hand
 bijepi aisa nahin karti
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi's BJP has a difference of ground
 main vaajapeyi ji kaa sammaan karata hum
 Because he was a good person
 is desh ko ek achche insaan kii jarurat he
 Scindia said that it is the responsibility of the opposition to bring out the weaknesses of the government
 iske alaava samaadhaan dena bhi vipaksh kii jimmedaari hoti he
 No one in the BJP is willing to listen
 rafel ko lekar bhi bijepi par bolaa hamalajyotiraditya sindhiya ne rafel ko lekar bijepi par hamalaa bolaa
 He said that we are ready to debate Rafael
 bijepi jepisi banane se kyon bhaag rahi he
 If their heart is clear, their heart is clear, then make JPC all be clear
 hamaara aarope he ki daal main kuch kaala he
 Where will the loan waiver money come from? Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have forgiven the debt of farmers
 iske paise kahaan se aaenge isapar bolte hue sindhiya ne kaha ki bijepi keval vaada karti he
 We do it
 ham kehete hai jaan jaae vachan naa jaae
 The BJP says that the word will go but does not die
 hamane kaha tha ki har kisaan kaa karj 2 lakh tak 10 din main maaf karenge
 We did it in Chhattisgarh
 jab aatmavishvaas ho to asambhav kaam bhi ho jaataa he
 Farmers of the country who constitute 60% of this country
 kai rajyon ke kisaan dilli main aae pradarshan karne
 No minister of the government wiped his tears
 kya hamaara haq sarkaar ke khajaane par nahin ho saktaa
 While replying on who will be your leader in 2019, he said that the leader of the UPA will elect the parties of the UPA
 isaki adhyaksh sonia gandhi hai
 We do not leave everything to a leader
 ham milakar is par faisla karenge
 Scindia said that the elections held in MP, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh were BJP vs People
 2019 kaa chunaav bhi bijepi banaam log hoga
 Rahul Gandhi has the ability to take the country forward
 meraa maananaa he ki unako aage karke hamen ladanaa chahie, lekin aakhri faisla upie legi
 Responding to the question of why he could not become the president of the Congress other than the Gandhi family, Scindia said that the Congress is the party where elections would take place from the panchayat to the state and nation level
 yahaan kisi ko adhyaksh kaa chunaav ladane se nahin roka jaataa
 i believed that Rahul Gandhi should become the President of the party
 unamem wo kshamta he

 The Duckworth Lewis system once again drowned South Africa's Lutia in a 2003 match against Sri Lanka in Durban
 dakshin africa ko match jeetne ke liye ek ran chaiye tha jabaki lakshya ke galat akalan ke kaaran mark bouchar ne aakhri gend par koi ran nahin banaaya
 The South African team, having learned from past experiences, will not want to break their dream of winning the World Cup by making a mistake this time

 In bowling, pacemen Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn have handled the new ball well but spinners Robin Peterson and Imran Tahir have troubled the opposition batsmen the most
 unhone kramash: 14 or 12 wicket chatkaye hai
 Concern for South Africa is the poor form of captain Smith, who has so far scored only 155 runs

 com / 0xep64sgav — Lalit Kumar Modi (@lalitkmodi) April 29, 2016 Let us know that there was talk of getting some matches in Jaipur earlier
 jaipur main pehla match 8 may ko mumbai indiens or sunrisers hyderabad ke bich khelaa janaa tha
 Whereas on 13 May, the second match was to be played between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab in Jaipur
 jaipur main teesraa match 15 may ko mumbai indiens or dilli dairedevills ke bich khelaa janaa tha
 The match was to be held after almost three years after Jaipur Indians were selected as their home ground by Mumbai Indians
 ab mumbai dwaara vishakhapatnam ko apana home ground chune jane ke baad ek baar phir jaipur maichon se dur ho gaya
 Actually, in May 2014, Lalit Modi was elected the president of RCA despite opposition from the BCCI
 is par bisisiai ne aaarasie ko suspend kar diya tha
 After which RCA ceased to host matches
 dilli dairedevills ipel ke match main guuruuvaar ko sabase kamjor team deccan chargers ke khilaaf utregi to uski nazren number van kaa taj phir se hasil karne par hogi
 After losing by six wickets to Kolkata Knight Riders, Virender Sehwag's team slipped to second place in the points table
 dilli ke 11 maichon main 16 ank hai or plyaaf main uskaa pravesh tay he
 At the same time, the Chargers have already been ruled out of the play-off race with five points from 12 matches
 dilli ke liye agle do mukaable royal chalangers bangalore or chennai super kings se he
 There is no doubt that Delhi's side will be heavy in Thursday's match but will have to avoid complacency
 keker ke khilaaf pehali baar dilli kii team kaaphi kamjor najar ai
 Middle order batsmen failed miserably
 newjiland ke ross tailor farm main nahin he or england ke kevin petersan swadesh laut chuke hai
 The defeat of KKR has served as a bellwether for Sehwag & Co
 tailor ne abhi tak aath maichon main sirf 107 ran banaaye hai
 The team management would like to replace Andre Russell, the all-rounder of the West Indies
 acha tej gendbaaj hone ke saath vah upyogi ballebaaj bhi he
 Delhi have depth in batting and have joined another match-winning team as David Warner
 dilli kii gendbaaji or ballebaaji donon santulit he jabaki chargers vyaktigat pradarshan par nirbhar he
 Australia's Cameron White is charged with batting and South Africa's Dale Steyn is bowled
 deccan chargers kai kareebi mukaable haar gai or guuruuvaar ko bhi unke liye phinishing line tak pahunchnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 On Tuesday, they could not chase 170 against Kings XI Punjab and were able to score 145 runs in 20 overs
 aise main dilli jaisi majboot team kaa saamana karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Captain Kumar Sangakkara will hold the additional responsibility while JP Duminy and Shikhar Dhawan will also be trying to retain form
 deccan kii sabase badi kami yah he ki uske paas match kaa pasa palatney vaale khilaadi nahin he

 Petrol prices in these three months where 6

 At the same time, 4 in diesel prices

 It is seeing a lot of impact in Mumbai and Delhi
 ye donon shahar petrol ke liye sabase zyada keemat chukaane vaale shaharon main shaamil hai
 Not getting the benefit of dynamic pricing: The central government adopted the dynamic pricing method in June
 iske tahat petrol or dijal kii keemten roj tay kii jane lagi hai
 But the dynamic pricing started for the benefit of the common man is now falling on his pocket
 oil ministar dharmendra pradhan ne kaha tha ki roj keemten tay karne kaa phayda aam logon ko milegaa
 He said that the reduction in oil prices in the international market will be immediately accessible to the common citizens
 haalanki aisa hota nahin dikh rahaa
 Petrol-diesel prices have been increasing continuously since July

 indian oil company kii website ke mutabik dilli main 70
 30 rupees and 79 in Mumbai

 Mumbaikars are currently paying the highest price for a liter of petrol
 yahi sthiti dijal ke maamle main bhi he
 One liter diesel 58 in Delhi
 62 rupye to mumbai main yah 62
 26 per liter
 dijal ke maamle main bhi sabhi mahanagaron main se mumbai sabase zyada bhugtan kar rahaa he
 The common man has to wait for the prices to come down

 com What will happen on Sunday? Will JDU decide to break the friendship after the meeting or will there be some other solution? The answer to these questions has already intensified
 dilli main bijepi ke diggaj netaaon ne baithak kii to patna main nitish kumaar ne jediu netaaon ke saath puure maamle par charchaa kii
 Both parties are in conflict over the alliance
 maujuuda halaat dekhakar lagata he ki ab is gathbandhan ke talaak kaa vakt aa gaya he
 The rift between the BJP and JDU is getting deeper and wider
 nitish ke adiyal rukh par ab bijepi ke tevar bhi sakht hote ja rahe hai
 That is why when Nitish Kumar called Bihar Deputy Chief Minister, Sushil Modi did not go to meet him
 udhar, jediu kii baithak ke liye party adhyaksh sharad yadav bhi patna pahunch gaye hai
 It is believed that the divorce is fixed in JDU-BJP because Nitish Kumar has made it clear that the matter will be made only if BJP is not called by declaring Modi as PM candidate
 jabaki bijepi bhi modi ke naam par philhal kisi samjhaute ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 At present, JDU has not fully opened its cards
 party adhyaksh sharad yadav ne bhi saaf kar diya he ki gathbandhan main mushkilen to hai lekin bachaane kii koshishen bhi jari he
 Divorce can happen anytime
 
 
 bijepi or jediu main talaak hone main kuch hi samay shesh rah gaya he
 Every day, every hour, it is clear from the statements made by the leaders of both the parties that soon both will find their way
 haalanki aadhikarik taur par isaki pushti nahin hui he
 On Saturday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar invited BJP leaders to his residence for a meeting, but BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi did not go to meet him
 susheel modi ke saath nandakishor yadav ke bhi nitish se milane jane kii khabar ai thi
 When Sushil Modi refused to meet Nitish, Nandkishore Yadav came out with a statement that the party leaders were upset with Nitish's statements on Narendra Modi and hence they would not meet him
 nandakishor yadav ne kaha ki ek angreji akhbaar ko die intervyuu main nitish kumaar ne jo mudde uthaae hai, us par hamaara rashtriya netritv baat karne main sakasham hoga
 Nandkishore said, 'I or Sushil Modi are not fit to talk about the alliance
 nitish ko hamaare bade netaaon se baat kerani chahie
 On the other hand, Shivanand Tiwari, the leader of Nitish's party JDU, also commented
 tiwari ne kaha ki unhen to bijepi se bahut pehle alag ho janaa chahie tha, ab der ho gai he
 Tiwari said it would have been better if he had parted with the BJP in 2010
 shivanand tiwari jediu ke bade netaa hai or unke bayaan ke myne hai
 Obviously, JDU will soon sign a 'divorce' from the BJP
 haalanki isse pehle khabar ai thi ki nitish kii party ne bijepi se is aashwaasan kii maang kii he ki narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar nahin banaaya jayega
 JDU can remain in NDA with this condition
 par bijepi modi ko lekar koi samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahati
 Nitish's hatred of Modi is not good: CP Thakur, BJP leader CP Thakur said that Nitish Kumar should not hate Narendra Modi so much
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki bijepi netaa susheel modi or nand kishor yadav ko nitish se milane janaa chahie or gathbandhan par baat kerani chahie
 Lalu will save Nitish government According to news received from the Kosutras, Lalu Prasad Yadav will not make any effort to topple Nitish government in Bihar
 lalu yadav kii party ke sutron ne bataaya ki yadi nitish sarkaar ke khilaaf koi avishvaas prastaav laayaa jaataa he to argedy nitish ke khilaaf vot nahin karegi
 It is clear that Lalu Prasad Yadav will save his staunch opponent Nitish Kumar's government or it can be said that he will play his leaf against BJP
 sharad yadav shaayad kuch or chaahate hai!yadi baat karen jediu ke adhyaksh sharad yadav kii, jo endie ke sanyojak bhi hai, to ve shaayad nitish kumaar se sahamat nahin hai
 So far from the responses from his side, it is clear that his attitude is softer than Nitish's
 ve shaayad bijepi ke saath bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 On Saturday, JD (U) President Sharad Yadav said that there are problems in the alliance, which will be attempted to be suggested
 unhone kaha ki unki party ne bijepi ke saamne koi shart nahin rakhi
 The decision on the alliance will take place after the party meeting
 shuukravaar ko unhone kaha tha ki bijepi ko pradhanmantri pad ke sambandh main unhone koi ultimatum nahin diya he
 Even before this, he has expressed his soft attitude towards BJP many times
 ve kah chuke hai ki jediu ke netaaon kii baithak hogi or usamen is masale par charchaa hogi
 Only then will the stand of his party be cleaned
 lekin nitish kumaar or jediu ke anya to man bana hi chuke hai ki ab saath nahin nibhegaa or alag ho janaa hi behatar he
