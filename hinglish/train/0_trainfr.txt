 Voices of discontent are beginning to emerge among the leaders

 The special thing is that Umesh Agarwal, who is supporting the ticket of Rao Inderjit's daughter, has got stuck

 Gurugram MLA Umesh Aggarwal warned the party about ticket distribution

 Gurgaon, Rewari, Kosli, Panipat city, Palwal, Fatehabad, Adampur, Naraingarh, Gannaur, Meham, Tosham and Kharkhauda seats have not been declared due to mutual rares

 Two ministers' tickets in the first list: In the first list of 78 candidates for the Haryana Assembly elections, two cabinet ministers of Manohar Lal Khattar's BJP government have been ticketed
 ye mantri hai vipul goyal or raav narbir singh
 The reason for not being named in the list is believed to be internal strife
 raav narbir singh (58) badshahpur se vidhayak hai, jabaki goyal (47) faridabad se vidhayak hai
 Sources reveal that the ticket of Goel, Minister of Industry and Commerce, was cut due to coldness with Union Minister and MP from Faridabad, Krishnapal Gurjar, while Public Works Minister Narbir Singh's leaf was due to the displeasure of Union Minister and Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh

 Vinay Katiyar, the party's national vice-president, who was present at a press conference in Delhi to induct Kushwaha into the party, however, bluntly said that no explanation should be given on the issue
 party netritv ne hamase jo kaha wo hamane kiya
 We are not nervous about what people or media think in this regard
 katiyaar ne ye bhi kaha ki party chunaav main isliye haari ki vah ‘‘ramvaad’’ se bhatak gayi thi
 Another former state president of the party, Om Prakash Singh, said that the day Kushwaha was announced to be included in the party in Delhi, he was also in Delhi and consulted in this regard at the house of National President Nitin Gadkari

 Although there is still time in the assembly elections in Bihar, the political mercury has started climbing
 jahaan ek ore loksabhaa chunaav main mili baari jansamarthan se bhaajapa or jadyu utsahit he vahiin duusari ore pichley teen maheene se bihar kii raajnneeti se gaayab chal rahe argedy netaa tejasvi yadav phir se sakriy ho gaye he
 On Tuesday, the Mahagathbandhan meeting was held at 10, Circular Road, the official residence of former Chief Minister Rabri Devi, in which Congress President, State President Madan Mohan Jha, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party leader Upendra Kushwaha, Hindustani Awam Morcha national president Jeetan Ram Manjhi, developing Insan Party leader Mukesh Sahni joined
 iske baad se ye sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya tejasvi agle saal vidhansabha chunaav main bhi mahagathbandhan ke netaa honge
 Regarding this, all the parties of the Grand Alliance say that this question has no meaning right now, it will be discussed later
 bataate chalem ki 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ko mahagathbandhan ke sabhi dalon ne apana netaa mana tha or unheen kii aguwai main loksabhaa chunaav bhi ladaa gaya
 Will Tejashwi Yadav become the leader of the grand alliance in next year's Bihar assembly elections as well
 mahagathbandhan main shaamil raajnneetik dal tejasvi ko agle mukhyamantri ke taur par project karenge 
 Confusion has now arisen in the Grand Alliance
 hindustani awam morcha ke rashtriya adhyaksh or purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne is baithak ke baad kaha ki tejasvi yadav mahagathbandhan ko netaa mana jaae yaa nahin yah sawaal abhi nahin he
 Manjhi said that the issue will be discussed later and if the need arises, the name of who will be the chief minister's candidate from the Grand Alliance will be announced at the time of elections
 haalanki, argedy ne pehle hi ghoshnaa kar di he ki 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke liye tejasvi yadav hi unke mukhyamantri ke ummidavaar honge
 "" When the custom of organizing Congress Foundation Day was being observed at the party headquarters last year, then Sonia Gandhi suddenly called Sevdal chief Mahendra Joshi
 unhone kuch kaaryakartaaon kii ore sanket karte hue kaha, ve log bas apane hont hilaa rahe hai, unhen vande maataram yaad nahin he
 Shocked by this, Joshi promised that they would do something for it at the next training camp of Sevadal
 bhul gaye sthapana kaa maksadalekin yah maamla raashtragit ke shabdon tak hi simit nahin he
 An influential faction of the party's leading organization Sevadal seems to have forgotten the purpose of its establishment
 bhartiya yuvak congress, mahila congress, bhartiya rashtriya chaatr sanghathan (enesuai) or bhartiya rashtriya shramik union congress (intak) ke saath-saath ise bhi mukhya party ke liye netaa taiyaar karne vaale sanghathanon ke rup main janaa jaataa rahaa he
 But for a long time, these organizations have become merely showy offices
 isiilie yuva sanghathan ko punerjeevit karne main rahul gandhi ko do saal kaa samay lag gaya
 In September 2007, when the successor of the Gandhi family took over as party general secretary, at that time the youth Congress was a bunch of hapless, directionless and youth-crossed members
 sanjay gandhi ke netritv main anek andolanon kii aguai karne vaale is sanghathan kii vah jindadilii bhari urja hulladabaji or jod-tod ke kaamon main barabaad kii ja rahi thi
 Three years ago, Youth Congress President Ashok Tanwar admitted with dismay that the image of manipulators and bargains eclipsed the organization
 lekin aaj vahi tanvar phir sakriy dikhaai dete hai
 He says, "when we used to take a decision earlier, we could hardly implement it
 hamaare upar hameshaa koi-na-koi bada netaa use badalane ke liye dabaav daalata tha
 But now this is not the case
 ''hameshaa ahm rahaa he chhatrachhaaya kaa savaalcongress main is baat kaa hameshaa mahatv rahaa he ki vyakti yaa sanghathan kiski chhatrachhaaya main he
 What is the matter when he is the heir of the main family
 tanvar ek aise congressi netaa ke bete kii misaal dete hai jo party ke khilaaf kaam kar rahaa tha
 In this case, the state Congress president called and said, "we cannot take any action against the father because he is a great leader, but what are you doing in the case of his son?" Yes, "we fired that leader
" pehle agar ham aisa karte to hamaare paas is faisle ko waapas lene keliye phone aa jaataa
 But now such phones do not come
 ''sevadal kii parvaah kisi ko nahinsthiti yah he ki na to yuva uttaradhikari or na koi bada netaa sevadal kii parvaah karata he
 The organization was founded in 1923 to help the families of freedom fighters sent to prison
 baad main iskaa congress main vilay ho gaya
 "our job is to prepare a team of workers for the main party," says Joshi, the chief organizer
 '' 50 varshiya joshi bahut se kaam karnaa chaahate hai lekin zyada uplabdhiyaan hasil karne ke liye unke paas gandhi naam kii haisiyat nahin he
 It was over five years ago when Seva Dal chief Sonia Gandhi attended the organization's training camp in Jaipur
 unhone sanghathan kii dincharya kii badi dilchaspee se teen dinon tak nigaraanee kii thi, jo subah chaar baje shaareerik abhyaas ke saath shuru hoti thi or uske baad jhandottolan ke saath vyaayaam or baad main vande maataram va raashtragan kii jaankaree dene vaali kakshaon ke saath aage badhati he
 But this situation is very different from the instruction of Rajiv Gandhi when he made physical exercise mandatory in the Sevadal camps for Congress leaders under the age of fifty years
 mantriparishad main gine-chune naamaaz mantriparishad main shaamil mukul vaasanic, harish ravat, virbhadra singh jaise kuch mutthi bhar log hi sevadal se jude rahe hai
 This organization is now limited to members who show off at party functions
 jawaharlal nehru ne aresas ke javaabi sanghathan ke rup main sevadal kii kalpana kii thi
 Its cadres were expected to assist in the distressed areas
 lekin prachaar paane main hameshaa aresas sevadal se kahin aage rahaa he
 Joshi is taking a defensive stance, saying, "RSS is ahead only in getting photographed
" khaaki nikar ke kaaran uske sadasyon kii pahchaan aasaani se ho jaati he
 The dilemma of wearing a hat also identifies activists with their special Gandhi cap, but these caps are worn only on special occasions
 sevadal kepurv pramukh prahlaad yadav ko shikaayat rahati thi ki jaise hi koi kaaryakarta yah topi pahentaa tha, koi bada netaa use begaar ke kaam karne ke liye bhej detaa tha
 Anyway, the Seva Dal is going through an identity crisis
 ise yuvak congress kii tarah apane aapako samay ke saath badalane kii jarurat he
 Joshi also advocates getting the younger generation together
 lekin congress ke ghise-pite sidghant kealawa ve unke liye kuch nayaa pesh nahin kar pate hai
 You can compare this with the Youth Congress, whose advertisements have a picture of Rahul and whose membership is crowded
 joshi kaise uske mukaable main aa sakate hai? ve raahat kaaryon ke dauraan yuvakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye nae fishan kii safed oonchi cap or jacket pahanane kaa suzav dete hai
 One of the Seva Dal activists used to say in a joking manner, "gandhiji also needed Munnabhai for campaigning
 ''mahila sadasyon kii chunautiyaan kam nahinmahila congress ke liye chunauti or bhi mushkil he
 Mates of men's organizations consider it a bargain for reservation of women in various committees
 kuch kaa yahaan tak kahana he ki mahila congress ko ab bhang kar dena chahie kyonki aarakshan ke falswaroop party main mahilaon kii numaaindgi pakki ho gai he
 At present, only one in nine general secretaries, and 5 out of 40 secretaries are women
 mahila congress kaa daftar mukhyalay ke ek kone main kuchhek kamaron main simit he, jahaan kadak sooti paridhaan main lipati, parafum kii gandh bikherti praudh mahilaayein apane sanghathan ko kiti club kehane waalon par gusse se baras padati hai or andolanon kii ek sajaavati suchi pesh kar detii hai
 Advising on social work, the president of the organization Prabha Thakur says, "soniaji has told me that the Women's Congress should be engaged in social work apart from political responsibilities
 '' ve centre sarkaar ke karyaalayon main mahilaon ke liye aarakshan kii maang ko lekar pradhanmantri or sonia se shishtmandal ke saath mil bhi chuki hai
 The rest of his list of Kamdhams is also related to women's issues, including the problems of the female class
 jane-pahachaane muddon ko chhod den to is sanghathan kii apni pahchaan ab bhi baaki he
 It is far from the dream of Indira Gandhi that she wanted to see as an organization to compete with the Durga Vahini of the Sangh
 jab ve apane bandhe-bandhaae soch se baahar nikalati hai to sonia par ek ishtahaar nikaal leti hai
 "this kind of thinking is not right," says Thakur
 mahila congress andolanon main kadi mehnat karti he
 We can approach women directly in the kitchen, which men cannot

 aaj zyada loktantric or dimagi taur par zyada soch-vichaar kesath kaam karne vaale taur-tareeke kii jarurat he
 Agarrahul has started work for change from youth organizations, but other leading organizations of the party also need improvement
 sevadal keek mahasachiv kaa kuch talkh andaaj main kahana tha, ''hamen ateet ke dianasoron ko bhang kar dena chahie
 "this is true in the case of INTUC which works more like a travel agent to attend international seminars instead of trade unions
" congress main anya baton kii tarah hi parivartan kii shuruyaat bhi upar se hi kerani hogi, anyathaa in sanghathanon kaa gumnami main kho janaa avashyambhavi he

 uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main khud ko alag-thalag padataa dekh rashtriya lok dal ke adhyaksh ajit singh ne ek baar phir gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ke sanket die hai
 This time, this signal has been given to SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav
 aane vaale chunaav kaa hawala dete hue ajit ne shanivaar ko ek chitthee jari kar apil kii he ki choudhary charan singh or lohia ke anuyaayiyon ko ek manch par aana chahie
 Nitish's rule is praised Ajit Singh wants to go with the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh
 saath hi is gathbandhan main jediu ko bhi shaamil karana chaahate hai
 In this letter, Ajit wrote praising Bihar Chief Ministers Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav that Nitish's governance in Bihar is the governance of Chaudhary Saheb's dreams
 sabhi partiyon se ek hone kii apiljo mahagathbandhan bihar chunaav main nahin ban paaya use ab upi chunaav ke pehle ajit singh or mulaayam singh bananaa chaahate hai
 That is why in this letter, there has been an appeal to be one of Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav
 is chitthee ke jariye gathbandhan ke liye mahail banane kii koshish ho rahi he taaki bikhri partiyaan ek manch par aa saken
 This letter in favor of the Shivpal Yadav alliance also points to the growing position of Amar Singh and Shivpal Yadav in the Samajwadi Party, as these two leaders have been in favor of an alliance with Ajit Singh for a long time and Shivpal was open to this alliance
 Has been advocating ab jabakishivpal yadavaparty ke pradesh adhyaksh auqamar sinharashtriya mahasachiv ban gaye hai to aise main is chitthee ko samaajawaadee ke ichha se bhi jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 At present, the Samajwadi has not responded to this letter, but it is believed that soon the parties will move towards an alliance which can take the form of a grand alliance before the elections
 nitish ko manaanaa nahin asanbihar chunaav ke ain pehle mulaayam singh kaa mahagathbandhan se pallaa jhaad lenaa samaajawaadee party ko gahare ghaav de gaya tha
 Nitish Kumar then openly criticized Mulayam Singh
 haal hi main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bhi apni kisaan yatra main mulaayam singh par bijepi ke khilaaf maukey par khadey na ho paane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 In such a situation, it is a difficult thing for the Samajwadi Party to form a grand alliance before the Uttar Pradesh elections, but Ajit Singh's letter is being seen with the same eye that perhaps the initiative of the grand alliance on his initiative may be back on track
 bihar main ain maukey par chot khaae nitish kumaar ko manaanaa aasaan bhi nahin hoga, wo bhi tab jab nitish kumaar kii jediu-congress se kareebi he or chunaavon ke pehle wo congress se gathbandhan ke mood main he
 The initiative to prepare the land of the Grand Alliance has been the support base of Ajit Singh in western Uttar Pradesh and the Samajwadi Party is currently looking weak there
 aise main dono partiyaan gathbandhan ke liye utsuk hai lekin pahal koun kare ise lekar jo sanshay tha wo ajit singh kii chitthee ke saath hi khatm ho gaya
 Now, there is an attempt to prepare the ground for the grand alliance, which will be interesting to see how much support it gets

 Retirement is one of the important stages of life and we all have to go through it
 ritair hone ke baad aapaki kamai ruk jaati he lekin sabhi moolbhoot kharche jas ke tas bane rahete hai
 The savings you are making today will not be able to meet your needs after retirement, so along with retirement, you need a hefty amount that can make your life comfortable
 ritair hone se pehle ek moti rakam sunishchit karne ke liye jaruri he ki aap badi saavdhaanee ke saath surakshit nivesh karen jo samay aane par aapke kaam aa sake
 For this, you need to know the investment options available in the market and compare them and invest according to your needs
 1
 Equity - Investments in the stock market are not considered appropriate for retirement plans
 haalanki iske jariye naukari ke shuruyaat main aap apane nivesh ko oochaal dene kaa kaam kar sakate hai
 2
 insurance- yah ritairement plan ke liye prayog hone vaala ek uchit madhyam he, lekin jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki yah madhyam aapaki risk security ke liye zyada kargar he na ki nivesh main adhik laabh ke liye
 3
 provident or sarkari fund– ritairement plan ke liye yah sabase uchit madhyam hai kyonki isamen jokhim bazaar main uplabdh anya madhyamon kii apeksha sabase kam rahata he
 4
 phicsad diposit- lambii avadhi main kisi bank kafixd dipogitek surakshit or vishwasaneey madhyam rahata he
 However, in terms of retirement policy, this medium has the effect of inflation and in the end your actual return decreases
 5
 Mutual Funds - These options are often suggested
 isamen peshewaron kaa anubhav or visheshgyata saath main milti he
 Hence, either you invest by paying consultancy charges for investing in it, otherwise detailed information of this medium is necessary for investing in yourself
 6
 Property - is a fully encouraged asset for a long period
 khaskar real astate main oochaal ke baad
 But not everyone has money to invest in it
 7
 Pension plans are ideal for retirement as they provide support to your portfolio of loan schemes and diversify your portfolio
 iske saath hi isamen ek lakh tak nivesh karne se aapako apane vaarshik kar main chhot bhi milti he

 is kadam ko donon deshon ke sambandhon main ai giravat main sudhaar laane ke prayaas ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 According to the language, the Indian Navy said that its ship Sumedha has been deployed from May 9 to 17 to jointly monitor the EEZ of Maldives
 nausena ne kaha ki yah maldive ke vishaal EEZ kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye bharat sarkaar or bhartiya nausena kaa prayaas he
 The Navy said the deployment was done as its 'mission-based deployment'
 maldive ek chota-sa desh sahi, lekin vastav main bharat ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Know ten reasons why we cannot remain mute spectators on the situation in Maldives
 
 
 1
 The Maldives is strategically located in an important place in the Indian Ocean
 yah hamaare desh ke lakshadweep samooh se mahaj 700 kimi
 is far
 maldive ek aise mahatvapurn jahaaj maarg se sata hua he jisase hokar china, japan or bharat jaise kai deshon ko urja kii aapurti hoti he
 About 97 percent of India's international trade is through the Indian Ocean
 isliye yah samajha ja saktaa he ki iske margon ko surakshit karnaa bharat ke liye kitna mahatvapurn he
 2
 hind mahaasaagar ilaake main 40 se zyada desh or duniya kii kareeb 40 fisadi aabaadi he
 China began sending its ships to the Gulf of Aden in the Indian Ocean ten years ago in the name of anti-piracy operations
 isaki vajah se maldive kaa mahatv lagaataar badhata gaya or ab yah antarrashtriya bhu-raajnneeti kaa centre ban gaya he
 3
 bharat ab dakshin asia main ek mahatvapurn takat ban gaya he
 India has an important role in maintaining security in the Indian Ocean region
 iske liye bharat ko suraksha or pratiraksha ke kshetra main maldive ke saath sahyog kaayam karnaa hoga
 4
 china kaa maldive ke saath badhata aarthik sahyog bharat ke liye chintaa kii baat he
 China accounts for about 70 per cent of the Maldives' external debt
 iske pehle dashakon tak maldive ke bharat ke saath kareebi rishte rahe hai
 The Chinese Embassy opened there only in 2011
 bharat iske kaaphi pehle 1972 main hi vahaan apana duutavas khol chukaa tha
 So now India will have to take some steps to reduce this domination of China
 maujuuda raajnneetik sankat iske liye ek mauka he
 5
 bharat or maldive kaa dashakon purana dharmik, saanskrithik, saamaajik or kaarobaari rishta he
 India is among the first countries to be recognized after Maldives gained independence in 1965
 isliye maldive hamaare liye mahatvapurn he
 6
 maldive main kareeb 25,000 bhartiya rahete hai, jo doosraa sabase bada videshi samudaay he
 About 6 percent of the tourists visiting Maldives every year are from India
 vahaan khaskar bollywood celebraties chhuttiyaan manaanaa pasand karte hai
 Many Bollywood films have also been shot there
 7
 a large number of citizens from Maldives to India also come for education, treatment and business
 bharat main ucch shiksha yaa upachaar ke liye long turm vija hasil karne vaale maldive ke nagarikon kii sankhya dinodin bad rahi he
 8
 maldive kii jansankhya kaa bada hissaa yah chahta he ki is sankat ke daur main bharat madad kare
 Among them are opposition parties such as former President Nasheed's party MDP and their supporters
 9
 Maldives is a member country of SAARC
 saarc main bharat kii bhoomika ek agua raashtra kii tarah he
 If this continues, then there are chances of moving out of SAARC ahead of Maldives
 isliye bharat ke liye yah jaruri he ki use kisi tarah saarc main banaaya rakhaa jaae
 Maldives is the only country in SAARC where PM Modi has not visited
 10 
 Maldives is a Sunni Muslim majority country
 maujuuda raashtrapati yamin ne desh main dharmik kattarta ko badhaava diya he
 It is believed that a large number of youth from Maldives have gone to Syria and joined ISIS
 kamjor maldive dharmik ativaadiyon or kattarpathiyon kii panaahagaah ban saktaa he
 Apart from this, smuggling and drug trade can also increase there
 yah sab bharat kii chintaa badhaane vaali baaten hai
 We already have a religious fundamentalist country like Pakistan, we cannot afford another Islamic fundamentalist country in the neighborhood, this has to be curbed

 TAPM stuck in political controversy was also opposed by many Congress leaders
 film ke content par jamkar vivaad hua
 The matter reached the court court
 anupam kher ne purv piem manmohan singh kaa role nibhaayaa
 The casting of Anupam and the rest of the actors also became a matter of discussion
 lekin in sabhi vivaadon or charchaaon kaa movie ke box offis collection ko phayda nahin mila
 Despite the TAPM aggressive promotion, the ticket window is proving to be a flop
 11 janvari ko relies hui film kii kamai ke aankade chaunkaate hai
 Anupam Kher's movie made just 13 in the Indian market in 4 days
 90 karod kaa bijness kiya he
 There is a decline in the collection of TAPM
 film ke liye box offis par tikna badi chunauti ban gaya he
 Trend pundits are also surprised by tapm's dismal earnings

 # 1
 Political content is based on the book of Sanjay Baru, political advisor to TAPM Manmohan Singh
 pehle se ye saaf tha ki film kaa content political he
 Viewers not interested in politics rejected TAPM outright
 film manmohan singh ke kaarykaal or gandhi parivaar kii raajnneeti par phoxd he
 TAPM disappointed movie lovers who were looking for entertainment in theaters
 critics ne bhi film ko zyada acha rispons nahin diya he
 View this post on instagramin the last few days, from all over the world, i have got some very humbling and emotional messages for my work in # theaccidentalprimeminister

 It does not have the current spices of typical Hindi films
 gane, dance, kamedi or ection factor movie se gaayab hai
 The film did not attract the interest of the film serving the serious political drama
 # 3
 There is no big star in the film other than Anupam Kher and Akshaye Khanna
 donon hi actors kaa staradam aisa nahin he jo cinemagharon main logon kii baari bheed ko juta paae
 The absence of any major a lister actor was negative for TAPM

 He is shown the hero

 The demand for feature phones has also increased
 The growing demand for feature phones can also be gauged from the fact that Chinese company Transssion Group, which entered India last year, is growing rapidly in the Indian market due to its Itel brand of feature phones

 Through King Voice, the feature phone will read the message by itself and will tell you what is written in it

 In the case of cyber security, hacking, viruses, ransomware and privacy, feature phones are a much better option than smartphones
 china kii is company ne apane feechar phone main fast charging kii suvidha bhi di he jisase jaldi phone charge ho saktaa he

 a PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court demanding CBI to investigate the matter
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki kochi team ko lekar mantri ne apane prabhaav kaa upyog kiya he jo ki sahi nahin he
 Also, it has been asked through PIL that what is the source of Sunanda's income through which so much money was given
 shashi tharur ne twitor par safai di he ki lalit modi chaahate the ki kochi team na bane
 Tharoor has written that he does not know all the partners of the Kochi team but knows Sunanda well
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki sunanda shashi tharur kii hone vaali patni he

 dilli hai court ne supreme court ke chif justise ke khilaaf yon utpeedan ke aaropon se jude maamle main media reporting par bain lagane ke liye lagaai gai yachika ko khaarij kar diya he
 The Delhi High Court rejected the petition saying that because this case is under the supervision of the Supreme Court first, there is no need for the High Court to interfere in the matter
 hai court ke chif justise rajendra menon ne yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki is maamle main hai court ko hastkshep karne kii gunjaaish hi nahin he
 The petition, filed by an institution called the Anti Corruption Council of India, demanded that the allegations leveled against the Chief Justice of India belonged to a woman who was a former Supreme Court employee and was dropped due to some serious allegations
 aisi mahila ke jhuthe aaropon ke aadhaar par chif justise of india ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh ke tahat aisa kiya ja rahaa he
 If the media continues to report on the matter related to it, it will not be a better situation for the Indian judiciary
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki is maamle se jude cese kii reporting media main tab tak naa ho jab tak kii supreme court kii taraf se gathit kii gai cameti apni jaanch puri naa kar le
 And only if the truth is found in the allegations, the media should be allowed to report the matter
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki media report bina gaharaai main jaae bina jin chizon ko report kar rahi he, jiskaa phayda kathith 'peedita' ko mil saktaa he
 While it is not clear now whether the allegations made by the woman are true or a conspiracy to defame the Chief Justice of India
 yachika main is baat kaa bhi andeshaa jaahir kiya gaya he ki sijeai par lagaae gaye aaropon main deshadrohi takaton kaa haath ho saktaa he
 And those people can try to take advantage of it , whose case is in the Supreme Court and whose cases are being heard by the Chief Justice of India
 aisa justise gogoi par dabaav banane ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki vah kai mahatvapurn maamalon kii sunwaayee kar rahe hai
 The petition specifically states that the kind of allegations made may also threaten the functioning of the independent judiciary

 K
 hangal ko main us samay se jaanati hum jab maine abhinay ke kshetra main kadam rakhaa tha
 But i got to know him more closely when i worked with him in 1980 in the drama Hori based on Munshi Premchand's novel Godan through IPTA (indian People's Theater Association)
 ve hori bane the or main unki patni dhaniya
 At that time i came to know how devoted they are to their work
 ve reharsal ke dauraan hi apane role ko analise kar lete the or puure samay usee ko ji rahe hote the
 He never considered Hori as a character, becoming Hori himself
 hamane lagaataar chah sho kiye the or agle manchan kii baari kareeb dedh maah baad ai thi
 So after gathering, we all started rehearsals to further recreate our character
 tabhi ve mere paas aae or mere kirdaar ke bare main mujhe nirdesh dene lage jabaki pichley chah sho main main usee kirdaar ko unke saath nibhaa chuki thi
 We were engaged in a debate for a long time on that issue and when our attention was broken, we found that both of us were left there, the rest were gone
 duusare log bhi unke kaam karne ke andaaj ko samaj chuke the, isliye unke saath bahes main utarane kii bajaae chupchaap alag hat jate
 Sometimes i would feel that they ask too much questions, but later i knew that that was their biggest specialty, due to which they would forget themselves completely and get into the personality of the characters in the stories
 ve peshawar main paley-bade the or vibhaajan ke baad mumbai chale aae the
 He was a tailor but started acting as a teenager
 unhone mumbai main bhi acting jari rakhi
 He made his film debut at the age of 50
 unki pehali film 1966 main ai basu bhattacharya kii teesri kasam thi
 He did more than 200 films and often played the role of an elder like father, uncle or Rahim uncle of Sholay
 unki anya charchit filmon main shaukeen, bawarchi, abhimaan or namakharaam shaamil hai
 He felt more comfortable speaking in Urdu than in any other language
 ve apni puri script urdu main likh lete or baad main usee ke hisaab se kaam karte
 Once i had to see something to see if it was correct, i asked for a copy of the script
 unhone kaha ki main usamen likhi ibaarat nahin samaj paaungi
 Then he told, "I know Urdu well and when i read it written in this way, i can remember my lines better
 "unke bare main sabase dilachasp baat yah thi ki ve hameshaa behtareen poshaak pahante or chust-durust dikhte
 They cut their clothes with the same quality they used to act
 bade afsos kii baat he ki mujhe unke saath sirf ek baar kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 At the time when i was going to Mumbai, he was more busy in theater, so i could not see much of his work related to theater
 mere pati jayadev unhen ipta ke dinon se hi jaanate the or party yaa anya maukon par akasar hamaari mulaakaat ho jaaya karti thi
 He was an excellent person
 maine yah bhi suna he ki ve apni aadhi aamadani theatre kii tarakkee ke liye diya karte the
 Staging plays for IPTA is commercially difficult as it is not a profit-making organization and its dedication to it was its biggest contribution
 unhen kirdaar kii lambaai se koi fark nahin padataa tha
 He himself would immediately be ready to become that character and say, "if we don't think about him, who else would think?" ke
 Hangal is a major contributor to Serious Theater

 The family put everything at stake There were many occasions when Harminder and Harmanpreet reached the ground, the boys abused each other
 lekin harminder ke dimag or dil main ek junun tha un galiyon ko kis tareeke se taaliyon main badalawaaya jaae
 This was probably not as easy for Harminder Singh
 jab harman ne 115 ball par 171 ran banaae, to puraa desh unki vaahvahee kar rahaa he
 But it is also true that in this journey a family had put everything at stake

 haryana kii golden girl or yuva shooter ke twit ne haryana main sardi ke mausam main raajnneetik maahaul ko garma diya he
 Manu Bhakar, a 16-year-old youth player from Jhajjar district, has tweeted that the government had announced to give Rs 2 crore for winning the Youth Olympics, whether it was a jumla or whether it would be given to him
 iske baad haryana ke khel mantri anil vij ne manu bhaakar ko naseehat bharaa ek twit kiya or kaha ki vah anushaasan main rahakar apane khel par dhyaan den
 Their amount will be given to them
 gauratlab he ki youth olympix main gold jeetne par khel mantri anil vij ne bhi twitor par hi manu bhaakar ko 2 karod rupye inaam dene kaa elaan kiya tha jo ki abhi tak manu bhaakar ko mila nahin he
 It has come to the fore that the sports department of Haryana cannot give two crore rupees to the Youth Olympic winner because the provision is only to give one crore
 vah baat alag he kii manu bhaakar ko abhi 1 karod rupee bhi nahin mila he, lekin haryana ke khel mantri kii anushaasan main rahane kii naseehat jarur mili he
 Sir Please confirm if it is correct
 
 
 Or just Jumla

 com / atxplkbsyv — Manu Bhaker (@realmanubhaker) January 4, 2019 Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has also targeted the tweets of Manu Bhaker and Anil Vij
 hooda ne kaha ki haryana ke khilaadi desh or duniya main apane naam kaa loha manavaa chuke hai, isamen koi shaq nahin he
 But there have been many times in the past years that they have seen players upset and shocked
 darasal, yah dishaheen sarkaar he or khilaadiyon ko uchit maan-sammaan nahin de paa rahi he
 It is worth noting that at one time Manu Bhaker was not given the license of gun by the Haryana government before going to international competitions, and when the news came on Aaj Tak, the Haryana government gave license to Manu Bhakar after that
 ab inaam kii raashi par manu bhaakar ke twit ke baad ek baar phir se raajnneeti garma gai he

 bhartiya pratispardhaa ayog (sisiai) ne indiabulls houseing finance kii kareeb 93 saal puraane lakshmi vilaas bank ke saath prastaavit vilay ko manjuuri de di he
 Indiabulls Housing Finance informed the stock market, "the Competition Commission of India has considered and approved the merger proposal in its meeting held on 20 June 2019
 "haalanki abhi vilay kii prakriya puri karne ke liye arabiai, sebi samet anya sansthaaon kii manjuuri jaruri he
 This process can take from 6 to 8 months
 bataa den ki april 2019 main lakshmi vilaas bank ne indiabulls houseing finance ke saath vilay kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The board of directors of Lakshmi Vilas Bank has also approved the proposal
 indiabulls houseing or lakshmi vilaas bank ke vilay prastaav ke tahat bank ke shairdharakon ko prati 100 share ke badale indiabulls ke 14 share milenge

 Presently Laxmi Vilas Bank has 569 branches, 1046 atms across the country
 vahiin agar indiabulls houseing finance kii baat karen to deshbhar main 220 shakhaaen hai
 Let us tell you that in the year 1926 Lakshmi Vilas Bank came into existence
 iske vajood main aane ke baad rigerv bank of india (arabiai) se 1958 main license mila
 After this Lakshmi Vilas Bank became Commercial Bank
 saal 1974 se bank ke branch kaa vistaar shuru hua
 Lakshmi Vilas Bank's branch and financial centers are present in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala as well as Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata
 haal ke daur main raajnneeti puri tarah vyakti puja kii giraft main he
 The same is happening not only in India, but also in America, Russia, China, Turkey, Japan and Brazil
 yah 24x7 tivi or soshal media kii gahari paith, or saath hi rajnatik or saamaajik mulyon main nihit aakhyaanon ke patan kaa parinaam he
 It is almost as if people everywhere in the world have given some miraculous powers to charismatic leaders in the hope of 'good days'
 chamatkaari kadam aksar aatmghaatee siddh hue, jaise november 2016 kii (ku)khyath notebandi, jise vafaadaar media ne kaledhan ke khilaaf pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa brahmastra bataaya tha
 But in such an environment, where the furious media has tried to fill our minds with the idea of presenting the truth of the squid, Modi can make India win the Cricket World Cup, for him, presenting an adventure or hypocrisy as a miracle
 How difficult will it be to break public opinion! In such circumstances, it can be expected that the situation for the disappointing defeat of Congress in the recent general election Some individuals rather than issues will be held responsible
 rahul gandhi par chaundhiya dene vaale flash kii jad main he
 Those who are asking for the Congress to be ashamed or die or who blame Rahul completely for this defeat, forget that the Congress under Rahul's leadership recently gave the BJP water in Gujarat Had given and formed governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 istipha dene ke bajaae, rahul ko congress ko punerjeevit karne or haar ke vaastavik kaarnon ko samaj kar unhen dur karne par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie tha
 But if Rahul had chosen this path, perhaps the old Congress leaders would not have come out of the mentality like 'chalta hai chalte do'
 rahul gandhi kaa istipha, rajnatik varg ke liye ek chetavanee he ki use hameshaa janata kii raay ke prati javabdeh hona chahie, or congress party ke kshatrapon ke liye kadaa sandesh ki ek badi vaicharik ladaai ab ladi jaani chahie
 The BJP has emerged as an unprecedented threat to the existence of the Congress
 or yah tab hua he jab bhaajapa ke khate main apane pehle kaarykaal main koi vaastavik uplabdhi nahin he
 He did not work too hard for his election manifesto
 congress ne, modi sarkaar ke khilaaf ek joardaar abhiyaan chalaaya or rajkaaj ke apane nazariye ko pesh karne main kaaphi samay, prayaas or urja lagaai
 Then what went wrong for the Congress and what went in favor of the BJP? Answer can be found in the notion of 'nationalism'
 bhaajapa ne media main apane hamadardon kii madad se khud ko gauravanvit or taqatvar bharat ke nirmaan ke sapane ko samarpit party kii tarah pesh kiya jabaki congress ko is sapane ke prati udasin party ke rup main safaltaapurvak pesh kiya, bhale hi virdohi ke rup main nahin
 The Congress put forward one of its views on governance, but failed to reclaim the democratic, nationalist identity about which it claims historically and logically
 ateet ke saath ek bhaavnaatmak judaav or bhavishya ke liye chintaa sabhi samaajon main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 This patriotic spirit can be expressed as a backward, fanatic, extremist nationalism or as a democratic, inclusive and forward-thinking nationalism
 rashtrawaad ke vibhinn pahaluon par academik bahes chal sakati he, lekin rosemara kii raajnneeti main, rashtriya bhaavana kii rajnatik takat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Visionary leaders of the Indian independence movement like Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and Maulana Azad knew this
 yah congress hi thi jisane sarvapratham deshbhakti kii bhaavana or aupniveshik rashtrawaad ke khilaaf manobhaav ko ek samaveshi rashtrawaad main parivartit kiya tha
 Freedom fighter and social reformer Dada Dharmadhikari had the contours of nationalism expressed in the form of 'humanitarian Indianness', aspiring to represent all sections of Indian society, and that its success had limitations
 vastav main, gandhi ke is jang main kudane ke baad, congress bhagwaan shiv kii baraat kii tarah ho gai, jisamen vividh prakaar ke paatr, kai baar to joardaar virodhabhasi bhi, ek saath aae
 The idea of inclusive India became the bride of this procession - Lord Shiva of the procession
 bahut hi samaveshi rashtrawaad kaa vichaar swatantra bharat ke samvidhan main shaamil tha
 The rise of dissent in the nation and their expression, conflicting interests of different groups, were historically inevitable; The question that was, and still is today - how to address these bouts and democratic aspirations? How should the horizon of Indian nationalism be expanded? The Congress has tried to find an answer in the last decade on how to accommodate the new and outspoken processions that have participated in Shivji's procession, but in a way that has become detrimental to it
 isane apane manch kaa civil socity ke aise kaaryakartaaon dwaara istemaal kii ijaajat de di jo bhartiya samaajwaad ke susangat vichaar ke bina vibhinn ekasutri-muddon or agendon ko aage badhaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In an eagerness to accommodate various cultural-identity discourses, the Congress abandoned its legitimate claim of progressive Indian nationalism in such a way that the RSS and the BJP were left open to infect society with the idea of its brand of right-wing majorityism
 apane istife main, rahul gandhi ne apane sahyogiyon ke ravaiye ke prati yah kehete hue gahari niraashaa vyakt kii ki aresas ke khilaaf ladaai main, ''kai baar, main khud ko puri tarah se akelaa paata tha
 "now compare this statement with what he said at the beginning of Modi's first term, when he described the BJP government with a first-absolute majority at the Center as the fruit of the" difficult austerity of five generations "of the RSS cadre
 aresas kaaryakartaaon main ek sankalp, jo bhale hi galat or aspasht ho, kaa bhav bharkar use itnaa prerit kiya jaataa he ki vah us sankalp ko swayan ke mukaable bada maanata he
 Unlike the RSS and its political unit BJP, the Congress has never been a cadre-based party
 usne upniveshwaad virdohi swatantraaa sangram ke dauraan ek party kii tulana main ek andolan ke rup main kaary karne ko praathamikta di
 Even after independence, Nehru did r
 ke
 In an interview to Karanjia (the then editor of the magazine Blitz) discussing the 'dangers' of turning a Congress-like movement into a cadre-based system, it was called "conflicts, counter-conflicts and wastage of the nation's vitality"
 ' Told
 (da mind of mi
 Nehru, London, 1960, p
 58)haalanki, nehru kii congress ne kabhi bhi samaveshi, loktantric, durandeshi bhartiya rashtrawaad ke apane vaicharik aadhaar ko nahin khoyaa
 He continued to train his cadres and educate the public at large about his idea of india, even without formal arrangements for cadre training such as communist parties
 francisi vichaarak andre melluks ke yaadgaar shabdon main, nehru ne gandhi or swatantraaa andolan ke anya diggajon ke saath kaam karne se praapt anubhavjanya gyaan or doordarshee drushtikon ke saath prabhavi rup se 'raashtra ke guru' kii bhoomika nibhaai
 Remarkably, he dealt with both Hindu and Muslim communalism not with secularism, as is commonly understood because of its misinterpretation, but with nationalism
 dharmanirpekshata ko to nehru ke bhartiya rashtrawaad ke vichaar ke andar pravesh karaayaa gaya tha, or yah nishchit rup se bhartiya samskruti kii vibhinn kashmakashon se anbhigya yaa uske prati udasin nahin tha
 It is also important that despite not being a cadre-based party, till recently the grassroots political activist was never ignored in the Congress
 itihaas kaa yah sabak aaj congress ke liye 'kya karnaa chahie or kya nahin' ko rekhaankit karata he
 It is also important to take advantage of the services of professionals and technocrats, but infinitely more important than that is to place these services in the political concept
 duusare shabdon main, niyamit rajnatik kaaryakarta kii antardrushti or drushtikon ko uchit sammaan or vajan dena behad mahatvapurn he
 Likewise, it is good to be sensitive to the aspirations of different social groups and identities, but it is more beneficial to accept them all in a national perspective and challenge to be aligned with national aspirations
 yah tabhi ho saktaa he jab kaaryakartaaon ke vaicharik prashikshan or janata ko rajnatik rup se jaagruk karne ko gambhirtha se liya jaae or haar ho yaa jeet ho, us lakshya se peeche na hataa jaae
 There should be no illusion that we are standing in the middle of a cultural war between the intense competition of India's past, present and future ideas
 congress apane astitv ke saamne khadi is chunauti kaa safaltaapurvak saamana tabhi kar sakati he, jab vah ek samaveshi or pragatisheel rashtriya drushtikon ko apnaane, use parishkrut karne or aakraamak samvaad sthapit karne ke liye taiyaar ho sake

 The Mathura police made a tremendous blockade for three hours to nab Narayan Sai
 vrundavan ke ashramon main chaape maare gaye, lekin scorpiyo or sai kaa kahin pataa nahin chalaa
 Narayan Sai, along with his two other companions, appeared to the police in a white Scorpio on the Khandauli (agra) toll plaza of Yamuna Expressway at around 8 am on Saturday morning

 The Mathura police were alerted on this

 After nearly three hours of action, the police got disappointed
 iske baad police ko khabar mili ki paanch lakh kaa inami narayan sai raaya cat se vrundavan main pravesh kar gandhi maarg sthit ek ashram main aakar chhip gaya he
 The Kotwali police raided it in several ashrams, but even after two hours of investigation, his hands remained empty

 This is the disadvantage of having a strong regional party
 ye partiyaan do telegu rajyon main apane dam par sarkaar main hai
 Many parties, including DMK, AIADMK, TRS, TDP, YSRC, JD (S), are likely to have these two national parties
 There is going to be a historic election for
 loksabhaa chunaav ke saath-saath 234 siton vaali vidhansabha kii 18 siton ke liye ho rahe up-chunaavon ke nattejey, teen saal puraani annadramuk sarkaar kaa bhavishya tay kar sakate hai
 In the last Lok Sabha, the AIADMK had won 37 out of 39 seats in the state and emerged as the largest party in the state
 ab annadramuk or dramuk, donon ke hi kaddavar netaa kramshah je
 Jayalalithaa and M

 Both parties have at their convenience aligned with other regional parties and national parties - DMK with Congress and AIADMK with Bharatiya Janata Party
 nateeja yah rahaa ki donon hi mukhya dravid partiyaan ab keval 20 siton par chunaav lard rahi hai or rashtriya dal in dravid partiyon ke vot bank kaa phayda uthaaenge
 This time the electoral equations appear complicated
 saal 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav akele ladgaye vaali annadramuk is baar bhaajapa, pattali makkal kaachi (piemke) or desiy murupoku dravid kadgam (dmdike) ke saath chunavi samar main utari he

 Out of the 18 seats where the by-elections are being held, 16 seats are vacant within the AIADMK due to disqualification of Dinakaran's supporters
 lekin teen anya siton par upachunaav ko abhi sthagit rakhe jane ke kaaran vidhansabha main sadasyon kii maujuuda prabhavi sankhya 213 he
 The AIADMK currently has 114 mlas and will have to win at least two out of these 18 seats to reach more than half of its total strength of 116, to retain its government

 In these elections, both BJP and Congress can be more profitable than in 2014
 bhaajapa ne 2014 main sirf ek loksabhaa seat jiti thi jabaki congress khaataa bhi nahin khol pai thi
 The BJP is contesting in a meager number of seats compared to its alliance partners
 vah rajya kii 39 main se sirf paanch siton par chunaav lard rahi he jabaki annadramuk 20 siton par or piemke 7 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 In 2014, BJP contested against AIADMK in alliance with PMK
 is baar bhaajapa ne tamilnadu se apane saansadon kii sankhya badhaane kii aas main annadramuk ko bhi saath liya he
 The aiadmk's performance in social sector schemes has not deteriorated
 haalanki anya kai mudde hai jo party kii sambhaavnaaon par prabhaav daal sakate hai
 These include the implementation of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test or NEET in the Medical Entrance Examination, police firing on the Sterlite Copper Factory protesters in Thoothukudi last year, in which 12 people were killed, demanding a halt to projects such as tapping of methane in the Cauvery Delta And the proposed Neutrino Observatory Project which involves building a 1,300 meter deep cave under a hill in Theni district
 Get
 dramuk ne apane ghoshnaa patr main kaha he ki vah methane or nutrino pariyojnaon ko band karegi
 The DMK will try to fight so vigorously on these issues that the assembly elections due in 2021 have to be held well ahead of time

 Stalin has tried to woo the state's minority and Dalit votes by announcing his support for Congress President Rahul Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate
 dramuk ranneetikaron kaa kahana he ki rajya sarkaar ke karmchaariyon main bhi annadramuk sarkaar ko lekar gaharaa asantosh he
 This means that the state's second-largest vote bank, after the minority and Dalit votes, can be mobilized in favor of the DMK and they are hoping to further increase the party's strength

 dilli main pradooshan ke lagaataar badhate str ko dekhte hue rajya sarkaar kii taraf se yah faisla liya gaya he
 However, the reason why BS-6 is being implemented
 usamen yah zyada badlaav nahin kar paaegaa, lekin yah aapaki jeb par baari jarur pad saktaa he
 Decision taken due to increasing pollution Pollution in Delhi has increased considerably since November 7 last month
 pradooshan ke isi badhate str ko dekhte hue hi rajya sarkaar ne bies-6 eendhan ko do saal pehle hi yuj karne kaa faisla kiya he
 Under BS-6 fuel, the amount of sulfur in petrol and diesel is limited to one tenth of a million (PPM)
 haalanki bies-6 gaadiyaan 2020 se hi aaengi
 What is BS-6 Bharat Stage Emission Standards (BS-6) is also known as Bharat Stage (BS)

 It was two years ago
 may 2012 main petrol kii keemat dijal ke mukaable 79 fisadi (dilli main 32 ru
 ) Was more
 aaj yah faasla sirf 16 fisadi rah gaya he
 The price of petrol has reduced compared to two years ago, while the price of diesel has increased by at least 24 percent
 16 sitambar ko dijal par se sabsidi ghataane kii vajah se ab iskaa khudara vyapaar phaayde kaa sauda ban gaya he
 This is the first time in the last 12 years
 1973 main pehle vaishvik tel sankat ke baad bharat main prashasnic mulya nirdhaaran pranali kii shuruyaat hui thi, tab se dijal kii keemten sarkari niyantran main thim
 Interestingly, nobody noticed that the Ganga is flowing upside down and the burden on the poor has increased while the rich are getting benefited
 aam taur par daawa to yahi kiya jaataa he
 However the facts are to the contrary
 sawaal yah bhi he ki itnaa bada sudhaar itani khamoshi se kaise hua?dijal sabsidi main katautee karnaa 1991 ke baad se sabase mushkil or sabase khamoshi se hone vaala sudhaar he
 In the beginning of 2011-2012, income from taxes was decreasing but the burden of expenditure and subsidy was increasing
 is vajah se rajkoshiya ghaataa teji se badaae laga
 The current account deficit was also increasing due to the import of gold, rising prices of crude oil, increased import of coal for power plants
 aise main reating agenciyon ne 2012 ke madhya main bharat kii reating ko pehle to nakaaratmak kiya or phir ise or ghataakar ‘‘jokhimaura yaa anishchit’’ karne kii chetavanee di
 As a result, taking loans from abroad became even more expensive
 petrol or dijal kii keemton main baari antar ne automobile bazaar ko nuksaan pahunchaaya
 The fuel of the SUV became cheaper than the fuel of the scooter
 petrol kaaron ke kharidaar ghat gaye or dijal kaaron ke liye kharidaaron kii lambii kataren lagane lageen
 To deal with these situations, the government had only a few measures, one of which was to reduce the subsidy on oil
 yah sudhaar pehle kii kai sarkarein laana to chaahati thim lekin janvari 2013 main yah kadam upie sarkaar ne uthaaya
 Nevertheless, the government could not afford to increase the fixed but modest increase (50 paise) in diesel prices every month
 virodh shuru ho chuke the or mahangaai par iskaa asar bhi chintaa paidaa karne vaala tha
 The Lok Sabha elections were close, so the government withdrew the move
 sudhaar aage badaye jaaenge yaa nahin, is bare main faisla endie sarkaar ko karnaa tha
 The government took steps towards reform
 kachche tel kii keemat main kami or rupye ke majboot hone se sabsidi kam karne main aasaani hui
 We can expect that now the price of diesel will vary according to the global prices
 bharat main eendhan kaa bazaar mulya dijal ke aayaat or niryaat keemton ke ausat se tay hota he
 Like petrol, it is still far-fetched to fully handover diesel prices to the market and the government also wants to move very cautiously in this direction as crude oil prices are not stable
 aglaa kadam hoga petrol or dijal kii keemton main santulan laana
 For this, major changes will have to be made in the tax system
 philhal petrol ke upabhokta dijal ke mukaable lagbhag 10 ru
 The government pays subsidy on cooking gas and kerosene on the basis of additional taxes paid
 shuruyaat acchhee he or hamen is kadam kaa swaagat karnaa chahie
 But there is still a long way to go
 car yaa anya vaahan par laal yaa pili batti lagaana har kisi kaa sapana hota he, lekin kanuunan har koi iskaa istemaal nahin kar paata
 At the same time, many people illegally place red or yellow lights on their vehicles for flogging or status symbol on others

 Aamir felt so bad that he refused to release Dangal in Pakistan
 aamir ne ye jaanate hue bhi ki isse vahaan dangal kii jamkar piresi hogi, unhone jataayaa ki unke liye desh kaa sammaan sabase pehle he
 It is worth mentioning that Aamir Khan had said in a program last year that his BB Kiran reads daily in newspapers and tells him that now he should leave this country and go elsewhere
 haalanki is coment par bavaal hone ke baad aamir ne saaf kaha tha ki wo desh se bahut pyaar karte hai or yahaan se kahin nahin ja rahe hai

 Women using the latest anticonvulsant pills on the market may have twice the risk of becoming a blood clot compared to women who already use antenatal pills
 vaigyanikon ne pehle hi chetavanee di he ki munh ke jariye lee jane vaali sabhi tarah kigarbhanirodhak goliyanthekka banane kaa khatra dhire dhire badhaati hai jisase pair yaa haath kii gahari shira main thrombosis tathaa pulmonary embolism ho saktaa he
 Pulmonary embolism disrupts the blood supply to the lungs and this condition can sometimes be dangerous
 khabar ke anusaar, ek america adhyayan main daawa kiya gaya he ki projestosen hormone ke istemaal se banaai gai garbhanirodhak goliyon ke seven se khun kaa thakka jamane kaa khatra doguna ho jaataa he
 This study has been done by researchers at Boston University School of Medicine
 garbhanirodhak goliyaan bazaar main 50 saalon se bik rahi hai
 Now their third generation is also available in the market
 garbhanirodhak vigyapanomen unke puri tarah surakshit hone kii baat kahi jaati he, lekin aisa nahin he
 The main difference between the pills available in the market is the hormone and its quantity
 mukhyataur par garbhanirodhak goliyon ke vishay main dharna he ki inamen do alag alag hormone hote hai
 One estrogen and the other Gestagen
 estrogen main kuch khaas said iffect hote hai
 Which can increase blood pressure
 yah sharir main khun ke bahaav ko parivartit kar saktaa he jisase sirdard or ulti kii shikaayat ho sakati he
 This can also cause women to feel heavy tension in the chest
 hormone kii adhik maatra vaali goliyaan or adhik samasyaayein paidaa karti hai
 While low-hormone pills, there is a risk of irregular erosion
 haalanki, yah asuvidhajanak jarur he, par doctoron kaa maananaa he ki isse haani apekshaakrit na ke baraabar hoti he
 The hormonal pills of the Gestajan group may also cause menstrual periods to have irregular mental effects
 saath hi issetvachaa ke rang par bhi asarpadata he
 Initially, women feel that they have no problem
 lekin baad main goli ke prabhaav se unka mood bigadaa sa rahata he
 Whereas the third generation of contraceptive mini pills contain only progestogen class hormones
 isse mahilaon ko sirdard aurastanon main dard kii shikayatato nahin hoti, lekin ye goliyaan kabhi kabhi jaanaleva bhi ho sakati hai
 This increases the risk of blood clots from women who do not take any contraceptive pills
 taaja shodh garbhanirodhak goliyon kaa niyamit seven karne vaali 1 lakh se adhikmahilaon par aadhaaritahai
 Of these, an average of 30 women who eat new contraceptive pills are prone to blood clotting, while the number of women dependent on old contraceptive pills is 12
 5 fisadi darj kii gai he
 According to doctors, women should not eat contraceptive pills containing levonorgestrel

 sutron ne kaha ki yah antar or kam ho saktaa he, jo congress party main chintaa kaa sabab bana hua he
 Encouraged by his performance despite the defeat in 2014, Irani has been visiting Amethi continuously since then and has been working hard to capture this prestigious seat where many still regard him as an 'outsider'
 congress emmlisi deepak singh ne kaha, "amethi gandhi parivaar ke liye doosraa ghar jaisaa he
 We will ensure a big margin of victory for Rahulji

 Prior to this ban ordinance, the government was upset that the products under ENDS did not fall within the definition of drugs as per the law of the country

 buudhvaar ko jalandhar main unki shaadi hui
 The entire family of the boy came to Jalandhar from Bharatpur
 vivaah to sakushal sampann ho gaya or buudhvaar kii raat hi dulhan ko bhi vidaa kar diya gaya, lekin sasuraal jate hue raste main hidulhan ko lebar penshuru ho gaya
 Around 1 on Wednesday night
 0 baje sasuraal waalon ne dulhan ko raajpura se aage sarkari aspataal main daakhil karavaaya, jahaan guuruuvaar kii subah kareeb 4

 Because we are going to impose heavy tariffs on China
 lekin iskaa bahut hi saral samaadhaan he jisase na sirf tex se bachaa ja saktaa he balki, tex incentive bhi mil saktaa he

 Make your products in the United States instead of China
 Start building new plants now

 Not only this, India will be the main reason for increasing oil consumption in the next two decades
 abhi aisa mana jaataa he ki pashchim asia ke tel utpaadak desh bharat-china ko oonchi keemat par tel de rahe hai
 Rising oil prices have added to this sentiment

 ) chhattisgarh congress main casting couch jaisi ghatana ko lekar bavaal much gaya he
 State Congress in-charge PL Punia has said that Rahul Gandhi has constituted a committee in this matter and soon the whole matter will be investigated
 chhattisgarh kii pradesh NSU pratinidhi ne apane rashtriya adhyaksh firoz khan par yon shoshan ke liye dabaav banane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He complained in writing to the AICC
 chhattisgarh main vidhaan sabha chunaav ke pehle party ke bheetar yon shoshan kii ghatana saamne aane ke baad congress pasopesh main he
 The party's state in-charge PL Punia met with the workers throughout the day at the headquarters of the Chhattisgarh Congress in Raipur, but during this meeting he also held a meeting with the officials of the NSUI and the State Congress Committee in a closed room
 iskaa khaas makasad yon shoshan ke aaropon kii satyata kii jaanch karnaa tha
 As the matter is related to the Chhattisgarh Congress, he, as the state in-charge, looked into the facts of allegations of sexual exploitation of the young leader
 unhone silsilewar NSUI kii gatividhiyon ke saath saath uske rashtriya adhyaksh ke bare main kai suchanaaen ikaitha bhi kii
 The basic theme of the closed-door meeting was related to the actions and allegations of the party's important functionaries and the nsui's Chhattisgarh state representatives
 is shikaayat ne party ke bheetar bavaal machaa diya he
 Many women activists of the party have also questioned the functioning of Feroze Khan
 in mahila kaaryakartaaon ne party se maang kii he ki is maamle kii jaanch jald honi chahie
 However, the leader of the NSUI, accused of sexual exploitation, is on a tour of Maharashtra
 shikaayat ke saarvajanik hone ke baad usne media se duuri bana lee he
 The Congress party is also investigating how, when this complaint was lodged within the party forum, how was it leaked to the media
 shikayatakarta mahila netaa or uski bahan ne chhattisgarh ke kisi bhi thane main apane saath hui yon shoshan kii ghatana kii shikaayat darj nahin karai he
 Not only this, he also did not lodge a complaint with the Chhattisgarh Congress State Committee
 apitu, yah shikaayat sidhe AICC or congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke paas kii gai he
 Suddenly after allegations of sexual exploitation within the party, the leaders are not thinking what to answer even in this matter? Party leader and Chhattisgarh in-charge PL Punia has clearly stated that if anyone is found guilty in this case, strict action will be taken against him
 bataaya jaataa he ki kuch maah main hi NSUI ke rashtri adhyaksh firoz khan teen baar chhattisgarh kaa daura kar chuke hai
 During this time, he had also held separate talks with male and female activists of NSUI for quite some time, but now nsui's credentials are also at stake due to such sudden accusations against him
 filhal kaaryakartaaon ko jaanch report kaa intjaar he

 Along with this, he also kept watching the questions from side to side in the room
 ant main kastro patrakaron kaa ek sawaal lene ke liye raji ho gaye
 One of the major differences between these countries, which remained enemies of each other since the era of the Cold War, is the loudness of the media

 isi samvaadadaata sammelan ko cuba televijan par sidhe prasaarit kiya gaya
 Several weeks before this address Cuban and US officials held long talks about whether reporters would be allowed to ask questions after the two leaders met in Havana? When Obama visited Beijing, Chinese President Xi Chinfing also faced questions from reporters
 vahiin america raashtrapati baraak obama ne cuba kii apni aitihaasik yatra ke dauraan donon deshon ke sambandhon main aaj ke din ko ek ‘nayaa din’ qaraar diya
 In an attempt to draw a boundary on previously US interference in Cuba's internal affairs, Obama declared that "the fate of Cuba will not be decided by the United States or any other nation
" ’’ During his meeting with the communist country's President Raul Castro, the US President said that America will stand for democracy, but will focus on the future, not the past
 kastro ne bhi ‘‘donon deshon ke bich bane hue gahare matbhedon ke khatm naa hone kii baat’ maanate hue ‘‘donon deshon ko kareeb laane vaali chizon’’ par kaam karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Cuban president, however, insisted that the US has long imposed economic sanctions and the withdrawal of Guantánamo Cuba to end the long-standing chapter of bitterness between the two countries
 isse pehle obama ek aupchaarik mulaakaat main sirf teesri baar kastro se mili
 He is the first US President to reach Cuba for the first time since 1928

 lekin in matbhedon ke baavjood donon netaaon ne kaha ki ve sheet yuddh ke samay ke sangharsh ko khatm karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Finally, Castro agreed to take a question from the reporters
 shityudh ke daur se ek-duusare ke dushman bane hue in deshon ke bich maujuud bahut se antaron main se ek bada antar media kii mukharata bhi he
 In a joint press conference, 84-year-old Castro asked in response to the question, "what did you say about political prisoners?" Can you repeat the question asked about political prisoners? '' obama or kastro somvaar ko america or cuba ke sambandhon ke ek nae daur main baat kar rahe the, lekin is sanyukt sammelan ke dauraan do samskritiyon, do raajnneetik vyavasthaaon or do pidiyon kaa takaraav kai baar dekhne ko mila

 At the same time, during his historic visit to Cuba, US President Barack Obama described today's day as a 'new day' in the relations between the two countries
 cuba ke aantarik maamalon main purv main kiye jate rahe america hastkshep ko lekar ek seemaa khinchne kii koshish karte hue obama ne ghoshnaa kii ki ‘‘cuba kii kismat kaa faisla america yaa koi doosraa raashtra nahin karegaa
 '' america raashtrapati ne samyavaadee desh ke raashtrapati raul kastro ke saath apni mulaakaat ke dauraan kaha ki america loktantr ke liye khadaa rahegaa, lekin ateet par nahin balki bhavishya par dhyaan degaa
 Castro also announced to work on "things that bring the two countries closer", acknowledging the "deep differences between the two countries are not ending"
 cuba ke raashtrapati ne haalanki jor diya ki donon deshon ke bich lambey samay se bani hui katutaa kaa adhyay samaapt karne ke liye america dwaara lambey samay se lagaae hue aarthik pratibandh evam guantnamo cuba ko waapas karnaa uski sharten hai
 Earlier, Obama met Castro for only the third time in a formal meeting
 vah aise pehle america raashtrapati hai jo 1928 ke baad pehali baar cuba pahunche hai
 The comments pales of revolution main sena ke ek band ne obama kaa swaagat kiya
 This building is the main building of the government since the 1959 revolution
 is kranti ne cuba ko ek samyavaadee desh bana diya tha
 Faced with pressure to show positive results to end the bitter standoff between the two countries in the US for more than half a century, Obama then sat down for discussion with Castro against the backdrop of the two countries' flags
 america ne ab tak cuba ke khilaaf lagaae gaye aarthik pratibandh puri tarah nahin hataae hai or cuba main ab bhi kai buniyadi swatantraaaon par roak lagi hui he
 But despite these differences, the two leaders said they were ready to end the Cold War conflict
