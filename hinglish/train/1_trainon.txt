 com / soqeomergs— Cricket World Cup (@cricketworldcup)july 20, 2017 In 'budha Hoga Tera Baap', Amitabh Bachchan is a gangster named Viju who has left Mumbai's crime life and settled in Paris
 viju ko jabanj police afasar karan yani sonu sood ko maarane kii supaari di jaati he jo gangsters kaa safaya karne main laga he
 Viju has only one problem
 koi buddha bol de to dimag satak jaataa he lekin viju kya sachmuch karan ko maar degaa
 There is a twist in the story here that we will not grind your fun by telling you
 'buddha hoga tera baap' diarector puri jagannatha ne banaai he jo south kii superhit film pokiri bana chuke hai
 Salman Khan's film Wanted was remade Pokiri
 isiilie 'buddha hoga tera baap' kii editing, villen, film ke twist and turn main wonted kii jhalak saaf dikhti he
 Wearing fancy sunglasses and fashionable clothes, Harbha Davidson plays the heroic old man riding a bike, Amitabh Bachchan with such energy that this old man does not look fake while beating a lot of goons
 ye buddha naujavaanon ko romance ke tips detaa he lekin chhedchhad par unki pitayee bhi lagaataa he
 Big b also adds a huge amount to his item number where he dances with many girls to his old hit songs
 haalanki ye recorded gane sunne main original jaise achche nahin lagate lekin dekhne main mazedaar hai
 Many clever dialogues were written to match Amitabh's angry youngman personality which will make you laugh
 afsos ki ravina tandon par filmaaya gaya item number gaayab he
 Scenes like Baghban were made with Amitabh and Hema Malini where the film seems loose
 big bi ko chhodkar baaki karactors bahut majbootee se develop nahin hue yahaan tak ki villen bhi nahi
 The stronger the villain, the more strong the hero looks, but the biggest feature of the film is its entertainment value
 yahaan ection he, imoshan, drama or kamedi bhi he
 My rating for 'budha Hoga Tera Baap' is 3 stars
 bhartiya cricket team ke mastamaula khilaadi hardik pandya kisi na kisi baat ke chalate surkhiyon main bane rahete hai
 These days he is in the headlines due to one of his videos
 video main hardik apane bhai krunal pandya ke saath milakar dhanush kaa gaanaa Why this Kolaveri Di ga rahe hai

 The song lyrics have no special meaning
 kaha jaataa he ki dhanush ne is gane ko mahaj 10 minute main likhaa tha
 Aishwarya told Dhanush that she wanted a light song that tells the story of a broken heart in love
 gane ko aniruddh ne compoj kiya tha or yah unka debyue song tha

 cricket world cap ke liye team india ke 30 sambhavit khilaadiyon kaa chayan kar diya gaya
 Contrary to the expectations of cricket fans, Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan did not figure in this list
 har kisi ke man main ek hi sawaal he ki aakhirkaar in senior khilaadiyon se saath aisa kyon hua
 We tell you the reason
 
 
 1
 The first measure of being selected in a team is performance
 pichley do saalon main sahvaag ne 13 vanade match khele hai jisamen unka ausat 20
 Stayed 23
 vahiin, gambhir ne 30 vanade mukaable main 23
 Scored at an average of 58
 kisi bhi openar ke liye ye ausat behad hi saadhaaran hai
 In the Vijay Hazare tournament, both players played a total of 6 matches, in which both scored 1-1 half-centuries
 isi toornament main harbhajan singh ne punjab kii captaini kii or 6 maichon main sirf 7 wicket jhatak paae
 Yuvraj Singh too did not do much with the bat, 168 runs in five matches
 jahir to isi saal may main khele gaye ipel main aakhri baar maidan par utre the
 Stuck in the fitness trap, Mumbai's Ranji team was also not found
 2
 This time the World Cup will be played on the grounds of australia-new Zealand
 newjiland to nahin par australia ke cricket maidan duniya kii anya maidan kii tulana main zyada bade hai
 Statistics show that double and triple play is more than boundary on these grounds
 yani kshetrarakshan khel kaa ek ahm pahalu banakar ubharta he
 In such a situation, the age and fitness of these five players came in the way of their selection
 sahvaag, gambhir, jahir or harbhajan yuvaaon kii tulana main kam furtile hai
 There is no question on Yuvraj's fielding, but illness has slowed him down as well
 aise main dhoni khel ke is ahm paksh ko najar andaaj nahin kar sakate
 The truth is that they had no other choice
 3
 Cricket is one of the few sports in which the role of a captain is important
 chaahe vah maidan par faisla lene kii baat ho yaa phir team kaa chayan
 It was only after the 2011–12 tour of Australia that Dhoni made it clear in gestures that the future team was not a place for senior players in India
 dhoni kii is chahat ko board kaa samarthan bhi mila, dhire-dhire senior khilaadi sanyas lete gaye or yuva khilaadi team kaa hissaa banate gaye
 The Indian team has become used to playing without these players in the last two-three years
 hamanen inke bina hi isisi champions trophy jeeta
 Maintained the winning rhythm in the home series
 sanket saaf the, iske baavjood in paanch khilaadiyon ke team main jagah banane kii ummid karnaa bemaani sa lagata he
 4
 agar prashansakon kaa dil rakhane ke liye cricket board in paanch khilaadiyon ko 30 sambhavit khilaadiyon main shaamil bhi kar letaa to aage kya
 Put your hand on your heart and ask if these players would have been able to make it to the last 15
 jawaab aap jaanate hai, bilkul nahin
 In such a situation why should not the youth be given a chance
 aakhirkaar bhavishya to vahi hai or unhen is vakt protsaahit nahin kiya gaya to shaayad kahin der naa ho jaae
 The only mantra for success today
 
 
 Catch Them Young
 Be it the corporate world or the cricket field
 jisane yuvaaon par bharosa dikhaaya, safalataa use hi mili
 5
 badlaav kaa daur aisa hi hota he
 Now take your house
 jaise-jaise aap bade hote jate hai, aapke faislon ko ghar ke varisht sadasyon ko bhi maananaa padataa he
 Team India is also going through this phase
 ek vakt in khilaadiyon kaa daur tha, inhone hi hamen world champion banaaya
 His coin used to speak, but now the circumstances are different
 board ne bhi maan liya he ki ab yuva chehron par hi sara daaromadar he
 The World Cup is not the last tournament of cricket, but the game will continue even after that
 in daleelon ke jariye ham ye nahin bataanaa chaahate ki aaj ke yuva khilaadi viru, gambhir, yuvi, bhajji or jahir se behatar hai
 The reality is that had it not been for this, we would hardly have become world champions in 2011
 record bhi is baat kaa samarthan karte hai
 In the last World Cup, these players made a total of 40
 38 kii ausat se 1171 ran banaae the jisamen do centuri shaamil hai
 These players took a total of 14 catches and took 45 wickets
 par itihaas kii madhur yaadon ke liye bhavishya qurbaan nahin kar sakate
 There is a shocking news from Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan ek ek ladki ne ek do saal kii maasoom bacchee ko sirf isliye jinda jala diya ki bacchee kii maa ne yuvati par chori kaa iljaam lagaaya tha
 While the girl died in the hospital during treatment, the five-year-old innocent girl has become an eyewitness to this incident
 police ne aaropee yuvati sahit do logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di he
 The incident is from Bhojpur village in Thanhwan area
 bataaya jaataa he ki yahaan ke ahimran singh kii do varshiya beti diksha 23 july ko ghar ke nikat chote bacchon ke saath khel rahi thi
 During this time there was no big presence in the house
 aise main mauka paakar usee samay gaanv kii rahane vaali 20 varshiya yuvati baby urf style baaltee main ek gilaas mitti kaa tel lekar ahimran singh ke ghar pahunch gai
 On seeing it, he poured the earthen oil on the initiation and then handed over the innocent Koag
 ghatana ke baad hangaamaa hua to aanan-fanan mengambhir rup se ghayalbacchee ko jila aspataal le jaaya gaya, lekin doctoron ne use mini pijiai saifai refer kar diya
 The innocent diksha, who is swinging between life and death, died during treatment, while a friend of his five years has become the witness of the incident
 khasbaat yah he ki chashmadid bani bacchee shabnam aaropee yuvati ke parivaar kii hi he
 The woman was accused of theft, it is said that there was a sense of revenge behind this incident
 asal main kuch samay pehle diksha kii maa anita ne aaropee yuvati par kundal chura lene kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 According to Anita, Shelly stole the coil and pledged it to a goldsmith for Rs 6000
 maamle kaa khulassahone baad panchayat baithi
 6000 rupees were returned to the girl in the panchayat, after which the style was looking for revenge
 haalanki, iske liye vah is had tak gir jaaegi, iskaa andaja kisi ko nahin tha
 SP of Mainpuri Udayashankar Jaiswal said, 'this is a very inhumane incident

 The Congress remained in a state of unease
 sutron ke anusaar ukt tathyon ke aadhaar par rajyapal ne maharashtra ke rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne raashtrapati shashan lagane ke liye sifarish kii thi
 It was approved by the Union Cabinet
 baad main raashtrapati ne bhi hari jhandi de di or maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan lag gaya
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena has reached Supreme Court against this recommendation of the Governor
 shivasena kaa kahana he ki rajyapal ye sab bijepi ke ishaare par kiya
 The Shiv Sena says the governor gave the party only 24 hours
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri ke videsh daure se pehle hui cabinet baithak main maharashtra ke mudde par charchaa hui or rajyapal kii sifarish ko maan liya gaya
 The Shiv Sena has challenged the Supreme Court's decision to recommend imposition of President's rule in Maharashtra by the Governor
 shivasena ne kaha he ki usne NCP or congress se samarthan patr hasil karne ke liye teen din kaa samay maanga tha, lekin rajyapal ne khaarij kar diya
 The Shiv Sena says the governor gave 48 hours to the BJP to tell if it could form the government, but gave the Shiv Sena only 24 hours to get a letter of support
 shivasena ne aarope lagaaya ki rajyapal ne sarkaar banane ke avasar se inkaar karne ke liye bijepi ke ishaare par jaldbaaji main kaam kiya
 The Shiv Sena has said in the petition that the governor has acted in this matter in a fast forward manner
 rajyapal kaa shivasena ko vakt na dene kaa 11 november kaa faisla ansavaidhanik, manamaana, avaidh or samanta ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 Shiv Sena has urged the Supreme Court to issue directions to give it a reasonable time to form the government

 Whenever there is talk of sports other than cricket in the country, the plight, lack of money, lack of proper functioning of the Federation and Sports Ministry, neglect of players, lack of good facility
 
 
 jaisi baaten sunne main aati hai
 Is it right to put all the blame on the Federation Sports Ministry and the officials? bharat main tennis jaise khel haashie par isliye he ki is ore koi dhyaan nahin de rahaa he yaa isaki or vajah kuch or he
 
 ?kyon he bhartiya tennis main khalipan?bhartiya tennis kaa itihaas behad gauravshaalee rahaa he
 Legendary players like Ramanathan Krishnan, Vijay Amritraj, Ramesh Krishnan, Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi, Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna have made their presence felt
 phir bhi khel premiyon ko bhartiya tennis main ek khalipan-sa lagata he
 Something seems incomplete
 aakhir kyon he yah adhuuraapan? bhartiya tennis main wo mukaam hasil kyon nahin kar sakaa, jisaki ummid kii ja rahi thi
 Leander Paes created a sensation by winning the bronze medal in the singles matches of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics
 aisa lag rahaa maano tennis main ek nae yug kaa aagaaj hua he
 But in 21 years, no Indian tennis player has been able to show his stature in the Olympics so far
 grand slam dubles or mix dubles muqablon main bhartiya khilaadi duusare desh ke khilaadi ke saath jodi banaakar chaaye rahe
 But differences between each other kept playing while playing with each other
 kya yahi vajah he tennis main khalipan kaa
 What is the reason behind the decline of Indian tennis? Despite being a big player, why does Indian tennis appear to be backward
 is mudde par jab ajtak dot in ne olympian or antarrashtriya khilaadi vishnu vardhan se baat kii, to unhone bataaya ki federation or sarkaar kii taraf se khilaadiyon ko koi madad nahin milti
 Players have to travel with their pocket money
 kai baar to coach or fijio ko dene ke liye paise tak nahin hote
 Because of which players fall behind
 kya sach main khel mantralay or ol india tennis federation ne apni ankhe band kii hui hai? jisaki vajah se bhartiya tennis thodaa pichad rahaa he
 Those results are not coming which is expected
 federation or khel mantralay ko dosha dena kitna sahi?ol india tennis par jimmedaari he desh main tennis ke maahaul ko badhaane kii or nae khilaadi taiyaar karne kii
 a Federation official, on the condition of anonymity, said that it is very easy to accuse someone
 federation ne junior, sab junior, neshnal or antarrashtriya str ke toornament ko aayojan jamkar karaayaa he
 Money flowed like water, but these tournaments were never taken positively
 hamesh ye kaha gaya yah to federation kaa kaam he
 He has to do it, the right thing has never been tolerated
 phir sponcers ke na hone se nuksaan bhi uthaanaa padaa
 The players had to bear the brunt and the Federation was blamed
 sava sau karod kii aabaadi main deshbhar main sirf do hajaar yuva hi tennis khelte hai
 The Sports Authority of India and the Ministry of Sports have all the resources to make many tennis players in the country
 sarkaar ke udasin ravaiya bhi tennis main is khalipan kii badi vajah maani ja sakati he
 The clash of star players in Asus has also damaged Indian tennis
 indian tennis esocies kya kiya abtak?ol india tennis federation kii naakaami or uske virodh main kuch purv khilaadiyon ne saal 2013 main indian tennis association banaai
 The aim was to give the right facility to the players and develop tennis in the country
 is association main mahesh bhupati, joideep mukherjee, somdev burman jaise diggaj the
 No one is aware of how much work the association has done at the ground level in the last four years
 aise main khilaadiyon kaa sarkaar or federation par dosha dena samaj se pare he
 Personal selfishness has spoiled the game
 Are the All India Tennis Federation, government and sportspersons guilty of lagging behind Indian tennis
 asal main dekha jaae sahi talmail or nijee swaarth kii vajah se bhartiya tennis aage nahin bad sakaa
 There was no solidarity between the players, the federation, the sports ministry
 jisaki vajah se bhartiya tennis wo mukaam hasil nahin kar sakaa, jahaan use hona chahie tha
 In order to bring any sport up, some basic things need to be understood and run together, only then any sport develops

 The move comes amid international pressure on Pakistan to bridge the gap between good and bad terrorists after the Taliban gunned down 150 people, including 136 students, in a terrorist attack on an army school in Peshawar

 jon kairi (america videsh mantri) samet kisi anya paksh ke dabaav ke chalate nahin
 He said that transactions in bank accounts of banned groups have also been banned and Saeed's foreign visits have been banned
 radio pakistan ne yah jaankaree di he
 Pakistan's decision comes a few days before US President Barack Obama's visit to India to attend the Republic Day celebrations on January 26 as chief guest
 isse pehle ek pakistani adhikari ne kaha ki jeyudi or kai anya samoohon ko bain karne kaa faisla sarkaar ne kai din pehle kiya tha or is faisle ko lagu karne ke taur tareekon kaa faisla karne ke liye grih mantralay ko kaha gaya tha
 The ministry complied with these orders, including Saeed's two groups, JUD and fallah-e-insaniyat Foundation (FIF), putting them on the list of banned organizations for their involvement in extremist and terrorist activities
 exef pakistan sthit lashkar e taiyaba kaa pramukh cheritable sanghathan he jis par america ne pratibandh lagaaya hua he

 India has been repeatedly asking Pakistan to hand Saeed to India for questioning him about his role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks

 The official said that other major groups who have been banned include the Haqqani network, which has played a role in several fierce attacks in Afghanistan
 america lambey samay se hakkaani or jeyudi ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang karata rahaa he
 The assets of all these groups will be sealed after the ban

 In addition, he carried out the US embassy attack in Kabul in 2011, as well as several major truck attacks in Afghanistan
 america or afghanistan ke adhikariyon ne baar baar yah baat kahi he ki pakistani khufia agency iesai afghanistan main apana prabhaav badhaane ke liye gopneey tareeke se hakkaani network ko samarthan detii rahi he
 Pakistan denies the allegation
 america ne sitambar 2012 main is samooh ko aatankwaadi sanghathan kaa darja diya tha
 Pakistan banned JUD in 2002 but the court later lifted the ban due to lack of evidence of the group's involvement in terrorism
 is samooh ko america, europea sangh, bharat or rus ne aatankwaadi sanghathan ke rup main pratibandhit kar rakhaa he

 Chidambaram said on Monday that the conviction of Ajmal Kasab in the Mumbai attacks trial and the acquittal of his two associates show that India is ruled by law and that it is a message to Pakistan not to export terror
 needed
 mumbai kii vishesh adaalat ke faisle par pratikriya karte hue chidambaram ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘adaalat ne kuch aropiyon ko doshi tehraaya he
 He has also acquitted two accused
 yah is baat ko pradarshit karata he ki adaalat apane faislon main swatantra, nidar or eemaandaar he
 He said that this was an open trial which went according to the law and the accused were given full opportunity to defend themselves
 unhone kaha, ‘main is baat se santusht hum ki saal bhar ke bheetar ham sambhavat: ek behad jatil mukademe main badi sankhya main aaropee tehraye gayi logon main se kuch ke khilaaf faisla karne main sakasham rahe
 'home Minister Chidambaram said,' This lawsuit makes it clear that India is a country where rule of law prevails
 ’unhone kaha ki faujadaari se judaa mukadmaa charan dar charan hi chal saktaa he or saal bhar main abhiyojan is mukademe main aropiyon kaa dosha sabit karne main safal rahaa he
 In response to a question about Chidambaram being given a message about Pakistan, he said, "this decision is a message to Pakistan that they should not export terrorism to India
" agar unhone aisa kiya or agar aatankwaadi pakade gayi to ham unhen nyaay ke katghare main laane main kaabil honge or unhen kathor dand diya ja sakegaa
 Expressing happiness over the conviction of Kasab in the trial, Chidambaram congratulated the investigating agencies and the prosecution, based on whose evidence Kasab and his associates were exposed
 chidambaram ne kaha ki gusse or bhaawanaaon ke saath judi maangon ke baavjood sarkaar ne faisla kiya ki kasaab or uske saathiyon par kanoon ke tahat mukadmaa chalaaya jayega or kisi bhi aaropee ko diye jane vaale adhikaar unhen bhi muhaiyaa karaaye jaaenge

 Relieved
 jin karmchaariyon kii 7 saal kii seva puri karne se pehle hi maut ho gai ho, unke parijanon ke liye pension badhaane kaa nirnay liya gaya he
 This revised pension rule will be applicable to government employees including central armed force personnel
 centre sarkaar ne central civil services (pension) rules, 1972 ke niyam sankhya 54 main badlaav kiya he or yah badlaav 1 oktober, 2019 se lagu ho jayega
 According to the changed rule, the family members of employees who have died between the service of less than 7 years will be given 50% of the last salary of the employee in the next 10 years as pension
 pehle niyam yah tha ki saat saal se zyada kii sarvice puri karne vaale karmchaaree kii yadi maut ho jaati he to uske parijan ko to antim selary kaa 50 fisadi hissaa pension ke rup main miltaa tha, lekin saat saal se kam seva vaale karmchaaree kii yadi maut hoti to uske parijan ko karmchaaree kii antim selary kaa 30 fisadi hissaa hi masik pension ke rup main miltaa tha
 The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions said in a statement, 'the government believes that the family of such employees who died in the early stages of their jobs need to be given pension at a higher rate, because in the initial stages Employee salary is low
 ab sanshodhit niyam 54 ke mutabik jin sarkari karmchaariyon kii naukari jwine karne ke saat saal ke bheetar maut ho jaati he, unke parivaar ko bhi badi hui rate, antim vetan ke 50 fisadi tak pension agle 10 saal tak diya jayega
 'it is noteworthy that recently the Modi government has taken several steps in the interest of employees
 sarkaar ne rail karmchaariyon ko 78 dinon kaa bonus dene kaa faisla kiya he
 This time a bonus of 78 days will be given to 11 lakh 52 thousand employees of Railways
 is par railway kaa 2024 karod rupee kaa kharch aayega
 For the last 6 years, the Central Government has been giving bonus to railway employees continuously

 The biggest role in Mars work is that of Mars itself
 iske baad isamen tamaam shubh grahon kii bhoomika hoti he
 Jupiter also plays an important role in auspicious and Mars functions
 shani, rahu or ketu mangal kaaryon main aam taur par baadha dete hai
 When Mars is bad then it becomes a challenge to have Mars
 kab ghar main shubh kaary saralata se hote hai?- mangal grah ke anukool hone par shubh kaary aasaani se ho jate hai
 - Mangal works are done even when the moon is in auspicious state
 - brihaspati ke kundali main shubh hone par bhi mangal kaaryon kaa sanyog banataa he
 - Auspicious actions are made even after the landing of a half-and-half or dhaiya
 - kisi sant mahatma ke aashirwad milane par bhi aisa hota he
 When there are no Mars works in the house? - Life in Saturn is difficult when Saturn is walking
 - kundali main rahu kaa prabhaav karaab hone par mangal kaary nahin hote hai
 - Mars does not work even when Jupiter is inauspicious
 - ghar main niyamit kalah klesh hone par bhi shubh kaaryon ke yoga nahin banate hai
 - Such a situation arises even if the main gate of the house is damaged
 ghar main mangal kaary karaane ke upaay?- ghar main puja kaa sthaan banaaen or niyamit taur par puja upasna karen
 - Do group worship once a week at home
 - ghar main kalah klesh kam se kam karen
 - Put regular bandanavar at the main entrance of the house
 - ghar main niyamit bhajan kirthan kii dhwani aati rahe to uttam hoga

 The seriousness of the BSP regarding the rally can be gauged from the fact that the BSP has also booked about a dozen trains to bring its workers to the Ramabai Maidan, in view of which the railway has also become very cautious
 basapa kii raily ke chalate aam yatriyon ko pareshaaniyon kaa saamana na karnaa pade iske liye samachar patron ke madhyam se railgadiyon ke platform or samay badale jane kii soochna pehle hi jari kar di gai he

 baharhaal basapa ke sutron kii maane to raily main daliton or mahadaliton ke saath hi brahmanon kii bhi acchhee khaasi sankhya dikhne kii ummid he
 The party's think tank and national general secretary Satish Mishra are united day and night to bring the Brahmins to the rally venue
 basapa ke ek netaa ne to yahaan tak bataaya ki raily main aane vaale brahman samudaay ke logon ko khaastaur par yah nirdesh diya gaya he ki ve kurta-dhoti pahanakar va maathe par tilak lagaakar aaen taaki virodhiyon ko unki khaas maujuudagi kaa ehsaas ho sake
 The BSP leader said that a separate pandal is being arranged for the Brahmin activists so that they do not face any kind of problems

" ” In cricket, it is said that if the player is not in good form then he should not be selected in the team, no matter how experienced he is
 yah formula australia cricket main kaaphi lagu hota he
 When the experienced player is not in form, he is not selected in the Australia team
 isiilie australia team acha pradarshan karti he
 This formula should also be applied in the politics of India
 form main jo netaa nahin hai unke jagah nae netaaon ko tikat dena chahie
 This old leader should make him a non-playing captain like tennis, who kept on advising outside
 anubhav ko dekhte hue agar aap tikat denge to phir yah thakaa hua netaa chunaav main acha pradarshan nahin kar paayegaa
 It should never be thought that if the father is a big leader then the son will also win the election
 agar aisa hota to sunil gavaskar ke betaa rohan gavaskar bade khilaadi hote
 The sons of a film star would also become big movie stars
 cricketer or film star kii tarah netaaon ko khud pradarshan karnaa padegaa nahin to log riject kar denge
 Now come to the Congress
 congress VIP party banati ja rahi he
 Many big leaders of Congress consider this party as their property
 unka lagata he wo party kaa thekedaar hai
 The party runs because of them
 lekin unako samajhnaa chahie loktantr main janata sab kuch he
 Rahul Gandhi said in the CWC meeting on Saturday that Chidambaram had said that if his son did not get the ticket, he would leave the party
 kamalnath ne kaha ki meraa mukhyamantri hone kaa kya phayda agar main apane bete ko tikat nahin dilava sakuun
 Chhindwara is the seat of my family
 rahul gandhi ne kaha gahalot sahab hafte tak jodhpur main rahe
 But could not win the son
 jab party ke koi netaa blakemeling karata he to use turant party se nikaal dena chahie
 Rahul Gandhi needs to take this drastic step
 kamalnath kehete hai chhindwara unke parivaar kii seat he
 What is a family seat? Has Kamal Nath made this seat
 yah chunaav kshetra ko kharid liya he ? aise netaaon ko log aise hi jawaab dete hai or haraate hai
 Ashok Gehlot is the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, he should have gone everywhere in the state but for weeks he lived in Jodhpur to win his son, it means Gehlot was more serious than just his son Jyotiraditya Scindia also lost
 apni seat nahin bachaa paae
 People also say that Scindia always behaves like a king
 sindhiya ke peeche selfi lene ke liye gum rahaa aadmi agar sindhiya ko haraa de to yah badi baat he
 The defeat of Rahul Gandhi from Amethi is also a big defeat
 party ke adhyaksh ke rup main rahul gandhi ne is baar kaaphi mehnat kii
 Rahul Gandhi did not just roam in his constituency, he campaigned in almost all the states and sought votes for his candidates
 adhyaksh ke rup main apana ferj nibhaayaa
 Like Ashok Gehlot, if Rahul Gandhi had only set up the Amethi camp, he might have won
 lekin janata ne rahul gandhi ko haraaya or janata kii nirnay kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 This election has also won some criminal who should not have won
 loktantr main janata maalik he lekin janata ko hameshaa yah dekhnaa chahie jis ko vot de rahaa he uskaa back ground kya he ? us ke khilaaf kitne criminal cese hai lekin is cheez par koi dhyaan nahin detaa he
 Then the public cries when the leader does not work
 dilli ke logon ne aatishi ko haraa diya or gautam gambhir ko jeeta diya
 i believe this decision of the public is not right
 aatishi kai dinon se mehnat kar rahi hai
 Atishi did a great job for Delhi's education
 gautam gambhir ek acha cricketer he lekin raajnneeti main unka koi anubhav nahin he
 If you are making someone an MP by watching cricket, then the public is wrong here
 hansraj hans bhi jeet gaye unka kaa bhi raajnneeti main koi anubhav nahin he naa dilli ke liye wo kuch kiye hai
 People should not choose anyone and send them to Parliament just to make Narendra Modi the PM because it is not right for democracy
 dilli main congress ne aam aadmi party ke saath gathbandhan nahin kiya or puraane netaaon ko tikat de di
 If the Congress had formed an alliance, all the leaders would not have got the ticket
 congress jeetne se zyada chunaav ladane main vishwaas karti he
 Sheila Dixit got the ticket
 kya shila dikshit ko tikat milanaa chahie tha
 It is true that Sheela is a troubled good leader but everything has a time
 81 saal ke umr main chunaav main khadaa hona thik nahin tha
 In this case, the bjp's decision not to bring leaders above the age of 70 in the election is correct
 mahabal mishra, arvind singh lavali, ajay maakan jaise logon ko tikat mila
 Arvind Singh Lovely was the first Congress, left the Congress and went to the BJP and then came back to the Congress and got a ticket
 log yah tark dete hai ki vahaan sikh log zyada he to lavali ko tikat dekar thik kiya
 Is there only Lovely Sikh in the entire Congress? Is there no other Sikh leader in that constituency except Lovely? Congress should have made other leaders as an alternative
 odisha main congress puri tarah khatm hoti ja rahi he
 Here too leaders run their own arbitrariness
 nae logon ko mauka nahin miltaa he
 The Congress was once considered powerful in Odisha
 2000 tak odisha main zyaadaatar congress kii shashan rahaa, lekin 2000 ke baad odisha main congress kii haalat patali hoti chali gayi
 The leaders there only went to see their benefit
 log kya sochate hai us ke bare main nahin sochaa
 The people whom the people are rejecting again and again, give the Congress tickets to the same leaders in the next election
 odisha main congress main parivaarwaad zyada he
 Son or daughters get tickets in the name of the father
 isiilie odisha main congress kaa kor voter bijepi main shift kar gaya he
 The vote percentage of the Congress is continuously decreasing
 2014 main ko congress zyaadaatar jagah par duusare sthaan thi, lekin is baar tisare sthaan par aa gayi he
 The biggest problem with the Congress is that it does not give new people a chance in elections
 jin netaaon ko log baar-baar riject karte hai unhen tikat diya jaataa he
 Congress should learn from Naveen Patnaik in Odisha
 naveen patnayak lagaataar 19 saal se mukhyamantri hai or is baar jeet kar aaye hai
 It is no small thing to become Chief Minister five times in a row
 naveen kii planning ke saamne odisha main vipaksh puri tarah fail he
 In 2014, Modi wave also prevented Naveen from BJP in Odisha
 is baar bhi bijepi ko rokane main kaamyaab hue
 Naveen has given ticket to 33 percent women this time
 loksabhaa me jeetne ummidavaaron ko naveen ne tikat diya he kisi ke khilaaf criminal cese nahin he
 Many old leaders also changed their tickets
 2014 ke haar se congress kuch nahin siikhaa
 In these five years, Congress could not create new leaders or give new faces a chance
 rahul gandhi ko bhi aatmamanthan karnaa chahie
 There is a need to connect with people, there is a need to meet people
 is desh main matadaata hi sab kuch he
 He sometimes makes someone a hero and sometimes makes someone zero
 isiilie netaa apane aap ko hameshaa hero nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Voters are watching his performance
 rahul gandhi ke paas ek mauka he jo netaa pradarshan nahi kar rahe hai un netaaon non plaing captain bana de jo baahar baithkar apana salaah dete rahe
 Give new people a chance
 yuvaaon ko mauka de jo eemaandaaree se mehnat kar rahe hai nahin to phir congress ko congressi hi khatm kar degi

 samaajawaadee party ke sahyog se dharna sthal par bheed jute gai or mamata banerjee ne note bandi ke khilaaf kade tevar dikhaae
 Terming Modi's decision as a black emergency, Mamta said that the government is threatening leaders who oppose it
 or unako sibiai jaanch kaa dar dikhaa rahi he
 But challenging them, she said that she will continue to oppose it vigorously and if she has courage in the central government, then show her by sending her to jail

 Rahul Gandhi does not want to live in Punjab, but i have to live

 You cannot keep such people separate
 rahul gandhi rashtriya samasyaon kaa aadhunik tareeke se samaadhaan karnaa chaahate hai
 While this cannot happen
 aapke samaaj main adivasee bhi rahete hai, jo jamun or chamagadad khate hai
 This is the reality and they need to be exposed to the truth
 'amarinder singh ne kaha ki log unase congress chhodane ko kah rahe hai
 But for this the party leadership also needs to think whether it wants to overcome the problems in Punjab or not
 agar aisa nahin hota he to mujhe duusare vikalpon kii ore dekhnaa hoga

 sibiai chif alok verma ke maamle main supreme court ke faisle ke baad ab select cameti faisla karegi ki unhen pad se hataaya jaae yaa nahin
 The Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi will no longer attend this meeting of the Select Committee
 bataa den ki select cameti main sijeai, pradhanmantri or netaa vipaksh ko hona tha
 But CJI Ranjan Gogoi distanced himself from the Select Committee meeting
 unhone is hipavar cameti kii baithak ke liye justise eke sikri ko namankit kiya he
 The Select Committee will meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and opposition leader Mallikarjun Khagde
 yah cameti hi alok verma kaa bhavishya tay karegi
 This committee has to decide within a week whether Alok Verma will hold the post of CBI chief or not
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki chif justise ranjan gogoi ne hi alok verma kii yachika par sunwaayee kar faisla diya he, isliye unhone select cameti kii baithak se alag karke khud baithak main nahin ja rahe hai
 It is because of this that he has chosen the second number judge AK Sikri for this meeting in seniority
 bataa den ki isse pehle aaj yani buudhvaar kii subah sibiai chif alok verma sibiai mukhyalay pahunche
 Alok Verma returned to the CBI office on Wednesday, Wednesday and took over as director, where he was received by interim director Nageswara Rao
 haalanki, agle ek hafte tak vah koi nitigat faisla nahin le paaenge
 Let us know that after the government's decision to send Alok Verma on leave on October 23, his office located on the 10th floor was sealed
 unki jagah em nageshwar raav ko antarim nideshak niyukt kiya tha
 The central government suffered a major setback on Tuesday when the Supreme Court reinstated Alok Kumar Verma as the CBI director
 nyaayalay ne verma ko sibiai nideshak kii shaktiyon se vanchit kar avkaash par bhejne kaa centre sarkaar kaa aadesh radd kar diya
 However, the court made it clear on Verma that he would refrain from taking any major policy decision until the High Powered Committee, which selected the CBI chief after restoration, considered the issue of taking away his powers
 verma kaa sibiai nideshak ke taur par do varsh kaa kaarykaal 31 janvari ko samaapt ho rahaa he
 However, the sword of denying Verma the powers and rights still hangs on his head
 sheersh adaalat ne kaha he ki sibiai pramukh kaa chayan karne vaali ucchadhikaar praapt chayan samiti ab bhi verma se jude maamle par vichaar kar sakati he, kyonki sivisi unke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aaropon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The selection committee has been asked to call a meeting within a week
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki kanoon main antarim nilamban yaa sibiai nideshak ko hataane ke sambandh main koi praavdhaan nahin he
 The apex court made it clear that any such decision can be taken only after obtaining the consent of the selection consent
 pradhan nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi, nyaayamurti sanjay kishan kaul or nyaayamurti keem joseph kii teen sadasyeey peeth ne apane 44 pej ke faisle main verma ko unki shaktiyon se vanchit karne or sanyukt nideshak em nageshwar raav ko sibiai kaa antarim nideshak banaae jane sambandhi sivisi or carmik evam prashikshan vibhaag (diopiti) ke 23 oktober, 2018 ke adeshon ko nirast kar diya
 The bench said in its judgment that we consider it appropriate to direct that CBI Director Verma will not take any major policy decision and refrain from doing so until the committee is allowed to take such action or decision on his reinstatement
 yah faisla pradhan nyaayadhish ne likhaa, lekin chunki aaj vah upasthit nahin the isliye nyaayamurti kaul ne yah nirnay sunaaya
 Along with this, the court in its judgment also asked the High Powered Committee consisting of Prime Minister, Chief Justice and Leader of Opposition (leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha) to meet within a week

 essi / asti act main sanshodhan ke khilaaf 6 sitambar ko deshbhar main savarnon ne centresarkaarake khilaaf naaraazgi jaahir karte hue bharat band kiya
 This was the second such demonstration of the upper castes of the country after the Mandal movement in caste matters, in which they took to the road against the government
 ek samay wo tha jab purv pradhanmantrivipi sinhadwara mandal kamishan kii siforishein lagu karne ke virodh main savarna ugr hue the
 Today it is seen recurring when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government overturned the Supreme Court's decision, amended the SC / ST Act and restored it to its original form
 modi sarkaar ke is faisle se bijepi kaa mul vot bank (savarna) acroshit hokar sadakon par aa gaya
 VP Singh: The king who became a fakir, 'raja nahi fakir hai, deshde ki deshir', when this slogan will be heard in the ears of Manda Naresh and former Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, he must have once felt that the country The doors of opportunity that he has opened for the economically and socially backward, will put him again in the future at the peak of power
 veepi singh saamaajik nyaay ke maamle main sakaaratmak karrwai (affirmative action) ke pairokaar the
 Few people would know that while taking part in the Bhoodan movement, he donated most of his land to charity
 jiske liye unke parivaar waalon ne unase naata tod liya tha
 The BJP and other opposition parties' elite class were angry with VP Singh for implementing the recommendations of the Mandal Commission that they all came together to oust him from power
 yahaan tak veepi singh ke khilaaf unke hi samudaay ke chandrashekhar unke liye chunauti ban gaye
 At that time the United Front government of VP Singh was running on the crutches of the BJP
 desh main mandal kamishan kii charchaa thi
 But at that time, BJP leader LK Advani lifted the kamandal to make the Mandal movement a reality
 lalu yadav ne adwani kaa rath rokte hue unhen giraftaar kiya
 The BJP withdrew support from the United Front government and its government collapsed during a vote of confidence in Parliament
 iske baad jo hua wo itihaas he
 Despite being so committed to social justice, there are many who remember him as a villain
 unka virodh karne vaale maanate hai ki unhone apane raajnneetik swaarth saadhane ke liye mandal kamishan kii siforeeshon ko lagu kiya tha
 The politics of ethnic identity after the Ram Mandir movement found it sitting in the lap of Hindutva
 aaj bhaajapa ko lekar pichde varg main jo utsaah dikhataa he, vaisaa veepi singh kaa iraadaa bilkul nahin tha
 Narendra Modi: We are a fakir man, we will have to carry the bag! About 10 years after the death of VP Singh, another 'fakir' is taking charge of the country
 yaad kariye disambar 2016 main pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa muradabad main diya wo bhaashan jisamen unhone kaha ki 'ham to fakir aadmi hai, jhola lekar chal padenge'
 There is no doubt that in making Modi the Prime Minister, the country rose above caste and gave him so many seats
 lekin yah bhi asaty nahin he ki jaateey sangharsh kii aag kahin na kahin us raakh ke neeche ab bhi dadhak rahi thi, jise mandal andolan ke dauraan kamandal ne shant kar diya tha
 However, the Supreme Court's decision on the SC / ST Act, followed by the nationwide agitation of Dalits and then the government reversing the order of the Supreme Court, amending the Act and implementing it in its original form
 in sab ghatnakramon ne phir se us aag ko hawa de di he jo kahin dabi hui thi
 The upper castes are the original vote bank of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which the BJP cannot ignore
 to vahiin jin pichhadi or anusuchit jati / janajatiyon ne pradhanmantri modi par bharosa kiya unki andekhi bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 This question was raised loudly in the meeting of Chief Ministers of BJP ruled states with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah in Delhi recently
 tamaam mukhyamantriyon ne pradhanmantri ko is faisle ko lekar savarnon kii naaraazgi se avgat bhi karaayaa
 The meeting also mentioned how an organized campaign is being conducted on Facebook, whatsapp and other social media platforms, appealing to the upper castes to opt for NOTA in the upcoming elections
 desh or pradesh ke halaat par charchaa ke baad savarnon ke andolan ne modi sarkaar or bijepi ko dharmsankat main daal diya he
 The strategy of gathering Hindu society divided among castes in the name of religion is once again seen breaking in the name of caste
 itihaas dekhen to aane vaale samay main modi sarkaar ko apane is faisle kaa khamiyaja bhi bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Because despite taking such a big decision regarding social justice, former Prime Minister VP Singh was marginalized in public life
 darasal is desh kii raajnneeti kaa ek katu satya he ki jo bhi apane jati samooh ke hiton se upar uthakar kaam karegaa wo saarvajanik jivan main haashie par chalaa jayega
 Because our country's democracy has turned into an electoral system, which all political parties take care of or are forced to keep

 You may not have seen bamboo flowers, because this flower blooms only once in many years
 aisa kareeb har adtalis saal baad hota he jab bans ke jangal main phool khilte hai
 Rats eat it when the bamboo blossoms bloom and this increases the fertility of the mice greatly and in Indian proverbs and idioms, blossoming in the bamboo forest is considered inauspicious
 vajah yahi he ki ek khetihar desh bharat main agar chuuhe atyadhik ho jaaen to wo fasalon ko chaupat karenge or akaal kii ashanka bad jaaegi
 It is a matter of 1959

 mizoram main kareeb do dashak tak chale us khooni sangharsh main hajaaron log maare gaye, laapata hue or beghar ho gaye
 That separatist movement was also supported by money and weapons from Pakistan and the leaders of the separatist organization often used to go to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)
 jab algaavvaadiyon ne mizoram ke mukhya shahar lungleh par kabja kar kshetra ko bhartiya sangh se aaazaad karne kii ghoshnaa kar di to bharat sarkaar ko pehali baar apni hi janata ke khilaaf vayusena ke istemaal ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 This led to separatists taking refuge in the forest and causing considerable loss of life and property

 ’captain ne kahaaki team kii haar ke liye sahaayak staff ko doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa, yah vyakti ke upar nirbhar he ki vah jarurat ke hisaab se kya ranneeti apanaataa he
 Dhoni was talking to reporters on Sunday night after losing three ODI series 0-2 to Bangladesh
 unhone kaha, ‘agar aap log paroksh rup se yah sanket dena chaah rahe hai ki hamen coach kii jarurat he hamaare paas kaaphi sporting staff he jo khilaadiyon kaa dhyaan rakh sakate hai

 'team India may have beaten Bangladesh in every department but captain Dhoni defended his players saying,' We have a team of best players

 vahiin, bijepi savarna, gaiyr yadav obisi or gaiyr jatav dalit matadaataaon ke sahare 2014 jaise nattejey dohraane kii baat kah rahi he
 However, the Congress has been uplifted by its victories in three states
 aise main muqabla trikoniya hone kii sambhaavna dikh rahaa he
 In the political struggle of the state, no one seems to be less than anyone
 aise main sapa-basapa soobe main modi ko maat nahin de pate hai to phir unke saamne siyaasi sankat khadaa hona laazmi he
 The challenge to save survival for the SP-BSP is that Mayawati has steadily lost base since the 2012 Assembly elections in UP
 unki party lagaataar do vidhansabha chunaav haar chuki he or loksabhaa main unka khaataa tak nahin khulaa he
 Currently, the BSP has 19 mlas in UP, but there is not a single member of the Lok Sabha
 vahiin, sapa 2014 main maat khaane ke baad 2017 main akhilesh yadav ko satta ganvaani padi
 The SP has just 47 mlas, the lowest in the party's history
 aise main sapa-basapa milakar 2019 main koi bada karishma nahin kar pate hai to donon dalon ko apane astitv ko bachaae rakhana bahut mushkil hoga
 dalit-obc votebank's claim will be weak
 The Dalit voter of the state is considered to be the original bank of the BSP
 yahi vajah he ki 2014 main kareeb 19 fisadi or 2017 main basapa ko 21 fisadi ke kareeb vot mila he
 At the same time, the traditional vote bank of SP is considered OBC along with Yadav and Muslim
 isi ke maddenjar sapa-basapa ne gathbandhan kiya he, lekin iske baavjood agar bijepi ko maat nahin de pate hai to phir donon partiyon ke votbank kaa jhukaav duusare dalon kii taraf ho saktaa he
 The anti-modi campaign will weaken the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh is being seen as a major political force in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 donon dalon raajnneetik or jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se kaaphi majboot bhi hai
 In such a case, even if this political experiment is not successful against Modi, then at least in UP, the anti-modi campaign will get a big blow
 soobe main rashtriya dal haaavee hongespa-basapa milakar chunavi maidan main bijepi ko nahin haraa pate hai to aisi haalat main donon dalon ke votbank chhitak sakate hai
 In such a situation, the traditional votes of these two parties can turn to national parties
 agar aisa hota he to congress or bijepi- donon dalon ko isse takat milegi

 The Game of lifestardew valleybloons TD 5grand Theft Auto: San Andreas samadhi kya he? kya vaaki samadhi kaa koi sach he? kya sachmuch koi insaan dinon, maheenon yaa saalon tak samadhi main jane ke baad waapas jinda laut saktaa he? samadhi ko lekar ye sawaal sadiyon se rahe hai, lekin bihar main ek baba ke 15 dinon kii bhu-samadhi ne inhen phir se jinda kar diya he
 Pramod Baba of Madhepura stayed under the ground without eating and drinking for so many days and then came out, but what was it? Any miracle of Baba or any game of tricking people? Actually, 30-year-old Pramod is a resident of Purnia district of Bababihar, but if people believe, he has made this village named Bhagatama Jiromile of Madhepura his work place
 
 is baar unhone apane isi karmbhumi main pandrah dinon kii bhu-samadhi le kar sabko chaunkaa diya he
 When Baba revealed that those who wish to perform Bhoomi Samadhi, Baba last month announced to perform Vishnumahayagya for the welfare of the people and expressed his desire for this Bhoomi Samadhi before Yajna
 baba nae hote, to shaayad unki shaktiyon par ek baargi logon ko shaq bhi hota, lekin saalon se isigaanv manjame baba ke bhakton ko isamen kuch bhi atapata nahin laga
 The food was not eaten for the last 12 years
 The preparations for the mausoleum of these Mouni Baba, who were supposedly eating without food and without speaking, started for more than 12 years
 kareeb hafte bhar membabaki samadhi ke liye bich maidan main 10 meter lambii or 14 feet gahari ek surang khod daali gai
 When Babafir went missing in the tunnel, Baba went missing in the tunnel at 2
30 pm on 28 February
 yahaan tak bhi sabakuch thik-thaak tha, lekin phir baba ke hukum par surang ke munh ko bans kii kamanion or mitti se dhank diya gaya or surang ke andar baba ne samadhi lekar puja paath shuru kar di
 For fifteen days, Baba camped under the tunnel under the ground and the devotees' shout began outside
 baba or unki surang kii ek jhalak paane ke liye samadhi sthal par hajaaron kii bheed lag gai
 The whole area began to resonate with shouts and Baba's Bhoomi Samadhi was celebrated in the face of the fair
 is bich pandrah dinon tak baba ke jameen ke neeche rahane ko lekar jitani munh utani baaten thim
 It was a miracle for Babakisi to come out after 15 days, Baba ji's game for someone
 in tamaam baton ke bich sabase bada sawaal yahi tha ki kya 15 dinon ke baad baba sachmuch apni bhu-samadhi se sahi-salaamat baahar niklenge yaa phir ye samadhi unki aakhri samadhi sabit hogi
 Contrary to all the natural rules and laws, Baba surprised everyone by going out after 15 days
 mauni baba ke naam se mashhoor hai pramod babamauni baba ke naam se mashhoor pramod baba jab samadhi ke liye jameen ke neeche gaye, to baahar mela lag gaya
 From havan pujans to jayakars, the stage started, but neither saw Baba going under the ground nor did anyone come out
 saarvajanik jagah par hui is samadhi se media ke tamaam camaron ko bhi dur rakhaa gaya
 So, was the truth of samadhi hidden in this tomb taken away from the eyes of the people? Even the district administration of Madhepura has been keeping silent fast, while none of his devotees and devotees have kept this question straight and Unclear is not ready to answer
 vaise baba kii samadhi or bhakton ke is rele ke aage khud madhepura kaa jila prashasan bhi natmastak he
 That is why even after the government officials of the area reached here and tried to stop Baba from taking Samadhi, he could not succeed in his intention and he had to return
 samadhi ke naam par antardhyaan hue baba ko 15 dinon tak kisi ne nahin dekha or thik aakhri roj wo achaanak sabake saamne namoodaar ho gaye
 Now call it miracle, superstition or Baba ji's game

 faqat do maheene pehle ek sho ke dauraan donon kii dubai main mulaakaat kya hui, donon hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye ek-duje ke hokar rah gaye
 They fell in love at first sight and then both got married
 lekin abhi ye khubasurat jodi apni shaadishuda jindagi thik se ji paati usase pehle hi is lav story main ek twist aa gaya
 Suicide falling from the tenth floor, the high-rise building in the posh area of ahmadabad, the land from the tenth floor of Sachin Tower, is counted down and dies
 or is tarah faqat do maheene kii ek choti si lav story kaa di and ho jaataa he magar kuch sawaalon ke saath
 Did Bhoomi leap from the tenth floor itself? Is Bhoomi Nekhudkushiki? Or did someone push the land from above? But suddenly a new revelation takes place when these solvers still get more air
 bhoomi kaa ek dost saamne aata he or kahata he ki marane se bas das minute pehle bhoomi ne use ek esemes kiya tha
 In the SMS he wrote - Suicide at Sachin Tower
 kya he massej ke peeche kaa rajlekin kya yahi sach tha? yaa phir is esemes ke peeche bhi koi or raaj tha? kahin aisa to nahin ki kisi ne bhoomi ke mobile phone se uske dost ko ye esemes bhej kar maut ke sach par pardaa daalane kii koshish kii?kyon chunaa sachin towerlekin in tamaam baton ke bich jo sabase hairaan karanevaali baat thi wo bhoomi kaa sachin tower main jaakar khudakushi karnaa
 Actually, Kunal neither had anything to do with the Sachin tower nor the land
 naa hi donon yahaan rahete the or naa hi unka koi jaankaar yahaan rahata tha
 Yes, it is so sure that the land of the Sachin tower which fell down from the tenth floor died, just behind the Sachin tower was the studio of the husband of the land i
e
 RJ Kunal
 aise main agar bhoomi ne khudakushi kii bhi to usne maut ke liye sachin tower ko hi kyon chunaa?sirf pati kaa offis paas he isliye koi paas kii building se jaakar chalaang maare ye baat ajeeb lagati he
 In this story, Bhumi or Kunal had only such a relationship with this building
 lekin building se baahar kunal or bhoomi ke rishte ne aisi kya karavat lee ki sarikahanedo maheene main hi khatm ho gai? The Taliban is now showing strength against Pakistan

 The exercise to form a government here is fast, but the sequence of allegations and counter-allegations that are going on is not only confusing but also a kind of disappointment
 darasal yahaan kii raajnneeti main ubaal laane kaa shrey aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ko jaataa he, jinhone apane puraane andaaj main bijepi par aaropon kii jhadi laga di
 He first said that the party is luring his mlas, then said that he is breaking the Congress mlas and when it did not work, then directly accused Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung that on Thursday, he will make BJP a government Going to invite kejariwal hameshaa kii tarah haahaakaar machaate hue tamaam tarah ke bayaan radio, tivi or postaron ke jariye dete dikhe
 He began to tell 'everything' like an interim
 loksabhaa chunaav main buree tarah parajeet kejariwal ke liye dilli ab ek mahatvapurn thikaana he or vidhansabha main bahumat unke liye astitv kaa sawaal he
 The mistake he made the last time he resigned from the post of Chief Minister, he wants to atone again by forming a government here, which does not seem possible
 zaahir he ki vah nahin chaahate ki yahaan bijepi kii sarkaar bane or isliye ek kushal raajnneetijna kii tarah pehle se hi party par duusari party ke vidhayakon ko todane kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 But there is no concrete truth yet in his allegations
 itnaa hi nahin uparajyapal par lagaaya gaya yah aarope ki vah sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi ko bulaayenge, betuka he
 The BJP is the party with the largest number of members in the Delhi Legislative Assembly and if the Lt
 Governor calls it to form the government, then this law will not be wrong
 uparajyapal ne kejariwal ko mauka diya or unhone sarkaar banaai
 But he then resigned himself crying, as if he was being unfairly there
 ab vah yah nahin chaahate ki bijepi ko sarkaar banane ke liye nyauta mili
 This would be wrong in their eyes
 unki is tuialki soch se pataa chalata he ki dilli main sarkaar par vah apana haq samajhate hai
 And perhaps that's why he wants to meet Congress and form his government
 lekin yah itnaa aasaan nahin he or iske kya dushprinaam honge, uskaa unhen jaraa bhi andaja nahin he
 His party, which is fast losing popularity, will fall so far from the eyes of the public after forming such a government that they will also have to struggle to save their assembly seats
 jahaan tak bijepi kii baat he, to party ko sarkaar banane ke lobh se bachanaa hoga or kuch vidhayakon kii is tarah kii maang se alag rahete hue phir se chunaav karwaane ke bare main baaten kerani chahie
 Delhi BJP should avoid any defections or horse-trading
 aisa karnaa puri party ke liye ghaatak hoga or jo sammaan party ne paaya he vah matiamet ho jayega
 Hopefully, instead of improperly forming the government, the BJP will prepare for the election
 isamen hi loktantr kii bhalaai he

 pichley maheene khabar ai ki mumbai se sate uran main paanch aatankwaadi ghus aae hai
 After this, a combing operation was carried out, intensive investigation was done, the news of the terrorists came out wrong, but the investigation revealed many more things
 pataa laga ki desh ke sabase bade container bandargah jawaharlal nehru port trust (jeenpiti) main pichley paanch saalon main alag-alag vajahon se hazaron kii taadaad main jabt container suraksha ke liye bada khatra hai, kyonki saalon-maheenon biit jane ke baad bhi inaki nilaamee nahin hui he, or inamen se kai contenron main visphotak bhi hai
 In JNPT, about 7,000 containers have been seized in the last five years, which have been kept in different 32 freight stations, ie CFS, for many years
 in contenron main se 282 main gola-barood jaise khatarnaak or jvalansheel padaarth hai, 50 contenron main china se aae pataakhe hai
 The total value of these containers is around Rs 2,500 crore
 jeenpiti ke dipti chairman niraj bansal khud maanate hai, "1,000 din se upar kaa holding period ho gaya, itane vailu kaa saamaan lowep padaa he, aane vaale time main zyada active hone kii zarurat he
 
 
 " in fret steshnon kii suraksha kitni lachar he, iskaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kuch din pehle custom ke godaamon se taskaron ne chandan kii lakdi se bhare teen container chura liye the, jisaki shikaayat khud custom adhikariyon ne nhava-sheva police stesan main darj karai thi
 The jnpt's two terminals have a movement of 4
5 million containers every year, so the seized containers are a big headache for the JNPT itself
 tippaniyan According to Bansal, there are a number of reasons for containers to remain there for years, ranging from non-receipt of NOC (no Objection Certificate) from different agencies
 unhone kaha, "hamane zabt kiya
 
 
 After checking the luggage, the custom sees whether the duty is full or not
 
 
 uske baad nilaamee hoti he

 " There is also a concern on the port scanners, which are insufficient to check the containers coming here

 The security of these freight stations can be gauged from the fact that a few days ago, smugglers stole three containers filled with sandal wood from the customs warehouses, which the Customs themselves complained about
 Was lodged in jeenpiti ke do terminlon se har saal 45 lakh contenron kii awajahi hoti he, so, aise main ye jabt container khud jeenpiti ke liye bada sirdard hai

 He said, "we confiscated

 kashmir ghati ek baar phir ubal rahi he
 And whenever such situations arise, a section on social media leaves no chance to blame Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru

 On 27 September 1947, a month before the tribal attack on Kashmir, Pandit Nehru wrote a letter to Sardar Patel and warned him that Patel could not implement it
 navajivan prakaashan mandir ke ‘sardaar patel chunaa hua patr vyavhaar’ bhaag ek main yah patr prakashit hue hai
 Here are its special parts - 1
 kashmir kii paristhiti khatarnaak he or bighad rahi he
 The Muslim League is preparing to enter the state of Kashmir in large numbers in Punjab and in the north-west Frontier Province
 2
 Kashmir's relations with the rest of India will be cut during the winter
 main samajhataa hum ki pakistan kii vyuh rachana abhi kashmir main chupake se ghus jane kii he or aagaamee sheetarutu ke kaaran kashmir kam-zyada hindustan se cat jaay tab badi sainik karrwai karne kii he
 3
 mujhe andeh he ki maharaja or unke rajya kii senaayen lok sahaayta ke bina swayan hi is sthiti kaa saamana kar sakenge
 4
 shaikh abdulla or neshnal conference ke netaaon ko jail se mukt kar diya jaae, unase mitrataa saadhane kaa praytn kiya jaae, unka sahyog maanga jaae, uske baad bhartiya sangh main milane kii ghoshnaa kii jaae
 Once the state of Kashmir joins India, it will become very difficult for Pakistan to invade Kashmir in an authorized or unauthorized manner without coming into Indian struggle
 5
 Sheikh Abdullah is very keen to stay away from Pakistan and is very grounded for our consultations
 6
 No one can guarantee what will happen in today's complicated situation
 parantu maine jo rasta sujhaayaa he, vah mujhe zyada se zyada samajhadaari bharaa lagata he or uskaa koi parinaam nikalne kii zyada se zyada sambhaavna he
 But the important thing is that it should not be delayed
 isamen samay ke mahatv ko bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa, agar vilamb kiya gaya to sheetkaal ke aagaman se ham kashmir se puri tarah cat jaaenge
 7
 aapaki salaah swaabhaavik rup se maharaj par kaaphi asar daalegi
 i hope that you will take such a step in this matter that increases the speed of events and turns them in the right direction
 neshnal conference ke saath sahi vyavhaar kiya jaae, to vah hamaare liye bade laabh kii sabit ho sakati he
 It would be very sad to lose this profit
 shaikh abdulla ne baar-baar is baat kaa aashwaasan diya he ki ve sahyog karnaa chaahate hai
 They have also said that they will work as per my advice
 8
 i will say once more that time is of great importance in this matter and all things should be done in such a manner that with the cooperation of Sheikh Abdullah, Kashmir should join the Indian Union at the earliest

 aaj unki ginati ek acchhee actresus main kii jaati he
 But it was not so easy for him to stay in the industry
 ek intervyuu main unhone kaha ki industry main kisi par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 People here also mislead you
 compitishan itnaa he ki kuch auraten role ke liye produsar ke saath sone ko taiyaar ho jaati hai
 Richa spoke openly on the side effects of nepotism, GST and being an outsider herself
 venice main ali fazal sang rah rahi he richaa chaddha, kya kar rahe hai ek duusare ko dibehaal hi main jab richaa chaddha ne indian akpress ko intervyuu diya to unhone kai muddon parbebaak batenki
 When asked how difficult it is to handle a producer's deal in exchange for a role? In response Richa said, it is very difficult
 mujhe in sab chizon par gussa aata he
 i am angry with the women who are ready to sleep with the producer for the role
 kyonki kahin naa kahin log hamase is baat kii ummid karte hai
 Richa said, people in the industry also mislead you
 jab mujhe phukare mili thi to kai logon ne is project ko naa karne kii salaah di
 But later it was revealed that he is approaching this role for his close ones
 log aapse dosti karte hai, aapaki agali film ke bare main jaankaree jutate hai
 Then go to the producer himself and try to grab your role
 kuch auraten to produsar ke saath samjhauta bhi kar leti hai
 i lost a lot of my projects this way
 unhone bahucharchit nepotism par bolte hue kaha, jaise hi star kid paidaa hota he media har ek clic ke liye peeche peeche chali jaati he
 Even baby diapers are photographed
 star kids pehle se hi parfect package hote hai
 They have everything from PR to stylist
 unhen is baat kii chintaa nahin rahati ki ek flats ko teen ladakiyon ke saath share karnaa he
 This is a difference that no one understands
 a post shared by Richa Chadha (@therichachadha)onsep 27, 2017 at 4:00am pdtrica ne oe lucky oe se filmi kariyar kii shuruuaat kii thi
 But then he took 4 years for the next film
 is par unhone kaha, us dauraan main theatre kar rahi thi
 i was looking for some interesting projects
 jab maine gangs of vasepur kii tab mere paas manager, piaar, stylist koi nahin tha
 We are not a guide to outsiders, we are not a groomer
 richaa ne gstora notebandi ke industry par ho rahe prabhaav par kaha, main bollywood kebijaness modelase gussa hum
 No film is working, yet there are reports that it has earned crores
 GST or notebandi ke baad logon ke paas paise nahin hai
 The screens are less and taxation is higher
 logon ko samaj nahin aa rahaa ki aane vaale saalon main industry khatm ho jaaegi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not even indifferent from the time of Canada that there were voices of opposition to the indo-canadian uranium agreement there
 canada kii green party ne bharat ke saath lakhon dollar ke uranium saude ko lekar gambhir chintaa jataai or kaha ki samjhauta parmaanu aprasar sandhi kaa sidhaa ulanghan he
 Leader of the Green Party of Canada Elizabeth May said, "canada's trade with India in the nuclear materials sector is a direct violation of the nuclear treaty, yet in 2013 we started trading equipment and fissile material with India
 parmaanu aprasar sandhi antarrashtriya samjhauta he jiskaa uddeshy parmaanu shastron kaa prasar rokna he
 Elizabeth said, "india has expressed a desire to implement a comprehensive plan for a nuclear-free world and has voluntarily adopted a no-use policy
" main canadai pradhanmantri stephen harper se maang karti hu ki enpiti ke ulanghan ko badhaava milane se roke
 '- From input language PM narendra modi ke 'mishan yoga' ko devband ke daarul ulum kaa samarthan mil gaya he
 Darul Uloom has issued a statement saying that there is no need for a fatwa against yoga, it is an exercise
 dilli main guuruuvaar ko muslim ulema ne aayush mantri shripad nayak se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki jo log yoga kaa virodh kar rahe hai, ve yaa to siyasat kar rahe hai yaa phir maanavtaa ke dushman hai
 Azam also admitted that yoga is related to health
 On the other hand, Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan also said that kiog is a twin issue of health
 lekin unhone bijepi saansadayogi adityanath ke surya namaskara vaale bayaanpar aapatti jataai
 He may have described yoga as an exercise, but Yogi Adityanath was critical of him
 ajam khan ne kaha, 'jo chijen dharm se judi hai, hamaara us par aitraaj nahin he
 No religion can be imposed on another religion
 
 
 ye ek physical eksrasij he, jise log karnaa chaahate hai, to karen
 i am not saying anything to Yogi Adityanath that he should start offering Namaz
 ''muslim shloke kii jagah allaah kaa naam le sakate hai'yoga ke aadhikarik kaarykram se 'surya namaskara' ko hataane ke baad centre sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko muslimon se antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke aayojan main shaamil hone kii apil karte hue kaha ki is maukey par shloke padhanaa jaruri nahin he
 Minister of the Ministry of AYUSH, Shripad Naik, who is coordinating for the ceremony held on 21 June at Rajpath, said that Muslims can take the name of Allah instead of reciting verses during the event
 gujarat ke botad jila ke devaalia gaanv main ek garbhvatee mahila kii kahani behad dardanaak he
 The woman, who had been a victim of rape for about eight months, is now pregnant
 garbh main pal rahe balaatkaariyon ke bachche ko giraanaa chaahati he
 But the Gujarat High Court has refused to allow it
 gujarat ke botad zila ke devaalia gaanv main kaanse or steel ke bartanon se saje kamare main ek charpai par chupchaap leti hui ye mahila sirf rosemara ke kaamkaaj nipataane yaa apni aath maheene kii dardanaak kahani police yaa media waalon ko sunaane ke liye hi uthati hai
 The 23-year-old gang-rape victim says, "they raped me every day for about eight months
" chaar log to niyamit the, baaki aate-jate rahete the
 If i had done something that he did not like, he would have beaten it
 mujhe rone main bhi dar lagata tha
 The Gujarat High Court dismissed the petition last week for the miscarriage of a seven-month-old girl, who once had a happy daughter, wife and mother
 ab vah apane maayke main hi rah rahi he
 The eyes of his parents also remain on him
 vah kahati hai, 'yah mere balaatkaariyon kaa baccha he
 i am its mother but if this child stays with me then no one will accept me and my family
 adaalat ne garbhpaat kii ijaajat nahin di
 i request the government to take this child in its custody and give it to an orphanage
 'parivaar ke andar bechaini saaf najar aati he
 The victim may not fully agree with the idea of abandoning the unborn child
 bachche ko apane paas rakhane ke sawaal par vah chup ho jaati hai or dhire se apni maa kii ore dekhati hai
 His mother replies, 'how can it keep a child? If it does, the society and the village will boycott us
 mere do or bachche hai
 My 14 year old boy will remain a bachelor
 koi bhi hamaari izzat nahin karegaa
 She says, 'this is the mother but the child belongs to the rapists, we cannot keep her
 ' jab maa yah kah rahi thi to peedita ek kursi par sir jhukaae or pallaa odhe baithi hui thim
 She can hardly talk about the horror and shock
 un dinon kaa zikr uski ankhon main aansu le aata he
 Seeing his 18-month-old son playing rabbit meat, she says, 'at night he used to go in the forest to hunt rabbits and black deer
 do log mere saath ruk jate or galat kaam (balaatkaar) karte
 Then the other two would come in place of those two
 maheenon tak har raat yahi hota rahaa
 When the victim's in-laws prevented her from entering the house, her husband also left the house and came along
 vah kahati hai, 'ek raat jab mere aparankartaaon ne ek khargosh ko kaata to uske pet main se do nanhen khargosh nikle
 i could not resist myself and immediately lifted one of them which started nibbling my fingers
 isse mujhe apane bacchon kii yaad aa gai or maine ronaa shuru kar diya
 In the complaint to the police, the victim has named seven people and told that he used to beat her continuously
 baat karte hue uske haath or jabaan kaanpate hai
 She says, 'seeing me cry, one got angry and he started beating me with his gun, in which the rest also joined
 us ghatana ke baad unhone kuch din tak mujhe bhookha rakhaa
 When i asked for food, they gave me rabbit meat, which i could not eat
 ''balaatkaar nahin liv-in sambandh'peedita ke pati ne pichley saal july main surat main apni patni ke laapata hone kii police report darj karwaai thi
 Her life was going smoothly in the city before the victim was kidnapped
 peedita ke parivaar ko unhen dhundne ke liye police or netaaon ke chakkar kaatane pade lekin koi madad nahin mili
 The accused hail from the Dafar community, a nomadic caste of Gujarat
 peedita gujarat ke devi poojak samudaay kii hai
 Five of the seven named accused have been arrested
 is maamle main gujarat police kii bhoomika par bhi gambhir sawaal uthe
 The victim's mother says, "A few days after her disappearance, i came to know about her kidnappers
 maine police ko bataaya to unhone kaha ki vah apni marji se unke saath rah rahi he or usne yah likhakar diya he ki uske liv-in sambandh hai
 But who signs on paper of his own free will to be imprisoned and raped
 police ne meri baat par yakeen nahin kiya
 "but the investigating officer of the case, Police Vice President Tejas Patel, is unaware of this," i do not know about such behavior with the victim or her family
 hamane paanch abhiyukton ko giraftaar kar liya he
 The village sarpanch, an accused, has taken a stay order from the court against his arrest and is absconding
 'exiaar nahin likhilekin peedita or unke parijan police par gambhir aarope lagaate hai
 The victim's family friend, Sardar Singh Mori, says, "the victim and her mother hid in the jungle for hours after they managed to escape from the occupation of the kidnappers, after which they gathered courage and went to the police
" lekin jaisi ashanka thi sthaneey pulicekarmiyon ne shikaayat likhane se inkaar kar diya or phir hamane mahila police helpline ko phone kiya jiske baad na chaahate hue bhi hamaari shikaayat likhi gai
 The victim was taken for medical examination 48 hours after the FIR
 haalanki maamle ke court main jane or rashtriya akhabaaron kii surkhiyaan banane ke baad gujarat police ke varisht adhikariyon ne maamle kaa nirikshan shuru kiya
 Facing rage over the role of police officers in the case, the Gujarat government on Thursday gave a financial aid of Rs 20,000 to the victim
 uske liye ab balaatkaar or garbh main pal rahe bachche ko paidaa karne kii mushkil se zyada badi chunauti he 'pavitra' hone kii kavayad ko paar karnaa

 The tsunami of economic recession has engulfed the whole world
 asar bharat bhi padaa he lekin jahaan puri duniya ko is mandi ne behaal kar diya he, bharat kaa bazaar shuruaati jatke khaakar phir puraane raste par aata najar aa rahaa he
 One reason for this is the large population of India, which saved the country to a great extent from the recession
 lagaataar badhati hui aabaadi beshak kabhi bharat ke liye boj thi, lekin yahi aabaadi bhartiya udyogon main jaan phoonk rahi he
 In a world where demand has suddenly decreased, it has had less impact on India
 khaskar jo chijen sidhe- sidhe aam aadmi se taalluk rakhti hai, unki maang main zyada asar dekhne ko nahin mila he
 Statistics are confirming this
 misaal ke taur par mobile conection ko hi lijie
 In January alone, one crore 53 lakh people got new connections, whereas in December this figure was just around one crore
 emmemasiji sector yani sabun, tel, toothpaste jaise saamaanon kii khapat bhi bad rahi he
 26 in this sector as compared to last year
 4 fisadi kii growth dekhne ko mili he
 The situation is also similar in the auto sector
 sirf do-teen maheene lag rahaa tha ki is sector main kisi kii naukari salaamat nahin he, lekin aankade bataate hai ki gaadiyaan bik rahi hai
 While there was a slight break in vehicle sales in December, sales rose 32 per cent in January
 duusare sectoron main bhi suunaapan khatm hota dikh rahaa he
 People's interest in buying houses is rekindling
 yahi vajah he ki cement or steel jaise sectoron main raunak laut rahi he
 After three consecutive months of decline in the steel sector, the market once again looks like May 2008
 cement udyog main bhi pichley saal ke mukaable growth main 11 fisadi kaa izapha hua he
 That is, after several weeks of darkness, the light of hope has started to appear
 ab zarurat is baat kii he ki jab mahangaai dar kam ho hi gai he to byaaj daren or kam karke bazaar main paisa daalaa jaae taaki udyog ek baar phir apni puraani chaal main laut aaen
 Now the question is what the Indian economy is asking for
 agar sahi samay par kuch sahi faisle le liye gaye to bharat main aarthik mandi kaa asar sabase kam hoga
 If demand is increasing then the industries and businesses will also increase, jobs will be saved and salary will also increase
 lekin mandi kii aandhi main maar kha chuki arthvyavastha ke liye sirf itnaa hi jaruri nahin he
 The need is that this demand should be constant
 duniya main kahin bhi aandhi uthe to uskaa asar ham tak pahunche jarur, magar aisa na ho ki ham bhi us aandhi main ud jaaen
 Constantly falling inflation has given us a chance
 aaj ye dar chaar fisadi se neeche he
 When there was such a situation 13 months ago, our growth rate was above nine percent, but today the danger is that it can go below seven percent
 is khatre kii vajah talashna mushkil nahin he
 In the last 13 months, raising money on debt for the industry has become like breaking stars from the sky
 lagaataar badhati byaaj daron ne bade-bade audyogic gharaanon kii qamar tod di he
 Millions of small businessmen have had to close shop
 byaaj kii maar real estate, auto or kanjumar guds sector par kisi padi he, ye bataane kii jarurat nahin he
 But today, after the rate of inflation has come down and the price of crude in the international market is reduced by three quarters, we have the opportunity to give cheap loans to our industries and consumers, increase production, along with it to increase consumption
 Please arrange also
 logon par mandi kii maar padi he, ab unako isse bane maukey kaa phayda uthaane diya jaae
 If the houses are cheap, then such an atmosphere should be created that people can buy them
 loha or cement sasta hua he to logon ko itnaa paisa bhi diya jaae to wo apana makaan bana saken
 If fuel has become cheaper, arrangements should be made to make travel even cheaper
 saath hi is baat kaa bhi khyal rakhen ki mandi kii aad main munafavsuli na ho
 The help that the government gives, it should not go in the pocket of some people from the back door
 kyonki phayda jab aam aadmi tak pahonchega, tabhi wo mandi ko thenga dikhaane kii himmat karegaa
 Many big companies also suffered losses due to the recession
 iskaa sidhaa asar padaa logon kii naukariyon par
 a large number of people became unemployed, but according to a survey, the situation in India seems to be improving
 videshon kii tarah naukariyon par sankat apane desh main bhi aayaa
 Thousands of people have lost their jobs
 chunaav se thik pehle sarkaar ke liye bhi isse mushkilen badi hai
 To leave someone's job means to vote
 aise main sarkaar ab companiyon se kah rahi he ki beshak company ke bade adhikariyon kii tankhwaah kaatani pade, lekin logon kii naukari jarur bachani chahie
 The government's concern is genuine, but the matter of relief is that even now there are many industries where there is a need of the people
 haal main hue ek survey ke mutabik desh kii 63 fisadi companiyaan ab bhi logon ko naukariyaan de rahi hai or mahaz 13 fisadi companiyaan chantni kii soch rahi hai
 Nine out of every ten companies are giving promotions to their employees and less than one per cent are cutting their salaries
 survey ke mutabik bharat main is saal ausatan 8
 Salary will increase at the rate of 2 per cent, which is not bad in any sense
 survey ko sahi maane to pharma sector ne 13 fisadi ke hisaab se selary badhegi, jabaki telecom sector main tankhwaah badhane kii dar 11
 3% per cent
 11 fisadi badhotaree ke saath emmemasiji sectors bhi zyada peeche nahin rahegaa
 But if you are working in the retail, IT and banking sectors, then first save your job
 pichley saal ausatan 13 fisadi selary hike hui thi
 From this perspective, 8
 2 fisadi kii hike kam lagati he
 But given the current state of the economy and the situation in other countries, India is still in a much better position
 survey ye bhi bataata he ki america main ausatan tankhwah sirf 3 fisadi or japan main 2 fisadi badhegi
 It is to be seen that India is ahead of China in terms of increase in salary

 (shailendra Jha is the output head in Aaj Tak news channel
 ) Turkey invades Syria as American troops return
 Turkey's large number of SDF fighters killed in Turkish attack Defending the decision that the US could not engage in stupid endless wars 7000 miles away
 pichley hafte turki ne syria par hamalaa kar diya tha jisamen badi sankhya main log hataahat hue hai or hajaaron logon ko vahaan se palaayan karnaa padaa he
 Last week, Turkey launched a cross-border war into Syria in Kurdish-occupied areas ruled by the Syrian Dremocratic Forces (SDF) led by the Kurdish people
 turki syrian dremocratic forces ko sabase bada aatanki sanghathan maanata he
 'no need to fight endless battles' Many lawmakers have criticized this move to remove Kurdish forces, which are important allies of the US in the fight against ISIS
 turki kaa yah hamalaa pichley hafte america raashtrapati donald trump ke kshetra se america sainikon ko waapas bulaane ke faisle ke baad kiye gaye
 Many people were also killed in this attack
 donald trump ne kaha, ' ham is aadhaar par vahaan se nikle ki ham apane mahaan sainikon ko waapas ghar laane ja rahe hai jo vahaan hai
 We have no need to fight these endless wars
 ham unhen ghar waapas laa rahe hai
 'at the same time, the US President hoped that Turkey and Syria would work for peace in the region
 syria main kitne america sainik?raashtrapati trump ne kaha ki syria par turki hamalaa unke liye koi chaunkaane vaala nahin rahaa, turki iske liye lambey samay se yojana bana rahaa tha
 On the return of American troops, Trump said that most of our troops had returned
 hamaare khyaal se 28 sainik vahaan par hai, lekin 50 se kam hi hai
 Which is a very small army
 unhone aage kaha, 'maine apane sainikon kii vaapasi ke liye abhiyaan chalaaya tha, or yahi kaaran he ki iske liye prayasarat hum
 Preparation for Stricter Sanctions Earlier, US President Donald Trump also said that the US plans to impose tougher sanctions on Turkey after the US forces return from Syria to attack Turkey
 donald trump ne is sambandh main apane ection kii shuruyaat bhi kar di he or turki ke liye steel tarriff main badhotaree kar di he
 Also announced the end of the US $ 100 million deal
 turki dwaara syria ke kurd bahul ilaakon main hamalaa kiye ek saptaah se zyada kaa vakt guzar chukaa he
 In this attack 154 fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been killed
 syria main 69 nagarikon kii bhi maut hui he
 According to Turkey, 6 of its soldiers have been killed in this attack, while 20 of its civilians have also died in retaliation for Kurds
 2015 se esadf kaa niyantranjankaron kaa kahana he ki america sainikon kii syria se vaapasi se turki ko hamalaa karne ke liye green signal mil gaya
 As a result of the civil war that began in 2011, most of the territories were out of the control of the Syrian government and have been controlled by the SDF since 2015
 esadf islamic state (aies) samooh ke khilaaf ladaai main america kaa pramukh sahyogi rahaa he lekin turki esadf ke kurd ladaakon ko 'aatankwaadi' maanata he jo turki virdohi vidroh kaa samarthan karte hai
 Turkey defended its move by calling for a 'safe zone' free of Kurdish fighters, which could also provide refuge to Syrian refugees
 hamale ke baad turki raashtrapati erdogan ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki ham ise nahin rokenge chaahe koi kuch bhi kahe
 Turkey declined the offer to negotiate, before Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan turned down his US counterpart Donald Trump's offer for a cease-fire with the Nigerian Kurdish fighters, although agreeing to continue negotiations with Washington

 deepika ne is aid main apni 'selfi' ke jariye ye bataaya ki unhone kis tarah apni dost kii shaadi ke liye sirf do hafton main apana vajan ghataya
 Usually, Deepika does not share her personal photos with fans, but this time Deepika seems to be changing a bit
 calogs ke is 32 second ke vigyaapan main deepika lagaataar apni 'selfi' khinchati najar aa rahi hai
 In this ad, Deepika is trying to lose weight for her friend's wedding and finally she succeeds in it
 vaise to deepika ko vajan kam karne kii koi jarurat nahin he lekin brand andorsement ke liye nae nae tareeke apnaanaa bhi behad jaruri he
 It is reported that Deepika herself worked with the creative team on the story line of this ed
 is aid ko deepika ke phens kaaphi pasand bhi kar rahe hai
 Now Deepika's fans are requesting that they should share selfie on social networking websites as well
 kaale dhan ke bare main tathy bhale bahut zyada uplabdh na hon lekin iske bare main har kisi kii koi-na-koi raay jarur he
 The opinion of most people is that there is a huge amount of black money
 jo log media main kaam karte hai, unke paas safed dhan he
 Therefore, there is a strong possibility that they will accept this opinion
 par tark kii buniyaad par yah raay kahaan tikti he?kaale dhan kii paaramparik paribhaasha kahati he ki yah vah aamadani he jis par tex adaa nahin kiya gaya he
 If it is spent on consumption goods, it will be lost in the air forever
 kaale dhan kii khoj or pahchaan tabhi kii ja sakati he jab use kisi sthaayee yaa tikaoo sampatti main lagaaya jaae
 People who make a lot of money are not stupid; They will make partial payments from white money, so that the property becomes statutory
 iskaa matlab he ki kaale dhan ke zyaadaatar maamalon main keemat kam bataai jaati he
 Cash transactions were common in the stock markets before electronic transactions
 aajkal vittiya parisampattiyon main nakad len-dein karnaa dheron pareshaaniyon ko daavat dena he
 So there is a possibility that a large part of black money in India is invested in real estate deals
 aam taur par korporate companiyaan or amir karadaata real estate ke liye bhi safed dhan se hi bhugtan karnaa pasand karte hai; or builder bhi nai sampatti ke liye check se bhugtan lene ko saharsha taiyaar ho jate hai, kyonki unhen bhi kai kharch safed dhan se karne hote hai
 It is likely that most of the black money is used in the subsequent purchase and sale of property
 sarkaar ko jidipi kaa aadha fisadi sampatti kar se miltaa he
 This is quite low — an average of 1 in BRIC countries
 2 fisadi or ji20 deshon main 1
 9 percent
 aisa isliye nahin he ki bharat main sampatti kii keemten kam hai, yaa sampatti kar zyada hai
 Indians also do a lot of buying and selling of property — it is their most preferred sustainable capital
 lihaaja sampatti kii keemat kam bataanaa aam baat he
 Actually we can say that lowering the value of your property is the most common method of black money in India
 yah itnaa aam he ki ise lekar kisi ko gussa nahin aata
 They get angry at the black money held abroad because it is considered as the exclusive right of a very small section of the very rich people
 kaale dhan ke bare main kai anumaan lagaae gaye hai
 The first attempt was made in the World Bank's World Development Report in 1985
 har desh kii apni mudra he
 Hence there are as many possibilities of exchange between currencies as there are pairs of currency
 kai dashakon se sarkarein bhugtan santulan ko lekar chintit rahaa karti hai, jo ki aise len-dein ke lekhe-jokhon kaa saar hota he
 That is why they keep reserves of gold or foreign currencies so that they can tilt the balance of payments in their favor when needed
 kuch audyogic desh ab aisa nahin karte, lekin bhugtan santulan ke aankadon kaa hisaab-kitaab ve ab bhi rakhte hai
 However, these figures never work for balance
 bhugtan santulan ke sabhi aankadon main ek avshesh pravishti hoti he, jise bhul-chook kaha jaataa he
 The early flag bearers of black money had assumed that black money comes from this mistake and omission
 deshon kii karency peyar ke aankade kabhi ek samaan nahin hote
 For example, Baltistan has a difference between imports from India and exports from India to Baltistan
 kaale dhan ke duusare jhdabardaaron ne maan liya ki yah fark (desh ke bheetar aane vaali malbhaade or beemaa sareekhee laagton kaa samaayojan karne ke baad) bilon main her-pher kii vajah se hota he or isliye yah kaale dhan kaa janak he
 Economists have no answer in competition and fundamental methods
 lihaaja dusron ne anumaan lagane kii nai takneekein ijad kar leen
 For example, if the rates of interest within the country are low on investments made outside the country, then it is assumed that there must be some hidden interest abroad
 yah kahana meri naadaani hogi ki koi bhi chori-chhipe videshon main paisa nahin bhejtaa
 As long as the government continues to collect import duty on gold, gold smuggling will remain a very profitable business
 1980 ke dashak main daaud ibrahim and company ne taskari ke jo raste banaae the, ve udhyamiyon ke liye aaj bhi khule hai
 But leave aside the smuggling of gold, i do not see any reason why the rich Hindustani would like to take the help of Hawala
 ek amir aadmi apni dhan-daulat ko aparyaapt puunjigat laabhon main rakhkar tamaam tarah ke tex se batch saktaa he
 And even if he gets capital gains , he has to pay only 10%
 apana dhan videshon main le jane ke sidhe-sade or jaij tareeke hai
 The Reserve Bank of India allows us to keep $ 1,25,000 abroad every year without asking any questions
 vah hamen videsh main nivesh karne detaa he; hamen bas is bare main apane bank ko bataanaa hota he
 If this is not enough, one can do whatever he wants abroad, provided he does not live in India more than 182 days in a financial year
 agar kisi ko 'saamanyat: nivasee nahin' kii tarah rahanaa pasand na ho, to seemaa paar bahuterey desh hai jo amir hindustani ko nivas kii anumati yaa rashtriyata de denge
 So there is no need to resort to black money
 lekin kisi kii soch par kiskaa vash he
 If one wants to believe that billions of trillion rupees
 chhipaakar videshon main rakhe gaye hai, to vah apana manmarjee kaa aankada chunane ke liye swatantra he

 00 AM: Aaj Tak the most trusted news channel in the country
 brands trust report main phir bana number van, pichley saal ke mukaable pradarshan or behatar
 The Congress is not known for introspection
 uski bajaae vah gutbandi kii aisi prakriya ko tarjeeh detii he, jo har taraf chatukaarita ke jariye ekta kii shakl ikhtiyaar kar leti he
 And in such a situation, only Mother Goddess Sonia can talk about wisdom
 jab ve hastkshep karti hai, to congress use sunne or unki baton par amal ke liye baadhya ho jaati he
 When she writes a new screenplay, the peoples of the party accept the peeping doubts and ambiguity from it as an expression of the internal struggle of the Congress
 in sab ke baavjood jaipur main sonia gandhi ke bhaashan par gaur karen, usamen ek sammanit sanstha kii jhalak milti he-ek aisi party jo vaaki raashtra nirmaan main juty rahi or uske baad gathbandhan ke vajood main dhal gai
 Years ago, prominent political scientist Rajni Kothari called the Congress a subtle India
 congress ne na keval desh ko disha di, balki loktantric raajnneeti kii bhashaa or uski upamaayen bhi tay kin
 We cannot expect Sonia to unambiguously reveal the truth like Kothari, but the Congress President's speech gives a glimpse of the future scale on which the party will try to understand itself
 sonia aaj jis raah kii ore ishaara kar rahi hai, sambhavat: party kal usee par chalegi
 What is Sonia's attitude towards the general public with respect to the Congress? One thing is very clear
 congress aaj bhi vanshavaadi loktantr kii raah par chal rahi he
 If Sonia has power today, Rahul will rule tomorrow
 phir bhi sonia ke bhaashan main dilchaspee kii khaasi gunjaaish he
 First, a change in the party's ideology
 spasht rup se ishaara is ore rahaa ki jo kuch bhi kal congress ke liye sabase acha tha, aane vaale samay main vah vaise hi nahin rahane vaala
 For example, Sonia believed that the mismatch around MNREGA was breaking
 gramin ilaakon main beshak yah kaamyaab rahaa, lekin isane party ke shahari votaron main koi ijapha nahin kiya
 Pragmatism has made Sonia Gandhi realize that the time has come to focus more on skilled employment so that the Congress has a reputation as a party to create a better environment for investment
 desh ke kuch bhaagon main congress kii maujuudagi na ke baraabar he
 In such areas, the entire generation grew up without seeing the good or bad rule of the Congress
 iskaa behtareen udhaaharan gujarat he jahaan congress lagbhag do dashak se satta se baahar he
 Apart from this, it is also a matter of concern for the Congress that there is a dent in its traditional stronghold like Andhra Pradesh
 congress sikud rahi he or jaisaa ki jairam ramesh ne safagoi se kaha, congress ke liye apane boote satta main aane kii sambhaavna ab dur kii kaudi ho gai he
 During the party's ritual introspection, there is a special focus on three social classes - first, the middle class which the Congress wants to make its electoral base, as well as giving importance to youth and women to give a new relevance to their campaign
 congress kaa maananaa he ki mahilaayein samasya nahin, balki uski kendriya shakti hai
 The list of party members should reflect the broad social imagination of the Congress and introduce women and their issues from the block to the national level, adding that these issues should be addressed to the responsibility of Mahila Congress or related women's organizations
 Can not be left out
 sonia ne purush pradhan party kii vichaardhaara main buniyadi badlaav kii baat uthaai he
 They clearly believe that issues related to women are important for a society, so they should be important for the Congress as a political party
 chintan shivi aatmvishleshan tha jo congress ko naagarikta kaa paath padhaane ke liye kiya gaya
 It was divided into various segments of foreign policy, organization issues, women empowerment and political challenges
 phir bhi andeh, nae vichaar, innovative raajnneeti ke liye khaas gunjaaish nahin thi
 It is as if there is a book speech on the use of tips instead of discussing the strategy
 bhaashan chaahe sonia gandhi kaa ho, pradhanmantri yaa kamalnath kaa, aisa maaloom ho rahaa tha ki sab kuch pehle se janaa hua he, maano koi purana casette chal rahaa ho jisamen samayik or praasangik ke bich antar karnaa mushkil ho
 Sonia's speech showed signs of real crisis in Congress
 sankat ke prati kisi kii pratikriya lubhaavne andaaj main nahin hoti
 Chintan Shivar lacked deep analysis, organizational philosophy and change in organization
 sonia congress college kii professor kii bhoomika or rahul samarpit tutor kaa kirdaar nibhaate dikhe, jo sabhi praasangik khandon main jaakar apana kaam kar rahe the
 Congress only has to repeat the same stereotypes
 aatmamanthan karne vaali party ke paas aatma, aitihaasik or naitik yaaddaasht hona chahie taaki use ehsaas ho sake ki vah kya se kya ho gai he
 What looks like is the desperation to get power without the courage to face the responsibilities
 congress achaanak ek shaleen party dikh rahi he jise bahut saare maamalon main shaleenta baratani hogi
 The author is a well-known sociologist and has taught in many universities
 dilli main jin skulon ko didie ne jameen di he unke maidaanon ko chuttee ke baad aasapaas ke bacchon ke liye kholane kii taiyaari ho gai he

 shahari vikaas mantralay is silsile main jaldi hi ek notification jari karne vaala he
 The grounds of the schools to which the DDA has given land at concessional rates should be opened to the surrounding children after the end of school

 vah sansad par hamale kaa teesraa din tha
 In the afternoon, i came to know from my source of Special Cell of Delhi Police that a Kashmiri named Afzal Guru has been arrested from Srinagar bus stand in connection with the attack and he is being brought to Delhi by plane
 afjal usee raat dilli aayaa
 The next day was Sunday
 main subah se hi ek baar phir special cell ke daftar ke baahar ja kar khadaa ho gaya
 i was constantly in touch with ACP Rajbir, DCP Ashok Chand and Commissioner Ajayraj Sharma on the phone
 dopaher ko hamen bataaya gaya ki afjal or uske saath hiraasat main liye gaye uske baaki teen saathiyon ke vijual hamen shoot karne die jaaenge
 After some time Afzal and his companions were in front of us for the first time
 teenon ke haathon me hathkadiscaan thim
 The trio were probably facing the camera for the first time
 main intervyuu ke liye lagaataar koshish kar rahaa tha
 On December 19, ACP Rajbir suddenly told me don't worry, you will get an interview
 khud grih mantri laalkrishna adwani chaahate hai ki sansad hamale ke aaropee kaa sach puraa desh jane
 DCP Ashok Chand also said that once the order comes from above, the interview will be done

 Around 1 pm ACP Rajbir called in his office on the first floor with a camera

 Rajbir was sitting in his chair in the office
 saamne mujhe bithaaya or phir bataaya ki afjal guru isi kamare main aane vaala he, apana camera set kar lo
 i asked the other three? Rajbir said that the man is Afzal, so only he will speak
 rajbir ne kaha main bhi kamare main hi rahoonga or jo sawaal yaa jawaab thik nahin lagegaa, use baad main hataa dena
 i agreed iske baad dopaher kareeb dedh baje special cell ke jawan afjal ko lekar aae or use mere saamne vaali kursi par bithaaya gaya
 Afzal's hair was neatly adorned, the shave was probably done shortly before
 aisa lagata tha maano use nahala-dhulaa kar laayaa gaya he
 Rajbir was sitting right behind me in such a way that his eyes were directly on Afzal
 afjal mere saamne baitha tha par vah baar-baar rajbir kii taraf dekhtaa tha

 e
 R
 gilaani ke bare main poocha ki sansad hamale main unka kya role tha? usee vakt rajbir ke paas kisi kaa phone aayaa tha, isliye vah meraa sawaal nahin sun sakaa
 But after keeping the phone, the answer was heard
 iske baad achaanak rajbir ne ishaara kar intervyuu khatm karne ko kaha
 After this as soon as our camera went off, he scolded Afzal for why he was talking about Geelani
 iske baad us asipi ne mujhase kaha ki maine apana vaada nibhaayaa
 it's your turn now
 plis, gilaani vaali line intervyuu se hataa dena
 Rajbir used to give news to all of us
 main us sorce ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chahta tha
 So that evening when this interview was telecast on Aaj Tak, i removed those lines
 mujhe us vaktatak sachmuch yah ehsaas nahin tha ki is line kii koi ahmiyat bhi ho sakati he
 But after the completion of six months of the Parliament attack, Aaj Tak re-conducted the same interview of Afzal
 tab tak main bhul chukaa tha ki gilaani kii line hataani he
 Then the full interview of Afzal went on, with Afzal saying that Gilani had no knowledge about the attack on Parliament and that he was innocent
