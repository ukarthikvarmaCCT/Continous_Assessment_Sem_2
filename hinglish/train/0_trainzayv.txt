 'good news' ke trailor launch ke dauraan media se baatcheet karte hue akshay kumaar ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya
 Akshay Kumar explained this in detail, saying, "when the big people don't take you to the film, then you have to start your own journey
 agar aapako bade santhaan main kaam nahin miltaa he to aapako chote ke saath janaa hi padataa he
 From there you can jump
 aap keval ghar baithkar yah nahin soch sakate ki itnaa kaabil hone ke baad bhi log aapako filmon main kyon nahin le rahe hai

 " team india ko series ke aakiri T-20 match main zimbabwe ne 10 ranon se haraa diya
 This was the first time Zimbabwe had beaten India in a T20 match
 haar kii vajah ballebaaz rahe jo 146 ke lakshya ko bhi hasil nahin kar sake
 In fact, there has been a lack of Indian batting throughout this tour
 3 vanade match kii series main bharat ne 300 kaa aankada ek baar bhi nahin chuaa,vahiin 3 vanade match kii series main bharat kaa sarvocch score rahaa 276 ran kaa
 In the series of two T-20 matches, Team India could not put the figure of 200 and Team India's highest score in T-20 was 178 runs
 is ausat pradarshan ke baad bhi captain aginky rahane ye maanane ko taiyaar nahin ki khilaadiyon main josh kii kami dikhi
 Ajinkay says "there was no lack of enthusiasm among the players, i am satisfied with the way we played cricket on the whole tour
 lekin haa, aakhri tii-20 main mili haar ne hamen thodaa niraash zarur kiya he
 "the batsmen's personal performance also does not set high expectations
 ambati to khayr chotil ho gaye, lekin duusare khilaadi jo chale bhi wo ek acchhee pari hi khel paae
 In the ODI series, Kedar Jadhav, Stuart Binny and Murali Vijay played 1–1 innings, but in the T-20 series, all three could not score a single half-century
 tippaniyan Manoj Tiwary flopped in odis, dropping from playing 11 in T20
 robin uthppa vanade main flop rahe, aakiri tii-20 main unhone 42 ran banaae
 In the last ODI, Manish also failed to impress in T20
 gendbaazi main sandip sharma ko chhodkar baaki sabhi gendbaazon ne thik-thik pradarshan kiya
 However Rahane blames the opponent's strength more than his weakness for this performance
 rahane ke mutabik "hamen zimbabwe ko acchhee cricket khelnaa kaa shrey dena chahie
 He has played well throughout the series
 hamane aakhri tii-20 main bahut jaldi 4 wicket ganvaa die jiske kaaran hamen haar mili
 The bowlers did a good job but the batsmen missed the last match
 " bench strength yaa yuva team jo bhi ise naam diya jaae, aisa kuch nahin kar saki jisapar jashn manaaya ja sake
 
 chayankartaaon ke liye ye chetavanee he, unhen ab in reserve khilaadiyon se aage bhi sochna hoga taaki bhavishya kii team india behatar dhang se taiyaar kii ja sake
 Even after this average performance, captain Ajinkya Rahane is not ready to believe that there is a lack of enthusiasm among the players
 aginky kaa kahana he "khilaadiyon main josh kii kami nahin thi, puure daure par jis tareeke kii cricket hamane kheli usase main santusht hum
 But yes, the defeat in the last T20 has definitely disappointed us
 " ballebaazon kaa nijee pradarshan bhi bahut zyada ummiden nahin baandhta he
 Ambati was injured, but the other players, who went on, could play a good innings
 vanade series main kedaar jadhav, stfort binni or murali vijay ne 1-1 acchhee pari kheli lekin T-20 series main ye teenon ek bhi ardhashatak nahin laga paae
 The comments manoj tiwari vanade main flop rahe, tii-20 main unhen plaing 11 se drop kiya gaya
 Robin Uthappa flopped in odis, scoring 42 runs in the last T20
 aakiri vanade main chamake manish bhi tii-20 main prabhavit nahin kar paae
 Except bowling Sandeep Sharma, all the bowlers performed well
 haalaaki rahane is pradarshan ke liye apni kamazori se zyada virdohi kii takat ko zimmedaar maanate hai
 According to Rahane "we should give credit to Zimbabwe for playing good cricket
" puri series main wo acha khele hai
 We lost 4 wickets very early in the last T20 due to which we lost
 gendbaazon ne acha kaam kiya magar ballebaaz aakhri match main chook gaye
 "the bench strength or the young team, whatever it is named, could not do anything that could be celebrated
 
 This is a warning for the selectors, now they have to think ahead of these reserve players so that future Team India can be better prepared

 What do you think about it who is older? Salman Khan or Amitabh Bachchan? When we release films, we keep time gap because tickets are expensive
 lekin tivi par to aap hamen muft main dekhte hai or sabhi sho kaa saath-saath majaa le sakate hai
 So what is the point of comparison? Bachchan sahab has his own special role, which he started last year
 or ab meri apni style he
 What does Dabangg's success mean to you? The film could have done anything
 nahin chalati to log kehete sattar vaali cheez ab nahin chalati
 Have you become more serious about your work? Previously i used to do films knowing that they were bad because i had to buy a house or film my friends or make atonement that the previous film was bad
 ab itane barason tak industry main rahane ke baad main sikh gaya hum ki kya karnaa he or kya nahin karnaa he
 So will you stop taking interest in the middle of the film? No, i will just do what the director says and put 150 percent (laughs)
 kya aapane galatiyon se sikh lee he?galati koi jaanboojhkar nahin kii jaati
 If you learn, it means that you are progressing
 meri galatiyon ne mujhe majboot banaaya he, unhone jivan or rishton ke mulya sikhaye hai
 Do you like the general perception of people about you? It is that some people consider me completely useless, some people kill me
 to aap asal main kya hai?yah mere saamne vaale par nirbhar he
 i respond according to the incident
 main shikaayat nahin paalataa
 Even if this happens, it is only for a moment
 vaise, main apane daayre main bahut acha hum
 Is there anything other than movies? i can do a lot
 painting kar saktaa hum, kheti kar saktaa hum, bachche paal saktaa hum
 So are you ready to get married? No, not ready yet
 aisi koi ichha nahin ho rahi
 Nevertheless, whenever i remained connected with someone i always wished to get married
 lekin pahal nahin kar paata tha
 With whom did you join? You must have known them all
 unka naam lene kii kya jarurat he? har koi khush he, shaadishuda he
 Not everyone? Yes, Somi (ali) No
 or katrina
 
 
 
 katrina abhi shaadi ke liye choti he
 And are you still afraid of your father? No, that's respect
 aaj bhi jab ve mujhe phone karte hai, khadaa ho jaataa hum
 i cannot speak two lines properly in front of them
 abhi bhi main hakalane lagata hum, bich main bhul jaataa hum
 But they are very cute
 ham kai baar party karte hai, saath-saath pite hai lekin tabhi jab ham masti kar rahe hote hai

 times ke sampadak ‘time person of da year’ kaa chunaav karenge or 10 disambar ko isaki ghoshnaa karenge
 The Times has been conducting such surveys since 1927 regarding the selection of 'person of the Year'
 lakshmi sahagal1914-2012saahsee swatantraaa sangram senaanee, janata kii doctor, stri adhikaron kii champion or communist krantikari lakshmi sahagal kaa 23 july ko 98 varsh kii aayu main nidhan ho gaya
 Captain Lakshmi Sehgal's daughters Subhashini and Anisa fulfilled their last wish by donating them to the body college to further their medical knowledge in front of a crowd that came to see them on the lawn of Kanpur Medical College on that rainy day in Kanpur
 college ke praachaarya ne ise abhootpurv daan bataate hue iske liye apni gahari kritagyata vyakt kii
 It was a question in the minds of some people who attended the funerals in the emotional atmosphere, why no central or state government representative is present to pay tribute to this extraordinary woman
 lekin khud lakshmi ne dilli darbar ke is abhadra vyavhaar par bas yun hi apane kandhe uchakaa die hote
 India's last great female freedom fighter was a staunch opponent of the politics of protection and self-sufficiency, which she believed that this style of politics had become the hallmark of power in independent India
 yah kaha ja saktaa he ki in sattaaon se unki yah duuri or bharat ke logon se unke sukhon or dukhon, unke rosemara ke sangharshon se najdiki unki antim yatra main pratibimbit ho rahi thi- pehle kii anupasthiti or duusare kii baari upasthiti
 In those historical events, when she led Netaji's Jhansi Rani Regiment and fought the British Army, she lacked any personal ambition for her role, and her poignant humility was one of her most extraordinary features
 isse unke dwaara kiya gaya ek or moolbhoot chunaav parilakshith hota he or vah he garibon kii seva main apni jindagi bitaane kaa nirnay
 This was not an approach based on 'charity' in any way
 yah duniya ko dekhne kaa ek atyant rajnatik tarika tha
 He believed deeply that India's freedom cannot be protected until the poor of India are freed from a life of exploitation and poverty and they are not even heard of in running the country
 '70 ke dashak main ve marxvaadi communist party main shaamil hui thim or ol india democratic voomons association kii ve sansthaapak netaa thim
 She was also active in trade unions
 yah bhi ghar ke bheetar nirnay karne kii swatantraaa kaa ek drushtaant hi he ki unke pati prem sahagal jo iene main unke saathi senaanee or ek rashtriya nayak hone ke saath-saath 1947 ke ku khyath lalakila mukademe ke aaropee bhi the, us mil ke prabandhan kaa ek hissaa the jiske baahar unki patni lakshmi or beti subhashini haathon main laal jhanda uthaae dharna detii thim
 She never returned anyone from her simple clinic in Kanpur, scolded, cuddled, gave advice and in the process got the surname of mother from even older men and women
 yahaan garibon ke ilaaj ke liye unhone khud ko samarpit kar diya
 In fact, he played the role of a social reformer struggling to eliminate superstitions and meaningless customs from the lives of those he came into contact with
 striyon ke swasthya kii raksha ke liye parivaar niyojan main unka drudh vishwaas tha or ham us vakt aksar hansate-hansate doharaa ho uthte the jab ve hamaare saamne un pasandida jumalon ko duharaati thim jinhen ve 'gairjimmedaar mardon' ke liye apane bhaashanon main istemaal karti thim
 She hated the caste system and speaking out against it was very passionate
 ve hameshaa antarjaateey vivaah ko protsaahan detii thim or unamem shaamil hone ke liye hameshaa tatpar rahati thim
 When faced with dishonesty or bad politics, he never lacked words
 isaki ek sansanikhej misaal he ki kaise bombai kii ek smriti sabha main jab ek pratyakshtah sampradayik rajnatik dal ke netaa ne unke pair chune chaahe to unhone apane pairon ko peeche khinch liya or kaha ki nahin rahane dijie
 Go first and wipe the blood with your hands
 san 1992 ke raashtrapati chunaav main ve vam or ku chha samarthak dalon kii pratyaashee thim
 It was not her loss when she lost
 nuksaan main bharat tha jisane aisi damakham vaali mahila, ek preranadayak insaan, siddhantvaadi tathaa sachharitra shaks ko apane pratham naagarik ke rup main paane kaa avasar gavaan diya tha
 His life is part of the struggle of the Indian people for justice
 ve hameshaa amar rahengi
 Brinda Karat is a CPI (M) MP in Rajya Sabha supreme court ne centre or rajya sarkaron se kaha he ki vah lalabatti vaali gadiyon kii taadaad main kami laaen taaki aam log aazaadee se sadak par aa ja saken
 During the hearing of a case, the Supreme Court said that nowadays red light carriage has become a means of showing false pride
 supreme court ne sarkaron se is silsile main kanoon badalane ke liye kaha he or kaha he ki yah unke liye aakhri mauka he

 In Karnataka, bjp's BS Yeddyurappa became the chief minister on the strength of 104 mlas despite falling 7 seats short of the magic figure of majority
 lekin shapath lene ke 55 ghante ke baad hi unhen apni kursi chhodani pad gai
 The BJP tried to bring congress-jds mlas into its camp, but they could not succeed
 unki raah main sabase badi baadha purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke samay bana 'dal badal nishedh kanoon' rahaa, jiske chalate yediurppa ko istipha dene ke liye majaboor hona padaa
 Let us tell you that BS Yeddyurappa needed 111 mlas to preserve his power
 jabaki bijepi se 104 vidhayak the
 In such a situation, he needed 7 other mlas
 iske liye congress or jedies se 7 vidhayak naata todakar aate to dalbadal nishedh kanoon ke tahat unki sadsyta radd ho jaati
 This could have happened only if more than half of the mlas had parted ways with the party, then their membership would have remained intact
 bijepi ke liye ye kaam naammumkin tha
 The credit for the introduction of the 'dalit Prohibition Law' goes to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
 1967 se1983 ke bich dal-badal kaa khel jamkar khelaa gaya
 While the socialist leaders broke away from the Congress, the Congress took advantage of it in many states and formed its government
 1966 main punjab se alag haryana nayaa rajya bana
 Elections were held a year later in 1967
 rajya ke 81 siton main se congress ko 48, jansangh ko 12 or 16 vidhayak nirdaleey chune gaye
 Apart from this, 3 mlas of Swatantra Party and 2 mlas of Republican Army of India won
 congress ne bhagwati dayaal sharmaako siem pad kii kursi saunpi gai, lekin jald hi party ke bheetar foot pad gai
 Rao Birender Singh of Southern Haryana revolted in the Congress
 wo congress ke 37 vidhayak lekar party se alag ho gaye
 The Swatantra Party formed the government with the support of the Jana Sangh and 16 independent mlas
 or yaheen se shuru hua dal-badal kaa khel
 In this assembly which lasted eight months, 44 mlas changed their loyalty
 ek sadsy ne paanch baar, do sadasyon ne chaar baar party badali
 Three mlas changed their positions three times, four mlas twice and 34 mlas 1 time
 1967 main palaval kii hasanpur seat se vidhayak bane gaya laal ne 9 ghante main teen baar party badali
 It was used extensively to maintain power in Haryana politics
 yaheen ye 'aayaa ram, gaya ram' muhaavara ban gaya
 Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi broke the Congress into a separate party in 1969 with 197 mps
 is vivaad ke chalate 1973 main indira gandhi vidhaan sanshodhan vidheyak pesh kiya tha
 Two years later, an emergency was imposed
 1980 ke daur main dal-badal kaa chalan itnaa zyada bad gaya ki sansad ko '52waan samvidhan sanshodhan act' ke jariye samvidhan main 10veen anusuchee jodna padaa
 However, the Congress took advantage of most of the defection
 indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad disambar1984 main loksabhaa chunaav hue congress apane nae navele netaa rajeev gandhi ke saath maidan main utari
 He promised to bring a party-changing law in the election
 congress satta main ai 8 saptaah ke andar hi tatkaleenpradhanmantri rajeev gandhi 1985 main dalbadal ke rog ko samaapt karne ke liye dal badal virdohi kanoon sansad se donon sadan se paarit karaayaa
 The biggest weakness or discrepancy in this law was that defection was banned at the individual level but legal recognition was given for doing so in bulk
 darasal us samay 11 rajyon main chunaav hone the aise main kaha gaya tha ki rajeev gandhi apni chhavi ko behatar banane ke liye unhone ye kadam uthaaya tha
 In 2003, the NDA regime, headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, decided that not just one person, if the party was changed collectively, it would also be declared unconstitutional

 kashmiramen pichley do hafte se bade maamalon or andeshon ke alaava ghatnaon or sandarbhon kaa dabadabaa bana hua he
 It is important for us to understand this so that the seriousness of the danger hanging over nuclear-powered South Asia can be understood
 taaja ghatana he teen kashmiri yuvakon kii maut
 All three young men were killed at the hands of the security forces
 isse paidaa hui sthitiyaan itani sangeen thim ki jammu-kashmir sarkaar ko bhartiya sena ke ek bade adhikari ke khilaaf exiar darj karaani padi
 But the officer's father challenged this FIR in the Supreme Court
 unka kahana tha ki aisa koi adhikaar he hi nahin
 This means that the parents of the three slain youths - Javed Bhatt, Suhail Lone and Rais Ganai - are far from being investigated or sentenced; they do not even have the right to record the death of their sons
 sajaa dilaane kii to koi bhi sambhaavna nahin he kyonki sashastr bal visheshadhikaar kanoon (eexspie) ke tahat mukadmaa chalaane ke liye rajya sarkaron ko centre sarkaar kii anumati leni hoti he
 This dilemma in the writ petition exposes the irony of the contradiction inherent in Indian democracy for Kashmir: the elected government of the allegedly "public" cannot represent the people
 iskaa taatkaalik sandarbh yah he ki haal ke varshon main niyantran rekha (elosi) par ausatan 300 baar yudhviram kaa ulanghan hua, pichley chah maheene main pakistan ke ek bhi naagarik ko vija nahin diya gaya he, sainik karravaayiyon, niyantran rekha ke paas rah rahe nagarikon ko dar-badar karne, ang-bhang karne or maut ke ghat utaarne kii ghatnaon main abhootpurv rup se teji ai he
 This was reported by Tapan Bose of the pakistan-india People's Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFPD) in preparation for the 10th meeting in Bhubaneswar earlier this month
 yah dikhaata he ki ek tantra ke rup main sarkaar is baat kii upeksha karti he ki rajkaaj janata ke liye hota he—na ki keval ilaake ke liye, jaisaa ki tathakthith raashtra-rajya kii 500 saal puraani avadharana hamen bataati ai he
 This fusion of speech and context shows South Asia to have contradictions and disturbances in relations between India and Pakistan, the two largest regional and demographic countries
 isse ek bada khatra khadaa ho gaya he jise duniya dekh nahin paa rahi he lekin donon deshon ke naagarik dinon-din is khatre ke prati sachet ho rahe hai
 Then what is the mood in Kashmir? There is not even a small wave of change in strict attitude
 pidipi kii ore se darj exiar ko log sirf dikhaava maan rahe hai or jaanate hai ki party ke liye yah chitt bhi meri, patt bhi meraa vaala daanv he
 The party wants to take advantage of the opportunity of people's displeasure over an incident and on the other hand puts the onus on the coalition partner BJP to neutralize the actual action using the context of AFSPA which is actually martial law
 ghatana or sandarbh kaa yah gaiyr-iradatan sammilan siyaasi rup se najuk kashmir ko yah samajhane kaa mauka detaa he ki kuch maheene pehle centre main bhaajapa kii sarkaar ke ravaie main achaanak narmi kyon aa gai thi, jab usne kashmir ke liye ''vishesh pratinidhi" niyukt kiya tha
 The real problem of the bjp-led central government is that it is unable to control its allies in governance
 yahaan yah gauratlab he ki inkaa chunavi jumala, inke sangh or vistaarit parivaar or niyantran kii jad se baahar hi rahe saajhedaaron ke samarthakon ke aadhaar kii vaastavik aasthaa he
 This can be clearly seen by the stance of the Union Minister of Defense, who first supported the FIR and later changed that "concession"
 iske alaava ek anya sanket televijan par bolne waalon ke mood se bhi miltaa he
 While arguing on Kashmir, they say that there is nothing but war
 kashmir main ise ek saamaanya baat mana ja rahaa he
 It has become normal in Kashmir to assume that this struggle is over until fighting with the state which is responsible for their unemployment, infrastructure, economy and development
 yah nai dilli ke liye zyada chintaa kaa vishay hona chahie
 Siddiq Wahid is a political historian, former patriarch and central commentator on the politics of Kashmir in Central Eurasia and Tibet

 Let me tell you that recently Imran Ansari met Sajjad Lone, President of People's Conference close to BJP, which is being seen as a possible political front in the state

 bajet satr ke duusare din sansad ke donon sadanon main banking ghotaale ke mudde par jabardast hangaamaa hua
 The entire opposition including Congress, TMC, TDP, Shiv Sena created uproar in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on the issue of Nirav Modi
 khaas baat ye rahi ki sarkaar ke samarthak dal bhi hangaame main shaamil rahe
 Due to the uproar, the proceedings of the Lok Sabha were adjourned for the day
 congress chaahati he sthagansansadeey kaarymantri anant kumaar ne loksabhaa main hangaame ke bich kaha ki sarkaar charchaa ke liye taiyaar he or is babat notice bhi diya gaya he, phir bhi charchaa nahin ho paa rahi he
 In fact, the opposition including Congress has demanded that Nirav Modi and the banking scam in Lok Sabha be discussed under Rule 52 while the government is ready for discussion under 193
 congress netaa or purv kanoon mantri virappa moili ne kaha ki modi sarkaar is mudde par charchaa se batch rahi he, vipaksh sthagan prastaav ke tahat charchaa chahta he
 However, the adjournment motion has not been approved by Asan
 sansadeey kaarymantri anant kumaar ne congress par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki loksabhaa spikar ne 193 ke tahat charchaa ko sweekaar kiya he
 It was placed in today's list of business
 pichley kuch varsh main hue banking ghotaalon par charchaa hogi, congress us par charchaa nahin karnaa chaahati
 Attacking the opposition leaders, he said that Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjan Kharge should tell what they want to hide
 anant kumaar ne kaha ki congress ne khud 193 ke tahat notice diya tha
 We want to ask the Congress directly what they want to hide
 congress ko beete varshon ke ghotaalon par charchaa se kyon dikkat he
 According to the rules of Parliament, Rule 193 is a short-term discussion and the Minister concerned responds to it while 52 have a provision for voting after debate
 upie ko gherne kii koshishdrasal sarkaar chaahati he ki pienbi ghotaale ke saath-saath beete varshon main hue bank ghotaalon par bhi charchaa ho
 In such a discussion, the ruling party will get full opportunity to surround the opposition Congress
 beete varshon ke bank ghotaalon par agar charchaa hoti he to bijepi sadan main vijay maalya jaise muddon ko uthaaegi, jabaki vipaksh sirf neerav modi ke mudde par charchaa karmodi sarkaar ko ghernachahta he
 Notice has also been given by the BJP to discuss corruption of former ministers
 is mudde par charchaa ko asana kii ore se abhi manjuur nahin kiya gaya he
 By discussing the issue, BJP wants to target former finance minister p Chidambaram, whose daughter Karthi is accused of money laundering in the INX Media case
 satta paksh or vipaksh kii alag-alag maang he
 Both parties do not want to see themselves on the back foot in the House, which is why they are ready to discuss their own terms by resorting to rules
 aise main hangaamaa donon hi sadanon main jari he or satr kaa doosraa din bhi isi hangaame kii bhent chadh gaya he

 Jacob Watten scored for Australia in the 14th minute while Rupidar Pal Singh scored for India in the 22nd minute
 bhartiya dephence kii vajah se austrailian team ne match main dabadabaa banaaya hua tha
 Because of this, the World Champion team got two penalty corners and the ball kept going to the Australian strikers again and again but d'souza kept the opposing team away from Golmukh with a great game
 bhartiya team ke liye 1-1 kaa score santoshjanak rahaa kyonki saat maheene pehle nayi dilli main hue rashtramandal khelon ke final main unhen austrailia ke haathon 0

 (inputs bhashaa se bhi) (also from the input language) aam aadmi party ne modi sarkaar ko kisaan virdohi bataate hue, chunavi vaadon se mukarne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 AAP leaders say that the recent statement made by the Minister of Agriculture is a deception of the farmers, in which the Modi government promised to give 50 per cent benefit of the cost of the crop but is now retracting
 aam aadmi party ke netaa ashish khetaan ne aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'modi sarkaar main krishi mantri ne radha mohan singh ne ailaania bayaan diya he ki modi sarkaar ab kisaanon se kiye chunavi vaade ke mutabik unki laagat kaa 50 fisadi laabh dene main asamarth he, kyonki aisa karne se open market main badi dikkat paidaa ho jaaegi
 This statement of Modi's minister means that the farmers of the country should no longer have any hope from the Modi government, because the Modi government is more concerned about the profits of the open market companies
 desh kaa kisaan agar karz ke boj se aatmahatya kar rahaa he, to ussemodi sarkaarko koi fark nahin padataa, kyonki is sarkaar ko desh ke kisaan kii chintaa nahin he
 The Aam Aadmi Party also questioned the Modi government by waving the bjp's manifesto
 ashish khetaan ne kaha, 'bhartiya janata party or narendra modi ne apnechunavi ghoshnaptramen yah kaha tha ki wo kisaanon kii sthiti sudhaarney kii disha main kaam karenge or kisaanon ko unki laagat kaa 50 fisadi munaafaa sunishchit karavaaya jayega
 But at this time, the farmer of the country is worried about not paying the loan and not getting the right price for his crop and committing a large number of suicides
 aisi vikat sthiti main modi sarkaar ne desh ke kisaanon ko bhukho marane ke liye chhod diya he
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party's concern for farmers certainly appears political
 aam aadmi party ne elaan kiya he ki wo punjab ke kisaanon ko modi sarkaar is faisle ke bare main bataaegi
 Along with Punjab, the Aam Aadmi Party will launch a massive campaign for the rights of farmers across the country
 ashish khetaan ne kaha ki aam aadmi party kisaanon kii ladaai sadak se lekar sansad tak ladegi or desh kii modi sarkaar par lagaataar yah dabaav banaaegi ki yaa to wo kisaanon ko kiye apane chunavi vaade ko puraa kare or agar nahin kar sakati to pradhanmantri haath jodakar desh ke kisaan se maafi maangen

 The board refused to give a certificate to 'salgato Saal Anamat', saying that if the film is screened in its present form, it could worsen the law and order problem
 sensor board ko film ke samvaad ke saath bhi dikkat he or uskaa maananaa he ki samvaad bharat ke samvidhan nirmaataa dow
 BR is against Ambedkar
 film ko 17 june ko relies kiya janaa tha
 CBFC Office Superintendent KD Kamble, who deals with regional films, said, "the film has been denied a certificate
" ' kamble ne kaha, 'aisa isliye kiya gaya he, kyonki agar iske vartmaan swaroop main ise relies kiya gaya to isse kanoon or vyavastha se judi samasya or bighad sakati he, kyonki film aarakshan andolan ke netaa hardik patel ke jivan par aadhaarit he, jo jail main hai or maamla vichaaradhin he
 The film also has dialogues against Doctor Ambedkar and the reservation policy
 ' nirmaataaon ne ab apana aavedan sibiefasi kii punarikshan samiti ko bheja he or ab ve uski manjuuri kii pratiksha kar rahe hai
 Director Rajesh Gohil said, 'we have recently received a response from the CBFC, in which it has said that the film is based on Hardik Patel and he is in jail and a case against him due to law and order problem
 Its going on
 ' He also said, 'our film is not based on the life of Hardik Patel
 ham logon kii film patidaar aarakshan andolan par aadhaarit he, hardik patel par nahin
 We have said this
 ' film main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale mobin khan ne kaha, 'aisa prathit hota he ki sensor board ko gujarati bhashaa kii bhi bahut kam jaankaree he, kyonki usne kaha he ki film main bole gaye samvaad baba sahab ambedkar ke khilaaf he, lekin baat aisi nahin he
 If heard properly, he is mentioned only once, when a character says that Ambedkar made reservation in Indian Constitution
 ' nirmaataaon ne kaha ki pichley varsh ahmedabad ke jiemdisi maidan main patidaar andolan ke shuru hone ke ek maah ke bheetar hi unhone film nirmaan shuru kar diya tha or do maah pehle pramann ke liye ise sensor board ko bheja tha

 Voting is scheduled to take place in Karnataka on May 12 on 224 assembly seats in Karnataka
 maton kii gananaa 15 may ko hogi
 The main contest in this election is between Congress, BJP and JDS
 karnataka main congress sabase badi partikarnataka chunaavako lekar india today-karvi incits ke opinian pole ke mutabik congress karnataka main sabase badi party ke taur par ubhar kar saamne aa rahi he, lekin bahumat ke aankade se wo darjan bhar siton se peeche rah jaaegi
 At the same time, BJP is likely to be second with 78–86 seats
 jabaki devgauda kii jedies rajya main kingmekar kii bhoomika main saamne aa sakati he
 Kiran Bedi, the country's first female IPS officer, finally jumped into Delhi's riot
 kiran bedi ne bijepi jwine kar lee he or vah dilli vidhansabha kaa chunaav bhi ladengi ye bhi tay ho gaya he, lekin kahaan se ye tay nahin he or isko lekar bhi atakalein lag rahi hai ki kya kiran bedi dilli main bijepi kaa siem cheharaa ho sakati hai? or kya kejariwal kaa jawaab dilli main bijepi ke liye kiran bedi hi hai? Former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and BJP leader Kiran Bedi started the most important movement of their life with "lokpal Movement" and both became very famous as an important member of Team Anna, but in 2011 Lokpal movement started After a year and a half, when a social movement moved from a political party, Kiran Bedi refused to join politics with Kejriwal
 aaj dekhie kiran bedi raajnneeti main ai bhi to saamana arvind kejariwal se ho rahaa he
 However, Kiran Bedi joining BJP is not a surprise
 kiran bedi lokapal andolan ke samay se bijepi ke kaafii qareeb dikhti thi or jab unhone kejariwal ke saath raajnneeti main jane se manaa kiya, tab bhi yahi mana gaya ki wo bijepi ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaana chaahati isliye kejariwal ke saath raajnneeti main nahin gai
 She was highly praised to Narendra Modi as PM candidate, but she also kept saying that she would remain apolitical
 may 2014 main jab bijepi ne desh jeeta uske baad se kiran bedi ke siem ummidavaari charchaa main aa gai thi, lekin samay ke saath lagane laga ki shaayad bijepi baahar se laakar kisi ko siem candidet nahin banaaegi
 As soon as the news of Kiran Bedi joining BJP came in the discussion, her old tweets also came up as if her tweet of 16 March 2013, "one day Narendra Modi will have to clean up the Gujarat riots, despite the fact that the courts still give him a clean chit Giving yaa phir 5 sitambar 2013 kaa unka ye twit ''agar raajnneetik partiyaan artiai ke daayre main na aae do desh ko unako milane vaali tex main chhot waapas le leni chahie saath hi bangala or zamin bhi vaapis liye jane chahie'' Narendra Modi has become PM today and BJP is still refusing to come under the purview of RTI
 kya is tarah ke vichaar kiran bedi kaa peechha chodenge? Before i go ahead, let me tell you that when i went to the office of the Aam Aadmi Party today, during my meeting with its top leaders, it came to know that Kiran Bedi was the cause of her concern and she had a streak of worry on her forehead
 It happened, but when asked, the leaders were saying that 'it doesn't matter'
 iske baad, main dilli bijepi ke daftar gaya ye sochakar ki yahaan to jashn hoga, lekin dilli bijepi ke netaaon ke bhi chehre utre hue the
 The leaders were giving anything, but their gesture was showing that Kiran Bedi is also their concern
 asal main ye chintaa us mukaable kaa naam he, jisko kejariwal banaam kiran bedi kaha ja rahaa he
 Your people are worried because they have been believing that if someone can give a fight against Kejriwal as CM, then he is Kiran Bedi
 or kiran bedi ke bijepi main aane par unka dar sach sabit hota dikh rahaa he
 i will write further that this fear of the Aam Aadmi Party is justified
 dilli bijepi ke netaa isliye pareshaan hai kyonki unako aage badhane kaa mauka shaayad ab jaataa rahaa
 There are different groups within BJP within Delhi who are upset with the arrival of Kiran Bedi because she is a very big name and despite them she cannot get the responsibility of Delhi
 saath hi ye bhi baat he ki bijepi ke netaa ye sochate hai ki 17 saal se dilli kii satta se wo baahar hai or sangharsh kar rahe hai or ab jab aisa lag rahaa he ki wo bas dilli jeetne hi vaale hai or satta bas haath main ai samajho to koi baahar kaa aakar unke sar par baith jaae
 Well, the leaders of Delhi BJP may have been troubled by thinking about anything, which will be desired by PM Modi and party president Amit Shah
 aaiye ab zaraa dekh len ki arvind kejariwal banaam kiran bedi main koun kis par kitna baari dikhataa (jisaki vajah se aap chintit he) arvind kejariwal kii tarah kiran bedi kii chhavi bhi ek eemaandaar afasar kii rahi he
 Just as Arvind Kejriwal tried to reduce bribery by 49 days of strict rule, Kiran Bedi is recognized as a strict police officer
 purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii gaadi uthavakar mashhoor hui thim
 Kejriwal is a former IRS officer, while Kiran Bedi is a former IPS i
e
 both have the same class and the special thing is that both of them quit their government jobs before completing their jobs
 kejariwal or kiran bedi kaa mukhya kaaryakshetra dilli he, rahaa he
 But the Aam Aadmi Party's concern starts here that Kiran Bedi was considered a big name in the middle class, which is a big vote bank in Delhi politics
 mashhoor kejariwal bhi bahut the 2013 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav main, lekin sarkaar chhodane ke baad se middle class main kejariwal or unki party kaa graph gira
 Kejriwal remained the undisputed first choice as the chief ministerial candidate in all opinion polls, so the Aam Aadmi Party was contesting the election keeping Kejriwal's face ahead and directly attacking the BJP and asking who is your CM candidate? And BJP did not have Kejriwal's rival leader in Delhi
 khaastaur se jo itnaa popular ho
 BJP was campaigning keeping the face of PM Modi in front, but then it used to be that Modi is PM, CM will become a little
 haalanki siem ummidavaar ke taur par kiran bedi ke naam kaa elaan mushkil lagata, lekin media or public main charchaa karke dharna zarur ban sakati he ki bijepi jiti to siem kiran bedi hi banengin
 But now look at how Kejriwal tweeted for Kiran Bedi and said, "I have always been a fan of Kiran Bedi
 maine unhen hameshaa raajnneeti main aane ke liye manaane kii koshish kii
 i am glad that she has entered politics today '' yani kejariwal abhi bhi kisi tarah ke aarope, hamale, taane vagairah ke chakkar main nahin pad rahe jaise ki wo ab piem modi par hamale nahin karte bas bijepi ko nishaanaa banaate hai
 Nor is Kiran Bedi commenting on Arvind Kejriwal
 in donon ko ek baar raajnneeti ke anubhav ke taraazoo main tolein to dikhataa he ki kejariwal ne jahaan apni puri alag party banaai, sanghathan khadaa kiya, shunya se safar shuru kiya or pehle se sthapit do rashtriya partiyon se jamkar yuddh kiya
 In the last election, the Congress, which has been in power in Delhi for 15 years, has kept the BJP plagued in these elections too
 kejariwal ne jo kiya khud apane dam par kiya or puri party unke daam par tiki he
 So at the same time, Kiran Bedi got the platform ready to start her journey, the party she joined is already running in the golden period of her lifetime and after winning the country, she is going one state after another
 is
 party to pehle hi form main he or zyaada raajnneeti kaa anubhav kiran bedi ko na bhi ho to kya, sara kaam unako khud nahin karnaa he, jo unako party main laayaa he wo sambhaal bhi legaa
 Kejriwal had only one challenge in these elections so far that he had to explain to the public why he left the government and why he resigned? Because all the other issues are not visible in the eyes of the large public and Kejriwal, despite his declining popularity, remained the first choice as CM candidate due to his honest image, but now he will have to deal with a challenge more because BJP has honest The image has been answered with an honest image and the popular face has responded as a popular face
 ek baat ye bhi he ki kiran bedi wo naam hai jinke bijepi ke siem ummidavaar hone kii prabal sambhaavnaaen to hai hi, saath hi ek vakt main to aam aadmi party bhi unako dilli kaa siem ummidavaar banane kaa ofer de chuki he
 So has BJP played its master stroke by bringing Kiran Bedi? agar haa to sawaal ye he ki kejariwal ke paas iskaa kya jawaab he? This answer will tell how strong Kejriwal's claim is in Delhi's riots
 tippaniyan Kiran Bedi, the country's first female IPS officer, finally jumped into Delhi's riot
 kiran bedi ne bijepi jwine kar lee he or vah dilli vidhansabha kaa chunaav bhi ladengi ye bhi tay ho gaya he, lekin kahaan se ye tay nahin he or isko lekar bhi atakalein lag rahi hai ki kya kiran bedi dilli main bijepi kaa siem cheharaa ho sakati hai? or kya kejariwal kaa jawaab dilli main bijepi ke liye kiran bedi hi hai?

 4 days have passed since Pradyuman's death, but there are still some questions which the police have not been able to answer or do not want to express the helplessness of the investigation
 police ne apni press conference main is baat kaa bhi jawaab nahin diya ki aakhir us din pradhyumna ke saath hua kya tha? kaise wo bathrum tak pahunchaa, kaise bas kaa conductor bathrum tak puhancha
 Where did that knife come from and whether there were teachers or children around the bathroom at the time of the incident
 aise hi kuch sawaal dilli ajtak bhi gurugram police se puch rahaa he
 How was the arrest, where did the blood-soaked clothes go? According to the police, conductor Ashok cut the throat of the child while trying to misbehave and when people saw him, he picked himself up and took him to the hospital along with the school people
 skool ke ek mali ne ashok ko khun se sanaa chaaku dhote hue dekha tha, jiske baad funsane se bachane ke liye ashok ne khud hi shor machaana or bachche ko god main uthaakar bhaagna shuru kar diya
 At the behest of this gardener, Ashok was arrested, but when Ashok was arrested, was he in blood-soaked clothes or had changed his clothes at home
 ye bada sawaal he is par police khamosh he
 Why was the arrest not red-handed? According to the police theory, if the school gardener saw Ashok washing the knife in the bathroom, then why did the accused Ashok not be caught red-handed at the same time or at the instance of the student and teacher? Gone
 kahin skool prabandhan kuch chhipaane yaa dabaane kii koshish main to nahin kar rahaa he
 The police also have no answer to this question
 skool ne kyon saaf karaayaa khun?is baat kii shikaayat pradhyumna ke gharavaale bhi kar chuke hai ki skool prabandhan ne police ke pahunchane se pehle hi bathrum main pade khun ke dhabbe saaf kara die the
 The question is why the school administration did not leave the scene untill the police arrived
 jisase forensik avidence jutaaye ja sakate the
 The police is also silent on this matter and is taking action against the school administration only under the JJ Act
 jabaki saboot mitaane ke aarope main skool par ipisi kii dhara 201 ke tahat bhi karrwai honi chahie
 The secret of the knife still unresolved? According to the police, the accused took the knife from the tool box of the bus and went to the bathroom to wash it
 jabaki aamtaur par tul box main chaaku hota hi nahin he
 Now the question is whether the knife was bought by the accused himself or belonged to someone else
 bathrum main chaaku le jane ke masale par bhi police khamosh he
 How did the incident happen in just 15 minutes? According to the facts, Pradyuman's father gave him 7
 55 main skool ke get par drop kiya tha
 Whereas after just 15 minutes, they got the news of the child being bled
 aise main sawaal ye he ki aakhir itani jaldi ye vaardaat kaise ho gai wo bhi tab jab bathrum uske class se mahaj das kadam ke faasale par he
 At that time, many children were present in the class to the corridor
 police ke paas is sawaal kaa bhi koi jawaab nahin he

 They do not understand that if the judiciary lodges an objection in writing, it can be appealed, but the question of where to appeal the comment like 'cage in a cage' to the CBI is unanswered, because it Comment is not in writing

 petrol or dijal kii keemton main pichley 6 dinon se mil rahi raahat par buudhvaar ko brake lag gaya he
 There has been no change in the prices of petrol and diesel on Wednesday
 buudhvaar ko dilli main ek litre petrol kii keemat mangalvaar ke str par hi bani hui hai
 One liter petrol 75 here
 55 rupee prati litre he
 Talking about Kolkata, this 78 here
 23, mumbai main 83
 12 and this 78 in Chennai
 40 rupee prati litre kii dar se mil rahaa he
 Like petrol, there has also been no change in the prices of diesel

 kolkata main yah 69
 93 rupees, Mumbai 71
 51 or chennai main isaki keemat 71
 Remains at Rs 12 per liter
 bataa den ki isse pehle mangalvaar copetrol kii keemtonmen 14 se 18 paise tak katautee hui thi
 Talking about diesel, its prices were also reduced by 10-12 paise per liter

 In fact, on Wednesday, the price of crude oil has gone up
 buudhvaar ko brent crude 76 dollar prati bairal par pahunch gaya he
 It is feared that petrol and diesel prices may increase in the coming days
 vahiin, mangalvaar ko centre sarkaar ne aashwaasan diya he ki petrol or dijal kii keemton ko betahasha badhane nahin diya jayega or aam aadmi ko raahat dilaane ke liye har sambhav koshish kii jaaegi
 There are many things going on in the minds of all of us lying in bed before we sleep
 dinabhar kya kiya
 
 
 What was right 
 
 kya galat hua or na jane kya-kya
 It happens to all of us
 par kya aap jaanate hai sone se pehle, bistar par lete-lete ladkiyaan kya sochati hai?sone se pehle har ladki ke dimag main chalati hai ye 6 baaten:1
 Before sleeping, almost every girl thinks about her partner
 agar wo kisi ke saath relationships main he to uske bare main sochati he or agar single he to apane bhavi partner kii kalpana karti he
 2
 sone se pehle hi unhen agle din subah uthne kii chintaa sataane lagati he
 Setting an alarm and then placing it near the pillow so that its voice is directly in the ear
 sone se pehle hi agle din subah uthne, subah kya pahanenge, lunch kya le jaaenge or isi tarah kii kai choti-badi baton kii chintaa unhen sataane lagati he
 3
 raat ko sone seppehale ladkiyaan dinabhar ke ghatnakramonko riwind karke sochati hai
 4
 ladkiyaan sone se pehle apni us saheli bare main jarur sochati hai, jise wo khud se zyada sundar samajhati hai
 She also thinks about the most stylish girl in college and her dressage everyday
 5
 She also thinks about the girl behind whom all her college boys are crazy
 6
 Girls think about their life to come before bedtime everyday
 jisamen shaadi ke baad kii jindagi or kariyar se judi baaten shaamil hoti hai
 Congratulations comrades, your party Congress was successful
 ’ maine shishtacharvash vishakhapattanam airport par khadey us marxvaadi netaa se kaha
 'thank goodness' he says but does not look happy
 phir thode sa rukkar naaraaz sur kehete hai, ‘aapako pataa he mujhe central cameti se hataa diya gaya he

 cpm's new general secretary Sitaram Yechury was seen congratulating his comrades and all the journalists, as well as the staff at the airport
 yechuri sipiem ke paanchaven mahasachiv bane hai jinke saamne vajood khatm hone ke gambhir sankat se jujh rahi is vampanthi party ko dobaaraa zindaa karne kii chunauti he
 But when the new CPM general secretary Yechury was accepting greetings from everyone, then at that time this comrade, who had been raising the party flag for 45 years, was crying his grief in front of me
 sunit chopra kaa cheharaa hameshaa mujhe karl marks jaisaa lagata he
 He is an art critic
 apane bebaak vichaaron or khuli nidar raay ke liye party main jane jate hai
 i was surprised that at such crucial times when the party is churning on its shortcomings, comrades like Chopra have been removed from the Central Committee
 ‘aapako hataane kii koi khaas vajah? shaayad aap apane kala kshetra se jude kaam main vyast rahanaa chaahate hai
 'I say

 For the last 10 years, i have been continuously counting his shortcomings in the party
 yaad he na aapako?’ i remembered that when the CPM leaders kept silent or made statements while hiding the party's deficiencies from the media on the declining mass base of the party in Nandigram, Singur and Bengal and in Kerala, Sunit Chopra was unmindful and the truth even before the media Not afraid to accept
 aaj sunit chopra vishakhapattanam airport par logon se mil rahe or aupchaariktavash hansbol kar baat kar rahe the lekin kya unka hashr sipiem ke un netaaon jaisaa hi hone ja rahaa he jo party kii hawa ke khilaaf bolne kii sajaa pate hai
 Many years ago, Saifuddin Chaudhary and later Somnath Chatterjee were sentenced to speak out of the party's thinking or disobey the orders
 tippaniyan Sunit Chopra was a young man from a flourishing family who came to India after studying in England
 maine hameshaa unako bahut saadhaaran kurte pyjame or hawaii chappal main hi dekha
 i remember long ago he told me that he never took anything from the party
 bas use sab kuch dene kii hi sochi
 He has been on the CPM Central Committee for 20 years and today he was accusing Prakash Karat, one of the biggest leaders of CPM, of removing himself
 vah kehete hai ki unhen karaat kii haa main haa milaane kii sajaa bhugatni padi
 i had heard from the new CPM general secretary Yechury 24 hours ago that the party is self-critical and its new face will be seen
 lekin kya sunit chopra jaise logon ke liye usamen jagah nahin hogi
 'you can also be withdrawn in the Central Committee of the Comrade Party

 Most passengers on Air India flight from Visakhapatnam to Delhi on Monday were either journalists or communist leaders
 sipiem ke nae mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ko unke kamred or tamaam patrakaron ke alaava airport par karmchaaree bhi badhai dete dikhe
 Yechury has become the fifth general secretary of the CPM, who is facing the challenge of reviving this leftist party, which is facing a serious crisis of survival
 lekin jab sipiem ke nae mahasachiv yechuri har kisi se badhai sweekaar kar rahe the to us vakt koi 45 saal se party kaa jhanda uthaane vaala ye kamred mere saamne apana dukhada ro rahaa tha
 Sunit Chopra's face always looks like Karl Marx to me
 wo ek kala sameekshak hai
 Known at the party for his outspoken views and openly fearless opinions
 mujhe hairat hui ki aise nirnaayak vakt jab party apni kamiyon par manthan kar rahi he to chopra jaise kamred ko kendriya cameti se hataa diya gaya he

 - unhen laal phool or mithai kaa bhoga lagaayen
 - First remember Shri Rama, then bow to Hanuman ji and start the Sundarkand
 - paath ke ant main hanuman ji kii aarti karen
 - Deliver prasad after the end of worship

 - Completely follow Brahmacharya
 - bina shri ram kii puja ke iske paath kii shuruyaat na karen
 - The more it is read with emotion and meaning, the more this worship will be fruitful

 ’’ The Jharkhand High Court on Thursday dismissed the bail plea of rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo and former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav in the multi-crore fodder scam case
 isse pehle hoicourt ne 4 janvari ko jamaanat yachika par faisle ko surakshit rakh liya tha
 Following the dismissal of Lalu Prasad Yadav's bail by Justice Apresh Kumar Singh, RJD leaders said they would challenge the decision of the Jharkhand High Court in the Supreme Court

 This is an example of an eight-year-old girl found in the thick forests of Bahraich
 philhal iskaa baharich ke jila aspataal main ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Anyone can remember the fictional character 'mowgli' in the Jungle Book after seeing the child
 jangal main lambey samay se rahane se iskaa jeene kaa dhang bhi jaanwaron kii tarah hi ho gaya
 It moves the same way, eats the same way and screams on seeing any person coming near
 baharich police ne bacchee ko do maheene pehle motipur range main katarnia ghat ke jangal main bandaron ke jhund se nikaal kar jila aspataal main bhartee karaayaa tha
 It is being told that some villagers who picked wood in the forest saw the girl with the monkeys for the first time
 graminon ne use nikaalnaa chaha to bandar hamalavar ho gaye
 The villagers then informed the police
 police ne mushkil se bacchee ko surakshit vahaan se nikaala
 Dr
 DK Singh, Chief Medical Superintendent of the District Hospital, says that the condition of the girl child has improved a lot in two months
 jis vaktpuliceko ye bacchee mili thi tab uske sharir par koi kapadaa nahin tha
 Hair and nails were greatly enlarged
 lambey samay se jangal main rahane kii vajah se bacchee kaa vyavhaar bilkul jaanwaron jaisaa tha
 It had scratches on its body that could be caused by playing with animals
 medical pareekshanse bacchee kii umr 10 saal lagati he
 The child has now learned to eat by hand, but still feeds it on a plate, and first falls on the bed sheet
 insaani bhashaa nahin samajhane kii vajah se bacchee ke ilaaj main doctor or nursing staff ko bahut dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 a babysitter was required to take 24 hours duty to take care of the girl at all times
 police ke mutabik ye pataa lagaana mushkil he ki isejangalmen is haal main koun chhod gaya
 The entire staff of the district hospital has become attached to this girl
 har ek kii yahi koshish he ki bacchee jaldi se jaldi puri swasth ho jaae
 After getting the media headlines, DM, SP came to district hospital to take care of Mowgli girl of Bahraich

 The District Magistrate gave Mowgli girl a new name 'van Durga'
 asaram kii sabase khaas raajadaar shilpi jab kanoon ke daravaaje par pahunchi, to khud ko or asaram ko bekasoor bataane lagi lekin jaise hi jodhpur police se shilpi kaa saamana hua shilpi ke sur hi badal gaye
 According to Jodhpur police sources, initially, Shilpi tried his best to turn the police over but after that the police started throwing the arrows of questions as soon as the evidence was revealed
 iske baad to shilpi ne jo sholay ugalane shuru kiye uske baad to ab uski aanch kii tapish asaram ko or bhi jalaane vaali he
 Shilpi is telling Asaram innocent before herself
 kah rahi hai ki asaram ko fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Hey Shilpi ji, if you really thought that Asaram was being implicated, then why leave Bapu in this situation for a month? Why not come a month in advance and tell the truth that all the allegations against Bapu are wrong whereas after you Asaram the biggest charge is on you only
 aarope ye ki jis ladki kaa yon shoshan hua us ladki ko jodhpur ke ekantavaas main asaram tak aapane hi pahunchaaya
 If you were really innocent and who was hiding Asaram innocence for a month and why? Obviously, Shilpi is not telling the whole truth
 magar jodhpur police kii maane to sarender ke baad pichley choubees ghante main shilpi ne police ko jo kuch bataaya he wo shilpi ke is dialaag se bilkul alag he
 From Haridwar to Ahmedabad and from Ahmedabad to Chhindwara, girls studying in Gurukul and the truth of Bapu's exile, Shilpi is speaking all the secrets
 aise-aise raaj jo asaram ko or zyada musiibat main daalane vaale hai
 It is obvious that Shilpi has no less secrets, but there are some secrets, with the opening of which there will be more trouble for Asaram
 police ne shilpi se poocha he ki wo akhir asaram ke sampark main pehali baar kab ai? kab usne asaram ko apni jindagi samarpit karne kaa faisla kiya or kyon asaram ne use ahmedabad se haridwar or phir haridwar se chhindwara bheja?police ke liye ye sab jaananaa isliye bhi jaruri he kyonki is baar jis ladki ne asaram par yon shoshan kaa aarope lagaaya he, us ladki ko pehali baar asaram ne haridwar main hi dekha tha
 Was Asaram's dedication to Rajdar Shilpi a miracle of the tightening of the law or is the story behind Shilpi's dedication something else? These questions become even more important when, after the bail petition of Shilpi's Guru Asaram is dismissed in the lower court, now waiting for the decision of the High Court, but before the High Court decides on the bail of Asaram, His own lawyer Ram Jethmalani takes 15 days' deferment from the High Court to gather some evidence, whereas in the bail cases, such deferment is not for the defense, prosecution They are taken from side to side so that the bail can be deferred for more time but the matter is reversed here and the deferment is sought from Ram Jethmalani, one of the biggest lawyers in the country
 jaahir he, mohalat maangate hue jethmalani ko is baat kaa bhi ahsaas rahaa hoga ki unki is maang se unke muvakkil yani asaram kaa kuch or dinon tak salaakhon ke peeche rahanaa tay ho jayega, lekin iske baavjood asaram adaalat se mohalat kii guhaar karte hai or wo unhen mil bhi jaati he
 It is not known what Jethmalani is gathering during these days of time, but in the midst of this prolongation, the application of Shilpi for anticipatory bail in the High Court and surrender to the Sessions Court of Jodhpur after its dismissal is a lot in itself
 Says darasal, jodhpur police ke sutron or kanoon ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki is tarah jethmalani police kii tafteesh ko or lanbaa karne kii bajaay use ek mukaam tak pahunchane dena chaahate hai, taaki shuruuaati tafteesh ke baad police is maamle main jald se jald chaalaan daakhil kare or unhen asaram ke liye jamaanat kii guzarish karne main or aasaani ho
 There is a long story behind Shilpi's disappearance for so many days ahead of this visual composition of this famous lawyer of the country
 jaahir he, yon shoshan ke maamle main asaram hi mukhya aaropee hai, jabaki shilpi par unki madad karne kaa aarope he
 
 
 But despite this, the main accused gets caught by the police, but there is no trace of the craftsman
 to kya ye maan liya jaae ki shilpi ab tak khud apane dam par hi faraar chal rahi thi yaa phir asaram ke ishaare par hi uske logon ne shilpi ko panaah de rakhi thi?police sutron kii maane to ye asaram ke log hi the, shilpi ab tak jinke paas chup kar apane guru ke ishaare kaa intazaar kar rahi thi or jab loar court se asaram ke jamaanat kii arzi khaarij hone ke baad ye hai court tak pahunchi or unke vakil ne hai court se mohalat lee, to asaram ne hi shilpi tak samarpan ke liye apni baat pahunchaai or shilpi ne bilkul usee jodhpur police kii naak ke neeche jodhpur ke seshan court main samarpan kar diya, jo jodhpur police itane dinon tak haath dho kar uske peeche padi thi
 During the dedication in Jodhpur Sessions Court, the craftsman who was telling her Asaram innocent in every way, that same craftsman had said a few days ago that she does not know Asaram
 aisa ham nahin kah rahe, balki ye likhaa he shilpi kii ore se di gai us agrim jamaanat arzi main jo usne 4 sitambar ko jodhpur kii seshan court main daakhil kii thi lekin ye pehla mauka nahin tha, jabaki shilpi ne asaram se apane sambandh naa hone kii baat kahi
 Even before this, when the Jodhpur Police questioned Shilpi on 23 August at Chhindwara Ashram, Shilpi had told that she would not meet Asaram, but even then she had told the police that on March 15, she had done Chhindwara i have joined a job in the ashram and it has been here for only six months
 lekin ab shilpi ke bare main police ko jo baaten pataa chal rahi hai, wo uske is jhooth se pardaa hataati hai
 Shilpi aka Sanchita Gupta was not only a devotee of Asaram since childhood, but her parents were also disciples of Asaram
 yahaan tak ki apane mata-pita ke saath usne bhi asaram se diksha lee or phir taumr asaram ke ahmedabad ashram main hi rahane kaa faisalaa kar liya
 a master of psychology in psychology from Raipur, Shilpi was sharp from the beginning and had dedicated herself to Asaram
 asaram ko apane raajadaar ke rup main aisi hi kisi aadki kii darkaar thi or shilpi ko dekhte hi unhone use naa sirf jimmedaari balki bahut se adhikaar de die
 Now Shilpi started throwing girls one by one at the behest of Asaram and sent them to Asaram for surrender
 iske liye wo aksar ladakiyon par bhoot-pret hone kii baat kahati or asaram se ilaaj karwaane par jor detii
 The victim girl has told in a statement to the police that Shilpi always used to write something about ghosts in a paper and like other girls, Shilpi had told her to be a victim of ghosts and Shilpi Chhindwara a similar gimmick was also given to a girl from k Gurukul who has been absconding since the matter came to light
 bhartiya janata party(bijepi) chunaavon ke liye hameshaa ection mod main rahane vaali party ban gai he
 BJP is always ready for elections
 bijepi kisi bhi rajya ke chunaav main bada target rakhti he, iske liye party ke kaaryakarta se lekar adhyaksh tak jaan jhonk dete hai
 But the path is not easy for the BJP in the country's capital Delhi
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne prachand jeet hasil kii
 In this election, BJP has captured seven seats in Delhi
 vahiin 6 maheene baad hi dilli main vidhansabha kaa chunaav he, jisko lekar bijepi ne taiyaariyaan shuru kar di he
 a strategy is being chalked out to win this election, in view of which meetings are being convened continuously
 in baithkon main loksabhaa chunaav main booth viz kahaan kami rahi or kahaan kaam karne kii jarurat he, ise lekar dilli bijepi ke sanghathan mantri siddharthan vidhansabha viz netaaon ke saath baithak kar rahe hai
 Surprisingly, just a few days ago, the Delhi BJP, which has cleared the opposition, wants to win 60 seats instead of 70 seats in Delhi Assembly
 bijepi ne vidhansabha chunaav ke maddenjar dilli ke 70 vidhansabha sito main se 60 siten jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 In view of this, a meeting will be called on June 8 and 9 in which the equation will be discussed on which seat to decide
 bijepi ke chunavi vishleshan ke mutabik vidhansabha siton ke mutabik bijepi ko dilli main 65 siton par banpar jeet hasil hui he to vahiin 5 vidhansabha kshetron main bijepi congress se pichad gai he
 There are 7 seats in the Delhi Lok Sabha and about 10 assembly constituencies fall under each seat
 in boothon par pade voton kaa vishleshan karne par pataa chalata he ki dilli ke 13,816 boothon par bijepi ne jeet hasil kii he lekin 10,088 boothon par bijepi kii haar hui he
 These booths are mostly Muslim dominated areas and some cluster areas
 to vahiin vidhansabha viz dekhen to bijepi 70 main se 5 siton par bijepi haari he, dilli main 7 aisi vidhansabha site hai jinako muslim bahulya ilaake mana jaataa he
 But BJP lost 5 out of 7 seats while BJP won by a very small margin on 2 seats
 jabaki baaki jagahon par banpar vot mili hai, jin par vidhansabha kii site haari hai usamen utar purvi sansadeey kshetra ke tahat aane vaale ek vidhansabha kshetra silampur main bijepi kii haar hui he jahaan se saansad manoj tiwari he
 On the other hand, the two assembly constituencies falling under Manoj Tiwari's parliamentary constituency Baburpur and Mustafabad won by a small margin
 purvi dilli sansadeey kshetra ke okhla vidhansabha kshetra se bijepi kii haar hui he, jahaan se saansad gautam gambhir he to vahiin chandani chowk sansadeey kshetra ke tahat aane teen vidhansabha kshetra matia mahal, chandani chowk or ballimaran se bijepi kii haar hui he
 The margin of bjp's defeat from Chandni Chowk constituency is very less
 yahaan se saansad dow harshavardhan hai
 Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that we take two steps behind as much as we can so that we do not have to look back tomorrow
 dilli main bijepi 22 saal se satta se baahar he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections too, BJP had won all the seven seats in Delhi, but after 8 months, in the 2015 assembly elections in BJP, BJP was reduced to 3 seats
 loksabhaa chunaav main bhale hi bijepi ko badi jeet mili he lekin dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi bahut nishcint hai
 Delhi assembly elections are due in 2020
 bijepi ko dar he ki 2014 kii galati doharaai na jaae
 BJP leaders also believe that elections are fought on local issues in Delhi
 loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main bahut antar hota he, aise main bijepi ko bhi dar sata rahaa he

 Vajpayee said that Krishna created a language of his own which includes Hindi and Punjabi
 unke paas ek sadhi hui bhashaa he or har charitra apni hi bhashaa bolta he
 It is possible to be a human being and to be a human even in difficult circumstances, Krishna Sobti told us

 He said that he was a very scholar but never put his burden on his literature
 vaajapeyi ne kaha ki hindi main namvar singh ne aisi aalochana bhashaa di jo aam baatcheet ke kaaphi nikat thi
 50 years of Hindi literature cannot be spoken without these two personalities

 Writer Nirmala Jain said that Krishna Sobti was my deepest friend
 unhone kaha ki namvar singh meri liye guru the or in donon kaa janaa hamaare liye badi kshati he
 Nirmala said that there is no age for reading and writing, i have learned this from both of them

 If your eyes and intellect are safe then you can live this hobby throughout your life

 He always wrote keeping in mind the special readership and due to this cleverness, he ate in life

 jabaki uttari dilli nagar nigam or dilli sarkaar ke shahari awaas sudhaar board (DUSIB) par ek-ek lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya gaya he
 Concerned about the increasing pollution in the capital, the NGT had warned the government and the MCD many times earlier
 aakhirkaar NGT ne ek kamity banaakar jurmaana tay karne ko kaha tha
 To be filled in two months, the penalty committee has said in its report that the railway tracks are very dirty and the dirt spread there is not only increasing pollution but also causing health problems

 The atmosphere of sadness and determination was simultaneously reflected in the Yuva Vichar Mahakumbh organized by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Lucknow on 23rd of November last
 vistaarit sangh parivaar—yani bhartiya janata party, uske chaatr sanghathan akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad (abivipi), vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) or duusare sanghathanon ke 5,000 se zyada yuva uttar pradesh kii rajdhani main ikatthe hue the
 It was described as a brainstorming session on important national issues in preparation for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath jab mukchay atithi ke taur par udghaatan satr main bolne ke liye khadey hue to achaanak sabha sthal par ho-hallaa shuru ho gaya
 Voices began to rise from the midst of this noise: "the one who builds the temple, the vote will go to him
" ''apane anushaasit kaaryakartaaon ke liye jane jane vaale is sanghathan main aresas ke sah-sarkarywah dattatreya hosbale or krishna gopal or uttar pradesh ke upmukhyamantriyon—keshav prasad maury tathaa dinesh sharma sareekhe bade netaaon kii maujuudagi main yah narebaaji is baat kaa ishaara thi ki is parivaar ke liye mandir kaa mudda siyaasi taur par kitni sanjidagi akchityar kar chukaa he
 It was only after the senior leaders of the RSS intervened and pacified the youth that Yogi could begin his speech with a few minutes' interval
 alabatta do din baad 25 november ko jab aresas ne ram mandir banane ke liye adhyadesh laane par jor daalane ke makasad se desh bhar main reliyaan yojit kin, tab yah matra sanghathan pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa kii raay ko kuch zyada jagah dene ke liye taiyaar tha (bangaluru main hosbale apwaad the)
 Union insiders claim that the 'anti-temple forces' were more targeted at their attacks and perhaps even the Supreme Court as it did not prioritize the hearing of the Ayodhya case
 aresas ke netaa ab kehete hai ki yah bhi nappi-tuli ranneeti kaa hissaa tha taaki centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar ke upar dabaav banaae rakhaa ja sake
 The important thing is that since then the tone of rhetoric on the Ram temple has been softened slightly
 yahaan tak ki pichley hafte ek intervyuu main die gaye modi ke is bayaan par ki unki sarkaar adaalat kaa faisla aane ke baad hi duusare vikalpon kii chaanbin karegi, parivaar main waisi pratikriya nahin hui jaisi unke is jaahir ziddeepan par ho sakati thi
 The saint brigade, usually in combat posture, also maintained peace over it
 aresas ne modi ke rukh kaa swaagat karte hue ek bayaan tak jari kiya
 The statement of poison-spewing VHP national secretary Rajendra Pankaj is also, contrary to expectation and sadness, full of sorrow and remorse
 "the top court should give priority to the temple issue
" uskaa rukh hindu samaaj ke liye takalifdeh he
 After saying that we welcome the Prime Minister's statement that only after the court option is over, other options will be taken
 vihip is mudde ko 31 janvari ko kumbh meley main yojit apni dharm sansad main phir uthayega
 This time the response of the VHP-RSS is in stark contrast to the aggressive campaign it had run against the bjp-led Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 2002-2004
 to lakhanu ke yuva vichaar mahakumbh main is kadar uksaave kii kya vajah thi? kya yah mahaj ek tamaasha bhar tha jo 16 november ko dilli main bhaajapa ke ek sheersh netaa, aresas or vihip ke bade padaadhikariyon or do pramukh vakeelon ke bich hui gupachup baithak main bani rajamandi ke hisse ke taur par khelaa gaya tha? bataaya jaataa he ki is baithak main mandir mudde par gahan charchaa hui or ranneeti banaai gai
 At the end of the conversation, the BJP leader apparently told the RSS and VHP officials, "you should intensify the atmosphere among the youth of the country about the Ram temple, leave the rest to us
" '' bataaya jaataa he ki modi ke kareebi sutron ne bhi aresas ke aalaa ohadedaaron ko yahi sandesh bhijwaya tha
 Modi or BJP president Amit Shah may soon go on a public visit to the disputed site in Ayodhya to increase his bet
 beshak is nai ranneeti kaa makasad sheersh adaalat ke upar saarvajanik dabaav badhanaa bhi he, khaskar tab jab bharat ke pradhan nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi ne apane purvavarti deepak mishra ke nirdesh ko yah kahkar ulat diya tha ki mandir mudda praathamikta nahin he or agali sunwaayee ke liye 4 janvari kii taarikh tay kar di thi (is taarikh ko gogoi ne kaha ki teen sadasyon kii ek peeth 10 janvari se is mudde kii sunwaayee karegi)
 Swami Jitendranand Saraswati, the general secretary of the All India Sant Samaj, is a strong critic of the court's stand
 ''insaaf keval hona hi nahin chahie, hota hua dikhnaa bhi chahie
 The court may be acting against the principles of jurisprudence by not prioritizing the temple case
 ''modi ke taaja rukh ko sangh parivaar ke netaaon ke is vishwaas kii prishthbhumi main dekha janaa chahie ki vivaadit sthal par mandir ke haq main unka paksh itnaa majboot he ki agar adaalat fast trek sunwaayee kare to kuch hi sunwaayiyon ke baad faisla unke paksh main aa jayega
 Sources close to Modi and Shah say that if they finally decide to bring an ordinance on the temple issue, then raising the noise on the issue will also help to justify it
 bhaajapa kaa sheersh netritv haalanki koi jokhim mol nahin le rahaa
 It is said that Modi specifically cites the 1992-93 temple incident when the Congress-led central government sacked four BJP state governments after the Babri mosque was demolished and six months later when elections were held
 So the BJP could not return to power in two of these states
 party ke ek bade padaadhikari kehete hai, ''koi bhi faisla lene se pehle hamen aankna hoga ki logon ke bich is mudde par kitna samarthan he
 "apart from this, Modi strongly wants him and his party to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections on the strength of their record of good governance, rather than raising emotional religious issues like the Ram temple
" pradhanmantri mandir ke mudde par desh main ho sakane vaali sambhavit hinsa ko lekar bhi saavdhaan hai, jisase party kii sambhaavnaaon par asar pad saktaa he
 Meanwhile, there is an opinion among the Sangh leaders that there is tremendous support among the common people on the Ram temple issue
 ve november ke baad mandir mudde par aresas kii aguai main nikaali gai darjanon reliyon main yuvaaon kii baari maujuudagi kaa hawala dete hai
 Out of these four rallies, the presence of more than lakh people was stated
 ve is ore bhi ishaara karte hai ki congress ke aadhikarik pravaktaa is mudde par tivi kii bahason se kanni kaat rahe hai
 Swadesh Singh, former BJP youth vice president and political analyst, says, "the top Congress leaders are shying away from the media coming out on this issue, a sure sign that they fear the importance of the issue among people and Is the weight
 '' congress ke netaa kehete hai ki yahi sahi ranneeti he, kyonki koi bhi chook yaa galat kadam chunavi daud main rahul gandhi kii 'naram hindutv' kii nappi-tuli ranneeti ko gadabada saktaa he
 During the election race of Rajasthan, former Union Minister C
 pi
 Joshi was taught the lesson of discipline when he said that "only Congress can build Ram temple
" bhaajapa to siyaasi phaayde ke liye iskaa dohan hi karegi
 It is said that the top leadership of the party pulled Joshi for this statement
 modi or shah or bhaajapa ke duusare bade netaaon ko ab bhi lagata he ki shahari ilaakon main khaskar janamat banane vaale tabakon main, ram mandir ke mudde par samarthan abhi bahut tej nahin he
 a top BJP leader told India Today: "the issue of the temple is not as hot as it was in 1992, although it still has a lot of resonance in rural areas, we have to create an atmosphere in urban areas
 ''haal main sambodhit kii gai apni reliyon main aresas ke mukhiya mohan bhagwat ne bhi sweekaar kiya tha ki ''sarkaar ram mandir par adhyadesh laae, iske liye hamen janata kaa samarthan jutanaa hoga kyonki sarkarein keval janata ke samarthan ke aage sheesh nawati hai

 The health of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is very delicate
 nai dilli ke ames aspataal main bhartee vaajapeyi kii tabiyat pichley 24 ghante main kaaphi kharaab hui he
 Many Union ministers including Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived to find out his health
 vaajapeyi kaa rutaba bhartiya raajnneeti main kaaphi ooncha he, party line se hatakar netaa unka sammaan karte hai
 In 1998, when Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, India under his leadership conducted a nuclear test
 is faisle se puri duniya chakit rah gai thi
 On 11 May 1998, India became a nuclear state with the successful testing of three bombs in Pokhran, Rajasthan
 ye desh ke liye garv kaa pal tha
 In such a situation, if asked who is the Prime Minister who made India a nuclear nation? Atal Bihari Vajpayee will get the answer
 haalanki 19 march 1998 ko duusari baar pradhanmantri kii kursi par baithne ke liye atal ko kai kshetreey partiyon se samjhaute karne pade the
 Therefore, it was not so easy to make India a nuclear nation
 aaie jaanate hai ki kaise atal bihari vaajapeyi ne piem rahane ke dauraan kaise newclear state ko hari jhandi dikhaai thi
 In 1998, the Bharatiya Janata Party even agreed to 'reevaluate the country's nuclear policy and the option to deploy nuclear weapons'
 iskaa asar party kii chhavi par bhi padaa tha
 In April 1998, Jasjit Singh, director of the Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis (IDSA), said, "his (bjp's) image is such that he will do the first thing to test the atomic bomb, but he has shown great restraint
 ’ aise main kaha ja saktaa he ki jasjit singh ko agle maheene pokharan main hone vaale test kaa zaraa bhi andaaza nahin tha
 Nuclear test work was continuing behind the scenes
 vahiin 1998 main hi senadhyaksh veepi malik ne sena kii demand khulkar saamne rakhi thi
 On 21 April 1998, he said, "the government should develop the military's strategic deterrence capability to meet the increasing challenges of nuclear weapons and missiles
" ’sena pramukh kii taraf se ai demand ke thik do dinon baad raksha mantralay ke vaigyanik salaahkaar apije abdul kalam ne rakshaamantri kii samiti ko newclear project kii jaankaree di
 The committee was headed by then defense minister George Fernandes
 atal isliye bhi pareekshan jaldi karnaa chaahate the, kyonki china ke boote parmaanu hathiyaar dikhaa rahe pakistan ne gauri missile safaltaapurvak test kar lee thi
 Pakistan's Information Minister Mushahid Hussain described the development of Gauri as 'an attempt to balance power in South Asia'
 gauri ke alaava paak ‘gazanvi missile’ par bhi kaam kar rahaa tha
 At the same time, apart from china-pakistan alliance, many western countries including America and Japan were pressuring India to sign CTBT
 11 may kii us garm dopaher ko pradhanmantri atal bihariwajpeyine apane sarkari ghar 7 res course main ek press conference bulaai
 Atal gave information about the nuclear plan in this press conference
 haalanki atal bihari parmaanu test kaa shrey purv piem pivi narsimha raav ke dete hai
 Paying tribute to Rao, Atal had said, 'in May 1996, when i took over as Prime Minister after Rao, he told me that the bomb was ready
 maine to sirf visphot kiya he
 'actually Rao prepared for the test in December 1995, but then he had to postpone his plan for some reason
 iske peeche kai theory ginai jaati hai
 a report by India Today claims that very few people know that the only decision Atal had taken in his 13-day government in 1996 was to give the green signal to the nuclear program
 lekin jab unhen laga ki unki sarkaar sthir nahin he, to unhone ye faisla radd kar diya
 One thing is certain from all these incidents that both Rao and Atal were serious about the nuclear program and wanted to test it
 vaajapeyi ne apane kai bhaashanon main is parmaanu test kaa shrey parmaanu urja vibhaag ke adhyaksh aar
 Chidambaram and also the head of the second Defense Research and Development Institute, APJ Abdul Kalam

 According to the Congress, this loss to the state government has come from the decision taken in 2003 and it is special that at this time there was Narendra Modi government in the state along with BJP government at the center

 The mining rights in the KG Basin were given to Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC), a Gujarat government company, in 2003
 march 2003 main hi jiespisi ne videshi company jeeyoglobal resorces ke saath ek samjhauta karte hue 10 pratishat hissaa use de diya gaya tha
 The scams are adding up, but will the PM and his government care to answer these questions regarding GSPC, which are a matter of concern to every tax-paying citizen? # modigspcscam2pic

 com / 5l7lugyoxs — Congress (@incindia) December 8, 2017 After which GSPC was alleged that Geoglobal was made a partner without any tender process despite having no experience in mining
 ab congress ne aarope lagaaya he ki pradhanmantri kaa bayaan ki na khaaunga na kisi ko khaane duungaa mahaj ek jumala he
 According to the Congress, during the tenure of the Modi government in the state, irregularities were incurred during the procurement of domestic and international sources and the state exchequer has suffered huge losses
 congress kaa pehla savaalcongress ne kaha ki is jiespiel kaa 80 fisadi share oil and natural gas corporation (oengisi) ne aise vakt main kharida jab keji basin main gas kii khoj hui bhi nahin thi
 This share was bought by ONGC for Rs 7,738 crore
 lihaaja, congress ne sawaal poocha he ki 2005 ke baad keji basin main bina gas paae kyon oengisi ne jiespiel ke shares kharide the? kya yah kharid ke jariye jiespiel ke ghate ko chhipaane kii koshish kii gai?congress kaa doosraa savaalcongress ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki is deal ke vakt jiespiel ke jitne bhi nideshak the unhen maujuuda samay main kendra sarkaar dwaara bade-bade padon par rakhaa gaya he
 According to the Congress, it also includes the current governor of the Central Reserve Bank of India, Utrij Patel as he was present on the independent director of GSPL at the time of the GSPL-ONGC deal
 lihaaja is tatthon ke daawey ke saath congress ne kaha ki yah puraa maamla dikhaata he ki pradhanmantri dwaara prachaar kiye ja rahe gujarat model kii sachai kya he
 The Congress Party, citing the report of the Controller and Auditor General, said that GSPL had a total of 64 gas blocks, out of which 11 were Overseas gas blocks
 inhen 11 gas blox ko sarender karne par aniyamitata dekhne ko milti he
 The Congress quoted the CAD report as stating that these irregularities alone had resulted in loss of revenue of Rs 1757 crore to the state government
 ise bhi padhein: Exclusive: gujarat kaa khemka? iskar adhikari ke nilamban par khadey ho rahe kai savaalcongress ke mutabik jiespisi main 20,000 karod rupee dub jane ke baad 4 agast ko bharat sarkaar kii navratna company oengisi ne is ghaataa uthaane vaali company ke 80 fisadi sheyaron ko 7,738 karod rupee main kharid liya
 On the allegations made by the Congress, BJP leader and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley clarified that the Congress party had given the most corrupt government to the country during its 10-year tenure, so now it can take the issue of corruption before the Gujarat elections
 Is manufacturing jetali ke kaha ki thik isi tarah congress party ne rafel deal par sawaal uthaaya jabaki yah deal do deshon kii sarkaar ke bich hui he jisase kisi tarah ke bhrashtachar kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Jaitley said that now the Congress is raising the issue of GSPC
 congress ke aaropon par jetali ne kaha ki jis jagah jiespisi ko khanan kaa contcact mila tha vahiin oengisi bhi khanan kar rahi thi
 But when the project did not have economic viability for GSPC, the contract went from one government company to another
 lihaaja is maamle main bhi kisi tarah ke andeh kii sambhaavna nahin he or congress dwaara lagaae ja rahe sabhi aarope puri tarah bebuniyaad he

 lalu yadav ne kaha, ‘rahul kaa adhyaksh pad se istipha dena sangh parivaar ke khilaaf ladaai lard rahi partiyon ke liye jhatka hoga, ye bijepi ke trep main girane jaisaa hoga
 As soon as someone other than Gandhi family becomes president, Narendra modi-amit Shah will call him a remote-run president by rahul-sonia '
 Rahul’s offer to resign suicidal
