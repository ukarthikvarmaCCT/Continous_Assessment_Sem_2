kareeb 61 karod logon ko naino car muft mil sakati thi
 Every Indian could get 56 thousand rupees, or one lakh 82 thousand rupees for every 40 crore people living below the poverty line
 yani puure desh kii tasviir badal sakati thi
 The picture shows that India is a country of poor people
 par duniya ke sabase bade amir yaheembasate hai
 If this is not the case, then we would not have got the maximum money in the Swiss bank account
 aankadon ke mutabik swiss bank membharatiyon ke kul 65,223 arab rupee jamaa he
 That is, the amount of money we have in our Swiss bank is 6 times of our GDP
 aankade ye bhi bataate hankibharat ko apane desh ke logon kaa pet bharne or deshchalane ke liye 3 lakh karod rupee kaa karj lenaa padataa he
 This is the reason that while the per capita income on the one hand is increasing, on the other hand the debt on every Indian is also increasing
 agar swiss bainkon main jamaa blike mani kaa 30 se 40 fisadi bhi desh main aa gaya to hamen karj ke liye imef yaa vishwa bank ke saamne haath nahin failaane padenge
 If the black money deposited in Swiss bank of Indians, if the money is returned, then the country will not have to impose any tax in the budget for thirty years
 aam aadmi ko inakam tex nahin dena hoga or kisi bhichij par custom yaa cell tex nahinlagegaa
 The government wants to connect all the villages with roads
 iske liye 40 lakh karod rupee kii jarurat he
 If black money is returned from Swiss bank, then a four lane road will reach every village
 jitna dhan swiss bank main bharatiyon kaa jamaa he, use uskaadhabhimil jaae to kareeb 30 karod nai naukariyaan paidaa kii ja sakati he
 2000 rupees can be given free to every Hindustani
 aurayah silsilaa 30 saal tak jari rahaa saktaa he
 That is, poverty can be completely removed from the country
 par aisa ho iske liye pehle bhrashtachar or rishwat par jhaadu pherana jaruri he
 But the question is the same, when will the broom come on them? On December 28, a dream was sown in the womb of this beautiful land of Ramlila Maidan
 ab uski koplein foot rahi hai
 For the first time you have seen your humankar win publicly
 par vahi bhrashtachar kahin ise haraa naa de? kyonki dar main lipta sawaal ab bhi vahi he
 How will we all give up the intoxication of corruption that has been filled in the veins? in dinon watsap apane fitures kii vajah se nahin, balki child pornography ko lekar surkhiyon main he
 For some time, there have been continuous reports that groups are being formed on whatsapp for child pornography in many countries including India
 in grups main ghadlle se aise contant share bhi kiye ja rahe hai
 Now whatsapp has taken steps and more than 1 lakh 30 thousand accounts have been blocked and deleted
 haal ke 10 dinon main company ne in acounts ko watsap se hataanaa shuru kiya he
 The company recently said last year that such accounts are sorted by resorting to artificial intelligence
 watsap ne ye acounts AI tuls ke jariye dhundha or phir inhen avaidh activity kii vajah se delit kiya gaya
 Significantly, whatsapp's chats are end to end encrypted
 is security kaa matlab ye he ki watsap par bheje gaye massej yaa contant sirf sender or resiver hi dekh yaa pard saktaa he
 Not only this, even the company cannot read them
 isliye hi watsap avaidh contant ke liye AI kaa sahaara le rahi he
 This tool checks the un-encrypted information of the whatsapp account
 inamen profile photo, group profile photose or group information shaamil hai
 These are removed by testing
 watsap photodna naam kaa bhi tul yuj karata he jise fasebuk yuj karata he
 Under this, porn and abusive images are identified and potential whatsapp groups or users who can share it are banned
 watsapake pravaktaa ne child pornography kii report ke baad die ek bayaan main kaha he, ‘whatsapp child sexual abyuj ko lekar jiro tolerance policy rakhata he
 We have deployed our most advanced technology to deal with it, which includes Artificial Intelligence
 ye profile photose ko scan karata he or andeh hone par acounts bain karata he
 We have also responded to the investigating agencies of India and other countries
 chunki ap stores or communication sarvice ko abujiv contant failaane ke liye yuj kiya ja rahaa he, isliye isse nipatane ke liye tech companiyon ko mil kar kaam karnaa hoga’haal hi main ek report main kaha gaya tha ki third party eps ke jariye watsap group ke naam ko search kiya ja rahaa he
 whatsapp has said in its reply that whatsapp does not provide any feature that can be used to search for groups from a third party app
 watsap kaa tul aapke acount ko bhi delit kar saktaa he agar aap aise kisi avaidh group ke saath judate hai
 Since anyone can add you to their group without permission right now, you should be careful and report to such accounts or groups that share the content of child pornography

 Yogi Adityanath government of Uttar Pradesh is going to take strict measures against fake madrasas in the state
 akele saharanpur jile main hi aise 17 farji madrason ke naam jila prashasan ne haal main ujagar kiye hai
 'aaj Tak' went to Ground Zero and did a reality check of such madrasas, which are included in the government's recognized list, but which do not have any existence on the ground
 saharanpur or devband main 750 madrase sarkaar kii manyata praapt list main hai
 Of these, 17 madrasas in Saharanpur alone were found to be fake after verification by the administration
 saharanpur main ‘aaj tak’ ne sabase pehle baliyakhedi gaanv kaa rukh kiya
 In the list of 17 fake madrasas of Saharanpur issued by the administration, the address of one madarsa was recorded - 'madrasa Muzaffar Islamic Academy, Balliakheri
 ’ baliyakhedi gaanv main ‘aaj tak’ ko is madrase kaa kahin koi ata-pataa nahin mila
 During the investigation, people told that this madrasa has been closed from here and shifted to some other village
 madrase par padhaane vaale shikshakon ke naam hairaan karne vaalegaanv ke kuch bacchon ne bataaya ki wo do saal is madrase main pard chuke hai
 The children took the names of the people who were teaching in the said madrasa and that was surprising
 kathith madrase main pard chuki ek ladki ne bataaya ki unhen teen mahilaayein bhi padhaati thim, jinke naam swati, puja or chhavi the
 Generally Hindu teachers do not teach in madrasas, because there is mostly Islamic training
 saal bhar pehle hi band ho chukaa madrasa, lekin kaagaj main chalubaliakhedi gaanv main jahanmadarasahone kaa daawa kiya gaya tha, vahaan imaarat to maujuud he, lekin usamen madrasa nahin log rahete hai
 The man who registered the alleged madrasa, Sarfaraz, was also found by Aaj Tak
 sarfaraj ne khud mana ki madrasa saal bhar pehle hi band ho chukaa he
 He also claimed that this madrasa has been started with the same name at another place
 saath hi online kar diya gaya he
 The board hung, but not the madrasa
 The next point of reality check of the Madrasas was Sheikhpura village in Saharanpur
 prashasan ke dastavej main is jagah par maujuud madrase kaa naam he- ‘jamiya marajul ulum’
 The building was found in Sheikhpura village, where the board of this madrasa is also hung
 ab yahaan sawaal uthaa ki agar madrasa maujuud he, to prashasan kii ore se isko farji kyon mana gaya? madrase kaa sach jaanane ke liye imaarat ke andar daakhil hone par shamsuddin naam ke shaks se baat kii gai
 Also read: 17 Madrasas running on paper only in Saharanpur, it was recognized that the school was run in this building
 baad main is pate par madrase ke registration ke liye prashasan ko arji di gai
 Shaheen Khan, the woman who registered the madrasa, was also talked about the case
 shaheen ke paas aise dastavej maujuud hai, jinke mutabik is madrase kaa registration isi pate par disambar 2013 main hua
 When Shaheen was asked why the madrasa government did not get it during the verification, Shaheen said that the letter sent by the administration went back to our absence, which led to all this
 shaheen ne yah bhi bataaya ki is madrase main do hindu bachche bhi padhate hai, ye bhi saamaanya se hat kar baat thi
 The board madrasa, but the school 'ajatak' then turned to Madrasa Islamic Mahmudiya Arabic Persian in Khata Khedi area of saharanpur for reality checks
 is madrase kaa naam bhi prashasan kii ore se jari 17 farji madrason kii list main shaamil he
 a building and a board were also found at the place of address
 board par likhaa tha- emm arabi farsi academy
 a person present in the building said that the school is being run here, not a madrasa
 reality check ke tahat phir ‘aaj tak’ pahunchaa khaataa khedi ke madrasa sar didaar arabi farsi tak
 There was also a building here and a board of madrasa was also placed on it
 yahaan jo sach saamne aayaa, usne farji madrason ke rahasy kii sari kalai khol kar rakh di
 Here, when a person named Mohammad Sharifuddin was asked that the building has a board of madrasas, where is the madrasa? On this, Sharifuddin said that the school is run here, not the madrasa
 sharifuddin ne camere par khulaasa kiya ki kisi shaks ne unhen paise kaa laalach dekar kaha tha ki imaarat ke ek hisse par kathith madrase kaa board laga kar chhod de
 The lure of money is given to the madrasa board on the buildings
 Uddin revealed on Aaj Tak's camera that a person lured him with money and told him to leave a part of this building by putting the coffin of the alleged madrasa
 Give ye jaanane ke baad saaf ho gaya ki madrason ke naam par sarkari sahaayta jhatakane ke liye aise mafia kaam kar rahe hai, jo logon ko apni imaaraton par madrase kaa board lagane ke evaj main paise dene kaa laalach dete hai
 Action will be taken against fake madrasas
 When Saharanpur District Collector PK Pandey was informed about the reality check, he said, "your investigation is absolutely correct
" mere paas jo report he, uske mutabik un jagahon par sirf madrason kaa board laga hua he, lekin madrase vahaan nahin chal rahe hai
 Such places have been identified
 ”jiladhikari ne do took kaha ki final report aane ke baad in kathith madrason or inke peeche jo log honge, unke khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 Not only will the government grant money be recovered from them, but an FIR will also be lodged against them

 'da bourn legasy' (2012) main jermi rainer ne dastak di thi or film box offis par ausat rahi thi
 The film was expected to return to the old stage with the return of Matt Deemon, but the entire focus of the film rests on the action
 puri tarah se yah kisi video game jaisi lagati he or jesan uskaa ek paatr jaisaa, jabaki tony lee jones kisi khilaadi kii tarah puri film main usase khelte najar aate hai
 That too through his cameras spread all over the world
 jesan bourn siie kaa ek purana sadsy he or vah katl karne kii kala main maahir he
 But he does not control his agency and the sole purpose of the agency is to get him murdered
 iske liye europe main laashon kaa dher lag jaataa he lekin jesan he ki kisi ke haath nahin aata he
 The film has smoky action
 mat demen vaale teen part main najar aane vaala thrill or majboot script vaala factor missing he
 The film, in a way, resembles the rest of Hollywood's spice films, in which a CIA expert turns against his own agency and has some secrets that threaten the CIA, so she wants to end it
 is tarah film kii kahani ausat he or treetment bhi kuch khaas nahin he
 Matt's return to the film is fun
 mat kaa hard lucor bourn ke kirdaar main utar janaa mjedaar he
 Alicia Weekender, who made headlines worldwide for her performances in 'the Danish Girl' and 'X Makina', plays Agent Heather Lee in the film
 ve bhi thik-thaak hai, tommy lee jones is umr main bhi kamaal hai or unako dekhakar majaa aata he
 The fans of Jason Bourne Action and the fans of Jason will surely like those who were waiting for Matt
 ection or mat ko chhod diya jaae to yah ek ausat hollywood film he

 The Central Information Commission (CIC) has directed the Prime Minister's Office to disclose complaints of corruption and action taken against Union ministers between 2014 and 2017

 During the hearing, Chaturvedi told the Commission that he had sought specific information regarding verified copies of complaints submitted to the Prime Minister against Union Ministers which should be made available to him

 The Center formed a committee in the Union Ministry of Environment in 2010
 samiti kii report main chaturvedi kii daleelon main dam paaya gaya
 The ministry then confirmed Chaturvedi's harassment and recommended the cases filed against him be dismissed
 raashtrapati ne chaturvedi ke khilaaf darj in maamalon ko khaarij kar diya

 ' Jio Closed Off Net Free Calling Customers have asked TRAI to solve the soon
 Due to the interconnect usage charge ie IUC, Jio has decided to end the off net free calling on 9 October
 aise main ab jab IUC kaa boj graahakon ke hisse aayaa to unhone jeeyo kaa samarthan karte hue tri se jald se jald iskaa samaadhaan maanga he
 Jio's customers have filed an online petition to convey their demand to TRAI
 darasal tri kii ore se 2017 main IUC charge 6 paise prati minute tay kii gai thi or kaha gaya tha ki 1 janvari 2020 tak ise khatm kar diya jayega
 Because of this, Jio had made the calling free
 lekin haal hi main tri ne rivyuu ke liye aiusi se judaa kansaltesan paper maanga he or isaki sambhaavna he ki isaki avadhi badhaai ja sakati he
 In such a situation, it is not clear how long the IUC charges will end and due to this the pressure on Jio started increasing and the company has decided to stop off-net free calling
 saath hi jeeyo ne ye bhi kaha he ki IUC chargeej khatm hote hi wo phir se colling free kar degaa
 On the other hand, vodafone-idea and Airtel have made it clear that they will continue off-net free calling in unlimited plans for customers
 jabaki jeeyo ne 9 oktober ko ye elaan kiya ki ab jeeyo ke network se duusare network main kol karne par ab graahakon ko 6 paise prati minute kii dar se bhugtan karnaa hoga
 Meanwhile, when the burden of IUC charge came on the customers, they have filed an online petition to convey their demand to TRAI
 mili jaankaree ke mutabik ab tak lagbhag 10 hajaar se bhi zyada graahakon ne jeeyo kaa samarthan karte hue tri se IUC par jald faisla lene kii maang kii he
 Reliance Jio says that the company was offering free calling from its inception, but for this it has to pay a heavy price
 vajahen jo saamne aa rahi hai usamen bataaya ja rahaa he ki airtel or vodaphone-idia ke lower middle class ke liye jo tarriff plance unamem colling rate zyada hai
 Most of these customers are connected to 2G networks and use mobile exclusively for calling
 aise main ye graahak paise bachaane ke liye jeeyo ke graahakon ko missd kol dete hai or jab jeeyo ke graahak duusare network main phone karte hai to company ko 6 paise prati minute kaa bhugtan karnaa padataa he
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, is now beginning her campaigning
 somvaar ko priyanka prayagraj se boat yatra ke jariye apane is abhiyaan kaa aarambh karengi, jo pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi main khatm hoga
 Prior to this visit, Priyanka Gandhi has written an open letter to the public
 isamen unhone kaha he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne mujhe purvi upi kii jimmedaari di he
 My association with the people of UP is very old and today, together with everyone, i have got the responsibility of changing UP politics as a soldier
 priyanka ne kaha, 'aapaki baat sune bina parivartan nahin ho saktaa he, isliye main aapke dwaar pahunch rahi hum
 i will contact you by waterway, bus, train and padyatra
 ''gangaji kaa sahaara'apane khat main priyanka gandhi ne ganga ko sachai or samanta kaa pratik bataate hue kaha ki vah kisi se bhedbhaav nahin karatin
 He said, 'gangaji is the support of Uttar Pradesh
 main gangaji kaa sahaara lekar bhi aapke bich pahunchungu
 'let me tell you that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi said in Varanasi that i have not come, i have been called by Mother Ganga
 centre main sarkaar banane ke baad ganga safai ke liye baqayada alag mantralay bhi banaaya gaya
 However, till now the Opposition has been accusing the government of tricking the Ganga cleanliness
 aise main priyanka gandhi ab ganga yatra ke jariye hi piem modi ke sansadeey kshetra varanasi ja rahi hai, jahaan nadi kinare based gaanvon ke logon se vah logon se samvaad karengi
 According to sources, it is also being said that this may also be a reason behind Priyanka's boat trip, which can be seen in her election campaign

 There is no illegal mining in 34 hectares
 rajasthan sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya he ki unako mili satellite image ke dwaara yah dekhnaa hoga ki kitne aria main avaidh khanan hua he
 The comments sarkaar ne kaha ki abhi tak 27 pratishat kaam puraa hua he or isko puraa hone main 3 maheene kaa samay or lagegaa
 In the previous hearing, the Rajasthan government had accepted in the court that 28 of the 138 Aravalli hills had disappeared
 court ne rajya ke mukhya sachiv ko 48 ghante ke bheetar aravali ke 115
 Orders were ordered to stop illegal mining in an area of 34 hectares
 court ne kaha ki vah yah aadesh dene ke liye majaboor ho gaya he kyonki rajasthan sarkaar ne is maamle ko bahut hi halke main liya he
 The government said that 27 percent work has been completed so far and it will take 3 months more time to complete it
 pichhali sunwaayee main court main rajasthan sarkaar ne ye sweekaar kiya tha ki aravali kii 138 main se 28 pahadiyaan gaayab ho chuki hai
 Court sent Chief Secretary of State to Aravali 115 within 48 hours
 34 hectare kshetra main avaidh khanan rukvane ke aadesh die the
 The court said that it has been forced to give this order because the Rajasthan government has taken the matter very lightly
 court ne kaha ki vah yah aadesh dene ke liye majaboor ho gaya he kyonki rajasthan sarkaar ne is maamle ko bahut hi halke main liya he
 BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar accused in Unnao rape case will be investigated for activities inside Sitapur Jail
 peedit parivaar ne vidhayak par jail ke bheetar se apane logon se phone par baat karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Meanwhile, Devki Singhal, a member of the National Commission for Women, has reached the victim
 unhen police ne roak diya he
 Let me tell you, MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is accused of accident with the victim of Unnao rape case
 police ne kuldeep singh senger par hatya or hatya kii sajeesh kaa mukadmaa darj kar liya he
 After this, the state government has also decided to change the jail of Kuldeep Singh Sengar but no decision has been taken on it yet
 bataa den, kuldeep singh senger andertrial kaidi he
 Therefore, the state government has the right to decide to change the jail
 gauratlab he ki bijepi vidhayak kuldeep senger, uske bhai manoj senger or aath anya ke khilaaf sadak durghatana ke ek maamle main police ne ek praathmiki darj kii he
 The Unnao rape victim and her lawyer were severely injured in the accident, while two of their female relatives died in the accident
 aropiyon par dushkarm peedita ke chachaa mahesh singh kii shikaayat ke aadhaar par maamla darj kiya gaya, jo raibareli jail main band hai
 One of the women killed in the accident, Unnao, was a witness in the rape case
 dushkarm peedita kii maa ne daawa kiya ki yah durghatana unki beti or anya ko khatm karne kii ek sajeesh thi
 Actually the car in which the victim's family was traveling was hit by a high speed truck
 iske baad yah maamla ek bade vivaad main badal gaya
 The truck's owner, driver and cleaner have been arrested
 india today desh kaa mizaaj survey main shaamil 49 fisad logon ne kaha ki keval gaiyr-gandhi or gaiyr vanshavaadi netaa hi congress ko sire se khadaa kar saktaa he
 But when asked about the name of a potential leader who could kill in this Grand Old Party, 15 percent expressed confidence in Priyanka Gandhi and 11 percent
 ye virodhabhasi jawaab congress main vaikalpik netritv kii kami ko shaayad behatar tareeke se bayaan karte hai
 The events following the party's second consecutive defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in May show that the Congress has neither a strategy nor a political apology other than the Gandhi family
 party main nae or yuva netritv kii baaten to uthin, magar phir congress ke think-tanks ne aakhirkaar gandhi parivaar main hi aasraa khoja
 Rahul resigned from the post of president on 25 May
 agle 75 dinon tak congress kaarysmiti nahin samaj saki ki aage kya karnaa thik he
 His response was that the entire party started persuading Rahul to withdraw his resignation and when he could not convince them fell at Sonia's feet
 rahul ne party ke sheersh par sonia kii do dashak puraani hukumat ke baad disambar 2017 main unheen se party kii kaman sanbhali thi
 Twenty-two months later, Sonia has again replaced her son and has become interim president until the party's new president is elected
 to shikhar par sonia kii vaapasi ke congress ke liye kya myne hai? sab kuch pehle kii tarah hi chalata rahegaa
 Before Rahul became president in December 2017, the party had two power centers — 10 Janpath and 12 Tughlaq Road, i
e
 Sonia and Rahul's home respectively
 party main do dhade the jo inamen se kisi ek se jude the or unke bich bahut saare muddon ko lekar aksar takaraav hota rahata tha
 After December 2017, many leaders who had no political capital of their own were sidelined, but remained strong in the party simply because of their loyalty to Sonia
 unamem se zyaadaatar kaa pauva phir chal padegaa, haalanki team rahul ke peeche hatane kii kam hi sambhaavna he
 Recalling the events of the past two months, Rahul and his team are working on a strategy to separate and disassociate Rahul from the Congress's troubled legacy — the UPA government tainted by allegations of dynastic politics and corruption
 sonia kii vaapasi ne rahul ke ek sabase ahm makasad ko tahas-nahas kar diya he, jo ve istipha dekar sadhana chaahate the—yani unke vanshavaadi hone ke modi-bhaajapa ke aarope ko nazaij tehraana
 The results of the country's mood survey show that the saffron party's plight against dynastic politics has succeeded — 65 percent of the people say that voters have decisively rejected dynastic politics
 rahul ko bahut pehle iskaa ehsaas ho gaya tha; 25 may ko unhone is sambhaavna kii to kalpana hi nahin kii thi ki unki maa adhyaksh ban jaaengi
 On two occasions he had clearly stated that no person from the Gandhi family would sit in the top post of the party
 itnaa hi nahin, disambar 2017 se pehle ke daur main lautne se is baat kii koi sambhaavna nahin bachi ki party apane saamne maujuud bhitari or bahari sankat kaa rasta khoj paaegi
 Due to the inverse working style of the two centers of power and their warlords, decision making in the party will be slow
 saath hi, ab party main ek teesraa satta centre bhi ubhar rahaa he—uttar pradesh kii prabharee mahasachiv priyanka ke irdagird
 Hence, there is a possibility of further confusion within the party and bureaucracy
 vah bhi us vakt jab congress ko bhaajapa kaa muqabla karnaa he, jisane gahari jaden jamaa lee hai or jiske paas majboot chunavi mashinari he, us bharat main jahaan hindu rashtravaadi bhavanaaen apane sheersh par hai
 The BJP abolished the special status of Kashmir under Article 370 in a jolt and the opposition's response to it was mild and breathless
 isse yah dharna or pakki hogi ki bhaajapa kade faisle lene vaali party he
 The party is weak at both the level of organization and ideology to compete with the BJP
 lihaaja vah chunavi chunautiyon ke lihaaj se bhi lachar dikhaai pad rahi he
 The fact is that in the last two months, the Congress has come out of the country as an incompetent party to work in a bankrupt and united way with ideas
 shashi tharur or manish tiwari sareekhe vakpatu netaaon ke hote hue bhi congress ne pashchim bengal ke loksabhaa saansad adheer ranjan choudhary ko chunaa
 Clearly, loyalty to the first family of the party too overshadowed everything else here
 badtar yah ki choudhary ko vipaksh kaa netaa banane ke do anachaahe nattejey hue
 Chaudhary, a bitter critic of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, was not only given a high chair but also praised Sonia openly — she was introduced as a Bengal tiger in a meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party
 isse mamata kii trinmul congress or congress ke bich kii khai or chaudee ho gai
 The truth is that Mamata has emerged as the leader to replace Rahul as the face of opposition parties with the support of 19 per cent people in the country's survey
 congress loksabhaa chunaav ke liye dramuk, ensipi or rajd ke alaava kisi bhi duusari ahm bhaajapa virdohi party ke saath gathbandhan kaayam karne main naakaam rahi thi
 Says a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress, "far from emerging as the leader of these parties, we are either facing challenges or out of tune with those parties that are not part of the bjp-led NDA
 yahaan tak ki aap, bijd or tidipi ne bhi artical 370 par bhaajapa kaa samarthan kar diya
 The party had to face embarrassment in Parliament due to lack of clear instructions from the high command
 jab loksabhaa main anuchhed 370 khatm karne par charchaa chal rahi thi, choudhary ne ise bharat or pakistan ke bich dotarafa masalaa bataa diya
 Sonia and Rahul were surprised
 nape-tule andaaj main bolne vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya yaa deepender hooda sareekhe netaaon ne bhi anuchhed 370 par party ke rukh ke khilaaf bayaan de die
 Due to this mess, the process of leaving the party started
 karnataka main darjan bhar vidhayak party chhodkar chale gaye jiskaa nateeja janata dal (secular) or congress kii gathbandhan sarkaar ke girane main hua
 This is what happened in Goa
 congress ke 10 vidhayak bhaajapa main chale gaye
 But the most shocking resignation was that of the party's Mukesh whip Bhubaneswar Kalita, an old loyalist of the Gandhi family, in the Rajya Sabha
 unhone thik usee din istipha diya jab anuchhed 370 ko kamjor karne kaa sankalp or jammu or kashmir ko do hisson main baantne kaa vidheyak rajyasabha main pesh kiya gaya
 He refused to issue a whip to party members to vote against the resolution and the bill and resigned
 sonia ke liye party ko ubaar paanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 He and his trusted Ahmed Patel will feel that they have gone through this experience before
 do dashak pehle, jab party seetaram kesari kii aguai main bikhar rahi thi, tab patel ne pantarebaaji ke dam par sonia ke haq main maahaul banaaya tha
 For the next 20 years, the party continued to work around them and did not allow any major breakdown
 bimariyon se jujh rahi 72 baras kii netaa hi congress kii aakhri ummid hai, yah shandaar viraasat se samrudh party ke liye koi shubh sanket nahin he
 Surya Namaskar will now be made an important part of education in Madhya Pradesh
 rajya ke skool va ucch shiksha mantri deepak joshi ke anusaar skulon main har shanivaar ko surya namaskara kiya jayega
 Deepak Joshi announced this on the occasion of National Youth Day
 unhone kaha ki hamaare skulon main har shanivaar ko bal sabha yojit kii jaati he, ham ismensurya namaskarabhi shaamil karenge kyonki isamen kul 12 yoga kriya shaamil hoti he
 Regarding whether Surya Namaskar would be compulsory for private schools, he said that Surya Namaskar and Yoga have always been optional but we want private schools to adopt it as well
 2007 main bijepi sarkaar ne sarkari skulon main surya namaskara, mantroccharan or pranayam ko anivaary bana diya tha
 When the opposition parties described this initiative as saffronisation of education, its inevitability was over

 com / fuujbvcn30— SONI (@ maheshs03969081) July 12, 2018 In the video which is going viral on social media, it is seen that three policemen gun taunts are positioned on the road, there is a crowd of people on both sides of the road
 And a group marching towards the police shouting slogans from the front
 tabhi teenon pulisavaale bandook ko sidhe bheed kii taraf karke goli chalaa dete hai or 2-3 logon ko goli lagati he or wo sadak par gir jate hai
 Smoke rises on the road and the crowd disperses
 iske baad kuch pulisavaale aage badhate hai or peeche se ek ambulance bhi aati he
 The policeman takes the injured people in an ambulance by loading them on a stretcher
 video aisa he ki jise dekhakar kisi kaa bhi dil dahal jaae
 This video clip of just one minute is being viral on social media at the moment and this video is being described as a shootout in Mandsaur district and it is being said that the farmers were struggling for their demands but The police put him straight to death
 mandsaur golicond main hui thi 5 kisaanon kii mautabta den ki madhya pradesh ke mandsaur main ek saal pehle jo golicond hua tha vah kaaphi charchaa main rahaa tha or usamen 5 kisaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 There was a lot of discussion about this incident and the BJP had to face a lot of trouble about it, but is this viral video really of the Mandsaur shootout in Madhya Pradesh? Watching this video carefully, some things are clear on its own She goes
 pehali baat to yah dikhti he ki police jab goli chalaa rahi he us vakt bhi sadak ke donon taraf log bilkul aaraam se khadey hai
 Even after firing and falling people, the crowd does not appear to be running away as it usually does
 yah bhi saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki goli chalaane ke baad dhuaan bandook kii naal se nahin balki aasapaas se uth rahaa he
 The voice that came with it is not like a bullet, but it looks like a cracker
 ye he viral video kii hakikatpulisavaale jab goli chalaakar khadey ho jate hai uske baad bhi ek dhamaakaa hota he or sadak par dhuaan uthta dikhataa he jise yah saaf he ki vah pataakhaa he
 It is also surprising that immediately after people fall, an ambulance reaches there and people run with a stretcher, as if they are already deployed on the spot
 in sari baton ko dekhte hue yah baat to saaf ho jaati he ki yah police kii asal firing nahin balki mock drill he jo police aksar logon main jaagarukta failaane ke liye chalaati he
 To test the truth of this, 'aaj Tak' contacted his correspondent in Mandsaur, he said that the place where the Mandsaur firing took place had no market but farms
 mandsaur goli cond jahaan par hua tha wo ek gaanv tha jabaki is video main saaf dekha ja saktaa he ki yah kisi shahar kaa bazaar he jahaan par donon taraf bank, showrooms or hotel dikh rahe hai
 It is very clear from this that this is not a video of Mandsaur at all
 mandsaur nahin khunti kaa he videolekin police firing kaa yah video he kahaan kaa he isaki padtaal karne ke liye hamane is video main dikh rahe tamaam showrooms or dukaanon ke aadhaar par khojbin shuru kii, jiske baad hamen yah pataa chalaa yah video jharkhand ke khunti shahar kaa he
 On October 31 last year in Khunti, the police conducted a mock drill about the preparedness of the police to deal with the riot
 khunti ke adhikariyon ne is baat kii pushti kii
 We asked for a video of the same road from Khunti from our correspondent to confirm this
 is video ko dekhakar yah baat saaf ho gai kii police kii mock drill khunti kii isi sadak par hui he jiskaa naam khunti main road he

 In front of their strength, big leaders of all political parties bow to Sir
 chunaav aaenge to deraa ke chakkar phir lagane jaaenge
 Pictures of several leaders with Gurmeet Singh Ram Rahim are trending on Twitter and social media
 mukhyamantri khatter to unke saath swatchta abhiyaan ke tahat jhaadu laga rahe hai
 While the crowd was setting fire to the media's OB van, the police stood there quietly
 sarkari daftaron ke saamne khadi kai obi vine ko samarthakon ne palat diya or vine jala deen
 The OB van of NDTV was also completely burnt and the engineer's leg was broken
 udhar, sirsa main pitisi channel ke reporter or cameraman par samarthakon ne hamalaa kar diya
 He broke his hand and the associate cameraman went missing
 whatrup, internet sevaayen band thim iske baad bhi media ne kisi tarah tasviren aap tak pahunchaa deen
 But think what pictures may not have reached you
 panchkula main logon ne patrakaron ko ghar main ghusane nahin diya
 The deployment of army, paramilitary force and police force was of no avail
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter shanti kii apil karte rahe jaise holi-diwaali ke samay shanti or sadbhaavna banaae rakhane kii apil kii jaati he
 At the time of the Jat agitation of February 2016, a similar crowd had become uncontrollable
 uske baad prakaash singh kii adhyakshata main ek report bhi jamaa hui lekin karrwai ke naam par khanaapurti hui
 If you read this report, you will be able to understand today's violence better
 aap dekh paaenge ki kyon police or ardhsainik balon kii tainaati ke baad bhi bheed apane man kaa kar leti he
 At the time of the Jat agitation, 1,196 shops were burnt in Haryana
 371 gaadiyaan phoonk di gayi
 53 marriage palaces and hotels were burnt down
 23 petrol pump ko nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya
 29 police stations and posts were also attacked
 prakaash singh cameti kii report ke anusaar us vakt haryana main 7,232 ped kaat daale gaye the taaki raaston ko blaak kiya ja sake
 This photo of February 2016 is no different from the photo of August 2017
 prakaash singh ne apni report main kaha he ki rohtak zile main 6,332 suraksha balon kii tainaati ke baad bhi hinsa ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 The deployment of security forces in the state was sufficient but the will power to take action is not visible
 prakaash singh ne likhaa he ki kai staron par netritv hi nahin tha
 Some officers fled from duty
 kuch ne duty par hote hue bhi kuch nahin kiya
 There was a group of officers who were practicing the loyalty of their caste, not the loyalty of the law
 in logon ne dangaiyon ko hinsa karne kii chhot di
 Prakash Singh has written that the Haryana Police charged lathi at 11 places but no one was injured
 prakaash singh tanj karte hai ki lathi charge bhi kaaphi ahimsak ho gai he
 He has said that there were 20 firing incidents in which 9 people were killed
 rohtak main 9 baar firing hui magar koi nahin mara
 It is clear that the administration was divided into castes and was saving the rioters
 prakaash singh ne apni report main likhaa he ki pichley ek dashak main haryana police ne force kaa hi istamaal nahin kiya he
 She has forgotten to use force
 aakhir us sarkaar kii police ke afasar kiske bharose ection len, jiske mukhiya se lekar mantri tak sab deraa main haaziri lagaate hon
 But before the matter becomes known, let us know about the two Sadhvis who testified for 15-16 years, fought against all the pressures
 aaj kii hinsa ke str se aap samaj gaye honge ki un ladakiyon par kya guzari hogi
 Journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, who took out a newspaper named 'poor Sach', printed the full truth of the dera and the anonymous letter in his newspaper which had written about rape and sexual violence of two sadhvis
 yah gumnaam patr us vakt ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bheja gaya tha
 Shortly after printing, Chhatrapati ji was attacked and killed
 do sadhviyon ke bhai ranjit kii bhi hatya ho gai
 a journalist died for the truth
 kya aap kisi bhi netaa ko jaanate hai jo vot lene ke liye deraa main jane se pehle chhatrapati kii ladaai main saath dene ke liye gaya ho
 We spoke to Chhatrapati's son Anshul Chhatrapati, who is very concerned about his safety at the moment
 ram chander chhatrapati, ek hansata muskuraataa saahasik patrkaar bich shahar main maar diya gaya
 Anshul said that once he decided to fight and came out of the house, many good people met on the way
 lekharaj dhont, ashvini bakshi, ares cheema or raajen sachhar jaise vakeelon ne bina paise ke cese ladaa
 Even with all the pressures, we and the Sadhvi's side supported
 yahi nahin sibiai ke jabanz dspi satish dagar na hote to yah cese apane mukaam par nahin pahunch paata
 Satish Dagar prepared the Sadhvis mentally
 ek ladki kaa sasuraal deraa kaa samarthak tha, jab use pataa chalaa ki usne gavaahi di ho to ghar se nikaal diya
 Even after this, the girls continued to face all kinds of pressures and the fear of the crowd
 satish dagar nahin hote ye log khauf kaa saamana nahin kar pate
 Anshul said that there was a lot of pressure on Satish Dagar but he did not bow down
 bade-bade ipies aisi himmat nahin juta pate hai magar dspi satish dagar ne kamaal kaa saahas dikhaaya he
 Anshul told that earlier the CBI court from Panchkula was in Ambala
 jab ye log vahaan sunwaayee ke liye jate the tab vahaan bhi baba ke samarthakon kii bheed aatank paidaa kar detii thi
 The condition became that on the day when the hearing was held and Baba was produced, on that day a temporary court was made in the sp's office within the Ambala police line
 chhavnee ke baahar samarthakon kaa hujum hota tha
 In such a situation, those two sadhwis testified and stood firm, not an easy thing against the Baba whom big leaders of Congress, Amit Shah of BJP, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Cabinet of Haryana used to go to salute there
 jabaki ye netaa mahilaon kii suraksha ke naam par chunaav ladate hai
 Did he support the Sadhvi? tippaniyan How to wrap a 15-year story in ten minutes
 bahut lambii he
 Anshul's condition is that a gunman was found
 puure rajya main itani tainaati ho gai magar kisi ko khyaal nahin aayaa ki anshul chhatrapati ke ghar kii suraksha badha di jaae
 Also met the police but did not get results
 faisla aane ke baad jab media ne baat uthaai to ab unke ghar ke baahar kuch surakshakarmi tainaat hai
 Later, when the CBI court shifted to Panchkula, Anshul Chhatrapati traveled with a gunman, traveling 250 km from Sirsa to Panchkula and Gurmeet Singh Ram Rahim testified through video conferencing in the same Sirsa court
 ye he aam aadmi kii haalat
 If the punjab-haryana High Court had no order today, you would have nothing to believe that the government is strictly dealing with this mob on violence
 hoicourt kii tippanee bhi kam sakht nahin he
 Who is responsible for this chaos? aapane khud hi logon ko ye sab karne diya he
 Why did you allow the crowd to gather in Panchkula
 ye afisar mookadarshak kyon bane hue hai
 You are helping them yourself
 unke samarthak paidal hi aa rahe hai or pakad bhi nahin paa rahe hai
 The same happened during the Jat movement
 jab tak aadesh paas hua, nuksaan ho chukaa tha
 Is Panchkula a part of India
 yah tak puch diya adaalat ne
 The court also pulled up the central government and said that we hope that you will come forward and help the people of Panchkula
 yaa phir kahie ki panchkula bharat kaa hissaa he yaa nahin
 The High Court's comment was growing from harsh to harsh
 punjab-haryana hoicourt ne kaha ki deraa sachcha sauda kii sampatti zabt kii jaae
 To compensate the loss from that
 lekin rajya ke mukhya sachiv kehete rahe ki nuksaan kii bharpai sarkaar karegi
 While the crowd was setting fire to the media's OB van, the police stood there quietly
 sarkari daftaron ke saamne khadi kai obi vine ko samarthakon ne palat diya or vine jala deen
 The OB van of NDTV was also completely burnt and the engineer's leg was broken
 udhar, sirsa main pitisi channel ke reporter or cameraman par samarthakon ne hamalaa kar diya
 He broke his hand and the associate cameraman went missing
 whatrup, internet sevaayen band thim iske baad bhi media ne kisi tarah tasviren aap tak pahunchaa deen
 But think what pictures may not have reached you
 panchkula main logon ne patrakaron ko ghar main ghusane nahin diya
 The deployment of army, paramilitary force and police force was of no avail
 mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter shanti kii apil karte rahe jaise holi-diwaali ke samay shanti or sadbhaavna banaae rakhane kii apil kii jaati he
 At the time of the Jat agitation of February 2016, a similar crowd had become uncontrollable
 uske baad prakaash singh kii adhyakshata main ek report bhi jamaa hui lekin karrwai ke naam par khanaapurti hui
 If you read this report, you will be able to understand today's violence better
 aap dekh paaenge ki kyon police or ardhsainik balon kii tainaati ke baad bhi bheed apane man kaa kar leti he
 At the time of the Jat agitation, 1,196 shops were burnt in Haryana
 371 gaadiyaan phoonk di gayi
 53 marriage palaces and hotels were burnt down
 23 petrol pump ko nuksaan pahunchaaya gaya
 29 police stations and posts were also attacked
 prakaash singh cameti kii report ke anusaar us vakt haryana main 7,232 ped kaat daale gaye the taaki raaston ko blaak kiya ja sake
 This photo of February 2016 is no different from the photo of August 2017
 prakaash singh ne apni report main kaha he ki rohtak zile main 6,332 suraksha balon kii tainaati ke baad bhi hinsa ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 The deployment of security forces in the state was sufficient but the will power to take action is not visible
 prakaash singh ne likhaa he ki kai staron par netritv hi nahin tha
 Some officers fled from duty
 kuch ne duty par hote hue bhi kuch nahin kiya
 There was a group of officers who were practicing the loyalty of their caste, not the loyalty of the law
 in logon ne dangaiyon ko hinsa karne kii chhot di
 Prakash Singh has written that the Haryana Police charged lathi at 11 places but no one was injured
 prakaash singh tanj karte hai ki lathi charge bhi kaaphi ahimsak ho gai he
 He has said that there were 20 firing incidents in which 9 people were killed
 rohtak main 9 baar firing hui magar koi nahin mara
 It is clear that the administration was divided into castes and was saving the rioters
 prakaash singh ne apni report main likhaa he ki pichley ek dashak main haryana police ne force kaa hi istamaal nahin kiya he
 She has forgotten to use force
 aakhir us sarkaar kii police ke afasar kiske bharose ection len, jiske mukhiya se lekar mantri tak sab deraa main haaziri lagaate hon
 But before the matter becomes known, let us know about the two Sadhvis who testified for 15-16 years, fought against all the pressures
 aaj kii hinsa ke str se aap samaj gaye honge ki un ladakiyon par kya guzari hogi
 Journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, who took out a newspaper named 'poor Sach', printed the full truth of the dera and the anonymous letter in his newspaper which had written about rape and sexual violence of two sadhvis
 yah gumnaam patr us vakt ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bheja gaya tha
 Shortly after printing, Chhatrapati ji was attacked and killed
 do sadhviyon ke bhai ranjit kii bhi hatya ho gai
 a journalist died for the truth
 kya aap kisi bhi netaa ko jaanate hai jo vot lene ke liye deraa main jane se pehle chhatrapati kii ladaai main saath dene ke liye gaya ho
 We spoke to Chhatrapati's son Anshul Chhatrapati, who is very concerned about his safety at the moment
 ram chander chhatrapati, ek hansata muskuraataa saahasik patrkaar bich shahar main maar diya gaya
 Anshul said that once he decided to fight and came out of the house, many good people met on the way
 lekharaj dhont, ashvini bakshi, ares cheema or raajen sachhar jaise vakeelon ne bina paise ke cese ladaa
 Even with all the pressures, we and the Sadhvi's side supported
 yahi nahin sibiai ke jabanz dspi satish dagar na hote to yah cese apane mukaam par nahin pahunch paata
 Satish Dagar prepared the Sadhvis mentally
 ek ladki kaa sasuraal deraa kaa samarthak tha, jab use pataa chalaa ki usne gavaahi di ho to ghar se nikaal diya
 Even after this, the girls continued to face all kinds of pressures and the fear of the crowd
 satish dagar nahin hote ye log khauf kaa saamana nahin kar pate
 Anshul said that there was a lot of pressure on Satish Dagar but he did not bow down
 bade-bade ipies aisi himmat nahin juta pate hai magar dspi satish dagar ne kamaal kaa saahas dikhaaya he
 Anshul told that earlier the CBI court from Panchkula was in Ambala
 jab ye log vahaan sunwaayee ke liye jate the tab vahaan bhi baba ke samarthakon kii bheed aatank paidaa kar detii thi
 The condition became that on the day when the hearing was held and Baba was produced, on that day a temporary court was made in the sp's office within the Ambala police line
 chhavnee ke baahar samarthakon kaa hujum hota tha
 In such a situation, those two sadhwis testified and stood firm, not an easy thing against the Baba whom big leaders of Congress, Amit Shah of BJP, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Cabinet of Haryana used to go to salute there
 jabaki ye netaa mahilaon kii suraksha ke naam par chunaav ladate hai
 Did he support the Sadhvi? tippaniyan How to wrap a 15-year story in ten minutes
 bahut lambii he
 Anshul's condition is that a gunman was found
 puure rajya main itani tainaati ho gai magar kisi ko khyaal nahin aayaa ki anshul chhatrapati ke ghar kii suraksha badha di jaae

 To compensate the loss from that
 lekin rajya ke mukhya sachiv kehete rahe ki nuksaan kii bharpai sarkaar karegi
 Prakash Singh has written that there was no leadership at all levels
 kuch afasar duty se hi bhaag gaye
 Some did nothing while on duty
 afasaron kaa samooh aisa tha jo apni jati kii vafadari nibhaa rahe the, kanoon kii vafadari nahin nibhaa rahe the
 These people allowed the rioters to commit violence
 prakaash singh ne likhaa he ki haryana police ne 11 jagahon par lathi charge kii magar koi ghayal nahin hua
 Prakash Singh points out that the lathi charge has also become quite non-violent
 unhone bataaya he ki firing kii 20 ghatana huin jisamen 9 log maare gaye
 There was 9 firing in Rohtak but no one died
 saaf he ki prashasan jatiyon main bant gaya tha or dangaiyon ko bachaa rahaa tha
 Prakash Singh has written in his report that the Haryana Police has not used force in the last decade
 wo bhul gai he force kaa istamaal karnaa
 After all, on whom should the police officers of that government take action, from whose head to the minister, everyone should attend the camp
 lekin iske pehle ki baat anijani ho jaae un do sadhviyon ke bare main jaan len jinhone 15-16 saal tak gavaahi di, tamaam dabaavon ke bich ladaa
 From today's level of violence you must have understood what will happen to those girls
 'puraa sach' naam kaa akhbaar nikaale vaale patrkaar ram chander chhatrapati ne deraa kaa puraa sach or us gumnaam patr ko apane akhbaar main chhap diya jisamen do sadhviyon ke saath balaatkaar or yon hinsa kii baat likhi thi
 This anonymous letter was sent to the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 chhapane ke kuch hi samay ke bheetar chhatrapati ji par hamalaa hua or unki maut ho gai
 Ranjith, the brother of two sages, was also killed
 ek patrkaar ne sach ke liye jaan de di
 Do you know any leader who went to join the battle of Chhatrapati before going to the Dera to get votes
 hamane chhatrapati ke putr anshul chhatrapati se baat kii jo is vakt apni suraksha ko lekar kaaphi chintit hai
 Ram Chander Chhatrapati, a laughing smiling adventure journalist was killed in the beach town
 anshul ne bataaya ki ek baar jab ladane kaa faisla kar ghar se nikle to raste main bahut se achche log mili
 Lawyers like Lekhraj Dhont, Ashwini Bakshi, RS Cheema and Rajen Sachar fought the case without money
 tamaam dabaavon ke baad bhi hamaara or sadhvio kaa hi saath diya
 Not only this, if the CBI had no DSP Satish Dagar, this case would not have reached its mark
 satish dagar ne hi sadhviyon ko maansik rup se taiyaar kiya
 a girl's in-law was a supporter of Dera, who was expelled from the house when she came to know that she had testified
 iske baad bhi ladkiyaan tamaam tarah ke dabaavon or bheed ke khauf kaa saamana karti raheen
 Satish is not a dagger, these people are not able to face the fear
 anshul ne bataaya ki satish dagar par bhi bahut dabaav padaa magar ve nahin jhuke
 Big IPS are unable to muster such courage but DSP Satish Dagar has shown amazing courage
 anshul ne bataaya ki pehle panchkula se sibiai kii court ambala main thi
 When these people used to go there for hearing, the crowd of Baba's supporters used to create terror there
 haalat yah ho gai ki jis din sunwaayee hoti thi or baba kii peshi hoti thi us din ambala police line ke bheetar espi ke aphis main asthaayee court banaaya jaataa tha
 Outside the camp, supporters gathered
 aisi haalat main un do sadhviyon ne gavaahi di or dati raheen, aasaan baat nahin us baba ke khilaaf jisase milane congress ke bade-bade netaa, bijepi ke amit shah, kailash vijayawargeey, haryana kii cabinet vahaan salaami dene jaati thim
 Whereas these leaders contest elections in the name of protection of women
 kya inhone sadhvi kaa saath diya
 The comments 15 saal kii kahani kaise samet den das minute main
 Is very long
 anshul kii haalat ye he ki ek ganman mila hua tha
 There was so much deployment across the state, but no one thought that the security of Anshul Chhatrapati's house should be increased
 police se mulaakaat bhi kii magar nateeja nahin niklaa
 After the decision, when the media raised the matter, some security personnel are now stationed outside their house
 baad main jab sibiai kii adaalat panchkula main shift hui to sirsa se panchkula 250 kimi kii yatra tay kar anshul chhatrapati ek ganman ke saath jate the or gurmeet singh ram rahim usee sirsa ke court main video conferencing se gavaahi dete the
 This is the condition of the common man
 aaj punjab-haryana hoicourt ke aadesh na hote to aapke paas yakeen karne ke laayak kuch nahin hota ki hinsa par utari is bheed se vaaki sarkaar sakhti se nipat rahi he
 The High Court's comment is no less strict
 is araajaktaa ke liye koun zimmedaar he
 You yourself have let people do all this
 aapane panchkula main bheed kyon jamaa hone di
 Why are these officers mute spectators? aap khud inaki madad kar rahe hai
 His supporters are coming on foot and are unable to catch up
 jat andolan ke samay bhi aisa hua tha
 By the time the order passed, the damage had been done
 kya panchkula bharat kaa hissaa he
 The court even asked this
 adaalat ne centre sarkaar kii bhi khinchaai kar di or kaha ki ham ummid karte hai ki aap aage aakar panchkula ke logon kii madad karenge
 Or say whether Panchkula is a part of India or not
 hoicourt kii tippanee kathor se kathortam hoti ja rahi thi
 The punjab-haryana High Court said that the assets of Dera Sacha Sauda be confiscated
 usase nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaae
 But the chief secretary of the state kept saying that the government would compensate for the loss
 prakaash singh ne apni report main likhaa he ki pichley ek dashak main haryana police ne force kaa hi istamaal nahin kiya he
 She has forgotten to use force
 aakhir us sarkaar kii police ke afasar kiske bharose ection len, jiske mukhiya se lekar mantri tak sab deraa main haaziri lagaate hon
 But before the matter becomes known, let us know about the two Sadhvis who testified for 15-16 years, fought against all the pressures
 aaj kii hinsa ke str se aap samaj gaye honge ki un ladakiyon par kya guzari hogi
 Journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, who took out a newspaper named 'poor Sach', printed the full truth of the dera and the anonymous letter in his newspaper which had written about rape and sexual violence of two sadhvis
 yah gumnaam patr us vakt ke pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko bheja gaya tha
 Shortly after printing, Chhatrapati ji was attacked and killed
 do sadhviyon ke bhai ranjit kii bhi hatya ho gai

 Ram Chander Chhatrapati, a laughing smiling adventure journalist was killed in the beach town
 anshul ne bataaya ki ek baar jab ladane kaa faisla kar ghar se nikle to raste main bahut se achche log mili
 Lawyers like Lekhraj Dhont, Ashwini Bakshi, RS Cheema and Rajen Sachar fought the case without money
 tamaam dabaavon ke baad bhi hamaara or sadhvio kaa hi saath diya
 Not only this, if the CBI had no DSP Satish Dagar, this case would not have reached its mark
 satish dagar ne hi sadhviyon ko maansik rup se taiyaar kiya
 a girl's in-law was a supporter of Dera, who was expelled from the house when she came to know that she had testified
 iske baad bhi ladkiyaan tamaam tarah ke dabaavon or bheed ke khauf kaa saamana karti raheen
 Satish is not a dagger, these people are not able to face the fear
 anshul ne bataaya ki satish dagar par bhi bahut dabaav padaa magar ve nahin jhuke
 Big IPS are unable to muster such courage but DSP Satish Dagar has shown amazing courage
 anshul ne bataaya ki pehle panchkula se sibiai kii court ambala main thi
 When these people used to go there for hearing, the crowd of Baba's supporters used to create terror there
 haalat yah ho gai ki jis din sunwaayee hoti thi or baba kii peshi hoti thi us din ambala police line ke bheetar espi ke aphis main asthaayee court banaaya jaataa tha
 Outside the camp, supporters gathered
 aisi haalat main un do sadhviyon ne gavaahi di or dati raheen, aasaan baat nahin us baba ke khilaaf jisase milane congress ke bade-bade netaa, bijepi ke amit shah, kailash vijayawargeey, haryana kii cabinet vahaan salaami dene jaati thim
 Whereas these leaders contest elections in the name of protection of women
 kya inhone sadhvi kaa saath diya
 The comments 15 saal kii kahani kaise samet den das minute main
 Is very long
 anshul kii haalat ye he ki ek ganman mila hua tha
 There was so much deployment across the state, but no one thought that the security of Anshul Chhatrapati's house should be increased
 police se mulaakaat bhi kii magar nateeja nahin niklaa
 After the decision, when the media raised the matter, some security personnel are now stationed outside their house
 baad main jab sibiai kii adaalat panchkula main shift hui to sirsa se panchkula 250 kimi kii yatra tay kar anshul chhatrapati ek ganman ke saath jate the or gurmeet singh ram rahim usee sirsa ke court main video conferencing se gavaahi dete the

 You yourself have let people do all this
 aapane panchkula main bheed kyon jamaa hone di
 Why are these officers mute spectators? aap khud inaki madad kar rahe hai
 His supporters are coming on foot and are unable to catch up
 jat andolan ke samay bhi aisa hua tha
 By the time the order passed, the damage had been done
 kya panchkula bharat kaa hissaa he
 The court even asked this
 adaalat ne centre sarkaar kii bhi khinchaai kar di or kaha ki ham ummid karte hai ki aap aage aakar panchkula ke logon kii madad karenge
 Or say whether Panchkula is a part of India or not
 hoicourt kii tippanee kathor se kathortam hoti ja rahi thi
 The punjab-haryana High Court said that the assets of Dera Sacha Sauda be confiscated
 usase nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaae

 Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission (UPPSC) PCS Mains Exam Canceled Hindi Examination will now be conducted on 7 July
 ayog ne galat paper baante jane ke baad yah faisla liya tha or hindi ke saath nimbadh kaa paper bhi radd kar diya tha

 lakhanu or elahabaad ke pariksha kendron par pariksha kaa aayojan karavaaya jayega

 ayog mens pariksha kaa aayojan 18 june se saat july ke bich ho rahaa he
 UPPCS Mains: Dissertation paper replaced in Hindi, examinations canceled after the ruckus According to the examination centers where the wrong papers were distributed, there was pressure from the candidates to write an essay paper instead of Hindi paper, While other examination centers conducted the examination smoothly

 Politics is nothing new in Madhya Pradesh about cows
 beete vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi or congress ne votaron ko lubhaane ke liye kai tarah kii ghoshnaaen kii thi
 But now the Mayor of Bhopal has taken a unique decision regarding cows
 unhone marane vaali gaayon ke antim sanskaar ke liye bhopal main muktidhaam banane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 After his announcement, Bhopal will be the first city in the country where Muktidham will be specially built for the last rites of cows
 baat den ki bhopal ke mahayor alok sharma bijepi se hai
 Alok Sharma said about his decision that if the cow gives milk then it is worshiped, when it stops, the stray people start saying
 aise main nagar nigam ne praavdhaan kiya tha ki bajet main gau muktidhaam bane jaise hi jagah milegi gau mukti dham banaaenge
 The BJP is in control of the Bhopal Municipal Corporation
 gauratlab he ki congress ne apane ghoshnaa patr main rajya kii har panchayat main gaushala kholane kaa vaayada kiya tha
 Now the party is saying that before Muktidham it is necessary to transport cows roaming on the road
 congress pravaktaa maanak agarwal ne kaha gau mukti dham banane kii baat kah rahe hai, lekin pehle jo gaayen sadak par pade hai unhen gaushala tak pahunchaae
 According to government figures, the total number of cattle in the state is 2
 27 karod he, jinamein 90 lakh dudharu hai
 Of these 54 lakhs are only cows
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle madhyapradesh main gaayon ke liye ambulance seva chalaane kaa faisla kiya gaya tha
 During that time, the government had to face severe criticism from the general public for this
 aam logon kaa kahana tha ki rajya main marijon or ghayalon ke liye to ambulance mil nahin paati he or sarkaar gaayon ke liye ambulance seva shuru karne kii taiyaari main he
 Remember that the government had sent a proposal to the Mandi Board for this
 is yojana ke shuruaati charan main teen jilon main ambulance seva chalaane kii baat kahi gai thi
 In the battle of Rajasthan, Rahul Gandhi has given a political hunk
 guuruuvaar ko rajasthan daure par gayi rahul gandhi ne mahila congress ko kota main sambodhit kiya
 At a Women's Congress event in Kota, Rajasthan, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said, "A legislator from Uttar Pradesh raped a woman, but the Prime Minister kept quiet
 
 
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri ne ek shabd bhi nahin kaha
 
 
 The Prime Minister gave a good slogan in favor of women, but when it came time to do something, he did nothing
 
 
 " Rahul Gandhi said that the Women's Congress overtook us

 Women Congress workers have left all the Congress wings behind

 While addressing the Mahila Congress, Rahul Gandhi said that the Prime Minister removed the CBI chief because the agency was going to start the process of investigating the deal
 unhone kaha, ‘sibiai rafel saude main jaanch kii apni prakriya shuru karne vaali thi jisase pradhanmantri dar gaye or unhone sibiai pramukh ko hataa diya
 He alleged that the Prime Minister changed the tender of the Rafale deal without consulting the Ministry of Defense

 The CBI was about to initiate the investigation and the Prime Minister was scared, worried that the milk of milk would turn into water when the CBI investigation started

 With this, Rahul stressed on increasing the participation of women in the Congress

 jammu kashmir ke pulavama main beete guuruuvaar ko hue aatanki hamale ne desh ko jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 At this time, there is an atmosphere of grief and anger in the city and people want the government to take strict action against those responsible for this dastardly attack
 saath hi aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad or unke panaahagaah pakistan ke khilaaf bhi kathor kadam uthaae jaaen
 After the attack, all the political parties of the country condemned it and said to stand shoulder to shoulder with the government in the fight against terror
 sattadhari dal bijepi or pradhanmantri narendra modi janata ko lagaataar bharosa dilaa rahe hai ki hamale ke peeche jo bhi takatein hai unase badla liya jayega
 But this time, like a surgical strike, neither any opposition party questioned the government nor tried to surround the government by raising the issue of security lapses
 pulavama hamale ke baad mukhya vipaksh congress samet anya dal bhi sarkaar ke saath khadey dikhe
 Even the Congress postponed its two big political programs after the attack
 lekin vipaksh kii is chuppi kii vajah bhi he, kyonki vah is najuk vakt main bijepi ko koi mudda nahin dena chaahate or chunaav se pehle desh ke liye ekajutata bhi dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 Lessons from the surgical strike: Many opposition parties, including Congress and Aam Aadmi Party, questioned the government's move after the surgical strike, which had to bear the brunt of these parties
 bijepi ke netaaon ne sargical strike par sawaal uthaane vaale netaaon ko apni chunavi reliyon main jamkar kosa
 At the same time, it was also an insult to the valor and might of the army
 iske baad sarkaar ke is kadam par sawaal uthaane vaale ulte sawaalon ke ghere main aa gaye
 Now no opposition parties want to repeat such mistake before the election so that before the Lok Sabha elections, their image will become that of the anti-national party, because if the BJP promotes it then it can have an impact in the Lok Sabha elections
 javaanon kii shahadat kaa gussajammu kashmir main aae din encounter or sijafire ulanghan kii ghatnaayen hoti hai, jinamein hamaare javaanon kii shahadat hui he
 But this time the terrorists have carried out a major attack in which 40 CRPF personnel have been martyred together
 aatankiyon kii is kyrana harakat se desh sadame main he
 In such a situation, the opposition parties are avoiding any kind of political attack on the government while respecting public sentiments
 aam taur par javaanon kii shahadat par sarkaar ko aade haathon lene vaale vipakshi dal is bade aatanki hamale ke baad bane aakrosh ke maahaul se avgat hai
 Now if any party makes political statements on this, then it will have to bear the anger of the martyrdom of the soldiers
 bijepi ko na den siyaasi hathiyaarapradhanmantri narendra modi chunavi jansabhaon main hamale kaa badla lene ke bayaan lagaataar de rahe hai
 Apart from this, BJP President Amit Shah has been targeting the Congress by calling the former UPA a forced government
 agar is vakt koi bhi vipakshi dal sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish karegaa to yah daanv ulta pad saktaa he kyonki bijepi use mudda bana legi or vahi bayaan chunavi reliyaan kaa agenda sat karne kaa kaam karenge
 In the past, the statements of opposition leaders have been made an election issue from the Prime Minister to all the big leaders of the BJP
 aise main koi dal nahin chahega ki bijepi ko pulavama hamale ke baad koi siyaasi hathiyaar diya jaae
 Solidarity against terror: The government has shown the greatest military action of its tenure through surgical strikes
 centre sarkaar shuru se hi aatank ke khilaaf jiro tolerance kii niti apana rahi he
 In such a situation, the opposition leaders want to send a message through the silence that in this big fight, they are standing with the government
 saath hi vaishvik str par bhi duniya ko aisi ekajutana dikhaane kii jarurat he
 Whether it is a relationship with the neighboring country of Pakistan or diplomatically attempts to isolate Pakistan, in all these, the opposition parties want to stand with the government
 chuppi main chupa chalanjavipakshi dalon kii is chuppi main modi sarkaar ke liye ek chunauti bhi chuphi hui he
 All the opposition leaders may not raise questions on the government yet, but they are repeating the demand for action on terrorism again and again
 tivi par congress ke netaa baar-baar 'ek ke badale 10 sir' vaale bayaan kii yaad bijepi ko dilaa rahe hai
 Apart from this, pressure is being made on the government to end all relations with Pakistan
 isi dabaav kaa nateeja tha ki centre sarkaar ne hamale ke agle hi din pakistan se MFN kaa darja waapas le liya
 Now there is a direct challenge to the government from the opposition parties that we are standing with you but you should take action against terrorism
 aaj ke maahaul main is chuppi ke kai siyaasi myne hai
 But as the election draws near, this silence of opposition parties will take the form of sharp attacks, because then the atmosphere will be different
 aaj chup rahane vaale netaa us vakt chunavi manchon se sarkaar se jawaab maangane ko taiyaar dikhenge, us vakt main sarkaar ko vipaksh ke sawaal kaa jawaab bhi dena padegaa or jameen kar ection ke jariye janata kaa bharosa bhi jeetna padegaa

 isse pehle karnataka main jab congress-jedies kii sarkaar thi to ye samaaroh kaaphi dhoomdhaam se manaaya jaataa tha
 Let us know that the issue of Tipu Jayanti has been hot in the state and BJP has often opposed it

 vat savitri vrath (vat Savitri Vrat) hindu dharm ko maanane vaali striyon ke liye behad khaas he
 It is believed that keeping this fast increases the distress faced by the husband and prolongs his life
 yahi nahin agar daanpaty jivan main koi pareshaani chal rahi ho to vah bhi is vrath ke pratap se dur ho jate hai
 Suhagin women pray for the long life of their husbands and happy marital life and worship on this day under Vat i
e
 Banyan tree
 is din savitri (savitri) or satyawan (satyavan) kii katha sunne kaa vidhaan he
 It is believed that by listening to this story one gets the desired fruit
 puranic katha ke anusaar savitri mrityu ke devtaa yamraj se apane pati satyawan ke praan waapas le ai thi
 Savitri was a girl with all the qualities, for which Savitri's father started grieving because of not getting a suitable groom
 ek baar unhone putree ko swayan var talashne bheja
 In this search, Savitri arrives in a forest where she meets the King of the Salve country, Dumatsen
 dyumtsen usee tapovana main rahete the kyonki unka rajya kisi ne chin liya tha
 Savitri, seeing her son Satyavan, selected her as her husband
 idhar, yah baat jab rishiraj naarad ko gyaat hui to ve ashwapati se jaakar kehane lage- aapaki kanya ne var khojane main baari bhul kii he
 Satyavan is virtuous and righteous but he is young and will die after one year
 naarad ji ke vachan sun raja ashwapati kaa cheharaa vivarna ho gaya
 Considering "vratha na hohin dev sage bani", he explained to his daughter that it is not appropriate to marry such a young person
 isliye anya koi var chun lo
 On this, Savitri tells her father that the father-arya girls remember their husband only once, and Kanyadaan is also done only once
 ab chaahe jo ho, main satyawan ko hi var rup main sweekaar kar chuki hum
 Hearing this, both of them were married with ritualistic rituals and Savitri got engaged in the service of mother-in-law as soon as she reached her in-law's house
 samay badla, naarad kaa vachan savitri ko din -pratidin adheer karne laga
 When she realized that the day of her husband's death had drawn near, then she started fasting from three days ago
 naarad dwaara kathith nishchit tithi par pitaron kaa pujan kiya
 As usual, Satyavan went to cut wood on his own time that day, Savitri also agreed to walk in the forest with her husband on the orders of her mother-in-law
 satyawan van main pahunchakar lakdi kaatane ke liye vriksh par chadh gaya
 Ascending the tree, Satyavan's head started suffering unbearable pain
 vah vyakul ho gaya or vriksh se neeche utar gaya
 Savitri understood her future and made her husband sit on her lap and lie down on her husband
 usee samay dakshin disha se atyant prabhaavshaalee mahisharudh yamraj ko aate dekha
 When Dharmaraj walked with Satyavan's life, Savitri also followed him
 pehle to yamraj ne use devi-vidhaan samajhaayaa parantu uski nishtha or patiparayanata dekh kar use var maangane ke liye kaha
 Savitri said- "my mother-in-law is a forest dweller and blind
 unhen aap divya jyoti pradaan karen
 "yamraj said," This will happen and now you go back
 " yamraj kii baat sunakar usne kaha, "bhagwaan mujhe apane patidev ke peeche-peeche chalane main koi pareshaani nahin he
 It is my duty to follow the husband
 " yah sunakar unhone phir se use ek or var maangane ke liye kaha
 Savitri said, "the kingdom of our father-in-law has been snatched away so that they can regain it, and also remain virtuous
 " yamraj ne yah var dekar kaha, "acha ab tum laut jaao parantu vah na maani
 "yamraj said that in addition to the life of the husband, ask for whatever you want and return
 is baar savitri ne apane ko satyawan ke sau putron kii maa banane kaa vardaan maanga
 Yamraj said Aastastu and went ahead
 savitri phir bhi unke peeche-peeche chalati rahi
 Yamraj gets angry with this act of his
 yamraj ko krodhit hote dekh savitri unhen naman karte hue unhen kahati he, "aapane mujhe sau putron kii maa banane kaa aashirwad to de diya lekin bina pati ke main maa kis prakaar se ban sakati hum, isaliye aap apane tisare vardaan ko puraa karne ke liye apana kaha puraa karen
 "yamraj, knowing Savitri's husband's religion, freed Satyavan's life from his loop
 savitri satyawan ke praan lekar vat vriksh ke neeche pahunchi or satyawan jivit hokar uth baithe
 Both of them cheered and walked towards their capital
 vahaan pahunch kar unhone dekha ki unke mata-pita ko divya jyoti praapt ho gai he
 In this way savitri-satyavan continued to enjoy state happiness for a long time
 manyata he ki vat savitri vrath karne or isaki katha sunne se upaask ke vaivaahik jivan yaa jivan saathi kii aayu par kisi prakaar kaa koi sankat aayaa bhi ho to tal jaataa he

 vah apni ichchhaaon kaa izhaar karti he, unhen khulkar baahar aane detii he, or nattejey bhugatne ko taiyaar rahati he
 With her courage, she makes the man in bed stunned and speechless

 She has found her voice and is speaking openly from the urban area
 is tarah vah apane daravaaje band rakhane vaali duniya ko majaboor kar rahi he ki vah uske liye inhen khole
 Figures also exist
 apni tarah kaa akelaa, india today group-emdiare sex survey apana gyarahavaan sanskaran pesh kar rahaa he
 After a gap of ten years, this survey has again revealed various aspects of women's sex experiences
 survey main 19 shaharon ke kareeb 4,000 stri-purushon ke jawaab hamen striyon ke sex sambandhi rujhaanon par nae sire se sochane par majaboor karte hai
 The time has come to change the old, worn-out attitude
 stri-purush sex sambandhon ke maamle main hameshaa yahi mana jaataa rahaa he ki purush prakruti se hi kaamdev he jabaki striyon ko taiyaar karnaa padataa he
 But in our survey of this year, there is no longer a traditional distinction between men and women in bed: if 64 percent of men force their unwilling partner to have sex, 60 percent of women do the same
 doosraa paimaana sukh or anand uthaane kaa haih agar 91 fisadi purush sex ko behad aanandadaayak maanate hai to 90 fisadi auraten bhi aisa hi maanati hai
 In our 2003 survey, the number of women experiencing satisfaction in sex was just 54 percent
 dashak bhar pehle survey ke aankadon se ek nai unmukt stri kii halchal sunai padi thi, lekin vah apni ichchhaaon kaa khulkar izhaar karne main sankoch karti thi
 Her life was imprisoned in uneven conditions of marriage, she was prone to guilt and moral dilemmas
 us tanaav se ab ek nai, apana bhagya khud likhane vaali stri kaa janm hua, jo apni pasand ke kapade pahenti he, jab chaahati he, shaadi karti he or apni marji se maa banane kaa faisla karti he
 Unlike the 2003 suppressed housewife, today she wants to pursue education, workplaces and above all in her sex life
 sex sambandhon se lekar garbh nirodh, yahaan tak ki hastmaithun-har maamle main uski icchhaaen use nai manzil talashne kii ore prerit kar rahi hai
 Now, change is the only lasting sense: if only 8 percent of women were saying in 2003 that their bedroom was filled with new excitement every day, then there are now 18 percent of those making such claims
 agar 2003 main 64 fisadi auraton ne vivaah purv sex ko shnya kaha tha to unki sankhya sirf 50 fisadi rah gai he
 In 2003, 9 percent had accepted the habit of watching porn films, then their number is now 35 percent
 mardon main striyon ko kya sabase zyada aakarshith karata he, isamen badlaav aa gaya he
 In 2003, 28 percent of women considered that single aphrodisiac and natural organ to be stimulating, while now they have also aroused interest in their partner's other organs, with 25 percent considering men's thighs as "the most attractive"
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki das saal ke survey main pehali dfa stri or purush ek hi paaydaan par khadey najar aa rahe hai
 This belief has been completely broken that women get swept away in emotions and the male is attracted by the physical structure
 iske vipareet survey se yah pataa chalata he ki stri or purush donon hi kamobesh ek-duusare ke prati ek hi tarah kii vaasana se prerit hote hai
 When asked "is sex important to you?", 91 percent of men said "yes", and the same answer was 86 percent — 20 percent more than in 2003
 kya niyamit, kam-se-kam har hafte ek baar, sex karte hai? iske jawaab main striyon kii sankhya adhik thi yani 46 fisadi jabaki 42 fisadi purushon ne hi haa kaha
 Then they do not even need Kama Sutra to create excitement in their sex life: both men and women enjoy different positions and get satisfaction
 bedroom main ho rahi is khamosh kranti ko janm dene vaale kaarak koun se hai? sachaai yahi he ki striyon ke liye surakshit aarthik bhavishya ke saath santoshjanak rishte kaa behatar maahaul aaj jaisaa kabhi nahin tha
 Girls are overtaking boys in school exams
 ab adhikadhik mahilaayein ucch shiksha kii pratispardhaon main pravesh paa rahi hai
 More than 70 percent more women are getting admission in higher education than at the beginning of 21st century
 ujisi kii report ke mutabik 2000-01 ke mukaable ejineering main pravesh lene vaali chaatraon kii sankhya doguni ho gai he
 68% of the students are getting admission in Management and Commerce, 72% in Science and 89% in Medicine
 desh main skild stri or purushon main fark khatm hota ja rahaa he-shahari ilaakon main 16 fisadi purushon ke mukaable ab 14 fisadi skild striyaan hai-isliye rojgaar ke nae maukey bhi khul rahe haih sarvice sector se lekar bainkon tak main
 According to the 2013 Accenture Survey, women are happier in their positions in the workplace than male partners
 unhen yah ehsaas bhi he ki kaam ghar se kam mahatv kaa nahin he
 With the opening of new opportunities for education and employment, a new kind of agility has come in the private lives of women
 workaplace khel kaa nayaa maidan he
 Affair and romance cases with partners were limited to only 3 per cent of women in 2003
 2013 main 16 fisadi striyaan apane sahyogiyon ke saath, alpakaalik hi sahi, rishte banane ko taiyaar hai
 And it's not just girls
 2003 main maatr 3 fisadi ne naukari main tarakkee ke liye sex ko aadhaar banane kii baat kabuuli thi
 Now 17 per cent of women who have lost their jobs, consider it an easy way to go up fast to please their boss
 agar 16 fisadi purush apni mahila sahyogiyon kii khubsuurati kii tarif karke ishaare karte hai to 16 fisadi mahilaayein bhi aisa karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 So, have women gained sexual freedom and been able to behave like men? Women are definitely more independent than before
 pehle kii tarah khusur-phusur main mashgool rahane ke badale ab striyaan majboot ho gai hai
 More than 23 percent of the women surveyed did not talk about their sex lives
 iske vipareet 64 fisadi purush apane yon jivan ke bare main duusare purushon ke saath khusur-phusur karte hai or 13 fisadi hi nijee maamalon ko saarvajanik karne se bachate hai
 Not being happy with their relationship, more men (62 percent) discuss it than women, yet men form more extramarital relationships (12 percent)
 shant or santulit 20 fisadi mahilaayein rishton main khatas paidaa hone par kuch nahin karatin lekin 14 fisadi mahilaayein saathi ke bevafa hone par rishte tod detii hai
 Only 6 per cent of women dared to take such drastic measures in 2003
 purush kya aisi sthitiyon ke liye taiyaar hai? mushkil se
 They are accustomed to hold back old trends with modernity
 zyaadaatar purush apni auraton ko paaramparik veshbhusha main dekhnaa pasand karte hai, lekin un striyon se uttejit hote hai
 Who do "dirty things" in bed; Mostly spunky women weave and masturbate for them; Most believe that sex is their marital right, yet they accept physical relations to promote their partners
 2003 ke sex survey main aadhunik aurat kaa udai dikhaa tha, vah ‘‘apane jivan se adhik apni ichchhaaon par control’’ kaayam kar rahi thi
 In 2013, she has started to express her needs and desires openly
 isse bedroom or uske baahar spasht bhoomikaaon main baari ulat-pher se mardon ke liye samay mushkil ho saktaa he
 The epic Kama Sutra, which defines good life in India, considers religion, artha, kama necessary for material pleasures
 purush isamen duvidha main pad saktaa he kyonki duusari ore se achaanak use chunauti milane lagi he
 The Center on Monday defended the appointment of the controversial bureaucrat PJ Thomas as the Central Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) in a Kerala court facing corruption case, saying he was an outstanding officer with impeccable and honest image

 While Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Home Minister p Chidambaram have approved this appointment, Sushma Swaraj, the third member of the panel and Leader of the Opposition, has opposed Thomas's appointment due to his tainted image
 halafanama main kaha gaya he ki thomas kii niyukti main koi sanvaidhanik niyamon kaa ulanghan nahin kiya gaya tathaa pad ke liye unki yogyata kaa nirnay ucchtam nyaayalay ko nahin karnaa chahie
 It states, 'it is well known that the matter of eligibility for the post should be left to the discretion of the appointing authority
 yogyata par adaalat prashn khadey nahin kar sakati tathaa ise niyukti praadhikari par chhod diya janaa chahie
 According to the government, consensus is not required in a high-level committee, but a clean and honest image is definitely an essential element in all appointments but the appointment of any person is an aspect of eligibility

 jis paanch rupee main sirf thanda pani yaa garam chaay naseeb ho, usee daam main bharpayt khaane ke hotel kaa pataa thikaana mumbai ke bijepi netaa ashish selaar ne janhit main jari kar diya he
 Sailar said, "while expensive dishes are available to eat in Mumbai, on the other hand you can get a full meal for five rupees
 'dilli main modi sarkaar pyaaj chalisa kaa jaap kar rahi he to idhar mumbai main unke hi netaa paanch rupye main bharpayt khaane kaa chamatkaar dikhaa rahe hai
 When the statement of eating five rupees was reached in Delhi, political politics started deteriorating
 congress ke wo bayaan bhi siyaasi museum se nikaale jane lage, jo paanch paanch rupee main bharpayt khaane kaa adress bataa rahe the
 Raj Babbar of Congress had jokingly beaten seven rupees on inflation
 12 rupee main bharpayt khaane kaa tarjuba bhari mehfil main maje le lekar bataaya tha

 masalaa mumbai ke bajaay dilli kaa he, jahaan manmohan sarkaar ke mahange dinon main raashid masood ne paanch rupee main bharpoor thali kaa nuskhaa dilli waalon ko thama diya tha
 In a country where the price of potato onion and dal rice is touching the sky, the government is kneeling in front of inflation, where every day new installment of inflation is loaded on the head of the public, then what is the statement of eating a full meal for five rupees? And the scale of concern determines
 kya netaji paanch rupee main khud bharpayt khaane kii himmat dikhaa sakenge

 Chief Workshop Manager (NCR) Jhansi (UP) 284003 ravivaar dopaher ko khabar ai ki dilli ke aam aadmi party ke teen vidhayak goa chale gaye hai, jabaki party ko is bare main khabar nahin he
 This stirred up the party and media reporters immediately became active
 media ke reporters ke sakriy hone kaa kaaran yah tha ki party sutron ke mutabik, unhen is yatra ke bare main jaankaree nahin thi
 Along with this, he was also pointing out that Goa is a bjp-ruled state
 shraadh bas khatm hone hi vaale he or navaratri main ho saktaa he ki bijepi dilli main sarkaar bana rahi ho or aise main aap vidhayak tut rahe ho
 In the evening, as soon as the three mlas Dharmendra Koli from Seemapuri, Prakash Jarwal from Deoli and Ashok Chauhan from Ambedkar Nagar reached Goa airport, they started calling and came to know that there was news going on in the media, they immediately spoke to the party from the airport itself Decided to come back and return and meet party chief Arvind Kejriwal and present his side
 somvaar subah simpuri se aap vidhayak dharmendra coli ne kaha ki ve log pehle bhi is tarah ghoomane jate rahe hai
 The allegations accusing him of being in touch with the BJP are completely wrong
 vahiin devli se aap vidhayak prakaash jarwal kaa kahana tha ki unhone pehle hi party ko suchit kar diya tha
 Not only this, he said that when Congress or BJP leaders go somewhere to roam, then there is nothing but when you go to the MLA, news is made
 party ke netaa manish sisodiya ne kaha ye ek saazish kii tarah he, jisamen aap vidhayakon ko kamazor dikhaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he, kahin ghoomane janaa galat he kya? From the official statements, it seems that nothing has happened and everything is the result of media speculation
 lekin hakikat yahi he ki dhuna tabhi uthta he jab aag lagi ho yani party or uske vidhayakon main communication gap to rahaa hi
 At the same time it was also clear that the party did not trust the mlas as much as it is claimed

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter aapane shaadi samarohon main band baaja bajaate hue purushon ko to bahut dekha hoga lekin kya aapane kabhi kisi mahila ko band bajaate dekha he? nahin dekha to bihar ke danapur ke dhibra gaanv jaaen, kyonki yahaan kii mahilaon ne apana band taiyaar kiya he
 It was not an easy task for these women to form their own band, they had to listen to a lot of problems and taunts of society but they say 'where there is a will there is a way
 'mahilaon ko band banaakar swarozgaar kii prerana dene vaali padmashri sudhaa vargeez ne is bed ke sargam naam diya he
 And the women of this band play such a gamut of bad that their demand has started in other states as well
 danapur kaa dhibra gaanv jahaan kii mahadalit mahilaon ne yah sabit kar diya ki jahaan chaah hoti he vahaan koi raah mushkil nahin hoti
 Till yesterday, the women of this place are making themselves proud by creating their first female band, not only in Bihar but also outside Bihar
 yah mahilaayein bade-bade band baaje ko apane kandhon par uthaakar bajaati hai or kamaati hai
 Along with living a better life, the women of this band are also educating their children in good schools so that their future generations do not have to face poverty
 ek vakt tha jab in mahilaon ke paas khaane tak ke paise nahin the or inhen aarthik pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa tha
 One day, philanthropist Padma Shri Sudha Varghese, who runs Nari Gunjan, suggested her to form a women's band, after which the women were ready to learn and formed their own band called 'sargam Mahila Band'
 pehle gaanv kii 15 mahilaon neband sikhaanashuru kiya lekin ant main 10 mahilaayein hi ise sikh pain
 While teaching the band, he got to hear taunts from his home, family and society
 gaanv ke logon ne kaaphi khari-khoti bhi sunai, lekin in mahilaon ne haar nahin maani or aaj sikh kar izzat or paise ke saath-saath naam bhi kama rahi hai
 Women collectively earn ten thousand to twenty thousand every day by playing the band with their skills
 ab iskaa netritv gaanv kii hi beti savita devi apane gaanv ki 9 bhabhiyon ke saath bihar ke saath-saath duusare pradesh main bhi jaakar bhi logon kii khushi main chaar chand lagaati hai
 It was Sudha Varghese who inspired the women of Dhibra village to form a band party and learn the band
 sudhaa vargeez ne bataaya ki wo ek baar mangalore gai thim or vahiin par unhone mahilaon kaa band dekha tha or use dekhakar unhen bhi laga ki bihar kii garib mahilaon ko rojgaar dene ke liye band bajaanaa siikhnaa chahie taaki wo swabalambi ban saken
 What was it then? Sudha Varghese chose the village of Dhibra in Danapur and mobilized the poor Mahadalit women there to motivate them to learn the band and soon here the women with high spirits gave birth to the country's first 'sargam Mahila Band' 
 dekhte hi dekhte dhibra gaanv main mahadalit mahila band kaa taan shaadi samaaroh ke saath-saath raajnneeti partiyon ke kaaryakarmon main bhi aakarshan kaa centre ban gaya
 Today, this team of Mahadalit women are looting accolades by performing their bands in other states besides Bihar

 bhartiya vayusena kii air strike par sawaal uthaane or aatankiyon ke maare jane kii sankhya poochne waalon ko kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne karaara jawaab diya he
 Addressing a public meeting in Rajasthan, Rajnath said that the warrior who does not count the casualties
 isse pehle rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki bhartiya vayusena kaa nishaanaa kabhi chook nahin saktaa he
 Those who want to know the death toll of terrorists can go to Pakistan and count it
 shuukravaar ko vipakshi dalon par nishaanaa sadhate hue rajnath singh ne kaha ki are sankhya poochhate ho aap, kitne log maar gaye? sankhya poochne waalon se kahana chahta hum ki jo yudhvir hota he, wo maare gaye logon kii ginati nahin karata he
 When asked about the number of terrorists killed in Balakot, Pakistan, this statement of Rajnath Singh has come out
 isse pehle neshnal technical research orgenigeshan (NTRO) ke servilans se khulaasa hua ki bhartiya vayusena ke miraj ladaaku vimaanon ne jab pakistan ke balakot sthit jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki campon par hamalaa bolaa, us samay vahaan par 280 se zyada mobile phone active the
 Indian intelligence agencies also provided information about the presence of terrorists in jaish-e-mohammad's Balakot camps through satellite
 iske saath hi RAW ne bhi apni khufia report main balakot sthit jaish-e-mohammad ke campon main kaaphi sankhya main aatankiyon ke hone kii baat kahi thi
 Apart from this, Maulana Ammar, the brother of jaish-e-mohammed Masood Azhar, cried the destruction of the air strike of the Indian Air Force
 aatanki moulana ammaar kaa audio bhi saamne aayaa tha
 On the basis of all this, it is being claimed that more than 280 militants were present at the jaish-e-mohammed's camps during the air strike of the Indian Air Force
 aapako bataa den ki jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main siarpief par hue aatmghami hamale ke baad bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan main ghuskar air strike kii thi or balakot sthit jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki thikaanon par bambaari kii thi
 In this action of India, it is being said that there is heavy damage to terrorist bases
 vahiin, pakistan ko bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai kii jaankaree nahin ho pai thi
 When Pakistan came to know about this action of India, it was shocked
 iske baad usne bhartiya sainya thikaanon par hamalaa karne kii koshish kii, lekin bhartiya vayusena ne unki is manshaa ko naakaam kar diya
 During this time, Pakistan's F-16 fighter aircraft was shot down by the wing commander of the Indian Air Force
 hawaii bhidnt ke dauraan pakistani ladaaku vimaanon ko khaddate hue abhinandan pakistan ke hawaii kshetra main pahunch gaye the
 Meanwhile, Pakistan attacked his aircraft with a missile or air artillery, in which Abhinandan's mig-21 fighter aircraft fell into the occupied territory of Pakistan
 vahiin, mig-21 uda rahe wing commander abhinandan pakistan ke kabje vaale ilaake main pahunch gaye the, jahaan pakistani sena ne unako pakad liya tha
 However, Pakistan had to bow to the tough stand of India and Abhinandan had to be released

 com / cmejyxkmaa — Shankar Shanmugham (@shankarshanmugh) August 15, 2019 The film was to be discussed a long time ago some reports had reported that the Indian 2 film might be discontinued
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki diarector shankar or film ke nirmaataaon ke bich bajet lekar kuch anban ho gai thi
 For this reason, there is a problem shooting the film
 diarector or lika production ke bich film ke bajet ko lekar sahmati nahin ban paa rahi he
 However, this has not yet been officially confirmed
 iske pehle part yani indian main camel hasan ne dohari bhoomika nibhaai thi
 He appeared in both father and son characters

 In an interview, he told that he is quitting acting
 aisa wo politics ke chalate kar rahe hai
 They cannot do both work together and now want to focus only on politics
 isliye unhone aisa faisla liya
 For this reason, speculated like this

 This is England's fifth major victory over India in terms of runs
 james anderson or stuart broad ne bhartiya pari ko hilaakar rakh diya
 Anderson took five and Brad took three wickets, leading the world number one Indian team to 261 runs after chasing a difficult target of 458 runs
 bharat kii taraf se yuva suresh raina (78) or vivies lakshmana (56) hi kuch der tak sangharsh kar paae
 Sachin Tendulkar was expected to make a memorable 100th international century in this historic Test match but he was inexpensively limited in both innings
 england ne yah match jitkar chaar maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 1-0 kii badhat hasil kii
 Along with this, he also weakened the foundations of India's number one chair
 yadi vah is shrinkhalaa main do test ke antar se jeet darj karata he to phir vah bharat ke sthaan par number ek ban jayega

 haal hi main aatankwaad kii ek bilkul ek nai shakl saamne ai he
 By now you must have seen different faces of terrorists
 magar ab pehali baar sarhad paar se aatankwaadiyon kii ek aisi khep bheji gai he, jo dikhne main ladki jaise lagate hai
 These are snipers
 lambey bal
 Smokey eyes
 najuk si ungliyaan
 Scarf on the head
 charhara badan
 But what is this sirhane kyon rakhi he iske gan
 who is it? Is there any beautiful problem? Maybe yes
 
 This is the only problem
 tabhi to indian army ko isaki ek arse se talash he
 Because this is a killer
 sena ke 2 javaanon samet 5surakshakarmiyonki
 So is the responsibility of spreading terror in Kashmir really on these delicate shoulders now? kya sarhad ke us paar baithe aakaaon ko ab apane aatankiyon par yakeen nahin
 And they are sending these beauties to Mission Kashmir
 pehle pahal jab bhartiya sena ke haath ye tasviren lagi to unhen bhi shaayad aisa hi laga
 Because these and around 3 more like them have been crossed so that they can target
 suraksha balon ko or wo bhi apni pahchaan chupa kar chehre par nakaab lagaakar taaki pahchaan baaki rahe
 But know that when the mask came off these faces, i could not believe it
 jab jaise jaise in chehron se nakaab utraa
 Everyone's mood changed too
 ji
 
 haa jab sach saamne aayaa to har koi hairaan rah gaya
 Because if the mask did not come out of this face, then you too were thinking the same way as we were thinking
 yahi aatank ke aakaaon kii bhi koshish thi
 Because these are snipers
 aasaan jubaan main ye chup kar apane torget ko nishaanaa banaate hai
 Four such people have plagued the security forces in Kashmir
 ab chunki ye chehre par nakaab lagaae hote hai to ye pataa karnaa bhi mushkil hota he ki nakaab ke peeche mard he yaa koi aurat
 In the same way, by becoming Bahrupia, they are targeting army soldiers in Kashmir
 ab tak 5 surakshakarmiyon ko aise sniparon ne nishaanaa banaaya he
 The terrorist organization Jaish has got its snipers across the border for the attack
 do-do snipers ke do gut banaae gaye hai
 Those who have been sent by training of intelligence attack
 unhen ye training paak kii khufia agency iesai ne khud di he
 According to sources, an intelligence report has been sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs regarding the spippers
 uske mutabik jaish ke ye sniper do samoohon main sitambar ke maheene main bharat main daakhil hue hai
 Which are lashed with sophisticated weapons
 or inamen se khubasurat si ladki kii tarah dikhne vaale jis sniper kii ye tasviir aap dekh rahe hai uskaa naam abu kaari he
 Abu Qari's face is now exposed
 or ab tak jo sniper chhip-chhip kar sena par hamale kar rahaa tha
 Now he himself has come under target of the army
 pichley kai dinon se abu kaari naam kaa ye sniper apane aatanki giroh ke saath suraksha balon ke javaanon ko target kar rahaa tha
 Abu Kari and similar snipers are being told to be behind the killing of 5 security personnel
 18 sitambar 2018sniper hamale kaa pehla sandigdh maamla saamne aayaa
 a CRPF jawan was injured in Neva, Pulwama

 The third suspected case of sniper attack came out on 27 October 2018
 srinagar ke bahari ilaake naugam main aise hi ek sandigdh snipers hamale main siaisef ke sab inspector rajendra prasad shahid ho gaye
 The security forces in Kashmir have lost their ears after these suspected sniper attacks
 suraksha balon ke chaukas javaanon kii nazar ab un 4 sandigdh snipers ko talash rahi he
 It is being told that Abu Qari is roaming in South Kashmir
 kashmir main aatankiyon ke sniper hamalon ko lekar sena abhi or saboot juta rahi he
 However, intelligence agencies have warned against such attacks
 kashmir ghati main sakriy sandigdh sniper hamalaavaron ke paas aise em-four carbine hone kii ashanka jataayi ja rahi he
 Like the carbines used by NATO troops in Afghanistan
 aise hathiyaaron se 500 se 600 meter dur se hamalaa kiya ja saktaa he
 Also, the attackers are feared to have night vision devices as suspected sniper attacks took place at night
 sandigdh sniper hamalon ke dauraan jahaan aatankiyon kii sajeesh or taiyaari dekhi ja rahi he, vahiin bhartiya surakshakarmiyon se hui chook bhi saamne ai he
 Because at the time of the attacks Indian security personnel were out at their posts and were using mobile phones
 kashmir ghati main sandigdh sniper hamalaavaron kii maujuudagi ne surakshabalon ke liye to chunauti pesh kii he, rajya main viipi suraksha ko lekar bhi chintaa bad gai he
 The IG of Kashmir Police has written to all security agencies warning them about such snipers and a guideline has also been issued to the security personnel

 This time the Lok Sabha elections in Bulandshahr of western Uttar Pradesh are going to be very special
 kuch maheene pehle gohatya ke shaq main hui hinsa ke baad yah kshetra puure desh main charchaa kaa vishay ban gaya tha
 Now that Lok Sabha election campaign is in full swing in the country, Bulandshahr is also not behind it and people are eyeing this parliamentary constituency as it is called the stronghold of the Bharatiya Janata Party in which the SP-BSP or the Congress is trying to make a dent

 bjp's Bhola Singh is currently the MP from the Bulandshahar parliamentary seat, the Congress's big bang since 1952
 pichley chunaav main unhone yahaan se prachand jeet hasil kii thi
 The parliamentary history of Bulandshahr dates back to 1952 and Congress won continuously in five elections held here from 1952 to 1971, but after that voters here voted for different parties in successive elections
 1977 main bhartiya lok dal, 1980 main janata dal ne yahaan congress ko karaari maat di thi
 But in 1984 the Congress managed to make a comeback
 haalanki 1989 ke baad se congress yahaan par vaapasi ke liye sangharsh kar rahi he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won five consecutive elections from 1991 to 2004 in the 90s after the Janata Dal's victory in the 1989 election
 is dauraan 1991 se 1999 tak bijepi ke chhatarpal singh ne is seat par apana dabadabaa banaae rakhaa
 In 2004 too, BJP won from here
 2009 main yahaan samaajawaadee party ke ummidavaar kamalesh valmiki ne badi jeet darj kii, lekin 2014 main desh main chali modi lahar kaa asar yahaan bhi dikhaa or bijepi ne jeet hasil kii
 According to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Hindus, 77 percent of the population in Bulandshahr has more than 17 lakh voters
 inamen 9 lakh se adhik purush or kareeb 8 lakh mahila voter hai
 Bulandshahr has around 77% Hindu and 22% Muslim population
 bulandshahr loksabhaa ke antargat kul 5 vidhansabha anupshahar, bulandshahr, dibai, shikarpur or syana vidhansabha siten aati hai
 BJP has won all these 5 seats in the 2017 assembly elections
 bulandshahr kii hi syana vidhansabha seat vahi jagah he jahaan par 2018 ke aakhir main gohatya ke shaq main hinsa hui thi
 a policeman and a young man were killed in the violence
 bulandshahr hinsa ne raajnneetik taur par kaaphi surkhiyaan batori thim
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, there was a Modi wave in Uttar Pradesh, due to which the magic of BJP came
 bulandshahr main bhi bijepi ke bholaa singh ko prachand jeet hasil kii thi
 In the 2014 elections, Bhola Singh received 60 percent of the votes, out of a total of 10 lakh votes, he got about 6 lakh votes
 bahujan samaaj party ke pratyaashee pradeep kumaar jatav ko 1 lakh 82 hajaar vot mili the

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special newsletter maa chamunda devi kajodhpur main vishalkay mandirhai
 In this area, Mother Chamunda Devi was worshiped as the total goddess of the Parohar Parivars, about 550 years ago
 jodhpur kii sthapana ke saath hi mehraangadh kii pahari par jodhpur ke kile par is mandir ko sthapit kiya gaya
 Mother Chamunda is the presiding goddess of the royal family of Jodhpur
 maa chamunda ke is mandir kii sthapana 1459 main raav jodha ji ne kii thi
 Earlier, the mother Chamunda was considered to be the people of Jodhpur and surrounding areas and worshiped her
 lekin maa chamunda main logon kaa vishwaas 1965 ke yuddh ke baad badhata chalaa gaya
 The reason behind the growing faith of the people is said that when the 1965 war took place, Jodhpur was first targeted and mother Chamunda appeared as a eagle and saved the lives of the Jodhpur people and somehow Jodhpur was not allowed to suffer any loss
 tab se jodhpur vaasiyon main maa chamunda ke prati atoot vishwaas he
 The priest of the temple, Ghanshyam Purohit, said that the glory of Mother Chamunda has been so high that today there is hardly any village or city outside Jodhpur where people do not know and know Mother Chamunda
 isi vajah se desh or videsh kii jaani maani hastiyaan jodhpur main aakar apane mangalik kaary puure karte he

 The UPA government's plan to allot land to political parties to make its headquarters in the capital has gone awry
 jin partiyon ko mahangi jagahon par jameen di gai he, unhone un sarkari bangalon par bhi kabja jamaa rakhaa he, jahaan se ve is samay apni gatividhiyaan chalaa rahi hai
 Small parties have refused to take the land allotted to them
 unka kahana he ki jameen ke aavanton main unke saath sautela vyavhaar kiya gaya he
 In March 2007, UPA-1 decided to allot land on the basis of the total number of mps of the party in two houses
 200 se zyada saansadon vaali partiyon ko 4 acre jameen aavantit kii gai thi, to 101-200 saansadon vaali partiyon ko do acre, 51-100 saansadon vaali partiyon ko 1 acre or 26-50 saansadon vaali partiyon ko aadha acre
 The Congress benefited the most from this policy and got four acres of land
 bhaajapa ko do acre or makapa ko ek acre jameen mili
 In this policy it was clearly mentioned that the parties would have to vacate the government bungalows which they are occupying within two years of the allotment of land
 congress ne, jise july, 2007 main nai dilli main kotla road par ek bhukhand mila tha, apane karyaalay kaa nirmaan abhi tak shuru nahin kiya he
 The BJP, which has got a plot on Deendayal Upadhyay Marg, is also not planning any time to build its office there
 dasambar, 2008 main kotla road par jameen paane vaali makapa ne apana nayaa daftar banane ke liye paisa jutaney kaa abhiyaan shuru kar diya he
 The decision to allot land to political parties was taken when the Supreme Court pulled up the government over the case of not vacating government bungalows in the Lutyens' area in the capital
 congress kaa mukhyalay 24 or 26 akbar road par sthit vishalkay bangalon se chalata he
 The rent of these two bungalows of Party Type-7 is only Rs
 45,832 per month
 detii he
 Burma's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suki used to live at 24 Akbar Road at the age of 14
 us samay unki maa daav khinaki bharat main rajdoot thim
 Later this bungalow was in 1977 by the Rajya Sabha MP of Congress from Andhra Pradesh
 venkatswami ko aavantit kar diya gaya tha
 Since then, the Congress has occupied it and made it the office of the All India Congress Committee

 party ne is bangale ke liye april, 2009 se june, 2011 tak kaa kiraaya abhi nahin chukaaya he
 Small parties are accusing the government of creating a devious policy
 unka aarope he ki isse unke saath anyaay hua he or congress ko acchhee jagahon par jameen mil gai he
 Samajwadi Party MP Mohan Singh says, "congress has occupied all the good places in Central Delhi
 upie ne apni sahyogi partiyon ko bhi phayda pahunchaaya he
 He has allotted us land in the industrial area of vasant Kunj
 madhya dilli se itani dur aakar koi bhi party apana daftar nahin chalaa sakati
 We cannot accept the way the government is treating us
 ''rakanpa or basapa ne bhi kramshah saket or vasant kunj main aavantit jameen lene se inkaar kar diya he
 They are asking for land in central Delhi
 saket main embi road par 1,008 varg meter kaa bhukhand paa chuki shivasena dinadayal upaadhyaay maarg par jameen maang rahi he
 UPA ally DMK is upset

 We have complained to the Urban Development Ministry last month
