 When Narayanasamy got the new idea of the multi-member Auditor General and Comptroller (CAG) on 11 November, it was clearly testifying to the growing frustration of the UPA government over Vinod Rai
 isse sarkaar kaa yah dar bhi saamne aayaa ki agle kuch maheenon main shaayad kuch or dhamaakedaar report dekhne ko milen
 These prospective reports relate to social projects, policies and programs of the government, which were kept out of the purview of the CAG until Rai came to the post in 2008
 raay ne pad sambhalate hi santhaan ke charter main likhe uske nyaayadhikaar kshetra kaa hawala dete hue charter ko dobaaraa pusht kiya or inhen apane daayre main le aae
 Rai may also take the government back this time as he is confident of retiring in May next year when he turns 65
 chunki sieji sanvaidhanik sanstha he, lihaaja uske niyam-kaayade se koi bhi chhedchhad karne ke liye sansad kii manjuuri jaruri hogi or aisa koi bhi sanshodhan sadan ke do-tihaai bahumat se hi paarit ho saktaa he jab donon sadanon ke kul sadasyon ke kam-se-kam aadhe maujuud hon or matdaan karen
 This will be very difficult for the UPA
 jawaharlal nehru shahari navinikaran yojana (jeenenyuarem) kii sieji report raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ke paas pehle hi bheji ja chuki he or ise sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main sadan main rakhaa jayega
 Apart from this, the reports prepared include the review of the MNREGA, 2008 Kisan Debt Waiver Scheme and fertilizer subsidy report
 sieji ke ek aalaa adhikari ne bataaya, ‘‘ye sab sarkaar ko mushkil main daal dengi
 The report of JNNURM will be kept at the beginning of the session, while the remaining three will be kept in the last days and if it is too late then they will be presented till the next year's budget session
 ’’sutron ke mutabik, ek lakh karod ru
 In the audit of the JNNURM project, the Center has found errors in the allocation of grants
 sieji ne paaya he ki centre ne kuch aise rajyon ko fund jari kiya jinaki shahari ikaiyaan jaruri disha-nirdeshon ko puraa nahin karti thim
 It was found that in many cases no work has been done while the Center is spending its budgetary allocation
 kuch maamalon main sieji ne tender sambandhi disha-nirdeshon ke ulanghan ke chalate nuksaan kii baat bhi kahi he
 This grant was given for projects related to improving urban infrastructure in the states
 saat saal kaa yah mishan 2005-06 main shuru hua or disambar, 2012 main 11veen panchavarshiya yojana ke saath hi khatm ho rahaa he
 In its detailed review, the CAG has put the government in the dock
 upie kii ek lakh karod ru
 Another scheme of MNREGA is also faltering
 sieji ne anudaanon ko jari kiye jane main baari bhrashtachar or vibhinn staron par gambhir aniyamitaayen or paise ke durupyog kii baat pai he jinamein gram panchayatein bhi shaamil hai
 It is ironic that the then Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh approved the cag's investigation into the scheme in October 2011 as the government had earlier banned it citing the cag's charter
 sieji ne manaregaa ke kriyanvayan main aniyamitataayen, farji shramikon ke naam par paise hadapney, bhugtan main deree, bina paise die kaam karwaane or record ke aniyamit rakrakhaav sambandhi gadbaditaan pai hai
 It has also been found that the authorities responsible for implementing it in many states have taken over the scheme and there has been a huge outpouring of taxpayer money
 is report se sarkaar kii pareshaani bad sakati he
 CAG has raised Rs 65,000 crore
 kii kisaan karj maafee yojana main bhi gambhir gadabadi pai he, jise kathith taur par chaar karod kisaanon ke laabh vaali yojana mana ja rahaa tha
 In the draft of an inspection report, the CAG indicated that its beneficiaries were selected without any rules and were selected from a few places, and those who really wanted relief were released
 bharat krishak samaaj ke adhyaksh ajay vir jakhad ne is yojana ko kareeb se dekha he
 He told India Today that the plan was a complete mess
 die gaye karj kii jaanch main paaya gaya ki aadhe se zyada labhaarthi kaarobaari or duusare log the, jinke paas kheti kii apni jameen he
 According to him, during 2009-10, most of the beneficiaries were from Delhi and Chandigarh and not from Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab or Bihar
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki sarkarein sahakaari bainkon ko protsaahan dene kii bajaae karj dene ke liye saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ko prerit kar rahi thi
 This is the first audit when the CAG has also examined the books of banks associated with the case
 sutron ke mutabik, masauda report main labhaarthiyon kii pahchaan se judi gadbaditon kii baat kahi gai he
 The draft report says that "unqualified farmers" have made huge gains in their pockets at the expense of eligible farmers of the "small and marginal" category
 sieji ne paaya ki jin kisaanon ne samay par lone chukaa diya unhen koi laabh nahin mila jabaki jinke karj lambey samay se dub rahe the unhen karj maafee kaa laabh mil gaya
 The CAG report on fertilizer subsidy may also embarrass the UPA government
 masauda report kahati he ki 2007-08 or 2009-10 ke bich urvarak vibhaag ne sabsidi ke taur par 50,000 karod ru
 In this, the truth investigation process of fake claims made by the firms was not adopted
 jakhad kehete hai ki yah niti hi galat he
 According to him, "the government should focus on checking the soil of the farmers and then tell them what crop to grow and which fertilizer to use
" isaki bajaae urvarkon kaa manmarjee se bina kisi hisaab ke istemaal hota he
 "the way the CAG report on the allocation of 2G spectrum and coal blocks in the last few Parliament sessions has created a lot of uproar, the winter session and the budget session are likely to be uproar on the same lines
 jameen adhigrahan kanoon main sanshodhan ke liye laae gaye adhyadesh se pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee bahut naaraaz hai
 Mamta Banerjee termed this ordinance as a 'black ordinance' and said that the ordinance that the central government has brought will take people's land at gunpoint and as long as they are alive then someone's land will be mentioned in this ordinance
 Can not be taken in ways
 mamata ne kaha ki nae adhyadesh ke tareekon se jameen kaa adhigrahan unki laash ke upar se hi kiya ja sakegaa
 At the same time, Mamata Banerjee also said that since the arrival of the Modi government in the country, the situation has become worse since the Emergency era and the Modi government is working against democracy
 bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne ek baar phir argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Modi has tweeted that the government is going to celebrate the birthday of convicted Lalu Prasad Yadav on June 11
 unhone tanj kasate hue likhaa he
 
 
 'so what tomorrow?' shahabuddin, prabhunath singh or rajballabh yadav jaison netaaon kaa bhi janmdin sarkaar samarohpurvak manaayegi or tohfa bhent karegi
 Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and Road Construction Minister Tejashwi Yadav has announced that he will dedicate the bridge being built between Ara and Chhapra on the Ganges to commemorate his father RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav's birthday on 11 June
 yaheen nahin us din kai or mahatvapurn pulon kaa usee din uddhatan karne kii yojana he jisamen patna ke digha or sonpur ko jodne vaali sadak pul bhi shaamil he
 On June 11, there is a lot of work going on about the traffic on it
 susheel modine bihar pul nirmaan nigam se sawaal kiya he ki kya usne vishwaas kaa pul bananaa chod diya he, jo lalu prasad yadav jaise ghotaale main sajayaftaa vyakti ko mahima mandit karne ja rahi he, jo vyakti nigam ke parshad kaa chunaav bhi nahin lard saktaa
 Lalu's Alakatra scam: Modi did not stop here, he said that Alakatra scam took place during Lalu Prasad Yadav's rule
 200 karod ke is ghotaale main path nirmaan mantri ko istipha dena padaa or jail kii hawa khaani padi, jis lalu rabari or congress ke raaj main bihar main sadaken gadde main tabdeel ho gai thi
 Inaugurating the bridge on his birthday is a joke to the public
 modi ne kaha ki alkatraa ghotaale ke daur main bihar kii sadakon kii marammat or nirmaan kaa pratishat 92 se ghatakar 6 fisadi ho gai thi
 But the Alakatra purchase was increased from 14 per cent to 93 per cent, Alkataras were bought and sold in the market in the name of the divisions that did not need Alkatara
 unhone kaha ki 900 karod ke chaara ghotaale main sajayaftaa lalu prasad ke kaarykaal main hi 200 karod kaa alkatraa kharid ghotaalaa hua tha
 Ilyas Hussain, a close aide of Lalu Prasad Yadav, who is acquitted in the lower court, should challenge the CBI in the High Court

 According to a statement issued by the Commission late evening, a committee has been formed in this matter
 ayog ne vaigyanikon kii is uplabdhi kaa raajnneetik istemaal kar chunavi laabh lene ke liye pradhanmantri dwaara desh ko sambodhit karne kii vibhinn dalon kii shikaayat milane ke baad isaki jaanch ke liye samiti kaa gathan kiya he
 The Commission said, "the matter of addressing the country through electronic media by the Prime Minister has been brought to the notice of the Commission
 ayog ne chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone ke bich adhikariyon kii samiti gathit kar tatkaal is taamle kii jaanch karne kaa nirdesh diya
 "it is noteworthy that CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury wrote a letter to the Election Commission saying that during the elections, the Prime Minister addressed the country to take political advantage of the achievement of scientists and it is a violation of the code of conduct
" yechuri ne ayog se yah bhi poocha ki kya pradhanmantri ne ayog se anumati lekar desh ko sambodhit kiya
 Earlier, after the Prime Minister's address, sources in the Commission had said that matters related to national security and disaster management do not come under the purview of the Election Code of Conduct
 yah puche jane par ki upgrah bhedi missile kshamta ke safal prayog kii jaankaree desh ke saath saajha karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sambodhan kya aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he, adhikari ne kaha, ‘‘cabinet suraksha samiti kii baithak hui thi

 According to sources, the angry mob blocked the road by putting a tractor trolley on the bulandshahr-garh state highway and started shouting slogans against the police administration

 After this, the anger of the people erupted and they started throwing stones at the police

 ensipi ko is baar 1 seat zyada mili he, kyonki congress apane adhyaksh kripashankar singh ke liye kalina seat bachaana chaahati thi
 In return, the NCP had to give up Kurla and Bhandup seats
 yani ab ensipi 115 siton par chunaav ladegi, jabaki congress 173 siton par
 The list of ticket seekers was long, after a day's ruckus at 10, Janpath, the Congress leaders cleared the names of more than 100 candidates for the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, but could not decide that the sons and daughters of the elder leaders should be Whether to be given a ticket or not

 India and the
 africa is maidan par pehali baar khelenge
 India won here against Australia in 2009, while Sri Lanka defeated them by three wickets in 2009 itself
 yah maidan bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ke liye bada bhaagyashaalee rahaa he
 Dhoni has scored two centuries here in a span of three months
 unhone pehla shatak oktober 2009 main australia or doosraa shatak disambar 2009 main srilanka ke khilaaf lagaaya tha
 Dhoni is not confident about his good performance on this ground but he is confident that the team will try to improve their record on this ground
 dhoni ne shuukravaar ko kaha, "is maidan par hamaara record 50 fisadi kaa rahaa he
 We will try to improve it
 yahaan hameshaa bade score khadey banaae gaye hai
 i have not seen the wicket yet, so cannot say what can be expected from the wicket at the moment
 iske baad hi ham team sangyojan ke bare main sochenge
 "dhoni has dismissed the fact that his team's performance so far has not been commendable
 unhone kaha ki unki team nirantar vikaas kar rahi he or dakshin africa ke saath hone vaale mukaable se bhi kuch sikh hasil karte hue quarterfinal kaa apana safar shuru karegi
 Dhoni said, "you cannot deny us
 ham acha kar rahe hai
 There is scope for improvement but at the moment our goal is victory
 jab tak jeet mil rahi he, ham nishcint hokar apni ranneeti par tike rahanaa chaahate hai
 Our morale is high and we will try to beat South Africa in the next match

 India won their first match against Bangladesh

 gendbaaji bharat kii sabase kamjor kadi ke rup main ubhari he
 This was also seen on the Ferozeshah Kotla ground on Wednesday when the Netherlands opening pair added 56 runs against them without losing any wickets in the first 15 overs
 netherlands ke khilaaf sachin tendulkar or virendra sahvaag ne jis tarah kii shuruyaat kii thi, usase yahi lag rahaa tha ki bharat yah match 25 overon main jeet legaa
 This would have been very good for the team as it would not only increase their points but also improve their net run rate
 ireland ke khilaaf bhi bharat ke saath aisa hi hua tha
 Ireland had scored 207 against India in the first play, and at one time only returned their pavilion to three of their veterans with a total of 87 runs
 england ke khilaaf jo hua, usase sabhi parichit hai
 The batsmen achieved the target of 338 runs on their own but the bowlers could not keep it safe
 vah to england ke ballebaajon kii naakaami thi, jiske kaaran bharat ko pehali haar kaa tohfa nahin mila
 The assessment of four matches says that fielding along with bowling is a weak link for Team India
 saath hi saath kamjor tiimon ke khilaaf bhi bade ballebaajon kaa laaparvaahee se khelnaa team india ko badi tiimon ke khilaaf kaaphi mahangaa pad saktaa he
 On the other hand, South African team Breeshak lost their third match to England but this has not affected their morale

 congress ke varisht netaa shashi tharur ne ravivaar ko is baat par jor diya ki congress party kii jimmedaari he ki vah dharmanirpekshata kii raksha kare
 He also said that the solution to the party's crisis in the Hindi belt is not in 'majority appeasement' or on the lines of 'coke light', in offering some kind of 'light Hindutva' and walking on this path will lead to 'congress zero'
 
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki bhaajapa or uske sahyogiyon dwaara hindu hone kaa daawa ‘british footbal ke badmaash samarthakon’ kii apni team ke prati vafadari se alag nahin he
 In an interview to PTI before the launch of his book 'the Hindu Way: An Introduction to Hinduism', Tharoor claimed that the propaganda being done by the ruling people is not true Hinduism, but rather a noble view They are 'distorting', which they have turned into a narrow political weapon for purely political and electoral gains
 tharur ne kaha ki ek satark ashaavadi ke rup main vah kahana chahenge ki badi sankhya main aise bhartiya hai, jo haal ke ‘roodhiwaadee rujhaan’ kaa virodh karne ke liye patibaddh hai or ve lagaataar yah sunishchit karenge ki ‘bharat ko lekar vikrut vichaar’ safal na ho
 Tharoor said, 'as a member of the Congress party, i believe that the party has a fundamental role in protecting secularism in India
 isaki aguwai karnaa uskaa kartavya he
 'he said,' Those who are suggesting that the solution to the party's crisis in the Hindi belt is in 'majority appeasement' like the BJP are making a big mistake
 yadi matadaata ke paas asli cheez or uski nakal ke bich kisi ek ko chunane kaa vikalp ho to vah har baar asli ko chunegaa
 Tharoor said that instead of being intimidated by the success of the BJP, it would be better for the Congress to stand for the principles it has always believed in and inspire the country to follow them
 congress netaa ne kaha, ‘nishthavan log ek aisi party kaa sammaan karenge jo hamaare vishwaason ke saahas ko pradarshit kare, na ki ‘coke lite’ or ‘pepsy jiro’ kii tarj par kisi tarah ke ‘lite hindutv’ kii peshkash kare, ‘lite hindutv’ kaa ant sirf ‘jiro congress’ ke rup main hoga
 In the recent Lok Sabha elections, the Congress party was wiped out of the entire Hindi belt
 iske baad party ke andar or baahar kuch logon ne yah suzav diya ki congress ko ‘alpsankhyak tushtikaran’ ko lekar bhaajapa kii kahani kaa jawaab dene or apni dharmanirpeksh pahchaan par naram rukh apnaane kii jarurat he
 'coke Lite' and 'pepsi Zero' are sugar-free and calorie-free versions of the original soft drink brand
 tharur ne kaha, ‘hindutv kii khubsuurati yah he ki hamaare yahaan kanoon banane ke liye koi pope nahin he, koi imam fatwa jari kar yah nahin bataata he ki sachcha mat kya he, koi akelaa pavitra granth nahin he
 There is no such thing in Hinduism
 ’ On one side, there is a debate in India about singing the national anthem
 vahiin padosi desh china ab raashtragan or rashtriya dhvaj ke apmaan karne par teen saal kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan laa saktaa he
 Till now, only 15 days were punished under this
 sthaneey media ke anusaar, china kii sansad ne desh ke raashtragan 'march of da walantirs' kaa anadar karne par 15 din karawas kii sajaa dene sambandhi ek kanoon paarit kiya tha
 An amendment to consider this has been introduced in the two-month session of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee
 shinhua samvaad samiti ne bataaya ki masaude ke anusaar is maamle main ulanghankartaaon ko teen saal karawas tak kii sajaa ho sakati he
 These places will be allowed to play the national anthem, including the opening and closing of NPC sessions, formal political gatherings, constitutional oath-taking ceremonies, flag hoisting ceremonies, large events, prize distribution ceremonies, commemorations, National Memorial Day celebrations, important diplomatic occasions, big sporting ceremonies and others
 Will be on appropriate occasions
 is sanshodhan main kaha gaya he ki antim sanskaar, anuchit nijee avasaron, vigyapanon main yaa saarvajanik sthanon par parshv sangeet ke rup main raashtragan kaa prayog anuchit hoga
 These violators include those who maliciously change the national anthem or disrespect the national anthem or sing it incorrectly
 aapako bataa den ki china kaa raashtragan kavi tiyaan haan ne likhaa he or iske sangeetkaar nie er hai

 a historic victory that changed everything, Australia's gurur, the birth of a spirited Team India, Ganguly's roar, Harbhajan's hunk, the wall of India and Laxman's troubleshooter
 
 
 naa jane or kya-kya badla tha us din
 Yes, the Australia team that visited India, crushed India badly in the first Test played in Pune, everyone is shocked
 test shuru hone se pehle bhartiya captain viraat kohli samet puraa desh kah rahaa tha ki yah australian team kaaphi kamjor he, ham ise aasaani se haraa denge
 But Team India fell into its own trap and got caught in the spin of Steve o'keeffe, eventually losing the Test match by 334 runs
 2001 kaa daura yaad rakhana2001 main bharat daure par 3 test kii siries khilne aiaustralian timus samay apane charam par thi
 She had won 15 consecutive Tests and won the 16th Test after trailing India by 10 wickets in Mumbai
 lekin kolkata ke eden gordon main khele gaye duusare test match main bharat kii team ne jabardast khel dikhaaya or follow-on ke baavjood team india ne kangarooon ko dhul chataa di
 India won the Test by 171 runs

 Despite the hat-trick, the Australians put up a big score of 445 and in reply India rolled to 171
 australia ne bharat ko follow-on khilne ko kaha
 In reply, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman played historic innings for India, Rahul scored 180 and Laxman scored 281 runs
 in donon ke bich kul 376 ranon kii saajhedaari hui
 Bhajji's double attack India gave the Kangaroos a target of 385 runs to win the Test
 jiske jawaab main australia kii puri team maatr 212 ranon par dher hui, pehali pari main8 wicket lene vaale harbhajanane duusari pari main 6 wicket liye
 India won the match by 171 runs, later India also won the third Test and captured the series 2–1

 i felt it only when she brought her first budget as finance minister
 brikeces kii daastaa se bharat ko azaadi dilaane vaali vitt mantri bajet ke maamle main jaldi hi vicitra sabit huin
 The dock media introduced her as Lakshmi while the work was of Kubera
 tabhi laga tha ki kuber chhaviyon ke sansar main apane visthaapan ko sahan nahin karenge
 The bizarre minister withdrew several major decisions within two months
 ab elaan kar diya he ki march tak bharat petroleum bik jayega
 In the condition of the public by the dock media and whatsapp University, it is possible that the employees of Bharat Petroleum can see the glory of nationalism and Hindu pride in it
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki bharat petroleum ke karmchaaree bechney ke samarthan main raily karenge kyonki virodh main karenge to koi tivi channel to dikhayega nahin
 News paper will be printed in two or three lines
 jab unhone media ke bik jane kaa samarthan kiya to apni petroleum company ke bikne kaa bhi samarthan karenge
 i believe so
 reserve bank se lakh karod liya ab ise bech kar lakh karod lenge
 Why the discomfort of selling a profitable company? Is the petroleum ministry and the minister's office going to end? Dharmendra Pradhan said that the government's job is not to sell oil, then why should any minister in the government sell private oil to see it? That too? The Cabinet is leading to collapse; The lie is extreme
 jab report aati he ki chalis saal main upabhokta karch sabase kam he to sarkaar report hi jari nahin karti he
 The first one-third was compared to the same quarter of the previous or at least one to two years ago
 ab khabaron main aane laga he ki aath saal main sabase kam, das saal main sabase kam
 Now the decade has come instead of quarter
 aise main bharat petroleum ke bikne kaa kya hi shok manaaya jaae
 It is just to see which company names on the board of Bharat Petroleum
 bharat petroleum ke saare petrol pump shahar ke mukhya zamin par he
 Which company will have a monopoly on it? The game will be on it
 baaqi bharat kii arthvyavastha vicitra mode main chali gai he
 Hence the Finance Minister has also become a bizarre minister
 unhone kaha ki jo log sawaal kar rahe hai, vah rashtrahit main kar rahe hai, janhit main kar rahe hai, deshhit main kar rahe hai
 Taking the money of the country, taxpayers, joking with the soldiers and martyrs of the country and suddenly giving contracts to those who do not even have experience of making airplanes of the defense, that too by increasing the price
 aap sirf in sawaalon kaa jawaab de den
 You just answer that 126 aircraft were talked about
 hamane 36 par samjhauta kyon kiya? kin sharton par samjhauta kiya? daam itane kyon badha die gaye? ek jhooth yaa ek sach ko chupaane ke liye ham 10 jhooth bole ja rahe hai

 shriram kaa janm bhi caitra navaratri main hi hua tha

 navaratri ke shubh dinon main bhuulakar bhi na karen ye kaam- kaha jaataa he ki navaratri main devi or navagrahon kii puja se puure saal grahon kii sthiti anukool rahati he or jivan khushhaal rahata he
 - Pandits also say that during the days of Chaitra Navratri, the mother herself lives on the earth, hence worshiping her gets the desired fruit

 loksabhaa main mangalvaar ko paas hone ke baad saamaanya varg ke kamjor varg ko aarakshan dene vaale bill par rajyasabha main charchaa hui
 Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien attacked the Modi government fiercely during the discussion in the House
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne sansad kaa apmaan kiya he
 Derek o'brien said that one morning a person in Delhi had a dream that if the constitution changes, he brought this bill
 aaj aap agar loksabhaa ke opanian pole dekhen to NDA 150-160 par ruk rahe hai, lekin ye bill yuva-garib-aam aadmi ko dhokhaa he
 During this, he attacked the government sharply and said that we are not members of any Gymkhana Club, Ahmedabad, which you are insulting
 pichhali sarkaron ne kareeb 65 fisadi bill cametiyon ko bheje lekin is sarkaar (gymkhana club) ne sirf 20 fisadi bill hi bheje
 Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad protested when Derek called the government Gymkhana Club
 jis par turant tiemasi saansad ne kaha ki vah check karke aae hai is shabd se sadan main koi aapatti nahin honi chahie
 The TMC MP said that according to government figures, till now earning up to 32 rupees was poor, but according to this bill, earning up to 2100 rupees would be considered poor
 aaj kaa yuva puch rahaa he ki naukari kahaan hai to ye sarkaar pakoranomics sikhaa rahi he
 He claimed that Mamata Banerjee's government in West Bengal had promised to double the income of farmers in 2011, but this government came in 2016 and said this
 unhone kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ab tak rajya ke kisaanon kii aay teen guni tak kar chuki he
 Let me tell you that the bill to provide 10 percent reservation to the economically weaker people in the general category has passed in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday
 aaj is bill par rajyasabha main charchaa ho rahi he
 Most of the opposition parties, including Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party in Rajya Sabha have supported this bill, although during discussion all parties questioned the timing of this bill
 narendra modi sarkaar kuch hi dinon main apni pehali saalagirah manaayegi
 Opponents would underestimate the government's tenure as expected
 lekin khud bijepi ke varisht netaa or sahyogi dal bhi aalochana karne lage, to sarkaar ke liye mushkil khadi ho sakati he
 Indeed, the constituent of the National Democratic Front is unhappy with the attitude of the Akali Dal Narendra Modi government
 party ke netaa naresh gujral ne sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'centre sarkaar apane sahyogiyon ko saath lekar nahin chal rahi he
 'he said,' Modi government should learn from Vajpayee government
 'naresh gujral ne modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke tareeke par sawaal uthaaya he
 He said that the Modi government has not called a meeting of its partner parties even once on the land acquisition bill
 vaajapeyi sarkaar kaa hawala dete hue akali netaa ne kaha ki 'agar gathbandhan purv endie kaal kii tarah hota to aaj koi dikkat nahin hoti
 'significantly, earlier, senior BJP leader and former Union Minister Arun Shourie has failed the Narendra Modi government on the economic front
 unhone kaha, 'modi kii aarthik niti dishaheen he
 They should focus more on policies rather than projects
 'shouri ne kaha ki sarkaar main tex vyavastha ko lekar kanfusion he
 Investors are losing out on government decisions
 unhone daawa kiya ki sarkaar alpsankhyakon ke bich dar dur karne main naakaam rahi he
 Arun Shourie has also alleged that the trio of Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley are running the government

 The current situation in Pakistan is that every child born here is born with a loan of one and a half million rupees on his head
 isiilie ab pakistan main bhi ham do hamaare do kii maang teji se uthne lagi he
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan has warned that every child born in Pakistan is a 'ticking time bomb'
 badhati aabaadi par qaabu paane ke liye supreme court ne naseehat di he
 Also, in view of the increasing unemployment in the country, he was also instructed to curb the population
 iske baad ab pakistan main bhi ham do hamaare do kii maang jor pakad rahi he

 Statistics say that 70 million people out of 21 of the Pakistani population are below the poverty line
 yani har das main se chaar pakistani garib he
 The situation on that is that the country has a debt of about 30 thousand billion

 We are not saying this, rather it is the Chief Justice of the Pakistani Supreme Court

 jiske baad sachiv ne court ko bataaya ki jansankhya vruddhi dar ko kaabo karne ke liye ek yojana taiyaar kii gai he
 Under which population growth rate by 20251

 " Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne shanivaar ko kaha ki rajeev gandhi equity bachat yojana ko niveshkon ke liye or aakshark banane ke vaaste aane vaale bajet main isamen sudhaar kiya jaayegaa
 The Finance Minister said that the Ministry will re-review the tax incentive measures given in it and will try to address the concerns of investors
 rajeev gandhi equity bachat yojana kii shuruyaat karte huye unhone kaha, ‘niamak ko maine aashwast kiya he agle bajet or agle vitt vidheyak main ham avasar kaa laabh uthaate huye is yojana main jaruri badlaav karenge
 According to the experience that we have got while preparing the scheme, we will make necessary changes in it and make it attractive to retail investors
 ’chidambaram ne mana ki yojana ke bare main kuch chintaayen uthaai gai hai
 The scheme is complex for the general investor and is difficult to understand
 ab ise saral banaaya jaayegaa or niveshkon ko isamen bhaag lene main kathinaayee nahin hogi
 The plan was announced by the then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in the 2012-13 budget
 naye niveshkon ko puunji bazaar main nivesh ke liye protsaahit karne ke uddeshy se yojana laai gai thi
 The Finance Minister said, “some people say that it is beyond the comprehension of the common investors to understand the kind of incentives that have been talked about in the scheme
 kuch kaa kahana he ki 50,000 rupee tak ke nivesh par 50 pratishat katautee kaa laabh dena upyukt protsaahan nahin he
 Chidambaram said that the government has allowed mutual funds to participate in the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme
 ise shuru main keval naye niveshkon ke liye hi rakhaa gaya tha
 Chidambaram also stressed integration in terms of 'know Your Customer - KYC' rules
 unhone kaha, ‘ek hi niamak ke tahat kaam karne vaale kaarobaar bhagidaaron, madhyasthon ke liye alag alag kevaisi niyam nahin ho sakate hai
 Worse will be the case when we have to create different sets of KYC for different regulators
 isse niveshak pareshaan hokar dur honge
 'he said,' If investors are away from the market and investment business, then what is the need of so many regulators and so many intermediaries and partners
 hamaara uddeshy aakhir main niveshkon ko akshirt karnaa hona chaiye
 If you ask many questions to investors, then which investor will open an account and who will participate in it, in that case it will go away
 ’chidambaram ne is baat par aashcharya jataayaa ki yadi kisi ke paas bank khaataa he to vah sidhe dipogitary khaataa kyon nahin khol saktaa he
 'if you will be engaged in many types of investigation before opening an account, then i have no doubt that five out of ten potential investors will be removed
 vah kahenge ki apana samay kyon barbaad kiya jaye
 He said that there is a need to simplify these tasks
 ‘hamen niveshkon ko aashwast karnaa hoga ki vittiya utpaadon main nivesh or puunji bazaar main nivesh karnaa puri arthvyavastha or desh ke liye behatar he or niveshak ke liye yah dirghakaalik laabh dene vaala he
 The Finance Minister said that the government wants small investors to come forward and invest in the capital market
 ‘ham iske liye share bazaar ko samarthan dena chaahate hai jisase ki chote niveshkon ko bazaar main nivesh ke liye protsaahit kiya ja sake
 Under the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme, a small investor who invests in shares for the first time will get the benefit of 50 percent income tax reduction on investments up to Rs 50,000

 The Minister of State for Transport said that all kinds of digital arrangements have also been made to collect tax money
 sabhi toll par swip mashin di gai he
 Local administration has also been imposed on all toll plazas so that common people do not face any trouble
 gauratlab he ki aath november ko modi sarkaar ne madhya raatri se paanch sau or ek hajaar ke puraane note band karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 Since then, several steps have been taken to deal with the cash problem
 deshbhar ke neshnal haive ko toll free karnaa isi kaa hissaa tha
 National Highways were made toll free from 9 November to 11 November, later these discounts were extended to 14, 18 and 24 November
 phir is chhot ko 2 disambar tak badha diya gaya
 Special things 1
 shuukravaar aadhi raat se lagane lagegaa toll tex2
 Tax will be levied at all 367 toll plazas in the country
 toll tex yadi 200 rupee se zyada hua, to 500 ke puraane note bhi chalenge While the big parties in the state are repairing their spikes, the smaller parties are also paying for their place in these elections
 koi sthaneey jaateey sameekaran ke boote maidan main utar rahaa he to koi virodhiyon ko mahaj sabak sikhaane kii manshaa se kud padaa he
 This is the reason that while the number of registered small parties was 112 in the last assembly elections, till now it has reached 178
 04 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todepichley vidhansabha chunaav main 112 chote dalon ne chunaav ladaa lekin inke khate main keval 5 vidhayak hi aae
 Democratic Congress, Bharatiya Manashakti, Janam Morcha, Rashtriya Swabhiman Party and Uttar Pradesh United Democratic Front got one seat each
 pichley chunaav main ambedkar kranti dal, adarsh lokdal, ol india minurities front, bhartiya naagarik party, bam party, jansatta party, vikaas party or moderet party jaise kai dalon ko ek fisadi vot bhi nahin mila
 10 most among registered small parties
 49 fisadi vot apana dal ko mila jo congress ke 8
 84 percent to two percent were higher
 iske baavjood apana dal kaa ek bhi ummidavaar nahin jeet paaya
 28 December 2011: See India Today in the pictures, these parties are coming together to increase their strength, taking lessons from the last election
 ittehad front (ekta morcha) isi kaa nateeja he
 The Front, consisting of 13 smaller parties including Peace Party, Apna Dal, Bharatiya Samaj Party and Indian Justice Party, has announced to contest all the 403 assembly seats in the state
 isi tarah kareeb darjanabhar partiyon se bana rashtriya parivartan morcha bhi chunaav main utar rahaa he
 In this front, besides the Kshatriyas, Palas, Gadaria, Kewat, Pasi, Maurya, Kushwaha, Mali, leaders of other backward castes are included
 rajnatik vishleshak abhaya kumaar bataate hai, ''agali vidhansabha main kisi bhi dal ko purna bahumat na miltaa dekh chote dalon ne apni takat badhaane kii koshish shuru kar di he
 This is why many small teams are coming together
 '' yahi nahin, vampanthi dalon ne bhi ekajute hone kii ranneeti banaai he
 21 December 2011: See in pictures Amar Singh, who is separated from India Today Samajwadi Party (SP), aims to teach a lesson to his adversary Azam Khan
 unki party rashtriya lokmanch bhi taal thokane ko taiyaar he
 He has declared, "where Azam will contest elections, Jaya Prada will also descend from the public from there
 ''chote dal un netaaon kii ek sharansthali bhi sabit ho rahe hai jinka bade dalon se tikat cat rahaa he
 The Peace Party has opened its doors to leaders expelled from the BSP
 purv basapa vidhayak jitendra singh bablu or lakhimpur se basapa vidhayak rajesh gautam pis party main shamil hokar chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Professor of Department of Political Science at Lucknow University, Dr
 ramesh dikshit bataate hai, ''kuch log chunaav ladane ke bahaane surkhiyon main aane kii koshish karte hai
 Small parties fulfill their desires easily
 ''14 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india tudeiske alaava raajnneeti main aparaadhiyon, vyavsaayiyon or naukarshahon kii badhati aamad ne bhi chote dalon kii sankhya main ijapha kiya he
 The Election Commission finds itself unable to crack down on these parties
 rajya ke mukhya nirvachan adhikari umesh sinha bataate hai ki chunaav ayog ke paas dalon ke panjikaran kaa adhikaar to he lekin inkaa panjikaran nirast karne kaa adhikaar na hone ke kaaran chote dalon kii sankhya par lagaam nahin lag paa rahi he
 In view of the fact that no party has any major issues in the state and interesting conflict between BSP, SP, Congress and BJP in many places, small parties have started seeing their important role
 unhen lagata he ki ve ek morche ke taur par trishanku vidhansabha main sarkaar banane main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 In such a situation, a coalition of small parties, especially in eastern Uttar Pradesh, can reduce the fortunes of candidates of many big parties

 the outside will fall into place # internationalyogaday # worldyogadaya post shared by Adah Sharma (@adah_ki_adah) on Jun 21, 2017 at 12:08am PDT Jagannath was the last Congress Chief Minister of Bihar, the loose grip in the state of Egypt, the condition of the Congress was diluted in Bihar, on the legacy of Lalit Narayan Mishra, his political stature, Dr
 Jagannath Mishra, who was once a strong pillar of Congress in the politics of Bulandibihar, on Monday in New Delhi i breathed my last
 unke nidhan par bihar sarkaar ne teen din ke rajkeey shok kii ghoshnaa kii he
 He joined the ruling Janata Dal United at the last moment leaving the Congress hand

 Mishra, who gave his political standing on his brother's legacy, lost his hold, the grip of the Congress in the state's politics became thin
 rahi-sahi kasar puri kar di mandal kamishan kii report lagu kiye jane ke baad raajnneeti kii badali dhara ne
 The political existence of Jagannath Mishra became virtually ineffective in the era of caste politics and the fodder scam, allegations of mortgaging Golghar and Gandhi Maidan in a way pushed him back into the background
 bihar ke supaul jile ke balua bazaar main janmen doctor mishra pradesh ke aakhri congressi mukhyamantri the
 After the assassination of brother Lalit Narayan Mishra, Jagannath Mishra, who strongly carried forward his political legacy, was counted among the strongest Congressmen of Bihar
 vah san 1975 se 1990 ke bich teen baar sanyukt bihar (tab jharkhand bhi bihar kaa bhaag tha) ke mukhyamantri rahe
 The politics of Bihar also witnessed the period when Congress and Jagannath Mishra became complementary to each other in the state
 jagannatha mishra yug ke avsaan ke saath hi bihar kii siyasat main congress ke sitare bhi gardish main chale gaye
 The Congress never emerged after that
 jagannatha mishra ke mujffarpur sthit makaan se chand kadam kii duuri par paley-bade bihar ke varisht patrkaar anil gupta ne jagannatha mishra ke jane ke baad congress kii durdasha ke liye netritv shoonyata ko mukhya vajah bataaya
 He said that the then top leadership of the Congress did not allow any leader of the state to emerge
 gutbaji ko prashray diya gaya
 Gupta said that in the 16 years between 1975 and 1990, the Congress changed many Chief Ministers
 bhagavat jha aaazaad samet kuch or netaaon ko bhi mukhyamantri bana diya gaya, jo apane kshetra ke bhoop to the lekin samgr bihar main inaki sweekaaryata nahin thi or inamen se kisi ke bhi paas mishra jaisaa janaadhar nahin tha
 The caste politics that started in the shadow of the Mandal Commission and the rise of Lalu Yadav posed a strong leadership crisis in the state in front of the Congress

 The real thing is the heat of your life has reached how many
 jivan kaa arth he apane peeche kuch nishaan chhod janaa
 'in this novel, the writer has put into words the life struggle of a normal woman in very simple and easy language
 kolkata kii prishthbhumi par likhe gayi is upanyaas main is mahanagar kii saamaajik, saanskrithik, aarthik sthitiyon kaa bakhubi varnan kiya gaya he
 The novel has two main characters - Deepshikha and Jungle Kumar

 The novel begins with the struggle of Deepshikha

 Deepshikha, seeking her existence here, joins computer course and also gets a job as a programmer
 jahaan deepashikha ek ore khule vichaaron vaali ladki thi vahiin uski maa roodhiwaadee or dakiyanoosee soch par vishwaas rakhane vaali
 Due to the difference of ground and sky in the thinking of both, there is daily tribulation in the house

 aaj samaj pai hum ki sarvocch jivan mulya hamen hasil ho iske liye jaruri he ki in mulyon ko grahan karne vaala aadharbhoot dhaancha taiyaar ho
 'the way in which the writer recounts the untold stories and aspects of women's life struggles in this context makes the reader think that a woman, irrespective of her being in any corner of the world, has a never ending life
 Rust
 madhu kankaria ikkisvin shatabdi main bhi samaaj main faili oonch-neech kii jadon par bhi nigaah daalati hai or unpar tikhaa prahaar karti hai
 The writer makes a scathing attack on the mentality of people who are proud of being born in a high clan, 'sudama too honestly expressed his sentiment and gave a strong answer-' Ma ji, you do so much religion and don't know that much Everyone's soil is one
 khun kaa rang ek he
 We speak of a small caste to people, but you see Cham not just our work
 ab aap hi bataaie koun he choti jati kaa? aapse badla bhagwaan ne liya

 An organization conducts a three-day forest tour to make Deepshikha aware of tribal culture and life, in which Deepshikha goes
 adivaasiyon kaa jivan or sangharsh deepashikha ko badal kar rakh detaa he
 Deepshikha gives direction to her life by going among the tribals and participating in their struggle
 madhu kankaria ne adbhut dhang se adivasee asmita or sangharsh ko shabd die hai
 The mind gets distracted by reading the poor arrangement of nature by humans
 jangalon kii andhaadhudh kataai or junglee jaanwaron ko beghar hote dekh jis khatre kii ore lekhika ishaara karti he uski andekhi kar bhavishya kii ore dekhnaa sambhav nahin he
 Touching the deepest levels of the human mind, this story wonderfully creates life's pain and beauty, love and sadness
 'ham yahaan the' jivan main vyaapt karunaa, pratirodh, sangharsh, swapn, sankalp or samarpan kaa anusandhan he
 Somebody said that aimless life is corrupt and pathetic
 yah jivan satya dhire-dhire upanyaas kii nayika yaa kendriya asmita deepashikha ke bheetar aakaar letaa he, jisko vrittant kaa rup dene ke liye madhu kankaria ne diary kaa shilp apanaaya he

 bharat ke bhashaayi paridrishy main hindi ke sthaan ko lekar vyapak mithyaa dharanaen hai
 It is one of the 22 notified languages of the country
 prayek janaganana ke aankadon ke mutabik, yah desh main sabase zyada boli jane vaali bhashaa bhi he
 However, the fact is that it is not the natural language of most of the Indian states, such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Puducherry in the south; Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat in the west; Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir in the northwest; Odisha and West Bengal in the east and Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Assam in the northeast
 ye milakar desh ke 30 rajyon main se 21 ho jate hai
 It is believed that Hindi is the only or major language of states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, but if we look carefully at the linguistic structure of these states, they all have their own regional language and Hindi is one of them
 It functions as a common inter-state language
 aksar hindi samvaad kii duusari bhashaa ke taur par in rajyon main rah rahe logon yaa vahaan se guzarane vaale logon ke liye istemaal hoti he to yah bhav jor pakadaaey lagata he ki yah in rajyon kii praathmik bhashaa he
 But this is not factually correct
 1947 main desh kii aazaadee ke baad kisi ek bhashaa ko hamaari 'rashtriya bhashaa' ke taur par pariklpit karne kaa sawaal baar-baar uthta rahaa he
 Political parties have been taking this up naturally for political gains
 lekin is haisiyat ke liye agar ek taarkik dhaanche main baaki bhashaaon ke bainks hindi ke daawey kii tulana kii jaae to vah puri tarah se vaazib nahin thahartaa
 In terms of heritage value, the heritage of Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Kashmiri, Odia, Bangla, Nepali and Assamese is much longer than Hindi
 or agar teji se vruddhi ke sandarbh main dekha jaae to bhojpuri or yahaan tak ki janajaatiy bhashaa bhili tak ne hindi ko peeche chhod diya he
 Our constitution makers had a more clear view of the complexities encountered when language became entangled in the question
 unki pariklpana main bharat har myne main ek bahubhashiya desh tha, koi ekabhasheeya raashtra nahin
 The fact that it was decided to include 14 languages in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution indicates that there was no desire to bind India with any one language
 haalanki hamaare mili-jule rashtriya jivan main hindi kii badhati bhoomika ko kamatar aankane ke liye in sabhi karkon ke istemaal kii koi jarurat nahin he
 At this time, increased inter-state migration needs an effective linguistic contact
 hindi badi kushalta ke saath is jarurat ko puraa karti he kyonki hindi ke vyakaran kii khubiyaan usamen vinyas ke lihaaj se lacheelepan kii kaaphi gunjaaish chhodti hai
 It is also because of this that Hindi and other languages like Telugu and Kannada have a fairly common source of vocabulary
 phir, anya deshon ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to hindi bharat kii mukhya bhashaa ke taur par dekhi jane lagi he
 Apart from this, the working utility of Hindi is becoming more in the sociology of urban areas
 in sari kaamkaaji va dhanchaagat khoobiyon ke chalate koi hindi ko bharat kii number ek bhashaa ke taur par prastaavit karne ke liye majaboor ho saktaa he lekin zyada vyaavhaarik yahi hoga ki use 'duusari rashtriya bhashaa' ghoshit kiya jaae, or isaki kai vajahen hai
 Technically a 'second language' is one that a person uses not at home but in the market, at the workplace, and in the metropolitan social circles, but neither at home nor within close scope of their cultural exchange 
 is samay bharat main lagbhag 800 jivit bhashaaen va boliyaan hai
 Not in practice but theoretically people of 799 languages use Hindi with different level of skill
 is tarah, hindi un logon kii praathmik bhashaa he jo use apni maatrubhaasha maanate hai or un logon kii duusari bhashaa jo kisi anya bhashaa ko apni maatrubhaasha maanate hai
 In such a situation, if 799 out of 800 language communities consider Hindi as a second language, then at most it can be our second national language, nothing more than this
 isse aage kuch bhi karne kii koshish karnaa buniyadi taur par aloktantric hoga or vah bharat ke gahan bahubhashiya ateet va vartmaan ko nuksaan pahunchayegaa

 congress kii mahasachiv priyanka gandhi aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladengi, party sutron kii ore se yah jaankaree di gai he
 In January, Priyanka Gandhi was officially given the post of Congress general secretary, along with party president and her brother Rahul Gandhi appointed her in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh
 priyanka ke alaava congress saansad jyotiraditya sindhiya ko pashchimi upi kii kaman saunpi gai thi
 Congress sources say that Priyanka will not contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, as well as she will not hold election rallies
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne khud party ke liye reliyaan karne or bhaashan dene kii jimmedaari le rakhi he
 In such a situation, Priyanka can definitely join the campaign with him
 congress main priyanka kii entry ke baad rahul ne kaha tha ki unhen upi main congress sanghathan ko majboot karne kii jimmedaari di gai he
 After this, Priyanka and Rahul also did a road show in Lucknow
 congress main shaamil hone ke baad se priyanka ne saarvajanik manch par ab tak koi bhaashan nahin diya he
 Rahul Gandhi also took charge of the road show from Lucknow to the party office
 haalanki priyanka dilli se lekar upi tak tabadatod baithken jarur kar rahi hai
 In the same episode last month, he spent three days in Lucknow and participated in marathon meetings with party workers there
 party ke rukh se saaf he ki priyanka parde ke peeche rahakar hi congress ko majboot karne kaa kaam karengi
 sonia-rahul Priyanka Gandhi, already in the fray, may attend election rallies with Rahul Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh, but will not address the public meeting
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki priyanka kii maa sonia gandhi raibareli seat or unke bhai rahul gandhi amethi se loksabhaa chunaav lard rahe hai, aise main priyanka gandhi ko chunaav na ladaane kaa faisla liya gaya he
 If Congress sources are to be believed, then it is almost certain that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh not contest the election
 punjab ke amritsar se manmohan singh ko loksabhaa chunaav ladaane kii khabaren ain thim, haalanki purv pradhanmantri loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate hai

 Angered by the release of Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai attack, the Trump administration said today that the incident shows the hollowness of Pakistan's claim that Pakistani territory is not a refuge for terrorists

 He has also been declared a terrorist by our finance department

 ’unhone kaha, ‘usko reeha karne, use jansabha karne dene or logon ke samaksh upasthit hone kii ijaajat dene se pakistan ke hit kii raksha nahin hoti
 It is against the claim of Pakistan that it does not have a shelter of terrorists

 Meanwhile, Varun Gandhi is also seen falling apart in the party over allegations of Honey Trap

 At the same time, some senior party leaders are in favor of investigation

 Varun Gandhi has completely rejected all the allegations against him

 If Varun is to be believed, he has not met Abhishek Verma since 2004

 But Allen did not break the silence on the matter

 He has raised the question that despite knowing everything, why did the central government not take action? Reversing Prashant Bhushan, Varun Gandhi has threatened to file a defamation case against him

 But Varun confessed, 'I know Abhishek Verma
 unke parents congress se rajyasabha saansad the
 When i was young, i also attended Abhishek's wedding
 lekin jab se main saarvajanik jivan main aayaa hum, abhishek verma ke saath meri koi baatcheet nahin hui he'

 By the way, it has always been 'crooked pudding' for men to understand women
 mahilaon ke sharir main ek aisa ang hota he, jo khaas taur se kamkrida ke dauraan sukh kii anubhuti karaane ke liye hi hota he
 It is like a 'substitute' for a men's organ

 The oil companies and the Union Petroleum Ministry have taken this decision in the name of adjustment of local duties and taxes
 unhone sawaal kiya ki nau saal baad yah kadam kyon uthaaya gaya jabaki 2003 main yah faisla kiya gaya tha
 He said that the adjustment of local fees and taxes is only to end the subsidy
 ‘garibon ke hiton ke liye sabsidi deni hogi
 The center gets maximum revenue from states but leaves very little money for them

 The name of Vishwa Hindu Parishad president Ashok Singhal is synonymous with the Ram Mandir movement run by the Sangh Parivar
 vivaadit sthal ke malikane ko lekar chal rahe mukademe par faisle kaa unhen intjaar bhi he or agar faisla mandir ke khilaaf gaya to unki supreme court jane kii taiyaari bhi he, lekin ve baar-baar kehete hai ki aasthaa kaa masalaa hone ke chalate sarkaar ko ise kanoon banaakar hinduon ko saunp dena chahie

 While speaking at his office in Puram, 84-year-old Singhal asked the BJP to "accept the mistake" from the Ayodhya dispute to "take political advantage", even failing to praise Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 baatcheet ke anshahapane janajagran abhiyaan shuru kiya he
 a decision on ownership is coming
 kya ladaai nirnaayak mukaam par pahunch rahi he?court ke faisle ko ham antim samaadhaan nahin maanate
 The High Court will decide, then go to the Supreme Court
 iskaa antim samaadhaan sansad ke madhyam se hi hoga
 This place should be handed over to the Hindu society, when such a decision is made in Parliament by consensus, then i think it will be the final solution
 nirnay aayega to supreme court main jayega
 It is certainly that the Supreme Court will not take much time
 puure desh kii bhaavana he ki bhagwaan jo kapade ke mandir main baithe hai, vah unke liye sammanjanak sthaan nahin he
 Therefore, a grand temple should be built to give them a respectable place
 jahaan ramalala baithe hai, vahi sthaan ram janmabhumi he or vahiin par mandir bananaa chahie, yah baat hamaare santon ne kahi he
 He has also said that we had prepared a model a year ago, it was of the civil style
 sompura ji ne taiyaar kiya tha use
 On the same basis, about 40 percent of the work of stone carving is in the workshop
 santon kaa kahana he ki mandir unheen pattharon se bananaa chahie
 This is what they were created for
 mandir ke saath masjid banane ke kisi formule par baat ban sakati he?nity kii ladaai hamen nahin chahie
 There are also temples and mosques, it is a continual battle
 ayodhya sirf ram janmabhumi hi nahin, yah bada tirth he
 Lord Rama was in the Ikshvaku dynasty
 isi vansh main mahatma buddha hue
 Gurunanak happened in this dynasty
 hamane bada sant sammelan kiya tha kumbh main
 Our High Powered Committee passed the resolution that the temples should be made by the law of Parliament and be there
 unheen pattharon se banegaa or vahaan koi masjid nai nahin banaai jaaegi
 In millions of temples, crores of people are taking a pledge that a temple should be made by enacting a law in Parliament
 prajatantr kii garima rakhane ke liye yah jaruri he ki janamat ko dekhte hue sansad main kanoon banaakar mandir banwaaya jaae
 But there is no risk of re-politicization of this issue? See, this program has been decided by the saints
 yah vot kaa vishay nahin he
 It is a national subject
 kisi ko rajnatik milage isamen nahin lenaa chahie
 It is not a matter of political mileage
 ram janmabhumi par mandir bananaa vishwa shanti ke liye jaruri he
 This demand for a temple to be built at birthplace was made by the BJP in Palampur
 lekin sarkaar main aane par usase mukar gai
 He is with you in this demand right now? He should not have done this
 unako apni yah bhul sweekaar kerani hi padegi, aisa meraa maananaa he
 You have to accept the mistake because making Rama a matter of power
 
 
 vot kaa vishay bananaa
 
 
 And do nothing for the birthplace
 
 
 ve apane antahkaran se puuchhen ki kya yah thik he? agar aisi bhul unase hui he to unhen is bhul ko sweekaar kar lenaa chahie, aisa maananaa he
 Is the entire Sangh Parivar with you in this fight? It is not only the Sangh Parivar but the whole saint community
 jitne bade sadhu-sant hai, ve shuru se hamaare andolan kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 They are not in our movement, but can not say, but in the programs we have taken, all saints and all Hindu organizations are with us
 sangh parivaar to he hi
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is involved in this entire episode from the very beginning
 ham logon ne pehle 11 karod hastakshar sangrah kiye
 He is a resolution, not just a signature
 or bhaajapa bhi aapke saath he?bhaajapa bhi hindu ke naate se isamen shaamil hogi, iskaa mujhe puraa vishwaas he
 She will join as a Hindu, not as a political party
 bhaajapa main badi sankhya main aise log hai
 Everyone considers Hanuman
 main kahata hum ki bhaajapa hi nahin, chaahe basapa main hon, sapa main hon, congress main hon yaa kahin or sab ko samarthan karnaa chahie
 Demand for legislation in Parliament shows that either you do not care about the High Court's decision or there is a fear of coming against you
 hycourt kaa faisla aayega
 If you come in favor, people will enjoy
 khilaaf aae to log sadakon par sangharsh ke liye na khadey hon
 In view of the sanskars of Hindu society, they will enjoy themselves by staying in a dignity and even if adverse comes, they should run the program while remaining restrained
 aapako lagata he ki kanoon banaakar jameen dene kii maang par sarkaar vichaar karegi?dekhie, ramsetu kaa masalaa aayaa to vah bhi janashakti ke aadhaar par sulata he
 When the case went to the Supreme Court, the judges felt that it was a very serious matter and so they tried to find a way out of it and found a way out
 ramsetu todakar ab bhavishya main jal parivahan waalon ko nahin diya ja saktaa
 Amarnath's Shrine Board issue also had to return 100 acres under pressure of manpower
 hinsak sangharsh main hamaara vishwaas nahin he
 Muslim is peace loving
 jitna musalmaan he, sab shantipriy he
 But they are kidnapped by the Crusaders
 yah sankat musalamaanon ke saamne he
 Out of fear of jihadis, no liberal Muslim can even say that give three temples to Hindus
 jihadiyon kii vajah se hi bhagwaan kapade ke mandir main baithe hai
 If a liberal Muslim speaks, then he will come on the hitlist immediately
 sab ko vichaar karnaa chahie ki ab paraspar madhur sambandhon kaa samay aayaa he
 Will you go to Supreme Court if the High Court gives your adverse verdict? jarur jaaenge
 Like Ram Sethu and like the Shrine Board issue, the government is going to bow down in this matter in front of your public pressure? Do not call it public pressure, call it manpower
 harek saamaanya saansad ke antahkaran main ram hai
 a grand temple should be built, everyone would like, i believe
 mandir aam sahmati se bananaa chahie
 But it cannot be done by compromise
 samajhaite kii koi gunjaaish rah nahin gai he
 We tried very hard, we could not
 to maamla nirnaayak mukaam par he?ek hi rasta he sansad main kanoon banane kaa
 This will happen
 meraa to vishwaas he ki ek saal bhar main sab baaten nirnay hokar mandir banane lag jayega
 You have made such a request to meet the Prime Minister? i wrote a letter about Ganga, they have also decided
 mujhe to bahut anand hua he
 He has written a letter to them, the answer has also come
 mandir ke bare main bhi maine unako chitthee likhi he ki aisa nirnay hamaara hua he
 His answer is that the letter has been received
 manmohan singh ji ne agar ganga ke vishay main yah sab kiya he to meraa maananaa he ki ve ram janmabhumi ke bare main bhi jarur karenge

 lekin in sabake baavjood jat samudaay ke paas bijepi ke alaava koi or vikalp nazar nahin aa rahaa
 The Jats never voted with the Dalits, nor supported Mayawati's BSP
 sapa-congress gathbandhan ko lekar bhi jat kaaphi utsahit nahin he kyonki vahaan musalmaan voton ko zyada tavajjo di ja rahi he
 Although he feels that Ajit Singh can look into the problem of farmers, but many of them are no longer in the 77-year-old RLD chief
 yahi nahin, ajit singh kii party ne is ilaake main kai musalmaan ummidavaaron ko bhi utaara he - in sabko dekhakar kuch jaaton ko lagata he ki unke paas bijepi ko saport karne ke alaava koi chaara nahin bachataa
 However, one thing that is being heard repeatedly in this area of jats is that - it does not mean that we are all communal or we are happy with the work of BJP government at the Center
 lekin koi bhi party hamen aage rakhkar nahin soch rahi he
 ' lambey intjaar or baithkon ke kai daur chalane ke baad aakhirkaar bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne holi ke din loksabhaa chunaav ke liye apane 185 ummidavaaron kii pehali suchi jari kar di or is suchi se party ko khadaa karne or satta tak pahunchane main ahm kirdaar nibhaane vaale diggaj netaa laalkrishna adwani kaa naam kaat diya gaya or unki jagah party ke vartmaan adhyaksh amit shah ko tikat thama diya gaya
 However, bjp's considered strategy is behind the cutting of Advani's ticket
 bijepi ne gandhinagar se saansad laalkrishna adwani kaa tikat kaat diya he or unki jagah adhyaksh amit shah ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 With Shah being nominated as a candidate from Gandhinagar, it is believed that Advani's political career is now over
 adwani un chand netaaon main shumaar hai jinhone apane athak prayaason ke dam par kabhi 2 saansadon vaali bhartiya janata party ko satta tak pahunchaaya
 Advani, a six-time MP from Gandhinagar, is now 91 years old
 unke tikat kaate jane ke baad bijepi main halchal bad gai hai
 However, there were indications from the BJP that leaders beyond the age of 75 will not be given tickets this time
 gandhinagar adwani ke raajnneetik kariyar ke liye behad khaas rahaa he
 He first won elections from here in 1991
 iske baad 1998 se vah lagaataar 5 baar chunaav jite
 bjp's local leader Pradeep Singh Baghel says that the decision is for the party's parliamentary board and now the party's president Amit Shah is contesting from here
 kaaryakartaaon or logon main is faisle par kaaphi khushi he
 Shah's election from Gandhinagar has given the party tremendous energy and after this decision, the party will win 26 of the 26 Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat
 dari hui he bijepiah congressdusri ore, gandhinagar se congress ke sthaneey netaa lalji bhai desai ne shah ke yahaan se chunaav ladane ke bare main kaha ki ham is baar jeet jaaenge
 In order to give a tough fight to Amit Shah, on the question of Congress being the candidate from this seat, Lalji Bhai Desai said that we have many candidates
 party ko faisla lenaa he ki kis ummidavaar ko kahaan se chunaav ladaaya jaae
 This time the BJP is angry inside Gujarat
 unako lagata he ki 26 kii 26 seat jeetne kii ranneeti ke fail hone ke dar se bijepi dari hui he or pareshaan he
 He further said that BJP is afraid of its defeat in Gujarat because if it does not, then it would not have made some of our mlas ministers overnight
 bijepi dari hui he ki is baar uskaa pradarshan khaas nahin rahane vaala
 On Advani's ticket being cut, Desai said that the BJP has insulted its founder and chief by not giving him a ticket
 wo ek bujurg saathi hai or unhen sammaan diya janaa chahie tha
 He was entitled to a respectful farewell
 faisle ke peeche badi ranneetisthaneey patrkaar sudhir rawal ne kaha ki adwani kaa tikat katkar shah ko tikat die jane ke peeche badi ranneeti he
 It is also an attempt to control damage because the Patidar society is angry with Narendra Modi
 badi seat hone kaaran shah ke yahaan se chunaav ladane par vah aasaani se jeet jaaenge
 Even if he does not come here for campaigning, he will easily win the election
 adwani kaa tikat katkar gandhinagar se amit shah ko tikat die jane ke faisle par kendriya mantri nitin gadakari kaa kahana he ki yah faisla party kaa he or iske baad sansadeey board ne bhi is par apni sahmati jataai he to is faisle par ab zyada kuch nahin kaha janaa chahie
 Advani was our guide, guide and will guide us even further
 vah hamaari party ke varisht netaa hai or party unka sammaan karti he
 Gadkari further said that he has reached 90 years of age
 aise main party ne duusare logon ko mauka diya he or ab hamaare adhyaksh amit shah gandhinagar se chunaav ladenge
 At the end of the atal-advani era in the party, Nitin Gadkari says that there is no talk of ending the era
 party aage badhati rahati he, lekin party main senior netaaon kaa sammaan hameshaa bana rahata he
 It is believed at the local level that now that Amit Shah is going to contest from Gandhinagar, he will win the election without any special struggle, as well as his parliamentary seats in the state will have the advantage of contesting Lok Sabha elections in Gujarat

 Will Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari be the Chief Ministerial candidate from the BJP in the upcoming Delhi Assembly Elections 2020? This question and discussion has started because this thing has come from the BJP leadership itself
 kendriya shahari vikaas mantri or dilli chunaav ke liye bijepi ke sah prabharee hardip puri ne kaha he ki bijepi manoj tiwari ke netritv main hi dilli chunaav ladane ja rahi he or vahi mukhyamantri banenge
 However, a few hours later, Hardeep Puri took a U-turn and tweeted that his statement meant that BJP in Delhi would win by a huge vote under the leadership of Manoj Tiwari
 darasal ravivaar ko bijepi ne dilli main sabhi loksabhaa kshetron main party ke padaadhikariyon ke saath ek kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya jisko naam diya gaya ' shahari centre pramukh sammelan'
 Manoj Tiwari is the Lok Sabha MP from North East Delhi, so this program was organized in his Lok Sabha at Shastri Park
 kendriya mantri or dilli chunaav ke liye bijepi ke sah prabharee hardip puri ne dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ko siem ummidavaar ghoshit kiya Hardeep Puri said - 'we are going to contest this election under the leadership of our leader Manoj Tiwari and we will leave him as the Chief Minister' pic

 hardip puri ke is elaan ke baad sabha main 'jai shri ram' or 'ab kii baari manoj tiwari' jaise naare lage
 However, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari, who was present there on this announcement by Hardeep Puri, did not say anything
 lekin isse manoj tiwari ke naam kii charchaa shuru ho gai he
 Whereas till now, BJP was under the control of whether to contest the Delhi Assembly elections by declaring CM candidate or to try to win the Delhi Assembly elections on the face of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aapako bataa den hardip puri kendriya mantri hone ke saath dilli bijepi ke aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke liye sah prabharee hai
 After this Hardeep Puri took a U-turn on his statement and clarified in a tweet that 'BJP in Delhi is headed for victory
 party ne ab tak mukhyamantri pad ke liye kisi ko namit nahin kiya he
 Manoj Tiwari is the President of Delhi BJP
 party unke netritv main puure josh se kaam kar rahi he
 My statement meant that the BJP would win the upcoming elections under his leadership with a huge vote
 'dilli main bhaajapa vijay kii ore agrasar he
 The party has so far not nominated anyone for the post of Chief Minister
 shri manoj tiwari @delhi4bjp ke adhyaksh hai
 The party is working vigorously under his leadership
 mere bayaan kaa matlab tha ki bhaajapa unke netritv main baari maton se aagaamee chunaav jeetegi
 But the Aam Aadmi Party used this opportunity to surround the BJP
 aam aadmi party ke varisht netaa or rajyasabha saansad sanjay singh ne hardip puri ke safai vaale twit par sawaal karte hue poocha ' to iskaa matlab kejariwal ji ke khilaaf aapke paas koi nahin? bina duulhe kii baraat ? aapkaa mukhyamantri ummidavaar do ghante main hi maidan chhodkar bhaag gaya yaa bijepi ko unki pratibha par bharosa nahin he
 'respected @hardeepspuri ji, the people of Delhi want to know who is your face in front of @arvindkejriwal ji? You also mentioned Tiwari ji's name and ran away from the field in 2 hours, has the BJP given a walkover to Kejriwal by election? https: / / t
 co / 6fijb46wqxxilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne twitor par manoj tiwari ko badhai di or kaha 'main manoj tiwari ji ko aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi kii ore se mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane par badhai detaa hoon
 This tweet of Manish Sisodia was also retweeted by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 main manoj tiwari @manojtiwarimp ji ko aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bijepi kii ore se mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane par badhai detaa hoon
 https: / / t
 co / b4ywr0d9ehmanoja tiwari ne kaha, “ek rajya adhyaksh ke rup main meraa kartavya yah sunishchit karnaa he ki ham rajya main sarkaar banaaen
 The issue is not who the CM will be, the issue is on the restlessness of the AAP
 isse pataa chalata he ki ve raat main so nahin paaenge
 " siem kaa cheharaa hone ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha ki is tarah ke faisle sansadeey board dwaara liye jate hai
 It is necessary to mention here that in 2015, BJP had declared Kiran Bedi its Chief Ministerial candidate in Delhi but the party suffered the worst defeat of its history here
 philhal hardip puri ke elaan se yah charchaa shuru hui he or dekhnaa hoga ki kya dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko takkar dene ke liye bijepi siem ummidavaar kaa elaan karegi? Uttar Pradesh KDGP has praised her after a photo-viral with a female policeman on duty while in Jhansi

 isse 182 par darj shikaayat kis divijan ko jaani he yah khud ba khud tay ho jayega
 Generally, it has been often seen that some railway departments keep on running around the complainant from the spot on the complaint

 This simply means that people's trust is increasing in the Security Helpline 182
