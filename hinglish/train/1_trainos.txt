 maharashtra ke vidarbha main aane vaali buldhana loksabhaa seat pichley do dashakon se shivasena kaa garh rahi he
 From here, Pratap Rao Jadhav became an MP by winning the election on the Shiv Sena ticket in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 unhone yahaan par ensipi ke pratyaashee krishna raav ingale ko chunaav haraaya tha
 It is known that Pratap Rao Jadhav is coming from Buldhana Lok Sabha seat twice in a row
 is baar bhi shivasena unhen maidan main utaar sakati he
 At the same time, NCP can play bets on a new candidate after losing the election twice in a row
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra main congress or ensipi 50:50 ke formule par chunaav lard rahe hai
 The Congress and NCP will leave some seats for their allies
 inamen buldhana loksabhaa seat bhi shaamil he
 NCP can field strong candidates from here this time
 kya rahaa he seat kaa itihaas
 
 
 
 buldhana loksabhaa seat lagbhag 40 se zyada varsh tak congress kaa garh rahi he
 The first election was held here in 1951, at that time, two mps from one seat Gopalrao Bajirao Khedkar and Laxman Bhatkar had reached Parliament by winning the election here
 maaloom ho ki gopalrav bajirao khedkar maharashtra pradesh congress ke pehle adhyaksh bhi the
 Let me tell you that Buldhana Lok Sabha was such a seat where once the seat used to be one and the MP was two
 darasal, aazaadee ke baad desh main hue pehle do aam chunaavon main vidarbha ke bhandara, akola va buldhana nirvachan kshetron se ek saath do-do saansad nirvaachit hote the
 In this, one was elected from open category and one from reserved (scheduled caste) category
 isi vajah buldhana se pehle aam chunaav main hi do saansad nirvaachit hue
 In 1952, Laxman Bhatkar from the reserved category and Gopalrao Khedar of the Congress won elections from the open category
 1957 main hue duusare aam chunaav main buldhana se arakshit seat khatm kar di gai
 After this, Shivram Rango Rane won the election in the 1957 Lok Sabha elections
 iske baad wo 1962, 1967 main bhi chunaav jitkar loksabhaa pahunche
 But after the demise of Shivram Rango Rane in 1970, the Lok Sabha elections were held again
 is baar bhi yahaan congress jitkar ai or vaay es shivaram jitkar loksabhaa pahunche
 He again won elections from here in 1971
 jab 30 saal main pehali baar haari yahaan congress
 
 
 
 1977 ke loksabhaa chunaav main republic party of india (khobragade) ne congress ke jeet kaa silsilaa todaa or yahaan pehali baar daulat gunjaaji gawai chunaav jite
 However, in the very next Lok Sabha elections i
e
 Balachandra Ramchandra Wasnik managed to win the Congress here
 unke baad bete mukul vaasanic congress kii tikat se 1984 main yahaan se chunaav jite
 BJP won only once
 
 
 1989 main yah seat bijepi ne pehali baar fatah kii
 Sukhdev Nanaji Kale arrived here winning the election
 haalanki, 1991 main mukul vaasanic yahaan dobaaraa jite or congress kii vaapasi karai
 This time BJP could not do anything amazing here
 shivasena kaa udai
 
 
 In 1996, Anandrao Vithoba Adsool of Shiv Sena won the Buldhana Lok Sabha seat for the first time and opened an army account on this seat
 shivasena ne yahaan ke vidhansabha kshetron main bhi pair pasaare
 But in the 1998 election, Mukul Wasnik won the election by reversing the game
 yah shivasena kii yah pehali haar thi
 The Shiv Sena played bets on this seat by rebranding Anandrao Vithoba Adsul
 unhone 1999, 2004 main jeet darj kii
 After this, Anandrao Vithoba Addasul took the seat of Amravati and in 2009 Pratap Rao Jadhav stood here
 unhone 2009 or 2014 main lagaataar is seat se jeet hasil kii
 What is the status of assembly constituencies
 
 
 buldhana loksabhaa seat ke antargat 6 vidhansabha seat aati he
 In this, the Congress holds Buldhana and Chikhali assembly seats
 vahiin, sindhkhed raja or mehakar vidhansabha seat par shivasena or khamgaanv or jalgaanv jaamod seat par bijepi kaa kabja he
 After a long wait by the Bharatiya Janata Party, the candidates for the Lok Sabha elections were finally announced
 holi kii shaam ko bhaajapa kii kendriya chunaav samiti (CEC) ke sachiv jepi nadda ne pehali list main 184 ummidavaaron ke naam kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Later, a name for Daman & Diu was also announced
 is tarah bijepi ne ghoshit ummidavaaron kii sankhya ab 185 ho gai he
 These names do not name Lal Krishna Advani, a senior BJP leader and MP from Gandhinagar in Gujarat
 unki jagah bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah maidan main utrenge
 It is believed that this time the BJP will not give tickets to leaders above 75 years of age
 yahi vajah he ki bhaajapa ke varisht netaa calraj mishra (devaria, uttar pradesh se saansad) or bhagat singh koshyari (nainital-udham singh nagar, uttarakhand se saansad) se chunaav na ladane kii ghoshnaa kar chuke the
 Apart from Advani, Tirath Singh Rawat has been given the ticket in place of Bhuvan Chandra Khanduri from the Garhwal seat of Uttarakhand, while state BJP president Ajay Bhatt has been fielded due to Koshiyari's retreat
 khanduri bhi badhati umr kaa takaza dekar chunaav na ladane kii ghoshnaa kar chuke the
 According to this, the BJP is giving preference to younger and younger faces over senior leaders in these elections
 gujarat kii baat karen to pichhali baar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne varanasi ke alaava vadodara seat se bhi chunaav ladaa tha
 However, he later gave up the Vadodara seat
 is baar bhaajapa kii gujarat unit ne modi yaa shah ko gujarat se ladaane kii maang kii thi
 This time Amit Shah is standing in Gandhinagar, the seat of 91-year-old Lal Krishna Advani in Gujarat
 calraj mishra kii baat karen to unki umr 78 saal kii ho chuki he
 Presently, he is a Member of Parliament from Deoria seat of Uttar Pradesh and also had the Ministry of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (minister of State - Independent Charge), but later he was taken this charge
 bich main unhen rajyapal banane kii charchaaen bhi thim, lekin aisa bhi nahin ho sakaa
 After his announcement of not contesting elections, the youth leaders of BJP active here are considered to be ticket contenders
 vahiin, murali manohar joshi kii umr bhi 85 saal ho chuki he
 He won the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Kanpur
 adwani kaa tikat katane or calraj or koshyari ke maidan se hatane ke baad kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki bhaajapa kanpur se unki jagah kam umr ke netaa ko maidan main utaar sakati hai
 The list of remaining Lok Sabha candidates of BJP is yet to come
 184 ummidavaaron kii pehali list main laal krishna adwani (91 saal) kaa naam na hone or 85 saal ke bhuwan chand khanduri, 77 saal ke bhagat singh koshyari or 78 saal ke calraj mishra ke maidan se hatane ke baad 85 saal ke netaa or adwani ke saathi rahe murali manohar joshi kaa tikat bhi cat saktaa he

 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ke taur par vivaadaaspad sosayadi se sambandhit filon ko scindia or deshmukh donon se sanchalit kiya tha

 Putting the responsibility on Deshmukh, Shinde said that instead of additional floor in the Adarsh adjacent to the Best, was not approved in my time
 ise mere kaarykaal ke baad manjuuri di gai thi
 When asked whether the ownership, land value and the qualifications of the members were confirmed before issuing the letter of intent on 19 July 2004, Shinde said that i had not approved the model file
 aashay patr jari karne se pehle 51 sadasyon kii yogyata kii pushti ke liye maine colector ke paas bheja or pushti karne ke baad mere paas file bhejne ko kaha
 However, he claimed that while issuing the letter of intent, the concerned department did not bring to his notice who is the owner of the said land
 unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri ke liye yah asambhav he ki vah har file ko dekhe
 The Chief Minister has secretaries to assist him, who handle all the files
 unhone kaha ki sachiv jab jaanch kar lete hai to mukhyamantri ke dastakhat ke liye sachiv kaa likhaa ‘of da ricard’ note ke saath file aata he
 Shinde said that when the Chief Minister signs, the Secretary, Principal Secretary and Deputy Secretary issue all subsequent administrative orders

 magar iske pehle ve vokkaligga samudaay ke sabase pramukh math aadi chunachangiri ke swami nirmalanand se milane kaa vakt chaah rahe the
 It turned out that Swami is out of the country
 aakhir shah ne khud phone lagaakar nirmalanand se baat kii or 12 agast ko mulaakaat kaa samay liya
 Thus he had to postpone his tour for two weeks
 chunachangiri math ke swami se milane ke liye shah kii itani utaavali anayas nahin thi
 The 'chanakya' of the BJP, Shah is aware that power in Karnataka passes through the monasteries
 phir vokkaligga samudaay ke bade netaa purv pradhanmantri ech
 D
 devegoda maane jate hai or unki party janata dal (secular) kaa chunachangiri math par khaasaa prabhaav mana jaataa he
 So, Amit Shah and BJP are trying to get the blessings of the monastery this time, so that they can make inroads in the Vokkaligga community
 khayr, 12 agast ko amit shah kii nirmalanand se bhent 5 ghante se adhik samay tak chali
 However, Nirmalananda says, "there was no talk of politics in such a long meeting
" haa, rajya or desh kii sthiti ko lekar baatcheet jarur hui lekin na to bhaajapa adhyaksh ne koi samarthan maanga, na hi math rajnatik rup se kisi kaa samarthan yaa virodh karata he
 However, sources in the monastery say that Amit Shah persuaded Nirmalanand that other prominent BJP leaders and ministers of the central government would keep coming to Math to seek his blessings
 is lambii mulaakaat ke baad rajya main charchaa chal padi ki vokkaligga math ke swami kaa jhukaav bhaajapa kii ore he
 They may not talk about bjp's support but they will not protest
 uske baad uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath or kendriya maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri prakaash jaavdekar bhi nirmalanand se mili
 Union ministers like Anant Kumar, Sadanand Gowda have also visited Adi Chunchangiri Math after Amit Shah's visit
 math se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, swami nirmalanand se milane kaa samay maangane vaale kendriya mantriyon or bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon kii lambii fehrist he
 At the moment he is not given time, because Swamiji orders that he does not want to meet the leader of any party coming to Karnataka during the political program
 darasal, karnataka main math sirf aadhyatmik or saanskrithik gatividhiyon ke centre hi nahin hai, ye behad ahm 'saamaajik sanstha' kii bhoomika main hote hai
 From the upbringing of poor children, to education and initiation, the system is from the monastery
 inke daravaaje sabhi dharm or jati ke logon ke liye khule hote hai
 In this context, the monasteries here function like a government institution
 jo mudde kisi bhi rajnatik dal ke ghoshnaa-patr kaa hissaa ho sakate hai, ve sabhi kaam math sau saal se karte aa rahe hai
 Food for the poor, education for children, marriage of girls from poor homes, engineering and medical colleges and other educational institutions all run under the monasteries
 lihaaja, jaankaron ke mutabik, rajya kii badi aabaadi (kuch logon ke mutabik 85 fisadi tak) pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se kisi na kisi math se judi hui he
 The monastery network is spread in all the 30 districts of the state
 jaateey sameekaran ke lihaaj se mathon kaa apana prabhutv or dabadabaa he jo rajnatik dalon ko unki ore aakarshith karata he
 The state has the largest number of Lingayat communities at 18 per cent
 is samudaay kaa mukhya math siddhaganga bangaluru se lagbhag 80 kilometre dur tumkur main he
 This monastery is considered to be pro-bjp
 iske pramukh sivakumar swami 110 saal ke ho chuke hai or biimaar hai
 Siddhalinga Swami now sees all the work of the monastery
 ve kehete hai, 'rajya' main hamaare mathon kii sankhya 400 se adhik he
 The monastery neither opposes nor endorses any political party
 ham saamaajik sarokaar se jude kaam ko puri lagan ke saath karte hai or sabhi kaa sahyog hamen miltaa he
 "N Math does not support any political party, then why is Siddaganga Mutt called a supporter of BJP? Siddalinga Swamy's answer is," Perhaps bjp's Chief Ministerial candidate B
 es
 This is due to Yeddyurappa being from the Lingayat community
 lekin hamaare math main anya dalon or anya samudaay ke netaa bhi aate hai
 We are politically neutral
 ''jansankhya ke lihaaj se karnataka kii duusari prabhavi jati vokkaligga he
 It has a population of 12 percent
 is samudaay kaa pramukh math aadi chunachangiri he
 It is considered a pro-janata Dal (secular) monastery
 echdi devegoda vokkaligga samudaay ke sabase bade netaa maane jate hai
 The influence of the Math is relatively high in South Karnataka
 yah rajya kaa vahi ilaaka he jahaan 1985 ke baad se jedies ke sabase adhik vidhayak jitate hai
 There are 150 monasteries of Vokkaligga community in the state, mostly in South Karnataka
 math ke darjanon shikshan santhaan hai
 Though there are no restrictions for children of any caste or religion in the monastery, but most of the children are from Vokkaligga community
 math ke swami nirmalanand is baat se to inkaar karte hai ki, math jedies samarthak he lekin math ke log paroksh rup se yah sweekaar karte hai ki, ''vokkaligga samudaay samaaj ke har kshetra main chaahe vah raajnneeti hi kyon na ho aage bade, yah math chahta he
 "the head of the monastery, Swami Nirmalananda, says," It is not right to call the mutt a supporter of any political party
 aisa hota to bhaajapa, congress or duusare dalon ke netaa kyon aate
 Whoever wants to meet us with reverence, our doors are open for everyone
 ''teesraa pramukh math kurba samudaay se judaa hua he
 More than 80 monasteries belong to this community
 mukhya math daavangere main shrigare math he
 The current Chief Minister Siddaramaiah comes from this community
 rajya main kurba aabaadi 8 fisadi he
 Apart from this, Suttur math-mysuru, Aastha math-udupi, Murusveera math-hubli, Kamapri math-chikmagalur, etc
 are prominent
 in mathon se essi-asti samudaay ke log jude hue hai
 Leaders of every political party are trying to get the support of these monasteries
 puri bhaajapa is baar aadi chunachangiri math (vokkaligga) ko saadhane kii koshish main isliye lagi he kyonki mukhyamantri siddharamaiya ne bhaajapa samarthak maane jane vaale tumkur math main apni paith bana lee he
 The Chief Minister has started the initiative to give separate religion status to Lingayat
 isse lingayat samudaay yaa kam se kam math kaa jhukaav siddharamaiya kii taraf hota dikh rahaa he
 Siddhalinga Swamy says, "I know that the Chief Minister has talked of giving separate religion status to Lingayat
 aisa hota he to nishchit rup se alpsankhyak dharm ke logon ko jo sanvaidhanik or kanoonee laabh miltaa he vah lingayat samudaay ko bhi milegaa
 The monastery is working only for the welfare of the community, if anyone helps, thank them
 ''darasal, siddharamaiya ne is shigufe se bhaajapa ko jhatka dene kii koshish kii he
 The BJP is not in a position to say anything on this issue except that it is not possible to do so
 bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar yediurppa kehete hai, ''congress ne sirf siyaasi bayaanbaji kii he
 Not only Lingayat, the people of other communities also have support for BJP
 log congress kii sajeesh main funsane vaale nahin hai
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah says, "all the monasteries in the state are supported by the Congress
 lingayaton ko alag dharm kaa darja dene ke mudde par yediurppa chuppi saadhe kyon baithe hai?''math ke swami bhale yah daawa karen ki ve rajnatik rup se nishpaksh hai lekin hakeekat yah he ki karnataka main na to math ke bina siyasat he, na siyasat ke bina math
 From state issues to the selection of candidates, the monasteries are directly and indirectly involved
 satta milane ke baad mantrimandal tak main mathon kii paith he
 According to information received from the people of the monastery, the leaders of each party immediately inform the master of the monastery about every decision of the party
 masalan, tikat bantbare main kis samudaay ke logon ko kitni tikat mili, jin logon kii pairvi math ne kii thi unamem kitnon ko tikat diya gaya, vagairah
 It is only after this that the Math decides which party to vote for, directly or directly, the message is given to the followers
 mathon kii taraf se kisi bhi dal yaa pratyaashee ko samarthan dene ke sanket bhi mjedaar hai
 Swami keeps the fingers of his hand in a floral shape while giving a sermon or darshan to the devotees to support the BJP
 yaa phir haath main koi pushp lekar virajman hote hai yaa darshan ke baad jane se pehle shraddhaluon par phool phenkate hai
 If the Congress has to support, then the Swami raises his hand
 jedies ko vot karne ke liye kahana he to swami apana angavastram (tauliya-gamchaa) ko baayen kandhe par rakhte hai
 JDS leader Deve Gowda holds Angavastram on his left shoulder
 baharhaal, mathon kii ahmiyat se har party ke netaa aajkal aashirwad paane ko lalayit hai
 "I or my Math is away from politics" Will the Math support BJP this time? gujarat main bijepi kii jeet par samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki janata ne jo faisla diya he, use ham sweekaar karte hai
 It is right that the public has given mandate to BJP
 bijepi jo daawa kar rahi thi, us daawey se vah kaaphi peeche he
 At the same time, the Congress party has done very well
 congress kii mehnat kaa asar dikhaakhilesh yadavane kaha ki jin sawaalon ko lekar congress janata ke bich gai kisaanon ne, garibon ne, gaanv ke matadaataaon ne samarthan kiya he or jo sameekaran bana he, uskaa bhi asar dikhaai de rahaa he
 Last-time campaigning matters: One important thing is that apart from the booth management organization in elections, last-time campaigning also matters
 bijepi ke aakhri vakt ke chunaav prachaar ne congress or unke sahyogiyon ko nuksaan pahunchaaya
 The loser will win, precisely we lose in Uttar Pradesh
 gujarat ke yuva vahaan haare
 But it is not necessary that we will always lose
 ek vah vakt aayega ki haarane vaala bhi jitegaa or jeeta hua bhi haaregaa
 You will see in the coming times that we will win and he will lose
 2019 main ho saktaa he mahagathbandhan2019 main ham chahenge ki gathbandhan bane
 But on what issues the alliance is, it is most important
 kin muddon ko lekar ham janata ke bich main jaaenge to shaayad aakhri vakt par jo dhyaan hataane kii koshish hoti he, usase batch paaenge
 If there is an issue and an alliance in 2019, then a big grand alliance might be formed
 akhilesh yadavane kaha ki main samajhataa hum gathbandhan se pehle janata ke bich muddon kii jarurat he
 As far as Samajwadi Party is concerned, we will take a decision only after strengthening our organization
 congress ne di takkankhilesh yadavane kaha ki congress sabase badi rashtriya party he
 In such a situation, the role of Congress will be important
 unhone acha pradarshan kiya he or bijepi ko takkar di he
 Rahul Gandhi has worked very hard and hard work numbers cannot be given
 lekin 2019 main bijepi ko ham kadi chunauti denge

 sanni ko final se ek hafte pehle ghar se baahar kiya gaya he
 He believes that people did not vote for him because he did not do much drama
 patna ke kankarbagh ke rahane vaale 55 varshiya ramesh shankar in dinon apane bacchon ke khilne ke tareeke or unke takneekee khelon ko lekar pareshaan hai
 They believe that even though children are enjoying these games today, only traditional games can help in making them good people
 bihar main keval ramesh hi aise vyakti nahin hai jo in takneekee khelon ko lekar pareshaan hai
 Kanwaljeet Singh of Raja Bazar also says that nowadays children of cities are spending hours daily on games like PSP Vita, Play Station Move, PS-3
 unki yah sanak na keval shaareerik, balki vyaavhaarik rup se bhi unhen pangu kar rahi he
 He says that in earlier cities too, children used to be entertained by traditional games like luka-hidi, ati-pati, gilli-danda, kite-kit, rope jumping, but now children are away from these games
 kai abhibhavak bhi ab apane bacchon ko paaramparik khelon se dur kar rahe hai, kyonki unhen yah khel pichhadepan kaa ahsaas dilaate hai
 The elders say, 'those games played in our childhood not only helped keep the body healthy, but also motivated them to work in the team
 yahi nahin, maansik vikaas main bhi yah khel madad karte the
 '70-year-old Ramkali Devi, resident of Girdnibagh, says, "leave aside the boys, girls too used to play a lot in the hot sun and rain
 bachche girte the, chot lagati thi or phir khud uthakar khilne bhi lagate the
 Maybe that's why we are physically strong even at this age
 ’apane bachapan or javaani ko yaad karte hue ramakali kahati hai, ‘ham us daur main biimaar nahin padate the
 But now the children are confined to the room with their parents
 dhoop, barish bardaasht nahin kar paa rahe hai
 If you have to stay in the sun for some time, then they become ill
 ab to shahar ke bachche parmparik khelon kaa naam tak nahin jaanate
 Renowned sociologist Professor Renu Ranjan of Patna also says that this is the result of the blind race of modernity
 vah kahati hai ki aaj bachche ek-duusare kii bhaawanaaon ko samajhane main sakasham nahin hai
 In today's era, even though children are developing mentally, they are not developing properly physically
 vah kahati hai, ‘pehle khelon ke bahaane bachche pratidin ek-duusare se mila karte the, prakritik vaataavaran se unka samanvay banataa tha, lekin ab yah sab bacchon se dur ho rahaa he
 The problem of obesity has also increased
 ’ek anya samajashastri kaa maananaa he ki paramparaagat khel chhootane kii mukhya vajah aadhuniktaa kii andhi daud he
 Nowadays, parents are shying away children from traditional sports
 ve unhen ghar se dur nahin jane dena chaahate
 He feels that the children will get hurt, they will get spoiled
 is soch ke kaaran ve unhen kamare main band kar rakhte hai
 However, one of the main reasons for the missing of these games is the construction of apartments in the city
 shahar se maidan gaayab hote ja rahe hai, bachche apartments main video game tak simit rah jate hai
 In this way, they are no longer the game nor the learning that comes from them
 israel kaa airforce van 14 janvari ko jab nai dilli main utrega to israel ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu or pradhanmantri narendra modi, donon ke haavbhaav par gaur karne kii vaaki kai vajahen hongi
 This will be the first visit by an Israeli Prime Minister to India, just six months after Modi's visit to Israel, which was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister
 tel aviv main modi kaa joardaar swaagat hua tha, donon ne badi garmjoshi se ek-duusare ko gale lagaaya tha, jisamen donon ke bich nijee dosti kaa bhav najar aa rahaa tha
 This was followed by photographs of the two Prime Ministers strolling like childhood friends at Olga beach in Haifa

 This time Netanyahu's visit, which will be equally historic, is taking place amid the perceived coolness in the relationship between New Delhi and Tel Aviv
 22 disambar ko bharat ne america raashtrapati donald trump kii ore se jerusalem ko israel kii rajdhani ghoshit kiye jane ke khilaaf sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ke prastaav par 127 anya deshon ke saath vot kiya tha
 Netanyahu called this vote a 'ridiculous' and 'absurd drama' without naming India
 uske ek saptaah baad israel ke sarkari swaamitv vaale rafel advanced dephence systams limited ne 2 janvari ko kaha ki bharat ke raksha mantralay ne halke vajan vaali 1,600 tanks-rodhi spike mixilon kii aapurti kaa 50 karod dollar kaa sauda radd kar diya he, jo haal ke varshon main sabase bada sauda tha
 These missiles were to be built in India through technology transfer in collaboration with a private company Bharat Forge and the government-owned Bharat Dynamics Limited
 rafel ke pravaktaa ne is saude ke, jise lekar company ne kareeb paanch saal tak prayaas kiya tha, radd hone par 'dukh' jataayaa tha

 But the vote of the United Nations was a real shock to Israel
 zyaadaatar ko lag rahaa tha ki bharat matdaan main hissaa nahin legaa
 On 3 January, the statement of India's Ministry of External Affairs in Parliament said that "india's stand on Palestine is independent and permanent
" yah hamaare nazariye or hiton ke anuroop he or kisi anya desh ke prabhaav se sanchalit nahin he
 "on January 4, an article in Israel's leading newspaper Haaretz titled" India wants a relationship with Israel but not serious
 '' jaahir he, isamen nai bhartiya videsh niti nadaarad thi
 Talmiz Ahmed, former Ambassador of India to Saudi Arabia, calls India's vote in the United Nations General Assembly as principled
 ve kehete hai, ''antarrashtriya kanoon ke anusaar sainya takat se hathiyaae gaye kisi ilaake ko apana ghoshit nahin kiya ja saktaa he or antim sthiti kaa faisla donon pakshon kii sahmati se hona chahie
 The situation in India is also similar to Israel and Palestine because a large part of Kashmir has been under Pakistani occupation since 1948 and we will not accept the suzerainty of any country over it
 ''lagata nahin he ki bharat do-deshon kii apni us niti ke rukh se dur hatega ''jisamen israel or bhavishya kaa falstin desh aapas main shantipurvak rahen'' jaisaa ki modi ne july main israel ke daure se pehle israel heyom ke saath ek baatcheet main kaha tha
 Soon after Netanyahu's visit to India, Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to visit Ramallah, the administrative capital of Palestine, without visiting Israel
 modi kaa yah daura may 2017 main falstin ke raashtrapati mohammad abbaas kii nai dilli yatra ke jawaab main hoga, jo modi ke tel aviv daure se do maheene pehle hui thi
 Significantly, the Indian Prime Minister did not visit Jerusalem (on which both Israel and Palestine claim to be their capital) at the time of Israel's visit
 is tarah falstin ko bharat or israel ke bich rishton se alag rakhaa gaya he kyonki bharat israel or khadi sahyog parishad (jisisi) ke chah deshon—saudi arab, sanyukt arab emirate, katar, oman, bahrain or kuwait—ke saath apane rishton ko majboot karnaa chahta he or unke saath mukt vyapaar sambandh rakhana chahta he
 India established full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1992 as it feared deteriorating relations with GCC countries
 ye bharat ko urja kii aapurti karne vaale sabase bade desh the, iske alaava iske kareeb 70 pratishat pravasi yaheen rahete hai or bharat ko salanaa kareeb 35 arab dollar kii videshi mudra bhejte hai
 India's new relations with the GCC could have an impact on West Asia's turmoil and rapidly changing geopolitics
 saudi arab, israel or america ke bich gupt gathbandhan ban rahaa he taaki bumadhya sagar se arab sagar tak fail rahe iran or shiya block ke prabhaav ko roka ja sake
 India's relations with all these countries are good, especially with Iran, which it needs to reach Afghanistan and Central Asia without Pakistan's cooperation
 use bandar abbaas ke raste chota uttar-dakshin transport galiyara bhi mil jaataa he jo rus tak parivahan ke raste ko chota kar detaa he
 The visit to Netanyahu will be very busy and full of symbolism — photographs will be taken at the Taj Mahal with wife Sara, visit the Sabarmati waterfront in Gujarat and then visit the Chhabra House with 11-year-old Moshe Holtzberg in Mumbai
 moshe ke mata-pita 26 / 11 ke aatanki hamale main maare gaye the
 This would be an indication that both countries are concerned about terrorism
 bharat or israel donon hi hira or raksha saudon se aage aarthik sambandh banane kii disha main hai
 Bilateral trade between the two countries in 2016–17
 02 arab dollar tha jisamen raksha sauda (anumaanit salanaa 60 karod dollar) nahin tha
 Import and export of raw, non-industrial diamonds was over one billion dollars
 netanyahu ke 100-sadasyeey pratinidhimandal main suraksha, krishi, jal prabandhan, raksha or praudyogiki kii companiyon ke pratinidhi honge
 In June last year, his cabinet agreed to increase non-diamond exports to India by 25 percent and spend $ 40 million for R&D
 prastaavon main bollywood ko israel main shooting ke liye suvidhaayen dene or dheron bhartiya companiyon ko vyapaar ke liye badhaava dena shaamil tha
 But the easier it is to say, the harder it will be to do
 krishi, jal or samudri jal se namak alag karne kii praudyogiki, jisamen israel ek bada khilaadi bananaa chahta he, kai kaarnon se badi chunauti sabit hogi jaise ki laagat or kisaanon kii choti khetihar jaminen
 The technology of separating salt from sea water and mini irrigation for Indian farmers can be expensive but water and electricity are cheaper because they are heavily subsidized
 isiilie bharat-israeli raksha sambandh vruddhi kaa sabase phydemand kshetra he, jisamen sarkaar hi graahak he
 Israel is India's third largest defense hardware supplier, accounting for 7 of the country's arms imports between 2012 and 2016
 2 pratishat tha
 This included radars, missiles, wartime electronic equipment systems and bombs
 israel ke raksha niryaat main bharat kaa hissaa 40 pratishat se bhi zyada he jisase use salanaa kareeb ek arab dollar kii videshi mudra kii kamai hoti he
 Israeli companies secured a billion-dollar deal in 2017 for smart bombs, radios, laser designation pods and missiles while South Block was trying to cut arms imports to promote 'make in India'
 israel kai pramukh kshetron main ekadhikaar banane main safal rahaa he
 Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) dominates the market for surveillance drones in India, as the trio uses about 176 heron and Searcher-2 drones
 yah sankhya khud israel main istemaal hone vaale kul dronon kii sankhya se bhi zyada he
 IAI and Rafael dominate the market for missiles that can target aircraft from a medium range — 70 km — for the Navy and the Air Force
 pichley saal april main bharat emarem kaa istemaal karne vaala tab teesraa desh ban gaya jab raksha mantralay ne emarem mixilon ke ek regiment—16 launture or 560 misile—ke liye 2 arab dollar ke saude par dastakhat kar die the

 Former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav has linked the development of Bihar to the issue of the deadly attack on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's convoy in Buxar on Friday
 tejasvi yadav ne twitor par likhte hue sawaal uthaaya he ki kahin bihar kii janata nitish kumaar ke kagaji vikaas se naaraaz hokar to un par pathar nahin barasaa rahi he ? tejasvi ne nitish ke kafile par hue hamale kii ninda to nahin kii magar keval itnaa kaha ki har jile main nitish kaa virodh chintaa kaa vishay he
 Taking a dig at Nitish, Tejashwi Yadav said that when there is no development at the grassroots level in Bihar, then what is Nitish Kumar going through in the entire state and reviewing? Tejashwi alleged that during his review visit, the Chief Minister does not meet Mahadalit families, but is still defying mass democracy
 tejasvi ne kaha ki bihar kii janata nitish kumaar se kaaphi naaraaz hai or aakrosh main aakar unke kafile par hamale ho rahe hai or unhen kaale jhande dikhaae ja rahe hai
 Sharing a video of the attack on Nitish Kumar's convoy on Twitter, Tejashwi Yadav said that why Nitish Kumar should introspect, why is the general public opposing him in every district? The way rjd's 15-year rule compares Jensraj was asked about this, when the question was raised that when Nitish Kumar's convoy was stoned and he was surrounded but still Jungle Raj in Bihar Is not it? Tejashwi said that the people here will review the development going on in Bihar and not the Chief Minister
 tejasvi ne nitish ko aatmachintan karne kii salaah bhi di
 Tejashwi asked the Chief Minister to ask Nitish to break away from Nitish Mahagathbandhan and form government with BJP, which Nitish should tell, after all, due to his works he is facing protests, protests and slogans in every district? That if the moral force and democratic character is left in Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, then he should tell that at whose behest, he should be against him in Bihar a vision is not published does not see the news somewhere? Tejashwi said that Nitish should take a pardon tour, not a review trip

 In such a situation, finding a good partner from his family is a challenging task
 phir itibipi main hi yadi koi jeevanasathi mil jaae to isse badhiya kuch nahin ho saktaa
 At present there are about 333 working couples in the force (ie both husband and wife in ITBP) and a lot of workers want a spouse who works in this organization, because government rules allow that couple to deploy in one place

 Nor can there be any interference of external elements in this portal, which will be able to safely take advantage of the ITBP

 Showing this skill, he left no stone unturned to 'stump' everyone out
 kisi ko pataa nahin ki dhoni ne angreji kii kavita ‘invictus’ padhi thi yaa nahin yaa unhone hollywood abhinayta morgan friman kii aawaaj main yah suna ki nahin ki main apane bhagya kaa maalik hum, main apni aatma kaa captain hum
 Poetry may have a different sense, but his feeling is connected somewhere, when Dhoni made his decision public on Sunday night , he would have such feelings somewhere in his mind
 gavaskar ne bhi uthaaya tha aisa kadamsunil gavaskar ke baad kisi bhi bhartiya cricketer ne is tarah kii shishtataa or doordarshita kaa parichay nahin diya jaisaa ki jharkhand ke is cricketer ne buudhvaar ko bisisiai ke jariye simit overon kii captaini chhodane kii ghoshnaa karke diya
 When Gavaskar decided to step down from captaincy, he won the Benson and Hedges World Championship in 1985, followed by a 96-run knock in 1987 at the Chinnaswamy Stadium when he retired
 ye aise daur the jabaki log unase or khilne kii ummid kar rahe the
 We do not listen to the greed of the record, usually we hear the players saying that we do not play for the record but how many do it
 dhoni ke maamle main haalanki yah sabit hota he ki vah record ke liye nahin khelte, dhoni ne jab test cricket se sanyas liya to vah desh kii taraf se 100 test match khilne se keval das test dur the lekin unhone apni dil kii aawaaj suni or us par vishwaas kiya
 At the same time, in the odis he had captained 199 matches, he could have touched 200, but he did not because he knew that Virat Kohli is ready to take the position and this is the right time to take a decision
 gauratlab he ki bhartiya cricket team ke sabase kaamyaab captain mahendra singh dhoni ne vanade or tii-20 kii captaini chhodane kaa faisla kiya he
 However Dhoni will continue to play ODI and T20 matches
 dhoni england ke khilaaf hone vaali vanade or tii-20 maichon main chayan ke liye bhi uplabdh rahenge
 Let us tell you that Dhoni has already retired from Test cricket
 ye bhi padhein -dhoni ne chodi vanade, T-20 kii captaini, kaha- teenon formet main ek captain jarurikoi nahin bhul paaegaa captain dhoni ke kariyar ke ye 8 padaav Indian football icon Sunil Chhetri says that the arrival of Indian Super League has increased the popularity of football in the country and now it has to be increased by organizing level matches and good media coverage

 People's interest has increased
 darshak maidan par adhik taadaad main aa rahe hai or karporate samoohon, media kii bhi dilchaspee badhi he
 We have to keep it intact, this is the first step and a lot more has to be done

 He said, 'we have to ensure that proper practice facilities are provided so that the level of play is better
 khel kaa str behatar hoga to darshak badhenge
 Indian football is undergoing a change

 unhone kaha ki kuch log koob vigyaapan dete hai lekin aap dekh lijie meraa vigyaapan bahut kam milegaa
 The Bihar government advertises for the achievement of the government where it is needed
 lekin kuch log keval vigyaapan ke madhyam se chaaye rahete hai
 i believe that you are the trustee of the government treasury and not the owner
 sarkari paisa mat karch karo anaap-shanaap tareeqe se apane prachaar par, ye kahkar nitish ne kaha ki gandhi ji ne bhi logon kii seva karne ko baat kahi thi
 Nitish Kumar said - NDA united in Bihar, do not fall in the circle of 'chhapas Lover' , Is irritated by him
 nitish ne yahaan tak ki apane mantrimandal main BJP ke sahyogiyon ko bhi ye baat saafe kar di he ki paise dekar khabar dikhaae jane ke wo kilaaf hai or vahi paisa wo logon ke upar karch karnaa chahenge naa ki apane prachaar prasar par
 BJP ministers said that just as the Jharkhand government advertises on regional channels, the Bihar government should also deal with the channels

 Though he did not name Arvind Kejriwal but it is believed that the full state status has already been in the Janata Dal United (JDU) manifesto and Nitish Kumar is still firm on his demands
 unke virodhiyon kaa kahana he ki yahi vahi nitish kumaar hai jinhone satta main bane rahane ke liye jab jammu kashmir kaa purna rajya kaa darja khatm kiya gaya to sankethik virodh dikhaakar maun dhaaran kar liya

 President ( Former) Francois Hollande should also enlighten us how the price went up from 590 crores in 2012 to 1690 crores in 2015 per Rafale fighter jet? Escalation of a mere 1100 crores

 co / j9ajbc6eayverified Timothy or a panic effort to head off @fhollande from telling the full story of why and how a 590 crore Rafale aircraft was bought for 1690 crores
 As @ambkcsingh rightly said when it rains it kinda pours
 1100 crore x 36 = 39,600 crores ! Lots at stake ! RUSH The Congress alleges that the deal the Modi government has signed for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from French company Dassault is much higher than the agreement made in the previous UPA government, causing a loss of thousands of crores of rupees to the exchequer

 Do not take any offense in filing income tax return

 The Supreme Court has recently given a ruling to this effect
 yah khabar angreji akhbaar da times of india ne di he
 According to him, if you have not filed the return of income tax at the time fixed by the government or even after the notice has been issued by the Income Tax Department, you can be prosecuted
 company yaa form ke maamle main jo log rosemara kaa bijnes karte hai jaise diarector yaa partner, un par bhi mukadmaa chal saktaa he
 The Supreme Court has upheld this in one of its decisions
 supreme court ne kaha ki agar mukademe kii shuruyaat ho jaae to tex dene vaale ko yah sabit karnaa hoga ki aakhir ve koun si paristhitiyaan thim jisamen usne inakam tex ritern file nahin kiya
 This simply means that the tax payer is responsible for proving the correct reason for not filing the return
 use yah siddh karnaa hoga ki usne jaanboojhkar aisa nahin kiya
 According to the Income Tax Act, apart from paying a fine to those who do not file the return on time, there can be a rigorous imprisonment ranging from three months to seven years

 BJP leader and Union Minister Anant Kumar Hegde even went so far as to say about the incident, that the Government of Kerala has completely failed to maintain law and order in the province
 sabarimala main mahilaon ke pravesh kii ghatana hinduon kaa dindahaade rape he
 At the same time, on Sunday, the Union Textiles Minister Smriti Irani attacked the Kerala government with a strict attack on law and order
 unhone kaha ki rajya main kanoon vyavastha puri tarah se dhwast ho gai he
 Neither common citizen nor MP of the country is safe in the state
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki kerala main rajyasabha saansad ve muralidharan ke ghar par bam se hamalaa kiya gaya or rajya sarkaar tamaasha dekh rahi he
 During the press conference on Sunday, Irani also lashed out at the media and said that the national media was showing news around the world, but not the news of an attack on a Rajya Sabha house
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya janata party or wo rajyasabha saansad ke ghar par hue hamale or aisi sabhi hinsak ghatnaon kii kadi aalochana karte hai
 The issue of violence continued in the Rajya Sabha on the Sabarimala issue

 amarnath yatra shuru hone main chand roj baaki hai
 The government has taken a big decision to protect the Amarnath pilgrims in view of the increased spirits of the terrorists during the ceasefire
 hindustan ke sabase bade ladaake yani blike cat commando ab amarnath yatriyon kii suraksha kaa jimmaa sanbhaalenge
 This Mahakavach of devotees will prove to be a great period of terrorists
 amarnath yatra kii suraksha ke liye grahamantralay ne do darjan enesji ke commando kii tainaati kaa faisla kiya he
 This is the first time NSG has been given the responsibility of guarding the Amarnath Yatra
 amarnath yatra 28 june se shuru ho rahi he
 According to intelligence reports, during the Amarnath Yatra, foreign terrorists are plotting a large-scale attack on the campo of passengers and security forces
 waal penitration radar or glok pistal se las hai commandojareport ke mutabik aatanki hamale ke dauraan suraksha balon or nagarikon ko bandhak bana sakate hai
 The creak team of NSG is equipped with a wall penetration radar and a Glock pistol in addition to a distant hitting sniper
 enesji kaa gathan 16 oktober 1984 main kiya gaya taaki desh main hone vaali aatanki gatividhiyon se nipta ja sake
 Top security officials on Thursday reviewed the arrangements for the upcoming annual Amarnath Yatra in Kashmir
 sena ke ek pravaktaa ne aaj yah jaankaree di
 The spokesman said that Chinar Corps Commander Lt Gen AK Bhatt and Jammu Kashmir Director General of Police SP Vaidya along with Victor Force Commander, Inspector General of Kashmir Zone and CRPF Inspector General jointly reviewed the security and administrative arrangements for the upcoming Amarnath Yatra 
 is ucch stareey sanyukt dal ne amarnath yatra ke margon kaa bhi nirikshan kiya or mahatvapurn sthanon par suraksha prabandhon kaa jayja liya
 During the Amarnath Yatra, the terrorists who are dazed can do anything to show their presence
 aatankiyon ke aise mansoobon kii bhanak khufia agenciyon ko bakhubi he
 This is the reason that this time the Black Cat Commandos have been entrusted with the security of the Amarnath pilgrims
 gaur ho ki amarnath yatriyon kii suraksha main pehle hi sukshabalon kii 238 companiyaan or jammu kashmir police kaa bada dasta tainaat he
 The reason for the establishment of NSG here is that the government does not want to leave the slightest scope for protection of Amarnath Yatris
 yahi vajah he ki is baar surakshabalon kii sankhya badhaane ke saath saath enesji commando ko bhi yatriyon kii suraksha main tainaat kiya gaya he
 If Pakistani terrorists managed the attack by breaking the security cordon and conspired to hold the passengers hostage for bargaining with the government, then the NSG commandos are very important to make such a conspiracy
 enesji ke saath saath siarpief kii companiyaan bhi yatra maarg ke chappe chappe par najar rakhe hue hai
 CRPF companies from outside have already been given a 3-day crash course to deal with the situation in Kashmir and the soldiers are fully prepared to deal with every terrorist attack
 darasal, baltaal or pahalgam, do raaston se hone vaali amarnath yatra kii shuruyaat dakshin kashmir se hoti he or dakshin kashmir hi pichley kuch vakt se aatankiyon kaa adda bana hua he
 This is why intelligence agencies suspect that these terrorists may target Amarnath pilgrims
 lekin surakshabal har aatanki sajeesh ko naakaam karne ke liye puri tarah mustaid hai
 The 'yamraj' of the terrorists will be deployed in Kashmir, it will be finished in a blink of an eye
 Last year, there was a terrorist attack on Amarnath Yatris, in which seven devotees lost their lives
 is baar bhi aatanki sajeesh kaa bada khatra amarnath yatra par mandara rahaa he
 Intelligence agencies have come to know that a deep conspiracy is being hatched against this journey of faith, both on and off the border
 pichley saal 10 july ko aatankiyon ne amarnath yatra par nikle bhakton par hamalaa kiya tha
 Pakistani terrorists fired indiscriminately at Anantnag on a bus filled with about 50 devotees returning from the Amarnath Yatra
 hamale main 7 shraddhaluon kii maut ho gai thi, kareeb 20 yatri jakhmi ho gaye the
 According to the latest revelations about BJP president Nitin Gadkari's company, Gadkari lent to the same firm, which had invested money in his Purti group
 regency equifin naam kii company ne gadakari kii company ke chaar karod rupee ke share kharide
 The balance sheet of Regency Equifin says that Gadkari loaned him 26 lakh rupees
 ghate main chal rahi purti company ne baad main regency equifin ko 95 lakh rupee kaa lone diya
 Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has started checking the accounts of Gadkari's company Purti Power and Sugar Ltd in Mumbai and Pune
 iskar vibhaag is silsile main jaldi hi central board of direct taxej ko report saunpega
 The Income Tax Department will find out the source of funds received by Gadkari's company, as well as the 18 companies that invested in the supply
 jaldi hi in companiyon ko bhi poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa jayega
 At first glance, it seems that many of the companies investing in Purti were fake
 jarurat padane par iskar adhikari nitin gadakari ko bhi poochtacha ke liye bula sakate hai
 NDTV has also received reports that the Center's Ministry of Company Affairs has started an investigation in the matter of infusing funds in Gadkari's companies
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki shuruaati jaanch nagpur or mumbai main company register kar rahe hai
 If there are any defects in the investigation, the investigation of Gadkari's companies can be handed over to the Special Fraud Unit of the Ministry of Company Affairs
 tippaniyan At the same time, BJP has made it clear that Nitin Gadkari, who was in controversy over his company, will not resign
 is puure maamle main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) bhi gadakari ke saath khadaa dikhaai de rahaa he
 The RSS feels that the allegations against Gadkari are political and the UPA government is doing so to divert attention from corruption
 bijepi ke sabhi aalaa netaa bhi ekasur main apane adhyaksh ke bachaav main lage hue hai
 Party leaders say that BJP does not want to make a decision about Gadkari yet to make an issue in Himachal Pradesh elections, but it is so important that after the term ends in December, it is now difficult for Gadkari to become BJP president again
 regency equifin kii balance shit kahati he ki gadakari ne unhen 26 lakh rupee udhaar die
 The loss-making Purti company later gave a loan of Rs 95 lakh to Regency Equifin
 udhar, iskar vibhaag ne mumbai or pune main gadakari kii company purti power and sugar limited ke khaaton kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 The Income Tax Department will soon submit a report to the Central Board of Direct Taxes in this regard
 iskar vibhaag gadakari kii company ko mili fund ke strot kaa pataa karegaa, saath hi un 18 companiyon kii padtaal karegaa, jinhone purti main paisa lagaaya tha
 Soon these companies will also be called for questioning
 pehali najar main yah lag rahaa he ki purti main paisa lagane vaali kai companiyaan farji thim
 Income tax officers can also call Nitin Gadkari for questioning if needed
 enditivi ko yah bhi khabar mili he ki gadakari kii companiyon main paisa lagane ke maamle main centre ke company maamalon ke mantralay ne jaanch shuru kar di he
 It is reported from sources that initial investigations are being done by the Registrar of Companies in Nagpur and Mumbai
 jaanch main koi khami paae jane par gadakari kii companiyon ke maamle kii jaanch company maamalon ke mantralay kii special frod unit ko saunpi ja sakati he
 The comments vahiin bijepi ne saaf kiya he ki apni company ko lekar vivaadon main aae nitin gadakari istipha nahin denge
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is also seen standing with Gadkari in this entire matter
 aresas ko lag rahaa he ki gadakari par lage aarope raajnneetik hai or upie sarkaar bhrashtachar se dhyaan hataane ke liye aisa kar rahi he
 All top BJP leaders are also engaged in defense of their president in Eksura
 party netaaon kaa kahana he ki bijepi abhi gadakari ke bare main koi faisla kar himachal pradesh chunaavon main mudda nahin bananaa chaahati he, lekin itnaa jarur he ki disambar main kaarykaal khatm hone ke baad gadakari kaa dobaaraa bijepi adhyaksh bananaa ab mushkil lagata he
 Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has started checking the accounts of Gadkari's company Purti Power and Sugar Ltd in Mumbai and Pune

 Sachin has scored a century of centuries in his 24-year cricket career, but he has been a victim of nervous ninties many times, and this has happened to him most times at Wankhede
 in sabake baavjood mumbai unka grihnagar he, or tendulkar ne shaayad apane vidaai test ke liye mumbai ko isliye chunaa he taaki unki aswasth maa maidan main unhen aakhri baar kheltaa dekh saken
 v In the Test match starting on Thursday in Wankhede, Mumbai, Sachin wants to see not only his fans spread all over the world, but also the team of opposition West Indies captain Darren Sammy along with his counterparts, but Sachin will have to be very careful on Wankhede because Despite making good scores many times, he has not been able to convert him into a century
 sachin vankhede par 60 se 70 ke bich main do baar, 70 se 80 ke bich main ek baar or 90 ran bana lene ke baavjood kai baar shatak banane se vanchit rah gaye hai
 But Wankhede has also brought the biggest achievement of his career for Sachin, when in 2011, at the same ground, Sachin got the opportunity to lift the first World Cup of his career
 vankhede par sachin kaa pratham shrenee maichon main to record bahut shandaar rahaa he, jahaan unhone sarvaadhik naabad 233 ranon kii pari ke saath record 3534 ran banaae hai
 But 47 in a total of 10 Test matches played at Wankhede
 05 ke ausat se sachin 847 ran hi bana sake hai, jisamen unki 1996-97 main srilanka ke khilaaf kheli gai 148 ranon kii pari bhi shaamil he
 Sachin has scored 94, 3, 8, 8 in his last four innings played at Wankhede
 vankhede par jab sachin antim baar nervas ninties kaa shikaar hue the, tab bhi vipakshi team westeindies hi thi
 Wankhede was stunned even after Sammy took a catch off Ravi Rampaul
 lekin is baar vankhede us sannaate ko todakar jashn main dub janaa chahta he

 Congress leader Ahmed Patel has said that Rahul Gandhi will be his prime candidate in the 2019 general election

 But our candidate will be Rahul Gandhi
 '' congress netaa ne kaha ki ye sabhi loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon par hi nirbhar karegaa
 He said that this is not the ego of Rahul Gandhi, he is the president of the Congress party
 agar hamen bahumat nahin miltaa he to gathbandhan kii anya partiyon ke saath baatcheet kar is par faisla kiya jayega
 If Rahul Gandhi had said that he would not become Prime Minister, the morale of the party workers would have been broken
 PM modi par kiya vacchamad patel ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne china se ye takanic sikhi he ki kisi project ko bada dikhaao or aisa kaho ki vikaas ho rahaa he
 But in reality there is no development
 unhone kaha ki sabarmati front, bullate train, metro train ko vikaas ke naam par bechaa ja rahaa he, lekin agar aap gaanv main dekhenge to koi bhi vikaas nahin he
 Today government schools are also closing

 Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut said his party considers NCP president Sharad Pawar a worthy candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 raut ne kaha ki loktantr main rahul gandhi ko yah kehane kaa adhikaar he ki vah pradhanmantri bananaa chaahate hai
 No one should make fun of it
 modi isi adhikaar ke jariye pradhanmantri bane
 At that time (in 2014) many people were of the opinion that Lal Krishna Advani should become the Prime Minister
 maanjhi ne kiya tha virodhapako bataa den ki isse pehle bihar ke purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi bhi is par tippanee kar chuke hai
 He had said that how can Rahul Gandhi say this without consensus in the Grand Alliance
 maanjhi ne kaha ki parampara rahi he ki sabase bade dal kaa netaa pradhanmantri bane, lekin gaiyr bijepi gathbandhan main mayawati, mulaayam or mamata bhi pradhanmantri ummidavaar hai
 Therefore it is necessary to build consensus
 PM ne bhi ksaa he tanjarahul gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane ke bayaan par piem modi ne bhi tippanee kii
 Addressing an election rally in Karnataka on Wednesday, he said the Congress leader's statement reflects Namdar's arrogance

 congress-ncp clashes over support to Shiv Sena; congress-ncpncp chief Sharad Pawar, who is blaming the delay on each other, wants the rotational CM to change the equation on the formation of government in Maharashtra
 somvaar ko marathon meetings benatija rahane ke baad mangalvaar ko bhi baatcheet or baithkon kaa daur chal rahaa he
 However, now a new twist has come in this game and both congress-ncp are blaming each other for delay in supporting Shiv Sena
 congress kii taraf se jaankaree ai he ki ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar sarkaar gathan par deree kar rahe hai
 It is also known that Sharad Pawar had said on Monday evening on a phone call to Sonia Gandhi that he had not received any concrete formula from Uddhav Thackeray
 jabaki duusari taraf mangalvaar subah sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ne bataaya ki ensipi somvaar ko puraa din congress ke samarthan patr kaa intjaar karti rahi
 He also said that there was no delay from our side
 congress ne sharad pavaar ko bataaya deree kaa jimmedanjit pavaar ke is bayaan ke baad congress kii taraf se hairaan karne vaali jaankaree ai
 Congress believes that Sharad Pawar wants rotational CM, hence there is a delay on his part
 yani sharad pavaar mukhyamantri pad 50-50 formula chaahate hai
 In such a situation, the equations which were seen to be in the hands of Sonia Gandhi, the key to power of Maharashtra, are now visible with Sharad Pawar
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki congress ke teen varisht netaa mallikarjun khadge kasee venugopal or ahamed patel mangalvaar shaam dilli se mumbai ja rahe hai, jahaan ve sharad pavaar se mulaakaat karenge

 press conference main rahul gandhi ke saath congress ke varisht netaa randeep surajevaala bhi the
 Before his press conference, Rahul Gandhi asked the reporters in a light manner that you are not under pressure? Is the mood right? The press conference lasted for about 18 minutes and during this time Rahul Gandhi only spoke on demonetisation and Rafael
 samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke gathbandhan main shaamil na hone ke baad congress ne loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar uttar pradesh ke liye apni alag ranneeti banani shuru kar di he
 When Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the party will contest the Lok Sabha and defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party, following its ideology with full force under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 to isse do ranneetiyaan najar aati hai
 The first Congress wants to stand on its feet in Uttar Pradesh
 doosraa, vah bhaajapa ke us janaadhar main send lagaana chaah rahi he jo multah brahman vot he or jiske khisakane se sapa-basapa gathjod kii jeet sunishchit ho jaaegi
 That is, in a way, the anti-bjp parties in UP are seeking polarization of Muslim votes and caste-based scattering of Hindu votes
 aisa isliye bhi ki sapa ke saath 2017 main chunavi gathjod baikaphire kar chukaa he
 At the moment, the Congress is saying that it will contest alone in all the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 or chunaav ke nattejey chaunkaane vaale honge
 As of now, according to party insiders, Congress Amethi, Rae Bareli, Sultanpur, Barabanki, Dhauraha, Pratapgarh, Kanpur, Unnao, Kushinagar, Moradabad, Bareilly, Lucknow, Varanasi, Allahabad, Farrukhabad, Saharanpur, Jaunpur, Mathura, Faizabad and Fatehpur Sikri Will concentrate agar yah maanakar chalaa jaae ki congress upi main vipakshi gathbandhan main shaamil na kiye jane se khijkar 80 siton par chunaav ladegi to bhi uske bayaan main thodaa aatmavishvaas dikh rahaa he
 This confidence has come from his return to power in three states, in which Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have won after 15 years
 jaahir he, isse uttar pradesh ke congressi kaaryakartaaon kaa bhi utsaah badha he
 The Congress is 29 years away from power in this state
 2014 ke loksabhaa main bhi congress kii durgati hui thi or sirf rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi hi apni siten jeet paae the
 Narayan Dutt Tiwari was the last Congress Chief Minister of the state
 disambar, 1989 tak vah mukhyamantri rahe or uske baad se soobe main congress kaa paraabhav shuru ho gaya
 After the recent electoral victory in the anti-bjp coalition that was being speculated in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress had demanded equal number of seats for itself
 jaahir he, sapa or basapa ke talmail main, jisamen ralod ko bhi jagah deni thi, congress ke liye pair failaane kii gunjaaish nahin thi
 But here, the fat got stuck
 asal main, uttar pradesh main congress ne jo siyaasi spes khaali kiya tha sapa or basapa usee par kabiz hui hai
 The traditional vote bank of the Congress was of Muslims, Dalits and Brahmins, and the SP and BSP have broken a large part of it and divided it among themselves
 khaskar, congress kaa muslim vot bank uttar pradesh main bade paimaane par chhija he
 18 of the total population in Uttar Pradesh
 5 fisadi hissaa muslimon kaa he, dalit kariban 20
 5 percent and Brahmins are 9
 2 fisadi
 The Muslim voters turned to the SP, Dalits came to the BSP and the Brahmins elected the BJP
 sapa-basapa ne philhal gaiyr-congress, gaiyr-bhaajapa gathjod par jor diya he, lekin agar unhen jeet hasil hui to chunaav ke baad talmail or gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaen bani rahengi
 BSP supremo Mayawati insists on taking regional parties with her in pre-poll alliances and has done so in Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Haryana
 to kya uttar pradesh main sthiti 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bihar jaisi hi ho rahi he? jab lalu yadav kii rashtriya janata dal or ramvilas paswan kii lokjanshkti party ne congress ko mahaj teen siten di thim
 The Congress had then decided to contest all the seats in Bihar and the NDA benefited from it
 haalanki, congress upi main sabhi 80 siton par ladane kaa elaan kar chuki he
 However, the Muslim, Jat, Jatav and Yadav votes in the state would have come together due to the joining of RLD by Congress, SP, BSP and Ajit Singh
 bhaajapa pehle hi upi main ashankaon se ghiri he or us gathbandhan se 2019 ke liye muqabla or adhik kadaa ho jaataa
 The arithmetic of this alliance would have been 50 per cent of the votes and the BJP 42
 3 fisadi vot hi hai
 It seems that with the current alliance, the votes of Hindus in Uttar Pradesh will be divided on the basis of caste and Muslim votes will become more polarized than before
 congress ne sabhi siton par ladane kaa faisla to kiya he lekin use dhyaan rakhana chahie tha ki uttar pradesh kii chunavi jameen madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan kii tarah do dhruviya nahin he
 There will be multi-party multi-cornered contests here, and the results are coming in the same way
 itnaa hi nahin, congress kii badi chunauti shaayad pradesh main 80 aise naam chunane kii bhi hogi, jo loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress ke tikat par chunaav ladanaa chaahate honge
 In most areas of the state, there is no Congress party office or even their committee
 jamini str par congress apane kaaryakarta kho chuki he
 The SP-BSP did not bring the Congress along as Mulayam Singh Yadav has openly stated that the SP had to lose its support base in a big way by taking the Congress along in the 2017 assembly elections
 ek pech shaayad yah bhi he ki teen rajyon main jeet se utsahit congress ab pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par rahul gandhi ko hi aage karegi or akhilesh yadav yaa mayawati aisa kyon chaahegi?agar congress ko rashtriya raajnneeti main taqatvar vaapasi kerani he to akele chunaav ladanaa dirghakaalik ranneeti ke tahat phydemand hi hoga
 In 2009, BJP also had only 10 seats in Uttar Pradesh
 aise main amit shah ke aakraamak or baarik chunaav abhiyaan se congress ko sabak lenaa chahie
 In 2014 and 2017, his strategy not only improved the performance of the BJP, but the results were also severe
 upar-upar jarur aisa lag rahaa he ki sapa-basapa congress ko saath nahin laae or congress isse thodi biferi hui he
 But sources in the political corridors are telling that the opposition has not deliberately taken the Congress along and the Congress will field its voter candidate in many places
 sapa-basapa gathjod ke liye yah phydemand hoga
 However, whether the decision to contest elections on all the seats alone is a compulsion or thoughtful decision of the Congress, it is certain that elections are not just arithmetic
 10 loksabhaa siton vaali bhaajapa agar 71 tak or 15 saal baad prachand bahumat se satta main laut sakati he to congress ke liye bhi dirghakaalik nitiyon ke nattejey thik ho sakate hai
 *** soshal media, aaj ke vakt main mashhoor hone kaa sabase aasaan or popular jariya ban gaya he
 Actually, although we have seen such viral videos many times, but the biggest example of this is Ranu Mondal
 pashchim bengal ke ranaghat stesan par lata mangeshkar (lata Mangeshkar) ke 'ek pyaar kaa nagma he
 
 
 Her video of the song became quite viral and she became a star after that
 ranu mandal ke video ne lakhon logon kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa tha, jiske baad ab ek 2 saal kii bacchee kaa video soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 In this video, this baby girl Lata Mangeshkar's very famous song "lag Ja throat"
 
 
 '' gaate hue najar aa rahi he
 The girl's name is being described as Pragya Medha and she is seen singing this song in a very sweet voice and in very good notes
 aapako bataa den, yah gaanaa 1964 main relies hui film ''wo koun thi'' kaa he

 Ahmed said that India is pretending to ignore the serious peace initiative proposed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan from this apex forum
 unhone sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ko suchit kiya ki pakistan ne kal sanyukt raashtra mahasachiv baan kii moon ko dastavej saunpe hai, jise kathith bhartiya sanliptata kaa ‘saboot’ kaha gaya he
 Ahmed said that 'the documents detail Indian intervention and support for terrorism in Balochistan and Karachi and particularly India's security and intelligence agencies from tehreek-e-taliban in' FATA '(federally Administered Tribal Areas)
 ’ sanyukt raashtra main sharif dwaara kashmir kaa mudda uthaae jane ke ek din baad sushamaa ne isi manch kaa istemaal karte hue bhartiya rajya jammu-kashmir ke hisson par pakistan ke avaidh kabje kaa mudda uthaane ke liye kiya or kaha ki is kabje ko vaid tehraane ke liye vahaan se aatankwaadi hamale kiye jate hai
 The comments sushamaa ne 193 sadasyeey vaishvik sanstha ke samaksh apane sambodhan main kaha, ‘hamen chaar sutri binduon kii jarurat nahin he, hamen sirf ek kii jarurat he, aatankwaad chhod de or vaarta ke liye hamaare saath baithen
 ' bharat or pakistan ke bich sambandhon main khaskar agast main rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar (enese) str kii vaarta radd hone ke baad tehraav aa gaya he
 The talks were called off due to differences on the agenda proposed by Islamabad and Pakistan's national security adviser Sartaj Aziz's plan to meet Kashmiri separatists
 ahamed ne kaha ki ‘dastavejon main bhartiya hastkshep or baluchistan tathaa karachi main aatankwaad ko samarthan dene tathaa khaskar ‘phata’ (sangh prashasit kabyli kshetra) main taharik-e-taliban se bharat kii suraksha or khufia agenciyon ke sapanrk kaa byora he
 'A day after Sharif raised the issue of Kashmir at the United Nations, Sushma used the same platform to raise the issue of illegal occupation of Pakistan over parts of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and said that to legitimize this occupation Terrorist attacks are carried out from there
 tippaniyan In her address to the 193-member global body, Sushma said, "we don't need four-point points, we only need one, give up terrorism and sit with us for talks
" ’ Relations between India and Pakistan have come to a standstill, especially after the cancellation of the National Security Advisor (NSA) level talks in August

 kya aap kisi mahila ko sari pahane yaa phir short top pahane dekhakar munh sicode leti hai, kyonki uski qamar or pet par stretch mark hai
 
 
 Or you are pregnant and worrying about Stretch Marcus, then say by-by-bye and adopt some effective solution

 Stretch markus is often referred to as the mark on the abdomen and thighs of women during pregnancy, but every scar that is caused by the stretch and tightness in the skin due to obesity is called the stretch mark
 stretch mark kisi ko bhi ho sakate hai inke liye kisi prakaar kii aayu yaa sex kii seemaa nahin hoti hoti
 Stretch marks usually occur on the armpits, abdomen, breasts, thighs, hips, and buttocks, because obesity causes the skin to lose the most fat or say fat increases on the same part of the body
 in stretch marcus se bachane ke liye kai tarah ke upachaar maujuud hai jaise ki surgery aadi lekin sabase behatar he inke hone se pehle hi saavdhaanee barti jaae
 It is often seen that pregnant women ignore skin changes and discomfort during pregnancy, while doing so is an open invitation to Stretch Marcus
 agar stretch marcus se bachanaa he, to twachaa main hone vaale badlaavon ke prati sajag rahen
 Itching is common in the skin, but do not itch there
 kisi achche powder yaa moischarizer kaa istemaal karte rahen yah khujali ko kam karne main aapaki madad karegaa
 There are many types of stretch mark crims available in the market, which can prevent the use of marks
 garbhavastha main bhi mahilaayein utana hi pani piti hai, jitna ki aam dinon main
 She does not drink enough water during pregnancy
 yah aadat unke liye sahi sabit nahin hoti, kyonki twachaa main prayaapt nami kii kami hone par khinchaav adhik bad jaataa he
 It is very important for a pregnant woman to consume more water for sufficient hydration and moisture in the skin
 pani zyada pine ke saath hi saath ek or behatar tarika he jisase sterch marcus par control kiya ja saktaa he
 That is your diet
 garbhvatee mahilaon kaa jarurat kii seemaa ko paar nahin karnaa chahie
 11 according to doctors
 5 se lekar 16 kilo tak hi vajan badhnaa chahie agar vanaj adhik batch rahaa ho, to jarurat he acchhee or belens diet kii
 So say junk food from your food, bye-bye and adopt nutritional food
 jis khaane main vitamin e, si or di hon, aapke or aapaki twachaa ke liye behatar sabit hoga
 Along with this, high protein food will protect the skin from stretch marks
 apni twachaa ko khinchaav ke kaaran hone vaale nishanon se bachaane ke liye niyamit vyaayaam karen
 Doing this will help the skin to spread without any problem, as well as your weight will also be under control

 Moisturize skin with aloe vera, coconut oil, grape seeds, vitamin E, pro-vitamin B-5 and aroma oils

 kishoravastha umr kaa wo padaav hota he jab insaan khud ko ek nai urja se bharaa hua mahasoos karata he
 But it cannot be denied that this is also the age when children start hiding things from their parents
 mata-pita ko bhi ye andaja to hota he ki unke bachche unase kuch chipa rahe hai lekin unhen ye samaj nahin aata he ki wo bacchon se iske bare main baat kaise karen
 Smart parents know exactly how to deal with their children
 par kai mata-pita andhere main hi rah jate hai
 In such a situation, if it is known that the children can lie, then it will be easy for the parents to manage their child
 yahaan kuch aisi hi baton kaa zikr hajinhen lekar bachche aksar apane mata-pita se jhooth bolte hai
 1
 kishoravastha main bachche aksar kisi se pyaar karne lag jate hai
 Actually, this love is less and attraction is more, but they only trust their friends about their affair
 wo is baat ko kabhi bhi apane maa-baap se nahin bataate hai
 2
 kishoravastha main pahunchane ke sathbhache apana ek alag spes talashne lagate hai
 They become their own club and group
 jiske saath wo party karte hai lekin ye party sikret hoti he
 They never tell their parents about this outing
 3
 The courage to do class bunk also comes at this age
 class banks karke doston ke saath ghoomana yaa phir kisi dost ke saath shopping par jane vaali baat bhi bachche maa-baap se chhipaakar hi rakhte hai
 4
 ek ore jahaan maa-baap bacchon kii khoj-khabar milti rahe ye sochakar unhen mobile dete hai vahiin bachche iskaa zyada istemaal doston se chat karne or fasebuk par deepi change karne main karte hai
 This thing also remains hidden from parents
 5
 Parents always want their children to have good company
 iske liye wo class ke topper bacchon ke saath hi apane bachche ko dekhnaa pasand karte hai lekin har bachche ke kuch sikret dost hote hai
 About whom their parents do not know anything

 According to him, the head of a department is a minister and in that sense the responsibility of the minister concerned is as much as that of a top officer
 isiilie mantri ko chhodkar sirf afasaron ko jimmedaar tehraana sahi nahin he
 However, SK Sharma also said that the Legislative Assembly can summon any officer at any time, seek answers from them and also ask for relevant documents
 afasaron ko javabdeh tehra sakati he, lekin barabari kii javabdehi vibhaag kaa kaarybhaar sambhaal rahe mantri kii bhi hoti he
 On the question of appearing before the petition committee, Sharma says that it is up to the discretion of the committee to whom she summons
 lekin agar yachika samiti mantri ko saman karti to use bhi samiti ke saamne pesh hona hota or aisa hona chahie tha agar puure vibhaag kii naakaami kaa maamla he to
 According to Sharma, according to the Delhi Transaction of Business Rule, the people of the legislature cannot interfere in the everyday work of the MLA or the minister or the Chief Minister
 kanoon main har kisi kaa kaam tay he or use usee ke mutabik kaam karnaa hoga

 In the terrorist attack on Mumbai on 26 November 2008, the families of the jawans who stoutly fought the terrorists without caring for their lives, are living a life of oblivion today
 mumbai police ke head consteble bhanu narkar kii patni sunanda narkar ko seene main ek goli lagi thi
 Five years after the attack, now Sunanda is stunned whenever she remembers those moments
 sunanda ke do bachche hai, jo abhi pard rahe hai
 According to him, the day the attack took place, her husband was on duty near Cama Hospital and said that he would come early in the evening, but in the morning she got the news of her husband's death
 sunanda ne bataaya ki pati ke na hone se unhen kai pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Sunanda is very angry with the government
 unke mutabik sarkaar ne madad kii baat kahi thi, lekin usko puraa nahin kiya
 The government had promised to give jobs and full wages in place of husband, but only 5000 pension is being received so far and no one comes from the government
 sunanda ne kaha, 'sarkaar ne jo 25 lakh rupee diye the wo bhi fiks kar diya, jo ki 10 saalon ke baad milegaa
 The house that the government has given, its charge is very high
 5000 hajaar ke pension se puraa maheenaa nahin chal paata
 The government had said that a petrol pump would be given, but that too is not known
 'bhanu narkar ke saath kama hospital par duty kar rahe consteble baban ughade ke parivaar kaa to or bhi bura haal he

 Younger son Vikas said, "when the attack was detected at 12 o'clock in the night, we were scared and my father got a call not to come out of the house and i was scared when the Cama Hospital was attacked
 papa kii maut kii khabar hamako subah mili
 Whenever this day comes, we miss our father a lot
 papa ke jane ke baad ham log bahut hi musiibat ke daur se guzar rahe hai
 Baban's family is also very angry with the government's attitude
 unke mutabik parivaar kaa kharch chalaanaa bahut hi mushkil he
 The government does not pay any attention
 sarkaar ne naukari dene kii bhi baat kahi thi, lekin abhi tak naukari nahin mili he
 a similar situation is with the family of Shinde, a security guard on duty near the GT Hospital
 scindia ko is hamale main 2 goliyaan lagi thim
 Shinde is survived by his wife and two children, who are still studying
 scindia kii patni aaj bhi us haadase ke jatke se baahar nahin nikal pai hai
 Shinde's daughter Neha Shinde said, "papa was on night duty when there was an attack
" us samay ham log train main the or train ruk gai
 Later it was discovered that Papa was shot and in the morning we got the news of his death
 'patni sunanda scindia ne kaha, 'pati kii maut ke baad parivaar chalaanaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 The government initially helped after he left, but no one comes to ask
 sarkaar ne ghar to diya, lekin yah nahin bataaya tha ki iskaa kiraaya bhi dena he
 Suddenly after three years, when the bill came, two and a half lakh rupees had to be paid
 pension ke paise in bill ko bharkar hi nikal jaataa he
 Like these families, there are many other families who lost their loved ones in the attack and today they are living a life of anonymity and trouble

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ko prachand bahumat mil chukaa he
 Now he wants to realize his dream of New India in which there is no discrimination in the name of caste or religion
 isiilie unhone kaha bhi tha ki alpsankhyakon ko bharamaane vaale chal main chhed karnaa he, lekin unke hi mantri or saansad nafarti bayaan dekar unke is sapane ko saakaar hone main adnga daal rahe hai
 One of the new missions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is that Hindustan should come out of the jungle of hatred and remove discrimination in the name of religion

 For example, BJP MP Bhola Singh says that if there is any inconvenience due to any religious festival, action should be taken on it
 lekin bholaa singh kii baton ko bholepan main mat lijie
 His talk did not end that it was taken away by BJP MLA t Raja Singh in Telangana

 He has removed the cap of the police and sits inside the police station wearing a forged cap

 In order to ensure that the wall of religion does not stand in the way of New India, his minister Giriraj Singh also threw a stone at the efforts of the Prime Minister
