 It is clear that Priyanka will form a new team in Uttar Pradesh after Priyanka Gandhi has decided to take a position in the Congress party and be fully active in the elections

 wo priyanka gandhi se itani prabhavit hai ki unhone congress kaa daaman thama or iske baad naa sirf chunaav jeetin balki unki priyanka se kareebi bhi badi

 In the night, the woman's mother lodged an FIR against the accused
 "yaa to jaao pakistan, yaa phir jaao kabristaan
 "since that wretched day of September 8, there has hardly been a time when this slogan of the rioters has not resonated in the ears of 21-year-old Mohammed Abid
 26 disambar ko ve arse baad is samvaadadaata ke saath kuch der ke liye apane gaanv phugana lautne kii himmat juta sake
 With the slogan of new hope, new hope at the village entrance, BJP leader Narendra Modi's banner is wishing for his new year
 aage bade to sadak ke donon ore jaaton kii buland imaaraten najar aane lageen
 Some of the women and men, who brought cane from the fields on buffalo buggy, went on mocking Abid by seeing them from the canals
 uske baad musalamaanon ke ghar shuru ho gaye
 These houses were less visible and more like ruins
 aabid kaa dil baith gaya
 The last time he saw a buzzing house before the riots started, today there is neither door nor roof
 vahaan malba he, jali hui khidkiyaan hai or dhahaai gai diwaar kii eenton kaa dher he
 In the upper room, his sky-colored Godrej fridge is broken and he has "A" on his TV set
 duusare kamare main sharaab kii aadhi bhari bottle rakhi he, jise shaayad kisi ne raat main piya tha or agali raat phir itminan se pine ke liye yahaan chhod gaya he
 He is confident that the Muslims will no longer return to the village
 (buree tarah tabah kii gai phugana gaanv kii badi masjid)nayaa baseraa banane kii dhunanshe main chur us shaks kaa bharosa bahut galat bhi nahin he
 More than 3,000 Muslims of Fugana are now living in a relief camp in Muslim-dominated Loi village, barely a kilometer away
 prashasan kii shuruaati maan-manouvval or baad kii dhauns-pattee ke baavjood ye yahaan se tus se mas hone ko raji nahin hai
 The government has given Rs five lakh to many of these families
 muaavja diya ki ve yahaan se chale jaaen, lekin sharnaarthiyon ne muaavje kaa kya kiya? apane dedh saal ke pote ko god main bithaae 55 saal ke jubair ahamed ne tapaak se kaha, ‘‘jin-jin logon ko paisa mila he, unhone aapas main milakar ab tak camp ke saamne hi 20 bigha jameen kharid lee he
 If you get more compensation, you will buy more land
 ’’ sharnaarthi ab is jameen par apni nai rihaaish banane kii taiyaari main hai
 So far 76 children have been born in this camp and 17 people have died due to illness or lack of medicines
 rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne pradesh ke mukhya sachiv or mujffarnagar or shamali ke dm se shiviron main 40 se zyada bacchon kii maut kii khabaron par jawaab dene ke liye kaha he
 Due to so many deaths, a cemetery has also been built nearby
 yaheen jindagi bhi pal rahi he
 Women bring sugarcane leaves to bean from the nearby fields in the early hours, this is why the stove burns
 skool to ab mayssar nahin rahaa lekin anganbari kaaryakarta khurshida bacchon ko do dooni chaar jarur padhaa detii hai
 With the help of lukewarm sun, the day somehow withstands the cold wave of the Himalayan valley, but the dew drips into the tent
 ameena apana dard bayaan karti hai, ‘‘paanch bacchon or shuhar ke saath is chote-se tambu main jindagi gujaarna bahut mushkil he, lekin gaanv main dekhe maut ke manjar se to yah behatar hi he
 The plot was deeply rooted in the Loi Camp, the same as the Jola village camp
 in campon main phugana, itawa, naala, kharad, allam, hasanpur, baavdi, hadalli, rinpuda, daha, bhadal, kutamalli, lisaad- hasanpur, kutwa, kutvi or kakda gaanvon se visthapit rah rahe hai
 The story of all of them resembles each other
 mujffarnagar se budhaanaa hokar shamali tak jane vaale raste par aise kai camp aapako najar aa jaaenge
 This terror struck home, the 30-year-old Mohammed Nazim of Etawah turned something like this, "on September 8, three days before we were destroyed, there was a lot of stone pelting at our house
" or subah vahi log aakar poochne lage ki bhai kya hua? 7 sitambar tak gaanv ke bharosemand log hamase kehete rahe ki kuch nahin hoga, aap bharosa rakho
 And on the 8th, his own children, with whom we had to get up in childhood, attacked us
 ’’ najim ke chachaa kaa sir fat gaya
 Somehow he escaped after killing himself
 baaki gaanvon ke log bhi us roj kii kahani kuch isi tarah bayaan karte hai
 On asking that there have been riots in the country before, but people have been returning to their homes after the boiling cold, so why are you killing children in the cold? Somewhere it is five lakh rupees
 muaavje kaa laalach to nahin? is sawaal par 65 saal ke medu bhadak gaye
 Then they burst, "who hit us in broad daylight
 katlo gaarat machaai
 They are wandering open till date
 jab kanoon naam kii koi cheez nahin he to ham vahaan marane ke liye kyon jaaen
 It is better to be killed, let us die from the cold here
 ’’ aankade bhi medu kii baat kii tasdik karte hai
 More than 6,000 people have been named in riots in five districts of western Uttar Pradesh, 566 firs in Muzaffarnagar district alone but only 76 people arrested
 rahul, mulaayam or modiitna bada fasaad hua to netaa log bhi yahaan pahunche
 Sonia Gandhi came, Manmohan Singh came, Mulayam Singh came and Akhilesh also came
 baad main rahul gandhi bhi pahunche
 But no solution was reached to these helpless people
 ulate netaaon kii hamadardi unka majaak uda gai
 Rahul Gandhi said in the election speech, "many boys of Muzaffarnagar are in touch with terrorist organizations
" ’’ to mulaayam singh yadav ne gusse main kah diya, ‘‘raahat shiviron main sharnaarthi nahin, bijepi or congress ke agent based hue hai
 "his statement not only hurt the victims again, but many people warned that such a rhetoric of the ruling Samajwadi Party president was hurting them
" sarkaar peediton ke prati apni asamvedansheeltaa se lagaataar apni kirakiri kara rahi he
 At first, he refused to believe that children had died of cold and disease in the relief camps, but an inquiry committee found that 34 children had died
 isi tarah use abhi tak ek darjan logon kii gumshudagi ke bare main kuch nahin pataa
 In such a situation, these Muslims are also seeing a ray of hope in Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party because Azam Khan, the biggest leader of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, has not reached here till date
 ulate ajam par danga bhadakaane ke aarope lag gaye
 Bahaul Hassan, who became a refugee from Pheri Wale, asked if Azam Khan was really behind the riots, so his real answer was, "he was accused of not allowing our help to come forward
" saare fasaad kii jad to (narendra) modi he
 You do not see that every riot victim hangs out a smiling banner of Saheb
 ’’ bahoul ne sangat acchhee bithai
 Most of the riot-hit villages have similar posters of Modi as the poster outside Fugana village
 bahoul kii tarah bahut se peediton ko lag rahaa he ki uttar pradesh main amit shah kii maujuudagi, unke liye shubh sanket nahin he
 But the BJP does not believe so
 party ke netaa hukum singh or sangeet som par dangon se jude aaropon ko party khaarij kar chuki he
 The administration has not yet been able to tell whether these riots were a well-planned conspiracy or the anger of two communities erupted suddenly
 (mujffarnagar ke ek raahat shivi main naarkeey jivan)masjid bol rahi helekin phugana kii badi masjid bahut kuch bataati he
 The dome of the mosque is complete, but the minarets have been hit
 neeche kaa puraa farsh ukhda hua he
 Communal abuses have been scratched on the walls
 jahaan pavitra granth rakhe hote the vah rack jala diya gaya
 The pit is dug at the place of worship under the dome
 aas-paas adhajali lakdigaan or raakh padi he
 His tau's son Gulfam, who accompanied Abid to the village, says, "the pit was built to perform havan
" ’’ unka ishaara yajna vedi kii taraf tha
 Many and even refugees mentioned the slogan that does not allow Abid to sleep peacefully
 zyaadaatar gaanvon main panchayat ke pehle musalamaanon ko ek-si dilasa di gai
 Can so many similarities be spontaneous? Says Gulfam, "today no one holds their father's hand for free, did people come out like this to set houses on fire?" Money was divided for this
 ’’ unka ishaara gahari sajeesh kii taraf he
 But meanwhile, a Jat boy who passed by there told this reporter, "where are you in a spin
" yah sab inkaa naatak he
 He set himself on fire in the house and himself uprooted the doors
 ab muaavje ke liye rishtedaaron ke saath camp main pade hai
 That is, the matter of conspiracy has made an equally deep penetration in the other party's mind
 us ilaake main jahaan babari masjid dhahaae jane ke samay bhi dange nahin hue the, is baar bahut tej jehar utraa he
 Most of the Muslims were landless and the riots also rendered them homeless
 jat-muslim sangharsh ne jaaton ke kheton main kaam kar roji-roti kamaane kii unki rahi sahi gunjaaish bhi khatm kar di he
 In such a situation, they want to live in a safe place where they live together
 sarkaar pasopesh main he-na to vah balpurvak in sharnaarthiyon ko hataa sakati he or na unhen thand main marane de sakati he
 The government also cannot tighten the majority of the Jats and cannot forcibly arrest the accused, because whenever the police tried to do so, the villagers strongly opposed it
 kai maamalon main to aropiyon ke bachaav main badi sankhya main mahilaayein aage aa gayi
 Apart from this, the local BJP leaders have also been pressuring the police not to enter the village forcibly, calling it a harassment of innocents
 (dange main tabah hue phugana gaanv ke baahar laga narendra modi or amit shah kaa binar)ghar vaapasi kii aakhri kiranin sari paristhitiyon main lagata he sharnaarthi or sarkaar ek-duusare ke jabt kaa imtahaan le rahe hai
 So is there no way to get drunk from the drunkard who left half a bottle of alcohol in Abid's burnt house? After a lot of scuffing, some aged refugees suggested a four-point formula of return to the village (see box for formula)
 vaise sarkaar ke liye is formule par amal karnaa naammumkin nahin he, kyonki yah formula haryana ke mirchpur main 2010 main dalit-jat sangharsh ke baad uthaae gaye kadamon se bahut kuch miltaa-julata he
 Now the entire Daromdar is on the young Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav

 The Lok Sabha on Monday approved the 'national Medical Commission Bill-2019' (national Medical Commission Bill 2019)
 sarkaar ne is par vipaksh ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki enemasi vidheyak nihit swaarthee tatwon kaa virdohi he jisamen rajyon ke adhikaron ko banaaye rakhte hue ekal khidki vaali medha aadhaarit paardarshee namakan prakriya ko badhaava dena sunishchit kiya gaya he
 Responding to the discussion on the National Medical Commission Bill 2019 in the lower house, Health and Family Welfare Minister Harsh Vardhan said that it is not correct to say that the National Medical Sciences Commission (NMC) Bill is against the federal form
 rajyon ko sanshodhan karne kaa adhikaar hoga, ve emoyu kar sakate hai
 Members of various opposition parties termed the bill against federal sentiment
 unhone kaha ki koi bhi college kii sthapana rajyon se jarurat aadhaarit praaanpatr praapt kiye bina nahin ho sakati he
 State governments will have a role in the registration of doctors
 medical collejon ke dainik kriyakalapon main centre sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin hogi
 Dr

 This will help in reducing Inspector Raj
 isamen hiton kaa takaraav rokane kii vyavastha kii gai he
 From the database of doctors, accuracy can be ensured
 '' The Union Minister said that the NMC Bill is a Lokonmukhi Bill
 isamen neem hakimon ko kadaa dand dene kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Following the minister's reply, dmk's A
 Raja demanded a division of opinion against the bill being taken forward for consideration and passage
 sadan ne 48 ke mukaable 260 maton se sarkaar ke prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya
 The House then approved the bill by voice, rejecting the amendments of some opposition members
 isse pehle congress ke sadasyon ne sadan se vakout kiya
 Keeping the bill for passage, Harsh Vardhan said that the Modi government is committed to provide quality healthcare to all and since 2014 steps are being taken in this direction
 unhone kaha ki bhartiya chikitsa parishad (emsiai) main lambey samay se bhrashtachar kii shikaayatein aa rahi thim
 a CBI investigation was also conducted in this case
 aise main is sanstha ke kayakalp kii jarurat hui
 RRB NTPC Exam Date: When will NTPC exams take place? Know what the railway official said mantri ne yah bhi kaha ki yah vidheyak itihaas main chikitsa ke kshetra ke sabase bade sudhaar ke rup main darj hoga
 Harsh Vardhan said that the Modi government follows a policy of not tolerating corruption at all and this bill has also been brought in the same spirit
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main sadan ko aashwaasan detaa hum ki vidheyak main ieme (bhartiya chikitsak sangh) kii uthaai gayi ashankaon kaa samaadhaan hoga
 Harsh Vardhan said that the NMC Bill is a progressive bill that will help overcome the challenges of medical education
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne vibhaag sambandhi sthai samiti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par vidheyak kaa masauda taiyaar kiya or ise pun: sthai samiti ko bheja gaya
 Again, most of the recommendations of the Standing Committee were accepted
 gauratlab he ki enemasi vidheyak main parasnatak medical paathyakramon main pravesh or marijon ke ilaaj hetu license hasil karne ke liye ek sanyukt antim varsh embibies pariksha (neshnal eczit test ‘next') kaa prastaav diya gaya he
 This exam will also serve as a screening test for foreign medical graduates
 pita kaa bete ko IAS banane kaa sapana, chachaa ke sahare hua saakaar Apart from the National Entrance Examination 'NEET', Joint Counseling and 'next' will also apply to institutions of national importance like AIIMS to set the same standard in the medical education sector in the country
 vidheyak ke uddeshyon evam kaarnon main kaha gaya he ki ayurvigyaan shiksha kisi bhi desh main acchhee swasthya dekharekh praapt karne ke liye mahatvapurn he
 a Standing Committee of Parliament in the Department of Health and Family Welfare in its 92nd report to restructure and reform the regulatory system of medical education and medical profession and Dr
 ranjit raay choudhary kii adhyakshata vaale vishesh samooh dwaara sujhaaye gaye viniamak dhaanche ke anusaar bhartiya ayurvigyaan parishad main sudhaar karne ke liye kadam uthaane kii sifarish kii
 The Supreme Court, in its decision in 2009 on 2 May 2016 in the case of Modern Dental College Research Center and others v
 State of Madhya Pradesh and others, directed the Central Government to consider the recommendations of the Rai Chaudhary Committee and take appropriate action
 in siforeeshon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue loksabhaa main 29 disambar 2017 ko rashtriya ayurvigyaan ayog vidheyak 2017 pun:sthapit kiya gaya tha, ise baad main vichararth sansad kii sthaayee samiti ko bhej diya gaya
 The Standing Committee later presented its report on the said bill
 samiti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par sarkaar ne 28 march 2018 ko loksabhaa main lambit vidheyak ke sambandh main aavashyak shaskeey sanshodhan prastut kiya tha lekin ise vichaar evam paarit kiye jane ke liye nahin laayaa ja sakaa
 It ended after the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha
 Byju's ke founder rabindran kabhi padhaate the skool main ab bane bharat ke nae arbapati The bill proposes to constitute four autonomous boards
 isamen snaatak purv or snatakottar ativishisht ayurvigyaan shiksha main pravesh ke liye ek saamaanya rashtriya paatrata sah pravesh (neet) pariksha yojit karne kii baat kahi gai he

 dilli kii takreeban aadha darjan sarkari coloniyon main reedeveopment ke naam par 16 hajaar se upar ped kaatane ke maamle main dilli hoicourt ne apane ste ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 Also, the High Court has given instructions to the NBCC and the Central Government
 court ne kaha ki ped kaatane kii tamaam anumatiyaan or construction project ko lekar apni puri ruparekha agali sunwaayee main court ke saamne pesh kii jaae
 The court also said that after the completion of this project, the problem of traffic jams will increase in the areas of South Delhi
 saath hi pani kii nikasi ko lekar bhi samasyaayein or gahari ho sakati hai
 However, defending its project, NBCC said that the biggest reason for increasing pollution in Delhi is crop burning and not construction
 is maamle main yachikakartaon ne apana paksh rakhte hue kaha ki is tarah ke project main pedo ko to kaat diya jaataa he
 But the promise of planting new trees is forgotten
 lihaaja jo ped cat jate hai, unke evaj main nai jagah plantesan nahin ho paata
 The next hearing in this case will now be held on 20 August
 yah sunwaayee enbisisi ke liye bhibehad ahamahogi kyonki enbisisi ko apane project se judi hui tamaam jaankariyaan or construction ko mili anumati kii sari baarikiyon ko court ke saath saajha karnaa hoga
 The Delhi High Court has also directed CPWD, NDMC Delhi Pollution Control Board, Delhi Jal Board and DDA to file their reply in the matter
 enbisisi pichley kuch vakt se sarojini nagar, netaji nagar, tyagaraj nagar, pragati maidan or kidawai nagar main do manjila puraani sarkari imaaraton ko todakar bahumanjila imaaraten bana rahi he
 For this, NBCC was cutting down trees of these areas
 lekin kuch enjio or sthaneey logon ke court menyachika laganeke baad pedo kii kataai par dilli hoicourt or engiti donon ne hi ste lagaaya hua he
 Today is World Dance Day

 After SP-BSP alliance, this seat is considered safe for SP
 haalanki akhilesh ke azamgarh seat se chunaav ladane ko lekar saarvajanik rup se sapa main kuch nahin kaha ja rahaa he, lekin andar khaane main party ise lekar gambhirtha ke saath manthan kar rahi he
 According to sources, if Akhilesh Yadav enters the election ground from Azamgarh seat, it will have an impact on many Lok Sabha seats in Purvanchal
 aise main unki patni dimple yadav kannauj se phir chunaav lard sakati hai
 Please tell that Akhilesh Yadav has already announced that Dimple will not contest from Kannauj this time
 is baar kannauj se akhilesh ke chunavi maidan main utarane kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 After the formation of SP-BSP alliance, the seat of Azamgarh is now considered the safest for SP and the most favorable seat for Akhilesh Yadav
 vahiin, is seat se saansad mulaayam singh yadav ne pehle hi azamgarh loksabhaa seat chhodane kaa elaan kar diya he
 This time he will contest from his traditional seat Mainpuri

 In this way, the talk of Akhilesh's entry into Azamgarh seat has intensified
 akhilesh yadav ne apni taraf se abhi tak azamgarh seat se chunaav ladane ko lekar koi ishaara nahin kiya he
 But there is a discussion within the party about Akhilesh's candidature
 aise main pradhanmantri narendra modi purvanchal kii varanasi se chunaav ladenge or akhilesh azamgarh se chunavi maidan main utar sakate hai
 In this way, the political contest of Purvanchal can be interesting

 net Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of demonetisation, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today alleged that the Prime Minister is working for a select few and he has no concern about the poor common man who is standing in queues outside banks and atms
 
 rahul ne sansad bhawan parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, main subah khud halaat dekhne ke liye bainkon tak gaya tha
 People there told me that they were having a lot of inconvenience
 notebandi ke mudde par vipakshi dalon ke virodh ke kaaran aaj donon sadanon kii kaarywahi kai baar sthagit kerani padi
 Rahul said that people are alleging that cash is being withdrawn from the back doors in banks for a select few, while the common man is standing in long queues
 unhone kaha, logon ne kaha ki ve kataron main khadey hai or saudebaaji ho rahi he tathaa pichley daravaaje se nakadi nikaali ja rahi he
 Cash is being given to a select few
 amiron ko nakadi mil rahi he or garibon ko kataron main khadaa kiya ja rahaa he
 According to Rahul, people will stand in queue for three days and then leave without cash
 rahul ne aaj subah shahar ke kai atm kaa daura kiya or logon se unki dikkaton ke bare main poocha
 On the question of Prime Minister not being present in the Parliament, Rahul said, what does the Prime Minister need to come to Parliament? These days he is on a different level
 naa to vah apane mantriyon se baatcheet karte hai or naa hi kisi anya se baat karte hai, jo unhen lagata he, khud se faisla kar lete hai
 He said, such a huge economic decision was taken in the history of the country and he did it after talking to three-four people
 koi yojana nahin thi
 What will happen to the farmers and the poor? kerala or bengal main machhlipaalan kaarobaar kaa kya hoga
 He did not think of these people
 piem modi par hamalaa bolte hue congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, in dinon vah nae rup main he
 You cannot even call them Super PM
 unhen paribhaashit karne ke liye sochna hoga
 To define them a new term has to be coined
 rahul ne ravivaar ko kanpur ke paas hui train durghatana main logon kii maut par shok-samvednaa bhi prakat kii or kaha ki pradhanmantri ko bullate train laane ke bajaay trainon main aam janata ke liye suvidha or suraksha badhaane par pehla dhyaan dena chahie
 The comments unhone kaha, bhartiya railway ke dhaanche ko durust karne kii jarurat he
 Modi ji spoke of bullet train with an investment of one lakh crore rupees
 galat jagah dhyaan he
 The focus should be on how safe it is for the general public to travel in trains
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 Rahul visited several atms in the city this morning and asked people about their problems
 sansad main pradhanmantri ke maujuud nahin rahane ke sawaal par rahul ne kaha, pradhanmantri ko sansad aane kii kya jarurat he? in dinon vah alag str par hai
 He neither talks to his ministers nor talks to any other, which he feels, decides on his own
 unhone kaha, desh ke itihaas main itnaa bada aarthik faisla liya gaya or unhone teen-chaar logon se baat karne ke baad yah kiya
 There was no plan
 kisaanon, garibon kaa kya hoga
 What will happen to the fisheries business in Kerala and Bengal? unhone in logon ke bare main nahin sochaa
 Attacking PM Modi, the Congress Vice President said, "these days he is in a new form
" aap unhen super piem bhi nahin bol sakate
 One has to think to define them
 unhen paribhaashit karne ke liye koi nayaa shabd gadhana hoga
 Rahul also expressed condolences over the death of people in a train accident near Kanpur on Sunday and said that instead of bringing bullet trains, the Prime Minister should focus first on increasing convenience and safety for the general public in trains
 tippaniyan He said, the structure of Indian Railways needs to be repaired
 modi ji ne ek lakh karod rupee ke nivesh ke saath bullate train kii baat kii

 a bench of Acting Chief Justice RS Jha and Justice VK Shukla issued these directions on Thursday
 saamaajik nyaay or ni:shaktajan kalyaan mantri ke liye pairvi kar rahe vakil jubin prasad ne pitiai-bhashaa ko shuukravaar ko bataaya ki chunki yachikakarta ne adaalat se kaha tha ki mantri ne atikaraman nahin hataane kaa apana bayaan utyub par aplod kiya tha, isliye adaalat ne mantri dwaara diye gayi apane spashtikaran kaa video bhi you-taub par aplod karne kaa nirdesh diya he
 It is noteworthy that hundreds of people have occupied Jabalpur including Madan Mahal and Siddha Baba hill

 Ghanghoria made a statement in favor of the encroachers during an event last month

 His statement was uploaded to youtube, making it viral on social media

 After this, the minister had a public meeting on October 1, giving an explanation for his statement on the encroachment among the public and apologized

 The election results of 652 urban local bodies of Uttar Pradesh were declared on 1 December
 yah ek durlabh avasar tha, jab mukhyamantri yogi adityanath lakhanu ke apane 5, kalidas maarg nivas se baahar nahin nikle
 Not until after three o'clock, they exited when the BJP was officially declared victorious in 14 out of the 16 big city municipal corporations
 uske baad hi mukhyamantri anya party netaaon ke saath jeet kaa jashn manaane ke liye baahar nikle
 During the election campaign, Yogi Adityanath searched the entire state and addressed more than 30 public meetings
 lakhanu, varanasi, elahabaad, kanpur, gorakhpur, agra, bareli, gajiabad, muradabad or jhaansi jaise puraane nigamon ke alaava bhaajapa ne chaaron nae nigamon—ayodhya, saharanpur, firozabad or mathuracrimein jeet darj kii
 Rishikesh Upadhyay of BJP defeated SP Gulshan Point in Ayodhya's first mayoral election
 haalanki mahatvapurn baat yah he ki basapa meerut or aligarh ke dangal main safal rahi, pashchimi uttar pradesh ke in donon mahatvapurn nigamon par pehle bhaajapa kaa kabja tha
 Although the party did not come anywhere near a "landslide victory", the party's national president Amit Shah claimed that the BJP has definitely improved its performance in the local body elections
 mahayor ke 14 padon ke alaava 1,299 nagar parshad ke padon main se 596 ab bhaajapa ke paas hai
 45 of the total posts of the corporation
 9 fisadi padon par ab bhaajapa kabiz he, jo 2012 ke nagar nikaay ke chunaavon main bhaajapa kii jiti gai siton se kareeb 15 fisadi zyada he
 It is noteworthy that BJP has done well in big cities
 yahaan tak ki 2012 main bhi bhaajapa ne 12 nagar nigamon main se 10 par jeet hasil kii thi
 But the picture of small towns in city councils, municipalities or nagar panchayats is not so rosy and it is known to both Chief Minister Adityanath and the party leadership
 bhaajapa ke liye raahat kii baat yah he ki vah bikhri hui vipakshi partiyon se milon aage he
 It is true that the BSP has made significant inroads, especially in western Uttar Pradesh and even Mayawati has allowed local leaders to carry out campaigning, but argues socialist Ajit Kumar of Banaras Hindu University, "this is Dalit- The success achieved by playing the Muslim card and essentially at the expense of the Samajwadi Party
 ''na to akhilesh yadav kii aguai vaali sapa or na hi rahul gandhi kii anupasthiti main chunaav lard rahi congress se kisi party ko koi phayda hua
 Taking a jibe at the Congress' humiliating defeat in Rahul's Lok Sabha constituency's two councils - Jais and Gauriganj, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, "those who talk of defeating the BJP in Gujarat lost the election in Amethi
" '' 45 nagarpalika parishadon main adhyakshata or nagar panchayaton main 83 siten jeetne ke baavjood samaajawaadee party ko bhi rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav ke putr akshay yadav ke loksabhaa main pratinidhitiv vaale firozabad main meyar kaa chunaav haarane kii sharmindagi jhelni padi
 Independents performed well like every municipal body election in Uttar Pradesh, especially in city councils and nagar panchayats
 224 parshadon ke alaava 225 nirdaleey ummidavaar nagarpalika parishad or nagar panchayat ke adhyaksh nirvaachit hue or 7,255 parshad or panchayat sadsy ke rup main chune gaye
 However, many of them belonged to political parties
 ab nirdaleey kis karavat baithenge, isaki tasviir aane vaale kuch hafton main saamne aegi
 The next day after the results were declared, Adityanath went to Delhi to meet the Prime Minister, to find out what the BJP insiders said as 'fame of good work'
 mana jaataa he ki is jeet se mukhyamantri protsaahan milegaa, rashtriya netritv ab un par or zyada bharosa karegaa or rajya chalaane ke liye unhen or swatantraaa milegi
 The immediate effect of this is that they may soon expand the cabinet to fill thirteen vacant posts in the cabinet
 is jeet se unhen sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main apane maujuuda mantriyon ke pradarshan kii samiksha karne kaa bhi avasar mila he, jinhen chunaav main jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 It will also include analysis of inconsistent performance in these elections and increase the representation of areas where the Bharatiya Janata Party has performed poorly
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye mushkil se ek varsh se thodaa zyada samay bachaa he, so adityanath chote nagarpalika shaharon par dhyaan kendrit karne main kotahi kii bharpai ke liye teji se kadam uthaa rahe hai
 In addition to a plan to compete with different districts competitively on various performance parameters (including trade facilitation on the lines of the Center), he has directed officials to prepare detailed development plans for semi-urban areas
 unhone rajya ke lok nirmaan vibhaag ko aise kshetron main sadakon kii sthiti par ek report taiyaar karne ke liye kaha he
 It seems that Yogis are determined to tackle the contradictions of strong aspects of state administration and the challenge of managing a big state like Uttar Pradesh
 big bos ke ghar kaa captain bananaa jaahir taur par big bos ke ghar kii sabase mjedaar cheez he
 There is a person at home who has been craving to become captain for the last 10 weeks

 These will be the people who have taken a stake in household work
 unhen naam likhakar ballat box main daalane honge

 During the hearing of the case, Chief Justice Khehar asked Abhishek Shukla's lawyer to come to the court with the police's Caesar Memo in this case and also tell how much were these seized notes? Significantly, Shukla was arrested by the Delhi Police in 2013 after Sreesanth was arrested from Mumbai
 police kaa aarope tha ki srisanth kii giraftaar ke baad shukla mumbai main unke hotel ke kamare main gaya or paisa va saamaan gaayab kar diya

 According to the BBC, the camera was found on a beach in Taiwan, covered with barnacles and shells
 camere ko pahchaanana kaaphi mushkil tha
 Even after so many years, this camera is still working very well
 hamen iske waterpruf system ko dhanyavad dena chahie, jisase yah ab tak surakshit he
 The camera was found by Park Lee and his teacher Park Lee, who decided to trace it back to its owner

 sabase ascharyajanak baat yah rahi ki jab ek chaatr ne ise chaalu kiya, tab bhi yah puri tarah se charge tha or thik se kaam kar rahaa tha
 Lee told the BBC that he was initially skeptical about how accurate it would be to see the photos captured in the camera and share them on Facebook, but it seems that this was the only chance to find the camera's owner

 camere ke maalik sirina tsubakihara ne apane fasebuk post main likhaa ki main abhi bhi is par vishwaas nahin kar paa rahi hum ki kya sach main aisa hua he

 avishwasaneey rup se pani kii ek boond bhi camere ke andar nahin gai, jabaki yah camera pani ke andar saikadon kilometre andar ja chukaa tha
 The most surprising thing is that even when a student switched it on, it was still fully charged and working properly
 lee ne bibisi se kaha ki unhen shuru main is baat par andeh tha ki camere main khinche photo ko dekhnaa or fasebuk par unhen saajha karnaa kitna sahi hoga, lekin aisa lagata he ki camere ke maalik ko khojane kaa yah ekmaatr mauka tha

 Tension has arisen once again between Lt Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind over the appointment of employees in Delhi government hospitals
 haalat yah he ki mukhyamantri ne uparajyapal ko patr likhakar adhikariyon ke bypass karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 He wrote that what is the reason that LG is speaking to the officials for not showing the file to the ministers and the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne chitthee main zikr kiya he ki unhone agast main dilli sarkaar ke aspataalon ke chikitsa adhikshakon ke saath ek baithak kii thi jahahospatalon main staff kii kameeki gambhir shikaayat mili thi
 On the basis of the complaint, it was decided by the CM that MS would have the right to appoint specialist on contract to fill the vacant posts of hospitals
 kejariwal ke mutabik unhone chif secretary ko alji se manjuuri lene ke nirdesh bhi die the
 In a letter sent to LG, Kejriwal has written an objection saying that when he asked the senior officials for the file to give the MS the authority, a surprise reply was received
 siem kejariwal ke mutabik senior adhikariyon ne yah kahkar fil nahin bheji kyonki unhen kisi mantri yasiem tak ko fil na dikhaneke alji se aadesh mili the
 At the moment, CM has demanded to send the file to LG
 siem kejariwal ke mutabik dilli sarkaar ke aspataalon main ventilator he lekin use sanchalit karne ke liye staff nahin he
 In addition, there is a shortage of staff to run machines like X-rays, CT scans and mris
 chitthee main siem khud daawa kar rahe hai ki sarkari aspataalon main dawa counter kii kami hone kii badi vajah pharmacist na hona he
 CM Kejriwal has demanded from LG that they fill all the vacant posts in hospitals as soon as possible

 Pandit Ravi Shankar was the music ambassador of India and was a masterpiece of classical music
 unka janm 7 april 1920 ko varanasi main hua tha
 He composed many new ragas
 ve rajya sabha ke bhi sadsy rahe
 Pandit Ravi Shankar was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1999
 apane sitar vaadan ke jariye pandit ravishankar ko bhartiya sangeet ko pashchimi duniya tak pahunchane kaa shrey praapt he
 Three-time Grammy Award winner Pandit Ravi Shankar was also nominated for the 55th Grammy Awards this year
 unhen unke elbum ‘da living room sijans part-1’ ke liye namankit kiya gaya he
 Along with her in the Best Music Album category, her daughter Anushka has also been nominated for the album 'traveler'
 mashhoor gazal lekhak alok shrivastav ne unke nidhan par shok prakat karte hue kaha, ‘unhone hi pehali baar puri duniya ko bataaya ki bharat kaa sangeet puri duniya ke saath kadamtal kar saktaa he
 His death has caused irreparable damage not only to India but to the whole world
 ’pandit ravishankar ne pashchimi deshon ko bharat ke sangeet se rubaru karaayaa
 With his demise, it seems as if there is a huge fire in the world of music
 shaayad 21 disambar ko duniya khatm hone kii ashanka se pehle sangeet kii duniya ujaad gai
 Pandit Ravi Shankar had been ill for some time and had gone for operation in America

 Jet Airways aircraft engineer Prashant Pandey's death on March 17 in kaudiyala-muni's Reti Eco Tourism Zone near Rishikesh has left many questions behind
 mul rup se betia, bihar ke rahane vaale prashanth kii maut rafting karte hue wal rapid (chattan, jahaan tej raftaar main aakar pani takaraata he) main raft takaraane ke baad palatney se hui
 There have been three subsequent accidents on Wall Rapid in a week
 15 march ko hue ek anya haadase main argentina ke 32 varshiya payrtak kii bhi maut ho gai
 Do these deaths question the safety and precautions associated with rafting? Obviously, the government and rafting businessmen are not willing to consider it as anything more than a risk for adventure sports
 aprashikshit rafting guide or helper, rafting ke liye aane vaale mahanagaron ke dussahsee noujvaan, rafting kaarobaariyon kaa laalach or sarkaar kii beparwahee isse jude jokhim ko badha rahe hai
 Rishikesh is called the mecca of river rafting and thousands of adventure lovers arrive here every year for rafting
 lekin na to sarkaar ab tak cheti he or na rafting kaarobaari suraksha ke puure upaay kar paae hai
 The lives of domestic and foreign tourists are being put at risk by using improvised safety equipment along with untrained and young guides
 garmi kaa mausam shuru hote hi ek baar phir paryatak white water rafting ke liye aa rahe hai or phir unki jaan jokhim main he
 Even after 12 years of Uttarakhand state formation, no policy has been made for rafting here
 sab kuch uttar pradesh sarkaar dwaara 25 sitambar, 1999 ko river rafting ke liye jari shasnadesh ke aadhaar par hi chal rahaa he
 Whereas in a decade, the river rafting business has gone far ahead
 saahasik paryaton rafting samiti ke sachiv, 29 varshiya anuraag payaal kehete hai, ‘‘1984-85 main jab rishikesh main rafting kaa kaam shuru hua, tab yahaan sirf 2-3 companiyaan thim or sirf videshi paryatak hi rafting karne ke liye aate the
 But today there are 140 registered rafting companies and around 500 rafting booking counters
 ’’ rafting kii harasat isliye bhi adventure lovers ko khinch laati he kyonki yahaan aath maheene kaa sabase lanbaa rafting sijan hota he
 The 40 km long rafting area of kaudiyala-rishikesh and 4-5 grade sharp streams add to this attraction
 rishikesh main 1 sitambar se 30 june tak rafting sijan hota he
 During this time more than one lakh tourists reach for river rafting
 begaa board adventure ke diarector 40 varshiya narendra negi kehete hai, ‘‘sijan shuru hone ke pehle teen maheene weekend main 8 se 10,000 tourist rafting ke liye aate hai
 "out of the 140 registered companies engaged in rafting, 40 are from delhi-ncr big businessmen
 rishikesh main 500 se adhik raft chalate hai
 The Department of Tourism and Forests jointly licenses running rafts
 lekin license dene kii sust prakriya or rafting kii monitering kaa koi dhaancha na ban paane ke kaaran hi paryatakon kii jaan jokhim main he
 Srinagar resident and Senior Scientific Officer of State Science and Technology Council, Dr
 arun kuksaal kehete hai, ‘‘devbhumi hone ke kaaran devtaa hi yahaan paryatakon kii jaan bachaa rahe hai
 "there is an open violation of the rules of rafting in Rishikesh
 kuksaal sawaal karte hai ki jo ladke rafting guide hai, unhone kahaan training lee he? mountain guide banane ke liye bhi parvatarohan kaa basic, advance, search and rescue course karnaa jaruri hota he
 Also it is necessary to take a course of mountain guide
 antarrashtriya niyamon ke mutabik, rafting guide ke liye bhi basic rafting or water search and rescue jaise course jaruri hai, lekin yahaan rafting guide ke liye prashikshan kii koi pahal ab tak nahin hui he
 Negi says that such boys are becoming guides for employment, who do not even have basic training
 akushal shramik hone ke kaaran unka paarishramik bhi kam hota he
 Rafting companies pay Rs
 400-1,000 per one man for every 16 to 32 km of rafting
 vasuul karti hai
 Only seven people are allowed to sit in each raft, while 10-12 people are easily accommodated by overloading
 ek company ke paas kam-se-kam do raft hai
 There are more than 15 such companies, with an average of 10 rafts
 sijan main prati raft do phere lagaana saamaanya baat he
 In such a situation, the economics of these companies can be better understood
 do raft vaali choti company bhi keval do phere lagane par nunatam 5,000 ru
 It earns kamai ne kaarobaar kii hode ko kai guna badha diya he
 At present, while 140 companies are engaged in the business of rafting, after May 2010, no new rafting company has been allowed by the government
 paryaton sachiv umakant panvar kehete hai, ‘‘sarkaar rafting ko lekar nai guidelins ko antim rup de rahi he
 Only then will new companies be allowed
 ’’ nai companiyon par sarkaar kii aapatti yah he ki unke paas trend guide nahin hai, jabaki panvar ke paas is baat kaa koi jawaab nahin he ki jo companiyaan abhi kaam kar rahi hai, unke gidon ne kahaan se prashikshan liya he
 On the one hand, to become a Mountaineering Guide, many world class institutions have been opened from the Center to the State Government, while shortcuts have been selected to become a rafting guide
 jis helper ke sir par rafting association ne haath rakh diya, vah guide ho gaya
 As per the current rule, while applying, the rafting company has to provide details of its equipment as well as two rafting guides and helpers
 yah byora rafting association, van vibhaag or sthaneey paryaton adhikariyon se pramanit hota he
 The government did not take any initiative of training the rafting guides but the Indian Association of Professional Rafting Outfitters (IPRO) has campaigned to train the guides
 march, 2013 ke tisare hafte main do dinon kaa training camp chalaakar ipro ne gidon ko guide minar ke saath hi risk management kii bhi training di
 Kiran Bhatt Todaria, president of ipro and rafting business since 1987, says, "we are doing our best to make the business grow and the business will only grow if our guides meet international standards
" gidon ko ham medical help or rescue training bhi dene ja rahe hai
 The pattern of becoming a guide so far has been that after being a helper with another guide for a few months, companies keep it as a guide in their rafts
 nae guide puraane ke mukaable saste bhi hote hai
 Dharmendra Negi, Chairman of Adventure Tourism Rafting Committee does not mind it
 unka kahana he ki yah guru-shishy parampara jaisaa he, jahaan senior apane junior helparon ko guide kaa kaam sikhaate hai
 But in reality even those gurus have never taken training of rafting guides
 kai guide to is baat ko sweekaar bhi karte hai
 "I single-handedly carry eight people in my raft," says 18-year-old Pramod Dhoundiyal of the Trans Himalaya Company's guide
 maine trans himalaya company main hi teen-chaar maheene training lee he
 Never taken any professional rafting training
 ’’ aisi hi ek adventure company main bataur raft helper kaam kar rahaa nepali yuvak 20 varshiya prakaash helper banane se pehle kabhi raft par baitha tak nahin tha
 And after working as a helper for a few months, he will now become a guide
 in donon yuvakon ko pratimah kramash: 5,000 ru
 And Rs 2,000
 vetan miltaa he
 It is clear that companies are also keeping guides to less experienced youth to save money
 is samay rishikesh main takreeban 15,000 log rafting ke kaarobaar se jude hai, isliye yah jaruri ho gaya he ki isse jude suraksha upayon ko gambhirtha se liya jaae
 Otherwise, it is possible that foreign tourists, as well as foreign tourists, should be able to enjoy the flowing streams of the Ganges

 "naidu said that no front at the national level is possible without the Congress party
 tidipi pramukh ne kaha ki 10 disambar ko gaiyr-bijepi dalon kii baithak main bhavishya kii yojana par charchaa kiya jayega
 He said that he is in touch with Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati

 Naidu did not say whether he was in touch with Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik

 In Chhattisgarh, the Congress vowed to take Ganga water, that it would forgive farmers' debt within ten days if the state came to power
 party ke bade netaaon se lekar chote netaaon ko bhi maa ganga kii kasam khaakar kisaanon ko yakeen dilaanaa pad rahaa he ki wo kisaanon ke saath jhuthe vaade nahin kar rahe hai
 At the same time, the BJP argues that even though the Congress swears on the Ganges water, the farmers will not come in their bluff
 raipur main congress mukhyalay rajeev bhawan main congress ke tamaam netaaon ne saughandh khai ki satta main ai to das dinon ke bheetar unka karj maaf kar diya jayega
 The Congress in its party manifesto in the state has also cited that if the party comes to power, the farmers' debt will be waived first
 congress ke is vaade se kisaan gadgad hai, lekin unhen yakeen nahin ho rahaa he ki vaaki congress party apane vaade ko nibhaayegi
 The farmers' experience regarding the promises of political parties has not been good, so they are considering not only the manifesto of the Congress but also the promises of its leaders as a sham
 vahiin bijepi ne bhi kisaanon kii karj maafee kaa daawa kiya he
 The party argues that Chief Minister Raman Singh has run more than one such scheme for the welfare of farmers, so that farmers do not have to take loans
 party ne yah bhi kaha he ki rajya kii raman singh sarkaar ne har saal saadhe teen lakh se zyada kisaanon kaa karj maaf kiya he
 Confuse farmers with BJP and Congress promises: In view of this, there is confusion among farmers whether to believe bjp's promise or Congress
 darasal, in kisaanon ke saath bijepi ne bhi pichhalavidhansabha chunaavamein vaada kiya tha ki wo dhan ke samarthan mulya 21 sau rupee prati quintal tak badhotaree karegi
 At the same time, a bonus of Rs 300 per quintal will also be given
 yahi nahin bijepi ne yah bhi vaada kiya tha ki kisaan kii fasal kaa dana dana liya jayega
 But when the party came to power, the support price of paddy increased by just Rs 300
 dhan kaa samarthan mulya 1450 rupee se badhkar 1750 rupee ho gaya
 But the promise was not 2100 rupees
 haalanki mukhyamantri raman singh ne bijepi ke vaade ke anurup puure paanch saal tak bonus dene ke bajaae maatr 3 saal tak kaa hi bonus diya or to or kisaanon ke fasal kaa ek ek dana lene ke bajaae prati acre maatr 15 quintal dhan hi kisaanon se kharida gaya
 In such a situation, farmers are looking at both Congress and BJP parties with suspicion
 bataa den kichhattisgarhmen badi aabaadi kheti kisaani se judi he
 There are about 20 lakh registered farmers in the state while the number of non registered farmers is more than 15 lakhs
 kisaanon or unke parivaar ke voton ko hathiyaane ke liye koi bhi rajnatik dal peeche nahin he
 Whether it is small parties or big parties, leaders are of national level or local everyone is engaged in wooing and persuading the farmers

 tippaniyan Vani said at a fashion event that she felt from the beginning that she was the most risqué in the film
 vaani ne kaha, "mujhe shuru se hi lag rahaa tha ki film main main sabase zayaada riski hum or sabase badi baaji mere upar lagi he kyonki team ke baaki sabhi logon ne kaaphi kuch pehle hi hasil kar liya he

 Aditya Chopra chose me, so i think if this film did not do its job, i am the reason for it
 " Vani also believes that 'befikre' has become ahead of its time, showing a new-age love
 vaani ne ek fishan event main kaha ki unhen shuru se hi lag rahaa tha ki film main vah sabase zyada riski hai
 Vani said, "from the beginning i felt that i am the most risky in the film and the biggest bet is on me because all the rest of the team has already achieved a lot
 apana naam or makaam bana liya he
 i was new on which the risk was taken whether the audience would adopt or not

 ' bukkal nawab kehete hai ki kareeb 100 naam aise hai, jo hanumanji par hi aadhaarit hai

 Delhi Police on Saturday tried to interfere in the press conference of Aam Aadmi Party candidate Balbir Singh Jakhar
 police kaa kahana he ki yah adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he
 However, Jakhar held a press conference despite the police's intervention, after which the police informed the election officials about this
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki dilli ke mukhya chunaav adhikari (siio) police ko pashchimi dilli loksabhaa seat se ‘aap' ummidavaar jakhad ke khilaaf aupchaarik shikaayat darj karne kaa nirdesh de sakate hai
 Jakhar held a press conference during the 48-hour period before the vote
 ‘aap' ne jakhad kaa bachaav karte hue kaha ki samvaadadaata sammelan main pashchim dilli se unke ummidavaar ne na to janata se vot kii apil kii or na hi party kaa chunaav chihn dikhaaya
 The party says that this press conference was done by taking a video running on social media

 After this, the policemen also tried to record the video but they were not allowed to enter and the doors were locked
 ek varisht police adhikari ne bataaya ki chunaav se 48 ghante pehle chunaav prachaar tham jaataa he or ‘aap' kaa yah kaarykram aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan he
 He said that he informed the Election Commission of this
 samvaadadaata sammelan main jakhad ne apane bete ke daawey se inkaar kiya or kaha ki vah apane bete se alag ho chuke hai

 main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra kaa kooda hum
 i have seen with great pride on these roads that ever since our MP Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of the country, since then till today, in one year, ministers and cabinet level secretaries have visited almost 129 times
 in dauron main sirf desh hi nahin, balki kioto japan ke bhi log yahaan aakar daura kar chuke he or har daure main ve hajaaron karod kii ghoshnaa ke saath hamaare apane shahar ko duniya ke nakshe par number ek banane kaa daawa kar gaye
 But perhaps these people are so immature or do not understand that i am not a garbage city
 main to pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra kaa kooda hum
 There is courage in anyone to give us a hand, while the Municipal Corporation has 2700 scavengers ready to remove us, with the entire LAC of JCB, Dumper, Dumper Cressor, Tanker, Hopper and Chota Hopper
 baavzood iske koi hamen apni jagah se hilaa nahin paata
 All that one can do is pick up from one place to fill the other place and we take this walk very happily because we know that for us, he has maintained the dumping plant, in which the operation of Karsara Dumping Plant It is at a standstill and the road to Ramna dumping plant is bad as well as the villagers will not let us come
 hamaara apana vajood hamaare apane shahar kii sankari galiyon main bhi khub faltaa-phulataa he, kyonki in galiyon main hamen (kooda) rakhane ke liye khaali jagah nahin milti
 So there is a problem in keeping the container as well
 or safaikarmi to bas khanaapurti karte hai
 In such a situation, i have to taunt with great fun
 haa, pichley saal kuch samay ke liye hamen pareshaani hui thi
 When the Etuz were picking us up from house to house and taking them away from our favorite city and streets
 tab thodi ghabrahat hui thi par man main ek nishcintata bhi thi ki ye sab zyaada din nahin chal paaegaa, kyonki ham jaanate the ki nagar nigam ke bhrasht adhikari, netaa, parshad paise ke chakkar main atuged kii aisi fajihat karenge ki vah bhaag khadaa hoga
 And the same thing happened
 ab har roj hamen hataane ke liye nai-nai scimen banati hai, paisa aata he or bant jaataa he
 On the other hand, officers and leaders are happy in the name of removing us and here we are happy to spread our empire on the streets
 aisa nahin ki hamen apane vajood par kabhi khatra mahasoos nahin hua
 When our MP became Prime Minister, he spoke about cleanliness in a big way
 banaras aae to khud jhaadoo bhi lagane lage
 Not only this, he also declared his cleaning Navratna here
 shuru main in navratnon main josh bhi dikhaa
 They also declared their own Navratna, a little scared in the mind, but on one hand there was certainty that the way these Navratnas were taking a little sweep and taking more photos, it was only then that they could remove us
 yah baat sach nikali
 Where is all these photobots today, nobody worries lihaaja, hamaara apana vajood har jagah kaayam he
 The benefit of the pm's parliamentary constituency is not only for us, but there is also plenty of water in our friend's sewer
 ham to ek jagah hi pade rahete hai
 From there we see the whole scene, but the pipe line is broken in place of our friend Sewer Rani, she goes out on the streets and then walks through the pipes of the water that is being supplied to the houses
 siver mili pani ko log pine ke liye majboor hai
 The interesting thing is that there is no one to stop it too, because the officials of the Jal Sansthan have sent a plan of crores of rupees to stop it and are waiting to see when this money will come in five to ten years
 tab tak isaki marammat ke naam par apni jholii bhar rahe hai
 Anyway, the sewer pipeline being laid under JNURM also does not make any sense, because the land for the STP that will take this pipeline to STP is not available yet
 lihaaja bhale hi iske liye karodon rupee aa gaye hon par ham logon kii mouj main koi khalal nahin daal saktaa
 Aam Aadmi Party workers growing paddy on the road hamaari is mouj main hamaare ek saathi kii badi madad he
 That fellow is the road, which makes big pits on our roads to give us shelter, in which we and our friends get a great chance to relax the sewer water
 ab to sadakon par ye gadhde aise ho gaye hai ki sadak bamushkil dikhti he
 There were many sit-ins to correct this
 akhabaaron main bhi niklaa par kisi kii itani taakat hi nahin ki ise banavaa sake
 The comments abhi haal hi main aam aadmi party vaale aise hi gadde main barsaat kaa pani bharaa hone par usamen dhan kaa behan ropakar virodh jataa rahe the
 We had pity on his intelligence that this is not Delhi, where his government is
 phir jahaan unki sarkaar he vahiin unki nahin chal rahi to ye to hamaare pradhanmantri ji kaa sansadeey kshetra he
 What will these people do here? ant main yahi kehane ko ji chahta he ki hamaari kaashi to shiv kii nagari he, yahaan kan-kan main shankar he
 Poets and poets have expressed its unique glory in their own style

 Despite this no one can move us from his place
 bas itnaa kar paata he ki ek jagah se uthaakar duusari jagah kii saiyr bhar kara detaa he or is saiyr ko ham bade maje se isliye karte hai ki hamen pataa he ki hamaare liye, jo inhone damping plant bana rakhaa he usamen karsada damping plant kaa sanchaalan thap he or ramana damping plant kaa rasta to kharaab he hi saath hi vahaan ke gramin hi hamen nahin aane denge
 Our own existence also thrives in the narrow streets of our own city, because in these streets we do not get free space to keep (garbage)
 lihaaja container rakhane main bhi fajihat he
 And the scavengers just do the cleaning
 aise main main bade maje se seenaa taane padaa hum
 Yes, we had some problems last year
 jab atuged vaale ghar-ghar se hamen uthaa kar hamaare apane priy shahar or galiyon se dur le jaakar nistarit kar rahe the
 There was a little panic then, but there was also a certainty in my mind that all these days would not go on, because we knew that corrupt municipal officials, leaders, councilors would be tempted to run for money in such a way that he would run away
 or hua bhi vahi
 Now every day new schemes are made to remove us, money comes and gets distributed
 udhar, hamen hataane ke naam par adhikari or netaa mast hai or idhar ham sadakon par apana samrajya failaae magan hai
 It is not that we have never felt threatened by our existence
 jab hamaare saansad pradhanmantri bane to unhone swatchta kii baat bade joro se kahi
 When Banaras came, he started sweeping himself
 itnaa hi nahin unhone yaheen par apane safai ke navratna bhi ghoshit kar die
 Initially, there was enthusiasm in these Navratnas
 inhone bhi apane-apane navratna ghoshit kar die to thodaa man main dar laga, par ek taraf nischitanta yah thi ki ye navratna jis tarah thodaa-sa jhaadoo lagaakar photo zyada khinchvaa rahe the, tabhi laga ki ye hamen kya hataa paaenge
 This thing came true
 aaj ye sab photobaj kahaan he, kisi ko nahin chintaa
 Therefore, our own existence remains everywhere
 piem ke sansadeey kshetra kaa hone kaa phayda sirf hamen hi nahin he balki hamaari saheli siver ke pani kii bhi khub mouj he
 We stay in one place only
 vahiin se sara najaara dekhte hai, par hamaari saheli siver rani kii jagah-jagah pipe line tuuti he, vah baahar nikalakar sadakon par or phir vahaan se gharon main jo pani kii supplai ja rahi he uske pipe ke jariye saiyr karti he
 People are forced to drink sewer water
 maje kii baat yah he ki ise bhi rokane vaala koi nahin, kyonki jal santhaan ke adhikari ise rokane ke liye karodon rupee kii yojana banaakar bhej chuke hai or is baat ke intazaar main hai ki jab paanch das saal main yah paisa aayega tab dekha jayega
 Until then, they are filling their bags in the name of repair
 vaise bhi jeenyuarem ke tahat jo siver pipe line daali ja rahi hai, uske bhi koi myne nahin hai, kyonki is pipe line ko jis astipi tak le jaaenge us astipi ke liye abhi jameen hi nahin mil pai he
 So even though crores of rupees have come for this, we cannot disturb the fun of people
 sadak par dhan ugaate aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta One of our companions is a big help in this fun
 vah saathi he sadak, jo hamen panaah dene ke liye apni sadakon par bade-bade gadhde bana detaa he, jisamen ham or hamaari saheli siver ke pani ko aaraam karne kaa bada mauka mil jaataa he
 Now these pits on the roads have become such that the road is barely visible
 ise thik karne ke liye khub dharna-pradarshan hue
 It turned out even in the newspapers, but no one can get enough of it to be made
 tippaniyan Recently, the Aam Aadmi Party was protesting by planting a lot of paddy in the same pit when the rainy water is full
 unki is buddhi par hamen taras aa rahaa tha ki ye koi dilli nahin he, jahaan unki sarkaar he
 Then where their government is there, they are not running, then this is the Parliamentary constituency of our Prime Minister
 yahaan bhala ye log hamaara kya kar paaenge
 In the end, it wants to say that our Kashi is the city of Shiva, here in every particle there is Shankar
 isaki isi niraali mahima ko kavi or shaayaron ne apane-apane andaaj main bayaan kiya he
 a poet has written in this episode that "the city that is owned by Paras is the city of Benaras"
 These lines must have been written by the poet realizing the strange kashish flowing in the fijas of this city, in which any spiritual power It is realized, but it seems that the rulers of our day have understood the garbage like we are philosophers and that is why we are not able to remove it
 hamaara apana vajood hamaare apane shahar kii sankari galiyon main bhi khub faltaa-phulataa he, kyonki in galiyon main hamen (kooda) rakhane ke liye khaali jagah nahin milti
 So there is a problem in keeping the container as well
 or safaikarmi to bas khanaapurti karte hai
 In such a situation, i have to taunt with great fun

 The interesting thing is that there is no one to stop it too, because the officials of the Jal Sansthan have sent a plan of crores of rupees to stop it and are waiting to see when this money will come in five to ten years
 tab tak isaki marammat ke naam par apni jholii bhar rahe hai
 Anyway, the sewer pipeline being laid under JNURM also does not make any sense, because the land for the STP that will take this pipeline to STP is not available yet
 lihaaja bhale hi iske liye karodon rupee aa gaye hon par ham logon kii mouj main koi khalal nahin daal saktaa
 Aam Aadmi Party workers growing paddy on the road hamaari is mouj main hamaare ek saathi kii badi madad he
 That fellow is the road, which makes big pits on our roads to give us shelter, in which we and our friends get a great chance to relax the sewer water
 ab to sadakon par ye gadhde aise ho gaye hai ki sadak bamushkil dikhti he
 There were many sit-ins to correct this
 akhabaaron main bhi niklaa par kisi kii itani taakat hi nahin ki ise banavaa sake
 The comments abhi haal hi main aam aadmi party vaale aise hi gadde main barsaat kaa pani bharaa hone par usamen dhan kaa behan ropakar virodh jataa rahe the
 We had pity on his intelligence that this is not Delhi, where his government is
 phir jahaan unki sarkaar he vahiin unki nahin chal rahi to ye to hamaare pradhanmantri ji kaa sansadeey kshetra he
 What will these people do here? ant main yahi kehane ko ji chahta he ki hamaari kaashi to shiv kii nagari he, yahaan kan-kan main shankar he
 Poets and poets have expressed its unique glory in their own style
 ek shaayar ne isi kadi main likhaa he ki " khak bhi jis jameen kaa paras he, wo shahar banaras he" in linon ko shaayar ne is shahar kii phijaaon main bah rahi us ajeeb-si kashish ko mahasoos kar likhaa hoga, jisame kisi ruhani taaqat kaa ahsaas hota he, par lagata he ki hamaare aaj ke hukmran ham jaise kooday ko hi paras samaj baithe hai isiilie hamen hataa nahin paa rahe
 It is not that we have never felt threatened by our existence
 jab hamaare saansad pradhanmantri bane to unhone swatchta kii baat bade joro se kahi
 When Banaras came, he started sweeping himself
 itnaa hi nahin unhone yaheen par apane safai ke navratna bhi ghoshit kar die
 Initially, there was enthusiasm in these Navratnas
 inhone bhi apane-apane navratna ghoshit kar die to thodaa man main dar laga, par ek taraf nischitanta yah thi ki ye navratna jis tarah thodaa-sa jhaadoo lagaakar photo zyada khinchvaa rahe the, tabhi laga ki ye hamen kya hataa paaenge
 This thing came true
 aaj ye sab photobaj kahaan he, kisi ko nahin chintaa
 Therefore, our own existence remains everywhere
 piem ke sansadeey kshetra kaa hone kaa phayda sirf hamen hi nahin he balki hamaari saheli siver ke pani kii bhi khub mouj he
 We stay in one place only
 vahiin se sara najaara dekhte hai, par hamaari saheli siver rani kii jagah-jagah pipe line tuuti he, vah baahar nikalakar sadakon par or phir vahaan se gharon main jo pani kii supplai ja rahi he uske pipe ke jariye saiyr karti he
 People are forced to drink sewer water
 maje kii baat yah he ki ise bhi rokane vaala koi nahin, kyonki jal santhaan ke adhikari ise rokane ke liye karodon rupee kii yojana banaakar bhej chuke hai or is baat ke intazaar main hai ki jab paanch das saal main yah paisa aayega tab dekha jayega
 Until then, they are filling their bags in the name of repair
 vaise bhi jeenyuarem ke tahat jo siver pipe line daali ja rahi hai, uske bhi koi myne nahin hai, kyonki is pipe line ko jis astipi tak le jaaenge us astipi ke liye abhi jameen hi nahin mil pai he
 So even though crores of rupees have come for this, we cannot disturb the fun of people

 uttar pradesh main narendra modi ke vijay rath ko rokane main pehle vidhansabha chunaav main 'upi ke ladke' (akhilesh yadav -rahul gandhi) fail hue
 After this, in the Lok Sabha elections, the pair of aunt-nephew (akhilesh-mayawati) is also seen to be a complete failure
 ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole (exit Poll) ke mutabik desh ke sabase bade soobe uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan par narendra modi-amit shah kii jodi kaaphi baari najar aa rahi he
 Interestingly, except for just one exit poll, the grand alliance is losing in all the surveys
 bataa den ki do dashak puraani dushmani ko bhulaakar basapa adhyaksh mayawati ne samaajawaadee party ke saath haath milakar chunavi maidan main utari thi
 It was believed that the akhilesh-mayawati duo would completely block Narendra Modi's Ashwamedha Rath in the state, but the exit poll after the seventh phase of voting showed all their intentions in the water
 ajtak- exis maai india kaa agsit pole (exit Poll) main soobe kii 80 loksabhaa siton main se bijepi gathbandhan ko 62-68 siten milti hui najar aa rahi hai
 While the SP-BSP-RLD alliance is seen getting 10 to 16 seats and the Congress getting 1 to 2 seats
 bijepi ko akele 60 se 66 siten or apana dal ko 2 siten mil rahi hai
 While SP is getting 4 to 7 seats and BSP is getting 3 to 7 seats
 vahiin0, congress ko ek se do siten mil rahi hai
 Looking at the vote share in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP alliance is getting 48 percent of the vote
 jabaki sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan ko 39 fisadi vot mil rahaa he
 At the same time, the Congress is getting only 8 percent and others are getting 5 percent
 is tarah se sapa-basapa ke dalit, yadav or muslim maton kaa sameekaran koi asar dikhaata nahin najar aa rahaa
 Whereas bjp's 50 per cent claims seem to be true
 uttar pradesh ko lekar baaki agsit pole ke nattijeychankya today-endie 65, mahagathbandhan 13, congress 2pole street- endie 38, mahagathbandhan 40, congress 2si voter-endie 38, mahagathbandhan 40, congress 2sienex-endie 50, mahagathbandhan 28, congress-2ipsos-endie-60-62, mahagathbandhan 17-19, congress 1-2viemr- endie 56, mahagathbandhan 20, congress 2nilsan- endie22, gathbandhan 56,congress 2bataa den ki akhilesh yadav ne uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan kar chunavi maidan main utre the
 At that time, the pair of Akhilesh and Rahul Gandhi was given the slogan of UP boy
 lekin soobe kii janata ne chunaav main rahul-akhilesh kii jodi nakaar diya tha
 Both the Congress and the SP lost badly

 ke daayre main aane vaali sabhisharab kii dukanonko band kiya jayega, is faisle ko cabinet kii manjuuri mil chuki hai
 According to the Excise Department, there are about 57 shops within the 5 km radius of the Narmada river in the state, to which this decision will apply
 narmada ke udgam se lekar gujarat kii seemaa main daakhil hone tak narmada mandla, jabalpur, narsinghpur, hoshangabad, harda, khandwa, dhar, khargun zilon se hokar guzarati he
 However, it was not easy for Shivraj Singh Chauhan to take this decision as the closure of these shops is likely to cause a loss of about Rs 100 crore to the state exchequer
 kya madhyapradesh main bhi hogi purna sharabbandi?narmada kinare kii sharaab dukaanon ko band kiye jane ke elaan ke saath hi ye sugabugahat bhi shuru ho gayi he ki gujarat or bihar ke baad kya madhyapradesh main bhi purna sharabbandi lagu hogi
 Because CM Shivraj has clearly said that not only shops on the banks of Narmada will be closed, but now the government will also carry out de-addiction campaign so that people can get rid of the habit of drug addiction
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki kya sarkaar uske khazaane par itnaa bada ghaataa uthaaegi kyonki aankadon kii maane to sarkaar ko pichley saal aabkaari vibhaag se 7 hajaar karod rupee se bhi zyada kii aay hui he

 Shah Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia issued a royal decree on Tuesday allowing women to drive in the country
 'neuyark times' kii report ke anusaar, is faisle ne lambey samay se chali aa rahi us dirghakaalik niti ko ulat diya he jo atyantaroodhiwaadee desh main mahilaonke daman kaa vaishvik pratik ban gai thi
 This decision, however, will not be implemented immediately as there is no infrastructure for women in the country to learn driving or obtain driving license
 report ke anusaar, police ko mahilaon ke saath us tareeke se baatcheet karne ke liye prashikshit karne kii jarurat hogi jis tareeke se shaayad hi is samaaj main anjaan purushon or mahilaon ke bich baatcheet hoti he
 For years Saudi clerics have been citing a number of reasons for women to ban driving, one of which claims to have damaged the ovaries of driving women
 is pratibandh ko radd karne ke liye vibhinn adhikaar sanghathanon dwaara lambey samay tak abhiyaan chalaaya gaya, jis dauraan driving karne ko lekar kai mahilaon ko giraftaar kiya gaya or jail bhej diya gaya
 This recent order shows how Saudi is trying to improve its image, which was spoiled by not allowing women to drive in public
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki videshon main saudi arab kii chhavi par hone vaale prabhaavon ke alaava mahilaon ko driving karne dene ke peeche kaa makasad saudi arthvyavastha main sudhaar karnaa he, jisamen mahila chaalak madadgaar ho sakati hai
 Low oil prices have limited government jobs, which Saudi Arabia has long depended on, and the country is now trying to provide gainful employment to more and more citizens, including women

 haalanki kaaphi baad main ise public kiya gaya or ise sabhi ke liye pesh kiya gaya
 This app company is going to finish it from March 2019

 Google recently completely redesigned the Gmail web
 ab jimail web main wo tamaam fitures milte hai jo company pehle sirf inbox ap main detii thi

 dollar main majbootee or america central bank fedral rigerv ke byaaj daren badhaane ke baad ai giravat se maujuuda samay main gharelu bazaar main sona 10 maheene ke nichle str 27,185 rupye prati das gram par kaarobaar kar rahaa he
 However in the country where during 2016, the major index of the stock market, the SENSEX, scored 0
 5 fisadi kaa ritern diya vahiin is dauraan sone kii keemat main 7 fisadi oochaal darj hui he
 This boom was seen during the early 6 months of 2016 when investment in gold was considered safe by global cues
 lekin 2016 khatm hote-hote sone kii keemat main nivesh demand ghatane se giravat dekhne ko mil rahi he
 The continued decline in gold may continue in 2017
 in 4 kaarnon se sone main dekhi ja sakati he giravat -1
 Gold is not the first choice of the investor: Gold was always called forever in terms of investment
 yani isamen padaa aapkaa paisa sirf badhata he or nivesh kaa sabase surakshit vikalp he
 However, the direct impact of the reshuffle in the global economy is visible on the price of gold
 2016 ke shuruaati maheenon main sone kii keemton main acha ijapha dekhne ko mil rahaa tha jisase mana ja rahaa thi ki puraa saal sone ke liye behatar sabit hoga
 However, following the clear signs of strength in the US economy, investors around the world are now investing in US bonds and stock markets instead of gold
 iske chalate antarrashtriya bazaar main sone main nivesh kii demand lagaataar gir rahi he

 Apart from this, the price of gold in the country varies according to the international market
 2016 khatm hote-hote antarrashtriya market main sone kii keemton main lagaataar jari giravat kaa asar bhartiya bazaar par bhi padaa he
 At the same time, people are shying away from investing in gold in the country due to the threat of benami property in the country and big campaign against black money
 lihaaja, mana ja rahaa he ki america main majboot hoti arthvyavastha 2017 main sone kii keemton ko niche rakhegi
 At the same time, the demand of investors in India will also remain weak due to the new campaign in the country after demonetisation
 aise main 2017 main sone kii keemton main giravat jari rahane kii ummid he

 vahiin 2016 main donald trump ke chunaav jeetne ke baad se dollar ne lagaataar ijapha karte hue 14 saal ke ucchtam str par apni majboot jagah bana lee he
 Its direct impact is on the price of gold
 jaise-jaise dollar main majbootee aegi, sone kii keemton main giravat darj hoti rahegi
 Significantly, the US Central Bank Federal Reserve recently raised interest rates
 vahiin jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki 2017 ke dauraan fedral rigerv kam se kam teen baar or byaaj daron main ijapha kar saktaa he
 This decision will increase investment in banking instruments instead of gold in the US and the popularity of gold will continue to decrease

 New rule of hallmarking will be applicable from January 1: The new law of jewelery hallmarking will come into force from January 1
 nae kanoon ke mutabik desh main 1 janvari se sirf 22, 18 or 14 carat sone kii jewelery kii holmarking kii ja sakegi
 Till now a total of 10 categories of gold are hallmarked in the Indian market
 vahiin 1 janvari le lagu hone vaale ne kanoon se desh main sone ke sikke, biscuit or eent kii bhi holmarking shuru kar di jaaegi
 This move of the government will directly affect the jewelery business in the country
 holmarking kanoon ke baad desh main badi maatra main sona khareednaa or sone main nivesh karne kii prakriya main badi paardarshita dekhne ko milegi
 Due to this transparency, people will avoid investing blackmoney in hallmarking jewelery and gold

 a day after Modi's statement created a political stir, Digvijay Singh said on Twitter, should we not be a nationalist Indian instead of being a Hindu nationalist or Muslim nationalist or Sikh nationalist or Christian nationalist? unhone ek anya twit main sangh parivaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, is mahaan raashtra ko saavarkar or jinna kii tarah dharm ke aadhaar par na baanten

 She has become a symbol of global literacy

 Let us all resolve to fight for what she has stood for
 ishwar use lambii aayu or takat de
 The comments digvijay ne aise samay par twit kiya he, jab modi ne gujarat main 2002 main hue dangon par kaabo paane ke liye koi kadam na uthaane ke aaropon ke khilaaf khud kaa bachaav karne kii koshish kii thi
 Modi said in an interview, "if i am sitting in the back seat of a car and a little puppy falls under the wheels of the car, isn't it sad?" Surely it will be sad
 main bhale hi mukhyamantri hum yaa nahin hum, main ek insaan hum
 If something bad happens, i will be sad
 modi ne kaha ki unhone 2002 ke dangon ke dauraan bilkul sahi kadam uthaae or unki sarkaar ne halaat thik karne ke liye apni puri takat kaa istemaal kiya
 Modi had said, i am a nationalist
 main deshbhakt hum
 There is nothing wrong in this

 Dr
 Chandrasekhar Yadav, professor and well-known knee transplant specialist in the Orthopedics Department at AIIMS, has been listed in the Limca Book of Records
 do saal pehle unhone 3 din ke bheetar 9 ghutane or qamar kaa pratyaropan 11 hazaar feet kii oonchai par karke surgery ke aitihaasik shikhar par apana naam darj kara liya
 But i have mentioned his difficult work in very easy words
 is anokhe record kaa main bhi gavaah rahaa hum
 i have seen Dr
 Chandrasekhar working for more than 12 hours, doctors do not have eletism at all, are known to perform the operation in an obsessive and professional manner
 mujhe yaad he ki 6 may 2013 kii wo taarikh, jab main apane cameraman sudhish ke saath ames ke baahar subah kareeb saadhe chaar baje pahunchaa
 a team of about a dozen doctors were going to leh-ladakh to treat patients from far and wide
 unheen doctoron main ek dow chandrashekhar yadav bhi the
 He had surgery equipment worth over 500 kg
 maine tajjub se doctor yadav se poocha, kya aap vahaan oparation bhi karenge
 Doctor Yadav said excitedly, why not if everything is good, i will do at least half a dozen surgeries
 taaki hamaari upasthiti se jaruratmandon ko zyada se zyada phayda pahunch sake
 We had a flight at six o'clock, we reached Leh around seven and a half
 leh main lamas lobajang ne is swasthya shivi kaa itnaa prachaar kiya tha ki hotel pahunchane ke saath hi marijon kii khaasi badi taadaat yahaan doctoron se apana ilaaj karaane pahunch chuki thi
 We reached the district hospital with doctors
 lekin, yahaan chusul yani kargil ke gaanv se do din kaa safar tay karke pahunche tenzing jaise kai marij hamen mili, jo flite se dilli aakar ghutanon kaa oparation nahin kara sakate the
 Seeing such poor patients, i realized that the poor patients in our country are in dire need of such doctors, but are our doctors ready
 agar dow yadav jaise doctor taiyaar bhi hai to kya lamas lobajang jaise sthaneey prabhaavshaalee log hai jo kam se kam in doctoron ke rahane or khaane kii saaf suthri vyavastha kara sake
 Well, from the first day, the team of doctors came with me to see the patients
 surgery ke saare saamaan jute dow sies yadav ne leh ke jila aspataal ke oparation theatre kaa jayja liya
 The operation theater was equipped with basic needs but a major problem facing Dr
 Yadav was the lack of trend nurses like AIIMS and junior doctors who could understand their essential needs while performing the operation
 pehle din doctor yadav do oparation kar paae kyonki vakt kii kami ke saath nurson or local doctoron kii lay unke saath nahin ban paa rahi thi
 i finished dinner the first day kii teble par dow chandrashekhar se poocha ki sar hai altitude sickness kaa aap zikr kar rahe the
 But i have not felt it till now
 wo muskuraae bole kal subah milanaa phir bataaungaa iske asar ke bare main
 i walked into my room with my cameraman
 lekin aadhi raat main hai altitude sickness ne asar dikhaaya or hamen ulti, chakkar jaisi shikaayatein honi lagi
 Our health deteriorated and then realized why people fall short of oxygen after coming to Leh
 isi sickness ke shikaar dow yadav ke saath aae kuch log hue jiske chalate ek baar laga ki duusare din surgery nahin ho paaegi
 But Dr
 Yadav's stubbornness and his comrades were encouraged to have successful surgery one after the other
 shaam ko kaam khatm karne ke baad jab dow sies yadav mujhase bolte ki raveesh is duniya main sabase badi khushi mujhe tab hoti he jab mere kaam se duusare ke chehre par khushi ke bhav aate hai
 Dr
 CS Yadav himself fell ill on the fourth day after undergoing surgery for three days
 iske thik do saal baad dow chandrashekhar kaa ek din phone aayaa wo bade khush the or unhone bataaya ki leh main jo oparation kiya tha wo shaayad sabase oonchai par kii gai sabase zyada surgery thi, jiske chalate use limca book aaf record main shaamil kiya gaya he
 i felt that the historical service of a dedicated doctor must be told to that generation for which money and fame are becoming the goods of the market
