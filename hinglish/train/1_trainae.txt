 mlas of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party created a ruckus in the Delhi Assembly on the 10th day of the budget session
 sadan main spikar, mantriyon or vidhayakon ne alji anil baijal ke khilaaf kaali pattee baandhakar virodh kiya
 They allege that on the instigation of LG, many questions are not being answered by the authorities
 dillividhansabha main kaarywahi shuru hote hi aap party ke vidhayakon ne sawaal uthaaya kicendre sarkaradwara dilli vidhansabha kii shaktiyon par lagaataar hamalaa ho rahaa he
 The legislators asked whether the elected legislators and the government could not even question corruption, what action was taken, they could not even ask? The mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party protested in the house one by one
 'aap' vidhayak sahiram ne kaha ki afasaron kii selary bhi rigerv kar deni chahie, alji samaj len ki koi ham par eent phenkega to jawaab pathar se milegaa
 MLA Special Ravi said that today we have black-banded the lg's dictatorial attitude in the House and the House should be kept silent for 2 minutes so that the LG gets goodwill
 haalanki spikar ne is masale par maun rakhane kii vidhayak kii maang ko nakaar diya
 'AAP' MLA Somnath Bharti said during this time that LG has killed democracy
 spikar ne bhi baandhi kaali patteehangaame ke bichaspikarne bhi alji par jamkar hamalaa kiya
 The speaker pacified the uproar in the house and said that 17 out of 40 questions were not answered by the authorities today
 angrejon kaa shashan khatm hone ke baad aaj tak kisi sarkaar main aisa nahin hua
 They also want to tie black bandage
 alji ne unhen patr likhaa he ki vidhansabha adhyaksh arakshit maamalon se jude kisi bhi prashn ko sweekaar nahin karenge
 After his statement, the speaker also tied a black band and protested
 aapako bataa den ki jameen, services or kanoon se jude tamaam maamle alji ke adhikaar kshetra main aate hai
 The tussle between the Aam Aadmi Party government and the LG office over rights has now become extremely common
 haal hi main vidhansabha satr ke dauraan spikar ne prashnon ke jawaab nahin milane par aapatti bhi jataai thi
 BJP supported black bandage, however, during this time BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa supported AAP mlas to tie black bandage but also protested against the black bandage of the speaker
 sirsa ne sadan main kaha ki vipaksh kaali pattee baandhne kaa samarthan karti he
 The government of Delhi is elected, it is not a nominated government
 haalanki spikar ko kaali pattee nahi baandhani chahie
 This would be contrary to the traditions of the Constitution
 kanoon kaa paalan karnaa spikar kaa dharm he
 If the officers are not answering, then ask for an answer from RTI
 duusari ore, vidhansabha main yah kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki agle somvaar or mangalvaar yani 2 se 3 april tak satr ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 During these 10 days, from mlas to speakers, the LG has been fiercely attacked

 aam chunaav se thik pehle bihar main siem nitish kumaar dwaara kii gai sharaab bandi ek baar phir charchaaon main he
 Actually, the reason for the discussion this time is the Bihar Police personnel themselves
 bihar ke nalanda se ek aisi tasviir saamne ai he jisamen bihar police ke jawan nashe kii haalat main hangaamaa karte dikh rahe hai
 The special thing is that Nalanda is the home district of CM Nitish Kumar

 jahaan karyrat do saf ke javaanon ne sharaab ke nashe main khub hangaamaa kiya
 After getting the information of the incident, when the police detained both the jawans, both the accused jawans started attacking the police too
 magar police ne kisi tarah se donon javaanon ko kaabo main liya
 But even after this, their commotion did not stop
 philhal donon ko police hiraasat main lekar medical jaanch ke liye bhej diya gaya he
 But it is evident from this incident that the government has not been successful in getting the complete liquor ban in Bihar
 gauratlab he ki nitish kumaar ne sharaab bandi kanoon ko sahi tareeke se lagu karne ko lekar kuch din pehle ek aankada pesh kiya tha
 According to this data released by the Bihar government, in Bihar, one accused is being arrested every 10 minutes for not following the liquor ban law
 yani kii bihar police har din 172 aise logon ko giraftaar kar rahi he jo is kanoon kaa ullaghann karte hai

 Malegaon blast accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has been fielded by BJP from Bhopal seat
 is elaan ke baad se hi sadhvi pragna ko chunaav ladane se rokane kii kavayad shuru ho gai he
 After the social activist Tehseen Poonawala, now the father of the Malegaon blast victim has filed a petition in the NIA court of Maharashtra and questioned the bail of Sadhvi
 enie court main daayar kii gai yachika main kaha gaya he ki sadhvi pragna ko court ne swasthya kaarnon ke chalate jamaanat di thi, to aise main vah bhopal se loksabhaa kaa chunaav kaise lard sakati hai
 The victim's father demanded that the court should stop Sadhvi Pragya from contesting the 2019 elections and also order her to appear before the court during the hearing (sadhvi Pragya) as per the High Court order
 peedit ke pita ne kaha ki pragna thakur ko jamaanat is shart par di gai thi ki vah sunwaayee main hissaa lengi, lekin vah apane aapako aswasth or stan cancer se peedit bataakar sunwaayee main hissaa nahin le rahi hai
 While Sadhvi is taking part in various programs and giving objectionable speeches

 In the complaint, Tehsin Poonawala has demanded that Pragya be stopped from contesting the election
 haalanki, chunaav ayog ne poonawala kii shikaayat ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The Election Commission had said that Sadhvi Pragya Thakur is not guilty in any case
 unpar koi bhi dosha sabit nahin hua he
 Sadhvi had said, "I did not get bail on health grounds
 On Thursday, in conversation with Aaj Tak, Sadhvi Pragya had said on the rhetoric about her bail," Her information is wrong
 mujhe lagata he unhone yah kyon nahin kaha ki mujhe tatkaal faansee par lataka dena chahie
 This was their conspiracy
 mujhe swasthya ke aadhaar par bel nahin mili he
 'sadhvi Pragya had said on the terrorism charges,' the allegations have also been levied on her

 It is learned that all the members of the executive unanimously asked the BCCI President n Srinivasan to address the ongoing problems with the Hyderabad-based franchise
 kaaryakarini ke ek anya sadsy ne kaha, ‘kuch sadasyon ne suzav diya ki board sambhavit khariddaar ke liye samachar patron main vigyaapan de saktaa he taaki ve boli laga saken
 These bids will not be opened until September 15 as the franchise has been given the same time limit to clear its financial liability

 is saal ganatantr diwas parade kii theme ko ham 'shakti or soundarya kaa milan' kah sakate hai
 By the way, in the official language it is being called 'women's Empowerment'
 darasal 26 janvari ko nai dilli ke rajpath par parade kaa mukhya aakarshan bhale hi america raashtrapati baraak obama honge, lekin is dauraan sena kii mahila shakti bhi logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karegi
 For the first time in this Republic Day parade, separate contingents of women will also be seen along with the traditional male parties of the Army, Air Force and Navy
 aamtaur par parade kii ek tukdi main 148 pratibhaagi yaa sadsy hote hai
 In this context, 148-148 women officers of the three armies will participate in the parade
 aisa itihaas main pehali baar hone ja rahaa he
 It is being said that all this is being done on the suggestion of the Prime Minister's Office, so that people know that the participation of women in the army is increasing
 lekin siarpief, itibipi or biguef jaise ardhsainik balon main mahilaon kii tukdi hone ke baavjood unhen 26 janvari ke parade main apni tukdi ko kaman karne kaa mauka nahin diya ja rahaa
 However, officers of the three armies are finding it difficult to find 148 women for the parade
 vajah he mahilaon kii kam sankhya
 And the second thing is that just being a woman is not enough for the parade
 sabhi kii kad lathi ek jaisi honi chahie or ek jaisaa kadam taal bhi
 There are a total of 1
3 million soldiers in the Indian Army, of which about 37,000 are male officers, while the total number of female officers is only 1300
 yani sena main prati 28 purush adhikariyon kii tulana main ek mahila adhikari he
 Similarly, the number of women in the Air Force is 1334, which is 1: 8 (the number of male officers is about 11 thousand)
 yani aath purush adhikariyon kii tulana main ek mahila adhikari
 If we talk about the Navy, the number of women is only 337 while the total number of Indian Navy is 60 thousand (about 8 thousand officers)
 yani kareeb 24 purush adhikariyon kii tulana main ek mahila adhikari he
 It was only after the formation of the Modi government that it was decided that now women in the army would be given permanent commission
 lekin yah mauka un mahilaon ko hi milegaa, jo 2015 se sena main kamishan hogi
 Although women have been involved in the army since 1991, but there has always been a reluctance in the army about women
 saal 1991 se sena main mahila adhikari hai, lekin haalat yah he abhi tak unke liye alag uniform tak nahin ban paae he
 Whether it is pocket or zip
 sena main captain rahi sumisha shankar kahati hai, hamen purushon kii tarah dikhaane kii kya jarurat he? america jaise deshon main sena main mahila adhikariyon kaa dress unke suvidha ke mutabik hota he
 Significantly, after the court's decision in 2008, women were given permanent commission in the first Navy and Air Force, but the army with great difficulty gave permanent commission to women
 philhal, mahilaon ko sthai kamishan legal, intelligence, supplai kor main hi diya gaya he
 Now about 2031 women will be given permanent commission in branches like Aviation, Signal
 gauratlab he ki desh kii sena main mahila keval afasar hi ban sakati hai
 Women are not recruited in the army at the level of jawans
 vahiin ardhsainik balon main mahila javaanon kii bhartee bhi hoti he
 Even women in the Border Security Force have been deployed in the security of Indian posts on the international border and are also patrolling along the border
 siarpief main to mahilaon ko naksal virdohi abhiyaan main tainaat kiya gaya he
 At the same time, women officers claim that women officers have performed better in competitions on all occasions within the army
 sena main unke behatar pradarshan ko darkinar karte hue sena ne kabhi mahila adhikariyon ko tavajjo nahin di or ab jab sena kaman dene ko taiyaar hui he, tab vah bhi court ke dakhal ke baad sambhav ho paaya he
 At the same time, all these women officers are in the supporting role in the Indian Army, but there is no question of combat role
 iskaa sidhaa matlab yah hi koi mahila adhikari ladaai ke maidan main nahin ja sakati he
 At the same time, women in the Navy cannot go on a warship, nor can women fight in the Air Force
 udhar, pakistan jaise kattar maane jane vaale mulk main aaj mahila ladaaku vimaan uda rahi hai or haal main pakistan kii vayusena kii flite leftinent aesha faruk ne duniya main pehali mahila fiter payalat kaa gaurav hasil kiya, jisane kisi ilaake main bam giraaya he
 a senior army officer told that the situation is different in India
 mahilaon ko achaanak sena main upar nahin le jaaya ja saktaa
 For him, you will have to create an atmosphere with training, then it can become a matter
 ' On this, a woman officer posted in the Air Force said that do not pretend to show women empowerment only by parading, women who are in the army are not being given preference in promotion nor any decisive role despite their ability

 He said, i want to make it clear that i will not play international cricket as long as there is an existing board
 jab ye adhikari chale jaaenge or agar log chahenge ki main khelun to main vaapasi par vichaar kar saktaa hum
 Afridi, however, said that he would continue to play domestic and league matches
 unhone kaha, main gharelu or lig cricket khelnaa jari rakhuunga lekin antarrashtriya cricket nahin
 i have no such appreciation in this board, who tried to hear neither my reason nor my favor to sack me as a captain
 unhone kaha, main is tarah ke nimnastareey logon ke saath kaam karnaa nahin chahta

 is alrounder ne westeindies se lautne ke baad us samay board ko naaraaz kar diya tha jab unhone media se kaha ki unhen apane kaam main logon kaa hastkshep pasand nahin he
 His likely gesture was against differences with head coach Waqar Younis on selection issues

 bharat ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone ke silsile main pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii yatra jis dhang se lee, usase sharif zyada khush nahin hai
 a senior member of Pakistan's ruling PML-N told Dawn News that Sharif felt inferior when he did not have a joint press conference after a mutual meeting of the two prime ministers
 akhbaar ke mutabik, uske alaava sharif kaa pratinidhimandal ek sanyukt bayaan kii ummid kar rahaa tha, lekin aisa koi bayaan jari nahin hua, ulte, bharat ne ekatarfa bayaan jari kar diya, jisamen pakistan kaa rukh shaamil nahin tha
 His party colleague told the newspaper, Sharif is not very happy with the way he met in India during his visit to attend Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony
 is piemail-en sadsy ne kathith rup se kaha ki bharat ke bayaan main sharif ko lekar sarsari taur par ullekh tha or unki upasthiti ke mahatv ko upyukt rup se sweekaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 He claimed that India's dry and unsuited press release compelled him to hold his press conference where he read a carefully prepared statement so that what was gained from the visit did not go in vain
 is piemail-en sadsy ne kaha ki pakistan sarkaar ab donon deshon ke bich sachiv str kii vaarta se bharat ke saath sambandh sudhaarney main kuch uplabdhi milane kii aas lagaai hui he
 This was agreed upon during Sharif's visit to India

 S
 and chief data scientist of Graminar, a data science company based in Hyderabad and Bangalore
 anand kehete hai, "chunaav ayog kaa data, matadaata suchiyaan, sidhi-saadi telephone diarectory or bahut-si sarkari or nijee agenciyon ke tamaam survey siyaasi partiyon ke liye big data ke kuch strot hai
 The usefulness of these data depends on how well they are analyzed
 '' bhartiya doorsanchaar kii awwal shakhsiyat sam pitroda bhi, jo congress ke oversij mahakme ke mukhiya hai, siyaasi muhimon main big data analysis kii ahmiyat sweekaar karte hai
 He says, "data analysis gives us a good understanding of many features such as age, group, caste, religion, place, education, profession and relationships
 ''agar tamaam pakshon ke bich is baat par takreeban sarvasakvamati he ki hindustan ke siyaasi sandarbh main soshal media ke data ko khangaalane or uskaa vishleshan karne kaa asar or gunjaaish bahut simit he
 Anand dismisses the power of social media data to influence elections, saying that the user profiles of platforms like Facebook do not necessarily provide information like caste and political leanings that are very important for India's elections
 ve kehete hai, "2014 main soshal media kii paith aaj ke mukaable kahin kam thi
 To say that Facebook data will help in creating a successful election campaign is currently a 10-year leap of faith
 ''"ve aar soshal and hootsoot'' kii 2018 kii global digital report ke mutabik, duniya bhar ke 53 fisadi ke ausat ke mukaable hindustan main internet kii paith 34 fisadi he
 Internet penetration in the US is 99 percent
 soshal media kii paith ke maamle main bhi hindustan vaishvik ausat se bahut peeche he
 In January 2018, 19% of social media penetration was recorded in India, while its global average is 42%
 alabatta 31 fisadi ke saath yah soshal media kii paith ke maamle main doosraa sabase teji se badhata desh tha
 The data also suggests that there would have been little chance that the CA would have had enough data to influence the elections in India through social media tactics
 hindustan main internet kii paith main mobile phone data se ubhaar aayaa, jise jabardast raftaar 2016 main hi jeeyo phone ke launch ke saath mili jab data shulk main tej giravat ai
 In India, 79 percent of web traffic comes from mobile as compared to the global average of 52 percent
 bhaajapa or congress, donon ke saath kaam kar chuke ek pramukh chunaav ranneetikaar anand kii baat se ittefaq rakhte hai or kehete hai ki soshal media par america or hindustani logon ke bartaav main bahut fark he
 He says, "it is easier for an analyst in America to guess whether a person is a Republican or a Democrat
" hindustan main log apane siyaasi jhukaav or bartaav ke bare main zyada kuch ujagar nahin karte
 Praveen Chakraborty, who heads the data analytics wing of the Congress, admits that social media makes it easier for anyone to deliver their message in a targeted manner, but it cannot anticipate the voter's behavior in advance
 ve kehete hai, "fasebuk ke rujhaanon se matadaata ke bartaav ke bare main jaanane or bataane ko hindustan ke sandarbh main bahut bad-chadhakar aanka or bataaya ja rahaa he
 Contrary to his claim, a 2013 study published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences proved that if one had enough data, one could be quite accurate about sensitive personal qualities, including political views based on mere "likes" Can be guessed
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne haal hi main jab bhaajapa saansadon se kaha ki agar ve 2019 kaa chunaav laduya chaahate hon to unhen fasebuk pej par "jenuin likes'' ko 3,00,000 tak badhanaa chahie, tab iske peeche shaayad yahi tark rahaa ho
 But Chakraborty flatly rejected ca's claim that he had helped political parties to win elections with his data analysis
 ve kehete hai, "data or unka vishleshan chunavi ranneeti main upyogi input ho sakate hai
 But to say that data analytics alone will win the elections is a matter of exaggeration
 yah chunaav main lagane vaale kai ahm inupat main se ek he
 According to Pitroda, messaging based on data analysis has a short-term impact
 ve kehete hai, " ''—"siyasat koi utpaada bechnaa nahin he
 This is the new thing that has been promoted by businessmen to make money
 yah zyada din chalegaa nahin
 Mahatma Gandhi did not need such tools to deliver his point
 agar sandesh sachcha he to yah un logon tak pahunch hi jayega jin tak ise pahunchaaya janaa he
 "an election strategist, on the condition of anonymity, indicated that there are complexities in the analysis of data, as Facebook provides dynamic data
" ve kehete hai, "har roj arabon data point paidaa kiye jaaenge
 To understand what this means, a very high level of analysis is required, which can be really time consuming

 By the way, Nawaz Sharif does not confess in public forums that the crop of terrorism is blooming here and the terrorists who came from his land have done such incidents as Mumbai and Pathankot
 wo is bare main jhooth bolte bhi nahin thakte ki unhen bharat in hamalon main pakistani aatankiyon ke shaamil hone ke saboot nahin detaa he
 But whether it is a Mumbai attack or Pathankot or a day-long attack in Jammu and Kashmir, in every such incident, there is evidence of terrorists who came from the soil of Pakistan

 Recently millions of computers from hundreds of countries came under the grip of this ransomware
 inamen sabase zyada windos computers the
 It was allegedly a tool developed by the NSA that hackers are using to make money by stealing it
 wannacry rancemaware kaa khatra tala nahin he ki ab ek aisa hi nayamalaware aa chukaa he
 Its name is being described as eternalrocks
 khaas baat yah he ki yah rancemaware bhi kathith taur par america neshnal security agency dwaara hi develop kiya gaya he
 eternalrocks is also dangerous because researchers believe it uses the nsa's seven hacking tools to spread from one computer to another
 inamen eternalblue, eternalchampion, Eternalsynergy, Doublepulsar, Architouch or smbtouch shaamil hai
 Significantly, in April, the hacker tool of the NSA was allegedly leaked by a hacker group called Shadow Breaker
 iske baad group ne yah dhamkee bhi di ki agle kuch maheene main data damp kar diya jayega
 How this malware works is slightly different from how this ransomware works
 kyonki yah pehle stage main yah system ko infect karata he or tor network downlod karata he
 The second stage of the attack begins after 24 hours when the command and control server responds
 der se atake karnaa ek trick he, taaki system ke liye ise detect kar paanaa mushkil ho
 Some cyber security experts believe that this malware named Internal Rocks is even more dangerous than wannacry because it has no weaknesses
 sabase bhayaavah yah he ki iskaa koi kil switch nahin hota jiske jariye riserchars mailaware par lagaam lagaate hai
 The reason for this is that it starts working 24 hours after getting into the computer so that it cannot be stopped

 He did not get caught stealing, so he took off his coat and hid the bag inside the coat
 phir usne kot ke saath bag uthaaya or farm house se baahar nikal gaya
 The family of the victim said that one and a half lakh rupees were kept in the stolen bag
 gharavaalon ko jab pataa laga to pehle to sabane aasapaas dhundha, phirasisitivi cameradekha gaya to pataa laga ki bag to kot pant pahane shaks ne uda liya he

 mujhe ab bhi lagata he ki 250-280 kaa score sabase zyada he
 Tendulkar had termed the International Cricket Council (ICC) rule of using two balls in odis as the right initiative to spoil this format

 Lee said, 'I don't think the use of one or two balls in odis can cause an issue
 do nai gendon kaa hona vanade formet main gendbaajon ko madad de saktaa he

 donald trump america kaa 45wein president honge
 During the election campaign he spoke fiercely against the Sharnars and Muslims
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki wo america se musalamaanon par pratibandh laga diya jaae
 But now, after winning the election, his attitude is changed
 jeet ke baad die gaye bhaashan main bhi unhone hillari clinton kii jis tareeke se tarif or shukriya adaa kiya he uski surkhiyaan ban rahi hai
 Apart from this he also thanked him who did not vote for him
 dilachasp baat yah he ki ab unkiwebsiti us statementco hataa liya gaya he jisamen unhone kaha tha ki wo america se sthai taur par musalamaanon ko bain kar diya jaae
 According to the report of the British newspaper, The Independent, a new link has been removed by replacing that statement and clicking on it opens the page of donation
 reports ke mutabik elekshak ke din subah se hi wo pej uplabdh nahin tha
 But it started again in the night which had a new link, that is, the statement given against Muslims was removed
 piyu research ke mutabaki donald trump ne 7 disambar 2015 ko apni website par kaha tha, 'america main kisi bhi musalamaanon ko ghusane se tab tak puri tarah bain lagaaya jaae jabatak hamaare desh ke pratinidhi ye na samaj len ki kya ho rahaa he'gauratlab he 2015 paris atake ke baad donald trump ke is vivaadaaspad bhaashan kii ninda duniya bhar main hui thi
 However, there must be some wonder why he has done this
 kyonki aksar aise chunavi statement mahaj ek jumala hote hai
 However, Trump said in the last phase of the campaign that he is talking about not banning all Muslims from America but banning those who are coming from outside and their links are from terrorists

 har daag ko chhudaane kaa apana ek tarika or upaay hota he
 These are some of the remedies that you can try and clean the stubborn stains on your clothes easily: 1
 agar aapke kapade par paan kaa daag lag gaya he to kapade ko khatti dahi yaa phir matthey main bhigokar rakh dijie
 After some time rubbed the stained area with light hands
 es karne se daag halke pad jaaenge or ek-do baar isi prakriya ko karne se kapade par laga daag puri tarah saaf ho jayega
 2
 icecream ke daag ko ammonia ke istemaal se saaf kiya ja saktaa he
 3
 periods ke dauraan agar kapade gande ho jaaen yaa phir kisi tarah kii chot kii vajah se kapade par khun kaa daag lag jaae to use namak ragadkar saaf kiya ja saktaa he
 4
 paint yaa greece kedag ko saaf karne ke liye mitti ke tel kaa istemaal karnaa kargar hota he
 After cleaning with kerosene, clean the cloth using hot water with the help of high quality surf
 5
 To remove lipstick stains, soak a cotton wool in the spirit and rub it on the affected area
 uske baad use garm pani main surf daalkar dho len
 If you do this two to three times, the stain will be lightened

 congress adhyaksh rahul ke kaman sanbhaalane ke baad congress party main faisle lene kii sabase badi body kaarysmiti kaa gathan ab tak nahin ho sakaa he
 Rahul Gandhi was given the right to choose the working committee at the Congress General Assembly at Talkatora Stadium
 isse pehle seetaram kesari ke kaarykaal main aakhri baar kaarysmiti kaa chunaav hua tha
 After this, the Working Committee was never elected during Sonia
 rahul gandhi khud kaarysmiti ke sadasyon ke chunaav ke paksh main maane jate rahe hai
 But due to apprehension of division and disunity among the leaders of the party by holding elections, nomination was preferred rather than election
 beete 18 disambar ko party ne ek sur se congress adhyaksh ko kaarysmiti chunane kaa prastaav paas kiya tha
 But 4 months have come but Rahul Gandhi is yet to announce his working committee
 netaaon ke chunaav main mushkilsutron ke mutabik, rahul gandhi party kii sabase badi body main kaaphi badlaav karnaa chaahate hai
 However, he wants to keep young and senior leaders in sync, but Rahul's choice will be
 aise main kai wo puraane chehre jo sonia kii chuni kaarysmiti main the or rahul kii bhi gudbuk main hai, unako lekar to koi dikkat nahin he
 But such old faces who stayed in Sonia's goodbook, but Rahul does not like, the problem is about them
 congress adhyaksh ek jatke main kaarysmiti kaa gathan karenge, isiliye unke salaahkaaron kii najar karnataka chunaavon par he
 Those close to Rahul feel that there is no consensus on Rahul's Iqbal in the party
 phir sonia gandhi khud bhi bade netaaon ke saamne rahul se badlaav karne ko kah chuki hai
 But Team Rahul wants that, as his stature increased among the party workers after a good performance in the Gujarat elections and he made changes in the party organization, in the same way, after the better performance in Karnataka, if he will form a working committee, it will be more effective
 saath hi team se out netaaon ko kaaryakartaaon kaa samarthan bhi nahin milegaa
 Rahul does not want to impose decisions; Rahul wants that whatever decision he takes, he should get the support of the workers from the heart
 varanaa sonia gandhi kii congress ab rahul kii congress ho chuki he
 In such a situation, who can stop them from taking decisions
 phir bhi team rahul chaahati he ki, jo bhi bada faisla ho wo thopa hua naa lage, jabaki party ke bheetar is deree ko lekar sawaal uthne lage hai
 Most questions were raised about the impeachment, when there were differences on the issue within the party and a decision was taken without a working committee
 is mudde par 'ajtak' se baatcheet karte hue congress netaa arpyen singh ne kaha ki, rahul ji ke faislon par puri party ko yakeen he, wo soch samajhakar sahi vaqt par sahi faisla lenge
 He has come to the party only after taking advice from everyone and taking everyone along

 " 2ji spectrum aavanton ghotaalaa bhale hi tihaad jail main band e raja ke ird gird gum rahaa ho lekin lok lekha samiti ke kuch sadasyon kii maang ke baavjood iske adhyaksh murali manohar joshi ne purv doorsanchaar mantri ko piesi ke samaksh talab kiye jane se inkaar kar diya he
 Joshi has argued that being jailed, he will have to go through a lengthy process to be summoned
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava raja kaa bayaan nahin liye jane ke baavjood samiti ke paas anya gavaahon ke itane bayaan or anya sakshya maujuud hai ki unke hi aadhaar par piesi kisi nattejey par panhuch sakati he
 On the demand of some of its Congress and DMK members to summon Raja and other witnesses before the PAC, Joshi said in a letter to his committee colleagues that the matter of summoning the former telecom minister was in the last days of the term of the committee Has been raised and is no longer possible
 unhone kaha ki maujuuda saakshyon or gavaahon ke bayanon ke aadhaar par hi samiti kisi nattejey tak panhuchane main sakasham he
 Joshi said in his letter, since Raja is in judicial custody, it will take time to call him before the committee
 vartmaan piesi kaa kaarykaal 30 april ko samaapt ho rahaa he
 In the pac's 'internal meeting' held on 21 April, some members insisted that Raja, the 'main hero of the drama', should also be called before the committee
 is sawaal par ki 2ji spectrum aavanton kii jaanch ke liye jepisi kaa gathan ho jane ke baad kya piesi ko is maamle kii jaanch jari rakhni chahie, joshi ne kaha ki loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar pehle hi vyavastha de chuki hai ki jepisi ke gathan ke baad bhi piesi kii bhoomika ko kamatar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 He also said that the rules do not allow extension of tenure of the current PAC
 sutron ne bataaya ki 2ji spactrum report ko apnaane ke sambandh main charchaa ke liye 28 april ko 22 sadasyeey piesi kii baithak bulaai gai he
 According to sources, Joshi is insisting on adopting the report
 agar sarvasammati yaa bahumat ke faisle se bhi report apana lee jaati he to adhyaksh ke taur par joshi ko sansad kaa satr nahin chalane kii sthiti main bhi ise loksabhaa adhyaksh ko saunpane kaa adhikaar hoga
 This can be done by April 30 before the term of the committee ends
 pichhali do baithkon main piesi is mudde par banty najar ai ki kya jepisi ke gathan ke baad ise 2ji spectrum ghotaale kii jaanch kerani chahie
 Apart from this, his argument is that the CBI is also investigating it under the supervision of the Supreme Court

 dollar ke darmiyaan singh or rajendra singh iske liye gaanv ke thik upar se bani sadakon ke nirmaan ko doshi maanate hai, ''narendranagar se rani-pokhari ke liye motor sadak banaate samay hamaare virodh ke baavjood chattan kaatane ke liye zyada takat vaale dynamite kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 This caused the cracks within the hill far along the road to move
 '' is haadase ke baad tehri ke jila adhikari ne is ilaake ke bhu-garbheey savekshan ke liye adhikariyon ko nirdesh die hai
 The real scientific reasons will be revealed only after this survey, but denying this innate discretion of the villagers means to prepare the role of the next disaster for another village

 Piyush Rautela also considers construction activities as the main reason behind the accident
 ve kehete hai ki dollar kii aabaadi ke upar old land slide jone tha, jis par sadak banane ke liye dynamite ke prayog ne bhuskhalan ko phir se sakriy kar diya
 According to him the damage caused by such activities can be seen in the Shivalik range from Narendranagar to Nainital

 The village of Gangadhar Nautiyal, president of the Rudraprayag District Bar Association, en route to the Kedarnath temple, was damaged last year due to a tunnel built under the village for the fata-viewangarh hydropower project
 nautial kehete hai, ''pichley saal sirsi gaanv ke 66 pariwaron ke 110 makaan or gaushalaayein visphot ke kaaran kshatigast ho gai thim
 Construction work on the project is still going on despite protests, due to which land has been torn off at several places in Sirsi village this year
 ''chipko andolan ke pramukh netaa evam paryaavaran kaaryakarta chandiprasad bhatta bhuskhalan ke liye prakruti se zyada maanviya gatividhiyon ko jimmedaar maanate hai
 He says, "the way we are looking for an excuse to be relieved of our responsibility by giving the status of an accident caused by a cloudburst to the loss of life and property caused by every landslide, it will increase the intensity of these disasters in future Gonna be iske liye hamen nirmaan kaaryon kii paramparaagat takneekee ko chhodkar pahaado va samvedansheel ilaakon ke liye jaruri prakrutisammat nirmaan gatividhiyon kii khoj kerani hogi or unhen sanchalit karne kaa rasta dhundhna hoga

 Two weeks after the Indian Army's surgical strike in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, India feels that there is now a strong possibility that a terrorist attack will take place as a retaliation from Pakistan
 yah baat sheershasth sutron ne NDTV se kahi
 India crossed the Line of Control two weeks ago, destroying five launch pads of terrorists and two bases of the Pakistan Army in pok
 adhikari ne kaha ki aise kisi hamale par bharat kii javaabi karrwai is baat par nirbhar karegi ki hamalaa kis tarah kaa hoga, lekin usamen 'gati, chaunkaane kii kshamta tathaa praveenta' zarur hogi
 Sources said that the possibility of an attack in Jammu and Kashmir cannot be ruled out
 sutara ne bataaya, "hamaara akalan kahata he ki kashmir ghati main is vakt 250 aatankwaadi sakriy hai
 
 
 While the infiltration is in full swing, local people are also being recruited
 
 
 " Indian security agencies believe that the atmosphere of constant tension in the valley and the presence of terrorists there has made it easier for Pakistan-based terrorists to attack
 bharat kaa maananaa he ki bharat kii pakistan ko lekar niti main sargical strike kii vajah se 'anpredactibility' (jiskaa purvanumaan lagaana sambhav nahin ho) kaa tatv paidaa ho gaya he
 The official said that because of this it has become 'much more difficult' for Pakistan to decide the 'answer' to the surgical strike, and furthermore 'global opinion is also in India's favor
 
 
 'tippaniyan After the surgical strike, India had also explicitly told Pakistan that it did not want to disturb the situation, but any threat or attack would be answered appropriately
 adhikari ne kaha, "ham ek baat par bilkul spasht hai ki aatankwaad kii vajah se bharat ko nuksaan nahin pahunchane diya jayega
 
 
 India will ensure its national security
 
 
 " The official said that India's response to such an attack would depend on what the attack would be like, but would certainly have 'speed, astounding ability and proficiency'
 sutron ne bataaya ki jammu evam kashmir main hamale kii ashanka se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The source said, "our assessment says that 250 militants are active in the Kashmir Valley at the moment

 India believes that the surgical strike in India's policy on Pakistan has created an element of 'unpredictability' (which is not possible to predict)
 adhikari ne kaha ki isaki vajah se pakistan ke liye sargical strike kaa 'jawaab' tay karnaa 'kahin zyaada mushkil' ho gaya he, or iske alaava 'vaishvik raay bhi bharat ke paksh main hi he

 According to the information, he went to monastery to rest at 9 pm, about an hour before the bomb was found

 But now two live bombs have once again raised questions on security
 aaj se thik ek saal pehle colors tivi ke mashhoor dharawahik 'balika vadhoo' main 'anandi' kaa kirdaar nibhaakar shoharat hasil karne vaali pratyusha banerjee ne achaanak khudakushi kar lee thi
 She was found hanging on the noose in her house
 pratyusha kii maut ke baad ek hi sawaal sabake saamne tha ki aakhir is kaamyaab abhinetri ne jaan kyon di
 The fame of Anandi's character is that every actress who steps into the world of small screen wants people to recognize her by her work and name
 use wo bulandiyaan hasil hon ki log har taraf uski charchaa karen
 Something similar had happened with Pratyusha, 24 years old
 jab use 'balika vadhoo' ke lokapriy kirdaar 'anandi' ke liye chunaa gaya to pratyusha ko bhi andaja nahin tha ki darshak use itnaa pansad karenge
 The character of 'anandi', meeting Rahul, brought Pratyusha to new heights of fame
 bas vahiin uski duniya badal gai
 Along with the success, he also got a lot of fans
 jo uski adaaon ke divaane the
 Meanwhile, Pratyusha met Rahul Raj Singh during a function held in Jamshedpur
 rahul ek nirmaataa or abhinayta hai
 Just from there both of them had four eyes and fell in love
 shaadi kaa iraadaa thise dauraan donon kai maukon par saath-saath dekhe jane lage the
 The love of both was climbing day by day
 tivi indresti main bhi donon ke pyaar kii charchaa joro par thi
 There were reports that both are going to get married after some time
 or disambar 2015 main is baat par khud donon ne sahmati bhi jataai thi
 Love escalated into controversy, but suddenly Rahul and Pratyusha's relationship started to crack
 jaankaree ke mutabik donon ke bich khinchataan hone lagi thi
 Meanwhile, there was a fierce argument between Rahul and Pratyusha one day
 or usee ke kuch din baad rahul raaj singh ne apni premika pratyusha par hi dhokhadhadi kaa iljaam laga diya
 The case was related to money transactions
 lihaaja donon ke bich vivaad shuru ho gaya tha
 Pratyusha had changed since then, a big storm came in Pratyusha's life
 uski pareshaaniyaan badhati ja rahi thi
 According to his close friends these days his behavior was also changing
 wo chidchidi hoti ja rahi thi
 During the last January, Pratyusha also accused four policemen of forcibly entering their house and committing abuses
 pehle bwoyfriend makrand se bhi hua tha vivaadarahul se pehle pratyusha kaa apane bwoyfriend makrand malhotra se brallep ho chukaa tha
 The controversy had increased so much that at that time he had lodged a complaint against Makrand at Oshiwara police station in Mumbai
 pratyusha ne makrand par unase or unke pita se galat vyavhaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 It is said that Makarand did not like to go out with his friends
 makrand ek bijnesaman tha
 Later Makarand also lodged a complaint against Pratyusha in the same police station
 donon november 2011 se ek duusare ko date kar rahe the
 In love, he was hurt by deception because of the antitheism, now Rahul has shunned Pratyusha

 And the same thing was being eaten inside Pratyusha

 Anti-government protesters in Thailand have been in Bangkok since 13 January, under which roadways have been closed and protests are being held at major intersections of the city

 Surapong said that it has become imperative for authorities to implement law and order to curb anti-government protests, and to conduct elections in a democratic manner
 pradhanmantri ne chunaav kaa aahvaan kiya he, jabaki mukhya vipakshi party ne chunaav kaa bahishkaar karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The Election Commission is not in the mood to give any direction or order to present the budget to the Central Government
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 324 main die gaye adhikaar ayog ko shaktishaalee to banaate hai, lekin centre sarkaar cabajet ko rokane yaa taalane kaa aadeshdene kaa saaf praavdhaan usamen nahin he
 The constitution experts here are reiterating the tradition, because the Model Code of Conduct considers it to be morally wrong to present the full budget in the assembly elections 
 ab to sarkaar ne bhi yah sanket de die hai ki vah vidhansabha chunaavon ke pehle charan se teen din pahaleam bajatpesh karegi, kyonki samvidhan centre sarkaar ko desh kaa bajet banane kii jimmedaari detaa he, lekin uski taarikh ko lekar koi saaf nirdesh nahin he
 The Election Commission and the President are also aware of this
 vahiin chunaav ayog kii jahaan tak baat he to ayog ne bhi is babat apane kanoon visheshgy panel se mashvira liya he
 After this, the Commission seems to be in the mood that if the need arises, the Central Government will be issued some instructions about the budget, but it will not be stopped from presenting the budget, because even in the Constitution it has been said that the Central Government It is also the right of the Central Government to decide the budget of the country and when to present it in Parliament
 samvidhan visheshgy or loksabhaa ke purv mahasachiv pediti aachaari kaa bhi kahana he ki ayog un binduon or paristhitiyon par apana aadesh yaa nirdesh jari kar saktaa he, jinka zikr samvidhan main nahin he
 But on the things that the Constitution is clear about, the scope of Article 324 is also limited, because under Article 324 of the Constitution, the Election Commission has been given unlimited powers to conduct free and fair elections, but where the Constitution was not noticed Or comes the area of circumstantial dispute, where power is vested in the Election Commission under 324, that is, the Commission can then exercise that right in its discretion
 The literacy
 aachaari kaa ye bhi kahana he ki samvidhan ke mutabik, ayog aam bajet pesh karne kii taarikh tay karne ke maamle main centre sarkaar ko nirdesh nahin de saktaa

 The result of significant changes in the economic and political situation in the country during the last three years of the Modi government is today
 rajyon ke mukhyamantri kamjor ho chuke hai or khud pradhanmantri modi desh ke sabase taqatvar pradhanmantri ban chuke hai
 This is to say the economic data of the country
 beete teen saal ke dauraan desh main jo ahm aarthik faisle liye gaye unase rajyon kii aarthik sthiti na sirf kamjor hui he balki uski keemat par kendra sarkaar adhik majboot ho gai he
 It is clear from these important figures during the last three years that the state governments have become weak and the center has become stronger at the cost of it
 rajkoshiya ghate se bigadaa kendra-rajya kaa balancerajkoshiya ghaataa yani ek saal main sarkarein kitna kharch karti he or kitna kamaati hai

 At the same time, the central government has set a target for the current fiscal year to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3
 2 fisadi par le aae or rajasav ghate ko 1
 Limit it to 9 percent

 Currently, the fiscal deficit of the central government is 3

 It is estimated to reach 2 percent

 Significantly, with the question of the security of the Aadhaar data being questioned, the privacy of the common man is also being questioned
 lekin is puri prakriya se rajya sarkarein achhuti hai
 At the same time, the state government will be completely dependent on the Aadhaar data of the central government to extend the benefits of government schemes to the common man

 There is a rhetoric on who will press the button of the nuclear bomb first

 In the midst of the ongoing war between Iran and the United States for the last four months, Iran has suddenly threatened that the world will be ready for its next step if the nuclear deal fails due to America
 zaahir he iran ke is agle kadam kaa matlab he parmaanu jang, jo khadi main qayaamat laa degi
 The situation in the Gulf worsened again
 america-iran main tension phir badhane lagi
 Europe has left Iran under American pressure
 saath hi america ke khilaaf iran ne 'parmaanu kadam' uthaane kii chetavanee di he
 This is to say that when it seems that the conditions in the Gulf are getting better
 tab tab phir kuch naa kuch aisa ho jaataa he ki gum-phir kar sui yuddh par atak jaati he
 In fact, Iran hoped that in the last week of August in the summit of G-7 countries in France, the JCPA or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action will not only discuss its nuclear deal but also find some way out
 france ne koshish bhi kii or ain maukey par iran ke videsh mantri ko paris bulaakar unase baat bhi kii magar koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 On the contrary, the US was angry at the Iranian foreign minister's call to France
 aapako bataa den ki jessipie main iran ke saath jo five plus van desh shaamil hai unamem france bhi he
 France is constantly trying to improve the conditions in the Gulf
 magar america ke deal se alag hone or iran par kai maheenon se lage aarthik pratibandhon se ab raashtrapati ruhani kaaphi taish main hai or wo is deal main shaamil france ko aagaah kar rahe hai ki europea desh parmaanu samjhaute se hatate hai to iran bhi apana aglaa kadam uthaane ke liye majaboor ho jayega
 The world understands that Iran's next move means its nuclear program
 iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne ye dhamkee francisi raashtrapati emanuel maikron se phone par baatcheet karte hue di
 Rouhani warned that if the European country did not discuss the new terms in time, they would take a strong step out of the 2015 nuclear deal
 iran ne dhamkee di he ki europea desh shuukravaar tak use ye bataaen ki wo kis tarah apane kachche tel ko vaishvik bazaar main beche
 According to Iran's official spokesman Ali Rabi, Iranian oil should be bought and there should be an easy return of this money
 yahi hamaari baatcheet kaa agenda he

 But the opposition is now targeting the central government on this pretext
 to aalochak isamen 'india shining' kii chhap dekhte hai or iske parinaam ko lekar shankaa jataa rahe hai
 However, the Congress is hopeful that what India Shining Campaign could not do for the NDA
 vah kaam 'bharat nirmaan' kar dikhayega
 Through the campaign, she will be able to reach out to the voters
