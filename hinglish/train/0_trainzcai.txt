 kapil mishra ne isse pehle sanjay singh or ashutosh kii rus yatra ke kharch kaa khulaase kaa daawa kiya tha
 Kapil made a tweet in this regard on Sunday morning
 kapil ne apane twit main likhaa, ' sanjay singh or ashutosh kii rus yatra ko kisne sponcer kiya? arvind kejariwal ko sab pataa tha kya? chand sawaal aaj 11 baje
 'so who has sponsored Russia trip of Sanjay Singh and Ashutosh? Did AK know everything? a few questions today at 11 pm — Kapil Mishra (@kapilmishraaap) May 21, 2017 Kapil Mishra has made serious allegations against Arvind Kejriwal and other leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party after being removed from the post of minister

 Lalu has even taunted that the BJP does not have a leader in Bihar to be a CM candidate

 There is only one leader in the BJP - Narendra Damodardas Modi
 'vot for modi'

 desh ke sabase bade siyaasi soobe uttar pradesh main satta ke singhaasana par 40 saal tak brahmanon kaa varchasv kaayam tha
 The time in the politics of the state changed and the politics changed, so the dominance of the Brahmins was not only reduced, but they were also marginalized
 aise main brahmanon ko ummid thi ki jab bhi soobe main bijepi kii sarkaar aegi to unka pun:uddhaar hoga
 But as soon as the BJP approved the name of Yogi Adityanath for the post of CM, all the aspirations of the Brahmin society were destroyed
 aise main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne mahendra pandeya ko soobe main party kii kaman saupi he
 This Brahmin card of Shah will be able to remove the displeasure of Brahmins from Yogiraj
 upi main sabase zyada brahman siem banesoobe main kareeb 12 fisadi brahman matadaata hai, jo chaar dashak tak soobe kii siyasat ke betaj badshaah banakar satta par kabiz rahe
 Out of the 21 Chief Ministers till date, maximum 6 Chief Ministers came from the Brahmin caste and all of them were from the Congress Party
 iske baad 5 thakur, 5 pichde, 3 vaisya, 1 kysth or ek dalit mukhyamantri bana
 If we look at the total tenure, then the command of the state remained in the hands of the Brahmin chief ministers for 23 years
 bijepi ne kabhi brahman ko nahin banaaya siemcongress ke baad upi kaa brahman matadaata bijepi ke kor votbank ke taur par rahaa he, lekin bijepi ne kabhi bhi kisi bhi brahman ko siem nahin banaaya
 While the BJP government was formed in the state
 iske baavjood brahman bijepi ke sang laga rahaa
 In 2017, when the BJP swept to victory with a thumping majority, the Brahmins would again be hopeful that the Congress days would be overflowing
 lekin bijepi ne yogi adityanath ke naam par siem ke pad kii muhar lagaakar unke armaanon par pani pher diya
 Yogi Adityanath, who belonged to the Brahmin restless Rajput community from CM Yogi, was feeling restless since the state's Brahmin society was made UP CM
 soobe main DGP sahit kaaphi jilon main rajpuj samaaj ke jila adhikari or police adheekshak baitha die gaye hai
 Not only this, the Government Advocate General has also been created from the Rajput society
 yogi ke satta par virajman hote hi purvanchal ke brahman netaa maane jane vaale harishankar tiwari ke ghar police ne chhapemari kii
 The Brahmins considered it action at the behest of a yogi
 raibareli main 5 brahmanon kii hatya se brahmanon main bijepi ke prati naaraazgi or bhi bad gai
 That is why the Brahmin felt himself cheated
 modi ne bhi brahmanon ko kiya darkinaradarasal 2014 main jab narendra modi ke netritv main bijepi jitkar centre kii satta par kabiz hui to soobe ke brahmanon ko laga ki unke samaaj ke mantriyon ko ahm pad navaaje jaaenge
 Modi only included Kalraj Mishra in his cabinet as a Brahmin face from the state, but he too did not get any special ministry
 iske baad dow mahendra nath pandeya ko rajyamantri banaaya
 Veteran leaders like Murali Manohar Joshi were also marginalized
 is baar ke cabinet pherbadal main calraj mishra or mahendra pandeya kii mantralay se chuttee ho gai
 However, Mahendra Pandey has been given the command of UP BJP
 mahendra pandeya ko brahman apana netaa kubul karegabjepi ne saamanjasy baitaane ke liye mahendra pandeya ko upi bijepi kaa adhyaksh banaaya he, lekin jo brahman samaaj ke netaa rahe hai
 These include Narayan Dutt Tiwari, Shripati Mishra, Hemanandan Bahuguna, Kamalapati Tripathi, Harishankar Tiwari, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Murali Manohar Joshi
 inke baraabar apana vajood kaise kaayam rakh paaenge
 Purvanchal is the dehri of Brahmins, Purvanchal is considered to be the stronghold of Eastern Brahmins
 purvanchal main brahman matadaata 16 fisadi se lekar 23 fisadi tak he
 In such a situation, there is the power to create and spoil any political game
 aise main mahendra pandeya bhi purvanchal se aate hai
 He was born in Pakhanpur village of Ghazipur, but settled in Varanasi
 philhal chandauli se loksabhaa saansad hai
 The BJP high command has given him the command of the party in the state, but Mahendra Pandey has no special identity throughout the state
 jabaki bispi main satish chandra mishra or ramvir upaadhyaay hai to vahiin congress ke paas pramod tiwari or jitin prasad hai
 So there SP has many Brahmin faces
 in sabake bich apane aapako kaise khadaa kar paaenge or yogi sarkaar se badhati bechaini ko vah kaise dur kar paaenge
 These are difficult to say
 ranjai trophy itihaas main sabase badi saajhedaari (594 ran) kaa record rachane ke baad maharashtra ke captain swapnil gugale ne pari ghoshit kar kahin badi chook to nahin kar di
 
 
 
 yah sawaal is samay cricket ke jaankaron ke dimag main kaundh rahaa he
 Swapnil Gugale, playing a massive batting performance against the Delhi team at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, played a captaincy innings and added an unbeaten 594 for the third wicket with Ankit Bawne
 is marathon saajhedaari kii dauraan jahaan swapnil ne jahaan 351* banaae vahiin ankit 258* ran banane main safal rahe
 Both these cricketers have the highest score in first-class cricket
 mahaj 17 first class match kaa anubhav rakhane vaale 25 varshiya swapnil kaa pichhlaa sarvaadhik score 174 ran tha jabaki 23 saal ke ankit kaa pichhlaa sarvaadhik score, swapnil ke pichley sarvocch score se mahaj do ran kam, yani 172 ran tha
 In the Ranji Trophy match commencing on Thursday, both of them took a rigorous examination of the Delhi bowlers
 lagbhag do din dilli kii gendbaaj pasinaa bahaate rahe lekin maharashtra ke mahaj do wicket hi gira sake
 The players of Delhi breathed a sigh of relief after Maharashtra captain Swapnil declared the innings at 635 for two
 dilli ke gendbaajon ko puri pari ke dauraan 173, ji haa 173 over phenkane pade
 This 594-run partnership is the biggest partnership in Ranji Trophy history
 577 ran kaa pichhlaa record baroda ke vijay hajaare or gul mohammad ke naam par tha
 Both of them set this record against the Holkar team
 tippaniyan Despite making a big achievement in domestic cricket, swapnil-ankit missed another huge record
 swapnil agar pari ghoshit nahin karte to ho saktaa he ki yah record bhi maharashtra kii is jodi ke naam par hota
 The record for the largest partnership of international cricket is named after Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka
 unhone 624 ran kaa yah record dakshin africa ke khilaaf banaaya tha
 Jayawardene and Sangakkara set this record in Colombo in July 2006
 is dauraan kumaar sangakaara ne 287 or mahela jayavardhane ne 374 ran bana daale the
 swapnil-ankit needed just 31 runs to surpass this record
 maharashtra ke captain swapnil gugale, jo ki khud is saajhedaari kaa hissaa the, yadi pari ghoshit nahin karte to aaj jayavardhane-sangakaara kaa vah record bhi beete jamaane kii baat ban saktaa tha

 maharashtra ke captain swapnil dwaara do wicket par 635 ran ke score par pari ghoshit karne ke baad hi dilli ke khiladiyon ne raahat kii saans lee
 Delhi bowlers had to throw 173, yes 173 overs during the entire innings
 594 ran kii yah saajhedaari ranjai trophy itihaas kii sabase badi saajhedaari he
 The previous record of 577 runs was named after Vijay Hazare and Gul Mohammad of Baroda
 in donon ne yah record holkar team ke khilaaf banaaya tha
 The comments gharelu cricket kii ek badi uplabdhi apane naam karne ke baavjood swapnil-ankit ek or vishaal record apane naam karne se chook gaye
 If Swapnil did not declare the innings, then perhaps this record would have been in the name of this Maharashtra pair
 international cricket kii sabase badi saajhedaari kaa record srilanka ke mahela jayavardhane or kumaar sangakaara ke naam par he
 He set this record of 624 runs against South Africa
 jayavardhane or sangakaara ne yah record july 2006 main colombo main banaaya tha
 During this time, Kumar Sangakkara scored 287 and Mahela Jayawardene scored 374 runs
 swapnil-ankit ko is record ko langhane ke liye mahaj 31 ran kii jarurat thi
 The record of jayawardene-sangakkara today could also be a thing of the past if Maharashtra's captain Swapnil Gugale, who was himself a part of this partnership, did not declare the innings

 vahiin, use rokane ke liye congress baaki vipaksh ke saath milakar sanyukt ummidavaar utaarne kaa man bana rahi he
 There is news from the BJP that Prasanna Acharya, the BJP vice-president and leader of the party in Rajya Sabha, can be fielded for the Deputy Chairman

 bijepi ko rokane ke liye congress samet vipaksh ne aam sahmati se ummidavaar utaarne kaa faisla kiya he
 The Congress can support any opposition candidate to beat the BJP

 In such a situation, the claim of TMC can be stronger from the opposition

 a delegation of Muslim Ulema, led by the Secretary General of the Sunni Ulema Council, met the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh official and asked the Sangh six questions, including whether the Sangh prepared a blueprint for turning India into a Hindu 'nation'
 is
 council kaa daawa he ki in sawaalon se bhagava sanghathan chidh gaya he
 The Muslim delegation claimed that the union official Indresh refused to answer his questions and insisted that a conference of Muslim organizations should be called where he would publicly answer these questions
 sunni ulema council ke mahasachiv haji mohammad salis ne kaha, 'hamane beeti raat sangh ke varisht padaadhikari indresh se mulaakaat kii, jis dauraan hamane chah sawaal kiye lekin unke paas koi jawaab nahin tha
 He alleged that the RSS pracharak and in-charge of minority affairs in the organization, Indresh became 'angry' with these questions
 unhone kaha, 'hamaara pehla sawaal tha ki kya sangh bharat ko ek hindu desh maanata he? doosraa sawaal, kya sangh ne bharat ko hindu raashtra main badalane ke liye koi khaakaa taiyaar kiya he? teesraa sawaal yah ki kya yah hindu ‘raashtra’ hinduon ke dharmik granthon ke anusaar hoga yaa sangh ne koi nayaa falsafa taiyaar he?
 Salis said, "the fourth question is, what do they want on religious conversion?" Fifth question, what kind of nation wants the love of the Union Muslims? The sixth question is how does the Sangh look at Islam? ' He said that these were six questions that Indresh could not answer
 unhone aarope lagaate hue kaha, 'sangh ke paas koi khaakaa nahin he
 They are making noise about 'hindu Rashtra' only on the basis of propaganda
 ' salis ne ashanka jataai ki yadi hinduon ke dharmik granthon ke aadhaar par hindu raashtra kaa nirmaan hota he, to daliton ko ek baar phir se mandiron main pravesh kii anumati nahin hogi
 Salis said, 'we asked whether the Sangh has prepared a new policy? If a new philosophy has been prepared, it means that Hinduism is not a religious culture
 aisi surat main, koi bhi dharm badal saktaa he
 He also said that when the Constitution gives the right to freedom of religion, then why is the Union afraid of bringing the bill
 unhone kaha, 'ham dare hue nahin hai
 If a Muslim does not like Islam and wants to leave, he can leave
 hamaare paas kisi ko majaburi main musalmaan banaae rakhane ke liye koi kanoon nahin he
 Salis said that as far as love for the country is concerned, his ancestors rejected Jinnah and Pakistan
 '1947 main jab do rashtron kii avadharana kaa faisla hua, hamaare purvajon ne jinna or pakistan ko nakaar diya tha or gandhiji ko apane netaa ke rup main, bharat ko apane desh ke rup main sweekaar kiya tha or samvidhan main aasthaa jataai thi
 Salis said, "what do they want from Muslims?" They should sing Vande Mataram and bow to the picture of Bharat Mata which they have envisaged? We will not accept it
 yah islam ke viruddh he
 Salis said, 'the final result of the 90-minute meeting was that the Sangh asked us to call a' conference 'of Muslims and they would answer our questions therein
 ' unhone kaha, 'maine kaha ki jab aap ek kamare main in sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin de sakate, to sammelan main kaise aap inkaa jawaab denge
 After that we asked why we should call the conference
 'sunni ulema concil ke mahasachiv ne bataaya ki in muddon ko lekar muslimon main bechaini he
 He said, 'I came to answer these questions being raised in our community
 ' unhone kaha, 'meraa yah maananaa he ki hamaara dharm koi bhi ho, hamen samvidhan ke prati eemaandaar hona chahie
 Religion is our personal matter
 yah raashtra kaa mudda nahin he
 We do not even support the statements of Asaduddin Owaisi, the leader of All India Majlis a Ittihadul Muslimeen (AIMIM)
 'unhone saath hi kaha, 'jo sampradayik bhavanaaen bhadkaa rahe hai, ve desh ke vafaadaar nahin hai
 The country will follow the principles of Gandhi, it will not do with the statements of the Sangh or Owaisi
 'is bich,indresh or muslim netaonke pratinidhimandal ke bich beeti raat kii is mulaakaat main shaamil nahin hone vaale shahar kaaji ne kaha ki iskaa 'koi matlab' nahin tha, kyonki vah apane samudaay se jude muddon ko uthaane ke liye keval sangh ke pramukh mohan bhagwat se milenge
 'the city Qazi Alam Raza Noori told,' Salias had called us for a meeting, but i had already met Indresh, so there was no point in meeting him again
 main keval tabhi mulaakaat karuunga jab bhagwat hamen bulaayenge
 He said, "if we had met Bhagwat, we would have presented his issues about his agenda of Hindu Rashtra
 indresh ke saath mulaakaat se sanghathan ke nazariye main koi fark nahin padegaa
 He also said that he was out of town at the time of the meeting and would not have met Indresh even if he had been here
 'is bich, 'salis ne kaha kisangh padaadhikarise milane waalon kii suchi main nuri kaa naam nahin tha or ise baad main hi shaamil kiya gaya
 Elaborating on the meeting, Salis said that the delegation, on their perceived silence over Owaisi's comments, told Indresh that Owaisi did not represent the views of the community

 If sources are to be believed, Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary is angry with Sonia Gandhi's position in the Lok Sabha
 sonia gandhi ne isko lekar adheer ranjan se bhi baat kii he
 However, Sonia Gandhi has praised Manish Tiwari's speech and said that Manish Tiwari has correctly conveyed the party's favor
 aapako bataa den ki loksabhaa main jab amit shah ne punargathan bill ko pesh kiya to uske jawaab main adheer ranjan ne kaha ki 1948 se lekar abhi tak jammu-kashmir ke masale par sanyukt raashtra (UN) nigaraanee kar rahaa he, aise main ye aantarik maamla kaise ho saktaa he
 Home Minister Amit Shah was furious just on this statement of Congress leader
 is dauraan sonia gandhi adheer ranjan ke bagal main baithkar ye sab dekh rahi thim or unki baat sun rahi thim
 But when Adhir Ranjan spoke to the United Nations, Sonia Gandhi looked shocked, she turned backwards and pointed something towards the party leaders sitting in the back row
 ishaare se aisa laga ki maano wo kuch puch rahi hon
 How was Sonia Gandhi's reaction, you can see in this video

 input- bhashaa a post shared by Taapsee Pannu (@taapsee) on Mar 12, 2018 at 12:02 am PDT european union ne google par 5 billian dollar kaa jurmaana lagaaya he
 The reason for this is that Google uses Android smartphones to increase the reach of its apps
 european union kii taraf se lage is jurmaane ke baad google ke siio kaa bayaan aayaa he
 He has criticized the European Union's decision that the European Union has ignored the fact that Google's Android operating system competes with Apple's ios operating system
 google ke is blogapost par sundar pichaai kaa ek artical he jisaki heading ye he ki android ne zyada opshan die hai, kam nahin
 The European Union has given Google 90 days to change this business practice
 iske jawaab main sundar pichaai ne kaha he, ‘european union ne android or iske bijness model ke khilaaf faisla diya he
 The given decision ignores the fact that Android phones compete with ios phones
 aaj android kii vajah se har keemat par 1,300 alag alag companiyon se 24,000 se zyada divaais uplabdh hai
 These include Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungry, Italian, Latavian, Romanian, Spanish, and Swedish phone makers
 The biggest reason for the fix is that Google gives its apps preloaded in Android smartphones
 iske jawaab main sundar pichaai ne kaha he, ‘aam taur par android smartphone 40 pre loded eps ke saath aata he
 These apps are not just of the company whose phone is, but they contain many developers' apps
 agar aap koi doosraa ap, broujar yaa search ingine yuj karnaa chaahate hai to aap pre loded eps ko aasaani se disable yaa delit kar sakate hai or iske badale koi doosraa ap yuj kar sakate hai
 1 of these
 6 million europions ke bhi eps hai jo ap developers hai’sundar pichaai ke mutabik ek aam android phone yujar khud se 50 eps install karata he
 Last year, around 94 Bahillion apps have been downloaded from the Google Play Store worldwide
 inamen opera mini or firefox jaise browgers bhi hai jinamein 100 million baar se zyada downlod kiya gaya he, jabaki yusi broujar 500 million se zyada baar downlod kiya gaya he
 What's the whole matter: Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has been given 90 days to change its business practice
 kaha gaya he ki agar aisa karne main company fail hoti he to rojaanaa ke turnover kaa 5 fisadi hissaa jurmaana ke taur par vasuul kiya jayega
 Significantly, this penalty imposed on Google is the highest ever imposed on any one company
 bibisi kii ek report ke mutabik google ke siio sundar pichaai ko is faisle ke bare main compatishan kamishan margret vestager pehle se hi bataaya he
 Why was the penalty imposed? The reason behind this fine on Google is quite simple and if you use Android then you will be familiar with it

 Fake newstwitter closed more than 50 fake accounts in the name of officers
 After the withdrawal of 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan created fake Twitter accounts in the name of Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat and other army officers to spread propaganda
 
 jin sena adhikariyon ke naam se farji twitor handle banaae gaye the, unamem se kuch sena main oonche padon par tainaat hai jabaki kuch ritair ho chuke hai
 However, this conspiracy was soon exposed and the Indian Army closed more than 50 such fake Twitter accounts
 bhartiya sena ke jin adhikariyon ke naam se ye farji twitor acount chal rahe the, unamem sena pramukh ke alaava vaais chif leftinent general devraj ambu, nordarn army commander leftinent general ranvir singh or leftinent general balavant bhi shaamil hai
 General Balwant retired from the post of Central Army Commander last year
 in sabhi twitor acount se vivaadit or farji suchanaaen share kii jaati thim
 One of these fake accounts was made in the name of Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Purohit
 karnal purohit 2008 main maalegaanv main hue blast main aaropee hai
 The incident is reportedly known as the Hindu terrorist conspiracy
 sena ke sutron ne india today ko bataaya, “aise farji twitor handle kii sankhya teji se bad rahi thi
 The idea behind this was to give legitimacy to fake news and propaganda
 ” haalanki, twitor se isaki shikaayat karne ke baad sena ke maujuuda or ritred adhikariyon ke naam chal rahe 50 se zyada farji acount band kar die gaye hai
 Another important name in the names of army officers who were running these fake accounts is that of former Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia
 general bhaatia diji, military aaparishan rah chuke hai or dephence maamalon ke jaankaar ke taur par vishwasaneey cheharaa hai
 According to the rule, army officers cannot put photos in uniform on social media
 ye jitne farji acount the, in sabhi main adhikariyon kii uniform main photo lagi hui thi, jisase koi bhi aasaani se pahchaan saktaa he ki ye farji hai
 The tweets from these accounts named after top officials showed videos of human rights violations or propaganda between civilians and the military to spread propaganda
 sutron kaa kahana he ki kashmir se 370 hatane ke baad in acounts se zyaadaatar twit kashmir ko lekar kiye gaye or iske liye duniya bhar ke puraane videos kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 Now to avoid this, 24-hour surveillance is being done on social media including youtube so that fake accounts can be identified
 sena ke sutron ne bataaya, “in farji acount main kai to 4 se 5 saal pehle banaae gaye the
 Apart from this, there were accounts in the name of many famous Bollywood celebrities who suddenly became hyperactive to spread propaganda and fake news
 ”isi tarah kaa ek twitor acount mashhoor abhinetri rani mukherjee ke naam par tha jo 2014 main banaaya gaya tha
 Similarly, some time ago, many fake letters of army names were put on social media and they went viral on whatsapp and reached the Army Officers

 Shiv Sena had almost the same confusion that the whole Maharashtra rests on their shoulders
 isi mugalate main padakar bhaajapa se gathbandhan tod liya
 The results of the Maharashtra assembly elections have not yet come, but seeing the results of the exit poll, the palace of Shiv Sena's dream must have collapsed
 shivasena or bhaajapa kaa gathbandhan tuutane par sabase zyada hairaan khantee dakshinpanthi hue, jo shivasena ko ‘ugr rashtrawaad’ or bhaajapa ko ‘hindutv’ ke chalate pasand karte the
 Now they have a problem that to whom should you give the title of 'hindu Hriday Samrat'? Not everyone in the Shiv Sena is unhappy, Aditya Thackeray is happily thinking that he is getting 70 seats in the exit poll, only 44 were won in the last elections
 iske pehle chunaav prachaar ke samay jaise bayaan unhone die, bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan tuutane kaa ek phayda najar aayaa
 Everyone came to know that a Rahul Gandhi was hiding inside Aditya Thackeray
 maharashtra or haryana chunaavon ke eczit pole ke anusaar bhaajapa donon rajyon main sabase badi party banakar ubhari he iske baavjood bhaajapa karyaalay main hataasha kaa maahaul vyaapt he
 The BJP workers are not showing any enthusiasm because of the number of seats that Congress can get
 maharashtra main congress ko satta se sattaees par simatana or haryana main 10 se 15 siten milanaa bataaya ja rahaa he,aise main modi kaa congress mukt bharat kaa sapana to kabhi puraa nahin ho sakegaa

 In the party meeting called after the exit poll, many BJP workers were seen saying that they and their leaders had left no stone unturned in campaigning, but the shortage remained in Rahul Gandhi's rallies
 loksabhaa chunaavon main rahul gandhi akele congress ko leading party se bleeding party banane kaa karnama kar chuke hai
 Had two to four rallies done, the Congress could have been reduced to two-four seats
 varisht netaaon kii maane to in chunaavon ke dauraan digvijay singh kaa ek bhi ‘dhang kaa bayaan’ na aana congress ke liye hitkaari sabit hua, saath hi bhavishya ke liye taakid bhi di gai he ki bhale hi narendra modi khud reliyon ko sambodhit na karen par ‘congress mukt bharat’ jaisaa sapana dekhne se pehle ye sunishchit kar len ki rahul gandhi ko nazarandaaj na kiya jaae, kyonki khud narendra modi to pradhanmantri banakar vyast ho gaye, ek vahi bache hai jo congress ko puri tarah mitaane main aaj bhi koi kasar nahin chhod rahe

 Vishwanath Tripathi has been among the rare teachers who used to keep track of their students
 ‘guruji kii kheti-baari’ main shaamil sansmornatmak lekh unke adhyaapan ke dauraan ke hai
 In these articles, they discuss the students

 Dr
 treepathi pehle ‘hindi sahitya kaa sankshipt itihaas’ likhaa tha, jo aaj bhi vidhyaarthiyon kaa maargdarshan kar rahi he
 His book is a reminder of the guru-shishya tradition that is being shattered in this era of marketism
 aaj shikshak diwas par sahitya ajtak par padhie unke kitaab kaa ek mjedaar ansh
 Tripathi ji feels standing in front of his words
 in prishthon main aap raajnneeti kaa vah zamana bhi dekhege jab ‘anshan, dharna, juluus, pradarshan, kranti, uddhaar-sudhaar, vikaas, samaajwaad, ahimsa jaise shabdon kaa arthpatan, anarth, arthghrinaa or arthsharam nahin hua tha
 And university students used to debate Marxism by slapping fists on the tables

 Starred with memories in the eyes of literary-intellectuals like Nagendra, Vishnu Prabhakar, Balakrishna Sharma Naveen, Shamsher and Amartya Sen, this book is woven with many interesting memoirs of Tripathi's own teaching life

 After this, he recalled his first appointment in Nainital and thereafter several incidents of his long past in Delhi University, about which he says: 'if i remember, then i go ahead from Badal

 Book excerpts- Guruji's farming-barhindi department is slightly different from other departments of the university
 usamen desipana, bhades or ujaddpan bhi rahata he
 Guru-bhakti is relatively more among the students

 Students are mostly lower-class, lower-class

 Overall, the atmosphere remains relatively disciplined, especially at the University of Delhi
 aise chaatro kii kaaphi sankhya hoti he, jo padhai ke saath kuch samay ke liye naukari bhi karte hai
 Two things were particularly visible since the ninth decade

 These students are often interested and conscious in reading and writing

 beshak, aise vidhyaarthiyon kii sankhya zyada nahin hoti
 There would have been students who had the ability to succeed in the competition, but would have become teachers
 ekaadh udhaaharan aise bhi hai ki vishvavidhyalay kii naukari chhodkar sakriy raajnneeti main purnakalik kaam karne lage hai
 There were also many of my students who left us in between

 i thought - okay
 shriprakash ghar gaye
 He did not return to Delhi since then
 iske pehle bhi kai baar aisa hota tha ki ve mujffarpur jate the, teen-chaar maheene tak pataa nahin chalata tha

 There was no specific reason for hope to break

 They also came to Patna

 It is said that he would have been very happy at the time of the train passing over the river

 Met his friends
 kisi se koi pataa nahin chalaa
 People were heard saying that he should not have jumped from the moving train in Son or Gandak
 aisa kyon hua, koi nahin jaanata
 One reason for his utter disappointment may be that there was something wrong with his sister's marriage
 mujhe yaad padataa he ki wo parivaar main sabase zyada bahanon ko hi chahta tha
 Can not believe that Sriprakash will not come now
 saamne baithkar muskurayega or hansega nahin—safed daantonwali nishchal hansi! uske paas hansane ke sivaay or rasta kya tha?adhyapakeey jivan-yatra main kai chaatr-chaatraon kii maut kaa samachar mila he

 The Congress said, talking about the good news, the PRSP spokesperson said, the country runs by the Constitution, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Saturday that the people of the state will soon get a good news
 yogi ne gorakhpur main jahaan yah bayaan diya, vah ram katha kaa manch tha
 His statement is seen to be related to the construction of Ram temple
 haalanki unhone ram kaa naam nahin liya tha
 Now his statement has sparked political controversy
 vipakshi congress or shivpal singh yadav kii party pragatisheel samaajawaadee party (prasapa) neyogi adityanathper hamalaa bol diya he

 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne haal hi main kaha tha ki netaaon ko is mudde par bolne se bachanaa chahie, kyonki is maamle kii supreme court main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The Congress spokesperson said in question that what good news is he talking about? Tripathi said that chaos has increased under the rule of the Bharatiya Janata Party

 CP Rai said that the country runs by the Constitution
 agar ram mandir banegaa to bhi yah khushi kii baat he

 bangladesh ke khilaaf team india aakhri vanade 77 ranon ke vishaal antar se jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 This victory has lessened the pain of one-day series defeat, but even during this match, the difficulties of Team India did not leave the chase
 team ke tej gendbaazon kaa pradarshan ekadam lachar rahaa
 Umesh Yadav conceded 33 runs in 4 overs without taking a wicket
 jabaki stuart binni ne 6 overon main 41 ran die
 
 unhen ek wicket mila
 This is the reason that after winning the victory, team captain MS Dhoni said that there is a need to improve Team India in the aspect of fast bowling
 vaise series ke teenon vanade maichon main bharat ke tej gendbaazon kaa pradarshan ummid se kam rahaa
 Bangladeshi batsmen scored easily on their balls
 tippaniyan Dhawal Kulkarni took only 3 wickets for 76 runs in 15 overs in 2 matches, while Bhuvneshwar Kumar got 2 wickets after conceding 69 runs in 12 overs in 2 matches
 vahiin, in donon ke mukaable umesh yadav zyada mahange sabit hue
 He conceded 91 runs in 12 overs from 2 matches and took two wickets
 aise main dhoni ne kaha he ki vanade muqaabale se pehle team ko kis tarah ke gendbaaz chahie, isko lekar kisi nattejey par pahunchnaa hoga
 He said that we have to see whether we need a fast bowler or a bowler who can make the batsmen to make mistakes
 hamaare paas tej gendbaaz to hai lekin ve team ke liye kargar sabit nahin ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, it is not very difficult to understand that Team India needs useful bowlers instead of fast bowlers

 yahi vajah he ki jeet hasil karne ke baad team ke captain emes dhoni ne kaha ki tej gendbaazi ke pahalu main team india main sudhaar kii jarurat he
 However, the performance of India's fast bowlers in the three odis of the series was less than expected

 At the same time, Umesh Yadav proved to be more expensive than these two
 unhone 2 maichon ke 12 overon main 91 ran de die or do wicket hasil kiye
 In such a situation, Dhoni has said that before the one-day match, the team will have to reach a conclusion about what kind of bowlers they want
 unhone kaha ki hamen ye dekhnaa hoga ki hamen tej gendbaaz kii jarurat he yaa phir vaise gendbaaz kii jo ballebaazon ko galati karne par majboor kare
 We have fast bowlers but they are not proving effective for the team
 aise main ye samajhnaa bahut mushkil nahin he ki team india ko tej gendbaazon kii jagah upyogi gendbaazon kii jarurat he

 Parasrana said that there are two types of self-proclaimed ones, one in the form of an idol, the other which manifests itself
 hamaare yahaan bhoomi bhi swayambhu hoti he
 Describing the divinity of the land, the ransom said that there is not necessarily a certain form of God, but ordinary people need a figure to worship in order to focus the attention of the people
 justise bobade ne poocha ki aapako is jameen ko juristic person bataane ke liye divya sabit karne kii jarurat kyon pad rahi he
 a ship is also a judicial person but it is not divine
 paraasaran ne kaha ki saamaanya logon ko puja karne ke liye bhagwaan ke ek rup kii jarurat padati he jabaki jo log aadhyatm main kaaphi upar uth chuke hote hai unke liye ye jarurat nahin padati
 Parasrana said that God cannot be protected unless judicial personality is appointed
 murti swayan juristic vyaktitv nahin he balki iske abhishek ke baad yah nyaayik vyakti ke rup main viksit hoti he
 It has the purpose of worship, which makes it a judgmental person
 court ne kaha ki guuruuvaar ko bhojanavkaash se pehle tak hindu pakshakaar apni daleelein khatm kar len
 Nirmohi Arena will get an hour after Thursday afternoon
 muslim pakshakaar dhawan shuukravaar kii subah suut 4 par bahes shuru karenge
 The court said that now is not the time for everyone to hear separately
 aap hamase wo chiz (samay) maang rahe ho jo hamaare paas he hi nahin
 Earlier, on behalf of the Muslim side, Nizam Pasha said that in the hadith about Wazoo, it was better that Vaju be brought from home to mosque
 hindu paksh kii daleel thi ki babari masjid main vazu karne kii koi jagah nahin thi jis par nizaam pasha ne jirah kii
 Nizam Pasha said that tomb exists near Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah and Dargah in Ajmer and both dargahs also have mosques, so to say that Babri Masjid had a tomb and was not a mosque is wrong
 agar ek vyakti bhi masjid main namaaj padhata he to uske masjid hone kaa states barkaraar rahegaa
 It is wrong to say that Babri Masjid used to be offered prayers only for two times, so the status of its mosque ended
 pasha ne kaha ki quran or haddees ke mutabik bhi koi kaise bhi masjid bana saktaa he
 Mosques can be built on any land without minarets and wazukhanas
 pehle kabhi mandir bhi rahaa ho vahaan bhi masjid banaai ja sakati he
 Even if there is an idol somewhere in the mosque or there are pictures or idols that are not seen in the pillars on the walls, the Namaz is also valid
 pasha ne kaha ki masjidon main ghantiyaan isliye manaa hai kyonki rasul ko ghantiyon kii aawaaj pasand nahin thi
 Ibne Battuta also wrote that there were bells in many places even in mosques in India
 babar panipat kii ladaai jeetne ke baad nizamuddin or qutub sahab kii dargah par gaya
 It is wrong to say that the tomb is not allowed anywhere in Islam
 agar ek baar masjid ban jaae, phir imaarat gir bhi jaae to vah masjid hi rahati he
 Justice Bobde said that is not a condition of constant namaz? Pasha said, even if a person recites namaz, the mosque will exist
 ye kahana bhi galat he ki masjid main sona or khaanaa bananaa manaa he
 It is a social and cultural place
 jamaat main aane vaale yahaan rukate hai
 Justice Nazir said that this is the Indian version of Islam
 supreme court ke chif justise ne kaha ki ayodhya maamle main samay kaa dhyaan he

 supreme court main muslim mahilaon ke kanoonee adhikaar or tripal talaak par sabase badi sunwaayee par puure desh kii nazren tiki hui hai
 The constitutional bench of the apex court will review the case
 ucchtam nyaayalay ne saaf kar diya he ki vah tripal talaak kii samiksha karegi
 However, this is at the core of religion and to what extent it violates fundamental rights
 isapar bhi court sunwaayee karegi
 Nikah Hallala will also be heard if needed
 adaalat bahuvivaah se jude mudde par sunwaayee nahin karegi

 supreme court ne pichhali sunwaayee main tamaam pakshakaron se bhi raay maangi thi
 The Central Government had given questions on its behalf-1
 dharmik swatantraaa ke adhikaar ke tahat talake-biddat (ek baar main teen talaaq kahana), halaala or bahuvivaah kii ijazat di ja sakati he yaa nahin?2
 Who should give priority to right to equality, right to live with dignity and right to religious freedom? 3
 kya personal lau ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 13 ke tahat kanoon mana jayega yaa nahin?4
 Is talaq-biddat, nikah halala and polygamy justified under the international laws that India has also signed? However, written arguments have been submitted before the Supreme Court from all the parties
 centre sarkaar kii ye he daleel-centre sarkaar ne halafanama daayar kar supreme court main kaha he ki tripal talaak ke praavdhaan ko samvidhan ke tahat die gaye samanta ke adhikaar or bhedbhaav ke khilaaf adhikaar ke sandarbh main dekha janaa chahie
 The Center said that gender equality and respect for women cannot be compromised
 bharat jaise secular desh main mahila ko jo samvidhan main adhikaar diya gaya he usase vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Center has said that under Article 14 of the Constitution under the Fundamental Rights, gender equality is a matter
 mahila ko saamaajik, aarthik or bhaavnaatmak tareeke se hashiye par rakhana samvidhan ke anuchhed-15 ke tahat asangat hoga
 The right to self-respect and dignity that a woman has is an important aspect of the right given under Right to Life
 langik samanta or mahilaon ke maan-sammaan ke saath samjhauta nahin ho saktaa
 Triple divorces and polygamy are not protected under religious freedom

 yah punjab ke ek chote se gaanv fillore kii kahani he, isiilie is film kaa naam 'fillori' he
 This is the first film of director Anshai Lal as a director
 anshai ne iske pehle 'chak de', 'pyaar ke said effects', 'himmatwala', 'housephul' or 'dostana' jaisi filmon main bataur assistant diarector kaam kiya he
 Do you know whether 'phillauri' is a film and it is able to captivate the audience or not
 'fillori' ke saath band ho rahaa he 84 saal purana 'reagal'kahani:yah kahani canan (suraj sharma) or anu (mehrin pirjada) kii shaadi se shuru hoti he
 Kanan has to marry a peepal tree before marriage due to being manglic
 us ped par shashi (anoushka sharma) kaa bhoot nivas karata he
 Suraj gets married to Shashi due to marrying the tree and after that Shashi's ghost starts chasing Suraj
 phir kahani main twist tab aata he jab shashi apane flash back ke bare main bataati he or singer fillori (dilajit dosanjh) kaa zikr karti he
 She tells how some incidents have occurred 98 years ago, in which some of Shashi's work is incomplete
 fillori ke liye raper baniin anoushka sharmakamzor kadiyaan:- film main ek hi samay par do kahaniyaan chalati hai, jisase darshakon ko thodaa kanfusion hota he
 This could have been avoided
 - film ke aakhir ke 15 minute kuch zyada hi bor karte hai or jehan main ek hi baat aati he ki aakhir film khatm kab hogi? haalanki yah sirf 2 ghante 17 minute kii film he lekin lagati kaaphi badi he
 - Due to the parallel movement of the two stories, when you try to connect to one, the other comes and you are thinking
 - film main aatma or insaan ke bich baatcheet dikhaai gai he jo kaalpanik to he par climax tak kaalpaniktaa kii had bhi paar hui dikhti he
 - The songs of the film also did not become as popular before the release, due to which some good and some strange sounds during the filming
 anoushka kii vajah se karan or aishwarya kii dosti main ai daraar!jaaniye aakhir film ko kyon dekh sakate hai:dilajit dosanjh, suraj sharma kii acting ke liye aap ek baar film jarur dekh sakate hai
 Anushka Sharma has worked effortlessly in the role of a ghost along with a Punjabi girl
 saath hi baaki casting bhi behtareen he
 The film's VFX is very good
 saath hi diarection ke hisaab se bhi film acchhee he
 The art work is also amazing
 box offis:film kaa bajet lagbhag 21 karod rupee he, jisamen se 12 karod rupee abhi tak satellite or digital ritis ke dwaara aa chuke hai
 Anushka has also become known for her footsteps as a producer
 agar film 30 karod kamaati he to cost ricover ho jaaegi
 a hit at 35 crores and earning crores will be called a super hit
 produsar hone ke naate anoushka ne apni fees nahin lee he
 The film is said to be released in about 1500 screens and an opening of around 25% is being speculated

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator Maulana Masood Azhar, mastermind of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed from Parliament House to Pulwama attack, is an international terrorist from 1 May 2019
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne masood azhar ko aakhirkaar global tebrist qaraar de diya
 But the question is whether this will give Masood the punishment for what he did? Will Masood Azhar's terror end now? So in response, just know that there are already two more international terrorists in Pakistan, one Hafiz Saeed and the other Dawood Ibrahim
 wo 18 baras tak khun ke aansu rulaata rahaa
 He bled India for 18 years
 18 baras tak wo aatank failaata rahaa or ab 18 baras baad jaakar ye mana gaya ki moulana masood azhar international tebrist yani antarrashtriya aatankwaadi he
 Yes, the UN Security Council finally declared jaish-e-mohammed mastermind Masood Azhar on Wednesday 1 May 2019 as an international terrorist
 jo kaam bahut pehle ho janaa chahie tha
 It took him 18 years to come into practice
 pichley 18 saalon se din-raat jo shaks bharat ke khilaaf saazish rach rahaa tha
 Eventually the United Nations sentenced him to do it
 darasal masood azhar ko sanyukt raashtra ne antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit karke use sazaa nahin di
 He is just stunned for being a terrorist
 sazaa to is aatanki ko abhi milani baaki he
 Punishment for the blood of innocents killed in the Parliament attack
 sazaa pathankot main maare gaye masuumon kii
 Punishment for killing people in a blast outside the Srinagar assembly
 sazaa hindustan main hue bees se zyada aatanki hamale karaane kii
 Masood Azhar was released from Indian prison on 31 December 1999 in lieu of Kandhar hijacking
 tab se isane apni zindagi kaa ek hi maqasad banaaya hua tha
 The destruction of India
 jaish jaise sanghathan kaa sargana jis par saikadon begunaahon ke qatl kaa ilzaam he
 Which is the most consummate terrorist in the world
 magar kamaal dekhie ki sanyukt raashtra ne masood azhar ke sanghathan jaish ko to 18 saal pehle yani 2001 main hi aatankwaadi sanghathan qaraar de diya tha
 But it took him 18 years to decide whose organization is a terrorist
 uskaa sargana kaise aatanqavaadi nahin?aisa nahin he ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne pehle kabhi masood azhar ko aatanki ghoshit karne kii koshish nahin kii
 Or he did not have a case to declare Masood Azhar a terrorist
 bharat ne ek nahin kai baar jaish ke is sargana ko aatanki ghoshit kiye jane kaa maamla uthaaya magar har baar vito power kaa istemaal karke china ne adanga laga diya
 But this time China had to bow under the pressure of the world
 pulavama hamale ke baad 27 farvari ko bharat ke samarthan main america, britain or france sanyukt raashtra main ajahar ke khilaaf prastaav lekar aae the
 More than 10 countries supported the proposal
 tay kiya gaya ki agar suraksha parishad ke kisi sadsy ko is par aitaraaz naa ho to jaish ke sargana masood azhar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar diya jayega
 The offer deadline was ending on March 13 at 12:30 pm
 laga is baar to masood ko uske kiye kii sazaa mil hi jaaegi
 But just an hour before the deadline for the proposal, China imposed a hurdle
 haalanki is prastaav par adnge ke baad suraksha parishad ke sadasyon ne china ko saaf chetavanee di ki agar wo masood azhar ko lekar apane rukh ko nahin badalegaa to karrwai ke duusare vikalp bhi khule hai
 In such a situation, there was pressure on China not only India but also other countries
 or aakhirkaar antarrashtriya birdari main apni kirakiri dekh china ne pakistani pradhanmantri ko china bulaayaa
 Convinced Prime Minister Imran Khan to clamp down on Masood Azhar
 haalanki iske badale china ne pakistan ko ye bharosa dilaayaa he ki wo har mushkil vakt main uske saath khadaa rahegaa
 This is the same China that has so far used to stop Masood Azhar from being declared a global terrorist by using the veto in the UN Security Council four times
 pichley 10 saalon main china masood ajahar ko bachaane ke liye chaar baar chaal chal chukaa tha
 In 2009 India itself came up with this proposal
 vahiin 2016 main bharat ne pi-3 deshon (america,france or britain) ke saath milakar prastaav pesh kiya tha
 Then in 2017 only the P-3 countries had proposed this proposal and this time after the Pulwama terror attack, this proposal was brought to France, Britain and America
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main march main hui baithak main haalanki china ne prastaav ko giraane ke liye vito power kaa istemaal nahin kiya tha
 But the proposal was sought for time to consider by putting it on 'technical hold'
 magar ek maheene baad is masale par dobaaraa hui baithak main china ko jhukna padaa or wo jaish ke sargana masood azhar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kiye jane par raji ho gaya 
 After this, China removed Masood's head from there, Masood Azhar was declared an international terrorist
 bihar main bijli kii daren mahangi karne ke bihar vidyut viniamak ayog (regulatory kamishan) ke faisle par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne urja vibhaag ko anudaan se judi samiksha karne kaa aadesh diya he, jisase logon main raahat kii ummid jaagi he
 The Electricity Regulatory Commission (regulatory Commission) on Friday announced a 55 percent hike in electricity rates
 ab tak ko sabase badi badhotaree or upabhoktaaon ke hit ko dekhte hue mukhyamantri ne der raat urja vibhaag ko anudaan (sabsidi) se judi samiksha karne ke aadesh die
 The power burden will be reduced to a great extent by getting the grant
 urja vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv pratyay amrit ne shanivaar ko bataaya ki sarkaar anudaan se judi samiksha karegi
 It will also be decided how much grant should be given to which category of electricity consumers
 unhone kaha, "urja vibhaag dwaara padosi rajyon ke tarriff kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jayega
 It will then be decided how much grant to give in which category
 "tippaniyan It is noteworthy that the regulatory commission had announced new electricity rates in the state on Friday
 bijli daron main lagbhag 55 pratishat badhotaree kii gai thi
 These increases were non-grant
 ayog ne kaha tha ki bijli kii nai daren ek april se lagu hongi
 Never before has such a large increase been made at one time
 ayog ke adhyaksh esake negi ne badi hui daron kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha tha ki yah faisla varsh 2016-17 main hue rajasav ghate ko dekhte hue liya gaya he
 According to the increased rates, electricity consumers in urban areas now have 5 to one hundred units
 75 rupee prati unit ke hisaab se bhugtan karnaa hoga, jabaki pehle iske liye teen rupee prati unit ke hisaab se kharch karnaa padataa tha
 Similarly, electricity rates have been increased in all sections including rural areas, commercial use, domestic use

 The commission had said that the new electricity rates will come into effect from April 1
 isse pehle kabhi bhi ek baar main itani badi vruddhi nahin kii gai thi
 Commission chairman SK Negi while announcing the increased rates had said that this decision has been taken in view of the revenue deficit in the year 2016-17
 badi hui daron ke mutabik shahari kshetra main bijli upabhoktaaon ko ab ek se sau unit tak 5
 75 rupees per unit will have to be paid, whereas earlier it had to be spent for three rupees per unit
 isi tarah gramin kshetron, vyavsaayik upyog, gharelu upyog sahit sabhi virgon main bijli kii daron main badhotaree kii gai he

 Dalit political opinion has its origins in the aspirations of different classes
 dalit raajnneeti vyavastha nyaay, samanta or swatantraaa ke maanavtaavaadi muddon se puri majbootee ke saath bandhi hui he
 Due to inequalities from generations, the demand for justice has been continuously conveying their existential reality
 peedi-dar-peedi adhikaron se vanchit dalit varg saamaajik, dharmik, aarthik, raajnneetik or naitik anyaay kii maar jhelte hue bache rahane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 Today, the Dalit community is collectively demanding equality
 yah kisi kii mehnat or uski yogyata se arjeet kamai chhinane kii baat nahin rahaa
 But it is certainly unhappy with the non-payment of the labor of its ancestors and continues to this day
 daliton kii sabhi baithkon, sabhaaon or nijee baatcheet main daman ke sabhi sambhavit tareekon se aazaadee paane kaa mudda rakhaa jaataa he, chaahe vah kisi bhi tarah se sambhav ho
 Any person who sees these issues objectively can say that every person should get freedom from injustice
 lekin jativaadee or amanviya soch rakhane vaala vyakti kisi bhi cheez ko 'adhikaar' kaa rup dekar daliton kii yugachetana kii baat karegaa
 In the eyes of India's wealthy and non-toiling ruling elites are Dalit slaves who do not have the right to equality and justice
 apane vikaas ke liye inkaa istemaal karne vaale ye sabase achche raajnneetik shabd-nirmaan hai
 And what is the background behind all this? The Modi government, which came to power with the lowest vote share (31 per cent) so far, has been ahead in fudging the aspirations and expectations of Dalits
 iskaa pramaan he desh bhar main daliton par ho rahe hamale, yahaan tak ki daliton ko peet-petakar maar daalane kii ghatnaayen, college parisaron main ye chaatr khud ko kamjor pate hai
 People from political, social organizations in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are arrested arbitrarily and are told to engage in seditious activity
 2018 ke bajet main daliton ke liye keval 6
 55 percent was allocated while their proportionate allocation was 16
 6 fisadi baithta he
 This repression led to adverse reactions according to Newton's law and a new energy has arisen in Dalit politics
 dalit utthan ko lekar desh bhar main saraahna kaa bhav dekhne ko mila he
 Anywhere and any work of Dalits in the country is being seen as a compliment in the Dalit society
 isiilie saharanpur main ek karishmai yuva netaa chandrashekhar aaazaad ravan ko dalit yuvakon main ek nayak ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Similarly, Gujarat's Dalit legislator Jignesh Mevani, who is leaning towards the left, has gained fame across the country, which is more than his political status
 dalit yuvaaon main ab aise netritv kii chaah he jo karishmai ho, josh se bharaa ho jo satta pratishthan se safagoi se baat kare, jo daliton kii takalifon ko deshbhar main bade paimaane par ujagar kare
 Naturally, the old big Dalit political parties are very much empowered by this changed air and are worried about the changing thinking of the youth
 vastav main mayawati daliton kii sabase badi netaa or is samudaay kii sabase badi ummid bhi hai
 Coming from a well-educated background as a cadre of the social movement, Mayawati has been a part of the movement that formed the BSP (bahujan Samaj Party)
 maujuuda samay main rashtriya str par ve daliton kii sabase bharosemand netaa hai
 Mayawati, a calm and restrained leader with the ability to take decisions with courage, resigned from the Rajya Sabha membership because she was not given enough opportunity to speak on the issue of atrocities on Dalits in Saharanpur
 mayawati kaa kad bahut bada he
 But she would have achieved even more if she had kept her heart open in establishing good contacts with regional Dalit parties
 tamilnadu main jahaan anusuchit jati kii aabaadi 19 fisadi he, dalit raajnneetik partiyaan gathbandhan main rahanaa pasand karti hai, saath hi sthaneey nikaay or vidhansabha main jaateey ganit apane paksh main karne kaa bhi puraa dhyaan rakhti hai
 Take the VCK (viduthalai Chiruthaigal Kachi) as an example, it has tied up with the DMK keeping Dravidian politics at the center and has fielded only two candidates — the party's strongman Tirumavalavan and party general secretary Dr
 ravi kumaar jo lekhak or prakaashak bhi hai
 In Maharashtra, Prakash Ambedkar formed an underprivileged Bahujan Aghadi in alliance with Asaduddin Owaisi and decided to contest all 48 seats
 maharashtra kii dalit raajnneetik ladaai apekshaakrit rup se thodi jatil he
 Most Dalit political parties claim to be Ambedkarites and Buddhists
 yahaan basapa bhi ek badi samasya he jo hameshaa khel bigaadpee kaa kaam karti rahi he
 And now the General Secretary of BSP and the face of the party in South India, Dr
 suresh maane ke netritv main ubharne vaali nai party biarespi (bahujan republic socialist party) ladaai main shaamil ho gai he
 The bsp's strong regional presence is evident from the votes it has received in the states, as recently as Chhattisgarh (19)
 5 dalit aabaadi main se 3
 9 percent vote share), Madhya Pradesh (5 percent vote share out of 15 percent Dalit population) and Rajasthan (4 percent vote share in 17 percent Dalit population)
 telugana main jahaan 16 fisad aabaadi dalit he, basapa ko 2
 Could get 1 percent votes
 is chunaav main daliton ke saamne vikalp kya hai? daliton ke saamne ab dharmanirpeksh or utaar-chadhaav bhare itihaas vaali partiyon ke saath pragatisheel gathbandhan he
 On the other hand there are communal hatred parties which are hoping to get the support of Dalits, which they have been suppressing for years so that they can sow the seeds of Partition
 aaj har party ambedkar ke agenda, saamaajik or aarthik nyaay kii baat karti he lekin daliton kii swatantraaa ke liye unki patibaddhta kahin najar nahin aati
 Dalits want employment, land, equal opportunities, healthcare, high level education but apart from these material demands they also want to annihilate caste which is like a curse in Brahminical parties
 in partiyon kii daliton ke kalyaan main koi dilchaspee nahin he
 Rather, they want to create a section of some greedy Dalits who tell the rest of the community that they can wish for a little freedom in the existing structure
 saath hi ye maujuuda tantra main maamuli badlaav kii ummid kar sakate hai, puraa system badalane kii nahin
 These trained Dalit cadre people are sent to contest elections and this further strengthens the Brahminical agenda
 unke paas paisa he or uske bal par ve dalit samudaay kaa samarthan kharid sakate hai or gaiyr daliton (dalit virdohi) kaa samarthan hasil kar sakate hai
 There is no scope for any autonomous Dalit rights project in such political opportunism
 maujuuda sarkaar ke hindutv abhiyaan ne daliton ko bich raste main chhod diya he
 The government does not have any Dalit leader who has a good footprint in this community
 daliton ko pratik ke rup main lete hue brahmanvaadi partiyaan—jaise bhaajapa, congress or anya prabhavi jati aadhaarit hindu dal or kuch had tak bhartiya communist party-keval unase maalik or gulam jaise sambandh hameshaa banaae rakhana chaahati hai
 You can see why a leader like Mayawati has so much importance for Dalits
 ve ek aisi netaa hai jo brahman pratik ke taur par satish mishra jaise netaa ko apane saath rakhti hai jo brahmanvaadi partiyon ke siddhanton ko hi ulte tareeke se lagu karne jaisaa he
 She now wants to expand and for this to take the BSP to completely untouched areas
 obisi or musalamaanon main unke prati ek swaabhaavik aakarshan he
 But they had to struggle with the alliance
 ek vakt par to ve endie ke saath chali gayi, haalanki baad main samarthan waapas liya
 This shows how they are struggling to advance Dalit politics
 ve hameshaa se chaahati rahi hai ki ek vistrut gathjod kaa hissaa banane ke saath puri takat se saamaajik or aarthik nyaay ke parivartankaree kaam kiye jaaen
 In spite of all the racist ridicule, an able administrator like Mayawati can be effectively curbed the BJP and its terror business by elevating it to the top post of the country
 aakhirkaar pragatishiltaa ke pairokaar majboot dalit mahila kii aawaaj ko saamne laane ke sarokaar main mayawati ke bajaay kise chunenge? unke paas koi vikalp nahin he, ye vakt mayawati kaa he

 Former forest officer and 'aranya' institution president Narendra Singh said here that according to the WWF report, since the beginning of the 20th century, about 95 percent of the tigers have been eradicated from the earth, which is a terrible situation for Asia as a whole
 narendra singh ke anusaar, ham is sthiti se inkaar nahin kar sakate ki baagh billi parivaar kii sabase badi prajati he or is grah par sabase khubasurat bhi he

 The Income Tax Department has announced that up to Rs 15 lakh reward will be given to informers who give actionable information about such determinations, which owes the government huge tax and money
 tippaniyan The department last week issued a series of new instructions to all its offices across the country, stating that if a person gives reliable information against a declared defaulter, a reward to those who reported 10 percent of the tax collected from them i will give it, but this amount of reward will not be more than Rs 15 lakh

 phir watamor hon yaa flechar, ve sari cheez nahin jaanate
 i think your best coach is your fellow player, who can understand your weaknesses very well
 iske alaava bhashaa kii samasya ke kaaran bhi videshi coach upmahadweep main safal nahin ho pate
 The great all-rounder said in the discussion during the SIET Cricket Awards on Friday night, India was the number one team and they should have kept this level, but they could not do it
 kapil ne iske saath hi bhartiya upmahadweep main videshi coach rakhane kii parpanra par bhi kadaa prahaar kiya
 He also criticized former captain Sourav Ganguly in this regard, for the first time as a captain, the Indian team had appointed foreign coach as John Wright
 kapil ne kaha, ganguli ne videshi coach bulaakar sahi nahin kiya tha
 We also have many players who can prove to be better coaches
 unhone kaha, mujhe to pehle coach shabd par hi aapatti he
 You can call him a manager, not a coach
 phir watamor hon yaa flechar, ve sari cheez nahin jaanate
 i think your best coach is your fellow player, who can understand your weaknesses very well
 iske alaava bhashaa kii samasya ke kaaran bhi videshi coach upmahadweep main safal nahin ho pate
 Kapil said, Ganguly did not correct by calling him a foreign coach
 hamaare yahaan bhi kai khilaadi hai, jo behatar coach sabit ho sakate hai
 He said, i only object to the word coach first
 use aap manager kah sakate hai, coach nahin
 Whether Watmore or Fletcher, they don't know the whole thing
 mere vichaar main aapkaa sabase acha coach aapkaa saathi khilaadi hota he, jo aapaki kamajoriyon ko acchhee tarah se samaj saktaa he
 Apart from this, foreign coaches are not able to succeed in the subcontinent due to language problem

 Pakistan has defeated India in the final of Champions Trophy
 kareeb 8 saal baad pakistan ne team india ko isisi toornament main haraa paane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 Talk about the day on Sunday, it was completely Pakistan's name
 pakistan kii ballebaaji or gendbaaji to shandaar thi, usko bhagya bhi saath de rahaa tha
 Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman, who scored a century (114 runs) in the match, was caught behind the wicket off Jasprit Bumrah at the beginning of the match but the umpire indicated a no-ball
 tippaniyan After this, the Pakistani batsman beat the Indian bowlers fiercely
 is bich kai baar ran out ke bhi maukey aae lekin uskaa phayda team india ke filder nahin uthaa sake jaisaa kii pehle kisi match main bahut kam dekhne ko mila he
 The most surprising moment was when one of Jaspreet Bumrah's yorkers could not handle Mohammad Hafeez and the ball hit the stumps
 
 
 lekin yah kya
 
 yahaan bhi kismat ne pakistan kaa saath diya
 
 stump to kya gilliyaan tak tus se mas nahin hui
 As a rule, until the gills fall, the out is not considered
 hafeez ko bhi ek jeevandaan mil gaya
 The ball was shown in replays on TV several times and commentators also acknowledged that luck is completely with Pakistan today
 gauratlab he ki pakistan ne harfanmaulaa khel kaa pradarshan karte hue ravivaar ko maujuuda vijeta bharat ko isisi champions trophy ke final main 180 ranon ke baari antar se haraa diya he
 Pakistan had given a target of 339 runs
 lekin team india 30
 Only scored 158 runs in 3 overs
 iske baad pakistan ke is ballebaaj ne bhartiya gendbaajon kii jamkar dhunaai kar daali
 In the meantime, there were occasions of run-out too, but the team's fielder could not take advantage of it, as it has seen very little in any match before
 sabase hairaan karne vaala vah pal tha jab jasprit bumraah kii ek yorker ko mohammad hafeez sambhaal nahin paae or gend stump se takaraa gai
 
 
 But what is this
 
 Luck also supported Pakistan here
 
 Did the stumps not budge even to the gills? jaisaa ki niyam he ki jab tak gilliyaan gir na jaaen out nahin mana jaataa he
 Hafeez also got a life lease
 is gend ko tivi par kai baar riple main dikhaaya gaya or camentataron ne bhi maan liya ki aaj kismat puri tarah se pakistan ke saath he
 Significantly, Pakistan, while performing all-rounder game, defeated the defending champions India in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy by a huge margin of 180 runs on Sunday
 pakistan ne 339 ranon kaa lakshya diya tha
 But Team India 30
 3 overon main sirf 158 ran hi bana pai

 kya ab 'safai' kii vah jarurat ab bhi bachi hui he yaa swatchta abhiyaan ke jhonke main kahin bah gai he?3
 Has your old understanding on political and social issues disturbed you? Is this seen as a change of your political heart? Till now you have disagreed with your own saying against BJP? 4
 kya mahila shashaktikaran ke apane abhiyaan ko aap bijepi main bhi kaayam rakhengi? rape or dangon ke maamalon main namjad mantriyon ke khilaaf virodh darj karaayengi? khaaki vardi pahani he aapane, sakshiyon or sadhviyon kii badjubaani ko dephend to nahin karengi naa?5
 It was you who expressed a desire to remain 'apolitical' i
e
 'non-political' after separating from the Aam Aadmi Party
 kisi dal main jane kii khabaron ko aap khaarij karti raheen
 But if the chair of the BJP CM candidate looked empty, he turned his back on his principles
 aap nijee phaayde ke liye nahin, deshseva ke liye bijepi main gai hai, yah maanane kaa hamaare paas kya kaaran he? nai party banaakar chunaav ladanaa ek tarah kaa sangharsh he
 It involves a lot of bets
 lekin lagaataar jeet rahi ek sthapit party main jane ke myne duusare hai
 It is a 'privilege', here you can get more for yourself
 aise main ham aapako avasarwaadi or swaarthee kyon na maane?6
 Now it is suspected that you have been very political since the time of the movement? Is it not that while sitting on Anna's platform and speaking, the strings of your heart were connected with BJP? 7
 bijepi bhi usee raajnneetik vyavastha kaa ang he jiske khilaaf anna kaa andolan hua tha
 Then had to go to BJP, then what was bad Congress? Or was he concerned that he did not make you a commissioner despite all his abilities? 8
 mukhyamantri hi bananaa tha to 2013 main aam aadmi party kaa mukhyamantri ummidavaar banane kaa prastaav kyon nahin sweekaar kiya? yaa sambhav he aapako AAP kii sarkaar banane kaa koi andeshaa na rahaa ho

 Many young men came to this difficult path due to your trust
 jab ve bahut aage bad chuke hai or ek ahm ladaai ke muhane par hai, tabhi aap haath chhudaakar shortkat kii ore bhaag gai hai
 So again i repeat, your joining BJP is not a problem, but fighting against congress-bjp is against joining BJP

 insaan ke sharir par paye jane vaale til kai raaj kholte hai
 Mole gives many clues to our future
 parashar muni ke hora shaastra main tilon kaa ullekh he
 It is also mentioned in the Puranas
 aaj ham tilon ke rahasy ko kholenge
 a mole found on the left side of women is considered auspicious, a mole found on the right side of men is auspicious, if a mole is on the forehead, a person is lucky, if there is a mole in the middle of the eye, it becomes very rich
 Marriage will happen soon
 Life partner will get lucky
 Due to having a mole on the left eye, there is a lot of hindrance in the actions of a person, there should be a mole around the eyes
 The nature is sweet, it is not considered lucky to have sesame on the people
 If there is a mole in the village, it is successful in life by working very hard, but he makes his own destiny
 If he has a mole, the life partner is from the rich family only after marriage

 a new government will be formed in Jharkhand in the next few days
 chunavi rujhaan se saafe he ki is baar janata ne bahumat kii sarkaar banane kaa prayaas kiya he
 How meaningful this effort will be, it will be known from the result
 lekin, logo main sabase zyada is baat ko lekar jigyaasa he ki agali sarkaar kaa bhrashtachar ke mudde par kya rukh hoga
 No cabinet has remained untouched by corruption charges from Babulal Marandi, the first government in Jharkhand
 ye bhi ek mahaj sanyog hai ki pehali sarkaar main karpshan ke mudde par sabase zyada aarope chal rahe hai or us samay samta party ke vidhayak or purv mantri lalachanda mahato ko is baar bijepi ne apane tikat par maidan main utaara
 How much the public accepts this decision of the party, they will be able to know in the coming 24 hours

 saath-saath charchit anos ekka samet kai daagi chaabi ke log apni kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 So far, due to the coalition government, most of the corruption cases against the tainted people, whether it is the CBI or the state watchdog, could never reach its logical conclusion
 jharkhand ek aisa rajya he jahaan rajya vidhansabha ke chunaavon main 81 main se 30 se adhik vidhayak fanse hai
 mlas of all parties were accused in this, but no party ever showed any interest in taking action against them

 The shocking facts quoted by Shiva in front of the court, additional advocate general of Rajasthan Anand Purohit, seem to be the same
 purohit ke mutabik, shiva ne police ko bataaya he ki asaram raat main niyamit taur par apni ‘dhyaan kii kutiyaa’ main mahilaon se ekant main mila karata tha taaki unhen ‘chaga’ kar sake
 If Shiva is opening the secret of Baba's secluded union, then what will happen when Shilpi comes to the hands of the police

 trivedi jaanch ayog kaa gathan kiya tha
 Testifying before him, many former devotees told how Asaram misbehaved with and exploited women on the pretext of the love affair of Lord Krishna and Radha
 aisa hi ek halafanama baba ke ahmedabad ashram ke prabandhak rahe raju chandak ne daakhil kiya tha jisamen usne kaha ki use pehali baar asaram ke kukarmon kaa pataa 2001 main laga
 At that time a 17-year-old girl from a business family from Bihar came with her widowed mother
 chandak ne kaha ki ladki ko bataaya gaya tha ki asaram ke saath sex karnaa ishwar kaa prasad paane jaisaa he
 He also claimed to have seen Baba in an objectionable state with an NRI woman
 haalanki asaram ke bhakton kaa kahana he ki chandak blackmailer he or uski asaram se dushmani he
 But how can they cut off the 38th verse of Sri Gurugita composed by Asaram, stating that "the devotee should surrender his body, soul and even his wife" to the Guru
 yah pustak sabarmati asaram ashram kii yogavedant seva samiti ne prakashit kii he
 Not only this, after being accused of sexual assault, Asaram had said that he was not able to have sex, but when the police conducted a manhood test of this 72-year-old Baba, he passed very comfortably

 Prajapati has worked at the Motera Ashram in Ahmedabad

 Amrit Prajapati told the media that many of the alleged deaths in various ashrams of Asaram should also be investigated now
 unka daawa he ki aatmahatya kahkar nazarandaaj kii gai in mauton kii vajah kuch or bhi ho sakati he
 Such allegations are once again raising the head that exploited women are kept only in three ashrams meant for women

 com Anita Bharti is a Dalit writer
 dalit hone ke saath stri bhi hai
 The experiences of Anita Bharti can be found in two of the most popular but unlikely discussions going on at the present time
 dalit vimarsh or stri vimarsh unki kahaniyon ke anivaary rachana sandarbh hai
 Along with these composition references one can recite the Samyakshi story collection Ek Thi Kotewali and other stories
 lekin kuch kahaniyaan vimarshaparakata se rahit bhi hai
 Difference in thinking, motherhood, nee haramzadiyya etc
 are similar stories
 jivan, vichaardhaara or sahitya ke trikon main sahitya kaa aadhaar jivan hona chahie, maatr vichaardhaara nahin
 Literature created in the absence of life will become mechanical
 vimarsh or vichaardhaara kaa atikaraman jivan main hameshaa sambhav bana rahata he
 Many of Bharati's stories also transgress the bandha-bandhite tradition of Dalit discourse
 aisa atikaraman omprakash valmiki kii kahaniyon main bhi miltaa he
 Anita Bharti tries to combine varna consciousness with class consciousness in multiple stories
 beej bank, nila pahaad laal suraj aadi aisi kahaniyaan hai, jahaan ve dalit samaaj ko majdoor varg ke saath dekhne-dikhaane kii koshish karti hai
 Ninety percent of the total laborers belong to the Dalit class
 ' yah baat dalit vimarsh kaa arth-vistaar karti he
 And also broadens the scope of Bharti's concerns
 yah dalit vimarsh ko vargeey bhav-bodh se jodna bhi he
 The collection has a total of fifteen stories, small and large
 inke treetment main lekhika ne unhen andolandharmee banane kaa bhi prayaas kiya he
 Meaning Dalit woman discourse Dalit woman takes the form of consciousness and movement
 yah sthiti vishmata-bodh ke baad us vishmata ko paatane kii chatapataahat kaa sanket he
 This spontaneity can be seen in many of the collection's stories
 vartmaan poonjeevaad ke amanviya swaroop main dalit-vanchit samaaj kis tarah yatnaa-shoshan ke nae roopon kaa saamana kar rahaa he, ise dikhaane kii koshish beej bank, sidhaa prasaaran or thakur kaa kuna part tu main kii gai he
 In the seed bank story, a Dalit young man from Kusia village became the principal agent of his locality in a multinational seed company named Mohan Superv
 apni shiksha kaa laabh vah apane gaanv waalon ko bhi dena chahta he par uski company ke bijon se taiyaar fasal ne uske gaanv ke kisaanon ko barbaad kar diya
 The farmers started going bankrupt when the additional yields produced from these seeds were not found on time
 jaldi hi ugaae gaye tamaato chaaron ore sadane lage
 The atmosphere of mourning spread far and wide
 ek kisaan chandu ne aatmahatya kar lee
 He was a friend of Mohan
 yah kahani aaj ke daur kii sabase bhayanak ghatana bhumandalikaran or kisaanon kii aatmahatya ke sandarbh main pathneey lagati he
 In the live telecast title story, two forms of exploitation face-to-face communication media and caste system have been attacked
 dilli ke ek dainik akhbaar main aparaadh jagat par kollam likhane vaale bhaskar dube ko ek saath do khabaren milti hai
 Priyanka suicide case and Sunita rape, murder case
 ek ghatana kaa sambandh haai profile samaaj se he, duusare kaa ek pichde-aviksit gaanv chhinaura se
 Bhaskar and the media persons are interested in high profile matters
 dalit samaaj se sambandhit ghatana-yatharth ko sanchaar madhyam upekshit maanakar chhod dete hai
 This situation chooses the urge and need for reality in today's time and literature
 samay abhaasi yatharth athwa uttar yatharthwaad kaa nahin, yatharth ko nae sire se pahchaanane kaa he
 This story presents Dalit discourse in a better readable form
 kahani kii avashya padhi jane vaali panktiyaan hai: ''bhaskar ko laga ki sunita kaa cese bahut hi saadhaaran he or aaj kii patrakarita kii bhashaa main kahen to lo profile he, gaanvon main aisi na jane kitni ghatnaayen ghatati rahati hai
 How much and how long they will be published in newspapers
 sunita ke saath balaatkaar karne waalon main agar koi netaa, mantri yaa oonche kad kaa raajnneetijna shaamil hota to khabar acchhee banati
 
 
 '' (P

 ye panktiyaan yah dikhaane ke liye paryaapt hai ki sabhi logon ne apane hit ke anuroop anyaay ke hisse kar liye hai
 The story of fighting everyone against everyone raises this as an indication
 bharti kii kahaniyon main ditels or sookshm paryvekshan kaa abhaav he
 Many stories remain descriptive
 pathbhrasht kahani main pratikatmak naamon kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 But Bharti's stories expose the dualistic character of the so-called enlightened class, along with narrating the pain of being a woman and a Dalit

 There was only one aspect of the debate on corruption: the constant attack on the unfortunate government

 Madhavan Nair, the country's well-known scientist and former head of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), said that some of the verses of the Vedas mention the presence of water on the moon and that astronomers like Aryabhatta had been referring to the force of gravity much earlier than Newton
 Knew it
 padam vibhushan se navaaje ja chuke 71 saal ke nair ne kaha ki bhartiya vedon or pracheen hastlekhon main bhi dhaatukarm, bijganit, khagol vigyaan, ganit, vaastukala evam jyotish-shaastra ke bare main soochna thi or yah jaankaree us vakt se thi, jab pashchimi deshon ko inke bare main pataa tak nahin tha
 Addressing an international conference on the Vedas, Nair said that the information given in the Vedas was in a 'concise form', making it difficult for modern science to accept them
 nair ne kaha, ek veda ke kuch shlokon main kaha gaya he ki chandramaa par jal he, lekin kisi ne is par bharosa nahin kiya
 Through our Chandrayaan mission we were able to detect it and our country is the first to find it
 unhone kaha ki vedon main likhi sari baaten nahin samajhi ja saktin, kyonki ve clishtha sanskrit main hai
 In praise of the fifth-century astronomer-mathematician Aryabhata, Nair said, "we are really proud that Aryabhata and Bhaskar have done extensive work on the subject of planets and outer planets
" yah ek chunauteepurn kshetra tha
 He said, even Aryabhata's equation was used for Chandrayaan
 gurutvkarshan kshetra ke bare main bhi
 
 
 Newton came to know about it about 1500 years later

 Nair, who was president of ISRO from 2003 to 2009, also claimed that geometry was used for computation in the construction of cities during the Harappan civilization, and Pythagorean theory has existed since the Vedic period

 He further said that many posts reserved for Dalits are vacant and the truth is that the government is not seriously implementing Dalit reservation
 yahi nahin, mayawati ne kaha ki daliton ko padonnati main bhi aarakshan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 BJP should strengthen the reservation policy

 america-mexico seemaa par prastaavit diwaar karadaataaon ke saikadon arab dollar bachaayegi
 Explain that the proposal to build travel visas and walls is being implemented only after Trump came to power

 What is Trump's decision? US President Donald Trump, while executing his promises during the election campaign, signed two executive orders related to the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico and the deportation of migrants living without valid documents
 In addition, he said that a country is not a country without borders
 grih suraksha vibhaag main do kaaryakari adeshon par hastakshar karte hue trump ne kaha ki ek desh bina simaaon ke desh nahin ho saktaa
 Starting today, the US will regain control of its border
 america raashtrapati bole ki ham hamaari dakshin seemaa par sankat kaa saamana kar rahe hai

 raashtrapati banate hi ection main trump, diya mexico se lagi seemaa par diwaar nirmaan kaa aadesh The flames of Holika Dahan are very good
 holikaa dahan kii agni main har chintaa khaak ho jaati he, dukhon kaa naash ho jaataa he or ichchhaaon ko purna hone kaa vardaan miltaa he
 In this festival of the victory of good over evil, the importance of colors is as much as that of Holika Dahan
 ye manyata he ki vidhi vidhaan se holikaa puja or dahan karne se mushkilon ko khatm hote der nahin lagati
 The special thing is that this time Holika Dahan will not be in Bhadra
 panditon kaa kahana he ki holi par agar aap vidhi vidhaan se parikrama kar sahi prasad chadha den to khaali jholii bharte der nahin lagegi
 Because this time Holika Dahan is being made very auspicious coincidence
 ravivaar ko uttara phalguni nakshatra main manaaya jayega holikaa dahan kaa parv
 According to the day and constellation, the lord of both is the Sun which is present in Pisces, Pisces is the future zodiac sign and Sun will be very fruitful in Pisces
 vahiin duusari ore rahu, shani or mangal teenon grah vraki chal rahe hai jiske kaaran maa kaali, maa tara, mata bhubaneshwari or maa chhinmistka kii puja aapako dilaaegi holikaa puja kaa purna fal
 Sun will also get the power of the moon due to the full moon, due to which if you take a decision related to business, money or education related matters between this auspicious planetary conditions, then you will surely get success
 itnaa hi nahin agar aap lambey samay se kisi beemaari se pareshaan hai yaa phir shatruon kii badhati sankhya ne aapaki chintaa badha rakhi he to is baar holikaa dahan kii lapaton main aapaki samast chintaaen jalakar khaak ho jaaengi
 Parikrama is considered very important in Holika Puja and Dahan
 kehete hai parikrama karte hue agar apni ichha kah di jaae to wo sach ho jaati he
 Just according to your wishes, you have to do a circumambulation of Holika
 jaisi kaamana utani hi baar parikrama
 Apart from circumambulation, burning of dung cakes in Holika Dahan is also very important
 kitne upale jalaaen, kis aakaar ke upale jalaaen ye bhi aapako apni manokamana ke hisaab se tay karnaa hoga
 Parikrama and Upale will not only make your dreams a reality, the importance of offerings is also no less
 chaahe aapako sukh samruddhi kii darkaar ho yaa phir videsh yatra kerani ho, sawaal nai naukari kaa ho yaa phir santan kaa aashirwad chahie, holi par kuch khaas tarah kaa prasad chadhaane se ye icchhaaen bhi puri ho sakati hai
