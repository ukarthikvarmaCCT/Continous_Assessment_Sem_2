 The source of the Samaveda which was composed to praise Shiva, which was sung by Ravana, is still known as ravana-stroth and Shiva Tandava Stroth
 shiv puja ke ant main is ravanakrut shiv tandav stotra kaa pradosh samay main gaan karne se yaa padhane se lakshmi sthir rahati he
 Among all the other hymns composed and worshiped by Lord Shiva, the Shivatandava Stotra composed by Ravana or performed by Ravana is very dear to Lord Shiva, such is the belief of Hindu religion and is believed to have been praised by Shivatandava Stotra to Lord Shiva
 The person never lacks wealth, plus one gets excellent personality
 yani vyakti kaa cheharaa tejasvi banataa he tathaa uske aatmavishvaas main bhi vruddhi hoti he
 Any accomplishment that a person aspires to by reciting the Shivtandava Stotra daily, is easily accomplished by the grace of Lord Shiva
 saath hi aisa bhi mana jaataa he ki is stotra ke niyamit paath se vaani siddhi kii bhi prapti hoti he
 That is, whatever the person says, it starts happening
 nrity, chitrakala, lekhan, yoga, dhyaan, samadhi aadi siddhiyaan bhagwaan shiv se hi sambandhit hai, isliye shivatandav stotra kaa paath karne vaale ko in vishyon se sambandhit safalataa sahaj hi praapt hone lagati hai
 Not only this, Shani is considered to be Kaal while Shiva is Mahakal, so a person suffering from Saturn gets a lot of benefit from its recitation
 saath hi jin logon kii janm-kundalee main sarp yoga, kaalsarp yoga yaa pitru dosha hota he, un logon ke liye bhi shivatandav stotra kaa paath karnaa kaaphi upyogi hota he kyonki hindu dharm main bhagwaan shiv ko hi aayu, mrityu or sarp kaa swami mana gaya he

 '' congress ne loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye mangalvaar ko apana ghoshnaptr jari kiya
 The Congress has promised in the manifesto that the Armed Forces (privileges) Act (AFSPA) coming into power will be reviewed
 ise lekar bijepi congress par hamalavar ho gai he
 From BJP President Amit Shah to Union Minister Arun Jaitley, the Congress is taking the Congress to the forefront of AFSPA
 lekin, bijepi bhi congress kii tarah hi AFSPA kii samiksha kaa vaada kar chuki he
 Congress has promised in its manifesto that it will amend the Armed Forces (privileges) Act (AFSPA) 1958 to balance the rights of the security forces and the human rights of citizens, and the relaxation of forced disappearances, sexual violence and torture ( Immunity)
 bataa den ki AFSPA kanoon ke tahat sena ko kuch vishesh adhikaar mili hai
 The army can arrest anyone and can also carry out firing in the event of violence
 congress ne satta main aane par AFSPA kii samiksha kaa chunavi ghoshnaa main vaada kiya he
 The BJP has raised serious questions on this, saying that the Congress party is making dangerous promises and its manifesto has such agendas that work to break the country
 haalanki 2014 main bijepi ne bhi AFSPA kii samiksha kaa aise hi vaada kiya tha
 PDP President Mehbooba Mufti said that we had an alliance with BJP in Jammu and Kashmir and a common minimum program was formed between the two parties, in which there was talk of reviewing AFSPA
 mahabuuba mufti ne mangalvaar ko twit kar kaha tha ki pidipi ne bijepi ke saath apane gathbandhan ke agenda main jis mudde ko shaamil kiya tha, uskaa samarthan karke congress ne bada saahas dikhaaya he
 This means that the promise that the Congress is making about the AFSPA is in the Lok Sabha elections this time
 bijepi use pehle hi kar chuki he
 Despite this, Union Minister and BJP leader Arun Jaitley said that the manifesto created by Rahul Gandhi's friends is not right about the security of Jammu and Kashmir and the nation
 is menifesto main aise agenda hai jo desh ko todane kaa kaam karte hai
 They go against the unity of the nation
 jo congress party or nehru gandhi parivaar ne jammu-kashmir ko lekar jo nirnay liya tha vah aitihaasik bhul thi
 The country can never forgive him for that
 us agendo ko or khatarnaak tareeke se aage badhaane kii taiyaari he
 Not only Arun Jaitley, BJP President Amit Shah also attacked the Congress about AFSPA and said that i want to ask the Congress chief
 kya vah sashastr balon ko majboot karnaa chaahate hai yaa kya vah unke manobal ko giraane kii koshish kar rahe hai? AFSPA par vah kya sandesh dena chaahate hai?chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main

 ) The new statement of Shivpal Yadav, who has been in constant controversy in the Samajwadi Party, may cause trouble for Akhilesh
 shivpal yadav ne jaswant nagar seat se namakan karne ke baad kaha tha ki ve 11 march ke baad nai party kaa gathan karenge
 However, Shivpal also said that at the moment they will contest the election on the cycle of the party's election trail but the decision will be taken after March 11
 mulaayam bhi hai naarajashivpal ke alaava akhilesh se in dinon mulaayam singh yadav bhi naaraaz chal rahe hai
 He too has refused to campaign in favor of the sp-congress alliance
 iske alaava mulaayam singh ne yah bhi kaha tha ki gathbandhan ke baad congress ko mili siton par sthaneey sapa netaa chunaav laden
 Most SP leaders of mulayam-shivpal's court have changed their party after the cut-off separatism
 sapa netaa ambika choudhary ne jo shuruyaat kii vah thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi
 Sharda Prasad Shukla has recently enrolled as an RLD candidate from his Sarojini Nagar seat
 sitapur ke dabang netaa rampal yadav, benny prasad ke bete rakesh verma, coed netaa mukhtaar ansari or unke bhai ke baad haal hi main shivpal ke kareebi naarad raay ne bhi sapa chhod di he
 Apart from this, there have been reports that Akhilesh was a minister in the cabinet and Shadab Fatima, a close friend of shivpal-mulayam, may also join the BSP, though he has not yet been confirmed to be a defection
 kya hoga asarmulaayam kii naaraazgi or shivpal ke ukhde bol se sabase bada nuksaan akhilesh ko hoga
 Akhilesh, who is working hard for the victory of sp-congress alliance, will also have to spend his energy in maintaining his family
 vahiin duusari ore sapa kaa paramparaagat voter jo ab tak mulaayam or shivpal ke kehane par vot detaa aayaa he, ek baar phir asamanjas kii sthiti main aa jayega
 Significantly, most of the SP voters and activists have an emotional relationship with Netaji

 In these assembly elections, the biggest challenge of the newly appointed National President of the SP will be to fight corruption
 thodaa sa vot shift de saktaa he bada jhatkaupi chunaavon main jeet kaa antar mahaj kuch pratishat vot share hi tay karata he
 In such a situation, the SP voters may be in a dilemma
 is baat ko aap pichley teen vidhansabha chunaavon ke aankadon se samaj sakate hai
 SP got a total of 29 in the 2012 assembly elections
 13% vot mili the jabaki duusare number par rahi bispi kaa mat pratishat 25
 Was 91%
 sapa ke khate main kul 224 siten mili thim jabaki bispi ko sirf 80 siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa tha
 a total of 30 to the BSP in the 2007 assembly elections
 43% vot mila tha jabaki duusare number par rahi sapa ko kul 25
 43% of the votes were received
 gauratlab he ki chunaav main sapa ne sirf 393 vidhansabha siton par chunaav ladaa tha jabaki bispi ne 403 siton par
 In the elections, BSP won 206 seats and SP won 97 seats
 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sapa ko kul 25
 37% of the votes were received while the BSP, which finished second, received 23 votes
 06% vot mili the
 Let us tell you that in these elections SP had contested 390 seats and won 143 seats while BSP contested 401 seats and won 98 seats
 muslim vot roak paanaa badi museebatmukhtaar ansaari sapa se alag ho chuke hai
 Akhilesh did not give ticket to Bahubali leader Atik Ahmed
 emelsi aashu malik kii suraksha main lagi jed security hatwa lee
 Now there are reports of Shadab Fatima leaving the party
 aise main muslim vot roak kar rakh paanaa sapa ke liye badi musiibat he
 Perhaps this is the reason why SP had to take the path of alliance with Congress
 gathbandhan kaa ho rahaa he phaaydataja opinian pole ke aankade dikhaate hai ki congress ke haath kaa saath samaajawaadee party kii cycle ko milane se samaajawaadee party ke voton main 7% voton kaa ijapha hua he
 According to opinion polls, SP has 26 per cent
 lekin congress ke saath gathbandhan hone ke baad is gathbandhan ko 33
 It is estimated to get 2% votes
 haalanki is nae gathbandhan se bijepi kaa apana vot share kamovesh aprabhavit he
 The fact is that bjp's own vote share, which was seen as 33% in December, increased to 34 in January
 8% ho gaya
 The election in UP is now broadly like a two-horse race between the BJP and the sp-congress alliance
 disambar main bijepi ko nikatatam pratidwandvi espi par 100 seat kii badhat hasil thi
 But now with akhilesh-rahul, they have completely changed the political equations of UP
 haalanki pradesh main congress haashie par pahunchi takat he lekin isane ek maheene ke antaraal main hi tathakthith dharmanirpeksh gathbandhan ke liye 76 siton kaa ijapha karne main madad kii he
 If the UP election is compared to horse racing, then in December the BJP horse was running somewhere ahead
 lekin janvari main isaki raftaar main kami aana shuru hua
 On the other hand, the sp's horse received a powerful dose from the Congress, so it started running at a faster pace than before
 agle kuch hafte ye tay karenge ki bijepi kaa ghoda apni badhat ko barkaraar rakhane main kaamyaab rahata he yaa phir aakhri strtch main pratidwandvi kii ore se pachhad diya jaataa he
 At the moment, the vote share difference between the two main rivals is 1

 Your Aadhaar number is slowly creating a financial link between you and the government

 In such a situation you will be responsible

 But the question is who is deciding the definition of wrong action? shiraj kuraishi kaa kahana he ki, "yogi ji se taqariban 35 minute tak unki batcheet hui jisamen yogi ji ne unhen bataaya ki ab tak unke paas koi bhi musalmaan jo ki meet ke kaarobaar se judaa he, koi shiqaayat lekar nahin aayaa he
 But now no action will be allowed against any person running the business legitimately
 shiraj kuraishi meet kaa kaam karne waalon ke rahanuma ke taur par buudhvaar ko siem yogi se mili jiske baad media ke zariye un logon ko aashwaasan dene kii koshish kii jo meet kaa kaarobaar karte hai
 He said that everything will be the same in the coming week
 tippaniyan Shiraz says, 'muslims have to change attitude towards BJP or Sangh
 logon ko jaakar apni baat rakhni hogi or unhen yogi or pradhanmantri modi donon se hi aashwaasan mila he ki unki har jagah sunwaayee hogi

 According to the Indian Meat Exporters, the state was affected by the ongoing instability around 11
 5 karod ke rajasav kaa nuksaan hoga
 Approximately 2
5 million people are directly or indirectly connected to the meat industry, of which about 30 per cent are from Uttar Pradesh
 lekin sawaal yahi he ki kya in mulaaqaaton se maahaul badalegaa? Shiraz Qureshi says, "he had a conversation with Yogi ji for about 35 minutes in which Yogi ji told him that till now he has not brought any complaint from any Muslim who is involved in the business of meat
 lekin ab kisi bhi vaid rup se kaarobaar chalaa rahe vyakti ke kilaaf koi karrwai nahin hone denge
 Shiraj Qureshi met CM Yogi on Wednesday as the leader of meat workers after which the media tried to give assurances to those who do meat business
 unhone kaha ki aane vaale ek hafte main sabakuch pehle jaisaa ho jayega
 The comments shiraj kaa kahana he, 'musalamaanon ko bijepi yaa sangh ke prati ravaiya badalanaa hoga
 People have to go and keep their point and they have got assurance from both Yogi and Prime Minister Modi that they will be heard everywhere

 Describing communalism as "more dangerous than corruption" at his residence, Bukhari told reporters, "the biggest question at this time is the unity, integrity and secularism of the country
" isliye meri hi nahin, karodon hindustani janata kii yah khwaahish he ki ek majboot raashtra kaa nirmaan ho jahaan bhrashtachar, sampradayikta or atyaachaar ke liye koi sthaan nahin ho
 After considering all the aspects, we have decided to support the Congress at the national level in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 ' Referring to the meeting with the Congress President, he said, "sonia Gandhi had a detailed discussion on issues like communal riots, implementation of the Sachar Committee and Ranganath Mishra Commission recommendations and protecting the life and property of Muslims
" ham isliye congress ko samarthan de rahe hai taaki aane vaale samay main vah apane vaadon ko puraa kare
 ' iske saath hi shahi imam ne mamata banerjee ke kaaryo kii tarif karte hue 'dharmanirpeksh logon se' pashchim bengal main congress kii bajaay 'sirf trinmul congress' kaa saath dene kii apil kii
 He said, 'west Bengal government has done some work to solve the problems of Muslims and it seems that Mamata Banerjee will work seriously in future also
 unhone yah bhi vaada kiya he ki vah bhavishya main rajg ke saath nahin jaaengi
 In such a situation, i have decided to support him
 ' Regarding the allegations of doing politics despite being a religious teacher, Shahi Imam said, 'india is a democratic country and every citizen has the right to speak here
 main ek naagarik kii haisiyat se apni raay rakh rahaa hum
 This is not a fatwa, but an appeal
 yah apil sirf musalamaanon se nahin, balki desh ke tamaam dharmanirpeksh logon se he ki ve desh ke dharmanirpeksh mulyon ko bachaane ke liye ekajute ho jaaen
 ' sapa, basapa or aam aadmi party par nishaanaa sadhate hue bukhari ne kaha, 'kuch tathakthith dharmanirpeksh dal dharmanirpeksh maton kaa bantwaaraa karne kii koshish main hai
 They are helping the communal forces from behind the scenes
 aise main hamaari koshish honi chahie ki kisi bhi surat main sampradayik maton kaa bantawara nahin ho
 ' unhone kaha, 'uttar pradesh main hamane mulaayam ke jubaani vaadon par sapa ko samarthan diya tha, lekin uttar pradesh kii sarkaar na sirf musalamaanon ko unka adhikaar dene main naakaam rahi, balki vah unki janmaal kii hifaazat bhi nahin kar pai

 is samiti kii siforeeshon ke aadhaar par bukhari ne congress kaa samarthan karne kaa elaan kiya
 Bukhari clarified that his support to the Congress is conditional
 unhone bihar ke sandarbh main kaha ki vahaan congress or lalu prasad kii rajd donon ko unka samarthan he
 In Bihar, both of them are contesting under the alliance
 pichley dinon congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se bukhari ne mulaakaat kii thi
 Sources in Jama Masjid said that during this meeting, Sonia insisted on not allowing secular votes to be divided
 is mulaakaat ko lekar narendra modi ne sonia gandhi par jamkar nishaan saadhaa tha
 In the context of bjp's complaint to the Election Commission about the meeting of Nia and Bukhari, Jama Masjid spokesperson Rahat Mehmood Chaudhary said, "the BJP should have also complained about Narendra Modi's presence on the platform which has Baba Ramdev's yoga
" do logon kii mulaakaat se aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kaise ho gaya
 ' shahi imam ne congress kaa samarthan kiye jane ke faisle kaa apane bhai saiyad yahaya bukhari dwaara khulkar virodh karne ke bare main puche jane par koi tippanee karne se inkaar kar diya

 The bugle of the UP assembly elections can be blown at any time
 chunaavon ke baad samaajawaadee party satta main rahegi yaa nahin, ye tay nahin he, lekin shivpal yadav ne apane putr aditya yadav kaa satta sukh agle paanch saal ke liye tay kar diya he
 Shivpal has crowned Aditya Yadav as the chairman of Uttar Pradesh State Cooperative Association for five years
 yani chunaav ke baad sapa bhale hi satta main rahe athwa na rahe, akhilesh yadav mukhyamantri rahen athwa na rahen lekin shivpal ke putr aditya yadav rajya kii is taqatvar post par kabiz rahenge
 According to party internal sources, Aditya oversees the assembly seat of his father Shivpal constituency Jaswant Nagar
 ve upi rajya sahakaari sangh ke adhyaksh pad se 2018 main ritair hone vaale the
 If the Samajwadi Party failed to return to power in the forthcoming assembly elections, it would not have been possible for Aditya to be re-crowned on this post, considered equivalent to a cabinet minister according to protocol
 sutara bataate hai ki shivpal ne isi ashanka se darkar aditya se is pad se samay se pehle istipha dilava diya or do din baad aam sahmati se unhen is pad par aane vaale paanch saal ke liye phir se chun liya

 Shivpal has ensured through this step that even though Akhilesh may not be the Chief Minister of UP for the next five years, Aditya will continue to hold this powerful post in the state
 aditya iffko or international kooparative alliance ke board main bhi diarector hai
 Meanwhile, Congress has called Shivpal's move a dirty game
 shahar congress cameti ke upaadhyaksh mohammad sharif ne kaha ki shivpal ne sabit kar diya he ki yadav parivaar satta main rahane ke liye gavarnence ke sabhi niyam tod saktaa he
 BJP also protested, BJP leader Raj Kumar Chahar said that this step of Shivpal is illegal and when BJP comes to power in 2017, it will take action in this matter
 unhone kaha ki samaajawaadee party sarkaar main apane hit saadhane ke liye har kadam uthaa rahi he lekin uskaa koi bhi kadam chunaav main uski haar nahin taal saktaa
 He said that it is very shameful that in a democracy, the Yadav family is behaving like kings and appointing their family members to important positions
 unhone kaha ki 2017 main yadav parivaar se satta chhin jaaegi or ye janata ke liye badi raahat sabit hogi
 How is Start-up India related to Make in India? Just as Make in India is from Indian farming or rural economy is from urban and industrial economy, as the market of auto, cement, food and consumer products sinks in the recession like today without the rural and urban demand
 bharat ke sabase zyada vailuation (shuddh kaarobaar kaa ausatan saat guna) vaale start-ap i commers se aate hai
 E-commerce is a small shopping mall for India's vast industry sector
 duusari taraf start-ap india ke graahak shahari kshetra se aate hai jahaan udyogon or inase judi sevaayen hi rojgaar kaa sabase bada strot hai
 On Sunday, when the Prime Minister was launching a campaign of subsidies for a new generation of small scale industries, start-ups, there was no doubt about the wisdom and courage of start-up entrepreneurs and the supply of financial needs
 sarkari start-ap fund kaa vichaar upajane (fund abhi dur he) se pehle is maheene tak pichley do saal main venture capital aadhaarit companiyon kii funding 12 arab dollar yani kareeb 80,000 karod rupye par pahunch gai
 According to start-up aggregator Taxcan, about 7
 3 arab dollar kii funding to 2015 main hui he
 So how the start-up will get the money is not a question, but the challenge is whether they will get the market or not
 agar menuphaccharing services main companiyon ne nivesh shuru nahin kiya to start-ap ke paas na maang hogi, na munafa or tab inke vailuation bulbule ban jaaenge jiskaa dar softbank ke president or sioo nikesh aroda ne start-ap india ke bhavy manch se jaahir bhi kiya
 For the success of Start-up India, the pair of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has to break the recession that is sitting on the balance sheet of companies
 pichley do saal main tamaam gambhir koshishon or usase gambhir prachaar ke baavjood arthvyavastha kii chunauti pichley 18 maah main zyada gaharaa gai he
 Industry, manufacturing and services are the biggest sources of employment in India but this front is collapsing sesame
 audyogic growth november main chaar saal ke sabase nichle str par aa gai he
 In the first two quarters of 2015-16, the earnings of companies decreased by 6 to 15 percent
 or yah giravat pichley do-teen saal se jari he
 Continuous exports are doubling difficulties
 mek in india kii koshishon or do bajaton ke baavjood modi sarkaar udyogon ko nae nivesh ke liye kyon raji nahin kar saki? bharat kaa udyog jagat ab us mandi se ghir gaya he jise takneekee jabaan main balance shit riseshan kehete hai
 It is different and complex from the old traditional recession
 yah mandi companiyon par laden karj se upajati he
 Most of the investment in the new economy is done by private companies
 balance shit riseshan ke dauraan companiyaan buree tarah karj main dab jaati hai isliye companiyaan jo bhi kamai karti hai, use karj chukaane main lagaati hai, na ki nae nivesh main
 In such a situation new investment ends
 global arthshaastri maanate hai ki japan kii 1990 se 2005 tak kii mandi darasal companiyon kii balance shit ko nichod dene vaale us karj se upji thi jo unhone bainkon se le rakhaa tha
 The recession between 2007 and 2009 in the US was also the balance sheet rationale
 karj ne bharat main companiyaan kii qamar tod di he
 According to an economic newspaper study, around 28 of the country's 441 major companies at the end of 2014-15
 5 lakh karod rupye ke karj par baithi thim jo desh kii kul 656 gaiyr vittiya companiyon ke karj kaa 98
 1 percent
 beete disambar main rigerv bank ke governor raghuram rajan ne companiyon ko nivesh kii raah main sabase badi musiibat yun hi nahin kaha tha
 The operating profits of companies are not sufficient to pay or repay interest on debt
 aisa dabaav mahasoos kar rahi companiyon kii sankhya 2009-10 main 16 thi jo teen saal pehle 29 or ab 67 ho gai he
 Similarly, the return on investment of companies also declined in 2014-15, the lowest level of the decade
 4 fisad par aa gaya he
 This is the balance sheet ration
 yaad kiijie, growth ke liye karj par byaaj daren ghataane kii vah bahes jo pichley saal khub chali or tab aisa lagata tha ki rigerv bank or vitt mantralay, donon do dhruvon par hai
 However, the Reserve Bank turned out to be right
 companiyon ke karj is kadar bad chuke hai ki ve jo kamai kar rahi hai, vah karj chukaane main ja rahi he
 On the other hand, banks are buried under a mountain of outstanding debts
 yahi vajah he ki byaaj dar main kami ke baavjood na nivesh badha, na growth
 With this, it was understood that the cure for this recession is not cheap loans only because the reason why companies will take medicines to increase the sick people
 agar vitt mantri is sach se ittefaq rakhte hai to is mandi kaa ilaaj bajet ko hi nikaalnaa hoga
 With the change of government, the sense of changing everything is coming to an end and the fact of declining industrial production, exports, agricultural produce, stock markets has come to light, then they will have to change the whole mathematics of the budget
 modi sarkaar ke pichley do bajaton main mandi khatm karne ko lekar badi nirnaayak ranneeti najar nahin ai
 Attempts to handle the deficit only by curbing spending and raising taxes were successful, but these budgets did not cure the lack of demand and the recession that has entered the balance sheets of companies
 aadhunik iconomi yani start-ap, puraani iconomi yani mek in india or kheti ab teenon sarkaar se mandi kaa ilaaj karne vaala dream bajet chaahate hai kya vitt mantri badi pariyojnaayen, kharch main tej badhotaree or taxon main kami de sakenge? agar yah saahas nahin dikhaa to vaastavik arthvyavastha kii dhalaan start-ap india ko badaae kii to chhodie, paanv tikaane kaa mauka bhi nahin degi
 The Uttar Pradesh government has ordered an inquiry into the stampede at Allahabad railway station on Sunday and asked the railways to make proper arrangements to facilitate the movement of pilgrims from across the country on the occasion of Maha Kumbh

 SP spokesman and state government minister Rajendra Chaudhary said that the state government has ordered an inquiry into the incident
 kumbh main snaan bina kisi samasya ke sampann ho gaya
 The unfortunate incident happened at the railway station

 Sambhal, considered a stronghold of the Samajwadi Party, will be seen by all in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 muslim bahul ilaaka hone ke baavjood 2014 ke chunaav main is seat par bhartiya janata party ne jeet darj kii thi, jise samaajawaadee party ke liye ek bada jhatka mana gaya
 bjp's Satyapal Saini came from here winning the election
 is seat se samaajawaadee party ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav or diggaj netaa professor ramgopal yadav bhi saansad chune ja chuke hai
 History of Sambhal Lok Sabha seat General seat Sambhal came into existence in 1977, elections were being held for the first time in the country after Emergency, Charan Singh's party won from here
 uske baad 1980, 1984 main lagaataar congress phir 1989, 1991 main janata dal ne ye seat jiti
 In 1996, Bahubali DP Yadav held this seat on Bahujan Samaj Party ticket
 1998 main ye seat viipi siton kii ginati main aa gai, tatkaaleen samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne 1998, 1999 main yahaan se chunaav jeeta
 In 2004, his brother Professor Ram Gopal Yadav was elected as an MP
 lekin 2009 main ye seat bahujan samaaj party ke khate main gai
 The equation of Sambhal Lok Sabha seat is also dominated by Muslim voters in Sambhal Lok Sabha adjoining seats like Rampur, Amroha and Moradabad
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki bhartiya janata party ke liye ye seat mushkil maani jaati thi
 But in 2014, BJP won here

 It has around 40 percent Hindu population and more than 50 percent Muslim population
 sanbhal loksabhaa ke antargat kul 5 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 These include Kundarki, Bilari, Chandausi, Asmoli and Sambhal
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sirf chandausi vidhansabha hi bhartiya janata party ke khate main gai thi, jabaki anya sabhi siton par samaajawaadee party kaa kabja rahaa
 a few votes were won by the bjp's Satyapalamuslim-dominated seat in 2014, which was very thorny
 bhartiya janata party ke satyapal saini or samaajawaadee party ke shafiq ur rahamaan bark ke bich jeet-haar main sirf 5000 voton kaa antar tha
 Such a difference in the Lok Sabha is considered minor
 vahiin bahujan samaaj party ke akil ur rahamaan khan tisare number par rahe the
 Political pundits believed that Muslim votes were divided here between SP and BSP, which is why BJP benefited and won
 2014 loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejeysatypal saini, bhartiya janata party, kul vot mili 360,242, 34
 1% Shafiq ur Rehman Burke, Samajwadi Party, Total votes were 355,068, 33

W
 chidambaram bijepi ke har tabake se beemaa bill ko paarit karwaane main sahyog kii apil karte phir rahe the
 But he had to face obstacles at every step
 ab badali paristhiti main bejaar congress sansad kii vipakshi bench par baithi he or satta par virajman bijepi beemaa kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) badhwane ke liye usee tarah vidhaayi samarthan kii khatir vipaksh kii chirori kar rahi he
 The impact of changing the idea of the chair, its example is clear about this bill
 jahaan ek saal pehle bijepi bhartiya shairdharakon kii khatir pukhta niyantran sunishchit kiye jane ke praavdhaanon kii vakaalat kar rahi thi, vahiin ab congress epadi ke tahat videshi sansthagat niveshkon (exiai) se puunji jutaaye jane ke virodh main he
 This is a great example of protest politics for protest
 lekin congress ke liye shaayad yah usase kuch zyada he
 It is also related to the desperation of losing relevance in Parliament where its strength in the Rajya Sabha has become important only
 haalanki praasangik bane rahane ke bhi alag-alag arth hote hai jo satta ke makasad par nirbhar karte hai
 It was here that Ghulam Nabi Azad, the leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, found that he faced a tough challenge
 jahaan yah saaf tha ki congress is bill ke mudde par sarkaar ko chaiyn se nahin baithne degi
 Congress leaders say that the party's opposition on this issue is to the extent of bringing the House to a standstill
 yahaan do tarah ke kadam uthaane kii sambhaavnaaen ubharin-pehali to yah ki sarkaar ko bill main epadi kii paribhaasha main sanshodhan ke liye majaboor kiya jaae or duusari jab tak sambhav ho, rajyasabha kii kaarywahi thap karaae rakhi jaae
 Many former ministers like Chidambaram, Anand Sharma and senior leaders like Digvijay Singh are told that they are willing to try these options to convey the message that the Congress too has the ability to bow down to the government on an important issue
 duusari sambhaavna, jise congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa samarthan hasil bataaya ja rahaa he or vah yah he ki tab tak koi samjhauta na kiya jaae jab tak koi siyaasi keemat na vasuul lee jaae
 Those supporting this view include Madhusudan Mistry and Ambika Soni
 isliye jab kaaryamantranaa samiti (birsi) kii baithak main trinmul congress, sipiem or eidmke ne ek pravar samiti (select cameti) gathit kiye jane kaa suzav diya to aaazaad ne maukey kaa phayda uthaane main deree nahin kii
 It is said that he later convened a secret meeting of the major opposition parties and got the consent of all on the proposal to set up a senior committee consisting of 11 members in his name

 maitreyan jayalalita kii rajamandi lekar aae or prastaav main apana naam shaamil karaane ke liye ek sanshodhan pesh kiya
 Now the latest situation is that despite being two times back and forth, the government cannot ask the President to call a joint session unless there is a disagreement between the two houses
 is maamle main yah vidheyak 2008 main rajyasabha main pesh kiya gaya tha or abhi tak vahaan se baahar hi nahin aa paaya he
 It is clear that Congress has got a good chance to play bjp's bets with BJP itself
 sawaal yah he ki congress is bill par samarthan ke badale koun-si siyaasi keemat vasuulana chaahati he? rajnatik galiyare main chal rahi charchaa kii maane to yah neshnal herald maamle main koi raahat ho sakati he
 On August 5, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley fueled the speculation by saying that the matter could end if the Congress repaid the debt
 saaf he ki isamen kisi bhi tarah praasangik bane dikhne kii congress kii badi manshaa to maujuud hi he, bijepi ke liye bhi sandesh he ki yadi sarkaar haath nahin badhaati he to congress pradhanmantri narendra modi ke aarthik agenda ke raste main rukaawatein daal sakati he
 The Congress has stepped in to make its voice heard
 yah rasta apanaate hue congress ne sanket de die hai ki bhale use koi bhi samjhauta abhi karnaa pade yaa phir pradhanmantri ke america daure ke baad sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main, lekin vah sarkaar ko apni ahmiyat kam karke aankane nahin degi
 The Congress is also ready to reverse its stand of the UPA Raj for this
 is vivaad se nikalne kaa rasta talashne kii jimmedaari ab sarkaar kii he
 At the moment, he is not in a soft mood
 vah rajyasabha main vidheyak ko khaarij karaane kaa jokhim uthaakar ek aisi prakriya shuru karvaa sakati he jisase aakhirkaar sanyukt satr bulaane kaa maarg prashast ho jaae
 At the same time, it is also exploring the possibility of reviving some regional parties in its court
 baharhaal jo bhi ho, kuch-na-kuch to ganvaana hi hoga
 Although Delhi is getting cold, the electoral atmosphere is hot
 vaise to dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii tarikhon kaa elaan abhi nahin hua he, lekin sabhi dal jor-shor se prachaar main lage hai
 Whether it is Congress or AAP and BJP, all parties are preparing with full enthusiasm
 aise main aaj tak ne jaananaa chaha ki 'dilli ke dil main kya he?'ajtak ke kaarykram 'dilli ke dil main kya he?' bijepi kii ore se vijay goyal, aap kii ore se ashish khetaan or congress kaa paksh mahabal mishra ne rakhaa
 'in the heart of Delhi' Vijay Goel said that we will give such a government in Delhi which will not stage picket, will develop
 duusari ore ashish khetaan ne kaha ki hamaari sabhaaon main bheed rahati he
 We do what we say
 ham bijepi kii tarah badalte nahin hai, jo chunaav se pehle kahati he ki mahilaon ko suraksha denge or baad main ladakiyon ke genes pahanane par sawaal khadey karti he
 BJP used to talk against corruption before the election and is now converting
 (bijepi-aap samarthak, kai aspataal main bhartee)vahiin, congress netaa mahabal mishra ne kaledhan kaa mudda uthaaya
 He said that we have developed, brought the metro
 coloniyon ko niyamit karne kaa kaam congress ne kiya tha
 We are not afraid
 bijepi or aam aadmi party donon par hamale kiye
 What's in the heart of Delhi? In the program, issues like full state, women safety, pollution, regularization of colonies have been mainly raised by the public
 inamen kai muddon par bijepi fansati dikhaai di to kai par aap
 In Delhi, the people of Delhi, including the BJP and the Congress, took a sharp dig at Kejriwal's sit-in protest when he questioned the public for not taking down the CM candidate
 iske alaava rahul gandhi or sonia gandhi ke mudde par congress netaa mahabal mishra bhi gol-mol jawaab dete najar aae
 In Bihar, the bjp-led NDA consists of four parties
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle siton ke bantwaare ko lekar in sabhi dalon ke bich ghamaasan machaa hua he
 The state has a total of 40 parliamentary seats
 aise main bijepi, jediu,algepiauraraspike bich siton ke sateek formule par manthan chal rahaa he, lekin abhi tak in dalon ke bich aapasi sahmati kaa sahi rasta nikalataa najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Let me tell you that in July 2017 last year, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made a comeback to bjp-led NDA by breaking ties with RJD
 jediuke aane ke baad se endie ke baaki teenon dalon ke bich seat ko lekar talmail nahin ban paa rahi he
 According to the report of the English newspaper Economics Times, four seat sharing formulas have been suggested between the NDA allies in the state
 formula number vanbijepi endie main sahyogi dalon ke bich samaadhaan ke liye alag-alag formule par kaam kar rahi he
 In such a situation, the first way is that the BJP can leave two out of its 21 seats won, but 1 rebel MP of RLSP is with BJP
 is tarah bijepi 20, algepi 6 or araspi ko 2 siten mil sakati hai
 In this way, the remaining 12 seats will come to jdu's account
 haalanki is formule par jediu kaa taiyaar hona mushkil he, kyonki bihar main nitish kumaar ko bade bhai kii bhoomika kii baat unki party kah chuki he
 In such a situation, he is expecting the maximum seats in the NDA
 formula number toubihaar bijepi jediu kaa saath kisi bhi surat main chhodana nahin chaahati he
 In such a situation, the second way in front of the BJP is to leave 4 seats won
 is tarah se bijepi 18 seat par chunaav lade
 JDU 14, LJP 6 and RLSP 2 can get seats
 is tareeke se siton ke bantwaare par bhale hi jediu maan jaae, lekin araspi taiyaar ho ye mushkil hai, kyonki 2014 main uske khate main 3 siten ai thim
 Looking at the formula number 3rlsp's tone, it seems that she may be out of the NDA
 aise halaat banate hai to bijepi 20
 JDU 14 and LJP 6 seats may come to account
 ye formula aisa he jis par sabhi sahamat ho sakate hai, kyonki nitish kumaar ke ramvilas paswan se achche sambandh hai
 Dealing with RLSP will not be an easy task for the BJP, which wants more seats in the Lok Sabha
 formula number forendie ke sahyogi dalon ke bich seat bantwaare kaa chauthaa formula aisa he jiske tahat bijepi or jediu rajya 20-20 loksabhaa siten baant len
 After this, BJP give seats to RLSP from its account and JDU give seats to LJP from its account seats
 is tarah donon bade dal apane chote sahyogi dalon ke saath sahmati banaae

 Vinod Roy is being called to testify on the CAG report on the damage caused by the allocation of 2G spectrum licenses
 piesi ke adhyaksh murali manohar joshi kaa kahana he ki sieji vinod raay ne unhen khat likhakar kaha he ki wo apni marzi se piesi ke saamne pesh hone ko taiyaar hai
 On the other hand, BJP is also demanding to call HRD Minister Kapil Sibal for testimony
 kyonki unhone sieji kii report ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki 2 ji ghotaale main koi nuksaan nahin hua tha
 jaish-e-mohammed, a terrorist organization responsible for the Pulwama attack, is also at the behest of neighboring Pakistan
 bharat ke khilaaf sajeesh rachane vaale uske jaise kai aatanki sanghathan aatankistan ban chuke pakistan kii panaah main he
 The ringleaders of those terrorist organizations sit there and ignite fire against India all the time
 khuleam bharat ko dhamkee dete hai
 There are three such terrorists, who are today India's biggest enemies
 in teen aatankiyon kaa khaatmaa bahut zaruri he
 Let us tell you about the dark misdeeds of these three enemies of India
 dushman number 1 masood ajharbahawalpur main madrason ke naam par hindustan kaa dushman number ek yani masood azhar pakistan se dehshatgardi kii dukaan chalaa rahaa he
 Jambaz commandos of the Indian Army had shown just a little trailer that the enemies of India sitting in Pakistan lost their sweat
 masood ajahar bhi sargical strike ke baad nae thikaane par rahane laga he
 According to sources, now both Hafiz Saeed and Masood have moved away from their madrassas and the organization's headquarters to live among the densely populated with a few select operatives
 iske peeche unki soch ye he ki ghani aabaadi ke bich rahanaa zyada mahfuj he
 The government is exploring new ways on this issue with China's continuing veto over attempts to ban Masood Azhar, the mastermind of the Pathankot attack and the mastermind of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 bharat ke paas pathankot hamale kaa badla lene or jaish-e-mohammad jaise aatanki sanghathan par lagaam lagane ke liye sargical strike kaa opshan jarur maujuud he
 Recently, the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammad has claimed responsibility for the CRPF convoy attack in Pulwama
 dushman number 2 haafiz saidathik isi tarah haafiz said bhi pakistan ke hi mureed ke ilaake main rah kar alag-alag naamon se dehshat kii dukaan chalaata he
 Hafiz Saeed keeps changing his whereabouts
 wo apni jaan bachaane ke liye ghani bastiyon main logon ke bich jaakar chup jaataa he
 The effect of India's surgical strike and international pressure is that Pakistan no longer supports Hafiz Saeed openly
 pakistan ne duniya ko dikhaane ke liye hafiz said kii najarbandi bhi kii thi
 Pak says its activities were a threat to peace in the country
 hafiz said ke saath punjab grih vibhaag ne uske chaar saathi abdulla ubeda, malik jafar ikbaal, abdul rahamaan aabid or kaaji kashif hossain ko bhi najarband kiya tha
 Significantly, jamaat-ud-dawa, the organization of Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai terror attack, is independent in Pakistan
 usne vahaan chunaav bhi ladaa tha lekin wo buree tarah se haar gaya tha
 Enemy number 3 Syed Salahuddin Syed Mohammad Yusuf Shah is known as Syed Salahuddin
 uskaa makasad kashmir ko aaazaad karana he
 Salauddin had threatened last year that he would make Jammu and Kashmir a cemetery for Indian soldiers
 bharat pichley kuch samay se ise antarrashtriya aatankwaadi ghoshit karaane main juta tha
 Her father worked in the Indian Postal Department
 apane apane parivaar main saatvin santan he
 He first studied medicine but wanted to go into the civil service
 baad main uskaa rujhaan jamaat-e-islamic sanghathan kii taraf ho gaya or vah us sanghathan ke liye kashmir main kaam karne laga
 In 1987, he contested from the Amirakdal Legislative Assembly seat of Srinagar
 lekin matganana ke dauraan vah jeet rahaa tha lekin usee vakt us par booth capcharing ke aarope lage or use giraftaar kar liya gaya
 After he was arrested there was a lot of uproar
 uske baad salahuddin ko dhamkiyaan die jane kii baat saamne ai
 But after coming out of jail, he declared that it would be right to use gun to liberate Kashmir
 iske baad salahuddin ne hijb-ul-mujahidin kii sadsyta le lee
 He then got in touch with ISI
 paak khufia agency ke ishaare par hi wo sanghathan kaa mukhiya ban baitha
 Since then, he keeps plotting against India
 enie ne use most wonted ghoshit kar rakhaa he
 After entering the house after the Pulwama attack, the people of India want these terrorists to enter and kill the house in the same way as Osama bin Laden was killed by the American Navy Seal
 desh kii janata ko intjaar he ki kab hindustan bhi aisa hi oparation anjaam degaa or nishane par koi or nahin balki honge hindustan ke dushman number ek, do or teen honge
 By the way, these three have already been on the radar of Indian agencies
 lekin pulavama hamale ke baad sarkaar or sena inke khilaaf badi karrwai kii yojana bana sakati he
 a report by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) warns that the opposition to various development projects by various ngos (ngos), including Greenpeace, will have a negative impact on the country's economic growth rate
 aarthik vruddhi par yah nakaaratmak asar do se teen pratishat ho saktaa he
 The IB has concluded this in its report 'the impact of ngos on development'
 ibi kii is report main daawa kiya gaya he ki enjio or unke antarrashtriya daandaata ab kai nai aarthik vikaas yojanaon ko nishaanaa banane kii yojana bana rahe hai, jinamein gujarat kii yojanaayen bhi shaamil hai
 a copy of this report has been sent to the Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Home Affairs, National Security Advisor, Finance Minister and others
 isamen aarope lagaaya gaya he ki ye enjio parmaanu urja sanyantron, uranium khaanon, koyale se chalane vaale bijligharon tathaa panbizli pariyojnaon ke khilaaf pradarshan ke saath saath vikaas yojanaon ko rokane ke liye kaam karte hai
 On the other hand, Greenpeace has dismissed this allegation saying, 'we believe that this IB report has been designed to silence the society against the injustice of the people by asking tough questions about the current model of development

 dopahiyaa vaahan chalaate samay maharashtra sarkaar ne helmet pahananaa anivaary kya kiya log iske virodh main sadakon par aa gaye
 Shiv Sainiks even took a helmet trip and cremated the funeral procession by creating a 'helmet Strictly anti-kriti Samiti'
 saath hi sarkaar ke khilaaf narebaaji bhi kii
 In fact, after 184 deaths in Pune last year, the administration took strict action against wearing a helmet while driving a two-wheeler and made it mandatory
 iske virodh main shivasena netaa mahadev babai ne police prashasan par aarope lagaaya ki ham road sefti ke khilaaf nahin he
 But the strict police administration is implementing it is wrong
 netaaon kaa tark - helmet pahanane se log ganje ho rahe hai
 
 
 At the same time, the logic of Balasaheb Runwal, who is leading this brigade, is peculiar
 unka kahana he ki helmet itnaa baari hota he ki isse bikers ko ridh or gardan main dard hota he or bal bhi jhadate hai
 So wearing a helmet should not be mandatory
 saansad bhi helmet ke khilaaf
 
 
 
 pune se saansad anil shirole kehete hai ki public sefti jaruri he, lekin local road par log itani tej gaadiyaan nahin chalaate hai
 Accident happens on big roads
 isliye har jagah helmet pahananaa anivaary nahin hona chahie
 NCP spokesperson Ankush Kakade says that instead of putting a fine on people, they should be left with advice
 itani zyada sakhti logon par sahi nahin he
 At the same time, people on social media strongly opposed this incident
 unka kahana he ki aane vaale dinon main loksabhaa chunaav hai isliye netaa publicity stant kar rahe hai
 The Motor Vehicle Act 1988 requires wearing a helmet
 
 
 gauratlab he ki motor whical act 1988 ke anusaar, dopahiyaa vaahan chaalkon ko helmet pahananaa anivaary he
 But despite the administration's repeated assertions, people do not wear helmets
 nunatam aay yojana (nyaay) par tippanee maamle main niti ayog ke upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ke dwaara daakhil jawaab se chunaav ayog asantusht he
 The Election Commission has considered Rajiv Kumar's statement and tweet on the justice scheme as a violation of the code of conduct
 rajeev kumaar ke jawaab se asantusht nirvachan ayog ne unhen bhavishya main saavdhaan rahane kii chetavanee di
 The Election Commission believes that anyone should stay away from electoral politics after becoming part of the executive
 ayog ke notice par kuch or mohalat lekar rajeev kumaar ne jawaab daakhil kar safai to pesh kii lekin ayog santusht nahin hua
 Finally, the Election Commission has instructed Kumar to be careful in future
 rajeev ne EC ko diya tha ye jawabaisase pehle ‘nyaay’ yojana par tippanee maamle main upaadhyaksh rajeev kumaar ne apana jawaab ellection kamishan ko de diya tha, jisamen rajeev kumaar ne kaha ki unki tippanee sirf ek arthshaastri ke taur par thi, vah nijee thi isliye use niti ayog kaa vichaar naa maane
 What was Rajiv's tweet on 'nyaya'? When the Congress party announced the 'nyaya' scheme in the midst of the political summer of Lok Sabha elections, Rajiv Kumar made a comment about it on his Twitter account
 unhone twit kiya tha ki nyaay yojana to chand laakar dene jaisaa vaada he
 This impractical scheme will collapse the country's economy
 sarkari khajaane ko jo ghaataa hoga, use puraa nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Several opposition parties had raised objection to this tweet by Rajiv Kumar and complained to the Election Commission
 jiske baad ayog ne unhen notice jari karte hue jawaab maanga tha
 What is the minimum income scheme? Rahul Gandhi has promised that if his party comes to power, it will give financial assistance of 72 thousand rupees annually to 20 percent of the poor of the country

 Applying this scheme can cost about Rs 3 lakh 60 thousand crore

 Rubbish is taught in schools
 Zaidi said - Pakistan actually came into existence on August 14, 1947
 phir schuli pathyapustak kaa ansh padhate hue bole- kitaab main daawa kiya gaya he ki yah 712 isvi main astitv main aayaa, jab arab sindh or multan aae the
 This is utter nonsense
 steshnon par ab mahila kuliyon ko dekhne ke baad chaunke nahin, bhartiya rail ne ek nayi pahal karte hue steshnon par mahila kuli kii tainaati kaa faisla kiya he tathaa mahilaon ne isse sambandhit parikshaayen bhi uteern kii hai
 Rajesh Dutt Vajpayee, chief public relations officer of North Central Railway, said, "A total of 19 women had appeared in the physical endurance test
 ’’ unhone bataaya ki railway board ne pehali baar kuliyon kii bhartee ke liye sanshodhit disha nirdesh jari kiya he tathaa iske tahat mahilaayein bhi is pad ke liye purushon ke saath uteern hui hai
 Vajpayee said that a total of 344 posts of porter in the NCR region are vacant
 iske liye 27 mahilaon samet 4800 logon ne aavedan kiya tha
 After initial screening, including physical health check-up, 19 women were declared qualified for physical endurance examination
 unhone bataaya ki ensiaar kshetra main elahabaad, kanpur, aligarh or vindhyachal jaise kai vyastatam or mahatvapurn railway stesan hai, jo ki bhartiya rail ke kul yatriyon kaa kareeb 15 fisadi he
 He said that in the physical endurance examination, female candidates had to lift 200 kilograms and cover a distance of 200 meters in four minutes
 pariksha main purushon or mahilon ke liye bhaar or duuri to ek samaan tha lekin mahilon ko purushon se ek minute kaa adhik samay diya gaya tha

 (input bhashaa se) On the issue of power cut in Delhi, CM Arvind Kejriwal has threatened the power companies in the typical way
 unhone janata se kaha ki vah chintaa na kare, sarkaar bijli companiyon ko na danda main kami ho rahi he or na hi danda kii sies main
 While former CM Sheila Dikshit condemned the statement, such a language does not suit a Chief Minister
 shanivaar ko bijli kii samasya par janata se mukhaatib kejariwal ne kaha, 'aap chintaa na karen, ham bijli kii companiyon ko danda karne main koi kami nahin kar rahe hai
 There is no shortage in poles and no poles
 ' haalanki unke is bayaan or isamen istemaal bhashaa vivaadaaspad bhi maani ja rahi he
 Power does not come from the poles: On the other hand, former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said that the kind of language that Kejriwal is using for power companies does not suit a Chief Minister
 shila ne aage kaha ki danda ke jor par bijli nahin aati
 Earlier these companies used to provide electricity

 The government has told them that electricity should be fixed within two hours, otherwise compensation will have to be paid
 unhone kaha ki dilli kii janata ko bheeshan garmi kii vajah se bijli adhik chahie
 Excerpts from CM Arvind Kejriwal's statement - We have given policy directions to DERC which is a power to the Delhi government under the law
 - kisi bhi ilaake main aghoshit bijli katautee hoti he, aandhi aa jaati he to alag baat he, lekin aghoshit bijli katautee ko do ghante main thik karnaa hoga
 Otherwise people will have to pay compensation
 - DERC se baat kii he ye policy jald hi lagu hone vaali he taaki inaki javabdehi tay ho sake
 - Why did you privatize in Delhi 15 years ago
 kyonki dilli main bijli vyavastha sudhare, na ki har saal bijli ke daam bade
 - We did not allow electricity rates to increase inside Delhi after coming to government
 - javabdehi tay karne kii jarurat he, ye log kah dete hai ki local folt ho gaya
 In engineering, what should be the fault? - i am picking up the phone of people complaining every night
 - danda dikhaa rahe hai ham, chintaa mat karo
 There is no shortage of poles, nor is there any shortage of poles

 Often the charismatic chief with wide public support becomes a symbol of the dynasty and if he is martyred, it enables his descendant to satisfy the popular tendency to 'take revenge by bringing a man of descent into power' can do

 Gandhi and Jinnah, the two Gujarati 'founders' of India and Pakistan, apparently died without a heir
 donon shahid the
 Some say that Jinnah deteriorated on the way when he was being brought back from a health resort in Balochistan to Karachi in a dilapidated Red Cross vehicle, and he was 'left to die on the road'
 ' unke bharosemand pradhanmantri liyakat ali khan par ungali uthaai jaati he
 Unlike Gandhi, whose family did not take interest in carrying on the tradition of charisma, Jinnah's sister Fatima plunged into politics, but was suppressed by military dictator General Ayub Khan
 is baat ke majboot sakshya hai ki unki hatya kii gai thi
 Sharifuddin Pirzada, the former Attorney General of Pakistan and Honorary Secretary to Jinnah from 1941 to 1944, revealed that Fatima Jinnah did not die naturally in 1967, but was murdered by one of her servants
 pakistan ke videsh sachiv shehryaar khan kii maa ne apane sansmaran aabida sultanh memoyrs of a rable princej (oupi 2003) main likhaa haih ''maine miss jinna ko barf kii silliyon ke bich lete hue paaya
 Blue stains were visible on his face, especially below the left eye
 unako dhakne vaali chadar main bhi kuch khun laga hua tha lekin main yah nahin pakad pai ki yah kaan se nikal rahaa tha yaa naak yaa munh se
 So what is the precondition of martyrdom dynasty? Jinnah's dynasty came to an end as his daughter Diana decided to marry in India and he liked the Zoroastrian religion
 pakistan kii vansh parampara vyavastha main gaiyr-musalamaanon ko jagah nahin milti
 But the next charismatic leader Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto left a 'transferable' family pride in 1979 by his martyrdom
 unki maut ko aaj desh 'nyaayik hatya' ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Under the military dictatorship, the Supreme Court of Pakistan had become 'a party' against him
 maikiyavali se behatar is karishme ko or koun bayaan kar saktaa he
 In his book Handhins, he suggested that the best recipe for attaining the crown is based on three rules: First: be anxious for 'good luck', which means to be present in every occasion, and second: you have 'qualities'
 To be gifted, which means take recourse to opportunism; Third: Connect with the interests of the common man

 Like the Nehru dynasty of India, there were two martyrs in the Bhutto dynasty that shook Pakistan
 benazir bhutto ke bete bilaval bhutto ke mutabik al 
 Qaeda killed her mother in 2007, along with several Pakistani ISI officials
 sahi baat to yah he ki 'bade hone ke hisaab se bhutto kaa taj unke bade bete mir murtaja bhutto ko miltaa, jinaki 1996 main karachi main goli markar hatya kar di gai
 The anti-bhutto people of Punjab say that it was Prime Minister Benazir who got them 'murdered'

 Bilawal's father Asif Ali Zardari has maintained his influence by making him the co-chairman of the Pakistan People's Party

 It is possible that Nniganwa will one day rule behind the scenes like Sonia Gandhi, born in Italy and living in India

 In developing democracies, it depends on many factors: lack of awareness among the voting public, drawing poverty-stricken masses from Machiavelli's hidden message of 'taking the side of the common man', by 'preparing' leaders in dynastic families
 His ability to be able, to suffer like a martyr, to invest money in political campaigns and to make personal sacrifices when in opposition

 Nawaz Sharif is the head of the Pakistan Muslim League who is handing over a dynastic legacy to his descendants in order to 'prepare' them to maintain the Sharif dynasty

 The ANP first confined itself within the province, but was forced to become 'national' when Karachi emerged as the world's largest Pashtun city in the south

 The importance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) can be understood from its place in Indian energy security
 yuai 2014-15 main bharat ko kachche tel kaa chatha sabase bada niryaatak desh rahaa he
 Earlier in 1981, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited this country

 Sources in the Ministry of External Affairs said that the main thrust in Modi's visit is to attract investment from the uae's sovereign wealth fund, which according to the UAE is more than $ 800 billion

 The Supreme Court has given a historic verdict after which it will be difficult for tainted leaders to contest elections
 adaalat ne faisalaa diya he ki jin netaaon ko 2 saal yaa usase adhik kii sazaa sunai jaaegi, uski sadsyta tatkaal radd ho jaaegi
 Yes, if the decision of the Supreme Court comes in their favor, then their membership will be automatically withdrawn

 Because they will not have the right to enroll after going to jail

 The Supreme Court has abolished Section 8 (4) of the Representation of the People Act, which provides protection to the public representatives
 iske tahat sazaa ke baad apil lambit hone tak pad par bane rahane kaa praavdhaan tha
 However, the court has given relief that this decision will not be applicable to those already convicted public representatives who have filed appeals against the verdict

 Significantly, there has been a demand for the removal of 'tainted' leaders with criminal records from the system of governance

 England's newspapers have strongly criticized Team India's embarrassing defeat in the fifth and final Test
 bhartiya team ravivaar ko england se antim test ek pari or 244 ran se haar gai
 With this, a new link was added to India's poor performance on Sunday when the team suffered its biggest defeat in the last 40 years
 team sirf teen din ke bheetar hi haar gai jisase england ne siries 3-1 se jeet lee
 Geoffrey Boycott wrote in his column in the Daily Telegraph, 'indian batsmen were like lambs who arrived for slaughter
 bhartiya ballebaajon ne ek baar phir lachar pradarshan kiya or puri team sirf 29
 Piled on 94 runs in 2 overs
 unke ballebaajon main james anderson or stuart broad jaise duniya ke do sarvshereshth test gendbaajon kaa saamana karne ke liye jazbe or takneekee kii kami thi
 On such pitches they can stack any batsman and these talented boys (indian batsmen) had no experience of playing in these conditions
 ’unhone likhaa, ‘bharat ko jab old traverd or da ovel ke seem or swing kii anukool pichon par ballebaaji or gendbaaji karne ko kaha gaya to unhone behad kharaab pradarshan kiya
 The Independent said, "the reputation of Indian batsmen has suffered and Virat Kohli has suffered a little more

 He was just 13 in the series
 40 ke ausat se ran bana paaya
 He was only 22 runs more than James Anderson who played five innings less than him
 ab usne koi nayaa (sachin) tendulkar nahin kah rahaa
 It is not a whitewash like the 0–4 defeat on the last tour of 2011, but with the Southampton Test, India's problems continued to grow and the team was constantly embarrassed
 ’bibisi ne kaha, ‘log antim do test main balle se bharat ke lachar prayaas ke bare main baat karenge lekin isse england kii uplabdhiyon kii andekhi nahin kerani chahie
 England has put India in such a situation and when you get on the field as a team, you have to show ruthlessness

 And the credit does not go to anyone else but to Viagra, a drug that enhances sex power
 bachche kii maa ke mutabik, 'reuben ko pulmonary hisertension he
 Viagra helps in widening of blood vessels going towards the lungs and it helps in the flow of blood properly
 'unhone kaha, 'vah ek din main viagara kii chaar goliyaan khaataa he
 If he does not eat medicine, then his lungs will work properly and his body will not get enough oxygen
 'jab vah 20 hafton kii garbhvatee thim tab unhen doctor ne bataa diya tha ki unke bachche ko janmajaat hernia he
 She did not want to castrate the child because she had lost one of her children a year earlier

 the government grain sharing system in the country
 kuch jaankaar isse mahangaai badhane kaa andeshaa bhi jataa rahe hai to kuch kah rahe hai ki sarkaar anaaj kharid main dhilaai bartegi, jisase kisaanon kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The question is also why the government is talking of cash subsidy instead of food security bill just before the elections
 purv videshmantri natwar singh dwaara apni pustak main kii gai tippanee ke jawaab main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne kaha he ki vah khud bhi ek kitaab likhengi, jisase sab sach jaan sakenge
 During a special conversation with NDTV, Sonia Gandhi said, "I will write the book myself, and then every person will know the truth
 
 
 main ise (kitaab likhane ko) lekar gambhir hum, or main likhuungi
 
 
 " ullekhneey he ki purv videshmantri natwar singh ne buudhvaar ko daawa kiya tha ki varsh 2004 main sonia gandhi ne 'antaratma kii aawaaj sunakar' nahin, balki apane bete rahul gandhi ke kade etraj ke baad pradhanmantri banane se inkaar kiya tha
 According to Natwar Singh, Rahul Gandhi did this because he feared that if Sonia would accept the post of Prime Minister, she could be murdered like her father and grandmother
 vaise, ek samay gandhi parivaar ke dost maane jane vaale 83-varshiya natwar singh ne varsh 2008 main, yani upie-1 ke dauraan iraq ke anaaj ke badale tel ghotaale kii prishthbhumi main congress chhod di thi
 On these allegations, Sonia Gandhi said, "I no longer have any trouble with such allegations, because i have seen my mother-in-law's body riddled with bullets, i have seen the body of my husband
 
 
 main is tarah kii baton se dukhi hone se upar uth chuki hum
 
 
 " natwar singh ke bare main baat karne par congress adhyaksh kaa kahana tha, "unhen jo kahana-karnaa he, ve karte rahen, mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 
 
 If they get pleasure from these works, then they can keep doing it
 
 
 lekin mujhe inase koi takalif nahin hoti, kyonki mujhe in sabaki aadat pad chuki he
 
 
 " purv congressi netaa natwar singh kii tippanee par manmohan singh ne kaha, maine sonia gandhi ko koi file nahin dikhaai, nijee baatcheet saarvajanik nahin honi chahie It is noteworthy that former Foreign Minister Natwar Singh has written in his book that Rahul did not want Sonia Gandhi to become the Prime Minister at any cost
 rahul ko dar tha ki unki maa kii bhi daadi indira gandhi or pita rajeev gandhi kii tarah hatya kar di jaaegi
 Natwar Singh has also claimed that on May 7, Priyanka met him in the dress of a woman mufti and requested that he not mention the 2004 Sonia episode in the book
 natwar singh kaa yah bhi daawa he ki sonia ne unke saath hue bartaav ke liye maafee maangi
 It is written in the book that Sonia had access to all the important files of the government and all the necessary decisions were taken at 10 Janpath
 natwar singh ke mutabik, party par sonia gandhi kaa niyantran indira gandhi se zyada tha
 Everything he said was law for the party
 rajeev sarkaar main mantri rah chuke natwar daawa karte hai ki sonia gandhi rajeev se bhi behatar netaa hai
 On this, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, i did not show any file to Sonia Gandhi, private conversation should not be public
 upie sarkaar main videshmantri rahe 83 saal ke natwar singh ko 2005 main tel ke badale anaaj ghotaale main naam aane ke baad istipha dena padaa tha
 He then left the Congress in 2008
 congress ke netaa anand sharma ne is bare main kaha ki yah unka kathan he
 He said this after going out of the party after 9-10 years
 donon taraf kii baat hoti he
 People should read the book, it can be done for the promotion of it
 ensipi netaa deepi treepathi ne kaha ki natwar singh shikshit rajaneta hai
 There are relations with the time of Nehru ji, also during the time of Indira ji, Rajiv ji and Sonia ji
 unhone galat nahin likhaa hoga
 BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain said that the face of Congress has been exposed
 ham or modi ji jo kehete the ki maa-bete ke haathon main satta he, vahi sabit hua
 CPI leader Atul Anjan said that when he was foreign secretary, he was intelligent, mortgaged (mind) when he came to Congress
 pehle kehete the ki leader is rhite, maai future is brit
 Today says that the leader is wrong, my future is not good basapa netaa mayawati ne kaha ki unhone (natwar singh) apni kitaab kaa sandarbh dekar jo kuch bhi congress adhyaksh ke bare main kaha, uskaa jawaab unke mantri de rahe hai
 That would be appropriate
 team india ke purv diarector ravi shastri ne bhi bhartiya team ke coach pad ke liye aavedan de diya he or ab khabaren aa raheen hai ki shastri ko bharat ke purv mahaan ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ne aavedan dene ke liye raji kiya
 At the behest of Sachin Tendulkar, Shastri has applied for the post of coach of the Indian team
 times of india ke mutabik shastri or sachin donon hi landan main chhuttiyaan manaa rahe hai
 In London, Sachin spoke to Shastri and persuaded him to apply
 siesi ke 3 sadasyon main se ek sachin kaa maananaa he ki bharat ke captain viraat kohli bhi shastri ko bataur coach dekhnaa chaahate hai or donon ke bich achche rishte bhi hai
 In such a situation, Sachin negotiated with Shastri and persuaded him to apply
 isse pehle khabaren thim ki shastri ne kaha tha ki wo coach pad kii res main nahin hai or unhone iske peeche pichley saal hui ghatana ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 Let us tell you that Shastri was scheduled to be the coach last year, but Anil Kumble was made the coach on the n occasion
 haal hi main shastri ne is baat kaa khulaasa bhi kiya tha ki unhone bhartiya team ke coach pad ke liye aavedan diya he
 Apart from Shastri, the race for the post of coach includes Virender Sehwag, Lalchand Rajput, Dodda Ganesh, Tom Moody, Richard Pybus and Craig mcdermott
 isisi champions trophy ke baad anil kumble ne coach pad se istipha de diya tha or kaha tha ki unki style, coach bane rahanaa kohli ko pasand nahin he
 Let me tell you that in 2016, when CAC chose Anil Kumble as coach, then apart from Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman were members of CAC, then the team's director Shastri was supposed to be the coach, but Anil Kumble's entry changed all the equations
 tendulkar ne tab bhi shastri kaa paksh liya tha or kaha tha ki team bhi unke saath khush he or unhen hi team kaa coach niyukt karnaa chahie, lekin us vakt saurav ganguli ne anil kumble ko tarjeeh di
 What was decided in this conversation will be known only by the meeting between the Prime Ministers of the two countries in Beijing and then the agreements between the two countries

 hamen 15 agast 1947 ko angrejon kii gulaami se aazaadee mili thi
 On this day, India got a different identity on the world map
 saath hi hamen mili raashtragan 'jan-gana-man' gane kii aazaadee
 In the year 2016, it was made mandatory to play the national anthem at Cinemahal
 aaie jaanate hai ki kin aath jagahon par raashtragan bajaanaa jaruri he or kya hai raashtragan gane ke anya niyam
 The Supreme Court stated these rules- The national anthem will be played before the film starts in theaters
 -raashtragan bajte samay screen par raashtra dhvaj dikhaaya janaa anivaary he
 - The doors of the hall should be closed while the national anthem is played
 - raashtragan ke samay haul main maujuud log iske sammaan main khadey hon
 - The national anthem will not be allowed to be shortened or truncated
 - raashtragan kaa aarthik laabh ke liye istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 - In no case will the dramatization of the national anthem be allowed, the eight occasions when the president's arrival at the official or ceremonial state functions and other functions organized by the national anthem
 raashtrapati yaa sambandhit rajyon / sangh rajya kshetron ke andar rajyapal / leftinent governor ke aagaman jaise vishesh avasaron par raashtragan bajaayaa jaataa he
 On arrival of the Governor / Lieutenant Governor in formal state programs within their State / Union Territory
 cinema haul main film shuru hone se purv ise bajaayaa jaataa he
 The national anthem is sung before and after the President's address to the nation on All India Radio
 jab rashtriya dhvaj tirange ko parade main lagaaya jaae to raashtragan gaaya jaataa he
 The national anthem is sung when the colors of the regiment are presented
 bhartiya nausena ke rangon ko fahraane ke liye raashtragan gaaya jaataa he
 Earlier, it was the rule of the national anthem to play the national anthem even after the end of the film in the cinema hall during 1960
 lekin ye film ke baad main bajane ke kaaran log isse pehle nikal jate the, isliye ise band kiya gaya
 On the expulsion of children, the Supreme Court said a unique case came in 1985 when three children of a particular sect in Tamil Nadu refused to sing the national anthem at school
 prabandhan ne unhen skool se nikaal diya to bacchon ne court kaa sahaara liya
 The Supreme Court ruled in this case that there is no compulsion to stand and sing it during the national anthem
 isamen insaan kii patibaddhta bhi jimmedaar he
 The sentence can be three years old, but the rule is also that if someone does not stand during the national anthem at the state program or refuses to sing it then it is not punishable
 agar koi swatantraaa diwas par rashtriya kaaryakramon main raashtragan gaate vakt jaan boojhkar vyavdhaan paidaa karata he, to use teen saal kii sajaa or jurmaana dena pad saktaa he

 For the Lok Sabha elections, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is going to different assemblies of Delhi and seeking votes these days
 aam aadmi party saaton seat par apane saansad ummidavaar ko jitaane ke liye puraa jor bhi laga rahi he lekin is bich 'aap' ke vidhayak arvind kejariwal ke pradhanmantri banane kii ichha janata ke saamne prakat karte najar aa rahe hai

 yahaan manch par mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke saath mantri satyendra jain bhi maujuud the
 Then in his speech 'AAP' MLA Ajesh Yadav, pointing to Arvind Kejriwal said, "good luck in the state like Chief Minister who gets you and MLA like me get Arvind Kejriwal, good luck in my political career
 main dua karata hum ki is desh ko aap (arvind kejariwal) pradhanmantri banakar mil jaaen to is desh kii kismat bhi acchhee
 "after this, Minister Satyendra Jain, who came to give a speech, was also appealed to the government forum to win the Aam Aadmi Party MP
 satyendra jain ne kaarykram main ai janata se poocha ki "dilli main 70 main se 67 seat jitai thi, is baar kitne saansad doge? agar vidhayak kejariwal ke, sarkaar kejariwal kii, to saansad bhi kejariwal ke hone chahie
 "an interesting turn came during Minister Satyendar Jain's speech when people were asked who would be the Prime Minister this time? Then the Aam Aadmi Party supporter present in the public replied in a loud voice 'arvind Kejriwal Sahab'
 satyendra jain ne piem modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki "is baar narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri nahin banenge to unke chakkar main mat padana kyonki piem modi khud videsh kaa chakkar lagaate rahe or desh kaa ghanchakkar bana diya he
 "appreciation from the government platform but Aam Aadmi Party mlas and supporters are now openly talking about seeing Arvind Kejriwal as Prime Minister

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday addressed a public meeting in Udupi, Karnataka
 piem modi ne apane bhaashan main karnataka kii janata ke saamne ek tir se do nishane saadhane kaa kaam kiya
 Referring to HD Deve Gowda at the election rally, he accused Congress President Rahul Gandhi of insulting the former Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki purv pradhanmantri devgauda ne dilli main jab bhi vakt maanga, main unase mila
 When Devgowda comes home, i open his car and welcome him
 jab ve jate hai to main unako gaadi main baitha kar aata hum
 He is our political opponent, but he is one of our respected leaders
 piem ne congress adhyaksh par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki congress adhyaksh chunavi sabhaaon main devgauda ji kaa kaise ullekh kar rahe the, ye aapkaa ahankaar he
 Your career has just started
 aap unhen apamaanit karte hai
 Now is the beginning of your life, how bad their coming days can be, you can think
 darasal congress adhyaksh ne karnataka main ek chunavi raily ke dauraan devgauda kii party janata dal secular (JDS) ko bijepi kii bi team bataaya tha
 Reversing this, Devgowda also said that this time will decide, whose b team is this
 bataa den 2004 main bijepi or jedies milakar karnataka main sarkaar bana chuke hai
 PM Modi's statement means PM Modi knows that if the BJP does not touch the majority figure in the election results, then Deve Gowda's party can become a JDS kingmaker
 tamaam opinian pole ke mutabik karnataka main kisi bhi party ko bahumat miltaa nahin dikh rahaa he
 In the India Today poll, the Congress is likely to get 90 to 101 seats and BJP 78 to 86 seats
 vahiin jedies ko 34-43 seat milane kii sambhaavna he
 In such a situation, if there is a hung assembly then the BJP may have to support the JDS for a majority
 yahi vajah he ki chunavi reliyon main piem modi congress party or rahul gandhi par to lagaataar hamale kar rahe hai lekin duusare ahm vipakshi dal jedies or unke netaaon ke prati naram ravaiya apana rahe hai
 What will remain of JDS? After the Opinion Poll, JDS chief spokesperson Danish Ali has said that JDS is contesting against both Congress and BJP in Karnataka
 unhone kaha ki jedies rashtriya str par gaiyr bijepi or gaiyr congressi kheme kii baat karti rahi he or deshbhar main donon rashtriya dalon se itar ek front taiyaar kar rahe hai
 He says that the local party has always been undermined in the polls, but in the result JDS is going to form the government with an absolute majority
 pichley chunaav ke nattejesal 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main rajya kii kul 224 siton main se congress ne 122 jiti thim jabaki bijepi or jedies ne 40-40 siton par kabja kiya tha
 The KJP of BS Yeddyurappa, who had contested with the BJP, could win just 6 seats
 iske alaava anya ko 16 siten mili thim
 However, Yeddyurappa later rejoined the BJP
 bataa den ki 225 sadasyeey karnataka vidhansabha ke liye 224 siton par ek hi charan main matdaan 12 may ko hoga
 Votes will be counted on 15 May
 agar aap kisi aise kaam kaa hissaa hai jisamen iskar adaa kiya jaataa ho to aapke liye aadhaar sankhya anivaary he
 If your financial condition is not in good shape or are among socially backward and need to take advantage of government welfare schemes, then you will have to show a unique 12 digit identification number
 or agar aap inamen se kisi main nahin aate lekin vittiya lenden karnaa chaahate hai to aapako sthaayee khaataa sankhya yaa pan number kii darkaar he
 But you will have to link your PAN number with Aadhaar
 thode main kahen to agar aap chaiyn se jeena chaahate hai, agar aap bharat kaa naagarik hone kii suvidhaon kaa laabh uthaanaa chaahate hai to aapako apni aadhaar sankchaya taiyaar rakhni hogi
 This is the practical meaning of the Supreme Court's judgment on 26 September granting the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar (targeted Distribution, Benefits and Services of Financial and Other Subsidiaries) Act, 2016
 haalanki isaki vaidhata ko kaayam rakhte hue supreme court kii paanch jajon kii peeth ne is adhinium kii dhara 57 ko radd kar diya, jo saamaan yaa seva muhaiyaa karne ke liye companiyon yaa kisi vyakti ko bhi aadhaar sankhya maangane kii ijaajat detii thi
 The Supreme Court in March 2017 also rejected the circular of TRAI which made it mandatory to link mobile numbers with Aadhaar
 ab aadhaar yojana par amal karne vaali agency bhartiya vishisht pahchaan praadhikaran (yuidi) ne doorsanchaar companiyon se supreme court ke aadesh ke mutabik aadhaar aadhaarit pramann vyavastha ko khatm karne kii yojana 15 aktubar tak pesh karne ko kaha he
 But the plans to link Aadhaar numbers with mobile phones and bank accounts are still bad
 kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali iske liye ek vidheyak sansad main paarit karne kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 a PIL has also been filed in the Madras High Court for linking Aadhaar with voter number and voter id card
 chunaav ayog bhi kah chukaa he ki use isamen koi aapatti nahin he
 Of course, you are entitled to many rights like voting without an Aadhaar card
 aap bank (sarkari bhi), phone companiyon or skool-collejon vagairah ko aadhaar sankhya bataane se inkaar kar sakate hai
 But by making Aadhaar mandatory for linking Aadhaar and PAN card and making PAN card mandatory, the Supreme Court has indirectly assured that your bank account details should reach the UIDAI
 desh main bank khaataa kholane ke liye ab pan sankhya anivaary he
 To allow Aadhaar to be linked to government welfare schemes, the court accepted the plea that widespread public interest is being achieved
 faisla sunaate vakt jaj arjan kumaar sikari ne kaha ki peeth is daleel se santusht he ki aadhaar ek jaij lakshya licage or durupyog kii rokthaam ke liye upyukt upaay he
 The court upheld Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, according to which it is mandatory for government schemes to be completed from the consolidated fund of the country
 matlab yah hua ki agar aap rashan, rasoi gas sabsidi, manaregaa vagairah ke laabh uthaanaa chaahate hai to aapako apni aadhaar sankhya yaa aadhaar aavedan sankhya bataani hogi
 Advocates of Aadhaar often argue that this has helped to remove the gaps in the distribution of government schemes
 supreme court ke faisle kaa swaagat karte hue niti ayog ke siio amitabh kaant ne kaha, "pahchaan ke liye aadhaar sankhya ke istemaal se khamiyaan dur karke kareeb 500 kalyankari yojanaon main har saal takreeban 90,000 karod ru
 Has been saved
 '' yahaan tak ki gopneeyata ke maamalon ke jaankaar lekhak rahul matthan isse sahamat hai ki aadhaar kaa digital infrastracchar kifayat baratane main madadgaar he
 He says, "the cost of the KYC (know Your Customer) process to get a loan is Rs 1,000
 aata he jabaki aadhaar aadhaarit i-kevaisi se yah kharch mahaj 5 ru
 Only sits ''haalanki janvari 2016 or march 2017 ke bich puduccheri, chandigarh or dadar-nagar haveli main niti ayog ke ek adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki aadhaar se jude bank khate ke jariye pratyaksh laabh hastantaran main licage pehle kii saarvajanik vitaran pranali kii licage ke mukaable kam nahin ho paae hai
 According to economist Ritika Kheda, an ardent advocate of data privacy, Aadhaar does not play a role in eliminating leakages or identifying a legitimate beneficiary, instead it has created a way to exclude people
 darasal kheda kaa daawa he ki aadhaar yojana kaa praathmik lakshya zyada se zyada logon ko shaamil karne or kalyankari yojanaon kii prakriya main sudhaar laana kabhi nahin rahaa
 He wrote in a column, "to take a clear business project forward, welfare schemes are being wrapped in sugar syrup
 in vyavsaayik gatividhiyon ke liye aadhaar jaise digital infrastracchar kii darkaar he, jise saarvajanik paise se taiyaar kar liya gaya
 "to substantiate her claim, she says that many" volunteers "who helped build Aadhaar infrastructure are now using it to build their business
 supreme court ne unke ek lekh par gaur kiya jisamen unhone jharkhand main 900 pariwaron ke surveykshan kaa zikr kiya tha
 The survey proved that the most vulnerable people like elderly widows could not go to the shop to complete their identity due to the compulsory Aadhaar identification process, and this caused great hardship to others
 tatkaaleen pradhan nyaayadhish deepak mishra kii aguai vaali peeth isse sahamat ho gai ki aadhaar vanchit tabake tak laabh pahunchane ke liye hi taiyaar kiya gaya magar usne sarkaar ko spasht chetavanee bhi di, "vittiya laabh ke daayre se baahar karne kii gambhir shikayaton ke sandarbh main adaalat kaa nirdesh he ki aadhaar sankhya ke bahaane ek bhi vyakti anaaj vitaran jaisi kalyankari yojanaon se vanchit nahin kiya janaa chahie
 "but the major concern of the petitioners challenging the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar law is the Aadhaar mechanism which allows the government to have a comprehensive watch over society
" yachikakartaon kii daleel thi ki aadhaar kanoon niztaa ke buniyadi adhikaar kaa ulanghan karata he, jise supreme court ne 2017 main vaid bataaya he
 The Aadhaar project mechanism has a Central Identity Data Base (CIDR), which holds the data and calculates its authentication
 ek yachikakarta kii daleel thi ki is tantra ke jariye sarkari adhikari pramanikaran chaahane vaale vyakti ke sthaan kaa pataa laga sakate hai
 Jean Petrez, a petitioner economist, says that the court's ruling limited the strength of the government to connect to various databases and build infrastructure by stance
 varisht vakil shyaam dewan ne supreme court main daleel rakhi ki aadhaar pariyojna logon par niyantran rakhane kaa electronic saadhan he
 Kheda says, "centralized and interconnected database tracking makes profiling easier which can also increase the tendency towards self-censorship which endangers our independence
 ''vaaki, agar aadhaar aakhirkaar bank khate, mobile number or voter card se jud jaataa he to sarkaar apane nagarikon par din-raat najar rakhane ke kaabil ho jaaegi
 The government's "aadhaar should be compulsory" with its shout was expressed by its critics
 matthan bhi isse to sahamat hai ki vibhinn databes ko jodgaye kii sambhaavna logon kii gopneeyata ko khatre main daal sakati he
 He says, "aadhaar data is not dangerous in itself
 khatarnaak yah he ki aadhaar manaregaa, rasoi gas vitaran jaise sarkari databes se jod diya jaae
 At present, these are the responsibility of different ministries and it is not easy to combine them
 lekin unhen agar jodgaye kii koi pahal he to pichley saal supreme court kii vyakhya ke mutabik niztaa ke adhikaar ko jarur dhyaan main rakhaa janaa chahie
 On these concerns, the court gave attention but said that there is only a minimum data in Aadhaar and it is used in the wider public interest
 haalanki adaalat ne aanshik raahat bhi muhaiyaa kii
 The provision was repealed which allowed the records of authentication to be kept for five years, that is, whenever someone used Aadhaar to reveal his identity, his record would be kept for five years
 aisa record ab sirf chah maheene tak hi rakhaa ja sakegaa
 The court also banned the keeping of meta data of people's transactions
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki yuidi data set ikattha nahin kar saktaa or use aage data vishleshan ke khatir istemaal nahin kar saktaa
 The Supreme Court also repealed Section 33 (2) of the Aadhaar Act, which allowed security agencies to provide data in the name of national security
 kanoon kii dhara 47 bhi khaarij ho gai jiske mutabik aadhaar data chori hone kii shikaayat karne kaa adhikaar sirf sarkaar ko tha
 Now anyone can complain about it
 supreme court ne sarkaar se data suraksha ke liye jitani jaldi sambhav ho, sakht kanoon banane ko bhi kaha
 At present, the government is examining the draft Personal Data Security Bill, 2018, which Justice B
 en
 The committee was appointed in July by the Srikrishna-led expert committee
 is vidheyak ke masaude kii sabase tikhi aalochana yah ho rahi he ki isamen nijee khiladinnon ke data gopneeyata bhang karne par unke khilaaf sakht karrwai ke to praavdhaan hai magar sarkaar ke maamle main yah naram ho jaataa he
 According to Smriti Pashira, a consultant with the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, stringent provisions need to be made in the proposed bill in terms of data availability to other agencies guarding intelligence and law
 ve kahati hai, "report main jo kaha gaya he or prastaavit vidheyak main vah jis rup main shaamil kiya gaya he, usamen kaaphi fark he
 For example, in the case of providing data to intelligence and police agencies, the report clearly states that the current system is inadequate and needs reforms like pre-judicial review to allow for scrutiny
 lekin yah vichaar vidheyak ke masaude main nahin aa paaya he
 "justice Shri Krishna is also aware of the danger of governmental scrutiny"
 unhone sifarish kii he ki karypalika kii taak-jhaank kii karrwai par nyaayik dekharekh sambandhi kanoon banaae
 Says Matthan, "there is also a proposal to seek parliamentary approval every six months for such vigor so that the three pillars of democracy can become participants

 Probably because of this drawback, the government also takes the courage to defy the order of the Supreme Court in the case of Aadhaar
 masalan, 2015 main mahaj paanch kalyankari yojanaon tak aadhaar ko simit rakhane ke supreme court ke nirdesh ke baavjood narendra modi sarkaar ne kam se kam teen darjan kalyankari yojanaon se aadhaar ko jod diya
 Now the Supreme Court has warned the government that those who do not have Aadhaar, should not be denied welfare schemes as there is still no mechanism and guidelines for them
 supreme court ne aadhaar kanoon main kaise pherbadal kiye-kanoon kii dhara 57 ko radd kiya gaya, jo companiyon yaa vyaktiyon ko bhi saamaan yaa sevaaon ke lenden main aadhaar card maangane kii ijaajat detii thi- dhara 33 (1) pahchaan or pramanikaran kerecord vagairah sambandhi suchanaaen ujagar karne kii ijaajat detaa tha, basharte jila jaj se neeche kii adaalat kaa aadesh na ho
 Regarding this sub-section, the Supreme Court has now said that the person should be given a chance to be heard - Section 33 (2) of the law was rejected which was directed by the Joint Secretary level officer of the Central Government in the interest of national security
 It was allowed to reveal identification and certification records
 supreme court ne faisla sunaaya ki is maamle main koi nyaayik adhikari (hycourt kaa koi maujuuda jaj ho to behatar) judaa hona chahie or ki sarkaar is bare main nayaa kanoon laae-dhara 47 radd ho gai jo data chori ke maamle main shikaayat kaa adhikaar kisi vyakti ko nahin, balki sirf yuidi ko adhikaar detii thi
 Now if anyone thinks that his data was stolen, he can complain - the provision of keeping identity authentication records safe for five years has been rejected
 ab ise sirf chah maheene tak rakhaa ja sakegaa-vyaktiyon ke lenden ke meta data ko surakshit rakhane kaa praavdhaan khaarij
 This means that UIDAI cannot create a data set and cannot be kept safe for further data or analysis - UIDAI cannot share data with companies *** kenya ke suraksha balon ne nairobi ke westeget shopping mal ko apane ‘niyantran’ main le liya he

 The atmosphere on both sides of the border line of India and Pakistan drawn on the foundation of hate is warm
 vaise to hindustan or pakistan ke bich paanch tarah kii sarahadi lakeeren hai, magar sabase zyada halchal is vakt elosi yani line of control par he
 The same loc that India crossed and hit Pakistan in Pakistan and since then Pakistan has been bugged and is constantly trying to disturb the loc
 sarhad par date hamaare jawan itane mustaid hai ki PAK kii ek nahin chal rahi
 Pakistan's Uri attack was retaliated by penetrating three kilometers of loc with a surgical strike
 is hamale ke baad se hi pakistan baukhalaayaa hua he
 He is unable to digest that Hindustan can enter the house and kill him
 lihaaja ab wo is firaaq main laga hua he ki kaise bhi or kisi bhi tarah apni sharmindagi mitaa sake
 For this, he is constantly flirting and is also continuously firing on the loc in the same flick
 magar pakistan ye nahin jaanata ki border ke sher jaage hue hai
 On every line that draws Pakistan's line, our soldiers have their eyesighted
 eloasi se lekar aleosi, bharat-pakistan international border se lekar varking border har jagah, chappe-chappe par nigaraanee rakhi ja rahi he
 Actually, the borders of India and Pakistan are divided into five parts, that is, there are five types of borders: 1
 eloasi- line of ektual controlaye siachin kii seemaa tay karti he
 2
 elosi- line of controlaye sirfkashmirase lagata he
 This is considered a disputed boundary
 3
 The working border draws the lines of Sialkot in Pakistan and Kashmir in India
 4
 There is no border dispute with india-pakistan border
 5
 The maritime boundary draws the line of the maritime boundary and line of Kutch of both countries
 line of control ko chhod kar donon deshon ke bich baaki kisi seemaa ko lekar aisa bada vivaad nahin he
 Now, since both countries consider LOC to be disputed, LOC is the most stirred
 kehete hai ki duniya main south korea or elosi se zyada kisi or border par itani gasht nahin hoti
 The surgical strike on the loc in response to the Uri attack was also part of a thought-provoking strategy of India
 chunki elosi ko vaise hi donon desh vivaadit maanate hai
 In such a situation, such an operation inside the loc cannot be considered as infiltration or attack on that country, nor can it be called war
 PAK fouj ko sargical strike kii jaankareelabatta agar bharat yahi sargical strike bharat-paak border ke kisi hisse main ghus kar karata, tab use seemaa kaa ulanghan yaa jang kii dhamkee mana jaataa or ye baat khud pakistan ke visheshgy bhi kah rahe hai
 After the surgical strike, the Indian Army Nepakistani army was also informed about this operation
 vajah yahi thi ki jahaan par ye oparation hua, wo elosi tha yani vivaadit jagah
 The border is round the clock, there is a movement on both sides of the india-pakistan border
 chaahe tainaati kii baat ho, gasht kii yaa phir chaukasee kii
 BSF is fighting on some fronts together on the outskirts
 paak fouj or rangers par najar rakhane ke saath-saath use pakistan ke belgaum aatankwaadi sanghathanon se jude aatankwaadiyon se bhi nipatna hota he
 But in spite of all these misdeeds, the brave people of India are ready round the clock to give a befitting reply to the nefarious misdeeds of Pakistan
 parinda bhi nahin maar saktaa paruri se lekar baraamula or hiranagar se lekar akhnur tak bharat or pakistan ke border par biguef kii aisi nigaraanee he ki parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa
 It is one thing to monitor the border in the sunlight during the day and keep an eye on the cowardly terrorists in the dark darkness of the night
 contile taron par 440 volt kaa karantahiranagar ke puure ilaake main border par contile taron kaa baad laga he, jis par 440 volt kaa karant daudta he
 Death is sure only by touching this wire, but BSF or military cannot breathe peace by just filling the wire
 aise main in taron ke saath-saath sarhad paar se honevaali kisi bhi golibari yaa hamale kaa munhtod jawaab dene ke liye hindustan ke jaanbaaj din raat taiyaar rahete hai or is kaam ke liye raat ke andhere main bulatopruf bakhtarband gaadiyaan javaanon kii madadgaar banati hai
 After seeing the action, the shoot at the site, BSF has also arranged for strong light at the border in the area, as well as night vision cameras are available with the soldiers
 taaki agar koi bhi ghuspaithiya is ilaake main suraksha intjaamon ko bhedane kii koshish kare, to use turant dekh liya jaae or dekhte hi goli maar di jaae or ye biguef ko di gai khaas chhot kii badaulat mumkin hua he, jisamen kisi bhi ghuspaith kii koshish yaa sandigdh harakat dekhte hi javaanon ko shoot at site yani dekhte hi goli maarane kii chhot di gai he
 We sleep peacefully as they monitor so there are not a hundred threats along the border, ranging from firing across the border to wild animals and poisonous snakes
 lekin hindustan ke jaanbaaj hai ki jaan hatheli par lekar har vakt in border kii nigaraanee karte hai
 Now with the passing time, BSF has technically upgraded itself
 is vakt biguef ke paas dhai sau gaj kii range tak vaale nite vijan camere hai, to telescope raifal bhi he
 Jaisalmer's indo-pak borderjaisalmer's indo-pak border has been very important from the beginning, but the current situation between the two countries has increased the tension here a bit
 asal main sarhad ke us paar bahawalpur or rahim yaar khan jaise ilaake hai, jahaan hafiz said or ajahar masood jaise aatanki sarganaon kii halchal rahati he
 In such a situation, BSF is bound to be more alert here
 bharat-pakistan kii seemaa se lage is registani ilaake main mushkil halaat ke bich choubison ghante sarhad kii chaukasee kisi badi chunauti se kam nahin he
 Although the border is already sensitive to the infiltration of terrorists and smugglers, but now its sensitivity in the new situation has increased much more
 ek taraf hindustan ke sargical strike kaa dard pakistan ko saal rahaa he, vahiin duusari taraf border ke us paar bahawalpur or rahim yaar khan jaise ilaake hai, jahaan aatankwaadi gatividhiyaan bhi chalati rahati hai
 Although this border is special in some other ways too, the BSF is also involved in monitoring this border
 oont hai javaanon ke sabase bharosemand sathibief kii ek cmand main kareeb 20 post hoti hai, jisaki seemaa kareeb 60-65 kilometre hoti he
 In such a situation, the camel remains the most trusted companion of these soldiers
 paidal gasht ke saath hi border par fensing ke bich jagah-jagah khaali bottlen latakaai gai hai
 Its purpose is also very special
 sarhad par rahane waalon kii bhi hifaazat karte hai hamaare javansarkaar ne beshak sarahadi gaanvon ko khaali karaane kaa hukum jari kar diya ho, lekin jaanbaaj hindustani javaanon kii tarah sarhad par based log bhi pakistan se muqabla karne ko taiyaar rahete hai
 These villagers have full faith in their army and BSF
 ye or baat he ki kai gaanv sarkaar ke aadesh ke baad kaaphi had tak khaali ho chuke hai, lekin pakistan ko sabak sikhaane kii khwaahish logon ke dilon main he

 adaalat ne teacher bhartee ghotaalaa maamle main aaropee chautaala ko jail adhikariyon ke saamne sarender karne ke nirdesh die
 Earlier, Chautala today appeared in the Tisahjari court of Delhi in the case of excess income from property and requested exemption from appearance in the court
 lekin chautaala ke is anurodh kaa sibiai ne virodh kiya
 79-year-old Chautala was present in the court under the order of Special CBI Judge Manu Rai Sethi, in which he himself was asked to be present
 inelo pramukh ne haryana chunaav prachaar abhiyaan main bhaag lene kii anumati ke liye aavedan kiya tha
 However, Special Public Prosecutor Ajay Kumar Gupta opposed Chautala's plea stating that he should not be exempted from being present in private as he was not intentionally involved in court proceedings
 sibiai ne yah bhi kaha ki pichley kai baar se vah swasthya yaa anya kisi kaaran kaa hawala dete hue chhot le rahe hai
 The agency also said that Chautala could not be exempted from attending rallies as the court asked him to appear regularly during the hearing while granting regular bail
 isi bich sibiai ne aaj yah anurodh bhi kiya ki adaalat dilli hai court dwaara jari kiye gaye adalati notice ko aaropee ko saunpane main madad karen kyonki vah jaanboojhkar ise nazarandaaj kiye ja rahaa he
 The court recorded the statement in the case of disproportionate assets

 Accepting the CBI request, the court handed over the notice issued by the High Court to Chautala and Chautala assured his presence
 3,206 jebiti shikshakon kii avaidh niyukti ke maamle main dilli kii ek adaalat ne chautaala ko 22 janvari 2013 ko 10 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 The court said, since the accused is appearing before this court and his lawyers are not opposing giving him a High Court notice in this court, then the applicant should be given notice to Chautala not going into the dispute raised by the CBI
