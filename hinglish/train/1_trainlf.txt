 The country's oldest party is headed by Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 ravivaar ko congress ke planry seshan main pisisi delygat or eisisi ke sadsy maujuudagi main kaarysmiti ke sadasyon ke chunane ke adhikaar party adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko die jane vaale prastaav ko sarvasammati se paas kar diya gaya he
 Now the names of members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) can be stamped soon
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki rahul ab apni team ke sadasyon ke naam khud tay karenge
 Significantly, the Working Committee is the top decision-making body in the Congress
 isliye party kaa har diggaj netaa kaarysmiti ke sadasyon main apana naam dekhnaa chahta he
 On Sunday, the right to select the names of the members of the new Working Committee of Congress has been unanimously handed over to Rahul
 bataa den ki congress adhyaksh banane ke baad rahul gandhi ke saamne ek ahm kaam party kaarysmiti ke gathan ko anjaam dena he
 The working committee consists of a total of 25 members, including the Congress President
 inamen 12 sadsy manonith hote hai or 12 kaa chunaav hota he
 Rahul has been given the right to nominate all the members of the party's working committee in the plenary session of the Congress
 haalanki aamtaur par congress adhyaksh hi CWC members ko manonith karte hai
 All AICC members of Congress authorized Rahul to be CWC members
 rahul gandhi ab 24 sadsy manonith karenge
 In this way, elections will not be held for the members of the 12 working committee
 pehle se hi mana ja rahaa tha ki party kii koshish yahi thi ki, eisisi member hi sabhi kaarysmiti ke sadasyon ko chunane kaa adhikaar ek sur se congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko saunp den, phir rahul apni kaarysmiti kaa gathan apane hisaab se karen
 It happened according to the estimates of the Congress and the right to choose the members of the working committee was handed over to Rahul
 darasal congress main adhiktar netaaon kaa maananaa tha ki kyonki is vakt party ko ekajute hokar rahul ke netritv main bijepi se takaraane kii jarurat he, aise main party ke bheetar kaarysmiti kii 12 siton ke liye chunaav karakar netaaon main aapasi khinchataan jaisaa koi sandesh dene kii koi tuk nahin banataa he
 Congress leader RPN Singh was following the democratic process in the Congress- 'there is no electoral process in the BJP, the media remains silent on it, whereas in the Congress the democratic process is followed
 congress adhyaksh ke chunaav main bhi sabake saamne hua or aage bhi hoga
 'overall, Rahul has also understood that realism has to be trusted only in the politics of idealism and realism
 isiilie badlaav karke halke phulke tareeke se youth congress or enesayuai main to rahul kaa prayog chal rahaa he, lekin mul congress main vahi hota dikh rahaa he jo pehle bhi hota aayaa he
 Rahul Gandhi changed the way of politics: 14 years ago, Rahul has changed from going into politics to becoming Congress President
 saath hi unki siyasat kaa tarika bhi badla he
 As soon as he entered politics, Rahul was seen campaigning for the promotion of democracy in the Congress
 team rahul america or england kii tarj par party ke bheetar chunaav karaane kii vakaalat karti najar ai
 Rahul, who became general secretary of the party at the 2006 Hyderabad session, got the charge of the party's student organization NSUI and Youth Congress
 yahaan rahul ne manonayan kii prakriya ko khatm karke chunaav karaane shuru kar die
 Rahul's move was widely criticized within the party itself
 rahul kii is niti par netaaon kaa kahana rahaa qi, soch acchhee he, lekin abhi hindustan kii siyasat iske liye taiyaar nahin he
 Along with this, there were reports of indiscriminate use of money in most places and the children and relatives of the leaders got the posts easily
 2014 ke baad se thande baste main he yojanarahul yaheen nahin ruke, saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhone payalat project ke taur par 15 siton par primary yojana lagu kii
 Under this, the candidate was selected by election from the Lok Sabha seat among the party ticket contenders
 vaise to 2014 ke chunaav main congress virdohi maahaul tha hi, lekin primary vaali siton main se congress sab par haar gai
 However, since 2014, the scheme is in complete disarray
 darasal, party ke puraane ranneetikaron kaa maananaa he ki, is tarah kaa tarika apnaane se chunaav se pehle hi party ke bheetar foot or jhagada bad jaataa he, jiskaa nuksaan party ko hota he
 At present, there cannot be politics in India on the lines of America or England
 saath hi jab har party is system se chale to hi isko congress main lagu kiya jaye
 As in America or England
 kiye gaye kai badlaaviske baad rahul kaa payalat project puri tarah band to nahin hua, lekin youth congress or enesayuai main chunavi prakriya main kaaphi badlaav kar die gaye
 Yes, Rahul's plan to hold elections in the original Congress has been put on hold
 shaayad rahul bhi hindustan kii siyasat kii hakeekat se rubaru ho chuke hai
 But how could Rahul kill his heart's desire completely
 isiilie party adhyaksh manonith hone kii netaaon kii salaah ko unhone nakaar diya, wo chaahate to aasaani se sonia gandhi ke baad party adhyaksh manonith ho sakate the
 It was only after Rahul's insistence that the entire process of election of the party president took place
 haalanki, ummid ke mutabik, rahul ke saamne kisi netaa ne namakan hi nahin bharaa or rahul bina matdaan ke party adhyaksh kaa chunaav jeet gaye
 Actually, party leaders say that democracy in the party means that, by first mutual interaction, it is good to decide together
 party ke bheetar ke chunaav or aam chunaav main fark hota he
 Even after the general election, the losers of each party do not have to face one person against another, while the election within the party is heartbreaking, mutual accusations are repeated, after which fighting the other party one by one

 Jaya Ekadashi 2019: The name of Ekadashi of Shuklapaksha of Magha month is Jaya Ekadashi
 jaya ekadshi sabhi paapon ko haraane vaali sabase uttam ekadshi maani jaati he
 This Ekadashi destroys all the sins of a person due to being holy
 iskaa prayek varsh vrath karne se manushyon ko bhoga or moksh kii prapti hoti he
 By reciting fasting prayers on Jaya Ekadashi, one gets freedom from sins such as brahmacharya
 har kaary main vijay ke liye jaya ekadshi kii puja kii jaati he
 What to do on Jaya Ekadashi Caution- Get up and take a bath before sun rise on Jaya Ekadashi
 - ghar main lahasun pyaaj or tamsik bhojan bilkul bhi naa banaaen
 Use clean and yellow clothes in the worship of Ekadashi, it is useless
 - jaya ekadshi kaa vrath puri vidhi- vidhaan se karen or parivaar main shantipurvak maahaul banaae rakhen or man hi man vishnu mantra kaa jaap karte rahen
 How to worship Lord Vishnu on Jaya Ekadashi - The worship of Lord Vishnu on Jaya Ekadashi starts a day before that, on the night of Dashami, with the fasting rule
 - dashami tithi ke din suryaast ke baad bhojan grahan nahin karnaa chahie
 If possible at night, then chant any mantra of Lord Vishnu
 jaise namo narayanaay
 - Wake up before sunrise in the morning, mix Ganga water in your bath water and take bath and wear clean clothes and meditate on Lord Vishnu
 - purv disha kii taraf ek patare par pilaa kapadaa bichhaakar bhagwaan vishnu kii photo ko sthapit karen
 Burn incense lamps and install the urn
 - bhagwaan vishnu ko apane samarthy ke anusaar vastra, fal, phool, paan supaari, nariyal, laung, aanwala aadi arpan karen or swayan bhi pile asana par baith jaaen
 Wish to fulfill your heart's desire by taking water in your right hand and also pray to calm the afflicted planets
 bhagwaan vishnu ke saamne sankalp len
 - Stay fast throughout the day, listen to the fasting story of Jaya Ekadashi in the evening and make a flourish
 - shaam ke samay bhagwaan vishnu kii pratimaa ke saamne ek gaay ke ghi kaa deepak jalaaen
 Now, on the second day in the morning, after feeding the Brahmins and giving Dakshina, they should eat themselves after that
 jaya ekadshi par tulsi maala dhaaran karne ke laabh-- jyotish ke anusaar tulsi kii maala pahanane se budh or guru grah balavaan hote hai
 According to the scriptures, it is said that wearing Tulsi garland gives all kinds of happiness and does not look bad
 - tulsi kii maala pahanane se pehle ise ganga jal or dhoop jarur dikhaaen
 - Before wearing the garland of Tulsi, go to the temple and worship Srihari
 - jo log tulsi kii maala pahante hai, unhen pyaaj lahasun or maansaahaar se dur rahanaa chahie
 Perform Jupiter on Jaya Ekadashi- Get up before sunrise on Jaya Ekadashi
 - saaf halake pile rang ke kapade pahane
 - Paint 5 white Janeu with saffron and take 5 clean yellow fruits
 - ab tulsi kii maala se pile asana par baithkar namo bhagavate vasudevy mantra kaa teen maala jaap karen
 - After chanting, the five genera and yellow fruits are offered in the temple of Lord Vishnu and must say the desire of the mind in front of Lord Vishnu
 - swayan prasad ke rup main ek kelaa ghar par le aaen or parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon ko den
 - Maintain peace of mind in the whole pooja lesson
 kisko samajhaayaa jaae
 To the daughter or the father of the daughter
 kya sirf yahi hai jo aisa karte hai yaa or bhi kai log hai jo apane bacchon ko kanoonee umr se pehle scooter bike de dete hai
 After all, it was early that these men caught their seven-year-old daughter with the handle of Scooty
 record kii jagaprasiddh kitabon main rozaana duniya bhar se shaamil hone vaale record kisi kabad se kam nahin hai magar us kabad ke liye koi apane bacchon ko dharmik granth ratwa rahaa he to koi teen chaar din tak naachata hi ja rahaa he
 We do not know whether this father of Hyderabad has any such intention or not, but no one can understand that it is putting both his and his daughter's life in danger
 ho saktaa he ki sadak par inhen bachaane ke chakkar main koi bekasoor apni gaadi kahin or bhida de or maaraa jaae
 Papa Ji told our colleague Uma Sudhir that i do not refuse what she says
 agar aap darshakon main is level kaa koi papa he to pleez khud ko check kiijie
 Its father said that since the age of four, Scooty has been running, that has been driving Scooty for three years
 yah video bataa rahaa he ki sirf mummy papa ho jane se duniya main sahi galat samajhane kii akl nahin aa jaati he
 We get very emotional about the parents and start making Goddess
 mummy daddy ko bhi lagane lagata he ki ve calendar vaale bhagwaan hai
 Please start considering yourself as simple human
 had to ye thi ki camere ke saamne papa ji ko baat karte vakt hansi hi aa rahi thi
 Do not do this at all, even after such a warning, there is no shortage of people who will do exactly that
 hyderabad ke ek parivaar ke laalan paalan kaa record sabakaa nahin ho saktaa magar aise record banane vaale ab kai pariwaron main mil jate hai
 All the railway stations of Mumbai will have a ubiquitous and omniscient device called CCTV, yet how is it not known that some boys pass through the station playing on the moving rail
 ab aap in schuli bacchon ko dekhie kis tarah se chalati train main chadh jate hai
 They are doing all this in the fun of climbing up after the local opening
 chalati train se jhuk kar platform kii sataha ko chune kaa prayaas karte hai
 The feet are rubbed off the surface of the platform
 schuli bacchon ne lagata he is noujvaan se siikhaa hoga jo jhukkar zamin chhu rahaa he
 Some boys are hanging out in strange weird ways
 platform aane ke baad bhi train kii chat par khadey hai or khidki se latake hue hai
 Now they are at risk of life with this stunt, due to them, someone else can also be killed
 platform par inke phisalane se koi doosraa bhi chapet main aa saktaa he
 You must have seen these photos before
 samasya ye he ki samasya sirf dikhaane kii hi chiz banakar rah gai he
 Why did the railway administration not control it? kya ye bhi koi khubi he jise ham duniya ke liye bachaakar rakhana chaahate hai
 Thanks to a youth like Dipesh, he took two months to record eight hours of such footage
 in tasveeron ko dekhakar lagata he ki jaan kii baazi lagaakar local main stant karnaa kitna aasaan ho gaya he
 Youngsters like Deepesh have formed an institution, War Angest Railway Rowdy
 ye video isliye taiyaar kiya gaya he taaki rail prashasan dekhe or karrwai karne ke liye majaboor ho
 Sunil Singh spoke to Western Railway Commissioner Anand Vijay Jha of the Railway Protection Force
 unka kahana he ki paryaapt sankhya bal nahin he is par lagaam lagane ke liye
 They also have to see whether the passenger is hanging under compulsion or doing a deliberate stunt
 ajeeb he
 Listen to them and decide by looking at the pictures together that someone is standing under compulsion on the roof
 chalati rail kii chat par khadey rahane kaa santulan achaanak kisi majaburi main aa jaataa he yaa iske liye jaanaleva abhyaas kii zarurat hoti hogi
 The comments jaise ye ladkaa kisi pul ke neeche jhukta he to kya majaburi he
 Is there any law in compulsion to walk on the roof of the railway in this country
 jaan kii keemat badi he yaa majaburi
 Although the Railways has taken action against 2000 people last year, but it seems that action has not created fear among the people
 pichley saal yani jo 2015 tha usamen mumbai local se gir kar 806 logon kii maut ho gai
 Isn't it our failure to prevent such a large number of deaths? kya ye bilkul hi asambhav kaam he
 Last year 17 people died due to electrocution
 40 kii maut stant karne ke dauraan hui he
 In 2015, 13 people lost their lives due to hitting the polls
 haalanki gaiyr-sarkari aankadon main marane waalon kii sankhya kahin zyaada he
 Can't this disease be controlled in a week? suraksha ke lihaaz se bhi mumbai kaa railway stesan behad samvedansheel he
 Mumbai local has been the victim of terrorist incidents
 iske baad bhi agar railway prashasan kaa yah raivaya he to koi bhi is tarah kii harakat karata hua aa saktaa he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 These stunts are telling that we have not improved
 suraksha hamaari praathamikta nahin he
 It is not just the failure of the administration but it is also our failure as a civil society that the people walking in these trains have become normal about all these activities
 ek samasya or he local samaadhaan he to iske bheetar kai tarah kii samasya bhi he
 Local crowd is also deadly
 thuns kar logon ke chalane se dam bhi ghutata he
 The local railway carries 76 lakh people daily
 har baat kaa yahi jawaab nahin ho saktaa ki local main to hota hi rahata he ye sab
 The records which are included daily in the world of the famous books of records are no less than a junk, but for that junk, one is getting his children to recite religious texts and some are going to dance for three to four days
 hamen pataa nahin ki hyderabad ke is pita kii aisi koi manshaa he yaa nahin lekin koi bhi samaj saktaa he ki yah apni or apni beti donon kii zindagi khatare main daal rahaa he
 It may be that in the course of saving them on the road, someone innocently bumped and killed his car somewhere else
 papa ji ne hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ko kaha ki ye jo bhi kahati he main use manaa nahin karata hum
 If you have any father of this level in the audience, please check yourself
 iske papa ji ne kaha ki chaar saal kii umr se skuti chalaa rahi he yani teen saal ho gaye ise skuti chalaate hue
 This video is telling that just because Mummy is a father, there is no sense of right understanding in the world
 ham log maa baap ko lekar kuch zyaada hi bhavuk ho jate hai or dev devi banane lagate hai
 Mummy Daddy also begins to think that he is the God of the calendar
 pleez khud ko simpal maanav samajhnaa shuru kiijie
 The extent was that Papa ji was having a laugh while talking in front of the camera
 aisa bilkul na karen, is tarah kii chetavanee ke baad bhi aise logon kii kami nahin jo bilkul vaisaa hi karenge
 The record of rearing a family in Hyderabad may not be available to all, but those who make such records are now found in many families
 mumbai ke tamaam railway steshnon par sisitivi naamak sarvyaapee or sarvagyani yantra laga hi hoga, phir bhi kaise pataa nahin chalata ki kuch ladke chalati rail se khelte hue stesan se guzar jate hai
 Now see how these school children climb into the moving train
 local ke khulne ke baad chadh kar dikhaane kii masti main ye sab kar rahe hai
 Attempts to touch the surface of the platform by bending over the moving train
 platform kii sataha se paanv ragadate jate hai
 School children seem to have learned from this young man who is bending over and touching the ground
 kuch ladke ajeeb ajeeb tareeke se latake hue hai
 Even after the platform arrives, they are standing on the roof of the train and hanging from the window
 ab is stant se inhen jaan kaa khatara to he hi, inaki vajah se koi or bhi maaraa ja saktaa he
 Slipping on the platform can also catch someone else
 ye tasviren aapane pehle bhi dekhi hongi
 The problem is that the problem has become just a matter of showing
 rail prashasan ne aakhir is par lagaam kyon nahin lagaaya
 Is this also a quality that we want to preserve for the world? deepesh jaise yuva kaa shukriya ki unhone do maheene lagaakar aath ghante ke aise footage record kiye hai
 Looking at these pictures, it seems that it has become easy to do stunts in local by betting on my life
 deepesh jaise yuvaaon ne ek sanstha hi bana lee he waar anguest railway roudi
 This video has been prepared so that the railway administration is able to watch and take action
 sunil singh ne railway protection force ke pashchim railway ayukta anand vijay jha se baat kii
 He says that there is not enough strength to curb this
 inhen yah bhi dekhnaa hota he ki yatri majaburi main lataka he yaa jaanboojhkar stant kar rahaa he
 is peculiar
 aap inaki baat suniye or saath saath tasveeron ko dekhakar faisla kiijie ki koi chat par majaburi ke tahat khadaa he
 The balance of standing on the roof of a moving rail suddenly comes under some compulsion or it will require fatal practice
 tippaniyan If this boy bends under a bridge then what a compulsion
 kya majaburi main rail kii chat par chalane kaa koi kanoon he is desh main
 Life is a big cost or helplessness
 vaise railway ne pichley saal 2000 logon ke khilaaf karrwai kii he magar lagata he ki karrwai se logon main dar paidaa nahin ho sakaa he
 Last year i
e
 in 2015, 806 people fell from Mumbai local
 kya ye hamaari naakaami nahin he ki itani badi taadaad main maut kii sankhya ko roak nahin sake
 Is this an impossible task? pichley saal 17 logon kii karant lagane se maut ho gai he
 40 died during a stunt
 pole se takaraane kii vajah se 2015 main 13 logon ne apni jaan ganvaa di
 However, the death toll in non-official figures is much higher
 kya is beemaari ko ek hafte main kaabo nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Mumbai's railway station is also very sensitive in terms of security
 aatanki ghatnaon kaa shikaar rahi he mumbai local
 Even after this, if this is the ravaya of railway administration, then anyone can come and do anything like this
 ye stant bataa rahe hai ki ham sudhare nahin hai
 Safety is not our priority
 yah sirf prashasan kii naakaami nahin he balki ek naagarik samaaj ke rup main bhi hamaari naakaami he ki in trainon main chalane vaale log in sab harkaton ko lekar saamaanya ho gaye hai
 There is a problem and there is a local solution, so there are many problems within it
 local kii bheed jaanaleva bhi hoti he
 People are suffocated by the tamping
 76 lakh logon ko yahaan kii local rail rose dhoti he
 The answer to everything cannot be that all this happens in the local area
 agar aap darshakon main is level kaa koi papa he to pleez khud ko check kiijie
 Its father said that since the age of four, Scooty has been running, that has been driving Scooty for three years
 yah video bataa rahaa he ki sirf mummy papa ho jane se duniya main sahi galat samajhane kii akl nahin aa jaati he

 Thanks to a youth like Dipesh, he took two months to record eight hours of such footage

 Is there any law in compulsion to walk on the roof of the railway in this country

 Although the Railways has taken action against 2000 people last year, but it seems that action has not created fear among the people
 pichley saal yani jo 2015 tha usamen mumbai local se gir kar 806 logon kii maut ho gai
 Isn't it our failure to prevent such a large number of deaths? kya ye bilkul hi asambhav kaam he
 Last year 17 people died due to electrocution
 40 kii maut stant karne ke dauraan hui he
 In 2015, 13 people lost their lives due to hitting the polls
 haalanki gaiyr-sarkari aankadon main marane waalon kii sankhya kahin zyaada he
 Can't this disease be controlled in a week? suraksha ke lihaaz se bhi mumbai kaa railway stesan behad samvedansheel he
 Mumbai local has been the victim of terrorist incidents
 iske baad bhi agar railway prashasan kaa yah raivaya he to koi bhi is tarah kii harakat karata hua aa saktaa he or kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 These stunts are telling that we have not improved
 suraksha hamaari praathamikta nahin he
 It is not just the failure of the administration but it is also our failure as a civil society that the people walking in these trains have become normal about all these activities
 ek samasya or he local samaadhaan he to iske bheetar kai tarah kii samasya bhi he
 Local crowd is also deadly
 thuns kar logon ke chalane se dam bhi ghutata he
 The local railway carries 76 lakh people daily
 har baat kaa yahi jawaab nahin ho saktaa ki local main to hota hi rahata he ye sab
 Do not do this at all, even after such a warning, there is no shortage of people who will do exactly that
 hyderabad ke ek parivaar ke laalan paalan kaa record sabakaa nahin ho saktaa magar aise record banane vaale ab kai pariwaron main mil jate hai
 All the railway stations of Mumbai will have a ubiquitous and omniscient device called CCTV, yet how is it not known that some boys pass through the station playing on the moving rail
 ab aap in schuli bacchon ko dekhie kis tarah se chalati train main chadh jate hai
 They are doing all this in the fun of climbing up after the local opening
 chalati train se jhuk kar platform kii sataha ko chune kaa prayaas karte hai
 The feet are rubbed off the surface of the platform
 schuli bacchon ne lagata he is noujvaan se siikhaa hoga jo jhukkar zamin chhu rahaa he
 Some boys are hanging out in strange weird ways
 platform aane ke baad bhi train kii chat par khadey hai or khidki se latake hue hai
 Now they are at risk of life with this stunt, due to them, someone else can also be killed
 platform par inke phisalane se koi doosraa bhi chapet main aa saktaa he
 You must have seen these photos before
 samasya ye he ki samasya sirf dikhaane kii hi chiz banakar rah gai he
 Why did the railway administration not control it? kya ye bhi koi khubi he jise ham duniya ke liye bachaakar rakhana chaahate hai

 Attempts to touch the surface of the platform by bending over the moving train
 platform kii sataha se paanv ragadate jate hai
 School children seem to have learned from this young man who is bending over and touching the ground
 kuch ladke ajeeb ajeeb tareeke se latake hue hai
 Even after the platform arrives, they are standing on the roof of the train and hanging from the window
 ab is stant se inhen jaan kaa khatara to he hi, inaki vajah se koi or bhi maaraa ja saktaa he
 Slipping on the platform can also catch someone else
 ye tasviren aapane pehle bhi dekhi hongi
 The problem is that the problem has become just a matter of showing
 rail prashasan ne aakhir is par lagaam kyon nahin lagaaya
 Is this also a quality that we want to preserve for the world? deepesh jaise yuva kaa shukriya ki unhone do maheene lagaakar aath ghante ke aise footage record kiye hai
 Looking at these pictures, it seems that it has become easy to do stunts in local by betting on my life

 The balance of standing on the roof of a moving rail suddenly comes under some compulsion or it will require fatal practice

 India's middle-order leading batsman VVS Laxman is confident that his number one team will make a strong comeback in the four-test series against England
 in donon tiimon ke bich doosraa test match shuukravaar se shuru hoga
 India lost the first Test match played at Lord's by a big margin of 196 runs but Laxman said that it would not affect the team whose image is not shown to do well in the first match of the series
 lakshmana ne ‘daily telegraph’ se kaha, ‘hamaare main vaapasi karne kii kshamta he or hamane pehle bhi aisa kiya he
 The middle-order batsman gave an example of a series played in South Africa last year where India made a series comeback after losing the first Test at Centurion
 unhone kaha, ‘ham dakshin africa ke khilaaf centurian main buree tarah haar gayi the lekin shandaar vaapasi karke dakshin africa sarajameen par pehali baar shrinkhalaa baraabar karwaane main safal rahe
 India lost by an innings and 25 runs at Centurion but in Durban they won by 87 runs
 bharat teesraa match bhi jeetne kii sthiti main tha lekin jaak kallis kii shandaar pari se dakshin africa yah match bachaane main safal rahaa tha
 India has again come into a similar position against England
 abhi us par england ke tej gendbaaj haaavee hai lekin lakshmana videshi akraman ko lekar kisi tarah se chintit nahin hai
 He said, 'I don't want to give too much importance to the way England bowlers bowled
 unhone keval achche aria main gend kii
 He got wickets
 yah aisa bejod gendbaaji akraman nahin he jo hamaari ballebaaji ko tahas nahas kar de
 "laxman said," If he had stopped us for less than 150 runs in both innings, i would have accepted that he destroyed our batting
 ’is hyderaabadi ballebaaj ne sweekaar kiya mukhya gendbaaj jahir khan kii anupasthiti team ko baari padi jo mansapeshiyon main khinchaav ke kaaran lords test main keval 13
 He could bowl only 3 overs
 lakshmana ne kaha, ‘mukhya antar 150, 120 ran kaa rahaa jo hamane england ko diye or yah jahir khan kii anupasthiti kii vajah se hua
 If we had a third regular fast bowler like Zaheer, then the result would have been different
 ’bharat kii taraf se kai yaadgaar paariyaan khilne vaale lakshmana ne kaha, ‘hamane duusari pari main unke paanch wicket 65 ran par nikaal diye the
 We chased the target of 260-280 runs by dismissing them and we would have easily achieved this goal
 ’ lakshmana ne us match ko yaad karte hue kaha, ‘eemaandaaree se kahuun to jab tisare din kii shaam ko jab steve ne hamen phaloan ke liye kaha, to (sadagopan) ramesh or (shivasundar) das ke bich pehle wicket kii saajhedaari ne hamaare liye acchhee neenv rakhi
 "he said," and when i came out to bat on the evening of the third day, i didn't think of turning the dice in the Test match

 In a survey conducted separately by industry chamber FICCI and PHD Chamber, most Indian companies said that there is positive thinking among the industrial houses and they are expecting better business conditions which will increase sales and also increase profit margins
 fikki ne apane vyavsaayik vishwaas survey main kaha ki zyaadaatar companiyaan agali timahi ko lekar ashavan hai or unhen ummid he ki sarkaar aagaamee bajet main aarthik vruddhi ko protsaahit karne ke upayon kii ghoshnaa karegi
 FICCI President Naina Lal Kidwai said, "although the economic situation remains difficult and business sentiment remains weak, we expect the situation to improve in the next quarter
 ’isi tarah ke vichaar vyakt karte hue piechdi chembar ne apane adhyayan main kaha ki desh main dirghakaal main kaarobaari sambhaavnaaen behatar najar aati he kyonki zyaadaatar companiyon ne agle teen saalon main apane kaarobaar kaa vistaar karne kii yojana banaai he
 The phd said that effective policy interventions and reformist measures would open the way for heavy investment for companies
 piechdi chembar ke adhyaksh suman jyoti khatan ne kaha, ‘behatar nitiyon vaala parivesh uplabdh karaane or niveshkon ko bharosa dilaane ke liye yah sabase acha mauka he jisamen nai pariyojnaon, nitiyon, utpaadon or bhagidaari ke liye nai sambhaavnaaon ke dwaara kholane kaa vaada kiya janaa chaiye
 In both the surveys, the Reserve Bank's recent move to reduce policy rates was seen as conducive to improving investor sentiment and hoped that this would boost investment in the near future
 duusari baar pradhanmantri pad kii shapath lene ke baad narendra modi sabase pehle maldive kii yatra par ja sakate hai
 This could be his first bilateral visit when he came to power after the Lok Sabha elections
 rajanyik sutron or maldive media kii report se yah jaankaree mili he
 Let me tell you that when Narendra Modi became the PM in 2014, he went to Bhutan for the first time
 rajanyik sutron ne bataaya ki narendra modi june ke pehle pakhwaade main maldive kii rajdhani maale kii yatra par ja sakate hai
 If you believe the media reports of Maldives, then Narendra Modi's visit may be on 7-8 June
 bataa den ki videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj isi saal march main maldive kii yatra par gai thim
 Sushma Swaraj's visit to Maldives was the first bilateral visit since the formation of the government of President Ibrahim Mohammed Solih in November last year
 haalanki pichley saal november main jab ibrahim mohammad solih shapath le rahe the to narendra modi bhi is kaarykram main shirkat karne gaye the
 On 23 May, when PM Narendra Modi won the election, Solih congratulated him
 maldive ke purv raashtrapati mohammad nashid ne bhi piem ke jeet par unhen badhai or kaha tha ki bharat or maldive shanti, vikaas or samruddhi ke saajha mulyon ko saath lekar chalenge
 Thank You @ ibusolihfor your warm wishes
 India greatly values its relations with Maldives
 i look forward to working closely with you to further strengthen our multifaceted partnership

 haalanki donon deshon ke sambandhon main khatas tab ai jab pichley saal farvari main tatkaaleen raashtrapati abdulla yamin ne desh main apatkaal kii ghoshnaa kar di
 With this, many leaders working as supporters of India were arrested
 tab bharat ne is faisle kii aalochana kii thi
 India said that the Maldives government should respect the ethics of the electoral process and release political prisoners

 After spending a long time in love, if both of you are thinking about getting married now, then there is no better thing than this
 lekin jitna aasaan ye bolne or sunne main lag rahaa he kya itnaa iji ye sachmuch main bhi hoga
 Marrying your choice today is no less than a tuff task because no parent wants their child to choose his or her choice in matters like marriage
 isliye apane parantus ko apane partner se milwane se pehle or shaadi kii baat karne se pehle kuch jaruri kaa dhyaan rakhana bahut jaruri he
 Keeping these important things in mind, there can be some ease in this way of accepting family members
 1
 Tell the person who is closest to you in the family about this, like, many people are very close to their brother or sister, then some people make your sister-in-law their ruler
 agar aapke saath bhi aisa kuch he to pehle apane us family member se raay mashwara kar len taaki vah aapke parents ko raji karne main aapaki madad kar sake
 2
 agar aap shaadi karne kaa puraa man bana chuke hai to samay-samay par apane parents ke saamne aisi kuch-kuch baaten karte rahen taaki unhen aapke man kii baat pataa chalati rahe
 3
 partner ko apneparents se pehle ek achche dostki tarah hi milawaayen taaki vah aapke gharavaalon ke saath thodaa ghulmil jaae
 While doing this, keep in mind that during this time, you should also share every important thing with partner and family so that bonding can be formed between them
 4
 Whenever you get a chance, keep talking about that good friend of yours
 5
 It is very important to maintain patience because sometimes your parents can ignore you even by understanding you
 aise main har sambhav koshish karke unhen apni baat samajhane kaa prayaas karte rahen
 6
 ab jab aap apane partner ke bare main ghar par sabakuch bataa chuke hai togharavaalon ko apane patarneraki acchhee baton ke bare main bataaen kyonki rang rup or jaatpaat aaj bhi gharon main apni jaden rakhata he
 For any family, the marriage of their child is an emotional decision they want to make
 isliye unki bhaawanaaon kaa khyaal rakhana bhi aapaki jimmedaari he
 7
 jab bhi ghar par lav marij ko lekar bahes ho to kuch acchhee or safal shaadiyon ke udhaaharan pesh karnaa na bhoolen

 We were outside the Sankatmochan temple
 ye vahi mandir he, jo serial bam blast ke chalate khabaron main tha
 The security cover is that the phone and the bag are stored on the outside counter, but the security inside is responsible for the person wearing a blue shirt uniform, the cloaky dumku chacha
 yani sab kuch vaaki ram or hanuman bharose he abhi bhi
 Asked a policeman about this, he said
 bhaiya ram ji rakhaate hai
 However, this Banaras seat has become the most special for the BJP, who is allegedly trading Ram ji

 He told one more thing about the address

 Till date some candidate has come
 ye sab ke sab congressi hi rahe
 But now they are also going right left
 jaaie kanpur joshi ji
 
 
 i hear this and the next time i look at the wall, Murali Manohar Joshi is seen wishing Holi
 ye vahi joshi hai, jinhone suna he ek baar bayaan diya tha ki saansad kaa kaam naalee khauunje banvaanaa nahin, kshetra kii sansad main shaan badhanaa he
 The issues of the country have to be debated
 joshi ji vidwaan rajaneta hai
 And Banaras is a scholar, but not an eagle, he dies on the floor
 so unhen meri ek bin maangi salaah
 You will not be able to do it
 aap to seat badal hi len
 Otherwise, in 2004, Allahabad may be Harakiri
 jaaie kanpur, modi lahar par savaar ho
 If won, then the Lok Sabha will also be seen and the two-time cabinet minister and the hat-trick of victory will also get to defeat Sriprakash Jaiswal
 
 
 
 So Lalkak will make roads, Modi returns to Benaras
 abaki mukhamakham ho rahaa he auto vaale ke sahyogi se
 We had already embarked on the journey that the auto stopped five hundred meters ahead and a gentleman shrugged and sat down next to the driver
 munh main paan dabaa
 If Delhi were there, i would be very scared
 wo aamir khan vaala auto aid yaad karke
 It turned out that these are also auto aage tak janaa he
 Who will you vote for? to bole modi ko
 Why tehre
 Smiled
 ek duusare kii taraf donon ne dekha
 Some were turned up
 goyaa puch liya ho
 Why love with a friend phir bole
 Brother, you are watching these roads
 ukhdi padi hai
 It is a bad situation
 tempo chalaane main
 So will Modi make roads? haa bhaiya banavaa denge na
 My brother-in-law is a boy
 surat main bataashe(padhein golgappa) bechata he
 Was telling that there are lakalak roads there
 or un par raat bhar batti (lite) bhi jalati rahati he
 So, he sells a lot
 ganga ko bachaana he to modi ko laana hamodi jeeten-haaren laden yaa na laden
 It is a very true truth of Banaras that the roads here are very bad
 jahaan dekhie khuda padaa he
 Alam is that the red-hat home guards at the crossroads also wear masks like the Japanese on the mouth, so that their beauty is not lost
 or masalaa sirf sadak kaa hi nahin
 He is also the one, who was mentioned in the Banaras rally by the current BJP general
 ganga ke pradooshan kaa
 From the paved bridge to Assi Ghat, the water still looks like something green
 magar phir rajghat tak pahunchate pahunchate kaashi kii ye ganga kaali si hone lagati he
 And believe me, this has not happened with the ashes of the pyre burning on Manikarnika or Harishchandra Ghat
 banaras ko bachaana he, to ganga ko bachaana hi hoga
 And this work will not be just one place
 pahaad se shuru hoga
 But the field will have to worry more
 kyonki vahiin zyada mel daalaa jaataa he kai kism kaa is dhara main
 Bablu Nishad sharpened his understanding on the Ganges
 unhone kaha ki bhaiya, ham kya karen
 Everyone has to go quickly to the other side
 phir lautakar dashashwamedh kii aarti bhi dekhni he
 Forced, all paddle boats had to be removed and fitted with a diesel pumping set
 ab dikkat ye he ki unki roji to chal rahi he
 But the pollution of oil in the Ganges is constantly slipping
 bablu vot ke sawaal par sahi chot karte hai
 According to them brother, we do not mind
 na saamne ghat kii diwaar ko padataa he
 It is just a matter of difference
 hamaari nahin badalati
 He is changed in every election
 nae nae naam aa jate hai
 Slogans are taken with new photos
 dilli main baithe raajnneetishastri chahen to iske aadhaar par bhi ek siddhant baghaar sakate hai
 But it is really painful that the man standing at the end of the society has almost lost hope
 haal pichley chunaav kaa
 
 
 However, it was being talked about the election of Benares
 chaowkee par ek chhutbhaiye or philhal berozegaar netaa ne or gyaan baghaar diya
 Said, Brother brother, if Modi comes, it will be fine
 magar netaa to ajay raay he
 The election was done last time
 magar ye khaaki vaale aakhri main hindu muslim kara die
 It seems to us that by giving money, we should fight Mukhtar from here
 varna joshi to gaye the
 So to understand this statement of friends leader, let us also have some past philosophy
 banaras bhale hi santon asanton or ghonghabasanton kii nagari rahaa ho
 Even though the socialist, Congress and leftist, all the monasteries are adorned
 magar ram lahar ke baad se khilaa camel hi he
 Shish Chandra Dixit became MP in 91 followed by Shankar Prasad Jaiswal three times in 96,98 and 99
 2004 main kuch sameekaran badale or congress dow
 Rajesh Mishra wins
 magar 5 saal baad hi banaras phir bhagava ho gaya
 This is the condition of the same previous election
 2004 main elahabaad kaa chunaav sapa ke kunwar revati raman singh ke haathon haarane ke baad joshi banaras aae the
 But here, bjp's popular MLA Ajay Rai was claiming
 alaakaman ke saamne jab raay kii nahin chali to vah saaikal par savaar ho gaye
 Three straight and a total of five angles were made directly
 ajay raay ne ek morcha sambhala, to bispi ke hathi par savaar bahubali mukhtaar ansaari ne doosraa
 And as mentioned earlier
 assi ghat ke chaay vaale bhi bataate hai ki aakhir main to bas hindu muslim ho gaya
 It is said that this polarization saved Joshi's shame
 dephending saansad misir khet to rahe hi, chauthi par ja gire
 Vijay Prakash Jaiswal of Apna Dal, who is emerging in this area, got only four hundred votes less than him
 haar jeet kii baat karen to joshi lagbhag 17 hajaar vot se jite
 Mukhtar gave a tough fight
 ajay raay bhi aakhir tak dam saadhe rahe or sava lakh vot ke saath tisare par rahe
 Polarization is the ultimate truth of elections
 
 
 ab sawaal uthta he ki is ateet puraana ko philhal baanchane kaa kya matlab
 it means
 isse hamaare aapke jaise logon ko kuch pech samaj aa sakate hai
 The first is that even if you do not see the smell of communalism in the everyday life of Benares, religious behavior has become a normal practice here
 magar dhruvikaran hi chunaav kaa antim satya he yahaan par
 Second, the nexus between Muslims and Dalits proves to be deadly
 varna mukhtaar ansaari ko sirf dabangai ke dam par to itane vot na milte
 There are also a good number of Bhumihars and Rajputs and Jaiswal is also powerful in the same way
 ’‘pandit ji har jagah kii tarah pehle congressi the, phir bhaajapai hue or ab sattai ho gaye hai
 Meaning that they too are beginning to sense the wind like clever Sujan
 ’ ye pandit ji vaala gyaan hamen biechayu ke ravidaas get par bani mashhoor keshav kii paan dukaan ke baahar ek sarkari babu ne diya
 So the point is that if Modi contests the election, then there are two contenders from the Congress
 ek to rajesh mishra, jinhone rahul gandhi ke haalia daure ke dauraan apni rahul bhaiya ke saath khub hording tangvaayin shahar main
 The other is Ajay Rai, who is now strengthening his hands off the cycle
 magar raay pichhlaa pradarshan doharaa paaenge, ise lekar banarsi ab shaq jaahir karte hai
 He says that Joshi was mild
 modi vajani hai
 And one thing is also that a large area with influence area of ajay Rai has now moved to the Machilishar parliamentary seat after delimitation
 tisare daavedaar hai mukhtaar ansaari
 Currently, his wife Afsa Ansari is a candidate from the Kaumi Ekta Dal
 magar mukhtaar ne kal hi elaan kiya ki gar modi lade to ham bhi hai maidan main
 There is also a discussion that Ansari's party will be merged with the SP and be given a bicycle ride
 philhal kii baat karen to netaa ji kii cycle se pedal maar rahe hai kailash chaurasia
 By the way, he is an MLA from neighboring Mirzapur on a SP ticket
 magar netaa ji ke tamaam vyavsaayik hit banaras main hai
 Lrabra Mahafalbaz said such a thing
 bataaya ye bhi gaya ki chaurasia ji bhi jaaenge
 As Surendra Patel went
 ye sajjan pehle banaras se sapa candidet the
 Then came Kailash
 basapa kaa candidet abhi jaahir nahin hua
 Anyway, someone has said a lot
 basapa kaa ek hi candidet hota he
 Sister Mayawati
 baaki to sab dami he
 Well, this can be his own opinion
 basapa main tamaam dhurandhar hai, magar banaras se koun ladega, ye to bahan ji hi tay karengi
 Or in the words of Akhilesh Yadav, aunt
 naam ek jaiswal ji kaa chal rahaa he, jo mashhoor sharaab kaarobaari jawahar jaiswal ke khaas bataae jate hai
 Trade Marble and have been knocked out in the mayor's election
 
 
 
 So, we cannot win without jugaad, while running, we were told by a journalist of a big newspaper on the phone
 dekho bhaiya, banaras main bina baahubal or dhanabal ke sambhav nahin he
 Now look at the last election of Joshi ji
 kai kaarobaariyon kii pratishtha bhi lagi thi usamen
 So everything was set
 ab ihaan chunaav narendra modi bhi ladenge to bhi muqabla ansaari se hi hoga
 Meaning that Muslim vs Hindu will remain the case
 musalmaan ekamusth kisi muslim candidet ko hi vot degaa
 and one more thing
 abhi jo candidet dikh rahe hai, sab hawa ho sakate hai
 All the mathematics is set on Modi's mathematics
 modi ke liye hi mulaayam singh ne sari bisaat bichaai he
 The SP also has to show that we are the leaders of Muslims
 isliye partiyon ne jo utaara he, badla ja saktaa he
 Now see you
 kisi ko kaanon kaan khabar nahin hui or phulpur main caff ko utaar diya congress ne
 Add an interrupter to this paper
 ye hamako sarnath ke baahar car kii steering par pair tikaae ek thekedaar numa lekin sahitya padhe guru ne bataaya
 Applying Banaras to the Center will be no less difficult than taking over the reins of the Center on Raisina Hills
 shahar gat vaibhav or aaayaatit aagat ke bich atka hua he
 One end of it goes to the Satyuga, the reach of the other end is yet to be decided by Benares
 kehete hai gapbaaj kii pehle tay kar le naapega koun, tab ye bhi dekh liya jayega ki chor pahunchaa kahaan tak
 At present, Banaras is dumpling the pan under the molar with the kamam-yolk and Magahi leaves
 is intjaar main ki dekhen koun sasur aate hai or kya gul khilaate hai
 This is Banaras
 bhasma or aarti se bana shahar
 The city of Kabir and Tulsi in unison
 ret ganga or railway ingine kaarkaane kaa shahar
 And now maybe Modi's city too
 bharat main bullate train shuru karne kii disha main kadam badhaate hue railway ne mumbai or ahmedabad ke bich hai speed train pariyojna ke kriyanvayan ke liye ek vishesh company (espivi) sthapit kii he

 isisi ne team india ke wicketiper mahendra singh dhoni se apane dastaane se 'balidaan baij' kaa nishaan hataane ko kaha he
 Indian cricket fans are extremely angry with this ICC decree
 bhartiya cricket phens khulkar dhoni ke samarthan main utar aae hai
 Dhoni, an honorary lieutenant colonel rank officer in the Territorial Army, wore gloves in the World Cup match against South Africa, wearing a 'sacrifice badge'
 ICC kaa farmaan, dhoni ko gloves se hataanaa hoga sena ke sammaan kaa nishandhoni ke is kadam se cricket phens ne unki jamkar prashansa kii thi
 But the ICC did not like Dhoni's move
 ICC ne ise apwaad bataate hue kaha ki yah uske niyamon ke khilaaf he
 Not only this, the former Indian captain can also be fined for violating ICC rules
 isisi ke nirdesh se khafa bhartiya cricket phens ne soshal media par jamkar apni bhadaas nikaali
 There are many fans who are explaining why Dhoni should be allowed to express his love for the Indian Army
 ek prashansak ne likhaa ki balidaan baij kisi dharm, raajnneetik chihn se judaa hua nahin he
 Dhoni has every right to do so
 mujhe aisa koi kaaran nahin dikhataa ki isisi ko isamen hastkshep karnaa pade
 Explain that according to ICC rules, no cricketer can use religious, ethnic and political logos
 bhartiya sena ke prati dhoni kaa prem kisi se chipa nahin he
 Before the World Cup, in the home series against Australia, the players of Team India had landed in the army wearing a special cap
 bhartiya khilaadiyon ne pulavama hamale main shahid hue siarpief ke javaanon kii yaad main aisa kiya tha
 It is believed that Dhoni gave the idea of paying tribute to the soldiers to the BCCI
 unhone saathi khilaadiyon ko cap pradaan kiya tha
 Even then the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had opposed it and demanded the ICC to take action against India
 lekin pisibi kii is maang ko isisi se thukraa diya tha
 The BCCI had already allowed players from ICC to wear specially designed caps for this

 This is big towing
 shaayad in jumalon ko sunakar aapako kuch yaad aae
 Yes, these are the jumleas that have redefined the Indian hosiery industry and pushed the traditional and sloppy attitude of Indian society, especially the middle class, towards being stylish, yet these garments Was keeping himself away from Mohapash for many reasons
 aaj jitna mahatv stylish dresses rakhti hai, utana hi unke neeche pahane jane vaale innervier kaa bhi he
 That's why Abhishek from Delhi, who is going to college, says, "first of all, wear anything and walk

 "of course Bollywood's hand is seen with vigor in taking the vest to this point
 iskaa andaja dollar industries ke emdi vinod gupta kii is baat se hota he, ''vitt varsh 2009-10 main hamaara turnover 293 karod ru

 The first condition is to be cheap and durable
 bas aam aadmi kii isi jarurat ko nishaanaa banane ke liye haujri industry usee ke hero kaa istemaal kar rahi he
 Ad guru Prahlad Kakkar says about this trend, "five-six years ago, Bollywood stars were not used in innerwear advertisements
 lekin jab hojiri industry ne dekha ki pepsy jaisi companiyaan inke jariye apane brands ko sthapit kar rahi hai to unhone bhi in sitaron kaa daaman tham liya
 "he is quite right to say that
 bollywood ke in sitaron main akshay kumaar, shahrukh khan, sani deol, saf ali khan or salmaan khan pramukh hai
 The special thing is that the name of Akshay's next film is similar to his brand Slogan: Boss
 ve dollar industry ke innervier ke brands ambeseder hai or feet he bos unka jumala he
 While Dabangg Salman Khan is the brand ambassador of the Dixie Scott Company, Lux has chosen actors based on their brands, which includes Sunny Deol, Shah Rukh Khan and Neil Nitin Mukesh
 bollywood stars ko innervier ke vigyapanon main liye jane ke bare main lucks innervier ke emdi pradeep todi kehete hai, ''khiladinnon kii lokapriyata sthir nahin he
 But this is not the case with film stars
 unki 2-3 filmein na bhi chalem to unke chaahane vaale aasaani se nahin tuutate
 Therefore, film stars remain the first choice in these advertisements
 ”sitaron kii brands vailu khiladinnon se zyada hoti he tabhi to salmaan, shahrukh or ahnay lambey samay se bollywood main jame hue hai
 Kakkar says, "there is a tremendous fan following in all areas, big and small
 yahi vajah he ki in sitaron ko brands ambeseder banane kaa asar in companiyon kii kamai par bhi dikh rahaa he kyonki hamaara dress ap filmon se kaaphi prerit hota he
 "amul Innerwear director Sandeep Saxaria also accepts this," The actor's popularity has a lot of impact
 hamen saf ke saath jude teen saal ho chuke hai or amul maacho ke bijness main 100 fisadi kaa ijapha darj hua he
 “indian hosiery is still focused on the men's market
 jahaan tak vigyapanon kii baat he to haujri industry kaa maananaa he ki lingeri aid aam taur par tivi par najar nahin aate
 The reason for this may also be the Indian mentality, but these companies have made strides in women's products
 dollar industries ke emdi vinod gupta kehete hai, ''hamaare paas vuman products ke liye misi brands he
 Talking of an exception, Lux Acterno featured TV actress Aamna Sharif, while Sana Khan stirred up Amul Macho's Yeh Bada Towing

 New brands are coming in the market, so the brands like Swagat and TT are still intact and they are experimenting with time by experimenting in their products

 Targeting the central government on the issue of black money, Yogguru Baba Ramdev said on Thursday that Manmohan Singh is a forced Prime Minister, as there is a lot of unscrupulous people around him
 elahabaad main samvaadadaata sammelan main baba ramdev ne kaha, 'ek hota he majboot pradhanmantri or ek hota he majaboor pradhanmantri
 The Prime Minister of our country is very honest personally but he has been forced, by the unscrupulous people who surround him
 'ramdev ne kaha ki yahi kram jari rahaa to lagata he ki sansad kaa aglaa satr tihaad jail main karnaa padegaa
 He said that he would soon write a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to take concrete steps to bring back the black money stashed abroad

 Along with demonetisation, now its side effects are also coming out, the biggest concern with cashless payment is the transaction fees associated with it
 kaarobaari se lekar khariddaar tak isi charge ko lekar pareshaan hai ki kaise or kitna logon ko card se khariddaari ke liye chukaana hoga
 But the problem is most of the shopkeepers because they have to obey the government and convince the customers
 dilli ke dil conot place ke kai dukaanon main in dinon sannata pasra hua he, notebandi ke baad se aam janata debit yaa credit card se bhugtan karne ke liye majaboor he
 There are many benefits of card payment, but now its disadvantages are also coming
 card tranjection ke dauraan bainkon kii taraf se liye ja rahe tranjaction fees or kai baar pioes mashin se hui asuvidha ke kaaran ab log iske istemaal se kataraane lage hai
 After demonetisation, the government is continuously promoting cashless payments, but the biggest concern related to this is transaction fees
 kaarobaariyon ke saath saath graahak bhi isse pareshaan hai
 Different transaction fees are collected from each bank
 halaat ye he ki graahak card se bhugtan karne se pehle ab lag rahe atirikt shulk kii jaankaree lete he or kai baar saamaan liye bagaiyr hi laut jate he
 Customers say that earlier they were forced into cashless transactions and now they are being charged arbitrary transaction fees
 The government ordered not to charge 2% on credit card transactions after demonetisation
 kuch bainkon ne bhugtan ke liye caudit card ke istemaal par dobaratranjectionshulk vasuulana shuru kar diya he, aise main pehle se hi mahangaai kii maar jhel rahaa aam aadmi ab card se bhugtan ke liye kataraata phir rahaa he
 The market has been lost from the markets buzzing with customers, banks have decided to increase the 1% levy on payments from Point of Sale (POS) to shopkeepers and customers as well as petrol pump owners
 jisko lekar naaraaz association ne debit or credit card se penment nahi lene kaa faisla liya tha haalanki sarkaar ne maamle par bharosa dilaayaa to petrol pump maalik 13 janvari tak card se pement lene ko maan to gaye hai
 But Mandeep Bhullar, who runs his petrol pump at the same Connaught Place, believes that if he is charged a 1% levy on the card payment, then he will suffer a huge loss
 kya he emdiar ?emdiar kaa matlab marchet discount rate hota he, jab bhi koi vyakti kisi dukaan se koi saamaan kharidta he or pioes mashin par card se bhugtan karata he to dukandaar par yah charge lagata he
 The government has been promoting cashless payments since the announcement of demonetisation, even during which the government ordered banks not to charge 2% on credit card transactions
 kuch bainkon ne bhugtan ke liye debit card ke istemaal par dobaaraa tranjection shulk vasuulana shuru kar diya he
 Due to no clear instructions from the government and the Reserve Bank, they have restored the old system, which is directly impacting the shopkeepers and the common man

 kuch yahi kar dikhaaya he bihar ke jamui jile ke jhaasa ke rahane vaale naveen prakaash ne
 Born in a middle class family in Jhajha's Barajod, Naveen Prakash has made it to 'bigg Boss-10' due to his ability
 bacchon kii class lene vaale vaale naveen prakaash ab 16 oktober se colors par shuru hone vaale 'big bos' sijan 10 main salmaan khan kii paathshaala main najar aaenge
 Season 10 of the show 'bigg Boss', which is always in the headlines due to different characters, includes people from all walks of life and in this one Bihari teacher is also going to enhance the beauty of Bigg Boss
 jise aap or ham 16 oktober se chote parde par dekh sakenge
 Naveen Prakash is the eldest son of farmer Surendra Yadav and Aarti Yadav from Jhajha's Barjod occupation
 naveen kii primary ajukeshan to jhaasa se hui lekin metric kendriya vidhyalay jamalpur or inter kii pariksha naveen ne diavi, bokaro se paas kii
 Naveen Prakash then moved to Delhi for higher education
 naveen prakaash neupiescemen hue CSAT ke andolan main agrani bhoomika nibhaai
 Naveen's identity has since become a student leader
 is andolan main naveen ne bataaya tha ki kis tarah nayaa pattern gaanvon main pard rahe bacchon ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he or vaise chaatr jo english main zyada achche nahin hai unke liye yah ek pareshaani ban saktaa he
 Naveen made more headlines after an English channel participated in the debate
 naveen prakaash padhane likhane ke alaava gaanaa gane ke bhi behad shaukeen hai
 Naveen, who lives in a very poor family and small village Barjod, got a big platform only after moving to Delhi
 naveen kaa chota bhai rakesh bisie kar chukaa he, vahiin bahan sangeeta bhagalpur vishvavidhyalay se hindi main piji kar rahi he
 Naveen's mother Aarti Yadav looks after the housework
 naveen 'big bos-10' main dikhaai dene vaale hai, is baat kaa pataa unke gharavaalon ko tab chalaa jababig boski team naveen ko lekar 6 oktober ko uske gaanv pahunchi
 Naveen's parents and brothers are very happy about this
 naveen ke pita surendra yadav kaa kahana he ki unhen katai is baat kaa andaja nahin tha ki is chote se gaanv kaa rahane vaala unka betaa ek din itane bade plateform par jayega or bihar kaa naam roshan karegaa
 'bigg Boss-10' is starting from 16 October
 naveen ke gharavaale bhi isse kaaphi khush hai lekin wo apane bete ko kaise chote parde par dekhenge iskaa malaal naveen ke parivaar ko andar hi andar sata rahaa he
 Naveen's house does not even have a TV on which his entire family can watch him
 ek chota sa tivi he wo bhi kharaab padaa hua he
 Naveen's younger brother Rakesh says that he will go to someone's house or watch Naveen's performance on youtube
 karnataka main congress or bhaajapa ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaaron ne jamkar bayaanbaji kii
 He was not used to running political tricks neither from here nor from there
 siddharmaiya ne chunaav prachaar ke aakhir main dalit card chalaa to yediurppa ne bina samay ganvaae nattejey aane ke baad bahutam na milane par bhi rajyapal se mulaakaat karne main jaraa si bhi deree nahin kii
 Overall, both are arrogant in the political world
 lekin agar baat abhaasi duniya kii baat karen to yediurppa achche numberon se paas hote dikhte hai or siddharmaiya ko thodi or mehtan karne kii jarurat he
 Karnataka results have come
 sarkaar banane ke liye raajnneetik uthapatak shuru ho chuki he
 The Congress immediately approached the JDS, taking lessons from the mistake made during the Manipur and Goa elections
 lekin sarkaar banane main maahir narendra modi kii bhaajapa ne turant apni chaal chali
 Now the entire barrage rests on the Governor
 yediurppa ne bina deree kiye rajyapal se mulaakaat kar bahumat sabit karne ke liye 48 ghante kaa samay maanga he
 However, the power of Karnataka is necessary for both Congress and BJP
 siddharmaiya ne matdaan se thik pehle dalit card chalakar bhaajapa ke bheetar bhay paidaa karne kii koshish kii
 He said, if we win then a Dalit can be made the Chief Minister
 isse unhen koi dikkat nahin hogi
 The Congress had already surprised the BJP by giving Lingayat the status of religion
 congress ke siddharmaiya or bhaajapa ke yediurppa donon chust durust dikhe
 But talking about the report cards of both the leaders on social media, Yeddyurappa will be seen winning
 fasebuk main yediurppa aage or siddharmaiya pichhefesbuk par siddharmaiya ke hai, ek lakh churaasi hajaar like to folover ek lakh chhiyaasi hajaar aath sau baawan
 While Yeddyurappa has 17 lakh seventy three thousand eight hundred and thirty six likes and 17 lakh seventy three thousand six hundred and three followers
 twitor main bhi yahi halbhajaap ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar yediurppa ne yah khabar likhane ke chaar ghante pehle twit kiya tha jabaki siddharmaiya ke twitor handle se aakhri twit 8 may ko kiya gaya tha
 Siddaramaiah has so far followed one lakh 68 tweets to 71 people and 1,59 thousand people follow them
 like sirf 15, yediurppa yahaan bhi aage hai
 Tweeted 40512 so far
 ek sau chhiyaalis logon ko follow karte hai
 286 thousand people follow them
 like 829
 Actually, the reason for the BJP leaders being agile on social media is the decree of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he said
 soshal media par sabhi netaaon kii na keval upasthiti jaruri he balki acchhee khaasi sankhya main folover hone chahie
 Not only this, daily activism is also necessary

 This is published directly from Syndicate Feed) (NDTV team has not edited this news
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) The Chhattisgarh Government has decided to set up a new study team by rejecting the report of the former government's study team on prohibition of alcohol

 Akbar said that the Council of Ministers has decided to dismiss the report of the then 11-member study team of the commercial-tax (excise) Department regarding liquor ban as impractical and set up a new study team
 mantri ne bataaya ki naveen adhyayan dal ke dwaara rajya sarkaar ko do maah ke bheetar apni report di jaaegi
 Akbar said that the former government had formed an 11-member study team
 is dal main saansad, vidhayak, aabkaari vibhaag ke adhikari or saamaajik kaaryakarta the
 The team visited different states
 unhone bataaya ki adhyayan dal ne anushansa kii thi ki chhattisgarh rajya kii simaaen madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, jharkhand, maharashtra, telugana, odisha or andhrapradesh se judati he
 Alcohol prohibition is not applicable in all these states
 isliye rajya main adivasee bahulya kshetron ke reeti rivaaj va padosi rajyon kii sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhkar hi aabkaari niti kaa nirdhaaran kiya janaa chahie
 The committee has recommended that after studying the excise policy of various states, the committee has come to the conclusion that it is not appropriate to fully adopt the policy of any state

 New Zealand captain Brendon mccullum once again appeared in his familiar style while playing his last ODI in Hamilton
 australia ne toss jitkar newjiland ko ballebaaji ke liye bulaayaa
 But by the time mccullum was on the pitch, Steve Smith must have felt for a moment that he had made a big mistake as mccullum played at a strike rate of 175
 apni 27 gendon kii pari ke dauraan unhone chah chauke or teen chakke jade or 47 ran banaae
 When he was out on the third ball of the 10th over, New Zealand's score was 84 runs, that is, an average of more than 8
 kul milakar maikulam ne cricket ko apane jane pahachaane andaaj main alavida kaha, lekin newjiland ke baaki cricketer aisa pradarshan nahin kar sake or puri team 246 ran par simat gai
 However Martin Guptillan scored 59 runs and Grant Elliott played a half-century innings of 50 runs
 newjiland kii team vishaal score banane kii ore bad rahi thi tabhi 14 gend main nau ran ke andar antim paanch wicket gir gaye or pari 46wein over main hi khatm ho gai
 New Zealand and Australia are tied at 1-1 in the three-match ODI series
 maikulam apane shandaar vanade kariyar kaa ant vijeta team banakar karnaa chaahate hai
 mccullum received a 'guard of Honor' from Australia when he landed
 jab vah maidan se baahar gaye to 6,000 darshak unke liye khadey hokar taaliyaan bajaane lage
 mccullum, who was included in the ODI Cricket Club's 'big Hitter', also completed 200 sixes in his ODI career during this 260th match
 is list main pakistan ke shahid afridi 351 chhakkon ke saath top par hai jabaki maikulam chauthe sthaan par
 At number two is Sri Lankan batsman Sanath Jayasuriya with 270 sixes while in third place is 'storm' Chris Gayle of West Indies with 238 sixes
 in chaar cricketrs ke alaava or kisi ballebaaj ne vanade main 200 chakke nahin jade hai
 Among the current players, South African cricketer AB de Villiers is fast moving towards joining this club
 unhone ab tak 182 chakke jade hai
 While India's ODI captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni needs only 8 more sixes to join this club
 test main sixsar king banenge maikulamatest maichon main 34 varshiya maikulam 100 chhakkon ke world ricard main sanyas le chuke australian khilaadi adam gilcrist ke saath barabari par hai

 congress sahit argedy, jithan ram maanjhi kii hindustan avam morcha (ham)or sharad yadav kii loktantric janata dal pehle hi mahagathbandhan main shaamil ho chuki thim
 Both leaders welcomed Kushwaha

 This is the reason why they have decided to come with the Grand Alliance
 yah khushi kaa vishay he ki upendra kushvaha mahagathbandhan main shaamil ho rahe hai
 At the same time, Kushwaha said that on the one hand i was being insulted in the NDA, on the other hand, Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Lalu Prasad Yadav showed generosity, this was the reason for joining the Grand Alliance
 unhone kaha ki nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke saath milakar hamaari party ko kamjor karne kaa kaam kiya
 Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Kushwaha said that in every Lok Sabha meeting of Bihar in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi used to say that people of Bihar will not have to go out for education, medicine and earning
 lekin chaar saal baad halaat jas ke tas hai
 All three promises have not been fulfilled
 bihar ke logon ko aaj bhi padhai, dawaai or kamai ke liye bihar se baahar janaa pad rahaa he
 During this, Kushwaha strongly praised Congress President Rahul Gandhi and said that Rahul Gandhi has always talked about farmers
 congress ne kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar ye sabit kar diya he ki unki kathani or kerani main fark nahin he
 Rahul Gandhi has fulfilled his promise ranging from land acquisition to farmers' loan waiver
 desh main unka vishwaas badha he
 Kushwaha said that Nitish Kumar also insulted me by calling me a neech
 2 farvari ko patna main ham andolan karenge
 Education reform will be our first demand
 paanch sutreey kaarykram kii maang bhi ham karenge
 We do not trust them, but even if the Chief Minister is them, we will make this demand from them only
 argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne piem modi ko taanashaah bataate hue kaha ki unki nitiyon se unke sahyogi bhi saath chhodkar alag ho rahe hai
 He said that the NDA has done the job of losing its alliance partners everywhere
 upi se lekar maharashtra tak har jagah bijepi se saathi naaraaz hai
 Tejashwi said that thank you very much to our party and Rahul Gandhi along with our leader Lalu Yadav
 lalu yadav ne hi mahagathbandhan kaa formula shuru kiya tha
 Now the discussion of forming a grand alliance at the national level has started
 tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki yah janata ke dilon kaa gathbandhan he
 It is a fight to save the country
 yah ladaai unke khilaaf he jinhone janata ko sirf dhokhaa dene kaa kaam kiya he
 Everyone has the same objective to advance a backward state like Bihar
 ham log aisa vikalp bihar kii janata ko den jo kam hi vaade kare lekin use puraa karne kaa kaam kare

 When i heard the sound of Dhoni's bat hitting the ball, i realized that it was a different sound
 yah aawaaj aapse kah rahi he ki ballebaaj kii maansikta badal gai he
 "he said," Dhoni's most important thing is his ability to withstand pressure which makes him a good captain
 varshon se vah paripakv hua he
 Doesn't show even when he is tense which is a good sign
 adhiktar agar captain jhallane vaala hota he yaa nervas ho jaataa he to team main dar paidaa ho jaataa he lekin dhoni ke saath aisa nahin he

 jahaan tak ‘game changer’ kii baat he to mujhe lagata he ki jasprit bumraah vishwa tii-20 main bharat ke liye vah khilaadi ho saktaa he
 His action is confusing and may seem slow but the ball hits the bat faster than he thinks
 ’’ Tendulkar said that the best thing about the Indian team is flexibility

 Stan said, 'I remember De Villiers urging Russell Domingo (then South African coach) to send David Miller to bat at number three, because De Villiers felt Miller was off the field

 He had almost fallen flat on his face
 'sten ne sweekaar kiya ki abi kii vah pari unki pasandida he
 In that wink ODI against the West Indies, De Villiers hit the fastest ODI century and with the first ball he started attacking the bowlers, then West Indies should blame Russell Domingo and David Miller for that record innings of de Villiers

 The court disputed 2
 77 acre jameen ko sunni vakf board, nirmohi akhaada or ram lallaa ke bich teen hisson main baant diya tha
 Slamming the legal battle that is ruining the social fabric, the apex court said in its judgment that the sharing of land will not serve anyone's interest nor will it bring lasting peace and stability
 pradhan nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali paanch sadasyeey samvidhan peeth ne kaha ki 30 sitambar, 2010 ke apane faisle main ucch nyaayalay ne aisa rasta chunaa jo khulaa hua nahin tha or aisi raahat di jisaki maang unke samaksh daayar mukademon main nahin kii gayi thi

 chandrachud, nyaayamurti ashok bhushan or nyaayamurti es abdul nazeer shaamil hai
 "we had already concluded that the disputing of the disputed land by the High Court in three parts was not legally sustainable," the bench said
 yahaan tak ki shanti or sthirataa banaae rakhane ke lihaaj se bhi vah sahi nahin tha
 The Supreme Court said that the petition filed by 'lord Shri Ram Lalla Virajaman' in 1989 was not imprecise as his 'worship service' continued despite the presence of the disputed mosque in Ayodhya
 ‘niyantran kaa kanoon' takalif main aaye paksh ko ek tay seemaa ke bheetar apni ore se mukadmaa / apil daayar karne ko kahata he

 use is ghatana ke 12 saal ke bheetar shikaayat darj karaane kaa adhikaar tha
 The Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice Justice Ranjan Gogoi rejected the contention of the Muslim side that the petition filed by Ram Lalla Virajaman is untrue as the incident is in 1949 and the petition was filed in 1989
 sheersh adaalat ne elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke faisle ke is hisse ko apane faisle main barkaraar rakhaa ki mukhya gumbad ke neeche kaa hissaa bhagwaan ram kii janmabhumi he
 The bench said that while deciding whether the petition filed by Ram Lalla Virajman was not in vain, we have to take care of one thing that Ram Lalla was not made a party in other cases
 yani upaask gopal singh vishaarad, nirmohi akhaada or sunni vakf board ne apni argiyon main ram lallaa ko paksh nahin banaaya tha
 He said that in case number five, both (ram Lalla) and second (janmabhoomi) have their own judicial personality

 The bench said that despite the seizure of the disputed property on December 29, 1949, the important thing is that the 'seva-puja' of Ram Lalla never stopped

 But it did not wave any program for direct employment in the country
 kya ye sarkaar kii chook thi ki aaj desh ke saamne rojgaar kii samasya sabase bada mudda banakar khadaa hua he
 Modi government launched program 1 in 2014
 pradhanmantri jandhan yojana(28 agast 2014): is kaarykram ke tahat sarkaar kii koshish finanntial inklujan kii he jisase desh ke sabhi nagarikon kaa bank khaataa banaakar vittiya vyavastha se jodne kii he

 4
 antyoday yojana(25 sitambar 2014): is yojana se sarkaar kii koshish desh ke gramin or shahari ilaakon se garibi dur karne kii he
 To accomplish this, there is a provision to resort to skill development
 5
 Swachh Bharat Mission (2 October 2014): Through this program, the country has to get rid of the problem of Open Defecation (open Saunch) by 2019
 saath hi isse minial scavenging ko puri tarah se band karne par bhi jor he
 6
 adarsh gram yojana(11 oktober 2014): is rashtriya yojana se deshbhar main gram swaraj kii disha main aage badhane kii he
 The scheme has been linked to the Sansad Nidhi Fund and all mps have to make 3 villages ideal by 2019
 lihaaja, may 2014 main modi sarkaar ne kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad jin yojanaon ko rashtriya str par laanch karne kii koshish kii unamem se kisi yojana kaa sidhaa sarokaar desh main rojgaar uplabdh karaane ke liye nahin the
 Although most schemes are expected to generate new jobs, but that is possible only if these schemes are successful
 ab vaishvik str par america or anya europea deshon dwaara iti or seva kshetra main bade pherbadal karne ke baad bharat ke saamne bade str par logon kaa rojgaar chhinane kaa khatra paidaa ho chukaa he
 At the same time, the lack of any nationwide program to generate employment in the programs launched by the government in 2014 is deepening the employment crisis
 runaki-jhunaki beti maangila, padhal-pandivta damaadahe deenanath, darshan dihin na apan he deenanath!jaise hi sharada sinha kii awaz main kaanon main padati he, sharir kahin bhi ho aatma bihar kii galiyon main, apane gaanv or vahaan se guzarati hui nadi kii kinaaron ko chune ko machal jaati he
 It seems that everyone should leave and reach the ghat where there will be a courtyard covered with cow dung
 us lipe angan ke bichon-bich laal chunari, pile gotapanni se dhaka changera hoga
 Whose grandfather will rise on the forehead towards the river
 aage-aage dulhan-si saji pili sari, maang se naak tak sindur kii kataron main saji dadiji, ammaa, chachee or buaa log chal rahi hongi
 a bunch of us children wrapped in colorful clothes at the forefront
 sab ko jaldi hogi ghat par pahunchakar jagah gher lene kii
 The ghat which must have been built by Daddyji and Uncleji together
 jahaan ropa gaya hoga kele kaa ped or dopaher ko alpana uga aayi hongi bhabhi
 But where is it possible to return each time? Where are the foreigners able to meet? The mind goes wet sitting in a distant country sitting there in memories
 chaar bai chah ke kamare main baith aap jodate hai dinon ko, phir un palon ko or sochate hai ki gaanv main ammaa aaj, abhi kya kar rahi hogi? phone kol karne main jhijak hoti he ki kahin rundh na jaye galaa
 Don't know that Amma is sad
 aise main ammaa kaa hi kol aa jaataa he
 She starts telling herself that, "today was nai-khay
" lowki, chanaa kaa daal or arava chaur kaa bhaat banaaen hai
 Missing your call is why you are missing
 " phir ek-ek chiz yaad aane lag jaati he
 How on the day of nahay-khay, Amma marries the Chhatar Mahaparva of four days by getting up alone, bathing, wearing a yellow sari and lathi, offering water to Suryadev
 sirf ammaa hi nahin, samooche bihar main sabhi pavanatin (vrati) nahaay-khaay ke din bal dho snaan kar, is mahounushthan kaa pran leti hai
 On this day, gourd vegetables, dal and arva rice are cooked in pure ghee at home
 pehle pavanatin bhojan karti hai, phir prasad swaroop baaki log yahi khate hai
 ‘kharna’ occurs on the next day of nahai-khay
 is din se upwas shuru ho jaataa he
 From this day, the fast gives up food and water
 sanjh main maati ke bane nae chulhon par gaay kii doodh main gud daal kheer or sohari (roti) banataa he
 Then Nyoj (bhoga) is offered on a banana leaf five places or seven places
 jiske baad vrati apane haathon se prasad baantati he or ant main sabake kha lene ke baad khud bhi prasad grahan karke, usee puja vaale kamare main jameen par soti hai
 It is believed that when Mata Sita did Chhath while worshiping the Sun God during her exile, she slept on the ground, so the Vrati still sleeps on the ground
 kharnaa ke agle din hota he 'sanziya arghya' yani shaam vaala arghya
 Which starts in the morning
 bhor main hi uthatin hai pavanaitin or chulhaa jalaakar us par rakh detii hai, gud or pani ubalane ko
 Then the rest of the people get involved in making khajuri-thekua
 udhar ubalte hue gud vaale pani main chaaval kaa aataa mila 'kasaar' koi baandh rahaa hota, to idhar chhath kaa geet gaate hue koi tal rahi hoti he thekua-khajuri
 How it becomes from morning to noon is not known
 dopaher main daliya sajaane or soup sajaane kaa kaam shuru ho jaataa he
 In which she keeps green plants of ginger-turmeric, radish, betel-betel nut, aratak paat (a pure red round leaf which is then pasted at the door), yarn of yarn, orange keg, vermilion, apple, Orange, banana, coconut, reed and all the homemade dishes
 daliya sajaane ke baad use rakhte hai laal tokaron main, jise maathe par uthaa chalate hai parivaar ke mukhiya ghat kii taraf
 Where the setting sun is worshiped
 yah ek or khaas baat he is tyohaar kii
 While the rising sun is worshiped all over the world, Chhath is the only festival in which we worship the setting sun
 unhen arghya arpit karte hai
 To offer arghya, the winders descend into the river or pond where they stand a while ago and worship the sun, which is called 'thriha'
 baad arghya chadha lautate hai sab apane-apane gharon ko
 That night, 'cosia' is filled in the courtyard again
 yani eekh ke pedo ke bich mitti ke bane hathi or kurvaar ko ek ke upar ek rakh mitti kaa diya jalaate hai
 Amma and aunty get together soon after lighting the lamp, in the morning the Sun God starts singing for this
 kuch gane chhathi (shashti) mata ke liye bhi gaati hai
 It is believed that a long time ago there used to be a king, whose name was Priyamvand
 raja bahut pratapi the magar unki koi santan na thi
 He then performed a child-sacrifice sacrifice
 jiske baad unhen ek putr kii prapti bhi hui magar wo janmate hi mar gaya
 The king's children were so grieved that they decided to give up their lives in the crematorium
 jaise hi raja apana praan tyaagane ke liye nadi kii or bade thik usee vaqt bhagwaan kii putree shashthee devsena prakat hui or unhone raja se ghar laut kar apni puja-aradhana karne ko kaha
 He also assured the king that the king would definitely have children
 raja ghar ko laut aaye or unhone puure man se devi kii puja kii
 Later King Priyamvad received a son
 kehete hai ki raja ne ye puja karthik shukla paksh kii shashthee ko kiya tha isliye us din ke baad se chhath kii kii puja isi din kii jaati he
 After filling the Kosiya, preparations for 'arghya of dawn' begin
 log ghar se chaar baje ke aas-paas hi nikal padate hai ghat kii taraf
 Arriving at the ghat, laying the straw starts waiting for the sun to rise
 saikadon diye jala nadiyon or talabon main log pravaahit karte hai is ummid main ki ye diya jitani dur jaayegaa, isse jitna andhera chhatega unki duniya utani hi raushan hogi
 As Diya moves forward, the darkness starts sorting
 purab kii disha main laalimaa badhane lagati he
 It is said that the sun god appears
 ab vrati utarati hai phir se nadi main ek baar or arpit karti hai subah vaala arghya
 We apologize for the mistakes made during the festival
 or isi ke saath samaapt ho jaataa he aasthaa mahaparv bhi
 But right now in this era of social media, there is a section which is bent on rejecting the beliefs of this festival and proving it to be only patriarchal
 jinke liye ye tyohaar sirf naak par failaa sindur or nadi ke gande pani main khadi auraton kaa swasthya karaab karne kaa ek jariya bhar he
 They cannot understand the importance of this festival
 unhen nahin pataa ki is tyohaar kii vajah se nadiyon ke ghaaton kaa lagbhag kayakalp ho jaataa he
 It is wrong to see Chhath only with the attainment of son, in fact it is a fast of worship of the sun in a agricultural country like India, how is farming without the sun? So take a look at the list of offerings included in Chhath's soups: radish, ginger, turmeric, reed, sprouted gram, moong, dabha lemon, green coconut, banana, rice flour laddu, tekua, mungwa are all the offerings that are local products
 Especially in the same season there are yields coming out of the fields and the God who gives them all is offered to the sun
 is tyohaar ko prakruti ko khetihar samaaj kaa thanks giving bhi kah sakate hai
 Chhath festival is followed by Diwali
 diwaali ke dauraan saaf-safai ke baad jo bhi kooda-kachra paidaa hota he use saaf karke diwaali ke pehle shuru kiye gaye swatchta ko jari rakhaa jaataa he
 Chhath cleanliness is basically a festival of purity
 nadi kii puja, surya kii puja, nadi ke ghaaton kii safai, nadi ke jal main qamar tak duubakar haathon main nariyal lekar duubate or ugte surya kii upasna asal main prakruti kii hi upasna he
 For this purity, streets and drains of cities and villages have to be vigorously cleaned
 chhath main kisi shastreey vidhaan kaa zikr nahin miltaa

 So basically Chhath should be considered as Lokparva
 chhath ke geeton kii paryaay hai sharada sinha
 The typical desi khanak of his voice has always proved that Chhath is the homegrown festival of folk
 naak se lekar maang tak sindur chadhaai mahilaayein is tyohaar ko lead karti hai, inamen purushon kaa kaam sirf logistic uplabdh karaane waalon kaa hota he
 So in a way, this festival should be considered as a women-led festival of their empowerment
 prakruti ke najadik le jane vaale tyohaar main haalanki ab bazaar kii dakhal ho gai he, lekin jitna yah pavitra he, or jistarah baaki saamaajik or saanskrithik pradooshanon se bachaa hua he, usase lagata he ki yah praasangik bhi he or mahatvapurn bhi
 a lion remembers, people burn the rising sun, and when it sinks, they get up and walk, but Chhath refutes this fact
 ham muskuraate hue duubate suraj ko bhi arghya ke saath vidaa karte hai ki kal suruj dev ugenge to jaadon kii aahat ke saath puri sardiyon main apni krupa banaae rakhenge

 After the release of Hafiz Saeed, the boss of terror, it became clear that his arrest and his detention were just a show off

 pakistan ke punjab praant kii sarkaar ne hafiz kii najarbandi ko teen maheene or badhaane kii apil kii thi
 But the Lahore High Court ruled in favor of Hafiz

 America expressed unhappiness over Hafiz's release

 patari se utari hai saikadon ummiden or patari se utre hai saikadon bhavishya
 The system has been derailed, which talks about making the railways the best, and that claim has been derailed, in which there is talk of running a bullet train, but even a minor train derails here
 jab sau se zyada logon kii maut ho gai to sarkaar ne elaan kiya ki jaanch karenge, doshiyon ko bharpoor sajaa denge
 The Railway Minister, who arrived at the site of the incident, has bemoaned the situation when the government was running a zero accident mechanism in the railway development camp

 Of this, 60 per cent is spent on the renovation and maintenance of the tracks, while 25 per cent on accidental equipment
 phir bhi railway apni tuuti phooti patariyon par maut baantta phir rahaa he or sarkaar ke paas shok samvednaa ke sivaa kuch bachataa nahin
 The Prime Minister had made Suresh Prabhu the Minister of Railways that he would bring rail to the track of earning and security, but in the reign of Prabhu, many questions have been raised on the Railways
 1
 There was a break in the rail track in Pukhraya, so why was it not detected earlier? 2
 trek main daraar thi to train chalaane kaa faisla kyon liya gaya?3
 The fare increases but why does the government not guarantee safety in travel? 4
 pulon or patariyon par thos yojana kab tak banegi?5
 After all, why more than 86 thousand posts are lying vacant in the security category in Railways? 6
 kya aisi hi badintjami kii patari par daudegi bullate train?haal ke saalon main itnaa bada rail haadasa nahin hua tha

 Recently, many Rajya Sabha members have left the SP and joined the BJP

 In this film, he will be seen playing the role of cricketer Kapil Dev
 film kii kahani bhartiya cricket team dwaara jite gaye pehle world cap kii dastaan sunaati he
 Ranveer is working hard these days for the film
 bihar congress kaa vivaad rahul gandhi ke dar par pichley 2 dinon se chal rahaa he
 According to sources, the mlas spoke to Rahul Gandhi about the future of the Congress party
 apana road map bhi bataaya lekin is mulaakaat ke dauraan kuch vidhayakon ne akele chalane or lalu prasad kaa saath chhodane kii baat kahi
 This created a ruckus in the Congress
 rahul gandhi se milane gaye kuch vidhayakon ne congress ke saath rahane or lalu ke saath na jane kii baat kahi
 This protest raised such questions as to where the matter of resentment came from Lalu Prasad Yadav
 alaakaman ne pichley ek hafte main 27 vidhayakon main se do tihaai yani 18 ke alag dhada na bana lene par najar banaae rakhi or us par roak lagaai
 In the event of the breakup of 18 mlas, they will also get recognition and the party will be troubled
 aise main gulam nabi aaazaad or ahamed patel ne aisi koshishen jari rakhin ki do tihaai vidhayak na tooten
 In the meantime, such questions arose that what is the meaning of the signature campaign in the name of opposing Lalu in Bihar Pradesh Congress? Who is behind this whole exercise and why it was carried out
 alaakaman ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik teen baar aise maukey aae ki congress ko nitish ke khilaaf ekajute dikhnaa padaa
 The first opportunity came in the presidential election when the state president Ashok Chaudhary got all 27 Congress mlas to vote in favor of Meera Kumar, separate from Nitish
 doosraa mauka uparashtrapati chunaav main aayaa jab nitish congress kaa saath chhod chuke the lekin tab bhi sabhi 27 vidhayak nitish ke khilaaf gopal krishna gandhi ke paksh main the
 The big occasion was when Nitish voted on the Chief Minister's chair
 congress ke sabhi vidhayakon ne lalu kii argedy ke saath milakar nitish ke khilaaf matdaan kiya
 After all this, the Congress high command decided that now, according to the chance in future, an alliance with Lalu will have to be done
 sab kuch sahi chal rahaa tha lekin achaanak hi khabar aayi ki bihar pradesh congress main ek hastakshar abhiyaan chalaa he
 It mentions Lalu's misbehavior with the Congress
 aise main congress alaakaman faisla kare
 The matter was simple that the Congress had gone with Lalu
 nitish bijepi se haath mila chuke the
 So what does a signature campaign against Lalu say? Should Congress go with Nitish Kumar in bjp's lap? congress todane kii thi koshish!sutron kii maane to koshish do tihaai yani 18 vidhayakon ko todane kii thi
 The case also reached 13–14
 isi bich baat fail gai
 In view of all the equations and evidence, the Congress high command decided that Ashok Chaudhary, close to Nitish, who was the state president and minister in the Nitish government for 4 years, would have to go
 baaten aisi bhi sunne main ain kicongress ke bheetar santhnik chunaavhone hai
 Rahul Gandhi has to become the president
 us prakriya ke tahat agle ek dedh maheene main bihar pradesh congress ke adhyaksh ko badal diya jaae
 It was also said that his 4-year term has also been completed
 is bich aise bhi sawaal uthe ki jab pradesh adhyaksh ashok choudhary rahenge or saath membihar pradesh main sanghathanke chunaav honge to ashok choudhary apane kai logon ko jila adhyaksh banavaa denge
 In such a situation, if Ashok Chaudhary duped Congress in future, then many of his appointed district presidents could shock the Congress
 aise main party ne jald se jald unhen is pad se hataane kaa nirnay liya he
 There have also been questions that even though Ashok Chaudhary is talking about opposing RJD and Lalu today, he forgot that he became MLC with the help of RJD when Congress had four mlas
 party ne vidhansabha kaa chunaav ho yaa uske pehle loksabhaa kaa chunaav bhi saath hi ladaa he
 This is the reason that controversy has increased in Congress
 bhale hi congress ke vidhayak na tooten lekin lalu virodh kii vajah se party main sabakuch sahi to nahin hi dikhaai de rahaa he

 ) bangladesh or mejabaan srilanka ke bich nidahaas tii-20 tri siries ke chathe mukaable ke aakhri overon main kaaphi drama dekha gaya
 Players from both teams got into a tiff and felt that the match would not be complete
 haalanki match hua or bangladesh ne is romaanchak match main srilanka ko haraa diya
 Bangladesh team chasing a target of 160 runs needed 12 runs to win in the last over
 yahi samay tha jab sara drama shuru hua
 For the first two balls Bangladesh batsmen could not score any runs in this over of Isuru Udana for Sri Lanka
 vahiin 2 bounsar or duusare ball par ran out ke rup main wicket girane se bangladesh captain shaakib-al-hasan naaraaz ho gaye

 Kusal Perera scored 61 and Tisara Perera scored 58 runs
 match main hue vivaad par tameem ne kaha ki yah kaaphi imotional match tha
 According to him, they saw the umpire giving a no ball gesture
 isliye unhone shikaayat kii
 This is why so much drama happened

 However, the dispute is over now
 isse pehle tameem ikbaal ke pachaas ran kii pari se bangladesh ko majboot shuruyaat mili

 bangladesh team main laute shakibabangladesh ke liye ek acchhee baat yah he ki uske niyamit captain or olerounder shaakib al hasan chot ke baad vaapasi kar rahe hai
 Shakib was not in the team in the first three matches of this series, but on Thursday, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has informed that Shakib will recover from injury and captain the team in this match
 iske alaava bangladesh ko is match main ek tarah se maansik badhat hasil hogi

 Shakib's arrival in this match will give the team strength in both bowling and batting, but it will be interesting to see who he replaces on the field
 in donon ke alaava ballebaaji main daaromadar tameem ikbaal, mushfikur rahim or mahamudullah par hoga
 In bowling, Mustafizur Rahman, Rubel Hussain have a big responsibility to stop Sri Lankan batsmen

 After Diwali, there are preparations for big political blasts in UP
 darasal, congress ko lag rahaa he ki, upi main shila dikshit ko siem kaa cheharaa banane kaa daanv kuch thik nahin baith rahaa
 The BSP is not willing to align with respectable seats from the Congress, so a large section of Congress leaders is now advocating from the high command to stop the BJP in UP by aligning with the Samajwadi Party with smaller parties including JDU, RLD
 siyaasi shatranj main gotiyaan bichaana bhi shuru kiya ja chukaa he
 Akhilesh is taking arbitrary decisions in the UP government and Sharad Yadav of JDU is meeting Sonia
 sammanjanak siten or nitish formule par baat ban sakati he, november main is par aakhri faisla hoga
 On the condition of anonymity, the leaders of Congress and SP say that when the pair of akhilesh-rahul and priyanka-dimple will enter the field, then there will be a panic
 saath hi purvanchal mennitish kumaaraki chhavi kaa phayda hoga, kurmi votbank kaa phayda bhi hoga
 Ajit Singh and Jayant will benefit in western UP
 kul milakar gathjod bijepi ke saamne chunauti banakar ubharegaa or bijepi virdohi vot ko ek jagah muhaiyaa karaayegaa, saath hi muslim vot bhi ekajute rahegaa
 This is the formula to convince Rahul
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi himself does not want to appear on the same lines with Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ajit Singh, as he had avoided Lalu Yadav in Bihar
 aise main rahul ko formula sujhaayaa gaya he ki bihar main nitish kii tarah upi main siem cheharaa to akhilesh honge, baaki to samarthan main honge, usase aapako kya aitraaj
 On the lines of Bihar, you should be the axis of BJP opposition on Akhilesh's face and be the national face of BJP opposition in 2019
 udhar, akhilesh ne bhi apni haalia kaaryastylee se sandesh dene kii koshish kii he ki ab wo apane hisaab sesarkaar chalaayengekisi ke dabaav main nahin
 Akhilesh has given a strong message about not taking Shivpal and other ministers back
 upi main gathjod ke liye majaboor ho rahi congressutron kii maane to shuruaati prachaar ke baad congress netaaon ko lagata he ki congress kaa vot pratishat to bad saktaa he
 But the seats were not increasing very much
 aise main jab bijepi apana dal or choti partiyon se talmail kar rahi he, to upi main usko rokane ke liye congress ko bhi gathbandhan bana kar muqaabala karnaa hoga
 The Congress feels that the bjp's defeat is more important than the Congress victory in UP
 vaise bhi congress kii nigahen 2019 main modi ko rokane par hai
 In such a situation, his first choice for coordination is BSP, but he is not ready for alliances
 isliye bihar ke nitish formule par nae sire se baatcheet shuru ho chuki he
 The writing of a new text has already started in Uttar Pradesh, but there are many issues like the number of seats, personal ambitions of leaders and the fight for honor, which will be resolved only then the matter will move forward
 isliye november kaa maheenaa siyaasi guna-bhaag ke lihaaj se upi main kaaphi ahm he
 But keep in mind, everything should be decided, announcement should be made, only then assume that Bihar's Nitish formula is being implemented in UP as well
 kyonki, abhi raah main bahut rode hai or bhaanumati kaa kunba he, jisko jodna hoga

 The Kandi village of Bahadurpur, which is about 25 kilometers from this Kumbh city on Jhansi road, became a cemetery for cows
 kareeb do bigha kshetrafal main mitti kii med banaakar gheri gai is goshaala main lagaataar barish ke chalate pani bhar gaya
 As soon as the morning of 12 July, 35 cows in Gaushala died

 Frightened administrative officials tried to make the incident a natural disaster

 Chandan Singh Sharma clarified that 22 animals died on the spot due to lightning in the early hours of 4 am, while 13 were severely scorched

 The cowshed did not have a tin shed to protect the cattle from the rain
 goshaala main eent bichhi honi chahie thim lekin goshaala mitti par hi chal rahi thi, jo barish main daldal banakar maweshiyon ke liye kaal ban gai
 The next day of the Prayagraj incident, on July 13, more than 30 animals, living under the open sky, succumbed to the rains in the gaushalas built in Palia Mafi in Milkipur and Baisinh village of Pura Bazaar in Ayodhya district
 soobe main jaise-jaise barish tej hoti gai, goshaalaon ke rakh-rakhaav main sarkari rasm adaayagi bhi khulkar saamne aati gai
 The death of more than 100 animals in gaushalas of several districts including Mirzapur, Barabanki, Hardoi, brought to light the government's negligence
 in ghatnaon ne yah sabit kiya ki kis tarah adhikari sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi yojana main palitha laga rahe hai
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath suspended eight officials of mirzapur-ayodhya for negligence in management of cowsheds
 mukhyamantri ne doshiyon par govadh adhinium or pashu krurta adhinium main karrwai karne ke nirdesh die hai
 During the Lok Sabha election campaign, the chief minister was moaning with the animals
 iske baad april ke pehle hafte main mukhyamantri ne video conferencing ke jariye sabhi jiladhikariyon ko aawaara jaanwaron ko pakad kar goshaalaon main bhejne ke nirdesh die the
 Says Harnam Singh Varma, regional president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, "gaushalas are being constructed at a very slow pace
 aawaara pashuon ke liye goshaalaayein kam pad gai hai
 The number of livestock in working cowsheds has increased considerably
 biimaar pashuon ke liye alag vyavastha bhi nahin he
 This has increased the crisis
 ''goseva ayog kii jaanch team jab prayagraj ke kaandi gaanv main maujuud goshaala pahunchi to use vahaan 300 se adhik pashu mili, jabaki kshamta 50 pashuon ko hi rakhane kii he

 As soon as Ramareddy touched the walls of the cowshed, the plaster of the place started falling

 The Principal Secretary formed a three-member team to investigate the construction scam

 Volunteer Nitin Chaudhary, who runs a campaign to stop stray cattle in Aligarh, says, "the government approved the budget for the construction of the cowshed, but did not make any monitoring arrangements

 Some of these were to be built to a capacity of 3,400 animals, but to strike the horoscope on a budget, a coalition of officers and contractors created very low capacity cowsheds
 shikaayat milane par jab muradabad kamishnar ne jaanch karai to puraa bhrashtachar khul gaya
 The Gaushala paper at Nhataur in Bijnor has a capacity of 300 animals but only 25 animals can come in a room costing Rs 50 lakh
 goshaalaon main gobar gas sanyatra bhi lagaaya janaa tha lekin vah nadaarad he
 In many, the entire budget was burnt to build interlocking roads and boundary walls

 For food, the government gets 30 rupees per cow cattle, yet even more than this, Veer Singh has to make arrangements himself
 singh bataate hai, ''ek gaay ko din bhar main kam se kam chaar kilo bhusa, haraa chaara, khali, aataa kii jarurat hoti he jo 80 rupye main miltaa he
 On an average, the cost comes to 150 rupees, including animal feed and medicines
 is hisaab se sarkaar kii madad bahut kam he
 This is the reason why gaushala operators are reluctant to keep more animals

 '' Harnam Singh Verma, Regional President, Bharatiya Kisan Union *** master blaster sachin tendulkar australia main hai or australia sachin ke kadamon main hai
 Yes, according to a survey conducted in Australia, Sachin Tendulkar has gone one step ahead of cricket's biggest star Sir Don Bradman
 hindustan ke liye isse badhkar gaurav kii baat kya hogi ki khud don bradmen ke ghar main hi don se bada ho gaya he unka sachin
 The history of Test cricket goes its way between these two stars
 breadman ne test cricket ko apane pairon par khadaa kiya to sachin ne use daudna sikhaa diya
 Both stand at the point of their specialty and record, where the comparison between the two starts
 nayi research khud don breadman ke desh australia se hi aayi he, jisamen paaya gaya ki don se bada khilaadi master blaster hai
 Researcher Doctor Nicholas Rhode of Griffith University, Australia has done this study
 ye study apane apane vakt ke tamaam bade khilaadiyo ko lekar kiya gaya he
 Researcher's formula is such that the player's total career run is subtracted from the average player's career run in the same number of matches
 masalan sachin tendulkar ne 184 test maichon main khelkar 15183 ran banaae hai to ye dekha gaya ki duusare khilaadiyon ko agar 184 test match khilne kaa mauka miltaa to apane ausat ke hisaab se wo kitne ran banaate
 Based on this formula, Nicholas Roade came to the conclusion that Sachin Tendulkar has surpassed Sir Donald Bradman and sits at number 1 in the list of top ten Test cricketers
 vaise isse pehle bhi sachin or breadman ke bich tulana hoti rahi he or kai baar sachin cricket ke sabase bade don se aage nikal jate rahe hai

 big bos kaa har sijan khaas hota he
 Season 12 was also highlighted for several reasons
 sho main kai nai chijen aisi huin, jinhen pichley sijan main nahin dekha gaya
 Let's take a look at the things that happened for the first time in Bigg Boss season 12
 # 1
 Low TRP Season 12 received a much lower TRP than the previous season
 number game main big bos 12 shuruyaat se hi peeche rahaa
 The show's TRP was followed by a faded performance and low involvement of celebrity contestants
 celebs ummid ke mutabik pradarshan nahin kar paae
 Tasks also did not go well
 # 2
 The biggest reason for the task cancellation of Bigg Boss 12 season is not to perform well for the contestants
 celebrity kheme main task ko lekar josh or jazbe kii kami dikhi
 Deepika Kakkar Ibrahim and Sreesanth did not perform the task vigorously
 srisanth ne task main yaa to quit kiya he yaa phir khel bigaada he
 For the first time in the history of Bigg Boss, many tasks have been canceled

 bharat main jajon kii kami kaa zikr kai chif justise pehle bhi kar chuke hai
 Speaking at the Lok Adalats conference in Jaipur in 2003, then Chief Justice of India VN Khare had said, the backlog in the courts is getting very long
 buniyadi dhaancha bahut kamazor he
 The number of judges is small
 america main 10 lakh kii aabaadi par 135 jaj hai, bharat main 10 lakh kii aabaadi par 13 jaj hai
 a strong judiciary is essential for healthy democracy
 2003 se pehle bhi kisi ne kaha hi hoga lekin ye 2016 aa gaya he
 You think the Chief Justice of the middle must have forgotten this issue
 2004 main bharat ke tab ke pradhan nyaayadhish ne justise aar si lahoti ne kaha ki lambit mukademon ke liye jajon kii kami ko doshi tehraaya tha
 According to the report of the Tribune, Justice Lahoti had asked the Chief Justices of the High Court to keep an eye on the lower courts so that the trial of the cases would continue in time
 aap soch rahe honge ki 2003, 2004 main chif justise ne jajon kii kami kii baat kii hogi to sarkarein harakat main aa hi gayi hongi
 Five years later, in 2009, Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan said on November 26 on the occasion of National Law Day that in 2008, 1
 8 karod nae cese file hue the jisase pataa chalata he ki logon kaa nyaaypalika main kitna vishwaas he
 14,000 judges had also dealt with 17 million cases
 matlab ek jaj ek saal main 1200 maamalon ko nipta detaa he
 This has been shown to work even after the shortage of judges and lack of infrastructure
 2008 main bhartiya adaalaton main 4 karod 80 lakh mukademon kii sunwaayee hui
 This figure is many times more than the court of any country in the world
 yahi kaaran he ki mukademon kii sunwaayee puri hone main kai saal lag jate hai
 Justice Balakrishnan had said that there is such a shortage of judges that a judge does not get more than 25 minutes to look at a case
 kya aapako dar nahin lagata he
 Line to the doctor

 ravivaar kaa din tha or mauka tha anual chif ministar or chif justices conference main bharat ke maujuuda pradhan nyaayadhish vahi baat doharaate hai jo unke purv ke pradhan nyaayadhish kah gaye hai
 The Hindi translation of what he said in English is something like this - the number of judges in India needs to be increased from 7675 to 40,357
 das lakh kii aabaadi par jajon kii sankhya 10 se badhkar 50 ho
 In 1987, the Law Commission suggested 40,000 thousand judges in the country
 magar kuch nahin hua
 In 2002, the Parliamentary Standing Committee headed by Pranab Mukherjee also said that the number of judges is very less
 bharat main das lakh kii aabaadi par das hi jaj hai
 The standing committee suggested that it be increased from 10 to 50
 10 lakh par 50 jajon kii niyukti se desh main jajon kii sankhya 40,000 ho jaati he
 but nothing happened
 21 farvari 2013 ko chif justise altamas kabir ne tab ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko likhaa magar kuch nahin hua
 Chief Justice TS Thakur was not passionate about the shortage of judges at every level of the judiciary
 aakraamak the
 We were saying that we have discussed at every level that the number of judges should be increased in lower courts
 hai court main jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 We discussed this and agreed that morning and evening courts would have to be started and for this the help of retired judges be sought
 10 saal se jelon main band under trial ke liye kuch vishesh karnaa hoga
 We have discussed at every stage and agreed that no case should be more than five years old in the lower courts and the High Court
 wo kehete ja rahe the ki ham is baat ke liye, us baat ke liye charchaa kar chuke hai
 Have been agreeing
 is par bhi charchaa kar chuke hai ki 14 wein vitt ayog ke tahat jo tamaam grant mili hai uskaa istemaal karenge
 i know you are not a lawyer, but as the Prime Minister of this country you would know that in 1950 the Supreme Court started with 8 judges
 tab maatr 1215 cese the
 We started with 100 cases on one judge
 ek dashak ke bheetar jajon kii sankhya 14 hui or cese ho gaye 3247
 In 1986, the Supreme Court had 26 judges and the number of cases was 27,881
 is vakt hamaari kshamta 31 he or mukademon kii sankhya 77,151 2014 tak 31 jajon ke upar lambit mukademon kii sankhya 81,583 thi jise hamane kam karke 60,260 par laa diya he
 The Chief Justice made good use of this opportunity so that the attention of the people goes to the shortage of judges
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki kis tarah supreme court main jajon kii kami ke baad bhi lambit mukademon kii sankhya main kami ai he
 He said that the number of lawsuits in the courts is increasing
 aaj hai court main 38 lakh 68 hazaar mukademe lambit hai
 Vacancy of 434 judges should be filled
 chif justise ne kaha, 'wo poochhate the sawaal ki agar ek sadak 5 aadmi 10 din main banaate hai, vahi sadak agar ek din main banani ho to kitne aadmi chahie
 And the answer was, 50 people is needed
 3868000 cese ko nipataane ke liye kitne aadmi chahie
 How many judges are needed
 ye baat ham kyon nahin samajhate
 In the way of explaining the Fifth Pass, he gave it, but he did not pay any attention to the man who has to suffer the lack of judges
 desh bhar main nyaaypalika ke muddon ko lekar tarah-tarah ke hai profile sammelan hote rahete hai
 In which sometimes the Chief Minister and sometimes the Prime Minister and sometimes the Chief Justice keep going
 har sammelan main aisi baat kahi ja rahi he magar dedh dashak se kahi ja rahi he phir bhi paryaapt sudhaar nahin hue hai
 In the month of March itself, the Prime Minister himself expressed concern about the pending cases in the centenary celebrations of the establishment of Patna High Court
 patna main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki meri ek salaah he, or yah idia mujhe abhi-abhi aayaa he ki hamaari adaalaton ko har saal ek bulatin lekar aani chahie jisamen sabase puraane mukademon ko hilite kiya gaya ho
 Some may be forty years old, some may also be 50 years old
 isse logon main ek samvedansheeltaa jaagegi ki kitne saare mukademen hai jo lambit hai
 This will create an atmosphere of how to solve these other cases
 lambit mukademon kii jaankaree ke prati maahaul to dashakon se ban rahaa he
 Reports come in newspapers every day
 sammelnon main charchaa hoti rahati he
 The question is whether the appointment or number of judges will increase or will it improve only with sensitivity or awareness
 26 aktubar 2009 ke hindu akhbaar kii report ke anusaar tab ke kanoon mantri virappa moili ne kaha tha ki sabhi lambit mukademon ko 30 november 2009 neshnal greed par daal diya jayega
 There is a full figure of pending lawsuits on the national grid
 agar aap NJDG, neshnal judicial data greed ke naam se search karenge to ek pej khulegaa jis par aaj ke samay tak ke saare mukademon kii suchi mil jaaegi
 If we looked at the data till Monday evening 10 saalon se adhik lambit mukademon kii sankhya bharat main 22 lakh 58 hazaar 441 hai
 The number of cases pending between 5 and 10 years is 38 lakh, 28 thousand 117
 zaahir he lambit mukademon ke bare main jaanane ke zariyaa hamaare paas uplabdh he
 Apart from the National Data Grid, you can see the status of the lawsuits of all the courts across the country online by visiting the site of the e-court
 neshnal greed yaa i court jaankaree ke liye he lekin kya ye suvidhaayen jajon kii kami ko puri kar sakati hai
 The Chief Justice clearly stated that the solution is to increase the number of judges
 jo naam hamane bheje hai unhen manzur karne main do-do maheene na lage
 If there is any objection, talk to us directly because the collegium which appointed the judges has finalized the names as part of the long process
 2010 main centre ne tay kiya tha ki ek rashtriya litigeshan niti laai jaaegi jiske tahat rajyon ko apane sarkari mukademon kii sankhya kam kerani thi lekin 2015 tak kii antim soochna ke hisaab se is par cabinut vichaar kar rahi he
 On the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Allahabad Court in March itself, President Pranab Mukherjee said that delay in justice is unfair
 jajon kii sankhya badhaani chahie or khaali padon ko jaldi bharna chahie
 We wanted to know how much the judges really do
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne apane str par pataa kar bataaya ki supreme court ke kisi jaj ko kitna kaam karnaa padataa he

 ashish ne bataaya ki ek jaj ko rozaana 18 ghante kaam karnaa padataa he
 Remains in the court from ten to four in the morning
 iske baad ghar jaakar dedh ghante aaraam karte hai
 Then they start preparing for the next day's lawsuits

 After a walk from seven to eight in the morning, then prepare the case again

 Many judges also work late nights on Saturdays and Sundays
 mukademon ko daakhil karnaa, daakhil hue mukademon ko sunanaa, faisla likhane ke alaava unke anya prashasnic kaam bhi hote hai
 Their full potential is judged on how fast they listen to the case, understand it and pass judgment

 chif justise ne kaha ki jab baahar se jaj aate hai to hamen dekhakar hairaan hote hai
 On 7 April, Pradeep Thakur wrote in the 'times of India' that according to a study, a High Court judge has only five or six minutes for a trial
 pehali baar aisa adhyayan hua he
 The busiest judge, that is, he who has a lot of cases, has only two and a half minutes to hear a case
 jo sabase kam vyast he uske paas maatr 15 se 16 minute hai
 They have to give a decision in five to six minutes
 bangaloru kii ek sanstha he daksh usne ye adhyayan kiya he
 For example, 163 judges come to the Kolkata High Court every day for a hearing

 Why did the facilities in the courts not be increased
 aapako insaaf se koun dur rakh rahaa he
 a man waits for forty years in the courts for a verdict

 His wait for decision is short

 Will the solution come out of making a list of cases or is this question very easy by increasing the number of judges

 8 karod nae cese file hue the jisase pataa chalata he ki logon kaa nyaaypalika main kitna vishwaas he
 14,000 judges had also dealt with 17 million cases
 matlab ek jaj ek saal main 1200 maamalon ko nipta detaa he
 This has been shown to work even after the shortage of judges and lack of infrastructure
 2008 main bhartiya adaalaton main 4 karod 80 lakh mukademon kii sunwaayee hui
 This figure is many times more than the court of any country in the world
 yahi kaaran he ki mukademon kii sunwaayee puri hone main kai saal lag jate hai
 Justice Balakrishnan had said that there is such a shortage of judges that a judge does not get more than 25 minutes to look at a case
 kya aapako dar nahin lagata he
 Line to the doctor
 jaj ke paas line
 Line near builder too
 vahaan bhi logon ko flats milane main chaar saal kii deree kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 25 minutes for a case
 jaj sahab computer se bhi tej kaam karte honge
 All this thoughtful 2016 came
 ravivaar kaa din tha or mauka tha anual chif ministar or chif justices conference main bharat ke maujuuda pradhan nyaayadhish vahi baat doharaate hai jo unke purv ke pradhan nyaayadhish kah gaye hai
 The Hindi translation of what he said in English is something like this - the number of judges in India needs to be increased from 7675 to 40,357
 das lakh kii aabaadi par jajon kii sankhya 10 se badhkar 50 ho
 In 1987, the Law Commission suggested 40,000 thousand judges in the country
 magar kuch nahin hua
 In 2002, the Parliamentary Standing Committee headed by Pranab Mukherjee also said that the number of judges is very less
 bharat main das lakh kii aabaadi par das hi jaj hai
 The Standing Committee suggested that it should be increased from 10 to 50
 10 lakh par 50 jajon kii niyukti se desh main jajon kii sankhya 40,000 ho jaati he
 but nothing happened
 21 farvari 2013 ko chif justise altamas kabir ne tab ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko likhaa magar kuch nahin hua
 Chief Justice TS Thakur was not passionate about the shortage of judges at every level of the judiciary
 aakraamak the
 We were saying that we have discussed at every level that the number of judges should be increased in lower courts
 hai court main jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 We discussed this and agreed that morning and evening courts would have to be started and for this the help of retired judges be sought
 10 saal se jelon main band under trial ke liye kuch vishesh karnaa hoga
 We have discussed at every stage and agreed that no case should be more than five years old in the lower courts and the High Court
 wo kehete ja rahe the ki ham is baat ke liye, us baat ke liye charchaa kar chuke hai
 Have been agreeing
 is par bhi charchaa kar chuke hai ki 14 wein vitt ayog ke tahat jo tamaam grant mili hai uskaa istemaal karenge
 i know you are not a lawyer, but as the Prime Minister of this country you would know that in 1950 the Supreme Court started with 8 judges
 tab maatr 1215 cese the
 We started with 100 cases on one judge
 ek dashak ke bheetar jajon kii sankhya 14 hui or cese ho gaye 3247
 In 1986, the Supreme Court had 26 judges and the number of cases was 27,881
 is vakt hamaari kshamta 31 he or mukademon kii sankhya 77,151 2014 tak 31 jajon ke upar lambit mukademon kii sankhya 81,583 thi jise hamane kam karke 60,260 par laa diya he
 The Chief Justice made good use of this opportunity so that the attention of the people goes to the shortage of judges
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki kis tarah supreme court main jajon kii kami ke baad bhi lambit mukademon kii sankhya main kami ai he
 He said that the number of lawsuits in the courts is increasing
 aaj hai court main 38 lakh 68 hazaar mukademe lambit hai
 Vacancy of 434 judges should be filled
 chif justise ne kaha, 'wo poochhate the sawaal ki agar ek sadak 5 aadmi 10 din main banaate hai, vahi sadak agar ek din main banani ho to kitne aadmi chahie
 And the answer was, 50 people is needed
 3868000 cese ko nipataane ke liye kitne aadmi chahie
 How many judges are needed
 ye baat ham kyon nahin samajhate
 In the way of explaining the Fifth Pass, he gave it, but he did not pay any attention to the man who has to suffer the lack of judges
 desh bhar main nyaaypalika ke muddon ko lekar tarah-tarah ke hai profile sammelan hote rahete hai
 In which sometimes the Chief Minister and sometimes the Prime Minister and sometimes the Chief Justice keep going
 har sammelan main aisi baat kahi ja rahi he magar dedh dashak se kahi ja rahi he phir bhi paryaapt sudhaar nahin hue hai
 In the month of March itself, the Prime Minister himself expressed concern about the pending cases in the centenary celebrations of the establishment of Patna High Court
 patna main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki meri ek salaah he, or yah idia mujhe abhi-abhi aayaa he ki hamaari adaalaton ko har saal ek bulatin lekar aani chahie jisamen sabase puraane mukademon ko hilite kiya gaya ho
 Some may be forty years old, some may also be 50 years old
 isse logon main ek samvedansheeltaa jaagegi ki kitne saare mukademen hai jo lambit hai
 This will create an atmosphere of how to solve these other cases
 lambit mukademon kii jaankaree ke prati maahaul to dashakon se ban rahaa he
 Reports come in newspapers every day
 sammelnon main charchaa hoti rahati he
 The question is whether the appointment or number of judges will increase or will it improve only with sensitivity or awareness
 26 aktubar 2009 ke hindu akhbaar kii report ke anusaar tab ke kanoon mantri virappa moili ne kaha tha ki sabhi lambit mukademon ko 30 november 2009 neshnal greed par daal diya jayega
 There is a full figure of pending lawsuits on the national grid
 agar aap NJDG, neshnal judicial data greed ke naam se search karenge to ek pej khulegaa jis par aaj ke samay tak ke saare mukademon kii suchi mil jaaegi
 If we looked at the data till Monday evening 10 saalon se adhik lambit mukademon kii sankhya bharat main 22 lakh 58 hazaar 441 hai
 The number of cases pending between 5 and 10 years is 38 lakh, 28 thousand 117
 zaahir he lambit mukademon ke bare main jaanane ke zariyaa hamaare paas uplabdh he
 Apart from the National Data Grid, you can see the status of the lawsuits of all the courts across the country online by visiting the site of the e-court
 neshnal greed yaa i court jaankaree ke liye he lekin kya ye suvidhaayen jajon kii kami ko puri kar sakati hai
 The Chief Justice clearly stated that the solution is to increase the number of judges
 jo naam hamane bheje hai unhen manzur karne main do-do maheene na lage
 If there is any objection, talk to us directly because the collegium which appointed the judges has finalized the names as part of the long process
 2010 main centre ne tay kiya tha ki ek rashtriya litigeshan niti laai jaaegi jiske tahat rajyon ko apane sarkari mukademon kii sankhya kam kerani thi lekin 2015 tak kii antim soochna ke hisaab se is par cabinut vichaar kar rahi he
 On the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Allahabad Court in March itself, President Pranab Mukherjee said that delay in justice is unfair
 jajon kii sankhya badhaani chahie or khaali padon ko jaldi bharna chahie
 We wanted to know how much the judges really do
 hamaare sahyogi ashish bhargav ne apane str par pataa kar bataaya ki supreme court ke kisi jaj ko kitna kaam karnaa padataa he
 i wish we could shoot a judge's entire routine with the camera and show you
 mujhe to sunakar yakeen nahin hua ki jaj sahab kaam ke alaava koi kaam nahin kar pate hai
 One should file a public interest litigation for how to breathe
 ashish ne bataaya ki ek jaj ko rozaana 18 ghante kaam karnaa padataa he
 Remains in the court from ten to four in the morning
 iske baad ghar jaakar dedh ghante aaraam karte hai
 Then they start preparing for the next day's lawsuits
 har mukademe kii file dekhni hoti he
 a file is of 100 pages and some of fifty pages
 iske bich faisla bhi dictate karnaa hota he
 Go to sleep by half past eleven and wake up at five o'clock
 jajon ko tahalnaa acha lagata he
 After a walk from seven to eight in the morning, then prepare the case again
 saadhe nau baje ke aas paas court ke liye nikal jate hai
 Many judges also work late nights on Saturdays and Sundays
 mukademon ko daakhil karnaa, daakhil hue mukademon ko sunanaa, faisla likhane ke alaava unke anya prashasnic kaam bhi hote hai
 Their full potential is judged on how fast they listen to the case, understand it and pass judgment
 nichali adaalaton ke jajon kaa pramotion to inhen baton par tikaa hota he ki kitne cese ko niptaya he
 Can a judge read 50 files in a day
 subah saat baje se raat ke 11 baje tak jaj kaam karte hai, phir chuttee ke din bhi
 So is it okay to look at their vacation? chif justise tii es thakur ne kaha ki ham sirf manali nahin jate hai
 Those who are judges of constitutional bench are writing their decisions
 agar ek paksh taiyaar he to doosraa paksh taiyaar nahin he
 Ask Bar whether he is ready
 teen hafte kii chuttee hoti he
 During this time also some judges listen to the cases
 sawaal he ki kya chuttee samaapt kar dene se jajon kii sankhya kii zarurat samaapt ho jaaegi
 40 thousand judges are required
 aath hazaar ke kareeb jaj hai
 Can this deficiency be reduced by reducing the leave to three or four weeks
 kya ye mumkin hai ki koi jaj ek din main bees mukademon kii file dekh le
 He has to listen to both sides, read the law and write the decision
 bich-bich main shakespeare ko bhi kot karnaa hota he
 Now i understand why our judges continue to quote Shakespeare
 duusare kisi ko padhane kaa vakt hi nahin miltaa hoga
 The Supreme Court of America has 9 judges
 sabko milakar ek saal main 81 keson main faisla dena hota he
 In India, a judge hears an average of 2600 lawsuits, passing judgment
 chif justise ne kaha ki jab baahar se jaj aate hai to hamen dekhakar hairaan hote hai
 On 7 April, Pradeep Thakur wrote in the 'times of India' that according to a study, a High Court judge has only five or six minutes for a trial
 pehali baar aisa adhyayan hua he
 The busiest judge, that is, he who has a lot of cases, has only two and a half minutes to hear a case
 jo sabase kam vyast he uske paas maatr 15 se 16 minute hai
 They have to give a decision in five to six minutes
 bangaloru kii ek sanstha he daksh usne ye adhyayan kiya he
 For example, 163 judges come to the Kolkata High Court every day for a hearing
 ek cese ke liye do minute jitna hi samay hota he
 The judges of Patna, Hyderabad, Jharkhand, Rajasthan get two to three minutes for a case every day
 kya ek arab 25 karod kii aabaadi ke liye ucch or ucchtam nyaalayon ke 619 jaj paryaapt he
 The comments kisi ko bhi lagegaa ki uske saath koi mazaaq kar rahaa he
 Think who is joking with you
 aakhir sarkaron ne jajon kii sankhya kyon nahin badhaai
 Why did the facilities in the courts not be increased
 aapako insaaf se koun dur rakh rahaa he
 a man waits for forty years in the courts for a verdict
 uske faisle ke liye kisi jaj ke paas do minute kaa vakt nahin he
 His wait for decision is short
 tees chalis saal main jaj sahab kaa wo do minute mil jaae, uske liye hota he
 Will the solution come out of making a list of cases or is this question very easy by increasing the number of judges
 jawaab aap khud dijie
 The condition of Uttar Pradesh is worse
 pashchim uttar pradesh ke log kab se apane liye ek bench kii maang kar rahe hai
 Everything is sold from here on its way to Lucknow and Allahabad
 chif justise kii baat main yah bhi shaamil he ki adaalaton kii suvidhaon or dhaanchon par bhi dhyaan dena hoga
 a farmer in Meerut is saddened by how a lawsuit changed his life
 meerut se elahabaad hai court ke chakkar ne use barbaad kar diya he
 If you go to any court, you will feel that you have come to the hospital
 10 lakh kii aabaadi par bharat main jajon kii sankhya mushkil se 15 he
 The judges are so burdened with lawsuits that it takes 20-30 years before the decision comes
 na ilaaj time paras na insaaf time par
 One jumla of the judiciary's world has been so weakened that it has no meaning
 aap jaanate bhi hai
 Justice Delayed Justice Denied
 insaaf main deree ninsaafi he
 When you are so knowledgeable, then who should be punished for that injustice
 insaaf maangane vaale ko di jaae yaa dene vaale ko di jaae
 Many Chief Justices have already mentioned the shortage of judges in India
 2003 main jaipur main lok adaalaton ke sammelan main bolte hue tab ke bharat ke chif justise ve en khare ne kaha tha, adaalaton main backlog kaaphi lanbaa hota ja rahaa he
 Infrastructure is very weak
 jajon kii sankhya kam he
 There are 135 judges in the US with a population of 1 million, in India there are 13 judges on a population of 1 million
 swasthy loktantr ke liye majboot nyaaypalika bahut zaruri he
 Someone must have said before 2003 but 2016 has come
 aapako lagata he ki bich ke pradhan nyaayadhish is masale ko bhul gaye honge
 In 2004, the then Chief Justice of India, Justice RC Lahoti, held that the lack of judges had been blamed for the pending cases
 tribune kii report ke anusaar justise lahoti ne hai court ke mukhya nyayadhishon se kaha tha ki wo nichali adaalaton par nazar rakhen taaki mukademon kii sunwaayee samay se hoti rahe
 You must be thinking that in 2003, 2004, the Chief Justice would have talked about the shortage of judges, then the governments must have come into action
 paanch saal baad 2009 main chif justise ke ji balakrishnan ne 26 nanvabar ko rashtriya kanoon diwas ke maukey par kaha tha ki 2008 main 1
 8 crore new case files were filed, which shows how much confidence people have in the judiciary
 14,000 jajon ne 1 karod 70 lakh mukademon ko nipta bhi diya tha
 Meaning a judge handles 1200 cases in a year
 jajon kii kami or buniyadi dhaanchon kii kami ke baad bhi yah kaam karke dikhaaya gaya he
 In 2008, 40 million cases were heard in Indian courts
 yah aankada duniya ke kisi bhi desh kii adaalat se kai guna zyada he
 This is why it takes many years to complete the trial of the cases
 justise balakrishnan ne kaha tha ki jajon kii itani kami he ki ek jaj ko ek cese par nazar daalane ke liye 25 minute se zyaada nahin milte
 Don't you fear doctor ke paas line
 Line near the judge
 builder ke paas bhi line
 There too, people are facing delays of four years in getting flats
 25 minute ek cese ke liye
 The judge must be working faster than a computer
 yah sab sochate-vichaarte 2016 aa gaya
 Sunday was the day and the opportunity was in the Annual Chief Minister and Chief Justice Conference that the current Chief Justice of India repeats what his former Chief Justice has said
 unhone angrezi main jo kuch kaha, uskaa hindi anuwaad kuch is tarah he- bharat main jajon kii sankhya 7675 se badhaakar 40,357 karne kii zarurat he
 The number of judges should increase from 10 to 50 on a population of one million
 1987 main lau kamishan ne desh main 40,000 hazaar jajon kaa suzav diya tha
 But nothing happened
 2002 main pranab mukherjee ke netritv main sansad kii sthaayee samiti ne bhi kaha tha ki jajon kii sankhya bahut kam he
 There are only ten judges in India with a population of one million
 sthaayee samiti ne suzav diya ki ise 10 se 50 kiya jaae
 The appointment of 50 judges on 10 lakhs makes the number of judges in the country to 40,000
 lekin kuch nahin hua
 On 21 February 2013, Chief Justice Altamas Kabir wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but nothing happened
 chif justise tii es thakur nyaaypalika ke har str par jajon kii kami ko lekar bhavuk nahin the
 Were aggressive
 kehete ja rahe the ki hamane har str par charchaa kii he ki nichali adaalaton main jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaani chahie
 The number of judges in the High Court should be increased
 hamane is par charchaa kii or sahamat hue ki subah or shaam kii adaalaton ko shuru karnaa hoga or iske liye sevanivrutt jajon kii madad lee jaae
 Something special will have to be done for under trial in jails for 10 years
 hamane har str par charchaa kii he or sahamat hue hai ki nichali adaalaton or hai court main koi bhi cese paanch saal se zyada purana na ho
 They were going to say that we have discussed for this matter, for that matter
 sahamat hote rahe hai
 They have also discussed that they will use all the grants received under the 14th Finance Commission
 main jaanata hum ki aap vakil nahin hai lekin is desh ke pradhanmantri ke rup main aap jaanate honge ki 1950 main supreme court kii shuruuaat 8 jajon se hui thi
 Then there were only 1215 cases
 hamane ek jaj par 100 mukademon se apni shuruyaat kii thi
 Within a decade, the number of judges increased to 14 and the cases were 3247
 1986 main supreme court main 26 jaj ho gaye or cese kii sankhya ho gai 27,881
 At present, our capacity is 31 and the number of cases is 77,151 till 2014, the number of cases pending against 31 judges was 81,583 which we have reduced to 60,260
 chif justise ne is maukey kaa acha istemaal kiya taaki logon kaa dhyaan jajon kii kami par jaae
 He also told how the number of pending cases has decreased even after the shortage of judges in the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki adaalaton main mukademon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi he
 Today 38 lakh 68 thousand cases are pending in the High Court
 434 jajon kii vekency bhari jaani chahie
 Chief Justice said, 'he used to ask the question that if a road is constructed by 5 men in 10 days, if the same road is to be built in a day then how many people are needed
 or uttar hota tha, 50 aadmi chahie
 3868000 How many men are needed to settle the case
 kitne jaj chahie
 Why don't we understand this? ' paanchavin paas ko samajhane ke andaaz main unhone samajha to diya lekin kisi kaa dhyaan us aadmi kii taraf nahin gaya jise jajon kii kami kaa shikaar hona hota he
 Various high profile conferences are held around the country on judiciary issues
 jisamen kabhi mukhyamantri to kabhi pradhanmantri to kabhi chif justise jate rahete hai
 Such a thing is being said in every conference but it has been said for a decade and a half, yet there are not enough reforms
 isi march maheene main khud pradhanmantri ne patna hoicourt kii sthapana ke shatabdi samaaroh main lambit mukademon ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii thi
 In Patna, the Prime Minister said that i have a suggestion, and this idea has just come to me that our courts should bring a bulletin every year highlighting the oldest cases
 kuch chalis saal ke bhi ho sakate hai kuch 50 saal ke bhi ho sakate hai
 This will create a sensibility among the people as to how many cases are pending
 isse ek maahaul banegaa ki kaise in baaki mukademon kaa hal nikaala jaae
 The atmosphere has been created for decades pending information on pending cases
 aae din akhabaaron main report aati he
 Discussions are held in conferences
 sawaal he jajon kii niyukti yaa sankhya badhegi yaa nahin yaa sirf samvedansheeltaa yaa jaagarukta se isamen sudhaar aa jayega
 According to the report of 26 October 2009 Hindu newspaper, then Law Minister Veerappa Moily had said that all the pending cases will be put on the National Grid on 30 November 2009
 neshnal greed par lambit mukademon kaa puraa aankada he
 If you search by the name of NJDG, National Judicial Data Grid, then a page will open on which you will get the list of all the cases till date
 hamane somvaar shaam tak kaa data dekha to There are 22 lakh 58 thousand 441 pending cases in India over 10 years
 5 se 10 saal ke bich main lambit mukademon kii sankhya he 38 lakh, 28 hazaar 117
 It is obvious that we are available to know about the pending cases
 neshnal data greed ke alaava i court kii site par jaakar aap puure desh kii tamaam adaalaton ke mukademon kii sthiti on line dekh sakate hai
 National grid or e-court is for information, but whether these facilities can fill the shortage of judges
 chif justise ne saaf-saaf kaha ki upaay yahi he ki jajon kii sankhya badhaai jaae
 It did not take two months to approve the names we have sent
 koi aapatti he to sidhe hamase baat kii jaae kyonki jajon ko niyukt karne vaali colegium ne lambii prakriya ke tahat naamon ko final kiya he
 In 2010, the Center had decided that a National Litigation Policy would be brought under which states were to reduce the number of their government lawsuits, but according to the final notice of 2015, the cabinet is considering it
 march main hi elahabaad court kii 150veen jayanti ke maukey par raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne kaha tha ki insaaf main deree ninsaphi he
 The number of judges should be increased and vacant posts should be filled quickly
 ham jaananaa chaahate the ki jaj vaaki kitna kaam karte hai
 Our colleague Ashish Bhargava found out at his level how much work a Supreme Court judge has to do
 kaash ki ham kisi jaj kii puri dincharya camere se shoot karte or aapako dikhaa pate
 i could not believe hearing that the judge could not do any work other than work
 saans kaise lete honge iske liye kisi ko janhit yachika daayar kerani chahie
 Ashish told that a judge has to work for 18 hours daily
 subah das se shaam chaar baje tak court main rahete hai
 After this, go home and rest for one and a half hours
 phir agle din ke mukademon kii taiyaari main lag jate hai
 Every lawsuit has to be seen on file
 koi file 100 pej kii hoti he to koi pachaas pej kii
 Decision between this also has to be dictated
 saadhe gyaarah baje tak sone jate hai or paanch baje uth jate hai
 The judges love walking
 tahalne ke baad subah saat se saadhe aath baje tak phir cese kii taiyaari karte hai
 He leaves for court around half past nine
 kai jaj shanivaar or ravivaar ke din bhi der raat tak kaam karte hai
 In addition to filing cases, listening to the cases filed, writing judgments, they also have other administrative functions
 unki puri kshamta is baat par aanki jaati he ki kitni tezi se ve cese ko sun lete hai, samaj lete hai or faisla dete hai
 The promotion of judges of lower courts depends on how many cases have been dealt
 kya koi jaj ek din main 50 file pard saktaa he
 Judges work from seven in the morning to 11 in the night, then on the day of the holiday
 to kya yah thik he ki unki chuttee par nazar daali jaae
 Chief Justice TS Thakur said that we do not just go to Manali
 jo sanvaidhanik peeth ke jaj hote hai wo apane faisle likh rahe hote hai
 If one side is ready then the other side is not ready
 baar se poochhate hai ki kya wo taiyaar hai
 There is a three-week holiday
 is dauraan bhi kuch jaj mukademon ko sunate hai
 The question is whether the number of judges will be eliminated by the termination of leave
 40 hazaar jaj chahie
 There are close to eight thousand judges
 kya is kami ko teen yaa chaar hafte kii chuttee ghataakar puri kii ja sakati he
 Is it possible for a judge to look at the file of twenty cases in a day
 use donon pakshon ko sunakar, kanoon padhakar faisla likhnaa hota he
 Shakespeare also has to be coached in between
 ab samaj aayaa ki hamaare jaj log shakespeare ko hi kyon kot karte rahete hai
 No one else will have time to study
 america ke supreme court main 9 jaj hai
 In all, a decision has to be given in 81 cases in a year
 bharat main ek jaj ausat 2600 mukademon ko sunata he, faisla detaa he
 The Chief Justice said that when the judges come from outside, we are surprised to see
 7 april ko pradeep thakur ne 'times of india' main likhaa he ki ek adhyayan ke anusaar hai court ke jaj ke paas ek mukademe ke liye bas paanch yaa chah minute hi hote hai
 This is the first time such a study has taken place
 jo sabase vyast jaj hai yani jiske paas bahut cese hai uske paas ek cese ko sunne ke liye sirf dhai minute hai
 The one who is least busy has only 15 to 16 minutes
 paanch se chah minute main unhen faisla dena hota he
 Daksha is an institution in Bangalore, he has done this study
 misaal ke taur par kolkata hai court main har din ek jaj ke paas 163 mukademe sunwaayee ke liye aate hai
 The same time is two minutes for a case
 patna, hyderabad, jharkhand, rajasthan ke jajon ke paas har din ek cese ke liye do se teen minute miltaa he
 Is 619 judges of higher and higher offices sufficient for a population of one billion 25 crore
 tippaniyan Anyone would feel that someone is joking with him
 aap sochiye ki aapke saath koun mazaaq kar rahaa he
 After all, why did the governments not increase the number of judges
 adaalaton main suvidhaayen kyon nahin badhaai
 Who is keeping you away from justice
 ek aadmi adaalaton main chalis chalis saal faisle ke liye intazaar karata he
 No judge has two minutes to make his decision
 uskaa intazaar faisle ke liye kam hota he
 If you get that two minutes of your judge in thirty forty years, it is for him
 kya iskaa samaadhaan mukademon kii suchi banane se nikalegaa yaa jajon kii sankhya badhaane se yah sawaal to bahut aasaan he
 Please answer yourself
 uttar pradesh kii haalat to or buree he
 People of western Uttar Pradesh have been demanding a bench for themselves since
 yahaan se lakhanu or elahabaad jate jate sabakuch bik jaataa he
 The Chief Justice also included that the facilities and structures of the courts also have to be taken care of
 meerut ke ek kisaan kii vyathaa he ki ek mukademe ne uski zindagi kis tarah se badal di
 The Allahabad High Court affair with Meerut has ruined him
 2003 se pehle bhi kisi ne kaha hi hoga lekin ye 2016 aa gaya he
 You think the Chief Justice of the middle must have forgotten this issue
 2004 main bharat ke tab ke pradhan nyaayadhish ne justise aar si lahoti ne kaha ki lambit mukademon ke liye jajon kii kami ko doshi tehraaya tha
 According to the report of the Tribune, Justice Lahoti had asked the Chief Justices of the High Court to keep an eye on the lower courts so that the trial of the cases would continue in time
 aap soch rahe honge ki 2003, 2004 main chif justise ne jajon kii kami kii baat kii hogi to sarkarein harakat main aa hi gayi hongi
 Five years later, in 2009, Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan said on November 26 on the occasion of National Law Day that in 2008, 1
 8 karod nae cese file hue the jisase pataa chalata he ki logon kaa nyaaypalika main kitna vishwaas he
 14,000 judges had also dealt with 17 million cases
 matlab ek jaj ek saal main 1200 maamalon ko nipta detaa he
 This has been shown to work even after the shortage of judges and lack of infrastructure
 2008 main bhartiya adaalaton main 4 karod 80 lakh mukademon kii sunwaayee hui
 This figure is many times more than the court of any country in the world
 yahi kaaran he ki mukademon kii sunwaayee puri hone main kai saal lag jate hai
 Justice Balakrishnan had said that there is such a shortage of judges that a judge does not get more than 25 minutes to look at a case
 kya aapako dar nahin lagata he
 Line to the doctor
 jaj ke paas line
 Line near builder too
 vahaan bhi logon ko flats milane main chaar saal kii deree kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 25 minutes for a case
 jaj sahab computer se bhi tej kaam karte honge

 The Chief Justice made good use of this opportunity so that the attention of the people goes to the shortage of judges

 The Chief Justice clearly stated that the solution is to increase the number of judges
 jo naam hamane bheje hai unhen manzur karne main do-do maheene na lage
 If there is any objection, talk to us directly because the collegium which appointed the judges has finalized the names as part of the long process
 2010 main centre ne tay kiya tha ki ek rashtriya litigeshan niti laai jaaegi jiske tahat rajyon ko apane sarkari mukademon kii sankhya kam kerani thi lekin 2015 tak kii antim soochna ke hisaab se is par cabinut vichaar kar rahi he

 ashish ne bataaya ki ek jaj ko rozaana 18 ghante kaam karnaa padataa he
