 Delhi Police Headquarters has offices from Delhi Police Commissioner to all officers
 isi police mukhyalay kii 10 veen manzil se 28 november kii subah asipi prem ballab ne kudakar aatmahatya kar lee thi
 As soon as the incident was known, the whole police headquarters was stirred up
 pehle yah maamla ek saamaanya suicide kaa tha lekin ab maamle main nayaa mode aa gaya he
 acp's brother Harish Sharma has received a pen drive of ACP, which has put the Delhi Police Department in a circle of questions in the suicide of ACP
 san 1986 main bataur head consteble dilli police main bhartee prem ballab ko saal 2016 main raashtrapati award se nawaja gaya tha
 According to Harish Sharma, what Prem Ballabh wrote in his note written on the computer just a day before his suicide, he has brought two inspectors of the department, a sub-inspector and an ASI into the dock
 prem ballab ne note main likhaa tha, "ASI OP or SI vinod or AC-1 (inder pal)ne mujhe kai baar kai maukon par miss guide kiya he kyonki meraa swabhaav yakeen karne kaa he
 As soon as i came to know about it
 isane mujhe stress / strain / or depressant main dhakel diya
 Because of this my hyper depression increased
 jaise taise karke maine ise sambhala, isse main ladaa
 Now i have completely failed to control my depression
 jisaki vajah se mere oficial parformens par bhi iskaa asar pad rahaa he kyonki maine neend kii davaaiyaan leni shuru kar di
 This depression occurred to me from people working in C&T branch, one of which is Inspector Ramlal
 jo bahut hi kaning he or mere mukaable unka record bhi acha nahin he
 He has been transferred several times in the last three to four years
 main pehle unhen apana dost samajhataa tha kyonki ham ek saath kaam karte the
 i have helped him many times, i also helped him on the issue of his marriage
 main apane parivaar se maafee chahta hum
 i expect him to control his feelings

 jab main 2nd Bn main or piechakue main tha to maine viares lene kii koshish bhi kii
 But i could not succeed in doing so as some of my loved ones advised me and i withdrew my decision to take VRS
 maine piechakue main kai saare kadam uthaae viares lene kii koshish kii lekin senior adhikariyon ne mujhe aisa naa karne kii salaah di
 If i had taken VRS, i would not have worked this way but what can be done now
 jeepies, graduati, pension extra dilaane main mere parivaar kii madad karen
 My mother, my brother, my sister and my daughter are completely innocent
 in sabhi ne mujhe samajhane kii koshish kii, bahut baar inhone mujhe samajhaayaa
 But i could not come out of depression
 main apane parivaar ko mere depressant ke kaarnon ke bare main bhi nahin bataa saktaa agar ham jindagi ko khushi se nahin ji sakate to phir udaasi main jindagi kis kaam kii
 Depression and staying depressed sometimes brings bad results
 isse zyada main bardaasht nahin kar saktaa
 i feel that due to the nature of trusting more and more devotion towards work, i moved towards this state
 main zyada sochane laga or depressant kaa shikaar ho gaya
 In my job time, i have never stolen work, i have never had any medical complaint of any kind
 sirf jo ki pichley 28 dinon se he
 i know that i will be held responsible for every single mistake in my branch
 lekin aap se nivedan he ki mere parivaar ko pareshaan naa karen kyonki vah pehle se hi pareshaan hai tinkaa tinkaa karke ghar ko joda tha magar sab bikhar gaya"harish ke mutabik khudakushi se pehle asipi prem ballab ne 58 reword par hastakshar kiye the

 Former Chief Justice RM Lodha delivered several landmark decisions in the Supreme Court
 ipel phixing par aayaa faisla bhi kai myanon main aitihaasik rahaa, jaahir he ki is maamle main supreme court kii bench ne justise lodha ko iske liye chunaa tha
 It has been two years for me to cover the Supreme Court, but in this way, such a big decision on such a big issue was first heard live in cameras
 justise lodha apni team ke saath ek baje ke vakt ke liye sava baarah baje hi india hebitate centre pahunch gaye the
 He then arrived at the Silver Oak 2 Hall shortly before 1pm
 media ke camaron ne unhen chaaron taraf se ghere liya
 Loud voices started coming
 lekin, justise lodha ne saaf kar diya ki unhen shanti chahie
 He also said that it is one o'clock, now is the time for decision
 iske baad unhone apane faisle ko sunaanaa shuru kar diya or saare channelon ne iskaa live prasaaran bhi kiya
 Usually, when the Supreme Court's decision comes, the situation is different
 court main mobile phone le jane kii anumati nahin hoti, lihaaja sab patrkaar bheetar jaj kaa faisla sunate hai
 Let's note
 iske baad baahar aakar sab apane aphis main faisle ko bhejte hai
 Sometimes the judges speak so slowly that the whole verdict is not heard properly
 aise main idhar udhar se poochtacha kerani hoti he
 But, there was nothing like this here
 baqayda mike main justise lodha ne puraa jajment padhaa
 Every one spoke a word that reached the public directly through cameras
 kahin koi confayujan nahin
 Just like the Supreme Court, Justice Lodha, Justice Ashok Bhan and Justice Ravindran signed it
 baad main isaki copy vakeelon ko saunp di
 He even answered media questions later
 ye bhi bataaya ki aage wo kya karne vaale hai
 In some other decisions, there were calls from the newsroom several times
 kuch sawaalon ke jawaab maange jate the
 But, this time it did not happen
 tippaniyan Justice Lodha kept speaking and breaking news continued
 haalanki, pehle unhone is jajment main camaron kii maujuudagi se inkaar kiya tha, lekin baad main wo taiyaar ho gaye the
 However, this hall was quite small but, due to the media crowd, the second part of the hall was also opened
 yahaan ek or dilachasp ghatana bhi hui
 There was a meal outside the hall itself
 coffee thi or mineral water kii bottlen bhi rakhi thi
 Everyone felt that the panel would give the verdict first and then have lunch
 lage haath mineral water kii botalon se mediakarmiyon ne pani bhi piya
 Emptied more than 100 bottles
 justise lodha apane panel ke saath aae or jajment sunaaya phir chale gaye
 Many thought that lunch would now be opened
 lekin, do ghante tak bhi aisa nahin hua
 Later it was discovered that there was another program going on there and it was his lunch
 aamtaur par kaarykram ke baad haul khaali ho jaataa he, lekin yahaan media ke log teen ghante tak jame rahe
 This is not over yet, because Justice Lodha has said, further action is going on, we will meet again after some time

 This is not over yet, because Justice Lodha has said, further action is going on, we will meet again after some time
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki ek baj gaya he ab faisle kaa vakt he
 After that he started narrating his decision and all the channels also broadcast it live
 aamtaur par jab supreme court main is taraha kaa faisla aata he to halaat alag hote hai
 Mobile phones are not allowed in the court, so all journalists hear the decision of the judge inside
 note karte hai
 After this, everyone comes out and sends the decision to their office
 kai baar jaj itnaa dhimaa bolte hai ki sara faisla sahi se sunai nahin detaa
 In such a situation, one has to inquire from here and there
 lekin, yahaan aisa kuch nahin tha
 In Justice Mike Lodha read the entire Judgment

 There is no confusion anywhere
 supreme court kii tarah hi justise lodha, justise ashok bhaan or justise ravindran ne is par sin kiye
 Later, its copy was handed over to the lawyers

 He also told what he was going to do next
 kisi or faisle main kai baar newsroom se kol aati thi
 Answers to some questions were sought
 lekin, is baar aisa nahin hua
 The comments justise lodha bolte rahe or braking news chalati rahi
 Although, earlier he denied the presence of cameras in this judgment, but later he agreed
 haalanki, ye haul kaaphi chota tha lekin, baad main media kii bheed ko dekhte hue haul kaa doosraa hissaa bhi khol diya gaya
 Another interesting incident also happened here
 haul ke baahar hi khaane kaa intjaam tha
 Had coffee and also kept bottles of mineral water
 sabhi ko laga panel pehle faisla sunayega or iske baad lunch karaayega
 Mediamen also drank water from bottles of hand-held mineral water
 kareeb 100 se zyada bottlen khaali kar di
 Justice Lodha came with his panel and pronounced the Judgment and then left
 kai logon ne sochaa ab lunch kholaa jayega
 However, it did not happen even for two hours
 baad main pataa chalaa ki vahiin par koi or kaarykram chal rahaa tha or ye lunch uskaa tha
 The hall is usually empty after the program, but the media persons here remained frozen for three hours
 abhi ye yahi khatm nahin hua, kyonki justise lodha ne kaha he, aage kii karrwai chal rahi he, kuch vakt ke baad phir milenge

 bollywood ke 'sho main' kahe jane vaale divangat actor-diarector raaj kapur kii jindagi main tamaam- utaar chadhaav aae
 The family in which Raj Kapoor was born was a big name in Bollywood, but one truth is that the heights he touched in his career were only due to his hard work and ability
 bataa den ki raaj kapur kaa janm 14 disambar, 1924 ko peshawar (pakistan) main hua tha
 Kamaraj Kapoor, a spotboy in a production company, started working at the age of 17 as 'ranjith Moviecom' and 'bombay Talkies' film production company Spotboy
 prithvi raaj kapur jaisi hasti ke ghar janm lene ke baad bhi raaj kapur ne bollywood main kadaa sangharsh kiya
 The beginning had not been so easy for him
 aapako jaanakar hairaani hogi ki raaj kapur ke filmi kariyar kii shuruyaat ek chaante ke saath hui thi

 bhartiya samskruti ke anadi kaal se anantkaal tak ke pravaah kii sakshi ganga ko phir se aviral nirmal or satat pravaah ke kaarykram namaami gange kaa aglaa charan ab uma bharti kii ganga kinare padayatra ke rup main hoga
 On one hand, the government, ngos and the public will work together to clean the Ganga and rejuvenate the Ganga, on the other hand, the Minister of Water Resources and Ganga Rejuvenation Uma Bharti will undertake a two-or-three-day trek to the banks of the Ganges from Gomukh to Gangasagar every week for two years
 bharti kaa kahana he ki is tarah kadam dar kadam napate hue vogangaore gangaputron kii mushkilen aasaani se samaj paaengi
 Then it will be more possible to take permanent measures
 taaki 2018 main ganga ko phir se svachh, nirmal or aviral karne kaa lakshya paa saken
 Pledge can be realized
 yani iske liye act bhi banegaa to wo janata kii ichha ke mutabik
 Especially according to the wishes of the people living on the banks of the Ganges because they understand the Ganges better than most and are sensitive too
 uma bharatine kaha ki wo or unka mantralay ganga yamuna or anya nadiyon par power project banane ke khilaaf katai nahin he
 Yes, we have a request for design
 dam or baraj kaa dizin aisa ho jisase nadi kii aviralata or nirmalata par koi asar naa pade
 Nor should there be any threat to biodiversity
 maidani ilaakon main nadiyon kaa prabandhan behatar hona chahie
 Like, the old tradition of making Nadya Taal on the banks of rivers has been in India
 taaki apshisht sidhe nadi main naa jane paae
 Organic farming should be done in the coastal villages of the Ganges, institutions for breeding and breed improvement of animals should be established
 paudhe lagane yani vanikaran bhi jaruri he
 Because without it, the natural flow and form of any river cannot be returned
 sabase badi kranti to ye aane vaali he ki naalon or siver kaa pani treet kar ab sarkaar piesu sansthaanon ko bechegi
 For this, mous will be prepared from large institutions like NTPC at Narora, Railway Plant at Benaras, Indian Oil Refinery at Mathura
 jaldi hi nijee audyogic gharaanon se bhi baat hogi ki wo trited pani khariden or uskaa istemaal apane kaarkaanon main karen
 This will save the life of the river as well as use the water again
 agle maheene hoga 1650 panchayaton kaa sammelanjal sansaadhan mantri ne kaha ki sarkaar ko jitna paisa kharch karnaa tha wo to kar chuki
 Now the achievement of the target will not be sustainable until there is no involvement of ngos, ie ngos and general public in the projects
 janata kii rukh jaananaa jaruri he
 So that it can be known how to stop the tampering of Ganga
 sajaa kitni or kya ho
 Therefore, the conference of sarpanches of 1650 panchayats of 6000 villages situated along the Ganges in five states will be held in Allahabad next month
 isamen ganga or anya nadiyon kii safai sunishchit karne vaale act kii ruparekha par bhi charchaa hogi
 So that the public and panchayats decide the nature of the project and the action plan, not the officer
 isi silsile main 26 agast ko varanasi main ganga ke donon kinare based gaanvon main chaar jagah ganga panchayat hogi
 Ten Ganga Smart Cities will also be set up in cities situated along the Ganges so that there is healthy competition and on the same pretext, there is a competition to create awareness among the people and become smart in cities
 isi bich niri bhi apni report dene vaala he jisamen ye adhyayan kiya gaya he ki gomukh se gangasagar tak gangaajal kii quality main kab kab kahaan kahaan or kaisaa kaisaa badlaav aa rahaa he
 And what is the reason
 isse samasyaon ke mutabik hi samaadhaan karne main bhi aasaani hogi
 Since the problems are different everywhere
 kahin audyogic hai
 Somewhere in the city is garbage
 kahin jameen main hi arsenic kii maatra zyada he to kahin rasayanon kii bharmaar he
 Ministry of City Development for this
 gramin vikaas mantralay, urja mantralay or rasayan mantralay ke saath van or paryaavaran mantralay sahit aath mantralayon kii nitiyon or adhikariyon ke bich bhi talmail jaruri he
 In such a situation, the Ministry of Ganga Rejuvenation can play an intermediary role in it
 siem offison main lagaae ja rahe hai real time monitob ganga kinare vanikaran kii baat ho to aam janata apane purvajon kii yaad main yaadgaar dinon or tithiyon par apni nampattica ke saath paudhe lagaaein or unki dekhbhaal karen
 Companies and industrial houses beautify the banks of the Ganges and other rivers with their nameplates as well as permanent care
 sarkaar unako suvidha degi lekin kharch or rakrakhaav enjio, audyogic gharaane yaa aam janata khud kare
 At present, real-time monitors are being installed in the offices of the Chief Ministers and Chief Secretaries of the five states, in which the data of pollution in the Ganges and major rivers will continue to come up
 2200 karod rupee ke project manjuurganga punaruddhar kaaryakramon main ab rahi baat kharch or aamadani kii
 So for this Uma Bharti said that the CAG should audit our plans continuously
 jab chaahe sieji hamase koi bhi detail maang saktaa he
 We will provide happiness
 kyonki sarkaar ne ganga main jaev vividhta barkaraar rakhane ke liye 2200 karod rupee kii yojana manjuur kii he
 63 crores has been allocated for improving Sisamau drain in Kanpur, 397 crores for networking, Rs 100 crores for beautification of Ganga coast in Bithoor
 yani ganga punerjeevan ke liye chal rahe 99 projects sahit kul 20 hajaar karod rupee kii pariyojnaayen chal rahi hai
 Hence monitoring is necessary
 uma bharti ne bataaya ki in yojanaon par amal ke liye yogadan karne kii ichha jataane waalon main shri shri ravishankar, swami ramdev, kaashi main gyanavapi ke imam, patna sahib ke jatthedaar, kai ritred afasar, chuttee main skool kalejon ke chaatr yogadan karne ko utsuk hai
 mous will be signed for management of treated water
 Government work is also going ahead
 17 agast ko mathura, 19 agast ko kanpur, 20 agast ko varanasi or elahabaad main trited water ke prabandhan ko lekar emoyu par dastakhat honge
 That is, these programs are being announced for the last two years
 ab wo sataha par aa rahe hai
 The target is 2018
 kyonki 2019 main aam chunaav bhi to hai
 Now the Ganges first becomes clear or policy, intention or decision

 The petitioners say that how the investigation was completed in three days? Why was Judge Loya taken to the same hospital, why not another? He was rushed to the hospital by auto
 jabaki sachai yah he ki unhen saathi jaj kii car se aspataal le jaaya gaya tha
 The petitioners are creating concocted stories

 The petitions request a fair inquiry into the death of Judge Loya

 There is now a new revelation about the controversy that arose after the police headquarters recalled the house guards provided to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 lalu kii suraksha vaapasi ke baad se hi purv mukhyamantri rabari devi or unke donon bete tej pratap or tejasvi yadav aag babula hai
 To express their displeasure, the trio on Wednesday sent them back to the security personnel provided by the government and said they did not want their services
 haalanki, buudhvaar shaam ko police mukhyalay ne ek press conference karke is baat kaa khulaasa kar diya ki aakhirlalu and familidwara suraksha main kami ko lekar vivaad paidaa karnaa kitna bemaani he
 AD Singhal of Police Headquarters SK Singhal first clarified that the lack of security was done only by Lalu Prasad Yadav and not Rabri Devi and her sons
 ediji singhl ne bataaya ki jail main hone ke kaaran lalu prasad yadav ab 10, circular road awaas par nahin rahete hai isiilie police mukhyalay dwaara unhen jo suraksha pradaan kii gai thi, use waapas kar liya gaya he jinaki sankhya 15 he
 Singhal said that 3 Havildars and 12 soldiers of Bihar Military Police provided to Lalu have been recalled
 haalanki, jail main hone ke baavjood lalu ke paas ab bhi bihar police ke teen padaadhikari or centre sarkaar dwaara jed plus suraksha milane kii vajah se kendriya rigerv police bal ke 10 commando 10, circular road awaas main maujuud hai
 After giving clarification on Lalu's safety, ADG Singhal opened up about the security of Rabri Devi, Tej Pratap and Tejasvi
 ediji ne bataaya ki kaise kal tak bihar police ke 100 se bhi zyada jawan lalu and family kii suraksha main 24 ghante tainaat rahete the magar ab lalu kii suraksha waapas lene ke baad isamen thodi kami ai he
 The first thing was former Chief Minister Rabri Deviki
 ediji ne bataaya ki rabari devi ko jed plus shrenee or special security group act 2010 adhinium ke tahat angrakshak, payalat, escort, house guard, nigaraanee hetu pulicekarmi, jaanch hetu pulicekarmi, bullate pruf car samet 36 surakshakarmi adhikrut hai magar vartmaan main unke paas 56 surakshakarmi hai
 Now the leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav spoke
 netaa pratipaksh hone kii haisiyat se tejasvi yadav 17 surakshakarmi, jisamen 7 angrakshak or 10 house guard hote hai, rakhane ke liye adhikrut hai magar vartmaan main tejasvi ke paas kul 27 surakshakarmi hai
 Now it is the talk of Tej Pratap Yadav, former health minister and elder son of Lalu
 tejpratap ab sirf vidhayak hai or vidhayak hone kii haisiyat se vah keval 3 angrakshakon ke liye adhikrut hai magar vartmaan main unke paas 10 surakshakarmi hai
 Currently, if Rabri Devi (56), Tejashwi Yadav (27), Tej Pratap Yadav (10) and Lalu Yadav's remaining security personnel (13) are added, then Lalu's absence still protects his wife and both sons
 106 security personnel are deployed
 magar itani suraksha ke baavjood bhi rabari devi or unke donon bete suraksha main kami ko lekar hai tauba machaa rahe hai or mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par aarope laga rahe hai ki vah unki hatya karaane kii sajeesh rach rahe hai
 Samajwadi Party leader, close to Mulayam and a minister in the Akhilesh government, Ambika Chaudhary joined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) on Saturday
 choudhary ko ek samvaadadaata sammelan ke dauraan basapa pramukh mayawati ne party kii sadsyta dilaai
 He will contest from his traditional assembly seat Ballia's Fafna
 is seat par haalanki vah 2012 main haar gaye the or baad main sapa ne unhen vidhaan parishad sadsy banaaya tha
 Actually, Ambika Chaudhary was considered close to Mulayam
 haal ke dinon main sapa main andruni kalah ke dauraan wo hameshaa mulaayam ke saath khadey dikhe the
 Mayawati said, 'I have taken him (chaudhary) into the party and he will be given more respect than SP here
 saath hi unhen baliya jile kii unki puraani seat se hi vidhansabha chunaav ladaaya jayega'
 Ambika Chaudhary said, 'I have resigned from the primary membership of SP and all the posts related to it
 main puri tarah samarpit hokar basapa ke saath aage kii raajnneeti main, jo disha-nirdesh party or bahanji (mayawati) kaa hoga, uske liye khud ko samarpit karata hum'
 The comments choudhary ne kaha, "mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne apane pita mulaayam singh yadav ke saath pichley do maheene main jo kiya vah acha nahin tha
 There the purpose behind all this gimmick was something else
 ham basapa main shaamil ho rahe hai, taaki upra main 2017 main sampradayik shaktiyon ko satta main aane se roka ja sake
 " unhone kaha ki vah mulaayam or shivpal yadav donon ke kareeb the, lekin samaajawaadee party main jo kuch hua, vah acha nahin tha
 Socialists have lost their way
 akhilesh kii ore ishaara karte hue choudhary ne kaha ki jab ek betaa apane pita ke saath is tarah kaa bartaav karata he to iske baad or kuch kehane ko kya bachataa he? Chaudhary was given membership of the party by BSP chief Mayawati during a press conference
 wo apni paaramparik vidhansabha seat baliya ke fefna se hi chunaav ladenge
 He lost this seat in 2012 and was later made a member of the Legislative Council by the SP
 darasal, ambika choudhary mulaayam ke qareebi maane jate the
 In recent times, he was always standing with Mulayam during internal squabbles in SP
 mayawati ne kaha, 'maine inhen (choudhary ko) party main liya he or unhen yahaan sapa se zyada aadar-sammaan diya jayega
 Also, he will be contesting the assembly elections from his old seat in Ballia district '
 ambika choudhary ne kaha, 'maine sapa kii praathmik sadsyta or usase sambandhit sabhi padon se istipha de diya he
 i fully dedicate myself to the direction the party and Behenji (mayawati) will have in the politics ahead with the BSP '
 tippaniyan Chaudhary said, "what Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav in the last two months was not good
 vahaan yah sab nautanki ke peeche kaa uddeshy hi kuch or tha
 We are joining the BSP to prevent communal forces from coming to power in UP in 2017
 " He said that he was close to both Mulayam and Shivpal Yadav, but what happened in the Samajwadi Party was not good
 samaajawaadee apni raah se bhatak gaye hai
 Pointing to Akhilesh, Chaudhary said that when a son treats his father like this, then what is left to say after this? darasal, ambika choudhary mulaayam ke qareebi maane jate the

 In order to bring normalcy after the firing at the main mosque of Christchurch in New Zealand, prayers were offered for the first time in the mosque on 23 March
 ab al nur masjid ko aajadobaaraa sthaneey muslim samudaay ko saunp diya gaya he or chote-chote samoohon ko dopaher baar bheetar jane kii anumati deni shuru kar di
 The police closed the mosque for investigation and security reasons after a person named Brenton Tarant fired on the Al Noor mosque
 iske alaava ek choti masjid par bhi 15 march ko golibari hui thi
 In this firing inside the mosques, 50 people were killed
 al nur main ek swayamsevak saiyad hasan ne kaha, ‘‘ ham ek baar main 15 logon ko bheetar jane kii manjuuri de rahe hai taaki sthiti saamaanya ho sake
 Vohra Mohammad Huzef was among the first to enter the mosque
 inhen bhi 15 march ko goli lagi thi
 a mother who came to New Zealand after hearing the news of the death of her son killed in an attack in Christchurch, also died on the night of 22 March
 vahiin ek or parijan kii maut hui he
 Confirming this, a police spokesman said that one of the relatives died due to shock and another was also killed
 haalanki pravaktaa ne kisi bhi maamle kii adhik jaankaree nahin di
 input language uttarakhand main vidhansabha chunaav kaa shor tej hone ke saath hi raajnneetik dalon ko daliton or musalamaanon ke kul 30 fisadi voton kii chintaa sataane lagi he
 Even though the issues of Dalits and Muslims have not yet become a political question, the uneasiness of grabbing their vote is clearly visible in all parties
 bhaajapa or congress to dalit voton ko rijhne ke liye kai sthanon par dalit sammelan bhi yojit kar chuki hai
 In the same year, the BJP organized a national conference of Muslims in Dehradun and tried to pull them into its court
 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv choudhary virendra singh to kisi dalit ko hi mukhyamantri banaae jane tak kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 The excited Dalits are seen with the Congress
 daliton main aashaa kii kiran yah bhi he ki congress ne party adhyaksh ke rup main yashpal arya ke haathon main kaman saunpi he
 The Congress led by Arya managed to win five Lok Sabha seats in the state
 pradesh main dalit matadaata paramparaagat rup se congress ke saath maane jate hai
 But the point is that till date both BJP and Congress have not been able to investigate Dalit issues
 satta kii baat ho to dalit hameshaa haashie par hi hote hai
 15 seats of the state assembly are reserved for the upcoming assembly elections, of which 13 seats are for the scheduled castes and 2 for the scheduled tribes
 vidambnaa yah he ki pradesh kii satta kii chaabi hameshaa usee ke haath lagi he, jiske saath sarvaadhik arakshit siton se jude janpratinidhi aate hai
 In the earlier government, 6 Congressmen had won from the reserved seats of Dalits and the Congress government was formed in the state
 isi prakaar is baar 6 bhaajapai daliton ke liye arakshit siton se jitkar aae or ab bhaajapa rajya main sarkaar chalaa rahi he
 State President of Scheduled Caste Cell of Congress, Dr
 jitram kaa kahana he ki daliton ko pradesh main abhi utana mahatv nahin mil paaya, jitne ke ve hakdaar hai
 But the mass rally in the Dalit rallies of the Congress is an indication that his faith is with the Congress
 jitram sawaal uthaate hai ki kya congress vaayade ke mutabik kisi dalit ko pradesh kii satta saunpegi? yah unke is party se jude rahane kii anivaary shart banegi
 Apart from the seats declared as safe in the state, Dalits are in a decisive position on more than half a dozen seats in the state
 congress ke pradesh sachiv sumer chand ravi kaa kahana he ki rajya kii 22 siton main dalit voter nirnaayak sthiti main hai
 In such a situation, apart from reserved seats, parties should give tickets to Dalits on general seats as well
 lekin hakeekat yah he ki koi dal surakshit siton ke alaava anya siton se dalit pratyaashiyon ko chunaav main nahin utaarna chahta
 Then no matter how educated or that candidate has been, he may not have been on a big post
 rajya vidhansabha ke spikar rah chuke arya, jo congress ke pradesh adhyaksh bhi hai, mukteshwar vidhansabha seat ke khatm hone kii vajah se maidan main jaakar surakshit seat se chunaav ladane ko majaboor hai
 Whereas they have so much base that they can win the election by fighting the general seat
 yahaan tak ki rajya ke ek cabinet mantri ko bhi isi sthiti kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Khajan Das, who won the reserved seat from Dhanaulti, is not being given a ticket from the BJP after that seat is normal
 khajaan das aagaamee chunaav dehradun kii surakshit raajpur seat se ladanaa chaahate hai
 According to Dalit thinker Mahesh Chandra Donia, "the Dalits of this state, which came into existence after the separate Uttarakhand state movement started against reservation, are expecting the Congress to rectify this political mistake this time
" ''uttarakhand samta andolan ne pehali baar dalit ghoshnaa patr taiyaar kiya he
 The convener of the Samata Movement, Prem Pancholi, says that many issues like entry of Dalits into temples, increasing violence with Dalits, vacancy of more than 15,000 posts despite reservation have been included in this manifesto
 daliton kii hi tarah rajya ke 12 fisadi muslim bhi rajnatik upeksha ke shikaar hai
 Despite the two general elections, the attitude of the parties towards Muslims has not changed
 haalanki rajya vidhansabha main pichley chunaav main chaar muslim vidhayak chunakar aae
 As the leader of the BSP State Legislature Party, the Muslim legislator also got command of the assembly, yet the Muslim representative has not yet got a chance to become a minister in the state
 bhaajapa ho yaa phir congress, kisi ne bhi is alpsankhyak samudaay ke pratinidhi ko mantri pad par nahin bithaaya
 Although all the plans for the development of minorities started during the Narayan Dutt Tiwari regime of the Congress, but no minority MLA was elected from the Congress and could not become a minister
 bhaajapa kii satta main bhi yahi alam rahaa
 The BJP has also been accused of scrapping the plans of Congress rule launched for the minorities
 nainital, udhamsingh nagar, haridwar or dehradun kii kai vidhansabha siton par musalamaanon kii sthiti prabhaavshaalee he
 Despite this, both major political parties have been reluctant to give him tickets
 congress main in chunaavon main haridwar, rudki ke piraan kaliyar evam dehradun jile kii sahaspur seat se muslimon ko tikat dene kaa dabaav he, lekin yah moort rup legaa, is par andeh he
 Qazi Nizamuddin from Mangalore as a Muslim MLA in BSP, Mu from Bahadarabad
 shahzad evam laldhang se haji taslim ahamed ko vidhayak ke rup main chune jane kaa mauka mila
 But being in opposition, the minority class could not take advantage of their election
 basapa ne to apane vidhanmandal dal kaa netaa bhi mohammad shahzad ko banaaya he
 Apart from these three, minorities did not get the opportunity to be elected as mlas of any other party

 Video: Today's 5 Big News video : aaj kii 5 badi khabaren When the india-sri Lanka Agreement was being finalized around 25 July (1987), i was asked to attend a meeting at 7 Race Course Road
 vahaan pataa chalaa ki bharat chahta tha ki samjhaute par colombo main 26 july ko dastakhat hon jabaki srilanka ko yah taarikh bahut jaldi kii lag rahi thi
 The Sri Lankan side wanted Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to agree to move the event to 29 July

 ) Prabhakaran was staying in the Ashoka Hotel — he later claimed that our government kept him under house arrest
 jaahir he, pradhanmantri kii usase mulaakaat hui thi
 My opinion was that the Prime Minister should not have met Prabhakaran
 baad main mere yah poochne par ki kya pradhanmantri ko altitii pramukh se likhaa-padhi main kuch mila tha, unhone chidhkar jawaab diya tha, “usne mujhe jubaan di he
 "I said that Prabhakaran's speech has no value
 usase likhit main rajamandi dene ke liye kaha janaa chahie tha
 He will double cross us when he gets a chance
 prabhakaran ne aisa ekaadhik baar kiya bhi
 It was mutually agreed that the agreement would be signed on July 29 in Colombo

 jayavardhane ne unase kaha ki yadi bharat fouran hi apni fouj srilanka nahin bhejtaa he to unhen ashanka he ki usee raat takhtapalat ho saktaa he
 i told the Prime Minister that it would be appropriate to return to Delhi on such a serious matter and take a decision only after consulting with my senior cabinet colleagues
 unhone bataaya ki ve bhartiya fouj ko hawaii jahaaj se tatkaal colombo bheje jane kaa aadesh de chuke the
 The ground reality was that India was going to be caught in the fire of the ethnic conflict of Sri Lanka
 bhartiya shanti sena (ipiceef) vahaan agast main pahunchi
 The hope was that we would be able to end the LTTE tomorrow, if not today
 thal senadhyaksh ne shekhi baghaari ki ve do hafte main altitii or prabhakaran se nipat lenge
 It was a stupid thing
 bhartiya shanti sena kisi spasht brifing yaa makasad ke bina hi ravaanaa ho gai thi
 The soldiers were neither told about the geography of the Jaffna Peninsula, nor about the ltte's hideout bases
 yah shankaa shuru se vyakt kii ja rahi thi ki july-agast 1987 main sampann bharat-srilanka samjhaute ke prati anicchhuk altitii ko kisi gupt saudebaaji ke madhyam se use sweekaar karne ke liye manaaya gaya he
 In April 1988, it was revealed that the Government of India had agreed to pay huge sums of money to the LTTE in support of the agreement

 Timing had a lot to do with the LTTE taking a new peace initiative in which RAW was playing a leading role

 Ultimately, only one installment was paid, but this situation came because within three months of the settlement, the Indian Peace Keeping Force had to face war with the LTTE in Jaffna
 1987 aate-aate rajeev gandhi sarkaar kii hawa nikal chuki thi
 Rajiv Gandhi was a hasty type of person
 apane paanch saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan unki uplabdhiyaan ullekhneey rahi hai
 He managed to change the mindset of many Indians and prepared the country for the twenty-first century
 samay-samay par utaavlepan kaa parichay dene vaale rajeev kaa maananaa tha ki jatil samasyaon ko shabdadambar ke sahare hal kiya ja saktaa he
 This had unexpected results
 1984 se 1989 ke bich unhone (rajeev ne) apane mantrimandal main do darjan se zyada pherbadal kiye
 The only minister to have completed five years in his cabinet was Railway Minister Madhavrao Scindia
 unke pradhanmantri rahete videsh mantralay ne chaar cabinet mantri tathaa chah rajyamantriyon kaa munh dekha
 In a nutshell, the ministers were not able to understand their work properly or to submit any long-term policy proposals
 apane pradhanmantri pad ke pehle atharah maheenon ke dauraan rajeev gandhi lagbhag puri tarah ati ahamkaari moorkhon kii ek team par nirbhar ho gaye the
 He was sharp but insolent

 The third was an inexplicable headache

 He damaged Rajiv Gandhi's reputation and his image

 Look at the irony that they had to pay the price for jumping into the ethnic conflict of Sri Lanka
 'arun singh to dost hai'bhartiya sena ne thal senadhyaksh general krishnaswami sundarji kii kaman main bharat-paak seemaa par ‘brastax’ code naam ke vyapak sainya abhyaas kii yojana banaai thi

 There were reports in Indian newspapers that Pakistan is mobilizing its forces for war
 maine videsh rajyamantri kii haisiyat se rajeev gandhi ko bataaya ki videsh mantralay ko is bare main kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 The Prime Minister said that he too does not know anything about it
 main dang rah gaya
 It is evident that Arun Singh and General Krishnaswamy Sundarji were carrying out this campaign without their approval
 maine unase kaha ki unhen fouran mantri ko barkhaast kar dena chahie
 But his response was, "arun Singh is a friend
 ”maine tanik kadai se kaha, “sar, aap doon skool ke old boij association ke adhyaksh nahin hai

 " elactoral bond ke jariye chanda ugaahi or raajnneetik dalon kii funding kii paardarshita ko lekar buudhvaar ko supreme court main sunwaayee hui
 Opposing the central government's stance, the Election Commission (EC) has told the Supreme Court that the scheme of electoral bonds will affect transparency in political funding
 sunwaayee ke dauraan chunaav ayog ne supreme court ko jaankaree di ki usne centre ko patr likhakar kaha he ki raajnneetik chande se jude kai kanoonon main badlaav ke paardarshita par gambhir parinaam honge
 Ayeag said that changes in the FCRA 2010 law would allow political parties to receive unauthorized foreign funds, which could affect Indian policies from foreign companies
 supreme court main halafanama daayar karne vaale chunaav ayog ne kaha ki 26 may 2017 ko usne vidhi evam nyaay mantralay ko patr likhakar apane is nazariye se avgat karaayaa tha ki iskar kanoon, janpratinidhitiv kanoon or vitt kanoon main badlaav raajnneetik dalon ko chande main paardarshita ke khilaaf honge
 The affidavit states that the Ministry of Law and Justice has been informed that in such a situation money received through electoral bonds cannot be reported
 aise main yah jaankaree praapt karnaa mushkil hoga ki kya riprogentation of pipal act kii dhara 29bi ke tahat kanoon ulanghan hua he yaa nahin
 Under this section, government companies or political parties cannot receive money from foreign sources

 The government introduced this bond with the claim that it would increase transparency in political funding and bring in clean money

 Instead of bringing transparency, this bond has increased the risk, not only that there is scope for donations from foreign sources also
 jab bollywood actor harman baweja industry main aae the us dauraan unhone kuch samay main hi acchhee fain folowing bana lee thi
 Harman was then compared to actors like Hrithik Roshan
 saath hi priyanka chopra sang unke afaire kii bhi khabaren thim
 But Harman got frustrated on both the front
 jahaan ek taraf unki filmon ne box offis par acha pradarshan nahin kiya vahiin duusari taraf priyanka sang unka relation bhi bahut lambey vakt tak aage nahin bad paaya
 Harman was born on 13 November 1980 in Chandigarh
 harman ne ek intervyuu main yah bataaya tha ki unka or priyanka kaa rishta kyon nahin chal sakaa
 Harman and Priyanka's friendship started in 2008 with the film 'love Story 2050'
 us samay harman bhi industry main nae-nae the
 The friendship of the two turned into love, but their relationship broke even before the release of their next film, What's Your Rashi
 donon kaa rishta do saal se bhi kam samay tak chalaa
 Harman had told in an interview why he and Priyanka separated
 harman ne bataaya ki unke paas priyanka ke liye samay nahin tha
 Two of his films had already flopped, so the pressure on them increased
 ve apni teesri film par focus kar rahe the
 'whats your amount' was very important to me
 nirdeshak ashutosh goarikar ne unhen apane personal spes main kisi ko jagah na dene kii hidaayat di thi
 Harman said that Priyanka used to keep asking her to give her time
 lekin ve aisa nahin kar sake
 Due to this, the relationship of both of them soured and separated
 kya priyanka ne harman sang todaa tha naata-kuch reports main yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki priyanka ne hi harman se rishta todaa tha, kyonki ve khud ko ek safal actor ke taur par sthapit nahin kar sake the
 Harman dismissed these reports and said, "I do not believe in these rumors
" pyaar main keval do hi insaan jaan sakate hai ki unke bich kya galat rahaa
 i do not think that any success or failure changes the relationship
 '' Law Minister Salman Khurshid returned from a foreign trip on Sunday amid protests by Arvind Kejriwal and said he would counter allegations with strong evidence that his NGO had misappropriated funds meant for the welfare of disabled people
 kanoonmantri kaa subah aijiai hawaii adde par virodh hua, jahaan india against karpshan ke kaaryakartaaon ne unke khilaaf narebaaji kii or kaale jhande dikhaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Khurshid, who has been traveling to London for the past few days, dismissed the allegations leveled by a TV channel and Kejriwal's organization IAAC
 aarope hai ki khurshid or unki patni louis ke swaamitv vaala dow jakir hossain memorial trust vittiya dhaandhlee or jaalsaji main sanlipt he
 The comments kanoonmantri ne yahaan pahunchane par samvaadadaataaon se kaha, main pukhta sabooton ke saath aaropon kaa muqabla karuunga

 Louise, the project director of NGO Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Trust and wife of Khurshid, had on Saturday targeted Kejriwal, saying the allegations were baseless

 The passion to predict this accurately is more dangerous than the contestants
 koun jitegaa yah bataa dena andaazitakkar waalon kii duniya main aapako hero bana saktaa he
 During the election, we get a lot of phone calls
 bataao koun jitegaa? kya lag rahaa he? koun kah rahaa he? yah na ho to chunaav kaa mazaa chalaa jaataa he
 Many times i isolate myself, but many times i am not able to stop myself from getting caught in this web of curiosity
 aap kya chaahate hai, kya hota dikh rahaa he, dekhne vaala koun he or kya hoga in chaar baton kii kasuti par kisi bhi chunavi bhavishyavaanee ko parkhaa janaa chahie
 People are divided into two camps regarding the prediction of Bihar
 ek chahta he ki aap yah kah den ki bijepi haaregi to vah khush ho jaataa he
 The other just wants to hear that the BJP wins
 kai baar in donon khemon ke logon ke chehre par tanaav dekhakar sahanubhuti ho jaati he
 It seems that if you have said that what you want will not happen, then do not leave this food and drink somewhere
 umr or kamazor dil bhaanp kar jhooth bol dene main koi buraai nahin he! There is a third camp, which is more fierce than these fans
 wo sirf yah nahin chahta ki bijepi yaa nitish haare, balki yah bhi chahta he ki mere man kii party ek baar jeet jaae to haarane vaale ke samarthakon par dhauns jamaa sakuun
 i can tease them
 unke saamne dance kar sakuun
 They have nothing to do with the humility of the time of victory
 maan lijiye bijepi jeet gai to yah tabaka un logon ko phone karegaa, hadakaaegaa or lekh likhakar kuntha nikaalega
 This is exactly what Nitish will do if he wins
 kuch log aise bhi hai, jo apane man ke mutabik nattejey kii khabar sunakar dar jate hai
 Don't speak now aath ko hi dekhenge
 i have crossed the finger
 abhi jashn nahin manaayenge
 Last time i did the same, but that party lost
 achaanak wo kisi andhvishwasi-sa bartaav karne lagata he
 There are many people who start spreading rumors that someone will win or lose, thinking that the loser and loser or loser will start winning or the winner will win more
 is khel main patrkaar bhi shaamil hai
 Journalists are doing this on 'ideological payroll' from both sides
 agar aap patrkaar hai or kisi ke haarane jeetne kii bhavishyavaanee kar rahe hai to is najar se dekhe jane kaa khatra to uthaanaa hi hoga
 This is a fact
 media kaa partykaran puraa ho chukaa he
 It is not that it has happened after the coming of the Modi government, but it has already happened
 corporate ne patrakaron ke is partykaran ko or badhaava diya he
 You just do that by declaring one as the opponent and start looking at the other
 jabaki jise dekh rahe hai vah bhi kisi kaa ghor samarthak bataaya jaataa he
 There is also a fashion to declare the media as pro and anti
 kai darshak bhi apni raajnneetik nishtha ke hisaab se khabar dekhnaa chaahate hai
 There is a considerable difference in demand and understanding of equilibrium
 baharhaal koun kiskaa samarthak he yah mahatvapurn nahin he
 The important thing is that everyone is bare in this hammam
 apane ko changa or duusare ko nanga kah rahe hai
 Those who are not anywhere, who are seeing what they are saying are also coming to their peace
 bihar main koun jitegaa kya is daavedaari kii khabar se haarane vaala jeet jaataa hoga yaa jeetne vaala haar jaataa hoga? is par shodh hona chahie
 There are claims of winning before the election begins and until the eve of the result
 matadaataaon main aisa pratishat to he hi jo yah sunakar vot karata he ki koun jeet rahaa he
 He does not want to spoil his vote
 yah bhi matadaataaon ke bich ek kism kaa baklol or chaalaak category he, jo vijayi paksh ke saath hone kii dhoortta se zyaada kuch nahin
 But there is something that political parties also put a lot of emphasis on propagating that we will win
 tippaniyan Who will win in Bihar is a risky job
 bataane kaa pukhta paimaana kisi ke paas nahin he
 There is no less pressure on the predictor
 wo sahi sabit hona chahta he
 Being wrong can spoil his credibility
 dinabhar alag- alag tarah ke logon ko phone karata rahata hum
 i call all of them to give feedback to different types of people
 phir duusare patrkaar ko phone karata hum
 i mix my prophecy with his prophecy
 kai baar pataa chalata he ki donon ek sorce se baat kar bhavishyavaanee par apana trade mark lagaakar market main thel rahe hai! jis sorce se poocha he wo bhi thik yahi kar rahaa hota he
 Therefore, it is not so easy to tell about victory and defeat
 soch-samaj kar kijiyegaa varanaa nateeja aane par aapke hi dost khoj-khoj kar taane denge ki tum to bol rahe the ki mahagathbandhan jitegaa, tum to bol rahe the ki endie jitegaa
 But if you did not take the risk then what life did you live aap hi bataaiye donon main se koun jitegaa ! What you want, what is happening, who is going to see and what will happen, any election prediction should be tested on the basis of these four things
 bihar kii bhavishyavaanee ko lekar log do khemon main bant gaye hai
 One wants you to say that if the BJP loses, it becomes happy
 doosraa sirf yah sunanaa chahta he ki bijepi jite
 Many times the people of these two camps become sympathetic after seeing the tension on their faces
 lagata he ki agar kah diya ki aap jo chaahate hai wo nahin hoga to kahin ye khaanaa-pinaa na chhod den
 There is no harm in telling lies through age and weak heart! ek teesraa khemaa hota he, jo in chaahane waalon se zyada ugr hota he
 He not only wants the BJP or Nitish to lose, but also wants that once the party of my mind wins, i can bully the supporters of the loser
 unhen chidhaa sakuun
 i can dance in front of them
 inkaa jeet ke vakt kii vinamrata se koi lenaa-dena nahin hota
 Suppose the BJP wins, then this section will call those people, strike them and write the article and remove the frustration
 thik isi tarah se nitish ke jeetne par karegaa
 There are some people who are scared to hear the news of the result according to their mind
 abhi mat bolo
 Only eight will be seen
 maine to finger cross kar liya he
 We will not celebrate now
 pichhali baar aisa hi kiya tha, lekin wo party to haar gai
 Suddenly he starts behaving like a superstitious
 bahut log aise bhi hote hai, jo yah sochakar kisi ke haarane jeetne kii afvaah failaane lagate ki isse haarane vaala or haaregaa yaa haarane vaala jeetne lagegaa yaa jeetne vaala or jitegaa
 Journalists are also involved in this game
 donon taraf se 'vaicharik perol' par patrkaar aisa kar rahe hai
 If you are a journalist and are predicting someone to win, then you have to take the risk of being seen from this point of view
 yah ek sachai he
 Media sharing has been completed
 aisa nahin ki modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad hi hua he, balki pehle se hi hota aayaa he
 The corporate has further promoted this partnership of journalists
 aap bas yahi karte hai ki ek ko virdohi ghoshit kar duusare ko dekhne lagate hai
 While the one who is watching is also said to be a great supporter of someone
 media ko samarthak or virdohi ghoshit karne kaa ek fishan-sa bhi chal padaa he
 Many viewers also want to watch the news according to their political allegiance
 santulan kii maang or samaj main kaaphi antar dikhataa he
 However, who is whose supporter is not important
 mahatvapurn yah he ki sab is hamaam main nange hai
 Healing himself and calling others naked
 jo log kahin nahin hai, jo dekh rahe hai vahi bol rahe hai unki bhi shamat aane vaali he
 Who will win in Bihar, will the loser win or will the winner lose the news of this claim? There should be research on this
 chunaav shuru hone se pehle jeetne ke daawey hote hai or nattejey kii purv sandhya tak hote rahete hai
 There is such a percentage in the voters who vote after hearing who is winning
 wo apana vot karaab nahin karnaa chahta
 It is also a kind of cunning and clever category among the voters, which is nothing more than the cunning of being with the victorious side
 par kuch to he ki raajnneetik dal bhi ham jeetenge ke prachaar prasar par kaaphi jor dete hai 
 The comments bihar main koun jitegaa yah ek jokhim kaa kaam he
 No one has a strong scale to tell
 bhavishyavaanee karne vaale par bhi kam dabaav nahin he
 He wants to be proved right
 galat hone se uski saakh kharaab ho sakati he
 i keep calling different types of people throughout the day
 un sabhi se alag-alag tarah ke logon ko phone kar feedback dene ke liye kahata hum
 Then call another journalist
 uski bhavishyavaanee se apni bhavishyavaanee milaataa hum
 Many a times it is learned that both are talking to a source and putting their trade mark on the prediction and putting them in the market! The source you asked is doing the same thing
 isliye haar jeet ke bare main bataa dena itnaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 Think carefully, otherwise your friends will taunt you in search of the result that you were saying that the Grand Alliance will win, you were saying that the NDA will win
 lekin jokhim hi nahin liya to jivan kya jiyaa
 You tell me which one of the two will win! ek teesraa khemaa hota he, jo in chaahane waalon se zyada ugr hota he
 He not only wants the BJP or Nitish to lose, but also wants that once the party of my mind wins, i can bully the supporters of the loser
 unhen chidhaa sakuun
 i can dance in front of them
 inkaa jeet ke vakt kii vinamrata se koi lenaa-dena nahin hota
 Suppose the BJP wins, then this section will call those people, strike them and write the article and remove the frustration
 thik isi tarah se nitish ke jeetne par karegaa

 bahut log aise bhi hote hai, jo yah sochakar kisi ke haarane jeetne kii afvaah failaane lagate ki isse haarane vaala or haaregaa yaa haarane vaala jeetne lagegaa yaa jeetne vaala or jitegaa
 Journalists are also involved in this game
 donon taraf se 'vaicharik perol' par patrkaar aisa kar rahe hai
 If you are a journalist and are predicting someone to win, then you have to take the risk of being seen from this point of view
 yah ek sachai he
 Media sharing has been completed
 aisa nahin ki modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad hi hua he, balki pehle se hi hota aayaa he
 The corporate has further promoted this partnership of journalists
 aap bas yahi karte hai ki ek ko virdohi ghoshit kar duusare ko dekhne lagate hai
 While the one who is watching is also said to be a great supporter of someone
 media ko samarthak or virdohi ghoshit karne kaa ek fishan-sa bhi chal padaa he
 Many viewers also want to watch the news according to their political allegiance
 santulan kii maang or samaj main kaaphi antar dikhataa he
 However, who is whose supporter is not important
 mahatvapurn yah he ki sab is hamaam main nange hai
 Healing himself and calling others naked
 jo log kahin nahin hai, jo dekh rahe hai vahi bol rahe hai unki bhi shamat aane vaali he
 Who will win in Bihar, will the loser win or will the winner lose the news of this claim? There should be research on this
 chunaav shuru hone se pehle jeetne ke daawey hote hai or nattejey kii purv sandhya tak hote rahete hai
 There is such a percentage in the voters who vote after hearing who is winning
 wo apana vot karaab nahin karnaa chahta
 It is also a kind of cunning and clever category among the voters, which is nothing more than the cunning of being with the victorious side
 par kuch to he ki raajnneetik dal bhi ham jeetenge ke prachaar prasar par kaaphi jor dete hai 
 The comments bihar main koun jitegaa yah ek jokhim kaa kaam he
 No one has a strong scale to tell
 bhavishyavaanee karne vaale par bhi kam dabaav nahin he
 He wants to be proved right
 galat hone se uski saakh kharaab ho sakati he
 i keep calling different types of people throughout the day
 un sabhi se alag-alag tarah ke logon ko phone kar feedback dene ke liye kahata hum
 Then call another journalist
 uski bhavishyavaanee se apni bhavishyavaanee milaataa hum
 Many a times it is learned that both are talking to a source and putting their trade mark on the prediction and putting them in the market! The source you asked is doing the same thing
 isliye haar jeet ke bare main bataa dena itnaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 Think carefully, otherwise your friends will taunt you in search of the result that you were saying that the Grand Alliance will win, you were saying that the NDA will win
 lekin jokhim hi nahin liya to jivan kya jiyaa
 You tell me which one of the two will win! kuch log aise bhi hai, jo apane man ke mutabik nattejey kii khabar sunakar dar jate hai
 Don't speak now aath ko hi dekhenge
 i have crossed the finger
 abhi jashn nahin manaayenge
 Last time i did the same, but that party lost
 achaanak wo kisi andhvishwasi-sa bartaav karne lagata he
 There are many people who start spreading rumors that someone will win or lose, thinking that the loser and loser or loser will start winning or the winner will win more
 is khel main patrkaar bhi shaamil hai
 Journalists are doing this on 'ideological payroll' from both sides
 agar aap patrkaar hai or kisi ke haarane jeetne kii bhavishyavaanee kar rahe hai to is najar se dekhe jane kaa khatra to uthaanaa hi hoga
 This is a fact
 media kaa partykaran puraa ho chukaa he
 It is not that it has happened after the coming of the Modi government, but it has already happened
 corporate ne patrakaron ke is partykaran ko or badhaava diya he
 You just do that by declaring one as the opponent and start looking at the other
 jabaki jise dekh rahe hai vah bhi kisi kaa ghor samarthak bataaya jaataa he
 There is also a fashion to declare the media as pro and anti
 kai darshak bhi apni raajnneetik nishtha ke hisaab se khabar dekhnaa chaahate hai
 There is a considerable difference in demand and understanding of equilibrium
 baharhaal koun kiskaa samarthak he yah mahatvapurn nahin he
 The important thing is that everyone is bare in this hammam
 apane ko changa or duusare ko nanga kah rahe hai
 Those who are not anywhere, who are seeing what they are saying are also coming to their peace
 bihar main koun jitegaa kya is daavedaari kii khabar se haarane vaala jeet jaataa hoga yaa jeetne vaala haar jaataa hoga? is par shodh hona chahie
 There are claims of winning before the election begins and until the eve of the result
 matadaataaon main aisa pratishat to he hi jo yah sunakar vot karata he ki koun jeet rahaa he
 He does not want to spoil his vote
 yah bhi matadaataaon ke bich ek kism kaa baklol or chaalaak category he, jo vijayi paksh ke saath hone kii dhoortta se zyaada kuch nahin
 But there is something that political parties also put a lot of emphasis on propagating that we will win
 tippaniyan Who will win in Bihar is a risky job
 bataane kaa pukhta paimaana kisi ke paas nahin he
 There is no less pressure on the predictor
 wo sahi sabit hona chahta he
 Being wrong can spoil his credibility
 dinabhar alag- alag tarah ke logon ko phone karata rahata hum
 i call all of them to give feedback to different types of people
 phir duusare patrkaar ko phone karata hum
 i mix my prophecy with his prophecy
 kai baar pataa chalata he ki donon ek sorce se baat kar bhavishyavaanee par apana trade mark lagaakar market main thel rahe hai! jis sorce se poocha he wo bhi thik yahi kar rahaa hota he
 Therefore, it is not so easy to tell about victory and defeat
 soch-samaj kar kijiyegaa varanaa nateeja aane par aapke hi dost khoj-khoj kar taane denge ki tum to bol rahe the ki mahagathbandhan jitegaa, tum to bol rahe the ki endie jitegaa
 But if you did not take the risk then what life did you live aap hi bataaiye donon main se koun jitegaa ! Media sharing has been completed

 makar sankranti ke maukey par shanivaar ko rashtriya janata dal supremeo lalu prasad ke yahaan chuda dahi ke bhoj kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 In which the BJP leaders were also invited for the first time on behalf of Lalu
 haalanki bijepi ne is nyote ko thukraa diya or party kaa koi bhi netaa lalu ke is bhoj main shaamil nahin hua
 RJD Councilor Bhola Yadav said that on the instruction of Lalu ji, i telephoned myself to invite BJP leaders like Sushil Modi, Nityanand Rai, Nandkishore Yadav and Jitan Ram Manjhi, the leader of Ham Party
 un logon ne aamantran ko sweekaarte hue bhoj main shaamil hone kii baat kahi thi
 In such a situation, the question arises that why did Laloo Prasad invite BJP leaders to the banquet of Dahi Chuda on the occasion of Makar Sankranti
 Actually, the reason is that Chuda curd banquet was also organized by Janata Dal United on January 15 and BJP leaders were also invited to it
 sutron ke mutabik janata dal united ke pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne bhaajapa netaaon komukhyamantri nitish kumarase hari jhandi milane ke baad hi aamantrit kiya he
 It is believed that the way in which Jugalbandi was seen between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar during the recent Prakash Parv is the result of the break-up of the BJP-JDU alliance in 2013 by the Janata Dal United After this, BJP leaders have been invited for the first time
 shaayad nitish ke bijepi netaaon ko aamantrit karne ke kaaran lalu nen bhi bhaajapa netaaon ko nyotaa bheja
 On the other hand, according to the BJP leaders, the manner in which Lalu was invited to attend the banquet of curd bangle from here, he passed away

 a post shared by Bollywoodirect (@bollywoodirect) on Jul 31, 2018 at 9:52 pm PDT gandhi parivaar ke siyaasi garh sultanpur main varun gandhi kii mahabharat dikh rahi he
 Riding on the chariot in posters, Varun has challenged Tai Sonia and brother Rahul
 varun ke sarathi historishiter sonu singh bane hai jinhen buudhvaar ko bijepi main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Such hoardings have been installed in the city, in which historyheater Sonu Singh is chanting Krishna as Krishna, and Arjun is fighting Varun
 darasal, varun gandhi ne gandhi parivaar ke siyaasi garh sultanpur main raily kar rahul or sonia ko lalakaara he
 bjp's Gandhi Varun will contest from here
 raily main lage hordings ko dekhakar laga ki is yug ko kaliyug kyon kehete hai? hordings main dekh sakate hai ki historishiter sonu singh bhagwaan krishna bane rath haank rahe hai or varun gandhi arjuna bane yuddh kar rahe hai
 Can they be compared to Krishna and Arjuna? But there is a similarity between that and this Mahabharata that they too fought with their own, they have come to fight with their own
 haa, yah fark jarur he ki arjuna ke saath koi historishiter nahin tha
 On this occasion, Sonu Singh said that in the coming parliamentary elections, i will fully support the venerable Varun Bhaiya with all my heart and with full devotion and will try to win both my assemblies Sultanpur and Isoli by a huge vote
 sultanpur shuru se gandhi parivaar kaa garh rahaa he
 So far, Congress has won this seat eight times

 If he defeats the Congress in this battle, it will also be a defeat for Rahul and Sonia, as Rahul comes from Amethi and Sultania in Rae Bareli district of Sultanpur
 shahar main aise hordings laga die gaye hai, jinamein historishiter sonu singh krishna banakar rath haank rahe hai or arjuna bane varun yuddh kar rahe hai
 In fact, Varun Gandhi has rallied Rahul and Sonia by rallying in Sultanpur, the political stronghold of the Gandhi family
 bijepi ke gandhi varun yahaan se chunaav ladenge
 Seeing the hoardings in the rally, why did you call this era Kali Yuga? In the hoardings, you can see that the history sheeter Sonu Singh is chanting the chariot made by Lord Krishna and Varun Gandhi is fighting the war as Arjun
 kya inaki tulana krishna or arjuna se ho sakati he? lekin us or is mahabharat main ek samanta he ki ve bhi apano se lard gaye, ye apano se ladane aae hai
 Yes, the difference is that there was no historyheater with Arjun
 sonu singh ne is maukey par kaha ki aane vaale sansadeey chunaavon main main tan-man-dhan se or puri nishtha se aadarneey varun bhaiya kaa puure se puraa sahyog karuunga or apni donon vidhansabhaon sultanpur or isoli se baari maton se vijayi banane kaa prayaas karuunga
 Sultanpur has been the stronghold of the Gandhi family from the beginning
 ab tak aath baar congress ne yah seat jiti he
 On this occasion, Varun Gandhi said, My father's hand has been in your hand
 aane vaale samay main aapkaa ksht apana ksht samajhakar kaam karne kii koshish karuunga
 The comments sonu singh sultanpuri kii isoli seat se chunaav lade rahe hai
 His history sheet is open in the police station here, according to which his brother Monu Singh Ganglider and he himself are members of the gang

 ek prasiddh roosi kitaab he-manushya mahabali kaise bana
 It is the first chapter of this book, which describes the scientific and intellectual achievements of human beings - "nature's cage"
 ” kitaab bataati he ki manushya balavaan he kyonki usne prakruti ke rahasyon ko khoj liya he
 But no more than nature
 sabase zyada unmukt or aaazaad dikhne vaale pakshi bhi darasal prakruti ke us adrishy pinjre ke gulam hai
 They are seen measuring the sky from this end to that end, but still do not go beyond their geographical and natural boundaries
 is kitaab or is kahani kaa zikr yahaan kyon jaruri tha? darasal, uttarakhand van vibhaag ne jarnal of bird life international ke naam se vahaan ke prakritik awaas main vicharan karne vaale pakshiyon kii jo suchi jari kii he, vah bahut saare maujuun sawaal khadey karne vaali he
 This list shows that 28 species of birds have gone extinct from Uttarakhand
 uttarakhand ke pahaad, nadiyaan or thanda mausam kabhi inkaa ashiana hua karata tha
 But now they have left him and gone to which unknown world
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 When 28 species became extinct, 98 came from where they were wandering
 uttarakhand van vibhaag ne sabase pehle 2003 main pakshiyon kii pehali checklist jari kii thi
 a total of 623 species of birds were mentioned in this list
 ab 11 saal baad van vibhaag ne duusari baar rajya main pai jane vaali chidipoon kii checklist jari kii to nattejey hairaan karne vaale hai
 Although the total number of species of birds has increased to 693, 28 species previously found have gone out of this list
 pakshi insaanon kii tarah behatar jindagi kii talash main apane basere nahin badla karte
 They do not leave their home until there is a crisis on existence
 isliye vanyajeev premiyon kii chintaa kaa sawaal yah he ki ye pakshi yahaan ke badalte paristhitikeey tantra ke saath talmail nahin baitha sake, isliye apana baseraa chhod kahin or ud gaye
 The same list released in 2003 predicted the extinction of the Mountain Quail (also known as Himalayan Quail) found in Jharipani and Nainital in Mussoorie
 is suchi main bhi mountain quail kaa naam nahin he
 In addition to the 28 species that have disappeared, the existence of Bayers Pochard, three species of vulture slender build culture, white culture and red-headed culture have also been threatened
 iske alaava vilupt ho gai prajatiyon main rain quail, king quail, lesar lorican, indian courser, little gal, little turn, tibatan sandakrj, european turtal dav, board kuku dav, thik bild, green pijan, indian swiftlet, silver brested brible, grey chinnad minivet, european skylark, slate villide tesia, redies barbler, yalo browder barbler, thik bild barbler aadi hai
 In February, in order to promote eco-tourism through this fascinating world of birds, the Uttarakhand government also organized the Spring Bird Festival at Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve adjoining Corbett National Park
 yah rajya kaa doosraa bird festival tha
 Earlier, a bird festival was held at Asan Barrage near Dehradun
 ek ore to rajya sarkaar apane eco paryaton ko badhaava dene ke liye pakshiyon kii ye prajatiyaan duniya ko dikhaane kii yojana bana rahi he or duusari ore pakshi vilupt hote ja rahe hai
 This list is also a big setback for the state government
 uttarakhand se laapata ho rahe pakshiyon ke prati chintaa vyakt karte hue rajya ke van mantri dinesh agarwal kehete hai, “rajya sarkaar vanyajeevon ke prati logon ko jaagruk kar rahi he
 Our effort is to connect wildlife with the employment of people, so that they can be more serious about their conservation
 ”pavalgadh conjarveshan rigerv kii khaasiyat yah he ki yahaan ek chote ilaake main 352 prajati ke pakshiyon kaa colorav ek saath sunai detaa he
 However, the arrival of more than 70 new species of birds is also a matter of happiness
 rajya ke pramukh vanyajeev pratipaalak digvijay singh khaati kehete hai, “sambhawatah badalte hue paristhitikeey tantra ke kaaran hi pakshiyon kii kai prajatiyaan vilupt ho gai hai or isi kaaran nai prajatiyaan is ore aakarshith bhi hui hai
 “the changing ecological system of the state has not only affected the birds
 jaleey jeev-jantuon ke astitv par bhi sankat mandara rahaa he
 Many species of fish are going extinct due to the formation of dams and drying up of rivers
 hemavathi nandan bahuguna kendriya vishvavidhyalay ke vaigyanik pro

 Bahuguna says, "the dam built in Srinagar has brought Alaknanda to dry conditions in many places
 is kaaran yahaan milane vaali machhliyon kaa vajood bhi sankat main pad gaya he
 “man is playing with nature in the name of development, cutting forests, building dams
 kahin nadiyaan dubo rahi hai to kahin suukh rahi hai
 Somewhere the mountains are bursting, and elsewhere the earth is assuming a form of rage
 mausam ke badalane kaa alam to yah he ki insaan hairaan-pareshaan he
 What to say about birds and animals? sab baat khatm ho jane ke baad bhi sawaal jas kaa jas he
 Man is definitely strong, but not more than nature
 usase zyada balavaan hone kii koshish hi is uthal-puthal ke rup main saamne ai he

 He said that for the last five years, all the data and data of his wrong administration fulfills the government's objective of removing it

 From this website you can find out how many trains are running on time and how late
 hamane shaam chah baje dekha to pataa chal rahaa tha ki 68 pratishat railgadiyaan deree se chal rahi hai
 This delay can be anything
 ek minute kii bhi or 20 ghante kii bhi
 Red marks are telling that Indian Railways have a lot to do in terms of time
 jo bhi kuch karne kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he is data se to nahin lagata ki koi thos nateeja niklaa he
 Only 35 percent of the vehicles are running on time
 hamane jab bhi is website ko dekha, isi ke aas paas trainen let rahi hai
 But according to the figures given by the railways on time on Saturday, only 30 percent of the trains in 2017-18 have been delayed
 ab in do aankadon main antar he
 According to the railroad, whenever we saw 60 to 70 percent of the vehicles were lying down
 rail mantralay ke hisaab se 30 pratishat gaadiyaan hi deree se chali hai
 But their average is around the year
 shanivaar ko pitiai kii khabar thi ki railway board ke chairman ashvini lohani ne samay ko lekar ek baithak kii he
 Railways believe that work is on to improve safety standards, so there will be a problem of delay
 baithak ke dauraan samiksha main paaya gaya ki kanpur, tundla, agra or mughalsarai se guzarane vaali gaadiyaan samay se nahin chal paa rahi hai
 The railways say the average delay in the North Setrell zone in April is 40 percent
 aap jaanate hai ki hamane swatantraaa senaanee express kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya, ab yah train thik thaak samay se chal rahi he

 simanchal express itrain info ke hisaab se saal main 12 ghante kii ausat deree se chali he
 Often this train runs for 10 hours, 20 hours and sometimes 50 hours late
 hamane is train kaa masalaa khub uthaaya
 Between May 1 and May 7, the train ran for a minimum delay of 5 hours and a maximum delay of 38 hours
 lekin hamane iskaa masalaa uthaaya to isaki timming main kuch khaas sudhaar nahin hua he
 The National Train Inquiry system has only one week of data
 - simanchal express 9 may ko anand vihaar terminal pahunchi he 11 ghanta 25 minute kii deree se - reached Anand Vihar on May 10 with a delay of 8 hours 17 minutes - 11 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 12 ghante kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 12 with a delay of 6 hours 15 minutes - 13 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 20 minute kii deree se But Seemanchal is open on time every day from May 11 to Anand Jogbani since May 11

 Passengers delayed by delaying Ajay Singh at Varanasi station began to convey their problems in the hope that perhaps the Railway Minister would get attention and they would get rid of the delay

 He told that those who were not contacted could not put their number in the hospital
 unka aana bekaar ho gaya
 If the same problem happens at the airport someday, then on that day the channels will also leave the statements of the leaders and reach the airport

 Do we know our rights, use them, have we got so many rights, why don't we talk about rights? yah mudda kyon nahin he, kyon yatri 30 se 70 ghante kii yatnaa bhi sehate hai or badale main unhen kuch miltaa bhi nahin he

 jab habib kaa camera kareeb se dekhtaa he to pani kii boonden tapak rahi hoti hai
 This man could barely fill the water, he strangled him
 aam logon ke liye pani bhi kitni mushkil se tapakataa he
 When you wait for the train for 30 hours at the station, how much will be spent on the water itself
 khaane par kitna kharch hota hoga
 All these should be accounted for
 sirf chinia baadaam kaa kharchaa nahin joda jayega
 a wedding machine is installed at the station from which people are buying water
 pani kaa rate aap dekh lijie
 300 ml 1 rupees, if taken with the bottle, you will have to pay 2 rupees
 500 emal pani ke liye 3 rupaya, bottle ke saath 5 rupaya
 You have to pay 8 rupees for 2 liters and 12 rupees if you take the bottle
 ye iarsitisi kaa water vending mashin he
 Now think what will be your condition if you are traveling by amritsar-darumbhaga Jannayak Express
 steshnon se muft pani kaa system khatm hota ja rahaa he yaa kam hota ja rahaa he, itani bheed hoti he ki bharte bharte train chalane lagati he
 On the website of national train inquiry system, you enter the number of 15215 Jannayak Express
 isamen ausat deree kaa bhi ek kollam he
 If you click on it, it will be known that the average delay of reaching Amritsar Darbhanga Jannayak Express Darbhanga station is 21 hours 38 minutes
 yah ausat 2 november 2017 se he
 Tell that for the last six months this train is reaching Darbhanga with a delay of 21 hours 38 minutes
 hamane apni rail series main is train par kaaphi jor diya he magar koi sudhaar nahin he
 The average time for this train to reach Darbhanga from May 1 to May 7 is 20 hours 37 minutes
 ye nunatam deree bataa rahe hai
 The maximum delay time is 58 hours 58 minutes
 ye vaali jaankaree etrain
 is extracted from the website of info
 4 may ko koun si train 58 ghante 58 minute kii deree se pahunchi he, aap is tarah ke sawaal rail mantri se unke twitor handle par na karen
 The example of Jananayak Express is given because there is not a single AC coach in this train
 sabhi general hai
 It is obvious that when a train is late for 20 hours to 58 hours, the workers will also feel thirsty
 kya railway ko rajdhani or duranton kii tarah inhen pani kii bottle or khaanaa nahin dena chahie
 Now we tell the condition of a train
 ek yatri ne train ke bare main soochna di or mobile se video record kar bheja he
 This train runs between Gorakhpur to Siwan
 kushinagar tamakuhi road se hokar guzarati he
 The video sent by the passenger shows the condition of the coach but the crowd is very large
 yah video do teen din pehle kaa he
 Passenger told that the time to open from Gorakhpur is at 5
10 am, but it is delayed by several hours
 isaki seat bahut choti he
 Passengers stand and walk
 prime time ke liye research main madad kar rahe shivank ne itrain info se bataaya ki yah train 166 kimi kii duuri 5 ghante main puraa karti he
 If you find the average of its latency and then calculate the speed, then this train runs at an average speed of 24 km per hour, that is, equivalent to a freight train
 31 may 2017 ko yah train 11 kisi prati ghante kii raftaar se chali he
 It is lying 294 times in a year
 12 baar radd hui he
 The maximum delay is 10 hours and the average delay is 1 hour 42 minutes
 is train main saadhaaran log safar karte hai
 Passengers are also disturbed by the crowd
 prime time ke zarie yatri chaahate hai ki rail mantri ise dekhen or kuch karen
 To reduce congestion, run another train or increase the coach
 tippaniyan Do you know that the loco pilots driving the train are celebrating Black Day on 14 May, 15 May and 16 May
 inke pradarshan kaa naam he mundi garam pradarshan
 These people want the engine to have AC because the condition gets worse in the hot summer
 inaki kuch maangen hamaari samaj se baahar hai kyonki ham loko payalat kii vyavastha ko nahin jaanate hai
 Paramjit Singh, president of the Northern Region of All India Loco Running Staff Association, said that according to the 7th Pay Commission, an allowance of Rs 848 should be given on 100 km while Rs 250
 inkaa daawa he ki loko payalat ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya ek lakh he magar is vakt 85,000 loko payalat hai
 Due to the shortage of 15,000, they have to work more than 10 hours
 gaadi chalaane ke liye thik nahin he
 Night duty of 6-7 days is given
 kai baar hafte kii chuttee bhi nahin milti he
 He has taken out a form
 isamen likhaa he ki adhikari ke mundi kaa taapmaana 19 degree celsius hota he yani ve asi main kaam karte hai or rail ingine ke payalat kii mundi kaa taapmaana 58 degree celsius hota he kyonki ve bina asi ke kaam karte hai
 Whereas in the Rail Budget, provision has been made to install AC in the engine
 dharna pradarshan kaa naam hi vicitra he
 Shave hot pradarshan kaa aisa naam to maine bhi kabhi nahin suna tha
 When we saw it at six in the evening, it was known that 68 percent of trains were running late
 yah deree kuch bhi ho sakati he
 Even for one minute and 20 hours
 laal nishaan bataa rahe hai ki bhartiya railway ko samay ke maamle main abhi bahut kuch karnaa he
 Whatever is being claimed to be done, this data does not seem to have produced any concrete result
 sirf 35 pratishat gaadiyaan samay se chal rahi hai
 Whenever we saw this website, trains are lying around it
 magar shanivaar ko railway ne samay par chalane kaa jo aankada diya he uske anusaar 2017-18 main kareeb 30 pratishat gaadiyaan hi deree se chali hai
 Now there is a difference between these two figures
 rilradar ke hisaab se hamane jab bhi dekha 60 se 70 fisadi gaadiyaan let rahi hai
 According to the Railway Ministry, only 30 percent of the trains have run late
 magar unka ausat saal bhar kaa he
 On Saturday, PTI reported that Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the Railway Board, has held a meeting regarding the time
 railway kaa maananaa he ki suraksha maanakon main sudhaar ke kaam ho rahe hai isliye deree kii samasya rahegi
 During the review, it was found that the trains passing through Kanpur, Tundla, Agra and Mughalsarai were not running in time
 railway kaa kahana he ki april main north setrail zone main deree se chalane kaa ausat 40 pratishat he
 You know that we have raised the issue of Freedom Fighter Express many times, now this train is running for a good time
 20 ghante 30 ghante kii deree se chal rahi thi wo ab nahin ho rahaa he
 GM of East Central Railway Lalit Chander Trivedi says that 12 such trains will now be monitored
 unke liye alag se rek kii vyavastha kar yani nai railgadee banaakar samay se chalaane kaa prayaas hoga
 Many passengers do not even know what your rights are due to train delays
 kam hi log hai jo sidhaa rail mantri yaa rail mantralay ke twitor handle par twit kar pate hai
 Seemanchal Express has run an average of 12 hours late in the year according to the Eatrain Info
 praaia yah train 10 ghante, 20 ghante or kabhi kabhi to 50 ghante kii deree se chalati hi he
 We raised the issue of this train a lot
 1 may se 7 may ke bich yah train nunatam 5 ghante kii deree se chali he or adhiktam 38 ghante kii deree se
 But if we raise the issue, then there is no significant improvement in its timing
 neshnal train inquairi system main ek hafte kaa hi data hota he
 - Seemanchal Express reached Anand Vihar Terminal on May 9 with a delay of 11 hours 25 minutes - 10 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 8 ghanta 17 minute kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 11 with a delay of 12 hours - 12 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 15 minute kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 13 with a delay of 6 hours 20 minutes lekin simanchal 11 may ke baad se anand vihaar se jogbani ke liye har din samay par khuli he
 This is a big change
 khulti samay par he, ham khush hote hai, magar raste main let ho jaati he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh went to Varanasi station
 stesan to kaaphi saaf suthra ho gaya he
 One should not panic by seeing the crowds at the station, because the train runs on time or not, the crowd is an integral part of the Indian Railways
 ajay singh dopaher baad chaar baje ke kareeb varanasi stesan par the
 There he noticed that most of the long distance trains were running late
 14004 anand vihaar-patna express 8 ghante let, 13238 patna-mathura 8 ghante let, 12370 kumbh express 10 ghante let chal rahi he
 When we put Varanasi station in the National Train Inquiry System, it showed that within eight hours 26 trains were seen running late there
 gorakhpur shalimaar express nunatam 10 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi or haridwar haavda superfast express 12 ghante 14 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi
 Ajay was at the station when 19306 going from Guwahati to Indore reached Varanasi with a delay of 10 hours
 ajay singh ko varanasi stesan par deree ke maare yatri apni pareshaani is ummid main bataane lage ki shaayad rail mantri kaa dhyaan jayega or ve deree se mukti dilaayenge
 a family was found who had gone to Chhapra for BHU treatment, they could not get treatment even after reaching the Varanasi due to the delayed running of the train
 unhone bataaya ki jinka sampark nahin tha wo aspataal main apana number nahin laga sake
 Their arrival became useless
 yahi dikkat kisi din airport par ho jaae to us din channel bhi netaaon ke bayaan chhodkar hawaii adde par pahunch jaaenge
 The coverage of the rail is reduced during the fog, but the delay is considered normal on normal days
 koi parvaah bhi nahin karata ki is deree se logon ke jivan par kya asar padataa he

 a news dated 17 November 2017 was discussed worldwide
 japan main sukovo express line ke prabandhakon ne tokyo or sukova ke bich chalane vaali train ke liye maafee maangi kyonki vah 20 second pehle khul gai thi
 In Japan, when the train is late, every passenger is given a certificate
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki japan main salanaa ausat deree kitni he
 0 only
 9 minute
 Tell us that the average speed of all trains in Japan throughout the year is not even one minute
 bharat main to 71 ghante baad bhi pahunch kar na to koi maafee maangata he na is par naaraaz hota he
 What happens in India? kya ham apane adhikaar jaanate hai, uskaa istamaal karte hai, kya itane adhikaar mili bhi hai, aakhir ham adhikaron kii baat kyon nahin karte hai
 Why is this not the issue, why the passengers endure 30 to 70 hours of torture and they do not get anything in return
 ham iske liye gaye http: / / www

 If your train is running late by more than three hours, you can cancel your ticket at the station of the journey
 iske badale main aapako bina katautee ke kiraaya waapas milegaa
 If you go from Delhi to Patna and have to take Howrah train from there, if you miss the Howrah train due to delay then in such a situation the fare from Patna to Howrah will be refunded
 magar iske liye aapako patna pahunch kar teen ghante ke bheetar tikat waapas karnaa hoga
 This is the rule, but the reality is that it is so difficult to get confirmed tickets in the Indian Railways that whoever gets the tickets does not cancel when they are late
 rote gaate tees ghante, pachaas ghante baithkar usee train main jaataa he
 Financial Express of 18 April 2018 received another news
 agar rajdhani or duranton 20 ghante ke safar ke baad do ghante se zyaada let hoti he to yatri ko railway kii taraf se rail nir kaa ek bottle muft milegaa
 There will also be a cup with the bottle
 vaise bhi yatriyon ko ek bottle muft miltaa he
 Whose heart does not come on this kindness
 aam taur par rajdhani express samay se chalane ke liye jaani jaati he magar ab aisa nahin he
 On May 11, Dibrugarh Rajdhani which comes from Dibrugarh to New Delhi was 4 hours 38 minutes late
 etrain
 info is a private site
 is par aap train number daalenge to saal bhar kaa record dekh sakate hai
 Shivank did research on this site and told that Dibrugarh Rajdhani was late for 13 hours on October 9 last year
 iske samay se chalane kaa ausat dekhenge to yah train 2 ghante let hoti he
 Rajdhani Express from Agartala to Anand Vihar was delayed by 11 hours on 26 March
 march main to mausam thik hi hota he
 On 9 May 20501, the capital from Agartala to Anand Vihar arrived 4 hours 35 minutes late
 express train let he, paisanger train let he, local train kaa vahi haal he, rajdhani bhi kuch ko chhod samay par nahin pahunch rahi he
 Passengers in the capital and Duronto are getting a bottle of water for free when they are late, but the passenger, superfast, is delayed by 20-30 hours, why the water is not free for their passengers
 patna stesan par maa apane bachche ko jis nal se pani pilaa rahi he, nal se kitna kam pani aata he
 She goes to another tap where some people are filling up with water
 nal pinjre main band he
 When Habib's camera looks closely, drops of water are dripping
 yah janaab to mushkil se pani bhar paae, usee se galaa tar kar liya
 How hard water is dripping for common people
 jab aap stesan par 30 ghante train kaa intazaar karte hai to pani par hi kitna kharch ho jaataa hoga
 How much will it cost to eat in sab kaa hisaab joda janaa chahie
 Only the cost of Chinia almonds will not be added
 stesan par ek wedding mashin lagi he jisase log pani kharid rahe hai
 See the rate of water
 300 emel 1 rupaya, agar bottle ke saath lenge to 2 rupaya dena hoga
 3 rupees for 500ml water, 5 rupees with bottle
 2 litre ke liye 8 rupee dene honge or agar bottle bhi lenge to 12 rupee
 It is the water vending machine of IRCTC
 ab sochie agar aap amritsar-darambhaga jananaayak express se yatra kar rahe hon to aapaki kya haalat hogi
 The free water system from the stations is getting depleted or decreasing, so crowded that trains start filling up
 national train enquiry system kii website par aap train 15212 jananaayak express kaa number daaliye
 It also has a column of average delay
 use clic karenge to pataa chalegaa ki amritsar darbhanga jananaayak express darbhanga stesan par pahunchane kii ausat deree 21 ghanta 38 minute he
 This average is from 2 November 2017
 bataaiye pichley chah maheene se yah train 21 ghante 38 minute kii deree se darbhanga pahunch rahi he
 We have put a lot of emphasis on this train in our rail series but there is no improvement
 1 may se 7 may ke bich is train ke darbhanga pahunchane kaa ausat he 20 ghante 37 minute
 These are the minimum delays
 adhiktam deree kaa samay he 58 ghante 58 minute
 Information containing these
 info kii website se nikaali he
 On 4 May, which train has arrived late by 58 hours 58 minutes, do not ask such questions to Railway Minister on his Twitter handle
 jananaayak express kaa udhaaharan isliye diya kyonki is train main ek bhi asi coach nahin he
 All are generals
 zaahir he jab koi train 20 ghante se lekar 58 ghante tak let hogi to mazaduron ko pyaas bhi lagati hogi
 Should the railways not give them water bottles and food like the Rajdhanis and the Durants
 ab ham ek train kaa haal bataate hai
 a passenger gave information about the train and recorded the video from mobile
 yah train gorakhpur se sivaan ke bich chalati he
 Kushinagar passes through Tamkuhi Road
 yatri ne jo video bheja he usase coach kii haalat to thik dikhti he magar bheed bahut he
 This video is from 2-3 days ago
 yatri ne bataaya ki gorakhpur se khulne kaa samay he 5 bajkar 10 minute par, magar kai ghante kii deree se khulti he
 Its seat is very small
 yatri khadey hokar hi chalate hai
 Shivank, who is assisting in research for prime time, told Eatrain Info that this train completes a distance of 166 km in 5 hours
 agar iske let hone kaa ausat nikaalen or phir raftaar kaa hisaab karen to yah train ausatan 24 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se chalati he yani kii malgadee ke baraabar
 On 31 May 2017, this train has run at a speed of 11 kph
 ek saal main 294 baar let hui he
 Has been canceled 12 times
 adhiktam deree 10 ghante or ausat deree 1 ghanta 42 minute he
 Ordinary people travel in this train
 yatri bheed se bhi pareshaan hai
 Through prime time, passengers want the railway minister to see it and do something
 bheed kam karne ke liye ek or rail chalaa den yaa phir coach badha den
 The comments kya aap jaanate hai ki rail gaadi chalaane vaale loko payalat 14 may, 15 may or 16 may ko kaala diwas manaa rahe hai
 The name of his performance is Mundi hot performance
 ye log chaahate hai ki ingine main asi kii vyavastha ho kyonki tej garmi main haalat kharaab ho jaati he
 Some of their demands are beyond our comprehension because we do not know the system of loco pilot
 ol india loko running staff sangh ke uttari kshetra ke adhyaksh paramjeet singh ne kaha ki 7wein vetan ayog ke hisaab 100 kimi par 848 rupaya bhatta milanaa chahie jabaki miltaa he 250 rupaya
 They claim that the number of posts sanctioned for loco pilots is one lakh but at present there are 85,000 loco pilots
 15000 kii kami ke kaaran inhen 10 ghante se zyaada kaam karnaa padaa he
 It is not okay to drive
 6-7 dinon kii nit duty di jaati he
 Many times a week holiday is not available
 inhone ek parchaa nikaala he
 It states that the temperature of the officer's mundi is 19 ° C, that is, they work in AC and the temperature of the mule of a pilot of a rail engine is 58 ° c because they work without AC
 jabaki rail bajet main ingine main asi lagane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 The name of the demonstration is peculiar
 mundi garam
 i had never even heard such a performance name
 shanivaar ko pitiai kii khabar thi ki railway board ke chairman ashvini lohani ne samay ko lekar ek baithak kii he
 Railways believe that work is on to improve safety standards, so there will be a problem of delay
 baithak ke dauraan samiksha main paaya gaya ki kanpur, tundla, agra or mughalsarai se guzarane vaali gaadiyaan samay se nahin chal paa rahi hai
 The railways say the average delay in the North Setrell zone in April is 40 percent
 aap jaanate hai ki hamane swatantraaa senaanee express kaa maamla kai baar uthaaya, ab yah train thik thaak samay se chal rahi he
 It was running 20 hours and 30 hours late, it is not happening now
 purv madhya railway ke jiem lalit chander trivedi kaa kahana he ki ab 12 aisi trainon par nigaah rakhi jaaegi
 There will be an attempt to run them on time by arranging a separate rake for them i

 train deree hone par aapke kya adhikaar hai, bahut se yatriyon ko pataa bhi nahin hota
 Few people are able to tweet directly on the railway minister or the railway ministry's Twitter handle
 simanchal express itrain info ke hisaab se saal main 12 ghante kii ausat deree se chali he
 Often this train runs for 10 hours, 20 hours and sometimes 50 hours late
 hamane is train kaa masalaa khub uthaaya
 Between May 1 and May 7, the train ran for a minimum delay of 5 hours and a maximum delay of 38 hours
 lekin hamane iskaa masalaa uthaaya to isaki timming main kuch khaas sudhaar nahin hua he
 The National Train Inquiry system has only one week of data
 - simanchal express 9 may ko anand vihaar terminal pahunchi he 11 ghanta 25 minute kii deree se - reached Anand Vihar on May 10 with a delay of 8 hours 17 minutes - 11 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 12 ghante kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 12 with a delay of 6 hours 15 minutes - 13 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 20 minute kii deree se But Seemanchal is open on time every day from May 11 to Anand Jogbani since May 11
 yah ek bada badlaav he
 It is on opening time, we are happy, but it is late on the way
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh varanasi stesan par gaye
 The station has become very clean
 stesan par bheed dekhakar nahin ghabraana chahie, kyonki train samay se chale yaa na chale, bheed bhartiya railway kaa abhinn hissaa he

 Gorakhpur Shalimar Express was running at least 10 minutes late and Haridwar Howrah Superfast Express was running late by 12 hours 14 minutes
 ajay stesan par hi the jab guwahati se indore jane vaali 19306 10 ghante kii deree se varanasi pahunchi
 Passengers delayed by delaying Ajay Singh at Varanasi station began to convey their problems in the hope that perhaps the Railway Minister would get attention and they would get rid of the delay
 ek parivaar mila jo chhapra se biechayu ilaaj ke liye chalaa tha, wo train ke deree se chalane ke kaaran varanasi pahunch kar bhi ilaaj nahin kara sakaa
 He told that those who were not contacted could not put their number in the hospital
 unka aana bekaar ho gaya
 If the same problem happens at the airport someday, then on that day the channels will also leave the statements of the leaders and reach the airport
 kohre ke samay rail kaa kawarej to ho jaataa he magar aam dinon main deree ko saamaanya maan liya jaataa he
 Nobody cares what effect this delay has on people's lives
 aaj ham aapako bataanaa chaahate hai ki europe main agar train let hoti he to tab yatriyon ko kya kya miltaa he, phir aapako bataaenge ki bharat main aapaki train let ho gai, aapkaa imtahaan chhot gaya to aapako kya muawza miltaa he

 17 november 2017 kii ek khabar duniya bhar main charchit hui thi
 The managers of the Tsukovo Express Line in Japan apologized for the train running between Tokyo and Tsukova as it had opened 20 seconds earlier
 japan main train let hoti he to har yatri ko ek certificate diya jaataa he
 But do you know how much the average annual delay is in Japan
 maatr 0
 9 minutes
 bataaiye puure saal japan kii sari trainon kaa let chalane kaa ausat ek minute bhi nahin he
 In India, even after 71 hours, no one apologizes nor is angry at it
 bharat main kya hota he
 Do we know our rights, use them, have we got so many rights, why don't we talk about rights? yah mudda kyon nahin he, kyon yatri 30 se 70 ghante kii yatnaa bhi sehate hai or badale main unhen kuch miltaa bhi nahin he
 We went to http: / / www

 agar aapaki train teen ghante se zyaada kii deree se chal rahi ho to aap apana tikat yatra shuru hone ke stesan par cancil kara sakate hai
 In return you will get the fare back without any deduction
 agar aap dilli se patna gaye or vahaan se haavda kii train leni he, deree hone ke kaaran agar haavda kii train chhot jaati he to aisi sthiti main patna se haavda kaa kiraaya waapas ho jayega
 But for this, you will have to return the ticket within three hours after reaching Patna
 ye niyam to he magar hakeekat yah he ki bhartiya rail main conform tikat milanaa itnaa mushkil he ki jise bhi tikat miltaa he vah let hone par cancel nahin karaata he
 Sitting for thirty hours and singing for fifty hours, we go on the same train
 18 april 2018 ke financial express main ek or khabar mili
 If Rajdhani and Duronto are late for more than two hours after a 20-hour journey, then the passenger will get one bottle of Rail Neer free from the railway side
 bottle ke saath cap bhi hoga
 Anyway, travelers get one bottle free
 is meharbaani par kiskaa dil na aa jaae
 Rajdhani Express is generally known for running on time but it is not so now
 11 may ko dibrugarh rajdhani jo dibrugarh se nai dilli aati he 4 ghante 38 minute let thi
 etrain
 info ek privet site he
 If you enter the train number on it, then you can see the record for the year
 shivank ne is site par research kar bataaya ki dibrugarh rajdhani pichley saal 9 oktober ko 13 ghante let thi
 If we see the average running time, then this train is late by 2 hours
 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani express 26 march ko 11 ghante let ai
 The weather is fine in March
 9 may ko 20501 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani 4 ghante 35 minute kii deree se pahunchi
 Express train is late, passenger train is late, local train is in the same condition, except Rajdhani is not reaching on time
 rajdhani or duranton ke yatriyon ko let hone par ek bottle pani free mil rahaa he, lekin paseegenr, superfast to 20-30 ghante kii deree se chalati he, unke yatriyon ke liye pani kaa bolat free kyon nahin he
 The tap with which the mother is giving water to her child at Patna station, how little water comes from the tap
 vah ek or nal par jaati he jahaan kuch log pani bhar rahe hai
 The tap is locked in the cage
 jab habib kaa camera kareeb se dekhtaa he to pani kii boonden tapak rahi hoti hai
 This man could barely fill the water, he strangled him
 aam logon ke liye pani bhi kitni mushkil se tapakataa he
 When you wait for the train for 30 hours at the station, how much will be spent on the water itself
 khaane par kitna kharch hota hoga
 All these should be accounted for
 sirf chinia baadaam kaa kharchaa nahin joda jayega
 a wedding machine is installed at the station from which people are buying water
 pani kaa rate aap dekh lijie
 300 ml 1 rupees, if taken with the bottle, you will have to pay 2 rupees
 500 emal pani ke liye 3 rupaya, bottle ke saath 5 rupaya
 You have to pay 8 rupees for 2 liters and 12 rupees if you take the bottle
 ye iarsitisi kaa water vending mashin he
 Now think what will be your condition if you are traveling by amritsar-darumbhaga Jannayak Express
 steshnon se muft pani kaa system khatm hota ja rahaa he yaa kam hota ja rahaa he, itani bheed hoti he ki bharte bharte train chalane lagati he
 On the website of national train inquiry system, you enter the number of 15215 Jannayak Express
 isamen ausat deree kaa bhi ek kollam he
 If you click on it, it will be known that the average delay of reaching Amritsar Darbhanga Jannayak Express Darbhanga station is 21 hours 38 minutes
 yah ausat 2 november 2017 se he
 Tell that for the last six months this train is reaching Darbhanga with a delay of 21 hours 38 minutes
 hamane apni rail series main is train par kaaphi jor diya he magar koi sudhaar nahin he
 The average time for this train to reach Darbhanga from May 1 to May 7 is 20 hours 37 minutes
 ye nunatam deree bataa rahe hai
 The maximum delay time is 58 hours 58 minutes
 ye vaali jaankaree etrain
 is extracted from the website of info
 4 may ko koun si train 58 ghante 58 minute kii deree se pahunchi he, aap is tarah ke sawaal rail mantri se unke twitor handle par na karen
 The example of Jananayak Express is given because there is not a single AC coach in this train
 sabhi general hai
 It is obvious that when a train is late for 20 hours to 58 hours, the workers will also feel thirsty
 kya railway ko rajdhani or duranton kii tarah inhen pani kii bottle or khaanaa nahin dena chahie
 Now we tell the condition of a train
 ek yatri ne train ke bare main soochna di or mobile se video record kar bheja he
 This train runs between Gorakhpur to Siwan
 kushinagar tamakuhi road se hokar guzarati he
 The video sent by the passenger shows the condition of the coach but the crowd is very large
 yah video do teen din pehle kaa he
 Passenger told that the time to open from Gorakhpur is at 5
10 am, but it is delayed by several hours
 isaki seat bahut choti he
 Passengers stand and walk
 prime time ke liye research main madad kar rahe shivank ne itrain info se bataaya ki yah train 166 kimi kii duuri 5 ghante main puraa karti he
 If you find the average of its latency and then calculate the speed, then this train runs at an average speed of 24 km per hour, that is, equivalent to a freight train
 31 may 2017 ko yah train 11 kisi prati ghante kii raftaar se chali he
 It is lying 294 times in a year
 12 baar radd hui he
 The maximum delay is 10 hours and the average delay is 1 hour 42 minutes
 is train main saadhaaran log safar karte hai
 Passengers are also disturbed by the crowd
 prime time ke zarie yatri chaahate hai ki rail mantri ise dekhen or kuch karen
 To reduce congestion, run another train or increase the coach
 tippaniyan Do you know that the loco pilots driving the train are celebrating Black Day on 14 May, 15 May and 16 May
 inke pradarshan kaa naam he mundi garam pradarshan
 These people want the engine to have AC because the condition gets worse in the hot summer
 inaki kuch maangen hamaari samaj se baahar hai kyonki ham loko payalat kii vyavastha ko nahin jaanate hai
 Paramjit Singh, president of the Northern Region of All India Loco Running Staff Association, said that according to the 7th Pay Commission, an allowance of Rs 848 should be given on 100 km while Rs 250
 inkaa daawa he ki loko payalat ke liye manzur padon kii sankhya ek lakh he magar is vakt 85,000 loko payalat hai
 Due to the shortage of 15,000, they have to work more than 10 hours
 gaadi chalaane ke liye thik nahin he
 Night duty of 6-7 days is given
 kai baar hafte kii chuttee bhi nahin milti he
 He has taken out a form
 isamen likhaa he ki adhikari ke mundi kaa taapmaana 19 degree celsius hota he yani ve asi main kaam karte hai or rail ingine ke payalat kii mundi kaa taapmaana 58 degree celsius hota he kyonki ve bina asi ke kaam karte hai
 Whereas in the Rail Budget, provision has been made to install AC in the engine
 dharna pradarshan kaa naam hi vicitra he
 Shave hot pradarshan kaa aisa naam to maine bhi kabhi nahin suna tha
 Many passengers do not even know what your rights are due to train delays
 kam hi log hai jo sidhaa rail mantri yaa rail mantralay ke twitor handle par twit kar pate hai
 Seemanchal Express has run an average of 12 hours late in the year according to the Eatrain Info
 praaia yah train 10 ghante, 20 ghante or kabhi kabhi to 50 ghante kii deree se chalati hi he
 We raised the issue of this train a lot
 1 may se 7 may ke bich yah train nunatam 5 ghante kii deree se chali he or adhiktam 38 ghante kii deree se
 But if we raise the issue, then there is no significant improvement in its timing
 neshnal train inquairi system main ek hafte kaa hi data hota he
 - Seemanchal Express reached Anand Vihar Terminal on May 9 with a delay of 11 hours 25 minutes - 10 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 8 ghanta 17 minute kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 11 with a delay of 12 hours - 12 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 15 minute kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 13 with a delay of 6 hours 20 minutes lekin simanchal 11 may ke baad se anand vihaar se jogbani ke liye har din samay par khuli he
 This is a big change
 khulti samay par he, ham khush hote hai, magar raste main let ho jaati he
 Our colleague Ajay Singh went to Varanasi station
 stesan to kaaphi saaf suthra ho gaya he
 One should not panic by seeing the crowds at the station, because the train runs on time or not, the crowd is an integral part of the Indian Railways
 ajay singh dopaher baad chaar baje ke kareeb varanasi stesan par the
 There he noticed that most of the long distance trains were running late
 14004 anand vihaar-patna express 8 ghante let, 13238 patna-mathura 8 ghante let, 12370 kumbh express 10 ghante let chal rahi he
 When we put Varanasi station in the National Train Inquiry System, it showed that within eight hours 26 trains were seen running late there
 gorakhpur shalimaar express nunatam 10 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi or haridwar haavda superfast express 12 ghante 14 minute kii deree se chal rahi thi
 Ajay was at the station when 19306 going from Guwahati to Indore reached Varanasi with a delay of 10 hours
 ajay singh ko varanasi stesan par deree ke maare yatri apni pareshaani is ummid main bataane lage ki shaayad rail mantri kaa dhyaan jayega or ve deree se mukti dilaayenge
 a family was found who had gone to Chhapra for BHU treatment, they could not get treatment even after reaching the Varanasi due to the delayed running of the train
 unhone bataaya ki jinka sampark nahin tha wo aspataal main apana number nahin laga sake
 Their arrival became useless
 yahi dikkat kisi din airport par ho jaae to us din channel bhi netaaon ke bayaan chhodkar hawaii adde par pahunch jaaenge
 The coverage of the rail is reduced during the fog, but the delay is considered normal on normal days
 koi parvaah bhi nahin karata ki is deree se logon ke jivan par kya asar padataa he

 a news dated 17 November 2017 was discussed worldwide
 japan main sukovo express line ke prabandhakon ne tokyo or sukova ke bich chalane vaali train ke liye maafee maangi kyonki vah 20 second pehle khul gai thi
 In Japan, when the train is late, every passenger is given a certificate
 lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki japan main salanaa ausat deree kitni he
 0 only
 9 minute
 Tell us that the average speed of all trains in Japan throughout the year is not even one minute
 bharat main to 71 ghante baad bhi pahunch kar na to koi maafee maangata he na is par naaraaz hota he
 What happens in India? kya ham apane adhikaar jaanate hai, uskaa istamaal karte hai, kya itane adhikaar mili bhi hai, aakhir ham adhikaron kii baat kyon nahin karte hai
 Why is this not the issue, why the passengers endure 30 to 70 hours of torture and they do not get anything in return
 ham iske liye gaye http: / / www

 If your train is running late by more than three hours, you can cancel your ticket at the station of the journey
 iske badale main aapako bina katautee ke kiraaya waapas milegaa
 If you go from Delhi to Patna and have to take Howrah train from there, if you miss the Howrah train due to delay then in such a situation the fare from Patna to Howrah will be refunded
 magar iske liye aapako patna pahunch kar teen ghante ke bheetar tikat waapas karnaa hoga
 This is the rule, but the reality is that it is so difficult to get confirmed tickets in the Indian Railways that whoever gets the tickets does not cancel when they are late
 rote gaate tees ghante, pachaas ghante baithkar usee train main jaataa he
 Financial Express of 18 April 2018 received another news
 agar rajdhani or duranton 20 ghante ke safar ke baad do ghante se zyaada let hoti he to yatri ko railway kii taraf se rail nir kaa ek bottle muft milegaa
 There will also be a cup with the bottle
 vaise bhi yatriyon ko ek bottle muft miltaa he
 Whose heart does not come on this kindness
 aam taur par rajdhani express samay se chalane ke liye jaani jaati he magar ab aisa nahin he
 On May 11, Dibrugarh Rajdhani which comes from Dibrugarh to New Delhi was 4 hours 38 minutes late
 etrain
 info is a private site
 is par aap train number daalenge to saal bhar kaa record dekh sakate hai
 Shivank did research on this site and told that Dibrugarh Rajdhani was late for 13 hours on October 9 last year
 iske samay se chalane kaa ausat dekhenge to yah train 2 ghante let hoti he
 Rajdhani Express from Agartala to Anand Vihar was delayed by 11 hours on 26 March
 march main to mausam thik hi hota he
 On 9 May 20501, the capital from Agartala to Anand Vihar arrived 4 hours 35 minutes late
 express train let he, paisanger train let he, local train kaa vahi haal he, rajdhani bhi kuch ko chhod samay par nahin pahunch rahi he
 Passengers in the capital and Duronto are getting a bottle of water for free when they are late, but the passenger, superfast, is delayed by 20-30 hours, why the water is not free for their passengers
 patna stesan par maa apane bachche ko jis nal se pani pilaa rahi he, nal se kitna kam pani aata he
 She goes to another tap where some people are filling up with water
 nal pinjre main band he
 When Habib's camera looks closely, drops of water are dripping
 yah janaab to mushkil se pani bhar paae, usee se galaa tar kar liya
 How hard water is dripping for common people
 jab aap stesan par 30 ghante train kaa intazaar karte hai to pani par hi kitna kharch ho jaataa hoga
 How much will it cost to eat in sab kaa hisaab joda janaa chahie
 Only the cost of Chinia almonds will not be added
 stesan par ek wedding mashin lagi he jisase log pani kharid rahe hai
 See the rate of water
 300 emel 1 rupaya, agar bottle ke saath lenge to 2 rupaya dena hoga
 3 rupees for 500ml water, 5 rupees with bottle
 2 litre ke liye 8 rupee dene honge or agar bottle bhi lenge to 12 rupee
 It is the water vending machine of IRCTC
 ab sochie agar aap amritsar-darambhaga jananaayak express se yatra kar rahe hon to aapaki kya haalat hogi
 The free water system from the stations is getting depleted or decreasing, so crowded that trains start filling up
 national train enquiry system kii website par aap train 15212 jananaayak express kaa number daaliye
 It also has a column of average delay
 use clic karenge to pataa chalegaa ki amritsar darbhanga jananaayak express darbhanga stesan par pahunchane kii ausat deree 21 ghanta 38 minute he
 This average is from 2 November 2017
 bataaiye pichley chah maheene se yah train 21 ghante 38 minute kii deree se darbhanga pahunch rahi he
 We have put a lot of emphasis on this train in our rail series but there is no improvement
 1 may se 7 may ke bich is train ke darbhanga pahunchane kaa ausat he 20 ghante 37 minute
 These are the minimum delays
 adhiktam deree kaa samay he 58 ghante 58 minute
 Information containing these
 info kii website se nikaali he
 On 4 May, which train has arrived late by 58 hours 58 minutes, do not ask such questions to Railway Minister on his Twitter handle
 jananaayak express kaa udhaaharan isliye diya kyonki is train main ek bhi asi coach nahin he
 All are generals
 zaahir he jab koi train 20 ghante se lekar 58 ghante tak let hogi to mazaduron ko pyaas bhi lagati hogi
 Should the railways not give them water bottles and food like the Rajdhanis and the Durants
 ab ham ek train kaa haal bataate hai
 a passenger gave information about the train and recorded the video from mobile
 yah train gorakhpur se sivaan ke bich chalati he
 Kushinagar passes through Tamkuhi Road
 yatri ne jo video bheja he usase coach kii haalat to thik dikhti he magar bheed bahut he
 This video is from 2-3 days ago
 yatri ne bataaya ki gorakhpur se khulne kaa samay he 5 bajkar 10 minute par, magar kai ghante kii deree se khulti he
 Its seat is very small
 yatri khadey hokar hi chalate hai
 Shivank, who is assisting in research for prime time, told Eatrain Info that this train completes a distance of 166 km in 5 hours
 agar iske let hone kaa ausat nikaalen or phir raftaar kaa hisaab karen to yah train ausatan 24 kimi prati ghante kii raftaar se chalati he yani kii malgadee ke baraabar
 On 31 May 2017, this train has run at a speed of 11 kph
 ek saal main 294 baar let hui he
 Has been canceled 12 times
 adhiktam deree 10 ghante or ausat deree 1 ghanta 42 minute he
 Ordinary people travel in this train
 yatri bheed se bhi pareshaan hai
 Through prime time, passengers want the railway minister to see it and do something
 bheed kam karne ke liye ek or rail chalaa den yaa phir coach badha den
 The comments kya aap jaanate hai ki rail gaadi chalaane vaale loko payalat 14 may, 15 may or 16 may ko kaala diwas manaa rahe hai
 The name of his performance is Mundi hot performance
 ye log chaahate hai ki ingine main asi kii vyavastha ho kyonki tej garmi main haalat kharaab ho jaati he
 Some of their demands are beyond our comprehension because we do not know the system of loco pilot
 ol india loko running staff sangh ke uttari kshetra ke adhyaksh paramjeet singh ne kaha ki 7wein vetan ayog ke hisaab 100 kimi par 848 rupaya bhatta milanaa chahie jabaki miltaa he 250 rupaya
 They claim that the number of posts sanctioned for loco pilots is one lakh but at present there are 85,000 loco pilots
 15000 kii kami ke kaaran inhen 10 ghante se zyaada kaam karnaa padaa he
 It is not okay to drive
 6-7 dinon kii nit duty di jaati he
 Many times a week holiday is not available
 inhone ek parchaa nikaala he
 It states that the temperature of the officer's mundi is 19 ° C, that is, they work in AC and the temperature of the mule of a pilot of a rail engine is 58 ° c because they work without AC
 jabaki rail bajet main ingine main asi lagane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 The name of the demonstration is peculiar
 mundi garam
 i had never even heard such a performance name
 - simanchal express 9 may ko anand vihaar terminal pahunchi he 11 ghanta 25 minute kii deree se - reached Anand Vihar on May 10 with a delay of 8 hours 17 minutes - 11 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 12 ghante kii deree se - Reached Anand Vihar on May 12 with a delay of 6 hours 15 minutes - 13 may ko anand vihaar pahunchi he 6 ghanta 20 minute kii deree se But Seemanchal is open on time every day from May 11 to Anand Jogbani since May 11

 It is on opening time, we are happy, but it is late on the way
 hamaare sahyogi ajay singh varanasi stesan par gaye
 The station has become very clean
 stesan par bheed dekhakar nahin ghabraana chahie, kyonki train samay se chale yaa na chale, bheed bhartiya railway kaa abhinn hissaa he
 Ajay Singh was at Varanasi station around four in the afternoon
 vahaan unhone dekha ki lambii duuri kii zyaadaatar trainen deree se chal rahi thim
 14004 Anand vihar-patna Express 8 hours late, 13238 patna-mathura 8 hours late, 12370 Kumbh Express is running 10 hours late

 Gorakhpur Shalimar Express was running at least 10 minutes late and Haridwar Howrah Superfast Express was running late by 12 hours 14 minutes
 ajay stesan par hi the jab guwahati se indore jane vaali 19306 10 ghante kii deree se varanasi pahunchi
 Passengers delayed by delaying Ajay Singh at Varanasi station began to convey their problems in the hope that perhaps the Railway Minister would get attention and they would get rid of the delay
 ek parivaar mila jo chhapra se biechayu ilaaj ke liye chalaa tha, wo train ke deree se chalane ke kaaran varanasi pahunch kar bhi ilaaj nahin kara sakaa
 He told that those who were not contacted could not put their number in the hospital
 unka aana bekaar ho gaya
 If the same problem happens at the airport someday, then on that day the channels will also leave the statements of the leaders and reach the airport
 kohre ke samay rail kaa kawarej to ho jaataa he magar aam dinon main deree ko saamaanya maan liya jaataa he
 Nobody cares what effect this delay has on people's lives
 aaj ham aapako bataanaa chaahate hai ki europe main agar train let hoti he to tab yatriyon ko kya kya miltaa he, phir aapako bataaenge ki bharat main aapaki train let ho gai, aapkaa imtahaan chhot gaya to aapako kya muawza miltaa he
 - First you go to europa
 eu kii website par
 - If the train is canceled, late, then you should be informed on time, it is your right

 - do ghante se zyaada kii deree hone par 50 fisadi kiraaya waapas kiya jayega
 - If you are informed about the delay in advance, you will not get anything
 17 november 2017 kii ek khabar duniya bhar main charchit hui thi
 The managers of the Tsukovo Express Line in Japan apologized for the train running between Tokyo and Tsukova as it had opened 20 seconds earlier
 japan main train let hoti he to har yatri ko ek certificate diya jaataa he
 But do you know how much the average annual delay is in Japan
 maatr 0
 9 minutes
 bataaiye puure saal japan kii sari trainon kaa let chalane kaa ausat ek minute bhi nahin he
 In India, even after 71 hours, no one apologizes nor is angry at it
 bharat main kya hota he
 Do we know our rights, use them, have we got so many rights, why don't we talk about rights? yah mudda kyon nahin he, kyon yatri 30 se 70 ghante kii yatnaa bhi sehate hai or badale main unhen kuch miltaa bhi nahin he
 We went to http: / / www

 indianrailways
 gov
 in on
 agar aapaki train teen ghante se zyaada kii deree se chal rahi ho to aap apana tikat yatra shuru hone ke stesan par cancil kara sakate hai
 In return you will get the fare back without any deduction
 agar aap dilli se patna gaye or vahaan se haavda kii train leni he, deree hone ke kaaran agar haavda kii train chhot jaati he to aisi sthiti main patna se haavda kaa kiraaya waapas ho jayega
 But for this, you will have to return the ticket within three hours after reaching Patna
 ye niyam to he magar hakeekat yah he ki bhartiya rail main conform tikat milanaa itnaa mushkil he ki jise bhi tikat miltaa he vah let hone par cancel nahin karaata he
 Sitting for thirty hours and singing for fifty hours, we go on the same train
 18 april 2018 ke financial express main ek or khabar mili
 If Rajdhani and Duronto are late for more than two hours after a 20-hour journey, then the passenger will get one bottle of Rail Neer free from the railway side
 bottle ke saath cap bhi hoga
 Anyway, travelers get one bottle free
 is meharbaani par kiskaa dil na aa jaae
 Rajdhani Express is generally known for running on time but it is not so now
 11 may ko dibrugarh rajdhani jo dibrugarh se nai dilli aati he 4 ghante 38 minute let thi
 etrain

 If you enter the train number on it, then you can see the record for the year
 shivank ne is site par research kar bataaya ki dibrugarh rajdhani pichley saal 9 oktober ko 13 ghante let thi
 If we see the average running time, then this train is late by 2 hours
 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani express 26 march ko 11 ghante let ai
 The weather is fine in March
 9 may ko 20501 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani 4 ghante 35 minute kii deree se pahunchi
 Express train is late, passenger train is late, local train is in the same condition, except Rajdhani is not reaching on time
 rajdhani or duranton ke yatriyon ko let hone par ek bottle pani free mil rahaa he, lekin paseegenr, superfast to 20-30 ghante kii deree se chalati he, unke yatriyon ke liye pani kaa bolat free kyon nahin he
 The tap with which the mother is giving water to her child at Patna station, how little water comes from the tap
 vah ek or nal par jaati he jahaan kuch log pani bhar rahe hai
 The tap is locked in the cage
 jab habib kaa camera kareeb se dekhtaa he to pani kii boonden tapak rahi hoti hai
 This man could barely fill the water, he strangled him
 aam logon ke liye pani bhi kitni mushkil se tapakataa he
 When you wait for the train for 30 hours at the station, how much will be spent on the water itself
 khaane par kitna kharch hota hoga
 All these should be accounted for
 sirf chinia baadaam kaa kharchaa nahin joda jayega
 a wedding machine is installed at the station from which people are buying water
 pani kaa rate aap dekh lijie
 300 ml 1 rupees, if taken with the bottle, you will have to pay 2 rupees
 500 emal pani ke liye 3 rupaya, bottle ke saath 5 rupaya
 You have to pay 8 rupees for 2 liters and 12 rupees if you take the bottle

 Now we tell the condition of a train

 Tell us that the average speed of all trains in Japan throughout the year is not even one minute
 bharat main to 71 ghante baad bhi pahunch kar na to koi maafee maangata he na is par naaraaz hota he
 What happens in India? kya ham apane adhikaar jaanate hai, uskaa istamaal karte hai, kya itane adhikaar mili bhi hai, aakhir ham adhikaron kii baat kyon nahin karte hai

 If your train is running late by more than three hours, you can cancel your ticket at the station of the journey
 iske badale main aapako bina katautee ke kiraaya waapas milegaa
 If you go from Delhi to Patna and have to take Howrah train from there, if you miss the Howrah train due to delay then in such a situation the fare from Patna to Howrah will be refunded
 magar iske liye aapako patna pahunch kar teen ghante ke bheetar tikat waapas karnaa hoga
 This is the rule, but the reality is that it is so difficult to get confirmed tickets in the Indian Railways that whoever gets the tickets does not cancel when they are late
 rote gaate tees ghante, pachaas ghante baithkar usee train main jaataa he
 Financial Express of 18 April 2018 received another news
 agar rajdhani or duranton 20 ghante ke safar ke baad do ghante se zyaada let hoti he to yatri ko railway kii taraf se rail nir kaa ek bottle muft milegaa
 There will also be a cup with the bottle
 vaise bhi yatriyon ko ek bottle muft miltaa he
 Whose heart does not come on this kindness
 aam taur par rajdhani express samay se chalane ke liye jaani jaati he magar ab aisa nahin he
 On May 11, Dibrugarh Rajdhani which comes from Dibrugarh to New Delhi was 4 hours 38 minutes late
 etrain
 info is a private site
 is par aap train number daalenge to saal bhar kaa record dekh sakate hai
 Shivank did research on this site and told that Dibrugarh Rajdhani was late for 13 hours on October 9 last year
 iske samay se chalane kaa ausat dekhenge to yah train 2 ghante let hoti he
 Rajdhani Express from Agartala to Anand Vihar was delayed by 11 hours on 26 March
 march main to mausam thik hi hota he
 On 9 May 20501, the capital from Agartala to Anand Vihar arrived 4 hours 35 minutes late
 express train let he, paisanger train let he, local train kaa vahi haal he, rajdhani bhi kuch ko chhod samay par nahin pahunch rahi he
 Passengers in the capital and Duronto are getting a bottle of water for free when they are late, but the passenger, superfast, is delayed by 20-30 hours, why the water is not free for their passengers
 patna stesan par maa apane bachche ko jis nal se pani pilaa rahi he, nal se kitna kam pani aata he
 She goes to another tap where some people are filling up with water
 nal pinjre main band he
 When Habib's camera looks closely, drops of water are dripping
 yah janaab to mushkil se pani bhar paae, usee se galaa tar kar liya
 How hard water is dripping for common people
 jab aap stesan par 30 ghante train kaa intazaar karte hai to pani par hi kitna kharch ho jaataa hoga
 How much will it cost to eat in sab kaa hisaab joda janaa chahie
 Only the cost of Chinia almonds will not be added
 stesan par ek wedding mashin lagi he jisase log pani kharid rahe hai
 See the rate of water
 300 emel 1 rupaya, agar bottle ke saath lenge to 2 rupaya dena hoga
 3 rupees for 500ml water, 5 rupees with bottle
 2 litre ke liye 8 rupee dene honge or agar bottle bhi lenge to 12 rupee
 It is the water vending machine of IRCTC
 ab sochie agar aap amritsar-darambhaga jananaayak express se yatra kar rahe hon to aapaki kya haalat hogi
 The free water system from the stations is getting depleted or decreasing, so crowded that trains start filling up
 national train enquiry system kii website par aap train 15212 jananaayak express kaa number daaliye
 It also has a column of average delay

 If your train is running late by more than three hours, you can cancel your ticket at the station of the journey
 iske badale main aapako bina katautee ke kiraaya waapas milegaa
 If you go from Delhi to Patna and have to take Howrah train from there, if you miss the Howrah train due to delay then in such a situation the fare from Patna to Howrah will be refunded
 magar iske liye aapako patna pahunch kar teen ghante ke bheetar tikat waapas karnaa hoga
 This is the rule, but the reality is that it is so difficult to get confirmed tickets in the Indian Railways that whoever gets the tickets does not cancel when they are late
 rote gaate tees ghante, pachaas ghante baithkar usee train main jaataa he
 Financial Express of 18 April 2018 received another news
 agar rajdhani or duranton 20 ghante ke safar ke baad do ghante se zyaada let hoti he to yatri ko railway kii taraf se rail nir kaa ek bottle muft milegaa
 There will also be a cup with the bottle
 vaise bhi yatriyon ko ek bottle muft miltaa he
 Whose heart does not come on this kindness
 aam taur par rajdhani express samay se chalane ke liye jaani jaati he magar ab aisa nahin he

 Shivank did research on this site and told that Dibrugarh Rajdhani was late for 13 hours on October 9 last year
 iske samay se chalane kaa ausat dekhenge to yah train 2 ghante let hoti he
 Rajdhani Express from Agartala to Anand Vihar was delayed by 11 hours on 26 March
 march main to mausam thik hi hota he
 On 9 May 20501, the capital from Agartala to Anand Vihar arrived 4 hours 35 minutes late
 express train let he, paisanger train let he, local train kaa vahi haal he, rajdhani bhi kuch ko chhod samay par nahin pahunch rahi he
 Passengers in the capital and Duronto are getting a bottle of water for free when they are late, but the passenger, superfast, is delayed by 20-30 hours, why the water is not free for their passengers
 patna stesan par maa apane bachche ko jis nal se pani pilaa rahi he, nal se kitna kam pani aata he
 She goes to another tap where some people are filling up with water
 nal pinjre main band he
 When Habib's camera looks closely, drops of water are dripping
 yah janaab to mushkil se pani bhar paae, usee se galaa tar kar liya
 How hard water is dripping for common people
 jab aap stesan par 30 ghante train kaa intazaar karte hai to pani par hi kitna kharch ho jaataa hoga
 How much will it cost to eat in sab kaa hisaab joda janaa chahie
 Only the cost of Chinia almonds will not be added
 stesan par ek wedding mashin lagi he jisase log pani kharid rahe hai
 See the rate of water
 300 emel 1 rupaya, agar bottle ke saath lenge to 2 rupaya dena hoga
 3 rupees for 500ml water, 5 rupees with bottle
 2 litre ke liye 8 rupee dene honge or agar bottle bhi lenge to 12 rupee
 It is the water vending machine of IRCTC
 ab sochie agar aap amritsar-darambhaga jananaayak express se yatra kar rahe hon to aapaki kya haalat hogi
 The free water system from the stations is getting depleted or decreasing, so crowded that trains start filling up

 Sitting for thirty hours and singing for fifty hours, we go on the same train
 18 april 2018 ke financial express main ek or khabar mili
 If Rajdhani and Duronto are late for more than two hours after a 20-hour journey, then the passenger will get one bottle of Rail Neer free from the railway side
 bottle ke saath cap bhi hoga
 Anyway, travelers get one bottle free
 is meharbaani par kiskaa dil na aa jaae
 Rajdhani Express is generally known for running on time but it is not so now
 11 may ko dibrugarh rajdhani jo dibrugarh se nai dilli aati he 4 ghante 38 minute let thi
 etrain
 info ek privet site he
 If you enter the train number on it, then you can see the record for the year
 shivank ne is site par research kar bataaya ki dibrugarh rajdhani pichley saal 9 oktober ko 13 ghante let thi
 If we see the average running time, then this train is late by 2 hours
 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani express 26 march ko 11 ghante let ai
 The weather is fine in March
 9 may ko 20501 agartala se anand vihaar aane vaali rajdhani 4 ghante 35 minute kii deree se pahunchi
 Express train is late, passenger train is late, local train is in the same condition, except Rajdhani is not reaching on time

 The tap with which the mother is giving water to her child at Patna station, how little water comes from the tap
 vah ek or nal par jaati he jahaan kuch log pani bhar rahe hai
 The tap is locked in the cage
 jab habib kaa camera kareeb se dekhtaa he to pani kii boonden tapak rahi hoti hai
 This man could barely fill the water, he strangled him
 aam logon ke liye pani bhi kitni mushkil se tapakataa he
 When you wait for the train for 30 hours at the station, how much will be spent on the water itself
 khaane par kitna kharch hota hoga
 All these should be accounted for
 sirf chinia baadaam kaa kharchaa nahin joda jayega
 a wedding machine is installed at the station from which people are buying water
 pani kaa rate aap dekh lijie
 300 ml 1 rupees, if taken with the bottle, you will have to pay 2 rupees
 500 emal pani ke liye 3 rupaya, bottle ke saath 5 rupaya
 You have to pay 8 rupees for 2 liters and 12 rupees if you take the bottle
