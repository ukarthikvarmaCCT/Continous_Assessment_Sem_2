 com / bepleqm8vp— Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk)february 25, 2019work front kii baat karen to shahrukh in dinon apane production house kii film "badla" ke pramotion main biji chal rahe hai
 It stars Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee Pannu in the lead roles
 iskaa trailor haal hi main relies kiya gaya tha
 There are reports that Shahrukh is also in a cameo role
 haalanki, diarector sujoy ghosh ne ise lekar koi pushti nahin kii he
 Shah Rukh and Amitabh have also shot a special video to promote the film
 badla agle maheene 8 march ko relies ho rahi he
 While anchoring the most popular crime show on television, he himself became a criminal
 kabhi desh bhar ke khoonkhaar mujarimon kii ankhon kii kirakiri ban chuke suhaib eliyasi kii takadir kaa faisla aaj dilli kii ek adaalat ne kar diya
 Suhaib, accused of killing his own wife, has been sentenced to life imprisonment
 saath hi adaalat ne eliyasi par das lakh rupee kaa jurmaana bhi kiya he
 Suhaib, who had caught many criminals through the crime show 'india's Most Wanted', had written the script of Suicide vigorously after killing his wife, but he could not save himself from the sharp eyes of the law
 haalanki, sarkari vakil ne is cese main doshi qaraar die gaye suhaib ke liye faansee kii sajaa kii maang kii thi, lekin adaalat ne umrakaid diya
 The family lawyer said that he used to make serials on the crimes
 log isko dekhte the, lekin isane usee se sikh lekar is ghatana ko anjaam diya
 It tried to make the murder case a suicide
 ye jaghanya aparaadh kaa maamla he
 Before that Suhayb said, 'I am innocent
 main upree adaalat main is aadesh ke khilaaf apil karunga
 i will take all the evidence in the High Court
 'usne kaha, 'mujhe ummid he ki vahaan mujhe nyaay milegaa
 There is no concrete evidence against me
 ' uske vakil ne kaha ki ye puraa maamla paristhitijanya saakshyon par aadhaarit he
 There is no eyewitness to this
 lihaaza is maamle ko durlabh kii shrenee me nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 Apart from this, vandalism or planned conspiracy has not been done in this case
 1998 main apana krime sho shuru karne ke baad suhaib televijan kii duniya kaa charchit cheharaa ban gaya
 Soon after, Suhayb Ilyasi's name became famous through this show
 lekin 17 saal pehle kiye gaye ek aparaadh ne usase uskaa sara staradam chin liya
 On January 11, 2000, Suheb's wife Anju Ilyasi died in mysterious circumstances
 shuru main to suhaib police ko ankhon main dhul jhonkne main safal rahaa
 He made the murder of his wife a story of suicide
 lekin 17 saal baad isi shanivaar ko dilli kii nichali adaalat ne anju kii maut ke liye suhaib eliyasi ko doshi qaraar diya
 Now just punishment has to be announced
 suhaib ne apni patni kii maut ko suicide bataaya, lekin yah uski khud kii likhi gai kahani thi
 The reality is that he murdered his wife
 eliyasi ne apni patni kii maut kii khabar sabase pehle apane dost ko di
 Suhayb tells his friend that his wife Anju has committed suicide
 lekin jaise hi yah baat anju ke parivaar waalon ko pataa chalaa to unhone iljaam lagaaya ki anju suicide nahin kar sakati, balki uskaa katl kiya gaya he
 The police registered a case and started the investigation and arrested Suhaib Ilyasi in March 2000 on dowry death charges
 lekin kuch samay baad hi vah bel par baahar aa gaya
 Anju's family was not happy with the police investigation
 ve maamle ko lekar hai court pahunche
 In 2014, the High Court asked the police to investigate the case in the murder sections
 police ne jaanch shuru kii
 Then an investigation of evidence started from scratch
 jaanch main police ne paaya ki suhaib eliyasi ne hi apni patni kii hatya kii thi
 The killing was done with scissors
 darasal jo suut anju ne pahana tha us par kaichi kaa cat nahin tha
 Not only this, one of the 3 doctors who did the post-mortem also raised suspicion of murder
 iske baad 5 doctoron kaa ek or panel banaaya gaya
 Those doctors suspected the murder of Anju's death
 darasal anju kii maut 10 bajkar 45 minute par hui thi, jabaki suhaib use 12 bajkar 26 minute par ames lekar pahunchaa tha
 Police also found traces of blood in the bathroom
 itnaa hi nahi jaanch main yah baat bhi saamne ai ki donon main aksar jhagada hota rahata tha or donon ke rishton main khatas aa gai thi
 The police put all the evidence in front of the court and the court convicted Suhaib Ilyasi for murder
 aaj dilli kii kadakadduma court ab suhaib ko uskegunaahon ke liye sajaa kaa elaanakregi
 Suhaib Ilyasi and Anju were studying together at Jamia Millia Islamia in 1989
 tabhi donon ke bich pyaar hua
 The family members of Anju protested about this relation
 iske baad donon landan chale gaye
 Suhaib and Anju got married in London in 1993, despite opposition from family members
 suhaib ne apane gunaah kii jo script taiyaar kii vah behad hi shaatiranaa thi
 He erased the mark of his crime and crime so much that once his story was believed by everyone
 lekin aakhirkaar police kii mukammal tafteesh kii badaulat uski script juthi sabit hui

 The woman accused Johri that, 'I met Rahul Johri in connection with the job

 Prior to becoming the CEO of BCCI, Rahul Johri served as Executive Vice President and General Manager (south Asia) of Discovery Network Asia Pacific

 According to the shared opinion, Rahul Johri took the woman to his house when his wife was not there

 The India today-axis My India exit poll predicts bjp's absolute majority in UP but the final results will come only after the counting of votes on March 11
 agar trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti aati he to gathbandhan ke halaat banenge
 We are saying this because Akhilesh Yadav himself has indicated to go with Mayawati
 raajnneeti main kuch bhi sambhav he
 If there is a coalition situation, what will be the option before UP? Option-1: BJP is supporting BSP in the exit polls
 BJP is projected to have an absolute majority but some exit polls are showing BJP as the largest party
 agar aisa hota he to bijepi ko bispi ke samarthan kii jarurat pad sakati he
 An alliance between BJP and BSP is most likely in the event of a hung assembly after the election
 agar bijepi badi party banati he to bispi use samarthan de sakati he
 Even before, both parties have formed a government together
 haalanki, chunavi reliyon main donon dalon ke netaaon ke bich bayanon main khub talkhi dekhne ko mili lekin raajnneeti main kuch bhi asambhav nahin he
 The two parties can come together again to stop the sp-congress
 mayawati bhi centre kii sarkaar ke saath milakar or upi kii satta se judakar apni raajnneetik jameen phir se majboot karne kii koshish kar sakati hai
 The bsp's account was not even opened in the Lok Sabha elections and everything will now depend on the results of the assembly elections
 vikalp-2: bispi ko bijepi kaa samarthanagar bispi sabase bade dal ke rup main ubharkar saamne aati he to bijepi bhi use samarthan de sakati he
 On the one hand, it can join the power of UP or strengthen its political ground in UP with its influence by supporting it from outside and also by keeping Congress and SP away from power and not giving them a chance to rise again
 Will try to increase
 vikalp-3: bispi ko sapa-congress kaa baahar se samarthanagar bijepi ko upi main bahumat nahin miltaa he to use satta main aane se rokane ke liye vipakshi dalon kii ekajutata saamne aa sakati he
 To stop the BJP, the sp-congress can support the BSP from outside or by joining the government
 siyasat main sabakuch sambhav he
 Akhilesh Yadav himself has indicated this
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki bijepi ko rokane ke liye bispi ke saath ja sakate hai
 However, the BSP has not opened its cards yet
 upi se sabhi dal is baat par ekajute ho sakate hai ki bijepi ko upi main siyaasi jameen taiyaar karne kaa mauka nahin mil sake
 Option-4: BSP Supports sp-congress If sp-congress alliance has more seats, BSP can support it from outside
 bijepi ko satta se rokane ke liye ye sabhi dal ek saath aa sakate hai
 The BSP may not be involved in the government but it will see many advantages in keeping the BJP away from power in UP
 ek to ye ki satta main apane prabhaav kaa istemaal kar vah 2019 kii chunaav kii taiyaariyon main lag sakati he or pichhali baar ke safaye se ubarne kii koshish karegi
 This will be possible only when the bjp's influence in UP is low and the BSP knows that this is possible only when the BJP is kept away from Lucknow
 vikalp-5: sapa-congress ko chote dalon kaa sathupi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye jis tarah dhur virdohi maane jane vaali samaajawaadee party or congress ne haath mila liya or ab mayawati se kareebi ke sanket mil rahe hai
 In the same way, new equations can emerge after elections
 sapa-congress agar bahumat ke kareeb rahete hai to kai chote dalon ke saath milakar bhi gathbandhan sarkaar ban sakati he
 There are many parties that have influence in their respective areas and can redesign their strategy in the new situation
 jaise areldi, pis party, ovaisi kii party AIMIM aadi
 However, the picture will be clear only when the final results of the election come

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) What the Congress wanted to hear from young Patidar leader Hardik Patel, he finally said
 hardik ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kiye bina hi ‘panje’ ke samarthan kaa elaan kar diya
 Hardik and his representatives were still talking to the Congress in-charge of the party's Gujarat in-charge Ashok Gehlot, senior leader and well-known lawyer Kapil Sibal
 congress ne tay kar rakhaa tha ki hardik pehle ‘deal’ kaa elaan karen, tabhi unki mulaakaat rahul gandhi se karai jaaegi
 Hardik's effort was to get as much from the Congress as possible in the 'deal'
 1 november se hardik kai baar dedline badhaate rahe
 Finally, on November 22, Hardik announced the support of the Congress after all the grievances were overcome
 darasal, congress or hardik patel donon kii koshish rahi ki BJP ko ye kehane kaa mauka naa mili ki hardik congress kii god main khel rahe hai yaa hardik congress ke hi agent the
 That is why, in the normal way or by bowing to Hardik, he was not shown to compromise
 aise main hardik congress ke saamne ‘hard bargening’ vaala rukh apanaate dikhe
 Hardik kept talking about opposition to BJP from the beginning but at the same time he made 5 demands before the Congress for the Patidar community, out of which the Congress accepted 4
 bas aarakshan kaa pechida masalaa rah gaya
 The screw of reservation was stuck on constitutional grounds
 sthiti kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue congress ne samvidhan ke jaankaar or varisht vakil kapil sibbal ko aage kiya
 Kapil Sibal suggested the formula after taking all aspects into consideration
 ise hardik or unki team ne maan bhi liya
 But in spite of all this, the message of 'tension' was continuously given on both sides
 koshish yahi thi ki baahar se yahi dikhe ki hardik apane samudaay ke logon ke hiton ke liye congress se ladaai lard rahe hai or apni sharton par samjhauta karne kii taraf kadam badha rahe hai
 Everyone was interested in knowing what formula Sibal suggested which was agreed by the 'patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti' (PASS) along with Hardik
 ye rahaa wo formula- SC / ST / OBC ke 49 fisadi aarakshan main koi badlaav nahin
 Keeping in mind the Article 31 (c) of the Constitution, the bill will be passed in the Legislative Assembly in the event of the Congress coming to power on the provision of Article 46 of the Constitution
 -jin samudaay kaa anuchhed 46 main zikr he or jinhen samvidhan ke anuchhed 15(4) or 15(6) ke tahat laabh nahi mila, un samudaayon ko shiksha or sarkari naukariyon main samaan nyaay dene ke liye special category banaai jaaegi taaki unhen obisi jaise hi milane vaale tamaam laabh mil saken
 Under this law, a commission will be constituted in consultation with all stakeholders (stakeholders) on behalf of the state government to determine the community to be included in the special category
 iske alaava aarthik rup se pichde logon ko shiksha or aarthik uparjan ke samaan maukon ke liye ayog ke gathan kii baat bhi ek paksh kii ore se kahi gai he
 The things agreed upon will also be included in the Congress manifesto
 congress or hardik kaa ‘hardik talmail’ ho gaya, lekin jaise-jaise isamen pichley kuch hafte se deree ho rahi thi bijepi hardik par adhik hamalavar hoti ja rahi thi
 Meanwhile, Hardik also got an opportunity to know how many Patidar leaders with him would get scattered and join bjp's court
 matdaan se thik pehle aisa hota to hardik ke liye adhik jatke vaali baat hoti
 This is the reason why Hardik continued to follow the policy of 'tel Dekho, Tel Dhar Dekho'
 yahi vajah he ki hardik apane samudaay ke kuch logon kii tikaton ko lekar pench fansaane lage or congress par dabaav banane lage
 Congress finally changed 4 candidates after making the announcement
 hardik yaheen nahin rukeiske baad ek baar phir unhone apni press conference taal di
 After this, Congress changed another candidate
 tab jaakar hardik ne buudhvaar ko press conference main wo elaan kiya jise congress sunanaa chaahati thi
 The effort of the Congress was to create an atmosphere with Hardik's announcement before Rahul Gandhi's visit to Gujarat on November 24, 25
 darasal, congress ne ranneeti ke tahat rahul ko ek yatra main obisi netaa alpesh thakor se, ek main dalit netaa jignesh mewaani se milaayaa
 The possibility of Rahul and Hardik coming together publicly in the next tour cannot be ruled out
 darasal, hardik bijepi ke virodh main itnaa aage aa chuke the kiyaha se mud karakahin or jane kaa unke saamne rasta nahin bachaa tha
 Both Hardik and Congress were well aware that both have an advantage in joining hands with each other
 buudhvaar ko ek duusare kaa haath thaamne kaa aadhikarik elaan bhi ho gaya

 In the whatsapp espionage scandal, the central government may have said that it has no hand in it, but in this case senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal has asked for five years to surround the government
 unhone kaha ki israeli company enesao ne spiware Pegasus ko sirf sarkaron ko bechati he
 Before this, any answer should be given to our government by whatsapp, these questions must be answered
 kapil sibbal ne poocha- sarkaar ke koun se vibhaag ne Pegasus ko kharida, isaki keemat kya he, yah oparation kinake haath main tha, jasusi karne kaa nirdesh kisne diya, or koun se duusare plateform ke saath chhedchhad kii he
 Significantly, many Indians have been informed by whatsapp that they have been spied using the spyware Pegasus of the Israeli company
 watsape ke mutabik is spiware ke jariye 20 deshon ke nagarikon kii jasusi kii gai he
 Israeli NSO sold spyware Pegasus only to Governments Before whatsapp answers our Govt
 must tell us: 1) Which wing of Govt
 purchased Pegasus 2) At what price 3) Who handled it's operations 4) Who gave instructions for snooping 5) Which other platforms are compromised america raashtrapati baraak obama ko karaara jhatka laga he
 The anti-outsourcing bill he is advocating could not be passed in the Senate
 isse bharat ko kaaphi laabh hua he kyonki outsorcing kaa bharat ko kaaphi phayda miltaa he
 Opposition Republican lawmakers opposed the proposal in the Senate and the bill was rejected by a 53–45 vote
 bill ko paarit karaane ke liye kam se kam 60 vot kii zarurat thi
 The US President is a supporter of this bill
 unka maananaa he ki isse america yuvaaon ke liye rojgaar ke avasar khulenge lekin seenet ne ise nakaar diya he
 Elections for the 37 senators of the US Senate are scheduled on 2 November
 raashtrapati baraak obama chunaav prachaar ke dauraan is bill kaa kaaphi samarthan kar rahe hai
 According to him, now outsourcing from America should be controlled, which creates more employment opportunities for the local youth
 unhone chetavanee di thi ki jo companiyaan outsorcing karengin unhen tex main chhot kaa laabh bhi nahin diya jayega
 Many information technology experts in the US and India have expressed opposition to the attitude of the US President on the issue of outsourcing
 america companiyaan bade paimaane par bharat se outsorcing ke jariye kam kharch main apana kaam behatar tareeke se nikaalati hai
 a large number of Indians get jobs from this, but American companies also have a big advantage
 isliye america udyog jagat bhi obama kii is niti ke khilaaf he
 Republican Senator Orin Hatch strongly criticized the Democrats, saying their attitude on outsourcing was completely irresponsible
 isse america arthvyavastha ko or nuksaan pahonchega
 It is not a cure for disease caused to the American economy
 duusare seenetter chuk grassle ne bhi hech kaa samarthan kiya or kaha ki isse rojgaar ke avasar badhane ke bajaae kam hote
 Also, if this bill were passed, it would have caused a lot of damage to American companies
 democrates seenet main bill ke paarit na hone se niraash hai
 According to Harry Reid, a Democratic lawmaker, it is common knowledge that the bill would have greatly benefited the American youth, but it was not because of Republican senators

 uttar pradesh ke gajipur or chandauli jaise maamalon ko aadhaar banaakar vipaksh chunaav ayog par hamalavar he, lekin chunaav ayog ne sabhi aaropon ko niraadhaar bataate hue kaha he ki sabhi EVM kadi suraksha main hai
 In spite of this, political parties have kept their people in safety at the Strong Room i
e
 where the EVM is kept, with complete promptness
 iske alaava partiyaan kai ehtiyaat barat rahi hai or matganana ke liye nirdesh bhi jari kiye hai
 All the evms are kept in the strong room, which is completely under lock and CCTV surveillance, as soon as the Lok Sabha elections are over
 strong room kii suraksha siarpief kar rahi he
 No one is allowed inside the Strong Room
 haalanki, strong room ke saamne parisar main har pratyaashee ko apane agent ko nigaraanee karne kii ijaajat di gai he
 Three agents on one strong room: The Election Commission has allowed one party to have three agents on each strong room
 ye agent ek saath bhi rah sakate hai or chahen to baari-baari se bhi nigaraanee kar sakate hai
 However, the administration there has allowed five people to be monitored on a strong form after being questioned by BSP candidate Afzal Ansari in Ghazipur
 yah vyavastha sirf gajipur ke liye hi he
 Explain that evms of one to three assembly have been kept in a strong room
 yah strong room kii kshamta par nirbhar karata he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the SP-BSP and Congress candidates have appointed their agents on the Strong Room, as well as keeping their ten to twenty people at a distance of about 50 meters outside the Strong Room
 ye log aath-aath ghante ke antaraal par suraksha kar rahe hai
 SP and BSP have issued some guidelines for their candidates for counting
 basapa ne apane pratyaashiyon se kaha ki countig agent ko peethasin adhikari ke dwaara praapt kii gai EVM ko countig ke dauraan khulne se pehle har haal main (EVM, BUCU or VVPAT) number kaa milan karaaen
 Along with this, make sure that the number of green paper seal and special tax used are the same as those mentioned by the Presiding Officer in EVM, BUCU and VVPAT
 aise main donon number sahi paae jane par hi EVM ko khulne kii anumati pradaan kii jaae
 Samajwadi Party has also said the same thing to its candidates
 maharashtra main bhi iviem ko lekar dar kaa maahaul dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Congress candidate from Pune here Mohan Joshi arrived at the counting station on Tuesday and took stock of the situation
 joshi ne bataaya ki congress netaa priyanka gandhi ne chaukanna rahane ke liye kaha he, jiske chalate wo counting stesan pahunche hai
 However, amid all these claims and allegations, the Election Commission has said that evms and vvpats have been kept safe by videography in front of political parties at every counting center
 vahaan sisitivi camere kii bhi vyavastha he
 CRPF is deployed in security, candidates have also been allowed to visit the Strong Room premises
 aise main kisi bhi tarah kaa aarope niraadhaar he
 The people of many high rising societies of Gurugram (gurgaon) coming to the National Capital Region (NCR) are very much disturbed by the arrival of some unwanted 'guests' in their homes these days

 The wildlife department of this area has caught 400 poisonous snakes in the last two months

 We have caught most snakes from areas around Aravalli
 abhi tak july or agast maheene main 400 saanp pakade gaye hai
 This is three times more than last season
 'gauratlab he ki saanp thande rakt vaale hote hai or thand main asahaj mahasoos karte hai
 Hence in northern India, May, June and July are the most suitable for their breeding
 gandas ne kaha, 'pichley 8 se 10 saal main gurugram main barish lagaataar kam hui he
 Due to this, the temperature is increasing and this year the temperature was very high
 yah saanp ke andey sene or uske vikaas ke liye kaaphi upyukt mausam tha
 The situation is quite alarming, as DLF Phase 1, 3, Sector 56, 57, 58 and Kadarpur areas are located in the foothills of the Aravalli hills in Gurugram

 asina krishna pratipada se lekar amavasya tak shraadh kiye jate hai
 From 7 September to 20 September, Pitra Paksha will be there this year
 bhartiya samskruti main shraadh ko ek vishesh darja diya gaya he
 What is Shraadh? Why Shradh? What is the need for Shradh? Consider these questions, then many useful things emerge
 aapako pataa hoga ki shraadh kaa taatpary shraddhabhivyakti parak karm hai jo devatmaon, mahapurushon, rishiyon, gurujanon or pitar purushon kii prasannataa ke liye kiye jate hai
 The annual shraadh is also performed, in which an attempt is made to show devotion, reverential feelings of gratitude to the ancestors of ancestral men
 in sab prayatnon main pitaron kii tripti ke liye unki puja-upasna ke saath vaidic vidhaan se pindadaan ke saath unka tarpan kiya jaataa he
 Objects are just symbols, real devotion is reverence
 vahi pitar, dev, rishi va mahapurushon ko prasann karne ke madhyam banati he
 By the way, whenever Shraddh is performed, it is good
 baarah maheenon ke puure 365 din dev-pitaron ke prati shraddha vyakt kii jaae to or uttam he
 The higher the worship-worship, the better
 dev-pitradi ko jitani adhikadhik shraddha bhaavana samarpit karke prasann kiya jaaye utana uttam
 The Shraddha of the Pitru Paksha is such that if the devotions do not become routine, then the moral right should be done
 asli shraddha to nity dev pujan, pitar pujan, rishi atmaaon kaa pujan or satswarup ishwar araadhan he
 This is the opportunity to get closer to the truth as much as possible
 hamen is adhikadhik shraddha samarpan ke liye prayatnsheel hona chahie
 a Mahanubhavi has rhymed well agar ho sake to unako saans-saans main basaaya jaae
 No need to blink, eyes should be seen closed
 idhar dhundha na udhar dhundha, abhi yaheen bas darasa jaae
 It should not be there, it is just us, we should be defeated
 shraddha yadi is had tak pahunch jaae to samajhnaa chahie shraadh sarthak ho gaya
 If reverence touches the truth, then it should be understood that Shraddha is blessed
 varsh main ek baar shraadh kiya to kya kiya? shraddharpan har vakt, har pal, har kshan hona chahie
 The greater the blessings of God, the man, the divine and the power of God, the more unfortunate we are
 shraadh ke saath-saath ek or baat bhi karne yogya he
 We wish God or fatherly men good luck
 sukh saubhaahgya keval ishwar se nahin milte
 He also has this elaborate nature composed by him, which is composed of five elements
 in bhuton main dharti hamaare sabase nikat he, bas-vaas or khan-paan kaa aadhaar he
 In this, not only grain water, tree vegetation also helps in our living and healthy
 Ganesh Chaturthi 2017: jaaniye kab he ganpati visarjan kaa shubh muhoort or kya he iskaa mahatvatippaniyanshbhakr Eid 2017: in miseges se kahen bakreed mubarak, whatsapp-facebook par bhejein ye sandesh All of us are protected and nourished by the oxygen released from the vegetation
 is drushti se hamaara bhi kartavya banataa he ki vriksh vanaspatiyon kii kami na aae, isliye vriksharopan karte rahanaa chahie
 Although the people living in forest areas may find its utility less useful, but go to the desert and see what is the importance of trees
 jab tapati ret kii asay ooshmaa se jaan nikal rahi hoti he, tabhi hari-bhari dharti ke sushital anchal kii mahatta samaj main aati he
 That is why the order of planting trees should also be done along with Shradh
 jis tarah pitar hamaare paalak poshak hai, usee tarah vriksh bhi hamaare jivan rakshak hai
 Without them, happiness cannot be a possibility of any kind
 to aaie, shraadh ke avasar par ham ek taraf pitaron, dev atmaaon or rishi atmaaon ko shraddha arpit karen to duusari taraf ek-ek paudha bhi dharti kii godi main ropit karte jaaen
 There will be greenery, only then we will stay and we will get the opportunity to perform the shraddhavi-shraddha deeds that bring us closer to the truth
 agar ho sake to unako saans-saans main basaaya jaae
 No need to blink, eyes should be seen closed
 idhar dhundha na udhar dhundha, abhi yaheen bas darasa jaae
 May it not be there, just we will be Harsa Jaaye॥ Bakra Eid 2017: Say these messages to Bakrid Mubarak, send this message on whatsapp-facebook tivi ke femes serial 'cid'main ab tak aapane dayaa ke stants ko dekha he
 But now cid's team will have another personality entry, 'lady Daya'

 mumbai se sate palghar jile main jangal ke bich pahaad par bane ashram ko lekar pichley ek hafte se chal rahaa tanaav aakhirkaar shant hota dikh rahaa he
 The Supreme Court has removed the displeasure of the devotees by prohibiting the breaking of the temple, hut and mausoleum at Balayogi Sadanand Baba Ashram
 prashasan ne bhi raahat kii saans lee he
 This Balayogi Shri Sadanand Baba Ashram dispute, built at a height of 2 thousand feet above sea level, now seems to be calming
 uttarapradesh ke purv rajyapal ram nik or mandir kii arji par sarvocch nyaayalay ne ashram main bane is mandir, balyogi sadanand baba kii kutiyaa or unke mata - pita kii samadhi ko abhaydaan de diya he
 But all other constructions adjacent to it will be broken
 mumbai se sate palghar main van vibhaag kii jameen par bana hone kii vajah se balyogi sadanand mandir kaa parisar surkhiyon main aayaa
 Environmentalists say that the temple is built on the land of the forest department and due to which the wildlife of the place is affected, it should be destroyed
 isaki shikaayat 2004 main kii gai thi maamla supreme court tak panhucha or ab supreme court ne ise 31 agast tak todane kaa aadesh diya he
 According to the order, when a part of the Ashram's Dharamshala was being demolished amid heavy police arrangements, it fell on the JCB itself
 ganimat rahi ki jesibi chaalak ko gambhir chot nahin ai
 But on the third day of the breaking act, devotees of Baba kept protesting at different places in Palghar district
 rasta roko bhi kiya
 So the general public got in trouble
 puure jile main is dauraan kadaa police bandobast rahaa taaki kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti bani rahe
 Balayogi Sri Sadanand Baba Ashram, built near Parasuram Kund on the hill, is 50 years old
 baba balyogi ne 12 saal kii umr se hi yahaan sadhana karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Baba's number of devotees increased with his devotion and social work
 aaj ashram paune do acre main failaa he or yahaan asaadhya rogon ke ilaaj kaa bhi daawa kiya jaataa he
 However, now only worship can be done in the temple here because the demolition of the Pharmacy building and Prasad Ghar and the sabhamandap will stop the service
 team india or srilanka ke bich paanch maichon kii vanade siries kaa chauthaa match aaj dopaher 2:30 baje se arpies stadium colombo main khelaa jayega
 The Indian team, which has already taken an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series, will take on Sri Lanka in the fourth match of the series today with the intention of retaining the winning momentum
 dambula or pallecol main jis tarah team india ne pradarshan kiya he, use dekhakar lagata he ki chauthe vanade main use jeet se rokna aasaan nahin hoga
 Dhoni will play in the 300th ODI against Sri Lanka, with the intention of registering their fourth consecutive win today
 is match main sabhi kii nazren purv bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni par lagi hogi jo apana 300waan vanade match khelenge
 In such a situation, Dhoni is likely to make this match memorable by playing a great innings in this match
 srilanka ke khilaaf vanade siries main ab tak khele gaye 3 match team india ke jite hai
 For India, more than one of the world's best finishers Mahendra Singh Dhoni has played only ODI Sachin Tendulkar 463, Rahul Dravid 344, Mohammad Azharuddin 334, Sourav Ganguly 311 and Yuvraj Singh 304
 team indiyabharat ke paas viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan, rohit sharma or mahendra singh dhoni jaise ballebaajon ke saath jasprit bumraah or bhubaneshwar jaise gendbaaj hai
 Who have performed brilliantly so far
 iske alaava pichley teen vanade main keel rahul khaas prabhavit nahin kar paae hai
 In such a situation, it can be expected that Manish Pandey can be included in the last 11 in the fourth ODI
 aapako bataa den ki match se manish pandey ko net par jamkar pasinaa bahaate hue dekha gaya he
 Talking about bowling, Jasprit Bumrah remains in awe for the entire Sri Lankan team
 pichley teen vanade main ve 11 wicket le chuke hai
 Team India has already captured the series
 aise main coach ravi shastri or kohli is match main bench par baithe khilaadiyon ko mauka de sakate hai
 So far Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, Kuldeep Yadav and Shardul Thakur have not got a chance to play a single match
 aise main kedaar jadhav or lokesh rahul ko baitha kar rahane yaa pandey ko mauka mil saktaa he
 Akshar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal have performed average so far in the spin
 kohli inamen se kisi ek ko baahar rakh kar chinamen kuldeep ko utaar sakate hai
 Sri Lankan Sri Lanka is in danger of not qualifying directly in the World Cup 2019
 bharat ke khilaaf vanade siries shuru hone se pehle srilanka kii team isisi team ranking main 88 ank ke saath aathven sthaan par bani hui he
 30 September 2017 is the last date to qualify for the World Cup and Sri Lanka and West Indies will be face to face as the 8th team
 ab aise main srilanka ko bharat ke khilaaf bache hue donon match har haal main jeetne honge
 If the Sri Lankan team wins both the remaining matches against India, it will qualify for the World Cup 2019 straight away with 90 points
 iske alaava srilanka ke niyamit captain upul tharanga par do maichon ke pratibandh ke baad tisare match main team kii kaman sanbhaalane vaale chamaara kapugedara bhi chauthe vanade main nahin khel paaenge
 He has been ruled out of the match due to backache

 If this happens, the role of his wife and Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav will be very important in the election campaign
 raajnneeti main paryaapt anubhav hasil kar chuki hai dimpalakannauj se loksabhaa saansad dimple yadav isi maheene kii 15 taarikh ko 39 saal kii ho jaaengi
 It has been 17 years since his marriage to Akhilesh Yadav
 raajnneeti main unki entry 2009 main tab hui jab pati akhilesh yadav dwaara chodi gai firozabad seat par samaajawaadee party ne unhen pratyaashee banaakar utaara
 Although Dimple lost these important elections, after three years, when Akhilesh also left the Kannauj seat to contest the assembly elections in 2012, Dimple was able to win unopposed from there
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab puure upi main modi kii aandhi main vipaksh kaa vot bank uda ja rahaa tha tab bhi dimple kannauj kii apni seat bachaane main kaamyaab raheen
 He defeated bjp's Subrata Pathak by a margin of about 20 thousand votes

 The activists are already chanting slogans like 'development Key - Dimple Bhabhi'
 dimple yadav pehle bhi chunaav prachaar kaa kaam dekhati rahi hai
 But so far she has been seen more in the role of the daughter-in-law of the family
 chunki is baar akhilesh kaa chunaav prachaar van main sho zyada rahane vaala he, aise main dimple yadav par hi jimmedaari hogi ki jahaan akhilesh nahin ja paaenge, vahaan ve party ke paksh main chunavi sabhaayen karen
 Dimple Dimple is expected to play a role like Priyanka for SP, she is said to be doing the same work for Samajwadi Party across the state that Priyanka Gandhi has been doing for the Congress in Rae Bareli and Amethi
 dimple ke saath khaas baat ye he ki ve priyanka kii tarah raajnneeti se baahar nahin hai balki sapa main puri tarah se sakriy hai
 She also has a good experience of contesting elections and has made her public speaking many times on issues related to women
 priyanka-dimple kii saath-saath raily gemeanger sabit ho sakati hedgar akhilesh yadav sapa par haaavee rahete hai to congress ke saath unka gathbandhan tay mana ja rahaa he
 Congress is continuously indicating that this time Priyanka's role in the elections will be more extensive than before
 agar aisa hua to dimple or priyanka saath raily kar sakate hai
 The mobilization of the two on one platform will be such an important bet in terms of mobilization, which will be very difficult for the opposition BJP and BSP to find the cut

 ' uafo or alian hamaare or aapke liye jitani badi paheli hai, china ke liye utana hi bada sirdard
 a mysterious ufo-like figure appeared near an airport in China last week
 isaki vajah se ek ghante tak airport band rahaa
 Similarly, in July too, ufo-like mysterious figure was seen near an airport in China
 pehle 7 july ko china ke hangjhau airport ke paas dikhi rahasyamay roshni or ab 11 sitambar ko inner mongolia praant ke baotu airport se 40 kilometre purv kii taraf waisi hi chamakili roshni dikhi or iske baad airport ko ek ghante ke liye band karnaa padaa
 This time the danger was even greater because this time there was also a risk of collision with that mysterious light
 baotu airport ke ek adhikari luo ke mutabik hamen hahot air trephic management beuro se uafo ke bare main notice mila
 We immediately started sending planes to another airport to avoid any mishap
 agar aisa nahin karte to badi takkar ho sakati thi
 That night, about three o'clock at nine o'clock, three planes reaching Baotu from Beijing and Shanghai kept circling in the sky for a long time
 aakhirkaar beijing se baotu aane vaali air china flite 1107 ko erados airport par utaara gaya, jabaki duusare vimaan junauyao ko taiyuvan airport par
 There was no accident at Baotu Airport that night, but that mysterious light has certainly raised some questions
 pehla sawaal yah uthaa ki kya inner mongolia ke aasmaan main wo koi uafo tha
 Has UFO started circling the skies of China and Mongolia in the last nine months
 doosraa sawaal yah uthta he ki kahin ye chini fouj kaa koi nayaa prayog to nahin he
 It is being speculated that the Chinese army may have done some experiment in the sky during the night, which resulted in the appearance of UFO
 teesraa sawaal yah uthta he ki kahin yah koi takneekee khilwaad to nahin
 It may be that Chinese scientists have tried to produce rings in the sky on the lines of Russian scientists
 khabaron ke mutabik aisa hi prayog kuch dinon pehle rusi sena ke ejiniyaron ne norway ke aasmaan main kiya tha or america sena ne australia main
 Recently, a similar mysterious light was seen in the skies of Romania, after investigating it, scientists believed that it is a glow of long lasting electricity
 china ke baotu airport par jis tarah se ghante bhar tak vimaan kii udaanen thap rahi, usee tarah do maheene pehle hangjhau shahar main bhi ek rahasyamay akruti ne airport par chakkaa jam kar diya tha
 On July 7 at 9 pm, people were returning to their homes in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang in China's eastern province, to see something in the sky that surprised everyone
 sadakon par gadiyon kii awajahi thap ho gai
 There was chaos at Xiaoshan Airport in Hangzhou City
 air trephic ko rokna pad gaya
 In the dark of night, people saw a mysterious and strange figure in the sky, from which bright light was coming out from every corner
 is akruti kaa aakaar bhi kaaphi bada tha
 Everything that people had seen in Hollywood movies till now was present before their eyes
 haalanki abhi tak is rahasyamayi akruti ke bare main koi khulaasa nahin hua or ab to inner mongolia ke baotu airport ke paas bhi rahasyamay akruti kii baat saamne aa gayi he
 In such a situation, the mystery of ufos has deepened
 jis vakt yah rahasyamay akruti dikhi, us samay ziyaaoshaan airport ko ek ghante ke liye band kar diya gaya
 By then all flights were diverted to the nearby cities of Ningbo and Wuzi
 china main uafo yaa rahasyamayi akruti dikhne kii ghatana bahut kam hoti thi
 But within one year three such incidents have taken place
 tabhi to in aasamaani ajoobon ke bare main yah sugabugahat tej ho gayi he ki kya ye uafo he yaa phir kuch or aisa nahin he ki sirf china main hi uafo or alian kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 a short time ago, a mysterious ring of clouds appeared in the sky of Romania
 tab us challe ko dekhakar vahaan ke log dar gayi the lekin vaigyanikon ne paaya ki ve kisi duusare grah ke jeev nahin hai, balki kudarat kaa ek najaara he
 The incident is in October 2009
 is haroonges kudarti tasviir se log hairaan the
 Speculations intensified
 uafo ko lekar baton kaa bazaar itnaa garm hua ki logon ne yahaan tak kahana shuru kar diya tha ki duusari duniya ke logon ne dharti par hamale kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 This figure came to be considered as proof of his
 vaigyanikon ne is akruti ko dekh kar shuru main hi daawa kiya tha ki yah prakruti main badlaav kaa ek namoona bhar he
 But he was not letting them believe that he was sitting inside the people
 halaki chand ghanton main vaigyanikon kii baat sahi sabit hui
 After a few days of research, the scientists made it clear that this sky sky was a game of nature
 unke mutabik badalon kii is akruti ko folstric kaha jaataa he
 It is formed only when the moisture content in the air does not change into snow, despite going below zero
 hawa main maujuud nami kaa vah behad thanda hissaa badalon ke challe main badal jaataa he
 Then he stops at some height from the surface of the earth
 aisi akruti jyadatar tab banati he jab suraj doobane vaala hota he
 There is no corner of the world where there is no mysterious story of aliens and ufos
 lekin ye sawaal to saalon se bana hua he ki kya vaaki hote hai alian
 Well-known scientist Stephen Hawking further heated up the debate by saying that Alien existed
 is sawaal par atakalon kaa bazaar aksar garm hota he lekin uafo aaj bhi bhuton kii tarah hi ek paheli he
 Most scientists believe that there can be life on other planets in the universe
 lekin pichley dinon britain ke jane-maane vaigyanik stephen hawking ne yah kahkar logon ko chaunkaa diya ki alian kaa naa sirf vajood he balki wo insaanon se zyada taqatvar hai or dharti par hamalaa kar sakate hai
 So one should not try to contact them
 hawking kii baat agar sahi he to bhi ye sawaal uthta he ki alian baar baar dhanti par kyon aate hai? in sawaalon kaa jawaab to ab tak kisi vaigyanik ke paas nahin he
 But to solve the mystery of aliens and ufos, these questions need to be answered

 When the Star Plus show Sanjeevani 2 started, there was a lot of buzz about the serial
 12 agast ko sho launch hua tha
 There was a lot of buzz on social media about the show but in TRP ratings, the show failed to perform well
 ab khabaren hai ki sho jald hi band hone vaala he
 According to an entertainment portal report, Sanjeevani 2 is going to close soon

 He said - no, there is no truth in these reports 
 sho band hone nahin ja rahaa he or naa hi mujhe aisi koi report nahin mili he ki sho ko kam tiarapy mil rahi he
 Before the start of the show, Sanjeevani 2 producer Siddharth had talked about how the show will be completely different from Sanjeevani 2, the serial Sanjeevani and Dil Dil Mil Gaye
 unhone kaha, 'sanjivani or dil mil gaye interns kii kahani par focus karata tha
 In this show you will see the story of resident doctors
 doctors hospital main surgery kar sakate hai jabaki interns nahin kar sakate
 'mohnish Behl, Gurdeep Kohli, Surabhi Chandna, Namit Khanna and Sayantani Ghosh are appearing in the show
 sharad yadav ko bhartiya janata party kii aguwai vaali rashtriya loktantric gathbandhan kaa sanyojak banaaya gaya he
 Regarding the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Sharad Yadav said that the problems of the farmers, corruption and unemployment will be the main issues of the NDA
 yah puche jane par ki shekhavat ke maamle main sanghathan kya kar rahi he
 Yadav said that this is an internal matter of the BJP

 BJP is trying to solve it but BJP is not a party like ours
 bhaajapa ek sanghathan ke centre main chalane vaali party nahin he ki koi bhi baahar kaa ise nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he
 And what you are saying about now, they do not have the power to do harm to the BJP
 india today se khaas baat karte hue yadav ne kaha ki endie aane vaale chunaavon ko dekhte hue kai partiyon ke sampark main he
 We have joined the Indian National Lok Dal, which was not with us for many years
 ham andhra pradesh or tamilnadu main bhi kai anya partiyon se baat kar rahe hai
 The Sri Lankan team has defeated Dhobi by defeating Team India by 9 wickets in the second ODI
 pehle srilankai team ne team india ko 138 ranon par samet diya or phir iske ballebaajon ne bhi koi kasar nahin choda
 When Sri Lanka won, at that time they had 181 balls in their innings
 bachi hui gendon ke maamle main yah bharat kii duusari sabase badi haar he
 The biggest defeat was in 2010 against Sri Lanka in Dambulla
 us match main jab bharat haara tha to 209 genden phenki jaani bachi thim
 Openers Upul Tharanga and Tillakaratne Dilshan batted closely and completed half-centuries

 The only wicket of Sri Lanka's innings fell in the form of Dilshan (50) which Ashwin got caught by Dhoni
 upul tharanga ant tak out nahin hue or 60 gendon par 59 ranon kii pari kheli
 Earlier, Team India has presented an embarrassing batting sample in Hambantota ODI
 pehle ekadivasiy main 300 ranon se upar banane vaali bhartiya team keval 138 ran bana saki
 The last Indian player to be dismissed was Gautam Gambhir, who scored 65 runs for India
 ek chor se lagaataar wicket girte rahe to duusari chor se bhartiya pari kii shuruyaat karne vaale salaami ballebaaj gautam gambhir jame rahe
 Gambhir hit a half-century and was dismissed as the last player
 bharat ne toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla kiya lekin sahvaag ke out hone ke baad yah faisla galat dikhne laga
 By the time Sehwag was dismissed, the team was averaging 8 runs per over
 lekin sahvaag ke out hone ke baad ballebaajon main ‘tu chal main aayaa’ kii tarj par out hone kii hode lag gai
 Sehwag scored the same number of runs in 15 balls
 out hone vaale duusare khilaadi pehle match ke shatakaveer viraat kohli the
 Virat Kohli scored only 1 run
 viraat ke out hone ke baad team ne abhi keval 5 ran hi jode the ki rohit sharma bina khaataa khole out ho gaye

 For Sri Lanka, Perera and Mathews took 3-3 wickets, while Malinga took two and Herath took one wicket
 shanivaar ko khele gaye mukaable main bharat ne mejabaan team ko 21 ranon se parajeet kar paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 1-0 kii badhat banaai thi

 We all live in a society surrounded by media
 aam jivan main tamaam muddon ke saath saath media bhi ek mudda rahata hi he
 Not only you, we are also constantly trying to understand this media
 rashtrawaad se lekar rasinic khaad ke saath-saath media ko lekar bhi tamaam manchon par bahasein hoti rahati hai
 Media remains an issue for you too
 media ke liye bhi aap ek mudda hai
 You may not have as much opinion as you think about the media
 media kii swatantraaa ko lekar duniya bhar main chintaa jataai ja rahi he, saath hi saath media kaa prasar bhi usee raftaar se ho rahaa he
 If you look at all the standards, the freedom of press is decreasing, while the business of press is increasing rapidly
 ye mujhe samaj nahin aata he ki jab press azaad hi nahin he to media ke nae-nae madhyamon kaa varchasv kaise badhata ja rahaa he
 Do we or you not value the freedom of media? vishwa press swatantraaa diwas par twit to vaise hi ho rahe hai jaise diwaali or ramanavami par hote hai, isiilie laga ki is tyohaar ko aapke saath manaata hum
 What a deep impression the British and American media have on the minds of us Indians
 sienen or bibisi ke alaava neuyark times main agar pradhanmantri modi kii aalochana chap jaae to virdohi ummid baandh lete hai ki chunaav haarenge
 If praises are published, his supporters are happy that the name of the Prime Minister is being known all over the world
 kya aap jaanate hai ki unke apane desh main media ko lekar kis tarah kii bahes ho rahi he
 Countries with institutions such as the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, BBC, Times, Economist, USA and UK have lost their freedom of press
 reporters vidout borders kii reating main america 2016 main 41wein number par tha jo ab do ank girakar 43 par aa gaya or britain jo 2016 main 38wein number par tha ab girakar 40wein number par aa gaya he
 In these countries, the institutions of democracy are considered very strong, then why the freedom of media is declining here
 america ke raashtrapati to chunaav ladane ke samay se apane mulk kii media ko khulkar gariyaate hai
 They give language like abuse
 haal hi main jab unki sarkaar ne 100 din puure kiye to trump white house kii reporting karne vaale samvaadadaataaon ke raatri bhoj main nahin gaye
 Usually the President goes to such a feast
 trump washington se dur pencilvenia chale gaye or vahaan samarthakon ke bich media ko jamkar nishaanaa banaaya
 He said that if media work is to show honesty and truth, then on this scale it should get zero
 ve chunaav ke samay se hi media ko phek news kehete rahe hai
 There is still so much left in America that Minhaz fiercely quipped at the trump at the journalists' banquet and said that the trump is the master of lies
 minhaz sahab ne to ab raashtrapati ko lair in chif yani jhuuthon kaa sartaaj kaha he
 In our place, Bharat Vyas ji wrote a song in 1957 for Two Eyes Twelve Hands which became very famous
 sainyaa jhuuthon kaa bada sartaaj niklaa
 In every country there is a conflict between the press and the president or between the press and the prime minister
 turki ke raashtrapati bharat aae the or yahaan chaatro ko sandesh dekar gaye ki pashchimi media par bharosa na karen
 He does not show the truth
 aap turki ke channel dekhiye
 The comments Vidour Borders has made about the freedom of the press in Turkey may not be known to the students listening in Jamia's auditorium
 isaki report main turki ko lekar sabase adhik chintaa jataai gai he
 Turkey ranks 155th out of 180 countries
 2016 kii tulana main chaar ank neeche gira he
 It has dropped 57 points in 12 years
 july 2016 main vahaan takhtapalat kii koshishen huin thim
 After that, the government only opened a front against the press
 kai media sansthaanon par pratibandh laga diye gaye
 More than 100 journalists were sent to jail without trial
 kahin se bhi media ko lekar acchhee khabar nahin he
 Why is this happening, does the public not want independent media, is the desire for independent media limited to only a few people
 media kaa kaarobaar kaaphi tezi se bad rahaa he
 In the world as well as in India
 lekin kya aapke jeene kii paristhitiyaan pehle se behatar hui hai, kya aapako lagata he ki raajnneeti main javabdehi aa gai he, yaa sabakuch dharna hi he, jaisaa chal rahaa tha vaisaa hi chal rahaa he
 Why do people trust this media, whose freedom, fairness are being questioned all over the world
 in sab utaar-chadhaav ke bich pakistan 2016 kii tulana main 8 ank behatar ho gaya
 In 2016, Pakistan was ranked 147, but in 2017, it was ranked at 139
 2016 main bharat 133 number par tha jo teen ank girakar 2017 main 136 par aa gaya
 Some comments can be seen in the report by Reporters Without Borders, which has produced indexes of press freedom in the world
 is sanstha ke secretary general Christophe Deloire kaa kahana he ki loktantron main jis dar se pratibandh badhate ja rahe hai wo kaafii chintaa kii baat he or agar media kii azaadi surakshit nahin he to kisi duusari azaadi kii guarantee nahin di ja sakati
 Where will this downward spiral take us? That is, where are we going to reach by falling
 jahaan bhi authoritarian strongman model kii jeet hui he, vahaan media kii azaadi ghati he
 Public radio and TV stations have become propaganda tools in such places
 jaise poland, hungary, tanzania vagairah
 The country has become the largest prison for media professionals in the world since the failed rebellion against the Rajab Tayyib Ardogan government in Turkey (155)
 vahaan ek ekadhikaaravaadi, swechhachari sarkaar satta main he
 Putin's Russia (148) is also not far from these situations
 hamane bharat ke kuch patrakaron se unki raay mangai
 Asked him if he believed that the press in India was free
 kya unhen lagata he ki patrakarita main aane ke baad vahi kaam kar rahe hai jiske liye aae the, kya ab ve pehle se zyaada gambhirtha se sochate hai ki mauka miltaa to is madhyam ko chhod dete
 Have you ever thought that if the press starts speaking the language of the crowd, the language of the government then what will be your loss
 aap koshish karenge to bahut aasaani se samaj aa jayega
 a work is being done very cleverly in India
 rashtrawaad kii aad main patrakarita apni chamachagiri chipa rahi he
 If the work of a journalist is to question, then tomorrow you will see how those who question are mocked
 loktantr ke liye jitna media kii swatantraaa zaruri he utana hi vipaksh kii maujuudagi bhi
 Opposition is ridiculed on the day of India's journalism
 unki gheraabandi is tarah se ho rahi he jaise wo vipaksh main nahin, sarkaar main ho
 The press has additionally become aggressive against the opposition
 ye sab aap khud bhi notice kar sakate hai
 President Obama said one thing to the press when he left his post, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
" " matlab patrkaar kaa kaam chamachaa hona nahin he, uskaa kaam sawaal karnaa he
 This is said by the President of the country in which the country has got a lot of press rights under the First Amendment
 obama ne aath saal ke kaarykaal main 165 press conference kii thi
 Every year he held 20 press conferences
 kya bharat main kisi raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri yaa kisi mukhyamantri ke bare main aap jaanate hai jo saal main 20 press conference karte hon, jahaan khulkar sawaal jawaab hote hon
 i am not paying attention
 raashtrapati trump press kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Instead of going among them, they go out among their supporters and attack the press
 is tarah se logon ko bhi press ke khilaaf bhida de rahe hai
 This is happening duniya bhar main taqatvar netaa chaalaaki se logon ko press ke khilaaf bhadkaa rahe hai
 Here friends of ours also advise that leave journalism worry, do not confront anyone more
 desh chalata rahegaa
 But American journalists together wrote a long letter to President Trump
 is par bhi hamane prime time main charchaa kii thi
 Even then, it was said that if the newspaper is printed on the front page of Hindi, Bangla and Marathi to Tamil, Telugu newspapers, then there will be a change in readers before journalists
 wo press ke kaam ko paini nazar se dekhne lagenge
 The American Press Corps is a large organization of American journalists whose center is located in New York's Columbia University
 har tarah ke news sanghathan or vichaardhaara ke patrkaar hai
 Respected elected President, aapke kaarykaal ke shuru hone ke antim dinon main hamane abhi hi saaf kar dena sahi samajha ki ham aapke prashasan or amareeki press ke rishton ko kaise dekhte hai
 We believe that there is tension in their relationship
 report bataati he ki aapke press sachiv white house se media ke daftaron ko band karne kii soch rahe hai
 You have banned many news organizations from covering themselves
 aapane twitor par naam lekar patrakaron par taane kase hai, dhamkaaya he
 Has asked his supporters to do the same
 aapane ek reporter kaa yah kahkar mazaaq udaaya he ki uski baaten isliye acchhee nahin lagi ki vah viklang he
 They will make a mistake by ending the reporter's access to their administration
 ham soochna hasil karne ke tarah tarah ke raste khojane main maahir hai
 Many of the news organizations that you banned during your campaign have been excellent
 ham is chunauti ko sweekaar karte hai
 Journalism rules are ours, not yours
 ham chaahe to aapke adhikariyon se aaf ricard baat karen yaa na karen
 If we wish, do not attend the record briefing
 agar aap yah sochate hai ki reporter ko chup kara dene yaa bhaga dene se story nahin milegi to galat hai
 We will try to take your side
 lekin ham sachai ko todane marodane waalon ko jagah nahin denge
 Whenever they do this, we will drive them away
 yah hamaara adhikaar he
 We will not repeat your lie
 aapaki baat chhaapenge lekin sachai kaa pataa karenge
 You and your staff sit in the White House, but the US government is quite wide
 ham sarkaar ke chaaron taraf apane reporter tainaat kar denge
 They will get into your agencies and bring news from bureaucrats
 ho saktaa he ki aap apane prashasnic imaarat se aane vaali khabaron ko roak len lekin ham aapaki nitiyon kii samiksha karke dikhaa denge
 If someone writes such a letter in India, the leader will do one thing
 aajkal raajnneetik dalon ke samarthakon ne bahut sari website khol rakhi he
 Everyone has a Twitter account
 unke zariye us patrkaar yaa media santhaan par jo hamalaa hoga ki log bhi usee ke khilaaf khadey hone lagenge
 They will feel that supporting their leader means opposing the media questioning him
 is chakkar main nuksaan kiskaa hota he
 Belongs to you
 america ke patrakaron ne to trump kii chunauti sweekaar kii, lekin uske bahut pehle se duniya bhar ke patrkaar ghotalebaz or jhuthe netaaon ke peeche pade hai
 Remind you of the Panama Papers that were continuously raided by the Indian Express for several days
 germany ke dakshini hisse main ek shahar he munich
 From here comes a newspaper called Jude Daeche Tsiteung
 german main jud kaa matlab hota he dakshin, doyche matlab germany or tcitung matlab akhbaar
 South Germany has a large newspaper of circulation whose circulation is 4 lakh 32 thousand
 duusare vishwayuddh ke baad shuru hue jud doyche tcitung yah akhbaar kaaphi lokapriy he
 This newspaper gets more than one crore emails and PDF files of 2 lakh shell companies i

 fake companies associated with Mossack Fonseca, a Panama city company
 aarope he ki 1977 main bani is company ne kai farzi companiyon ko bikwane kaa khel khelaa he jiske zariye duniya ke bade logon ne apana paisa apni sarkaar se chipa kar panama main jamaa karaayaa he taaki tex na inhen dastavezon ko panama papers naam diya gaya he
 It was not easy to read millions of company and millions of documents
 wo bhi tab jab inaki jaanch ke liye duniya ke kai deshon main padtaal zaruri thi
 Therefore, the Jude Deutsche Tsiteung newspaper shared these documents with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar ek saal tak in dastavezon kii jaanch karte rahe
 The group also includes Indian Express from India whose Panama Papers have been printed in great detail in its website and newspaper
 ICIJ 76 deshon ke duniya bhar ke 109 sansthaanon ke khoji patrakaron kaa ek samooh he
 Crime, corruption is no longer confined to the border of one country, becomes the case of many countries, so it is important that journalists of many countries work together
 ICIJ main kai prakaar ke anbhavi log kaam karte hai khaskar ve log jo sarkari ricard ko padhane main daksh hote hai
 There are also fact checkers and lawyers
 bharat main aisa kai patrkaar apane str par kar rahe hai
 There are many websites that are becoming an alternative to journalism but they do not have as much reach as the media or social media controlled by political parties
 phek news ek chunauti to he hi
 Journalists are also presenting fake news and governments are also throwing news
 phek news matlab news ke naam par nakli news
 As soon as elections begin in India, the Election Commission starts to face the challenge of paid news
 paisa dekar yaa kisi or tareeke se vigyaapan dekar raajnneetik dalon ke haq main lahar paidaa kii ja rahi he
 Paid news is now a chronic problem
 ek or news he slo news
 The concept has been given by the BBC Director General Tony Hall
 tony haul kaa maananaa he ki ham sara internet to sampadit nahin kar sakate magar kinare bhi nahin baith sakate
 For this, an intelligence unit is being created within the BBC which will fact-check all fake news and expose it
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar phek news raajnneetik sanghathanon or unke samarthakon dwaara hi failaaye ja rahe hai
 Media is also no less in making fake news
 bibisi ne is chunauti ko abhiyaan ke taur par sweekaar kiya he
 Facebook has also announced to form a team to investigate fake news
 bibisi kii yah baat dilachasp he ki hamen slo news kii zarurat he
 Which has depth, data, search, analysis and expertise

 Whereas the army said clearly the next day that no such incident had taken place

 a mistake also occurred to me in Tuesday's prime time
 us galati main do galati hui
 Many newspapers published the news that 100 grams of curd has been purchased in the railway for Rs 972
 yah soochna aar tii ai se mili he
 When the Railways investigated, it was found that the officials gave incorrect information in RTI

 We showed this news but till then i did not know about the railway's response
 phir ye galati he
 Railway officials gave wrong information to RTI, it appeared in RTI newspapers and from there in prime time
 hamane duusari galati ye ki 972 rupee ko 9,720 rupee likh diya
 i have no hesitation in apologizing for such a mistake
 lekin ye phek news nahin he
 Fake news is that which is being circulated among you in many ways these days

 Journalists went to the rugged and interviewed the dacoits as well as the mafia and gangsters
 khabaron ko nikaalane main patrkaar kai tarah ke jokhim uthaate hai
 Governments have started curbing journalists in the name of terrorism
 britain main ek kanoon paas hua he the Investigative Powers Act, ise snupar charter bhi kehete hai

 pakistan ke don akhbaar ke patrkaar siril alamida ne is saal 9 janvari ko ek khabar brake kii jisamen kaha gaya ki pakistan kii sarkaar ne apane faujee netritv ko saafe kah diya he ki agar aatankwaad ke kilaaf thos karrwai nahin kii gai to pakistan ke antarrashtriya birdari main alag thalag padane kaa khatara he
 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is

 12 saal main yah 57 ank neeche gira he
 There were coup attempts in July 2016
 uske baad to sarkaar ne press ke khilaaf morcha hi khol diya
 Many media institutions were banned
 bina trial ke 100 se adhik patrakaron ko jail bhej diya gaya
 There is no good news about media from anywhere
 aisa kyon ho rahaa he, kya janata ko swatantra media nahin chahie, kya swatantra media kii chaah sirf kuch logon tak hi simit he
 The media business is growing very fast
 duniya main bhi or bharat main bhi
 But have your living conditions been better than before, do you think that accountability has come in politics, or everything is just perception, it is going on as it was
 logon kaa bharosa isi media par kyon he jisaki swatantraaa, nishpakshta ko lekar duniya bhar main sawaal uth rahe hai
 In the midst of all these ups and downs, Pakistan gained 8 points better than in 2016
 2016 main pakistan 147ve number par tha, lekin 2017 main 139 wein number par aa gaya
 India was ranked 133 in 2016, falling three points to 136 in 2017
 reporters vidout borders, jisane duniya main press kii swatantraaa ke suchakank taiyaar kiye hai, unki report main kuch tippaniyan dekhi ja sakati hai
 Christophe Deloire, the secretary general of this institution, says that the rate at which the restrictions are increasing in democracies is a matter of great concern and that no other freedom can be guaranteed if media freedom is not protected
 ye downward spiral, hamen kahaan le jayega? yani ham girte girte kahaan pahunchane vaale hai
 Wherever the authoritarian strongman model has won, the freedom of media has decreased
 aisi jagahon par public radio or tivi stesan propaganda ke auzaar ban gaye hai
 Such as Poland, Hungary, Tanzania, etc
 turki (155) main rajab taiyab ardogaan sarkaar ke kilaaf naakaam baghawat ke baad se wo desh duniya main media profeshnals ke liye sabase badi jail sa ban gaya he
 There is a monopolistic, autocratic government in power
 putin kaa rus (148) bhi in halaat se bahut dur nahin he
 We asked for their opinion from some journalists in India
 unase poocha ki kya ve maanate hai ki bharat main press azaad he
 Do they think that after coming into journalism, they are doing the same work for which they had come, now do they think more seriously than before that if they had the chance, they would have left this medium
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki agar press bheed kii bhashaa bolne lage, sarkaar kii bhashaa bolne lage to aapkaa kya nuksaan hoga
 If you try, you will understand very easily
 bharat main ek kaam bahut chaalaaki se ho rahaa he
 Journalism is hiding its glory under the guise of nationalism
 patrkaar kaa kaam sawaal karnaa he to aaj kal aap dekhenge ki sawaal karne waalon kaa kis tarah se mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 The freedom of media is essential for democracy as much as the presence of opposition
 bharat kii patrakarita main aae din vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 Their siege is taking place as if they are not in opposition, but in government
 vipaksh ke khilaaf press atirikt rup se hamalavar ho gaya he
 You can also notice all this yourself
 raashtrapati obama ne jab apana pad choda tha tab press ke liye ek baat kahi thi, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
 "meaning the work of a journalist is not to be a spoon, his job is to question
 ye us desh ke raashtrapati kaa kahana he jis desh main first amendament ke tahat press kaa kaaphi adhikaar mila hua he
 Obama held 165 press conferences during his eight-year term
 har saal ve 20 press conference karte the
 Do you know about any President or Prime Minister or any Chief Minister in India who holds 20 press conferences in a year, where questions are answered openly
 mujhe to dhyaan nahin aa rahaa he
 President Trump mocks the press
 unke bich jane kii bajaae apane samarthakon ke bich jaakar press par hamalaa bolte hai
 In this way, people are also pitted against the press
 yahi ho rahaa he
 Powerful leaders around the world are cleverly inciting people against the press
 hamaare yahaan to ab dost yaar bhi salaah dete hai ki chodo patrakarita kii chintaa, zyaada kisi se mat bhido
 The country will go on
 lekin america ke patrakaron ne milakar raashtrapati trump ko ek lanbaa khat likhaa
 We also discussed this in prime time
 tab bhi kaha tha ki agar is patr ko hindi, bangla or marathi se lekar tamil, telugu ke akhbaar pehle panne par chhap den to patrakaron se pehle pathakon main badlaav aa jayega
 They will begin to look at the work of the press with a sharp eye
 american press kor america ke patrakaron kaa ek bada sanghathan he jiskaa centre neuyark ke colombia university ke andar he
 There are journalists of all types of news organizations and ideologies
 aadarneey niwarchit raashtrapati ji, In the last days of the beginning of your term, we have just made it clear that we look at the relationship between your administration and the American press
 ham maanate hai ki donon ke rishton main tanaav he
 The report states that your press secretary is looking at shutting down media offices from the White House
 aapane khud ko cover karne se kai news sanghathanon ko bain kiya he
 You have taunted and threatened journalists with names on Twitter
 apane samarthakon ko bhi aisa karne ke liye kaha he
 You have mocked a reporter saying that he did not like his words because he is disabled
 apane prashasan tak reporter kii pahunch samaapt kar galati karenge
 We specialize in finding various avenues to acquire information
 aapane apane abhiyaan ke dauraan jin news sanghathano ko bain kiya tha unki kai report behtareen rahi he
 We accept this challenge
 patrakarita ke niyam hamaare hai, aapke nahin hai
 Whether we talk to your officials of record or not
 ham chahen to aaf ricard brifing main aayen na aayen
 If you think that you will not get a story by silencing or banning the reporter, then it is wrong
 ham aapkaa paksh lene kaa prayaas karenge
 But we will not give place to those who twist the truth
 ve jab bhi aisa karenge ham unhen bhaga denge
 This is our right
 ham aapke jhooth ko nahin doharaayenge
 Will print your point but will know the truth
 aap or aapkaa staff white house main baitha rahe, lekin amareeki sarkaar kaaphi faili hui he
 We will deploy our reporters around the government
 aapaki agenciyon main ghusaa denge or naukarshahon se khabaren nikaal laayenge
 You may stop the news coming from your administrative building, but we will review and show your policies
 bharat main aisa patr koi likh de to netaa ek kaam karenge
 Nowadays, supporters of political parties have opened many websites
 sabake twitor acount to hai hi
 The attack on that journalist or media organization through them is that people will also start to stand against them
 unhen lagegaa ki apane netaa ko saport karne kaa matlab he usase sawaal karne vaale media kaa virodh karnaa
 Who is at a disadvantage in this affair? aapkaa hota he
 American journalists accepted the challenge of Trump, but long before that, journalists around the world have been behind scamsters and false leaders
 aapako panama papers kii yaad dilaataa hum jise indian express ne kai dinon tak lagaataar chapa tha
 Munich is a city in the southern part of Germany
 yahaan se ek akhbaar nikalataa he jiskaa naam he jud doyche tcitung
 In German, Jude means South, Deutsche means Germany and Tsiteung means newspaper
 dakshin germany kaa akhbaar kaa bada akhbaar he jiskaa cirkulation 4 lakh 32 hazaar he
 This newspaper, which started after the second world war, is very popular
 is akhbaar ko panama shahar kii ek company mosac phonseka se jude 2 lakh shell companiyon yani farji companiyon ke ek karod se adhik email or peedief file milti he
 It is alleged that this company, formed in 1977, has played a game of selling many fake companies, through which the big people of the world have hidden their money from their government and deposited it in Panama so that these tax documents are not named Panama Papers
 lakhon company or karodon dastavezon ko padhanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That too when it was necessary to investigate them in many countries of the world
 isliye jud doyche tcitung akhbaar ne in dastavezon ko International Consortium of Investigative Journalists se saajha kiya
 370 journalists from all over the world went through these documents for a year
 is samooh main bharat kii taraf se indian express bhi shaamil he jisaki website or akhbaar main panama papers ko kaaphi vistaar se chapa gaya he
 The ICIJ is a group of investigative journalists from 109 institutions around the world in 76 countries
 aparaadh, bhrashtachar ab ek desh kii seemaa tak simit nahin he,kai deshon kaa maamla ho jaataa he isliye yah zaruri he ki kai deshon ke patrkaar milakar kaam karen
 There are many types of experienced people working in ICIJ especially those who are skilled in reading government records
 tathyon kii jaanch karne vaale or vakil bhi hote hai
 Many journalists are doing this at their level in India
 kai website hai jo patrakarita kaa vikalp ban rahi hai magar unki pahunch utani nahin he jitani media kii he yaa jitani raajnneetik dalon ke niyantran vaali soshal media kii he
 Fake news is a challenge
 patrkaar bhi phek news pesh kar rahe hai or sarkarein bhi phenk news garh rahi hai
 Fake news means fake news in the name of news
 bharat main chunaav shuru hote hi chunaav ayog ped news kii chunauti se jujhane lagata he
 a wave is being created in favor of political parties by giving money or advertising in some other way
 ped news ab thik thaak puraani samasya ho chuki he
 Another news is slow news
 iskaa concept bibisi ke diarector general tony haal ne diya he
 Tony Hall believes that we cannot edit the entire Internet but cannot even sit on the sidelines
 iske liye bibisi ke bheetar intelligence unit banaai ja rahi he jo tamaam phek news kii tathyaparak jaanch kar uskaa bhandaphod karegaa
 You will see that most of the fake news is being spread by political organizations and their supporters only
 media bhi phek news banane main kam nahin he
 The BBC has accepted this challenge as a campaign
 fasebuk ne bhi phek news kii jaanch ke liye team banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The bbc's interesting thing is that we need slow news
 jisamen gaharaai ho, aankade hon, khoj ho, vishleshan ho or visheshgyata ho
 On the day that Pakistan committed barbarism with Indian soldiers, a channel and a newspaper published a news that India retaliated with the head of ten Pakistan soldiers
 ek channel ne kaha ki saat pakistanon ke sar kaat liye gaye hai
 These news appeared and also reached the people
 jabaki sena ne agle din saaf kaha ki aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he
 In the case of the army, what was the story of seven and ten heads made or someone made a brief brief? sampadakeey galatiyaan ho jaati hai, chhapane main bhi chook ho jaati he magar ye khabar pehle panne kii thi
 It was clearly written that India killed ten Pak soldiers instead of two
 ek galati mangalvaar ke prime time main mujhase bhi hui
 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Many websites have come into existence to monitor this
 Alt News kaa daawa he ki wo propaganda karne vaale un kathith patrakaron kaa pardaafaash karata he jo menstream media main apni paith bana chuke hai
 Apart from this, all kinds of rumors being published on social media are also investigated
 boomlive

 Do not tamper with it
 tippaniyan Removing the news is not easy
 patrakaron ne to behad main jaakar daakuon kaa bhi intervyuu kiya, mafia or sarganaon kaa bhi
 Journalists take many risks in extracting news
 aatankwaad ke naam par sarkaron ne patrakaron par ankush lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The UK has passed a law called The Investigative Powers Act, also called the Snooper Charter
 iske tahat jasusi ke aarope main patrkaar ko 14 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 You have to tell what you talk to your source and you can go to jail on charges of leaking secret information
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki satta ke tahkhaane main kya hota he aapako ab pataa hi nahin chalegaa
 In India too, journalists are facing similar cases
 ek kissa pakistan se sunaata hum
 Journalist Cyril Almeida of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper made a news break on 9 January this year stating that the Pakistan government has clearly told its military leadership that if there is no concrete action against terrorism, then Pakistan's international fraternity There is a danger of being isolated
 is reporter ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah faujee netritv ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar sarkari agenciyaan aatanki guton ke kilaaf karrwai karti hai yaa unpar pabandi lagaati hai to usamen faujee yaa kufia agenciyaan koi dakhal nahin dengi
 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he
 The Hoot has released a report on Press Freedom Day according to which 52 fatal assaults on journalists have taken place between January 16 and April 17
 grahamantralay kii report ke anusaar 2014-15 ke bich 142 hamale hue hai
 Reporting from a place like Bastar is not easy
 patrkaar police or naksal ke bich funs jaataa he
 In the midst of this battle, the journalist faces a challenge that he should also report the victimization of the tribals
 magar suraksha agenciyaan ko nishane par wo bhi aa jaataa he
 In the last two years, many journalists were sent to jail in Bastar who were bringing out similar stories
 kahin se bhi media ko lekar acchhee khabar nahin he
 Why is this happening, does the public not want independent media, is the desire for independent media limited to only a few people
 media kaa kaarobaar kaaphi tezi se bad rahaa he
 In the world as well as in India
 lekin kya aapke jeene kii paristhitiyaan pehle se behatar hui hai, kya aapako lagata he ki raajnneeti main javabdehi aa gai he, yaa sabakuch dharna hi he, jaisaa chal rahaa tha vaisaa hi chal rahaa he
 Why do people trust this media, whose freedom, fairness are being questioned all over the world
 in sab utaar-chadhaav ke bich pakistan 2016 kii tulana main 8 ank behatar ho gaya
 In 2016, Pakistan was ranked 147, but in 2017, it was ranked at 139
 2016 main bharat 133 number par tha jo teen ank girakar 2017 main 136 par aa gaya
 Some comments can be seen in the report by Reporters Without Borders, which has produced indexes of press freedom in the world
 is sanstha ke secretary general Christophe Deloire kaa kahana he ki loktantron main jis dar se pratibandh badhate ja rahe hai wo kaafii chintaa kii baat he or agar media kii azaadi surakshit nahin he to kisi duusari azaadi kii guarantee nahin di ja sakati
 Where will this downward spiral take us? That is, where are we going to reach by falling
 jahaan bhi authoritarian strongman model kii jeet hui he, vahaan media kii azaadi ghati he
 Public radio and TV stations have become propaganda tools in such places
 jaise poland, hungary, tanzania vagairah
 The country has become the largest prison for media professionals in the world since the failed rebellion against the Rajab Tayyib Ardogan government in Turkey (155)
 vahaan ek ekadhikaaravaadi, swechhachari sarkaar satta main he
 Putin's Russia (148) is also not far from these situations
 hamane bharat ke kuch patrakaron se unki raay mangai
 Asked him if he believed that the press in India was free
 kya unhen lagata he ki patrakarita main aane ke baad vahi kaam kar rahe hai jiske liye aae the, kya ab ve pehle se zyaada gambhirtha se sochate hai ki mauka miltaa to is madhyam ko chhod dete
 Have you ever thought that if the press starts speaking the language of the crowd, the language of the government then what will be your loss
 aap koshish karenge to bahut aasaani se samaj aa jayega
 a work is being done very cleverly in India
 rashtrawaad kii aad main patrakarita apni chamachagiri chipa rahi he
 If the work of a journalist is to question, then tomorrow you will see how those who question are mocked
 loktantr ke liye jitna media kii swatantraaa zaruri he utana hi vipaksh kii maujuudagi bhi
 Opposition is ridiculed on the day of India's journalism
 unki gheraabandi is tarah se ho rahi he jaise wo vipaksh main nahin, sarkaar main ho
 The press has additionally become aggressive against the opposition
 ye sab aap khud bhi notice kar sakate hai
 President Obama said one thing to the press when he left his post, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
" " matlab patrkaar kaa kaam chamachaa hona nahin he, uskaa kaam sawaal karnaa he
 This is said by the President of the country in which the country has got a lot of press rights under the First Amendment
 obama ne aath saal ke kaarykaal main 165 press conference kii thi
 Every year he held 20 press conferences
 kya bharat main kisi raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri yaa kisi mukhyamantri ke bare main aap jaanate hai jo saal main 20 press conference karte hon, jahaan khulkar sawaal jawaab hote hon
 i am not paying attention
 raashtrapati trump press kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Instead of going among them, they go out among their supporters and attack the press
 is tarah se logon ko bhi press ke khilaaf bhida de rahe hai
 This is happening duniya bhar main taqatvar netaa chaalaaki se logon ko press ke khilaaf bhadkaa rahe hai
 Here friends of ours also advise that leave journalism worry, do not confront anyone more
 desh chalata rahegaa
 But American journalists together wrote a long letter to President Trump
 is par bhi hamane prime time main charchaa kii thi
 Even then, it was said that if the newspaper is printed on the front page of Hindi, Bangla and Marathi to Tamil, Telugu newspapers, then there will be a change in readers before journalists
 wo press ke kaam ko paini nazar se dekhne lagenge
 The American Press Corps is a large organization of American journalists whose center is located in New York's Columbia University
 har tarah ke news sanghathan or vichaardhaara ke patrkaar hai
 Respected elected President, aapke kaarykaal ke shuru hone ke antim dinon main hamane abhi hi saaf kar dena sahi samajha ki ham aapke prashasan or amareeki press ke rishton ko kaise dekhte hai
 We believe that there is tension in their relationship
 report bataati he ki aapke press sachiv white house se media ke daftaron ko band karne kii soch rahe hai
 You have banned many news organizations from covering themselves
 aapane twitor par naam lekar patrakaron par taane kase hai, dhamkaaya he
 Has asked his supporters to do the same
 aapane ek reporter kaa yah kahkar mazaaq udaaya he ki uski baaten isliye acchhee nahin lagi ki vah viklang he
 They will make a mistake by ending the reporter's access to their administration
 ham soochna hasil karne ke tarah tarah ke raste khojane main maahir hai
 Many of the news organizations that you banned during your campaign have been excellent
 ham is chunauti ko sweekaar karte hai
 Journalism rules are ours, not yours
 ham chaahe to aapke adhikariyon se aaf ricard baat karen yaa na karen
 If we wish, do not attend the record briefing
 agar aap yah sochate hai ki reporter ko chup kara dene yaa bhaga dene se story nahin milegi to galat hai
 We will try to take your side
 lekin ham sachai ko todane marodane waalon ko jagah nahin denge
 Whenever they do this, we will drive them away
 yah hamaara adhikaar he
 We will not repeat your lie
 aapaki baat chhaapenge lekin sachai kaa pataa karenge
 You and your staff sit in the White House, but the US government is quite wide
 ham sarkaar ke chaaron taraf apane reporter tainaat kar denge
 They will get into your agencies and bring news from bureaucrats
 ho saktaa he ki aap apane prashasnic imaarat se aane vaali khabaron ko roak len lekin ham aapaki nitiyon kii samiksha karke dikhaa denge
 If someone writes such a letter in India, the leader will do one thing
 aajkal raajnneetik dalon ke samarthakon ne bahut sari website khol rakhi he
 Everyone has a Twitter account
 unke zariye us patrkaar yaa media santhaan par jo hamalaa hoga ki log bhi usee ke khilaaf khadey hone lagenge
 They will feel that supporting their leader means opposing the media questioning him
 is chakkar main nuksaan kiskaa hota he
 Belongs to you
 america ke patrakaron ne to trump kii chunauti sweekaar kii, lekin uske bahut pehle se duniya bhar ke patrkaar ghotalebaz or jhuthe netaaon ke peeche pade hai
 Remind you of the Panama Papers that were continuously raided by the Indian Express for several days
 germany ke dakshini hisse main ek shahar he munich
 From here comes a newspaper called Jude Daeche Tsiteung
 german main jud kaa matlab hota he dakshin, doyche matlab germany or tcitung matlab akhbaar
 South Germany has a large newspaper of circulation whose circulation is 4 lakh 32 thousand

 It was not easy to read millions of company and millions of documents
 wo bhi tab jab inaki jaanch ke liye duniya ke kai deshon main padtaal zaruri thi
 Therefore, the Jude Deutsche Tsiteung newspaper shared these documents with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar ek saal tak in dastavezon kii jaanch karte rahe
 The group also includes Indian Express from India whose Panama Papers have been printed in great detail in its website and newspaper
 ICIJ 76 deshon ke duniya bhar ke 109 sansthaanon ke khoji patrakaron kaa ek samooh he
 Crime, corruption is no longer confined to the border of one country, becomes the case of many countries, so it is important that journalists of many countries work together
 ICIJ main kai prakaar ke anbhavi log kaam karte hai khaskar ve log jo sarkari ricard ko padhane main daksh hote hai
 There are also fact checkers and lawyers
 bharat main aisa kai patrkaar apane str par kar rahe hai
 There are many websites that are becoming an alternative to journalism but they do not have as much reach as the media or social media controlled by political parties
 phek news ek chunauti to he hi
 Journalists are also presenting fake news and governments are also throwing news
 phek news matlab news ke naam par nakli news
 As soon as elections begin in India, the Election Commission starts to face the challenge of paid news
 paisa dekar yaa kisi or tareeke se vigyaapan dekar raajnneetik dalon ke haq main lahar paidaa kii ja rahi he
 Paid news is now a chronic problem
 ek or news he slo news
 The concept has been given by the BBC Director General Tony Hall
 tony haul kaa maananaa he ki ham sara internet to sampadit nahin kar sakate magar kinare bhi nahin baith sakate
 For this, an intelligence unit is being created within the BBC which will fact-check all fake news and expose it
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar phek news raajnneetik sanghathanon or unke samarthakon dwaara hi failaaye ja rahe hai
 Media is also no less in making fake news
 bibisi ne is chunauti ko abhiyaan ke taur par sweekaar kiya he
 Facebook has also announced to form a team to investigate fake news
 bibisi kii yah baat dilachasp he ki hamen slo news kii zarurat he
 Which has depth, data, search, analysis and expertise
 jis din pakistan ne bhartiya sainikon ke saath barbarta kii us din ek channel or ek akhbaar ne ek khabar chhaapi ki bharat ne javaabi karrwai karte hue das pakistan sainikon ke sar kaat liye hai
 One channel said that seven Pakistanis have been beheaded
 ye khabaren chhapi or logon tak pahunch bhi gayi
 Whereas the army said clearly the next day that no such incident had taken place
 sena ke maamle main saat or das sar kii kahani kya banaai gai yaa kisi ne galat brif kiya
 Editorial mistakes are made, there is a mistake in printing, but this news was from the front page
 saaf saaf likhaa tha ki bharat ne do ke badale das paak sainik maar giraae
 a mistake also occurred to me in Tuesday's prime time
 us galati main do galati hui
 Many newspapers published the news that 100 grams of curd has been purchased in the railway for Rs 972
 yah soochna aar tii ai se mili he
 When the Railways investigated, it was found that the officials gave incorrect information in RTI
 in adhikariyon ko suspend kar diya gaya he
 We showed this news but till then i did not know about the railway's response
 phir ye galati he
 Railway officials gave wrong information to RTI, it appeared in RTI newspapers and from there in prime time
 hamane duusari galati ye ki 972 rupee ko 9,720 rupee likh diya
 i have no hesitation in apologizing for such a mistake
 lekin ye phek news nahin he
 Fake news is that which is being circulated among you in many ways these days

 Journalists went to the rugged and interviewed the dacoits as well as the mafia and gangsters
 khabaron ko nikaalane main patrkaar kai tarah ke jokhim uthaate hai
 Governments have started curbing journalists in the name of terrorism
 britain main ek kanoon paas hua he the Investigative Powers Act, ise snupar charter bhi kehete hai
 Under this, the journalist can be imprisoned for 14 years on charges of espionage
 aap apane sorce se kya baat karte hai wo bataanaa hoga or gupt soochna li karne ke aarope main jail ja sakate hai
 This means that you will not know what happens in the basement of power
 bharat main bhi patrakaron par is tarah ke mukademe ho rahe hai

 pakistan ke don akhbaar ke patrkaar siril alamida ne is saal 9 janvari ko ek khabar brake kii jisamen kaha gaya ki pakistan kii sarkaar ne apane faujee netritv ko saafe kah diya he ki agar aatankwaad ke kilaaf thos karrwai nahin kii gai to pakistan ke antarrashtriya birdari main alag thalag padane kaa khatara he
 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is
 di hoot ne press swatantraaa diwas par ek report jari kii he jiske anusaar janvari 16 se april 17 ke bich patrakaron par 52 jaanaleva hamale hue hai
 According to the Home Ministry report, there have been 142 attacks between 2014-15
 bastar jaisi jagah se report karnaa aasaan nahin
 Journalist gets caught between police and Naxalites
 is jang ke bich patrkaar ke saamne chunauti hoti he ki wo adivaasiyon ke saath ho rahe zulm kii khabar bhi report kare
 But he also comes under target of security agencies
 pichley do saal main bastar main aise kai patrakaron ko jail bheja gaya jo aisi hi kahaniyaan baahar laa rahe the
 Some comments can be seen in the report by Reporters Without Borders, which has produced indexes of press freedom in the world
 is sanstha ke secretary general Christophe Deloire kaa kahana he ki loktantron main jis dar se pratibandh badhate ja rahe hai wo kaafii chintaa kii baat he or agar media kii azaadi surakshit nahin he to kisi duusari azaadi kii guarantee nahin di ja sakati
 Where will this downward spiral take us? That is, where are we going to reach by falling
 jahaan bhi authoritarian strongman model kii jeet hui he, vahaan media kii azaadi ghati he
 Public radio and TV stations have become propaganda tools in such places
 jaise poland, hungary, tanzania vagairah
 The country has become the largest prison for media professionals in the world since the failed rebellion against the Rajab Tayyib Ardogan government in Turkey (155)
 vahaan ek ekadhikaaravaadi, swechhachari sarkaar satta main he
 Putin's Russia (148) is also not far from these situations
 hamane bharat ke kuch patrakaron se unki raay mangai
 Asked him if he believed that the press in India was free
 kya unhen lagata he ki patrakarita main aane ke baad vahi kaam kar rahe hai jiske liye aae the, kya ab ve pehle se zyaada gambhirtha se sochate hai ki mauka miltaa to is madhyam ko chhod dete
 Have you ever thought that if the press starts speaking the language of the crowd, the language of the government then what will be your loss
 aap koshish karenge to bahut aasaani se samaj aa jayega
 a work is being done very cleverly in India
 rashtrawaad kii aad main patrakarita apni chamachagiri chipa rahi he
 If the work of a journalist is to question, then tomorrow you will see how those who question are mocked
 loktantr ke liye jitna media kii swatantraaa zaruri he utana hi vipaksh kii maujuudagi bhi
 Opposition is ridiculed on the day of India's journalism
 unki gheraabandi is tarah se ho rahi he jaise wo vipaksh main nahin, sarkaar main ho
 The press has additionally become aggressive against the opposition
 ye sab aap khud bhi notice kar sakate hai
 President Obama said one thing to the press when he left his post, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
" " matlab patrkaar kaa kaam chamachaa hona nahin he, uskaa kaam sawaal karnaa he
 This is said by the President of the country in which the country has got a lot of press rights under the First Amendment
 obama ne aath saal ke kaarykaal main 165 press conference kii thi
 Every year he held 20 press conferences
 kya bharat main kisi raashtrapati yaa pradhanmantri yaa kisi mukhyamantri ke bare main aap jaanate hai jo saal main 20 press conference karte hon, jahaan khulkar sawaal jawaab hote hon
 i am not paying attention
 raashtrapati trump press kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Instead of going among them, they go out among their supporters and attack the press
 is tarah se logon ko bhi press ke khilaaf bhida de rahe hai
 This is happening duniya bhar main taqatvar netaa chaalaaki se logon ko press ke khilaaf bhadkaa rahe hai
 Here friends of ours also advise that leave journalism worry, do not confront anyone more
 desh chalata rahegaa
 But American journalists together wrote a long letter to President Trump
 is par bhi hamane prime time main charchaa kii thi
 Even then, it was said that if the newspaper is printed on the front page of Hindi, Bangla and Marathi to Tamil, Telugu newspapers, then there will be a change in readers before journalists
 wo press ke kaam ko paini nazar se dekhne lagenge

 You have banned many news organizations from covering themselves

 Has asked his supporters to do the same
 aapane ek reporter kaa yah kahkar mazaaq udaaya he ki uski baaten isliye acchhee nahin lagi ki vah viklang he
 They will make a mistake by ending the reporter's access to their administration
 ham soochna hasil karne ke tarah tarah ke raste khojane main maahir hai
 Many of the news organizations that you banned during your campaign have been excellent
 ham is chunauti ko sweekaar karte hai
 Journalism rules are ours, not yours
 ham chaahe to aapke adhikariyon se aaf ricard baat karen yaa na karen
 If we wish, do not attend the record briefing
 agar aap yah sochate hai ki reporter ko chup kara dene yaa bhaga dene se story nahin milegi to galat hai
 We will try to take your side
 lekin ham sachai ko todane marodane waalon ko jagah nahin denge
 Whenever they do this, we will drive them away
 yah hamaara adhikaar he
 We will not repeat your lie
 aapaki baat chhaapenge lekin sachai kaa pataa karenge
 You and your staff sit in the White House, but the US government is quite wide
 ham sarkaar ke chaaron taraf apane reporter tainaat kar denge
 They will get into your agencies and bring news from bureaucrats
 ho saktaa he ki aap apane prashasnic imaarat se aane vaali khabaron ko roak len lekin ham aapaki nitiyon kii samiksha karke dikhaa denge
 If someone writes such a letter in India, the leader will do one thing
 aajkal raajnneetik dalon ke samarthakon ne bahut sari website khol rakhi he
 Everyone has a Twitter account
 unke zariye us patrkaar yaa media santhaan par jo hamalaa hoga ki log bhi usee ke khilaaf khadey hone lagenge
 They will feel that supporting their leader means opposing the media questioning him
 is chakkar main nuksaan kiskaa hota he
 Belongs to you
 america ke patrakaron ne to trump kii chunauti sweekaar kii, lekin uske bahut pehle se duniya bhar ke patrkaar ghotalebaz or jhuthe netaaon ke peeche pade hai
 Remind you of the Panama Papers that were continuously raided by the Indian Express for several days

 It was not easy to read millions of company and millions of documents
 wo bhi tab jab inaki jaanch ke liye duniya ke kai deshon main padtaal zaruri thi
 Therefore, the Jude Deutsche Tsiteung newspaper shared these documents with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists
 duniya bhar ke 370 patrkaar ek saal tak in dastavezon kii jaanch karte rahe
 The group also includes Indian Express from India whose Panama Papers have been printed in great detail in its website and newspaper
 ICIJ 76 deshon ke duniya bhar ke 109 sansthaanon ke khoji patrakaron kaa ek samooh he
 Crime, corruption is no longer confined to the border of one country, becomes the case of many countries, so it is important that journalists of many countries work together
 ICIJ main kai prakaar ke anbhavi log kaam karte hai khaskar ve log jo sarkari ricard ko padhane main daksh hote hai
 There are also fact checkers and lawyers
 bharat main aisa kai patrkaar apane str par kar rahe hai
 There are many websites that are becoming an alternative to journalism but they do not have as much reach as the media or social media controlled by political parties
 phek news ek chunauti to he hi
 Journalists are also presenting fake news and governments are also throwing news
 phek news matlab news ke naam par nakli news
 As soon as elections begin in India, the Election Commission starts to face the challenge of paid news
 paisa dekar yaa kisi or tareeke se vigyaapan dekar raajnneetik dalon ke haq main lahar paidaa kii ja rahi he
 Paid news is now a chronic problem
 ek or news he slo news
 The concept has been given by the BBC Director General Tony Hall
 tony haul kaa maananaa he ki ham sara internet to sampadit nahin kar sakate magar kinare bhi nahin baith sakate
 For this, an intelligence unit is being created within the BBC which will fact-check all fake news and expose it
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar phek news raajnneetik sanghathanon or unke samarthakon dwaara hi failaaye ja rahe hai
 Media is also no less in making fake news

 Whereas the army said clearly the next day that no such incident had taken place

 Editorial mistakes are made, there is a mistake in printing, but this news was from the front page

 Many newspapers published the news that 100 grams of curd has been purchased in the railway for Rs 972

 Railway officials gave wrong information to RTI, it appeared in RTI newspapers and from there in prime time

 i have no hesitation in apologizing for such a mistake
 lekin ye phek news nahin he

 Governments have started curbing journalists in the name of terrorism
 britain main ek kanoon paas hua he the Investigative Powers Act, ise snupar charter bhi kehete hai
 Under this, the journalist can be imprisoned for 14 years on charges of espionage
 aap apane sorce se kya baat karte hai wo bataanaa hoga or gupt soochna li karne ke aarope main jail ja sakate hai
 This means that you will not know what happens in the basement of power
 bharat main bhi patrakaron par is tarah ke mukademe ho rahe hai
 i narrate an anecdote from Pakistan
 pakistan ke don akhbaar ke patrkaar siril alamida ne is saal 9 janvari ko ek khabar brake kii jisamen kaha gaya ki pakistan kii sarkaar ne apane faujee netritv ko saafe kah diya he ki agar aatankwaad ke kilaaf thos karrwai nahin kii gai to pakistan ke antarrashtriya birdari main alag thalag padane kaa khatara he
 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is
 di hoot ne press swatantraaa diwas par ek report jari kii he jiske anusaar janvari 16 se april 17 ke bich patrakaron par 52 jaanaleva hamale hue hai
 According to the Home Ministry report, there have been 142 attacks between 2014-15
 bastar jaisi jagah se report karnaa aasaan nahin

 We asked for their opinion from some journalists in India
 unase poocha ki kya ve maanate hai ki bharat main press azaad he
 Do they think that after coming into journalism, they are doing the same work for which they had come, now do they think more seriously than before that if they had the chance, they would have left this medium
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki agar press bheed kii bhashaa bolne lage, sarkaar kii bhashaa bolne lage to aapkaa kya nuksaan hoga
 If you try, you will understand very easily
 bharat main ek kaam bahut chaalaaki se ho rahaa he
 Journalism is hiding its glory under the guise of nationalism
 patrkaar kaa kaam sawaal karnaa he to aaj kal aap dekhenge ki sawaal karne waalon kaa kis tarah se mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 The freedom of media is essential for democracy as much as the presence of opposition
 bharat kii patrakarita main aae din vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 Their siege is taking place as if they are not in opposition, but in government
 vipaksh ke khilaaf press atirikt rup se hamalavar ho gaya he
 You can also notice all this yourself
 raashtrapati obama ne jab apana pad choda tha tab press ke liye ek baat kahi thi, "you are not supposed to be sycophants, you are supposed to be skeptics
 "meaning the work of a journalist is not to be a spoon, his job is to question
 ye us desh ke raashtrapati kaa kahana he jis desh main first amendament ke tahat press kaa kaaphi adhikaar mila hua he
 Obama held 165 press conferences during his eight-year term
 har saal ve 20 press conference karte the
 Do you know about any President or Prime Minister or any Chief Minister in India who holds 20 press conferences in a year, where questions are answered openly
 mujhe to dhyaan nahin aa rahaa he
 President Trump mocks the press
 unke bich jane kii bajaae apane samarthakon ke bich jaakar press par hamalaa bolte hai
 In this way, people are also pitted against the press
 yahi ho rahaa he
 Powerful leaders around the world are cleverly inciting people against the press
 hamaare yahaan to ab dost yaar bhi salaah dete hai ki chodo patrakarita kii chintaa, zyaada kisi se mat bhido
 The country will go on
 lekin america ke patrakaron ne milakar raashtrapati trump ko ek lanbaa khat likhaa
 We also discussed this in prime time
 tab bhi kaha tha ki agar is patr ko hindi, bangla or marathi se lekar tamil, telugu ke akhbaar pehle panne par chhap den to patrakaron se pehle pathakon main badlaav aa jayega
 They will begin to look at the work of the press with a sharp eye
 american press kor america ke patrakaron kaa ek bada sanghathan he jiskaa centre neuyark ke colombia university ke andar he
 There are journalists of all types of news organizations and ideologies
 aadarneey niwarchit raashtrapati ji, In the last days of the beginning of your term, we have just made it clear that we look at the relationship between your administration and the American press
 ham maanate hai ki donon ke rishton main tanaav he
 The report states that your press secretary is looking at shutting down media offices from the White House
 aapane khud ko cover karne se kai news sanghathanon ko bain kiya he
 You have taunted and threatened journalists with names on Twitter
 apane samarthakon ko bhi aisa karne ke liye kaha he
 You have mocked a reporter saying that he did not like his words because he is disabled
 apane prashasan tak reporter kii pahunch samaapt kar galati karenge
 We specialize in finding various avenues to acquire information
 aapane apane abhiyaan ke dauraan jin news sanghathano ko bain kiya tha unki kai report behtareen rahi he
 We accept this challenge
 patrakarita ke niyam hamaare hai, aapke nahin hai
 Whether we talk to your officials of record or not
 ham chahen to aaf ricard brifing main aayen na aayen
 If you think that you will not get a story by silencing or banning the reporter, then it is wrong
 ham aapkaa paksh lene kaa prayaas karenge
 But we will not give place to those who twist the truth
 ve jab bhi aisa karenge ham unhen bhaga denge
 This is our right
 ham aapke jhooth ko nahin doharaayenge
 Will print your point but will know the truth
 aap or aapkaa staff white house main baitha rahe, lekin amareeki sarkaar kaaphi faili hui he
 We will deploy our reporters around the government
 aapaki agenciyon main ghusaa denge or naukarshahon se khabaren nikaal laayenge
 You may stop the news coming from your administrative building, but we will review and show your policies
 bharat main aisa patr koi likh de to netaa ek kaam karenge
 Nowadays, supporters of political parties have opened many websites
 sabake twitor acount to hai hi
 The attack on that journalist or media organization through them is that people will also start to stand against them
 unhen lagegaa ki apane netaa ko saport karne kaa matlab he usase sawaal karne vaale media kaa virodh karnaa
 Who is at a disadvantage in this affair? aapkaa hota he
 American journalists accepted the challenge of Trump, but long before that, journalists around the world have been behind scamsters and false leaders
 aapako panama papers kii yaad dilaataa hum jise indian express ne kai dinon tak lagaataar chapa tha
 Munich is a city in the southern part of Germany
 yahaan se ek akhbaar nikalataa he jiskaa naam he jud doyche tcitung
 In German, Jude means South, Deutsche means Germany and Tsiteung means newspaper
 dakshin germany kaa akhbaar kaa bada akhbaar he jiskaa cirkulation 4 lakh 32 hazaar he
 This newspaper, which started after the second world war, is very popular
 is akhbaar ko panama shahar kii ek company mosac phonseka se jude 2 lakh shell companiyon yani farji companiyon ke ek karod se adhik email or peedief file milti he
 It is alleged that this company, formed in 1977, has played a game of selling many fake companies, through which the big people of the world have hidden their money from their government and deposited it in Panama so that these tax documents are not named Panama Papers
 lakhon company or karodon dastavezon ko padhanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That too when it was necessary to investigate them in many countries of the world
 isliye jud doyche tcitung akhbaar ne in dastavezon ko International Consortium of Investigative Journalists se saajha kiya
 370 journalists from all over the world went through these documents for a year
 is samooh main bharat kii taraf se indian express bhi shaamil he jisaki website or akhbaar main panama papers ko kaaphi vistaar se chapa gaya he
 The ICIJ is a group of investigative journalists from 109 institutions around the world in 76 countries
 aparaadh, bhrashtachar ab ek desh kii seemaa tak simit nahin he,kai deshon kaa maamla ho jaataa he isliye yah zaruri he ki kai deshon ke patrkaar milakar kaam karen
 There are many types of experienced people working in ICIJ especially those who are skilled in reading government records
 tathyon kii jaanch karne vaale or vakil bhi hote hai
 Many journalists are doing this at their level in India
 kai website hai jo patrakarita kaa vikalp ban rahi hai magar unki pahunch utani nahin he jitani media kii he yaa jitani raajnneetik dalon ke niyantran vaali soshal media kii he
 Fake news is a challenge
 patrkaar bhi phek news pesh kar rahe hai or sarkarein bhi phenk news garh rahi hai
 Fake news means fake news in the name of news
 bharat main chunaav shuru hote hi chunaav ayog ped news kii chunauti se jujhane lagata he
 a wave is being created in favor of political parties by giving money or advertising in some other way
 ped news ab thik thaak puraani samasya ho chuki he
 Another news is slow news
 iskaa concept bibisi ke diarector general tony haal ne diya he
 Tony Hall believes that we cannot edit the entire Internet but cannot even sit on the sidelines
 iske liye bibisi ke bheetar intelligence unit banaai ja rahi he jo tamaam phek news kii tathyaparak jaanch kar uskaa bhandaphod karegaa
 You will see that most of the fake news is being spread by political organizations and their supporters only
 media bhi phek news banane main kam nahin he
 The BBC has accepted this challenge as a campaign
 fasebuk ne bhi phek news kii jaanch ke liye team banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The bbc's interesting thing is that we need slow news
 jisamen gaharaai ho, aankade hon, khoj ho, vishleshan ho or visheshgyata ho
 On the day that Pakistan committed barbarism with Indian soldiers, a channel and a newspaper published a news that India retaliated with the head of ten Pakistan soldiers
 ek channel ne kaha ki saat pakistanon ke sar kaat liye gaye hai
 These news appeared and also reached the people
 jabaki sena ne agle din saaf kaha ki aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he
 In the case of the army, what was the story of seven and ten heads made or someone made a brief brief? sampadakeey galatiyaan ho jaati hai, chhapane main bhi chook ho jaati he magar ye khabar pehle panne kii thi
 It was clearly written that India killed ten Pak soldiers instead of two
 ek galati mangalvaar ke prime time main mujhase bhi hui
 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Many websites have come into existence to monitor this
 Alt News kaa daawa he ki wo propaganda karne vaale un kathith patrakaron kaa pardaafaash karata he jo menstream media main apni paith bana chuke hai
 Apart from this, all kinds of rumors being published on social media are also investigated

 patrakaron ne to behad main jaakar daakuon kaa bhi intervyuu kiya, mafia or sarganaon kaa bhi
 Journalists take many risks in extracting news
 aatankwaad ke naam par sarkaron ne patrakaron par ankush lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The UK has passed a law called The Investigative Powers Act, also called the Snooper Charter
 iske tahat jasusi ke aarope main patrkaar ko 14 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 You have to tell what you talk to your source and you can go to jail on charges of leaking secret information
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki satta ke tahkhaane main kya hota he aapako ab pataa hi nahin chalegaa
 In India too, journalists are facing similar cases
 ek kissa pakistan se sunaata hum
 Journalist Cyril Almeida of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper made a news break on 9 January this year stating that the Pakistan government has clearly told its military leadership that if there is no concrete action against terrorism, then Pakistan's international fraternity There is a danger of being isolated
 is reporter ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah faujee netritv ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar sarkari agenciyaan aatanki guton ke kilaaf karrwai karti hai yaa unpar pabandi lagaati hai to usamen faujee yaa kufia agenciyaan koi dakhal nahin dengi
 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he
 The Hoot has released a report on Press Freedom Day according to which 52 fatal assaults on journalists have taken place between January 16 and April 17
 grahamantralay kii report ke anusaar 2014-15 ke bich 142 hamale hue hai
 Reporting from a place like Bastar is not easy
 patrkaar police or naksal ke bich funs jaataa he
 In the midst of this battle, the journalist faces a challenge that he should also report the victimization of the tribals
 magar suraksha agenciyaan ko nishane par wo bhi aa jaataa he
 In the last two years, many journalists were sent to jail in Bastar who were bringing out similar stories
 kabhi aapane sochaa he ki agar press bheed kii bhashaa bolne lage, sarkaar kii bhashaa bolne lage to aapkaa kya nuksaan hoga
 If you try, you will understand very easily
 bharat main ek kaam bahut chaalaaki se ho rahaa he
 Journalism is hiding its glory under the guise of nationalism
 patrkaar kaa kaam sawaal karnaa he to aaj kal aap dekhenge ki sawaal karne waalon kaa kis tarah se mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 The freedom of media is essential for democracy as much as the presence of opposition
 bharat kii patrakarita main aae din vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he
 Their siege is taking place as if they are not in opposition, but in government
 vipaksh ke khilaaf press atirikt rup se hamalavar ho gaya he
 You can also notice all this yourself

 "meaning the work of a journalist is not to be a spoon, his job is to question
 ye us desh ke raashtrapati kaa kahana he jis desh main first amendament ke tahat press kaa kaaphi adhikaar mila hua he
 Obama held 165 press conferences during his eight-year term
 har saal ve 20 press conference karte the
 Do you know about any President or Prime Minister or any Chief Minister in India who holds 20 press conferences in a year, where questions are answered openly
 mujhe to dhyaan nahin aa rahaa he
 President Trump mocks the press
 unke bich jane kii bajaae apane samarthakon ke bich jaakar press par hamalaa bolte hai
 In this way, people are also pitted against the press
 yahi ho rahaa he
 Powerful leaders around the world are cleverly inciting people against the press
 hamaare yahaan to ab dost yaar bhi salaah dete hai ki chodo patrakarita kii chintaa, zyaada kisi se mat bhido
 The country will go on
 lekin america ke patrakaron ne milakar raashtrapati trump ko ek lanbaa khat likhaa
 We also discussed this in prime time
 tab bhi kaha tha ki agar is patr ko hindi, bangla or marathi se lekar tamil, telugu ke akhbaar pehle panne par chhap den to patrakaron se pehle pathakon main badlaav aa jayega
 They will begin to look at the work of the press with a sharp eye
 american press kor america ke patrakaron kaa ek bada sanghathan he jiskaa centre neuyark ke colombia university ke andar he
 There are journalists of all types of news organizations and ideologies
 aadarneey niwarchit raashtrapati ji, In the last days of the beginning of your term, we have just made it clear that we look at the relationship between your administration and the American press
 ham maanate hai ki donon ke rishton main tanaav he
 The report states that your press secretary is looking at shutting down media offices from the White House
 aapane khud ko cover karne se kai news sanghathanon ko bain kiya he
 You have taunted and threatened journalists with names on Twitter
 apane samarthakon ko bhi aisa karne ke liye kaha he
 You have mocked a reporter saying that he did not like his words because he is disabled
 apane prashasan tak reporter kii pahunch samaapt kar galati karenge
 We specialize in finding various avenues to acquire information
 aapane apane abhiyaan ke dauraan jin news sanghathano ko bain kiya tha unki kai report behtareen rahi he
 We accept this challenge
 patrakarita ke niyam hamaare hai, aapke nahin hai
 Whether we talk to your officials of record or not
 ham chahen to aaf ricard brifing main aayen na aayen
 If you think that you will not get a story by silencing or banning the reporter, then it is wrong
 ham aapkaa paksh lene kaa prayaas karenge
 But we will not give place to those who twist the truth
 ve jab bhi aisa karenge ham unhen bhaga denge
 This is our right
 ham aapke jhooth ko nahin doharaayenge
 Will print your point but will know the truth
 aap or aapkaa staff white house main baitha rahe, lekin amareeki sarkaar kaaphi faili hui he
 We will deploy our reporters around the government
 aapaki agenciyon main ghusaa denge or naukarshahon se khabaren nikaal laayenge
 You may stop the news coming from your administrative building, but we will review and show your policies
 bharat main aisa patr koi likh de to netaa ek kaam karenge
 Nowadays, supporters of political parties have opened many websites
 sabake twitor acount to hai hi
 The attack on that journalist or media organization through them is that people will also start to stand against them
 unhen lagegaa ki apane netaa ko saport karne kaa matlab he usase sawaal karne vaale media kaa virodh karnaa
 Who is at a disadvantage in this affair? aapkaa hota he
 American journalists accepted the challenge of Trump, but long before that, journalists around the world have been behind scamsters and false leaders
 aapako panama papers kii yaad dilaataa hum jise indian express ne kai dinon tak lagaataar chapa tha
 Munich is a city in the southern part of Germany
 yahaan se ek akhbaar nikalataa he jiskaa naam he jud doyche tcitung
 In German, Jude means South, Deutsche means Germany and Tsiteung means newspaper
 dakshin germany kaa akhbaar kaa bada akhbaar he jiskaa cirkulation 4 lakh 32 hazaar he
 This newspaper, which started after the second world war, is very popular
 is akhbaar ko panama shahar kii ek company mosac phonseka se jude 2 lakh shell companiyon yani farji companiyon ke ek karod se adhik email or peedief file milti he
 It is alleged that this company, formed in 1977, has played a game of selling many fake companies, through which the big people of the world have hidden their money from their government and deposited it in Panama so that these tax documents are not named Panama Papers
 lakhon company or karodon dastavezon ko padhanaa aasaan nahin tha
 That too when it was necessary to investigate them in many countries of the world
 isliye jud doyche tcitung akhbaar ne in dastavezon ko International Consortium of Investigative Journalists se saajha kiya
 370 journalists from all over the world went through these documents for a year
 is samooh main bharat kii taraf se indian express bhi shaamil he jisaki website or akhbaar main panama papers ko kaaphi vistaar se chapa gaya he
 The ICIJ is a group of investigative journalists from 109 institutions around the world in 76 countries
 aparaadh, bhrashtachar ab ek desh kii seemaa tak simit nahin he,kai deshon kaa maamla ho jaataa he isliye yah zaruri he ki kai deshon ke patrkaar milakar kaam karen
 There are many types of experienced people working in ICIJ especially those who are skilled in reading government records
 tathyon kii jaanch karne vaale or vakil bhi hote hai
 Many journalists are doing this at their level in India
 kai website hai jo patrakarita kaa vikalp ban rahi hai magar unki pahunch utani nahin he jitani media kii he yaa jitani raajnneetik dalon ke niyantran vaali soshal media kii he
 Fake news is a challenge
 patrkaar bhi phek news pesh kar rahe hai or sarkarein bhi phenk news garh rahi hai
 Fake news means fake news in the name of news
 bharat main chunaav shuru hote hi chunaav ayog ped news kii chunauti se jujhane lagata he
 a wave is being created in favor of political parties by giving money or advertising in some other way
 ped news ab thik thaak puraani samasya ho chuki he
 Another news is slow news
 iskaa concept bibisi ke diarector general tony haal ne diya he
 Tony Hall believes that we cannot edit the entire Internet but cannot even sit on the sidelines
 iske liye bibisi ke bheetar intelligence unit banaai ja rahi he jo tamaam phek news kii tathyaparak jaanch kar uskaa bhandaphod karegaa
 You will see that most of the fake news is being spread by political organizations and their supporters only
 media bhi phek news banane main kam nahin he
 The BBC has accepted this challenge as a campaign
 fasebuk ne bhi phek news kii jaanch ke liye team banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The bbc's interesting thing is that we need slow news
 jisamen gaharaai ho, aankade hon, khoj ho, vishleshan ho or visheshgyata ho
 On the day that Pakistan committed barbarism with Indian soldiers, a channel and a newspaper published a news that India retaliated with the head of ten Pakistan soldiers
 ek channel ne kaha ki saat pakistanon ke sar kaat liye gaye hai
 These news appeared and also reached the people
 jabaki sena ne agle din saaf kaha ki aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he
 In the case of the army, what was the story of seven and ten heads made or someone made a brief brief? sampadakeey galatiyaan ho jaati hai, chhapane main bhi chook ho jaati he magar ye khabar pehle panne kii thi
 It was clearly written that India killed ten Pak soldiers instead of two
 ek galati mangalvaar ke prime time main mujhase bhi hui
 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Many websites have come into existence to monitor this
 Alt News kaa daawa he ki wo propaganda karne vaale un kathith patrakaron kaa pardaafaash karata he jo menstream media main apni paith bana chuke hai
 Apart from this, all kinds of rumors being published on social media are also investigated

 Journalists take many risks in extracting news
 aatankwaad ke naam par sarkaron ne patrakaron par ankush lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The UK has passed a law called The Investigative Powers Act, also called the Snooper Charter
 iske tahat jasusi ke aarope main patrkaar ko 14 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 You have to tell what you talk to your source and you can go to jail on charges of leaking secret information
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki satta ke tahkhaane main kya hota he aapako ab pataa hi nahin chalegaa
 In India too, journalists are facing similar cases
 ek kissa pakistan se sunaata hum
 Journalist Cyril Almeida of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper made a news break on 9 January this year stating that the Pakistan government has clearly told its military leadership that if there is no concrete action against terrorism, then Pakistan's international fraternity There is a danger of being isolated
 is reporter ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah faujee netritv ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar sarkari agenciyaan aatanki guton ke kilaaf karrwai karti hai yaa unpar pabandi lagaati hai to usamen faujee yaa kufia agenciyaan koi dakhal nahin dengi
 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he
 The Hoot has released a report on Press Freedom Day according to which 52 fatal assaults on journalists have taken place between January 16 and April 17
 grahamantralay kii report ke anusaar 2014-15 ke bich 142 hamale hue hai
 Reporting from a place like Bastar is not easy
 patrkaar police or naksal ke bich funs jaataa he
 In the midst of this battle, the journalist faces a challenge that he should also report the victimization of the tribals
 magar suraksha agenciyaan ko nishane par wo bhi aa jaataa he
 In the last two years, many journalists were sent to jail in Bastar who were bringing out similar stories
 raashtrapati trump press kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Instead of going among them, they go out among their supporters and attack the press
 is tarah se logon ko bhi press ke khilaaf bhida de rahe hai
 This is happening duniya bhar main taqatvar netaa chaalaaki se logon ko press ke khilaaf bhadkaa rahe hai
 Here friends of ours also advise that leave journalism worry, do not confront anyone more
 desh chalata rahegaa
 But American journalists together wrote a long letter to President Trump
 is par bhi hamane prime time main charchaa kii thi
 Even then, it was said that if the newspaper is printed on the front page of Hindi, Bangla and Marathi to Tamil, Telugu newspapers, then there will be a change in readers before journalists

 If someone writes such a letter in India, the leader will do one thing
 aajkal raajnneetik dalon ke samarthakon ne bahut sari website khol rakhi he
 Everyone has a Twitter account

 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki

 This reporter explained in detail how the military leadership has been given a message that if government agencies act against or ban terrorist groups, then military or intelligence agencies will not interfere in it
 abhi tak apni taaqatvar fouj ko aisa sandesh pakistan kii naagarik sarkaar ke daayre se baahar samajha jaataa tha
 The government said that this is wrong news
 lekin reporter apni khabar par ad gaya
 The Dawn newspaper also insisted that the reporter's news was correct
 akhbaar ke editor in cheef ne kaha tha ki sarkaar akhbaar ko bali kaa bakra banane se baaj aayaa
 Some other newspapers also supported Dawn in this matter
 pakistan kii sarkaar reporter kaa kuch nahin kar saki
 You must be wondering why we did not give some examples from India, how many examples, in fact, an hour would have fallen short and then you must have known about India how independent the media is

 Everyone has a Twitter account
 unke zariye us patrkaar yaa media santhaan par jo hamalaa hoga ki log bhi usee ke khilaaf khadey hone lagenge

 Fake news is a challenge
 patrkaar bhi phek news pesh kar rahe hai or sarkarein bhi phenk news garh rahi hai
 Fake news means fake news in the name of news
 bharat main chunaav shuru hote hi chunaav ayog ped news kii chunauti se jujhane lagata he
 a wave is being created in favor of political parties by giving money or advertising in some other way
 ped news ab thik thaak puraani samasya ho chuki he
 Another news is slow news
 iskaa concept bibisi ke diarector general tony haal ne diya he
 Tony Hall believes that we cannot edit the entire Internet but cannot even sit on the sidelines
 iske liye bibisi ke bheetar intelligence unit banaai ja rahi he jo tamaam phek news kii tathyaparak jaanch kar uskaa bhandaphod karegaa
 You will see that most of the fake news is being spread by political organizations and their supporters only
 media bhi phek news banane main kam nahin he
 The BBC has accepted this challenge as a campaign
 fasebuk ne bhi phek news kii jaanch ke liye team banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The bbc's interesting thing is that we need slow news
 jisamen gaharaai ho, aankade hon, khoj ho, vishleshan ho or visheshgyata ho
 On the day that Pakistan committed barbarism with Indian soldiers, a channel and a newspaper published a news that India retaliated with the head of ten Pakistan soldiers
 ek channel ne kaha ki saat pakistanon ke sar kaat liye gaye hai
 These news appeared and also reached the people
 jabaki sena ne agle din saaf kaha ki aisi koi ghatana nahin hui he
 In the case of the army, what was the story of seven and ten heads made or someone made a brief brief? sampadakeey galatiyaan ho jaati hai, chhapane main bhi chook ho jaati he magar ye khabar pehle panne kii thi
 It was clearly written that India killed ten Pak soldiers instead of two
 ek galati mangalvaar ke prime time main mujhase bhi hui
 There were two mistakes in that mistake
 kai akhabaaron ne khabar chhaapi ki railway main 972 rupee main 100 gram dahi kharida gaya he
 This information has been received from RTI
 railway ne jab jaanch kii to paaya ki adhikariyon ne aar tii ai main galat jaankaree di
 These officers have been suspended
 hamane ye khabar to dikhaai magar tab tak railway kii pratikriya kaa mujhe pataa nahin chalaa tha
 Then it is a mistake
 railway adhikariyon ne aar tii ai ko galat jaankaree di, wo aar tii ai akhabaaron main chhapi or vahaan se prime time main
 The second mistake we made was that Rs 972 was written down to Rs 9,720
 aisi galati ke liye maafee maangane main mujhe koi sankoch nahin he
 But this is not fake news
 phek news wo he jise aaj kal kai tarah se aapke bich pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 Many websites have come into existence to monitor this
 Alt News kaa daawa he ki wo propaganda karne vaale un kathith patrakaron kaa pardaafaash karata he jo menstream media main apni paith bana chuke hai
 Apart from this, all kinds of rumors being published on social media are also investigated

 patrakaron ne to behad main jaakar daakuon kaa bhi intervyuu kiya, mafia or sarganaon kaa bhi
 Journalists take many risks in extracting news
 aatankwaad ke naam par sarkaron ne patrakaron par ankush lagaana shuru kar diya he
 The UK has passed a law called The Investigative Powers Act, also called the Snooper Charter
 iske tahat jasusi ke aarope main patrkaar ko 14 saal kii jail ho sakati he
 You have to tell what you talk to your source and you can go to jail on charges of leaking secret information
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki satta ke tahkhaane main kya hota he aapako ab pataa hi nahin chalegaa
 In India too, journalists are facing similar cases
 ek kissa pakistan se sunaata hum
 Journalist Cyril Almeida of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper made a news break on 9 January this year stating that the Pakistan government has clearly told its military leadership that if there is no concrete action against terrorism, then Pakistan's international fraternity There is a danger of being isolated
 is reporter ne vistaar se bataaya ki kis tarah faujee netritv ko sandesh diya gaya he ki agar sarkari agenciyaan aatanki guton ke kilaaf karrwai karti hai yaa unpar pabandi lagaati hai to usamen faujee yaa kufia agenciyaan koi dakhal nahin dengi
 Till now such a message to his powerful army was considered outside the scope of the civilian government of Pakistan
 sarkaar ne kaha ki ye galat khabar he
 But the reporter stuck to his news
 don akhbaar bhi ad gaya ki reporter kii khabar sahi he
 The editor-in-chief of the newspaper had said that the government was hastened by making the newspaper a scapegoat
 kuch or akhbaaron ne bhi is maamle main don kaa saath diya
 The government of Pakistan could not do anything for the reporter
 aap soch rahe honge ki hamane bharat se kuch udhaaharan kyon nahin diye, darasal kitna udhaaharan dete, ek ghanta kam pad jaataa or phir aap bharat ke bare main to jaanate hi honge ki media kitna swatantra he
 The Hoot has released a report on Press Freedom Day according to which 52 fatal assaults on journalists have taken place between January 16 and April 17
 grahamantralay kii report ke anusaar 2014-15 ke bich 142 hamale hue hai
 Reporting from a place like Bastar is not easy
 patrkaar police or naksal ke bich funs jaataa he
 In the midst of this battle, the journalist faces a challenge that he should also report the victimization of the tribals
 magar suraksha agenciyaan ko nishane par wo bhi aa jaataa he
 In the last two years, many journalists were sent to jail in Bastar who were bringing out similar stories
 jis din pakistan ne bhartiya sainikon ke saath barbarta kii us din ek channel or ek akhbaar ne ek khabar chhaapi ki bharat ne javaabi karrwai karte hue das pakistan sainikon ke sar kaat liye hai

 ye khabaren chhapi or logon tak pahunch bhi gayi
 Whereas the army said clearly the next day that no such incident had taken place

 bhartiya cricket team ke purv captain mohammad ajaharuddin ne un aaropon kaa khandan kiya he jisamen vinod kambli ne 1996 world cap ke bharat or srilanka ke bich khele gaye semifinal mukaable main toss jitkar pehle gendbaaji karne ke faisle par sawaal uthaae tha
 Mohammad Azharuddin reacted strongly saying that there was something wrong with Vinod Kambli's mind
 gyaat ho ki purv bhartiya cricketer vinod kambli ne vishwa cap 1996 main srilanka ke khilaaf semifinal match main ‘kuch gadabadi’ kaa andeh vyakt karte hue kaha ki tatkaaleen captain mohammad ajaharuddin ke pehle kshetrarakshan ke faisle se vah kaaphi hairaan the
 Azhar reacted to this charge and said, 'vinod Kambli is insulting the entire team by talking like this
 meri samaj main yah nahin aata ki kambli ko toss jeetne ke baad pehle ballebaaji karne ke faisle ke bare main kaise pataa tha
 Azhar, a former Indian cricketer and current Moradabad MP, insisted that no decision was taken on winning the toss and batting first
 unhone kaha, 'yah durbhagyapurna he ki ham semifinal haar gaye
 It happens in cricket
 kabhi aap jitate hai to kabhi haar kaa munh dekhnaa padataa he
 But the allegations made by Kambli are absolutely baseless
 'kambli ke bayaan par kadi pratikriya vyakt karte hue unhone kaha ki vinod ne jitne din bhi cricket khelaa uske liye unhen meraa shukraguzaar hona chahie
 Azharuddin said, Kambli is a dull man
 aisa tabhi hota he jab aap ek aise insaan ko zyada ahmiyat de baithte hai jo puri tarah shikshit yaa jisane zyada cricket nahin khelaa ho
 i would not like to talk too much about it because he too has played for the country

 kisi ko kaise vishwaas hoga ki jo sarkaar desh ke karodon logon ko apni eemaandaaree sabit karne ke liye note badalane ke liye bainkon kii linon main laga sakati he, vah desh ke sabase jimmedaar varg ko jaraa-si paardarshita ke liye prerit nahin kar sakati!jo vyavastha aam logon ke prayek kaamkaaj par nigaraanee chaahati he vah desh ke rajnatik dalon ko itnaa bhi bataane par baadhya nahin kar sakati ki aakhir unhen chanda koun detaa he?nae elactoral bond yaa rajnatik chanda coupon kii skim dekhne ke baad ham likh sakate hai ki raajnneeti agar chaalaak ho to vah avaidh ko avaidh banaae rakhane ke vaid tantra (bank) ko bich main laa sakati he
 Electoral bonds or coupons are products of this clever strategy, where banks will be used to cover up illegality
 state bank chanda coupon (1,000, 10,000, ek lakh, das lakh, ek karod rupye) bechega
 After the prescribed formalities, these can be purchased and given to political parties
 rajnatik dal 15 din ke bheetar ise bank se bhunaa lenge
 The information received from the coupon will have to be given to the political parties in their returns (income Tax and Election Commission)
 darasal, elactoral bond ek nai tarah kii karency he jiskaa istemaal keval siyaasi chande ke liye hoga
 It is important to understand why political donations are tainted in India
 yah isliye nahin ki ve nakad main die jate hai
 In 2016, in the middle of demonetisation, political parties were allowed to take a cash of Rs 2,000, which is still intact
 chande isliye vivaadit hai kyonki desh ko kabhi yah pataa nahin chalata ki koun kis rajnatik dal ko chanda de rahaa he? is coupon par bhi chanda dene vaale kaa naam nahin hoga
 This means that it is a way to facilitate political donations in its overall illegal form
 siyaasi chande ko kitni riyaayaten milti hai, aaie ginati kijiental bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ne rajnatik chande ko viypi bana diya tha
 Funding companies can exempt it from the tax by showing the expenses in their account, while donations for political parties are completely tax-free
 association of democratic ritis ke aankade bataate hai ki 2012-16 ke bich paanch pramukh partiyon ko unka 89 fisadi (945 karod rupye) chanda companiyon se mila
 This transaction is completely tax free
 congress kii sarkaar ne chande ke liye elactoral trust banane kii suvidha di, jiske jariye siyaasi dalon ko paisa diya jaataa he
 Even after demonetisation, cash donations of political parties were restored
 modi sarkaar ek or kadam aage chali gai
 In the Finance Bill 2017, the cap on political donations for companies was lifted
 isse pehle tak companiyaan apane teen saal ke shuddh laabh kaa adhiktam 7
 Only 5 per cent could be given as political donations
 companiyon ko yah na bataane kii bhi chhot mil gai ki unhone kis dal ko kitna paisa diya he
 Despite such concessions, it was still not easy to give large donations in cash
 elactoral bond se kitna bhi nakad chanda suvidhajanak ho jayega
 Cash donations will reach political accounts through bank coupons with full opacity
 sirf rajnatik dal ko yah pataa hoga ki kisne kya diya, matadaataaon ko nahin
 Electoral coupons purchased with fake identification (KYC) will help in tax-free washing of black money! This is the time to ask the government a direct question: Why should political donations get a double (company and political party) income tax concession? What public service is being done by this? What do political parties want to achieve by maintaining the confidentiality of donations? What is the harm in telling the country who is paying so much money to whom? bharat ke chunavi chande nirantar chalane vaale vittiya ghotaale hai
 It is a vast transaction that takes place through the basic institution of democracy, ie political party
 yah ek kism kaa nivesh he jo chanda lene vaale ke satta main aane par ritern detaa he
 Should we accept that no matter how popular the government is or whether the leader is popular, he will not compromise with the resolve to cover India's biggest political soot! This darkness will never end! *** trinmul congress netaa mukul royne congress main shaamil hone kii ichha jataai he or dilli main party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat bhi kii he

 ’unhone kaha, ‘kai anya partiyaan mere sampark main hai, lekin main ab bhi trinmul congress kaa sadsy hum
 State Congress leader Abdul Mannan also said that Mukul Roy had two meetings with other state Congress leaders
 donon baithken dilli or kolkata main huin

 There is a terrorist threat to this event, which is also ready to protest, the apprehension that about 60 American organizations will protest against the Trump will be a big challenge for the security personnel
 shapath grahan ke dauraan or uske baad pradarshan ke liye kareeb 30 sanghathanon ko permit mila he jo kareeb 2
 7 million people are claiming to have participated in the demonstration
 white house or capital hill kaa kaa kareeb 7 kimi varg kaa ilaaka saamaanya vaahanon ke liye band rahegaa

 The second Bible will be one that Trump's mother has gifted him
 obama ne bhi saal 2009 main shapath grahan ke liye linkan kii bible kaa istemaal kiya tha
 There is no such constitutional obligation, but most US presidents take their oaths with their hands on the Bible

 indian premier lig (ipel) ke agle sijan ke kuch match bharat se baahar ho sakate hai
 Or maybe only a few matches are in India, the rest outside, in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka
 vajah yah he ki 2014 main jab aam chunaav honge, ipel kaa samay bhi lagbhag vahi hota he
 The BCCI has started preparations from now on, so that it does not have to face trouble at the last minute
 isse pehle 2009 main bharat main aam chunaav hue the
 You will remember that all the IPL matches had to be held in South Africa
 tab ipel maichon main suraksha muhaiyaa karaane ke liye sarkaar ne manaa kar diya tha
 Although the date of the Lok Sabha elections is not yet decided, the Cricket Board does not want to take any risk
 is sarkaar kaa kaarykaal may 2014 main khatm ho jayega
 Elections will be held after this
 ipel kaa samay april-may rahata he
 In such a situation, like 2009, both programs can collide
 bisisiai ke sutron ke anusaar, haalanki puri tarah sthiti tabhi saaf ho paaegi, jab loksabhaa chunaavon kii tareekhen tay ho jaaengi
 But there is a possibility that both programs will clash
 isliye pehle se hi banglandesh or srilanka ke kikret board se sampark saadhaa ja rahaa he
 When the BCCI had to go to South Africa, the board had to bear a lot of expenses
 ab chunki rupaya kaaphi kamjor ho chukaa he to south africa main kharch or bhi bad jayega
 Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are easy to reach from both countries, so some matches can be done in both countries

 ' Bala Movie Review: jab bhari javaani main nahaate vakt bal jhadanaa shuru ho jate hai, shishe ke saamne kanghee karte vakt bal girane lag jate hai or to or aas-paas ke log aapkaa mazaaq udaane lag jate hai to ganje ho rahe us insaan kaa dard banakar ayushmaan khurana (ayushmann Khurrana) khud parde ke saamne aae hai
 Every person who lost his hair at a young age and became a victim of baldness, Ayushmann not only gave a message but also tickled fiercely
 akhbaar ke vigyaapan ko kahani main badalakar screen par pesh karne vaale diarector amar kowshik or kahanikar niren bhatta ne kya khub ukera he
 To pay tribute to every falling hair, Ayushman did not alone but all the characters of the film played well
 jaisaa ki log hameshaa kehete aaye hai ki ek hi dil he, kitni baar jeetoge ayushmaan khurana
 Something similar was seen this time too
 balmukund shukla yani ki 'bala' (bala)
 In childhood he was known for his long hair and tremendous attitude
 itnaa hi nahin, skool main kanpur ke nanhe bala (sachin Chaudhary) ladakiyon ke bich apane baalo kii style se mashhoor the
 From teachers to friends, they do not take any time to make fun of them, but the wheel of time turned so much that they were forced to be a joke
 uttar pradesh ke kanpur or lakhanu kii desi bhashaa se film shuru hoti he
 At the age of 25, Bala (ayushmann Khurrana) began to fall hair and then lost her hair
 ji haa, har samay bal girane kii vajah se 200 se zyada nuskhe apanaae, lekin phir bhi koi upaay nahin mila
 Finally had to resort to fake hair
 kaale rang kii vajah se bachapan se logon kaa taana sunati ain latikaa trivedi (bhumi Pednekar) apane classmet bala ko bich-bich main chhedati rahati
 Then comes Pari Mishra (yami Gautam), who is really a fairy for Bala's life and then the real fun of the film begins
 film kii shuruyaat main hi aap back-tu-back kanpuria chatkare or laffebaaji main ulajhna shuru ho jaaenge
 Bala means Ayushman Khurana will not give your eyes a chance to go anywhere else
 film kii actraces bhoomi pednekar or yami gautam bakhubi apane kirdaar main feet baithi hai
 Bhoomi added four moons to her dark skin look
 vahiin bala ke pita bane saurabh shukla, moochon vaali mausi latikaa kii maa seemaa pahwa or bala ke bhai bane dhirendra kumaar gautam kii acting aapkaa dil jeet legi
 From the first scene to the last scene, you will not feel like leaving the seat
 film kii kahani, dialog, screenple, mujeec or acting jabardast he
 Due to baldness, how does a person's life behave and how is he made fun of all the time
 ise aap bade parde par ayushmaan khurana ke jariye dekh sakate hai
 Of course Ayushman will win your heart once again
 aam chunaavon se thik pehle vishwa hindu parishad ne ayodhya main ram mandir kaa mudda oochaal raajnneeti ko dhruvikaran kii disha main mode diya he
 Due to which a situation of confrontation is being created between the UP government and the VHP
 is bich hamase baatcheet main singhl ne narendra modi main bhagwaan ram kii shakti or hindu samaaj ke liye bahut kuch karne vaala netaa bataaya
 According to him, Ramlala had said that the construction of the baby temple will be done by law and everyone will cooperate in it
 pesh he baatcheet ke anshaisawaal- vihip kii 84 kos kii is yatra kaa kya makasad he?jawaab- 84 kos yatra kaa nirnay farvari maheene main kumbh ke avasar par ho gaya tha
 It was discussed that the construction of Ram Janmabhoomi will be done from the Parliament itself, it is no longer a matter of court
 60 varsh ke pashchaat ye nirnay aa gaya jahaan ramalala pratishthit he vahiin ram mandir he
 What the Muslim Waqf Board was saying was that it should be declared a mosque and the mosque is built on a playground, that could not be proved
 ramalala ke mukadmaa jeetne ke baad hamako baar-baar kaha ja rahaa tha ki aap pratiksha kariye or jaise hi nirnay hoga aapke haq main faisla ho jayega
 The decision was in favor
 ab sarkaar vachanabaddh he
 The government which has acquired 70 acres of land should dedicate it to the Ramjanmabhoomi temple
 teesri baat kahi gai thi ki ayodhya kii jo saanskrithik seemaa he iske daayre main kisi prakaar kaa islamic pratik nahin banane diya jayega
 We said the same thing to the President on 30 May
 480 varshon ke baad hamane mukti pai he, is sankat se
 There were so many wars, sacrifices
 ham aage aisa nahin chaahate
 Therefore our saints decided this journey
 hamane yahi baat mulaayam singh or mukhyamantri se bhi kahi
 In two hours of talks, we did not feel that they did not want that there would be no visit, such a thing was not said anywhere
 balki hamen aisa laga ki apane adhikariyon se baat karke hamen ve iskaa samarthan karenge, sahyog karenge
 Question- Ram temple case is pending in Supreme Court, in such a situation why need to increase it? Answer- See, Parliament is the largest institution
 sansad ko hi ab nirnay karnaa padegaa
 This matter belongs to the Parliament and not to the court
 court se nirnay to aa gaya, jahaan raamalaal baithe hai, vahi ram janmabhumi he
 How long will Hindus fool the society
 aap apni party ke hinduon ko murkh bana sakate hai, lekin aap saare bharat ke hinduon ko hameshaa ke liye murkh banaaen ye ab sambhav nahin he
 For this, what is being said that the Supreme Court will decide, now the subject is to decide the Parliament
 sarkaar vachanabaddh he
 Question- It is being said that VHP is getting aggressive in 2014 elections and BJP to pursue Modi? Answer- This is the entire program of saints
 is andolan se bahut badi janashakti rambhakton ke rup main taiyaar kar rahe hai
 These Ram bhakts also want a government that can also build the Ram Janmabhoomi temple
 sant rajnatik nahin hai or na kabhi honge
 But the devotees would like to have a government in the country that enacts this law in Parliament
 kyonki mujh bada vishwaas he ki ramalala bhi kah gaye the ki baccha iskaa kanoon banegaa
 He said that its law will be made and everybody will support it
 meraa vishwaas he ki ram janmabhumi kaa vishay ye court se nirnay nahin hone vaala, sansad se hoga or sab milakar sahyog karenge
 VHP workers have met about 450 mps
 kisi ne bhi iskaa virodh nahin kiya

 Question- VHP has been vocal against Vajpayee government before, is there hope for better than Modi? Answer- Whatever the devotees would like, it will be
 aisa meraa maananaa he
 Those days are gone and changed
 sawaal- kaha ja rahaa he ki janvari ke aakhir main bijepi-viechpi-sangh kii baithak main yah khaakaa bana tha ki vikaas-hindutv ko milakar chunavi ranneeti banegi?jawaab- bhaajapa ke logon ko vichaar karne kaa vishay he
 Their manifesto has not arrived
 meraa maananaa he ki menithesto main wo tamaam bate aane vaali hai
 All these subjects will be in that manifesto
 sawaal- yatra ko anumit nahin mili to aap kya karenge?jawaab- yatra ko anumati dene ko taiyaar nahin he ye baat to saamne aa gai
 But when the yatras are to come out, the public will gather on the day and the path from which the journey is to be taken out and will undertake the march
 vahaan par sant pahunch jaaenge or yatra chalegi
 We have to see how they try to stop that journey because if thousands of people take part in the yatra, then how will these people stop it? ayodhya main rokane kii baat thi, ayodhya to simit he, lekin yatra to paanch jilon main kshetra samaaya hua he, kahaan-kahaan rokenge ye hamen
 200 saints will come every day, this post journey will not end by stopping the saints
 sawaal- teen hajaar se zyada mandir 80 pratishat jarjar, viechpi kyon nahin?jawaab- mandir rajavaade chalaaya karte the
 Rajwada ended in 1947
 uske baad centre sarkaar kii jimmevary thi
 But Hindu society is disregarded, temples are ignored, who is responsible for this
 sawaal- ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki is yatra se sampradayik sauhadrr bighad saktaa he
 Answer - There will be no communal harmony
 bahari tatv apana ullu sidhaa nahin kar sakenge
 Within this country, the Muslim wants to live in peace, he does not want to struggle, the outside elements want to sit in the middle of it and cause conflict
 sawaal- kaha ja rahaa bijepi-sangh kii ranneeti par hi vihip mandir kaa mudda uthaa yatra kar rahi he?jawaab- ye vihip or santon ke bich kii baat he
 BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on this subject
 sangh ke vishay main to main ek baat kah saktaa hum ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh shuru se hi andolan ke samarthan main rahaa he or rahegaa kyonki uski patibaddhta he is baat ke liye
 There are a large number of Sangh people in the BJP
 jo unamem gaye hai or aise karodon log jo aaj bhi samarthan karenge
 Question- vhp's relations with BJP have been very sour, you were also very vocal
 wo bijepi 10 saal pehle laachaar thi
 Atal ji had said that give us majority, he did not get majority, hence the temple could not be built
 aisa unka kahana tha
 But i believe that if he had done one thing, it would have been very good to have brought it to the House and would have gone to see if the government had gone
 ye kaam unhone nahin kiya
 Nevertheless, i believe that in this country again a majority of Ram bhaktas come to Parliament, it is our endeavor
 sawaal- to kya aapako ummid he ki modi ke netritv main agar sarkaar banati he to wo sansad main prastaav laaenge?jawaab- kyon nahin karenge
 They will not only do this much, but will do many things
 meraa maananaa he ki jab bhagwaan ram kii shakti ke rup main jab bhagwaan ne unamem pravesh kii he to kya-kya karaayenge to aap dekhte chaliye
 The kind of governance that we need here today, our head should be high in the world, such governance is needed
 wo shashan hamaare desh main kabhi nahin ban sakaa
 Let us stand among the superpowers of the world
 bane ham, aisa kabhi sochaa hi nahin gaya
 Stand with this thinking, then only change will happen
 sawaal- aapane kaha ki mulaayam-akhilesh se baatcheet main aapako nahin laga ki anumati nahin denge, to ab aap kisko jimmedaar maanate hai?jawaab- dekhie iske liye main maanata hum ki ajam khan kaa jo vaktavy aayaa he ki mulaayam singh ko ashok singhl, santon se nahin milanaa chahie tha
 i think he should not have spoken this in public
 wo unase akele main bolte to samajh main aata
 But it has opened up somewhere, now Mulayam is overturned, Azam Khan is behind him and Mulayam Singh is running from Azam and Islamic dictate, wants to crush the spirit of Hindu society, want to suppress it
 ye unki aaj kii niti ajam khan ke kaaran se ban rahi he, aisa meraa maananaa he
