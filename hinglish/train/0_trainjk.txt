 Like the administration, it has been said that the EVM machines which are shown in the video while taking off the car are 35 machines of Chandauli district which were kept in reserve
 in mashiinon ko laane-le jane kii dikkat kii vajah se ek saath nahin laayaa gaya tha
 However, as per the rules, the Reserve machine and the EVM machine from which the voting has taken place should be brought or taken together

 He has tweeted and said that such videos have come out from many areas of North India in which evms are seen being removed just before the result

 Visuals and claims of sudden movement of evms observed across the north India! Why is it so? Who is transporting these evms & Why? What is purpose and objective of this exercise? In order to avoid any confusion & misconception, Election Commission must issue a statement ASAP

 purv doorsanchaar mantri e raja or dramuk saansad kanimoi sahit 16 anya ke khilaaf aarope tay karne vaali dilli kii ek adaalat ne shanivaar ko kaha ki rishwat ke badale ayogy doorsanchaar companiyon ko 2ji spectrum aavantit karne kii sajeesh e raja ke doorsanchaar or soochna prodyogiki mantri banane ke baad shuru hui
 Special Judge OP Saini dismissed the defense's plea of no conspiracy, saying the conspiracy started after accused a Raja became the Minister of Communications and Information Technology on 16 May and following the recommendations made by TRAI on 28 August 2007 It began to become evident in August – September 2007
 nyaayadhish ne kaha ki sajeesh tab tak chali jab saat agast 2009 ko kaliganor tivi ko 50 karod rupaye rishwat ke taur par mili
 The court said that the accused in the case knew each other from the beginning, long before the conspiracy started
 adaalat ne kaha, aaropee e raja dramuk se doorsanchaar mantri the or messors kaliganor tivi privet limited ko kathith taur par iske sahyogi chalaa rahe the
 The court said, the allegations and the recorded statements show prima facie that the amount of Rs 200 crore was for the bribe of accused a Raja which was to be given in lieu of allocation of Unified Access Services License (unified Access Services License) and spectrum allocation to Swan Telecom
 And finally Kalaignar TV got it
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, aaropee vyaktiyon kaa yah kahana record ke ulat he ki aapraadhik sajeesh hone kaa koi saboot nahin he
 The court rejected the defense's contention that the CBI did not mention the conspiracy period in the chargesheet to prove prejudice against the accused
 yueyes license or spectrum ke aavanton ke saath hi mukhya sajeesh ke khatm ho jane kii daleelon ko khaarij karte hue adaalat ne kaha ki rishwat diya janaa do aaropee companiyon ko yueyes license or spectrum die jane kaa taarkik ant he or inhen alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The court also rejected the argument that even if there were a conspiracy, there would have been many conspiracies as former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behura was appointed to the Department of Telecommunications on January 1, 2008, while RTL officials Gautam Doshi, Hari Nair and Surendra Pipara swan telecom Transferred to Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka in October 2007

 nahin ain mamata, or modi kaa bengal kaa zikramamta banerjee ne sabase pehle jiesti ke is seshan main shaamil na hone kaa elaan kiya tha
 His finance minister Amit Mitra may have been attending the council meeting of GST, but he refused to attend, citing short implementation time
 modi ne apni spich main kaha- jiesti ek aisa catalist he,vyapaar main asantulan he use khatm karegaa
 The states that have been developed will also carry forward the states left behind

 The No
1 Indian team in Test rankings failed badly in the Mecca Lords of cricket in front of the British
 5 maichon kii series main bharat ab 0-2 se pichad gaya he
 The way the Indian team lost the innings in the Lord's Test has disappointed the fans
 lekin is haar se ab kai sawaal bhi uth rahe hai, sawaal uthne lajimi bhi hai
 Because big things were being done before the series started, but now this number 1 team of the Test is proving to be a booby
 viraat kohli bataur ballebaaj maujuuda samay main duniya ke sarvshereshth ballebaaj hai, lekin lords main bataur captain unki kai galtiyaan bhartiya team par baari pad gai
 For which many former cricketers have also raised questions
 1
 India has been looking for an all-rounder for a long time, questioning Hardik's selection
 lekin ye talash puri hi nahin ho rahi he
 Currently, Hardik Pandya is playing as an all-rounder in the team, but if he bases his performance, he does not live up to it at all
 mahaan cricketer sunil gavaskar ne bhi unke team main hone par sawaal khadey kar die hai
 In the Lord's Test, Hardik Pandya scored only 37 runs in both innings and then took 3 wickets
 vahiin pehle test main bhi hardik 53 ran bana paae the or unke haath koi wicket nahin laga tha
 In fact, in the last two matches, whenever batting was in trouble and needed Hardik at the crease, he failed
 2
 The first day of a fast bowler's empty Kamilords Test was completely washed out in the rain, due to which the toss was delayed
 lekin pich report ke samay sabhi purv cricketron ne kaha tha ki agar is pich par ek spinner ke saath bhi utraa jaae to acha rahegaa
 The pitch was according to the fast bowlers, yet a bowler like Umesh Yadav was not fed
 lords main eshanth, hardik or shami ko wicket mili, uske alaava england kii jeet ke kaaran bhi tej gendbaaj hi rahe
 3
 kyon nahin mila ek adhik ballebaaj ko mauka?abhi tak donon test main bhartiya ballebaaji puri tarah se fail rahi he
 Skipping Virat Kohli's innings of 149 runs, no major impact has been seen so far
 ballebaajon ke halaat ko dekhte hue agar team india ne lords test main team main ek adhik ballebaaj ke saath utarati to shaayad vah phydemand ho saktaa tha
 In the second Test, there was a change in the team, in which the spinner was given a chance which was probably not the right decision in any way
 4
 Is negligence heavy? Team India's performance is constantly raising questions
 purv cricketron se lekar cricket ke jaankaar tak har koi team management ko aade haathon le rahaa he
 The Indian team played just one practice match before the start of the Test series, as they needed 5 days off
 or jo ek practice match khelaa vah bhi sirf 3 din kaa
 In such a situation, this negligence of Team India is being criticized on social media too
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne aaj (shuukravaar) ko ek kaarykram kaha ki notebandi se pehle bhrashtachariyon ko taiyaari kaa mauka nahin mila
 If given a chance, he too would have praised the move

 gauratlab he ki notebandi ko lekar sansad ke donon sadanon main hangaamaa ho rahaa he
 The Opposition is constantly demanding PM Modi's statement regarding demonetisation, while the government says that only the Finance Minister will reply to this

 PM Modi said that the issue is not that the government did not make complete preparations, the pain is that the government did not give them time to prepare
 72 ghante bhi taiyaari ko milte to bolte modi jaisaa koi nahin
 Significantly, there is a ruckus in both houses of Parliament over demonetisation
 vipaksh lagaataar notebandi ko lekar piem modi ke bayaan kii maang kar rahaa he, jabaki sarkaar kaa kahana he ki is par vittamantri hi jawaab denge

 It is not a matter of whether or not anyone apologized
 baat isaki he ki kuch to hamaare aas paas ho rahaa he jise lekar ham zarurat se zyada saamaanya hote ja rahe hai
 Normally in such a way that we are going to fight with each other about putting a loudspeaker and if there is a procession of Tajiya, and the whole matter is made a question of law and order and it is confined to a political party versus the state government
 ham is had tak saamaanya ho chuke hai ki ham sweekaar karne lage hai ki chunaav kaa samay he to is us samudaay ke bich tanaav hoga hi
 Dangerous is not the behavior or statement of any MP, it is dangerous that we become normal about such things
 dinabhar tivi par aapane is video ko dekha hi hoga
 In this, an MP is putting bread in the mouth of an employee
 ye janaab thane se shivasena ke saansad hai, rajan vichaare or jiske munh main roti thunsi ja rahi he, wo hai arshad zubair, maharashtra sadan main iarsitisi ke racident manager
 Arshad says that doing so broke his fast ahead of time
 ek saansad kaa yah vyavhaar kya aapako narmal laga
 Have you given the right to an MP, apart from voting, that if he gets angry, put someone in the mouth or smash a policeman after getting on the traffic
 par aap narmal na hote to is sansad main bhi 34 pratishat aise saansadon ko na chunate jinpar kisi na kisi prakaar ke aapraadhik aarope lage hai
 Not only serious charges like murder, but 420 cases of Rajan Vichara are also registered
 thane ke purv meyar rah chuke vichaare kii website se pataa chalaa ki raashtrapati kalam ne unhen neshnal energy award bhi diya he
 Shiv Sena MP Rajan Vichare said that Maharashtra had already complained about bad food and water in the House, but there was no improvement for two months
 hamane jaanboojhkar aisa nahin kiya na hi khaane ke liye baadhya kiya
 It is not good to play sensitive pictures in the loop again and again
 isse aapke andar kaa aakrosh bhadak saktaa he, isliye ham is hisse main video kii jagah tasviir se dikhaa rahe hai ki kya vaaki khaane ke liye majaboor nahin kiya rajan ne
 But even the picture is a testimony to the tilt
 rajan ne kaha ki unhone roti todi nahin
 But in this picture, another MP is pulling bread and telling how tough it has become
 kai channelon par yah khabar kisi gumnaam ek angreji akhbaar ke hawaale se chal rahi hogi
 Today the newspaper in which this news appeared is named The Indian Express and the reporter is Dipankar Ghosh
 is puure vivaad main sanyam kaa saath kabhi nahin chhodana chahie or ek mauka is baat ko bhi dena chahie ki ho saktaa he ki gusse main saansad mahoday ko dhyaan hi na rahaa ho ki saamne vaala arshad he or uskaa roza he
 Even if you believe this, you cannot insist that the MP has the right to do so with an employee
 agar saansad mahoday sirf gusse kaa maamla samaj kar bhi maafee maang lete to kya is gusse ko lekar saansad mahoday ko afsos nahin karnaa chahie
 This is not even a matter of religion
 vaise arshad ne kaha, 'maine apni vardi pahani hui thi
 My name was also written on it
 saare log meraa naam bhi jaanate the
 Because of this my fast is broken
 ' Sanjay Raut said that no one would have written on his forehead what religion he belonged to
 yah andolan kaa tarika tha
 Now you have two options
 yaa to andolan ke is tareeke ko sweekaar kar len yaa phir aap unki ye baat maan len ki kisi ke maathe par dharm nahin likhaa hota
 By the way, the name was written on the uniform, so the leaders who come to such houses identify their employees by name or not
 arshad to racident manager he or manager kaa naam pataa hota he
 Arshad, an employee of IRCTC, definitely complained about this matter
 ye alag baat he ki ghatana ke saat dinon ke baad bhi koi karrwai nahin hui
 According to the Indian Express, IRCTC stopped all its operations within a few hours of the incident
 maharashtra ke racident kamishnar se likhit shikaayat kii ki unka ek karmchaaree arshad zubair gambhir rup se aahat or dukhi he kyonki isse dharmik bhaavana judi he
 The Resident Commissioner also apologized to IRCTC and Arshad
 17 july ko apane email main iarsitisi ke dipti manager ne likhaa ki aaj 12−15 saansadon kii new maharashtra sadan main baithak hui
 They were complaining about electricity, civil and cleanliness and eating and drinking
 puraa delygation jisamen electronic media bhi shaamil tha, maharashtra sadan ke public dining haul main ghus aayaa or bufe aria main bartanon ke dhakkanon ko uthaakar phenkane laga
 Threatened to beat up employees and used profane language
 arshad ko puri chapatti khaane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya jabaki wo roze par tha
 On one channel we saw that the mps were not throwing lids in the buffet area, but were looking up
 ab sawaal he ki kya is ghatana ke vakt yaa baad main shivasena ke saansadon ne arshad se koi khed jataayaa
 While BJP leaders were apologizing more than Shiv Sena
 shivasena ne khulkar maafee nahin maangi na khed jataayaa
 On the contrary, he started accusing that he was being defamed
 is bich buudhvaar ko loksabhaa main ek or vakya ho gaya jab bijepi ke ek saansad vidhudi or ovaisi ke bich bahes ho gai or vidhudi ji ne kuch abhadra baaten kah deen
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Vekaiah Naidu also said strictly that the party does not recognize such behavior
 spikar or vekainya ke kehane par vidhudi ko maafee bhi maangani padi
 We will just ask that what kind of political culture is this, where anything from Ashok Singhal to Praniv Togadia and Owaisi brothers speak
 inaki baton ke peeche log jamaa ho jate hai or ek duusare ke khilaaf kuch bhi bolne lagate hai
 We have all come here, crossing all the limits of being normal, and now we feel proud while being inversely secular
 prime time
 The Law Commission has submitted a report to the government on Tuesday, recommending that Hindu law should be amended, so that the daughter-in-law can also have rights over her father-in-law's property
 agar pati guzaara-bhatta de paane main asamarth he to vah bhatta sasuraal vaale mahila ko den
 The existing provisions do not entitle a woman to claim alimony from her in-laws in the event of her husband's physical or mental incapacity, missing, separation or other reasons
 kanoon mantri sadanand gauda ke saamne prastut report main ayog ne kaha, 'jis hindu mahila kaa pati guzaara bhatta dene main asamarth he, uske adhikaron kii raksha honi chahie
 According to the panel, under section 4 of section 18, 'where the husband is physically, mentally, leaving the wife, missing or for any reason unable to pay alimony to the wife, then the Hindu wife has the right to take allowance from the joint Hindu family Should be received and that allowance will be separate from the share in the husband's property
 'yah sifarish kii gai ki ab hindu adopshan and mentanence act 1956 main badlaav kiya jaae
 If the husband has already taken part in the property from the family, then in that case the wife will get only the allowance and not the property
 panel ne kaha ki pehle pati kii ore se guzaara bhatta na de paane par patni ke paas sampatti main hissaa paane ke liye court ke anginat chakkar lagane ke alaava koi upaay nahin tha, yah prakriya bahut lambii bhi thi
 Let me tell you that this issue came to the Commission through the Punjab and Haryana High Court last year, where the wife of a mentally incapacitated husband had asked for a share in the property so that she can live, husband and child Could maintain ek samjhaute ke tahat use hissaa to mila, lekin susaraal waalon ne baad main use sampatti se vanchit kar diya
 The matter had then reached the High Court
 hockey khilaadi sandip singh se baatcheet-goli lagane se aapako lakva maar gaya tha lekin thik hokar aap phir bhartiya hockey team ke captain bane
 What was your reaction when co-producer Deepak Singh approached to make a film on your life? i was overwhelmed
 mujhe laga ki meri asal jindagi par film bani to vah har yuva ko prerit karegi
 Even if he is not interested in sports

 When the doctors said that now i would not be able to walk or play hockey, i asked them to step out of my eyes

 i knew that my place was in a hockey arena, not a wheelchair
 aap shuru se hi chaahate the ki lead role dilajit dosanjh karen
 Although initially he did not show much interest
 main nahin chahta tha ki ek sikh kaa kirdaar koi uthle dhang se kar daale
 i felt that Diljit would be able to do it well
 lekin unhen bharosa na tha ki ek hockey player or uski training vagairah ko ve thik se nibhaa paaenge
 But after listening to the script, he did not want to miss this opportunity
 pichley das saal main khiladinnon kii jindagi par kai filmein bani hai

 *** 11 march 2017 ko uttar pradesh samet 5 rajyon main chunaav nateezon ke baad bhartiya share bazaar tees hajaari kii raftaar pakadaney laga
 Market experts believed that the results of other states, including UP, gave investors confidence in most states to form the BJP government
 in nateezon se niveshkon kii ummid badi ki desh main aarthik sudhaaron kii raftaar badhegi or nivesh kaa maahaul sudharega
 Therefore, it was speculated that once again the stock market will hold the trend of may-june 2014 and the Sensex will cross the magical figure of 30,000 and Nifty 10,000
 8 march ko aakhri phej kii poling ke dinshere bazaar kaa sensotive index sensex29,000 ke neeche kaarobaar kar rahaa tha
 In the exit poll results of the evening of March 8, the stock market gained momentum from March 9 on the bjp's hopes of victory
 vahiin 11 march ko aae nateezon ke baad ke kaarobaari satron main sensex 30,000 ke aankade kii taraf bhaagane laga or hafte ke aakhri kaarobaari satr 17 march ko sansex 29,650 ankon ke str ko paar kar gaya
 On March 18, Yogi Aditya Nath was declared the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh
 is ghoshnaa ke baad somvaar 20 march ke pehle karobaari din share bazaar main giravat laut ai
 Sensex sitting at 29,650 on 17 March, fell more than 125 points on 20 March
 vahiin agle kaarobaari din mangalvaar ko ek baar phir din ke kaarobaar main giravat ke baad buudhvaar 22 march ko sensex 250 ankon kii giravat ke saath 29,250 ke str par kaarobaar kar rahaa he
 In the current trading week, where the experts are holding the global market responsible for the ongoing decline, but it is clear from the statistics that Modi's magic is on the Indian stock market
 bazaar main utaar-chadhaav ke gharelu kaarnon main jahaan uttar pradesh main bijepi kii jeet se niveshkon ke centement main sudhaar dekhne ko mila vahiin yogi ko mukhyamantri kaa pad die jane kii ghoshnaa kaa asar bazaar par nahin padaa or vaishvik dabaav main bazaar ne giravat kaa rukh kar liya
 The video has gone viral while voting for Congress candidate Vasram Sagathia in Gujarat elections
 vasaram rajkot gramin se pratyaashee hai or jab ve vot daal rahe the tab unke peeche ek shaks unka video bana rahaa tha
 This can become a matter of violation of voting secrecy
 video saamne aane ke baad isaki jaanch bhi shuru kar di gai he
 Significantly, votes are being cast in 89 seats in Gujarat today
 rajkot kii 8 vidhansabha siton par bhi aaj voting he
 Congress has given ticket to Vasram Sagathia from Rajkot Rural where he is contesting against BJP candidate Lakhabhai Sagathia
 ye seat anusuchit jati ke liye arakshit he
 During the voting, when Vasaram Sagathia was voting on EVM, a man was standing behind him and making a video from his mobile
 pehali najar main dekhne main lag rahaa he ki ye sab sagathia kii jaankaree main ho rahaa tha
 But someone present there made a video of the whole incident and uploaded it on social media
 ye video saamne aane ke baad prashasan bhi harakat main aayaa
 District Election Officer Vikrant Pandey has ordered an inquiry into the entire matter
 gauratlab he ki matdaan puri tarah se gopneey rakhaa jaataa he taaki koi doosraa ye pataa na laga sake ki kis vyakti ne kis party yaa pratyaashee ko vot diya he lekin is tarah ke video se ye gopneeyata bhang hone kaa maamla ban saktaa he
 If this happens, then Congress candidates may be in trouble
 bharat ke purv dhuandhar salaami ballebaaj virender sahvaag ne bhartiya cricket ke itihaas main kai yaadgaar paariyaan kheli hai, or sanyas ke baad bhi ye silsilaa jari rakhane ke makasad se unhone ek nai saajhedaari kii shuruyaat kii he
 He has tied up with the country's renowned sports and entertainment management company Dunamis Sports for brand advertising and public roles

 This style of Veeru has made him a role model in real sense, due to which Dunamis Sporting has also come with him
 company ke paas pehle se ek or dhamaakedaar khilaadi kris gail maujuud he, or viru ke saath aane se ab ye team or bhi bejod ban gai he
 Announcing his arrival with Sehwag, Dunamis CEO Abhishek Mishra said, "veeru is one of the most famous cricketers in the country
 ve ek shandaar ballebaaj rahe hai or aaj bhi unke paas maujuuda khilaadiyon ke mukaable kahin zyada vigyaapan hai
 This confirms his evergreen popularity
 ’abhishek ke mutabik dunamis khilaadiyon or hastiyon ke prabandhan main desh kii sabase teji se ubhar rahi company he or viru ke saath aane se ye baat sabit ho gai he
 Sehwag also expressed happiness in his own style, saying, 'I hope for a long and wonderful partnership
 dunamis ek behtareen company he, jisamen daksh karmchaariyon kii bharmaar he
 i am very sure that instead of taking one or two runs here, we will hit fours and sixes
 ’haal hi main sahvaag sharajah main shuru hui ten premier lig ke brands ambeseder bane hai
 Sehwag played 23 Test centuries in his cricket career, including two triple centuries and four double centuries
 khel ke maidan main apni duusari pari main bhi sahvaag ne ek camentator ke taur par apni alag pahchaan banaai he
 Sehwag is becoming very popular on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter due to his outspoken and honest manner
 ab jab dunamis jaisi diggaj company bhi viru ke saath jud gai he, to phens ummid kar sakate hai ki unke chahete khilaadi kaa or behatar andaaj or avatar unhen dekhne ko milegaa

 a political storm has arisen within the Congress on the reply given by the Forest Minister of Madhya Pradesh Umang Singhar to the Narmada plantation
 diggi raja ne vanmantri ko naseehat di to mantri ne palatwaar karte hue digvijay ko chitthee likhakar unke bete kii galati par chup rahane par sawaal khadey kar die
 It is clear that Umang Singhar, the forest minister in the 2-month-old Kamal Nath government, has taken a direct fight with Digvijay Singh, which has given the BJP a chance to crack up
 darasal, madhya pradesh vidhansabha main narmada kinare paudharopan ko lekar vanmantri umang singhar ke jawaab ke baad uthaa vivaad abhi thanda bhi nahin hua tha ki ab satta or sanghathan ke bich kii ladaai duniya ke saamne aa gai he
 Let me tell you that in response to the question asked by the Forest Minister Umang Singhar about plantation of Narmada shore, there was no embezzlement in it, but Digvijay Singh denied Umang Singhar's answer and asked that Narmada shore was On this how many kilometers have been walked? On this, the Forest Minister Singhar retorted and wrote a letter to Digvijay Singh
 singhar ne isamen kaha ki media main bayaan dene se pehle aapako mujhase charchaa karnaa chahie thi
 You read the statement in the media without reading, while your son and Urban Development Minister Jayawardhan Singh gave a clean chit to the department in Simhastha scam in response to a question
 singhar ne digvijay ko naseehat dete hue kaha ki aapako sabhi ke saath nyaay karnaa chahie or pradesh main party kaise majboot ho iske liye sochna chahie
 Through his letter, Forest Minister Umang Singhar not only objected to Digvijay's statement but also exhorted him that you did not say anything to give a clean chit to your son Jayavardhan in the Simhastha scam while you should do justice to all
 vahiin sinhasth ghotaale par jayavardhan singh ne kaha ki jab unke vibhaag ke paas sinhasth se judi fil hi nahin ai to aise main clinit kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Jayawardhan Singh said that the report that has not come in my department is still in the General Administration Department, so that question was not from my department

 The BJP took a dig at Digvijay Singh's son-in-law and said that Diggi Raja scolded the sons of Adivasis and the poor, but did not say anything to his son for the same mistake
 bijepi ke pradesh upaadhyaksh rameshwar sharma ne kaha ki 'digvijay singh ke andar jo rajshahi he vah barkaraar he or raja jis tareeke se garibon ko hukum sunaate rahete hai usee tareeke se unhone do adivasee chehron ko nishaanaa banaaya or unako daant lagaai
 While the reply of the Forest Minister is absolutely correct, he said that Jayawardhan would have felt the same scolding
 saarvajanik taur par yah raja rajavaade garibon kaa apmaan karte rahe hai kisaan mazdooron kaa apmaan karte rahe hai
 They still do not see the Forest Minister and Home Minister, they see Bala Bachchan and Umang Singhar and Digvijay Singh is scolding them in the same language
 unhone kaha ki digvijay singh ko yah samaj lenaa chahie loktantr bad gaya or rajshahi khatm ho gai he
 If you learn to scold, learn from the frame of the house, do not scold the sons of the poor
 vahiin bijepi vidhayak vishwaas saarang ne kaha ki 'umang singhar to kah rahe hai ki main yadi digvijay singh kaa betaa nahin hum
 If i am a tribal, if i am not born to King Maharaja, will i be scolded? bala bachchan adivasee he to unhen danta jayega lekin kisi raja maharaja ke bete ko nahin danta jayega kya?aapako bataa den ki vidhansabha ke is satr main mandsaur golicond, vyaapman or narmada kinare paudharopan ko lekar sarkaar ke javaav se congress lagaataar baikfoot par he

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has won two ICC World Cup titles for India, has broken his silence on IPL spot fixing
 chaahe vah maidan ke andar ho yaa phir maidan ke baahar, dhoni hameshaa sanyam se pesh aate rahe hai
 Even after being dragged into IPL spot-fixing, Dhoni did something similar
 justise mukul mudgal kii jaanch report main emes dhoni kaa naam hone ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe the
 In such a situation, the captain of Team India was asked many times on spot-fixing, but on most occasions he thought it better to remain silent
 spot phixing par supreme court ke faisle ke baad maahi ne apana paksh rakhaa he
 Before the crucial match against Australia, Dhoni said that whenever something happens in Indian cricket, his name has been dragged on
 captain ne yah bhi kaha ki ab sari baaten khatm ho chuki hai, lekin phir kahin na kahin se unka naam kisi maamle main ghasita jayega, jisaki unhen aadat ho chuki he
 It is clear from Dhoni's statement how difficult it is to be the captain of Team India
 dhoni ne kaha ki agar kuch nahin ho, to koi apane man se kahani banaakar usamen unka naam shaamil kar detaa he or unhen aisi baton ke saath jeene kii aadat ho gai he
 It has been almost a decade since Dhoni played cricket for India
 aise main unka daaman bhale hi paak rahaa ho, lekin ipel spot phixing maamla unke liye ek kadavi yaad bana rahegaa
 When US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi met at dinner last Monday, they shared personal stories and experiences
 iske saath hi donon netaaon ne nijee taur par ghanishtataa bana lee
 The meeting between the two leaders lasted for about 90 minutes and during this time they became so good that President Obama went with Modi to the memorial of Martin Luther King Jr
 despite a busy schedule
 white house ke rashtriya suraksha parishad ke varisht nideshak phil rainer ne kaha, ‘aap is daure kii duusari kai baton par gaur kar sakate hai
 The visit exemplifies the personal level of communication between the two
 ’ unhone videsh samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘sachai he ki america ke raashtrapati bharat ke pradhanmantri ke saath martin luther king smarak gaye
 This is a sign of how comfortable they were with each other
 'rainer ne kaha, dinar ke samay bhi raashtrapati ne puraani yaadon kaa zikr kiya jab vah apane parivaar ke saath bharat gaye the
 i believe that there was some discussion about how fun the tour of India was and they also danced there
 yah bahut garmjoshi vaala kshan tha
 i think the Prime Minister mentioned the time when he came to Washington DC a few years ago
 ’ modi or obama ne ek duusare ke saath kai kahaniyaan bhi saajha kii
 He said, 'perhaps the most talked about was how his experience was when he first came to government
 unhone sweekaar kiya ki sarkaar main praudyogiki ke saath bahut kuch kiya ja saktaa he
 ' bhale hi aap kitne hi achche kyon na hon, aap ke andar sari khubiyaan hon lekin agar aapkaa pehla impressant kharaab he to aapako lekar galat raay banaayi ja sakati he
 In such a situation, it is very important that if you are going to meet someone for the first time, then do not do anything that will make your first impression wrong
 kai baar pehali date par ladke kuch aisa kar dete hai jisase ladki ke saamne unki galat chhavi ban jaati he
 In such a situation, keeping these small things in mind, you can avoid any such situation: 1
 agar aap date par ja rahe hai to sirf apane hi bare main baat na karen
 The scope of the talks should be such that the person sitting in front can talk something
 ramakahani sunaane kii jagah saamne vaale ko bhi bolne kaa puraa mauka dijie
 2
 mobile ham sabaki zarurat ban chuki he par agar aap kisi ke saath date par gaye hue hai to baar-baar mobile check karnaa yaa ghadi-ghadi mobile par baat karnaa aapkaa impressant kharaab kar saktaa he
 3
 date par shaleen baaten hi karen
 Joking is also good, but talking about sex on the first date or telling a bad joke can ruin your impression
 4
 Going on a date, your attention should be on the person sitting in front
 kisi ke saamne hote hue kisi duusari ladki ko ghoorna aapke vyaktitv par sawaal khadaa kar saktaa he
 5
 kisi kii galtiyaan bataanaa buree baat nahin he lekin har kaam samay or jagah ke mutabik kiya janaa chahie
 This is not the place where you tell the person sitting in front of his mistakes
 6
 Talking about and appreciating your past relationships
 bhuulakar bhi aisa kuch na karen varanaa aapkaa yerishta shuru hone se pehle hi shaq ke ghere main aa jayega
 CMS founder Jagdish Gandhi was also present at the event along with the Union Minister
 iske pehle kanpur main media se baatcheet main puri ne kaha ki jo log vayusena se pakistan main hamalaa kiye jane ke saboot maang rahe hai ve deshadrohi hai
 He said that Pakistan itself believes that there was an air strike in it
 kisi vyakti yaa dal kii bhaajapa netaaon or pradhanmantri narendra modi se dushmani ho sakati he lekin desh se nahin honi chahie
 It should not be played with the identity of the country
 saath hi puri ne kaha kii vaayu sena ke jaanbaaj abhinandan ne varsh 1960 main bane mig-21 vimaan se pakistan ke vimaan ko maar giraaya
 This is not a simple matter
 pakistan ne abhinandan ko yun hi nahin choda balki geneva sandhi ke tahat aisa kiya gaya
 Let me tell you, the CRPF convoy was attacked in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir
 hamale main siarpief ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 After this, the Indian Air Force entered Pakistan and attacked the bases of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 isamen baari sankhya main aatankiyon ke maare jane kii reports ai thim
 After this strike, Pakistan Air Force crossed the Indian border and dropped bombs here
 iske baad bhartiya vayusena ke wing commander abhinandan vardhaman ne pakistani vimaanon kaa peechha karte hue khaded diya
 But in a fight with a Pakistani aircraft, he went across the border, where his plane became the target of the Pak Army
 iske baad vah bhartiya payalat abhinandan ko pakistan ne giraftaar kar liya
 However, Pakistan later released Abhinandan and handed over to India

 After this, the entire Lashkar of goons and miscreants with sticks and sticks broke on these people
 yuvakon ke saath berahami kii sari hadein paar kar di gayi
 First, by planting the young man with a tree, two young men held his hands and then started lathi-sticks on him
 ek ke baad ek danda se tabadatod waar hote rahe
 The young man kept shouting, pleading, begging for mercy, but where was the heart of these executioners going to sweat, they kept beating, beating and just beating him like an animal
 jab ped se baandhakar peetane ke baad in jallaadon kaa man bhar gaya to use gamche se jameen par giraakar phir peeta jane laga
 Lathi-poles were raining with hands and there was a shower of abuse from the mouth
 jiskaa jaise man aayaa, usne vaise peeta
 He, who did not have poles in his hands, showered the kick
 ek ko jab peet-petakar adhamra kar diya to number duusare kaa aayaa
 He was treated the same way
 dhire-dhire in gundon kii taadaad badhati gai or pitane vaale inke haathon pitate rahe
 The other person was also beaten fiercely
 yahi nahin in gundon ne mahila ko bhi nahin bakhsha or uske saathiyon ke haathon hi us par chappal chalavaai
 These people also forcibly raised slogans of Jai Shri Ram
 goraksha ke naam par pitayee kaa ye video do-teen din purana he, lekin iske viral hone ke baad police harakat main ai or maamle main karrwai karte hue ek aaropee ko giraftaar bhi kar liya
 The war of words between North Korea and America has come to such a level that the heads of the two countries have started fighting like children
 nae saal par america ko dhamkaate hue north korea ke taanashaah kim jong un ne kaha tha ki unke parmaanu hathiyaar ab america ke kisi bhi shahar tak pahunch sakate hai or uskaa batan uski teble par rahata he
 So in response to this, US President Donald Trump threatened Kim that he has this button and it is not only bigger than his button but also more powerful
 phir shuru hui trump or kim kii zubaani jang!uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong un ne elaan kiya 'puraa america hamaare parmaanu hathiyaaron kii jad main hai or newclear batan hameshaa meri desk par hota he
 US President Donald Trump said, "I have a bigger and stronger nuclear button than you, and it works too
" ' kim jong un ke parmaanu batan ke jabaab main donald trump kaa usase bhi bada 'batan' saamne aayaa he
 The US President has given a provocative statement to Kim
 trump ne kaha 'mere paas tumse bada or taqatvar newclear batan he
 'kim and Trump will be responsible for the Third World War! If the heads of two countries armed with atomic bombs start quarreling in this way, then you yourself guess what will be the outcome
 kehane kaa matlab ye he ki aise bayanon se kya newclear war ke khatm hone or shanti ke kaayam hone kii ummid kya kii ja sakati he
 If not, should the world wait for the world war
 lekin agar duniya par sankat ke badal chaa jaaen to uske zimmedaar yahi do log honge
 One of these is what the world calls the dictator and the only purpose of his life is to make so many nuclear weapons that the US can destroy and ruin it
 or duusari taraf wo he jise duniya kaa sabase taqatvar raashtrapati kaha jaataa he or uski bhi zindagi kaa maqasad he kim jong un barbaad karnaa he
 But the way the two are bombarding each other with their statements, it seems that this is a personal war between them
 lekin ye yakeen maniye ki jang hui to ye sirf in donon main nahin hogi balki isaki jad main tamaam duniya aa jaaegi
 Kim's threats tell you that this statement by US President Donald Trump is a response to North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong Un's address to the nation on the New Year, in which he said that the whole of America lives in the ranks of its nuclear weapons and the nuclear button On the table
 kim ke isi bayaan ke jawaab main raashtrapati trump ne ek twit kar palatwaar kiya he
 Trump's answer to US President Donald Trump said "north Korean leader Kim Jong Un has just said that the atomic bomb button is always on his desk
" kya uske khatm ho chuke or bhukhmaree se pareshaan rajya se koi use batayega ki parmaanu bam kaa batan mere paas bhi he
 And it is bigger and stronger than its bomb, my button also works
 'trump ne garmaaya maahaulatasawwur kiijie ki do desh parmaanu bamon kii dhamkee jis chote or bade batan ke andaaz main de rahe hai, wo kitni ghaatak he
 However, in his statement, the North Korean dictator definitely said that he wants peace and will not use nuclear power unless there is a war against America
 magar shanti kii koshish karne ke bajaae america raashtrapati ne apane is nae bayaan se is maamle ko or zyaada garma diya he
 Accountants for world peace believe that this attitude of the heads of the two countries is not only a threat to world peace but can also prove to be fatal
 aapako bataa den ki trump or kim ke in bayanon main ye garmi uttar korea kii us hwasong-15 missile ke test ke baad ai he jisaki maarak kshamta 13 hazaar kimi he
 That is, this missile can hit any city of America
 iske safal pareekshan ke baad se jahaan kim ke parmaanu kaarykram main teji aa gai vahiin america kii chintaaen bad gai hai

 But it was not written in the last document
 tab shastri ne ayyub khan se poocha ki unhone apni pramukh shart kyon saaf-saaf nahin rakhi? tab ayyub ko ise apane haath se likhnaa padaa
 Before his death under mysterious circumstances in 1966, the scribes in Moscow were upset that the agreement had been signed, but the media and politicians were unhappy with why two important posts were handed over to Pakistan? Most people felt that they had succumbed to the pressure of Russia
 jis raat unki maut hui, main kaaphi der tak unke saath tha
 Shortly after returning to my room, a Russian lady said that your Prime Minister was dying
 jab tak main dcha pahunchaa, ve chirnidra main leen ho chuke the
 i was the last person to meet him and see him alive

 Jha told reporters here after the film was released in Uttar Pradesh today after the Supreme Court's direction was cleared, that the film's initial ban on screening in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh based on a vivid and sensitive issue like reservation Did have a bad effect but eventually he managed his cause
 anna ke andolan par vishesh kaverejunhone kaha, ‘meraa makasad puraa hua

 The filmmaker, known for making films on social issues, said that the film's release in Uttar Pradesh was unfortunate and the decision was taken in response, but he did not want to blame anyone for it

 toyota Etios Liva kaa ye khaas adishan bharat main launch, jaane khubiyaan When a country gives up respect for the sovereignty of other countries in the whims of its power, it becomes like China and Pakistan
 ye donon padosi desh ab bharat ke khilaaf ekajute ho gaye hai
 China has prepared a blue print of twenty years for this, which has been leaked
 is blue print ke tahat china dhire-dhire pakistan ke sansadhano ko apane niyantran main le legaa
 Its purpose behind this is to surround India from all sides
 20 saal kaa china-pakistan aarthik galiyara (sipiisi) blue print bharat kii gardan par chadh baithne ko taiyaar kiya gaya he
 You would not even know to what extent Pakistan has been falling to counter China's 20-year plan
 vah bharat ke khilaaf apni samprabhutaa se bhi samjhauta kar rahaa he
 China is also taking advantage of this and systematically enslaving Pakistan
 sipiisi kaa bees saal kaa blue print bharat ke liye bahut badi chintaa kaa sabab isliye bhi he ki china bahut aakraamak tareeke se ise anjaam de rahaa he
 China has made clear its intentions by laying a network of roads in Pakistan occupied Kashmir under the One Belt One Road Policy
 pakistan ne china ko khuli chhot de di he ki vah vahaan aae or jo marji ho kare
 Pakistan has reached such a disastrous way that it is not in a position to do anything
 china ne pakistan main aarthik investment bahut zyada badha diya he
 India needs to be aware of this
 yah he blue print* pakistan 6500 acre jameen chini companiyon ko patte par de rahaa he

 China is increasing its penetration there, just like Tibet
 pakistan ko china hajam kar legaa
 India has to strengthen itself
 changyong institute of phinantial studies ne apni aantarik report main kaha he ki sipiisi yojana upmahadweep main dher sari mushkilon ko paravaanaa sabit hogi
 It has pointed to difficulties like terrorism, Cold War situation in Pakistan and insurgency in Balochistan, but China and Pakistan have advanced so far on the path that there is no option left
 bharat ke kaan khadey hone ke liye itnaa kaaphi he ki aane vaale dinon main china pakistan ko gulam bana legaa
 china-pakistan china-pakistan buoyed by India's rising steps has so much resented the increasing dominance of India that together they are ready to do anything
 iske tahat pakistan ne agle 23 saal tak esaijed se chalane vaali chini companiyon ke tex maaf kar die hai
 In Gwadar, Balochistan, China has sat down by making a port
 pakistan dikhaanaa chahta he ki yah uski kaarobaari saajhedaari he, lekin asal main yah samrik ghuspaith kii taiyaari he

 daaud ibrahim kii pakistan main kathith maujuudagi mangalvaar ko sansad or uske baahar bhi charchaaon kaa vishay bani rahi
 First a Minister of State for Home Affairs made a controversial statement, then another Minister of State for Home Affairs came in for Damage Control and took a U-turn saying that the government believes that Dawood is still in Pakistan
 darasal yah vivaad shuru hua grih rajyamantri haribhaai choudhary ke us bayaan se, jisamen unhone daaud ke thikaane ke bare main koi jaankaree na hone kii baat kahi thi
 This caused a ruckus and the opposition started besieging the Modi government reminding them of their old promises
 iske baad grih rajya mantri kiran rigiju saamne aae or you-turn lete hue unhone kaha, 'sarkaar maanati he ki vah (daaud) pakistan main hi he
 '"he's in Pak" says Kiren Rijiju (mos, Home) on being asked about # Dawoodhttps: / / t
 co / ee6xlnoaxj— ANI (@ani_news)may 5, 2015khabar aa rahi he ki abadaud ibrahim ke thikaaneke bare main kendriya grih mantralay buudhvaar ko sansad main safai de saktaa he
 According to intelligence agencies, details of the three passports of Dawood Ibrahim and information of the three addresses have been shared with Pakistan
 ham kyon bol rahe pakistan kii aawaaj?: congressudhar vipaksh ne is mudde par centre sarkaar ko aade haathon lenaa shuru kar diya he
 Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi said, 'we are surprised to see the government's written reply in Parliament in which they said that we have no information about Dawood
 yah grih rajyamantri kiran rigiju ke disambar 2014 main die gaye bayaan ke bilkul ulat he
 Then he said that the government knows Dawood's address
 'gaurav gogai ne kaha, 'chunaav campan main bhi modi ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri banane ke baad vah daaud ko lekar aaenge
 But the government's answer comes from the official stand of Pakistan
 ham pakistan kii aawaaj kyon bolne lage hai?'grih rajya mantri ne diya tha vivaadaaspad bayanakreeb paanch maheene pehle anderworld dondood ibrahimaki giraftaar or karachi main thikaane ke babat grih mantri ne kaha tha, 'pratiksha kiijie'
 But it is sad that now the government has dragged its hands and feet back in this whole matter
 grih rajyamantri haribhaai ne loksabhaa main kaha he ki sarkaar ko nahin pataa daaud ibrahim kahaan he
 Till now there were reports that Dawood is hiding in the Pakistani city of Karachi
 lekin pehali baar sarkaar ne kaha he ki daaud kahaan he isaki use khabar nahin he
 Minister of State for Home Haribhai Parati Bhai Chaudhary said in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that Dawood has not been detected yet
 sarkaar nahin jaanati ki wo kahaan he or pratyrpan kii prakriya tabhi shuru ho sakati he, jab uskaa pataa chale
 Sometimes the Home Minister had said- wait, it is interesting that this answer to the Minister of State for Home Affairs has come after the Home Minister Rajnath Singh's statement in December 2014, in which he said that the government demanded Pakistan to hand over the most wanted Dawood to India
 is
 'ajtak' ne sunai thi aawazsambar 2014 main 'ajtak' ne daaud ke karachi main hone ke bare main ectep sunayatha
 When asked questions about this, Rajnath Singh said, 'dawood is among the most wanted criminals
 ham pakistan se pehle hi maang kar chuke hai ki vah daaud ko hamaare hawaale kar de
 
 thodi pratiksha kiijie
 Not only this, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiran Rijiju has also demanded Pakistan to hand Dawood to India
 unhone media se baatcheet main kaha tha ki daaud ke taaja tepe se is baat ke pukhta pramaan milte hai ki mumbai bam dhamaakon kaa mastermind daaud pakistan ke karachi main hi rah rahaa he
 Significantly, in the tape of 'aaj Tak' narrated by Dawood, he is also telling his whereabouts

manmohan singh kii katu aalochana karte hue guuruuvaar ko kaha ki eemaandaaree keval dhan kii nahin hoti, balki yah bauddhik or peshevraana str par bhi hoti he
 The former CAG claimed that Congress leaders had pressurized the cag's audit reports to exclude the name of the then Prime Minister Singh
 raay ne manmohan singh ke netritv main gathbandhan kii raajnneeti kii bhi aalochana kii or kaha ki singh kii zyada rachi keval satta main bane rahane main thi
 It is noteworthy that during the tenure of Rai, the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government came under considerable pressure on the projections of losses in 2-G spectrum and coal block allocation
 raay ne ek patrika se kaha, 'eemaandaaree keval vittiya maamalon main nahin dekhi jaati, yah bauddhik bhi hoti he or peshevraana eemaandaaree bhi hoti he
 You have taken an oath of allegiance to the Constitution, this is important
 ' Rai was asked what his perception of the former prime minister's thinking was, as many people regard him as an elderly politician
 jawaab main raay ne kaha, 'aap raashtra ko sarkaar ke adheen or sarkaar ko raajnneetik dalon ke gathbandhan ke adheen nahin rakh sakate
 At that time it was being said that good politics is also good for the economy, but does good politics mean staying in power? raay desh ke niyantrak evam mahalekhapareekshak ke taur par apane kaarykaal par ek pustak likh rahe hai
 He said that the then UPA government tapped his phone and he believed that Manmohan Singh was also involved in the decision to allocate 2-G telecom spectrum on first come first serve basis and to allocate coal mines without auction
 raay ne kaha, '
 
 2-ji or koyala maamle main singh apni jimmedaari se batch nahin sakate
 In the 2-G case, the then Telecom Minister a Raja wrote all the letters to him and he replied to those letters
 maine unhen jo patr likhe mujhe kisi kaa jawaab nahin mila
 ' raay ne kaha, 'ek maukey par jab main unase mila, pradhanmantri ne kaha mujhe ummid he ki aap mujhase kisi tarah ke jawaab kii ummid nahin karenge, jabaki vah raja ko din main do-do baar jawaab de rahe the
 Then how can they not be held responsible for that decision? ' raay ne 16 november 2010 kii baatcheet ko yaad karte hue kaha ki singh ne unase kaha ki 1
 The loss figure of 2-G spectrum allocation of Rs 76 lakh crore is not the correct method of calculation
 unhone tatkaaleen pradhanmantri se kaha, 'shriman ye vahi tareeke hai jo aapane hamen sikhaye hai, yah baatcheet us din vigyaan bhawan ke manch par baithe hue hui
 ' reliance industries ke keji basin gas kshetra kii audit par raay ne kaha, 'ek baatcheet main reliance ke bare main pradhanmantri kii tippanee un par sidhaa akshep nahin he
 
 reliance ke maamle main mantri str par koi faisla nahin kiya gaya
 ' unhone kaha ki us samay tatkaaleen vittamantri pranab mukherjee ke ek yaa do bayanon ke alaava unhen raajnneetik yaa sarkari str par koi samarthan nahin mila
 Asked if his phone was being tapped, Rai said, "100 percent
" vastav main yah tap kiya ja rahaa tha
 In an interview to another TV channel, Rai claimed that several Congress mps including Sandeep Dixit, Sanjay Nirupam and Ashwani Kumar tried to pressure him to not bring the name of the Prime Minister in the CAG reports on 2G and coal mine allocation
 Of
 raay ne kaha, 'yah nirthak prayaas tha

 team india main shaamil hue akshar patel kii gendbaaji se purv captain sunil gavaskar bilkul bhi khush nahin hai
 He used strong words to say that this left-arm spinner is not a Test cricket spinner and he is just an ordinary bowler
 unhone kaha ki akshar kii gendbaaji kaa aasaani se anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Gavaskar said the 21-year-old spinner was not in a position to become the next big name in Indian cricket and could not be considered an expert spinner in Test cricket as he could not turn the ball over
 'akshar kii gendon main flite nahin hoti'gavaskar se jab poocha gaya ki kyapatel main test spinnerbanane kii sambhaavna he, unhone kaha, 'nahin, akshar patel vah vaikalpik spinner nahin he jis par bharat ko gaur karnaa chahie
 He is an ordinary bowler who does just the ball
 uski gendon main flite nahin hoti he or uski gendon kaa aasaani se anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 He is not able to turn the ball until the pitch is favorable
 vah madhyam gati ke gendbaaj se thodi dhimi gati se gend karata he
 "ashwin, Bhajji, Amit and Karna good options", he said while analyzing Team India for the tour of Sri Lanka, "yes, India can look at spinners like Ashwin, Harbhajan, Amit Mishra and Karn Sharma but definitely the characters
 Not on Patel
 ' patel ne pichley saal antarrashtriya cricket main padaarpan ke baad ab tak 18 vanade or do tii-20 international match khele hai, unhone 18 vanade main 26
 Has taken 23 wickets at an average of 60
 pichley maheene bangladesh ke khilaaf do vanade maichon main unhone do wicket liye
 In the recently concluded five ODI series against Zimbabwe, Patel took five wickets in three matches
 'ranjai trophy kii pichen bhi hai doshi'gavaskar ne kaha ki pichley kuch varshon main bharat agar achche gendbaaj paidaa nahin kar paaya to iskaa kaaran ranjai trophy ke liye taiyaar kii ja rahi pichon ko bhi kuch had tak dosha diya ja saktaa he
 He said, 'we have not been able to produce good spinners for the last few years
 iskaa ek kaaran ranjai trophy maichon ke liye taiyaar kii ja rahi pichen bhi hai
 We leave too much grass on the pitches for Ranji matches and this does not help the spinners
 'gavaskar ne kaha, 'hamen aisi pichen taiyaar kerani chahie jo ballebaajon or gendbaajon donon ke anukool hon
 Grass can be laid but not too much
 pichen aisi honi chahie ki jisase match ke shuru main spinner apni flite kaa upyog karen or iske baad duusare or tisare din ve flite main kami laaen
 "virat's decision to play for india-a is good", he justified Test captain Virat Kohli's decision to play in india-a match in Chennai ahead of Sri Lanka series
 gavaskar ne kaha, 'viraat kii taraf se yah bahut acha faisla he
 He has not played much cricket in the last two-three weeks
 bangladesh main bhi unki form main unke str ke mutabik nahin rahi
 If he makes a big score in the india-a match, then he will go to Sri Lanka with confidence
 'amit kaa team main chunaa janaa chintajanakah agarkaravahin purv tej gendbaaj ajit agarkar ne srilanka ke khilaaf team main amit mishra ke chayan par aashcharya jataayaa or kaha ki yah desh main yuva spin gendbaajon kii kami ko darshata he
 32-year-old legbreak bowler Mishra has been included in the Indian team in place of Karn Sharma
 agarkar ne kaha, 'ji haa, amit mishra ko team main shaamil kiye jane se main chakit hum
 Like Harbhajan Singh, he is picking former spin bowlers
 iskaa ek chintajanak pahalu yah bhi he ki vartmaan main hamaare paas koi yuva spin gendbaaj nahin he
 "agarkar said," Mishra has been out of the national team for a long time and is active in domestic cricket
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki unki gend hawa main or pich par dhimi raftaar se padati he
 Karna is injured, due to which he had to choose the experienced bowler

 Regarding the tours of England and Australia, Pujara said that by playing in these two countries, he learned to accept the failure
 england main khelkar bahut kuch sikhounhone kaha, 'aapako apni vifaltaa ko sweekaar karne kii jarurat he
 Due to the number of runs i was scoring before the tour of England, i always thought that i can score a century in any match, so it was a frustrating experience for me not to score runs
 samay ke saath maine ise sweekaar karnaa siikhaa
 Pujara credited the experience of playing in England with bringing a new dimension to his game
 unhone kaha, 'maine england main khilne kaa kaaphi lutf uthaaya

 haalanki 'da hegg' sthit antarashtriya nyaayalay ne jadhav kii sajaa ke khilaaf bharat kii apil par sunwaayee karte hue may main sajaa kii taamil par roak laga di thi
 With this, a statement issued on 22 June by the Inter Services Public Relations (ICPR) of the Pakistani Army said that the 46-year-old Jadhav had made a petition to General Bajwa last month
 bayaan main kaha gaya ki sainya apiliy adaalat dwaara apni apil khaarij karne ke badabhartiya nausena ke purv adhikarine yah yachika daayar kii
 Pakistan Army spokesman Major General Asif Ghaffoor told reporters Sunday that General Bajwa is analyzing the evidence related to Jadhav
 sena pramukh gun dosha ke aadhaar par jadhav kii apil par faisla karenge
 Under Pakistan law, Jadhav can appeal to the army chief to waive his sentence and if the appeal is dismissed, he can file mercy petition before the Pakistani President
 pravaktaa ne saath hi samvaadadaata sammelan main bharat par niyantran rekha par sangharshaviram kaa ulanghan karne or aam nagarikon ko nishaanaa banane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya or kaha, 2017 main ab tak niyantran rekha par 580 baar sangharsh viraam kaa ulanghan kiya gaya
 He also said that India is being forced to do so due to domestic pressure
 upi vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh yadav kaa 'vikaas sutara' fail ho gaya he
 PM Modi has overshadowed him in terms of development
 lekin upi main samaajawaadee party kii haar kya piem modi or bijepi kii ranneeti kii jeet he
 Or is Akhilesh Yadav's overconfidence the reason for his defeat
 mulaayam-shivpal ko kinare kiyakaha jaataa he ki centre kii satta kaa rasta upi se hokar jaataa he
 Even in 2014, when the BJP formed an absolute majority government at the Center, UP gave 71 mps to the party
 aise main modi or amit shah brigade ko chunauti dena utana aasaan nahin tha
 Despite this, Akhilesh Yadav jumped into the battlefield of UP on his own
 akhilesh ne apane pita mulaayam singh yadav or chachaa shivpal yadav ko kinare kar diya
 The party occupied itself
 mulaayam singh ne apni choti bahu aparnaa yadav ke alaava kisi ummidavaar ke liye raily nahin kii
 Shivpal Yadav also remained confined to his seat in Jaswantnagar
 mulaayam-shivpal kii jodi vah jodi he jisane upi kii satta se congress or bijepi ko baahar kar samaajawaadee kaa paracham laharaaya
 But throughout the elections, mulayam-shivpal remained in the house
 Exclusive Election Result TV: anjana om kashyap ke saath livekamgresa gathbandhan bana musibaikhilesh yadav ne parivaar kii ladaai ke baad samaajawaadee party par apana kabja kar liya
 Akhilesh collaborated with Rahul Gandhi with the intention of ensuring his victory
 gathbandhan ke tahat congress ko 105 siten di gayi
 In such a situation, anger erupted among the Samajwadi Party candidates and workers
 nateeja ye rahaa ki samaajawaadee party main bhitarghaat kii khabaren ain
 Not only is the support of a sinking ship when the Congress is considered to be a sinking ship in the politics of the country
 aise main sapa kaa uske saath gathbandhan bada hairaan karne vaala tha
 For 27 years, the Congress has no land left in UP
 shivpal yadav ne saream congress ke saath gathbandhan par sawaal uthaate hue kaha tha ki jis party kii 4 siten jeetne kii haisiyat nahin , use 105 siten dena nuksaandaayak hoga
 Assembly Election Results 2017: Extensive impact of election results, the reverse effect of the war on Live PM Akhilesh Yadav in his election rallies, on issues like demonetisation, return of black money to PM Modi
 saath hi gujarat ke gadhon ke prachaar par bhi akhilesh ne modi ko gheraa
 However, Modi took the donkey statement in his court and said that he is engaged in country service like a donkey
 vikaas ke naam par tha haiveupi main saat charnon main chunaav puure hue
 Akhilesh held around 250 rallies in the election that lasted almost a month
 akhilesh ne apni har raily main vikaas ke naam par vot maanga
 But in the name of development, Akhilesh did not have any special issue other than Express Way
 jabaki bijli or bigadi kanoon vyavastha sidhe taur par akhilesh ke khilaaf bada mudda bana
 Bata Muslim Votbaspa supremo Mayawati explicitly appealed to Muslim voters of UP to become elephants
 mayawati ne musalamaanon ke bich ye sandesh diya ki upi main bijepi ko rokna he to musalamaanon ko basapa ko vot dena chahie
 Due to this strategy, Mayawati gave ticket to 97 Muslim candidates
 haalanki mayawati kii soshal ejineering unke apane kaam bhi nahin ai
 But this bet has definitely given Akhilesh the edge
 akhilesh par nahin tha mulaayam-shivpal ko bharosa2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main samaajawaadee party ko karaari shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The party was reduced to just five seats
 nateezon ke baad mulaayam singh kaa bharosa akhilesh se uth gaya
 In fact, Mulayam Singh said many times in public forums that tickets were distributed in the Lok Sabha elections at the behest of Akhilesh and the party had to face defeat
 yahi vajah thi chunaav se pehle parivaar ke bich lambii khinchataan chali
 Actually Mulayam Singh and Shivpal did not want Akhilesh to get the right to distribute tickets
 tikat baantne ke adhikaar se jo jhagada shuru hua wo aakhirkaar akhilesh ko party kaa rashtriya adhyaksh banaakar khatm hua
 After Amit Shah became a minister in the Modi government, the question is now echoing in the political circles that who will be replaced as the national president of the party
 sutron ke mutabik aane vaale ek hafte main party kii ore se kaaryakari adhyaksh ke taur par kisi ke naam kaa elaan kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the Constitution of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the election or appointment of the new full-time president of the party can be done only after the organization's elections in more than fifty percent of the states
 bataa den ki bijepi ne sitambar 2018 main party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main prastaav paarit kiya tha ki sanghathan or nae adhyaksh ke chunaav or niyukti kii prakriya loksabhaa chunaav sampann hone ke baad hi karai ja sakati he
 In the wake of Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana assembly elections to be held at the end of 2019, till the elections of the organization in more than fifty percent of the states across the country, the name of the Executive President can be announced by the party
 
 sutron ke mutabik kaaryakari adhyaksh hi party kaa nayaa adhyaksh bhi banegaa
 This means that the appointment of the executive president will send a message in the party organization that who will take over the reins of the party president after Shah? It is believed that for the working president of the party, JP Nadda, Bhupendra Yadav and Kailash Vijayvargiya One's name can be stamped
 sutron kii maane to nadda kaa naam daud main sabase aage he
 While in charge of Nadda, the BJP won a major victory in UP
 mantrimandal main nadda kaa naam shaamil na hone ke baad se hi unke party adhyaksh banane ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Nadda is currently secretary of the party's most powerful parliamentary board and central election committee
 nadda 2010 se navambar 2014 tak nitin gadakari, rajnath singh or amit shah ke saath party ke mahasachiv ke rup main kaam kar chuke hai
 Nadda has also been the president of the BJP Yuva Morcha in 1991 as party president of senior party leader Murali Manhor Joshi
 duusari taraf bijepi mahasachiv bhoopendra yadav ko amit shah kaa kareebi mana jaataa he
 His performance as the incharge of Bihar and Gujarat in this election was impressive
 vahiin, kailash vijayawargeey ne apni sanghathan kshamta ke dam par pashchim bengal main didi (mamata banerjee) ke garh main bijepi ko jo badi kamyaabi dilaai he, saath hi 2021 main pashchim bengal main vidhansabha chunaav ko dekhte hue unke naam ko bhi nazarandaaz nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Be it JP Nadda or Bhupendra Yadav or Kailash Vijayvargiya, all three have proved themselves with organizational ability
 lekin antim faisla pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah ko hi lenaa he
 The 'yes' or 'no' of the RSS will also be of great importance in this
 desh ke paanch rajyon main hone ja rahe vidhansabha chunaavon main paise kaa khel chunaav ayog kii sakhti ke baad bhi roke nahin ruk rahaa he
 After having caught crores of rupees in different cities of Uttar Pradesh, now people engaged in this work have found a new way
 elahabaad dakshini seat ke kai ilaakon main logon ke gharon main ek hajaar se lekar paanch hajaar rupee tak ke maniorder aa rahe hai
 In most money orders, the name of the sender is not written and in which the name is written, people are refusing to recognize them
 yahaan ke kai netaa iske peeche basapa vidhayak or mantri nandgopal gupta kaa haath bataa rahe hai
 The matter has been reported to the Election Commission, along with the postal department has also started investigating the matter
 zyaadaatar maniorder main bhejne vaale kaa naam nahin likhaa hua he or jinamein naam likhaa bhi he, log unhen pahchaanane se inkaar kar rahe hai
 Many leaders here are telling the hand of BSP MLA and Minister Nandagopal Gupta behind it
 is maamle kii chunaav ayog se shikaayat kar di gai he, saath hi dak vibhaag ne bhi maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 After applying the juice, you will have to wait for ten to fifteen minutes for it to dry

 kendriya mantri ramdaas athavle ne ek baar phir aarakshan ko lekar bayaan diya he
 This time Athawale has raised the demand for reservation in the army
 ramdaas athavle ne maang kii he ki sena main anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke logon ko aarakshan diya jaae
 For this, Athawale has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 kendriya mantri athavle ne bataaya ki samvidhan nirmaataa dow biaar ambedkar kehete the ki ham sabhi ko desh kii seva kerani chahie
 In addition, he appealed to all the youth to join the Indian Army and serve the country

 com / lfjqsecwwe — ANI Digital (@ani_digital) August 20, 2017 Demand for reservation in cricket Before Ramdas Athawale demanded 25 percent reservation for scheduled castes and tribes in cricket
 athavle ne baqayada dilli main ek press conference ke dauraan ye maang rakhi tha
 In fact, disappointed with the crushing defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the final of the Champions Trophy, Athawale had said that the reservation to the SC / ST will build a strong team
 unhone kaha tha ki bhartiya team acha nahin khel rahi he, isiilie maine rigerveshan kii maang kii he
 He had said that after Vinod Kambli, no player from our society came into the team
 bataa den ki ramdaas athavle republican party of india ke sansthaapak hai or endie sarkaar main mantri hai
 Please tell that Ramdas Athawale is the founder of the Republican Party of India and is a minister in the NDA government
 bijepi or modi ke dabadabe se muqabla karne ke liye aajkal mahagathbandhan kaa jumala siyaasi galiyaaron main khub charchaa main he
 Opponents such as Maya and Akhilesh have also started making clues to quit
 lekin, gathbandhan kaa netaa koun hoga
 How will TMC and Left in Bengal, DMK and AIADMK come together in Tamil Nadu
 ye wo sawaal hai, jinke jawaab us congress ko talashne honge, jo vipaksh kii sabase badi party he or vahi is mahagathbandhan kii dhuree bananaa chaahati he
 According to sources, Rahul Gandhi has also started informal discussions with his near ones within the Congress on this issue
 haalanki, congress kii praathamikta pehle khud ko majboot karne kii he, jisase gathjod kii surat main wo apni jameen kshetreey dalon ke saamne ganvaane ko majaboor naa ho
 That is why the Congress does not want to hurry, it wants that, as the voices of Maya and Akhilesh are soft on their own weakening, the other regional parties should also be forced to join the grand alliance
 sutron kii maane to mahagathjod kii surat main congress ke saamne teen plan hai
 In the case of Plan a being the biggest party, the PM candidate should be his
 wo ummidavaar khud rahul gandhi hon yaa phir rahul hi kisi ko us vakt manonith karen
 Actually, a camp in the party believes that many regional satraps may not be prepared in the name of Rahul and secondly, if a government is formed somewhere, would Rahul himself want to become the PM of such a mixed government? ? Plan b-congress fought elections in the grand alliance, but in the event of forming a government after the elections, they should support from outside
 aise main nitish jaise kisi netaa ko piem kii kursi de di jaae, jisase khichdi sarkaar ke pradarshan kaa asar us par naa pade
 Plan c-rahul should become the President of the Grand Alliance along with the Congress President
 agar rahul ke naam par kshetreey dalon main sahmati naa ban sake to sonia ko mahagathbandhan kaa mukhiya bana diya jaae or nitish jaise chehre ko modi ke saamne bataur piem ummidavaar pesh kiya jaae
 However, leaders close to Rahul say that these are early political discussions
 abhi 2019 dur he
 Yes, before that there will be efforts of the grand alliance, but big questions like the leader will be decided in the end
 darasal, bhale hi upi main maaya or akhilesh ke bich barf pighalane ke sanket dikh rahe hon
 However, bringing Left and Mamta together in the Grand Alliance is a far-fetched Congress for Bengal
 kuch aisa hi haal tamilnadu main dramuk or annadramuk kaa he
 At the same time, in Odisha, the Congress, which has been playing the role of the main opposition in front of Naveen Patnaik's BJD for years, is now in trouble due to the increasing influence of the BJP in the state
 vaise sutara ye bhi maanate hai ki, sibiai ke saath hi tamaam sarkari agenciyaan bhi hai, jinka ection mahagathbandhan ke banane or bigadane main ahm bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 In such a situation, the discussion of Mahagathbandhan is fast, in terms of success, the example of Bihar is also being given, so the absence of BSP in Mahagathbandhan in UP is being cited as the reason for bjp's victory
 lekin, jab tak ye mahagathbandhan dharaatal par naa utar jaae tab tak kayaas or charchaa jari rahane vaali he
 Because, the political path of the Grand Alliance is quite bitter and stony
