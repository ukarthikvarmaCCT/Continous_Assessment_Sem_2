 Vicky had expressed a desire to contact two bookies
 sattebaajon ne nagar or vicky ke saath chandila se jaipur main mulaakaat kii thi
 The meeting took place in Ranchi in the second week of May, ahead of a match between KKR and RCB
 police ne kaha ki sattebaajon ne usase poocha ki match koun jitegaa or chandila ne unhen bataaya ki keker jitegaa or antat: aisa hi hua
 This raised suspicion that the match may have been fixed but the Delhi Police say that they have no evidence to prove it

 Sagar's family members said that when the officers removed the AC, sofa and carpet as soon as the CM left, they were shocked
 mukhyamantri ko devaria main shahid prem sagar ke parivaar waalon se milanaa tha
 Just before his visit, the Deoria administration had installed new curtains, acs, sofas and carpets in the martyr's guest room
 mukhyamantri ke aagaman ke ek din pehle gaanv kii gandi sadakon ko saaf kiya gaya
 Often open manholes were closed
 head consteble sagar ek may ko jammu kashmir ke poonch main niyantran rekha par gasht kar rahe the, jab pakistani sena ne niyantran rekha paar kar bhartiya gashti dal par ghaat lagaakar hamalaa kiya
 During this time, apart from Sagar, Army soldier Paramjit Singh was brutally murdered
 unke shav kshat vikshat kar die gaye
 His family members, hurt by Sagar's death, had said that they would not perform the last rites until the Chief Minister arrived
 mukhyamantri se baat hone ke baad haalanki unhone shahid kaa antim sanskaar kar diya
 After this, CM Yogi met the family of the martyr on May 12 in Tikampar village
 unhone unhen santvanaa di or chaar lakh rupee kaa check saunpa
 He wrote the education of Sagar's children and assured them of a job

 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne saafe kiya he ki bijepi yaa endie ne raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaari ko lekar abhi koi naam tay nahin kiya he, naa hi ummidavaar ko lekar abhi koi charchaa hui he
 When reporters in Raipur questioned Shah over speculation about the former BJP president and former deputy prime minister LK Advani being made president, he bluntly said that no name has been finalized nor there was any discussion
 maamle menshah se sidhaswaal kiya tha ki laalkrishna adwani raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar honge yaa nahin
 The churning continues in the Congress over the presidential candidacy
 congress ne is pad ke liye naa to abhi apana card kholaa he or naa hi abhi kisi pratyaashee ko tay kiya he
 However, the party high command has started a consultation in this direction
 yah bhi bataaya ja rahaa he ki ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar or sonia gandhi ke bich raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaari ko lekar charchaa bhi hui he
 Recently, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav, who arrived on a three-day stay in Raipur, had said that this time a strong name will emerge from the opposition for the presidency

 donon hi samudaay ke dharmik netaaon se amit shah kii band kamare main baithak charchaa kaa vishay bani hui he
 a senior leader of the Scheduled Tribes category of the state, on the condition of anonymity, said that this time the demand from Amit Shah has been made by the NDA to make a prominent leader of the tribal community a presidential candidate
 unke mutabiq varisht bijepi netaa evam purv saansad nand kumaar saay raashtrapati pad ke liye upyukt pratyaashee ho sakate hai
 He is also a former BJP state president and from a Sangh background
 saath hi rashtriya anusuchit janajati ayog ke rashtriya adhyaksh bhi he
 Ever since the formation of Chhattisgarh, the demand for a tribal chief minister in the state had picked up
 adivasee samudaay ko santusht karne ke liye congress ne rajya kii kaman ajit jogi ko saupi thi
 At that time Nand Kumar Sai was the state president of BJP
 saal 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad vah mukhyamantri pad ke prabal daavedaar bane, lekin raman singh ne baaji maar lee or mukhyamantri ban gaye
 Since then, the demand for a tribal chief minister began to rise in the BJP forum
 rashtriya paridrishy main bijepi shasit rajyon par najar daudaayen, to tamaam rajyon main har varg kaa mukhyamantri he, lekin anusuchit janajati varg se party main abhi kisi ko bhi rajya kii kaman nahin saupi he
 Therefore, the tribal community is running the campaign of the tribal president for the Chief Minister, but not right
 baharhaal rajya ke adivasee netaaon ne apni maang se bijepi adhyaksh ko avgat kara diya he
 It is being told that soon the name of the presidential candidate will be revealed by the BJP

 Indian archery coach Limba Ram left the national team quietly on Saturday and it was not because the team's performance was poor at the London Olympics, but rather that it was being insulted by top archers Deepika Kumari and Jayanta Talukdar

 According to the team source, Deepika and Talukdar had a fight with Limba after which these archers stopped talking to the coach

 The Ministry of Home Affairs has taken cognizance of the violation of constitutional position by the Government of Delhi
 gyaapan main adhikariyon se kaha gaya he ki agar unke dwaara kisi bhi asanvaidhanik aadesh kaa paalan kiya jaataa he, to iske liye vah khud jimmedaar honge
 Not only this, if there is any financial loss due to non-compliance of the illegal order, then it will also be compensated by the authorities concerned
 alji karyaalay ne saaf taur par kaha ki aisi kisi bhi sthiti mechadhikariyon ke khiladenushasanamak karrwai bhi kii ja sakati he
 The Supreme Court has taken over the command of admission in government and private medical colleges across the country
 5 jajon kii bench ne samvidhan ke anuchhed 142 ke tahat supreme court ko die gaye adhikaar kaa istemaal karte hue purv chif justise aar em lodha cameti kaa gathan kar diya gaya
 It is also said that the process of medical admission should be under the supervision of the government
 emsiai philhal isi samiti kii dekharekh main kaam karegi
 The court has also questioned the Medical Council of India fiercely
 kya he supreme court kaa aadesh- supreme court ne medical council of india ke jariye collejon main hone vaali daakhila prakriya kii nigaraanee ke liye ritred chif justise aar em lodha kii adhyakshata main kamity banaai
 Former CAG Vinod Rai and ILBS director Shiv Sarin will be members of the committee
 - court ne kaha ki is faisle se privet kalejon kii swaittata par koi fark nahin padega
 The issue of CET or fees was with the state till now but after notification of NEET it will be under the central law
 - ab ye maamla centre or rajya ke bich hoga jo artical 254 ke tahat aapas main sulajhaayaa jayega
 - Justice Lodha Committee will work till the central government makes any arrangements to improve the functioning of MCI
 - MCI kisi bhi faisle ko khud nahin le paaegi or use justise lodha cameti kii ijaajat kii jarurat hogi
 - The committee is free to issue its own decisions or directions
 - justise lodha cameti MCI act ke tahat saare adhikaron kii nigaraanee karegi or do hafton main iskaa notification jari karne honge
 Strictly on private colleges, the Supreme Court has said in the order that - Private medical colleges have failed to conduct CET transparently and properly
 - jisaki vajah se medhaavi or kamjor varg ke chaatr daakhile se vanchit rah jate hai jabaki lakhon rupee kii capitesan fees lekar daakhile die jate hai
 - The government has better methods of conducting tests and they can be easily detected because the government is under the purview of RTI, Lokayukta etc
 - privet kalejon main daakhilon ke liye sarkaar ke namankit log bhi privet kalejon se jude log hote hai jinka bada vyavsaayik hit hota he
 SC also raised questions on the Medical Council- MCI was formed for the betterment of medical services in the country
 wo apni jimmedaari nibhaane main naakaam rahaa he- wo apni moolbhoot jimmedaari ko bhi nahin nibhaa sake
 Medical professionals who are coming are not fully prepared for them
 yahi vajah he ki ye log primary health centre yaa jila str par upyukt nahin hai
 In fact, the Supreme Court has upheld the law of the Madhya Pradesh government to fill half the seats in the management quota through the state entrance examination
 ye faisla madhyapradesh ke ek privet dental college maamle main somvaar ko sunaaya gaya
 The Supreme Court will next hear the NEET case on May 3

 These included testing the most powerful hydrogen bomb, but now the same bomb-making factory is going to destroy North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un
 uttar korea ke jis newclear site par kim jong un ne 6 main se 5 parmaanu pareekshan kiye the us jagah ko 23 se 25 may ke darmyaan puri tarah se nasht kar diya jayega
 So that no nuclear bomb can ever be built here again and this work will be done in front of the media around the world
 kim jong un ne puraa kiya vaada!12 may ko kim jong un ne bayaan diya ki agar mausam thik rahaa to 23 se 25 may tak desh ke madhya pungye-riparmanu pareekshan sthalko nasht kar diya jayega
 The date arrived when Kim Jong-un promised to end his bomb factory, or nuclear site, in Pyong-ri
 or kim ne apane vaade ke mutabik taiyaari bhi kar lee he
 To record this bomb factory in North Korea on camera
 duniyabar ke patrkaar north korea kii rajdhani pyongyang pahunch gaye he
 All journalists have landed Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, from Beijing via a chartered plane
 ab mausam ke mijaaz par tay hoga ki duniya ke liye khatra bani is bam factory ko 23 may, 24 may yaa 25 may ko tabah kiya jaae
 And if the weather does not support, then this date can also extend further
kim military drill se naaraaz he kidapane mulk se videshi patrakaron ko dur rakhane vaala kim jong un is baar khud chahta he ki duniya ye dekhe ki wo apane vaade kaa kitna pakkaa he
 On the other hand, he also wants to bring the reality of America to the world because on the one hand, Kim Jong expects him to destroy his nuclear site for peace in Korean Peninsula
 vahiin duusari taraf dakshin korea ke saath milakar trump kii sena military drill kar rahi he
 Which makes Kim angry
 lihaaza agar trump ne is drill ko khatm naa kiya or apane dohare ravvaiye main badlaav naa laae to marshall kim trump ke saath hone vaali meeting cancil bhi kar saktaa he
 North Korea expresses anger in this regard, expressing anger on behalf of the North Korea government, that if the US bypasses us and only unilaterally demands that we stop our nuclear program, then we will have such talks Are not in favor of
 saath hi america or uttar korea ke bich hone vaali aagaamee baithak par bhi ham vichaar karenge
 Journalists will go to the nuclear site
 If this happens, North Korea will not only cancel this meeting but can also reverse its decision to end the nuclear site
 shaayad isiilie uttar korea ne videshi patrakaron ko site ke nazadik jane kii ijazat philhal nahin di he
 At the same time, angry Kim from South Korea, who was drilling with the US, first excluded South Korean journalists from this delegation of journalists
 magar baad main ab khabar ai kii kim prashasan ne dakshin korian patrakaron ko bhi pyong-ri kii newclear site tak aane kii ijazat de di he
 Kim always has a plan bearer Kim Jong Un fulfilled his promise, but if US President Donald Trump turns back on his promise, he should remember that Kim always has a Plan B
 pyong-ri kii site ko agar usne duniya bhar kii media ke camaron ke saamne tabah kar bhi diya, to khufia jaankaree ke mutabik uske paas ek or newclear site he jo duniya kii nazar main to band padi he
 But Kim can resume it whenever he wants
 uttar korea ke paas he duusari newclear site!ye uttar korea kii ek or newclear site yongbyon main maani jaati he
 Which was made in 1976
 haalanki antarrashtriya dabaav main uttar korea ko 2008 main is site ko band karnaa padaa
 But in 5 years i
e
 in 2013, Kim Jong Un also threatened to restart the site
 2015 main janvari or sitambar ke maheene main is plant main sandigdh gatividhiyaan dekhi gayi
 The North Korean government is believed to be trying to restart it
 or 2016 main to baqayada ieie yani international atomic energy agency ne is plant main plutonium production paane kii baat kahi thi
 If it does not happen, then the danger of world war will hover
 North Korea can resume this nuclear site completely whenever it wants

 Good news for students who want to take an education loan for further studies
 sarkaar ek aisi skim par kaam kar rahi he jo byaaj daron ko kam rakhane main madad karegi, ajukeshan lone par ek credit guarantee fund skim ko antim swaroop diya ja rahaa he jiskaa phayda na keval bainkon ko hoga balki students ko bhi hoga
 The scheme has been formulated by the Ministry of Finance and the Indian Banks Association and a Credit Guarantee Fund will be created with a corpus of Rs 2,500 crore
 is skim ko cabinet ke saamne jald rakhaa jayega
 7 from this fund to banks
 5 lakh rupee tak kii guarantee milegi
 They will get a guarantee of up to 75 percent in interest if the loan account is declared non-performing
 lekin 7
 Loans above 5 lakh rupees will not be guaranteed as banks ask for security
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke ek adhikari ne angreji akhbaar da times of india ko bataaya ki is skim se bainkon ko bahut madad milegi or ve byaaj daren gata sakenge
 The reason for this would be that the condition for the guaranteeing banks would be that they would not loan at an interest rate higher than two percent of the landing rate, this would cause many banks to deduct interest rates
 darasal, bainkon kii samasya he ki abhi bade paimaane par chaatr-chatraayen lone to le lete hai lekin chukaate nahin hai

 The yoga guru started his fast and said that there have been attempts to plot against him
 haalanki, ramdev ne yah nahin bataaya ki ye sajishein kya hai
 It is said that late Friday night, Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai met him at Ramlila Maidan to convince Ramdev not to go on hunger strike, but the government's attempt also failed

16 million people from across the country have joined his Satyagraha
 unhone daawa kiya ki america or britain ke bade shaharon sahit vishwa bhar main maujuud unke samarthak is anshan main unka saath de rahe hai
 On the importance of fasting and performance, Ramdev said, what will India get from this performance? India will now be saved and people will get a chance to study in their mother tongue in all government professional colleges for the first time
 isse pehle ramdev ko manaane kii koshish ke tahat shuukravaar ko dilli ke ek hotel main kendriya mantri kapil sibbal or subodh kaant sahay ne yoga guru se kareeb 5 ghante baatcheet kii thi
 Ramdev then claimed that the government had agreed to 90 per cent of his demands, but he also announced that he would not withdraw his fast until the entire demands were met
 ramdev ne daawa kiya tha ki sarkaar videshon main jamaa kaale dhan ko rashtriya sampatti ghoshit karne par saidhantik rup se sahamat he, lekin sarkaar ne is sambandh main adhyadesh jari karne ke bare main koi aashwaasan nahin diya he
 In response to the government's response to the issues raised by Ramdev, on Friday night, the Cabinet Secretariat also issued a statement, giving a point-by-point description of what steps the government is taking to deal with the issue of black money
 cabinet sachivalay kaa vaktavy bhi sanket detaa he ki peshewar paathyakramon kii pravesh pariksha angreji sahit bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi karaane, bhrashtachar ke mukademon kii sunwaayee ke liye vishesh fast trek adaalaton kaa gathan karne or lok seva vitaran adhinium ke liye sansad main jald se jald vidheyak pesh karne ko lekar donon pakshon ke bich sahmati ban chuki he

 dilli police ke pulicekarmiyon ke saath hi commando bhi morcha sanbhale hue hai
 In view of security, only one gate has been kept for entering Ramlila ground, where metal detector doors have been installed and people are being searched twice
 subah sadhvi rutambhraa ne bhi ramdev ke anshan ke samarthan main ramlila maidan par jamaa logon ko sambodhit kiya
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad have also announced support for Ramdev's fast
 yoga guru ne anna hajaare paksh ko aashwaasan diya tha ki vah anshan ke dauraan manch par kisi bhi sampradayik takat ko nahin aane denge

 Congress leader and civil servant Manoj Mhatre was brutally murdered in Thane, Maharashtra
 hatyaron ne pehle unhen goli maari or baad main talwaar se kaat daalaa
 This sensational incident of murder was captured in a CCTV camera
 qaatilon ne unhen aisi bhayanak maut di ki dekhne vaale bhi sihar uthe
 In Thane, near Mumbai, Congress leader Manoj Mhatre was killed by some murderers near his house in such a way that even the policemen were shocked after watching the CCTV footage
 kaatilon ne pehle unhen qareeb se goli maari or phir talavaaron se kaat daalaa
 Why the murder took place, at the moment there is still a secret of this
 ghatana thane ke samruddhi apartment kii he
 Where anonymous murderers attacked Congress leader and city servant Manoj Mhatre from around 9 o'clock last night
 us vakt ve apane ghar laut rahe the
 Seeing the manner in which this murder was done, it was clear that the murderers hated Mhatre, they did not want to leave him alive at any cost
 isi vajah se kaatilon ne naa sirf behad qareeb se unhen kai goliyaan maari, balki unke jameen par gir jane ke baad talwaar or dandon se bhi un par waar kiye
 Some more bullets were fired on them in between
 mhatre ko hamalaavaron ne chaaron ore se gher liya tha
 Mhatre also tried to save himself
 mhatre kii cheekh sun kar maukey par pahunche logon ne jab ye manzar dekha to unke bhi rongte khadey ho gaye
 While some started looking for ways to help Mhatre, some escaped on the opposite side
 lekin qaatilon ko dekh koi bhi mhatre ke paas jane kii himmat nahin juta paaya
 In 25 seconds, the murderer kept walking with his life
 disipi manoj patil ne bataaya ki baad main unhen aspataal le jaaya gaya, lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi
 This is not the first time Mhatre has been attacked
 isse pehle bhi un par jaanaleva hamale ho chuke the
 Congress leader Manoj Mhatre was a civil servant
 ve ek baar phir se chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 Mhatre was counted among the domineering people of the area
 is baar bhi wo nagar palika chunaav ladane kii taiyaari kar rahe the
 In such a situation, the police suspect that political rivalry may also be a reason behind this incident
 aaj se centre shasit pradesh bana jammu-kashmiravidhansabha vaala centre shasit pradesh hoga j-klaxxaka bhi aaj se centreshasit pradeshjammu-kashmir or ladakh aaj yani guuruuvaar ko do nae centre shasit pradesh ke rup main astitv main aa gaye hai
 GC Murmu was sworn in as the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and Radha Krishna Mathur as the Lieutenant Governor of Ladakh
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kashmiri avam apni sarkaar ko kab chunegi or kanoon vyavastha ke naam par hiraasat main maujuud raajnneetik bandiyon kii rihaai kab hogi?bataa den ki modi sarkaar ne 5 agast ko jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko nishprabhavi kar diya tha
 After the removal of Section 370, the local police detained people associated with separatist organizations of Kashmir as well as leaders of mainstream parties, political-social activists, as a precaution
 inamen purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti, umr abdulla samet anya netaa shaamil hai
 All these leaders have been under house arrest by the administration for the last three months
 haalanki 2 oktober ko gandhi jayanti ke maukey par jammu or kashmir prashasan ne jammu main najarband sabhi vipakshi dalon ke netaaon par se najarbandi hataa diya tha
 Apart from Chaudhary Lal Singh, president of Dogra Swabhiman Sangathan Party, Devendra Rana of National Conference and SS Salathia, Congress Raman Bhalla and Harshdev Singh of Panthers Party have come out after detention, but the leaders of Kashmir are still under house arrest
 aise main sawaal hai ki in netaaon par prashasan dwaara lagaai najarbandi kab hategi, kyonki bahut zyada dinon tak unhen kaid main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 The government and administration, however, removed the detention with conditionalities by filling bonds with some people in the Valley
 iske baad se mana ja rahaa he ki kashmir main bhi jin netaaon ko najarband kiya gaya he, unhen shart ke saath sarkaar reeha kar sakati he
 
 kashmir ke log kab chune apni sarkarajammu-kashmir ke centreshasit pradesh ke taur par aaj se vajood main aane ke baad ab sabhi ke man main he ki kashmir kii avam apni sarkaar kab chunegi
 Given the situation in the state, there is no possibility of elections for almost six months right now, because not only the political but also the geographical situation of Jammu and Kashmir has changed after the formation of a union territory
 jammu-kashmir main jisi murmu ke uparajyapal bananeke baad rajya purnagathan ke tahat rajya kaa parisemen hoga
 After this, the four assembly seats under Ladakh will be separated
 iske baad jammu-kashmir main jansankhya ke aadhaar par vidhansabha siton kaa nirdhaaran hoga
 This process will take a long time
 iske alaava sabase ahm jammu-kashmir kii sthiti ko bhi dekhnaa he
 In such a situation, it will not be possible to hold elections till the state's condition is normal
 haalanki dhara 370 ke hatane or centreshasit pradesh banane ke baad se koi badi ghatana nahin hui he or na hi koi patharbaji hui he
 If the situation in Jammu and Kashmir remains as normal, then the administration can start preparing for elections after delimitation of assembly seats
 aise main jammu-kashmir ke logon ko apni sarkaar chunane kaa mauka phir se mil sakegaa
 In the Dholpur Assembly by-election in Rajasthan, the Election Commission has denied the allegations that some voters, including the Congress candidate, voted for Kamal if they voted for the Congress

 Now it is being discussed about the CD case through which he was being blackmailed
 ek mahila patrkaar dwaara phone kar unhen blackmel kiya ja rahaa tha
 Actually, in March, the journalist had made a video talking to the Union Minister, based on the same video, he was being blackmailed and was demanding two crore rupees
 mahesh sharma kii shikaayat par police ne kailash aspataal se patrkaar ko giraftaar kar liya
 Master Mind was the owner of a closed channel behind all this
 iske alaava mahesh sharma ko mantri na banaae jane ke baad yah bhi kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa he ki party sanghathan main to nahin bheja ja rahaa he
 In fact, Uttar Pradesh BJP President Mahendranath Pandey has been included in the Modi cabinet
 is tarah se mahendranath pandeya kii jagah kisi anya ko party kii kaman di ja sakati he
 In such a situation, it is believed that Mahesh Sharma will be made the state president in place of Mahendranath Pandey, due to which he was not included in the cabinet
 varisht patrkaar urmilesh ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki mantrimandal main shaamil na kiye jane kii teen vajah ho sakati he
 The first is that those who have not been made ministers will have to work in the organization
 doosraa yah he ki abhi mantrimandal ko chota rakhaa gaya he, aise main baad main jab cabinet se vistaar kiya jayega to unhen shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, the third reason is that he only wants to be kept as an MP, due to which he was not made a minister
 urmilesh kehete hai ki mahesh sharma kii jahaan tak baat he to unhen kyon nahin banaaya gaaya he
 This can only be said by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah
 haalanki unhen mantri nahin banaaya gaya he to sanghathan main kaam liya ja saktaa he, kyonki bijepi kaa upyogi sabit ho sakate hai
 Actually, the name of Mahesh Sharma came in the discussion for the BJP state president earlier also
 iske alaava upi ke vidhansabha chunaav main mahesh sharma siem kii res main bhi shaamil the, lekin baad main yogi adityanath ke naam par muhar lagi thi

 Due to which the name of the college has been changed to its schedule

 After the Supreme Court's decision on firecrackers in the wake of Diwali, while people are happy to remove the ban, on the other hand, environmental officials are also expressing satisfaction in this matter
 lekin supreme court ke faisle main jin kam pradooshan or kam awaz walepatakheyani green pataakhon kaa zikr he wo akhir kya he? ye jaanane ke liye dilli ajtak kii team garuvaar ko dilli ke sabhi bade pataakhaa bazaaron main pahunchi

 dukandaaron ke paas abhi asthaayee license nahindilli main aapako agar abhi pataakhe kareedne hai to keval un dukaanon se milenge jinke paas permanent yani saal bhar kaa pataakhe bechney kaa license he
 In fact, shopkeepers who only crack firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali are given temporary licenses, but licenses have not yet been issued after the Supreme Court order
 dukandaaron main is baat ko lekar kanfujan he ki diwali itane nazadik he lekin dilli police ne abhi tak license kii prakriya shuru nahin kii he
 Unknown people with green firecrackers, reporters from Delhi Aaj Tak went to different markets and asked buyers and firecrackers both what are these firecrackers which have less pollution and less noise
 hairaani kii baat yah ki dukandaaron se lekar kharidaaron tak kisi ko bhi is pataakhon ke bare main nahin pataa
 Narendra Gupta, president of the Sadar Bazar Crackers Vendor Association, said, "it is the first time i have heard that there are also firecrackers that do not cause pollution or noise
" sadar bazaar main pataakhon ke pramukh vikreta harjit singh chhabda ne kaha ki jis tarah se pichley saal supreme court main bain lagaaya tha is saal bhale hi raahat mil gai ho lekin abhi tak hamen license jari nahin kiye gaye

 unhen is bare main nahin pataa ki kis tarah ke pataakhe bechney hai
 If he wanted to get information about this from environmental expert My Breath Delhi founder Raveena Raj Kaul, he also raised his hands
 haalanki export kii maane to in pataakhon main chemical kaa kam se kam istemaal hoga
 Cricketer sellers on crores of stocks say that before the last year was banned, when they had stuffed crores of rupees and after that the Supreme Court had banned it, this stock has not been cleared till last year

 mujhase kaha gaya he ki desh kaa netritv karte hue mujhe kya kuch seekhney ko mila, is bare main apane anubhav aapse saajha karun
 When i came to Delhi after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, i really did not experience many things
 centre sarkaar kaise chalati he, kya-kya vyavastha he
 What is the system — and that proved to be a blessing for me
 agar main puraani pranali kaa hissaa hota, to chunaav ke baad ek khaanche kii tarah jaakar usamen feet ho jaataa
 but that did not happen
 mujhe yaad he ki 2014 se pehle, aapke studio main bhi charchaa hoti thiah ki modi ko kya maaloom he ki duniya main kya chal rahaa he, modi ko isaki samaj hi nahin he? koi anubhav nahin he
 In such a situation, what will happen to our foreign policy? These were questions and were natural
 main nahin maanata ye galat the, kyonki ek rajya main simit rahakar kaam karne vaale vyakti ke bare main sawaal uthne swaabhaavik the
 But in the events of the past, you must have seen what the impact of India's new foreign policy is today
 aaj kaa bharat, nayaa bharat he, badla hua bharat he
 For us, the blood of every brave soldier is precious
 pehle kya hua karata tha? kitne bhi log log maare jaaen, kitne bhi sainik shahid ho jaaen, mujhe nahin lagata ki aap kabhi badi pratirodh kii karrwai kii ummid karte honge
 But now no one can dare to show eye to India
 hamaari sarkaar deshhit ke liye aavashyak har kadam uthaane ko patibaddh he
 Today's new India is following a new policy and practice and the whole world has started to understand India
 aaj kaa nayaa bharat nidar he, nirbhik he or nirnaayak he kyonki aaj desh sava sau karod bharatiyon ke purusharth or unke vishwaas ke saath aage bad rahaa he
 This solidarity of Indians has created fear in the minds of anti-nationals within and outside the country
 aaj jo ye vaataavaran naa he, main yahi kahuunga-ye dar acha he
 When there is a fear of India's might in the enemy, this fear is good
 jab aatank ke aakaaon main sainikon ke shaury kaa dar ho to ye dar acha he
 When the fugitives also fear to seize the law and their property, this fear is good
 jab mamaa ke bolne se bade-bade parivaar baukhala jaaen to ye dar bhi acha he
 When the corrupt leaders also fear to go to jail, this fear is good
 jab bhrashtachariyon main bhi kanoon kaa dar ho to ye dar acha he
 The country endured a lot in the decades following independence
 ab, ye nayaa bharat apni samathrya, apane saadhan or sansadhano par bharosa karte hue aage bad rahaa he
 Is trying to overcome its basic weaknesses and reduce its challenges
 lekin badhate hue is bharat ke saamne ek chunauti or khadi hui he
 This challenge is the opposition of our own country and the tendency of complacency by making fun of our own country
 mujhe aashcharya hota he ki aaj jab puraa desh sena ke saath khadaa he, to kuch log sena par shaq kar rahe hai
 On the one hand, the whole world is supporting India in the fight against terror, while on the other hand some parties are doubting our fight against terrorism
 ye vahi log hai jinke bayanon, jinke lekhon kaa istemaal pakistan kii sansad, pakistan ke channelon, radio par bharat ke khilaaf ek saboot ke rup main kiya ja rahaa he
 While opposing Modi, these people have come down against the country
 desh ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hai
 Today, i want to ask all such people from this forum that you believe or doubt the power of the army? i want to know from them that you have the sayings of our army or do you trust those who are promoting terrorism on our earth? i want to tell all such people and parties that many Modi will come, many Modi will go, but this country will remain ajar-immortal
 bharat rahane vaala he
 And so i urge them, please stop messing with the security of the country, for your political benefit, to confirm your intellectual arrogance
 bharat ko kamjor bananaa band karen
 There is a lot of discussion these days and a voice is coming up
 desh ne aaj rafel kii kami mahasoos kii he
 Hindustan is saying in one voice, if we had Rafael today, perhaps the result would have been different
 or baat ham saaf-saaf samajhen ki rafel par pehle swaarthniti or ab raajnneeti ke kaaran, desh ko bahut nuksaan hua he
 i tell these people very clearly, if you want to oppose Modi then definitely do it, remove the shortcomings in our plans, what effect they are having, what is not happening, criticize it completely
 iskaa swaagat he lekin desh ke suraksha hiton kaa, desh ke hiton ko nuksaan na pahunchaaen
 Keep in mind that in this insistence of Modi opposition, terrorists like Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of terrorism, should not get support, they should not get strength
 jinhone kai varshon tak desh par shashan kiya, unki bas do chizon main ruchi thi- dolls (khayraat) or dils (saude)
 This culture has greatly damaged the development journey of our country
 jin logon ko iskaa sabase zyada nuksaan hua he, ve hamaare sainik or kisaan hai
 Let me talk about the defense sector first
 aisa kyon he ki jinhone itane varshon tak desh par shashan kiya, unke daur main itane saare ghotaale hue? unhone jeep ke saath shuruyaat kii or baad main hathiyaaron, pandubbiyon, helicopteron tak par gaye
 The defense sector suffered heavy losses in the process
 yadi raksha saude nahin hote hai, to raksha intjaamon kaa aadhunikeekaran nahin ho saktaa he
 Whose proximity to all arms dealers, whose friendship is with every intermediary? The whole country knows this and Lutyens Delhi definitely knows this
 ye sabko pataa he, hamaari sena ko niyamit rup se jin chizon kii jarurat he unamem bullate pruf jacket bhi hai
 In 2009, our force requested 1,86,000 bullet proof jackets
 lekin ek jacket bhi nahin mili
 i repeat again, the Army did not receive a single bulletproof jacket from 2009 to 2014
 hamaare kaarykaal main ham 2,30,000 bullate pruf jacket laae
 During our tenure, the corridors of power are free from intermediaries because they know that this government will not tolerate corruption
 ab main dolls kii baat bataata hum
 i loved giving dolls to those in power

 But Aaj Tak is known for asking good questions, i also want to ask some questions from this forum
 mujhe vishwaas he ki ye sawaal aapako sochane ke liye majaboor karenge
 Why have crores of people been forced to defecate in the open till date? Why was the government not sensitive to the disabled till date? Why was Ganges water so polluted till date? Why was the north-east ignored till date? Till date why was there no National War Museum for the brave soldiers of the country's army? Till date, the flag was not hoisted in the memory of Azad Hind Fauj at Nanyo Red Fort? The truth is that at first, there was no attempt to connect the poor with the system
 lekin main yahaan sirf sawaal karne nahin aayaa hum
 i would like to give some answers and that too without asking you

 There was a terrible forest, so they carried guns
 ghaney jangal main paidal chalane kii unki ichha hui or chal die
 Suddenly a lion comes in front of them
 ab kya karen? bandooken to gaadi main hi chhod di thim
 They were thinking, what to do, where to go
 lekin unamem se ek ne apni jeb bandook kaa license nikaalkar sher ko dikhaa diya
 When i told that story, the work of the then government was the same
 tab sarkaar ne act to bahut banaae par acshan nahin tha
 After coming to the government, we also had an action with the Act

 Earlier it was the same government officials, it was the files, it was the offices, but what was the result, everybody knows

 The period from 2014 to 2019 is five years to say, but when you assess the functioning of our government, you will feel that you have returned after many decades of development
 2014 se 2019 tak kaa samay aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne kaa samay tha, lekin 2019 se aage aakankshaon ko puraa karne kaa avasar he
 2014 to 2019 was the time to deliver basic needs to every household but from 2019 onwards there is an opportunity to fly for fast progress
 2014 se 2019 or 2019 se shuru hone vaali aage kii yatra badalte sapanom kii kahani he

 apane filmi kariyar ko lekar kaajol ne ek intervyuu main is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he ki unhone apane 25 saal ke kariyar main kabhi koi shoot cancel nahin kiya
 Why did Ajay not want to meet Kajol again after the first meeting? According to reports, Kajol said in the interview that neither he has canceled a shoot till date nor missed any flight
 aakhri baar dhanush ke saath film VIP 2 main najar ain kaajol kaa maananaa he ki shoot cancel karne se kisi ke lakhon kaa nuksaan hota he jo ki ek badi jimmedaari he
 In an interview to PTI, Kajol said, 'if you fall ill and cancel a shoot, then there is a loss of lakhs from someone's pocket, so it is a big responsibility in your hands
 'is vajah se bigade rani mukherjee ke apni bahan kaajol se rishte?kaajol ne aage is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya ki actors kii sehat ek bada mudda he, lambey shoots, neend kaa puraa naa hona, bed food habits or hameshaa sundar dikhne ke pressure ke chalate khud ko feet rakhana ek or badi chunauti he
 Kajol, 43, recalled once in a career that she said, "I remember i only took leave from producers once when my daughter Nayasa had 104 degree fever
" lekin maine khud tej bukhaar main bhi apni shootings jari rakhi hai
 In this style, Kajol was seen celebrating Durga Puja, Ajay did not come
 Nazarkajol's attitude towards career is like an example for young and upcoming actors
 jahaan kai actors shooting set par nakhre dikhaane se lekar shooting shadul ko cancel karne ke liye khabaron main bane rahete hai unhen kaajol kii is aadat par jarur gaur karne kii jarurat he
 Today, it is not common for Kajol to reach that stage, she still falls in the category of Bollywood's top and successful actress

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's batting ability was being questioned recently after being removed from the captaincy of Pune in the IPL 10 season
 ipel ke lihaaj se baat karen to kaha ja rahaa tha ki pune superjoint team main jane ke baad se maano unke balle main 'jang' hi lag gaya tha
 Harsh had raised the question on Dhoni's strike rate
 The tweet of Harsh Goenka, brother of Pune team owner Sanjeev Goenka, created the atmosphere
 harsh ne apane twit main captain ke rup main dhoni se steve smith ko behatar bataaya tha
 Not only this, he even mocked Dhoni's strike rate
 aalochakon ko diya karaara javabamhendra singh dhoni ne apane khaas style main shanivaar ko tamaam aalochanaon par 'purna viraam' laga diya
 With the help of his batting batting, he gave the Pune team a memorable six-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad today
 match kii aakhri gend par siddharth kaul ko chaukaa jadte hue maahi ne dikhaa diya ki finishr ke role main wo ab bhi hit he
 Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni played an unbeaten 61 in this match which included five fours and three sixes
 dhoni ne yah pari mahaj 34 gend par kheli
 Including Saturday's match today, Dhoni has scored 122 runs in six matches of this IPL, being unbeaten twice and his average is 30 runs
 haari hui baaji ko jeet main badal diya dhoni neis ipel main aaj dhoni ne apana pehla ardhashatak lagaaya
 In the last two overs of the match, Pune needed 30 runs to win and the victory seemed to be falling away from them
 is mushkil maukey main dhoni ne pari ke 19wein over main bhubaneshwar ko do chauke or ek chakka lagaaya
 a total of 19 runs were scored in this over
 match ke aakhri over main pune team ko jeet ke liye 11 ran kii jarurat thi jise dhoni ne manoj tiwari ke saath milakar hasil kar diya
 The matchwinning run, which ended with a four, came in the form of Dhoni's four on the last ball of the match
 main of da match dhoni ne aaj kii pari se sabit kar diya ki phinishir ke role main abhi bhi ve puri tarah khare hai
 In the match, Hyderabad had scored 176 runs losing three wickets
 is score ko pari kii antim gend par pune team ne safaltaapurvak paar kar liya
 The credit for this victory goes to Dhoni's explosive innings
 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan pashchim bengal main hinsa ek bada mudda rahaa he
 Both the Trinamool Congress and BJP have repeatedly accused each other of committing violence in the state
 lekin chunaav ke baad bhi rajya main suraksha balon kii tainaati par trinmul congress ne sawaal khadey kiye hai
 The Trinamool Congress has objected to the bjp's demand for deployment of central forces till the Model Code of Conduct remains in force in West Bengal
 trinmul congress ne mangalvaar ko nirvachan ayog se poocha, ‘‘kya rajya main apatkaal kii ghoshnaa ho gai he
 "let us know that 22 opposition parties met the Election Commission and if the VVPAT slips at any booth do not match correctly, then the VVPAT slips of all the polling booths in that assembly constituency should be counted and matched with the EVM results
 
 lekin chunaav ayog iske liye taiyaar nahin hua
 According to sources, Trinamool Congress national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Derek o'brien raised the issue of deployment of central forces before the Election Commission and demanded that the commission take action on it
 sutron ke mutabik, derek o bryan ne nirvachan ayog se kaha, ‘‘bhaajapa ke mantri ne ghoshnaa kii ki kendriya bal bengal main ek or saptaah rahenge
 Has BJP declared Emergency in Bengal? BJP-RSS members are harassing civilians as a proxy of central forces
 bengal ke liye vishesh niyam kyon? yah sweekaar nahin he
 "significantly, Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in a press conference on May 19 that the BJP was worried that the voters were intimidated and the real voters were not allowed to cast their votes
" unhone kaha, ‘‘in muddon se nipatane ke liye bhaajapa adarsh aachaar samhita lagu rahane tak rajya main kendriya suraksha balon kii tainaati kii maang karti he
 "the code of conduct will continue in the state till May 25
 kashmir kii vaadiyon main beintehaa kubsuurati ke bich badi khaamoshi se basane vaali dastaanen dal jhil ko or bhi gaharaa bana detii hai
 When we heard the stories of the common people of the valley who were full of tourists during the holidays, it was known that they had to pay a great price for being born in heaven
 srinagar ke bulward par barason se khadey darkhton ke bich agar har shaam aapako ek dhimi drive karne kaa mauqaa mili to yaqiin maniye aap in palon ke liye apane saare gam bhula sakate hai
 If you have also done a ride on Shikara, then you will probably know how the lotus floating on Dal Lake is feeling at this time
 lekin agar vaaqai aap srinagar ke logon se baat karte hue unki kahaniyaan sunenge to ye sukun bemaani ho jayega
 The story of Kashmir is nothing short of a highly entangled love story
 aaj bhi harek kii jubaan par yahaan kashmir kii azaadi kaa zikr zarur aa jaataa he, shikaayat rahati he un tamaam siarpief ke javaanon se jo choubison ghante har ghar, har dukaan yahaan tak ki kheton ke bich bhi tainaat hai
 Common people feel suffocated while living in a state which has the status of being one of the most important political issues of the world at all times
 kam hi logon ko ehsaas he ki aaj ke kashmir kii lagbhag 70 fisadi aabaadi yuvaaon kii he
 These youngsters are no different than faces studying or working in Delhi, Mumbai or Bangalore
 haa inke tajurbe shaayad kaafii alag rahe hai
 They grew up in the debate of human rights violations versus jihad
 pakistan or bharat kii dushmani ke bich apni jagah talashte hue
 Each of the two countries also like a little more, the reason is their own
 lekin parampara or samskruti ke saath-saath barason se chali aa rahi raajnneeti ke maddenzar ye bharat se ek bada faaslaa zarur mahasoos karte hai
 You will realize if you talk as a friend along with being a tourist
 is srinagar daure par kuch logon kii kahi hui baaten mere dimaag main bas gayi
 'don't want cheap tomatoes and onions, my brother lives across the border
 ham bees saal se nahin mili hai
 Someone introduce us
 ' 'how will no one become a militant? What will your whole family do when someone is killed in front of your eyes? ' 'puure bharat ko lagata he yahaan sab militant hai
 Yes okay, you are militant - happy now? 'main padhaa likhaa nahin hum, mujhe nahin pataa siyasat kaise hoti he
 But why do those who are educated do wrong things? kashmir ko lekar chaahe kitni hi baaten kahi gai hon, tourist ke liye ye surakshit he
 To be honest, no one here is more lovable than a tourist
 lekin zaraa sa kandhaa aage badhaate hi siskiyon ke liye taiyaar rahiye
 To understand the rest, you can google the history of Kashmir
 kehete hai jab kisi kaa dukh bahut bada ho yaa chot gahari ho to use gale lagane kii zarurat hoti he
 Kashmir also needs to be embraced
 garibi, berojgaare or karaab image se jujh rahe rajya main badlaav ke liye kisi ko to bidaa uthaanaa hi hoga
 Otherwise this ticket of Jannat will prove to be very costly at the time

 kashmir kii kahani ek behad uljhi hui lav story se kam nahin he
 Even today, there is a reference to the freedom of Kashmir on every tongue, there are complaints from all the CRPF personnel who are posted round the clock, every house, every shop and even in the fields
 aam logon kaa dam ghutata he ek aise rajya main rahete hue jise har vaqt duniya ke sabase ahm raajnneetik muddon main se ek hone kaa darja hasil he
 Few people realize that about 70% of the population of today's Kashmir is youth

 aap agar tourist hone ke saath-saath ek dost banakar baat karen to ehsaas hoga
 The words of some people on this Srinagar tour settled in my mind

 hindustan ab "yon apradhi register'' kii shuruyaat karne vaala nauvaan desh ban gaya he
 The United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland and Trinidad and Tobago have already made its debut
 rashtriya aparaadh record beuro (enciarabi) ab ek aisa database rakhata he jisamen yon aparaadhon ke liye doshi tehraae gaye logon ke naam, pate, ungaliyon kii chhap, diene ke namoonay or aadhaar sankhya hoti he
 It is not clear how the NCRB is planning to update the information of criminals and whether this information will be provided only to law enforcement agencies
 is register ko jan suraksha ke upaay ke taur par pesh kiya ja rahaa he or iske rakrakhaav par khaasi laagat bhi aegi
 Apart from this, it will also have a potential impact on former criminals
 is sabko dekhte hue aise register kii sambhavit ahmiyat kii padtaal karnaa munasib hoga
 At first glance, the register that helps criminals and especially convicted criminals of sexual offenses and helps law enforcers in identifying and apprehending repeat offenders seems welcome
 yah database yon aparaadhon ke itihaas kii tasdik karne main police kii madad kar saktaa he, haalanki yah kaam krime and criminal trekking network and system (sisitianes) se kuch had tak pehle hi mumkin rahaa he
 It started in 2009 and connects police station records (arrests, firs, charge sheets, etc
)
 jab is tarah kaa register banaaya jaataa he to yah maanakar hi chalaa jaataa he ki yon mujrim vahi aparaadh shaayad dobaaraa karegaa or isliye khatra he
 However, ncrb's "crime in India" report does not look at habitual criminals and criminals, especially those convicted for sexual offenses
 isliye yah pataa nahin he ki sajayaftaa yon mujrim kitna bada khatra hai
 In order for this registry to be effective, it is necessary to prove the defects in the cases
 isliye bhi ki desh main 90 fisadi se zyada yon aparaadh report hi nahin kiye ja pate
 Sexual offenses that are reported and filed in the criminal justice system are also delayed by delays (NCRB 2016 reported 88 percent of rape cases pending), much lower conviction rates (26 percent) and victimized women often "retracting" in courts They are caught in trouble
 ye aankade bataate hai ki desh main zyaadaatar yon aparaadhon par to najar hi nahin jaati or bahut saare aparaadhiyon ko kisi karrwai kaa saamana nahin karnaa padataa
 The emphasis on registering sex offenders also leads to a "stranger threat", despite data showing that 94% of rape victims are aware of their perpetrators (NCRB 2016)
 yah apradhi aksar padosi, rishtedaar, teacher, partner hote haih or aam taur par andhere main mandaraate anjaan log nahin hote
 With a very low conviction rate, delay in conviction and undocumented risk of repeat offenses, it is unclear how effective the sex offenders' register would be in curbing sexual offenses or investigating new crimes
 nai dilli main 2017 main aayaa sunil rastogi maamla is mushkil ko bakhubi saamne rakhata he
 It was only after this case that the demand for the register of sex offenders caught up
 isamen apradhi bacchee ke saath chhedchhad ke aarope main girakrataar hua tha or usne 12 saal ke dauraan 500 se zyada bacchon par yon hamale karne kii baat kubul kii thi
 Further investigation revealed that charges of sexual assault on him had also been proved earlier (in 2006) and six months in jail had also been awarded
 kendriya mahila or bal kalyaan mantri menka gandhi ne is maukey ko hathohath liya or yon aparaadhiyon kaa register banane kii maang kar daali
 The argument was that this would have prevented some attacks
 magar yah ashavad puri tarah niraadhaar he kyonki register aparaadhon ko nahin roktaa
 Instead, it is time to consider why hundreds of cases are not filed and why they remain unresolved even when filed
 bal yon apradhi sunil rastogi kaa maamla yon aparaadhiyon kaa register banane ko jaij nahin tehraata, iske bajaae yah jamini str par hamaari bacchon kii suraksha vyavastha kii kamiyon or khaamiyon, dayaneey jaanch mashinari or in aparaadhon kaa samuchit jawaab dene main hamaari dand nyaay pranali ke naakaaraapan ko udhedakar rakh detaa he
 Open and closed registers The evidence of countries who have tried such registers is also not really favorable
 misaal ke liye, yon apradhi register kaa istemaal karne kaa america kaa record sabase lanbaa he
 But unlike in India, where this register will not be publicly accessible, in the US the register is open to a public notification system
 neujersey rajya main yon aparaadhiyon ke register kii shuruyaat ke prabhaavon kaa akalan karne vaala ek adhyayan is nattejey par pahunchaa ki isaki vajah se yon aparaadhon ke liye dobaaraa giraftaar kii taadaad main koi kami nahin ai yaa na hi peediton kii taadaad ghati
 On the other hand, the cost of maintaining such a register was substantial and was increasing
 america main is register main darj hone kii vajah se purv aparaadhiyon ko baari paabandiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he or yahaan tak ki unke liye koi acchhee-si naukari talashna bhi bahut dubhar ho jaataa he
 They often face social exclusion and harassment
 darasal is register main apane naam ke saath jeene ke dushprinaam itane bhayaavah hai ki adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki nattejey ke taur par register main saarvajanik rup se naam aane ke baad dobaaraa aparaadh karne kii daren bad gayi
 One study leads to the conclusion that the rate of crime is slightly higher (1
 1 fisadi) kami ai, par uske saath saarvajanik adhisuchana pranali par daal dene ke baad "jab unki soochna khule aam muhaiyaa kar di gai to aparaadhiyon ke aparaadh karne kii sambhaavna or zyada bad gai kyonki uske saath judi manovaigyanik, saamaajik yaa vittiya keemten aparaadh ko or zyada aakarshak bana detii hai
 '' (JJ Prescott and Rock of, 2011)
 iske ulat britain main yon aparaadh register 1997 main band pranali ke taur par shuru kiya gaya
 However, in 2008 the Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme was launched in which parents, caregivers and guardians of children can inquire whether a person has been convicted of a particular child sex offense
 aisi hi sashart khuli pranaliyaan dakshin africa main or australia ke kuch hisson main prachlit hai
 Unfortunately, there are no major studies on the effectiveness of non-public registers in these countries
 diene data or niztaa ke muddein registeron ko lekar ek or chintaa kii baat register main darj logon kii niztaa he, jinhen kam hi hamadardi hasil hoti he
 Given the horrific results of public notification in the United States, there is a real and legitimate apprehension that ex-offenders may become victims of justice or social boycott at the hands of the crowd when the register's data is hacked and leaked
 iske alaava koi behatar rojgaar hasil karne kii unki sambhaavnaaen buree tarah simit ho jaaen or is tarah sambhavit taur par unhen phir aparaadh kii jindagi main dhakel diya jaae
 An interesting aspect of this register in India is the inclusion of DNA data in it
 ummid he ki isse un maamalon ko sulajhane main madad milegi jinamein dobaaraa aparaadh kaa shaq hoga
 The DNA Technology (use and Application) Regulation Bill 2018 under consideration also provides for the establishment of a DNA bank with a different category of crime
 diene data shaamil karnaa america main haal hi main "golden state killer'' kii giraftaar kii raushnee main ahm he
 The criminal is accused of committing 13 murders, 50 rapes, more than a hundred burglaries in the 1970s and 80s and dodging the police for nearly 30 years
 yah jaanch kii shandaar kamyaabi hi thi ki use mauka-e-vaardaat par paae gaye diene ko hajaaron yujar kii genetic jaankaree se las ek nijee anuvanshik website ke saath milakar tasdik karne ke baad pakad liya gaya
 These successes increase the chances of using DNA information in the investigation of crimes
 haalanki bahut gine-chune maamle hai or hindustan main unke mumkin istemaal ko lekar bahut ummiden isliye nahin kerani chahie kyonki hamaare yahaan keval chah kendriya forensik prayogshaalaayein or 31 rajya prayogshaalaayein hai tathaa yon hamalon ke 12,000 se zyada maamle philhal in kendriya prayogshaalaon main nateezon kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 To strengthen the safety of women and children, the government should focus more on increasing systemic accountability for crimes
 behatar police jaanch, majboot abhiyojan or adaalaton main kadai ke saath-saath teji se mukadmaa chalaane kii maang karata he
 We need systems of prevention of sexual offenses and long-term plans to address their root causes
 suraksha chintaaon ko hal karne ke badhate jan dabaav se isaki jad se nipta janaa chahie, bajaae register banane sareekhe bhatakaane vaale upayon ke, jo hifaazat kaa jhootha ehsaas hi de sakate hai

 Describing the one day ban on NDTV India as justified, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that this step has been taken in view of the security of the nation

 Naidu has reacted to the criticism over the decision, saying that 'the proposed action against NDTV India being delayed due to the violation of rules in live coverage during the Pathankot attack, is completely driven by incomplete information and politics

 ' Indian weightlifters won two medals here on the first day of the 21st Commonwealth Games, but the system once again disappointed them
 mirabai chanu(48 kigra) ne rashtramandal khelon main sntch, clin evam jerk or overol record ke saath swarna jeeta, jabakippi gururaja(56 kigra) ne purush varg main rajat apane naam kiya
 The colors of the medals of these two players may vary, but the similarity between the two is that one of the most important days of their lives did not have a physio to take care of their pain and injuries
 recordtod pradarshan ke baad chanu ne pitiai se kaha, ‘mere saath yahaan pratiyogita ke liye koi physio nahin tha
 They were not allowed to come here, i did not get enough treatment before coming to the competition
 yahaan koi nahin tha, hamane adhikariyon se iske bare main kaha, lekin kuch nahin hua
 He smiled and said, 'I asked for my physio, but they were not allowed, but we were helping each other
 ’ karnataka ke gururaja ne kaha, ‘mujhe kai jagah chot lagi he
 My physio is not with me, so i was not able to get the knee and ciatic nerve treated
 ’is maamle main baar-baar sampark kiye jane ke baad bhi pitiai ko bhartiya mishan pramukh vikram sisodiya se koi pratikriya nahin mil pai, lekin bhartiya olympic sangh (ioe) ke adhyaksh rajeev mehta ne kaha ki ioe ne un adhikariyon ke naam kii sweekruti di, jise bhartiya bharottolan sangh (idbluef) ne manjuuri di thi
 He said, 'even after the late request, we have given recognition to the physio as a b class, so that he can meet the athletes but cannot be with them during the competition
 yah idbluef kii jimmedaari thi ki vah jaruri sahyogi staff ke bare main bataae
 'before these games, the number of Indian squads was a big issue, after which the Sports Ministry ordered that the number of officials should not exceed 33 per cent of the number of players

 Monkey loves metro, it is neither a new song nor a jumla
 lekin, bandaron kaa metro prem ek nayaa muhaavara jarur garh rahaa he
 a new case of monkey has been encountered inside the metro
 vakya kashmiri get-faridabad metro line kaa he
 a heavy monkey entered the Metro near Bata Chowk station on the Violet Line
 metro ke is nae musafir ko apane bich paakar safar kar rahe baaki log hairaan rah gaye saath hi dar bhi gaye or wo isliye ki bandar kahin kisi musafir par hamalaa na kar de
 But, even as the monkey had learned the rules of the metro, the monkey crossed one coach and roamed freely in the other coach, but did not harm anyone
 isi bich kisi musafir ne metro ke andar gum rahe bandar kaa video bana liya, jisamen bandar shaan se tafarih karte hue najar aa rahaa he
 On the other hand, officials of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited have denied being aware of any such incident
 dmarsi ke afasaron ke mutabik haal ke dinon main faridabad main metro ke andar bandar hone kii kisi ghatana kii jaankaree nahin he
 However, this is not the first time that the monkey is caught on camera riding the metro
 iske pehle bhi kai baar aisi ghatnaayen hui hai jab bandar na sirf metro ke bheetar ghus aayaa balki khub dhama chaukadi bhi machaai
 Before this, at the Rithala metro station, the monkey had entered the subway and snatched the luggage of the passengers
 dmarsi ke ek adhikari ke mutabik metro ke kai stesan aise hai, jinke aasapaas bandar badi taadaad main paye jate hai
 Often such incidents occur at the beginning or last station of the metro, where the train is empty and standing for a long time
 aise main bandar khaane kii talash main andar tak ghus aate hai or darwaja band ho jane ke baad agle stesan par pahunch jate hai
 In such a situation, Metro staff immediately takes action

 Ramdev said that people do not know the names of FDI, the names of those who are investing in it should be known
 cricket main jis tarah shampagne kii bottle kholi jaati he or ladakiyon ko nachaaya jaataa he, yah nahin hona chahie
 Ramdev targeted the government and said that those who have power in their hands are trying to discredit the CAG
 kaig ke kaaran congress kii vishwasniyata shunya par aa gai he
 That is why Kasab was hanged
 kasaab ko is tarah se faansee di gayi jis tarah shahid bhagat singh ko di gayi thi jisase sarkaar ne aatankiyon ke saamne ghutane tech die
 On the action taken on Patanjali, he said that even before the CBI has been investigated, nothing came out, nothing will come out in the future
 mahendra singh dhoniki tarah videshi sarajameen par lagaataar do test shrinkhalaaon menclinasvipake baad koi captain apana pad bachane kii ummid nahin kar saktaa lekin austrailia or england main 9 maheene ke bheetar do whitewash jhelane ke baavjood dhoni team main or majboot banakar ubhare hai
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, India have lost seven consecutive Tests on foreign soil, out of which the team suffered an innings defeat in four while in one, it suffered defeat by more than 300 runs
 do anya match team ne 196 or 122 ran se ganvaae
 The Indian captain's own batting was also not very effective
 vah england main aath pariyon main 31
 He could score 220 runs at an average of 43, while he scored 20 in six innings of three Tests in Australia
 42 kii behad kharaab ausat se keval 102 ran jode
 In Australia, however, Dhoni captained only three of the four matches, while he was captained by Virender Sehwagne when he was banned due to slow over rate, but India also lost in this match
 dhoni haalanki iske baavjood apni puraani uplabdhiyon ke kaaran apane pad par barkaraar hai
 The team has won two world titles under his leadership and performed many feats for the first time including winning the ODI series in Australia
 iske alaava dhoni ko koi majboot vikalp bhi philhal uplabdh nahin he
 When Mohammad Azharuddin lost the captaincy in 1996 after losing the series in England, Sachin Tendulkar was ready to take charge of the team and no one questioned his role
 videshi sarajameen par saurav ganguli kii dheron uplabdhiyaan us samay bemaani sabit hui jab 2005 main coach greg chapel ke saath unka takaraav hua or austrailia coach ne baaji maar lee
 Kapil Dev, the captain of India's World Champion team, also lost the captaincy after India's defeat in the semi-finals of the 1987 World Cup
 unke purvavarti sunil gavaskar ko 1980 ke dashak kii shuruuaat main pakistan ke khilaaf 3-0 kii karaari shikast ke baad captaini chhodani padi
 At the international level too few captains have been able to save the captaincy despite such a shameful defeat
 riki ponting ko 2011 vishwa cap main team kii haar ke baad vanade captaini chodi padi thi jabaki unki aguai main team ne pichley do vishwa cap jite the
 Ponting was earlier named captain in 2000, replacing Steve Va, who played a key role in leading Australia to the top
 viv richaders ne captain ke rup main koi shrinkhalaa nahin ganvaai or unki aguai main team ne 50 main se 27 test jite lekin iske baavjood unhen sanyas lene ke liye baadhya kiya gaya or richi richardsan ko team kii kaman saunpi gai
 The removal of captains from their posts in Pakistan is not a big deal
 wasim akram or vakaar younis ko 1990 ke dashak main baar-baar ek duusare kii jagah captain banaaya gaya
 The same trend was seen in England too
 maaikel vaan ne 2005 main england ko ashes dilaai or paanch saal tak team kii kaman sanbhali
 During this time, the team won half of their 52 Tests under his leadership
 iske baavjood unhen pehle vanade captaini paal collingwood or phir test captaini kevin petersan ko ganvaani padi
 However, South Africa has preferred to retain a player for a long time
 hansee kronye ne 53 test main team kii kaman sanbhali jabaki greem smith ab tak 83 test main team kii captaini kar chuke hai
 South Africa, however, never had to go through a difficult situation like India during this period
 bijepi in dinon ‘nayaa cheharaa koun’ ke dwandv se guzar rahi he
 This is the reason why there is a ruckus among the leaders of the second line of the party and they are engaged in establishing themselves
 party ek taraf jahaan kattarpanthi vichaardhaara ke himachati gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko aage laane kii jugat main he to duusari ore madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii chhavi ko rashtriya str par chamakaane kii kavayad ho rahi he
 What will be the role of senior leader LK Advani in the next election has not been formally clarified yet, despite this, it remains in the future contenders
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri modi apana kad jaahir karne kaa koi mauka nahin ganvaate or ve khud hi apane tareeke se tathaa apane chaahane waalon ke munh se apana naam uchhalvakar ‘bhavi pradhanmantri’ kii bahes ko janm de dete hai
 It is a matter of fact that soon after the name of Modi, the Janata Dal (united), the major constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has started turning its eyes
 bhavi pradhanmantri ko lekar bhaajapa ke sahyogi dalon ke bich uthe vivaad ke baad madhya pradesh se shivaraj kii rashtriya str par chhavi banane kii koshish shuru ho gai he
 This initiative is done by the Public Relations Department of the state
 vibhaag ne 21 agast se angreji main chaar prishthon kaa aakarshak masik news bulatin ‘da empi bulatin’ kaa prakaashan shuru kiya he
 At this time, publication of this bulletin is also important because Shivraj has been highly appreciated in the recent meeting of BJP Chief Ministers in Delhi
 is bulatin ko kendriya mantralayon, vibhinn rajyon, anya deshon ke duutavas sahit pramukh sthanon par bheja jayega
 One thing is clear from this that preparations have been made to take the success of Shivraj's work and plans to every corner of the country
 ‘da empi bulatin’ kaa taaja ank puri tarah shivaraj kii yojanaon kii safalataa va rajya kii pragati ke daawey ke irdagird hi ghumta najar aata he
 On the front page, where there is news of the United Nations Award for the Public Service Guarantee Act brought by the Shivraj government to provide government facility to the common man within the stipulated time frame, the economic and agricultural growth rate of Madhya Pradesh is higher than the country
 Is mentioned to be
 iske alaava is bulatin main rajya main banaae ja rahe 27 audyogic kshetra, nai saura urja niti, bagwani centre sthapana niti, bundelkhand kshetra ke liye alag se audyogic centre vikaas nigam kaa gathan, vidyut sanyantron ke liye jameen kaa aavanton sahit sarkaar kii anya uplabdhiyon kaa byoraa diya gaya he
 While Modi's image is that of a radical leader, Shivraj is seen as an advocate of communal harmony with a simple, simple politician
 haal hi main mukhyamantri ke pramukh sachiv banaae gaye manoj shrivastav kii pahchaan navachaar ke kshetra main kaam karne vaale afasar kii rahegi
 In the last assembly elections, the Chief Minister Kanyadan Yojana and Ladli Laxmi Yojana played a key role in bringing back the government
 in yojanaon ko amali jama pehanaane main shrivastav kii ahm bhoomika thi, tab vah jansampark ayukta hua karte the
 He has now launched a campaign to create a 'national image' of Shivraj
 varisht patrkaar girizaa shankar kaa abhimath he ki sarkari tantra apni uplabdhiyon ke prachaar-prasar ke liye tarah-tarah ke prayog karata rahata he, unheen main se ek angreji main prakashit hua ‘da empi bulatin’ he
 Every government tries to reach the information of the work done by it
 saath hi sarkaron kii dilli tak apni baat pahunchane kii aantarik ichha hoti he, rajya sarkaar kii koshish bhi isi aantarik ichha kaa hissaa he
 With the release of 'the MP Bulletin' in English, the message of Shivraj's plans behind sending it to the embassy along with other states of the country is believed to be sent far and wide, so that when it comes to Modi, Shivraj is not left behind
 
 punjab sarkaar kii ek bocolate ko lekar sarkaar main sahyogi akali dal or bijepi ke bich main tanatani bad gai he
 In fact, the Public Relations Department of the Punjab Government has published about 25 lakh copies in the Punjabi, Hindi and English booklet titled '9 years Punjab It Vikas De', to record the achievements of the last 9 years of the Punjab Government
 afasaron ke jariye kitaab puure rajya main banti ja rahi he
 The special thing is that it does not even mention the photo of any local or national leader of BJP and a minister in the government
 isse pehle rajyabar main punjab ke vikaas ko dikhaate hordings main apane netaaon kii photo naa hone par bijepi netaa aapatti jataate rahe hai, lekin ab is bocolate se apni or apni party ke bade chehron kii photo laapata hone se sarkaar main bijepi ke cote se mantri khulkar apni aapatti darj karvaa rahe he or apni sahyogi akali dal ko gathbandhan dharm kii yaad dilaa rahe he
 In the Punjab government, cabinet minister Anil Joshi objected to the bjp's quota saying that there should have been a photo of BJP leaders
 kam se kam shaharon main vikaas ko darshaate hordings main piem modi kaa hi photo laga dete
 About 20 lakhs in Punjabi, 4 lakhs in Hindi and 1 lakh booklets in English have been published
 isamen alag-alag vibhaagon kii tarakkee ko darshaate siem prakaash singh badal ke chaar, dipti siem sukhbir singh badal ke paanch photo or akali dal ke anya mantriyon ke photo bhi chape hai, lekin bijepi kaa naa to kahin naam he or naa hi unke mantriyon ke kaam kaa zikr he
 At the same time, on this whole controversy, Punjab Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal says that this is not a booklet of the propaganda of any party, but an account of the work of the Punjab Government and as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the face of the Government of India, the Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal is the face of the Punjab government

 Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) inaugurated the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) worth 80 thousand crores with Vedic chanting
 is dauraan andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri wies jaganmohan reddy or maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis maujuud rahe, lekin kesiar ke bhattije or purv sinchai mantri harish raav gaiyrhaazir rahe
 Since then, there has been speculation of a rift in KCR and his family
 kaleshwaram lift sinchai pariyojna duniya kii sabase badi sinchai pariyojna he
 Under the project, 283 thousand million cubic water of Godavari river can be used for irrigation and drinking
 isse telugana ke 13 jilon ko sinchai or pine kaa pani uplabdh ho sakegaa
 This project was started three years ago in the year 2016
 harish raav ne kaleshwaram lift sinchai pariyojna ke karyanvayan main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 In such a situation, the absence of Harish Rao is being discussed vigorously in the political corridor
 vah jaishankar bhupalpalli jile main yojit lunch main bhi nahin upasthit rahe
 Let us tell you that Harish Rao is the nephew of TRS chief KCR
 unhone telugana rajya kii maang ko lekar chalaae gaye andolan main sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi
 In kcr's nephew Harish Rao political corridors are discussed that KCR wants to bring forward his son Katie Rama Rao and succeed his political legacy and party
 isi ke chalate wo apane bhattije harish raav ko darkinar karnaa chaahate hai
 Earlier, KT Rama Rao has been made the acting president of the party, while Harish Rao was not given any consideration in the assembly elections
 aapako bataa den ki pichley saal disambar main telugana main vidhansabha chunaav hue the, jisamen tiares ko shandaar jeet hasil hui thi
 a TRS leader said on the condition of anonymity that Harish Rao had done one day and night for kcr's Kaleswaram project
 harish raav ne hi jamini par iske karyanvayan ke liye kaam kiya
 Currently, Harish Rao is an MLA from Siddipet
 jab kesiar duniya kii sabase badi sinchai pariyojna kaa udghaatan kar rahe the, tab wo apane jile main yojit antarrashtriya yoga diwas kaarykram main hissaa le rahe the
 However, later he took part in the celebrations organized about the Kaleswaram project in his home region
 aapako bataa den ki yah pariyojna megha ejineering and infrastracchar limited (emiel) or BHEL ke sahyog se 80 hajaar karod rupee kii laagat se taiyaar kii gai he

 But in today's modern times, what are these things believed
 kya koi shaks yoga sadhana se pani par chal saktaa he
 You may also be thinking that this is not possible at all
 lekin yoga ke dam par pani par chalane kaa daawa kiya he china ke rahane vaale buddha bhikshu shi lilyong ne
 He has also made videos in front of hundreds of people to justify this claim

 He has broken his own record of running for 5 meters
 haalanki kuch logon ne yah bhi coment kiya he ki unhone apane daudane ke liye pani takhtiyon kaa istemaal kiya he
 But if you watch the video carefully, you will find that these placards are so light and sink in water as soon as they have legs
 tippaniyan We cannot say from the claim that there is a power of yoga or any technology has been used behind this miracle of Xi Liliong
 lekin itnaa jarur he jo bhi is video ko dekh rahaa he vah hairaan rah jaataa he
 This video is two years old and is being seen extensively in social media
