 The relationship of death and life is not just related to breath
 kai baar jindagi jite ji maut ban jaati he or kai baar maut mar kar bhi jinda ho jaati he
 The most striking example of this strange puzzle is the death of an 18-year-old girl from Delhi and her dream
 is ladki kii maut ne do saal pehle kii nirbhaya kii kahani ko phir se jinda kar diya he
 On December 16, Wobdan was a medical student and on November 27, she was going to become an innocent fashion designer
 majdoor baap ke sapanom main rang bharne ke liye jhuggi main rahane ke baavjood
 But his wishes, these dreams, these hopes, these dreams all remained incomplete
 garibi ke andhere se nikal kar apni jindagi main ek nai subah kaa uskaa intjaar bhi adhuraa rah gaya
 His ability to win the war also remained incomplete, which he had saved for his poor parents
 sab kuch to adhuraa rah gaya
 Just like this design on his hand made pieces of paper remained incomplete
 sapanom or jindagi
 
 sabko ghanton rondadesh kii rajdhani dilli main uske tan, man, sapanom or jindagi sabko ghanton ronda gaya
 Then as soon as he was trampled, his breath was broken
 lekin uske baad bhi use choda nahin
 Rather now trampled his death
 bas us ek raat ke liye hi ye maa-baap ghar se dur gaye the
 Leaving your moon at home
 or bas wo ek raat main hi inaki duniya ujaad gai
 Have you ever seen a star break? Watching the sky turn from where that star is broken
 us toote sitare kii jagah jhat se koi doosraa tara le letaa he
 a star starts to glow in the hole where it was broken
 magar chand ko gaayab hote dekha kabhi? uski jagah amavat hi aati he bas
 Amavas ends one day
 magar inke liye ye amaavas to khatm hone se rahi
 Suddenly, like all other dreams, this story is of a girl from Delhi
 ek garib ladki jo dilli kii jhuggi main rah kar apane majdoor baap ke sapanom main rang bharne ke liye fishan digining kaa course kar rahi thi
 All the dreams of poor parents were related to him
 par 27-28 november kii raat achaanak saresapane chakanachurho jate hai
 Because two goths entered her house that night
 dilli ke narela industrial aria ke ird-gird based is ghani aabaadeewale rihaayshi colony main aam taur par raat der se hoti he
 That night, in the darkness, a man saw two people carrying a third man on his shoulder
 lekin neend ke jhonke main use laga ki shaayad kisi biimaar ko ilaaj ke liye uthaa kar le ja rahe hai
 But by the morning, when the truth of those pictures seen in the shadow of the shadows came to light, the ground slipped under the feet of the entire colony along with the one who saw it
 colony kii ek ladki gaayab thi
 And it was a matter of concern that the girl who was missing from her house, her family members also went out of work somewhere
 kisi anhoni se ghabaraae fouran puri colony ne ladki ko dhundhana shuru kiya
 When the girl was nowhere to be found, by evening, people turned to the nearby forest
 or jangal main jo kuch dikhaa, usne sabko andar tak hilaa diya
 The 18-year-old girl, who was missing from her home, was found dead in the forest
 or wo bhi bagaiyr kapadon ke
 It was clear that he had been murdered and before the murder someone had done too much with him
 sisitivi footage main najar aayaa suraagaye khabar dahalaanevaali thi
 So that night, the girl sleeping alone in her house was abducted by someone
 or saae ke shakl main najar aae wo do log hi kya kandhe par usee ladki ko uthaa kar le ja rahe the? is sawaal ne wo manjar dekhanevaale padosi ko baichaiyn kar diya
 And he told the police everything from Tafsil
 ab tak is maamle main besurag bani police ko is chashmadid kii surat main pehla suraag mil chukaa tha
 Now the police intensified the investigation and in this connection he also investigated the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the street
 footage khangalate hi use doosraa suraag najar aayaa
 Hearing the story, the police also sensed, in fact, the man who saw someone carrying a shoulder on the shoulder in the darkness of the night had told the police that it would be three o'clock
 or ittefaq se sisitivi footage bhi raat ke teen baje police ne ek champion tempon ko vahaan se jate hue dekha
 Now all the police investigation got stuck in this champion car
 poochne par pataa chalaa ki usee ladki ke pados main rahanevaala ek ladkaa bhi champion chalaata he or ittefaq se wo bhi isvaardaatke baad se hi apane ghar se gaayab tha
 In these circumstances, along with the police, the needle of suspicion of all the people also went to the same boy
 jald hi police kii koshish rang laai or us ladke ko pakad liya gaya
 He was a minor who first tried to trick the police
 lekin jab police ne usase kaayade se poochtacha kii, to usne jo kahani sunai use sun kar police bhi hairat main pad gai
 The boy confessed that on the intervening night of 27 and 28, he met with a friend and raped and murdered a girl living in the neighborhood
 lekin is vaardaat ko anjaam dene kaa usne jo tarika bataaya, wo rongte khadey karanevaala tha
 It was also difficult to think that how can a human do this to another person like himself? But sadly, her story was in the face of the murder of a innocent girl
 ek baar phir
 
 
 a minor was also involved in the handicap case of a minor in a horrific incident
 vahi naaballig jise balig naa hone kii vajah se sirf teen saal kii sajaa hui or abhi isi maheene wo baahar bhi aane vaala he
 Something similar happened with Nai Nirbhaya
 darasal ladki ke maa-baap kuch jaruri kaam se us raat baahar gaye the
 And this was known to the minor boy living in the neighborhood
 bas vahiin se uske dimag main shaitan ghus gaya
 After gang rape, murder and murder of an innocent girl, then this story of gang rape with a corpse started from a party
 wo party jo us raat is ladki ke pados main rahanevaale naaballig ladke ne apane dost ko di thi
 The process of drinking and drinking continued till late in the night
 inamen ek to vahi ladkaa tha, jo naaballig hone ke baavjood tempo driver tha or doosraa tha uskaa dost abhimanyu, jo paas hi ke fruit mandi kaa loder kaa kaam karata tha
 Till the party, everything was fine
 lekin party khatm hone ke baad sharaab ke nashe main donon ne jo plan banaaya, usne ek hi jatke main kai khwab kuchal die
 This plan was very scary
 darasal, pados main rahane kii vajah se naaballig ladke ko ye pataa tha ki bagal main rahanevaala parivaar apni jawan beti ko akelaa chhod kar baahar gaya he
 And this is what made that single girl a soft target for these two friends
 pole khulne ke dar se ladki ko maar dalaraat ke andhere main sharaab ke nashe main dhutt pehle to donon chat ke raste se ladki ke ghar main daakhil hue or ghar main akeli so rahi ladki ke saath jyaadati karne kii koshish shuru kar di
 But when the girl protested, the matter reached the beatings along with the excesses
 or phir donon ne aadhi raat ladki ke saath kuch itani jor-jabardastee kii ki wo behosh ho gai
 Now both of them started to think that by the time they get up in the morning, this girl should not destroy their rule in front of the era
 or bas isi ek dar ne donon ladakon ke dimag main wo sajeesh paidaa kar di, jisane is ladki kaa katl karvaa diya
 But what they both did to the girl's body after the murder, no one can even think
 aise logon ko ham jehani biimaar bhi kah sakate hai
 Otherwise, how can one eradicate the hunger of lust even with the corpse? This new Nirbhaya was robbed while alive
 phir uskaa katl kiya
 And when she died, she did not leave her body either
 aise logon ko koi kaise insaan kah saktaa he?raat bhar laash ke saath karte rahe gangreparaj fash hone ke dar se raat ke andhere main donon ladki ko to uske ghar se to uthaa laae, lekin ab donon ke saamne sawaal ye tha ki aakhir wo use lekar jaae to kahaan jaae
 After this, both of them lay the girl in her champion tempo and then take her straight to the nearby forest
 sharaab kaa nasha ab bhi donon ke sir chadh kar bol rahaa tha
 So, both of them strangled him to death before he intended to hide evidence
 lekin iske baad donon ne jo kuch kiya vaisaa koi soch bhi nahin saktaa
 Would you believe that both of them also committed excesses to the girl's body
 or phir subah hone se pehle hi donon faraar ho gaye
 Actually, both of them felt that their secrets along with the girl would be buried forever
 ladki ke gaayab hone se colony main machi halchaludhar, colony main ladki ke gaayab hone kii vajah se bhuuchaal aa chukaa tha
 And by the evening of the next day, his body was also found
 chunki pehle-pahal is maamle main police ke paas kaatilon kaa koi suraag nahin tha to police ne ladki ke mobile phone ke kol detail se maamle kii tafteesh shuru kii
 But it was clear from the analysis of the call detail that that night the girl did not talk to any stranger or any boy
 yani us raat ladki ko use uthaa kar le janevaale bhi uske ghar main jabaran ghuse the
 And then as the investigation progressed, the witness of the man who lifted the girl in the darkness of night came out
 or champion tempo kaa suraag bhi mil gaya
 And thus within a few hours, the girl's minor criminal was caught by the police
 mumkin he, kal ko gunahagaaron ko unki sajaa bhi mil jaae, lekin sharaab or sanak ne jis tarah ek parivaar ke tamaam khwab kuchal die, wo khwab ab kabhi jinda nahin ho sakenge

 dur kii baat chhodie, main khud hi yaar-doston ke bich dekhtaa sunata rahata hum ki falaan depressant kaa shikaar ho chukaa he
 Actually, psychiatry is not the name of any one disease
 iske tahat kai prakaar kii maansik bimaariyaan aati hai
 Nowadays, you have started to learn about many psychiatry through movies too
 deepika padukon or karan johar jaise abhinaytaon ke jariye bhi
 Nevertheless, it is important to understand that psychiatry is not the name of a disease
 yah ek shrenee he
 
 
 There are many diseases under this
 schizophrenia,polar disorder,depressant,dementia,angzity,alazimer,frequent mental distress, insomania, hiper activity disorder,painic atake, cleptominiya,stress, rej yani gussa jisaki giraft main aakar aap kisi kii jaan tak le lete hai
 Diseases vary according to age
 bacchon main iske alag rup hote hai or vridhon main alag
 Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are considered to be serious psychiatric
 anumaan he ki bharat main iske ek se do karod rogi hai
 Five crore people of general psychiatry are victims
 skool kaa chaatr gusse main apane shikshak ko chaaku maar detaa he
 If there is a scratch on the bumper of the car, then the person landing on the car kills the front man
 kota main aae din khabar aati rahati he ki pariksha ke tanaav ke kaaran kisi chaatr ne aatmahatya kar lee
 We are now becoming normal about these news stories
 yahi pramaan he ki manorogiyon kii sankhya badhate-badhate saamaanya lagane lagi he
 In May this year, when India's Health Minister JP Nadda was speaking in the Lok Sabha, he presented the data of the National Commission on Macroeconomics and Health 2005
 kya hamaare desh main niyamit survey bhi hote hai yaa yah sab anumaan ke aadhaar par hi kaha ja rahaa he
 The Government of India has given the task of National Mental Health Survey to NIMHANS of Bengaluru to know exactly how many psychiatrists are there in India
 swasthya mantri jepi nadda ne loksabhaa main bataaya tha ki yah survey ek june 2015 ko shuru hua tha or paanch april 2016 tak 27,000 logon kaa survey hua he
 The number of professionals treating mental illness in India is also very less
 mahanagaron main to aapako madad mil jaati he lekin jilon or kasbon ke str par haalat kharaab he
 In the Lok Sabha, the Health Minister has said that there are 3800 psychiatrists, 898 clinical psychologists
 matlab 10 lakh logon main teen manochikitsak hai
 There are 17 psychiatrists per million in China
 bharat main 66,200 manochikitsakon kii jarurat he
 269,750 psychiatric nurses are needed
 indian express main yah sab chapa tha
 Newspapers are published on psychiatrists in the coming days
 tivi main kam dikhataa he kyonki ham to aapako manorogi banane main lage hai
 Given the kind of visual language being used, you are less likely to remain normal
 kam se kam raktchaap yani beepi to bad hi jaataa hoga
 Nowadays, the big question is being discussed about poverty and unemployment, what should be done with Pakistani artists
 bharat main 443 sarkari mental hospital hai
 There is not a single mental hospital in six states
 unki kya haalat he yah ek alag vishay ho saktaa he
 This August, the Mental Health Care Bill 2013 was passed
 iske mutabik maansik taur par biimaar logon ke amanviya tareeke se ilaaj ko aparaadh mana jayega
 Shock therapy to pediatric patients will be prohibited
 bado par bhi iskaa istemaal tab hi kiya jayega jab district medical board isaki ijaajat de or vah bhi ensthesia dene ke baad hi
 Under this law, people with psychiatry will be able to decide the course of treatment themselves
 tippaniyan According to the new law, if a person tries suicide under heavy mental pressure, then he will not be considered a crime
 
 
 use indian pinal code ke section 309 ke tahat ek saal tak jail main nahin bheja ja sakegaa
 Clearly, for the first time in India's history, suicide attempts have been excluded from the category of crime
 abhi tak aatmahatya ko aparaadh maanane kii british kaaleen kanoonee parampara chali aa rahi thi
 It also means that the Indian government has accepted suicide as a psychiatric disease
 kai log jo aatmahatya kii koshish karte hai unke parivaar ke log police kii karrwai ke dar se unhen doctoron ke paas lekar nahin jate, unka ilaaj nahin karaate
 After removing it from the category of crime, thousands of such people will now be able to go to the experts for the treatment of psychiatry
 darasal bharat main mental health par koi khaas niti thi hi nahin
 The National Mental Health Policy was launched for the first time in October 2014
 mashhoor manochikitsak Helen m Farrell ke anusaar depressant kaa marij madad maangane main das saal laga detaa he
 Until then, he is unable to accept that he is a patient
 farail kaa ted tok main is vishay par ek bhaashan bhi he, aap dekh sakate hai
 He said that complete figures on this subject are also not available in India
 logon ko lagata he ki depressant he, jaise koi mausam he, karthik ke baad aghan aa hi jayega
 The first condition of awareness of mental illness is that we accept
 sweekaar karne kii bhi koi pehali shart hoti hogi ki hamen pataa to chale ki ham biimaar hai
 Otherwise, at the national level, we are not boasting on the words of four people and we do not consider that journalism
 badi sankhya main log apni pahchaan ko gupt rakhte hue manochikitsakon ke sampark main hai
 Leave aside, i keep hearing between friends and friends that i have become a victim of depression
 darasal manorog kisi ek beemaari kaa naam nahin he
 Many types of mental illnesses come under this
 aajkal aap filmon ke jariye bhi kai manorog ke bare main jaanane lage hai
 Also through actors like Deepika Padukone and Karan Johar
 phir bhi samajhnaa jaruri he ki manorog ek beemaari kaa naam nahin he
 This is a category
 
 
 iske tahat kai bimaariyaan hai
 Schizophrenia, polar disorder, depression, dementia, anxiety, Alzheimer's, Frequent Mental Distress, Insomnia, Hyper Activity Disorder, panic attack, kleptomania, stress, rage means that you get caught and kill someone
 umr ke hisaab se bimariyon kaa fark aata rahata he
 It has different forms in children and different in old age
 schizophrenia or bai polar disorder ko gambhir manorog mana jaataa he
 It is estimated that there are one to two crore patients in India
 jo saamaanya manorog hai unke paanch karod log shikaar hai
 The school student angrily stabs his teacher
 car ke banpar par kharonch aa jaati he to car vaala utarkar saamne vaale ko maar detaa he
 On the day Kota comes the news that a student committed suicide due to exam stress
 ham in khabaron ko lekar ab saamaanya hone lage hai
 This is the proof that the number of psychiatrists is becoming increasingly common
 is saal may main jab bharat ke swasthya mantri jepi nadda loksabhaa main bataa rahe the to unhone neshnal kamishan aan macroiconomix and health 2005 kaa aankada pesh kiya
 Are there regular surveys in our country or is it all being said on the basis of estimates only
 bharat sarkaar ne bengalooru ke nimahans ko rashtriya mental health survey kaa jimmaa saunpa he taaki sahi-sahi pataa chal sake ki bharat main kitne manorogi hai
 Health Minister JP Nadda had told in Lok Sabha that the survey started on June 1, 2015 and till April 5, 2016, 27,000 people have been surveyed
 bharat main maansik rog kaa ilaaj karne vaale peshewaron kii sankhya bhi bahut kam he
 You get help in metros, but at the level of districts and towns, the condition is bad
 loksabhaa main swasthya mantri ne bataaya he ki 3800 manochikitsak hai, 898 clinical cycologist hai
 That means there are three psychiatrists in 10 lakh people
 china main 10 lakh par 17 manochikitsak hai
 66,200 psychiatrists are needed in India
 269,750 cycetric nurson kii jarurat he
 It was all printed in the Indian Express
 aae din akhabaaron main manorogon par khabaren chhapati rahati hai
 Less is seen in TV because we are engaged in making you psychopathic
 jis tarah kii vijual bhashaa kaa istemaal ho rahaa he use dekhte hue aapke saamaanya rahane kii sambhaavna kam hi he
 At least the blood pressure, ie BP, would have increased
 aajkal garibi or berogari se bade sawaal par charchaa ho rahi he ki pakistani kalakaaron ke saath kya saluk hona chahie
 There are 443 Government Mental Hospitals in India
 chah rajyon main to ek bhi mental hospital nahin he
 What his condition is may be a different subject
 isi agast main mental health care bill 2013 paas hua he
 Accordingly, inhuman treatment of mentally ill people would be considered a crime
 bal rogiyon ko shock therapy dene par roak lag jaaegi
 It will be used only on the elders only when the District Medical Board permits it and that too after giving anesthesia
 is kanoon ke tahat manorog se grast log ilaaj kaa tarika khud hi tay kar paaenge
 The comments nae kanoon ke mutabik agar koi vyakti baari maansik dabaav ke bich aatmahatya kii koshish kare to use aparaadh nahin mana jayega
 
 
 He will not be sent to jail for one year under section 309 of the Indian Penal Code
 saaf he, bharat ke itihaas main pehali baar aatmahatya ke prayaas ko aparaadh kii shrenee se baahar kiya gaya he
 Until now, the British legal tradition of considering suicide as a crime was continuing
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki bharat sarkaar ne aatmahatya ko manorog ke rup main sweekaar kiya he
 Many people who attempt suicide, their family members do not take them to the doctors for fear of police action, they do not treat them
 ise aparaadh kii shrenee se hataane ke baad aise hajaaron log ab manorog ke ilaaj ke liye visheshgyon ke paas ja paaenge
 In fact, there was no specific policy on mental health in India
 oktober 2014 main pehali baar neshnal mental health polisy laanch kii gai thi
 According to the famous psychiatrist Helen m Farrell, a depression patient takes ten years to ask for help
 tab tak vah sweekaar hi nahin kar paata ki vah marij he
 Farrell also has a speech on this topic in Ted Talk, you can see
 unhone kaha ki bharat main is vishay par mukammal aankade bhi uplabdh nahin hai
 People feel that there is depression, as if there is a season, after Karthik, the fire will come
 maansik rog ke prati jaagrukta kii pehali shart he ki ham sweekaar karen
 There must be a first condition to accept that we know that we are sick

 sansad par hamale ke doshi afjal guru kii kshamaa yachika se sambandhit file dilli sarkaar ne kendriya grih mantralay ko bhej di he

 dilli sarkaar ne haal hi main ise up rajyapal tenzidar khanna kii tippanee ke liye unhen bheja tha, jise unhone grih mantralay ko bhej diya
 Top sources said, "the Lieutenant Governor has sent the file related to Afzal Guru's pardon petition to the Ministry of Home Affairs for further action
 ’’ kendriya grih mantralay ne dilli sarkaar ko is babat apana drushtikon bataane ke liye 16 baar yaad dilaayi, jiske baad hi sarkaar ne file up rajyapal ke daftar ko badhaai
 The Supreme Court upheld the Delhi High Court's decision in 2005, in which the judgment of the lower court was upheld
 nichali adaalat ne 13 disambar 2001 ko sansad par hamale kii sajeesh main afjal kii bhoomika ke liye use maut kii sajaa sunaayi thi
 The file of Afzal has been kept in cold storage with the Delhi government for the last four years and the government took active action on May 6 when Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab was sentenced to death in the Mumbai terror attacks case

 Before the counting of votes in Rajasthan, the question of rebels and independents has suddenly increased
 vasundhara raaje jeet kaa bharosa bhale hi jataa rahi hon lekin phir bhi jeet sakane vaale nirdaleeyon par najar he
 On the other hand, the restless Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is so upset with the exit poll that he said, 'if i lose, no leader will ever work
 'party sutron ke anusaar donon hi dalon kii taraf se hang assembly kii surat main nirdaliyon ko jaipur laane ke liye helicopter tak ke intjaam kiye gaye hai
 The exit poll has increased the worry line of Congress party and Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot

 According to party sources, a list of 17 independents who can win

 Despite working, Gehlot's frustration with not coming to power comes on the tongue again and again
 gahalot kaa kahana he ki agar main haara to phir koi kaam kyon karegaa, sab aish karenge
 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot says that even after working, if the votes are not received then the incoming government will not work, in the name of development, it will not get votes, will do rhetoric, and what else
 haalanki congress ko bharosa he ki rajasthan main hang assembly hi aegi
 In such a situation, Vasundhara Raje is also contacting independents and Congress rebels
 haalanki vasundhara kaa kahana he ki desh main narendra modi kii waisi hi lahar he jaisi immergency kii jepi kii lahar thi
 In such a situation, Congress will not be able to survive anywhere in the country and BJP will get full majority

 People are seeking development everywhere in the country, it is not a matter of caste and religion

 In such a situation, the Rashtriya Janata Party, which is trying its hand in Rajasthan as the third power for the first time, is also confident that it will become the King Maker

 Can you tell on Facebook why you are against them? jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke baad se baukhalaaye pakistan ko ek baar phir se china kaa sahaara mil gaya he
 The whole world, including Muslim nations, did not give a word to Pakistan on the issue of Article 370, but China, with its move, stood with Pakistan against India
 china ne anuchhed 370 par charchaa ke liye sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii band daravaaje (close door) main baithak bulaane kii maang kii thi
 In this regard, China wrote a letter to Joanna Rekonaka, president of the Security Council
 ab jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane par suraksha parishad band daravaaje main baithak karne ja rahaa he
 The meeting will be held at the Security Council headquarters in New York at 7:30 pm Friday (10 am in New York) at the local time in India
 isse pehle pakistan ne anuchhed 370 ke mudde par sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii apatkaaleen open door baithak bulaane kii maang kii thi, jisko ansuna kar diya gaya tha
 Now the question arises here, what is the purpose of the Security Council meeting in closed doors and where is its provision given? What harm will this cause to India? In fact, Rule 55 of the Provisional Rules of Procedure of the United Nations Security Council provides for a closed door private meeting
 yah baithak puri tarah se gopneey hoti he or isamen sirf suraksha parishad ke 15 sadsy hi hissaa lete hai
 In this meeting, even those countries which are related to the issue are not allowed to participate
 is band daravaaje main hone vaali baithak main suraksha parishad ke sadasyon dwaara die jane vaale bayanon kaa koi record tak nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 There is no video recording of this meeting
 lihaaja baithak main hone vaali puri charchaa saarvajanik nahin ho paati he or yah pataa nahin chal paata ki baithak main jis mudde par charchaa hui us par kis desh ne kiske paksh main yaa khilaaf kya bayaan diya?is baithak main hone vaali charchaa kii jaankaree press relies jari karke bhi nahin di jaati he, balki isaki jagah communic jari kiya jaataa he
 In this, very brief information about the meeting is made public
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki suraksha parishad kii band daravaaje main hone vaali baithak kii puri jaankaree sirf sadsy deshon ko hi hoti he
 China and Pakistan may take any nefarious move, but will not be able to succeed in their plans
 is maamle main raksha visheshgy qamar aagaa kaa kahana he ki suraksha parishad ke paanch sthaayee sadsy deshon main se koi na koi kashmir mudde par vito laga degaa or china kii sajeesh safal nahin hogi
 India will not be able to participate in the meeting
 At present, India is neither a permanent member of the Security Council nor a temporary member
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii band daravaaje main hone vaali baithak kii puri jaankaree saarvajanik rup se bharat ko nahin ho paaegi
 In such a situation, China will have full opportunity to strongly advocate for Pakistan and play devious tricks against India
 haalanki suraksha parishad main sudhaar karne or bharat ko sthaayee sadsy banaae jane kii maang lambey samay se chali aa rahi he
 The UN Security Council consists of five permanent and 10 temporary members
 china, france, rus, united kingdom or america sthaayee sadsy hai, jinke paas vito power he
 Veto power means that if any one of these five countries opposes a resolution, then that resolution does not pass in the Security Council

 Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale has invited BSP chief Mayawati to join bjp-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
 unhone kaha ki agar mayawati ko daliton kii vaaki main chintaa he to unhen rajg kaa hissaa ban janaa chahie
 Contrary to all the claims of BJP leaders of winning all 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, Athawale admitted that the alliance of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) would result in loss of 20 to 25 seats to the party, but this would lead to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 There will be no impact on the prospects of forming the Raja government

 unhone kaha, tab main, mayawatiji or ramvilas paswanji milakar kendra sarkaar se daliton ke kalyaan ke liye zyada dhan le sakenge
 SP betrayed SP in Rajya Sabha elections
 Athawale said that SP, which won the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections with the help of BSP, betrayed BSP in the recent Rajya Sabha elections, due to which their candidate lost

 He said that atrocities on Dalits are still happening in the country, but the bjp-led government at the Center is not responsible for this
 congress, sapa or basapa ke shashan main bhi daliton par atyaachaar hote the
 During the Congress rule too, there were incidents of Dalit oppression in the name of cow protection
 unhone kaha ki is mudde ko raajnneeti ke chashme se nahin dekha janaa chahie
 The anti-dalit atrocities law should be strengthened to prevent atrocities on Dalits
 athavle ne uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar dwaara sarkari record merumbedkar kaa naam‘bhimrao raamji ambedkar’ kiye jane ke kadam kii saraahna karte hue kaha ki kuch log isamen prabhu ram kaa naam judane par tikaa-tippanee kar rahe hai, jo bilkul galat he

 ' The real battle of the World Cup will begin now
 donon pool sechaar chaar timen quarter finalmen pahunch chuki hai
 The only mantra to remain in the World Cup in the quarter-final match starting on March 18 will be only one victory
 jeet ke liye har team ji jaan laga degi
 An interesting thing among all of this is that India's semi-final and final match in the World Cup can be held with the two teams with whom it took place in 2011
 semifinal main India vs pakistansamikarana kii baat karen to doosraa semifinal main quarter final-2 kii vijeta team vskvartara final-3 kii vijeta timmuqabla hoga
 The second quarter-final match is to be played between India and Bangladesh, the third is Australia and Pakistan
 cricket panditon kaa maananaa he ki bharat bangladesh ke khilaaf jeet darj karke semifinal main aasaani se pahunch jayega
 But there he will have to face the winning team of the quarter-finals between Australia and Pakistan
 australia kii kismat 'kharaab'world cap main australia ne 6 main se 4 match jite jabaki ek match main use bangladesh ke saath ank saajha karnaa padaa
 Australia may have won their last three matches but this team had to struggle against Scotland too
 pakistan ne sabko chaunkaayawahin pakistan ne shuruaati match ganvaane ke baad jis andaaj main vaapasi kii he use dekhakar lagata he ki wo australia ko bhi dho saktaa he
 Pakistan won four consecutive matches after losing matches against India and West Indies
 in chaar maichon main usne majboot maani ja rahi dakshin africa team ko bhi dhul chataayee
 Pakistan's current form could outweigh the Kangaroos and if that happens, India will face Pakistan in the semi-finals like the 2011 World Cup, besides this will be the first time that there will be two matches between Team India and Pakistan in the same World Cup
 
 srilanka aise pahunch saktaa he final takavahin pehle semifinal main quarter final-1 kii vijeta team (newjiland banaam westeindies) vs quarter final-4 (srilanka banaam dakshin africa) kii vijeta team se bhidegi
 New Zealand have an upper hand in the first quarter-finals and the West Indies may be out in the quarter-finals
 vahiin chauthe quarter final main srilanka kaa form dekhte hue use dakshin africa se zyada majboot team mana ja rahaa he
 In the league matches, South Africa had to face defeat against both India and Pakistan
 iske alaava is team ke saath 'chokars' bhi tag laga hua he
 So the first semi-final match between Sri Lanka and New Zealand could be
 srilanka ke do diggaj khilaadi mahela jayavardhane or kumaar sangakaara kaa ye aakhri world cap he or aise main team newjiland ko haraane ke liye sabakuch jhunk degi
 During the league matches, Sri Lanka had to face a drastic 98-run defeat against New Zealand but after that the Sri Lankan team has made a strong comeback in the tournament
 ab aise main kiwi team ke liye semifinal muqabla itnaa aasaan nahin rah jayega
 This way Sri Lanka can reach the finals
 bharat kii final tak kii rahsemifinal main bharat kaise pahunch saktaa he ham aapako bataa chuke hai

 Mayawati's government was better than this
 unhone kaha tha ‘is mulk main agar koi hukumat karnaa jaanata he to vah sirf mayawati hi hai
 We hope that the way they have saved the Dalits by getting the votes of Dalits, in the same way, they will also do good to Muslims

 NCLAT reinstates Cyrus Mistry as chairman of Tata Sons
 NCLAT has slammed Tata group management with its decision, according to the tribunal
 There was no reasonable reason for the removal of Cyrus Mistry
 The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) gave Cyrus Mistry Has again been reinstated as Chairman of Tata Sons
 NCLAT ne mistre ko teen listed companiyon tisies, tata motors or tata steel ke diarector pad par bhi behaal karne ko kaha he
 Let us know what was the reason that NCLAT considered Cyrus Mistry's side strong and decided against the Tata group
 sirus mistre ko chairman banane ke aadesh ke paalan ko 18 janvari tak roka gaya he, kyonki tab tak tata sans ko supreme court kii sharan lene kaa adhikaar he
 But the order to appoint directors of the remaining three companies will have to be implemented immediately
 gauratlab he ki NCLAT kaa mukhyalay nai dilli main he or supreme court ke ritred jaj es
 J
 mukhopadhyaay iske chairman hai
 The order for the company to be made public again was against the Companies Act 14 by the NCLAT calling Tata Sons to be 'public' to 'private' and it was considered 'partisan' and 'oppressive' for the minority members of Tata Sons
 ensieleti ne register of companyj ko yah bhi aadesh diya he ki vah apane record ko sudhaar kar usamen tata sans ko phir se 'public company' banaae
 The court also said that over the years, the company has taken a number of 'partisan' and 'oppressive' decisions
 jaankaron kaa yah bhi kaha ki mistre kaa hataane ke nirnay ke samay unke kharaab pradarshan ke bare main kuch nahin kaha gaya tha
 This was said later
 sirus mistre disambar 2012 main tata samooh ke chairman bane the
 There was no strong reason for the removal of Cyrus Mistry, in the order of the Theta Suns Board, nothing was said about the poor performance of Cyrus first and later the company gave a statement about this
 buudhvaar ke apane aadesh main NCLAT ne kaha, 'nikat bhavishya main sabhi shairdharakon ke hiton kii behatar raksha ke liye tata sans ke agjicutive chairman or diarector kii niyukti main tata samooh ke memaurity shairdharakon ko minurity group leader (SP group) or kisi bhi aise vyakti kaa paraamarsh lenaa hoga, jin par donon samooh bharosa karte hon
 NCLAT said that making the company public to private without due process means that the nominated members of the 'tata Trusts' treated other members in a 'partisan' manner, including the Pallonji Group of the Board
 is tarah tribunel ne mana ki sirus ko hataane kaa tata samooh kaa nirnay or nae chairman kii niyukti kaa nirnay 'avaidh' tha
 Ratan Tata is believed to play a key role in the removal of Cyrus Mistry from the Tata Sons board in October 2016
 mistre ko tata samooh kii sabhi companiyon ke nideshak pad se bhi baahar kar diya gaya tha
 Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) group of the Mistry family had an 18 per cent stake in Tata Sons, meaning they were a minority shareholder
 is vajah se yah parivaar kuch khaas nahin kar paaya or man masoskar rah gaya
 On the other hand, there was a giant like Tata Trust which had a 66 per cent stake in Tata Sons
 tata sans puure tata samooh kii holding company he
 What was the controversy The Tata Camp and the company board had ousted Cyrus Mistry, alleging wrongful conduct
 tata sans ke board ne 24 oktober, 2016 ko sirus mistre ko chairman pad se hataa diya tha
 Along with this, he had also asked Cyrus to exit other group companies
 iske baad sirus ne group kii 6 companiyon ke board se apana istipha diya
 The use of Article 75 does not make Dharmistri trust in majority shareholders such as Tata Trusts, leading to fears that the company may take further 'biased' and 'oppressive' steps towards minority shareholders using Article 75
 haalanki tata ke vakil abhishek manu singhvi ne is tarah kii ashanka ko niraadhaar bataaya
 He said that Article 75 has never been used yet
 tata sans ke kareeb ek shatabdi puraane artical 75 main company ko yah adhikaar diya gaya he ki vah transfar kii saamaanya prakriya ke paalan kiye bina kisi bhi samay kisi shairdharak ke 'ardinary share' ko company main transfar kar sake
 Mistry's lawyers at the firm had said that this article could be used to force him out of the company or to kneel down even further
 NCLAT ne kaha ki is tarah ke adhikaron kaa istemaal sirf asaadhaaran paristhitiyon main hi company ke hit main kiya ja saktaa he or iske istemaal se pehle likhit vajah bhi bataani hogi

 18 July bharat main pratibandhit aatanki sanghathan indian mujahidin ke do faraar sadsy duniya ke khoonkhaar aatanki sanghathan iesas main shaamil ho gaye hai
 The Ministry of Home Affairs gave this information in the Parliament
 loksabhaa main mangalvaar ko ek sawaal ke likhit jawaab mengrih rajya mantri haribhai parthibhai choudharine bataaya ki aisi khufia jaankaree mili he ki indian mujahidin ke ek yaa do sadsy, jo bharat se kai varshon se faraar the, ve iesas yaa iesael main shaamil ho gaye hai

 input- bhashaa RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, desperate to regain his hold in Bihar, has allotted seats for the Lok Sabha elections, but this has not been done according to his initial assessment
 vah bihar main tathakthith dharmanirpeksh partiyon kaa ek gathbandhan taiyaar karne ke prayaas main hai
 This time the situation is in contrast to 2009, when Lalu Prasad did nothing to the leaders of other parties and held elections on his own terms
 is baar yah sochakar ki argedy, congress, lojpa or ensipi jaisi partiyon ke saath milakar vah narendra modi or nitish kumaar ko jabardast takkar denge, unhone yah gathbandhan taiyaar kiya
 For this, he has bowed a lot
 bataaya jaataa he ki 9 saalon tak satta se baahar rahane ke baad lalu prasad kii soch main bada badlaav aayaa he or vah bihar kii 40 siton main se aadhi anya sahyogi partiyon ko dene ko taiyaar hai
 He is trying his best to strengthen this alliance
 unhone congress ko 10 siten dene kii peshkash kii he
 In 2009, Lalu offered him only 4 seats, after that the Congress had contested alone
 lekin badalte hue vakt ne lalu prasad ko namr bana diya he or vah ab pehle jaise ahankaar main duube hue netaa nahin hai
 Now he is also ready to give 8 seats to Ram Vilas Paswan's party LJP, which was looking towards JDU
 vah aisa isliye kar rahe hai, taaki muslim vot bant na jaae
 Paswan has a good influence on the Muslim community
 dilachasp baat yah he ki lalu kii party ke kuch netaa yah kah rahe hai ki unhen sahyogiyon ke liye itani siten nahin chhodani chahie
 Lalu Prasad is confident that RJD, LJP and Congress will give a tough fight to Modi and Nitish
 iske liye hi vah zyada se zyada siten chhodane ko taiyaar ho gaye hai

 sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko ucchtam nyaayalay ko suchit kiya ki kaperarat gharaanon ke liye sampark kaa kaam karne vaali nira radia or tata samooh ke adhyaksh ratan tata sahit kai pramukh vyaktiyon ke bich ricard kii gayi telephone vaarta ke tepe li karne vaale strot kaa pataa nahin lagaaya ja sakaa he
 The government presented a confidential inquiry report in a sealed envelope before a division bench of Justice GS Singhvi and Justice SJ Mukhopadhyay
 nyaayadhishon ne iske avlokan ke baad kaha ki sankshep main report kahati he ki yah pataa lagaana mushkil he ki kis strot ne ise li kiya
 The judges said, "they (the government) have failed to ascertain the source which leaked these tapes
" ’ nyaayadhishon ke anusaar report main sarkaar ne kaha he ki niyamon ke tahat in tepe kii mul prati sheersh adaalat ke samaksh pesh karne ke baad saare tepe nasht kar diye gaye hai
 Prashant Bhushan, a lawyer for the Center for Public Interest Litigations, an NGO that approached the court to make the entire conversation of telephone tapping public, expressed surprise at the development
 telephone tanping ke dauraan ricard kii gayi vaarta ke ansh li hone ke maamle main sarkaar kii jaanch kii duusari report sunwaayee ke dauraan nyaayalay main pesh kii gayi
 Earlier, the government claimed in the progress report that no government agency was responsible for the leak and that Radia tapes circulated by the media were tampered with
 is report main kaha gaya tha ki tanping ke kaam main sarvice pradaataaon sahit aath se das agenciyaan shaamil thi
 In light of the complaint received by the Finance Ministry on 16 November 2007, a total of 180 days of telephone conversations of Neera Radia were recorded in three phases on the orders of the Income Tax Department
 vitt mantralay ko mili is shikaayat main aarope lagaaya gaya tha ki nira radia ne nau saal ke bheetar teen sau karod kaa vishaal kaarobaar khadaa kar diya he
 After excerpts of Neera Radia's recorded telephone conversations were published and broadcast in the media, Ratan Tata had filed a petition in the Supreme Court requesting an inquiry into the leaking of the tapes
 ratan tata kaa kahana tha ki sarkari str par ricard kii gayi telephone vaarta ke ansh li hone se unke niztaa ke adhikaar kaa hanan hua he

 Principal of all corporation's schools and all area inspectors have been called and instructed
 vahiin skool ke saare staff kaa veriphication ho rahaa he

 DM Brijesh Narayan Singh said that now the Principal as well as the school management and the owners will be taken action if negligence is found in the schools of Noida

 The schools in Delhi were instructed - the teacher should come before the child's admission and the teacher will leave only after the children leave

 'we expect
 
 
 ummid he ek nae or shantipurna america kii
 
 
 'with these things, when President Barack Obama was addressing the country two years ago, he also referred to Gandhi's ideals and the emerging new picture of India in the world
 diwali ke der raat raashtrapati obama mumbai pahunch rahe hai
 Will this be the beginning of a new light or will the india-us relationship remain the status quo
 
 
 yah agle teen dinon main saaf ho jayega
 Seeing the face of defeat at home, President Obama is reaching India with an effort to start a new beginning and to build up the economy of his country
 bhale hi bharat sarkaar america raashtrapati ke is daure se bahut ummiden nahin laga rahi, lekin bharat ke padosi deshon, pakistan or china main is daure ko lekar kaaphi kautuhal rahegaa
 This is perhaps the first time an American President is not spending a few hours in Pakistan with a visit to India
 ise lekar bhale hi bhartiya videsh mantralay santusht na ho, lekin andar hi andar khushi kii lahar jarur hogi
 Even though Obama announced 750 million economic and military aid to Pakistan three months ago, but just before his Indian visit, Obama also said that Pakistan should play an active role in the international campaign against terrorism and Mumbai But India should also help in punishing the terrorists of 26 / 11 attack
 agar ham obama ke in vaktavyon ko sirf unke amalijame ke hisaab se dekhen, to shaayad tasviir saaf nahin hogi, lekin agar ham ise is pariprekshya main dekhen ki obama mumbai pahunchane ke baad 26 / 11 ke hamale main maare gaye logon ko shradhanjali denge, to myne kuch or nikalate hai
 It becomes very clear that America believes that Pakistan is the center of terrorism in South Asia and today, if not tomorrow, Pakistan will have to stop promoting terrorism from its land
 haalanki is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki afghanistan or america samrik jaruraton ke mutabik pakistan kii bhoomika america videsh niti main ahm rahegi
 There are many companies that are opposing US policies on outsourcing
 lekin hamen yahaan sochna chahie ki bigadati arthvyavastha, badhati mahangaai, band hoti companiyaan or betahasha bhaagti berogari kii dar- in tamaam mushkilon se jujh rahe america ke liye ye kahaan sambhav he ki munafa kama rahi bhartiya companiyon or bhartiya profeshnal ke liye wo nai riyaayaten den
 We should learn from Barack Obama that the most powerful person in the world is requesting Indian companies to invest in America in order to strengthen the economy of their country
 lekin aisa lagaat he ki vyapaar niti ke thekedaar bane kuch bhartiya udyogpatiyon ko antarrashtriya bijness kaa yah khel samaj nahin aata
 Another foreign policy issue, that is, there has been a lot of panic about the permanent position for India in the Security Council, but can anyone come up with a statement of the US administration by knowing the foreign policy, in which the US government has made permanent seat for India Should even advocate agar aisa nahin he, to phir bhartiya videsh niti ko aage badhaane ke liye america apni nitiyon main badlaav kyon kare? 
 
 
 More importantly, it is to understand that in today's international environment the role of the United Nations is negligible
 chaahe balkan vivaad kaa masalaa ho, afghanistan-iraq yuddh kii baat ho yaa phir africa main maanviya raahat kaa masalaa, sanyukt raashtra har mudde par vifal rahaa or apane hi prashasnic boj tale charmarata rahaa
 Why is it so important that India needs a permanent place in the Security Council to further strengthen its international image? But some babu of the Ministry of External Affairs are not ready to change their mindset and thinking even after making the foreign policy of Nehru era
 ek or pechida masalaa, jise lekar har visheshgy apni-apni tippanee ham sabon par thope ja rahaa he
 This is the issue of nuclear treaty
 isamen do raay nahin ki raashtrapati baraak obama apni yatra ke dauraan kai america companiyon kaa phayda karaane ke liye bharat sarkaar par jor daalenge ki newclear liblity bill ke jariye kam se kam america companiyon ko nuksaan ho
 
 
 
 or isamen galat bhi kya he? aakhirkaar yah pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii jid thi ki bharat or america ke bich parmaanu sandhi ho, tabhi to apni sarkaar ko daanv par lagaakar bhi bharat sarkaar ne kai riyaayaton ke saath is qaraar par hastakshar kiye or ab jab america prashasan isaki keemat vasuulne par amada he, to hamaare kuch babu trahimam-trahimam kar rahe hai
 Everyone knew that when the Democratic Party came to power, it would charge a bigger price on the nuclear deal than India
 aise main ye bharat sarkaar kii jimmedaari banati he ki wo kisi bhi america company ko, jo parmaanu riector banane main bhartiya companiyon kii madad kar rahi ho, use kisi durghatana ke liye saste main na choda jaae
 When the US has kept its national interest and business benefits paramount for the last 200 years, then who stopped India? In fact, with the economic reforms since the 90s, Indian policy has become like a petitioner's bag
 varanaa kyon jaruri hota ki 1999 main kargil main pakistani ghuspaithiyon ko bhagane ke liye america ke saamne guhaar lagaataa? sansad main aatanki hamale ke baad 10 maheene tak apni sena ko sarhad par tainaat karata or phir america dabaav ke aage jhuk jaataa? 
 
 
 Or would the US intelligence agency depend on the FBI for information about terrorist activities? Why would a thick-hearted shed tears when he was not allowed to meet so-called CIA agent David Headley? It is the weakness of Indian confidence that despite the failure of the Bhopal gas case, Dabhol power project, or Pakistan's use of American weapons during the Kargil War, we are still seen pleading towards Uncle Sam like an innocent child in every difficulty
 hamaare bijness ke aakaa videshi companiyon ko aalu-pyaaj kii tarah kharid sakate hai, hamaara madhyavarg america companiyon ke liye jivan rekha ke samaan he, lekin ham phir bhi ek yachikakarta se aage kuch bhi nahin
 Why don't we have China? If China can, why don't we? uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav shuukravaar ko rajya main mahatvakankshi toll free apatkaaleen ambulance seva '108' kii shuruuaat karenge

 Those who had uploaded a video of the incident on social media platforms after beating four Dalit youths for the 'crime' of skinning a dead cow in Una, Gujarat, their intentions to declare their 'exploits' 'virudavali' was the song, but it was the social media that framed them, sparked anger against them across the country, and the politicians started visiting them one after the other, so that they were victims Show empathy and solidarity with
 
 
 us video main dikhe bhayaavah drishyon ne bhale hi is vakt una ko surkhiyon main pahunchaa diya ho, or har nazar ko isi shahar kii taraf ghuma diya ho, lekin pashchimi gujarat ke saurashtra ilaake main daliton par isi saal hue bahut-se hamalon main se yah sirf ek ghatana he
 
 
 In July itself, Ram Singarkhiya was killed by a mob in Porbandar district to sow castor seeds on a disputed piece of land; And just a few days before that, in the Gondal jail, Beda Sagar Rathod committed suicide, whose family members alleged that the jailer harassed him
 
 
 daliton ke khilaaf bhedbhaav gujarat main dashakon se maujuud rahaa he, lekin saurashtra main yah charam par he, or is kshetra ke saamanti itihaas kaa jwalanth dastauez he
 
 
 Of the nearly 600 princely states that were included in the Indian Union in the year 1956, 188 were from Saurashtra itself
 
 
 lekin baroda ke gaekwad, jinhone ladakiyon ke liye skool banawaye va asprishyata ko khatm karne kii disha main kaam kiye, ke alaava saurashtra ke adhiktar rajput shaasha itane pragativaadee nahin the
 
 
 In their princely states, locally called 'darbar', not only rituals such as 'milk drink' (a practice that results in female feticide, where the baby is dipped in milk and killed after being born) were performed , But they also believe in the 'purity' of the caste system
 
 
 swatantraaa ke uparaant varsh 1952 ke saurashtra bhoomi sudhaar adhinium ne ilaake ke saamaajik swaroop ko badal daalaa, or iske tahat kiraaye par kaam karne vaale kisaanon, mukhyatah patelon, ko zamin par kabze kaa adhikaar de diya gaya, or uske baad unhone kapaas or moongfalee jaisi 'kamau' chizon kii kheti kar rajya kaa sabase rais or sabase prabhaavshaalee samudaay banane main kamyaabi hasil kii
 
 
 But on the contrary, the upper caste dominated bureaucracy and political leadership took care that there was no land in the government records in the name of tribals and dalit cultivators even though it had been allotted to them
 
 
 is tarah kii dhokhadhadi ko barkaraar rakhane kii koshishen lagaataar jari raheen
 
 
 There are 12,500 villages in Gujarat in which Dalits live
 
 
 varsh 1996 main uttari gujarat ke surendranagar jile main based inhen main se 250 gaanvon main enjio navasarjan trust dwaara kiye gaye ek survey main paaya gaya tha ki sarkaar dwaara anusuchit jatiyon ke liye alag se rakhi gai 6,000 acre zamin chaar dashak biit jane ke baavjood daliton ke naam sthanantarit nahin kii gai he
 
 
 Large parts of this land are being illegally cultivated by upper caste farmers
 
 
 is survey ke baad jab navasarjan trust maamle ko lekar court pahunch gaya, tab jaakar rajya sarkaar ko aadesh die gaye ki ye zaminein unke jaays hakdaaron ko saunpi jaaen
 
 
 In the '60s, Dalits and other backward castes forcibly acquired about two lakh acres of land (pasture) in Saurashtra, which the government had acquired from the princely states
 
 
 is andolan ke samay dalit pehali baar patelon ke khilaaf saamne aae the, jo dhire-dhire 'darbaron' kii jagah ilaake kaa sabase prabhavi samudaay banate ja rahe the
 
 
 The next chance of coming face to face came after about a quarter of a century
 
 
 kshatriyon, harijanon, adivaasiyon or muslimon (KHAM) kaa gathjod banaakar congress ko 1980 ke chunaav main mili kamyaabi ne gujarat kii raajnneeti se vaishyon, brahmanon or patidaaron kaa ekadhikaar todakar rakh diya
 
 
 For the first time in history, Yogendra Makwana, a Dalit from Gujarat, was given a place in the Union Cabinet, and made the Minister of State for Home, and for the first time in the Gujarat Cabinet, Amar Singh Chaudhary, a tribal, was included as a Cabinet Minister
 
 
 iske baad aagdi jatiyon ne 1981 or 1985 main kiye aarakshan-virdohi andolanon ke zariye palatwaar kiya, jinke dauraan 300 se bhi adhik dalit maar daale gaye
 
 
 But the reservation provided by the constitution for more than three decades played an important role in improving the economic condition of the Dalits of Gujarat
 
 
 phir 2000 ke dashak ke madhya tak aate-aate ye laabh dikhne band hote chale gaye, or anusuchit jatiyon ke khilaaf hote aparaadhon main lagaataar badhotaree dikhaai dene lagi
 
 
 The reply received from the state police under the Right to Information Act shows that in 2004, nine Dalits were killed and 24 women were raped in caste-related incidents
 
 
 lekin varsh 2014 tak aate-aate ye aankade 27 hatyaon or 74 balaatkaaron main tabdeel ho gaye, donon hi tarah kii vaardaat main lagbhag 200 fisadi badhotaree he
 
 
 (but the shocking fact is that the percentage of convictions in cases filed under the Caste Atrocities Act is extremely low at four per cent
 
 
 ) Sociologist Achyut Yagnik blames it on the discouragement of young and educated Gujaratis from NDTV, which came from the model adopted for development in the state, which set up thick-capital industries, and for unskilled laborers
 So jobs were created, but jobs for the educated did not arise
 
 
 in halaat main aarakshan nitiyon kii vajah se phayda uthaate dikhne vaale, lekin vastav main dalit unki bhadaas kaa nishaanaa ban gaye
 
 
 Navsarjan Trust founder Martin mcewan says that the notion that Dalits are gradually getting all the benefits is wrong
 
 
 unhone NDTV ko bataaya ki rajya ke vibhinn sarkari vibhaagon main anusuchit jatiyon ke liye arakshit 64,000 riktiyaan aisi hai, jinhen ab tak bharaa nahin gaya he, or yah baat sarkaar dwaara pichley saal jari kiye gaye aankadon se hi pataa chali he
 
 
 Dalit leaders say that this is in fact a conspiracy to keep them and their families engaged in the same occupations and occupations - for example, manual scavenging and animal stripping - that were imposed on them because of the exploitative system , So that their social standard does not change
 
 
 lekin yah vah ekmaatr kaaran nahin he, jisaki vajah se gujarat ke dalit maanate hai ki rajya unke viruddh purvaagrah se grast hokar kaam karti he
 
 
 Several rtis filed by activists associated with the community have revealed that since 2001, the government has not released a single rupee to install the statue of Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, the messiah of Dalits
 
 
 or is saal rajya sarkaar ne uttari gujarat ke lagbhag 40 gaanvon main daliton ke liye alag shmashaan ghat banaae jane kii khatir paisa jari kar diya he, jisase yah pakkaa ho jaae ki jati ke daayre dhundhale na paden
 
 
 Dalits make up just seven per cent of Gujarat's total population, and nearly half the national average of 15 per cent
 
 
 iskaa ek arth yah rahaa he ki ve chunavi nateezon ko katai prabhavit nahin kar sakate, or isiilie rajnatik dal unki upeksha karte rahe hai, lekin ab yah badal rahaa he
 
 
 Dalits of Gujarat are now beginning to assert their rights, and are also connected to other people of the community spread across the country, to some extent through social media
 
 
 bhedbhaav se judaa koi bhi maamla turant baanta jaataa he, or takalif ko samuhik rup se mahasoos kiya jane laga he
 
 
 Many believe that the Una incident and Rohit Vemula's suicide in Hyderabad in January before that could affect a large chunk of Dalit votes in the next year's elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab
 
 
 tippaniyan Well, there is a great need for reforms other than this political equation
 
 
 saadhe baarah saal tak gujarat kii gaddi sambhaal chuke or ab desh ke pradhanmantri pad par baithe narendra modi ne varsh 2007 main prakashit apni pustak 'karmyog' main likhaa tha, "valmiki samudaay (dalit upjati) ke liye shauchalayon ko saaf karne kaa kaam aadhyatmik anubhav hi hota hoga
 
 
 ", Indicating their advocacy of caste system
 
 
 pichley ek dashak main jari rahe isi rajnatik khilwaad ne gujarat ke daliton ke virodh prakat karne ke iraade ko majboot kar diya he
 
 
 Since the Una attack, about 30 Dalits have tried to commit suicide, so that their suffering can be addressed
 
 
 khudakushi yaa uski koshish ko ab hataasha se nahin, gusse se upje kadam ke rup main dekha janaa chahie, is baat se koi murkh hi inkaar karegaa
 
 
 The horrifying scenes seen in that video may have made Una in the limelight this time, and have turned every eye towards this city, but this is one of the many attacks on Dalits in Saurashtra region of western Gujarat this year
 Is just an event
 
 
 july main hi ram singerkhiya ko porbandar jile main zamin ke ek vivaadit tukade par arandi ke beej bone ke liye bheed ne kaat-katkar tukade kar maar daalaa tha; or usase kuch hi din pehle, gondal jail main veda sagar rathod ne khudakushi kar lee thi, jiske gharavaalon kaa aarope tha ki jailer use pareshaan kiya karata tha
 
 
 Discrimination against Dalits has been present in Gujarat for decades, but is at its peak in Saurashtra, and is a vivid document of the feudal history of the region

 But most of the Rajput rulers of Saurashtra were not so progressive apart from the Gaekwads of Baroda, who built schools for girls and worked towards eliminating untouchability
 
 
 unki riyasaton main, jinhen sthaneey rup se 'darbar' kaha jaataa he, na sirf 'doodh piti' (kanya bhrunahatya jaisaa parinaam dene vaali pratha, jisamen paidaa hone ke baad bacchee ko doodh main dubokar maar daalaa jaataa he) jaisi rasmon ko nibhaayaa gaya, balki ve log jatipratha kii 'pavitrataa' main bhi vishwaas rakhte hai
 
 
 After independence, the Saurashtra Land Reform Act of 1952 changed the social nature of the area, and under this, the hired peasants, mainly the Patels, were given the right to occupy the land, and after that they made cotton and peanuts like Succeeded in becoming the richest and most influential community of the state by cultivating 'kamau' items

 Efforts to keep up such fraud continued
 
 
 gujarat main 12,500 gaanv aise hai, jinamein dalit basate hai
 
 
 In 1996, a survey conducted by NGO Navsarjan Trust in 250 of these villages located in Surendranagar district of North Gujarat found that 6,000 acres of land set aside for Scheduled Castes by the government, despite the passage of four decades Name has not been transferred
 
 
 is zamin ke bade hisson par oonchi jatiyon vaale kisaanon dwaara gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se kheti kii ja rahi he
 
 
 After this survey, when the Navasarjan Trust reached the court regarding the matter, orders were given to the state government to hand over these lands to their rightful holders
 
 
 '60 ke dashak main saurashtra main daliton or anya pichhadi jatiyon ne jabaran lagbhag do lakh acre gochar (charaagaah) par kabza kar liya tha, jo darasal sarkaar ne rajavaadon se hasil kii thi
 
 
 At the time of this movement, Dalits had come out against the Patels for the first time, which were gradually becoming the most effective community in the area instead of 'darbars'
 
 
 aamane-saamne hone kaa aglaa mauka lagbhag ek-chauthai sadi ke baad aayaa
 
 
 The success of the Congress in the 1980 election broke the monopoly of Vaishyas, Brahmins and Patidars from the politics of Gujarat by forming an alliance of Kshatriyas, Harijans, Adivasis and Muslims (KHAM)
 
 
 itihaas main pehali baar gujarat ke ek dalit yogendra makvaana ko kendriya mantrimandal main jagah di gai, or grih rajyamantri banaaya gaya, or udhar gujarat mantrimandal main bhi pehali baar ek adivasee amarsingh choudhary ko cabinet mantri ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya
 
 
 The Agra castes then retaliated through anti-reservation movements in 1981 and 1985, during which more than 300 Dalits were killed
 
 
 lekin agle teen dashak se bhi adhik samay tak samvidhan dwaara pradutt aarakshan ne gujarat ke daliton kii aarthik sthiti main sudhaar main mahati bhoomika nibhaai
 
 
 Then, by the mid-2000s, these gains began to stop showing, and the crimes against Scheduled Castes continued to increase

 But by the year 2014, these figures had turned into 27 murders and 74 rapes, both of which have increased by almost 200%
 
 
 (lekin chaunkaane vaala tathy yah he ki jatigat atyaachaar adhinium ke tahat darj hone vaale maamalon main doshasiddhi kaa pratishat chaar fisadi par behad kam he

 In these circumstances, due to the reservation policies, the dalits were seen to be taking advantage, but in fact dalits became the target of their anger
 
 
 navasarjan trust ke sansthaapak martin maikwaan kaa kahana he ki yah dharna galat he ki dalit dhire-dhire sara phayda pate ja rahe hai
 
 
 He told NDTV that there are 64,000 vacancies reserved for Scheduled Castes in various government departments of the state, which have not been filled till now, and this has been revealed by the data released by the government last year
 
 
 dalit netaaon kaa kahana he ki yah darasal unhen or unke pariwaron ko unheen peshon or vyavsaayon - udhaaharan ke liye haathon se mailaa uthaanaa va jaanwaron kii khaal utaarna - main lagaae rakhane kii saazish he, jo shoshan karne vaali vyavastha ke boote un par laade gaye the, taaki unka saamaajik str na badal paae
 
 
 But this is not the only reason why Dalits of Gujarat believe that the state works with prejudice against them

 And this year, the state government has released the money to build separate cremation grounds for Dalits in about 40 villages in northern Gujarat, so that the caste boundaries are not blurred
 
 
 gujarat kii kul aabaadi main dalit sirf saat fisadi hai, or 15 fisadi ke rashtriya ausat se lagbhag aadhe hai
 
 
 One of the meanings of this is that they cannot affect the election results at all, and that is why political parties have been ignoring them, but this is changing now
 
 
 gujarat ke dalit ab apane adhikaron ko lekar zyaada jor dene lage hai, or deshbhar main faile samudaay ke anya logon se jude bhi rahane lage hai, kuch had tak soshal media ke zariye
 
 
 Any case involving discrimination is immediately shared, and the problem is being felt collectively

 Narendra Modi, who held the throne of Gujarat for twelve and a half years, now in his book 'karmayoga', published in the year 2007, wrote, "cleaning the toilets for the Valmiki community (dalit sub-caste) is a spiritual experience
 It must have happened

 The same political mess that has continued in the last decade has strengthened the intention of opposing the Dalits of Gujarat

 Discrimination against Dalits has been present in Gujarat for decades, but is at its peak in Saurashtra, and is a vivid document of the feudal history of the region

 The Modi government has taken a big decision for Jammu and Kashmir
 kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne rajyasabha main ek vidheyak pesh kiya jisamen jammu kashmir rajya kaa vibhaajan do centre shasit pradeshon ke rup main karne kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 Home Minister Amit Shah introduced a resolution in the Rajya Sabha stating that not all the clauses of Article 370 of the Constitution will apply in Jammu and Kashmir
 raashtrapati ramnath kovind kii taraf se aadesh jari hone ke saath hi modi sarkaar ne anuchhed 370 ko hataane ke liye sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon kii kanoonee vyakhyaaon kaa sahaara liya he
 In this, present-day Governor's rule in Jammu and Kashmir proved to be an important link
 LIVE: modi sarkaar ne 370 main jammu-kashmir ko mili visheshadhikaar khatm kiye, raashtrapati kii manjurianuchhed 370 ke tahat jammu-kashmir ko vishesh darja diya gaya tha
 With the President's order, now all the provisions of the Constitution will also apply to Jammu and Kashmir
 somvaar ko rajyasabha main kendriya grahamantri amit shah ne adhishuchet aadesh main kaha gaya ki samvidhan ke sabhi praavdhaan, samay-samay par sanshodhit hote hai
 In fact, at present there is no elected government in Jammu and Kashmir
 vahaan rajyapal shashan he or satyapal malik rajyapal hai
 The President's order states that the Governor shall exercise the powers of the elected government and express the will of the State legislature in making recommendations to the President in relation to Article 370
 kashmir se judaa Article 370 sthaayee he yaa asthaayee? jaane samvidhan visheshgyon kii rairashtrapati ramnath kovind ke is aadesh kaa ek or mahatvapurn hissaa yah he ki isamen 'samvidhan sabha' shabd main sanshodhan kiya gaya he, jiskaa arth ab rajya kii 'vidhaan sabha' he
 These amendments were necessary since Article 370, in its sub-clause (3), stipulated that Article 370 may cease to function after the President's order, but before that the recommendation of the 'constituent Assembly' was to him Have gone aadesh ke mutabik rajyapal ko vidhansabha kaa adhikaar diya gaya or phir samvidhan sabha kaa arth vidhansabha main badal diya gaya
 This means that the President can issue these orders on the recommendation given by the Governor
 haalanki rajya is samay rajyapal ke adheen he, isliye rajya vidhanmandal kii sabhi shaktiyaan vartmaan main bharat kii sansad ke paas nihit hai
 In this way Article 370 can be ended by a simple majority with the consent of the President of both houses of Parliament by order of the President
 iske baad rajyapal se bas is par sahmati lee ja sakati he

 Apart from this, the petition related to Ghulam Nabi Azad will now be heard in the Supreme Court on Tuesday
 yani ab jammu-kashmir se judi kai yachikaaon kii sunwaayee mangalvaar ko hi hogi
 On what matter has the petition been filed? Jammu and Kashmir has seen many restrictions since Article 370 was lifted
 isi masale par supreme court main kai tarah kii yachikaayen daayar kii gai hai
 These petitions include petitions such as the manner of removing Article 370, the restrictions imposed here, the restrictions on media in the Valley
 iske alaava gulam nabi azaad ke dwaara ghati main netaaon kii entry par paabandiyon ke khilaaf yachika daayar kii gai thi
 Now this is the only reason for democracy

 He wanted to send three of his supporters to the Legislative Council on a SP ticket

 Bukhari agreed and the SP sent Umar Ali Khan to the Legislative Council

 Vice President of All India Muslim Personal Law Board and religious leader of Shias Drs
 kalbe sadik ne mulaayam singh ko patr likh diya
 They say that people of Shia community are asking me that when 100% Muslims voted for SP, then why Shias were deprived in the Cabinet, Rajya Sabha, Legislative Council? His questions were not answered
 pradesh main musalamaanon kii kul aabaadi kareeb 18 fisadi he or inamen shiyaon kii taadaad chah fisadi ke kareeb he, haalanki alag se unki janaganana nahin hui he
 They are a victim of neglect in terms of participation in power
 ab tak pradesh main keval chaar shiya hi cabinet mantri ban sake hai
 In order to put pressure on the newly formed government, the Shia community has held a big conference in Asifi Imambara in Lucknow
 personal lau board ke sadsy or majalis ulema-e-hind ke mahasachiv moulana saiyad kalbe javwaad kii saraparasti main yojit is jalse main maujuud sapa netaa shivpal singh yadav ne is baat kaa bharosa dilaayaa ki shiyaon ke saath koi bhedbhaav nahin hoga
 Maulana Jawad says, "because of the shia-sunni Ittehad, the SP has been able to form a government in the state
 baavjood unhen unka haq nahin mila he
 My demand is that in the SP government, Shias should get at least one cabinet, two ministers of state and one or two Legislative Council members
 ''moulana javwaad kii adhyakshata main yojit shiya sammelan par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai
 Maulana Yasub Abbas, spokesperson of the All India Shia Personal Law Board, does not justify this strategy of putting pressure on the government
 beete dinon devband ulema ke ek pratinidhimandal ne mulaayam singh se devband ko 24 ghante bijli die jane, kanoon vyavastha main sudhaar, alpsankhyak cote se sarkari padon par hone vaali naamajadagiyon main devbandiyon kaa dhyaan rakhane kii maang kii he
 The Pasmanda Muslim society, which comes from the backward classes, has also expressed displeasure over not getting adequate representation in the government
 mana jaataa he ki pradesh kii kul muslim aabaadi main 85 fisadi pichde musalmaan hai
 During the assembly elections, the National President of Pasmanda Muslim Society, Anees Mansoori, took the membership of SP
 mansuri bataate hai, ''sapa sarkaar main pichde musalamaanon ko unki sankhya ke hisaab se kaaphi kam hissaa mila he
 Due to which there is anger in this society
 '' yah baat mahatvapurn he ki 47 sadasyon vaali sapa mantriparishad main kul 10 musalmaan mantri hai or inamen riyaj ahamed, mehboob ali or ahamed hasan hi pichde muslim samaaj se hai
 BJP State President Dr
 lakshmikant vaajapeyi kehete hai, ''muslim samaaj ke vibhinn virgon kii aguai karne vaale log apane-apane hisaab se daawey karne lage hai
 If the government fulfills these claims, it will increase the courage of Muslim society
 isse sarkaar kii chhavi dhire-dhire muslim tushtikaran pradhan sarkaar kii banati ja rahi he
 "in the last assembly elections, SP gave the highest number of tickets to 82 Muslims, out of which 42 mlas have been formed, which is the highest figure till date
" aise main muslim samudaay kii maangon kii ore se vah munh nahin mode sakati
 Because even after 2012 elections are to be held and in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the SP is powering to stake claim on Delhi throne

 This year on Monday afternoon of 16 May when the mercury touched 44 degrees in Delhi, Gujarat Chief Minister Anandiben Patel came to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 mulaakaat pradhanmantri ke sarkari awaas 7, rescorse road par tay thi
 Last July, when Patel's violent agitation for reservation was instigated in Gujarat, 74-year-old Anandiben had since become embroiled in the fight to save her chair
 halaat se nibatane ke unke tareeke par party ke bheetar gaharaa asantosh tha or unhen hataane kii maang tej hoti ja rahi thi
 His most bitter critic within the BJP, party president Amit Shah, had stepped up the demand to change the chief minister
 ve is baat se pareshaan the ki april main rajya main bheje gaye ek tathyanveshi dal ne paaya tha ki party kaa chunavi aadhaar kaaphi teji se ghat rahaa he
 This study also questioned the leadership of the Chief Minister
 isiilie maamla agar-magar kaa tha hi nahin
 It was just a matter of when Anandiben leaves
 pradhanmantri ke saath aadhe ghante tak chali baithak ke ant main anandiben ne aagrah kiya tha ki unki vidaai sammanjanak honi chahie
 He proposed to relinquish the post of Chief Minister on his 75th birthday i
e
 on 21 November
 modi ne is ichha par apni muhar laga di, baavjood iske ki amit shah kii hi tarah anandiben bhi party ke bheetar modi ke sabase vishwast sahyogiyon main ek rahi hai
 Una boiled as soon as July came
 achaanak ek video viral ho gaya, jisamen gohatya ke kathith aarope main kuch daliton ko nanga karke peetate hue shivasainikon ko dikhaaya gaya
 The Dalit community erupted across the state on this
 vipaksh ke netaaon kaa una main jamghat lagane laga or daliton kaa pradarshan rukne ke bajaae or failane laga
 Then, on 28 July, Modi made a decision
 unhone anandiben ko jo jeevandaan diya tha, use waapas le liya
 a messenger informed Anandiben that after the Dalit movement it was necessary that the message of any action from the Prime Minister should be passed on to the public
 usne mukhyamantri ko bataaya ki modi chaahate hai ki ve swechha se apni kursi chhod den
 Anandiben could not turn down the offer
 agle teen dinon ke dauraan anandiben ne kaaphi teji se jan hitaishi kadamon kii ghoshnaa kar daali, taaki ve apni koi viraasat chhodkar ja saken
 In a public function on July 31, he announced the removal of toll tax from all the roads in the state
 agle din 1 agast ko unhone rajya ke karmchaariyon ke liye saatven vetan ayog kaa elaan kar daalaa
 Patel then withdrew 391 of the 430 police prosecutions against the agitators last year
 unhone 2 agast ko medical or dental collejon main garibi rekha se neeche ke pariwaron se aane vaali ladakiyon ke liye shiksha muft kar di
 After these announcements, he made his resignation public by writing a note on Facebook and through a video post
 shaayad pehali baar kisi mukhyamantri ne is tarah istipha diya hoga
 He wrote in his last letter, "after Chief Minister of Shri Narendra Bhai for more than twelve years, i was chosen to replace him, which was as difficult a task as counting the stars of the sky, but i am proud that he has given Gujarat i did not take any pleasure in maintaining the pace of development which i had pushed forward
 "modi kii kamjor nasanandiben kaa janaa bijepi kii tamaam dikkaton main se mahaj ek ko hal karata he
 It has corrected the atmosphere against his government so that his successor can make his debut on blank paper
 dikkat yah he ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaavon main dedh saal se bhi kam vakt bachaa he
 bjp's Mission 2017 prepared for Uttar Pradesh seemed to be challenging last year itself
 ab ek or sankat aan padaa he
 Prime Minister Modi's own land is in danger
 isi jameen par unhone apni siyaasi pratishtha kaayam kii thi or gujarat model kii neenv rakhi thi—or lagaataar 12 saal 7 maheene tak raaj karke bijepi ke kisi bhi mukhyamantri ke liye ek record kaayam kiya tha (jise ab tak chhattisgarh main raman singh tod sake hai, jinhone 25 july ko apane raaj ke 12 saal 230 din puure kar liye)
 The defeat of the BJP in Gujarat will be a blow to the party and the Prime Minister
 itnaa to tay he ki isse unka prabhamandal paryaapt kshatigrast hoga, jo 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko jeetne ke liye ek anivaary shart he
 Apart from this, the withdrawal of the Congress which has been out of power since 1995 may have another consequence
 iskaa ek matlab yah hoga ki adaalaton main lambit farji muthbhed ke puraane mukademe dobaaraa khul jaaenge, jinamein ek ahm mukadmaa lashkar-e-taiyaba kii kathith aatankwaadi ishrat jahaan kii 2004 main police muthbhed main hui vivaadaaspad hatya he
 Dalit discontent that has emerged against the BJP in Gujarat is more disturbing, due to which the opposition strategy is more than the arbitrary antics of the Sangh Parivar
 yah barason ke sangh parivaar or aresas ke kiye jamini kaam ko nuksaan pahunchayegaa
 There are indications that the Dalit discontent that has emerged against the BJP may spread across the country which could prove damaging for the party in elections
 yah vishesh rup se uttar pradesh main party kii chunavi kismat ko nuksaan pahunchaa saktaa he, jahaan vah puure damakham se pichhadi jatiyon ko lubhaane main juty he
 The political turmoil in Gujarat has left the party restless
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''2019 ke liye oxigen gujarat or upi se hi aani he
 Whatever happens, we have to win Gujarat and UP
 "philhal yah kaam kathin jaan pad rahaa he
 Gujarat's most powerful Patel community, which accounts for about 15 per cent of the state's total electorate, has been agitating for the past one year
 vipaksh modi kii in kamajoriyon ko tad chukaa he
 Last June, Congress electoral strategist Prashant Kishor advised the Congress leadership to target Modi and Amit Shah for their attacks instead of Chief Minister Anandiben
 kishor kaa maananaa tha ki anandiben jitne lambey samay tak mukhyamantri pad par rahengi, congress kii jeet kii sambhaavna utani hi badhegi
 Kishore was given similar advice to supporters of pro-reservation leader Hardik Patel when he met him for a strategic meeting
 vikaas ke gujarat model ko ''13 saal kaa jhootha prachaarya qaraar dene vaale congress ke rajyasabha saansad ahamed patel kehete hai, ''gujarat kii mukhyamantri kaa istipha 2017 ke chunaav main bijepi kii tayshuda haar kaa sanket he
 "gujarat BJP spokesperson Bharat Pandya dismisses any such possibility," "we will return to Gujarat in 2017 with an overwhelming majority
" ekaadh oonch-neech se gujarat model par asar nahin padataa
 The Congress dreams of defeating us before every assembly election, but is proved wrong every time
 "anandiben kaa janaa jamini vaastaviktaaon ko nahin badal saktaa
 From April this year, the alarm bells had started ringing in the bjp's Ashok Road headquarters in Delhi
 party mahasachiv om maathur or sachiv ve
 Satish went to visit the state in march-april after the Patidar community agitation to assess the party's popularity
 unhone paaya tha ki anandiben ke raaj main party kii lokapriyata rasaatal main chali gai
 His leadership ability was being questioned for several reasons
 maathur ne is survey kii report april main pradhanmantri or amit shah ko di or samaadhaan ke taur par apni ore se netritv parivartan kaa sanket de diya
 Two months earlier in February, allegations had surfaced that the state government had given away 400 acres of land in Gir forest of mills to her husband's company, benefiting Anandiben's daughter Anar Jayesh Patel in 2009
 yah baat alag he ki us vakt anandiben mukhyamantri nahin thim
 Anandiben is a hardworking woman who has traveled 60,000 km in the state within two years, visiting each of the 33 districts five times which is a record in itself
 unhone kuposhan, mahila shashaktikaran or svachh bharat jaise kshetron main rajya ke suchakaankon main sudhaar kiya
 Under his rule, the rate of suicide of farmers also came down
 2014 main 45 kisaanon ne khudakushi kii thi, jabaki 2015 main sirf 3 kisaanon ne khudakushi kii
 However, his distance with the party and the bureaucracy adversely affected his steps
 unki sarkaar ne sharaab kii lat or gharelu hinsa ke khilaaf mahilaon ko shashakt karne ke liye taluka str par mahila samitiyon kaa jo prastaav rakhaa tha, vah jameen par nahin utar sakaa kyonki in samitiyon ke adhikaar kaa dayera spasht nahin tha
 As a result, the Thakor Sena of OBC leader Alpesh Thakor, under the prohibition program, developed the concept of "mass raid", which led to the initiative of women committees
 iske alaava, modi kaa pasandida video link shikaayat niptaan kaarykram ''swaagat online" bhi anandiben ke raaj main kamjor pad gaya
 Says sociologist Gaurang Jani, who teaches at Gujarat University, "most areas, from law and order to government, have weakened under his rule
 unke paas ek bada mauka tha, lekin ve apana prabhaav nahin chhod pain kyonki unke bheetar karishme kaa abhaav tha
 "anandiben was also weak in terms of dialogue
 rajya main bijepi ke vartmaan adhyaksh vijay roopaani or unke purvavarti aar
 C
 faldu ke saath anandiben ke rishte thande the
 Under his reign, the relationship between the party leadership and the party workers, including the government, also weakened
 unke mukhyamantri banane ke ek saal baad bhrashtachar ke aarope mukhar ho gaye
 The most recent case is of an unnatural audio clip in which a senior BJP leader tells the party MLA that the Chief Minister has got a land deal in which many people have got a lot of money
 jaise-jaise nijee aaropon kii jhadi lagati gai, nawachaari yojanaon ke jariye arjeet unki lokapriyata par batta lagata gaya
 These schemes include 50 per cent reservation for women in municipal elections, 33 per cent in police recruitment, construction of the highest number of toilets in Gujarat under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, transparency in the revenue sector and fighting corruption in the appointment of primary teachers
 Was
 unki vishwasaneeyata par ai aanch ke baad naukarshahi main bhrashtachar kaaphi teji se badha
 If public perception is believed, corruption in some areas reached its peak
 varisht rajnatik vishleshak vidyut thaakar kehete hai ki anandiben na chaahate hue bhi congress ke liye bhartee agent kii bhoomika main aa gayi
 He says, "this happened because one of his image was constantly falling apart, secondly he was constantly making political mistakes, which was making the way for Congress to return to power
" "unke istife ke baad hardik patel ne jo bayaan diya, vah vipaksh kii niraashaa ko jaahir karata haih ''unhone rajya kii janata ke saath khilwaad kiya he or avyavashtha failaa di he
 Why are she running away from her responsibilities now? "gujarat Congress in-charge Bharat Solanki says she was forced to resign because" there were allegations of corruption against her family
 " amit shah ne unki vidaai main bhi ek sadgun khoj nikaala, ''unhone 75 varsh kii umr ke siddhant ke mutabik kursi chhodie kaa faisla lekar ek nazeer pesh kii he
 "what will Modi have to do to rebuild the bjp's crumbling fort in the road of 2017? The priority will be to bring back the Patels, who are the bjp's primary vote bank in the state
" anandiben kii kadi karravaayiyon—ekaadhik mukademe or hardik patel ke khilaaf rajdroh ke mukademe, jiske chalate unhen nau maheene jail main bitaane pade, ne is samudaay ko bijepi ke khilaaf khadaa kar diya he
 Apparently, the mercury of the Patel community may come down after most of the cases are now withdrawn by them
 phir bhi is samudaay ko bijepi ke saath laana itnaa aasaan kaam nahin hoga, kyonki aarakshan sambandhi unki ataarkik maang ko puraa karnaa mushkil he or duusare, hardik patel kii nijee mahatvakankshaon ne unhen congress se lekar arvind kejariwal tak modi ke tamaam siyaasi dushmano ke paale main dhakel diya he
 Modi would need an intermediary to deal with the Patels, who would isolate Hardik Patel as a strategy and in turn win the support of the Patel community
 november, 2015 ke jila panchayat or taluka panchayat chunaav main haalanki samooche gramin patel samudaay ne party kaa daaman chhod diya tha, jisase bijepi ko kareeb do darjan jila panchayat siton kaa nuksaan hua or kamjor congress main achaanak jaan aa gai
 The BJP will have to work hard to get the Patels from the rural areas in their hands
 iske alaava, rajya main bijepi or sangh kii mashinari dwaara poshit dalit vot bhi una main hui 11 july kii ghatana ke baad hue dalit andolanon ke chalate chhitakane kii sthiti main aa chukaa he
 There has been a five-fold increase in the number of atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Tribes in the state
 rajya main daliton ke khilaaf utpeeda kii sabase zyada ghatnaayen hui hai, jo 2014 main 1,130 se badhkar pichley saal 6,655 tak pahunch chuki hai
 Here too, some tough measures and a skilled negotiator are needed so that Dalits can be healed in Gujarat and its message can be spread across the country
 gujarat main ''jameen jotane vaale kii" ke siddhant ke tahat daliton ko aavantit jameen par aaj bhi kai gaanvon main savarna hi kheti kar rahe hai
 If the government takes strict action in this direction, the ownership of their lands can be restored to the Dalits
 haalanki iskaa ek nateeja yah hoga ki agadi jatiyon ke kisaan party se bidak jaaenge or daliton ke saath unke takaraav bhi bad jaaenge
 It would be dangerous for Modi in both cases
 gujarat main rajkaaj ko durust kiya janaa hoga, jo naukarshahi ke bhrashtachar ke liye kukhyat he
 This means that the new state government, which should come out, remove the system and appoint clean and working IAS and police officers in important positions

 narendra modi ne disambar, 2012 ke chunaav se chaar maah pehle hi apana chunaav prachaar abhiyaan shuru kar diya tha
 He won 115 out of 182 seats in the assembly elections
 yah unke akele prayaas kaa parinaam tha, jisamen ve lagaataar chaar maheene tak athak prachaar karte rahe
 This was the strongest campaign of Modi's political career, which he himself left behind from the 2014 campaign
 kai log ashanka jaahir kar rahe hai ki kya pradhanmantri 2017 main itnaa vyapak prachaar abhiyaan chalaa sakenge? rajya bijepi ke netaaon ko vishwaas he ki party or khaskar modi ke liye saal bhar kaa vakt nuksaan bharpai ke lihaaj se paryaapt he
 Former minister and senior BJP leader Indervijay Singh Jadeja says, "his message of good governance and the fact that till now the central government has not been involved in a single case of corruption enhances his aura

 It should not be forgotten that the BJP has a system of dedicated workers who work till the booth level

 16-year-old Zaira Wasim, who plays Chhoti Geeta Phogat in 'dangal', got into a controversy due to a photo of her and Alam is now not taking the name of the controversy
 16 saal kii jaayra kashmir kii rahane vaali hai or haal hi main 10 veen board kii pariksha main unhen 92 pratishat ank mili hai
 Even after this achievement, Zaira became a victim of social media troll and adding a new link to the controversy, folk singer Gayini Malini Awasthi has taunted Aamir Khan's wife Kiran Rao
 malini ne ek fasebuk post ke madhyam se aamir khan kii patni ke 'ashishnutaa' ke chalate bharat chhodane vaale vivaad par sawaal uthaae hai
 Malini Awasthi has written a post on Facebook in this matter
 # zaayravasimavivaad 'aamir Khan's riotous young actress Zaira Wasim was equally paranoid due to the fanatics, but when she took a picture and posted on Twitter after a formal meeting with Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, Zaira was highly criticized
 Hunted and they panicked and deleted the picture and posted a long apology
 gauratlab he ki mahabuuba mufti ne zaayra jaisi betiyon ko kashmir ke liye nai ummid bataaya he
 After Muhammad Shami, Muhammad Kaif, now the context of Zaira is a living example of increasing bigotry and intolerance
 zaayra abhi bahut choti he, ek pratibhashali abhinetri kaa is kattarta se ghabara kar bina kisi galati kii maafee maangana behad durbhagyapurna he
 But i am looking forward to one thing
 
 
 
 
 
 After discovering Aamir Khan's own, very promising Zaira, tell his wife Kiran Rao what to say now, also Aamir Khan
 kashmir kii ek maasoom beti ke saath dikhaai gai is 'ashishnutaa' par unhen bharat chhodane kaa man karata he yaa nahin
 Aamir Khan must tell the country what progressive Kiran Rao thinks
 ' Many people are supporting this post of Malini and it is being shared a lot
 bataa den ki aamir khan ne aaj aaj hi jaayra ke liye apana paksh rakhte hue likhaa, 'maine zaayra kaa bayaan padhaa or main samaj saktaa hum or kalpana kar saktaa hum ki usne kin halaat main ye sab likhaa hoga
 Zaira
 
 i want to tell you that we are all with you
 acchhee baat yah he ki tum jaise budhimaan, yuva, pratibhavan, mehnatee, sammanjanak, dusron kaa khyaal rakhane vaale or himmati bachche, sirf bharat main hi nahin, duniya bhar ke bacchon ke liye role model hai
 You are my role model too
 ' Aamir also wrote that i appeal the most to leave her alone and keep in mind that she is just a 16 year old girl who is trying to do something good with life on her own
 tippaniyan (also read - These stars, including geeta-babita, supported 'dhakad' girl Zaira Wasim) bataa den ki is dangal girl ne dasvin board main 92 pratishat paane ke baad, jammu-kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne usase mulaakaal kii or use badhai di
 Mehbooba Mufti said that she is a role model for the youth of Kashmir
 jaayra ne mahabuuba mufti ke saath apana ek photo bhi post kiya
 After this many separatists trolled Zaira for this
 jaayra ne iske turant baad vah photo hataa kar fasebuk par ek maafinama post kiya, jise baad main unhone hataa bhi liya

 It is noteworthy that Mehbooba Mufti has given daughters like Zaira a new hope for Kashmir
 mohammad shami, mohammad caff ke baad ab jaayra kaa prasang badhati hui kattarta or ashishnutaa ke jite jaagate udhaaharan hai
