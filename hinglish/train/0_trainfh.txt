 dekhen kya he puraa maamla
 He once again gave a sample of how dangerous striker Lionel Massey can be while playing for Barcelona's team
 unhone bhalaa kii teji or furti se ek ke baad ek teen gol daage, or isi ke saath spanish footbal lig laa liga main maisi ne 21veen hetric puri kii
 At the beginning of this season, Macy's was not in full rhythm, and it seemed that Macy's mind was no longer in the ground
 bahut sambhav he ki worldcup footbal main argentina ko champion nahin banavaa paane kii kasak ne unke man main footbal ke prati viraag utpann kiya ho, lekin jaldi hi maisi isse ubar gaye
 As la-liga Parwan is climbing, the magic of Macy, who works with his left foot, is also returning
 unhone barsilona kii ore se khele pichley chaar maichon main teen hetric jamaa di hai
 During this third hat-trick, Massey has also surpassed his goalscoring score of 400 for Barcelona, and now has 402 goals in league matches for Barcelona
 is dauraan maisi apane puraane andaaj main nazar aae
 Run with short passes
 
 
 dhime-dhime move banaate
 
 
 Lightning fast shots in front of the goal post
 
 
 maisi ko barsilona kii ore se gol banaate dekhte hue aap bas mantrmugdh ho jate hai
 
 
 Just like you get lost in the things you like
 
 
 yahi maisi kaa karishma he
 On the one hand Massey has returned to his rhythm, on the other hand the magic of Christian Ronaldo is also intact

 He scored his 23rd hat-trick in La Liga playing for Rial Madrid, and also completed 200 goals for Riyal in the meantime
 zaahir he, spanish footbal lig kaa romaanch maisi or ronaldo jaise khilaadiyon kii maujuudagi kii vajah se hi aasmaan par hota he
 There is no doubt that both of them are the most dangerous strikers of the present time, but both of their successes have a stain of not repeating the charisma for their respective countries
 isaki iklauti vajah yahi he ki club footbal main inkaa saath dene ke liye duniya ke behtareen khilaadiyon kii toli jamaa hoti he, or har jagah duniya ke behtareen khilaadi khel rahe hote hai, so, isi sthiti kii vajah se in donon kaa jaadu bhi nikharkar saamne aata he
 On the other hand, playing with the teams of Argentina and Portugal, Massey and Ronaldo have the same level, but the level of the rest of the players decreases, and that is why neither Messi nor Argentina can win the World Cup
 lekin is daag ke baavjood maisi or ronaldo footbal ke aasmaan par chamakdaar taare kii tarah chamak rahe hai

 kaarykram ke udghaatan bhaashan main india today group ke chairman arun puri ne sabase pehle 'panchayat aaj tak' main jute mehmaanon kaa swaagat kiya
 He said, 'india and we are moving towards another national election
 ye 16waan aam chunaav he
 During this time India Today Group has always tried something new, something different positive
 is myne main ye chunaav hamaare liye khaas hai
 'arun Puri said,' We were the first to start the Opinion Poll in the 1980s and we can proudly say that we have been right in the election prediction
 ek broadcaster ke rup main 'aaj tak' ne 1998 ke aam chunaav main 'aapkaa faisla' naam se chunavi nateezon par 72 ghante kaa lagaataar kaarykram pesh kiya tha
 Even when we were with Doordarshan in the 1999 election, we presented a continuous program of 72 hours in both Hindi and English
 2001 main ajtak ke 24 ghante kaa news channel banane ke baad bhi sabhi chunaavon main ellection kawarej main ham sabase aage rahe

 chunaavon par ye pehla kaarykram tha jab ham 100 ghante tak live rahe, jab tak ki sarkaar kaa gathan nahin ho gaya
 Trying to do something different in every election has become a tradition for us
 ’iske saath hi arun puri ne sabhi kaa panchayat aaj tak main swaagat kiya or kaha, ‘main aap sabhi kaa ek or chunavi kawarej ‘panchayat aaj tak’ main swaagat karte hue khushi mahasoos kar rahaa hum

 Also, this election is also special because before this the regional leaders have never looked so strong
 in sabake alaava arvind kejariwal ek sansanikhej raajnneetik shakhsiyat ke rup main ubhare hai
 'he said,' This is also the first time in the Indian elections that a year old political party has forced the electoral giants to rethink their strategy
 kisi ke liye mistar kejariwal khel kharaab karne vaale hai, to kai logon ke liye wo ek maseehaa hai
 Of course this issue will be a part of 'panchayat Aaj Tak'
 ’ arun puri ne ummid jataai ki ye chunavi jang partiyon ke bich muddon par aadhaarit hogi
 She said, 'today, we will talk about big topics like corruption, inflation, unemployment, women empowerment and security
 main is maukey par ye bhi kahana chaahunga ki durbhagyavash in chunaavon main media par ek paksheeya hone yaa phir corporate hiton ke tahat kaam karne ke aarope lag rahe hai

 agar aap healdi lifestil main bharosa karte hai to ho na ho zeus aapaki diet kaa ek jaruri hissaa hoga
 Some people like to drink packed fruit juice and some people take fruit juice at home
 packed zeus chaahe jitani bhi acchhee quality kaa ho, taaje falon ke zeus se unka koi muqabla nahin
 But if you remove juice at home, then you should also take care of many things
 varanaa sehat banane ke bajaay bighad bhi sakati he
 While taking out the juice, keep these things in mind: 1
 healdi rahane ke liye aap zeus to rojaanaa nikaalte honge lekin kya jusar ko niyam se saaf bhi karte hai? agar aap rojaanaa jusar kii safai nahin karte hai to usamen bacteria punap sakate hai
 In such a situation, the juice you take out will also be unhealthy
 aise main jusar ko rojaanaa saaf karnaa bahut jaruri he
 2
 bahut se aise fruit zeus hai jisamen ham chini milaate hai
 In such a situation, the level of sugar in the body also increases at times
 koshish kiijie ki zeus ko uske natural rup main hi len
 3
 agar zeus pinaa aapaki aadat he to koshish kiijie ki jab bhi zeus pien, taaja hi pien
 It is not right to store the juice and drink it later
 bahut se zeus to aise hote hai jinhen turant pinaa to phydemand hota he lekin baad main pine se uskaa koi phayda nahin rah jaataa
 4
 agar aapmixd zeus pinaa pasand karte hai toapako falon or subjiyon kaa sahi or healdi mail bhi pataa hona chahie
 For this, talk to the dietician so that you know the synergy of fruits and vegetables
 5
 This is not true if your juice gives all the fibers an edge
 falon ke fibers main kai poshak tatv hote hai
 In such a situation, too much filter juice will not be right
 zeus kaa palpi hona jaruri he tabhi puraa phayda mil sakegaa

 Vice Admiral Bimal Verma has withdrawn his petition challenging the appointment of Vice Admiral Karambir Singh as the next Naval Chief
 unhone yah faisla ek sainya nyaayaadhikaran kii salaah ke baad liya he
 Verma, commander-in-chief of the Andaman and Nicobar Command, had on Monday approached the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) and asked why his name was not considered for the next naval chief even after being the most senior
 sutron ke anusaar eft ne verma se kaha ki unhen apni shikayaton kaa nivaaran aantarik upayon se kar lenaa chahie jiske baad unhone apni yachika waapas le lee
 The AFT said that if it is not satisfied with the internal measures, then it can come to the tribunal
 verma ne somvaar ko yahaan eft main apni yachika main jaananaa chaha tha ki sarkaar ne unki varishthata kii andekhi kyon kii or vaais admiral karambir singh ko aglaa nausena pramukh kyon niyukt kiya he
 The government made Singh the next Naval Chief last month
 vah admiral sunil lamba kii jagah lenge jo 30 may ko sevanivrutt honge
 The government has selected on the basis of merit and has not followed the tradition of appointing the most senior officer to the post
 admiral verma ab isko lekar raksha mantralay main vaidhanik shikaayat karenge or agar unki shikaayat nahi suni jaaegi to phir apat kaa darwaja khat khatayenge
 Explain that the tribunal asked the petitioner to appeal against his decision to the government under the rules contained in the First Navy Act
 admiral verma ne ye kadam eft kii salaah ke baad hi uthaaya
 On behalf of Bimal Verma, his daughter Riya appealed
 justise virendra singh ne maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue diya aadesh sabhi legal remedies kaa istemaal pehle karnaa chahie, lihaaja bimal verma ke vakil ko bharat sarkaar ke paas apil kerani chahie ,uske baad hi ham kuch kar sakate hai
 Bimal Verma's daughter Riya says that if she does not get justice from the government, she will come to court again
 sarkaar ne jis tarah se unke kaam or varishthata ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya he usase unako kaaphi dukh pahunchaa he
 Although the Chief of the Army is made on the basis of seniority, but the current government appointed General Bipin Rawat as the Chief of the Army Staff in December 2016 when two senior lieutenant generals were present

 madhya pradesh ke ek bijepi saansad evam party pravaktaa film padmavati ke virodh main itane neeche tak chale gaye ki unhone desh ke filmkaaron ke bare main bahut hi behuda bayaan de daalaa
 In his comment posted on Facebook, BJP MP from Ujjain, Professor Chintamani Malviya has said, "what do the filmmakers of the houses of women who change their habits everyday know what is Jauhar?" Not only this, he has also used abuses for filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali
 gauratlab yah he ki professor chintamani madhyapradesh bijepi ke pravaktaa bhi hai
 Professor Malaviya has said in this post, 'I strongly oppose and boycott the film Padmavati
 apane shubhachintakon se anurodh karata hum ki is film ko bilkul na dekhen
 It is shameful and disgusting to tamper with history for the greed of a few money making a film
 'saansad ne kaha he, 'har bhartiya nari kii adarsh, rani padmavati ji par bharatiyon ko garv he
 Rani Padmavati, along with thousands of women, burnt herself in the fire for her saintliness and pride of the country and society
 use tod-marod kar dikhaanaa vastav main is desh kaa apmaan he
 "only the language of shoes is understood! He has written," People like Bhansali do not understand any other language
 in jaise logon ko sirf juute kii bhashaa hi samaj aati he
 This country will not bear the insult of Rani Padmavati
 ham gauravshaalee itihaas ke saath chhedhkhani bhi bardaasht nahi kar sakate
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali has made Padmavati film on the wrong history written by Alauddin Khiljike court poets
 yah na sirf galat he, balki nindaneey he
 Filmmakers whose homes change their habits every day, what do they know what is Jauhar? Sanjay Bhansali's mental deformity will not be tolerated in the name of expression
 'film padmavati kaa desh ke kai hisson main virodh kiya ja rahaa he
 Karanchi army in Rajasthan has been very vocal against this

 When asked if the Congress would be excluded from the alliance, Yadav said, 'why are you talking about imaginative things
 aap gathbandhan kaa matlab samajhie or yahaan kya ho rahaa he
 On the other hand, there are reports that BSP chief Mayawati and Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Akhilesh Yadav have come close to finalizing the seat-sharing formula in view of the Lok Sabha elections this year
 sutron ne yah jaankaree di
 SP sources said that Yadav met Mayawati to discuss the final aspects of the proposed alliance

 Uttar Pradesh has a total of 80 Lok Sabha seats
 sutron ne bataaya ki shesh siton ko congress, rashtriya lokdal or anya choti partiyon ke liye choda jaayegaa
 If this grand alliance is ready, it will be a big blow for the BJP as well as the Congress
 sutron ne bataaya ki mayawati ne shanivaar ko bispi ke sanyojakon kii baithak bulaai he
 The BSP and SP may soon decide the grand alliance candidates for Amethi and Rae Bareli
 rashtriya lokdal (areldi) ko upi ke mahagathbandhan main teen siten di jane kii sambhaavna he
 Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati are not in the mood to field candidates in Amethi and Rae Bareli

 It is believed that Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati will meet again next week

 Growth rates have fallen and China has lost the fastest growing economy from India
 The fiscal deficit for the entire year in the first two months of the fiscal year touched 52 per cent of the budget estimate
 uddeshy ghate ke lakshya ko jidipi ke 3
 4 percent, but rising spending and shrinking revenue coupled with pressure to spend more means that India is slipping on the inflation front, a percentage point lower than the consumer price index (CPI) targeted four percent

 Om's tattoo is done on the back of a Muslim prisoner in Tihar Jail
 is maamle main jab aaj tak ne padtaal kii to pataa chalaa ki peedit vyakti is maamle main pehle hi shikaayat kar chukaa he
 The victim's name is being described as Shabbir
 muslim yuvak ke vakil jagmohan ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya ki shabbir ne shikaayat kii ki barrack main induction chulhaa nahin kaam kar rahaa he
 Jailed Superintendent Rajesh Chauhan was beaten up badly by the complaint
 adhikari ne iske baad yuvak kii peeth par ek metal ke jariye om kaa nishaan bana diya
 It is alleged that the metal bearing the mark of Om was first heated and then left on the young man's back
 tasviir dekhne se saaf jaahir ho rahaa he ki pehle yuvak kii peeth par ghaav bana hoga phir nishaan chap gaya hoga
 It is alleged that the jail administration forcibly fasted the boy for two days and kept him hungry
 shikaayat main is baat kaa bhi zikr he ki yuvak se kaha gaya ki usne do din navaratri kaa vrath rakh liya he or ab vah hindu he
 The youth was also abused for allegedly being a Muslim
 aaropee yuvak kii ore se vakil jagmohan ne kadakadduma court main shikaayat darj karai he
 In the court, the judge has also seen the mark on the back of the victim's youth
 court ne is sambandh main tihaad jail prashasan ko notice bhi jari kiya lekin iske baad bhi prashasan kii ore koi court main maujuud nahin hua
 The next hearing in this case is on Monday
 is sambandh main jail prashasan kaa kahana he ki court ne diaiji tihaad se maamle kii jaanch 2 din main court main pesh karne ko kaha he
 So far, those charged in the investigation are less likely to be correct

 america antariksh agency ke sabase puraane antariksh yaan discovery ne somvaar ko antarrashtriya antariksh stesan (ieses) se apane antim abhiyaan kii vaapasi uda bhari
 After spending eight days in the ISS, Discovery made it at noon at international time, according to the news agency DPA
 37 baje antim udaan bhari
 After Discovery's final flight, ISS Commander Scott Kelly told the six crew members that their journey had been successful and that there would be a lack of discovery in the coming days
 unhone kaha, "discovery ek mahaan antiraksh yaan he or isane anya yanon kii apeksha ieses kii kahin zyada madad kii
 " aatmavishvaas vah bhaavana he, jo insaan ke hausale ko agamya oonchaaiyon tak bhi aasaani se le ja sakati he
 
 
 This has been proved by the 26-year-old Aamir Hussain of Kashmir, who by his will has become an example of indomitable courage and combative attitude for the world
 
 
 halaat ne jo kuch bhi aamir ke saath kiya, uske baad kisi kaa bhi apane paanvon tak par khadey hona aasaan nahin tha, lekin aamir ne haar nahin maani or halaat ko apane haq main modakar ek misaal kaayam kii
 
 
 Watch this video of Aamir uploaded to youtube by Barcroft TV, and we promise, you will be forced to rub your eyes in disbelief
 
 
 darasal, bachapan main hue ek haadase ne aamir se uske donon haath chin liye the, lekin ab aamir is video main aapako bilkul saamaanya logon ke saath behad 'asaamaanya' tareeke se cricket kheltaa dikhaai degaa
 
 
 Actually, at the age of eight, Aamir's hands were hit by the saw machine (wood sawing machine), after which the hands had to be cut off from the shoulder
 
 
 bat banane kaa kaam karne vaale aamir ke pita bashir ahamed ne bete ko bachaane ke liye sab kuch bech daalaa
 
 
 When Aamir came out after being in the hospital for three years, he was not disappointed or frustrated, but had the passion to start life afresh
 
 
 aaj aamir shot lagane main maahir cricketer maane jate hai, or yahi nahin, kashmir kii paara cricket team ke captain bhi hai
 
 
 It was probably because of his father's profession, but Aamir was fond of cricket since childhood
 
 
 haathon ke jane ke baad bhi cricket se lagaav kam nahin hua, or unhone balle ko pakadaney kii nayaa hi tarika ijad kar daalaa
 
 
 Aamir plays the bat between his shoulders and his throat, and is said to be adept at making great shots
 
 
 aamir gendbaaji bhi karte hai
 
 
 It is surprising
 
 
 ? lekin sach yah he ki vah pair kii anguliyon ke bich gend ko fansaakar spin bowling bhi kar lete hai
 
 
 And yes, even during fielding, Aamir stays in the field, because he has also mastered fielding by stopping the ball with his feet
 
 
 cricket khilne ke alaava aamir pairon kii madad se likh bhi lete hai, or painting tak kar pate hai
 
 
 Aamir, who has done his schooling till 12th, is not dependent on anyone, and does all his work - such as shaving, bathing, wearing clothes - on his own
 
 
 khayr, kaaphi baaten ho gayi, ab aap is 'vilakshan aatmavishvaas' se bhare aamir kaa yah video dekhie
 
 
 The report of the National Human Rights Commission on Kairana amidst the stirring of elections in Uttar Pradesh has rekindled the whole issue
 maanavadhikaar ayog kii report main kaha gaya he ki kairana se hindu pariwaron kaa palaayan hua kyonki vahaan kanoon-vyavastha durust nahin thi
 The report also said that some Muslim youths used to molest the daughters-in-law of Hindus in Kairana and there was terror of hooliganism

 Ajit Singh said that about three and a half families were being asked to flee from Kairana, but the NHRC has prepared a report after talking to only 6 families
 hukum singh kaa dabadabaa badhegamana ja rahaa he ki enechaarsi kii report ke baad bijepi ke netaa hukum singh kii sthiti majboot hogi kyonki unhone hi sabase pehle kairana ke maamle ko uthaakar badi sankhya main palaayan ke mudde ko uthaaya tha

 He said that when the vote was to be held here on May 19, i wanted to visit Kashi

 The Shiv Sena has once again targeted the Sangh through its mouthpiece Saamana
 shivasena ne sangh ke mukhpatr main chape bharat ke nakshe kii galati ko aade haath liya he
 The Shiv Sena, in its mouthpiece Saamna, has called the mouthpiece Organizer of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh a fool
 saamana ne apane shuukravaar ke ank main sangh ko khub khari-khoti sunai he
 The Shiv Sena has written that the RSS mouthpiece Organizer has put Kashmir in the jaws of Pakistan
 hameshaa rashtriyata kaa paath padhaane vaala sangh kaa mukhpatr asal main moorkhpatr sabit hua he
 Significantly, the latest issue of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's mouthpiece has come on the market
 is ank main saarc deshon kaa ek map chapa gaya he jisamen kashmir kaa ek bada hissaa pakistan ko saunp diya gaya he
 The RSS has rectified this mistake in its online issue, but the print of the mouthpiece has arrived in the market
 sangh kii isi galati par uski har jagah kirakiri ho rahi he
 The Shiv Sena has written in the face that much controversy is going on regarding Mufti Mohammad Sayeed
 upar se aise maahaul main sangh ke moorkhpatr ne kashmir ko pakistan ke jabade main daalkar maahaul ko or kadava kar diya he
 Apparently after this action, the laddoos in the minds of devils sitting in Pakistan must be bursting

 The impostor Baba Virendra Dev Dixit, who runs the Ayyashi in the name of a spiritual university in many states of the country including the capital Delhi, has been missing since the demolition
 court ne dhongi baba ke vakil or sibiai ko virendra dev ko pesh karne kaa aadesh diya hua he, lekin baba he ki kisi ko mil hi nahin rahaa
 Surrounded by allegations of raping and physically abusing women and girls in the name of imparting spiritual education in many cities of the country, this imposter Baba has become a search for the country's largest investigative agency CBI
 adaalat ke farmaan ke baad sibiai ne virendra dev kii talash to shuru kii, lekin ab tak sibiai ke haath jo laga he use jaan aap bhi sann rah jaaenge
 The CBI recorded cdrs and statements of thousands of people associated with him in search of Baba
 lekin ab tak vah mahaj is nattejey par pahunch saki he kivirendra dev aakiri baar22 april, 2015 ko dekha gaya tha
 Baba's last location was Farrukhabad, when he met his sister
 dilli hai court ab tak virendra dev ko pesh karne ke kai aadesh de chuki he, iske baavjood sibiai baba ko khoj kar adaalat ke saamne pesh karne main abtak naakaam rahi he
 The biggest reason for this is that nobody has seen Baba in the last few years
 baba ko khoj nikaalane ke liye sibiai kii kai timen desh ke har us mumkin jagah par gayi jahaan baba se jude kuch suraag mil sakate the
 But as if Baba has taken samadhi to such a place that it has not been impossible to find it
 lekin yah gumshudagi kai sawaal khadey kar rahi he
 The first question is that when Baba has been missing since 2015, why was a case registered against him three years after that? The second important question is when Baba was missing, why did not any person from the Ashram and his devotees take the trouble to search for him? And the third question arises as to who was operating so many ashrams in the absence of Baba? The CBI also inquired around these questions from the people associated with the ashram and Baba, but despite this nothing seemed to happen
 sibiai neyon shoshan or apharan ke teen maamlebaba ke kilaaf darj kiye hai
 It is alleged that in the Ayyashi ashrams run in the name of the university, girls were forcibly held hostage and Baba sexually abused them

 Dantewada district Superintendent of Police Narendra Khare said today that Badridutt Pandey, a sub-inspector of 195 Battalion of Central Reserve Police Force, allegedly committed suicide by shooting his service rifle at the CRPF camp at Barsur in the district today

 The incident took place on a day when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh apparently raised questions on Hazare's proposed hunger strike on the Lokpal Bill in the name of the nation after hoisting the tricolor on the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day and said that the opponents of the bill Are, they should not go on fast unto death

 Manish Sisodia, a close aide of Hazare, said that he gave the affidavit to the police, accepting 16 of the 22 conditions

 In the affidavit submitted to the Delhi Police, the Hazare side accepted the remaining 16 conditions, excluding six

 On the other hand, Arvind Kejriwal alleged that he was forced to seek permission from the corrupt people

 It is against the will of the people to impose a bill on them

 The 72nd anniversary of the country's independence was also celebrated in the village of Chamoli district, which contributed to the country's freedom struggle from the Battle of Kargil
 chamoli jile main pahaado kii god main based chote se gaanv sawad main aaj tak pahunchaa jahaan baari barish or kharaab mausam kii parvaah kiye bina tirangaa fahraaya gaya
 School children shouted patriotic slogans along with the band in scout dress and chanted country songs carrying the tricolor

 Every family in this village has given special sacrifices for different wars of the country
 is gaanv ke har ghar ne faujee diya he jisane alag-alag yuddh main hissaa liya
 The tricolor was hoisted at the memorial built in the village in memory of the martyrs and soldiers
 baari barsaat bhi in seva nrivitt javaanon ko tirangaa fahraane se roak nahin pai
 The sons of the village of Sawad fought for freedom, were also part of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's Azad Hind Fauj, while sacrificing in the First and Second World Wars
 is gaanv ke beton ne 1965 or 1971 kii jang main bhi dushmano ko dhul chataayee
 From the freedom fight to the Kargil war, the soldiers of this village are now fighting a new battle, not against any enemy but with the government
 ye jang do dashak puraani he or kaagajon ke jariye ladi ja rahi he
 This fight is for road, school and a hospital
 gaanv ke uppradhan virendra singh kaa kahana he ki unhone sadak ke liye bahut guhaar lagaai lekin unki guhaar kisi ne nahin suni
 There is also a military in this village who cut off the hands of Pakistanis in the battle of 71, but now when the hands become old, the government does not listen to them
 saraad gaanv ke faujee apane gaanv ke liye 10 kilometre lambii behatar sadak, ek kendriya vidhyalay or praathmik ilaaj ke liye chote se aspataal kii maang kar rahe hai
 The Deputy Principal told Aaj Tak that the 10 km long road was built 25 years ago but it is not repaired
 sadak puri tarah se tuuti hui he or is par aana-janaa jokhim bharaa he
 Troopers say that two and a half decades have passed since their wait, but the road once built was never repaired
 pahari par based is gaanv tak pahunchane ke liye 10 kilometre kaa lanbaa safar narak yatnaa jaisaa he
 In rainy, broken roads have turned into a moat
 phogiyon kaa kahana he ki sadak naa hone se gaanv ke chote-chote bacchon kii jindagi khatre main pad gai he
 These soldiers pleaded before many Chief Ministers of Uttarakhand, petitioned in government offices but did not hear
 sarkari skool he lekin behatar padhai ke liye wo gaanv main ek kendriya vidhyalay chaahate hai jisaki maang soobe kii sarkaar ko kai baar bheji ja chuki he
 On the problem of army personnel of this village, we asked ML Bhetwal, the Tehsildar of the area, then the Tehsildar Saheb clarified that he has knowledge of the problem but the challenge of dealing with the devastation caused by the cloudburst at other places in the area is much bigger at present, after which He will definitely pay attention to the demand of this village
 tehseeldaar sahabaka kahana he ki gaanv main aspataal or kendriya vidhyalay kii maang ke bare main soobe ke mukhyamantri ko bhi bataaya gaya he lekin karrwai abhi tak nahin ho pai
 Even after 71 years of independence, this village does not have the basic facilities
 aazaadee kii 72veen saalagirah par yah faujee desh kii sarkaar se guhaar laga rahe hai ki unke gaanv ko sadak skool or ek aspataal kaa tohfa mili
 Before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the Election Commission may issue new guidelines on broadcasting of exit polls and opinion polls

 Significantly, the commission had a few years ago banned the transmission and publication of exit polls until the end of the final phase of the election
 iske baad media sanghathanon ne ucchtam nyaayalay kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha or aadesh ko waapas kara liya tha
 The Election Commission had asked the court to decide on whether the publication and broadcast of exit polls and public opinion polls for a particular period during the election process should be stayed

 This is Donald Trump's first overseas trip since becoming US President
 america media kaa kahana he ki america raashtrapati chunaav main rus ke dakhal kii jaanch kar rahe FBI pramukh james komi ko hataane orrus ke videsh mantri sargei lavarove ko ahm khufia jaankaree dene ke chalate vivaadon main funsane ke baad trump jaan bachaakar videsh ravaanaa hue hai
 The US President will visit Saudi Arabia, Israel, Italy and Belgium on his first foreign tour
 ab sawaal yah uth rahe hai ki america kii satta sanbhaalane se lekar ab tak vivaadon main rahane vaale trump kya apni pehali videsh yatra ko safal bana paaenge? dilachasp baat yah he ki donald trump apane pehle videshi daure kii shuruyaat muslim desh se kar rahe hai
 He will first reach Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, where he will address leaders of 50 Muslim countries of the world
 white house kaa kahana he ki riyaad main donald trump islamic deshon ko islam par pravachan sunaayenge
 Also read: With this announcement of Trump, the 50 Islamic countries of the world, from the possibility of riot American presidential elections and positions, now there is a tough challenge to prove their foreign trip successful in front of the Trump who spewed continuously poison against Muslims
 trump kaa hameshaa se vivaadon se naata rahaa he
 CNN says Trump has opted to go abroad to avoid questions of controversy
 aam taur america raashtrapati apane pehle videshi daure ke liye canada yaa mexico jaise padosi deshon kaa chunaav karte hai, lekin trump ne isse hatakar yah faisla liya he
 Sky News says that Trump thinks that if he goes on a trip abroad, the disputes will end until he returns
 lekin aisa hone vaala nahin he, unako sawaalon ke jawaab dene hi honge
 Recently, Trump had laughably said that he has not been treated like any other president till date
 trump ne america na sirf FBI pramukh komi ko hataaya, balki rus se sambandh maamle kii jaanch ke liye vishesh counsal niyukt kiya he
 Apart from this, the question regarding Trump's foreign tour is also important that Trump has no diplomatic experience

 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 ab jab ashok lavasa samiti ne apni report sarkaar ko saunp di he or jald hi vittamantri arun jetali is report par koi antim faisla sarkaar kii ore se le lenge
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that in its report, the Pay Commission had initially fixed the HRA at 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months but till now more than seven months have passed and so far no committee has submitted its report
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 Now that the Ashok Lavasa committee has submitted its report to the government and soon Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will take a final decision on this report from the government
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak saat maheene se zyada samay biit chukaa he or abhi tak kisi bhi samiti ne apni report nahin saunpi he

 An IT professional working in an MNC booked an Uber cab
 cab main uske saath driver ne chhedhkhani shuru kar di
 The girl alleges that she did not get any special help from Uber, police also took six hours to file a case
 shalini (badla hua naam) he ke jariye ham aapako unke saath hui daraavnee ghatana ke bare main bataate hai
 Shalini works as an IT professional in an MNC in Gurugram
 shanivaar ko ve kisi kaam se dilli ke dwarka sector 12 gayi
 He booked an Uber cab to return home at 8
17 pm
 cab main baithte hi driver unase chhedhkhani karne laga
 Shalini said that '3-4 minutes after taking the taxi, the driver said that there is less air in the rear tire, you sit in front
 to main aage aakar baith gai
 Meanwhile, the driver was talking to someone with profanity
 iske baad driver ne apana haath meri thai main tach kiya
 i thought it must have happened by mistake the first time
 lekin baad main wo baar-baar tach karne laga
 There was darkness and solitude, i did not understand what to do
 'shalini ke mutabik vah driver kii harkaton se itnaa dar gayi thi ki 100 number par kol karne kii himmat nahin kar pain
 When he messaged the Uber app and asked for help, the driver threatened to kill him
 shalini ke mutabik ubar kii taraf se unhen koi khaas madad nahin mili
 Shalini said that after a while the Uber people called the driver and said, 'end the trip and take the customer off here
 jabaki maine unako bataaya tha ki aria sunsaan he or mujhe is aria kii jaankaree nahin he
 i thought they would help me, they would call the police or do something else
 lekin unhone ek tarah se driver kii hi help kar di or mujhe vahiin utaar diya
 After that nothing means whether i reached home safely or not, whether i got a cab or not
 'shalini ke mutabik cab se utaarne ke baad driver ne kuch duuri tak unka peechha bhi kiya or phir chalaa gaya
 Shalini took another cab and reached home somehow
 iske baad ve himmat karke saat may ko dwarka north thane main cese darj karaane pahunchin to police ne 6 ghante baad aaropee driver irfan ke khilaaf cese darj kiya
 In this case, Uber spokeswoman Disha Luthra said in her statement that 'whatever happened is not acceptable under any circumstances and there is no place in the app for this

 After the news of the people being forced to cross the river by sitting on a tube due to not having a culvert on the Bhainsawat river in Machhet village of Karauli, the National Human Rights Commission has given notice to the state government and sought its reply
 vahiin jila prashasan bhi harakat main aayaa
 The administration, in collaboration with the Panchayat Samiti, started the work of constructing a road 200 feet long and eight feet wide in the river
 kaam teji se chal rahaa hai jo do teen din main puraa hone kii ummid he
 District Collector Manoj Sharma has instructed the SDM and Patwari to be sent to the spot and find out the situation
 unhone bataaya ki logon ko nadi paar na kerani pade iske liye prabandh karavaaenge
 Instructions have been given to the Public Works Department to prepare a proposal for construction of the culvert on the river and tender it
 unhone bataaya ki panchayat samiti ko nirdesh dekar schuli bacchon ke liye gaanv se skool tak vaahan kii vyavastha karne ke bhi nirdesh die hai
 They have to cross the river
 They said that it is also unsafe to cross the river by driving a boat in the river
 isliye samasya ke sthai samaadhaan ke liye sheeghra puliya kaa nirmaan karaayaa jayega
 Around 70 children of the village of Matchet have to cross the Bhainsawat river to ride to the school and the villagers ride on a tube for necessary work
 jisamen kai baar haadase bhi ho jate hai
 Apart from this, sick and pregnant women also have to cross the river from tube to hospital
 kai baar shikaayat va maang karne par bhi sarkaar va prashasan ne puliya nirmaan kaa kaary nahin karaayaa
 When Aaj Tak showed the news, now the proceedings have started
 sadak nirmaan teji se chal rahaa he
 The government claims to spend crores in the name of news education shown on September 21, but there is a small village at Karauli district headquarters from where parents risk their children's lives and send children to read
 karauli se 20 kimi dur sthit machet gaanv he jahaan chaaron ore pahadiyaan he barsaat ke samay bhainsavatandi main paniane se gramin apane bacchon ko nadi tub ke sahare paar karakar 10 se 15 kimi kii duuri par paidal hi skool bhejte hai
 There is a primary school in the village, so the villagers are forced to risk their children's lives and cross the river with the help of a tube every day and send them to Government Higher Secondary School Chainpur, Kaundar
 lagbhag 200 meter lambi nadi main bachche pratidin subah-shaam skool aane-jane ke liye tub ko nadi main chalaate hai
 The water in the river is close to 15 feet
 gaanv ke vidhyalay shikshak siyaaraam kaa kahana he ki nadi kii lambaai 150 se 200 meter va gaharaai 15 feet he jise pratidin schuli vidhyaarthiyon ke alaava tub ke sahare prasuti mahila va marijon ko nadi paar kerani padati he
 In which there is always danger
 kai baar graminon ne prashasan se shikaayat kii he lekin abhi tak koi sunwaayee nahin hui he
 We request you to build a bridge over the river
 12veen kii chaatra anitha kahati he ki nadi kaa pani bahut gaharaa he
 Everyday we have to cross the river with the help of a tube
 jisase skool jane main der ho jaati he
 Our studies are missed
 chaatra ne adhikariyon se guhaar lagaai ki hamaari samasya ko dur karne ke liye nadi par pul banwaaya jaae

 Bollywood actor Rajkumar Rao's film 'shaadi Mein Sure Aana' was shown at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Saturday evening
 is film main rajkumaar raav or kriti kharbanda lead role main najar aae the
 The producer of the film, Vinod Bachchan, said that he got a call from the President's office and we were told that the ministry wants to see the film, as they have heard good things about it
 rielity sho ke dauraan rajkumaar raav kaa pair hua fracturevinod ne film ko lekar kaha, "main is baat ko sun kar kaaphi khush ho gaya or isliye, hamane is film ko raashtrapati bhawan main prasaarit kiya
 The film will be aired in other ministries on Sunday
 yah ek chote kasbe kii paariwarik film he
 "he said," This film depicts the journey and struggle of the life of an IPS officer
 isse sabhi mantri swayan ko jodakar dekh sakate hai
 "when Rajkummar Rao had to go through the dark box office because of the dark appearance of films, 'shaadi Mein Zar Mein Aana', 'bareilly Ki Barfi' and 'shubh Mangal Savdhan' are gaining immense popularity
 vinod kaa maananaa he ki log khud ko in filmon ke kirdaaron se jod paa rahe hai or yahi kaaran he ki ise log pasand kar rahe hai
 Vinod said that truth be told, the best business in the era of mobile phones is that these films are able to do stories based on small towns, because the audience is watching them in theaters instead of watching them in mobile phones
 'shaadi main jarur aana' is saal 10 navambar ko cinemagharon main relies hui thi or yah chote kasbon ke single screen theatreon main ab bhi prasaarit ho rahi he
 Do you have enough network on your mobile phone? Do you get full data speed? Have you started giving call drop damages to mobile companies? If your answer is in "no", which obviously will be, then we are more responsible than ourselves for this
 darasal, ham bhartiya ek ajeeb kism ke vismaran ke shikaar hai
 We often forget the headlines that we should have in our mind because doing so is essential to our interests as citizens and consumers
 jab ham hi unhen bhul jate hai to sarkaar ke liye inhen bhulaanaa or bhi suvidhajanak ho jaataa he
 Instead, in politics, she catches us in debate like Bharat Mata ki Jai, which does not take us anywhere
 aisi hi ek surkhi bani thi pichley saal agast main jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne telecom kshetra kii samiksha baithak ke dauraan kol drop par gahari naaraazgi jataate hue ise “argently” thik karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The statement issued from the PMO said that the call drop problem on the voice network should not go to the data network
 ham is surkhi ko bhul gaye or twitor, fasebuk par or tivi studio main beja bahason main ulajh gaye
 We did not back down and ask for the status of this order
 kol drop kii samasya kamjor data network tak fail chuki he jahaan 3ji ke naam par 2ji kii speed bhi mushkil he
 According to a network survey in March, call drop in India increased to 4
 73 fisadi par pahunch rahe hai jo tiri ke maanak do fisadi or global maanak teen fisadi se bhi ooncha he
 Meanwhile, mobile companies, refusing to obey the rule to return money to consumers on poor service, took the case to the Supreme Court, where the TRAI, famous for weak lobbying and peculiar orders, courted legal and technical contradictions over the entire case
 Is listening to the rebuke yah penalty amal main aane kii sambhaavna philhal kam hi he
 In the same column last year, we had written that a bad mobile network is not such a big problem for the government that is launching huge global campaigns like Make in India, Digital India, which has to be agreed in Parliament to handle it
 kharaab network ko thik karne ke liye prashasnic, takneekee or kanoonee, teenon kshetron se pahal jaruri thi jo abhi tak najar nahin ai or is bich operataron ne maamle ko adaalat main fansaa diya
 The biggest drawback in resolving call drop solutions is the strictness of operators
 2014 main spectrum nilaamee ko apni sabase badi safalataa bataate hue sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki doorsanchaar kshetra ab chalaange lagayegaa, kyonki companiyon ko paryaapt spectrum mil gaya he
 Companies can divide spectrum among themselves and place other companies on their towers
 paryaapt spectrum ke baavjood agar kol drop bad rahe hai to uski vajah yah he ki companiyon ne network main nivesh nahin kiya he
 Voice network usage increased by 12 per cent between January 2013 and March 2015, but network (BTS) capacity increased by only 8 per cent
 tiri ke mutabik, pichley do saal main 3ji par data network kaa istemaal 252 fisadi badha lekin companiyon ne network main keval 61 fisadi kii badhotaree kii
 If the government wishes, it can set rules to create a true balance between the network and the number of consumers
 taaki companiyaan sirf graahak jutaney kii hode main hi na lagi rahen balki network main paryaapt nivesh ke liye bhi baadhya hon
 TRAI itself believes that the reduction in towers is the major reason for the call drop
 mobile companiyon ke mutabik, network ko behatar karne or kol drop rokane ke liye philhal ek lakh toweron kii jarurat he
 Most of the towers in it are needed in metros
 agar sarkaar gambhir hoti to rajyon ke sahyog se chote-chote toweron ke liye kuch gaj jameen yaa chhaten bhi jutaney kaa kaam mahaj ek prashasnic aadesh se ho saktaa tha
 Along with this, new technical efforts of call drop solutions are also needed
 bazaar main aisi takneekein uplabdh hai jo imaaraton ke bheetar mobile exange jaisi pranaliyaan taiyaar kar sakati hai jo band parisaron main spectrum kii kamajori kaa vikalp hai
 Telecom networks in other cities of the world strike a balance between landlines and mobiles to limit spectrum consumption
 sarkaar ko landline kii vaapasi or antarparisar sanchaar ke liye nai takneekon kii pahal kerani chahie jo mobile network par dabaav kam karne ke liye anivaary he
 Strong legal interdiction was necessary to tighten the operators into punitive provisions
 duuranchaar kshetra main niamak va operataron ke bich adalati ladaai kaa lanbaa itihaas taakid karata he ki aksar niamak apni kamjor taiyaariyon ke kaaran haar jaataa he
 The Supreme Court has put TRAI in the dock over the order of penalty on call drop
 tiri ne kol drop ke liye penalty dene kaa niyam bana diya to duusari taraf beete november main apane ek shodh patr main yah bhi kah diya ki kharaab network ke liye spectrum kii kami va toweron kii killat jaise takneekee kaaran bhi jimmedaar hai
 Operators are now using this logic to fix service and avoid paying penalties for poor service
 network kanjeshan bharat ke digital hone kii raah main sabase badi samasya hone vaala he lekin pradhanmantri ke dakhal ke baavjood, sarkaar, kol drop khatm karne kii ladaai labhag haar chuki he
 The Ministry of Communications is completely at the mercy of mobile operators, who have always won in court battles
 sarkaar ko haar isliye mili kyonki is samasya ko sanbhaalane main apekshit saahas or gambhirtha najar nahin ai
 Today, we do not have good service, nor is there a system to compensate us for the loss
 ham bazaar or sarkaar, donon ke haathon thage gaye hai

 (input language) taiwan kii company Asus kaa ek smartphone he jise kuch maheene hi pehle bharat main launch kiya gaya he
 The name of this smartphone is Zenfone AR
 yah aam hai and smartphone nahin he, balki yah ogmented reality besd (AR) smartphone he or isi vajah se isamen kai khaasiyaten jud gai hai or yah customers ko ek alag anubhav dene kaa daawa karata he
 Let us know in the review of this smartphone how much it meets the claims of the company and whether you should buy the smartphone or not
 hamo is rivyuu main khaastaur par yah bhi bataaenge ki agar is smartphone or google virtual reality hedset dadrem kaa istemaal karte hue aapako virtual world main janaa he to aapke liye kaise anubhav hoga
 We have used it quite a lot with Google Daydream
 yah pehla smartphone he jisamen google tango project saport diya gaya he
 Not only this, virtual reality has also been supported
 dizin or bild qualitypenthone AR solid bild quality vaala smartphone he or camera modul aakarshak lagata he or yah ise dusron se alag karata he
 The home button itself has a fingerprint scanner and its body is the same as Phab 2 Pro
 rier panel ledar finnish kaa he jisase hold karnaa kaaphi aasaan he or grip acchhee rahati he
 The bottom of the phone has a USB Type c port
 zenfone AR kii body aisi he ki isame scrtch pataa nahin chalata jo acchhee baat he
 Overall, this smartphone looks different from the other devices in this segment in terms of design and build quality, and for that it has a leather design and intricate camera module on the metal surface
 displexendone AR main 5
 The 7-inch WQHD display is given, the panel is super amoled and the special thing is that its display is not much saturated
 Galaxy S8 se isaki disple behatar nahin he, lekin color achche lagate hai
 In the light of the sun, you can easily read the contents of its screen
 chunki yah smartphone virtual reality besd he or artificial intelligence ke liye banaaya gaya he, isliye isaki screen kaa asli majaa aapako VR hedset main milegaa
 In this review, we will further explain how this smartphone works with Google's virtual reality headset
 parformansthasus zenfone AR hai and smartphone he or isamen qolkom snapadragon 821 procesar diya gaya he
 Although it is a year old processor, but it is stable
 ek vairient main 8GB ram ke saath 128GB kii internal memory di gai he
 This smartphone does not lag and does not hang
 ek ap se duusare ap main janaa aasaan he
 There will be no lag that many high end gaming can do
 isaki khaasiyat ye he ki aap virtual reality games install karke hedset lagaakar gaming kar sakate hai aapako ek alag anubhav milegaa
 However, if you are running for half an hour in a VR headset, then this smartphone heats up
 kul milakar yah achche parformens vaala smartphone he or isamen diya gaya yujar interphes company kaa custom he, isliye shaayad aapako pasand na aae
 Personally, this user interface is a bit annoying
 camerathasus zenfone AR main 23 megapixl kaa rier camera diya gaya he jiskaa aparchar f / 2
 Is 0
 iske saath hi isamen 4-axis optical image stebligeshan or electronic image stebligeshan diya gaya he
 We have used this smartphone, one thing is clear, the camera module given in it is powerful, it clicks good pictures
 color riproduction badhiya he or isamen die gaye tango aire kii vajah se photo clic karne ke baad aap photo ke becoground or forground focus ko manage kar sakate hai
 If you are good light or you are doing outdoor photography, then with your professional skill you can click the image like DSLR
 photose main acchhee diteling dekhne ko milegi, lekin kam raushnee main hamen iske camere ne thodaa niraash kiya he
 By Vikas Kumar, the virtual reality review of zenfone AR, i am assuming that you have seen 360 degree photos / videos
 agar nahin dekha he to dekh lijie
 Do a search by writing 360 degree photos / videos on youtube
 pichley kuch samay se is fichar ne badi tezi se apni pahunch duniyabar main banaai he
 Actually due to this feature, the video / photo viewer starts to feel like being present at that place
 wo keval darshak nahin rahata
 He is not just watching the video or photo, he is feeling that video photo
 is ahsaas ko aapane tab-tab fil kiya hoga jab aapane 60 degree photo / video ko apane laptop / commuter par mouse kii madad se yaa mobile par apni oongali se ghuma-ghumaakar dekha hoga lekin ab isse aage kii chiz aa chuki he
 And this is the thing that will change the way 60 degree photos / videos are viewed and its feeling or say it is changing
 jis tareeqe se 60 degree photo / video soshaal media par logon ke bich lokapriy hua usee tezi se yah nayaa divaais bhi logon ke bich lokapriy ho rahaa he
 So, let me introduce you to this toy (device) and try to tell you our experience
 is divaais ko VR Headset (viaar hedset) kehete hai
 VR means virtual reality, and virtual reality means a reality that is not real but is
 is sachai ko aap mahasoos kar sakate hai
 So when you wear this headset and watch a 60 degree photo / video with it, you feel that you have reached this environment where the video is
 aap apane aapako us halaat ke bich khud ko pate hai
 Last week i used one such VR headset and with its help, i saw many 60 degree photos / videos
 google ke is hedset ke saath aapako ek remote jaisi chiz bhi milti he jisaki madad se aap hedset pahane-pahane hi video aage-peeche kar lete hai
 Let's play a new video
 is hedset se pehle jo viaar hedset ke saath aisa koi controlar nahin miltaa tha jisase thodi pareshaani hoti he kyonki agar aapane ek video dekh liya he to duusare ke liye aapako hedset se mobile nikaalkar doosraa video lagaana hota tha jo ki bahut hi jhelau kaam he
 But with the help of this headset and VR app from Google, watching 60 degree photos / videos gives a different experience
 maine ek baar hedset lagaaya to agle do ghante tak ek ke baad ek 60 degree video dekhtaa gaya
 With the Google headset, i used an Asus phone with a VR app preloaded
 in sab kaa anubhav aapako zenfone AR ke saath behtareen milegaa
 This app does not run on all smartphones
 agar anubhav kii baat karuun to wo shandaar tha
 i saw the story of a village near the Himalayas and while looking at it, it seemed that i was not in my room in Munirka, but in between them
 agar aapane kabhi apane bachapan main biscope dekhi hogi to aap ise bilkul vaisaa hi samajhie
 Only he used to walk in it and it plays photos as well as videos
 aap sun bhi sakate hai
 But the way of seeing is almost the same
 maine yah anubhav kiya ki dekhne ke dauraan phone bahut garam ho jaataa he
 For watching 60 degree photos / videos, you also need internet speed
 agar internet kaa speed thik nahin he or phul echdi main nahin dekh paa rahe hai to aap us manzar ko achche se mahasoos nahin kar paayenge
 So if you want to try it, take care of it
 duusari baat, maine yah bhi fil kiya ki is madhyam se achche video kii kami abhi bhi he
 Most of the videos or good videos are in English but i believe that as the medium spreads, the lack of content will be removed
 kul milakar main yah kahana chahta hoon ki google ke viaar hedset, controlar or viaar ap kii madad se 60 degree photo / video dekhne kaa meraa apana anubhav shandaar rahaa or main is fichar / divaais ko krantikari maanata hoon jo aane vaale vaqt main hamaare-aapke video dekhne kaa tareeqa badalakar rakh degaa
 This is possible with the Asus zenfone AR
 If you have come here while studying, it clearly means that you are interested, sir, try it once and then share how your experience was

 4 navambar ko shuukravaar or shanivaar kii darmiyaani raat somnath ko naksaliyon ne maut kii ghat utaar diya tha
 The situation in the area remained normal till Somnath's funeral on Sunday
 lekin somvaar kii shaam hote hote somnath kii maut ke maamle ne tool pakad liya
 In the FIR registered for the murder, apart from the noted Naxalivinod, JNU professor Archana Prasad and Delhi University professor Nandani Sundar were also named in the conspiracy to murder
 iske baad raipur se lekar dilli tak halchal much gai
 However, the police neither made public a copy of the FIR nor officially revealed the names of the accused involved in the murder
 itani gopneeyata kyon barti gai yah to bastar police jane
 But the case took a new turn when Professor Nandani Sundar in Delhi accused IGP SRP Kalluri of Bastar Range of redressing enmity
 jeenyu or diu kaa naksali conectiondilli ke nami giraami kuch ek prophessoron kii bastar main niyamit awajahi he
 Professors claim that they come here for research
 lekin ye kabhi bataate kii research or theory kaa byora wo kanha saupate he
 They do not even tell whether the research is within a fellowship or that University has authorized them for related research
 bastar main maanav adhikaron ke ulanghan ke maamle profesar jor shor se uthaate he, bastar se lekar raipur or dilli tak
 Even in the courts, the Chhattisgarh Police and the Government have been surrounded by the professors accused of harassment cases many times
 haal hi main supreme court ne tarmetala main adivaasiyon ke ghar jalaaye jane ke maamle ke sunwaayee ke dauraan chhattisgarh police ko aade hatho liya
 This is not the only case in which the state government had to listen to the poor, in many such cases even before this, many of their companions including Nandni Sundar and Archana Prasad have increased the police trouble
 udhar police kii daleel he ki jeenyu or diu kaa ek dhada desh main naksalwad ke paalan poshan kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 These people defame the police and the government by accusing them of human rights violations and fake encounters
 police kii yah bhi daleel he ki naksali police karmiyon ke alaava saikado nirdosh graminon ko kabhi goli maarthe he to kabhi chaakuon or talavaaron se unki nirmam hatya kar dete he
 During this time, this professor maintains silence regarding the human rights of the victims
 yahi nahin schuli baccho ko naksali paath padhaane, schuli imaaraten todane, vikaas kaary thap karne or hinsa or aagjanee ke ghatnao ko anjaam dene ke kisi bhi maamle main aaropee naksaliyon kii giraftaar ko lekar yachika in prophessoron ne kabhi bhi adaalat main daayar nahin kii

 He alleges that he has exposed several incidents of fake encounters in Bastar and gang rape with tribals
 iske chalate aiji kalluri kii jamkar fajiyat bhi hui he
 When the police did not find any cases against him, the IG dragged his name in the FIR to forget the enmity
 udhar bastar range ke aiji es aar pi kalluri ne in aaropo ko bebuniyaad bataaya he
 According to him, after the statements of the deceased's wife and a few witnesses, the names of the accused of killing Somnath were registered in the FIR
 unke mutabik agar kisi ko koi aapatti he to wo jaanch adhikari ke saamne apni baat rakh saktaa he or duusare kanoonee vikalp uske saamne he
 After all, in the initial phase of Tangia Group Bastar, the movement against the Naxalites called Salwa Judum was waged by the tribals
 is dauraan un par naksaliyon ke hamale tej ho gaye
 The police gave guns to some people associated with this movement for self-defense
 is dauraan hathiyaaron ke darupyog or salwa judum main shaamil logo ko avaidh sangrakshan jaise aarope police par lage
 The case for providing arms to agitators was awarded in court
 varsh 2010 ke dashak main supreme court ne salwa judum bhang karne ke nirdesh police ko die
 Weapons were also recovered from the villagers
 iske baad bastar main koi bhi sangathit andolan naksaliyon ke khilaaf astitv main nahin aayaa, haalanki janajagriti or naksaliyon ko khadedane ke naam par kuch ek sanghathan jarur bane lekin wo bhi kargar nahin rahe
 Somnath formed the Tangia Group in Kumkoling village of Sukma in the month of May to June this year, with the aim of expelling the Naxalites from their village
 graminon kaa tark tha ki naksali unhen bemaut maar rahe he
 Not only this, the development work came to a standstill due to the presence of Naxalites in their area
 chand dinon main naksaliyon ke khilaaf log ekajute hone lage or tangiya group main shaamil hone vaale adivaasiyon kii sankhya din guni raat chauguni pragati karti rahi
 Naxalites were banned in many villages and the entry into the village almost stopped
 naksali somnath ke khun ke pyaase ho gaye
 Actually, Tangia is the traditional weapon of the tribals
 iske jariye wo naa keval lakadiya kaantate he balki tangiya aatm raksha ke liye bhi rakhte he
 Usually during the movement in the forest, the tangia is seen hanging on the shoulder of the tribals
 tangiya group ke kai sadasyo ne tir kaman bhi thama tha
 It is also a traditional weapon of tribals
 donon hi hathiyaaron ko dhaaran karne ke liye shastr license kii zarurat nahin padati
