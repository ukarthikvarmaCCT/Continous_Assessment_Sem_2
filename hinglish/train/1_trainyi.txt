 Many eminent journalists and people strongly opposed the bbc's decision to discontinue the Hindi service to reduce spending
 yah seva 31 march ko band honi thi lekin use ek saal ke liye badha diya gaya he
 The BBC World Service has said that it was suggested by several business parties to alternate funding for the service
 lekin agar koi vikalp nahin mila to yah seva march 2012 main band kar di jaayegi
 The campaign was supported by Arundhati Roy, Vikram Seth and Mark Tully
 in logon ne kaha tha ki bibisi hindi seva ke ek karod shrota hai jisamen adhiktar gramin ilaakon se taalluk rakhte hai
 The BBC World Service was started in the year 1940 and gained tremendous popularity when the media was under government control in India

 ginati ke sansthaanon ko chhod den to bharat ke vishvavidhyalay main kya haal he ham aapako uniwarsity series main samay-samay par dikhaate hi rahete hai
 The new incident is that students in Manipur University have started a movement against Vice Chancellor Adya Prasad Pandey
 40 dinon se vahaan padhai thapp he or chaatro ke samarthan main kareeb 28 vibhaagon ke adhyaksh ne apane pad se istipha de diya he
 5 deans of different academic schools have also recommended
 is hadtaal ke kaaran vahi hai jo bharat ke anek uniwarsity main maujuud hai
 From May 30, the demands on which these students are on strike are in every university
 in chaatro ne pehle apni maang kaa charter bhi diya tha
 When the hearing did not take place, he sat on the protest
 chaatro kaa jor is baat par he academik calendar behatar ho or shikshakon ke khaali pad bhare jaaen taaki chaatro ko shikshak mil sake
 The student union president m Dayaman said that there are 115 vacancies in the university
 isamen 25 professor hai, 51 associat professor hai or 39 assistant professor hai
 If there are so many vacancies, then understand what the study would be like
 bhugol vibhaag main hi 8 shikshak hone chahie magar teen hin hai or wo bhi teenon assitant professor hai
 Due to the absence of five-five teachers, students of geography are suffering greatly
 shikshakon kii bahaali ke liye 2016 main vigyaapan niklaa magar bahaali nahin hui
 The advertisement ran out again in 2017 and was not reinstated
 zarurat hamen teaching staff kii he magar non teaching staff ke padon par logon ko theke par rakhaa ja rahaa he or inamen se zyaadaatar vaais chancelar kii pasand ke hai
 Temporary people have been placed in the posts of Controller of Examinations, Registrars and Librarians, which has slowed down the decision making process
 kyonki har chiz vaais chancelar tay karte hai
 The president of the student union alleges that the Vice Chancellor stays on the university campus for ten days in a month
 iske kaaran filein der tak ataki rahati hai
 It has been a year and a half since the New Year, there is a fair amount of peace in Manipur, yet academic activity has not picked up
 shanti ke halaat main academik calendar behatar ho saktaa tha
 Exams are not being held on time and the results are delayed
 original certificate nikaalane main 30 se 45 din lag jate hai jabaki pehle 2 se 5 din hi lagate the
 The staff union also joined the strike of the students union and now the teachers union has also come along
 ab baat is jagah pahunch gai he ki chaatro or shikshak sangh kaa kahana he ki jab tak vaais chancelar adya prasad pandey ko hataaya nahin jayega, is hadtaal kaa koi samaadhaan nahin hoga
 This strike, which has been going on for forty days, was noticed today because on Sunday the teachers have resigned from the post of president of all departments
 manipur medical science ke dean ko chhod kar paanch dean ne istipha de diya
 The Vice Chancellor is describing the students as extremist supporters
 unka kahana he ki unhen hataane ke liye dean or vibhaagon ke adhyaksh par dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he
 While teachers say that a high level committee should investigate all the allegations against the Vice Chancellor
 shikshakon ke sangh muta ne pradhanmantri, chif rector or maanav sansaadhan mantri or mukhyamantri se dakhal dene kii apil kii he
 The teachers have also given one day salary to run the mess in the hostel because all the work has come to a standstill due to this strike
 chaatro ne sabhi vibhaagon main taala laga diya he
 The Chief Minister of Manipur has also called and spoken to the President of Teachers Association
 ravivaar ko chaatro or shikshakon ne aarope lagaaya he ki uniwarsity campus main bahari tatwon ko bulaayaa gaya he taaki avyavashtha failaai ja sake
 Now that the time for talks is gone, the only solution is to have the Vice Chancellor removed
 adya prasad pandey oktober 2016 main vaais chancelar bane the
 Adya Prasad Pandey has been a student of Banaras Hindu University
 1979 se biechayu main padhaa rahe hai
 He was the chairman of bhu's economics department before becoming a VC of Manipur University
 kya aap jaanate hai ki desh kii 80 pratishat shiksha collejon main hoti he or unki haalat bahut karaab he
 90 percent of higher education is done in state universities whose condition is worse
 in par kya dhyaan diya ja rahaa he, kuch pataa nahin he
 i am mentioning this because on 9 July i
e
 today, the Minister of Human Resources has announced the Institute of Eminence
 prakaash jaavdekar ne twit kiya he ki ye landmark inishiative he yani mile kaa pathar sabit hone vaala kadam he
 He has tweeted because a panel of government experts has selected the institute of Eminence
 aaj ham 6 vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi jari kar rahe hai
 3 are government and 3 are private
 instituteofeminence desh ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 We have 800 universities but not a single university is in the top 100 or 200 in the world
 aaj ke faisle se hamen ye hasil karne main madad milegi
 There are no 115 teachers in Manipur University, not many colleges and universities like him, but India feels that the first task is to reach the top 100 or 200
 acha he, ye zid honi chahie magar ye dhun bhi honi chahie ki 95 fisadi chaatro ke liye uniwarsity or college hai wo kam se kam padhane or padhaane laayak ho saken
 It is not right to rely too much on ranking
 kahin isaki haalat tiarapy jaisi na ho jaae
 Prakash Javadekar gave a statement during Question Hour in Lok Sabha on 20 March 2017 that within a year, 9000 teachers will be appointed in Delhi University
 ek saal biit gaya
 This is the situation here in Delhi
 classroom main shikshakon ko niyukt karnaa bhi landmark disijan hona chahie magar ranking kii zid kaa aakarshan shaayad badi khabar he
 The six universities selected are IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore
 in teen sansthaanon ke naam pehle bhi duniya kii ranking main aate rahe hai
 The Indian Institute of Science ranks between 251 and 300 in the Times Higher Education rankings
 iaiti dilli or bombai kaa sthaan 500 se 600 main he
 Apart from these three, one of the three private universities which are not known yet
 jeeyo institute bai reliance foundation, birla istitute of technolji and science-pilaani, manipal academy of hair ajukeshan
 Reliance's Jio Mobile and wifi have created a lot of upheaval in the telecom world
 magar jeeyo institute kya gul khilaaegaa, iskaa kya bajet hoga or kaise yah duniya kii privet uniwarsity ke baraabar pahonchega, abhi dekhte hai magar is suchi main jeeyo institute kaa naam dilachasp he
 We spoke to Furqan Qamar, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities
 phurkan sahab kii ek baat main dam he
 Out of the ten institutes to be included in the Institute of Eminence, only one and a half percent of the students in higher education in the country will be very few
 99 pratishat chaatro ke liye kya ho rahaa he
 You can check the condition by going to the colleges of your states
 50 pratishat faikalti nahin hai yani teacher nahin hai
 Perhaps now this problem has been solved, the pace of fixing them will be so slow that it will not get publicity, but instead of spending big money on ten or twenty institutions and if they achieve rankings, then the headline will also be strong and cover story Will also look bright
 jidi college main 24 hazaar chaatr hai or shikshak 28 hi hai
 Many departments are empty, so why should any college come? ye bihar ke dainik bhaskar kii cliping he
 a teacher has an average of 1059 students
 kisi bhi lihaaz se yah ausat bhayankar he
 No single teacher can teach a thousand students
 daant chiar degaa
 This college is in Begusarai district of Bihar
 hamane apni uniwarsity series main isi zile ke ek or college shri krishna mahila college kaa haal bataaya tha
 There are ten and a half thousand girls and only 9 teachers
 ek shikshak par 1200 chatraayen
 i want to say that the need of these students of India is that of a teacher so that they too can get good education, but they are being shown the milestone by showing the dream of ranking ten universities
 yah usee tarah he ki railgadiyaan 30-40 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai or sapana bullate train kaa dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 You have to decide which priority you will choose
 patna vishvavidhyalay ke 100 saal hone ke maukey par pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki 10 privet or 10 sarkari uniwarsity apana plan lekar aaen, bataaen ki kaise apana vikaas karenge, sarkaar unhen agle paanch saal main 10,000 karod degi
 We checked the record
 2016-17 ke bajet main 20 bhartiya uniwarsity ko duniya kii top 200 main pahunchane ke liye ek khaakaa taiyaar kiya jayega
 But the Minister has issued a plan saying that it is expected that in the next ten years these institutions will come in the top 500 and after that in the top 100
 teen to top 500 main abhi se hai
 Where is the matter of the top 200 in the budget, but declaring the top 500
 sarkaar ne khud hi lakshya kam kar diya kya
 Not only this, it was talked about in the 2016 budget, but by the time half of 2018 has passed, the government has been able to issue a list of only 6 universities
 do dhai saal main aadhe se bhi kam kaa elaan hua he
 Now the matter of the budget was only in the budget of 2016-17, it was not the budget
 2017-18 ke bajet main maatr 50 karod kaa praavdhaan hua
 What could have happened to that money, only the government can tell because between 2017-18, the list of Institute of Eminence did not come up
 2018-19 ke bajet main vishwa stareey santhaan ke naam par 250 karod kaa fund he
 If you look at the budget, till now the government has made a provision of 300 crores for it, whereas it talks of giving 10,000 crores in five years
 2016-17 ke bajet main 20 sansthaanon main se har ek ko har saal 500 karod kii raashi dene kii baat he, is raashi ko agle bajet main badhaakar 1000 karod kar diya jaataa he
 Can we achieve the ranking of the top 200 by spending Rs
1000 crore in 20 years by giving Rs
1000 crore to 20 institutes every year, though HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that these institutions will be given up to one thousand crores in the next five years
 yani har saal ek santhaan ko 200 karod
 What will happen in 200 crores
 agar aapako yah raashi bahut lag rahi he, mile kaa pathar lag rahi he to america kii uniwarsity kaa bajet dekh lijie
 We call it the endowment fund, meaning they have so much money
 - harvard uniwarsity kaa indowment fund he 36 billian dollar kaa yani bhartiya rupee main 2,47,140 karod Yale University's endowment fund is 27
 17 billian dollar yani bhartiya rupee main 1,82,128 karod - Stafford University's Endowment Fund is 24
 78 billian dollar yani bhartiya rupee main 1,70,114 karod Howard's endowment fund is about 2
5 million rupees
 30 june 2017 ko samaapt hue vitt varsh main harvard uniwarsity ne 33,638 karod kharch kiya tha
 Harvard University has 22,000 students
 kya aap jaanate hai 9 karod kii aabaadi vaale bihar kaa salanaa anumaanit vyay yani bajet kitna he
 This year's budget of Bihar is 1 lakh 76 thousand crores
 2016-17 main bihar ne ucch shiksha, khel kud, kala samskruti par 20,394 karod karch kiya
 Of this, 22 percent was spent on salary
 2017-18 main 26,394 karod ke bajet main selary kaa hissaa ghat kar 19
 Done 5
 yani ek saal main selary par teen pratishat kii giravat
 This meant that new teachers were less restored
 kya bharat kii koi bhi uniwarsity harvard, yel yaa stenford kii barabari kar sakati he? kyon nahin kar sakati he magar 10,000 karod yaa is tarah ke ravaiye se to nahin kar sakati
 In 2016 itself, it was said that 20 institutions would be elected, but after the end of half of 2018, 6 institutes are being announced, out of which one Jio Institute has not been established yet
 niraash na hon, harvard uniwarsity 1636 main kaayam hui thi, yel uniwarsity 1701 main bani or stannford 1891 main bani
 What do you get before Harvard and Yale, i don't want to hurt
 stencort ke pehle bharat main aligarh muslim uniwarsity, elahabaad uniwarsity, kolkata uniwarsity or madras uniwarsity kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 This is all to know
 jaananaa or prachaar donon alag kriyaayein hai
 The comments indore kii medical chaatra smriti laharpure ne fees ke dabaav se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Students of several medical colleges demanded action based on Smriti Laharpure's suicide note
 chaar hafte tak smriti ke mata-pita maare-maare phirte rahe tab jaakar shanivaar ko indore police ne smriti ke medical college ke chairman or echodi ke khilaaf aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla darj kiya he
 Resident doctors of AIIMS Delhi also conducted a candle march in Delhi and demanded action
 paanch saal embibies karne ke baad smriti laharpure ne index medical college main post graduate course ke liye jwine kiya
 Smriti was selected through the examination of NEET
 admician ke samay tution fees thi 8 lakh 56 hazaar or hostal fees 2 lakh maangi gai
 When reached to take admission, the students were asked to submit 2 lakh more
 kuch samay baad phir kaha gaya ki 1 lakh 35 hazaar or jamaa karen
 Medical college students went to Jabalpur court
 smriti is andolan kaa netritv kar rahi thim
 The court ruled in favor of the students but the college asked for more fees
 uske baad kii sthiti se tang aakar smriti laharpure ne aatmahatya kar lee
 This kind of loot is going on in every medical college
 chaatr pratiyogita ke zarie chune jate hai
 After passing the NEET exam
 magar vahaan pehle saal kii fees kuch or hoti he or duusare saal kii kuch or
 Sometimes there is a difference of five to a million in both
 bahut saare saadhaaran pariwaron ke chaatr is chakki main pis jate hai
 Like a slave, they continue to pay fees by taking loans
 ames ke resident doctoron ke sanghathan ne kai saare resident doctoron ke sanghathan ko milakar ek deshvyapee sanghathan banaaya he
 Harjit Bhatti says that this plunder of fees in private medical colleges is making it difficult for the children of poor and ordinary families to survive in medicine
 is hadtaal ke kaaran vahi hai jo bharat ke anek uniwarsity main maujuud hai

 prakaash jaavdekar ne twit kiya he ki ye landmark inishiative he yani mile kaa pathar sabit hone vaala kadam he
 He has tweeted because a panel of government experts has selected the institute of Eminence
 aaj ham 6 vishvavidhyalayon kii suchi jari kar rahe hai
 3 are government and 3 are private
 instituteofeminence desh ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn hai
 We have 800 universities but not a single university is in the top 100 or 200 in the world
 aaj ke faisle se hamen ye hasil karne main madad milegi
 There are no 115 teachers in Manipur University, not many colleges and universities like him, but India feels that the first task is to reach the top 100 or 200
 acha he, ye zid honi chahie magar ye dhun bhi honi chahie ki 95 fisadi chaatro ke liye uniwarsity or college hai wo kam se kam padhane or padhaane laayak ho saken
 It is not right to rely too much on ranking
 kahin isaki haalat tiarapy jaisi na ho jaae
 Prakash Javadekar gave a statement during Question Hour in Lok Sabha on 20 March 2017 that within a year, 9000 teachers will be appointed in Delhi University
 ek saal biit gaya
 This is the situation here in Delhi
 classroom main shikshakon ko niyukt karnaa bhi landmark disijan hona chahie magar ranking kii zid kaa aakarshan shaayad badi khabar he
 The six universities selected are IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore
 in teen sansthaanon ke naam pehle bhi duniya kii ranking main aate rahe hai
 The Indian Institute of Science ranks between 251 and 300 in the Times Higher Education rankings
 iaiti dilli or bombai kaa sthaan 500 se 600 main he
 Apart from these three, one of the three private universities which are not known yet
 jeeyo institute bai reliance foundation, birla istitute of technolji and science-pilaani, manipal academy of hair ajukeshan
 Reliance's Jio Mobile and wifi have created a lot of upheaval in the telecom world
 magar jeeyo institute kya gul khilaaegaa, iskaa kya bajet hoga or kaise yah duniya kii privet uniwarsity ke baraabar pahonchega, abhi dekhte hai magar is suchi main jeeyo institute kaa naam dilachasp he
 We spoke to Furqan Qamar, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities
 phurkan sahab kii ek baat main dam he
 Out of the ten institutes to be included in the Institute of Eminence, only one and a half percent of the students in higher education in the country will be very few
 99 pratishat chaatro ke liye kya ho rahaa he
 You can check the condition by going to the colleges of your states
 50 pratishat faikalti nahin hai yani teacher nahin hai
 Perhaps now this problem has been solved, the pace of fixing them will be so slow that it will not get publicity, but instead of spending big money on ten or twenty institutions and if they achieve rankings, then the headline will also be strong and cover story Will also look bright
 jidi college main 24 hazaar chaatr hai or shikshak 28 hi hai
 Many departments are empty, so why should any college come? ye bihar ke dainik bhaskar kii cliping he
 a teacher has an average of 1059 students
 kisi bhi lihaaz se yah ausat bhayankar he
 No single teacher can teach a thousand students
 daant chiar degaa
 This college is in Begusarai district of Bihar
 hamane apni uniwarsity series main isi zile ke ek or college shri krishna mahila college kaa haal bataaya tha
 There are ten and a half thousand girls and only 9 teachers
 ek shikshak par 1200 chatraayen
 i want to say that the need of these students of India is that of a teacher so that they too can get good education, but they are being shown the milestone by showing the dream of ranking ten universities
 yah usee tarah he ki railgadiyaan 30-40 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai or sapana bullate train kaa dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 You have to decide which priority you will choose
 patna vishvavidhyalay ke 100 saal hone ke maukey par pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki 10 privet or 10 sarkari uniwarsity apana plan lekar aaen, bataaen ki kaise apana vikaas karenge, sarkaar unhen agle paanch saal main 10,000 karod degi
 We checked the record
 2016-17 ke bajet main 20 bhartiya uniwarsity ko duniya kii top 200 main pahunchane ke liye ek khaakaa taiyaar kiya jayega
 But the Minister has issued a plan saying that it is expected that in the next ten years these institutions will come in the top 500 and after that in the top 100
 teen to top 500 main abhi se hai
 Where is the matter of the top 200 in the budget, but declaring the top 500
 sarkaar ne khud hi lakshya kam kar diya kya
 Not only this, it was talked about in the 2016 budget, but by the time half of 2018 has passed, the government has been able to issue a list of only 6 universities
 do dhai saal main aadhe se bhi kam kaa elaan hua he
 Now the matter of the budget was only in the budget of 2016-17, it was not the budget
 2017-18 ke bajet main maatr 50 karod kaa praavdhaan hua
 What could have happened to that money, only the government can tell because between 2017-18, the list of Institute of Eminence did not come up
 2018-19 ke bajet main vishwa stareey santhaan ke naam par 250 karod kaa fund he
 If you look at the budget, till now the government has made a provision of 300 crores for it, whereas it talks of giving 10,000 crores in five years
 2016-17 ke bajet main 20 sansthaanon main se har ek ko har saal 500 karod kii raashi dene kii baat he, is raashi ko agle bajet main badhaakar 1000 karod kar diya jaataa he
 Can we achieve the ranking of the top 200 by spending Rs
1000 crore in 20 years by giving Rs
1000 crore to 20 institutes every year, though HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that these institutions will be given up to one thousand crores in the next five years
 yani har saal ek santhaan ko 200 karod
 What will happen in 200 crores
 agar aapako yah raashi bahut lag rahi he, mile kaa pathar lag rahi he to america kii uniwarsity kaa bajet dekh lijie
 We call it the endowment fund, meaning they have so much money
 - harvard uniwarsity kaa indowment fund he 36 billian dollar kaa yani bhartiya rupee main 2,47,140 karod Yale University's endowment fund is 27
 17 billian dollar yani bhartiya rupee main 1,82,128 karod - Stafford University's Endowment Fund is 24
 78 billian dollar yani bhartiya rupee main 1,70,114 karod Howard's endowment fund is about 2
5 million rupees
 30 june 2017 ko samaapt hue vitt varsh main harvard uniwarsity ne 33,638 karod kharch kiya tha
 Harvard University has 22,000 students
 kya aap jaanate hai 9 karod kii aabaadi vaale bihar kaa salanaa anumaanit vyay yani bajet kitna he
 This year's budget of Bihar is 1 lakh 76 thousand crores
 2016-17 main bihar ne ucch shiksha, khel kud, kala samskruti par 20,394 karod karch kiya
 Of this, 22 percent was spent on salary
 2017-18 main 26,394 karod ke bajet main selary kaa hissaa ghat kar 19
 Done 5
 yani ek saal main selary par teen pratishat kii giravat
 This meant that new teachers were less restored
 kya bharat kii koi bhi uniwarsity harvard, yel yaa stenford kii barabari kar sakati he? kyon nahin kar sakati he magar 10,000 karod yaa is tarah ke ravaiye se to nahin kar sakati
 In 2016 itself, it was said that 20 institutions would be elected, but after the end of half of 2018, 6 institutes are being announced, out of which one Jio Institute has not been established yet
 niraash na hon, harvard uniwarsity 1636 main kaayam hui thi, yel uniwarsity 1701 main bani or stannford 1891 main bani
 What do you get before Harvard and Yale, i don't want to hurt
 stencort ke pehle bharat main aligarh muslim uniwarsity, elahabaad uniwarsity, kolkata uniwarsity or madras uniwarsity kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 This is all to know
 jaananaa or prachaar donon alag kriyaayein hai
 The comments indore kii medical chaatra smriti laharpure ne fees ke dabaav se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Students of several medical colleges demanded action based on Smriti Laharpure's suicide note
 chaar hafte tak smriti ke mata-pita maare-maare phirte rahe tab jaakar shanivaar ko indore police ne smriti ke medical college ke chairman or echodi ke khilaaf aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla darj kiya he
 Resident doctors of AIIMS Delhi also conducted a candle march in Delhi and demanded action
 paanch saal embibies karne ke baad smriti laharpure ne index medical college main post graduate course ke liye jwine kiya
 Smriti was selected through the examination of NEET
 admician ke samay tution fees thi 8 lakh 56 hazaar or hostal fees 2 lakh maangi gai
 When reached to take admission, the students were asked to submit 2 lakh more
 kuch samay baad phir kaha gaya ki 1 lakh 35 hazaar or jamaa karen
 Medical college students went to Jabalpur court
 smriti is andolan kaa netritv kar rahi thim
 The court ruled in favor of the students but the college asked for more fees
 uske baad kii sthiti se tang aakar smriti laharpure ne aatmahatya kar lee
 This kind of loot is going on in every medical college
 chaatr pratiyogita ke zarie chune jate hai
 After passing the NEET exam
 magar vahaan pehle saal kii fees kuch or hoti he or duusare saal kii kuch or
 Sometimes there is a difference of five to a million in both
 bahut saare saadhaaran pariwaron ke chaatr is chakki main pis jate hai
 Like a slave, they continue to pay fees by taking loans
 ames ke resident doctoron ke sanghathan ne kai saare resident doctoron ke sanghathan ko milakar ek deshvyapee sanghathan banaaya he
 Harjit Bhatti says that this plunder of fees in private medical colleges is making it difficult for the children of poor and ordinary families to survive in medicine
 ab baat is jagah pahunch gai he ki chaatro or shikshak sangh kaa kahana he ki jab tak vaais chancelar adya prasad pandey ko hataaya nahin jayega, is hadtaal kaa koi samaadhaan nahin hoga
 This strike, which has been going on for forty days, was noticed today because on Sunday the teachers have resigned from the post of president of all departments
 manipur medical science ke dean ko chhod kar paanch dean ne istipha de diya
 The Vice Chancellor is describing the students as extremist supporters
 unka kahana he ki unhen hataane ke liye dean or vibhaagon ke adhyaksh par dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he
 While teachers say that a high level committee should investigate all the allegations against the Vice Chancellor
 shikshakon ke sangh muta ne pradhanmantri, chif rector or maanav sansaadhan mantri or mukhyamantri se dakhal dene kii apil kii he
 The teachers have also given one day salary to run the mess in the hostel because all the work has come to a standstill due to this strike
 chaatro ne sabhi vibhaagon main taala laga diya he
 The Chief Minister of Manipur has also called and spoken to the President of Teachers Association
 ravivaar ko chaatro or shikshakon ne aarope lagaaya he ki uniwarsity campus main bahari tatwon ko bulaayaa gaya he taaki avyavashtha failaai ja sake
 Now that the time for talks is gone, the only solution is to have the Vice Chancellor removed
 adya prasad pandey oktober 2016 main vaais chancelar bane the
 Adya Prasad Pandey has been a student of Banaras Hindu University
 1979 se biechayu main padhaa rahe hai
 He was the chairman of bhu's economics department before becoming a VC of Manipur University
 kya aap jaanate hai ki desh kii 80 pratishat shiksha collejon main hoti he or unki haalat bahut karaab he
 90 percent of higher education is done in state universities whose condition is worse
 in par kya dhyaan diya ja rahaa he, kuch pataa nahin he

 Students have locked in all departments
 manipur ke mukhyamantri ne shikshak sangh ke adhyaksh se bulaakar baat bhi kii he
 On Sunday, students and teachers alleged that external elements were called to the university campus to spread the disorder

 Adya Prasad Pandey became the Vice Chancellor in October 2016

 Studying at BHU since 1979

 Do you know that 80 percent of the country's education takes place in colleges and their condition is very bad
 90 pratishat ucch shiksha rajya uniwarsity main hoti he jinaki haalat or bhi karaab he
 What attention is being paid to these, nothing is known
 is baat kaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum ki 9 july yani aaj ke din maanav sansaadhan mantri ne istitute of eminance kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Prakash Javadekar has tweeted that this is the Landmark Initiative i
e
 a step to prove to be a milestone
 unhone twit isliye kiya he kyonki sarkaar ke export ke panel ne institute of Eminence kaa chayan kar liya he
 Today we are releasing the list of 6 universities
 3 sarkari hai or 3 privet hai
 instituteofeminence are quite important for the country
 hamaare paas 800 uniwarsity hai lekin ek bhi uniwarsity duniya kii top 100 yaa 200 main nahin he
 Today's decision will help us achieve this
 manipur uniwarsity main 115 teacher nahin hai, uske jaise na jane kitne college or uniwarsity main teacher nahin hai magar bharat ko lagata he ki pehla kaam top 100 yaa 200 main aa janaa he
 It is good, it should be stubborn, but it should also be tuned that there are universities and colleges for 95 per cent students, at least they should be able to read and teach
 ranking par bahut adhik bharosa karnaa thik nahin hota he
 Somewhere its condition does not become like TRP
 prakaash jaavdekar ne 20 march 2017 ko loksabhaa main prashn kaal ke dauraan bayaan diya tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity main 9000 shikshak niyukt kar denge
 a year passed
 yaheen dilli main ye haal he
 Appointing teachers in the classroom should also be a landmark decision, but the stubbornness of the rankings is probably big news
 jin chah uniwarsity kaa chayan hua he unamem naam hai iaiti dilli, iaiti bombai, indian istitute of science bangaloru bhi shaamil hai
 The names of these three institutions have been in the world ranking even earlier
 times hair ajukeshan ranking main indian istitute of science kaa sthaan 251 se 300 ke bich he
 IIT Delhi and Bombay are ranked between 500 and 600
 in teenon ke alaava jo teen privet uniwarsity hai unamem se ek ke bare main abhi kuch khaas pataa nahin he
 Jio Institute by Reliance Foundation, Birla Institute of Technology and science-pilani, Manipal Academy of Higher Education
 reliance kaa jeeyo mobile or wifai ne telecom kii duniya main kaaphi uthal puthal machaa di he
 But what will the Jio Institute feed, what will be its budget and how will it reach the private universities of the world, let's see now, but the name of Jio Institute is interesting in this list
 hamane association of indian uniwarsity ke mahasachiv furqaan qamar se baat kii
 Furkan Sahab has a point
 jin das sansthaanon ko institute of eminance main shaamil kiya janaa he usamen ucch shiksha main desh bhar ke chaatro kaa sava pratishat chaatr hi honge jo ki bahut kam hai
 What's happening to 99 percent of the students
 aap apane-apane rajyon ke collejon main jaakar haalat dekh sakate hai
 50 percent are not faculty, that is, not teachers
 shaayad ab yah samasya belgaum ho chuki he, inhen thik karne kii raftaar itani dhimi hogi ki usase prachaar nahin hoga magar isaki jagah das bees sansthaanon par bada paisa kharch kiya jaae or ve ranking hasil kar len to use lekar hedline bhi tagdi banegi or cover story bhi chamakdaar lagegi
 GD College has 24,000 students and 28 teachers
 kai vibhaag khaali hai to koi college aae hi kyon
 This is a clipping of Dainik Bhaskar of Bihar
 ek shikshak par 1059 chaatr kaa ausat he
 In any sense, this average is terrible
 koi bhi akelaa shikshak ek hazaar chaatro ko padhaa hi nahin saktaa he
 Gives teeth yah college bihar ke begusarai zile main he
 In our university series, we told about the condition of another college of Shri Krishna Mahila College in this district
 vahaan saadhe das hazaar chatraayen hai or maatr 9 shikshak hai
 1200 girls on one teacher
 main kahana yah chahta hum ki zarurat bharat ke in chaatro ko shikshak kii he taaki ve bhi acchhee padhai hasil kar saken magar unhen das uniwarsity kii ranking kaa sapana dikhaa kar mile kaa pathar bataaya ja rahaa he

 On the occasion of 100 years of Patna University, Prime Minister Modi had said that 10 private and 10 government universities should bring their plan, tell how they will develop themselves, the government will give them 10,000 crore in the next five years
 hamane record check kiya
 In the 2016-17 budget, a blueprint will be prepared to make 20 Indian universities among the top 200 in the world
 magar mantri ji ne plan jari karte hue kaha he ki ummid he ki agle das saal main ye santhaan top 500 main aa jaaenge or uske baad top 100 main
 Three are still in the top 500
 kahaan to bajet main top 200 kii baat he magar elaan karte hue top 500 ho gaya
 Did the government itself reduce the target? yahi nahin, 2016 ke bajet main isaki baat thi magar 2018 aadha biit gaya tab tak sarkaar sirf 6 uniwarsity kii hi list jari kar saki he
 Less than half has been announced in two and a half years
 ab rahi bajet kii baat to 2016-17 ke bajet main sirf baat thi, bajet nahin tha
 Provision of only 50 crores in the budget of 2017-18
 us paise kaa kya hua hoga, sarkaar hi bataa sakati he kyonki 2017-18 ke bich to institute of eminance kii suchi hi nahin ai
 The 2018-19 budget has a fund of 250 crore in the name of a world-class institution
 agar bajet dekhen to abhi tak sarkaar ne iske liye 300 karod kaa hi praavdhaan kiya he jabaki vah paanch saal main 10,000 karod dene kii baat karti he
 In the budget of 2016-17, there is a matter of giving 500 crore every year to each of the 20 institutions, this amount is increased to 1000 crore in the next budget
 kya ham har saal 20 santhaan ko 1000 karod dekar paanch saal main 10,000 karod kharch kar top 200 kii ranking hasil kar sakate hai, vaise maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne kaha he ki in sansthaanon ko agle paanch saal main ek hazaar karod tak diya jayega
 That is 200 crore to an institution every year
 200 karod main kya hoga
 If you are finding this amount too much, you are seeing milestones, then look at the budget of the University of America
 ise ham indowment fund bolte hai matlab itane paise kaa fund hai inke paas

 matlab yah hua ki nae shikshak kam behaal hue
 Can any university in India match Harvard, Yale or Stanford? Why can't she do it but can't do 10,000 crores or this kind of attitude
 2016 main hi kaha gaya tha ki 20 sansthaanon kaa chunaav hoga lekin 2018 kaa aadha biit jane par 6 sansthaanon kaa elaan ho rahaa he, usamen se ek jeeyo institute abhi kaayam nahin hui he

 Do you know that 80 percent of the country's education takes place in colleges and their condition is very bad
 90 pratishat ucch shiksha rajya uniwarsity main hoti he jinaki haalat or bhi karaab he
 What attention is being paid to these, nothing is known
 is baat kaa zikr isliye kar rahaa hum ki 9 july yani aaj ke din maanav sansaadhan mantri ne istitute of eminance kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Prakash Javadekar has tweeted that this is the Landmark Initiative i
e
 a step to prove to be a milestone
 unhone twit isliye kiya he kyonki sarkaar ke export ke panel ne institute of Eminence kaa chayan kar liya he
 Today we are releasing the list of 6 universities
 3 sarkari hai or 3 privet hai
 instituteofeminence are quite important for the country
 hamaare paas 800 uniwarsity hai lekin ek bhi uniwarsity duniya kii top 100 yaa 200 main nahin he
 Today's decision will help us achieve this
 manipur uniwarsity main 115 teacher nahin hai, uske jaise na jane kitne college or uniwarsity main teacher nahin hai magar bharat ko lagata he ki pehla kaam top 100 yaa 200 main aa janaa he
 It is good, it should be stubborn, but it should also be tuned that there are universities and colleges for 95 per cent students, at least they should be able to read and teach
 ranking par bahut adhik bharosa karnaa thik nahin hota he
 Somewhere its condition does not become like TRP
 prakaash jaavdekar ne 20 march 2017 ko loksabhaa main prashn kaal ke dauraan bayaan diya tha ki ek saal ke bheetar dilli uniwarsity main 9000 shikshak niyukt kar denge
 a year passed
 yaheen dilli main ye haal he
 Appointing teachers in the classroom should also be a landmark decision, but the stubbornness of the rankings is probably big news
 jin chah uniwarsity kaa chayan hua he unamem naam hai iaiti dilli, iaiti bombai, indian istitute of science bangaloru bhi shaamil hai
 The names of these three institutions have been in the world ranking even earlier
 times hair ajukeshan ranking main indian istitute of science kaa sthaan 251 se 300 ke bich he
 IIT Delhi and Bombay are ranked between 500 and 600
 in teenon ke alaava jo teen privet uniwarsity hai unamem se ek ke bare main abhi kuch khaas pataa nahin he
 Jio Institute by Reliance Foundation, Birla Institute of Technology and science-pilani, Manipal Academy of Higher Education
 reliance kaa jeeyo mobile or wifai ne telecom kii duniya main kaaphi uthal puthal machaa di he
 But what will the Jio Institute feed, what will be its budget and how will it reach the private universities of the world, let's see now, but the name of Jio Institute is interesting in this list

 What's happening to 99 percent of the students
 aap apane-apane rajyon ke collejon main jaakar haalat dekh sakate hai
 50 percent are not faculty, that is, not teachers
 shaayad ab yah samasya belgaum ho chuki he, inhen thik karne kii raftaar itani dhimi hogi ki usase prachaar nahin hoga magar isaki jagah das bees sansthaanon par bada paisa kharch kiya jaae or ve ranking hasil kar len to use lekar hedline bhi tagdi banegi or cover story bhi chamakdaar lagegi

 In the 2016-17 budget, a blueprint will be prepared to make 20 Indian universities among the top 200 in the world

 Three are still in the top 500

 There are no 115 teachers in Manipur University, not many colleges and universities like him, but India feels that the first task is to reach the top 100 or 200
 acha he, ye zid honi chahie magar ye dhun bhi honi chahie ki 95 fisadi chaatro ke liye uniwarsity or college hai wo kam se kam padhane or padhaane laayak ho saken
 It is not right to rely too much on ranking
 kahin isaki haalat tiarapy jaisi na ho jaae
 Prakash Javadekar gave a statement during Question Hour in Lok Sabha on 20 March 2017 that within a year, 9000 teachers will be appointed in Delhi University
 ek saal biit gaya
 This is the situation here in Delhi
 classroom main shikshakon ko niyukt karnaa bhi landmark disijan hona chahie magar ranking kii zid kaa aakarshan shaayad badi khabar he
 The six universities selected are IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore
 in teen sansthaanon ke naam pehle bhi duniya kii ranking main aate rahe hai
 The Indian Institute of Science ranks between 251 and 300 in the Times Higher Education rankings
 iaiti dilli or bombai kaa sthaan 500 se 600 main he
 Apart from these three, one of the three private universities which are not known yet
 jeeyo institute bai reliance foundation, birla istitute of technolji and science-pilaani, manipal academy of hair ajukeshan
 Reliance's Jio Mobile and wifi have created a lot of upheaval in the telecom world
 magar jeeyo institute kya gul khilaaegaa, iskaa kya bajet hoga or kaise yah duniya kii privet uniwarsity ke baraabar pahonchega, abhi dekhte hai magar is suchi main jeeyo institute kaa naam dilachasp he
 We spoke to Furqan Qamar, Secretary General of the Association of Indian Universities
 phurkan sahab kii ek baat main dam he
 Out of the ten institutes to be included in the Institute of Eminence, only one and a half percent of the students in higher education in the country will be very few
 99 pratishat chaatro ke liye kya ho rahaa he
 You can check the condition by going to the colleges of your states
 50 pratishat faikalti nahin hai yani teacher nahin hai
 Perhaps now this problem has been solved, the pace of fixing them will be so slow that it will not get publicity, but instead of spending big money on ten or twenty institutions and if they achieve rankings, then the headline will also be strong and cover story Will also look bright
 jidi college main 24 hazaar chaatr hai or shikshak 28 hi hai
 Many departments are empty, so why should any college come? ye bihar ke dainik bhaskar kii cliping he
 a teacher has an average of 1059 students
 kisi bhi lihaaz se yah ausat bhayankar he
 No single teacher can teach a thousand students
 daant chiar degaa
 This college is in Begusarai district of Bihar
 hamane apni uniwarsity series main isi zile ke ek or college shri krishna mahila college kaa haal bataaya tha
 There are ten and a half thousand girls and only 9 teachers
 ek shikshak par 1200 chatraayen
 i want to say that the need of these students of India is that of a teacher so that they too can get good education, but they are being shown the milestone by showing the dream of ranking ten universities
 yah usee tarah he ki railgadiyaan 30-40 ghante kii deree se chal rahi hai or sapana bullate train kaa dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 You have to decide which priority you will choose
 patna vishvavidhyalay ke 100 saal hone ke maukey par pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki 10 privet or 10 sarkari uniwarsity apana plan lekar aaen, bataaen ki kaise apana vikaas karenge, sarkaar unhen agle paanch saal main 10,000 karod degi
 We checked the record
 2016-17 ke bajet main 20 bhartiya uniwarsity ko duniya kii top 200 main pahunchane ke liye ek khaakaa taiyaar kiya jayega
 But the Minister has issued a plan saying that it is expected that in the next ten years these institutions will come in the top 500 and after that in the top 100
 teen to top 500 main abhi se hai
 Where is the matter of the top 200 in the budget, but declaring the top 500
 sarkaar ne khud hi lakshya kam kar diya kya
 Not only this, it was talked about in the 2016 budget, but by the time half of 2018 has passed, the government has been able to issue a list of only 6 universities
 do dhai saal main aadhe se bhi kam kaa elaan hua he
 Now the matter of the budget was only in the budget of 2016-17, it was not the budget
 2017-18 ke bajet main maatr 50 karod kaa praavdhaan hua
 What could have happened to that money, only the government can tell because between 2017-18, the list of Institute of Eminence did not come up
 2018-19 ke bajet main vishwa stareey santhaan ke naam par 250 karod kaa fund he
 If you look at the budget, till now the government has made a provision of 300 crores for it, whereas it talks of giving 10,000 crores in five years
 2016-17 ke bajet main 20 sansthaanon main se har ek ko har saal 500 karod kii raashi dene kii baat he, is raashi ko agle bajet main badhaakar 1000 karod kar diya jaataa he
 Can we achieve the ranking of the top 200 by spending Rs
1000 crore in 20 years by giving Rs
1000 crore to 20 institutes every year, though HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that these institutions will be given up to one thousand crores in the next five years
 yani har saal ek santhaan ko 200 karod
 What will happen in 200 crores
 agar aapako yah raashi bahut lag rahi he, mile kaa pathar lag rahi he to america kii uniwarsity kaa bajet dekh lijie
 We call it the endowment fund, meaning they have so much money
 - harvard uniwarsity kaa indowment fund he 36 billian dollar kaa yani bhartiya rupee main 2,47,140 karod Yale University's endowment fund is 27
 17 billian dollar yani bhartiya rupee main 1,82,128 karod - Stafford University's Endowment Fund is 24
 78 billian dollar yani bhartiya rupee main 1,70,114 karod Howard's endowment fund is about 2
5 million rupees
 30 june 2017 ko samaapt hue vitt varsh main harvard uniwarsity ne 33,638 karod kharch kiya tha
 Harvard University has 22,000 students
 kya aap jaanate hai 9 karod kii aabaadi vaale bihar kaa salanaa anumaanit vyay yani bajet kitna he
 This year's budget of Bihar is 1 lakh 76 thousand crores
 2016-17 main bihar ne ucch shiksha, khel kud, kala samskruti par 20,394 karod karch kiya
 Of this, 22 percent was spent on salary
 2017-18 main 26,394 karod ke bajet main selary kaa hissaa ghat kar 19
 Done 5
 yani ek saal main selary par teen pratishat kii giravat
 This meant that new teachers were less restored
 kya bharat kii koi bhi uniwarsity harvard, yel yaa stenford kii barabari kar sakati he? kyon nahin kar sakati he magar 10,000 karod yaa is tarah ke ravaiye se to nahin kar sakati
 In 2016 itself, it was said that 20 institutions would be elected, but after the end of half of 2018, 6 institutes are being announced, out of which one Jio Institute has not been established yet
 niraash na hon, harvard uniwarsity 1636 main kaayam hui thi, yel uniwarsity 1701 main bani or stannford 1891 main bani
 What do you get before Harvard and Yale, i don't want to hurt
 stencort ke pehle bharat main aligarh muslim uniwarsity, elahabaad uniwarsity, kolkata uniwarsity or madras uniwarsity kii sthapana ho chuki thi
 This is all to know
 jaananaa or prachaar donon alag kriyaayein hai
 The comments indore kii medical chaatra smriti laharpure ne fees ke dabaav se tang aakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Students of several medical colleges demanded action based on Smriti Laharpure's suicide note
 chaar hafte tak smriti ke mata-pita maare-maare phirte rahe tab jaakar shanivaar ko indore police ne smriti ke medical college ke chairman or echodi ke khilaaf aatmahatya ke liye uksaane kaa maamla darj kiya he
 Resident doctors of AIIMS Delhi also conducted a candle march in Delhi and demanded action
 paanch saal embibies karne ke baad smriti laharpure ne index medical college main post graduate course ke liye jwine kiya
 Smriti was selected through the examination of NEET
 admician ke samay tution fees thi 8 lakh 56 hazaar or hostal fees 2 lakh maangi gai
 When reached to take admission, the students were asked to submit 2 lakh more
 kuch samay baad phir kaha gaya ki 1 lakh 35 hazaar or jamaa karen
 Medical college students went to Jabalpur court
 smriti is andolan kaa netritv kar rahi thim
 The court ruled in favor of the students but the college asked for more fees
 uske baad kii sthiti se tang aakar smriti laharpure ne aatmahatya kar lee
 This kind of loot is going on in every medical college
 chaatr pratiyogita ke zarie chune jate hai
 After passing the NEET exam
 magar vahaan pehle saal kii fees kuch or hoti he or duusare saal kii kuch or
 Sometimes there is a difference of five to a million in both
 bahut saare saadhaaran pariwaron ke chaatr is chakki main pis jate hai
 Like a slave, they continue to pay fees by taking loans
 ames ke resident doctoron ke sanghathan ne kai saare resident doctoron ke sanghathan ko milakar ek deshvyapee sanghathan banaaya he
 Harjit Bhatti says that this plunder of fees in private medical colleges is making it difficult for the children of poor and ordinary families to survive in medicine
 reliance kaa jeeyo mobile or wifai ne telecom kii duniya main kaaphi uthal puthal machaa di he
 But what will the Jio Institute feed, what will be its budget and how will it reach the private universities of the world, let's see now, but the name of Jio Institute is interesting in this list

 But the scale of selection also changed with the changing times and ways of playing
 indian premier lig (ipel) ne khilaadiyon par na sirf jamkar dhan barsaaya he, balki team india main khilne kaa sapana bhi saakaar kiya he
 Ravindra Jadeja, Mohit Sharma, Saurabh Tiwari, Parvinder Awana, Manpreet Singh Goni, Stuart Binny, Rahul Sharma and Sudeep Tyagi are some of the players who made it to Team India through the IPL
 is sijan bhi kuch aise khilaadi najar aa rahe hai jo aage chal kar team india main apni daavedaari pesh kar sakate hai
 These are the players who have raised hopes: Deepak Hooda: On a big stage like IPL, this batsman has won the hearts of big legends at a very young age
 rajasthan royles ke ab tak ke shandaar safar main is ballebaaj ne behad ahm kirdaar nibhaayaa he
 On the big stage, not only the talent of the player matters but the temperament is also very important
 jis nidarta se is 19 varshiya yuva ballebaaj ne world class gendbaajon ko dhoyaa he isse inke tallent ke bare main saaf taur par pataa chal jaataa he
 Along with batting, they are also capable of providing part time spin bowling
 baroda ke liye ranjai khilne vaale hooda ne gharelu cricket main bhi khub jalawaa dikhaaya he
 He 50 in 8 first class matches
 63 kii shandaar ausat se 557 ran banaae hai
 If this consistency continues in the coming time, Hooda can be included in Team India one day
 mayank agarwal:dilli dairedevills ke salaami ballebaaj mayank agarwal ek aise khilaadi hai jo apni inings ko bild karnaa jaanate hai

 There is no big name in bowling except Mitchell Johnson in Kings XI Punjab
 lekin sandip ne apane hunar se kabhi isaki kami khalane nahin di he
 Kings XI Punjab bowling coach and former India bowling coach Joe Dawes are also impressed with Sandeep's bowling
 dawes ne kaha he ki abhi to nahin lekin ek din sandip bharat ke liye jarur khelegaa
 21-year-old Sandeep has taken 111 wickets in 27 first class matches
 suryakumar yadav:24 varshiya suryakumar yadav kolkata nite rides ke liye ipel main dhooma machaa rahe hai
 In the last IPL season, Yadav was given the role of finisher
 lekin is baar unhone apni ballebaaji main or improvement kiya he or ab vah team ke liye koi bhi role nibhaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Knight Rider 's mentor Jack Kallis is highly impressed with Suryakumar's batting

 manan vohara:kings ilevan punjab ke top order ballebaaj manan vohara ko beshak in dinon zyada maukey nahin mil rahe hai lekin vah lambii res ke ghode hai
 The 21-year-old Vohra, who played the role of opener last year, was quite a consul for Punjab, but this year Murali Vijay's arrival does not give him a chance in the team
 lekin jis prakaar kii unki takanic or temprament he usase vah aane vaale samay main apni daavedaari jarur pesh kar sakate hai

 All these players have tremendous talent but they will have to do better in domestic cricket regularly, only then will the opening of Team India for these players

 DMK had just four seats in its favor against more than 200 seats
 diemke ne chunaav abhiyaan jayalalita ke raaj main bhrashtachariyon ko sajaa dilaane ke vaade par hi chalaaya tha
 So, the new government had many corruption cases against him

 In this case, during the third and most successful tenure of Jayalalithaa in power, on September 27, a special court found him guilty of amassing disproportionate assets and sentenced him to four years imprisonment

 But Jayalalithaa and her colleagues challenged their formation and their ability to hear the case

 In August 2005, the Supreme Court stayed the process of combining the two cases

 Meanwhile, the DMK returned to power in the 2006 assembly elections and decided to close the hotel case in 2009

 He was a former District Judge who was the Vigilance Registrar in the Karnataka High Court
 unhone yah pakkaa kiya ki maamla bina kisi deree ke aage bade or unhone daleelon ko ek saal se kam main hi nibata diya
 In one case, he also imposed a fine of Rs 60,000 on Singh as a punishment for missing out of court for two days

 Whoever saw that dreadful scene of the Kedarnath tragedy, he would hardly forget it
 us bhayanak traasadee main kitne logon kii jeevanalila khatm ho gai, iskaa koi sahi-sahi anumaan ab tak nahin lag paaya he
 But it is said that the world rests on hope, Vijender Kanwar was waiting for his wife Leela
 aakhirkaar unki ummiido ko pankh lage or us bheeshan traasadee ke kareeb 18 maheene baad vijender ko unki patni lila mil gai
 Vijender works as a driver at Bhikampur in Alwar district in Rajasthan
 ve 12 june 2013 ko bas lekar patni lila or 30 anya yatriyon ke saath tirthayatra par uttarakhand gaye the
 On June 16, 2013, thousands of people were killed in a flood in Kedarnath
 isi haadase main vijender kii patni lila bhi bichad gai thi
 Everyone was assuming that Leela would have died in this horrific catastrophe
 lekin vijender ne haar nahin maani or lila kii tasviir liye uttarakhand ke pahaado main khojane lage
 And Vijender gets Leela
 
 
 aakhirkaar vijender ke liye wo khushi kaa lamhaa mangalvaar 3 farvari 2015 ko aayaa
 When people in a village in Uttarkashi district told him that a mad woman with a similar appearance was seen in a nearby Gangoli village
 vijender ne jab us mahila ko dekha to vah unki patni lila hi thi
 Seeing Leela, Vijender was not happy, he brought Leela with him to the village
 uttarakhand main gum hue logon ko prashasan mrit maan chukaa he or muaavja bhi baanta ja chukaa he
 Leela was also included in this, Leela's family has received Rs 10 lakh as compensation in the last year
 vijender kaa kahana he ki lila ko dhundne main hi unke kareeb 6 lakh rupee kharch ho gaye hai
 We will make an account of this and give it to the administration
 udhar, esadm sanjay sharma ne bataaya ki lila ke milane kii soochna sarkaar ko di jaaegi or jaanch ke baad vasuuli kii karrwai kii jaaegi
 Mental balance is lost, Lilais terrible accident has made Lila mentally weak, now she does not speak but just smiles
 lila ko milane ke liye ve log bhi aa rahe hai jinhone is traasadee main apano ko khoyaa he
 These people also showed Leela photographs of their family members so that perhaps any of them could identify Leela, but Leela could not identify anyone
 lila ko khojane main vijender ne din raat ek kar die
 Vijender shot the corner of the mountains with the photo of Leela for 18 months
 ant main vijender kii jeet hui or unhen apni lila mil hi gai
 Vijender Singh says that after that tragedy the number of people going mad in Uttarakhand has increased
 zyaadaatar aise hai jo sadame se pagal hue hai
 If the government gets a photo of all such mentally ill published in newspapers, then their family members may recognize them and they too reach their home

 - King Mika Singh (@mikasingh) February 4, 2015 philhalabihar ke siyaasi halatahi vah factor hai, jo bijepi ke liye dilli main miledard kaa marahamsabit ho rahaa he
 BJP is fully enjoying Manjhi and Nitish's quarrel
 uski koshish he ki is jhagade kaa use jitna bhi phayda mil sake, le le
 In this game of Bihar, the BJP is the only party that has the chance
 pehla mauka: bijepi ko to bas isi baat kaa intjaar he ki maanjhi or nitish main se koi bhi vidhansabha main bahumat sabit na kar paae
 In such a state, President's rule will be imposed which will be most beneficial for BJP
 doosraa mauka: maanjhi jediu ko jitna zyada nuksaan pahunchaa saken, bijepi ko phayda hoga
 BJP wants the game to reach its climax
 vaise bijepi kaa ek dhada maanjhi ke paksh main vot dekar sarkaar ko baahar se saport dene kii vakaalat kar rahaa he
 BJP leaders are openly saying that this option is open to them
 teesraa mauka: maanjhi ke bahumat na sabit kar paane kii sthiti main bijepi is ranneeti par vichaar kar rahi he ki unhen apni alag party banane ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae
 If Manjhi forms his own party, BJP will not have to come forward openly
 bijepi savarnon ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahati
 Who do not like Manjhi
 chauthaa mauka: is puure ghatnakram main sabase zyada dabaav main hai nitish kumaar
 BJP will want these conditions to remain the same so that Nitish can make mistakes on mistakes
 chaahe bayanon ke jariye yaa phir apane nirnyon se
 So that there will be a chance to capitalize on those mistakes as an issue in elections
 paanchavaa mauka: maanjhi ko vidhansabha main samarthan dekar bade nuksaan ke bajaae bijepi chote nuksaan ko zyada tavajjo degi
 The small loss for the BJP is to let Nitish Kumar form the government and take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor in elections
 vaise bijepi ko ye raas bhi khub aata he
 Past elections are witness to this fact

 After the result, the competition of joining the BJP, the days of BJP, which have been struggling for their existence in the politics of West Bengal, have suddenly become very different
 loksabhaa chunaav main siton kii sankhya or vot share ke maamle main sattadhari tiemasi ke baad pradesh main duusari sabase badi party banakar ubhari bijepi main shaamil hone waalon kaa tantaa sa laga hua he
 mlas, councilors and activists of TMC, Congress and other parties have been continuously joining BJP since the announcement of the election results
 darjeeling main majboot rahi he bijepipaschim bengal main bijepi ko milane vaali ekmaatr sansadeey seat hua karata tha darjeeling
 Jaswant Singh, who was the External Affairs and Finance Minister in the Vajpayee government, has represented this seat in the Lok Sabha
 narendra modi kii pichhali sarkaar main mantri rahe eses ahaluwalia bhi darjeeling se hi saansad the
 Right from the support of Gorkha Jan Mukti Morcha, which came into existence with the demand of Gorkhaland, the BJP has been strong in the Darjeeling hill region
 aise main vahaan pehle se hi kamjor tiemasi ke netaaon kaa bijepi main shaamil hona sattadhari dal kii qamar todane vaala bataaya ja rahaa he

 Sources said the additional agreement was approved last week and its information has been conveyed to the IAEA based in Vienna, which monitors nuclear activities internationally

 "in September 2008, as Foreign Minister, Mukherjee pledged to the NSG on behalf of the government that nuclear energy would be used peacefully and that this was important for the relaxation given to India
" bharat ne july, 2005 main bharat-america ke kriyanvayan ke sambandh main sanyukt bayaan ke tahat july, 2008 main ieie ko bheje apane sandesh main kaha tha ki vah ieie ke saath apni asainya parmaanu pariyojnaon ke sambandh main ghoshnaa patr jari karegaa or apni asainya parmaanu suvidhaon ko ieie ke suraksha maanakon ke tahat laaegaa

 upi nagar nikaay chunaav main bijepi ko prachand vijay mili he
 BJP has won 14 out of the 16 municipal corporations of UP
 jabaki congress or sapa kaa khaataa bhi nagar nigam main nahin khulaa he

 upi ke nikaay chunaav main is jeet se bijepi utsahit he
 It is now being claimed that the BJP will get the benefit of this victory in the Gujarat elections

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has been active for the last few months to surround the BJP in its fortress Gujarat
 rahul gujarat kii siyaasi jang jeetne ke liye rajya ke yuva trimurti ko bhi gale lagaaya he
 Due to Congress strategy, sweat was clearly visible on bjp's forehead

 com / ktwjr0xr7n a Union Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been convened today to fix the date of the first session of the 16th Lok Sabha
 baithak main yah tay kiya jayega ki sansad kaa aglaa satr kab se shuru kiya jaae
 It is speculated that the Parliament session may start from the first week of June
 vahiin mangalvaar ko narendra modi sarkaar kii pehali cabinet baithak hui
 An important decision was taken in this meeting regarding black money
 vaade ke mutabik modi sarkaar ne is maamle main esaiti banane kaa elaan kar diya he
 The first session of the newly formed Lok Sabha is expected to be convened in the first week of June and its dates are expected to be finalized in the cabinet meeting today
 nae vidhi evam nyaay mantri ravishankar prasad ne mangalvaar ko cabinet kii pehali baithak ke baad kaha ki pradhanmantri ne apni sarkaar ke pehle din hi puure josh se kaam shuru kar diya he
 "there is a second meeting on Wednesday, in which various issues including the budget session of Parliament will be discussed," he told reporters
 satr ke agle maheene ke pehle saptaah main aahut hone kii sambhaavna he, jisamen loksabhaadhyaksh kaa chunaav hoga or nae sadasyon ko shapath dilaai jaaegi
 Then after a gap, the second phase will present the General Budget and the Railway Budget
 purvavarti upie sarkaar ne farvari main 2014-15 ke liye antarim bajet pesh kiya tha, jisamen is maheene ke ant tak ke kharch kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 The head of the 'art of Living' organization, Mr
 Ravi Shankar, has created a nationwide uproar over the Syrian statement on the Ayodhya issue
 mangalvaar ko shri shri ravishankar ne bareli main ittehad-e-millat council ke rashtriya adhyaksh moulana tawqir raja khan ke saath baat kii
 On this occasion, Sri Sri said that his statement has been misrepresented and the seriawala twist is a given twist of the media
 shri shri ne ye bhi kaha ki wo ayodhya mudde kaa samaadhaan dhundne ko lekar puri tarah aashwast hai
 At the same time, Tauqeer Raza said that the conversation with Sri Sri took place in a very cordial atmosphere and he thinks that a solution will definitely be found
 bareli main shri shri ravishankar or tawqir raja gale milte bhi dikhe
 However, All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi has consistently taken a strong stand regarding Ravi Shankar's statement
 ovaisi ne mangalvaar ko dilli main kaha ki ve supreme court se apil karte hai ki ayodhya maamle kii sunwaayee 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad kii jaae kyonki is mudde kaa raajnneetikaran kiya ja rahaa he
 According to Owaisi, if the matter is heard after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then there will be no difference
 ovaisi ne kaha ki kyon koi un par ungali nahin uthaata jo bharat ke syria ban jane kii dhamkiyaan de rahe he
 Such statements give those who do not believe in the Indian Constitution or the Supreme Court
 ovaisi ne khud ko dhamkiyaan milane kii baat bhi kahi
 In a conversation with 'aaj Tak' in Bareilly, Maulana Tauqeer Raza, Head of etihad-e-millat, said that Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is working in the spirit of patriotism
 achchhai ke liye jo bhi kaam kare, uskaa saath achchhai main yakeen rakhane vaale logon ko bhi dena chahie
 Tauqir Raza said, 'as far as i understand his point, it is that the decision from the court will be a matter of happiness for one party and a matter of sorrow for the other party
 ek shaury diwas manayega to doosraa kaala diwas manayega
 If such an environment is created, then the situation of the country is in danger of deteriorating
 hona ye chahie ki court ke faisle se pehle hi insaaniyat ke naate donon pakshon ko baatcheet ke liye raji karne kii koshish kii jaae
 If the conversation can be held out of court, then it should be tried
 agar kisi nattejey par pahunchane main kamyaabi milti he to isse acchhee koi baat nahin
 If this is not done, then let it be run as it is, that is, wait for the court's decision
 ’tawqir raja ne saath hi jor dekar kaha ki insaaniyat ke naate hamaari or shri shri ravishankar kii nahin, tamaam logon kii jimmedaari honi chahie ki kisi bhi surat main is maamle ko lekar dange fasaad kaa maahaul naa banane den
 Tauqir Raza said that all those who believe in unity and brotherhood in India, believe in secularism, come forward for this work
 jab tawqir raja se yah poocha gaya ki aakhirkaar maamle kaa samaadhaan kya he to unhone kaha, 'samaadhaan maine bataaya ki donon pakshon ko ham koshish karenge ki ek baar saath bithaaya jaae
 If an agreement can be formed on the basis of the conditions of both, then it should be tried
 nirmohi akhaada waalon se bhi baat hui he
 In the case of a Vishwa Hindu Parishad, we feel that in any case, he would not like the case to be decided in the Out of Court
 aise hi kuch log hamaari taraf bhi hai
 Vishwa Hindu Parishad says that if our faith is big, then faith is also ours
 hamaari bhi aasthaa bahut badi he kisi se kam nahin he
 But it is not appropriate to riot in the name of faith
 yah kaam jo bhi kar rahaa he yaa jo karnaa chahta he vah apane desh se pyaar nahin karata he
 He is a traitor to the country
 hamen hindu muslim ekta ke liye kaam karnaa chahie
 For this, we are ready to give whatever sacrifice we have to give
 ’tawqir raja ne kaha, ‘shri shri ravishankar kii jo log mukhaalafat kar rahe hai, main samajhataa hum ki wo thik log nahin he
 If people like Sri Sri Ravi Shankar are in India, then i believe that there is still humanity in India
 tali donon haathon se bajati he, haath milaane kii jarurat he
 Today we and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar have joined hands
 koshish yahi rahegi ki jaldi ham donon pakshon ko bhi saath baitha saken or sahmati kii ore badhane ke liye unhen taiyaar karen
 Tauqeer Raza disagreed with Asaduddin Owaisi's statement that a case should be registered against Sri Sri Ravi Shankar for his statement on Syria
 tawqir raja ke mutabik musalamaanon ke haq ke naam par jo bhi un ko bhadakaane kaa kaam karata he wo meri najar main desh kaa dushman he
 Mr
 Sri Ravi Shankar, the head of the Art of Living, who advocated an out-of-court settlement of the Ayodhya dispute, said on Monday that the country would become Syria if the matter is not resolved
 unhone kaha tha, 'ayodhya muslimon kaa dharmik sthal nahin he
 They should leave their claim at this religious place and set an example
 agar faisla court se hoga to kisi ek paksh ko haar sweekaar kerani padegi
 In such a situation, the loser will still accept, but after some time, a ruckus will start again
 jo samaaj ke liye acha nahin hoga

 Understand 5 things, how much benefit the Congress faces this time apart from BJP-SAD as well as AAP
 BJP-SAD ko 2012 main 42 fisadi vot mili the, jabaki congress ko 40 fisadi
 Now, if the Congress still maintains at least this same vote share and gets 6% of PPP in it, then it can get an edge
 lekin aam aadmi party kaa vot share loksabhaa chunaav main teesraa sabase zyada 24 fisadi tha
 That is, AAP will cut the votes of both Congress and BJP

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was stepping down from the stage after completing his speech at the convocation ceremony of Banaras Hindu University on Monday when a student voiced him and demanded a student union election
 ashutosh singh naam ke is chaatr ke aisa karte hi police ne use dhar liya or baahar le jane lagi tabhi kathith bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ne uski pitayee kar di
 It is worth mentioning that last month, even when PM Modi was giving a speech at Ambedkar University in Lucknow, the protesters had caused disruption in the program by raising slogans
 baad main un pradarshnakariyon ko hiraasat main lekar police ne unase sawaal jawaab kiya tha
 It is being told that the BJP was a little worried about this BHU arrival of PM Modi due to the controversy of JNU students

 These included Left-backed organizations that are demanding the release of JNU student Kanhaiya Kumar

 lekin, kya karen sansad main kuch logon main sasti lokapriyata batorne kii hode, 24 ghante news channelon kii khabar bechney kii maansikta ne kai baar us baat ko bhi mudda bana diya jis ore aapkaa dhyaan bhi nahin jaataa
 Arvind Kejriwal's difficulties are not being named
 pichley dinon kaaphi charchit rahe dilli sarkaar ke lok nirmaan vibhaag main shuukravaar ko ek bade farjivade kaa khulaasa hua
 This scam of crores in PWD has happened in the name of construction and maintenance
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki dilli main sadak or naalon ke theke kii oot main sarkari khajaane kii khuli lut hui he
 Millions have been paid to contractors without bills
 dilli ke har jone main bilon ke bhugtan main karodon kaa ghotaalaa hua he
 This whole game is going on under the nose of PWD Minister Satyendra Jain
 'ajtak' ke paas maujuud sabooton ke mutabik dilli sarkaar ke nirmaan vibhaag main ghotaalon kaa gorakhdhandha chal rahaa he or isamen upar se lekar neeche tak har adhikari shaamil hai
 According to these records, PWD department of Delhi government paid the rupees in 198 places of Delhi without bills
 or jin bill ke aadhaar par thekedaaron ko karodon rupee baant diye gayi unka koi record nirmaan vibhaag ke paas he hi nahin
 According to sources, the reality is that without doing construction or repair work, contractors in different areas of Delhi kept paying crores of rupees by paying fake bills and the department kept silently watching
 yahaan tak ki jin logon ko karodon kaa bhugtan sarkaar ne kar diya unhone asaliyat main kaam karaayaa hi nahin
 Documents present with 'aaj Tak' show how in the year 2014-15, as a minister of Satyendra Jain, the work of repairing and cleaning all the roads and drains of Delhi was given to many contractors whose record of payment was neither The PWD department is neither with the government's sales tax department nor with the contractor itself
 dilli sarkaar ke peedblyoody vibhaag ne kaise bagaiyr bilon or niyam kaayade ke sarkari thekon ko paas kar diya iskaa khulaasa hua he nirmaan vibhaag ke artiai jawaab se
 In fact, the construction and repair of roads and drains under the Delhi Government is vested with the PWD Department of the Delhi Government
 jiske liye thekedaaron ko tay niyamon ke tahat kaam karne ko kaha jaataa he or kaam puraa hone ke baad jaanch or bilon ke aadhaar par puraa bhugtan kiya jaataa he
 However, the officials started a conspiracy with the contractors that the bills were paid in full without any bills
 jab artiai ke tahat jawaab maanga gaya to jawaab mila ki hamaare paas bhugtan kiye bills kaa koi record he hi nahin
 Due to this fraud, scams were scammed in Delhi at not one or two but hundreds places and the government treasuries were defrauded of about 200 crores
 jaankaree ke mutabik peedblyoody vibhaag ke ejiniers ne apni sajeesh ko anjaam dene ke liye dilli kii un-un jagahon par marammat or rakh-rakhaav kaa kaam theke par diya jahaan yaa to iskaa jarurat hi nahin thi yaa phir un jagahon ko dekhakar pahchaan karnaa mushkil tha ki aakhir koi nirmaan kaary hua he yaa phir nahin
 'aajtak' has a list of the works of the Delhi government, which has been clearly seen that the places where work has been shown is indeed very suspicious and it is difficult to say what has been done
 isse bhi zyada hairaani kii baat ye he ki dilli sarkaar ne jin thekedaaron ko kaam karaane kaa jimmaa diya unhone theke paane ke liye tay kharch se 60 se 70 pratishat kam tak main kaam karaane kaa daawa thonk diya yani ki jis kaam ke liye quality ke niyamon ke mutabik sarkaar ke paas 100 rupee kaa bajet tha use thekedaaron ne 30-40 rupayon me hi karne kii hami bhar di, jo ki sambhav hi nahin tha
 The motive is clear, there is apprehension that the contract for getting the work done at less than half the cost is not actually done and for this no material construction material has been procured and sold
 The government also paid the bills to the contractors
 aaie ab daalate hai kuch aise hi kaamon par
 
 
 Case-1 place-eganu Road, Purana Mehrauli Badarpur Road, Firani Road to improve kama-nalla and RMC Construction work-rs 3,26,26,450 thaheka-varun Gupta and Company contractor-varun Gupta in 2014-15, Delhi's Iganu Road, Purana Mehrauli Road and a contract was awarded for the repair and construction of the drains of Firni Road
 aaropon ke mutabik in jagahon par koi kaary hi nahin hua
 When RTI was asked for information about payments, receipts and records of work done at these places, the reply received was astonishing
 peedblyoody ne jawaab diya- hamane aisa koi record nahi rakhaa he kyonki qaraar ke mutabik aisa koi ricard rakhana jaruri nahin he
 When the 'aajtak' team visited these places, it was found that there is no open drain on Mehrauli Road
 uske baad team mehrauli ke paas kii hi ek or site par dekhne pahunchi
 The repair and maintenance of the drain was done on this road, but the reality of repair and construction of the drain on the Eganu road was something else
 iske baad 'ajtak' kii team ne is kaam ko karaane vaali company kii taraf rukh kiya

 When we questioned him, excuses were given for ten ways
 lekin is baat kaa koi jawaab nahin diya gaya ki aakhir wo records kahaan hai jinke aadhaar par sarkaar se lagbhag 3 karod rupee kaa penmet mila
 Well the record was not to be found and there were many excuses
 lekin, artiai main peedblyoody vibhaag ke jawaab ne pehle hi saaf kar diya ki jis kaam ke liye karodon kaa bhugtan kiya gaya uskaa koi record hi nahin he
 After coming back to power in 2014, the Aam Aadmi Party took the initiative to repair the streets and drains of Delhi and the head of the department responsible for this was senior leader and minister Satyendar Jain
 vahi satyendra jain jinaki manamaani or kanoon ko taak par rakhane ke maamle ek-ek kar baahar aa rahe hai
 According to the evidence, engineers and contractors of the department of Satyendra Jain took the responsibility of repairing about 200 roads and drains in Delhi, most of which are difficult to identify and details of work
 dastavejon par kaam kii detail kuch is tarah se likhi hai ki jise vastav main dhundhna mumkin hi nahin he
 Satyendra Jainke Public Works Department gave the task of repairing sewer and roads in every corner of Delhi to different contractors, but it is amazing that in the name of work everywhere, only scam was done
 aisa ham nahin balki peedblyoody vibhaag ke kagajaat khud ishaara kar rahe hai
 Case - 2 places - Delhi's Kalkaji, Rampura Main Road and Pratap Nagar Road - Cost of improvement of sewer and construction of pavement-rs

 thaka-new Bharat Construction Company contractor-mukhtar Ahmed When the work was investigated in these places Even this could not be verified
 koi namonishaan aisa nahin mila jisase pataa chale ki siver ke sudhaar or nirmaan kaa koi kaam in jagahon par kiya gaya he
 That means the work was clear here, only on paper
 lihaaja ajtak kii team ne kaagajon ko jaanchana thik samajha
 According to the evidence given in response to the RTI of Delhi's NGO Rocko ie 'road Anti Corruption Organization', according to the documents submitted by the PWD department, the contract was purchased by the New India Construction Company for the work from which the places were Vinayak Sales and Karthik Trading which are both Delhi-based companies
 mukhtaar ahamed kii company new bharat consatruction ke mutabik nirmaan or marammat karne ke liye jo saamaan kharida wo inhen jagahon se kharida
 Whose bills were duly submitted to the PWD department
 lekin jab in material saplyrs se poocha gaya to vinayak cells ne bataaya ki unhone kabhi koi bhi bijness dling new bharat company se kii hi nahin
 He also gave the outstanding written document of this matter
 iske alaava yah baat bhi saamne ai ki karthik trading company naam kii koi company he hi nahin
 This was confirmed by the Sales Tax Department in writing
 baavjood iskepeedblyoody vibhaagane is kaam kaa puraa bhugtan yani kareeb 4 karod rupee bagaiyr kisi jaanch ke de diya
 The reason was simple, the work for which the department was looting crores of rupees for sewer and construction was not actually done
 agar artiai ke jawaab main peedblyoody vibhaag kii daleelon or javaabon kii baat karen to har theke me sirf kagaji kile banaaye gayi hai
 In Delhi's sewer and construction work, not only contracts were awarded by keeping all the rules in mind, but in making payment, the limits of breaking the law were crossed
 kareeb aadha darjan kaamon main artiai ke jawaab or hamaari jaanch main paaya gaya ki yaa to koi kaam hua hi nahin or farji bill par bhugtan liya gaya he yaa phir agar kahin kaam kiya gaya he to itane ghatiya darje kaa jiske evaj main bhugtan peedblyoody vibhaag kii mileebhagat kii ore saaf ishaara karata he

 At 8 am in the morning, the ahmednagar-manmad highway in Shirdi was running at full speed
 lekin tabhi logon kii najar ek hotel ke baahar padi laash par padi
 On the upper side, this corpse, less corpse and a sleeping person seemed more
 lekin isi soe hue insaan ko jagaane kii koshish hui to ek daraavna sach saamne aayaa
 Even after a lot of effort, when there was no movement in the man and he saw blood leaking from under the sheet, then it became clear that this man is not alive and is not a minor death, but a murder
 abhi police is laash ko baraamad kar kaatil kaa pataa dhund paati, isse pehle hi ek or khabar ne use ek nae thikaane ke liye ravaanaa hone par majaboor kar diya
 And this place was not far from this first chance-a-crime
 subah ke kareeb 8
 It was 30 o'clock and the police got the news of another corpse lying near the government guest house on the city-manmad highway, near the site of the first corpse
 ye laash sadak se thodi duuri par ek dukaan ke shater ke saath padi thi
 Just like today, when the shopkeeper reached the shop in connection with his work, seeing the dead body outside the shutter, his footsteps stopped
 lekin ajeeb baat yah thi ki yah laash bhi pehali vaali laash kii tarah hi chadar se thik aise dhaki thi, jaise koi aadmi so rahaa ho
 But here too, the blood spilled around the sheet was witness to the murder of this human being
 tabhi ek or vaardaat kii khabar ne police ko bhi chaunkaa diya
 It was a quarter to nine in the morning and another corpse was found near the Gyaneshwar temple, a short distance from the second incident

 On receiving this news, the police immediately rushed to the new hideout
 police ne dekha ki yahaan kaa manjar bhi pehle kii do vaardaaton se hu-ba-hu miltaa-julata tha
 There was a sheet-covered corpse lying near the fields, a little away from the temple
 is laash ko dekhakar lagata tha ki pehle do laashon kii tarah isaki bhi kisi baari cheez se kuchalakar jaan lee gai he
 It was now clear that these corpses had some relation with each other
 kyonki ek taraf jahaan sabhi kii sabhi laashen chaadaron se dhaki mili, vahiin duusari taraf sabhi laashon ke paas baari pathar yaa inten bhi padi milin
 In such a situation, these dead bodies lying at a distance of a few kilometers and a few minutes, could not be coincidental

 Peacock feathers have special significance in Hinduism

 There is a story related to why this happens in our religious texts
 bhagwaan shiv ne maa parvati ko pakshi shaastra main varnit mor ke mahatv ke bare main bataaya he
 In ancient times, there was an asura named Sandhya
 vah bahut shaktishaalee or tapasvi asur tha
 Sandhya became an enemy of the gods due to Guru Shukracharya
 sandhya asur ne kathor tap kar shivaji or brahma ko prasann kar liya tha
 When Brahma and Shiva were pleased, Asura gained many powers as a boon
 shaktiyon ke kaaran sandhya bahut shaktishaalee ho gaya tha
 The powerful evening had started harassing the devotees of Lord Vishnu
 asur ne swarg par bhi aadhipaty kar liya tha, devataaon ko bandi bana liya tha
 When somehow the gods were not able to conquer Sandhya, they made a plan
 yojana ke anusaar, sabhi devtaa or sabhi nau grah ek mor ke pankhons main virajit ho gaye
 Now that peacock had become very powerful
 mor ne vishaal rup dhaaran kiya or sandhya asur kaa vadh kar diya
 Since then, peacocks also came to be regarded as sacred and sacred

 Aaron, who has faced career ups and downs since his international debut in October 2011, has no trouble accepting that the time has come for him to consistently perform well
 mohali main guuruuvaar se shuru ho rahe pehle test se purv aaron ne kaha, 'main dakshin africa siries ko lekar kaaphi utsuk hum
 i played just one Test in Sri Lanka and it was not a good match
 main us match main sirf do wicket hasil kar paaya
 i have been bowling well (in Ranji Trophy) for some time and i have done well against bangladesh-a
 ab samay aa gaya he ki main sudhaar karun
 ' jharkhand kaa yah tej gendbaaj ab tak vanade maichon ke liye chayankartaaon ko prabhavit nahin kar paaya he, lekin pichhali chaar siries se test team kaa hissaa he
 Ishant Sharma will not be able to play in the first Test in Mohali due to a one-match ban and Aaron may get a chance in the final 11
 vaise bhi aaron ko kohli kaa samarthan hasil he jo line or length se gendbaaji karne vaale gendbaajon kii tulana main unki atirikt gati ko adhik praathamikta dete hai
 Aaron said, 'it is always great to have the support of the captain
 lekin aisa sirf mere saath nahin he, viraat ko team main shaamil prayek sadsy par bharosa he
 When the captain supports you, you always feel good and hope that you will be able to live up to their confidence against South Africa
 ' Bowling batsmen like Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers will be a challenge, but Aaron is focusing on his formulation instead
 unhone kaha, 'eemaandaaree se kahuun to main kisi vishesh cheez par kaam nahin kar rahaa
 Instead of focusing on who i am bowling, i am focusing on keeping the basics right
 jo mere niyantran main hai agar main use sahi kar paaya to mujhe pataa he ki main team ke liye yogadan de paaunga
 Continuity in performance is important in international cricket and i am constantly working on it
 'tippaniyan Aaron has only played seven Tests and nine odis in four years so far due to lack of consistency in performance and recurring back pain
 ab haalanki aisa lagata he ki ve fitness kii chunauti se paar paane main safal rahe hai
 He said, 'yes, i have been successful in injury free
 sabase pehle to yah aayu ke kaaran he
 My bones are now more mature and this is the reason why i no longer have stress fractures
 maine hameshaa kadi training kii he or ab bhi karata hum lekin ab antar yah he ki main apane sharir ko adhik aaraam de saktaa hum
 It has helped me a lot

 ' Before the first Test in Mohali starting on Thursday, Aaron said, 'I am very keen on the South Africa series
 maine srilanka main sirf ek test khelaa tha or yah kaaphi acha match nahin rahaa
 i managed to get just two wickets in that match
 main pichley kuch samay se acchhee gendbaaji (ranjai trophy main) kar rahaa hum or bangladesh-e ke khilaaf maine acha pradarshan kiya
 Now it's time for me to improve
 ' The Jharkhand fast bowler has not been able to impress the selectors for the ODI matches so far, but is a part of the Test team from the last four series
 ek match ke pratibandh ke kaaran ishanth sharma mohali main pehle test main nahin khel paaenge or aise main aaron ko antim 11 main mauka mil saktaa he
 As such, Aaron has the backing of Kohli, who prefers his extra speed over bowlers bowling from the line and length
 aaron ne kaha, 'captain kaa samarthan milanaa hameshaa shandaar hota he
 But it's not just me, Virat has faith in every member of the team

 He said, 'to be honest, i am not working on any particular thing
 main kise gendbaaji kar rahaa hum is par dhyaan lagane kii jagah main basic sahi rakhane par dhyaan laga rahaa hum

 There is a stir of Modi everywhere

 You may remember that Modi did tremendous election campaigning through 3D holographic technology
 ek hi jatke main unhone naa sirf kai jagah apana sandesh pahunchaa diya balki iske jariye unhone yuvaaon ko bhi apana mureed banaaya
 In such a situation, even today, through 3D holographic technology, Ahmedabad was tried to land in Delhi
 is takanic ke jariye modi ke parivaar ke kai sadasyon se baatcheet kii
 Modi has four brothers (somabhai Modi, Amrit Modi, Pankaj Modi, Prahlad Modi) and a sister (vansati Ben)
 aaj tak ke saath 3 di holographic takanic se amrit modi or unke bete sanjay modi ne baat kii
 Modi's elder brother Amrit Modi said that like Delhi, the weather in Ahmedabad is also 'hot'

 He has done a lot of work in Gujarat

 Never been stubborn chote samaaj kaa baccha desh kaa piem ban rahaa he ye kam badi baat nahin he
 We ask Modi how are you on the phone
 unki samaj ke baraabar to hamaari samaj nahin he isliye desh ke muddon par to unase vichaar-vimarsh nahin hota he
 Modi does what he thinks
 'sanjay modi kii patni kumud or beti niraali ne bhi aaj tak ke saath 3 di holographic takanic se baat kii
 Modi's granddaughter Nirali said, 'I am happy
 jab dada piem banenge tab se achche din shuru ho jaaenge
 Dada (narendra Modi) gives less time to the family
 ''kumud ne kaha, 'ab puraa hindustan modi kaa parivaar hone vaala he
 The family has never had any complaint with Modi for giving less time

 What the voters denied to the BJP, now the Sangh is also trying to find fault with the BJP
 apane mukhpatr organizer main sangh ne party alaakaman ko jamkar kharikhoti sunai he
 The Sangh has said that the decision taken in the AC rooms, led to the party relying on high-tech publicity
 bijepi kii bolti band he
 The RSS has bluntly written in an editorial in its mouthpiece Organizer that the party was not harmed by the ideology
 party ko varun gandhi-narendra modi kii bayaanbaji se bhi nuksaan nahin hua he
 The reality is that BJP could not sense the mood of the public
 sanghathan kii kamajoriyaan or hai tech prachaar par bharosa party ko le duba
 Because politics is done on the ground and not by sitting in AC rooms
 bijepi apane daravaaje un sabhi ke liye band kar de jo use congress kii bi team banane kii koshish karen
 Now what should BJP do? bolti pehle se hi band he or sangh ne puure system par hi ungali uthaa di
 It is certain that the BJP will have to change its move, character and face, but in this storm of change, the war seems to start within the family first

 However, a 20 percent tax has been announced on imports from Mexico for this
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki iskaa kharch aakhirkaar kisapar aayega
 Those who export goods from Mexico or those who buy it in America
 kyonki kisi bhi tex kaa final boj kharidaar par hi padataa he
 Trump may also face opposition here in the US
 america sansad main aae prastaav main kaha gaya he ki america main aayaat se zyada niryaat karne vaale deshon par 20 fisadi aayaat kar lagaaya jaae
 This would increase opportunities for American companies to sell their goods
 trump america first kaa naaraa lagaataar dete rahe hai
 Under this, the Trump administration can impose a tax on goods coming to America, while American companies can get export exemption
 mexico par kya hoga asar?bhale hi trump prashasan ne elaan kiya ho ki diwaar kii laagat mexico se hone vaale aayaat par tex lagaakar kiya jayega lekin aakhirkaar iskaa boj america upabhoktaaon par hi pad saktaa he
 It may be recovered by the Mexican company, but ultimately the company will pass the burden on to American consumers
 doosraa sawaal ye bhi uthta he ki kya mexico se hone vaale aayaat par tex lagaakar diwaar kaa puraa kharch vasula ja sakegaa
 It is estimated that this huge wall project could cost up to $ 15 billion
 mexico se hone vaale vyapaar par tex lagaakar ise vasuulne main vakt lag saktaa he
 Mexico's position in US trade Mexico's neighboring country Mexico is the second largest country in terms of importing goods there
 pehle sthaan par china he
 Any interruption in trade between the US and Mexico will affect the rest of the countries as well
 tex chhot ko lekar america niryaatak bhale hi iske paksh main philhal dikh rahe hai lekin export bataate hai ki isse aakhirkaar america logon ke liye naukariyon ke avasar ghatenge hi
 How legal is this decision? America's decision to increase the tax burden on neighboring countries may face opposition in North America Free Trade agreement-nafta and World Trade organization-wto
 ye sanghathan mukt vyapaar ke paksh main or sangrakshanvaadi nitiyon ke khilaaf lagaataar aawaaj uthaate rahe hai
 Mexico will definitely raise its voice on these forums to protect itself
 baaki deshon ke utpaadon or sevaaon ke aayaat par bhi agar iskaa asar padataa he to virodh or bhi tej hoga
 These routes can also be adopted
 In addition to imports on goods coming from trump-mexico, the tax burden can be increased on the people of Mexico working in America
 chunavi abhiyaan main trump lagaataar isapar jor dete rahe hai
 - Through the change in American Patriot Tax, the tax can be increased on the money sent to Mexico
 america main rahane or kaam karne vaale mexican log har saal kareeb 25 billian dollar kii raashi bhejte hai
 Tax can be increased by raising tax on it
 -trump kehete rahe hai ki agar mexico america ko 5 se 10 billian dollar kii raashi dene par sahamat ho to isapar chhot di ja sakati he

 It was only here that he started building glass houses inside the sea

 Even the dream of making crores of people a millionaire, but he did not let anyone's dreams take flight
 cycle par gaanv-gaanv doodh bechney vaale nirmal singh bhangu ne shaayad sapane main bhi nahin sochaa hoga ki do dashak ke bheetar wo hindustan ke sabase bade bhu-swami yani land bank kaa maalik banegaa
 Perhaps none of the fortunes of Champaur in Pajamb had shone like this before
 rolls royas or bendle jaisi beshkeemtee gaadiyaan or gulf stream jaise privet jetts shaayad bhangu ke liye koi myne nahin rakhte
 Because their world of unmatched wealth extends from Amritsar to Australia

 In India, the book of his land is so much that if these lands are placed on the map, then a city like Bangalore will become smaller

 Sebi questioned Bhango's wealth of trillions of rupees and said that the Pearl Group collected forty five thousand crore rupees from the gullible five crore investors of the country through the capital scheme of becoming rich overnight

 Apart from the CBI, the Corporate Affairs Ministry has also started an investigation into the spreading business of Bhango

 aapako jaanakar hairat hogi ki 45 hajaar karod rupee ke ghapale ke babajood parl group ab bhi bhole-bhaale niveshkon se alag-alag lubhaavni skiimon ke naam par rakam bator rahaa he
 45 thousand crore rupees state, even many countries will not have this much annual budget

 It is also reported that the CBI has seized the passport of Bhangu and questioned him for hours, but the ground reality is that the business of Bhangu's pongy scheme is continuing
 karodpati banaae nahin jate, banate hai
 But Nirmal Singh Bhangu had woven such a web of dreams in the name of business that people easily got entangled in his trap
 jaahir he uske nishane par khaas taur par wo garib or majaboor log the jo aasaani se amir bananaa chaahate the or isi insaani kamajori kaa bhangu ne bharpoor phayda uthaaya
