 ) dilli ke trinagar vidhansabha kshetra se bijepi vidhayak doctor nandakishor garg ko dhamkee milane kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 Doctor Nandkishore and his family have received death penalty for demanding Rs 25 lakh and not receiving money

 How safe is the capital Delhi and the fear of law and police in the hearts of the criminals, it can be gauged from this that the criminals are now openly threatening the mlas of the area elected by the public
 or jaan salaamati ke badale phiroti maangane lage hai
 The miscreants have not only threatened MLA Dr Nandkishore Garg but have also threatened several other family members by calling him
 vidhayak garg ke mutabik 26 may ko jahaan puraa desh pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh par nazren gadaaye hue tha, vahiin doctor garg bhi is samaaroh main shaamil hone raashtrapati bhawan pahunche hue the
 He received a threatening call in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, which was picked up by Dr
 Garg's PSO and later he narrated the entire incident to MLA Garg
 dhamkee dene vaale vyakti ne khud kaa naam niraj bataaya or pieso se kaha ki ab achche din aa gaye hai or garg sahib ko kahie 25 lakh rupee bhej den varanaa acha nahin hoga
 But MLA Garg did not take it seriously and ignored it as a joke
 samasya gambhir tab ho gai jab vidhayak garg ke parivaar ke anya sadasyon ke phone par bhi dhamkiyaan milane lageen, iske baad vidhayak garg ne police ko soochna di
 The matter was related to the MLA of the area, so the police also did not take care and immediately took action and traced the number
 police ko pataa chalaa ki phone kol karne vaale vyakti kaa number kisi pandey naam ke aadmi kaa tha par wo bhi kaaphi dinon pehle chori ho chukaa tha
 MLA Garg also says that the number from which the call came on his phone, the same number received threats on the phone of other members of his house
 isse vidhayak garg bhi hairaan hai ki unka number to saarvajanik he par gharavaalon kaa number us phiroti maangane vaale ke paas kaise pahunch gaya
 According to MLA Garg, he has no enmity with anyone and he has also denied the possibility of suspecting anyone
 philhal ab ye maamla police ke paas he or police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he, par sawaal ye uthta he ki jab janata dwaara chune gaye janpratinidhi ke saath is tarah bekhauf hokar apradhi phiroti kii demand kar rahe hai to phir janata bechaari kaise surakshit rahegi

 There has been an uproar over India's visa to former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad
 shivasena ke netaa sanjay raut ne kaha he ki javed miyandad ko vija dekar sarkaar daaud ibrahim kii madad kar rahi he
 On the other hand, Congress leader Jagdambika Pal has also said that giving visa to Javed Miandad is wrong and doing so will hurt the sentiments of the people of India

 bahes ke dauraan vipaksh ne joardaar hangaamaa bhi kiya
 The government claims that our Lokpal bill is strong
 sarkaar kaa kahana he ki lokapal kaa chunaav nishpaksh tareeke se hi hoga

 com / wjmuw725iv — Ranveer Singh (@ranveerofficial) February 11, 2019 Ranveer Singh arrived to receive the Dubai Award
 samaaroh main apane spich ke dauraan ranvir singh ne desh ke shaheedon ko yaad kiya or maun rakhane apil kii
 Ranveer said, "my thoughts and prayers are with the martyrs of the country, who have lost their lives for the country
" desh ke jawan hi asli hero hai
 i urge everyone present here to come together and keep a minute's silence for the martyrs of the country
 gauratlab he ki pulavama main 14 farvari ko siarpief javaanon kaa ek kafila ja rahaa tha
 During this time, the explosive-laden vehicle crashed into the jawans' vehicle and caused a sharp explosion
 hamale main 40 jawan shahid ho gaye or kai ghayal bhi hue
 This terrorist attack is being described as the most attack ever
 isse pehle bhi 2016 main uri main aatanki atake hua tha jisamen kai jawan shahid ho gaye the
 "you started the political journey from Dwarka Nagri and Somnath (gujarat), then went to Kashi Vishwanath's city (varanasi), we will be lucky if you fight the next election from Mahaprabhu Jagannath's city Puri
 " uttar pradesh main aitihaasik chunavi jeet ke baad bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main hissaa lene pradhanmantri narendra modi 15 april ko bhubaneshwar pahunche, to odisha ikai ke netaaon ne yah prastaav rakhaa
 Modi, confident, merely smiled at the proposal
 is par netaaon ne kaha ki agar aap nahin to rashtriya adhyaksh amit shahji ko bhej den
 The South Eastern coastal region of the Indian peninsula, known as the Coromandel, is the most important in the 2019 strategy of the BJP
 isliye odisha kii bhaajapa ikai kaa yah prastaav myne rakhata he kyonki rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad shah ne jab sadsyta abhiyaan chalaaya to khud isi soobe se sakriy sadsy bane
 Shah's goal regarding Odisha is clear as the party has secured second position in the recent panchayat elections, weakening the Congress and the Biju Janata Dal
 shah kii ranneeti ke bare main party ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''shah kisi bhi keemat par odisha main bhagava sarkaar banane main jute chuke hai kyonki 2014 ke aam chunaav main modi lahar ke baavjood party ko 21 loksabhaa siton main se mahaj ek seat hi mil pai thi
 "the BJP has made Odisha a gate-way to increase its influence in odisha-koromandal region on Odisha Barasta Coromandel
 sanghathanaatmak or chunavi ankaganit main party kaa prabhaav in ilaakon main kamatar he, isliye chunaav se do saal pehle party ne ranneeti ke tahat odisha kii rajdhani bhubaneshwar ko rashtriya kaaryakarini (15-16 april) ke liye chunaa
 Recently, the Kesariya platoon has made a quantum jump in the panchayat elections and received 34 per cent of the votes, excluding the urban vote
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa ke mutabik, khud pradhanmantri panchayat chunaav ko notebandi ke baad kii pehali sweekaaryata maanate hai
 However, BJP also realizes its organizational weakness in Odisha, so to encourage the workers, the party started the organizational expansion from Bhubaneswar after the UP victory
 odisha ke tateey kshetra main bhaajapa kamjor he, jabaki pashchimi kshetra main paramparaagat gaiyr-congressi maahaul kii vajah se party majboot sthiti main he
 In the western region, first the Republic Council, then the Swatantra Party and later Biju Patnaik had influence, now the BJP is dominant in this region
 jabaki tateey kshetra main mukhyamantri naveen patnayak kii party biju janata dal majboot he
 The BJP sees possibilities of splitting the Biju Janata Dal in this area
 tateey kshetra samet odisha main party kaa prabhaav badhaane main kendriya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan khud ke vibhaag samet centre sarkaar kii vikaas kii yojanaon ko anjaam de rahe hai
 (see graphic) Prime Minister Modi has had four government visits in Odisha since 2014 and is basically playing an important role in realizing the political message through Odisha's flagship development agenda
 bhagava paracham lahraane kii sthiti main pradhan mukhyamantri pad ke prabal daavedaaron main se bhi maane jate hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has reached its peak in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, where now the scope for expansion is very less
 isliye coromandal or purvottar main saat rajya assam, odisha, pashchim bengal, andhra pradesh, telugana, karnataka or tamilnadu ab bhaajapa ke agenda par he
 Shah also expressed it in the executive's address, "the BJP reached its peak in 2014, the same was said in 2017
" lekin abhi bijepi kaa charmotkarsh baaki he
 Our resolve is that the BJP should be in every state from Panchayat to Parliament, only then will the golden era of BJP come
 " isi ranneeti ke tahat vistaarak yojana shuru kii he or 2,470 aise kaaryakarta chhante hai jo ek saal to 1,441 aise hai jo chah maah or 3 lakh 78 hajaar kaaryakarta 15 din kaa samay puri tarah se sanghathan ke liye denge
 The party contested 428 seats in 2014 of which 146 seats were lost
 haari hui siton main se party ne 125 loksabhaa siton par focus badhaayaa he, jinamein party ko sambhaavnaaen dikh rahi he or zyaadaatar inhen rajyon se aate hai
 Shah said in the presidential speech, "there was a perception about us that we win the Congress and lose in front of regional parties
 lekin upi ne is myth ko tod diya he
 "so as part of the strategy, the BJP has announced the next national executive in Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh on July 15-16 after Bhubaneshwar to increase its influence in the Coromandel region
 pichhadaa card kaa daanvupi main saamaajik sameekaran kaa bada or safal pintara aajamaa chuki bhaajapa ne bhubaneshwar kaaryakarini main pehali baar obisi ko lekar vishesh prastaav paas kiya, jisamen modi cabinet kii ore se pichhadaa varg ayog ko sanvaidhanik darja dene par vaahvahee luutane kii koshish hui to rajyasabha main bill atakane ke liye congress ko aade haathon liya
 The party said in the resolution that for 30 years, the Congress was seen as a vote bank by the backward class and did not take its demand seriously
 lekin modi sarkaar pichhadaa varg ko nyaay dilaane kii disha main aage bad rahi he
 However, there is also the pain of BJP behind this proposal because in the last few years there have been violent incidents in Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan where the party is under the rule, the demand for reservation in backward classes
 lekin is prastaav ke jariye party ne khud ko pichhadon kaa himachati hone kaa sandesh dene kii bharsak koshish kii he
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP got 12 per cent more than 38 per cent backward votes compared to 2009
 party apane vistaar kii yojana main is varg ko kader ke taur par jodpha chaahati he
 Under the Backward Card betting, the BJP is also making a strategy to add backward classes among Muslims
 pradhanmantri modi ne samaapan bhaashan main is par khaas jor diya, ''obisi ko apane saath jodate vakt hamen musalamaanon main pichde log jise pasmanda kehete hai unki samasyaon par dhyaan dekar apane saath jodpha chahie
 "even on triple talaq, Modi said that awareness should be spread to remove this evil practice
 party kii pichhadaa ranneeti main odisha or tatavarti kshetra bhi he
 Odisha has about 30 per cent backward classes
 iske alaava vahaan essi-asti 35 fisadi, alpsankhyak 5 fisadi or baaki anya samaaj ke log hai jabaki rajnatik prastaav main bhaajapa ne kaha he ki jis tarah garibi dur karne kaa mudda indira gandhi ke paas tha, ab vah bhaajapa ke paas he
 Prime Minister Modi also gave a mantra to the workers as part of the strategy of taking all sections of the society with him, not the opposition, the mantra of ruling thinking
 unhone kaha, ''ham lambey samay tak vipaksh main rahe isliye paripakvata ai, lekin ab hamen sattadhari party kii tarah vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 But after victory, there should be no frenzy, we should move forward with humility
 " unhone udhaaharan dekar kaha ki agar 100 kimi sadak banati he or usamen 100 meter kaa tukdaa kisi kaaran chhot jaataa he to ham usee kamajori par dhyaan dete hai or baaki mukchay uplabdhi ko bhula dete hai
 Whereas, instead of weakness, the big achievement of the government should be bounced in public
 modi ne sangh kii chaar peedhishon kii qurbaani kaa bhi zikr kiya
 He said, "we have seen the most defeat, joking when two seats came
" lekin hamen nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki yahaan tak laane main hamaari chaar peedhishon ne qurbaani di he
 Therefore, there is no change of power but our means
 hamen is balidaan ko dhyaan main rakhkar 2022 tak bhay-bhrashtachar mukt bharat bananaa he
 "he gave a clear message to the activists that the criticisms of the opposition should not be taken into account as they do not understand in which factory they make issues
 modi ne yaad dilaayaa ki pehle carch par hamale kaa aarope, phir award vaapasi or ab upi kii haar ke baad iviem par hi sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 With grandeur, the mega show of modi-shah Shodisha was to tell the story and new strategy of the party's era completely
 bhubaneshwar ke janata maidan main kareeb 55-60 hajaar varg foot kaa vaatanukulit bhavy pandal, jisamen odisha kii kala-samskruti kii puri jhalak piroi gai thi
 Along with the meeting place in the ground, an exhibition based on Antyodaya of Deendayal Upadhyay was held which showed the achievements of the Modi government for three years and also gave a glimpse of the victory chariot of the party under the leadership of national president Amit Shah
 bhubaneshwar kii baithak bijepi main badlaav kii purnataa kaa gavaah bhi bani
 The Prime Minister praised Shah fiercely
 modi ne kaha, ''amit shah ne ranneetikaar shabd ko nai pahchaan di he, jinhone saare rajnatik panditon ko jhuthla diya
 "he also chanted to erect an Amit Shah at every booth
 shah ne bhi apane adhyakshiya bhaashan main pradhanmantri modi ko aazaadee ke baad kaa sabase lokapriy netaa bataaya
 Bhubaneswar, known as the city of temples, did not have any corner or road where there is no BJP flag and hoardings
 sadakon ke kinare gaharaa kar bans kii balliyaan lagaai gai or us par majbootee se party kaa jhanda laharaaya gaya tha jaisi rajnatik majbootee vah 2019 ke loksabhaa-vidhansabha chunaav main chaahati he
 It is a reflection of how closely the system was managed that after three hoardings of Modi, one hoarding of Shah was installed throughout the city
 kaarykram kii bhavyata se gadgad modi ne apane samaapan bhaashan main paanch minute tak vyavastha kii saraahna kii
 Modi said, "the qualitative change is now clearly visible in the Odisha organization
" " unka ishaara kendriya mantri pradhan kii ore tha, jinhone is bhavy aayojan kii mukhya kaman sambhaal rakhi thi
 Modi, who is considered to be an important strategist of Modi in the government and Shah in the organization, has increased his graph by the way he created the atmosphere for the meeting in a short time
 party ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''pradhan apni sanghathanaatmak or prashasnic kshamta kii vajah se modi-shah donon ke khaas hai to odisha ke yuvaaon main bhi unako lekar utsaah dikhataa he
 "shah's Khas, who oversees the system and Arun Singh, national general in-charge of the Odisha BJP, says on the success of the executive," The message is clear that the BJP has to go to the highest position everywhere in the country and for that we have to work hard 
 "bijepi purvottar or coromandal ke rajyon kii ore bad chuki he
 Shah bluntly said that the formation or activism of the booth should be kept alive, not at the time of election
 party centre kii satta main hone or modi kii lokapriyata kaa laabh uthaakar sanghathan kaa aisa majboot taana-bana bunana chaahati he, taaki bhartiya maanchitr ke har hisse main camel khilaayaa ja sake
 In the Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh, the principal of a government school punished the girl students in such a way that the audience was shocked
 principal ne pehle chaatraon kii skirt utaravaai or phir skool ground main ladakiyon kii parade karai
 There is a lot of anger among parents from this case
 maamla jile ke sarkari skool kaa he
 Where students in class eight were given Sanskrit homework
 jise kaksha kii aathchatraone puraa nahin kiya
 The next day, when the principal received a complaint about the students not doing homework at school, she lost her temper
 principal ne pehle un chaatraon kii skirt utaravaai or phir unhen murga banaakar skool ground main ghumaya
 Principal Madam's anger did not calm down here, she also beat the girl's body
 is dauraan chatraayen unase maafee maangati raheen lekin principal ne unki ek nahin suni
 At the time when the girls were being shamed on the ground, many students present there were watching this scene
 is dauraan chaatraon kii video bhi banaai gai
 Later, Principal Madam threatened the girl students that if they do this then the video of the girls will be made viral on the Internet
 skool ke baad jab ladakiyon ne ghar jaakar abhibhavakon ko aapbeetee sunai to parijan sakate main aa gaye
 He first created a ruckus at the school and complained about the matter to top police officials

 Subodh Kant Sahay did everything that the nutritious leader of familism has done to bring his novice younger brother to the assembly with the aim of putting him in the political fray
 sunil ko tikat dilvaanaa unke liye pratishtha kaa prashn ban gaya tha
 His move was strongly opposed by many camps of the State Congress and the matter reached the Delhi high command
 kai dashakon tak congress main raheen pratibha pandeya ne naaraaz hokar party hi chhod di thi
 But Subodh Kant was successful in threatening the leaders sitting at the center to understand that the bus on Hatia seat is his own
 so, sunil hi ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 The Rajya Sabha elections were held in Jharkhand before Hatia by-election
 congress ke paas jeet ke liye nirdhaarit sankhya nahin thi or jharkhand vikaas morcha ne congress ko samarthan dene kii evaj main hatiya seat kii maang rakh di
 Anything like this could subvert Subodh Kant's hopes
 so, bhai ke liye hatiya seat pakki karne ke jugad main lage sahay ne apane dhur virdohi or congress ke rajyasabha pratyaashee pradeep kumaar balamuchu ko jharkhand vikaas morcha ke sahyog ke bina hi chunaav jitaane main apane rajnatik kad kaa safal pradarshan kiya
 Subodh Kant, who had earlier represented Hatia, had a clear intention
 is seat ko phir apni paariwarik seat bananaa chaahate the
 But his desire was not confirmed by his ardent supporters
 musalamaanon ne congress ko na ke baraabar vot diya to shahari matadaataaon kaa ek bada hissaa kadi dhoop main chamadi jhulasane kii bajaae ghar main hi kaid rahaa or jo nikle bhi, unhone congress ko vot nahin diya
 He was also far behind in those areas of Hatia which are considered to be Congress strongholds
 congress ke varisht netaa or purv pradesh pravaktaa alok dube safagoi se apni baat rakhte hai, ''dukhad he! unki hathdharmita or bhatru prem ne congress kaa satyanaash kiya he varanaa koi vajah nahin thi ki ham is seat se haarate
 People voted against their familyism, not against the Congress
 yah un netaaon ke liye chetavanee he jo parivaarwaad ko badhaava dete hai
 He tricked the central leadership
 jharkhand main hamaari party bahut teji se ubhar rahi thi lekin hatiya main party kii chhavi dhoomil hui he
 For which they are responsible ''party ke andar bhi kai netaa ise subodh kaant sahay kii nijee haar maanate hai na ki party kii haar
 He had given all his strength for campaigning and management and is no longer responding to defeat from them
 ve kehete hai, ''sunil party ke samarpit kaaryakarta rahe hai
 i will reply when the time comes
 chunaav jeetne ke liye sarkari mashinari or paise kaa khulkar durupyog kiya gaya or isamen koi hairat kii baat nahin he kyonki jis party ne chunaav jeeta, vah sarkaar ke un vibhaagon kii maalik he jiske hisse main puure rajya ke bajet kaa 60 fisadi hissaa aata he
 "he refers to the AJSU party whose candidate Naveen Jaiswal got 41,766 votes and defeated Ajay Nath Sahdev of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha by a margin of 11,000 votes
" chunaav prachaar ke dauraan sunil apni koi vyaktigat chhap nahin chhod paae the
 Says Pratibha Pandey, "those candidates seemed less, the mp's representatives more
 unki ekmaatr jamaa puunji yahi thi ki ve mantri ke bhai hai
 To win, they were either God-trusted or Subodh Kant
 lekin donon hi kaam nahin aae
 The defeat in Hatia has created a terrible situation for Subodh Kant with the loss of his stature

 dullat ko bhi chinar kii hi tarah sidhaa or sapaat mana jaataa he
 There is also a reason for his expertise in Kashmir
 may 1988 main jis din unhone srinagar main guptchar beuro ke upanideshak kaa kaarybhaar sambhala, tabase hi ve kashmiri siyasat kaa ek ahm hissaa rahe hai

 They report many lost opportunities in this state: for example, the release of Rubia Saeed in exchange for JKLF militants, which gave Kashmiris the chance to believe that independence was near; Failure to remove AFSPA after the successful assembly elections of 1996; Release of terrorists in Kandahar plane hijacking case; Disgrace after pledging to the nationalist leader Farooq Abdullah for the post of Vice President; The hidden possibilities in Yasin Malik were wasted (dulat admits about Malik, the self-styled version of the Chegwara, that there was not much hope anyway but it was quite disappointing); And Musharraf's term between 2004–07, when he was advocating a four-point formula

 Dullat says that in a state whose fate is stuck between Pakistan's arrogance and India's unwavering resolve, there are two major hurdles in the path of long-term peace - one, the hurt feelings of Kashmiri Pandits and the other, the undisclosed fear of Muslims that non-muslims Will ruin them
 dullat kehete hai ki iklauta samaadhaan srinagar main sabhi ke saath baat karte rahanaa he, bhale hi “algaavvaadi netritv ne baar-baar kashmir ko niraash kiya ho kyonki ve khud ko pakistan ke prati javabdeh samajhate hai

 The debate was going on here and the IC-814 aircraft flew there

 During the 50-minute meeting, the charge-and-counter game continued in the CMG and several top officials were accusing each other of allowing IC-814 to go beyond the Indian border

 This proves that the Taliban surrounded the aircraft with tanks and soldiers
 unka kahana tha ki unhone aisa isliye kiya he taaki apartaaon ko or zyada hinsa karne se roka ja sake, lekin aisa darasal hamen commando karrwai se rokane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It became clear that the airport was under the control of the ISI and in this entire development, the ISI was directing the Taliban

 unhone kaha, “sar, jaldi koi faisla kiijie kyonki ye log baichaiyn ho rahe hai or main nahin jaanata ki aage kya hoga
 Finally, after five days of negotiations, the demand for the hijackers was brought down to the release of three terrorists: Masood Azhar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar
 hamane masood ajahar ko 1994 main hi giraftaar kar liya tha

 @sardanarohit Political rhetoric is at its peak before the December 7 polling in Telangana
 ek taraf ol india majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin (AIMIM) ke mukhiya asaduddin ovaisi congress or bijepi par lagaataar hamalaa bol rahe hai
 So UP CM Yogi Adityanath, who reached for election campaign, has said that if BJP comes to power, Owaisi will have to leave Hyderabad like Nizam
 yogi ke is bayaan par ovaisi ne twit karke apni pratikriya di
 He said that listen to my answer in every procession from 7 to 10 pm
 ovaisi hyderabad kii goshamahal seat par tiares ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 @cmofficeupmera jawab zaroor suno 7pm se 10pm ke Har jalsa meinhttps: / / t
 co / hbvgbjbhld— Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi)december 2, 2018bataa den, vikarabad ke tandoor main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri or bijepi ke firebrands netaa yogi adityanath ne kaha ki yadi bijepi satta main aati he to main aapako bharosa dilaataa hum ki ovaisi ko telugana chhodkar vaise hi bhaagna padegaa jaise nizaam hyderabad chhodkar bhaage the
 Yogi's statement comes after a statement made by BJP MLA Raja Singh a few days ago in which he said that he would be satisfied only after beheading Owaisi
 isse pehle saidabad menek raily ko sambodhit karte hue ovaisine kaha tha ki madrason or muslimon ke dharmik sthalon ko band karne kaa prayaas ho rahaa he or ve (sarkaar) hamen (muslim samudaay) dekhnaa nahin chaahate
 Owaisi said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is repeatedly coming to Hyderabad to defeat AIMIM, while BJP President Amit Shah has visited five times
 wo (sarkaar) hamaari (muslim samudaay) aawaaj usee tarah khatm karnaa chaahate hai jaisaa unhone upi or bengal main kiya
 Addressing a public meeting in Narayanpet, BJP President Amit Shah said that this time the battle of Telangana is triangular
 ek taraf tiares or ke chandrashekhar raav hai, jinhone telugana ko AIMIM ke saamne ghutane tikaa die, to duusari taraf congress, jisane siddhu ko pakistan ke sena pramukh se gale milane ke liye bheja or teesri taraf rashtravaadi hai jinka netritv pradhanmantri narendra modi kar rahe hai
 In Rajasthan, BJP removed its state president but appointing a new state president is not easy
 nae pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar vasundhara raaje or kendriya netritv main thanti najar aa rahi he
 Therefore, a decision on one name is not being made
 kendriya mantri gajendra singh ke naam ko lekar jaipur main bijepi main hi virodh shuru ho gaya he
 Rajasthan elections are due in December, but the Rajasthan BJP is currently without a president
 pradesh adhyaksh ashok paranami se 3 din pehle istipha le liya gaya, lekin koi bhi adhyaksh nahin ban paaya he
 The name of Union Minister Gajendra Singh is discussed about the new president, but the BJP is not able to announce him either
 kaha ja rahaa he ki gajendra singh or mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke bich achche sambandh nahin hai or mukhyamantri khemaa yah nahin chahta he ki chunavi saal main koi aisa adhyaksh bane jisase vasundhara raaje kii nahin banati ho
 It is believed that this is the reason that Vasundhara Raje has been camping at Dhaulpur residence for the last 2 days
 idhar, bijepi ke kaddavar netaa devi singh bhaati ne vasundhara kheme kii taraf se gajendra singh ke khilaaf morcha khol diya he or kaha he ki aisa vyakti adhyaksh banegaa to bijepi ko chunaav main nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Devi Singh Bhati said that Gajendra Singh is a leader confined to Jodhpur, whose image is anti-jat
 aise main unhen adhyaksh banaae jane par rajputon ko khush karne ke chakkar main duusari jatiyaan naaraaz ho jaaengin
 Ashok Parnami, a close confidant of Vasundhara Raje, resigned from the post of president and is not ready to accept that he has been removed due to his failures
 balki wo yah kah rahe hai ki paariwarik jimmedaariyon kii vajah se maine yah pad choda he
 Also saying that there is no quarrel in BJP, the national president is in Bangalore right now
 unke aane ke baad faisla ho jayega
 However, it is also true that even when Ashok Parnami was removed from the post of President, the National President was not in Delhi
 idhar, bijepi ke ghar ke jhagade ko lekar congress maje le rahi he
 Various speculations are being made about the situation, but as much as the BJP is delaying it, the talks are spreading between the central leadership and Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje

 Therefore, he is well aware of Bhansali's thinking about a film
 wo waakif hai ki bhansaali apni film kii lead jodi kis tarah se tay karte hai
 'I did not have the courage to say to Sanjay sir to direct my debut film by citing relationship

 Because of Bhansali's assistant, she calls him Sanjay sir instead of maternal uncle

 'sharmin is confident that the audience will definitely come to the theater to see this love
 yah pyaar bhi pyaar hi he
 But there is something unique in it
 sharmin kahati hai, 'meri maa bela sahagal khamoshi edit kar rahi thim tab main unke pet main thi
 Since that time i have a connection to the film industry

 'sharmin ne jahaan acist karne ke dauraan bhansaali kii nirdesan kala ko dekha vahiin mangesh ke nirdesan main bataur heroin kaam kiya
 What is the specialty of directing these two? Sharmine says about this, 'mangesh Sir's vision is that a twenty rupee note is flying and a child is running behind him
 sanjay sar ke vijan main darbar, great castum matlab bhavyata
 He is a perfectionist
 mangesh puure imoshan ko dekhte hai
 Sanjay watches Emotion from Micro
 sanjay jaadu creat karenge
 Mangesh will wait and see that magic will come
 mangesh sichuation main daalate hai or jaadu kaa intjaar karte hai
 Sanjay Sir casts a spell on the situation

 'now it is also that as producer Sanjay and director Mangesh Malal are together, the audience will get to see something new from it

 If you want to stay away from illness, always keep these 5 things of the kitchen clean - if you want, you can maintain warmth in the house by burning many candles or lamps
 mombatiyaan or lamp aapako garmaahat kaa ahsaas dilaane ke saath romani ahsaas bhi dilaayengi
 Four days ago, no clue has been found of the Indian Air Force aircraft AN-32 which went missing in the Bay of Bengal
 vimaan main 29 log savaar the
 Even after a massive search and rescue operation that has been going on for the last four days, nothing has been known about the debris or survivors
 haalanki bengal kii khadi main vimaan kii khoj kaa dayera or badha diya gaya he
 An official gave this information
 vimaan kii khoj main lage 17 jahaaj, ek pandubbi or 23 vimaan samudr kii sataha par laapata vimaan ke malbe kaa pataa lagane main naakaam rahe hai
 So now the entire operation is also dependent on a signal from the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) mounted on the aircraft
 gauratlab he ki chennai se port blair ja rahaa vimaan bina koi immergency signal die hi achaanak laapata ho gaya tha
 The 'emergency locator transmitter' mounted in the Russian-made AN-32 aircraft is designed to start sending a type of signal as soon as it hits the water with a certain force
 ealti kii bydaree life kareeb ek maheene kii he
 In other words, it will keep sending signals at a fixed frequency for about a month which naval warships, submarines and Coast Guard ships will try to capture through their sonar system
 par yahaan ek asli chunauti he - is ilaake main samudr kii gaharaai kareeb 3
 Up to 5 kilometers, where there will be tremendous sea pressure, this means a smaller box-sized LTE is at risk of breaking, mainly if it was damaged at the time of the aircraft's crash
 ealti se milane vaale signal kii gunvattta par bhi asar pad saktaa he agar yah vimaan ke malbe ke neeche dab gaya ho
 The comments is prakriya main lanbaa samay lag saktaa he
 Last year, the Dornier aircraft of the Coast Guard crashed in the Bay of Bengal
 durghatana ke 33 din ke baad vimaan ke ealti se mili ek kamjor se signal kii madad se uskaa malba baraamad kiya ja sakaa tha
 At that time a marine reconnaissance aircraft detected an intermittent signal

 Let us know that the Olympic Canyon is not currently deployed in the Indian sea
 laapata een 32 ke liye bade paimaane par talaashi abhiyaan jari he or abhi tak ise roka nahin gaya he

 They also automatically detect metal objects floating in the sea
 in sab ke alaava pi8 main magnetic anomoli detector (medy) lage hai, jo khaastaur par pani ke andar dhaatu kii chizon kaa pataa lagane ke liye dizin kiye gaye hai
 Also, more than a dozen ships are engaged in capturing any signal from ELT of missing aircraft from their sonar system
 vimaan ke malbe kii talash tab or mushkil ho jaaegi jab uske ealti se kisi bhi tarah kaa signal nahin milegaa
 It took more than two years for investigators to find the wreckage of an Air France AF-447 plane that crashed into the sea near Brazil in 2009
 is kaam ko vishesh rup se isi uddeshy ke liye taiyaar kiye jahaajon main lage said sonar scans kii madad se anjaam diya gaya tha

 Swami Vivekananda has completed 125 years of speech delivered at the World Religion Conference in Chicago (USA) on 11 September 1983
 ye bhaashan unke jivan kaa aitihaasik bhaashan sabit hua
 125 years ago when Swami Vivekananda started his speech by saying 'my American brothers and sisters', after which the auditorium echoed all the way for several minutes
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne swami vivekanand ke chicago bhaashan or pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay ke janm shatabdi ke avasar par vigyaan bhawan main yuvaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 125 years ago, because of this dream, Swamiji had given the speech at the 'dharma Sammelan'
 Swami Vivekananda's struggle in Shikago would be surprising to know that Swamiji did not initially want to go to Chicago to give a speech
 lekin 25 july 1893 main unka jahaaj chicago pahunchaa
 The suffering he took to give a speech at the World Religion Conference in Chicago (america) was not a matter of any ordinary person
 swami ji ne khud likhaa ki 'jab unka jahaaj chicago pahunchaa tha to vahaan itani thand thi ki unhone likhaa he, ‘main hadidyon tak jam gaya tha'
 He further wrote that 'the clothes that his friends gave him while leaving Mumbai were not worth the harsh cold of Northwest America'
 shaayad mere doston ko thand kaa anumaan nahin tha
 When Swami Vishwavism arrived five weeks before the conference, he was alone on foreign soil
 vishwa dharm sammelan ke paanch hafte pehle vah galati se pahunch gaye the
 Chicago was a very expensive city
 unke paas paryaapt paise bhi nahin the
 And the money that was there was rapidly depleted
 
 
 
 Who are the Rohingya? Those who are not ready to adopt any country, they have written further, 'I did not understand where i should go with the burden of strange things brought along
 phir meri ajeeb-si veshbhusha lekar ladke mere peeche bhi daudte the'
 It proved difficult for Swamiji in a foreign city far from the country
 jab harvard uniwarsity ke professor jon rhite neunhen dharm sansad samiti ke adhyaksh kaa pataadia or unka parichay dete hue patr bhi diya lekin vah unase kho gaya tha
 When the train had to sleep, his body was broken into an empty stomach and exhaustion, after which he had to sleep in an empty compartment standing in the freight train caird to protect himself from the harsh winter
 khaane ke liye maangani padi bheelgali subah ve paas ke dhani ilaake lake shor drive main bhojan keliye bheekh maangane gaye
 But the people there considered him a thief and a robber and drove him away
 har daravaaje kii dahalij par unhen uphaas or tiraskaar hi mila
 After feeling so helpless, only one thing comes to his mind to leave everything and return to India
 vikram batra, jinaki shahadat kii kasame kargil kii pahadiyaan aaj bhi khaati hanjab nahin maani harlekin itane ksht sahane ke baad bhi vah date rahen
 There was a time when he could free Indians from poverty
 vah ye mauka nahin chhodana chaahate the
 Even though he had lost physically, there was still courage inside
 ek park main jaakar baith gaye or khud ko ishwar ke hawaale chhod diya
 After the speech given at the World Religion Conference, the night he was lying in bed, India was seen in front of him facing extreme poverty

 Vijay Rupani will be sworn in as Chief Minister for the second consecutive time
 nae mantrimandal main roopaani sahit kareeb 20 mantri honge
 There will be 10 cabinet and 10 ministers of state
 lekin roopaani ke shapath grahan ke saath ye apshagun bhi jude hai, jo charchaa kaa vishay bane hue hai
 First, two workers were killed at the venue before the swearing-in ceremony of the new CM Vijay Rupani of Gujarat
 haadasa gandhinagar sachivalay ke heliped ground par pandal nirmaan ke dauraan hua
 Three laborers working on the roof of the pandal fell down
 ghayal teenon mazdooron ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya lekin ilaaj ke dauraan do mazdooron ne dam tod diya
 The second ill-fated Rupani is going to occupy the throne of power in Gujarat for the second time
 vijay roopaani duusari baar jis ground main shapath lenge, us ground ke saath apshagun judaa hua he
 In Gujarat, when the BJP was first formed in 1995, Keshubhai Patel was sworn in at this heliped ground, but after three years his government fell
 iske baad kisi bhi mukhyamantri ne is ground main shapath grahan nahin kiya tha
 Rupani has been able to muster the courage to take oath at Heliped Ground after 22 years
 teesraa apshagunagujrat main bijepi ke mukhyamantri ke shapath grahan kaa vijay muhrt kaa samay nirdhaaran he
 Vijay Rupani is going to break this myth
 bataa den ki rajya main chaar baar mukhyamantri rahe maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi ke samay se hi shapath grahan ke liye prayukt hone vaale kathith muhoort dopaher 12 bajkar 39 minute tha
 At the same time, the Chief Minister used to take oath, from Modi to Anandi Ben and when Vijay Rupani became the Chief Minister for the first time, he took oath on this Vijay Muharta

 (input: bhashaa) Former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja believes that the limited overs series between India and Pakistan to be held later this month will put more pressure on the Indian team
 bharat or england ke bich test shrunkhlaa ke liye hindi camentator kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe raja haalanki maanate hai ki pakistan kii ballebaaji kamjor he or shahid afridi jaise olerounder ko gendbaaji ke bajaay ballebaaji main adhik yogadan dena hoga
 Raja was asked if there would be more pressure on India than Pakistan in the upcoming series, he said, "I think so, because India is playing on its soil
" pakistan kii team jab yahaan aegi to us par dabaav kam hoga
 i have played in India many times and i have felt that way
 unhone kaha, jab aap apane mulk main khelte ho to prashansakon kaa beintahaa dabaav hota he
 If Pakistan does not play here in front of their fans, then the pressure will be reduced on them
 bharat ko jarur gharelu sarajameen par khilne kaa phayda milegaa, lekin van-de yaa tii-20 main aap yah nahin kah sakate ki koun jitegaa
 Rameez said, but this much is certain that the match will be tough and hopefully it will be an exciting series
 jab bharat or pakistan kii siries hoti he to prayek khilaadi jaanata he ki isamen acha pradarshan karnaa kitna mahatvapurn hota he isliye har koi apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karne kii sochega
 The comments bharat or pakistan ke bich paanch saal baad dwipaksheeya shrunkhlaa ho rahi he
 Pakistan will play two T20 and three odis in this tour
 unhen ummid he ki england ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa se sabak lekar bharat is shrunkhlaa ke liye spinneron kii madadgaar pich banane kii galati nahin karegaa
 Rameez said, i think there will be no turning wicket for One Day
 tab ballebaaji ke liye anukool pichen banaai jaaengi
 Pakistan's team, especially limited overs, is a good team
 aapane dekha hoga ki vah tii-20 vishwa cap ke semifinal main pahunchi thi or uski ranking bhi acchhee he
 However, this former Pakistani captain feels that Pakistan's batting is weaker than India and in such a situation, it is very important for Afridi to perform well with the bat
 unhone kaha, afridi kii form chintajanak he
 If he does not bat, the balance will be disturbed
 gendbaaji to vah acchhee hi kar rahe hai, lekin pakistan ko abhi ballebaaj kii jarurat he gendbaaj kii nahin
 Rameez said that cricket should not be dragged into politics and it is necessary to promote the game to maintain harmony between India and Pakistan

 Cricket breaks boundaries
 cricket ko raajnneeti ke hathe nahin chadhana chahie
 Raja, who is playing the Hindi commentator for the Test series between India and England, however believes that Pakistan's batting is weak and an all-rounder like Shahid Afridi will have to contribute more to batting than bowling

 He said, when you play in your country, the fans are under tremendous pressure
 pakistan yahaan apane prashansakon ke saamne nahin khelegaa to un par dabaav kam hoga
 India will certainly get the benefit of playing at home, but in one-day or T20 you cannot say who will win
 ramij ne kaha, lekin itnaa tay he ki muqabla kadaa hoga or ummid he ki yah romaanchak siries hogi
 When India and Pakistan have a series, every player knows how important it is to perform well, so everyone will think of doing their best

 pakistan is daure main do tii-20 or teen ekadivasiy antarrashtriya match khelegaa
 He hopes that India will not make the mistake of making a pitch for spinners helpful for this series, taking lessons from the Test series against England
 ramij ne kaha, mere khyaal se van-de ke liye terning wicket nahin hogi
 Then the pitches suited for batting will be made
 pakistan kii team, khaskar simit overon kii acchhee team he
 You must have seen that she reached the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup and her ranking is also good

 The smaller allies have objected to the seat-sharing formula created by the Shiv Sena to save the alliance, while the BJP has also rejected it
 darasal, isse pehle sutron ke hawaale se khabar aa rahi thi ki shivasena ne gathbandhan bachaane ke liye ek nayaa formula banaaya tha, jiske tahat shivasena 151 siton par, bijepi 130 siton, jabaki anya sahyogi dal saat siton par chunaav lard sakate hai
 According to sources, the BJP looked ready on this formula and there was a possibility that it could be approved in the meeting on Tuesday evening
 lekin gathbandhan main shaamil chote sahyogi dal unhen di ja rahi siton kii sankhya se khush nahin hai or ve baithak bich main hi chhod kar chale gaye
 The Shiv Sena is now trying to convince these allies, and now a meeting has been called again on Wednesday
 vahiin bijepi kaa kahana he ki vah 130 siton se santusht he or use khud ke liye zyada siten nahin chahie, lekin vah chote sahyogi dalon ke saath ninsaphi nahin hone degi
 He has also rejected this formula of Shiv Sena, giving this reason
 gauratlab he ki bhaajapa ne shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare dwaara seat bantwaare ko lekar die gaye puraane formule ko thukraa diya tha
 According to this formula, Shiv Sena was to be given 151 seats for the 288-member state assembly, 119 for BJP and 18 seats for other allies

 a top US diplomat has said that India is still the 'new player' in Asia which is dominated by China
 unhone vishwaas jaahir kiya ki nai dilli bhavishya main ahm bhoomika adaa karegaa
 Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell said at the Aspen Institute on Tuesday, "china has dominance in every aspect of political, financial, economic and security relations
 bharat abhi bhi asia main nayaa khilaadi he
 i believe that everyone has high expectations that they will move forward
 ’unhone kaha ki 21veen sadi ke itihaas kaa bada hissaa asia main likhaa jane vaala he or america ko us itihaas main apni bhoomika nibhaani he
 Campbell said, 'to do this, we have to be more actively partnered not only with one or two governments but with many
 khaastaur se hamaari ranneeti, kootneeti, aarthik or vyapaar bhagidaari, saanskrithik aadan pradaan ke har str par
 'he said,' Although the military dimension, which is actually very modest in this regard, has received the most attention
 ’ sahaayak videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki rajanyik pahal aamtaur se dhyaan main kam rahaa he
 'he said,' There have been many questions whether it be called rebalancing, axis, tilt or anything else
 mujhe ‘punarsantulan’ pasand he or main iskaa istemaal karuunga kyonki yah ek prakriya sujhata he jiskaa satat vikaas hota he
 This requires continuous better relationship
 ’campbell ne kaha ki asia prashanth kshetra main america kii niti china ko kaabo karne kii nahin he
 He said, 'I have never heard any senior Chinese diplomat say in any formal structure that US policy is going to be under control
 ’ 35000 crore rupees is spent in Madhya Pradesh in 15 years that water from the house reaches the tap
 nal kahaan gaya, jal kahaan gaya or dhan kahaan gaya
 Today we are going to tell a long report
 ham aapako bihar main samarsible pump ke zarie sookhaa paidaa kiye jane kii factory ke bare main bhi bataaenge
 We will also tell about the Chennai crisis
 aap bharat main paidaa kiye ja rahe pani ke sankat ke bare main padhate chaliega
 In a few days, monsoon rains will start and the news of floods will start coming from somewhere
 lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki bharat main pani kaa sankat kam ho jayega
 Even during the rains some parts of the country remain dry
 pani kaa sankat tezi se hamaare kareeb aa rahaa he
 You may not be able to watch it on TV but villages are being emptied due to water crisis
 kahin kahin jal sangrakshan ke kaam bhi ho rahe hai
 If nothing is done with water from today and now, even bottle water will not be available for a day
 niti ayog kii report kah rahi he ki 60 karod bhartiya gambhir jal sakant se guzar rahe hai
 That is, half the population of India is surrounded by severe water crisis
 saaf pani nahin milane ke kaaran har saal do lakh bhartiya mar jate hai
 Every day, 547 people die in India due to clean water
 kya ye aankade kaaphi hai pani ko lekar kuch karne ke liye yaa abhi ham intazaar karenge ki har din 1000 log marenge tab kuch karenge
 The water crisis will deepen by the year 2030
 sochie is sankat ke rahete kya hamaari koi bhi uplabdhi bataane yaa gane laayak ho sakati he
 The British newspaper Independent has written that now if we plant trees on the land left on the earth, then we are not going to avoid global warming
 hamaare paas raste kam bache hai
 The news of Chennai is reaching you less
 aaj chennai kii pahchaan plastic kii rang birangi gagariyon se ho rahi hai
 Pictures coming from Chennai show that as long as the villages were drying up, the towns were not drying up, then the metros were not worried but now one metropolis of India has started drying up
 pani lene kii qatari main khadi auraton ko dekhie
 Look anywhere in India
 aapako lagegaa ki pani kaa sankat sirf auraton kaa sankat he
 It does not belong to men
 mard jaise hawa pikar kaam chalaa rahe hai
 After all, why can't they be seen carrying water
 jahaan bhi dekhie bharat main auraten or bachche khaskar bacchiyaan pani dhoti nazar aa rahi hai
 Chennai has been facing drought for three consecutive years
 aspataal tak main pani nahin he
 It is also being said in the IT sector that people should work at home
 daftar na aaen
 The government has reduced the supply of water by 40 percent
 madras racidency main kabhi hazaron talab hua karte the magar unhen bhar kar shahar ke liye plot kaat diya gaya
 Built an airport in the flood basin of the Adyar River in Chennai city
 flud basin kaa matlab hua ki baadh ke dinon main nadi kaa pani jahaan tak failata he
 We grabbed the land of the rivers
 yahaan kii daldali zamin ko bhar kar maas rapid transit system bana diya gaya
 So the city was submerged in December 2015 by floods
 saikadon log maare gaye the
 The land that nature had given to rain water could absorb it, it disappeared
 uske baad se yahaan sookhaa hi sookhaa he
 People have started paying up to Rs 2500 for a tanker
 ab wo bhi mahangaa hone laga he
 Tankers are also fetching water from somewhere
 jisase jal str ghat hi rahaa hoga
 The arrival of the tanker is telling that the water crisis is getting ready at some other place
 pani kaa sankat ab har jagah he
 The area of madhubani and Darbhanga in Bihar where there used to be a pond at every step, now there is no water
 lakhon talab kii is dharti par talab kahaan gaye
 Obviously someone must have been robbed
 atikaraman kar ghar or dukaan bana liya hoga
 We all have tolerated this and now everyone will have to face the water crisis in return
 talab suukh gaye to logon ko laga ki boring se kaam chal jayega magar boring se bhi pani upar nahin aa rahaa he
 Tankers are running everywhere
 is vakt bharat main pani agar kahin hai to tanker main he
 Our colleague Pramod Gupta did a story on this earlier, we want to tell about it again
 darbhanga main 9 aise vishaal talab hai jo 900 saal se adhik puraane hai
 The number of government and private ponds at this time is 839
 zyaadaatar suukh gaye hai
 One block of this district is Birol where there are 890 ponds
 is zile ke kisi bhi prakhand main jaaiye 200-250 talab milenge jinhen sthaneey bhashaa main pokhar kaha jaataa he
 40 years ago there were about four thousand ponds in Darbhanga district
 aadhe laapata hai or baaki suukh chuke hai
 The government goes on writing slogans on the walls
 jal na rahe yadi jagat main, jivan he bekaar tip
 The hand pumps in front of the houses have dried up
 ab sabko sabmarsible mil gaya he
 For this, boring machines have been installed from UP and Rajasthan
 darbhanga main dhadadhad pani kaa str neeche ja rahaa he
 In a city so many subcircles have been installed, the result of this will be visible in a few days
 zaahir he pani ke sankat ko lambey samay tak andekha kiya gaya or ab bhi kiya gaya
 It may be that this story of crisis in rain floods goes backward, but the same situation is going to return after rain
 talab kaa system sookhaa hi nahin balki atikaraman kaa bhi shikaar hua he
 Plots have been built by cutting the plot and malls are built
 sochie in talabon se lakhon ko rojgaar miltaa tha
 Earnings were made from fish and makhana
 ab wo bhi gaya
 Water crisis brings with it so many crises
 ab aapako baar baar bataane kii zarurat nahin he
 Pramod Gupta said that once a stream of 29 rivers used to pass through Darbhaga district, many of these have disappeared
 ab aate hai hamaari raajnneeti kii dharaa ko sinchit karne vaale bhu mafia par
 The land mafia first makes the records of the ponds disappear from the government record room
 phir talab ko bharne main lag jaataa he
 When a citizen complains, the officer asks him to bring the record where the pond is
 zile ke record room main talab kaa record nahin miltaa
 Then he goes to Patna and Ranchi
 is bich talab kaa swaroop hi badal chukaa hota he
 Someone else becomes the owner of the pond by fake name and then the land is sold
 bhartiya vyavastha main bhu mafia kaaljayi sanstha he
 He is found everywhere
 jahaan jagah nahin hoti he vahaan bhi hota he or jahaan jagah hoti he vahaan to hota hi he
 The Land Revenue Department of the Government of Bihar had told the Patna High Court in March 2017 that more than 12000 ponds were victims of encroachment
 bhu mafia ekadam se nirdayee nahin hota he
 He first usurps the pond but also sells water as a tanker mafia
 itnaa pyaara bhu mafia duniya ke kisi bhu-bhaag main nahin milegaa
 When the government seizes the land, it is not called the land mafia
 vikaas kehete hai
 Like where AIIMS of Patna is being built
 jahaan ban rahaa he vahaan pehle 35 acre zamin main faili jhil thi jise bhar diya gaya
 Prime Minister Modi has said that he will deliver water from house to house
 bihar main har ghar ko nal se jodne kii yojana chal rahi he
 Where will this water come from? pani pahunchane se pehle ham sabhi ko niti ayog kii report padhani chahie
 By 2020, there will be a severe water crisis in 21 cities
 dilli, bangaleru, chennai, or hyderabad bhi inamen shaamil he
 100 million of these cities will be in the grip of water crisis from next year itself
 2030 tak bharat kii aabaadi kaa 40 fisadi hissaa pani se vanchit hoga
 70 percent of India's water has been polluted
 pradooshit pani ke maamle main bharat 122 deshon main 120 number par he
 It is not that we or you have not gone through such figures before
 inkaa istemaal zyaadaatar niabandh or fasebuk post likhane main hota he, samaadhaan main kam
 By the way, whenever you see such a report or announcement that water will be transported from the pipe, it will investigate properly
 ham pani ke saath samuhik or saamudayik jivan jite rahe hai
 Piped water gives hope of a better life, but where should the water come from should be discussed first
 thik he ki 75 pratishat gharon main pipe se pani nahin pahunchataa magar in gharon ko jahaan se pani mil rahaa tha, us par hamalaa kisne kiya
 Why did they dry up
 pipe kaa pani samaadhaan nahin he
 In Chennai itself, there has been a 40 percent reduction in the supply of pipes
 pradhanmantri kehete hai ki ghar-ghar pani pahunchaa denge
 Only water will reach
 bihar main 31 march 2020 tak sabhi gharon ko pipe se pani pahunchane kaa kaarykram chal rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar has decided to provide water through pipes to every house in Bihar
 is par tezi se kaam bhi ho rahaa he lekin yah pani kahaan se aa rahaa he
 For this, thousands of submersible pumps are being installed in Bihar
 yani zamin se pani khinch kar pani pahunchaaya ja rahaa he
 At a glance, it will be seen that this is a brilliant plan, but soon the water will dry up under the ground
 pani kaa str or neeche chalaa jayega
 Submissible is creating a terrible water crisis every day by any logic
 24 may 2018 ko patna times of india ne ek report chhaapi he
 It said that the Patna Municipal Corporation has approved 375 submersible pumps in its area
 yah shahar ke sabhi 75 ward main lagaae jaaenge
 a pump costs 15 lakhs
 sarkaar karodon rupee kharch kar pani ke sankat ko jaldi jaldi bula rahi he
 This is also the same thing that tanker mafia do
 darbhanga nagar nigam main bhi 48 sabmarsible pump lag chuke hai
 Soon 96 submersible pumps will be installed
 yahi nahin rajya ke naagarik apni taraf se bhi sabarmisbal pump lagava rahe hai
 In Darbhanga, the shopkeeper told that 16-17 submersible pumps are being installed in the city every day
 haryana, rajasthan or upi se boring kii mashine maganvaai gayi hai
 In this way only 1500 1600 pumps have been installed here
 puure bihar main sabmarsible kaa dhandha ban gaya he
 People are spending from 80,000 to 1 lakh out of their pocket for water
 rajya main pani nahin he magar ghinaune str par pani kaa dhandha fail chukaa he
 In a city you will get hundreds of submersible pumps installed, then you cannot imagine how deep the water crisis is
 times of india kii khabar he 2016 kii
 a private company was assigned to install submersible pumps in Gaya
 privet company ne ghotaalaa kar diya or logon ko pani nahin pahunchaa
 The matter had reached the court
 ye sabmarsible pump bihar ko do saal ke bheetar pani viheen kar degaa
 Remember me agar pradhanmantri sabmarsible pump se pani pahunchane kii kisi yojana ke bare main soch rahe hai to unhen bihar main hi isaki jaanch kara leni chahie
 It is known that the ground water level is continuously going down
 sabmarsible pump is prakriya ko bullate train kii raftaar se tej kar degaa
 Now comes to Madhya Pradesh
 11 samvaadadaataaon kii mehnat se yah report bani he
 The water crisis has also become severe in Madhya Pradesh
 rajya ke 350 se adhik nagar nikaay hai
 Municipal bodies say in English
 ye nikaay pani nahin de paa rahe hai
 Somewhere, water is coming after three days and somewhere after two days
 ab isaki kai vajahon main ek vajah ghotaalaa bhi he
 This scam may be happening in other parts of the country as well, but this report by Anurag Dwari is showing the way of what is happening in the name of saving water
 madhya pradesh kii bijepi sarkaar ne 15 saalon main nal jal yojana par 35,000 karod kharch kiya
 But only 6 percent of the rural population got water
 paisa kahaan gaya or pani kahaan gaya
 In the game of corruption, the money must have gone not only to the leader but also to the pocket of thousands of officers
 lekin keemat log chukaa rahe hai
 Agar Malwa to Zafar Singrauli to Devendra, Chhatarpur to Arvind, Diddori to David, Mandsaur to Manish, Jhabua to Sachin, Katni to RB Gupta, Dewas to Arvind, Badwani to Munaf Bhind, Dilip to Ratlam and Sajid to Anurag Dwari report together

 In view of the seriousness of these allegations, the High Court had ordered the DDA to present all the records to the court, but even after several hearings, when the dda's lawyers and officials did not present these records, the angry court directed the DDA director in this case Has summoned iske saath hi hycourt ne dilli sarkaar ko ye baaten sunishit karne ke nirdesh die hai ki privet skulon me koi bhi eadblooes kii seat khaali na rahane paae
 In the past years, the court has often received such complaints that due to lack of information from schools, EWS children are not able to get admission and taking advantage of this, private schools give admission to general category children with heavy donation

 There are 102 love poems in this collection
 prem se ot-prot in kavitaaon main manushya kii komal bhaawanaaon or shaashvat prem kii jhalak he to saath hi sanyog or viyog bhi he
 Shukla engraves all forms of love with equal sentiment
 chaahe vah deh ke anuraag se janma vaasanamak prem ho yaa naitik prem bandhan
 These poems make the realization that to love, to understand his feelings, to live in love, is not a matter of everyone
 kabhi-kabhi to ghar, parivaar or samaaj se bhi ladanaa padataa he
 Human settlement also becomes lonely because love is beyond all boundaries, so social beliefs have to be broken
 shukla kii in panktiyon main prem kii khamosh abhivyakti or usase upji virah vednaa kaa sahaj chithran dekhie—itnaa sambhav nahin / ki tumne / patr na baanche ankhon ke / lekin o abhivyakti srujayani / tu ne maun varan kar daale
 Shukla considers love to be a great support
 prem manushya ko insaan banaata he or usamen duusare kii bhaawanaaon ko samajhane kii drushti paidaa karata he
 The poet also points to the hollowness and dullness of the relationship
 aaj baahar se khush najar aane vaala insaan bheetar hi bheetar tuutata ja rahaa he—man reete / andar rote baahar gaate / sari umr kati aise hi / ghaav chhupate
 Actually the lack of love and trust makes relationships hollow
 in kavitaaon ke kram par gaur karen to usase unka bhav spasht jhalkata he
 As soon as my body was soaked with tears, i always kept on meditating, i touched you a lot, you did not call me
 ye kavitaayen prem sambadhon main maano nijee jindagi kii kahani bayaan karti hai
 Yes, if their individualistic thinking is effective then there is a lack of social thinking
 kavitaaon main ekarupata najar aati he
 So lack of diversity also leads to dullness
 lekin in kavitaaon ke jariye prem ke kai roopon kaa jaayaka liya ja saktaa he

 Then why did he cry and cry? Don't everyone return from the fair with sweets and garlands of flowers? Some are entertained only by seeing the fair shops and men and women standing on them
 gangi khaati-piti thi, hansati-bolti thi, kisi ne use munh latakaaye, apane bhagya ko rote nahin dekha
 After getting up at night, take the cow dung, give it to the cow and the oxen, and then dabble up, it was a regular rule
 tab vah apane bhaiya ko gaay duhane ke liye jagaati thi
 Then bring water from the well, the business of the foursome would start

 In this overflowing ocean of youth, there were no rippling waves, there was no fear of thunder, there was an empire of unshakable peace
 2holi aayi, sabane gulabi saadiyaan pahanin, gangi kii sari na rangi gayi
 Mother asked - Daughter, i should also paint your saree
 gangi ne kaha-nahin ammaan, yon hi rahane do
 Bhavaj sang Phag
 vah pakwaan banaati rahi
 He was happy in this
 tisare pahar duusare gaanv ke log holi khilne aaye
 These people will also return to Holi
 gaanvon main yahi paraspar vyavhaar he
 Macu Mahato had got the breach made, charas-ganja, Majum brought everything
 gangi ne hi bhang pisi thi, mithi alag banaayi thi, namakeen alag
 Her brother used to drink, she used to wash hands
 jawan sir nicha kiye pikar chale jate, buudhe, gangi se puch lete -acchhee tarah ho na beti, yaa chuhal karte- kyon ri gangiya bhavaj tuje khaanaa nahin detii kya, jo itani dubli ho gayi he! gangiya hanskar rah jaati
 Did the body belong to him? na jane kyon vah moti hui thi
 People started singing songs after drinking the breach
 gangiya apni choukhat par khadi sun rahi thi
 a young Thakur was singing
 kitna acha swar tha, kaisaa meetha
 Gangia was enjoying a lot
 maan ne kai baar pukaara- sun ja
 She did not go
 ek baar gayi bhi to jaldi se laut aayi
 He was focused on that song
 na jane kya baat use khinche leti thi, baandhe leti thi
 The young Thakur also used to look at Gangia again and sing calmly
 uske saath waalon ko aashcharya ho rahaa tha
 Where did Thakur get this accomplishment! When those people left, Gangia stood on the frame
 jawan thakur ne bhi uski ore dekha or chalaa gaya
 Gangia asked her father- Who used to sing Dada? Macu said- The boy of Buddha's house is Garib Singh
 budhu reeti vyavhaar main aate-jate the
 After his death, the same boy started coming and going
 gangi- yahan to pehle pahal aayaa he?maiku- haan, or to kabhi nahin dekha
 The mood is exactly like that of the father and is as sweet
 ghamand to chhu nahin gaya
 There was no place to keep grain in the fool's barn, but if we saw Chamar, he would have raised his hands first
 vahi iskaa swabhaav he
 Goru was coming
 gangi pagahia lene bheetar chali gayi
 The same voice was echoing in his ears
 kai maheene guzar gayi
 One day Gangi Dung was walking
 sahasaa usne dekha, vahi thakur sir jhukaaye dwaar par se chalaa ja rahaa he
 She stood up leaving the cow dung
 ghar main koi mard na tha
 Everyone went out
 yah kahana chaahati thi-thakur! baitho, pani pite jaav
 But he could not speak
 uski chaati kitne jor se dhadq rahi thi
 He started having a strange panic - what to do, how to stop him
 garibsingh ne ek baar uski ore taaka or phir ankhen nichi kar leen
 What was the matter in that vision, Gangi's cries stood up
 vah daudi ghar main gayi or maan se boli- ammaan, vah thakur ja rahe hai, garibsingh
 Mother said - must have come from some work
 gangi baahar gayi to thakur chalaa gaya tha
 She then started dung, but the dimples used to break, you would automatically close your hands, but then start to feel shocked, as if the sound was coming in her ears from far away
 vahi drushti aankhon ke saamne thi
 What was the magic in that? What was the siren? He said something in his silent language
 gangi ne bhi kuch suna
 What did you say? She does not know this, but that vision was in her eyes
 raat ko leti tab bhi vahi drushti saamne thi
 The same vision appeared in the dream
 phir kai maheene guzar gayi
 One day, at dusk, Macu was sitting at the door, and Gangi was mourning the bulls that suddenly shouted - Dad, Dada, Thakur
 maiku ne sir uthaaya to dwaar par garibsingh chalaa aa rahaa tha
 ram-ram happened
 maiku ne poocha- kahan garibsingh! pani to pite jaav
 The poor came and sat on a match
 uskaa cheharaa utraa hua tha
 He looked a little sick
 maiku ne kaha- kuch biimaar the kya?garib- nahin to dada!maiku- kuch munh utraa hua he, kya sood-byaaj kii chintaa main pad gayi?garib- tumhaare jite mujhe kya chintaa he dada!maiku- baaki de di na?garib- haan dada, sab bebaak kar diya
 Macu said to Gangi - daughter, go get some Thakur to drink water
 bhaiya ho to kah dena chilam de jaae
 The poor said- Let the grandfather live! i don't drink maiku- abaki ghar hi tamaaku bani he, sawad to dekho
 Do you drink? Poor - don't make this so bad, grandfather
 kaaka ke saamne chilam nahin chhui
 i give you their place
 yah kehete-kehete uski ankhen bhar aayin
 Macu's heart also sank
 gangi haath kii tokari liye murti ke samaan khadi thi
 All his consciousness, all his feelings, were drawn towards Garib Singh's words! He had no power to think anything else, and to do nothing
 oh! kitni namrata he, kitni sajjanta, kitna adab
 Macu again said - Did not hear daughter, go to drink some water! Gangi was shocked
 daudi hui ghar main gayi
 Cleaned the bowl, took out a little bit of it
 phir lotaa-gilaas manjkar sherbet banaaya
 Mother asked- Who has come to Gangia? Gangi - She is Thakur Garib Singh
 doodh to nahin he ammaan, ras main mila detii?maan- he kyon nahin, hadi main dekh
 Gangi removed all the cream and added it to the juice and came out with a lotta-glass
 thakur ne uski ore dekha
 Gangi bowed her head! Where did this inhibition come from? Thakur took the juice and went after Ram
 maiku bolaa- kitna dublaa ho gaya he
 Gangi - are you sick? Macu is worried and what? Man alone, such a big arrest; What to do
 gangi ko raat-bhar neend nahin aayi
 What concerns do they have
 dada se kuch kaha bhi to nahin
 Why are you so hesitant? cheharaa kaisaa pilaa pad gaya he
 In the morning, Gangi said to her mother - Garib Singh has become very thin this time, mother! Mother - now where is that childless daughter
 baap ke jamaane main khate the or khelte the
 Now the web of arrest is on the head
 gangi ko is jawaab se santosh na hua
 She went out and said to Macu - Dada, you did not explain to Garib Singh - why do you worry so much? Macu looked tearfully and said - Go, do your work
 gangi par maano bajrapaat ho gaya
 That harsh answer and grandfather's mouth
 hai! dada ko bhi unka dhyaan nahin
 No one is his friend
 unhen koun samajhaae! abaki vah aayenge to main khud unhen samjhaaoongi
 Gangi would think every day - she must have come, but Thakur did not come
 phir holi aayi
 Then there was a panic in the village
 ramaniyon ne phir gulabi saadiyaan pahanin
 Then the color was mixed
 maiku ne bhang, charas, ganja mangavaaya
 Gangi again made a sweet and salty breach! Tots were laid at the door
 vyavhaari log aane lage
 But no one came from the room
 shaam ho gayi
 No one knows! Gangi was desperate
 kabhi bheetar jaati, kabhi baahar aati
 She asks brother - did not the closet come? Brother says no
 dada se puuchhati- bhang to nahin bachi, kothaar vaale aavenge to kya peeyenge? dada kehete- ab kya raat ko aavenge, saamne to gaanv he
 You would have seen raat ho gayi, par gangi ko abhi tak aashaa lagi hui thi
 She climbed over the temple and looked towards the hall
 koi na aata tha
 Suddenly, he saw a fire burning towards the same border
 dekhte-dekhte jwaala prachand ho gayi
 What is this! Holi is burning there today
 holi to kal hi jal gayi
 Who knows where the priests have told the truth of burning Holi today
 tabhi ve log aaj nahin aaye
 Will come tomorrow usne ghar aakar maiku se kaha- dada, kothaar main to aaj holi jali he
 Macu - Daggli! Holi was burnt everywhere yesterday
 gangi- tum maanate nahin ho, main mandir par se dekh aayi hoon
 Holi is burning
 na patiyaate ho to chalo, main dikhaa don
 Macu- Well let's see
 maiku ne gangi ke saath mandir kii chat par aakar dekha
 Keep watching for a minute
 phir bina kuch bole neeche utar aaye
 Gangi said - is it Holi or not, you did not believe? Macu - Holi is not crazy - Chita
 koi mar gaya he
 At that time, the Kothar people did not come today
 gangi kaa kalejaa dhak-se ho gaya
 So someone called from below - Macu Mahato, Garib Singh of Kothar passed
 maiku neeche chale gayi, par gangi vahiin stambhit khadi rahi
 There was no news - who i am, where i am, it became known that Garib Singh is looking out of that distant pyre and looking at him - he had the same vision, the same face, could she forget him? Never went to see Holi again from that day
 holi har saal aati thi, har saal usee tarah bhang banati thi, har saal usee tarah phag hota tha; har saal abir-gulaal udati thi, par gangi ke liye holi sadaa ke liye chali gayi

 Actually these seeds are not easily digested and often cause kidney stones
 5
 Consuming too much of tomato can cause bad odor from the body
 tamaato main tarapins naamak ek tatv paaya jaataa he
 When this element breaks down during digestion, it causes bad odor of the body

 logon kii baat chhodie, ab ek mahila ko hi sexi main kuch bura nahin lagata
 Women are also not common, they are Mamta Sharma, Chairperson of National Commission for Women

 These are gentle women Mamta Sharma, Chairperson of the National Commission for Women
 wo mahila jinpar desh bhar kii mahilaon ke sammaan kii raksha kaa jimmaa he
 But today these women and girls are sitting to explain the meaning of sexy
 wo shabd, jo ek jamaane main gaali bhi samajhi jaati thi
 When this word was used in a song, the song itself was changed
 lekin mamata ji kii dictionari main sexi ke myne hai khubasurat or charming
 Now Mamta ji gave this statement in a mild manner or she was serious while saying, know it right there
 haa, kal ko chowk-chauraahey par shohade agar ye kah den ki bura naa maano sexi ho to vaaki bura mat maniega
 Otherwise, they will have the answer that if they do not believe, then ask Mamta Sharma ji
 haalanki mamata sharma kii ‘saxi’ sambandhi kathith tippanee par bhaajapa kii tyoriyaan chadh gayi or party ne unhen is pad se hataae jane kii maang kii
 Bharatiya Janata Party state vice-president Suman Sharma has demanded Mamata Sharma's comment to be removed from the post of the president, not considering his remarks
 unhone kaha ki mamata sharma kii tippanee se mahilaon ke saath chhedkhani karne vaale asaamaajik tatwon ko badhaava milegaa
 Mamta Sharma later denied the allegations, saying that she had not spoken anything wrong and that her intentions were being misquoted
 mamata ne kathith taur par kaha tha ki ki saxi kaa matlab ‘sundarata or khubsuurati’ se he or iskaa galat arth nahin lagaaya janaa chahie
 When there was a ruckus on Mamata's statement, then she thought it prudent to withdraw her statement

 Nelson Mandela was speaking with Governor Nurul Hasan at the grand court hall of the Raj Bhavan in West Bengal
 tabhi main apni patni ke saath vahaan pahunchaa
 i was so familiar with him that two days ago i met him in Delhi as a member of the Indian Welcome Committee
 lekin ve mere pahunchate hi ekadam khadey ho gaye
 They met my wife saying "women are before governors
" ” unhone meri patni se garmjoshi ke saath haath milaayaa jabaki nurul hasan ne puraane jamaane kii aupchaarikta ke anuroop halke se muskaraakar swaagat kiya
 Mandela's behavior is very mild, but it shows that the superintendent who described "humanity above race, culture and all kinds of variations" valued formal etiquette beyond protocol
 mandela ke liye koi bhi cheez maamuli nahin thi or aise mahanayake kii mrityu kaa shok manaane kii jarurat nahin he
 They never accept it
 unhone kaha he, ''mrityu to avashyambhavi he
 a person, when he has done all that he considers his duty to his people and country, he can leave this world in peace
 main samajhataa hum ki maine vah koshish kii he isliye main gahari neend main sounga
 May God fulfill his wish
 magar yahaan yah jarur joda janaa chahie ki mandela ne bhale hi apane logon or apane desh ke prati kartavya puraa karne kii baat kii lekin unhone mahatma gandhi or martin luther king junior kii tarah puri maanavtaa kii seva kii
 They conquered hatred
 unhone shwet or ashwet ke bich kii khai ko kam kiya
 He also said, "if you want to make peace with your enemy, then you have to work with your enemy
" tabhi vah aapkaa saajheedaar banegaa
 Mandela, Gandhi and the American author of King on Civil Disobedience, like Henry David Thoreau, believed that justice-loving people cannot tolerate unjust laws

 For the first time, he was sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment for inciting the workers to strike and leave the country without valid documents
 do saal baad hi umr kaid kii sajaa mil gai
 He believed that "if someone is denied the right to live life according to his beliefs, he has no choice but to break the law," and that "the world's most famous political prisoner" regrets his actions can not do
 mandela kaa janm sampann parivaar main hua tha
 His adopted father, Chief Jongintaba Delinedbo, head of the Thembu people, wanted his son to become a counselor to a 'loyal' chief or to an interpreter or clerk — a black in apartheid South Africa could have aspired to these same jobs
 lekin unka pehla naam rolihlahla (jhesa bhashaa main jiskaa shabdic arth 'ped kii tahani toduya’ hota he) yaa ''shararti” yun hi nahin padaa tha
 In his speech at the age of sixteen at Mandela's traditional circumcision ceremony, a chief expressed regret at the bleak future of black youth because his country was occupied by whites
 unke bhaashan se mandela ko maano divya gyaan praapt ho gaya
 Mandela later said that the same speech ultimately sowed the seeds of South African independence in his mind

 The pan-africanist Congress was challenging the ANC and Mandela claimed that the Gandhian philosophy of tolerance shaped the ANC
 ” unhone 1961 main umakhonto ve sijve (rashtron kaa bhaalaa) naamak sanghathan kii sah-sthapana kii jiskaa uddeshy bhitarghaat karnaa or chhapamar yuddh karnaa tha

 mandela pratirodh ke kaaphi majboot pratik ban gaye the
 The United States and Britain feared that Africa's most prosperous nation (possibly even equipped with atomic bombs) could be devastated by civil war, so they began supporting the international campaign to release Mandela
 lekin mandela ne apni rihaai ke badale sashastr sangharsh chhodie kaa vaada karne se inkaar kar diya
 Then Frederick Willam de Klerk became president and Mandela was released on 11 February 1990, and the apartheid system was also abolished
 mandela ne ashweton ko matdaan kaa adhikaar dilaane ke liye videshi takaton se apana dabaav banaae rakhane kaa aagrah karte hue pran liya ki jab tak is lakshya ko hasil nahin kar liya jayega tab tak eensi kaa sashastr sangharsh jari rahegaa
 After being elected president of the ANC in 1991, his diplomatic prowess came at a time when he compromised on the white minority from black majority rule
 us samay shwet log ashweton ke mukaable zyada udaaravaadi lag rahe the or dakshin africa main lagaataar halchal machi hui thi
 But under Mandela's leadership, the country overcame this difficult time, and a year before the country's first democratic election, he and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993

 karnataka main kumaraswami sarkaar girane ke baad ab ye sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya madhyapradesh main bhi karnataka jaisaa haal hoga
 After the fall of Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka on Tuesday evening, the first major response from the Madhya Pradesh BJP has come in the night
 madhyapradesh vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh gopal bhargav ne kaha ki madhyapradesh main jald hi sarkaar apana pindadaan karavaaegi
 Actually, Gopal Bhargava was reacting after the government fell in Karnataka
 is dauraan unhone kaha ki langadi sarkaron kaa yahi haal hota he
 Now there will be better development in Karnataka
 iske aage unhone karnataka kii tulana madhyapradesh se kii or kaha ki madhyapradesh kii bhi lagbhag yahi sthiti he, kyonki yahaan jo transfar udyog chal rahaa he, kisaanon ke saath chal kapat kar unase vot le liye
 In Madhya Pradesh, there has been loot, plunder and corruption
 mujhe vishwaas he madhyapradesh kii sarkaar bhi apana pindadaan karavaaegi
 However, this is not the first time that Gopal Bhargava has made such a statement
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii jeet ke baad bhi gopal bhargav ne rajyapal se vidhansabha kaa satr jald se jald bulaane kii maang kii thi, taaki modi lahar main floor test karvaa sake
 What is Madhya Pradesh's number game? Everyone in Madhya Pradesh also keeps an eye on it because no party has majority in the assembly of 230 mlas
 madhyapradesh main bahumat kaa aankada 116 he, jabaki sabase badi party congress ke paas 114 vidhayak he yani bahumat se do kam
 The Congress formed the government with the support of BSP, SP and independent mlas
 aankadon par najar daalen to congress ke paas 114 vidhayak hai to vahiin pramukh vipakshi party bijepi vidhayakon kii sankhya ke maamle main sattadhari dal se zyada peeche nahin he
 The BJP had 109 mlas, but recently after becoming MP from ratlam-jhabua seat, the local BJP MLA resigned from the assembly, after which the BJP now has 108 mlas
 vidhansabha main 4 nirdaleey vidhayak he
 2 mlas are from BSP and one MLA is from Samajwadi Party
 assam vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle narendra modi sarkaar ne pakistan or bangladesh se aae hinduon or sikhon ko kanoonee manyata dene kii taiyaari kar lee he
 The English website 'NDTV' has published the news quoting sources that the central government wants to help religious minorities coming from Pakistan and Bangladesh who want to settle in India
 khabar he ki sarkaar unke liye yahaan rahane kii ijaajat dene ke sambandh main aadesh bhi jari kar sakati he
 This decision of the government can change the fate of millions of refugees from neighboring countries
 bataaya jaataa he ki pradhanmantri ke daftar (piemo) kii pahal se yah faisla kiya ja saktaa he
 It is worth mentioning that on his visit before the Lok Sabha elections, the Prime Minister had talked about giving citizenship of India to religious minorities coming from both the countries
 iskaa sabase zyada asar assam main hoga, jahaan agle saal vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 The Assam Accord was signed in 1985 between the central government and the leaders of the Assam movement
 iske mutabik, 1971 ke baad bangladesh seemaa se desh main aane vaale rifuji desh se baahar kiye jane the
 But till now this work has not been completed
 amit shah ne bhi kiya tha wadamana ja rahaa he ki assam chunaav ke maddenjar bijepi sharnaarthiyon kaa card khel sakati he
 The future policy of the government on immigrants will give Bangladeshi refugees hope of getting citizenship later
 27 april kibijepi adhyaksh amit shahne bhi apane assam daure par kaha tha ki agar bijepi satta main aati he to bangladesh se aae hindu sharnaarthiyon ko bharat kii naagarikta di jaaegi
 Interestingly, the ruling Congress is also in this favor
 mukhyamantri tarun gogoi bhi bangladeshi apravasiyon ke liye 'maanavtaa ke aadhaar par' naagarikta kii maang karte rahe hai
 However, his party is accused of being busy in wooing the majority votes of the state

 "ready for Test" Rohitgambhir said, "and if you choose Rohit in the team and don't have a place in the middle order, then Rohit is such a good player that he will do well
" agar aap unhen chun rahen hai to unhen antim-11 main rakhen or agar nahin rakh pate hai to test main unhen na chune

 Are ready to play agar yah kargar rahata he, to is kadam ko ‘masterstroke’ mana jayega

 This is the bjp's sixth consecutive victory in Gujarat
 bijepi ko is baar jeet dilaane main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ahm bhoomika he
 This victory seemed to be the most difficult for the BJP in the last two decades
 is baar kaa gujarat vidhansabha kaa chunaav mahaj gujarat ke liye nahin ladaa ja rahaa tha, balki desh kii siyasat ke liye bhi ek litmus test mana ja rahaa tha
 This is the reason why Narendra Modi weaved himself into a political party of Gujarat and converted it into victory
 brands modi main badhegaa bharosagujrat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani hai lekin rajya vidhansabha ke siyaasi ran main bijepi kaa cheharaa narendra modi hai
 In the last few years, farmers and traders, including Patidars, Dalits, have expressed their displeasure on the road against the BJP in Gujarat
 isse bijepi baikfoot par najar aa rahi thi or vipaksh inhen muddon ko lekar chunaav main utraa
 On the other hand, BJP was hoping to win with the help of Narendra Modi's face
 aise main rajya vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey bijepi ke paksh main aane se brands modi ke prati logon kaa bharosa or bhi badhegaa
 The path of 2019 will be easy, the results of the Gujarat assembly elections will also have an impact on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi-congress donon partiyaan gujarat ke raste 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ko saadhane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Modi made 2019 easy by making BJP successful in Gujarat
 gujarat ko semifinal ke taur dekha ja rahaa tha
 Impact on the 2018 assembly elections: The results of the Gujarat assembly elections will have an impact on the next year's state assembly elections
 agle baras kai ahm rajyon main chunaav hone he
 These include states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Odisha
 bijepi gujarat vidhansabha chunaav jeet ke nateezon ko in rajyon ke chunaav main bijepi ke liye phayda dilaaegaa
 modi-shah's supremacy in BJP will increase; If BJP wins in Gujarat Assembly elections, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah will increase political supremacy in the party
 modi-shah ke khilaaf party main kisi bhi kadam par party ke netaa sawaal uthaane se bachenge
 Although modi-shah dominates the party even at the present time, it will give Gujarat victory and strength
 gujarat model ke aalochakon ko karaara javabgujrat vikaas model par lagaataar sawaal vipakshi dal uthaa rahe the
 Even before the bugle in the Gujarat assembly elections, the Congress had given the slogan of 'vikas Pagal Gaya Gaya', a direct attack on the development model of Gujarat
 itnaa hi nahin congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi bijepi ko gherne ke liye gujarat vikaas model par sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 bjp's victory in Gujarat amidst all this
 gujarat ke vikaas model par sawaal uthaane waalon ke liye karaara jawaab he
 Steps towards economic reforms: Gujarat is also considered as an economic state
 notebandi or jiesti jaise kade kadam narendra modi ne uthaae hai
 The traders of Gujarat took to the road and also demonstrated against GST
 iske alaava congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi modi sarkaar ko gherne ke liye jiesti ko mudda bhi banaaya he
 Despite this, if the BJP manages to win Gujarat's political rival Narendra Modi, then the government will take even more stringent steps towards economic reforms
 vipaksh main bikharaav badhegagujrat vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii jeet se vipaksh ko karaara jhatka laga he
 The defeat of Gujarat will create frustration not only in Congress but also in anti-bjp parties
 itnaa hi nahin gujarat main haar se vipachhi dalon kii ekajutata main bikharaav badhane kii sambhaavna he
 The defeat of the Congress in Gujarat may leave many of its allies together
 isse jahaan congress kaa kunba kamjor hoga to vahiin bijepi khemaa majboot hoga
