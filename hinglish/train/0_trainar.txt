 Shravasti has suffered severe floods eight months ago
 lekin us tabaahi ke baad ab yahaan badlaav kii bayaar bahani shuru hui he, usase 32 saal kii phool kumari ke chehre par muskaan aa gai he
 The seven-month-old son of Phoolkumari of Beraipurwa village in Ekona block died due to malnutrition four years ago
 pichley saal doctoron ne uski ek saal kii beti pallavi ko bhi atikuposhit bataaya
 But after that the camp in the village's Augillary Nursing Midwifery (ANM) Center changed the life of the girl child
 phool kumari kahati hai, ''main lagaataar bacchee ko dikhaane laai
 It was here that vaccines were found, registries were found and now he is out of danger
 '' unki tarah yahaan kii kai auraton or unke kuposhit bacchon kaa jivan badal gaya he
 Shravasti is one of the few districts in the country where infant mortality is above normal
 yahaan saal main ausatan 7,500 se adhik bachche kuposhan or swasthya sevaaon ke abhaav ke kaaran dam tod dete hai
 But the special 'jeevan Camp' which has been running for the last six months has changed the picture of Child and Women's Health Services in the district

 sarkaar ne turant tatkaaleen jiladhikari (dm) bhanu goswami ko hataakar krishi vibhaag main vishesh sachiv 57 varshiya nikhil chandra shukla ko shravasti kaa dm banaakar bheja
 Shukla has set many examples in his very first term as DM
 bhinaga sthit unke sarkari awaas ke baahar nem plate ke upar dm se 'milane kaa samay har samay' (24 ghante), likhaa he
 This is a unique example
 unhone mahila or bal swasthya kii gaadi ko patari par laane ke liye jile ke sabhi eenem kendron par niyamit taur par 'jivan camp' lagavaaye
 Here not only the health of the mother, her infant and pregnant woman began to be investigated, the essential medicines were found, the vaccines were given, but here, from opening a bank account, a month of nutrition and hand washing soap was given free
 varsh 2013 main jahaan shravasti main mahaj 1,488 mahilaon ne prasav purv jaanch karwaai thi, vahiin agle varsh ke ant tak yah aankada 5,548 tak pahunch gaya
 If we trust a survey conducted by the Health Department in Shravasti in January, the infant and maternal mortality rate in this district is likely to fall by more than 60 percent this year, which will be the first such case in the entire country

 This is not just a case
 aise ek hajaar se adhik maamle kuch maheenon main bina kisi vivaad ke nibataae ja chuke hai
 In a survey conducted within days of becoming DM, Shukla came to know that 1,626 cases related to land disputes were pending in 536 villages
 unhone inke nibatare ke liye inspector, tehseeldaar, chaar consteble or chaar lekhpal kii das sadasyeey kul 12 timen banaain
 These teams stayed in the respective villages until all the disputes were over

 "so far, five phases of this unique campaign started in July last year, 1,285 disputes have been settled
" keval 381 maamle bache hai, jo kisi nyaayalay main chal rahe hai
 Shukla says, "the biggest success of this campaign is that no one has appealed against it after settling the land dispute
" saath hi koi exiar yaa karrwai nahin hui he
 "its effect has also been shown in the form of improvement in law and order
" isi se utsahit hokar ab pradesh sarkaar ne anya jilon main bhi shravasti kii tarj par bhoomi vivaad nibatane kii yojana banaai he
 Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan says, "I have ordered the DM and SSP of all the districts to address public grievances on the lines of Shravasti

 "the electricity started, Rajaram Verma, a student of the Government Intermediate College, Prayagpur, will not have to prepare for the board examination this time in the light of Dhibri

 In Shravasti, more than 40 per cent of the electricity used to be stolen and poorly maintained
 lekin isi saal 12 janvari se jile main 'line los' kam karne kaa kaaryakam shuru kiya gaya
 Shukla explains, "we explained to the people that this is not a campaign to stop power theft, but to strengthen the power system
" '' bijli vibhaag ke record ke mutabik, shravasti main contia lagaakar bijli kii avaidh chori karne ke 6,500 maamle the or ab ye ghatakar 2,000 se kam rah gaye hai
 Where no electricity meter was installed in any village, now more than 4,000 families have got meters installed outside their house by taking permanent electricity connection
 ek maah chale is abhiyaan se line los 35 pratishat se ghatakar 8 pratishat par aa gaya

 Input IANS nae daur main haryana kii lok gayikee raagini kaa janaa-maan naam sapana choudhary he
 Who rules thousands of hearts with her voice and style
 lekin logon main khushiyaan baantne vaali yahi sapana ab jindagi or maut ke bich jhul rahi he
 The reason for this is his attempt to commit suicide
 jehar khaane ke baad sapana aspataal main bhartee hai
 Fighting for her life in ICU
 lekin sawaal ye he ki aakhir usne aisa kiya kyon? aakhir kyon usko uski jindagi achaanak hi bojhil lagane lagi?in sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab sapana ke suicide note se mil jaataa he
 Earlier, Sapna had also given this later indication through her Facebook post that everything is not going well in her life
 kuch log use saazishan badnaam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In fact, Sapna, a resident of Najafgarh, Delhi, was sued by a person from Gurgaon, Satpal Tanwar, under the SCST Act
 is mukademe kii buniyaad tab padi, jab sapana farvari main gudgaanv main ek kaarykram ke dauraan raagini gane pahunchi thi
 In the ragini that Sapna sang that day, according to folklore traditions, all the caste-fraternity comments were made in different ways for the people
 lekin ye tippanee gudgaanv ke satpal tanvar naam ke shaks ko kuch itani nagavar gujri ki usne sapana ke khilaaf thane main report likhva di
 This is where Sapna's troubles started
 halaat kuch itane bigade kii sapana ko bachaav main aana padaa or usne baqayada soshal site par ek video daal kar apni galati kubul kii or maafee bhi maangi
 The controversy with this apology from Sapnaikaye, who was battling between life and death, should have ended, but it was reversed
 yah vivaad thamane kii bajaay or bad gaya or ab soshal site par bhi sapana ke khilaaf abhadra tippaniyon kii shuruyaat ho gai
 The situation for Sapna continued to get worse from bad to worse, but in the meantime something happened that Sapna could not tolerate her and she took the step which she should not have taken at all
 aaj sapana jindagi or maut ke bich jujh rahi hai
 Everyone is wishing for their skill
 sapana kii adaa ke hai lakhon log divanebatate chalem ki sapana choudhary bhale hi chote-chote manchon par parform karti hai, lekin unke naam par saikadon logon kii bheed jutati he
 Sapna enjoys considerable fame in many districts of Haryana and UP including delhi-ncr
 har umr ke log unke gaanon par diwaanon kii tarah jhuumate hai
 He may not have fame like Bollywood, but has millions of fans
 sapana ke gaanon main sharaarat bharaa jo dance hota he, us par lakhon yuva fida hai
 That is why whenever Sapna performs live shows, people are seen swinging around the pandal from the stage
 sapana kaa 'he solid body' geet he mashhoorbehad kam umr main hi sapana ne stage ko apni zindagi kaa sapana bana liya tha
 Sapna, who suddenly made headlines after the suicide attempt, is famous in many states
 sapana ke mutabik, kareeb 9 saal kii umr se hi unhone dance or gane ko kariyar bana liya tha
 She is originally from Rohtak
 vah haryana, dilli or pashchimi upi main kai live sho karti rahati hai
 All his videos are seen on youtube
 unka gaaya hua ek geet 'he solid body' logon ke bich behad mashhoor he
 The police has recorded afresh, more than 48 lakh people have seen this song on youtube
 raagini ke jariye sapana behad desi andaaj main logon ke saamne parform karti hai
 Millions of rupees are spent on his songs, dance and songs
 vah aksar soshal site par kaaphi sakriy rahati hai
 Hundreds of thousands of people gather in villages, towns and cities in the name of Sapna on stage
 lekin sapana kii raagini ko lekar shuru vivaad is mode tak bhi pahonchega, ye kisi ne nahin sochaa tha
 Police has filed a fresh report in this regard

 It sure does
 But let's never underestimate what distance teaches you
 Being away from home in the city of New York, i realized i was walking amongst so many stories
 Each trying to write their own chapter in different ways
 Each struggling to do it but never giving up
 Each taking it # onedayatatime
 And now I'm on my way back to where my heart is
 It's a feeling i can't describe in words but I'm going to try - it's the joy to see my family and friends again, the excitement to do what i love and mainly the gratitude for the journey I've had up until this moment
 The fight is not yet over
 
 
 but I'm happy and looking forward to this happy interval :) It's time to learn that there is a new normal out there and i can't wait to embrace it and # switchonthesunshine

 america sarkaar ke H-1B vija policy ko lekar nae prastaav ne bhartiya iti sector kii chintaa badha di he
 In fact, the Trump government proposed a major change in the H-1B visa application process on Friday
 kya he nayaa prastaavnaye prastaav ke tahat H-1B vija chaahane vaali companiyon ko pehle se apni arji electronic madhyam se registerd karne kii jarurat hogi
 The purpose of this proposal is to grant H-1B visas to foreign employees with modern skills and high paid salaries
 bataa den ki bhartiya iti companiyon or profeshnals ke bich H-1B vija kaaphi lokapriy he
 Obviously, the most affected Indian professionals will be the proposed changes to the H-1B visa process
 nascom ne jataai chintatimes of india kii khabar ke mutabik iti services ke sheersh sanghathan neshnal association of software and services companyj (nascom) ne bhi america sarkaar ke haalia prastaav ko lekar chintaa jaahir kii he
 NASSCOM said the move would create "uncertainties" and could cause jobs crisis in the US
 haalanki nascom ne yah bhi kaha ki vah in nae prastaavon kii saavdhaneepurvak samiksha karegaa or iske moolyankan ke baad hi apni tippanee degaa
 NASSCOM stated, "there is not much time left for the next lottery of H-1B visas to open in April 2019
 companiyaan pehle hi apni jaruraton kaa aankalan shuru kar chuki hai or agle saal ke liye aavedan jamaa karne kii taiyaari kar rahi hai
 So we are concerned about the uncertainties that may arise due to the new proposal from the US
 "nascom ne jor diya ki trump sarkaar kii niti videshi iti companiyon ke liye america main apni special services dene ko kathin or mahangaa banaati he
 It will also weaken American companies that depend on other companies to meet their skills shortage
 yah karrwai america naukariyon ko khatre main daal sakati he or iti ke kaamkaaj ko america main karne ke bajaae videsh bhejne kaa dabaav daal sakati he
 Maximum 65,000 H-1B visas limit The US Parliament has set the maximum limit for H-1B visas in a year
 uske mutabik ek vitt varsh main adhiktam 65,000 H-1B vija jari ho sakate hai
 However, 20,000 H-1B visas are issued annually to foreigners pursuing master's degrees from the US or pursuing higher education
 nae niyamon ke mutabik USCIS ke paas yah adhikaar surakshit hoga ki vah america main ucch shiksha praapt aavedak ko 65,000 vija limit se chhot de yaa nahin

 With its rivals in a tizzy, Xiao has actually taken the Indian telecom sector into its grasp — but has also raised serious questions for consumers
 bazaar main agar keval ek yaa do doorsanchaar khilaadi hi bache rahenge to is ekadhikaar yaa do dhruviya sthiti main graahak ke saath aage chalakar kya hoga? kya kam khiladinnon ke hone ke kaaran unhen baar-baar manamaani mulya vruddhi kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa? kya yah saste mobile ke us daur kaa ant he, jo zyaadaatar mulya vardhit sevaaon jaise data ke bade paimaane par upyog ke liye jimmedaar hai?keval upabhokta hi anischitata kaa saamana nahin kar rahe hai

" dioti ke saath apni asahmati main, companiyon ne tark diya tha ki apane aavantit spectrum kaa upyog karte hue unke mukhya kaarobaar ke aadhaar par unase paise vasule jane chahie
 The DOT had stated that the definition of AGR includes dividends, capital gains due to interest, gains on sale of assets and securities and various other things like gains from foreign currency fluctuations, etc

 Pulled swords At the end of October, the Cellular Operators Association of India also wrote to telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on behalf of the companies about the deepening crisis in the sector and the possible negative consequences on the industry due to AGR dues
 lekin iske baad reliance jio ke saath vakyuddh chhid gaya, jisane apane patr main kaha tha ki iske pratidwandviyon ke saamne jo sankat he

 Another reason is the constant change in policy and rules

 Uddhav Thackeray's government in Maharashtra has been successful in a majority test
 thakare sarkaar ko bahumat sabit karne ke liye 145 vot kii jarurat thi or use 169 vot mili hai
 Let me tell you that there was a lot of uproar in the House before the majority test
 bijepi netaa or purv siem devendra fadanvis ne kaha kimaharashtra vidhansabha satr kaa aayojan sanvaidhanik mandandon ke tahat nahin he
 He also questioned changing the pro tem speaker and said that without the speaker there is no vote of confidence
 unhone kaha kibharat main kaaryvahak adhyaksh ko kabhi nahin badla gaya to bhaajapa ke columbakar ko pad se kyon hataaya gaya
 This is the opposite of nimams
 haalanki kaaryvahak vidhansabha adhyaksh dilip walse patil ne fadanvis ke daavon ko khaarij karte hue kaha rajyapal kii anumati ke baad satr kaa aayojan kiya gaya he
 During this time, slogans of 'dadagiri won't do' were also raised in the House
 hangaame ke bich bijepi ne sadan se walk out kar diya or fadanvis sametaparty ke vidhayak sadan se baahar chale gaye
 After this the process of vote of confidence was completed
 bataa den ki 288 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main congress, shivasena or ensipi ke kul 154 vidhayak hai
 In such a situation, the Thackeray government has also got the support of some independents and Bahujan Vikas Aghadi mlas
 haal hi main yah khabar charchaa main rahi he ki karan johar prabhas ko apni film se bollywood main launch karnaa chaahate the, lekin unhone fees itani zyada maangi ki karan ne apana iraadaa chhod diya
 Prabhas had asked for a fee of Rs 20 crore
 diene ne ek sutara ke hawaale se apni report main bataaya he, telegu cinema main prabhas kii fees 20 karod rupye ke aasapaas bataai jaati he, lekin bollywood main is tarah kii fees kii ummid karnaa jaij nahin he
 No South Indian actor, even Rajinikanth, gets such a fee in Hindi films
 bahubali or uske sikval ke hit hone ke baad karan johar unhen apni film main lenaa chaahate the, lekin unhone jo fees bataai use sunakar karan ne prabhas ko chhodane kaa iraadaa kar liya
 Dear Ambition
 
 
 if you have to achieve your full potential stay away from your arch nemesis
 
 
 
 Comparison!— Karan Johar (@karanjohar)october 26, 2017bataa den ki varun dhawan ne bhi apni film judawaan-2 kii safalataa ke baad apni fees badhaai he
 They are demanding remuneration of around 25 crores for a film
 jaankaron se ise jaij tehraaya he
 Now, the question arises that after Prabhas giving such a big hit, 25 crores is not justified, while Varun Dhawan's 25 crores is justified
 prabhas kii fees sunakar hi peeche hat gaye karan johar, padhein aise 7 maamleis masale par karan johar ne bhi ek twit kiya he
 He has written, 'dear Ambition, if you have exploited your full capabilities, stay away from the enemy named Comparison
 ' karan kaa ishaara donon kii tulana na kiye jane kii ore he
 These fees for Prabhas are also not big, because they are charging Rs 30 crore for Sain's next film Saaho after Bahubali
 prabhas kii bahubali worldwild sabase zyada kamai karne vaaleen bhartiya filmon main se ek he
 His film Shah Rukh's Jab Harry Met was heavy on Sejal and Salman's tubelight
 is singer ne kariyar ke shikhar par chodi thi plabac singing, ye he vajahpahale bhi kai maamle aise aae hai, jab karan fees ke kaaran peeche hate hai
 Kareena Kapoor Khan and Karan Johar may be the best friends today, but at one time, their friendship broke because of money

 Karan made this offer a day before the release of Kareena's film Mujhse Dosti Karoge
 iske baad karan ne film main priti jinta ko le liya tha
 Ever since Swami Prasad Maurya left the BSP, a question remains as to which party he will now join
 pichley dinon unke dwaara khud kii party banane ke bhi sanket mili the
 But meanwhile, Union Minister of State for Manav Resources Ramshankar Katheria said in Varanasi on Tuesday that Swami Prasad Maurya would be welcome if he comes to BJP
 bijepi netaaon se mili the mauryadarasal kuch din pahaleswami prasad mauryadilli main bijepi ke varisht netaaon se mulaakaat karne pahunche the, vahiin kendriya manaav sansaadhan rajya mantri ramshankar katheria ke bayaan se saaf he ki maury ke liye bijepi kaa darwaja philhal khulaa hua he
 BJP opened the doors for Maurya, although during this time, on the question of Ram Shankar Katheria Neshrato, he said that there is no condition here, he said that he does not know about whom Swami is meeting, but if he comes to the party then he is welcome is
 ramshankar katheriakashi viapeeth main chaatr sangh ke kaarykram main shaamil hone pahunche the
 Also, which trend is the news

 At the same time, the government argues that this will give her real feedback and then she will be able to make plans and make them more public useful by making changes

 Ayan Ranjan, who has spent a long time in Europe, loves his country like a traditional NRI
 ve apane desh kii dilachasp kahaniyon ko apane european doston ko sunaate hue garv mahasoos karte hai, bob dilan ke gane sunate hai or ek khaas previllage ke saath apana jivan bitaate aae hai
 Ayan's posting takes place in a village where two girls have been raped and hung from a tree
 police prashasan is cese ko rafa dfa karne kaa bharsak prayaas karti he
 This is a strong cultural shock for Ayan
 use apane desh kii ek alag tasviir dikhti he jo uske sapanile bharat kii tasviir se kahin zyada syah or dhundhlee he magar wo is cese kii tah tak jaataa he or is puri yatra main use kai kadavi sachchaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Ayushmann Khurrana has appeared in many such films before this film, which talked about social issues amidst laughter, but the level of darkness in this film is very strong and the cinematography of the film managed to show the same intensity in the screen
 Has been daraavne becoground mujeec ke saath sardiyon kii dhundh ke bich latakate ladakiyon ke shav siharan paidaa karte he vahi ek seen main bina kisi suraksha ke manhole main ghuste shaks ke sahare anubhav logon ko anubhav karana chaahate hai ki samaaj kaa ek hissaa aaj bhi hamaari anbhigyata ke chalate buree tarah pratadit he
 There is a lot of melodrama in the film in some places like Ayan wants to give justice to the girls and he does not get any problems from the system
 jabaki desh main kai aise maamle hai jab system ke khilaaf jane ke chalate kai eemaandaar afasaron ko apni jaan se haath dhonaa padaa he
 It can be said that horror is sometimes more real life than the reel life of Bollywood movies
 film ke hero manoj paahwa he
 He played the role of a policeman who loves animals but is cruel to humans
 pichley kuch samay main secred games ke police kirdaaron ke baad manoj ke kirdaar main grey shades hai or ant tak unka kirdaar praasangik bana rahata he
 The same Ayushman Khurana and Kumud Mishra have also acted well
 ayushmaan or unki garlfriend ke bich samvaad jaahir karte hai ki mordan daur main koi apper class shahari ladkaa bharat kii antadiyon main faile cast system ke jehar se kaise deal karata he vahi kumud-manoj paahwa ke sahare police prashasan main faile jatvaad system kii dark reyalti bhi dekhne ko milti he
 Sayani Gupta looks and looks like a village girl, but the dialect and body language reflect urbanity
 film main becoground mujeec kuch jagahon par maarak sabit hota he haalanki kuch jagahon par isaki bilkul jarurat mahasoos nahin hoti
 Mohammad Zeeshan Ayub has done a good job in the character influenced by Dalit leader Chandrashekhar
 film main ayub kaa kairactor zyada bada nahin he lekin kaise activism kii duniya main shaamil hone ke baad aam jindagi se aise netaaon kaa naata tut jaataa he, is pidaa ko jishaan dikhaane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 In many parts of the film, the political era of the current era is shown symbolically
 brahraanon-daliton kii ekta ko bhunaata ek rajaneta, is ekta ke khilaaf khadaa ek dalit netaa, mari gaay kaa chamada chhilne par pitate daliton jaise kai seens aise hai jo maujuuda samay kii raajnneeti ke kai pahaluon ko bhi dikhaate hai
 At a time when many films inspired by pseudo nationalism are being released in Bollywood, Anubhav serves the same bitter truth in front of the people who have been hollowing out the country for years
 ye film logon ke bich cast system ko lekar jaagrukta failaane kaa kaam kar sakati he lekin ye kitni asardaar hogi, ye faisla logon ko hi karnaa he
 At a time when a large part of the country is not far away from the water crisis, 15 big cities are among the most polluted cities in the world, unemployment rate is the highest in many decades, the problem like global warming is left standing, In such times, it is permissible to completely eliminate the old problems to face new challenges

 With this same energy and knowledge of entrepreneurship, here in India you are making a different path

 But, we know that much more remains to be done
 jalwaayu parivartan, maanavadhikaron or aise tamaam muddon par aaj duniya bharat ke netritv par bharosa kar rahi he
 The basis of friendship between India and America will remain with shared values of democracy, pluralism, opportunity and innovation
 ham donon ke saamne ek hi jaisi chunautiyaan hai—kaise zyada se zyada logon ko garibi se baahar nikaalen, unhen aarthik avasar den
 Our concerns are also the same - from terrorism, nuclear proliferation to new threats posed by robotics and artificial intelligence, job creation and cyber warfare
 nirankushta se lekar galat soochna ko hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal karne jaise jatil khatre bhi hai jo loktantric deshon main failte ja rahe hai
 Today we are going through a global duel between liberal, open, diverse, pluralistic democracy and growing dictatorial boom
 america bhi badi chunautiyon se jujh rahaa he
 From the press, the judiciary, the Congress, to politics, there is a sense of mistrust and discrimination against all the institutions that form the foundation of democracy
 loktantr vaaki khatre main he
 Therefore, it is important at this juncture that we stand with courage and ensure that democracy in India and America does not get bogged down in anger, malice and frustration

 " Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, who attended the program of India Today Safdigiri Award 2018, said that do not view the cleanliness of the West as just social work
 ise aamadani se bhi jodakar dekhie
 Gadkari gave an example of this
 unhone bataaya ki nagpur shahar main gande pani se methane gas nikalati he
 If we separate the CO2 from methane, bio CNG is released
 is samay ham 222 baio diwester bana rahe hai

 There, the fallen leaves of the trees were collected and burnt daily by trucks

 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj somvaar shaam sanyukt raashtra mahasabha yani yuangie ko sambodhit karengi
 During this time, she will not only give a befitting reply to the allegations made by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Kashmir, but will also insist on getting the opinion of all the countries on the Comprehensive Agreement on International Terrorism i
e
 CCIT
 bharat is samjhaute ke jariye antarrashtriya manch par pakistan ko duniyabar main alag-thalag karne kii kootneeti main juta he
 What is CCIT? India started a comprehensive agreement on international terrorism in 1996
 is samjhaute par dastakhat karne vaale desh aatankwaadi guton ko surakshit panaahagaah yaa aarthik madad muhaiyaa nahin karaane ke liye baadhya honge
 Under this, any form of international terrorism is proposed to be included in the category of crime
 yah samjhauta yuangie kii tadarth samiti ke saamne vichaaradhin he
 The biggest screw on this agreement is that there are differences between some countries regarding the definition of 'terrorism' and 'terrorists' contained in this agreement
 inamen pashchim ke bhi desh hai
 After the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008, India is trying its best to implement this agreement
 2012 main tatkaaleen videsh rajya mantri i ahamed ne yuan main is masale ko uthaaya tha or vishwa samudaay se sisiaiti apnaane kaa anurodh kiya tha
 On 27 September 2014, PM Modi once again raised the issue of CCIT in UNGA
 beete july main dhaka main hue aatanki hamale or haal main uri main hue aatanki hamale ke baad bharat is samjhaute ko lekar phir se gambhir hua he
 Definition of Terrorism Under the Convention, the definition of offenses of terrorism is proposed as follows: 1
 koi vyakti gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se or jaanboojhkar koi aisa krity karata he, jisase(a)kisi shaks kii maut ho jaati he yaa gambhir rup se jakhmi ho jaataa he, yaa(b)saarvajanik yaa nijee sampatti ko gambhir taur par nuksaan pahunchataa he
 This also includes public use, government space, public transport or damage to the environment
 yaa(c)aise nuksaan se bade paimaane par aarthik kshati hoti he to aisi ghatana par sarkaar yaa antarrashtriya samudaay aisa karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai karne par majaboor hogi

 In fact, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman raised the import duty on gold from 10 per cent to 12 while presenting the general budget last July

 Gold trade has declined sharply due to increase in import duty

 Seeing the deteriorating condition of the stock market, investors are betting on gold

 The global factor is also being invested in gold by central banks around the world amid calls of responsible economic slowdown

 aspx bhartiya janata party ke 'gandhi' yani menka gandhi or varun gandhi ke loksabhaa kshetra ko aapas main badal diya gaya he
 BJP has given Maneka Gandhi a ticket from Sultanpur instead of Pilibhit in the Lok Sabha elections this time
 vahiin, varun gandhi sultanpur kii jagah pilibhit se maidan main utrenge
 The BJP has not changed the mother-son ticket in the same way, but has fielded them under a thoughtful strategy
 bijepi is daanv se jahaan saansad ke khilaaf kshetra main anti inakambency ko khatm karnaa chaahati he to vahiin sanjay gandhi kii raajnneetik viraasat par menka ke jariye majboot daavedaari karne jaisi kai vajah hai
 Strategies to eliminate anti-incumbency Maneka Gandhi is currently MP from Pilibhit and Varun Gandhi from Sultanpur
 donon netaa hai profile hone ke naate apane-apane kshetra main bahut zyada sakriy nahin rahe hai
 It is believed that there is an anti-incumbency against Maneka and Varun in the area
 itnaa hi nahin sultanpur main varun gandhi ke kareebi rahe chandrabhadra singh ne bijepi chhodkar basapa kaa daaman tham liya he or gathbandhan ke ummidavaar ke taur par taal thok rahe hai
 In view of this, BJP has converted the parliamentary constituency of the two leaders
 varun gandhi sultanpur ke bajaay apni maa kii paramparaagat seat pilibhit se chunavi maidan main ek baar phir kismat aajamaayenge
 Interestingly, when Varun Gandhi started his political innings in 2009, he was elected as an MP from Pilibhit and after 10 years is going to get off the same political ground once again
 sanjay gandhi kii viraasat par daawaabijepi ne menka gandhi ko pilibhit ke bajaay sultanpur seat se ummidavaar banane ke peeche unke pati sanjay gandhi kii viraasat par daawey ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 Sanjay Gandhi has been contesting from the Amethi parliamentary seat, a region that was once part of Sultanpur district
 isi maddenjar bijepi ne 2014 main varun gandhi ko sultanpur seat se utaara tha or party ko iskaa phayda bhi mila tha
 But they have not been able to gain much political mileage
 aise main bijepi ne menka gandhi ko sultanpur ke ran main utaara he, lekin dilachasp baat ye he ki congress ne sanjay gandhi ke mitra rahe dow
 Sanjay Singh has been fielded
 sanjay singh is seat se 2009 main saansad rahe hai, lekin 2014 ke varun gandhi ke chalate khud chunaav nahin ladane ke bajaay apni duusari patni amita singh aage kar diya tha
 Amidst reports of Varun Gandhi not contesting the election from Sultanpur, Sanjay Singh has hit the ground this time and the BJP has fielded Maneka Gandhi on this seat
 mana ja rahaa he ki menka ke jariye bijepi sahanubhuti batorkar sultanpur ke ran main camel khilaanaa chaahati he
 Safe Seat for Varun gandhimenka Gandhi was looking for a safe seat for his son this time
 isi maddenjar wo apni pilibhit seat se varun gandhi ko ladaane kii vakaalat karti raheen or khud haryana kii karnal seat chaahati thim
 The BJP accepted the decision to field Varun Gandhi from Pilibhit, but did not accept the condition of Karnal seat
 haalanki party ne pilibhit seat se varun gandhi ko utarkar unki raah ko aasaan kar diya he
 The Congress has already given this seat to its party as an alliance
 isse saaf he ki varun ke khilaaf sidhe taur par congress kaa koi ummidavaar nahin hoga
 Apart from this, Maneka Gandhi has been in the seat for a long time and Varun Gandhi himself has been elected as an MP from here in 2009
 iskaa bhi unhen raajnneetik phayda mil saktaa he
 Actor Imran Khan feels that the male actors of the film world are capable of challenging item numbers like Munni and Sheela
 imran ne kaha ki vah mjedaar item number karne ke bare main vichaar kar rahe hai
 He said, why should only girls get all the fun
 yadi mauka mila, to main bhi ek item number karuunga
 Just, it should be fun and like Munni Badnaam to force people to snort
 imran ne kaha ki jab unhone dely beli sin kii thi, to unhen nahin pataa tha ki aamir khan retro sangeet par aadhaarit tere pyaar ne kar diya divaana karenge
 Pakistan's military intelligence agency ISI is helping the Taliban in Afghanistan
 neuyark times ke hawaale se iskaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 The report says that the ISI is helping to expand the Taliban in southern Afghanistan
 report ke anusaar iesai talibani ladaakon ko paisa ke saath saath antarrashtriya sena se kaise ladaa jaae iske vishay main bhi prashikshan de rahi he
 The United States is going to send 17,000 troops to Afghanistan soon
 iesai ke chhadam es wing se talibani ladaakon ko nirdeshit kiya ja rahaa he
 The report even states that there have been talks between the ISI and the Taliban commander to spread violence ahead of elections in Afghanistan
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne satta main lautne ke baad ek baar phir se 'ek desh, ek chunaav' par charchaa shuru kar di he
 During the discussion on President Ram Nath Kovind's address to the Rajya Sabha, Prime Minister Modi once again spoke of 'one country, one election' and asked to prepare a 'voter list'
 modi ne kaha ki abhi tak kai jagah alag-alag matadaata suchi he, lekin ise hamen badalanaa chahie
 After all, Prime Minister Modi talks about the election, and how rational they look
 duniya ke sabase bade loktantr vaale desh bharat main har saal kahin na kahin chunaav hote hai, jisase aachaar samhita lage hone ke kaaran vikaas sambandhi kaaryon par asar padataa he
 Maintaining security in the area during the election is also a big challenge
 is kaaran baari suraksha balon kii tainaati bhi chunauteepurn hoti he
 a large number of government employees have to engage in election related work, which hinders government work
 chunaav ko lekar har tarah kii vyavastha main jan ke saath dhan bhi istemaal hota he
 It goes from the pocket of common people
 press information beuro or chunaav ayog kii ore se die gaye aankadon ke anusaar sirf loksabhaa chunaav main hi kharch ke bare main isse andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he ki 1952 ke chunaav main prati voter 60 paisa kharch aayaa tha, jo 2009 main 20 guna badhkar 12 rupye ho gaya
 The same expenditure per voter increased to Rs 42 in 2014
 2019 main mana ja rahaa he ki 6500 karod rupye kaa kharch aayaa
 On this basis, this expenditure per voter is 72 rupees
 ek saath chunaav karaane se kareeb 70 hajaar karod kii hogi bachat'ek desh ek chunaav' karwaane ke liye badi sankhya main iviem kii jarurat hogi
 12 to 13 lakh evms are used in a Lok Sabha election
 har saal 4-5 rajyon main hone vaale chunaav ke liye 2 se 3 lakh iviem kii jarurat hoti he
 If elections are held simultaneously in the country, then for this, evms need to be doubled from the present ie, 30 to 32 lakh evms will have to be arranged
 or phir itane hi VVPAT bhi lagaae jaaenge
 It will cost about 5 thousand crores more
 yah system lagu hone par desh main chunaav prakriya kaa samay bad jayega
 Voting stages may increase
 loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ek saath karaane par security par kharch kam hoga
 During every election, at least 5 security personnel are deployed at every polling booth, then there will be a reduction in the cost, because they have to be deployed only once
 centre for media studies (CMS) kii report kahati he ki is baar chunaav main raajnneetik dalon kii ore se kareeb 60 hazaar karod kharch kiye gaye hai
 Similarly, in the assembly elections of every state, political parties spent about 10-10 thousand crores
 2017 main uttar pradesh vidhansabha or 2018 main karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main 10 hazaar karod se zyada kaa kharch kiya gaya
 In this way 1 from the political parties in both elections
 20 lakh se 1
 It costs 40 lakh crores
 ab agar do kii jagah ek baar hi chunaav ho to kharch aadha ho jayega
 Also time will be saved
 5 saal main hue 37 bade chunavprail 2014 se desh main hue chunaavon kii baat karen to 2 baar loksabhaa chunaav ke alaava 35 rajyon or centre shasit pradeshon kii vidhansabhaon ke chunaav karaae gaye
 In 2014, in addition to the general elections, assembly elections were held in 8 states
 2015 main dilli or bihar jabaki 2016 main 5 rajyon or 2017 main 7 rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav karaae gaye
 The highest number of assembly elections were held in 9 states in 2018
 vahiin, is saal ab tak loksabhaa chunaav ke saath 4 rajyon main vidhansabha ke liye chunaav hue
 60 thousand crores spent: CMS In the beginning of June, the study of CMS revealed that in the 17th Lok Sabha election which lasted for 7 phases and 75 days, 60 thousand crores was spent alone
 yah duniya kaa sabase mahangaa chunaav sabit hua
 On an average, it is Rs 700 per vote
 kharch kiye gaye
 At the same time, an average of Rs 100 crore per Lok Sabha constituency for every parliamentary seat
 kharch kiye gaye
 CMS revealed that in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections held 5 years ago, Rs 30 thousand crore
 kharch hue the, jo 2019 main badhkar doguna ho gaya
 CMS claimed that 12 to 15 thousand crore rupees were spent in this election, 20 to 25 thousand crore rupees were advertised, 5 thousand to 6 thousand crore rupees were spent on logistics
 iske alaava 10 se 12 hajaar karod rupye aupchaarik kharch tha, jabaki 3 se 6 hajaar karod rupye anya madon par kharch hue
 In this way, this expenditure reaches between 55 and 60 thousand crores
 jabaki chunaav ayog se manyata praapt kharch kii vaid seemaa 10 se 12 hajaar karod rupye rakhi gai thi
 From 1952 to 2014, spending increased by 369 times, while spending on elections kept increasing
 chunaav jis teji se hitech ho rahe hai aise main chunaav ayog ke saamne nishpaksh or sucharu tareeke se chunaav karwaanaa behad pechida or kharchila ho gaya he
 From 1998 to 2019, the general election expenses in the last 21 years have increased by 6 to 7 times
 1998 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kharch kareeb 9 hajaar karod rupye tha jo ab badhkar 55 se 60 hajaar karod rupye tak pahunch gaya he
 Talking about the expenditure in the Lok Sabha elections, according to the Election Commission, 10 in the first Lok Sabha election held in 1952
 5 karod rupye kharch hue the
 Whereas the election of 1957 was the cheapest ever
 is chunaav main 5
 9 crore rupees were spent
 ab tak loksabhaa chunaav main hue kharch1952 -10
 5 crores 1957 -5

 On the issue of 'one country one election', Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his speech that elections have been improving since 1952 till date, but it is wrong to deny it today, it should be discussed continuously
 piem ne kaha ki samay kii maang he ki aaj kam se kam matadaata suchi or poling stesan ek hi hone chahie
 Spending on the same voter list will cut costs
 saal 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967 main ek saath loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke chunaav ho chuke hai lekin ye silsilaa 1968-69 main tut gaya
 According to the Law Commission, the new evms for Rs 4,500 crore would have to be purchased only in 2019 if elections were held simultaneously
 haalanki 2024 main ek saath chunaav karaane ke liye 1751
 17 crores will have to be spent only on evms
 pradhanmantri narendra modi 'ek desh ek chunaav' ke mudde par pichley dinon sabhi raajnneetik dalon kii baithak bhi bula chuke hai
 The way Modi is raising this issue, it seems that this matter will continue
 'ek desh ek chunaav' kii prakriya shuru hone se kharch main kaaphi katautee hogi or samay kii barbaadi bhi nahin hogi
 The expenditure in the Lok Sabha elections from 1952 to 2019 has increased more than 400 times
 aise main is par sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko vichaar karnaa chahie

 The specialty of Madhur's stories is that he wants to bring out the things that people often talk about in secret
 ab kya calendar girls ke saath madhur bhandarkar ko ek baar phir se darshak apanaayenge ? aaiye film kii samiksha karte hai
 Story: This story is about a girl from four different states of India and a Pakistan who has been selected as the 2014 calendar girls in Mumbai
 These girls are Nandita Menon (akanksha Puri) from Hyderabad, Mayuri Chauhan from Rohtak (roohi Singh ), Sharon Pinto (kiara Dutt) from Goa, Paroma Ghosh (satpura Pine) from Kolkata and Nazneen Malik (avni Modi) from Lahore
 ab in sabhi ladakiyon kii jindagi kis tarah se mumbai aakar badalati he, kin-kin halaaton se hokar inhen guzarana padataa he, iske bare main hi madhur ne apni baat kehane kii koshish kii he
 scriptfilm's script resembles that of a TV serial where this time Baadamdhur Bhandarkar has targeted calendar models
 madhur ne dikhaaya he kii kis tarah se calendar launch ke baad un modells kaa kariyar aage badhata he or kya-kya kathinaaiyaan saamne aati hai
 But this story seems unable to touch the emotions
 madhur kii is film main kahin naa kahin bahut si khamiyaan najar ai or lag rahaa tha kii jaldibaji ke chakkar main unhone kahani kaa mul kho diya
 The soul of Madhur, who used to wait impatiently to watch the film, did not appear in this film at all
 or agar koi bada star is film se judaa hota, to yah film kisi or level kii banati, 'fishan' tathaa 'pej 3' jaisaa jalawaa dikhaa paati
 In the acting film, each character has tried to act, there are some actresses who will not have to face any difficulty in getting work in the future because some parts looked good due to their presence
 ruhi singh, kiyaara dutt or avani modi kii acting thik he
 Madhur has also tried acting in some parts in the film, in the way he also played a small role in Rangeela, but his presence was also unable to take the form of a brahmastra
 sangitafilm main becoground main aane vaala geet kaaphi achchhaahai ,lekin film kaa koi bhi geet aisa nahin rahaa jo femes hua ho or film ke dauraan dil main ghar kar paaya ho
 Weak link The weakest link is the script of the film
 madhur bhandarkar ne ek hi vakt par match phixing, patrakarita, reality sho jaise vishyon par apni baat kehane kii koshish to jarur kii he lekin kabhi kabhi bahut kuch dikhaane ke chakkar main puri film dishaheen ho jaati he
 Viewers are eagerly waiting to see Madhur's darling, page 3, and fashion-level films, and 'calendar Girls' seems unable to get a good response to expectations
 kyon dekhegar aap edlt hai,madhur bhandarkarke diwane hai to hi is film ko dekhen

 haath din bhar kaam karte hai
 And what do we give to them in return
 
 
 laaparvaahee bhari dekhbhaal
 Just put some cream and it's done
 jabaki sach yah he ki haathon ko dekhbhaal kii utani jarurat hoti he, jitani aapke chehre ko
 In winter, hands are more dry than the rest of the body
 haathon kii twachaa kaaphi patali hoti he or isamen taileey grathinyaan bhi bahut kam hoti hai
 Housewives' hands frequently come in contact with soap and detergent during daily routine, which causes excessive damage to the skin of the hands and becomes dry
 nahaate samay haathon par tel kaa prayog karnaa chahie
 Applying body lotion and cream to the body immediately after bathing, maintains body moisture
 haathon kii sundarataa ke liye aursaundarya banaae rakhaneke aap in tips ko prayog main laa sakati hai
 - Massage the oil on the hands and feet before bathing, which increases the softness of the skin
 iske liye aap til yaa jaitoon kaa tel prayog main laa sakati he
 Make a paste by mixing gram flour, curd and turmeric and leave this paste for 20 minutes
 baad main ise halkaa sa ragaden or phir sade pani se dho len
 Repeat this process two or three times a week
 - shushk va saawali twachaa vaale haathon ke liye do chammach surajamukhi tel, 2 chammach neembu kaa ras or ek chammach khurdari chini milakar paste bana lijie
 Apply this paste on hands for 15 minutes
 phir halke haath se ragadkarhata den
 You can apply this paste three times a week
 - haath-pair kii twachaa kii atyadhik khushki se nipatane ke liye ek chammach glisreen ko 100 mili litre gulab jal main milaayein
 Applying this mixture on hands and feet adds moisture and softness to the skin
 - haathon ke rang ko saaf tathaa mulaayam karne ke liye thodi-si chini main neembu kaa ras milakar haathon kii twachaa par halke se maalish karen or baad main gunagune pani se haath dho len
 For more dry hands and nails, mix one spoon almond oil, one teaspoon sesame oil and one teaspoon wheat seed oil and make a mixture
 ise apni twachaa va nakhunon par roj lagaaein
 - Many medicinal properties are found in coconut oil
 twachaa ke infections kii jagah par agar nariyal tel kaa istemaal kiya jaae to yah jaldi thik ho jaataa he
 Applying it on hands makes the hands beautiful and ends the dryness of the skin
 - tej garm pani se haath ko nahin dhone chahie
 Actually, warmer and more cold water affects the humidity of hands
 saath hi tej garm pani se haathon kii twachaa ke jalane kaa bhi khatra bana rahata he
 Therefore, it should always be noted that only use lukewarm water
 - haathon kii suraksha ke liye is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie ki baahar nikalne se pehlehathon par sanscreen lotionaka istemaal jarur karen, taaki surya kii ultrawoilet kirnon kaa haathon par dushprabhav na pade
 - To give glow to the hands, apply fresh orange peel and grind
 isse ded skin hatane ke saath hi haathon kii twachaa kaa rang bhi saaf hoga

 ek jamaana tha, jab bollywood main sthapit abhinetriyaan item geeton ke naam par naak-bhun sikodti thim, lekin ab is silsile main unki hichak lagaataar dur ho rahi he

 The Central Reserve Bank has announced its sixth monetary review policy
 RBI ne repo rate 6
 5 minus 6
 25 pratishat kar diya he
 While reverse repo rate also reduced to 6
 00 pratishat kar diya gaya he
 The common man is going to get relief from the reduction in the repo rate, now the home loan interest rates will be cut
 empisi ke 6 main se 4 sadasyon ne repo rate main katautee ke faisle kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki viral acharya or chetan ghate repo rate main katautee ke paksh main nahin the
 The RBI says that the country's GDP growth in 2019-20 is 7
 4% rah sakati he
 While the inflation rate in the first quarter of 2019-20 3
 2, duusare main 3
 4% and 3 in the third half
 9 quarter tak rah sakati he
 Taking a big decision, the RBI has also increased the limit of loans to whom 
 ab bina kisi guarantee ke kisaanon ko 1
 Loans up to 60 lakhs will be available, earlier this limit was up to 1 lakh rupees
 iske liye jald hi notice jari kiya jayega
 In fact, in its bilateral monetary review, the central bank measures the repo rate and cash reserve ratio for all public and non-government banks in the country, measuring the current economic situation of the country and the challenges being faced by the global economy
 repo rate vah dar he jisapar desh kaa koi bank rigerv bank se kam avadhi kaa karj letaa he
 The repo rate determines the interest rates in the country on which the businessman and the general bank consumer get interest on the loan taken from the bank or deposits in the bank
 vahiin cash rigerv reshio kisi bank ke paas maujuud kul mudra kaa vah hissaa he jo kendriya bank ke adheen he
 By increasing this ratio, the Reserve Bank changes the liquidity and lending capacity of the bank in the market
 teen dinon tak chalane vaali baithak ke aakhri din hone vaale elaan par deshbhar ke kaarobaariyon kii najar isliye bhi rahati he ki vah maujuuda samay main mahangaai kaa akalan kis tarah kar rahaa he
 Apart from this, the central bank also works to advise the central government by assessing the impact of the ongoing and proposed schemes of the central government on the public exchequer
 gauratlab he ki beete kuch varshon ke dauraan kendra sarkaar or rigerv bank ke bich maudrik niti ko lekar vivaad saamne aae hai
 Due to these disputes, the former governors have spoken on the central government to preserve the autonomy of the Reserve Bank
 gauratlab he ki 1 farvari ko aae antarim bajet main kendra sarkaar ne pradhanmantri kisaan yojana kaa elaan kiya he
 Apart from this, we have decided to give income tax relief to the middle class
 jahaan madhyam varg ke liye kiye gaye tex elaan kaa asar nae vitt varsh main sarkari khajaane par dikhegaa vahiin kisaanon kii yojana ko maujuuda vitt varsh se hi shuru karne kaa prastaav diya gaya he
 Both of these schemes will have an impact on the revenue and expenditure of the central government, due to which the already challenging financial deficit can become more serious
 lihaaja, is chhathvin maudrik niti main logon kii najar is baat par bhi hogi ki kya rigerv bank vittiya ghate par koi tippanee karata he
 Read this 
 
 RBI kii maudrik niti kii baithak se pehle share bazaar main thodi maayusigauratlab he ki antarim bajet main kendra sarkaar ne anumaan diya he ki agle vitt varsh 2019-20 main guds and services tex se rajasav main 18 fisadi kaa ijapha hote hue lagbhag 7
 60 trillion (lakh crore)
 vahiin maujuuda vitt varsh main sarkaar ko ummid he ki vah jiesti rajasav ke lakshya ko paane main 1 trillian rupee se chook jaaegi
 Goal 7 of the Central Government for the current financial year
 43 trillian rupee rakhaa gaya tha lekin antarim bajet main ise badalakar 6
 43 trillion rupees is estimated
 jaahir he, isse kendra sarkaar kaa vittiya ghaataa sankat banane ke liye taiyaar he
 At the same time, the interim budget in revenue through income tax is estimated that 17
 2 fisadi ke ijaphe ke saath 6
 2 trillion
 vahiin maujuuda vitt varsh main 22
 Revenue has been estimated at 8 per cent higher
 vitt varsh 2017-18 main inakam tex se sarkaar ko kul 4
 Revenue of 3 trillion rupees was received
 lekin antarim bajet main kiye gaye praavdhaanon ko dekhen ko kendra sarkaar ne lagbhag 3 karod tex peyar ko ribet ke jariye raahat dete hue jiro tex karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The Central Government hopes that this relief will reduce its revenue to 68
 5 million rupee kaa nuksaan hoga
 Therefore, the challenge for the government is serious in this area of revenue
 ye bhi padhein
 
 
 Budget 2019: The money came from here and spent here in the government treasury, and the third party of the central government's revenue is also full of challenges
 kendra sarkaar apane vinievesh ke lakshya se dur khadi he
 The government is almost 55 per cent behind the disinvestment target of Rs 80,000 crore for FY 2018-19
 antarim bajet ke mutabik sarkaar ko maujuuda varsh main vinievesh ke jariye mahaj lagbhag 35 hajaar karod rupee mili hai
 Despite this, in the interim budget, the central government has expected revenue of 90 thousand crore rupees through disinvestment
 rigerv bank kii maudrik samiksha main aarthik jaankaron kii najar jahaan sarkaar ke lekha jokha par rahegi vahiin yah bhi dekha jayega ki kya chunavi varsh main kaarobaari teji ke liye kendriya bank chote or madhyam karobaari ke saath-saath madhyam varg ko byaaj daron main raahat kaa rasta saaf karegi?

 The party said in its complaint to the President that the Governor has said that he is a Congressman first
 yah apane aap main sabit karata he ki vah sakriy raajnneetik ke rup main is pad par aae hai
 The BJP alleged that as the constitutional head of the state, he is bound to accept the suggestion of the cabinet but Bhardwaj refuses to do so
 raajnneetik sankat kii ghadi main bhaajapa aalaa kaman yediurppa kaa puraa saath de rahaa he
 Before meeting the President, Gadkari lauded the 'good governance' of the Yeddyurappa-led government at the BJP headquarters here

 achaanak ek din jab uski maa mazdooree ke liye baahar gai or chote bhai-bahan skool gaye the, usee din raja naam ke shaks ne uske ghar main ghuskar jabaran balaatkaar kiya
 Due to the bullying of the rapist, she kept quiet and mistook her pain and went to Hyderabad in connection with livelihood

 The victim gave birth to the girl but she has come to Darbhanga from Hyderabad to get justice

 The Indian women's hockey team won a gold medal at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in England, while it won a silver medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Australia
 iske baad haalanki 2010 or 2014 main team paanchvaan sthaan hi hasil kar pai thi
 The team is as follows- Goalkeeper: Savita (vice-captain), Rajni Raksha Row: Deepika, Sunita Lakra, Deep Grace Ekka, Gurjeet Kaur, Sushila Chanu Pukharamambam Madhyam Row: Monica, Namita Toppo, Nikki Pradhan, Neha Goyal, Lilima Minjagrim Row: Rani (captain ), Vandana Kataria, Lalremsiyami, Navjot Kaur, Navneet Kaur, Poonam Rani rashtriya janata dal ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne bihar ke siem nitish kumaar ke haalia badale hue rukh ko lekar kaha he ki chuuhe jab jahaaj chhodane lagen to uske doobane kaa anumaan aap sahajata se laga sakate hai
 Shivanand Tiwari says that suddenly the socialist inside Nitish Kumar has woken up
 unhone ek bayaan main kaha he ki rajyasabha main lambit teen talaak vidheyak par unki party bijepi kaa saath nahin degi
 There has also been a statement from his side on the Ram temple
 mandir nirmaan maamle main ucchtam nyaayalay kaa faisla maanenge
 Will not support ordinance
 tiwari ne kaha he ki baat yaheen nahin rukati he
 In a program yesterday, he (nitish) said that everyone has the freedom to express his views and practice religion
 aage kehete hai ki aaj puri duniya or desh bhar main aapasi katutaa ko badhaane kaa maahaul paidaa kiya ja rahaa he
 But the only question is, why suddenly Nitish ji has started to bother this question? Because for the last three or four years fundamentalism has been creating tension in the Indian Constitution, democracy and the fabric of our multi-colored society
 unhone kaha he ki nitish ji naasamajh vyakti nahin hai
 They know that the bjp's mother organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, does not believe in the values of which Nitish ji is suddenly being harassed again
 sangh kii nitiyon or uske khatre ko ve acchhee tarah samajhate hai
 That is why they were separated from them with a resolve to create a union-free India
 'mitti main mil jaaoongaa lekin ab inke saath nahin jaaoongaa', is bhishma pratigya ke baad punah unke paas jane kii himmat unhone kaise juta lee! mahagathbandhan se alag hone kii vajah bhrashtachar vagairah kii unki baat to bematlab he
 Who knows this better than me
 shivanand ke kaha ki ram mandir yaa teen talaak par bhaajapa yaa unke longon kaa rukh nayaa to nahin he
 These people are pressurizing, threatening, the Supreme Court on the question of Ram temple
 yogi ne to taal thokkar kaha ki ayodhya main ram mandir tha, he or rahegaa
 The triple talaq case became illegal since the Supreme Court's decision
 lekin in logon ko isse santosh nahin hua
 In spite of being illegal, divorce will be tried by a criminal case against this method
 is par teen saal kii kaid kaa praavdhaan to kabhi kaa kar diya gaya tha
 But why has Nitish remained silent on all this till now? Tiwari has said that we had never felt the crisis like expression today, except during emergency
 lekin nitish ji is par maun vrath main rahe
 Even Ramachandra Guha, who once saw the prospect of Prime Minister in Nitishji, did not go to Ahmedabad seminar for fear of fundamentalists
 nasiruddin shah par kis dhang se hamalaa hua
 What did they say? He had expressed concern over the growing intolerance in the country
 unki ashanka ko un par hamalaavaron ne sachcha sabit kar diya
 But our Nitish ji remained neutral
 argedy netaa ne kaha ki aaj achaanak apane andar ke soe samaajawaadee ko unhone (nitish) jagaaya he to jarur uske peeche koi khaas vajah he
 If you see the time of this socialist awakening, it will be easy to understand
 paanch rajyon ke chunaav nattejey ne narendra modi or amit shah ke pachaas saal tak shashan karne ke darp ko chur kar diya he
 Nitish Kumar, who once declared Modi unbeatable, has also shocked these results
 ab tak vidhansabha ke un chunaav nateezon par unhone pratikriya nahin di he
 This same socialist statement has emerged after the results
 isse kya nishkarsh nikalataa he?nitish bahut chatur vyakti hai
 He has missed an assessment once
 narendra modi kaa raajnneetik avsaan itani jaldi hoga, iskaa anumaan ve nahin laga paae the
 In the election results of five states, he can see the sun setting in Narendra Modi's politics
 chuuhe jab jahaaj chhodane lagen to uske doobane kaa anumaan aap sahajata se laga sakate hai
 Nitish is now again changing the course of his politics
 ab bhrashtachar nahin kattarwad unako satayega
 If we get the guarantee of the Chief Minister's chair, Nitish ji will not take any time to retaliate to save democracy

 The Chief Minister told reporters, "imported urea of two months quota of Bihar was given to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and other states, which caused a great problem to the farmers of the state
 ’ unhone kaha ki rajg ke saansadon ne khaad ke is vishay ko pramukhataa se sansad main uthaaya or krishi mantralay ko saare dastavej ke saath tathy diye gayi to centre sarkaar ne is galati ko sweekaar kar liya
 The Chief Minister said that this time there is no drought like situation in the state and there is a lot of paddy and maize cover, so the demand for fertilizer has increased here
 ab cote kaa khaad bihar ko milegaa to sthiti main sudhaar hoga
 He said that from the Center, every moment with the interests of Bihar, there is frustration

 He said that the amount of water released from Bansagar reservoir in Son river increased to 8 lakh cusecs the day before yesterday, so water entered the areas along the river

 bhartiya mausam vibhaag (iemdi) ke dehradun sthit kshetreey centre ne 13 june ko samay rahete hi chetavanee de di thi
 The meteorological department predicted, 'heavy or very heavy rainfall may occur in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand within the next 48 to 72 hours
 ’ dilli yaa dehradun main aapadaa prabandhan kaa kaam karne vaali kisi bhi agency ne is chetavanee par dhyaan nahin diya
 As a result, the disaster managers of the country were sleeping in Uttarakhand on the night of June 16 when a sudden cloudburst triggered destruction
 iske pehle bhi vinaash kii chetavaniyaan di ja chuki thim
 In October 2012, the Disaster Mitigation and Management Center (DMMC) of Uttarakhand sent a 48-page report to the state cabinet
 agast, 2012 main aakasmik baadh or bhuskhalan kii ghatnaon ke baad assi ganga ghati main jaanchy sheershak vaali is report main uttarkashi main apekshaakrit choti aapadaa kii padtaal kii gai thi
 Heavy rain and accidental floods in that disaster had caused vehicular traffic and pedestrian crossing bridges, cutting the Gangotri valley from the rest of the world
 us tabaahi main 85 gaanv prabhavit hue the or 500 se zyada log rishikesh-gangotri rajmarg ke vibhinn hisson main funs gaye the
 29 people were killed and around 2,000 people were affected by the floods
 is report main is tarah kii aapadaa ko rokane ke upayon kii sifarish kii gai thi
 It also showed pictures of rescuing stranded villagers from Air Force Mi-17 helicopters
 report main chetavanee di gai thi ki bhavishya main isse bhi badi aapadaa aa sakati he, lekin is par kisi tarah kaa ehtiyaati kadam nahin uthaaya gaya

 shashidhar reddy ne mausam vibhaag kii 13 june vaali chetavanee ko saamaanya bulatin maanate hue khaarij kar diya
 He is a Congress MLA in Andhra Pradesh and has the status of a cabinet minister due to his post in NDMA
 is mridubhashi netaa ne kaha, ‘yah kisi bhi niyamit report jaisi hi thi
 There was nothing in it that we would get activated immediately
 ’is athurity kaa gathan 2005 main kiya gaya tha
 Its job is to prepare the country for disaster preparedness
 uttarakhand kii aapadaa ke samay is agency kii taiyaari itani kam thi ki haadase ke nau din baad ise hadabadi main honkong se 25 satellite phone mangane pade
 And that too when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is also the chairman of NDMA, intervened in the matter
 iskaa gathan 2004 main ai sunami ke baad kiya gaya tha, taaki bhavishya main aapadaa ke samay hone vaale nuksaan ko kam kiya ja sake
 The measures taken at the time of that tsunami were not satisfactory
 lekin ek asardaar sanstha hone kii bajaae isamen ritair ho chuke naukarshahon (sadsy ke rup main) ko bhar diya gaya, jinhen kisi kendriya rajyamantri ke baraabar suvidhaayen or bhatte milte hai

 Apart from the hefty salary, employees are provided with bungalows in the Lutyens zone of Delhi, a red-light car with driver, domestic help, free electricity and phone, but the money cannot make up for the inefficiency
 bachaav kaaryon ke bare main sawaalon ke jawaab dete samay reddy ekadam bephikr lag rahe the
 Sasidhar Reddy, son of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chenna Reddy, is the NDMA vice-president and recounts a wide range of stories to prove his closeness with the Prime Minister, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi

 ’endieme kii chaal se zyada gaur karne laayak rajya sarkaar kaa rukh tha
 On 15 June, when heavy rains started, there was a cabinet meeting in Dehradun that same evening
 rajya ke ek mantri kaa kahana tha, ‘varsha kaa koi zikr nahin hua or mausam vibhaag ne bhi koi chetavanee nahin di thi
 'there was no preparation or planning in advance
 misaal ke taur par logon ko haridwar or rishikesh main hi aage jane se roka ja saktaa tha
 On June 19, the Chief Minister of the state said in defense of his failure, “we had stopped all government flights
 par ham un ek lakh logon kii chaal kaise roak sakate the jo vahaan pahunch chuke the or sthaneey aabaadi kaa kya hota jinaki roji- roti chaar dham yatra se judi he
 'the real catastrophe occurred in the next two days i
e
 on 16 and 17 June, but the state government did not take the help of the army and paramilitary forces who are most capable of carrying out rescue operations
 rajya ke ek vidhayak kaa kahana he, ‘sena, bharat-tibet seemaa police, sashastr seemaa bal, rashtriya aapadaa karrwai bal (andiaref), seemaa sadak sanghathan, sab uttarakhand main tainaat hai, par unase koi madad nahin maangi gai

 vaayu sena ne 18 june ko bachaav kaa kaam shuru kar diya, lekin jin adhikariyon ko tainaat kiya gaya unke saath talmail ke liye rajya kaa koi pratinidhi nahin tha
 It took two days for the state government to set up a helpline center in Dehradun and it became operational on 19 June
 20 june ko kedaar ghati main raahat saamagree le ja rahe privet helicopter ke girane se pehali baar pataa chalaa ki bina talmail ke karrwai main kitna jokhim he

 Piyush Rautela, the former executive director of the organization, had said, "for this work, a detailed survey of the area should be done and areas more prone to danger should be identified
" ’ dmemasi kaa mukhiya rajya kaa pramukh sachiv hota he
 Despite the advice of the institution, no detailed survey was conducted about such areas
 uttarakhand sarkaar kaa record bahut kharaab he
 It has repeatedly failed to show readiness and understanding to deal with disasters
 rajya sarkaar nainital or musuri main do dopalar radar lagane ke liye mausam vibhaag ko jameen nahin de saki he
 The Central Government has allocated Rs
 12 crore from Weather Detection Systems of America
 main 12 dolpar radar kharide the, jinka makasad aapadaaon ke bare main pehle se chetavanee dene vaale sanketakon ko majboot karnaa he
 Two of these Doppler radars were approved for Uttarakhand in 2008
 inase badal ke banane ke saath-saath is bare main bhi pakki soochna milti he ki ek ghante main kitni millimetre barish hogi
 The Uttarakhand government has also been reluctant to give land to the NDMA to deploy a battalion of NDRF in the state
 is bal kii 10 batalian desh main aapadaa kii ashanka vaale alag-alag ilaakon main tainaat hai
 The NDMA had suggested that a battalion should also be deployed in the state as there is a risk of rocks falling, flooding and earthquake due to the weakening of the rocks
 grih mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne mana, ‘yah bal bachaav or raahat kaaryon ke liye hi bana he par iske sadasyon ko khaas kism kii training nahin milti
 After this tragedy in Uttarakhand, NDMA is thinking of getting approval for the Special Training Institute

 The nearest battalion of the NDRF was in Kolkata at the time of the 2011 earthquake in Sikkim

 a battalion was sent from Delhi instead
 endieme ko kam-se-kam apatsthiti main to vimaan kiraye par lene kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 'but informed sources say that the question is not just about the right to rent aircraft
 endieme ko apane karmchaariyon ko is tarah ke kaamon ke liye sangathit karne main maahir ek vyakti kii bhi jarurat he
 There is no one in this organization who decides to move employees from one place to another
 reddy ne saaf taur par mana ki endieme abhi khadaa ho rahaa he, ‘hamen sabhi aapadaaon se sabak seekhney hai

 He has also conducted mock drills all over the country
 endieme ke anusaar, bukamp ke khataron se nibatane kii taiyaari behad kamjor he
 Earthquake forecasting, like weather forecasting, is not yet accurate and its technology is evolving
 bharat ne 2002 se bukampiy khataron ke anuroop bhawan nirmaan ke niyam main sanshodhan nahin kiya he
 There are no rules yet to protect skyscrapers from earthquakes
 endieme 2013-14 main purvottar rajyon main jaagrukta or jaankaree kaa str badhaane par dhyaan dene ja rahaa he
 Sasidhar Reddy says, 'there have been earthquakes in the Himalayan belt already

 There was an earthquake in 1897 in Shillong

 Eight years after the devastating tsunami, there is no evidence that there has been a change in India's disaster management systems, when it should have happened
 -saath main kumaar anshuman a few days ago, a wall was suddenly formed on an important road leading out of a village in South Delhi, which is causing a jam in the area, as well as questions are being raised that have become an anecdote
 Of the road? darasal kalindi kunj se faridabad jane vaali sadak or mathura road ko jodne vaali link road aali gaanv ke thik baahar se guzarati he jiskaa istemaal aasapaas ke log dhadlle se karte rahe hai
 People are finding it difficult to erect a wall on this
 haalanki isaki vajah khastahal ho chukaa lohe kaa pul bataaya jaataa he, jise khatarnaak ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 People troubled by the jam said that this wall was built by the people of Ali village whereas according to the villagers, the wall has been made a precaution by the Irrigation Department of UP
 tippaniyan Whereas the Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Badarpur, whose people are troubled by the wall, are insisting that the villagers be held responsible
 lekin okhla vidhansabha jisamen ye gaanv padataa he, vahaan ke aap vidhayak gaanv waalon kii baat par muhar laga rahe hai
 Seeing two mlas of the same party standing across this wall, we went to the irrigation department office to know the truth
 upi sinchai vibhaag main assistant ejeeniyar narendra yadav ne bataaya he ki upi sinchai vibhaag ne gaanv ke baahar koi sadak nirmaan nahin karaayaa he
 Now there is a question as to how the wall was erected on the road without the consent of any government agency and that too without giving any alternative
 kahin ye sthaneey logon kii dabangai to nahin jo dusron ko apane ilaake se guzarane nahin dena chaahate
 Actually, the road from Kalindi Kunj to Faridabad and the link road connecting Mathura Road passes just outside Ali village, which has been used indiscriminately by the people around
 is par ab diwaar khadi hone se logon ko mushkil ho rahi he
 However, the reason for this is said to be a razed iron bridge, which has been declared dangerous
 jam se pareshaan logon ne kaha ki ye diwaar aali gaanv ke logon ne hi banavaai he jabaki gaanvvaalon ke mutabik diwaar upi ke sinchai vibhaag ne ehtiyathan banavaai he
 The comments jabaki aam aadmi party ke badarpur se vidhayak, jinke ilaake ke log diwaar se pareshaan hai, ve jor dekar iske gaanvvaalon ko jimmedaar tehra rahe hai

 ab aise main sawaal he ki bagaiyr kisi sarkari agency kii sahmati ke sadak par diwaar kaise khadi ho gai or wo bhi bina koi vikalp die

 Fog caused a painful accident in the Timarpur police station area of delhi

 Currently, both the bodies have been sent for post-mortem at the Sabzi Mandi Morchari
 postmortem report ke baad hi saaf ho paaegaa ki haadase kiasal vajah kohraor dhundh hi thi yaa phir chaalak kisi tarah kaa nasha kiye hue the
 Poisonous air continues to wreak havoc in Delhi for the past few days, which is why all agencies are discussing all measures to reduce pollution
 saath hi ise kam karne ke liye jaruri kadam bhi uthaae ja rahe hai
 When a person loves someone, he starts feeling relaxed
 use lagata he ki koi he jo uske har dukh-dard main uske saath khadaa rahegaa
 But sometimes things start to reverse instead of going right
 kisi bhirishte kii kamyabike liye jaruri he ki aap donon ek-duusare kii baaten samajhen lekin agar aisa nahin he to ekbar phir sochie, kya ye vahi shaks he jiske saath aap puraa jivan bitaana chaahati hai
 If you cannot find the answer, then consider these things, does your partner also do all these things: 1
 pyaar ke rishte main thodi-bahut jalan to chalati he
 a little irritation makes the relationship spicy, but it is like a salt that spoils the taste when it becomes too much
 agarapaka partner bahut adhikjalan karata he to ye aapke rishte ke liye acchhee baat nahin he
 2
 aapkaa partner aapke products or gols ke bare main kya sochataa he ? kya wo hi aapke liye saare faisle letaa he or aapako kya karnaa chahie kya nahin karnaa chahie, wo hi tay karata he? jo rishta aapako robot bana de, usase jitani jaldi alag ho jaaie, utana behatar he
 3
 aise partner sabase khatarnaak hote hai jinhen ye baar-baar yakeen dilaane kii jarurat hoti he ki aap usase pyaar karti hai
 You can do anything you want, but it is impossible to convince a person with insecurity of love
 4
 It is also very difficult to live with someone who expects perfection in everything
 jaruri nahin ki aap kaa comfort jone uske parfections ke hisaab se sahi hi ho lekin aise log har baat par kamiyaan nikaalte hai, jisase pyaar kaa rishta bhi boj ban jaataa he
 5
 agar aapkaa partner bhautik sukhon ko lekar kuch zyada hi active he to behatar he ki aap usase alag ho jaaen
 Nothing is good and such people start paying more money than relationships in life after a time
 6
 If anything goes wrong on your partner, then it is better that you say it bye
 aise log gaiyr-jimmedaar or kamjor hote hai, jo apni galati sweekaar karne se darate hai
 Making allegations is the easiest thing for them
 aisa karke wo khud ko surakshit mahasoos karte hai
 7
 agar aapako yakeen he ki aapkaa partner aapse jhooth bolta he to jitani jaldi ho sake aap usase alag ho jaaen
 Lies, whether small or big, are lies and this is enough to make any relationship hollow

 railway kii premium train or flixi fere skim lagbhag flop sabit ho rahi he
 In the name of premium, the bus is being robbed in the fare and no one seems happy with it
 isliye achraj kii baat nahin ki railway ne pichley saal diwali se pehle 47 trainon main flixi fere skim ko khatm kar diya tha
 Railways has initiated a change in this regard
 dekhnaa yah he ki vitt mantri iske bare main aage kadam uthaate hue bajet main kya ghoshnaa karti hai?vitt mantri ke saamne yah santulan banane kii chunauti he ki railway kii inakam bhi bade or janata ke liye yatra karnaa kifayati bhi bana rahe
 So it remains to be seen if the Flexi Fair system will be completely shut down? Or will this system be drastically changed to make it beneficial to the public? On September 9, 2016, the Indian Railways introduced the Flexi Fair scheme for premium trains
 inamen 44 rajdhani, 52 duranto or 46 shatabdi gaadiyaan shaamil thim
 Due to this scheme, passengers have to pay a lot of money for tickets in premium trains
 ise lekar railway ne rail mantri piyush goyal ko ek prastaav diya he
 If this proposal is approved, the fares of premium trains will also be reduced significantly
 kya he flixi fere systamshatabdi, rajdhani, duranto express jaisi kareeb 100 trainon main flixi fere system skim lagu he
 After 10 per cent of the tickets booked in the scheme, the ticket fare increases in the same proportion
 flixi fere system ko pehle iske tahat AC-III class main 140% kaa tarriff cap, jabaki akjicutive samet baaki sabhi class ke liye tarriff cap 150% tay kiya gaya tha
 The CAG criticized the railways' Flexi Fair in a report by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG)
 isamen kaha gaya he ki flixi fere system lagu hone se rail yatri hawaii safar kii taraf mud gaye he, jo ki train kii tulana main zyada suvidhajanak he, vahiin kuch yatri mail or express train main yatra kar rahe hai
 This was done in the Flexi Fare scheme
 These were the first benefits of the Flexi Fare scheme amendment by Badlaverailway in March, 2019 for those traveling in premium trains
 railway ne yatriyon ko raahat dete hue salbhar main 50 pratishat se kam booking vaali 15 premium railgadiyon par se flixi kiraaya yojana ko samaapt kar diya
 In less demanding seasons, when the ticket booking decreases from 50 to 75 percent, flexi fare scheme will not be applicable in 32 such trains
 in 32 trainon main farvari, march or agast main flixi kiraaya nahin lagegaa
 In addition, the railways has increased the flexi fare rate in 101 trains to 1 of the base price
 5 guna ke bajaay 1
 4 times
 is system main itane badlaav karne pad rahe hai ki ise vifal hi mana ja saktaa he
 It is obvious that the railways will have to find other sources to increase their income, instead of making loot-like arrangements in the name of premium fares

 Under his influence, a person indulges in sin despite not wanting to
 shani, rahu or ketu paap grah kii shrenee main aate hai
 Effect of Sin planets- In astrology, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu have been considered as sin planets
 - ye grah jivan ko paap kii ore le jate hai
 - Under the evil influence of Papagrahs, a person sins even without will
 - lekin kabhi-kabhi yahi paap grah bahut shubh ho jate hai
 - In auspicious conditions, these sinful planets lead man to virtue and salvation
 shani ke shubh or ashubh prabhaav -jis par shani kaa paap prabhaav padataa he uskaa kisi bhi kaam main man nahin lagata
 But when Shani gives merit, then the person becomes a welfare of himself as well as the society
 - shani kaa dushprabhav hone se insaan aalsee , laaparvaah or kathor hota he- insaan kshudra devataaon kii upasna karne lagata he
 - Man does not live cleanly and does bad deeds
 - shani ke shubh parinaam se insaan anushaasit ho jaataa he
 - Attracts to God by meditation and religion
 - shani ke shubh fal se insaan logon ko sachai or achchhai kii raah dikhaata he
 How to increase the auspicious effect of Shani - To increase the auspicious effect of Shani, worship Hanuman ji
 - apni kshamta ke anusaar bhojan, vastra or dhan kaa daan karen
 Effects of Rahu - According to astrology, Rahu is the second effective sin planet
 jis insaan par rahu kaa paap prabhaav padataa he vah jhooth, dhokhaa, chal or kapat jaisi buree aadaton kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 This sin planet also sometimes becomes auspicious
 - ashubharahucharitra patan or nashe kii ore le jaataa he
 - Rahu gives man the habit of conspiring and harassing others
 - rahu kii vajah se insaan dharm or aadhyatm ke khilaaf bolta he
 - If Rahu has an auspicious effect, then a person is proved from birth
 - aise insaan main adbhut chamatkaari shakti hoti he
 - In such a situation, man finds a new path of spirituality
 kaise badhayen rahu kaa shubh prabhaav -- rahu kaa shubh prabhaav badhaane ke liye satvik aahaar grahan karen
 - Worship Shiva
 - rogiyon or viklangon kii seva karen
 Effects of sin planet Ketu - In astrology Ketu has been considered as sin planet
 ketu kharaab ho to insaan ko disha se bhatka detaa he
 It causes sin
 lekin kabhi–kabhi yah grah bhi aapke liye bada shubh fal dene vaala hota he
 Due to Ketuka's inauspicious effects, man becomes antagonist against religion and God
 - manushya jivan kii har samasya ke liye ishwar ko jimmedaar tehraata he
 - Inversely, it becomes mentally imbalanced
 - ketu kaa punya prabhaav tirth yatraaen karwaata he
 - Gives the man a master and makes him a saint
 - ketu ke punya prabhaav se adbhut va aadhyatmik shakti milti he
 - The auspicious effect of Ketu also gives salvation and salvation to man
 ketu kaa shubh prabhaav badhaane ke upaay -paap grah ketu se pareshaan hai to uske shubh prabhaav badhaane ke upaay karen
 Then this Ketu will bring happiness in your life - worship Lord Ganesha by bathing daily
 - tirth sthanon or mandiron kii yatra karen

 The idea of how high ranking former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was, it seems that everyone is feeling a special connection with him
 koi unke saath apni tasviren ko yaad kar rahaa he to koi unke shahar se hone ko garv kaa vishay maan rahaa he
 Click here to pay tribute to Atalji TV Queen Ekta Kapoor has also described her Balaji Telefilms special connection to Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 unhone apane twit main likhaa, "bahut saal pehle atalji ne apane bhaashan main sakaaratmak dhang se balaji ke naam kaa ullekh kiya tha
 When my grandmother read about this, she hugged me for 10 minutes
 apane netaa ko log itnaa pyaar karte the
 Today i understand the meaning of his departure
 ham aapako yaad karenge atalji
 May your soul rest in peace
 "many years ago Atalji had mentioned balaji in a positive way in one of his speeches my grandmom read it n hugged me for ten minutes ! That’s d love they had for their leader!

 " Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar left for Mumbai from USA late Wednesday for treatment of pancreatic cancer
 parrikar ke kareebi sutron ne kaha, "mukhyamantri raat 1
 Left for the US with a 30 o'clock flight, he is expected to return in a week
 "rajya main congress ne bhaajapa kii aguwai vaali gathbandhan sarkaar ke mantriyon ke gambhir bimariyon se jujhane ke kaaran rajya sarkaar ko barkhaast karne ke liegowaki rajyapal mridula sinha se apil kii he
 In the absence of Parrikar, there is a confusion on the basis of rank among the Bharatiya Janata Party as well as coalition partners on 'alternative arrangements' on Wednesday
 haalanki, kendriya aayush rajya mantri va uttari goa se saansad shripad nike ne buudhvaar ko samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki vah vaikalpik vyavastha taiyaar karne ko lekar rajya kii kor samiti ke sadasyon ke saath party ke pramukh amit shah se mulaakaat karenge
 The Chief Minister's office was later forced to issue a statement that Parrikar himself would oversee the functioning of the coalition government from the US
 bataa den ki parrikar advanced panecriatic cancer se jujh rahe the, kareeb 3 maheene tak vah ilaaj ke liye america main hi the
 Significantly, Parrikar was admitted to Lilavati Hospital on 15 February this year, where he was treated for a pancreatic ailment

 Even after Rahul Gandhi's rebuke, the Union minister elected from Uttar Pradesh is not taking the name of Sudharne
 party kii aantarik report main saaf kaha gaya he ki mantri zyaadaatar samay dilli main bitaate hai or kaaryakartaaon ke kaam nahin karte
 After this, Rahul Gandhi has asked all ministers to visit different areas at least twice a month
 rahul gandhi khud to apane raibareli or amethi kshetra main gum-gum kar logon kaa haal puch rahe hai lekin jin mantriyon ko rahul ne dilli main satta saunpi wo usee main kho gayi
 UP in-charge of the party, Maghsudan Mistry, has visited the state and submitted a report, which clearly states that ministers do not work for the people
 is report ke hisaab se mantri zyaadaatar samay dilli main bitaate hai or rajya kaa daura nahin karte
 Ministers only go from where they have come, and not to the rest of the state
 kaaryakartaaon kii shikaayat he ki mantri kaam nahin karte, karte bhi hai to sirf apane chunaav kshetra se
 It is not good behavior to go to the ministers' house in Delhi, many times they do not meet even after waiting for hours
 is report ko lekar rahul gandhi naaraaz hai, unhone mantriyon kii class bhi lagaai
 Now all ministers will be given charge of at least ten districts in different zones, where they will spend two days in each district and diagnose the problems of workers
 uttar pradesh se kendriya mantri ke taur salmaan khurshid kshetra kaa bahut kam daura karte hai
 Either living in Delhi or abroad, very few people meet
 shri prakaash jaiswal keval kanpur kaa hi daura karte hai, kahin or kaa nahin
 The work is done only for the people of their area and not the people of the rest of the state
 benny prasad verma jo ki puraane samaajwaadiyon ke hi kaam karte hai
 Beni Babu does not have much attachment with Congress workers, and he only visits his area
 rajya mantriyon main par najar daalen topradip jain aditya se kaaryakarta kaam naa hone se naaraaz hai
 Jains promote some of their favorites
 sirf apane ilaake kaa hi daura karte hai
 RPN Singh, less visits the state
 kaaryakartaaon kii shikaayat he ki unke kaam nahin karte
 Jitin Prasad pays attention to his own locality
 duusare ilaakon ke kaaryakartaaon ke kaam kam karte hai, milte hai lekin kaam nahin hota
 Even after this, the party's condition in the assembly elections had become thin
 ab rahul ne sabko kaam par laga diya he
 It has also been said in Mistry's report that there are many complaints from people not only about the minister but also about the mps
 agar samay rahete ye nahin sudhare to lene ke dene pad sakate hai
 The last time 21 mps from Uttar Pradesh were won
 inke chalate party ko acchhee badhat mili thi
 Actually, Rahul wants to keep the figure of at least 22 in Uttar Pradesh, but the real question is why Rahul has been missing all this for so long that the ministers do not work even though these complaints are four years old

 Tata has been ordered to investigate this
 saath hi dilli sarkaar ne ye bhi saaf kar diya he ki agar is tarah kii ghatana phir hui to nateeja company ko bhugatna hoga
 At present, a depot incharge has been suspended in this case
 motinagar fliover ke paas lo floor bas main lagi is aag main kahin dilliwaalon kaa sapana khaak naa ho jaae kyonki ye wo hi lo floor bas he, jisane dilli main saarvajanik parivahan kaa huliya badal diya he, lekin is bas ko bhi kisi kii najar lag gai he
 This low floor bus of DTC was going from Janakpuri to Inderlok with about fifteen passengers but when the bus number 832 reached Motinagar, the bus caught fire after a loud explosion
 aag lagate hi musafiron main afratfari much gai or driver ko jab tak kuch samaj main aata bas kaa ingine band ho gaya, daravaaje jam ho chuke the
 High flames of fire were rising from the rear of the bus where the CNG cylinders are kept
 driver ne sooyeeboojh dikhaate hue sabhi savaariyon ko driver seat kii bagal ke daravaaje se baahar nikaal liya
 After this, three trains of fire brigade reached the spot to control the fire but by the time the team of fire brigade could control the fire
 puri bas khaak ho chuki thi
 Low floor buses are another name of comfort for Delhiites
 chadhane main aasaani, chalati bas main aaraam kaa ehsaas or kiraaya aam bason ke baraabar lekin jisane bhi aag ke is manjar ko kareeb se dikhaa uske hosh ud gaye
 Everyone had the same question on the tongue, what if the bus was packed at the time of the accident? maah kii shuruyaat main jab mahendra singh dhoni ke netritv main yuva khilaadiyon se las team india jab zimbabwe ke liye ravaanaa hui thi to kisi ne ummid nahin kii thi ki mukaable is had tak ekatarfa honge
 Although no one doubted Dhoni's brigade victory in the ODI series, it was being speculated that almost entirely Nainvelli could force this team into Zimbabwe 'tough match' except Dhoni
 baharhaal yah anumaan puri tarah galat niklaa or zimbabwe ke khilaadiyon ne teenon maichon main is tarah tashtaree main rakhkar team india ko jeet saunp di maano mehmaanon kaa 'swaagat' kar rahe hon
 After such a weak performance, the anger of Zimbabwean fans can be justified to an extent
 yah sahi he ki zimbabwe or team india ke khilaadiyon ke str main jameen-aasmaan kaa fark he, lekin akharane vaali baat yah rahi ki mejabaan team ke kisi bhi khilaadi ne sangharsh kaa jajba nahin dikhaaya
 In this case, the batsmen should be held more innocent than the bowlers, who did not learn a lesson from old mistakes
 inhone apane gendbaajon ko vah score hi nahin diya jo kisi bhi sthiti main dephend karne ke laayak ho
 The comments aamtaur par match dar match kisi team ke pradarshan main sudhaar aata he, lekin zimbabwe team iskaa apwaad rahi
 His performance declined with every match
 pehle match main jahaan mejabaan team kisi tarah 168 ran tak pahunchi to duusare or tisare vanade main to 150 kaa aankada choona hi uske liye mushkil ban gaya
 In the second ODI, the team was piled on 126 and in the third on 123 runs
 antim do vanade kii yah ransankhya is myne main adhik 'dayaneey' maani jaaegi ki 100 ran tak zimbabwe team ke mahaj teen wicket hi gire the, lekin madhya or nichle kram ke ballebaajon ne gairjimmedaarana ravaiya apanaaya or team 200 ran ke aasapaas tak nahin pahunch saki
 India was sure to get a big win on such a low run
 dhoni brigade ne pehla match 9, doosraa 8 or teesraa 10 wicket se jeeta
 After 'wiping out' Zimbabwe in the ODI series, Team India is now eyeing T20
 swaabhaavik he ki maansik rup se nichle str par pahunch chuki zimbabwe team ke liye aage kii raah bhi 'kaanton' se bhari he
 
 
 
 itane kamjor pradarshan ke baad zimbabwe ke prashansakon ke gusse ko ek had tak jaij hi tehraaya ja saktaa he
 It is true that there is a difference of ground-level between the players of Zimbabwe and Team India, but what is surprising is that none of the players of the host team showed the spirit of the struggle
 is maamle main gendbaajon ke mukaable ballebaajon ko zyada kusuuravaar tehraaya janaa chahie, jinhone puraani galatiyon se sabak nahin siikhaa
 He did not give his bowlers the score which is worth defending in any situation
 tippaniyan Typically, a team's performance improves from match to match, but the Zimbabwean team is an exception
 har match ke saath uske pradarshan main giravat hi ai
 In the first match, where the host team somehow reached 168 runs, it became difficult for them to touch 150 in the second and third odis
 duusare vanade main team 126 or tisare main 123 ran par dher ho gai

 Typically, a team's performance improves from match to match, but the Zimbabwean team is an exception
 har match ke saath uske pradarshan main giravat hi ai
 In the first match, where the host team somehow reached 168 runs, it became difficult for them to touch 150 in the second and third odis

 uttar pradesh ke bulandshahr main hinsa ke dauraan inspector subodh kumaar singh kii hatya maamle ke main ek or aaropee kalava ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 It is being told that Kalwa is the same person who attacked Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh with an ax after the violence spread

 Two out of the three suggested by the Naxalites have refused to mediate on their behalf
 varisht vakil prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki jab tak chhattisgarh ke jila colector elex paul menon unke bandhan main hai vah unki ore se madhyasthata nahin kar sakate, vahiin janajaatiy netaa manish kunjam ne raajnneetik kaaran bataae
 The Naxalites on Monday evening sought mediation on their behalf for Supreme Court lawyer and prominent member of Team Anna Prashant Bhushan, former chairman of the National SC / ST Commission
 di
 Sharma and Manish Kunjam, President of All India Adivasi Mahasabha, were further named
 kunjam ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unke faisle ke peeche raajnneetik kaaran or sthaneey paristhitiyaan hai
 He said, 'there are two more names in the list
 ham vyaktigat rup se in logon se madhyasthata karne kaa anurodh karte hai or ham unhen har tarah kii sahaayta denge
 Bhushan said he justified the Naxalites' demand to release innocent tribes and end Operation Green Hunt, but would not mediate on their behalf as long as they would hold Menon hostage
 bhushan ne haalanki kaha, 'vah nirdosh ke jivan ko bandhak banaakar madhyasthata nahin kar sakate
 He said, "they should release Menon unconditionally and after that if they want me to mediate with the government on their behalf, i will
 'sirf sharma ne kaha ki vah vaarta ko aage badhaane ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin unhone kaha ki vah pehle rajya sarkaar kii pratikriya jaananaa chahenge
 Sharma said, 'yesterday midnight i came to know that my name is in the list
 vaarta ko aage badhaane ke liye kisi ko aage badhanaa hoga
 But i would like to know the reaction of the state government

 He was talking to the tribals in the forest area on Saturday, when the Naxalites abducted him at gunpoint
 naksaliyon ne unke do surakshakarmiyon ko goli maar di thi
 When i went to Sirsa in 2004 to watch the drama of the charity of Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS), the theatricality of Ram Rahim's Gurugiri was revealed
 main jis satsang main gaya tha, vahaan un dinon mashhoor hindi gaanaa balle-balle jor-jor se baj rahaa tha or gane ke bich main hi guru ram rahim ne entry lee
 He was accompanied by a small deer
 alag-alag umr ke bhakt use dekhte hi khadey ho gaye or matvaale hokar naachne lage, puure samay ve apni ungaliyon or haathon se guru kii taraf ishaara kar rahe the
 As soon as the Guru ascended his throne, his palanquin moved forward and then moved at a certain speed, perhaps on a railway track
 vah shahi andaaj main bheed ke bich se nikal rahi thi, taaki dur khadey bhakt bhi kareeb se unka darshan kar saken
 In this way everything was happening there in film style
 lekin bahut baar dekha ja chukaa bollywood kaa drama dses ke veshyavriti unmoolan kaarykram (jisamen deraa ke bhakton kii ore se veshyaaon se shaadi karnaa shaamil tha) dekhne ko mila
 Apart from this, some other spectacle is also seen such as its global plan ("soon the day will come when the true deal will be named on the tongue of every child in the world") and regular exaggerations (a miraculous giant, wonder, washing machine
 kya kamaal kii cheez he
 The students at Dhobi Sacha Sauda hostels request, Huzur Maharaj ji, and the Guru instructs about this miraculous washing machine which has a capacity to wash 1,000 clothes simultaneously in half an hour)
 tom ganing ke idia ''aakarshan kaa cinema" jo shuru ke daur main cinema kii photography main vishesh prabhaav or takneekee kii takat ko dikhaata he, se udhaar lete hue ham kah sakate hai ki dses ne ''aakarshanon kii aasakti" ke vichaar ko janm diya he
 This special influence of Mayaism and Bhakti of Guru was the only means to attract devotees
 darshak or bhakt kii bhoomikaaon ko ek saath jod liya jaataa he or jaisaa ki maanav vigyaani bergit meyar bataate hai, tamaashon ko chamatkaar ke rup main pesh kiya jaataa he
 Given that DSS was already obsessed with attractions, it was no surprise — when rumors of the first installment of MSG: Messenger of God emerged
 bharat kii film industry main bhakthi or puranic filmon kaa bhi apana ek acha-khaasaa sthaan he
 MSG, perhaps for the first time, merged the feature film and the genre of devotional and mythological film into one: the music of the feature films, dance and song, and the spice of action were used in full swing, and with the help of exaggerations, the Guru got all Shown treating social evils
 iske alaava is film or uski agali kadigoon main guru ko jaani-pahachaani chhavi se alag ek nae rup main dikhaaya gaya jisamen vah khud ek nayak kii bhoomika main tha
 Everyone knows that some film stars, especially in South India, are worshiped — sometimes inside a cinema hall
 yahaan hamen iskaa ulataa dikhaai detaa he—vah aadmi jisaki pehle hi puja kii jaati he or phir vah film star ban jaataa he
 We talk about the film Jai Santoshi Maa (1975), which created a rage with immense success and after which new rules of worship were started
 lekin kis tarah kii dharmik bhakthi ke chalate ems kaa nirmaan hua? or kya ab yah barbaad ho chuki he?idhar is guru ke bare main media kii khabaren atyant sansanikhej rahi hai—yah shaayad us guru ke liye ke liye uchit hi tha jisaki dikhavebaaji media ke liye pehle se hi ek bharpoor masala thi
 Apart from the rape cases in which he has been found guilty, he was also accused of ordering the castration of hundreds of devotees
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki ek mardaangi vaala vyakti apane aasapaas sex main kisi tarah kaa pratidwandvi nahin chahta
 Along with this, he is also accused of having a physical relationship with the adopted daughter Honeypreet and having sex addiction
 in maamalon main media ne donon ko bilkul naepan ke saath pesh kiya he
 Impotence of devotees and in matters of devotion, sex is not unique
 udhaaharan ke liye peter vine da vir ne apni kitaab gods on arth main aise ''tyaagiyon" se milane kaa ullekh kiya he jinhone brahmacharya kaa paalan karne ke liye badhiya karvaa liya tha
 Daniel Gould has also told in his book Comprehending the Guru that corruption starts in matters of devotion when human relationship with God is weakened
 dses ke guru ke maamle main bhi aisa hi hua he
 But it should also be remembered that an intimate relationship with the Guru can also be seen as a spiritual uplift
 inamen koi bhi kaaran dses guru kii karatuuton kaa bachaav nahin kar saktaa
 Likewise, when Ram Rahim began to progressively play roles from guru and philanthropist to pop star and then film artist, and he came to be called the "gurus of glitter", the media presentation suggested that he might be snapping - He is the first Guru to wear flared clothes and jewelery
 unke rang-birange kapade ho saktaa he, anokhe lagate hon lekin utyub par satya sai baba ke video dekhne par pataa chalata he ki ve bhi isi tarah ke chamak-damak vaale kapade, aabhushan or ghadibhan pahananaa pasand karte the
 Such Baba people have been wearing rings and other jewelery (termed miraculous) for a long time and have been advising the devotees to remove various problems or cure diseases
 (tarah-tarah ke ratnon or neelam kii angoothiyon ke saath jyotish bhi chamak-damak se judaa he) ram rahim naatakeeyata vaale pehle guru bhi nahin hai
 In his book Mad and Divine, Sudhir Kakkar has described how Rajneesh (aka Osho) was dressed like an actor before appearing to his devotees
 aage chalakar ve mechap karne lage the, keemtee choga pahante the or jawaharaat se jade cap lagaate the, jinase unka ganjaapan chup jaataa tha
 Mata Amritanandamayi also often forms the goddess
 guru banane ke liye alag tarah ke kapade pahananaa bahut ahm he
 It is certainly an important tool for coming as a Guru
 mana jaataa he ki karishma vah cheez he jo aap nahin kar sakate hai
 But charisma was not the only qualification of DSS Guru Gurmeet Ram Rahim, he also had the distinction of more than one political party in return for the votes of his devotees
 unke kai or bhi hatkande the
 One of them was also a work of charity or philanthropy
 khayraat lambey samay se pratishtha dilaane kaa bada saadhan rahi he, or maine apni kitaab vence of divotionah blad donneton and rilijiyas experions in north india main likhaa he ki dses ke paropkaaree kaary—jaise ek din main sabase zyada unit raktadan karne kaa giness book of world main naam darj hona, ankhon kii jaanch kaa ab tak kaa sabase bada shivi lagaana, or mahatvapurn angon tathaa puraa sharir daan karne kaa pran karnaa aadi—media kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye the, taaki unki chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchane vaali kahaniyon ko chupaaya ja sake
 (though his devotees were doing all this work but the credit was being given to the Guru, the Guru's world record, which brought him fame worldwide, became the capital of his control over the body of the devotees
 ) isliye 2007 main jab ram rahim ne khud ko guru govind singh ke rup main pesh karne kaa prayaas kiya to sikhon ne uskaa jamkar virodh kiya tha lekin unke bhakton ne tab unke paroapkaar vaale kaamon kaa hawala dete hue unhen sachcha sant bataaya tha or kaha tha ki unki ninda nahin kii jaani chahie
 To vindicate this, the DSS organized blood donation camps to protest the attacks on its camp, and in August when the time came for the Guru to be sentenced, his lawyers urged the court to take his philanthropic actions into consideration Be soft with them
 keval paroapkaar ke kaary hi dses kii uplabdhi nahin the
 There is no doubt that it has truly helped people — especially giving free medical care to devotees — and its devotees have also played roles of doing something for others, making their Guru's personality larger
 unhone bhi apane guru kaa anusaran karte hue samaaj ko kuch dene ke liye apana haath aage badhaayaa he taaki unke guru kaa naam fail sake
 You could say that the gift of the Guru to the financially weak devotees was to make them donors
 yahaan ham ''bhaj" yani ''hissaa lenaa" se bhakthi kii vyutpatti kaa ullekh kar sakate hai
 Fake, hypocritical, hypocritical
 ram rahim ko jail hone ke baad (or isse pehle bhi kuchhek baar) inhen shabdon se nawaja gaya he
 We are not defending them, but their other actions should not be denied
 unhen bilkul farji baba kahana sahi nahin hoga (ve shaayad bahut bure guru hai)
 He was (is) a good guru to millions of devotees
 aakarshanon kii unki bhakthi kii atishyokti khud hi sachaai bayaan karti he
 Let us consider three aspects of the technicolor form of his Gurugiri technique
 pehla, unki vivaadit poshaak or 2007 main guru govind kii nakal yah dikhaati he ki kis tarah ek ''sarvamaanya" guru banane ke liye purv ke guruon or anya divya roopon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 There are many tricks to achieve this
 ek guru jo khud ko shiridy ke sai baba kaa avatar hone kaa daawa karata he use unke haav-bhav ko apnaanaa hoga or uski veshbhusha pehle vaale guru ke mukaable zyada karishmai rakhni hogi
 The son of a guru who has died recently may have to speak some of his father's words to show that his father's soul is present within him
 jo guru nakal karke logon kaa bharosa jeetne main safal ho jate hai unhen chalbaaj ke rup main nahin yaad kiya jaataa he
 There has been an Indian tradition of taking the form of a guru who is not a guru in himself
 doosraa, ram rahim kii sarahadein paar karne kii ichha, keval, sant se siio, saamaajik kaaryakarta, paropkaaree, pop star, film abhinayta vagairah ban janaa, or paaramparik shishtachar tathaa dharm kii seemaa langhna—darshata he ki guruon main alag-alag bhoomikaayen nibhaane kii ichha baithi rahati he, jo usko apane fan main maahir hone main madadgaar hi banate hai
 In the same way, we can understand this Gurugiri better
 haalanki unke kuch duusare pahaluon kii charchaa kii ja sakati he, jisase unki abha saaf hogi
 Finally you can ask about the teachings of Ram Rahim
 ve standard or ausat kism ke bhi hai
 He was never discussed in the media after he was sentenced and even before that
 ham phir se aakarshan kii bhakthi ke vichaar ke bare main baat karte hai kyonki guru hone ke unke sandesh ko hameshaa hi unke dikhaavon ke kaaran dabaa diya gaya
 In the end, as we know, excessive discussion on them led to a hidden side
 unhone aakarshan kii bhakthi ko itnaa adhik vistaar de diya tha ki vah media kii najar se itani jaldi hatane vaala nahin he

 In Davos, Switzerland, Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the annual conference of the World Economic Forum has also presented an ambitious goal for the country
 unhone bharat main nivesh kii sambhaavnaaon kaa zikr karte hue bhartiya arthvyavastha kaa bhi bakhaan kiya
 He said that India is moving towards becoming a five trillion dollar economy by 2025
 is tarah piem modi ne bharatiyon or bhartiya kaarobaar jagat ke saamne ek tarah kaa lakshya rakh diya he ki 2025 tak bhartiya arthvyavastha ko 5 lakh karod dollar tak pahunchaana he
 This is a very ambitious goal, as doubling the economy in the next eight years is no less a challenge
 naukari dene vaala desh banegaa bharatpiem ne kaha ki yadi ham aisa kar paae to naukari khojane waalon ko bhul jaaie, bharat naukari dene vaala banegaa
 This goal of PM Modi is another challenge for the country, because right now the country is struggling to create sufficient number of jobs

 bharat ko nivesh kaa aakarshak sthal bataate hue piem modi ne kaha ki jo log dhan ke saath tandoorusti or samruddhi ke saath shanti chaahate hai unhen bharat aana chahie
 Modi is the first Indian Prime Minister in two decades to attend the World Economic Forum conference in Davos
 is baar ye sammelan is myne main khaas rahaa kyonki udghaatan bhaashan piem modi ne diya
 In his speech, where he talked about economy and investment, he also told the three biggest challenges facing the world
 sudhaar, pradarshan or badlaavpiem modi ne ye bhi kaha ki maujuuda vakt main bharat kaa sakal gharelu utpaada lagbhag 2
 2 trillion dollars
 or 2025 tak deshpanch lakh karod dollar kii arthvyavasthabanane kii disha main aage bad rahaa he
 He stressed that the government is following the principle of reform, performance and change
 piem modi ne aaj kaha, 'hamane bharat main nivesh, utpaadan or kaam karne ko aasaan banaaya he
 We have decided to root out the license and permit raj

 ' congress ne aaropon se ghire bhaajapa pramukh nitin gadakari kaa bachaav karne ke liye party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani par kataaksh kiya or kaha ki yah bhrashtachar sahit ‘harek mudde’ par bhaajapa ke ‘dohare maapdand’ ko darshata he
 Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said that the BJP has realized the double standards in its attitude on every issue
 jab bhi bhaajapa yaa iske netaa sawaalon ke daayre main aate hai to suvidhajanak dhang se raajnneetik vidwaish kaa tark de diya jaataa he lekin jab yah gaiyr bhaajapa vyakti se judaa maamla hota he to ve bina jimmevary or sanyam ke aawaaj uthaane lagate hai
 Tiwari was reacting to BJP leader Advani's statement in which Advani praised Gadkari's offer to face investigation into the allegations and said it was a reasonable answer
 adwani ne yah bhi kaha ki gadakari par jo aarope hai ve kaarobaar ke mandandon ko lekar hai naa ki satta ke durupyog yaa bhrashtachar ke
 He cautioned the Congress-led UPA government not to use 'political enmity' in the investigation against the BJP president to hide his stains
 congress ke ek anya pravaktaa raashid alvi ne bhi adwani ke bayaan kii hansi udaate hue kaha ki agar aaropon kaa jawaab dene ke bajaay vah gadakari ko badhai de rahe hai to desh kii janata iskaa karaara jawaab degi
 He also tried to establish a similarity between the controversy related to Gadkari and the controversy with former BJP president Bangaru Laxman
 rashtriya rajmargon or state haive se 500 meter tak sharaab kii dukaanon par roak ke maamle main supreme court ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki haive par hotalon or privet club main sharaab parosi ja sakegi yaa nahin isaki sunwaayee july main karenge
 Hotels and private clubs from several states including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka have filed petitions in the Supreme Court
 privet klbon kii ore se court main kaha gaya he ki wo sirf apane sadasyon ko hi sharaab paroste hai or wo sharaab lekar baahar nahin ja sakate
 
 isliye privet klbon ko is aadesh se chhot milani chahie
 At the same time, it has also been asked on behalf of the hoteliers that the Supreme Court amend their orders, because these orders are causing loss of crores of rupees and loss of employment of thousands of people
 tamilnadu or puduccheri samet kai rajyon ke hotalon or klbon ne bhi is aadesh main sanshodhan kii maang kii he
 The comments rashtriya rajmargon or state haive se 500 meter tak sharaab kii dukaanon par roak ke maamle main beete 31 march ko supreme court ne faisla sunaate hue kaha tha ki haive par sharaab kii dukaanon par roak jari rahegi
 However, there will be no shops up to 220 meters in areas with less than 20 thousand population in any town along the highway

 States where liquor licenses were granted before December 15
 
 There the licenses will run till 30 September
 darasal, pichley saal 15 disambar ko supreme court ne bada faisla diya tha ki rashtriya rajmargon or state haive se 500 meter tak sharaab kii dukaane nahin hongi
 However, it was also clarified that such shops can run till the end of the period for those who have licenses or till 31 March 2017, whichever is earlier
 vahiin, hotel waalon kii taraf se bhi kaha gaya he ki supreme court apane adeshon main sanshodhan kare, kyonki in adeshon se unka karodon rupee kaa nuksaan ho rahaa he or hajaaron logon kaa rojgaar bhi chhin gaya he
 Hotels and clubs in several states, including Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, have also demanded amendments to the order
 tippaniyan In the case of ban on liquor shops up to 500 meters from National Highways and State Highways, on 31 March, the Supreme Court ruled that liquor shops on the highway will continue to be banned
 haalanki hive ke kinare kisi kasbe main 20 hajaar se kam jansankhya vaale ilaakon main 220 meter tak dukaane nahin hongi
