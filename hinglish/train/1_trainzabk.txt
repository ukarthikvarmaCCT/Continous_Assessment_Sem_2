 ek kendriya mantri kii likhi kitaab main daawa kiya gaya he ki sonia gandhi or tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pivi narsingh raav ke rishte tanaavpurn the, kyonki sonia, rajeev gandhi hatyakand maamle kii jaanch main dhimi pragati se naakhush thim
 In the book 'sonia - the Beloved of the Message' by Union Food and Civil Supplies Minister KV Thomas, it was stated that in August 1995, when Sonia publicly expressed her displeasure, it was in two years after her return to active politics His entry was the backdrop
 purv kendriya mantri natwar singh bhi is baat kii pushti kar chuke hai ki sonia or raav ke rishte saamaanya nahin the
 He had told that one night in May 1995, Rao called him and told him how he (sonia) had insulted him (rao)
 thomas ne apni kitaab main 20 agast, 1995 ko rajeev gandhi ke janmdin par sonia dwaara die gaye bhaashan kaa sandarbh dete hue kaha he ki unke (sonia ke) shabdon se puure desh ko pidaa hui thi
 Thomas wrote in the book, that's why Sonia raised her finger on the government
 vah raav kii kareebi nahin thim
 Suffering from the excessive delay in the investigation of Rajiv's murder, Sonia questioned what would happen to the common man who fights for justice if the investigation into the murder of the former Prime Minister is taking so long
 thomas ne apni kitaab main kaha he ki ise sarlikrut rup se yah nahin samajha janaa chahie ki yah nyaay dilaane kii prakriya kii sust raftaar ke virodh main koi bayaan tha
 When the Congress was in power, this bitter criticism of Narasimha Rao from Sonia was actually his condemnation
 kitaab ke anusaar, sonia ko lagata tha ki jab tak raav satta main rahenge, rajeev kii hatya kii jaanch aage nahin badhegi
 He said, he (sonia) strongly believed that perhaps some other agency had conspired to assassinate Rajiv and carried out it through LTTE
 yahi ve halaat the, jisane sonia ko raajnneeti main laayaa
 How could she remain silent when the party building was collapsing

 Natwar Singh, referring to the noting of his diary in the newspaper, wrote, around 9 pm, PV entered, but he did not sit
 aam taur par avichlit rahane vaale pivi pareshaan or vichlit najar aa rahe the
 He said, i just received his (sonia's) letter
 maine kaha, maine use nahin dekha he
 
 
 It seemed as if a war was going on between the two through letters to hear the case of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination
 purv videshmantri ke mutabik, raav ne jo kuch kaha, vah itnaa apratyaashit tha ki unke munh se shabd nahin nikal rahe the
 The then Prime Minister had said, i can deal with them, i do not want to do this, what does she expect from me? In those days, Natwar Singh was a junior minister in Rao's cabinet
 baad main unke bich matbhed ho gaye the
 Singh suggested Rao meet Sonia Gandhi
 tab raav ne kaha, main kitni baar unase miluun? yah mere atmasamman kaa sawaal he
 Their behavior is affecting my health
 kitni baar meraa apmaan kiya jayega? singh ne tab raav se kaha ki unhone sonia se kabhi raav ke bare main baat nahin kii, lekin unhen (sonia ko) aisa lagata he ki unke pati kii hatya ke maamle kii jaanch apekshit gati se aage nahin bad rahi he
 Singh wrote in the newspaper that Rao told him about all the steps of the government
 usamen pi chidambaram ko maamle kii jaanch kaa prabharee banane kii bhi baat shaamil thi

 garbhanal mahila ke hi sharir kaa hi abhinn ang hota he, jo garbhavastha ke dauraan bachche ko suraksha or poshan dene kaa kaam karata he

 The umbilical cord helps in the formation of lactogen in the body, which stimulates the process of milk production in the mother's body
 3
 The umbilical cord connects the mother and child
 maa jo kuch bhi khaati he, aahaar naal ke madhyam se uskaa poshan bachche ko bhi miltaa he

 Now the placenta of the child is being saved because it helps in understanding the genetic diseases or any medical case history of the child and provides better treatment in a better way

 This led to differences so much that the two-year old friendship of the two parties was broken

 aise main aap andaja laga sakate hai ki dilli main bachche kitni khatarnaak hawa main saans le rahe hai

 internet par kamottejak photo or video dekhne ke kai said effect hai
 Some people believe that there is no harm in watching porn
 iske ulat kai tathy aise hai, jo is tarah ke kaam ko nuksaandeh sabit karte hai
 The matter is serious
 yahi vajah he ki desh kii sabase badi adaalat ko bhi sarkaar se yah kahana padataa he ki vah internet par maujuud porn par rokthaam ke liye upaay sujhaaye or iske liye kadam uthaae
 Despite this, the alam is that every time the government expresses its helplessness, it completes its work
 khayr, mudda yah he ki kya porn dekhne ke kuch phaayde hai? kya ise dekhne se hone vaala nuksaan 'kshanik santushti' par baari padataa he? kya porn vaivaahik jivan main jehar ghol saktaa he? yahaan inhen baton par vistaar se charchaa kii gai he
 How much is responsible for crime like rape? Pornographic materials are also responsible for the rampant increase in incidents of rape in the society
 ek had tak yah baat vaazib bhi lagati he
 The other side of this is that the person watching porn satisfies himself 'in the same way' and thus survives a major social crime
 vaivaahik jivan par porn kaa asarsatahi taur par dekhne main aisa lagata he ki porn shaadishuda jindagi main 'josh' laane main madadgaar sabit ho saktaa he
 But its addiction can destroy marital life
 aisa maanane se peeche kai kaaran hai:partner se 'zyada' kii ummid karnaa nuksaandehporn dekhne vaale jode apane partner se waisi hi ummid karte hai, jaisaa ve ashleel video main dekhte hai
 The reality is that those films are deliberately made more provocative, which is not possible to put into reality every time
 isse donon main asantosh to panapata he, swabhaav main krurta or ugrata bhi aa sakati he, jo aage chalakar nuksaandeh sabit hota he
 It may be in love to give a partner the person who watches pornographic videos repeatedly when he is addicted, he starts to weave the dream and wants to satisfy himself in the same way every time
 yahaan tak ki kai baar partner se sachmuch sambhog karne kii uski ichha khatm ho jaati he
 It may also happen that in the circle of sex, his love for the partner will be reduced
 aise main rishte main daraar aana tay he
 The risk of losing the 'natural quality' of the body increases the risk of losing the 'natural vigor' of the body if it is resorted to external means such as porn to produce repeated sensations
 tab aisi bhi sthiti paidaa ho sakati he ki bina porn dekhe uttejnaa hi na paidaa ho
 This is a big danger
 anjaane main vivahetar sambandh ko badhavshleel filmon kii vajah se naitikta ko taak par rakhane kii pravriti bad sakati he
 This can lead people to extramarital affairs
 matlab maryaada taar-taar hone kii ashanka bahut zyada bad jaati he

 The gated residential enclave has become one of the most preferred forms of real estate development in urban India
 iske alaava, vishaal gramin kshetra hai, jo darwajaband anclevon main tabdeel hokar raturaat shahari ho gaye hai
 In many large and small cities across the country, gated communities are being built (or they already exist) and have been used on a baffling scale
 lihaaja, sahaara korporation 'desh ke 217 shaharon main suniyojit aatmanirbhar ucch gunvattta vaali townships kii vishwa kii sabase lambii shrinkhalaa' banane kii yojana he (ahmedabada 104 acre; coimbatore, keralah 103 acre; lakhanu: 200 acre)
 Sahara Corporation has already built 10,000 acres of Ambi Valley Township near Pune, which was called 'india's first planned, self-reliant, enchanting, independent city known for its unprecedented grandeur and spectacular special features'
 is
 rajasthan ke bhiwadi township main kam-se-kam 11 real estate companiyon dwaara alag-alag keemton vaali darwajaband rihaayshi pariyojnaayen shuru kiye jane kii khabar he, jo reliance or omax jaisi badi companiyon dwaara kai niryaat prasanskaran kshetron or vishesh aarthik kshetron ke vikaas kii prastaavna se munafa kamaane kii ummid kar rahi hai
 The most notable aspect of the marketing of these gated enclaves is the promotion of their self-sufficient nature
 sambhavit nivaasiyon ko bataaya jaataa he ki ve yahaan har tarah ke aparaadh se surakshit rahenge, 'baahar' kii duniya kii asuvidhaon se mukt hokar jivan kaa anand le sakenge, ek asli shantipurna maahaul kaa anubhav kar sakenge or unka vaasta sirf 'apane jaise' logon se padegaa baar-baar ise hamaare apane rihaayshi digniland kaa sapana kaha jaataa he
 The promise of transporting you to a global natural scene in hand, further reinforces the paradigmatic nature of marketing of these enclosed enclaves
 'samekit townships' kaa nirmaan, jisamen kisi ko kaam par jane ke liye bhi get se baahar na janaa pade, aatm-kendrit vishwa kii bhaavana ko or tej kar saktaa he
 So are we in a position to create the society that believes that social problems can be directly out of sight and those who can afford it are fortified enclaves beyond these problems It should be a matter of debate whether the gated communities are the real solution to the needs and problems of our complex society? Yet, what these gated communities underscore is the distrust of security, and the ability of the polity to provide day-to-day infrastructure, a strong sense that the middle class is threatened by the urban 'lower classes' and There is widespread recognition that such threats can only be countered by building very safe areas
 darwajaband anchlev hamen pashchim ke prati drushtikon ke bare main bhi kuch rochak baaten bataate hai
 This is why the naming of the very earliest enclaves (ridgewood, Windsor, Princeton) almost invariably attempted to look at the image of the English upper-class life
 baad main hue nirmaanon ko aise naam die gaye, jo sthaan ko lekar ek zyada vaishvik ehsaas dilaa saken
 For example- The Icon, World Spa, New Town Heights
 rochak baat yah he ki yah pratyaksh vaishviktaa dharmik anushthanon ke saath-saath chal rahi he
 For example customs like Karva Chauth have found a new life within the walls of this new India
 shaayad yah bollywood kaa asar he
 The new Indian woman also worships her husband's health and also exercises in private gymnasiums
 haalanki, bollywood kii puraani filmon vaale bharat ke vipareet, darwajaband samudaay dharmik vividhta rakhane kii koshish nahin karte hai
 It is not new for our era to install doors to physically identify residential areas
 dilli kii tamaam rihaayshi bastiyon main ahm pravesh binduon par daravaaje lagavane or unka rakrakhaav karne main resident welphar associations (aradblue) vishesh taur par sakriy rahete hai
 In Delhi's residential areas, 'door-to-door' work began around the mid-1980s and under the flag of Resident Welfare Associations in various areas of the city
 sampann logon ne 'suraksha' kaa hawala dete hue aane-jane ke saarvajanik raaston par avrodh khadey kar die or nijee kism ke sthanon kaa nirmaan kar diya
 These actions were not properly lawful, but neither the government questioned them nor the social organizations
 gudgaanv or bangalore ke darwajaband samudaayon ne pruthakkaran ke aise vichaaron kaa or vistaar kiya or unhen or pusht kiya
 The gated enclave seems to be more a symbol of the problems we are facing as a society than a clear solution
 galiyon or bazaaron ke 'khataron' kii tulana main, visheshkar mahilaon ke liye, unamem ek mukt sthaan uplabdh hota he, lihaaja unhen praayah zyada pasand kiya jaataa he
 Despite this, it should be clearly seen that what we have to deal with is dangerous in our public spaces or say that there is a masculine culture
 hamen yah nahin maan baithna chahie ki samaadhaan meljol ke kritrim sthanon ke nirmaan main he
 The unfortunate fact is that for the largest section of the population (or for women who leave for work), the gated community offers no option to avoid public violence
 phir us prachurtaa ke vaade kaa kya kahenge, jo deevaaron main simit samudaay kaa ek mukhya aakarshan he? nishchit taur par ek sukhad astitv ke liye dainandin kii suvidhaon ko jutaney main galat kuch nahin he
 But, as recent media reports indicate, the uninterrupted supply of water and electricity in shared property settlements in Gurgaon is ensured by the enormous private and social costs, and out of this we are particularly concerned about social costs Should be worried nijee taur par utpaadit bijli or bhumigat jal ke baari-bharkam shoshan kii paryaavarniya laagat ko bijli ke bilon or pani ke shulk ke aankadon se puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Long-term social costs of private convenience have to be considered
 har haalat main, gudgaanv main rahane vaala koi bhi yah to jaanata hi he ki kabhi khatm na hone vaale pani kii aapurti ke vaade antat fatehpur sikri kaa rasta pakad lenge
 The kind of thinking that can arise from such communities regarding the nature of community life and social interaction is probably the most important aspect of these gated communities
 daravaaje duniya ko baahar chhod dene or swayan ko un logon kii samasyaon se khud ko alag rakhane ke pratik hai, jo daravaajon ke bheetar aane main samarth nahin hote hai
 Given that Indian society has expertise in creating the most elaborate new symbols of social strata and uniqueness, the gated enclaves are probably a purely Indian phenomenon despite being practiced worldwide

 The author is a professor of sociology at The Institute of Economic Growth congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi raibareli se saansad hai
 The Congress holds three important posts from Rae Bareli district
 ek emelsi, ek jila panchayat or ek vidhayak hai
 Interestingly, the three brothers hold these three positions and have a dispute with the Congress
 ek bhai dinesh pratap singh, jo emelsi hai, unako congress zila adhyaksh ve ke shukla ne anishchit kaal ke liye party se nilambit kar diya he
 In such a situation, there is a danger that somewhere, the other two brothers of Dinesh also should not give a shock to the Congress
 aapako bataa den ki lambey samay sesonia gandhike sansadeey kshetra ke prabharee ke el sharma se dinesh singh kaa vivaad chal rahaa tha
 After the change of government in UP recently, when the no-confidence motion came against the District Panchayat President of Rae Bareli and Awadhesh Singh, brother of Dinesh, his chair barely survived
 jiske baad se hi dinesh lagaataar ke el sharma par nuksaan pahunchane kaa aarope lagaate rahen hai
 He even said that either he will remain in the Congress or KL Sharma
 gauratlab he ki jiske baad hi party ke jila adhyaksh ne alaakaman ke nirdesh kaa hawala dete hue dinesh singh ko party se anischitkaal ke liye nilambit kar diya
 After all, Congress also realizes that, if now Dinesh Singh leaves the party or joins another party, then his membership of the Legislative Council will be lost
 isiilie unako nikaala nahin gaya he
 Also recently, one of the 7 Congress mlas in the state, his brother Rakesh Singh and District Panchayat President Bhai Awadhesh have not yet taken action under this strategy
 lekin raibareli kaa ye tazaa ghatnakram congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke liye ek jhatka to jarur he
 Well, who can forget that in the last few years, Ra Sharma has strategically been KL Sharma and politically the Dinesh Singh Gandhi family has two important pillars
 haalanki ,ke el sharma kaa gandhi parivaar se naata dashakon purana he, shaayad isiilie bhi ke el sharma ko tavajjo di gai he
 By the way, sources also believe that, after the bad Congress in UP, Dinesh Singh was looking for a new way with his family, but he wanted the Congress to expel him from the party, including his family, so that his legislature would remain intact
 kul milakar desh bhar se aaye din congress chhodkar jane vaale netaaon kii khabaren aa raheen hai, lekin khud congress adhyaksh ke ilaake main hua ye tazaa vivaad vaaki congress ko jhakzorne vaala he
 If sources are to be believed, now Priyanka has taken the front, so that if Dinesh Singh keeps distance with his family, then the party will not suffer in the future
 iske liye raibareli shahar se 5 baar vidhayak rahe dabang akhilesh singh beti aditi singh ko badhaava diya ja saktaa he
 For the first time, Aditi became an MLA from Rae Bareli in place of her father
 vittamantri arun jetali ne kaha he ki vah vetanbhogi tathaa madhyamvarg par tex kaa or boj daalane ke paksh main nahin hai or unhone tex kii chori karne waalon ko tex ke daayre main laane kii baat kahi
 Jaitley said that in reality he would like taxpayers to have more money in their pockets so that they can spend more, which would increase indirect tax collection
 jetali ne kaha, kar aadhaar badhaane kaa aakhir kya matlab he?
 
 
 i also do as much indirectly as my assistant gives
 hamaari khapat kii maatra alag-alag ho sakati he, isiilie har koi apratyaksh kar de rahaa he
 '' jetali ne kaha, vastav main aaj aapke kareeb aadhe kar apratyaksh kar hai, aap utpaada shulk dete hai, seemaa shulk dete hai, seva kar dete hai
 Now as far as income tax is concerned, to increase the tax coverage in this, i support bringing tax evaders under its purview
 unase yah poocha gaya tha ki kya vah apane bajet main rajasav badhaane ke liye kar aadhaar (nunatam tex limit) badhayenge
 Jaitley, who is going to present his first full budget in February, said that he increased the income tax exemption limit from Rs 2 lakh to 2 in the last budget
 5 lakh rupee kar di or agar unke paas dhan kii kami nahin hoti, to vah is seemaa ko or badhaate
 Arun Jaitley said, '2
 5 lakh rupee kii iskar chhot seemaa ke bare main jab ham baat karte hai
 
 sabhi katautiyon ko shaamil karte huye, jo hamane di hai, aaj 3
 a person earning 5 to 4 lakhs per annum does not have to pay tax
 is lihaaj se mute taur par ham us sthiti main pahunch gaye hai
 ' jetali ne kaha, 'agar aaj koi 35,000 se 40,000 rupee kamata he or vah kuch bachat karata he to use kar nahin dena padataa he
 But those who earn in this category, they say that they are unable to save anything after living expenses, transportation costs, children's school fees
 ' The minister said that is why he is not in favor of reducing various exemptions to increase the tax net
 unhone kaha, 'isiilie meri yah ichha he ki agar mere hisaab se chijen hui or meri jeb main or paise hue to main ise badhanaa chaahunga
 But today the revenue situation is challenging
 pichhali baar, maine kai chhot di jo vastav main meri kshamta se baahar thi
 ' jetali ne kaha, 'lekin jo kar chori kar rahe hai, unhen iske daayre main laana sahi hoga
 But bringing the weaker sections under the tax net cannot be today's policy
 vastav main agar aap unki jeb main atirikt paisa daalate hai or unhen kharch karne kii chhot dete hai to mujhe zyada apratyaksh kar milegaa or main zyada aarthik gatividhiyon ko protsaahit kar sakuunga
 ' desh main kaale dhan ke bare main unhone kaha, 'yah badi maatra main he or iskaa aasaani se pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Because if you go to real estate, see the purchase and purchase of land, go to the mining sector, look at jewelery, see luxury goods, you will find domestic black money in it
 aap shikshan sansthaanon main jaaiye, aapako yah vahaan milegaa
 Therefore, it is very easy to find the buyer and the recipient
 ' The Congress has become very aggressive about Goa and Manipur

 Rahul Gandhi said in Chandigarh that money was used in Manipur and Goa

 Rahul Gandhi went to the swearing-in ceremony of Captain Amarinder Singh, CM of Punjab

 Khalid's dream of winning the 'sea lottery' in childhood finally came true on the morning of 30 October, after he had spent nearly 20 years as a fisherman, when he and his two friends found ambergris floating in the sea, It was a very bad smell

 US President Donald Trump said in an interview Sunday, calling Defense Minister James Mattis "like a Democrat" that he could step down

 As Venu Madhav Govind entered public life, Gandhi used to create a strong reaction among the people
 yah shanti ke doot ke liye asaamaanya lag saktaa he
 But intense feelings towards the Mahatma begin to make sense when we come to know that he was absolutely original, in its very basic sense
 gandhi ko vidaa hue saat dashak ho gaye hai, lekin hamaare mushkil vakt main ab bhi unki baaten samaadhaan kii tarah hai, kyonki unke vichaar ugantarkari hai
 By revisiting what he has achieved during his lifetime, we can understand the relevance of Gandhi
 aisa najariya aaj ke yug main bhi unke mahatv ko spasht kar degaa
 Gandhi returned to India in 1915, serene but equipped with steely resolve and great ambition
 unke liye us daur kii sabase badi takat-british samrajyavad ke changul se hi bharat ko nikaalnaa hi paryaapt nahin tha
 Gandhi sought to achieve this by changing the modalities and social structure of the politics of that era
 to, kya gandhi un sabamein safal hue, jo lakshya unhone nirdhaarit kiye the, lekin hakeekat yah he ki yah sab unki mahatvakankshaon ek chota hissaa bhar tha
 It is well known that Gandhi established non-violence as a new ethos through many campaigns and speeches, writings and his ashramwasi life
 bharat main satyagrah kii safalataa ne duniya bhar main use asahmati vyakt karne or vivaad-samaadhaan ke naitik or vyaavhaarik aujaar ke rup main sthapit kiya
 But we do not cover Gandhi's revolutionary ideas because of his prior knowledge
 raajnneeti ke liye gandhi kaa drushtikon naitik, loktantric or asaamaanya tha
 The rejection of violence that enabled the common people to participate in the public domain is not possible by armed means
 jawaharlal nehru apni kitaab discovery of india main gandhi kii vajah se bharat main aae badlaav kii charchaa karte hai
 At a time when British rule was creating a "stranglehold of panic, repression, fear"
 
 
 gandhi kii dheer-gambhir aawaaj uthi: daro mat
 Gandhi encouraged people to act at their discretion without fear, but this activism came with important responsibilities
 gandhi kii drushti main saadhan bhi utana hi jaruri tha, jitna saadhy, bhale hi saadhy kitna hi mahaan yaa jaij kyon na lagata ho
 Therefore, without this, one had to be prepared for a compromise agreement with his original principles
 isamen vyaktigat shuchita or eemaandaar aatm-avlokan kii bhi jarurat he, jisase jivan khuli kitaab ban jaataa he
 In fact, we know of Gandhi's many failures because he has told us honestly about him without any hesitation
 ahimsa ko sthapit karke vishaal janandolan khadaa karne ke alaava, gandhi behad baarik samaj vaale sanstha-nirmaataa bhi the
 The Indian National Congress, the newborn child of the Indian oligarchy, was transformed into a vast political force by Gandhi into a vast mass organization
 unhone 1920 ke dashak main chaar aana sadsyta kii jo shuruyaat kii thi, teen dashak baad bharat ke samvidhan main saarvbhaumik vayask matadhikaar ko apnaane ke peeche usee drushtikon kii chhap dekh sakate hai
 We can also note here that while he advocated Hindustani — written in Nagari and Urdu — as a common language, the language also acknowledged the importance of one's culture and identity
 unhone un aupniveshik prantiy simaaon ko asweekaar kiya jo prashasnic suvidha ke hisaab se taiyaar kii gai thi or jo bharat par unke vijay ke itihaas ko darshaati thi
 Gandhi reorganized the Congress on a linguistic basis
 swatantraaa ke baad se, is siddhant ne ek jatil raashtra main ekta kii shakti ke rup main kaary kiya he
 Representative institutions have an important role in democracy, but Gandhi was deeply skeptical of the ability of these institutions to establish a system of justice and equality
 aaj, loktantr kii in pratinidhi sansthaaon ke vajood par khatarnaak vishwavyaapee sankat tari he
 Even though the election process works smoothly, public interest is barely visible in law and governance
 saadhaaran log teji se rajnatik prakriya se niraash hone lage hai jo taqatvar bade kaarobaariyon or korporate samoohon kii ichhaapoorti karne main juta hota he
 In many countries, the state seems to be trying to increase its hold, so the stance of the states on many legitimate demands raised by the minorities or the poor is seen
 duniya bhar main in dinon vikrut raajnneeti ke saath media or patrakarita kii gahari santhganth ek nayaa sankat paidaa kar rahi he, jisaki aajkal bharat main sabase buree tasviir dikh rahi he
 In his long and extremely busy public life, Gandhi was also in the role of a journalist and editor, albeit in a different way
 unhone kai patr-patrikaon ko chalaaya—bina vigyapanon ke—or unhen apane vichaaron ko bade paimaane par janata tak pahunchane kaa madhyam banaaya
 He always considered journalism to be a responsible act, yet he himself was a frequent victim of fake news
 1946 main, ek najuk rajnatik vaarta ke dauraan press main ai ek shararthpurna khabar ke jawaab main, gandhi ji ne uttejk tippanee kii—''akhbaar vaale chalate-phirte plig ban gaye hai
 "on another occasion, he remarked that" if i were appointed dictator for a day in place of Viceroy, i would close all newspapers
 '' haalanki unhone muskaraate hue kaha ki ve apni patrika harijan ko apwaad rup main band nahin karenge
 Gandhi launched large political campaigns but his focus was always the change in the conduct of individuals
 apane sahyogiyon ke vipareet, ve sarkaar ko taqatvar banane ke khilaaf the
 According to him, non-equality can severely affect the welfare and independence of a person
 gandhi kii najar main logon ko unke adhikaron kii raksha karne ke liye zyada adhikaar die jane chahie
 His argument was, "swaraj in the true sense will establish true swaraj not by establishing control over all the powers, but by standing against the power of all in the event of violation of their rights
" ''aarthik drushti se, vyakti ke prati gandhi kii patibaddhta ne unhen khaadi or gramodyog jaise rachanaatmak kaaryon kii vakaalat karne ke liye prerit kiya, jo bina kisi sampatti, kaushal yaa shiksha ke lakhon vyaktiyon ko faldaayi rojgaar pradaan karne kaa saadhan tha
 For him, the question of economic justice was related to the destiny of agrarian India, because in his time, most Indians lived in villages and earned their livelihood in the village itself
 unka kahana tha ''buddhi kaushal or shram ko alag karne se gaanvon kii andekhi kaa aparaadh hua he
 And so, instead of beauty in the villages of the country, we just see droppings of cow dung
 '' kaaphi had tak, yah sab aaj bhi sach he
 Another fundamental aspect of Gandhi's life was his commitment to secularism
 haalanki ve sanatani hindu the, lekin unka maananaa tha ki sabhi ko bina kisi dar ke apane dharm kaa paalan karne main sakasham hona chahie
 Gandhi's argument was also in its favor that if India fails to do justice to the minorities, then this will confirm Jinnah's theory that both Hindu and Muslim communities cannot live together
 apane antim varshon main sampradayikta ke khilaaf gandhi ke sahaspurn sangharsh baad ke varshon main bharat ke liye shanti or sthirataa kaa ek mahatvapurn maarg hasil karne ke liye ahm the
 Advocate of non-violence, Gandhi recognized a violent tendency among people of every caste, class and religion
 isliye unhone ek nae, samaveshi rashtrawaad ko janm diya
 On questions of language, culture, religion, education and economic justice, he showed India a non-ambivalent path of modernity that did not mimic Europe, but took into account India's diversity and needs
 beshak, gandhi vibhaajan ko rokane yaa jatigat aadhaar par bante bharat ko puri tarah se apane purvagrahon se bachaane main vifal rahe
 But if they had not been there, India's departure towards democracy could have been worse
 bharat ne swatantraaa ke baad bahut kuch hasil kiya he
 Nevertheless, readers will feel that everything said above points to the same fundamental challenges that we are facing
 khaskar, aaj kii satta un mulyon ko vyapak rup se nazarandaaj karti he jisaki neenv gandhi ne rakhi or use aage badhaayaa
 We keep swinging from our standing crisis to another crisis - like demonetisation, NRC in Assam, Kashmir, mob violence against Muslims - the country is distracted by the atmosphere of frustration and fear
 bhartiya ganraajya astitvgat sankat ke kagaar par khadaa he
 In these unusually bad times, through his messages of love and justice, Gandhi shows the difficult but right direction ahead
 gandhi ke hatyare ne sochaa tha ki vah mahatma ko teen goliyon se chup kara saktaa he, jisaki maujuuda sattadhariyon main kai gungan karte hai
 He succeeded in erasing Gandhi's body
 lekin bharat or duniyabar main aise bahut se log hai jo gandhi ke mulyon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 These ideas and values did not belong to Gandhi alone, but to all those who wanted a more just and humane world
 maayusi or nairashya ke is daur main, hamen khud ko gandhi kii us udghoshnaa ko yaad karnaa chahie: ''mrityu ke madhya, jivan kaayam rahata he; asaty ke bich satya kaa astitv bana rahata he; andhere ke bich, prakaash bana rahata he

 saal 2014 ke chunavi mahasamar main agar kisi ek naam kii sabase adhik charchaa he, to vah naam bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi kaa he
 There is talk of 'modi wave' everywhere from the meeting room of the party to the streets of Kashi
 darasal modi kii chunavi raah or sadak se satta tak kaa safar utana aasaan bhi nahin he, kyonki sampradayikta se lekar snupaget or tamaam aise mudde hai, jisapar modi ko gheraa gaya he or nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Look at Narendra Modi's style in pictures
 
 
 saat charan matdaan ho chuke hai
 But will Modi overcome these complications? What does he think on the allegations? Why does he become soft in the name of Priyanka Vadra amidst opposition? If a BJP government is formed, what will Modi do in the first 100 days, what will be his policies and how will his cabinet
 yah or aise hi kai sawaalon par narendra modi ne aaj tak ko die apane exclusive intervyuu main bebaak raay rakhi
 In this 'most solid interview' of Modi during the election season, what Modi said, read every word, in his own words
 
 
 modi:ek saal to kya, sirf 4-5 maheene kaa khel he
 See brother, i am a laborer, i have worked as a child since childhood
 jo bhi kaam miltaa he, majdoor kii tarah karata hum
 i do it with my heart and my mind and the party has given work, so i do not believe that there should be no loosening in it
 kotahi nahin baratani chahie or paramatma ne mujhe jitna samay diya he, jitani shakti di he, kshamta di he, uskaa bharpoor upyog us jimmedaari ko puraa karne ke liye karnaa chahie
 God bless, no disturbance came

 In the different things that the Western media wrote about my election camp, one thing was also written that public meetings of political parties in Hindustan are 2-2, 4-4 hours late
 lekin tulana kii jaae, to modi kii utani let nahin chalati he
 He has written so
 shakti to shaayad logon ke aashirwad se aati hogi, desh kii pidaa ke kaaran bhi daudane kaa man karata hoga
 Maybe there is a thing called commitment in life, which makes a man run
 yoga-pranayam par bole modi
 
 
 That is my routine life
 wo aaj se nahin he
 As a child, we used to go to RSS
 vahiin se training hui
 Later life was also my attempt to move in that direction, so that is part of my life
 lekin in dinon kaaphi disterbd he
 These days i am not able to give this much time for yoga
 lekin vaise main kah saktaa hum ki 365 din yoga karata hum
 On cases, Modi i do not believe that that stage has come
 abhi to unhone soochna di he
 The law will do its job
 hamaari jo legal team hogi, wo uskaa kaam karegi, lekin mujhe is baat kaa hameshaa garv rahaa he ki itane lambey samaye se saarvajanik jivan main hum
 Never in my life has there ever been a case of scooter parking, nor has there ever been a case of driving a car on the side

 The Gujarat Police has just given the inquiry
 wo kaise karenge, inquairi karne ke baad jo report denge, wo ellection kamishan ko denge
 It does not cause the media to give it and i do not even know it
 police stesan ke andar bayanmen in chizon main bahut aalochana or samay barbaad nahin karata hum
 That is not why i have been facing similar wrong things for the last 12-14 years
 wo do, chaar, das or bhi ho jaaenge hoti rahati hai, kya karenge
 How far from the 7 race course after 7 phases? i study this election very closely
 campagne to karata hum, lekin main ek political science kaa student rahaa hum
 After the election was announced, senior Congress leaders started leaving the field
 janata to baad main maidan main ai
 He felt that Bhago, for the first time in India, the Pre Poll Alliance has been with 25 parties
 wo pehali baar bijepi ke saath hua he, to ye ek taraf positive pravaah
 On the other hand, non-congress contenders, negative flow
 usee se bigining main, bahut bigining main sanket mil gaya tha ki chunaav ladane kaa congress kaa hausala hi nahin he
 There was no question of winning, there was no mood to fight, it seemed
 khayr baad main unke liye ab sarkaar bachaane kaa wo agenda nahin he, kam se kam 100 ke aankade tak paar karen, us disha main wo apni mehnat kar rahe hai
 But the Congress party does not seem to be able to cross double digit
 aise koi asaar najar nahin aa rahe hai
 The electoral strategy of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Good Governance, Development, Suraj, Development - these issues are embracing the people
 logon ko lagata he ki bahut ho chukaa, ab koi karne vaali baat to bataaen ki main ye karnaa chahta hum
 i want to do this and the public has got confidence in that and that is why i think that in the last 20-25 years, perhaps the best, stable, strong government will give the people of the country to the country
 khud ke bhavi piem hone ke bare mendekhie, bhartiya janata party ne narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya he or desh kii janata ne mohar lagaana shuru kar diya he, lekin jis shabdon main aap chaahate hai un shabdon main main jawaab nahin de saktaa hum, kyonki mujhe bhi 16 may tak kaa intjaar karnaa chahie or 16 may ko duusari baar mauka duungaa aapako
 What is Modi's road map 
 
 bhartiya janata party ke paas bahut clear cat road map he
 Along with that we also have our track record
 dekhie, hindustan main or main chaahunga kabhi in vishyon par desh main dibet ho, bharat ne congress seoup gavarnence dekha he, bharat ne riginal political party seoup garvanence or political activity dekha he
 The country has also seen family parties
 leftist kaa bhi dekha he or bijepi kaa bhi dekha he
 Today, a model of some one or the other state is working in India
 kahin community kaa kar rahaa he, kahin pradeshik pakshon kaa kar rahaa he, kahin congress kaa kar rahaa he, kahin leftist kaa kar rahaa he, kahin bijepi kaa kar rahaa he
 In 5 years, you have extracted 12,15,20,25 parameters, what does this government do in this parameter, then the country will come to notice that wherever the BJP Rould state is there, there is a lot of focus activity development
 ab dekhie, digvijay singh ji ko itnaa lambaa samay madhya pradesh main raaj karne kaa avasar mila, lekin wo biimaar rajya rahaa
 Shivraj Singh 'chauhan' drove out the sick state in such a short time and it takes a lot of hard work
 chhattisgarh nayaa rajya bana, ek prakaar se maowad se prabhavit, tribal belt lekin aaj chote rajyon main da best financial disipleen, ye chhattisgarh main najar aati he
 That is, if we look at the model, then there is a track record of the Bharatiya Janata Party, of good governance, of development
 doosraa atal ji kii sarkaar kaa endie kaa time dekhie
 By 2002, there was a mood in the country that Chalo Yaar Desh had started, the 21st century is now ours
 ye mood atal ji kii sarkaar ne endie ke samay diya tha or isliye bhartiya janata party kaa trek record he ki hamaara vijan bahut clear hota he
 Our policies are clear and our intentions are clear
 bhartiya janata party kaa menifesto dekhenge to aap aaraam se kah sakate hai ki ye sarkaar aisi chalegi, itin clearity ke saath or main by large media kaa abhaari hum ki unhone bhartiya janata party ke menifesto kaa bahut hi positive vishleshan kiya he
 Really, where do we get such a privilege? mahangaai, kharaab monsoon uske liye kya?main hairaan hum, aap itani niraashaa main kyon ji rahe ho bhai
 It is true that those who have seen so bad 10 years, it will take time to go towards hope
 gujarat hamaara 10 saal se 7 saal akaal vaala rajya rahaa he
 But there is no sign of famine from 2001 to 2014
 to mere par to bhagwaan kii itani krupa rahati he, ishwar sadaa sarvada mere saath rahata he or bharat ke log jab acha karte hai to ishwar kii krupa bharat ke logon par rahati he
 i should pray to God and all the countrymen that the monsoon be good, why think bad
 samaadhaan nahin sujhane ke masale paramain detaa hum samaadhaan
 If we want to fight corruption then there should be a state policy drive
 nitiyon ke aadhaar par desh chalanaa chahie
 The government should make its policy, what it wants to make, it can be a plus-minus point, but the decision should be made in the light of that policy
 aaj desh kaa durbhaagya he ki discrimination ke liye bahut scope he or usko dhaaran karun na karun us offis kaa yaa us ministry ke haath main rahata he or blike and white main niti he
 People can also decide by reading on the internet that i will not get entry here, will not get here
 to phir aadmi karpshan par nahin jaataa he
 Second, let me mention a small topic
 ab dekhie har noujvaan ko rojgaar chahie, bechra rojgaar ke liye tarasata he
 He passes the written exam
 ritain test main paas ho jaataa he
 Then the interview call comes
 intervyuu kol main use is baat kii chintaa nahin hoti he ki intervyuu main paas ho jaaoongaa yaa nahin ho paaungaa
 He worries that man should find a recommendation, find a broker so that i can get out of the interview
 kya is desh main sachmuch main ye intervyuu ke madhyam se in garib, madhyam vargeey pariwaron kaa lakhon rupaya tabah hota he yaa nahin hota he
 Whether or not corruption occurs
 hamane gujarat main ek prayog kiya

 In it, we gave the mark of our academy career, duty career and each one

 The computer software asked the computer that tell brother, which application should have come 40 thousand, 50 thousand, lakh, 2 lakh out of which 1300 can be the top
 computer ne nikaal diya
 No human interview
 sidhaa-sidhaa 1300 logon ko kol chalaa gaya naukari kaa
 Their widow women received orders for jobs for children
 koi karpshan nahin hua
 Corruption can be stopped
 gujarat or maharashtra ke bich karpshan rokane main doosraa mahatv kaa laabh he technology kaa
 Corruption can be prevented to a great extent by technology
 jaise mere yahaan hamen maaloom he ki bharat sarkaar ko aakhir-aakhir main paryaavaran mantri ko badalanaa padaa or log kehete hai ki jab tak jayanti tex nahin dete the tab tak file aage nahin badhati thi or mantri ke jane ke baad kehete hai ki 200 se zyada file sin kii hui kapboard se mili
 It is said that i do not know the truth
 aap hi ke madhyam se suna he
 You mean not Particular to Person, Media
 to paryaavaran mantralay file ko clear nahin karti ki unako hari bhari duniya chahie
 Need a picture of Gandhi
 hamane gujarat main kya kiya, paryaavaran clearence ke liye jo bhi file aati he sidhe online jaati he
 You can sit at home and see where your file is traveling
 kahin ruki he to aapako pataa hoga ki yahaan kyon ruki he
 Anyone can make a sound
 transparent thru technology
 i have 2 check posts in Gujarat and Maharashtra
 jo gaadi gujarat se maharashtra aati he, vahiin gaadi check post par gujarat bhi aati he
 The more tax we take, the more tax Maharashtra takes
 lekin mere yahaan 700 karod rupee kaa inakam zyada he, kyon? kyonki mere yahaan technology intervension he
 Technology reveals everything
 centrali monitor ho saktaa he
 So i have less corruption
 doosraa political vil power chahie
 Political will need power and if there is power then there is no problem
 videshi bank acount ke sawaal par
 
 
 i tell the friends of the media, if you run your channel with the Congress portfolio, i do not have to say

 Would you not accept the court? And the Purushottam Solanki talks about, there is no case for him

 Find out what happened, who did it
 kab kiya dekho or jo log ye poochhate hai unke jitne mantri jail main hai wo kitne cese chal rahe hai
 The Supreme Court had to find that the list of black money which has been received, the accounts of foreign bank were not actually giving the list to the Supreme Court

 Corruption is a sin, fight against corruption, i do not associate any person with corruption

 Theoretically, we should discuss, should corruption run in the country? Should the country be dishonest? i oppose this
 narendra modi ne baar-baar kaha he
 
 
 Leave it to others, discuss Narendra Modi
 kya narendra modi par koi gaiyr-kanoonee kaarywahi karne ke aarope lage hai, usko chaalu rakhana chahie yaa band karnaa chahie
 i say, you should keep running, all investigation should be done and Narendra Modi should go through that process
 main narendra modi bolta hum, narendra modi kanoon se upar nahin ho saktaa he, pradhanmantri ban jaaen to bhi nahin ho saktaa he
 It was nice to have Modichiya on the snuggate

 These accusations are accusations

 On the Army Chief's case, the policy of the Bharatiya Janata Party is very clear since the time of Atal ji and we are of the opinion that such a big country like India should never live with eyes
 na hi kisi ko aankh dikhaane ke liye alau karnaa chahie
 Neither in such a large country should live in global relations by bending the eyes nor should anyone be forced to bow their eyes
 sambandh aise hone chahie jo ham aankh milakar ke baat kar sake
 International relations are based on response

 uttar pradesh main is varsh hone vaale chunaavon kii taiyaari kaaphi pehle se hi partiyon ne shuru kar di thi
 Almost all the parties also released the list of candidates after considerable multiplication
 lekin, kuch pramukh dal ek-duusare ke pratyaashiyon ko dekhne or phir nae samikarnon ke hisaab se apane pratyaashiyon ke naam tay karne main lage rahe hai
 For the 403 assembly seats in UP, no major party other than BSP has been able to finalize their candidates so far
 aisa hi haal bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa he
 The party has been out of power in the state for 14 years and the party is hoping to reach power this time with the help of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 jaankaree ke anusaar pichley kaaphi samay se party kii ore se har seat par jitau pratyaashee ke liye survey karaayaa gaya
 But still the party has not been able to finalize the candidates in about 150 seats in the state
 lambey samay se is par kaaphi dimag lagane ke baad party ke yah samaj main aa gaya he ki sahi ummidavaar kaa chayan hi sabase mushkil kaam he
 Senior party leaders, who have been looking into the affairs of Uttar Pradesh for a long time, said that before the election, we do not have the right candidates for at least 150 seats
 duusare dalon ke sthapit or parakhe hue pratyaashiyon ko lenaa ek kargar upaay sa dikhaai diya he
 Sources say that this is the reason that the party has announced to give tickets to the list of candidates so far released to about 50 leaders from other parties
 rajya main 403 siton main se bijepi 371 siton par chunaav lard rahi he or baaki siton par party ke sahyogi dalon ke pratyaashee chunavi maidan main honge
 It is a different matter that such a decision of the party has caused anger among activists and other leaders associated with the party and working for the party for years
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki is sabakaa kaaran bhi yah he ki party main pehle oonchi jati waalon kaa bolbalaa rahaa he
 The upper caste people have been given more tickets earlier
 jo batch jaataa tha vah anya logon ko diya jaataa tha
 But now everything has changed
 bijepi ko apane puraane vot bank ko bhi barkarar or nae samudaay ke logon ko bhi jodna he jinaki sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 BJP sources say that the party has full support of any one community like the Samajwadi Party has support of Yadavs and Mayawati has support of a large section of the Dalit community
 bijepi abhi tak anya partiyon se naaraaz logon or apni bhaavnaatmak apil kaa sahaara leti he or isi ke sahare yadav-muslim or dalit-muslim jaise taqatvar gathjod se loha liya he
 In the 2014 general election, BJP won 71 out of 80 seats in the state as non-yadav Other Backward Classes and Extremely Backward Classes voted for the party
 in jatiyon ke logon ko party ke samarthan main banaae rakhane ke liye party ne 40 fisadi siton par inhen jatiyon main se netaaon ko utaara he
 The party has given tickets to Brahmin and upper caste candidates in 22 percent of the seats, while in 18 seats it has given tickets to Banias or people from the merchant community
 is baar yah samudaay jiesti or notebandi kii vajah se party se thodaa naaraaz he, lekin yah hameshaa se party ke saath rahaa he
 The comments rajya main bhale hi bijepi 2014 ke karishme ko doharaate hue satta main vaapasi karnaa chaahati he lekin party ke netaa yah maan rahe hai ki vidhansabha chunaav puri tarah se alag hota he
 Party sources say 2014 was a Modi wave and many new leaders also won the election
 is samay log congress se puri tarah naaraaz bhi the
 In these assembly elections, we need 5 times the candidates for the Lok Sabha elections, and there is no wave at this time and that is why the party is trying to pacify the angry leaders and workers by not getting tickets
 ullekhneey he ki rajya main saat charnon main chunaav hone hai jo 11 farvari se prarambh ho rahe he or 11 march ko chunaavon kaa parinaam aayega
 According to the information, a survey has been conducted on every seat from the party for the winner of the seat
 lekin ab bhi party rajya kii kareeb 150 siton par pratyaashiyon ko antim rup nahin de pai he
 After putting a lot of mind on it for a long time, it has become understood by the party that choosing the right candidate is the most difficult task
 party ke varisht netaa, jo kaaphi samay se uttar pradesh ke maamalon ke dekh rahe hai, ne kaha ki chunaav se pehle hamaare paas kam se kam 150 siton par sahi ummidavaar nahin hai
 Taking established and tested candidates of other parties has appeared as an effective solution
 sutron kaa kahana he ki yahi kaaran he ki duusare dalon se aae kareeb 50 netaaon ko party ne abhi tak jari pratyaashiyon kii suchi main tikat dene kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Out of 403 seats in the state, BJP is contesting 371 seats and candidates of allies of the party will be contesting the remaining seats
 yah alag baat he ki party ke aise faisle se saalon se party se jude or party ke liye kaam kar rahe kaaryakartaaon or anya netaaon main gussa he
 Party sources say that the reason for all this is that the upper caste people have been dominant in the party before
 oonchi jati waalon ko hi pehle zyada tikat die jate rahe hai
 What was left was given to other people
 lekin ab sab badal gaya he
 The BJP also has to add its old vote bank to the people of Barkar and new community, whose number is very high
 bijepi sutron kaa kahana he ki party ko kisi bhi ek samudaay kaa puraa samarthan hai jaise ki samaajawaadee party ko yadavon kaa or mayawati ko dalit samudaay ke ek bade hisse kaa samarthan he
 The BJP has so far resorted to angry people from other parties and its emotional appeal and has taken on powerful alliances like yadav-muslim and dalit-muslim
 2014 ke aam chunaav main bijepi ne rajya kii 80 main se 71 siton par vijay hasil kii thi kyonki gaiyr-yadav anya pichhadaa varg or ati pichhadaa varg ne party ke liye vot kiya tha
 In order to retain the people of these castes in support of the party, the party has fielded leaders from these castes on 40 per cent seats
 party ne 22 pratishat siton par brahman or ucch jatiyon ke pratyaashiyon ko tikat diya he jabaki 18 siton par baniyaa yaa vyapaaree samudaay ke logon ko tikat diya he
 This time the community is a little annoyed with the party because of GST and demonetisation, but it has always been with the party
 tippaniyan Though the BJP wants to return to power in the state by repeating the charisma of 2014, the party leaders are assuming that the assembly elections are completely different
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki 2014 modi lahar thi or kai nae netaa bhi chunaav jeet gaye
 At this time people were also completely angry with the Congress
 in vidhansabha chunaav main hamen loksabhaa chunaav ke mukaable 5 guna pratyaashiyon kii darkaar he, or is samay koi lahar nahin he or yahi vajah he ki party tikat na milane se naaraaz netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko shant karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 It is noteworthy that elections are to be held in seven phases in the state which starts on February 11 and the results of elections will come on March 11

 In the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, on Wednesday, East Delhi MP Mahesh Giri has demanded the reunification of the three mcds of Delhi
 mahesh giri ne is dauraan bataaya ki wo is bare main piem modi ko bhi patr likh kar avgat kara chuke hai
 The three mcds of Delhi, Khastahalagiri, alleged that neither the Congress nor the Aam Aadmi Party are now worrying after the distribution of the corporations, which is suffering due to the three corporations as well as the people of Delhi
 giri ne is dauraan kaha ki dilli kii teenon emsidi khastahal hai or apane karmchaariyon ko vakt par selary de paane main asamarth hai
 The sweepers go on strike every day and the people of Delhi have to live in the midst of the mess
 2012 main hua tha vibhaajangiri ne sansad main kaha ki purvi dilli nagar nigam kii haalat sabase zyada kharaab he kyonki isaki aay kaa pramukh hissaa property tex, parking, vigyaapan or dilli sarkaar ke plan fund se aata he, lekin dilli sarkaar fund detii nahin or purvi dilli main zyaadaatar anaadhikrut coloniyon ke kaaran rajasav mil nahin paata
 Mahesh Giri said in Parliament that Delhi cannot be kept clean without merging the three mcds
 isliye teenon emsidi ko phir se ek kar diya jaae
 Let us tell you that in 2012, Sheila Dixit divided MCD into East, North and South MCD

 mewar or meerut main kashmiri chaatro par hamale kii ghatnaon kii bhatsargana karte hue kaha tha ki kashmiri bhi desh ke naagarik hai
 Fraternity should be shown with them
 saath hi grahamantri ne desh ke sabhi rajyon ko nirdesh diya ki ve kashmiriyon ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaaen
 In fact, nowadays Delhi government is divided into two parts
 ek he chuni hui kejariwal sarkaar or duusari naukarshahi jo sidhe up rajyapal ke nirdesh par kaam karti he
 The lieutenant governor is the only surveyor within Delhi
 isliye beete kuch samay se chuni hui aam aadmi party kii sarkaar or afasaron main khinchataan chal rahi he
 AAP government ministers say that officers do not work as they say, whereas we are accountable to the public
 to duusari or afasar kehete hai ve niyam ke tahat hi kaam kar rahe hai
 This order of Satyendra Jain is part of the same controversy
 darasal aajkal dilli sarkaar do hisson main banty hui he
 One is the elected Kejriwal government and the other is the bureaucracy which works directly on the instructions of the Lieutenant Governor
 dilli ke andar up rajyapal hi sarvesarva hai
 Therefore, there has been a lot of tussle between the elected Aam Aadmi Party government and officers for some time
 aap sarkaar ke mantri kehete hai ki afasar unke kehane se kaam nahin karte jabaki janata ke prati hamaari javabdehi hai
 So the other officers say they are working under the rule
 satyendra jain kaa yah aadesh usee vivaad kaa hissaa he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the name of the Constituent Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar will now be changed
 bhimrao ambedkar ke naam ke saath ab unke pita 'raamji malogy sakapaal' kaa naam bhi joda jayega
 The Yogi government has taken this decision following the advice of Governor Ram Naik
 ab unka naam 'dow
 Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar '
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki rajyapal ramanike ne isko lekar 2017 main ek campan chalaaya tha
 During this time he also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra main bhi unke naam ke saath pita kaa naam joda jaataa he
 The Uttar Pradesh government has now given orders in this matter, after which the name was officially changed to Dr
 bhimrao raamji ambedkar ho jayega
 The government has also given instructions for all necessary changes in the records
 ram nike naam main badlaav ke liye pichley ek saal se abhiyaan chalaa rahe the
 He had also cited the document for change in name, which included the name 'ramji' in Bhimrao Ambedkar's signatures
 udit raaj hue naarajais faisle par bijepi saansad udit raaj ne aapatti darj kii he
 He said that Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar ke naam ke madhya main raamji likhe jane se anaavashyak vivaad khadaa kiya gaya he
 Dalits are also angry with this
 udit raaj kaa kahana he ki iskaa pratikul asar padataa dikh rahaa he or subah se hi kai jagahon se khabar ai hai, whatsapp par bhi lagaataar chal rahaa he ki naam kyon badla gaya he
 It is said that the 'messiah of Dalits'! It is noteworthy that Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, who shaped the constitution of the country, was born on April 14, 1891
 dow
 Bhimrao Ambedkar was born in a small village in Madhya Pradesh
 bhimrao ambedkar ke pita kaa naam raamji malogy sakapaal or mata kaa bhimabai tha
 Dr
 bhimrao ambedkar apane mata-pita kii 14veen santan the
 He went abroad to earn an economics doctorate degree, he was the first Indian to do so
 jab vah 1926 main bharat aae tab unhen mumbai kii vidhansabha kaa sadsy chunaa gaya
 He is considered the main creator of the Constitution of India
 vah aaazaad desh ke pehle kanoon mantri bane
 He was awarded India's highest honor 'bharat Ratna' in the year 1990
 dow
 Bhimrao Ambedkar was the first to raise his voice against the evil of untouchability, discrimination against Dalits, women and laborers
 saal 1956 main unhone buddha dharm apana liya, jiske kaaran lakhon daliton ne aisa kiya
 He died on 6 December 1956 after suffering from diabetes
 may, 2011 main bharat se sevaaon kaa niryaat april ke mukaable 3

 The Reserve Bank said in a statement that 11 out of the country in April 2011

 97 billion dollars
 sevaaon ke aayaat-niryaat ko lekar pehali baar aankade 15 june ko jari kiye gaye
 These figures were for April 2011
 number cheez hi aisi he, jisaki sarkaar hoti he, uske hisaab se bolte hai
 You may have heard the figures are slaves of governments, but if you want to understand, listen to the speech of the Union Agriculture Minister in the Lok Sabha
 kah rahe the ki maharashtra main sirf teen kisaanon ne maut ko gale lagaaya pichley teen maheenon main, yani bemausam barish or ole ke baad
 The government is considering these three also because the farmers died after writing that why are they committing suicide? The rest of the 558 farmers who have died in the state between January and March 2015 have made a technical mistake in the eyes of the government
 marane ke pehle ye nahin bataa kar gaye ki kyon ja rahe hai duniya se, isliye inako hamaari sarkaar dehaat main faile avsaad kaa hissaa nahin maan sakati
 She does not believe that unseasonal rains and hail forced these farmers to die
 kendriya krishi mantri galat nahin hai ki mare to sirf 3 kisaan hai
 Everyone else succumbed to government theory
 aaj akshay tritiya he
 Farmers worship and sow the Kharif crop, but the whole family embraced death in a village in Akola
 paanch logon ke shav khet se mili
 The government made up the story
 There was a dispute over the land of the farmer
 vidarbha, marathavada ke kisaanon kii koi bhi kahani uthaa kar dekh lijiye aapako har sarkari kahani main dam nazar aayega
 Everyone's patterns are almost the same
 khudakushi ke turant baad police maukey par jaaegi
 Top officers will get a notice
 sabase pehle paariwarik vazah khoji jaaengi
 If she is found then the work of the government is complete
 media ko bataa diya jayega ki kisaan apane karmon kii vazah se mar gaya he
 And if the family does not get it, then the remaining work will complete the story of Daru
 zyada peetaa tha, karj main tha, isaliye mar gaya bechaara
 Till now i have not found any such data which suggests that farmers of Vidarbha and Marathwada drink more than other areas of the country
 tippaniyan Don't be surprised that there are cms in the state who used to shout at the death toll a few months from now
 puri duniya ko bataate the ki kaise vidarbha or marathavada ke kisaanon ke saath ninsaphi hui he
 No water is available for irrigation, so the farmer is committing suicide
 vidarbha main jamkar prachaar hua
 Narendra Modi himself came to discuss tea
 yavatmal main ek shaam kisaanon ke saath baat kii
 i also went there that day
 modi ji kisaanon kii vidhwaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Nothing has changed since then
 sinchai kii yojanaayen ab ratorat to ban nahin sakati, isaliye ye maanane main koi harj nahin ki ninsaphi jari he
 It is just a complaint that when people are dying, why are we not agreeing? sarkari mahakme media ko galat sabit karne main mehnat kyon kar rahe hai ? Governments should show some mercy, figures are your slaves, order them to tell the truth
 bataaen ki har wo kisaan jo mar rahaa he uske marane kii fori vajah kuch or ho sakati he lekin bade paimaane par uske aasapaas ke halaat use jeene nahin de rahe
 Today is Akshaya Tritiya
 kisaan pujan kar kharif kii fasal bote hai, lekin akola ke ek gaanv main puure parivaar ne maut ko gale laga liya
 The bodies of five people met the farm
 sarkaar ne kahani banaai kisaan kaa zamin ko lekar vivaad chal rahaa tha
 Pick up any story of the farmers of Vidarbha, Marathwada and see the power of every government story
 sabake pattern lagbhag ek sareekhe hai
 Police will go to the scene soon after the suicide
 aalaa afasaron ko ittala milegi
 First the family will be discovered
 vah mil gai to sarkaar kaa kaam puraa
 The media will be told that the farmer has died due to his deeds
 or agar paariwarik vazah na mili to samajhiye bachaa hua kaam daaru kii kahani puri kar degi
 He used to drink more, was in debt, so the poor guy died
 ab tak mujhe aisa koi aankada nahin mila he, jo bataae ki vidarbha or marathavada ke kisaan desh ke duusare ilaakon kii tulana main zyada pite hai
 The comments tajjub na kariye ki rajya main vahi siem hai, jo maut ke aankadon par ab se kuch maheene pehle cheekhte the
 Used to tell the whole world how injustice has been done to the farmers of Vidarbha and Marathwada
 sinchai ke liye pani nahin mila he isaliye kisaan khudakushi kar rahaa he
 There was a lot of publicity in Vidarbha
 khud narendra modi chaay par charchaa ke liye aae
 One evening in Yavatmal talked with the farmers
 main bhi us din vahaan gaya tha
 Modi ji met the widows of the farmers
 tab se ab tak badla kuch nahin he
 Irrigation plans can no longer be made overnight, so there is no harm in assuming that injustice is going on
 bas shikaayat he to itani-si ki jab log mar rahe hai to ham maan kyon nahin rahe
 Why are government departments trying hard to prove the media wrong? sarkarein thodi-si dayaa dikhaaen, aankade aapke gulam hai, unako hukum den ki wo sach bataaen
 Explain that every farmer who is dying may be the immediate reason for his death but on a large scale the circumstances around him are not allowing him to live

 china ke ek purv rajanyik ne kaha he ki saal 1988 main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ke china daure se donon deshon ke sambandhon main garmjoshi ai thi
 Rajiv Gandhi's visit played an important role in the restoration and development of relations between the two countries

 According to the report, the funniest twists will be seen this time in the show
 iaiti or central uniwarsities main deshbhakti jagaae rakhane ke liye modi sarkaar ne ek anokhaa tarika nikaala he
 Now, in these educational institutions, students will be seen hosting 'patriotic Music Bands', not djs or rock concerts
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne yah nirdesh swatantraaa ke 70 saal or bharat chodo andolan ke 75 saal puraa hone in sansthaanon ko die hai
 As per instructions issued on 21 August to the Vice Chancellors and Directors of 75 institutes, this concert will be hosted under the 'yeh India Ka Time Hai' event
 iske alaava 'new india manthan' kaa bhi seshan saath hoga
 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is identifying music bands through the National Film Development Corporation
 ek senior adhikari ne bataaya ki, 'ek privet antertenment company ko mujeec bainds chunane kaa kaam diya he
 Till now more than a dozen rock bands are in talks
 agle maah se alag-alag santhaan main ye bainds parform karenge
 In the directive issued by the government, the IIT and Central Universities have been asked to select students from the appropriate Venue and provide them with information about these bands and also maintain 'suitable decorations' during the performance
 vipaksh ne uthaae sawaal
 
 
 The opposition has raised questions on this event
 eimm ke chif or saansad asaduddin ovaisi ne kaha ki, 'rock band ko iaiti main bhejne ke peeche sarkaar kaa kya makasad he? modi sarkaar ab tak logon kaa kuch bhala nahin kar saki he
 This is a strategy to divide students
 iaiti innovations ke liye he naa kii band party ke liye
 Explain that this month, on Independence Day, the government had instructed the university and educational institutions to take freedom fighters and martyr memorials
 saarvajanik kshetra ke bank rin raahat yojana ke tahat kisaanon ko or riyaayat de sakate hai, basharte ve sarkaar se uski bharpai ke liye na kahen
 Under the government's debt relief scheme, also known as a one-time settlement OTS, 25 per cent of the loan was waived by bank farmers paying up to 75 per cent of the total loan amount
 yah yojana un rinon ke liye he, jinka bhugtan 31 disambar 2007 tak kiya janaa tha or jo 29 farvari 2008 tak nahin chukaaya ja sakaa tha
 Government will not compensate for the difference, a recent notification of the Reserve Bank of India said that now the government can settle the banks with farmers even on payment of less than 75 percent provided they do not ask the government to repay the remaining amount
 
 arabiai ne kaha, ''sarkaar ne bainkon vittiya sansthaanon ko otias ke tahat 75 pratishat se kam rin vasuuli ko manjuuri de di he, lekin ve antar kii bharpai ke liye na to sarkaar or na hi kisaanon se kahenge
 The central bank said that it will compensate the banks for 25 percent loan amount under this scheme
 sarkaar ne iske alaava otias yojana main kuch or badlaav kiye hai
 1 crore farmers will get benefit, before this farmers were asked to pay this amount in 3 installments
 pehali kist jamaa karne kii taarikh 30 sitambar 2008 se badhaakar 31 march 2009 kar di gai thi, lekin duusari or teesri kist kii taarikh ko kramash: 31 march 2009 or 30 june 2009 par barkaraar rakhaa gaya tha
 Now the government has said that those farmers will also get the benefit of OTS scheme, who will pay 75 percent amount at one time by June 30 this year
 arabiai ke mutabik sarkaar ne bainkon se kaha he ki ve 30 june tak kisaanon se koi byaaj na vasuul kare
 About one crore farmers are expected to benefit from the OTS scheme
 uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ne soobe ke 41 iees adhikariyon ke tabadale kar die hai
 This is the second biggest reshuffle of the Yogi government after the formation of the BJP government in UP
 is pherbadal ke tahat yogesh shukla ko rajya sampatti adhikari banaaya gaya he, jabaki rajeev rotela ko gorakhpur kaa jila adhikari banaaya gaya he
 Apart from this, Ashish Goyal has been made the Allahabad Kaga Commissioner
 isse pehle uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne prashasnic mahakamen main bada pherbadal karte hue20 iees adhikariyonke tabadale kar die the
 This time too, the Yogi government entrusted many responsibilities to many officials, and cut them on many
 pehle pherbadal ke tahat mrityunjay kumaar narayan ko mukhyamantri kaa sachiv banaaya gaya, jabaki navaneet sahagal ko soochna evam paryaton sachiv pad se hataakar unka prabhaar avinaash avasthi ko saunp diya gaya
 At the same time, Anita Meshram was made the secretary of child development and nutrition department and RP Singh was made the principal secretary of mining
 iske alaava pichhali sarkaar main chahete rahe rama raman ko noida vikaas praadhikaran ke pramukh sachiv pad se hataakar unki jagah alok sinha ko prabhaar saunpa gaya
 His wife Shilpa Shetty reached Siddhivinayak after the Delhi Police sent an interrogation love letter to Rajasthan Royals owner Raj Kundra after MCOCA was imposed on three players
 lekin puja se poochtacha kaa kya lenaa dena
 Poolis asked all he had to ask
 sutara bataate hai ki sawaal kuch yun the
 - Why did your friend meet Siddharth Trivedi, and get information? - Did you know that there is an intrusion in the team of bookies? - On whose recommendation Chandila was taken into the team? - Who is the owner of the team, in your team What is the share? - What role does Shilpa Shetty play in the team? - Who can go to the players in the hotel? - 3 of your players are stuck in spot fixing, did you know? - About the bookies Did the ICC or BCCI give any indication? - Do you know the bookies? - Was there any suspicious information about Sreesanth? - Did the management paint the players any more than their fees? - Is there any in Rajasthan Royals Vigilance unit works? - Did Ajit Chandila ever introduce you to a fixer or bookie? - Did anyone ask for information about the match, before or after the match? Apart from the official party, vahiin raaj kundra ke jis dost umesh goyanka kaa zikr siddharth trivedi ne kiya tha wo ab phixing maamle main sarkari gavaah banane ko taiyaar ho gaye hai
 Delhi Police has imposed MCOCA on the entire spot fixing case
 dilli police kaa daawa he ki uske paas is baat ke mukammal saboot hai ki phixing ke taar sidhe daaud ibrahim or uske sabase kareebi chota shakeel se jude hue hai
 For this reason, along with other accused, Sreesanth was also sent to judicial custody till June 18
 raaj kundra or shilpa shetty ke liye un sawaalon se ab takaraana hi hoga jinase wo kataraate rahe hai
 Anuj Mishra and Nitin Jain together dilli pahunche baba ramdev ne sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa

 ramdev ne kaha ki sarkaar bhrashtachari hi nahin ab atyaachaari bhi ho gai he
 Ramdev said that those who raise voice against corruption can be persecuted, they cannot be eradicated
 unhone kaha ki agar bhrashtachar kaa mudda uthaanaa gunaah he, to ham lakh baar gunaah karenge
 Ramdev also said that whoever is against corruption, any person, institution or party will support him
 ramdev ne ramlila maidan main hui police karrwai ko barbartapurna karrwai bataate hue kaha ki police unhen maar daalana chaahati thi
 Ramdev alleged that his female supporters were even tried for rape
 ramdev ne kaha ki agar vah galat the, to phir pradhanmantri ne unhen patr kyon likhaa or kyon centre ke bade-bade mantri unase mulaakaat karte rahe
 Ramdev said that he is not the mask of any party
 unke liye kalaadhan or bhrashtachar kaa mudda sabase ahm he or vah iske liye hameshaa aawaaj uthaate rahenge
 This method of assessing one's life among the most well-liked public figures in India can be termed reckless, but let's first take a look at the things that the late former President of India, Abdul Kalamka had nothing to do with
 paramparaagat arthon main dekhen to ve vastav main koi vaigyanik nahin the, kyonki unke paas paryaapt prakashit shodhpatr maujuud nahin the
 He was not even the father of the country's atomic bomb because it was developed by two generations of scientists of the Department of Atomic Energy
 unke paas bhaashan kala bhi koi khaas nahin thi or ve aksar apane hi uddharanon ko doharaate rahete the
 He was neither a scholar nor a particular writer like his predecessors
 unhone shaadi nahin kii, isliye ve paariwarik kism keshakhsbhi nahin the or unke koi baccha bhi nahin tha
 Nor was he a leader or public figure from his training or background, much of his life was spent in the mysterious world of weapon manufacturing
 ve sanskrit ke shlokon kaa vaachan or rudra veena kaa vaadan pasand karte the or ek saadhaaran aasthavan musalmaan the
 Now think about where they got from
 ve sivi raman or jagadish chandra bose jaise hamaare sarvakalik mahaan vaigyanikon kii qatari main shaamil ho gaye or apane purvavarti guruon kii peedi se aane vaale homi bhabha yaa vikram sarabhai tathaa diei, isro or diardio ke sahakarmiyon se bhiaage nikal gaye
 They have settled in our memories as one who provided us with the capability of nuclear prohibition
 pichhali kuch peedhishon, bhugolikataaon or aabaadiyon ke bich ve hamaare sabase lokapriy vaktaa ke rup main sthapit ho gaye or kabhi bhi aisa nahin hua ki unke bhaashan vaale khachaakhach bhare sabhaagaar main log khadey na rahe hon
 The books he wrote, such as India 2020, may fall under the category of most sermons, yet they proved to be the best-selling non-fiction books in our history and will hold this status for a long time
 hamaare bacchon ne chachaa nehru ke baad agar sabase zyada kisi netaa ko pyaar diya to ve kalam the
 His stature grew so dramatically that he proved to be our most political president even though the process was highly judicious and fair
 sabhi samudaay unhen chaahate the, un par bharosa karte the, lekin ve ek aise musalmaan ke rup main ubhare jise hamaare samooche itihaas main bharat kii bahusankhyak hindu janata ne sabase zyada pyaar diya
 The only exception to this can be Emperor Akbar, about whom extremely liberal historians have such an opinion
 or ant main, apni moti chamadi ke baavjood jis ek tathy ko main khud ginane se darataa rahaa hum ki ve kya nahin the, vah yah he ki unke paas piechdi kii oopaadhi nahin thi
 All his doctoral degrees were honorary, yet how much did the 'doctor' fit before his name, and even his bitter critics — most of whom are within the power establishment associated with nuclear weapons — avoided saying it publicly
 sawaal uthta he ki unke bheetar aisa kya tha jisane unhen itnaa zyada pyaar or sammaan bakhsha
 The moral strength he possessed would hardly have been anything since independence
 awwal to, yah unki vinamrata se aati thi
 You must have never heard that they have ever taken any credit for the achievements of ISRO-DRDO, ever made a pomp, said anything against anyone or complained
 haa, jindagi bhar naukarshahi kii moti diwaar ke peeche chupe ek vaigyanik-abhiyantriki pratishthan main kaam karne vaale ek shaks ke taur par unke khate main bhi kuch shikaayatein beshak thim
 Yet they never brought them to the fore, nor did they make these complaints an excuse for failures
 maine unki aalochana main april 2001 main isi sheershak ke stambh ke do lekh likhe the jisamen pehle kaa sheershak tha ''kalams bananaa republic
 "one evening after that i almost bumped into him while running in Delhi's Sirifort campus, where he used to walk
 ve tab khelgaumv main diardio ke guestaouse main rahete the
 They caught that i was stealing eyes from them
 ve muskaraate hue ruke or kaha ki ve bataanaa chaah rahe the ki unhen vah lekh padhakar kitna anand aayaa tha or kaise ve usase puri tarah sahamat the
 i was looking at the look of sarcasm on his face when he said, "I hope the authorities will read it too
" diardio main bahut gambhir chunautiyaan or khamiyaan hai
 We have to do something
 '' kalam ko jo bhi lambey samay se jaanate hai, unhen pataa he ki ve safagoi se bolte the
 His nomination as President was the masterstroke of vajpayee-advani
 vah desh kii pehali bijepi aguai vaali sarkaar thi or unhen is baat kaa ilm tha ki is sarkaar ko samaveshi dikhne kii jarurat he
 Obviously, any Muslim who is also a national hero would have proved to be a thistle for them, but the way Kalam handled this responsibility over time, he must have surprised them too
 pakistan ke saath gatirodh ke dauraan (oparation parakram) unki upasthiti bahut aashwast karne vaali thi jab kam se kam saal bhar tak ham jang ke kagaar par khadey rahe the
 Apart from this, he also gave the reassuring touch that the country needed after the Gujarat riots
 unhone kaaphi paripakvata ke saath is maamle main hastkshep kiya or khud ko bilkul bhi pakshdhar nahin dikhne diya, baavjood iske yah sandesh dene main ve kaamyaab rahe ki ve kya soch rahe the
 His intervention was so effective and so subtle that the respect of Hindus towards him continued to grow in the coming times
 kalam kii viraasat haalanki iske mukaable kahin zyada bhavy he
 How grand this legacy was can be understood from former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's interview to Karan Thapar for India Today group
 unhone hamen yaad dilaayaa ki kalam ke hastkshep ke bagaiyr america ke saath parmaanu sauda nahin ho saktaa tha
 As soon as the monsoon session of Parliament began in 2008, Prakash Karat announced that he was withdrawing his support from the UPA and would vote with the BJP to topple the government on the nuclear deal issue, suddenly figures in front of Manmohan Singh Problem arose
 manmohan singh kii sarkaar na sirf batch gai balki mulaayam singh yadav ke sahyog se usne apni sabase jokhim bhari siyaasi jang ko jeet bhi liya
 Mulayam Singh was initially against the nuclear deal due to his huge Muslim vote bank
 congress ne mulaayam se sampark saadhaa or pichley daravaaje se lenden kii sambhaavna par vichaar kiya jane laga
 Mulayam just needed an assurance
 isamen kalam kaam aae kyonki unhone saude ke paksh main apane haath majbootee se aage badha die
 From then on, Mulayam Singh and Amar Singh looked like a parrot only if Dr
 kalam kah rahe hai to yah thik hi hoga
 If you look at the parliamentary debates on that confidence vote, you will find how strongly Asaduddin Owaisi defended the nuclear deal while raising his politics headlong
 iske peeche bhi kalam kaa hi haath tha
 Surprisingly, this intervention is rarely remembered even today and it is not mentioned prominently in the numerous memoirs written on Kalam
 tathy yah he ki tab tak na sirf 'sexlary' dalon balki parmaanu-vaigyanik pratishthan ko bhi is baat par paryaapt andeh tha ki yah sauda sainya or naagarik istemaal ke riektaron ko alag se barat paaegaa
 Kalam worked to remove these fears and only because for him it was the nation first
 sirf saal bhar pehle congress ne unhen doosraa kaarykaal dene se inkaar karke unhen sharminda kiya tha or ve sabaki sahmati hone ke baad is par raji the
 Congress vetoed it
 kalam ke liye yah mauka adarsh tha ki ve upie ke saath apane sambandhon ko durust kar lete or saath hi bijepi kaa bhi ehsaan chukaa pate jisane unhen bharat ratna or raashtrapati pad kii saugat di thi
 This shows that there were some other things which were not in Kalam
 masalan, ve tuchche nahin the, nirashaavadi nahin the
 He was also not selfish, vengeful, principled and egotistical
 yahi vajah he ki ek arab se zyada kii aabaadi unhen beete tamaam dashakon ke dauraan apane sabase chahete netaa ke taur par yaad rakhegi
 PS: My favorite chapter about Kalam is very early
 isro main 1994 main jasusi kaa ek maamla saamana aayaa tha
 It was said — and there was a broad consensus — that two top ISRO scientists were caught by the Pakistani intelligence agency using two women from the Maldives and both of them told Pakistan the secret secret of the rocket
 
 india today ke liye is khabar par kaam karte hue maine paaya ki samoochee kahani hi sandigdh or kapol kalpit he
 The story published by the magazine completely dismantled the Kerala Police and Intelligence Bureau edition and the scientists were left with all due respect
 aakhir, unke upar se mukademe waapas le liye gaye or supreme court ne unhen nakad muaavje kaa aadesh diya
 Initially though going against this all-round story was going to cause a lot of tension and even though there was no internet in those days, we still had to hear a lot of abuses
 is ghatana ke baad diardio ke tatkaaleen pramukh kalam ne 15 janvari ko sena diwas ke resepshan par mujhe kuch baat karne ke liye bulaayaa
 He gently kneaded the left side of my chest and said that what you have done is like healing the wounds of our heart
 maine unase poocha ki aakhir maajaraa kya tha
 He said that those scientists are completely innocent and are good people
 unhone kaha ki yah jhootha maamla mere isro ko barabaad kar saktaa tha (jahaan ve pehle kaam karte the)

 -input bhashaa se Famous rapper and singer Hard Kaur came on stage to tell the story of his first song at the India Today Mind Rocks Summit-2013
 ye naam kaa kya panga haitaran cor dhillon yun hi hard cor nahin ban gayi
 While sharing the story, he told, "when i started singing there was industry mail dominating in the UK
" meraa jajba dekhakar daadi maa kahati thim ki tera naam taran cor nahin, hard cor hona chahie
 Since then i have become a hard mouth
 chhi india se ai he12 saal lage yah tay karne main ki singer bananaa he
 You have to become a rapper in that too
 tab ladke bhi rap nahin karte the
 Mother asked, Are you sure you don't want to be a doctor? It was then that i would become a First Indian female rapper
 main india se euke gai thi
 The people there felt that the Chhi came from India, the people there did not know anything
 isi junun main sab shuru hua
 i had to be a footballer: Leander Paes first thought what this saddi kudi is doing
 12 saal maine hard kor hip hop kiya, rap kiya
 Then people outside realized that it can
 india kii ladki kar sakati he
 The first Bollywood song was hop hop
 mamma bole ki indian logon ke liye bhi kuch bana de
 Aunt used to say what she keeps doing
 to maine sochaa ki kuch aisa gaanaa banaati hum ki sabake sir par jaakar lage
 So the Daru song of women made like this, 'ek Gilasi do Gilasi'
 jab kuch acha karnaa chaha, to logon ne interest nahin dikhaaya, jab masti main kuch bhi bana diya ye gilaasi superhit ho gaya
 It is a reverse world, do the opposite
 to phir suna jaae
 
 
 One glass two two glass three three glass four
 
 
 or phir aata he stage par dhol, shuru hota he bhangda
 
 chak de fatti
 
 yangsters ke saath dance ke baad auditorium kaa energy level agle level par pahunch gaya he
 After this show of Hard Kaur, everyone's heart has become soft
 aagaaj main 'antariksh' ne jamaaya rangamera sab yangsters ko bas yahi kahana he ki jo tumhen sahi lag rahaa he, jisamen tumhaara ji lag rahaa he, use karo, tabhi kamyaabi kaa majaa milegaa
 Question and answer can be given a message in the society through round-wrap? Rap does not sell on looks
 jab maine shuru kiya tha tab yahi tha ki country ko mujeec kaa ek nayaa johnor bataanaa he
 Now even a rickshaw-maker raps
 to ab duusare level par janaa he

 To call Delhi election is just an assembly election
 sirf 70 siton vaali
 But the entire nation is eyeing this
 isliye nahin ki muqabla rochak he
 Kejriwal and Bedi are face to face
 balki isliye ki yadi bijepi haar gai to kya hoga
 Let us take this imagination forward and try to understand what will be the meaning of bjp's defeat - Modi - In 2001, he was given power in Gujarat, he has been unbeatable ever since
 har tarah ke liye virodhiyon ke liye
 Within and outside the party as well
 har paristhiti ko apane paksh main modate hue ve yah karnama karte aae hai
 After hat-trick in Gujarat directly to the post of Prime Minister
 safal safar
 Unabated
 yadi bijepi kii haar hoti he to sabase bada fark modi kii body language par padegaa
 For five years, Modi, who has won the victory over the entire country, will continue to prick that the rule of Lutyens in which he lives is that of Kejriwal
 ve virdohi dalon ko janata dwaara sire se khaarij kar die jane kaa daawa karte hai, lekin ab ve aisa nahin kar paaenge
 Even if the BJP shies away from it, the defeat will be considered Modi
 kyonki unhone apane naam par hi bedi ke liye vot maange the
 After the victory in Amit shah-lok Sabha, Shah was accepted as Chanakya of electoral politics not only in BJP but also in other parties
 unki banaai har ranneeti safal rahi
 He also brought unprecedented success to the party in the election of other states after Lok Sabha
 maano har paristhiti ko bhaanpane kaa unke paas ek jaadui chashma he or safalataa kii sabhi chaabiyaan apane paas rakhte hai
 But, if BJP loses in Delhi, then the biggest gritty will be of Amit Shah
 unheen ke ishaare par chunaav kaa time tay hua, unheen ne dilli bijepi kii ore se sabhi faisle liye
 He brought Kiran Bedi
 prachaar kii sabhi ranneeti unhone banaai
 If it fails now, it will be assumed that not every target of Shah is infallible
 bijepi-loksabhaa chunaav main jeet ke baad bijepi sanghathan kaa mishan puure desh main party ko usee tarah sthapit karne kaa he, jaisaa ki aazaadee ke baad congress ne kiya tha
 It is strengthening its base from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Gujarat to Arunachal
 bijepi kii kaaya majboot bhi ho rahi he
 But Delhi's defeat will be like a hole in the heart of that strong body of BJP
 sangh or bijepi main wo dhada jo modi ke kaamkaaj ko lekar asantusht najar aata rahaa he, vah mukhar hoga
 Kejriwal - Within a year, he has seen every high and low
 ve ab raajnneeti ke khel main manze hue netaa kahe ja sakate hai
 Unprecedented victory in Delhi assembly elections in late 2013
 phir istipha
 After that, in the Lok Sabha elections, the party's nationwide gritty
 khud kejariwal kii banaras se jabardast paraajay
 And now again on the throne of Delhi
 form main chal rahe modi or bijepi ko patkhni dekar
 First leader to crack Modi's puzzle
 kai virodhabhasi netaaon se bhari hui aam aadmi party main apni aawaaj or majboot hogi
 Now the challenge for him will be to re-emerge himself on national politics
 rashtriya raajnneeti-anti-modi kheme ko sirf isi kaa to intjaar tha
 With this failure of Modi and BJP, not only the Congress, every party will get new energy
 modi or bijepi kaa khub majaak banaaya jayega
 Efforts will be made to bring Modi and his team under pressure
 yahi mauka hoga ki lalu, mulaayam tisare morche main ek baar phir praan foonkane kii koshish karenge
 Elections are to be held in Bihar this year
 niveshak-pichley dinon khabar ai ki sau badi companiyon ke siio ne bijepi jwine kii he
 The business world is not only looking at Modi for the next five years but for Modi for ten years
 lekin raajnneetik paristhitiyon kaa barometer to share bazaar bhi he
 The way the Sensex dived on Friday, analysts saw it linked to the Delhi election
 maano modi kaa bharosa tut gaya ho
 It is too hasty, but if BJP loses in this election, Modi will need to take investors back to confidence again

 co / ygwwo1godb — Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) April 19, 2019 Asaduddin Owaisi said that we say that Pakistan promotes terrorism, but the car which was tied to explosives in Malegaon was of Sadhvi Pragya Singh
 is visphot main das log maare gaye the or ek sau se adhik ghayal hue the
 After getting the ticket, it should be clear why the Prime Minister liked Sadhvi Pragya Thakur and what does it mean to the Prime Minister
 ovaisi ne kaha ki agar ham kisi bam visphot ke aaropee ke saath photo bhi khinchvaa lete to media do din use sir par uthaae rakhata
 Sadhvi says election is a crusade and if Owaisi had said the same thing, the media would have created a ruckus

 What Sadhvi Pragya had said BJP candidate from Bhophal, Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, had said, 'he was a member of the Investigating Officer Security Commission, he called Hemant Karkare and told him to release Sadhvi
 lekin hemanth karkare ne kaha ki main kuch bhi karuunga lekin saboot laaunga or sadhvi ko nahin chhoduunga
 This was his wretchedness, this was treason, he was unprincipled, he used to ask me if i had to go to God for the truth, then i said that you need to go
 maine use kaha tha tera sarvanaash hoga, usne mujhe gaaliyaan di thim
 On the day i went, there was a thread on her and when she was killed by the terrorists, the thread ended
 'haalanki, aalochana hone ke baad sadhvi ne apana bayaan waapas lete hue kaha tha, 'agar kisi ne hamen pratadit kiya to hamane usko kah diya he
 This should be our statement of course
 lekin hamaare desh ke dushmano ko is se bal miltaa he

 So in the national capital, a huge march is being organized against the implementation of 13 point roster for the appointment of teachers in the country's universities

 Tejashwi's march to Parliament till the appointment of teachers in the universities of the country for the reservation of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes against the implementation of the 13 Point Roster Rule, the leader of Rashtriya Janata Dal and Leader of Bihar, Tejashwi Yadav Has called for a march from Mandi House to Parliament
 tejasvi ne is babat pradhanmantri narendra modi ko khulaa patr likhakar kaha he ki aarakshan ko khatm karne ke liye sajishan vishvavidhyalayon main 13 point roster kii niyam lagu kiya ja rahaa he, taaki saamaajik rup se pichde varg ko aarakshan kaa laabh na mil paae
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 aage or ladaai heisse pehle jab centre sarkaar dwaara saamaanya varg ke garibon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak paas karaayaa gaya, tab bhi argedy ne is bill kaa khulkar virodh kiya tha
 RJD described it as the first step in the conspiracy to end reservation
 argedy netaa or saansad manoj jha ne 'ajtak' se baatcheet main kaha ki 13 point roster is andolan kaa taatkaalik kaaran he
 But the big fight is to provide socially exploited section of the population in terms of population
 hamaare or anya bahujan netaa sau dfa kah chuke hai ki aarakshan khayraat nahin balki dalit-bahujan samaaj ke pratinidhitiv ko sunishchit karne kaa ek jariya he
 He said that the government kept sleeping till the agitation of April 2, 2018 on the Supreme Court's decision to blunt the SC / ST Act
 ram mandir mudda garmayayah sab kuch tab ho rahaa he jab desh loksabhaa chunaav ke muhane par khadaa he
 On one hand, the central government has taken a big step in the Ram temple construction case before the election and has played its bet by asking the Supreme Court to return the non-disputed land
 to vahiin prayagraj main dharmasansad main mandir nirmaan kii taarikh kaa elaan ho gaya he
 Apart from this, a two-day Dharmasand is going to be held from Thursday under the leadership of VHP

 The beginning of Mandal vs Kamandal, both of these events are reminiscent of the 90s when former Prime Minister VP Singh, who headed the National Front government, decided to implement the Mandal Commission recommendation
 us dauraan veepi singh kii sarkaar bijepi or vam dalon kii baisakhi par khadi thi
 This decision of his made the BJP nervous
 jatiyon kii jatilta ko samajhate hue bijepi ne is par koi tatkaal pratikriya nahin di
 But to cut the far-reaching political outcome of the Mandal Commission recommendation, senior BJP leader LK Advani intensified the Ram Mandir movement, shouting Hindu solidarity
 baad main raajnneeti kii in do dhaaraon ke takaraav ko mandal banaam kamandal kaa naam diya gaya
 In which there were Hinduist organizations on the one hand, on the other hand, organizations that followed the principle of gandhi-ambedkar-lohia
 somnath se chalakar adwani kii rathyatra jab bihar pahunchi to lalu yadav kii sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya
 Due to this action of Janata Dal leader Lalu Yadav, BJP withdrew support from VP Singh's government
 jiske baad veepi singh ne kaha ki saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai main sampradayikta ke khilaaf unhone apni gaddi qurbaan kar di
 Will Mandal vs Kamandal be Lok Sabha 2019? Now with only a few months left in the Lok Sabha elections, the Ram temple issue is once again hot
 centre sarkaar ke kadam se bijepi ko bhi bal mila he, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad ke kaaryakarta utsahit hai
 Therefore, in this election, the issue of Ram temple will be strongly emphasized
 vahiin, saamaanya varg ko aarakshan, 13 point roster ko mudda banaakar ek baar phir saamaajik nyaay ke naam par golbandi kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 In the coming time, both these streams have full scope of collision
 lihaaja, loksabhaa chunaav se pehle ek baar phir mandal banaam kamandal kii prishthbhumi taiyaar hoti dikh rahi he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh compared the recent meetings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to the deliberations taking place inside a 'think tank'

 He said, be it the economy, education, culture, national security and social harmony, we discussed all the issues related to the country
 yah ek vichaar manch (think tanks) tha, jisamen sabhi muddon par charchaa kii gai
 The minister rejected the idea that the union had reviewed the 15-month functioning of the NDA government
 tippaniyan He said, there was no evaluation of the government
 achche yaa bure (sarkaar ke pradarshan) ko lekar koi charchaa nahin kii gai
 The Home Minister stressed that the RSS never gives instructions but only gives suggestions and there is nothing wrong in discussing any suggestion
 rajnath ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kii tarah vah khud bhi aresas ke swayamsevak hai or kisi ko bhi isse koi dikkat nahin honi chahie
 The opposition's allegation that the Modi government is running the RSS, he said, there is no truth in it

 The comments unhone kaha, sarkaar kaa koi moolyankan nahin kiya gaya
 There was no discussion of good or bad (government performance)
 grih mantri ne jor dete hue kaha ki aresas kabhi nirdesh nahin detaa, balki keval suzav detaa he or kisi suzav par charchaa karne main kuch bhi galat nahin he
 Rajnath said that like the Prime Minister, he himself is an RSS volunteer and no one should have any problem with this
 vipaksh ke aarope ki modi sarkaar ko aresas chalaa rahi he, unhone kaha, isamen koi sachai nahin he

 janata dal you ke rajyasabha sadsy sharad yadav ne kaha ki yah janadesh ke khilaaf he or asli janata dal you hamaare paas he
 In the midst of all this, the leaders of the Janata Dal u have a tremendous urge to answer

 Many Congress mlas are not getting support from RJD
 chaahe wo vichaardhaara kaa maamla ho yaa kshetra main voton kaa hisaab kitaab
 The 27 Congress mlas won in 2015 with the support of the Grand Alliance
 pichley 20 varshon main isse zyada seat congress ko kabhi nahin mili thi
 The Congress also got a chance to run the government in the state, but the government lost its hand due to the Central leadership not having a clear decision on Tejashwi Yadav
 20 maheenon tak satta kaa swaad chakh chuke congressiyon ko ye raas nahin aa rahaa he

 But, this is not enough to revive the party
 congress ke vidhayakon ko aage koi rasta najar nahin aa rahaa he

 After being declared bjp's CM candidate, Kiran Bedi was greeted by Aam Aadmi Party chief and CM candidate Arvind Kejriwal and openly challenged the debate
 arvind kejariwal ne twit kar aaj kaha ki kiran bedi ko bijepi kaa siem pad kaa ummidavaar banane par badhai or kaha ki saarvajanik manch par vah unhen khuli bahes ke liye aamantrit karte hai
 They say that this debate should be conducted by an impartial person and all channels should show it
 ek anya twit main kejariwal ne kaha ki kiran bedi ji main aapako twitor par follow karata hum, lekin aapane ab mujhe block kar diya he, kripaya an-block kar den
 The answer has come from Kiran Bedi
 unhone kaha ki jab kejariwal ne khud ko arajak kaha tha tab se hi unhone unhon block kar diya tha
 He has now come to mind
 aap party ke anya netaa kumaar vishwaas ne kiran bedi ke ek puraane twit ko phir aaj jari karte hue kaha he ki aapako aisi hi ek bhartiya bahes tak sweekaar nahin? aap to kahati thim 'ai daire' 
 Let me tell you that Vishwas has exposed Kiran Bedi's tweet in which Kiran Bedi has written to look into the debate between Obama and Romney
 bahes ke liye kejariwal kii kiran bedi ko chunauti ke bich congress party ke dilli ke chunaav prabharee ajay maakan ne twit kar is bahes ko swikaarne kii baat kahi he, lekin unka kahana he ki yah bahes santulit (strecchard) honi chahie
 On the other hand, while talking to NDTV in a road show organized during the filing of his nomination, Arvind Kejriwal said that the debate should be done before the election
 janata ko pataa chalanaa chahie ki vah kisi mudde par kya sochati hai
 It is noteworthy that BJP has made Kiran Bedi the chief ministerial candidate for the Delhi Assembly elections
 somvaar ko bijepi sansadeey board kii baithak main is baat kaa faisla liya gaya he
 Announcing the decision, BJP president Amit Shah said that Kiran Bedi will contest from Krishna Nagar seat in Delhi and BJP workers will work twice as vigorously as her candidature is announced

 bihar main bhale mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar 20 maheene rahi, lekin iske do ghatak janata dal united or rajd ke sheersh netaa nitish kumaar or lalu yadav ke rishte kabhi sahaj nahin rahe
 It is not hidden from anyone that the relationship between the two was not comfortable
 somvaar ko nitish kumaar ne patrakaron se baatcheet main kaha ki unke vidhayakon ko todane kii koshish se bhi lalu yadav baj nahin aae
 Nitish said that Lalu was not deterring his party from luring the mlas to the party 15 days before the break-up
 padhein:29 saal main 11 baar tut chukaa he janata parivaar, kya sharad yadav 12veen baar karenge khandit? Nitish asked that at that time would he drown his party for the grand alliance? Although the RJD has not responded to this allegation, the discussion was very hot in the political corridor of Patna
 khud rajd ke raajnneetijna is baat ko lekar aashwast the ki lalu yadav apane prabhaav se janata dal united ko vibhajit kar denge
 The RJD leader believes that Nitish had no choice but to chew the nails after the cleverly executed game of power conversion
 tippaniyan Read: The heat of the creation scam reached Rabri Devi's tenure, even before the attackers were Nitish Kumar, in his party's program, for the first time, Nitish Kumar said that he used to announce from the public platform like Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi that he made the Chief Minister or the same To remain Chief Minister was quite humiliating for him
 haalanki rajd netaa yah bhi maanate hai ki nitish ne kai baar lalu yadav ke najdiki logon ke saamne apni naaraazgi jaahir kii thi, lekin lalu yadav ne shaayad is baat kaa akalan nahin kiya ki nitish bhaajapa ke saath kuch ghanton main sarkaar kaa gathan kar lenge

 Read: Janata family has broken 11 times in 29 years, will Sharad Yadav disband for the 12th time? nitish ne kaha ki us samay apni party ko mahagathbandhan ke liye dubo dete kya? haalanki rajd ne is aarope par koi pratikriya nahin di he, lekin patna ke raajnneetik galiyare main is baat kii charchaa bahut garam thi
 RJD politicians themselves were convinced that Lalu Yadav would divide Janata Dal United with his influence
 rajd ke netaa maanate hai ki nitish ne satta parivartan ke khel ko jis chaturaai se anjaam diya uske baad nakhun chabane ke alaava koi vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 The comments padhein: srijan ghotaale kii aanch rabari devi ke kaarykaal tak pahunchi, nitish kumaar hue hamalavar iske pehle bhi apni party ke kaarykram main nitish kumaar ne pehali baar kaha ki lalu yadav or tejasvi jaise saarvajanik manch se yah elaan karte the ki mukhyamantri unhone banaaya yaa vahi mukhyamantri bane rahenge unke liye kaaphi apmanjanak tha
 Although the RJD leader also believes that Nitish had expressed his displeasure to the people close to Lalu Yadav several times, Lalu Yadav probably did not assess that Nitish would form the government with the BJP in a few hours

 Shahabuddin's statement that Nitish is the leader of the situation but Lalu was also very angry at Yadav's silence, but recently Lalu Yadav said in a meeting at Siwan Yatra that Shahabuddin had rightly said

 bijepi bahanebaazi karke apane kaam ko taal rahi he
 However, the Aam Aadmi Party will not let the bjp's plan succeed

 Here are some special timepass games
 
 
 1
 Antakshari: This popular childhood game got recognition on the screen from Rajshree Films

 Let us know that in these assembly elections, BJP had fielded candidates for a total of 384 seats
 11 siton par apana dal or 8 siton par esbspi ne apane ummidavaar utaare the
 Speaking of vote share, BJP got a total of 39
 7% vot mili
 1 to Apna Dal among its allies
 0% or suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ko 0
 Got 7% votes

 29 percent of the votes were cast

 The impact of the alliance is more visible on the decrease of 49 percent
 gauratlab he ki 114 siton par chunaav ladane ke baad bhi congress ko sirf 6
 Got 2 percent votes
 loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi tha aisa hi haal2014 main loksabhaa chunaavon ke vakt chali modi lahar main bhi bijepi kaa karnama kuch aisa hi tha
 Out of the total 80 assembly seats in the state, BJP won 71 and its ally Apna Dal won 2 seats
