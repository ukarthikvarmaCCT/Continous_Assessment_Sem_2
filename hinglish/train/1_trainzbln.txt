 telecom regulatory atholity of india (TRAI) kaa nayaa niyam farvari se lagu hoga
 Broadcasters were asked to implement the new rule from December 29, but it was postponed
 TRAI ne bharat ke sabhi dit or cabel operators ko aadesh diya he ki wo nae niyam ko pholo karen
 Under the new regulation, customers will only pay for the channels they have to watch
 isse pehle tak aisa nahin tha
 TV subscription methods will change after the new rule
 ab aapako free tu air channels ke liye paise dene honge, lekin iske alaava aapako duusare sabhi channels ke liye paise nahin dene honge
 Earlier, the operators used to give such packages in which there were hundreds of channels and money was taken for all these
 lekin farvari kii shuruyaat se aap jin channels ko dekhnaa chahenge unke liye hi paise dene honge
 Although operators will still sell channels packages, it will be customized according to you
 tri ke nae niyam ke baad customers par koi bhi channel thopa nahin jayega
 The cost of subscription of each channel will be shown on the TV screen and you can subscribe to it by calling Customer Care or visiting the website of that broadcaster
 tri ke mutabik customers ke paas100 standard definishnake channels chunane kii aazaadee hogi
 They can customize it in their own way
 isamen aap chahen to free channel rakhen yaa phir ped channel
 You will have to pay separately for paid channels, while you will have to pay a fixed amount for free channels
 tri ne kaha he ki is pack kii maximum price 130 rupee hogi
 Service tax separately
 yani aap agar 130 rupee (sarvice tex alag) denge to aapako 100 channels die jaaenge
 These 100 channels can be free or paid channels
 yah puri tarah se customers par depend karata he ki wo in 100 channels main se koun se free rakhega yaa koun se ped rakhega
 For users who want more than 100 channels, the option is that they will have to pay Rs 20 extra for 25 channel capacity
 yani aapako 125 channel capacity chahie to aapako 130+20 rupee dene honge
 Then how much will you keep free channels or will keep paid channels according to your wish
 ise aasaan shabdon main aise samajhen, channel capacity ko bhi samajhen
 
 130 rupee main aapako 100 channel capacity milegi
 You can think of it as a space, that you paid 130 rupees and you got 100 channels of space
 aap isamen chahen to 90 free channel rakh len or 10 ped channel
 Obviously you will not have to pay for the free channel, but you will have to pay for the paid channel
 ye channel pe depend karata he wo kitne kaa he
 In this way, the subscription charge of those channels will be added to your bill in addition to 130 rupees
 total bill par 18% jiesti lagegaa or aapkaa bill taiyaar hoga

 On this occasion, Chinese crackers and other products worth crores of rupees are sold in Gujarat every year
 gharon ko roshni karne vaali chyanij liton kaa bhi bolbalaa rahata he
 But this year, all-round Chinese things are being opposed in the country
 gujarat chembers of commers and industries ne to unase jude vyapaariyon ko aadesh diya he ki ve is saamaan kaa bahishkaar karen
 Chamber President Bipin Patel says that China is not supporting India properly against terrorism, so they will boycott Chinese goods in protest against it
 duusari ore gujarat ke pataakhaa bazaar main chyanij pataakhon kii bikri main kami najar aa rahi he
 People of Gujarat also want to keep themselves away from Chinese firecrackers and electronics items
 jaahir he china nirmit chizon ke prati bad rahe is aakrosh kaa khamiyaja sthaneey vyapaariyon ko uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 The comments ek vyapaaree ne kaha ki sarkaar ko chines pataakhon par pratibandh lagane kaa faisla farvari-march tak le lenaa chahie tha taaki koi vyapaaree yah saamaan nahin kharidta
 Now, on a large scale, traders have bought sugar crackers and other products, then naturally they will sell it

 But this stuff is not visible in areas like satellite, Jajis Bungalow Road
 kuch vyapaaree iske samarthan main hai to kai vyapaaree is faisle se khaase naaraaz hai
 The annual merchandise of Chinese goods in Gujarat is about 20,000 crores
 chembar ke adhyaksh bipin patel kaa kahana he ki aatankwaad ke khilaaf china bharat ko thik se samarthan nahin de rahaa he, isliye iske virodh main ve china ke saamaan kaa bahishkaar karenge
 On the other hand, there is a decrease in the sale of Chinese firecrackers in Gujarat's firecracker market
 gujarat ke log bhi is baar chyanij pataakhon or electronics saamagree se khud ko dur rakhana chaahate hai
 Obviously, local businessmen have to bear the brunt of this growing anger towards China made goods
 tippaniyan One businessman said that the government should have taken the decision to ban Chinese firecrackers by february-march so that no merchant would buy this item
 ab bade paimaane par vyapaariyon ne chini pataakhe or anya utpaada kharid liye hai to swaabhaavik taur par ve use bechenge hi
 In Ahmedabad, Chinese goods are sold in Kalupur, Delhi Darwaja, Raipur, Kubera Nagar, etc

 Some traders are in support of this and many traders are angry with this decision

 The BBC reported that Mullah Omar had been killed, so it made headlines in all the media
 afgaan sarkaar ke sutron ke hawaale se ye bhi likhaa gaya ki uski maut do-teen saal pehle hi ho chuki he
 Further information was not provided further, saying that the government source has not given any more details
 is khabar ke thodi der baad afghanistan ke raashtrapati ke up pravaktaa syed jafar hashmi ne twit ke jariye media ko press conference ke liye bulaayaa
 Then came a statement from the Afghan government that after seeing the news of Mullah Omar being killed in the media, she was investigating whether Mullah Omar had actually died
 phir afgani khufia agency ke hawaale se maut kii khabar ko sahi bhi bataa diya gaya
 Now the question arises that if this news came from the 'sutra' of the government of Afghanistan, why did the government not provide evidence in its favor
 or yah bhi ki yadi bibisi ne ise braking news kii tarah chalaaya to vah kuch or byora kyon nahin de paaya? It is not the first time that the news of Mullah Omar's death has come
 pehle bhi kai baar aisa ho chukaa he, lekin kabhi jaanch nahin hui
 The Taliban has been denying it in its own way
 yahaan tak ki taliban ne haal hi main id ke maukey par bhi mullah umr ke naam se badhai sandesh jari kiya tha
 This time, till this news is written, the Taliban has not reacted to the news of Mullah Omar's death
 mullah umr ke jinda rahane ke jitne daawey hai, utane hi ishaare uske jivit nahin hone ke bhi hai
 a former Afghan Taliban minister told a Pakistani newspaper that Mullah Omar died of TB in 2013
 yah bhi kaha gaya ki use afghanistan kii jameen par hi dafnaaya gaya unhone or unke bete ne uske shav kii pahchaan bhi kii
 Apart from this, according to Qari Hamza, a spokesman for the Afghan Islamic Movement Fidayeen, a group that broke away from the Taliban, Mullah Omar had fallen victim to the bullets of Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansoor and Gul Agha in July 2013 itself
 hamaja ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki unke paas is baat ke saboot hai, lekin afgaan sarkaar yaa pashchimi media ne use mahatv nahin diya
 Questions have also been raised about where Mullah Omar is
 america sahit kai anya khufia agenciyaan maanati hai ki wo paak afgaan seemaa ke aasapaas kahin chipa he jabaki kuch kaa maananaa he ki osama bin laden kii tarah vah bhi pakistan main sharan liye hue he
 After Mulla Baradar's arrest in Pakistan, the Andeshe received further air that he was in a safe place near Quetta or Karachi, but nothing was ever said with confidence about his whereabouts
 vah bhi tab jab umr ke sir par 10 billian america dollar kaa inaam bhi america ne ghoshit kiya hua he
 This time a very interesting thing is also about the timing of the news of Mullah Omar being killed
 kaha ja rahaa he ki taliban main nae mukhiya ke chunaav ko lekar buudhvaar ko hi ek baithak hui he
 In this, there was a discussion about the appointment of Mullah Baradar, one of the two assistants appointed by Mullah Omar
 baradar ko pakistan main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or baad main use kai anya talibani kaidiyon ke saath is daleel ke saath reeha kar diya gaya tha ki isse taliban or afgaan sarkaar ke bich shanti vaarta shuru karne main madad milegi
 In such a situation, the question arises that if Mullah Omar is alive then why the question of election of the new chief
 yaa phir kahin aisa to nahin ki is 'khabar' ke jariye taliban par manovaigyanik dabaav banane ke liye aisa kiya ja rahaa he taaki uske 'sauda karne kii takat' ko kam kiya ja sake? a second round of peace talks is to be held later this week between the Afghan High Peace Council and Taliban representatives, which is being held with the help of Pakistan
 is baatcheet kaa makasad afghanistan main chaudaa saal se chal rahi ladaai ko khatm karne ke liye rasta talashna he
 There is some suspense regarding the date and place of the second round of talks but this is sure to happen
 kuch sutara bataate hai ki duusare daur kii baatcheet 30-31 july ko pakistan main hi hogi or vah bhi hill stesan mari main jahaan pehle daur kii shanti vaarta hui thi
 It was decided that we would meet again
 kuch aisi bhi report aa rahi thi ki duusare daur kii vaarta china ke uttari pashchimi shahar urumki main hogi, haalanki isaki pushti nahin ho pai
 This news also got wind because the first round of talks were attended by observers from China and America
 yah bhi jaankaree ai ki taliban doha main baatcheet chahta he
 The comments saat july ko pehle daur kii baatcheet kii jagah ko gupt rakhaa gaya tha, lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki yah islamabad ke najadik ke hill stesan mari main hi hui thi
 In this conversation, the Taliban mainly gave in to their many demands
 isamen yuan main taliban se pratibandh hataanaa taaki iske sadsy antarrashtriya yatraaen bina kisi rukaawat ke kar saken, taliban ko apana ek karyaalay kholane kii anumati dena, taaki vah khud ko ek raajnneetik party ke taur par khud ko sthapit kar sake
 The Afghan government wants the Taliban to fully agree to a ceasefire first
 baatcheet kii aupchaarik mej tak pahunchane ke pehle afgaan or taliban ke pratinidhiyon ke bich kai anaupchaarik daur kii baatcheet hui
 It is a different matter that questions have also arisen that if peace talks with Taliban have reached any conclusion, then all the factions of the terrorists who are active in Afghanistan will accept it
 lekin mullah umr kii maut par sarkari saboot pesh kiye jane tak or taliban ke ise maan liye jane tak ye sawaal bana rahegaa ki aakhir abhi is khabar ko 'chalaane' ke peeche kahin koi antarrashtriya kootneeti to nahin? Shortly after this news, Syed Zafar Hashmi, deputy spokesman for the President of Afghanistan, called the media for a press conference via tweet
 phir afgaan sarkaar kii ore se yah bayaan aayaa ki media main mullah umr ke maare jane kii khabar dekhne ke baad vah is baat kii jaanch kar rahi he ki kya mullah umr kii sachmuch main maut ho chuki he
 Then the news of the death was also corrected by quoting Afghan intelligence agency
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki yadi yah khabar afghanistan sarkaar ke 'sutara' ke hawaale se ai, to sarkaar ne iske paksh main saboot kyon nahin pesh kiye
 And also, if the BBC ran it like breaking news, why couldn't it provide some more details? aisa nahin he ki mullah umr ke maut kii khabar pehali baar ai ho
 This has happened many times before, but never investigated
 taliban apni tarah se ise nakaarta rahaa he
 Even the Taliban recently issued a congratulatory message in the name of Mullah Omar on the occasion of Eid
 is baar to yah khabar likhe jane tak taliban ne apni taraf se mullah umr kii maut kii khabar par koi pratikriya nahin di he
 As many claims of Mullah Omar to be alive, the same gestures are for his not being alive
 purv afgaan taliban ke ek mantri ne pakistan ke ek akhbaar ko bataaya tha ki mullah umr kii 2013 main tibi se maut ho chuki he
 It was also said that he was buried on the land of Afghanistan and he and his son also identified his body
 isse alag, taliban se tuutakar alag hue ek group afghanistan islamic movement fidaayin mahaj ke pravaktaa kaari hamaja ke anusaar mullah umr july 2013 main hi mullah akhtar mohammad mansoor or gul aagaa kii goliyon kaa shikaar ho gaya tha
 Hamza also claimed that he had evidence to this effect, but the Afghan government or Western media did not value him
 mullah umr kahaan he is baat ko lekar bhi sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Many other intelligence agencies, including the US, believe that he is hiding somewhere around the pak-afghan border, while some believe he, like Osama bin Laden, has taken refuge in Pakistan
 mullah baradar kii pakistan main giraftaar ke baad is andeshe ko or hawa mili ki vah queta yaa karachi ke paas surakshit jagah par he, lekin uske thikaane ko lekar bharose ke saath kabhi kuch kaha nahin gaya
 That too when the US has also announced a bounty of US $ 10 billion on Omar's head
 is baar ek badi dilachasp baat mullah umr ke maare jane kii khabar kii timming ko lekar bhi he
 It is being said that a meeting has been held on Wednesday for the election of the new chief in the Taliban
 isamen mullah umr kii ore se hi niyukt do sahaayakon main se ek mullah baradar ko mukhiya banaae jane ko lekar charchaa hui
 Baradar was arrested in Pakistan and later released along with several other Taliban prisoners on the plea that it would help in starting peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government
 aise main sawaal uthanaa swaabhaavik he ki yadi mullah umr jinda he to nae mukhiya ke chunaav kaa sawaal kyon
 Or is it that this 'news' is being done to create psychological pressure on the Taliban to reduce its 'bargaining power'? is saptaah ke ant main afgaan hai pis council or taliban ke pratinidhiyon ke bich duusare daur kii shanti vaarta honi he jo pakistan kii madad se ho rahi he
 The purpose of this conversation is to find a way to end the fourteen years of fighting in Afghanistan
 duusare daur kii baatcheet kii taarikh or jagah ko lekar thodaa suspence he lekin iskaa hona tay he
 Some sources suggest that the second round of talks will take place in Pakistan on 30â€“31 July and that too in Hill Station Mary where the first round of peace talks took place
 isamen yah tay hua tha ki phir milenge
 There were reports that the second round of talks would be held in China's northwestern city of Urumqi, although this could not be confirmed
 is khabar ko isliye bhi hawa mili, kyonki pehle daur kii baatcheet main china or america ke paryvekshak bhi shaamil hue the
 It was also learned that the Taliban wants talks in Doha
 tippaniyan On July 7, the site of the first round of talks was kept secret, but it was later learned that it had taken place at the nearby hill station Mari, Islamabad
 is baatcheet main mukhya taur par taliban ne apni kai maangon par jo diya
 This included lifting the ban on the Taliban in the U
N
 so that its members could undertake international travel without interruption, allowing the Taliban to open an office of their own to establish themselves as a political party
 afgaan sarkaar chaahati he ki pehle taliban puri tarah se yudhviram ko raji ho
 There were several informal rounds of talks between Afghan and Taliban representatives before reaching the formal table of talks
 ye alag baat he ki sawaal is par bhi uthte rahe hai ki agar taliban ke saath shanti vaarta kisi nattejey par pahunch hi gai to kya afghaanist main sacriye aatankwaadiyon ke tamaam dhade ise maanenge
 But until the official evidence on Mullah Omar's death is presented and the Taliban accept it, the question will remain whether there is any international diplomacy behind this news 'running'? aisa nahin he ki mullah umr ke maut kii khabar pehali baar ai ho
 This has happened many times before, but never investigated
 taliban apni tarah se ise nakaarta rahaa he
 Even the Taliban recently issued a congratulatory message in the name of Mullah Omar on the occasion of Eid

 lekin mullah umr kii maut par sarkari saboot pesh kiye jane tak or taliban ke ise maan liye jane tak ye sawaal bana rahegaa ki aakhir abhi is khabar ko 'chalaane' ke peeche kahin koi antarrashtriya kootneeti to nahin? This time a very interesting thing is also about the timing of the news of Mullah Omar being killed
 kaha ja rahaa he ki taliban main nae mukhiya ke chunaav ko lekar buudhvaar ko hi ek baithak hui he
 In this, there was a discussion about the appointment of Mullah Baradar, one of the two assistants appointed by Mullah Omar
 baradar ko pakistan main giraftaar kiya gaya tha or baad main use kai anya talibani kaidiyon ke saath is daleel ke saath reeha kar diya gaya tha ki isse taliban or afgaan sarkaar ke bich shanti vaarta shuru karne main madad milegi
 In such a situation, the question arises that if Mullah Omar is alive then why the question of election of the new chief
 yaa phir kahin aisa to nahin ki is 'khabar' ke jariye taliban par manovaigyanik dabaav banane ke liye aisa kiya ja rahaa he taaki uske 'sauda karne kii takat' ko kam kiya ja sake? a second round of peace talks is to be held later this week between the Afghan High Peace Council and Taliban representatives, which is being held with the help of Pakistan

Some sources suggest that the second round of talks will take place in Pakistan on 30â€“31 July and that too in Hill Station Mary where the first round of peace talks took place
 isamen yah tay hua tha ki phir milenge
 There were reports that the second round of talks would be held in China's northwestern city of Urumqi, although this could not be confirmed
 is khabar ko isliye bhi hawa mili, kyonki pehle daur kii baatcheet main china or america ke paryvekshak bhi shaamil hue the
 It was also learned that the Taliban wants talks in Doha
 tippaniyan On July 7, the site of the first round of talks was kept secret, but it was later learned that it had taken place at the nearby hill station Mari, Islamabad
 is baatcheet main mukhya taur par taliban ne apni kai maangon par jo diya
 This included lifting the ban on the Taliban in the U
N
 so that its members could undertake international travel without interruption, allowing the Taliban to open an office of their own to establish themselves as a political party
 afgaan sarkaar chaahati he ki pehle taliban puri tarah se yudhviram ko raji ho
 There were several informal rounds of talks between Afghan and Taliban representatives before reaching the formal table of talks
 ye alag baat he ki sawaal is par bhi uthte rahe hai ki agar taliban ke saath shanti vaarta kisi nattejey par pahunch hi gai to kya afghaanist main sacriye aatankwaadiyon ke tamaam dhade ise maanenge
 But until the official evidence on Mullah Omar's death is presented and the Taliban accept it, the question will remain whether there is any international diplomacy behind this news 'running'? saat july ko pehle daur kii baatcheet kii jagah ko gupt rakhaa gaya tha, lekin baad main pataa chalaa ki yah islamabad ke najadik ke hill stesan mari main hi hui thi

 But until the official evidence on Mullah Omar's death is presented and the Taliban accept it, the question will remain whether there is any international diplomacy behind this news 'running'? bhartiya janata party ke jivan ke ek mahatvapurn adhyay kaa ant ho gaya he
 Lal Krishna Advani and his colleague Murali Manohar Joshi, who played a key role in energizing the party with Hinduism slogans, are no longer in the parliamentary committee
 donon hi netaa 1980 ke baad se party main mahatvapurn padon par rahe or unki baat suni jaati rahi
 Advani devised several strategies to bring the party to power and if the party came to power in 1998, its credit also went to Advani
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke shasankaal main to vah party ke duusare sabase bade netaa the
 With his rath yatra and Shila Yatra, he took the party to every village
 joshi ne party ko vaicharik str par majboot kiya
 Both along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee established the Bharatiya Janata Party in Indian politics
 vaajapeyi ab biimaar rahete hai or vah sakriy bhi nahin he
 With this, the curtain has fallen on the activities of this powerful trio in the country's politics
 narendra modi ke naam par party kii loksabhaa chunaav main abhootpurv safalataa ke baad yah lagbhag tay ho gaya tha ki party ke bujurg netaaon ke liye aane vaala samay baari padegaa
 It is known that Advani pushed Modi forward but when he felt that he was going too far, he adopted a negative policy
 modi ko rokane, unke raste main avrodh daalane or in sabase badhkar unka khulaa virodh karne main unhone koi kasar nahin chhodi
 Murali Manohar Joshi too did not hesitate to leave Varanasi seat
 ve to modi ke liye prachaar karne tak nahin gaye
 Actually, both these big leaders failed to read the writings written on the wall
 badhati umr ne unki ankhon ke saamne pardaa daal diya tha or ve modi kii khilaafat hi karte rah gaye
 This did not go in his favor and obviously Modi's policy of opposition proved costly for him
 party ko bujurgon se chhutakaara dilaane or yuvaaon ko laane kii niti ke tahat modi ne nae netaaon ko mauka diya
 In this top committee of the party, he has tried new people and done everything according to his thinking
 nai sansadeey samiti puri tarah se modi kii pasand ke netaaon se bani he or jaahir he ki unke disha nirdesh par chalegi
 Modi does not want to have any opposition in the 'house' or he cannot take the decision according to his wish
 ab modi ne party main puri tarah se apni pakad bana lee he
 Look in which direction they take him
 party main unki baat par muhar laga karegi or faisle bhi unki marji ke mutabik honge
 For older and older leaders, a committee has been formed in the party
 adwani or joshi sareekhe netaa vahaan baithkar party kii gatividhiyaan or uski disha dekh sakenge lekin kuch kar nahin paaenge

 dinanagar thane ke tahat avaanka gaanv nivasee ravindar kumaar ne aarope lagaate hue bataaya ki vah apane dost munish kumaar ke saath dhabas par khaanaa kha rahaa tha, tabhi chaar yuvakon kaa ek samooh vahaan pahunchaa
 And they started beating Munish and put him in his car and took him to an unknown place
 iske baad aropiyon ne use peet-petakarmautake ghat utaar diya or uske shav ko singhowal gaanv main phenk diya
 From where the police recovered his body late on Friday night
 shav ko postmortem ke liye bhej diya gaya he
 a local police officer said that under various sections of the IPC, a case has been registered against Kuldeep Singh Gandhi, Davinder Singh alias Chhotu, Yoda and Bikka
 ab aropiyon kii talash kii ja rahi he
 On the other hand, the local people protested and blocked the main road of the area against the alleged inaction of the police regarding this murder
 yahi nahin gussaye logon ne kareeb paanch ghante tak dinanagar thane kaa gheraav kiya
 They calmed down after the authorities explained
 kendriya mantri smriti irani ne vipakshi ekta par jamkar prahaar kiya he
 He also attacked the Mamata Banerjee government over the murder of a BJP worker in Bengal
 smriti ne gujarat ke ahmedabad main shanivaar ko kaha ki agar ranneeti bani he to uski saarvajanik charchaa nahin hogi, lekin ye bhi kahana uchit hoga ki vipakshi partiyon ko apana vajood bachaae rakhane ke liye jaddojahad kerani pad rahi he or ek hona pad rahaa he
 He said, 'for the people of India, the Opposition is also indicating that they no longer have the power to win the heart of India on the strength of their ideology, policy or leadership alone
 to kahin na kahin vipaksh kaa ek hona modi kii popularity kaa sabase bada sanket or udhaaharan he
 It is also a sign that the opposition does not have the strength to fight alone
 'bengal main bijepi kaaryakarta kii hatya par smriti ne kaha ki rajya sarkarnirmam hatyaonpar chuppi saadhe baithi he
 No one has said anything till now
 sirf bhaajapa ke kaaryakartaaon kii ore se aakrosh vyakt ho rahaa he
 He said, 'today i want to tell every citizen of the country to look at the condition of Bengal that there is no attempt to strangle democracy in elections only, but how BJP workers are being targeted and killed is
 'unhone aage kaha, 'ye hatyaein maatr isliye ho rahi hai kyonki wo vikaas kii gaatha ko aage badhaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 So because they want to put the country first
 unka dosha sirf ye he ki wo rashtrawaad ke hit main hai
 Their only fault is that they are Bharatiya Janata Party workers
 'smriti irani ne kaha ki aajammata banerjee sarkatiogar rajya kii janata ko behatar kanoon-vyavastha dene main, nishaanaa banaakar kii ja rahi hatyaon main peedit parivaar ko nyaay dene main vifal he to ye na sirf bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ke aakrosh kaa vishay he balki puure desh ke liye ek chintan kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 Issues may not be getting place, but according to the victory and defeat, municipal elections have started gaining a lot of importance in the media
 bijepi ne panchayat, zila parishad, nagar palika or nagar nigam chunaavon ko raajnneetik rup se mahatvapurn bana diya he
 The BJP has done the political search or rediscover of these elections
 bijepi puri takat jhonk detii he, rashtriya adhyaksh se lekar saansad mantri tak in chunaavon main prachaar karte hai
 Through this, the BJP maintains the political ambition of a large number of its workers
 kaaryakartaaon ko bhi lagata he ki parshad ban jaao, kal vidhayak bhi ban jaaenge
 In this way, the BJP has found a very good way to absorb or keep active the army of workers
 is ranneeti ne bijepi ko ardhsainik bal kii tarah bana diya he, jiskaa trek kisi nae lokation par jane ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahata he
 The form of MCD election coverage that you saw in the media is due to BJP
 chand hindi or angrezi akhbaar hi nagarpalika kii khabaren niyamit rup se cover karte hai
 In the channels, there will be reporters who know the MCD
 iske baad bhi pehali baar news channelon ne emsidi ke chunaav or nateezon ko loksabhaa kii tarah cover kiya he
 Remember when the election of MCD with less than 800 crore budget got so much space on the channels
 emsidi ke is chunaav se pehle media main brihan mumbai nagarpalika ke chunaav ko hi mahatv diya jaataa tha
 Due to budget of 30-40 thousand crores and control of Shiv Sena
 biemasi par niyantran ke zariye wo hindustan kii ekmaatr party he jo rashtriya str par apana mahatv banaae rakhti he
 Many parties still do not give importance to body elections
 bijepi ne nikaay chunaavon ko hai profile bana diya he
 Which was also supposed to happen
 emsidi ke chunaavon main bijepi 2007, 2012 ke baad lagaataar teesri baar jiti he
 The Congress has fallen by less than half compared to 2012
 30 ward main hi jeet mili
 The Aam Aadmi Party, contesting for the first time, has won 48 wards
 bijepi ko 181 ward main jeet mili he
 BJP has been victorious in 64 wards out of 104 of the Northern MCD
 dakshini emsidi ke 104 main se 70 ward main bijepi jiti he
 BJP won 48 of the 64 wards of the Eastern MCD
 teen nigamon main bijepi ko bahumat hasil he
 Today, during the analysis of the results of the MCD on several channels, the questions from the anchor, reporter and experts were mainly two questions
 aap chahen to you tub par jaakar phir se dekh bhi sakate hai or aapane dekha hi hoga
 The BJP did nothing in ten years, there was corruption and filth, yet it won in a fierce manner
 bijepi ne naaraazgi se bachane ke liye apane sabhi parshadon ke tikat kaat diye
 Will also listen to the answers of the spokesmen
 shaayad hi kisi ne kaha hoga ki hamaare das saal ke kaam par vot mila he
 Everyone named Prime Minister Modi
 ankaron or jaankaron ne baar-baar kaha ki bijepi ne 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat diye
 i hope that the questions of corruption and filth have got place during the election also
 jab khud hi nahin kiya to dusron se kya ummid
 There is another aspect of the 153 councilors' ticket-cutting strategy
 jisaki charchaa nahin hui yaa kam hui
 Which is the party that cuts the ticket of 153 councilors and does not rebel
 tikat katane vaale chand parshadon ne hi baghaavat kii, baaki shant hi rahe
 Even after this, the party expelled 21 leaders in rebellion
 is lihaaz se dekhenge to aaj ke samay main aisa karne kii himmat kisi bhi dal main nahin he
 Even if one party cuts the ticket, then at that moment they will be seen subscribing to the other party
 magar bijepi ke 100 se adhik parshad tikat katane ke baad bhi party ke liye kaam karte rahe
 This gives an idea of how active BJP is as an organization and how much control it has
 lekin chunaav dar chunaav jeetne vaali party ke rashtriya adhyaksh kahaan the, jab itani badi jeet mil rahi thi
 Amit Shah has returned to Bengal where his party did not win the assembly elections held last year
 2016 shuru hote hi netaji kii tamaam filein saarvajanik hone lagi thim, tivi ankaron ne netaji khub bahes kii, lekin bijepi ko seat mili 3
 Within a year of such a huge defeat, Amit Shah has returned to Bengal
 naksalbari main party kaaryakarta ke ghar bhojan kar rahe hai
 Amit Shah will have many reasons to celebrate the victory and stay in Delhi, but he is walking there
 amit shah agle saal bengal ke sthaneey nikaay chunaavon kii taiyaari main jute gaye hai
 The BJP won a historic victory in the UP Assembly on March 11, but ten days later i saw a news in the media that Amit Shah would go to Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu on March 21 to attend an RSS meeting
 2016 main tamilnadu vidhansabha main bijepi ko zero seat mili thi, mat pratishat tha 2
 8 percent
 iske baad bhi amit shah or unki bijepi vahaan bhidi hui he
 Do you know of the president of any party at the present time who goes to a place where he has suffered a big defeat even after a big win
 amit shah kii jagah agar koi doosraa adhyaksh hota to kai maheene tak dilli se hi nahin nikalataa
 It is true that in today's media there is only the bjp's side, there are questions in its color, the opposition is mocked but the reason for the defeat is also the laziness of the opposition
 chunaav kaise ladaa ja rahaa he, ladane par paisa pani kii tarah bahaya ja rahaa he in sab baton se bharat kii janata ko koi takalif nahin he
 Now the talk of the Aam Aadmi Party
 aaj jab virdohi or aalochak sirf itani ummid kar rahe the ki apni haar sweekaar kar le, magar aap ne electronic voting mashin main gadabadi par apana vishwaas banaae rakhaa
 All journalists from the survey had said that you will lose the MCD
 punjab haarane par aap ne yahi to kaha tha ki patrkaar bhi aap ke jeetne kii baat kar rahe the
 Aam Aadmi Party MLA Alka Lamba has resigned from the legislature and claimed responsibility for defeat in her constituency
 alka kaa kahana he ki haar ke or bhi kaaran the jo zamin par dikh rahe the
 Convenor Dilip Pandey has also resigned
 usee tarah se congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ajay maakan ne bhi haar ke baad istipha de diya
 In-charge PC Chacko has also resigned
 agar istipha dene vaale kisi kaa naam chhot gaya ho to main kaan pakad kar maafee maangata hum
 Now the problem is that those who have the responsibility of accepting these resignations, resignation is also being sought from them
 meri raay main har dal main ek istipha sachiv hona chahie jiske paas adhyaksh se lekar vidhayak tak kaa istipha sweekaar karne kaa power ho
 Apart from the Aam Aadmi Party, another party was taking part in the MCD elections for the first time, which has emerged from the same, Swaraj India
 117 mahilaon ko tikat diya, paryaavaran ko mudda banaaya
 The people of Delhi proved that it does not just want goodness
 subah se jaankaar arvind kejariwal ke anhakaar par piechdi kar rahe the, agar unhen vinamrata kii itani hi talab thi to yogendra yadav kaa twit dekhnaa chahie tha, or dilli se puch sakate the ki yogendra ji kii vinamrata main aisi kya kami thi jo ek bhi seat nahin mili
 In the morning, his tweet came that the counting of MCD is starting
 main shunya apekshaaon ke saath shuru kar rahaa hum
 Apart from this, whatever comes will be a bonus
 raajnneeti main aisi bhashaa ab kahaan bachi he lekin aisi bhashaa se bhi vot nahin mila, phir bhi aap ye nahin kah sakate ki bharat kii raajnneeti main sharafat nahin bachi he
 After the results, Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India tweeted another, Swaraj India did not get any seat as expected
 abhi tak vot share ke number nahin aae hai, par ummid se kam lag rahaa he
 We also need to introspect
 tippaniyan Finally, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's tweet also showed a glimpse of humility
 main bijepi ko teenon emsidi main vijay par badhai detaa hum, meri sarkaar dilli kii behatari ke liye emsidi ke saath milakar kaam karne ke liye taiyaar he
 There is no use talking on issues or not, now the election took place

 There is no use talking on issues or not, now the election took place
 yah jeet un 46 fisadi logon kii bhi he, jinhone vot nahin daale
 The BJP has won the MCD elections for the third consecutive time since 2007, 2012
 congress 2012 kii tulana main aadhe se bhi kam ho gai he
 Won in 30 wards only
 pehali baar chunaav lard rahi aam aadmi party ko 48 ward main jeet mili he
 BJP has won in 181 wards
 uttari emsidi ke 104 main se 64 ward main bijepi vijayi rahi he
 The BJP won 70 of 104 wards of the Southern MCD
 purvi emsidi ke 64 ward main se 48 ward main bijepi jiti he
 BJP has a majority in three corporations
 aaj kai channelon par emsidi ke nateezon ke vishleshan ke dauraan, ankar, reporter or visheshgyon ke sawaalon main do sawaal mukhya rup se the
 If you want, you can go to youtube and watch it again and you must have seen it
 bijepi ne das saal main kuch nahin kiya, bhrashtachar or gandagi rahi, phir bhi prachand tareeke se jeet gai
 The BJP cut all its councilors' tickets to avoid heartburn
 pravaktaaon ke jawaab bhi suniyegaa
 Hardly anyone would have said that we got a vote on our ten years of work
 sabane pradhanmantri modi kaa naam liya
 Anchors and experts have repeatedly said that BJP cut tickets for 153 councilors
 ummid karata hum ki chunaav ke dauraan bhi bhrashtachar or gandagi ke sawaalon ko jagah mili hogi
 What to expect from others when they have not done it themselves 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat dene kii ranneeti kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he
 Which was not discussed or reduced
 aisi koun si party he jo 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat de or baghaavat na ho
 Only a few councilors who cut tickets revolted, the rest remained silent
 iske baad bhi party ne 21 netaaon ko baghaavat ke jurm main nikaal diya
 In this context, no party has the courage to do so in today's time
 agar koi dal tikat kaat bhi de to usee kshan wo duusare dal kii sadsyta lete nazar aaenge
 But more than 100 councilors of BJP continued to work for the party even after the ticket was cut
 isse andaaza miltaa he ki ek sanghathan ke rup main bijepi kitni sakriy he or uskaa kitna niyantran he
 But where was the national president of the election-winning party, when such a big victory was being won
 amit shah us bengal main laut gaye hai jahaan pichley saal hue vidhansabha chunaav main unki party ko jeet nahin mili
 At the start of 2016, all the files of Netaji were going public, TV anchors debated Netaji a lot, but BJP got 3 seats
 itani badi haar ke ek saal ke bheetar amit shah bengal laut gaye hai
 In Naxalbari, the party workers are having their meals
 amit shah ke paas jeet kaa jashn manaane or dilli main rahane ke kai kaaran honge, magar ve vahaan padayatra kar rahe hai
 Amit Shah is gearing up for Bengal's local body elections next year
 11 march ko upi vidhansabha main bijepi ko aitihaasik jeet mili lekin uske das din baad media main maine ek khabar dekhi ki amit shah 21 march tamilnadu ke coimbatore jaayenge, aresas kii ek baithak main hissaa lene ke liye
 In 2016, the BJP got zero seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, the vote percentage was 2
 8 pratishat
 Even after this, Amit Shah and his BJP are clashing there
 kya aap vartmaan samay main kisi bhi dal ke adhyaksh ke bare main jaanate hai jo badi jeet ke baad bhi vahaan chalaa jaataa he jahaan use badi haar mili hoti he
 If there was another president in place of Amit Shah, he would not leave Delhi for several months
 yah sahi he ki aaj kii media main bijepi kaa hi paksh rahata he usee ke rang main sawaal hote hai, vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he lekin haar kaa kaaran vipaksh kaa aalasy bhi he
 The people of India have no problem with how these elections are being fought, money is being shed like water
 ab baat aam aadmi party kii
 Today, when the opponents and critics were only hoping to accept their defeat, AAP maintained its belief in the malfunction in the electronic voting machine
 survey se lekar tamaam patrakaron ne kaha tha ki aap emsidi haaregi
 When Punjab lost, you said that journalists were also talking about winning
 aam aadmi party kii vidhayak alka lamba ne vidhayaki se istipha de diya he or apane kshetra main haar kii zimmedaari lee he
 Alka says there were other reasons for the defeat that were visible on the ground
 sanyojak dilip pandey ne bhi istipha de diya he
 Similarly, state Congress president Ajay Maken also resigned after the defeat
 prabharee pisi chaako ne bhi istipha de diya he
 If someone who has resigned has missed the name, then i apologize with an ear
 ab problem ye he ki jin par in istifon ke sweekaar karne kii zimmedaari he, unase bhi to istipha maanga ja rahaa he
 In my opinion, there should be a resignation secretary in every party who has the power to accept the resignation from the Speaker to the MLA
 emsidi chunaav main aam aadmi party ke alaava ek or party pehali baar hissaa le rahi thi, jo usee se nikali hui he, swaraj india
 Gave tickets to 117 women, making environment an issue
 dilli kii janata ne sabit kar diya ki use sirf achchhai nahin chahie
 Since the morning, Arvind was doing phd on Kejriwal's arrogance, if he had such a call for humility, he should have seen Yogendra Yadav's tweet, and could have asked Delhi what was lacking in Yogendraji's humility, which even a single seat Not found subah- subah unka twit aayaa ki emsidi kii ginati shuru ho rahi he
 I'm starting with zero expectations
 iske alaava jo bhi aayega wo bonus hoga
 Where is such a language now left in politics but even with such a language, there is no vote, yet you cannot say that there is no Sharafat left in Indian politics
 nattejey aane ke baad swaraj india ke yogendra yadav ne ek or twit kiya, ummid ke anusaar swaraj india ko koi seat nahin mili
 The vote share numbers are yet to come, but it seems less than expected
 hamen bhi aatmamanthan karne kii zarurat he
 The comments ant main dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke twit main bhi vinamrata kii jhalak mili
 i congratulate the BJP on victory in all three mcds, my government is ready to work with the MCD for the betterment of Delhi
 muddon par chunaav hua yaa nahin, ab is par baat karne se koi phayda nahin he
 This victory is also for 46 percent of the people who did not cast their votes
 aaj kai channelon par emsidi ke nateezon ke vishleshan ke dauraan, ankar, reporter or visheshgyon ke sawaalon main do sawaal mukhya rup se the
 If you want, you can go to youtube and watch it again and you must have seen it
 bijepi ne das saal main kuch nahin kiya, bhrashtachar or gandagi rahi, phir bhi prachand tareeke se jeet gai
 The BJP cut all its councilors' tickets to avoid heartburn
 pravaktaaon ke jawaab bhi suniyegaa
 Hardly anyone would have said that we got a vote on our ten years of work

 Anchors and experts have repeatedly said that BJP cut tickets for 153 councilors
 ummid karata hum ki chunaav ke dauraan bhi bhrashtachar or gandagi ke sawaalon ko jagah mili hogi
 What to expect from others when they have not done it themselves 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat dene kii ranneeti kaa ek doosraa pahalu bhi he
 Which was not discussed or reduced
 aisi koun si party he jo 153 parshadon ke tikat kaat de or baghaavat na ho
 Only a few councilors who cut tickets revolted, the rest remained silent
 iske baad bhi party ne 21 netaaon ko baghaavat ke jurm main nikaal diya
 In this context, no party has the courage to do so in today's time
 agar koi dal tikat kaat bhi de to usee kshan wo duusare dal kii sadsyta lete nazar aaenge
 But more than 100 councilors of BJP continued to work for the party even after the ticket was cut
 isse andaaza miltaa he ki ek sanghathan ke rup main bijepi kitni sakriy he or uskaa kitna niyantran he
 But where was the national president of the election-winning party, when such a big victory was being won
 amit shah us bengal main laut gaye hai jahaan pichley saal hue vidhansabha chunaav main unki party ko jeet nahin mili
 At the start of 2016, all the files of Netaji were going public, TV anchors debated Netaji a lot, but BJP got 3 seats
 itani badi haar ke ek saal ke bheetar amit shah bengal laut gaye hai
 In Naxalbari, the party workers are having their meals
 amit shah ke paas jeet kaa jashn manaane or dilli main rahane ke kai kaaran honge, magar ve vahaan padayatra kar rahe hai
 Amit Shah is gearing up for Bengal's local body elections next year
 11 march ko upi vidhansabha main bijepi ko aitihaasik jeet mili lekin uske das din baad media main maine ek khabar dekhi ki amit shah 21 march tamilnadu ke coimbatore jaayenge, aresas kii ek baithak main hissaa lene ke liye
 In 2016, the BJP got zero seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, the vote percentage was 2
 8 pratishat
 Even after this, Amit Shah and his BJP are clashing there
 kya aap vartmaan samay main kisi bhi dal ke adhyaksh ke bare main jaanate hai jo badi jeet ke baad bhi vahaan chalaa jaataa he jahaan use badi haar mili hoti he
 If there was another president in place of Amit Shah, he would not leave Delhi for several months
 yah sahi he ki aaj kii media main bijepi kaa hi paksh rahata he usee ke rang main sawaal hote hai, vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he lekin haar kaa kaaran vipaksh kaa aalasy bhi he
 The people of India have no problem with how these elections are being fought, money is being shed like water
 ab baat aam aadmi party kii
 Today, when the opponents and critics were only hoping to accept their defeat, AAP maintained its belief in the malfunction in the electronic voting machine
 survey se lekar tamaam patrakaron ne kaha tha ki aap emsidi haaregi
 When Punjab lost, you said that journalists were also talking about winning

 Alka says there were other reasons for the defeat that were visible on the ground
 sanyojak dilip pandey ne bhi istipha de diya he
 Similarly, state Congress president Ajay Maken also resigned after the defeat

 amit shah us bengal main laut gaye hai jahaan pichley saal hue vidhansabha chunaav main unki party ko jeet nahin mili
 At the start of 2016, all the files of Netaji were going public, TV anchors debated Netaji a lot, but BJP got 3 seats
 itani badi haar ke ek saal ke bheetar amit shah bengal laut gaye hai
 In Naxalbari, the party workers are having their meals
 amit shah ke paas jeet kaa jashn manaane or dilli main rahane ke kai kaaran honge, magar ve vahaan padayatra kar rahe hai
 Amit Shah is gearing up for Bengal's local body elections next year
 11 march ko upi vidhansabha main bijepi ko aitihaasik jeet mili lekin uske das din baad media main maine ek khabar dekhi ki amit shah 21 march tamilnadu ke coimbatore jaayenge, aresas kii ek baithak main hissaa lene ke liye
 In 2016, the BJP got zero seats in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, the vote percentage was 2
 8 pratishat
 Even after this, Amit Shah and his BJP are clashing there
 kya aap vartmaan samay main kisi bhi dal ke adhyaksh ke bare main jaanate hai jo badi jeet ke baad bhi vahaan chalaa jaataa he jahaan use badi haar mili hoti he
 If there was another president in place of Amit Shah, he would not leave Delhi for several months
 yah sahi he ki aaj kii media main bijepi kaa hi paksh rahata he usee ke rang main sawaal hote hai, vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaaya jaataa he lekin haar kaa kaaran vipaksh kaa aalasy bhi he
 The people of India have no problem with how these elections are being fought, money is being shed like water

 Recently, Congress President Rahul Gandhi announced the Minimum Income Scheme (justice) Scheme, which said that if the Congress returned to power, it gave 20 percent of the poorest families in the country an annual cash amount of up to Rs 72,000

 is ghoshnaa ke baad chaaron taraf charchaa kaa yah vishay ban gaya ki kya desh ke vittiya halaat ko dekhte hue aisa sambhav ho paaegaa? or is ghoshnaa ke baad loksabhaa chunaav main congress party ko kitna phayda hoga
 Will Congress Benefit From Justice? Congress is expected to woo voters on the basis of below poverty line (BPL) population in 208 parliamentary constituencies of various states where it can compete directly with NDA

 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in directly contested state of Congress and BJP, Congress was able to win only 9 seats from 128 seats of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, but this time the party has its 'justice' The figure in these states is expected to improve further under the plan
 in rajyon main bipiel aabaadi madhya pradesh main 32%, gujarat main 17%, rajasthan main 15%, assam main 32%, punjab main 8%, chhattisgarh main 40%, uttarakhand main 11%, himachal pradesh main 8% he
 In these states, the Congress has a direct contest with the BJP
 congress ko kadi chunauti vaale rajyakaha jaataa he ki loksabhaa chunaav main dilli kaa rasta uttar pradesh se hokar jaataa he, to aise main congress uttar pradesh main acha pradarshan karnaa chaahegi
 The Congress may face a tough challenge in Uttar Pradesh as well as in West Bengal and Odisha
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main in rajyon main 143 loksabhaa seat main congress kul 6 site hi jeet pai thi
 29% of households in Uttar Pradesh, 20% in West Bengal and 33% in Odisha are below the poverty line
 congress ke majboot gathbandhan vaale rajyamaharashtra, bihar, tamilnadu, karnataka, kerala, jharkhand jaise rajyon main 189 siten hai jahaan congress kul 87 siton par chunaav lard rahi he
 This time the Congress has formed a strong alliance with regional parties in these states, so that they can prevent the BJP from coming to power
 congress ko ummid he ki in 87 main se aadhi siton par vah apni jeet hasil kare
 Significantly, there are a large number of BPL families in these states
 maharashtra main 17 fisadi, bihar main 34 fisadi, tamilnadu main 11 fisadi, karnataka main 21 fisadi, kerala main 7 fisadi or jharkhand main 37 fisadi parivaar garibi rekha se neeche hai
 In such a situation, if the Congress delivers its message to the voters, then its expectations can also be raised

 The rajdar Baba Ram Rahim's special ruler, Honeypreet, is coming out one by one as soon as human beings arrive behind bars
 haniprit ram rahim ke parivaar se kis kadar jalati thi wo to haal hi main saamne ai ek video se saaf ho chukaa he
 In this, she is seen recovering her hair by jerking the hand of Gurmeet Ram Rahim's wife
 vah naa keval ram rahim kii patni harjit cor se jalati or nafrat karti thi, balki baba ko uske parivaar se dur rakhane kii koshish main bhi lagi rahati thi
 Now a very big conspiracy of Honeypreet Insan towards Ram Rahim's family has been exposed
 ram rahim ke bete jasmit insaan ke kaarobaar ko chaupat karne ke peeche bhi haniprit kaa hi haath saamne aayaa he
 She wanted to mix Jasmeet's status in the soil
 isi ke chalate usne ek sajeesh ke tahat jasmit kii factriyon ko band karvaa diya or uske baad main uskaa puraa kaarobaar apane kabje main le liya tha
 Honeypreet was jealous of Jasmeet once Ram Rahim suddenly declared her his heir
 haniprit nahin chaahati thi ki jasmit ram rahim kaa vaaris bane
 Due to this jealousy, he once declared himself the heir of Ram Rahim in his Facebook account
 haniprit ke premjaal main fansaa ram rahim uski har baat ko pathar kii lakeer maanata tha
 Due to this weakness of Ram Rahim, Honeypreet started pressuring him after 2011, saying that the biscuits, pickles and other products being manufactured in Jasmeet's factories are inferior
 uski factriyon ko band kar diya janaa chahie
 In 1998, a new product named Father and King Three was set up by Jasmeet, who set up a biscuit factory named Father
 mahaj 50 karmchaariyon ke saath shuru kiye gaye is vyapaar ko dhire-dhire pankh lagane lage
 Jasmeet's biscuits started selling in many cities besides Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan
 uske baad jasmit ne apane utpaadon main namakeen, jam, achaar or duusare utpaadon kaa nirmaan bhi shuru kar diya
 They were launched in the name of King Three
 sutron ke mutabik saal 2015 main jasmit kaa salanaa kaarobaar 15 karod rupee ke paar pahunch gaya tha
 Honeypreet, who was involved in a conspiracy against Jasmeet, was not liking her success, burning with Honeypreet
 vah uske khilaaf sajeesh karne main juty rahi
 She went on to discredit Jasmeet's factories by making biscuits, namkeen, pickles, jams and other products as inferior
 haniprit kii sajeesh ke chalate dhire-dhire jasmit kaa kaarobaar simtane laga

 As the layer of scam is opening in Punjab National Bank, one thing has emerged that the banking system in the country has remained the same during the last two-three decades
 desh ke bainkon main aaj bhi un tareekon se dhokhajhadi kii ja sakati he jinka sahaara harshad mehat or kethan paarikh jaise ghotalebaj le chuke hai
 If the banking system can be breached with such ease, then why do banks not provide adequate security despite big scams? Nirav Modi, the prime accused in the PNB scam, once again accused scams like Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parikh Has been put in front of the country
 pehle se hi enpie kii samasya se jujh rahe desh ke sarkari bainkon main vittiya suraksha ke naam par kya kadam uthaaya gaya he vah is baat se saaf ho jaataa he ki beete do-teen dashakon ke dauraan ek ke baad ek ghotalebaj ek hi tareeke se bank ke pramukh dwaar se andar aate hai, banking niyamon kaa sahaara lete hai or karondon kii rakam kaa chuunaa laga dete hai
 Two decades ago, it was very easy for Ketan Parikh and Harshad Mehta to make a business payment with bank money by resorting to a bank manager in any of his business dealings
 neerav ne bhi isi tarj par letters of anderstanding, pe order, bair credit or letters of confort jaise bank instruments kaa sahaara liya
 The provision of these methods in banking rules is for effecting a transaction between two banks in a limited time
 ise padhein: PNB mahaghotaalaa! bank main jamaa aapke har 100 rupee main se 30 gaayab?2001 main kethan paarikh ne madhavpura marcentile kuoparative bank (memasibi) ke aise hi inter bank pe order kaa istemaal bisai stock exange par bhugtan karne ke liye kiya tha
 Parikh also did not keep enough security with the bank for these pay orders and in the end the bank suffered
 haalanki bank ne paarikh ke pe order ko munaane se tab manaa kiya jab pement ke liye uske paas paryaapt fund maujuud nahin tha
 Read this: PNB lost Rs 11,300 crore to 'jugaad' in the bank Nirav Modi Before this, in 1992, Harshad Mehta also took stock market boom by resorting to such limited term bank instruments
 mehta ne apane saathiyon ke milakar bank ke is credit kaa sahaara lete hue shares kii kharid karne ke liye pement kiye
 But when banks started running out of funds, they took steps to recover the money from Mehta and his associates
 haalanki bank ke kadam uthaane tak donon bank kii banlensashit or share bazaar kii chaal kamjor pad gai
 According to the FIR registered by the CBI in the PNB case, the same formula has been resorted to in the current fraud
 neerav modi kii companiyon ko jari anderteking ke liye bank main margin mani nahin jamaa karai gai thi
 Therefore, all the money withdrawn by Modi was directly entered into the bank account
 kya enpie kii samasya se jujh rahe bainkon ko pienbi ghotaale ke baad apni vittiya suraksha ko nae sire se majboot karne kii jarurat nahin he yaa phir unhen phir kisi ghotalebaj kii intjaar rahegaa jo sarkari khajaane par daaka daalane kaa kaam karegaa

 If sex is done correctly, those moments spent in bed with topartner may prove to be better than exercise or yoga
 ektaaja researchse pataa chalaa he ki partner ke saath badhiya dhang se kiya gaya sex yogasana se zyada phydemand hota he
 There is no better medicine than sex to reduce the stress of life
 itnaa hi nahin, agar bistar par apane partner ke saath kuch vishesh poj main sex kiya jaae, to puure sharir main rakt kaa sanchaar bahut teji se hota he, jo hryday ke liye kaaphi phydemand rahata he
 Based on the results of the research, it has been said that most women are unable to keep their focus during sex, which makes them feel that sex is just a minor task or rather boring
 yahi vajah he ki agar jivan ke un khaas lamhon ko sahi tareeke se kiya jaae, to aapako or aapke partner, donon ko hi charmotkarsh jarur praapt hota he
 Foreplay also has an important role before having sex

 Try to pull your partner towards you with your hot breaths and lift your body up

 According to the letter, Pandit was not immediately removed because it would have sent the wrong message to the market but his departure is possible soon

 ise ek siddhant maane to kah sakate hai ki mahatma gandhi manushyon main hira maane-jane jaaenge
 They are bodiless
 phir bhi sarvatra hai, apane lambey karmmay jivan or vichaar ke bal par
 The urge to understand and know his life message has increased
 unka jivan sandesh sutara main he
 Is in a sentence
 jo taabeej unhone diya vah to thodaa lanbaa he
 It takes him some time to study
 lekin unke jivan sandesh ko koi bhi mantra kii tarah aasaani se yaad kar saktaa he
 May remember him forever
 gandhiji ne anek avasaron par use bataaya he ki 'meraa jivan hi meraa sandesh he
 Gandhi's life message is also on the cover of two thick books in which the historical account of Sevagram is printed
 prashn yah he ki unke jivan sandesh kaa paath kya he?kya unke jivan sandesh ko rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne samajha he? yah prashn atapata bhi lag saktaa he par he samayik or atyant mahatvapurn kyonki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh bhartiya janajivan par chaaya hua he
 Has become a 'shaktipunj'
 uski upasthiti ko koi chaahe yaa nahin, kisi ke chaahane or na chaahane se uski 'shakti' aprabhavit he
 Such Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh should be asked, what is the country and the world doing when Mahatma Gandhi-150 is persuading them to assimilate? On September 17,18,19 last year, a lecture was held at Vigyan Bhawan, Delhi
 vaktaa the-dow
 Mohan Bhagwat
 ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sarasanghachaalak hai
 He was eager to listen
 vigyaan bhawan chota pad gaya tha
 He said, answered the questions
 sambhavat: pehali baar koi vivaad utpann nahin hua
 The association of the dispute with the union is very old
 unase jo-jo prashn puche gaye, unamem kisi ne bhi yah nahin poocha ki sangh gandhi ji ke raste par kyon chalanaa chahta he? aisa kyon hua? iskaa ek kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki maan liya gaya ho ki sangh ne gandhi ji ko apana liya he
 The opposite can also happen
 jaanane kii baat duusari he
 That is, when did the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and the Sangh formed and what did the Sangh learn from it and adopted the Gandhi idea? a dispute is in the union
 doosraa vivaad sangh se baahar he
 If these two divisions of the whole dispute are done, then the matter will become a little easier
 sangh main gandhi ko hindu-muslim sambandhon ke drushtikon se zyada dekha gaya he
 Others have been looking at the Sangh politically
 is aadhaar par sangh par akshep lage, bhale hi ve niraadhaar hon
 There is no need to count those attacks
 use sab jaanate hai
 Dr
 Mahatma, who was jailed in the non-cooperation Movement and Civil Disobedience Movement on Mahatma Gandhi's appeal
 headgavar ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kyon banaaya, is prashn par 'shuru se hi samvaad or vivaad' he
 Dr
 to not let the Khilafat movement lead to future consequences
 headgavar ne congress chodi or ek rashtriya andolan khadaa karne kaa bidaa uthaaya
 This is the time when Mahatma Gandhi was going to take charge of the Congress
 sambhraant nagarikon or vakeelon kii congress ko jan saadhaaran se jodgaye ke liye unhone congress ko swarajya kii bhartiya sabhyatamoolak jadon se joda
 On the surface, the path of Mahatma Gandhi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is parallel, which is not found anywhere
 dow
 Hedgewar is in touch with the revolutionaries while Mahatma Gandhi is adamant on non-violence
 yah samanaantar dhara he
 But deep down, the source of both is one
 vah kranti main he
 It was understood by Swadhyaya, a thought man of the Sangh
 ve the-baba sahab apte
 He was rich
 unke hi prayaason se sangh ne mahatma gandhi kaa naam subah kii prarthana main 'shaamil' kiya
 It is from 1964
 ve aksar kehete the ki mahatma gandhi bharat kii aatma the or vir saavarkar sharir
 Then he used to ask what would happen to the soul without a body? There is a disagreement on the Muslim question of Mahatma Gandhi of the Sangh
 is asahmati ke baavjood dow
 Hedgewar accepted Mahatma Gandhi
 unke samay main sangh kaa jo sahitya he, vah mahatma gandhi se nitigat virodh ke baavjood unke prati sammaan prakat karata he
 Dr
 headgavar or mahatma gandhi pehali baar 1934 main mili
 When Gandhiji completed the idea of a new experiment after completing his country-wide journey for the prevention of untouchability, he chose Sevagram
 ve wardha main rah rahe the
 Jamnalal was a guest of Bajaj
 unke hi aagrah par ve rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke shivi main gaye
 Dr
 headgavar kii jeevani main is bare main ek adhyay hi he, gandhiji se bhent
 The author is Narayan Hari Palkar
 jis din gandhiji shivi main gaye or swayamsevakon se baat kii, us din dow
 Hedgewar was not
 unki bhent agle din hui
 It is mentioned in Gandhi Vadmay
 12 sitambar, 1947 kii prarthana sabha main gandhi ji hindu or musalmaan se shanti banaae rakhane kii apil kar rahe hai
 In the same context, he has a sentence that "muslims wanted Pakistan, they got it
" ab kyon ladate hai? kya pakistan mil gaya to sara hindustan le lenge? vah kabhi hone vaala nahin he
 On the other hand, he says about the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that "I had heard that the Sangh's hands are also blood-stained
" guruji ne mujhe aashwaasan dilaayaa ki yah jhooth he
 Their organization is nobody's enemy
 
 
 
 
 vah to apni samarth bhar hindustan kii raksha karnaa chaahati he
 At the same time, Gandhiji also attended a rally of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 vahaan unhone kaha ki 'sangh ke khilaaf jo aarope hai, unamem koi sachaai he yaa nahin, yah main nahin jaanata
 It is the work of the Sangh to prove these allegations to be false by their consistent actions
 'aadhunik itihaas kii teen ghatnaon ne mahatma gandhi ko apriy bahes kaa vishay bana rakhaa he
 His acceptance of the partition of India, his insistence on getting Pakistan Rs 55 crore and declaring Jawaharlal Nehru as his political successor are examples that demand to be understood in the right context
 iske liye swasth or santulit bahes ho to usamen se do baaten avashya niklengi
 One that the Congress had made Gandhi ji helpless by the time he got to independence, though the chanting of his name continued
 aisa kyon hua? kisne kiya? kya jo hua usase alag or sukhad yah ho saktaa tha ki gandhi ji ne jo apane liye soch rakhaa tha, us nae prayog kaa unhen avasar miltaa
 If that were the case, the other thing would also have been recorded in history
 vah yah ki gandhi apane sapane kaa swarajya sthapit karne ke liye jo-jo kaam karte usamen rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa ve sahyog usee tarah lete jaise lokanayak jaiprakash narayan ne bala sahab devaras se baat kar andolan ke liye sahyog maanga
 The assassination of Gandhiji did not end this epoch-making possibility, but must have started a new chapter in the infertile debate on the real bearer of the Gandhi idea
 gandhijan ko teen hisson main baant diya
 Government, Mathi and Kujat
 chauthe main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh aata he
 Gandhiji has said that the last thing he said on the same subject is authentic
 ise aam taur par bhula diya gaya he
 The last time he dissolved the Congress and formed the Lok Sevak Sangh and the composition of its five institutions
 jisamen khaadi, gramodyog, goseva, asprishyata nivaaran or shiksha ke vishay the
 Similarly, in Hind Swaraj, he may have rejected the lawyer, the doctor and the parliament, but since 1934 he has promoted the Congress in parliamentary politics
 aarthik udaarikaran kii ghoshnaa hote hi jis vyakti ne swadeshi abhiyaan ke liye apil kii ve tab ke sarasanghachaalak bala sahab devaras the
 It is a different matter that after the formation of BJP governments, the Swadeshi campaign took the Sangh to a very deep cold storage
 gandhi-150 ke saal main dharmpal kii yaad bahut swaabhaavik he
 He brought the Sangh closer to the Gandhi idea
 dharmpal ne sangh ke alaava bauddhikon or yuvakon ko gandhi vichaar se prerit kiya
 Sadly, no movement came out of that inspiration
 iskaa kaaran khojein to pataa chalegaa ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne pahal nahin kii
 Incorporated some of Gandhi's ideas
 utana kaaphi nahin he
 The way the Sangh works is institutionalized
 sach yah bhi he ki gandhi vichaar ke prati sangh netritv or swayamsevakon main alanghneey khai bani hui he
 Yes, there are exceptions
 lekin yah dharna bhi he ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa vishwaas hindu raashtra main he or iske maanane vaale kabhi dharmanirpeksh nahin ho sakate
 On this basis, what they see in the Sangh, they consider it as anti-gandhi
 yahaan dharmanirpekshata kii samaj kaa prashn he
 One of its understanding originates from the west and the other from the eternal tradition of India
 yun kahen ki gandhi vichaar kii marxvaadi vyakhya main sangh gandhi virdohi hi rahegaa
 In Sanatan tradition, Sangh will also be among those who follow the Gandhi idea
 bharat vividhtaon kaa samaaj he or rahaa he
 Those who consider it to be different will not understand Gandhiji whatever they say
 rajya vyavastha kii punarrachana ke liye bhi gandhiji ke panchayat sambandhi vichaar par jitna kaam hona chahie vah dikhataa nahin he
 The Sangh can give it the form of a movement
