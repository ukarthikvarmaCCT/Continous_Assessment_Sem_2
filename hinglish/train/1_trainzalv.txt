european unioniske baad europe main karency ke saath badi chhedchhad kaa doosraa mauka janvari 2002 main aayaa, jab european union ke 11deshon ne nai euro karency lagu kii (baad main 12wein desh greece ne lagu kiya)
 However, Euro was born in 1999 and all these countries were preparing to declare this new currency as legal tender for three years
 yah ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti or lambii taiyaari kaa nateeja tha ki europe ke in 12 deshon main naikrency ko safaltaake saath launch kar diya gaya
 In the last days, Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorvachov started the demonetisation process in his last days
 gorvachov kaa makasad bhi arthvyavastha se blikemani ban chuke rubal ko baahar karnaa tha
 Therefore, the currency of 50 and 100 rubles was banned there
 yah karency unkiarthvyavastaaka ek-tihaai hissaa tha
 This currency reform program could not control inflation in the Soviet Union
 vahiin, udaarikaran or raajnneetik or aarthik sudhaar (prestroika or glavenost) se popular hui gorvachov sarkaar teji se anpopular hui or dekhte hi dekhte agast aate-aate soviet union vighatan kaa shikaar ho gai
 North Korea In 2010, North Korea undertook a major demonetization program
 tatkaaleen taanashaah kim jong dwitiya ne ek jatke main kaala bazaari or lagaam lagane or arthvyavastha ko kaabo karne ke liye desh kii sabhi karency kii vailu se do shunya hataa die the
 That is, 1000 rupees remains at just 10 rupees and 5000 notes reached the price of just 50 rupees
 is faisle ke saath-saath uttar korea ke saamne fasal kharaab kii duusari badi chunauti saamne thi
 a severe food crisis occurred in the country
 chaaval kii keemat aasmaan chune lagi
 The result was that the dictator had to apologize for the mistake, and this apology was demanded by the dictator with the death penalty to the government's finance minister
 myanmar (burma)desh kii military shashan ne 1987 main ek jatke main faisla lete hue desh kii kul karency se lagbhag 80 fisadi karency ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya
 The Janata ruler in Myanmar, like Prime Minister Modi, took this step to curb black money and black marketing
 is faisla kaa nateeja yah rahaa ki military shashan main pehali baar chaatro ne janata shaasha ke khilaaf virodh pradarshan shuru kar diya
 This protest continued for a year and then the government suppressed it with great barbarity
 antim nateeja yah rahaa ki pradarshan kar rahe hajaaron naagarik sena kii goliyon ke shikaar bane
 However, its aspect is also that only 1000 and 500 notes have been discontinued in the countries where the notebandi was implemented completely
 100, 50, 20 or 10 ke note ab bhi chal rahe hai
 At the same time, after restricting the currency of 500 and 1000 rupees, the Reserve Bank started communication of the new currency of 2000 rupees and then the new currency of 500 rupees
 iske kuch maheenon baad arthvyavastha main choti mudra kii killat ko dekhte hue rigerv bank ne 200 rupee kii bhi nai karency kaa sanchaar shuru kiya

 046 seconds of time he could not improve the one minute 32
 222 second kii 107 pratishat samay kii seemaa se baahar rahe

Whereas, on 22 December 2017, the Election Commission had announced the election for 3 Rajya Sabha seats in Delhi and a month later i
e
 on 19 January 2018, why the President was recommended to disqualify 20 mlas

 Citing government notifications, Maken claimed that the Delhi government's March 5, 2015 notification clearly showed that 21 parliamentary secretaries would be given office space in government vehicles, ministerial offices, and furniture for 21 parliamentary secretaries, etc
 a total of Rs 13,26,300 was sanctioned

 Ajay Maken asked what was the agreement between the Chief Election Commission and Aam Aadmi Party, due to which the Election Commission did not give its decision before 22 December 2017 in the ongoing case regarding the post of profit of 20 mlas
 jab chunaav ayog ne dilli kii 3 rajyasabha siton ke liye chunaav kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Maken asked what was going on between 22 December 2017 and 19 January 2018 between the Election Commission and AAP party nominated by the BJP government? Maken said that the Election Commission had given the Aam Aadmi Party one month time so that the election of their three Rajya Sabha candidates could be done easily
 kyonki unke teen ummidavaaron main se ek shri en
 D
 gupta bhi the jo ki kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ke najdiki maane jate he
 Maken said that if the Central Chief Election Commission had recommended disqualification of 20 mlas before 22 December 2017, the Aam Aadmi Party would have disbanded and only 50 per cent would have survived, which would have put a question mark on the candidature of their three Rajya Sabha candidates

 bhartiya parampara main sone ko bahut mahatv diya gaya he
 Especially on Diwali and Dhanteras, its purchase is considered auspicious
 lekin aksar sone main gadabadi kii shikaayat bhi milti he
 In this case, it is important to know how to find the purity of gold
 sone kii pahchaan ko lekar ab darane kii jarurat nahin he
 Now you too can easily identify real gold by taking care of some things
 aaie jaanate he asli sone ko pahchaanane ke ye achook tips -hollmark jewelery hi kharideshgar nakli sone kii kharidari se bachanaa chaahate hai to hameshaa hollmark jewelery hi khariden
 Hallmark or standard mark is provided by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for gold jewelery
 lekin aise main yah dekhnaa bhi jaruri he ki kahin hollmark nakli to nahin? dhyaan rakhen ki asli hollmark par bhartiya maanak beuro kaa tikona nishaan bana hota he
 Also, the purity of gold is written with the logo of the hallmarking center
 acid test se pahachanenyah bahut hi vishwasaneey or kargar tarika sabit hota he, jab aap khud se asli sone ke bare main pataa lagaana chaahate hai
 For this, apply a small scratch on the gold with a pin and then put a drop of nitric acid on that scratch
 agar vah sona nakli hoga to sona turant hi haraa ho jaayegaa or agar aap kaa sona asli he to iske rang main koi antar nahin aayega
 Magnet Test Reliable Method Whenever you go to buy gold, take a Strong Magnet with you
 yaad rakhen ki asli sona kabhi bhi chumbak par chipakata nahin he or agar sona thodaa-sa bhi chumbak ke pratiakarshith ho to samaj jaaen ki koi dikkat he or isekharidne se bachein
 See if you are immersed in water, maybe you know that gold never floats on water, but sinks
 agar aapako asli sona pahchaanana ho to ek glass pani main sone ko duboen
 If gold is completely drowned then it will be real
 agar yah pani kii sataha par tairne lage to samaj jaaen ki yah nakli he
 The price of gold is determined according to its carat
 carat jitna zyada hoga sona utana mahangaa hoga
 We buy gold 24 carat and jewelery 22 carat, which costs very little
 agar aapako 22 carat sone kii keemat pataa kerani he to 24 carat sone ke bhav main 24 kaa bhaag den or 22 se guna karen isse aapako 22 carat sone kii keemat pataa chal jaaegi
 Buy from reliable shops
 If you are still afraid of being cheated, always buy gold from reliable shops
 iske liye bade shorum or popular dukaanon par bharosa kiya ja saktaa he
 This is because big showers give you all the necessary documents about the realization of gold
 jisase aap jab ise bechney bhi jate he to aapako zyada nuksaan nahin hota
 Also, pay attention to the gold tins
 asli sone kii khanak baari hoti he jabaki nakli sona lohe ke girane jaisi aawaaj detaa he

 rld's Tabassum Hasan defeated BJP candidate Mriganka Singh in the Kairana Lok Sabha by-election in Uttar Pradesh
 vahi areldi jo pehle loksabhaa or phir vidhansabha chunaav main pitane ke baad puri tarah haashie par chali gai thi
 In Kairana, the party has revived its politics by bringing back its original vote bank Jat community from the BJP camp
 itnaa hi nahin ek baar phir areldi muslim jat ko ek saath laane main safal rahi he
 The victory of RLD has increased the stature of party chief Chaudhary Ajit Singh
 2019 main modi ke khilaaf vipakshi dalon dwaara banaae ja rahe mahagathbandhan main areldi bhi ab ahm hissaa ho sakati he
 Not only this, Ajit Singh has come in a position to negotiate respectable seats
 bataa den ki pashchimi uttar pradesh jat land kaha jaataa he
 The state has more than 10 Lok Sabha seats, where the Jat community plays the kingmaker
 inamen fatehpur sikri, mathura, aligarh, hathras, bagpat, kairana, bijanour, gajiabad, meerut or mujffarnagar loksabhaa siten shaamil hai
 However, the RLD cannot win elections on these seats alone
 iske liye gathbandhan uske liye ahm ho jaataa he
 Significantly, after the Muzaffarnagar riots in November 2013, the gap between the Jats and the Muslim community deepened in western Uttar Pradesh
 areldi kii raajnneeti ke sitare doobane lage the
 The biggest challenge before the RLD was to bring the Jat vote back in its favor, which had gone into the BJP camp after losing it in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and later in the 2017 assembly elections
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki loksabhaa chunaav main khud ajit singh haar gaye or party ek seat bhi nahin jeet saki
 While only one MLA could win the assembly elections, which later went to BJP

 The role of cheerleaders has been very special in this league ever since the Indian Premier League (IPL) started
 ipel ke maujuuda sijan se pehle cricketron or chiyarliders ke bich match ke baad mulaakaat hona aam baat thi lekin ab bisisiai ne saaf kar diya he kisi bhi haalat main cricketron or chiyarliders ke raste ek nahin hone chahie
 The cheerleaders will not only be able to go to the hotel of the cricketers but they will also not travel together
 frenchiji ke saath ek hi flite main chiyarliders nahin hongi
 The BCCI has already banned cricketers' after-match parties (post-match parties)
 bisisiai ipel ko lekar kisi bhi anchaahi controvarsi se duuri banaae rakhana chahta he
 The BCCI wants the players to focus only on the game during this cricket league
 hamaare sahyogi akhbaar mail today se baat karte hue ek frenchiji ke adhikari ne kaha, 'bisisiai har cheez ko dabl check kar rahaa he jisase controvarsi hone kaa koi scope hi na bache
 Earlier in the IPL season, cheerleaders stayed in the same hotels where cricketers used to stay
 unki flite bhi zyaadatak samay ek hi hoti thi
 The franchise official said, "banning the party after the match is a very good decision
 kyonki partiyon main kuch badmaash log bhi aa jate the jisase kaaphi dikkatein hoti thim
 i am not saying that it was always the fault of the cheerleaders, but many a times, the cricketers crossed their limits due to alcohol
 ' Leader of party sitting in top positions in rebellious state against Pankaja Munde's BJP leaders: Eknath Chandrakant Patil: People in the party are angry, we will celebrate them today is important day for Maharashtra politics
 bid jile main swargeey gopinath munde kii jayanti par unki beti pankaja munde ne raily kaa aayojan kiya he
 Pankaja has opened a front against BJP leaders after the defeat in the assembly elections
 unka saath ekanath khadse bhi de rahe hai
 Pankaja Munde has opened a front against the BJP leaders after the defeat in the assembly elections
 mana ja rahaa he ki pankaja munde jald hi bada elaan kar sakati hai
 After Eknath Khadse's speech, Pankaja Munde told the stage that when Chandrakant Patil speaks, no one will do a hooting
 devendra fadanvis ke kareebi or maharashtra bijepi adhyaksh chandrakant patil bhi gopinath munde kii jayanti ke vakt stage par maujuud rahe
 During this, Eknath whipped Devendra Fadnavis in front of Chandrakant Patil and told that the leaders in the party were feeling suffocated
 ekanath khadse ke bhaashan ke baad pankaja munde seat se uthin or logon se aagrah kiya ki jab chandrakant patil bolenge to koi hooting nahin karegaa
 Those who speak will have to listen
 mujhe choti-moti haar jhukaa nahin sakthih pankajabijepi netaa pankaja munde ne kaha, 'gopinath munde bhale hi hamaare bich nahin hai, lekin aaj bhi unhen log kitna chaahate hai yah aaj samaj aa rahaa he
 i have lost the election but the love of the people is still with me
 mujhe choti-moti chillar haar nahin jhukaa sakati he
 'pankaja Munde continued,' On December 1, i wrote a post on Facebook
 aaj 12 disambar he
 i am watching what action i am taking
 log mere bare main sutron ke hawaale se khabaren chalaa rahe the, itane bhi achche logon ke sutara the to kisi ko yah pataa kyon nahin laga ki devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar shapath lene vaale hai
 'I do not cheat anyone: Pankaja Mundepankaja said,' People are with me
 maine sangharsh yatra nikaali or mere saath log khadey rahe
 During the assembly elections, i campaigned to make Devendra Fadnavis the Chief Minister
 har vidhayak ke prachaar ke liye gai taaki maharashtra main sarkaar ban sake, lekin un logon ko laga ki maine dhokhaa karne vaali hum
 i have the rites of Gopinath Munde
 main kisi ko dhokhaa nahin detii hum
 'pankaja, who has adopted rebel attitude from BJP, said,' i have no expectation from them
 maine apane post main likhaa tha ki pratham raashtra, dwitiya party or tritiy main
 So how did those people think that i am going to cheat
 media main bhi yah baat chalaai gai ki maine party chhodane vaali hum
 Like Natha Bhau (eknath Khadse) said that if we are trying to get us out of the party door, what should we do? yah afvaah udayi gai ki maine alag party banaaungi
 People from the party started calling me a criminal
 'pankaja ne kaha ki yah afvaah udayi gai ki main alag party banaaungi
 People from the party started calling me a criminal
 ek vakt laal krishna adwani, nitin gadakari, gopinath munde bijepi ko chalaate the
 But after him, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are leading the party
 yah to ek prakriya he
 New people will come and change

 He further said that the party has now come in the hands of some people
 is party ko sabhi logon kii party bananaa he naa ki kuch logon kii
 Today i am not even a member of the core committee
 mujhe koi pad kii apeksha bhi nahin he
 i also saw tears in Supriya Sule's eyes after Ajit Pawar was sworn in
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe yah dekhakar bada dukh hua
 i know what happens when the house breaks
 maine supriya sule or mere ek kaaman dost ko yah baat bataai ki ajit pavaar kaa party chhod kar janaa mujhe acha nahin laga
 Even after this, he later got the happiness of the people, because his father Sharad Pawar was standing behind him
 'ham naaraaz logon ko manaayengeh chandrakant patilmaloom ho ki chandrakant patil devendra fadanvis ke kareebi maane jate hai
 People started hooting as soon as they came on stage
 bijepi netaa chandrakant patil ne kaha, 'party main log naaraaz hai
 We will celebrate them
 'ekanath khadse ke aaropon par maharashtra bijepi adhyaksh chandrakant patil bole ki pankaja niraash hai, lekin ham unako manaayenge
 Every leader in the BJP is part of a family
 main samaj saktaa hum ki ekanath khadse naaraaz hai, hamane unki beti ko vidhansabha chunaav main bhi tikat diya tha par chunaav ke nattejey hamaare mutabik nahin aae
 'he said,' i promise that we will resolve every complaint and the resentment will be removed
 ghar kii ladaai ghar main honi chahie use sadak par nahin laana chahie
 'pankaja Munde will not resign: BJP leader Eknath Khadse said at a rally held in Eknath Beed's Parali,' i will not speak against the party, but i want to tell that the party leaders sitting in the top positions of the party in the state are not good
 pankaja munde ko bijepi ke hi netaaon ne haraaya he
 Although Pankaja Munde will not resign, i cannot say anything about myself
 'purv mukhyamantridevendra fadanvis par nishaanaa sadhate hue ekanath khadsene kaha, 'aaj main bhartiya janata party main hum, lekin mujhase kaha gaya he isliye main party ke khilaaf nahin boluungaa
 But i can speak against the leaders of the party
 jinhone mithi baaten karke apano ke hi peeth main khanjar ghonp diya
 He further said that Gopinath Munde fought throughout the life and raised the party
 wo saaf bolte the ki maine kisi ke saath galat nahin kiya or naa hi kar saktaa
 But by stabbing some people in the back, people became the Chief Minister
 party ke bade netaa aajkal bijepi main ghutan mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Keeping up the Eknath Khadsebagi stance, he said, 'gopinath Munde, who worked so hard to make the BJP stand, has forced his daughter Pankaja Munde to fight
 iske liye main purv mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kaa aabhaar maanata hum
 'he said,' Devendra Fadnavis did not allow the memorial to be built: After the death of Eknath Gopinath Munde, i proposed to the Chief Minister for his memorial at that time, but he refused
 phir jab uddhav thakare mukhyamantri bane to unhone smarak ke liye tatkaal prastaav ko paas kar diya
 'eknath Khadseene said,' What crime did i commit by which my ticket was cut
 naa chori kii or naa hi bhrashtachar kiya
 What has happened to me today at the party can also happen to Pankaja Tai
 maine pankaja munde ke saath khadaa hum

 vahiin, ab jharkhand mukti morcha ne aadhi se zyada siton kii demand karke congress or argedy ko baichaiyn kar diya he
 The result of this is that the seat sharing formula among the remaining parties in the Grand Alliance is not being decided
 jeemem ke formule ne uljhaai batabata den ki jeemem ne congress ke saamne nayaa formula rakhaa he
 Under this, JMM has announced to contest on 42 seats out of total 81 assembly seats in the state
 jabaki, 39 vidhansabha siten baaki sahyogi dalon ke liye chhod di he
 Under this, RJD is proposed to give seven seats to Congress and 32 seats to Left parties
 jeemem ne vamadalon ko manaane kaa jimmaa congress par chhod diya he
 According to sources, the Congress is adamant on contesting 28 seats in Jharkhand and RJD in 10 seats
 aise main vamadalon ke hisse koi bhi seat milti nahin dikh rahi he
 Whereas, MSS has kept demand for two seats and CPI Male for five seats

 jeemem adivasee siton main se lohardaga, khijri, manika or jagannathpur hi congress ko dena chaahati he
 Whereas, Congress is seeking six seats, including Hhatia, Vishrampur, Madhupur, Ghatshila, Bermo and Gandey seats
 congress apane bade adivasee netaaon ko chunavi maidan main utaarna chaahati he, jiske liye adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit siten maang rahi he
 JMM is in a better position on the remaining tribal reserved seats due to tribal base
 2014 ke chunaav main adivasee arakshit 28 siten main se jeemem 11 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi

 yahi kaaran he ki nilgayon kaa prakope lagaataar badhata ja rahaa he
 'nilgai' is also going on to declare schedule five animals on the lines of the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh in UP

 After the slaughter, the forest department's claim on the corpse of Nilgai will end and the victim will have full rights over the body

 'social worker Kiran Kumari suggests another way

 By doing so, their growing population would be curbed, tigers would get their natural food and the ecological balance would also be maintained

 'she also says,' The government is avoiding hard work and getting the Nilgaias out of control
 yah aatmghaatee or paristhiti kii asantulan paidaa karne vaala kadam he
 The name "cow" saves the reason for the farmers to bear the brunt of the Nilgaias because the cow is associated with its name

 pabala bataate hai ki centre sarkaar ke nae aadesh se pehle rajyon main nilgai ko maarane ko lekar ajeeb niyam the
 For example, in Madhya Pradesh, Nilgai was allowed to be killed in the same field that he had destroyed
 2001 main bharat main isaki sankhya das lakh thi
 Nilgai is present in such a large number throughout the world that the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ranks it as the 'least worrying' wildlife category
 nilgai prabhavit rajyon main isse fasalon ko hone vaale nuksaan ke liye kisaanon ko muaavja bhi miltaa he
 But due to the extremely complicated process of compensation and the amount of compensation being very modest, the farmers did not claim for it
 madhya pradesh ke congressi vidhayak sunderlaal tiwari kehete hai, 'muaavja lene ke niyam avyaavhaarik hai
 In the Neemuch district of Madhya Pradesh, farmers had even gone on hunger strike last year to reduce the amount of compensation due to damage to crops due to Nilgai and complicated process
 jahaan kisaanon kaa maananaa he ki nilgai unke ilaakon main ghuspaith kar rahi he, vahiin peta kaa mat kuch or he
 Peta India Director of Veterinary Affairs Dr
 manilaal veliyat kehete hai, 'agar ham dekh rahe hai ki nilgai insaani aabaadi ke bich aa rahi he to uski vajah yah he ki logon ne unke ilaakon main atikaraman kar rakhaa he
 If you want to avoid them, then it is important that they are provided with a natural place

 Second- The pairing of Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra in production direction
 teesri or sabase ahm charchaa kii vajah khud sanjay dutt hai
 These 7 characters are important in the life of 'sanju', know who is playing Rolesanjay Dutt's own life is full of ups and downs and controversies that has become a natural excitement among film fans about "sanju"
 film main ranbir kapur ne sanjay dutt kii mukhya bhoomika nibhaai he
 Everyone associated with film production is also praising Ranbir's passion for Sanju
 haalanki ummid se zyada darshak "sanju" ko ranbir kapur ke liye nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 Due to Ranbir, the number of "sanju" viewers is very less
 "aaj tak movie masala"ne apane soshal pej par ek pole kiya
 In this, the opinion of the people was known as to what does one want to see "sanju"? Based on the answer that we got, it seemed that the real hero of Rajkumar's film "sanju" - "sanjay Dutt"
 hamane aaj tak movie masala ke twitor handle par poocha tha - "aap sanjay dutt kii film 'sanju' kisalie dekhnaa chaahate hai?' pole main jawaab ke liye hamane teen opshan die the

 But in the question that we had asked, only 23% percent people found such people who want to see Sanju because of Ranbir
 jabaki nai film dekhne kii aadat se sanju dekhne jane waalon kii sankhya 19 % rahi
 For Sanju, the debate on ranbir-ranveer, Vidhu Vinod Chopra said - i was crazy to say that apart from Ranbir Kapoor in the film - stars like Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Vicky Kaushal will also be seen in the film

 But now the Election Commission has to decide whether these 21 mlas are in the office of profit or not
 is maamle kii do baar sunwaayee hui jisamen congress, bijepi or dilli sarkaar ne ayog ko bataaya ki aakhir kyon unako is maamle main party banaaya janaa chahie
 But the Commission rejected the demand of these three, so that the petitioner and 21 mlas will now be face to face
 aap vidhayakon ko aaj ayog ko samajhaana hoga ki aakhir kaise unki sansadeey sachiv ke pad hui niyukti laabh ke pad ke daayre main nahin aati or kyon unki vidhayaki radd na kii jaae
 However, the difficulties of AAP legislators have already increased as the President has already returned the bill through which the Delhi government was trying to lift the post of 21 parliamentary secretary out of the purview of profit
 lekin ab chunaav ayog ko tay karnaa he ki yah 21 vidhayak laabh ke pad par hai yaa nahin

 The actor says that in the Marathi trailer of the film, Bal thackeray-turned-nawazuddin is seen saying "saale andu-gundu" to the people of South India
 wo ye bhi kehete hai ki Uthao lungi, bajao pungi
 Let us tell you that in the beginning of his politics, Bal Thackeray had launched a movement against South Indians in Mumbai regarding the Marathi manoos

 The six issues on which there are serious differences between the government and the Hazare side are to keep the corrupt conduct of mps within the Prime Minister, the High Judiciary and Parliament within the ambit of this independent investigating body, giving the Lokpal the authority to decide its budget, the cbi's Inclusion of the anti-corruption Branch in the Lokpal and through a single law, establish Lokayukta in the states along with the Lokpal at the Center
 in chah muddon ke alaava kal kii baithak main lokapal ke chayan or use hataane kii prakriya ke do naye muddon par bhi donon pakshon ke bich matbhed ubhare
 The Jan Lokpal bill of the Hazare side says that the Lokpal should be completely independent and not under government at all
 hazaare paksh ne apane masaude main pradhanmantri, ucch nyaaypalika or sansad ke bheetar saansadon ke aacharan ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke praavdhaan bataaye hai
 The draft members of the society said that a bench of the first seven members would look into the complaint of corruption against the Prime Minister and judges of the High Judiciary and recommend an inquiry only if the complaint was found appropriate
 hazaare paksh kaa kahana he ki lokapal ko puri tarah vittiya swaittata ho
 The government claims that the Hazare side has mentioned in its draft a provision to allocate one per cent budget of GDP to the Lokpal
 sarkaar kaa masauda kahata he ki lokapal kisi bhi naukarshah ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikaayat milane par pehle uske paksh ko sunegaa or phir praathmik jaanch shuru karegaa
 The Hazare party is against this provision
 hazaare paksh kaa masauda kahata he ki paanch nyaayadhishon kii ek chaanbin samiti lokapal ke pramukh pad ke liye chayan samiti ko naam sujhaaye or chayan samiti main pradhanmantri, vipaksh ke netaa, ucchtam nyaayalay ke do nyaayadhish, ucch nyaayalayon ke do mukhya nyaayadhish, mukhya chunaav ayukta or niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak ko rakhaa jaae
 According to the Jan Lokpal Bill of the members of the society, the anti-corruption Branch of the CBI should be included in the Lokpal and the Lokpal should be empowered to investigate the corruption of subordinate bureaucrats at the level of Joint Secretary

 jab bhi dilli main behatar kaam hota he to ye ek nai jaanch lagava dete hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party's government cannot do a good job, so they put their parrots

 At the same time, Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashish Khaitan also came out in support of Satyendra Jain and said that whenever the Kejriwal government works in the public interest, the CBI or other agency will file a case

 lakshmi nagar main rahane vaale alok singh or mamata singh apane 2 maheene ke bachche ko ghar se baahar nikaalane main bhi darate hai
 According to Alok Singh, the increasing pollution of Delhi has also affected the health of his child
 yahi vajah he ki alok apane bachche kii sehat ko lekar hameshaa phikrmand rahete hai
 Of course, there is no greater happiness for any parent than their children
 lekin yah baccha agar dilli main janma he to us par pehle din se hi pradooshan kaa waar shuru ho jaataa he
 We are not saying dangerous environmental consequences, but a UNICEF report says
 unicef kii haalia report main bacchon par pradooshan ke asar ko lekar chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye gaye hai
 According to the report, air pollution affects not only the physical health of children, but also mental health
 pradooshan se bacchon ke dimag ko hone vaala nuksaan itnaa bada or gaharaa hota he ki iskaa asar lambey samay tak rahata he
 Polluted air does not allow the brain to develop
 Actually, the ultra fine particles present in the polluted air are so small that it is easily absorbed into the blood and starts to attack the blood brain barrier protecting it from poisonous particles in the brain
 unicef kii report ke anusaar vahiin ultra fine magnetic agar sharir main pahunch jaaen to oxidative stress ho saktaa he, jo aage chalakar neurodigenerative bimariyon kaa kaaran banataa he
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can damage the parts of the brain that help to communicate with neurons, as well as the parts of the brain through which a child learns and develops
 1 se 5 saal ke bacchon par zyada asaradrasal, bachche ke paidaa hone se lekar paanch saal tak kii umr tak uskaa immune system or fefde viksit hone kii prakriya main hote hai
 So when the child breathes at this age, then at that time he breathes more according to his body weight than the elders
 agar baccha ye saans pradooshit hawa main le rahaa he, jo ki dilli main zyaadaatar maukon par pradooshit hi hoti he, to phir hawa main maujuud chemicals sidhe uske dimag par atake karte hai
 Which chemicals are present in polluted air also tell you which toxic chemicals are present in air pollution
 in rasayanon kaa bacchon kii sehat par kaise asar hota he
 Pollution consists of three types of particles
 pehla ultra fine polution particals, doosraa ultra fine magnetic or teesraa policyclic arometic hydro carbons
 In the past, when the level of pollution was increased, these three parties attacked your children and when these poisonous particles present in the pollution attack, then the result is very bad
 PM 2
 5 How does PM 2, according to Dr
 Ravi Malik, your cancer specialist? 5 jaise prudashan ke kan itane chote or baarik hote hai ki wo hawa ke jariye bacchon ke sharir ke andar pahunchate hai
 After reaching the body, they reach the brain through blood, from where they attack the blood brain barrier
 bachche ke dimag main ek patali si jhilli hoti he, jo dimag ko jahrile padaarthon se bachaati he
 Delhi's air has been the most polluted for many years, especially during winter
 lihaaja dilli main paidaa hone vaale or yahaan rahane vaale bacchon ke dimag par pradooshan kaa sabase zyada atake hota he
 Children have this problem due to pollution
 Child neurologist Dr
 Praveen Kumar told Aaj Tak that due to continuous exposure to pollution, there is a direct effect on the growing brain of children
 isaki vajah se bachche kii seekhney samajhane kii kshamta, ekaagratha or yaaddaasht par asar pad rahaa he
 Pollution particles such as lead, sulfur, nitrous oxide, ozone all damage the blood barrier membrane protecting the brain
 bacchon ke dimag kaa 90 pratishat vikaas 2 saal kii umr tak ho jaataa hai
 But the remaining 10 percent of the brain develops from the age of 10 to 12, which can lead to further memory problems in children, such as les IQ, due to exposure to pollution
 unicef kii report ke mutabik pradooshan ke kan brain ke white matter, jo ki bacchon ko seekhney samajhane main madadgaar hota hai, use bhi lagaataar damege kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, this problem is more than everywhere in urban or metro areas
 is baat kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa hai ki hamaara paryaavaran hi iske liye jimmedaar he
 Last November in Delhi, PM2 between seven days i
e
 7 November to 13 November
 5 or piem 10 donon sivir category main the or maujuuda vakt yani disambar ke puure shuruaati hafte main bhi vaayu pradooshan lagaataar Very Poor category main bana hua he
 In direct words, during this period, the poisonous air attacked the children's brains the most
 kul milakar ye kaha ja saktaa he ki agar vakt rahete pradooshit hawaaon kaa koi ilaaj nahin kiya gaya, to phir in jahrili hawaaon main saans lene vaale bachche naa to kabhi vaigyanik ban paaenge or naa hi khelon kii duniya main hindustan kaa naam raushan kar sakenge

 australia ke ol rounder shen watson ko team se baahar hone kaa koi malaal nahin he
 He is not upset even after being ignored for the ODI series with India
 34 saal ke watson ne philhal apana dhyaan big bash lig main lagaaya he, lekin man main dar baith chukaa he
 Watson retired from Test cricket last year

 i can still play, but now it is in the hands of the selectors whether they choose me or not
 ' Whatever Watson says, no one can turn his back on the truth
 big bash main unke maujuuda pradarshan ko dekhen to tasviir apane-aap saaf ho jaati he
 Watson, who has played 49 T20s for Australia, has scored just 94 runs in 6 matches of the league, not including a single half-century
 gendbaaji main bhi wo kuch kamaal nahin kar sake hai
 He has 5 wickets in these 6 matches
 watson ne pichley saal test cricket ko alavida kah diya
 Watson decided to retire after coach Darren Lehmann dropped him from the team after a poor performance in the first Test of the Ashes series last year
 watson ne 59 test main 3731 ran banane ke baad sanyas liya
 According to the Australian media, Watson has given up hope of a comeback and is focusing on the Big Bash League

 It is important for me to perform well for the team i am playing on behalf of

 In his 11-year international career, Watson has scored 5757 runs in odis
 is dauraan un par kai baar sawaal uthe, lekin unhone apane pradarshan se jawaab diya he

 Bigg Boss 13 has created history in the case of TRP
 sho ke itihaas main sijan 13 sabase safal sijan sabit hua he
 Enthusiasm about the show is clearly visible in the audience
 haalanki, shuruyaat main big bos tiarapy ke maamle main zyada acha nahin kar rahaa tha, lekin sho main mekars dwaara laae gaye interesting twists and terns, contestants ke bich ke hivoltage drame, ladaai-jhagadon or khatti mithi nok-jhonk ne sho ko hit bana diya he
 Given the increasing TRP and demand of the show, the makers have extended season 13
 ab big bos kaa grand sho janvari nahin balki farvari tak chalegaa
 But where fans are happy with the expansion of Bigg Boss, there is another question in the mind of the audience, how much it is right to extend the show and whether the show's TRP will be increased after the extension or on the expectations of the makers Will the water reverberate? Let us tell you about the aspects that can make the show flop after the extension? Salman Khan's absence on the show - Bollywood's Dabangg ie Salman Khanbig's boss
 big bos ko deshbhar main salmaan khan ke chehre se hi janaa jaataa he
 Salman Khan's big fan following plays an important role in increasing the TRP of the show
 lekin aisi khabaren aa rahi hai ki actension ke baad shaayad salmaan khan sho ko host nahin karenge
 Fans are disappointed on social media as soon as news of Salman Khan not hosting Bigg Boss comes out
 soshal media par salmaan khan ke kai phans ne bolaa ki agar salmaan khan sho host nahin karenge to wo sho dekhnaa hi chhod denge
 Now it is certain that if Salman Khan leaves the show after the expansion of Bigg Boss, it can have a direct impact on the show's tarp
 celebs main thakaan or lo energy-big bos ek aisa ghar he, jahaan contestants bahari duniya se dur ek hi ghar main alag-alag tarah ke logon ke saath rahete hai
 Contestants become quite irritable by staying away from their loved ones for a long time and living in an environment of daily disputes and fighting
 vahiin, ek samay par contestants kii energy bhi down hone lagati he
 From the very beginning in season 13, there has been a lot of drama and battles between contestants
 ab sawaal yahaan ye uthta he ki sho main darshak ek hi tarah kaa drama, ladaai-jhagade lambey samay dekhakar bor bhi ho sakate hai
 By staying in the house for a long time, the energy of the contestants is also down, the TRP of the show may be affected
 farah khan-aisi khabaren hai ki big bos ke ekstansion ke baad salmaan khan ko farah khan riples kar sakati hai
 This is not the first time that Farah Khan's name is coming in place of Salman Khan
 big bos sijan 13 se pehle sijan 8 main bhi farah khan ne salmaan khan ko riples kiya tha
 Farah Khan hosted the show quite well
 lekin baavjood iske sho kii tiarapy kaaphi gir gai thi
 Now it remains to be seen whether this time the TRP falls or rises after the extension of the show

 Khurana says, when Modi again became the Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2007, i had one of his boards made and hanged at Ramamandi Chowk in Jalandhar
 us par likhaa tha 'future piem of india'
 People told me that i have gone mad, but my opinion about Modi has not changed yet
 mujhe lagata he ki 16 may ko sari sthiti spasht ho jaaegi
 Khurana, who works in bread making, said, 'suddenly this thing came in my heart and i said that Modi will become the Prime Minister
 iske baad maine apane karyaalay ko modi ke mandir ke rup main tabdeel kar diya
 i worship him while opening and closing my office
 pichley saat saal se main har saal unka janmdin manaata aa rahaa hum
 'asked about his long beard, Khurana, 39, says, i have sworn that Modi will not cut his beard until he becomes the Prime Minister

 She had given a letter written with her own blood in seven pages

 Khurana says that on the day Modi becomes Prime Minister, he will get his beard cut
 or har vyakti ko apane stock ke hisaab se ek bread uphaar main denge
 He claims that he predicted Sri Lanka's one-day World Cup win and Atal Bihari Bajpayee to become Prime Minister and that she proved to be accurate
 jab srilanka ke jeetne vaali baat bataai to logon ne mujhe gaaliyaan deen or kaha ki srilanka kaa kahin sthaan nahin he or vah kaise jeet saktaa he
 Khurana has already heard the same ghazal of Pankaj Udhas sixty thousand times in a row

 Later Pankaj came and he closed it

 rajasthan vidhansabha main 5 fisadi gurjar aarakshan kaa bill teesri baar paas ho gaya he
 The Backward Classes Reservation Bill 2019 was introduced in the Vidhan Sabha on Wednesday and was passed today
 is bill main kaha gaya he ki gurjaron ko 5 fisadi aarakshan diya jaataa he
 Along with this, it was also appealed to the Gurjars to leave the railway tracks and highways
 unki maang rajasthan vidhansabha main vidhayak ke rup main paarit kii ja chuki he
 However, it has not been decided yet whether the Gujjars will get up from the railway tracks and highways, as Ashok Gehlot, as the first Chief Minister, gave 5 per cent reservation to the Gujjars in 2015, which was banned by the High Court
 
 uske baad vasundhara sarkaar ai to 2017 main gurjaron ko aarakshan diya gaya
 The Rajasthan High Court also stayed that
 rajasthan sarkaar iske khilaaf supreme court gai he or vahaan par sunwaayee chal rahi he
 It is our government's firm belief that we can liberate our state from the curse of poverty and unemployment only by financially empowering every section of the society - especially the poor, helpless and backward classes

 com / k60t7wveyl — Ashok Gehlot (@ ashokgehlot51) February 13, 2019 No more than 50 percent reservation
 Meanwhile, in 2018, the Congress government came back and Gurjar again got back on track demanding reservation
 ashok gahalot ne samaadhaan kaa vahi tarika nikaala or ek baar phir se 2019 main gurjaron ko aarakshan dene kaa vidhansabha main paarit karvaa diya
 The Gujjars Reservation Bill is passed in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, but gets stuck every time
 court kaa kahana he ki aarakshan kii kul seemaa 50 se zyada nahin ho sakati he, lihaaja gurjaron ko aarakshan nahin diya ja saktaa he
 So far, 49 per cent of Rajasthan already has SC, ST and OBC including 49 per cent reservation
 bachaa hua ek fisadi aarakshan gurjaron ko diya ja rahaa he
 With the passage of the third time, the Gurjars will get the benefit of reservation
 is par bijepi ne ashanka jataate hue kaha ki vidhansabha main sab raji to the, lekin isse kuch ho nahin paaegaa
 Congress appealed to the Modi government to amend the constitution, Leader of the Opposition Gulabchand Kataria said that it has been happening for the last several years, but until the constitution is amended, the Gujjars cannot get reservation
 iskaa jawaab dete hue rajasthan ke up mukhyamantri sachin payalat ne kaha ki bijepi centre kii modi sarkaar se samvidhan sanshodhan karavaaen
 By the way, the Constitution has been amended to provide reservation to the poor
 usee tarah se gurjaron ko aarakshan dene ke liye centre main samvidhan sanshodhan karavaaen
 The whole world saw Gill insulting the master of Dangal's overbearing Sushil Kumar
 magar pad ke gurur main andhe ho chuke khel mantri ne aisa pehali baar nahin kiya tha
 Gill has been discouraging players in the past as well
 susheel ke guru satpal se pehle unhone desh ke yuva parvatarohi arjuna vaajapeyi kaa apmaan kiya tha
 Arjun, who conquered Everest at just 16 years and 11 months, is the youngest Indian to achieve this feat
 everest se lautne ke baad arjuna ne gil se mulaakaat kii thi
 But Gill broke his heart by saying that mountaineering is fond of whites, why does he risk his life

 The ban has been lifted from Tik Tok, but still this app is not available on Google Play Store and Apple App Store
 hafte bhar is ap ko google play store or aipal ke ap store se bain rakhaa gaya tha
 However, you can still download this app
 iske liye aapako third party website kaa sahaara lenaa hoga
 The Madras High Court has lifted the ban from Tik Tok, but has also placed the condition
 court ne kaha he ki is plateform par aise contant aplod nahin hone chahie jo pornography se jude hon or aisi sthiti main 36 ghante ke andar ap ko acshan lenaa hoga
 If the app does not do so, then the proceedings of the court of courts will be initiated
 company kii taraf se court main die gaye tarkon main ek tark ye bhi tha ki Tik Tok ke paas aisi technolji uplabdh he jo ye sunishchit karti he ki koi neude yaa obsin contant is ap par aplod na kiye jaaen
 Not only this, the company has said that more than 60 lakh videos have been removed because they were violating the policy
 Tik Tok pehle Music
 was popularly known as ly, later it became a tick talk
 gauratlab he ki america main bhi is ap par avaidh tareeke se bacchon kii personal information colect karne kaa charge lagaaya gaya tha
 However, this app has set up the case with the US Federal Trade Commission ie FTC 5
 7 million dollar dene kii hami bhari thi
 Tik Tok has 500 million monthly active users worldwide
 lekin ye bhi ek tathy he ki bharat main is ap kaa sabase bada market he or yahaan is ap ke 120 million se zyada manthali active yugers hai
 This is the reason why Tick Talk was losing $ 5 million every day after the app was banned
 mumkin he company nai policy par kaam kar rahi he taaki bhavishya main bain hone se bachaa sake
 This is probably the reason why it has not yet come on Google Play Store and Apple App Store
 haalanki company ne court dwaara bain hataae jane ke baad die ek statement main khushi jaahir karte hue kaha he ki jald hi yah ap downlod ke liye uplabdh hoga, lekin iske liye koi samaysima nahin bataai gai he
 Tik Tok's parent company Byte Dance Approx 69 in India

 The Central Government has amended the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 to make some new rules for the sale of cattle
 is niyam ke tahat pashuon ke liye lagane vaale saptahik melon yaa mandiyon main ab kasaai ke haathon yaa kataai ke liye maweshiyon ko nahin bechaa ja sakegaa
 This includes cow, buffalo, calf, camel
 nae niyam main yah nahin kaha gaya he ki gaay yaa bhens ke kaatane par sampurna roak lagaai ja rahi he balki melon yaa mandiyon se sidhe kharidne par roak kii baat kahi gai he

 By the way do you think the government will open a buffalo school? However, Darshan Singh said that the new rule did not completely ban the harvesting of cattle, but prohibiting the sale of butchers in the mandi would make it difficult for the butcher to buy
 pehle vah ek din main bees-pachchis bhainsen kharid saktaa tha, magar ab itani hi bhainsen kharidne main use ghar-ghar ghoomana hoga or do maheene lag jaaenge
 Traders are also saying that it will be difficult to buy meat directly from farmers for trade
 bhens ko nae niyam se baahar kar dena chahie kyonki bharat 65 deshon ko bif kaa niryaat karata he
 In this cycle, millions of people get temporary jobs
 pashupaalak or kisaan bhi mandiyon main apane pashuon ke daam behatar paata he
 He is able to negotiate
 agar vah nahin bech paaegaa to ab use ayogy bhens ko apane ghar main rakhana hoga yaa gaay kii tarah khule main chhod dena hoga
 Controversy related to this issue does not prevent cruelty as much as it is about keeping the politics of cow and cow meat alive
 isamen har paksh kii sakriyata saraahneey he
 It is not about meat, but after meat, there is the business of leather, there is the business of bones which has connected employment to millions of people

 It should also have been told what kind of bed, a mattress would have to be used while felling the cattle on the ground for falsification
 ab aate hai bif politics par
 The BJP has made a widespread issue across the country on Saturday in the Youth Congress
 ab meghalaya ke bijepi netaaon kii bif or gau maance par pratikriya sun lijie
 It is definitely that he has not done the disgusting act of protest by cutting the calf in public
 meghalaya bijepi ke netaa barnard mara ne kaha he ki agar yah niyam lagu kiye gaye to ve bijepi chhod denge
 If this rule does not change then it will be difficult for us to campaign for BJP in the upcoming elections
 unka kahana he ki ham apane rajya ke khan paan ke vyavhaar ke khilaaf nahin ja sakate hai
 He also said that BJP leaders in Meghalaya eat beef
 march main nagaland ke bijepi chif ne hindustan times se kaha tha ki agar nagaland main hamaari party satta main aati he to upi kii tarah yahaan gaay kaatane par bain nahin lagegaa
 The leaders of our center also know this
 nagaland kii sarkaar main bijepi bhagidaar he
 The BJP president of Mizoram had also said that there would be no ban in Mizoram for cow slaughter
 goa kii bhi yahi haalat he
 So the BJP should also clearly say whether it is in favor of banning beef meat across the country, and what it is going to do for it
 aisa karne se pehle use bataanaa hoga isse jude lakhon logon ke rojgaar kaa vikalp kya he, unka kya hoga
 What will be the impact on the farmers in the villages

 The fine is fine, ranging from ten rupees to 100 rupees only
 yah bhi bataanaa chahie tha ki nalabandi ke liye maveshi ko jameen par giraate vakt kis tarah kii shaiyya yani bistar yani gadde kaa istemaal karnaa hoga
 Now come to beef politics
 shanivaar ko kerala main youth congress kii karatuut ko bijepi ne desh bhar main vyapak mudda bana diya he
 Now listen to the reaction of Meghalaya BJP leaders on beef and beef
 yah zarur he ki unhone public main bachade ko katkar virodh kaa ghinauna kaam nahin kiya he
 Meghalaya BJP leader Bernard Marak has said that if these rules are implemented, he will leave the BJP
 agar yah niyam nahin badla to hamaare liye aagaamee chunaavon main bijepi ke liye prachaar karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 They say that we cannot go against the food and drink behavior of our state
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki meghalaya main bijepi ke netaa bif khate hai
 In March, the Nagaland BJP chief told Hindustan Times that if our party comes to power in Nagaland, there will not be a ban on cow slaughter here like in UP
 yah baat hamaare centre ke netaaon ko maaloom bhi he
 The BJP is a partner in Nagaland's government
 mizoram ke bijepi adhyaksh ne bhi kaha tha ki gaay kaatane par mizoram main koi bain nahin hoga
 Goa also has the same condition
 to bijepi ko bhi saaf-saaf kahana chahie ki kya vah puure desh main gau maance par pratibandh lagane ke paksh main he, or iske liye kya karne ja rahi he
 Before doing this, he has to tell what is the employment option of millions of people associated with it, what will happen to them

 According to a new book, Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler used Viagra to increase sexual power
 is adhyayan ke liye chikitsa abhilekhaagaar main band rahe dastavejon or kuch gopneey sainya dastavejon ko aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 The book claimed that Hitler consumed 82 different types of drugs, including "viagra"
 yah viagara testosterone se nikaala gaya ek prakaar kaa sat tha
 The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that the book "was Hitler's Eye" stated that Hitler believed that the sexual enhancer would give him the energy needed to have a relationship with his younger girlfriend Eva Brown
 kitaab main likhi gai baaten hitler ke nijee chikitsak theodor morel urf rich syringe ke dastavejon par aadhaarit hai
 The book states that Morel started giving Hitler an injection of testosterone and sperm from the calf's Protest glands in the year 1944
 critish daily kii khabar ke anusaar morel ne parvitin, glucose, methamthetamine kaa enjaction, barbituret, opitate ke alaava kuch anya tatv kii kuch khuraaq bhi hitler ko di thi
 Hitler, who died at the age of 56, believed that the small calf's sperm and his Protestant glands conferred sexual power in establishing a relationship with his 33-year-old girlfriend, Brown
 berlin ke bunker main hitler ke saath hi ek nai naveli dulhan ke rup main brown ne bhi april 1945 main synide khaakar jaan de di
 According to the doctor's records, Hitler became very afraid of his health when he became ill, and a condition came that he started taking 28 different medicines for its treatment

 Abrell and Newman eventually concluded that Hitler was suffering from Parkinson's disease
 vah bhram rog se grasit nahin tha
 He was fully conscious and responsible for the action he took
 hitler ko lekar anya baaten jo saamne ai usase pataa chalata he ki hitler ko cancer se marane kaa dar tha
 He suffered from high blood pressure, cramps and headaches
 aaj se pehle shaayad aapane kisi train kaa naam badalte nahin suna hoga
 Especially when it has been running on the track for a long time and the train is part of the important announcement by the Railway Minister, but after the court order, the amritsar-lalkuan Express has now been named Garib Rath Express
 is train kaa naam badalane kii kahani bahut dilachasp he
 Actually, this train was announced by Pawan Kumar Bansal in the Railway Budget of 2013–14
 aam aadmi kii pahunch se dur phuli asi coach
 Neither the Sleeper Bogee nor General Bogey were involved in this

 The railway continued to defame the public here
 lekin uttarakhand ke keshav paasi ko kahani samaj main aa gai or unhone nainital hoicourt main cese daayar kar diya
 In this case, the court ruled on June 10 that the name of amritsar-lalkuan Express should be immediately changed to Garib Rath Express and as a result, on 11 June, the railway website changed the name of this train
 haalanki court ke is aadesh ke baad ab bhi kai sawaal baaki hai
 The new fare will be of the poor chariot, but so far, how will the passengers from whom the Railways charge more money be accounted for
 kya railway unako paise lautaaegi? agar nahin to phir un paison kaa kya hoga or agar haa to phir un yatriyon kii talash kaise hogi

 He said that the government is trying to postpone the discussion on the issue of inflation under the adjournment motion and Rule 168
 sarkaar chaahati he ki dhyanaksharn prastaav ke jariye is mudde par charchaa ho lekin party apane rukh se peeche nahin hategi

 It is up to the government whether or not to accept the recommendations of the parliamentary committee, but according to social workers campaigning against smoking, not implementing the warning as per deadline is not a good sign

 behatar hoga nivesh ke liye maahaulayah reating jitani behatar hogi,nivesh karneke liye desh main maahaul utana hi behatar hoga
 The risk of investing in long-term bonds will be lower

 Foreign investment in India is also expected to increase with Moody's rating improving
 mudies ne kaha he ki reating main sudhaar kaa phayda iconomi ko milegaa
 Domestic investors can also increase their investment

 The Congress-led government found itself trapped in a quagmire of scams one after another

 Targeting Singh separately, he alleged that the Prime Minister not only ran away from his responsibility but also gave him a silent acceptance of the whole incident by keeping a conscientious silence while the country expected him to provide honest and transparent leadership

 a surprising incident has come to light in Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital
 aspataal ke immergency oparation theatre ke pehle istemaal ko lekar kuch doctoron main ladaai ho gai
 Actually a doctor wanted to do an emergency operation of his patient
 usee samay ek mahila kaa delivery cese aayaa, jisko tatkaal oti main bhejnaa jaruri tha
 In such a situation, a fight started between the Department of Gynecology and Surgery to make the emergency process first
 aspataal ke saajhe immergency oparation theatre main ianti, pediatric, gincology or plastic surgery vibhaag ke immergency oparation kiye jate hai
 It is on the first floor of the Old Emergency Building of the OT Hospital
 ise nai imaarat main shift karne kaa plan he, lekin abhi tak aisa sambhav nahin ho paaya he
 a senior doctor at the hospital told Mail Today on the condition of anonymity, 'surgery and delivery cases are important to us
 lekin is ghatana ne itnaa naatakeey rup le liya ki hamaare saamne ek boul gangarine se peedit marij tha, to duusari taraf, ekadelivery kesabhi tha

 hamaare liye to donon hi cese mahatvapurn the, lekin hameshaa praathamikta garbhvatee mahila ko di jaati he, kyonki vah lebar pen kaa saamana kar rahi hoti he
 'another doctor said,' OT is used for five different types of specialties
 aise kai udhaaharan aae hai, jab ham doctor apane marij ko pehle oparate karne ke liye ek-duusare se ulajh pade
 The wrong thing in this is that some cases of gynecology are made emergency

 dhara 370 ke antargat raashtrapati ke aadesh se 1954 main lagu kii gai samvidhan kii dhara 35e centre sarkaar ke liye ab mushkilon kaa sabab ban gai he
 In the case, the RSS think tank Jammu and Kashmir Vichar Manch has increased the pressure on the central government to reject Artikil 35A forever
 idhar supreme court ne ve da pipul or west paak rifuji ection cameti-1947 samet 5 anya kii yachika par sunwaayee ke liye agali taarikh 21 oktober tay kar di he
 The date of the first hearing was set for September 13 by the Supreme Court
 centre sarkaar ko is bich supreme court main ye jawaab bhi daakhil karnaa he ki aakhir sanvaidhanik taur par bagaiyr sansad kii manjuuri ke sirf raashtrapati ke aadesh se 1954 main paarit dhara 35e kii maujuuda sanvaidhanik haisiyat kya he? maamle main mudda ye bhi he ki aakhir kyon samvidhan kii kisi nai prakashit pustak main iskaa zikr nahin aata? jabaki puraane samvidhan kii pratiyon main bhi dhara 35 e ko parishisht main hi rakhaa gaya he
 What is the matter of Section 35A? Article 35A of the Constitution got a place in the Constitution on 14 May 1954 by order of the President
 samvidhan sabha lekar sansad kii kisi bhi kaarywahi main kabhi anuchhed 35e ko samvidhan kaa hissaa banane ke sandarbh main kisi samvidhan sanshodhan yaa bill laane kaa zikr nahin miltaa
 The then government used the power obtained under Section 370 to implement Article 35A
 anuchhed 35e se jammu-kashmir sarkaar or vahaan kii vidhansabha ko sthaayee nivasee kii paribhaasha tay karne kaa manamaana adhikaar mil gaya
 At the same time, the state government also got the right to give or not to provide any kind of facilities to the refugees and other Indian citizens who came from other places in Jammu and Kashmir at the time of independence
 dhara 35e ko lekar vivaad kyon?desh ke vibhaajan ke vakt badi taadaad main pakistan se sharnaarthi bharat aae
 Among them, lakhs of refugees are also living in the state of Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne anuchhed 35e ke jariye in sabhi bhartiya nagarikon ko jammu-kashmir ke sthaayee nivasee praaanpatr se vanchit kar diya
 80 per cent of these deprived people belong to the backward and Dalit Hindu community
 isi ke saath jammu-kashmir main vivaah kar basane vaali mahilaon or anya bhartiya nagarikon ke saath bhi jammu-kashmir sarkaar anuchhed 35e kii aad lekar bhedbhaav karti he
 In the petition filed in the Supreme Court, people have complained that due to Article 35A, their fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution have been taken away in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, so the Central Government should immediately repeal this clause applicable by order of the President
 kya he maujuuda jammu-kashmir sarkaar kaa rukh?jammu-kashmir sarkaar kii ore se supreme court main jawaab daakhil kiya ja chukaa he
 The Jammu government has claimed in the Supreme Court that the President's order has been challenged in the court for the first time since the passage of Article 35A in 1954
 is tarah se yachika prastut karne main deree kii gai
 On this basis, this petition should be dismissed
 vaise yachika main uthaae gaye mudde ko supreme court ne puranlal or sanpat prakaash ke cese main pehle hi khaarij kar diya he lihaaja ab is yachika kaa koi matlab nahin banataa he
 
 
 
 anuchhed 35e ab nirnit kanoon ban chukaa he, rajya sarkaar or centre ne ise manjuuri de rakhi he
 What is the attitude of RSS? To eliminate Article 35A, the RSS think tank Jammu and Kashmir Vichar Manch has waged a logical and intellectual fight from the court to the street
 ajtak se baatcheet main jammu-kashmir vichaar manch ke sanyojak ashutosh bhatnagar kaa kahana he ki ‘centre sarkaar ko aaj nahin to kal anuchhed 35e par stand saaf karnaa padegaa, aakhir kab tak bagaiyr sansad kii manjuuri ke anuchhed 35e raashtrapati ke aadesh maatr se desh ke lakhon nagarikon ke saath khuleam bhedbhaav kaa sabab banegi
 Will soon clarify its stand Another central leader associated with RSS says that we have spoken to the people associated with the government in the matter and made it clear that the government should take a stand in the matter as per the basic spirit of the Constitution
 jammu-kashmir main lakhon bhartiya nagarikon ke saath aakhir kab tak is tarah bhedbhaav chalata rahegaa
 The central government has assured us that the government will not allow any Indian citizen to be discriminated against in Jammu and Kashmir and the government will also scrutinize its stand in front of the court after thorough review of the 1954 President's order regarding Article 35A

 If the doctor was not there, then the sanitation worker of the hospital became a doctor
 barason tak aspataal or oparation theatre main usne itani baar safai kii ki bas doctoron ko oparesh karte dekh-dekh kar wo doctor ban gaya
 And then as soon as i got a chance, i tried all the herbs in the doctor
 na doctor kaa intjaar, na bijli kii phikrasadak haadase main ek mahila ghayal ho gai thi
 There were deep injuries on his hands
 ghar vaale use bhaage-bhaage lekar sadar aspataal pahunche
 But coincidentally, the doctors, nurses and electricity trio were missing and dead in the hospital
 mauka badhiya tha
 To clean his hands and try his doctor's skills
 lihaaza bina mauka ganvaae sweepar kii vardi main hi is safai karchamaari ne haathon main gloves pahana or surgery shuru kar di
 Neither the doctor waited nor the electricity came
 torch kii roshni main opareshtub bijli to thi nahin, to oprashan kaise hota? lihaaza maukey par maujuud ghayal mahila kii chaar rishtedaaron main se ek ne torch pakad lee
 The second lit the mobile's flash light, the third caught the hand of the injured woman to help the doctor suddenly become a doctor from the swiper
 bachi chauthi to wo apni ghayal mahila rishtedaar ko dilasa dene main lag gai
 Live recording of the operationnow treatment begins
 pehle haath ke kate hisse ko saaf kiya jaataa he
 Then the work of soldering with needle starts
 or taanke ke aakhir main dhaage main ganth baandh kar use kaat diya jaataa he
 This entire operation was also being done live record
 magar safai karmchaaree ko isaki ratti bhar parvaah nahin thi
 Perhaps he was addicted to it earlier

 Shambhu Malik, the name of these men who are operating in a khaki uniform, works as a cleaning worker in this hospital
 ab ek safai karmchaaree is tarah doctor ban kar oparation karne lage to aspataal ke doctoron se sawaal to banataa hi he
 But when he tried to talk to the hospital's civil surgeon about this, he cut off the kanni by saying that he is currently in Patna
 ab baari aspataal ke dipti suparitendent se yahi sawaal poochne kii thi
 So they also put the cap on someone else's head

 Operations have been done here in the dark even before
 ab zaahir he jab oparation andhere main honge to phir kisko dikhaai dene ja rahaa he ki oparation karne vaale doctor hai, swipper yaa phir or koi auki? vaaki andhergardi he
 The triple talaq bill was discussed in the Lok Sabha on Thursday

 Meanwhile, when BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi spoke, she said that while listening to everyone's talk, suddenly Jawaharlal Nehru was remembered
 minakshi lekhi ne is dauraan ek kissa sunaaya
 The BJP leader said that French journalist Andre Malroux had ever asked Jawaharlal Nehru what was the biggest problem you faced in independent India
 jiske jawaab main nehru ne kaha tha ki sabase badi mushkil thi kanoon ke hisaab se rajya kii sthapana karnaa
 Apart from this, Jawaharlal Nehru had said that with this, creating a secular state (rule) in a religious country
 minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki kya aaj narendra modi ke saamne aisi hi mushkilen nahin hai
 Even today, similar disputes are being raised that people are saying that religion is in trouble
 unhone kaha ki tab hindu code bill tha or ab teen talaak bill he
 Meenakshi Lekhi said that because of the Hindu Code bill b

 hindu code bill ko laane main khud jawahar laal nehru ne badi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The BJP MP said in the meantime that everyone has the right to divorce, i will talk about the mistake of the Hindu Mahasabha and also stop the wrong practice of Muslims
 minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki PM modi desh ke pradhanmantri hone kaa haq adaa kar rahe hai jo jawahar laal nehru ke baad rajeev gandhi ne nahin adaa kiya tha
 The opposition believes that Hindu PM Modi cannot be the brother of Muslim women
 unhone kaha ki rajya sarkaar apane sansadhano se jo karjamaafee kar rahi he usase kisaanon kii pareshaani dur nahin hui he
 The government is spending more money on the distribution related events than the amount being given as loan waiver

 HSSC chance to get jobs for 8th, 10th pass: 1000 jobs for 7200 vacancy 10th, 12th pass in police department anbhavi tej gendbaaj ashish nehra ne ‘dabaav bhare halaat’ se nipatane main mahendra singh dhoni ko sarvshereshth bhartiya captain bataaya he
 He said that he regrets that this captain could not give a positive answer to the question of Test return in 2009
 nehra ko isse 17 se zyada test match khilne main madad mil sakati thi
 Dhoni is the best in terms of performance under pressure
 Neehra, who is 37 years old, made a great comeback in the shorter format
 vishwa tii20 main unke behtareen pradarshan se vah ‘team aaf toornament’ main apana chayan karaane main safal rahe
 He said that i played with many captains after my debut under Mohammad Azharuddin in 1999, but Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the best when it comes to performing 'cool' and under pressure
 dabaav main kool rahete hai captain dhoninehara ne kaha ki main ne koi aisa khilaadi nahin dekha jo dabaav main itnaa kool rahata ho
 Nehra's biggest regret is that he could not play more than 17 Test matches
 senior tej gendbaaj ne kaha ki saal 2009 main dhoni or tab coach gairi karston ne mujhase poocha ki kya main test main vaapasi karnaa chaahunga?khelnaa chahie tha zyada test machanehara ne kahaaki main tab 30 yaa 31 saal kaa tha or mujhe sakaaratmak jawaab dena chahie tha lekin main nishchit nahin tha
 Two years ago, at the age of 35, i played six four-day matches in six weeks
 isliye jab main palatakar dekhtaa hum to mujhe lagata he ki mujhe 17 test match se zyada khilne chahie the
 Dada and we were quite senior, Nehra has performed his best under the captaincy of Youngdhoni and Sourav Ganguly
 inke bich tulana ke sawaal par is tej gendbaaj ne kaha ki jab ham saurav kii captaini main khele to main, yuvaraj, virendra sahvaag or jahir khan bahut yuva the
 Saurav's wish was our command
 kyonki unke paas hamase zyada anubhav tha
 If Dada said that something needs to be done then we knew that it had to be completed
 dhoni kii captaini main adhik majounhone kaha ki jab maine 2009 main dhoni kii captaini main vaapasi kii to main or adhik paripakv tha or main apni gendbaaji ke bare main zyada jaanane laga tha
 Hence, Dhoni's captaincy experience was quite enjoyable
 yah poochne par ki ‘captain kool’ aalochana par kaaphi tunak jate hai to nehra ne apane captain kaa bachaav kiya
 Dhoni was angry at the media, Dhoni lost his temper on a question after the Indian team won against Bangladesh
 unhone bhartiya media par vyangy ksaa tha jabaki vishwa tii20 main westeindies ke khilaaf semifinal match ganvaane ke baad austrailian patrkaar ko apane kareeb baithne ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 Your answer depends on the question, how many times have you seen Dhoni losing his temper
 aap kis tarah se vishesh sawaal poochhate ho, yah bhi nirbhar karata he
 Personally speaking, what is written in the newspaper does not matter to me because i do not read it nor watch TV
 main tivi par cricket bhi nahin dekhtaa
 i rarely give statements for interviews or media
 ipel-7 ke final main priti jinta kii team kings ilevan punjab or shahrukh khan kii team kolkata nite rides pahunch gai he
 Kings XI Punjab showed their strength from the very beginning in this season, while kkr's graph sometimes went up or fell down
 ek najar daalate hai donon tiimon ke final tak ke safar parkings ilevan punjab:ipel-6 tak chennai superkings, royal chalangers bengalore, kolkata nite rides or rajasthan royles jaisi tiimon ne paracham laharaaya or jamkar tarif bhi batori lekin punjab ke hisse bas aalochana hi ai thi
 It has been said that Punjab has talent but not the power to win big matches
 18 april ko abu dhabi se lekar 30 may ko mumbai ke vankhede stadium tak, is baar punjab kii team ne ipel main dhooma machaa di he
 While Punjab won 5 consecutive matches, it also remained number one in the points table
 jo team chennai jaisi team ko ek-do nahin balki teen baar ghutane techne par majaboor kar de, uske iraadon ke bare main khud hi andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This time no one has been able to stand before the storm of Punjab
 maxwell or miller kii dhamaakedaar jodi ne gendbaajon ke chakke chhudaae, to sandip sharma or mishael johnson kii dhar or raftaar ke aage bhi virodhiyon ne samarpan kar diya
 After losing the first qualifier when a do or die match with Chennai to reach the finals, who thought that Virender Sehwag's bat would fire again? That is, it is no longer impossible for this Punjab team, which is just a step away from winning the IPL for the first time
 kolkata nite rides:ipel-7 main keker kii shuruyaat bahut kharaab thi, lekin sanbhalee to joardaar pradarshan kiya
 If Robin Uthappa's bat is on fire, then captain Gautam Gambhir has also become serious
 yusuf pathan puraane form main laut aae hai
 Will it be seen that the series of eight consecutive victories will stop or will it continue? For KKR, making it to the finals for the second time in 3 years is like a dream come true
 is baar lig daur main keker kii haalat patali thi
 Kolkata got only 2 wins in the first 7 matches and all hopes of a place in the qualifying round seemed to be shattering
 captain gambhir naa sirf balle naakaam sabit ho rahe the balki unki leadership par bhi sawalia nishaan lagane laga tha
 But after the first round of IPL ended in UAE, India reached kkr's fortunes
 ladi lack se chamaki gambhir kii kismat
 
 
 Soon after coming to India, another 'lady luck' stepped into Gambhir's life
 1 may ko gambhir kii patni natasha ne beti ko janm diya or uske baad gambhir ke saath keker ke bhi achche din aa gaye, haalanki bharat main bhi pehle do match main keker ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 But the process of victory that started after that has continued unabated ever since
 uske baad keker apni team ke mantra 'korbo lodabo jitabo re' ke naare ko amali jama kuch is kadar pahanaaya ki lig daur main lagaataar saat jeet darj kar point teble main punjab ke baad number 2 team ban gai
 KKR registered an eighth consecutive win after defeating Punjab in Qualifier-1 and now KKR are just one step away from becoming champions for the second time
 jab punjab ke khilaaf match chal hi rahaa tha is bich gambhir ke liye ek or badi khushkhabari ai lambey arase baad salectors ne gambhir ko team india main jagah di or wo england daure ke liye test team main shaamil kar liye gaye hai
 These gifts of happiness have brought kkr's courage to the sky

 Amidst the prospect of Mamata Banerjee's populist rail budget being introduced ahead of the impending assembly elections in 2011 in West Bengal, the mps have demanded effective implementation of old projects and taking care of the needs of the entire country

 jangalon ke kataav ke badale khaali zamin par ped lagane or vanya jivan ko bachaane ke liye laaye ja rahe campa kanoon par sarkaar ne congress ke saath kaaphi had tak talmail kar liya he
 The bill could not be discussed in Parliament on Thursday due to the debate on atrocities on Dalits in Gujarat and now it will be passed on Monday
 campa bill loksabhaa se paas ho chukaa he or sarkaar ise jald se jald rajyasabha se paas karana chaahati he
 Now it seems that this law will be passed soon but there are still questions about many aspects of this law

 Companies deposit money in the Compensatory Afforestation Fund as compensation for the use of forest land
 jiske liye Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority yaa campa banaai ja rahi he
 Under the law, the government will give Consta status to Campa which will look after the use of the fund
 sieef fund kaa 90 pratishat rajyon ko auki 10 pratishat centre ke paas rahegaa
 The fund will be used for planting new forests and settling wildlife, improving the forest ecosystem and building infrastructure
 lekin jaankaron ko is bill par shankaaen bhi hai
 40 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the Campa Fund so far
 zaahir he itani badi rakam se bade badlaav kiye ja sakate hai lekin 2013 main ai sieji report main jis tarah campa fund ke durupyog kii khabaren ain use lekar jaankaar naye bill main kai praavdhaanon kii kami kaa zikr kar rahe hai
 Especially with the use of the term infrastructure development
 paryaavaran niyamon ke jaankaar or vakil ruthvik datta kehete hai, ‘sieji kii us report main campa fund kaa adhiktar hissaa adhikariyon ke videshi dauron par kharch hua, asi lagane main kharch hua, tiles lagaakar bathroom ko chamakaane main kharch hua lekin jangal kii vahi haalat he jo pehle thi
 Therefore, when the term Infrastructure Development is being used in the bill, its definition is not mentioned anywhere
 koi nahin jaanata ki is infrastracchar ke naam par kya hoga?’ There is no provision for participation of gram sabhas in the use of funds, while according to the Forest Rights Act, consent of gram sabhas is required
 congress kaa kahana he ki ye kanoon van adhikaar kanoon kaa ulanghan karata he
 Senior Congress leader and former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh had earlier written a letter to Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar regarding this provision, in which it was asked to amend the law
 ramesh kaa virodh adivaasiyon ke van adhikaron ko lekar tha
 On Wednesday, Congress President Sonia Gandhi also said in her party meeting that the government is violating the rights of tribals
 congress ne bill main ek sanshodhan kaa prastaav rakhaa he lekin uske paas abhi left auki jediu jaisi partiyon kaa hi samarthan he jo paryaapt nahin hoga
 The comments sipiai ke netaa di raja ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki sawaal sirf jangalon ko lagane or bachaane kaa nahin he balki ye bhi he ki fund ke istemaal main gramsabhaaon kii kya bhoomika hogi
 Therefore modification is necessary
 sutron ke mutabik paryaapt samarthan na hone par congress apane sanshodhan par voting nahin karaayegi
 On the other hand, the government has assured the opposition that it will include the role of Gram Sabha in the executive rules regarding CAF funds

 90 percent of the CAF fund will be with the states and 10 percent with the center
 fund kaa istemaal naye jangal lagane or vanya jeevon ko basaane, forest echosystem ko sudhaarney ke alaava infrastracchar banane ke liye hoga
 But experts also have doubts on this bill
 campa fund main ab tak 40 hazaar karod rupaya jamaa ho chukaa he
 It is obvious that big changes can be made with such a huge amount, but the way the reports of misuse of Campa Fund came out in the 2013 CAG report, the experts are referring to the lack of many provisions in the new bill
 khaas taur se infrastracchar devlepment shabd ke istemaal ko lekar
 Ritwik Dutta, an expert on environmental regulations and a lawyer, says, "in that CAG report, most of the Campa fund was spent on foreign tours of the officials, spent in installing AC, polishing the bathroom by installing tiles but the condition of the forest is the same Which was earlier
 isaliye bill main jab infrastrachar deveopment shabd istemaal kiya ja rahaa he to uski paribhaasha kahin par nahin bataai gai he
 Nobody knows what will happen in the name of this infrastructure? ' fund ke istemaal main gramsabhaaon kii bhagidaari ko lekar koi praavdhaan nahin he jabaki van adhikaar kanoon ke mutabik gramsabhaaon kii sahmati lenaa zaruri he
 Congress says that this law violates the Forest Rights Act
 congress ke varisht netaa or purv paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne is praavdhaan ko lekar pehle paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ko chitthee likhi thi jisamen kanoon main sanshodhan karne kii baat kahi
 Ramesh was opposed to the forest rights of the tribals
 buudhvaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bhi apni party kii baithak main kaha ki sarkaar adivaasiyon ke adhikaron kaa hanan kar rahi he
 Congress has proposed an amendment in the bill but it has the support of parties like the Left and JDU which will not be enough
 tippaniyan CPI leader d Raja said on Thursday that the question is not only about planting and protecting forests but also what will be the role of Gram Sabhas in the use of funds

 According to sources, if there is not enough support, Congress will not vote on its amendment

 40 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the Campa Fund so far
 zaahir he itani badi rakam se bade badlaav kiye ja sakate hai lekin 2013 main ai sieji report main jis tarah campa fund ke durupyog kii khabaren ain use lekar jaankaar naye bill main kai praavdhaanon kii kami kaa zikr kar rahe hai
 Especially with the use of the term infrastructure development
 paryaavaran niyamon ke jaankaar or vakil ruthvik datta kehete hai, ‘sieji kii us report main campa fund kaa adhiktar hissaa adhikariyon ke videshi dauron par kharch hua, asi lagane main kharch hua, tiles lagaakar bathroom ko chamakaane main kharch hua lekin jangal kii vahi haalat he jo pehle thi
 Therefore, when the term Infrastructure Development is being used in the bill, its definition is not mentioned anywhere
 koi nahin jaanata ki is infrastracchar ke naam par kya hoga?’ There is no provision for participation of gram sabhas in the use of funds, while according to the Forest Rights Act, consent of gram sabhas is required
 congress kaa kahana he ki ye kanoon van adhikaar kanoon kaa ulanghan karata he
 Senior Congress leader and former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh had earlier written a letter to Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar regarding this provision, in which it was asked to amend the law
 ramesh kaa virodh adivaasiyon ke van adhikaron ko lekar tha
 On Wednesday, Congress President Sonia Gandhi also said in her party meeting that the government is violating the rights of tribals
 congress ne bill main ek sanshodhan kaa prastaav rakhaa he lekin uske paas abhi left auki jediu jaisi partiyon kaa hi samarthan he jo paryaapt nahin hoga
 The comments sipiai ke netaa di raja ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki sawaal sirf jangalon ko lagane or bachaane kaa nahin he balki ye bhi he ki fund ke istemaal main gramsabhaaon kii kya bhoomika hogi
 Therefore modification is necessary
 sutron ke mutabik paryaapt samarthan na hone par congress apane sanshodhan par voting nahin karaayegi
 On the other hand, the government has assured the opposition that it will include the role of Gram Sabha in the executive rules regarding CAF funds

 champions trophy ke final main fakhar jamaa or ajahar ali kii jodi ne pakistan team ko behtareen shuruyaat di
 These two shared a 128-run partnership for the first wicket
 is dauraan baayen haath ke ballebaaj fakhar ne champions trophy 2017 main lagaataar teesri 50 ran yaa isse adhik kii pari kheli
 In a crucial title match against India, Fakhar completed the half-century with the help of seven fours off 60 balls
 match main baad main unhone 92 gendon par 12 chauke, do chakke lagaakar apana shatak bhi puraa kiya, fakhar ke vanade kariyar kaa yah pehla shatak he
 Hardik Pandya, who scored 114 runs at the last minute, played a half-century against Pakistan and Sri Lanka
 jahaan england ke khilaaf unhone 57 ran banaae the, vahiin srilanka ke khilaaf unhone 50 ran banaae the
 The comments gauratlab he ki fakhar se pehle team india ke openar shikhar dhawan ne bhi is champions trophy main lagaataar teen maichon main 50 ran yaa isse adhik ke score kiye hai
 Fakhar also has a century in it like Dhawan
 bangladesh ke khilaaf toornament ke semifinal main shikhar 46 ran par out hokar ardhashatak se chuke the
 Earlier, he had scored 78 against South Africa, 125 against Sri Lanka and 68 in a group match against Pakistan

 However, the record of 50+ consecutive scores in the Champions Trophy is named after Ken Williamson of New Zealand
 unhone varsh 2013 or 2017 ke bich toornament main lagaataar chaar 50 ran se adhik ke score kiye
 Pakistan's Saeed Anwar has also scored three 50+ scores in 2000 and 2002 together
 lagaataar teen maichon main 50 yaa isse adhik kaa score banane waalon main england ke marcus trescothique bhi hai jinhone 2004 main yah uplabdhi hasil kii thi
 Significantly, before Fakhar, Team India's opener Shikhar Dhawan has also scored 50 runs or more in three consecutive matches in this Champions Trophy
 fakhar kii bhi dhawan kii hi tarah isamen se ek shatkeey pari he
 Shikhar was out for 46 in the semi-finals of the tournament against Bangladesh with a half-century
 isse pehle unhone dakshin africa ke khilaaf 78, srilanka ke khilaaf 125 or pakistan ke khilaaf group match main 68 ran kii pari kheli thi

 chhattisgarh ke bastar ke mongpal gaanv main pani kii tank bane dhai saal se zyada vakt biit gaya he, lekin dhai saal baad bhi pani kii line nahin bichhi he
 As a result, people have to fill water from far flung areas
 lekin ye pani kii tank unke bade kaam aa rahi he kyonki ilaake main mobile network nahin he, lihaaja is tank par chadh kar log mobile network pate hai
 Anyone who has to talk to mobile, he goes up on this tank, then becomes happy in the conversation
 pani kii tank par network khojate logbastar main dantewada se 33 kilometre dur mongpal gaanv kaa najaara dekhne laayak hota he
 People get trapped in the water tank from morning itself
 phir kavayad shuru hoti he mobile network dhundne kii
 There is an influx of people throughout the day to climb this tank
 pani tank ke upree hisse par ghanton log baat karte rahete hai
 When the talk of the people in the first innings is complete, then the people of the second innings, who are waiting to climb up, talk to their friends and relatives
 is gaanv main kisi ke bhi ghar telephone nahin he
 The entire population is connected through mobile communication
 agar tank par nahin chadhe to mobile network kaa muhaiyaa hona sambhav nahin hota
 Not only this, the mobile network is available only after going about 33 km from this village
 pipe line ke liye bajet sweekrut nahin huaaise gaanv main pani muhaiyaa karaane ke liye sarkaar ne 48 lakh rupee kharch karke is pani kii tank ko banwaaya tha, lekin varsh 2014 ke aakhri maheene main taiyaar hui is pani kii tank main aaj tak pani nahin bharaa ja sakaa, iskaa kaaran he ki yahaan pipe line hi nahin bich pai
 The officers showed great interest in constructing a water tank, but when the turn came to lay the pipeline, they turned away from Mongpal village
 bataaya gaya ki iske liye bajet hi sweekrut nahin hua
 More than two years passed by year
 gaanv ke sarpanch se lekar pradhan tak ne sabhi colector daftar main guhaar lagaai, to kabhi public health ejineering vibhaag ke chakkar kaate, lekin baat nahin bani
 Eventually, the villagers started making new use of it
 mobile tower ko nasht kar dete hai naksalemongpal gaanv kii aabaadi saadhe baarah sau he
 These areas are completely affected by Cenxal
 beasenel ne yahaan apana mobile tower lagaaya tha, lekin ise naksaliyon ne uda diya
 In the last five years, a mobile tower was installed here three times, but all three times the Naxalites demolished it
 bastar ke DIG kaa kahana he ki police or kendriya suraksha bal har koshish main lage rahete hai ki logon ko behatar mobile connactivity mili, lekin naksali unke armaanon par pani pher dete hai
 Whether Dantewada of Bastar is Yasukama, then Narayanpur or Bijapur
 naksali kahin par bhi mobile network nahin chaahate
 Due to damage to mobile towers, no private mobile company sets up its towers here
 is ilaake kii ek badi aabaadi ko jitani pani kii jarurat he, utani hi mobile network kii
 So that they too can take advantage of the communication facilities
 bijepi ab narendra modi ko pichhadaa netaa bataakar chunavi jang ladane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The reason for this is that in the big states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the hope of crowning Modi on the basis of development has started making him dream
 abhi tak vikaas kii dugudugi peetane vaale narendra modi kii mahattvakankshaon ne aakhirkaar unhen jatvaad kii god main phenk hi diya he
 After Nitish Kumar's divorce from JDU, BJP is bent on proving Narendra Modi a backward leader
 narendra modi khud gujarat kii ganchi jati se taalluk rakhte hai
 Till now they have shied away from both accepting it publicly and promoting it
 lekin ab gujarat ke hindu hriday samraat or vikaas purush kaa purusharth hawa ho gaya he
 In states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, BJP wants Modi to wear the shoes of a backward leader
 narendra modi ko vikaas kaa yoddha bataane vaali bijepi ne modi kaa mantra phoonk to diya he lekin ab wo chintaa main pad gai he
 In Bihar, 47 per cent of the voters belong to the Other Backward Classes
 uttar pradesh main ye taadaad 37 fisadi se zyaada he
 In Bihar, Lalu and Nitish are warriors of this vote bank, while Mulayam Singh and Mayawati in UP
 ab inke bich main modi kii gunjaaish vikaas ke dam par nikaalnaa bijepi ko bahut mushkil lag rahaa he
 BJP knows very well that none of its leaders could repeat the feat of Kalyan Singh being backward in Uttar Pradesh
 madhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan kaa pichhadaa hona bhi uske liye sabase badi puunji he
 In such a situation, he is finding it difficult to make Modi as the monarch of the power of Delhi by just calling him great
 nitish kumaar ne mahagathbandhan todakar chhathin baar bihar mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lee or vidhaan sabha main bahumat bhi sabit kar diya
 In such a situation, there is a lot of speculation about the attitude of Janata Dal United (JDU) co-founder and senior leader Sharad Yadav
 philhal sharad yadav kuch bhi kehane kii bajaae shant hai
 While RJD supremo Lalu Yadav has claimed from a TV channel that Sharad Yadav is with RJD
 kya RJD ke saath hai sharad?nitish kumaraka bijepi se haath milakar mahagathbandhan todane ke faisle par ab tak sharad yadav ne koi saarvajanik bayaan nahin diya he
 It is being said that Sharad Yadav is not happy with Nitish's decision
 vahiin ek tivi channel ko die ek saakshaatkaar main lalu yadav ne kaha, 'sharad yadav ne mujhase baat kii he
 They are in touch with us and have said that they are in favor of RJD
 jab hui 18 vipakshi dalon kii baithkbataa den ki haal hi main 18 vipakshi dalon kii hui baithak main nitish kii jagah hissaa lene vaale sharad yadav ne aashwast kiya tha ki unki party jediu, bijepi or piem modi ke khilaaf apni ladaai jari rakhegi
 The speculation of giving Sharad Yadav a ministerial post sparked speculation that Nitish Kumar might form a minister in the central government as soon as Nitish Kumar formed a government with the BJP
 lekin isi bich sharad yadav ne dilli main congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii
 On the other hand, angry JDU MP also met Sharad Yadav with the decision of alliance with BJP
 inamen varisht saansad ali alvar or virendra kumaar ke alaava party mahasachiv arun sinha or javed raja bhi shaamil the
 Finance Minister spoke to Sharad Yadav while Finance Minister Arun Jaitley spoke to Sharad Yadav over phone
 jetali ne sharad yadav se mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke faisle par gatirodh khatm karne kii guzarish kii
 Apart from Jaitley, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also interacted with Sharad Yadav over phone and apprised him of the entire development
