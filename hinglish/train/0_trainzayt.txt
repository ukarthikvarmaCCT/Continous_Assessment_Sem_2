 pole ke anusaar rajya kaa ek bada bahumat, 65 fisadi, yah maanata he ki je jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad rajya main ek bada raajnneetik khalipan aa gaya he or isane rajya main shashan kii gunvattta par kaaphi vipareet asar daalaa he
 Four out of every five people believe that the quality of governance in the state has deteriorated significantly in the last one year
 aadhe se zyada log yah maanate hai ki jayalalita ke na hone se ab AIADMK bikhar jaaegi
 4
 india today-karvi opinian pole se pataa chalata he ki AIADMK ke liye apane matadaataaon kaa aadhaar banaae rakhana mushkil ho rahaa he
 One out of every three voters who voted for the AIADMK in the 2016 election has decided that they will no longer vote for this party
 in asantusht matadaataaon main se kareeb 60 fisadi rajnikant kii party kii taraf jhukate dikh rahe hai, jabaki isamen se 26 fisadi log diemke kii taraf ja sakate hai
 5
 survey ke anusaar DMK ke kuch voters bhi rajnikant kii party kii taraf jate dikh rahe hai
 However, its voter base is somewhat safer compared to AIADMK
 DMK ke har paanch main ek matadaata ab party se dur ja chukaa he
 63% of these disgruntled voters have decided to vote for Rajinikanth's party
 6
 According to the survey, Rajinikanth's party seems to be starting well in Tamil Nadu politics
 abhi chunaav hue to party ko 16 fisadi mat mil sakate hai
 This is when Rajinikanth's party has neither fixed a formal name nor announced any symbol
 superstar se netaa bane rajnikant ne abhi tak to koi abhiyaan bhi nahin shuru kiya he
 Therefore, it seems that by the next election, his party will become a strong political force in the state
 7
 However, according to the survey, majority of the people of the state believe that due to being outsiders, it will not be easy for Rajinikanth to make a place in the politics of Tamil Nadu
 rajani ko is samasya se nibatna hoga
 Not only this, more than half of the people in the survey also believe that Rajinikanth is not able to fill the vacancy that has come after Jayalalithaa and that is why dmk's voter base in the state seems to be increasing at present
 8
 According to the survey, no clear picture has emerged within the AIADMK as to who can be the real heir to Jayalalithaa's legacy
 o panniraselvam ko ike palanisvami kii tulana main thodi badhat hasil he, lekin survey main shaamil logon main is par amrai nahin he
 More than 30 per cent of the people surveyed believe that none of the current leadership of AIADMK like o Panneerselvam, EK Palaniswamy, TTV Dinakaran, Deepa Jayakumar and Sasikala Natarajan are the real heirs of Jayalalithaa's legacy
 9
 The majority of 64 per cent of the survey considered the performance of EK Palaniswami to be poor or very poor
 naukari ke srijan, skool, college, aspataal or udyongon kii dasha, kisaanon kii haalat aadi pramukh aarthik or saamaajik parameter ko lekar bahut asantosh he
 10
 survey main em karunanidhi ko ab tak kaa tamilnadu kaa sarvshereshthamukhyamantrimana gaya he or unhen 29 fisadi logon ne sarvshereshth mana he, unke baad 25 fisadi pasand ke saath mjiaar or 21 fisadi ke saath jayalalita kaa sthaan he

 Taapsee Pannu was a big hit after Pink Movie
 ection-thriller or phir mahilaon kii aazaadee jaise mudde ko uthaakar taapasi pannu ne apni ek khaas jagah banaai he
 But for the first time she will try her hand at comedy

 garmi kii chhuttiyon ke khatm hote hi shuru hoti he barsaat
 The rain that the whole world waits for in such a way that the arrival of all the problems and troubles will evaporate and why not
 aakhir wo lu ke thapede, suraj kaa atyaachaar sab ek jatke se gaayab hi to ho jate hai
 The rain that awaits, from a normal citizen to an agricultural farmer
 hamaare bachapan ke dinon main ham iskaa intjaar kheti-baadi ke bajaay masti ke liye kiya karte the
 When we used to walk with our hull boat
 ham uskaa tab tak saath dete jab tak ki vah kisi baari jalpravaah main villin na ho jaataa
 Unabashed and nonchalant
 schuli dinon main ham apni claces main baithkar kabhi indra se nivedan kiya karte to kabhi mithkeey kahaniyon ko sach maanate hue tamaam shaharon ke naam jinke ant main poor laga he kii list banaate rahete
 Seeing the light swirling of the cloud, he patted his back as if everything was happening because of us instead of some atmospheric pressure
 kabhi barish main sune jane vaale geeton kaa casette sahi karte to barish se pehle hi jhula baandhne lagate
 Rainy also used to bring ripe berries with him, and where can he buy the fun berries that are in the food by breaking from the tree and killing him? barish khud ke saath aam kaa natural pakaav bhi to lekar aati he
 The taste of ripe mangoes can be felt only by the person who has eaten it
 pehali barish ke saath gaanv ketal-talaiyonse baahar nikalne vaale pile-pile mendhak
 We used to jump around to the extent of fatigue behind them
 har barish ke baad gaanv ke pokhar or talaiyon kaa muyna ki is baar kitne inch barish hui he
 How will this rain affect our agriculture, etc
 barish khud ke saath kai baar skool bandi kii khabaren bhi lekar aata
 It is revealed that today is Rainy Day at school
 haalanki is maamle main hamaari kismat hameshaa kharaab hi rahi
 Just before the school timings start, the rain falls and then we don't have a single excuse
 phir ham jaise hi skool main pahunchaae jate barish shuru ho jaati
 We used to take Indra to mind and take our little mouth and stare at the rain from the class window
 barish khud ke saath daal kii behtareen pakodee or bhutte lekar aati
 Now the corn is available all year round, but when Grandpa used to bring corn from his field and grandmother would roast them on coals of coal
 barish to ab bhi hoti he magar ab vah pehle vaali baat kahaan
 Where is that carefree? ab kii peediyaan to barish ke sampark main aane se hi darati hai
 It seems as if they are not looking for a soil and will be swept away in the rain
 barish ke samay khel ke maidan main hone ke bajaay computer ke screen par game khelaa karti hai
 So the bottom line of saying so many things is that if it rains a little, get wet
 ho saktaa he dil ke kisi kone main jo kuch ankaha-andekha sulag rahaa he vah bujh jaae or aap ko kuch acha-acha sa lage
 After the rest of the season, then thank you very slowly
 bade jatan se likhaa he

 vahiin yadi mahagathbandhan kii kavayad main lagi congress, samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or trinmul congress ek hokar chunaav ladate hai to loksabhaa ke trishanku hone kii sambhaavna he
 According to MOTN, July 2018, there is a possibility that the opposition will unite and form a mahagathbandhan, which will mainly consist of Congress, TMC, SP, BSP and JD (S)
 
 to yah gathbandhan 224 siten jitkar endie kii barabari par aa saktaa he
 Whose seats will be reduced to 228 in the presence of the Grand Alliance
 aise main sansad trishanku hogi or bhaajapa kii apni siten ghatakar 194 par aa jaaegi
 Though the BJP will still be the largest party, it will have to depend on the split of the parties to form the government
 is sthiti main bijepi ke sabase damdaar chehre pradhanmantri narendra modi kii saakh ko jhatka lagegaa
 It is possible that they stay away from such coalition government
 is survey main ek teesri sambhaavna bhi he, jisamen yadi annadramuk endie main shaamil ho jaati he
 Even then, the NDA coalition may lag behind by a majority
 bataa den ki july main kiya gaya MOTN kaa yah surveykshan batalaata he ki ek saal pehle ke survey main bijepi ko jo 298 siton kii aaramdaayak badhat hasil hui thi, vah ghatakar 245 siton par aa gai he
 For example, the BJP on its own will be 27 seats short of the majority figure of 272 seats
 haalanki survey yah bhi bataata he ki endie apane sahyogi dalon ke saath 281 siten jeetne main kaamyaab hogi
 Therefore, it will not have the convenience of a larger majority than it is today

 At that time, the BSP also received nearly 27 percent of the votes of the BJP candidate

 In most of the seats in Madhya Pradesh, the main contest is between the BJP and the Congress, but in some seats the BSP and other smaller parties are also playing a decisive role

 There are a number of myths prevalent among people generally about the pirids
 periods ko lekar ye myth daadi-nani ke jamaane se chale aa rahe hai
 There are some such beliefs which are completely wrong in the minds of young people raised with these myths
 aapako bhi kai baar periods hone par aisi hidaayaten jarur mili hongi ki thande pani se nahin nahaana chahie, eksrasij nahin kerani chahie, achaar khaane se parhez karnaa chahie, lekin hakeekat bilkul alag he, jisko jaanane kii har mahila ko jarurat he
 Today, we are telling you some such truths related to periods, which will reduce the fear in your mind about the periods to a great extent
 Myth:periods ke dauraan eksrasij karnaa khatarnaak hota havect:agar aapkoexrasij karne kii aadat haito aap bina chintaa karen apane periods main bhi eksrasij kar sakati hai
 According to a report, do 150 minutes or at least 75 minutes of exercise every week
 kyonki is dauraan aane vaala pasinaa period main hone vaale pet dard ko kam karata he
 Myth: The period should be over in a week Fact: Everybody's body works differently
 isliye sabhi kii mensuration cycle alag hoti he
 Changes keep on changing this cycle according to the changing age
 Myth:periods se pehle koi syndrome nahin hotarytecht:aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi kiduniya bhar main 50 fisadi mahilaayeinpre mensuration syndrome se prabhavit hoti hai
 During this time, women have to face problems like mood swings, abdominal pain, nervousness
 Myth:periods ke dauraan mahila pregnant nahin ho saktixcht:haalanki periods ke dauraan garbh dhaaran karne ke gunjaaish kam hoti he
 But it is not at all that a woman cannot become pregnant during her period
 Myth:jo mahilaayein ek duusare ke saath rahati hai, unako periods bhi ek time par hote handlenut:aam taur par logon kii aisidharna he ki jo mahilaayein saath rahatihain unhe ek hi samay par periods hote hai
 But this is not the case
 kaha to yah bhi jaataa he ki agar mahilaayein ek hi tarah kaa khaanaa khaati hon, eksrasij karti hon, ek samay par soti hon to unako ek hi samay par periods hote honge

 dilli sarkaar ke dengue or chikangunia se nipatane ko lekar lagaae gaye nae poster or hording par kai sawaal khadey ho gaye hai
 Instead of making the general public aware, the government is advising Delhiites to go to war with deadly disease

 aap pravaktaa saurabh bharadwaj kaa kahana he ki jaagruk karne ke liye jab ek hi massej dena ho, to us massej ko ri-package karnaa hota he
 If the same poster is shown again and again, people will get bored of it

 Although the prevention of dengue and chikungunya is the work of the MCD, the Delhi government also spreads awareness so that people do not let water collect in their homes

 On a question, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj defended his government, saying that before the election it was said that BJP is responsible for spreading dengue and chikungunya, but again BJP got votes and Delhi government tried its best Will spread Kidengu and Chikungunyan

 As Lok Sabha elections are coming closer, populist schemes are also showing in various states
 isaki badi misaal he odisha, jahaan loksabhaa ke saath hi vidhansabha ke chunaav bhi hone hai
 In view of this, Naveen Patnaik's government started the Kalia scheme for farmers
 rajya sarkaar ne kisaanon ko madad dene ke liye krishak assistance for livelihud and inakam ogmentation (kaaliya) kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Its objective was to reduce poverty and increase prosperity in agriculture
 lekin yah yojana vivaadon ke ghere main bhi ai thi
 Not caring for him now, Patnaik has thrown another dice for the youth
 lekin yah bhi kaaliya se judi he
 This scheme, called the Kalia Scholarship, is for the children of the beneficiaries of the Kalia Scheme who want technical and professional education
 kaaliya chaatravrutti yojana ke jariye sarkaar kaa makasad kisaan pariwaron main maanav sansaadhan kaa vikaas karnaa he
 The state government claims that the Kalia scheme is a unique scheme of its kind across the country, designed to help the farmers
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki kaaliya yojana ko duusare rajya bhi apana rahe hai
 Regarding the Kalia Scholarship Scheme, the state government claims that through this, no student of farmer families will remain untouched by technical and professional education and will be able to fulfill their dreams
 is yojana ke tahat kisaan parivaar ke chaatro ko padhaane main hone vaale course fees, hostel fees or mess fees jaise saare kharche rajya sarkaar hi uthaaegi
 The government has asked various departments to provide a list of children of the beneficiaries of the Kalia scheme so that the benefits of this scheme can reach the farmer families as soon as possible
 garib kisaan chaatro ko embibies, bidies, bemes, bi
 The state government will get support for the study of a total of 13 technical or professional subjects including pharma
 sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha he ki kaaliya chaatravrutti kii rakam yogya chaatro ke sidhe khaaton main hastantarit kii jaaegi
 Nonetheless, critics have criticized the Kalia scheme, calling the agrarian crisis a major electoral issue in Odisha
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki patnayak sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main bina taiyaari kaaliya yojana shuru kar di
 Governments in Odisha's neighboring states of Telangana, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh have already made various announcements for farmers
 isliye bhi patnayak sarkaar ne jaldbaaji main is yojana kii ghoshnaa kar di
 But going one step further, Naveen Patnaik has announced the Kalia Scholarship
 jaahir he, chunavi ghadi main patnayak bhi koi jokhim uthaanaa nahin chaahate

 Sushil Modi has said that the situation in Bihar has worsened in the last 1 year and that is why we have issued this report card exactly one day before the government completes 1 year on November 20 so that all these questions of Bihar The Chief Minister was able to answer
 vipaksh ne maang kii he ki 20 november ko jab bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar apana report card pesh karenge to unhen keval pichley ek saal kaa report card pesh karnaa chahie, naa ki apane mukhyamantri kaal ke 11 saal kaa
 Because 7 of those 11 years
 5 saal bhaajapa bhi sarkaar main shaamil thi
 There are clear indications from Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi that if the UPA does not get the number to form a government, then the Congress would prefer to sit in the opposition
 haalanki party post pole elliance partner dhundne kii koshish zarur karegi, lekin tisare morche ko samarthan dene jaisi baton par party main ek raay nahin he
 Congress leaders like Salman Khurshid have said that the Congress can form a government by supporting the Third Front to keep 'communal forces' away from power
 isi tarah kii baat sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik sachiv ahamed patel kii taraf se bhi kii gai
 However, he later clarified that he did not mean to support the Third Front
 asal main congress kii uhapoh kii haalat ke peeche do mukhya kaaran hai
 One is that even if he thinks very happy, the number of seats does not seem to go beyond 100-110
 haalanki party 140 seat tak laane par jor laga rahi he
 Due to its slim condition, the Congress knows that power is not easy this time
 kisi tarah jod-tod kar sarkaar banane se ek to sthayitv nahin rahegaa or doosraa yah ki elliance partner apane-apane hisaab se khinchataan karenge, jisase upie kii badanaami or bad sakati he
 In such a situation, staying away from power would be a better option
 lekin duusari taraf vah bijepi ko satta se dur rakhana chaahati he, isliye party netaaon ke ek tabake ko lagata he ki baahar se samarthan dekar bhi tisare morch kii sarkaar banane ke liye congress ko taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 But it is being said that Rahul is not ready for this
 akhir rahul parhez kyon karnaa chaahate hai? yah jaanane ke liye congress ke itihaas main thodaa peeche chalate hai
 The Congress won 404 seats in 1984 riding on the sympathy wave that followed the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 lekin boforce ghotaale, punjab main aatankwaad ityadi ke mudde par congress sarkaar ghirti gai
 In the 1989 election, the Congress got only 197 seats, but instead of forming the government, the Congress fought against the Congress and won the VP Singh government
 yah sarkaar lambii nahin chali
 Annoyed by VP Singh's appointment as Prime Minister instead of Devi Lal, Chandrashekhar formed the Samajwadi Janata Party by taking a separate route from the Janata Dal with 64 mps
 congress ne samarthan dekar chandrashekhar ko piem bana diya
 a few months later, the Chandrasekhar government was accused of spying on Rajiv Gandhi
 congress ne samarthan waapas le liya
 Rajiv Gandhi was killed in the midst of the 1991 election
 congress ko 244 siten milin
 The party again came to power and PV Narasimha Rao became the Prime Minister
 sarkaar banane or bachaane ke liye narsimharav par jeemem saansadon kii kareed-farokht ke aarope lage
 The controversy caught fire, but the government completed its term
 90 ke dashak se hi gathbandhan sarkaron kaa daur shuru ho chukaa tha
 The BJP ruled from 1998 to 2004 by forming the National Democratic Alliance, or NDA, with 24 parties
 1999 ke chunaav main congress mahaz 114 seat par simat gai thi
 There was also a question that Congress could not run a coalition government
 2004 ke chunaav main congress ko 145 siten milin
 The Congress became the United Progressive Alliance (UPA)
 sarkaar puure paanch saal chali
 Significantly, despite the 2008 global economic crisis, the Congress emerged as the single largest party in 2009 with 206 seats
 baat sarkaar banane kii ai, to party ke ranneetikaron main se ek janardan dvivedi jaise netaa ne gathbandhan sarkaar banane ke khilaaf apni raay di
 He believed that the Congress has proved itself in coalition politics by running a coalition government for a full five years
 congress ne upie van kii apni uplabdhiyon ke aadhaar par apane liye bahumat maanga tha, jo votaron ne nahin diya
 So when the party has not got the mandate, it should sit in the opposition
 is tark ke peeche akalan yah tha ki congress ke bina jo bhi milijuli sarkaar banegi, vah pangu sabit hogi or kuch maheene yaa ekaadh saal kii mehmaan hogi
 After its fall, there will be elections again, in which Congress should fight with all its strength
 unhone 1989 kaa udhaaharan bhi diya, jab 197 siten hone ke baavjood rajeev gandhi ne sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne kii bajaay sarkaar se baahar baithna pasand kiya
 Two years later in 1991, the Congress returned to power again
 (haalanki isamen rajeev gandhi kii hatya se upji sahanubhuti bhi badi vajah rahi) lekin dvivedi ke tark ko nahin suna gaya or upie tu kii sarkaar bani
 The numbers that the Congress got due to many good works during UPA One were lost due to not being able to control the scams, scams and inflation that came out during UPA 2 and especially during the last two years
 pichley disambar main dilli ke chunaav main congress kii karaari haar ke baad bhi party netaaon ke ek tabake kii raay thi ki janata ne na to sarkaar banane kaa or na hi sarkaar banavaane kaa janadesh diya he, lekin phir bhi congress ne aam aadmi party ko samarthan dekar arvind kejariwal ko mukhyamantri banane diya
 Kejriwal may have resigned from power in 49 days, but the Congress experience was not good during this period
 sarkaar banavaa kar bhi use kharikhoti sunani padi
 After the experience of forming and forming a government in Delhi at the Center in 2009 and 2013, in December, the party has started to feel that it is harmful to play its role in going or forming a government apart from the mandate
 rahul or unke qaribiyon ko lagata he ki puure number na aane ke baavjood sarkaar banane banavaane ke khel main shaamil hone se congress apni hi zamin khoti he or khoyegi
 In the event of meeting a fractured mandate, whichever party may form a government by manipulating it, the Congress should quietly wait for its turn
 is bich congress apni sanghathanaatmak kamazoriyon ko dur karne kaa kaam kare
 There should be an attempt to revive the party in states like up-bihar
 mili-juli sarkaar kii sthayitv kaa bharosa nahin hota
 In such a situation, as soon as the government falls, the Congress is gearing up to achieve electoral success
 isse na to us par gathbandhan saathiyon ke saamne jhuk-jhuk kar sarkaar chalaane kii majaburi hogi, na hi sabko saath saadhane main apni urja kharch kerani hogi
 Rahul will also have time to move forward in the way he wants to hand over the party to the youth
 party ke ek dhade ke mutabik nichle str se lekar congress kaarysmiti or yahaan tak ki party main mahasachiv, adhyaksh, upaadhyaksh samet tamaam padon ke liye chunaav karaane jaisi baton ko lagu karnaa chaahate hai, ve sab karen
 Bring a new Congress party in front of the country
 isliye vipaksh main baithna congress ko bhavishya ke liye taiyaar karegaa, iske barakes satta main shaamil hone vaali partiyon par delyver karne kaa dabaav hoga or sarkaar chalaane ke kram main ve galatiyaan bhi karengi
 So that weight and watch would be the right strategy

 It is clearly visible in the video, due to having so many children on the back, the female opossum is in a lot of trouble, she is not able to move, then perhaps it is seen moving for the sake of children
 is maadaa opessam ko chalane main isliye or bhi pareshaani ho rahi he, kyonki uske peeth par baithe bachche uchhal-kud kar rahe hai
 If they are ever slipping then try to climb up again by holding the mother's body hair

 ) On August 30, Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew his "gift" of the Land Acquisition Act imposed on the country on the eve of the New Year in "mann Ki Baat" after taking stock of political loss and damage for eight months
 kanoon vaapasi ko kisaan hitaishi kadam bataane ke baavjood unhone doharaaya ki pichhlaa kadam bhi deshhit main hi tha
 Not only this, Modi has beautifully removed the land acquisition law from his neck and pushed it towards the states
 centre chahta he ki jameen lene ke maamle main rajya apane hisaab se kanoon banaaen
 But, what does it mean to move the ball from center to state? Will the farmer now have to give his land according to the UPA government's 2013 law or will the state make the law, according to which the farmer will get the land? Or is there any way which is Bahujan Hitaya
 vaise, in sawaalon kaa jawaab aane se pehle hi audyogic jagat ne modi ke is faisle par turant niraashaa jataakar yah sanket to de hi diya ki modi sarkaar kaa kanoon kam se kam uske hit main to tha hi
 On the other hand, Jairam Ramesh Sadhi, the leader of the main opposition party Congress and the architect of the UPA government's ground law, responds, "satyamev Jayate
 ” lekin is sawaal par ki kya congress is jeet se santusht he, ramesh bataate hai, “nahin, modi sarkaar ne jaan-boojhkar gend rajyon ke paale main daali he
 In such a situation, if the state starts making arbitrary laws, then the original spirit of the 2013 law will be in danger and farmers will again face the risk of eviction from the land
 ”yani sarkaar or vipaksh, donon maan rahe hai ki jameen kii ladaai dilli se nikalakar rajyon kii rajdhaniyon main pahunchane vaali he
 In such a situation, India Today studied the model of taking the land of some states where the government got the land for development works without any major opposition
 uttar pradesh, andhra pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh or gujarat aise rajyon main sabase aage najar aa rahe hai, jinhone philhal kisaanon se raji-khushi jameen lene ke dhang khoj liye hai
 In Uttar Pradesh's land purchase model Lucknow, in the era of the Mayawati government, the building of a tourism building is seen if you go ahead with the egalitarian chairaeha who presented Dalit leaders in a proud manner
 yahaan pehali manzil par uttar pradesh industrial expresve deveopment athurity (upida) ke daftar main siio navaneet sahagal ke saamne ek count down calendar par likhaa he 431 din baaki
 Sehgal says, "there are only so many days left to complete the expressway
" is calendar main roj ek din ghat jaataa he or sadak kaa kaam usee anupaat main bad jaataa he
 “this six-lane expressway connecting Agra to Lucknow is an extension of the 165 km Yamuna Expressway from Noida to Agra
 lekin donon express ve main sirf itnaa fark nahin he ki ek mayawati ke raaj main bana tha or doosraa akhilesh yadav ke raaj main ban rahaa he
 The real difference is that when the Yamuna Expressway was to be built, the land acquisition for it was in tremendous controversy
 kisaanon ne jaan kii baaji lagaakar iskaa virodh kiya or police ne goliyaan chalaayin
 In 2011, the then central government's prince Rahul Gandhi himself sat on a dharna in protest against it and somewhere the same protest led to the upa's 2013 Land Acquisition Act
 mayawati sarkaar ne 165 kimi lambey expresve ke liye kul 6,600 hectare jameen adhigrahit kii thi
 Of this, 2,500 hectares of land was for real estate projects
 vahiin isse takreeban dogune agra-lakhanu expresve ke liye sarkaar isse aadhi yani 3,368 hectare jameen hi le rahi he
 In this way, compared to Yamuna Expressway, one-fourth of the land is being taken per kilometer of road in agra-lucknow Expressway
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kehete hai, “hamen danda ke jor par vikaas nahin thopanaa he
 That is why instead of acquiring land, the government found a practical way to buy land from farmers at an expensive price
 ” upida ke liye prashasan ke sthaneey adhikari jameen kharidenge
 The DM of the district will keep a direct watch on the matter and Sehgal himself will monitor the reports of all the districts throughout the day
 expresve ke liye upida ne 10 jilon main prachlit cirkil rate se chaar guna keemat par jameen kharidi he
 In some cases, land was also acquired, but here it was rated higher than the purchase
 ab tak 27,000 se zyada kisaan sarkaar ko apni jameen bech chuke hai or kisi ke adaalat main jane kii khabar nahin he
 Sehgal says, "all is possible with dialogue, just win the trust of your people once
 sari registriyaan online huin or kisaan ko turant unke bank khate main paisa transfar kiya gaya
 15,000 crores
 kii is pariyojna main jameen kii kharid par upida ab tak 3,000 karod ru

 adhigrahan kii jagah jameen kharid kaa yah model philhal kaamyaab najar aa rahaa he
 Land pooling in Andhra Pradesh; Andhra Pradesh is ousted from its capital Hyderabad in the south
 iske liye mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ne guntur jile main hi duusari sadi isa purv tak satvaahan raajaaon kii rajdhani rahi amravati ke naam par nai rajdhani banane kaa faisla kiya
 But it is not a Mahabharata period that Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, who was evicted from Hastinapur, should settle at Indraprastha at the place he wanted
 nai rajdhani ke liye jameen chahie or vah bhi bina kisi vivaad ke
 That is why Naidu avoided words like land acquisition, because this word only irritates people
 isaki jagah land pooling ke jariye kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Under this, there is a provision for giving land plot to residential plot, commercial plot and fixed compensation every year
 land pooling ke tahat jameen dene vaale ko 1,000 varg gaj kaa awasaiya plot, 300 varg gaj kaa commercial plot diya ja rahaa he
 Along with this, Rs 30,000 per year in lieu of crop loss on unirrigated land
 or sinchit jameen par salanaa 50,000 ru
 Will be given as a type of pension
 is pension main bhi har saal 10 fisadi kii dar se 10 saal tak ijapha hota rahegaa
 The special thing is that these facilities are not only to be given to the owners of houses and land, but also to the tenants and landless laborers
 pehle hi din jis tarah se 540 kisaanon ne apni 850 acre jameen land pooling ke liye di, usase patachalata he ki yojana ko kis tarah hathohath liya ja rahaa he
 Rajasthan too, after becoming Chief Minister in December 2013, Vasundhara Raje made preparations to introduce a new land acquisition law in the western state of Rajasthan
 nae kanoon ke bare main raaje ne kaha, “hamaara makasad bhoomi adhigrahan kii prakriya ko tej karnaa he, bhale hi iske liye hamen bhu-swami ko zyada paisa dena pade
 “actually, she wanted the average time taken for land acquisition to be reduced by five years
 sitambar 2014 main rajasthan cabinet se paas vidheyak main bhoomi adhigrahan ke muaavje main banpar oochaal laane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 Under this, arrangements were made to double the circle rate in the city, compensation of two to four and a half times at more than five km from the city and up to nine times at more than that distance
 baad main yah vidheyak vidhansabha kii salect cameti ko bhej diya gaya
 The government had become a little loose about this so that the situation of land acquisition from the center first became clear
 lekin ab jab modi ne gend waapas rajyon ke paale main daal di he to bhoomi adhigrahan ke kai kanoonon ke saath is prastaavit kanoon par bhi logon kii najar hogi
 Mutual Consent in Chhattisgarh When Chhattisgarh emerged as a new state in September 2000, when it came out as a new state, this state, named after Adivasi Asmita, dreamed of making a grand capital
 tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ke mukhyamantri ajit jogi ne 2002 main raipur ke paas hi nayaa raipur shahar basaane kii pahal shuru kii
 But the credit for implementing the project goes to the Raman Singh government of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 nai rajdhani ke liye jameen hasil karnaa yahaan bhi badi chunauti thi
 The government established the Naya Raipur Development Authority (NRDA) to settle the capital in an area touching 41 villages
 27 gaanvon main 5,500 hectare jameen kaa adhigrahan karne vaale enardie ke chairman en bajendra kumaar ne india today ko bataaya, “hamane 1894 ke bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon kii bajaae kisaanon ko paraspar sahmati se jameen dene kaa vikalp diya
 "2,700 hectares of land for Naya Raipur was taken in a similar way, while land acquisition law was used for 130 hectares of land
 kisaanon ko 2006 se 2012 ke bich prati acre 6 se 12 lakh ru
 Compensated up to aktubar 2012 main vidhivat udghaatan dekhne vaale is shahar ke liye bhoomi hasil karne ke lacheele tareeke ke bare main bajendra kumaar ne kaha, “muaavje ke alaava kisaanon ko viksit plot, 15,000 ru
 Facilities such as pension per acre per year, heavy exemption in registration charge for purchase of land from compensation amount
 ” iske alaava jameen dene waalon ke liye skill deveopment training or nayaa raipur main dukaan chalaane par do saal tak kiraye main puri chhot jaisi sahuliyatein haal main jod di gayi
 Although despite all these efforts some protests from the farmers regarding Naya Raipur came into view, but the protest was not very fierce as compared to the size of the project
 kuch maamalon main kisaan adaalat bhi gaye
 In this case, Naya Raipur seems to be slightly behind Amravati's model
 gujarat kaa bijness frendli modelbaat bhoomi adhigrahan kii ho or gujarat kaa zikr na aae, yah kaise sambhav he
 Here will talk about the Gujarat government's land acquisition model, which was also praised by the Manmohan Singh government
 centre sarkaar ke audyogic niti or protsaahan vibhaag ne axenture company ko “bharat main kaarobaari maahaul ko behatar bananay vishay par report taiyaar karne ko kaha tha
 In this report in May 2014, Gujarat was ranked as the best state in terms of land management
 gujarat sarkaar ne is kaam ke liye gujraj audyogic vikaas nigam (jiidisi) kii sthapana kii or use vishesh adhikaar die
 This included rights such as fair bargaining on the land deal and the offer to give the plot developed in lieu of the land
 jameen adhigrahan main sabase badi dikkat asal bazaar bhav kii aati he
 In such a situation, the services of the Center for Environment Planning and Technology University were used to determine the market price
 iske alaava jiidisi ne jahaan-jahaan bhoomi adhigrahan kiya vahaan 50 skill deveopment centres banaae gaye or jameen dene vaale parivaar ke ek-ek vyakti ko rojgaar dene kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya
 In order to listen to the grievances of the public, online process was also started to settle the complaint in the name of GIDC Mitra
 report ke mutabik, yah prakriya shuru hone ke baad bhoomi adhigrahan kii dar main chaar guna kii vruddhi hui
 By the way, if there is talk of growth, then the growth rate of the country is tilting, the stock market is peeping, the value of rupee is getting muted and property prices are going down for two years

 The entire matter will eventually be scattered over the delta of land acquisition
 sarkarein kathin kanoon chahengi or janata virodh karegi
 Maybe, in such a situation, the experience of these five states of the country will somehow work for the rest of the states and the Modi government

 His victory during the 2017 Rajya Sabha election has been challenged in court by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Balwant Singh Rajput, who contested against him
 ahamed patel is maamle main pehali baar apana bayaan darj karaane ke liye court main pesh honge
 The Gujarat High Court had asked Ahmed Patel to appear in court on June 20 to record his statement
 ahamed patel ne apana halafanama saunpane kii taiyaari kar lee he

 ' supreme courtne apane ek aadesh main yah saaf kar diya he ki desh ke kisi bhi naagarik ko aadhaar card nahin hone ke kaaran kisi laabh se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The court has told all the state governments that they will have to follow the order that no person will be harassed due to lack of Aadhaar card issued by the Special Identification Authority of India
 jaj je
 a three-member bench headed by Chelameswar said on Monday, 'meanwhile, it has been brought to our notice that various authorities are pushing for Aadhaar identity card
 ham kisi ghatana vishesh kaa zikr nahin kar rahe hai
 We expect all authorities as well as the Center and the States to abide by the order dated 23 September 2013

 As soon as the hearing of the case started, on behalf of a petitioner, senior advocate Gopal Subramaniam said that despite the court order, the authorities are insisting for Aadhaar card in cases of lease deed and marriage registration etc
 yah gambhir chintaa kaa vishay he
 On this, the judges said, 'such incidents have also come to our notice
 ' unhone centre sarkaar kii ore se pesh solicytor general ranjit kumaar se kaha ki yah sunishchit kiya jaae ki uske pehle ke aadesh kaa praadhikari paalan karen
 The court said that you have no excuse for this
 solicytor general ne kaha ki centre sarkaar sabhi rajyon ke mukhya sachivon ko is bare main patr likhegi
 The Aadhaar card of PF is not necessary
 The Solicitor General later told the court that all the states are parties to the case and in such a situation they can be asked to ensure the execution of judicial order
 jiladhikariyon jaise adhikariyon ko is bare main suchit kiya ja saktaa he
 During the hearing of the case, the judges said that according to this circular, judges of the Bombay High Court were also asked to provide Aadhaar numbers to the authorities
 haalanki ek vakil ne kaha ki yah mudda ab khatm ho gaya he
 The court is hearing petitions filed against the decision of some state governments to make Aadhaar card mandatory in many cases including salary, provident fund distribution and marriage as well as property registration
 is maamle main court ab july ke duusare saptaah main aage vichaar karegaa
 The Supreme Court on Monday told Subramaniam that he could file an interim application for alleged violation of the court order referring to a certain case
 visthapiton ko aadhaar card nahincourt ne kaha ki is tarah kaa saamaanya aadesh upyogi nahin hoga
 We will look into this particular case to ensure the order is implemented
 isse pehle, court ne kaha tha ki aadhaar card anivaary nahin hoga or yadi kisi vyakti ke paas aadhaar nahin he to use sarkari laabhon or gas conection, vaahan panjikaran or bhavishya nidhi jaisi sevaaon se vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The court had asked the central government not to issue Aadhaar cards to the illegal migrants, as this would make their stay valid

 After the announcement of candidates by the Aam Aadmi Party on the Rajya Sabha seats of Delhi, all the leaders of the party have become silent
 aam aadmi party ne apane varisht netaa sanjay singh, jane-maane chartered acountint narayan gupta or mashhoor kaarobaari susheel gupta ko rajyasabha kii 3 siton ke liye namankit kiya he
 With the announcement of these three names, the other big leaders of the party and poet Kumar Vishwas, who have been dreaming of going to Rajya Sabha for two years, have fallen water
 sapane toote to udhaas vishwaas ne media main aakar kejariwal par hamalaa bolte hue kah diya ki unhen party ne sargical strike or jeenyu masale par kathith sach rahane kii sazaa di he
 No party leader reacted to Vishwas's statement
 ab alam yah he ki party ke tamaam netaa hont silakar baith gaye hai
 After all, what happened at the PAC meeting? a total of 9 members attended the PAC meeting held on Wednesday
 do paden sadasyon ke alaava 7 sadasyon ke bich rajyasabha ke 3 ummidavaaron ke naam par charchaa hui
 The PAC meeting named party leader Sanjay Singh, chartered accountant Narayan Gupta and businessman Sushil Gupta
 sanjay singh ke naam parasabhi piesi netaaon ke bich ek sur main sahmati dikhaai di
 At the same time, no one raised objections to the name of Chartered Accountant Narayan Gupta
 lekin jaise hi baithak main susheel gupta kaa naam saamne rakhaa gaya baithak main maujuud kai netaaon main asahajata saamne aa gai
 However, apart from Ashutosh, a senior party leader and himself a contender for Rajya Sabha, no other members of the PAC meeting objected to the names of Sushil Gupta or Narayan Gupta
 sutara bataate hai ki sirf ashutosh ne susheel gupta ke naam par aitraaj kiya or baithak main yah sawaal uthaaya ki aakhir kis aadhaar par unhen rajyasabha bheja jaae
 Apart from Ashutosh, none of the leaders involved in the PAC meeting said a word and by a majority, these 3 names were approved by the PAC
 vidhayakon kii baithak main kya hua?aam aadmi party kii piesi kii baithak ke baad party ke sabhi netaa kejariwal ke ghar main us vakt pahunche jab party ke sabhi vidhayakon ko charchaa ke liye bulaayaa gaya tha
 The leaders announced these 3 names in front of the mlas
 sanjay singh ke naam par jahaan vidhayakon main khushi dikhi vahiin narayan gupta or susheel gupta ke naam par baithak main maujuud 55 se zyada vidhayakon kii bheed main sannata chaa gaya
 Sources reveal that despite the resentment and uneasiness evident on the faces of the mlas, no MLA dared the high command to question these two names
 party ke bhavi rajyasabha saansadon ke naam par alaakaman kaa farmaan lekar party ke sabhi vidhayak baithak khatm hote hi baahar nikal aae or media ke camere ke saamne chuppi saadh lee
 Did Sushil Gupta meet the mlas? Insiders from the Aam Aadmi Party say that three to four days ago businessman Sushil Gupta gave a party in Delhi where some mlas of the Aam Aadmi Party had joined
 sutron ke mutabik nyauta sabhi vidhayakon ko diya gaya tha lekin sirf 5 se 7 aam aadmi party ke vidhayak hi susheel gupta kii party main hissaa banane gaye
 Interestingly, three-four days ago, the party's MLA from Chandni Chowk, Alka Lamba, had tweeted a tweet on social media that wrote 'sushil'
 aam aadmi party main chuppi kyon?aisa kai baar hua he jab aam aadmi party kisi na kisi vivaad main ghiri ho or netaaon ke saamne mushkilen khadi hon, lekin der-saver party ke netaa un vivaadit faisle ko diferent karne ke liye majbootee se saamne aate dikhaai die
 This is the first time that the party has given tickets to some leaders and other big leaders of the party are unable to speak about this decision
 aam aadmi party kii ore se saurabh bharadwaj or aatishi marlena ko jimmedaari saunpi gai he ki vah media main aakar party ke is faisle kaa bachaav karen
 But the glowing mistrust in the face and the shaking mistrust is clear that there is neither consensus nor happiness among the party leaders with this decision of Kejriwal
 party ke kai vidhayakon se jab poocha gaya ki kya vah naamon ko jaanate hai to vah nadaan dikhaai die
 Many Aam Aadmi Party activists active on social media are not only surprised but disappointed by this decision
 haalanki guuruuvaar kii subah se party ke kai netaa or unke sakriy kaaryakarta kejariwal ke is faisle ke bachaav main khadey najar aae hai
 Many activists have also written on social media that every time a common man is accused of selling tickets by taking money on the party, but till date no evidence has been revealed
 kuch netaaon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kya bijepi jab duusari party se aae logon ko tikat detii he to kya media unase bhi sawaal puuchhati he? is bich aam aadmi party ne apane teenon rajyasabha ke ummidavaaron kaa biodata soshal media par jari karke unki mahanata kii prashansa karnaa shuru kar di he
 Even after all these developments, one thing that is clear is that in the Rajya Sabha candidates, apart from Sanjay Singh, neither the other leaders of the party are able to say anything with complete confidence and confidence and neither the supporters are able to digest these names
 Huh
 dabi jubaan party ke netaa maanate hai ki karpshan bhale naa hua ho lekin paracepshan kaa jo nuksaan party ko hua he uski bharpai aane vaale dinon main bahut mushkil he

 All the political parties of Delhi are eyeing the municipal corporation elections to be held in April
 ab tak yahaan bijepi or congress ke bich sidhi hoti thi lekin is baar chunavi maidan main sattadhari aam aadmi party or swaraj india pehali baar 272 siton par apni kismat aajamaate najar aaenge
 At the moment, leaving everyone behind, Swaraj India has won and started the nomination process for the selection of candidates
 swaraj india ke adhyaksh yogendra yadav ne daawa kiya he ki 272 siton ke liye ummidavaaron ko janata ke bich se hi chunaa jayega
 For this it will not be necessary to be a member of Swaraj India, any common citizen can become a candidate for Municipal Corporation election
 haalanki namakan farm bharne vaale har ummidavaar ko 3 tarah kii jaanch se guzarana hoga
 1
 screening cameti, jiske tahat ilaake ke log ummidavaar ke bare main padtaal karenge
 The committee will examine the image of the candidate and his hold among the public
 2
 Selection committee, Ajit Jha has been made the chairman of this committee, who will finalize the selection of candidates
 screening cameti se manjuuri milane ke baad ummidavaaron ko is prakriya ke tahat guzarana hoga

 Swaraj India has appointed Anjali Bhardwaj as chairman of the Integrity Committee consisting of 6 members
 agar ye cameti kisi ummidavaar kaa naam khaarij kar detii he to cameti kaa faisla nahin badla jayega
 Apart from this, the nomination form will also be shared on the party's website and social media
 ummidavaaron kii chayan prakriya ko lekar yogendra yadav ne aam aadmi party par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki aam aadmi party ne apane yahaan namakan prakriya ko sahi tareeke se lagu nahin kiya he
 While we were in the party, Professor Anand Kumar and i had made this process for 'AAP', but now the final check is in the hands of the internal people which is wrong
 yuvaaon ko denge praathamiktaswaraj india ke adhyaksh yogendra yadav ne aarope lagaaya ki kuch partiyaan main giroh sa ban gaya he, jo apane logon ko tikat dene kaa kaam karti hai
 Therefore, our party will try to give more and more tickets to the youth besides forming a search committee to find women leadership

 Who will win in the riots of Delhi will be known only after the counting of votes on Tuesday, but in the meantime, there is news that after the election results, there may be a ruckus in the Congress
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki agar dilli chunaav main congress harati he to ajay maakan party ke mahasachiv pad se istipha de denge
 In the exit poll results just after the vote, the condition of the Congress is being said to be worse than the last assembly election
 dilli main is baar congress ne ajay maakan ke netritv main chunaav ladaa he
 In such a situation, Maken says that whatever result will come, he is ready to take responsibility for it
 maakan ne kaha, 'main chunaav abhiyaan kaa prabharee tha, lihaaja jo bhi nateeja aayega uski sidhi jimmedaari meri hogi
 On the question of backing the Aam Aadmi Party again, Maken said that there is no question of Congress supporting AAP
 maakan ne kaha, 'agar agsit pole sahi nikalate hai to yah hamaare liye vichaar kaa prashn banataa he
 i think this will be an extension of the 2013 election results
 ho saktaa he log yah maanate hon ki aam aadmi party or kejariwal ko paanch saal kaa samay milanaa chahie

 We also have players who have already played

 Currently, Hiralal Raigar of BJP is the MLA on this seat
 bijepi ne apane gathan ke saath hi is ilaake main apni pakad majboot bana lee thi
 But later the Congress was successful in establishing its roots
 donon partiyaan paanch-paanch baar chunaav jitkar barabari par khadi hai
 In order to win the political bet this time, where the BJP wants to maintain its supremacy by replacing another face with the rager, the Congress is planning to bet on one of its old faces Prashant Bairwa and Kamal Bairama
 2013 ke nateezeybijapi ke heeralaal raigar ko 66764 vot milicongress ke prashanth bairava ko 60828 vot mili2008 ke parinaamcongress ke camel bairava ko 40105 vot milibijapi ke satish chandel ko 37667 vot mili2003 ke nateezeybijapi ke heeralaal ko 42561 vot milicongress ke banavaari laal bairava ko 41122 vot milinivai kaa siyaasi itihasanivaai vidhansabha seat 1962 main bani, tab se ab tak 13 baar vidhansabha chunaav hue hai

 sanjay dutt ne apni siyaasi pari shuru kar di
 Munnabhai said that Gandhigiri will be his electoral issue and only after being disappointed with Congress, he is associated with Samajwadi Party
 sanjay dutt ne ye bhi saaf kar diya ki yadi atal bihari vaajapeyi lakhanu se chunaav ladate hai to wo maidan chhod denge
 Sanjay Dutt said that i will not give a speech, i will speak my heart
 ab cinemawala siyasat main utrega to baat kii shuruyaat filmi andaaj main hogi hi
 Sanju Baba cleared many questions by showing respect for Atal ji
 lekin chunaav ladane main jo sabase bada sawaal unke saamne khadaa he uskaa zikr munna bhai ne bade nape tule lahaze main kiya
 Cited the father's wishes and tried to touch the hearts of people somewhere
 sanjay ne kaha ki wo antkavaadi nahin hai
 He said that my father would be very happy when he came to know that his son is not a terrorist and Tada has withdrawn from me
 sanjay dutt ne congress ko lekar kaha ki pitaaji ke guzar jane ke baad mujhe laga bahut badi party mere saath he lekin phir bhi mujhe akelaapan mahasoos hua
 Munna bhai dil ki jaheen hai dil ki hai or elder brother Amar Singh ji's Sanju Baba would tell it better but if the matter is finished, Amar Singh also made Munnabhai's circuit political
 gujarat chunaav sir par he or sabhi dalon ne apane tarkash se saare siyaasi tir nikaal liye hai
 Congress on one side trying to end Modi's Gujarat exile on the other side
 lekin is baar seen kaaphi badla hua he
 Especially for the Congress
 modi gujarat main nahin he or ab desh kii satta par asin hai congress 2019 ke liye gujarat ko semifinal ke taur par dekh rahi he
 In such a situation, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi took the front
 gujarat kaa chunaav aise vakt main ho rahaa he jab 2019 kaa chunaav kareeb he, rahul gandhi kii congress adhyaksh ke rup main tajposhi honi he or rojgaar-iconomi samet kai muddon modi sarkaar katghare main he
 Rahul Gandhi made Gujarat his launch pad and landed in the ground
 gujarat main ab tak rahul gandhi 4 navasrujan yatraaen kar chuke hai
 Typical Gujarati style, darshan of temples, food at dhabas, discussion at tea shops, meetings with workers, interactions with elders, farmers and selfies with youth are some of the changed looks of Rahul Gandhi in Gujarat
 vyapak taur pe dekha jaae to rahul gandhi ne congress kii kaman sanbhaalane se pehle chaar tarah ke prayog kiye or iske liye gujarat ko test ground banaaya:1
 In Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi's cut of Modi's trump card was betrayed on the ethnic card, which left the Congress more or less marginalized in the 2014 elections
 yani hindu card kaa jawaab jaateey card se
 The most difficult thing for BJP is that it does not like caste politics
 bihar kaa vidhansabha chunaav iskaa udaahaaran he
 RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav lashed the BJP by narrowing the Bihar assembly elections around caste
 yahi vajah he ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bihar kii tarj par gujarat ke siyaasi ran ko jeetne ke liye jaateey card khelaa he
 Rahul Gandhi has patronized the Patidar, OBC, and Dalit and tribal votes in Gujarat
 in teenon samaaj ke maton ko dekhen to kareeb 70 fisadi se upar kii hissedari he
 In view of this, Rahul had invited Trinity Alpesh, Jignesh and Hardik from the caste movement in Gujarat to come together
 rahul kii koshish safal bhi hui
 While Alpesh joined the Congress, Jignesh and Hardik announced their support
 congress ke jaateey card se bijepi main bechaini badi he
 Narendra Modi had to say in Gujarat that do not fall under the pretext of casteism, caste issues will hamper the development of the country

 Breaking the anti-hindu image, Rahul Gandhi from Gujarat is also trying to respond to allegations of 'anti-hindu' and 'appeasement of minorities' by the BJP on the Congress party
 darasal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress kii haar kii ek badi vajah antni cameti ne hindu virdohi chhavi maani thi
 Rahul has tried to break the anti-hindu image of the Congress through the Gujarat Yatra
 rahul gandhi ne navasajrun yatra kii shuruuaat saurashtra ke dwarkadhish mandir main puja-archana ke saath kii
 Rahul Gandhi is on the path of soft Hindutva in Gujarat
 muslim bahul ilaakon main honi vaali reliyon main rahul ke saath sant mahant manch par najar aate hai
 When Rahul's convoy goes ahead, he does not stop at any mosque falling on the way and does not bow his head
 jabaki vahiin rahul gujarat main apni chaaron yatraaon ke dauraan maathe par tilak lagaae or raste main padane vaali mandiron ke darshan or maathaa tekte hue guzarate
 Rahul has visited all the major temples of Gujarat
 rahul kaa twitor account mandiron main darshan vaale unke photo se bharaa padaa he
 Rahul also teaches the Mahabharata in Gujarat, saying that Lord Krishna went to meet Duryodhana on behalf of the Pandavas and asked for only 5 villages
 duryodhana ne jawaab diya sui kii nok baraabar bhi jameen nahin duungaa
 Even then there was a fight between truth and untruth, even today the fight is between truth and untruth
 rahul ke mandiron main maathaa techne se bijepi baichaiyn he or unke mandiron main jane par bhi sawaal uthaa rahi he
 Rahul says in response, he is a devotee of Shiva

 People's Connection: In Gujarat, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi appeared in a new tone and new style
 rahul ne gujarat yatra ke dauraan janata ke saath sidhe samvaad karne kii koshish kii
 Rahul was seen making everyone agree on every question, accusation and his talk
 rahul kii reliyon main pehle se zyada bheed bhi jute rahi he
 When Rahul talks about the tribals' problem, he calls a tribal youth to give a speech on the stage
 usko hindi nahin aati to rahul kehete hai tum bolo main kisi or se translet karke samaj luungaa or tumhaara saath duungaa
 Rahul goes among people to take selfies
 usamen buudhe jawan sab hote hai par bacchon kaa khaas khyaal rakhte hai, lekin ahm baat hoti he kii ilaake main parampara kya he parampara ke tahat vah adivaasiyon ke mor pankh ke bich khadey hote hai photo khinchaate hai koshish karte hai unase apnaapan ho jaae
 After finishing the political campaign of the day, Rahul, wearing his blue t-shirt in the style of the young man, arrives at an area's dhaba and tastes Gujarati food

 2019 Agenda Set Kiarahul Gandhi has set the 2019 agenda from the political land of Gujarat
 rahul jin muddon ko gujarat main uthaa rahe hai ve mudde 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi unke kaam aaenge
 Rahul is meeting and interacting with businessmen, youth, farmers in Gujarat and is directly targeting the Modi government for his interest
 rahul gandhi ne gujarat me navasrujan yatra ke dauraan berogari ko sabase bada mudda banaaya he
 If the Modi government was surrounded by GST, the government had to cut the GST rates
 rahul kisaanon kii haalat bhi bayaan kar rahe hai
 Gujarat ranks 9th in terms of farmer suicides
 aaj desh main kisaanon kii haalat kaaphi dayaneey he
 Rahul is not going to answer these issues on BJP
 yaheen kaaran he bijepi ab rahul kii ranneeti kii kaat khojane main juty hui or pradhanmantri modi samet 10 se adhik kendriya mantriyon ko gujarat chunaav prachaar main utaarne kii taiyaari he
 This time in many areas of North India including Delhi, there is no harsh winter
 is samay kii baat karen to disambar khatm hone ja rahaa he or janvari kii shuruuaat hone ja rahi he lekin puure ilaake se ghanaa koharaa puri tarah se nadaarad he
 The whole North India will remain low cold weather, the situation of this strange puzzle is that in Himachal, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh, Saurashtra, Kutch and Rajasthan, the temperature is being recorded 2 to 5 degrees Celsius above normal
 Huh
 rajdhani dilli kii baat karen to yahaan par nunatam taapmaana saamaanya ke mukaable 5 degree celsius upar darj kiya gaya he
 The Meteorological Department estimates that there will be no significant change in the weather till the beginning of January in the capital Delhi
 yani dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main paare main jabardast giravat kii koi sambhaavna nahi he or din main dhoop khili rahegikhili dhoop kaa ye najaara ganga-yamuna ke tamaam maidani ilaakon main bana rahegaa
 Experts say that this time the monsoon rains were less in North India and at the same time there has been negligible rainfall in these areas, so there is a huge lack of moisture in the soil
 aise main taapmaana main giravat kii sambhaavna na hone kii vajah se maidani ilaakon main zyaadaatar jagahon par koharaa nadaarad he
 That is, the new year is going to knock between the sunshine and the rising temperature in the winter months
 sardi ke maheenon main is baar us tarah kii thand nahin pad rahi he jaisi ki amuman is samay padati he
 The biggest reason behind this is being told that weak Western disturbances are coming again and again
 kamjor western disterbence jammu-kashmir aurahimachal ke oonchai valeilaakon main hi barfbaari dete hai
 Therefore, the plain area is completely untouched by their cold
 thandi hawaaon kii bajaae in kamjor western disterbenson ke chalate maidani ilaakon main taapmaana upar chadh jate hai
 On 31 December, one such weak Western Disturbance is going to knock in Kashmir
 isaki vajah se kashmir main oonchai vaale ilaakon main 31 disambar or 1 janvari ko halki barfbaari kii sambhaavna he
 But due to weak western disturbances, most of the places in North India will be sunny on the new year

 The then District Primary Education Officer Madan Lal Kalra, Durga Dutt Pradhan, the then principal of a government girl school, Bani Saini, the then principal of a government school, and Daya Saini, the then assistant primary education director, were also sentenced to 10 years in prison
 sajaa sunaae jane ke kuch hi samay baad chautaala samarthakon ne adaalat parisar main patharav kiya
 The judge refused to accept the plea that due to the poor health of the accused, leniency should be exercised at the time of sentencing
 unhone kaha, "dushtapurna aparaadh or rajaneta va naukarshah ke bich santhganth se bahut saare abhyarthiyon ke sanvaidhanik adhikaar ke hanan vaale is maamle par vichaar karne ke baad mujhe doshiyon ko sajaa sunaane main udaartaa baratane kaa koi kaaran najar nahin aata
 The culprits conspired in a vicious manner or supported those who committed such acts
 " The court also refused to be lenient to the then officer Sanjeev Kumar, who exposed the case
 kumaar baad main swayan is ghotaale main sanlipt paae gaye
 Like other convicts, he was also sentenced to 10 years in prison on the basis of equality of crime
 adaalat ne haalanki yah rekhaankit kiya ki sunwaayee ke dauraan in doshiyon ne jo kaha, sach kaha
 Both Chautala and his son Ajay are mlas from Haryana

 The court prima facie found evidence against Chautala and 53 others
 sibiai ne chah june, 2008 ko chautaala tathaa anya ke khilaaf aupchaarik taur par aarope tay kiya tha
 The case dates back to 1999 and 2000, when Chautala was the Chief Minister of Haryana
 us dauraan rajya main 3,000 se adhik shikshakon kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 It is alleged that Chautala pressurized senior officer Sanjeev Kumar to change the list of selected candidates and to add the names of some wanted candidates to it on the basis of false facts
 baad main sanjeev kumaar sarvocch nyaayalay gaye or unhone mul rup se chaynit abhyarthiyon kii suchi adaalat ke samaksh pesh kii

 pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or tiemasi kii adhyaksh mamata banerjee dwaara kolkata main sanyukt bharat raily main vipakshi ekta kaa najaara dikhaa
 During this period, the Modi government at the center was targeted by the leaders of about 20 opposition parties and talked about defeating the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 kolkata ke brigade parade maidan main rajd netaa or lalu prasad yadav ke bete tejasvi yadav (tejashwi Yadav) mamata banerjee (mamata Banerjee) kii rail main kaaphi der se pahunche
 However, before this, Mamata Banerjee herself kept announcing from the stage that Tejashwi has not come yet but he will definitely come
 magar der se hi sahi tejasvi yadav raily main pahunche or jab manch par bolne kaa mauka mila to unhone modi sarkaar or piem modi ko aade haathon liya
 In addition, he also told people the reason for being late in TMC rally
 manch se tejasvi ne aate hi sabase pehle logon ko abhivadan kiya or der se aane kii vajah bataai
 Tejashwi Yadav, who arrived late in Mamta's rally, said that "we were delayed because Modi and Amit Shah were kind to us
" unki vajah se ham aane main der ho gaye, agar unase samjhauta kar lo, aapane unase haath mila liya to aapaki ginati raja harishchandra main hogi lekin agar aapane unase sawaal puche or unke vaade ginaoge, ladane kaa kaam karoge, desh ko jodne kaa kaam karoge, sampradayik shaktiyon ke saamne ghutana nahin tekoge, to idi or sibiai jo unke alliance partner hai, unke sahyog se vah aapako dabaane kaa kaam karegaa, magar ham darane vaale nahin hai
 Our father was sent to jail under the conspiracy, but we did not act as a whimper, we have to save the country
 mamata banerjee ne bengal main jo kaman thaamne kaa kaam kiya he, yahaan bengal main jo aapane unhen munh tod jawaab diya he, uske liye ham apane or pita kii taraf se aapako dhanyavad detaa hum
 "further, Tejashwi Yadav said that" You people say no in Bengal "fight, Karbo and Jeetbo Re
 
 
 ' bihari main kahen to 'ladeke ba, kare ke ba
 
 
 After winning 
 'therefore, all people need to be united
 yahaan baat chaukeedaar kii ho rahi thi, to ham bataa den ki agar modi ji aap chaukeedaar hai to is desh kii janata thanedaar he
 If you do not do your work properly then the Sho will punish you
 agar chaukeedaari main galati kii he to thanedaar aapako bakhshane kaa kaam karegaa, aapako sajaa degaa
 In a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a rally of opposition parties organized by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee here, Yadav described him as a "producer, wholesaler and distributor of lies"
 unhone aage kaha ki modi ji jhooth kii factory hai, jhooth ke hole celler hai or distributor bhi hai
 After a few days, he will come to Kolkata, then lie, then show dreams but this time you are not stuck in it
 bihar ke logon ko modi ji ne dhokhaa diya he, sava lakh karod kaa package kaa vaada karke bhul gaye
 So now the time has come that we all have to compete together
 or is desh kii satta se bijepi ko baahar nikaalnaa he
 He praised Banerjee for bringing the leaders of the opposition on one platform and requested all the leaders to stand together to keep the BJP out of power
 tejasvi yadav ne kaha ki mamata hameshaa “dukh-sukh” main unke pita (lalu prasad) ke saath khadi raheen hai or bengal main rah rahe bihar ke logon se anurodh kiya ki ise dhyaan main rakhte hue unki raajnneetik ladaai ko majbootee den

 The Congress has agreed to support the JDS, which has got half of its seats to stop the BJP in Karnataka, and make its leader Kumaraswamy the CM
 haalanki, yah nirnay aasaan nahin tha, iske liye do mahilaon kii bhoomika kaaphi ahm rahi
 Since the trend came on Tuesday, the movement of Congress veterans increased significantly
 diene akhbaar ke anusaar, kahani main nayaa mode aayaa sonia gandhi ke aadhikarik awaas 10 janpath par hui ek meeting main
 After the trend, Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra immediately reached Sonia Gandhi's residence
 kumaraswami ko CM pad ofer karne kaa kisne diya suzav!akhbaar ne sutron ke hawaale se bataaya ki yah suzav priyanka gandhi kaa tha ki rahul gandhi jedies netaa kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri pad ofer karen
 It was not easy to present this proposal, because JDS has only half the seats than the Congress
 is meeting main maujuud netaaon ke man main is baat ko lekar uhapoh thi ki rahul gandhi agar gathbandhan ke liye phone karenge to echdi devgauda kis tarah kaa jawaab denge
 In fact, during the election campaign, Rahul Gandhi had repeatedly denied any alliance with the JDS and in his speeches many times he also described the JDS as the bjp's b team
 sonia gandhi ne sabase pehle gulam nabi aaazaad se baat kii, jinhone devgauda or kumaraswami ko apane samvaad sutara bheje
 Sonia Gandhi herself spoke to Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy after receiving a positive message from Ghulam Nabi Azad
 sonia ne yah ehtiyaat bartaa ki rahul gandhi kii bajaay khud jedies netaaon se baat kii, kyonki devgauda ek varisht netaa hai or shaayad rahul gandhi kii baatcheet se vah asar nahin hota
 The Congress had earlier said that if Karnataka gets more than 100 seats, it will form the government on its own and if the seats fall less than this, then other options can be considered
 is tarah sonia gandhi ke phone ke baad gend devgauda ke paale main chali gai
 Subsequently in Bengaluru, where things were rapidly changing, the Congress announced that it was ready to form the government with the JDS and make Kumaraswamy the Chief Minister
 sonia phir hongi sakriy!karnataka main jedies ko manaane ke liye jis tarah se sonia gandhi ne khud phone kiya, usase jaankaar yah bhi akalan kar rahe hai ki aage sonia gandhi ko phir sakriy hona padegaa
 The reason for this is that Rahul Gandhi's stature has not yet become such that he can talk to the opposition leaders and even the leaders of the opposition are not ready to accept him as their equal
 sonia shaayad ab yah sanket dene ko bhi taiyaar hai ki bijepi ko haraane ke liye congress junior partner banane ko taiyaar he

 When i talk about climate change, back to basic, i would like to say in particular - Yoga is our ancient traditional invaluable gift

 Through this, we will be helpful in fighting climate change by changing lifestyle
 ” pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley saal 27 sitambar ko sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main yoga ko antarrashtriya diwas ke rup main badhaane kii apil kii thi, tab aayush mantralay (nodel body) ko andaja nahin tha ki log iske prati itane utsahit honge
 For the June 21 international event, the Ministry of AYUSH had first made 35,000 and later two thousand T-shirts and yoga mats, but the demand came so much that it was not possible to meet it in such a short time
 mantralay main yoga diwas aayojan kaa kaamkaaj dekh rahe sanyukt sachiv anil ganerywala india today se kehete hai, “2-3 maheene pehle hamane sochaa bhi nahin tha ki aayojan main bhaag lene ke liye logon kaa utsaah is kadar hoga
 "the government gave all the strength to make this event a success
 prati enjio ek lakh ru
 Amount given
 kendriya yoga evam prakritik chikitsa anusandhan parishad ke nideshak dow
 God n
 acharya bataate hai ki enjio ko di gai ek lakh ru
 The amount will be continued next year also
 antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke aayojan par akele parishad ne 6
 5 crores Rs
 kharch kiye to kendriya aayush mantri shripad yesso nik ke mutabik puure aayojan kaa kul kharch 25 se 30 karod ru
 It is estimated to be between yoga par dharmik vivaad ke baad bhi bade rujhaanon ne sarkaar kii ummiido ko nai udaan di he
 On the cultural front, Prime Minister Modi, who won the heart of the Sangh Parivar by making Yoga a big worldwide identity, now seems to be working on a plan to make Yoga an industry as well
 yoga main mek in india kaa tadakapahale antarrashtriya yoga diwas ko safal banane main juty modi sarkaar ne abhi bahut zyada homework nahin kiya he, lekin uski ranneeti yoga ko ek industry ke rup main khadaa karne kii he
 After international recognition, the demand for yoga-related universities, colleges, yoga instructors, essential materials for yoga, mat-dress, etc
 is increasing
 ganerywala kehete hai, “yoga ke nae sire se focus main aane se aayush mantralay kii jimmedaari bhi badhegi
 As Yoga has become a separate industry in America, the possibility of the same industry is now visible in India as well
 ” ek anumaan ke mutabik america main yoga industry kareeb 27 arab dollar kii ho chuki he, jabaki yoga kii jaden bharat main hai
 India is the second largest country in the export of Ayurvedic and other alternative medicines
 isse nishchit taur se is kaarobaar main badhotaree hogi or bharat ko is lihaaj se taiyaari bhi kerani hogi
 Although Dr
 acharya kehete hai, “bharat main yoga kabhi industry ke rup main viksit nahin hua he or yoga diwas kii manyata ke baad udyog kii bajaae mujhe lagata he ki prashikshit or kushal main power badhegi, saath hi rojgaar ke avasar paidaa honge
 The council is setting up 6 central institutes for yoga
 isamen se do abhi pipeline main hai to karnataka, haryana main nirmaan kaary chal rahaa he, jabaki bhubaneshwar main jameen lene kii prakriya jari he
 The first such institute is ready in Rohini, Delhi and OPD facility has been started
 saath hi har santhaan main marijon ko bhartee karne ke lihaaj se kam se kam 100 bistar taiyaar kiye jaaenge
 The Council also seeks to link these institutions with international institutions
 vivaad ke baavjood aage badhegi sarkaryog diwas par asana ko lekar jamkar rajnatik bayaanbaji hui
 But the government does not want to weaken its agenda by getting caught in some kind of controversy
 yoga ko 177 deshonke jabardast samarthan se antarrashtriya diwas ke rup main manyata milane se sangh parivaar modi se khush he
 International General Secretary of Vishwa Hindu Parishad Champat Rai argued, "what Yoga means, Modi has told the world in just a few days
" ”ab sarkaar yoga ko skool paathyakram kaa hissaa banane kii disha main aage bad rahi he
 Naik says, "our intention is to incorporate yoga into the curriculum
 hamen yah karnaa he, lekin antim faisla cameti kii sifarish ke mutabik karenge
 "but according to sources, the intention of the government is to make yoga compulsory in Physical Education (PT) before being included in the syllabus
 iske liye aayush mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ko chitthee likhi he
 At the same time, the government is working towards including yoga in army, police and paramilitary forces
 jaahir he ki modi sarkaar ne yoga ke madhyam se dohare agenda par kadam aage badha die hai
 The CBI has started the investigation of the Samajwadi Party government's Dream Project Gomti River Front scam in Uttar Pradesh

 The CBI has now registered a case in this case and has started investigation

 Despite complaints, the work was not completed, after which investigation started, according to the allegations, the officials and engineers played fiercely in scamming the amount received in the project

 buudhvaar ko sharaab kaarobaariwijay maalyane kaha ki unhone bharat chhodane se pehlgarun jetalise mulaakaat kii thi
 Now Congress President Shahul Gandhi held a press conference on this issue on Thursday
 rahul pehle hi twit kar arun jetali kystifamang chuke hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that on Wednesday, Arun Jaitley said that Vijay Mallya had met him informally in Parliament
 vah lambey blog likhte hai, lekin is bare main kuch nahin likhte
 Arun Jaitley is lying about the meeting
 is dauraan unhone saathi netaa piel puniya kii baat kahi, ki unhone donon ko baat karte hue dekha tha
 Rahul said that we have proof
 piel puniya ne bataaya ki bajet pesh hone ke agle din 1 march ko arun jetali or vijay maalya baat kar rahe the
 He kept talking for about 15-20 minutes, first both were standing and talking and after that both of them started talking in the Central Hall
 jab maine do din ke baad hi padhaa ki maalya ravaanaa ho gaye hai, to main hairaan tha
 He said that we want that the CCTV footage of the Parliament should be investigated, its truth will be revealed
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne kaha ki isapar kai tarah ke sawaal uthte hai kivitt mantriek bhagode se baat karte hai, or bhagoda unhen bataata he ki vah desh chhod rahaa he
 But the Finance Minister neither told the police, nor told the CBI
 iske baad lukout notice main bhi dheel di gai thi
 Jaitley must tell the truth and tell that he is responsible for this, or that he is getting orders from above
 rahul ne kaha ki vitt mantri ko turant istipha dena chahie
 The Congress president alleged that only the Finance Minister and the Prime Minister can change the lookout notice
 vitt mantri ne vijay maalya ko bhaagane diya
 Earlier, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had sought the resignation of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley after Mallya's statement on Thursday
 unhone twit kar kaha ki maalya kii ore se lagaae gaye aarope behad gambhir hai or piem ko tatkaal is maamle kii nishpaksh jaanch karaani chahie
 Rahul said that Arun Jaitley should resign from the post of finance minister till the investigation is complete
 Given Vijay Mallya’s extremely serious allegations in London today, the PM should immediately order an independent probe into the matter
 Arun Jaitley should step down as finance Minister while this probe is underway
 — Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi)september 12, 2018maalya ne diya tha ye bayaan
 
 
 Vijay Mallya said on Wednesday that he had met the Finance Minister before leaving for India
 landan main westminster magistrate kii adaalat main pesh hone ke liye pahunche maalya ne kaha ki usne mantri se mulaakaat kii thi or bainkon ke saath maamle kaa nipataara karne kii peshkash kii thi
 Arun Jaitley gave clarification
 
 
 arun jetali ne fasebuk par is sambandh main safai dete hue kaha, 'maalya kaa daawa tathyaatmak rup se galat he
 i have not given him time to meet him since 2014
 vah rajyasabha sadsy the or kabhi-kabhi sadan main aayaa karte the
 i was leaving the house and going to my room, during this time they joined
 unhone samjhaute kii peshkash kii thi, jis par maine unhen rokte hue kaha ki mere saath baat karne kaa koi phayda nahin, yah prastaav bainkon ke saath karen

 According to the report of the Cancer Research Unit of the World Health Organization (WHO), drinking normal coffee is not a risk of cancer
 dablyuechao ne 1991 main coffee ko mutrashay ke cancer kaa khatra badhaane vaala bataaya tha
 But after reviewing more than 1,000 studies, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has removed it from the list of things that consume cancer
 haalanki agar bahut garm coffee pi jaae to usase cancer kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 The Cancer Research Unit of WHO says that drinking coffee over 65 degrees Celsius can increase the risk of cancer
