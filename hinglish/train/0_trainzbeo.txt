 The film Udta Punjab, which was surrounded in controversies, has now taken that political color, in which more talk than the release of the film has got entangled over the fight between the leaders and political parties
 punjab main nashe ke daldal main fanse yuvaaon par aadhaarit udata punjab par sensor kii kanchi se bhadke anuraag kashyap or central board of film certificate yani siefbisi ke diarector pehlaaj nihlani ke bich chal rahe aarope aag main ghi daal rahe hai
 But before the elections in Punjab next year, it is clear that to what extent the issue of drugs will take political color in the state
 punjab shabd se shuru hua vivadadrasal apane naam or kahani ko lekar yahfilm relies se pehle hi kaaphi charchaa menthi
 After the censor board, the appeals tribunal ordered the word Punjab to be removed from the film and controversy erupted
 anuraag kashyap ne kaha kii soochna or prasaaran mantralay ko dakhal dena chahie or wo is baat se niraash hai ki mantri unki sunwaayee nahin kar rahe
 In response, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Rathore said that the film makers have the right to go to the tribunal as the ministry or the government has nothing to do with it
 lekin chunaav se thik 8 maheene pehle relies ke liye ataki udata punjab ko vivaadon main ghirna hi tha kyonki film kii theme yani rajya main nashe kii lat wo mudda he jise aam aadmi party or congress sattadhari akali bijepi ke khilaaf istemaal karti rahi he
 Government sources are also not denying that the fight over the film is political now
 sutron kaa kahana he ki nashe kii samasya sirf punjab hi nahin balki puure bharat main he isliye sirf punjab ko centre main rakhkar film bananaa sahi nahin he
 The central government cannot give political parties who have come out in support of the intervention film are blaming the central government and the ministry for the entire controversy
 lekin 'mail today' ke haath lage supreme court ke 28 / 11 / 2000 ke faisle par najar daale to ye saaf hota he ki centre sarkaar ko kisi bhi film main cat lagane yaa relies kaa haq hi nahin he
 This is the responsibility of CBFC
 court ke union of india varses keem shankarappa aadesh main saaf kaha gaya he ki agar film ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak sibiefasi ke faisle se khush na ho to wo tribunel main apil kar sakate hai, or sarkaar bhi tribunel ke die faisle ko maanane ke liye baadhya he
 The judgment states that the government also has to follow judicial orders in the constitution
 agar tribunel main baithe jaankaar koi faisla karte hai to use maananaa padataa he
 By citing this decision, the government has overthrown the entire matter, but it is not visible at the moment that politics will end

 yachika main sheersh adaalat ke anek faislon kaa hawala diya gaya he jinamein maut kii sajaa paane vaale kaidi ko faansee par latakaane ke tareeke kii aalochana kii gayi he
 Hanging in the law also means to keep the culprit and bayonet criminal hanging on the noose till the last breath breaks
 adaalat jab kisi doshi ko faansee kii sajaa sunaati he to kahati he'hang til deth', jiskaa matlab hi hota he doshi ko tab tak faansee par latakaaya jaae jab tak uske sharir main praan baaki he
 Amendments have also been sought in this law filed in the Supreme Court

 The Supreme Court on Thursday slammed the Sahara group for not taking it lightly
 sahaara samooh ne vibhinn akhabaaron main vigyaapan jari kar bazaar niamak sebi par 'sarkari gunda' banane kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 SEBI is taking steps against Sahara for not giving refund of Rs 20,000 crore to investors
 nyaayadhish kees radhakrishnan tathaa je es khehar kii peeth ne sahaara ke us vigyaapan ko gambhirtha se liya he jisamen samooh ne sebi dwaara 'sandigdhon kii khoj' kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The court has asked Sahara to publish sorry in the same newspapers
 peeth ne kaha, 'ham is sab ko bahut gambhirtha se lenge
 Do not take us lightly
 aapako isse kuch hasil hone vaala nahin he, aap samajhen ki aap avagya kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Such actions will make matters worse
 vah (sebi) sanvidhik praadhikaar he jo apane kartavya nibhaa rahaa he or hamaare adeshon kaa paalan kar rahaa he
 What is this?' sahaara samooh kii ore se aaye vakil ne is maamle main tatkaal maafee maangi
 Meanwhile, the Sahara Group has agreed to provide documents related to its 71 properties as security or bail to Sebi
 samooh kaa daawa he ki in sampattiyon kaa mulya 20,000 karod rupee he
 The court, however, dismissed Sahara's plea that its chief Subrata Roy be allowed to travel abroad
 nyaayalay ne sebi ko dastavej nahin saunpane ke kaaran subrat raay par pratibandh lagaaya tha
 The court said, 'this situation would not have happened if you had followed our orders, handed over documents to SEBI and given resources for refunds
 is lucatipi se aapako kuch nahin milane vaala
 ' sahaara samooh chahta he ki raay par 21 november ko lagaaya gaya yatra pratibandh samaapt kar diya jaye
 The group said that it has submitted title deeds (ownership documents) of 71 properties to SEBI
 nyaayalay ne in dastavejon ke satyaapan ke liye sebi ko samay diya he or maamle kii agali sunwaayee 9 janvari ko tay kii he
 The court also rejected Sahara's plea seeking removal of the bank accounts of his group companies
 sahaara samooh kaa kahana he ki jin sampattiyon ke dastavej die gaye hai ve mumbai, kochi, noida, ajmer, aligarh, haridwar, mujffarnagar, raipur, amritsar, jhaansi, kanpur va faridabad main hai
 The West Bengal Lokayukta Amendment Bill 2018 has received approval from the state legislature on 23 July
 yah kanoon mukhyamantri ko lokayukta kii jaanch ke daayre se baahar rakhata he
 According to the Gazette issued by the state government, this amendment "excludes complaints of corruption related to public order against the Chief Minister from the purview of investigation and investigation of complaint against any public official will not be possible without the approval of the state government
" ''2003 main tatkaaleen buddhadev bhattacharya sarkaar dwaara laae gaye mul lokayukta act main mukhyamantri ko aisi koi raahat nahin di gai thi, haalanki usamen bhi mukhyamantri ke liye ek dhaal kii vyavastha jarur kii gai thi
 It said that approval from the "appropriate authority" would have to be taken to investigate complaints of misuse of office against the Chief Minister or other ministers and public servants
 jaise, mukhyamantri ke maamle main vidhansabha ke do-tihaai bahumat kii manjuuri or mantriyon ke maamle main vidhansabha ke spikar kii manjuuri
 Leaders of the Left Front have started raising their voice against Mamata's new amendment
 vammorcha vidhayak dal ke netaa sujan chakrabarti ne kaha, "yah (mukhyamantri ko chhot) bhedbhaav he or bhrasht logon ko bachane kaa rasta muhaiyaa karata he
 Responding to the debate in the Legislative Assembly, Mamata Banerjee said that she is exempted only in the matter of "public order", whose scope is very limited
 unhone kaha, "rajya suchi ke anya vishay lokayukta ke daayre main aate hai
 "responding to the allegations of the opposition, the Chief Minister said," You think this is a weak bill
 
 
 to jab aap sarkaar main aaiega, apni jaruraton ke hisaab se isamen badlaav kar lijiega
 "but according to the current law, in addition to" public order ", the Lokayukta will have to get the approval of two-thirds majority of the assembly to investigate any allegations of corruption on the Chief Minister
 vipaksh isse kaaphi khafa he
 State BJP president Dilip Ghosh asks, "the Chief Minister describes herself as a symbol of honesty, so why do she want to protect herself by getting an exemption through these reforms?" The passage is in accordance with the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013, in which similar exemptions have been granted to Prime Ministers
 trinmul congress sarkaar kii swasthya mantri chandrima bhattacharya ne bhi centre sarkaar ke act ke mutabik mukhyamantri ko mili chhot ko nyyochit tehraane kii koshish kii
 Congress leader Abdul Mannan justifies the exclusion of Prime Ministers by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from the purview of Lokpal
 kolkata main to yah atakalein tej ho gayi hai ki kya yah kadam mamata banerjee ko sharada or naarad jaise vittiya ghotaalon kii jaanch ke daayre se baahar rakhane kii koshish he (jail main band sharada ke pramukh sudipto ne mamata kii painting ascharyajanak keemat main kharidi thi)
 But the Chief Minister emphasizes, "only the public can question my credibility
 '' congress ke gandhi parivaar ko nishane par lete hue unhone kaha ki rajeev gandhi ke samay koi lokapal nahin tha, phir bhi ve boforce kii jaanch se batch nahin sake
 Eventually, despite all the uproar, this amendment bill was passed by an overwhelming majority
 haalanki, kai log ise ab bhi "kamajori'' kaa sanket maanate hai
 Is Mamata Banerjee afraid of shaking the foundations of her party? *** jamaat-e-ulema-e-hind ne narendra modi kii raily main bees hajaar musalamaanon ke saath samarthan dene kaa daawa kiya he
 On Friday, the Jamaat also wanted to rally in Turkman Gate area but the police did not allow it
 jamaat kaa kahana he ki wo congress ke dushprachaar ko jhuthalaanaa chaahate hai ki musalmaan bijepi ke saath nahin hai
 The meeting of jamaat-e-ulema-e-hind's ulema started at the national anthem at bjp's state headquarters 14 Pantmarg
 pehle vande maataram gaanaa tay hua tha lekin us par sahmati nahin bani
 In this meeting, Vijender Gupta and Vijay Goyal were also supposed to come but only Vijay Jolly came
 baharhaal, jamaat-e-ulema-e-hind ke adhyaksh moulana suhaib kaasmi ne baithak main daawa kiya ki congress ne pichley 65 saalon se desh ko chalaa he or iskaa khamiyaja use aane vaale chunaavon main bhugatna hoga
 Maulana said that he wanted to rally at Turkman Gate and give a message of unity among Muslims, but the Congress pressured the police not to allow them
 jamaat-e-ulema-e-hind ke adhyaksh moulana suhaib kaasmi ne kaha turkman get par ham raily karnaa chaahate the lekin vahaan vidhayak or saansad donon congress ke hai or unhone hamen raily nahin karne di
 We will reach out to 20 to 25 thousand Muslim brothers and support Narendra Modi
 'ulimaon ke saath baithak main rajya bijepi kaa bhi koi bada padaadhikari nahin tha
 Vijendra Gupta was scheduled to come first but he did not come
 baithak main pahunch vijay joli ne kaha ki unki party musalamaanon samet puure samaaj ko saath lekar chalane kaa sandesh de rahi he
 BJP leader Vijay Jolly said, 'we are supportive of taking all the people of the society along and we want to convey this message in Modi ji's rally as well
 'masjidon main parche baant rahi he bjpmoxi kii raily main musalamaanon ko jutaney ke liye party rajdhani kii kareeb 100 masjidon main parche bhi baant rahi he
 To address the doubts of Muslims about Modi, the party has published special leaflets in which a list of big riots in the country has been issued since 1947
 kya likhaa he parche mendilli bijepi ke alpsankhyak morche ke adhyaksh aatif rashid ne bhi daawa kiya he ki raily main 20,000 se zyada musalmaan jutenge
 Rashid said, 'the Muslim community raised questions about the Godhra riots but we have answered them in the leaflet that there have been thousands of communal riots in the country since independence
 isamen gujarat kii maujuuda sthiti or vahaan ke musalamaanon kii aarthik sthiti ke bare main bhi bataaya gaya he
 He told that 340 buses have been deployed from Muslim dominated areas to bring people to the rally

 Government relief camps for flood victims in eastern Uttar Pradesh are giving them more pain than relief
 baadh main sab kuch ganvaakar raahat campon main aae baliya jile ke baadh peediton kaa dard kuch alag hi he
 When the Aaj Tak team reached a relief camp in the area, they were stunned to see that the flood victims were not even getting food in the relief camps
 pani ke tanker main mila jonksarkaar kii taraf se bheje gaye pani ke tanker main logon ko jonk mil rahe hai, jiske baad logon ne sarkari pani pinaa chhod diya he or khud hi khaanaa banaakar kha rahe hai
 Government relief camps have been built, but people are eating their food either by buying or making
 alam ye he ki sarkaar kaa bharosa chhodkarrahat shiviron memlogon ne khud hi khaanaa bananaa shuru kar diya he
 Many relief camps have been set up on NH-31
 Around 25 km from Balshihar, many relief camps have been set up on NH-31, in which when the 'aaj Tak' team reached the relief camp in Dubhur area, they saw the situation of the flood victims
 Stunned that there is no one to wipe the tears of the flood victims, people have started cooking on their own in relief camps for starving children and families
 khud hi khaanaa kharid rahe hai lograhat camp main khaanaa kha rahe ek parivaar ke paas jab 'aaj tak' kii team pahunchi, to pataa chalaa is parivaar ne apane paise se rashan kharida he or khud hi khaanaa banaakar kha rahe hai kyonki prashasan ne unhen yahaan pahunchaakar apni itishree kar lee he or inhen poochne vaala koi nahin he
 There is no food nor water in the camp, there is no pain in the eyes of the women, the house is drowning in the raging Ganges several kilometers away, so there is neither food nor water in the relief camp
 isi raahat shivi main maujuud rajbhar raay ne baaltee main rakhaa wo pani bhi dikhaaya, jisamen jonk tair rahaa he
 The water was from a government tanker housed in the same relief camp, which people have also shown to the local administration
 raahat shivi main davaaiyaan nahinpahale khaanaa nahin phir pani main keede-makode, kai log raahat camp tak chhodane lage hai
 In this relief camp, many people were found who have been suffering from many diseases due to insect bites in the flood, but there is nothing in the name of medicines
 in raahat campon main sarkari suvidha nahin hone kii vajah se logon nesarkari raahat shivironko chhodana bhi shuru kar diya he

 Since 1998, no party has won 2 consecutive elections from this region, it will be interesting to see if after the SP-BSP alliance, now BJP can get a second consecutive victory from here after 21 years or No

 # chaiwala kuch maah pehle paris main hue aatanki hamale kaa ghaav abhi bharaa bhi nahin ki ab belgium kii rajdhani brussels ko aatankiyon ne apana nishaanaa bana liya
 This attack was carried out by the dreaded terrorist organization ISIS
 is hamale ke baad puri duniya main ek sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya europea deshon ke hamale se baukhalaakar bagdadi ne is hamale kii sajeesh rachi he
 Dahl woke up for Belgium Belgian on Tuesday morning
 ek ke baad ek bam dhamaakon sebelgiyamki rajdhani bracels dahal uthaa
 With this terror attack, people had bitter memories of terrorist attacks in Paris
 darasal is hamale ke baad paris ke aansu belgium kii ankhon se nikal rahe hai
 The first blast took place at Javanthem Airport in Brussels
 uske baad american airlines ke check-in point ke paas do aatmghaatee hamalaavaron ne khud ko uda liya
 And then there was a strong explosion at Malbiq metro station
 bagdadi kaa badlaairport par yah hamalaa sicurity check point se pehle deporchar haul main hua
 After this there was a stampede among the people
 main building se dhuaan nikalne laga
 The airport was evacuated soon after the blast
 har chehre par khauf kii lakeeren dikh rahi thim
 There was a feeling of pain and fear in every eye
 har taraf afratfari machi hui thi
 The explosion took place there when Saleh Abdeslam, the main suspect in the terrorist attack in Paris, was arrested
 belgium main iesas ke aatanki saalaah abdesalam kii giraftaar ke baad se hi puure desh main hai alert jari kar diya gaya tha
 The Belgian government believes that this action has been taken by the terrorists to take revenge
 jinda hua bagdadi kaa khufbelgium ne apane itihaas main aisa aatanki hamalaa kabhi nahin dekha tha
 This attack on the capital of Belgium, which is considered to be the focal point of the European Union, is showing the terrorist outbreak and existence of Baghdadi
 is hamale ke baad yah bhi saaf ho gaya ki ab europe bagdadi ke nishane par aa chukaa he
 After this attack, the talk of the biggest mastermind of terror, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, has intensified
 perisamen aatanki hamale ke baad jis tarah france, rus or duusare europea deshon ne bagdadi ke thikaanon par hamalaa bolaa tha, usase bagdadi kii aatanki duniya tahas nahas hone lagi thi
 No one knows where he is hiding himself
 lekin belgium hamale ke baad uskaa khauf jinda ho gaya he
 The reason for the attack: Saleh's arrest! Four months after the terrorist attack on Paris, after the terrorist attacks on the Belgian capital of Brussels, there is a question that what could be the reason behind this attack
 kahin paris atake ke sandigdh saleh abdeslam kii giraftaar? to isaki vajah nahin he
 Four months ago, the main suspect in the terrorist attack on the French capital, Paris, was Saleh Abdeslam
 hamale ke baad se hi vah faraar tha
 But on Friday, he was caught in Belgium
 is giraftaar ne bagdadi kii team ko baichaiyn kar diya
 Baghdadi fears that Saleh will unleash all his secrets
 adar aisa hua to unki sari polpattee khul jaaegi
 That is why this terrorist attack is believed to have taken place
 aatankiyon kii rajdhani bana belgiyamkabaron kii maane to pichley saal paris main hue aatanki hamale ke baad tamaam aatanki france se nikalakar belgium pahunch gaye the
 And they had taken shelter there
 jis saleh abdeslam ko paris atake kaa mukhya sandigdh mana jaataa he, uskaa janm bhi belgium main hi hua tha
 It is estimated that the terrorists have carried out these blasts to strengthen their terrorist bases in Belgium
 hamale se bagdadi ne dikhaai takatparis par hamale ke baad se hi bagdadi europe ke deshon, rus or america ke nishane par tha
 There were successive attacks on Baghdadi targets
 syria-libya-iraq main bagdadi ke tel ke kuen or duusare samrik thikaanon ko europea or roosi fouj ne nestnabud kar diya
 During this time it was also reported that Baghdadi may have ended between the attacks
 lekin belgium kii rajdhani par hue aatanki hamale se bagdadi ne yah ishaara kar diya ki uskaa aatanki vajood abhi khatm nahin hua he
 Conspiracy to scare Europe in the same way that European countries have left no stone unturned to break the back of Baghdadi, after which Baghdadi may have conspired to intimidate the whole of Europe on the pretext of Belgium
 jis tarah se bam dhamaake karne vaale baad main arabi main naare laga rahe the, usase yah bhi lagata he ki wo majahab ke naam par unmaad failaana chaahate the
 Baghdadi itself is also playing Holi in the name of Islam in the world
 aatank kaa commander he salehabagdadi iesas kaa sabase bada aatankwaadi he to saleh europe main uskaa aatanki commander
 The main suspect in the attack in Paris was Saleh, who fled after the attack
 paanch din pehle wo belgium main pakadaa gaya to uski rajdhani par aatanki hamale ho gaye
 It was the ill-fated night of 15 November 2015, when hundreds of corpses were laid by the devils of Baghdadi in the beautiful Parisian city
 bataaklaan ke musical haul main aatankiyon ne katleam kiya or sangeet se sarabor maahaul main maut kaa sannata pasar gaya tha
 Saleh Abdeslam is the henchman of Baghdadi who carried out this terrorist attack
 uskaa puraa khandaan aatank ke khel main gale tak duba he
 Two of his brothers were killed in the Paris attack itself
 munhtod jawaab dene kaa vaktabelgium hamale ke chand ghante baad hi iesas ne is hamale kii jimmedaari lene kaa elaan kar diya
 The whole world was aghast, wondering if the arrest of his henchmen had so much terror in him that he decided to kill innocent passengers
 Europe is under the target of ISIS and there is evidence of an attack on Paris before Brussels
 paris main tabaahi kaa puraa taana-bana isi aatanki saleh ne rachaa tha
 Logistic help was given by Abdeslam in the Paris attack
 hamale main istemaal hui foxwagon polo car usee ne rent par lee thi
 He also purchased detonators from a fireworks shop
 ab saleh ko brussels police ne daboch liya he lekin bagdadi kaa badla belgium par baari pad gaya
 Now whatever the world may have to give a befitting reply to ISIS
 aaj netaji ne ek bade rajya ke netaji kii asthi kalash yatra ko hari jhandi dikhaani thi
 a total of 2019 workers were included in the yatra, including all district and divisional level office-bearers
 saare chuttay kaaryakarta netaji ko shrridhanjali dene ke liye machal rahe the
 As soon as Netaji's eyes were fixed on the green flag, he disguised himself like a horse and said, 'this flag smells of communalism
 ham dharmanirpeksh desh ke jimmedaar party ke netaa hai
 The color of this flag should be changed
 phir ham hari jhandi dikhaaenge
 Sorry flag will be displayed
 ' sarkari babu bolaa, 'sar hameshaa jhandi hari hi dikhaai jaati he
 Can not change its color
 ' netaa ji bole, 'is jhandi kaa color kesari karo
 Are you new to this department? You have not received the order of our secretary? In which we have said that whatever we inaugurate, the color of it should be saffron
 pichley hafte aapane akhbaar main dekha nahin? hamane safron toileton kaa udghaatan kiya? usase pehle ham kesari murdaghaaton ko janata ko samarpit kar chuke hai
 Netaji's car and sofa seat covers were also of Kesari color
 inke chamachon ne to sari hadein paar kar di thi
 Netaji's toilet paper roll was also made of the same color
 koi bhi deshbhakti or rashtriyata kaa utkrisht parichay dene main peeche nahin rahanaa chahta tha
 One had even proposed to paint his copper peak in this national color
 netaji kaa pikdaan asthi kalash ke saath-saath chal rahaa tha
 It was difficult to distinguish the two
 netaji sabase aage asthi kalash liye desh ke vikaas kaa netritv kar rahe the
 All the disciples wanted to be grateful to take the urn in their hands
 bich-bich main netaji ko paan thukne ke liye pikdaan pakadaaya jaataa tab chelon main asthi kalash ko lene kii hode much jaati
 Many times in this snatch, i could not know which bone urn is there and which peak? As the Kalash Toli reached the ghat after a long journey, Netaji burst into flames after seeing the white sheets on the stairs
 kisi ne samajhaayaa, sar pairon kii neeche aa jate isliye kesari chadar nahin laae
 The time of immersion of bones was being removed
 netaji ke haath main kalash kii jagah pikdaan tha
 In the disturbance of the voices of the bone urn throwing Netaji two peaks here, Netaji threw the bone urn into the Ganges
 chaaron ore netaji ke jayakaare lag rahe the

 This cheap food is not for the common man
 is tak sirf chuninda logon kii hi pahunch he
 Parliament canteen is being discussed here
 yahaan milane vaala khaanaa bazaar kii tulana main kahin sasta he
 Let's first look at the prices of food available in the canteen of Parliament
 bread and butter- 6 ruchapati- 2 ruchican kari- 50 ruchican katlet plate- 41 ruchican tandoori- 60 rucoffee- 5 rudosa plane- 12 rufish kari- 40 ruhyderaabadi chikan biryani- 65 rumatan kari- 45 ruuble chaaval- 7 rusoup- 14 rusansad kii canteen ke saste khaane kaa lutf saansad or unke mehmaan, purv saansad, sansadeey parisar ke adhikari- anya staff or vaid paas vaale aagatuk hi uthaa sakate hai
 The common man does not have the facility to eat this cheap but he cannot complain
 kyonki daawa kiya jaataa he ki sansad kii canteen ko karadaataaon ke paise se sabsidi nahin di jaati or inhen ‘naa phayda, naa nuksaan’ ke aadhaar par chalaaya jaataa he
 Let us know that in the year 2015 in the canteen of Parliament, the matter of cheap food was very much in the headlines
 aisa is tathy ke saamne aane ke baad hua tha ki sansad kii canteen ko khaane kii laagat par 80 fisadi tak kii sabsidi di jaati he
 At that time, Biju Janata Dal member Vyjayanth Jai Panda wrote a letter to the Lok Sabha speaker on the same issue
 chitthee main unhone kaha tha, ‘jab sarkaar aarthik rup se majboot logon se alpiji sabsidi waapas karne ke liye kah rahi he to aise main saansadon se bhi canteen main sabsidi kii vajah se mil rahi saste khaane kii suvidha waapas le leni chahie
 This move will send a good message to the people and their trust in mps will also increase
 ’saansad kii chitthee milane ke baad loksabhaa ne is par sakaaratmak rukh dikhaaya
 The Lok Sabha Secretariat issued a statement in this regard on 31 December 2015, stating, 'after receiving the report of the committee, the speaker has taken a number of decisions, the most important being that the canteen of Parliament is now based on' No profit, no loss'
 Will work on bayaan main ye bhi kaha gaya- ‘sansad canteen main milane vaali vibhinn khaadya saamagree ke daam badha die gaye he
 Now the actual cost incurred on their cost, they will be sold at the same price
 ’ bayaan main is faisle ko 1 janvari 2016 se lagu hona bataaya gaya
 According to the statement of the Parliament Secretariat, the subsidy was abolished from 1 January 2016 on the food of the canteen of Parliament
 saath hi khaane ke saamaan ke daam badha die gaye
 India Today sought information from the Lok Sabha through RTI to know the effect and effect of this decision
 loksabhaa sachivalay se jo jawaab mila he, usase hairaan karne vaala sanket miltaa he ki sansad kii canteen ke khaane par sabsidi kabhi khatm nahin kii gai
 Let's see from 2013-14 how many subsidies were given to the canteen of Parliament in the last 5 financial years
 2012-13– 12
 52 crores 2013-14- 14
 09 karod ru2014-15- 15
 85 crores Rs
2015-16-15
 97 karod ru2016-17 15
 40 crore rupees It is worth noting that in the year 2015-16, in the year 2015-16, the decision to end the subsidy was 9 months subsidy and 3 months without subsidy
 is vitt varsh main kul 15
 97 crores subsidy given
 agle vitt varsh 2016-17 main jab sansad kii canteen ko sabsidi nahin di jaani thi, tab bhi 15

 On receipt of information, police reached the spot the next morning
 chori ke aarope main tabarez ko nyaayik hiraasat main bheje jane se pehle medical jaanch ke liye sadar aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya

 dhara 302 hatane kaa ye matlab nahin ki wo bari ho gaye hai

 Leader of Opposition in Jharkhand Hemant Soren has targeted the government over the report
 unhone visra report par bhi sawaal uthaaya
 Soren said, "when there is a death due to hunger, this government says that death is due to illness
" jab koi sarkari andekhi kii vajah se khudakushi karata he to sarkaar bayaan jari kar khudakushi kii vajah nijee samasya bataati he
 And now when death occurred due to mob lynching, the government is telling a heart attack behind it

 There are many kinds of incidents happening in a big country, so it is not easy to say anything, but if elections are held today, we will return to power with a big majority

 senaratne ne cabinet sachiv es ebesinghe kaa ek bayaan padhaa, jisamen kaha gaya ki raashtrapati ne apni hatya kii sajeesh rache jane ke bare main ro ke khilaaf kuch nahin kaha he
 He said that as the head of cabinet ministers, the President took note of the news published and circulated on the topics discussed during the cabinet meeting at the President's Secretariat on 16 October 2018

 raashtrapati ne is bare main byoraa nahin diya ki bharat is sajeesh main kaise shaamil tha
 It was reported in the news that Sirisena was against allowing India to develop a terminal near the China-operated Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT)
 sirisena ne isse pehle kaha tha ki dakshini bandargah hambantota china ko pehle hi patte par diya ja chukaa he
 In such a situation, it would not be in Sri Lanka's interest to include India in Colombo port

 The BJP started debuting in the elections by keeping the face in front
 pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi, phir laalkrishna adwani, lekin ab bijepi kii samasya he ki uske paas chehre hi chehre hai

 chehre ko saamne rakhkar chunaav main utarane kii shuruyaat bijepi ne hi kii thi
 First Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then LK Advani, but now the problem of BJP is that it has faces only
 ab tay hua he ki agle saal march main bijepi pradhanmantri pad ke apane ummidavaar kaa naam bataa sakati he
 However, it is being said that the name of the candidate will be decided with the announcement of elections
 chaahe nitin gadakari is pad ke liye aadha darjan naam gina rahe hon, lekin sutron ke mutabik is daud main narendra modi kaa naam hi sabase aage he

 After retiring from the Air Force, Raghbir started his business and established a substantial business in Noida, Delhi, Gurgaon and Ambala in Haryana

 ' kya congress ke andar priyanka gandhi satta kaa nayaa centre banakar ubharengi, yah sawaal abhi uthanaa lajimi he
 Because Priyanka Gandhi's formal entry into politics took place at a time when the Congress has recently formed a government by winning elections in three states and has announced to contest in all the seats apart from SP and BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh
 saal 2004 se raibareli or amethi main prachaar kar rahi priyanka gandhi ke liye uttar pradesh main rasta itnaa bhi aasaan nahin he
 In the 2012 assembly elections, Priyanka Gandhi campaigned in street in Rae Bareli and Amethi
 lekin nattejey congress ke paksh main bilkul nahin ai thi
 The Congress lost from Rae Bareli's 5 assembly seats, Sareni, Bancharava, Harchandpur, Sareni, Unchahar
 jabaki isi chunaav main sapa ne yahaan se chaar siten jiti thim
 Similarly, in Amethi's four assembly seats, the Congress won only 2 seats in Tiloi, Salon, Gauriganj, Amethi, Jagdishpur
 vahiin baat karen saal 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav kii to is chunaav main priyanka gandhi ne raibareli or amethi main jamkar prachaar kiya tha
 Congress won both seats
 haalanki agar in siton ke liye priyanka gandhi prachaar main na bhi utarateen to bhi congress kii hi jeet hoti
 Because Rahul Gandhi from Amethi and Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli were the candidates
 yah baat jarur gaur karne vaali he ki amethi main rahul gandhi ko smriti irani ne thik-thaak takkar di thi or is baar bhi mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi smriti irani ko hi amethi se utaaregi
 In front of Priyanka Gandhi, the Congress is a big challenge to revive in Uttar Pradesh
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main raibareli or amethi main unki maujuudagi kaa asar aasapaas kii siton par ratti bhar nahin padaa tha
 In seats like Lucknow, Sultanpur, Kanpur, Allahabad, Congress candidates lost by a difference of lakhs
 vahiin saal 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav kii baat karen raibareli or amethi kii 10 vidhansabha siton main congress ke khate main sirf 2 hi siten ai thim
 However, Priyanka Gandhi did not come for the election in this election
 us samay congress ke liye ranneeti bana rahe prashanth kishor, priyanka gandhi ko uttar pradesh main cheharaa banane kii bhi salaah bhi di thi
 Rahul Gandhi visited Jaipur for the first time after becoming Congress President
 ise rajasthan chunaav ke liye congress kaa shankhanaad bhi mana gaya
 However, after a warm welcome, Rahul reached Ramlila Maidan to give a speech, forgot the state's issues in the capital Jaipur and was seen only cursing Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 apane 37 minute ke bhaashan main rahul ne sthaneey muddon par baat nahin kii or apane puraane bhaashanon ko nae tareeke se pesh karte najar aae
 During this, he criticized Modi on issues like Rafael, women safety, Dalit violence, minorities, promise of 1
5 million, employment of 2 crore youth, GST, demonetisation etc
 is dauraan unhone kareeb 10 minute rafel par baat kii or anil ambani, udyogpatiyon par nidhaana sadhate rahe
 At the same time, he also whipped Narendra Modi for employment and compared China to India
 saath hi desh main bad rahi hinsa kii ghatnaon par baat kii or madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh ke mudde bhi ginavaate rahe
 During this time he introduced his old speeches in Rajasthan in a new format
 is bhaashan main vijay maalya, neerav modi jaise difolter ke bare main bhi baat kii
 Rahul's question to the PM- How the 45-million-crore debtor Ambani got the Rafale deal, however, during this time, the Congress workers who came to Jaipur from every block, district of Rajasthan, found lack of local issues and some promises for Rajasthan in their captain's speech
 saath hi unhone purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kii sarkaar kaa ek baar bhi zikr nahin kiya or unke dwaara kiye gaye kaamon ko ginavane main naakaam rahe
 Rahul did not even give 5 percent of his speech to Rajasthan
 unhone sirf bijli kii kami, yuvaaon ko rojgaar ko lekar apane bhaashan main rajasthan kaa tadakaa lagane kii koshish kii
 If Rahul Gandhi wanted, the recruitment and disturbances in Rajasthan, the budget cuts of MNREGA, the rising graph of crime, doctor strike, farmer loan waiver, communal tension, reservation, poor law and order and many basic facilities surrounded the Vasundhara government
 Could is dauraan unhone kaha, 'jaise hi congress party 2019 main chunaav jeetegi, ham ye 5 alag-alag str vaale gabbar singh tex ko badalakar ek jiesti denge, ham dijal or petrol ko bhi jiesti main daal denge jisase mahangaai kam hogi
 Difficult for Jaipur, is there any magic that the sachin-rahul duo will be able to do? These things about Rajasthan once they targeted Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kahati hai ki lakhon yuvaaon ko maine rojgaar diya, lekin sachai rajasthan ke yuvaaon ko maaloom he
 The futures had 24 hours of electricity, but only five hours of electricity
 rajasthan main har roj kisaan aatmahatya karata he
 It is noteworthy that Jaipur has traditionally been a stronghold of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
 rahul gandhi kaa ye daura aise samay main ho rahaa he jabaki rajya kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje 40 din kii 'rajasthan gaurav yatra' par hai
 At the same time, Vasundhara is constantly targeting Rahul Gandhi in his public meetings
 visheshkar rahul gandhi ke mandiron main jane ko lekar donon pakshon main haal hi main kaaphi jubaani jang hui he

 Reading the 42-page order of the Election Commission clearly shows that Mulayam Singh Yadav's side did not do their homework properly and did not give full documents to the Commission
 jaankaar ye ye kah rahe the ki agar chunaav ayog ko donon pakshon kii daleelon main dam lagata to vah cycle chunaav nishaan ko philhal zabt kar saktaa tha or apana faisla baad ke liye surakshit kar saktaa tha
 But the Election Commission has clearly stated in its decision that despite repeated demands from the Commission, the Mulayam camp did not give a letter to mlas or mps in support
 yahi nahin, unhone un logon ke naam bhi nahin bataae, jinke shapathpatr akhilesh ne apane samarthan main die the or jin par mulaayam ko shaq tha ki wo farji hai
 (read: Ram Gopal Yadav said - possible alliance with Congress) ayog ne jo faisla sunaaya he, uske para 36 main vistaar se likhaa he ki akhilesh yadav ke kheme ne 228 main se 205 vidhayakon, 68 main se 56 emelsi or 24 main se 15 saansadon ke samarthan kii chitthee di
 Apart from this, the affidavits of 28 National Executive Members out of 46 and 4400 National Representatives out of 5731 were submitted by Akhilesh stating that he is with Akhilesh's camp
 nirvachan ayog ne simbal order ke para 15 kaa zikr karte huye kaha he ki jiske paksh main vidhaayi or santhnik takat he, use hi asli daavedaar mana jaataa he
 These affidavits from Akhilesh strengthened his claim
 lekin iske ulat mulaayam singh yadav kheme kii ore se sirf yahi kaha jaataa rahaa ki party par ab bhi netaji (mulaayam) kii pakad he
 The comments chunaav ayog ne apane order ke para 37, 38 or 39 main saaf likhaa he ki mulaayam singh yadav kii ore se apane samarthan main koi dastauez nahin diye gayi, jabaki ayog ne unhen 9 janvari tak kaa vakt diya tha
 In such a situation, Mulayam's side weakened and Akhilesh's lawyers made it a point during a debate in the Election Commission on 13 January
 ayog ne yah bhi kaha he ki mulaayam singh yadav ne akhilesh yadav kii ore se jamaa kiye gayi shapathpatron kii satyata par to sawaal uthaaye lekin ayog ko apni aapatti ko lekar kabhi santusht nahin kiya
 The Commission has written in para 39 of its order that despite repeated opportunities neither Mulayam Singh Yadav gave any affidavit nor named any MP or MLA whose affidavit he deems to be fake
 ayog ke mutabik mulaayam yahi kehete rahe ki party main koi vighatan nahin hua he or vahi party ke sarvesarva hai
 Obviously, this argument was not enough and the election symbol was given to Akhilesh
 lekin chunaav ayog ne apane faisle main saaf likhaa he ki ayog kii ore se baar-baar maange jane ke baavjood mulaayam kheme ne apane samarthan main vidhayakon yaa saansadon kii chitthee nahin di
 Not only this, he did not even mention the names of those whose affidavits were given by Akhilesh in his support and which Mulayam suspected were fake
 (padhein : ramgopal yadav ne kaha-congress ke saath gathbandhan sambhav) Para 36 of the verdict that the Commission has given reads in detail that the Akhilesh Yadav camp gave a letter of support to 205 mlas out of 228, 56 mlcs out of 68 and 15 out of 24 mps
 iske alaava akhilesh kii ore se 46 main se 28 neshnal akxcutive sadasyon or 5731 main se 4400 rashtriya pratinidhiyon ke halafname saunpe gaye, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki vah akhilesh ke kheme ke saath hai
 The Election Commission, referring to para 15 of the symbol order, has stated that the one who has legislative and organizational strength in its favor is considered the real contender
 akhilesh kii ore se die gaye in shapathpatron se unka daawa majboot hua
 But the Mulayam Singh Yadav camp, on the contrary, kept saying that Netaji (mulayam) still holds the party
 tippaniyan The Election Commission has clearly stated in paras 37, 38 and 39 of its order that no documents were given in support of Mulayam Singh Yadav, while the Commission gave him time till 9 January
 aise main mulaayam kaa paksh kamjor hua or akhilesh ke vakeelon ne 13 janvari ko chunaav ayog main bahes ke dauraan isko mudda banaaya
 The Commission has also said that Mulayam Singh Yadav questioned the veracity of the affidavits submitted by Akhilesh Yadav but never satisfied the Commission about its objection
 ayog ne apane aadesh ke para 39 main likhaa he ki baar-baar avasar diye jane ke baavjood na to mulaayam singh yadav ne koi halafanama diya or na hi kisi saansad yaa vidhayak kaa naam bataaya, jiske shapathpatr ko vah farzi maanate hon
 According to the commission, Mulayam kept saying that there has been no dissolution in the party and he is the surveyor of the party
 jaahir he sirf ye daleel kaaphi nahin thi or chunaav chihn akhilesh ko de diya gaya
 (read: Ram Gopal Yadav said - possible alliance with Congress) ayog ne jo faisla sunaaya he, uske para 36 main vistaar se likhaa he ki akhilesh yadav ke kheme ne 228 main se 205 vidhayakon, 68 main se 56 emelsi or 24 main se 15 saansadon ke samarthan kii chitthee di

 urdu ke kuch aasaan shabd sikhaane kii siries main ham ek baar phir aapke liye paanch shabd or unke matlab lekar hajir hai
 These words are often used in Bollywood songs
 ye kathin nahin hai, hameshaa aapke aas-paas hi hote hai, phir bhi bahut saare log inkaa matlab nahin jaanate

 apni memri main seve kar len, kahin 'shab' sunen yaa padhein to use 'raat' ke rup main samaj len
 Further, the poet imagines that he should use it as 'shab-e-gham' and write 'shab-e-wait'

 The exit poll results may seem slim to the Congress, but Congress leaders believe that exit polls are not credible
 dilli congress ke purv adhyaksh or purv saansad jepi agarwal ne ajtak se khaas baatcheet main kaha ki eczit pole main bhale hi congress ko tisare pardaan par dikhaaya gaya ho, lekin chunaav ke nachije chaunkaane vaale hoge or congress teenon nigamon main jitkar apana meyar banaaegi
 JP Aggarwal says that exit polls are not reliable
 isse pehle bhi media ne eggzet pole main tamilnadu main bhi diemke kii sarkaar bataai thi
 
 
 But everyone saw what happened
 jepi agarwal ne agsit pole par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki ek karod kii aabaadi main kuch hazaar logon kii raay lekar kaise use puri dilli kii raay bataa sakate hai
 JP Aggarwal believes that the Congress is winning in all three mcds
 teenon emsidi main meyar congress ke hi banenge
 Just before the MCD elections in the Congress, JP also described the discord as baseless and said that the Congress party contested well
 jepi ne kaha ki khud unhone kai sabhaayen kii, shila dikshit ne gandhi nagar main sabha kii
 All worked within their respective areas
 ye aapkaa bolnaa galat he ki congress bikhri hui thi
 JP also spoke on Arvinder Singh Lovely and Barkha Shukla Singh joining BJP and said that those who have gone out of the party to BJP, if they are alleging that they are not heard in the party then this is their personal matter is
 agar wo ye bolte ki congress garibon kii nahin sun rahi yaa phirajhuggiyon main rahane waalon parab dhyaan nahin de rahi to main maanata kii aarope sahi he, lekin ve party chhod kar kisi or party main chale gaye phir aarope laga rahe hai, to iskaa congress se koi lenaa dena nahin
 However, JP also termed Lovely and Barkha's move to BJP
 vot kam pade kyonki bijepi-aap se log niraash
 
 
 Despite the low voting, JP Aggarwal told the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party the reason
 jepi ke mutabik voting kam hui, kyonki log bijepi or aap ko vot dene hi nahin nikle
 JP said what the Aam Aadmi Party did in two years
 
 
 jhuthe vaade kiye or to kuch kiya nahin
 
 
 The same situation is with BJP

 bacchee jaise hi kamare ke andar gai, aaropee ne darwaja band kar diya or us par jhapat padaa

 musalamaanon ke matadhikaar par pehle se vivaadon main fansishivasenaane apane mukhpatr 'saamana' main is ore ek or vivaadit lekh likhaa he
 In its new article, mouthpiece editor and party leader Sanjay Raut has spoken about giving voting rights only to those who get family planning done
 sanjay raut ne apane lekh main likhaa he, 'sirf 14 karodamusalamaanon kii khushamadakarne main desh kii raajnneeti hameshaa mashgool rahati he
 If this country is not of Hindus, then the rule of Mughals will not be allowed to come under the guise of secularism in this country
 musalmaan is desh ke dushman nahin, lekin muslim vot bank kii raajnneeti desh ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he
 In the country, only those people who get the right to vote should get family planning
 'yahi nahin, raut ne najma hepatulla or mukhtaar abbaas nakvi par sawaal uthaane waleemm netaa asadauddin ovaisiper bhi kadi tippanee kii he
 Raut has written that Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Najam Heptulla both sing Vande Mataram
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle 12 april ko chape ek anya lekh main rautamusalamaanon se matadhikaarchhinane kii vakaalat or maang kar chuke hai
 However, later on deepening the controversy, he took a U-turn from his article and said that the media misrepresented him
 raut ke lekh par tippanee karte hue aawaisi ne kaha tha ki kya shivasena bijepi saansad mukhtaar abbaas nakvi or najma hepatulla se bhi matadhikaar chhinegi
 What was written earlier? Before this, Raut created a political storm in a 'saamana' article by writing that the Muslim franchise should be abolished to stop the use of Muslims as votebank by political parties
 raut ne sampadakeey lekh main kaha tha, 'muslimon ke saath hue anyaay se ladane ke naam par votbank kii raajnneeti kii ja rahi he
 His educational and health status is being used for politics
 yah raajnneeti pehle congress ne kii, lekin ab har doosraa vyakti khud ko dharmanirpeksh bataata he
 'he had said,' If Muslims are being used only for this kind of politics, then they can never develop
 muslimon kaa prayog jab tak vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye kiya jayega tab tak muslimon kaa koi bhavishya nahin hoga or isliye balasaheb (shivasena ke sansthaapak bal thakare) ne ekbar kaha tha ki muslimon se matadhikaar waapas le lo
 What he said is correct
 'baad main kuch yun liya tha you-turnbad main aalochakon ke nishane par aane ke baad sanjay raut neyu-turnalete hue kaha tha, 'maine yah nahin likhaa ki muslimon se matadhikaar waapas le lenaa chahie
 i just said that if they are not allowed to vote, Muslims will not be used for political opportunism
 ' unhone aage kaha, 'maine nahin kahaaki muslimon ko unke matadhikaar se vanchit kar dena chahie
