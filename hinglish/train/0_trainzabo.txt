 hollywood main abhi tak kaa sabase heart braking algaav actor bread pit or anjalina jolly kaa hi rahaa he
 The news about this couple, who have been living apart for a year, comes every day
 haal kii ek report ke mutabik bread pit ne mana he ki pehali patni jenifer aniston ko anjalina jolly ke liye chhodana unki jindagi kii sabase badi galati sabit hui he
 a website quoted by Brad Pitt says that when he is not in touch with Jennifer right now, he does not even love her
 lekin unhen ab lag rahaa he ki wo apni pehali patni se kitna pyaar karte the
 Angelina Jolly told- After the separation from Brad, illness was reported that Jennifer married herself to actor Justin Theroux in 2015

 reports ke mutabiq bread kii is sweekaarokti ke baad jenifer apane aansuon ko nahin roak pain
 For years, the pain inside her came out and she wept bitterly
 bataa den ki khabaren ai thim ki bread pit 21 saal kii actress ailaa purnell ko date kar rahe hai
 Aila played Angelina's teenage role in the film Mellificent
 12 saal baad bread pit se alag hongi angelina joli, maangi sabhi bacchon kii castady Manipulations are on to form the government in Jammu and Kashmir
 sabase badi party ke taur pidipi ubhari he to duusare number par bijepi rahi
 While PDP had got 21 seats last time and this time it has got 28 seats, bjp's share was 11 last time and 25 seats have come this time
 bijepi ne jahaan pidipi, neshnal conferes or congress ke mukaable sirf 75 ummidavaar hi chunaav main utaare or uske 25 jeet gaye
 The PDP is number one on the basis of seats, but BJP is number one in terms of vote percentage
 23 fisadi vot bijepi ko mila to pidipi ko 22
 7 percent
 pichhali baar ke chunaav main bijepi kaa vot pratishat 12
 If it was 5 percent, then this time it increased to 23 percent
 vahiin, aaj bhale hi kaha ja rahaa ho ki bijepi kaa camel kashmir ke chunaav main nahin khil paaya ho, lekin sahi myne main kashmir main pehali baar barf ke pani main bhi camel to khil hi gaya he, yani wo haar karke bhi jeet gai he
 Maybe, many people will not believe my point, but for the first time BJP was discussed everywhere in the valley
 pehali dfa kai jagah bijepi ke poster or jhande dikhe
 BJP candidates were openly campaigning for the first time
 31 saal main pehali baar koi pradhanmantri bijepi kii chunavi raily khule maidan main karata najar aada
 For the first time, BJP got close to 2
5 percent votes in Kashmir Valley
 pehali baar uske 33 ummidavaar ghati main chunavi maidan main the
 In the last election, the BJP had received only 14,000 votes in the entire Kashmir, whereas this time it has increased to 48 thousand
 yahaan par bijepi ke 39 kendriya netaaon ne sabha kii
 Moreover, the BJP, which had forfeited its bail till every time in the elections, was second in many seats and third in many places
 ye sab baaten isaliye or ahm ho jaati hai kyonki is chunaav se pehle kabhi bhi kisi chunaav main kashmir main bijepi ke jhande nahin dikhte the or na hi use yahaan ummidavaar milte the
 The talk of election campaign and rally was far away
 haalat yah the ki koi bijepi ke bare main baat karnaa tak pasand nahin karata tha
 One such 'untouchable' party that everyone in Kashmiri used to avoid
 par ab halaat badal se gaye hai
 That is why Sajjad Lone, sometimes called separatist leader, calls Prime Minister Modi as elder brother
 kashmir main bijepi kaa cheharaa samajhe jane vaali hina bhatta kahati hai ki kashmir main to bijepi kaa camel to khil chukaa he or kripaya ise chunavi jeet yaa haar se na anke
 Moreover, the leaders of the National Conference and PDP, both the main parties of the Valley, hope that if the situation in Kashmir improves, it will be possible only because of Modi and BJP
 jammu-kashmir bijepi ke netaa ramesh arora kehete hai ki jammu kashmir ko lekar hamaari party kii ranneeti puri tarah se kaamyaab rahi he
 This is the first time that there have been no allegations of rigging in the assembly elections
 vaise bijepi kii soch thi ki agar wo khud sarkaar na bana paae to koi bhi sarkaar bane uski bhoomika ko kisi bhi haal main nazarandaaj nahin kiya janaa chahie
 How special Kashmir is on the agenda of the BJP and Modi itself can be gauged from the fact that hardly a month has passed since Modi became Prime Minister
 is baar agar jammu-kashmir main pichley baar kii tulana main paanch fisadi matdaan kaa pratishat badha he to iskaa bhi credit bijepi ko hi jaataa he
 The BJP leaders themselves believe that separatists did not appeal for the election boycott because of Modi's fear
 modi ke virodh kii vajah se kashmir ke log gharon se baahar nikle ki kisi bhi haalat main jammu-kashmir kaa mukhyamantri bijepi kaa na bane
 bjp's image has also been anti-muslim in Kashmir and during the cancer elections, the statements of BJP and its associated leaders about conversion to many parts of the country were fulfilled
 main kashmir ko pandrah saalon se lagaataar dekhtaa rahaa hum
 But the kind of change heard in these elections is indicating a new political situation
 kam taiyaari or bina kisi thos jameen ke baad bhi bijepi ne jis tarah se kashmir main upasthiti darj karai he usase lagata he ki aane vaale saalo main keval jammu tak simit na rahakar dal jhil me bhi camel khilaa sakati he
 Taking a dig at the controversy over his presence at the opening ceremony of the second phase of the bandra-worli Sealink in Mumbai, Amitabh Bachchan lashed out at his opponents, saying that the controversy over the issue was deliberate
 megaster ne kaha ki is kaarykram ke bare main akhabaaron main aadha prishth kaa vigyaapan diya gaya tha
 He said this indirectly in response to Chief Minister Ashok Chavan's statement in which Chavan said that if he had known about Bachchan being there, he would not have attended it
 bachchan ne kaha, ‘mujhe aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 i received a formal invitation from the Minister of Public Works Department on his letter head
 ’ yah vibhaag pradesh main gathbandhan kii sahyogi party rakanpa ke paas he
 Regarding the displeasure of Mumbai Congressmen over Bachchan's presence at the inauguration of the second phase of Bandra Worli Sealink on Wednesday, he said, 'I was there
 behad acha kaarykram tha
 What happened next is their problem, not mine
 ’ceilink kaa udghaatan karne vaale chavaan ne kaha ‘vah (bachchan) duusare rajya ke brands ambesder hai
 We would like our state to grow
 agar mujhe unki vahaan maujuudagi kaa pataa hota to shaayad main usamen shirkat nahin karata
 Bachchan said that he left politics 25 years ago and is not associated with any political party
 amitabh ne apane blog main likhaa he, ‘meri bhagidaari par nayaa vivaad paidaa kiya ja rahaa he
 The media has been following me since the ceremony on Sea Link
 ’ haalanki, saarvajanik upkram mantri or emesardisi ke chairman jaidatt kshirsagar ne amitabh bachchan ko bulaane ke faisle ko sahi tehraate hue kaha ki vah ek mahanayake hai
 BJP spokesperson in Delhi, Rajiv Pratap Rudy said, "the bandra-worli Sea Link is not a Congress but a national asset
" har bhartiya ko vahaan hone kaa adhikaar he
 Undoubtedly Amitabh Bachchan is the pride of the country and is a distinguished Mumbaikar who deserves to be the chief guest there
 ’congress mahasachiv janardan dvivedi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ‘jo kuch hua usase party waakif he
 The Chief Minister has already given clarification
 party kaaryakarta naakhush isaliye hai ki bachchan ne khud ko modi se joda he
 Bachchan said that those who are angry about relations with Gujarat do not have the courage to stop 'any Ratan Tata or any Ambani' from investing in the state and running a successful venture
 unhone kaha ‘kya aapke paas unhen yah kehane kaa saahas he ki rajya se sambandh na rakhen apana puraa nivesh or maanavshram vahaan se waapas le len main sochataa hum ki nahin
 You can bring politics in any case, but what will happen to the person who is non-political
 yah vaaki sharmnaak he

 / p> Pakistan, which has repeatedly violated ceasefire along the border, has now accused India of spying on India, claiming that its army has dropped an Indian drone in a Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok)
 vahiin, duusari ore bharat ne padosi desh kaa yah daawa sire se khaarij kar diya he
 Pakistani intelligence agency ISI issued a statement saying- 'indian drone Cosena entered into Bhokeber of pok dropped
 yah drone vayusima kaa ulanghan karte hue paak aayaa tha
 According to the report of Pakistani newspaper Dawn, in this case the Pakistani Army claims that the Indian Army is trying to get their intelligence through drones
 drone main lagespai camaron ke jariepioke kii tasviren hasil karne kaa prayaas kiya ja rahaa tha
 Woman's death in Pak Rangers firing This accusation of Pakistan has come at a time when a woman died on the Jammu and Kashmir international border in the firing done by Pakistan Rangers just a day before, while three people including an army soldier Were injured bhartiya sena or bhartiya vaayu sena ne haalanki yah daawa sire se khaarij kar diya ki unka koi drone maar giraaya gaya he yaa durghatnagrast hua he
 a spokesman for the Indian Army said, 'there are some reports of a drone accident in Pak Occupied Kashmir
 bhartiya sena kaa koi bhi drone yaa yuavi durghatnagrast hua he
 a spokesman for the Indian Air Force also denied that any of their drones had been shot down
 kya aap universal basic inakam ke bare main jaanate hai? kya sarkaar sabhi logon ko basic inakam de sakati he? basic inakam kya he? kya ye berojgaare bhatta he? kya ye vriddhavastha pension he? kya koi sarkaar karodon logon ko basic inakam de sakati he? It is being talked about all over the world
 abhi kahin diya nahin ja rahaa he
 If we look at all the schemes, then the government gives help to a section of the citizens
 lekin universal basic inakam kuch alag jaan padataa he
 After reading a few articles, it means that this means that the government should give basic income from everyone to people below the poverty line to people like you
 maheene ke hisaab se ek tay raashi
 a referendum was held in June this year that the Constitution should be changed to give basic income to everyone unconditionally
 vahaan khub bahes hui, abhiyaan chalaa
 The government and Parliament protested that this would not make people work and one day they would not get workable people
 sweetrezaraland europe hi nahin duniya kaa behatar jivan str vaala desh he
 In such a country, 80 percent of the population has work, there was a debate about universal basic income that the government should give $ 2,524 to every citizen every month
 janamatsangrah main yah prastaav haar gaya
 The proposal was rejected by 77 percent of the vote
 europe ke kai deshon main is vichaar par bahes ho chuki he
 There are many political parties who are now giving it a place in their manifestos
 canada, finland or netherland bhi is par janamat sangrah karaane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 Right now in the atmosphere you will hear that the government should get rid of the notion of a public welfare state
 sarkaar kaa kaam he bijness yaa rojgaar kaa vaataavaran paidaa karnaa
 The subsidy share should be at least in the government's account, but if governments ever arrive at the policy that all eligible unqualified citizens will be given any amount like basic salary, then what will happen to the subsidy reduction arguments
 wo dhara itani majboot ho chuki he ki ab jab koi universal basic inakam kii baat karegaa to yahi lagegaa ki koi kyaali pilav pakaa rahaa he
 Someone will be an old-time communist, or a socialist
 poonjeevaad par chal chuki duniya main yah khyaal kaisaa ajeeb he
 But this idea only thrives in rich countries where the Communist Party has no basis
 america ke silicon vaili kii ek company he vaai combinetor
 It is a funding company
 isane california main basic inakam ko lekar payalat project shuru karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The company says that it wants to study how the basic income will be paid, how its data will be collected
 company ke president kaa kahana he ki jis tarah se technology ke kaaran naukariyaan ja rahi hai, ek din basic inakam lagu karnaa hi pad jayega
 There is a criticism that by this, the government will start giving money to the middle class except the poor
 nattejey main ho saktaa he ki garibi hi bad jaae
 Khair y Combinator will select 100 families from California
 chaahe wo naukari main ho yaa na ho
 Will give them 1000 to 2000 dollars every month
 dekhne ke liye ki unka jivan kaise badalata he
 You must also be thinking like me that if the government starts giving basic income to everyone, then no work will be done
 log aalsee ho jaaenge
 a few days ago Swaminathan Akleshwar Iyer has also written on this in Economic Times
 bijepi ke saansad varun gandhi ne is masale par likhaa he
 Sudipto Mandal, Emeritus Professor of National Institutes of Public Finance and Policy, has also written on The Wire News portal whether the time has come for the idea of universal Basic Income
 america kii ek rudhiwaadi think tanks sanstha he Cato Institute, vahaan ke vidwaan Michael Tanner and Matt Zwolinski kii daleel he ki america kaa jo maujuuda saamaajik suraksha system he wo bhayaavah he
 Its centers and states spend 1 billion dollars on this every year, despite this, 16 percent of America's population lives below the poverty line
 isliye maujuuda sabhi yojanaon ko band kar har america naagarik ko saal main 10,000 dollar milanaa chahie
 Provided he is 21 years of age
 kai logon ko lagata he ki is skim main jhanjhat kam he kyonki aap paatrata kii sharten nahin lagaate ki ise milegaa yaa ise nahin milegaa
 We often do not think about the condition of those who are not getting work
 bharat main manaregaa jaisi yojana he jo kam se kam 100 se 150 dinon ke liye rojgaar dene kii baat karti he
 In reality people may not get employment completely, but is this scheme not a short form of a scheme like Universal Basic Income
 duniya kii har sarkaar sabko kaam dene kii chunauti se jujh rahi he
 Recently we discussed in prime time that in 2015 only 1 lakh 35 thousand jobs were created in India
 2013 se 2015 ke bich baari giravat ai he
 Every day 550 jobs are being lost
 is saal ejineering campus main naukariyon main 20 pratishat kii giravat aa sakati he
 One third of the working population is useless
 68 fisadi kaamgaar pariwaron kii masik kamai 10,000 se adhik nahin he
 All these figures were printed in the reports of different newspapers
 vishwa bank ne bhi ek report jari kii he ki bharat main aane vaale dashakon main 69 fisadi naukariyaan robot ke kaaran khatm ho jaaengi
 Economists like Pranab Bardhan and Vijay Joshi have also advocated it
 inkaa maananaa he ki bharat main is yojana ko aazamaaya janaa chahie
 What will be its model, where will the money come from for this, these are all questions, but the current structure has entered our mind so much that the idea seems either useless or incomprehensible
 technology kii duniya tezi se badal rahi he
 You must have read in the colorful pages of newspapers that the technology of driving a car and a bus without a driver is being developed
 yah trial apane antim charan main he
 On the one hand, Ola and Uber have produced millions of new drivers in India, on the other hand how much we believe on these trials that they will soon eliminate the community of millions of drivers
 vaise ham bina gear or klach vaali automatic car chalaane bhi lage hai
 Another technical experiment is that of artificial intelligence
 isse mashin aadmi ko shatranj ke khel main haraa detii he
 Two exchange operators in Wall Street, USA, have announced that they are going to launch an artificial intelligence tool
 jiskaa kaam hoga bazaar ke utaar chadhaav par nazar rakhana
 So, along with the driver, will the masters of the stock market also vanish
 artificial intelligence share bazaar kii baarik dhokhadhadiyon ko aasaani se pakad letaa he jise pakadaney main vahaan ke ustad se bhi chook ho jaati he
 When it comes to Wall Street, think how long it will take to come to India from there
 technology kii raftaar tej ho gai he or log bhi
 If the SP government promised a smartphone in UP, millions of people went to the website and registered it
 aae din centre se lekar tamaam sarkarein ap jari kar rahi hai
 Many people are still outside the world of this technology, but many people, including ordinary people, are also coming under its purview
 tippaniyan If you will be driving by Ola or Uber car, then that old driver of your city does not know the routes now
 smartphone par google map jaise jaise rasta bataata he vaise vaise wo chalata he
 Like he is driving a car in Delhi but not in Delhi but in Japan
 aaj hi maine anubhav kiya ki dryver ne ab raaston ko yaad karne kii maansik prakriya ko chhod diya he
 In a way, depending on the machine, man is also becoming a machine
 agar google map na ho or smartphone na ho to mumkin he ki bahut se log shaam ko apane ghar hi na pahunch paaen
 While wandering in the crowd of Dhanteras, reach Sonipat from Delhi and find your home address there
 baharhaal universal basic skim par baat karenge
 Jobs will not be a challenge, it has been an all-time challenge, but the idea of giving universal basic income is not less than a challenge in itself
 duniya bhar main is par baat hone lagi he
 Not being given anywhere right now
 tamaam yojanaon ko dekhenge to sarkaar nagarikon ke ek tabake ko madad raashi detii he
 But universal basic income looks different
 chand lekh pard kar laga ki iskaa matlab yahi he ki sarkaar sabhi ko yani garibi rekha se neeche ke logon se lekar ham aap jaise logon ko basic inakam de
 a fixed amount by month
 isi saal june main is baat ko lekar janamat sangrah hua ki bina shart sabhi ko basic inakam dene ke liye samvidhan main badlaav karnaa chahie
 There was a lot of debate, campaigning took place
 sarkaar or sansad ne virodh kiya ki isse to log kaam nahin karenge or ek din kaam laayak log nahin milenge
 Switzerland is not only a country with a better standard of living in Europe
 80 fisadi aabaadi ke paas kaam he, aise desh main universal basic inakam ko lekar bahes hui ki sabhi naagarik ko har maheene sarkaar 2,524 dollar de
 This motion was defeated in the referendum
 77 fisadi vot se yah prastaav riject ho gaya
 The idea has been debated in many countries of Europe
 kai raajnneetik dal hai jo ab ise apane ghoshnapatron main jagah dene lage hai
 Canada, Finland and the Netherlands are also considering holding a referendum on it
 abhi apane aap se maahaul main aap yahi sunate honge ki sarkaar ko lok kalyankari rajya kii dharna se mukti paa leni chahie
 The government's job is to create an environment of business or employment
 sarkaar ke khate main sabsidi kaa hissaa kam se kam hona chahie lekin agar sarkarein kabhi is niti par pahunchati hai ki sabhi yogya ayogy nagarikon ko basic selary jaisi koi raashi di jaaegi to phir sabsidi kam karne vaale tarkon kaa kya hoga
 That stream has become so strong that now when someone talks about universal basic income, then it will feel that someone is cooking an empty casserole
 koi puraane jamaane kaa communist hoga, yaa phir socialist
 How strange is this idea in the world that has gone on capitalism
 magar yah khyaal panpa hi he amir deshon main jahaan communist party kaa koi aadhaar tak nahin he
 y Combinator is a company in Silicon Valley, USA
 ye funding company he
 It has announced to start a pilot project on basic income in California
 company kaa kahana he ki wo is baat kaa adhyayan karnaa chaahati he ki basic inakam kaa bhugtan kaise hoga, iskaa data kaise jamaa hoga
 The president of the company says that due to the way technology is leaving jobs, one day basic income will have to be implemented
 ek aalochana he ki isse to sarkaar garibon ko chhod middle class ko paisa dene lagegi
 As a result, poverty may only increase
 kair vaai combinetor california ke sau pariwaron kaa chayan karegi
 Whether it is in a job or not
 unhen har maheene 1000 se 2000 dollar degi
 To see how their life changes
 aap bhi meri tarah soch rahe honge ki agar sarkaar sabhi ko basic inakam dene lage to koi kaam hi nahin karegaa
 People will become lazy
 iconomic times main kuch din pehle swaminathan akleshwar ayyar ne bhi is par likhaa he
 BJP MP Varun Gandhi has written on this issue
 National Institue Of Public Finance and Policy ke emiratus professor sudipto mandal ne bhi di vir news portal par likhaa he ki kya universal basic inakam ke vichaar kaa samay aa gaya he
 The Cato Institute, an orthodox think tank organization in the United States, argues that the current social security system of America is horrifying, by scholars Michael Tanner and Matt Zwolinski
 vahaan ke centre or rajya har saal 1 arab dollar is par kharch karte hai iske baavjood america kii 16 fisadi aabaadi garibi rekha se neeche rahati he
 Therefore, every American citizen should get $ 10,000 a year by closing all existing plans
 basharte uski umr 21 saal kii ho
 Many people feel that the problem in this scheme is less because you do not put the eligibility conditions whether it will be received or not
 ham aksar ye nahin sochate ki jinhen kaam nahin mil rahaa he unki haalat kya hoti he
 There is a scheme like MNREGA in India which talks about giving employment for at least 100 to 150 days
 hakeekat main bhale puri tarah se logon ko rojgaar na miltaa ho lekin kya ye skim universal basic inakam jaisi yojana kaa chota rup nahin he
 Every government in the world is facing the challenge of giving work to all
 haal hi main hamane prime time main is par charchaa kii thi ki bharat main 2015 main sirf 1 lakh 35 hazaar naukariyon kaa hi srijan hua
 There has been a steep decline between 2013 and 2015
 har din 550 naukariyaan khatm hoti ja rahi hai
 This year, there may be a 20 percent drop in jobs on engineering campuses
 kaam kar sakane vaali aabaadi kaa ek tihaai bekaar he
 68 percent of working families do not have a monthly earning of more than 10,000
 ye saare aankade alag alag akhbaaron kii report main chape the
 The World Bank has also released a report that in the coming decades, 69 percent of jobs in India will be lost due to robots
 pranab bardhan or vijay joshi jaise arthshaastriyon ne bhi isaki vakaalat kii he
 They believe that this scheme should be tried in India
 iske model kya honge, iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega, ye sab sawaal to hai lekin hamaare dimaag main maujuuda dhaancha is kadar ghus gaya he ki yah vichaar yaa to bekaar lagata he yaa phir samaj se baahar
 The world of technology is changing rapidly
 aap aae din akhabaaron ke rangeen pannon main padhate honge ki bina dryver ke car or bas chalaane kii technology viksit kii ja rahi he
 This trial is in its final stages
 ek taraf bharat main hi ola or ubar ne lakhon nae dryver paidaa kar diye, duusari taraf ham in trial par kitna yakeen karen ki ye jaldi hi lakhon driver kii birdari ko hi khatm kar denge
 By the way, we have also started running automatic cars with no gear and clutch
 ek or takniki prayog he artificial intelligence kaa
 This makes the machine beat the man in a game of chess
 america ke wal street main do exange oparator ne elaan kiya he ki ve artificial intelligence tul launch karne ja rahe hai
 Whose job will be to keep an eye on market fluctuations
 to kya dryver ke saath-saath share bazaar ke ustad bhi gaayab ho jaaenge
 Artificial intelligence easily captures the fine frauds of the stock market, which is also missed by the master there
 jab ye wal street main aa jayega to sochiye vahaan se bharat aate kitni der lagegi
 The speed of technology has increased and people too
 upi main sapa sarkaar ne smartphone kaa vaada kiya to lakhon logon ne website par jaakar registration kara diya
 In the coming days, all the governments from the center are releasing apps
 bahut se log is technology kii duniya se ab bhi baahar hai lekin bahut se log jisamen aam log bhi shaamil hai iske daayre main aate bhi ja rahe hai
 The comments agar aap ola yaa ubar car se chalate honge to aapke hi shahar kaa wo purana dryver ab raaston ko nahin jaanata he
 The way Google Map on a smartphone shows the way it moves
 jaise wo dilli kaa hokar dilli main nahin balki japan main car chalaa rahaa ho
 Today i realized that the driver has now given up the mental process of remembering the routes
 ek tarah se mashin par nirbhar hote hote aadmi bhi mashin ho rahaa he
 If there is no Google map and no smartphone, it is possible that many people are unable to reach their homes in the evening
 dhanteras kii bheed main ghoomte ghamate dilli se sonipat pahunch jaaen or vahaan apane ghar kaa pataa dhund rahe hon
 However, we will talk on Universal Basic Scheme
 naukariyaan nahin hongi ye chunauti to har daur kii rahi he lekin universal basic inakam dene kaa idia hi apane aap main kisi chunauti se kam nahin
 a referendum was held in June this year that the Constitution should be changed to give basic income to everyone unconditionally
 vahaan khub bahes hui, abhiyaan chalaa
 The government and Parliament protested that this would not make people work and one day they would not get workable people
 sweetrezaraland europe hi nahin duniya kaa behatar jivan str vaala desh he
 In such a country, 80 percent of the population has work, there was a debate about universal basic income that the government should give $ 2,524 to every citizen every month
 janamatsangrah main yah prastaav haar gaya
 The proposal was rejected by 77 percent of the vote
 europe ke kai deshon main is vichaar par bahes ho chuki he
 There are many political parties who are now giving it a place in their manifestos
 canada, finland or netherland bhi is par janamat sangrah karaane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 Right now in the atmosphere you will hear that the government should get rid of the notion of a public welfare state
 sarkaar kaa kaam he bijness yaa rojgaar kaa vaataavaran paidaa karnaa
 The subsidy share should be at least in the government's account, but if governments ever arrive at the policy that all eligible unqualified citizens will be given any amount like basic salary, then what will happen to the subsidy reduction arguments
 wo dhara itani majboot ho chuki he ki ab jab koi universal basic inakam kii baat karegaa to yahi lagegaa ki koi kyaali pilav pakaa rahaa he
 Someone will be an old-time communist, or a socialist
 poonjeevaad par chal chuki duniya main yah khyaal kaisaa ajeeb he
 But this idea only thrives in rich countries where the Communist Party has no basis
 america ke silicon vaili kii ek company he vaai combinetor
 It is a funding company
 isane california main basic inakam ko lekar payalat project shuru karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The company says that it wants to study how the basic income will be paid, how its data will be collected
 company ke president kaa kahana he ki jis tarah se technology ke kaaran naukariyaan ja rahi hai, ek din basic inakam lagu karnaa hi pad jayega
 There is a criticism that by this, the government will start giving money to the middle class except the poor
 nattejey main ho saktaa he ki garibi hi bad jaae
 Khair y Combinator will select 100 families from California
 chaahe wo naukari main ho yaa na ho
 Will give them 1000 to 2000 dollars every month
 dekhne ke liye ki unka jivan kaise badalata he
 You must also be thinking like me that if the government starts giving basic income to everyone, then no work will be done
 log aalsee ho jaaenge
 a few days ago Swaminathan Akleshwar Iyer has also written on this in Economic Times
 bijepi ke saansad varun gandhi ne is masale par likhaa he
 Sudipto Mandal, Emeritus Professor of National Institutes of Public Finance and Policy, has also written on The Wire News portal whether the time has come for the idea of universal Basic Income
 america kii ek rudhiwaadi think tanks sanstha he Cato Institute, vahaan ke vidwaan Michael Tanner and Matt Zwolinski kii daleel he ki america kaa jo maujuuda saamaajik suraksha system he wo bhayaavah he
 Its centers and states spend 1 billion dollars on this every year, despite this, 16 percent of America's population lives below the poverty line
 isliye maujuuda sabhi yojanaon ko band kar har america naagarik ko saal main 10,000 dollar milanaa chahie
 Provided he is 21 years of age
 kai logon ko lagata he ki is skim main jhanjhat kam he kyonki aap paatrata kii sharten nahin lagaate ki ise milegaa yaa ise nahin milegaa
 We often do not think about the condition of those who are not getting work
 bharat main manaregaa jaisi yojana he jo kam se kam 100 se 150 dinon ke liye rojgaar dene kii baat karti he
 In reality people may not get employment completely, but is this scheme not a short form of a scheme like Universal Basic Income
 duniya kii har sarkaar sabko kaam dene kii chunauti se jujh rahi he
 Recently we discussed in prime time that in 2015 only 1 lakh 35 thousand jobs were created in India
 2013 se 2015 ke bich baari giravat ai he
 Every day 550 jobs are being lost
 is saal ejineering campus main naukariyon main 20 pratishat kii giravat aa sakati he
 One third of the working population is useless
 68 fisadi kaamgaar pariwaron kii masik kamai 10,000 se adhik nahin he
 All these figures were printed in the reports of different newspapers
 vishwa bank ne bhi ek report jari kii he ki bharat main aane vaale dashakon main 69 fisadi naukariyaan robot ke kaaran khatm ho jaaengi
 Economists like Pranab Bardhan and Vijay Joshi have also advocated it
 inkaa maananaa he ki bharat main is yojana ko aazamaaya janaa chahie
 What will be its model, where will the money come from for this, these are all questions, but the current structure has entered our mind so much that the idea seems either useless or incomprehensible
 technology kii duniya tezi se badal rahi he
 You must have read in the colorful pages of newspapers that the technology of driving a car and a bus without a driver is being developed

 Team India, led by captain Virat Kohli, was hoping to reach the final with a resounding win against New Zealand, but chasing a target of 240 runs, the top order of the Indian team collapsed badly and 3 big balls in just 19 balls
 The batsman was dismissed which also included Virat Kohli himself
 kohli ke cricket kariyar ke is sabase bade mukaable main unase badi or shandaar pari kii aas thi, lekin ain maukey par unka balla hi dagaa de gaya or mahaj 6 gend khelkar mahaj 1 ran par out ho gaye
 Later, despite half-century innings of Ravindra Jadeja (77) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (50), Team India lost by 18 runs

 Not only did he get the team out of the crisis but also led him to victory, but his bat flopped in this semi-final match
 captain viraat kohli ne 236 vanade maichon kii 228 pariyon main vah mahaj paanchavin baar 1 ran banaakar pavilion laute hai
 During this time, he could not open the account 12 times in his ODI career
 apni 228 pariyon main vah 49 baar dahaai kaa aankada paar nahin kar sake or out ho gaye
 While 3 times he returned unbeaten pavilion at a score of less than 10

 If any party in the whole country can support the minorities, it is the Congress
 apane isi nae andaaj ko dikhaane ke liye congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne pradesh main jab 31 jiladhyakshon kii ghoshnaa kii to unamem se sabase adhik 13 jiladhyaksh muslim samaaj se chune gaye
 a large number of backward Muslims also exist in this
 suchi main sirf chaar dalit naam shaamil hai
 This shows that Rahul's Dalit-centric political ideology is forced to take an inevitable turn, colliding with the ground reality
 darasal, rahul ke ranneetikaar samaj rahe hai ki dalit prem apni jagah bahut acha ho saktaa he, lekin uttar pradesh main party ke paas aisa koi kandhaa nahin he jo is voter ko mayawati ke hathi se neeche utaar sake
 On the other hand, Muslim is such a voter, who had given 21 seats to Congress by defeating SP in Lok Sabha elections-2009
 vidhansabha chunaav-2012 main yahi voter sapa ke paas gaya or congress ke 28 emele hi jeet paae
 But now that the SP government has been up for over a year and the Center's fight is UPA vs NDA, then the Congress has every reason to think that Muslim voters can fall in its favor
 sapa ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary is soch par chot karte hai, ‘‘jiladhyakshon ke maamle main congress hamaari nakal kar rahi he
 But the Muslim society knows that Netaji (mulayam Singh Yadav) has been standing with him since 1990
 congress ko kuch milane vaala nahin he
 "by the way, the Congress knows that if something is to be found, it is to meet it here
" party ke pradesh adhyaksh nirmal khatri kehete hai, ‘‘yah sapa kii nakal nahin he, congress kii puraani niti he
 The new one is that this time more leadership is being given to backward class Muslims
 ’’ party sirf sanghathan main musalamaanon ko tarjeeh de rahi ho, aisa nahin he
 Along with this, the engagement of connecting with the common Muslim is also going on
 haal hi main centre main alpsankhyak maamalon ke mantri ke
 When Rahman Khan reached Lucknow, he met Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav at his house
 iske baad sanyukt samvaadadaata sammelan main unhone kaha, ‘‘alpsankhyak kalyaan ke liye centre sarkaar rajya sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam karnaa chaahati he
 On this, the Chief Minister added that during the tenure of the previous State Government, the work of Minority Welfare Schemes has lagged behind
 or yaheen sapa ke kaddavar muslim netaa ajam khan ne nishane par tir lagaaya, ‘‘muslim aarakshan sachhar cameti kii siforeeshon kii buniyadi ruh he
 "pushing the ball into the Congress's court, Azam Khan said," If the UPA government comes up with a proposal for Muslim reservation in Parliament, the SP will fully support it
 isse pataa chal jayega ki koun aarakshan ke paksh main he or koun khilaaf
 "when the SP tried to win over the Muslim issue, Rahman Khan went a step further and said," Unfortunately, Muslims have always understood a religious group and not a social group
 ’’ bijepi kaa naam liye bina unhone kaha ki kuch log muslim aarakshan kii maang ko dharmik rang dena chaahate hai
 These dialogues competing with each other are the hallmark of the electoral entrenchment of Congress and SP
 congress kii taiyaari kaa kshitij is baar vyapak he
 Prior to this development, Rehman Khan taught more than 200 Muslim leaders at the Congress office in Lucknow about minority welfare schemes of the Center
 congress chatapata rahi he ki alpsankhyakon ke liye paisa to centre de rahaa he, lekin shrey sapa lut rahi he
 Immediately after the lesson was over, he reached Darul Uloom Nadwa and met Allana Muslim Personal Law Board President Maulana Rabe Hasani Nadvi
 iske baad eshbagh idgah ke imam moulana khalid rashid farangi mahali or shiya dharmaguru moulana kalbe javwaad se milane kaa silsilaa chalaa
 Rahman not only informed these Muslim leaders about the central schemes but also took "feedback" from them
 varsh 2006 main centre main alpsankhyak maamalon kaa alag mantralay banane ke baad yah pehla mauka tha, jab iskaa koi mantri pradesh ke congress kaaryakartaaon ko yojanaon kii jaankaree dene pradesh mukhyalay pahunchaa
 Is the Congress really leaving the Dalit agenda behind in the process of copying SP? Khatri, MP from a communally sensitive seat like Faizabad, argues, "dalit leaders are constantly being pushed forward, as they are already short of decisive positions, it will take some time to increase the numbers
" ’’ darasal, congress uljhan main he

 Knowledgeable in Muslim affairs and former chairman of the Persian department at Lucknow University, Prof

 After the killing of CO in Kunda and then the death of Khalid Mujahid in police custody, there is resentment against the SP government of the Muslims

 In view of the large population of weavers in Ambedkaranagar district and the Muslim affiliation with the religious place Kichhaucha (dargah) Sharif, the Congress has appointed Syed Merajuddin Kichhavi as the district president
 inke bhaanje kichocha sharif ke sajjadanasheen hai
 The special thing is that most of the focus of Congress is on connecting backward Muslims with the party

 Nafe Ansari has been made the city president in Bulandshahr, while Ayub Jung, who comes from the Muslim Gurjar fraternity in Shamli, has been given the command of the district president and Tariq Qureshi in Muzaffarnagar as city president

 After all, when the Lok Sabha elections came, why did the Congress remember the Muslims? Where was Rahul when communal riots started after the formation of SP government in UP? In order to get the votes of Muslims in the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul needs to find answers to these questions floating among this community

 aspataal jaise sansthaanon ke liye kendriya sarkaar ke kanoon kii tarj par dilli sarkaar kade praavdhaan vaala kanoon laayaa jayega
 However, after canceling the license of Max Hospital, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said on several occasions that his government is not against private hospitals and does not want to hamper their functioning

 mulk kii aazaadee ke 71 saal guzar chuke hai
 During these 71 years, the Muslims of the country have seen many ups and downs and faced many challenges
 iske baavjood musalamaanon ke andar ek behatar jindagi kii ummid kii lau hameshaa jalati rahi or unki ankhon main iskaa khwab sajata rahaa he
 Where and under what condition is the Muslim of the country today after so long after independence
 is mudde par aajtak
 in interacted with all the Muslim intellectuals of the country
 desh kii tahjeeb par atarrligarh muslim uniwarsity itihaas vibhaag ke professor mohammad sajaad kehete hai ki musalmaan desh kii aazaadee se lekar saanskrithik or saamaajik prayek rup main bhagidaar rahaa he
 The reason behind this is their trust in secularism and mixed culture
 samvidhan bhi usee tahjeeb ke tahat bana, jisamen sabhi samaaj ko barabari di gai
 In the last few years, the influence of right-wing forces has increased the dangers on this heritage of the country
 in 71 saalon main musalamaanon ke aarthik halaat sudharne ke saath-saath panchayatiraj main bhi unka pratinidhitiv badha he
 Which became the reason for jealousy of Muslims in other societies, through this, right-wing forces got a chance to spread their foothold
 lekin mujhe ummid he ki dakshinpanthi takate bharat main bahut lambey samay tak nahin rah sakengi
 Leave Progressive Thinking and Become Progressive Muslim Professor Mohammad Sajjad says - There is a very delicate phase in front of Muslims, in such a situation, they should be self-conscious
 roodhiwaadee soch se upar uthakar progressive soch ke saath aage aana hoga
 Not only this, like a common citizen, vote silently on the party of your choice, but question all parties, not only BJP
 iske alaava desh ke musalamaanon ko desh ke baaki samaaj ke saath milakar apane mudde uthaane chahie
 Instead of uniting on an orthodox issue like the Shahabans, unite on concrete economic issues
 kisaanon kii samasya ,vikaas ke mudde or saamaajik nyaay kii ladaai main barabari se khadey hon
 Religious freedom under threat Salman Nadvi says that even after 71 years of independence, Muslims of the country have to give proof of their patriotism
 jabaki desh kii aazaadee main sabase zyada qurbaaniyaan musalamaanon ne hi di hai
 Despite this our loyalty has been doubted
 maujuuda daur main musalamaanon kii dharmik aazaadee ko target kiya ja rahaa he, kabhi teen talaak, to kabhi kaaman civil code ke jariye
 Not only this, madrasas are being targeted
 sampradayik takaton ke hausale is kadar buland hai ki saream musalamaanon ko maaraa ja rahaa he
 The social fabric of the country has deteriorated
 aise main aazaadee ke myne nahin rah jate hai
 The loss of Muslims more than Modi, Nehru did to former MP Ilyas Azmi - Jawaharlal Nehru has damaged the lives of Muslims between 1947 and 1964, so much so that Narendra Modi cannot reach even in fifty years
 nehru ke daur main musalamaanon kii haalat is kadar kharaab ho chuki thi ki chaar muslim ek saath khadey hokar baat nahin kar sakate the
 The Muslim community had completely fallen victim to the feeling
 naukari, shiksha or raajnneeti main musalamaanon kii hissedari puri tarah se khatm kar di gai thi
 In this conspiracy by Nehru, Maulana Hussain Ahmed Madani, who was the president of Jamiat ulama-e-hind, was also involved
 nehru or indira ke daur main taat ke parade or gandi galiyaan muslim bastiyon kii pahchaan thi
 Azmi, the Golden Periodilias of Muslims, says that Dr
 in regaining the lost confidence of Muslims
 faridi kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 Through the Muslim Majlis, he eliminated the feeling-e-kamrti from inside the Muslims
 aazaadee ke 71 saal main musalamaanon ke liye sabase golden period 1977 se 2009 tak tha
 Meanwhile, the share of Muslims in all the social, economic and political sectors of the country increased and better steps were taken towards development
 desh kaa musalmaan baaki samaaj ke saath khadaa hua, 2009 ke baad phir musalamaanon ke khilaaf maahaul banaaya gaya he
 At present there is Modi's government, some things are definitely going against the Muslims, but like Nehru's era, Muslims cannot be pushed to the margins, because now the 1947 era is no longer Muslim
 aaj kaa musalmaan marane-katane ke liye taiyaar he
 Will not back down in the fight for his rights
 loktantr kii aazaadee par khatraprofessor imtiyaaj ahamed kehete hai ki mulk kii aazaadee ke samay jo aazaadee ke myne or pariklpana thi
 In today's situation, it is under threat
 unity diversity jo hamaari saamaajik khubi he, use peeche le jaaya ja rahaa he
 The result is that along with our freedom, the country's democratic system is also under threat
 1947 main jo aazaadee mili he vah jivit rahegi bhi yaa nahin
 Muslims, who have lived in a sense of insecurity, have made progress in the 71 years of independence of the country
 vah sarkari str ke jariye nahin, balki durbhaagya se vah baazaaroo takaton kii dein rahi he
 Muslims have become equal to the progressive and middle class by taking advantage of the market potential
 lekin sampradayik dangon ke jariye sampatti kaa atake bhi use jhelana padaa he
 Things have become very fragile in the last two-three years
 alpsankhyak hone ke naate musalamaanon ko jo suraksha milani chahie thi, durbhaagya se wo suraksha kam hui he
 They feel that the freedom they got through the Constitution at the time of independence will be saved or not
 musalmaan asuraksha kii bhaavana main ji rahaa he
 Today, Hindutva thinking and dictatorial trend is coming inside the state, its contribution is that the gaurakshakas are killing people publicly
 71 saal pehle jo aazaadee mili thi us aazaadee main ab saans lenaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 Promotion of Muslims: Former Rajya Sabha member and journalist Shahid Siddiqui says that in 71 years, the country's Muslim has moved forward and is progressing in every sphere of life
 is yakeen ke saath ki uskaa bhavishya desh main mahfuj he
 After the creation of Bangladesh, the Muslims of the country have stopped looking around and become part of the mainstream to pursue their future
 yakeenan aaj bahut-si samasyaayein or chunautiyaan hai, lekin badalte hue maahaul main musalamaanon kii nai nasl apni soch or kaam main badlaav chaahati he yahi vajah he ki aaj vishwa main musalmaan badtareen haalat main saamana kar rahaa he
 In India, it is neither associated with any fundamentalist thinking nor is it on any terrorist path
 vah puri tarah se bharat ke samvidhan par bharosa rakhkar nae raste or nai duniya kii talash main he
 There are only two ways to fight the challenges in the current era, firstly education and secondly financially strong
 inhen donon raaston par chalakar musalmaan andhera dur kar roshni bikher saktaa he
 Former Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa was sworn in as the new Prime Minister in the President's Secretariat on Friday evening
 raashtrapati maitreepala sirisena neranil vikramsingheko hataakar purv raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe ko nayaa pradhanmantri banaaya he
 However, Ranil Wickramasinghe says that he still remains the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka
 kaise hongebharatake saath sambandhrajpakshe ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad bharat ke saath srilanka ke rishte kaise rahenge, yah sawaal mukhar ho gaya he
 Sri Lanka has been India's closest neighbor, so even the smallest incident there matters to India
 haalanki shuukravaar ko bharat ne saaf kar diya ki srilanka main koun pradhanmantri banataa he, yah uskaa aantarik maamla he
 Two recent incidents in Sri Lanka are considered to be very important in the Indian context
 kuch din pehle raashtrapati sirisena or ranil vikramsinghe ke bich cabinet meeting ke dauraan bhidnt ho gai thi
 Quoting sources, the Colombo-based Daily Mirror newspaper claimed that a dispute between the president and the prime minister was built on the construction of the East Container Terminal at Colombo Port with Indian investment
 bharat-srilanka ke bich chinacabinet baithak srilanka ke port or shipping mantri mahinda samarasinghe ne cabinet ko prastaav diya tha ki east container coast ko viksit karne kaa daayitv srilanka port athurity ko diya jaae
 At the same time, Sri Lankan Development Strategy and International Trade Minister Malik Samaravikrama, during the cabinet meeting, favored making port from Indian investment
 raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ke bich vivaad kii sthiti tab khadi hui jab pradhanmantri ranil vikramsinghe ne vyapaar mantri ke prastaav ko maanane kii vakaalat kii
 It is worth noting that before the cabinet meeting, the President of Sri Lanka had opposed the leasing of Hambantota Port to a Chinese company
 ab dobaaraa jab rajpakshe pradhanmantri pad par baith gaye hai, to bharat-srilanka sambandhon kii chaanbin shuru ho gai he ki srilanka ke pariprekshya main donon deshon ke rishte kaise rahenge
 It is important to know here that before Rajapaksa was removed from Sri Lanka's power, then the main reason behind it was the proposal to lease Hambantota Port China
 hambantota kaa kya hogasaal 2015 main bharat ne 'bade bhai' kii bhoomika adaa karte hue sirisena or vikramsinghe ke bich sulah-salaakat karai thi or rajpakshe ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya gaya tha
 The matter was related to Hambantota Port because Rajapaksa had given the green signal to build Colombo Port while allowing China to do it
 tab yah bhi tay hua tha ki china ke pandubbi jahaaj srilankai jalakshetra main deraa daalenge
 However, later Rajapaksa was ousted from Sri Lanka's power
 aaj phir rajpakshe jab srilanka ke pradhanmantri banaae gaye hai, to sawaal khadey ho rahe hai ki hambantota or china kaa kya hoga
 First of all, there is another incident in which President Sirisena accused India's intelligence agency RAW of plotting the murder
 haalanki baad main unhone iskaa sara thikra media ke maathe phod kar pallaa jhaad liya tha
 a few days later, Ranil Wickremesinghe came to Delhi to talk to PM Modi to expedite India-backed projects, including the eastern terminal project in Sri Lanka
 baatcheet kya hui, iskaa puraa vivaran to nahin mil paaya, lekin shuukravaar ko achaanak vikramsinghe ko hataakar rajpakshe ko pradhanmantri bananaa bharat ke liye chintaa kaa sabab jarur mana ja rahaa he
 Is Rajapaksa in support of India? However, media reports also feature prominently the two meetings of Rajapaksa and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which PM Modi took time to meet Rajapaksa during his Sri Lankan visit
 rajpakshe bharat bhi aae or piem modi se mulaakaat kii
 Even more important, before coming to India, Rajapaksa sent the former foreign minister and his party's spokesman GL Paris to India and insisted on deepening the relationship between the two countries
 in sabake bich, isiti ke alaava or bhi kai project hai, jise bharat vahaan shuru karne vaala he, jaise-trinkomali oil tanks farms, jafana main palaali airport, hambantota main mattala airport or colombo ke paas alenji terminal kaa nirmaan
 Recently, Indian companies got the contract for the housing project, which was earlier with Chinese companies
 ye kuch aise badlaav hai, jo bharat or srilanka ke bich ranneetik rishte ko tay karenge kyonki srilanka main bharat ke kai ranneetik hit daanv par lage hai

 international court of justise (ICJ) kulbhushan jadhav ko pakistan main sunai gai faansee kii sajaa ke khilaaf bharat kii apil par apana faisla aaj (guuruuvaar ko) sunayega
 According to government sources, the international court will give its verdict today at around 3:30 pm Indian time
 darasal, kulbhushan jadhav ke maamle main beete somvaar ko yahaan antarrashtriya nyaayalay (isije) main bharat or pakistan ke bich joardaar bahes hui thi
 India demanded an immediate adjournment of Jadhav's death sentence, while Pakistan accused India of using this global institution as a 'political platform' through an application of 'false views'
 ullekhneey he ki bharat jadhav ke maamle ko antarashtriya nyaayalay main le gaya he or pakistan par vienna samjhauta kaa ulanghan karne tathaa leshmaatr saboot ke bagaiyr jadhav ko doshi tehraane ke liye betuka mukadmaa chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The two neighboring countries met face-to-face here 18 years ago, when Pakistan sought its intervention in the case of the killing of its naval aircraft
 donon pakshon kii daleelein sunne ke baad nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki vah asthaayee upaay ke liye bharat ke anurodh par yathashighra apana aadesh jari karegaa
 The court said, "the date on which the order will be issued in the public meeting will be informed to both the parties"
 bharat ne jadhav kii maut kii sajaa ko fouran sthagit karne kii maang karte hue ashanka jataai he ki pakistan isije main sunwaayee puri hone se pehle hi unhen faansee de saktaa he
 India strongly argued the ICJ hearing in the 46-year-old former Navy officer
 jadhav ko pichley saal teen march ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha or pakistan kii ek sainya adaalat ne kathith jasusi evam vidhvansak gatividhiyon main sanlipt rahane ke aarope main unhen maut kii sajaa sunai thi

 There is an immediate danger of being hanged even before the decision is taken
 bharat kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe mukhya vakil harish salve ne kaha ki aise main jab yah nyaayalay apil par sunwaayee kar rahaa he, maut kii sajaa kaa kriyanvan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Otherwise, it would be a violation of the Vienna Agreement
 bharat kii daleel ke baad pakistan ne sanyukt raashtra kii sarvocch nyaayik sanstha main apni daleel main kaha tha ki jadhav par bharat kii arji gairajaruri or galat tareeke se vyakhya vaali he tathaa ise avashya khaarij kiya janaa chahie
 In fact, in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, there was a strong debate between India and Pakistan in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) here on Monday
 bharat ne jadhav kii maut kii sajaa fouran sthagit karne kii maang kii, jabaki pakistan ne bharat par ‘mithyaa vichaar’ vaali ek arji ke jariye is vaishvik sanstha kaa ‘raajnneetik manch’ ke rup main istemaal karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 It is noteworthy that India has taken Jadhav's case to the International Court of Justice and accused Pakistan of violating the Vienna Agreement and of absurd prosecution for convicting Jadhav without having little evidence
 donon padosi deshon kaa 18 saal pehle yahaan aamanaa-saamana hua tha, jab pakistan ne apni nausena ke vimaan ko maar giraane ke maamle main isse hastkshep kii maang kii thi
 After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the court said that it would issue its order as soon as possible on India's request for a temporary measure
 nyaayalay ne kaha, 'saarvajanik baithak main jis taarikh ko aadesh jari kiya jayega, us bare main donon pakshon ko soochna de di jaaegi'
 India has demanded immediate adjournment of Jadhav's death sentence, fearing that Pakistan may hang him before the ICJ hearing is completed
 nausena ke 46 varshiya purv adhikari ke maamle main isije ke sunwaayee shuru karne par bharat ne joardaar daleel pesh kii
 Jadhav was arrested on March 3 last year and sentenced to death by a Pakistan military court for his alleged involvement in espionage and subversive activities
 tippaniyan Deepak Mittal, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, told the ICJ in his opening remarks, "jadhav was not empowered to get appropriate legal aid and diplomatic help
" faisla hone se pehle hi unhen faansee die jane kaa ek fori khatra mandara rahaa he'
 Chief Counsel Harish Salve, representing India, said that the death sentence cannot be executed when this Court is hearing an appeal
 nahin to, yah vienna samjhauta kaa ulanghan hoga
 After India's arguments, Pakistan had said in its plea in the highest judicial body of the United Nations that India's application on Jadhav is irresponsible and misinterpreted and must be rejected
 ullekhneey he ki bharat jadhav ke maamle ko antarashtriya nyaayalay main le gaya he or pakistan par vienna samjhauta kaa ulanghan karne tathaa leshmaatr saboot ke bagaiyr jadhav ko doshi tehraane ke liye betuka mukadmaa chalaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The two neighboring countries met face-to-face here 18 years ago, when Pakistan sought its intervention in the case of the killing of its naval aircraft
 donon pakshon kii daleelein sunne ke baad nyaayalay ne kaha tha ki vah asthaayee upaay ke liye bharat ke anurodh par yathashighra apana aadesh jari karegaa
 The court said, "the date on which the order will be issued in the public meeting will be informed to both the parties"

 - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) March 25, 2019 Captain Marvel, which was released in many languages including Hindi, is also reported to be doing good business in India
 kul milakar march ab tak kaaphi acha sabit hua he
 Notebook will release more wild this Friday
 ho saktaa he march kaa ant ek or hit ke saath ho
 At present, Team India is 'looking'
 yah talash jaruri he, kyonki is team kaa kuch nahin, bahut kuch kho gaya he
 Where are lost, why is lost and how will they be searched for, this is a big question
 is talash kii shuruyaat kerani hogi team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni se
 Dhoni was in front of everyone till Ahmedabad, but lost after the Mumbai Test
 unki shakhsiyat, unki captaini dhunde nahin mil rahi he
 The loss of defeat in Ahmedabad is definitely big, but the reality is that the team has lost only one Test in the series
 ab baari he palatwaar karne kii
 The biggest responsibility for the counterattack is on the shoulders of Captain Dhoni
 unpar team ko ekajute rakhane kii jimmedaari he
 It is the responsibility of keeping the dressing room tied up, the responsibility of correcting their mistakes, the responsibility of encouraging the team and finally the responsibility of winning the team
 dhoni ke kariyar main kolkata kaa test ek mile kaa pathar hone vaala he, isliye ye talash kolkata se pehle hi khatm kerani hogi
 Because the real face of a captain is seen in defeat, not in success and it is here that Dhoni has to show what clay he is made of
 unhen pruv karnaa hoga
 They have to show that they take tough decisions, not decisions
 unhen dikhaanaa hoga ki agar fitbaque hoga to dhoni is javaabi carrawai main sabase aage honge
 Actually Team India is looking for Dhoni who used to change the attitude of the match in a blink of an eye, whose other name was Karishma, who is not a magician
 
 
 
 It was magic itself
 jisane bharat ko tii-20 or vanade main champion bana diya
 Mahi may be the loser in Mumbai, but the whole team stands shoulder to shoulder with him
 bhartiya cricket ko chaahane vaale us har ek cheez ko talashna chaahate hai jo unhen khushi de or team india ko jeet
 But this quest is not so easy
 gaadi patari se utar chuki he or jo halaat hai, team ke liye kambek karnaa din-ba-din mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 The truth is that the players do not know their character and the team management is completely shattered: the captain first asks for the pitch of his choice and criticizes him for not winning
 
 
 
 Moreover, on other turning wickets, Indian spinners do not find any way of success and the captain does not even know which bowler to put on the front
 opening main akraman naheembhartiya team ke paas do aise opebers hai, jo ye kai baar sabit kar chuke hai ki pich or halaat unke liye myne nahin rakhte hai
 But, the opening Test partnership of 4 in the first innings and 30 runs in the second innings of Mumbai Test
 aise main ballebaaji kii neenv hi hill gai
 The time is again to prove himself
 in donon ne team india ko agar is vakt mushkilon se nahin nikaala, to itnaa bada kad kis kaam kaa?majboot nahin middle ordermumbai main haar kii badi vajah middle order kaa flop hona bhi tha or ab kamyaabi kii talash main ye ek bada barier sabit ho saktaa he
 In the second innings, the Indian team's score was 37 runs at the loss of one wicket, but as Pujara left, the situation became so bad that the team's score reached 92 for 6 wickets
 ab jarurat he middle order ko bhi majbootee se datane kii
 It is not that the quest for success cannot be completed
 takat hogi to talash bhi puri jarur hogi
 Need only to return to basics
 bhartiya purush basketbaal team iran ke khilaaf group-i main apana lagaataar doosraa match haar kar buudhvaar ko 17wein asian khelon se baahar ho gai
 Iran defeated India 76-41
 kwalifire round main apane group main sheersh par rahane vaali bhartiya team ko apane pehle match main mangalvaar ko philippines se bhi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The Indian team, which performed brilliantly in the last moments against the Philippines, continued to lose their momentum in the last moments against Iran
 pehle quarter main iran 22-16 ke saath keval chah ank aage tha
 By the end of the second quarter, Iran took a 10–28 lead over India with 38–28
 tisare quarter main iran ne behtareen khel dikhaate hue aath ke mukaable 20 ank arjeet kiye or bhartiya team ko mukaable se kareeb-kareeb baahar kar diya
 After this, Indian players performed even more disappointing in the fourth quarter and could only score five points
 bharat ke captain amritpal singh ne sarvaadhik 10 ank hasil kiye
 Special Bhriguvanshi scored nine while Narendra Kumar Grewal scored eight
 iran kii ore se captain mohammadsamad nik khahbaharaami or hamed ehdadi ne team ke liye sarvaadhik 16-16 ank jutaaye
 Demand to make Tamil official language, BJP leader said - why DMK did not do this, DMK Chief Stalin has demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make Tamil the official language of India
 stallin ne kaha ki jaisaa ki piem khud sweekaar karte hai ki tamil duniya kii sabase puraani bhashaa he, isliye centre kii jimmedaari he ki vah bhashaa ko manyata den
 He also appealed to the Madras High Court to make Tamil as an administrative language
 stallin ne piem modi se tamil ko raashtra kii aadhikarik bhashaa banane ke liye sabhi aavashyak kadam uthaane or isamen garv karne kii maang kii
 He said that we are happy to see that Modi is praising the Tamil language on various forums
 unhone kaha ki tamil pehle se hi kai deshon kii aadhikarik bhashaa he
 On this i would like to draw the attention of the PM
 ham tamil logon kii piem modi se bahut ummiden hai
 The kind of affection he shows towards the Tamil language is expected to become practical soon
 somvaar ko piem modi ne chennai mensamyukt raashtra main die bhaashanko bhi yaad kiya, jisamen unhone kaha tha tamil duniya kii sabase puraani bhashaa main se ek he
 After his statement, this became a topic of discussion in America
 vahiin stallin ke bayaan par bijepi ke narayan tirupati ne kaha ki 1saal 1996 se 2005 tak diemke kya kar rahi thi
 Why did they not take steps
 tamil ko aadhikarik bhashaa banane par court hi faisla le sakati he
 Enthusiasts over corporation elections intensified in Delhi
 parisemen ko lekar dilli chunaav ayog ne sari partiyon se mulaakaat kii jisame aam aadmi party, congress, bijepi or bahujan samaaj party ke netaa shaamil the
 In fact, the Congress and BJP had raised objections about the delimitation, on which the Election Commission called all the parties for the meeting
 isamen jansankhya ko lekar ward kaa chayan or essi siton ko lekar jald ghoshnaa par vichaar hua, kyonki bijepi or congress kaa maananaa tha ki chunaav ko lekar ab zyada samay nahin bachaa he isliye is par jald faisla hona chahie
 BJP and Congress stated their problems on many issues
 jahaan congress or bijepi donon partiyon ne ward kii jansankhya ko lekar mudda uthaaya
 He said that if the population of a ward is more than 8 xxrep 4 0 , then in some it is below 5 xxrep 4 0 , while the Election Commission had talked about making a ward with a population of 6 xxrep 4 0 
 vahiin essi seat ko lekar bijepi or congress ke alag-alag sur the
 Congress demands that in every assembly seat one ward should be for SC, BJP wants SC seat based on SC population, that is, if 3 out of four wards of an assembly, SC population will be more then all three seats
 Should make SC seat
 lekin sabhi partiyaan chunaav samay par karaane ke mudde par ek dikh rahi thim
 Actually, BJP is in possession of all the three Nigmo, if the SC seat is decided on the basis of population then the BJP will not have much problem, but if one SC seat is fixed in an assembly then it will decide the fight for tickets in BJP
 BJP wants to escape
 baharhaal chunaav ayog isse par faisla legaa
 Rashtriya Lok Samata Party leader Upendra Kushwaha has said that the agencies are investigating the allegations against the Lalu Yadav family
 jo bhi fact hoga, vah saamne aa jayega
 But those who used to read the lesson of morality to Nitish Kumar, now show it by applying it to yourself
 unhone kaha, 'nitish kumaar ne lalu yadav ji ko kaha he ki ve tathyon ke aarope kaa jawaab saamne rakhen or laluji nitish kumaar ko samajhaaye
 The question is not what Lalu Yadav is saying
 sawaal ye he ki nitish kumaar lalu yadav kii safaai se sahamat hai yaa nahin, kyonki unhone lalu yadav ko kaha he ki ve tathyon ke saath jawaab den
 People of Bihar and the country do not agree with Lalu Yadav's cleanliness
 ab dekhnaa he nitish kumaar karrwai karte hai yaa naitikta kii sikh sirf dusron ko dete hai
 He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and no BJP leader are involved in this
 agar koi maamla agency ke saamne laayaa jaayegaa to uski jaanch kii jaaegi
 Therefore, it is wrong to accuse Prime Minister Modi ji and BJP
 lalu yadav khud hi kehete rahe hai ki nitish kumaar ke daant munh main nahin, unke aant (pet) main hai
 Now Lalu Yadav is being injured by Nitish Kumar's intestinal teeth, so Lalu Yadav himself knows what is happening from where
 'unhone kaha, 'nitish kumaar kab dosti karte hai kabadushmani karte hai,isko pahchaanana bada mushkil kaam he
 Very few people recognize him as such
 haa meri samaj ye kahati he ki lalu yadav, nitish kumaar ke is rup ko pahchaan gaye hai
 Where the boat will go, the boat will sink, said whether the BJP will support Nitish Kumar or not is a hypothetical question
 nitish kumaarchaahe idhar aaen yaa udhar jaaen, jahaan bhi jaaenge, wo naav doobana tay he
 He said that BJP is his rival party
 agar uske paas koi matter aayega to wo zarur uthaayegi isamen bijepi kaa koi dosha nahin hai, lekin lalu yadav ke jo dost hai
 Nitish Kumar is a big deal if he is raising questions
 lalu yadav ko dekhnaa chahie nitish kumaar ke bare main

 Mother is another name for sacrifice and sacrifice
 vahi to he jo duniyabar kii pareshaaniyon ko apane anchal ke chor main baandh leti he taaki uske bacchon ko koi takalif na ho
 To be honest, after becoming a mother, respect for the mother increased
 maa banane kii raah aasaan nahin hoti
 The real smile starts only after becoming a mother
 mujhe bhi maa banane ke baad hi ehsaas hua ki meri maa ne kitni takaliphen uthaayi hongi
 When the feeling of being in the womb came in my arms, all the happiness of the world was found
 meri puri duniya ham dono main hi simat gai
 Even after all the trouble, after seeing a glimpse of it, everything became beautiful
 use apni ankhon ke saamne dhire-dhire bada hote dekhnaa ek alag si khushi detaa he
 How many times running after the child, it felt like that just now
 
 
 thakne lagi hum par maa har baar tumhaara khyaal aa jaataa he or hausala bad jaataa he
 Telling lullabies, sleeping, picking and feeding with love, you must have done all this for me too
 tumne bhi to sabakuch akele hi sambhala hoga
 Family and we brothers and sisters
 tumhen dekhakar kabhi laga hi nahin kitum kisi pareshaani se gujri hogi
 You always explained to me the difference between right and wrong
 dur rahete hue bhi hameshaa mere liye vakt nikaala
 Today, even after becoming a mother, i consider myself a child in front of you and you also did not let me grow up
 maa banane ke baad bahut si chijen badal gai hai
 You will believe that presence has come in me
 aaj madars de ke din yahi ummid karti hunki tumhe dekhakar maine maa ke jis rup ko samajha he, vahi rup main mere bachche ko de sakuun
 May i give him the same love and values that you have given me

 a Canadian man with prosthetic legs has set an amazing example by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in the African continent
 aisa kar is vyakti ne un doctoron kaa kaha galat sabit kar diya jinhone kaha tha ki ‘vah kabhi bhi samaaj kaa sakriy sadsy nahin ban saktaa’
 31-year-old Spencer West had both his legs amputated in childhood due to a hereditary disease called 'secondary agenesis'
 unke sharir kaa nichalaa hissaa lakwagrast ho gaya tha
 But the physical disorder did not allow West to become his weakness
 canada ke toronto shahar ke rahane vaale west ne mangalvaar ko samudr tal se 6,000 meter kii oonchai vaale mount kilimanjaro parvat par chadhaai kii
 Spencer described it as an amazing personal success
 tippaniyan "touching the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro was the biggest mental and physical challenge for me," said West
 lekin aisa karke maine apane aap main or dusron main vishwaas karne kii bhaavana ko prabal kar diya
 "it was a big challenge physically because i did most of the climbing with the help of hands which put a lot of pressure on my shoulders and arms," said West
 ’’ is chadhaai main west ke saath unke do sabake achche dost david johnson or elex mirs bhi the
 The purpose of these people was to raise money for 'free the Children', an organization that supplies water for hundreds of people in Kenya through this ascent
 samajaseva ke alaava west aisa kar un doctoron ko galat sabit karnaa chaahate the jinhone unke mata-pita se kaha tha ki unka betaa kabhi bhi samaaj kaa sakriy sadsy nahin ho saktaa
 West was then five years old

 The lower part of his body was paralyzed
 lekin shaareerik vikaar ko west ne apni kamajori nahin banane diya
 West, a resident of the city of Toronto, Canada, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro at 6,000 meters above sea level on Tuesday
 spencer ne ise ek adbhut vyaktigat safalataa bataaya
 The comments west ne kaha, ‘‘mount kilimanjaro ke shikhar ko choona mere liye sabase badi maansik or shaareerik chunauti thi
 But by doing this i reinforced the feeling of believing in myself and others
 ’’ west ne kaha, ‘‘shaareerik rup se yah badi chunauti thi kyonki maine zyaadaatar chadhaai haathon ke sahare kii jisase mere kandhon or baahon par bahut dabaav padaa
 West was accompanied by two of his best friends, David Johnson and Alex Meers, in this climb
 in logon kaa uddeshy is chadhaai ke madhyam se kenya main saikadon logon ke liye jal kii aapurti karne vaale ek sanghathan ‘free di children’ ke liye paise jutanaa tha

 When i became part of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) in the year 1963, i was sent to the Free University of Brussels, so that i could learn my 'compulsory foreign language' - French
 hua yah ki pehle audio-vizual teaching course ke liye hamaari class prayog kaa vishay thi, so, hamaari class ke saath ek bhashaa manovigyaani ko jod diya gaya, taaki yah dekha ja sake ki vibhinn rashtriyataon - syrian, turki, german, italian, peruvian, cubai, japani american - ke logon ko samete yah class, jise ek sirf french bolne vaale shikshak ke saath bitha diya gaya he, bhashaa ko kis tarah pakad paati he
 It soon became clear that both Indians - KP Balakrishnan and i - were ahead of the rest of the class, and we both learned the fundamentals of the language within a few weeks
 maine us manovigyaani se poocha, aisa kaise ho paa rahaa he - kya isliye ki ham baaki logon se zyaada hoshiyaar hai, yaa hamaari prishthbhumi main kuch aisa he, jisaki badaulat ham ek videshi bhashaa ko baaki logon ke mukaable jaldi sikh rahe hai
 He said that the reason for overtaking both of us is very simple compared to the rest of the class
 bhashaa manovigyaan ne bahut samay pehle hi yah sthapit kiya tha ki jo log do bhashaaen sikhte hue bade hote hai, ve vayask hokar (jisaki cat-of aayu 35 varsh he) teesri bhashaa un logon kii tulana main jaldi sikh sakate hai, jo sirf ek bhashaa sikhkar vayask hue
 My classmate KP Balakrishnan's mother tongue was Malayalam, while my mother tongue is Tamil, we both had a good grasp of Hindi as well, and of course we both knew English as well, so French was the fourth language for both of us, so That is why we were brought up by everyone else, especially Americans (who do not even know English correctly, and who are taught a different accent called 'american')
 jo bhi iesces banate hai, unhen apni anivaary videshi bhashaa is had tak seekhni padi he, taaki ve maukhik tathaa likhit pariksha paas kar saken, or tabhi unhen seva main niyamit kiya jaataa he
 Even before finishing the first phase of training in Mussoorie, we essentially had to pass oral and written tests in Hindi as well
 so, bhale hi ham sabane apni civil sarvice pariksha angrezi main paas kii thi, phir bhi niyamit rup se seva main aane se pehle hamen kam se kam teen bhashaaon - angrezi, hindi tathaa ek videshi bhashaa - par acha-khaasaa adhikaar hasil karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, even though those days have passed almost 40 years ago, when i had the opportunity to speak French every day, even today, if i get interviewed in French, or someone comes to speak French, i am surprised that How easily does the French return to my tongue
 bilkul isi tarah iees (bhartiya prashasnic seva) ke hamaare saathiyon ko anivaary rup se hindi kii pariksha to uteern kerani hi padati thi, balki apane griharajya se baahar tainaati kii sthiti (jo lagbhag do-tihaai maamalon main hota hi he) main niyamit ho paane se pehle us rajya kii bhashaa bhi seekhni padati thi, jahaan tainaati kii gai he
 When i think of the two most successful chief secretaries of Uttar Pradesh, Kalyanakrishnan and TSR Subramaniam, it becomes clear that one has to learn the language of the state if one is to progress as an officer of the administrative service
 udhar, tamilnadu main mere sansadeey kshetra main bhi main bahut-se esadm or collector se mila, jinamein se kai hindi-bhashi rajyon se the, or unka tamil gyaan acha athwa prashansaneey tha (jabaki aamtaur par bharatiyon ke liye tamil siikhnaa asaadhaaran rup se kathin hota he, kyonki anya bhartiya bhashaaon ke vipareet tamil kii jaden sanskrit se nahin hai, or us par sanskrit kaa prabhaav bhi maamuli he)
 i think this is what we have through our experiences to solve the C-SAT problem
 aptitude test (aptitude Test) sirf angrezi main hi kyon karavaaya janaa chahie? yadi ham kehete hai, aptitude test kinhin bhi do bhartiya bhashaaon (jinamein se ek angrezi ho sakati he) kaa gyaan jaanchega, or 200 si-sat ankon ko in donon bhashaaon main baraabar baanta jayega, to yah sabhi abhyarthiyon ke liye ek samaan plateform ban jayega, chaahe unki bhashaa koi bhi ho
 It is clear that all the candidates will be proficient in one of these two languages, and some will be less proficient in the other language
 so, kisi ko bhi bhashaa praveenta jaanchane kii pariksha main anaavashyak laabh nahin mil paaegaa, or yadi in donon bhashaaon main se angrezi ko nikaal bhi diya jaae, tab bhi sabhi ke liye avasar samaan honge, kyonki prayek abhyarthi ko do bhashaaon main praveenta rakhni hi hogi
 In fact, this will encourage Hindi speakers to learn Tamil or Malayalam or Bangla or Oriya or Mizo or Assamese, thereby strengthening national integrity
 apane ek puraane blog main maine tamil saansad ira sejiyaan kaa bayaan uddhrut kiya tha, jo unhone atal bihari vaajapeyi ke bayaan - prayek dakshini rajya main hindi prachaar sabha maujuud he - ke jawaab main diya tha
 Ira said, "and how many Tamil Prachara Sabha meetings do you have in Uttar Pradesh, and how many Malayalam Prachara Sabha are in Madhya Pradesh
 
 
 ?" yadi si-sat aptitude test ke liye kisi duusari aadhunik bhartiya bhashaa main praveenta aavashyak ho jaaegi, to jo log angrezi ko samrajyavad kii dein maanate hai, unhen kisi bhi duusari bhartiya bhashaa - telugu, shaayad konkani, kannada yaa urdu - seekhney kii chhot mil jaaegi
 But the question arises as to what will be the Tamil-speaking person who chose Malayalam as the second language for C-SAT? Who understands these two languages outside Tamil Nadu and Kerala? How will he discuss Tamil-speaking with his northern, eastern, western and north-eastern colleagues? The answer is simple
 seva main niyamit hone ke liye abhyarthi ko anivaary rup se hindi kii pariksha uteern kerani hogi, or yadi uski tainaati maharashtra yaa gujarat main ho jaati he, to use marathi yaa gujarati kaa bhi kaamchalaoo gyaan hona hi chahie
 For any administrator, the linguistic competence associated with his / her functions is absolutely necessary
 uskaa angrezi sahitya or sahityakaron kaa gyaan uske kisi kaam nahin aayega, yadi use arunachal pradesh jaakar kaam karnaa padaa
 The question here is not in Hindi and English
 yadi aisa hota to ham angrezi se chhutkaaraa paa sakate the
 But those who do not have Hindi as their mother tongue are concerned that if 42 percent of the Hindi-speaking people will be given preference over 58 percent of non-hindi speakers (for whom Hindi is the learned language, not the mother tongue), then the Hindi language will be preferred over non-hindi speakers
 Permanent dominance will be established, and we will reach the position that Pakistan was before 1971, with the eastern part of Urdu speaking That minorities tried to establish permanent linguistic dominance Bengali majority
 isi vajah se gaiyr-hindibhashi rajya angrezi se hone vaala nuksaan bardaasht kar lete hai, lekin vah nuksaan bardaasht karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hote, jo unke rajya main alpsankhyakon kii bhashaa hindi ko ekmaatr aadhikarik bhashaa bana dene se gaiyr-hindibhashi janata ko hoga
 We can also achieve a level playing field by looking at the non-parity seen after allowing different languages, if the C-SAT Aptitude Test is taken in any of the two modern Indian languages as the candidate wishes, and one language to be English Essentials be removed
 hindi athwa kisi bhi anya bhartiya bhashaa ko si-sat main ekmaatr bhashaa banaakar angrezibhashiyon ko dur phenk dene kii is koshish kaa purvottar ke rajyon main kadaa virodh hoga (udaahranarth nagaland main angrezi rajkeey bhashaa he, jabaki vahaan 16 sthaneey boliyaan boli jaati hai)
 It will also be opposed in many other places, where it has been said that India, which has won the Nobel and Man Booker Prizes by winning English literature, has English in the form of Indianism, irrespective of the origin of the language
 bhartiyata main dhaali ji chuki angrezi utani hi bhartiya bhashaa he, jitani america main british angrezi kaa american rup he
 (by the way, even in England, English language 'murder' has been done in hundreds of ways - Professor Higgins said in My Fair Lady, "oh
 
 
 angrez log apane bacchon ko sahi tareeke se bolnaa kyon nahin sikhaa sakate
 
 
 "or note that anti-english linguistics was at the root of the Scottish and Welsh independence struggle that took place in the 21st century)
 yah bhi dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki sabhi anya parikshaayen (jinke ank antim pariksha main gine jate hai) angrezi, hindi yaa kisi bhi anusuchit bhashaa main likhi ja sakati hai
 So even if we remove the English requirement from the aptitude test, we are still giving the candidate a benefit of only 70 out of 200 marks, while by scoring a total of 70 marks out of 200, he is eligible to appear in the main examination anyway
 Can do, where knowledge of English is not necessary at all
 lekin yadi ye 70 ank bhi angrezi na jaanane vaale yaa angrezi seekhney ke liye katai anicchhuk abhyarthiyon ke gale nahin utarate, in 70 ankon ko jane dijie, lekin yaad rahe, seva main niyamit hone se pehle unhen do or bhashaaen seekhni hongi, yadi ve hindibhashi hai, or yadi ve hindibhashi nahin hai, to unhen teen anya bhashaaen (angrezi, hindi or ek rajya kii yaa videshi bhashaa) seekhni padengi
 However, if the English imperative is necessary to remove the frustration of the candidates sitting on strike in Mukherjee Nagar, let it be so

 bies yediurppa bhale hi karnataka ke mukhyamantri pad par virajman ho gaye hai, lekin unki satta kii kursi kaa paaya philhal ladkadhaata dikh rahaa he
 After the Supreme Court's decision, Yeddyurappa has to pass the majority of the litmus test in the House today
 sutron ke mutabik agar bijepi jaadui aankade ko nahin chhu paati he to yediurppa ek bhavuk bhaashan dekar vahaan se nikal jaaenge
 They can then resign and will not face a majority test
 aapako bataa den ki bijepi ke liye sadan main 112 vidhayakon kaa jaadui aankada juta paanaa ek badi chunauti he
 The congress-jds has kept a watch on each of its mlas and the Supreme Court is eyeing the entire matter
 rajyapal vajubhai vaala ne yediurppa sarkaar ko shapath bhale hi dilaa di ho, lekin aisi paanch vajahen hai jinke chalate yediurppa kii sarkaar kaa janaa tay mana ja rahaa he!number game bijepi ke paksh main nahinkarnataka vidhansabha main 222 siton ke liye chunaav hue hai
 112 seats will be needed for a majority
 bijepi ke 104 vidhayak jitkar aae hai
 37 mlas of JDS and 78 mlas of Congress and mlas of 3 other parties have won
 yediurppa ko bahumat sabit karne ke liye 8 atirikt vidhayakon kii jarurat padegi
 However, Kumaraswamy of JDS has won two seats and became an MLA
 aise main unhen ek seat se istipha dena padegaa
 In such a situation, BJP will need 111 seats to prove majority in terms of 221 seats
 aise main bahumat kaa number game bijepi ke paksh main nahin dikh rahaa he
 The opposition had a clear majority in Karnataka where the Congress and JDS fought separately, but after the result, both parties have joined hands
 congress ke 78, jedies ke 37 or basapa ke 1 vidhayak milakar ye aankada 116 pahunchataa he
 Apart from this, an independent MLA is also supported
 is tarah se vipaksh kii sankhya 117 pahunchati he
 They have 5 mlas more than the majority
 vipaksh aakhri vakt tak vidhayakon ko tuutane se bachaane main kaamyaab rahati he, to phir yediurppa kii vidaai tay he
 Keeping 14 mlas out of the congress-jds House, the BJP has 104 mlas
 is sankhya bal ke saath bijepi sarkaar bahumat tabhi paas kar sakati he, jab 221 vidhayakon kii sankhya sadan main 207 ho jaae
 14 mlas of Congress and JDS resign or remain out of the House during majority
 bijepi ke liye vipaksh ke 14 vidhayakon ko sadan se baahar rakhana yaa phir unhen istipha dilaanaa ek badi chunauti he
 If the congress-jds is successful in keeping its mlas together, then Yeddyurappa's chair is sure to go
 cross voting kii sthiti main dalbadal kanoon ke niyambijapi agar congress or jedies ke saat vidhayakon kii apane paksh main voting kara saki to yediurppa bahumat sabit kar sakate hai
 But under the rule of defection law, the membership of those legislators will be lost
 aisi sthiti main sarkaar kii sthirataa par sankat barkaraar rahegaa
 The way the Congress is taking every case to the Supreme Court, Yeddyurappa will be under a cloud of crisis
 uttarakhand, arunachal kaa udaahrunachal or uttarakhand maamle ko yaad rakhana chahie
 The Congress can knock the Karnataka case in the Supreme Court by taking the example of these two states
 in donon rajyon main arunachal main bijepi ne congress ko bedakhal karke sarkaar bana lee thi
 Whereas in Uttarakhand, the BJP broke the Congress mlas and imposed President's rule
 congress is maamle ko lekar hoicourt main gai, jahaan raashtrapati shashan ke faisle ko nirast kar diya gaya or congress phir se satta par kabiz ho gai thi
 If Yeddyurappa manages to save his government in this manner even in Karnataka, the Congress can again go to the Supreme Court

 rahul gandhi ne aaj subah hi kaha tha ki congress kii pradesh ikai aap ke saath gathbandhan nahin chaahati
 Rai said, i think either Rahul Gandhi is not understanding the situation of the country or is not able to explain the organization of his party

 He said, our workers do not want an alliance
 kai netaa vyaktigat rup se iske khilaaf hai

 dilli congress kii adhyaksh shila dikshit ne mangalvaar ko congress adhyaksh se mulaakaat ke baad ghoshnaa kii thi ki aap ke saath gathbandhan karne ke khilaaf ekamat ban gaya he
 After this announcement, AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal said that there are rumors that the Congress has a secret understanding with the BJP and his party is ready to compete with this 'unholy alliance'
 raay ne samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki yah alag maamla he ki dilli congress gathbandhan ke bare main kya kahati he lekin gandhi ko is sambandh main desh ke saamne centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar kii taanaashaahee jaisi chunautiyon par vichaar karte hue jimmedaari se faisla lenaa chahie

 One of the questions was whether Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's arrival in Noida proved inauspicious for the BJP
 haalanki ye ek andhvishwaas he, lekin raajnneetik partiyon se lekar aam jan tak isse achoote nahin hai
 Not only this, former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had said in a press conference that the impact of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath going to Noida will be seen

 The incident dates back to 2015-16, when a total of 34 tribal women accused the police and the Central Security Force of raping and gang-raping them

 BJP MP from Bhandara Gondia Lok Sabha seat of Maharashtra, Nanabhau Patole has resigned
 patole ne istipha dene ke saath pradhanmantri narendra modi kii kaaryastylee par bhi sawaal uthaaya he
 Let me tell you that this is not the first case, when Patole rebelled and submitted his resignation
 bhartiya raajnneeti main kareeb teen dashak bitaane vaale nanabhau patole kii chhavi ek baagi ke taur par hi ubhari he
 Continuing in the Congress - Patole, who had earlier stayed away from the Shiv Sena, joined the Congress, but won the Bhandara District Council elections in 1992 by winning an independent against the party candidate Madhukar Lichade
 haalanki jald hi ve phir se congress laut aae or iske baad 1995 vidhansabha chunaav main congress chhod di
 Nanabhau Patole from Lakhandur constituency stood against the party candidate Pramila, but the victory was won by bjp's Dayaram
 congress main vaapasi ke saath patole ne 1999 or 2004 ke vidhansabha chunaav main lakhdur jeet hasil kii
 In 2009, Patole resigned from the Congress on the issue of development of farmers and Vidarbha
 unhone nirdaleey ummidavaar ke taur par loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladaa or doosraa sthaan hasil kiya
 In this election, Praful Patel of NCP won, while BJP MP Shishupal Patale was third
 bijepi main jwoin kar jeeta chunaaviske baad patole ne bijepi jwoin kar lee or 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main sacoli seat se jeet hasil kii
 Patole was elected the deputy leader of the BJP in the assembly
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main patole ne ensipi ummidavaar prafull patel ko haraaya
 After three-and-a-half years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi began to trouble himself
 sitambar main patole ne nagpur main hue ek kaarykram main aarope lagaaya ki piem modi kisi kii bhi baat nahin sunate or party baithak main piem ne unhen us vakt apni baat nahin rakhane di thi, jab wo kisaanon kaa mudda uthaa rahe the
 For the past three months, Patole has been speaking out against the BJP government in Maharashtra
 piem modi or siem devendra fadanvis lagaataar unke nishane par rahe hai
 Patola also participated in the farmers' agitation organized by former finance minister and senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha in Akola
 'patole kaa koi sagaa nahin'ek varisht congress netaa kaa kahana he ki nanabhau patole kabhi kisi party ke vafaadaar nahin rahe
 The Congress leader said that the farmers' issue was just a show off, Patole wanted a ministerial post and he was forced to leave the party if ignored by the BJP
 swaagat ko taiyaar congreshmaharashtra main congress pramukh ashok chavaan ne kaha, 'ham patole kaa swaagat karte hai kyonki raajnneeti main hamen li se hatakar sochna hota he

 Let me tell you that recently the issue of the absence of Sachin and Rekha was raised in the Rajya Sabha under SP leader Naresh Aggarwal
 |mangalvaar ko naresh agarwal ne kaha tha ki jab sachin or rekha sadan main aate hi nahin hai, to kyon nahin unki sadsyta radd kar unhen sadan se nikaal diya jaae
 Let me tell you that the presence of Sachin and Rekha has been very less
 naresh agarwal ne kaha ki agar ham vijay maalya ko sadan se nikaal sakate hai to inhen kyon nahin
 Naresh Aggarwal has raised this issue before
 march main unhone sadan main kaha tha ki sanvaidhanik vyavastha ke tahat rajyasabha main 12 sadsy manonith kiye jate hai
 He said that people from different fields including cricket and film are nominated
 lekin aise kai sadsy sadan main nahin aa rahe hai
 He said that this could mean that he is not interested in it, and if he is not interested, he should resign
 kaaphi kam rahi upasthitisachin tendulkar or rekha donon hi 2012 main sadan main manonith hue the
 After which, in about 348 days, Sachin will remain in the House for only 23 days and Rekha for only 18 days
 ab haal hi main bhi monsoon satr main bhi donon upasthit nahin rahe hai

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni relinquished the limited overs captaincy yesterday and in such a situation, now Test captain Kohli can be tasked to lead the team in both these formats

 There is no doubt about Kohli being given the responsibility of captaincy, but it will not be easy for the selectors to choose the two teams keeping the right balance as many players are still battling injuries
 mumbai ke do ballebaaj rohit sharma or anjiky rahane chotil hone ke kaaran baahar hai
 This allows Shikhar Dhawan, who is in poor form, to be given the responsibility of opening the innings with KL Rahul in the event of a fit
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki chayankarta kisi bilkul nae khilaadi par bharosa dikhaaen
 Rahul of Karnataka did not play in the ODI series against New Zealand due to injury, while Delhi batsman Dhawan was also injured during the Test series against New Zealand
 baayen haath ke ballebaaj dhawan janvari main aakhri baar australia main vanade match khele the

 america sprinter justin gatelin or yusen bolt kii rassakashi se ham sab vaaqif hai
 This time Gatlin has won less than Usain Bolt in the 100 meter race
 lekin isamen pankhons kaa ahm role mana ja rahaa he
 High-power fans were installed to help Gatlin in this race, so his record would not be recognized
 100 meter kii res kaa record yusen bolt ke naam he

 58 second kaa record banaaya tha
 Gatlin did this stunt for a Japanese game show

 Gatlin has also been banned twice (in 2001 and 2006) for doping
 lekin unki koshishon se saafe he ki rio olympix ke dauraan 100 meter kii res ko lekar romaanch pehle se kahin zyaada hoga
 The 100-meter race record is named after Usain Bolt
 jamaica ke bolt ne 2009 main berlin world championships main 100 meter main 9
 a record of 58 seconds was made

 Gatlin completed the 100-meter race for a Japanese game show 'kasupe' with wings with the help of wings for 20 million Japanese yen, or about 11 lakh rupees
 res ke dauraan gatelin ke trek par apane peeche ek or khaas jagahon par chaar pankhe lagaae the
 With the help of wings, he was helped at a speed of 32 km / h, which is four times the limit
 gatelin par do baar doping kii vajah se (2001 or 2006 main) pratibandh bhi lag chukaa he

 The last batsman to miss a century by just one run, not out, was also Andrew Hall of South Africa, who came back for 99 against England at Leeds ground in 2003
 
 
 ham to sirf itnaa hi chahenge ki kaash, yah suchi aisi hi bani rahe, or ab isamen koi or naam na jude, lekin cricket hameshaa se anischitataaon kaa khel rahaa he, so, kuch kah bhi nahin sakate
 
 
 We only wish that this list remained the same, and no more names are added to it, but cricket has always been playing uncertainties, so we cannot say anything
