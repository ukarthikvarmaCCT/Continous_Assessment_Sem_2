 uttar pradesh ke kasganj main 26 janvari ke din hinsa ke peeche kii vajah kasganj ke dm arapy singh ne ajtak par silsilewar tareeke se bataai
 Kasganj DM RP Singh said in a special conversation with 'aaj Tak' that initial investigation has revealed that the bullet shot by Chandan Gupta was fired from the roof
 dm ke mutabik jis ghar kii chat se goli chali, wo muslim parivaar kaa he
 Apart from this, DM said many things about violence
 bike par tirangaa laga parikrama kar rahe the yuvadiem ne bataaya ki chandan gupta kii ek sankalp sanstha he
 Around 70-80 youths of the organization were circling the city shouting slogans in bikes
 vadunagar mohalle main jab ye gaye to vahaan pehle se jati vishesh ke log ikatthe the
 They were giving speech after the flag hoisting
 vahaan inamen aapas main vaad-vivaad hua
 However, there is no eyewitness to know what is causing the controversy

 baad main ye log taiyaar hokar 20-25 kii sankhya main badla lene kii bhaavana se ye kahkar nikle ki vahaan to unhone hamen aage jane se roak diya, dekhte hai ki yahaan kaise rokenge
 The bullet was fired from the roof of the Muslim house, on the other side of the house where people stopped them, from where the start of the brick and stone was told, being told that there was a bullet from the roof

 Chandan was declared dead at the hospital, while Naushad was admitted to Aligarh
 goli kisne chalaai, isaki abhi jaanch kii ja rahi he
 Later, as people came to know that it was a dispute between the two communities, an attempt was made to communalize it
 is bich ham logon ko paryaapt force mil gai thi, jisase or badi ghatana ghatane se batch gai
 What is the reason for the dispute? DM said that in this case one party said that when we reached there, we were raising slogans of Hindustan Zindabad
 to un logon ne bhi hamaare saamne hindustan jindabad kaa naaraa lagaaya
 After that he said that i have raised the slogan of Hindustan Zindabad, now you people should raise slogans of Pakistan Zindabad
 to inhone kaha ki ham hindustan ke hai
 We will not raise slogans of Pakistan Zindabad
 is baat kii kitni satyata he, ye abhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 An eyewitness has not been found yet
 jaanch main pataa chalegaa ki sach koun bol rahaa he
 Does the bullet reveal the angle of the shot that was shot to Chalchandan from only one community, that the bullet was fired from the top ie from the ceiling
 jo makaan vahaan par he wo muslim kaa he
 Prima facie it is found that the bullet was fired from that house
 kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa ki goli muslim dwaara chalaai gai hogi
 IO is investigating this
 magistrate jaanch hone tak kuch kahana thik nahimauke par maujuud logon kaa kahana he ki ye log jo yahaan aae the, unke haath main asalhe the, danda the, hockey thi
 It may have been firing from their side as well and Naushad was shot
 hamane magistrial jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 Until the investigation report comes out, it would be difficult to say if both were shot with the gun of one person or shot by different people, causing two people to be shot
 kisi tarah ke raajnneetik shadyantr kaa maamla saamne nahin aayaa he
 It is definitely seen that some youth set fire here and there in the spirit of revenge
 yah baaten prakaash main ai he or isi aadhaar par jaanch ko aage badhaayaa ja rahaa he
 If the name of any big figure comes up in this case then action will be taken against him
 juluus main muslim ladke bhi the jo inke dost the
 Therefore, it cannot be said that there was already a communal dispute about which such a big incident took place
 jis mohalle main yah bhidnt hui he vahaan kis baat par hathapayee or pathar chale or in logon ko bhaagna padaa jiske 1 ghante baad inako ghar se taiyaar hokar dobaaraa duusare mohalle main jahaan abhiyukt kaa ghar he us kshetra main janaa padaa
 It is understood from this that these people went with their companions again to avenge the stone-pelting in the last locality and this incident took place there
 agar prashasan or police ne vakt rahete maamle ko niyantrit naa kiya hota to ghatana or badi ho sakati thi
 The accused who was arrested in the case of firing on Chandan Gupta
 uskaa koi pehle kaa aapraadhik itihaas nahin tha
 When we searched his house, a pistol was found from his house and a domestic bomb was recovered

 do dashak yani kareeb bees saal biit gaye

 Where do we wake up until death shines? This is the story of the death of children in Muzaffarpur, Bihar
 kisi ko tej bukhaar tha
 Headache someone with fever
 kisi ko badan dard
 Someone has trouble breathing
 sab bachche the
 They were like children
 unhen to ye tak pataa nahin tha ki saansen jindagi ke liye jaruri hoti he
 And sometimes breath is also borrowed
 saanson kii utaar-chadhaav tak se anjaan the sab
 Leave the children, even the elders who came with them did not know that where they have brought their children in the hope of life, they themselves are living on borrowed breaths
 maut ke baad har sogvaar ghar se alag-alag kahaniyaan aa rahi hai
 But the pain is everyone's
 sawaal bhi sabakaa ek
 The question is, who is the culprit of the deaths of more than 135 children lying in the graves? Should such hospitals be closed which the government cannot provide necessary facilities at the time
 sajaa deni chahie un babu, afasaron or mantriyon ko jo aspataal ke hisse ke paise tab tak jeb se nahin nikaalte jab tak saanson kii ginati naa shuru ho jaae
 And answers should be sought from those governments who make promises and claims but are not able to provide the necessary treatment and medicines for the breath on time
 hairaani se zyada hairat ho rahi he in sab par
 Where are they jinke hukum se
 The spared breath of God is also groped in the scenes
 aake dekhen ki jis jagah ko zindagi bachaa lene ke liye banaaya gaya tha
 He is counting every martyr's martyrdom
 ye zamin ke bhagavaanon kaa koun sa rup he ki na jisamen dayaa he na dharm he
 Love is not here inaki jeene kii chaah kitnon ko be-maut maar daalati he
 These are the ones who are more interested in Rohit Sharma's hundreds than the hundreds of deaths of children
 tabhi to marate bacchon ko bachaane ke liye ho rahi meeting main bhi swasthya mantri kii nazar bharat-paak match ke score par thi
 Today, standing in the shadow of that hospital, it seems that now there is hardly any person who has even the slightest oxygen left
 kya kijiega hujur
 When the breath itself becomes murderer then how is it to cry? Still you cry
 kyonki aap khushnaseeb hai
 may Cry
 par un maasoom kilkareiyon kaa kya jinaki hichakiyaan tak ghut kar rah gayi or ukhdati saanson ne unhenrone tak kii mohalat nahin di
 They were all innocent
 jinhen gaye tak pataa nahin tha ki sarkaar or prashasan kii besharmi ke chalate aane vaali unki chamakdaar zindagi ko chamaki bukhaar kii nazar lag jaaegi
 From demonetisation to GST, Make in India to income tax returns are claimed to be filled with treasury
 magar khajaane se itane paise bhi nahin nikle ki bacchon kii tapati saansen kharid saken
 If the right treatment was received at the right time, the children would get their share of breath
 doctor, dawa, ilaaj muhaiyaa hota to kilkaariyaan phir se gunj uthatin
 But this did not happen
 jo mar chuke wo khushnaseeb lagate hai
 Those who are alive are busy trying to die
 sab kuch bazaar ban chukaa he
 The whole spectacle of life is only for money
 paisa hazam, khel khatam
 Because we do not get breath on credit here
 milti hai to sirf maut
 Then why should not that death be of killers
 to ab ro lijie jitna ronaa he
 Curse as much as each one wants to curse raajnneeti bhi kar lijie apane-apane hisaab se
 
 
 But do not take out the mournful sobs of those killers from your ears

 tamilnadu main gaay ke saath dushkarm kaa aropapulice ne 3 logon ko giraftaar kiya, jaanch shuru The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers are protesting at different places in Delhi or doing satyagraha in the language of the Aam Aadmi Party, due to the increase in the fare of Delhi Metro
 is satyagrah main AAP kaaryakarta jis bijepi netaa ke ghar ke baahar pradarshan karte he, unako gulab kaa phool dekar metro kaa kam karne kii apil karte hai
 But today, when AAP workers were protesting outside the house of BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi and trying to give her a rose, Meenakshi Lekhi gave her the entire bouquet instead of the rose
 iske saath hi bijepi kaaryakarta ko guladasta dekar dilli ke mukhyamantri aravind kejariwal ke ghar bheja or kaha ki AAP phool dekar satyagrah karti he or ham guladasta dekar
 Meanwhile, Meenakshi Lekhi also presented a sapling to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in view of the increasing pollution in Delhi and said that there is a need to plant trees to prevent pollution
 lihaaja main mukhyamantri ke liye ye paudha bhej rahi hum
 At the same time, the police had kept a four-level security system at Meenakshi Lekhi's house

 As soon as you reached outside the residence of activist Meenakshi Lekhi, the police immediately took her into custody

 At the same time, in the absence of Gopal Rai, AAP leader Somnath Bharti took the front today
 somnath bharti kaa kahana tha ki minakshi lekhi khud saansad he
 Do they not see the sorrow of Delhiites? Can't she appeal to the central government about this? BJP is responsible for the increase in Metro fares in Delhi
 agar bijepi chaahe to metro kaa kiraaya kam kiya ja saktaa he
 During this, AAP workers also raised slogans against PM Modi

 But the truth is that the fare has been increased only after a lot of meetings with the Delhi government

 During this time Meenakshi Lekhi also asked the question that Delhi government has DTC buses, so why the department is in such a loss? First fix it
 bijepi yaa centre sarkaar se to uskaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Then why is he in such a loss? Why don't people travel in buses? Delhi government should also answer all these questions

 kahaan raheen ve itane saal, kya kiya, kaise jiya
 Excerpts from her conversation: Calling an independent and self-sufficient life by-bye, the superstar of the 90s suddenly became a house-wife
 is nae role ke saath mail bithaana kitna aasaan tha or kitna mushkil?donon
 It was easy because i always wanted to get married and settle down because it was not easy to play the role of wife and mother
 jab main apane kariyar ke shikhar par thi to mujhe ghar kii koi parvaah nahin hoti thi
 i did not even know who cooks at home
 main kabhi kichan main ghusi hi nahin thi
 But after marriage, life remained confined around the house and kitchen
 pandrah saal aap kahaan gaayab raheen?apni betiyon ko paal rahi thi
 i do not know when the day was and the night

 ye ehsaas he ek maa kaa ki vah mujh par nirbhar hai or chaahe jo ho, mujhe unke liye khadey rahanaa he
 Is being a housewife better than being a career woman? i grew up in a conservative family
 mujhe to lagata he ki bina shaadi or bacchon ke ek stri kii jindagi sampurna nahin hoti
 Are there reports of your elder daughter Jahnavi coming to the movies? She wants to choose career instead of marriage
 ye sari baaten afvaah se zyada kuch nahin hai
 i want to focus all my attention on her studies right now
 boni bhi is maamle main bahut kanjarvative hai
 We both want our daughters to marry and settle down after completing their studies
 aap khud ek kariyar vuman hokar betiyon se aisi ummid kar rahi hai?main nijee soch or nirnay kaa sammaan karti hum
 If my daughters also finally take such a decision, then i have to support them, but as far as i want to be concerned, i want her to marry a good boy

 "how much do i agree with this dialogue in my personal life?" Is there any similarity between Shashi and Sridevi? No, Bonnie is very understanding and understanding, but the woman has to do the Sacrifice to run the family

 Husbands and children all depend on the woman for their small needs, which she has to stand on one leg round the clock to fulfill
 haalanki iskaa bhi apana sukh he
 Do you cook? Yes
 akasar bacchon kii pasand kaa khaanaa bananaa hi padataa he
 What causes the altercation between you and Bonnie? My craze for shopping
 vah meri shopping se bahut chidhate hai
 They support many times, but often call their aunt and cry their grief to them
 kehete hai, tumhen doctor ko dikhaane kii jarurat he
 Do you shop? Anything
 deras, shoej, cosmetics, ghar ke saamaan, bacchon kii chijen
 Interested in Politics? Not at all
 gas, petrol, dijal ke daam bad gaye hai
 You know? (smiling)
 mujhe is bare main kuch pataa nahin
 There is no interest in such things
 aap paaramparik hai, lekin ab bollywood ke bheetar or baahar aadhunik ladkiyaan shaadi or madrahud ko nakaar rahi hai?pataa nahin, main aisi ladakiyon ko nahin jaanati
 How important is love-sex in life? Life without love is not life at all

 Google, the world's largest Internet search engine company, is trying to make and sell cheap smartphones in India
 company ne iske liye ek program shuru kiya he, jise android van kaa naam diya gaya he
 Under this, it will also supply reference hardware, so that mobile manufacturer companies can make cheap handsets at the cheapest
 google chaahati he ki bharat main smartphone 100 dollar yani 6,000 rupee kii range main ban jaae
 The market for such a cheap smartphone is huge
 carbon, micromax, spice vagairah ne aise handset banane shuru bhi kar die hai
 Micromax and Karbonn alone make up 25 percent of India's total mobile phone production
 google ne micromax ke pehle android van handset pradarshit kiya tha
 That 4
 5 inch kaa handset he or usamen dual sim function he
 Apart from this, it also has FM radio
 google ke android van project ke peeche uddeshy yah he ki log bade paimaane par feechar phone se uthakar smartphone kii ore jaaen
 This will increase traffic and advertising in Google
 iske liye google chaahati he ki smartphone ke daam kam hon or log unhen zyada se zyada khariden
 This week it was also discussed that Google will give 100 crore to smartphone makers in India and will spend the same amount on smartphone advertisements

 saal 2000 main film 'kaho na pyaar he' se apana bollywood debyue karne vaale actor ruthik roshan kii fain folowing desh-videsh main he
 Hrithik Roshan does less films
 ek gap ke baad hi unki filmein aati hai
 Now Hrithik Roshan's film Super 30 has been released after Kaabil
 ise lekar shuruaati report badhiya he
 Hrithik Roshan is such a Bollywood star who is also called India's first superhero because of Krish
 jindagi naa milegi dobaaraa jaisi film se actor ne darshakon ko travel or friendship gols die to vahiin kabhi khushi kabhi gam main ham sabhi kaa dil jeeta
 Hrithik Roshan's films have been very special for cinema lovers
 ve har baar ek nai or alag kahani ke saath ham sabhi ko kuch nayaa karke dikhaate hai or apni chhap phens ke dilon par chhod jate hai
 But if we look at Hrithik Roshan's films, then there is a different pattern in them
 ruthik kii zyaadaatar filmein mail dominent hoti hai, jinamein aapako hero, uskaa ection, villen ke saath uski takaraar hi zyada dekhne ko milti he
 Heroine's role in most of Hrithik's films is nothing special
 ham sabhi ne krish, baing baing, dhooma 2, agnipath or kaabil jaisi kai tamaam filmein dekhi hai, jahaan ruthik roshan, ection karte najar aae hai
 But his heroine has got nothing more than romance with him

 # super30 # july12tha post shared byhrithik Roshan(@hrithikroshan) onjul 11, 2019 at 4:24am pdtaba jab ruthik roshan kii nai film super 30 relies hui he to ummid kii ja rahi thi ki is film main heroin kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi mrinal thakur ke role main shaayad kuch khaas hoga
 but that did not happen
 jahaan film super 30 kii imotional story or ruthik roshan kii badhiya parformens ke charche har jagah ho rahe hai
 Hrithik's film also has heroine show pieces
 saal 1960 main prakhyat film nirmaataa bimal roy ne 'parakh' banaai thi
 This film written by Salil Chaudhary is a satire on the Indian politics of Nehru era
 is film kii kahani ek postmaster ke idgird he jise 5 lakh rupee kaa check miltaa he
 He has to give this check to some of the most suitable person in the village who can provide welfare to the people
 postmaster (nasir hossain) iske liye chunaav karne kaa nirnay letaa he
 This election is actually a classic case study of how far people fall in politics
 iske 58 saal ke baad bhi aaj dekhen to bhartiya raajnneeti main bahut zyada badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Bimal Roy's film is equally relevant today
 gaanvon ke halaat main zyada badlaav nahinyah saal 2018 he
 We have reached a new century and today people use post offices very rarely, but there is still very little change in the situation in villages where problems like poverty, caste division and lack of basic facilities remain
 sabhi tarah ke raajnneetijna ab bhi nirdosh graminon main dharmik bhaawanaaon ko hawa dekar satta kii ladaai main unhen apana pyaadaa banaae rakh sakate hai
 Over the past several decades, campaigning campaigns filled with zeal and verbal attacks have divided the state and society
 aaj kii chunavi raajnneeti main waar or prati-waar din-ba-din shaatir kism ke hote ja rahe hai
 We rarely see politicians debating issues related to development
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav bhi isse kuch alag nahin he
 The war between the top leaders like Socialist Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress President Rahul Gandhi will be back on track is not limited to political issues
 piem modi or rahul gandhi, donon ne karnataka chunaav main apane number badhaane ke liye ek-duusare par nijee hamalon se parhez nahin kiya he
 Our leaders seem to have forgotten that when the elections are over, the society will again come on a cordial path in the same way
 zyaadaatar logon ko kuch nahin milane vaala15 may ko jab karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon kii ghoshnaa hogi, saaf ho jayega ki karnataka kaa taj kiske sir par sajega
 But as in most elections in the country, a large part is not going to get anything from this election
 jis party ko 40 fisadi ke aasapaas vot mil jaaenge, vah vijeta ho saktaa he, lekin baaki hisse ke log parajeet mahasoos karenge
 The leaders who rise above politics, not to worry, is not a matter of how hot the election campaigns have come but it is now that there is a famine of such leaders who are coming from the politics during the election campaigns in the society To remove division
 yah sirf karnataka kii hi nahin balki puure desh kii chintaa he
 Now they are called leaders who can rise above politics and work for the good of society
 har chunaav hamaare samaaj ko or vibhajit kar detaa he
 Passion is extreme, especially in social media, people block or unfriend each other because of political differences, further deepening the divide
 purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa yah kathan sabase prakhyat rahaa he-'raajnneeti main matbhed rakhie, manabhed nahin
 'we often cover up differences
 ab samay aa gaya he ki ek desh ke rup main ham uthen or samaaj ke taane-bane ko navsrujit karne ke liye smart ravaiya apanaaen or us bharose ko phir se kaayam karen, jise ki aaj raajnneetik soch main giravat kii vajah se nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Politicians cannot be held responsible for the polarization in the society today
 aksar media bhi pratikatmak takaraavon ko zyada tavajjo detii he, bajaay logon ke dainik jivan par asar daalane vaale masalon par dhyaan dene ke
 Are we ready to work together? This raises a question
 kya ham chunaav khatm hone ke baad miljulkar kaam karne ke liye taiyaar hai, jisase shiksha, bijli kii pahunch, swasthya, vikaas pariyojnaon, paryaavaran chintaaon, bujurgon kii upeksha, sharaab kii buree lat, prakritik sansadhano kaa atishay dohan, kisaanon kii aatmahatya, bhukh or awaas jaise masalon ko hal kiya ja sake? kya sarkaar ke gathan ke baad piem modi or rahul gandhi rajya kii samasyaon ke samaadhan ke liye ek saath aaenge?bimal roy kii parakh main gaanv kaa postmaster vittiya mushkilon main funs jaataa he-sir par karj, atyant biimaar patni or ek beti jisaki vah kisi aise vyakti se shaadi karnaa chahta he jo use pyaar or sammaan de
 All this has to do with limited social help and resources
 dukhad yah he ki nehru se modi tak lekarbhartiya gaanvonki dasha main bahut zyada badlaav nahin aayaa he
 The sluggish pace of India's progress over the last seven decades is often considered to be the biggest shortcoming of the democratic system of government
 lekin duniya ke kai deshon main jo adhinayakawadi shashan kaa vikalp he use loktantr kaa behatar vikalp nahin mana ja saktaa
 Former UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill said, "the biggest argument against a democracy is to have a five-minute conversation with a common voter
" ' bhartiya raajnneeti or samaaj ko aise netaaon kii jarurat he, jo vividhta ko vibhaajan main baantne ke pralobhan kaa pratikaar karen or apane nihit matbhedon ke baavjood samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ko ekikrut karen

 This is the period when the mother has to go through a lot of stress and pain
 garbhavastha ke dauraan aise kai lakshan hai, jo viksit ho rahe shishu ke mastishk ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai or aage chal kar mastishk pakshaaghaat yani cerebral palsy kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 Dr
 chundavat ke mutabik, thyroid vikaar, sijar, chikanpox, rubella, cytomegalovyrus jaise sankraman yaa virus, multiple berth, banjhapan ke upachaar ke liye assistive riprodective technology jaise kuch pramukh kaaran hai jo bacchon main cerebral palsy kaa kaaran banate hai
 According to the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, about 33,000 people in our country are living with cerebral palsy
 haalanki duniya bhar main yah aankada har 500 jivit janm main se ek kaa he
 To understand cerebral palsy, it is very important to understand what type it is
 iskaa pehla prakaar spastic cerebral palsy kaa he
 About 70-80 per cent of all cases are affected by this
 cerebral palsy mansapeshiyon ke samoohon ko prabhavit karata he or vikaar paidaa kar saktaa he
 Spastic cerebral conditions can cause brain damage, which occurs before birth or during birth or in the early years of a child's life
 bachche ke ek saal kaa hote-hote isaki pahchaan spasht ho jaati he, kyonki lakshan saaf taur par dikhne lagate hai
 The second type is dyskinetic cerebral palsy
 isamen main mastishk ke us hisse ko nuksaan pahunchataa he, jise basal gangliya kaha jaataa he
 It is believed to be responsible for regulating voluntary activities
 mastishk ke anya kshetron ke saath basal gangliya ke conection ke chalate yah bhavnaae manodasha or vyavhaar par bhi niyantran karata he
 The third type of this is mixed cerebral palsy
 kai cerebral palsy rogiyon main kisi ek tarah kii cerebral palsy ke lakshan nahin hote hai
 These patients are thought to suffer from mixed cerebral palsy
 unamem saamaanya se lekar spastic, etetoid or atexic cerebral palsy ke mishrit lakshan dikhte hai
 Mixed cerebral palsy is actually a type of cerebral palsy characterized by three other cerebral palsies
 cerebral palsy vaale sabhi rogiyon main lagbhag das fisadi rogi aise hote hai
 This type has a combination of at least two forms of cerebral palsy
 mixd cerebral palsy mastishk ko pahunche nuksaan ke kaaran hoti he
 This is followed by ataxic cerebral palsy
 isse peedit bachche kii gatividhi main akadan yaa asthirataa hoti he
 Can not sit or walk properly and feel jerky
 garbhavastha ke dauraan cerebral palsy ke liye kai kaaran ho sakate hai
 These include pregnancy injury, hormonal changes, infection during pregnancy, blood related diseases, infertility treatment, low birth weight, brain injury, premature birth, brain damage, complications in birth
 dow chundavat ne kaha, " garbhavastha ke dauraan in saavdhaaniyon par dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie kyonki cerebral palsy ek vikasaatmak vikaar he
 Usually, it can not be detected when women are pregnant
 haalanki doctor shishu ke vikaas par najar rakhte hue yah pataa laga sakate hai ki kahin bachche ke vikaas main deree to nahin ho rahi he
 "what precautions should be taken by the mother during pregnancy
 ise lekar chundavat kehete hai ki isse bachane ke liye haath saaf rakhana, prasav purv niyamit dekhbhaal karnaa, doctor se niyamit chekup karwaanaa, khud ko flu se bachaana, doctor ke saath blad campatebilti par charchaa karnaa, rubella se khud ko bachaana, jeevanstyli ko niyantrit karnaa, samay par tikaakaran karwaanaa, multiple berth ke jokhimon ke bare main jaagruk rahanaa shaamil hai
 Remember that cerebral palsy is not the end of life
 is beemaari ke shikaar log bhi utana hi jite hai jitna koi saamaanya shaks
 However, cerebral palsy affects not only the person who suffers from it but also the caring family
 cerebral palsy se nipatane ke liye rogi or parivaar ko dher sari counselling, physical therapy, shaikshik sahaayta, ghar main badlaav or peshewar chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 In such a situation, the role of awareness is most important for this disease because there is no definitive treatment for it

 Vasudev Devnani, who became professor of education from Rajasthan, has come up with a new proposal to pacify them, troubled by the opposition of Brahmins
 rajasthan ke schuli shiksha main ab brahman devtaa parashuram kaa parakram padhaayaa jayega
 Talking to the representatives of Vipra Foundation, Education Minister Vasudev Devnani said that he will add courses on Parashuram along with other great men in Rajasthan schools
 saath hin skulon kii librari or duusare rajkeey librariyon main bhi parashuram kii jeevani padhai jaaegi
 The agitation for the removal of Devnani has been demanded by the Brahmins to run the agitation till the education minister is recommended at different conferences of Parashuram Jayanti
 brahman mahasabha kaa kahana he ki paathyakram kaa nirdhaaran paathyakram samiti karti he na ki shiksha mantri
 Therefore, the Education Minister should not give false assurance
 pushkar main hue aaj brahman mahasabha or sadhu santon ke sammelan main vasudev devnani ko hataane ke liye andolan chalaane kaa faisla liya gaya
 Former MLA Raghu Sharma said that Devnani, who used to put a professor in front of his name without becoming a professor, is now putting Shri in front of his name, but why he kept writing a false professor for so many days
 darjanon udghaatan or shilanyashon ke shilalekhon main shiksha mantri ke naam ke aage professor likhaa ja chukaa he
 The Chief Minister should be sacked of such education minister
 kya he vivadadrasal jab shiksha mantri ke professor nahi hote hue bhi naam ke aage professor lagane kaa maamla rajasthan hoicourt gaya tha
 The Education Minister there replied that Brahmins do not know anything, yet why do they put pundits in front of the name
 shiksha mantri ke is bayaan par bavaal machaa hua he or sabhi brahman sanghathan shiksha mantri se istife or maafee kii maang kar rahe hai
 The education minister clarified several times that his motive was not to insult the Brahmins
 lekin maamla shant hota nahi dikh rahaa he

 He said that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had started the plan to clean the Ganges and Yamuna and if it had not been done then the plight of these rivers would have been even more terrible

 paanch rajyon ke chunaav parinaam dekhte hue bhaajapa or congress ke alaava aam aadmi party (aap) ke liye nigam chunaav pratishtha kaa sawaal hai
 If the BJP is again with the help of Modi wave, then the Congress, which is continuously losing from the Lok Sabha elections, is looking into the foothold
 idhar pradesh main jabardast bahumat ke saath satta par kabiz aap ko yah sabit karnaa he ki pichley do saal main usne dilliwaalon kaa dil kitna jeeta he
 The BJP has been in control of the municipal corporation for a decade
 lekin is dauraan dilli kii phija aabaadi ke lihaaj se badali he
 According to a study, if the Ring Road was to be considered a measure, before the 2003 delimitation, 50 of Delhi's 70 assembly seats were in and 20 out
 isi tarah se loksabhaa kii paanch siten andar or do baahar
 But after the delimitation, 20 seats of Assembly and two seats of Lok Sabha were left inside the ring road
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne jab aam aadmi party kaa gathan kiya to is badale hue sameekaran kaa achche se adhyayan kiya or purvaanchali voton, auto waalon ke saath-saath slam aria par focus kiya
 The formula worked and you got power
 modi banaam kejarivalkendre main modi sarkaar ke teen saal ke shashan kii pro-inakambency ke falswaroop uttar pradesh main aitihaasik jeet se bhaajapa ke hausale buland hai, jabaki punjab or goa main munh kii khaane ke baad aap ke tevar deele hai
 However, this is the first time after the Delhi Assembly elections that the battle for the corporation election will be seen as Modi vs Kejriwal
 kejariwal hameshaa se sarkaar chalaane main dikkaton ke liye modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate rahe hai
 Even though this election is local, the competition looks like assembly-lok Sabha elections
 chunaav prabandhan kii bhi parikshanigam chunaav bhaajapa or aap kii ranneeti kaa imtihaan bhi he
 The BJP has worked on the Gujarat formula to deny tickets to all 153 councilors and their relatives in Delhi
 party ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh or nigam chunaav prabandhan se jude vinay sahasrabuddhe kehete hai, ''sarkaar se baahar aakar sanghathan main kaam karne kii bhaajapa kii puraani parampara he
 "while Delhi BJP in-charge Shyam Jaju says," This decision is only for this election
 party nivartmaan parshadon ko bhavishya main yogyata ke hisaab se samyojit karegi
 "that is why the party has raised the slogan" New face, new energy, new flight, Delhi Mangal Kamal Nishan "
 bhaajapa ne sabhi 13,372 boothon par cametiyaan gathit kii hai
 At the end of March, the party convened five workers from each booth to conduct the Panch Parmeshwar Sammelan
 isamen bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne nigam chunaav kaa bigul foonka tha
 The party has run a door-to-door campaign
 saansadon, vidhayakon, purv vidhayakon, pratyaashiyon or parshadon kii alag team chunaav abhiyaan ke liye ward ke hisaab se taiyaar kii gai he jisamen sthaneey saansadon ko tarjeeh di ja rahi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has also set up a team of 10 people, strengthening its booth structure in Delhi
 aap ne tristareey ranneeti banaai he
 Apart from the strategy of door-to-door, she is conducting a continuous survey with a 15-question questionnaire, which has questions related to the functioning of the municipal corporation and what the BJP did
 janata ko nigam ke kaamon kii zyada jaankaree nahin he, so aap logon ko bataa rahi he ki nigam ko kya-kya karnaa chahie tha jo usne 10 saal main nahin kiya
 The party is showing a show with Kejriwal's speech on the streets and intersections consisting of 6-7 wards, in which the corporation's failures are being counted
 kejariwal khud alag team ke saath prabandhan dekh rahe hai
 At the assembly level, MLA and state convenor Dilip Pandey took charge from the organization
 buraadi se aap vidhayak sanjeev kumaar jha kehete hai, ''ham aashwast hai ki 2015 main kejariwal kii 49 din kii sarkaar ke liye jo craij tha, vahi sthiti do saal ke sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko dekhte hue janata main he
 The same wave will also be seen in the corporation elections
 "haalanki congress mukaable main nahin he lekin punjab main bahumat milane or goa-manipur main badi party banane se use dilli main sthiti sudharne kii gunjaaish dikh rahi he
 It is also time for State Congress President Ajay Maken to prove himself
 unhone pehle ''chaat" par charchaa kaarykram kii shuruyaat kii to ab ve ''dilli kii baat dil ke sathy kaarykram ke jariye bhaajapa or aap donon par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 At the same time, due to the results of Punjab, BJP is considering both AAP and Congress as a serious challenge
 muddon par baari aarope-pratyaropabhaajapa aap sarkaar ke khilaaf chaar aarope-patr nikaalane ja rahi he—bhrashtachar, vaadakhilaphi, aparaadh or adangebaaji
 While the BJP has prepared to surround Kejriwal on these issues, the AAP has also made a strategy to put the BJP in the dock on issues like dengue, cleanliness
 sahasrabuddhe kaa aarope he ki bhaajapa shasit teenon nigamon ne elidi, sadak jaise vishyon par achche kaam kiye, lekin dilli sarkaar kii akarmanyata or vaadakhilaphi kii vajah se swatchta par zyada behatar kaam nahin ho paaya
 On this, AAP MLA Sanjeev Jha says, "the biggest promise of the Kejriwal government was electricity and water, which we showed by doing it
 aaj 90 lakh pariwaron kaa bijli bill aadha ho chukaa he to 65 lakh pariwaron kaa pani bill shunya aa rahaa he
 "the AAP has now given the populist slogan of house tax waiver in the corporation on the lines of electricity and water and making Delhi in London and it is also putting the figure of treatment of 40 lakh people in the Mohalla clinics
 udhar, maakan kaa aarope he ki shiksha-swasthya ke kshetra main bhaajapa shasit nigam naakaara sabit hue
 If AAP gets a shock in this election, rebellion against Kejriwal's leadership can be elevated
 bhaajapa to jaahir he, puri tarah se modi lahar ke bharose he
 The rebellion in the AAP and Congress is increasing
 aap vidhayak veda marwaah or congress ke varisht netaa or purv dipti spikar ambarish gautam bhaajapa main aa gaye hai, jabaki e
 K
 walia naaraaz hai
 In such a situation, if the BJP wins the corporation for the third time, then the status of state president Manoj Tiwari will increase

 Now Mamta Banerjee has also reacted to this letter
 mamata banerjee ne kaha, har kisi ko pataa ki desh main kya chal rahaa he
 i respect all intellectuals, i think everything they wrote is a genuine complaint of the people
 mamata banerjee ne kaha, mujhe lagata he ki pradhanmantri modi ko is bare main suchit karne kaa yah sahi samay he
 Any citizen can write a letter to the PM for any purpose
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki agar bijepi ise raajnneeti se prerit kahati he to yah shame kii baat he

 These include names of giants like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Ramchandra Guha, Anurag Kashyap

 What is written in the letter? All the celebrities have demanded from PM Modi that they should enact strict laws to prevent incidents of mob lynching and severe punishment should be given to the accused
 ahasamati ko kuchlaa naa jaae
 It is written in the letter, our constitution describes India as a secular republic, where people of every religion, group, gender, caste have equal rights

 It is also written that just criticizing PM Modi for such incidents will not work

 In such a situation, political relations between the NCP and the Congress, the ally of the UPA, are ending the Rajya Sabha elections
 darasal, gujarat congress ne is bich kaha he ki is chunaav main congress apane upie ke saathi dal ensipi ke saath gathbandhan nahi karegaa
 This decision has been taken by Gujarat Congress after the vote of Ahmed Patel in Rajya Sabha elections

 itnaa hi nahingujarat congresske adhyaksh bharatsingh solanki kaa kahana hai ki gujarat ke bheetar lambe vakt se ensipi bijepi kii bi team ke taur par kaam kar rahi he
 At the same time, NCP is denying that both NCP mlas voted for BJP

 At the same time, the second MLA voted for Ahmed Patel
 is puure prakaran ke baad prafull patel kah rahe hai ki gathbandhan ke rahane yaa na rahane kaa faisla aane vaale samay par liya jayega
 At the same time NCP is preparing itself to contest more and more seats
 sattavirohi lahar se congress ko ummidgujrat main mukhya vipakshi party congress ko ummid he ki use beete 20 saalon kesattavirohi laharka phayda milegaa
 However, NCP is also trying to field its candidates in such seats where they too can take advantage of the anti-incumbency wave
 aisi sthiti main agar congress or ensipi ke saath na rahane kaa sabase adhik phayda bijepi ko hi milegaa

 View this post on instagramprecious pic 🥰 !! The first time in my life that i asked to be introduced to someone
 
 
 Thank you @smritiiraniofficial for the same 🙂
 i loove @hillaryclinton ♥ ️
 a woman who has weathered every storm with equanimity and who never gives up
 
 
 i felt hopeful while she campaigned to be # President and felt a certain hopelessness when she didn't make it
 
 
 But in a few days i realized that only when the glass ceiling is shattered can we reach the sky and she broke it for us
 
 
 and thus paved the way for someone else to reach for the boundless blue
 You may find many reasons to dislike her but that’s because you are judging her because she dared to travel where most don’t
 
 
 Thank you @hillaryclinton for all that you are and for being a HERO ☀️ !! And thank you my # siddharthroykapur for being a walking talking encyclopedia on American politics and for thereby introducing me to Her 🙂
 i couldn’t have imagined waking up at 6am to watch the primaries until you happened to me 😜

 This development includes repeated gestures from Nitish to RJD
 somvaar yani ki 3 june ko argedy ke senior netaa raghuvansh prasad singh aage aae or nitish ko mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone kaa nyauta diya
 Former Union Minister and RJD Vice President Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said that the situation in Bihar has now become such that everyone will have to unite and Nitish should also return to our grand alliance
 argedy ke udaar chehron main shaamil raghuvansh prasad ne kaha ki agar bijepi ko hataanaa he to sabhi gaiyr bhaajapa dal saath aaen, unhone kaha ki sabhi kaa matlab nishchit rup se nitish bhi hai
 Journalists reminded Hath Raghuvansh Prasad of Tejashwi Yadav, where Tejashwi often said that all the avenues of the grand alliance are closed for Nitish Kumar
 iske jawaab main unhone kaha ki raajnneeti main koi dost yaa dushman nahin hota he
 Raghuvansh Prasad said that what did Tejaswi give by writing on stamp paper that Nitish Kumar cannot come? Raghuvansh is considered the liberal face of RJD
 aisa bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki party ne jaanboojhkar unhen aage kiya he
 So that Nitish can be brought back
 jediu ke netaa or nitish kumaar raghuvansh prasad ke is ofer par charchaa hi kar rahe the ki kuch ghante-bitate-bitate bihar kii purv mukhyamantri or lalu yadav kii patni rabari devi kaa ek bada bayaan aayaa
 Rabri made a clear offer to Nitish Kumar and said that if he comes in the grand alliance, then he will not have any problem

 He praised Nitish and said that God has given Nitish Kumar another chance to become a secular face
 ek mauka pehle mahagathbandhan main mila tha jise unhone endie main phir jaakar ganvaa diya
 While Nitish Kumar is getting repeated calls from RJD, his distance from BJP is increasing

 The Lions have shown a tremendous game
 The Suresh Raina-led Lions team performed impressively in their debut season in the IPL and topped the league stage
 haalanki pehle kwalifire main abi divilliars kii behtareen ballebaaji se royal chalangers bangalore ne loyns ko haraa diya tha
 The task for Lions is still not easy as she will now face a team from which she lost both matches in the league stage
 sunrisers ko haraana hoga mushkildonon avasaron par sunrisers ke khilaaf loyns apane score kaa bachaav karne main naakaam rahe the
 Sunrisers have had a slight edge in bowling as Ashish Nehra left for England for a knee operation but Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Bangladesh Mustafizur Rahman have bowled very well
 in donon ne buudhvaar ko hue alimineter main sunrisers ko kolkata niterides par 22 ranon kii jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Kotla's pitch will be slow
 In this match, captain David Warner used Bhuvneshwar and Mustafizur as their trumpets and they also put pressure on KKR batsmen well
 firozshah kotla ke wicket se tej gendbaajon ko kuch madad mil rahi he lekin toornament aage badhane ke saath yah thodaa dhimaa pad gaya he
 The way Lions fast bowler Dhawal Kulkarni bowled against Royal Challengers Bangalore in the first qualifier suggests that the batsmen will again have to go through a difficult period here
 krij par dena hoga samaygendbaajon par krij par utarate hi haaavee hone kii ranneeti yahaan nahin chal paaegi or ballebaajon ko apane haath kholane se pehle krij par kuch samay bitaana hoga
 This is what Yuvraj Singh did against KKR and eventually his innings made a difference in the result of the match
 loyns ke paas achche ballebaaj hai jo sunrisers ke gendbaajon ko kadi chunauti de sakate hai
 She hopes Brandon mccullum will do well on Friday
 maikulam or smith par jimmaakiwi ballebaaj ko shuru main hi team ko acchhee shuruuaat deni hogi
 At the other end, Dwayne Smith is still in good form and the Sunrisers bowlers will try to send him to the pavilion soon
 smith kii paariyaan abhi tak loyns ke liye mahatvapurn sabit hui he or wo chahenge ki westeindies kaa yah olerounder apana shandaar pradarshan jari rakhe
 Aaron Finch is another batsman who can change the map of the entire match on his own
 yuvi, warner or dhawan dikhaaenge damajahan tak sunrisers kii baat he to yuvaraj apni puraani lay main laut aae hai jo ki nishchit taur par unke liye acchhee khabar he
 Shikhar Dhawan is also among the top five batsmen who are in good form but their batting is heavily dependent on Warner and the left-handed batsman will again have to give the team a better start
 ipel ko milegaa nayaa championlekin yah nishchit taur par sunrisers ke tej gendbaajon or loyns ke ballebaajon ke bich jang hogi
 There is another funny thing in this qualifier, no matter who is the team that reached the final this time, the IPL is sure to get a new champion this time because any team that had won before it is no longer in the title race

 soshal media aisa plateform he jahaan kabhi bhi kuch bhi viral ho jaataa he
 Many types of talent are also exposed through social media
 aisa hi ek video in dinon soshal media par dhooma machaa rahaa he

 Not only Shankar Mahadevan but there were many such stars who became crazy about Rakesh
 kehete hai ki guru kaa darja bhagwaan se bhi upar hota he
 That is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi became restless after hearing the health condition of his mentor and made a program to meet the Guru in a hurry
 pradhanmantri shuukravaar ko apane aadhyatmik guru swami dayanand giri saraswati se bhent karne rishikesh ja rahe hai
 Let us tell you why Dayanand Giri is so special for Prime Minister Modi
 16 saal purana rishtaswami dayanand saraswati aurapradhanmantri narendra modika rishta bahut purana he
 Even sixteen years ago Narendra Modi came to Dayanand Ashram in Rishikesh
 jab jab bhi modi ke saamne koi mushkil samasya ai, tab-tab unhone guru se gyaan liya
 He was welcomed by calling Gandhinagar, when Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he welcomed him with great respect by calling his Gurudyanand Girico Gandhinagar
 modi ke jivan par gaharaa prabhaav86 saal swami dayanand saraswati kii sabase badi khubi ye he ki wo vedant ke jariye aaj kii samasyaon kaa bhi nidaan nikaal lete hai
 Due to this, on the one hand they keep hold of the traditions, while on the other hand, modernity also gives a boost to their ideas

 (also from the input language) (inputs bhashaa se bhi) a petition has been filed in the High Court to reduce the age of drinking in Delhi
 hoicourtne dilli sarkaar or aabkaari vibhaag ko notice karke jawaab maanga he
 This petition states that the maximum drinking age in Delhi is 25 years
 ise hataaya janaa chahie
 The petition has said that when the age of voting is 18 years, then how can we stop drinking alcohol when i become an adult? upi, goa, telugana or jharkhand main sharaab pine kii kanoonee umr 21 saal he, jabaki rajasthan or puducheri main ise 18 saal tay kiya hua he
 But a public interest litigation has been filed in the High Court challenging the minimum age of 25 years of shopping and drinking in Delhi, questioning why it is 25 years in Delhi
 maamle main agali sunwaayee ab 9 oktober ko hogi
 The petition has argued that the legal drinking age in UP, Goa, Telangana and Jharkhand is 21 years, while in Rajasthan and Puducherry it is fixed at 18 years
 aise main rajasthan or puducheri kaa koi vyakti jiske rajya main sharaab pine kii vaidhanik umr 18 he, yadi dilli main aakar sharaab peetaa he to yahaan ye krime he
 Similarly, the youth of Delhi go to other states where the legal drinking age is low, the question remains how they will behave there
 yachika main ek report ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki 18 se 25 kii umr vaale yuvaaon kii 67 fisadi aabaadi ne sharaab kharidi or kisi ne bhi unase unka umr kaa pramaan nahin maanga
 The petition has also demanded that the Delhi government should be directed to make students aware of the responsibility related to drinking alcohol by making awareness campaigns of schools and colleges a part of the curriculum
 yachika main maang kii gai he ki dilli exise act, 2009 kii dhara 23 ko radd kiya jaae
 Because according to this section, the minimum legal age for drinking alcohol in Delhi is 25

 Trouble after the court's order of green firecrackers, about 1070 licensed firecrackers are in the country's largest fireworks production center 'sivakasi'
 kai bina license bhi ye kaam karte hai
 Each cracker manufacturer employs at least 300 employees on contract
 yahaan sara kaam haathon se hi hota he
 After Diwali in 2018, the work of making firecrackers was completely stopped
 court ke green pataakhon sambandhi aadesh aane tak yahi sthiti rahi
 The firecracker industry suffered a loss of Rs 800 crore due to four months of shutdown
 saath hi kareeb 10 lakh karmchaariyon kii jeevika par bhi sankat aa gaya
 "the entire industry remained closed for four months after the Diwali of 2018," said fireworks worker Arumugam

 But all the units are making them and claiming that they are following all the standards of green firecrackers

 Some manufacturers say that green firecrackers have a very short shelf life
 pichley saal bhram or factriyon ke band hone kii sthiti main retail market par bhi asar padaa
 Krishna Kumar, a retailer of firecrackers in Sivakasi, says, "due to the shutdown of four months, production was low, due to which we are not in a position to meet demand
" ab log pataakhe kharidne aa rahe hai
 Fireworks are being sent all over the country
 bikri acchhee he lekin sach ye he ki ham demand puri nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Azaga Muthu Kumar, who runs a wholesale and retail store of firecrackers, has more than 420 varieties of firecrackers available
 kumaar ke mutabik pichley saal yaa usase pehle kii tulana main ye bahut kam variety hai
 Kumar says, "there is good demand in the market but prices are also slightly higher
 aisa lebar kii dikkat or utpaadan main kami kii vajah se he

 mukhya rup se in ritred javaanon kii sarkaar se maang he ki puraani pension yojana lagu ho

 oropi yojana sevanivrutt hue sainikon ke liye he
 Under this, it was said that equal pension should be given to soldiers of the same rank who retired after completing the same tenure at different times
 is yojana ko saal 2016 main lagu kiya gaya lekin yah 2014 se prabhavi he
 That is, this pension scheme is in force since 2014
 is yojana kaa phayda kareeb 30 lakh sainikon kii vidhwaaon or purv sainikon ko miltaa he
 However, under this scheme, the pension is re-fixed every five years in future
 vahiin jo sainik swechha se ritairement (viares) lete hai unhen oropi nahin milti he
 This would not include soldiers retiring due to injuries in war
 oropi par kitna padaa bojraksha mantralay kii ore se 2015 main ek notification jari kiya gaya
 It was told in this notification that the previous government had announced a provision of Rs 500 crore in the budget to implement One Rank One Pension
 vartmaan sarkaar ne is kaary ko praathamikta ke aadhaar par liya tathaa yah paaya ki iske liye vaarshik atirikt vyay vartmaan main 8 se 10 hajaar karod rupee hoga jo bhavishya main or badhegaa
 While presenting the interim budget on February 1, Finance Minister Piyush Goyal said in his speech that under the One Rank, One Pension, the government has so far given Rs 35 thousand crore to the retired soldiers
 ab ardhsainik balon kii baari!desh main ardhsainik balon kii puraani pension yojana kii maang ab tej ho rahi he
 Retired paramilitary forces are coming to Delhi's Jantar Mantar to put pressure on the government
 vahiin congress samet vipakshi partiyon kii ore se ardhsainik balon kii maang ko samarthan milane laga he
 This is to say that it can become an important issue before the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main yah dekhnaa ahm hoga ki modi sarkaar ritred ardhsainik balon kii maang par vichaar karti he yaa nahin

 According to the study, humans are the only caste in which one sex age is more than the other

 However, in some other species such as round worm, fruitfly and some mammal animals, there is a difference in the life of male and female

 Of course, his role was light-hearted
 lekin is film ke saath unke naam dhooma-3 ke baad ek or badi film darj ho gai he
 Anyway, this year the Pro Kabaddi League started and his team won the championship
 khaas yah ki unke role ko film vishleshkon ne kaaphi saraahaa bhi he
 Regarding the role of Tapori Nandu Bhide in the film, Komal Nahata says, "abhishek Bachchan is superb in Nandu's role and kills life with tremendous timing in comic scenes

 teji se ho rahe saamaajik badlaav ke is daur main ab kai purush khud ko laachaar va asurakshit mahasoos karne lage hai
 This is the reason that in response to the 'women's Commission', now the demand for a 'men's Commission' has started to arise

 Taking strict steps towards this, the 'election Declaration' was also issued by the institution, which included the 10-point demands of men
 samiti kii adhyaksh indu subhash ne lakhanu main shanivaar ko press club main yojit shradhanjali kaarykram ke maukey par kaha ki sarkaar aae din mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye kanoon bana rahi he, lekin purushon ke liye koi kanoon nahin banaaya ja rahaa he
 Men are being harassed by making gender-based laws
 unhone kaha ki nari shashaktikaran ke yug main purushon ke adhikaron ko andekha kiya ja rahaa he, jiske chalate aae din purush aatmahatya kar rahe hai or sanyukt parivaar bikharate ja rahe hai
 The ten-year NCRB data itself states that men are committing suicide in double the number of women
 unhone kaha ki jari kiye gaye is ghoshnaa patr ke madhyam se purushon ke adhikaron kii maang kii gai he, taaki purushon ke liye sarkaar dwaara kanoon banaae jaaen
 While issuing the manifesto, NCM President Amit Gupta said that if his demands are ignored, for this, a political party will be formed and joined in the Lok Sabha elections 2014 and will raise voice among the public for the rights of men
 unhone kaha ki mahila hi nahin, purush bhi gharelu hinsa ke shikaar hote hai, jiske chalate maujuuda daur main ladaai-jhagade ke chalate sanyukt parivaar kaa bikharaav ho rahaa he

 sachin tendulkar to aitihaasik shatak nahin bana paae lekin rahul dravid ne cricket ke makka lords par shandaar shatak jamaakar bharat ko england ke khilaaf pehle test cricket main foloan se bachaa liya
 Tendulkar returned to the pavilion after scoring 34 runs before reaching the close of his 100th international century, but Dravid, despite falling wickets continuously, hit an unbeaten 103-run knock on the wall at one end
 unki patibaddhta or sankalpapurna bemisaal pari se bharat ne apni pehali pari main 286 ran banaae
 England had declared their first innings ended by scoring 474 runs for eight wickets and got a big lead of 188 runs in the first innings
 usne tisare din kaa khel samaapt hone tak duusari pari main bina kisi nuksaan ke paanch ran banaae
 England's overall lead is now 193 runs and they have tightened their grip on the match
 bharat ke liye buree khabar yah he ki jahir duusari pari main bhi gendbaaji ke liye nahin utre
 Stuart Broad played a key role in giving England the lead, with speculation about his inclusion in the playing XI before the match
 broad ne 37 ran dekar chaar wicket liye
 Apart from him, Chris Tremlett took three and James Anderson took two wickets
 dravid ne apane kariyar kaa 33waan, england ke khilaaf chauthaa or lords par pehla shatak jamaaya
 He also left Steve Va (32 centuries) with this century
 is star ballebaaj ne apni pari main 220 gend kheli tathaa 15 chauke lagaae
 All eyes on Lord's were studded with Tendulkar's century, but Dravid was the hero of the Indian innings
 unhen subah jald hi krij par kadam rakhana padaa or duusare chor se lagaataar wicket girane ke baavjood ek chor se vah ran banaate rahe
 'mr Trustworthy' came out to bat when India lost Gambhir's wicket on a score of 63 runs
 broad ne outswinger par gambhir kaa middle stump ukhadkar bharat ko pehla jhatka diya tha
 He then sentenced Mukund to hasten to complete his half-century
 broad kii baahar jaati gend unke balle kaa andruni kinaaraa lekar of stump ukhaad gai
 When Tendulkar stepped to the crease, the audience stood up and greeted him
 tendulkar ke mahashatak kaa sabhi gavaah bananaa chaahate the or unhone bhi sakaaratmak shuruyaat kii
 At lunch, India's score was 102 for two wickets
 tendulkar ne duusare satr ke pehle over main anderson par do chauke jamaaye
 Dravid also hit three fours in the same bowler's over, after which Andrew Strauss replaced him with off-spinner Graeme Swann
 tendulkar haalanki dhime pad gaye the or strans jab broad ko duusare spel ke liye waapas laae, to unhone aate hi bhartiya cricket premiyon ko sann kar diya
 Tendulkar caught Swann in the second slip and returned to the pavilion
 unhone baahar jaati gend ko sharir kaa istemaal kiye bina khelnaa chaha, jo unke balle kaa bahari kinaaraa lekar kaich main badal gai
 The government has no plans to ban petrol and diesel vehicles in the near future
 haalanki sarkaar paryaavaran ko bachaane or kachche tel ke aayaat main katautee ke liye electric vaahanon ke istemaal ko badhaava dene kaa prayaas karti rahegi
 Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said these things in the Central Government
 darasal, beete dinon vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne aam bajet pesh karte hue electric vaahanon par jor dete hue kai bade elaan kiye
 In such a situation, there are speculations that the government may ban petrol and diesel vehicles in the coming days
 haal hi main bajaj auto ke emdi rajeev bajaj ne bhi sarkaar kii yojana par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 Rajiv Bajaj had said in an interview that the government's plan on electric vehicle is not practical
 halaat aise ban rahe hai ki auto mekars ko apni dukaan band karne kii naubat aa sakati he
 What did Dharmendra Pradhan say? In the midst of these questions, Dharmendra Pradhan said, "is there any government document which states that petrol and diesel vehicles will be stopped from this date
 bharat aisa karne kaa jokhim nahin uthaa saktaa he
 "pradhan said that petroleum products are still the most in demand in the transport sector and to meet the requirement of such vehicles, different types of fuels are required
 unhone iske saath hi kaha, " hamen sienji , pienji, jaiveendhan or byogas kii jarurat hogi
 "let's say that 21 in 2018-19 in India
 16 karod ton petroleum utpaadon kii khapat hui thi
 Diesel share in it 8
 35 karod ton or petrol kaa 2
 83 million tonnes
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki bharat main urja kii maang duniya main sabase tej gati se bad rahi he or koi bhi ek strot is maang ko puraa nahin kar saktaa he
 Many fuels will need different options for this
 desh main ek april 2020 se euro- chah maanak ke petrol, dijal kaa istemaal shuru hoga
 Along with this, the government is emphasizing on increasing the use of CNG in vehicles, especially in public vehicles

 Book: Eradication of Superstition (first Part) Publisher: Reality Publication Writer: Narendra Dabholkar Editor: Dr
 sunil kumaar lavatinuvadakbadow
 Chanda Girishkit: People who are 150 rupees, whether they are scientists or doctors, because they fall prey to superstition
 duusari ore vaigyanik baton ke sanskaar aaj kii shiksha main athwa samaaj main najar nahin aate or vaigyanik vipareet vyavhaar karte hai
 If this is to be avoided, then an array has to be created, which will be designed as follows
 1
 The first symptom of man is to behave according to rational thoughts
 asangat vichaaron par aadhaarit vyavhaar usko parajeet hi karata he
 The path based on inconsistent ideas, even if it seems appropriate, seems to be progressing, is still undesirable, this should be kept in mind
 2
 If superstitious behavior promotes exploitation openly, then there is a need for law
 bhagwaan kii ajna kaa andaaj lagaakar hi chunaav main khadaa hone yaa na hone kaa nirnay lenaa andhvishwaspurn kaary he
 Calling someone personal freedom would prove it right
 lekin koi vyakti chor he athwa nahin, yah sabit karne ke liye kisi jaagrath devtaa ke saamne use ubalte tel main haath daalane ke liye majaboor karnaa na keval andhvishwaas he, balki shoshan he
 There should be a law against it
 abhi tak aisa kanoon samooche bharat main kahin bhi nahin banaaya gaya he
 It is made in 2013 in Maharashtra
 aise samaaj main rahane vaale vaigyanik agar doharaa avaigyanik vyavhaar karte hai, to isamen aashcharya nahin hona chahie
 3
 andhvishwaas ke viruddh janajagran kaa kaary nibasancoch nidarta se or prabhavi dhang se hona chahie
 It is the spread of awakening
 is kaary kii kuch simaaen bhi hoti hai
 Most of the time, directly and indirectly, it discusses religion
 isiilie is kaary kaa virodh kiya jaataa he
 Right from childhood, human beings have the influence of religion and traditional ethics in the home and society everywhere
 televijan channelon par nirarthak, avaigyanik dharawahikon kaa nirantar prasaaran hota rahata he
 In schools, discussion of any religion is avoided under the guise of universal religion
 vaigyanik ke avaigyanik vyavhaar ko sudhaarney ke liye jaagarukta anivaary ho gai he
 But the harsh truth is that superstition is only in the main places of public awareness
 4
 Rites of unscientific thought are deeply ingrained in the human mind from childhood
 is antarman main pravesh karne ke liye keval janajagran paryaapt nahin he
 There is also a need to cite examples from our work
 swayan main vah nidarta honi chahie, vipareet parinaamon kaa dar man main nahin hona chahie
 Today's education system is not ready to survey such things
 gaadi durghatnagrast na ho isliye us par neembu or mirch baandhi jaati he
 This superstition can be overcome by surveying vehicles that do and do not do so
