 If your car was drowned then a lot could have been saved
 isliye hamen water level se aage jaakar flud forcast or starm water forcast kii taraf badhanaa hoga tabhi ham janmaal kaa nuksaan bachaa sakate hai
 We also have to tell how long the flood water will remain in your area
 tippaniyan There is news of improvement in flood situation from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan i
e
 water level has started coming down
 madhya pradesh main satna or reva baadh se sabase zyaada prabhavit rahe
 On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh has been flooded in many areas of Allahabad, Mirzapur, Varanasi, Mahoba, Banda and Unnao
 ganga or uski sahaayak nadiyaan yahaan khatare ke nishaan se upar bah rahi hai
 The surrounding ghats are submerged in the Ganges waters in Varanasi
 manikarnika ghat or harishchandra ghat doobane kii vajah se shavon kaa dah-sanskaar yahaan ab ghaaton se upar ho rahaa he
 Even Ganga Aarti is happening on the roofs
 varanasi main varuna nadi bhi ufaan par he, jisaki vajah se uske aasapaas based das hazaar parivaar prabhavit hue hai
 In Allahabad too, the Ganges water has entered the residential areas
 jab aap bhi bahut mehnat se yaad karke imtahaanon main likhte the ki baadh aati he to uske saath pahaado se upjau gaad maidaanon kii taraf aata he
 a new layer of soil is formed with nutrients
 pune ke professor vishwaas kaale se hamane poocha to unhone kaha ki baadh nadi kii jivan prakriya kaa ahm hissaa he
 The life cycle of the river is not complete without flooding
 baadh ke saath aane vaali nai mitti ke kaaran kheton kii urvartaa kaaphi bad jaati he
 This is the reason why farming has been taking place in the ganga-yamuna plain for thousands of years, but the fertility there never decreased
 desh kii pachaas karod kii aabaadi ganga-yamuna ke maidan main basati he
 Not only this, the river channel is constantly clearing due to floods
 badi yaa choti nadiyaan apane saath saamaanya samay main jo cediment, ret-pathar apane saath laati hai or kinaaron ke aasapaas jamaa karti jaati hai, usase nadi kaa channel sankara or uthlaa hota jaataa he jisase nadiyon main pani bahane kii jagah kam hoti jaati he
 When a major flood occurs, it takes this entire silt forward and keeps the river channels clear
 naale ke rup main sankuchit ho chuki nadi phir se fail jaati he
 The floods of the river liberate the areas on which its banks are occupied from the sand mafia to the land mafia
 baadh aane se nadiyon ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main underground water richarge hota he, jo saal ke baaki samay main pani kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne ke kaam aata he
 The larger the area that will be flooded, the more the area will have water recharge
 hamane baadh par puri zindagi adhyayan karne vaale professor dinesh mishra se baat kii
 There are very few people who research floods
 main chahta tha ki ve 'prime time' main aa jaaen, lekin unhen aaj kisi yatra par janaa tha
 When i asked Prof
 Mishra whether flood was a disaster, there was catastrophe, his reply was that flood is not a disaster for Bihar
 agar aapadaa hoti, tabaahi laati to bihar main jansankhya kaa ghanatv kaaphi kam hota
 People would leave the state
 koi apni zamin chhod kar isliye nahin jaataa, kyonki bihar kii zamin isi baadh ke kaaran upjau he
 The water level here is good, that is why you do not see women carrying water from far away, like Haryana or Rajasthan
 pro mishra ne kaha ki baadh ek laabhadaayak dhandha he
 After 9 years in Bihar, there has been such a flood, due to which the land here has been revived
 jab kosi kii baadh ai thi tab anupam mishra ne ek lekh likhaa tha - tairne vaala samaaj dub rahaa he
 He said that the flood was not a guest
 wo achaanak nahin aati he, balki uske aane kii taarikh tay he
 This is why we treat him like a calamity when a flood comes
 anupam mishra ne likhaa tha ki sochiye jab sarkarein nahin thim, helicopter nahin tha tab log baadh se kaise apni raksha karte honge, kyonki jis zamin par ve rahete aae hai, vahaan baadh to sadiyon se aa rahi he
 We have settled in the path of flood, flood never comes in our way
 baadh se tabaahi kyon hoti he
 One reason is that we have all encroached on the banks of the river
 chunki kai saal tak baadh nahin aati he, isliye ham sochate hai ki baadh kabhi nahin aegi
 Then we start working on the idea of connecting rivers in different ways
 kuch kaa kuch dimag lagaate chalate hai
 But one day there is flood
 ab puuchhiye ki janmaal kaa nuksaan kyon hota he
 Can it be saved aap jaanate hai ki bharat main baba aadam ke jamaane se baadh kii bhavishyavaanee kii ja rahi he
 This prediction is made on the basis of the danger mark
 aap samaacharon main sunate bhi honge ki falaan jagah par ganga yaa punpun kaa pani khatare ke nishaan se itnaa centimetre upar bah rahaa he to baadh aegi
 At around 175 places in the country, such danger marks have been made, on the basis of which the flood is predicted
 is system ko gej tu gej korelation kehete hai
 Like you heard that the water of the Ganges in Patna is flowing above the danger mark
 iske liye kareeb saath-sattar kimi pehle ek or jagah par jalastr ko napa jaataa he
 It has a historical data, on the basis of which it is said that if the water there is above the danger mark, then flood water will come in Patna's Mahendru Ghat or LCT Ghat
 yadi aap patna ke puraane darshak hai to yaad kiijie ham or aap bachapan main kaise bans ghat yaa mahendru ghat jate the, yah dekhne ki kitni sidhiyon tak pani aa gaya he
 If water reaches such a ladder, the flood water will enter the city
 jaahir he isse pataa chalata he ki jal str se baadh kaa khatara naapane kaa system lok jivan kaa hissaa ban gaya hoga
 This would have made an accurate prediction, only then from the government to the common citizens believe in this prediction
 radio anounsar jab khanakdaar awaz main kehete the ki patna main ganga kaa jalastr khatare ke nishaan se das centimetre upar bah rahaa he
 On hearing this, people used to go to the terrace with potato onions
 aasmaan main dekhne lagate the ki helicopter se chanaa or biscuit koi giraayega
 But gradually, all the pictures of the flood were devastated
 log marane lage, makaan doobane lage or kitna kuch nasht hone laga
 Why did this happen
 hamane is kshetra ke ek or jaankaar se baat kii
 He says that India has a system of water level forecasts, that is, forecasts based on water level
 bharat ko ab flud forcast karnaa chahie yani yah bataanaa chahie ki aapke ilaake main baadh kaa pani kab tak aayega, kitna upar chadhega or kab tak rahegaa
 This probably happens in the rest of the world
 paanch chah din pehle se alert jari hone lagate hai
 If there were flood forecasts in India, hundreds of people would not have died due to floods in Chennai, people would not have died by drowning in their own houses
 agar hamen baadh se hone vaale nuksaan ko rokna he to flud forcast kii taraf kadam badhaane honge
 At present, the water level is predicted by the Central Water Commission
 jalastr kii bhavishyavaanee kii ek seemaa he
 You measure the danger mark at two places between fifty-sixty km, but there is no system of prediction if water suddenly comes in the middle and spreads to the surrounding area
 jaise maan lijie chennai ke kinare kii nadi main jal str bad gaya lekin baari varsha ke kaaran shahar main pani kii maatra duusari taraf se bad gai
 Now there should be a system of calculating it and how deep the flood is going to happen in Chennai
 isliye jo log pehali manzil ke makaan main rah rahe hai unhen kam se kam do manzila makaan kii chat par janaa hoga
 it does not happen
 duusari kami yah he ki ham starm water forcast nahin karte hai
 Storm water is called rainwater
 yah ek kism kii shahari baadh he
 Where there are no rivers, there is flooding from storm water
 agar ham varsha kii maatra ke aadhaar par yah bataa saken ki gudgaanv yaa dilli main itani millimetre barish hogi to sadakon par pani bhar saktaa he
 If your car was drowned then a lot could have been saved
 isliye hamen water level se aage jaakar flud forcast or starm water forcast kii taraf badhanaa hoga tabhi ham janmaal kaa nuksaan bachaa sakate hai
 We also have to tell how long the flood water will remain in your area

 jaise maan lijie chennai ke kinare kii nadi main jal str bad gaya lekin baari varsha ke kaaran shahar main pani kii maatra duusari taraf se bad gai

 isliye jo log pehali manzil ke makaan main rah rahe hai unhen kam se kam do manzila makaan kii chat par janaa hoga
 it does not happen
 duusari kami yah he ki ham starm water forcast nahin karte hai

 water level has started coming down
 madhya pradesh main satna or reva baadh se sabase zyaada prabhavit rahe
 On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh has been flooded in many areas of Allahabad, Mirzapur, Varanasi, Mahoba, Banda and Unnao
 ganga or uski sahaayak nadiyaan yahaan khatare ke nishaan se upar bah rahi hai
 The surrounding ghats are submerged in the Ganges waters in Varanasi
 manikarnika ghat or harishchandra ghat doobane kii vajah se shavon kaa dah-sanskaar yahaan ab ghaaton se upar ho rahaa he
 Even Ganga Aarti is happening on the roofs
 varanasi main varuna nadi bhi ufaan par he, jisaki vajah se uske aasapaas based das hazaar parivaar prabhavit hue hai
 In Allahabad too, the Ganges water has entered the residential areas
 aisa kyon hua
 We spoke to another person in the area
 unka kahana he ki bharat main water level forcast kii vyavastha he yani jalastr ke aadhaar par bhavishyavaanee kii jaati he
 India should now forecast flood, that is, it should tell how long flood water will come in your area, how high it will rise and how long it will last
 aisa shaayad duniya ke baaki deshon main hota he
 Alerts start five to six days in advance
 agar bharat main flud forcast hota to chennai main baadh se saikadon log nahin marate, log apane hi makaan main dub kar nahin marate
 If we have to stop the damage caused by floods, then we have to step towards flood forecasts
 is vakt jalastr kii bhavishyavaanee central water kamishan karata he
 There is a limit to the prediction of water level
 aap pachaas-saath kimi ke bich do jagahon par khatre ke nishaan ko maapte hai, lekin agar bich main achaanak se pani aa jaae or aasapaas ke ilaake main fail jaae to uski bhavishyavaanee kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 For example, suppose the water level in the river bordering Chennai increased but due to heavy rains, the amount of water in the city increased from the other side
 ab iskaa hisaab lagaakar bataane kii vyavastha honi chahie ki chennai main kitni gaharaai tak baadh aane vaali he
 Therefore, people who are staying in the first floor house will have to go to the roof of at least two floors
 yah nahin hota he
 The second drawback is that we do not forecast storm water
 starm water varsha ke pani ko kehete hai
 It is a kind of urban flood
 jahaan nadiyaan nahin hoti he vahaan, starm water se baadh aati he
 If we can tell on the basis of the amount of rainfall that there will be so much millimeter of rain in Gurgaon or Delhi, then the roads can get filled with water
 aapaki car dub sakati he to kaaphi kuch batch saktaa tha
 Therefore, we have to go beyond water level towards flood forecast and storm water forecast, only then we can save loss of life and property
 hamen yah bhi bataanaa hoga ki baadh kaa pani aapke ilaake main kab tak rahegaa
 The comments madhya pradesh or rajasthan se baadh kii sthiti main sudhaar kii khabar he yani pani kaa str kam hone laga he
 Satna and Rewa were the most affected by floods in Madhya Pradesh
 udhar uttar pradesh main elahabaad, mirzapur, varanasi, mahoba, banda or unnav ke kai ilaakon main baadh ai hui he
 The Ganges and its tributaries are flowing above the danger mark here
 varanasi main ganga ke pani main aasapaas ke ghat duube hue hai
 Due to the sinking of Manikarnika Ghat and Harishchandra Ghat, cremation of dead bodies is now being done above the ghats here
 yahaan tak ki ganga aarti bhi chhaton par ho rahi he
 The Varuna River is also in spate in Varanasi, affecting ten thousand families around it
 elahabaad main bhi ganga kaa pani rihaayshi ilaakon main ghus gaya he
 If there were flood forecasts in India, hundreds of people would not have died due to floods in Chennai, people would not have died by drowning in their own houses
 agar hamen baadh se hone vaale nuksaan ko rokna he to flud forcast kii taraf kadam badhaane honge
 At present, the water level is predicted by the Central Water Commission
 jalastr kii bhavishyavaanee kii ek seemaa he
 You measure the danger mark at two places between fifty-sixty km, but there is no system of prediction if water suddenly comes in the middle and spreads to the surrounding area
 jaise maan lijie chennai ke kinare kii nadi main jal str bad gaya lekin baari varsha ke kaaran shahar main pani kii maatra duusari taraf se bad gai

 uttar pradesh main 40 lakh registerd kisaanon vaale ganna vibhaag ke cabinet mantri suresh rana ganne ko sidhe bazaar se jodgaye ke prayaason main jute hai
 Suresh Rana is busy working out plans to bring sugarcane juice to market, branding jaggery through jaggery festival and making ethanol directly from sugarcane juice
 haalanki ganne kaa kharid mulya na badhaane se vipakshi dal bhaajapa sarkaar par sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 What is the government's strategy for sugarcane? For this, Suresh Rane had a detailed conversation with 'india Today' at his residence on Kalidas Marg in Lucknow on 10 December
 upi main lagaataar do varsh se ganne ke kharid mulya main badhotaree kyon nahin kii gai he?ganna kisaanon ke samaybaddh bhugtan par mukhyamantri ji kaa focus he
 Earlier, farmers were not paid for five years, today 15-20 days, payment is being made in a month
 aaj 80 se zyada milon kaa shatpratishat bhugtan ho chukaa he
 After coming to the Yogi government in Uttar Pradesh, about 76 thousand crore rupees have been paid to the sugarcane farmers, which is the largest payment of any state after independence
 yah desh ke kai rajyon kaa kul bajet nahin he
 When the BJP government was formed, there was a six-year payment due to sugarcane farmers in UP
 ab vah sara bhugtan karaayaa ja chukaa he
 The farmer is not happy with not increasing the purchase price? It is not
 march, 2017 main upi main bhaajapa sarkaar banane se pehle ganna kisaanon kaa lagaataar ganne kii kheti ke prati rujhaan ghat rahaa tha
 Sugarcane production is measured by crushing
 varsh 2014-15 main ganne kii perai 74 karod kuntal thi jo varsh 2015-16 aate-aate vah 64 karod kuntal rah gai thi
 In the previous Akhilesh government, crushing of 10 crore sugarcane took place in a year because the SP government had consistently ignored the payment of sugarcane farmers
 bhaajapa sarkaar aane ke baad 64 karod kuntal se ganna kii perai aaj batchqar 111 karod kuntal ho gai he
 Meaning the yield of sugarcane farmers has almost doubled
 jab bhaajapa sarkaar bani thi pradesh main 66 ton prati hectare ganne ke utpaadan kaa ausat tha aaj yah batchqar 80 ton ho gaya he
 The standard of how much the government is doing for a crop is that its area is decreasing that it is increasing
 march, 2017 main jab yogi sarkaar ne upi kii satta sanbhali thi tab ganna kaa kshetrafal 20 lakh hectare tha aaj yah batchqar 28 lakh hectare ho gaya he
 Eight hundred thousand in thirty months
 kshetrafal badha or 120 lakh ton chini kaa utpaadan hua jo desh main sabase zyada he
 This is a clear indication that the sugarcane farmer is happy with the policies of the Yogi government
 kharid mulya na badhaane se ganna kisaanon kii aay doguni karne kaa lakshya kaise puraa hoga?aaj upi kii adhiktar chini milon kaa pichley saal kaa bhugtan ho chukaa he
 Three thousand crore rupees is outstanding out of 33 thousand crore rupees
 30 maheene kaa 70 hajaar karod rupye kaa bhugtan kiya he
 In the year 2016-17, the SP government had paid Rs 18,003 crore to the sugarcane farmers, whereas in the year 2017-18, the Yogi government has paid 35,400 crore to the sugarcane farmers in a year
 is tarah se kisaanon kii aay doguni karne kaa kaary upi kii yogi sarkaar ne kiya he
 For the first time, the Central Government has fixed the minimum selling price of Kuntal sugar at Rs
 2900, which has since been increased from Rs
 200 to Rs
 3100
 isse bazaar 3100 kuntal par chini kaa mulya sthir he
 After independence, for the first time, a government has reduced the fare of cane farmers
 pehle ganna kisaan 8
 75 per quintal used to pay freight, now the government has increased it to 42 paise per quintal
 upi main ganne kii quality par kai baar sawaal uthe hai?sarkaar ne pradesh main ganne kii sabhi rejected verieti ko nirast kar diya he
 It has shown its effect
 maharashtra ganne se chini kii recovery main hameshaa top karata tha
 In the last 70 years, it has never happened that UP has topped the recovery
 varsh 2019 pehla saal he jisamen upi main 11
 With a recovery of 46, UP has secured the first position in the country
 upi main band chini milen sarkaar par bhaar ban gai hai?basapa sarkaar ke dauraan varsh 2007-12 ke bich upi main 19 chini milon ko band kiya gaya
 Between 2012-17, 10 sugar mills were closed
 basapa or sapa ke shasankaal ke 10 varshon main kul 29 chini milen band huin
 The BSP government sold 21 sugar mills made from the hard earned income of farmers at throwaway prices
 bhaajapa sarkaar ne ramala, bagpat main 400 karod kii laagat se nai chini mil lagaai he or usamen 27 megawatt kaa kojen plant lagaaya he
 The capacity of the sugar mill of Mohdipur is doubled
 chandausi, saharanpur, devaria, siddharthanagar, paderuna main chini milen shuru kii gai hai
 In 2009, during the BSP regime, three farmers who were protesting for starting a sugar mill in Munderwa, Basti, were killed by police firing
 yogi sarkaar ne is mil ko 400 karod kii laagat se pun: shuru kiya he
 The new sugar mill is installed in Pipraich, Gorakhpur with a 27-kilowatt Kogen plant
 ek mil chalane se 4 xxrep 4 0 kisaanon ko sidhaa phayda hota he vahiin 10 se 12 hajaar rojgaar ke avasar paidaa hote hai
 In addition, a thousand people indirectly benefit
 is tarah se ek chini mil se kareeb deb lakh logon ko pratyaksh-apratyaksh rojgaar miltaa he
 Benefit dedh darjan chini milon kii kshamta badhaane kaa kaam kiya he
 It is being planned to upgrade all the dilapidated sugar
 jitani bhi band milen hai un sabhi band milon ko charanbaddh dhang se chalaaya jayega
 Sugarcane farmer dependence on sugar is increasing for payment? Sugarcane farmer was dependent on sugar for payment
 bazaar main chini ke daamon par hi ganna kisaanon ke bhugtan kii kathinaayee tay hoti thi
 Gorakhpur's Pipraich will become the first sugar mill in North India to manufacture ethanol directly from sugarcane juice
 isse chini ke daam antarrashtriya bazaar main kya he isse ganna kisaanon ko koi fark nahin padegaa
 Ethanol production will reduce the country's dependence on petrochemicals
 aaj upi desh main sabase zyada ethnaul kii aapurti karata he
 UP has achieved the highest percentage in the country, which the Prime Minister gave the goal of 'blending' ethanol in petrochemicals
 is varsh upi ko 81 karod litre ethnaul dbralending kaa target mila he
 17 new distilleries are coming up in UP
 10 se zyada distilleriyon kii kshamta badhaai ja rahi he
 Closed crusher has also increased the problems of the farmers? The previous anti-farmer governments had decided that the distance from the sugar mill to the crusher would be 15 km-aerial distance, that is, 25 km according to the road
 isse dhire-dhire kolhu udyog samaapt ho gaya
 The farmer had no choice but to put sugarcane with the sugar mill
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne gud par saare tex samaapt kar die jisase kutir udyog ke rup main kolhu ko badhaava mila
 Employment opportunities arose
 mukhyamantri ne ab chini mil se kolhu kii duuri 15 kilometre se ghataakar 7
 5 kilometers
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki 25 varsh baad upi main sarkaar ne kolhu ke 101 nae license pichley dedh varsh main jari kiye hai
 They have a total capacity of 26,500 TCD (tons per day of crushing) as many as five new sugar mills
 gud ko protsaahan karne ke liye lakhanu main janvari-farvari maheene main gud mahotsav karenge
 Will be branding jaggery
 ganna kisaan bichauliyon or mafiaon ke bich fansaa he?ab aisa katai nahin he
 The sugarcane slip system has been computerized in the Yogi government
 ab koi bhi galat parchi jari nahin kar saktaa
 The Yogi government has taken action against 29,000 sugarcane mafia
 unke board nirast kiye gaye hai
 Is any policy being prepared for domestic and commercial procurement of sugar? Efforts are on to market sugarcane juice in a tetra pack like other fruit juices
 mukhyamantri ne mujhe iske liye nirdeshit kiya he
 An action plan is also being prepared on how many by-products of sugarcane can be used to provide maximum benefits to the farmers
 varsh 2022 main upi main vidhansabha chunaav hai
 Is there any possibility of increasing the purchase price of sugarcane before this? The price of sugarcane was raised by Rs 10 in the first year of the formation of BJP government
 saath hi paanch se chah rupye sosayadi par ganne kaa kiraaya tha use kam karke kisaanon ko laabh diya tha
 Sugarcane societies have also been raised as commission
 inhen majboot kiya gaya he
 a network of roads has been laid around the sugar mills
 kiraaya ghataana, kolhu license jari karke kisaanon ko laabh dene kaa kaam sarkaar ne kiya he
 There will be competition in the market between the crusher and sugar mills on the price of sugarcane, which will directly benefit the farmers

 pashchim bengal main haal hi main bijepi main shaamil hue netaa mukul roy kii phone tanping ke aaropon ko lekar daayar yachika ko dilli hai court ne khaarij kar diya he
 The Delhi High Court, however, has given this liberty to Mukul Roy that if there is any evidence to prove his allegations, he can knock the court again
 hai court ne mukul roy kii yachika ko pashchim bengal diji, siidi, dilli police ayukta or kuch jaanch agenciyon ke jawaab ke baad khaarij kii he
 The agencies told the charge that the baseless agencies had told the court in their sealed reply that all the allegations of Roy are baseless
 abhi tak unke chaar main se kisi bhi phone number ko intercept nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 During the hearing, the lawyers of the Central Government and the Government of West Bengal opposed the petition saying why Mukul Roy filed the petition in Delhi itself
 kya bengal main court nahin he, jabakimukul royke vakil ne kaha ki bengal kii police unke muvakkil par najar rakh rahi he
 So how could the police there properly investigate
 mamata banerjee par tanping kaa aropapichley maheene mukul roy ne yachika daayar kar apane 4 mobile numberon ko tap kiye jane kaa daawa kiya he
 Roy, once considered to be chief minister of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accused him of tapping
 yachika main kuch dastavej pesh kar yah bhi tark diya gaya he ki unhen police, apane ipies doston or jaanch agenciyon main sutron se pataa chalaa ki unka phone tap ho rahaa he
 Which makes it difficult for him to talk on the phone, forcing him to talk on whatsapp calling

 Publication of books related to politics or politicians is not new when it is election time
 raajnneeti or chunaav se jude kathith taur par rahasyodghatan karne vaali kitaaben dukaanon par namoodaar hone lagati hai
 Since January this year, many such books have started appearing and selling
 par kitaab narendra modi se judi ho to maamla khaas ho jaataa he
 There is no doubt that in the last seven years, as much as Narendra Modi has seen, heard and read in TV, radio, non-personal and newspapers, hardly any other leader would have been given any place
 aise main agar kisi kitaab kaa sheershak narendra modi sensord ho, to maamla chaunkaane vaala hi hoga
 This book is written by Ashok Srivastava, senior anchor of Prasar Bharati's channel and the TV channel DD News, the unofficial representative of the government
 shrivastav tivi kii duniya ke jane-maane naam hai or unki yah kitaab narendra modi ke khilaaf gadhe ja rahe kathith phek nerrative se do-do haath karti he
 The central theme of the Narendra Modi censor is an interview of Narendra Modi, which was taken by Ashok Srivastava for DD News and in which the DD administration tried its best to quash and Qatar
 par yah kitaab aise daur main or adhik dilachasp lag sakati he jab haal hi main chunaav ayog ne didi news ko vibhinn dalon ko die ja rahe air time main gaiyr-barabari kii baat par fatkaar lagaai he
 However, as soon as you take the book in hand, you see a black cover with a picture of Narendra Modi on it to clarify the meaning of the word censored in the title
 modi gaur se aapako hi dekhte hue prathit hote hai
 The title censored in the title is written in Roman, which eats
 is kitaab main shrivastav un patrakaron-buddhijiviyon ko khuleam chunauti dete dikhte hai jo 2014 ke baad se modi raaj main desh main aghoshit apatkaal kaa aarope lagaate rahe hai or kehete hai ki patrakaron ko kaam karne kii azaadi nahin he
 Srivastava says that the journalists who are creating this fake narrator are doing politics, not journalism
 apni baat ko sabit karne ke kram main shrivastav kai dilachasp tathy pesh karte hai
 By the way, it is certain that in the last Lok Sabha election, this interview standing at the crossroads of DD and not being aired was quite disputed
 par 22 adhyyon main ek intervyuu ke ird-gird gumti hui kitaab kai jagahon par doharaav kii shikaar he
 By the way, it is known that an attempt was made to drop this interview of Narendra Modi earlier but later the interview was telecast but he was severely trimmed
 upie ke daur main didi news narendra modi kaa intervyuu prasaarit karne par kyon majaboor hua, shrivastav neisaki antargatha is kitaab main likhi he
 One problem with TV journalists is that while writing in print, their language remains the same as that of TV
 yah baat ek saath hi acchhee or buree donon he
 Simplicity of language can be one thing, but at the same time there is a teasing repetition of many things
 is kitaab kaa pehla adhyay, yah kitaab kyon
 
 
 This proves where Srivastava stands himself
 vah kathith secular patrakaron kaa phek nerrative khadi karne ke liye uphaas udaate hai or phir ashishnutaa ke aarope main puraskaar waapas karne vaale sahityakaron ko aword vaapasi gang kaa naam dete hai
 Srivastava against mob lynching gives the example of Mukesh of Champaran and Pankaj Narang of Delhi who were killed in lynching
 phir unke nishane par punya prusan vaajapeyi or ashutosh aate hai
 Srivastava targets Arvind Kejriwal that he had fired a journalist from his job
 lekin jahaan bhi vah kitaab main atirikt hamalavar or aakraamak dikhe hai unhone mahila patrkaar yaa buddhijivi kahkar kaam chalaa liya he
 However, later in the case with the Prime Minister's permission regarding the book, Srivastava also cites his goodwill that the Prime Minister's Office refused to see the contents of the book
 phir yah kitaab zikr karti he ki kis tarah unke channel ne narendra modi ke saakshaatkaar ko lekar anmanaapan dikhaaya or kistarah shrivastav ne badi kathinaayee se ise puraa kiya
 It is true that as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi was blacked out on dd's main news channel and his news was not shown
 par loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke samay duusare tivi channelon kii tarah didi par bhi unki reliyon se mahatvapurn hisse dikhaae jate the, yah bhi utana hi sach he
 Srivastava has mentioned Modi's absence in his book, which is true, but he has forgotten an election program like dd's mandate, in which Modi's rallies were daily reported
 shrivastav is baat kaa zikr karnaa bhul gaye ki 16 may ko matganana ke din thik shaam 4 baje modi par aadhe ghante kii documentry prasaarit hui thi
 It takes a long time to make a documentary and obviously DD News has already prepared it
 shrivastav ko apni kitaab main in baton kaa bhi zikr karnaa chahie tha ki sensorship ke us daur main yah kaise mumkin hua hoga
 Srivastava in his book to be broadcast with pauses, cuts and crores of Modi interviews, then DG S
 em
 Blame Khan
 vah unka naam lete hai, (gauratlab he ki modi sarkaar aane ke baad khan ko haashie par daal diya gaya or phir vah ritair ho gaye) par suvidhajanak tareeke se un ediji yaa samachar nideshkon kaa naam ujagar nahin kiya gaya he jo chhipe taur par sandeshon ke jariye shrivastav ke intervyuu kii tarif kar rahe the or ek tarah se unke saath the
 However, DD News is a toy in the hands of government officials and a puppet of the government
 endie, phir upie ne, or phir modi sarkaar ne apni tarah se iskaa istemaal kiya he
 The banner of publicity of government schemes on the screen behind newswriters just before the election is an example of this
 yah prachaar kis besharmi se kiya gaya he iskaa udhaaharan he ki ek bulatin main samachar vaachika khabar to pulavama hamale kaa pard rahi thi par uske peeche screen par lagaataar ujjwala yojana kaa binar laga hua tha
 It lasted the whole time, in every bulletin, everyday
 baharhaal, kitaab kaa kalevar upar se acha he par bheetar pannon main pruf kii galtiyaan ughadakar saamne aati hai
 And pre-election interesting sentences are tempered
 yahaan tak ki kitaab ke pichley aavaran panne (blarb) par bhi galtiyaan jaayaka kharaab karti hai
 The book seems to have been written and published in haste
 kitaab kisi achche sampadak kii kanchi se hokar guzarati to kasaavat ke saath aa sakati thi
 Of course, through this book, Ashok Srivastava has presented an interesting story by weaving around Modi's interview and he also appears against the fake operative, but at the same time he also wants to set up a counter-narrator against this fake narrator
 We try, which is as unilateral as the intellectual chew of Modi-opponents

 According to the railway officials, IRCTC can auction these two trains to private players or tourism agencies after taking them
 is puri yojana kii abhi deepiar banani he
 It is worth noting that the Railways has decided to hand over some trains in private hands initially, while carrying forward the 100-day agenda
 neshnal federation of indian railway main (NFIR) ne aarope lagaaya he ki bajet se yah baat ujagar ho gai he ki sarkaar railway ke corporatikaran or nijeekaran par 'aakraamak tareeke se' aage badhanaa chaahati he
 Aeroplane-like facilities are the first such train in the country which is perfectly fit for the speed of 200 kmph
 tejas express ke har ek dibbe ko banane main railway ko 3 karod 25 lakh rupye kharch karne pade hai
 Tejas Express will be the first train to run in the country with automatic plug type doors
 yani jab train chalegi to is ke daravaaje automatic tareeke se thik usee tareeke se band ho jaaenge jaise metro train ke daravaaje band hote hai
 Doors will not open in a moving train only when the train stops, only then will it be able to open

 a special pattern has been printed on the entire train and its color has been kept like the rising sun

 It was suggested in the draft report of this committee that the private sector should be allowed to run rides and freight trains to compete with the Indian Railways, railway related basic services and production and construction works, which are not fundamental to the railways
 They should encourage private sector participation

 Homeguard Kailash suspected that Kiran (who was later burnt alive) had a hand in driving her girl away
 isi ko lekar 17 july ko gaanv main birdari kii ek panchayat bulaai gai
 It has been told that Kiran's father Suraj was also summoned in this panchayat and the decree was given that his girl Kiran had a hand in driving away Kailash's girl, so he would have to apologize in the panchayat
 yahi nahin, suraj se yah bhi kaha gaya ki use apni ladki ko ek raat ke liye unhen saunpna hoga
 Kiran's father refused to apologize, denying his girl or any other family member's hand in the case
 bas, kiran ke pita kaa inkaar karnaa panchayat ko akhar gaya or panchayat ne use khamiyaja bhugatne kii dhamkee de daali
 After getting a chance a few days later, after finding Kiran alone, the accused were burnt and ran away

 Later somehow the girl was rushed to hospital in a burnt condition

 Our party workers are already trying to maintain this edge

 The Congress party was still recovering from the loss caused by Mani Shankar Aiyar's statement that PM Modi was a 'low man', that a statement by Alpesh Thakor, a newly-joined Gujarat Congress, has created a new problem
 ayyar ne to apane bayaan par maafee maang lee he, lekin lagata nahin ki alpesh apane bayaan par maafee maangenge
 Alpesh is a young OBC leader from Gujarat and has made his mark in Gujarat politics
 lekin apane nirarthak or alp jaankaree vaale bayaan se unhone khud apana majaak bana liya he
 Addressing a rally in Gujarat on the last day of campaigning, Alpesh Thakor said that PM Modi's color was dark, but he has become 'white' by eating imported mushrooms, which cost Rs 80,000 a piece
 thakor ne kaha ki modi har din is mashroom kaa 5 pis khate hai or vah jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, tab se is mashroom ko kha rahe hai
 Thus according to Thakor PM Modi only 1 every month to eat this mushroom
 2 karod rupee kharch kar rahe hai
 After this statement of Thakor, not only did the mime war on Twitter, but the word 'imported mushroom' started trending
 yugers tamaam netaaon or celebrity ke mashroom khaane ke pehle or mashroom khaane ke baad kii photo share karne lage
 You are wrong Alpesh Bhaiham, i want to tell Alpesh Bhai Thakor that this statement is okay to take a political comment or pinch on PM Modi, but as a responsible politician, he has made a factually incorrect statement
 yah koi raaj kii baat nahin he ki piem modi ko kai tarah ke mashroom pasand hai
 His favorite mushroom is also quite expensive, but not as much as alphese brothers are saying
 mashroom se blad pressure se lekar cancer par kaabo tak ke swasthya ke lihaaj se kai phaayde jarur hai, lekin vah nahin jo alpesh thakor bataa rahe hai
 Whether the mushroom is 8 rupees or 80,000 rupees, it cannot make anyone blond

 iskaa utpaadan nahin kiya ja saktaa or ise prakritik rup se hi hasil kiya jaataa he
 It is found in the jungles on the high mountains of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir and grows only in the period between the snow rising and melting
 ab chunki yah bahut kam paaya jaataa he, isliye isaki keemat kabhi-kabhi 30,000 rupee kilo tak pahunch jaati he
 a lot of mushroom comes in a kilo though, as it is sold when it dries
 ausatan dekhen to gucchhi mashroom 10,000 rupee kilo mil jaataa he
 However, if you are familiar with the mountains, then it can also be found very cheap
 asal main piem modi ne kai saal tak ek party kaaryakarta ke rup main himachal main rahakar kaam kiya he, isliye vahaan ke oonche pahaado par unke kai mitra hai
 They liked the mushroom because the vegetarians in the mountains need a lot of protein and hot foods
 vaise to piem ise roj nahin khate, lekin unhone is baat ko sweekaar kiya he ki gucchhi mashroom unhen kaaphi pasand he
 They eat it themselves, they also like to feed guests
 piem modi jab videshi daure par hote hai, to aksar unke khaane ke menu main vahaan kaa sthaneey mashroom hota he
 But he never went to Taiwan
 alpesh thakor ke bayaan kii baat karen to yah baat sach he ki taiwan main mashroom paaya jaataa he, lekin vah piem modi kii pasand nahin he
 Modi himself has said that when Rajendra Modi was the Chief Minister of Health, he once told some journalists on record that the secret of his health is the mushroom of Himachal Pradesh

 (air India aircraft - file photo) apni kism ke ek ajeebogareeb faisle main guwahati hai court ne us prastaav ko radd kar diya, jiske jariye kendriya jaanch beuro yani sibiai kaa gathan kiya gaya tha or saath hi kaha he ki sibiai kii sari karravaaiyaan ‘asanvaidhanik’ hai
 The central government, which was shocked by the decision of the Guwahati High Court, terming the formation of the Central Bureau of Investigation as unconstitutional, said that it would go to the Supreme Court on Monday at the earliest to challenge the order
 apni kism ke hairaan kar dene vaale aadesh main guwahati ucch nyaayalay ne us prastaav ko radd kar diya he jiske jariye sibiai kaa gathan kiya gaya tha or ucch nyaayalay ne kaha he ki sibiai kii sari karravaaiyaan asanvaidhanik hai
 Additional Solicitor General PP Malhotra said, the decision is wrong
 ham nishchit rup se ise chunauti denge or somvaar ko ucchtam nyaayalay main apil daakhil kiye jane kii sambhaavna he
 a division bench of justices IA Ansari and Indira Shah gave this decision on a writ petition filed by Navendra Kumar challenging the judgment given in 2007 by a High Court judge

 The court further said that the above proposal of the Home Ministry was neither a decision of the Union Cabinet nor did the President approve these executive directives
 ’adaalat ne kaha, ‘isliye sambandhit prastaav ko adhik se adhik ek vibhageeya nirdesh ke rup main liya ja saktaa he jise ‘kanoon’ nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The court then dismissed the chargesheet filed against Kumar by the CBI as well as the hearing
 adaalat ne aage kaha, ‘maamla darj karne, kisi vyakti ko apradhi ke rup main giraftaar karne, jaanch karne, jabti karne, aaropee par mukadmaa chalaane aadi kii sibiai kii gatividhiyaan samvidhan ke anuchhed 21 ko aghat pahunchaati hai or isliye ise asanvaidhanik maanakar radd kiya jaataa he
 The court, however, said that there is no restriction on the police for further investigation on the pending proceedings in the CBI court
 sibiai kaa gathan kiye jane par adaalat ne kaha ki jaanch agency kaa gathan kuch sthitiyon se nipatane ke liye tadarth upaay ke rup main kiya gaya tha
 The court said, "the measure taken by the central government was not in the form of any ordinance but the formation of the CBI was an executive decision and it also did not mention the source of power
" ’ nyaayadhishon ne kaha ki prastaav sibiai ke adhikaar ke strot ke rup main dspi adhinium 1946 ke kisi praavdhaan kaa zikr nahin karata
 The court also said that they had asked the defendants to present the records related to the formation of the CBI but they did not file the original records and produced a verified copy from the National Archives

 is sambandh main sansad ke chaalu sheet satr main arms act (sanshodhan) vidheyak, 2019, ko pesh kiya gaya he
 The Bill talks about amending several provisions of the Arms Act, 1959
 agar banduukon kii sankchaya ko simit karne kii manjuuri mil jaati he to licensodharakon ko is kanoon ke prabhavi hone ke ek saal ke bheetar apane atirikt hathiyaaron ko licensadhari dealron yaa police ke paas jamaa karnaa hoga
 The law to have one gun per person will also apply to those who already have inheritances
 lekin is vidheyak ke anusaar bandook ke license kii vaidhata ab teen saal kii jagah paanch saal tak rahegi
 The Union Home Ministry had called for suggestions and objections regarding the proposed amendments by November 2018
 grih mantralay ne shuru main prati vyakti do bandooken rakhane kaa prastaav rakhaa tha
 According to a Rajya Sabha bulletin, the proposed amendments would enable the 'machinery to implement the law' to curb crimes against illegal weapons more effectively
 'anumaan he ki bharat main kareeb 40 lakh licency hathiyaar hai
 Although it is unclear how many licenses will have this effect, the National Association for Gun Rights India (NAGRI) is against this proposed move
 enegiarai ke sachiv abhijit singh kehete hai, ''semi-automatic or automatic banduukon par pratibandh ke saath license jari karne par bahut zyada niyantran he
 There are many licensees who own three guns, but they have inherited them all
 ve sab puraane samay kii hai or unase kisi ko khatra nahin ho saktaa
 "statistics show that licensed guns rarely commit crimes in the country
" rashtriya aparaadh record beuro ke mutabik, 2016 main arms act ke tahat jabt kiye gaye 37,116 asalhaan main licency yaa vaid factoriyon main bane hathiyaaron kii sankhya keval 1,052 yaa kul hathiyaaron kii maatr 2
 Was 8 percent
 us saal asalha se hone vaali kul 3,775 hatya main 91 pratishat se zyada (3,453) hatya main bina license vaali banduukon kaa istemaal hua
 a large number of suicides were committed by license guns
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar haalanki licency yaa vaid hathiyaaron par apana nishaanaa saadh rahi he lekin aavashyaktaa yah he ki avaidh hathiyaaron se hone vaale kahin zyada bade khatre ke khilaaf kadam uthaaya jaae
 According to a global estimate, the number of illegal weapons in the country 6 in 2017
 14 karod thi
 Apart from this, the heavy stockpile of those weapons captured from the militant organizations is also a big problem, which was snatched away from the security forces by the militant organizations
 police ke sutara bataate hai ki chhattisgarh main maovadi ne suraksha agenciyon se kareeb 1,000 swachaalit or ardh-swachaalit hathiyaar chin chuke hai
 Only 400 of these weapons have been recovered
 nayaa vidheyak kahata he ki suraksha balon ke haathon se hathiyaar chhinane kii sajaa aarthik jurmaane ke saath 10 saal kii jail se lekar umrakaid tak ho sakati he
 Governments of the states bordering Pakistan are concerned about the impact of this proposed bill
 november ke shuru main pradhanmantri narendra modi pakistan ke saath kartarpur coridor kaa udghaatan karne ke liye jab punjab gaye the to rajya ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne unke saamne yah mudda uthaaya tha
 Sources said that Amarinder Singh said that Pakistan is trying to create a crisis again in Punjab, so the move to control arms of private individuals should be stopped for the time being
 iske saath hi shooting spotars kii birdari bhi is vidheyak ko lekar chintit he
 Raninder Singh, president of the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), says, "most of the best performing shooters have taken their initial training in domestic weapons
 unke liye yah kisi nursery kii tarah thi
 Only then did he master the sport in shooting academies or shooting associations
 agar hathiyaaron kii sankhya kam kar di gai to shuruaati training nahin ho paaegi
 He claims that in many states like Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab, the shooters are against the proposed amendments
 hathiyaaron ke kuch licensodharakon ne grih mantralay ke samaksh yah guhaar bhi lagaai he ki kuch marshall jatiyon main hathiyaaron kaa saanskrithik mahatv hota he
 Says a Mumbai lawyer, "arms worship cannot be imagined without weapons on the occasion of Dussehra
" '' patiala ke rajpariwaar se sambandh rakhane vaale runninder singh kehete hai, ''guru govind singh ji ne mughalon ke saath yuddh main maare gaye apane putron ke antim sanskaar jo patiala main hua tha ke baad patiala rajpariwaar ko sammaan ke taur par hathiyaar die the
 "this is not the first time that the Central Government is contemplating a ban on the possession of arms in private through the Arms Act (amendment) Bill
" 1983 main isane hathiyaar rakhane kii sankhya ghataakar teen kar di thi, jabaki usase pehle yah sankhya 'aparibhaashit' thi
 Other provisions of the bill include more stringent punishment, heavy fines, life imprisonment and even capital punishment for possessing a non-licensee or prohibited weapon
 shaadi-byaah jaise utsav ke maukon par bandooken daagne par bhi sarkaar kii najar he kyonki haal ke varshon main isse kai durghatnaayen ho chuki hai
 If someone is found guilty of this crime then he will be charged Rs 1 lakh
 kaa jurmaana hone ke alaava do saal kii jail bhi ho sakati he
 Although people have not questioned such amendments, the decision on the proposal of one person, one weapon is yet to be made
 tir yaa tukkaams act (sanshodhan) vidheyak, 2019 kaa hathiyaar dharakon ke liye kyon mahatvapurn he1hathiyaar rakh saktaa he ek vyakti jabaki philhal use 3 licency hathiyaar rakhane kaa adhikaar he1 salalicensodharakon ko ek ke atirikt hathiyaar arms dealer yaa police ke paas jamaa karaane kaa samay he1 lakh rupejurmaana dena padegaa shaadi yaa dharmik juluson main firing karne vaale ko
 Along with this, two years of imprisonment will also have to be paid 40 lakh estimated licensees are 61 across the country

 The second thing is that perhaps Rakesh Omprakash Mehra had so much to say in the film that he could not decide what to keep and what to cut, due to which the film became very long

 Parts of the story come as a shock - for example, when and how Milkha Singh returned to her home after attacking her brother-in-law, and how the relationship between them recovered
 
 
 saath hi yah bhi samaj nahin aayaa ki milkha singh ko army main chunaa kaise gaya

 The film's rating from me is - 3
 5 star
 
 
 In the film, Dilip Tahil, who appeared in the character of Jawaharlal Nehru, did not fit his character, and i was shocked to see him
 
 
 kahani ke kuch hisson main jhatka lagata he - masalan, apane jija par hamalaa karne ke baad waapas unke ghar milkha singh kab or kaise pahunche, or unke bich rishte kaise thik hue
 
 
 Also, it was not understood how Milkha Singh was elected into the army
 
 
 ek living lijend par film bananaa mushkil kaam kaam he, kyonki ham aise logon ke bare main aksar puri jaankaree rakhte hai
 
 
 Many of you may know every small and big anecdote associated with them, and as a director you might want to remember only a select few of those anecdotes, but the director of the film, Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, was defeated here
 
 
 ek baar phir se kahuunga ki apane seens se pyaar hona acchhee baat he, par unhen kathor dil rakhkar kaat dena or bhi acchhee baat he, kyonki isse film ko phayda hi hoga, nuksaan nahin
 
 
 The comments lekin aisa nahin he ki film main sirf khamiyaan hai, achchhaaiyaan bhi bahut hai
 
 
 The first of which is Farhan's acting and his hard work to get into the character
 
 
 duusare number par he binod pradhan kii behtareen cinemetography
 
 
 At number three is' Alif Allah
 
 
 ' or 'havankund
 
 
 Songs such as' Juban
 
 
 inke alaava film main pawan malhotra or divya datta kii shandaar adaakaari bhi baandhe rakhti he
 
 
 Whatever the scenes are, they manage to touch us, and we remain attached to the story of the living legend
 
 
 haa, kahin-kahin yah zarur laga ki kuch seen khatm kyon nahin ho rahe, lekin vaise, aise seens bhi aapako bahut zyada pareshaan nahin karenge
 
 
 And the best part is that 'bhaag Milkha Bhaag' is a story inspired by which some aspects may not be known to the audience, and through this film, the audience will get to know Milkha Singh more closely
 
 
 meri ore se film kii reating he - 3
 5 stars

 He was declared man of the match
 ireland pehle hi toss jitkar netherland ko ballebaaji saunp chukaa tha jisane paanch wicket par 59 ran banaaye
 In response, Ireland, despite a good start, could only manage 47 runs for seven wickets in the prescribed six overs

 Only three runs were scored in this over
 tippaniyan Mudassar Bukhari gave five runs in the fifth over of the innings and thus Ireland, who needed 32 runs from 24 balls, was challenged to score 20 runs in the last over
