 Advocates of extreme Hinduist or Hindu nationalist ideology, Modi (62) is considered ahead of any leader of his party in promoting public sentiments

 Modi was a pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh before he was elected the Chief Minister of Gujarat and had no administrative experience at the time when he was given the command of the most developed state in the country
 teevr gati se aage badhate jane vaale modi par unke aalochakon kaa aarope he ki shikhar chadhane main madadgaar rahe logon ko hi vah thikaane lagaate rahe hai

 His father Damodardas used to run a small tea shop

 This family's house was such that there was not enough light from the windows
 kiraasana tel par jalanevaali ekmaatr chimney dhuaan or kaalikh ugalati rahati thi

 Athiya Shetty a post shared by Bobby Deol (@iambobbydeol) on Apr 8, 2018 at 4:12am PDT Euro NCAP refers to the European New Car Assessment Program, which started in 1997 and now results are considered in almost the whole of Europe
 darasal varsh 1996 main swedish neshnal road administration (SNRA), international automobil federation (FIA) or internshnal testing sanstha ne milakar yah program pehali baar shuru kiya tha, jisase euro encap kii shuruyaat hui
 Its first result was drawn in the year 1997, after which the car companies severely criticized the stringent criteria of this test, but today the situation is that this rating is considered official worldwide
 darasal, euro encap kaa kaam he nai−nai kaaron ko todna
 Yes, the strength of cars can be tested only by breaking them, so under this test, new cars are crash-tested to know how safe they are - drivers, passengers and even pedestrians
 As well
 inhen paimaanon par aamtaur par paisanger kaaron or SUV kaa krash test hota he, jiske tahat kaaron ko alag-alag angel se krash kiya jaataa he
 All tests are performed in the crash lab, so that all the data related to the collision can be recorded
 kiye jane vaale teston main shaamil hai, frontal impact, yani sidhi takkar, jisamen car jaati he 64 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar se or takaraati he apane baraabar ke vazan vaale ek dhaanche se
 Apart from this, side impact (ie side impact test), and pole impact (ie pillar or tree collision) test
 in sabhi ke alaava pedestrian protection test bhi hota he, jisamen jaancha jaataa he ki agar car kisi paidal yatri se takaraa jaae to unhen kitna nuksaan pahonchega
 After these crash tests, cars get stars, ie stars
 euro encap har nai car par report jari karata he, jisamen pataa chalata he ki car kiske liye kitni sef he
 Including the categories of adult passengers, children, and pedestrians
 har car ko uski sefti ke hisaab se star milte hai
 The safest, i
e
 the safest car gets five stars
 europe ke graahak khud bhi pataa kar sakate hai ki koun-si car kitni sef he
 They have to go to euroncap
 com par, jahaan unhen apni car par clic karnaa hoga
 But it is a pity that in this list there have been only European cars, and Indian cars have just been entered
 aatanki hamalon or lagaataar sijafire ulanghan kii chhaanv main pakistan ke prati dil kii khatas ab seemaa tak pahunch gai he
 There will be no exchange of sweets and gifts between BSF and Pak Rangers on the indo-pak border this time on 14 and 15 August
 pakistani rangeron kii golibari se naaraaz biguef ne is babat faisla kiya he
 The BSF headquarters has informed its security forces in the western sector of the country about this decision
 biguef ke jawan gujarat, rajasthan, punjab or jammu-kashmir main pakistan se lagi antarrashtriya seemaa kii raksha ke liye tainaat hai
 BSF is deployed under the command of the Army on the Line of Control
 biesaf ke ek adhikari ne bataaya, 'pakistanke swatantraaa diwas 14 agast or bharat kii aazaadee ke din 15 agast ko mithai or uphaaron kaa aadan pradaan is baar nahin hoga
 The decision has been conveyed to its units
 'id ke maukey par thukraayaa tha uphargauratlab he ki beete kuch maheenon main donon deshon ke bich sambandhon main khatas badi he
 On the occasion of Eid last month, Pakistan rejected such harmony from India
 donon deshon kii simaaon par tainaat suraksha baljammu mechantararashtriya seemaa or punjab main amritsar ke ataari-bagha seemaa par va rajasthan or gujarat main kuch jagahon par rashtriya utsavon yaa anya avasaron par mithai kaa aadan pradaan karte rahe hai
 Pakistan has been consistently violating ceasefire at the border
 july main hi usne bharat paak seemaa ke paas 19 baar ulanghan kiya he
 Apart from this, the role of Pakistani in the terrorist attacks in Gurdaspur in Punjab and Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir has been well known
 -input bhashaa se Lashing out at bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for taking Gujarat's development model forward, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today rejected it and said that this formula cannot be implemented simultaneously in all states of the country
 rahul ne tejpur loksabhaa kshetra main ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki prayek rajya kaa apana swayan kaa itihaas, gyaan, vichaar evam swayan kaa model hota he
 This formula cannot be implemented in all the states of the country
 unhone kaha ki assam ko gujarat model nahin balki assam model kii jarurat he
 Already, development and progress is being done in the state through this
 congress netaa ne kaha ki gujarat model kaaphi samay se astitv main tha or isko vahaan kii mahilaon, kisaanon or mazdooron ne swaroop pradaan kiya he
 No one person needs to take credit for this
 chunavi sabha main rahul ke saath mukhyamantri tarun gogoi evam assam congress ke pradeshdhyaksh bhubaneshwar kaalitha maujuud the
 He said that the BJP believes in only one idea which can be implemented in the whole country, but it is not a country of one idea
 rahul ne modi ke us daawey ko lekar bhi unhen aade haath liya, jiske tahat unhone kaha tha ki gujarat samooche desh ko doodh kii aapurti karata he
 Rahul said that the state has been doing well in the dairy sector since the 1950s and is not entitled to take credit for it
 unhone kaha ki bijepi kaa maananaa he ki gujarat model ko samooche desh main doharaaya ja saktaa he lekin aisa nahin ho saktaa
 Different states need their own models according to their needs

 brands rahul par uthne lage he sawaal
 When the English newspaper economist raised questions, he saw that the Samajwadi Party could not stop saying that Rahul did not have the words on which he could run the country
 bijepi ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki agar rahul 42 kii umr main piem pad ke liye feet nahin to 52 kii umr main kaise honge
 Now the heat has spread congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ko bhale hi pradhanmantri pad ke agle ummidavaar ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he lekin mahatvapurn masalon par unki chuppi or jimmedaariyon se dur bhaagane kii koshish unki khamiyaan banakar ubhari hai
 Making a point of his so-called weaknesses, a foreign magazine questioned his leadership skills
 ab samaajawaadee party (sapa) ko bhi rahul kii kshamta par andeh hone laga he
 As if the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was sitting in wait
 england kii patrika 'da iconmist' main buudhvaar ko ek tippanee chhapi jisamen kaha gaya he ki rahul badi jimmedaari se bachate hai kyonki unamem aisi jimmedaariyon ko nibhaane kii bhukh hi nahin he
 It has also been said in the comment that Rahul as a leader has neither shown any merit nor shown readiness for big responsibility
 raajnneetik dalon main sabase pehle sapa kii ore se is par pratikriya ai jo apeksha ke anuroop nahin thi
 The SP, which is supporting the Congress government at the Center, expressed doubts over Rahul's leadership ability and said that he remained silent in the Lok Sabha for the last two years when the country was discussing many important issues
 sapa mahasachiv mohan singh ne kolkata main samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha, 'jo bhi bhartiya raajnneeti ko samajhataa he vah yahi kahegaa ki desh jin chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa he uske maddenjar rahul gandhi main desh ke netritv kii kshamta nahin he
 Singh said that in the last two years, Rahul Gandhi remained silent in the Lok Sabha while many sensitive issues were discussed
 unhone kaha, 'gat do varshon main hamen ek bhi mauka nahin mila jab ham yah sun pate ki kai samasyaon kaa saamana kar rahe desh se jude samvedansheel masale par rahul ne sansad main apana vishleshan rakhaa ho
 When no one has heard them speaking, how can anyone say that the country is safe in their hands
 'bhaajapa ko to jaise maukey kaa intjaar tha
 He even said that the brand Rahul is not visible at all
 bhaajapa pravaktaa rajeev pratap rudi ne kaha ki mahangaai ho yaa bhrashtachar kaa mudda yaa phir koyala block aavanton par chal rahaa vivaad hamane rahul ko bolte nahin suna
 Even he did not say anything on the 2G spectrum scam in which former Telecom Minister A
K
 raja ko jail janaa padaa
 He said that the issue of allocation of coal blocks has been going on for almost a month but Rahul thought it appropriate to remain silent
 rudi ne kaha, 'koyala block aavanton kaa mudda ek maheenon se surkhiyaan ban rahaa he
 Never heard him speak about this coal gate
 isliye brands rahul najar nahin aata
 On a question asked in relation to Rahul's role in the Congress, Rudy said, "when someone is not fitting in 42 years, then how to say that in 52 years he will fit
" koi yah kaise kah saktaa
 
 congress ko hi faisla lenaa he
 "when asked what fitness he was talking about, he replied," Political, administrative and mental

 The government, which was tightened after the declaration of Black Day, sensed the anger spread among a section of the police for a few days, but now the police have decided to crush it after celebrating Black Day and proclaiming the protest

 kaamanwealth khelon kii ulti ginati shuru ho chuki he lekin taiyaariyaan he ki khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi or ye dar ab sabko sata rahaa he ki agar kaam kii raftaar yahi rahi to ye badintjami khelon ke dauraan hamaari naak na katwa de
 At the conclusion of the last Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, Hindustan promised the world that there would be a blast in Delhi
 kaamanwealth khelon kii taiyaariyon ko lekar pehle disambar 2009 kaa dedline set kiya gaya tha jise baad main badal kar march 2010 kar diya gaya
 When the work was not completed, it was again extended to June 2010
 ab 31 july kii nai antim samay seemaa ko bhi badhaakar 31 agast kar diya gaya he
 But the fact is that many stadiums are still incomplete
 sarkari let-latifi kii vajah se khelon kii taiyaarinyaa adhar main lataki hui he or aayojakon kii ghatiya planning se desh kii izzat daanv par lagi hui he
 Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium: This stadium from where the world will see the spectacular opening and the outcome of the Commonwealth Games in Delhi
 yahaan khelon kaa udghaatan or samaapan samaaroh hona he
 Also, all the important competitions of athletics have to be held here
 khelon ke do maheene pehle is stadium ke chaaro taraf bikhri nirmaan saamagree malwa munh baae sawaal kii tarah ki kya vakt rahete is sabase ahm stadium main kaam puraa ho paaegaa
 Nearly one thousand crores of rupees were burnt to renovate the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium
 shuruaati dedline ke hisaab se is stadium ko disambar 2009 main hi puraa ho janaa tha, lekin uske saat maheene baad bhi stadium main 15-20 fisadi kaam baaki he
 The story of the Commonwealth Games has been vomiting since the beginning
 taiyaariyaan bhale apane aakhri mukaam par hon magar plot ab bhi nahin badla
 The most important stadium for the Games is the one where the opening and closing ceremonies take place but the same stadium will be ready later
 yamuna sports complexdilli main hui barish ke baad yamuna sports complex kaa haal hua badahaal
 On July 12, the roof of the Yamuna Sports Complex Stadium blew up in the rain and strong storm and the wooden flooring was badly damaged by the rain
 haal ye he ki stadium kaa playing field 15 agast ke baad hi taiyaar ho paaegaa
 Meanwhile its construction cost 32
 5 karod se badhkar 100 karod ho chukaa he
 The work at Siri Fort Sports Complex: Siri Fort is also incomplete
 jab media ne is sachai ko jagajaahir karne ke iraade se yahaan ghusna chaha to media ke bheetar jane par hi pabandi laga di gai
 DDA has deployed CRPF in the stadium ahead of time, because the people are not able to see the situation inside
 is hidaayat ke saath ki media ke log andar na jane paaen
 While sitting at the gate, the DDA may have covered the inside situation, but inside it is still incomplete and the DDA officers are sweating to complete it
 yahi vajah he ki didie kaa koi bhi afasar camere par aakar baat karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Talkatora Stadium: This is the stadium about which big claims were made
 18 july ko iskaa udghaatan tak ho chukaa he lekin hakkeet ye he ki stadium main itnaa kaam baaki he ki do maheene main use puraa karne main paseene chhot jaaenge
 NDMC itself has counted 18 flaws in the work that has been completed
 masalan, bijlighar ke upar bathroom, menget kii kam oonchai vagairah lekin abtak ek bhi kami dur nahin kii gai
 While the reality is that many of these flaws are dangerous for security
 aise main sawaal sirf stadium taiyaar hone kaa nahin he
 The big question is whether these stadiums designed in a hurry will meet the safety standards
 shivaji stadiumnandaaza lagaaie ki jis stadium main abhi pavilion hi ban rahe hon, use kisi antarrashtriya khel aayojan ke liye taiyaar hone main kitna vakt lagegaa
 Common sense says that it seems impossible not to prepare it before the games
 lekin aayojakon yah daawa kar rahe hai ki stadimay main kaam tezi se chal rahaa he
 But ndmc's claim gets winded up when the same question is asked of the people making it that it will take two months more to complete and it seems impossible to complete the work in August
 khelgaumvankomanwealth game kaa wo project jis par kaam sabase pehle shuru hua tha lekin dhai saal baad bhi vahaan kaaphi kaam baaki he
 Alam is that the flats will be ready in some way for the players to stay, but God is the owner of the practice venue
 technical staff ke rahane ke liye banaaya ja rahaa staff quarter kaa to abhi adhuraa hi bana he
 The deadline to complete the work here was set in March 2010
 khelgaumv ko bana rahi company ne abtak 35 main se sirf 25 tower hi didie ko saunpe hai or unamem se bhi didie ne sirf 2 hi tower fernish karke organising cameti ko die hai
 Now the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi has given a new deadline for the completion of the game village on August 1
 mumkin he ki puri takat lagaakar didie khelgaumv ke flats taiyaar kar de
 But what about the practice venue being built at the cost of 43 crore with Khelgaon, which is lagging behind the deadline
 practice venue khelgaumv kaa ahm hissaa he jisamen khilaadiyon ke liye atheletic trek, swimming pool, vetalifting or kushti ground banaae jane hai
 Apart from this, gyms, polyclinics, dining areas and religious places are also to be built for 8500 players staying in Games Village
 lekin inamen se ek bhi cheez ab tak banakar taiyaar nahin hui
 The game village means the place where the players will come first and place their bags
 bhale hi khel gaanv tab tak banakar taiyaar ho jaae lekin iske saath main ban rahen practice venue ko dekhakar to yahi lagata he ki games ke dauraan khilaadi yaho par practice karne ke bajaay apane plate kii khidki se yaho par chal rahe kaam ko hi dekh paae
 Similarly, how much is the work of beautification of the game village, the debris scattered around it is telling its story itself
 kaamanwealth staff quartersyahaan abhi aadha kaam baaki he
 The flats being built for the Commonwealth staff in Vasantkunj are also in worse condition
 chaar hazaar flats rahane laayak to dur abhi kadam rakhane laayak bhi nahin ban paaya he
 There is little expectation that the work will be completed here on time and if this happens, not only alternative arrangements will have to be made for the technical staff of Conwealth Games, but the entire plan of safety will also have to be changed
 kaamanwealth khelon kii taiyaariyon se jude kai project vakt se pichad rahe hai or yahaan kaam kaaphi jaldbaaji main kiya ja rahaa he
 Deadline has been dead since, now it is just waiting for a date on which the work of the stadium will be completed
 kyonki ab to kaam khatm hone or khel shuru hone kii tarikhon ke bich itnaa bhi faasla nahin bachaa he ki kis ek taarikh to dedline kaa naam diya ja sake
 When the Commonwealth Games were announced to be hosted, the people of Delhi hoped that in the coming years, Surat of Delhi would change
 lekin khelon ke aayojan main din ab ginati ke bache hai lekin dilli kaa cheharaa or badrang dikhaai de rahaa he
 Roads scattered all over and scattered debris
 pahadganj bana malbaganjandilli kaa pahadganj ilaaka jo hotelganj ke naam se mashhoor he
 Here in the name of projects started in the name of beautification for the Commonwealth Games, there was such a sabotage that now it is difficult to even breathe here
 saal bhar pehle shuru hue projects jaise-jaise aage bade surat sudharne kii bajaay or bigadati chali gai
 Roads, sewers, street lights all fell prey to the preparations
 ab dobaaraa wo kab banenge bhagwaan hi jaanata he
 Yes, local businessmen are definitely sharing this sequence
 karol bagah yahaan chauraahon se lekar bazaar kii galiyaan tak sab khudi padi he
 In Karol Bagh, 22 roads and 7 lanes were to be repaired at a cost of Rs 50 crore, but by June 17, 2010, only 14 percent of the work was completed
 lekin ab yani ek maheene baad hi dilli ke meyar prithviraj saahani ko jane koun sa jaadui chiraag haath lag gaya ki 90 pratishat tak kaam puraa hone kaa daawa kar rahe he
 Connaughtplace: Connaught Place ie the heart of Delhi
 kaamanwealth games projectus ke tahat yahaan street liting, street scaping, subway kaa kaam shuru kiya gaya
 Although NDMC is claiming that Connaught Place will be brightened by 31 August, but there are big pits in this market of British era
 toote footpath, chaaron ore failaa malbe ko dekhakar ye vishwaas kar paanaa mushkil he
 There are projects of Commonwealth Games or Birbal khichdi, which are not ready to cook
 saal-dedh saal se chal rahe in projectus kaa abhi ye haal he to kahana mushkil he ki is nai dedline tak bhi ye puure ho paaenge yaa nahi
 Yes, if Aladdin's lamp gets hit by the government, then perhaps Delhi can be weakened by rubbing it
 lekin sawaal sirf chamakaane kaa nahin he
 There is also the troubles that come with that glow
 planning jiskaa koi nidaan nahin sochaa gayapani kaa ikattha honasiessi kii vaigyanik sushmita kaa kahana he ki aane vaale dinon main water loging kii samasya bad jaaegi

 If you also believe that after the implementation of GST (goods and Services Tax), doing business will become as easy as breathing and you will get rid of rising inflation through leveled taxes, then once you have got the central government model GST law Must read, which will be the basis of GST and which will be tried to be approved in the upcoming session of Parliament
 kar sudhaar ke teen maksadaham jaanate hai ki sarkaar ke kanoon katai pathneey nahin hote
 But it is necessary to study this law despite the difficulty and the layers
 ise padhakar hi yah pataa chal sakegaa ki is kanoon se nikalne vaala jiesti bharat kaa sabase bada tex sudhaar nahin balki badi musiibat banane ke khataron se las he
 Coming into the GST law, it is important to remember that this tax reform has three objectives: First, there are dozens of taxes across the country which are the biggest hurdles in making India a common market
 jiesti se puure desh main utpaadan, bikri or sevaaon par samaan dar se ek tex lagegaa or bharat ek nirbaadh bazaar main badal jayega
 Secondly, while taxes increase inflation, under GST, all indirect taxes (excise, service, VAT, octroi, etc
) of the Center and States will be clubbed together, in addition to customs duty, which will reduce the effective rate of tax
 iske tahat nirmaataa or seva pradaataaon ko, utpaadan or seva ke alag staron par lagane vaale tex waapas honge jisase antim utpaada yaa seva par sirf ek tex lagegaa or mahangaai kam hogi
 Third, GST will bring in a smooth tax administration in which doing business will become very easy
 kaarobaariyon kii sabase badi saanstinhin teen vajahon se jiesti ko lekar ummiido kaa suchakank hameshaa aasmaan par chadha rahaa
 But if any person affected by these expectations reads the GST law, then he will continue to seek modern tax system and ease of doing business in it
 jiesti saboot he ki sarkarein jo kah rahi hai, kanoon uskaa thik ulataa karne vaala he
 It contains not one but many such provisions which instead of giving a forward-looking and modern tax structure, can only push the existing tax system back many years
 baangi ke liye tex panjikaran ko hi len jo ki taxeshan kaa buniyadi pahalu he or kaarobaariyon kii sabase badi saansat he
 If this law comes into force, dozens of tax registrations will have to be done
 jiesti ke prastaavit teen stareey tex (central, state, integrated) dhaanche ke tahat puure desh main maal bechney yaa supplai karne waalon ko har rajya main teen alag-alag panjikaran karaane honge or alag-alag ritern bharte hue tex kaa hisaab rakhana hoga
 How will GST make business easier? Not only that, if a company does many types of business, then all businesses will have separate registration
 ab yah sarkaar hi bataa sakati he ki asankhya registrationon or ritern kii vyavastha ke baad jiesti kaarobaar ko kaise aasaan karegaa? hakeekat yah he ki jiesti main panjikaran kaa yahi akelaa praavdhaan is puure sudhaar ko patari se utaar degaa kyonki bharat main kar niyamon ke paalan kii laagat (compliance cost) pehle hi kaaphi oonchi he, jo jiesti ke baad kai guna bad sakati he
 Another provision is Kabilegaur which will outweigh companies or establishments operating in different states in the country
 jiesti act ke tahat agar koi company apni hi kisi shakha yaa ikai ko maal yaa seva bhejti he to is par tex lagegaa
 The entity receiving the goods or services will later claim the refund of this tax
 yah praavdhaan jiesti se desh main kaaman market banane kii ummiido ko bhaavbheene shradhanjali he
 The biggest roadside tax credit in the way of GST benefits is the GST, under which the tax paid on raw materials or services during production or supply is refunded
 yahi vyavastha ek utpaadan yaa seva par baar-baar tex kaa asar khatm karti he par isse judaa praavdhaan anokhaa he
 The GST Act states that if the supplier has not paid the tax to the government, the manufacturer using that service or raw material will not be able to claim the tax credit
 yah praavdhaan jiesti ke milane vaale phaaydon kii raah main sabase bada roda hoga
 Due to complex definitions and provisions in excise and service tax laws, the Supreme Court, High Court, Tribunals and Appeal Commissioners have 1
 20 lakh se zyada mukademe lambit hai
 The GST law also has an abundance of inconsistencies and helical definitions that will increase legal complications and allow arbitrary notices to be sent
 sarkaar jo bhi daawa kare, jiesti ke model act ko padhate hue yah samajhnaa mushkil nahin ki adhikariyon ne jiesti kanoon ko puraane custom, exise, services or waite kanoonon kii asangatiyon kaa pulinda bana diya he
 The expectation was that a modern, easy and far-sighted tax system would be available through GST
 is kanoon ko dekhne ke baad jiesti main kaarobaari sahajata kii ummiden kinare lag gai hai
 The point is that the consolidated tax structure will not include stamp duty in the three-tier GST, nor is the motor vehicle tax and in some states even taxation is suspected
 petrol-dijal par lagane vaala tex jiesti ke atirikt hoga
 The rate of GST has to remain high due to recession, declining revenue of states and increased expenses due to Pay Commission
 indirect tex kii ausat dar is samay 24 fisadi he, ise dekhte hue jiesti rate 18 se 20 fisadi ke bich rah saktaa he jiskaa matlab he ki sarvice tex kii dar main chaar se chah fisadi kaa ijapha hoga or kai staron par utpaada shulk waite bhi badhegaa
 Economics, implementation and administration are important not GST politics
 krantikari sudhaar dikhaane ko baichaiyn sarkaar ko isse chaahe jo rajnatik ummiden hon lekin jiesti jis tarah aakaar le rahaa he, vah aarthik avasaron ke bajaae puure tex system main asangatiyon or araajaktaa ke raste khol saktaa he
 Hopefully our leaders will not 'kill me bull' with such a sensitive reform

 Despite this, in this community, the SP was not taking the name of anger in opposition to the government
 thakuron ke gusse kii ek badi vajah sarkaar main mantri pad sanbhaalane vaale thakur netaaon ko ek-ek karke mahatvaheen pad saunpna bhi he
 Before Raja Bhaiya was removed from the ministerial post, an important prison-like deal was snatched from him and given to sp's state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary
 iske alaava raja aridaman singh ko parihavan vibhaag ke cabinet mantri se khiskaa kar stamp evam duty jaisaa mahatvaheen vibhaag thama diya or isi tarah ek or cabinet mantri omprakash singh kaa vibhaag halkaa kiye jane ke baad se sapa se thakur matadaata naaraaz chal rahe the
 BJP spokesperson Chandra Mohan Singh says that SP has resorted to Raja Bhaiya to heal Thakurs in the riots in western districts, which is of no use
 singh kehete hai ‘raja bhaiya ko mantrimandal main shaamil karke sapa ne ek baar phir yah sabit kar diya ki is sarkaar main daagiyon ko har tarah kaa sangrakshan milegaa
 On the other hand, despite the inclusion of Raja Bhaiya in the cabinet, the sp's problems have not reduced
 shuukravaar ko raja bhaiya ke shapath grahan se ek din pehle kaisarganj seat se sapa ke loksabhaa sadsy brijabhooshan singh ne sapa pratyaashee ke taur par aglaa loksabhaa chunaav ladgaye se manaa kar diya he
 This sudden decision of Brij Bhushan, who has made a significant inroads in the Thakur fraternity in Purvanchal, may lead the SP
 brijabhooshan ne 1991 or 1999 main bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ladaa tha or ummid lagaai ja rahi he ki vah bijepi main lautne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 a leader close to Brij Bhushan says that Brij Bhushan may be fielded from Gonda parliamentary constituency in front of Union Steel Minister Beni Prasad Verma when he returns to BJP
 haalanki sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kisi bhi netaa ke sapa se saath chhodie kii ashanka ko darkinar karte hai
 Chaudhary says' sp's base is growing steadily
 agar koi netaa kisi baat par naakhush he to use manaa liya jayega
 ' maalegaanv blast cese main ek purv sarkari vakil ne bijepi netaa pragna thakur ko yah daawa karne ke liye fatkaar lagaai ki unhen 26 / 11 ke hero hemanth karkare kii aguwai vaali team dwaara jaanch ke dauraan pratadit kiya gaya tha
 Two days ago, Malegaon blast accused Pragya Thakur made a controversial statement regarding police officer Hemant Karkare, who was killed in the firing of terrorists during the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks
 pragna thakur ne kaha ki unhone shahid karkare ko shaap diya tha, jisaki vajah se unki maut ho gai
 Pragya Thakur said that 'hemant Karkare was anti-national
 vah dharm ke viruddh (dharm-virdohi) the
 You will not believe it, but i said that 'you will have an apocalypse'
 iske turant baad, aatankwaadiyon ne unhen goli maar di
 However, Pragya retracted his derogatory remarks later after criticizing her statement and amid criticism
 pragna thakur ne maalegaanv blast cese kii jaanch ke dauraan police par kai baar gambhir atyaachaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Please tell that 6 people died in the Malegaon blast
 bataa den ki pragna thakur bijepi kii tikat par bhopal se loksabhaa chunaav lard rahi hai
 In this case, the former government lawyer Rohini Salyan clarified that the court found no evidence to torture or keep Pragya Thakur in illegal custody
 maine kabhi suna nahin ki ek sadhvi ne shaap diya or koi shaks mar gaya
 These comments (against Hemant Karkare) are inappropriate and thoughtless
 mujhe lagata he ki vah prachaar ke liye aisa kar rahi hai kyonki vah chunaav lard rahi hai
 Such unwanted comments are lousy
 purv vakil salian ne point out kiya ki court ne pragna thakur ke maamle main yatnaa yaa avaidh hiraasat kaa koi saboot nahin paaya tha
 Therefore, he (the accused) challenged the verdict in the High Court which had all the records including the medical report, but even after that his petition was dismissed
 purv vakil rohinee saalyan ne bhaajapa ke is aarope ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki uske bhopal ke ummidavaar sadhvi pragna ko pichhali congress sarkaar ne fansaaya tha
 He said that both the accused were last seen with Pragya Thakur in Bhopal, there is also evidence of this
 sadhvi pragna kaa vaahan (ek scooter) usee parisar main padaa hua tha, jahaan ve rah rahe the
 Finally, this scooter was taken to the site of the blast and used there
 sarkari vakil ne kaha ki unhone 2015 main is maamle se khud ko alag kar liya, kyonki rashtriya jaanch agency ne un par is cese ko soft karneka dabaav daalana shuru kar diya tha
 Until then, i was free to fulfill my legal duties in court
 haalanki, aisi paristhitiyon main kaam karnaa mushkil tha
 Salian said that she was the last person to meet Hemant Karkare on the day of the terrorist attacks
 unhone kaha ki main aaj keval ek uddeshy ke liye bol rahi hum, kyonki main vir police adhikariyon ko badnaam nahin hone de sakati

 The industry has also expressed displeasure over Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, accused in the Malegaon bomb blast case and BJP candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat, calling Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, a patriot
 udyogpati anand mahindra ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki mahatma gandhi kii viraasat hamaare liye 'pavitra' he or use nuksaan pahunchane kaa prayaas taliban dwaara afghanistan main murtiyon todane ke krity jaisaa he
 Mahindra made the remark in a tweet amid controversy over BJP candidate Pragya Thakur's mention of Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, as a patriot in the Bhopal seat
 For 75 yrs,india’s been the land of the Mahatma;a beacon when the world lost its morality
 We used to be pitied for being poor but we were always rich since Bapu inspired billions globally
 Some things must remain sacred
 Or we become the Taliban, destroying statues that sustain us— anand mahindra (@anandmahindra) May 17, 2019 The industrialist who spoke out loudly said, India has been the land of the Mahatma for 75 years
 vah ek mashaal kii tarah hai
 When the world lost its morality, we were pushed into poverty, but even then we were rich because we had Bapu
 unhone duniya bhar main arabon logon ko prerit kiya
 Without naming Pragya or referencing his statement, Anand Mahindra said that some things should always be kept holy
 varanaa ham, prerit karne vaali yaa bharosa dene vaali murtiyon ko tabah karte hue ek din taliban ban jaaenge
 This tweet was retweeted over 8 thousand times in a few hours
 niti ayog ke siio amitabh kaant ne bhi ise ritvit kiya
 Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that Pragya has apologized, but i will not be able to forgive her from my heart
 modi ne ek channel ko die intervyuu main kaha, mahatma gandhi ke bare main yaa godse par jo bhi baaten kii gayi
 Thus all the statements made are very bad, especially hateful, worthy of criticism
 sabhy samaaj ke andar is prakaar kii bhashaa nahin chalati
 This type of thinking cannot work
 isliye aisa karne waalon ko sau baar aage sochna padegaa
 Modi said, second he (pragya) apologized, it is a different matter
 lekin main apane man se maaf nahin kar paaungaa
 Significantly, Pragya, who is doing a road show in Agar Malwa in support of BJP candidate Mahendra Solanki for the May 19 election on Dewas Lok Sabha seat, told the local news channel on Thursday in response to a question, 'nathuram Godse was a patriot , Are and will remain
 godse ko aatanki bolne vaale khud ke girebaan main jhaank kar dekhen
 This time, those who speak like this will be answered in the election

 The reason why i respect & love this man is bc of his humbleness Lunar eclipse is a special event in both astronomy and astrology, although there are many myths about eclipses
 logon ke man main aaj bhi yah ek dar he ki chandragrahan ko nangi ankhon se dekhne par nuksaan ho saktaa he
 Eyesight may be reduced or may be completely defective
 27 july 2018 ko is sadi kaa sabase lanbaa chandragrahan pad rahaa he jise dekhne ko lekar kai logon ke man main utsukata bhi he or dar bhi
 David Reineke of the Mid North Coast Astronomy says that it will be a beautiful celestial event and no one should miss it
 unhone bataaya, chandragrahan surya grahan se alag he or ise nangi ankhon se dekhnaa bilkul surakshit hota he
 There is also no need for any kind of protective filters to see it, you just have to use your two eyes to see it, but avoid seeing any kind of bright light
 aapako bataa den ki surya grahan ke dauraan solar radiation se ankhon ke najuk tissue damege ho jate he, jis vajah se dekhne main dikkat ho sakati he
 It is also called retinal sunburn
 ye pareshaani kuch vakt yaa phir hameshaa ke liye bhi ho sakati he
 But this does not happen during a lunar eclipse
 is din chand ko khuli ankhon se dekhne se koi nuksaan nahin hota
 You can see the moon by going to an open field or a park nearby
 gurugram main trephic niyamon kaa ulanghan karne vaale logon ko jaagruk karne ke liye rakshabandhan ke maukey pargurugram pulicene ek muhim ko shuru kiya he
 Under this, if any person is found to be in violation of the traffic rules, the women police personnel will make them aware of the rules
 gurugram kii smart police ne trephic niyamon ko todane waalon ko sabak sikhaane or unhen trephic niyamon ke prati jaagruk karne ke liye yah prayaas shuru kiya he
 It has been started on the occasion of Rakshabandhan to make people aware who usually violate traffic rules and not only increase the risk for themselves, but also cause trouble for other people
 aise hi logon ko maansik taur par trephic niyamon ke prati jaagruk karne ke liye ab gurugram police kii taraf se mahila police karmi aise logon ko raakhi baandhengi
 Will teach them the lesson of traffic rules
 gurugrampulice isse pehle bhi pichley saal is muhim ko chalaa chuki he
 In which similarly rakhi was tied to those who did not follow the traffic rules
 is baar bhi isi tarah gurugram ke kai chowk chauraahon par jahaan log adhikansh trephic niyamon kaa ulanghan karte hai unke upar nakel kasne or unhen jaagruk karne ke liye is muhim ko ravivaar tak chaalaaya jaayegaa
 Gurugram police is running many such campaigns on traffic
 vahiin iskaa mukhya uddeshy yahi he ki log trephic niyamon ke prati jaagruk hon or unka ulanghan nahin karen
 Such efforts have a great impact on people mentally, that is why the police have prepared this plan
 kareeb ek saal tak shant rahane ke baad kim jong un ne nayaa saal aate hi phir se zahreele bol bolne shuru kar die hai
 The North Korean dictator has once again warned the US that it will forget its promises if the restrictions imposed on its country are not lifted
 or aman kaa rasta chhodkar phir se hathiyaaron kii hode main jute jayega or agar aisa hua to korian peninsula main halaat phir vaise hi ban jaaenge jaise ek saal pehle the
 That is, the threat of nuclear war will start looming again on the world
 abhi thik se nayaa saal shuru bhi nahin hua auki marshall kim jong un apane puraane farm main aa gaya he
 For the whole year of 2018, this person had great patience for his anger in explaining the world
 magar magar calendar badalte hi isane apane tevar bhi badal liye hai
 Now once again, North Korea's Marshal Kim Jong Un has started threatening America
 duniya ko laga 12 june 2018 kii is mulaakaat ke baad marshall kim jong un badal jayega
 And now he will not endanger his country because of his whims or ego
 magar raat gai baat gai kii tarz par in tamaam atakalon ko kim ne saal kii shuruuaat hote hi apane juuton tale kuchal daalaa
 And on the new year, it has again threatened US President Donald Trump
 or saaf alphaz main kah diya he ki korian peninsula main aman ke liye use jitani koshish kerani chahie thi
 In the year 2018, he did all that
 aaj bhi wo america se baat karne ko taiyaar hai
 But America has betrayed him
 or agar usne apana ravaiyya or rukh nahin badla to mushkil hogi
 North Korea's Head of State Kim Jong Un said "I am ever ready to negotiate with the US President and agree to make every effort to produce acceptable results by the international community
" lekin agar america duniya ke saamne kiye apane vaadon ko puraa nahin kiya or hamaare desh ke khilaaf pratibandh or dabaav badhaata rahaa
 So we will have no choice but to find a new way to protect our sovereignty and interests
 "uttar korian netaa kim jong-un ne dhamkee di he ki agar america pratibandh ke jariye dabaav bananaa jari rakhata he to pyongyang apana rukh badalane par vichaar kar saktaa he
 Nuclear and ballistic missile weapons programs are subject to several sanctions on North Korea from the UN Security Council
 jisase paidaa hue vishwayuddh ke khatre ke baad uttar korian netaa ne america raashtrapati donald trump ke saath singapore main 12 june 2018 main mulaakaat kii thi
 While the nuclear disarmament agreement of the Korean Peninsula was signed, it has stalled due to the ongoing debate between Washington and Pyongyang over its true meaning
 america ne dabaav banaaya tha ki north korea ko apane parmaanu hathiyaaron ko nasht karnaa chahie
 After which North Korea also took many steps in this direction
 jisaki puri duniya main tarif hui thi
 But after America's slow stance, Kim has said that we are still ready to take the decision of our own free will
 agar america lagaataar dabaav banaata rahaa to isamen kisi tarah kii deree nahin hogi
 Not only this, Kim Jong-un also threatened to end the joint military exercise between the US and South Korea
 kim ne kaha he ki america ko ab saajha sainya abhyaas band kar dena chahie
 Because North Korea has also improved its relations with South Korea
 vah donon deshon ke bich kai summit bhi kar chuke hai

 Mayawati tweeted three on Tuesday morning
 unhone pehla twit kiya, ‘rajasthan main congress party kii sarkaar ne ek baar phir basapa ke vidhayakon ko todakar gaiyr-bharosemand evam dhokheybaaj party hone kaa pramaan diya he
 This is a betrayal of the BSP movement which has been repeated when the BSP was giving unconditional support to the Congress government from outside
 basapa netaa ne apane duusare twit main kaha, ‘congress apni katu virdohi party / sanghathanon se ladane ke bajaae har jagah un partiyon ko hi sadaa aghat pahunchane kaa kaam karti he jo unhen sahyog / samarthan dete hai
 The Congress is thus an anti-sc, ST and OBC party and has never been sincere and honest about the right to reservation of these classes
 '2
 Instead of fighting with its bitter party / organizations, the Congress always acts to shock those parties which support / support them
 congress is prakaar essi, asti,obisi virdohi party he tathaa in virgon ke aarakshan ke haq ke prati kabhi gambhir va eemaandaar nahin rahi he

 congress hameshaa hi baba sahib da bhimrao ambedkar va unki maanavtaavaadi vichaardhaara kii virdohi rahi
 For this reason, Dr
 Ambedkar had to resign as the first law minister of the country
 congress ne unhen na to kabhi loksabhaa main chunakar jane diya or na hi bharataratna se sammanit kiya
 Very sad and embarrassing
 iske baad ek anya twit kiya, ‘congress hameshaa hi baba sahib dow
 Bhimrao was opposed to Ambedkar and his humanitarian ideology
 isi kaaran dow
 Ambedkar had to resign as the first law minister of the country
 congress ne unhen na to kabhi loksabhaa main chunakar jane diya or na hi bharataratna se sammanit kiya
 Very sad and embarrassing

 The Rajasthan assembly speaker told PTI in Jaipur late night that BSP mlas met him and handed over a letter to him
 vasudev kolhatkar ne bataaya ki ve science ke teacher rahe hai or bacchon ke liye yahaan lab banaaya he, taaki ve skool ke baad yahaan aakar abhyaas kar saken
 But my mind was hanging on the board, which was written on Kirtan Shala
 is board par kai prakaar ke kirtanon kaa zikr tha
 Scientific Kirtan, Rashtriya Kirtan, Brahma Nirupak Kirtan, Bhagwat Week Statement, Discourse Purana Statement and Science Fiction
 ghar ke baahar do or board lage the
 One was written on the Math Temple and on the other was the Science Temple
 kirthan or vigyaan kaa ek hi ghar dekhakar chaunkna to banataa tha, varna patrkaar kis liye bane hai
 Kolhatkar sir starts telling his story and i start writing for you
 'mere pitaaji vasudev kolhatkar kirtankaar the
 i am following their tradition
 maharashtra main kirthan kii parampara bahut puraani he or uttar bharat yaa shesh bharat se bilkul alag
 Kirtan in the rest of India only consists of poetry in style, but Marathi contains kirtan in both poetry and prose styles
 sant namdev, sant gyaneshwar, sant tukaraam ne kirthan kii ek viraat parampara kii buniyaad rakhi, jisamen bhakthi bhav hota tha
 These are called Varkari Kirtans
 ek doosraa kirthan or he
 Naradaiyya Kirtan
 naarad ne kirthan kii ek alag hi parampara kii buniyaad rakhi
 In which knowledge was knowledge and knowledge of the four sutras
 dharm, arth, kaam or moksh
 Science was also used in Naradiya Kirtan
 ' kolhatkar sahab ne baad main yah sab jaankaree mujhe email ke zariye bhi di taaki main or vistaar se samaj sakuun
 Kirtan has two parts
 purv rang or uttar rang
 Kolhtkar saheb says that it is our responsibility to connect the old tradition with the needs of today
 isliye main kirthan ke purv rang main pehle atom, time, gurutvkarshan ke bare main bhi bataata hum
 Then in the second part i also sing about Rishi Gautama, Sage Kanad, Maitreyi, Einstein, Galileo, Kepler, Michael Faraday and Newton
 kolhatkar sahab ne hamen marathi gadhy style main newton kii katha gakkar sunai
 Understood the language but understood with a sense that they are adding religion and science, saying that Newton was very religious
 itnaa hi nahin ve newton kii jivan lila or khoj kii tasviir bhi khinchne lagate hai
 Explains how the incident that happened in his life was related to religion
 in paatro kaa zikr isliye karte hai taaki purv rang main samay, gurutvkarshan ke samarthan main kathaon ke zarie logon ko jaagruk kiya ja sake
 Kolhtkar sir makes science of Kirtan quite interesting with a sense of devotion, knowledge science, humor and satire
 mujhe bataaya ki zyaadaatar kirthan ve mandir main karte hai
 Science comes to the devotees coming to the temple
 1980 ke dashak se ve is prakaar ke kirthan kaa pradarshan kar rahe hai
 The very quiet nature and the consumption of lesser things, Kolhatkar Sahib's lifestyle also looked like a saint
 kolhatkar sahab ne kaha ki kirthan ke saath anginat vishyon ko joda ja saktaa he
 But most are limited to devotion only
 maine vaigyanik kirthan kii raah chuni he
 i also narrate the story of Bhaskaracharya and Aryabhata and also of Archmidies
 abhi vigyaan kirthan kii jaankaree se man bhar hi rahaa tha ki unki mez par ek puraani kitaab dikhi
 Abraham Katha was written on the front page
 ab meri jigyaasa dasvin manzil par ja chuki thi
 Kolhtkar sahab told that this is a Jewish kirtan and Anna Schultz of Stanford University is doing research on it
 ana kii ek kitaab bhi ai he, jiskaa naam he Singing a Hindu Nation (2004) ana bhi apane shodh ke dauraan abraham katha se aise hi achaanak takaraa gayi
 i have heard his video lecture, which he has given at Stanford University
 is lacture ko sunanaa chahie
 The struggle of Jewish identity through music in the Marathi tradition is amazing
 maine usee lacture se abraham katha kaa saar liya he jo aapke liye sankshep main likh rahaa hum
 The tradition of Hindu Kirtan in Maharashtra is very old
 bombai ke marathi yahudee jinhen ben israeli kaha jaataa he yahaan ke hindu samaaj ke bich apni pahchaan kaa rasta khoj rahe the
 He was looking for a way to show it
 ek din manzagaanvkar or unke teen saathi hindu kirtankaar raav sahab shankar pandurang pandit kii kirthan sabha se laut rahe the
 Rao Sahib's influence was so great that these three decided to start the tradition of Jewish Kirtan and in 1880 established the Kirtan Stimulus Board
 vahaan se yah parampara marathi yahudee logon ke saath isroyal tak kii yatra kar chuki he
 Ana Shultz told that the saga of the flow of Jewish kirtan from the kirtan sung in Hindu temples originates from many crises of identity visits
 tab bhartiya yahudee british isaayiyon se or rashtriya andolan main apni pahchaan ke liye sangharsh kar rahe the
 Initially, a lot of vigilance was taken to adopt the style of other religions, but the feeling of Hindu Kirtan was fully realized
 is baat ke baavjood ki mishnariyon ne jab marathi main likhe abraham katha ke geeton kaa anuwaad kiya to bhartiya vaadya yantron ke naam kii jagah paashchaatya vaadya yantron ke naam likh die
 Jewish women tried to show in front of Hindu neighbors and women through these kirtans that we are no less Indians
 isai mishnariyon ne marathi yahudee ko apni taraf prabhavit karne ke liye bibal kaa marathi main anuwaad bhi kiya magar baat tab bhi nahin bani
 Jewish kirtans went on to become part of their local lives and identities
 1880 main jab pehali baar yahudee kirthan gaaya gaya to iskaa yahudee samudaay ne kaaphi swaagat kiya
 Their only concern was that our own culture should not end
 iske liye manzagaanvkar ne saat niyam banaae
 Just like Hindu Kirtanakars do not worship Lord Vitthal, do not touch the feet and do not give donations etc
 in niyamon ke baad bhi yahudee kirthan gayaki style main kirthan style ke khaanche ke bheetar hi bandhaa rahaa
 In a way, the stream of indo-israeli music began to be born
 1880 se lekar 1990 ke bich 35 bene ben israeli kirthan geeton kaa prakaashan hua
 The character of Abraham is sung in the Indian musical style
 aaj bhi hota he
 i have written all this information from Ana Shultz's video lecture
 in jaankariyon ko kai log kai tareeke se istamaal kar sakate hai par satya yahi he ki ateet main dharaaen dharm or pahchaan kii seemaa se takaraate hue bhi aar-paar hoti raheen or ek viraat samskruti kaa janm hota rahaa
 It would be good to recognize these stories of the present past as countless creators of culture

 Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party is ready to change the face of politics in the country's capital
 janata ke saamne cabinet kii baithak, ramlila maidan main dilli vidhansabha ke vishesh satr, kharch tay karne ke liye masik mohalla sabhaayen jaisi kai chijen dilli pehali baar dekhegi
 What the leaders had called 'a fool's dream' some time ago is now going to become a reality
 somvaar ko aam aadmi party ne dilli main sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 Arvind Kejriwal will be the Chief Minister
 india today se khaas baatcheet main unhone kaha ki vah revolutionari yani 'krantikari' mukhyamantri bananaa chaahate hai jo apane siddhanton se samjhauta nahin karegaa
 He said, 'there is a belief in the country that you make agreements to stay in power
 log sochate hai ki kursi par rahete hue krantikari hona naammumkin he
 i do not agree with this
 sardaar patel or laal bahadur shastri bahut practical netaa the, par satta main rahete hue bhi ve krantikari the
 'to be a constructive CM, not destructive' Kejriwal's hands also say that being revolutional does not mean 'destructive' means everything is going to break
 unhone kaha, 'main mishanri utsaah se kaam karnaa chahta hum par iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki meri approach distroctive rahegi
 i want to work constructively with the people of Delhi
 mukhyamantri ke liye sabase jaruri he logon kii seva kaa bhav
 If injustice is happening in the area then the Chief Minister should feel pain
 agar janata ke dard se use dard nahin hota to vah bas file hi clear karata rah jayega
 "what went on the moon was the common man" and the Congress and senior BJP leaders are challenging Kejriwal to fulfill his big promises
 donon partiyon ke netaaon ko yakeen he ki aam aadmi party dilli main prabhaavshaalee sarkaar nahin chalaa sakegi or loksabhaa chunaavon tak uski kalai khul jaaegi
 But Kejriwal, who has proved the political stalwarts wrong before, seems confident on this front too
 unhone kaha, 'sarkaar chalaanaa koi badi baat nahin he
 No Chief Minister is born
 har kisi kaa pehla anubhav hota he
 Politicians should not think that the common man of the country is weak
 is desh kaa aam aadmi khaanaa bananaa, kapade pahananaa or ghar bananaa jaanata he
 The man who went to the moon was the common man
 aam aadmi ab sarkaar chalaakar bhi dikhayega
 "many experts will advise us" Kejriwal admitted that his mlas are non-experienced but argued that lack of experience in running the government does not mean that we will not be able to run the government
 unhone kaha, 'shiksha mantri banane se pehle arvinder lavali ne shiksha ke kshetra main kya kiya tha? rajkumaar chouhan food ministar the
 What did he do in his area before becoming a minister? We will form an honest government
 kai export hai jo sarkaar ko suzav de sakate hai

 They know that whatever they have to do, they will have to do it in a very short time because after March, the Code of Conduct will come into force in view of the Lok Sabha elections

 These officials also made many suggestions to Kejriwal on their behalf
 'sari budhimaani hamaare hi paas nahin he'aam aadmi party kii sarkaar 'swaraj' kii avadharana par khadi hogi
 Kejriwal believes that going public will bring a revolutionary change in politics
 unhone kaha, 'hamen faisle lene kii prakriya main janata ko shaamil karnaa hoga
 Only then things will improve
 agar band kamare main baithe chaar log ye daawa karenge ki unke paas sari chizon ke jawaab hai to kuch nahin thik hoga

 kejariwal kehete hai, 'pehle log vidhayak ke paas jane ke liye daud-bhaag karte the, ab vidhayak janata ke bich khud jaaenge
 People need to take just one day out of the month for the government
 mohalla sabha ilaake ke kisi park main hogi, jahaan log aaenge or bataaenge ki unke ilaake main koun sa kaam karavaaya janaa chahie
 The work that the majority favors will be the same
 thekedaaron ko tab tak pement nahin kii jaaegi, jab tak sthaneey log khud kaam kii gunvattta nahin jaanch lete
 "I am afraid of the huge expectations of the people" The responsibility is going to increase even more on Kejriwal's shoulders
 vah kehete hai, 'kai baar to main dar jaataa hum ki logon ko mujhase kitni ummiden hai
 i do not know if we will succeed in running the government
 main ishwar se prarthana karata hum ki ham safal hon
 But our fate is not under our control
 haalanki hamaara kaam hamaare vash main he
 We pray to God to give us courage and dedication that we can live up to the expectations of the people
 ''ishwar par yakeen laut aayaa he'arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki aakhri kuch maheenon main ishwar main unka vishwaas laut aayaa he
 He told, 'I come from a very religious family
 lekin iaiti khadgpur main padhai ke dauraan meraa ravaiya vaigyanik ho gaya or main naastik ho gaya

 Defense Minister AK Antony revealed in Parliament on Tuesday that he had asked Army Chief General VK Singh to take action in the matter of bribing him Rs 14 crore in a defense deal but he did not want to pursue the matter
 unhone kaha ki sena pramukh ne na to is maamle ko aage badhaayaa or na hi baad main koi likhit shikaayat kii
 Antony made this disclosure in his statement in the Rajya Sabha on the claim made in an interview with the Army Chief published yesterday in an English daily
 unhone kaha ki kareeb ek saal pehle unki sena pramukh general ve ke singh se mulaakaat kii thi
 According to the defense minister, Singh told him, "A retired general Tejendar Singh met me and told me about the offer of Rs 14 crore
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘ main stabdh rah gaya
 It took me a minute or two to get back to normal
 ’’ unhone kaha ‘‘maine unase karrwai ke liye kaha
 But he said that he does not want to pursue the matter
 ’’ raksha mantri ne kaha ‘‘vah mujhe likhit shikaayat kar sakate the lekin unhone koi likhit shikaayat nahin kii
 He said that yesterday when he saw the interview of the military chief in a newspaper, he told the Secretary of Defense that the matter was serious and it should be investigated by the CBI
 antni ne kaha ki kal unhen loksabhaa main sawaalon ke jawaab dene the, isliye vah raksha sachiv se baatcheet kar sansad aa gaye
 After returning from Parliament, he gave written orders for a comprehensive CBI inquiry into the facts of the report published in the newspaper
 raksha mantri ne sadan ko aashwaasan diya ki jaanch main doshi paae jane par kisi bhi vyakti ko bakhsha nahin jayega bhale hi vah kitna hi prabhaavshaalee kyon nahin ho
 He said, in this case i have tried to make better decisions on my part
 yadi maine koi galati kii he to aap sajaa de sakate hai
 The Defense Minister said at the outset of his statement that he came to public life in 1958 through student politics
 uske baad se abhi tak unhone saarvajanik jivan main shuchita or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf muhim ko sarvaadhik ahmiyat di he
 He has been Chief Minister of Kerala thrice and Union Minister once before
 pichhali baar unhone kendriya mantri pad se istipha diya tha to sabhi sansad sadsy unhen aisa nahin karne kii salaah de rahe the
 But he did not listen to anyone
 antni ne kaha ki is baar bhi jab unhen raksha mantri banane kii baat aayi to vah shuru main hichkichaae
 But the party leadership asked him to take over the ministry as the ministry remains in dispute due to defense deals
 antni ne kaha ki unhone raksha mantri kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad sainik netritv se mulaakaat kii or yah spasht kar diya ki vah aadhunikeekaran ke paksh main hai lekin bhrashtachar ko tanik bhi bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 He said that if the point of corruption proved at any stage of defense procurement, the entire deal would be canceled
 unhone kaha ki vah har shikaayat ko gambhirtha se lete hai or use raksha mantralay ke jariye sena ke paas bhej dete hai taaki aaropon kaa pataa lagaakar jarurat ke anusaar karrwai kii ja sake
 He said that he also does not ignore anonymous complaints
 antni ne kaha ki unhone adarsh bhoomi ghotaale sahit vibhinn maamalon main sibiai jaanch ke aadesh die
 Never before has a CBI inquiry been ordered in so many cases
 inhen jaanchon kaa nateeja he ki chaar videshi sahit chah companiyon ko das saal ke liye kaali suchi main daalaa gaya he
 He said that he is accused of delaying defense deals
 unhone kaha ki bhale hi vilamb ho lekin bhrashtachar ko kisi bhi keemat par sahan nahin kiya jayega
 The Defense Minister said that he regularly meets the heads of the three armies and this meeting is done separately
 in mulakaaton main sainya pramukh taaja paristhitiyon se unhen avgat karaate rahete hai or apni samasyaayein bataate hai
 Defense Minister Antony said that India is becoming a big market for defense equipment and companies from various countries including Russia, USA, Israel, Germany, UK, France want to take contracts here
 ek theka kisi company ko milane par anya companiyaan shikaayat karti hai
 But the ministry does not ignore any complaints
 antni ne kaha ki pichley saal hamane raksha kharid bajet kaa 100 pratishat kharch kiya tha
 He also said that he is also considering fixing the defense deal processing mechanism
 vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne raksha mantri se spashtikaran maangate hue kaha ki pichley kuch samay se sena or raksha mantralay ke jo maamle saamne aa rahe hai, ve pareshaan karne vaale hai
 He said that these cases should have been settled behind closed doors
 unhone kaha ki aisa lagata he ki sarkaar ne kai maamalon main ankhen munde rakhin
 The comments jetali ne kaha ki jab sainya pramukh ko yah maaloom tha to unhone karrwai kyon nahin kii
 bjp's SS Ahluwalia wanted to know from the government what is the scope of investigation in the orders given by the CBI probe in this case
 makapa ke tii ke rangarajan ne jaananaa chaha ki jab raksha mantri ko maamle ke bare main ek saal pehle hi pataa chal gaya tha to unhone ise gambhirtha se kyon nahin liya or usee samay jaanch ke aadesh kyon nahin die gaye
 He said that the army chief neither pursued the matter nor later made any written complaint
 antni ne ek angreji dainik main kal prakashit sena pramukh ke saakshaatkaar main kiye gaye daawey par apni ore se rajyasabha main die gaye bayaan main yah khulaasa kiya
 He said that about a year ago his army chief met General VK Singh
 raksha mantri ke anusaar singh ne unase kaha, ‘‘ek sevanivrutt general tejendar singh ne mujhase mulaakaat kii or mujhe 14 karod rupaye kii peshkash ke bare main bataaya
 "he said," i was shocked
 mujhe saamaanya hone main ek do minute lage
 "he said" i asked him to take action
 lekin unhone kaha ki vah is maamle ko aage badhanaa nahin chaahate
 "the Defense Minister said" he could have made a written complaint to me but he had not made any written complaint
 ’’ unhone kaha ki kal jab unhone ek akhbaar main sainya pramukh kaa saakshaatkaar dekha to unhone raksha sachiv se kaha ki yah maamla gambhir he or isaki sibiai se jaanch karaayi jaae
 Antony said that he had to answer questions in the Lok Sabha yesterday, so he came to Parliament after talking to the Secretary of Defense
 sansad se lautne ke baad unhone akhbaar main chhapi report ke tathyon kii vyapak sibiai jaanch ke likhit aadesh die
 The Defense Minister assured the House that no person would be spared if found guilty in the investigation, no matter how influential
 unhone kaha, is maamle main maine apni ore se behatar nirnay karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 If i have made a mistake, you can punish
 raksha mantri ne apane bayaan ke shuru main kaha ki vah 1958 main chaatr raajnneeti ke madhyam se saarvajanik jivan main aae
 Since then, he has given the most importance to the campaign against purity and corruption in public life
 vah teen baar kerala ke mukhyamantri or isse pehle ek baar kendriya mantri rah chuke hai
 Last time he resigned as Union Minister, all the Members of Parliament were advising him not to do so
 lekin unhone kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Antony said that even this time when it came to make him the defense minister, he initially hesitated
 lekin party netritv ne unase yah mantralay sanbhaalane ko kaha ki kyonki yah mantralay raksha saudon ke kaaran vivaadon main rahata he
 Antony said he met the military leadership after assuming the post of defense minister and made it clear that he was in favor of modernization but corruption would not be tolerated even at all
 unhone kaha ki raksha kharid ke kisi bhi charan main yadi bhrashtachar kii baat sabit huyi to puure saude ko radd kar diya jayega
 He said that he takes every complaint seriously and sends it to the army through the Ministry of Defense so that the allegations can be traced and action taken as per the need
 unhone kaha ki vah gumnaam shikayaton kii bhi andekhi nahin karte
 Antony said that he ordered a CBI inquiry in various cases including the Adarsh land scam
 isse pehle kabhi itane maamalon main sibiai jaanch ke aadesh nahin die gaye
 The result of these investigations is that six companies, including four foreigners, have been blacklisted for ten years
 unhone kaha ki un par aarope lagata he ki vah raksha saundon main vilamb karte hai
 He said that even if there is delay, corruption will not be tolerated at any cost
 raksha mantri ne kaha ki vah niyamit taur par teenon senaaon ke pramukhon se milte hai or yah mulaakaat alag alag kii jaati he
 In these meetings, the army chief keeps them informed of the current situation and explains their problems
 raksha mantri antni ne kaha ki bharat raksha upkarnon kaa ek bada bazaar ban rahaa he or rus, america, israel, germany, britain, france sahit vibhinn deshon kii companiyaan yahaan theke lenaa chaahati hai
 Other companies complain when a contract is awarded to a company
 lekin mantralay kisi bhi shikaayat kii andekhi nahin karata
 Antony said that last year we spent 100 percent of the defense procurement budget
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki vah raksha sauda prakriya tantra ko durust karne par bhi vichaar kar rahe hai
 Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley, seeking clarification from the Defense Minister, said that the cases of the Army and the Ministry of Defense, which have been coming up for some time, are disturbing
 unhone kaha ki in maamalon ko band daravaajon ke peeche hi sulajhaa liya janaa chahie tha
 He said that it seems that the government has turned a blind eye to many cases
 tippaniyan Jaitley said when the army chief knew this, why did he not take action
 bhaajapa ke hi es es ahaluwalia ne sarkaar se jaananaa chaha ki is maamle main sibiai jaanch ke jo aadesh die gaye hai unamem jaanch kaa dayera kya he
 TK Rangarajan of the CPI (M) wanted to know why the defense minister did not take it seriously when he came to know about the case a year ago and why the inquiry was not ordered at the same time
 antni ne ek angreji dainik main kal prakashit sena pramukh ke saakshaatkaar main kiye gaye daawey par apni ore se rajyasabha main die gaye bayaan main yah khulaasa kiya

 Where i got a government offer to write a dialogue for a film

 You should have content, he said, 'whatever the film is, just keep in mind that you should have something to say

 It has to be kept in mind whether you are emotional or not? Actually the sentiment has a great impact on the article

 Regarding the writing of the film, Chaturvedi said, 'never be pressured to write
 apane idia or lekhak ke bich ek relation hota he
 It happens with your mind
 ' apane bare main unhone bataaya ki wo kabhi film likhte hue sinopsis nahin likhti hai or ek pattern par kabhi bhi riting nahin karti
 He told, 'the story has to be kept simple
 jis tarah ek daadi-nani ek simple tareeke se kahani bataati hai, vaise hi kahaniyaan bataai jaati he
 She cried while writing Piku, she said, 'bhaskar died while writing Piku, so i wrote that he was dead
 uske baad piku upar aati he or nabj dekhi

 He should impress himself
 He told about writing writing that unless the writing does not affect you, then understand that it will not affect anyone
 koi bhi lekhan se aapako hansi yaa ronaa aana chahie
 But many times do not write for themselves and write for others

 For this, you have to get it selected on the basis of your story and the old films of the director

 tippaniyan Far from being afraid, the child starts laughing loudly and asks her father to stunt the plane again
 ye kahana galat nahin hoga ki ye ladki udne ke liye hi paidaa hui he

 While Pakistan does not seem ready for reconciliation on the issue of Kulbhushan Jadhav, on the other hand questions are arising as to what will be the next step of his family to save Jadhav? The legal way is the only fodder? In the opinion of diplomacy experts Jadhav's family has the only hope of appeal against the punishment-a-death
 sena ke tribunal main faisle ko chunauti dene ke alaava parivaar ke sadsy pakistani sena ke adhyaksh or vahaan ke raashtrapati ke saamne dayaa yachika daayar kar sakate hai

 What is the attitude of Pakistan? Pakistan's army and government have taken a strong stand on the issue of Jadhav
 bharat ne bhi saaf kiya he ki is masale kaa asar donon deshon ke tallukaat par padana tay he
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's foreign affairs adviser Sartaj Aziz had said that Jadhav could file an appeal in the army tribunal within 40 days
 unke paas pakistan ke senadhyaksh ke paas dayaa yachika daayar karne ke liye 2 maheene kaa vakt he
 According to Aziz, the last way for Jadhav is to plead with the Pakistani President

 loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 or 35 e hataane kaa vaada kiya tha
 On Wednesday, when mps Prabhat Jha, Chhaya Verma, Sukhram Singh Yadav and Vishambhar Prasad Nishad questioned this in the House
 sarkaar kii ore se jawaab diya gaya lekin is jawaab se sarkaar kaa is masale par rukh spasht nahin hota he
 The answer given by the Ministry of Home Affairs did not say yes and it was not denied
 darasal, saansadon ne poocha tha ki sarkaar kaa anuchhed 370 or 35 e par kya rukh he
 What strategy has the government devised to eradicate terrorism
 bijepi saansad prabhaat jha ne rajyasabha main poocha - kya anuchhed 370 jammu-kashmir ko vishesh darja detaa he
 For all other functions except defense, foreign and financial matters, does the Center have to take the approval of the state government
 kya anuchhed 370 jammu-kashmir ke vikaas main baadhak he
 If it is also a threat to the unity and integrity of the country, is the government considering removing it
 is par grih rajya mantri ji kishan reddy ne jawaab diya
 He said that Article 370 is a temporary system, which is mentioned in Part 21 of the temporary, transitional and special provisions in the Indian Constitution
 vahiin anuchhed 35 ek ko lekar bataaya ki raashtrapati ke 1954 main jari aadesh se ise samvidhan main darj kiya gaya
 The Minister of State for Home said that due to special status, the President issues the order after consulting the state government
 haalanki anuchhed 370 ko hataane or na haatane ko lekar sarkaar ne kuch spasht jawaab nahin diya
 Let me tell you that earlier mps Asaduddin Owaisi and Ajay Kumar had questioned the news of delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir
 poocha tha ki kya sarkaar jammu-kashmir main kshetreey asantulan ko samaapt karne ke liye rajya main parisemen sambandhi kaary par vichaar kar rahi he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs also did not give a clear answer
 grih mantri ji kishan reddy ne sarkaar ke rukh ke bare main jaankaree dene kii jagah sirf itnaa kaha tha ki jammu-kashmir rajya ko parisemen adhinium, 2002 ke kshetradhikaar main shaamil nahin kiya gaya, kyonki rajya vidhansabhaon ke nirvachan kshetron ke parisemen sambandhi bharat ke samvidhan ke anuchhed 170 ko jammu-kashmir par lagu nahin kiya gaya he
 Legislative assembly constituencies in the state of Jammu and Kashmir are delimited under sections 47 and 141 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir
 grih rajya mantri ne bataaya tha ki maujuuda samay main jammu divijan main 37,33,111 voter or kashmir divijan main 40,10,971 voter hai
 The Supreme Court has allowed passive euthanasia
 ise pasive yuthenesia bhi kaha jaataa he
 Now those patients, who are suffering from the disease which can never be cured and are living their lives in severe pain
 unhen sammaan ke saath apana jivan khatm karne kii anumati de di gai he
 But can anyone get euthanasia? Let's know everything about passive or passive euthanasia
 supreme court main chif justise of india deepak mishra kii aguwai vaali paanch jajon kii sanvaidhanik bench ne 'niskriy ichhamrityu' or 'living vil' ko kuch sharton ke saath anumati de di he
 The court said in its remarks that the dying person will have the right to take the last breath
 court ne kaha ki logon ko sammaan se marane kaa puraa haq he
 Living will is a written document in which a patient instructs in advance what kind of treatment to be given when they reach a moribund condition or are unable to give consent
 pasive yuthenesia (ichhamrityu) vah sthiti he jab kisi maranasann vyakti ke jeevanarakshak saport ko roak athwa band kar diya jaay
 However, on the will of 'living Will', some people have feared that it can also be misused
 ichhamrityu par supreme court kii tippanee-1
 An adult person who is struggling with a disease that can never be cured
 beemaari kii vajah se ghor pidaa main jivan kaat rahaa he or jiske swasth hone kii koi aas nahin bachi he
 If he asks for euthanasia in writing, his family or doctor will be allowed to stop or stop his treatment
 isamen dawaai, dialasis or ventilation jaise jeevanarakshak saport ko roak dene yaa band kar dene kii anumati he
 2
 'living vil' ke liye kisi aisi laailaaj or peedaadaayak beemaari se jujh rahe vyakti ko ek medical panel ke samaksh ichhamrityu kii arji deni hogi
 The panelists on 'living Will' will first take full information and then seek opinion from the victim's family
 iske baad peedit ko kuch samay tak 'kooling period' main rakhaa jayega
 Only after which the application will reach the court
 pasive or active ichhamrityu main kya antar he?kisi laailaaj or peedaadaayak beemaari se jujh rahe vyakti ko niskriy rup se ichhamrityu di jaaegi
 This means that the victim's life-saving measures (medication, dialysis, and ventilation) will be discontinued or stopped
 peedit swayan mrityu ko praapt hoga
 Active euthanasia means giving death to a victim by injection or some other means
 supreme court ne pasive ichhamrityu kii anumati di he, active kii nahin
 In which diseases the Supreme Court has given permission for euthanasia? Supreme Court has not mentioned any such specific disease
 agar doctors ko lagata he ki peedit ke swasth hone kii koi aas nahin bachi he to uske parivaar waalon se salaah karke niskriy ichhamrityu di ja sakati he
 Even if the patient is able to understand the thinking completely, will the decision be made by the family only? aisi avasthaa main nirnay lene kaa adhikaar puri tarah peedit kaa hoga
 Passive euthanasia will be painful? It is entirely the responsibility of the doctors not to allow the pain of the patient to increase further

 rajya main kahin par thane kii building par bhagava rang chadh gaya he, to kahin sabji mandi or gud mandi ko bhagava rang main rang diya gaya he
 Not only this, after the recently held municipal elections, the color of the bjp-occupied municipalities has also started to become saffron
 thane ko bhagava rang se rangabijanour ke afjalgarh thane ko puri tarah se bhagava rang se rang diya gaya he
 Only the police board on the police station has remained in the police color, otherwise the entire police station building has been painted with saffron color

 "when someone says ‘beauty’, i picture the icons of beauty
 People like Audrey Hepburn or Smita Patil come to mind
 For me, it has a lot to do with personality
 There were a lot of pretty women in cinema around Audrey Hepburn's time, but she stood out because she had a very interesting personality — which went beyond her looks
 She did so much for women, for animal rights, for children’s education—it’s always the personality that comes through and makes one seem beautiful

 Efforts are being made to incite hatred in Maharashtra once again
 shivasena ne duusare rajyon se aakar rah rahe logon ko maharashtra chhodane kaa ultimatum de diya he
 Fasaad started in Kolhapur last night
 khud ko emenes kaa kaaryakarta bataane vaale logon ne paraprantiyon par jamkar kahar barapaaya
 People who came to earn livelihood from other states were dragged from their homes and beaten
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki utpaati saream gundgardee karte rahe or koi pulisavaala unhen rokane tak nahin aayaa
 The Shiv Sena workers also took to the streets with Lashkar Lashkar on hearing the atmosphere and heard the orders of the emissaries to leave Maharashtra
 kolhapur main paraprantiyon ke khilaaf hue hangaame ke peeche do saal kii bacchee ke saath balaatkaar ko vajah bataaya ja rahaa he
 According to the case, according to the rape, a youth named Rajesh Singh, a resident of Jharkhand, lured the girl and raped her
 bacchee kii haalat is kadar bighad gai ki use aspataal main bhartee karana padaa
 The police arrested the accused Rajesh, but MNS and Shiv Sena men created a ruckus by pretending to be the same case
 is chakkar main baahar se aae un logon ko bhi buree tarah peeta gaya jinka koi kasoor nahin tha
 What collective punishment can be given to the people of the society involved in any incident? Can not be given but we have made a formula
 balaatkaar kaa aaropee kisi khaas mazahab kaa he to us mazahab ke khilaaf tarah tarah ke whatsap material ban jate hai
 When the rumor of child theft spreads, a crowd is formed
 gau maance ko lekar to bas afvaah failaa dijie, bheed ban jaaegi
 If you do a post-mortem of each mob, the enemy will get one, but in the name of forging different enemies, a crowd is formed
 kabhi bhashaa to kabhi rajya ke naam par
 If the police had been strict towards such a crowd from the beginning, they would not have got much encouragement if they were not standing on the shore
 haalat yah ho gai ki supreme court ko disha nirdesh jari karnaa pad gaya ki daroga str se lekar dijipi str tak ke police adhikariyon ko kya karnaa hoga
 The Supreme Court can ask for a report from Gujarat and see how effective its guidelines are on the ground
 vaise gujarat ke saat zilon main halaat pichley do dinon se kaabo main hai
 But before that, why did the situation deteriorate so much that the workers of Bihar UP had to leave
 police harakat main aa gai he
 Night patrolling has been increased
 sibar cell soshal media par nazar rakh rahaa he
 The police have arrested 450 people, 35 firs have been done and Gujarat Home Minister Pradeep Singh Jadeja has appealed to those who have left the state to return
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri se bhi is bare main baat kii he
 Different numbers of how many people have fled are in the media in Gujarat
 kitne log rajya chhod kar gaye hai isaki koi nishchit sankhya nahin he
 Different media have different numbers
 ahmedabad mirar main ek uttar bhartiya sanghathan ke netaa ke hawaale se chapa he ki 50,000 log gujarat chhod kar chale gaye
 The Sandesh newspaper has written that 20,000 people have left
 ahmedabad-botad bhaskar ne likhaa he ki ahmedabad se 2000 log gaye hai
 Gujarat News has written that 1800 people have gone from Mehsana and Patan
 ab inamen se koun diwali ke liye gaya he or koun dehshat ke kaaran bataanaa mushkil he
 We are not even giving numbers on our behalf
 un aath das dinon main kya hua jiske kaaran itani badi sankhya main logon ko rajya chhodana padaa, kya hinsa itani bhayaavah thi
 After all, no matter how valid the words of the people who spread violence, no matter how correct they are, can they be allowed to take law in this way
 ahmedabad ke stesan or bas stop par rajya chhod kar jane vaale logon se media ab baat kar rahaa he to pataa chal rahaa he ki vahaan kya hua tha, ye log kyon dare hue hai
 On Sunday, the report of the Idian Express has written that people have left for Bihar UP after filling up buses from Ahmedabad
 tees-tees ghante kii yatra aasaan nahin hoti he
 The people who landed at the railway station from Darbhaga to Banaras have told their grief
 yahaan tak ki bihar upi se aae logon ke aadhaar card check kiye gayi hai ki ve bahari hai yaa nahin kyonki kuch log vahaan rahete rahete gujarati bolnaa sikh gaye the
 Many such videos also reached us in which people are talking about leaving the laborers in such houses and leaving them within 24 hours
 soshal media main aane vaale aise video ko bahut dhyaan se dekhne kii zarurat he
 Neither seeing them is misguided nor is it a part of the crowd
 pehle police ne kaha ki log tyoharon ke kaaran rajya chhod kar ja rahe hai magar duusari taraf pahunche mazaduron ne kuch or hi bataaya
 There is a village near the town of Himatnagar in Sabarkantha district of Gujarat
 28 sitambar ko yahaan ek bacchee ke saath balaatkaar hua
 The accused is said to be from Bihar
 police ne is aaropee ko turant giraftaar kar liya tha
 But the anger of the people hurt by the rape incident gradually increased against the migrant laborers
 unke saath marpet kii ghatnaayen bhi saamne ai hai
 Violence has occurred in Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, Patan, Sabarkantha and Mehsana districts
 yahaan par halaat ab kaabo main hai
 All political parties have condemned the incident
 congress netaa alpesh thakor kaa naam aayaa tha ki unka koi video messej he jisamen hinsa ko bhadakaane kii baat kahi gai he magar abhi tak police ke record se aisi baat saamne nahin ai he or na hi police ne alpesh thakor ke khilaaf koi maamla darj kiya he
 There is a video of Alpesh in which he is appealing for peace, saying that his society is being maligned on the pretext of violence
 lekin gujarat police ne aaj ek aise netaa ko giraftaar kiya he jinhone video massej main hinsak baaten kii hai
 This leader has been arrested as a Congress leader who has won the taluka election
 iskaa naam mahotji thakor he jo ek video main pravasi mazaduron ko chhod kar chale jane kii dhamkee de rahe hai
 The victims of the attack have been those who work in the factory
 sabarkantha main ek coton factory par hamalaa kar mazaduron ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 Shailesh Patwari of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said that 70-80 percent of the workers are from outside, the impact of their going out of business
 naroda industry sangh ne kaha he ki mazaduron ko factory campus main hi rukne kaa intazaam kiya ja rahaa he
 In many places factory owners have met with the workers, they have been assured
 shailesh patawaari ne kaha ki diwali ke samay yah nahin hona chahie tha
 He said that on October 7 and 8, the salary is distributed
 industry ke log koshish kar rahe hai ki selary lene ke baad koi rajya se baahar nahin jaae varna diwali ke samay iskaa kaarobaar par bada asar padegaa
 The secretary of the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce says, "so the atmosphere that exists now is of panic
" lekin sarkaar ne achche kadam uthaae hai
 The police have meetings with the workers
 aashwaasan die hai
 i understand that trust is being built
 jo chale gaye unhen waapas laane main ek maheenaa lag jayega
 May be no more workers
 naroda main baahar ke varkar ke factory ke andar hi rahane kaa intazaam kar denge
 70-80 workers are non-living
 hamaare karigar log ye kaam nahin kar sakate hai
 No matter how much raw material we will have, but if there is no artisan then the factory is not going to run
 isliye karigar ko nikaalnaa gujarat ke industry ke liye bahut kharaab hoga
 Any party doing this is destroying the country
 inako maaf nahin karne vaala he
 Gujaratis should get an option but you know that people of Gujarat cannot do such labor
 unke blad main lebar karne kii aadat kam he
 Will do business but will not carry the bag on his shoulder
 yah samajhnaa padegaa or maananaa bhi padegaa
 ' shailesh patawaari ne jo baat kahi he us par gaur karnaa chahie
 Industry cannot run without the workers of Bihar UP
 in rajyon ke mazaduron ne apane saste or umdaa shram kii badaulat kai duusare rajyon ko samrudh kiya he
 Therefore, when someone has committed a crime, it is not right for him to target the whole community
 khaskar tab jab police ne balaatkaari ko pakad liya he
 The panic that lasted for ten days should have been overcome immediately
 ab to supreme court kii guideline he ki bheed banane se pehle uski har soochna par ection lenaa he or bheed ko haaavee nahin hone dena he
 The Supreme Court can take it as a test case of how much work has been done on its model in Gujarat
 aapse bhi apil he ki vahaan se aa rahi khabaron ko zyaada badha chadha kar pesh na karen
 It is in everyone's good that mutual trust is built and people return to work
 ek video aayaa he jo mumbai kaa he
 Which is telling that no one has the copyright to break up as a mob
 thane main maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke logon ne ek shaks ko thane main dene ke bajaae media ko bulaayaa or camaron ke saamne maarna shuru kar diya
 According to him, he was doing obscene acts with a child
 agar pakadaa gaya to kanoon ke paas paryaapt adhikaar hai ection lene ke, kanoon ke hawaale kar dena tha magar chaar logon kii yah toli court main badal gai
 The district president of MNS immediately saw and understood the entire UP Bihar's hand in it
 kya bheed sirf gujarat or maharashtra main banati he, hakeekat yah he ki wo kahin bhi ban sakati he
 In Bihar itself, there was a mob against the girls of Bihar
 uskaa kya karenge
 Look at him emotionally
 supaul zile ke ek gaanv ke log hi ladakiyon ke skool main lathi lekar ghus gaye or unhen maarane peetane lage
 Hit so much that the girls had to be hospitalized
 is skool main 100 chatraayen padhati hai
 It was common to seduce schoolgirls
 chaatraon ke skool ke saamne chaatro kaa bhi ek skool he
 The boys used to write abuses on the wall of their school, which got disputed
 jiske agle din ladakon ke parivaar or gaanv vaale aae or ladakiyon par tut pade
 He was badly hit by sticks, bricks and rods
 inamen se zyaadaatar 12 se 14 saal kii chatraayen hai
 Women were also included in the violent mob
 police ne 9 logon ko namjad kiya he
 Some people have also been arrested
 kya yah bhayaavah nahin he ki chhedhkhani kaa virodh karne par gaanv ke log hi ladakiyon par tut pade
 How frightening it must have been for them
 kya isi tarah se bheed gujarat main nahin ban gai hogi, kya isi tarah kii bheed maharashtra main nahin ban gai hogi
 The comments ek bheed news channel vaale banaate hai
 Ever since the channels have been handed over to the Hindu Muslim National Syllabus, they have become uncontrollable
 kisi maamle main muslim aaropee ho yaa musalmaan shaamil ho bas dekhie soshal media par kaisaa tufaan machataa he
 Then the same fire rains on the channels
 quint bevesite kii ek report ne media ko aaina dikhaaya he
 On October 1, Ankit Kumar Garg of Jahangirpuri, Delhi was killed
 ankit kii ek muslim ladki se dosti thi
 Alt News has told how the news channels and website of the channels wrote whether Ankit Garg was punished for being a Hindu
 chunki iske pehle ek or ankit kii hatya ho chuki thi to kuch ne likhaa ki kitne ankit maare jaaenge
 Those who reported responsibly also left the religion angle questioning them
 alt news ke arjuna siddharth kii is report ko dekhenge to aap saham jaaenge ki aapkaa media dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaane ke liye kya kuch kar saktaa he
 When such reporting burns the city, who does not get caught in the fire
 ab jaakar pataa chalaa he ki ankit garg kii hatya honor keeling nahin thi
 Akash is arrested in the case of Ankit's murder, who did not like friendship with Ankit and his friend
 hindu muslim angel aate hi soshal media par jane pahachaane log hawa dene lage the
 Will the media institutes delete the news of Ankit Garg from their website, the reporting institution has collapsed so much that the channels or newspapers are no longer able to report even in Delhi
 ankit kii bahan ke bayaan ke hawaale se dharm kaa angel aayaa tha magar media ne hedline aise lagaai jo unke bayaan ko kuch or matlab detaa tha
 Alt News has questioned all of us
 alt news kii is report ko har news room main phir se padhaa janaa chahie varna jo media khud bheed banaata ho vah gujarat or bihar kii bheed par kaise sawaal uthayega
 There is no definite number of how many people have left the state
 alag alag media main alag-alag sankhya he
 a North Indian organization leader in the Ahmedabad Mirror was quoted as saying that 50,000 people left Gujarat
 sandesh akhbaar ne likhaa he ki 20,000 log chhod kar chale gaye hai
 ahmedabad-botad Bhaskar has written that 2000 people have left from Ahmedabad
 gujarat samachar ne likhaa he ki mehsana or patan se 1800 log gaye hai
 Now who among these has gone for Diwali and who is scared it is difficult to tell
 sankhya bhi ham apni taraf se nahin bataa rahe hai
 What happened in those eight ten days that caused such a large number of people to leave the state, was the violence so horrific
 aakhir hinsa failaane vaale logon kii baaten kitni bhi jaays hon, unki baat kitni bhi sahi ho, kya unhen is tarah se kanoon haath main lene diya ja saktaa he
 The media is now talking to people leaving the state at Ahmedabad's station and bus stop, then it is being known that what happened there, why are these people scared
 idian express kii ravivaar ko report likhi he ki ahmedabad se bason main bhar bhar kar bihar upi ke liye log ravaanaa hue hai
 a journey of thirty hours is not easy
 darambhaga se lekar banaras ke railway stesan par utre logon ne apni vyathaa bataai he
 Even the Aadhar cards of people coming from Bihar UP have been checked whether they are outsiders or not because some people had learned to speak Gujarati while living there
 aise kai video ham tak bhi pahunche the jisamen log vaise gharon main jaakar mazaduron ko 24 ghante ke bheetar chhod kar chale jane kii baat kar rahe hai
 Such videos coming in social media need to be watched very carefully
 na to inhen dekhakar bahekaave main aana he or na hi bheed kaa hissaa bananaa he
 At first the police said that people are leaving the state due to festivals, but the workers who reached the other side told something else
 gujarat ke sabarkantha zile ke himmatnagar shahar ke paas ek gaanv he
 a girl was raped here on 28 September
 aaropee bihar kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 The accused was immediately arrested by the police
 lekin balaatkaar kii ghatana se aahat logon kaa gussa dhire-dhire pravasi mazaduron ke khilaaf badhane laga
 Incidents of assault have also come to light with him
 gandhinagar, ahmedabad, patan, sabarkantha or mehsana zilon main hinsa hui he
 The situation here is now under control
 sabhi raajnneetik dalon ne is ghatana kii ninda kii he
 Congress leader Alpesh Thakor's name came up that he has a video message that has been said to incite violence, but till now such a record has not been revealed from the police records nor the police has registered any case against Alpesh Thakor
 is
 alpesh kaa ek video zarur he jisamen ve shanti kii apil kar rahe hai or kah rahe hai ki hinsa ke bahaane unke samaaj ko badnaam kiya ja rahaa he
 But today the Gujarat Police has arrested a leader who has spoken violently in video messages
 is netaa ko congress kaa ek netaa bataakar giraftaar kiya gaya he jo taluka kaa chunaav jeet chukaa he
 Its name is Mahotji Thakor in a video threatening to leave migrant laborers
 hamale kaa shikaar wo log hue hai jo factory main mazaduri karte he
 Workers were targeted by attacking a cotton factory in Sabarkantha
 gujarat chembar of kamrs and idstry ke shailesh patawaari ne kaha he ki 70-80 pratishat mazdoor baahar ke hai, inke jane kaa asar kaam dhandhe par pad rahaa he
 Naroda Industry Association has said that the workers are being arranged to stay in the factory campus itself
 kai jagahon par factory maalikon ne mazaduron ke saath meeting kii he, unhen bharosa dilaayaa gaya he
 Shailesh Patwari said that it should not have happened at the time of Diwali
 unhone kaha ki saat or aath aktubar ko selary bantati he
 The people of the industry are trying not to go out of the state after taking salary or else it will have a big impact on the business during Diwali
 gujarat chember of commers ke secretary kehete hai, 'isliye abhi kaa jo maahaul he dehshat kaa he
 But the government has taken good steps
 police ne kamgaaron ke saath meeting kii hai
 Have given assurances
 main samajhataa hum ki bharosa ban rahaa he
 It will take a month to bring back those who have gone
 shaayad ab or kaamgaar naa jaaen
 In Naroda, we will make arrangements to stay inside the outside worker factory
 70-80 varkar gaiyr guzaraati hai
 Our artisans cannot do this work
 hamaare paas kaccha maal kitna bhi hoga lekin karigar nahin hoga to factory nahin chalane vaali he
 Therefore, removing the artisan would be very bad for the Gujarat industry
 koi bhi party kar rahaa he wo desh kaa ahit kar rahaa he
 He is not going to forgive them
 gujarati ko vikalp milanaa chahie lekin aap jaanate hai ki gujarat ke log aise lebar nahin kar sakate hai
 They have less habit of labor in their blood
 dhandha kar legaa lekin bag kandhe par uthaakar nahin le jayega
 It has to be understood and will have to be accepted
 ' It should be noted that what Shailesh Patwari has said
 bihar upi ke mazaduron ke bina industry nahin chal sakati he
 The workers of these states have enriched many other states due to their cheap and excellent labor
 isliye jab kisi ne aparaadh kiya ho, to uske liye puure samudaay ko nishaanaa bananaa thik nahin
 Especially when the police have caught the rapist
 das din tak jo dehshat kaa maahaul rahaa, us par turant hi kaabo paa liya janaa chahie tha
 Now the guideline of the Supreme Court is that action has to be taken on every information before the crowd is formed and the crowd is not allowed to dominate
 supreme court ise test cese ke rup main le saktaa he ki gujarat main uske banaae model par kitna kaam hua he
 You are also appealed not to exaggerate the news coming from there
 sabaki bhalaai isi main he ki aapasi vishwaas bane or log kaam par lauten
 a video has come from Mumbai
 jo bataa rahaa he ki bheed ban kar tut padane kaa copirite ab kisi ek ke paas nahin he
 In Thane, the people of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena called the media and started beating in front of the cameras instead of giving a person to the police station
 inke anusaar yah ek bacchee ke saath ashleel harakatein kar rahaa tha
 If caught, the law has enough rights to take action, it had to be handed over to the law, but this group of four people turned into court
 emenes ke zila adhyaksh ne turant isamen puure upi bihar kaa haath dekh liya or samaj liya
 Whether the crowd is formed only in Gujarat and Maharashtra, the reality is that it can be made anywhere
 bihar main hi bihar kii ladakiyon ke khilaaf ek bheed ban gai
 What will he do? use kis bhavukta se dekhen
 People from a village in Supaul district entered the girls' school with sticks and started beating them
 itnaa maaraa ki ladakiyon ko aspataal main bhartee karnaa pad gaya
 This school has 100 students
 skool kii chaatraon ke saath chhedhkhani aam ho gai thi
 There is also a school of students in front of the girls' school
 ladke apane skool kii diwaar par apshabd likh diya karte the jise lekar vivaad ho gaya
 The next day, the families of the boys and the villagers came and attacked the girls
 laathiyon, eenton or rods se buree tarah maaraa gaya
 Most of them are girls aged between 12 and 14 years
 hinsak bheed main mahilaayein bhi shaamil thim
 The police have named 9 people
 kuch logon kii giraftaar bhi ho chuki he
 Isn't it frightening that the village people cracked down on girls for opposing molestation
 unke liye yah manzar kitna khaufnak rahaa hoga
 Would not the crowd have been formed in Gujarat in the same way, would it not have been formed in Maharashtra
 tippaniyan a crowd makes news channels
 jab se channelon ko hindu muslim neshnal silebus thamaya gaya he ve bekaabu ho chale hai
 Whether a Muslim accused or a Muslim is involved in a case, just look at the storm on social media
 phir vahi aag channelon par barasati he
 a report by the Quint website showed the media a mirror
 1 aktubar ko dilli ke jahangirpuri ke ankit kumaar garg kii hatya hui thi
 Ankit was befriended by a Muslim girl
 alt news bataaya he ki kaise news channel or channelon ke website ne likhaa ki kya ankit garg ko hindu hone kii sazaa di gai
 Since another Ankit had been killed before this, some wrote how many Ankit would be killed
 jinhone jimmedaari se reporting kii unhone bhi dharm ke angel ko prashnvachak lagaakar chhod diya
 If you see this report of Arjun Siddharth of Alt News, you will be aghast that your media can do something to provoke religious sentiments
 aisi reporting se kab shahar jal jaae, koun us aag kii chapet main aa jaae pataa nahin
 It is now known that the killing of Ankit Garg was not honor killing
 ankit kii hatya ke maamle main akaash giraftaar hua he jise ankit or uski dost ke saath dosti pasand nahin thi
 Famous people started airing on social media as soon as Hindu Muslim angle came
 kya media santhaan apni website se ankit garg kii khabar dilit karenge, reporting kii sanstha itani dhwast ho gai he ki channel hon yaa akhbaar ab dilli se bhi dhang kii reporting nahin kar pate hai
 Referring to Ankit's sister's statement, there was an angle of religion, but the media put the headline in such a way that gave some more meaning to his statement
 ham sab par sawaal uthaaya he alt news ne
 This report of Alt News should be re-read in every newsroom or else the media which itself creates a crowd will question the crowd of Gujarat and Bihar
 un aath das dinon main kya hua jiske kaaran itani badi sankhya main logon ko rajya chhodana padaa, kya hinsa itani bhayaavah thi
 After all, no matter how valid the words of the people who spread violence, no matter how correct they are, can they be allowed to take law in this way
 ahmedabad ke stesan or bas stop par rajya chhod kar jane vaale logon se media ab baat kar rahaa he to pataa chal rahaa he ki vahaan kya hua tha, ye log kyon dare hue hai
 On Sunday, the report of the Idian Express has written that people have left for Bihar UP after filling up buses from Ahmedabad
 tees-tees ghante kii yatra aasaan nahin hoti he
 The people who landed at the railway station from Darbhaga to Banaras have told their grief
 yahaan tak ki bihar upi se aae logon ke aadhaar card check kiye gayi hai ki ve bahari hai yaa nahin kyonki kuch log vahaan rahete rahete gujarati bolnaa sikh gaye the

 agar pakadaa gaya to kanoon ke paas paryaapt adhikaar hai ection lene ke, kanoon ke hawaale kar dena tha magar chaar logon kii yah toli court main badal gai
 The district president of MNS immediately saw and understood the entire UP Bihar's hand in it

 In Bihar itself, there was a mob against the girls of Bihar

 Look at him emotionally

 Alt News has told how the news channels and website of the channels wrote whether Ankit Garg was punished for being a Hindu
 chunki iske pehle ek or ankit kii hatya ho chuki thi to kuch ne likhaa ki kitne ankit maare jaaenge
 Those who reported responsibly also left the religion angle questioning them
 alt news ke arjuna siddharth kii is report ko dekhenge to aap saham jaaenge ki aapkaa media dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaane ke liye kya kuch kar saktaa he
 When such reporting burns the city, who does not get caught in the fire

 Akash is arrested in the case of Ankit's murder, who did not like friendship with Ankit and his friend
 hindu muslim angel aate hi soshal media par jane pahachaane log hawa dene lage the
 Will the media institutes delete the news of Ankit Garg from their website, the reporting institution has collapsed so much that the channels or newspapers are no longer able to report even in Delhi

 Such videos coming in social media need to be watched very carefully
 na to inhen dekhakar bahekaave main aana he or na hi bheed kaa hissaa bananaa he
 At first the police said that people are leaving the state due to festivals, but the workers who reached the other side told something else

 Especially when the police have caught the rapist

 Whether a Muslim accused or a Muslim is involved in a case, just look at the storm on social media
 phir vahi aag channelon par barasati he
 a report by the Quint website showed the media a mirror
 1 aktubar ko dilli ke jahangirpuri ke ankit kumaar garg kii hatya hui thi
 Ankit was befriended by a Muslim girl
 alt news bataaya he ki kaise news channel or channelon ke website ne likhaa ki kya ankit garg ko hindu hone kii sazaa di gai
 Since another Ankit had been killed before this, some wrote how many Ankit would be killed
 jinhone jimmedaari se reporting kii unhone bhi dharm ke angel ko prashnvachak lagaakar chhod diya
 If you see this report of Arjun Siddharth of Alt News, you will be aghast that your media can do something to provoke religious sentiments
 aisi reporting se kab shahar jal jaae, koun us aag kii chapet main aa jaae pataa nahin
 It is now known that the killing of Ankit Garg was not honor killing
 ankit kii hatya ke maamle main akaash giraftaar hua he jise ankit or uski dost ke saath dosti pasand nahin thi
 Famous people started airing on social media as soon as Hindu Muslim angle came
 kya media santhaan apni website se ankit garg kii khabar dilit karenge, reporting kii sanstha itani dhwast ho gai he ki channel hon yaa akhbaar ab dilli se bhi dhang kii reporting nahin kar pate hai
 Referring to Ankit's sister's statement, there was an angle of religion, but the media put the headline in such a way that gave some more meaning to his statement
 ham sab par sawaal uthaaya he alt news ne
 This report of Alt News should be re-read in every newsroom or else the media which itself creates a crowd will question the crowd of Gujarat and Bihar
 shailesh patawaari ne jo baat kahi he us par gaur karnaa chahie
 Industry cannot run without the workers of Bihar UP
 in rajyon ke mazaduron ne apane saste or umdaa shram kii badaulat kai duusare rajyon ko samrudh kiya he
 Therefore, when someone has committed a crime, it is not right for him to target the whole community
 khaskar tab jab police ne balaatkaari ko pakad liya he
 The panic that lasted for ten days should have been overcome immediately
 ab to supreme court kii guideline he ki bheed banane se pehle uski har soochna par ection lenaa he or bheed ko haaavee nahin hone dena he
 The Supreme Court can take it as a test case of how much work has been done on its model in Gujarat
 aapse bhi apil he ki vahaan se aa rahi khabaron ko zyaada badha chadha kar pesh na karen
 It is in everyone's good that mutual trust is built and people return to work
 ek video aayaa he jo mumbai kaa he
 Which is telling that no one has the copyright to break up as a mob
 thane main maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke logon ne ek shaks ko thane main dene ke bajaae media ko bulaayaa or camaron ke saamne maarna shuru kar diya
 According to him, he was doing obscene acts with a child
 agar pakadaa gaya to kanoon ke paas paryaapt adhikaar hai ection lene ke, kanoon ke hawaale kar dena tha magar chaar logon kii yah toli court main badal gai
 The district president of MNS immediately saw and understood the entire UP Bihar's hand in it
 kya bheed sirf gujarat or maharashtra main banati he, hakeekat yah he ki wo kahin bhi ban sakati he
 In Bihar itself, there was a mob against the girls of Bihar
 uskaa kya karenge
 Look at him emotionally
 supaul zile ke ek gaanv ke log hi ladakiyon ke skool main lathi lekar ghus gaye or unhen maarane peetane lage
 Hit so much that the girls had to be hospitalized
 is skool main 100 chatraayen padhati hai
 It was common to seduce schoolgirls
 chaatraon ke skool ke saamne chaatro kaa bhi ek skool he
 The boys used to write abuses on the wall of their school, which got disputed
 jiske agle din ladakon ke parivaar or gaanv vaale aae or ladakiyon par tut pade
 He was badly hit by sticks, bricks and rods
 inamen se zyaadaatar 12 se 14 saal kii chatraayen hai
 Women were also included in the violent mob
 police ne 9 logon ko namjad kiya he
 Some people have also been arrested
 kya yah bhayaavah nahin he ki chhedhkhani kaa virodh karne par gaanv ke log hi ladakiyon par tut pade
 How frightening it must have been for them
 kya isi tarah se bheed gujarat main nahin ban gai hogi, kya isi tarah kii bheed maharashtra main nahin ban gai hogi
 The comments ek bheed news channel vaale banaate hai
 Ever since the channels have been handed over to the Hindu Muslim National Syllabus, they have become uncontrollable
 kisi maamle main muslim aaropee ho yaa musalmaan shaamil ho bas dekhie soshal media par kaisaa tufaan machataa he
 Then the same fire rains on the channels
 quint bevesite kii ek report ne media ko aaina dikhaaya he
 On October 1, Ankit Kumar Garg of Jahangirpuri, Delhi was killed
 ankit kii ek muslim ladki se dosti thi
 Alt News has told how the news channels and website of the channels wrote whether Ankit Garg was punished for being a Hindu
 chunki iske pehle ek or ankit kii hatya ho chuki thi to kuch ne likhaa ki kitne ankit maare jaaenge
 Those who reported responsibly also left the religion angle questioning them
 alt news ke arjuna siddharth kii is report ko dekhenge to aap saham jaaenge ki aapkaa media dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakaane ke liye kya kuch kar saktaa he
 When such reporting burns the city, who does not get caught in the fire
 ab jaakar pataa chalaa he ki ankit garg kii hatya honor keeling nahin thi
 Akash is arrested in the case of Ankit's murder, who did not like friendship with Ankit and his friend
 hindu muslim angel aate hi soshal media par jane pahachaane log hawa dene lage the
 Will the media institutes delete the news of Ankit Garg from their website, the reporting institution has collapsed so much that the channels or newspapers are no longer able to report even in Delhi
 ankit kii bahan ke bayaan ke hawaale se dharm kaa angel aayaa tha magar media ne hedline aise lagaai jo unke bayaan ko kuch or matlab detaa tha
 Alt News has questioned all of us
 alt news kii is report ko har news room main phir se padhaa janaa chahie varna jo media khud bheed banaata ho vah gujarat or bihar kii bheed par kaise sawaal uthayega
 The panic that lasted for ten days should have been overcome immediately
 ab to supreme court kii guideline he ki bheed banane se pehle uski har soochna par ection lenaa he or bheed ko haaavee nahin hone dena he
 The Supreme Court can take it as a test case of how much work has been done on its model in Gujarat
 aapse bhi apil he ki vahaan se aa rahi khabaron ko zyaada badha chadha kar pesh na karen
 It is in everyone's good that mutual trust is built and people return to work
 ek video aayaa he jo mumbai kaa he
 Which is telling that no one has the copyright to break up as a mob
 thane main maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke logon ne ek shaks ko thane main dene ke bajaae media ko bulaayaa or camaron ke saamne maarna shuru kar diya
 According to him, he was doing obscene acts with a child
 agar pakadaa gaya to kanoon ke paas paryaapt adhikaar hai ection lene ke, kanoon ke hawaale kar dena tha magar chaar logon kii yah toli court main badal gai
