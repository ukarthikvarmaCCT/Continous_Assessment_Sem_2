 After a 22-hour flight and then a series of welcome, Sakshi Malik may have had to make herself feel again and again what is happening

 With a focus on wrestling the new generation, especially the urge to shape the future of girls

 koi paanch sau rupee ke noton se bani maala pahana rahaa tha to kisi ne sau-sau rupee ke noton kii maala tham rakhi thi
 If someone had a necklace of Hazari notes, then someone was seen waiting for their turn holding a garland of 20 or 50 notes

 The biggest is the lock on the thinking that only boys increase lineage, girls are inferior to them or girls cannot fight wrestling

 Welcoming Mulayam, Shivpal said that 'netaji is a progressive socialist party and now you have to live in it

 We propose to make you national president
 is prastaav kaa shivpal kii party ke logon ne ek sur main samarthan kiya
 Shivpal said, "where there are socialists, there are leaders

 After this Shivpal talked about calling a national conference in 5 days
 shivpal ke ghar pahunche mulaayam singh yadav ne bolnaa shuru kiya to wo sapa kii tarif karne lage
 In such a situation, the voice of the activists came that it is a progressive socialist party, not a socialist party
 is par mulaayam singh bole, 'acha, ab samaajawaadee party kaa doosraa naam pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ho gaya he
 'let us know that Mulayam's arrival at Shivpal's house is considered a shock to SP President Akhilesh Yadav

 The leader's blessings are with him and will continue to be

 In the same way, sometimes they are completely silent on Shivpal, sometimes they say that all people in the Samajwadi Party are one

 Now the question is that the way in which the BJP is facing difficulties in the BJP regarding the candidature for the post of PM, it has made Modi feel that Delhi is far away

 After Gujarat, Modi, who expressly described himself as a contender for the throne of Delhi, expressly defied the question about the PM by expressing his desire to pay the country's debt

 khaali pade gharon par aane vaale dinon main tex riyaayat mil sakati he
 The direct tax panel constituted by the government has recommended that vacant houses should not be considered as deemed rental income and tax should not be recovered from them

 Will be done
 bahut jald hi kai project puure hone vaale hai or khaali pade makaanon kii sankhya or badhane vaali he
 This concession to be given to the non-income tax for builders who are facing a shortage of money will be a major relief

 Maharashtra Home Minister RR Patil has ordered an inquiry into the 'missing' bulletproof jacket of Anti Terror Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare
 grih mantri se jude ek sutara ne bataaya ‘‘patil ne jacket ke laapata hone ke mudde ko gambhirtha se liya he or aparaadh shakha ko is bare main jaanch karne ko kaha he
 Union Home Minister p Chidambaram had said that the Mumbai Police had not yet discovered the bulletproof jacket worn by Karkare during his death, which was the police's failure
 saath hi unhone is truti ke liye maafee bhi maangi thi
 Karkare was martyred while combating the terrorists near Cama Hospital on 26-11

 microsoft ne haal hi main windos10 laanch kiya jiske baad duniya bhar main karodo logon ne apane computer ko windos 10 main apgrade kar liya he
 For some people, this is proving to be a profitable deal, while there is a section across the world who is troubled by some of the shortcomings of Windows 10
 log pareshaan ho kar twitor par # windows10fail naam se hashtag chalaa rahe hai
 In which they are referring to the drawbacks of Windows 10
 pichhali kadi main hamane aapako windos 10 ke 10 damdaar fitures se rubaru karaayaa tha
 Now let us tell you what are the drawbacks in Windows 10
 1
 a plethora of paid applications: To download most useful apps in the Windows Store of Windows 10, you will have to loose pockets
 bhartiya computaron main amuman khelaa jane vaala play card game yani 'windos solitare' ke liye bhi aapako paise dene honge
 This move by Microsoft has seen a lot of resentment among the fans of this game worldwide
 log twit ke jariye apni naaraazgi jaahir kar rahe hai
 LMAO Solitaire in Windows 10 is a 'freemium' game, you've got to pay to remove ads
 Solitaire! Hahaha

 hai speed internet kii jarurat:bharat internet speed ke maamle main duniya bhar main nichle paaydaan par he
 And most features of Windows 10 require high speed internet to work well
 agar aapke paas acchhee speed vaala broadband conection naa ho to computer apadet hone main chaar se paanch din laga degaa
 Windows 10 will take hours to reopen as soon as you shut down the computer during the update
 or agar windos 10 samay par apadet naa hua to aap windos 10 ke tamaam ficharon kaa laabh bhi nahin le paaenge
 3
 tach screen or tabs ko zyada tarjeeh:windos 10 ko tach screen or tablet pisi ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya jo bina tach vaale computaron ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban jaataa he
 People have also complained of difficulty in using the new notification feature of Windows 10
 4
 Start Menu Crash Problem: Due to the presence of all the apps and features of the computer in the start menu, the start menu crashes from time to time
 5
 Firefox and Chrome browsers do not work properly: Mozilla Firefox and Chrome browsers work slow in Windows 10, as well as some features of these browsers do not work and make it difficult to work on the computer by constantly giving the message of Not Responding
 mozillaa karporation ke siio ne microsoft ko is babat par ek khulaa patr bhi likhaa he jisame unhone windos 10 main firefox ke thik se naa kaam karne kii shikaayat karte hue sudhaar karne ko kaha he
 6
 wifi connactivity kii samasya:logon ne windos 10 main wifi thik se naa conect hone kii samasya kii bhi shikaayat kii he
 7
 privesi kaa khatra:windos 10 ke kuch ficharon ko aapane dhyaan se disable nahin kiya to windos 10 aapkaa sara password, activity or lokation store karata he jiskaa durupyog havers yaa aapke dost aasaani se kar sakate hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why Microsoft has launched a bug hunting campaign for Windows 10 as well, and finding a flaw in Windows 10 will be given more money than before
 agali kadi main ham aapako bataaenge kaise sicyor karen windos 10 taaki koi naa kar sake aapaki jasusi

 The Air Quality Life Index states that the lives of people are being reduced to 9 years due to air pollution in the most populous cities of India including delhi-ncr
 agar in shaharon main pradooshan kam ho jaae, to yahaan rahane vaale logon kii jindagi 9 saal tak bad jaaegi

 mujhe lagata he ki agar aap duniya main sarvshereshth bananaa chaahate ho to aapako sabhi paristhitiyon main khelnaa siikhnaa hoga
 Waugh said that during the captaincy of the Australian team, he never paid much attention to what kind of wicket he had to play
 unhone kaha, ‘maine 57 maichon main team kii captaini kii or kabhi curator se is bare main baat nahin kii ki hamen kis tarah kii pich par khelnaa he
 Waugh, who played 168 Tests for Australia, however said that India is a strong contender for victory in the four-test series against England
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat kii team majboot he, bharat ko bharat main haraana hameshaa mushkil hota he
 Some young players are also coming forward which are good signs for Indian cricket
 (cheteshwar) pujaara ne doharaa shatak banaaya, viraat kohli acha khel rahe hai, pragyan ojha ne wicket chatkaaye, yah bhartiya cricket ke liye acha he
 Steve said, "india will win the series 3–0 because the pitches are compatible with their team
" ’ India did not expect much from the visit of US President Barack Obama
 yun to america ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii sthai sadsyta ke liye bharat ke naam par apni ore se hami bhar di he
 But China is also one of the permanent members of the Security Council
 bharat ko china ke samarthan kii bhi darkaar hogi
 On the issue of terrorism, the people of India were eager to hear more about Pakistan than Obama was willing to say about the beginning of the tour
 baad main america raashtrapati ne aatankiyon ke liye jananath sabit ho rahe pakistan ke khilaaf apekshaakrit kadaa bayaan diya
 Those who were earlier frightened to think that Obama should not make a harsh statement on Kashmir are now surprised
 yah ek aisa masalaa he, jisapar bharat kii kootnithik sthiti philhal kamjor he
 Obama did not break away from America's fixed policy at all
 america ab tak yahi maanata rahaa he ki kashmir vivaad bharat or pakistan ke bich kaa dwipaksheeya masalaa he
 At the same time, Obama has given an opinion in favor of starting negotiations between the two countries
 is masale par unhone manmohan singh ke saamne ek behtareen avasar bhi muhaiyaa kara diya he
 Manmohan's stance has been reinforced in which he has said that support and dialogue with terrorism from Pakistan's land cannot be carried out simultaneously
 kuch bhartiya companiyon par lagaae gaye pratibandh america ne waapas le liye
 This also cleared the way for the two countries to agree on dual-use technology
 obama ne khud bhi outsorcing ke bare main chal rahi bayaanbaji ko or badhaayaa
 America's complaint has been that jobs from her country are going to India
 obama khud bharat kii aisi chhavi pesh karne ko baadhya hue ki yah desh puri duniya ke liye 'vaikalpik kaarysthal' jaisaa he
 During the speech, Manmohan Singh made it clear that it is not India's job to provide recruits for America
 do mitra rashtron ke bich baari-bharkam kafile samet kiye gaye daure ke peeche apana hit saadhane kii manshaa to hoti he
 Also, it also means how to redeem the hidden power in this relationship in front of the world
 raashtrapati obama america ke hiton ko saadhane ke liye hi bharat daure par aae
 He also managed to do so
 unhone bharat ke saath 14 billian dollar ke saude par hastakshar kiye
 He claimed that he was successful in taking 72 thousand jobs to America
 unhone yah bhi rekhaankit kiya ki bharat-america sambandh ke vistaar kii aseem sambhaavnaaen maujuud hai
 This is possible not only through bilateral trade, but also at the political, strategic and public level
 vishwa ke sabase bade loktantr or sabase puraane loktantr ke bich itani pragadh mitrataa kuch zyada puraani nahin he
 However, the most important question is whether this friendship will prove to be on a level of respect and respect, or will India be expected to be a 'junior partner' to meet America's strategic need
 duusari sthiti bharat ko katai manjuur nahin hogi
 Barack Obama has also claimed that India is not a 'developing' but a 'developed' country
 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar kaa do saal kaa kaarykaal aise samay main puraa hua he, jab desh or pradesh main loksabhaa chunaav kaa bigul baj chukaa he
 Along with the Modi government, the performance of the Yogi government will also be tested in the election election of the state
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath 19 march 2017 ko soobe kii satta kii kaman sambhalate hi badlaav ke liye kai bade or kade faisle liye
 Along with curbing illegal slaughterhouses in the state and changing the names of cities, Yogi worked to break the myth by coming to Noida himself and giving the police an open exemption for the encounter of criminals
 soobe ke badlaav ke liye yogi ne uthaae 10 bade kadam
 
 
 
 1
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath gave a free hand to the police to curb the criminals and improve the law and order in the UP
 iske baad upi police ne aparaadhiyon ke khilaaf kathor karrwai karte hue encoutonr abhiyaan chalaaya
 Though questions were raised about this, but the government did not compromise on it

 2
 shaharon ke naam badale gaemukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne apane do saal ke kaarykaal main uttar pradesh main kai shaharon ke naam badalane kaa faisla kiya
 Among these, Mughalsarai station and city have been renamed as Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay
 iske alaava faijabad jile kaa naam badalakar ayodhya kar diya
 Similarly, the name of Allahabad was changed to Prayagraj
 3
 Adityanath, who banned illegal slaughterhouses, first banned illegal slaughterhouses as he ascended the throne of power
 yogi ke shapath lene ke duusare din se hi avaidh boojadkhaane band karne kii karrwai hone lagi
 In all cities such as Varanasi to Lakhimpur Kheri, Ghaziabad and Meerut, there was administration ban on illegal slaughterhouses and a large number of illegal slaughterhouses were closed
 4
 Policies made about cow After the Yogi government came to power in UP, many policy decisions were taken for the cow
 har jile main nae gaushala banane or har blaak ke kanjihouse ko gaushala main tabdeel karne kaa nirnay kiya gaya
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath 0 to build Gaushala
 5 fisadi ses charge lagaaya
 Apart from this, it was decided to provide all facilities such as cow care and fodder for them
 5
 Anti Romeo Squad: For the safety of women and children in Uttar Pradesh, the Yogi Adityanath government took the step of setting up Anti Romeo Squad
 iske baad upi police ne collejon or saarvajanik sthanon par mahilaon se chhedhkhani karne vaale manchalon kii dharpakad tej kar di thi
 However, many questions arose regarding this
 6
 Adityanath Sarkar, a copyless exam-maker, took strong steps to reform the education system after coming to power in 2017
 upi board kii 10veen or 12veen kii pariksha ko naklviheen banane ke liye vidyalayon ke centre par sisitivi camere lagaae gaye
 7
 purvanchal-bundelkhand par sarkaar meharbaanmukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne purvanchal or bundelkhand ke vikaas ke liye kai bade faisle liye hai
 Purvanchal and Bundelkhand Development Board formed
 iske alaava purvanchal express-ve or bundalekhand express-ve banane kaa bhi sarkaar ne faisla kiya
 Through this, there is a plan to connect the two areas with the state on one side and there is a preparation to give new momentum to development
 8
 Breaking the myth after coming to Noida, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath came to Noida and tried to break the myth that the Chief Minister of the state who comes to Noida gets away
 yogi ek baar nahin balki kai baar noida aane kaa kadam uthaaya he
 While there is a myth that VP Singh, Veer Bahadur Singh, Narayan Dutt Tiwari, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati came to Noida after CM, after which his government came to power
 9
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on the development of religious cities, opened the box of development for the religious cities of Uttar Pradesh as soon as he took command of power

 10
 kumbh ko banaaya 'divya kumbh'prayagraj main sangam par yogi sarkaar ne divya evam bhavy kumbh kaa safal aayojan karaayaa
 All these events changed the old perception about the state
 puure shahar ko sajaayaa or sanvaara gaya tha
 The budget was released ahead of time to make this Kumbh divine
 yogi khud kai baar prayagraj kaa daura kar vahaan kumbh kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja lete rahe
 When newspapers are dying in America and Europe, then there is a period of great boom in India, especially in Hindi newspapers
 lekin yah teji kai tarah ke tanaav bhi paidaa kar rahi he
 Newspaper groups are now finding the old playgrounds smaller
 ve vistaar kar rahe hai lekin aisa karte hi ve kisi or akhbaar ke kshetra main ghus jate hai, yah ladaai puure uttar bharat main ladi ja rahi he lekin is baar hindi ke akhabaaron ke bich kii ladaai kaa centrebindu bana he madhya pradesh
 Dainik Bhaskar, Rajasthan Patrika and Dainik Jagran, the three players who jumped in the number one Mahabharata, are face to face with their bully in this state of central India
 pathak sankhya ko badhaakar vigyaapan main zyada hissedari ke liye ye akhbaar vilay or adhigrahan par jor de rahe hai
 Due to the end of government concessions on paper and the weakening of the advertising market, the financial situation of younger and some old newspapers has collapsed, and they have become excellent deals for acquisition
 jaagran or bhaskar jaise samooh bazaar main maujuud kuch sthapit samoohon kaa adhigrahan kar rahe hai, to rajasthan patrika apni kshetreey pahchaan ko kinare rakh anya rajyon main patrika ke naam se vistaar kar rahaa he
 Jagran Prakashan Limited has recently acquired and established a presence in Madhya Pradesh's established and well-known newspaper Naiduniya
 samooh ke siio or sampadak sanjay gupt india today se kehete hai, ''naiduniya hamaare liye taarkik vistaar tha kyonki yah madhya bharat main hamaari joardaar maujuudagi main madad karegaa
 Nai Duniya's strong editorial team has tremendous credibility
 vilay or adhigrahan ke madhyam se vistaar or vikaas karne kii hamaari ranneetik yojana ke antargat yah mid de ke baad doosraa adhigrahan he
 This has increased our scope and made it possible for us to take advantage of our existing network
 '' desh kaa sabase zyada pathakon vaala media samooh hone kaa daawa karte hue gupt kehete hai, ''indian readership survey main samooh kaa everej ishyu readership (iares) 2
 06 crores and Jagran is number one for the last 21 times
 '' is aankade main naiduniya bhi shaamil he
 Madhya Pradesh has traditionally been a stronghold of Dainik Bhaskar
 bhaskar kii pratishtha nae garh banane or purana kila bachaae rakhane kii rahi he
 Girish Agarwal, director of Bhaskar Group, says, "dainik Bhaskar Group is a reliable media group with integrity, fairness and purpose, which 1
 91 karod pathakon kii chahat ke saath bharat ke sabase teji se badhate 13 bazaaron main maujuud he
 "but with these media groups vying to enter into each other's market and grab big shares, the battle of figures is also very interesting
" bhaskar group ke brands communication head sanjeev kotnala ausat prati pathak ke aankadon ke aadhaar par daawa karte hai, ''hamaare samooh kaa everej ishyu readership (eiar) 1
 91 crores, while Jagran Group's AIR 1
 78 karod he
 The Bhaskar group does not add Naiduniya, Nav Duniya, Jagran Sakhi and Jagran Josh to it
 lekin bhaskar ne apane samooh ke aankade main diene ko joda he, jo ek saajha upkram he
 Though Jagran Publications Ltd
 ke vaais president (stratji, brands and bijness deveopment) basant rathod jaagran samooh ko bhaskar se kamatar bataane vaale daawey ko tathyaviheen bataate hai
 They claim, "according to IRS, our group's AIR 2
 06 karod or kul readership 6
 85 crores
 eiar or kul readership donon hi aadhaar par ham bharat ke numbervan media samooh hai'' unke is daawey main dainik jaagran, aai next, mid de (angreji), mid de (gujarati), inkulab, naiduniya, nav duniya, jaagran sakhi or jaagran josh shaamil he
 But apart from these two big groups, Patrika Group also claims to be number two in Hindi dailies
 patrika ke neshnal head (marketing) arvind kaaliya kehete hai, ''hindi dainikon main patrika duusare sthaan par he
 According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC), our average circulation is 21 lakhs per day
 ''darasal har samooh aankadon ko apni sahuuliyat ke nazariye se dekhtaa he or iares yaa abisi ke nattejey jab bhi aate hai, akhabaaron main khud ko number ek bataane kii hode much jaati he
 After the acquisition of Naidunia, the competition for newspaper groups in Madhya Pradesh has intensified
 dainik bhaskar ke ekadhikaar ko todane ke liye madhya pradesh main apana kadam aage badha chuke patrika kaa daawa he ki bhopal, indore, jabalpur, gwalior main vah pathakon kii badhat ke aadhaar par number van he
 He also took out commercials in this regard
 indore sanskaran main patrika parivaar ke varishthatam sadsy gulab kothaari likhte hai, ''aankade kuch bhi kehete honge, lekin dilon ko jeetne main patrika ke aage koi nahin thahar paaegaa
 '' But Dainik Bhaskar does not consider the magazine a challenge

 corp ke kotnala kehete hai, ''iares ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik, madhya pradesh main hamaari readership 38 lakh he, jabaki hamaare nikatatam pratidwandvi akhbaar kii readership mahaj 16 lakh he
 We are also ahead of the total of six other newspapers in the state on the basis of average readership

 Why is Madhya Pradesh the hottest spot in the media competition? State CII Chairman R

 "last 8-10 years ago, Madhya Pradesh was a very backward state," says Goswami
 lekin ab tasviir badali he or kisi bhi rajya kii vikaas dar badhati he, to pratispardhaa bhi badhati he
 This is the reason that there is increased competition among media groups to increase their share in the state through business
 vaise bhi ye sabhi group pehle se hi rajya ke bijness main bhi hai or aarthik tarakkee ne pratispardhaa paidaa kii he
 "it is clear that all the groups are trying to become the princes of the state through expansionary policy
" jaagran samooh ne 2007 main pehle indore se apni shuruyaat kii thi
 But if it did not succeed as expected, now through the acquisition of Naidunia, Dainik Jagran has taken a step towards strengthening its presence in Central India
 patrika samooh ne 25 may, 2008 ko bhopal se apni laanching kii
 Arvind Kalia, the national marketing head of the magazine, says without naming Dainik Bhaskar, "madhya Pradesh had a monopoly in the market before the magazine's entry
 ab ham garv se kah sakate hai ki ek akhbaar vishesh kaa varchasv khatm ho gaya he
 '' Senior General Manager (circulation) of Patrika Group b

 "there was a big difference between number one and two in the Madhya Pradesh market," says Singh
 lekin aaj ham bhopal-indore main sarvaadhik prasar vaale dainik ban chuke hai
 "though Madhya Pradesh is currently the center of this battle of media supremacy, its real beginning was in December 1996, when Dainik Bhaskar challenged it by entering the magazine's den in Rajasthan
" shuruyaat main to patrika ne ise gambhirtha se nahin liya, lekin keemat ghataane kii jang ke baad bhaskar ne jab chunauti pesh kii to patrika kii mushkilen badhane lageen
 Says Kotnala, "we became number one on the very first day with the launch in Jaipur
 rajasthan main hamaari safalataa desh ke prabandhan sansthaanon ke liye ek cese study ban gai or apane focus kshetra shahari rajasthan main ham sabase bade akhbaar hai
 The magazine also challenged Bhaskar's monopoly in Madhya Pradesh in the same manner
 iske baad bhaskar samooh ne jaagran samooh ko lalkaarna shuru kiya
 In the year 2000, Bhaskar presented a challenge to Jagran in Haryana and with this, Amar Ujala entered haryana-punjab, which is considered to be a stronghold of Punjab Kesari
 is daur main keemat or akhabaari maapdand main kai badlaav aae
 After this, there was a halt in this Mahabharata of the media, but Bhaskar once again stormed into Punjab, the region of Jagran
 punjab main bhaskar se mili chunauti ke baad jaagran ne gurumukhi lipi main hi akhbaar laanch kar diya
 Bhaskar then entered Jharkhand, a stronghold of leading newspapers like Prabhat Khabar and Hindustan, and is now in the final stages of preparing to go to a big state like Bihar
 dilli or bihar kaa pramukh akhbaar hindustan in dinon khaskar uttar pradesh main apana lagaataar vistaar kar rahaa he or nae sanskan khol rahaa he
 At the same time, Jharkhand newspaper Prabhat Khabar has made a move in Bihar
 bazaar main hissedari ke liye adhigrahan or vilay bhi jari he
 When Bhaskar formed a joint venture with Zee Group to launch the English newspaper DNA in Mumbai, Jagaran in response acquired Midday, Urdu newspaper Inquilab and more recently Naiduniya
 bazaar kii charchaaon kii maane, to jald hi bhaskar samooh ek or angreji akhbaar apane saath laane or bihar main jabardast chunauti dene kii taiyaari main he, to jaagran kii najar bhi kolkata sthit ek angreji akhbaar par he
 His conversation is said to be going on with Odia, Gujarati as well as an established Hindi media group in North India
 agle paanch-chah maah main adhigrahan kii kuch tasviren saaf hone kii sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he
 Not just acquisitions, media groups are constantly training and holding annual meetings to keep their structure fit
 jaagran ne marketing se jude logon ko kushal banane ke liye calendar bana rakhaa he, to bhaskar ne global company del carnegi ko apane saath joda he
 Media groups may have spread the Mahabharata, but the figures for the fourth quarter of IRS 2011 show that Dainik Jagran recorded 48,000, Dainik Bhaskar 2, compared to the previous quarter
 74 lakh, rajasthan patrika ne 71,000 pathak khoe hai
 Whereas the group, which is making a move out of the name of the magazine outside Rajasthan, has increased a record of 25 per cent
 naiduniya ne bhi chauthi timahi main vruddhi kii he, lekin use 10wein sthaan par khisakna padaa he
 Overall, the Hindi media is in a period of great turmoil
 pratispardhaa ke is daur main har samooh apana dayera bada dikhaanaa chahta he, taaki bazaar main uskaa ecchhatra raaj kaayam ho sake

 The Betwa river, drained by the intensity of 150 lakh cusecs of water released from both dams, was inundated

 pichley saal disambar main van-de cricket se sanyas lene vaale tendulkar ne enditivi se kaha, mujhe laga ki jab ham 2015 main australia or newjiland jaaenge to hamen dobaaraa trophy uthaane ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 i could not see myself playing in the 2015 World Cup, so i felt that i should step away and the team should move forward and make a balanced combination for the 2015 World Cup
 is 39 varshiya ballebaaj ne kaha ki bhartiya team ke khitaab ke bachaav karne kii koshish ko dekhte hue unka van-de se sanyas lene kaa faisla sahi tha
 Tendulkar, who retired from ODI cricket in December last year, told NDTV, "I felt that when we go to Australia and New Zealand in 2015, we should be fully prepared to lift the trophy again
" main khud ko 2015 vishwa cap main khelte hue nahin dekh paa rahaa tha isliye mujhe laga ki mujhe hat janaa chahie or team ko aage badhanaa chahie tathaa 2015 vishwacap ke liye santulit sangyojan bananaa chahie

 We had our second day in Kashmir
 subah-subah ham packing kar taiyaar the
 Abid had said that one day is enough on a houseboat
 usne hamen baaki bache do din hotel main thaharne kii salaah di thi
 We were sitting in the houseboat verandah waiting for him
 photo vaale or pheri waalon ne hamen sukun se baithne nahin diya
 The hawkers driving the paddle of the boat one after the other will tease you
 baavzood in sabake subah-subah dal jhil behad kuubasurat lag rahi thi
 The children were going to school on a boat
 maqbool kii beti bhi skool ja rahi thi
 His younger sister was also insisting on going with him
 aabid aa gaya tha
 Maqbool drove us from boat to car
 hamane maqbool se vidaa lee
 Abid took us to the hotel
 ye hotel dal kii chahal-pahal se thodi dur tha
 Probably belonged to his relative
 hamen pasand nahin aayaa
 First he promised to take us to Hotel Paradise, which was near Dal
 hamane kaha ki gulmarg se lautne par ham hotel lenge
 We left for Gulmarg with luggage
 aabid hamaare faisale se zyaada khush nahin dikhaa
 On the way, army personnel were stationed in the field till the barn
 inhen yon khadaa dekhakar dukh bhi laga
 Don't know how many decades this has been happening in Kashmir
 na jane kitne log maare ja chuke hai
 The politicians of both the countries probably do not want any solution to the Kashmir problem to run politics
 raste main uri or sopor kaa sin board dikhaa
 We started talking about one of our relatives, who was a major in the army and was once stationed in Uri
 sena kaa zikr aate hi aabid ke chehre kaa rang badalane laga tha
 Apple orchards on both sides of the route from Srinagar to Gulmarg and the Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas in front
 adbhut drishy tha
 The snow-clad peaks were calling us
 raste main naashte ke liye ham ruke tanmarg main
 Paranthas were very tasty
 vahaan hamen guide ke jhund ne gher liya
 Maqbool had told us not to fall in the circle of the guides in Gulmarg
 aabid ne ham se kah diya ki wo kuch nahin kar paaegaa
 "they are very aggressive
 aap log khud inase nibat lenaa
 By the way, there is no need for a guide
 " Two young guide boys just clung to us
 khud hi apana rate bakaat ja rahe the
 "1200 is the rate
 chalo 800 de dena
 Let's give 400
 " aabid ne hamen salaah di ki gulmarg ke barf kaa mazaa lene ke liye hamen jacket or boot yaheen bhaade par le lene chahie
 The guides also followed there
 "saal main kuch maheene to kamai hoti he wo bhi aap log nahin dete ho
 That is why we talk about meeting in Pakistan
 " Meanwhile, after a good price, he agreed to give the clothes for 300 rupees per jacket-boot
 vahiin par hamane safed rang kaa ek rui kaa bahut bada gola dekha
 Later it is revealed that he is snow
 hamaare liye barf kaa pehla darshan tha
 The comments jacket or boot lekar ham gaadi main baithe to ve guide phir aa gaye
 Opening the car door said, "if every tourist keeps doing this, only Pakistan will go
 ye hi acha hoga
 "of course the youth here have been shown vegetable
 pakistan kii khud kii haalat kitni buree he, ye puri duniya jaanati he, lekin yahaan ke yuvaaon ko itnaa gumraah kar diya gaya he ki unhen apni samasyaon kaa hal pakistan main hi nazar aata he
 i myself came to Pakistan for two months in 2006 to cover the cricket series
 tab vahaan aatank kii dehshat utani nahin thi, jo ab he
 But even then there was fear all the time
 tab bhi pakistan ke aarthik halaat behatar nahin the
 Leave it for today
 ek kadam aage or 4 kadam peeche chalane vaale mulk se judakar koi kaise soch saktaa he ki uskaa bhala ho saktaa he
 Perhaps the need is that Kashmir should be developed as much as possible
 kaarkaane khulen taaki berozegaar naujavaanon ko kaam mili
 When work is found, they will have less time to mislead

 unhone kaha ki ek artiai ke jariye unhen pataa chalaa he ki dilli sarkaar ne pichley dedh se 2 lakh 3 hajaar se zyada rashan card abhi tak kaa vitaran nahin kiya he
 The Delhi government is taking ration from the central government in the name of these 2 lakh 3 thousand ration cards for the last year and a half
 jab card baanta hi nahin to rashan kyon lete hai ?manoj tiwarika kahana he ki in do lakh teen hajaar rashan card par kareeb 10 lakh logon kaa rashan dilli sarkaar le rahi he
 She is getting nearly Rs 400 crore worth of ration from the central government

 He said that he had written a letter to Kejriwal on 26 May on this ration scam, but he has received no reply from the Delhi government so far
 tiwari ne kaha ki arvind kejariwal raajnneeti main bhashtrachaar ke khilaaf ladaai ladakar aae the
 If the action did not take place, warning of the sit-in, he said that after the scam came to light, Arvind Kejriwal should not only sack the food supply minister but also resign himself as the Chief Minister of Delhi
 tiwari ne chetavanee diki agar ek hafte main kejariwal ne is ghotaale par koi karrwai nahin kii to unke khilaaf dilli kii sadakon par dharna-pradarshan kii shuruyaat hogi

 Taking cognizance of this, the Election Commission had also issued a notice to Khurshid's wife, to which Khurshid's response was that 'notice has been received, not an execution order'

 Sidhu used to hold the ministry of local bodies in the state government, but now he has been given the responsibility of the Ministry of Power
 lekin, is badlaav ke baad jo pehali cabinet meeting bulaai gai uskaa siddhu ne bycott kiya
 Earlier, Sidhu had said that he is the only leader in Punjab whom the state government is ignoring
 vah akele haar ke liye jimmedaar nahin hai, unhen jin kshetron kaa jimmaa diya gaya tha vahaan par party kii jeet hui he
 On the other hand, if you talk about Captain Amarinder Singh, he said that the way Navjot Singh Sidhu hugged the head of the Pakistani army, it sent a wrong message to the country
