 In 2014, when Narendra Modi took over as the Prime Minister, he did not let his close friend Amit Shah also stay in Gujarat but instead made him a BJP president and indicated that he does not want to let loose his grip on the government as well as the organization
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko mili prachand jeet ke peeche amit shah kii kushal ranneeti kaa haath bataaya gaya
 After this, assembly elections were held in many states
 kahin bijepi ko jeet mili to kahin haar kaa munh bhi dekhnaa padaa
 Anandiben was given power in Gujarat when Modi came to RCR 7, but not even two years later, the CM had to change
 guruuvar ko surat main amit shah kii sabha main jo hua, usase aise sanket milane lage ki yaa to rajya main sabakuch thik nahin he yaa phir amit shah, jo kabhi 'modi ke hanuman' tak kahe gaye unka tilism tut rahaa he
 Shah's program in Patidabahul Surat on Thursday created a ruckus
 hardik patel ke liye narebaaji kii gai to amit shah waapas jaao ke naare lage
 All chairs were gone
 halaat itane kharaab ho gaye ki chaar ghante tak chalane vaalakaaryakramek ghante main hi khatm karnaa padaa
 This program was done by the Patidar community associated with BJP to show strength
 iskaa makasad yah dikhaanaa tha ki bijepi ko ab bhi patidaaron kaa puraa samarthan hasil he
 But during the uproar, it was clear from the posters of 'general Dyer Go Back' on the streets of Surat that the impact of the BJP national president is now diminishing
 aise main un vajahon ko jaananaa jaruri he jinase amit shah yaa phir kahen to gujarat main bijepi ke khilaaf hawa chalane lagi he
 1
 jab narendra modi gujarat ke siem the to party or sarkaar main kisi tarah kii khinchataan kii khabar nahin aati lekin inke dilli jate hi jaise sabakuch bikharane laga
 The popularity of rival Congress has started increasing in the state

 Recently, when the power of Gujarat was handed over from Anandiben to Vijay Rupani, the infighting of the party had come to the fore
 vidhayak dal kii baithak main anandiben ne roopani ke naam par vito laga diya
 She wanted to hand over cm's chair to Nitin Patel
 haalanki, piem modi kii dakhal ke baad anandiben jhukin or roopani ko netaa chunaa gaya

 The situation became so bad that curfew was imposed in all areas
 gauratlab he ki 2002 ke dangon ke baad pehali baar rajya main karfu lagaana padaa tha
 5
 hardik patel ko deshadroh ke aarope main jail main daal diya gaya tha
 This organization is demanding 27 percent reservation in government jobs and education, along with giving OBC status to the Patel community
 6
 The BJP claims that the Patidars are still with them but during the Hardik Patel agitation, the manner in which the state government handled the entire matter is said to be angry with the large section of the community
 7
 Dalits of Gujarat have been voting for BJP for the last 15-20 years
 modi ke gujarat model main dalit bhi shaamil hai
 But the incidence of Dalit oppression in the state has increased in the last 10-15 years
 pichley dinon oona kii ghatana or uski pratikriya main ahmedabad main daliton kii vishaal raily se sanket milane lage hai ki bijepi kaa dalit vot bank darkane laga he

 bataa den ki justise khehar aise vakt main chif justise bane hai, jab karypalika or nyaaypalika ke bich jajon kii niyukti ko lekar takaraav kii khabaren aa chuki hai
 Know Justice Khehar The full name of 64-year-old Justice JS Khehar is Jagdish Singh Khehar and people also know him because of his strict mood
 unka janm punjab main hua or punjab uniwarsity se padhai puri kii
 Khehar, who has been a Supreme Court judge since September 2011, is a strict legal administrator and does not like the waste of court time at all
 khehar vakeelon par bhi sakhti dikhaate hai
 The lawyers often get scolded for not coming to court with full preparation
 ek baar sunwaayee ke dauraan khehar court room se baahar nikal gaye, kyonki vakil ne apane kagajaat sahi tareeke se pesh nahin kiye the
 Actually, Khehar wants lawyers to come to court only after completing homework

 nyaayamurti khehar ne sahaara maamle kii sunwaayee se khud ko alag kiya Attacking Ratan Tata again, the group's ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry dismissed allegations that he did not contribute to the group's milch cows, TCS and JLR
 iske ulat mistre ne samooh ke pramukh ratan tata par aarope lagaaya ki unhone iti company ko ibiem ko bechney kaa prayaas kiya tha
 He said that Ratan Tata took bad business decisions like Chorus in his 'arrogance'
 kores kaa adhigrahan mul laagat se doguna main kiya gaya
 a five-page letter issued from Mistry's office states that it is necessary to straighten out the matter as the attacks and leaks are being done only to create the illusion that Mistry was the chairman to keep himself away and TCS-JLR was his She was leading herself in leadership
 patr main mistre dwaara donon companiyon ke kaaryakari chairman ke rup main kiye gaye prayaason kaa zikr kiya gaya he jisaki vajah se in companiyon ne samooh ke munaafe main 90 pratishat kaa yogadan diya
 It has been mentioned in the letter that the group from salt to software sector is busy taking credit for this great performance
 patr main kaha gaya he ki ratan tata ne ek baar samooh kii ‘nagina’ company tisies ko vaishvik diggaj company ibiem ko bechney kaa prayaas kiya tha
 Ratan Tata has been appointed as the interim chairman after Mistry was removed on October 24
 haalanki, patr main iske liye koi samay nahin bataaya gaya he
 It added that JRD Tata could not pursue Ratan Tata's proposal due to illness of the then chief FC Kohli
 mistre ne kaha he ki ratan tata us tata industries ke ibiem ke saath sanyukt udhyam kii aguwai kar rahe the
 He had approached JRD Tata to sell TCS to IBM
 jearady ne is saude par vichaar karne se manaa kar diya tha kyonki kohli us samay aspataal main the
 The comments haalanki, gharelu software udyog ke diggaj kahe jane vaale kohli se spasht rup se is prastaav ko khaarij karte hue kaha tha ki tisies kaa bhavishya kaaphi ujjwal he or samooh ko company ko nahin bechnaa chahie
 The letter stated that JRD subsequently turned down the offer
 patr main daawa kiya gaya he ki yah ratan tata kii ore se tisies ke liye ‘lagbhag maut’ kaa anubhav tha
 This is the third letter in the order of clarification issued by the office of Mistry
 isamen aarope lagaaya gaya he ki ratan tata ne ‘ahm’ main kharaab kaarobaari faisle liye
 The acquisition of UK steel company Corus is one such decision
 iske alaava apane doorsanchaar kaarobaar ke liye sidime praudyogiki par hi tike rahe jisase hajaaron naukariyaan sankat main pad gayi
 In contrast, Mistry accused group head Ratan Tata of attempting to sell the IT company to IBM
 unhone kaha ki ratan tata ne apane ‘ahankaar’ main kores jaise kharaab kaarobaari faisle liye
 Corus was acquired at twice the original cost
 mistre ke karyaalay se jari paanch prishth ke patr main kaha gaya he ki is maamle ko sidhaa karnaa jaruri he kyonki akshep or li sirf yah bhram paidaa karne ke liye kii ja rahi he ki mistre apane ko dur rakhane vaale chairman the or tisies-jeelar unke netritv main khud se aage bad rahi thim
 The letter referred to the efforts made by Mistry as the executive chairman of both companies, which contributed to 90 per cent of the group's profits
 patr main is kaa zikr kiya gaya he ki namak se saftware kshetra kaa samooh is shandaar pradarshan kaa shrey lene main vyast he
 The letter said that Ratan Tata had once attempted to sell the group's 'nagina' company TCS to global giant IBM

 dilli mahila ayog ne saat maheene se apni maa ke ghar main kaidi kii tarah rah rahi ek ladki ko rescue karaayaa he
 The only mistake this girl made was that she got married against the will of her parents

 a day earlier, at three o'clock in the night, on the tweeter handle of Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Jaihind, Rajesh (name changed) asked for help to rescue his wife Savita (name changed) from her home
 rajesh ne kaha ki uski patni ko uske hi ghar waalon ne pichley saat maheenon se ghar main kaid karke rakhaa hua he
 Early in the morning, Swati Jaihind, the chairperson of the Delhi Women's Commission, formed a team led by Kiran Negi, the co-ordinator of the mobile helpline of the commission and sent the girl to rescue
 dilli mahila ayog kii team police ko saath lekar savita ke ghar pahunch gai
 Where Savita and her family live
 shuru main savita apane parivaar se bahut dari hui thi isliye kuch nahin bol rahi thi
 After her counseling by the team of the commission, Savita told the whole thing
 savita ne bataaya ki uski umr 20 saal he or usne janvari 2017 main mata-pita kii marji ke khilaaf ek ladke rajesh ke saath prem vivaah kar liya tha
 After which both were living together in Noida
 savita ne bataaya ki march main uski maa kii tabiyat achaanak bahut kharaab ho gai or uske pita kaa phone aane ke baad vah apane pati ke saath apni maa ko dekhne chali gai
 After going to Savita's house, her housemates refused to send her back with her husband and drove Rajesh away
 savita ke ghar waalon ne donon ke shaadi ke saare dastavej bhi faad die or donon ko jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di
 Savita told that she was not allowed to go out after being imprisoned in the house for 7 months
 ghar par hameshaa koi naa koi rahata tha
 They were kept locked outside the house
 vahiin duusari ore rajesh ke ghar vaale bhi is shaadi ke khilaaf the
 So he was not getting any help from his family too
 rajesh ne madad ke liedilli polisake alaava upi police se bhi madad maangi lekin use koi madad nahin mili
 The boy said that he had written to the Delhi and UP police on Twitter on 22 September and sought help but could not get any help
 aakhirkaar uski koshish us samay kaamyaab hui jab usne dilli mahila ayog se madad maangi
 Now both are together and both have written to the police that if any untoward happens to them then their parents will be responsible for this
 dilli mahila ayog kii cheirperson swatijyahind ne ki 21veen sadi main desh kii rajdhani dilli main bhi aisa ho rahaa he ki ek ladki jo apni marji se shaadi kar leti he to use kaid kar liya jaataa he, unhone kaha ki mahilaon ke adhikaron ke liye abhi bahut lambii ladaai ladi jaani baaki he, unhone rajesh kii himmat kii daad di jisane haar nahin maani or apni patni ko waapas paa liya

 According to the exit poll on Friday, there is a close fight between Congress and BJP in Madhya Pradesh
 agsit pole main donon dalon ke bich kaa faasla mahaj kuch siton kaa he
 In such a situation, the absence of an alliance with the BSP can shatter the dreams of the Congress
 india today or exis maay india ke agsit pole main madhya pradesh main congress ko maamuli badhat milti dikh rahi he
 In the India Today exit poll, out of the total 230 assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress is projected to get 104 to 122 seats and BJP too 102 to 120 seats
 jabaki basapa ko 3 or anya ko 3 se 8 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 There is a slight difference in vote share between the two
 congress ko 41% or bijepi ko 40% vot mil sakate hai
 The BSP may get 4 per cent and others 15 per cent
 aise main agar congress or basapa milakar chunaav ladate to vot fisadi jahaan 45 fisadi hota to siton main bada ijapha ho saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Congress could return to power by not only giving a tough fight to the Congress
 si voter, abeepi or chanakya ke eczit pole main congress ko purna bahumat miltaa dikh rahaa he
 Whereas in the survey of Times Now, BJP is returning to power once again
 haalanki sabhi survey main basapa or anya ko 3 se 8 siton ke bich milti dikh rahi he
 Explain that the Congress had given full force to return to power in Madhya Pradesh
 congress-basapa ke bich chunaav se pehle gathbandhan kii baaten chal rahi thi
 But Mayawati blamed Congress leader Digvijay Singh for not having an alliance
 iske baad congress donon partiyaan alag-alag chunaav ladi thi
 The BSP has a significant influence in the districts of Chambal, Bundelkhand and UP in Madhya Pradesh
 basapa ne takreeban sabhi siton par apane ummidavaar utaare the
 In such a situation, he has got some votes on every seat
 jabaki agar donon ke bich gathbandhan hote to ye vot basapa ke bajaay congress ko milte
 In this way, the Congress would not look like a thorn but return with a clear majority in power
 vahiin, rajasthan or chhattisgarh vidhansabha main bhi basapa ko kuch siten milti dikh rahi he
 However, most exit polls show an absolute majority to the Congress
 basapa saath milakar chunaav congress chunavi maidan hoti to siton main or bhi zyada badhotaree ho sakati thi

 Partial Solar Eclipse 2019: aanshik surya grahan main khaane ke seven ko lekar ye hai galat dharanaayengrahan armbh- subah 09:04 par
 Eclipse Middle - Ultimate Grass - At 10:42 in the morning
 grahan sparsh samaapt- subah 11:13 par
 Eclipse ends - 12:21 pm
 chaliye ab jaanate hai ki chandra grahan (chandra Grahan) hota kaise he
 You already know that the earth revolves around the sun
 is prakriya main jab kabhi prithvi apane upgrah chandramaa or suraj ke bich aa jaati he to chand par padane vaali suraj kah kirane ruk jaati hai or dharti kii prachhaya chand par padati he
 Due to this astronomical event, the moon stops appearing and this is called lunar eclipse
 kaise hota he grahan, kya hai isse judi prathaen
 
 
 Learn what to eat and what not
 
 
 Kumbh 2019: prayagraj ke 6 mashhoor food adde, jahaan janaa to banataa he
 
 
 1
 hindu manyata ke anusaar chandragrahan (chandra Grahan) ke dauraan bhojan nahin karnaa chahie
 People have this myth or say that it is valid that during this time a person who eats food goes to hell
 2
 It is believed that if there is a need to drink water during the eclipse, then either add sesame seeds in it or else add Kush, Dube or Tulsi leaves
 3
 In most Hindu homes, before the eclipse starts, food or water, and other food items are added to leaves of dab or basil
 mana jaataa he ki aisa karne se khaanaa ashuddh nahin hota
 4
 kehete hai ki chandra grahan main teen prahar purv aahaar nahin lenaa chahie
 Lunar eclipse science: There are many myths regarding the lunar eclipse (chandra Grahan), which are spread among people
 logon main yah manyata he ki vishakt vikiranon kii vazah se paryaavaran main vishaanu failte hai, jo khaane ko dooshit karte hai
 This is the reason that people also avoid cutting fruits and vegetables at the time of eclipse
 protein se bharpoor ye 3 dry fruits baili fat ghataane main kar sakate hai aapaki madad- is dauraan halkaa satvik bhojan le sakate hai
 Which are easy to digest and also light for stomach
 is dauraan khaane main aap mewa le sakate hai
 It will give full energy to the body even in small amounts
 - kya grahan ke dauraan pani pi sakate hai? : is dauraan pani pine se bhi bachanaa chahie
 Because bacteria are active due to absence of them
 agar aap biimaar hai yaa aap garbhvatee hai to aap halkaa garm pani pi sakate hai
 You can boil 8-10 drops of basil juice or leaves
 iske saath hi agar aap sada pani nahin pinaa chaahate to nariyal kaa pani pi sakate hai
 It would be best to drink a good amount of water before the eclipse
 harad ke phaayde: bavasir, kabj or sujan samet kai rogon ko karti he dur, padhein- grahan ke dauraan kya na khaaen! : manyata ke anusaar is dauraan non-veg aahaar bilkul nahin lenaa chahie
 During this time, alcohol, yeast and high protein food should also not be taken
 yah pachaane main bahut hi mushkil hota he
 - What to do after the eclipse: After the eclipse you can return to your normal diet
 iske baad fal khaanaa acha sabit hoga
 This is good because fruits contain a large amount of antioxidants which will help detox the body and boost energy

 The debate over the need for a censor board to control Indian cinema will always continue, but Central Film Certification Board (CBFC) chairperson Sharmila Tagore says the board does not act as a police instructor for films
 vah kahati hai ki samay ke saath sensor board main bhi badlaav hue hai
 Sharmila said, we see ourselves as more of a body certifying films than censor boards
 ham naitikta nahin sikhaate
 We take the middle path
 ham filmon main bahut si chijen jane dete hai, kyonki hamen adhik sahishnu or paripakv hona padaa he
 Time is changing and we have had to change with it too
 unhone kaha, main sensorship or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa donon main vishwaas karti hum, lekin iske saath hi jaij pratibandh bhi hone chahie
 Changes showing generosity will last longer
 64 varshiya sharmila 2004 main sensor board kii adhyaksh bani thim
 Ever since he took up this job, the content, dialogue and story of the films have changed a lot
 nirdeshkon ne 'tere bin laden' jaisi kam bajet kii film bhi banaai, to 'dev di' or 'lav sex or dhokhaa' jaisi saahasik vishyon vaali filmein bhi baniin
 There was a time when the censor board objected to the use of abusive words in films, but now abuses have been used heavily in films like 'omkara', 'kaminey', 'ishqiya' and 'no One Killed Jessica' Yes, it is definitely that these films got an A-certificate, due to which only adult people could see them

 a senior university official said that this issue is being politicized unnecessarily and such questions have been coming in the past

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, called Captain Cool, has been playing for India for 10 years
 teenon formet main captaini karne vaale chuninda khilaadiyon main se vah bhi ek hai
 Let's have a look today on those moments, which made the Ranchi city player's height in the cricket world
 1-joardaar entry When the first World Cup of T20 was held in 2007, no senior players of Team India went there
 sachin tendulkar ke kehane par team india kii captaini yuva mahendra singh dhoni ko di gai
 Nobody of this team full of youth had expected to succeed in this format but Mahendra Singh Dhoni made Anhoni happen
 bharat ko maahi ne kaise champion banaaya, yah puri duniya ne dekha
 Then neither the T20 format looked back and neither did Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 2
 Definition of changed wicket-keeper bhartiya cricket main mahendra singh dhoni ne wicketiper ballebaaj kii paribhaasha hi badal kar rakh di
 He told that the work of the wicket-keeper is equally important not just behind the stumps but also ahead of them
 test hon, van-de hon yaa phir tii20, kai maukon par dhoni ne apane balle se match kaa rukh mode diya
 He is the only Indian wicket-keeper to score a double century in Tests in addition to the fastest century by an Indian wicket-keeper in Tests
 lekin, vanade cricket main match jitaane kii unki kaabiliyat kaa har koi kaayal ho gaya
 Dhoni knows how to win a lost match
 dhoni vanade main bharat ke hi nahin, duniya ke best finishr kahalaane lage
 3
 sabase kaamyaab vanade captain Although Dhoni's captaincy in Test matches can be questioned, but there is no dispute on who is India's most successful captain in odis
 pichley sitambar main maahi ne vanade cricket main sabase zyada jeet darj karne kaa purv captain mohammad azahruddin kaa record bhi tod diya tha
 Dhoni has so far won 93 ODI matches
 itnaa hi nahin, vanade hon, test hon yaa tii 20, har formet main bharat ko sabase jeet dilaane kaa record dhoni ke naam hi he
 Although you can compare Dhoni with former captains, but if you talk about statistics, Dhoni leaves everyone behind
 vanade vishwa cap ho, champions trophy ho, yaa tii20 vishwacap ho, khel ke itihaas main vah iklaute captain hai, jo ye teenon khitaab apane naam kar paae hai
 4
 test main bhi bane best Dhoni also repeated the success of colored clothes in white clothes
 6 disambar 2009 ko jab bharat test cricket main number 1 kii kursi par kabiz hua to bharat ke captain dhoni hi the
 Under Dhoni's captaincy, players like Sehwag, Harbhajan and Gambhir were at their peak and the team also became the best in Tests
 5
 World-winning captain dhoni kii captaini ko hameshaa ke liye yaadgaar bana gaya ek khaas lamhaa
 Team India established its reign in cricket by winning odis after 28 years
 dhoni ne jis tareeke se puure vishwa cap main senior khilaadiyon kii captaini kii, vah cricket main sabake liye ek sabak tha
 Along with the hearts of the fans, Mahendra Singh Dhoni had written his name in the cricket world forever
 dalit sanghathanon kii ore se nau agast ke prastaavit 'bharat band' se pehle bhaajapa unki maangon par apana jawaab taiyaar karne main kaaphi satarkta barat rahi he
 Its Dalit mps and allies, including Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, want the BJP to respond positively to their demands, while many party leaders are advising to be cautious, as it may be that the government always responds more enthusiastically Did not like a large section supporting from

 Many BJP mps, on the condition of not disclosing the name, said that a section of the party's traditional voters - forward castes and other backward castes, have progressed on issues related to reservation of Dalits and alleged misuse of atrocities on Dalits and tribals
 Despite objections, he has supported the party till now
 uttar pradesh se bhaajapa ke ek saansad ne kaha, 'ham chaahate hai ki party dalit hiton ke muddon par uchit jawaab de, lekin aisa nahin dikhnaa chahie ki vah dalit sanghathanon kii har maang maanane ke liye ati utsahit he, kyonki bhaajapa ko hindu samaaj ke zyaadaatar virgon se samarthan miltaa he or use unki chintaaen bhi dhyaan main rakhni chahie

 vahiin paswan ke bete or loksabhaa sadsy chiraag paswan ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko patr likhakar goyal ko engiti adhyaksh ke pad se hataane kii maang kii he
 Dalit mps like bjp's Udit Raj have also supported this demand
 bhaajapa nedlit utpeedan kanoonko kathith taur par kamjor karne vaale ucchtam nyaayalay ke faisle ke virodh kaa samarthan kiya he
 The Central Government has filed a review petition in this regard
 sarkaar ne nyaayalay kaa rukh kar dalit evam adivasee sarkari karmiyon ko tarakkee main aarakshan kii vyavastha behaal karne kii maang kii he
 However, the government has not responded to the demand for an ordinance or a new bill in Parliament to overturn the apex court order
 akhil bhartiya ambedkar mahasabha ke binar tale dalit sanghathanon ne nau agast ko 'bharat band' yojit karne kaa aahvaan kiya he taaki ve apni maangon ko lekar sarkaar par dabaav bana saken

 Meera Chopra, sister of Bollywood actress Priyanka Chopra, has accused a five star hotel in Ahmedabad of serving bad food

 com / hgty6d9ck2 — meera chopra (@meerrachopra) August 23, 2019 kuch din se aam aadmi party cover karne vaale ek patrkaar kaa dil or dimag ek baat samaj nahin paa rahaa tha- aakhir kyon arvind kejariwal achaanak saare laav lashkar lekar narendra modi ke khilaaf jhanda buland kiye ja rahe hai? aakhir kyon kejariwal kii baat se aisa lag rahaa he ki is samay desh kii sabase badi samasya modi hai? After all, why are there such indications from the Aam Aadmi Party that from where Modi will fight, Kejriwal will be the candidate? aakhir kyon achaanak kejariwal modi se kisi bhi keemat par bhidane par utaaru hai? After a lot of thinking, thinking, what i am understanding and what i am going to explain is not a conversation with a party leader, or the news quoted by a source, but the understanding of a reporter, the reporter who Started covering the movement from day one
 lekin aaj ek raajnneetik party ko cover kar rahaa he
 In fact, after the spectacular performance in Delhi in December 2013, the Aam Aadmi Party was not much interested in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin ek polytical party banaai he to chunaav ladanaa to tha hi isliye shuruyaat main ye tay hua ki party 100 -125 siton par ummidavaar utaaregi, lekin is par sawaal yah tha ki janata aam aadmi party ko kyon chunegi? Because if people will vote for BJP then they will get Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, if people will vote for Congress, maybe Rahul Gandhi can get as Prime Minister, but when common man is fighting only on select seats, organization is not alliance So the principle of the party is not there, so when the AAP government is not formed, then why will the people vote? phir tark yah aayaa ki jis tarah bihar main janata jediu, yaa bengal main trinmul, urisa main biju janata dal , tamilnadu main karunanidhi yaa jayalalita kii party ko vot karke jitati he usee tarah aap ko bhi jita sakati he
 Election should be contested on this logic and people should be told that you should choose us for corruption-free system and look at Delhi as a model, we have given very good governance where our government is
 lekin baat phir yah thi ki ye sab kshetreey dal hai jinka apane rajya se baahar zyaada kuch daanv par nahin he jabaki aap to ek rashtriya party he jisko puure desh main vyavastha badalani he
 That is why the party constantly changed its strategy and now i am telling this story to tell the track that is on
 asal main aam aadmi party sabase pehle khud ko modi ke khilaaf sabase badi- congress se bhi badi- taaqat ke taur par pesh kar, khud ko uskaa vikalp bataakar modi virdohi or bijepi virdohi voton par apana apana daawa majboot karnaa chaahati he
 This can benefit the party in these elections, and in the coming time, it wants to prove itself an alternative to the Congress and replace the Congress
 yani bijepi par hamale ke bahaane aap asal main congress ko hi nuksaan pahunchaayegi
 Even before this, the AAP had won an unprecedented victory in Delhi by mobilizing its support for the traditional voters of the lower strata, illegal colony, slum, etc
 in Delhi
 kejariwal maanate hai ki is samay vaaki modi kii hawa he lekin unase takaraakar or bade paimaane par chunaav ladakar kejariwal koshish kar rahe hai ki loksabhaa chunaav ke bahaane desh main party kaa sanghathan banaaya jaae
 When votes are received, you will know how far the party has influence and how much it is


 Public support will be seen on the pretext of Lok Sabha elections (if any) and after setting up the organization it can be easy to contest assembly elections or local body elections
 upar se jab khud kejariwal modi ke saamne chunaav ladenge to isse ye raay or majboot hogi ki kejariwal ek jaanbaaj or nidar vyakti hai jo us samay modi se sidhaa bhid rahe hai jab shaayad hawa bhi modi ke paksh main bah rahi he
 Earlier, by defeating Delhi's 15-year-old undefeated Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, Kejriwal has made his image like this
 
 
 
 But whether Kejriwal will be able to win from Modi, no one is saying this right now, but when a person fights such a big battle, he wins even in his defeat
 
 
 
 
 janata main ek tarah kii izzat us yoddha ke liye rahati he jo apane se bade yoddha se yuddh karata he
 However, it is not easy for Kejriwal to implement this masterplan because on the one hand they have their own masterplan, on the other hand the leaders and workers of the party have their own plans
 unamem asantosh or naaraazgi badhati ja rahi he jiske alag alag kaaran hai- kisi ko tikat nahin mil rahaa he to koi party ke kaam karne ke tareeke se etraz kar rahaa he, kisi ko congress kii bajaae modi par yun hamalaa pasand nahin aa rahaa he to koi isliye naaraaz he kyonki party main baahar se aakar log sidhe chunaav lard rahe hai yaa sanghathan main badi zimmedaari hasil kar rahe hai or puraane log mauka nahin paa rahe hai
 Anyway, the ideology of the Aam Aadmi Party is not one but a confluence of many ideologies
 zaraa bhi vichaar idhar udhar hote hi aisa kuch ho hi jaataa he ki mere jaise patrkaar ke liye khabar ho jaati he
 There are a lot of questions, but either the party does not have the answers to these questions, or the party is unable to explain the answers to its people properly
 khayr, chunaav main abhi kuch vaqt baaki he
 Let us see what this party will be able to do in the election and whether anything will be done in this party till the election
 aksar bachche ko janm dene ke baad mahilaaon main pet badhane kii samasya bahut aam ho jaati he
 Also, reducing obesity after pregnancy is a bit difficult for women
 kyonki bachche ko janm dene ke baad mahilaon kii body kaaphi kamjor ho jaati he
 Therefore, do not be in a hurry to lose weight and stomach after pregnancy, do not use any medicine, which will have an adverse effect on you and your child's health
 balki aap kuch gharelu upaay kii madad se apana pet kam kar sakati hai
 These measures are safe for both mother and child as well as are very effective
 aise karen pet or vajan kam:1
 Fenugreek seeds are very helpful in reducing stomach
 saath hi yah mahilaon menharmonako santulit rakh kar pet kam karte hai
 Boil 1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds in 1 glass of water at night time
 pani ko halkaa gunaguna hone par pien
 The stomach will reduce quickly
 2
 Breastfeeding the baby
 ek study ke mutabik, stanpan karaane se sharir main maujuud fat cells or calories donon milakar doodh banane kaa kaa kaam tarte hai
 Which reduces weight without doing anything
 3
 Use only hot water for drinking after giving birth
 kyonki garm pani naa keval pet kam karata he balki yah sharir ko motaa hone se bhi bachaata he
 4
 apane pet ko kisi garm kapade yaa belt kii madad se lapet kar rakhen
 It works to bring the stomach to normal size and it also provides relief in back pain after pregnancy
 5
 After pregnancy, cinnamon and cloves are very effective in reducing the stomach
 iske liye 2-3 laung or or aadha chammach dalacheenee ko ubaal kar uske pani ko thanda karke pien
 Soon the stomach will reduce
 6
 Green tea is very beneficial in reducing weight
 yah anti-oxident se bharpoor hoti he
 Also, it does not cause any harm to the health of the child and mother and also reduces weight

 pakistan puri duniya ke saamne kashmir mudde par madad ke liye guhaar laga rahaa he lekin uske haath naakaami hi lagi he
 Now Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will again plead with the US President Donald Trump to interfere in Kashmir
 lekin yahaan bhi pakistan ke mansoobey puure hote nahin dikh rahe hai kyonki afghanistan par america or taliban ke bich shanti vaarta kaa khatm hona uske liye jhatka sabit hua he
 Reports published in the Pakistani media said that international affairs experts believe that the cancellation of talks between the US and the Taliban is a big challenge for Pakistan as it will now face more pressure from the US
 america kaa focus pakistan ke mudde kashmir se zyada afghanistan main jang ke janjaal se khud ko nikaalane par he
 With the cancellation of the peace talks, Zakpakistan played the card of peace in Afghanistan several times
 taliban par uskaa asar mana jaataa he or kaha jaataa he ki taliban ko shanti vaarta kii mej par laane main uski bhoomika rahi he
 It was also considered by the US and in this environment Pakistan did not refrain from threatening that if it does not listen to Kashmir, it will withdraw from its special role in Afghanistan
 lekin, ab america or taliban ke bich shanti vaarta ke dhwast hone ke baad pakistan ke haath se yah trump card jaataa dikh rahaa he or vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa asar uski kashmir muhim par bura padegaa
 Imran Khan has also said in New York that a solution can be found only by talks in Afghanistan

 In such a situation, he is left confused
 antarrashtriya maamalon ke pakistani vishleshak jaahid hossain ne kaha ki pakistan ne in vaartaon (america-taliban vaarta) main apana bahut prayaas lagaaya he
 Its sudden end like this is a major setback for the country
 PAK par padegaa america dawabavarta ke tuutane ke baad ek baar phir america kaa puraa dabaav pakistan par aana tay he jiskaa focus pakistan ke agenda kashmir ke bajaae apane agenda afghanistan main he
 Afghanistan and the United States have long alleged that Pakistan shelters Taliban militants, which Pakistan has denied
 suraksha maamalon ke visheshgy rahimullah yusufajai ne kaha ki vaarta tuutane ke baad ab iske puure asaar hai ki america taliban par lagaam lagane ke liye pakistan par dabaav banayega
 It has once again become a 'try something else' situation for Pakistan as before
 haalanki pakistani sainya visheshgy aaysha siddika maanati hai ki pakistan ke paas abhi bhi khilne ke liye card bache hai
 He said that Pakistan could try to persuade them by talking to the Taliban

 chunavi saal main ye faisla aasaan nahin
 In the 9-year rule of the Railway UPA, the Ministry of Railways has been used to loot political gains and public applause for raising money from the back door
 rail mantri badalte rahe, lekin railway ke halaat nahin badale
 Recently, the railway was estimated to have an additional income of Rs 6600 crore due to increase in fares, but due to increase in the price of diesel, the Railways had to spend two and a half thousand crores more
 sutron kii maane to railway pichley daravaaje se paise jutaney kii jugat main he
 It is believed that by not increasing the fare directly, the price of railway tickets can be increased as fuel surcharge

 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki bajet main 25 nai trainen or 50 se zyada trainon ke pheron ko badhaane kaa elaan ho saktaa hai
 a new Rajdhani train can be run to reduce the waiting list of passengers between Delhi and Mumbai
 bullate train ke sapane ko chhod kar 130 se 200 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar vaali kuch semi hai speed trainon kaa elaan bhi ho saktaa he
 a dozen super Adarsh stations may be announced on the lines of Tilak Terminal in Mumbai

 Some plans related to freight corridors separately for freight can also be announced in this budget
 rail karmchaarion ko behatar prabandhan or suraksha ke gur sikhaane ke liye raibareli yaa amethi main ek prashikshan or shodh santhaan kholane kaa elaan ho saktaa he
 To improve the condition of the railway, the Railway Board can also be expanded in this budget based on the recommendations of the Pitroda Committee and Kakodkar Committee
 rail kanoonon main badlaav kaa bhi ho saktaa he elaagpani jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye railway kul 12 kaarkaanon kii sthapana kar rahaa he
 In most of these factories, 50 to 80 percent of the work has been completed
 chunavi saal main rail mantri in kaarkaanon se utpaadan shuru karana chaahate hai, jisamen raibareli kii rail coach factory bhi he
 About 5 lakh crore is needed to complete the projects announced in the last 15 years
 paise jutaney ke liye or railway ke vikaas main nijee bhagidaaron ko shaamil karne ke liye railway kanoonon main bhi badlaav kiya ja saktaa he taaki mantriyon ke badalane ke baad bhi nijee kshetra ko phayda milane kaa bharosa jage

 aisa lagata he ki congress ke paas raajnneetik mudde nahin bache
 The Congress should consider its own poor quality governance and instead of these baseless allegations, compare its rule with the nda's quality rule

 unhone yah bhi kaha ki nae mantri giriraaj singh ke khilaaf koi maamla nahin he
 Jaitley asked the Congress to compare the quality of misrule given by him to the quality of governance of the NDA government instead of indulging in these baseless allegations
 unhone kaha, 'samprag sarkaar ke dauraan, pradhanmantri kaa mantriparishad ke gathan yaa uske vistaar main kabhi antim faisla nahin hota tha

 The money should be kept there
 peedit parivaar ne ghatana kii soochna police ko de di lekin aparankarta nahin aayaa
 Then the next day asked for money again and told the place and yet he kept moving the family around

 MS Swaminathan, agricultural scientist and chairman of the National Commission for Farmers, praised the agricultural policies of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government at the Center
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne krishi ayog kii kai siforishein lagu kii hai
 In one tweet after another, he praised the Modi government and said that the Center has implemented several recommendations of the farmers commission
 modi sarkaar ne kisaan ayog kii behatar beej, soyal health card, beemaa, sinchit kshetra kii vruddhi ko lagu kiya he
 Swaminathan also praised the efforts by the Modi government to promote the skills of rural women through agricultural universities and the private sector
 gramin mahilaon ne 50% krishi kaary main yogadan diya he
 Special efforts have been made to promote their market skills through agricultural universities and the private sector
 upie kii sarkaar ke dauraan swaminathan ayog ne kisaanon kii haalat ko sudhaarney ke liye kai ahm upayon kii sifarish kii thi, jisamen bhoomi sudhaar, krishi ko samavarti suchi main daale jane ke saath krishi karj kii byaaj dar ko 4 fisadi kiye jane kii sifarish kii thi
 Agricultural loan temporarily required: Swaminathan Swaminathan also said that in the short term, farm loan waiver is necessary as at present the farmer is unable to pay the loan due to fall in prices of agricultural products
 unhone twitor par likhaa he ki haalanki dirghakaal main rin maafee yojana surikshat karj pranali uplabdh nahin karaati kyonki isse krishi buniyadi dhaancha vikaas ke liye paryaapt kosh nahin bachegaa
 It is noteworthy that the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra announced the Agricultural Debt Waiver Scheme
 vahiin madhya pradesh main bhi kisaan yahi maang kar rahe he,
 Swaminathan, the father of the Green Revolution, said, although temporarily loan waiver is necessary but it does not provide for long-term debt system
 iskaa matlab he ki bainkon ko hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai sarkaar karegi
 Debt waiver means that sufficient funds will not be available for agricultural infrastructure
 unhone kaha ki durbhaagya se acchhee barish nahin hone, pichley kuch saal se bheeshan sookhe ke kaaran kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Although the crop is good this year, the farmers are unhappy with the purchase price and are unable to pay the loan taken for institutional and private purposes
 swaminathan ne kaha ki karj kaa punarbhugtan nahin karne se kisaanon ko kharif ke liye nayaa karj nahin milegaa
 That is why they want a fair purchase price along with debt forgiveness

 ) maharashtra main shivasena-ncp-congress gathbandhan sarkaarthakare parivaar ke sir sajega mukhyamantri pad kaa tajmaharashtra main shivasena ke netritv vaali sarkaar banane kaa rasta saaf ho gaya he
 Shiv Sena contested the election by advancing Aditya Thackeray, but now the situation has changed
 bijepi se rishta khatm hone ke baad shivasena ab apane dhur virdohi raajnneetik dalon- congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar bana rahi he
 In this way, the Thackeray family is going to become a king in Maharashtra politics, not a kingmaker
 sharad pavaar jaise rajaneta ke saath samanjasy baitaakar sarkaar chalaanaa or bijepi jaise majboot vipaksh ko saadhane ke maddenjar uddhav thakare ke sir par taj kaanton se kam nahin hoga!shivasena-ncp-congress kii sarkarensipi pramukh sharad pavaar or congress ke diggaj va anbhavi netaaon ke saath gathbandhan sarkaar chalaanaa uddhav thakare ke liye aasaan nahin he
 That too when there is a strong opposition like BJP
 itnaa hi nahin, congress or ensipi aakhir tak aditya ko siem banane ke naam par sahamat nahin hue
 This is the reason why Shiv Sena is betting on making Uddhav Thackeray as CM instead of Aditya
 padhein
 
 live-maharashtra main siyaasi halchal tej, CM ke naam par manthan
 
 
 Uddhav Thackeray can run the government better with allies, he also knows how to deal with strong opposition like BJP
 haalanki yah pehali baar hoga ki jab thakare parivaar kingmekar kii bhoomika chhodkar sidhe satta par kabiz hoga
 In such a situation, the Opposition will directly attack the Thackeray family, this may reduce the status of the Thackeray family and Matoshri, on which the Shiv Sena politics runs
 thakare parivaar ke satta main rahane se ab vipakshi dalon ke liye unako nishaanaa bananaa aasaan hoga
 Thackeray's Sir Sajega cm's crowning fact is that the Thackeray family has a different status and identity in Maharashtra politics and no other family could stand up to them in the state
 isaki ahm vajah yah maani jaati rahi he ki bhale hi satta is parivaar ke aasapaas hi rahi, lekin yah parivaar satta se hameshaa dur rahaa
 Now, for the first time, when the Thackeray family will be in power
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki uddhav thakare siem ke saath-saath shivasena ke mukhiya rahete hai yaa phir aditya ko party kii kaman saunpte hai
 Uddhav Thackeray's political journey The foundation of Shiv Sena was laid in 1966 by Uddhav's father Bala Saheb Thackeray
 jab tak bala sahib thakare raajnneeti main sakriy rahe to uddhav raajnneetik paridrishy se lagbhag dur hi rahe yaa phir unke peeche hi khadey dikhe
 However, Uddhav used to look after the work of Saamna's newspaper Saamna before taking charge of the party and its editor too
 haalanki baad main bal thakare kii badhati umr or kharaab sehat ke kaaran unhone 2000 ke baad party ke kaamkaaj ko dekhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 The victory increased in 2002, the Shiv Sena was a huge success in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections in 2002 and it was attributed to Uddhav Thackeray
 iske baad bal thakare ne apni raajnneetik viraasat uddhav ko saunpi
 In January 2003, Udhav was made the acting president of the Shiv Sena
 kam bolne vaale uddhav thakare ko jab bal thakare ne shivasena ke uttaradhikari ke rup main chunaa to kai logon ko aashcharya hua tha, kyonki party ke baahar log unka naam tak nahin jaanate the or raaj thakare sambhavit uttaradhikari ke rup main jane jate the
 But unhappy with Bal Thackeray choosing his son Uddhav as successor, Raj Thackeray left the party in 2006 and formed a new party - the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena
 uddhav kaa parivaar27 july, 1960 ko mumbai main janme uddhav thakare ke parivaar main patni rashmi thakare ke alaava 2 bete aditya or tejas hai
 His elder son Aditya is active in politics like grandfather and father and is the national president of Yuva Sena, a youth organization of Shiv Sena
 aditya thakare ko shivasena ne aage kar chunaav ladaa tha, lekin nattejey ke baad siyaasi maahaul aise bane ki khud uddhav thakare ko kingmekar se king banane ke liye aage aana pad rahaa he
 The Shiv Sena used to play the elder brother in the NDA in Maharashtra before Narendra Modi came to the center in Maharashtra in 2014, but after that the BJP shifted to the elder brother role there
 2014 main vidhansabha main gathbandhan kii jeet ke baad shivasena apana mukhyamantri nahin bana saki
 Shiv Sena contested 2019 Lok Sabha elections and assembly elections with BJP, but their 25-year-old friendship broke up after their claim to the post of CM
 iske baad shivasena ne congress or ensipi ke saath milakar sarkaar banane kaa faisla kiya he

 unhone kaha, ‘main yah maanata hum ki yah gathbandhan kii baadhyataa se judaa hua nahin he
 i have already said that i respect the decision of the Supreme Court
 ’pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘nishchit rup se main yah maanata hum ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne yah faisla diya he or ek deshbhakt naagarik ke taur par main ise sweekaar karata hum

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has resigned after meeting the Governor
 isi ke saath 20 maheene pehle bana mahagathbandhan bhi tut gaya he
 Nitish Kumar is believed to have the support of the BJP
 agar aisa hota he to nitish kumaar kii mukhyamantri kii kursi bhale batch jaae lekin mahagathbandhan tuutane kaa khamiyaja nitish ko bhugatna padegaa
 1
 nitish bijepi ke samarthan se satta main bane rahenge
 But will he be able to implement his decisions in Bihar with the BJP in the 'modi era'? Because in recent days in the states where the BJP was a partner with the regional parties in power, the regional parties have weakened
 aise main nitish ke saamne bijepi ke saath gathbandhan chalaane ke alaava apni raajnneetik jameen ko bhi barkaraar rakhana ek chunauti hogi
 2
 lalu yadav ke saath bane rahane main nitish kumaar ko ek phayda to jarur tha
 Because of the way Lalu Yadav has been surrounded in many cases of scams, the path of his personal active politics is not easy
 aise main nitish hameshaa argedy ke saath gathbandhan main front foot par hi rahete, or isse lalu ko bhi shaayad koi aapatti nahin hoti
 In the last two years, it has also shown that Lalu Yadav never questioned Nitish's decisions

 The manner in which the government of the Grand Alliance led by Nitish Kumar has fixed a two-year journey in Bihar without any controversy, it also increased Nitish Kumar's stature outside Bihar
 duusare gaiyr-bijepi shasit rajyon main nitish-lalu gathbandhan kii tarah kshetreey partiyaan ek manch par aane kii soch rahi thi, aise main nitish kaa alag hone kaa faisla duusare rajyon main mahagathbandhan kii neenv padane se pehle khatm ho gai he
 This will have an impact especially in Uttar Pradesh
 4
 Apart from regional parties, Congress is also looking towards Nitish with hope, because after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the way the Congress is getting weaker day by day, Nitish's political grip could be strengthened even outside Bihar
 
 yahi nahin, agar bijepi or narendra modi ke mukaable main khulkar nitish saamne aate to unhen tamaam kshetreey dalon ke saath-saath congress kaa bhi saath mil saktaa tha
 He could also have been a candidate for the post of PM than Modi

 Even though there are 80 mlas from Azerbaijan in Bihar, Lalu Yadav kept trying to save the Grand Alliance till the last moment
 haalanki wo philhal tejasvi ke istife par samjhaute se inkaar kar rahe the
 But he knew that if Nitish parted from the alliance, the political existence of RJD could be questioned
 lekin ye bhi sach he ki aaj se 2 saal pehle jis tarah se jediu-argedy ke alag hone se bijepi kii takat badi thi, or lalu ke saath-saath nitish ke raajnneetik bhavishya par bhi khantra mandaraane laga tha
 In such a situation, Nitish's separation from Lalu can be a big and dangerous decision

 How far has the ongoing CBI investigation in this case reached? Why are the accused mlas still in BJP? Why laxity in protection of victims and witnesses? Without answering these questions, can any expectation of justice be expected from BJP government? If Unnao wants a rape victim, his government is ready to conduct a CBI inquiry into the Rae Bareli case

 Venkaiah Naidu has said that these two were like his real siblings
 uparashtrapati ne kaha he ki inke nidhan se unhone mahaj 10 dinon ke bheetar do behtareen dost kho die hai
 The vice-president has stated that both were among the best mps of the day, qualified administrators and skilled speakers
 ek akhbaar main likhe lekh main donon kii tulana karte hue uparashtrapati ne kaha he ki donon main kai samanthaayen thi, samanta is lihaaj se kii donon ne apni-apni aakshamata se ladaaiyaan ladiin
 The Vice President has written that while Reddy defeated physical disability, Sushma Swaraj defeated social disability
 venkaiya naidu likhte hai, "langik bhedbhaav aaj bhi hamaare saamaajik-raajnneetik jivan main ek bada masalaa he, jisase mahilaon ko kai mushkilon se jujhna padataa he, magar sushamaa swaraj ne ise nakaar diya, jaipal kii tarah unhone bhi apane shabdon, karmon or uplabdhiyon se durjey saamaajik baadhaon ko paar kiya
 "naidu says that despite being born in the conservative social system of Haryana, becoming the youngest cabinet minister and then becoming the first foreign minister to complete his term is no small feat
 bataa den ki sushamaa swaraj ke antim sanskaar ke dauraan jab uparashtrapati lodhi road sthit shavadah grih pahunche to sushamaa ke parthiv sharir ke saamne ve fafik-fafik kar ro pade
 Remembering Sushma in the Rajya Sabha, she said that she considered him her elder brother and called her Anna
 venkaiya ne kaha ki sushamaa har saal raksha bandhan par unhen raakhi baandhti thi, lekin is saal unki kalai suuni rahegi
 In his article Venkaiah Naidu has written that when he went to pay last respect to Sushma, his daughter flute started crying
 uparashtrapati ne is lekh main bansuri ke saath apane samvaad ko yaad kiya
 He said that Sushma used to tell her daughter, "whenever i meet Venkaiah, i get worried, because a sister like my elder brother gets relieved by telling all the problems, in the same way i meet him out of my troubles
 Coming out, "venkaiah Naidu continues," cruel destiny snatched an affectionate sister from me
 "venkaiya kehete hai ki jaipal reddy or sushamaa swaraj kii vakstyle bhagwaan kii di hui thi
 He said that while Jaipal Reddy had an extraordinary hold on the English language, Sushma Swaraj's clarity of expression and understanding of her Indian culture made her a great orator

 At the same time, Kumaraswamy won two assembly seats
 lihaaja bijepi rajyapal ke jariye dabaav banaaegi ki kumaraswami vishwaas mat se pehle do main se ek seat se istipha den
 BJP wants Kikarnataka Governor Vajubhai to be the largest party ie BJP to invite government and give time to prove majority in assembly
 vidhansabha main vishwaas mat ke dauraan congress or jedies ke kam se kam 15 vidhayakon ko gaiyr hajir rakhane kii planning he
 This will reduce the strength of the house from 222 to 207
 iske baad bijepi apane 104 vidhayakon ke dam par aasaani se bahumat sabit kar legi
 The magic figure of the majority will come down to 104 from 112
 itnaa hi nahin, bijepi kii koshish lingayat sammaan ko bhi mudda banane kii he
 If sources are to be believed, BJP is in touch with the Lingayat mlas of Congress
 iske liye party lingayat mathon se sampark saadh rahi he, jisase lingayat samudaay ke vidhayak yediurppa ke sampark main aa jaaen

 haalanki jab yah gaanaa market main aayaa tha to log iske bol ko kaaphi ajeeb bataa rahe the or isi vajah se logon ne is gane ko khub suna
 Speaking of Nigerian singer Samuel Singh, he had cancer in one hand, due to which he had to be separated from his body
 ab vah nai tarkeeb apanaate hue aise gane ko apana varjan de rahe hai
 Apart from India, he is also well liked in Nigeria
 ise abhi tak kareeb 9 lakh baar dekha ja chukaa he
 He has released this song on his official youtube channel
 samual singh na sirf bhojpuri gane kii rimek karte hai balki bollywood or punjabi gane kaa bhi rimek song apane andaaj main banaate hai
 Recently, he made a remake of Punjabi singer Kamal Kahlon and Param Singh's song 'daru Badnaam'
 itnaa hi nahin, jab ek concert main neha kakkad nigeria pahunchi thi to uskaa live video bhi apane utyub par share kiya tha
 Bhavik Bansal has become the top ranker in the top medical entrance examinations of the country, back-to-back
 ames embibies kii pravesh pariksha main wo number van rahe to neet main unhen duusari rank mili
 The special thing in Bhavik's success is that like the rest of the top students in medical and engineering, Bhavik has not been top rankers since the beginning
 enditivi se baatcheet main bhavik bataate hai ki dasvin tak wo kabhi apane skool yaa class main first nahin aaye
 Yes, there was a lot of change in Bhavik's attitude towards studies from XI
 vajah ye thi ki 11veen main unhen apni man pasand kaa vishay chunane kaa mauka mila or phir wo acha karne lage
 Bhavik says that he would set small targets for himself and fulfill them
 par yahaan aapako yah bhi dhyaan rakhana he ki agar aapkaa lakshya medical pravesh pariksha he or aap 12veen main bahut achche marks nahin bhi laa paae to use aap apni pratishtha se mat jodiye
 Sharing his strategy about preparing for AIIMS and NEET, Bhavik says that in preparation for both, you need some basic attention
 neet main aap pichley saalon ke sawaal kii tarah ke sawaal aane kii ummid kar sakate hai par ames main isaki ummid mat kijiye
 In AIIMS, you have to be more creative and for this there should be a very good command on theory
 haa agar neet karnaa he to aapako wo sawaal to karnaa hi he jo pichley saalon main aaye hai
 Even if you understand how difficult AIIMS questions are, you will not get much help from previous years questions
 kyonki jo sawaal aapke paas aate hai wo yaad par aadhaarit hote hai or is baat ki bahut kaam gunjaaish he ki usamen sawaalon ko sahi tareeke se pesh kiya gaya ho
 Bhavik says that if you want to do AIIMS then you should also take recourse to JEE books and previous years questions
 neet ke lihaaz se agar aapaki baology kii taiyaari he to phir ames ke liye physics or chemistry par or adhik mehnat karne kii zarurat he
 Going into detail on physics strategy, Bhavik says that 70-80 percent of the questions are asked in AIIMS from 12th, but the special thing is that it seems that the questions are being asked from modern physics but there are concepts of mechanics in it
 Are also engaged
 yani agar aapke concepts bahut achche nahin he to us tarah ke sawaal ko hal karnaa mushkil hoga
 Now if we talk about chemistry, Bhavik believes that NCERT is not enough to solve AIIMS questions
 bhavik ne argenic chemistry ke liye emes chouhan kii kitaab kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Apart from this, Bhavik believes that it is also beneficial to question JEE Mains
 agar baat karen physical chemistry kii to ye aasaan ho jaayegaa agar aapane pehle hi physics ko achche se pard liya he
 Biology is very much like NEET and most of the questions come from NCERT
 ab keval padhai se thodaa hat kar baat karen to bhavik apane bare main ek dilachasp baat bataate hai jo adhiktar topper main aapako nahin milegi
 Bhavik says that he cannot stay away from the phone for more than 5 minutes and even during the medical entrance examination, Bhavik used a smart phone
 par haa, is par wo apana time karaab nahin karte the balki kathin sawaalon ko apane doston ke saath share karte or use chalange ke rup main lete
 Bhavik says that you do not need to pay too much attention to current affairs
 khaskar bahut saare log kehete hai ki neet ke baad ames ke liye 20 din kaa vaqt hota he usamen karant afares dekh lenaa chahie par bhavik kii salaah he ki in dinon main bhi aapako physics par zyada dhayaan dena chahie
 Bhavik, a resident of Delhi, is now preparing to move to AIIMS Delhi

 verma ne bataaya ki vah ishwar or bhartiya bachaav dal ke shukraguzaar hai ki soni or team ke anya sadsy apane ghar surakshit waapas laut aae
 Referring to the performance at the Asian Football Championship in Kathmandu, Soni said that the only goal he scored was the Indian team's 1-1 tie with the Bangladesh team

 inputah bhashaa Protests over the Lok Sabha elections continue in the camp
 uttar pradesh kii 80 loksabhaa siton par mahagathbandhan kii partiyon ke bich daavedaari ko lekar jabardast halchal machi hui he
 First came the news that everything has been decided between the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party regarding seat sharing in the state and both have agreed to fight together in an alliance
 is bich uttar pradesh ke congress adhyaksh raaj babbar ne maamle par chuppi todate hue kaha he ki sapa or basapa ke gathbandhan ko lekar abhi donon main se kisi bhi party ne aupchaarik taur par elaan nahin kiya he
 He also said that the Congress state will prepare for all 80 Lok Sabha seats
 raaj babbar ne kaha ki donon partiyon ke bich gathbandhan kii baat sirf afvaah he or kuch nahin
 He said, 'how many years has it been since Akhilesh Yadav's government came to power
 mujhe yakeen he ki is par wo acha vaktavy denge
 So far no stake holder has said anything about seat sharing
 abhi tak jo bhi baaten saamne ai hai wo sirf sutron ke hawaale se kahi ja rahi hai jo ki purna rup se afvaah hai
 According to media reports, on Friday, a long meeting was held between Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati
 sutron ke mutabik is baithak main donon ne kareeb 71 siton par sahmati jataai
 According to sources, in this meeting it was decided that SP can contest on 35 Lok Sabha seats of the state and BSP on 36 Lok Sabha seats
 vahiin, rashtriya lokdal ko 3 siten dene or 4 siton ko rigerv rakhane kii baat tay hui
 It was also said that in this meeting both of them agreed with Amethi and Rae Bareli not to field their candidates
 haalanki, congress ne aise kisi bhi gathbandhan kii ashanka ko khaarij kar diya he or kaha he ki abhi donon main se kisi bhi party ne pratyaksh rup se gathbandhan or seat shering ke formule kii baat nahin kii he
 Let me tell you that the day before, Rajya Sabha MP and Samajwadi Party General Secretary Ram Gopal Yadav also said that he is not aware of any compromise between SP and BSP
 unhone kaha ki unhen nahin pataa ki donon netaaon ke bich baatcheet hui bhi he yaa nahin
 Sa Ramgopal Yadav said that if there is any announcement, it will be done by Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav
 congress pravaktaa akhilesh pratap singh ne is mudde par india today se baat karte hue kaha ki jo bhi gathbandhan banegaa wo bijepi ke khilaaf banegaa, kyonki desh parivartan chahta he
 Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said that the uneasiness of forming an alliance between SP and BSP is becoming evident
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki 2014 aam chunaav main mayawati ke netritv main basapa ko ek bhi seat par jeet hasil nahin hui thi
 He said that the Samajwadi Party had also won only 5 seats from Saifai, which belonged only to the people of his family
 saath hi congress bhi keval gandhi parivaar vaali do siten hi jeet pai thi
 In such a situation, there is uneasiness among all these parties as to how to defeat the Modi government at the center
 lekin pradhanmantri ke mukaable main vipaksh ke paas koi cheharaa nahin he
 He said that the opposition has neither leadership nor fixed so this alliance will fail completely

 Has been made the interim president of the Indian Youth Congress
 vah keshav chand yadav kii jagah lenge, jinhen 11 may, 2018 ko kaarybhaar saunpa gaya tha
 Srinivas was earlier the National Vice President of the Indian Youth Congress
 keshav chand yadav se pehle, amarinder singh raja saadhe teen saal tak yuva congress ke pramukh rahe
 He was appointed the head of Youth Congress in December 2014
 loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad congress main pherbadal kaa daur jari he
 Rahul Gandhi resigned from the post of Speaker after the defeat in the parliamentary elections
 idhar, punjab ke mukhyamantri amarinder singh ne agar congress adhyaksh ke taur priyanka gandhi wadra ko chunaa jaataa he to unhen sabhi kaa samarthan milegaa
 He regretted Rahul Gandhi's decision to quit the party's top post
 congress netaa shashi tharur ke bayaan par ki priyanka party pramukh ke taur par ek acha chayan hongi, pratikriya maange jane par unhone kaha, bharat ek yuva raashtra he or yah yuva netaa se judaav mahasoos karegaa
 Amarinder Singh said, "priyanka would be the right choice to take over the reins of the party, but it all depends on the Congress Working Committee (CWC), which is authorized to take a decision in the matter
" "mukhyamantri pehle bhi party kaa prabhaar sanbhaalane ke liye yuva netaa kii vakaalat kar chuke hai
 He had said that majority of the population of India is now youth, only a young leader can join the people
 ek anya sawaal ke jawaab main amarinder ne yah saaf kiya ki priyanka party pramukh banane ke liye sarvatha upyukt hai
 After the defeat of the recent Lok Sabha elections, a dynamic young leader is needed to rebuild the party
 gujarat main 2002 main hue dange atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar par 'sambhavat: sabase bada dhabba' the or iske kaaran hi 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 This is what former President Pranab Mukherjee believes
 apni aatmakatha 'da coalishan iers 1996-2012' ke tisare sanskaran main unhone likhaa he, '(vaajapeyi sarkaar kii) is puri avadhi main ayodhya main ram mandir ke nirmaan kii maang jor pakadati rahi
 The increased communal tension had a very bad effect in Gujarat, which was seen as communal riots in 2002
 ''vaajapeyi sarkaar par laga sabase bada dhabba'mukherjee ne adhyay 'first phul turm non congress government' main likhaa he, 'godhra main dange shuru hue, jisamen sabarmati express ke ek dibbe main lagi aag main 58 log jalakar khaak ho gaye
 All the victims were Hindu Karsevaks returning from Ayodhya
 issegujaratke kai shaharon main bade paimaane par dange bhadak uthe the
 Perhaps this was the biggest blot on the Vajpayee government, due to which the BJP probably suffered in the upcoming elections
 ''ek utkrisht saansad the vaajapeyi'mukherjee ne kaha ki vaajapeyi ek utkrisht saansad rahe hai
 He has also been a great orator with a great grasp on the language
 vaajapeyi tatkaal hi logon ke saath jud jane or unhen saath le aane kii kala main maahir rahe hai
 At that time, in politics, Vajpayee was getting the trust of the people and in the process he was earning the respect of his party, allies and opponents in the country
 vahiin, videsh main unhone bharat kii sauhardrapurn chhavi pesh kii or apni videsh niti ke jariye desh ko duniya se joda
 Vajpayee, an influential and humble politician, always credited his works to others
 'sudhaar kii shuruyaat congress ne nahin kii'adhyay ke anusaar, 'sudhaar kii shuruyaat hamane nahin kii
 We are carrying forward the process initiated by the Narasimha Rao government and continued by the two United Front governments
 lekin ham sudhaar prakriya ko vyapak or gaharaa banane or ise gati dene kaa shrey avashya lete hai
 According to Mukherjee, Vajpayee never took political rivalry personally
 '2004 ke nateezon ne aashcharyachakit kiya'unka kahana he ki 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav parinaam ke baad congress phir se satta main aa gai
 The victory of the Congress and several other non-bjp parties surprised many
 kai chunaav vishleshkon ne rajg kii spasht jeet kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 The India today-org-marg survey in February 2004 predicted a clear victory for the Vajpayee-led coalition

 aise main prashasan ke liye sabase badi chunauti hogi ghanghor naksal prabhavit ilaake 'bijapur ke jangla' main piem kii sabha main sthaneey adivaasiyon kii bheed jutanaa
 But the local tribals will face a bigger challenge than this administration challenge
 aisa isliye kyonki prashasan apni puri takat sabha main bheed jutaney main lagayegaa to udhar naksali sabha main bheed na ikattha hone ke liye apana puraa dam jhonk denge
 Local tribals will be caught in this nourishment of administration and Naxalites
 chhattisgarh kaa daura kitna khatarnaak he iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki rajya main 12 iees or 24 ipies adhikariyon ne pradhanmantri kii suraksha ko lekar bastar main abhi se deraa daal liya he
 The administration is ready to protect them
 12 april ko jangla main vanmantri mahesh gagada, do diiji or anya kai adhikari ne kai ghante suraksha vyavastha ke nirikshan main bitaye
 There has also been a stir in the Red Corridor
 bijapur main jagah-jagah sarkaar virdohi or khaastaur par pradhanmantri virdohi parche chipke mil rahe hai
 The orders to boycott the Prime Minister's meeting are being issued by the Naxalites by holding meetings from place to place
 aise main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sabha main bheed jutaney kii prashasan ke saamne kathin chunauti hogi
 But the local tribals will undergo a tough ordeal
 ve prashasan kii maanakar agar sabha main gaye to naksaliyon kaa gussa un par phutegaa or nahin gaye to prashasan kii naaraazgi jhelni padegi
 The Prime Minister's visit has been opposed in these leaflets sticking from place to place
 'go back, go back modi' or 'yahaan na rashtrawaad chalegaa or na modi' jaise shlogan likhe gaye hai
 It is also being reported from the sources that the Naxalites have issued a decree to boycott the pm's meeting
 sabhaayen karke gaanv waalon ko chetavanee di ja rahi he ki agar pradhanmantri kii sabha main gaye to 'janatanaa sarkaar' unhen sajaa degi
 Janatana government or courts i
e
 Naxalites have their own private government and courts
 darasal pradhanmantri ne daure ke liye bijapur ke janglaa ilaake ko yah sandesh dene ke liye chunaa he ki ve naksaliyon dwaara failaae gaye khauf ko chunauti dene main sakasham hai
 Stunned by this challenge to the fear of the Red Corridor, the Naxalites tried unsuccessfully to carry out the incident by planting the Sarkeguda IED of Bijapur on 11 April
 yahi nahin isse pehle 9 april ko bijapur main kuvenaar or tumnar ke bich naksaliyon ne javaanon se bhari bas ko iidi blast se uda diya
 Two soldiers were killed and six were injured in this
 pradhanmantri kii suraksha ke liye prashasan ne abhed suraksha gheraa to bana liya
 But the security of the local tribals is in danger
 idhar prashasan pradhanmantri kii sabha main sthaneey logon kii bheed jutaney ke lakshya ko puraa karne kii bharsak koshish karegaa, udhar naksali sabha main bheed na jutane dene kii koshash karenge
 In such a situation, local tribals will grind between the orders of the Naxalites and the appeal of the administration
 ab aise main sarkaar or naksaliyon ke bich main varshon se pisate aa rahe adivaasiyon ke liye in donon main se kisi ek kii bhi nafarmaani baari padegi
 According to a local source of Sukma, if the Janata does not come to the meeting, then the Jangla residents will have to bear the anger of the army personnel posted there and if they join the meeting then the Janatana government will not leave
 naksal vichaar dhara par chalate hi naksali kisi bhi sarkari yojana kaa laabh lene ke khilaaf gaanvon main aaj bhi farmaan jari karte hai
 At present, the tribals still take ration wherever the army is stationed
 lekin jangalon ke bheetar padane vaale ilaakon main aaj bhi yahi haal he
 People are still afraid of taking government ration in areas like Jangla
 aise main sarkari vyakti vah bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke daure kii khabar se naksali tilamila gaye hai
 Still, if the local people even try to attend the meeting, then they may have to pay damages
 janatanaa adaalaton kaa sach adivaasiyon kii jubaninksli bharat sarkaar yaa rajya sarkaar kii sansthaaon ko nahin maanate
 They run their own government
 jahaan unki apni adaalatein hoti hai
 Justice has its own way

 The verdict is on the spot
 dantewada ke ek gaanv samali paara main kareeb 60 varshiya sanaaraam ne in adaalaton ke bare main kuch aise bataaya
 'punishment of crime in these courts is very dangerous
 jeebh kaat lenaa, haath kaat dena, saare aam faansee par lataka dena, galaa ret dena aam aam baat he
 These sentences are not heard in these courts but are given immediately
 ' usee gaanv ke ek duusare vyakti ne kaha, 'mukhabiri kaa shaq agar kisi gaanv vaale par ho jaae to phir uski sidhe hatya kii jaati he
 The corpse is put to rot in the village square so that the villagers remain in awe
 'jab se sena tainaat hui tab se andar waalon kaa baahar ke gaanvon main aana janaa band ho gaya he
 But the villages inside still live under the same Janatana governments
 vahaan andar waalon kaa hi shashan chalata he
 Sanaram says, these people call the Janatana courts to be called the people's court
 lekin yahaan janata keval mookadarshak hokar dekhati or sunati he
 They also have charges and the punishment also determines the same
 kisi chote-mote aarope main ped se baandhakar dandon se saream peetna inaki sabase kam krur sajaa he

 Iraq is burning again in a fire of terror, because the world's most dreaded bed is writing such an article from the slaughterhouse on its land that if it succeeds in its plan, then the world map will change
 wo rajdhani baghdad se sirf 400 kilometre kii duuri par he or philhal use rokane kii takat kisi ke paas nahin he
 What is that bed after all? Who is that problem? Who has threatened the existence of Iraq as a country? In fact, in the other words Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, the Islamic State of the Iraq and the Levant, the world's richest terrorist organization, is a person who now has a fear of terror for Iraq as well as all North African countries
 Has become the biggest name
 lekin ab sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhir iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne iraq ko is tarah kyon gheraa he? akhir kyon iesas ke khadku iraqi fouj ko gaajar-muuli kii tarah katate hue aage bad rahe hai? or pichley chand dinon main kaise is sanghathan ke aatankwaadiyon ne teen iraqi shahar faluja, tirakit or mosul ko kabje main kabje main le liya he?to in sawaalon ke jawaab bhi kam chaunkaanewaale nahin hai
 In fact, ISIS is a terrorist organization that wants to establish its rule in the name of Islam in many countries, including Iraq, and has now captured a large part of Iraq in an effort
 haalat ye he ki is desh main mache is ghamaasan kii badaulat jahaan 5 lakh log apane hi mulk main beghar hokar sharnaarthi kii zindagi ji rahe hai, vahiin saikadon log apni jaan se haath dho chuke hai
 According to current reports, ISIS militants armed with all the latest weapons first captured the Iraqi city of Faluja and then on Tiraqit, even then there was a lot of money, but now the extent is that the terrorists after Baghdad, Iraq's largest city And it has also captured Mosul, just 400 km from Baghdad
 rocket laancharon se hamalaa karte, tinkon se raundte or tabadatod goliyaan barasaate is sanghathan ke aatankwaadi ab ab iraq main failane lage hai
 Due to this, the dead bodies are lying in the midst of death ordeal on the streets of Iraq, as a country, Iraq is constantly weakening
 abu bakar al bagdadi hi he, jisaki rahanumai main iesas ke aatankwaadi iraq ko nestonabud karne main jute hai
 This is the reason why the US State Department has announced a total reward of US $ 10 million to the person who gave the living or dead address of this person
 ye rakam al javaahari ke sir par rakhi gaye america inaam yani 25 million yues dollar ke baad duusari sabase badi rakam he
 Although the stories of Abu Bakr al-baghdadi's quintessence are long, but this time the way he has held half of Iraq hostage is his biggest bet ever
 ye abu bakar al bagdadi hi he, jisaki aguwai main iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne naa sirf iraq ke duusare bade shahar mosul ko apane kabje main kar liya, balki isi silsile main mosul ke central bank ko lut kar is duniya kii sabade badi bank lut kaa itihaas bhi apane naam kar liya
 On 16 May 2010, as the head of ISIS, Baghdadi, who commanded this world's richest terrorist organization, has already been the commander of Al Qaeda commander Osama bin Laden
 logon ko yaad he ki kis tarah laden kii maut ke baad usne naa sirf iskaa badla lene kii baat kahi thi, balki iraq samet tamaam levent mulkon yani cyprus, isroyal, jordan, lebanon, syria, philistin or turki ko milakar ek islamic mulk banane kaa elaan kiya tha
 But his intention would be broken every day by wreaking havoc on Iraq, it was not even known to Iraq itself, but Baghdadi has been not only far ahead in its target, but the Iraqi community is being massacred with the intention of occupying Iraq
 Along with this, it is starting to prove to be a headache for the whole world
 aresas ne mumbai main shivasena kii ore se haalia virodh kii ghatnaon, bharat main alpsankhyakon ko lekar pakistan kii ore se jataai gai chintaa or lekhakon ke sammaan waapas karne ko ek hi khaanche main rakhte hue kaha he ki ve sab ‘modi phobia’ paidaa karne or apni ‘sambhddha jagahon ko surakshit rakhane’ ke liye virodh kar rahe hai
 rss's weekly magazine Organizer said that the common goal of the nature of protests by the authors and Pakistan is to create 'phobias' against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 shivasena or pakistan ke kaamon kaa zikraiske sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘ham desh bhar main alag-alag virodh dekh rahe hai jisamen modi kii aguwai vaali endie sarkaar kii dharmik sahishnutaa or abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko lekar uske pichley record kii aalochana kii ja rahi he
 The Shiv Sena, a political ally of the BJP in Mumbai, protested against the release of the book by Pakistani leader Kasuri
 pakistan ne bharat main ‘badhati ashishnutaa’ or alpsankhyak adhikaron ke darje ko lekar chintaa jataai he
 The issue of Dadri violence was also raised, the newspaper said, "some eminent litterateurs have returned their awards, expressing anger over the attack on freedom and the secular fabric of India
" ye virodh apane vishyon main bhinn dikhaai de sakate hai lekin unki manshaa samaan he
 Modi phobiapaad to protect your place
 ’ patrika ne dadri main gohatya ke andeh main ikhlaaq kii peet-petakar hatya karne ke virodh main puraskaar lautaane kii bhartiya lekhakon main chalane vaali baghawat kii lahar ko nishane par liya he
 So this is the aim of Shiv Sena's protest? RSS publication went further and accused the protesting authors of promoting 'ideological intolerance'
 usne kaha ki aise log hinduon ke bare main baat karne vaale prayek vyakti par ‘hindutvaadi takaton’ kaa tamgaa laga dete hai
 It was pointed out that Kasuri's opposition to Shiv Sena can be understood as he had done the same in the past and it is inspired by the municipal elections in Mumbai
 lekin yah pareshaan karne vaali baat he prakhyat sahityakar or buddhijivi bhi usee tarah se prayaas kar rahe hai jis tarah se shivasena or pakistan kar rahe hai
 Television is also following the pattern of Hollywood
 jis tarah helivin ke maukey par vahaan horer or rahasy romaanch se bharpoor filmon or netflix (netflix) par siries kii baadh aa jaati he, vaisaa hi in dinon televijan par bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
