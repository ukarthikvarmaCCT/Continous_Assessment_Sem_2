kohli kii captaini main bharat ne pichley saal srilanka ko 2-1 or dakshin africa ko 3-0 se haraaya tha
 No pitch in West Indies Easy West Indies pitches have slowed down, so the challenge is not as easy
 practice match ke dauraan pich main oochaal dekhne ko mila lekin isse tej gendbaajon ko koi madad nahin mil saki balki spinners ko turn milane lagi
 Light grass appears on the pitch but it seems that the pitch will not be unbreakable for five days
 team ke sadasyon or sahyogi staff ne bhi kaha he ki thodi si ghaas se bhi wicket kaa dhimaapan nahin jayega lihaaja samajha jaataa he ki stuart binni par amit mishra ko tarjeeh di jaaegi
 With Kohli already making it clear that he will play with five bowlers, it will be interesting to see who is picked from Mohammad Shami and Umesh Yadav as the most experienced Test cricketer Ishant Sharma in the team
 bench strength badhayenge rohit sharmapanch gendbaajon ko utaarne ke myne hai ki rohit sharma ko phir baahar rahanaa hoga jo duusare practice match main bhi nahin khel sake the
 He was one of the five players to take part in the optional practice session two days before the Test
 unke alaava binni, mishra, cheteshwar pujaara or keel rahul ne practice kiya
 Mishra will get preference over both Rohit and Binny
 team prabandhan yadi tisare number par rahul kii jagah pujaara ko utaarata he to yah achraj kii baat hogi
 Pujara and Rahul practiced together on the net while Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan were seen practicing on the other net
 net practice se team combination kaa kayaas lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Pujara scored just 33 in six innings after landing at number three in four Tests against South Africa
 66 kii ausat se ran banaae
 It was nine months ago and since then Rahul is in good form having made half-centuries in both practice matches here
 anubhavheen he westeindies kii timwestindies ke paas derren braavo or sampuls ke rup main do hi anbhavi khilaadi hai jo kramash: 42 or 64 test khel chuke hai
 Captain Jason Holder will expect two of his senior batsmen to lead from the front
 anubhavheen ballebaaji kram main germein blackwood (15 test) or rajendra chandrika (teen test) bhi hai
 Blackwood impressed in both innings of the second practice match but it would not be easy to play three Indian spinners during the Test
 aise main braavo or sampuls par kaaphi jimmedaari hogi
 The West Indies have the only spinner in the form of Devendra Bishoo while the fast bowling front will be handled by Shannon Gabriel, Migul Cummins, Kalres Brathwaite and himself
 timen:bharatkaviraat kohli (captain), murali vijay, shikhar dhawan, keel rahul, cheteshwar pujaara, ajinkya rahane, rohit sharma, ridhimaan saaha, aar aswin, amit mishra, ravindra jadeja, stuart binni, bhubaneshwar kumaar, mohammad shami, shardul thakur, umesh yadav or eshanth sharma

 na vah star rahaa, na wo izzat rahi or na wo shoharat
 There is a similar story of Pakistani fast bowler Mohammad Aamir who came under the spot fixing
 2009 main debyue karne ke baad maatr 1 saal ke andar hi aamir ne dhooma machaa di
 With 51 wickets in 14 Tests, he became the youngest bowler to take 50 wickets
 vahiin 15 vanade maichon main unhone 25 wicket bhi jatke
 But Mohammed Aamir's world shattered when he was accused of fixing the spot
 aarope sabit bhi hua or unhen na sirf 6 maheene kii jail kii sajaa hui balki un par 5 saal kaa pratibandh bhi lag gaya
 It was as if an eclipse had struck a glowing star
 lekin tamaam chizon ko peeche chhodkar mohammad aamir dobaaraa cricket kii duniya main dhooma machaane waapas aa rahe hai
 He is currently playing grade-2 cricket in Pakistan after being granted permission by the International Cricket Council (ICC)
 vaapasi karte hue apane pehle hi match main aamir hetric ke kagaar par the, lekin wo chook gaye
 From the speed and speed at which he was seen bowling, it seems that he is going to come back stronger and stronger
 apana bain khatm karne ke baad jabase aamir maidan par laute hai lagaataar behatar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 He has bowled 22 wickets in 4 matches
 haalanki international cricket main vaapasi karne ke liye abhi aamir ko intjaar karnaa padegaa
 Because their ban expires on 2 September 2015
 pakistan cricket board ke aagrah par isisi ne aamir ko philhal sirf gharelu cricket main khilne kii ijaajat di he
 There is a possibility of a series between India and Pakistan in December this year
 aise main yah puche jane par ki kya vah bharat ke khilaaf siries khelnaa chahenge
 So Aamir said that playing against India is every Pakistani's dream, and i will also try my best to return to my national team again
 haalanki maatr 18 saal kii umr main spot phixing jaise sangeen jurm main fanse aamir ke liye vaapasi itani aasaan nahin rahane vaali he
 He was at the peak of his form when he was banned
 aamir ke saamne sabase pehali chunauti us tarah kii fitness or parformens dubaara hasil karne kii he
 Also, critics and fans may have to fall prey to them
 kyonki jis tarah ke gunaah kii sajaa vah katkar aa rahe hai usase unhen kai tarah ke tikhe caments kaa bhi saamana karnaa padegaa
 However, there is no denying that whatever Aamir did was not good
 lekin is baat ko bhi koi jhuthla nahin saktaa ki aamir kisi ke bahekaave main aakar hi wo jurm kar baithe
 Former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding also believes that a fledgling player who hails from a modest village cannot go to England and commit a crime like spot-fixing
 holding yah kehete hue lagbhag rone hi vaale the ki is jabardast tallent ko kisi ne barbaad kar diya
 However, what had to happen has been done
 ab intjaar he aamir ke international cricket main vaapasi kii
 If Aamir returns mentally strong, there is no doubt that he can once again shine his glow in the cricket field
 lekin agar puraani chizon ko vah apane dimag se nahin nikaal paae, to ho saktaa he ki ek or sitara gardish main chalaa jaae

 a post shared by Vin Diesel (@vindiesel) on Feb 10, 2017 at 8:09 pm PST pakistan ne seemaa rekha kaa ulanghan kar bhartiya sena ke jawan maar die, magar somvaar raat ke is vaakye par desh ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh abhi tak chuppi saadhe hue hai
 Questioning this, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley has said that the defense minister is lightening the truth in his statement and the PM is keeping silence, there are some indications of this
 nahin bakhshenge antni cojetali ne saaf kiya ki hamaare nishane par sirf raksha mantri eke antni hi nahin balki puri sarkaar he
 According to him, the army gave a statement that the Pakistani army attacked
 is sach ko raksha mantri ne badal diya or apane bayaan main kaha ki hamalavar keval pakistani sena kii vardi main the
 Similarly, the second statement was that this incident happened with LOC
 phir badalakar kah diya ki bhartiya territary main hua
 Jaitley said, taking advantage of this, Pakistan has made defense
 ve kahenge ki aapaki seemaa main hua he, seemaa paar nahin hui to aapke mujahidin rahe honge
 According to Jaitley, giving this rescue route is not understandable
 pakistan ko sharminda karogetli ne saaf kiya ki antni yaa sarkaar kaa rukh koi galati nahin he
 According to him, the government is deliberately lightening its statement, its stand
 unhone kaha ki kal ek mauka tha jab sarkaar saaf taur par pakistan kaa naam lekar use puri duniya ke saamne sharminda karti
 But this did not happen
 sarkaar ko apana stand desh ke saamne saaf karnaa hoga
 Union Finance Minister P
 chidambaram ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki bhartiya janata party (bijepi) gujarat main sarkaar bana sakati he lekin rajya main vaastavik vijeta congress he
 While BJP is moving towards victory in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly, Chidambaram said that bjp's attraction has shrunk in Gujarat
 unhone media se kaha, 'yah sach he ki bijepi is myne main jiti he ki vah rajya main sarkaar banaaegi
 "he said," But the real winner is the Congress, which is going to win more seats here than in 2007
 congress ke sandesh ne adhik matadaataaon ko aakarshith kiya
 In contrast, Chidambaram said that BJP is expected to win about 117 seats this year as well
 paanch saal pehle bhi use itani hi siten mili thim
 He said, 'bjp's base has shrunk, even if it has shrunk a bit
 ' Former Syrian Prime Minister Riyadh Hijab, who switched sides and joined hands with the rebels, claimed that President Bashar al-assad's regime now controls only 30 per cent of the country

 During the assembly elections, one night hosting of former Chief Minister and BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa cost him dearly
 indrani naam kii mahila ke is parivaar ko yediurppa ne raat guzarkar lokapriy bana diya, lekin iske saath yah parivaar karj ke boj se dab gaya
 BJP leader Yeddyurappa stayed in a house during the last assembly elections in Laxmipura slum area of bengaluru Central Constituency
 tab bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ne ghar kii safai karaane ke saath-saath yediurppa kii jarurat ke mutabik ghar ke deshi shauchalay ko badalakar pashchimi style kaa karvaa diya tha
 The family claims that Yeddyurappa had stayed back, but despite repeated assertions, BJP workers did not convert the commode-laden Western-style toilet into a native-style toilet again
 is parivaar ko bijepi kaaryakartaaon ne kuch paise jarur die
 The family had to make the toilet undone Indian style by taking a loan of Rs 12000 at a five percent interest rate
 ghar kii malkin indrani kaa kahana he ki shauchalay ko bhartiya style main badalawaane par 15 hajaar rupee kaa kharch aayaa
 They gave three thousand rupees
 baaki vyay ke liye paanch fisadi byaaj par karj liya
 a loan of 12 thousand rupees is a huge amount for this family
 parivaar kaa guzaara gharelu kaamkaaj or auto rickshaw ke jariye hota he
 Local BJP MP PC Mohan feels that the opposition is unnecessarily blushing this small thing
 unka kahana he ki us parivaar ne khud hi hamen ofer kiya tha
 Congressmen are making it an issue
 agar aisa kuch he to ham dekhenge
 Family photo with Yeddyurappa kept in Indrani's house
 slam main indrani ke ghar ko sabhi jaanate hai kyonki uske ghar main yediurppa ruke the
 But this popularity has to be paid by Indrani with debt

 antni ke is bayaan par karaara prahaar karte hue arun jetali ne kaha, 'yah bayaan pakistan ko hi bachane kaa rasta detaa he
 Pakistan has already claimed that it has nothing to do with terrorist activities taking place in India
 chaahe koi bhi aatanki vaardaat ho, paak kaa ekmaatr jawaab yahi hota he
 Take the Kargil war of 1999
 paak aaj bhi un ghuspaithiyon ko apana nahin maanata
 If Antony also speaks in this language, Pakistan will use it as a thief way
 'arun jetali ne kaha, 'pakistani sarkaar sambandh sudhaarney kii baat karti he
 At the same time, his army is attacking our soldiers
 kya vaaki main pakistani sena apane sarkaar kii baat nahin maanati he yaa phir ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 It is important for us to know this
 pakistan se baatcheet honi chahie
 But it depends on the attitude of the neighboring country
 maujuuda halaat main sarkaar ko munhtod jawaab dene kii jarurat he
 'he said,' Pakistan cannot be given the benefit of doubt
 piem ne kai saal pehle haraare main kaamanwealth meet se lautate hue kaha tha ki pakistan bhi aatankwaad kaa victom he
 In Sharm el-sheikh, we changed our foreign policy
 pakistan ko yah sunishchit karne ko kaha gaya ki unki jameen kaa istemaal bharat main aatank ko badhaava dene ke liye naa kiya jaae
 In this situation, talks between the two countries proceeded
 par sthiti aaj bhi nahin badali he
 Conspiracies are still being hatched against our country on Pakistani soil
 'kya bole sapa saansad ramgopal yadavaraksha mantri kaa bayaan niraashajanak hai
 There are incidents on our border from China and Pakistan
 ye desh ke logon kaa, sena kaa, balon kaa manobal tod rahi hai
 We are not in this position, the leadership is not in a position that we can speak to Pakistan or China government properly
 vipaksh ke netaa ne shuru main hi kaha ki pakistan se baat karenge ye kahkar bachane kaa rasta de diya
 They killed the army men
 aap kah rahe hai ki aatankwaadiyon ne maaraa
 He is also saying the same thing
 aapane apane bayaan se bachane kaa rasta de diya
 We cannot say anything to them

 The PM also told the parliamentary delegation led by Syed Nayyar Hussain Bukhari, Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan, that the close relationship between the parliaments of the two countries is necessary to strengthen bilateral relations
 yahaan pakistan ucchayog ne jari ek bayaan main kaha, ‘vaarta prakriya kii bahaali kaa swaagat karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha ki bharat majboot, sthir or samrudh pakistan dekhnaa chahta he or unhen vahaan loktantr ko falte-phoolate hue dekhakar khushi hoti he
 'bukhari felt that parliamentary diplomacy would be more beneficial in improving relations between the two countries as members of parliament represent the aspirations of the public
 manmohan singh se 45 minute kii bhent ke baad bukhari ne kaha, ‘hamaari mulaakaat bahut acchhee rahi
 We discussed bilateral issues
 yah ek sakaaratmak cheez he ki donon desh baatcheet kar rahe hai taaki sambandhon main sudhaar aae
 Apart from Manmohan Singh, the delegation met Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley and Chairman of Indian Council for Cultural Relations Karn Singh and many other prominent leaders

 ' gujarat board ke guuruuvaar ko 10veen ke nattejey ghoshit ki gaye
 Only 54 percent of the children could pass the exam
 in parinaamon ko 10 saal ke sabase bure nattejey kaha ja rahaa he
 The children said that this year the mathematics paper was very difficult due to which the result of the children was disturbed
 kai bachche parinaam ke vakt rote najar aae
 Last year, the results were close to 64 percent
 har saal 10 lakh se zyada bachche 10veen kii pariksha dete hai, aise main parinaam kam aana matlab lakhon bacchon kaa fail hona
 It is important that before this the results of 12th Science and 12th Commerce have also been very bad
 tippaniyan 12th Science had about 84 percent results, which was 8 percent less than last year and 54 percent results for 12th Commerce, which is said to be the best result of last 20 years
 aise main sawaal ye uthta he ki shiksha ke kshetra main pichde gujarat main kya shiksha kaa str or gir rahaa he? Experts say that this time the difficult paper of mathematics has definitely been the reason for the bad result of 10th class
 lekin itane bure parinaam chintaa kii baat he
 But at the same time, during this time, strict steps were taken to prevent theft, so even fewer children have passed
 to kya pichley saalon main jo achche parinaam rahe wo chori kii vajah se the? iskaa koi jawaab nahin he
 But one thing most experts believe that education is not being given as much attention as is needed in the state
 pichley saal parinaam 64 pratishat ke kareeb aae the
 Every year more than 10 lakh children appear for the 10th exam, in such a case, the result is less, the failure of millions of children
 mahatvapurn he ki isse pehle 12veen science or 12veen commers ke nattejey bhi bahut hi bure rahe hai
 The comments 12veen science ke kareeb 84 pratishat nattejey rahe the jo pichley saal se 8 pratishat kam the or 12veen commers ke 54 fisadi nattejey rahe the jo pichley 20 saal kaa sabase pura parinaam bataaya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that in education sector, is the level of education falling further backward in Gujarat? jaankaar kehete hai ki is baar 10veen ke bure nattejey ke liye zarur hi ganit kaa kathin paper kaaran rahaa he
 But such bad results are a matter of concern
 lekin saath hi ye bhi ki is baar parikshaw ke dauraan chori rokane ke liye kade kadam uthaaye gayi the isaliye bhi kam bachche paas hue hai
 So were the good results in the last years due to theft? There is no answer to this
 lekin ek baat zyaadaatar jaankaar maanate hai ki rajya main shiksha par jitani jarurat he utana dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he

 3
 To get rid of warts, even if there is a wart stain on your skin, the use of banana peel will be beneficial for you

 iske liye kai tarah ke remote sencing upkaran banaae gaye
 Also, for the first time, the need of Deep Space Network (DSN) was felt, because for the first time an Indian mission was going so far in space
 tab bade-bade anti vaala deep spes network banaaya gaya taaki sudur antariksh main sampark sthapit kiya ja sake
 All these took about 5 years to complete
 launch ke liye chunaa gaya sabase bharosemand rocket pieselvi
 Chandrayaan-1 launched from reliable rocket PSLV-C11 The PSLV rocket made 12 successful launches in 15 years before the launch of Chandrayaan-1
 isliye sabase bharosemand rocket ko chunaa gaya
 In mid-2008 PSLV launched 29 satellites simultaneously
 us samay yah bahut badi baat thi
 Therefore, this rocket was chosen
 lekin isamen thodaa badlaav kiya gaya
 So that it can lift the weight of Chandrayaan-1
 is rocket main lambey or bade strap on lagaae gaye
 On 22 October 2008, the Chandrayaan-1 was launched from PSLV-C11 rocket to travel to the moon
 ISRO kaa bada mishanh agle saal antariksh main karegaa aisa prayog jo aaj tak nahin kiyacahandration-1 chand ke chaaron taraf 3400 se zyada chakkar lagaexhandration-1 ne 22 oktober ko launch hone ke baad antariksh main 7 chakkar lagaate hue 8 november ko chand kii pehali kaksha main pahunchaa
 After changing the moon's orbit four times, on November 12, Chandrayaan-1 came closest to the moon
 yani chand kii sataha se 100 kilometre upar
 Where he had to revolve around the moon
 chandrayan-1 ne kareeb 11 maheene kaam kiya
 The power supply to the Chandrayaan-1 was interrupted due to excessive radiation and the computers involved had stopped functioning
 jisaki vajah se iskaa prithvi ke deep spes network se sampark tut gaya tha
 What kind of reward? Before Chandrayaan-2, the government had to work for the salary of ISRO scientists for 2 years
 lekin isane 11 maheene hi kaam kiya
 During this, he made more than 3400 rounds around the moon
 2 july 2016 ko america antariksh agency nasa (NASA) ke ground radar system ne ek baar phir chandrayan-1 ko khoj nikaala
 He was circling around the moon in the same orbit
 kya mila Chandrayaan-1 mishan se desh ko, ISRO ko?chandrayan-1 ne yah bataaya ki chand kii sataha par pani maujuud he
 During the 3400 rounds, Chandrayaan-1 sent about 70 thousand 3D images to Earth
 usne chand ke 70 fisadi hisse kii tasviren prithvi par bheji thim
 It was a record at that time

 Robbery and double murder created a furore in Ghaziabad Tronic City area

 lekin aarope he ki 100 number par phone nahin lag paaya
 Meanwhile, the miscreants continued to orchestrate the house, listening to the noise, when the neighbor Sonu and his brother came to the spot, the miscreants started firing bullets

 Therefore Dharmveer was sleeping outside the house and in the meantime the dacoits attacked

 At the moment it is completely clear that if a 100 number call was made, then it would not have been double murder

 But the question is also why the UP Police, which is constantly facing the encounter, is not able to stop the crimes of crime in the district

 It is likely that according to the wishes of the victim's family, the body will be taken directly to her hometown in Uttar Pradesh where she will be cremated on Sunday morning
 Video :jangal kii jameen par patni kaa resort Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati on Monday dismissed the allegations leveled against her over allegations of disproportionate assets and expenditure incurred by the state exchequer on construction of monuments, parks and statues in the state
 He said that all the allegations being made against him are a conspiracy to weaken the BSP movement by spoiling his image
 basapa sansthaapak kanshiram kii 76veen jayanti par party ke sthapana kii rajat jayanti ke maukey par yahaan yojit ‘rashtriya mahareli’ main lakhanu main yojit party kii raily ko sambodhit karte hue mayawati ne kaha ki agar party desh ke anya rajyon main satta par kabiz hui to vahaan bhi sarkari kharche se dalit mahapurushon ke bhavy smarak banavaane kaa kaam kiya jayega
 Mayawati called all anti-bsp parties, especially Congress, as anti-dalit, and said that the establishment of monuments, parks and statues built in the name of great men associated with the upliftment of Dalit society under the BSP rule was absolutely appropriate
 unhone kaha ki desh or pradesh main aazaadee ke baad se adhikansh samay tak satta main rahi congress party ne yadi dalit samaaj ke mahapurushon ke smarak banawaaye hote to hamen aisa karne kii jarurat nahin padati
 Unaware of all the criticisms, Mayawati said that her government has spent less than one percent of the budget on the memorials of the great men of the Dalit society, but the Congress Party governments have gone to the corners of the country in the name of the great men associated with the Gandhi Nehru family
 i have built memorials at a cost of thousands of crores of rupees and all of that has also been made at government expense
 yah aarope lagaate hue ki basapa raaj main bane smarakon kaa virodh isliye kiya ja rahaa he ki dalit samaaj ke utthan or samtamulak samaaj kii sthapana ke liye sangharsh karne waalo kaa naam mit jaye, mayawati ne kaha ki hamane in mahapurushon ke smarak banavaakar inkaa naam amar kar diya he or aane vaali peediyaan unase prerana legi
 Rejecting criticism from the opposition parties for getting her own idols installed, Mayawati said that her idols are being installed in honor of her wish written in the will of the party's founder Kanshi Ram
 unhone virodhiyon ko nishane par lete hue sawaal kiya ki koi samvidhan visheshgy yah to bataaye ki aakhir kahaan likhaa he ki jinda vyakti kii murti sthapit nahin kii ja sakati
 Referring to Congress National General Secretary Rahul Gandhi, Mayawati said that the Congress party and other parties with uncle and nephews have been exposed to what they are pretending to go to dalits to eat and spend the night
 mayawati ne congress ko dalit virdohi bataate hue kaha ki iskaa taaja pramaan mahilaon ko diye ja rahe 33 pratishat aarakshan main daliton kaa kota nishchit na kiya janaa he
 He said that the party is adamant on demanding reservation quota for Dalits as well as backward classes, minorities and upper castes in 33 percent reservation given to women and in support of this, Baba Saheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar's birthday, April 14 Will be demonstrated at all district headquarters
 mayawati ne apane khilaaf aay se adhik sampatti ke aarope main chal rahi sibiai jaanch ke maamalon kaa ullekh karte hue party samarthakon ko bhramit na hone kii hidaayat di
 He said that party founder Kanshi Ram had long ago expressed the apprehension that as the party grows stronger, efforts will be made to indulge it in lawsuits etc
 and this is happening today
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki aise tamaam mukademon kii prabhavi pairvi ke liye party ke rashtriya mahasachiv satish chandra mishra kii adhyakshata main rashtriya legal cell gathit kiya jaayegaa
 He said that Mishra's main responsibility will be to lead the legal cell, but he will remain connected to the party's publicity and other programs as before
 mukhyamantri mayawati ne apni sarkaar main bhrashtachar ke virodhiyon ke aaropon ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki zyaadaatar samay congress or anya partiyaan satta main raheen or zyaadaatar adhikari purvavarti sarkaron main bhrasht rahe
 He said that it will take a little more time to rectify this situation
 badhati manhagaai ke liye kendra sarkaar kii nitiyon ko jimmedaar tehraate hue mayawati ne kaha ki yadi manhagaai par niyantran nahi kiya jaataa to unki party iske viruddh raashtra vyapee andolan chhedegi
 Mayawati referred to the struggles of its founder Kanshi Ram from Bamsef and BS4 till the founding of BSP in 1984
 ambedkar ke nidhan ke baad jis tareeke se unki republican party aaf india (arpiai) ke netaaon ko daraa dhamkaakar yaa lobh laalach dekar apni party main shaamil karke arpiai ko khatm kar diya, usee tarah samay samay par basapa ke logon ko todakar ise bhi khatm karne kii koshish kii gayi
 He said that Kanshi Ram has created such a strong support base that some leaders went, but the workers remained firmly with the party
 basapa supremeo ne desh bhar se jute kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki aaj desh ke sabase bade rajya main chauthi baar or sattarudh hui basapa 25 varsh ke bheetar hi desh kii saat rashtriya partiyon main shaamil he or loksabhaa ke donon sadanon ke saath anek rajyon kii vidhaan sabhaaon main iskaa pratinidhitiv he
 Mayawati reached the slogan of Bahujan with Sarvajan by making the voters of Dalit society a pivot and said that although her party has adopted the slogan of Sarvajan Hitayya Sarvajan Sukhaya, but 'my top priority will always be Dalit society, which has every opportunity But supported me
 mujhe is par naaj he or jab tak meri saans rahegi main dalit samaaj kaa sir jhukne nahi duungi
 On this occasion, Mayawati also released a book written in Hindi and English based on the life struggle of party founder Kanshi Ram and a CD of an hour-long film
 ullekhneey he ki basapa kii ‘rashtriya mahareli’ ke liye rajdhani lakhanu ko nile rango ke jhande bannron se rang diya gaya tha or jagah jagah par mayawati, kanshiram or da
 Large cutouts were installed for the great men associated with the upliftment of Dalit society including Bhimrao Ambedkar
 jab mayawati raily ko sambodhit karne ke liye helicopter se ramabai ambedkar maidan pahunchi to unke samarthakon ne joardaar naare lagaakar or nile gubaare hawa main udaakar unka swaagat kiya

 - input bhashaa se Just as South Africa has proved to be chokers in ICC tournaments, Royal Challengers Bangalore are in the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 aaarasibi kii team shuruyaat se hi ipel kii sabase majboot tiimon main se ek rahi he
 Since the first edition, this team has played more than one star
 lekin maje kii baat yah he ki unka pradarshan us tarah kaa nahin rahaa jisaki ummid sabko thi
 Let's take a look at the journey of Bangalore so far in the IPL
 2008 main bangaleru ne khadi kii test team, rahi 7wein number par
 
 royal chalangers bangaleru ipel ke pehle sanskaran main rahul dravid kii captaini main maidan main utari
 Legendary players such as Jack Kallis, Mark Boucher, Dale Steyn, misbah-ul-haq, Ross Taylor, Cameron White, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan became part of the Bangalore team
 lekin super star khilaadiyon saji yah team apane 14 main se maatr 4 match hi jeet saki
 In fact, according to T20 cricket this team did not prove to be suitable at all, and finished 7th
 2009 main kismat badali, lekin final main haare
 
 royal chalangers bangaleru ne 2008 kii team main badlaav karte hue 2009 main robin uthppa, rilof vendor marv, jesi rider or kevin petersan ko team shaamil kiya
 Kevin Pietersen was given command of the team for the opening matches, but Pietersen had to return midway due to the series against the West Indies
 iske baad team kii kaman anil kumble ko di gai
 In 2009, the IPL was shifted to South Africa due to Lok Sabha elections and security reasons
 jagah main parivartan bangaleru ke kismat main bhi badlaav lekar aayaa or unhone final main jagah banaai
 But in the final, they lost to Deccan Chargers, and the trophy dream remained unfulfilled
 2010 main semifinal main aakar chuke
 
 2010 main royal chalangers bangaleru kii kaman ek baar phir anil kumble ko di gai
 Almost all the 2009 veterans were present in this 2010 team
 lekin T20 kii maang ko dekhte hue england ke oin morgan or dakshin africa ke dillan du pres ko dal main shaamil kiya gaya
 Bangalore won 7 of their 14 matches and advanced to the semi-finals
 lekin bade maukon par aakar chukne kaa silsilaa 2010 main bhi jari rahaa, or aaarasibi semifinal main mumbai ke haathon 35 ran se harkar khitaab kii daud se baahar ho gai
 Finals reached the finals in 2011, but again became a choker
 
 Making extensive changes in 2011, Royal Challengers Bangalore included Chris Gayle, Tillakaratne Dilshan, AB de Villiers, Dirk Naines and Daniel Vettori
 vittori ko team kii kaman saunpi gai
 The team's performance was excellent throughout the season
 lekin final main aakar ek baar phir aaarasibi ne aatmasamarpan kar diya
 In the finals, he was pitted against MS Dhoni's team Chennai Super Kings
 chennai ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 205 ran thonk daale
 In response to this, the Bangalore team rolled to just 147 runs
 2012, 2013 or 2014 main play of main bhi nahin pahunch sake
 
 2011 main final main haarane ke baad 2012, 2013 or 2014 main bangaleru kii team play of main bhi jagah nahin bana pai he
 It is not that the team was weak
 gail, divilliars, viraat kohli, muralidharan or yuvaraj jaise diggaj team kaa hissaa the
 But the process of missing out on big occasions did not stop
 2015 main kya khatm hoga khitaab kaa intjaar?2015 main ek baar phir royal chalangers bangaleru viraat kohli kii captaini main maidan par utar rahi he
 This time, many foreign giants have been included to remove the pressure on Gayle and de Villiers, but also strengthen the pool of domestic players
 adam milane, riley ruso, shaun abot, darren saimi or david vis jaise khilaadi is baar team kii sambhaavnaaon ko badhayenge
 Among the domestic players, players like s Badrinath, Dinesh Karthik, Iqbal Abdullah and Mandeep Singh will open the options for the team
 haalanki ghayal mishael stark or adam milne kii gaiyr maujuudagi se aaarasibi kii gendbaaji kamjor hui he
 But the only question is, will the wait for the title end this time? The team is as follows: foreign players - AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle, Darren Sammy, Mitchell Starc, Nick Medinson, Riley Russo, Shawn Abbott, Adam Milne and David Weiss
 gharelu khilaadi-viraat kohli (captain), dinesh karthik, es badrinaath, mandeep singh, varun aaron, yujavendra chahal, vijay jol, yogesh takaavle, abu nechim ahamed, herschel patel, ashok dinda, sandip variyar, manvinder bisla, ikbaal abdulla, jalaj saxena, sarfaraj khan or shishir bavane

 jabaki narayan ke cese kii jaanch surat main hi hogi
 In fact, two Surat-based sisters have accused Asaram and his son of sexual exploitation
 badi bahan ne asaram par ahmedabad ke ashram main yon shoshan kaa aarope lagaaya he, jabaki choti bahan ne surat ke ashram main narayan sai par aise hi aarope lagaae hai

 Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' states that the idea of former Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was - not war, but should be Buddha 'and PM Modi has got the idea
 china daure par saamana main likhaa gaya he ki piem modi ne vahanatankwaad or seemaa ulanghanpar koi baat nahin kii he
 It is also written that China is supporting Pakistan's terrorism, but PM Modi did not say a word during the discussion with Chinese President Xi Jinping
 saamana main ye bhi likhaa gaya he ki piem modi ko china kii seemaa par shanti chahie
 Linking PM Modi's policy to the election, it was written, 'once the election is over, then the policy of PM Modi who sees it is visible
 'nehru ko mahangi padi thi dostisamna main piem modi ko jawahar laal nehru or china kii dosti se jodakar dekha gaya
 It is written that friendship with China cost dear to Pandit Nehru

 Today our message to the # BJP is simple: # Hug, don't hate
 
 # hugdaya post shared by Congress (@incindia) on Feb 12, 2019 at 4:49 am PST Rahul Gandhi, who is always targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, often says that he does not hate the Prime Minister
 kuch saptaah pehle rahul gandhi ne bhubaneshwar main ne kaha tha, 'vah (piem modi) mujhase asahmat honge, main unase asahmat hum or main unase ladaai laduunga lekin main unase nafrat nahin karata

 On Tuesday, quoting a new media report surfaced in the Rafale case, Rahul Gandhi accused PM Modi of acting like a 'middleman' of industrialist Anil Ambani and violating government secrecy laws, claiming that the Prime Minister did what That is 'treason'
 gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki rashtriya suraksha se samjhauta karne ke liye modi par aapraadhik karrwai shuru honi chahie
 He also questioned that before the Prime Minister's visit to France, how did Ambani know that the deal was going to happen and he would get the contract? However, the BJP has dismissed the allegation, saying that the Airbus executive sent an email referring to a helicopter deal and not Rafael
 reliance dephence ne bhi ek bayaan jari kar gandhi ke is aarope kaa khandan karte hue kaha ki email main ullekith "prastaavit emoyu" kaa zikr airbas helicopter ke saath uske sahyog ko lekar kiya gaya he
 The Congress president has spoken a fresh attack on the Prime Minister after a report in the English newspaper Indian Express said that in the fourth week of March 2015, businessman Anil Ambani visited the Paris-based office of the then French defense minister jean-yves Le Drian

 jaswant singh ke badale jis ummidavaar ke bharose bijepi barmer fatah kii soch rahi he usee karnal sonaaram ko chunaav main jeet ke liye doda-post yani opium par shraddha he
 At a party meeting, Sonaram demanded an opium from Vasundhara Raje at a gathering of activists who were working to create an election strategy
 pashchim rajasthan main opium pilaakar vot maangane kaa maamla aam he
 Perhaps this was the reason that Vasundhara neither rebuked nor gave any warning on Sonaram's demand
 yani opium kii maang kaa samarthan kiya vasundhara raaje ne bhi
 However, during the reign of Vasundhara Raje 10 years ago, when Jaswant Singh had set up a rayan or opium panchayat at his house, CM Sahiba filed a case in the Narcotics Department
 darasal pashchimi rajasthan main riyaan yani opium panchayatein tay karti hai ki vot kisko dalegaa
 When the elders of the society sit together to decide the votes, then poppy is dissolved and when once the opium has been drunk on behalf of a party, then the same has to be voted
 riyaan main shaamil har shaks us opium kaa ghunt peetaa he
 Riyana runs from village to village in Chanav
 jise opium panchayat bhi kehete hai
 Citing this custom, the Barmer candidate of BJP demanded doda-posta, on which the applause also rang
 congress chhod bijepi main shaamil hue sonaaram kii is karatuut kii aad main congress sonaaram ke khilaaf karrwai ke mood main he
 Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma says that the party will complain about this
 unhone kaha, 'ye behad nindaneey he ki vasundhara kii maujuudagi main ummidwar nashe kii maang kar rahe hai or badhaava de rahe hai, ye bijepi ke dohare charitra ko darshata he'

 co / 2 am3woii3z — The White House (@whitehouse) January 11, 2017 swat ghati main taliban ne mahilaon kaa jeena haraam kar diya he
 First girls stopped going to school
 phir mahilaon ke ghar se nikalne par pabandi laga di or ab usne farmaan jari kar kaha he ki mahilaayein apana pahchaan patr nahin bana saktin
 Because in the eyes of the Taliban it is against Islam
 swat ghati main yah farmaan jari kiya he taharike-e-taliban ke commander omar farukh ne
 In Swat Valley, government employees have been ordered not to issue an I-card to women
 taliban ne dhamkee di he ki agar koi sarkari mulajim uske farmaan kii andekhi karegaa to use maut ke ghat utaar diya jayega
 The Taliban do not like the freedom of women
 taliban ko mahilaon kaa baahar ghoomana pasand nahin
 The Taliban do not like girls going to school and now they have said that they do not like to give the I-card to the women because the I-card bears the picture of women, which is against Islam
 swat ghati main mahilaon ko pahchaan patr baantne kaa kaam paak ke neshnal databes registration othirti ne shuru kiya tha lekin ab taliban ke farmaan aane ke baad use ye kaam band karnaa hoga
 Not only does the Taliban rule the Swat Valley, but they also have their own separate laws that they enact themselves
 swat main aaj mahilaon ke saath jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he wo afghanistan kii yaad dilaataa he kyonki taliban ne vahaan bhi mahilaon kii jindagi isi tarah haraam kar di thi
 Imran Khan, who is associated with social concerns like his maternal uncle, had filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) a year and a half ago on which the court order has come
 bombai hai court ne is piiel kii sunwaayee karte hue rajya sarkaar ko yah nirdesh diya he ki vah imran khan kii is yachika kaa jawaab de
 Imran is very happy with the progress in this matter
 ve puri ladaai ladane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Significantly, the Maharashtra government had increased the age of drinking alcohol from 21 years to 25 years, then Imran had raised his voice against this
 unka maananaa he ki 21 saal kaa yuva apana sahi or galat samajhataa he or usase yah aazaadee honi chahie ki vah sahi-galat main chayan kar sake
 Imran filed a PIL against it in September 2011
 imran kehete aae hai ki ve sharaab pine kii vakaalat nahin kar rahe hai
 Even Imran himself does not drink alcohol and also advises everyone not to drink
 unka tark he ki agar is desh main shaadi karne kii umr 21 saal or vot dene kii umr 18 saal he jo donon hi bahut jimmedaari vaala kaam he to drink karne kii umr 25 saal kyon? In Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh, Congress workers clashed in front of Onkar Singh Markam, Minister in-charge of the district

 There was an uproar in front of the minister in charge about this
 iske baad markaam colectrate main fasal rin maafee yojana kii pragati or vibhageeya kaam kii samiksha baithak lene lage
 But due to the power gained after 15 years, the Congress workers may have forgotten that this meeting was for government officials and local Congress leaders stayed with the minister even in the government meeting

 Expressing concern over the 'poor quality' of teachers, Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal said on Tuesday that teachers need to be given good salaries to ensure quality education
 shikshak samudaay ne sibbal ke is bayaan kaa swaagat kiya he
 In a conference, Sibal said that unless the teachers get proper benefits, good talent will not be attracted towards this field
 unhone kaha, "shikshakon ke vetan main samanta nahin he
 They do not get any medical benefits, housing allowance or other facilities and pension
 " unke anusaar, "abhibhavak bhi apane bacchon ko aisi naukari ke liye protsaahit karte hai, jisase unhen adhik paise mili
 We cannot do anything unless we believe that creating human capital by educating children is of paramount importance
 " This statement of Sibal has been welcomed by the teachers
 dilli ke tagore international skool kii pradhanacharya madhulika sen ne kaha, "main kendriya mantri se puri tarah sahamat hum
 Teachers get low salaries, so they have to look for other options
 " However, Jyoti Bose, Principal of Springdale Public School, said that the salary of teachers has increased but it is the temper of the corporate world that takes talent away from us
 tippaniyan Nirmal Sonkar, who has been serving in a government school for the past 20 years, said that the Union Minister should insist on increasing the number of teachers
 sibbal ne yah bhi kaha ki ek aisi vyastha banane kii jarurat he, jisase shikshakon ko apane kshetra ke bare main jaankaree adhyatan karne main madad mil sake
 He said that the National Mission is being launched in the 12th Five Year Plan to train teachers, which aims to improve the quality of teachers
 ek sammelan main sibbal ne kaha ki jabatak shikshakon ko uchit laabh nahin milegaa, tabatak acchhee pratibhaaen is kshetra kii ore aakarshith nahin hongi
 He said, "there is no equality in salaries of teachers
 unhen koi chikitsa laabh, awaas bhatta yaa anya suvidhaayen va pension nahin miltaa he
 "according to him," parents also encourage their children to work in a job that earns them more money
 jabatak ham yah na maan len ki bacchon ko shikshit kar maanviya puunji nirmaan karnaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn he, ham kuch nahin kar sakate
 " sibbal ke is bayaan kaa shikshakon ne swaagat kiya he
 Madhulika Sen, Principal of Tagore International School in Delhi said, “I completely agree with the Union Minister
 shikshakon ko kam vetan miltaa he, isliye unhen anya vikalpon kii talash kerani padati he
 " springdel public skool ke pradhanacharya jyoti bose ne haalanki, kaha ki shikshakon kaa vetan badha he lekin yah korporate duniya kaa tadak-bhadak he jo pratibha ko hamase dur le jaataa he
 The comments sarkaar ke ek skool main pichley 20 varsh se seva kar rahe nirmal sonkar ne kaha ki kendriya mantri ko shikshakon kii sankhya badhaane par jor dena chahie
 Sibal also said that there is a need to create an arrangement that can help teachers update information about their field
 unhone kaha ki shikshakon ko prashikshit karne ke liye 12veen panchavarshiya yojana main rashtriya mishan shuru kiya ja rahaa he, jiskaa uddeshy shikshakon kii gunvattta main sudhaar karnaa he

 bhaajapa kii yojana kaa sanket dete hue party adhyaksh amit shah ne 4 may ko aagaamee vidhansabha chunaavon ko kisaanon kaa pratinidhitiv karne waalon banaam korporate gharaanon or maharaajaaon kaa pratinidhitiv karne waalon ke bich kii ladaai qaraar diya
 Clearly, this was aimed at Kamal Nath, the new state president of the Congress and Jyotiraditya Scindia, the newly appointed in-charge of the election campaign committee
 bhopalmein shah ke do ghante ke daure ne halchal paidaa kar di, kyonki unhone karnataka main chunaav prachaar kii vyastata se samay nikaal kar pradesh bhaajapa kaaryakarini kii 'vistaarit' baithak ko sambodhit karne ke liye pradesh kaa daura kiya tha
 Block level workers of the state were also included in this meeting
 isse ek din pehle mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne anand vibhaag ke ek kaarykram main yah sanket dekar rahasy paidaa kar diya tha ki ve shaayad ab maidan se hatane ke liye taiyaar hai
 But later it was learned that Shah had come there only to show support for the new party president of the state, Rakesh Singh
 bhaajapa adhyaksh vahaan chunavi ranneeti taiyaar karne bhi gaye the, kyonki rahul gandhi ne anpekshit rup se kamalnath ko congress kaa pradesh adhyaksh niyukt kar diya tha
 Earlier, considering the election as a contest between Chauhan and Scindia, BJP was going to campaign to make the issue of 'kisan Putra vs Maharaja'
 lekin kamalnath ko adhyaksh banaae jane ke baad shah ne badi chaturaai se congress par hamalaa karte hue aarope lagaaya ki vah korporate ke hiton ke liye kaam karnaa chaahati he
 Responding to this, Kamal Nath questioned the bjp's claims of being farmers friendly
 unhone kaha, ''rajya main kisaan badi sankhya main aatmahatya kar chuke hai
 
 
 And when they protest they are shot by the police
 ''shah kaaryakarta-kendrit abhiyaan taiyaar karne par dhyaan de rahe hai, taaki satta virdohi hawa ko kam kiya ja sake
 Emphasizing the workers to publicize the works of the Chief Minister and the Prime Minister, he said, "the election will be won on the basis of the work of the party organization
" ''karnataka main anischitata ke vipareet shah madhya pradesh main zyada aashwast hai, jahaan unke mutabik, kaaryakartaaon ko keval jeet ke antar ko badhaane ke liye kaam karnaa hoga
 There is no doubt about the organizational strength of the party having 65 lakh active members (according to the party) in the state
 isse muqabla karne ke liye congress ko kadaa muqabla karnaa hoga
 The BJP wants the election battle to be transformed into the battle of Kisan Putra vs Maharaja

 ) pulavama hamale par jis tarah se vipaksh sarkaar se sawaal puch rahaa he usapar kendriya grahamantri rajnath singh ne aapatti jataai he
 Rajnath said that through the opponents, accusations are being made against the government
 pakistan main hamaari sena ne jaakar hamalaa kiye kya itnaa hi kaaphi nahin he
 He said in very strong words that those who are repeatedly questioning the air strike, i want to ask them, after dropping the bomb, our army would go there and count
 jo sawaal kar rahe hai wo bataaen ki aakhirkaar paak kyon pareshaan hua
 We entered Pakistan and took revenge and no weak country could do it
 pulavama kaa hamalaa ye bataata he ki bharat kamazor nahin taaqatvar desh he
 Under Modi's leadership, India rose from 9th to 6th among the top 10 countries in the world
 or desh 2030 main duniya ke top 3 main aa jayega
 Just yesterday, Digvijay Singh used the word accident for an attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama in one of his tweets
 jiske baad unki puure desh main kirakiri ho gai
 But Digvijay is not the only one to call the Pulwama attack an accident, but BJP leader and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has also described the Pulwama attack as an accident
 soshal media par keshav prasad maury kaa ek video khud digvijay singh ne ritvit kiya he
 In which Maurya is describing the terror attack as a major accident with the soldiers
 video dekhakar samajha ja saktaa he ki jab patrakaron ne pulavama aatanki hamale main suraksha kii chook se judaa koi sawaal poocha to jawaab dete hue maury ne kaha ki chook jaise shabd kaa prayog haryana kii dharti ke patrakaron ko nahin karnaa chahie
 i think the Prime Minister has put his message in front of the country regarding the accident that happened with CRPF personnel
 uttarapradesh ke upmukhyamantri keshav prasad maury ne pulavama hamale ko badi 'durghatana' bataaya
 So will Maurya also be called a traitor? The media created a ruckus on the statement of Digvijay Singh ji, the same ruckus will now arise or will enter the bill

 The Prime Minister has already told when and how the army needs to take action and there is no need to speak more than this
 saath hi unhone pradhanmantri ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki jo aag deshavaasiyon ke dil main vahiin pradhanmantri ke dil main bhi he
 a BJP banner is written behind the video of Keshav Prasad, with the date of February 21 written on it
 unke bayaan se saaf he ki yah video 26 farvari ko hui air strike se pehle kaa he
 Congress leader Digvijay Singh retweeted the video in which it is written that now Keshav Prasad Maurya will also be called a traitor
 video digvijay singh ke bayaan se pehle kaa he
 This is also seen from what is said in it
 videshi media kii kuch reports main bataaya gaya ki is strike main pakistan main kisi prakaar kaa koi nuksaan nahin hua he
 At the same time, it is being claimed that terrorists have piled into it
 bhaajapa ke sahyogi dal shivasena ne bhi mangalvaar ko kaha tha ki air strike main maare gaye aatankiyon kii jaankaree ke bare main desh ke har naagarik ko haq he
 At the same time, Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu taunted and asked whether the terrorists had gone there to kill or to uproot the trees
 iske liye unhone ek media report kaa hawala diya tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki is air strike main keval ek ped ko nuksaan pahunchaa hai or koi aatanki nahin maaraa gaya
 On this basis, the opposition is now trying to surround the government
 or lagaataar ye sawaal uthaa rahe ki air strike main kul kitne aatanki maare gaye
 He told that Jitendra is having a ground dispute with some people from the village itself
 ashanka jataai ja rahi he ki isi maamle main dehshat paidaa karne yaa kisi badi ghatana ko anjaam dene ke liye ye log yahaan bulaae gaye the

 bijepi ne kaha ki rahul apni is yojana kii shuruyaat empi, rajasthan or chhattisgarh se karen
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said, 'even when we were in opposition, we used to talk about waiving farmers' loans and asked the government, then the government used to say we do not have money, we cannot do this work
 ' unhone kaha, 'hindustan ke chaukeedaar ke paas chhattisgarh ke kisaanon ke liye 6000 karod rupee nahin he, lekin anil ambani ke liye 30,000 karod rupee he
 Mehul Choksi can run away with money, but the central government does not have access to the farmers
 'rahul gandhi ne kaha, 'kya kaaran he ki kisaan apana paisa beemaa company ko detaa he or ola padane par use uskaa paisa nahin miltaa
 The entire benefit goes to Anil Ambani's company
 jaise congress party ne manaregaa main 100 din kaa rojgaar guarantee karke diya, soochna ke adhikaar main guarantee se beuroperesi ke daravaaje khole, bhojan kaa adhikaar guarantee karke diya; vaise hi nunatam aamadani kii guarantee hogi

 For the past few days, news of Swami becoming a VC has been prevalent on social media
 ministry kaa maananaa he ki is mudde par swami ke twit ne afvaahon ko hawa di thi
 Swamy had said in his tweet that before accepting the post of JNUK VC, he has put certain conditions before the ministry
 pts are overwhelmingly against my accepting JNU VC post
 No question of my considering unless allowed to rusticate anti- national students— Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) September 24, 2015 The ministry is not thinking of giving the post of VC to Swamy
 iske peeche do mahatvapurn kaaran hai
 The first reason is that he is over 75 years of age
 jabaki central uniwarsity ke visi kii ritairement kii umr hi 70 saal hoti he
 And the second reason is that the search-cum-selection committee for VC selection in JNU has not been formed
 jeenyu ne kamity ke liye do naam bheje hai, jinhen ab tak uniwarsity ke visitor (raashtrapati) ne final nahin kiya he
 These are Subramanian Swamy's tweet JNU VC episode demonstrates that the Left wing lunatic fringe feels marooned in the Hindutva educated youth ocean
 Even migration no option!— Subramanian Swamy (@swamy39)september 24, 2015vahiin, swami ke twit ke samarthan or virodh main soshal media par bahes tej he
 Swamy had tweeted that if i am given the right to expel anti-national students from the university then it is a different matter
 i think JNU needs an Anti Narcotics Bureau campus branch office to raid dorms and arrest Naxals, jehadis and Elis
 BSF camp also— Subramanian Swamy (@ Swamy39) September 24, 2015 In another tweet, he wrote that JNU should have a BSF and Anti Narcotics Bureau camp so that they can raid and arrest Naxalites and jihadists

 Mayawati also made it clear at the time of Dhananjay Singh's arrest that she would take a decision only after seeing the court's decision
 duusari ore, dhananjay ko ab tak na to jamaanat mili or na hi isaki koi surat najar aa rahi he
 This had a direct impact on the election preparations in the region

 desh kii 4 loksabhaa siton or 10 vidhansabha siton par hue upachunaav ke nattejey guuruuvaar ko aae
 The by-election between the NDA and the Grand Alliance in 14 seats had a scorecard of 3-11
 2019 ke aam chunaavon kii ore bad rahe raajnneetik dalon ke liye ye nattejey kaaphi doorgaami asar daalane vaale hai
 Read, 10 big messages of these results: 1
 jahaan bijepi ke liye upachunaav ke nattejey bada jhatka maane ja rahe hai vahiin vipakshi mahagathbandhan ke prayog kii safalataa kii kahani bhi bayaan karne vaale rahe
 Especially the sp-bsp's bold political decision in UP made it clear that the 2019 battle for bjp's Chanakya Amit Shah will not be as easy as 2014 in UP
 2
 The victory should be credited to SP President Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati
 jinhone apni sajhi ranneeti se pehle gorakhpur-phulpur or ab kairana-nurpur main bijepi ko maat dekar tamaam dalon ko modi magic ko maat dene kaa achook formula de diya
 3
 ab modi magic kii kaat vipakshi dalon ke paas he or wo he mahagathbandhan kaa formula
 Which was earlier successful in Bihar and is now succeeding in every by-election in UP
 ye bhi padhein
 
 4 loksabhaa, 10 vidhansabha siton ke upachunaavon kaa FINAL RESULT4
 Mamta Banerjee's one-to-one formula is Brahmastra for the opposition
 yani agar bijepi ke siyaasi samikarnon ko maat dena he to chote-bade sabhi dalon ko saath aana padegaa
 There should not be a significant hindrance in this
 jahaan jo jeet saktaa he use jeetne kaa mauka or samarthan dena hi hoga
 For example, in gorakhpur-phulpur, the BSP gave the SP a chance
 kairana main areldi ko or nurpur main sapa ko sabhi vipakshi dalon ne samarthan kiya or 100 fisadi jeet mumkin ho pai
 5
 ye bhi ki bijepi ke liye chunavi ladaai ab 2014 jaisi aasaan nahin he
 The BJP government at the Center has completed 4 years and now the BJP will have to face anti-incumbency on all issues including employment-farmers issues
 ab sirf brands modi jeet dilaane ke liye kaaphi nahin he
 6
 centre kii modi sarkaar ko janata ke bich asar dikhaane vaale thos kadam uthaane honge
 Farmers, youth employment issues, failure to curb the economic mess, etc
 are all such issues which are giving the Opposition a chance to surround the government
 iske alaava ram mandir jaise bijepi ke kor muddon par bhi koi thos pahal nahin hona bijepi ke liye mushkil badha rahi he
 7
 sirf centre kii modi sarkaar hi nahin balki bijepi kii rajya sarkaron ko bhi pradarshan karke dikhaanaa hoga
 At present, there are governments of BJP and allies in more than 20 states of the country
 aane vaale vakt main rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh jaise ahm rajyon main chunaav hone hai
 Whereas the largest state of the country, UP, where BJP came out with a strong majority, has lost in consecutive by-elections
 party ko sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii jamini hakeekat par gambhirtha se gaur karnaa hoga
 8
 mahangaai kaa mudda bijepi ke liye bada sirdard banataa ja rahaa he
 JDU itself, bjp's ally, questioned the petrol and diesel prices and blamed it for the electoral defeat
 9
 However, amid rising challenges in states like up-bihar, there are also some good signs for the BJP
 jaise pashchim bengal main bijepi kii lagaataar paith badhati ja rahi he
 a win in a northeastern state like Tripura has increased prospects for the party in new areas
 tamilnadu or andhra pradesh, odisha jaise rajyon main bijepi sakriy hui he or use iskaa phayda mil saktaa he
 10
 bijepi ke liye sahyogi dalon ko saath lekar chalanaa bhi 2019 main badi chunauti hogi
 In JDU, Shiv Sena, UP, OP Rajbhar's party is dissatisfied, TDP has severed ties with NDA
 assam main assam gan parishad virodh main khadi hoti dikh rahi he
 On the other hand, the number of parties is continuously increasing in the camp of Congress and Grand Alliance
 ye sabhi ghatnakram 2019 ke chunaavon ko rochak banaaenge
