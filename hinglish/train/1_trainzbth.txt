 nitish kumaar ne shanivaar ko dilli main pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat kii
 After which the discussion once again got heated in the political corridors about whether Nitish would break the alliance with RJD and again form an alliance with BJP? This question became even more important because the day before Nitish Kumar had abstained from a meeting on the presidential election called by Congress President Sonia Gandhi and the candidate of the opposition parties
 isi bich bijepi kii ore senithish kumarako ek ofer aayaa ki vah lalu prasad kaa saath chhod dobaaraa bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kar len
 Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Dr CP Thakur, while interacting with Aaj Tak, said that Nitish had been an old friend of BJP
 2013 main kisi vajah se unhone bhaajapa ke saath gathbandhan tod liya tha lekin ab unhen waapas bijepi ke saath gathbandhan kar lenaa chahie
 Thakur said that BJP also wants Nitish Kumar to join NDA back

 But for the past few months, Nitish Kumar has on several occasions made him realize that his attitude towards the BJP has softened and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not a gold-bearer

 Prime Minister Modi's support for surgical strikes and demonetisation was backed by Nitish Kumar when his partner in the Grand Alliance government, Supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, strongly criticized Prime Minister Modi

 It is learned that Chhota Rajan lived in Harare, Zimbabwe from 2003 to 2004, after which he made Australia his destination

 america aane vaale dinon main afghanistan main kam se kam 1000 or sainik bhejne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 The reason for this important decision of the Trump administration is the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi
 america raksha mantralay ke varisht adhikari ne bataaya he ki raashtrapati trump bhartiya piem narendra modi ke tarif bhare shabdon ke baad aisa kar rahe hai
 Modi said in a meeting with Trump last year that no country has contributed so much to any country without any benefit as the US has done in Afghanistan
 america akhbaar washington post kii report ke mutabik america raksha adhikariyon ne bataaya he ki trump bhartiya piem or unke bolne ke andaaj se kaaphi prabhavit hai
 Even when Trump was referring to Modi's statement, his tone and style was similar to that of the Indian Prime Minister
 iske baad hi trump ne afghanistan main zyada sainikon ko bhejne or vahaan nivesh karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The United States believes that with its help, Afghanistan will occupy 80 percent of the country in the coming two years with the help of its army and police
 iske baad afghanistan main maujuud america sainikon kii sankhya 15 hajaar ke kareeb ho jaaegi
 However, Defense Minister Jim Mattis is yet to sign the proposal
 in sainikon ko afghanistani suraksha balon kii madad ke liye bheja ja rahaa he taaki vah taliban se loha lene main afgani suraksha balon kii madad kar saken
 The Obama administration decided in 2015 to end the ongoing US war in Afghanistan
 trump ne satta sanbhaalane ke baad beete saal agast main kaha tha ki america kii salaahkaar timen afghanistan main jaaengi
 Since Trump came to power, the number of American troops in Afghanistan has increased from 8,500 to 14,000
 yahi nahin, unhone america yudhak vimaanon ke opareshnon par lagi roak ko bhi dhilaa karne kaa kaam kiya, jisase beete maheenon main taliban ke thikaanon par america hawaii hamale bhi dekhe gaye hai
 Even before this, Trump was seen mimicking the way Indians speak English
 trump ne april 2016 main apane chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan bhartiya kol centre karmchaariyon ke angreji bolne ke lahaze kii bhi nakal kii thi
 Trump has copied not only the Indian accent, but also the Spanish accent in October 2017
 apni in harkaton kii vajah se america raashtrapati trump soshal media par aksar aalochana kaa shikaar bhi hote rahe hai, haalanki unhen isse fark nahin padataa he
 French director Polanski is once again in the news
 vajah unki koi film nahin, un par chal rahaa dushkarm kaa maamla he
 On hearing of this case in Los Angeles recently, the court has refused to dismiss it
 yah maamla 1970 se chal rahaa he
 Interestingly, the petition to end the case was also given by the victim
 peedita ne adaalat se darkhwaast kii thi ki is maamle ko 40 saal biit chuke hai, isliye dayaa ke taur par ise band kar dena chahie
 But the court says that this request should not be accepted only because it will be in the interest of the victim
 saal 1977 main polanski jab 43 saal ke the, tab yah maamla saamne aada tha
 It is said that Polanski had a coercive relationship with the 13-year-old victim at that time
 is maamle main unhen giraftaar bhi kiya gaya, lekin jamaanat milane ke baad valmericachhodakar faraar ho gaye the
 This is not the only case involving Polanski
 saal 2010 main abhinetri sharlot louis ne bhi aisa hi ek khulaasa kiya tha
 She said that in 1982, when she was 16 years old, Polanski forced her to do the same
 haalanki in maamalon se itar dekhen, to polanski kii pehali hifiture length filmanif in water ko best fahrren language film category main auskar ke liye namakint kiya gaya tha
 Even then, he has been nominated for five Oscars
 unhen khaastaur par riplshan, rosemerij baby, oliver twist, da ghost riter jaisi filmon ke liye janaa jaataa he

 Ganguly wrote in his column in the Sydney Morning Herald, "it must have been a nightmare for Duncan Fletcher
" australia main pichley 12 main se 11 maichon main unhen paraajay jhelni padi he
 There will be a lot of pressure on him and his credibility as a coach is also at stake
 ’unhone kaha, ‘england ke khilaadiyon main bataur coach unki kaaphi izzat he or vah kaamyaab bhi rahe hai lekin philhal vah khud hairaan honge ki sab kuch vipareet kyo ho rahaa he

" ’ Amid the atmosphere of the Lok Sabha elections in 2015, the dispute arising out of the police firing on unarmed people in Bargadi in the year 2015 is not taking its name in Punjab
 is bich bargaadi golicond kii jaanch kar rahi esaiti pramukh aiji kunwar vijay pratap kaa tabadalaa rukwane ke liye kai dal aaj chunaav ayog ke paas pahunch gaye
 On the other hand, the Insaf Morcha is organizing a fury march on Wednesday again about the firing
 is rosh march ne akali dal kii mushkilen badha di he kyonki chunaavon ke mausam main is rosh ke chalate use raajnneetik nuksaan ho saktaa he
 The political loss is because the Akali Dal does politics of religion and this firing happened during the tenure of his government when unarmed protesters were demonstrating peacefully about the absurdity of religious texts
 tabadalaa rukvane kii koshingkali dal ko is pradarshan ke peeche naa keval congress balki aam aadmi party or punjab ekta party najar aa rahi he
 Senior Akali Dal leader Dr Daljit Singh Cheema has said that the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Punjab Ekta Party reached the Election Commission today to stop the transfer of SIT chief IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap, who is investigating the Burgundy shootout, which became clear
 It is said that these three parties shared a conspiracy to politicize the unfortunate incidents of police firing in Bahibal Kalan and Kotkapura
 doctor dalajit singh cheema ne kaha ki congress party dobaaraa jhooth bol rahi he ki police golibari maamle kii jaanch ko roak diya gaya he jabaki sachai yah he ki esaiti team ke sirf ek sadsy kunwar vijay pratap kaa sirf isiilie tabadalaa kiya gaya he, kyonki unhone is mudde par ek raajnneetik intervyuu dekar aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kiya tha
 He said that the implementation of the code of conduct has not stopped the investigation work
 haalanki insaaf morcha ke pradarshan ko lekar congress or duusari partiyaan chuppi saadhe hui hai, lekin is pradarshan se congress ko uskaa raajnneetik phayda jarur milegaa
 The case of the extortion of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015 in the village Burj Jawahar Singh Wala in Bargadi in Faridkot, Bahibal Kalan and Kotkapur Goliyand cases, led to widespread anger among Sikhs
 14 oktober 2015 ko bahibal kalam gaanv or kotkapur main sikh shantipurvak rosh pradarshan kar rahe the to pradarshnakariyon ko teetar-bitar karne ke liye police ne achaanak goli chalaa di jisamen do pradarshnakariyon kii maut ho gai or kai ghayal hue
 The firing spread anger throughout the Sikh community and the Badal family was engulfed in controversies
 haran kii sikh samudaay ko aashwaasan diya gaya lekin badal sarkaar doshiyon ko giraftaar karne main naakaam rahi kyonki golicond ke peeche darasal police kaa hi haath tha
 In protest against the firing from 1 June 2018, the Insaaf Morcha started an indefinite sit-in demonstration in Bargadi which continued for 192 days
 udhar, captain amarinder singh sarkaar ne satta main aate hi maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die
 The needle of suspicion of the inquiry commission turned to the then Akali Dal government and Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal
 haalanki jaanch main paaya gaya ki police adhikariyon ne bina kisi aadesh ke nihathe logon par goli chalaai thi
 Constitution of SIT for investigation The Captain government also formed a SIT headed by senior police officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh for investigation
 esaiti ne jab poochtacha ke liye purv mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal upmukhyamantri sukhbir singh badal se sampark kiya to akali dal main hadakamp much gaya
 Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh came directly to the target of the Akali Dal
 jaanch aage badi to poochtacha ke liye moga ke tatkaaleen police adheekshak charanjit sharma ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 After him IG Paramraj Singh Umranangal also arrived behind bars
 maamla faridakot kii ek adaalat main vichaaradhin he
 Meanwhile, on the complaint of the Akali Dal, the Election Commission has transferred SIT chief Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh
 maamla phir se tool pakad rahaa he jiske chalate aaj insaaf morcha phir se sangharsh kaa bigul baja diya he

 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress ko uttar pradesh ke baad ek anya rajya main bhi bada jhatka laga he
 The Telugu Desam Party (TDP), which contested assembly elections in alliance with the Congress in Telangana, also does not want to contest the Lok Sabha elections with the party in Andhra Pradesh
 tidipi sutron kii maane to party andhra pradesh main congress ke khilaaf maahaul ko dekhte hue loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav main siton par samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahati
 Chandrababu Naidu met Rahul Gandhi in Delhi It is said that Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP Chief Chandrababu Naidu met Congress President Rahul Gandhi, NCP Chief Sharad Pawar, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 8 January in Delhi
 is maukey par naidu ne kaha tha ki bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ko haraane or desh ko bachaane ke liye sabhi vipakshi dalon kaa ek manch par aana loktantric majaburi he
 In such a situation, the question arises that what happened in this one week that TDP wants to distance itself from the biggest party of anti-bjp alliance in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 isse pehle chandrababu naidu ne november, 2018 main bhi bijepi ke khilaaf taiyaar ho rahe gathbandhan ko majboot karne kii disha main aage badhate hue vibhinn dalon ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii thi
 After which he came out with Congress President Rahul Gandhi while addressing the press and said that all the opposition parties have to come together to save the country
 andhra main congress kho chuki he siyaasi jameen!darasal, andhra vibhaajan ke baad pradesh main upji naaraazgi kaa khamiyaja congress ko bhugatna padaa tha
 The simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha, the Congress sweep
 kabhi congress kaa garh rahe andhra pradesh kii vidhansabha main aaj kii taarikh main na to congress kaa koi vidhayak he or na hi pradesh se congress kaa koi saansad
 Let us know that elections to the Lok Sabha and Assembly are to be held simultaneously in the state
 jaahir he aise main loksabhaa chunaav main congress ke saath gathbandhan karne par party ko vidhansabha chunaav main bhi gathbandhan karnaa padegaa
 4 reasons for TDP not to ally There can be many reasons why TDP is not aligned with Congress
 jisamen pehla kaaran to yahi he ki 2018 ke aakhir main telugana vidhansabha chunaav main congress-tidipi kaa gathbandhan kuch khaas gul nahin khilaa paaya, iske vipareet iskaa ulataa asar dekhne ko mila
 Secondly, there is no guarantee that Congress and TDP votes will be transferred to each other in Andhra Pradesh
 teesraa or sabase ahm kaaran yah he ki rajya main andhra vibhaajan ko lekar congress ke khilaaf abhi bhi naaraazgi he or gathbandhan kii surat main iskaa khamiyaja tidipi ko uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Fourth, that the anti-incumbency vote will be split between the Congress and Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSR Congress by contesting the elections alone, which can directly benefit the TDP
 bataa den ki andhra pradesh main mukhya vipakshi dal wiesar congress ke netaa jaganmohan reddy ne haal hi main apni 340 dinon kii praja sankalp yatra puri kii he, unki is yatra ko acha khaasaa samarthan bhi mila or unki lokapriyata bhi badi he
 Telangana Congress has high command; After Telangana assembly election results, leaders of Congress Telangana unit are also pressurizing the party high command not to tie up with TDP in future
 kyonki iskaa rajya main iskaa ulataa asar dekhne ko mila
 Whereas Congress leaders in Andhra Pradesh believe that once aligned with TDP, the party will be undermined by TDP in the state
 lihaaja party ko rajya main apane dam par chunaav ladate hue apni takat kaa andaja lagaana chahie

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was generally silent, has become quite aggressive against RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 pichley 3 dinon se lagaataar nitish twitor ke jariye lalu prasad par hamale par hamale bol rahe hai
 Today once again, the Chief Minister made a big attack on Lalu Prasad for corruption
 argedy supremeo par tanj kasate huenithish kumaarane twitor par likhaa “bhrashtachar shishtachar he, uske khilaaf karrwai anachar he”
 Through this tweet, Nitish Kumar took a dig at the allegations of corruption against Lalu Prasad and his family
 bhrashtachar shishtachar he
 Action against him is incest !! - Nitish Kumar (@nitishkumar) November 30, 2017 Despite the security of 'Z' Plus and SSG by the state government, the availability of hundreds of security personnel of NSG and CRPF from the central government to keep a check on the people 'S mentality is reflective of courageous personality! - Nitish Kumar (@nitishkumar) November 28, 2017 If sources are to be believed, Nitish Kumaranya is trying to convey the message that corruption is always for Lalu Prasad
 Ishtachar lives and if any action against it if it's action is incest or wrong
 gauratlab he ki vidhansabha ke maujuuda monsoon satr ke dauraan vipaksh sarkaar par kaaphi akramak he or lagaataar bihar main ujagar ho rahe ghotaale ko lekar hallaa bol kii mudra main he
 Especially, given the manner in which Tejashwi Yadav is accusing the government of corruption and scam, this tweet by Nitish Kumar is very important
 jaan kii chintaa, maal-mal kii chintaa,sabase badi deshbhakti he !— Nitish Kumar (@nitishkumar)november 29, 2017is twit ke jarienithishapane sarkaar par ho rahe tikhe hamale kii dhar kam karke waapas lalu prasad or unke parivaar ke upar lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko ujagar kar rahe hai
 Earlier in the last two days, Nitish Kumar tweeted about Lalu's concern after his security was reduced and said that Lalu Prasad uses heavy security to surround him
 upi main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle samaajawaadee party or congress ke bich gathjod ko lekar sthiti saaf nahin ho rahi he
 At the same time, BSP chief Mayawati has also started wrapping the BJP along with these two parties regarding the possibility of an alliance
 haalanki chintaa bhartiya janata party ko bhi kam nahin he
 In the event of sp-congress alliance, Muslim vote bank is expected to be split between this alliance and BSP, while Brahmin vote bank can be split between congress-sp alliance and BJP
 is vajah se basapa or bijepi kaa pareshaan hona lajimi he
 Everything is not right within the Samajwadi Party regarding this alliance
 siem akhilesh yadav or ramgopal yadav kaa khemaa chaah rahaa he ki congress sechunaav purv gathbandhanho jaae
 But SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is not seeking this
 or jab tak netaji kii 'haa' nahin hoti, gathbandhan mumkin nahin he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav feels that his alliance with the Congress will dent his traditional Muslim vote bank
 or 27 saal upi main satta se dur rahi congress party kaa punarjanm ho jayega
 After the Congress was out of power in UP, Mulayam Singh Yadav established the Samajwadi Party as a 'secular party' and prided himself on the minority
 mulaayam singh yadav ko yah bhi lag rahaa he kiakhilesh kaa kad unase badaaho jayega
 For this, the camp of Amar and Shivpal is filling Mulayam's ears
 vaise to congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ko akhilesh yadav se koi parhez nahin he or na hi akhilesh ko rahul se aitraaj he
 But the Congress vice-president has reservations about Mulayam Singh
 agar congress ke saath samaajawaadee party kaa gathjod hota he to is gathbandhan ke jeetne kii sambhaavnaaen prabal ho jaaengi
 Yadav and Muslim vote bank play a decisive role in any election in UP
 agar ye donon partiyaan ekajute hoti hai to muslim or yadav vot ek saath honge hi, obisi vot bank bhi is gathjod ke saath jayega
 CM Akhilesh Yadav has recently announced to bring 17 castes of obcs under the ambit of Scheduled Castes
 soobe main in 17 jatiyon kaa vot bank 14 fisadi he
 However, this news is also floating in the political corridor, Kishivpal Yadav and Amar Singh are seeking an alliance with the Khemakongress
 use yah lag rahaa he ki chunaav se pehle agar yah gathbandhan bana to akhilesh yadav ko khud ko mukhyamantri ke taur par project karnaa aasaan nahin hoga
 This camp is trying to make Akhilesh not be the face of coalition in elections
 amar singh kii congress se achche rishte hai or bataaya ja rahaa he ki wo gathjod ke liye madhyasth kii bhoomika main hai
 Rallod is also expected to be involved in this alliance
 ralod adhyaksh ajit singh se shivpal singh ke to rishte achche hai hin, amar singh se bhi unki banati he
 However, the political mist of the sp's alliance with the Congress is yet to be seen
 1991 main purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi bhi sapa pramukh ke saath gathbandhan kii koshish main naakaam sabit hue the
 Once, Mulayam Singh Yadav promised Rajiv Gandhi to declare an alliance in Lucknow and left for Delhi the next morning
 mulaayam ne vidhansabha bhang kar apane dam par chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kar di jisase congress ko kaaphi niraashaa hui thi
 History is witness that whenever the alliance was discussed between the two parties, it was done only to keep BJP away from power in the state

 The question arises that when training is given to an ASHA worker, how to do counseling of people is also told
 seve da children main senior technoligical adwiser dow
 Rajesh Khanna says, 'counseling is also done for the health workers present in the center
 lekin aksar counselling ke abhaav main garbhvatee ko puri jaankaree nahin mil paati
 'this case is a hallmark that full antenatal care is not being provided to the pregnant women for prenatal treatment
 yani agar auraton tak dawaaen pahunch bhi jaati hai to thik tarah se counselling na hone ke kaaran auraten in dawaaiyon ko nahin letin
 According to the report of the National Family Health Survey-4, 16 in rural areas
 7 pratishat mahilaayein hi antinetal care le paati hai
 While in urban areas this figure 31
 1 pratishat he
 These figures are also surprising because many programs are being run by the government for pregnant women
 rashtriya gramin swasthya mishan (2005)
 'janani Suraksha Yojana', 'child Safety Program', 'prime Minister's Safe Motherhood Campaign' was also announced in June 2016 by the Prime Minister in 'man Ki Baat'

 If the figures of the Global Nutrition Report 2017 are also mixed with these figures, then the picture that will be formed may be an issue of 'national shame' for a country
 global neutrishan report 2017 ke anusaar prajnan kshamta vaali umr kii 51 fisadi auraten anaemic hai
 The reasons cited for not receiving antenatal care in the National Family Health Survey-4 reflect the sleeping attitude of a country like India

 19 percent of the family feel that this is not necessary

 About 10 percent of the women themselves do not want any kind of checkup

 More than two percent of women are unable to get a checkup due to the absence of a health worker

 Especially in villages, there is a belief that no one should be told about pregnancy for three months
 auraten pregnancy ke bare main discus karne se bhi sharmaati hai
 They do not even know who they should go to talk to? Family members are also often less aware
 haalanki ab jaagarukta aa rahi he
 On the other hand, the government system is also responsible for this

 However, questions are being raised on the timing of Suryaprakash Meena's decision not to contest the election, as the minister came to the BJP state office in Bhopal with a crowd of his supporters a few days ago and during the conversation with Aaj Tak, he described himself as a strong contender for the ticket
 Was, but according to sources, after getting the red signal for the ticket from the high command, Meena decided for herself a respectful farewell before the election

 On Thursday, the Congress party has criticized the BJP amidst political turmoil in Karnataka
 rajya congress pramukh dinesh gundu raav (karnataka Political Crisis) ne kaha ki ham bijepi ke un sabhi vidhayakon kaa dil se swaagat karte hai jo beete kuch dinon se dilli ke paas ek aaleeshaan hotel main chuttee bitaane ke baad waapas aa rahe hai
 After the holiday everyone will be energetic and i hope to return to work soon for the people of their area
 unhone is babat ek twit bhi kiya
 Let us tell you that amidst the political turmoil in Karnataka (karnataka Political Crisis), BJP had kept more than 100 of its mlas in a hotel in Gurugram to protect them from horse trading
 We extend a hearty welcome to all Karnataka BJP mlas who are returning home after an extended holiday at a luxury resort near Delhi
 Now that they are sufficiently rejuvenated let us hope they will attend to the work of their constituencies which they have neglected for long
 dhyaan ho ki beete kuch dinon main karnatakamein sattarudh congress-jad(es) gathbandhan or bhaajapa ke bich aarope-pratyarope or bad gaya
 Both camps are leaving no stone unturned to keep their mlas united
 sattarum gathbandhan main shaamil dalon ne bhaajapa par sarkaar giraane kaa kathith rup se prayaas karne kaa aarope lagaaya thajbaki bhaajapa ke vidhayak kharid farokht ke prayaason ke dar se gurugram ke ek resort main bane hue hai
 State Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy had said that the situation was under 'control' and there was nothing to worry about
 congress sutron ke anusaar, party ke kuch mantriyon ne vyapak hit main va atoot gathbandhan banaae rakhane ke liye istife kii peshkash kii thi
 It is not yet known how long the bjp's 104 mlas will stay in the resort
 ye vidhayak party ke rashtriya adhiveshan main shaamil hone dilli gaye the, lekin ab gurugram main maujuud hai
 Meanwhile, sources had told that bjp's Karnataka unit chief BS Yeddyurappa can meet the party mlas at the resort to discuss the current situation in the state
 unhone kaha tha ki bhaajapa vidhayak party ke sheersh netaaon se karnataka lautne kii hari jhandi milane tak gurugram main hi rukenge
 About 20 young Congress workers led by Haryana Pradesh Congress General Secretary Pradeep Singh shouted slogans against the NDA government outside the resort
 pradarshan karne waalon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki bhaajapa desh main ‘‘samvidhan kaa apmaan kar rahi he or loktantr kii hatya'' kar rahi he
 Karnataka Chief Minister Kumaraswamy denied any 'campaign' of horse-trading by BJP ruling mlas in Bengaluru, saying there was no need and that they had sufficient strength
 kumaraswami ne kaha tha ki ‘sabakuch niyantran main he
 
 
 There is nothing to worry about
 'kumaraswami se poocha gaya tha ki kya sattarum gathbandhan bhi bhaajapa ke vidhayakon ko rijhaane ke liye abhiyaan chalaaegi
 The Kumaraswamy government suffered a setback on Tuesday when two independent mlas withdrew their support
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki vah bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh bi es yediurppa se poochna chaahate hai ki unki party ke vidhayakon ko makar sankranti manaane ke liye le jaaya gaya he yaa kisi anya kaaran se
 The Chief Minister clarified that contrary to media reports, the mlas of his party are not being taken to any resort
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham kisi ko resort main lekar nahin ja rahe hai, isaki koi jarurat nahin he
 That is why i request the media not to fool themselves and the people of the state

 He said, 'we have many mantras here in which the' laws of motion 'have been codified long before Newton discovered them
 isliye, yah aavashyak he ki paramparaagat gyaan hamaare paathyakram main shaamil kiye jaaen
 'many Union Ministers and State Education Ministers were also involved in this meeting
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki sahi shiksha dene ke liye yah jaruri he ki har imaarat ko vaastu ke anuroop banwaaya jaae
 Significantly, Satyapal Singh is no less educated person
 vah purv ipies hai or mumbai ke police kamishnar jaise pad par rah chuke hai
 Earlier Satyapal Singh had said that 'charles Darwin's theory of human development is scientifically wrong
 is niyam ko paathyakram main badalane kii jarurat he
 Man has always been a human since he saw the earth
 ' satyapal singh ne yah baat ol india vaidic sammelan main hissaa lene ke dauraan kahi thi

 Pakistan's new High Commissioner Salman Bashir was hoping for a fast-track route for his credentials so that he could attend the india-pakistan Foreign Secretaries meeting on 4-5 June
 lekin videsh mantralay ne vinamrata se yah kehete hue inkaar kar diya ki credentials seremani ke liye kam se kam paanch rajdooton kaa hona jaruri he
 On the other hand, President Pratibha Patil's term is about to end, so he is busy in finishing his unfinished business at this time
 haalanki bharat ne protocol ko darkinar karte hue bataur objarwar unhen bharat-pakistan ke bich ho rahi dotarafa baatcheet ke dauraan baithne kii ijaajat di thi
 Pakistan's soft-spoken former foreign secretary Salman Bashir arrived in Delhi to take over from the current High Commissioner Shahid Malik
 dilli main paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa karne ke baad malik june main islamabad laut gaye
 On arrival, Basheer was welcomed by the arrest of Syed Zabiuddin Ansari's partner Abu Jandal and his confession that Pakistan was behind the 26 / 11 attacks
 bashir ne iske pehle 26 / 11 ke hamalon ke peeche pakistan kaa haath hone se jude bharat ke sabooton ko 'mahaj ek kahani' bataaya tha
 Bashir will be considered Pakistan's designated High Commissioner to India without meeting the President
 is tarah ve na saarvajanik samarohon main ja sakate hai, na media ke saath baatcheet kar sakate hai or na hi aadhikarik baatcheet main ucchayukta kii bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai
 India's biggest official in London has also had a similar destiny
 march main pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne jaimini bhagwati ko landan main bharat kaa ucchayukta niyukt kiya, lekin maharani elizabeth ko abhi tak unke credentials grahan karne kaa samay nahin mila he
 India and Britain have deep ties
 donon deshon ke bich kootnithik sambandhon main abhi tak koi daraar nahin padi he
 But it is heard that Buckingham Palace is upset that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did not accept the invitation to Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee ceremony, citing earlier commitments in June
 british ucchayukta ke pravaktaa ne india today se kahah ''bharat ke nae ucchayukta sanyog se un dinon main aae hai jab maharani atyadhik vyast hai
 According to Buckingham Palace, Bhagwati will be called upon to present her credentials as soon as the first opportunity comes
 is bich ve united kingdom main rajnatik, aarthik or saanskrithik gatividhiyon main bharat ke sabase varisht rajanyik ke rup main kaary kar sakate hai,jo unki mahatvapurn bhoomika ko dekhte hue jaruri he
 But until then, like Bashir, he too will have to wait for the formalities to be completed

 dilli sarkaar kii ore se har varsh milane vaala fund jo emsidi dwaara dilli ke alag-alag kshetra ke vikaas main lagaaya jaataa he, usamen dilli sarkaar ne is baar lagbhag 80 pratishat tak kii katautee kar di he, jisase takreeban chal rahe sabhi projects par brake lag gaya he
 These range from the construction of streets, roads to the construction of hospitals and multilevel parking
 dakshini dilli nagar nigam ke meyar narendra chawla ne dilli sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki dilli sarkaar, nigam ko thap karnaa chaahati he
 Due to this move of the government, many projects of South Delhi Municipal Corporation have been halted due to lack of funds
 meyar ne kejariwal sarkaar ke is kadam par durbhaavna se kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 However, the Municipal Corporation of South Delhi had sought Rs 904 crore from the Delhi government for the development works for the year 2017-18
 jabaki nigam ko dilli sarkaar dwaara ek paisa bhi nahi mila
 80 crores sought for health, nothing was found
 Meyer Narendra Chawla said that 80 crores were demanded from Kejriwal government for improving healthcare, in which Delhi government did not give a single penny
 vahiin shiksha ke kshetra main vikaas ke liye 255 karod maanga gaya tha, jis par dilli sarkaar ne 90 karod rupee diya
 340 million was sought by the corporation for transport, on which the Delhi government gave only 48 crore rupees
 agar ham nigam dwaara kul maange gaye fund ki baat karen to 1,579 karod main se keval 138 karod rupee hi dilli sarkaar kii ore se die gaye
 Whereas Kejriwal government had given Rs 558 crore to South MCD last year
 emsidi main fund kii kami he to fund detii kyon nahin sarkardusri ore, dakshini dilli ke aap vidhayak saurabh bharadwaj ne mana he ki south emsidi ke paas fund kii kami he
 In such a situation, Saurabh is willing to give money from his MLA fund
 lekin sawaal uthta he ki agar dilli sarkaar maanati he ki emsidi main fund kii kami he to fund detii kyon nahin
 At the same time, Congress leader Abhishek Dutt hit back, saying that today the situation has become that the councilor cannot even make the drain of his area
 unhone saurabh bharadwaj par raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 In fact, the truth is that the Delhi government has reduced the share of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation by increasing its share in the account of the East MCD

 It is noteworthy that even before this, Shahid has spoken many times on the issue related to Kashmir

 Shahid wrote, "the situation in India's occupied Kashmir is becoming fragile

 ''bataa den, ruthik kii bahan sunaina roshan bhi cancer ke khilaaf jang lard chuki hai
 20 years ago, as a 24-year-old journalist during the Kargil War in July 1999, i flew three times in the Mirage 2000 fighter bomb aircraft of the Indian Air Force
 behad oonche or durgam ilaake main ho rahi ladaai main bhartiya vayusena kii bhoomika se judi khabaron ko karne ke liye kuch sakht niyam banaae gaye the - mujhe kabhi bhi miraj vimaanon main lage ek israeli kit ke mahatvapurn hisse ke bare main report nahin kerani thi jise maine dekha yaa uske bare main suna
 This was a complex modification that helped the Indian Air Force carry out precise bombing in such inaccessible terrain
 upkaran kaa vah mukhya tukdaa isroyal litning lager diziner pod tha, jo ek adrishy beam ke saath lakshya ko bhedata tha
 The route of this beam was essentially followed by laser-guided bombs
 bam lager ko trek karte hai or prabhaav ke thik chaynit bindu par udaan bharte hai
 On 24 June 1999, Mirage 2000, led by Wing Commander Raghunath Nambiar, dropped bombs on Pakistani Army bases at the top of Tiger Hill
 bhartiya vayusena ke is hamale ke kuch minute baad lakshya ko dhwast kar diya gaya
 In this war, laser guided munitions were used by the Indian Air Force for the first time in the war
 24 june 2019 ko tiger hill hamale kii 20 varshganth par bhartiya vayusena ne miraj ko kaise ekikrut kiya gaya, is par vistaar se jaankaree di
 Some of it was first reported by The Indian Express on the 18th anniversary of the Kargil War
 bhartiya vayusena ke pashchimi vaayu kaman ke air marshall raghunatha nambiar kehete hai ki litaning pod or 1,000 pound lager nirdeshit bamon ke ekikaran ko baahar dinon main puraa kiya gaya tha
 In 1997, two years before the Kargil war, India signed a contract for the Israeli pod
 iske tahat jaguaar vimaa ke liye pandrah or miraj 2000 ke liye paanch pod kharide jane the
 These were used in conjunction with the us-supplied Paveway Laser Guided Bomb Kit
 lekin 1998 main pokharan parmaanu pareekshanon ke baad america pratibandhon ke parinamswaroop, bharat ne kabhi bhi un fus ko praapt nahin kiya, jinhen pevvebamon kaa kaam karne kii aavashyaktaa thi
 What's more, the software associated with the Mirage 2000's Hithayar delivery system was never modified since the aircraft was acquired from France in 1985
 'hamen israel kii madad mili' aisa kahana he air marshall nambier kaa
 He pointed to a process where technical experts from Israel worked with the Indian Air Force's Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE) to prepare the litting / pavement combination for the attacks in Kargil
 ve kehete hai ki ekikaran ke saath teen samasyaayein thim
 We had never integrated the Litening Pod, the paveway was not ready and we did not have the correct fuses
 bhartiya vayusena kii samasyaon ko sulajhane kii prakriya ek din baad nahin ho sakati thi
 Indian Air Force combat aircraft, such as the mig-27 and mig-21, were not able to accurately hit their targets at the heights of Kargil
 pakistani mixilon kii sataha se hawa main maar karne vaali mixilon (esaem) ke sampark main aane ke baad se hi unhen nishaanaa banane or maar giraane ke liye bahut kareeb se udana tha
 Two IAF aircraft, including the mig-21 fighter and Mi-17 helicopter, went missing, killing five Air Force personnel
 miraj 2000 apgrade bengalooru main shuru hua or gwalior tak jari rahaa, jahaan bhartiya vayusena apane miraj 2000 squadran kaa base he
 June 24, 1 xxrep 4 9 was d Day
 subah 6:30 minute par teen miraj 2000 ne punjab ke adampur se udaan bhari
 Air Marshal Nambier, who was given the responsibility of dropping the Paveway laser bomb on Tiger Hill, said that Tiger Hill was seen from a distance of about 50 km in the Litoning Pod and we were thrilled to see that there was not a single cloud around the hill 
 unhone kaha ki mainen sidhe aircraft take lagane ke liye hending badal di thi
 On Tiger Hill i was shown a set of seven arctic tendons
 air marshall nambier ne kaha ki tiger hill 16,600 feet kii oonchai par sthit he
 The fighters descended to 28,000 feet, their intended altitude for attack, but they had to fly low as the wind intensified at this altitude
 tiger hill par hamalaa shuru ho gaya tha
 He said that at a distance of 28 kilometers i left the laser to set the target for the first time
 litning pod ne turant lakshya kii duuri tay kii
 i repeatedly specified the target again
 relies range main, maine trigar dabaaya or hamen laga ki vimaan main upar kii taraf achaanak 600 kilogram bhaar aa gaya he
 He said that under the conditions of delivery the flight time of a laser-guided bomb, which we dropped it to, was within thirty seconds, but for us in the cockpit it appeared as an eternity
 ham itane khush the ki hamen pataa nahin tha ki lakshya kii puri video chhavi ek dhvaniviheen visphot main fat gai thi
 That video was first broadcast on NDTV
 or yah dekhte hi dekhte antarrashtriya surkhiyaan ban chukaa tha
 At the same time it clearly demonstrated the potential of India
 # crosshair on # tigerhill : 24 June 1999- 2xmirage2000, in the first-ever combat use of laser-guided Bombs (LGB) by the IAF, struck & destroyed the Pak Infantry's Command & Control bunkers on Tiger Hill
 # rememberingkargil @ drsubhashmos @ nsitharamanoffc The integration of the Litening Pod with the Paveway Bomb was a resounding success
 nambiar ne aath lager gided bamon main se paanch ko launch kiya jo ki kargil ke dauraan bhartiya vayusena dwaara daage gaye the
 This was not the last time that Littingan and Pavave would be used against the Pakistani Army
 teen saal baad, 2 agast, 2002 ko, bhartiya or pakistani sena ne sansad par aatankwaadi hamale ke baad apana gatirodh samaapt karne ke kuch maheene baad, IAF ne jammu kashmir ke kel sector main ek rij line par khaali nahin kiye gaye pakistani post ko nishaanaa banaaya jo bhartiya kshetra ke lagbhag chaar kilometre andar tha
 IAF Air Officer Commanding in Central Command chief Rajesh Kumar said that the message we received was about not tolerating any kind of rubbish
 rajesh kumaar chaar miraj 2000 ke payalton main se ek the, jo pakistani post par hit karne ke liye tainaat the
 Which were 12,000 feet
 air marshall kumaar ne kaha ki hamaare do uddeshy the - unhen ek sandesh bhejein
 But we did not want to start a war
 hamaara nishaanaa yah sunishchit kar rahaa tha ki bam apane lakshya ko sateek rup se maaren
 If you missed a ridge, you would destroy Kell (a village in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) itself
 ab tak, bhartiya vaayu sena ne apane litingen pods or lager-gided bamon ko unnat kiya tha
 These were used to clear the ridge line of Pakistani intruders in an operation that the Indian Air Force has never officially called to date

 Ronnie was sure about the sapphire seen in this photo taken at the Philips Auction House, which is the same gem that once owned his company but which was stolen from a hotel in Milan two decades ago
 roni ne ffp ko pichley hafte die gaye intervyuu main kaha- maine certificate dekha or mujhe laga ki yah to vahi he, vahi he

 The fact that this gem is smaller than the one stolen from him 19 years ago does not in any way move Ronnie from his faith
 kyonki, aksar ratna churaane vaale unhen kaant chhaant kar unke vajan or shape ko kam badhati karte hai
 After receiving this invitation, Ronnie contacted Phillips and spoke
 saath main is ratna kaa insurance karne vaali company se bhi sampark kiya

 All this story, or rather, Pachada started from 1996, when Horowitz and Parrot (H&T) jewelers presented an auction of the Karsher Bracelet in which 65
 16 carat kaa vishuddh kashmiri neelam bhi pesh kiya gaya
 It was tremendous due to its erosion and brightness

 yah tathy ki yah ratna us 19 saal pehle chori hue ratna se chota he, vaali baat bhi roni ko kisi bhi tarah se apane vishwaas se nahin hilaati
 Because, often those who steal the gems by pruning them increase their weight and shape less
 yah nimantran milane ke baad roni ne philips se sampark kiya or apni baat rakhi
 Also approached the company that insured this gem
 jab insurance waalon ne bhi philiphs se sampark kiya to to pataa chalaa ki yah neelam neuyork main is ratna ke tathakthith or, jiskaa khulaasa nahin kiya gaya he, maalik ko waapas bheja ja chukaa he

 Let us tell you that during a rally in Tral area some people waved the flag of Pakistan
 jisase naaraaz rajya ke mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said ne doshiyon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii baat kahi thi
 Talking to reporters after the Chief Minister's statement, Hurriyat Conference spokesman Ayaz Akbar quoted Geelani as saying, "only the party's flag was put up at the rally in Tral but some over-zealous youths flagged Pakistan during this time
" Waved
 ye jammu-kashmir ke liye koi nai baat nahin he kyonki kashmir ke log pakistan se pyaar karte hai

 The spokesperson argued that the half-moon and stars in the Pakistani flag and the Hurriyat Conference flag are similar, which is just a coincidence as these symbols have been associated with Islam for a long time

 The proposed Beef and Pork Festival at Jawaharlal Nehru University has become more controversial after Osmania University's Beef Festival became controversial
 jeenyu ke samaaroh se bijepi sidhe jud gai he or usne is samaaroh ke aayojan kii taiyaari kar rahe logon ko dhamkee di he
 Hindu terrorism can be smelled behind this threat
 hindutv kii takaton ko mukhya samasya gaay ke maance se he, boar ke maance se nahin
 If JNU students had only organized pork (pork) festival then they would not have any problem
 ab puri duniya is baat ko samaj gai he ki hindu brahmanwad kis tarah se khan-paan kii samskruti ke dwaara jatigat oonch-neech ko banaae hue he
 They have adopted a dictatorial method of food
 kya utpaadak jansamooh ko apana pasandida khaanaa khaane kaa bhi adhikaar nahin he? hindutv ke is gomance virdohi agenda ko gau sangrakshan ke gandhivadi rashtravaadi agenda se or majbootee mili he
 Three types of animals are reared in homes all over India: buffalo, bull and cow
 gaay ko aise pashu ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo sandon se prajnan karti he or bail kheti ke kaam aate hai
 The bulls are used for plowing and pulling bullock carts
 bhens ko doodh utpaadan ke liye paala jaataa he
 When they do not object to the use of buffalo for food, on what basis do they prevent the bull from coming into the food? Surprisingly, they have no problem killing buffaloes, while buffaloes meet 75% of our milk needs
 yahi brahmanwad he
 Gandhi talked of cow protection, considering it as a milking animal, but he himself only drank goat's milk
 ab kheti yantric ho chuki he, gau vansh kii sankhya ko logon kii khaadya suraksha badhaane main istemaal karnaa chahie
 If a large number of people (who do not find beef prohibited) are not allowed to eat it, the country may face a crisis of cultural conflict
 utpaadak jansamooh or vishvavidhyalayon main padhgaye vaale unke bachche aakhir brahmanvaadi aadesh kaa paalan kyon karen?asli chunauti bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon ke shikshakon ke saamne he
 After all, how can university, IIT, IIM faculty follow the Hindutva ideology of vegetarianism? Many employees come from a family background who are vegetarian or eat a particular meat or fish but do not eat beef
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki ve campus yaa mess menu main oonchi jati ke saanskrithik aadhipaty vaali taanaashaahee thope jane ke prati udasin rahen
 Why should students from Dalit / OBC / tribal and religious minority sections be deprived of their favorite food? The question is not how many people eat beef or pork, the question is whether a student also has the right to eat the food of his choice and whether he should be given this right or not? JNU teachers, considered to be world-class intellectuals, should support their vision of food rights

 Teams of Dalit leaders compare the achievements of the government among the society and the steps taken for the Dalit community in the era of opposition parties

 ab shrinivasana desh kii sabase badi adaalat ke saamne khadey hai
 Now what is the strategy for the rest of the people
 yadi supreme court shrinivasana ko clin chit de de to vah dobaaraa adhyaksh banenge, lekin yadi aisa nahin hua to phir shatranj kii bisaat bichhegi, or yaheen shuru hogi bhartiya cricket main raajnneeti, jisane mere jaise raajnneetik samvaadadaata ko bisisiai cover karne ke liye prerit kiya

 input- ieenes The current chapter in Karnataka's politics finally ended in a 99 reverie
 18 july se chal rahi bahes ke baad karnataka main congress-jedies kii kumaraswami kii sarkaar vishwaas mat hasil nahin kar saki or unhen istipha dena pad gaya
 Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy tried hard to save this government from falling, but failed to save the government
 yah sarkaar mahaj 426 din hi chal saki
 HD Kumaraswamy's government was able to get only 99 votes in the 224-member Assembly while the opposition got 105 votes
 kumaraswami hi akele aise nahin he jo 99 ke pher main pade or ghate main chale gaye
 Let's take a look when a party or people got stuck in 99 turns and got into trouble
 congress ke liye ek or 99 kaa pherkarnataka main sarkaar bachaane kii parde kii peeche kii lakh koshishon ke baad bhi sarkaar paksh main 99 mat hi hasil kar saki or sarkaar gir gai
 However, the Congress, which had been a partner in the government, has been stuck in the earlier rounds
 pichley saal rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav main congress bijepi ko haraane main kaamyaab rahi, lekin 200 sadasyeey vidhansabha seat main 199 siton par hue chunaav main congress ke khate main 99 siten hi ain or vah bahumat se 1 seat dur rah gai, jabaki bijepi ko 73 siton se hi santosh karnaa padaa
 The Congress needed 100 seats to form the government, later the party managed to form the government with the support of the BSP, which won 6 seats
 haalanki baad main ek seat par hue upachunaav main jeet hasil kar congress ne 100 ke aankade ko paar kar liya
 BJP has also seen the HD Kumaraswamy government may have fallen after getting stuck in 99 changes, but a similar situation came to the Bharatiya Janata Party about a year and a half ago when the BJP was reduced to 2 points in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly elections
 It means that it has got 99 seats in its account
 gujarat main narendra modi yug ke shuru hone ke baad rajya main party kaa yah sabase kharaab pradarshan rahaa or yah tab hua jab unke desh ke pradhanmantri rahete party ne chunaav ladaa
 Also, ever since BJP came to power in Gujarat, it has had its poor performance
 99 ke pher main bhi sachin tendulkar 'master'99 kaa pher behad bura hota he or cricket ke maidan main ise behad naapsand kiya jaataa he

 Sachin is the only batsman in ODI cricket who has been dismissed for the score of 99 runs not one, not two but 3 times
 sachin tendulkar ek hi saal (2007) main 3 baar 99 ke score par out hue
 On 26 June 2007, he failed to convert his 99 score to 100 against South Africa, then against England on 24 August and against Pakistan on 8 November and set a world record

 a score of 99 will always remain unpalatable for spin bowler Shane Warne, who showed his magic, as he reached a century for the first time in Test history, but was dismissed for a score of 99 and his dream remained incomplete
 30 november 2001 ko perth test main newjiland ke khilaaf vah 99 ke score se aage nahin bad sake
 After this change, Warne played 50 more Test matches, but he could never cross the score

 Mohammad Azharuddin and Lokesh Rahul are also the only Indian batsmen to be dismissed for a score of 199 in Tests
 99 test match khilne vaale ajaharuddin apane test kariyar main kabhi bhi 199 ran se zyada kaa score nahin kar sake or yahi pari unke kariyar kii sabase badi pari banakar rah gai

 shakurabsti kii jhuggi main ravivaar raat 1 baje kadaake kii thand ke bich ek bacchee kaa janm hua, jab parivaar ke sir par jhuggi kaa saaya bhi nahin rahaa
 But why did this happen? Mithlesh Pathak, Cluster Coordinator of Delhi Government Cabinet Minister Satyendra Jain, says that every time a notice came, the minister would save his slum, but this time everything happened so quickly that there was no chance
 sabko pataa tha ki jhuggi par talwaar latak rahi he or sthaneey vidhayak or mantri satyendra jain dhaal bane khadey hai
 Not only this, many attempts were also made to carry an electricity meter
 log kehete hai ki jab bhi bijli vibhaag vaale meter kholane aate the, ham unako bhaga dete the
 This time he was with the police force
 pehle bijli kaati, meter kholaa or phir hamaare ashiyane par bulldozer chalaa
 The comments isi jhuggi main rahane vaale pramod ne bataaya ki kareeb do maheene pehle bhi jhuggi todane kaa notice mila tha
 We went to Jain Sahab and our slum was saved
 jhuggi hataane kii dedline baar-baar badhati rahi
 This time also the notice was pasted, but the action was so fast that there was no chance of intervening
 kareeb teen kilometre ke ilaake main faile 500 jhuggiyon ko lekar shuukravaar ko kuchhek gini chuni jagahon par notice chipkaai gai or phir shanivaar subah dhahaane kii karrwai hui
 Apparently, this time Satyendra Jain was defeated and slum was destroyed in this hide and seek
 agar dilli sarkaar ko jhuggi bachaane se zyada phikr logon ko basaane kii hoti to naa ek maasoom kii jaan jaati naa hi itnaa bavaal machataa or naa hi is thithurati thand main garmai siyasat par haath senkane kaa mauka miltaa
 Everyone knew that the sword is hanging on the slum and local MLA and Minister Satyendra Jain is standing as a shield
 yahi nahin bijli kaa meter le jane kii bhi kai koshishen ho chuki thi
 People say that whenever the electricity department meters came to open, we used to drive them away
 is baar wo police bal ke saath the
 First cut the power, opened the meter and then bulldozer went on our house
 tippaniyan Pramod, who lives in the same slum, said that about two months ago, the slum breaking notice was received
 ham jain sahab ke paas gaye or hamaari jhuggi batch gai
 The slum removal deadline continued to grow
 is baar bhi notice chipkaaya gaya, lekin karrwai itani tej hui ki bich-bachaav kaa mauka nahin mila
 On 500 slums spread over an area of about three kilometers, notices were sent to some of Guinea's selected places on Friday and then on Saturday morning, the demolition action took place
 jaahir he ujaadne or bachaane kii is ankhmichauli main is baar satyendra jain maat kha gaye or jhuggi ujaad gai
 If the Delhi government had to settle people more anxious than to save the slum, then neither an innocent would have been killed nor there would have been a chance to shake hands on this hot state in this cold winter
 isi jhuggi main rahane vaale pramod ne bataaya ki kareeb do maheene pehle bhi jhuggi todane kaa notice mila tha

 " jis mamata banerjee ne 2008 main tata ko singoor chhodkar jane ko majaboor kar diya tha usee mamata banerjee ne ab tata se kaha he ki agar vah gambhir he to bengal main aakar udyog shuru kar saktaa he
 On Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee returned land papers to farmers in Singur and invited industrialist Tata to set up a fresh factory elsewhere in the state
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki ''gualatod (pashchim midanapur) main hamaare paas 1000 acre jameen he
 This land belongs to the government, not the farmers
 is jameen par agar kaarkaana lagaana chahen, tata ho yaa bmadblu , vah hamaari sarkaar se baat kar saktaa he
 '' san 2008 main kisaanon ke andolan ke baad tata ko apni mini car naino kaa kaarkaana singoor se hataakar gujarat ke sanand main lagaana padaa
 Mamta Banerjee was the face of this protest as the opposition leader
 lekin ab pashchim bengal sarkaar rajya main udyogon kii raftaar badhaane ke liye tata ko kahin or jameen dene ke liye taiyaar he
 Mamta Banerjee has spoken of giving 1000 acres of land in West Midnapore of Bengal to the Tata, the state government is also saying that 600 acres in Purulia, 800 acres in Kharagpur and 700 acres in Bardhaman are for industries
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the opposition is saying that Mamata Banerjee is only building an air fort
 pashchim bengal congress ke pramukh adheer ranjan choudhary ne kaha ki pashchim midanapur ilaake main koi bhi udyogpati kaarkaana lagane nahin aayega
 Chaudhary told NDTV India, "what does Mamata Banerjee think that Tata will be willing to come there
" gualatod maowad prabhavit ilaaka he
 There Tata will get landmine and bomb will be found somewhere
 '' choudhary ne yah bhi kaha ki mamata banerjee jis land-bank kii baat kar rahi hai vah ek bhulaava he
 "nowhere in the state is there a thousand acres of land together
" kahin ek kaththa jameen he to phir usase ek kilometre dur dhai kattha jameen milegi
 Simultaneous land is not meant to be given to industries
 '' In fact, Tata is now seeking compensation from the government in exchange for land in Singur
 sarkaar cash muaavje ke badale jameen kaa prastaav de rahi he
 Mamta Banerjee created a farmer-friendly image by opposing Tata's factory in Singur and the Chemical Hub in Nandigram, but now it is necessary to give such a message to promote investment in the state
 kaha ja rahaa he ki banerjee kii yah koshish isi muhim kaa hissaa he
 Mamta Banerjee said, "we have 1000 acres of land in Gualtod (west Midnapore)
 yah jameen kisaanon kii nahin sarkaar kii he
 If you want to set up a factory on this land, be it Tata or BMW, he can talk to our government
 '' After the farmers' agitation in 2008, Tata had to move his mini car Nano from Singur to a plant in Sanand, Gujarat
 mamata banerjee vipakshi netaa ke taur par is virodh pradarshan kaa cheharaa raheen
 But now the government of West Bengal is ready to give land elsewhere to Tata to speed up the industries in the state
 mamata banerjee ne tata ko bengal ke pashchim midanapur main 1000 acre jameen dene kii baat to kahi hi he, rajya sarkaar yah bhi kah rahi he ki purulia main 600 acre, khadgpur main 800 acre or bardhaman main 700 acre jameen udyogon ke liye he
 The comments udhar vipaksh kah rahaa he ki mamata banerjee sirf hawaii kile bana rahi hai
 West Bengal Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary said that no industrialist would come to the West Midnapore area to set up a factory
 choudhary ne enditivi india se kaha ki ''mamata banerjee kya sochati hai ki tata kya vahaan aane ko taiyaar hoga
 Gualtod is a Maoist-affected area
 vahaan tata ko kahin landmine milegaa to kahin bam milegaa
 "chaudhary also said that the land-bank that Mamata Banerjee is talking about is a mistake
" ''rajya main kahin bhi ek hajaar acre jameen ek saath nahin he
 If there is a hard land somewhere, then one kilometer and a half away from it will get a piece of land
 ek saath jameen udyogon ko dene ke liye nahin he
 '' asal main tata singoor main jameen ke badale ab sarkaar se muaavja maang rahaa he
 The government is proposing land in lieu of cash compensation
 mamata banerjee ne singoor main tata ke kaarkaane or nandigram main chemical hub kaa virodh kar kisaan hitaishi chhavi to bana lee lekin ab rajya main nivesh ko badhaava dene ke liye aisa sandesh dena jaruri he
 It is being said that this attempt of Banerjee is part of this campaign

 As Patil's tenure saw the 'fab Five', 57 new cricketers shone in the cricket sky, with 12 cricketers getting the Test, 21 odis and 24 T-20s wearing Team India's jersey
 patil ne hi shikhar dhawan or jasprit bumraah jaise khilaadiyon ko mauka diya, mohammad shami or keel rahul jaise khilaadi bhi unki parkhi nazaron se hi chamake
 When Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh's career was considered to be over, he got a chance to play in 2015, led by Sandeep Patil, Ashish Nehra made a different identity again
 patil jab tak kursi par rahe team isisi ke saare muqablon main semifinal tak pahunchi, maujuuda daur main team test maichon main sirf ek ank ke faasale se number 2 par he, to vanade main number teen par, tii-20 main bhi team duusare number par he

 Things get tricky when you sit in the chair of the selector
 khaaskar jab aap varisht khilaadiyon kii form, fitness par charchaa karte hai
 We made some good, but tough decisions
 mujhe khushi he aaj bhartiya cricket team jis mukaam par khadi he use dekhakar khud par or apane saathiyon par garv hota he
 " 1996 main patil bhartiya team ke coach bhi the, lekin mahaj 6 maheene main unhen pad chhodana padaa
 Later, it was a big achievement for a team like Kenya to reach the semi-finals of the 2003 World Cup as a coach
 sandip patil 2012 main mukhya chayankarta bane the, newjiland ke khilaaf unhone aakhri baar bhartiya team kaa chayan kiya, lekin yah bhi saaf kiya ki bataur chayankarta unke kai achche dost chhot gaye
 They may also include big names who farewell to him during his tenure
 sandip phir se bhartiya team kaa coach bhi bananaa chaahate the, lekin board se unhen intervyuu tak ke liye bulaava tak nahin bheja gaya
 Whether it was to crush 'captain Cool' Dhoni to a format, or to ask Sachin for the farewell test, everyone was on the Zimma Patil-led selection committee

 It was Patil who gave a chance to players like Shikhar Dhawan and Jaspreet Bumrah, players like Mohammed Shami and KL Rahul also shone through his eyes

 As long as Patil remained on the chair, the team reached the semi-finals in all ICC matches, in the current round the team is ranked number 2 in Test matches by just one point, then number three in odis, also in T20

 Especially when you discuss the form, fitness of senior players
 hamane kuch achche, lekin kade faisle liye
 i am glad to see the position on which the Indian cricket team is standing today and they are proud of themselves and their teammates

 In this case, limit the scope of your expectations

 The wind blows after marriage Love is bitter but true
 shaadi ke kuch samay baad pyaar dhire-dhire kam hone lagata he
 Actually, you keep trying to keep pace with the husband and his family
 is dauraan aapako sabakuch bahut mushakil lagane lagata he, jisase wo sari romani baaten bemaani lagane lagati hai, jinke bare main aap shaadi se pehle sochaa karti thim

 Bajitpur village in Delhi resonated with gunshots when some assailants in the Swift vehicle fired several rounds of bullets at a man named Monu
 monu apane ghar se skuti par kisi kaam par jane ke liye niklaa tha
 At the same time, the ambushed ambush surrounded Monu and fired indiscriminately at him
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki monu par bhi kai aapraadhik maamle darj hai or kuch hi din pehle jail se baahar aayaa tha
 Considering the manner in which this incident was carried out, there is a possibility of gang war
 pichley kuch dinon se bavana, narela, alipur, buraadi ilaakon main gangvaar kii badhati vaardaaton ko dekhakar is maamle ko bhi gangvaar se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 According to the family, this incident with Monu was carried out by some boys from the village due to mutual rivalry
 dopaher kareeb 11:30 baje jab monu apane ghar se khet ke liye niklaa tabhi hamalaavaron ne gher liya or goli chalaanaa shuru kar di
 When he entered a house to escape, the attackers entered the house and shot him
 monu par pehle bhi jaanaleva hamalaa ho chukaa he jisamen police ne maamla to darj kiya par maamle ko gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 In this attack, Monu received two bullets and was taken to the Maharishi Valmiki Hospital for treatment
 haalat bigadati dekh doctoron ne saroj aspataal main refer kar diya jahaan lagaataar monu kaa ilaaj jari he
 As of now, the police seems to be avoiding saying anything in this matter
 police ab is maamle kii jaanch main juty hui he
 This is not a mirror of ours
 darpan main visi sivi hi nazar aayega
 Then the VC would have thought
 bagair sivi ke visi bananaa to thik he lekin hamaari badshahath main unki sivi kisi hogi jinaki haisiyat visi se bhi zyaada he
 The bus summoned badshah-e-jnu
 pro romila thapar kii sivi mangai jaae
 The registrar also sent the royal decree
 kya pataa unke ahan ko chot pahunchi hogi ki pradhanmantri modi kii degree poochi gai
 Smriti Irani degree asked
 ab shiksha mantri ramesh pokharial ke dow
 Being disputed
 jawaab na dene ke baad bhi baar-baar poochne kaa dussahas kiya gaya
 It is given when there is a degree, when it is not there, where it should be given
 itani simpal baat agar koi nahin samajhataa he to unheen se unki sivi poochi jaae
 One evening, a VC immersed in these thoughts must have thought that let's ask the CV of those who asked
 yah shubh sanket he
 Creating curiosity about Romila Thapar's CV is a very auspicious sign
 lucks under garment kaa vigyaapan tha
 Idea comes when you are comfortable in life
 to idia aa gaya hoga
 Chala Guru, consults in a meeting
 phir romila thapar ko inslt karte hai
 They ask for their CV
 pataa to karen ki koi pro romila thapar kaise banataa he
 Writes how many books
 kitni kitaaben padhata he
 Discussion on this topic will also be good
 berojgaare, mandi, kashmir or assam sab thikaane lag jaaenge
 Googling the questioners
 kya media 5 pratishat jidipi kii sachai chipa rahaa he?mujhe visi par garv he ki unhone romila thapar ko bulaakar kore kaagaz par naam likh kar dikhaane ko nahin kaha
 a did not ask Apple and z did not ask Zebra
 o se aaul nahin poocha
 Rather it should also be asked
 main morrkhtaa ke is rashtriya utsav ko shandaar banane ke liye ye idia detaa hum
 Write a letter to Emperor AJNU and ask that Romila Thapar's primary school be found
 duniya main na hon to mantrocchar kara kar duniya main laayaa jaae
 Asked if Romila was in Thapar class or not
 ri se rishi bolti thim yaa nahin
 If she did not speak then it would be proved that she was an extreme leftist against the Indian tradition
 aarthik morche par lagaataar ludhakti sarkaar ko kyon chahie kashmir kashmiraje en you prashasan ke bheetar ke kamare main hansi gunj rahi hogi
 When the conscience ceases, such laughter ceases to be a support for living
 unhen ab koi shaam udhaas nahin karti hogi
 Just like a wooden machine, they are left as parts to be played
 ek uniwarsity ke barbaad hone kaa isse acha pramaan kya ho saktaa he
 This is good news for the youth of Hindi states
 kasbon kii barbaad uniwarsity se palaayan kar wo lambey samay se aisi bachi-khuchi uniwarsity main aate rahe hai
 Now all roads are closed for them
 ab ve apane ghar main aaraam kar sakate hai
 Another university was ruined
 main hindi pradesh ke yuvaaon ko badhai detaa hum
 They should eat sweets when JNU is ruined
 je en you ke khilaaf unki whats ap uniwarsity main dher saare messej pade honge
 They should all be read at the time of celebration
 naujavaanon kii siyaasi samaj third class ho chuki he
 They have become dead
 bas yah poochne bhar ke liye zindaa hai ki do saal pehle jo pariksha di thi uskaa riselt kab aayega
 Therefore, i can definitely say that the youth of the Hindi state sold in the name of the country will find goodness in this decision as well
 baaki kaam hindi media kar hi degaa
 The youth of the Hindi state have been living in detention centers being built in Assam since long
 unka bhavishya aise hi muddon se ban rahaa he
 Which is called ruining in Hindi
 raveesh kumaar kaa blog : ek majdoor kii jubaani, tamilnadu ke kapadaa mil kii kahaneromila thapar ko visi ko sivi bhejni chahie
 The names of his books will be printed again

 The youngster will re-read his magnificent book on Somnath
 maine uske kuch hisse apane blog kasbaa par likhe hai
 Also read Shankutla
 ashok or maury samrajya kaa patan to padhe hin
 However, now it will not be questioned in any examination
 wo sab intazaam ho chukaa he
 Also read The Public Intellectuals in India, The Past and Present
 isse angrezi behatar ho jaaegi
 Take good care of the fact that history is not better
 wo zaruri nahin he
 The worse it is, the more your progress in this period
 baaki yah soochna mahatvapurn nahin he ki pro romila thapar 1991 main ritair ho gai thim
 Professor Emiratus is a lawyer that the university offers
 iske liye koi paisa nahin miltaa he
 Romila Thapar's CV is also on the JNU website
 lekin maang dene se naujavaanon ko bhatakaane main madad milti he so mil gai
 CV is sought if the postal department is not closed in the era of Digital India
 daakiya ko kaam dena he
 CV of Romila Thapar is invited
 hindi media ke 'ditension centre' main band hai hindi pradeshon ke noujvaan, assam or kashmir par charchaa hi kahaan haromila thapar ko garv karnaa chahie
 After all, his university asked if Romila Thapar is wrong
 unhen visi ko sivi bhej deni chahie
 This will have two types of effects on VC people
 apni sivi main romila ke kitabon kaa naam daalkar apana bataane lagenge
 People in India become vcs by stealing theses
 unhen sivi churaane ke haq se vanchit karnaa vaisaa hi he jaise dakaiti par nazar nahin he, shahar main hangaamaa he ki kisi kii jeb se paanch rupee cat gaye
 One effect would also be that the vcs would be afraid that no one would ask for a CV
 agar hindi pradeshon main jaagrukta aa gai or log visi kii sivi poochne lagen to kya hoga
 Well, that awareness will never come
 uniwarsity ke barbaad hone kaa jitna saamaajik auki raajnneetik samarthan bharat main miltaa he,utana kahin nahin milegaa
 That is why we are making India a world guru without gurus
 romila thapar ko bharat ko vishwa guru banane ke project main sahyog karnaa chahie
 There is so much request that write a little English light in the CV or else they may be accused of neglecting Sanskrit
 or haa yah khabar nor rezitend indian tak na pahunche
 Her children are studying at the illustrious universities in America and Europe
 unhen shame aa sakati he
 Let foolishness prevail everywhere
 phir kahata hum
 CV should be sent to Professor Romila Thapar
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab 'man kii baat' kaarykram ke jariye niyamit rup se logon tak apni baat pahunchane kaa elaan kiya tha, tab yah ummid jaagi thi ki public ahm muddon par piem ke nazariye se waakif ho sakegi
 But now questions are being raised on this program
 kisi bhi pradhanmantri se janata yahi apeksha karti he ki vah bataae ki desh kis raste aage badhegaa or maujuuda samasyaon se nibatane ke liye sarkaar kya kadam uthaa rahi he
 The Prime Minister and his Cabinet are responsible for deciding such policies
 yahi vajah he ki public piem ko khub gaur se sunati he or maun rahane vaale piem ko 'mauni baba' kahkar kosti he
 When the public starts listening to 'mann Ki Baat', he is interested to know the opinion of the PM on current and burning issues
 lekin hota he iske ulat
 People are compelled to listen to what PM Modi is interested in telling
 jaahir he, kisi bhi piem kii dilchaspee apane kaamkaaj kaa bakhaan karne or'kathith kamyaabi' kaa dhindhora petenemen hi hoti he
 Modi seems to be avoiding speaking on issues on which he does not like to speak in terms of politics
 gujarat main aarakshan kii aag or hinsa se piem dukhi hai yaa ho sakate hai, yah andaja kise nahin tha? keval itnaa kehane se baat khatm! yah to bataaie ki aarakshan par sarkaar kii niti kya he? patel aarakshan ho jat aarakshan, aapkaa mat kya he? is tarah ke vivaadaaspad muddon par agar gujarat yaa desh ke kisi anya bhaag main bhavanaaen bhadakti hai or hinsa kii aag failati he, to sarkaar kya karegi? in saare sawaalon kaa jawaab kya maun hi he?deshbhar main fasalon ke nuksaan ke baad kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii ghatnaayen tham nahin rahi hai
 Not getting compensation or not getting fair compensation is a big problem
 iske nidaan ke liye kya thos kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 Can the answer be, 'jai Jawan, Jai Kisan is not a slogan for us, but a mantra
 '?ek-do nahin, aise dheron mudde bina khoje mil jaaenge, jis par piem modi ko bolnaa chahie
 According to the report, initially the letters sent for 'mann Ki Baat' are now sent only 15-20 per cent
 program kii lokapriyata main kis kadar giravat ai he, isse saaf jaahir ho jaataa he
 Huzoor, the head of the village is sufficient to give advice on light issues in his country

 It contains history

 To ensure the victory of 2019, the party is giving tickets to the candidates by electing them
 lekin isi vajah se bijepi ke diggaj hi party se khafa ho gaye hai
 It is being told that like LK Advani, the BJP has made up its mind not to give tickets to senior leader Murli Manohar Joshi
 jab party kii ore se sanghathan mahasachiv raamalaal ne unhen is baat kii jaankaree di to is par vah khafa ho gaye
 In fact, on Monday, BJP General Secretary Ramlal met senior BJP leader Murali Manohar Joshi
 raamalaal ne murali manohar joshi se kaha ki party ne dyside kiya he ki aapako chunaav nahin ladvaya jaae
 Ramlal said that the party wants you to come to the party office and declare not to contest
 haalanki, party kii is apil ko murali manohar joshi ne sidhe taur par nakaar diya
 Joshi said that these are not party rites, if we have decided not to contest elections, at least party president Amit Shah should come and inform us
 murali manohar joshi ne saaf kaha ki vah party daftar aakar isaki ghoshnaa nahin karenge
 Murali Manohar Joshi has also issued a letter to the voters of Kanpur, in which he has written that on behalf of party general secretary Ramlal, i have been asked not to contest from Kanpur or any other seat
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle bijepi diggaj laalkrishna adwani kaa gandhinagar se tikat katane par kaaphi bavaal hua tha
 BJP president Amit Shah is now contesting from Gandhinagar
 adwani kaa tikat katane par shatrughna sinha samet congress ke netaaon ne bhi sawaal khadey kiye the
 It is worth mentioning that earlier also Ramlal had met LK Advani, Kalraj Mishra and talked to Shanta Kumar, Karia Munda about the decision not to give him a ticket
 tab bhi raamalaal ne in netaaon ko suchit kiya tha ki vah apni ore se chunaav naa ladane kaa elaan karen
 But LK Advani too did not dress up like Murali Manohar Joshi
 sutron kii maane to adwani ne bhi murali manohar joshi kii tarah raamalaal se kaha tha ki party hamen chunaav main tikat nahin dena chaahati he to party adhyaksh amit shah ko khud aakar party ke faisle kii jaankaree deni chahie

 When Benazir Bhutto was the Prime Minister of Pakistan long before the summer of 1999, the Pak Army had planned a military operation like Kargil, but she was against the idea
 yah khulaasa ek purv rajanyik kii nai kitaab main kiya gaya he
 Rajiv Dogra, Consul General of India from 1992 to 94 in Mountbatten to Manmohan Takkarachi, has written about several controversial issues between the two countries in his book Where Borders Bleed: An Insiders Account of indo-pak Relations
 pustak main kareeb 70 saal ke vivaad ke aitihaasik, kootnithik or sainya drushtikonon ko samahit kiya gaya he jo vibhaajan ke ghatnakram par roshni daalati he, uske baad ke jhagadon ko darshaati he or lord mountbeton tathaa mohammad ali jinna se lekar atal bihari vaajapeyi or manmohan singh jaisi shakhsiyaton par bhi prakaash daalati he

 unhonebenzir bhuttoko ‘udaar mizaaj’ vaali mahila bataaya or likhaa he ki benazir kii pashchimi shiksha ne unhen bahari duniya ke saath unke rishte main or adhik sweekaarya banaaya
 Dia Halkadogra of the interview writes, 'it is true that she was influenced by a low-grade intelligence gossip
 lekin yah bhi sach he ki kuch maukon par vah sena ke khilaaf apane rakh par kaayam raheen
 Due to this, the Kargil conflict was averted at least once during his tenure

 Monday is considered to be the day of Lord Shiva
 aaj ke din bholenath kii puja kii jaati he
 He never disappoints his devotees
 aaie jaanate hai shiv se jude 5 pratik or unki mahima
 Rudraksh means - the axis of Rudra, it is believed that Rudraksha originated from the tears of Lord Shiva
 rudraksh ko pracheen kaal se aabhushan ke rup main,suraksha ke liye,grah shanti ke liye or aadhyatmik laabh ke liye prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In total, 17 types of Rudraksh are found mainly, but 12 Mukhi Rudraksha are especially used
 rudraksh kalai , kanth or hryday par dhaaran kiya ja saktaa he
 It would be best to hold it up to the throat area
 - kalai main baarah,kanth main chhattis or hryday par ek sau aath daano ko dhaaran karnaa chahie
 - You can also wear a grain, but this grain should be up to the heart and should be in red thread
 - rudraksh ko krishna paksh kii chaturdashi ko yaa kisi bhi somvaar ko dhaaran kar sakate hai
 Falgun Krishna Chaturdashi means Shivaratri, wearing Rudraksha is best
 - rudraksh dhaaran karne ke purv use shiv ji ko samarpit karnaa chahie tathaa usee maala yaa rudraksh par mantra jaap karnaa chahie- jo log bhi rudraksh dhaaran karte hai unhen satvik rahanaa chahie tathaa aacharan ko shuddh rakhana chahie anyathaa rudraksh laabhakaari nahin hoga
 Damru- Lord Shiva is the originator of dance and music
 - shiv ji ke damru main na keval saaton sur hai balki uske andar varnmaala bhi he
 - Playing Shiva's damru signifies bliss and mars
 - ve damru bajaakar bhi khush hote hai or damru sunakar bhi
 - If Shiva praises daily by playing Damru in the house, then there would never be any harm in the house
 trishul- duniya kii koi bhi shakti ho - daihik, daivik yaa bhautik , shiv ke trishul ke aage nahin tik sakati
 - The trident of Shiva punishes every person according to his karma

 - With the ashes of incense lights in the house, one can anoint Shiva
 - parantu mahilaon ko bhasma se abhishek nahin karnaa chahie

 On Saturday evening, Pooja Katyal went to the ATM of Tilak Nagar to withdraw money, Pooja had some difficulty in withdrawing money from the card, immediately a young man standing outside the ATM immediately entered and helped Pooja to withdraw the money
 us yuvak ne puja ko jitne paise chahie the wo unhen nikaal kar de diya
 But during this time he not only found out the PIN of the card but also gave Pooja another card instead of his card
 us vakt puja ko us nguvak par jaraa sa bhi shaq nahin hua, isliye wo sidhe ghar aa gayi
 But on Saturday night, Pooja's senses flew when the messages of withdrawing money started coming on her mobile and within 35 minutes the account had disappeared from the account
 puja jab takicard blockkarvaa paati tab tak unke account se ek lakh rupye nikal chuke the
 Troubled Pooja is going round the police and the bank but she is not getting any benefit from anywhere

 After the india-australia Test match in Pune in three days, the cricket fans are eyeing the pitch of m Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru
 bharat or australia ke bich doosraa test 4 march se yahaan khelnaa janaa he
 From the very beginning, the Bangalore pitch has been made keeping in mind the batsmen and something similar is being expected this time too
 bengalooru main donon tiimon ko kisi pich milegi, is par sab kayaas lagane main vyast hai
 Karnataka State Cricket Association (KCA) secretary Sudhakar Rao said that he has not received any advice from anyone regarding the pitch
 unke mutabik pich aisi hogi jis par balle or gend ke bich barabari kaa muqaabala ho sake
 'our aim is to be a sporting test match pitch
 ham chaahate hai ki match puure paanch din chale
 We do not want the match to end in two or three days
 'tippaniyan Rao said that he has not stopped pouring water on the pitch
 unhone kaha ki 'ham pich kii nami ko barqaraar rakhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 We have not stopped watering the pitch and water will be poured on the pitch one or two days before the match
 tab ham dekhenge ki pich kii kya sthiti he phir koi faisalaa liya jayega
 Australian coach Darren Lehman said after the win in Pune, "I hope to get a good pitch in Bengaluru but it is not in aap's hands
" pune jaisi pich hamen srilanka main bhi mili jahaan ham series 3-0 se haare
 In the end we have to do our best as we did in Pune
 ' Significantly, the news related to the Pune pitch is in the news right now
 media main ai kuch report main bisisiai ke ek adhikari par pich ko spinneron ke manamafik banavaane kii baat bhi saamne ai he
 Although the work of the BCCI is currently being looked after by the Committee of Administrators, but a board official said to make pitch curator Pandurang Salgavkar a turning track
 iske anusaar, salgaonkar ke saath-saath bisisiai curator dalajit singh or dhiraj prasanna ne bhi terning trek banane se manaa kar diya, jiske baad adhikari ne pune ke ground staff ko pich se ghaas hataane or pani nahin dene kaa aadesh diya
 These things have come to the media quoting the Pune groundman
 bisisiai kii ore se koi safaai nahin ai he lekin match khatm hone ke baad hi captain viraat kohli or coach anil kumble ne apni baat rakhte hue saafe kar diya tha ki pich ko apane mutabik banane ke liye ve kisi se baat nahin karte
 At the same time, curator Salgavkar made it clear a few days before the match that he knew to do his job and did not listen to anyone in terms of pitch
 vaise khabar ye bhi he ki jab se team india ne pune main abhyaas karnaa shuru kiya, tab se 23 farvari tak pich pani ke liye taras gai
 Apparently in view of this, the secretary of Karnataka State Cricket Association has not stopped giving water on the pitch
 raav ne kaha ki unhone pich par pani daalana band nahin kiya he
 He said that 'we are trying to keep the pitch moisture intact
 hamane pich par pani dena band nahin kiya he or match se ek-do din pehle tak pich par pani daalaa jayega
 Then we will see what the condition of the pitch is, then a decision will be taken
 ' australian coach darren lehaman pune main jeet ke baad kaha, 'mujhe ummid he bengaluru main acchhee pich milegi lekin ye aap ke haath main nahin he
 We also got a pitch like Pune in Sri Lanka where we lost the series 3–0
 ant main hamen apana behtareen pradarshan karnaa hota he jaisaa hamane pune main kiya
 ' gauratlab he ki pune kii pich se judi khabaren is samay surkhiyon main hai
 Some reports in the media have also revealed that a BCCI official has made the pitch desirable to the spinners
 haalanki bisisiai kaa kaam filhal cameti of administrator (committee of Administrators) dekh rahi he lekin pich curator pandurang salgaonkar ko terning trek banane ke liye board ke ek adhikari ne kaha
 Accordingly, Salgavkar as well as BCCI curators Daljit Singh and Dheeraj Prasanna also refused to construct the turning track, after which the officer ordered the ground staff of Pune to remove grass from the pitch and not provide water
 ye baaten pune ke groundman ke hawaale se media main ai hai
 There is no clarification from the BCCI, but only after the match was over, captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble made it clear that they do not talk to anyone to make the pitch as per their own
 vahiin curator salgaonkar ne match se kuch din pehle saafe kar diya tha ki ve apana kaam karnaa jaanate hai or pich ke maamle main kisi kii nahin sunate
 By the way, the news is that ever since Team India started practicing in Pune, the pitch has been longing for water till 23 February
 zaahir he isi baat ko dekhte hue karnataka rajya cricket sangh ke sachiv ne pich par pani dena band nahin kiya he
