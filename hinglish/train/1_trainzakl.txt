 a court in Patiala in Punjab on Wednesday acquitted Maoist leader Kobad Gandhi on charges of giving anti-national speech at Punjab University six years ago
 patiala main 27 sitambar se har roj sune ja rahe is cese main adishnal seshan jaj mohammad gulzaar ne ye faisla sunaaya
 There have been 15 cases of sedition against Kobad Gandhi across the country
 is cese main bari hone ke baad 66 varshiya gandhi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki unhone khud ko bhartiya communist party ke pratibandhit sanghathan se alag kar liya he
 The case was registered by the police station Sadarpatialaki on 23 January 2010 under sections 10, 13, 18, 20 Unlawful Activity Amandment Act 2008 and sections 419 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code
 isamen police ne daawa kiya tha kicobargandhi ne saal 2009 main punjabi uniwarsity main bhadakaau bhaashan diya tha
 Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, Minister of State for Food Processing in the Central Government, has apologized for the vulgar language used
 lekin kya yah sirf abhadra bhashaa kaa maamla he? In the Delhi speech in which he used this language, in the next breath, he was seen saying that one who does not consider himself a child of Rama is not entitled to live in this country
 yah vaktavy darasal hindutvvaadi raajnneeti ke us ugr ikharepan kaa aainaa he, jisamen na hindutv kii samaj dikhti he, na bhartiyata kii
 Because Sadhvi Jyoti has forgotten that what she considers Hindutva and what she calls a lifestyle under her politics, there are many sections within it, which probably have the same faith in others as Rama
 jab hindutvvaadi raajnneeti ram par atirikt jor detii he to vah ram ko bhi chota karti he or shaiva shakt buddha jain jaisi kai duusari paramparaon ke bheetar ek tarah kaa anmanaapan paidaa karti he
 Ram is also not one
 tulsi ke ram alag hai or kabir ke ram alag hai
 Kabir calls himself Lord of Ram
 gandhi ke ram bhi alag hai
 But bjp's Ram is different from all these Ramas
 ve atirikt aakraamak hai or unke bhakt unke liye krishna, shiv, durga, kaali sabko apdasth karne kii koshish karte dikhaai padate hai
 The beauty and power of Hindutva lies in this pluralistic tradition itself
 yah sagar itani sari buundon se bana he ki alag−alag kaalon main samskritiyon kii kai lehren ain or inke bheetar apni jagah banaati raheen
 Apparently, a lot of mud has also come into this tradition, which we can do away with our critical conscience
 lekin yah sundarataa or shakti sabase zyada inhen varshon main ksheen padi hai, jab sadhvi jyoti jaise bhakt ram or hindutv donon par adhikaar jamaane main leen rahe hai
 They also narrow Rama to one country or India
 sach yah he ki bharat ke baahar bhi bahut saare samaaj or desh aise hai jahaan ram kii smriti badi samaadrut he or jo khud ko ram kii parampara kaa hissaa maanate hai, apane−aap ko unki maanas santan ke rup main dekhte hai
 When eyes like Sadhvi Jyoti combine Rama and Bharat, making the condition of joining one to be in the other, then suddenly Rama also becomes small and so is the country
 kyonki yah desh bhi ek nahin bahut sari paramparaon se bana he
 It also has the memory of Vaishnavism, Shaiva, Shakta, Sanatani, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim, Zoroastrian, Christian and many other traditions
 ye paramparaayen aapas main takaraai bhi hai or ek−duusare kii takat bhi bani hai
 When all these traditions came together in the fight for independence, a huge India was formed which excluded the British from their unarmed faith
 is vishaal bharat ko jis sampradayikta ne todaa or baanta uske ek sire par agar muslim lig khadi he to duusare sire par sangh parivaar or usase jude duusare sanghathan jo raashtra ko dharm kii badi sankari paribhaasha main baandh dena chaahate hai
 How he also wants to use the liberal stories of Hindutva for his petty politics, this tells the statement of Giriraj Singh, another minister in the central government, in which he has described Modi as Ram and Kejriwal as Marich
 ye mantri apni bhashaa waapas le lenge, lekin kya apni maansikta bhi badalenge? The police arrested a smuggler, claiming to have foiled a conspiracy to buy fake currency in local markets during festive season
 uske kabje se ek lakh rupee se zyada ke nakli note baraamad kiye gayi
 Superintendent of Police Srinivas Verma said that the arrested accused have been identified as Shivendra Bhati alias Bunty
 use police kii aparaadh shakha ne mubir kii soochna par elayeeji chauraahaa kshetra main jaal bichhaakar pakadaa
 Varma said that fake Indian currency worth one lakh five thousand rupees was recovered from Bhati's possession, which is in the form of one thousand and hundred rupee notes
 unhone bataaya ki police kii muhim ke dauraan bhaati kaa saathi naresh panvar maukey se faraar ho gaya, jisaki talash kii ja rahi he
 According to Verma, Panwar was arrested in 2005 in a fake note case and after getting out of jail, he again got into this illegal business
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki police ko andeh he ki nakli note prakaran ke donon aropiyon ke taar kisi bade antarraji giroh se jude hai
 He said that during initial interrogation of Bhati, it was found that this gang brings fake notes from Maharashtra and has so far sold fake Indian currency worth 2
5 lakh rupees in the markets
 is baat kii pushti karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he

 us din film or tivi institute main maine khud ko vah tamaam chijen karte paaya, jo main aam taur par is tarah kii jagahon par karata aayaa hum: un nai filmon kaa pataa lagaana jinhen chaatro ne haal hi main kahin se 'downlod' kiya he yaa phir copy kiya he
 Obviously, whatever movies i have in return, i will give them
 is baar mere collection main lagbhag 40 jibi kii japani filmein aa gayi, jinamein sarvaadhik vivaadit japani filmkaar sion sono kii suicide sarkal siries thi
 In return, i gave important films by China's sixth-generation filmmaker Wang Xiaoshui, including his recent popular films Frozen and So Close to Paradise (also known as Girl from Vietnam)
 bharat main wang kaa aadhikarik rup se pravesh pichley saal november main kolkata international film festival se hua tha, jisamen unki film ilevan flowers ko enitipiasi aword se nawaja gaya
 However, Wang had long since gained a reputation among young filmmakers and cinema lovers for his 2001 classic film Beijing Bicycle

 This fame was a result of the enthusiasm of students involved in film courses and the urge to find new masters for themselves
 unhone na sirf inhen khoja balki aapas main saz bhi kiya
 On many occasions, cinema lovers have formally saved, fiercely shared Wang Xiaoshui's films, and responded to their media online

 And with this, a new eco-system is developing
 yah tarksangat he ki ab film dikhaane ke nae thikaane taiyaar ho rahe hai, jinamein art gailaree se lekar cafe jaise anginat anaupchaarik thikaane shaamil hai, inhen main curation, parformens or agsibishan ke nae circuit kahata

 Anyone can become a fan of films The most well-known face of new cinema for most people is filmmaker and producer Anurag Kashyap
 anuraag bangla main kyuu kii film tasher desh, marathi filmkaar sachin kundalakar kii ayya or bedabrat pine kii chatgaanv ko bhi produs kar chuke hai
 He would also produce Kaul's next film but that could not happen due to Kaul's demise
 isliye ab ve kaul par ek dacumentary produs kar rahe hai
 To many, Anurag's use of this new space may seem opportunistic
 haalanki madad ke liye unka logon (masalan vikramaditya motwani) or vibhinn bhashaaon or sandarbhon kii filmon kaa chayan yah bataata he ki kaise puraani style ke film production ko nae dhang ke curation se joda ja saktaa he
 Directors like Sudhir Mishra, Kundan Shah, Jahnu Barua and Rituparno Ghosh, Anurag's film Mumbai Cutting with eleven short stories is the same as a hard disk for a film student
 tamaam tarah kii filmon ko doston or online anjaan cinema premiyon ke saath saajha karnaa or kai baar ise film nirmaan kii practice main tabdeel karnaa shaamil rahata he
 For us both styles are frozen and by looking back we can guess what kind of films and film history can be made
 ekadam saaf rujhaan dekhne ko mil rahaa he—pehla, filmein dekhi or jutakar rakhi jaati hai
 It does not appear that Indian cinema needs an archive for the next hundred years
 film ke kisi bhi chaatr kii 1 tibi kii discs yah kaam bakhubi kar sakati he
 Defining the kind of filmmaking that comes out of all this is a difficult task, but there are enough clues to understand what is going on
 yahaan kuch suzav pesh kiye ja rahe hai
 The emphasis on bitter reality is indeed in vogue: Vasepur has made its debut in a large number of films of today
 isse pehle ke daur main 1980 or 90 ke dashak ke mumbai ke gangstaron kii filmein hi bana karti thim
 Can say that this is the mark-to-reality
 isane aazaadee ke baad kii tamaam cinemai yatharthwaad ko badal daalaa he
 See, for example, that it has bridged the difference between the other realism shown as the difference between village and city
 kashyap kii vasepur in donon ke bich main he, ek aisi jagah jo kabhi mumbai or bihar ke bichobich hua karti thi
 Such realism relies on an entirely new soundscape: sync sound is seen on one level, but on another the sound is used in such a way that one can find it today in Sneha Khanwilkar's soundtrapping
 ise lokation sound or usase thodi chhedchhad ke saath taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 That is, a special kind of music that is threaded according to the occasion
 pehle hamane aisa kabhi nahin dekha?aap aaj kii film nirmaan kii style ko tab tak nahin samajha sakate, jab tak gujarey jamaane kii style ko na samajhengen: film kii sari jabaanen ghani ho rahi hai
 That is, such a deep idiom of conversation that cannot be easily defined
 sabase pehle ek shabdkosh lekar baithna hoga, jisase aap ek shatabdi puraani filmon ke taur-tareeke jaan saken
 Then it is the era of remakes: the era of Sahab, Bibi and Gangster, the era of Bollywood that is not easy to understand
 masalan—om shanti om, basharte aap sattar ke dashak kii filmon ko jaanate hon
 The most interesting for me is the introduction of cinema in new forms
 meraa sabase taaja anubhav he srujit mukherjee kii 2010 kii bengali film autograph
 It stars actor Prasenjit as the superstar, starring Satyajit Ray in the fictional remake Nayak and starring actor Uttam Kumar
 film hi nahin, bahut kuchhkadave yatharth par aadhaarit filmon main ek teesraa rujhaan charitron kii banaavat he
 i think exchanged cinema is moving forward and is trying to turn into dialogue
 is tarah hamaare paas charitron kii lambii qatari he or ek charitra se duusare par jane kii aazaadee
 This is how cinema is growing
 sabase dilachasp yahi rujhaan he kyonki hamen lagata he ki apni kahani kahana behad jaruri he
 But the Indian economy does not promote it commercially: Ra for Sony Play Station-3
 van game kii asafalataa isi kii misaal he
 What is needed is Rajinikanth's film Robo or Shah Rukh Khan's aspirations to be a superhero that goes beyond cinema - that is, to take the cinema viewer into the glass cage in which the hero is trapped
 isliye aisi pahal kiijie jo in sitaron se bhi badi ho
 This is an effort, which is taking Indian cinema in such an era, for which neither the market is ready nor the technology
 yah sab us bhartiya cinema ke liye nayaa nahin he, jo hameshaa bina kisi market saport ke apana kaam karata aayaa he
 
 
 The only difference is that viewers are connecting more to the cinema through the new hard disk

 The MP alleged that the officer abused him in front of 150 of his supporters and also threatened to kill him
 police kahati he ki aisa mumkin nahin he ki koi saansad ke saikadon samarthakon ke saamne use gaaliyaan de
 Savitri Bai Phule is extremely angry with the highwaymen
 unka kahana he ki unki jaanch se naaraaz project manager ne unhen gaaliyaan deen
 He told me, he also misbehaved with me, used inaccuracies, abused caste indicators
 ' When MP Sahiba was asked again what had happened, she had probably forgotten her first statement, so this time she said that she did not have the capacity to abuse him
 dobaaraa poochne par unhone kaha, apshabdon kaa hi prayog kiya, gaali dene kii to uski himmat nahin he
 ' upi main barabanki se baharich ke nepal border tak 150 kilometre lanbaa neshnal haive ban rahaa he
 50 km of it is being built by a big company in Bhopal

 His work is very good but he is unfortunate that 3 km of his road falls in the area of MP Savitri Bai Phule
 company ke project manager ne police main report kii he, 'saansad kamishan maangati hai, kahati hai ki hamaare ilaake main itnaa bada kaam kar rahe ho lekin hamase milte nahin, hamen dak bangale bulaakaar khaanaa khilaane kaha

 phir saansad ne jaanch ke naam par sadak ke bich main gaddha khudva diya
 i said that the road will be bad, dig the shore

 We are working in our area and we are mps, you do not know we can uproot your road
 ' On the complaint of the MP, an FIR has been written against the project manager
 lekin police ko saansad kii baat par yakeen nahin he
 The comments baharich ke cirkil officer anup kumaar ne bataaya, 'maine unase kaha tha ki sahi tathyon ke aadhaar par abhiyog darj karaaen kyonki ek mananeey saansad or itane samarthakon ke saaman ye ghatana sambhav nahin he
 Such incidents shatter the morale of the well-to-do and also damage the image of the MP and his party
 savitri bai phule haive banane waalon se beintahaa naaraaz hai
 He says that he was abused by the project manager, angry with his investigation
 unhone bataaya, mere saath badasluki bhi kii, apshabdon kaa prayog bhi kiya, jati suchak gaali bhi diya
 ' saansad sahiba se jab dobaaraa poocha gaya ki kya hua tha, tab tak vah apana pehla bayaan shaayad bhul chukin thim, isliye is baar kaha ki uski himmat nahin he ki unhen gaali de

 yah sach he ki kuch bade daanvpech chalate rahete hai-2008 ke hamale ke masale ko kisi tarah se khatm karne kii nirantar maang, saudi arab main jabiuddin ansaari kii giraftaar, kabhi rukati, kabhi shuru hoti shanti prakriya kyonki sabhi ko afghanistan ke sthir hone kaa intjaar he-or der-saber ye maamle har channel or akhbaar ke madhyam se puure desh main chaa jaaenge or nafrat ek baar phir sexi ho jaaegi
 Whenever the next serious confrontation unfolds — and it will come — well-known anchors will be seen on TV screaming and waving hands, demanding harsh answers, the Internet will be filled with hatred, the government will also be bogged down, and More impotent temper, and more international hollow lamentation, a hapless celebration of the jijeevishha of the city of the recent attack, and more mass prayers that India remains restrained and emphatic That bit of violence does not become a victim of Jison
 deshbhakti ke naam par pehle se zyada seenaa thoka jayega, bina jawaab vaale or adhik sawaal, suraksha agenciyon par milakar kaam karne ke liye pehle se zyada dabaav
 And then there are some of us who will again get busy in our daily lives
 yah ek rata-rataya dharra he jisase ham acchhee tarah se waakif hai, ek chakra he, jisase ham taumr parichit rahe hai
 Today most people working in the media have grown up in this environment and their experiences give shape to these news
 ve badal chuke hai isliye khabaren bhi badal chuki heshassi ke dashak main paidaa hui peedi ke liye pakistan sudur pashchim main sthit ek buree najar vaala haasyaaspad dushman tha or jahaan rahane vaala har shaks javed miyandad tha
 However, the US liked him for some reason, and in fact for many of us, this was an early indication that what we know about Pakistan is much more than that
 yah kaise hua ki mithun chakravarti, maadhuri dikshit or kapil dev kaa desh bharat kathaon, jo puri tarah bhala or har tarah se paripurna tha, rambo aar mistar tii vaale desh kii bajaae vigyaan kii gambhir kitabon, vigyaan or spescraft vaale soviet desh uasasar kaa behatar mitra tha? kya duniya jaisaa ham sochate the, us tarah doharepan kaa shikaar nahin he?bhartiya media ne bhi hamaare saath hi apni kishoravastha main pravesh kiya tha or achaanak hi duniya kuch zyada hi jatil ho gai
 Those who were from across the border became people, they were not just victims of Sunny Deol's hand pump violence
 kargil hua or hamane jashn nahin manaaya, log maare gaye or kisi kii bhi jeet nahin hui
 And the feeling started coming home that this conflict which had started even before we were born was not going to end in our life
 sarkarein ain or gayi, donon deshon ne pidaa jheli or donon desh aage bad gaye
 Our media has changed at a tremendous speed
 achaanak hi patrkaar ab ruukhe aankade dene vaala, sakht chhavi vaala visheshgy nahin rah gaya he
 He also became a human being — a man we know, people we accept, men we hate or love, celebrities, thinkers, sex symbols, the world began to look more open in the havoc of the new economy
 hamaari aawaaj tej ho gai, hamaari ridh tan gai or hamaari chamadi moti ho gai
 We also became complacent and learned to criticize ourselves
 nai awaajen, nai bhashaaen, nae vichaar mukhyadhara main aane lageh hamaari pasand kaa nirdhaaran koi doosraa nahin kar rahaa tha or ham aage badhate hue khud faisla kar rahe the ki ham khud ke liye kya pasand karte hai
 We had given up trying to define India and we started making expectations from India
 ham paripakv ho gaye
 And it has always been a disappointing thing
 bhartiya media kaa mukhya uddeshy use khud ko bhartiya kanjumar ko bechnaa he
 When the Pakistani media described the Indian media as ultra-nationalist, flattering and false to the government, as the Indian media did after the 2008 attack, it missed a point
 bhartiya media bharat sarkaar kaa aujaar nahin he
 It is a group of few people who want to run their livelihood
 or yadi nafrat bikati he to ve nafrat hi bechenge
 But in the peacetime, the provocative rock band and fast bowler will be news for him
 bharatiyon ke bich bharat kii kahani hi bikati he
 And right now we are surrounded by our problems
 ham antarrashtriya str par gussa jaahir karte hai or ekmaatr cheez jo badalati he vah he pratidin kaa vishay
 The Indian media is undoubtedly the biggest player on this map
 ham bharat manthan ke jariye bharat adhyayan se aage bad gaye hai or bharat udai se chitkaar karte bharat kii taraf bad gaye
 As far as i remember, Indian media has reached its lowest level of credibility in the midst of a dreaded mob attack on a single girl from Radiagat in Assam
 isi ke saath ham aisi patrakarita bhi dekh rahe hai jo apni purvavarti patrakarita se kaaphi oonche str kii he
 As the worst stereotype about India says, we are masters of Indian duplicity
 yah dekhnaa aasaan he ki bhartiya media vishwasaneeyata ke sankat se kyon guzar rahaa he
 The first question is of quality
 isaki aniyamitataayen chakit kar dene vaali hai
 After every good news comes a news that is a bad example of dull journalism
 sabase bura he ped news kaa khulaa chalan
 An Indian concept in which shameless Indian media institutions sell their services to corporates
 or isane sirf un logon par daag nahin lagaaya jo ped news chalaate hai balki samoochaa bhartiya media isse daagdar ho gaya he
 This is not the time to defend yourself by saying how all this is also prevalent in the West
 lekin, yadi ham pashchim kii taraf dekhte hai to vahaan ke tabloid bhi apane akhabaaron ke maanak staron main saamanjasy banaae rakhte hai
 Reconciliation, logic, discretion and pleading: These are some of the things that the Indian media desperately need
 or ise hasil karne ke liye khud ke andar jhankane kii jarurat padegi
 At a time when marketing and ad sales keep constant pressure on editors and poor journalism attracts more people, it is difficult to see its flaws
 lekin yahi vah daur bhi he jab har koi broadcaster he or koi sunanaa nahin chahta
 An era when readers and listeners have choice and power
 aise main acchhee patrakarita kii buniyaad or usulon kii taraf lautnaa hi is digital yug main kisi media santhaan ko bachaa saktaa he
 The media urgently needs to wake up to this matter or else the story of our country will become even darker

 Navjot Singh Sidhu, a minister and former cricketer in the Punjab government, is once again in controversy
 haal hi main unke tivi sho main shaamil hone ke mudde par vivaad jari tha, is bich inakam tex kaa maamla bhi saamne aayaa he
 It is reported that the Income Tax Department has seized two of his accounts
 aarope he ki siddhu ne kai chizon main puraa tex adaa nahin kiya he
 In this, the bills of expenses shown by Sidhu in 2014-15 returns were not presented
 sutron ke mutabik ritern main siddhu ne kapadon par 28 lakh, yatra par 38 lakh se zyada, ful par kareeb 18 lakh, staff kii selary par 47 lakh se zyada kaa kharch dikhaaya he

 Now the Income Tax department asked Sidhu to either present the bill or pay tax
 ise lekar vibhaag kii taraf se siddhu ko 3 notice bhi jari kiye gaye
 After this, on February 14, the department seized two accounts of Sidhu and recovered Rs 58 lakh
 haalanki siddhu kaa daawa ye ki un par koi dendaree bakaayaa nahin he
 Whether it is a cricket ground, a TV screen or a political pitch, Navjot Singh Sidhu always plays on the front foot
 apane bebaak andaaz se saamne vaale kii bolti band karne kaa hunar wo bakhubi jaanate hai lekin is baar siddhu khud gugali main ulajhate dikh rahe hai

 ) raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne apni nai kitaab 'the Turbulent Years 1980-1996' main sanjay gandhi ke bare main jo kaha he, usase nayaa vivaad khadaa ho saktaa he
 Pranab Mukherjee has not only praised Sanjay Gandhi strongly in his book but has also counted family planning which was highly controversial during his time
 babari masjid ko giraae jane ko ek behad sharmnaak ghatana bataate hue pranab ne likhaa he ki ye ek aisi ghatana thi jisase duniya main ek sahishnu or dharmik sadbhaav vaale desh ke rup main bharat kii chhavi ko dhakka laga

 Narasimha Rao kept listening quietly in his familiar style
 lekin unke chehre ko dekh kar lag rahaa tha ki vah dukhi or niraash hai
 'did not see the dream of becoming PM,' Mukherjee admitted that it was his mistake to form a separate party after he was expelled from the Congress in 1986

 With the arrival of many accused in Tihar Jail, the smell of South Indian cuisine has started coming from the jail kitchen
 jail ke kaidiyon ko dakshin bhartiya vyanjan pakaane kaa vishesh prashikshan diya gaya he
 The canteen of Jail numbers one, four and six in Tihar are now serving North Indian and South Indian dishes including dosa, uttapam, idli, sambar, and coconut chutney
 jail ke sutron ne bataaya ki jail sankhya ek ke canteen ke menu main pehali baar dakshin bhartiya vyanjan tab najar aae jab farvari main purv doorsanchaar mantri tathaa dramuk netaa e raja ko tu ji spectrum aavanton ghotaale main kathith bhoomika ke silsile main yahaan band kiya gaya
 In the past, this canteen of prisoners used to serve Chole Bhature, Puri vegetable, Namkeen, Samosa, Sandwiches and Tea

 Sources said that when Kanimozhi, the daughter of DMK chief Karunanidhi, was named in the 2G spectrum scam, women inmates of jail number six were immediately taught how to cook South Indian dishes
 jail sankhya chaar main bhi yahi hua jahaan kalenganor tivi ke prabandh nideshak sharad kumaar band hai

 sutron ne yah bhi bataaya ki teenon jelon ke canteen main pak rahe dakshin bhartiya vyanjanon ko anya kaidi bhi pasand kar rahe hai
 Inmates are given Rs 1,000 on arrival in jail and this amount is sufficient to collect coupons for the purpose of purchasing food items from the canteen

 In the BCCI Women's Under-19 ODI League, so many extra runs were given by a team, which led to their defeat
 yah muqabla manipur or nagaland ke bich khelaa ja rahaa tha, jisamen nagaland kii team ne manipur ko 117 ranon se shikast di thi
 Interestingly, 112 out of 117 runs were given to Nagaland as extras by the Manipur team

 But out of these 215 runs, Nagaland had scored only 103 runs

 This 112 extra runs proved to be a bonus for Nagaland
 manipur kii gendbaajon ne 15 no ball, 94 wide, 2 bai or 2 leg bai ke taur par 112 extra ran die
 Let us tell you that only two batsmen from Nagaland were able to cross double digits and the entire team scored just 103 runs without any extra runs
 lekin manipur ne unhen 112 ran tohfe ke rup main de die or nagaland kaa score 215 ran tak ja pahunchaa, jo unki haar kaa kaaran bana
 Manipur's team, chasing Nagaland's target of 216 runs, collapsed for only 98 runs and lost the match by 117 runs
 jo unke die extra ranon se sirf 5 ran hi zyada the
 It was an embarrassing performance in which his bowlers contributed 100 percent to a team's defeat
 manipur ko is baat kaa afsos hogi ki unke die extra ran unki haar kaa kaaran bane the

 The Supreme Court asked the Delhi government to send an officer in the court who knows something and share all the information of the previous meeting with the court

 Vaidya's remarks came in the wake of the three-day All India Executive Board of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh which was inaugurated by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat
 thane ke bhayandar main RSS or iske anushangik sanghathanon ke pramukh isamen hissaa le rahe hai
 Vaidya said that the issue is of national and social importance, which should be discussed during the conference

 On this occasion, BHU Vice Chancellor Girish Chandra Tripathi said, "demonstrations spread due to rumors and outsiders were involved
 hamen sansthaanon kii garima kaa bhi sammaan karnaa hoga
 i am confident that the institution is capable of resolving this issue
 is ghatana se prashasan bhi niraash hua he
 We are ready to welcome any suggestions to improve the situation and prevent such incidents in future
 "aaj tak ke saath hui khaas baatcheet membenaras hindu vishvavidhyalay ke kulapatine kaha, "biechayu main sabase pehle hamane campus main 65 sensotive jagah ko chinhit kiya
 CCTV was to be installed there
 jab sisitivi lagaana shuru kiya gaya to kuch student ne privesi (niztaa) ko lekar sisitivi kaa virodh kiya
 When it came to installing wi-fi, we were the first to attend a women's college
 "vishvavidhyalay main kathith langik pakshpaat par biechayu ke kulapati ne kaha ki kya yah galat he ki ham apane ladakon kii tulana main apni ladakiyon kii suraksha ko lekar zyada chintit hai
 He also said that this is happening everywhere but BHU gets highlighted
 unhone kaha, "baat discrimination kii ho rahi he to ham kehete hai ki hamaare liye donon samaan nahin
 
 
 Women are older than men
 ye desh kii samskruti he
 radha-krishna, sita-rama are taken first
 "hostel main karfu timepar apni baat rakhte hue visi ne kaha, "aap kehete hai ki raat aath baje ke baad koi nahin nikalataa he
 We tell you that girls play from 8 to 9 o'clock where the case happened
 vahaan aaj tak koi pareshaan nahin hua he
 It is also wrong to say that after eight o'clock in the night we do not allow the girl students to go out
 ladkiyaan 8 baje hostel main aa jaaen, is baat par zyaadaatar abhibhavakon ne sahmati jataai
 Only a few percent of girls refuse
 ladakiyon kii suraksha zyada badi jimmedaari he
 We are more concerned about their safety
 kya ye galat he
 So we set the timing of 8 and 10
 "unhone aage kaha ki campus main chaatr-chaatraon ke alaava shahar ke log, aspataal ke log, mandir ke log bhi aate hai
 Millions of people come, but for us, student safety is more important
 campus main surakshapar bolte hue unhone kaha, "hamaare biechayu main security guard lagane kaa ye niyam he ki sena kaa purv sainik hona chahie par hamen mahilaayein nahin milteen
 Now we are talking about making our own girls as guards
 padhai ke saath unki kamai bhi hogi isliye humlog apni hi ladakiyon ko guard banane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 "girls go out after 8 o'clock after talking to the warden
 During the conversation, the VC said," For us the safety of girls is a much greater responsibility, so girls should come to the hostel by 8 pm
 ye niyam pehle se chalaa aa rahaa he
 But some girls have to leave at eight o'clock, so they go to their warden
 "peedit chaatra se mulaakaat ko lekar unhone kaha, "ye galat he ki main chaatra se nahin mila hum
 i have met that student, i have also met her family
 uski saheliyon se bhi mila hum
 Some conspiracy behind the incident said, "I think there is a conspiracy behind this
 isko jaanboojhkar rajnetik rang dene diya gaya he
 There is a conspiracy in this because the Prime Minister had to go from the place where the protest took place
 "unhone aage kamishnar kii report ke bare main baat karte hue kaha, "police kamishnar kii report kii maine dekhi nahin hai isliye is par mujhe kuch nahin kahana he
 i was in constant conversation with the Police Commissioner and DM while this incident was going on
 sisitivi footage ko khangala ja rahaa he
 The photo of those suspected is being shown to the student
 jo bhi doshi hai unhen sajaa jarur milegi
 Whoever is guilty will not be spared
 campus main baahar ke log nahin aaen iske liye ham jila prashasan se baat kar rahe hai
 "nobody asked to go on leave," the VC said, "I have been talking to HRD minister Prakash Jawadekar on the subject since the beginning of the event
 maine unhen maamle par ek report bhi di he
 No one has asked me to go on vacation, it would be enough for me

 On the night of May 17, two hours after the killing of the driver of Iqbal Kaskar, brother of Dawood Ibrahim, India's most wanted terrorist, Mafia gangster, the Mumbai police stationed two of his soldiers at the door of his house in Bhendi Bazaar in Mumbai
 kareeb ek dashak se daaud ke bahudhandhi vyavsaayik samrajya kaa sanchaalan kar rahe kaskar kii hifaazat ke liye vaise bhi itane aadmi tainaat hai jitne kisi mafia don ke liye tainaat ho sakate hai
 His personal bodyguards carry unlicensed Smith and Wesson pistols
 lekin driver aarif saiyad kii hatya se puraa mafia tantra hi nahin, police bhi sann he
 No one had dared to attack Dawood's headquarters in an ordinary building on Pakmodia Street
 yah dussahasik hatya pratidwandvi giroh kii ore se bheja gaya sanket he ki bahucharchit daaud kunba or 'sher kii maand' ke naam se kukhyat uskaa adda ab uski goliyon kii jad se pare nahin rah gaya he
 As is well known, Dawood himself lives under the protection of Pakistani authorities in Karachi
 jin sipaahiyon ko hamane apni padtaal ke dauraan or kaskar ke yahaan tainaat dekha or jo yah report likhane tak vahaan tainaat the unhen mumbai police ne vahaan kyon bheja tha? ve kaskar ko giraftaar karne nahin gaye the, jiskaa naam sabase vaanchit aparaadhiyon kii kisi bhi police suchi main sabase upar hona chahie
 One opinion is that the police are more interested in protecting him than imprisoning him
 aakhir mafia kaali kamai kaa aakshok strot jo he
 Additional police commissioner (crime branch) Deven Bharti says these soldiers are only deployed to "keep a watchful eye"
 police ne driver kii hatya ke aarope main 29 varshiya bilal saiyad or 28 varshiya indralal khatri ko giraftaar karne main jarur furti dikhaai he
 This must have brought relief to the Dawood gang and it would have felt that he also had some friends in the Indian government
 kaskar ko 2003 main dubai se girohabaaj ejaj pathan ke saath bharat bhej diya gaya tha
 Dawood, who has been under heavy pressure since the killing of Osama bin Laden, heard of this latest Mumbai murder case when he was preparing to marry his son Moin in Nairobi
 vah karachi main ruk gaya or usne apni bivi 48 varshiya meh
 Jabi was dispatched to arrange the ceremony
 usne navvivaahit jode ko aashirwad dene ke liye prastaavit video conference ko bhi radd kar diya
 Officials of the Mumbai Crime Branch say that a heart patient Dawood has asked his aide Chhota Shakeel to avenge the May 17 incident
 asipi bharti kaa kahana he, ''hamen mumbai main jaldi hi kuch javaabi hamale kii ashanka he
 Shakeel told Dubai news channel Aaj Tak that he was confident that Ubed, a friend of Dawood's arch-enemy Chhota Rajan, killed Kaskar's driver as part of a broader conspiracy to wipe out those close to Don

 It has selected four African countries as its potential base - Somalia, Zimbabwe, Congo and Sudan
 khufia beuro (ibi) ke adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki daaud africa main bade paimaane par jameen kharidne kii koshish kar rahaa he taaki baad main use krishi utpaadan ke liye patte par diya ja sake
 "his henchmen are in touch with the tribal chieftains," says an IB official
 ''jaahir he, daaud ke pratidwandvi ise us shaks kii kamajori maan rahe hai jise kabhi is upmahadweep ke anderworld kaa ''tarkash'' mana jaataa tha

 Dawood wants to tie-up with Maoists in mineral-rich states like Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh in India to provide Rs 400 crore to the country's coal sector

 Home Secretary ke
 Pillai told India Today, "last year, he gave a henchman of Chhattisgarh Rs 25 lakh
 die lekin usne use thag liya
 Now he is trying to use Nepal's Maoists to contact his allies in India and is giving them shells and weapons
 vah kuch khaanon par kabja karnaa chahta he
 '' Apart from that coal 2

 Batki runs a business of fake notes from Dubai to India

 He began to use the border of Nepal and Bangladesh as vigilance increased at Indian ports

 M
 abdulla kii kerala main giraftaar ke baad nae saajheedaaron kii talash shuru kar di he
 Rajkumar Wahtkar, deputy commissioner of Mumbai Police (operations), said, "nepal has been the hub of its trade of fake notes for more than a decade
 '' daaud nepal sarkaar ke maun samarthan se hathiyaar or nakli note pakistan se puure bharat main bhejtaa he
 Two years ago, with the help of Maoists, he created two arms manufacturing units in western Nepal
 nepal main uskaa doosraa dhandha vahaan ke share bazaar main chalata he
 Nepal's Home Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara, along with his cabinet colleagues, tried unsuccessfully to take up the matter
 unhone share bazaar or nepal ke kuch sthaneey bainkon main daaud ke benami niveshon kaa byora diya tha
 Prakash Dahal, the 29-year-old son of Maoist chief Pushp Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda and senior leader Sarina Begum, opposed Mahara's allegations
 bataaya jaataa he ki sarina begum pakistani cricketer javed miyandad ke bete ke saath daaud kii beti kii shaadi main maujuud thim
 In Dubai, the IB people traced the sending of Nepalese jewelery from Begum to Dawood's daughter through her friends in India
 bhartiya khufia adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki dahal ne dubai main daaud ke logon se mulaakaat kii thi
 Dahl has been under criticism for some time due to his contacts with the underworld
 nepal ke purv rajkumaar paras ke bhi daaud ke saath vyavsaayik sambandh hai
 He helped Dawood run more than 1,000 dance bars in the Thamel and Sondhara Hetras of Casinos and Kathmandu in Kathmandu and Pokhara
 pichley saal daaud ne sile-silaae vastron ke kaarobaar main kadam rakhaa
 He set up a factory on the outskirts of Shanghai and paid Rs 2,000 crore in India via Nepal's border towns Nepalganj and Biratnagar

 "dawood has always been associated with illegal things," says Doval
 lekin vah kai tarah ke vaid kaarobaar main bhi kadam rakh rahaa he
 "his name is recorded in the Mumbai police records as a 'fugitive accused' and he is accused of conspiring with the serial bomb blasts in Mumbai in 1993 along with his brother Anees Ibrahim
" vah bharat main pramukh realtaron ke saath sambandh banane kii puri koshish kar rahaa he
 The Mumbai Police claims that some of them are in touch with Realtor Dawn and demanded money from him to develop real estate in Maharashtra
 dibi realty ke ek maalik vivek goyanka, jo 2ji spectrum ghotaale main abhiyukt ke taur par jail main he, ke anderworld ke saath sambandhon kii jaanch kii gai thi
 Gandhi was arrested in 2007 after Iqbal Attarwala, an associate of Dawood, named Mumbai-based builder Umesh Gandhi in a land grab case in Malad

 Ballia has an assembly constituency where BJP and Congress candidates are not in the fray for the first time
 haalanki ye seat kabhi congress kaa garh rahi he
 But he is not present in this election
 isaki vajah wo gathbandhan he jisamen bhaajapa kii seat rajbharon kii party bhartiya samaaj party ke khate main chali gai
 Whereas in the account of SP, the Congress seat
 is seat par 2012 ke chunaav main duusare sthaan par rahi bhaajapa kii pratyaashee nirdaleey hi maidan main kud padi lihaaja muqabla dilachasp ho gaya he
 While taking stock of a village in Bansdih assembly constituency of Ballia, some people were seen watching the film on the screen in a big car
 najadik jane par pataa chalaa ki sapa ke prachaar vaahan se akhilesh kaa kaam bolta he kii film gramin dekh rahe hai
 This is a good way of campaigning in the dark of night, through which SP is making its presence felt
 par din ke ujaale main yahaan charchaa bhaajapa kii ho rahi he jabaki bhaajapa kaa koi pratyaashee bhi maidan main nahin he
 But to fit the caste equation of Purvanchal's caste equation, the BJP aligned with the Bhaspa, the regional party of the Rajbhars, and their candidates contested for the first time in the Bansdih assembly constituency
 bhaasapa ke pratyaashee is ilaake ke nahin hai or wo pehali baar chunaav maidan main bhi hai
 Because of which a challenge of identity is exposed
 par wo kehete hai kii janata unhen jitaayegi
 But this path is not so easy for the BJP alliance because here in 2012 BJP candidate Ketki Singh was a strong contender for the party ticket
 seat gathbandhan main bhaasapa ke khate main jane ke baad wo nirdaleey pratyaashee ke rup main chunaav maidan main hai
 She is also seen as a tough challenger as she has contested elections twice from this area, knowing the village while the candidates of the Bhaspa are not from this region
 unke virdohi isi ko mudda bhi bana rahe hai
 Independent candidate Ketki Singh says, "they are from outside, the public has shown them the way out, they will go out after the election
" tippaniyan Significantly, Bansdih assembly constituency once dominated the Congress leader Bacha Pathak
 1969 se saat baar unhone is vidhansabha seat par raaj kiya
 After Bacha Pathak, Ramgovind Chaudhary's entry here
 wo yahaan 2002 main chunaav jite
 He was also a minister in the Mulayam cabinet
 phir 2007 main haar gayi
 But again he won from SP in 2012 and was a minister
 wo hameshaa congress ke khilaaf ladate rahe
 This time too Congress had many contenders but this seat remained with them from the alliance
 baliya kii hiprophile seat rahi bansadih ke ilaake main kai diggaj netaa bade mantri rahe lekin ye ilaaka aabhaavon se jujhataa rahaa
 Every year natural calamity wreaks havoc here
 garmi ke dinon main aag or baadh ke dinon main palaayan yahaan badi samasya he
 No one to take the prize aise main yahaan bade dalon ke ummidavaaron ke bina bhi chunaav kam dilachasp nahin

 Bansdih, which is the high profile seat of Ballia, has many veteran leaders in the area, but this area has been struggling with lack of strength
 har saal prakritik aapadaa yahaan kahar barpati he
 Migration is a major problem here during summer and fire days
 jiskaa purasaahaal lene vaala koi nahin
 In such a situation, even without the candidates of big parties, the election is no less interesting

 Such activities in the border areas can pose a threat to the internal security of the country because by taking advantage of the darkness, terrorists can create disturbances in the border of India

 How is this possible when a decade ago, the Union Home Minister gave the number of illegal immigrants in Assam to over 40 lakhs

 Now that the NRC is benefiting illegal immigrants and not native citizens here

 Saying that this is not right 'das ne saaf kiya ki jaldi hi rajya main bade virodh pradarshan kiye jaaenge
 People will be made aware to ensure that people do not get angry with the ruling party (BJP)

 aamtaur par karmchaaree offis ko tanaav vaali jagah hi maanate hai
 Due to the work pressure and the race to meet the target every month, the tension on some employees' faces also becomes evident
 lekin agar aap tension or tanaav se dur rahanaa chaahate hai to in tips ko apanaakar offis main khush rah sakate hai
 
 
 1
 offis main apane sahakarmiyon ke saath acha rishta rakhen
 Obviously there will be some people in the office, whose behavior you may not like, but there will definitely be something special among them
 isliye apane sahakarmiyon kii khaas baton ko seekhney kii koshish karen or maahaul dostana banaae rakhen
 Because work stress is already present in the office, in such a situation, if there is tension in the environment, then working will start to be a burden
 intervyuu main jane se pehle kar len ye ek kaam, job main milegi madad2
 You should understand that the person who does the work, mistakes also happen to him
 isliye kaam ko lekar yadi koi negative feedback mila he to use sweekaar karen or usapar khijhane kii bajaay sudhaar karne kii koshish karen or haa us vyakti ko thankyuu jarur kahen
 Because in today's era, every person is ready to take advantage of other's mistakes
 3
 Work stress is because we do not make the same plan properly
 darasal, apane lakshya ko dhyaan main rakhte hue agar planning ke saath kama kiya jaae to kaam karte vakt na to tanaav mahasoos hoga or na hi bojhil hoga kaam
 If you have got promotion, then work like this and become perfect senior 4
 aamtaur par ham sab offis main multi tasking kii galati jarur karte hai
 Multi tasking means multiple tasks at once
 isse aapaki speed kam ho jaati he or ek kaam par aap ekagra bhi nahin kar pate

 There is no hurry
 logon ko dhairya rakhana chahie
 Kareena, 31, and her 10-year-old Saif have been having an affair since 2007
 apane pita mansoor ali khan pataudi ke nidhan ke baad saf ko 2011 main pataudi kaa 10waan nawab ghoshit kiya gaya tha
 The history of the country and the world records several incidents on the day of September 21, in which they are prominent
 1938:sitambar ko africa ke tat ke paas da great hurricane paidaa hone laga
 Its intensity increased steadily

 1971: a plane from Britain's Royal Air Force crashes in the city of Cambridgeshire

 The Rio Olympics has brought a very bad news for India
 bhartiya pahalwaan narsingh yadav par doping kii vajah se chaar saal kaa bain laga diya gaya he
 With this, wrestler Narsingh will not be able to participate in Rio Olympics
 narsingh ne is ore naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ki khel se thik 12 ghante pehle unase desh ke liye gold jeetne kaa unka sapana chin liya gaya
 i have the same battle left now: Narasimha Yadav said in this whole matter, 'I have suffered a lot in the last two months
 lekin is dauraan mere man main sirf ek baat thi ki desh ke sammaan ke liye ladanaa he
 My dream of winning the medal for the country in Rio was brutally snatched from me 12 hours before the game

 a four-year ban on wrestler Narsingh Yadav refused to accept Nada's decision
 unhone faisla sunaaya ki unke khaane yaa pine main milawat kii baat sahi nahin he
 The court also refused to accept Narasimha's argument that he had a conspiracy

 WFI President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh said that the Committee on Sports Arbitration was adamant on finding out if there was any conspiracy then why the culprit was not yet punished

 ' Our country's army is considered the second largest army in the world
 aazaadee ke baad ladi gai ladaaiyon main dushman ne hameshaa hi munh kii khai he
 Our soldiers have given a befitting reply to every attack by every enemy on the border
 lekin sena main bhartee hue javaanon kii behatari yaa phir sena ke mordenigeshan par kitna dhyaan dene kii jarurat he, pakistan kii taraf se lagaataar ho rahe sijafire ulanghan, ISIS kaa bharat conection or kashmir main sena kii bhoomika jaise muddon par ajtak web ne khaas baatcheet kii sena main major general rah chuke pike sahagal se
 Major General PK Sehgal, who retired in 2002, has served in several high posts in the army
 sahagal army dephence college ke head rah chuke hai
 Sehgal has given special training to nearly three thousand army soldiers in the Army College
 saath hi saath neshnal dephence academy, khadgavaasla main bhi sahagal ne apni sevaayen di hai
 Sehgal has also commanded the Air Defense Brigade of the Indian Army
 kargil yuddh ke vakt bhi major general pike sahagal ne vishesh bhoomika adaa kii thi
 Although Sehgal has been associated with social work since retirement, his special information in the Indian Army and Defense machinery is still used by the Government of India
 padhie major general pike sahagal se baatcheet ke mukhya ansh:pakistan kii taraf se lagaataar ho rahe sijafire ulanghan ko rokane ke liye bharat sarkaar ko kis tarah ke thos kadam uthaane chahie?dekhie, pakistan ke taraf se jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he wo unki sarkaar kii naakaami he
 The whole world knows who rules in Pakistan
 vahaan, vahi hota he jo ISI, pakistani sena or aatanki sanghathan chaahate hai
 Government of India should pressurize Pakistan for bilateral talks
 yuddh hi ekmaatr vikalp nahin he, is mudde ko bina vaarta kiye hal nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Government of India is making every effort to put pressure on Pakistan
 jahaan tak sena kii baat he to sena kii taraf se pakistan ko eent kaa jawaab pathar se diya ja rahaa he
 Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been repeatedly trying to put the issue of Kashmir on the international stage
 aise main bharat kaa rukh kya hona chahie?navaj sharif jo bhi kar rahe hai wo ISI ke dabaav main kar rahe hai
 At the time when Nawaz came to attend Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony, it seemed that everything was fine but Nawaz Sharif was severely condemned in Pakistan when he came to India
 aise main navaj sharif par ISI kaa dabaav or bhi bad gaya he
 Even if Pakistan can reach any point and chant Kashmir, no one can deny that Kashmir is an integral part of India and only India and Pakistan can solve this problem by dialogue among themselves
 bharat ko is mudde par america or yuan kii madhyasthata kii bilkul bhi jarurat nahin he
 How dangerous is Pakistan's nuclear power and Pakistan's help from China? India has no fear of any kind
 koi bhi mudda ladaai se nahin suljhaayaa ja saktaa
 If Pakistan thinks that India is afraid of having nuclear power, then it is a misunderstanding
 pakistan ko bharat se baat kerani hi hogi
 And as far as China is concerned, it is true that China is continuously helping Pakistan from behind the scenes
 lekin bharat ne is mudde par china se baat kii he or usapar dabaav banane kii koshish jari he
 What are the hopes of reforms related to Pakistan? See, we should always think positive
 agle 10 saal ke bheetar pakistan se hamaare rishte nishchit taur par behatar honge
 Because in Pakistan too, there are many problems with which he is constantly struggling
 aise main bharat ek aisa desh he jo uski madad kar saktaa he
 i think this thing will be understood by Pakistan soon and it will definitely try to improve relations with India
 ISIS desh ke liye kitna bada khatra he?isis ko main bada khatra nahin maanata
 Today there is a strong government in the country
 hamaari jamini, samudri or hawaii simaaen pehle se zyada surakshit hai
 We are constantly striving to further strengthen our external and internal intelligence 
 ISIS ko jawaab bhi usee ke andaaj main dene ke liye ham taiyaar hai
 How ready is our army and intelligence for this? First of all, i would like to say openly that the previous UPA government has not done any work to make our army, external intelligence and internal intelligence even better
 pichley 10 saalon main sena main maujuud kai kamiyon ko dur kiya ja saktaa tha lekin UPA sarkaar ne is ore dhyaan nahin diya
 The previous government neither paid attention to the mordenization of the army and intelligence nor took any steps for the betterment of the army personnel
 lekin in sabake baavjood sena or intelligence ne apana kaam bakhubi kiya or kisi bhi halaat se nipatane ke liye taiyaar hai
 However, let me say that the army has a lot of expectations from the new government
 philhal sena or intelligence ko or bhi behatar banane kii jarurat he
 The military needs mordenization
 narendra modi ne baar-baar sena ko majbootee dene kii baat kahi he or ummid he wo is par jald hi kaam karenge
 The role of the army in Jammu and Kashmir is often questioned
 kashmiriyon kii ye shikaayat rahati he ki sena kaa ravaiya unke prati thik nahin he
 In such a situation, how difficult is it for the army to maintain trust among the people there? The Kashmiri people are very good
 sena ke saath unke rishte bhi bahut achche hai
 Yes, there are some anti-social elements who keep doing something to create trouble
 sena vahaan ke sthaneey logon ke saath milakar campan bhi chalaati he
 Now the people of Kashmir have started to understand that they were being fooled till now
 haal hi main ai jaanaleva baadh main jo bhartiya sena ne logon ko bachaane main sakriyata dikhaai he wo vaaki kaabil-e-tarif he
 This has had a good impact on the Kashmiris and their thinking towards the Indian Army has changed
 aapane neshnal security or sena se jude kai ahm muddon par hamase baat kii, iske liye aapkaa dhanyavad
 PK Sehgal: Thank you

 The scam was actually disclosed in 2009 by former Health Secretary Shivendu, who had a sharp and clean image
 maamle kii jaanch main teji tab ai jab sibiai ne agast, 2009 main purv swasthya sachivon pradeep kumaar or siyaaraam prasad sinha ke khilaaf maamla darj kar chhapemari shuru kii
 Shahi's involvement was revealed at the time when Rajesh Fogla, the owner of the drug and medical equipment supplier Messrs Nandkishore Fogla, admitted in his statement that Shahi had given him 2 in the name of awarding contracts
 14 karod ru
 Were taken as commission
 shahi funsate najar aa rahe hai kyonki dawaaiyon kii aapurti karne vaali company annu interprijej ne bhi sibiai ko die bayaan main mana he ki purv mantri ne theka dene ke naam par 16

 DSP b of the CBI investigating the case
 ke
 Singh only states, "technically, Shahi should not have played any role in the purchase of NRHM
" lekin mantri sahit sachivon ne is bhrashtachar ko anjaam diya
 All the accused are related to each other, which we have strong evidence
 '' sibiai enarechaem ke liye dawa or chikitsa upkarnon kii aapurti karne vaali 19 companiyon messors nandakishor phogla, jeaar pharma, savitri cells, satyasai interprijej, annu interprijej, kalyaan interprijej, indo labs limited, lakshmi medical industry sahit anya ke dastavejon kii jaanch puri kar chuki he
 But the biggest game of scandal occurred in the purchase of mobile medical unit
 sutara bataate hai ki enarechaem ke nirdesh ke mutabik jharkhand ke 24 jilon ke liye ek-ek unit khareednaa tha
 Siyaram Prasad, in his time, had a much higher rate of Rs 66 lakh
 prati unit ke hisaab se 24 gadiyon kii kharid kar lee thi, jisaki jaanch bhi chal rahi he
 Pradeep ordered to purchase 79 additional units
 iske liye latehar main prastaavit 500 bistar vaale aspataal ke mad ke fund ko divert kiya gaya
 An agreement was reached with Babko, a company of Gajanan Malotia of Jamshedpur
 gupachup tareeke se tender nikaala gaya or tender main sirf teen companiyaan shaamil huin jinamein se do kaagaj par thim, jiske maalik gajanan ke putr naveen, krishna or nitish the

 Was not more than qaraar hone ke thik ghante bhar ke bheetar bebako ko 40 karod ru
 Was paid in advance and the money was invested in HDFC mutual funds
 yahi nahin, enarechaem ke disha-nirdeshon kaa ulanghan kar jarurat se adhik dawa kii kharid kii gai
 One item of funds was spent on another item and the Center was given an incorrect report
 swasthya sachiv rahete hue siyaaraam prasad ne vitt varsh 2007-08 main 17
 26 lakhs
 hyaddh herafavri kii jabaki 2008-09 main pradeep ke samay yah raashi badhkar 21

 Without any investigation, it was decided that the population of three crore of Jharkhand is anemic, for which it is necessary to buy iron tablets

 10 crores Rs
 kii herbal medicine jisaki gunvattta sandigdh thi ko kharida gaya
 In a way, State Drug Controller Madan Mohan should have objected to this, which he did not do
 sibiai ke espi ramchandra choudhary bataate hai, ''ham logon ne jaanch ke dauraan taarkik ant par pahunchane ke baad hi aaropapatr daakhil kiya he
 Shahi and Pradeep, who are influential in politics and administration, surrendered at an interval of two days
 shahi ko 'chote sarkaar' kahlaana pasand tha or kabhi ranchi ke upayukta rah chuke pradeep ranchi kaa bos kehalaate the
 But both were single at the time of surrender
 beshak isi se samajha ja saktaa he ki shahi or unke purv saathiyon ke aane vaale din koi bahut achche nahin hai

 Due to the fire, all the contents of the room burned to ashes
 is kamare main rahane vaali do ladkiyaan iraq kii hai jinka passport bhi jal gaya he
 They say that up to six lakh items were burnt
 pankhaa tut kar neeche aa gira
 Thankfully there was no one in the room at that time, otherwise if the three girls were here then anything could have happened
 aag kii is ghatana ne hostel kii suraksha vyavastha kii pole khol di
 The guards did not know how to use fire extinguishers and the students were not even given training on what to do if there was a fire
 1941 main bana tha espie
 It is the oldest and reputed institute in the country where planning and architect studies
 is college kii sthapana isliye kii gai thi ki yahaan se nikalne vaale chaatr gaanv, shahar or anya kshetron main planning karne main madad karenge
 Seeing the planning of towns, you can be sure that no one has ever studied architects and planning in India
 2015 main sansad dwaara kanoon paas kar ise rashtriya mahatv ke santhaan ke rup main ghoshit kiya gaya
 Students of this institute of national importance also understand the importance of the movement
 loktantr main agar aapane dharna yaa pradarshan nahin diya, yaa shaamil nahin hue, yakicanan aapane loktantr jiyaa hi nahin
 Taking the banner in hand is the most beautiful scene of democracy
 aise drishyon ke bagair na to aap naagarik banate hai or na manushya
 These words written on the banner are not just slogans but poetry
 ise uthaa kar jab aap class room se nikal kar college ke campus ke kisi angan main jamaa hone pahunch rahe hote hai tab aap apane bheetar ke bhay se azaad ho rahe hote hai or bolne kaa farz adaa karne kii taiyaari kar chuke hote hai
 Speaking is to improve oneself
 espie ke ye chaatr aag kii suraksha ko lekar yahaan jamaa ho chuke hai
 It is the strength of the group that makes administration polite
 pehle din andekha karne ke baad duusare din jab andolan chalaa to college ke dean haazir ho gaye
 Students have started answering questions from the Dean
 sawaal hi nahin kiya to aapane jivan kya jiyaa
 SPA is Dimmed University
 1200 chaatr padhate hai
 Nevertheless, the list of problems of hostels here is quite long
 ek chaatr ne bataaya ki hostel main pani saaf nahin aata he jisaki vajah se chaatr baahar se pani kii bottle karidate hai
 a student spends thousand to fifteen hundred rupees on water
 ceiling tut kar girti rahati he
 Students tell that snakes also come here
 bandar or chuuhe to aate jate hi rahete hai
 The agitating students have searched the entire budget of the college
 baqayda notice board par laga diya he
 The institute is facing budget cuts even after being on the priority list
 2013-14 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 45 karod magar mila 28 karod
 SPA budget provision in 2014-15 was 46 crores but got 30 crores
 2015-16 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 40 karod magar mila 26 karod
 You see how the budget is getting less
 iskaa asar yahaan kii buniyadi suvidhaon par pad rahaa he
 There should be a doctor in college but there is not
 dawa bhi uplabdh nahin he
 The girls hostel has only eight toilets on one floor while sixty girls live there
 unke hisaab se yah kaaphi kam he
 SPA students said that cleanliness was in bad shape
 andolan ke dauraan unhone is kachare ko saaf kar jamaa kar diya
 Students say that mosquitoes rule the campus due to which many students have dengue
 puraane cooler kaa kabad yahaan jamaa he
 By the way, you go to the mohallas of Delhi, old cars and scooters are frozen as junk
 koi hataane vaala nahin he
 The condition of the campus is also similar
 espie dimd uniwarsity he
 Here too, there are not as many teachers as there should be
 aankade bataate hai ki manzur padon kii tulana main kam shikshak hai or shikshakon kii sankhya kam hi hoti ja rahi he
 In 2014, 32 positions were approved for professors, 29 were professors
 2014 se lekar 2016 tak yah sankhya 29 se kam hokar 23 par pahunch gai
 In 2014, 44 posts of Associate Professor were approved but 30 were working
 2014 main 30 associat professor the or 2016 main 31, yani 13 kii kami he
 There is also a shortage of teachers in the School of Planning and Architects
 ab chalate hai rajasthan
 The system here uses one word, work arrangement
 kaary vyavasthaarth kaa matlab yah hua ki aap college a main padhaate hai or college ba main teacher nahin he to aapako teen maheene ke liye college ba main bhej diya jayega
 But the college a teacher got so upset that he got a stay from the court
 to ab nayaa tarika nikaala gaya he
 Send the lecturer to another college for 15 days
 isi system ko kaary vyavasthaarth kehete hai
 There is also work in it, system is also there, it is also real and it is also meaning sab milakar banate hai kaary vyavasthaarth yani samasya saakshaat
 The Government of Rajasthan has issued the order on 21 October
 aadesh jari karne vaali sanstha kaa naam he ayuktalay college shiksha, rajasthan, jaipur
 The entire chart is made in this order
 bataaya gaya he ki kis college se teacher ko kis college main 15 din ke liye bheja jayega
 According to this order, two teachers will be sent alternately for 15 days in a teacher-less college
 donon par zimmedaari hogi ki 30 dinon ke bheetar paathyakram puraa karne kaa prayaas karenge
 Only after informing the principal will he leave for his native college
 30 dinon main course puraa karne ke liye 279 shikshakon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Can two teachers together complete any course in 30 days? Churan is being sold openly to make India a world guru
 ye idia chuuran hi he kyonki 30 din main paathyakram puraa karne ke kamaal kii ummid bharat ke hi shikshakon se hi kii ja sakati he
 From where these teachers will be removed for 15-15 days, then the subject will stop
 isse rajasthan ke ek college main ek saal main course puraa hoga or ek saal main 30 din
 This is an amazing idea
 aap dekh rahe hai ragadrabari, college sarkari or chaatr tarkari
 But on this list, it was known that where there are zero teachers
 chaumahala rajkeey mahavidhyalay main bhugol kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is no Sanskrit teacher in Manoharathana Government College
 manoharthana mahavidhyalay main samajashaastra main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Khanpur Government College has zero teachers in History, Geography, Sociology
 samasya kaa samaadhaan yahi hoga ki shikshakon kii sthaayee niyukti kii jaae
 Till exportable teachers are not ready, then these vacant positions can be filled only by import
 is suchi main kai shaharon ke naam hai jinka uccharan tivi par nahin hota he
 Such as Khetri, Jhadoul, Kekri
 yahaan ke rajkeey collejon ke kai vishyon main zero teacher hai
 This list shows that there is a lot of emphasis on the posting of Sanskrit teachers in many colleges
 akhir sanskrit kaa apmaan, nahin sahegaa hindustan tip naare deevaaron par likhane se pehle kuch to karke dikhaanaa hi hoga
 Sanskrit teachers are being sent for 30 days
 jab teacher nahin the tab bhi sanskrit ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa tha, ab jah 30 din main course puraa karaane kaa prayaas karenge to yah mazaaq nahin, laughter chalange hoga
 It is written in the order that the fare to be paid will be paid
 15 din thaharne, khaane pine ke bare main aadesh spasht nahin he
 The status of guest teacher is not good
 15-15 dinon ke liye bheje jane kaa yah idia nayaa he kyonki pehle teen teen maheene ke liye shikshak bheje jate the to iske khilaaf shikshak court chale gaye or ste le aae
 To avoid this, a laughter challenge has come to complete the course in 15 days
 jafar multani ne madhya pradesh ke agar malwa se guest shikshakon kii ek samasya kii taraf dhyaan khinchne ke liye story bheji he
 You know that the guest teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called a guest scholar
 is hisaab se vahaan ke permanent teacher ko vidwaan samajha jaataa he yaa nahin, pataa nahin
 The guest as well as the scholar, will hear that they are more interested
 magar sabase zyaada shoshan inhen kaa hota he
 If you compile the terminology nomenclature used to hire teachers in colleges, then the entire book will be made
 yahaan ke shaskeey nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan namita 70 kimi dur se padhaane aati he
 Namita has been a university topper
 kuch dinon pehle namita kaa utaras kii surgery hui thi
 The government rules that no guest scholar can take seven consecutive days off
 saat dinon se zyaada avkaash legaa to kaary mukt kar diya jayega yani hataa diya jayega
 Namita also traveled to surgery to save her job and kept coming to college
 vaise bhi jo selary milti he wo car ke petrol par hi karch ho jaati he
 Think about how much leave a female guest scholar will get when she becomes a mother
 hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki atithi vidwaan ko matternity live maatrutiv avkaash kii paatrata nahin he
 You did not feel fond of, did not engage in English, then it was not surprising in Hindi
 yahi nahin atithi vidwaan ke liye bhi zaruri he ki ve seminar main jaaen, paper pragent karen magar jab ve jate hai to vetan cat jaataa he
 When a permanent teacher goes, his salary is not deducted
 aapako iske peeche kaa tark samaj aayaa
 Now come to Mumbai University
 iske itihaas main pehali baar vaais chancelar ko barkhaast kiya gaya he
 Sanjay Deshmukh, who has got his name recorded in history, kept making history in some other cases
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh visi banane se pehle 2015 main elelbi kii pariksha main fail ho gaye the
 Even after this, he was made the VC of the University of 774 colleges
 times of india ne likhaa he ki ve aresas ke kareebi hai
 The RSS should distance itself from Sanjay Deshmukh as Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh has made record overseas trips during his tenure
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne bataaya ki unhone 100 karod kii fiks dipazit tod di
 It is also being learned that the Vice Chancellor had wanted to buy the plane with the money of the students
 hawaii jahaaz
 Our Vice Chancellors ruined the university but they will be the first who dreamed of buying a plane after the ruin
 agar yah sahi he to visi banane se pehle likhva lenaa chahie ki main niyukt karne vaale ke raajnneetik agenda ko chalaate hue uniwarsity ko jald se jald barbaad kar duungaa magar uske paise se hawaii jahaaz nahin kharidoongaa
 Heart beats telling this news
 jane kyon lag rahaa he ki aisa nahin hua hoga magar sohit mishra ne bataaya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz udaane hetu privet license ke liye applai bhi kiya
 i wish this news was wrong
 hawaii jahaaz kareedne ke saath ye udaana bhi chaahate the
 This is not true VC payalat kaa karcha bachaane kii sochi
 If the CBI, ED, by the work of fixing the opposition
 iskar vibhaag kuch ghante ke liye free ho to sanjay deshmukh se bhi mil aana chahie
 The opposition accuses these investigative agencies that they are behind them, not anyone else
 vaise big braking news yahi he ki vishvavidhyalay main aircraft kareedne kaa prastaav paas nahin hua
 The comments is bich dobaaraa kapi check karaane kii maang karne vaale chaatro ne maidan badal diya he
 Now they have come out of university grounds to Azad Maidan
 dobaaraa pariksha kii fees vruddhi se naaraaz hai
 The fee of Rs 500 has been increased to Rs 1050
 sochie sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz kareed liya hota to gazab ho jaataa
 Children would run on the streets of Mumbai carrying banners and laughing while flying ships over VC sea
 yahuu yahuu karte rahe
 Students still perform
 sanvida par, theke par, anshkalik padhaane vaale teacher to pradarshan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 We are teaching less than the minimum wage, we cannot get leave if we are ill, we are going to college in Bukhar, and you are killing us by making us laugh that we are going to become world gurus
 brake le lijie broken system kaa ek or namoona dikhaaungaa, bharat main krabian or shmashaan ko lekar sirf sampradayik raajnneeti hi nahin ho sakati he, logon ne sabit kar diya he ki ve is maamle main ghotaalaa bhi kar sakate hai
 Except for the performance of the students of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Banaras, students everywhere were seen speaking the same sentences as their principals, the way their housemates, the chamol
 duusari taraf mumbai universti ke chaatro ke andolan main zid dikhi, naare sunai die or tevar bhi
 The performance of students of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Banaras does not reveal whether they are performing rituals or committing democracy
 School of Planning and Architecture main chaatro kii narebaazi 26 oktober kii subah 9 baje se chal rahi he
 They shouted slogans outside the campus all night
 jin maangon ko lekar pradarshan kar rahe the, unhen dekhakar dilli se baahar ke chaatr yahi soch rahe honge ki inase zyaada samasya to hamaare yahaan hai magar ham log to edjust kar gaye hai, ye kyon hai hai kar rahe hai
 Actually, our political and social values seem to have gone away
 ab ham fasebuk par hi bolne ko bolnaa samajhate hai, athurity yaa prashasan ke saamne kuch zyaada hi chup rahane lage hai
 This fire is the cause of this movement of SPA
 26 oktober kii subah 5 baje ke kareeb campus ke girls hostel main shot circuit se aag lag gai
 At the time of the fire, there was no girl in the room
 aag ke kaaran kamare kaa sara saamaan jal kar raakh ho gaya
 The two girls living in this room are from Iraq whose passport is also burnt
 inkaa kahana he ki chah lakh tak ke saamaan jal gaye
 The fan broke down and came down
 ganimat he ki us vakt kamare main koi nahin tha, varanaa agar teenon ladkiyaan yahaan hoti to kuch bhi ho saktaa tha
 This incident of fire exposed the security of the hostel
 guard ko aag bujhane ke silendar kaa istemaal karnaa nahin aata tha or chaatraon ko bhi training nahin di gai thi ki aag lagane par kya karnaa he
 SPA was formed in 1941
 yah desh kaa sabase purana or pratishthit santhaan he jahaan planning or architect kii padhai hoti he
 This college was established so that the students coming out of it will help in planning in the village, city and other areas
 kasbon kii planning kaa haal dekhakar aap nishcint ho sakate hai ki bharat main kabhi kisi ne architect or planning kii kabhi padhai hi nahin kii he
 In 2015, it was declared as an institution of national importance by passing legislation by the Parliament
 rashtriya mahatv ke is santhaan ke chaatr andolan ke mahatv ko bhi samajhate hai
 If you did not protest or participate in democracy, or did not join, then you did not live democracy
 haath main binar lekar chalanaa loktantr kaa sabase kuubasurat drishy he
 Without such scenes neither you become a citizen nor a human being
 binar par likhe ye shabd sirf naare nahin hai balki kavita hai
 By picking this up, when you are coming out of the class room to gather in a courtyard on the campus of the college, then you are freed from your inner fear and have prepared to pay the duty of speaking
 bolnaa khud ko behatar karnaa he
 These students of SPA have gathered here for the safety of fire
 samooh kii yah takat hi he jo prashasan ko vinamr banaati he
 After ignoring the first day, when the agitation went on the second day, the Dean of the college appeared
 chaatr dean se sawaal jawaab karne lage hai
 If you did not question, what did you live? espie dimd uniwarsity he
 1200 students study
 phir bhi yahaan ke hostel kii samasyaon kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 One student said that water does not come clean in the hostel, due to which students buy bottles of water from outside
 ek chaatr pani par hazaar se pandrah sau rupee karch karata he
 The ceiling keeps falling apart
 chaatr bataate hai ki yahaan saanp bhi aate hai
 Monkeys and rats keep coming
 andolan karne vaale chaatro ne college kaa puraa bajet chaan maaraa he
 The notice board has been installed
 yah santhaan praathamikta suchi main hone ke baad bhi bajet kii katautee kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 In 2013-14, the budget provision of SPA was 45 crores but got 28 crores
 2014-15 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 46 karod magar mila 30 karod
 In 2015-16, the budget provision of SPA was 40 crores but got 26 crores
 aap dekh rahe hai ki kis tarah bajet kam mil rahaa he
 This is affecting the basic facilities here
 college main doctor hona chahie magar nahin he
 Medication is also not available
 girls hostel main ek floor par aath hi shauchalay hai jabaki saath chatraayen rahati hai
 According to him this is quite low
 espie ke chaatro ne bataaya ki safai kaa bura haal he
 During the movement, he cleaned and deposited this waste
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki campus main machharon kaa raaj he jisaki vajah se kai chaatro ko dengue ho chukaa he
 The junk of the old cooler is stored here
 vaise aap dilli ke mohallon main jaaiye puraani gaadiyaan or scooter kabad ke rup main jame hue hai
 There is no removal
 campus kaa haal bhi kuch aisa hi he
 SPA is deemed university
 yahaan bhi jitne shikshak hone chahie utane nahin hai
 Statistics show that there are fewer teachers than the sanctioned posts and the number of teachers is decreasing
 2014 main professor ke liye 32 pad manzur hai, 29 professor the
 From 2014 to 2016, this number decreased from 29 to 23
 2014 main associat professor ke 44 pad manzur the magar kaam kar rahe the 30
 There were 30 associate professors in 2014 and 31 in 2016, a decrease of 13
 skool of planning and architector main bhi shikshakon kii kami he
 Now let's go to Rajasthan
 yahaan ke system main ek shabd kaa istamaal hota he, kaary vyavasthaarth
 Work arrangement means that you teach in college a and there is no teacher in college B, then you will be sent to college b for three months
 magar college a ke teacher itane pareshaan ho gaye ki court se ste le aae
 So now a new method has been worked out
 lekturer ko 15 dinon ke liye kisi duusare college main bhejo
 This system is called work system
 isamen kaary bhi he, vyavastha bhi, yatharth bhi he or arthath bhi he
 All are made together, that is, the system of work ie problem
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 21 oktober ko aadesh jari kiya he
 The name of the organization that issued the order is Commissionerate College Education, Rajasthan, Jaipur
 is aadesh main puraa chart bana he
 It has been told that from which college the teacher will be sent to which college for 15 days
 is aadesh ke mutabik shikshakavihin college main do shikshak baari baari se 15-15 din ke liye bheje jaaenge
 Both will have responsibility to attempt to complete the course within 30 days
 isaki soochna principal ko dene ke baad hi apane mul college kii taraf prasthaan karenge
 279 teachers have been selected to complete the course in 30 days
 kya do teacher milakar 30 din main kisi bhi paathyakram ko puraa kar sakate he? bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran khuleam bechaa ja rahaa he
 This idea is the only one because it can be expected from the teachers of India that it is amazing to complete the course in 30 days
 jahaan se ye teacher 15-15 din ke liye hataae jaaenge vahaan to vishay tham jayega
 This will complete the course in one year in a college in Rajasthan and 30 days in a year
 kamaal kaa idia he na
 You are watching Ragdarbari, college government and students
 lekin is suchi yah to pataa chal gaya ki kahaan kahaan zero teacher hai
 There is no teacher of Geography in Chaumhala Government College
 manoharthana rajkeey mahavidhyalay main sanskrit kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is also no teacher in Sociology at Manorathana College
 khanpur rajkeey mahavidhyalay main itihaas, bhugol, samajashaastra main zero teacher hai
 The solution to the problem will be to make permanent appointment of teachers
 niryaat karne laayak shikshak taiyaar nahin hote hai tab tak aayaat se hi in khaali padon ko bharaa ja saktaa he
 This list has names of many cities that are not pronounced on TV
 jaise khetadi, jhaadol, kekadi
 There are zero teachers in many subjects of state colleges here
 is suchi se pataa chalata he ki kai collejon main sanskrit ke shikshakon kii padasthapana par khaasaa jor diya gaya he
 After all, Sanskrit will not be insulted, Hindustan type slogans have to be shown before doing anything on the walls
 30 din ke liye sanskrit ke shikshak bheje ja rahe hai
 Even when there were no teachers, i was having fun with Sanskrit, now when i try to complete the course in 30 days, it will be a laughter challenge, not a joke
 aadesh main likhaa he ki aane jane kaa kiraaya diya jayega
 The order regarding 15 days stay, food and drink is not clear
 guest teacher kii sthiti thik nahin he
 This idea of sending for 15-15 days is new because the teacher was sent for the first three months, then the teacher went to court and brought a stay against it
 lagata he isse bachane ke liye 15 din main course puraa karne kaa laughter chalange aayaa he
 Zafar Multani has sent a story from Agar Malwa in Madhya Pradesh to draw attention to a problem of guest teachers
 aap jaanate hai ki madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 According to this, whether the permanent teacher there is considered a scholar or not is not known
 atithi bhi or vidwaan bhi, sunakar lagegaa ki zyaada khatiradaari inhen kii hoti he
 But these are the most exploited
 collejon main shikshakon ko theke par rakhane kii jo shabdaawalee namavali kaa prayog hua he, uskaa sankalan karenge to puri ek kitaab ban jaaegi
 Guest scholar Namita comes to teach at the Government Nehru College here from 70 km away
 namita uniwarsity topper rahi hai
 Namita had Uterus surgery a few days ago
 sarkaar kaa niyam he ki koi bhi atithi vidwaan lagaataar saat dinon kaa avkaash nahin le saktaa he
 If you take more than seven days off, then the work will be freed, ie will be removed
 namita naukari bachaane ke liye surgery kii hilat main bhi safar karti raheen or college aati rahi
 Anyway, the salary you get is spent on the petrol of the car itself
 aap sochie mahila atithi vidwaan ko maa banane par kitni chuttee milti hogi
 When we found out, it was told that the guest scholar does not qualify for maternity leave maternity leave
 aapako shauking nahin laga, angrezi main nahin laga to kya hindi main hairaani nahin hui
 Not only this, it is also important for the guest scholar to go to seminar, present the paper, but the salary is deducted when they go
 permanent teacher jate hai to unka vetan nahin katataa he
 You understand the reasoning behind this
 ab aaiye mumbai uniwarsity
 For the first time in its history, the Vice Chancellor has been dismissed
 itihaas main barkhaastagi se apana naam darz karaane vaale sanjay deshmukh kuch or maamalon main itihaas banaate banaate rah gaye
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh failed the LLB exam in 2015 before becoming a VC
 iske baad bhi ve 774 collejon kii uniwarsity kaa visi banaae gaye
 The Times of India has written that he is close to the RSS
 aresas ko sanjay deshmukh se duuri bana leni chahie kyonki anil galgali ne khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne apane kaarykaal main ricard videsh yatraaen kii hai
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra said that he broke the 100 million fixed deposit
 yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki vaais chancelar sahab vidhyaarthiyon ke paise se hawaii jahaaz kareednaa chaahate the
 The plane
 hamaare vaais chancelaron ne uniwarsity kii uniwarsity barbaad kar di magar ye pehle honge jinhone barbaad karne ke baad hawaii jahaaz kareedne kaa sapana dekha
 If this is true, then before writing a VC one should write that i will ruin the university as soon as possible by running the political agenda of the appointee but will not buy the plane with his money
 is khabar ko bataate hue dil dhadak rahaa he
 Know why it may not have happened, but Sohit Mishra has told that Sanjay Deshmukh has also applied for a private license to fly the ship
 kaash ye khabar galat ho
 They also wanted to fly along with buying airplanes
 ye hua na sachcha visi
 Thought to save the pilot's cost
 agar vipaksh ko fiks karne ke kaam se sibiai, idi
 If the income tax department is free for a few hours, then you should also meet Sanjay Deshmukh
 vipaksh in jaanch agenciyon par yahi aarope lagaataa he ki unheen ke peeche padi hai, kisi or ke nahin
 By the way, the big breaking news is that the proposal to buy aircraft at the university did not pass
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, students demanding a repeat check have changed the field
 ab ve uniwarsity ke maidan se nikal kar azaad maidan aa gaye hai
 Again annoyed with the increase in examination fees
 500 rupee kii fees ko badhaakar 1050 rupee kar die gaye hai
 Think if Sanjay Deshmukh had bought the ship, it would have been amazing
 bachche binar lekar mumbai kii sadakon par daudte rahete or visi samandar ke upar jahaaz udaate hue hansate rahete
 Yahoo continued to do Yahoo
 chaatr to phir bhi pradarshan kar lete hai
 On contract, on contract, part time teaching teachers cannot perform
 nunatam mazaduri se bhi kam par padhaa rahe hai, biimaar hote hai to chuttee nahin mil sakati, bukaar main college ja rahe hai, or aap hamen hansaa hansaa kar maare ja rahe hai ki ham vishwa guru banane vaale hai
 Take a break, i will show another example of the broken system, there can be not only communal politics in India on Krabistan and crematorium, people have proved that they can also scam in this matter
 School of Planning and Architecture main chaatro kii narebaazi 26 oktober kii subah 9 baje se chal rahi he

 yah santhaan praathamikta suchi main hone ke baad bhi bajet kii katautee kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 In 2013-14, the budget provision of SPA was 45 crores but got 28 crores
 2014-15 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 46 karod magar mila 30 karod
 In 2015-16, the budget provision of SPA was 40 crores but got 26 crores
 aap dekh rahe hai ki kis tarah bajet kam mil rahaa he
 This is affecting the basic facilities here
 college main doctor hona chahie magar nahin he
 Medication is also not available
 girls hostel main ek floor par aath hi shauchalay hai jabaki saath chatraayen rahati hai
 According to him this is quite low
 espie ke chaatro ne bataaya ki safai kaa bura haal he
 During the movement, he cleaned and deposited this waste
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki campus main machharon kaa raaj he jisaki vajah se kai chaatro ko dengue ho chukaa he
 The junk of the old cooler is stored here
 vaise aap dilli ke mohallon main jaaiye puraani gaadiyaan or scooter kabad ke rup main jame hue hai
 There is no removal
 campus kaa haal bhi kuch aisa hi he
 SPA is deemed university
 yahaan bhi jitne shikshak hone chahie utane nahin hai
 Statistics show that there are fewer teachers than the sanctioned posts and the number of teachers is decreasing
 2014 main professor ke liye 32 pad manzur hai, 29 professor the
 From 2014 to 2016, this number decreased from 29 to 23
 2014 main associat professor ke 44 pad manzur the magar kaam kar rahe the 30
 There were 30 associate professors in 2014 and 31 in 2016, a decrease of 13
 skool of planning and architector main bhi shikshakon kii kami he
 Now let's go to Rajasthan
 yahaan ke system main ek shabd kaa istamaal hota he, kaary vyavasthaarth
 Work arrangement means that you teach in college a and there is no teacher in college B, then you will be sent to college b for three months
 magar college a ke teacher itane pareshaan ho gaye ki court se ste le aae
 So now a new method has been worked out
 lekturer ko 15 dinon ke liye kisi duusare college main bhejo
 This system is called work system
 isamen kaary bhi he, vyavastha bhi, yatharth bhi he or arthath bhi he
 All are made together, that is, the system of work ie problem
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 21 oktober ko aadesh jari kiya he
 The name of the organization that issued the order is Commissionerate College Education, Rajasthan, Jaipur
 is aadesh main puraa chart bana he
 It has been told that from which college the teacher will be sent to which college for 15 days
 is aadesh ke mutabik shikshakavihin college main do shikshak baari baari se 15-15 din ke liye bheje jaaenge
 Both will have responsibility to attempt to complete the course within 30 days
 isaki soochna principal ko dene ke baad hi apane mul college kii taraf prasthaan karenge
 279 teachers have been selected to complete the course in 30 days
 kya do teacher milakar 30 din main kisi bhi paathyakram ko puraa kar sakate he? bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran khuleam bechaa ja rahaa he
 This idea is the only one because it can be expected from the teachers of India that it is amazing to complete the course in 30 days
 jahaan se ye teacher 15-15 din ke liye hataae jaaenge vahaan to vishay tham jayega
 This will complete the course in one year in a college in Rajasthan and 30 days in a year
 kamaal kaa idia he na
 You are watching Ragdarbari, college government and students
 lekin is suchi yah to pataa chal gaya ki kahaan kahaan zero teacher hai
 There is no teacher of Geography in Chaumhala Government College
 manoharthana rajkeey mahavidhyalay main sanskrit kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is also no teacher in Sociology at Manorathana College
 khanpur rajkeey mahavidhyalay main itihaas, bhugol, samajashaastra main zero teacher hai
 The solution to the problem will be to make permanent appointment of teachers
 niryaat karne laayak shikshak taiyaar nahin hote hai tab tak aayaat se hi in khaali padon ko bharaa ja saktaa he
 This list has names of many cities that are not pronounced on TV
 jaise khetadi, jhaadol, kekadi
 There are zero teachers in many subjects of state colleges here
 is suchi se pataa chalata he ki kai collejon main sanskrit ke shikshakon kii padasthapana par khaasaa jor diya gaya he
 After all, Sanskrit will not be insulted, Hindustan type slogans have to be shown before doing anything on the walls
 30 din ke liye sanskrit ke shikshak bheje ja rahe hai
 Even when there were no teachers, i was having fun with Sanskrit, now when i try to complete the course in 30 days, it will be a laughter challenge, not a joke
 aadesh main likhaa he ki aane jane kaa kiraaya diya jayega
 The order regarding 15 days stay, food and drink is not clear
 guest teacher kii sthiti thik nahin he
 This idea of sending for 15-15 days is new because the teacher was sent for the first three months, then the teacher went to court and brought a stay against it
 lagata he isse bachane ke liye 15 din main course puraa karne kaa laughter chalange aayaa he
 Zafar Multani has sent a story from Agar Malwa in Madhya Pradesh to draw attention to a problem of guest teachers
 aap jaanate hai ki madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 According to this, whether the permanent teacher there is considered a scholar or not is not known
 atithi bhi or vidwaan bhi, sunakar lagegaa ki zyaada khatiradaari inhen kii hoti he
 But these are the most exploited
 collejon main shikshakon ko theke par rakhane kii jo shabdaawalee namavali kaa prayog hua he, uskaa sankalan karenge to puri ek kitaab ban jaaegi
 Guest scholar Namita comes to teach at the Government Nehru College here from 70 km away
 namita uniwarsity topper rahi hai
 Namita had Uterus surgery a few days ago
 sarkaar kaa niyam he ki koi bhi atithi vidwaan lagaataar saat dinon kaa avkaash nahin le saktaa he
 If you take more than seven days off, then the work will be freed, ie will be removed
 namita naukari bachaane ke liye surgery kii hilat main bhi safar karti raheen or college aati rahi
 Anyway, the salary you get is spent on the petrol of the car itself
 aap sochie mahila atithi vidwaan ko maa banane par kitni chuttee milti hogi
 When we found out, it was told that the guest scholar does not qualify for maternity leave maternity leave
 aapako shauking nahin laga, angrezi main nahin laga to kya hindi main hairaani nahin hui
 Not only this, it is also important for the guest scholar to go to seminar, present the paper, but the salary is deducted when they go
 permanent teacher jate hai to unka vetan nahin katataa he
 You understand the reasoning behind this
 ab aaiye mumbai uniwarsity
 For the first time in its history, the Vice Chancellor has been dismissed
 itihaas main barkhaastagi se apana naam darz karaane vaale sanjay deshmukh kuch or maamalon main itihaas banaate banaate rah gaye
 RTI activist Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh failed the LLB exam in 2015 before becoming a VC
 iske baad bhi ve 774 collejon kii uniwarsity kaa visi banaae gaye
 The Times of India has written that he is close to the RSS
 aresas ko sanjay deshmukh se duuri bana leni chahie kyonki anil galgali ne khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne apane kaarykaal main ricard videsh yatraaen kii hai
 Our colleague Sohit Mishra said that he broke the 100 million fixed deposit
 yah bhi pataa chal rahaa he ki vaais chancelar sahab vidhyaarthiyon ke paise se hawaii jahaaz kareednaa chaahate the
 The plane
 hamaare vaais chancelaron ne uniwarsity kii uniwarsity barbaad kar di magar ye pehle honge jinhone barbaad karne ke baad hawaii jahaaz kareedne kaa sapana dekha
 If this is true, then before writing a VC one should write that i will ruin the university as soon as possible by running the political agenda of the appointee but will not buy the plane with his money
 is khabar ko bataate hue dil dhadak rahaa he
 Know why it may not have happened, but Sohit Mishra has told that Sanjay Deshmukh has also applied for a private license to fly the ship
 kaash ye khabar galat ho
 They also wanted to fly along with buying airplanes
 ye hua na sachcha visi
 Thought to save the pilot's cost
 agar vipaksh ko fiks karne ke kaam se sibiai, idi
 If the income tax department is free for a few hours, then you should also meet Sanjay Deshmukh
 vipaksh in jaanch agenciyon par yahi aarope lagaataa he ki unheen ke peeche padi hai, kisi or ke nahin
 By the way, the big breaking news is that the proposal to buy aircraft at the university did not pass
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, students demanding a repeat check have changed the field
 ab ve uniwarsity ke maidan se nikal kar azaad maidan aa gaye hai
 Again annoyed with the increase in examination fees
 500 rupee kii fees ko badhaakar 1050 rupee kar die gaye hai
 Think if Sanjay Deshmukh had bought the ship, it would have been amazing
 bachche binar lekar mumbai kii sadakon par daudte rahete or visi samandar ke upar jahaaz udaate hue hansate rahete
 Yahoo continued to do Yahoo
 chaatr to phir bhi pradarshan kar lete hai
 On contract, on contract, part time teaching teachers cannot perform
 nunatam mazaduri se bhi kam par padhaa rahe hai, biimaar hote hai to chuttee nahin mil sakati, bukaar main college ja rahe hai, or aap hamen hansaa hansaa kar maare ja rahe hai ki ham vishwa guru banane vaale hai
 Take a break, i will show another example of the broken system, there can be not only communal politics in India on Krabistan and crematorium, people have proved that they can also scam in this matter
 espie ke is andolan kii vajah he yah aag
 a fire broke out from the shot circuit at the Girls Hostel on campus around 5 am on 26 October
 jis vakt aag lagi, us vakt kamare main koi ladki nahin thi
 Due to the fire, all the contents of the room burned to ashes
 is kamare main rahane vaali do ladkiyaan iraq kii hai jinka passport bhi jal gaya he
 They say that up to six lakh items were burnt
 pankhaa tut kar neeche aa gira
 Thankfully there was no one in the room at that time, otherwise if the three girls were here then anything could have happened
 aag kii is ghatana ne hostel kii suraksha vyavastha kii pole khol di
 The guards did not know how to use fire extinguishers and the students were not even given training on what to do if there was a fire
 1941 main bana tha espie
 It is the oldest and reputed institute in the country where planning and architect studies
 is college kii sthapana isliye kii gai thi ki yahaan se nikalne vaale chaatr gaanv, shahar or anya kshetron main planning karne main madad karenge
 Seeing the planning of towns, you can be sure that no one has ever studied architects and planning in India
 2015 main sansad dwaara kanoon paas kar ise rashtriya mahatv ke santhaan ke rup main ghoshit kiya gaya
 Students of this institute of national importance also understand the importance of the movement
 loktantr main agar aapane dharna yaa pradarshan nahin diya, yaa shaamil nahin hue, yakicanan aapane loktantr jiyaa hi nahin
 Taking the banner in hand is the most beautiful scene of democracy
 aise drishyon ke bagair na to aap naagarik banate hai or na manushya
 These words written on the banner are not just slogans but poetry
 ise uthaa kar jab aap class room se nikal kar college ke campus ke kisi angan main jamaa hone pahunch rahe hote hai tab aap apane bheetar ke bhay se azaad ho rahe hote hai or bolne kaa farz adaa karne kii taiyaari kar chuke hote hai
 Speaking is to improve oneself
 espie ke ye chaatr aag kii suraksha ko lekar yahaan jamaa ho chuke hai
 It is the strength of the group that makes administration polite
 pehle din andekha karne ke baad duusare din jab andolan chalaa to college ke dean haazir ho gaye
 Students have started answering questions from the Dean
 sawaal hi nahin kiya to aapane jivan kya jiyaa
 SPA is Dimmed University
 1200 chaatr padhate hai
 Nevertheless, the list of problems of hostels here is quite long
 ek chaatr ne bataaya ki hostel main pani saaf nahin aata he jisaki vajah se chaatr baahar se pani kii bottle karidate hai
 a student spends thousand to fifteen hundred rupees on water
 ceiling tut kar girti rahati he
 Students tell that snakes also come here
 bandar or chuuhe to aate jate hi rahete hai
 The agitating students have searched the entire budget of the college
 baqayda notice board par laga diya he
 The institute is facing budget cuts even after being on the priority list
 2013-14 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 45 karod magar mila 28 karod
 SPA budget provision in 2014-15 was 46 crores but got 30 crores
 2015-16 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 40 karod magar mila 26 karod
 You see how the budget is getting less
 iskaa asar yahaan kii buniyadi suvidhaon par pad rahaa he
 There should be a doctor in college but there is not
 dawa bhi uplabdh nahin he
 The girls hostel has only eight toilets on one floor while sixty girls live there
 unke hisaab se yah kaaphi kam he
 SPA students said that cleanliness was in bad shape
 andolan ke dauraan unhone is kachare ko saaf kar jamaa kar diya
 Students say that mosquitoes rule the campus due to which many students have dengue
 puraane cooler kaa kabad yahaan jamaa he
 By the way, you go to the mohallas of Delhi, old cars and scooters are frozen as junk
 koi hataane vaala nahin he
 The condition of the campus is also similar
 espie dimd uniwarsity he
 Here too, there are not as many teachers as there should be
 aankade bataate hai ki manzur padon kii tulana main kam shikshak hai or shikshakon kii sankhya kam hi hoti ja rahi he
 In 2014, 32 positions were approved for professors, 29 were professors
 2014 se lekar 2016 tak yah sankhya 29 se kam hokar 23 par pahunch gai
 In 2014, 44 posts of Associate Professor were approved but 30 were working
 2014 main 30 associat professor the or 2016 main 31, yani 13 kii kami he
 There is also a shortage of teachers in the School of Planning and Architects
 ab chalate hai rajasthan
 The system here uses one word, work arrangement
 kaary vyavasthaarth kaa matlab yah hua ki aap college a main padhaate hai or college ba main teacher nahin he to aapako teen maheene ke liye college ba main bhej diya jayega
 But the college a teacher got so upset that he got a stay from the court
 to ab nayaa tarika nikaala gaya he
 Send the lecturer to another college for 15 days
 isi system ko kaary vyavasthaarth kehete hai
 There is also work in it, system is also there, it is also real and it is also meaning sab milakar banate hai kaary vyavasthaarth yani samasya saakshaat
 The Government of Rajasthan has issued the order on 21 October
 aadesh jari karne vaali sanstha kaa naam he ayuktalay college shiksha, rajasthan, jaipur
 The entire chart is made in this order
 bataaya gaya he ki kis college se teacher ko kis college main 15 din ke liye bheja jayega
 According to this order, two teachers will be sent alternately for 15 days in a teacher-less college
 donon par zimmedaari hogi ki 30 dinon ke bheetar paathyakram puraa karne kaa prayaas karenge
 Only after informing the principal will he leave for his native college
 30 dinon main course puraa karne ke liye 279 shikshakon kaa chayan kiya gaya he
 Can two teachers together complete any course in 30 days? Churan is being sold openly to make India a world guru
 ye idia chuuran hi he kyonki 30 din main paathyakram puraa karne ke kamaal kii ummid bharat ke hi shikshakon se hi kii ja sakati he
 From where these teachers will be removed for 15-15 days, then the subject will stop
 isse rajasthan ke ek college main ek saal main course puraa hoga or ek saal main 30 din
 This is an amazing idea
 aap dekh rahe hai ragadrabari, college sarkari or chaatr tarkari
 But on this list, it was known that where there are zero teachers
 chaumahala rajkeey mahavidhyalay main bhugol kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is no Sanskrit teacher in Manoharathana Government College
 manoharthana mahavidhyalay main samajashaastra main bhi koi teacher nahin he
 Khanpur Government College has zero teachers in History, Geography, Sociology
 samasya kaa samaadhaan yahi hoga ki shikshakon kii sthaayee niyukti kii jaae
 Till exportable teachers are not ready, then these vacant positions can be filled only by import
 is suchi main kai shaharon ke naam hai jinka uccharan tivi par nahin hota he
 Such as Khetri, Jhadoul, Kekri
 yahaan ke rajkeey collejon ke kai vishyon main zero teacher hai
 This list shows that there is a lot of emphasis on the posting of Sanskrit teachers in many colleges
 akhir sanskrit kaa apmaan, nahin sahegaa hindustan tip naare deevaaron par likhane se pehle kuch to karke dikhaanaa hi hoga
 Sanskrit teachers are being sent for 30 days
 jab teacher nahin the tab bhi sanskrit ke saath mazaaq ho rahaa tha, ab jah 30 din main course puraa karaane kaa prayaas karenge to yah mazaaq nahin, laughter chalange hoga
 It is written in the order that the fare to be paid will be paid
 15 din thaharne, khaane pine ke bare main aadesh spasht nahin he
 The status of guest teacher is not good
 15-15 dinon ke liye bheje jane kaa yah idia nayaa he kyonki pehle teen teen maheene ke liye shikshak bheje jate the to iske khilaaf shikshak court chale gaye or ste le aae
 To avoid this, a laughter challenge has come to complete the course in 15 days
 jafar multani ne madhya pradesh ke agar malwa se guest shikshakon kii ek samasya kii taraf dhyaan khinchne ke liye story bheji he
 You know that the guest teacher in Madhya Pradesh is called a guest scholar
 is hisaab se vahaan ke permanent teacher ko vidwaan samajha jaataa he yaa nahin, pataa nahin
 The guest as well as the scholar, will hear that they are more interested
 magar sabase zyaada shoshan inhen kaa hota he
 If you compile the terminology nomenclature used to hire teachers in colleges, then the entire book will be made
 yahaan ke shaskeey nehru mahavidhyalay main atithi vidwaan namita 70 kimi dur se padhaane aati he
 Namita has been a university topper
 kuch dinon pehle namita kaa utaras kii surgery hui thi
 The government rules that no guest scholar can take seven consecutive days off
 saat dinon se zyaada avkaash legaa to kaary mukt kar diya jayega yani hataa diya jayega
 Namita also traveled to surgery to save her job and kept coming to college
 vaise bhi jo selary milti he wo car ke petrol par hi karch ho jaati he
 Think about how much leave a female guest scholar will get when she becomes a mother
 hamane pataa kiya to bataaya gaya ki atithi vidwaan ko matternity live maatrutiv avkaash kii paatrata nahin he
 You did not feel fond of, did not engage in English, then it was not surprising in Hindi
 yahi nahin atithi vidwaan ke liye bhi zaruri he ki ve seminar main jaaen, paper pragent karen magar jab ve jate hai to vetan cat jaataa he
 When a permanent teacher goes, his salary is not deducted
 aapako iske peeche kaa tark samaj aayaa
 Now come to Mumbai University
 iske itihaas main pehali baar vaais chancelar ko barkhaast kiya gaya he
 Sanjay Deshmukh, who has got his name recorded in history, kept making history in some other cases
 artiai kaaryakarta anil galgali ne yah khulaasa kiya he ki sanjay deshmukh visi banane se pehle 2015 main elelbi kii pariksha main fail ho gaye the
 Even after this, he was made the VC of the University of 774 colleges
 times of india ne likhaa he ki ve aresas ke kareebi hai
 The RSS should distance itself from Sanjay Deshmukh as Anil Galgali has revealed that Sanjay Deshmukh has made record overseas trips during his tenure
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne bataaya ki unhone 100 karod kii fiks dipazit tod di
 It is also being learned that the Vice Chancellor had wanted to buy the plane with the money of the students
 hawaii jahaaz
 Our Vice Chancellors ruined the university but they will be the first who dreamed of buying a plane after the ruin
 agar yah sahi he to visi banane se pehle likhva lenaa chahie ki main niyukt karne vaale ke raajnneetik agenda ko chalaate hue uniwarsity ko jald se jald barbaad kar duungaa magar uske paise se hawaii jahaaz nahin kharidoongaa
 Heart beats telling this news
 jane kyon lag rahaa he ki aisa nahin hua hoga magar sohit mishra ne bataaya he ki sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz udaane hetu privet license ke liye applai bhi kiya
 i wish this news was wrong
 hawaii jahaaz kareedne ke saath ye udaana bhi chaahate the
 This is not true VC payalat kaa karcha bachaane kii sochi
 If the CBI, ED, by the work of fixing the opposition
 iskar vibhaag kuch ghante ke liye free ho to sanjay deshmukh se bhi mil aana chahie
 The opposition accuses these investigative agencies that they are behind them, not anyone else
 vaise big braking news yahi he ki vishvavidhyalay main aircraft kareedne kaa prastaav paas nahin hua
 The comments is bich dobaaraa kapi check karaane kii maang karne vaale chaatro ne maidan badal diya he
 Now they have come out of university grounds to Azad Maidan
 dobaaraa pariksha kii fees vruddhi se naaraaz hai
 The fee of Rs 500 has been increased to Rs 1050
 sochie sanjay deshmukh ne jahaaz kareed liya hota to gazab ho jaataa
 Children would run on the streets of Mumbai carrying banners and laughing while flying ships over VC sea
 yahuu yahuu karte rahe
 Students still perform
 sanvida par, theke par, anshkalik padhaane vaale teacher to pradarshan bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 We are teaching less than the minimum wage, we cannot get leave if we are ill, we are going to college in Bukhar, and you are killing us by making us laugh that we are going to become world gurus
 brake le lijie broken system kaa ek or namoona dikhaaungaa, bharat main krabian or shmashaan ko lekar sirf sampradayik raajnneeti hi nahin ho sakati he, logon ne sabit kar diya he ki ve is maamle main ghotaalaa bhi kar sakate hai
 SPA was formed in 1941
 yah desh kaa sabase purana or pratishthit santhaan he jahaan planning or architect kii padhai hoti he
 This college was established so that the students coming out of it will help in planning in the village, city and other areas
 kasbon kii planning kaa haal dekhakar aap nishcint ho sakate hai ki bharat main kabhi kisi ne architect or planning kii kabhi padhai hi nahin kii he
 In 2015, it was declared as an institution of national importance by passing legislation by the Parliament
 rashtriya mahatv ke is santhaan ke chaatr andolan ke mahatv ko bhi samajhate hai
 If you did not protest or participate in democracy, or did not join, then you did not live democracy
 haath main binar lekar chalanaa loktantr kaa sabase kuubasurat drishy he
 Without such scenes neither you become a citizen nor a human being
 binar par likhe ye shabd sirf naare nahin hai balki kavita hai
 By picking this up, when you are coming out of the class room to gather in a courtyard on the campus of the college, then you are freed from your inner fear and have prepared to pay the duty of speaking
 bolnaa khud ko behatar karnaa he
 These students of SPA have gathered here for the safety of fire
 samooh kii yah takat hi he jo prashasan ko vinamr banaati he
 After ignoring the first day, when the agitation went on the second day, the Dean of the college appeared
 chaatr dean se sawaal jawaab karne lage hai
 If you did not question, what did you live? espie dimd uniwarsity he
 1200 students study
 phir bhi yahaan ke hostel kii samasyaon kii suchi kaaphi lambii he
 One student said that water does not come clean in the hostel, due to which students buy bottles of water from outside
 ek chaatr pani par hazaar se pandrah sau rupee karch karata he
 The ceiling keeps falling apart
 chaatr bataate hai ki yahaan saanp bhi aate hai
 Monkeys and rats keep coming
 andolan karne vaale chaatro ne college kaa puraa bajet chaan maaraa he
 The notice board has been installed
 yah santhaan praathamikta suchi main hone ke baad bhi bajet kii katautee kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 In 2013-14, the budget provision of SPA was 45 crores but got 28 crores
 2014-15 main espie kaa bajet praavdhaan tha 46 karod magar mila 30 karod
 In 2015-16, the budget provision of SPA was 40 crores but got 26 crores
 aap dekh rahe hai ki kis tarah bajet kam mil rahaa he
 This is affecting the basic facilities here
 college main doctor hona chahie magar nahin he
 Medication is also not available
 girls hostel main ek floor par aath hi shauchalay hai jabaki saath chatraayen rahati hai
 According to him this is quite low
 espie ke chaatro ne bataaya ki safai kaa bura haal he
 During the movement, he cleaned and deposited this waste
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki campus main machharon kaa raaj he jisaki vajah se kai chaatro ko dengue ho chukaa he
 The junk of the old cooler is stored here
 vaise aap dilli ke mohallon main jaaiye puraani gaadiyaan or scooter kabad ke rup main jame hue hai
 There is no removal
 campus kaa haal bhi kuch aisa hi he
 SPA is deemed university
 yahaan bhi jitne shikshak hone chahie utane nahin hai
 Statistics show that there are fewer teachers than the sanctioned posts and the number of teachers is decreasing
 2014 main professor ke liye 32 pad manzur hai, 29 professor the
 From 2014 to 2016, this number decreased from 29 to 23
 2014 main associat professor ke 44 pad manzur the magar kaam kar rahe the 30
 There were 30 associate professors in 2014 and 31 in 2016, a decrease of 13
 skool of planning and architector main bhi shikshakon kii kami he
 Now let's go to Rajasthan
 yahaan ke system main ek shabd kaa istamaal hota he, kaary vyavasthaarth
 Work arrangement means that you teach in college a and there is no teacher in college B, then you will be sent to college b for three months
 magar college a ke teacher itane pareshaan ho gaye ki court se ste le aae
 So now a new method has been worked out
 lekturer ko 15 dinon ke liye kisi duusare college main bhejo
 This system is called work system
 isamen kaary bhi he, vyavastha bhi, yatharth bhi he or arthath bhi he
 All are made together, that is, the system of work ie problem
 rajasthan sarkaar ne 21 oktober ko aadesh jari kiya he
 The name of the organization that issued the order is Commissionerate College Education, Rajasthan, Jaipur
 is aadesh main puraa chart bana he
 It has been told that from which college the teacher will be sent to which college for 15 days
 is aadesh ke mutabik shikshakavihin college main do shikshak baari baari se 15-15 din ke liye bheje jaaenge
 Both will have responsibility to attempt to complete the course within 30 days
 isaki soochna principal ko dene ke baad hi apane mul college kii taraf prasthaan karenge
 279 teachers have been selected to complete the course in 30 days
 kya do teacher milakar 30 din main kisi bhi paathyakram ko puraa kar sakate he? bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran khuleam bechaa ja rahaa he
 This idea is the only one because it can be expected from the teachers of India that it is amazing to complete the course in 30 days
 jahaan se ye teacher 15-15 din ke liye hataae jaaenge vahaan to vishay tham jayega
 This will complete the course in one year in a college in Rajasthan and 30 days in a year
 kamaal kaa idia he na
 You are watching Ragdarbari, college government and students
 lekin is suchi yah to pataa chal gaya ki kahaan kahaan zero teacher hai
 There is no teacher of Geography in Chaumhala Government College
 manoharthana rajkeey mahavidhyalay main sanskrit kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is also no teacher in Sociology at Manorathana College
 khanpur rajkeey mahavidhyalay main itihaas, bhugol, samajashaastra main zero teacher hai
 The solution to the problem will be to make permanent appointment of teachers
 niryaat karne laayak shikshak taiyaar nahin hote hai tab tak aayaat se hi in khaali padon ko bharaa ja saktaa he
 This list has names of many cities that are not pronounced on TV
 jaise khetadi, jhaadol, kekadi
 There are zero teachers in many subjects of state colleges here
 is suchi se pataa chalata he ki kai collejon main sanskrit ke shikshakon kii padasthapana par khaasaa jor diya gaya he
 After all, Sanskrit will not be insulted, Hindustan type slogans have to be shown before doing anything on the walls
 30 din ke liye sanskrit ke shikshak bheje ja rahe hai
 Even when there were no teachers, i was having fun with Sanskrit, now when i try to complete the course in 30 days, it will be a laughter challenge, not a joke

 kya do teacher milakar 30 din main kisi bhi paathyakram ko puraa kar sakate he? bharat ko vishwa guru banane kaa chuuran khuleam bechaa ja rahaa he
 This idea is the only one because it can be expected from the teachers of India that it is amazing to complete the course in 30 days
 jahaan se ye teacher 15-15 din ke liye hataae jaaenge vahaan to vishay tham jayega
 This will complete the course in one year in a college in Rajasthan and 30 days in a year
 kamaal kaa idia he na
 You are watching Ragdarbari, college government and students
 lekin is suchi yah to pataa chal gaya ki kahaan kahaan zero teacher hai
 There is no teacher of Geography in Chaumhala Government College
 manoharthana rajkeey mahavidhyalay main sanskrit kaa koi teacher nahin he
 There is also no teacher in Sociology at Manorathana College
 khanpur rajkeey mahavidhyalay main itihaas, bhugol, samajashaastra main zero teacher hai
 The solution to the problem will be to make permanent appointment of teachers
 niryaat karne laayak shikshak taiyaar nahin hote hai tab tak aayaat se hi in khaali padon ko bharaa ja saktaa he
 This list has names of many cities that are not pronounced on TV
 jaise khetadi, jhaadol, kekadi
 There are zero teachers in many subjects of state colleges here
 is suchi se pataa chalata he ki kai collejon main sanskrit ke shikshakon kii padasthapana par khaasaa jor diya gaya he
 After all, Sanskrit will not be insulted, Hindustan type slogans have to be shown before doing anything on the walls
 30 din ke liye sanskrit ke shikshak bheje ja rahe hai
 Even when there were no teachers, i was having fun with Sanskrit, now when i try to complete the course in 30 days, it will be a laughter challenge, not a joke
 aadesh main likhaa he ki aane jane kaa kiraaya diya jayega
 The order regarding 15 days stay, food and drink is not clear
 guest teacher kii sthiti thik nahin he
 This idea of sending for 15-15 days is new because the teacher was sent for the first three months, then the teacher went to court and brought a stay against it
 lagata he isse bachane ke liye 15 din main course puraa karne kaa laughter chalange aayaa he
 Zafar Multani has sent a story from Agar Malwa in Madhya Pradesh to draw attention to a problem of guest teachers
 aap jaanate hai ki madhya pradesh main guest teacher ko atithi vidwaan kaha jaataa he
 According to this, whether the permanent teacher there is considered a scholar or not is not known
 atithi bhi or vidwaan bhi, sunakar lagegaa ki zyaada khatiradaari inhen kii hoti he
 But these are the most exploited
 collejon main shikshakon ko theke par rakhane kii jo shabdaawalee namavali kaa prayog hua he, uskaa sankalan karenge to puri ek kitaab ban jaaegi
 Guest scholar Namita comes to teach at the Government Nehru College here from 70 km away
 namita uniwarsity topper rahi hai
 Namita had Uterus surgery a few days ago
 sarkaar kaa niyam he ki koi bhi atithi vidwaan lagaataar saat dinon kaa avkaash nahin le saktaa he
 If you take more than seven days off, then the work will be freed, ie will be removed
 namita naukari bachaane ke liye surgery kii hilat main bhi safar karti raheen or college aati rahi
 Anyway, the salary you get is spent on the petrol of the car itself
 aap sochie mahila atithi vidwaan ko maa banane par kitni chuttee milti hogi
 When we found out, it was told that the guest scholar does not qualify for maternity leave maternity leave
 aapako shauking nahin laga, angrezi main nahin laga to kya hindi main hairaani nahin hui
 Not only this, it is also important for the guest scholar to go to seminar, present the paper, but the salary is deducted when they go
 permanent teacher jate hai to unka vetan nahin katataa he
 You understand the reasoning behind this

 If this is true, then before writing a VC one should write that i will ruin the university as soon as possible by running the political agenda of the appointee but will not buy the plane with his money
 is khabar ko bataate hue dil dhadak rahaa he
 Know why it may not have happened, but Sohit Mishra has told that Sanjay Deshmukh has also applied for a private license to fly the ship

 ab ve uniwarsity ke maidan se nikal kar azaad maidan aa gaye hai
 Again annoyed with the increase in examination fees
