 At present, the government is considering setting up an inquiry into the matter

 com / cq45kyvva8— BJP (@ bjp4india) September 13, 2018 Modi said that the talk of the grand alliance today is a reflection of the strength of BJP and BJP workers
 congress aaj kuch dalon kaa sahyog jutaney main lagi hui he jabaki madhyapradesh ke apane mahadhiveshan main usne kaha tha ki vah kisi ke saath samjhauta nahin karegi
 He said why is it needed now
 mahagathbandhan kii avadharana par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki ve dalon ko jod rahen he or ham sava sau karod dilon ko jod rahe he
 In this nexus the policy is unclear, there is confusion in leadership and intentions are corrupt
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa se dar ke kaaran ve mahagabandhan ke khel main lage hai jinka ekmaatr naaraa ‘modi hataao’ he or bhaajapa kaa ek hi sankalp he ‘desh ko aage badhaao
 Modi said that if the BJP had done something wrong then the Grand Alliance would not have been required, but the BJP government has done a lot of work, in that case the opposition is engaged in fighting on the basis of lies instead of fighting on issues
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha, ‘‘ ve namdaar he, ham kaamadaar hai
 Their aim is the welfare of a family, our goal is nation building
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa virdohi kii kamajori par nahin balki sava sau karod logon kii takat par chalati he

 Rahul said, "their (BJP) is thinking, as long as the woman is silent, nothing is said, then the woman is fine
" jaise hi mahila ne munh kholaa, usko chup karwaao
 "it is noteworthy that women are not given membership in bjp's mother organization RSS, but a separate organization has been created for women

 The BJP has attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, describing the bomb blasts at the 'hunkar Rally' in Patna as an attack on the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 bijepi ne nitish kumaar ke is daawey ko galat bataaya ki rajya sarkaar ko aise kisi aatanki hamale kii koi khufia chetavanee nahin mili thi
 It also raised the demand to investigate who is behind this conspiracy
 rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh arun jetali ne somvaar ko kaha, 'bihar ke mukhyamantri or police adhikariyon ne daawa kiya he ki unhen aatanki hamale ke sambandh main koi khufia chetavanee nahin mili thi

 ' unhone kaha ki khufia beuro (ibi) ne 1 aktubar ko bihar ke police mahanideshak sahit vibhinn rajyon ko likhe patr main chetavanee jari kii thi ki indian mujahidin kuch shaharon par hamale kii yojana bana rahaa he
 According to him, 'on October 23, the IB specifically warned the Bihar Police that Indian Mujahideen terrorists could be targeted by Narendra Modi's Patna rally
 'jetali ne kaha ki khufia chetavanee milane ke baavjood nitish sarkaar ne modi raily kii suraksha vyavastha ko lekar samvedanheen, laaparvaah or udasin ravaiya apanaaya
 Jaitley has demanded that the serial blasts at Modi's rally on Sunday be investigated as to who is behind them
 gandhi maidan or uske aas-paas hue in visphoton main chah log maare gaye or anek ghayal hue hai
 He said that this investigation is also necessary so that the omissions in Patna are not repeated elsewhere
 unhone kaha, 'aaj modi kii raily main aisa hua he, kal pradhanmantri kii raily main ho saktaa he isliye ehtiyaati kadam uthaanaa jaruri he
 He said that after the rally started, there was an explosion in Gandhi Maidan
 aisa hone par party ko salaah di gai ki raily ke kaarykram ko aage nahin badhaayaa jaae
 But by doing this, a mob of millions of people gathered there could have caused a stampede
 isliye party ne jokhim uthaate hue kaarykram ko jari rakhane kaa nirnay kiya
 He told that the news of bomb blast did not reach the people, for this purpose, a deliberate announcement was made from the platform that people should not give up firecrackers
 jetali ne kaha, 'hamaara bhagya bahut acha tha ki yah baat kaam kar gai or logon ko bam visphot kaa andeh nahin hokar yahi laga ki kisi ne pataakhe chode hai
 It did not lead to a stampede-like situation, otherwise it would have been difficult to imagine the untoward if it had happened in such a huge crowd
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki ‘hunkaar raily’ main ravivaar ko hue serial visphot desh kii 'kamjor suraksha sthiti' kaa saboot he
 This sends a message that any terrorist can carry out such incidents wherever he wants
 unhone kaha ki aane vaale dinon main kuch vidhansabhaon tathaa uske baad loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar raajnneetik gatividhiyaan or tej hongi
 In such a situation, the central and state governments should prepare themselves for a better security environment

 hoicourt kaa aadesh kanoon kaa tamaasha or gaiyrkanoonee he
 The acquittal of Jayalalitha has resulted in the defeat of the law, so the order of the Karnataka High Court should be stayed
 supreme court me karnataka sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki hoicourt ne aay se adhik sampatti maamle main jayalalita kii sampatti kaa galat akalan kiya he
 If the assessment of the High Court is accepted, then the additional assets from income stand at Rs
 14 38 lakh 93 thousand 645 which is 41% more
 yah unki sampatti kaa 8
 12 percent is not
 aise main is aadhaar par aropiyon ko bari karnaa sahi nahin he
 Stating full assessment of Jayalalithaa's assets, the Supreme Court said that there was a mistake in totaling the assets from the High Court

 12 per cent has been increased, while it is 76 on the total assessment of assets
 70 fisadi atirikt baithti he
 If the accused has accepted the construction of the construction in the court, then this expense together with their total income is 93
 60 fisadi atirikt sampatti ho jaati he
 Thus it is proved that Jayalalithaa's assessment of the property has been wrong with the High Court
 supreme court main is maamle kii agali sunwaayee buudhvaar ko hogi
 In the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had asked Jai Lalitha's counsel in the case to file his witnesses and documents related to this case before the court before the next hearing
 darasal aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main special court ne jaya or teen anya ko chaar saal kii sajaa or 100 karod kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 Due to this, he lost the chief minister's chair in September 2014, but in May last year, he was acquitted by the Karnataka High Court and said that if the income is ten per cent higher then it cannot be considered a crime
 iske baad ve phir se mukhyamantri bani thi
 a petition was filed in the Supreme Court against the Karnataka High Court's decision to acquit Jayalalithaa
 hoicourt ke faisle par karnataka sarkaar or diemke ne supreme court main yachika dekar kaha gaya tha ki hycourt ne aay se adhik sampatti kaa galat aankalan kiya he

 ) a sensational case of ragging has been reported at Allahabad Chemotilal nehrumedical College
 senior chaatro ne embibies pratham varsh main daakhila lene vaale chaatro ko pehle din sir mundwakar or sir jhukaakar line se college main pravesh karne kii ijaajat di
 Not only this, the girls were told to come by applying oil to their hair and making them snug
 seniors ke adeshon ko maanate hue ye chaatr pehle din sir mudaakar college aae to kai ladkiyaan juda baandhakar ai
 Please tell that no student was formally complained about this ragging, but after the picture went viral in the media, Allahabad DM took cognizance of itself and ordered an inquiry
 ye maamla guuruuvaar ko charchaa main tab aayaa jab sir mundaye darjanon chaatro kii tasviir viral ho gai, ye sabhi chaatr ek saath ek qatari main elahabaad ke motilal nehrumedical kalegemen ghus rahe the
 Senior students of the medical college have been accused of ragging junior students
 senior chaatro ne junior kai chaatro kaa sar mundava diya or chaatraon ko yah farmaan suna diya ki chatraayen college main baalo main tel lagaakar or juda karke aaengi
 Now these aggrieved students are neither speaking to anyone nor complaining to anyone
 raging kii ye baat saamne aane ke baad dm ne isaki jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 In this regard, neither any student nor the college administration is speaking on camera
 haalanki elahabaad ke jila adhikari suhas elvai ne jaankaree milane ke baad ek jaanch cameti taiyaar kar jaanch ke aadesh de die hai
 The district official said that as soon as information has been received in this regard
 is puure prakaran par jaanch ke liye team gathit kar di gai he, jisamen esadm ke netritv sambandhit aria ke sio or prashasan ke kuch anya adhikariyon ke saath maamle kii jaanch karenge
 The District Magistrate also said that at present, it is the responsibility of the college administration, but so far no complaint has been made in this case
 isiilie khud se sangyaan lete hue jaanch ke liye team gathit kar di he
 Imran Khan, former Pakistan cricket captain and the head of tehreek-e-insaf, gave candid replies from indo-pak relations to cricket till today
 haalanki aatank ke sawaal par imran ne kashmir raag alapa
 On the question of action on Hafiz Saeed, Imran said that we cannot hold anyone on the orders of India
 padhein imran khan se puri baatcheet
 On the new attempts to negotiate in India and Pakistan
 
 No one can say how far this conversation will go
 pehle bhi baat aage tak badi he lekin phir kuch na kuch ho jaataa he
 i pray that mutual relations between the two countries are better
 baatcheet aage bade isaki jimmedaari donon hi taraf ke netritv par he
 Their vision will decide how far the conversation will proceed
 jab bhi bharat ne dosti kaa haath badhaayaa tab vahaan se gole chale
 
 
 Here people may think so, but in Pakistan it is believed that peace cannot be established until Kashmir is discussed and a solution is not reached
 manmohan daur ke samay kii baatcheet kaa kram badhaayaa janaa chahie?donon mulk main thode se log hai jo nahin chaahate ki donon deshon ke sambandh behatar hon
 But Avam wants a better relationship on both sides
 yah sab netritv kii kami he
 If there is a slight interruption during the conversation, then it is wise to stop the whole process
 paak aatankwaad par lagaam lagane ke bajaae kashmir raag kyon alaapta he?aatankwadabhi kashmir se judaa masalaa he
 a solution to the Kashmir problem is also necessary to end terrorism
 agar donon taraf ke netaa apane awam ko yah samajhane main safal hon ki sambandh behatar hone se donon desh tarakkee karenge to baatcheet safal ho sakati he
 To end poverty, it is also necessary to start trade between the two countries
 bharat ne paak ko most faverd nesan kaa darja diya lekin padosi kaa ravaiya ulta rahaa haidekhie seemaa ke donon taraf alag-alag kism kii dharanaen hai
 What is the need for the leaders of the two countries to meet quietly
 unhen apane logon ko samajhane kii jarurat he ki rishta behatar hone se kya phayda hoga
 The biggest problem of both countries is poverty
 ham chaahate hai ki bharat ke saath vyapaar shuru ho
 More than half of the people in Pakistan are poor
 aap haal hi main PM modi kii aalochana karte rahete hai
 
 jis tarah kaa janadesh modi ko mila unase apekshaayen bad jaati hai
 Modi should change his policies after the mandate
 jaise vaajapeyi ne kiya tha
 When Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Prime Minister, there was an atmosphere of fear in Pakistan as to what will happen now
 lekin unhone dosti kaa haath badhaayaa
 At that time i believe that it was Pakistan's fault for failing the talks
 kya sena kaa dabaav he behatar rishton kii raah main sabase bada roda?rahil sharif pakistani fouj ke pramukh hai
 According to the Army Chief, the military's policies change
 sharif pakistan main kaaphi lokapriy hai
 Have fought rigorously against terrorists
 pichley saal peshawar ke army skool main us barbar aatanki hamale ke baad unhone bina koi bhedbhaav barte sabhi aatankiyon ke khilaaf morcha kholaa he
 Things have become much better now
 hafiz said jaise log rojaanaa bharat ke khilaaf aag ugal rahe hai, kai aatanki sanghathan pakistan main rah kar bharat ke khilaaf yuddhe chede hue hai un par to koi karrwai nahin hui?ham bharat ke hukum par kisi ko bhi giraftaar nahin kar sakate
 If someone has to prove the culprit, then he has to present the evidence
 sharif ne pehali baar un logon par karrwai kii jin par koi haath nahin daalata tha
 If i were the Prime Minister, i would have talked to him, see what kind of poverty there is in the country, in such a situation, we should insist on increasing trade
 jahaan takahafiz saidki baat he to dekhie kisi ko giraftaar karne se pehle uske khilaaf saboot jutaney hote hai
 There should be a cricket series between Pakistan and India? puri duniya ke log iskaa intjaar karte hai
 i have played cricket myself, so i know that both countries will earn from this on both boards
 na hona julm hahar pakistani mumbai atake kii ninda karata he
 Your ex-wife Reham Khan said in an interview that Imran wanted me to just stay at home and make chapattis
 is par aapaki kaaphi aalochana bhi hui
 i said in that interview that Reham is a working woman and i think the best thing about him is that he worked and raised children too
 wo ek majboot aurat hai
 Obviously, it is not possible that i loved this about them at first, then later i would force them to stay at home
 jab kisi kaa bhi talaak hota he to vah ek nijee traasadee hoti he
 Human being breaks down
 main is masale par or koi baat nahin karnaa chahta

 Since childhood, i have always felt more comfortable and bonding with my father
 aisa nahin tha ki mummy mujhe pyaar nahin karti thim lekin papa ke saath jo dil kaa conection tha wo mummy ke saath kabhi nahin ban paaya
 Yes, we can say that daughters are more attached to fathers
 papa ek aisa shabd jisamen shaayad duniya kii sari takat samaai he, jinke paas apane bachche kii har uljhan kaa jawaab he joduniya kii har pareshanise ladakar aapaki khushi ko banaae rakhte hai wo papa hi to hai
 i have never felt since childhood that if i say anything to my father, i will get scolded
 papa hameshaa se mere saath-saath chale or main kah sakati hum ki mere is safar ko suhana banane ke liye unhone har tarah se meraa saath diya
 Today, when i have become fit for marriage (as the society feels), i do not stand my test
 aisa kyon he pataa nahin par main bas ye chaahati hum ki meraa humsafar mere papa jaisaa ho samajhadaar, kering or mere har achche-bure main mere saath khadaa rahane vaala
 Even in the matter of marriage, my father never told me anything so that you do what you like
 kitna acha lagata he na papa ke saath aisa dostana hona
 But perhaps many people may find these things in my film because not everyone would have seen such a form of father
 kadak mizaaj, samay ke paband or khamosh rahane vaale papa vaali chhavi aaj bhi hamaare samaaj ke ek bade hisse main dekhne ko mil jaaegi
 No one tried to know why the father had such a nature, but yes, everyone questioned his behavior
 har papa pyaar se bhare hue hai bilukal maa ke mamata bhare dil kii tarah, bas ham hi unke us mulaayam se ehsaas ko chune kii koshish nahin karte
 Let's know, how to make your relationship with father strong and friendly
 
 
 1
 Spend a lot of time with my father
 When i was younger, i used to wait for Papa to come from office like every child does and they started making a big bang
 papa ke saath bitaayaa har pal meri jindagi kaa sabase best lamhaa he
 If your father is a little quiet and bitter then spend a lot of time with him and make him feel his presence
 yakeen maniye aap jald hi unke saath apane rishte main badlaav mahasoos karenge
 2
 har baat karen unase shairmujhe aisa koi vakya yaad nahin jab main apana koi sikret mummy se share kiya ho kyonki papa ke kaan main dhire se apni baat kahana mujhe bahut acha lagata tha
 When i started sharing my problems with my father, life always seemed settled
 mere papa mere best bady ban gaye hameshaa ke liye
 Therefore, you should also make your father your diary where every written word will be safe
 unke saath unke stregal ke dinon kii baaten karen sach maniye aapako jindagi ke sabase bade leashan vahiin se seekhney ko milenge
 3
 unhen unke khaas hone kaa ehsaas dilaayenmujhe lagata he ki papa ko ye kahana ki main aapse bahut pyaar karti yaa karata hum duniya kaa sabase kathin kaam hota he
 This happens because we have not made such a comfort zone with my father that we can talk to him with love or make him feel special
 isliye ab seadat daalen ki har khaas maukaper yaa bemauke bin baat hi papa ko ye unke khaas hone kaa ehsaas karaayenge
 Keeping these few things in mind, if we manage to maintain the most important relationship in life, then it will be easy to say anything to my father
 kyonki ek pita ke liye uske bacchon kii khushi se zyada kuch mahatvapurn nahin hota
 Watch some such videos here which are becoming very viral on social media on Father's Day
 kyonki har papa main ek hero chipa he or asal jindagi ke hero to vahiin hai
 
 
 Only a father can make the future of his children with all the sufferings of life

 ) a fortnight ago on January 20, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad Yadav announced that Jitan Ram Manjhi would continue to be the Chief Minister of Bihar
 unhone in atakalon par viraam laga diya tha ki rajya ke satta shikhar se is mahadalit netaa ko jald hi hataa diya jayega
 But now Lalu's attitude has changed
 ve kah rahe hai ki maanjhi kaa mukhyamantri bane rahanaa yaa na bane rahanaa jediu kaa aantarik maamla he or isliye nitish kumaar iskaa faisla karenge or vah faisla le liya gaya he
 What is the story? The change in Lalu's attitude towards Manjhi amid informal discussions about the leadership change in the state was the strongest indication that the curtain could soon fall on Manjhi's tenure as Chief Minister
 pichley hafte dilli main jediu ke adhyaksh sharad yadav ke saath lalu kii alag se baatcheet hui thi
 This conversation is being attributed to the change in his attitude
 mana gaya ki sharad ne lalu ko samajhayaa ki maanjhi ke mukhyamantri bane rahane par oktober-november main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko nuksaan hi hoga
 The way Lalu has slowly removed his hand from Manjhi's back, it also indicates what is going on in the state's socialist alliance and where things are going
 lalu ke saamne do hi vikalp the: yaa to ve swabhaav se naram maanjhi ko or chah maheene shikhar par bane rahane den or chunaav ke baad satta main lautne kii koi ummid nahin rakhen yaa phir swatantra vichaaron vaale nitish kumaar ko abhi mukhyamantri banaaen, rajya main sushasan sthapit karen or phir chunaav main jitkar dobaaraa satta main lautne kii ummid karen
 Putting the reins of the government in Manjhi's hands for some more time could mean closing the road ahead for the lalu-nitish alliance in the state
 chunaav par nigaah rakhte hue lalu ne behatar sambhaavnaaon ko aajamaane kaa faisla kiya
 Both Nitish and Lalu are now dependent on each other to save their slippery political ground from the attack of the BJP
 june 2013 main bijepi se rishta tuutane baad jediu kii sarkaar baagiyon ke bhitarghaat se apane ko bachaakar tiki rahi, to yah lalu ke samarthan se hi mumkin ho sakaa he
 Similarly, despite losing five consecutive elections after the 2005 assembly elections, if Lalu is confident about his political future, it is due to the cooperation of Nitish Kumar
 isi ne rajya ke siyaasi centre main lautne kii lalu kii ummiido ko jinda rakhaa he
 While making Manjhi the chief minister, it was decided that he would continue in the post till the assembly elections, but the elections would be fought under Nitish's leadership
 lekin jab mana gaya ki maanjhi sushasan nahin de paa rahe hai or ise lekar party ke bheetar bechaini badaae lagi, tab jediu ne apni ranneeti badalane kaa faisla kiya
 The party, which is countering bjp's aggressive growth, does not want to take any risk
 jediu ke ek mantri kehete hai, 'yadi aglaa chunaav nitish ke netritv main hi ladaa janaa he, to behatar hoga ki ve maanjhi kii jagah le len
 There is a possibility that a part of Mahadalit votes may go against JDU if Manjhi is removed
 bijepi bhi apni rotiyaan senkane se baj nahin aegi
 She may try to raise Manjhi as an oppressed Mahadalit leader
 'maanjhi ke siyaasi mansoobon ko lekar argedy or jediu ke kuch hisson main gaharaa shaq kiya ja rahaa tha
 When nitish-lalu was busy making his quarrel a future strategy, Manjhi was creating uneasiness in the alliance by sometimes praising Narendra Modi and sometimes advocating making Dalit chief minister in the state
 vaise jediu netaaon ne dalit mukhyamantri kii daleel par sawaal khadey nahin kiye, par lalu ne maanjhi kii baat ko yah kahkar khaarij kar diya ki sirf janata hi tay karegi ki aglaa mukhyamantri koun hoga?pehle hi ho gaya tha faislalalu ko bharose main lene ke baad jediu jaahir taur par bahut aasaan or nirvighn netritv parivartan chahta he
 According to party sources, Sharad Yadav may have already spoken to Manjhi to step down to make Nitish the chief minister
 maanjhi ne 4 farvari ko sharad se mulaakaat kii thi
 However, as an alternative plan, the leaders of both parties were trying to anticipate the potential loss in the event of Manjhi taking a rebellious stand
 alabatta maanjhi netritv kii baat maanakar apane pad ko chhodane ke liye taiyaar dikhaai nahin die
 His supporters blame Nitish supporters for denying that he promised to let Manjhi run the government till the assembly elections
 4 farvari ko nitish ne jab party ke loksabhaa ummidavaaron ko apane nivas par sambodhit kiya, to maanjhi us baithak main nahin gaye
 Manjhi contested the Lok Sabha elections from Gaya and lost
 is naate unase bhi us baithak main maujuud hone kii ummid kii ja rahi thi
 Apparently he did not go there and expressed his opposition
 jediu ke pradesh adhyaksh basishtha narayan singh ne haal hi main kaha tha ki maanjhi or unke mantriyon ke bich sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa
 He also suggested that Manjhi should settle with his cabinet colleagues
 yah is baat kaa ishaara tha ki unki sarkaar kaa moolyankan karte hue party maanjhi kii hi galati maanati he
 a day before Narayan's statement, Manjhi said that he himself was not satisfied with the functioning of his cabinet minister Lalan Singh
 unhone isi vajah se sadak nirmaan vibhaag ke sachiv kaa tabadalaa karne kii baat bhi kahi thi
 Earlier two ministers Lallan Singh and P
K
 ke
 Shahi had written a letter to the Chief Secretary, questioning the mode of transfer of IAS officers
 is chitthee ke baad bhi maanjhi ke ziddee ravaie main badlaav nahin aayaa or unhone daleel di ki afasaron kaa tabadalaa karne kaa unhen puraa adhikaar he
 The crack in Manjhi's government had deepened
 kai mantri mukhyamantri ke khilaaf virodh darj karne main hichkicha nahin rahe the
 Only four ministers arrived at the Chief Minister's Republic Day meet
 isse pehle khaadya or upabhokta sangrakshan mantri shyaam rajak ne apni ore se di daavat main maanjhi or unke vafaadaaron ko jhidakate hue sirf nitish ke kareebi mantriyon ko hi bulaayaa tha
 When Manjhi joined Cooperative Minister Jai Kumar Singh's feast in January, about a dozen of his ministers sat in separate rooms and did not even come out to pray with Manjhi
 party ke ek andruni shaks ne kuch din pehle bataaya tha, 'jab party kaa har padaadhikari nitish se mukhyamantri ke taur par lautne kii guzarish karata he, to ve sirf muskaraa dete hai
 JDU president Sharad Yadav was also present at the meeting held at Nitish's residence
 unhone bhi maanjhi ke bhavishya ke bare main kuch kehane se yah kahkar inkaar kar diya tha, 'yah phaltu sawaal he, mujhe kuch nahin kahana he
 'by the time he said this, perhaps the decision had already been taken! bayaanbaji joro par he
 Some are saying that make everyone a Hindu, while some are saying that people are born as Muslims
 silsilaa tham nahin rahaa
 On the contrary, there is increasing crowd in the meetings of leaders spewing poison on both sides
 lekin chintaa kii baat muslim samudaay ko lekar he
 Disputes arising from the statements have been causing the most harm to this community and are going to cause harm
 ab ek najar muslim netritv par
 The Muslim leadership has to say this because every Muslim leader's first step of progress is his religion
 or vah jis party main he, use yah bharosa dilaakar aage badha he ki vah musalamaanon ke vot dilavaayega
 Muslim vote bank
 aisi guarantee koi hindu netaa nahin de paata
 Not even a saint
 kyonki inaki koi sunata hi nahin
 Apart from this politics, the most serious thing which is associated with Muslim community is fundamentalism and shipping
 20 saal se adhik umr ke sirf 3
 Only 6 percent of Muslims are graduates
 jabaki deshbhar kaa yah ausat 6
 Is 7 percent
 muslim mahilaayein kisi anya dharm kii mahilaon main sabase zyada ashikshit hai
 One out of every two women is illiterate
 yahi nahin desh main musalamaanon kii ek badi pareshaani he aabaadi
 Since independence, it has continued to grow, while Hindus have been decreasing
 muslim 9
 14 percent from 9 percent
 2 pratishat ho gaye, jabaki usee daur main hindu 85 pratishat se ghatakar 79
 6 percent
 ab yadi sakshi maharaj kahen ki hindu mahilaon ko chaar-chaar bachche paidaa karne chahie, to ve hansi kaa paatr ban rahe hai
 But this trend continues seriously in the Muslim community in large part of the country
 2005-06 main hue neshnal family health survey ke mutabik 45
 Only 7% of Muslim couples are using the means of family planning
 haa, kerala apwaad he, jahaan kaa muslim samudaay padhaa-likhaa he
 But neither does any Muslim leader have a lot of debate on these issues and if he does, then who will come to listen to him
 saansad asadauddin ovaisi kehete hai ki ek muslim usee seat se chunaav lard saktaa he, jahaan 30 fisadi se zyada muslim hon
 Otherwise it is impossible to win it
 doosraa koi unhen vot degaa hi nahin
 This argument of Owaisi makes it clear again that vote bank politics is the compulsion of Muslim leaders
 or majahabi baaten karne se usamen nikhaar hi aata he

 wo ye bhi kehete hai ki ipisi ne unheen khilaadiyon ko ijazat di he jinke license (esadmes yani sports data management sarvice) bane hue hai
 Padmashree Devendra wants that Indian athletes should get an exemption on this issue too

 Not only India, the importance of power in the whole world is self-evident and its forms of worship are different
 samast shaktiyon kaa kendra ekmaatr paramatma he parantu vah bhi apni shakti ke bina adhuraa he

 kyon shakti kii maa rup main puja hoti he?shakti se taatpary he urja yadi urja ko apane anusaar chalaanaa he to us par aadhipaty karnaa padegaa matlab yaa to shakti ko haraakar yaa to shakti ko jitkar use ham apane paradheen kar sakate hai
 But this was not possible with the public, so in India, to get all the grace from him, the word mother was quoted
 isse shakti main vatsalya bhav jaagrath ho jaataa he or adhuri puja va jaap se bhi maa krupa kar detii he
 Therefore, entire Vedic literature and Indian spiritual power have often been worshiped as mother
 yahi nahin shakti ke tamsik roopon main hakini, yakshini, pretini aadi kii puja bhi tantric or sadhak maa ke rup main karte hai
 The word mother reduces her aggression and she shows her kindness by forgiving the person as son and ignorant

 (from input language) (input bhashaa se) On the initiative of the Supreme Court for out-of-court settlement on the Ram temple case, all parties have to give their opinion
 is bich court ne maamle par turant sunwaayee se inkaar kiya he
 Earlier in the hearing, the country's top court had asked all the parties to find a solution through mutual dialogue, describing it as a matter related to religion and faith
 yahaan tak ki court ne jarurat padane par madhyasthata kii peshkash bhi kii thi
 The court gave a week's time
 ab adaalat sulah kii koshishon ke liye or samay dene ke paksh main he
 With this initiative of the court, the whole country has been hopeful for early resolution of this sensitive case which has been going on for decades
 lekin kitni gunjaaish he is maamle main court se baahar sulah kii:kya kehete hai pakshakaar?ayodhya maamle kaa ek sabase bada pahalu he ki is maamle ko lekar desh main jitna bhi vivaad uthaa ho lekin ayodhya main kabhi dange nahin hue
 All the parties of this matter say that it is possible to resolve it peacefully, just do not spoil the environment outside
 hanumangadhi mandir ke mahant gyaandas ne kaha ki subramanyam swami ne ram mandir maamle ko ulajhaa diya he
 There should be a peaceful resolution of the matter with the consent of all and in the arbitration of the court
 donon paksh isapar sahamat ho sakate hai
 At the same time, the other party Iqbal Ansari says that Ram temple and mosque can be constructed in the premises itself
 hoicourt ne isi aadhaar par faisla sunaaya tha
 There should not be attempts to create new political disputes in this matter
 baatcheet se maamle kaa hal nikal saktaa he
 What 4 terms are stuck on? After the Supreme Court's comment on the out-of-court settlement on the issue of Ram temple in Ayodhya, Aaj Tak took the initiative
 aaj tak ne donon pakshakaron se is maamle par baat kii or mudde ke samaadhaan ko lekar unki raay ko saamne laane kii koshish kii
 Both Hindu and Muslim parties said that the central government should talk to both the parties separately on this matter
 pakshakaron ne is mudde ko sulajhane ke liye kai bate rakhin jinamein chaar sharten saamne ain-shart 1- usee 2
 Ram temple-mosque built on 7 acres of land
 shart 2- shart- pahal aage badhaane ke liye centre numaayinde bheje
 Condition 3- People who raise controversy like Subramanian Swamy and Haji Mahboob stay away
 shart 4- ayodhya main donon pakshakaar ek saath baithen
 Whom the parties are assuming: Just before the crucial hearing of the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid land dispute in the Supreme Court, the main party in this case, Iqbal Ansari, son of the late Hashim Ansari and the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, took up the matter in the Supreme Court on behalf of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy Strongly opposed going
 donon ne supreme court ke register general ko khat likhakar shikaayat kii he
 The complaint states that Subramanian Swamy is not a party to the case, he has nothing to do with the case, he had petitioned the court to become a party in this matter, on which many parties objected
 ikbaal ansaari or vakf board ke mutabik adaalat ne abhi tak swami ko paksh banane ke bare main koi faisla nahin liya he
 But in spite of this, on March 21, Swami raised this matter in the Supreme Court for early hearing without informing the real parties of the case
 sulah kii 9 koshishen ho chuki hai vifalaisa nahin he ki is maamle main sulah kii ye pehali koshish he
 This has been done 9 times before and attempts have been made from the level of Prime Minister
 -babari masjid or ram mandir ko lekar sulah kii pehali koshish 1859 main hui thi
 After the riots between Hindus and Muslims, the British officers tried to end the case by sitting responsible people on both sides and divided the disputed area into two parts by fencing
 lekin isse hal nahin niklaa
 In 1949, the namaz ceased to be recited after the idols were placed in the Babri Masjid
 -1992 main babari vidhwans ke baad deshbhar main dange hue
 a commission was set up during the time of PV Narasimha Rao as Prime Minister, there were attempts to negotiate from both sides but the talks did not reach a conclusion
 -atal bihari vaajapeyi ne bhi kii sulah kii koshish apane kaarykaal ke dauraan kii
 Vajpayee also talked to both the parties about this but he was not able to bring both the parties on one platform for agreements
 -31 may 2016 ko bhi vivaad ko lekar hashim ansaari or mahant narendra giri ke bich baithak tay hui thi lekin hashim ansaari kaa isse pehle kii intkaal ho gaya or ye baithak phir kabhi naa hui
 What was the Allahabad High Court verdict? In 2010, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, while giving the verdict in the Janmabhoomi dispute, ordered the land to be divided among the three parties
 hoicourt ne jameen ko ramalala virajman, nirmohi akhaada or sunni vakf board main baraabar baraabar baantne kaa aadesh diya tha
 All the parties have filed appeals in the Supreme Court against the High Court's decision which has been pending for the last six years
 68 saal kaa safarnama1528: daawa kiya jaataa he ki ayodhya main babari masjid kaa nirmaan hua
 1949: Lord Rama's idol is secretly kept in Babri Masjid
 daawa kiya gaya ki bhagwaan ram kaa yahi janm hua tha
 After this, claims emerged that the Babri Masjid was built by removing the temple
 1984: mandir nirmaan ke liye ek cameti kaa gathan kiya gaya
 1986: The disputed site was opened to devotees
 isi saal 1986 main hi babari masjid cameti kaa gathan kiya gaya
 1990: Lal Krishna Advani started a nationwide Rath Yatra
 saal 1991 main rathyatra kaa paayda bijepi ko hua or wo upi kii satta main aa gai
 Bricks were sent from all over the country to build the temple
 1992: 6 disambar ke din hajaaron kii sankhya main sevakon ne ayodhya pahunchakar babari masjid dhaha diya, jiske baad sampradayik dange hue
 1992: An inquiry commission is formed under the chairmanship of Justice Liberhan
 1993: is ayog ne jaanch shuru kii
 2002: Hundreds of devotees gather at the disputed site
 hoicourt ke eesai ko is baat kii jaanch karne ke liye kaha gaya ki 1528 main pehle vahaan masjid thi yaa nahin
 2003: ASI states that there is evidence of temple relics
 2009: librehan ayog ne apni report saunpi
 2010: The High Court ruled to divide the disputed site into three parts
 2011: supreme court nen hoicourt ke faisle par ste laga diya
 What is the way forward? The Supreme Court gave both the parties an opportunity to find a middle ground through mutual reconciliation and said that if the matter does not come up, the court will give its verdict
 ab baatcheet ko aage badhaane kaa daaromadar centre kii modi sarkaar or upi kii yogi sarkaar par he
 The BJP has hoped to resolve the matter through talks and said that the Ram temple will be built by removing the deadlock
 congress ne ise samaadhaan kaa bada mauka bataaya he
 But there was a ruckus on BJP leader Subramanian Swamy's statement that the mosque should be built across the Sarayu
 saath hi ki agar mandir mudde par sahmati nahin banati he to 2018 main jab rajyasabha main bhi bijepi kaa bahumat hoga to kanoon banaaya jayega
 It has to be seen that the issue of Ram temple in the midst of politics rises, even when the country's top court is in favor of reconciliation
 kya aapane kabhi kisi tote ko bhangada kii dhun par dil kholkar naachte hue dekha he? nahin naa? ham aapako ek aisa tota dikhaa rahe hai, jo jabardast bhangada karata he or uske steps to karnaa bahut mushkil he
 Bhangra of this parrot is probably better than all of us
 in dinon is tote kaa bhangada soshal netwarking cites par viral ho gaya he
 In the video, the parrot is sitting comfortably at first, but as soon as the Punjabi song is played from behind, he starts dancing
 jaise hi gaanaa teji pakadta he, tota apane pankhons se bhangada ke steps ko bhi tej kar detaa he
 So watch this video and laugh: bade parade ke sabase badbhole abhinayta kahe jane vaale vivek oberoi phir se bachchan katha baanchane ko taiyaar hai
 It happened that Ramgopal Varma showed parts of his latest film, Rakta Charitra, to Abhishek Bachchan
 or chote bachchan ne twitor par film kii tarif karke vivek ko aisa mauka de diya jise chukne kii galati ve kabhi nahin kar sakate
 As a result, he told his friends very proudly how Abhishek was shocked to see his acting in the film while Abhishek did not say anything
 kisi ne sahi kaha ki agar khuda na khaasta raamu ne yahi kaam aishwarya raay ke saath (haalanki ve shaayad hi iske liye raji hotin) kiya hota, to vivek to jamkar dance karte
 Overall both are happy
 jai ho vivek ji kii! Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's old demand is that Bihar should be given special status
 ab isi ko lekar argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne nitish ko patr likhaa he
 Regarding the neglect of Bihar in the general budget, Tejashwi Yadav has said in his letter that the present Bihar government is confusing people by saying that having the same coalition government at the center and the state will speed up development but nothing like this Used to be
 mukhyamantri ko likhe patr main tejasvi ne kaha he ki vartmaan rajya sarkaar ke anusaar rajya main dabl ingine kii sarkaar he lekin is nai sarkaar ke gathan ke baad ab tak siriepraadh kii ghatnaonko hi dabl ingine mila he
 Tejashwi said that the Center and the state government were unable to form any coordination for any unknown reasons
 gathbandhan main pisi janatatejasvi ne kaha ki gathbandhan main bhaajapa or jadyu ke netaa ek duusare par raajnneetik varchasv sthapit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai or is manshaa ke bich bihar kii janata pis rahi he
 Tejashwi accused Nitish that despite forming a government with the BJP, he could not get anything from the central government to Bihar, neither special state status, nor special package nor the amount in the name of flood relief
 tejasvi ne kaha ki 2015 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan nitish kumaar bihar kii janata ko apni sabhaaon main pradhanmantri kii vaadakhilaphi kii recording sunaaya karte the lekin ab bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar bana lene ke baad nitish kumaar ko chahie tha ki vah anusaar 15-15 lakh rupye sabhi logon ke khate main dalava den
 Why not take a rights rally? Taking a dig at Nitish, Tejashwi Yadav wrote in his letter that he had organized a rights rally to get the status of a special state to Bihar but now why should he organize a rights rally to enter Bihar's special state Not doing it? Tejashwi told Nitish Kumar that he should muster up courage and raised voice against what Bihar has overlooked in the general budget Minister must
 tejasvi ne kaha ki agar vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ke nitish kumaar asafal rahete hai to bihar kii janata yah jaan jaaegi kii vishesh rajya kii maang karnaa unka raajnneeti saadhane kaa ek kaalpanik daawa or sirf jumala tha
 Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the chief patron of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), has made an absurd statement
 unhone bharat ko chetavanee dete hue kaha he ki kashmir pakistan kaa hissaa he or wo ise hasil karke rahenge
 He said that he will not give even an inch of Kashmir to India
 purv pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani ke awaas se party kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue bilaval ne kaha, 'main puraa kashmir waapas luungaa
 i will not leave even an inch of this for India because Kashmir belongs only to Pakistan
 pakistan ke baaki provins kii tarah kashmir bhi hamaara he
 On September 15, Bilawal announced that he would be a candidate from his mother's traditional seat NA-207 in the 2018 general election
 khabaron ke mutabik, pakistan pipuls party (pipipi) ke mukhya sangrakshak, bilaval ne pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitiai) or pakistan avami taharik (pieti) dwaara islamabad main yojit dharne kii bhi aalochana kii thi
 Bilawal, son of former President Asif Ali Zardari, called the strike a prejudice and called the protests frivolous
 bilaval ne kaha tha ki agar media is andolan ko dikhaanaa band kar de to ve dharna band kar denge
 Bilawal also rejected the talk of partition of Sindh province
 unhone kaha tha ki sindh praant ke bantwaare kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta or sindh praant kii tulana punjab se karnaa thik nahin hoga
 The Muttahida Qaumi Movement Party demanded the partition of Sindh province
 jis seat se bilaval ne chunaav ladane kii ghoshnaa kii he, use pipipi kaa garh mana jaataa he
