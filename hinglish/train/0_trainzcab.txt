 ’ Welcome Home Abhinandan: Wing Commander Abhinandan Vardhaman (abhinandan Varthaman) of the Indian Air Force (IAF Pilot) has returned to his homeland after spending nearly 60 hours on Pakistani soil amidst ongoing tension between India and Pakistan
 shuukravaar ko dinabhar ke intjaar or pakistan kii chalbaaji ke jaddojahad ke baad aakhirkaar kareeb 9 bajkar 16 minute par vayusena ke jabanj payalat abhinandan pakistan se bhartiya sarajameen par laute
 The hours before his return were full of doubt
 kuch samay nahin aa rahaa tha ki aakhirkaar pakistan commander abhinandan (abhinandan Varthaman) kii vaapasi karaane main itnaa vilamb kyon kar rahaa he
 Due to frequent changes in time, many times Indians were suspicious of the intentions of Pakistan
 wing commander abhinandan raat 9 bajkar 10 minute par pakistan kii ore wagha checkpost par dikhe or unke saath pakistani ranger, islamabad main ucchayog main bhartiya air atashe maujuud the
 He was wearing a dark coat and khaki colored pants
 garv se sir ooncha kiye wing commander abhinandan (abhinandan) ne pakistan se get paar karke bharat main pravesh kiya
 Abhinandan's return created a festive atmosphere in the country and everyone spoke in unison on the return of Abhinandan - a hearty welcome to Abhinandan on his return to the country
 to chaliye jaanate hai ki aakhir abhinandan kii vaapasi prakriya ke dauraan shuukravaar ko kya-kya hua
 
 
 Abhinandan, a wing commander who showed indomitable gallantry during the violation of Indian air range by Pakistani planes on 27 February, returned home from Pakistan on Friday night
 unki vaapasi se pehle ke kuch ghante sanshay se bhare rahe
 The move is seen as an important step towards easing tensions arising out of India's response to Pakistan's continued support of terrorism
 darasal, shuukravaar ko pakistan wing commander abhinandan ko bharat ko saunpane vaala tha
 For this, complete preparations had been made by India
 vayusena ke adhikari, bhartiya duutavas ke adhikari or sarkaar ke pratinidhi sabhi samay par taiyaar the, magar pakistan kii chalbaasiyon ne dopaher se raat kar diya
 It was earlier told by Pakistan that he would release Abhinandan between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but he repeatedly delayed
 iske peeche kai vajahen bataayin ja rahi hai
 For example, he wanted to bring the incident to Lime Light
 vah chahta tha ki puri duniya kii najar is khabar par ho
 Around three o'clock in the evening, Abhinandan was flown from Rawalpindi to Lahore
 magar lahore se wagha border laane main usne itani der laga di, jisase uske napak iraade bhi sabase saamne jaahir ho gaye
 According to sources, Abhinandan was detained in an army camp located in Lahore and Pakistan forcibly made a video of Abhinandan
 yah baat bhi sahi he ki pakistan or bharat ke bich dastavej kii prakriya main bhi kuch samay kii deree hui, magar yah deree itani bhi nahin thi ki abhinandan kii vaapasi main dopaher se raat ho jaae
 According to information received from sources, the delay in handing the Indian pilot Abhinandan to India was because the Pakistani authorities asked him to record the statement on camera
 iske baad hi unhen seemaa paar karke swadesh jane diya gaya
 Apart from this, issues related to documents also became a reason for delay
 sutron ne bataaya ki pakistan ne unki rihaai kaa samay do baar taal diya
 Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar Shiv Dular Singh Dhillon told that the brave pilot is happy to return to his country
 yah puche jane par ki abhinandan ne swadesh lautne par adhikariyon se kya kaha, upayukta ne kaha ki vah pehle muskuraae or bole, 'main apane desh waapas lautakar khush hum
 He was handed over to BSF officers after some formalities at the Wagah Attari border
 baad main vayusena ke adhikari apane saath abhinandan ko lekar aae
 The wing commander was then taken from the Attari border to Amritsar in an Air Force vehicle
 is dauraan punjab police kii gaadiyaan unke vaahan ke saath chal rahi thim
 After this Vardhman was brought to Delhi by air
 iske baad unhen sena ke aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan unki shaareerik jaanch kii jaaegi
 Wing Commander Abhinandan entered the Pakistan border while chasing the Pakistani Air Force fighter plane at around 10 am on 27 February
 pakistan ke epa-16 ko maar giraane ke baad abhinandan kaa vimaan bhi krash ho gaya
 Because of this he had to get off with the help of parachute somehow
 jab vah neeche aae tab unhen ehsaas nahin tha ki vah dushman desh kii dharti par ja pahunche he
 Some people came to him, whom Abhinandan asked where he was
 is par kuch pakistaniyon ne chalbaaji dikhaate hue unase kaha ki aap bharat kii dhanti par hai
 But Abhinandan had some doubts
 iske baad vah bharat mata kii jai ke naare lagaae
 After this, Pakistanis surrounded them again
 abhinandan kisi tarah khud ko bachaane ke liye vahaan se bhaage
 He was later taken into custody by the Pakistani Army
 sena ne unase poochtacha kii, magar abhinandan ne utana hi munh kholaa, jitna unhen bataane kii ijaajat hoti he vayusena main
 After this, he was also served tea and coffee by the Pakistani Army
 uske baad phir imran khan kii ghoshnaa ke baad duniya ko pataa chalaa ki vah mahaj do din ke baad hi vatan waapas ho jaaenge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while welcoming Abhinandan's return, said in the tweet, 'wing Commander Abhinandan, welcome to your home
 raashtra ko aapke adamya saahas par garv he
 Our armed forces are a source of inspiration for the 130 crore Indians of the country
 ' wing commander abhinandan kii swadesh vaapasi par puure desh kii nigahen wagha border par din bhar lagi rahi
 Not only this, Wing Commander Abhinandan was congratulated by many political leaders including Rahul Gandhi and tweeted on his return
 vaayu sena adhikari abhinandan vardhman ke pakistan kii hiraasat se mukt hokar lautne ke bich baari sankhya main mediakarmiyon kii najar is par thi or puure desh ke log tivi set par takataki lagaaye hue the
 People gathered at the checkpost near Attari Bagha border with tricolor since morning
 unamem se anek apana cheharaa tirange ke rang se range the or wing commander abhinandan kii surakshit vaapasi ke samarthan main naare bhi laga rahe the or jashn kaa maahaul tha
 Significantly, the Indian Air Force targeted the jaish-e-mohammed hideouts in the Pakistani border
 uske baad pakistani vaayu sena kii ore se bharat kii vaayu seemaa kaa ulanghan kiya gaya or is dauraan hue hawaii sangharsh main pakistan kaa ek epa
 
 16 vimaan gira diya gaya evam bharat kaa mig 21 durghatnagrast ho gaya
 As a result of this conflict, the parachute of Wing Commander Abhinandan surged across the border and he was captured by Pakistan on 27 February
 pakistani pradhanmantri imran khan ne apni sansad main kaha tha ki vah shanti ke sandesh ke taur par bhartiya payalat ko reeha kar rahe hai
 He called the move a peace gesture
 wing commander abhinandan raat 9 bajkar 10 minute par pakistan kii ore wagha checkpost par dikhe or unke saath pakistani ranger, islamabad main ucchayog main bhartiya air atashe maujuud the
 He was wearing a dark coat and khaki colored pants
 garv se sir ooncha kiye wing commander abhinandan kaidi desh pakistan se get paar karke swadesh bharat laute
 Air Marshal RG Kapur said that Abhinandan, an Air Force pilot, has just been handed over to us
 unhone kaha ki ham unhen waapas paakar khush hai
 He said that the pilot would be taken for detailed medical examination as he had to go through moments of great stress
 videsh mantralay ne kaha ki wing commander abhinandan ko wagha ataari border par bhartiya adhikariyon ko saunp diya gaya
 In fact, on 26 February, in order to avenge the Pulwama terror attack, India attacked the terrorist bases of Jaish, which were on the Pakistani soil
 bhartiya vayusena ne mangalvaar subah pakistan ke balakot main jaish e mohammad ke aatanki shivi par bam giraae the or kareeb 300 aatankiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar diya tha
 During this time India used about 12 Mirage fighter jets and rained 1000 kg bombs
 iske baad pakistan kii baukhalaahat saamne aane lagi or usne bharat ke daawey ko khaarij karne kii koshish kii
 Tensions between the two countries have escalated since India's airstrike over terrorist targets

 Now the next chapter of the Ayodhya case will be started in the Supreme Court, the Ayodhya case will be filed by December 9
 The members of the petition bench will decide whether to hear again or not, the next chapter of the Ayodhya case has started in the Supreme Court
 ab rivyuu yani punarikshan yachika yani arji najar-e-sani kaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 The first petition has come from Jamiat ulema-e-hind
 ol india muslim personal lau board kii ore se mukadmaa lard rahe yachikakartaon kii orgiyaan aani hai
 The period for filing the petitions is 9 December
 kyonki faisla aane ke 30 dinon ke bheetar punarvichaar yachikaayen daakhil kii ja sakati hai
 Reconsideration Petition procedurenow talk about the procedure after filing petitions? According to the legal process, the bench which hears the petition also considers the review petition
 kyonki usee peeth ke jajon ko mukademe ke har mode, har tark or daleelon kii jaankaree hoti he
 Justice Ranjan Gogoi, one of the five judges' bench hearing the Ayodhya case, has retired
 lekin isi bench kaa hissaa rahe justise sharad arvind bobade ab mukhya nyaayadhish hai
 Therefore, they have the privilege to include one more person in the bench so that quorum can be fulfilled
 peeth ke jajon kii taadaad puri paanch hone ke baad kanoonee prakriya apni raftaar main aati he
 That is, after this, the law is that all the reconsideration petitions are distributed to the five judges of the bench
 sabhi unka adhyayan kar lete hai
 After this, they have a meeting in the Chamber
 meeting main yachika yaa yachikaaon kii merit par charchaa hoti he
 If all the judges of the bench feel that yes, the questions raised in the petition which need to be considered again, then the hearing of the case is open in court
 varanaa yachika chember hearing main hi dam tod detii he
 Only news comes out - No Merit Found
 
 Review Petition Disseminated
 itihaas or recordsupreme court main rivyuu petishan ke nateezon ke itihaas or record par nigaah daalen to 99
 99% of the review petitions die in the Chamber itself
 un par khuli adaalat main sunwaayee hoti hi nahin
 Now what can happen in this case? It can also cause dysmorphic hearing in the chamber
 rafel or sabarimala kii tarah bada maamla hone kii vajah se khuli adaalat main is par sunwaayee bhi ho sakati he
 What could be the reasoning behind the plea of the petition during the chamber hearing is that the five judges of the bench had given an opinion
 lihaaja isamen badlaav yaa paltaav kii gunjaaish bahut kam he
 Had the decision come in the ratio of three-two or four-one, it would have been more likely to be heard in open court
 khuli adaalat main isaki sunwaayee ke peeche ye tark he ki chunki maamla itihaas, samskruti, saamaajik taane bane ke saath-saath siyasat se bhi judaa he
 Therefore, the review petitions filed in this deeply influential case can also be heard in open court, so that any future doubt regarding this decision may not spread the rumor or wrong message
 yani sadiyon tak misaal banane ke kram main is faisle main bhi kaha jaae ki adaalat ne sabhi ko aakhri mauka tak muhaiyaa karaayaa
 Last chance is available
 Now as far as constitutional rights are concerned, after the review petition is rejected, the option of filing a curative petition is also open
 jaahir he aakhri kshan tak maidan main date rahane vaale ladaiya iskaa bhi istemaal jarur karnaa chahenge
 The court will also want that even after centuries, no one can raise a finger on the verdict and the judiciary that the court unilaterally rejected our review petition without giving us a chance to argue
 adaalat ko ye sandesh bhi dena he ki nyaaypalika kisi dabaav yaa prabhaav main kaam nahin karti
 In every situation, he is free, fair and free
 uske faisle tarkon or sabooton par aadhaarit hote hai naa ki sirf khyaal yaa yakeen par

 In the last five days, two hundred and fifty cows have come and died in this cowshed
 gaushala main mar rahi gaayon par sarkaar kaa kahana he ki baahar se pakadakar laai ja rahi gaayen hin mar rahi hai
 These cows keep eating plastic, so the public is responsible for this, while the cowherds say that the cows are dying due to the negligence of the government
 is bich congress ne guuruuvaar se shuru ho rahe vidhansabha satr main hingoniyagaushalaka maamla uthaane kaa elaan kiya he
 Surprisingly, Rajasthan is the first state to impose the Go tax and the state government has raised about 100 crores from this tax till now
 lekin sarkaar ne abtak ek paisa bhi is fund se kharch nahin kiya gaya he
 In the last five days, 258 cows have died in Gawinghonia Gaushala
 sutron ke anusaar gaushala main pichley teen maheene main gaayon kii sthiti itani kharaab ho gai thim ki gaayon ko doctor bachaa nahin paa rahe hai
 They have been infected by living in mud marshes for a long time without eating and drinking
 jabaki rajasthan sarkaar ke go paalan mantri otaraam devasi kaa daawa he ki hingonia darasal kanji house he jahaan par aawaara gaayen pakad kar laai jaati hai
 In such a situation, cows eating polythene become very ill and die

 Rajasthan is the first state where Gopal tax is levied
 rajasthan sarkaar ke khajaane main is tex se abtak ek saal main 100 karod rupee aa chuke hai magar inamen se ek bhi paisa kharch nahin hua he, kyonki tex to vitt vibhaag sambhalata he jisaki mantri khud mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje hai
 The Chief Secretary has held three meetings for how to use Go Tax, but no decision has been made so far
 
 
 
 That is why plastics are eating Gaiengopalak saint Manhat Gopaldas says that the government is eating the land of cows, so cows are eating plastic
 sarkaar ko gaushala santon ko saunpna chahie
 Meanwhile, there is also a great politics in the state regarding the cow
 guruuvar se shuru ho rahe vidhansabha satr main congress ne gaay or garib ko mudda banaakar hangaamaa karne kaa elaan pehle hi kar diya he
 Former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot says that Congress will expose bjp's double standards about cow and poor
 rajasthan sarkaar ke liye gaayon kii mauton par jawaab dena aasaan nahin he
 The opposition is also making a point about the fact that the Chief Minister, who had said that she would go to Hingonia Gaushala after four days, had not yet gone
 udhar sarkaar ne adhikariyon ko kaha he ki kisi bhi keemat par gaayon kii mauton ke aankade kam karen
 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav was unfazed by the revelations about his property

 pichley 40 dinon se darjan bhar press conference kar bijepi ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne lalu prasad yadav kii tikat yaa mantri banane ko lekar jameen or makaan lene kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Sushil Modi has revealed the assets of Lalu's family worth around Rs 1500 crore
 modi kaa kahana he ki lalu prasad yadav ko jald hi pataa chal jaayegaa ki muft main log unhen jameen or sampati kyon dete hai
 When ED and CBI investigate this
 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav ne aakhirkaar apni chuppi todi or kaha ki bijepi apane virdohi netaaon ko jabardastee nishaanaa bana rahi he
 According to him, there is no disturbance in his property, as well as he has given all information to the Election Commission

 He said that if the vine is cooked then what happens to the crow's father
 koun jameen mujhe saste main diya kisi ko iske kya matlab he
 People make the farm a farm house
 susheel modi ne lalu par benami companiyon ke jariye paise banane ke aarope lagaae hai
 Apart from Lalu, other members of his family have also made serious allegations against Sushil Modi
 maamla mal kii jameen kii mitti se shuru hua tha jo tikat or mantri banane ke evaj main jameen or makaan likhaane tak gaya
 Sushil Modi made revelations about the land, house disclosure of Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav in Delhi and recently Lalu's elder daughter and Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharati land
 mani laundrig main jail main band jain bandhuon se lalu ke rishte kaa khulaasa bhi kiya gaya
 Modi says that when the CBI and ED investigate these cases, it will be known who owns the land
 lalu prasad yadav ne daawa kiya ki mishael naam kii koi company hi nahin he
 However, when asked about the property, Lalu Prasad Yadav was also seen many times
 lekin bijepi ke netaa susheel kumaar modi ke mutabik unke paas pukhta saboot hai unhone kendra or rajya sarkaron se kaha ki is maamle kii jaanch kar uchit karrwai kii jaae

 The Sessions Court of Pune has sentenced the three convicts of kidnapping, gang rape and murder to death
 teenon ke naam yogesh raaoot, mahesh thakur or vishwaas kadam hai
 The matter was being debated in the court since morning
 doshiyon kii taraf se dayaa kii daleel di gai thi, lekin adaalat ne kaha ki inke aparaadh kshamaa ke laayak nahi hai
 The brutality by which the culprits carried out the crime falls in the rarest of the rare category, so all three are entitled to capital punishment

 maamle main 4 aaropee giraftaar kiye gaye the, jinamein se ek baad main sarkari gavaah ban gaya
 According to the police, Pune software engineer Nayana Pujari was standing at the bus stop in Kharadi on 8 August 2009 on her way home from office that a man named Yogesh Raut lured her Indica car into leaving the house
 yogesh ne nayana ko bataaya tha ki wo usee taraf ja rahaa he, isliye ghar tak chhod degaa
 
 
 But he took Nayana to a deserted place in the forest and called her friends
 baad main aropiyon ne nayana ke saath samuhik balaatkaar kiya phir odhani se uskaa galaa ghontkar hatya kar di
 The dead bodies were not recognized, so the assassins had also stained the face with stones
 kareeb maheene bhar kii koshish ke baad police ne yogesh raut, mahesh thakur, vishwaas kadam or rajesh choudhary ko giraftaar kar liya
 An accused later became a government witness
 saat saal baad adaalat ne yogesh raut, mahesh thakur or vishwaas kadam ko apharan, balaatkaar, hatya or sajeesh karne kaa doshi qaraar diya he
 But Nayana's husband says that such incidents are increasing in the country, so the death penalty to the culprits will be the right justice

 Rejecting criticism of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan's 'make in India' program, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Monday that it is associated with manufacturing good quality products at low prices and it is not relevant that it is sold in India Or abroad
 jetali ne kaha, mek in india ke tahat utpaada bhartiya upabhoktaaon ke liye banaae jate hai yaa baahar ke upabhoktaaon ke liye, yah praasangik nahin hai
 Today's theory is that consumers around the world prefer products that are cheap and of good quality

 Jaitley said that the taxation system should be tailored to the rest of the world, because when people buy products, they do not like to buy them with tax
 unhone kaha ki jab tak ham parivartankaree kadam nahin uthaate, vinirmaan chunauti bana rahegaa
 Jaitley said the only reason for the slowdown in manufacturing in recent times is the high cost of capital

 Party President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi were also present at the meeting of the most powerful Congress Working Committee of party leaders
 daftar ke baahar kii nautanki or bheetar ke naatak main kuch khaas fark nahin tha
 The motive of both was to save Rahul

 He said, "resignation is not the solution

 Meanwhile, Rahul was writing something on paper, staring at his cellphone

 Senior Congress leader Ajit Jogi, who lost the Lok Sabha elections from Mahasamund in Chhattisgarh, immediately turned it down
 unke baad anya sadasyon ne bhi isi raah par chalate hue is par charchaa karne se bhi inkaar kar diya
 The result of the two-hour discussion was that Sonia was entrusted with the responsibility of changing the party structure

 Rajya Sabha MP Vayalar Ravi said, "sonia and Rahul should remain in the leadership as they can keep this party united
" ’’ agar kisi party ko ekajute rahane ke liye netaa kii jarurat he, to phir uske liye khoi hui jameen waapas paane kii sambhaavna bahut kam dikhaai detii he
 The Congress wants to rely on Rahul for its future, but the big question is, will the party have any relevance if they remain in their hands? a senior Congress leader, on the condition of anonymity, said, "if they cannot move forward, they should at least walk away for some time
" ’’naakaam netacongress ke kai netaaon kaa maananaa he ki ab samay aa gaya he ki rahul ko har naakaami ke liye inam dena band kiya jaae or party unke bina bhi jeene kii aadat daale

 The moment for Rahul to change everything came in 2009, when the Congress regained power and Manmohan Singh asked him to join the cabinet
 rahul aage aa sakate the or prashasnic anubhav hasil kar sakate the, lekin unki dilchaspee sirf satta main thi, uski jimmedaariyon main bilkul nahin
 At that time he made an excuse to work for the party

 In May 2011, he supported the farmers' agitation in bhatta-parsaul village in Uttar Pradesh and in August the same year spoke in favor of the Lokpal Bill in Parliament
 2012 main uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main unhone bada jor lagaaya or gum-ghumkar jor-shor se prachaar kiya
 But in the 403-member assembly, the party's seats increased by only 6 and increased from 22 to 28
 unhone jimmedaari apane sir lee, lekin congress ne ek nahin suni
 In December 2012, when the entire Delhi was on the road after the December 16 gang rape, Rahul was so oblivious to India that he refused to meet the crowd
 tabhi jor-shor se naaraa laga, ‘‘saare yuva yahaan hai, rahul gandhi kahaan hai
 His image, being raised as a young face, gained tremendous momentum as he was not present on the streets during the Battle of Justice
 uske baavjood party netaaon ne janvari, 2013 main unhen congress kaa upaadhyaksh bana diya
 Rahul accepted the new role with much fanfare and the Congressmen felt that everything would change now

 He conducted several rounds of meetings with the state Congress units and changed the structure of the organization on his own

 As he said in his CII speech in April 2013 that India is a bee hive or an elephant? At Vigyan Bhawan in Delhi last October, Rahul said that according to him, it is necessary to understand the migration velocity of Jupiter to get an idea of the rise of Dalits? As Rahul pointed out in Allahabad in August 2013, is poverty a burden, a threat or just a "mental state"? The peculiar things Rahul repeatedly said in his speeches were blamed on his ideological advisors

 Some people like Jagdambika Pal, former president of Uttar Pradesh Congress, joined the BJP in dismay

 After defeating four state assembly elections in December 2013, Rahul named Ashok Tanwar as state president in the name of developing new leadership
 loksabhaa ke nateezon main rajya main party kaa vot bank puri tarah khatm ho gaya
 The vote share declined from 42 to 20 percent to 22 percent as compared to the 2009 election and the number of seats was reduced to 1 against 9

 prithviraj kaa rajya main koi janaadhar nahin he or unke netritv main vaapasi kii koi sambhaavna najar bhi nahin aati he
 Ashok Chavan has won the Lok Sabha elections from Nanded, but given the CBI probe into the scam, he seems unlikely to get any major role

 Despite forming the government last year in a state like Karnataka, the party's seats could not increase

 National Conference leader Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah has also raised the issue of his party's alliance with the Congress
 ek televijan intervyuu main unhone kaha, ‘‘congress or neshnal conference main kai netaa yah gathbandhan khatm karnaa chaahate hai, philhal main nahin kah saktaa ki iskaa bhavishya kya hoga
 "some Congress leaders also hold Rahul responsible for Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Ram Vilas Paswan's entry into the NDA
 paswan gathjod ke bare main baat karne ke liye janvari main do baar sonia or rahul donon se mili the
 "till the last moment, Rahul could not decide with whom Lalu Yadav and Ram Vilas or Nitish Kumar should be aligned," said a senior party leader

 Rajasthan Congress President Sachin Pilot says, "useless people should be thrown out immediately

 "but they are silent on the question of what the party will do to Rahul, who could not become the leader that India expected of him and the Congress needed
" isse yah sawaal bhi uthta he ki party ke varisht netaaon ne chunaav se pehle parivaar ke saamne yah baat kyon nahin rakhi or rakhi thi, to kya unki salaah ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya?jab sab naakaam ho jate hai, to aam taur par gandhi parivaar hi party ko sankat se ubaarataa he
 According to party general secretary Digvijay Singh, "the Congress has been brought up by the nehru-gandhi family

 trailor saamne aane ke baad milijuli pratikriya soshal media par mil rahi he
 Let's know how the trailer of the film is
 
 
 trailor kii teen khubiyaan or teen kamiyaan1
 Kangana's voice: Kangana Ranaut is a great actress, so expectations are higher than her
 manikarnika ke avatar main actress ko dekhakar to ye lagata he ki kirdaar main dam he, lekin unke dialog sunne ke baad ye nahin lagata ki kirdaar jaandaar he
 In period drama films, voice always plays an important role
 vaise is baat kaa khyaal trailor main kahin-kahin rakhaa gaya he, jo saaf pataa chalata he
 The character of Rani Laxmibai is a challenge for Kangana, as she is a character who has heard stories of sacrifice and bravery by every child
 aise main kangana ke kirdaar kii kamiyaan teen minute ke trailor main saaf najar aa rahi hai
 2
 becoground mujeec:period drama film main becoground mujeec kaa role sabase ahm hota he
 This thing is clearly seen by the viewers of many films released in the past
 mahaj trailor dekhakar kangana kii film kii tulana kisi duusari film se nahin kii ja sakati
 But the lack of weak background music is seen in front of the film's action scene
 3
 Dialogues of the film: The trailer of the film "manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi" has many excellent dialogues
 lekin ye samvaad aawaaj kii vajah se bakhubi darshakon ke dil tak nahin pahunch pate hai
 Where Kangana's voice is technically improvised, those dialogues are good
 lekin yuddh kaa udghosh karti rani kii dabi aawaaj ko sunanaa puure seen ke sikvence ko tod detaa he
 Best points of the film: 1
 ection seen:kangana ke id-gird likhi gai script main sabase bada part he ection
 Kangana has tried her best to teach it
 reports ke mutabik kangana ne sabhi ection seen ko real dikhaane kii vajah se talawaabaji sikhi
 He shot the scenes himself despite being dangerous
 kangana kaa shandaar kaam ection seen main dekha ja saktaa he
 2
 film kii kahani:manikarnika kaa trailor dekhakar wo sari kahaniyaan jeevant ho jaati he, jo bachapan se ham jhaansi kii rani ko lekar sunate aae hai
 How a queen put her life to save her kingdom
 lekin jhaansi kii rani ke jivan ke kai aise pahalu hai jinke bare main aaj bhi aam shaks gaharaai se nahin jaanata
 By watching the trailer, it can be guessed that many different aspects of the life of Rani of Jhansi have been shown
 jaise unki yuva avasthaa, kaise manikarnika naam kii ladki bani jhaansi kii rani, ye sari chijen dikhaai detii hai
 The character of Laxmibai's life as Premika, who is a mother as well as the queen who saves her kingdom
 aise kai pahalu trailor main najar aae hai

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator The feeling of love is beautiful, the harder it is to express it
 ladke to phir bhi saaf jaakar bol dete hai lekin ladkiyaan itani sahajata se apni bhaawanaaon ko jaahir nahin kar paati hai
 But if there is some whispering between the two of you friends and you like it but you cannot understand what is on his mind, then notice these 5 things in his behavior
 aapaki safalataa se vah khush hotihiapaki har baat ko, chaahe vah doston se judi ho, ghar se yaa kisi baat par aap apni raay jaahir kar rahe hon, aapaki baat ko vah bahut dhyaan se sunati he

 saf ali khan or amrutha singh kii beti sara ali khan ke bollywood debyue ko lekar bahut si khabaren aati rahati hai
 Much is written about this
 kabhi khabar aati he ki wo karan johar kii film 'student of da year 2' se bollywood main kadam rakhengi to kabhi ye reports aati hai ki wo rithik roshan ke oposit film main najar aaengi
 However, nothing was confirmed yet
 lekin india today se baatcheet ke dauraan diarector abhishek kapur ne khud conform kiya he ki sara unki aane vaali film 'kedarnath' main sushant singh rajput ke saath debyue karne vaali hai
 Will Saif's daughter pair up with Shah Rukh's son? a while back it was reported that Karan Johar has signed up Sara for his film
 kuch dinon pehle hui karan kii berthde party main sara dikhi bhi thim
 Sarah may not have made an entry in Bollywood yet, but she is seen posing with Bollywood's big stars from now on
 karan kii party main tashan main pahunchin jahnavi or sara, kiskaa luk bestbata den ki sushant sihan rajput ne bhi apane filmi kariyar kii shuruyaat abhishek kapur kii 'kaai po che' se hi kii thi
 Some time back Saif's father Saif Ali Khan said in an interview, 'karan Johar launches newcomers very well
 mere hisaab se wo sara ke liye best hai
 He is a very good and intelligent filmmaker
 unhen cinema kii bahut acchhee samaj he
 ' uttar pradesh main musalamaanon kii raajnneeti karne ke liye ek nayaa avatar aa gaya he
 These are Asaduddin Owaisi, President of All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM)
 hyderabad se loksabhaa sadsy asadauddin ovaisi ko raajnneeti apane pita salauddin ovaisi se viraasat main mili he
 The AIMIM, once confined to Hyderabad, has recently won two seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and has stepped on the political ground
 ovaisi kii nazar ab sabase zyaada muslim aabaadi vaale rajya uttar pradesh par he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party, which asserts Muslim votes, is upset with Owaisi's call
 sabase zyaada pareshaan hai sapa netaa aazam khan
 Azam Khan is considered the Muslim face of the state in SP
 sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav bhi aazam khan ko bahut maanate hai
 His place in government is considered to be second
 kai maamalon main wo super siem kii bhoomika main bhi nazar aate hai
 Azam Khan, who considers himself the greatest leader of the Muslims of the state, is well aware of Owaisi's ability and skill
 ve sapa main to muslim netaaon ke kad ko apane se ooncha hone se rokte rahe lekin owesi ko kaise rokenge, samaj nahin aa rahaa
 This is the reason why Owaisi was not allowed to hold a meeting in Azamgarh
 aazam khan ko is baat kaa ahsaas he ki ovaisi ke upi main aa jane se muslim samaaj main unki ahmiyat kam ho sakati he
 However, other Muslim leaders have been opposing this thinking of Azam even before in UP
 rajyasabha sadsy rahe patrkaar shahid siddiki isaki sabase badi misaal hai
 Siddiqui, a journalist's association with the profession, never liked Azam Khan
 mauka milte hi aazam ne unhen party se baahar kara diya
 Actually, Shahid had interviewed Narendra Modi for his newspaper
 lekin ovaisi to ek duusare raajnneetik dal se aate hai jo khud muslimon kii awaz uthaane vaala dal kehalaata he
 In such a situation, Azam Khan may now be forced to devise a new strategy
 2017 main rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 All political parties are preparing for this
 samaajawaadee party pehle se hi bijepi or modi ke badhate prabhaav se pareshaan thi, us par ovaisi ke upi main aane se unki dikkaton main izapha ho gaya he
 The number of Muslim voters in Uttar Pradesh is very high
 inhi voton kii vajah se 2012 main samaajawaadee party ne bahumat se zyada siten hasil kar upi main satta hasil kii thi
 The promises made by the SP to Muslim voters in the elections are not yet fulfilled
 muslim voter pehle hi party se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 In such a situation, Owaisi, who won the Lok Sabha seat for the third time in a row, seems to be increasing the difficulty for the SP
 unki party ko aamtaur par muslim rajnatik sanghathan yaa muslim samaaj ke pratinidhi ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Muslims have been supporting Owaisi's party in a large number in Andhra and Telangana
 upi main muslim sapa se naaraaz hai
 The BSP is not trusted
 congress kaa vajood nahin he
 Will not vote for BJP to aise main ovaisi kii party ko upi ke musalamaanon kaa saath mil saktaa he
 Yes, if there is a split in the Muslim vote, only BJP will get the benefit

 piji main mere saath aath ladkiyaan rahati thim
 For him, going home was like a celebration
 mujhe ghar janaa acha lagata tha lekin main unke jaise pagal nahin hoti thi
 They had many reasons and i only have so many kibaki families to meet
 wo kahati thim ki is baar ghar jaakar khub soyenge, mummy se dahi-bade banavaakar khaaenge
 Laddoos will be made
 
 
 ye khaaenge, wo khaaenge
 Will apply hair oil and do not know what
 jab wo ghar jaati thim to ek bag main gande kapade thunskar le jaati thim
 She used to say that the mother would wash
 jab ghar se lautati thim to unka wo ek bag teen-chaar chote-chote bag main badal jaataa tha
 One had lentils, rice, flour and all the things needed
 ek main khaane-pine kii wo chijen jo unki pasandida hoti thim or ek main unke dhule hue kapadon ke saath ek-do nae kapade
 The day she returned, that night she used to call me in her room
 saamaan dikhaati thim or khaane-pine kii chijen detii thim
 i used to like it but i was very jealous of them
 bahut zyada
 Realized his weakness
 us din bhi bahut bura laga jab main jindagi kii nai shuruyaat karne ja rahi thi
 Everyone was standing with me but you were not
 sab kah rahe the main bahut sundar dikh rahi hum, main ye baat aapse sunanaa chaahati thi
 i wanted my ritual to be with your hand, but it did not happen
 bahut roi main us din
 And sometimes you would be happy by making fantasies about you
 us din laga vaaki ek beti kii jindagi main bahut se aise maukey aate hai jab use sirf apni maa chahie hoti he or sirf vahi chahie hoti he
 Now i have a small house of my own which i keep very diligently
 jaise aap rakhti thim
 Learned a lot from you but did not learn to cook and now i am suffering from it
 you-tub par dekhakar khaanaa banaati hum yaa phir mobile par puch-poochkar
 You have many such big and small complaints, but i am happy that you never treated me like 'phool-kumari'
 majboot banaaya
 Taught every job without which it would be difficult to survive and the biggest thing was to teach yourself trust
 main karti hum
 a mother teaches a lot to her children, continues to teach throughout her life, but the most important thing she teaches is to believe
 khud par or un par jo vaaki uske liye hon
 You taught me this in a short time
 aap hotin to main or bhi bahut kuch sikh jaati
 Everything would have been better
 
 
 par aapkaa nahin hokar bhi hona hi meri strength he
 Thanks so much for everything
 
 
 happy madars de mummy
 And yes
 
 
 main roj shaam ko ek gilaas doodh piti hum
 But i am still as thin as you made the rule

 bharat or australia ke bich bengaluru main khel gaye chaar test maichon kii siries ke duusare match se shuru hua diares vivaad thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 While the ICC has refused to take any action against Steve Smith and Virat Kohli, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has also withdrawn its complaint after lengthy deliberations
 in kadamon ke baad mana ja rahaa tha ki maamla ab shant ho jayega, lekin media or kai khilaadiyon ke bich isaki charchaa ab jari he
 Meanwhile, an Australian newspaper has moved away from this, taking the target of Team India captain Virat Kohli and coach Anil Kumble and has made many sensational allegations on him, which has taken the matter again
 newspaper ke anusaar bhartiya captain or coach ne bengaluru test ke dauraan khel bhaavana ke khilaaf jaakar kaam kiye hai
 Let us know what allegations the newspaper has made
 
 
 bengaluru test kii duusari pari ke dauraan steve smith ne ampire dwaara out die jane ke baad dressing room se madad ke liye ishaara karnaa chaha tha
 Although the umpire had barred him from doing so, many former cricketers and the Indian media had called for action against Smith, terming it against the spirit of the game, while the Australian Cricket Board and the media there favored Steve Smith
 Rescued
 ab ek newspaper ne na keval smith kaa bachaav kiya he, balki team india ke mukhya coach anil kumble or captain viraat kohli par kai aarope laga die hai
 The Daily Telegraph wrote in its report that Indian captain Virat Kohli killed an Australian officer with an energy drink bottle (gatorade)
 itnaa hi nahin newspaper ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki bhartiya coach or purv spinner anil kumble duusari pari main viraat kohli ko out die jane ke baad us par spashtikaran maangane ke liye match ke dauraan hi adhikariyon ke box main ghus gaye the
 The comments paper ke anusaar vaise to international kochon ko adhikariyon ke box main jane kii manaahi nahin hoti, lekin bich match main aisa dekha nahin jaataa
 Going further, the paper has also written that Kumble played the main motivator in the Monkeygate scandal between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds during the 2007-08 border-gavaskar series
 paper ke anusaar kumble ne in sabamein parde ke peeche se bhoomika nibhaai he
 The report also accused Virat Kohli of using obscene language towards the Australian box, as well as making a gesture of slapping neck towards batsman Peter Handscomb
 iske saath hi newspaper ne viraat kohli ko villen bataate hue unki tulana srilanka ke purv captain arjuna rantunga se kii he or unhen khel bhaavana ko thes pahunchane vaala bataaya he
 The report also said that in this match, the spirit of the game was kept on hold several times
 newspaper ne isisi par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha he, "bengaluru main viraat kohli ke maidan ke bheetar or baahar ke kharaab vyavhaar par koi karrwai nahin karke isisi ne ek tarah se test cricket main ek prakaar kii araajaktaa ko hari jhandi de di he
 ' gauratlab he ki NDTV se baatcheet main team india ke purv captain or mahanatam ballebaaj sunil gavaskar ne bhi isisi ko steve smith par karrwai nahin karne ko lekar latada tha or kaha tha ki yadi iske baad viraat bhi agle test main smith jaisaa hi kuch karte hai, to phir kya hoga
 This means that both sides are demanding action on their part
 aise main sambhaavna he ki yah maamla kuch or lanbaa khinch jaae

 The clean cite that both sides are demanding action against each other on their behalf
 aise main sambhaavna he ki yah maamla kuch or lanbaa khinch jaae
 
 
 According to the paper, although international coaches are not allowed to enter the box of officials, but this is not seen in the middle match
 isse aage badhate hue paper ne yah bhi likhaa he ki saal 2007-08 kii border-gavaskar siries ke dauraan harbhajan singh or andryu symonds ke bich hue mankigate cond main bhi kumble ne mukhya prerak kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 According to the paper, Kumble played a role behind the scenes in all these
 report main viraat kohli par yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya he ki unhone australian box kii ore ashleel bhashaa kaa istemaal karne ke saath hi ballebaaj peter hendscomb kii ore gardan retane kaa ishaara bhi kiya tha
 Along with this, the newspaper has described Virat Kohli as a villain and compared him to former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga and described him as a victim of sportsmanship
 report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki is match main unki ore se kai baar khel bhaavana ko taak par rakhaa gaya
 The newspaper has also targeted the ICC, saying, "by not taking any action on the bad behavior inside and outside Virat Kohli's ground in Bengaluru, the ICC has kind of cleared a chaos in Test cricket
" ' Significantly, in a conversation with NDTV, former India captain and greatest batsman Sunil Gavaskar also lambasted the ICC for not taking action on Steve Smith and said that if Virat also does something similar to Smith in the next Test, Then what will happen
 matlab saaf he ki donon hi paksh apni ore se ek-duusare par karrwai kii maang kar rahe hai
 There is a possibility that the matter may be stretched a bit longer
 
 
 gauratlab he ki NDTV se baatcheet main team india ke purv captain or mahanatam ballebaaj sunil gavaskar ne bhi isisi ko steve smith par karrwai nahin karne ko lekar latada tha or kaha tha ki yadi iske baad viraat bhi agle test main smith jaisaa hi kuch karte hai, to phir kya hoga

 aise main sambhaavna he ki yah maamla kuch or lanbaa khinch jaae

 The Railway Ministry is going to develop a mobile app with the intention of telling people the right price for food and drink in the moving train
 rail mantralay ko soshal media ke jariye khaane-pine kii chizon kii overcharging kii har maheene ek lakh se zyada shikaayatein mil rahi hai
 According to the top railway officials, it is the responsibility of the vendors in the train to provide food and drink to the people at a fixed rate of the railways, but this is not usually happening
 isse mantralay kaaphi chintit he
 The special thing is that out of the total 1 lakh complaints received by the Ministry of Railways on social media, there are about 29000 complaints, poor quality of food items and overcharging
 rail mantralay samay-samay par sambandhit vendoron par jurmaana thoktaa rahata he, lekin in sabake baavjood is samasya se judi shikayaton main koi kami nahin najar aa rahi he
 IRCTC provides catering on many premium trains such as Shatabdi and Rajdhani in trains, but in most trains across the country, food is owned by private vendors
 inamen bhi turra ye he ki badi sankhya main khan-paan kaa jimmaa ek hi vendor kii alag-alag companiyon ko mila hua he
 The food that the private vendors serve inside the trains is poor in quality or otherwise, it costs more
 masalan pani kii bottle kii train ke andar tay keemat 15 rupee he, lekin zyaadaatar jagahon par vendor tay keemat se zyada vasuul rahe hai or iske alaava tay brands rail nir yaa iske samakaksh brands kii bajaay local brands ko trainon main zyada keemat par bechaa ja rahaa he
 Similarly, tea and coffee cups have been found to be smaller than the fixed size
 rail main safar karne vaale zyaadaatar yatri is tarah kii samasyaon se do-chaar ho rahe hai
 Apart from this, there have also been complaints that the food and staff staff in Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains ask for tip from the passengers
 rail board ke ek aalaa afasar ke mutabik haal-philhal main had to tab ho gai jab raksha mantri manohar parikar or soochna-prasaaran rajya mantri rajyavardhan singh rathore ek train main jaipur ja rahe the to unase khan-paan stoff ne tip kii maang kar di
 Due to such incidents, the image of the railway is greatly damaged
 is cheez ko lekar rail mantri suresh prabhu kaaphi chintit hai
 Prabhu has urged his ministry officials to find a solution to this problem
 isi ke chalate rail mantralay ne iarsitisi ko mobile ke jariye online khaanaa order karne kii pahal ko aage badhaayaa tha
 Despite all this, the trend of booking food online on mobile is not catching up strongly
 lihaaja rail mantralay kii chintaa doguni ho chuki he, jahaan ek taraf online on demand mobile par khaanaa book karaane kii muhim naakaam hoti hui najar aa rahi he to vahiin duusari taraf privet vendor khan-paan main dhaandhlee machaae hue he
 To deal with this situation, the Railway Ministry has been continuously running campaigns on its Twitter handle to complain of overcharging people on its Twitter handle

 Bharat Singh Solanki's return as state Congress president and his quick efforts are reviving the party
 gujarat ke purv mukhyamantri or diggaj congressi madhav singh solanki ke bete bharat singh aktubar main hone vaale nirnaayak sthaneey nikaay chunaavon or 2017 main vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle party main utsaah bharne kii harsambhav koshish kar rahe hai
 Prior to this, he has held this position from 2006 to 2008
 kaaryakartaaon main anushaasan se lekar party padon ke aavanton ko chaak-chauband karne tak, solanki ne apane pehle kadam se bharosa dikhaaya he
 Within a month of assuming office on March 1, he has reduced the number of general secretaries in the state Congress from 32 to 8, vice-presidents 13 to 7 and spokespersons 10 to 4
 unke purvavarti arjuna modhwadiya ne loksabhaa chunaav main 26 main se ek bhi seat na jeet paane kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue istipha de diya tha
 Says a Congress leader, "the party was transformed into a vegetable market, Solanki has returned his honor
" "solanki ne nikaay chunaavon ko dekhte hue party kaa puraa report card taiyaar karne ke liye sabhi 30 jila ikaayiyon main se harek ke liye do-do sadasyeey samitiyaan banaai hai
 The BJP eliminated the Congress in the 2006 and 2010 elections
 unhone shahari ilaakon ke liye alag samitiyaan banaai hai jahaan bijepi congress ko hameshaa pachhadti rahi he
 He is focusing on those middle class and urban voters who have always stayed away from the Congress
 congress ko rajya vidhansabha chunaavon main pichhali jeet 20 saal pehle 1995 main mili thi
 Solanki's biggest challenge is Modi's disciple Anandiben Patel
 patel 2017 ke chunaavon ke liye koi kasar baaki nahin chhod rahi hai, chaahe sthaneey swaitshasi nikaayon main mahilaon ke liye 50 fisadi aarakshan kaa unka faisla ho yaa pehali baar gender-bajet pesh karnaa, jisamen 67 scimen mahilaon ko samarpit hai
 Patel has also given the slogan of 'dynamic Gujarat' in which he has set a specific time frame to achieve the set targets
 lekin solanki ko is tathy main ummid najar aati he ki ve obisi kshatriya jati se hai or rajya main patel mukhyamantri ke khilaaf uski ahmiyat zyada he
 There is a history of patel-kshatriya enmity here
 apni sthiti majboot karne or patel vot bank ko bhi lubhaane ke liye unhone do patel netaaon ko upaadhyaksh niyukt kiya he
 Solanki's immediate challenges are panchayat and corporation elections
 kapaas, moongfalee or chini ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya ke masale par ve centre sarkaar or bijepi ko gherne kii taiyaari main hai
 State Congress General Secretary Nishith Vyas says, "the issue is affecting farmers in Gujarat
 ve bijepi se khaase naaraaz hai
 "on the cotton issue, the Congress says that the UPA has fixed a minimum support price of Rs
 se badhaakar 800 ru
 Had done it
 use ummid he ki chini sahakaari companiyon ko iskar main mili chhot ko centre sarkaar kii ore se waapas lenaa bhi use kisaan-virdohi sabit kar sakegaa
 Gujarat is the only state which imposes 4% VAT on fertilizers and makes them expensive
 aane vaali chunautiyon ke bare main puche jane par solanki ne saaf jawaab nahin diya, "ham apane virodhiyon kii kamajoriyon kii bajaae apni takat badhaane ke bare main zyada soch rahe hai
 Our work will speak
 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav apwaad tha or use maanak ke taur par nahin liya ja saktaa
 "but returning to the state after two decades is not easy for Solanki and Congress
 pradhanmantri apni shishyaa kii jeet sunishchit karne ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 Solanki currently has to strengthen the organizational structure of the party, boost the morale of the workers and work hard towards making the Congress likely to win
 2014 main bijepi ke haathon apni aanand loksabhaa seat par haar kii chot kha chuke solanki ko pataa he ki rajya main apni or congress kii praasangikta banaae rakhane kii koshish main unhen koi riyaayat nahin milane vaali
 In the last 48 hours, the state of Bihar has turned 380 degrees

 baahar lalu yadav ne nitish par khub tir chalaae
 Now Nitish has also hit back and said that the people of Bihar had given the mandate to work

 What did Nitish say? On the rjd's allegations of betrayal for the last two days, Nitish Kumar said that the people of Bihar had given him a mandate to work and not to indulge
 congress par bhi nitish hamalavar dikhe
 Nitish said in the assembly that when the Grand Alliance was formed, the Congress was only going to get 15 to 20 seats, but he took the initiative to contest 40 seats
 nitish kumaar ne samarthan ke liye vidhayakon kaa shukriya adaa kiya
 Votnish said he could not compromise on his principles and good governance
 nitish ne kaha ki jo log dharmanirpekshata kaa paath unhen padhaa rahe hai unhen janata ke hit main kaam karnaa chahie
 Nitish said that corruption cannot be tolerated under any circumstances
 ek parivaar kii seva ke liye vot nahin mila tha
 What Tejaswi said Before this, before the floor test in the Bihar Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav strongly attacked Nitish and said that Nitish turned from Ram to Jayashreeram for his own benefit
 tejasvi ne kaha ki bijepi-jediu kaa game fiks tha or sangh mukt bharat kii baat karte-karte nitish kumaar sangh kii godi main jaakar baithak gaye
 On the other hand, Lalu Yadav also attacked Nitish fiercely
 lalu ne ajtak ke saath baatcheet main kaha ki nitish kumaar ko kam siten milane ke baavjood hamanen siem banaaya tha lekin nitish ne bijepi se santhganth kar liya
 The battle of Mamlal Bihar reached the court is no longer a political one
 argedy ne nitish sarkaar banavaane ke rajyapal ke faisle ke khilaaf hoicourt ne manjuur kar lee he
 a hearing on this will be held on Monday
 gauratlab he ki buudhvaar ko nitish ne achaanak apane pad se istipha dekar sabko chaunkaa diya tha
 With this, Nitish lost his relationship with Lalu and within a few hours Nitish formed the government with the BJP
 guuruuvaar ko nitish ne shapath liya or shuukravaar ko bahumat sabit kar liya
 That is, the state of Bihar has completely changed within 48 hours
 endie ke kheme main nitish kaa janaa 2019 se pehle rashtriya mahagathbandhan ke vipakshi sapane par bhi kutharaghaat bataaya ja rahaa he

 In many cities in the country, people are facing cash shortage in atms
 kai jagah atm ke baahar qatari bhi lagi dekhi ja rahi hai
 Actually, due to apprehensions about the FRDI (financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance) bill, it has increased in people to hold large notes (2000 and 500) with them
 vahiin, sarkaar ne desh ke kai hisson main note kii killat ko khatm karne ke liye supplai or chapai donon tej kar di he
 Sanjeev Sanyal, the chief economic adviser of the finance ministry, claims that the situation will become completely normal within a week to the extent
 ol india bank officers kanfedereshan (AIBOC) ke dilli kshetra ke pramukh ravindra gupta kaa bhi kahana he ki sthiti ko saamaanya hone main 7 se 10 din lag sakate hai
 In a special conversation with 'aaj Tak', Sanyal said that the hype about cash at this time is completely shocking as the Reserve Bank has no cash shortage
 sanyaal ke mutabik sarkaar is baat kii gaharaai se jaanch kar rahi he ki achaanak bina kisi thos kaaran cash kii maang itani zyada kaise bad gai
 Sanyal said that this problem first started in Karnataka and Telangana and then spread to some other parts of the country
 karnataka main agle maheene chunaav hone hai
 In some places, Sanyal said it was wrong to compare the minor cash issue with the days of demonetisation, because the government now has enough cash in reserve to deal with any situation
 unhone kaha ki aamtaur par kabhi kabhaar kisi ilaake main kuch khaas mulya ke noton kii kami ho jaati he
 If excess cash is diverted to the market, it affects inflation
 sanyaal ke mutabik is vakt sarkaar ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki mahangaai kaabo main he isiilie or note chhap kar bazaar main utaarne main sarkaar ko koi dikkat nahin he
 To deal with the cash, the Finance Ministry has set up a task force which is monitoring the situation and the situation will be completely normalized within a few days
 vitt mantralayake pramukh aarthik salaahkaar ne kaha ki chunaav isaki sirf ek vajah ho sakati he, lekin saath main kuch aisi baaten jarur hai jisaki vajah se achaanak nagdi kii itani maang badi
 When asked if there could be a deliberate conspiracy behind it, he did not give a direct answer
 unhone bas yahi kaha ki sarkaar kaarnon kaa pataa karne ke liye jute chuki he
 According to sources, the government believes that there may be a conspiracy to discredit the government behind the problem being faced with the note
 sanjeev sanyaal se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya sachmuch sarkaar ne 2000 kenoton kii supplai bandakar di he to unhone mana ki pichley kuch maheenon se 2000 ke note supplai nahin ho rahe hai
 This is because it was found that small notes are more useful to people
 lekin agar jarurat mahasoos hui to dobaaraa 2000 ke note chhap kar bazaar main utaare ja sakate hai
 He did not rule out the possibility that people were depositing 2000 notes and some of it may be black money
 sanyaal ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki ek ke baad ek bank ghotaalon kii vajah se logon kaa bharosa bainkon ko lekar kam ho rahaa he
 He said that scams used to happen earlier too, but the difference is that this government is going to the root of these scams and exposing them and taking concrete steps to correct them
 yah puche jane par ki kya note kii kami ke peeche logon ke man main echardiai bill ko lekar ashanka bhi ho sakati he unhone kaha ki isko lekar sarkaar kai baar apni baat saaf kar chuki he ki bainkon main logon kaa paisa puri tarah se surakshit he or kisi ko is bare main chintaa karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 At the same time Gupta, head of Delhi region of AIBOC, believes that the lack of cash is mainly due to dependence on large denomination notes
 desh main jitani bhi karansi chalan main he, unamem se 90 fisadi 2000 or 500 rupye ke noton main he
 Gupta does not rule out the possibility of hoarding of 2000 notes
 kuch maheene pehle hi RBI kii ore se 2000 ke noton ko chhapana band kiye jane ke baad se is mulya ke noton kii jamkhori badi he
 Apart from this, cash is not being distributed equally to the states according to their ratio, due to this, there is a feeling of cash shortage in some states
 loksabhaa main aakhirkaar lalit modi maamle par sthagan prastaav par bahes hui lekin hairaan karne vaali baat rahi ki pradhanmantri narendra modi khud videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa bachaav karne ke liye sadan main maujuud nahin the
 The question is why the Prime Minister was not in the house when the party was defending the allegations against its top minister
 aisa bhi nahin tha ki pradhanmantri dilli ke baahar kisi daure par hon balki jis vakt sansad main sthagan prastaav par bahes chal rahi thi us vakt pradhanmantri modi bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee se mil rahe the
 It is interesting that while PM was not in the House to speak in favor of Sushma, LK Advani was seen encouraging him during Sushma Swaraj's speech
 bhaashan khatm hone par unhone sushamaa swaraj kii peeth bhi thapthapai
 Not only Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi was also present in the House
 kya ye bijepi main aane vaale dinon kii raajnneeti kaa sanket he? If Prime Minister Modi had stayed in the house and defended, then Sushma Swaraj's situation would have been better
 swaraj ne apane bhaashan ke aakhir main kaha ki unka raajnneetik safar 38 saal kii tapasya he or isamen koi daag nahin he
 On this occasion, does the Prime Minister stand up and say the same thing in favor of his minister, does not strengthen Swaraj more
 yah is puure maamle ke saamne aane ke baad pradhananmatri ne chuppi hi saadhe rakhi he
 When Arun Jaitley also rose to speak on this matter, he too was favoring the government and not Sushma's side
 unke bolon se ye bhi saaf nahin hua ki kya sarkaar sushamaa swaraj kii maanviya aadhaar par kii gai madad kii daleel vaali baat par unke saath he? balki sarkaar to sushamaa swaraj kii daleel se duuri banaate huye dikhi
 Sushma Swaraj is a skilled speaker
 apni vakpatutaa se unhone kai maamalon ko dhakne kii koshish kii
 Still, she was seen attacking Congress mistakes, including the Quattrocchi and Anderson cases
 jab apane pati or beti ke bachaav main boleen to usamen na to dhar thi na aakraamakata
 After listening carefully to her statements, it is revealed that she was not speaking with confidence and assertiveness
 is puure maamle ke uthne ke baad bijepi kii andruni raajnneeti kii charchaa bhi lagaataar ho rahi he
 The comments sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali ke bich to shityudh jagazahir he
 So, that is why Sushma Swaraj's fiercest attack was about the case of P
 Chidambaram and his wife Nalani Chidambaram
 jo raajnneeti ko samajhate hai vah bataayenge ki pi chidambaram par hamale ko siyaasi nazar se vittamantri arun jetali par nishane ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, there is also a question, why did the government give the opposition a chance to create a ruckus for so many days? Did this not weaken Sushma Swaraj
 yahi bahes agar sansad main do teen din ke hangaame ke baad kara lee jaati to shaayad sushamaa swaraj itani kamazor na dikhti

 This is the silence that the Prime Minister has kept silent after this whole matter came to light
 arun jetali bhi jab is maamle main bolne ke liye uthe to vah bhi sarkaar kaa paksh rakh rahe the sushamaa kaa paksh nahin
 It is also not clear from his words whether the government is with Sushma Swaraj on the plea of humanitarian help
 Rather, the government appeared to be keeping distance from Sushma Swaraj's plea

 Sachin Dev Burman's death anniversary On October 31, Sachin Dev Burman, who was active in special Hindi and Bangla films, was a music composer with an eclectic mix of folk songs, classical and Rabindra music in his songs
 hindi cinema main 1950 or 60 ke dashak main vishesh rup se sakriy sachin dev burman ke gaanon main virah, ashavad or darshan ke alaava romaaniat kii jhalak bhi khub dikhti he
 Sachin Dev Burman, who captivated the interest of music lovers of every category with his tunes, had made his mark in the northeast folk music programs broadcast on radio before coming to films
 yuvavastha main vah purvottar ke rajyon or pashchim bengal main khub ghume jisase unhone vibhinn kshetron ke loksangit kii acchhee jaankaree ho gayi or iskaa bahut acha upyog unhone apni dhunon main kiya
 He converted the western music into Indian color and gave it a melodious music
 tripura ke shahi parivaar main ek aktubar 1906 ko paidaa sachin dev kii ruchi shuru se hi sangeet main thi or unhone isaki vidhivat shiksha bhi lee
 Sachin Dev, an expert in classical and Rabindra Sangeet was also an excellent singer
 unke nidhan ke teen dashak se adhik ho chuke hai lekin unke sangitabaddh geeton ke saath hi unke gaae geeton ko pasand karne waalon kii ab bhi acchhee sankhya he
 Sachin Dev gave all the clouds in the guide, give water
 
 , Who is there, where will your traveler go? 
 , We are the priests of love in the film Prem Pujari
 
 , In songs like Surajata, Sun Mere Bandhu Re, Sun Mere Mitwa, made his voice immortal
 unhone film talash, bandini, amar prem aadi filmon main bhi gaanon ko apni aawaaj di
 Apart from Virah, Darshan is also seen in many songs sung by him
 aise pratibhashali sangeetkaar ke liye bhi hindi filmon main kadam jamaana kathin sabit hua or vah ek samay waapas kolkata lautne kaa man bana chuke the
 But he stopped at the behest of veteran actor Ashok Kumar, which proved to be a boon in terms of Hindi cinema music
 sachin dev ne dev anand ke navakethan binar ke alaava vimal raay, guru dutt, rishikesh mukherjee kii kai filmon main behtareen sangeet diya
 He also had music in the 1969 film Aradhana
 is film se ek ore superstar rajesh khanna kaa udai hua vahiin gayak kishor kumaar ke kariyar ko bhi nayi unchai mili
 Sachin Dev was among those musicians who kept pace with the changing times and his music continued to be popular even during the period when the magic of his musicians began to wane
 1970 ke dashak main unhone sharmili, tere mere sapane, phaguna, abhimaan, mili, chupake chupake jaisi filmon main hit sangeet diya
 But in later days, health began to leave and finally on 31 October 1975 the talented musician passed away

 iske liye bijepi ne sabhi 11 vidhaan parishad siton par ummidavaar utaarne kaa faisla kiya he, jiske liye screening shuru kar di he
 The prospective candidates of teacher unions are in the process of getting tickets from BJP
 dinesh sharma or ashok kataaria ko jimmedaarisutron kii maane to snaatak evam shikshak kshetra ke vidhaan parishad chunaav kii kaman parde ke peeche se up mukhyamantri dow
 Dinesh Sharma is watching
 sharma vidhaan parishad main sadan ke netaa bhi hai
 The responsibility of bringing state-aided and non-finance teachers' unions to the bjp's responsibility rests with them
 dipti siem dinesh sharma ne kaha ki bijepi pehali baar shikshak sangh ke vidhaan parishad kaa chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 While we have been fighting for the election of graduates
 bijepi puri koshish or takat ke saath emelsi kaa chunaav ladegi
 We will strive to win as many seats as possible
 bijepi ne sabhi 11 siton se sambandhit jila adhyakshon or jila prabhariyon ko shikshak evam snaatak ke zyada se zyada matadaataaon ke naam matadaata suchi main judwane kii jimmedaari saunp di he
 bjp's state general secretary and in-charge of council elections, Ashok Kataria, have started planning strategy according to local equations after holding election meetings
 shikshak sanghon kii badi tensionshikshak sangh ke lemali umesh dvivedi ne aajtak
 Talking to in, both BJP and Congress national parties have not yet contested the MLC elections of Teachers Union
 yah pehali baar he ki bijepi chunavi maidan main apane ummidavaar utaarne ja rahi he
 Even if the BJP wins all 11 seats, it will not be able to touch the majority figure in the Legislative Council
 umesh dvivedi ne kaha ki shikshakon ko raajnneeti partiyon ke bich nahin baantnaa chahie
 The bjp's entry into the electoral fray will adversely affect the minds of the people and the school environment will also be spoiled
 aise main abhi tak jis tarah se rashtriya partiyaan isse dur thi unhen dur hi rahanaa chahie
 This is the math of the state's legislative council seats
 Let us know that Uttar Pradesh has a total of 100 legislative council seats
 inamen se bijepi ke paas mahaj 21 sadsy hai
 While SP has 55 members and BSP has 8 Legislative Council members
 iske alaava congress ke paas do sadsy hai, jinamein se ek sadsy dinesh pratap singh ne bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 Apart from these, 5 members are elected by the graduates and 6 members are elected by the teachers union
 uttar pradesh main snaatak evam shikshak kshetra ke 11 vidhaan parishad sadasyon kaa kaarykaal may 2020 main puraa ho rahaa he
 In such a situation, elections will be held in these 11 seats in march-april
 in sadasyon ke kshetra kai jile or kai mandalon ko milakar hote hai
 That is why the BJP wants to give its candidate enough time to campaign before taking off their candidate
 aise main dekhnaa hoga ki bijepi snaatak evam shikshak kshetra ke vidhaan parishad ke chunaav main kis tarah kaa pradarshan karti he
