 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne janalokapal bill paas karaane ko lekar ek baar phir se apni patibaddhta doharaate hue kaha ki dilli vidhansabha main agar janalokapal bill paas nahin hua, to vah apane pad se istipha de denge
 Kejriwal said in a special conversation with NDTV on Sunday, "the passing of the Jan Lokpal bill is more important than our staying in power
" agar janalokapal bill paas nahin hua to ham istipha de denge
 ' unhone kaha ki ki congress or bijepi janalokapal ke raste main adnga lagane kii koshish kar rahi hai or agar vidhansabha main unhone is bill main adnga lagaaya, to vah apni kursi bhi qurbaan kar denge
 He said that if the Congress does not support, i will resign and the people will teach the Congress a lesson
 unhone kaha ki unki sarkaar 13 farvari ko janalokapal bill ko vidhansabha main pesh karegi
 Earlier, Kejriwal had said that he never thought that he would ever enter politics
 pichley maheene kuch pulicekarmiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang karte hue abhootpurv tareeke se dharne par baithe kejariwal ne us samay khud ko 'araajaktaavaadi' kaha tha
 Today, he interprets that remark, arguing that corrupt political and corporate leaders, some bureaucrats and some media people are living happily, while the common man is unhappy
 kejariwal ne kaha, jab ham vyavastha ko badalane kii baat karte hai to in logon ke liye yah araajaktaa main badal jaati he
 To him, yes, i am an anarchist
 yah sawaal kiye jane par ki kya vah khud ko raajnneetik krantikari kahenge, 45-varshiya netaa ne kaha, haa, raajnneetik krantikari, haa
 He was asked what he would say to those who called him a dictator
 is par kejariwal ne kaha, kya aapako lagata he ki prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav jaise log ek taanashaah ke saath kaam kar sakate hai? bahut se log hamaare paas aa rahe hai
 Will they work with a dictator? kejariwal ne kaha ki 'aap' kaa netritv 'samagrata' main rahaa he or yadi ham taanashaah hote to, chaar log bhi hamaare saath khadey nahin hote
 Asked if he ever thought his dreams would go to politics, Kejriwal said that after the party was formed in October 2012, he hoped to do something good, but did not think that he would be the Chief Minister of Delhi
 Will become
 is sawaal par ki kya ab unki pradhanmantri banane kii tamanna he, unhone naa main jawaab diya or jor dete hue kaha ki unka makasad bharat ko bhrashtachar mukt bananaa he, jiske liye 'aap' kaa sangharsh jari he
 He said, we have not come here to do power politics
 yah puche jane par ki kya iske baavjood vah pradhanmantri banenge, kejariwal ne kaha, koi bhi bhavishyavaanee kar sakate hai
 Who knows? kejariwal ke liye abhi yah tay nahin he ki vah loksabhaa chunaav ladenge yaa nahin, lekin unhone kaha, yadi jarurat padi, to main chunaav laduunga, lekin meri pehali praathamikta dilli he
 He said that AAP will identify those Lok Sabha constituencies from where corrupt candidates of other parties are contesting elections and we will fight against them
 yah sankhya 150 yaa 200 yaa 250 athwa 350 ho sakati he
 Kejriwal said, we are not saying that our party will form the government at the Center
 
 
 lekin hamaare log jitne adhik sankhya main sansad ke liye nirvaachit honge, utana hi bhrasht logon ke liye mushkil badhegi
 Refusing to comment on Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal said, "I can only say that both are part of the same political system and i don't think you have any hope from both
" kejariwal is maamle main puri tarah spasht the ki loksabhaa chunaav main trishanku faisla aane kii surat main 'aap' kisi raajnneetik dal ke saath nahin jaaegi yaa 'satta kii raajnneeti' main bhagidaar nahin banegi
 The Chief Minister said, we will live, fight and die, you will see
 kejariwal khud ko jaldbaaji vaale mukhyamantri kehalaae jane kaa bura nahin maanate
 He says, i think anyone should be in a hurry
 samay kam he or jindagi choti he
 There are only 24 hours in a day
 yah puche jane par ki satta kii kursi par baithne ke baad unki jindagi main kya badlaav aayaa he, kejariwal ne kaha ki iskaa sabase pehla shikaar unki paariwarik jindagi hui he
 He said, watching movies with family has stopped on Saturday
 kejariwal ke sarkari awaas main koi pados nahin he
 In Ghaziabad, where he had previously lived, his mother and wife used to go out of the house and chat with neighbors

 pavitra amarnath gupha 13 hajaar foot kii oonchai or dilli se 950 kimi kii duuri par he
 We planned to see the holy Amarnath
 is yojana main kai adchane maujuud thim
 The biggest hitch was the frequently changing bad weather
 baari barish ke chalate hajaaron yatriyon ko jagah jagah roka gaya
 Constant landslides and glacier shattering hindered the closure of the road and another challenge was our security amidst terrorist threats
 aamtaur par dilli se pavitra amarnath gupha tak kii yatra paanch din kii maani jaati he
 We also completed the journey to the holy Amarnath Cave by airplane, helicopter, jeep, mule and on foot
 aakhir tamaam jokhimon ke baavjood kaise enditivi india pavitra amarnath gupha tak pahunchaa ye jaanane ke liye aapako ye kahani puri padhani hogi
 The flight from Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu is at 8
45 AM
 pehle jammu, phir ham kareeb 11 baje srinagar airport par utre
 But bad weather blocked our way forward
 srinagar main ho rahi lagaataar barish ke chalate jhelum nadi khatre ke nishaan se upar bah rahi thi
 The water of the river filled the roads, due to which we had to return to the ITBP camp in Srinagar
 srinagar se pavitra amarnath yatra ke do raste hai, pehla srinagar se sonmarg, baltal, baraari hote hue pavitra amarnath gupha tak kareeb 106 kimi tak kaa safar
 The second is about 325 km from Jammu via Pahalgam, Chandanwadi, Flea Top, Sheshnag, Panchtarini to Amarnath Cave
 baari barish kii vajah se sadak kaa rasta kharaab ho gaya tha jisase hajaaron yatri jagah-jagah funs gaye
 Then we decided to go from Srinagar to Sonamarg and then from Sonamarg to Panchtarini to Amarnath cave
 srinagar main chaar ghante rukne ke baad ham gaadi se sonmarg ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Due to floods in Srinagar in 2014, thousands of vehicles were flooded due to which people parked vehicles on the road before the rain
 srinagar se sonmarg kareeb 80 kimi dur he
 But due to bad weather we reached Sonamarg in the late night
 raatbhar barish ke baad subah sonmarg kaa mausam saaf hua to hamane phir apni yatra shuru kii
 We were accompanied by IPS officer Rajababu Singh, Inspector Sanjeev Mandal of Delhi Police, Ashok Kasana of SS Techno Company and Ajay Upadhyay
 sabane kaha ki ham pehle nilgrant jaaenge
 Then from there he will go to Panchtarini by helicopter, then from there he will travel to Amarnath by foot or mule
 lekin kehete hai ki pahaad ke mausam ko samajhnaa bahut mushkil he
 On reaching the Nilgrant helipad from Sonmarg, it started raining again and helicopter service was interrupted
 sadak ke sabhi raste band hone ke chalate nilgrant helipad se helicopter ke sahare panchtarini jane vaale hajaaron tirthayatriyon ko yahaan bhi kai din intjaar karnaa padaa
 But after a few hours the weather started to clear and our hopes of reaching Panchtarini started increasing
 ab mausam dhire-dhire saaf hone laga
 The rainy clouds started slowly sorting
 hamaara helicopter udaan ke liye taiyaar hone laga
 We boarded a helicopter
 udaan ke dauraan panchtarini nadi ke upar kareeb saat minute kii udaan ke baad ham panchtarini ghati pahunch gaye
 Five rivers are found here, due to which this river is called Panchtarini river
 yahaan hajaaron tambu is lage hai
 Passengers arriving here in the afternoon are not allowed to go up to Amarnath
 ham dopaher kareeb 12
 Reached Panchtarini at 30
 yahaan lagaataar ho rahi barish ke chalate rasta kharaab ho chukaa tha
 We were to return to this helipad of Panchtarini by five o'clock
 shaam ko phir se mausam kharaab hone kaa anumaan tha
 The comments panchtarini se pavitra amarnath gupha tak jane ke teen tareeke hai
 Either you climb here on foot or you can also go to the holy Amarnath cave with palanquin and mule
 do kimi tak paidal chalane ke baad hamen kichad se bharaa itnaa kharaab rasta mila ki paidal chalanaa lagbhag naammumkin sa ho gaya tha
 The path had become very slippery due to rain
 ek baar to main bhi khachchar se khai main girte girte bachaa
 Shabbir, who was walking with the mule, somehow managed
 shabbir jaise hajaaron sthaneey logon ke sahyog ke bina baba amarnath kii yatra puri nahin ho sakati he
 There is a place between Panchtarini to reach Amarnath valley which is called Sangam
 ek chota sa pagadendinuma rasta pahalgam se aakar yahaan miltaa he
 The distance of the holy Amarnath cave from this place is three km
 bam bam bhole bolte hue ham yatra ke khatarnaak raaston se aage bad rahe hai
 Now we have reached the Amarnath valley
 ye ghati kabhi barf se dhaki rahati thi
 But this year the glacier is much lower
 jo glacier he wo bhi lagaataar pighalkar gir rahe hai jisase jaan kaa khatra baraabar bana rahata he
 We get a glimpse of the holy cave from the Amarnath Valley, devotees take many risks to see it
 lekin is kathin yatra par mausam kii maar ke saath aatanki khatre kaa saaya bhi he, lihaaja 40 hajaar surakshakarmi chappe chappe par tainaat hai
 Concerns of security personnel are also the passengers who become ill in bad weather with terrorist attack
 amarnath gupha ke paas kii pahari sheshnag pahari dikhti he jo barf se dhaki he
 Baba Amarnath's cave is about twenty meters long and 16 meters wide
 isi ke andar hamen pavitra amarnath ke is tarah darshan mili
 The story of Baba Amarnath is no less interesting
 dilli se srinagar vaaya jammu kii flite 8 bajkar 45 minute par he
 First Jammu, then we landed at Srinagar Airport at around 11 am
 lekin kharaab mausam ne hamaara aage kaa rasta roak liya
 The Jhelum river was flowing above the danger mark due to the incessant rains in Srinagar
 nadi kaa pani sadakon par bhar gaya jiske chalate hamen srinagar ke ITBP camp main waapas lautnaa padaa
 There are two routes from Srinagar to the holy Amarnath Yatra, the first is about 106 km from Srinagar to the holy Amarnath cave via Sonamarg, Baltal, Barari
 doosraa jammu se pahalgam hote hue, chandanwari, pissu top, sheshnag, panchtarini hote hue amarnath gupha tak kareeb 325 kimi kaa safar
 Thousands of passengers were stranded due to heavy rains which damaged the roadway
 tab hamane srinagar se sonmarg or phir sonmarg se panchtarini hote hue amarnath gupha tak janaa tay kiya
 After four hours stay in Srinagar we left for Sonamarg by car
 2014 main srinagar main ai baadh ke chalate hajaaron gadiyon main pani bhar gaya tha isi ke chalate barish se pehle hi sadak par logon ne gaadiyaan khadi kar deen
 Sonamarg is about 80 km from Srinagar
 lekin kharaab mausam ke chalate ham der raat ko sonmarg pahunche
 After the overnight rain, the weather of Sonmarg cleared in the morning, then we started our journey again
 hamaare saath IPS adhikari rajababu singh, dilli police ke inspector sanjeev mandal, SS Techno company ke ashok ksaana or ajay upaadhyaay bhi the
 Everyone said that we will go to Nilgrant first
 phir vahaan se helicopter ke jariye panchtarini jaaenge, phir vahaan se paidal yaa khachchar ke jariye amarnath yatra karenge
 But it is very difficult to understand the weather of the mountain
 sonmarg se nilgrant helipad par pahunchate-pahunchate phir barish shuru ho gai or helicopter seva baadhit ho gai
 Thousands of pilgrims going to Nilgrant Helipad to Panchtarini had to wait here for several days due to the closure of all roadways
 lekin kuch hi ghanton baad mausam saaf hone laga or hamaari panchtarini pahunchane kii ummid badhane lagi
 Now the weather gradually started to clear
 barsaat ke badal dhire-dhire chantane lage
 Our helicopter started getting ready for flight
 ham helicopter main savaar ho gaye
 During the flight we reached the Panchtarini valley after a flight of about seven minutes over the Panchtarini river
 yahaan paanch nadiyaan milti hai isi ke chalate is nadi ko panchtarini nadi kaha jaataa he
 Thousands of tents are installed here
 dopaher baad yahaan pahunchane vaale yatriyon ko upar amarnath nahin jane diya jaataa he
 We are around 12 noon
 30 baje panchtarini pahunch gaye
 Due to the incessant rains here, the road had deteriorated
 hamen paanch baje tak har haal main panchtarini ke is helipad par waapas aana tha
 The weather was forecast to be bad again in the evening
 tippaniyan There are three ways to get from Panchtarini to the holy Amarnath cave
 yaa to aap yahaan paidal chadhaai chadhate hai yaa phir palki or khachchar se bhi aap pavitra amarnath gupha tak ja sakate hai
 After walking for two km, we found such a bad path full of mud that walking was almost impossible
 barish ke kaaran rasta bahut phislan bharaa ho gaya tha
 Once, i too survived falling from the mule into the ditch
 khachchar ke saath chal rahe shabbir ne kisi tarah sambhala
 The journey of Baba Amarnath cannot be complete without the cooperation of thousands of locals like Shabbir
 panchtarini se amarnath ghati tak pahunchane ke bich kii ek jagah he jo sangam kehalaati he
 a small footpath road comes from Pahalgam and meets here
 is jagah se pavitra amarnath gupha kii duuri teen kimi he
 Speaking of bam bam bhole, we are moving through dangerous paths of travel
 ab ham amarnath ghati pahunch chuke hai
 This valley was once covered with snow
 lekin is saal glacier bahut kam he
 The glaciers are also constantly melting and falling, which keeps the risk of life equal
 amarnath ghati se pavitra gupha kii jhalak hamen milane lagi, isi ke darshan karne ke liye shraddhalu tamaam khatre mol lete hai
 But on this difficult journey, along with the weather, there is also the shadow of terrorist threat, so 40 thousand security personnel are deployed on the rumble
 suraksha karmiyon kii chintaa aatanki hamale ke saath kharaab mausam main biimaar hone vaale yatri bhi hai
 The hill near Amarnath Cave looks like Sheshnag Hill which is covered with snow
 baba amarnath kii gupha kareeb bees meter lambii or 16 meter chaudee he
 Within this, we got a glimpse of the holy Amarnath in this way
 baba amarnath kii katha bhi kam chilachasp nahin he
 There are two routes from Srinagar to the holy Amarnath Yatra, the first is about 106 km from Srinagar to the holy Amarnath cave via Sonamarg, Baltal, Barari

 After four hours stay in Srinagar we left for Sonamarg by car
 2014 main srinagar main ai baadh ke chalate hajaaron gadiyon main pani bhar gaya tha isi ke chalate barish se pehle hi sadak par logon ne gaadiyaan khadi kar deen
 Sonamarg is about 80 km from Srinagar
 lekin kharaab mausam ke chalate ham der raat ko sonmarg pahunche
 After the overnight rain, the weather of Sonmarg cleared in the morning, then we started our journey again
 hamaare saath IPS adhikari rajababu singh, dilli police ke inspector sanjeev mandal, SS Techno company ke ashok ksaana or ajay upaadhyaay bhi the
 Everyone said that we will go to Nilgrant first
 phir vahaan se helicopter ke jariye panchtarini jaaenge, phir vahaan se paidal yaa khachchar ke jariye amarnath yatra karenge
 But it is very difficult to understand the weather of the mountain
 sonmarg se nilgrant helipad par pahunchate-pahunchate phir barish shuru ho gai or helicopter seva baadhit ho gai
 Thousands of pilgrims going to Nilgrant Helipad to Panchtarini had to wait here for several days due to the closure of all roadways
 lekin kuch hi ghanton baad mausam saaf hone laga or hamaari panchtarini pahunchane kii ummid badhane lagi
 Now the weather gradually started to clear
 barsaat ke badal dhire-dhire chantane lage
 Our helicopter started getting ready for flight
 ham helicopter main savaar ho gaye
 During the flight we reached the Panchtarini valley after a flight of about seven minutes over the Panchtarini river
 yahaan paanch nadiyaan milti hai isi ke chalate is nadi ko panchtarini nadi kaha jaataa he
 Thousands of tents are installed here
 dopaher baad yahaan pahunchane vaale yatriyon ko upar amarnath nahin jane diya jaataa he
 We are around 12 noon
 30 baje panchtarini pahunch gaye
 Due to the incessant rains here, the road had deteriorated
 hamen paanch baje tak har haal main panchtarini ke is helipad par waapas aana tha
 The weather was forecast to be bad again in the evening
 tippaniyan There are three ways to get from Panchtarini to the holy Amarnath cave
 yaa to aap yahaan paidal chadhaai chadhate hai yaa phir palki or khachchar se bhi aap pavitra amarnath gupha tak ja sakate hai
 After walking for two km, we found such a bad path full of mud that walking was almost impossible
 barish ke kaaran rasta bahut phislan bharaa ho gaya tha
 Once, i too survived falling from the mule into the ditch
 khachchar ke saath chal rahe shabbir ne kisi tarah sambhala
 The journey of Baba Amarnath cannot be complete without the cooperation of thousands of locals like Shabbir
 panchtarini se amarnath ghati tak pahunchane ke bich kii ek jagah he jo sangam kehalaati he
 a small footpath road comes from Pahalgam and meets here
 is jagah se pavitra amarnath gupha kii duuri teen kimi he
 Speaking of bam bam bhole, we are moving through dangerous paths of travel
 ab ham amarnath ghati pahunch chuke hai

 haryana ke palaval main ek lakh ke inami badmaash hariya urf pawan kii police hiraasat main sandigdh maut ho gai
 Palwal police arrested him from Delhi a few days ago
 vah 6 din kii police remand par tha
 Meanwhile, the news of his sudden death on Sunday shocked everyone
 police ke mutabikkukhyat badmashaharia remand par chal rahaa tha
 After getting her medical, the police team was returning from the civil hospital when on the way, Hari complained of chest pain
 jiske baad police use turant waapas civil aspataal lekar pahunchi lekin vahaan doctoron ne use mrit ghoshit kar diya
 The CMO of Palwal Civil Hospital said that the police team had come to Hariya alias Pawan for medical treatment on Sunday
 medical ho jane ke baad police use lekar chali gai
 After some time the police brought him back to the hospital but by then he had died
 gangster pawan kii maut ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagane ke liye ek board banaaya gaya he
 After the report of the board, we will know what is the real reason behind the death of Hari aka Pawan
 gauratlab he ki 10 din pehle hi faridabadpulisake saath hariya gang kii muthbhed hui thi, jisamen hariya kaa ek saathi arun maaraa gaya tha
 There were cases against Hariya in Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh
 sabhi rajyon main vah wonted tha
 Therefore a reward of one lakh was placed on his head
 kitaab: chhutpan ke dinalekhak: tushaar upretikimat: 80 rupaap is book rivyuu ko pard paa rahe hai kyonki aapke paas computer he
 With the help of which you can gather information around the world
 pareshaani bas itani si he kiapaka computer un 'soochnaaon' ko 'gyaan' kaa darja nahin dilaa saktaa
 For this, it is very important for you to be aware of any sensible person or any real event
 yahi is kitaab ko likhane kii vajah bhi he
 However, first read the review of this book - well, this book did not come in our era
 varna hamaara bhi mitti khaanaa dubhar ho jaataa
 Potatoes were removed even at home
 lekin baahar angan main hamen 'mitti kaa sher' banane se koi kab tak roak paata
 It was good that he did not even know the idea of pappi's grandfather
 or us idia vaali kitaab ab ai he
 Advertisements have taught us how important it is to wash our hands with soap for our intellectual and physical development
 bechaare uppu swami ko 'haath kii safai' kii ahmiyat doctor ke clinics pahunchane par mili
 Poor! We used to get 10 rupees of pocket money every week and also used to finish it on the same day
 phir bhi skool ke baahar pheriwale ke yahaan se ham chije hafte ke har din kharidte hi the
 Where did the money come from? Now you also knew this
 paise jugadne kaa vahi formula is kitaab main bhi shaamil ek kahani 'pet puja' main kiya gaya he
 The story of the true friendship of man and animal is told in 'mastana'
 lekin hamane to aisi hi kahani mughali siries main hi dekh lee he
 Ramayana was also known in many stories
 kul milakar is kitaab main vahi sari sikh deni kii koshish kii gai he jo ham pehle se jaanate the
 Then what is the need of writing or reading this book? Actually, i remembered my childhood as soon as i read the title of the book 'days of Chutpan'
 or ye bhul gaye ki kitaab hamaare yaa aapke liye nahin he
 Rather it is for the children of smartphone age
 kitaab ke lekhar tushaar upreti bhi hamaare daur ke hi hai
 Obviously, like us, he also came to know all these things
 kabhi kisi parivaar vaale ne samajha diya
 Sometimes grandmother and grandmother told such stories that these things have been fed into our central nervous system forever
 lekin lekhak bhi samajhate hai or ham bhi jaanate hai ki aaj ke bachche daadi-nani ke kisson se koson dur hai
 Not all children are so unfortunate, but this is the problem of most children
 kaamkaaji abhibhavak bacchon ko samay nahin de paa rahe
 Teacher bus syllabus in the school are engaged in covering jet speed
 nani or daadi 'chota parivaar' ke equation main feet nahin baithtin so wo bhi gaanv main hai
 In such a situation, this 40-page book is an attempt to tell the children important things in their language
 kahaniyaan is plot par bhi likhi gayi hai, jo bacchon kii rosemara jindagi se mail khaati hai
 Therefore, children will like the story of the book
 haalanki kahin kahin par kisson ko saral banane ke chakkar main vah ajeeb si lagati hai
 But at the beginning of the book, it has been made clear that its target audience is between five and ten years old
 lihaaja har kahani main logic kii ummid karnaa bekaar he
 This book is for children, so i will definitely advise them to read it
 lekin agar bade log bhi keval 15 minute nikaalkar ise pard daalen, to bade aaraam se har kahani aapako apane bachapan main jarur le jaaegi or aapako yaad aaenge apane chhutpan ke din

 org / In private hospitals, if the beds of patients coming from economically weaker sections of the EWS are left vacant, then the government will not approve this
 darasal dilli ke 41 privet aspataalon main EWS marijon ke muft ilaaj ke liye 623 bed hai jinamein zyaadaatar 30 se 40 fisadi hi marijon ko mil pate hai
 In admitting such patients, the private hospitals take out Meenamekh and hence the government has decided that now the government hospitals will also be able to refer the patients
 dilli sarkaar ke swasthya mantri satyendra jain ne kaha ki swasthya vibhaag 85 pesheynt welfare officer bhi niyukt karegaa jo privet aspataalon par nazar rakhenge
 Apart from 41 hospitals, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Sarita Vihar has 239 beds for EWS patients, out of which 90 per cent remain vacant due to the fact that the beds are available but the patient has to pay for the treatment
 ye maamla abhi supreme court main he par jabatak faisla nahin aa jaataa rajya sarkaar ne yahaan dawa dukaan kholane kaa faisla kiya he jahaan garib marijon ko dawaaen 80 percent discount par milengi
 Ashok Aggarwal, member of the EWS Patient Monitoring Committee, said that the government has even decided that those who cannot afford medicine and other expenses at Apollo will also bear the same expenses
 sarkaar ke mutabik EWS cote ke bed khaali rakhkar nijee aspataal salanaa kareeb 75 karod kii kamai karte hai
 One important reason for this is that patients do not get the right information about their rights
 ashok agarwal bataate hai ki kisi garib ke paas koi bhi document naa ho to wo diclaration form bhar kar de de
 Enough
 or ye form bhi privet aspataal degaa

 According to a report by the World Health Organization, apples and some other fruits are treated with pesticides, so that they do not cause fungus and insects

 Fruits and vegetables are well washed at home

 a Harvard University study found that women who are undergoing fertility treatment and consuming more of these fruits and vegetables are less likely to become pregnant or give birth to a live baby
 is study ke mutabik, agar koi mahila falon or subjiyon ke jariye zyada pastisids kii maatra le rahi he to jinda bachche ko janm dene kii sambhaavna 26 pratishat kam ho jaati he
 a researcher used bleach, water, and baking soda to remove the pesticide residue phosphates and thiabendazole
 iske aadhaar par unhone ek study prakashit kii he
 According to the study, baking soda was most effective in removing pesticides as pasticides degrade in baking soda
 jabaki bleech ko mukhyat: bacteria ko maarane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 However, no method of removing pesticides was 100 percent effective

 He started listening and obeying his orders
 pita kaa asar ab us par aisa tha ki wo unki awaz bhi hoobahoo nikaalane laga
 Lalit claimed that the deceased father Bhopal Singh kept in touch with the whole family through him
 Police Lalit kept writing every order of his father in the registers which have been recovered from the house
 bhaatia parivaar ko bhi lalit ke in ahsaason par andhaa bharosa tha, isliye wo lalit ke bataae anusaar hi kaam karte the
 One day Lalit's father also ordered him to meet the family

 # vivoipledition # iplopeningceremony There is a cash crisis in many parts of the country
 kuch jagahon par maujuuda halaaton kii tulana notebandi se kii ja rahi he
 Now the news has come that the entire NCR region including the capital of the country can also face the cash crisis in the coming days
 isaki vajah bataai ja rahi he ki pichley chah dinon se ensiaar ke bainkon or atm main cash kii supplai nahin hui he
 a month ago, the Reserve Bank of India prohibited more cash transfers from one circle of banks to another
 ensiaar ke bainkon kaa kahana he ki is samay use arabiai kii ore se use 200 or 100 ke note muhaiyaa karaae ja rahe hai
 Banks say leave 2000 notes, 500 notes are coming in very small quantities
 yahaan par aakhri baar pichley buudhvaar ko cash supplai kiya gaya tha or isamen bhi jitani in bainkon ko jarurat hoti he, unka keval 30 fisadi hi diya gaya tha
 8% of atms empty, increased in these states According to the crisis, at present eight percent of all atms across the country do not have cash
 is samay desh main kul atm ke 25 fisadi atm state bank of india ke paas hai or uske bhi 16 fisadi atm main paisa nahin he
 Due to the festive season, once again lines have been started at atms and banks to withdraw cash
 sabase zyada uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, bihar, jharkhand, gujarat ke bainkon or atm main cash kii dikkat saamne aa rahi he or ab kaha ja rahaa he ki dilli, gajiabad, noida or gudgaanv bhi isaki chapet main aa sakate hai
 Finance Minister said - There is no shortage of cash, however, on Tuesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has presented a clarification on behalf of the government on the cash crisis
 jetali ne kaha he ki unhone puri sthiti kii samiksha kii he or is samay desh main cash kii kami nahin he
 He has said that this problem has arisen due to sudden demand increase in some places
 vittamantri ne mangalvaar ko twit kiya, maine desh kicash samasya kii samikshaki he
 There is a sufficient amount of cash in the market and banks
 jo ekadam dikkatein saamne ai hai wo isliye he kyonki kuch jagahon par achaanak cash kii maang badi he
 RBI said- After the finance minister on the problem of a few days' cash crisis, now the statement of RBI has also come
 arabiai ne kaha he ki desh main cash kaa koi sankat nahin he
 Banks have a sufficient amount of cash
 sirf kuchhetiem main hi logistic samasyake kaaran ye sankat paidaa ho gaya he
 RBI said that in addition to atms, there is also a lot of cash in bank branches
 arabiai ne sabhi bainkon ko aadesh diya he ki vah atm main cash kii vyavastha kare
 RBI has said that this type of problem occurs during march-april last year also
 ye samasya sirf ek-do dinon ke liye hi he
 Suppose you are listening to a beautiful relaxing song
 sangeet ke saath-saath gane ke bol bhi shahad kii tarah aapke zehan or dil main ghulte ja rahe hai
 Then a word of Urdu comes and you start looking at your armpits
 kisi ek line kaa matlab na samaj paaen to lagata he ki kuch adhuraa rah gaya he
 We are giving you the meaning and context of Urdu words which are often used in Bollywood songs
 ye shabd kathin nahin hai, hameshaa aapke aas-paas hi hote hai, phir bhi bahut saare log inkaa matlab nahin jaanate
 Hopefully, not only will you be able to understand the songs better, but the next time a friend gets stuck on a word like 'khalish', 'ibadat' or 'bekhadi', you will be able to boast of your 'knowledge'
 shabd number 1: khalishmatlab:chubhansandarbh:khalish kaa matlab chubhan kii samvednaa se he
 It is used more in emotional contexts but also in the context of love separation
 shabd sikh zarur lijie, lekin khyaal rakhiegaa ki 21veen sadi main koi aapako pin chubhaaye or aap kahen ki khalish ho rahi he to maamla zaraa haasyaaspad ho jayega
 Song: Bin Tere, Bin Tere Koi Khalish Hai, Bin Tereshbad No 2 in the Winds: Inayatmatlab: Kripa, mehrabanisandarbh: It is clear from the meaning of the word, a polite way to show favor to someone
 film 'saat khun maaf' main sadabahaar gulzaar likhte hai, 'ek zaraa cheharaa udhar kije, inayat hogi
 i have been holding my breath for a long time
 'gaanaa:shukriya aapaki inayat kaa mehabashabd number 3: bekudimtalab:dimag kaa viraag, man phiraav, besudhi, bekabarisandarbh:'be-khudi' yani khud se mukt
 Just understand that if someone falls in love, then in the stage of his realization he goes into 'senselessness'
 yani apni sud-budh kho baithta he
 It is mostly used in positive contexts, but lyricists have also used negative senselessness
 zaahir he, aadmi pyaar ke saath avsaad ke samay main bhi bekhud ho hi saktaa he
 Song: Sanam in Bekhudi, Woke up who went to Kadamaya, Aaye, Aaye Paas Hamabard Number 4: Rabtamtalab: Relationship, connectedness, liaison, contact: Reference: If two people are mutual 'rabta', then understand that there is some connection between the two
 matlab puraane pyaar kaa koi ehsaas agar ankaha rah gaya ho to use 'rabta' kaha ja saktaa he
 It is one of the most popular interpretations, it can be used in many contexts
 gaanaa:kuch to he tujhse rabtashabd number 5: qurbatmatlab:kareebi, rishtedaari, taalluksandarbh:simple he
 In Urdu, intimacy between two people is called qurbat
 qareeb or qurbat ek hi parivaar ke shabd hai
 Do not confuse
 gaanaa:mujhe kuch pal de qurbat ke, fakir ham teri chahat ke (yaa ali, raham ali)teri qurbat se bhi ab kisi rah sakuungi juda, ye nigahon kii baahon main aao naa (tu hi re) The Uddhav government got 169 votes in the floor test, the day before the BJP made a ruckus in the House Uddhav government in Maharashtra has passed the floor test
 bahumat pareekshan main kul 169 vot uddhav sarkaar ke paksh main pade
 At the same time, there was not a single vote in the opposition
 voting ke dauraan kul 4 vidhayak tatasth rahe, jabaki emenes ne sarkaar ke paksh main vot nahin kiya
 However, earlier in the House, the BJP fiercely cut the ruckus
 purv siem devendra fadanvis ne bahumat pareekshan or uddhav thakare ke shapath ko samvidhan ke khilaaf bataaya
 The BJP walked out in the midst of a majority test
 aise main pehle hi din uddhav ko fadanvis ke sakht tevar dekhne pade
 However, amidst the uproar, CM Uddhav Thackeray went to the chair of the Leader of Opposition to hug former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 uddhav ne fadanvis ko gale lagaaya
 The Uddhav government passed the floor test, 169 mlas gave support to the governor
 As soon as the complaint started, Fadnavis said that why did the house not start with Vande Mataram
 is par bijepi kheme se hooting hone lagi
 Fadnavis said that whenever a floor test occurs, it happens after the appointment of the first regular speaker
 isliye niyamon ko taak par rakhkar protem spikar chunaa or floor test karaayaa
 He said that the assembly which does not run according to the constitution, we cannot participate in it
 samvidhan ke niyamon ko ulanghan hua he, isliye rajyapal ko yah kaarywahi radd kerani chahie
 We will go to the Governor and give him a letter of irregularity
 protem spikar ko kyon badla gaya ?fadanvis ne kaha ki jab tak nae spikar kii niyukti nahin hoti tab tak protem spikar kaa rahanaa jaruri he
 Why the Protem Speaker was replaced
 agar yah vahi adhiveshan chal rahaa he to protem spikar kyon badla gaya
 this is wrong
 yah desh ke itihaas main kabhi nahin hua
 What was feared or needed was that the Protem Speaker was changed
 spikar ke chunaav se pehle floor test nahin kiya ja saktaa
 a motion of confidence cannot be brought until a permanent speaker is appointed
 protem spikar ne khaarij kar diya dawaapurv mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii aguwai main bhaajapa sadasyon ne kaha ki do-divasiy vishesh satr kaa aayojan niyamon kaa ulanghan he
 However, Protem Speaker Dilip Valsay Patil dismissed the bjp's objection, saying that the special session was being organized as per the directions of Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari
 floor test main mila samarthanmaharashtra vikaas aghadi ko 169 vidhayakon kaa samarthan mila
 In which 56 members of Shiv Sena, 54 of NCP, 44 of Congress, 2 of SP, one of Swabhimani Shetkari, 3 of Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, one of PWP and 10 Independent mlas voted in favor of Uddhav government
 isamen ensipi ke ek vidhayak ko protem spikar bana diya gaya tha, is vajah se 169 vidhayakon ne vot daalaa

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke netritv vaali centre sarkaar ne savarna jatiyon ko aarthik aadhaar par 10 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa faisla kiya he
 Economically weaker upper caste people will be given 10 percent reservation in government jobs
 sarkaar mangalvaar ko samvidhan main sanshodhan prastaav laaegi or uske aadhaar par aarakshan diya jayega
 In fact, according to the current rules of the constitution, the path of providing reservation on economic grounds is quite difficult
 kya kahata he samvidhan?samvidhan ke anusaar, aarakshan kaa paimaana saamaajik asamanta he or kisi kii aay or sampatti ke aadhaar par aarakshan nahin diya jaataa he
 According to Article 16 (4) of the Constitution, reservation is given to a group and not to an individual
 is aadhaar par pehle bhi supreme court kai baar aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene ke faislon par roak laga chukaa he
 In its rulings, the Supreme Court has said that reservation on economic grounds is a violation of the fundamental right to equality
 kise milegaa 10% savarna aarakshan kaa phayda, ye he categorykub-kab hua he khaarij?- april, 2016 main gujarat sarkaar ne saamaanya varg main aarthik rup se pichde logon ko 10 pratishat aarakshan dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 According to this decision of the government, it was said that families with annual income less than 6 lakh rupees will be brought under this reservation
 haalanki agast 2016 main hoicourt ne ise gaiyrkanoonee or asanvaidhanik bataaya tha
 - In September 2015, the Rajasthan government promised 14 per cent reservation in the educational institutions and government jobs to the economic backward classes of the unreserved class
 haalanki disambar, 2016 main rajasthan hoicourt ne is aarakshan bill ko radd kar diya tha
 The same thing happened in Haryana
 - 1978 main bihar main pichhadon ko 27 pratishat aarakshan dene ke baad tatkaaleen mukhyamantri karpuri thakur ne aarthik aadhaar par savarnon ko teen fisadi aarakshan diya tha
 However, the court later scrapped the system
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar kaa bada elaan, savarna jatiyon ko milegaa 10% aarakshan- 1991 main mandal kamishan report lagu hone ke thik baad purv pradhanmantri narsingh raav ne aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan diya tha or 10 pratishat aarakshan kii vyavastha kii thi
 However, in 1992, the court quashed it
 sarkaar ke saamne kya he chunauti?darasal sarkaar ke saamne ise lagu karne main kai chunautiyaan hai, jinhen samvidhan main sanshodhan kar dur karnaa hoga
 The first is that the Supreme Court has fixed the reservation limit to 50 percent and the Constitution does not provide for reservation on economic grounds
 doosraa yah he ki samvidhan ke anuchhed 15 or 16 main keval saamaajik or shaikshanik rup se pichde hone kii baat he
 However, even to make any changes in the constitution, it will be difficult for the government to get a majority from both the houses
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar sansad main aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kii nai shrenee ke praavdhaan vaala vidheyak laa sakati he
 How much reservation to whom now? In the year 1963, the Supreme Court had said that generally more than 50 percent reservation cannot be given

 At the same time, he is now supporting singer Abhijeet, who has been suspended from Twitter for tweeting the controversy

 They also raised some questions and listed their reasons for leaving this social platform
 sonu nigam ne apana gussa jaahir karte hue likhaa ki kuch log mere is kadam se behad khush honge
 He also wrote that in this country, sleeping people have the freedom to wake up, but no one can say anything to those pretending to sleep

 trump ne kaha tha ki jab se kim jong un ourchinke raashtrapati shi jinping kii mulaakaat hui he, tabhi se north korea ke swabhaav main badlaav aayaa he
 There was every possibility of a meeting earlier, but North Korea has suddenly become aggressive
 trump ne kaha ki shi jinping bahut achche pokar player hai, main kisi par aarope nahin laga rahaa hum
 But it is true that Kim's attitude has changed only after his second meeting with Jinping
 aapako bataa den ki jab se donon deshon ke netaaon kii baithak kii baat saamne ai thi
 Since then, the United States was continuously pressurizing North Korea to stop its nuclear programs
 north korea ne bhi vaada kiya tha ki vah jald hi parmaanu pareekshan ke kaaryakramon ko radd kar degaa
 But later a statement from North Korea was issued saying that if unilateral pressure was made by the US on nuclear weapons, the talks could be canceled
 in teji se badalte ghatnakramon ke bich ab 12 june ko trump or kim jong un ke bich mulaakaat singapore main honi tay he
 The whole world is keeping its eye on it
 ab yah dekhnaa hoga ki vastav main yah mulaakaat ho paati he yaa nahin

 i said Sir, if i had a car that i was not

 maine unke kahe anusaar vahiin daalanavaala thane main unke saamne hi press conference main apni or unki baton ko bol diya, kyonki iske alaava mere paas koi chaara nahin tha
 After this, D
 came from Delhi
 si
 P
 sahab mujhe apni pizero gaadi main bithakar raat ko kareeb 12 baje dilli pahunch gaye or apane krime branch ke offis main le gaye
 The next day, presenting me in court and taking me on remand for questioning
 remand par police waalon ne mujhse poocha ki ab is baat kaa faisla to jaj sahab karenge ki tumne phulan ko maaraa yaa nahin, lekin jisane bhi maaraa thik kiya, kyonki usne apane jivan main sau se bhi zyada logon kii hatya bina kisi kaaran kar rakhi thi
 Those who say that Phoolan was tortured and to avenge her, she became a dacoit and murdered people, it is completely wrong to believe and think so
 maine unase kaha ki sar, phulan devi khud apni ichha se daakuon ke saath rahane ke liye gai thi or agar un daakuon ne phulan ke saath sex kiya to yah un logon kaa maahaul tha or daakuon kaa har giroh apane gang main 3-4 auraton ko isliye rakhata hi tha ki vah unke saath rangareliyaan manaa sake, kyonki daaku har samay bihadon main hi rahete the
 These women also helped in cooking the gang
 isliye har giroh apni aavashyaktaa anusaar apane gang main aurat rakhata tha
 The gang that had Phoolan Devi, the head of that gang, were two brothers, named Shriram and Lalaram
 phulan devi kaa yah kahana he ki shriram or lalaram ne uske saath balaatkaar or atyaachaar kiya
 If this is considered by Phoolan Devi, Phoolan Devi should have avenged the atrocities inflicted on her by killing these two brothers and if Phoolan had killed them, i would have been the biggest supporter of Phoolan, because then it is truly bravery that You taught a lesson to the person who oppressed you
 lekin phulan in donon bhaaiyon ko kabhi nahin maar pai
 The only mistake that Phoolan Devi murdered in Behmai village together with her gang was that a man from this village had invited these two dacoit brothers for the wedding ceremony of their home
 or ye 22 log bhi us shaadi samaaroh main shaamil the
 These 22 people will not even know why they are dying
 Even if Phoolan were to kill the man who invited him, Phoolan could be said to be right that whoever supports our opponent, we will harm him
 lekin in garib 22 logon kii to koi dur-dur tak kii galati nahin thi
 Phoolan or people say that when Phoolan was raped, why did not these villagers save him, then i say on this point that if they were brave enough to save someone from bandits, then they should die Would not have saved iske alaava phulan ne pachisiyon dakaiti maari or har dakaiti ke samay paison kii laalach main 2-3 hatyaein hameshaa apane gang kaa rob jamaane ke liye kin
 Phoolan's enemies were Shriram and Lalram Rajput, so Phoolan openly said that i will kill all the Kshatriyas from the whole earth and finish them
 phulan devi se koi puche ki do logon kii galati kaa khamiyaja vah puraa samaaj kyun bhugtegaa, jisane is desh kii seva main apana sab kuch lagaaya ho
 Later when Phoolan surrendered, Shri Arjun Singh was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh at that time and in front of him Phoolan surrendered
 shri arjuna singh khud rajput netaa the
 If Phoolan was so hated by the Rajputs, then why surrender to Shri Arjun Singh? Just because Arjun Singh had accepted all the illegal conditions of Phoolan and according to these conditions, the government was giving a lot of land and property in lieu of surrender to Phoolan, which was the purpose of Phoolan's life
 The money could be earned and due to this greed she became a dacoit and when the greed of that money was seen to be fulfilled by surrender, she surrendered
 agar shriram lalaram se vah itani nafrat karti thi ki us nafrat main usne sau se bhi zyada logon kii hatyaein kar deen to saansad banane ke baad jab uske paas power tha to police kii sahaayta se unako or unke gang ko khatm kyon nahin k ravaaya? sirf isliye ki uskaa dushmani se koi vaasta hi nahin tha, kyonki uskaa makasad sirf paisa tha, jo usne tab bhi khub dakaitiyaan daalkar kamaaya, jab vah dakait thi or ab bhi kama rahi thi, jab vah saansad thi
 Phoolan earned at least more than 20 crores property wrongly after becoming an MP and forgot the backward castes she had won by promising to help and remember only money
 sirf paisa, jo uske liye sab kuch tha
 After knowing my thoughts about Phoolan Devi, the policemen sitting in front of me also agreed with me and one of them said that it is strange that in 1982, how many policemen like us to catch Phoolan alive or dead One must have been done day and night to get the reward of 50 thousand which was given by Phoolan when he was caught alive or dead, and today when someone has killed him, then to reward him Has to be sent to jail after being caught
 xxrep 5 * phir ek afasar ne mujhe english kaa hindustan times diya, jisamen yah khabar chhapi hui thi ki uttar pradesh ke jalon jile main phulan ke marane ke baad logon ne hawa main goliyaan chalaa kar khushiyaan manaayi or behamai cond ke kareeb 20 saal baad ilaake main diwaali kaa tyohaar manaaya jayega
 There were also reports of celebrating happiness everywhere in Uttar Pradesh to commemorate Phoolan's death
 xxrep 5 * jailer ne mujhase kaha phulan ko maarane ke liye tuune ek-do karod to liye hi honge
 i said, Sir, i am not a man who works for money
 main deshbhakt aadmi, or apane desh or samaaj ke liye apane ghar se paise kharch karke kaam k rane vaala aadmi baaki rahi baat aapkaa acha karne kii to main koi murga nahin, lekin main aapke liye apni ichha se baad main kuch-na-kuch karuunga, kyonki aap mere kahe anusaar meraa kaam kar dete ho
 xxrep 5 * The next day i was presented in the court that either my mother had met outside the court with 100-200 Rajput Sabha members

 Five years before the assassination of former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, in 1991, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) prepared a report on it
 siie ne is behad vistrut or sampurna report taiyaar main yah andaja lagaaya tha ki agar rajeev gandhi kii hatya ho jaati he yaa phir vah achaanak raajnneetik paridrishy se chale jate hai tab kya hoga
 The 23-page report titled 'india after Rajiv' was placed before other senior CIA officers in March 1986 for their comments
 siie ne haal main is reportco saarvajanik kiya he
 However, some parts of this report have been removed
 rajeev ke piem rahete unpar hoga jaanaleva hamalaa: ciaisa report kaa puraa sheershak uplabdh nahin he, kyonki iske kuch hisse hataa die gaye hai
 This report was prepared based on the information available with the CIA till January 1986
 uplabdh report (hataai nahin gai) kii sabase pehali line main kaha gaya he, pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi par 1989 main kaarykaal samaapt hone se pehle kam se kam ek baar hamalaa hoga, jiske safal hone kii ashanka he
 He later stated clearly, there is a great risk of his being killed in the near future
 iske paanch saal baad gandhi kii 21 may 1991 main tamilnadu ke shreeperambudur main hatya kar di gai thi
 This report analyzes and deliberates on the situation after Rajiv's departure
 If Rajiv Gandhi is not there, if there is a sudden change in leadership, then what is likely to happen in the domestic and international political situation and its What impact could it have on India's relations with the US, the then Soviet Union and the region
 rajeev kii hatya ke baad dange bhadakne kii jataai ashankamerica khufia agency is report main us samay vibhinn ativaadee samoohon se rajeev kii jaan ko khatre kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he or unki hatya kii ashanka jataai gai he
 It states that if a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim kills Gandhi, communal violence can spread on a large scale despite strong security measures, including the deployment of army and paramilitary forces in northern India by the President of India
 narsingh raav or veepi singh kaa bhi zikradilachasp baat yah he ki is report main pivi narsingh raav or veepi singh kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he, jo rajeev ke achaanak jane ke baad antarim rup se kaarybhaar sambhaal sakate hai yaa sambhavit ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 Rao took over as Prime Minister in 1991
 'hatya kaa khatra: khatre main sthirataa' sheershak vaale khand main bataaya gaya he ki sambhavat: ativaadee sikhon yaa asantusht kashmiri muslimon dwaara aagaamee kai varshon main rajeev kii hatya karne kii ashanka he
 Apart from these, any hardcore Hindu can also target them
 report main LTTE ke zikr kaa pataa nahireport ke is khand kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa chunki hataa diya gaya he, isliye yah saaf nahin ho sakaa he ki vishleshan main srilanka ke tamil kattarpathiyon kaa zikr kiya gaya tha yaa nahin
 In another section, however, Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve the dispute between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated Colombo government have been talked about in detail and in depth
 rajeev gandhi kii hatya kii ashanka ke alaava report main varsh 1989 se pehle bharat ke raajnneetik patal se unke achaanak hatane kii sthiti main sambhavit taur par paidaa hone vaale vibhinn raajnneetik paridrishyon kaa bhi vishleshan kiya gaya he
 The report states that, although we believe that Rajiv's term may end due to the murder in the near future, several other factors may also cause his abrupt withdrawal from the political table before 1989
 rajeev ke piem pad se istife kaa bhi tha anumaanis report main saath hi kaha gaya he ki swaabhaavik tareeke se yaa durghatana main rajeev kii maut ho sakati he
 Apart from this, many other factors have also been mentioned
 america agency kii report main unke naaraaz hokar istipha dene ke faisle kii kisi bhi sambhaavna se inkaar kiya gaya he
 The report said, we are not seeing any sign of this and believe it would be contrary to their nature
 usamen saath hi kaha gaya he, hamen ashanka he ki rajeev anumaan laga rahe honge (jaisaa ki ham laga rahe hai) ki saarvajanik pad chhodane par bhi vah or unke parijan kattarpanthi hinsa ke nishane par rahenge
 The impact of Rajiv's departure on America's relationship with the US said in the section titled Impact on America, we believe that Rajiv's death will be a major setback to American interests
 report main saath hi kaha gaya he, hamaara maananaa he ki rajeev kii hatya ke baad gharelu raajnneeti main parivartan ke kaaran bharat-america sambandh bhi prabhavit honge
 The report assesses Rajiv's policies and their outcome on a range of issues, including dealing with radicals, relations with other countries (including Sri Lanka's Tamil issue), promoting the acquisition of select foreign technologies
 report main kaha gaya he, haalanki pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii nitiyon kaa agle kuch varshon ke dauraan jamkar virodh hoga, lekin hamaara maananaa he ki maut ko chhodkar disambar 1989 ke vartmaan kaarykaal tak bhartiya raajnneeti main unka dabadabaa kaayam rahegaa
 The CIA report spoke of the possibility of a national government replacing Rajiv in the event of his sudden departure from the Indian political scene
 report main aisi kisi bhi paristhiti main haalanki sainya shashan kii sambhaavna se inkaar kiya gaya he

 Ishant, who could not play in Mohali test because of the ban, has said that he wants to focus on the future
 unhone kaha, ‘jindagi main kai baar ham peeche mudakar dekhte hai or puraani baton ko yaad karte hai or sochate hai ki yadi main aisa karata yaa nahin karata to chijen bhinn hoti
 There is no answer to this
 jab mujh par mohali test kaa pratibandh laga to maine faisla kiya ki main peeche mudakar nahin dekhuunga
 What happened in Sri Lanka is a thing of the past and i do not want to think about that
 ’srilanka main kahaan shuru hua jhagadasrilankai daure main apane gusse ke kaaran eshanth ko kai purv cricketron kii aalochana jhelni padi thi
 During this tour, he also had a fight with Dhammika Prasad
 eshanth ne kaha, ‘dhammika prasad mere liye bounsar kar rahaa tha
 You can only do two bouncers in an over but he also does a third
 main jaanata tha ki vah aisa isliye kar rahaa he kyonki gendbaaji karte samay maine uske haath par lagaai thi
 "he said," Whatever he did when he did the third bouncer, i only told him that you bowled so slowly that i could put on my helmet
 vah gussa ho gaya or srilanka ke anya khilaadiyon ne bhi uskaa saath diya
 From here the matter heats up and when i came for bowling it had an impact
 ’eshanth ne kaha, ‘tej gendbaaj hone ke kaaran khud ko urjavan banaae rakhane or kuch hasil karne ke liye aapako kuch karnaa padataa he
 It was such a moment for me
 main jaanata hum ki kai log sochate honge ki maine jo kiya vah bahut galat tha kyonki mujh par pratibandh laga
 i was not banned because of my clash with Prasad, for which everyone was criticizing me
 mujh par pratibandh isliye laga kyonki maine ballebaaj ko out karne ke baad uske paas jaakar jashn manaaya
 it is not allowed
 utsaah main aisa ho gaya
 Talking about the changes in his technique to become a better bowler, Ishant said that he is now focusing on bowling more and bowling with shorter run ups
 unhone kaha, ‘maine apni gendbaaji par bahut kaam nahin kiya
 i am only bowling more
 sabhi kehete hai ki tej gendbaajon ko asia main wicket nahin milenge or yahaan kii pichen spinneron ke anukool hoti he
 But there are some times when nothing happens and wickets are not found easily
 tab ek tej gendbaaj hone ke naate aapako khud se kahana padataa he ki mujhe apane captain ke liye wicket lenaa hoga
 For this you need confidence
 maine apana adhik gendbaaji karke ise hasil kiya
 Ishant said, 'I cut my run up a little bit because i didn't feel comfortable when i ran
 kuch cheez kii kami khalati thi
 i was also doing many no balls
 ran ap chota karne ke baad main adhik sahaj mahasoos karata hum or no ball kii sankhya main bhi kami ai he
 Your bowling rhythm itself improves when you feel comfortable in your run up

 14 march ko vidhansabha ke gheraav ke dauraan chotil hue ghode shaktimaan kii murti ko lekar siyasat chali, jo 20 april ko chal basaa
 The Harish Rawat government installed a statue of Shaktimaan on Assembly Tirahe on 10 July, but then suddenly it was removed from there on the night of 11 July
 bijepi ne ise mudda banaaya, to harish ravat ko safai deni padi ki murti sahi samay par lagegi
 But a second case is also going on
 bijepi ke purv rajyasabha sadsy tarun vijay kii ore se haridwar main tamil kavi or sant tiruvalluvar kii pratimaa sthapit karne ko lekar raajnneeti jari he
 This quarrel grew so much that even the Chief Ministers and Prime Ministers of the two states had to jump into it
 tarun vijay 29 june ko harki paudi main is pratimaa ko sthapit karne vaale the
 The Thiruvalluvar Ganga Pawanam Yatra, which started from South India, was to reach Haridwar on the same day

 But the Mahasabha, the pilgrimage of the Pandas of Haridwar, did not allow the platform to be established for its establishment
 23 june ko pehle harki paudi par chabutara banavaane kii koshish ko pandon ne naakaam kiya
 Later, on the night of 28th, the platform was stopped by saints and sages to establish it at Shankaracharya Chowk
 in tamaam vivaadon ke bich 29 june ko murti kaa anaavaran kar vahiin ise haridwar ke damkothi sthit atithigrih main rakhwa diya gaya
 Seeing the controversy, the Governor and Chief Minister of Uttarakhand did not attend the program
 yuva ganga tirth purohit mahasabha ke ujjwal pandit kaa tark tha ki yadi aaj is murti ko ganga ghat par lagane diya gaya to kal koi or aakar apane devtaa yaa mahapurush kii murti lagane ko kahegaa
 Then a fair will be held here and the place will be occupied
 haridwar main ab jagah nahin bachi he
 The tirtha priests argued that they were not opposing the saint Thiruvalluvar, but objected to the importance of the place and lack of space
 lekin jab bina murti ko sthapit kiye anaavaran kii khabar tamilnadu ke televijan channelon par chali to vahaan ise lekar aakrosh failane laga
 There political parties made it an issue
 kaiyon kaa to yah kahana tha ki haridwar kaa brahman varg murti sthapana kaa virodh isliye kar rahaa he kyonki unka maananaa he ki tiruvallavur dalit jati se the
 On the condition of not disclosing his name, some pilgrims are blaming Tarun Vijay on the contrary
 unhen lagata he ki tarun vijay ne hi dakshin main yah galat sandesh prasaarit kiya he, taaki uttar or dakshin ke bich vivaad kii sthiti utpann ho
 The lobby of IAS and IPS officers associated with the southern states posted in Uttarakhand has also been mobilized regarding the statue
 haridwar ke ek sant kehete hai, ''yah aashcharya kii baat he ki jis sant kaa uttarakhand sahit puure uttar bharat se kabhi koi naata nahin rahaa, uski murti lagane ko lekar itnaa bada vivaad khadaa ho gaya he
 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa also wrote a letter to the Prime Minister on 20 July, seeking intervention in setting up the statue
 unhone mukhyamantri harish ravat ko bhi patr likhaa
 Rawat understood the matter of the case and hurriedly sent the Urban Development Secretary to Haridwar to find a place to place the idol
 unhone haridwar main mela bhawan parisar main murti lagane kaa suzav diya
 On July 23, Rawat performed Bhumi Pujan and laid the foundation stone for the installation of the statue in the fair building complex
 unka kahana he ki agast ke pehle saptaah main murti kii sthapana kaa bhavy samaaroh kiya jayega
 Tarun Vijay, who is struggling for the installation of the idol, says, "this will increase unity from Kanyakumari to the Ganges
 yah uttar-dakshin ke bich samanvay kaa kaam karegi
 "opposition is feeling that Harish Rawat now wants to take credit for this too
" lekin hakeekat yah he ki rashtriya ekta kii misaal banane vaali yah murti ab ek siyaasi mudda ban gai he

 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main gatchiroli seat par pichley kuch maheenon se adivasee or gaiyr adivaasiyon ke bich vibhaajan ko dekha ja rahaa tha or chunaav ke nattejey aane ke saath hi yah spasht bhi ho gaya kyonki is seat par gaiyr adivaasiyon ne jam kar nota vot daale
 a total of 17,510 NOTA votes were cast here, which came third after winning BJP candidate Dr
 Devrao Holi and second-placed Congress candidate Atram Dharmarababa
 gauratlab he ki maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main kul 4,83,459 nota vot daale gaye hai
 Talking about the vote percentage, this 0 of the total Vaidya votes
 9 fisadi he
 The biggest reason behind this is being persuaded by OBC leaders of Gadchiroli not to vote for any established political party candidate
 unka yah kahana he ki adivasee bahul is vidhansabha kshetra ke gaiyr adivaasiyon ke saath matbhed ho rahaa he or unhen aam suvidhaayen jaise sarkari naukariyon se bhi vanchit rakhaa ja rahaa he
 However, despite this decision, this time the BJP candidate won all the three assembly seats here
 gatchiroli ke alaava armori seat par 4,162 nota vot pade jo aathven sthaan par he jabaki aheri seat par pade 7,349 voton ke saath nota chauthe sthaan par rahaa
 Strangely, the number of non-tribals here is more than 60 percent, but these are all tribal seats and no major party takes away the candidates of non-tribals here
 itnaa hi nahin, sarkari naukari main obisi kota bhi 2002 ke baad 19 fisadi se ghatakar 6 fisadi par aa gaya he
 Due to not having a factory in this district, the people here are completely dependent on government jobs
 rajyapal ke haal hi main aae nirdesh ke baad chaturth or tritiy virgon kii sari naukariyaan (jaise anganbari) adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit ho gaye hai
 So in such a situation the resentment of non-tribals is bound to be seen

 "he points out that the company has partnered with ICICI Lombard, the leading non-life insurer in the private sector, to provide accident insurance to driver partners
 jiske tahat 18 se 65 varsh kii ayuvarg ke dryver parteners ko ubar ap kaa upyog karte vakt tathaa yatra ke liye uplabdh hone par, maarg main yaa phir ubar kii trip par hone ke dauraan durghatanavash mrityu or viklaangata, hospitalijeshan tathaa output medical upachaar ke liye kawarej pradaan karata he

 jinamein dryver destination ke tahat dryver din main do baar apane destination sthapit kar sakate hai or ubar unhen apane raste main padane vaali trip ke nivedan bhejega, jisase dryver kii anuplabdhta or nirastikaran kii sambhaavnaaen bahut kam ho jaaengi
 For example, if the driver puts Connaught Place and is in Gurgaon, then he will get the request for the same rides, which are going to go from Gurgaon to CP, will not be sent in the opposite direction
 ise bhi padhein: bullate to chalaayenge, trainon kii durghatnaayen kab rukengivahin, back-tu-back trips ke tahat jab dryver kii trip puri hone vaali hogi, to use apni agali trip kaa nivedan milegaa
 This will reduce the time of the driver standing empty and riders will be able to get the car as quickly as possible
 ubar ne ek 'poj batan' pesh kiya he, taaki dryver partner bhojan, eendhan bharwane yaa phir thodi der ke liye avkaash le saken
 The heat map provides the drivers with the recommended areas where they are most likely to get the next ride based on the demand and supply of the place
 iskaa matlab he ki trip ke liye unhen kam intjaar karnaa padegaa or eendhan kii khapat bhi kam hogi

 ) On Sunday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who arrived to inaugurate the sewer line in the raw colonies of Matiala Assembly, appealed to the people not to vote for the Modi government in the Lok Sabha elections
 saath hi kejariwal dilli main congress ko vot na dene kii salaah dete bhi najar aae
 It is believed that Kejriwal has dismissed the speculation of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) joining the grand alliance against NDA
 saath hi kuch vakt se aap ke congress se gathbandhan ko lekar bhi charchaa bani hui thi
 It was believed that the vote bank of AAP and Congress in Delhi is almost the same
 aise main donon partiyon ke saath nahin aane par donon ko hi nuksaan kii ashanka jataai ja rahi thi or bijepi ko iskaa sidhaa phayda milanaa tay tha
 CM appealed to the people on Sunday, saying, 'elections are due after three months
 vot daalane jaao to dhyaan se vot daalana
 The whole country wants to defeat the Modi government today, but do not vote that half the people should give their votes to the Congress
 aisa kiya to modi phir jeet jayega
 Do not let your vote be divided, everyone should seal the broom
 'siem kejariwal ne logon se kaha ki chunaav main vot daalane jaao to yaad rakhana ki pichley 4 saal main modi sarkaar ne kaam rokane main koi kasar nahi chodi
 The Modi government has waged a war against Delhiites
 bijepi waalon ne 7 loksabhaa seat jitkar hamaari naak main dam kar diya
 If you go to vote this time, then definitely think about it
 "our government has done more than what was done in last 70-years
 Vote for those who work for Delhi, not for those who stop it, @ narendramodiwants to raze down unauthorized colonies
 We would have stopped Metro fare hike, sealing if 7 mps were from our party"-@arvindkejriwalpic
 twitter
 com / 2bhsps92wj— AAP (@aamaadmiparty)january 6, 2019aap pramukh ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi kii sarkaar dilli main ceiling karvaa rahi he
 The BJP may stop the sealing in 24 hours, but the BJP is not passing the law
 modi ji kah rahe hai ki dilliwaalon ke vot nahin chahie
 He said that i cried a lot in front of him, but the Modi government did not reduce the fare of the metro
 bijepi ko lagata he ki vah loksabhaa main haar rahi he isliye dilli main 30 lakh naam voter list se katwa die gaye
 CM Kejriwal said that BJP people from Mumbai to Gujarat had driven away the people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 thik usee tarah dilli main bijepi vaale badla le rahe hai
 According to Kejariwal, for four years, Modi ji has been sitting on the file to consolidate the raw colonies
 modi ji nesatyendra jainako daraane ke liye sibiai kii red karvaa di
 Modi travels abroad and talks about breaking up the raw colony of Delhi
 mujhe saat seat jita do, lard jaaoongaa, mar jaaoongaa, lekin kachi colony ko tuutane nahin duungaa
 Counting the achievements of the Aam Aadmi Party, Kejriwal said that the work of laying sewer in the raw colonies is being completed
 baaki partiyaan nariyal phodkar bhul jaati hai
 Many colonies in the country's capital have neither sewer nor water
 kejariwal ne aarope lagaaya ki 70 saal tak bijepi or congress ne kya kiya? pichley saadhe 3 saal main aam aadmi party ne 400 colony main pani kii pipe line or siver line pahunchaa di
 CM Kejriwal claimed that under our rule, bribery in the capital has stopped
 ham har sarkari kaam main khub paisa bachaa rahe hai

 The meeting was attended by 345 delegates from 24 countries who are religious Tibetan leaders
 isamen paas prastaav main kaha gaya he ki dalai lamas apane 'punarjanm' yani uttaradhikari ke bare main khud faisla karenge
 On Saturday, four resolutions were unanimously passed on important issues such as the rebirth of the Dalai Lama
 is baithak ke baad india today se vishesh baatcheet karte hue nirvasit tibet sarkaar ke president lobsang sangye ne kaha ki china ko 'punarjanm' jaise masale par nirnay lene kaa koi adhikaar nahin he isliye china kii communist party ko dharm ke maamle main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie
 Proposalobasang Sangye for the rebirth of the Dalai Lama said, "we have passed the proposal that the document number five issued by the Chinese government regarding rebirth in 2007 is not acceptable to us
 china ke paas punarjanm kii prakriya main hastkshepakarne kii koi vishwasaneeyata nahin he
 Document number five of the Government of China states that the Communist Party will decide the recognition of rebirth at the district level, state level and national level according to the hierarchy and their categories
 aage unka kaha, 'communist party ko dharmik maamalon main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie
 As far as the rebirth of the Dalai Lama is concerned, only the Dalai Lama will decide on this and no one else
 ' yah charchaa do vishyon ke ird gird rahi, kendriya tibeti prashasan kaa vijan 550 or dalai lamas kaa tibeti logon se sambandh

 kya kahata he prastaav?pehla prastaav dalai lamas ke lambey or swasth jivan ko lekar tha, jisamen tibeti logon dwaara dalai lamas kaa aabhaar vyakt kiya gaya
 The second proposal says that the process of rebirth will continue as long as Tibetans exist in this world
 tisare prastaav main kaha gaya ki dalai lamas or unke karyaalay kaa adhikaar bana rahegaa
 The fourth resolution said that all the members unanimously rejected the order number five of 2007 of the Chinese government
 china kahata rahaa he ki dalai lamas kaa aglaa avataran tibet main hoga
 But the Tibetan community living all over the world says that the Dalai Lama can descend anywhere, because the Chinese government can appoint a puppet leader in the name of the Dalai Lama
 dalai lamas ko dharmik aazaadee honirvasit sarkaar ke president sangye ne kaha, 'param pavandalai lamas ne spasht kar diya heki unka punarjanm ek aaazaad desh main hoga jahaan dalai lamas ko dharmik aazaadee ho
 We feel that the Dalai Lama cannot be reborn in China, where Buddhism was discouraged and monastries destroyed
 'chini raashtrapati kii bharat yatra ke thik pehle is baithak ke aayojan par sawaal karne par nirvasit sarkaar ke pramukh ne kaha ki yah mahaj 'ittefaq' he
 President Sangye said, 'it is a coincidence that the President of China is coming to India just after the General Assembly of the exiled Tibet Government
 hamane farvari main hi is baithak kaa faisla kar liya tha
 Our message is clear that the Chinese government should not interfere in the affairs of religious leaders, including the Dalai Lama
 'tibet ke masale par samaadhaan kii ummid ke sawaal par unhone kaha, 'ham tibet ke mudde kaa samaadhaan dekhnaa chahenge
 We seek genuine autonomy under the framework of the Chinese Constitution, following the middle path
 yah china sarkaar or tibet ke logon ke liye bhi jeet kii sthiti hogi
 It is a middle ground and the Chinese government should consider it for a peaceful solution to the Tibet matter

 Jammu and Kashmir witnessed a unique view in the state's politics after the dissolution of the Assembly on Wednesday
 rajya main ek-duusare ke virdohi neshnal conference ke netaa umr abdulla or piples democratic party kii mukhiya mahabuuba mufti twitor par ek duusare ke sur main sur milaate najar aae
 After the dissolution of the assembly, former CM of the state Mehbooba Mufti tweeted one after the other
 unhone rajyapal satyapal malik ke vidhansabha bhang karne ko jaldbaaji bharaa faisla bataaya
 He then wrote on Twitter, 'as a politician i used to think that i have seen everything in my 26-year career
 lekin jaisaa ki kaha jaataa he ki kabhi bhi 'nevar' nahin kahana chahie
 Despite this, i would like to thank Omar Abdullah and Ambika Soni heartily that they helped us achieve what seemed impossible
 'in my twenty six year old career as a politician, i thought i had seen it all! But like they say never say never! Nevertheless, i would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to@omarabdullahand@ambikasoni4ji for helping us achieve the seemingly impossible
 1 / 4— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti) November 21, 2018 Mehbooba's gesture was to agree to form a government in the state
 bataa den ki congress or neshnal conference ke saath hi pidipi ne milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya tha
 However, after the dissolution of the assembly, the possibility was over
 unhone duusare twit main likhaa, 'pichley paanch maheenon se, raajnneetik sahyog kii parvaah kiye bina ham is baat par raji the ki rajya vidhansabha ko turant bhang kiya janaa chahie taaki kharid farokht or dalbadal par roak lagaai ja sake
 'since the past five months, regardless of political affiliations, we shared the view that the state assembly be dissolved immediately to avert horse trading & defections
 2 / 4— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)november 21, 2018tisare twit main mahabuuba ne likhaa, 'ascharyajanak rup se hamaari maangen bhens ke aage been bajaane jaisi thim
 But who thought that the idea of a grand alliance would create such panic
 'oddly enough our pleas fell on deaf ears
 But who would have thought that the very idea of a grand coalition would give such jitters
 3 / 4— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)november 21, 2018mahabuuba mufti ne chauthe twit main likhaa, 'post script: aaj ke takneekee daur main yah kaaphi ajeeb he ki mahamahim rajyapal ke awaas main hamaara fax nahin pahunchaa, lekin unhone vidhansabha bhang karne kaa aadesh turant jari kar diya
 'PS - In todays age of technology, it is very strange that the fax machine at HE Governor's residence did not receive our fax but swiftly issued one regarding the assembly dissolution
 🤔4 / 4— Mehbooba Mufti (@mehboobamufti)november 21, 2018mahabuuba ke pehle twit ko ritvit karte hue umr ne likhaa, 'or maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki main kabhi aapse sahamat hote hue aapako ritvit karuunga, raajnneeti sach main alag tarah kii duniya he
 Good luck in the struggle ahead
 ek baar phir se logon kii budhimatta kii jeet hogi

 Now everyone's eyes are on whether Jammu and Kashmir is moving towards elections or there is some other option
 bihar main hui bijepi netaa krishna shahi kii hatya maamle kaa police ne khulaasa kar diya he
 Aditya Rai, a close aide of the BJP leader, carried out the incident
 avaidh sambandhon kii vajah se krishna shahi kii hatya kii gai
 The accused is being questioned by the police
 police ne buudhvaar ko gopalganj main bijepi netaa krishna shahi kaa shav ek kuen se baraamad kiya tha
 Police arrested Aditya Rai, close to the leader in this regard
 police poochtacha ke dauraan aditya raay ne apnajurm kabuulakar liya
 Rai told police that Krishna had illicit relations with his sister
 raay ne aage bataaya, beete dinon jab krishna unke ghar aayaa tha to vah uski bahan se phone par baat kar rahaa tha
 He had heard the conversation of both
 donon raat 12 baje aditya ke hi ghar par milane vaale the
 After which Aditya plans to kill Krishna
 aditya kitnashak kii dukaan se jehar kharid kar laayaa
 Krishna reached Aditya's house at 12 pm
 aditya ne jab darwaja kholaa to krishna police se jhagada hone kaa bahaanaa banaate hue der raat uske ghar aane kii baat kehane laga
 Fearing a police raid, he asked to stay there at night
 iske baad aditya ne krishna ko jehar mila hua khaanaa parosa
 After eating, Krishna started restless and ran out and fell into a nearby well
 aaropee ke ikbaal-e-jurm ke baad police ne uske khilaafahatya kaa kesadarj kar liya he
 At present, the investigation of the case is going on
 kya tha maamlabeete dinon gopalganj main bijepi netaa krishna shahi kaa shav kune se mila tha
 After which the police detained Aditya Rai, a close aide of the deceased leader and four women
 aditya ke ghar jane ke baad se hi mritak netaa gaayab tha
 Shahi's brother was said to be the hand of MLA Pappu Pandey in this case
 dilli main aam aadmi party or congress ke bich loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan kii gahamagahami ke bich mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke bayaan se sthiti bilkul spasht ho gai he
 Kejriwal, who arrived in East Delhi's Laxmi Nagar on Tuesday to ask for votes for Aam Aadmi Party candidate Atishi, while answering media queries after the public meeting said that according to the official information i received, the Congress has refused for an alliance
 arvind kejariwal ne aage kaha ki unki (congress kii) rojaanaa kya meeting chal rahi he usase hamen kya lenaa- dena? hamen congress aadhikarik taur par bataa chuki he ki koi gathbandhan nahin he or hamaari unase koi baat nahin chal rahi he
 Everyday, Congress is doing a story plant
 is bich 'ajtak' ne aam aadmi party ke dilli sanyojak gopal raay se congress ke saath gathbandhan ko lekar poocha ki kya dilli main congress se gathbandhan hoga? kya congress baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hui, tab bhi aam aadmi party kaa gathbandhan nahin hoga? gopal raay ne jawaab main kaha ki congress se gathbandhan nahin hoga
 The Congress is not serious, and thinking about the alliance now means losing the election
 ek-ek din khatm ho rahaa he
 The National President of the Congress lives in Delhi and the State President in Delhi, despite this, they are playing lots of letters
 isse saaf he ki congress dilli main ladaai ladane ke liye gambhir nahin he
 After so many conversations, people are also talking about how much you will talk
 congress jaanati he ki wo dilli main chunaav nahin jeet sakati balki sirf bijepi ko jita sakati he
 Gopal Rai was further asked if there was no scope for alliance with the Congress now? Rai replied "the Aam Aadmi Party has decided that candidates will contest elections on seven seats and single-handedly defeat BJP
" aam aadmi party 23 march se apana campagne shuru kar degi
 All the discussions of the alliance have now come to an end
 "'ajtak' ne gopal raay se gathbandhan kii baatcheet fail hone kii vajah poochi to unhone aarope lagaate hue kaha "congress dilli main gambhir nahin he, congress kaa ek dhada bijepi ko phayda pahunchaana chahta he
 But now it is so late that even if the coalition is formed, they will lose the election
 " raay se yah bhi poocha gaya ki kya aage gathbandhan par congress se prastaav aayaa to aam aadmi party charchaa karegi? gopal raay ne kaha ki "ham koi charchaa nahin karenge, bahut deree ho chuki he
 There will be no alliance in Delhi now
 "aapako bataa den ki dilli main 12 may ko chunaav hone hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party has declared candidates for all seven seats in Delhi
 aam aadmi party ne loksabhaa chunaav main purna rajya kii maang ko mudda banaaya he
 Terming the joining of civil society people and government on the issue of Lokpal Bill as an important step for democracy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the government wants to introduce this historic bill in the monsoon session of Parliament
 pradhanmantri ne ek bayaan main kaha, mujhe khushi he ki sarkaar or naagarik samaaj ke pratinidhi bhrashtachar se ladane ke hamaare parsparik sankalp main ek samjhaute par pahunch gaye hai
 i am happy that Anna Hazare has agreed to end the fast
 manmohan ne kaha, is aitihaasik vidheyak par naagarik samaaj or sarkaar kaa haath milaanaa hamaare loktantr ke liye ek shubh sanket he
 He said that talks between the government and Hazare's representatives were fruitful
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, mujhe ummid he ki is vidheyak ko taiyaar karne kii prakriya rachanaatmak rup se aage badhegi, taaki vyapak vichaar-vimarsh ke baad vidheyak ko monsoon satr main pesh karne ke liye mantrimandal ke samaksh rakhaa jaae
 If Faisal Devjigandhi is still present among us, the credit goes to him and only his critics, who do not let him be forgotten
 mahatma ke anuyaayiyon ne unhen sant bana diya he jisaki shikshaaon kii aasaani se andekhi kii ja sakati he—jaise kisi bade kii baton kii dur-dur se prashansa kii jaati he
 It is surprising why Gandhi is such a living personality among his critics, given the ceremonial honor given to him in India and his sense of neglect in public life
 ye aalochak shaayad ve log hai jinhen unke santatv main ai kami se lagata he ki unke saath dhokhaa hua he
 This sense of being deceived becomes new in every generation, with scholars or agitators finding some new failure of the Mahatma
 1980 ke dashak main nariwad kii duusari lahar ke dauraan mahilaon ke bare main unke vichaaron ko lekar unki khub bakhiya udhedi gai thi
 The basis of his criticism was his treatment of his wife Kasturba Gandhi and his stories of naked sleeping with young women in celibacy experiments
 lekin in mahilaon kii aawaaj ajeeb tareeke se dabaai gai he
 Manuben, who was a participant in Gandhi's experiments, has left a diary, but no critic has bothered to read it
 haalanki kabhi-kabhaar apane ghanisht logon ke prati unka ravaiya kathor hota tha, lekin yah bhi sach he ki unki kareebi rahi kai mahilaon, jaise anusuya sarabhai, mridula sarabhai, amrit cor, sarojini naidu or sushila nayyar ne saarvajanik jivan main pravesh kiya tha
 When the Mandal Commission revived the caste struggle in India in the 1990s, people's attention was drawn to Gandhi's caste prejudices
 lekin, is kram main gandhi ke khilaaf bi
 R
 ambedkar ke shabdic praharon kii yaad dilaane bhar se zyada bahut kaam nahin hua
 Here too, critics began brainstorming popular stories about the Poona Pact, how Gandhi had started a fast, protesting against the separate electoral system for the lower castes and how he had no worries about ending the plight of these castes was
 yah alag baat he ki puna pact mahaj jati kaa mudda nahin tha, balki musalamaanon, daliton or anya logon ke bich gathjod se paidaa hua mudda tha jo bharat main kisi raashtra kaa astitv hone se inkaar karata tha
 Critics of the Mahatma may agree with the views of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Ambedkar about the absence of the nation in India, but they refuse to pay attention to the reasons on which Gandhi supported caste
 ek araajaktaavaadi ke rup main mahatma ko tatkaaleen rajya vyavastha tathaa aupniveshik tantra kii apekshanuroop samaaj ke punarnirmaan kii disha main uske prayaason par shaq tha
 They felt that if Swaraj or self-government were to be born outside the state machinery, which could not be allowed to impose any national identity on Indians, then caste, villages and religious communities would be important
 isi vajah se aisi vyavasthaaon ko nakaarne ke bajaae unamem sudhaar karnaa aavashyak tha or apane inhen vichaaron ke kaaran gandhi krantikari ke bajaae ruudhivaadee bane rahe
 Ambedkar's disagreement with Gandhi began with the argument that the state has full power to change society and that is why he shook hands with Jawaharlal Nehru
 lekin unhen jald hi aisi shakti kii jyadatiyon or simaaon kaa ehsaas ho gaya or unhone cabinet se istipha dekar dharmik drushti se saamaajik parivartan ko badhaava dene par dhyaan kendrit kar diya
 His move reminds me of Gandhi's way
 puna pact ke dauraan ambedkar ko unka daawa sahi sabit karne kii chunauti dekar unhen peeche hatane ke liye majaboor karne vaale gandhi se spasht nafrat ke baavjood ambedkar ne mahatma ke satyagrah kii drudh avadharana kaa kabhi parityag nahin kiya
 If Gandhi's feminist enemies suppress the voice of women, then the enemies created by their ideas about caste eliminate the role of Muslims in it to maintain a pure Hindu debate — many of Ambedkar's arguments on issues of nationality and representation
 Who belonged to Jinnah
 ambedkar ke prati bhi agar gandhi jaisaa hi ravaiya apanaaya jaae to 'pichde' adivaasiyon or 'kattar' musalamaanon, ve jinhen alag pratinidhitiv die jane ke khilaaf the, ke bare main unke vichaar zyada kadi pratikriya karne laayak lagenge
 Ambedkar felt that his efforts to secure separate representation for the Dalits was hurt by the Muslim League's willingness to compromise the Congress at the expense of the Dalits
 aisa hi nuksaan aupniveshak rajya kii ore se bhartiya raajnneeti ko vibhajit karne ke liye adivasee pratinidhitiv ko badhaava dene se hua tha
 During Gandhi's lifetime, the arguments that his enemies raised against him were political and not personal
 ve mahatma ko aise muslim-virdohi yaa hindu-virdohi ke rup main dekhte the jo zyada jatil kathyon ke kaalpanik saakshyon kaa khandan karata tha
 Even Gandhi's assassin, acknowledging his inferiority, considered his perceived betrayal with the Hindus not to properly understand the domestic situation in an attempt to replicate the success achieved in uniting the Indian community in South Africa
 gandhi ko poonjivadi pitthu maanane vaala communiston kaa najariya jatil tha jisamen varg sangharsh ke vikaas se jude marks ke siddhanton kaa hawala diya jaataa tha
 The colonial authorities introduced a style of criticism based on unconfirmed stories and personal matters, which became characteristic of Gandhi's enemies
 ve mahatma par kisi aparaadh vishesh kaa aarope lagane ke bajaae unke har kaam or har baat ko charam paakhand bataate the
 Focusing on hypocrisy allowed the process of understanding Gandhi's words and actions as political ideology to be unimportant through half-baked quotes and conspiracies
 yah itihaas ko samajhane kii ati dakshinpanthi prakriya kaa lakshan he or unke saath vampanthi aalochakon kii mileebhagat kaa sanket karata he
 These diverse and mutually contradictory condemnations tell us more about the people who create them than the ones they are about
 gandhi vah strot ban gaye hai jahaan se bharatiyon kii har peedi apni saamaajik or rajnatik chintaaon ke parinaamon ko talash sakati he
 In this form, he is definitely the father of the nation
 aise main yah ascharyajanak nahin he ki gandhi ke vishwavyaapee punarutthan ke saath hi un par ab us naslwad ke aarope lag rahe hai jiske bhartiya ab shikaar nahin hai, balki agent ban gaye hai
 What is unprecedented about Gandhi's condemnation of racism, however, is that it is not confined to India but is taking place globally resulting in the attack or removal of statues of Mahatma in many parts of Africa
 gandhi ke khilaaf do aarope lagaae jate hai
 That they never spoke for the freedom of Africans or kept them apart from their movements
 or, yah ki ve africaiyon ko hin samajhate the or bharatiyon ko unase alag rakhana chaahate the
 But, without invitation, the Mahatma never spoke to any community of which he was not a member
 aisa isliye kyonki unhone ahimsa kii kalpana upadeshaatmak baat ke bajaae anukaraniya vyavhaar ke rup main kii thi jiskaa anukaran araajaktaavaadi saamaajik bahulata ko banaae rakhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa tha
 The South African society under Gandhi's era was such that there were separate laws for people of different races
 bhartiya visheshadhikaron kii raksha karne vaale vakil ke rup main ve us kanoonee vyavastha ko chunauti dene main asamarth the
 And, the law there also separated the identities of Indians and Africans and ensured that they could only protect the privileges of Indians
 haalanki mumkin he ki unhone bhi is nasleey algaav ko thik mana ho yaa yathaavat sweekaar kiya ho
 Nevertheless, in the ambulance corps he was leading at the time of the Bambatha rebellion, he insisted on treating wounded Zulu people as well and his political sympathy was with the Zulu people, not the British
 jab ve vakil nahin rahe, to unhone africaiyon ke bare main apmanjanak tippanee karnaa band kar diya
 In his book Satyagraha in South Africa, he has favored the Zulu people over Indians in every respect
 ant main to unhone africa-americanyon ko duniya bhar main ahimsa kaa pratinidhi hone kii sabase badi ummid ke rup main bhi dekha
 But given the legal status, the Mahatma had to fight for his fellow Indians
 unki maang dakshin africa tak simit hone ke bajaae antarrashtriya thi, jo bharat ko baadhya karti thi ki vah british samrajya main har kahin apane nagarikon kii sthiti kii raksha kare
 Although he himself has said so, it is misleading to call the first Satyagraha of the Mahatma as South African Satyagraha, because it had a direct impact on India and then on London
 dakshin africa us sangharsh main ek sthal maatr tha jisamen gandhi kii dilchaspee kenya se lekar morishas, guyana, fiji or trinidad tak puure british samrajya main bharatiyon kii sthiti main thi
 When he wished, it became a global movement and was actually successful in ending the practice of taking workers on contract from India, like the successor of the African slave system for the supply of laborers in most parts of the empire
 in sabake baavjood, shaayad gandhi naslvaadi the, lekin isaki jaankaree hamen unke dushmano se nahin milti jo unke khilaaf vyaktigat or aksar shadyantrpurn tark rakhte hue unke vichaaron kii sampoornataa ko baadhit karte hai or kai un sandarbhon kii andekhi karte hai jinamein unhone kaam kiya tha
 Even accusing Hitler of racism is meaningless, because we can understand his violence only when taking into account the intellectual justifications and historical contexts associated with it
 sant ko paapi main badal dene ke bajaae mahatma ke doston or dushmano, donon ke liye yah samay unhen samuchit rup se aitihaasik vyakti banane kaa he
