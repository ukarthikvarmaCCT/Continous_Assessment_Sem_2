 job market main badhati pratispardhaa ke kaaran job milanaa sabase zyada mushkil kaam ho gaya he lekin abhi bhi un ummidavaaron ko kahin na kahin behatar job jarur mil jaati he jo yogya hote hai
 Over time, methods of job search, test and interview have also changed
 jaaniye aisi 5 baton ke bare main jinhen apanaakar aap acha job paa sakate hai
 1
 online netwarking:job sarchakarne ke liye aap fasebuk, linkadin kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 But here you have to be a little careful
 agar aap hameshaa dusron se khud ke bare main baat karenge to dhire-dhire log aapke profile par dhyaan dena band karenge
 Online networking is like a cocktail, so use it carefully to your advantage
 2
 Personal Networking: Many people consider networking wrong, but it is not
 logon se khul kar baaten karen, apane lakshya tay karen
 Due to meeting others, your skills will also improve and help will come in time
 naukreetalashne main netwarking kaa kaaphi ahm role hota he
 3
 khud ko thodaa alag rakhen:jab aap job ke liye apnaarizumebana rahe hai to yah dhyaan rakhen ki puraani ghisi-pity baaten jo sabhi ke rigeume main hoti he, usko follow na karen
 You should try to put some things in your resume that are different from others
 4
 Interview information: When you go for an interview, do not just answer the questions but also ask some questions as per your requirement
 jaise ki intervyuu lene vaale kaa naam kya he? ve kya karte hai? intervyuu dekar nikalen to dhanyavad kahana na bhoolen
 5
 intervyuu main sidhi baat karen:intervyuu main ghumaavdaar jawaab dene se bachein
 Answer the questions directly
 agar aapse aapaki kamajori ke bare main poocha jaae to apni kamajori hi bataaen
 Some people speak too much to show themselves smart
 udhaaharan ke taur par ve zyada kaam karne ko apni kamajori bataane lagate hai
 Therefore, prepare such questions beforehand

 You can know the mood in the horoscope by the position of the fourth, seventh house and the moon
 ye bhi jaan sakate hai ki vyakti dusron kii buraai karata he athwa nahin
 If the fourth house or moon is bad and if it joins Mars or Saturn, then along with the evil of others, there is a sense of harm to them
 haath main angootha agar chota ho to bhi buraai or nuksaan pahunchane kaa bhav aata he
 What is the problem if we constantly do evil to others? - This ends the happiness of wealth and family - This weakens the Jupiter in the horoscope, so the chances of bad luck are formed
 - agar santan baadha he to yah baadha or bhi majboot hokar saamne aa jaati he
 - What happens in the mind of the person that creates an enemy sentiment for us, what happens if we deliberately try to harm someone? - jis prakaar se dusron ko pareshaan karnaa chaahate hai , usee prakaar se khud pareshaan ho sakate hai- chalate chalate jivan ekadam se ruk saktaa he , or jivan main bade apyash mil sakate hai
 Generally, in such a situation property is also seen to be destroyed
 - santan apane haathon se nikal jaati he , or santan paksh se ksht kii sambhaavna ban jaati he 
 Which planets are mainly affected by these evils? - This strengthens Rahu and Saturn, which can increase conflict - this makes Jupiter and Venus weak - and most of all it makes the Sun badly - such From habits, the color of the palms also starts turning to blackness
 If we are troubled by our own habit of doing evil to others, then what remedies should be taken? Chant Gayatri Mantra - Use yellow color more and more - Try not to consume tamasic food, especially liquor - Whenever such feeling comes, chant Gayatri Mantra if someone else does our evil and harm us
 Wanna? - Always go out of the house by bowing to Hanuman ji- Avoid contact with anyone who has such information- Offer fragrance and water to Shiva ji every morning N- and lamps a lamp of mustard oil down the people every Saturday

 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ignoring his parliamentary constituency Varanasi
 vah japan, france or kai deshon main gaye lekin varanasi ke gaanvon main jane kii unhen fursat nahin mili
 In such a situation, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has given more speculation to contest elections from Varanasi
 priyanka ne guuruuvaar raat raibareli main party kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat kii
 During this meeting, on the suggestion of an activist to contest elections from Rae Bareli, he said in a light joking manner that "should i not fight Benares"
 priyanka ne shuukravaar ko ayodhya main pradhanmantri narendra modi par apane hi sansadeey nirvachan kshetra varanasi ko paryaapt samay na dene kaa aarope lagaaya or unke kshetra varanasi se chunaav ladane kii atakalon ko or prabal kar diya
 However, Priyanka, when asked direct questions about her chances of contesting elections from Varanasi, said that if the party tells her, she is ready to contest from anywhere
 congress mahasachiv ne shuukravaar ko ayodhya main ek nukkad sabha main kaha ki centre kii purvavarti congress sarkaar ke kaarykaal main varanasi main manjuur kii gai 150 kimi lambii sadak main se sirf 15 kimi kaa hi nirmaan kiya gaya or usamen bhi badi sankhya main gadde ho gaye hai
 Priyanka, who reached Ayodhya for the first time after becoming Congress General Secretary, said that the people of Varanasi are witness that the Prime Minister did not go to the rural areas of his own parliamentary constituency during his nearly 5-year tenure
 vah america, china, japan or africa samet baaki puri duniya gum aae, lekin unhen apane hi kshetra ke liye samay nahin mila
 This is a big deal
 kyonki isse pataa chalata he ki is sarkaar kaa dil udyogpatiyon ko or amir banane main laga he, garibon kaa utthan karne main nahin
 Priyanka Vadra constantly attacked the BJP and said that "the people of BJP have made a complete plan to destroy the Constitution, democracy and institutions"
 samvidhan or loktantr janata ko majboot banaate hai
 Since these people only talk instead of working, they do not want to let you be strong
 desh main isse durbal sarkaar or koi nahin rahi he
 He lashed out at the Narendra Modi government at the Center and said, "hearing the voice of the people is the greatest political power
" sarkaar aapaki baat nahin sun rahi he, yah shakti nahin durbalata he
 He does not have the courage in this government to listen to you
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri modi gaanv—gaanv isaliye nahin jate, kyonki vahaan sachai dikhaai detii he
 Priyanka said that when the announcement was made, the BJP government said that all these are electoral junctions and the country has the necessary for this scheme
 Not only money, but when the debt of industrialists was to be forgiven, then where did 317 thousand crore rupees come from this government
 priyanka ne kaha ki ab janata ko hi sochna hoga ki usne kis par vishwaas kiya tha or yah bhi sochiye ki kya aise logon par dobaaraa vishwaas karnaa chahie? isse pehle priyanka ne hanumangadhi mandir main darshan kiye or kshetra ke vibhinn gaanv main jansampark kiya
 After that he also participated in road shows
 loksabhaa chunaav ke ‘ran’ main tamaam siyaasi dalon ne qamar kas lee he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi addressed a rally in Chandrapur, Maharashtra on Friday

 ‘nyaay’ par rahul gandhi ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main party ke jeetne par desh ke 20 fisadi sabase garib pariwaron ko 72,000 rupee har saal unke khaaton main bheje jaaenge or iske liye ham neerav modi, anil ambani, mehul chokasee or vijay maalya se paise lekar garibon ko denge
 Let me tell you that earlier Rahul Gandhi gave the same answer to a question asked by a student in Pune, Maharashtra
 raily main rahul gandhi ne notebandi, jiesti, rojgaar or kisaan ke mudde ko uthaate hue ek baar phir pradhanmantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that BJP did nothing for the farmers
 congress party kii sarkaar aane par ham kisaanon ke kheton par kii food processing factriyaan lagaayenge, jinamein kisaan sidhe apana maal bhej sakegaa or use storage kii suvidha bhi muhaiyaa karaayenge taaki kisaan ko zyada se laabh mili
 The Congress party is also committed to provide the farmer with the right price for his crop
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki modi sarkaar main arthvyavastha chaupat he, logon ko rojgaar nahin mil rahaa he
 The poor do not get loans
 yuva rojgaar karnaa chahta he, lekin use bank se lone nahin miltaa he
 Rahul said that it is not that there is no money
 ‘manaregaa’ ko chalaane ke liye saal ke 35 hajaar karod rupee lagate hai
 Meaning you can employ crores of people by applying 35 thousand crores
 lekin 35 hajaar karod rupee to neerav modi ne chura le liya
 Vijay Mallya, Mehul Chowki are doing all this
 congress party aegi to ye paisa jo in 15-20 logon ko ja rahaa he wo paisa sidhe aapke bank acount main daaloongaa
 Significantly, today is the Friday of rallies in the General Assembly elections

 Feroz, originally from Bihar, lived here on rent
 jakir nagar main hi firoz kaa export kaa kaarkaana bhi he
 Recently Feroze had also bought a new house, in which he had to shift on Friday

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 raajnneeti main naitikta chunaav saapekshikahoti he or vyaavhaarikta satta saapekshik hoti he
 i have not discovered this chromosome of politics ie DNA
 isaki khoj aap janata ne kii he jis par jami dhul ko jhaad kar main phir se pesh kar rahaa hum
 So the chances of forming a government in Delhi are again looming
 is disha main bijepi ne tamaam sanketon kaa prakshepan kar diya he
 The term launch is used to launch a rocket
 aaj dopaher jab rajdhani dilli kaa televijan vaidic kaal main apana koi guzaaraa dhundh rahaa tha tabhi sookhe kii maar kii khabaron ke bich dilli main sarkaar kii khabar aa gai
 When our colleague Akhilesh Sharma broke the news that the BJP is preparing to form a government in Delhi
 party ko videsh daure par gaye pradhanmantri narendra modi kii vaapasi kaa intazaar he
 Akhilesh also informed on the basis of indications that Jagdish Mukhi's name seems to be ahead in the race for the Chief Minister
 pro jagadish mukhi dilli ke puraane netaaon main se ek hai
 Janakpuri is a seven-time MLA from the Assembly and has also been the Leader of the Opposition, including the former Finance Minister
 raajnneeti ko aksar uski vidambnaaon main dekhnaa chahie
 Those were also the days when Vijay Goel dominated the BJP posters as compared to Sheila Dixit and Arvind Kejriwal
 lekin, chunaav aate-aate vijay goyal badal gaye or harshavardhan aa gaye
 When the result came, Harshavardhan Sahib came and stopped to reach the destination
 vijay goyal rajya sabha pahunche or dow harshavardhan loksabhaa jeet gaye
 He left the candidature of the Chief Minister of Delhi and became Union Health Minister
 is bich eemaandaar netaa ke taur par kiran bedi kaa naam bhi chalane laga
 His tweet towards politics also moved the name further
 lekin, bijepi ke adhyaksh pad par satish upaadhyaay aa gaye
 bjp's election in-charge Nitin Gadkari also won from Nagpur and became Union Minister
 ab pro jagadish mukhi kaa naam aayaa he
 i do not know whether the names of the first ones will come
 bijepi ko bhale hi dilli kii satta nahin mili, magar bijepi main satta parivartan jabardast hua
 According to the Aam Aadmi Party, the BJP is engaged in buying its mlas
 congress ne yaa congress ke kisi vidhayak ne aise aarope nahin lagaae hai ki bijepi unhen yaa unke vidhayakon ko khareednaa chaahati he
 In Delhi, where tomatoes are sixty rupees a kilo, the purchase process should not be used for mlas in Delhi
 to kya vaaki bijepi ab nae sire se sarkaar banane kaa daawa karne ja rahi he
 The irony was no less in the opposition camp
 shila dikshit haar kar kerala kii rajyapal bani to narendra modi piem banakar istipha maangane lage
 The Congress lost all seven seats in the Lok Sabha in Delhi and could win 44 seats across the country
 14 farvari ko istipha dene vaale arvind kejariwal ne 21 may tak maafee maang lee ki sarkaar chhodkar badi galati ho gai he
 AAP did not get a single Lok Sabha seat in Delhi but got four mps
 aap ne vidhansabha bhang karne kii sifarish kii thi
 But, the central government imposed President's rule
 iske khilaaf aam aadmi party supreme court chali gai jise adaalat ne samvidhan peeth ke paas bhej diya he, jahaan 4 agast ko sunwaayee hogi
 The Constitution Bench has to decide whether it can direct the Lieutenant Governor or the President to conduct elections in Delhi
 magar samvidhan peeth main bhejne se pehle ki ek sunwaayee main adaalat ne ek tippanee kii thi ki raajnneeti main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 The Congress initially supported AAP to keep the BJP out
 agar aap unki badi dushman ban jaati he to aap ko baahar rakhane ke liye bijepi se gathbandhan kar sakati he
 Anyway, both of them did not allow the Jan Lokpal Bill to be introduced in the Delhi Assembly
 vidhansabha main jaisi ghatana ghati usase to kuch bhi asambhav nahin lagata
 Even Congress and BJP can form government together
 shabdash: to nahin magar yah tippanee bhavishyavaanee banati dikh rahi he
 The Congress may not support, but like broken wires, its mlas can form the BJP government
 isi sunwaayee ke sandarbh main ek or baat hui
 Arvind Kejriwal wrote to the Lieutenant Governor not to dissolve the assembly for a week, while petitioning the court to dissolve
 sikaa rupi naitikta ke head bhi hai or tail bhi
 On December 9, 2013, Dr
 Harsh Vardhan's statement is that if no other party is ready to form the government, neither will we bother them nor will we sell
 to ab bijepi kyon kah rahi he ki uparajyapal bulaayenge to dekhenge
 After all, why does the BJP with a strong majority in the Lok Sabha not talk about elections in Delhi
 kahin kharid farokht ko toothpaste kii tarah nae naam se laanch to nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 The Congress has made every mathematics of forming a government impossible by not supporting AAP again
 channelon par phir se vahi graphics board banane lage hai
 The BJP and the Akali had 32 seats in the 70-seat assembly
 harshavardhan, pravesh verma, ramesh vidhudi ke saansad banane se sankhya 28 ho gai he
 The combined strength of Akali Dal and BJP is 29
 ek nirdaleey or aap se nishkasit vidhayak se sankhya 31 ho jaati he
 Six of the Congress's eight will have to be broken to avoid the defection law
 is tarah se bijepi kii sarkaar ban jaati he
 Sources say that BJP is not in touch with AAP mlas
 ye kamaal kii sutreey soochna he
 If the AAP is not in touch with the mlas, should it be assumed that the Congress mlas are in touch
 khayr
 The Congress is saying that its mlas are not breaking up
 ab is khel main hamaare sahyogi raveesh ranjan shukla ek or angel lekar aa gaye hai
 Six Congress mlas are in contact with Ramvir Singh Vidhuri
 vidhudi ji, mukhi ji kaa hissaa markar khud siem bananaa chaahate hai
 They are pressurizing the BJP leadership through six mlas
 kahin, dilli main jagdambika paal moment na ho jaae jab 1998 main jagdambika paal ek din ke liye siem ban gaye the
 There are so many stories of defection in our politics that every question of morality dies another cut

 Sometimes, a bullet starts firing from the mouth without a bullet, sometimes even after firing, the gun forgets to fire
 par is baar to sachmuch had hi kar di
 The UP Police was undergoing training how to deal with it if a riot or a mob becomes violent
 training ke liye baqayada police ke saath-saath bheed bhi jutai gai
 Now training starts
 police se kaha jaataa he ki wo ghode par baithenge or unheen ghode ko dauda kar dangaiyon ko peeche khadedenge
 Now what happened next was surprising
 kabhi thany thany, to kabhi tag bag tag bagkya goli-kya bandook, kya gaadi kya ghoda
 All are stupid things
 sab bekaam kii chijen hai
 These are just for work
 goli bandook main naa bhi ho to munh se thany-thany kar den
 If there is no horse-carriage, do it yourself tugbug-tugbug
 sach main kamaal kii he apni upi police
 And some Bihar Police as well

 Crying in the state of UP police kya haalat bana di he apni police kii
 Such poverty, such helplessness, helplessness

 The enemies of the law will start making jokes on the law instead of being scared of the law

 ab kya karen camere ne bhi aisi ghudsawaari kahaan dekhi thi pehle
 Five policemen rode on black white horses and headed towards the rioters
 ab is par mat jaaie ki ghode kis nasl ke the, yaa kitne tagade the
 Awesome horse riding police would sometimes come up and down
 phir chalaange bhi maarthe
 After this, they would enter the area of rioters and chase them
 yogi ji ne aise hi nahin bolaa tha ki upi police ko aisa bana denge ki neuyark police bhi rashk karegi
 And he really did
 neuyark police kii bhi kya majaal jo aisi ghudsawaari kar le

 Malik said, "the sad part is that our players are playing today in the same way that Indian players played against us in the eighties and nineties
 unhone kaha, mujhe assi kaa dashak yaad aa rahaa he jab ham bharat ke khilaaf jeet rahe the
 We always felt that most of his players are not playing as a unit and they are only interested in securing their place for the next match by scoring 30 or 40 runs

 This was the reason they had to fight against us

 It is better to say to the children lovingly, 'I know that it does not feel very good to eat you, but it takes a little time for any new food to taste good and only then you will know its taste
 '2
 Never tell children that you eat selectively
 unhen pyaar se samajhakar kahen ki khaane ke jaayke ko samajho, thodaa-thodaa karke shuru karon, tumhe acha lagegaa
 If you say again and again about the food of their choice, then the children will not like it at all
 3
 Never refuse children for their favorite ice cream, cake or chocolate
 isaki jagah unhen kahen, 'ham abhi icecream yaa chocolate nahin kha sakate kyonki ye lunch time he
 We will make a plan to eat ice cream some other day
 4
 Do not forcefully feed children
 iske badale unhen samajhakar kahen ki achche se kha lo kyonki agle khaane main vakt he or tab tak tumhen bhukh na lag jaae
 5
 bacchon ko chocolate yaa unki pasandida chizon kaa laalach dekar kabhi khaane ke liye badhaava na den
 Try to make your own interesting and healthy food, which should entice the children to eat

 The Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi has announced to give free travel to women in metro and dtc-cluster buses
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne kaha he ki agle 2-3 maheenon main yah yojana lagu ho jaaegi
 However, questions are also being raised about whether the central government will not come in the way of this decision of the Kejriwal government
 saath hi kai or pahalu bhi hai, jinhen lekar abhi tak tasviir spasht nahin he
 Till now, Arvind Kejriwal has been complaining that whatever the government does for his welfare, the Modi government at the Center, through the Lieutenant Governor, obstructs such decisions
 aise main 3 june ko jab kejariwal ne metro or bason main muft safar kaa elaan kiya to unase yah sawaal bhi kiya gaya
 On this, Kejriwal said that in the free travel scheme, the government will give subsidy money from its treasury, so there is no need for the permission of the center for this
 haalanki, iske alaava bhi kai aise sawaal hai jinke jawaab milane abhi baaki hai
 The biggest question is how this exemption of free travel will be given to women
 masalan, kya metro steshnon par unke liye alag se entry kii vyavastha kii jaaegi yaa koi smart card yaa token jari kiya jayega
 It is not yet clear whether the subsidy money will be given to the beneficiaries or paid to Delhi Metro
 vahiin, agar labhaarthi mahila ko alag se koi card jari kiya jaataa he to us card kaa istemaal paatr mahila ke alaava koi na kar sake, isaki kya vyavastha hogi
 Or for women, separate entry and exit gates will be made at the stations
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki bason main free safar karana sarkaar ke liye utani badi chunauti nahin hogi, lekin metro main is vyavastha ko kaayam karnaa ek bada chalange he
 It is also being said that if the facility of free travel is provided through smart card or token, then the methods of Metro fare collection will have to be changed
 aise main metro niyamon main agar koi badlaav hota he to uske liye centre sarkaar kii manjuuri kii aavashyata pad sakati he
 Women outside Delhi will also get benefit? Also this question is also in the center of discussion that whether this facility will be only for the women of Delhi or the women traveling in the Delhi Metro everyday from NCR and other areas will also get its benefits
 will get
 ye sawaal isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki noida main shuru hui nai metro line ke uddhatan main dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ko aamantrit nahin kiya gaya tha or upi ke siem yogi adityanath uddhatan samaaroh kaa hissaa bane the kyonki sawaal sarkaron kii hissedari kaa tha
 There are many such questions on which the situation is yet to be clarified
 sarkaar janata se bhi is yojana par pratikriya le rahi he
 Deputy CM Manish Sisodia has made a plan to travel on buses himself on Tuesday, in which he will take public opinion on free travel

 menon) After gaining the support of the central government on how to deal with the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said on Monday that political initiatives are needed to deal with the situation in the Kashmir Valley, but at the same time clarified that the situation there first Should be normal
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh or grih mantri pi chidambaram ke saath baithak ke baad umr ne hinsa par utaaru pradarshnakariyon ko bhi sakht sandesh dete hue kaha ki agar karfu bandishon kaa ulanghan kiya gaya to iske parinaam ‘dukhad or gambhir’ honge
 The violent incidents that started on Friday in the state have killed 18 people in the last four days
 halaat par kaabo paane kaa prayaas kar rahe mukhyamantri umr somvaar dopaher rajdhani pahunche or sidhe pradhanmantri se mulaakaat karne gaye
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi, saddened by the recent situation in this state called the paradise of the earth, also expressed grief over the latest incidents of violence and said that there are some elements in the state who are spreading violence with some 'hidden motives'
 vah chaahati hai ki aise tatwon kii pahchaan kii jaae or unhen kanoon ke ghere main laayaa jaae
 Omar said that there are political situations in Jammu and Kashmir, which can only be resolved in a political manner
 unhone baithkon kaa silsilaa samaapt karne ke baad srinagar ravaanaa hone se pehle samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ise aarthik package kii bajaay ek raajnneetik package kii jarurat he
 Omar said that the curfew would be strictly enforced and demanded additional paramilitary forces and especially Rapid Action Force to deal with the protesters
 unhone kaha, ‘jammu or kashmir ek raajnneetik sthiti he
 It needs political settlement
 ise ek aarthik package se zyada raajnneetik package kii jarurat he
 By political package i mean dealing with matters like Armed Forces Special Powers Act, activities of security forces, rehabilitation package for youth crossing the Line of Control and compensation for victims of the current violence
 umr ne kaha, ‘hamane ghati ke halaat par vistaar se charchaa kii or is baat par aam sahmati thi ki is tarah kii pahal shuru karne se pehle yah jaruri he ki ghati main halaat saamaanya hon
 'official sources said that the central government is ready to launch political initiatives in the state
 isamen pruthakatavaadiyon se baatcheet kii pahal bhi shaamil he, lekin iske liye sarkaar chaahati he ki vah pehle hinsa kaa rasta chhod den
 Sources said that the Center denied the possibility of change of leadership in the state and assured the Chief Minister of all kind support
 umr ne bataaya ki chidambaram ne unhen atirikt bal dene ke maamle main purna sahyog dene kaa aashwaasan diya he, lekin saath hi spasht kiya he ki vah chaahate hai ki rajya main kam se kam log hataahat hon
 He admitted that there is pressure on the security forces in the state
 unhone kaha ki sanyam to dono pakshon ko hi rakhana hoga or yah ekatarfa nahin ho saktaa
 Omar said, 'seeing the rage of the protests, the security forces made every effort to exercise restraint
 2008 main isse kahin kam ugrata vaale or kam avadhi ke virodh pradarshnon main isse zyada log maare gaye the
 Omar said that the Jammu and Kashmir problem is a political problem and keeping this in mind, both the central and state governments believe that some much-awaited measures can be announced in the state, but it is necessary that most Things should be normal first
 taaja hinsa ke bare main puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main umr ne kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki koi ek khaas dal yaa koi ek vyakti ghati ke puure halaat ko sanchalit kar rahaa he
 Omar said, 'I think there are many elements working behind all this
 kai ilaakon main vyapak virodh pradarshan ho rahe hai
 In such a situation, it cannot be assumed that any one party or person is organizing, managing and conducting such a large scale demonstration
 ’apni praarambhik tippanee main mukhyamantri ne kaha, ‘aap kashmir ghati ke bade ilaake main pichley ek maheene se bhi adhik samay ke halaat se acchhee tarah waakif hai
 "sadly, we are caught in a cycle of violence where violent deaths escalate when people die
" pradarshnakariyon ko dabaane kii koshish kii jaati he to or log marate hai or uske virodh main phir hinsak pradarshan hote hai
 Omar said, 'we want people to stop taking the law into their own hands
 ham chaahate hai ki log sarkari sampatti, police thane or anya imaaraton ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaaen
 When people take the law into their own hands, the use of force has to be decided and unfortunately the consequences of such decisions are often severe and tragic
 ’unhone kaha, ‘maine vakt vakt par logon se apil kii he ki vah hinsa or araajaktaa ke is chakra ko toden or sarkaar ko halaat saamaanya banane kaa mauka den
 All the members of the Cabinet's Committee on Security (CCS), including Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, Home Minister p Chidambaram, Defense Minister AK Antony and Foreign Minister SM Krishna were present in the meeting with the Prime Minister

 The echo of instability in the Kashmir Valley was also heard in the Lok Sabha, when the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party demanded a parliamentary party delegation to take stock of the situation in the region

 By the way, the Shiv Sena has also forgotten that the possibility of building the road is with both parties

 a Delhi court has said that the finger test (PV) of victims of sexual violence is a violation of their constitutional rights
 adaalat ne pivi pareekshan ko apraasangik bataate hue kaha ki police ko isse bachanaa chahie, khaskar bacchon, naaballig ladakiyon or vivaahit mahilaon ke maamle main isse parhez karnaa chahie
 Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau stated that the PV test is irrelevant in hearing sexual violence cases
 yah pareekshan niztaa ke moulik adhikaar kaa ulanghan he
 The court said that state action should not violate the constitutional rights of a person
 adaalat ne is baat par afsos jataayaa ki doctor niyamit rup se yah pareekshan karte hai
 The court made this remark during the hearing of a case of sexual misconduct with a woman
 adaalat ne kaha ki is aadesh kii pratiyaan dilli police ke ayukta ko bheji jaani chahie taaki police adhikariyon kaa dhyaan is ore khinchaa ja sake
 The court said that if this test is mandatory, it should be done only after the consent of the victim or his guardian
 iske alaava adaalat se bhi anumati lee jaani chahie
 In the last two months of electoral upheaval, where the big news of the country and the world has remained a mere whisper, it would be a little unfair to complain about the administration's neglect of the news
 phir bhi yahaan uski yadi baat kii ja rahi he, to keval isliye, kyonki in baton kaa sambandh kaaphi kuch janata kii jaruri maangon se he
 In the meantime, orders have been issued for the appointment of ex-officio posts of nine Joint Secretary level of the Central Government
 haalanki sthaayee afasaron ne iskaa kaaphi virodh kiya tha, lekin sarkaar ko uske is nirnay par logon kaa jitna ekatarfa samarthan mila, vah chankane vaala tha
 This support reflects the fact that people are keen on changes in administration
 lekin kya sach main sarkaar bhi iske liye utsuk he? yah prashn man main isliye uth rahaa he ki kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke na to ghoshnaa patr main prashasan ke sudhaar ke bare main ek bhi shabd padhane ko miltaa he, or na hi kisi netaa ke bhaashan main ek bhi shabd sunne ko
 Why is this so? We find some answer in the electoral scenario of the states and the center
 loksabhaa or vidhansabha ke chunavi dangal main ucch-stareey prashasnic adhikariyon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 This number is not only for those who have either retired, or have just retired
 balki ek bada bhaag unka he, jo abhi apane karier ke madhya main hai, or ek aisa acha karier unki pratiksha kar rahaa he, jo lagbhag-lagbhag nishchit sa he
 Yet they are doing so
 yah pravriti badhati hi jaati he
 If this trend had nothing to do with the quality of administration, there was nothing to worry about
 lekin aisa he nahin
 There have been reports of several commissions and committees on how the unholy alliance of administration, politics and capitalists is taking democracy as hostage
 samay-samay par ucchtam nyaayalay ne bhi kaaphi kadi tippaniyan kii hai
 But even for improvement in this direction, there is no trace of concern at all
 balki raajnneetik dalon kii ore se ise lagaataar utsahit hi kiya ja rahaa he
 a worrying evidence of this is being seen in the functioning of the present Election Commission, against which a lot of public opinion is being raised
 inke dwaara spasht rup se maang kii ja rahi he ki chunaav ayuktaon kii niyukti raashtrapati (vyavhaar main pradhanmantri) ke dwaara na hokar kendriya satarkta ayukta kii tarah ho
 i would also like to add another improvement on my part that the Election Commissioners should be banned from accepting any public post after their release
 chunaav kisi bhi loktantric vyavastha kii gangotri hoti he
 It is very important to maintain its purity
 chunaav ke isi bhare-puure daur ke bich civil seva pariksha ke nateezon kii ghoshnaa hui
 Although the nature of the previous results were also constantly putting question marks on the practical strength of this examination system, but this time too much was reached
 is parinaam kii do baaten chintaa paidaa karne vaali lageen
 The first is that whoever is seen among the successful contestants is an engineer
 in ejiniyaron main iaiti se bhi hai, or aise bhi hai, jo karod rupee ke vaarshik package ko chhodkar is das lakh rupee ke vaarshik package main aa rahe hai
 That is, instead of the Indian Administrative Service, it is gradually becoming an engineer administrative service
 isaki duusari chintaa pehle se hi judi hui he
 As engineers are gaining control over this, this examination has almost become English
 hindi evam anya bhartiya bhashaaon vaale pratiyogi gaayab hote ja rahe hai
 Certainly in the future, they will have a lot of negative effects in administration
 rajanetaaon ko isse koi fark nahin padane vaala, lekin logon ko to padegaa
 Therefore, it has become inevitable now that along with improvement in politics and elections, the matter of improvement in administration should also be raised loudly

 lekin bharat sarkaar ke sutara bataa rahe hai ki hurriyat netaaon ko pakistani enese sartaaj ajij se milane kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 Meanwhile, police have been deployed outside the house of separatist leaders Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Shabbir Shah and Syed Ali Shah Geelani before meeting Sartaj Aziz
 sutron ne bataaya ki yaccin malik or mirwij ghar par nahin hai or anantnag ja rahe hai
 Significantly, Sartaj Aziz offered the Hurriyat leaders a meeting either before or after meeting Indian NSA Ajit Doval, which they have accepted
 sutara bataa rahe hai ki bharat sarkaar hurriyat netaaon sesarataaj ajij kii prastaavit mulakatse naaraaz he or is bare main pakistan or hurriyat donon se naaraazgi jataa di gai he

 These poems and shero-shayari are part of the political history of that era
 ho saktaa he ki priyanka ko iskaa ilm na ho
 It is possible that someone else is writing their language
 upi ke jis pratapgarh jile main piem modi ne rajeev gandhi ko bhrasht kaha tha aaj vahiin priyanka gandhi ne unke upar urdu adab ke mashhoor shero se hamalaa kiya
 Priyanka read a lion of Shahab Jaffrey that - "you don't talk about here and there ye bataa ki kafila kyon lutaa? May i tell why the convoy was robbed? tera rahajanon se vaasta
 i do not get wet with my loved ones teri rahabari pe sawaal he xxrep 4 ' puraane vakt main arab ke registan main vyapaariyon ke kafile chalate the
 On the unknown desert paths, the people used to rob them
 isliye har kafile ke saath ek rahabar yani sahi rasta dikhaane vaala bhi chalata tha
 "this lion of Priyanka means that PM Modi who was in the role of Rahbar, who showed the way, looted the convoy of the country from the people
 lekin shaayad priyanka ko ye pataa nahin hoga ki unke pita rajeev gandhi ne ek talakshuda muslim mahila shahabano ko guzaara bhatta dene ke supreme court ke faisle ko sansad se palatwa diya tha
 Then his cabinet minister Arif Mohammad Khan resigned in Parliament against his father, Rajiv Gandhi, in his own language
 priyanka gandhi ne abhi 7 may ko ambala main apni raily main raashtra kavi ramdhaari singh dinakar ke khand kavy 'rashmirathi' kii kavita 'krishna kii chetavanee' kii kuch panktiyaan padhi thim
 The theme of the poem is that during the Mahabharata, when Lord Krishna goes to convince the Kauravas that they should not fight, they ask Duryodhana to tie Lord Krishna
 iskaa jo zikr ramdhaari singh dinakar ne kiya he vahi priyanka ne raily main sunaaya ki-''jab naash manuj par chaataa he, Vivek dies first
 hari ne bheeshan hunkaar kiya, Dagmag-dagmag bhagwaan kupit hokar bole- 'help me by raising the chain haa, haa duryodhana! baandh mujhe''ye jaananaa dilachasp hoga ki priyanka kii daadi indira gandhi ke khilaaf 25 june 1975 ko dilli kii ramlila maidan se jai prakaash narayan ne sampurna kranti kaa yuddh ghosh karne ke liye dinakar kii isi 'krishna kii chetavanee' kii duusari panktiyaan ''singhasana khaali karo ki janata aati he'' istemaal kii thim
 However, there are two lines of this poem by Dinkar which are very used in Indian politics
 
 
 ''yachana nahin ab ran hoga, Jeevan Jai Ya Kya Marran Hoga '' Priyanka also used these lines of a poem by the famous populist poet Adam Gondvi to denounce the promises of development at Pratapgarh rally
 ''tumhaari filon main gaanv kaa mausam gulabi he
 But these figures are false, this claim is bookish

 NDA allies are angry with BJP and now they are about to move a no confidence motion against the government
 ye dal tidipi or wiesar congress hai
 Both these parties will present a no-confidence motion against the central government on the issue of granting special state status to Andhra Pradesh
 wiesar congress ke saansad vivi subba reddy ne avishvaas prastaav ke notice ko somvaar kii kaarywahi main shaamil karne ke liye loksabhaa sachivalay ko likhaa he
 TDP has also given notice for the no-confidence motion
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko ye donon partiyaan avishvaas prastaav laana chaahati thim, lekin yah pesh nahin ho sakaa tha
 For this, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar had argued that in the event of chaos in the House, the Speaker rejected the motion of no confidence
 aapako bataa den ki shuukravaar ko tiares, ediemke samet anya partiyaan kai muddon par sadan ke wel main aakar hangaamaa kar rahi thim
 However, nothing can be said about whether the house will be organized on Monday or not

 The YSR Congress has moved a no-confidence motion
 vahiin, andhra pradesh main sattaruentidipi bhi is maamle par wiesar ke saath aa gai he
 Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu has announced to break up with the NDA
 unke do mantri cabinet se istipha bhi de chuke hai
 The motion of no-confidence must have the support of at least 50 mps
 congress, diemke, tiemasi, espi ke alaava left partiyon ne avishvaas prastaav ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya he
 However, the central government is confident that it will prove its majority
 is samay loksabhaa main 539 saansad hai
 270 mps are needed to prove a majority
 akele bijepi ke paas 274 saansad hai
 Apart from this, BJP also has the support of other parties

 Apple has alleged that Samsung Electronics has copied the design of the iphone and due to this Samsung has to pay money as penalty
 haalanki yah aipal or samsung kaa ye patent vivaad kis turm par settle kiya gaya he abhi tak yah saaf nahin he
 Significantly, the term of settlement was done in the American District Court for the Northern District of California
 aapako bataa den ki iphone kaa dizin copy karne cholekar is patent kii jang 2011main shuru hui
 The court initially sought a $ 1 billion fine from Samsung, ruling in favor of Apple
 haalanki yah cese yaheen khatm nahin hua
 Actually, Apple has alleged that Samsung has stolen the basic functions of Apple
 udhaaharan ke taur par tap tu juum, home screen ap grid or leout
 The real issue was that Samsung had gained popularity in the early days by copying Apple's design and user interface and the same accusation has been made by Apple
 dilachasp ye rahaa he ki jeuri ne bhi mana kii samsung ne aisa kiya he yani aipal kaa aarope sahi he
 Recently it was talked about settling the case by giving $ 539 million to Samsung
 iske baad samsung ne phir se apil kii
 But both companies have now reached the agreement before the next hearing that the time has come to end the case
 aipal ne is cese ko settle karne ke liye jo terms hai uske bare main media ko nahin bataaya he
 Although Apple has said that the company is very serious about the design and this case is always more than money
 is maamle main samsung kii taraf se ab tak koi bayaan nahin aayaa he
 Samsung Electronics appealed to the US Supreme Court after a trial loss in late 2016 and the court did not reject Samsung's plea that Samsung said all the money earned from the stolen design to the patent infringer Should not be given, because that was only a part of the design
 is patent kii jang main phayda aipal kaa hi mana ja rahaa he
 But it will be interesting to see what are the terms on which both the companies have decided to stop this patent battle

 There are differences between the two important ministers of the central government on this issue
 janajaatiy maamalon ke mantri kishorchandra dev apni baat par kaayam hai
 They believe that the encounter in Basuguda in the last week of June was wrong and that most of the deaths were lost
 unke mutabik is incounter ko lekar jo sawaal unhone uthaae hai unpar vah aaj bhi kaayam hai
 ' is maamle kii nyaayik jaanch ho rahi he
 However, Home Minister p Chidambaram has already supported the CRPF action
 ab bhi vah itnaa bhar kah rahe hai ki agar koi begunaah maaraa gaya to iske liye unhen khed he
 But Kishore Chandra Dev said on Wednesday that out of the 19 killed, at least 17 innocent civilians were killed who were unarmed and were only in dhoti-vest
 guuruuvaar ko bhi kishorchandra dev ne mana ki incounter ko lekar grih mantri kii safai se vah santusht nahin hai
 He said, 'on the basis of the facts that Chidambaram possessed, he made a statement


 i spoke on the basis of the facts that i had

 According to him, he still persists on the questions he has raised regarding this encounter

 Even now he is saying so much that if someone is killed innocent then he is sorry for this
 lekin kishor chandra dev ne buudhvaar ko hi kaha ki maare gaye 19 logon main kam se kam 17 bekasoor naagarik maare gaye jo nihathe the or sirf dhoti−baniyaan main the

 vishwa hindu parishadne daliton ke saath hone vaali chuaachhut dur karne ke naam par program shuru kiya he 'hindu parivaar mitra'
 But this program is seen to be more associated with programs like Dharma Parivartan and Homecoming than their social upliftment
 darasal, pichley saal chuaachhut ke do raajnneetik maamle surkhiyon main aae
 In February 2014, Narendra Modi and in September 2014, Jeetan Ram Manjhi told how they too have been victims of untouchability
 tab modi gujarat ke mukhyamantri or bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar the, jabaki jithan ram maanjhi bihar ke mukhyamantri
 At the program of a Dalit Forum in Kochi, Modi said, 'I have been a victim of untouchability even today
 ' phir unhone ek behatar bhavishya kii ummid bhi jataai, 'bade aatmavishvaas se kahana chahta hum ki aazaadee ke 60 saal main jo bhi utaar chadhaav aae hon
 
 
 Whichever effect is there
 
 
 lekin mere shabd likh kar ke rakhie aane vaale das saal
 
 
 Dalits in India, the oppressed oppressed backward, extremely backward
 
 
 inhen kii baat chalane vaali he
 At an event in Patna, Manjhi said that people washed the idol and the temple complex after they went to Madhubani's temple where they worshiped during the election campaign
 maanjhi ke mutabik us ghar ko bhi dhoyaa gaya, jahaan wo kuch vakt ke liye tehre the
 vhp's campaign against untouchability After the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has also decided to campaign against untouchability
 viechpi kii is muhim ko naam diya gaya he - 'hindu parivaar mitra'
 Under this scheme, upper caste people will eat food with Dalits and then their pictures will be put on social media
 aakhir kya he 'hindu parivaar mitra' yojana? aaie jaanate hai -bado kii jimmedaari1
 Under this scheme, every upper caste family will form friendly relations with a Dalit family
 ek-duusare ke ghar aaenge-jaaenge
 Both families will appear together in a time of happiness and sorrow
 2
 Two such families will sit together and have dinner at home, not by going to a hotel or a dhaba
 jab donon parivaar ghoomane nikalen to ghar kaa bana khaanaa lekar jaaenge or aapas main mil-baantkar khaaenge
 Responsibility of children: When both families are sitting together and having food, then the children or teenagers of the house will take a picture of whoever is together
 uske baad unhen ye tasviir whatsap, fasebuk par share kerani hogi
 It is said that for this, VHP workers will reach village after village and meet with ethnic communities and give a message to all of them to build mutual Hindu unity
 bahut kathin he dagar panghat kiprivaar mitra banane kii is raah main rode bahut hai
 There is more talk of cities, but the situation in villages has still not changed
 1
 Let's assume that the upper caste people of Hindu society will befriend the people of the Dalit family
 isse acchhee baat aakhir ho bhi kya sakati he
 Will VHP workers be able to explain this to the people where untouchability is prevalent? Does VHP have such an impact on Hindu society that people will accept it? And if people do not agree, will VHP workers force them to do this work? 2
 shaharon main savarna or dalit padosi ho sakate hai
 Such people will be found in the adjacent flat
 lekin bahut se gaanvon main to daliton kii basti hi alag basaai gai he
 People of Dalit family come to the upper castes and eat
 shaadi ke maukey par unhen khaanaa khilaayaa to jaataa he lekin aakhir main
 If Dalits get married here, then there are definitely some of the upper caste people who go to bless them
 lekin unamem se kitne vahaan khaanaa bhi khate hai? viechpi aisa koun sa chamatkaar karegi ki ye bhedbhaav mit jaaenge?3
 In the 'hindu Parivar Mitra' scheme, arrangements will be made to put photos of food on social media
 isse ek swaabhaavik massej to ye jarur jayega ki sabhi saath saath khaanaa kha rahe hai, lekin kya prachaarit bhi vaaki yahi baat hogi? khaanaa khaane vaale kya jor-shor se ye nahin bataaenge ki unhone aisa kiya
 That is, even after eating, they will tell that the people with whom they have eaten are Dalits

 Friendship happens naturally
 saath main padhai ke chalate, padosi hone ke naate yaa phir aisi hi kisi or vajah se
 Can there be friendship under a campaign? aisa to tabhi sambhav he jab logon ko badale main kuch miltaa ho yaa phir koi swaarth ho
 Friends become friends in families due to professional relationships
 lekin aksar aisi dosti vyavsaayik sambandh na rahane par khatm bhi ho jaati he
 What is VHP going to do for this? kya viechpi kii ore se iske liye koi reword bhi diya jayega?peshwaon ke shasankaal main achhuton ko us sadak par chalane kii chhot nahin thi jis par koi savarna hindu chal rahaa ho
 The untouchables were asked to tie a black thread to their wrist or neck, so that the upper caste could not touch them by mistake
 is saamaajik bantwaare ko hi sampradayik bantwaare kaa sabase bada kaaran mana jaataa he
 For years, the politics of almost all political parties has been going on due to this social and communal divide
 jab daliton ke ghar jaakar rahul gandhi khaanaa kha rahe the to unki aalochana hoti rahi ki wo dhong kar rahe hai
 From Mayawati to Baba Ramdev, everyone knows what is not said
 haalanki baad main aisi khabaren bhi ain ki rahul ne dobaaraa unki ore kabhi najar uthaakar nahin dekha
 Now the RSS and then the VHP have decided to campaign for it
 haal hi main aresas ne sabhi hinduon ke liye 'ek kuan, ek mandir or ek shmashaan bhoomi' kii avadharana par aage badhane kaa faisla kiya
 The Sangh has understood that it cannot be united without eliminating discrimination within Hindu society
 agar viechpi netaa praveen togadiya ko is abhiyaan main thodi bhi safalataa milti he to nishchit rup se log unke jahrile bhaashanon ko bhul kar unhen usee rup main yaad karenge jis tarah swami dayanand saraswati or mahatma gandhi ko yaad karte hai

 The trends from Telangana have shown that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government will be formed there
 rujhaan ye bhi bataate hai ki tiares telugana main spasht bahumat se sarkaar banaaegi
 The Congress was claiming victory before the election, but its seats could not reach even in double digits
 yahi haal bijepi kaa bhi rahaa
 However, TRS and BJP have an undisclosed alliance
 ke chandrashekhar raav philhal telugana ke kaaryvahak mukhyamantri hai, lekin jeet ke baad phir ve hi mukhyamantri banenge
 With this election it was also clear that Chandrasekhar Rao's incarnation in Telangana is intact
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne yahaan kai chunavi reliyaan kin or kai jansabhaon main raav or unki sarkaar ke khilaaf hamalaa bolaa, lekin ant nateeja congress ke liye jahaan dukhad rahaa to tiaresake liye sukhad
 Chandrasekhar Rao, popularly known as KCR, makes his way of doing politics and his sense of belonging to people different from other leaders of the country
 saal 2014 main andhra pradesh se alag hone ke baad telugana kaa nirmaan hua, lekin pichley 5 saal main kesiar ne jaministhar par aise kai kaam kiye jinase anya partiyon or netaaon ko kesiar kii raajnneeti main sendhamari karne kaa mauka tak nahin mila
 The formation of TRS is considered to be an important reason for separate Telangana
 tiares kii ladaai isi siddhant par rahi ki use telugana kshetra kii bhalaai ke liye andhra pradesh se alag hona he or logon ke saath ho rahe bhedbhaav kaa koi sarthak samaadhaan nikaalnaa he
 Telangana eventually split from Andhra Pradesh and KCR became the Chief Minister in 2014
 yah koi pehla mauka nahin tha jab kesiar ke haath koi badi jimmedaari mili ho
 Earlier in 2004, he was elected as TRS candidate from Siddipet assembly and Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituency
 2004 kaa sansadeey chunaav kesiar ke liye kuch khaas tha kyonki tiares ne congress ke saath chunaav ladaa tha
 The Congress had assured KCR that Telangana would be given a separate statehood status
 is chunaav main kesiar ke alaava 5 tiares ke netaa saansad banaae gaye, lekin tatkalincongress sarkaar ne kesiar se kiya vaada puraa nahin kiya
 After this the distances between Congress and TRS increased
 bijepi ne telugana banane main madad kii or is lihaaj se bijepi or tiares main nazdikiyaan kuch khaas hai
 These closures were seen in the 2018 assembly elections when the BJP openly announced that the BJP would help the TRS in the event of a decrease in seats
 game changer hai kesiarakesiar kaa telugana vidhansabha ko bhang karne or samay se pehle chunaav karaane ke faisle ko masterstroke mana gaya
 However, to make their way difficult, the Congress and TDP unexpectedly joined hands and formed a grand alliance and claimed to be a game changer
 is gathbandhanamen bhartiya communist party (sipiai) or nai bani party telugana jan samiti bhi shaamil ho gai
 The opposition's claim in the state was strengthened by the joining of these four parties
 survey main bhi bataaya gaya ki congress kii dakshin telugana ke jilon main acchhee pakad he, lihaajavah tiares kaa kaam kharaab kar sakati he lekin kesiar ne daanv ulataa kar diya or ab spasht bahumat ke saath unki sarkaar banane ja rahi he

 This gave the state a reliable database that was unprecedented in terms of its reach and depth

 The state is at the top with 89,883 transactions per thousand, followed by Andhra Pradesh (82,868) and Kerala (59,582)
 is safalataa kii ridh he digital telugana kaarykram
 To provide digital facility to all, Telangana Fiber Grid (t-fiber) is creating a large-scale digital network infrastructure to connect 84 lakh families in the state
 mishan bhagirath ke tahat bichne walewater pipe root ke saath hi tii-fibre ke dwaara fibre optic cabel bhi bichaaya jayega

 har morche par kamkesiar kii sarkaar ne rajkaaj kii suvidha ke liye 2016 main 10 jilon ko punagarthit kar 31 main badal diya

 2015 main hui hardik kii raily ne kai netaaon kii neend uda di thi
 Unemployment is a big issue While the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi's entire emphasis was to increase the economic pace of the state
 unhone duniyabar ke niveshkon ko aamantrit kiya tha
 Vibrant Gujarat is an attempt by this
 modi kii in sari koshishon kaa asar ye rahaa ki rajya main nijee ajukeshan or profeshnal institutes kii bharmaar ho gai
 Despite all this, there was a complaint that the youth of Gujarat who came out of these institutions still remain unemployed
 skill deveopment kaa yuvaaon ko phayda nahin mila
 According to data from All India Council for Technical Education, in the year 2015-16, less than 20 percent engineering graduate youth got jobs in Gujarat, according to data from All India Council for Technical Education
 vahiin 11190 computer science main graduates main se mahaj 3407 ko hi campus placement main naukari mili
 In addition, less than five percent of the graduate youth in civil engineering got a place in the campus selection
 patidaar ke baad kurmi or gujjaron par thi najar2014 main narendra modi rajya se nikalakar centre kii satta par asin ho gaye
 In the absence of Modi, 22-year-old Hardik Patel emerged as a big youth leader of the Patidar society in the state
 hardik ne patidaar samaaj ke liye aarakshan kii maang karte hue rajya main kai badi reliyaan kin
 This demand for giving OBC status to the Patidar society continued to gain momentum throughout the state
 apni reliyon main lakhon yuvaaon kii umadti bheed dekh hardik ne anya rajyon ke kurmi or gujjaron ko bhi saath main jodne kii koshish kii
 That is why Hardik visited there in Bihar elections too
 bade netaaon kii uda di thi neenthhardik patel ne 2015 main gujarat main kai badi reliyaan kii thim
 These rallies put the government of the state under pressure
 tatkaaleen anandiben sarkaar ke liye musiibat tab or bad gai jab usee vakt daliton ne bhi andolan shuru kar diya
 Due to the demand of the Patidars, in September 2015, the money of the Chief Minister Yuva Swavalamban Scheme with a budget of 1000 crores for the general category youth was reduced
 april 2016 main jab hardik patel jail main the, us samay gujarat sarkaar ne patidaaron ko 10 pratishat aarakshan dene ke liye adhyadesh jari kar diya
 Due to this the economically backward class got a quota of 10 percent
 is adhyadesh ko agast 2016 main gujarat hoicourt main chunauti di gai
 Later the Rupani government challenged the Gujarat High Court's decision in the Supreme Court
 chaar oktober 2016 ko yah adhyadesh radd ho gaya
 Hardik Patel himself is caught in the dilemma by giving an ultimatum to Hardikkongress
 media main ai khabaron ke mutabik pichley hafte hi ahmedabad main hardik ne rahul gandhi se mulaakaat kii thi
 However, he later rejected the meeting
 sutron ke mutabik hardik ne is mulaakaat main patidaaron ko naukari or shikshan sansthaanon main pravesh kii maang kii thi
 Hardik had asked Rahul how the Congress would provide quotas to the Patidars? Hardik was also asked to remove constitutional bottlenecks in providing reservation to Patidars
 sutron ke mutabik hardik ne gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main apana samarthan dene se pehle congress ko in sabhi sthitiyon ko saaf karne ke liye kaha tha
 After the ultimatum, the Congress has just kept silence
 samarthan diya to congress se chhitakegaa bada vot bankpatidaar samaaj ko obisi cote main samyojit karne ke prayaas se obisi cote kaa bada vot bank congress se chhitak saktaa he
 The OBC quota in Gujarat is about 54 percent of the electorate
 aise main sawaal ye he ki rahul gandhi hardik patel ke samarthan ke liye itane bada vot bank chhitakane kaa risk lenge? rahul gandhi patidaar samaaj ke liye alag se kota dene kaa vaada bhi nahin kar sakate, kyonki yah sanvaidhanik rup se sambhav nahin he
 It is also difficult to form a new party, if Rahul Gandhi did not promise to provide reservation to the Patidar community, it could be the most difficult for Hardik Patel
 hardik patel ke bhaajapa ko samarthan dene ke dur-dur tak asaar nahin hai
 If Rahul does not respond to Hardik's ultimatum, then he has no choice but to go for the Third Front
 ab gujarat chunaav main bahut vakt nahin bachaa he, aise main hardik nai party bhi nahin bana sakate
 Now if Hardik distances himself from the election, his existence as a Patidar leader will also be questioned
 to phir nai sarkaar par banaaenge dabatogar rahul ne hardik kii baat nahin maani to hardik ke saamne aam aadmi party ke rup main ek or vikalp hoga
 But you do not have any support base in Gujarat right now
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki hardik ke agenda main phir chunaav ke baad jo bhi sarkaar aegi, us par patidaar samaaj ke liye aarakshan kaa dabaav banavaane kii hi hogi
 Police has registered an FIR against Hardik Patel seeking reservation for the Patidar community in Gujarat
 un par rashtradhvaj kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope he
 An FIR has been registered against Hardik at Vyara police station in Tapi district
 rajkot ke espi gaganadip gambhir ne bataaya ki hardik ne ravivaar dopaher police ke roke jane par jab uchhalkar car main baithne kii koshish kii, to tirangaa unke pair se chhu gaya tha
 Hardik was taken into custody from outside the Rajkot Stadium
 yah hua tha dopaher main
 
 
 The SP of Rajkot said that Hardik always tries to remain in the headlines
 dopaher main bhi aisa hi hua
 Whatever they have done, the law does not allow it, so an FIR will be filed against them
 car jabt, driver par bhi hogi karrwaiespi ne bataaya ki police ne hardik kii car jabt kar lee he or car ke driver ke khilaaf bhi karrwai kii jaaegi, kyonki uske paas license bhi nahin tha
 Hardik and the driver were unable to present the car papers
 chilchilaati dhoop or umas ke bich barish kii kuch bunde sirf tan hi nahin man ko bhi bhigo detii hai
 The rainy season fills everyone's heart with gaiety
 lekin agar yahi pani kii bunde agar bemausam barish kii ho to sara majaa kirkira ho jaataa he
 Such rain not only makes a person sick but also irritability becomes part of his nature
 bemausam barish kii vajah se vyakti kai tarah ke sankraman kii chapet main aa saktaa he
 In such a situation, by taking some precaution you can relieve yourself from these diseases occurring in the rainy season
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kya hai ye bimaariyaan or kya hai unase bachane ke upaay
 Winter-cold - It is known as influenza in English language
 barish ke mausam main hone vaali yah sabase saamaanya beemaari he
 In this season some infectious viruses affect the nose and throat by infecting the upper part of the respiratory tract
 jisaki vajah se vyakti main band naak, badan dard, gale main khichkhich, khaansee or bukhaar jaise lakshan dikhaai dene lagate hai
 Treatment- If you are also suffering from a cold, then take any medicine by asking the doctor
 iske alaava zukam main paryaapt maatra main taral padaarth ke saath poshak or santulit aahaar len
 Doing this strengthens the immune system of the body and helps to avoid disease
 iske alaava vitamin si se bharpoor fal or hari subjiyan aahaar main shaamil karen
 If this disease spreads through infection, then stay away from the infected person
 diaria -barsaat ke mausam main diaria bhi sabase zyada pareshaan karata he
 This disease is caused by bacterial infection
 isamen pet main marod uthne ke saath dast lag jate hai
 It is usually caused by consuming polluted water and food items during the rainy season
 is rog se batane ke liye khaane pine kii chizon ko dhank kar rakhen, pani ubalkar va chaanakar pien or kuch bhi khaane se pehle haath dhonaa bilkul na bhoolen
 Food Poisoning: There is also a risk of food poisoning during the rainy season
 is beemaari main pet main anthan, michali, ulti or dast kii shikaayat hone lagati he
 When food poisoning occurs, the patient starts feeling weak in the body
 ilajhais beemaari main sharir ke andar pani kii kami hone lagati he
 In this stage, do not eat raw food like salads
 aisa isliye bhi he kyonki kai baar salad ko acchhee tarah saaf nahin kiya gaya hota yaa wo sahi taapmaana par nahin rakhe hote hai
 In such a situation, avoid eating chaat found on the side of the road
 unako bane ke liye dooshit pani kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Measures to avoid these diseases due to rain - Use clean water to avoid diseases like diarrhea
 koshish karen ki sirf ublaa hua pani hi pien
 -every person in the house uses a different hand towel
 aisa karne se beemaari failaane vaale bacteria aapako nuksaan nahin pahunchaa sakenge
 -cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief while coughing or sneezing
 aisa karne se aapke aasapaas baithe log sankramit hone se bache rahenge
 - Eat homemade food, avoid eating outside food
 - hand sanitizerka kaa niyamit rup se istemaal karen

 Currently Rohit Sharma sits at the top of the list of greatest individual innings in the history of one-day International cricket, scoring 264 runs in 173 balls with 33 fours and nine sixes against Sri Lanka on 13 November 2014 in Kolkata
 
 rohit sharma ke alaava bhi kai bhartiya kapil se kahin aage nikal chuke hai, or is suchi main virendra sahvaag, sachin tendulkar, mahendra singh dhoni, saurav ganguli or viraat kohli bhi kapil se upar hai
 Apart from these, many foreign batsmen have also left Kapil behind, but even though Kapil Dev has slipped to number 23 in the list of the biggest individual innings in the history of one-day International cricket, but still in the heart of Indian fans, Tunbridge Wells That innings played in Kapil is bigger than every big innings
 kapil dev kaa sabase badi van-de pari kaa yah record agle saal west indies ke dhuandhar ballebaaj vivian richards ne todaa, jab unhone england ke khilaaf manchester main 170 gendon main naabad 189 ran thoke, jinamein 21 chauke or paanch chakke shaamil the
 By the way, this record of Kapil has been broken many times so far, and many Indian and foreign batsmen have played big innings from Kapil
 is samay van-de international cricket ke itihaas kii sabase badi vyaktigat pariyon kii suchi main sheersh par rohit sharma baithe hai, jinhone kolkata main 13 november, 2014 ko srilanka ke khilaaf 173 gendon main 33 chaukon or nau chhakkon kii madad se 264 ran thoke the
 Apart from Rohit Sharma, many Indians have surpassed Kapil, and in this list Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Sourav Ganguly and Virat Kohli are also above Kapil
 inke atirikt kai videshi ballebaaj bhi kapil ko peeche chhod chuke hai, lekin bhale hi kapil dev van-de international cricket ke itihaas kii sabase badi vyaktigat pariyon kii suchi main 23wein number par khisak gaye hai, lekin aaj bhi bhartiya prashansakon ke dilodimag main tanbrij wales main kheli gai kapil kii vah pari har badi pari se zyaada badi he

 haalanki, 1962 main jeetne ke baad vah 1967 kaa chunaav lard hi nahin paae, jiske chalate bhi aisa hua

 During the hearing of a case, the judge of the Madras High Court said that the fingers and the hands of the fraudsters should be cut off
 madras hai court ke sitting jaj es vaidyanathan jameen kii dhokhadhadi maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahe the
 He said, 'recently i read an article on the punishment of criminals in Iran
 iraan main dhokhadhadi karne waalon ke liye nai sajaa tay kii gai he
 Fingers are cut from a machine of such people
 shiraj kii adaalat main aise aparaadhiyon kii ungliyaan kaatane ke liye ek mashin rakhi gai he
 'he regretted that such a law is not there in our country
 unhone kaha ki nakli kagajaat banane vaale dhokhebaajon ke liye hamaare desh main bhi aisa kanoon hona chahie
 If there are such stringent laws then criminals will not commit such forgery
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki sab register offis ke aise adhikariyon ke haath bhi kaat dene chahie, jo aise aparaadhiyon ke saath milakar logon kii sampatti hadapte hai
 He imposed a fine of Rs one lakh on the man who cheated on the case
 unhone is raashi ko chennai ke chaar sansthaanon main baraabar baantne kaa aadesh bhi diya he, jinamein se ek cancer sanstha he
 Has the country's first indigenous nuclear submarine been commissioned? If you ask anyone about this, no one is ready to open their mouth? Apart from this, the authorities are also seen to be avoiding taking its name
 vaise mana yah bhi ja rahaa he ki arihant nausena main shaamil ho gai he par is par koi bhi kuch bolne ko taiyaar nahin he
 Vice Admiral GS Pabbi, the Indian Navy's warship production and procurement controller, when asked about the nuclear submarine, INS Arihant, to join the navy said that this is a highly sensitive issue, but we will soon announce it
 jab poocha gaya ki kab anouns karenge, to bas itnaa hi kaha ki jald
 They are also not ready to tell whether Arihant is still under trial in the sea or has been commissioned! gauratlab he ki arihant ke saare trial safal ho chuke hai, bas intjaar he to adhikarik taur par elaan karke hari jhandi dene kaa
 Everyone is eyeing its commission, whether it is China or Pakistan, because India already has long-range nuclear missiles from the sky or land
 ab iske aa jane se samandar ke morche par bhi bharat kii takat kai guna bad jaaegi
 The comments bharat, america, france, rus, britain or china ke baad chatha aisa desh ho gaya he jisane apni parmaanu pandubbi banane main kamyaabi hasil kii he
 The six thousand tonne Arihant has missile ranges ranging from 750 km to 3500 km
 isse pani ke andar or pani kii sataha se parmaanu missile daagi ja sakati he
 Not only this, any aircraft can also be targeted from under water
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne 2009 main arihant ko laanch kiya tha
 It was then said that the submarine would be commissioned within two years but it was delayed due to several reasons
 philhal bharat ke paas rus se lij par lee gai parmaanu pandubbi ienes chakra he
 India is building three submarines like the Arihant
 bhartiya nausena ke yudhpot utpaadan or kharid niyantrak vaais admiral jies pabbi se jab parmaanu pandubbi, ienes arihant ke nausena main shaamil hone ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki yah behad sanvadensheel ishyu he, lekin is par ham jald hi anounsament karenge
 When asked when to announce, just said that soon
 ve bhi bataane ko taiyaar nahin hai ki arihant kaa abhi bhi samandar main trial chal rahaa he yaa phir kamishan ho chukaa he! Significantly, all the trials of Arihant have been successful, just waiting, then the official announcement to give the green signal
 iske kamishan par sabaki najar he, chaahe vah china ho yaa pakistan, kyonki bharat ke paas pehle se aasmaan yaa jameen se lambii duuri tak maar karne vaali parmaanu misile hai
 Now with its arrival, India's strength on the sea front will also increase manifold
 tippaniyan India has become the sixth country after the US, France, Russia, Britain and China to achieve success in building its nuclear submarine
 chah hajaar ton vajani arihant main 750 kilometre se lekar 3500 kilometre tak kii maarak kshamta vaali misile hai
 This allows nuclear missiles to be fired under water and from the surface of water
 yahi nahin, pani ke andar se kisi vimaan ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya ja saktaa he
 Arihant was launched by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2009
 tab yah kaha gaya tha ki do saal ke bheetar hi pandubbi kaa kamishan ho jayega lekin kai vajahon se der hoti rahi
 Currently, India has a nuclear submarine INS Chakra leased from Russia
 bharat arihant kii tarah teen pandubbi bana rahaa he
