 Badal has an impact among the farmers of Punjab, and INLD of Chautala in Haryana

 In Bihar, Nitish Kumar has influence on agricultural castes who have stayed away from Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal
 vahiin, ajit kaa pashchimi uttar pradesh ke jat kisaanon par prabhaav he
 Amidst all this, Sharad Yadav, the executive convenor of the NDA, is also of a peasant background

 If Chidambaram will do with Kamal Nath, then we will find that we have leaders who understand the pain of farmers and village poor, they have such people
 ''lekin yah baat sirf rajg kii nahin he
 Many farmer leaders have also emerged in the BJP that led it
 jahaan party kii pahchaan pehle aisi brahman or baniyaa aadhaarit party kii rahi he jiske matadaata sirf shaharon main rahete the, vahiin uski chhavi badalati dikh rahi he

 es
 Yeddyurappa, he is also a farmer
 party adhyaksh rajnath, jo rajg kii pichhali sarkaar ke aakhri varshon main krishi mantri rahe hai, bhi kisaan hi hai
 He says, "we do not use farmers as vote banks
" upie ko unki chintaa aakhri varsh main hui or vah bhi be-man se
 We are the true benefactors of farmers
 '' ve kehete hai ki agar rajg is chunaav main jitkar sarkaar banaata he to kisaanon ko chaar fisadi se bhi kam byaaj dar par karj denge or krishi kii aamadani kaa beemaa karaayaa jayega, jiskaa 75 fisadi premium centre sarkaar degi
 At the same time, Ajit says, "upa's image was ruined among the farmers because it did not have the mechanism of the workers to bring its plans to the farmers to the ground
" '' ve bataate hai ki 1990 main janata dal sarkaar ne kisaanon ke 10,000 ru

 hona chahie
 They express concern, "the benefit of the existing loan waiver is being extended to the same farmers who did not pay even a single installment
" jinhone ek bhi kist adaa kar di, unhen phayda nahin mil rahaa he
 In fact, the BJP is already active in making inroads among farmers
 vidarbha anchal main kisaanon kii aatmahatyaon ke bich party ne reliyaan kii thim or party adhyaksh bhi vahaan gaye the
 While the BJP president was worried that his image was of a Thakur leader till he lived in Uttar Pradesh, after coming to Delhi, he chose farmers as part of his efforts to broaden his identity, whereas his party lacked such faces at the national level
 Has made the peasant class feel connected
 
 He started raising issues related to farmers
 saath hi, sahyogi dalon ke kisaan netaaon ke bich paith banaai
 Sharad Yadav's support proved to be helpful for him in this matter
 udhar, in koshishon ko vyapak banane ke liye bhaajapa kii madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii sarkarein bhi nai-nai yojanaon ke jariye kisaanon ko lubhaane kii koshish kar rahi hai
 In this way, now there are not as many farmers leaders in the BJP and its allies at present as in the UPA
 haalanki upie sarkaar main sharad pavaar or lalu yadav aadi ne kisaanon kii karj maafee yojana ke liye dabaav banaaya, lekin unka prabhaav maharashtra or bihar tak hi simit he
 "still farmers are committing suicide," says Rajnath
 isse sabit hota he ki upie sarkaar kisaanon kii asli samasya nahin pahchaan pai he
 "but this gathering needs to garner votes from farmers' displeasure
" chunaav se pehle chandigarh or dilli main rajg ko kisaanon kii do badi reliyaan kerani thim, ve ho hi nahin pain
 At the same time, in Uttar Pradesh, the home of BJP president, there is a famine of the peasant leaders in the party
 haalat yah he ki suukhaagrast bundelkhand main kisaanon kii raahat ke liye arabon ru
 Most of the package amount that was received, has been spent in the name of planting saplings overnight and a large amount is being spent on the purchase of computers etc
 sabko pataa he ki sarkari adhikari koi bhi rakam kharidari main kharch karne ko kyon utaavle rahete hai
 But the BJP does not have leaders voicing the displeasure of the farmers in the state
 asal main bhumandalikaran ke daur main kisaan mahaj vot bank ban gaye hai
 While the majority of the country's population is dependent on agriculture, the farmer is also the largest producer, consumer and buyer
 lekin durbhaagya se kisaanon kii aamadani badhaane or kheti ko aakarshak dhandha banane kii pahal koi sarkaar nahin karti
 Even after six decades of independence, farming is a profession which no one seems happy after adopting, so one feels a backwardness in calling himself a farmer
 vot bank kii khatir bahuterey netaaon ke liye khud ko 'kisaan kaa betaa' bataanaa ek fishan he, isliye dekhne kii baat yahi hogi ki rajg bebas kisaanon ko apane kisaan netaaon ke jariye kahaan tak apni baat samaj paata he

 Negi's wife also repeated the same thing to her son Gautam
 unhone kaha, ‘ham bahut khush hai

 ’ The opposition solidarity rally organized by Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata led to a massive siege of the current Modi government
 modi virodh main darjanon netaaon ne shabdon ke baan chalaae to bachaav centre ke mantri or bhartiya janata party bhi utar ai
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that these leaders made one thing clear that their only objective is to remove Prime Minister Narendra Modi and that is the issue of election for them
 lekin unka netaa koun he, ye kisi ko nahin pataa he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that another interesting thing was seen in this rally that the leaders of the so-called grand alliance said that the people of the country will decide who will be the leader of our alliance
 mahagathbandhan ke netaa pehle ye to bataaen ki aapkaa netaa koun he, tabhi to desh kii janata chunaav main parakhegi
 But they know that this election is a very weak link for them

 Today's India is full of hopes

 Today's India is one whose economic progress is one of the biggest economic advancements in the world
 aaj kaa bharat ye he jiskaa duniya main bada maan he or jisko banane main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii bahut badi bhoomika he
 PM Modi's honesty, Grand Alliance problem: The Union Minister further said that we understand the problems of the leaders of the Grand Alliance
 jitne netaa kolkata main manch par baithe hue the, unamem kai partiyon ke netaa ke upar bhrashtachar ke gambhir aarope hai
 Their problem is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has acted honestly
 mahagathbandhan kaa doosraa uddeshy yahi he bhrashtachar main lipt netaaon ko bachaane kaa
 Is this what the country wants? The people of this country will decide
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguwai main eemaandaar bharat kaa nirmaan ho rahaa he
 The pace of honest India is not going to stop, no matter how many alliances are formed for it

 On unemployment too, Jawabrishankar Prasad said that there is talk of unemployment again and again, but whether it is Mudra Yojana, IT sector, whether it is a common service center, whether roads are being built, electricity is coming, whether it is Ujjwala Be it plan, there are so many schemes led by Modi ji in which crores of people have got work opportunities
 mobile banane kii ikaiyaan 2 se badhkar ke 127 ho gai hai jisamen lakhon logon ko naukari mili hai
 Not having any issues with the Mahagathbandhan, Prasad said that we understand the trouble and nervousness of the leaders of the so-called Mahagathbandhan, to the extent that those who did not like the Congress with a teary eye, Today he is sitting with Congress
 iskaa matlab yahi hua ki ve akele dam par bhaajapa, endie or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko nahin haraa sakate
 This is our victory and their defeat

 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley arrived at this dinner hosted by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 donon paas main baithe, unke bich baatcheet hui or donon ke chehron par muskaraahat dikh rahi thi
 Seeing this rare coincidence, the guests at the dinner were also feeling quite good

 However, politics has also started in this case

 'my government is seen as bad for change' Wow Kejriwal ji! Wow! Is the old showy wrestling drama over? That is when Gadkari called the Kejriwal party a help to BJP before the Goa elections

 com / paucfrhnbc— Ajay Maken (@ajaymaken)january 18, 2018asal main guuruuvaar ko dilli main jiesti concil kii baithak thi, jo shaam der tak chali, kyonki agenda main kai sari chijen thim
 Many things could not be decided this time
 concil ke sadasyon ke liye dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne dinar yojit kiya tha
 After the end of the GST meeting, when the Finance Minister and senior officials of the state were coming out of the hall of the venue Vigyan Bhawan, they were surrounded by journalists waiting for news for seven hours
 zyaadaatar rajyon ke vitt mantri patrakaron ko bite dene main lag gaye
 But Delhi Deputy CM and Finance Minister Manish Sisodia refused to talk to reporters
 ve thode adheer dikh rahe the
 He said something in the ears of the Finance Ministers of all the states and then gave some instructions to his officers and employees
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal negiasti consilki baithak main aae sabhi sadasyon ke liye dilli ke mashhoor five sences garden main dinar yojit kiya tha
 Kejriwal had reached the dinner venue directly and had given the responsibility to Manish Sisodia to take the members of the GST Council there
 kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ghar jane kii taiyaari kar rahe the, lekin sisodiya ne unase bhi dinar main chalane kaa anurodh kiya
 Jaitley asked his junior minister, Pratap Shuklase, whether he had seen the garden (dinner venue)? Shukla said no, but he said that he too is ready to walk to dinner
 iske baad vitt mantri kejariwal ke dinar main pahunche
 It was nice to see all the people, because the bitterness between the two leaders in the defamation case is not hidden from anyone
 is dinar ke bare main jiesti concil or vitt mantri ke media prabhariyon kii taraf se koi jaankaree share nahin kii gai, lekin aam aadmi party ke twitor handle par isaki kai acchhee tasviren saajha kii gai hai
 It is seen in these pictures that Jaitley and Kejriwal are sitting close by
 thand se bachane ke liye arun jetali ek sunahare rang kii shawl odhakar pahunche the
 He spoke very little to Kejriwal, but both of them were seen smiling
 dinar aayojan sthal five sences garden mahrauli ke paas said-ul-ajaayab ilaake main kareeb 20 acre main bana hua he
 It is considered to be one of the finest heritage and activity zones in the capital
 dinar main kejariwal ke saath dipti siem manish sisodiya ke alaava dilli ke khaadya evam aapurti mantri imran hossain bhi the
 The Delhi government had also arranged 8 luxury buses to take all the guests to the venue
 kai atithiyon ne to trephic jam or deree se bachane ke liye metro, phir cab kaa bhi sahaara liya
 Significantly, Arun Jaitley has filed a defamation suit against Kejriwal besides Ashutosh, Kumar Vishwas, Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadha and Deepak Bajpayee
 AAP ke netaaon ne DDCA main arun jetali ke adhyaksh rahane ke dauraan bhrashtachar kaa aarope lagaaya tha, jis par arun jetali ne 10 karod rupee kii manahani kaa daawa kiya he
 Regardless of the bitterness between the two leaders due to the defamation lawsuit, the good thing is that they both forgot it and showed a good gesture and enjoyed the dinner
 rashtramandal khelon main kathith bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke bare main sarkaar ne sansad main aashwaasan diya ki vah is sandarbh main sabhi aavashyak karrwai karegi
 He said that the concerned agencies should take swift action in this matter and hold whoever is responsible for it
 khel mantri emes gil ne rajyasabha main ek alp soochna prashn ke jawaab main kaha ‘‘bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye sarkaar harsambhav karrwai karegi
 If this is the case, i will write to the concerned authorities including the Finance Minister and ask them to look seriously at these allegations
 ’’ unhone haalanki in khelon kii taiyaariyon kii nigaraanee karne ke liye koi sheersh samiti gathit karne kii maang ko asweekaar kar diya
 Referring to the findings of the Central Vigilance Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor General, he said that the agencies should act swiftly and hold whoever is responsible for it
 gil ne manonith sadsy manishankar ayyar or bhaajapa ke vikram verma kii yah maang khaarij kar di ki rashtramandal khel pariyojnaon kii taiyaari kii nigaraanee ke liye usee tarah kii ucch adhikaar praapt samiti gathit kii jaani chahie jaisi samiti 1982 main sampann asian khelon ke liye gathit kii gai thi
 The Sports Minister said, "such committees do nothing
 ’’unhone kaha ki ayyar ko antarrashtriya anubhav he ‘‘lekin mere paas prashasnic anubhav he
 If the committees could solve the country's problems, we would have ten such committees, but this is not the solution
 ’’ ayyar ne maang kii thi ki gil kii adhyakshata main ek ucch adhikaar praapt samiti gathit kii jaani chahie jo khelon kii taiyaariyon par nigaraanee rakhe
 Gill, in response to Prakash Javadekar's short notice question, said that there is less than two months left for the Commonwealth Games and now we have no other option but to organize them successfully
 unhone bataaya ki jawaharlal nehru stadium sahit sabhi bade stadium taiyaar ho chuke hai

 In fact, this student had criticized the Chief Minister on social networking website Facebook on Friday, and on Sunday his post was seen lying on the roadside in the form of very large hoardings
 kalakatta uniwarsity main snatakottar kii chaatra ab behad dari hui he
 Apart from this roadside hoarding, she is also receiving threats from local women associated with the Trinamool Congress
 is hording ko lagane vaali damdam ward 8 citizans cameti kaa maananaa he ki agar loktantr main is ladki ko mukhyamantri kii aalochana karne kaa adhikaar he, to anya logon ko bhi isi loktantr ke chalate use saarvajanik rup se lataadne kaa haq he
 The hoarding states, "we condemn the Chief Minister's criticism
 
 
 " The Calcutta University student was angry at the procession of the idols of Goddess Durga, which was received by the West Bengal Chief Minister herself on Friday, and was promoted as 'kolkata's answer to Rio Carnival'
 chaatra kaa maananaa tha ki yah yatra kaa sahi samay nahin he, kyonki is vakt rajya berojgaare or garibi kii samasyaon se jujh rahaa he
 Some of her friends agreed with the student, but some disagreed
 baharhaal, is baat kaa pataa nahin chal paaya he ki hording lagane vaali citizans cameti ne chaatra ke fasebuk pej tak pahunch kaise banaai
 Local residents do not agree with the views of Deepdas student
 unhone palatakar sawaal kiya, "21-varshiya ladki yah sab kaise kah sakati he
 
 
 Especially when the Chief Minister is doing so much for the state

 When Ashok Chavan was removed in one stroke on the morning of 9 November, he was stunned
 lekin naitikta yaa kushasan ke kaaran kursi se bedakhal hone vaale mukhyamantriyon kii qatari main ve pratham hai
 Many Chief Ministers are still in line behind them
 agle saal assam, andhra pradesh, dilli, kerala, karnataka, pashchim bengal, jammu-kashmir or tamilnadu main nae mukhyamantri aa sakate hai
 The current Chief Ministers of these states will either show the high command out or the voters will remove them from the chair
 baraak obama kaa swaagat karte samay ashok ko gumaan bhi nahin tha ki unki yah antim mukhya bhoomika he
 On November 6, a TV journalist expressed such apprehension that he had rejected her out of resentment
 nattejey se anjaan ashok ne 10 november ko cabinet kii baithak bhi bula rakhi thi
 The day before, he was to meet two devotees of his Guru Sai Baba
 par honi ko koun taal saktaa he, 'bhagwaan' bhi nahin
 9 in the morning
 15 baje unhen suchit kiya gaya ki sonia gandhi ne unka istipha manjuur kar liya he
 Prithviraj Chavan was his only option, as he is the only leader in the Maharashtra Congress who has no scandal
 shuru main prithviraj yah pad sweekaar karne se hichake
 But today Mr
 Clean needs more than the Chief Minister's chair, Congress needs Mr
 Clean more, but party interests dominate
 khud ko bachaane kii aakhri koshish main ashok ne adarsh ghotaale main vilasarav deshmukh, narayan rane or susheel kumaar scindia jaise sabhi daavedaaron ko lapet liya
 But he could not tarnish the image of Prithviraj
 purv mukhyamantri ko rahul gandhi se najdiki par bharosa tha
 He was so confident about Rahul that when he was going to 10 Janpath to resign, he visited Sonia's powerful political secretary Ahmed Patel's residence for the first time
 64 varshiya prithviraj ko congress kii taqatvar tikdi-maa, bete or pradhanmantri-kaa aashirwad hasil he
 Even if he is not a grassroots leader
 congress ke bahut kam mukhyamantri aise hai
 His equation with Sharad Pawar is also not good
 10 janpath kii marksheet main prithviraj ke liye yah bonus he, par rakanpa ke saath gathbandhan sarkaar chalaane main yah ek baadha bhi he
 However, Pawar has welcomed the new chief minister
 nijee baatcheet main rakanpa khush nahin he
 It is sad that the Congress has chosen Pawar's staunch opponent
 naaraaz rakanpa ne rajya main pichhadi jati ke chagan bhujabal kii jagah up-mukhyamantri kii kursi par sharad pavaar ke bhattije, maratha netaa ajit pavaar ko baitha diya
 This is a sign for Congress
 prithviraj or ajit donon hi maratha hai
 The Congress had requested the NCP not to remove Bhujbal to maintain caste balance, but did not accept the NCP
 pranav mukherjee ne media ko bataaya ki ashok kaa istipha sweekaar karne kii vajah kuch 'tathy or dharanaen' hai
 This is the reason, three other Chief Ministers are also changing aspects on their chairs
 rajdhani main charchaa he ki agali gaaj dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit par girane vaali he
 But this discussion has been there for so long that now people have no faith in these things

 On the other hand, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh
 rosaiya ko rajbhavan bheja ja saktaa he
 The 77-year-old chief minister, who is troubled by poor health and ambitious Jagmohan Reddy, is losing his grip in the state

 Sonia is thinking of adopting the Maharashtra model in Andhra Pradesh by imposing a leader from Delhi
 ve netaa kendriya mantri jaipal reddy bhi ho sakate hai
 Congress strategy: Since it cannot create a separate Telangana state, the best option is to give the entire Andhra Pradesh to someone from Telangana
 agle saal assam main chunaav hai, or kam hi sambhaavna he ki do baar vijayi rahe tarun gogoi tikdi bana paaenge
 At the age of 74, he does not fit into Rahul's thinking of the Youth Congress
 yah shikaayat bhi he ki ve apane un mantriyon kii mushken nahin kas rahe jin par dakshini assam main vikaas ke liye di gai rakam ek ugravadi sanghathan ko pahunchane kaa aarope he
 But Gogoi can be given a second chance due to his lack of an option in Congress
 congress ke sahyogi jammu-kashmir ke mukhya-mantri umr abdulla ko teji se ehsaas ho rahaa he ki viraasat dodhari talwaar hoti he
 Recently there was pressure on his party to swap between his father Farooq Abdullah and him at the Center
 agar dobaaraa shashan ladkadaaya to centre ko majabuuran raashtrapati shashan lagaana hoga
 In the worst case scenario, the Congress may have to tie up with Muhammed Saeed, Omar's staunch opponent
 sitambar main sonia ne mufti se dobaaraa baatcheet shuru kar di thi
 Omar knows that Rahul is the only reason for getting Congress support
 lekin ashok unhen bataa sakate hai ki yah kaaphi nahin he

 transgenders ko 15 april ko 'third gender’ ghoshit karne kaa supreme court kaa aitihaasik faisla aane se teen hafte pehle gauri saavant mumbai main malad link road par auto rickshaw main ja rahi thim
 Suddenly he asked the driver to stop and take back the auto
 gauri ne ek aadmi ko sadak paar karte dekha or unki ankhon se aansu chhalak pade
 He was his father whom he had not seen for the last 15 years
 gauri kahati hai, ''aaj main pradhanmantri kii bagal main baithkar transgender (hijdaa) hone ke bare main baat kar sakati hum, lekin apane pita ko aawaaj lagane kii himmat mujhamen ab bhi nahin he
 "gauri was born in Mumbai to a Maratha family in Dadar
 unka naam ganesh nandan hua karata tha
 He was the son of Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP)
 apni sexuality ke bare main pita se baat na kar paane kii vajah se gauri ghar se bhaag gayi
 Today, he is a 36-year-old castrated transgender (castrated eunuch) with a sari on his body, flaring cheeks and a big red dot on his forehead
 kuch saal pehle unhone veginoplasty karai or tay kiya ki ve deh vyapaar or bheekh maangane kii raah par nahin chalengi
 She runs a Sakhi Char Chowgi shelter in Malawani, Malad for runaway transgenders
 gauri bataati hai, ''mere gaanv main unhone meraa antim sanskaar kar diya he
 My father told him that i was dead
 ” unke liye aaj bhale hi bahut der ho chuki he, lekin gauri chaahati hai ki agali peedi ko sweekaaryata, shiksha or rojgaar sab kuch mili

 Transgenders all over the country keep their news on the Internet and know that they can take refuge here
 gauri is baat kaa puraa dhyaan rakhti hai ki yah centre un logon kaa adda na ban jaae, jo deh vyapaar chalaanaa chaahate hai yaa maanav taskari kar sakate hai
 It is the center of the reputation of transgenders
 ek dashak se bhi pehle kamathipura main transgenders ke badnaam pinjre khatm hone ke baad se yah pratishtha khaak main mil gai thi
 Since then, there was no option but to live on the streets and begging for the transgender to live
 gauri kaa kahana he ki auraton ke vesh main lalabatti par bheekh maangane vaale or paise na dene waalon ko gaali dene vaale mardon ne hi transgenders ko badnaam kiya he, ''asli transgenders batti par bheekh nahin maangate
 Real transgenders don't even curse

 They have to follow a mandatory period of three years of counseling and live like transgenders
 uske baad hi unka badhiya kiya ja saktaa he
 She says, "men and women have to come forward and tell people about themselves, but in transgenders, we only physically know who we are
" main ek mard hum, lekin main aurat jaisi dikhti hum or sari pahenti hum
 It becomes clear
 isiilie hamaare liye sweekaaryata bahut jaruri he
 "gauri points to Mandeli and says," How will i resettle those who ran away from the house without any documents? The first thing is, by what name and address proof will i give him? " This is the biggest hurdle for all transgenders to get legal recognition

 According to him, 2,50,000 transgenders in Mumbai are not entitled to employment, do not have a PAN card, cannot open a bank account, cannot rent a house and can also inherit parental property
 unhen vot dene kaa adhikaar nahin he, skool main daakhila nahin le sakate yaa nagarpalika se pheri lagane athwa dukaan kaa license paane kii anumati nahin le sakate

 23 varshiya lakshmi gauri urf lachhu, 26 varshiya raakhi or 24 varshiya bitti ko sweekaaryata kii nahin, sirf izzat se jeene kii chahat he

 The conservative family and fraternity protested, but Lachhu's mother supported her son, who became a daughter, and left the house with her
 aaj ve sadak ke us paar rahete hai
 The joint family that evicted them has embraced him
 lachhu bataati hai, ''halaat mere kaam karne se badale

 ”in mid-2013, 250 transgender protesters outside the KEM Hospital demanded that hiv-positive transgender Kumari Garima be treated well
 doctoron ne use toilet main daal diya tha
 He died the next day
 lachhu kaa kahana he ki koi bhi transgender jitani izzat kama saktaa he, use utani hi sweekaaryata milti he
 The decision of the Supreme Court has given rise to the expectation that when the benefits of reservation in government jobs start to come, then the society will start accepting all transgenders unannounced
 ''kam se kam kaamyaab logon se jude laalach kii vajah se hi log yah sochakar transgenders ko apnaane lagenge ki unke paas pakki naukari, aamadani or ghar he
 "still many questions have not been answered
 kya skulon main transgender shabd kaa istemaal hoga, taaki bachche jaan saken ki third gender bhi hota he? transgenders is sawaal kaa jawaab chaahate hai
 In today's day and time, a decent answer can only be 'yes' and 'yes'

 ’ Cyclone Varada has started wreaking havoc in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh
 landfoll ke dauraan yah tufaan kuch kamjor ho saktaa he
 But due to the storm, heavy rains with strong winds will continue for the next 36 hours
 is saal uttar-purvi monsoon ke dauraan ‘kyant’ or ‘nadaa’ ke baad bengal kii khadi main viksit hone vaala ‘varada’ teesraa chakravaati tufaan he
 Pakistan has named this flower as a flower from the Bay of Bengal
 'varada' shabd kaa matlab arabi yaa urdu main 'laal gulab' hota he
 Earlier storms from Pakistan were named as Phanus, Nargis, Laila and Nilofar, while the storms after Varada are named Butterfly and Bulbul
 is tarah pakistan mahilaon ke naam par hi chakravaati tufaan ke naam rakhata he
 Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones were not named before cyclones
 inke naam rakhe jane kii parampara atlantic mahaasaagar main chakravaaton ke saath shuru hui
 When the wind speed is at least 63 kilometers per hour and it remains for some time, then it takes the form of a cyclonic storm within 3 minutes
 74 mile prati ghante kii raftaar vaale chakravaati tufaanon ko harrican, typhun yaa cyclone ke taur par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 Names are given to cyclonic storms and if they develop as hurricanes, typhoons or cyclones, they retain their names
 harrican, typhun yaa cyclone - ye sabhi ek hi hote hai
 Their names change in different parts of the world
 jaise atlantic main inhen harrican kaha jaataa he, prashanth mahaasaagar main typhun or hind mahaasaagar main inhen cyclone kaha jaataa he
 Story of naming storms The tradition of naming storms that arise in the Atlantic has begun for some hundreds of years
 shuru main caribian dwipon main rahane vaale log is tufaanon kaa naam kisi sant ke naam par rakhte the
 That is, according to the Roman Catholic calendar, the storm was named after the saint of the day on which a storm began
 yah parampara duusare vishwa yuddh tak chali jab mausam vaigyanikon ne tufaanon ke naam mahilaon ke naam par rakhane lage the
 In 1953, the US Meteorological Department formally accepted the idea of naming the names of women falling from a to W, except Q, U, X, y and Z, as storms
 haalanki 60 or 70 ke dashak main tamaam mahila sanghathanon ne iskaa virodh kiya jiske baad 1978 main tufaanon ke naam main purushon ke naam shaamil karne kii parampara shuru hui
 That year the name of the first cyclonic storm began with the letter "A", the name of the second storm started with the letter "B" and similarly the naming started on the basis of alphabet
 sam sankhya vaale varshon main visham sankhya vaale tufaanon ko purushon kaa naam diya gaya jabaki visham sankhya vaale varshon main mahilaon kaa naam diya gaya
 How cyclones are named after them are named by all the warning centers under the aegis of the World Meteorological Organization
 isse mausam vibhaag or aam janata ko mausam se judi bhavishyavaanee, chetavanee aadi ko lekar communication main aasaani hoti he
 There are eight lists for the names of these storms, which are used in sequence and do not rotate every few years
 kuch chakravaati tufaanon ke naam ritair bhi ho gaye hai
 In addition to the Indian Ocean, storm cyclones are named in the world by the Australian region, the Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins
 uttari hind mahaasaagar main chakravaati tufaanon kaa namakaran bhartiya mausam vibhaag karata he
 India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Sri Lanka and Thailand in the Indian Ocean contribute to the naming of these storms
 aise main tufaani chakravaaton ke kul 64 naamon kii suchi he
 According to this list, Myanmar contributed to the naming of Kyant and Oman contributed to the naming of Nada
 kyant kaa matlab 'ghadiyal' or 'nadaa' or kaa matlab 'kuch nahin' hota he
 The names of storms are also retired
 The names of some storms are not used later, which cause large scale loss of life and property
 agar inke naam kaa istemaal karnaa bhi padataa he to kam se kam 10 saal baad
 These names are replaced by new names
 ye naam tufaan main maare gaye logon ke sammaan main ritair kar die jate hai
 Once the name is formally retired, it is replaced by a name starting with the same gender and the same letter
 1972 se abtak 50 se zyada naam ritair kiye ja chuke hai

 desh kii sabase badi adaalat ab shuukravaar kosbarimala mandirmen mahilaon ke pravesh par apana faisla sunaane ja rahaa he
 The Sabarimala temple management, located on the hill of the Western Ghats in Pathanamthitta district, had told the Supreme Court that the entry of women between the ages of 10 and 50 years has been banned because they cannot maintain purity during menstruation
 sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh die jane ko lekar lambey samay se maang uthati rahi he, jiskaa mandir prabandhan lagaataar virodh karata rahaa he
 The matter reached the Supreme Court regarding the entry
 chif justisedeepak mishraqi aguwai vaali 5 sadasyeey bench ne agast main puri sunwaayee ke baad faisla surakshit rakhaa liya tha
 In this case, on 7 November 2016, the Kokarel government had informed the court that it was in favor of the entry of women of all age groups into the historic Sabarimala temple

 The UDF government said that it was in favor of prohibiting the entry of women in the age group of 10 to 50 as this tradition has been in place since time immemorial
 baad main kerala sarkaar ne supreme court main apana paksh rakhte hue ek baar phir mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh par sahmati jataai
 The state government said that the government supports the entry of women of all ages
 tab rajya sarkaar ke is stand par chif justise deepak mishra ne sawaal uthaate hue kaha tha ki aapane chauthi baar stand badla
 Justice Rohington said that Kerala is changing with time

 On behalf of the Travancore Devasam Board it was said that women are not allowed to go to many mosques even during the menstruation stage, even in the mosques
 sunwaayee karte hue chif justise deepak mishra ne travnakor devasam board se kaha he ki board sabit kare ki yah pabandi dharmik vishwaas kaa abhinn ang he
 At the same time, he also asked if women become mellifluous only because of menstruation
 Therefore, banning the admission of women in the temple is against their constitutional rights and dignity
 supreme courtne board ko aade haathon lete hue yah bhi poocha ki kerala hoicourt main to yah kaha gaya tha ki sabarimala ke dev ayyappa ke mandir main salanaa utsav ke shuruaati 5 dinon main mahilaon ke daakhil hone kii chhot he

 is sambandh main nagar nigam ke parshadon ke sammelan main ek prastaav pesh kiya gaya, jisamen madhyapradesh kii aarthik rajdhani kaa naam badalakar 'indur' kiye jane kii maang kii gai
 Municipal Corporation Chairman Ajay Singh Naruka said that BJP councilor Sudhir Dedge said in this meeting, citing historical facts, that the original name of Indore is 'indur'
 isliye shahar ko isi naam se sambodhit kiya janaa chahie
 After this proposal, Dedge has been asked to present historical documents in support of his claim
 iske baad vichaar-vimarsh ke aadhaar par unke prastaav par uchit kadam uthaaya jayega
 Dedge said, 'the city was named Indur because of the ancient Indreshwar Mahadev temple
 lekin angrejon ke galat uccharan ke kaaran shahar kaa naam indore pad gaya jo baad main badalakar indore ho gaya
 He said that Indore has been the capital of former Holkar rulers and many historical documents of the princely period have also described this city as 'indur'

 BJP raised the issue of Jinnah but sugarcane dominated
 yogi sarkaar ne mujffarnagar dange ke aropiyon par cese hataane kaa elaan kiya, lekin jat samudaay kaa dil phir bhi nahin pasija
 As a result, the BJP could not succeed in saving both its seats
 bijepi kaa majboot garh nurpur dhwast ho gaya, sapa is seat par pehali baar khaataa kholane main kaamyaab rahi
 sp's Naeemul Hasan defeated BJP candidate Avni Singh by 6211 votes

 raajnneetik panditon kii maane to jinna kaa mudda ke bahaane bijepi dhruvikaran kii bisaat bichaane main koshish thi, lekin wo apane mansoobon main kaamyaab nahin ho saki
 Whereas the BJP managed to polarize in the wake of the Muzaffarnagar riots in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the graveyard-cremation issue in the 2017 assembly elections
 lekin upachunaav main bijepi kaa ye daanv nahin chal sakaa
 The result of this is that Kairana and Nurpur have had to face severe defeat
 jinna par ganna haaavidrasal, kairana main chini milon kii ore se kisaanon ko unke ganne kaa bhugtan naa kiya janaa bada mudda rahaa

 This sugarcane was purchased at a price of Rs 315-325 per quintal, farmers have not received a single penny as payment in this season
 pashchim upi ko ganna belt kaha jaataa he
 Sugarcane is the main produce of farmers and there was resentment against the government for not paying them
 kairana main chah chini mili hai
 Four mills are owned by private companies
 vahiin do sahakaari kshetra main hai
 In view of the by-elections, the Yogi government pressured private sector sugar mills to take sugarcane of farmers of the entire region
 lekin kisaan ganne kaa bhugtan nahin milane se naaraaz the
 Holding the pulse of farmers, RLD president Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary raised the issue of cane arrears by speaking a dialogue of sugarcane and jinnah at the election meetings of Mahagathbandhan candidate Tabassum Hasan
 isi ke chalate yogi or piem modi ne kaha tha ki ganna kisaanon kaa bhugtan 14 din main karaayenge
 The people of Kairana did not believe in this promise of the government
 isi kaa nateeja he ki bijepi ko karaari maat khaani padi
 The splitting stakes on the riots were a major bet to keep the Jat community with them before the by-election
 yogi sarkaar kii ore se mujffarnagar dange ke aropiyon ke upar se cese hataane tak kii baat kahi
 Apart from this, there was also talk of setting up PAC camps near the camps of Muzaffarnagar riot victims by the BJP
 party kii ore se lagaataar koshish kii ja rahi dhruvikaran kaa daanv fail ho gaya
 The Jat community reposed faith in the rld's Muslim candidate instead of relying on the BJP

 With a century in Sydney, Virat Kohli became just the third visiting team batsman to score four centuries during a series in Australia
 unase pehle harbart stacliff or vaali hamend hi yah karishma dikhaa paae the
 Sachin Tendulkar has more centuries than Virat Kohli from India on Australian grounds, he scored six centuries there

 On talking to Shahid living in this camp, he said that we will not go back even if we kill us here
 shahid ne bataaya ki vah 2012 main bangladesh ke raste hindustan aae the or tabhi se yahaan rah rahe hai
 He told that in the first five years, he did not have any complaint, but for the last two years he is having a lot of trouble

 He says that the police has also taken thumbprints of everyone
 kuch logon ne is form ko nahin bharaa he, lekin dar sabhi ko he ki police, sarkaar kabhi bhi unki basti ko khaali karke unhen baahar kar degi
 These people suspect that if the previous form was in Burmese language, then all this data may have been given to the Government of Myanmar and the process of sending them out soon will begin
 ye log kisi bhi keemat par desh chhodkar jane ko taiyaar nahin hai, haa inkaa ye kahana he ki jab unke apane desh yani myanmar main paristhitiyaan behatar ho jaaengi to ye log bina kahe jane ko taiyaar ho jaaenge

 jindagi or maut
 Both are the truths of nature that cannot be denied
 zindagi maut main badal jaati he or maut zindagi main
 Everyone feels that we never die of mountains
 lekin ye jhooth he
 We also die
 bas hamaari puri zindagi kai pidiyon main bhi insaan nahin dekh paata
 He just feels that we do not die at all
 
 Traces of the devastation that occurred in Kedarnath a year ago can still be seen in the forests around Kedarnath and its surroundings
 is tabaahi kii vajah se bhakton kaa bhagwaan or uske dham se aasthaa ke alaava dard kaa rishta bhi ban gaya
 You have seen and heard many stories about the pain of people, but ever heard their pain, who have been watching this spectacle of life for centuries
 wo jo is kaal chakra ke sabase buudhe gavaah hai
 All water became water
 
 
 dekhte hi dekhte sab pani pani ho gaya
 hotel
 sarai
 Lodge dharmashalaayein
 Roads
 dukaane
 That is, with whose help life is encouraged to see nature closely
 wo saare sahare
 Water became water
 jo log 16 june se pehle kedarnath main the or aaj bhi zindaa hai
 All of them are surprised that what has happened suddenly
 pahaado kaa darkna
 Move ground badalon kaa fatna
 These are the accidents that have always happened in Uttarkashi
 koi nai baat nahin thi isamen
 There is nothing new in them
 lekin jaan or maal kaa itnaa nuqasaan? pal bhar main chaman
 Got deserted
 aisa to tilismi duniya kii kahaniyon main padhaa tha
 Rivers taught humans a lesson in a country that was inundated with a sudden heat, this time the monsoon had knocked it 13 days earlier
 raahat kii ye barish dekhte hi dekhte afat main badal gai
 All the friends of Alaknanda flowing in the waters of Uttarakhand, Bhagirathi, Dhauli, Pinder, Mandakini, Vishnunganga suddenly decided to challenge the man who has become arrogant
 jise lagata he ki qudarat ke din or raat bhi uski banaai sarkaron ke ghulaam hai
 The seasons follow his own ordinances
 suraj, chand, badal, hawaaen sab aage badhane se pehle pradhanmantri, mukhyamantri, cheef ejeeniyar or sarkari babu se ijazat lekar or belgaum thekedaaron ko kuch khilaa-pilaakar aage badhate hai
 But this time, suddenly these rivers decided that they will pak their land from this illegal tampering in the name of promotion
 or phir kudarat ne apana daaman saafe karnaa shuru kiya
 Cleaned all the garbage except the main part of Kedarnath which also has a centuries old dome
 gaurikund qasbe kaa bada hissaa or rambada jahaan betaratib maanav nirmit bhawan or bazaar bad gayi the kaa naamo nishaan mitaa diya
 The same situation happened in Sonprayag, Chandripur and Badrinath
 ufanti nadiyon ke is tandav ne uttarakhand, himachal, uttarapradesh ke kai hisson ko jalmagn kar diya jisamen saikadon logon ko apni jaan se haath dhonaa padaa
 In the name of development, the way life-giving rivers are being tied up, the way in which these rivers descend on the plains, in these mountains, innumerable tunnels are being dug in these wetlands, against them
 This is also angry and warning
 uttarakhand main andhadhundh khudaai va zamin kii kareed-farokhtpichley lagbhag tees saalon main, jabase uttarakhand rajya bana he, vikaas or paryaton ke naam par har tarah kii dukaane khul gai hai
 Land is being bought and sold arbitrarily here
 andhadhundh khudaai chal rahi he
 In the name of electricity, rivers are being constructed by damming them
 vikaas ke liye tehri jaisi pracheen bastiyon kii aahuti le lee gai
 The result is in front
 yani qahar aasamaani zarur tha par buniyaad insaanon ne hi rakhi
 However, even now, such people are often found
 jo hamaari jubaan samajhate hai
 Understand our feelings lekin unki taadaad bahut kam hoti ja rahi he
 Such people can be counted on fingers
 baaqi to hamaare badan se jonk kii tarah lipat jate hai
 And our blood kept sucking till then
 tab tak
 Until their stomachs burst
 kitna badal gaya he sab kuch
 We watch them with surprise
 inke purvaj
 Used to put us with the forehead
 hamaari ahmiyat ko samajhate the wo log
 Those people considered stone to be god
 unhen pataa tha ki ham sanjivaniyon ke rakhwale hai
 We also used to consult them
 unke swaagat main sheesh jhukaate the
 But we saw that gradually his children began to change
 ham jaanate hai ki badlaav hota he
 There is change in us also
 qudarat kii har chiz main badlaav aata he
 Even in customs, in beliefs, in the way of thinking
 har shay main badlaav aata he
 This change sometimes makes death fun
 kabhi zindagi kii kadavaahaten
 But these changes are very mild
 jaise din dhire-dhire raat kii agosh main chalaa jaataa he
 Like the night wakes up in the morning
 or khud ko samet kar takiye ke neeche kahin chupa jaati he
 All the new children of humans want to change in a jolt
 
 
 magar ye insaan kii nai aulaaden sab kuch jatke main badal dena chaahati hai
 And these shocks greatly injure our calm nature
 aisa lagata he jaise ghar main daaku ghus aaye hon
 Those who do not mean anything to the people of the house
 hamen mara hua samaj liya he inhone
 While the truth is that they themselves have become living corpses
 zamin se inkaa rishta tut chukaa he
 They run around on their nerves, running so fast on their carts
 na jane kisi kisi mashine ijad kar lee hai inhone
 These machines just don't have the heart, otherwise they are just like them
 vaise jinke paas dil he unke paas bhi kahaan dil he
 By now you must have understood whose pain we are talking about
 ham aapako un pahaado kii baaten sunwaa rahe hai jo sadiyon se insaani laalach ke gavaah rahe hai
 As we progressed, the pain in his voice and his anger gradually increased
 vaise zaraa sochie ki jo dard inhen mila he wo dard agar samandar ko mila hota to puri duniya main sailaab aa jaataa
 There is a logic behind the foundation of the universe
 There is definitely some logic behind what the creator of this universe has created
 pani jiske bina dharti par jivan kii kalpana tak nahin kii ja sakati uske khazaane usne hamen diye
 From our heights to the depths of the sea, this journey of water gives the whole earth the gift of life
 lekin aaj kaa sirphira or padhaa-likhaa insaan qudarat ke is bhed se munh pher chukaa he
 He wants to make nature his slave
 wo chahta he hawa uske ishaare par bahe
 Rivers proceed by asking him
 samandar uske hukum kaa intezaar kare
 And we mountain
 apane jism main suraakh karavaate rahen
 Staying in the mood of the rivers
 
 
 ab in nadiyon ko hi le lo
 Out of our womb, they have to go to the sea
 or thaharnaa inke mijaaz main inke swabhaav main hi nahin he
 They are not allowed to stay in the workmanship of nature
 unhen to samandar main samaa janaa he
 But man
 insaan ke vigyaan ne
 Learned to make electricity from them
 inhen rokkar inaki raftaar ko or tej kiya
 These rivers supported him to an extent to help humans
 lekin nadiyon kii is madad ko insaan uski kamazori samaj baitha
 Just here she made a mistake
 or us bhul kaa nateeja
 The devastation in Uttarkashi
 jo jaan-maal kaa nuqasaan tumne dekha
 That is the result of this mistake
 or in sab kaa nateeja kya hua
 Suddenly thousands of innocent people
 apni aasthaaon ke saath hameshaa se hamaari panaahon main aane vaale
 Visitor coming
 manant badhaane vaale
 Man woman bachche buudhe
 The soldiers all disappeared in an instant
 prakruti ko majabuuran apana rasta saafe karnaa padataa he
 
 
 We know that a section of you humans is saying that this is the fury of nature
 jo zamin waalon par tutaa he
 But we tell
 hamase zyaada kisne dekha he
 The history of centuries is recorded in our chest
 ham bataate hai ki hamane kabhi qudarat ko qahar barasaate nahin dekha
 Did not see the devastation
 jab jab insaan ne qudarat ke saath budtameezi kii he
 Of indecency, then, then nature has presented a small sample of his anger
 wo bhi chetavanee ke liye
 But where are you humans going to believe
 lekin yaad rakhana
 This nature
 ye prakruti jeene ke liye sab kuch detii he
 But when a human tries to stop his path, he is forced to clear his path
 ye tabaahi ye jaan-maal kaa nuksaan jo tumne dekha
 Payment ye qudarat ke usee gusse kaa sabase chota namoona he
 Which is just trying to say that be careful
 hosh main aa jaao
 So that you do not have to see doom before time

 There has been a lot of discussion since the beginning of the year about the trailer of Shah Rukh Khan's film Raees, which will be released next year
 jab se film main shahrukh ke don avatar ko jari kiya gaya he tab se hi phans main is film ke trailor ko dekhne kii utsukata bad gai he
 But now Shah Rukh himself has shared a video in his brilliant look in the film and has informed that when and how he will be interacting with the fans about this film
 shahrukhis video main kehete najar aa rahe hai ki unhen pataa tha ki phans film kii pehali jhalak kaa kab se intjaar kar rahe hai lekin ab sirf 7 disambar tak kaa intaar karen or vah khud is film ko lekar logon ke sawaalon ke jawaab denge wo bhi aamane saamne
 In fact, Shah Rukh Rais's trailer will interact with the audience through video conferencing on the day of release
 7 disambar ko relies hone ja rahe is trailor ko deshbhar ke 3500 screens main dikhaaya jayega
 On this occasion Shah Rukh will meet with viewers from 9 cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Jaipur, Moga Punjab, Indore and Ahmedabad through video conferencing
 saal 2017 main janvari ke aakhri hafte main relies hone vaali'rais' main shahrukh khanke alaava mahiraa khan or navazuddin siddiqui mukhya bhoomikaaon main hai
 The film is directed by National Award-winning director Rahul Dholakia
 'rais' kaa nirmaan ritesh siddhvani or farhaan akhtar kii excel intertenment or shahrukh- gauri khan kii red chiles intertenment kar rahi he
 Watch this brilliant video of Shahrukh's Raees with a release date: centre sarkaar main number 2 or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kareebi samajhe jane vaale vitt mantri arun jetali or bijepi ke rajyasabha saansad subramanyam swami ke bich chal rahaa cold war ab khulkar saamne aa gaya he
 Arun Jaitley's tweet, which came to the defense of the government on most of the cases, made it clear that he was in the mood for an all-out fight with Swamy
 jetali ne twit kiya ki 'vitt mantralay ke ek anushaasit afasar ke khilaaf anuchit or jhuthe aarope lagaae ja rahe hai
 Jaitley, who jumped in the tweet, actually had to answer Jaitley after Swami attacked Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das after RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan and Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian
 kisi ne twitor par likhaa ki shaktikanta das ne desh kii bahut seva kar lee
 Now they should be sent back to Tamil Nadu
 is par swami ne likhaa ki mere khyaal se unke khilaaf ek cese lambit he
 In which he helped p Chidambaram grab land at important places in Mahabalipuram
 swami kaa ek ke baad ek vitt mantralay se jude adhikariyon par morcha kholana jaahir he
 The finance minister passed away and he too jumped into the Twitter war
 is puure maamle ke baad bijepi or sarkaar ke bheetar charchaa shuru he ki kyonsubramanyam swamivitt mantralay ke bahaane sidhe arun jetali ke saath do-do haath karne ke mood main hai
 After all, why is the party silent on Swamy even speaking against the minister who is considered to be number 2 in the government and the party? Jaitley protested against Swamy joining BJP
 This story started when Swamy was included by BJP in the party Made up his mind, which was openly opposed by Arun Jaitley
 sutro kii maane to swami ke paksh main aresas kaa puraa vot tha kyonki naa sirf swami ram mandir mudde par vakaalat karte rahe balki gandhi parivaar ke khilaaf morcha kholana bhi ek vajah rahi
 The story got interesting when a senior minister in the government started supporting Swami despite Arun Jaitley's reluctance
 yahaan tak kii swami ke saamne jetali se unhen rajyasabha saansad banaae jane par raay maangi gai jiskaa jetali ne virodh kiya
 Jaitley refused to send Swamy to the Rajya Sabha on the BJP seat, saying that Swamy's words would trouble the government daily
 party or sarkaar ko unke bayanon par safai deni padegi
 In politics, the enemy's enemy is a friend
 yahi bijepi main bhi hua
 Jaitley's detractors in the party and the government openly supported Swamy and today it is a matter of fact that Jaitley, as finance minister, has been alone in defense of the officers of his ministry
 party ho yaa sangh chup rahakar game dekh rahi he
 According to sources, the Sangh had asked Home Minister Rajnath Singh Koswami to talk to Swami vs Jaitley to cool off the fight, after which Swamy went to Rajnath's house on Wednesday to meet him
 swami ko rajnath kaa kareebi bhi mana jaataa he lekin guuruuvaar ko subah se swami ne phir is masale par ek ke baad ek twit karke saaf kar diya ki wo kisi ke samajhane main aane vaale nahin hai
 PM Modi will have to break the silence
 It is clear from the reply of Arun Jaitley that now this battle between the two has come to the point in which the party and the Prime Minister will not be able to remain silent for much longer
 kyonki vipaksh se pehle khud arun jetali ye jawaab jarur maangenge ki aakhir swami kiski shah par ye sab kar rahe hai
 Today is the eighth day of Arvind Kejriwal's fast

 anna ne manch par pahunch kar arvind kii koshishon kii tarif kii or kaha ki kuch dinon baad unhen anshan chhod dena chahie kyonki sarkaar to chaahati hi he ki ham mar jaaen
 But we don't have to die, we have to keep fighting
 anna ne kaha ki arvind or unke raste alag ho sakate hai lekin manzil ek hi he
 Speaking about Arvind's health, Anna Hazare said that Arvind has to recover again and continue the fight and he is with Arvind
 anna ne ye bhi kaha ki arvind garibon ke liye lard rahe hai
 Fighting for common people

 Facebook, the company that runs the world's largest social network, is about to come up with a new digital currency
 pichley hafte company ne libra naam kii ek nai karency laane kaa elaan kar diya
 This plan of Facebook was first discovered about a year ago when it placed Facebook Messenger head David Marks in the blockchain project
 duniyabar main is project ko lekar tarah-tarah ke kayaas lagane shuru ho gaye the
 But all those speculations came to a halt on Tuesday last week when Facebook said that it is going to launch cheap currency so that money can be sent abroad very cheaply and easily
 libra puri tarah se na to bitakwine jaisi kryptokarency hogi or na hi maujuuda bainkon kii tarah kaam karegi
 In the beginning it will be a mixed form of these two
 fasebuk kaa daawa he ki ise kaarobaar jagat se lekar aam aadmi aasaan or surakshit tareeke se paise kaa lenden kar saktaa he
 Neither bank nor middlemen will be required for this
 philhal videsh main paisa bhejne par ausatan saat fisadi rakam bank or bichauliye ke rup main kaam karne vaali companiyaan sarvice charge ke naam par le jaati hai
 The service charge is worth about $ 50 billion
 pehle se is dhandhe main lage bainkon or baaki vittiya sansthaaon ko dar he ki libra unhen baahar na kar de
 However, the libra has not been launched yet and the information about its arrival has been seen by bank regulators and governments around the world with suspicion
 fasebuk ke liye duniya bhar main apana sikaa chalaanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 However, the Libra, which is launched next year, has targeted a total of $ 613 billion in cross border transactions
 digital note jari karne kii is yojana main fasebuk akele nahin he
 About 27 large companies, including Visa and Uber, stand alongside Facebook in this large global payment system
 har company kam se kam ek karod dollar laga rahi he
 The new currency is overseen by the Libra Association, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland
 fasebuk ne keval karency hi nahin launch kiya he balki ek electronic batua (wolet) calebra bhi laanch karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 There will be many such wallets for Libra, one of them will also be Facebook's Calibra
 libra krypto karency nahin helebra krypto karency isliye nahin he ki kyonki ise kuch log niyantrit karenge
 Whereas in crypto there is no such system
 vah puri tarah se dycentrulij hoti he
 The only thing that distinguishes it from the current system and its similarity to the crypto currency is the blockchain ie electronic ledger
 blockchen ek tarah kii technology he, yah ek plateform he jahaan digital karency yaa kisi bhi cheez ko digital banaakar uskaa record rakhaa ja saktaa he
 That is, blockchain is a digital laser
 vahiin bitaqoin or libra ek tarah se digital madhyam he, jiske jariye koi cheez kharidi yaa bechi ja sakati he
 The blockchain was designed in 2008
 isamen prayek block ek megabite par fiks hota tha
 Now technology to increase the speed of transaction is awaited
 lenden kii speedblocchen takanic ke bare main bataate hue sanjay sharma kehete hai, "bitcoin prati second sirf saat lenden (transactions) kar saktaa he
 In comparison, Libra can do 1000 transactions per second
 is dauraan bitcoin kaa mulya teji se ghatata badhata he, lekin libra majboot pakad ke saath apana mulya sthir rakh saktaa he
 The purpose of the libra is that the public accept it
 iske liye libra kaa focus mukhyat: pratiyogi tranjection fees or sthir mulya par he
 "more than a hundred private companies Facebook will not be alone in this payment system
 visa, ubar samet sau se zyada privet player honge jo is system ko monitor karenge
 Currently they number about 27, but there are plans to take it to a hundred
 philhal libra ko koi kanoonee aadhaar nahin mila he or na hi sarkaron kaa samarthan
 In such a situation, the path of this new digital currency will not be easy

 It is based on the famous battle of Saragarhi, which took place in 1897 between a small contingent of the British Indian Army and the Afghan army

 Do this question yourself
 sabase pehle kya aayaa tha aapke dimag main jab aapako pataa chalaa kivasundhara ke rajya kaa aadmi, kejariwal kii dilli main, modi virodh ke bich bhari bheed main maaraa gaya
 See, we also identify places with politics and also those who die
 aapane bhi yahi kiya tha? yaa kahin ye to nahi sochaa ki falaan kii mushkilen badhengi, dhikaane par ungali na uthe? agar haa, to aapke andar bhi kuch mar rahaa he
 Leave was angry? Is valid
 jimmedaari se koi nahi bhaag saktaa, un netaaon par gussa jaij he, jo bajaay kisi marate ko bachaane ke bhaashan de rahe the
 Questions are made to the Chief Minister whose farmer of the state goes to another state and commits suicide
 us pradhanmantri par gussa jaij he jo achche dinon kaa vaada kar baitha he or kisaan pehle kii tarah mar rahe hai
 Questions arise on the functioning of the police, even on the media flashing camera
 us netaa se bhi jaij he jo kah rahaa he ki wo kisaano ke saath khadaa he, bhale uski sarkaar main hui mauton par kabhi usne munh na kholaa tha
 But are anger and complaints enough? Ask yourself again, can you do this anger neutrally? Without prejudice? Without seeing interest, see that your favorite person is in front of your questions
 aisa mauka kisi ko nahi milegaa,par khud se sawaal jaruri ho jate hai
 Time passed and things came to light
 kisaan nahin, vyapaaree tha, ghar-parivaar kii samasyaayein thim
 Had previously contested the election, had been asked to watch it at home on TV
 ashutosh kaa bayaan suniye, kejariwal kii baaten suniye, dilli police or grahamantri ke bahaane suniye, phayda uthaane ko aatur congress ko suniye
 Politics was never so disgusting
 aapako ghin aati he is sabase? hajaar bate hai
 Let us admit that the farmer was not, but was the person to die? There were common people in the rally, BJP was targeted at them, then went to the Congress at the funeral
 dilli police thi, media thi, bhaashan the, camere the, grih mantralay he, saamne dilli sarkaar he
 There are statements, allegations, excuses, complaints, there is just another human being, who is not seen anywhere in this crowd, who would have saved the first one
 khud se sawaal kijiye kya aap wo duusare insaan hai?ham mautein dekhne ke aadi ho gaye hai

 Akhilesh Yadav, popularly known as Tipu in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, has not received any politically sound news for him since the day he took over as the National President of the Samajwadi Party
 party par varchasv ke liye parivaar ko daanv par laga chuke akhilesh yadav chunaav-dar chunaav nayaa prayog kar rahe hai, lekin unka koi bhi prayog safal nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Exit polls that came before the results of the current Lok Sabha elections are also testimony to the failure of Akhilesh Yadav's biggest decision
 ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole main upi kii 80 siton main se sapa-basapa gathbandhan ko mahaj 10-16 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 This is the data that is not only going to upset BJP opponents, but will give a headache to Akhilesh Yadav himself
 isse kahin zyada akhilesh yadav kii raajnneetik samaj or faislon kaa bhi yah litmus test mana jayega
 Because on the own, Akhilesh Yadav, who has gone from the stream of Mulayam Singh Yadav, who sparked the politics of Samajwadi Party, has not been successful in his intentions
 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main congress se gathbandhan2012 main akhilesh yadav pehali baar upi ke mukhyamantri bane to unhone vikaas kaaryon par jor diya or 2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav aate-aate 'vikaas bolta he' jaise naaron par chunaav bhi ladaa
 Not only this, Akhilesh Yadav not only took the command of the Samajwadi Party in his own hands, keeping uncle Shivpal Yadav aside, but UP is also the slogan of choice, joining hands with Rahul Gandhi to challenge BJP and BSP
 gave
 upi ke donon ladakon ne milakar vidhansabha kaa chunaav ladaa lekin modi ke naam par bijepi kii aisa hawa chali ki sabhi virdohi dharaashai ho gaye
 Therefore, Akhilesh Yadav's first political decision failed after getting the sp's command
 rahul gandhi ke saath akhilesh yadavais haar ke baad akhilesh yadav ne ek aisa faisla liya jisaki kisi ne kalpana bhi nahin kii thi
 Against BJP, SP-BSP and RLD came together in the by-elections in Kairana, Phulpur and Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats
 ye formula chal niklaa or teenon siton par bijepi haar gai
 This victory sparked anti-bjp camp and the idea of SP-BSP alliance was born
 is idia ko akhilesh yadav ne anjaam tak pahunchane kaa kaam kiya
 In Aaj Tak's interview, Akhilesh had said that he had to make this alliance in any case
 gathbandhan formula ke tahat basapa ne 38, sapa ne 37 or areldi ne teen siton par chunaav ladaa jabaki amethi va raibareli seat congress ke liye chhod di gayi
 Akhilesh also campaigned extensively with Mayawati
 yahaan tak ki mayawati or mulaayam singh yadav ko bhi akhilesh ek manch par le aae
 Election results like the 1993 SP-BSP alliance were also discussed when the slogan was 'meet mulayam-kanshi Ram, Jaishreeram in the air' Are extremely disappointing
 agar yahi anumaan nateezon main badalte hai to akhilesh yadav kii raajnneeti kaa doosraa or sabase ahm prayog bhi kafoor ho jayega
 The packets of Namo food made everyone go out of mind as they went inside the polling booth
 jab tak ham media vaale kuch samaj pate tab tak palak jhapakate hi dibba gaayab
 It was not known where those packets were kept in the three polling booths inside the luxurious club of Noida Sector 15A
 haalanki, wo baad main poling party ke pet main hi gaye
 But what is Namo food, how did it come to be, these questions were churning, so it was inevitable to get inside
 subah koi saade nau kaa vakt tha
 BJP candidate from Gautam Budh Nagar and Union Minister of State Dr
 mahesh sharma vot daalane parivaar ke saath aae
 Media clashes and supporters' part
 
 Meanwhile, a van stopped, dozens of food packets were taken out of it in big bags of polythene and directly inside the club house
 
 Namo food was printed on the food packets in the bags
 chaunkna lajimi tha, lekin hamane dekha ki us par kisi netaa, kaaryakarta yaa hasti kii tasviir nahin thi
 Later news came that similar packets of Namo food were also brought for polling parties in Ghaziabad
 hamane bhi chunaav ayog ko twit kar tasviir ke saath isaki jaankaree di ki aakhir ye kya maajaraa he
 After 2 hours, the commission said that it has nothing to do with the Election Commission or the code of conduct
 kyonki ye koi puraani form he jisane namo food ke naam se hi apana pratishthan registerd karaayaa he
 In such a situation, neither the code of conduct can spoil it nor the commission
 ab ham noida sector-2 sthit namo food pahunche
 When Sunil Anand, the manager of this food chain, got a call, he was eating himself
 wo bhi bhaage-bhaage 5 minute main pahunche
 When he told them the whole thing, he too smiled
 unka kahana he ki ye to kareeb sava saal purana pratishthan he
 Now there are 5 branches of this food chain in Noida and Greater Noida
 naam ko lekar baat chali to hamane puch liya ki aapane bhi vahi soch kar naam rakhaa jo sab sochate hai
 Sunil Anand smiled and said that no, our thinking is related to Sanskrit Namo Namah, which directly means hello and welcome
 unhone ye bhi joda ki hamaara logo yani pratik chihn bhi jude hue haath hai
 But political is fija, everyone seeks and implements political matters
 hamane phir poling party ko khangala
 An official said that because of Navratri, most of the officers wanted to eat vegetarian
 unako bataaya gaya ki iskaa khaanaa sahi he
 So we ordered food online from there
 ab unki baat kitni sach he kitna fasaana, ye to unka dil hi jane
 Now, who will win or lose in the election, then we have to wait till May 23
 lekin ye to tay he ki namo food kii to chal nikali

 Referring to the failures of GST, Sinha said that Jaitley should resign from the post for the difficulties faced by the countrymen, adding that the people of Gujarat feel burdened by Jaitley
 aapako bataa den ki arun jetali gujarat se hi rajyasabha sadsy chune gaye hai

 purv kendriya vitt mantri sinha ne kaha ki bhartiya arthvyavastha ko notebandi or jiesti ke rup main ek ke baad ek do jatke lage he
 Yashwant Sinha was called to Gujarat by activists associated with the 'lokshahi Bachao Andolan' to discuss the impact of demonetisation and GST and the current state of the economy
 sinha ne ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha, ‘hamaare vitt mantri gujarat se nahin hai or vah yahaan se rajyasabha main chune gayi hai
 He is a burden on the people of Gujarat
 agar unhen yahaan se nahin chunaa jaataa to ek gujarati ko mauka miltaa’
 He said that the Finance Minister believes in only one system 'chitti bhi meri, patta bhi meri'
 sinha ne kaha ki agar jiesti kii daren tay karte samay uchit tareeke se dhyaan diya jaataa to is tarah kii visangatiyaan or araajaktaa se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 He said, 'he cannot take credit for implementing a deeply flawed tax system in the country and the people of this country have the right to raise the demand that they should leave their posts'

 To deal with women's crimes and to punish the culprits in time and to bring justice to the victims, a bench of the Supreme Court Chief Justice has taken reports of the Center and all the state governments through suo moto writ
 supreme court ne centre or rajyon se nirbhaya fund kaa byoraa bhi talab kiya he
 Through this self-cognizant writ petition, the court said that the delay in justice creates unrest, anger and impatience in the minds of the public
 chif justise bobade, justise biaar gawai or justise sooryakanth kii peeth ne is rit ke hawaale se ye bhi kaha he ki nyaay prakriya kii pechidagi kii vajah se nyaay milane main deree janata ke man main ashaanti, gussa or aakrosh paidaa karti he
 The court said that the Nirbhaya case shook the entire country
 iske baad janata kii bhaavana ko dekhte hue sansad ne kanoon main bhi badlaav kiya, lekin nirbhaya cese aaj tak antim padav par nahin pahunch paaya
 However, this is not the only case
 justise bobadene kaha ki agencia logon ke gusse ko dekhakar teji se kaam karti hai
 The Supreme Court has taken this big step on the delay in judicial process in cases of rape by women
 chif justise bobade ne deshbhar main mahilaon ke khilaaf ho rahe aparaadh kii ghatnaon par swatah sangyaan liya
 Notice to the Central and State Governments: The Chief Justice has issued a notice to the Central Government and all the states, saying that the existing laws, systems and methods of police action need to be strict and accountable
 itnaa hi nahin peediton ko behatar medical suvidhaayen sunishchit karnaa bhi praathamikta main hona chahie
 In the notice issued to all the states including the Center, the Chief Justice has said that 32559 rape cases were reported across the country in 2017 which are very worrying
 chif justise ne sabhi rajyon ke mukhya sachivon or police mahanideshkon se maujuuda kanoonee karrwai ke tareekon ke bare main states report talab kii he
 The court has also asked the states that what has been the police action in crimes against women? How fast is it? What is the ratio and percentage of convictions? The court has also sought to know how the prosecution is working
 How many forensic agencies are there and what means of investigation do they have? How accurate, modern and scientific is the technology? How much staff and how trained
 mukadmaa samay par darj na karne yaa mukadmaa naa darj karne vaale kitne pulisavaalon ke khilaaf kya kya karrwai hui? yani kitne nilambit hue or kitne barkhaast
 The court asked that what is the method and means of medical treatment and medical examination of the rape victim? Do all the hospitals have the prescribed medical kit for the medical examination of the rape victim and the accused? Do all private and government hospitals give free treatment to the rape victim or not? What is the figure of hearing only in the courts of a woman judge? rajyon ke ravaiye se court naarajaitna hi nahin rajyon ke sust ravaiye se naaraaz oe pareshaan supreme court ne rajya sarkaron se poocha ki unke yahaan vishesh adaalatein kitni hai? uname fast trek kitni hai? mukademon ke tezi se niptaare kaa aankada kya he? saath hi yah sunishchat karne ke liye kya kiya ja rahaa he ki trial jald or tay samay main puraa ho jaae
 The court has also sought to know in the notice sent to the states that what is being done to ensure the presence of lawyers in cases of rape or exploitation by women? The Supreme Court has also directed the Registrar General of all High Courts to cooperate in this work

 Diwali is one such big festival which film celebrities also eagerly wait for
 aisa hameshaa dekha jaataa he ki holi, id or christmas kii hi tarah diwaali par relies hone vaali filmein box offis par tabadatod kamai karti hai
 The film 'prem Ratan Dhan Payo', released on the occasion of Diwali in the last year (2015), grossed 240 crores and the opening collection of the first day of the film was 44 crores
 isse pehle saal 2014 main relies shahrukh khan kii film 'happy new year' ne 45 karod kii opening di thi
 Now in 2016, two big films are going to be held at the box office on the occasion of Diwali
 ek taraf he lav, romance or drama se bharpoor karan johar kii multi-starer film 'i dil he mushkil' or duusari taraf he ajay devgan kii ection packdfilm 'shivaay'
 Is 'shivaay' the upper hand? The teams of both the films are busy in promotion
 trade analist maanate hai ki donon filmein 12 se 14 karod ke bich kii opening dengi
 But somewhere in view of the ongoing debate on social media, it seems that 'shivaay' has the upper hand, the biggest reason is the presence of Pakistani actor Fawad Khan in the film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil'
 halanki karan kii is romantic drama film ke actors ranbir kapur, aishwarya raay or anoushka sharma kii fain folowing laajawab he
 But still a large part of the audience is seen cutting it from being a Pakistani actor
 is film main banate-bigadate rishton kii kahani dikhaai gai he
 On the other hand, 'shivaay' is the second film directed by Ajay Devgn
 is ection-adventure film ko ajay pita-beti kii kahani maanate hai
 By the way, if we talk about music, Karan's film is far ahead of Ajay's film and its music youth has liked it very much
 filmon ko kiya ja rahaa he international level par pramotbat agar global market kii ho, to ajay devgan ne is baar interneshnal marketing kaa dhyaan rakhte hue apni film ko bharat ke saath-saath interneshnal level par bhi pramot kiya he
 However, Karan is not far behind in this matter
 trade analist kaa maananaa he ki filmon kii laagat ko dekhte hue box offis hit hone ke liye 'i dil he mushkil' ko kam se kam 110 karod kii kul kamai kerani he, jabaki 'shivaay' ko safal hone ke liye 130 karod kaa collection karnaa hoga
 One can get the benefit of not staying in contrast, for example, Karan Johar's films are meant for multiplex audiences
 lekin 'shivaay' ko single screen or multiplex donon ke darshakon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaya gaya he, jiskaa phayda film opening main achche se uthaa sakati he
 The biggest thing is that the name of 'shivaay' was not heard in any of the contrasts, while 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' was in a lot of controversy because of Fawad Khan
 philhal to ab ise sabhi rajyon main relies kiya ja rahaa he
 Ajay may get the benefit of joining hands with eros
it is also worth noting that Ajay Devgan has joined hands with Eros International for the big opening and release of his film, while Karan Johar's 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' has someone Not a co-producer
 baaki ab donon filmon kii parformens kisi rahegi, yah to teen din baad saamne aa hi jayega
 The moon is the most influential planet on the Earth
 iskaa sidhaa asar vyakti ke man or sanskaron par padataa he isliye chandramaa se banane vaale ek ek yoga itane zyada mahatvapurn hote hai
 Three types of auspicious yoga are made by the moon - Anfa, Sunfa and Durdhara and an inauspicious yoga is also formed - Kemdrum
 kundali main kemdrum yoga ho to bahut saare shubh yoga nishphal ho jate hai
 It gives mental pain and impoverishment to the person
 kaise banataa he kemdrum yoga or iskaa prabhaav kya hota he?- chandramaa ke donon taraf koi grah na ho- tathaa us par kisi grah kii drushti na ho to , kemdrum yoga ban jaataa he- aisi dasha main vyakti ko maansik rog yaa maansik pidaa kaa saamana karnaa padataa he- kabhi kabhi apilepsy jaisi samasya bhi ho jaati he- vyakti ko daridrata kaa saamana bhi karnaa padataa he- dhan ko lekar khub utaar chadhaav hote hai- iske kaaran vyakti ko mata kaa sukh nahin miltaa- kemdrum yoga kark , vrishchik or min lagn main zyada karaab hota haikab kemdrum yoga bhang ho jaataa he? Sai Baba of Shirdi is counted among the great men of the twentieth century
 garibon, dukhiyaaron or anathon kii niswaarth bhav se seva karke unhone apane aalochakon tak kaa dil jeet liya tha
 He had no harm in the service of humanity
 unhone apane is kaam main dharm ko kabhi aade nahin aane diya or har dharm tathaa samudaay kii chupchaap seva kii
 He made Shirdi village of Maharashtra his workplace and stayed there for the rest of his life
 vah hinduon ke saath diwaali manaate the to musalamaanon ke saath id
 He did not deal with anyone on the basis of religion and devoted his life to the weak and proletariat
 unhen hindu-muslim ekta kaa ek jwalanth misaal mana jaataa he
 He believed that God is one, whatever the religion
 yahi kaaran he ki unki lokapriyata badhati gai or ve ek fakir se poojaneey mahapurush kaa darja paane main safal hue
 Today he has a large number of followers in the country and abroad
 shiridy sthit unke mandir main lakhon bhakt har saal unki aradhana karne or aashirwad maangane aate hai
 It is no small matter that a fakir quietly serving the poor and helpless in a remote village in Maharashtra becomes so popular in the country that people give him the status of God
 lekin ab shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ne unke bare main tarah-tarah kii baaten kahkar ek anaavashyak vivaad ko janm de diya he
 He says that the worship of Sai Baba is a conspiracy to divide Hinduism and foreign forces are behind it
 isse hindu dharm kamjor hoga
 While making the statement Shankaracharya forgot that Hinduism is already a divided religion on the basis of caste and traditions and no concrete steps are being taken even today to unite it
 aaj hindu dharm main tamaam tarahaki kureetiyaan, andhvishwaas or galat paramparaon ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he lekin shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati unke bare main kuch nahin bolte
 In the Hindu religion in which women are worshiped, they have the worst plight
 dharm ke naam par dhan kamaane kaa silsilaa jari he or saikadon farji baba desh ke kone-kone main vicharan kar rahe hai, unke bare main unhone kyon nahin munh kholaa? bade-bade mandiron main bhakton se jis tarah se paise anthe jate hai uske bare main unhone kabhi kuch kyon nahin kaha? sai baba ko vah guru bhi maanane ko taiyaar nahin he or uske peeche unke tark bhi ajeeb hai
 He says that Guru is idealistic and Sai Baba was not like this
 yah saraasar galatabayani he
 Very few people can achieve the ideals that Sai Baba established
 unka yah kathan ki britain hinduon ko baantnaa chahta he, nihaayat hi gairjimmedaarana he
 He should behave like a true Hindu, as an icon of tolerance and kindness, not as an intolerant and narrow-minded person
 shankaracharya kaa pad bada hota he or usase hameshaa acchhee tathaa vidvatapurna baton kii apeksha kii jaati he
 Swaroopanand Saraswati is better off making statements only after understanding this fact
 goraksha ke naam par bane sanghathanon par pratibandh lagane kii maang ko lekar daayar janhit yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 Tehsin Poonawala and two others in the petition have sought to stop violence against Dalits and minorities in the name of cow protection and said that such violence organizations should be banned in the same way as the organization like SIMI

 Uncle's daughter has come to the drawing room to do homework
 umdaa oonee topi, foole hue mulaayam sweater, kandhe se latakati do chotiyon or juutenuma maujon main vah bahon main kas lene ke liye paryaapt pyaari lag rahi he
 He has the smell of taking a bath in his body just now
 gazab kii thand he
 It may be an illusion, but i think in the winter we fall in some extra love for the fragrances
 sambhav he, is mausam main nasika taaqatvar ho jaati ho
 It is like a crime to spend five sentences to explain one thing, so understand the bottom line from the fourth, that winter is the most suitable for me to feel fragrance, that's all
 kittu ko laad karne ke baad main is mausam vishesh par sochane lagata hum or smritiyaan mujhe skool le jaakar chhod detii hai
 At that time, i used to recognize and remember a lot of the same things
 pencil kii khushboo
 Smell of rubber
 itihaas kii second hand kitaab or teacher ke dastakhat kii khushboo
 Like any unannounced rule, i had to take everything near the nose
 sardiyon main khaane-pine kii garma-garm chizon ke saath ham yun bhi isi tarah pesh aate hai
 Our eagerness in tea, soups, greens and vegetables smells a little bit, and while eating them, we also keep on smelling a little
 adarak bhi fasinet karne lagata he
 i remember, with the arrival of winter, a new kind of fragrance would have been experienced when sweaters were removed from the shelves
 dhoop dikhaane se pehle ke sweater mujhe sirf isliye pasand the ki waisi khushboo kahin or nahin milti thi
 At school, my friends who used to always peel or erase pencil, smelled like pencil or rubber
 unke paas hone kaa pataa lag jaataa or yaad aa jaataa tha ki unhen pencil chhilne or rabar ghisne kii aadat he
 We knew who would get which rubber, whose rubber would be cloaked black and who would have the red one
 sahpaathiyon kii pahchaan kii ek paddati yah bhi thi
 The mixed scent of pencil-rubber contained a strange type of thing, which could not be in perfume
 jis din yah khushboo nahin aati, hamamen se koi kahata, 'lagata he aaj ve nahin aae'
 Then a voice came from somewhere, 'we have come, but forgot to bring our pencil-rubber'
 jab main kalam se likhane kii umr main aayaa, to syaahiyon kii khushabuon main farq samajhane laga
 i remember, i wrote beautiful words on the 'pair-page' of Hindi-copy with the smell of credit, which took me minimal time to remember
 maa padhane ko kahatee, to copy main munh ghusaakar baith jaataa or pasandida syaahi kii gandh se haraa-bharaa sa mahasoos karne lagata
 The smelling ink in blue was some purple and the red one was pink
 jaise khushboo ne syaahi ke rang ko dialut kar shararti bana diya ho
 This mustache was like a 'golmali thrill' of seeing Ram transform into black
 main usamen mast ho jaataa
 Helping Kittu in homework
 vah copy ke behad qareeb jaakar likhti he
 During this, his head remains diagonally
 bich-bich main vah sir uthaati he or meri ore munh banaakar muskura detii he
 i used to spend life on the smell of young children's cheeks
 ghar aayaa koi mehmaan baccha saath laata, to main khil uthta
 Struck his nose and kissed him on his cheek
 maa sabko bataatin, ise bachche bahut pasand hai
 These were the most prevalent fragrances of my life then
 acha-acha sa lagata tha, jab pencil-rabar kii gandh vaali saheliyaan baaju main aakar baith jaati thim
 Used to insist on a happy sketch-pen
 usase muskuraate hue joker main rang bharta tha or apni haasyaaspad duniya ke ek kone main khadaa hokar gambhirtha se sochataa tha ki sketch kii khushboo ko yahaan na hokar, logon ke sharir main hona chahie
 Of each one maine kai baar chaha tha ki apni duniya kii mukhtaliff khushabuon ko ek-ek karke doston main baant duun
 i wanted those children to smell the same, with whom i was forbidden from playing
 jivan kii gudh-ujjad-kachi khushabuon se tab meraa zyaada paala nahin padaa tha
 But he never suffered from any inferiority complex towards him
 ab bhi yah na samajha jaae ki main gandhon ke astitv ko achchhai-buraai main vargeekrut karke dekhtaa hum
 Taking a bath or hand sanitizer from detaal has never been like a man who, with great feudal confidence, considers himself to be the most hygienic
 meri duniya main or bhi kai khushbuin thim, jo ab thik-thik pahchaan main nahin aatin
 Thinking about them is the only option
 haalanki main nahin jaanata ki gandh kii kalpana kaise kii jaati he
 Kittu would know those fragrances better
 khushabuon ko darj karne kii meri kshamta ab ghat gai he
 It is also possible that all the fragrances are being recorded in a memorial somewhere very fast and at some stage of their age they can be seen
 antee mere liye kesar vaala doodh lekar ai hai
 The cafeteria is still buzzing
 kittu pencil chhil rahi he

 The people of Gujarat have given a wonderful decision
 bijepi to gujarat main 150 siten jeetne ke daawey kar rahi thi, lekin gujarat kii janata ne in badbhole daavon kii hawa nikaalkar bijepi ko 99 ke pher main fansaa diya
 The people gave Gujarat an absolute majority government, as well as strong opposition
 darasalgujrat main bjpki ye vaaki abhootpurv jeet he, jaisi jeet pehle nahin hui, waisi jeet he
 Wins the least distance in 22 years
 2002 main gujarat kii 127 vidhansabha siten jeetne vaali bijepi to is baar teen ankon tak bhi nahin pahunch pai or 99 ke pher main funs gai
 The people of Gujarat have done wonders, they have given power, but they have given strong opposition as well, only then Congress President Rahul Gandhi is giving up the sleeves even after losing
 gujarat main bijepi kii sarkaar banane kii agar naubat ai he to uskaa sabase zyada credit pradhanmantri narendra modi ko hi jaataa he, to vahiin congress agar gujarat main itani majboot banakar ubhari to uske peeche congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii bahut badi bhoomika he
 For the first time, Gujarat became the face-to-face battle of Rahul Gandhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the first time, both of them sweated heavily in the election campaign, so the results also came accordingly
 pradhanmantri narendra modine 34 reliyaan kin, jabaki rahul gandhi ne gujarat main 30 raily kii
 Prime Minister Modi reached 134 seats in Gujarat, while Rahul Gandhi could reach 120 seats
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke daure vaali 134 siton main se 72 par bijepi kii jeet hui, jabaki jin 120 siton tak rahul gandhi pahunche, unamem se 62 siton par congress pratyaashee kii jeet hui
 Looking at the success figure, Modi's success percentage was 54, while Rahul could get his party 52% success
 gujarat kaa ye chunaav kai myne main abhootpurv rahaa
 In this election both BJP and Congress got many lessons, politics on the basis of caste and religion also got a lesson
 virodh or samarthan kaa sara ganit badal gaya
 Muslim lot 18 seats BJP won 9 seats, while Congress won only 7 seats
 is baar 31 fisadi patidaar matadaata bijepi se khiskkar congress ke saath ho liye, jiske chalate bijepi ko 15 siton kaa nuksaan hua
 Out of 54 Patidar-dominated 54 seats, Congress won 30 seats, while BJP got only 23 seats
 patidaaron ke chhitakane kii vajah se saurashtra main bijepi ne 12 siten ganvaa deen
 The Congress had taken Patidar leader Hardik Patel, OBC leader Alpesh Thakor and Dalit leader Jignesh Mewani on caste lines
 lekin hardik patel ke prabhaav vaali 37 siton main se 25 par bijepi kabiz ho gai, jabaki congress ko sirf 9 siten milin
 In the obc-dominated 38-seat battle, BJP got 17 and Congress got 21 seats
 dalit bahul 7 siton main se bijepi ko 7 par jeet mili, jabaki 6 siton par congress ne jeet darj kii
 The election campaign of the Congress in the election of Gujarat had progressed rapidly, but a statement by Mani Shankar Iyer turned the dice in the second phase
 haalanki congress ne manishankar ayyar ke bayaan par damege control karne kii koshishen bahut kin, lekin pradhanmantri modi ne chunaav main ise mudda bana liya
 Modi redressed the issue of lowliness in the Surat and surrounding areas, where he was most opposed
 nateeja ye hua ki bijepi ko surat or aasapaas kii 16 siton main se 15 par jeet mil gai
 The Congress had nothing to lose in this election, which is why Rahul Gandhi was on the front foot throughout the election, attacking the policies of the Modi government fiercely
 rahul gandhi kii baaten gujarat kii janata ne sunin, thik se sunin
 Congress may not get power in Gujarat, but this election is a big lesson for BJP
 gujarat main bijepi ke sabase majboot yuva vot bank main congress send laga chuki he
 This time in Gujarat, 38 percent of the voters between the ages of 18 and 40 fell to the Congress, whereas in 2012 only 25 percent of the youth of Gujarat were with the Congress
 yahi nahin, gramin ilaakon main congress ne jabardast dhamak jamaai he
 Out of 127 seats in Gujarat's rural areas, Congress and its allies have won 68 seats
 jabaki bijepi in ilaakon main 14 siten ganvaakar sirf 56 siton par simat gai
 These results of Gujarat elections say a lot
 bijepi ko satta to saunpi, lekin 99 ke pher main fansaakar aage ke liye kadaa sandesh bhi de diya

 Far from being recognized for gay marriages, the big thing here is that you get married to your neighbor
 jis mulk main aap apni marji se dasvin ke baad vishay nahi le sakate, gharon main ulte haath se likhnaa-khaanaa bhi vidroh mana jaataa he, vahaan samalangik vivaah dur kii kaudi hai
 Gay marriages cannot be recognized in India, even if they get legal recognition, society will never recognize it
 samaaj bade maje kii cheez he, sadak par khun main lathraate pade rahiye samaaj aadhi aankh na dekhegaa, vahiin charadivari ke bheetar kya ho rahaa he isaki bhanak lagate hi uski ankhen fat kar flower ho jaaengi
 Once a society is called gay, even if there are gay marriages, then the mixed aunt of the neighborhood will not recognize it
 samalangik vivaahon ke raste main sabase badi baadha samskruti or sabhyataa hai, jo bade pokhare kii machhlee ko zukam ho jane par bhi khatre main pad jaati hai, usase aage badhen to ek baadha ye bhi he ki samalangik vivaah hone par dahej koun legaa or dahej koun degaa? maaen ek baar ye jhel sakati hai ki ladkaa ge he or uskaa byaah ho jane do lekin ye kabhi na jhel paaengi ki ladke ke byaah main buaa ko fatty banarsi sari bhi na aae
 If the mothers are silenced by promising to get the ring to their aunt, then it will be difficult to find a partner in their religion, if religion comes out, it will have to be seen which caste is it, duty be the next one has also found the partner of his caste and religion
 So it has to be seen whether there is any endogamy

 The fast bowler proved that he still has old power by taking 16 wickets for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League
 unhone chennai super kings ke khilaaf final main antim over main apni gendbaaji kaa kamaal dikhaaya, jisase mumbai chauthi baar ipel khitaab jeetne main safal rahaa

 New captain Dimuth Karunaratne's first main goal will be to re-join Malinga and re-join the team so that he can perform at his best
 malinga ne vishwa cap main kuch yaadgaar pradarshan kiye hai
 He created a sensation in the World Cup 2007 against South Africa by taking four wickets in four balls
 iske baad 2011 main kenya ke khilaaf unhone phir se hetric lee
 His first spell in the final against India was dangerous when he dismissed Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag early
 agar srilanka 1996 kaa itihaas dohraane ke bare main sochataa he to malinga kaa feet or form main hona jaruri he
 This will probably be Malinga's last World Cup

 This young leader, Sanjay Lather, 40, who successfully conducted the stage by speaking Hindi in Haryanvi style and drawing the attention of the local people, did not make so much headlines for the work as in the past one and a half months from the post of the national president of Yuvjan Sabha
 Have been raised in order to be removed and reclaimed
 ek maah ke bheetar is pad par dobaaraa kabiz hokar lathar sapa ke yuva netaaon ke bich sabase zyada prabhaavshaalee rup main saamne aae hai
 Born in Julana village of Jind district of Haryana, Sanjay Lather is one of the few young leaders who have set foot in politics on their own
 patrakarita main piechdi samet paanch vishyon main master degree hasil karne vaale lathar haryana kii chaatr raajnneeti kii dein hai
 During this time he came in contact with Haryana socialist leader and former Chief Minister Hukum Singh
 “kum singh ne lathar ke saath milakar june, 1992 main haryana main samaajawaadee party kaa gathan kiya
 When Mulayam Singh Yadav formed the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh in November 1992, Hukum Singh merged his party with it
 tabhi se lathar mulaayam singh yadav ke kareeb pahunch gaye
 Lathar became the Chief General Secretary of the Samajwadi Yuvjan Sabha in Haryana
 1998 ke aam chunaav main unhone haryana kii sonipat loksabhaa seat se sapa ke tikat par chunaav ladaa or tisare sthaan par rahe
 After this, Mulayam Singh made Lather the national president of the Samajwadi Student Assembly in 2002
 yahi vah vakt tha, jisane unke kadamon ko uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti kii ore badhaayaa
 Though Lathar was disappointed with the Julana seat of Haryana in the 2005 assembly elections, he gave a new direction to the Samajwadi student movement in Uttar Pradesh
 chaatr andolan main badi sankhya main pichde varg ke netaaon ko aage laane kaa shrey bhi unhen hi jaataa he
 Last year, when the party started preparing for assembly elections, Akhilesh Yadav tasked Lathar to manage his election campaign
 lathar ke sahyogi or samaajawaadee lohia vahini ke rashtriya adhyaksh anand singh bhadauria bataate hai, ‘’akhilesh yadav ne vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan puure pradesh main 100 se zyada reliyaan kin
 The crowd gathered at every rally, but there was no chaos at all
 isse unke chunaav prabandhan kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 After the assembly elections, the SP fielded Lathor in the by-election in Mathura's Manat assembly seat, which was vacated by the resignation of National General Secretary of National Lok Dal Jayant Chaudhary
 june main hue is upachunaav main lathar ne haar kii tikdi puri kii
 But the special thing is that he got more than 50,000 votes in the election, whereas in the main election held three months ago, the SP candidate from the same seat had to be satisfied with only 1,200 votes
 maant vidhansabha upachunaav jeetne vaale trinmul congress netaa shyaam sundar sharma bataate hai, ‘‘chunaav main sanjay lathar ne jis tarah se paisa bahaya, usase main hairaan hum’’mukhyamantri karyaalay main sachiv ke pad par tainaat prabhaavshaalee iees adhikari anitha singh ke kareebi hone se bhi lathar ke prabhaav main badhotaree hui
 Among the sp's young leaders, only Lathar is the leader who is allowed to visit the Chief Minister's office unhindered

 However, Lather dismisses all the allegations leveled against him, saying, "I did not get any charge sheet after being removed from the post of president
 shaayad maant vidhansabha upachunaav main vyast rahane ke kaaran main sabha kii nai kaaryakarini nahin ghoshit kar sakaa
 This is why i was removed
 ” magar dobaaraa yuvajan sabha ke rashtriya adhyaksh kaa pad sanbhaalane ke baad gathit hui kaaryakarini main jis tarah se badi sankhya main party ke nishthavan yuva kaaryakartaaon ko kinare kiya gaya he, usase lathar kii pareshaaniyaan philhal khatm nahin hone vaali
 The socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia, who laid the foundation of the Samajwadi Yuvajan Sabha, may never have imagined that the leader who took command of this will roam in expensive cars like Landcruiser and Prado in future
