 uttarakhand or himachal pradesh main kai jagahon par badal fatne or baari barish se koharaam machaa hua he
 Landslides have broken mountains and fallen on roads in many places
 uttarkashi, lamabgad, bageshwar, chamoli or tehri main to halaat bahut bure hai
 Schools and colleges are closed
 mausam vibhaag ne aaj yani somvaar ko bhi barish kaa alert jari kiya he
 Clouds burst at several places and people are reported to be buried under debris
 andiaref or esadiaref kii team ko maukey par ravaanaa kar diya gaya he
 Do you know what is called cloudburst? Why does the cloud burst? What happens with this? a cloud burst does not mean that the cloud has broken into pieces
 mausam vaigyanikon ke anusaar jab ek jagah par achaanak ekasaath baari barish ho jaae to use badal fatna kehete hai
 You can think of it that if a balloon filled with water is burst, all the water starts falling down in one place
 thik vaise hi badal fatne se pani se bhare badal kii boonden teji se achaanak jameen par girti he
 It is also known as flash flood or cloud burst
 achaanak teji se fatkar barish karne vaale badalon ko pregnant cloud bhi kehete hai
 Why does a cloud burst suddenly? Anywhere a cloudburst occurs when clouds with too much moisture stop at one place
 vahaan maujuud pani kii boonden aapas main mil jaati hai
 The density of the cloud increases with the weight of the droplets
 phir achaanak baari barish shuru ho jaati he
 Cloudbursts can cause rain at a speed of 100 mm per hour
 kyon zyaadaatar badal pahaado par hi fatate hai?pani se bhare badal pahari ilaakon funs jate hai
 Clouds are unable to move due to the height of the mountains
 phir achaanak ek hi sthaan par tej barish hone lagati he
 It rains more than 2 cm in a few seconds
 pahaado par amuman 15 kimi kii oonchai par badal fatate hai
 However, the extent of cloudburst has mostly never been recorded beyond one square km
 pahaado par badal fatne se itani tej barish hoti he jo sailaab ban jaati he
 Water does not stop on the mountains, so water comes down rapidly
 neeche aane vaala pani apane saath mitti, keechad or pattharon ke tukade le aata he
 Its speed is so fast that everything facing it is wasted
 sirf pahaado par hi nahin fatate badal, maidani ilaakon main bhi fatate hampahale dharna thi ki badal fatne kii ghatana sirf pahaado par hi hoti he
 But this perception has changed after a cloudburst in Mumbai on 26 July 2005
 ab yah mana jaataa he ki badal kuch khaas sthitiyon main fatataa he
 Wherever those conditions are formed the cloud can burst
 kai baar badal ke maarg main achaanak se garm hawa kaa jhonka aa jaae to bhi badal fat jate hai
 The incident in Mumbai was caused by this

 dubai kii metro train main 67 saal ke ek bhartiya ko sirf isliye yatra karne se roak diya gaya ki usne dhoti pahan rakhi thi
 According to Madhumati, daughter of the victim, a policeman stopped her near the punching gate of Etisalat metro station last Sunday and said that the dress her father was wearing is not allowed here and he cannot wear it in the metro 
 samachar patr ‘gulf news’ ke anusaar madhumati ne kaha, ‘‘maine pulicekarmi se aagrah kiya ki hamen andar jane diya jaae, lekin usne hamen ansuna kar diya
 It is really embarrassing and my father was very upset
 ’’ He said that he made every effort to convince the policeman that the dhoti is a traditional Indian veneer, covering the body completely
 tippaniyan Madhumati said that her father has wandered here in the metro wearing dhoti many times, but no one had stopped
 sadak evam parivahan praadhikaran (artie) ke anusaar yatra ko lekar koi dress code tay nahin he
 Madhumati has formally filed a complaint in this case
 peedit vyakti kii beti madhumati ke anusaar beete ravivaar ko etisalaat metro stesan ke panching get ke nikat ek pulicekarmi ne unhen roka or kaha ki unke pita ne jo pahanava pahan rakhaa he, uski yahaan ijaajat nahin he tathaa vah yah pahanakar metro main nahin ja sakate hai
 According to the newspaper 'gulf News', Madhumati said, "I requested the policeman to let us in, but he ignored us
" vaaki main yah sharminda karne vaali baat he or mere pita bahut pareshaan the
 '' unhone kaha ki unhone pulicekarmi ko yah samajhane kaa puraa prayaas kiya ki dhoti ek paaramparik bhartiya libaas he, jo sharir ko puri tarah dhakati he
 The comments madhumati ne kaha ki unke pita yahaan kai baar dhoti pahanakar metro main gum chuke hai, lekin kisi ne nahin roka tha
 According to the Road and Transport Authority (RTA), there is no dress code for travel
 madhumati ne is maamle main aupchaarik rup se shikaayat darj kara di he

 Last month, the Delhi government increased the salaries of the Imams of the capital, so now the turn has come to shine politics in its name
 dilli vakf board ne imaamon ko bulaayaa to dilli sarkaar kaa kaseeda padhane ke liye lekin isaki jagah kai imam selary ab bhi naakaafi hone par ulte bifer pade
 Seeing anger, CM Sheila Dixit assured the Imams to increase every year, while Waqf Board chief Matin Ahmed told Babaki that if the benefit is from the Imams then why should the Congress not get political gains
 imaamon kii mehfil main shila dikshit kii siyasat chamak rahi he
 Although this is not a political process, yet when the elections are coming and the Imam is together, it is also necessary to have a political debate
 isliye manch se imaamon ne bhi shila ke virodhiyon ko kya-kya nahin kah daalaa
 Overall, the Congress is eyeing the Muslim vote bank this time too
 jo pichley saal hue emsidi chunaavon main khisakta nazar aayaa tha
 But whether the sweetness of the showers is visible, whether its sweetness will be tasted by the Congress or not, this is a big question
 film 'mere brother kii dulhan' do bhaaiyon kii kahani he
 Love living in London, Ali Ali Zafar, after a breakup from Gulfrand


 to assign his bride to younger brother Kush


 ie Imran Khan


 who is in India
 kush kii khoj dimple yani katrina caff par aakar khatm hoti he
 Like many of the Yash Raj banner films


 between a lot of songs


 the atmosphere of marriage is set
 lekin shaadi kii shopping karte-karte kush ko ehsaas hota he ki usamen or uske bhai kii mangetar ke bich pyaar kii kashish he
 Three years ago, director Onir made the film 'sorry Bhai' on this subject
 lekin sori bhai


 bold seens se bhari film thi jabaki riter diarector ali zafar kii 'mere brother kii dulhan' lite harted romantic kamedi he
 Here the Indian audience will not feel the pressure of the bold subject
 bade aahiste se katrina kii chahat ek se duusare bhai kii taraf badhati he
 There is no shock anywhere
 friendli open streetforward or bindaas katrina ke kairactor main notines or inocense kaa acha mixture he jisaki badaulat aap ye film muskuraate hue dekhenge
 There is also a spoof of Shahrukh from 'my Name Is Khan'
 sweet sobar or kanfujd bhai ke role main ali zafar impressive hai lekin unhone dev anand jaisaa mecharism kyon apanaaya
 The film also has some drawbacks
 kuch seens ekadam imprectical or immeor hai
 The heroine even manages to kidnap the hero
 kahani slo bhi he
 And at the climax, when the end of the film appears



 tab bhi kahani aage badhati rahati he
 Then Youthful and spicy-filled 'mere Brother Ki Dulhan' can be seen and my rating for this is 3 stars
 kalakaar − katrina caff imran khan ali zafar diarector − ali zafar Given the sluggish demand for loans in the industry, the country's largest bank SBI can refrain from lending in the coming festive season
 state bank of india kii cheirperson arundhati bhattacharya ne kaha, ‘udyog jagat main acchhee maang hone par ham iskaa phayda lone lene vaale chote graahakon tak pahunchaate hai
 If the demand for loans in the corporate sector is sluggish, then where will we give cheaper loans
 ’ unhone sanket diya ki maujuuda samay main kuch khaas lone ke liye byaaj daron main katautee kii gunjaaish bahut simit he
 The bank may explore the possibility of offering concessions in other charges such as processing fees
 bhattacharya ne khudara bazaar main jabardast pratispardhaa kii ore bhi dhyaan dilaayaa jisase tyohaari sijan ke dauraan lone kii byaaj daron main kami aane kii gunjaaish simit ho jaati he
 He said that the bank's products are already at the 'lowest level' and to reduce rates further, the base rate may have to be reduced, which is not possible at the moment
 gauratlab he ki SBI ne is maheene kii shuruyaat main apni jamaaon kii daron main chauthai fisadi kii katautee kii thi
 The case of the body of a student found in a high profile society in Ghaziabad has become a mystery for the police
 is maamle main premika ke parivaar par hatya kaa aarope laga he
 The charge is of honor killing
 dilli se rajasthan or upi tak maamle ke taar jude hai
 The deceased boy was a student of Bachelor Degree Second Year
 19 varshiya vishaal do din pehle gajiabad ke porsh ilaake kii sevier socity main upar se neeche aa gira
 Surprisingly, Vishal neither lived here nor did any of his relatives or friends live here
 police ko bhi samaj nahin aayaa ki vishaal yahaan kaise aayaa
 Kilashvishal was identified on Thursday
 vishaal ke parijan guuruuvaar ko gajiabad aae or vishaal kii shinaakht kii
 Vishal, who hails from Sikar, Rajasthan, was last seen in his Tau's home in Uttam Nagar in Delhi on May 2
 aarope he ki beeti 1 tarikh ko wo apane pados kii is ladki ko lekar taaoo suresh ke ghar dilli ke uttam nagar ilaake main aayaa or kaha ki donon shaadi karnaa chaahate hai
 The girl's family had refused to marry
 Tau of Vishal also called the girl's family from Rajasthan
 2 may ko ladki ke parijan vishaal ke taaoo ke ghar pahunche
 The family members of the girl who reached Tau's house said that these two cannot get married
 unhone kaha ki wo vishaal or ladki donon ko saath le ja rahe hai
 They will instruct Vishal and send him back in a while
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Vishal's corpse arrived in the high-profile society late on 2 May
 vishaal ke parijanon kaa aarope he ki vishaal kaa katl ladki waalon ne kiya he
 This is a case of honor killing
 29 april ko vishaal apni kathithpremicaco lekar ghar se bhaaga tha
 The Rajasthan Police was also informed about this
 lekin achaanak is tarah se wo taaoo ke ghar gaya or vahaan se premika ke parivaar ke saath chalaa gaya
 After this, no one can understand what happened after his body was found
 police ke liye bhi maamla pechida ho gaya he
 What really happened in this story of death between Rajasthan to Delhi and then to Ghaziabad in UP is all a matter of investigation
 ladki ke parivaar vaale fararbataya ja rahaa he ki ladki ke parivaar vaale faraar hai
 Police has sent a team to Rajasthan for investigation
 vishaal kii laash copost martmke liye bheja gaya he
 But if it is really a case of honor killing, then it is clear once again that Vishal has been punished for death in the form of love

 According to its captivity, it was the 20th of this month
 raat ke tab thik saadhe 10 kaa vaqt tha
 a Santro car was parked in such a way that no one could leave without stopping
 shaayad nikalne vaala bhi nahin tha
 Except Brij Bhushan, who is in the Delhi Tourism Department
 unke aane kaa vakt tha
 The murderers got out of the car in the leisure, sensing the outside environment and taking their positions
 teen baahar or ek car ke andar
 The murderer was standing in front of death when the CCTV camera, first the headlight of the car and then Brij Bhushan's wagon-r stood at exactly where the murderer wanted
 bas qaatilon ko isi pal kaa intazaar tha
 Brij Bhushan's car did not stop that the three attackers standing outside crashed on the car
 car main baithe is chauthe kaatil ne bhi tamancha nikaal liya
 All the killers were fearless but unaware that the CCTV camera installed in this building above their head is capturing every moment
 ab tafsil se dekhte jaaiye ki kaise ye hamalavar nihathe brijbhushan par maut banakar barase
 First of all, this attacker took the front seat towards the driving seat of the car as soon as he stopped and broke the glass first by taking out the hammer without stopping and then using hammer on Brij Bhushan 9 times in a row
 car ke peeche kii taraf maujuud topi pahane is badmaash ne apane mojey main chipaaya hua chaaku nikaala
 Immediately sitting on the back seat of the car and closing the door, he continued to attack Brij Bhushan with a knife

 When Brij Bhushan died on three sides
 thik usee vaqt sentro car main baitha chauthaa hamalavar bhi lagaataar tamanchey se goli chalaakar ek jatke main hi is kaam ko tamaam karne kii firaaq main tha
 With this intention, he took out a number of occasions, but Brij Bhushan was not under the control of a crook
 is afra-tafari main kahin nishaanaa chook kar uske saathiyon ko hi na lag jaae
 He could not fire
 haalanki aakhir main use goli chalaane kaa mauka mil hi gaya
 One after the other, he fired two bullets at Brij Bhushan
 chaaku hathode or tamanchey kaa istemaal karne ke baad bhi brijbhushan kaatilon se ladate rahe
 The attackers were afraid of being caught in such a situation
 or bhaagane kii jaldbaazi karne lage
 The CCTV located in this locality building was being captured and how the three murderers who got into Brij Bhushan's car started running out of the car in fear of being caught and the fourth attacker sitting in the saturn car started the car and proceeded
 magar kareeb sava minute tak hamale par hamalaa jhelane ke baad bhi brijbhushan ne hosh nahin khoyaa
 He left the driving side and ran to the left side of the car to save his life
 brijbhushan kii himmat se haar chuke in hamalaavaron ne jate jate car ke darvaaze se brijbhushan ke baahar nikle hue pair ko kuchalanaa shuru kar diya
 He was trying to get them out of the car
 aisa nahin kar paaya to unke chehre par tamanchey se waar karne laga
 These pictures captured in CCTV have been talking about how 4 armed miscreants are helpless even in front of a wounded man
 maarna to dur hamalavar brijbhushan ko besudh bhi nahin kar paa rahe the
 Eventually the murderers had to leave the Mouka-e incident in this condition
 kareeb dhaai minute tak tabadatod jaanaleva hamalaa jhelane ke baad bhi brijbhushan apni car se baahar nikle

 In Rajasthan, BJP can make a big change in both the government and the party

 It is now believed that the BJP is going to change the government and organization in view of the elections in December

 The BJP state president Ashok Parnami's leave in Rajasthan is being decided after the defeat in the by-election, but it was not agreed on who should give the Rajasthan BJP command after Parnami's removal

 It is believed that some new ministers can be included in the assembly constituencies where the BJP has been defeated, and those ministers can be discharged and sit on the caste equation

 After this meeting, instead of coming to Jaipur, Vasundhara Raje has gone straight to her house in Dholpur
 ise lekar bhi kai tarah ke kayaas raajnneetik galiyaaron main lagaae ja rahe he
 Although BJP has made it clear that Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje will remain and there is no intention of changing the leadership in the state, but the way the central leadership of BJP is interfering in the politics of Rajasthan, it has also become clear that Vasundhara Raje Now free hand is not available

 ' khud ko bhartiya bataate hue britain main janme lekhak aatish ali taasir ne kaha ki sarkaar kii aalochana karne kii vajah se unka osiai card waapas liya gaya
 Let us tell you that only last week, the government had withdrawn the 'overseas Citizen of India' (OCI) card of Aatish Taseer
 sarkaar kaa kahana tha ki unhone (taasir ne) kathith taur par yah tathy chupaaya ki unke pita pakistani mul ke the
 This step was then taken
 grih mantralay ke ek pravaktaa ne bataaya ki naagarikta adhinium 1955 ke anusaar, taasir osiai card ke liye ayogy ho gaye hai kyonki osiai card kisi aise vyakti ko jari nahin kiya jaataa he jiske mata-pita yaa dada-daadi pakistani hon or unhone yah baat chipa kar rakhi
 The spokesperson had stated that Taseer (38) clearly did not meet the very basic needs and concealed the information
 naagarikta adhinium ke anusaar, agar kisi vyakti ne dhokhe se, farjivada kar yaa tathy chupa kar osiai card hasil kiya he to osiai card dharak ke rup main uskaa panjikaran radd kar diya jayega or use kaali suchi main daal diya jayega
 Also, there will be a ban on her entering India in future

 The spokesperson also denied that the government was considering canceling the OCI card of Aatish Taseer after writing an article in Time magazine

 An official of the Government Railway Police said that four gangmen of the railway were hit by a suburban train going to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminal

 Rupali Ambure, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Railway, said that according to preliminary information the accident occurred when these four contracted personnel of the railway were walking along the tracks between Kurla and Vidyasagar railway stations
 ambure ne bataaya ki mritkon kii pahchaan shravan bahu (18), kashinath (19), gokul (18) or naanaa (27) ke rup main hui he
 All four were hit by the karjat-cst local train

 'no investigation is likely' Another senior railway official said that it is unlikely that the incident will be investigated as it is a case of 'trespassing'
 unhone kaha, 'niyantran kaksh ko praapt soochna ke mutabik ye majdoor raat kii duty kar sandherst road stesan se laut rahe the
 It seems that perhaps they could not see the moving train because it was dark at that time

 The charge of the Congress took advantage of the demonetisation, when Ajay Doval's son Nemanjit Thakur Guru came to Jairam Ramesh to talk to reporters at the Congress headquarters, he had a paper in his hand
 muskuraate hue ramesh ne vah parchaa dikhaaya or bataaya ki yah 2011 kii ek report he jise taiyaar karne vaale shaks aaj rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar hai
 Apparently, he was referring to Ajit Doval
 us report main kaha gaya tha ki kaale dhan ko ujagar karne ke liye sabhi tex haiven (aise desh jahaan se bharat main nivesh karne par karon main riyaayat milti he) se aane vaale nivesh ko ujagar kiya janaa chahie or saath hi in tex haiven par nigahabaani kii jaani chahie
 Ramesh then turned to reporters and said that Vivek Doval is the son of the National Security Advisor and just 13 days after the date of demonetisation, he formed a company called gny-asia and deposited funds in the Cayman Islands through this company
 haalanki, tex haiven main dhan jamaa karana bhartiya kanoonon ke mutabik abhi gaiyr-kanoonee nahin he
 But Ramesh presents some facts further
 unhone kaha, caiman island jaise tex haiven se bharat main nivesh kaa aankada kuch nae ishaare karata he
 Between 2000 and 2017, about Rs 8300 crore
 kaa nivesh desh main hua
 But within a year of demonetisation, the same amount has been invested in India
 ramesh kehete hai ki sarkaar ko or bhartiya rigerv bank (arabiai) ko caiman island se aae nivesh kaa byoraa saarvajanik karnaa chahie, taaki pataa chale ki kis company ne bharat main kitna nivesh kiya he
 The Congress leader said that the establishment of the company immediately after demonetisation and then the investment of such a large amount of doubt creates doubts and in such a situation its truth should come out
 ramesh aage kehete hai ki jienvai-asia ke do nideshkon main ek vivek dowaal to hai hi duusare don dablyoo

 He says a prime minister in the neighboring country of Pakistan has to face the wind of jail when he is named in the Panama Papers
 aise main sarkaar agar eemaandaaree kii baat karti he to is sandarbh main tathyon ko saamne laana chahie
 Ramesh expresses apprehension that there is a suspicion of roundtripping of money in this entire episode
 bhaajapa par aarope lagaate hue ramesh kehete hai, is party main netaaon ke putr par bhrashtachar ke aarope hai
 Be it Abhishek Singh, Dushyant Singh, Anurag Singh or Ajit Doval's two sons
 chunaav ke thik pehle aise sawaal bhaajapa ko asahaj kar sakate hai
 Especially, if the party presents itself against corruption

 After the success of Heropanti, the expectations of everyone, be it the industry or the audience, increased from me, so i thought it better to take a careful step

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said that he is ready to bat at number six and thus indicated that his team is preparing to field five bowlers in the first Test against England starting here on Wednesday
 dhoni ne paanch maichon kii siries ke shuruaati test se purv sandhya par mangalvaar ko kaha, 'mujhe chathe number par ballebaaji karne ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie kyonki yah match main ahm charan he, jahaan se aap match kaa rukh badal sakate hai
 'he said,' If you start getting some boundaries and you bat positively with other batsmen then it is good and this is the time of the match when you can score some runs fast because the ball gets a bit old
 And bowlers get a little tired
 lekin aapako sunishchit karnaa hoga ki aapako acchhee shuruyaat mil jaae or mahatvapurn baat he ki aap isse phayda uthaa sako
 Dhoni said, "there are very few teams that play with five bowlers
" isaliye yah khud main hi badi chunauti he
 It is fantastic to have five bowlers outside the sub continent and we will see the wicket tomorrow only then we will decide
 ' iskaa matlab he ki bharat saatven number par ol round vikalp ke taur par stuart binni ko khilaa sakate hai
 Bowling-batting can do both
 Binny, when Binny's name was called for this option, Dhoni responded by turning slightly
 dhoni ne kaha, 'stuart aisa khilaadi he jo thodi gendbaaji kar saktaa he or saath hi ballebaaji bhi kar saktaa he
 If you give him good chances and pursue him, he can become a player who can show us a good game for the next six-eight months
 vah jaik kallis kii tarah shandaar nahin hoga lekin vah aisa khilaadi hoga jo 10 over gendbaaji kar saktaa he or thodi ballebaaji bhi kar saktaa he
 'feeding five bowlers will give India a chance to help in the bowling attack of its three bowlers and a spinner who had trouble in South Africa and New Zealand
 team johanisburg or aaisland main jeet kii haalat main pahunch gai thi lekin in maichon main jeet darj nahin kar saki thi
 On the bowlers, Daromdardhoni said, "we had to play with three fast bowlers and a spinner and if the pitch is not bouncing then the fast bowlers have to jointly take a lot of responsibility
 agar aap in test maichon main dekho to tej gendbaajon ne apni sarvshereshth gendbaaji kii
 But sometimes in cricket you also need some luck
 hamen vipakshi team ko shrey dene kii jarurat he lekin overol mujhe lagata he ki gendbaaji vibhaag ne acha pradarshan kiya tha
 When Dhoni was asked if the absence of Zaheer Khan increased the odds of a non-experienced bowling attack, he said, "good thing we got some time to adapt to the conditions here
" hamane pichley 10-12 din main fitness par kaaphi kaam kiya
 Now we are going through a phase where we are losing a bit of weight from the fast bowlers
 ' unhone kaha, 've sahi kshetra main gendbaaji kar rahe hai or yahi mahatvapurn cheez hai
 Overall they look good
 ummid he ki hamaari team main khilaadiyon ko zyada chotein nahin lagen jaise ki 2011 main pichhali siries main hui thim
 i remember that our top players had close to nine or 10 injuries
 'ishanth kii bhi tarifdhoni ne ishanth sharma kii bhi tarif kii
 The Indian captain said, "as far as Ishant is concerned, he is bowling well
 acchhee lay hasil karnaa bahut ahm he
 So far he is bowling well and he is a player who can get more bounce than some of our other bowlers

 In all the surveys, the results of the Karnataka assembly elections have been estimated to be hung
 ab satta bazaar main bhi zyaadaatar buki karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main trishunk vidhansabha par daanv laga rahe hai
 According to the Rs 3,000-crore betting business line newspaper, many bookies believe that the BJP, which won 40 seats in 2013, may more than double its number of seats this time, but will not be able to get the majority figure to form a government
 gauratlab he ki satta bazaar ek avaidh bazaar he, jahaan chunaavon ko lekar bhi satta lagane kaa khub khel chalata he
 Many bookies say that the betting business for the Karnataka elections could reach around Rs 3,000 crore
 jedy (es) kii madad se sarkaar banaaegi bijepi!karnataka vidhansabha main 224 site hai jisamen bahumat ke liye 113 siten jaruri hai
 a bookie told the newspaper, 'we are relying on Amit Shah's strategic acumen and we believe that with the help of Deve Gowda's JD (S), the BJP will form the government as the result could be a hung assembly
 'bijepi ko kareeb 95 siten milane kaa anumansatta bazaar kaa apana ek alag akalan hota he
 In December 2017, when it seemed that the BJP would win a good win in the Gujarat elections, the bookies of Satta Bazar had predicted the BJP seats to be less than they had anticipated
 is baar bhi buki kaa kahana he ki karnataka main bijepi 95 siton ke aankade ko paar nahin kar paaegi
 If the BJP is betting on winning more than 95 seats, then the bookies are also betting on it that it will not get less than 80 seats
 jedy (es) ke 20 seat jeetne kaa daanv lagaaya ja rahaa he or bookies ko yah bharosa he ki yah party sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi kaa saath degi
 Significantly, the Congress has 122 seats in the legislative assembly
 lekin is baar anti inakambency or anya kai vajahon se buki congress kii siten kaaphi kam hone kaa andaja laga rahe hai

 After this, with the help of a relative, he filed a case on Friday night at the Kamla Nagar Police Station
 unhone kaha, iske baad hamane aadhi raat ke baad aaropee vyakti or mahila ko giraftaar kar liya
 Police said that the victim is currently staying at her relative's house

 unhen ye chintaa sata rahi hoti he ki kahin bachche ko thand to nahin lag rahi yaa kahin use saans lene main takalif to nahin ho rahi
 But now there is no need to worry
 ab bazaar main ek aisa upkaran aa gaya he jo aapaki in sabhi chintaaon ko dur kar degaa or aapako bachche kii har activity kii soochna detaa rahegaa

 It gives the last 24-hour figure
 is mimo system ko navjaat se lekar ek saal tak ke bachche ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he

 karnataka ke mukhyamantri ke apane kaarykaal ke dauraan avaidh khanan main kathith taur par shaamil hone ke ek maamle main lokayukta police kii jaanch ko chunauti dene vaali videsh mantri esaem krishna kii yachika par ucchtam nyaayalay 24 april ko faisla sunayega
 Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice SS Nijjar had stayed the proceedings against Krishna against the FIR
 raahat die jane se karnataka ucch nyaayalay ke inkaar kar dene ke baad krishna kii yachika par ucchtam nyaayalay ne purv main kaha tha, ‘ham kaarywahi par roak lagane ke liye pravrutt hai
 As a result, proceedings on the basis of the FIR lodged in the case on the order of Karnataka Lokayukta will be stayed
 ’krishna ne apni yachika main ucch nyaayalay ke 20 janvari ke aadesh ko chunauti di thi
 The bench said that the order of investigation by the Lokayukta police was 'premature' as the proceedings before the Lokayukta were 'incomplete' as the supplementary report was not submitted
 notebandi kaa maamla supreme court ne paanch jajon kii bench ko saunp diya he or vibhinn hoicourt main chal rahi sunwaayee par roak laga di he
 But it is a matter of relief for the government that the court refused to increase the limit of circulation of old notes in essential services
 court ne ise puri tarah sarkaar par chhodte hue kaha ki ye sarkaar jimmedaari he or sarkaar ko samvedansheeltaa se is par uchit nirnay lenaa chahie
 The Supreme Court has asked the government on the issue of demonetisation to ensure that people get Rs 24,000 from banks every week and review this system from time to time
 haalanki supreme court ne mukhya nyaayadhish samet teen jajon kii bench ne vibhinn hoicourt me lambit maamalon kii sunwaayee par bhi roak laga di he
 The court said that no other court in the country will hear the note closure case
 sabhi maamlesupreme courtsunegaa
 The court has issued notice to the parties in all the cases and sought answers
 lekin sarkaar ke liye buree khabar yah he kii sarkaar ke faisle kii nyaayik samiksha ke liye notebandi maamle ko paanch nyaayadhishon kii samvidhan peeth ke paas bheja diya he
 The court has prepared 9 questions, on which the constitutional bench will hear
 sarkaar ke liye buree khabar isliye he ki pehle sunwaayee ke dauraan atorni general mukul rohtagi ne adaalat se kaha tha kii aarthik maamalon main liye gaye sarkaar ke faislon main nyaayalay samiksha nahin kar saktaa
 But the court has ordered a constitutional bench to review the case
 shuukravaar subah yachikakartaon kii taraf se varisht edwocatokapil sibbelane adaalat se anurodh kiya tha ki aavashyak sevaaon ke liye 500 or 1000 ke puraane note se pement kii chhot kii miyaad badhaane ke liye court sarkaar ko nirdesh de, lekin court ne ye faisla sarkaar par chhod diya

 The SIT team probing the Panchkula violence case of Haryana interrogated Gurmeet Ram Rahim's Samadhi and former Congress MLA Harminder Singh Jassi for five and a half hours
 lekin iske baad bhi esaiti ke adhikari jassi se kuch nahin ugalva paae
 According to police sources, more than three dozen questions were asked from the former Congress, Harminder Singh Jassi, to which he rounded the answer
 poochtacha ke dauraan zyaadaatar sawaal panchkula hinsa ko lekar kiye gaye the
 Some of the questions that were asked to Jassi were - what do you know about the planning of these riots? When Gurmeet Singh was convicted on 25 August, you were on what? Do you know whom you have been in contact with? Was you in the security of Punjab Police's accused in the security park? Have you helped Honeypreet at the time of absconding? Did the derailment disappear and erased evidence Area you have a role play that? According to sources Jassi told police that he never lived in Panchkula on August 25
 jabaki punjab police ke mutabik 25 agast ko jassi ke saath punjab police ke jawan tainaat the
 The police is now assuming that Jassi Gurmeet was involved in Ram Rahim's convoy but he had gone somewhere along the way
 police sutron ke mutabik buudhvaar ko panchkula main kii gai poochtacha main harminder singh jassi ne jo bhi jawaab die, unki satyata parkhi ja rahi he
 If his statements are beyond truth, summons will be sent to him for further questioning
 police ko shaq he ki harminder singh jassi ne 25 agast ke din apni suraksha main tainaat police ke javaanon ko gurmeet ram rahim ke saath bheja tha
 Jassi's security guards were also seen with her during the early days of Honeypreet's absconding
 aarope to yah bhi he ki jassi ne apni jed plus suraksha kii aad main hi haniprit insa ko deraa se baahar nikaala tha
 Actually, the police also want to find out if Honeypreet had come out with Insa Dera with cash and jewelery, who had supported her
 or aakhir usne wo keemtee chijen kahaan par chhipaai hai
 Harminder Singh Jassi was not only helpful to Honeypreet and the doctor who is still absconding
 udhar, harminder singh jassi ne poochtacha ke baad panchkula ke sector 20 thana se baahar aane par media se koi baat nahin kii
 He went on to say no comment
 ab sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya harminder singh jassi kuch chhipaana chaahate hai
 Because before that he has dismissed the allegations many times
 lekin ab kii baar unke hont sile hue the
 This question is also raising the question whether Harminder Singh Jassi is refraining from talking to the media as directed by the police
 gauratlab he ki gurmeet ram rahim ke jail chale jane ke baddera prabandhnamen jassi kaa khaasaa dakhal dekha gaya he
 He is often seen on the Dera campus along with Gurmeet Ram Rahim's son Jasmeet Insa and his daughter
 sutara to yahaan tak kehete hai ki jassi chaahate hai ki deraa kii kaman jasmit insa ke haath main ho

 tikamgarh
 After the announcement of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, the work of partition of Tikamgarh district of Madhya Pradesh has started officially
 sarkaar niwadi tehsil ko nayaa jila banane ja rahi he or rajasav vibhaag ne iske liye daawey-aapattiyaan bhi maangani shuru kar di hai
 But, opposition has also intensified with this division
 sabase zyada virodh pramukh tirthasthal ramraaja sarkaar kii riyasat orchha ko lekar he
 It is considered as a sign of faith and renunciation of the Tikamgarh dynasty, so people here have started an agitation for not separating Orchha from Tikamgarh
 khud bijepi ke paanch main se chaar vidhayak bhi orchha or mohangarh tehsil ko tikamgarh kaa hissaa bane rahane kii baat par hairaan hai
 In fact, when CM Shivraj Singh came to Niwari recently, he had announced to make Niwari a separate district at the behest of the MLA Anil Jain
 iske baad se hi do jilon ke batwaare ko lekar siyasat tej hone lagi
 Recently the administration started the process of making Niwari a separate district
 iske tahat niwadi jile main niwadi ke saath orchha, mohangarh or prithvipur tehsil ko shaamil karne kii taiyaari shuru ho gai
 The Department of Revenue is seeking claims objections to this
 to vahiin logon ne is faisle kaa virodh shuru kar diya he
 Pushpinder Singh, who opposes the formation of the Orchha Bachao Samiti for the Khilafat of this partition, says that it is a division of hearts, not of districts
 ramraj kii baat karne vaale siem shivaraj singh chouhan ramraaja sarkaar ke raaj kii simaaon ko gata rahe hai
 The area of tikamgarh will be reduced to half from only 5055 square kilometers
 ye aasthaa par chot he
 Tikamgarh journalist Ranjit Singh Parihar says, Tikamgarh will be separated from the Orchha state, it is surprising
 solahavin sadi ke itihaas ko mitaaneki siyasat he
 The division that is taking place is also not true on a physical level, as the Mohangarh tehsil, which is located a short distance from Tikamgarh district, will also join Niwari district
 yahaan ke logon ke liye jile kaa safar 14 kilometre se batchqar 80 kilometre kaa ho jayega
 What is the history of Orchha - it is the sixteenth century
 yahaan ke raja madhukar shah kii patni ganesh kuker jab ayodhya se bhagwaan ram kii murti laayi thim
 There was little work left in the temple, so they kept the idol in their palace
 mandir banane ke baad jab murti ko vahaan se uthaaya gaya to vah uthi hi nahin
 After this, the palace was considered as the temple of Ramraja Sarkar and Raja Madhukar Shah Orchha's kingdom handed him over to Tikamgarh
 tabhi se tikamgarh or orchha kaa aitihaasik judaav ho gaya
 It is given here: Salute to both the guards: Ramaraja Sarkar is recognized all over the world
 yahaan deshi or videshi paryatakon kaa mela laga rahata he
 There is more religious belief here than the natural beauty here
 kyonki, duniyabar main orchha hi ek maatr aisi jagah he jahaan bhagwaan ram ko jeevant raja mana gaya he
 Here daily the policemen of the government give salute both times before Aarti
 saath hi orchha pahunchane par kisi bhi shaasha or prashaasak ko salaami nahin di jaati he
 *** dilli vidhansabha chunaav main mili safalataa ko aam aadmi party loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bhunaanaa chaah rahi he, lekin beete kuch dinon se party main sab kuch thik nahin he
 The displeasure of the activists is well known on many other issues with the return of tickets by the candidates
 vahiin, naaraaz chal rahe logon kii suchi main ab rajasthan ke ummidavaaron kaa naam bhi jud gaya he
 It is reported that many big leaders of the party in the state are disappointed with Arvind Kejriwal and other leaders
 rajasthan main 'aap' ne sabhi 25 loksabhaa siton ke liye ummidavaar utaare hai, lekin inamen se teen ab tak maidan chhod chuke hai, vahiin jo baaki bache hai wo bhi party ke bade netaaon ke rukh se niraash hai
 State leaders say that no big leader has come to Rajasthan to campaign in support of him, including Arvind Kejriwal
 jaipur se party ke loksabhaa ummidavaar dow
 Virendra Singh is in the fray on 'AAP' ticket after taking VRS from the post of the officer of the largest Sawai Man Singh Hospital in the state
 lekin party ke bade neton kaa samarthan nahin milane se niraash hai
 The campaigning of Virendra, who is campaigning with the support of 'AAP' workers in the harsh sun, is not gaining momentum due to the absence of big leaders
 virendra singh kehete hai, 'agar kejariwal nahin aae to sichuation thodi mushkil hogi
 Everyone here wants a glimpse of Arvind Kejriwal
 wo krantikari hai
 Inspired by his revolution, we left the job
 kejariwal aaenge to is seat ko ham acchhee marjin se jeetenge
 'it is worth mentioning that out of 25 Lok Sabha constituencies of Jalore, baran-jhalawar and Ajmer, AAP candidates have left the field so far
 baaraa-jhavawad main party ummidavaar ne yah kehete hue chunaav ladane se manaa kar diya ki tikat milane main der hui, jabaki ajmer ke pratyaashee ne aakhri samay main naam waapas le liya
 The bjp's electoral defeats in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh finally turned the party workers' wait of two-and-a-half years into Uttarakhand into an opportunity
 yah intjaar tha khaali pade vibhinn nigamon, parishadon or board ke padaadhikariyon kii niyukti
 After the bjp's defeat in these three states, Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat became conscious for 2019
 unhen kaaryakartaaon kii naaraazgi ko dur karne kaa khyaal sabase pehle aayaa
 Just 11 days after the assembly election results, on December 22, Rawat distributed responsibilities to 14 prominent workers
 mukhyamantri yah maanakar chal rahe the ki apane is kadam se ve yah sanket dene main safal honge ki ve kaaryakartaaon ke hiton or apekshaaon ko lekar gambhir hai, lekin yah daanv unhen ulataa padane laga
 As soon as the list came out, the Chief Minister started accusing that he had given posts only to his close ones
 bavaal isliye adhik machaa kyonki isamen kisi bhi vidhayak kaa naam nahin he
 When the mlas who were waiting for their chair could not find a place in the list, they started increasing the pressure to fill the vacant two posts of ministers in the state government immediately
 mukhyamantri ke liye is par faisla karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Experts believe that if the Chief Minister will now fill one or two vacant positions, then the caste and regional equations can become his biggest challenge
 darasal, ab tak sarkaar main mukhyamantri or vidhansabha adhyaksh ke alaava chaar mantri gadhwal se hai
 Only four ministerial posts have come from Kumaon
 donon hi mandalon main kai varisht vidhayak mantri kii qatari main hai, jinhen kad ke mutabik tavajjo nahin mili he
 Be it five-time MLA and former state president Bishan Singh Chufal or eighth-time MLA Harvansh Kapoor or four-time MLA Munna Singh Chauhan, former cabinet minister Banshidhar Bhagat or former minister Balwant Singh Bhauryal, all of them are trying hard to get ministerial posts
 Have been
 bhaajapa ke andruni sutara bataate hai ki kuch vidhayakon ko daayitv dene par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The agitators have been opposing this list due to the non-inclusion of the responsibility of the Agitator Samman Parishad for the honor of the agitators
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad ravat ne apane najdiki ke
 s
 panvar ko audyogic salaahkaar or naveen baluni ko swasthya salaahkaar banaaya jabaki donon bhaajapa main adhik sakriy nahin maane jate the
 Apart from this, IT consultant Narendra Singh was also the Chief Minister's choice
 mukhyamantri ne party netaaon ke virodh ke baavjood bal sangrakshan ayog ke adhyaksh pad par bhi ushaa negi ko baitha diya tha
 Now in the first batch of 14 people who have been given the posts, there is also displeasure with no name among the agitators
 manonith kiye daayitvadhariyon main ek naam muslim netaa samim alam kaa he jabaki ek pravasi uttarakhandee dipti ravat bhi is suchi main shaamil kii gai hai
 The names of two former mlas are included in this list
 is suchi par nigaah daalane se spasht he ki sarkaar kii koshish aise kaaryakartaaon ko tusht karnaa he jinako tikat nahin diya ja sakaa or jinka upyog aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main kiya janaa ahm he
 The announcement of the presidents of Garhwal and Kumaon Mandal Development Corporations in this list has also been a cause of controversy
 ek taraf sarkaar donon nigamon ke ekikaran kaa elaan kar chuki he to duusari taraf inke alag alag adhyaksh banane se bhi sawaal uthne lage hai
 In this nomination, according to the caste balance, five from the Thakur society and three from the Brahmin society have been made responsible
 do alpsankhyak to do hi daliton ko kursi di gai he
 Thakurs include Gajraj Bisht, Gyan Singh Negi, Mahavir Rangad, Deepti Rawat and Shamsher Singh Satyal while Brahmins include Vijay Badtwal, Mohan Prasad Thapliyal, and Kedar Joshi
 kedaar joshi or dipti ravat donon hi mumbai or dilli ke pravasi uttarakhandee hai
 Thus migrants have also received representation
 lekin maamle kaa pech yah he ki pad or daayitv dene kii is kala main shaayad maharath dikhaane main ravat thodaa chook gaye hai
 For this reason, there is dissatisfaction among the workers who failed to get the post
 satta ke kek main jinhen hissaa mila he, unka to thik he par asantusht tabaka bhaajapa kii loksabhaa kii taiyaariyon main palitha laga saktaa he
 *** UPPCS kii praarambhik pariksha kaa parchaa li hone ke baad is pariksha ko radd kar diya gaya he

 The petitioners are urged to keep the peace and not take the law into their own hands

 The day will be 23 June 2013
 ilaaka, jammu kashmir kii seemaa se judaa punjab kaa pathankot jile kaa madhopur kasbaa
 bjp's campaign committee chief and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi will be seen on the stage
 unke saath honge punjab ke mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal
 This will be the first rally of the NDA after Modi was handed over the command
 isamen narendra modi bijepi kii badali hui aakraamak kattar ranneeti kii pehali jhalak dikhaaenge
 Since 1996, the party has sidelined those core issues
 jinaki badaulat vah uttar bhartiya rajyon main ek takat bani thi
 Due to which urban voters started supporting him by going beyond caste
 ye mudde the ram mandir, samaan naagarik samhita yani dhara 370 ko khatm karnaa or kashmir main rajya ke virodh ko khatm karnaa
 But then the party understood that due to these issues, the 'secular' parties who took the boat from the socialist ship would not be able to come with it
 satta kii khatir kuch samjhaute hue or kunba badhane laga
 The rising soared to 23 and the core issues went sideways
 magar phir jab jowar utraa or khaataa khaali hone kii kagaar par dikhaa, to bijepi ko samaj main aa gaya ki rashtriya suraksha ke saath in puraane muddon ko jodne kaa phir vakt aa gaya he
 When Narendra Modi addresses this rally on the border of Kashmir, the objective will be to convey this new message not only to the people present there, but to that staunch middle class of the country
 isamen bataaya jayega ki kashmir kaa mudda centre sarkaar ke lachar ravaiye se atka hua he
 Pandit Nehru is the man who produced it and his descendants are not allowing it to be solved till date
 isamen ghati ke aatankwaad se lekar yahaan tainaat sena kii mushkilon par baat kii jaaegi
 It will be reminded how youths belonging to a particular sect of the valley have been caught in major terrorist attacks
 ye wo sur or tevar hai, jinhen ram mandir andolan ke baad bijepi har jagah doharaati thi
 No matter how many political pundits turn the neck, it is also true that in the cities, the BJP has made a place due to these harsh fanatics
 logon ko laga ki muslim tushtikaran ke naam par sarkarein suraksha vyavastha ko lekar sakhti nahin dikhaa rahi hai
 Talking about today's situation, the issue of Ram temple was to woo the public
 zyaadaatar ko samaj aa gaya he ki apane ram durust rahen tabhi sab thik hoga
 In such a situation, the middle class wants only two things
 ek, umdaa aarthik maahaul, taaki use naukari mili
 Get progress and the basic infrastructure of the country should be improved
 sadaken shandaar hon
 There is no shortage of electricity
 duusari jaruri cheez he, suraksha kaa ehsaas
 Whenever there are terrorist attacks, this middle class starts to swear
 use lagata he ki sarkaar kaa dhilaa ravaiya hi in sabake liye jimmedaar he
 In these circumstances, Narendra Modi is coming from BJP
 aarthik morche par unke paas gujarat gaatha he
 He will tell people how Gujarat is progressing
 vahaan sadaken kisi hai
 How much electricity comes, how rich the farmers are
 duusari taraf aegi kanoon kii baat
 The unspoken truth is that neither has there been any violence in their state in the last 11 years after the Gujarat riots
 na hi aatankwaadi ghatana
 Intellectuals point fingers at Modi's methods, but the urban middle class repeats this without arguing that Modi has the ability to fight terrorism strictly
 gujarat ke is netaa ko is baat kaa ehsaas he
 That is why after every meeting with the central government he thunders on Naxalism and terrorism
 centre sarkaar kii niti ke str par naakaamiyon kaa aalaap karte hai
 Modi knows that with the help of these two wheels, security and development, his car can reach the lion gate of power
 bijepi ke netritv vaala endie ab chota parivaar ho gaya he
 If you believe a fresh joke going on at the party headquarters Ashok Road, then there is a small family and a happy family

 Shiv Sena and Akali Dal (badal)
 donon apane kattarpanthi mizaaj ke liye mashhoor hai
 He has no problem in religion politics
 unka ye ravaiya bijepi ko kabhi bhi nahin akhra
 Because of which he had to wear a cap to be secular, he did not live together
 to yah tay he ki ab bijepi ab usee rang dhang main najar aegi, jaise vah adwani ke ubhaar vaale yug main dikhti thi
 The only difference would be that Advani was a maharathi and Modi was a coachman, but now Advani will be in the background and Modi will be a maharathi
 desh kii pratishthit jawahar laal uniwarsity apana aglaa chaatr sangh adhyaksh chunane ke liye taiyaar he
 In order to do this, a presidential debate was organized on campus in which the candidates of different student units put their issues among the students loudly
 jeenyu chaatr sangh kaa chunaav shuukravaar ko hona he
 During the presidential debate, apart from campus issues, there were also issues like removal of section 370 and mob lynching through which candidates targeted their opponents
 sangh or bijepi se sambandhit chaatr ikai akhil bharatyi vidhyaarthee parishad kii ore se adhyaksh pad ke ummidavaar manish jangid ne 'bharat mata kii jai' or 'vande maataram' ke naaron ke saath apana sambodhan shuru kiya
 Taking a dig at his opponents, he said that after the removal of Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir, while we were celebrating on one hand, people of leftist ideology were abusing the army
 unhone jeenyu par rashtradroh kaa dhabba lagane ke liye 'tukade-tukade gang' ko jimmedaar tehraaya

 taaja maamla in sanghathanon ke dabadabe kaa he, jis vajah se gujarat main muslim parivaar ghar bechney ko majaboor ho gaya
 The case is from Bhavnagar in Gujarat, where a Muslim businessman who bought a house about a year ago had to sell his bungalow due to pressure
 bataaya jaataa he ki VHP va RSS ke dabaav ke chalate use yah faisla karnaa padaa
 The English newspaper 'indian Express' has published a report about this
 VHP netaa ne phir uthaai aawaaj, zyada bachche paidaa karen hindooscrap dealer ali asagar javeri ne bhavnagar ke main 10 janvari, 2014 ko bangala liya tha
 The area is predominantly Hindu
 bangala kharidne ke kuch dinon baad hi aasapaas ke hindu padosi unke virodh main utar gaye the
 According to the information, VHP leader Pravin Togadia appealed to the people not to allow the Muslim family to enter the house
 ilaake main virodh pradarshan or muslim parivaar ke khilaaf aapattijanak bayaan dene kii vajah praveen togadiya par exiaar bhi darj hui thi
 Finally, on December 30, 2014, the Bohra Muslim businessman was forced to sell his bungalow to real estate company Bhumati Associates
 VHP ne kaha, 'ghar vaapasi main kuch bhi galat nahin'khaas baat yah he ki jab unhone apana bangala bechaa, to unheen hinduvadi sanghathanon ke sadasyon ne deal main bichauliye kii bhoomika nibhaai, jo ilaake main unka virodh karte the
 Significantly, now only a few in-house houses in the area are named after Muslims

 Violence among people, infectious diseases and climate change played a big role in ending the Indus Valley or Harappan civilization about 4 thousand years ago
 yah daawa ek nae adhyayan main kiya gaya he
 Dr
 Associate Professor of Anthropology at Applechian State University, North Carolina
 gwen robins shug ne ek bayaan main kaha ki jalwaayu, aarthik or saamaajik parivartanon, sabhi ne shaharikaran or sabhyataa ke khatme kii prakriya main bhoomika nibhaai, lekin is bare main bahut kam hi jaankaree he ki in badlaavon ne maanav aabaadi ko kis tarah prabhavit kiya
 Shug, the lead author of the paper, said, "the end of the Indus Valley Civilization and the reorganization of the human population has long been controversial
" yah shodh-patr plos van patrika main prakashit hua he
 The university said in a press release that Shug and an international team of researchers investigated evidence of trauma and infectious disease in human skeletal remains from three Harappan cemeteries
 hadappa sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke sabase bade shaharon main se ek tha
 The statement issued to the press stated that their analysis contradicts the long-standing claims that the Indus civilization developed into a peaceful, cooperative and egalitarian society, where there was no social discrimination, classification and access to basic resources
 There was no bias in me
 vishleshan ke anusaar, hadappa main kuch samudaayon ko anya ke mukaable jalwaayu parivartan or saamaajik aarthik kshati kaa adhik asar jhelana padaa, khaskar saamaajik rup se suvidhahin yaa haashie par rahe logon ko, joki hinsa or bimariyon ke adhik shikaar banate hai
 Sug said that earlier studies suggested ecological factors led to the collapse, but there was no related evidence to substantiate those theories
 pichley kuch saalon main is kshetra main maujuuda takneekon main sudhaar aayaa he
 He said, climate change events have a huge impact on human communities
 vaigyanik ye anumaan nahin laga sakate ki jalwaayu parivartan kaa asar hameshaa hinsa or beemaari jaisaa hoga
 However, in this case, Shug said, the rapid urbanization process in the Indus cities, and the widespread cultural interaction posed new challenges for the human population
 kusht or tapedic jaise sankramak rog sambhavat: ek sampark kshetra main sancharit ho gaye, jo madhya evam dakshin asia tak fail gaye
 The study of Shug suggests that leprosy occurred in Harappa during the urban phase of the Indus civilization, and it spread over time
 tapedic jaisi nai bimaariyaan bhi hadappa sabhyataa ke ant main tathaa nagarikaran ke charan ke baad saamne ain
 He said scars like a skull injury at the time point towards violence and this fact is quite important
 shug ne kaha ki pragaitihaasik dakshin asian sthalon par aam taur par hinsa ke saboot kaaphi durlabh hai
 Shug said the results of the study were quite shocking, because at that time the human population was abandoning cities due to high rates of violence and disease
 haalanki, ek or rochak parinaam yah he ki shahar ke aupchaarik kabristaanon se nikaale gaye logon main shavon ke pareekshan main hinsa or beemaari kii sarvaadhik dar pai gai thi
 Men, women and children were buried in a small pit in a small cemetery in the southeast of the city
 is sample main hinsa kii dar 50 pratishat thi or in logon main 20 pratishat se adhik main kusht sankraman ke sakshya paae gaye
 Shug said that the results of the Indus civilization are also applicable to modern society
 anusandhankartaaon ne likhaa, 'dakshin asia sahit vishwa ke ardhashushk kshetron main maanav aabaadi ko vartmaan main vaishvik jalwaayu parivartan se visham prabhaavon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he

 According to the report, these smartphones will come in three variants with different markets and price tags
 iske saath hi lumia smartfones ko company aadhikarik rup se band bhi kar sakati he
 According to reports, Microsoft is preparing to extend the launch date of Redstone 2 game
 mana ja rahaa he ki company aisa isliye kar rahi he kyonki 2017 ke shuruyaat main surphace smartphone laana he
 Microsoft's CMO has confirmed in a program that the company is working on a 'breakthrough' smartphone that will be built on the lines of Microsoft's tablet surface, not Lumia
 gauratlab he ki microsoft apane pehlesthindots Phone 7ke launch se hi smartphone ke bazaar main mushkil main he
 There are many reasons behind this that push the company's smartphone back

 Was there any film offer before 'singh Sahab the Great'? When i was in Delhi and was 17 years old, i got the first film offer from Habib Faisal's film 'ishqzaade'

 This noise was still seen in bjp's election rallies
 lekin ab 3 rajyon ke agsit pole main bhi yahi shor sunai de rahaa he
 In the exit poll results of Uttar Pradesh, Modi is seen increasing the seats by up to 800 per cent in many areas and the head of the bjp's crowned coronation in up's power is also seen
 fakiri andaaz main desh kii satta sanbhaalane vaale pradhanmantri modi kaa shaayad yahi sabase badi takat he, jisane puure desh main modi naam kaa jaadu thik usee tarah barkaraar rakhaa he jaisaa 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main dikhaa tha
 At that time, Namo Magic formed a government with a strong majority after 30 years in power in the country
 Today, this chanting of namo-namo is also seen in those electoral states, where according to the exit poll, BJP is seeing tremendous success
 apane jaadu ke dam par loksabhaa main upi se bijepi ke 71 saansad laane vaale modi kaa jaadu vidhansabha main bhi sir chadhakar bolaa, kam se kam agsit pole ke nattejey to yahi bataate hai
 In the India Today Axis My India exit poll, the BJP is projected to get 251 to 279 seats, despite an alliance with the Congress, the SP is seen shrinking from 88 to 112 seats, while the BSP is getting signs of getting only 28 to 42 seats
 Huh
 agsit pole ke ye nattejey upi main chal rahi modi lahar kii hi tasviir bayaan karte hai, kyonki upi chunaav main har party kaa apana cheharaa tha, apana maharathi tha
 But the only face of the BJP was Prime Minister Modi
 bijepi ke iklaute maharathi the pradhanmantri modi
 The impeccable image of PM Modi is also the reason for PM Modi's magic to remain intact
 vajah he unka bedaag jivan
 Therefore, when he speaks against corruption and Gundaraj, the public trusts him completely
 ye puri ladaai modi banaam vipaksh kii thi or agsit pole ke nattejey ye sabit karte hai ki upi kii jang main piem modi ne akele hi sabhi vipakshiyon ko dher kar diya
 Only the last phase of UP gave a full view of Modi's strength to the opposition
 aakhri charan kii voting se pehle modi magicdansal modi kaa jaadu logon par kis kadar sir chadhakar bol rahaa he, isaki baangi upi ke marathon chunaav prachaar ke sirf ek charan se hi mil jaati he
 On March 8, there were voting for the seventh and last phase of 40 seats in UP
 iske liye piem modi ne 3 din tak varanasi main deraa daalaa or dekhie tasviir agsit pole in 40 siton par kya anumaan de rahaa he
 In 2012, BJP had only 4 seats in the last phase of 40 seats
 lekin is baar ke agsit pole main bijepi ko 34 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 The Samajwadi Party, despite being in power, appeared in front of PM Modi
 agsit pole ke anumaan main espi-congress gathbandhan 23 siton se ghatakar mahaz 1 seat par simatata dikh rahaa he
 This is just 3 days of Modi, who changed the BJP in 40 seats
 siton main ek jatke main kareeb 800 fisadi kaa izapha kar diya
 Not only this, in the exit poll, the Modi wave has declared the BJP the biggest victory in history in UP
 1991 se abtak upi main bijepi ko kabhi itani seat nahin milin, jitani saal 2017 ke agsit pole main di ja rahi hai
 bjp's old performance in UP elections1991- 221 seats1993- 177 seats1996- 174 seats2002- 88 seats2007- 51 seats2012- 47 Sitamodi's magic with which the people of Uttar Pradesh are now desperate to connect directly

 That is why they have already paid thanks to this thing in their own way

 Those who uphold this wave, met the promises of PM Modi
 a post shared by t r i n a (@mydarlingmyla) on Oct 5, 2018 at 10:35am PDT In recent days, the BJP has questioned the silence of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over allegations of acquiring benami property against Tejashwi and Tej Pratap, both sons of Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav
 bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi nepucha he ki aakhir kaale dhan or benami sampatti ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii maang karne vaale nitish kumaar avaidh sampatti kaa ambara khadaa karne vaale lalu ke donon beton ke khilaaf karrwai karne kii himmat kyon nahin dikhaa paa rahe hai?modi ne nitish se sawaal poocha ki aakhir bhrashtachar ke khilaaf apni jiro tolerance kii niti ke saath vah samjhauta kyon kar rahe hai? modi kii maane to sarkaar girane or kursi jane ke dar se nitish khud lalu ke beton par karrwai karne se batch rahe hai or chaahate hai ki centre sarkaar unke khilaaf karrwai kare jisase saanp bhi mar jaae or lathi bhi na toote
 Sushil Modi asked Nitish that the 750 crore luxurious mall in Patna of Lalu and his family is being built by flouting environmental regulations
 phir bhi nitish kumaar unke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kar rahe hai
 Modi further raised the question that Lalu has taken over half a dozen plots keeping the MLA co-operative rules under control, but even then Nitish Kumar is not taking any action
 mitti ghotaale kaa zikr karte hue modi ne kaha ki bina kisi vajah ke tejasvi yadav ke mal kii mitti ko patna ke chidyaghar main khapaaya gaya or iske jariye lakhon kii aay arjeet kii gai
 Modi asked the question why despite the entire case being exposed, why did Nitish Kumar not take any action against Tejashwi and Tej Pratap? Modi further said that Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav had 45 disbursements of crores purchased in his name in Aurangabad
 Hid the ground in the manifesto
 magar mukhyamantri ab tak koi karrwai nahin kar paae hai
 Significantly, Sushil Modi has been making corruption charges against Lalu and his two sons for the last 2 months and presenting documents along with evidence of assets worth thousands of crores held by him

 In 1994, the Congress government at the Center elected Vajpayee to represent the Indian Human Rights Delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission

 Neither on the basis of birth, neither on the basis of caste nor on the basis of sect
 saahas bhari shakhsiental bihari vaajapeyi saahas bharaa kadam uthaane se gurej nahin karte the
 Pokhran nuclear test in 1998 is a reflection of his thinking

 vidhansabha ke sabhi kamare gulzaar the
 Tea, water was also arranged for the guests and the guests who wished to drink water were resorting to water bottles
 vaise to dilli kii siyasat ko barkhaast purv jalmantri kapil mishra ne garam kar rakhaa he
 They have kept all the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party from the Chief Minister in the dock by accusing them of bribery
 udhar party ke netaaon ne kapil mishra par aarope lagaaya tha ki jalmantri rahete hue jal prabandhan ko sahi rup se anjaam nahi de paane ke vajah se unhen mantri pad se hataaya gaya he
 The comments aapako yaad hoga ki jab kapil mishra ko mantri pad se hataaya gaya tha to upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne kaha tha ki emsidi me haar kii ek vajah pani bhi tha
 That is, Kapil Mishra may be accumulating the tanker scam while being the water minister, but he could not fulfill his basic responsibility to solve the water problem
 vah bhi kisi dilli kii slam ilaake kii baat nahin he jahaan aamtaur par sarkaron kii nazar chunaav se pehle nahin jaati
 Probably no one knows that the assembly campus has been bereft of water for the last three days
 puure campus me pani ko lekar haahaakaar machaa hua he
 It is not yet known to those who sit in AC rooms in the assembly
 jab main vidhansabha get se andar daakhil hone kii parmishan me ho rahi deree ke vajah se get par tainaat suraksha adhikariyon kii pareshaani se rubaru hua, to yahaan suraksha adhikari aapas main pichley teen din se pani na aane kaa ronaa ro rahe the
 Security is not bestowed, so you have to be thirsty on your duty
 baharhaal vidhansabha campus main raat siyaasi tapish to nahin mili lekin saare jamaane kaa dard jhelkar samaadhaan karne kaa daawa karne vaali sarkaar kii naak ke neeche pichley teen se pani nahin he jo bada sawaal khadaa karti he ki aakhir ab tak is ore sarkaar kaa dhyaan kyon nahin gaya
 When i asked this question to my program guest and former Transport Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj, he was surprised as to how this happened? But it made a promise to restore the facility by tomorrow

 There is an outcry over water in the entire campus

 When i came to know about the problem of security officers posted at the gate due to the delay in getting permission to enter inside the assembly gate, the security officers here have been crying among themselves for the last three days
 suraksha me kotahi na ho isliye apni duty par pyaase hi jame rahanaa padataa he
 However, the political campus did not get political heat at night, but the government, claiming to have solved the pain of the past, has no water under the nose for the last three, which raises a big question as to why the government has not paid attention to it so far Gone

 According to the Ministry of Home Affairs in this state affected by separatism, the incidents of stone pelting have reduced in 2017 as compared to 2016
 yah aankada isliye mahatvapurn he kicendre sarkaarka daawa tha ki notebandi ke baad kashmir main algaavvaadiyon ke uksaave par hone vaali hinsa main kami ai he
 This reply given by the Ministry of Home Affairs in the Rajya Sabha confirms this
 kendriya grih rajya mantri hansraj ahir dwaara rajyasabha main die jawaab ke anusaar jammu kashmir main 2016 main kareeb 2808 patharbaji kii ghatnaayen hui thim
 At the same time, the impact of demonetisation by November 2017 reduced the incidence of stones by about one third to 1198
 aise main sarkaar kaa daawa he ki aisa notebandi kii vajah se algaavvaad ko milane vaali funding par roak lagane kii vajah se hua
 Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Hansraj Ahir said that while replying to a written question in the Rajya Sabha, it was further stated that a sufficient amount of Central Arm Police Force (capfs) personnel have been deployed in the state to maintain order
 yah jawan jammu kashmir police kii madad kar rahe hai
 At the same time, in response to another question, Ahir said that the actual number of soldiers posted for security reasons cannot be told
 aapako bataa den ki centre sarkaar lagaataar is baat par jor detii rahi he ki notebandi ne kashmir main aatankwaadi or algaavvaad ko badhaava dene vaali funding par chot pahunchaai he
 Earlier in August, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, while replying to a debate in the Lok Sabha on the supplementary demand for grants, said, "from 2008 to 2010 we saw thousands of stone-pelters on the streets
 pichley kuch maheenon main sadakon par 25-50 yaa 100 se zyada patharbaj nahin dekhne ko mila he
 The main reason for this is that the financing of terrorists has decreased
 " jetali ne kaha tha ki, 'aatankwaadiyon ko dhan kii kami notebandi kaa pratyaksh parinaam he
 This is not only happening in Kashmir Valley, it is happening in Chhattisgarh as well
 ' What happened in the country, the world, the metropolis, sports, economic and Bollywood
