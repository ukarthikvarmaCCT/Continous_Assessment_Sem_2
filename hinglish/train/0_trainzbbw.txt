 jharkhand main pichhali baar bijepi ko 81 main se 37 siten milin thimbahumat ke liye bhaajapa ne jhavimo ke 6 vidhayakon ko todaa thaharyana ke chunaav nateezon ne jharkhand main bhaajapa ko 'alert mod' main laa diya he
 In the last assembly election, the BJP, which somehow managed to form a government by breaking 6 mlas of the main opposition Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JHVMO), wants to touch the majority figure this time
 bhaajapa ne rashtriya upaadhyaksh or rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav prabharee om maathur ko is morche par beete agast se hi laga rakhaa he
 In the Lok Sabha elections held in Jharkhand this year, even though the NDA won 12 of the 14 seats, the party is not in any way cheating the assembly elections
 party kaa maananaa he ki haryana kii sabhi 10 loksabhaa siton par sweep karne ke baad bhi jab vidhansabha chunaav main bahumat nahin mil paaya to phir jharkhand ko lekar bhi 'ati aatmavishvaas' kaa shikaar hona thik nahin
 a leader associated with election management in the BJP told IANS, 'BJP is fortunate in the matter that it gives red alert in time for any election result ahead, which will help in removing the strategic lapses ahead
 is
 haryana ke chunaav nattejey dekhakar party 'phulpruf plan' par kaam kar rahi he
 To put it on the ground, a team of such well-known leaders of the organization will be launched, who will understand the mood of Jharkhand
 'darasal, jharkhand ko lekar bhaajapa kii chintaa isliye he, kyonki pichhali baar 81 main se sirf 37 siten milin thim
 Then the BJP had to break 6 mlas of the main opposition party Jhavimo for a majority
 iske baad bahumat ke liye jaruri 41 ke mukaable bhaajapa ke paas 43 vidhayak hue the
 The governor had approved the merger of more than two-thirds of the mlas as they joined the BJP
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki agar 2014 kii tarah phir bhaajapa kii gaadi bahumat se dur khadi ho gai to pichhali baar kii tarah jodtod kii raajnneeti ke liye majaboor hona padegaa, aise main party is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main puri takat jhonkkar bahumat laane kii koshish main he
 Sources reveal that for the first time in Jharkhand, non-tribal Chief Minister Raghubar Das has been asked to keep dissident leaders united at any cost
 chunaav main bhitarghaat har sambhav tarah se roke
 Like Haryana, the party does not want to take any risk in ticket distribution in Jharkhand
 haryana main tikat katane se naaraaz hue kai netaaon ne jis tarah se baagi ke rup main chunaav ladakar jeet darj kii, usase bhaajapa jharkhand main janaadhar vaale netaaon ko naaraaz karne kaa jokhim bilkul mol lenaa nahin chaahati

 Now the same 'mid-day-meal' has become fatal to the poor
 hatya kii javabdehi ko nestnabud karne ke liye sarkari tantra usamen sudhaar kii baat karne laga he
 The poisonous 'mid-day-meal' of Chhapra and Madhubani districts is stating the fact that the curse of the government anchor is swallowing up the poor
 aaj praathmik vidyalayon main padhai ke naam par mid-de-mile he
 Mathematics on the black board, not science questions, is the order to write the menu of food
 'mid-de-mile' ke bahaane praathmik shiksha ko barbaad karne ke peeche chaalaak maansikta he
 In order to avoid rebellion against the ravishing crop of private schools in which the boys of money are studying and preparing their future, it is necessary to feed stipend and khichdi
 aakhir garib janata ko laganaa chahie ki sarkaar unki chintaa main lagi he
 Cunning people know that it is necessary to exclude the poor from the mainstream of the nation, cutting them off from education
 yah sab mid-de-mile ke bahaane kiya ja rahaa he
 Tie, belt, dress and book are being given to the children for free to look poor
 'skool chalo abhiyaan' ke naam par tamaam enjio lakhon kama rahe hai
 It is being said that 4 percent of the total budget is being spent on education
 lekin zyaadaatar praathmik skulon main maatr ek adhyaaapak he jo skool bhawan banavaane, 'mid-de-mile' kaa hisaab-kitaab lagane main vyast he
 Apart from these, there are also works like census, pulse polio, elections
 sachai yah he ki apane desh main garibon ko shiksha nahin di ja rahi, unhen katoraa lekar aane or 'mid-de-mile' khaane kaa jhunjhuna pakadaaya gaya he
 They do not need to study beyond Kakhara
 wajipha len, khaanaa khaaen, bina adhyaaapak ke padhein, uteern hon or naregaa majdoor bane
 By the eighties-nineties, all the boys studying in rural schools became the axis of governance
 isi se baukhala kar shiksha dene kii aisi niti apanaai gai ki maamla palat jaae
 Why do the pro-poor governments not attack the dual education policy? Why are equal citizens not entitled to equal education? The trick is to separate the poor from the competitive examinations by depriving them of qualitative education
 desh ke 15
 67 percent of primary schools do not have one or even one teacher
 yah vichaar kaa vishay he, jab skulon main adhyaaapak hi nahin honge to kya khichdi khilaane se bachche padhenge?kuposhit bacchon ke maa-baap ko sidhe rashan pahunchaa kar unki bhukh mitaai ja sakati he or jahrile 'mid-de-mile' or chuaachhut kii kuntha se bacchon ko bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Urban mothers go to know their child's progress on parent's day, while village mothers are told to "come in turn, check, test and feed
" '' yani garibon ko padhgaye kaa nahin, sirf khaane kaa haq diya ja rahaa he
 Overall, there is a vicious cycle of 'mid-day-meal' to prevent the children of the poor from growing up by making them educationally disabled

 Interestingly, Rohit was part of the Deccan Chargers' title win in 2009 and this will be the second IPL final for the Mumbai captain
 unhen sirf ek hi samasya bich main kam ran banane kii pravriti ko dur karnaa hoga
 It has not been a good month for Rohit as a batsman, he made his final half-century (79 not out) against Kings XI Punjab on 29 April
 chennai kii team main 'orange capadhari' maaikel hasi shaamil hai, jinhone 732 ran banaae hai

 Chennai have reached the finals four times in a row and five times in total, but this will be the best chance for Mumbai to win the title and avenge the loss in the 2010 final
 mumbai kii team apane senior ballebaaj sachin tendulkar ko yah trophy bhent swaroop dena chaahegi
 In 2010, he was the captain of Mumbai Indians and the team lost to Dhoni's team by 22 runs in the final, which made him very sad
 yah chennai superkingus kaa pehla ipel khitaab tha, iske baad se dhoni kii team kaa darja bada hi hota chalaa gaya
 On paper, this duel will be on par, as both Chennai and Mumbai include Twenty20 offensive specialists Michael Hussey, Dwayne Smith, Ravindra Jadeja and Kieron Pollard

 Chennai have LB Morkel and Sessions Khoj Mohit Sharma, while the trio of Mitchell Johnson, Lasith Malinga and Pollard for Mumbai are doing well

 Hopefully, he will do well for Mumbai, even if the team has to deal with the worry of Ojha, who had an elbow injury
 tippaniyan Eden Gardens has been a lucky ground for Mumbai, having won five of their six matches, a figure that will definitely boost Rohit Sharma's team morale

 sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main apane bhaashan ke dauraan pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne pakistan ko kadaa sandesh diya
 Describing Jammu and Kashmir as an integral part of India, Manmohan Singh said that the agreement on the integrity of India is not acceptable to us at all
 unhone kaha ki pakistan ke saath samasyon ko bharat baatcheet ke jariye hal karnaa chahta he or kashmir samasya kaa samaadhaan shimla samjhaute ke tahat hi kiya janaa chahie
 The Prime Minister gave a strong message to Pakistan and said that it should stop the 'terrorist machinery' present in it

 Sharif on Friday raised the issue of Kashmir in the UN General Assembly and said that it should be resolved according to the UN Security Council resolutions
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat pakistan ke saath jammu or kashmir sahit tamaam mudde shimla samjhaute ke tahat dwipaksheeya baatcheet ke jariye suljhaana chahta he
 'india considers UN resolutions outdated
 singh ne kaha ki aatankwaad har jagah suraksha or sthayitv ke liye gambhir khatra bana hua he or duniyabar main isaki vajah se bahut si jaane jaati hai
 He said, 'we have seen many forms of this shame of terrorism in the last few days, from Africa to Asia
 ’ singh ne guuruuvaar ko jammu ke nikat hue dohare aatanki hamale, jisamen das log maare gaye the or kenya main ek mal par hue aatanki hamale ke sandarbh main yah baat kahi
 He said, 'government sponsored cross-border terrorism is a cause of particular concern to India, it is also worth noting the fact that the center of terror in our region is located in Pakistan in our immediate neighborhood
 ’jammu-kashmir sahit anya muddon ko dwipaksheeya vaarta ke jariye sulajhane kii ichha jaahir karte hue pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha, ‘haalanki, is sambandh main pragati ke liye, yah jaruri he ki pakistani jameen or uske niyantran vaale kshetron kaa istemaal bharat ke khilaaf aatankwaad ko badhaava dene ke liye na ho
 'he said,' it is equally important that the terrorist machinery being instigated from Pakistan should be shut down
 yah baat spasht rup se samaj lee jaani chahie ki jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or bharat kii ekta or kshetreey akhandta ke saath kabhi koi samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa
 'prime Minister Singh will hold a face-to-face meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Sunday

 The dialogue process between India and Pakistan derailed in January this year, when an Indian soldier was beheaded along the Line of Control

 com Dr
 tulsiram kaa taalluk azamgarh se tha
 He was born on 1 July 1949
 dalit samudaay main paidaa hone ke chalate unka bachapan kathith manyataon or bandhanon se jujhane ke saath hi saamaajik evam aarthik kathinaaiyon main beetaa
 Poverty and lack of life were like shadows in his life, but the economic, social and mental suffering he suffered in early life made him a writer
 unke sahitya main us daur kii mukhar abhivyakti hui he
 Dr
 fond of books since childhood
 tulsiram ko marxvad se bahut sambal or saahas mila
 After coming to Benares he joined some writers and Drs
 bhimrao ambedkar kii rachanaaon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 This led to a fundamental change in his composition
 banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay' se padhai samaapt karne ke baad vah dilli chale aae or jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main adhyaapan karne lage or baad main profesar bhi hue
 Dr
 tulsiram ne apane lekhan main dalit jivan ke kashton, yaatnaaon, upekshaaon, pratadna aadi kii khulkar abhivyakti kii or saamaajik bandhanon par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Mahatma Buddha had a profound influence on his unconscious, an example of which is seen in his autobiographies 'murdahiya' and 'manikarnika'
 geet or kavitaayen dow
 As an integral part of Tulsiram's life, both his 'murdahiya' and 'manikarnika' style of writing shows the flow of these two
 ‘murdahia’ or ‘manikarnika’ do khandon main banty unki aatmakatha anuthi saahitiyik kriti hone ke saath hi poorabi uttar pradesh ke daliton kii jivan sthitiyon tathaa saath or sattar ke dashak main is kshetra main vam andolan kii sargharmiyon ke jeevant khajaana hai
 In this autobiography, Professor Tulsiram has tried to present Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's social self by linking it to his self with the help of his memories
 " 'murdahia' pustak kii bhoomika main unhone likhaa tha- ‘murdahia’ hamaare gaanv dharampur (azamgarh) kii bahuddeshiy karmasthali thi
 All the routes from the shepherds to the harbors passed through there
 itnaa hi nahin, skool ho yaa dukaan, bazaar ho yaa mandir, yahan tak ki mazdooree ke liye kalakatta vaali railgadee pakadana ho, to bhi murdahia se hi guzarana padataa tha
 "murdahiya was like a strategic center for Dalits in the 'geo-politics' of our village
 jivan se lekar maran tak kii sari gatividhiyaan murdahia samet leti thi
 The most interesting fact is that Murdahia did not differentiate between humans and animals
 vah donon kii muktidaata thi
 Especially the dog and jackal with hundreds of vultures battling over the flesh of dead animals turned Murdiah into an art-place
 raat ke samay inhen siyaaron kii ‘huaan-huaan’ vaali aawaaj uski nirjanta ko bhang kar detii thi
 In our Dalit colony, thousands of Dalits were buried in Murdahiya for thousands of sorrows
 yadi unamem se kisi kii bhi aatmakatha likhi jaati, uskaa sheershak ‘murdahia’ hi hota
 "murdahiya was truly the life of our Dalit colony
 jamaana chaahe jo bhi ho, mere jaisaa koi adana jab bhi paidaa hota he, vah apane ird-gird ghoomte lok-jivan kaa hissaa ban hi jaataa he
 This was the reason that folk life always followed me
 parinamswaroop mere ghar se bhaagane ke baad jab ‘murdahia’ kaa pratham khand samaapt ho jaataa he, to gaanv ke har kisi ke mukh se nikle pehle shabd se tukbandi banaakar gaanevaale jogibaba, lakkad dhwani par nritykala bikherti natinia, giddh-premi paggal baba tathaa singha bajaata bankia dom jaise jinda lok paatr hameshaa ke liye gaayab hokar mujhe bada dukh pahunchaate hai
 "here is Dr
 tulsiram kii jayanti par unki aatmakatha 'murdahia' kaa ek anshahmere ghar waalon kii ek aisi bakena bhens thi, jo mujhe dekhte hi baanvaan- baanvaan bolte hue mere paas aa jaati thi or mujhe chaatane lagati thi
 He was very fond of me
 meri ek vicitra aadat thi
 Whenever i used to graze on Murdiah, i would sit on his back like a horseman
 use kisi bhi tarah koi etraj nahin hota
 i used to sit on her back and she used to move around
 isi dauraan ek din gaanv ke hi chikhuri ne bhens ke than main lakdi se khod diya
 The buffalo jumped very fast
 mujhe jaraa bhi pataa nahin chalaa ki main kaise ek jhaadi ke paas jameen par kuch der ke liye behosh pad gaya ?jhaadi se satee ek kabr thi
 When my senses came my senses flew away
 bhuton ke dar se main kaanp gaya
 This news spread in the township
 sabhi kehane lage ki bhaison par bhoot chadhakar ghoomte hai kintu ve dikhaai nahin dete
 People used to say about me that they got angry because of this climb, so pick it up and slam it on the ground
 apane chir parichit andaaj main naggar chachaa mere upar baras pade
 i could not understand that i should treat Chikhuri as a ghost or that those who were buried in Murdahiya? Whatever be the case, after this incident i never sat on a buffalo and annoyed the ghosts of Murdiah
 is durghatana se kisuni bhauji bahut dukhit ho gai thi
 One day i called my house and explained to me that 'hey Babu, i was safe from all the wind
 inkar gussa jaan leuva hola
 'ghost vampires in our region were also called Dalit' hawa-batas'
 isi kisni bhauji ke sasur kaa naam tha ‘jaidi’ jo apane bete se alag rahete the
 Jedi Chacha used to protect the same Bansu Pandey family during World War II during his youth
 vishwayuddh ke dauraan ek din ve hal jot rahe the
 He disappeared from the field
 gaanv vaale kehete the ki angrej dher saare mazdooron kaa apharan karke ladaai ke liye vilaayat le gaye the
 It is not clear how Zaidi disappeared
 He himself does not tell anyone the real thing
 varshon baad jab dwitiya vishwayuddh samaapt ho gaya, to ve gaanv waapas aae the
 The villagers were very happy with his return
 ve the to bilkul anpadh kintu baaten aisi karte the ki lagata tha ki ve antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke professor hon
 Zaidi Chacha used to refer to 'charachelva' in a portrait style and called him brave
 ve anek hathiyaaron ke naam ke bigdel shabd bhi bich-bich main akaaran hi bolne lagate the, jaise-'sabamari' fatter palan, damdam, tank, banethi, bam aadi-aadi
 Some words were also spoken, such as Maspotam, Sutle, Basra, Baghdad, Dubai, Chumma, Tigris etc
 is tarah ke anek shabd ve bina vaakya ke swatantra rup se aise bolte the ki jaise kisi ko daant rahe hon
 We all did not understand at that time what they were saying
 varshon baad jab main banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay main ucch shiksha grast tha, tab samaj sakaa ki jaidi chachaa churchill ko charchelava, sab marin ko sabamari, fiter plane ko fatter palan, damdam bullate ko dam dam, tanks ko tank, banet ko banethi, mesopotamia ko masapotum, shat al arab ko satal, raas al khema ko khammaa aadi-aadi kehete the
 The reality is that the Jedi uncle was taken to Baghdad during World War II as a temporary minister
 baad main jaise-taise ve gaanv waapas aa gaye the
 The reality was that Zaidi Chacha's original name was 'lurkhur'
 kintu baghdad pahunchne par kisi angrez afasar ne unhen shiya musalamaanon ke lokapriy upnaam 'jaidi' ke naam se pukarana shuru kar diya
 This was his nickname there
 kintu lurkhur chachaa apane ko ‘jaidi’ samajhane lage the
 In the village too, people started calling him as 'zaidi'
 ve vishwayuddh kii anek kahaniyaan sunaaya karte the, jise sunakar main bahut mantrmugdh ho jaataa tha
 These stories of him used to haunt me
 inhen sunakar utkar ichha hoti thi ki main bhi paanchavin ke aage padhun or sari duniya ke bare main jaanu
 But the constant dilemma and worry of missing out of studies had made me completely wretched
 is uhapoh ke dauraan ek ajeeb haadasa ho gaya
 Zaidi Chacha had started harboring here again with Bansu Pandey
 uchit bani kii maang ke kaaran ve aksar jhagad padate the
 Due to this nature, Bansu called a Brahmin soldier of Chiraiyakot police station with whom he had friendship, to teach a lesson on the charge of goat theft and beat up Zaidi's uncle and started preparing to take him to the police station
 vicitra tathy yah tha ki bansu ke paas koi bakrii thi hi nahin
 Somehow Zaidi Chacha got rid of the police by paying five rupees
 police se is baar bhi ham sabhi buree tarah se dar gaye the
 Traumatized by this deceitful fraud of Bansu Pandey, Zaidi Chacha started performing a new type of Satyagraha in the form of resistance
 ve sab kaam-dham band kar dadhi-moonch badhanaa shuru kar die tathaa nichand dhoop main charpai daalkar ek chadar odhakar din bhar sote rahete the
 When asked, i would keep growing my beard mustache and sleep in the sun until Baban does justice
 ve is maamle main nihaayat jidadi the
 They refused to accept any other agreement by the Panchayat etc
 dhire-dhire ve biimaar padane lage
 Ultimately, he gave up his life in the same famine
 unki mrityu se bada shokmay vaataavaran ho gaya tha
 Zaidi Chacha was Gurmukh
 ve shiv narayan panth ko maanane vaale the
 Whenever our house seemed to be gadi, Zaidi Chacha Santauva was an expert in singing
 unki badi buland aawaaj thi
 When Santoba was at his peak with dhol-majire, Zaidi Chacha would suddenly stand up and say 'hwaay' in a very loud scolding style
 unke is joardaar 'hvai' se tauba kaa aakarshan behad rochak ban jaataa tha
 On such occasions, i used to wait when Zaidi chanted the uncle as 'hwai'? When his corpse was being taken to Murdahiya for burial, according to the tradition of Shivnarayan Panth, many people during Santauva scolded him
 Wanted to follow the style, but where was the thing that was in Zaidi Chacha
 main bhi unki laash ke peeche-peeche murdahia par gaya tha
 With his burial, another name was added to the ghost population
 unki kabr se lautate hue mere mastishk main unke ye shabd- charachelva, masapotum, fatter, damdam, khammaa, dajala aadi shor machaate rahe
 Today, when i have become a professor and president of a large center of international politics, i take pride in admitting that the real father of my inspiration behind this was the three poor laborers who inadvertently led me towards international politics at a young age
 Was drawn inamen ek the soviet sangh main ‘samohikheti' vaale munnar chachaa, duusare daage ko ‘dungariyaa' kehane vaale soni tathaa tisare the, dadhiyal jaidi chachaa
 The mystery of his beard-mustache was revealed in my mind when i discovered during a research on Iran in 1978-79 that thousands of youths in the 1910s and 20s led by a revolutionary named Mirza Kuchek Khan of Gilan province
 He vowed that he would grow a beard and a mustache and leave the house and live in the forest until he would drive British imperialism away from the soil of Iran
 iran main unke is andolan ko ‘jangal andolan' tathaa krantikariyon ko junglee kaha jaataa he
 Mirza Kuchek also used to correspond with Khan Lenin
 jaahir he, jaidi chachaa ne apane baghdad pravaas ke dauraan in irani jungliyon ke bare main avashya kuch suna hoga, isiilie unhone unka rasta apanaate hue bansu pandey ke viruddh vidroh kaa bigul phoonk diya tha, jiske chalate unhone jaan de di, kintu krantikari adarsh nahin choda
 Such was the hungry revolutionary Baghdad Return 'zaidi' uncle

 unhone kaha tha ki antarrashtriya samudaay yahaan aatankwaad kii buraai se ladane ke liye he lekin khatra kahin or maujuud he or ve karrwai nahin kar rahe
 The Obama administration, however, on Thursday expressed satisfaction over the Pak Army's aggressive actions against militants in tribal areas

 The four have no special option to seek relief from the court, the curative petition is not a legal right, all the gang rape convicts have been sentenced from the lower court to the Supreme Court
 Why are the convicts of Nirbhaya not hanged even after 7 years of the horrific incident
 2018 main hi supreme court ne bhi nirbhaya cese ke chaaron doshiyon kii faansee kii sajaa ko barkaraar rakhte hue unki apil ko bhi khaarij kar diya tha
 After the appeal is dismissed from the Supreme Court, these four have no special option to seek relief from the court
 curative pitishan bhi un durlabh maamalon main lagaai jaati he jisamen aap court ke die jajment main aadharbhoot trutiyaan (fundamental error) dhund paae or jisase yah saaf ho ki court kaa aadesh palata ja saktaa he
 Regarding the punishment, Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi said, "I welcome the Delhi government's suggestion to dismiss the mercy petition of one of the convicts in the Nirbhaya case
" mujhe ummid he ki doshiyon ko jald se jald faansee kii sajaa milegi
 'curative petitionation is not a legal right, however, in the event of the convicts not having a curative petition, they can also be hanged because it is not their legal right to put a curative petition, but it is a legal option
 nirbhaya ke maamle main curative pitishan lagati bhi he to vah turant khaarij ho jaaegi
 That is why curative petition has not been imposed by the culprits to prolong the matter
 iskaa aage kaa rasta maafee kaa hota he yani ki supreme court se faansee milane ke baad agar raashtrapati ke saamne dayaa yachika lagaai jaati he or vah use sweekaar kar lete hai to aksar faansee kii sajaa ko umrakaid main tabdeel kar diya jaataa he
 Raham's expectation is that the President will accept or reject the mercy petition, it is decided by the President using his discretion on the basis of the suggestion from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Law, but his chances in this case are also very low
 Coming because from the lower court to the Supreme Court, no such mercy has been paid to the culprits of the case of Nirbhaya
 It is jis barbarta se nirbhaya kaa gangrape kiya gaya usne puure desh ko hilaa kar rakh diya tha, kahin se bhi raahat milane ke asaar nahin dikh rahe hai
 The question is still the same, why have not these four been hanged so far
 to uskaa kaaran bhi yahi he ki naa to in logon kii taraf se curative pitishan ke kanoonee vikalp ko ab tak istemaal kiya gaya he
 Apart from this, only one of the 4 has filed mercy petition with the President, but it is still pending with the President
 yani raashtrapati ke paas dayaa yachika khaarij hoti he yaa usase pehle supreme court main curative pitishan, to uske baad in chaaron ke faansee par latakaane kaa rasta saaf ho jayega
 After which the sessions court has to issue a death warrant in this case, after getting the warrant, the jail administration executes the preparations to hang it
 faansee main kitna vakt lagegaa?haal hi mennirbhayaake mata-pita ne in chaaron ko jald faansee die jane ko lekar patiala house court main yachika lagaai jis par court ne in chaaron doshiyon ko notice jari karte hue 13 disambar tak yah bataane ko kaha he ki is maamle main wo raashtrapati ke paas dayaa yachika yaa supreme court main curative pitishan lagaana chaahate hai yaa nahin, isko lekar apana paksh court ke saamne rakhen
 That is, the hearing on December 13 in this case will be very important because the answer of these four filed in the court will decide how much more time is left to hang Nirbhaya's convicts
 yani ki is maamle main fast trek court se lekar supreme court ne bhale hi 6 saal ke bheetar apana aadesh suna diya ho, lekin faansee main kitna vakt lagegaa, yah kahana mushkil he

 In fact, we forgot to tell you that he is serving a life sentence for murder

 ab jurm kaa khaataa chunki zaraa bada he lihaaza baaki jurmon ke hisaab-kitaab ke liye akasar jail se nikal kar duusari adaalaton me bhi hajiri lagaani hoti he
 One such appearance took place in Muzaffarpur court on Friday

 But apart from being a Bahubali, as the brother is also a former MLA, so he came to court with full vigor

 The talk did not stop at this
 munna ji ko kuch or bhi kahana tha
 So, amidst the laughter and laughter, inside the court complex, the table was given a punishment and also responded in a threatening manner to the accusation of extortion in his attitude
 ab chunki shukla ji bihar main sattadhari party ke netaa hai lihaaza yo sochna yaa maananaa vakt kii hi barbaadi hogi ki kisi kaatil ko is tarah hero bana kar or hathkadi ke naam par zevar pahana kar ghumaane waalon ke khilaaf kya karrwai hogi?naak bachaane ke liye sarkaar ne bas itnaa jarur kiya ki parche baantne dene ke liye ek sab-inspector or paanch sipaahiyon ko suspend kar diya

 Whether it is related to the presidential election or the Lokpal Bill or the issue of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail sector
 duusari ore, rajya kaa congress netritv trinmul kii aguwai vaali rajya sarkaar par hinsa va anya maamalon main vifal rahane kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa he
 Mamta said, "some Congress leaders of the state sit in the studios of CPI (marxist Communist Party) supported television channels and give lectures criticizing our government as if we were running the government at their mercy

 Significantly, although the Congress and Trinamool have an alliance between the state and the Center, both have been at loggerheads on various issues
 mudde chaahe raashtrapati chunaav se jude hon yaa lokapal vidheyak se yaa khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh (epadiai) kaa mudda ho
 On the other hand, the Congress leadership of the state has been accusing the Trinamool-led state government of failing in violence and other matters
 mamata ne kaha, "rajya ke kuch congress netaa makapa (marxvaadi communist party) samarthit televijan channelon ke studio main baithte hai or hamaari sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue vyaakhyaan dete hai, jaise ham unki dayaa par sarkaar chalaa rahe hon

 <padhe-likhe ladke jo acha kamaate hai, wo bhi aatank kii taraf ja rahe hai is sawaal par dilli police kamishnar bhim singh bassi ne kaha ki bharat ke liye aatank koi nai baat nahin he
 We have been facing it since the 80s, which continues even today
 soshal media se aatankiyon ko badhavaunhone kaha ki indian mujahidin ke rup main bhartiya muslim yuvaaon kaa ek nayaa cheharaa saamne aayaa tha
 The youth of India were misled and involved in terrorist activities
 soshal media ke jariye is tarah kii gatividhiyon ko badhaava mila he
 Nazarbassi, who lives on terrorist activities, said that it is not necessary that anyone who has money will not move towards terror
 aatanki gatividhiyon main shaamil logon par hamaari najar bani rahati hai
 We were also eyeing those who were caught
 jab sir se pani upar nikal gaya, to inako giraftaar kar liya gaya
 Modules carry out attacks based on terror
 kya aaj kii taarikh main dilli or bangaleru jaise shahar surakshit hai? yah ek bada sawaal he
 On this, Ahmed Javed said that the attacks in all the big cities were module based
 vah chaahe mumbai main 26 / 11 kaa hamalaa ho yaa halhi main paris main hua hamalaa
 The Indian police is maligned
 We have suffered the sting of terror when the world did not even understand it
 indian police ko kaaphi badnaam kiya jaataa rahaa he
 It became a fashion
 kaha gaya ki yahaan community friendli police kii jarurat he
 But the truth is that India's police model is community friendly
 dilli vidhansabha main jab se purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi se bharat ratna waapas lene vaale prastaav kaa mudda uthaa tabhi se congress behad aakraamak najar aa rahi he
 Delhi Congress leader Ajay Maken warned the Aam Aadmi Party to withdraw the proposal and apologize in very harsh words
 vahiin, ravivaar ko youth congress ne itio ke aam aadmi party mukhyalay main joardaar pradarshan kiya
 During this period, enthusiastic activists shouted slogans and tore up huge hoardings and banners outside the office
 darasal, congress ke kaaryakartaaon kaa pradarshan aam aadmi party ke khilaaf tha
 During this period, activists shouted slogans against the Aam Aadmi Party and also demanded Kejriwal's resignation
 isse pehle shanivaar ko bhi dilli congress kii ikai ne aam aadmi party ke daftar ke baahar joardaar pradarshan kiya tha
 It was headed by Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken
 'kejariwal maafee maango' muhim chalaa rahi he congressdilli congress ne lagaataar aam aadmi party ke khilaaf muhim ched rakhi he
 From social media to posters in the streets of Delhi, the Congress is demanding the resignation of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the party had also launched a hashtag apologizing Kejriwal on social media
 haalanki, aam aadmi party par dilli congress ke pradarshan kaa koi khaas asar hota nahin dikh rahaa
 The party also does not consider it appropriate to answer on this issue
 tut rahi gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon kii door!dilli main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress or aam aadmi party ke bich gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaen ab or bhi kamjor hoti najar aa rahi he
 The Delhi unit of the Congress was seen against this alliance from the beginning
 ajay maakan ne kai maukon par gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko puri tarah se khaarij kar diya tha
 But there was speculation that the top leadership might agree on an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, but now when the issue of the return of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Bharat Ratna in the Delhi Assembly came up, the Congress eye has been taken from the Aam Aadmi Party
 She kind of got crooked
 aise main aap gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaen bhi behad kam hoti najar aa rahi hai
 While on one hand, Kapil Sharma is not taking the name of the troubles, on the other hand, he is gradually getting the support of the TV industry
 krishna abhishek or shilpa scindia ke baad ab khabar he ki mashhoor tivi kamedian bharti singh bhi kapil ke saport main utari hai
 During an interview, he tied the bridge to praise Kapil
 unhone kaha he ki kapil bahut vinamr hai or wo aacharan se madadgaar bhi hai
 He further said that i know that Kapil is surrounded by controversies regarding the use of abusive language these days but i am sure that Kapil can do everything but can not insult someone or hurt anyone's feelings
 kapil prakaran: juuta maarane vaala bhul gaya, khaane vaale ko ab tak yaad haibtaa den ki asal jindagi main bharti or kapil donon achche dost hai
 She has been seen working in a few episodes of Kapil's show Comedy Nights with Kapil

 On social media, he is being called an abusive and arrogant

 However, he later deleted these tweets

 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about making his parliamentary constituency Kashi Kyoto, then the question came in the minds of those who knew and understood Kashi, why should a city older than history be made like Kyoto with a history of 600 years old
 Wants to Was this announcement done thoughtfully or was it merely a literal rhyme of Kashi and Kyoto? In order to make Kashi Kyoto, more than two hundred buildings were identified from Lalita Ghat in Benares to Vishwanath Temple for expansion of Kashi Vishwanath Temple
 Are gone, which are being broken
 inamen lagbhag 50 kii sankhya main pracheen mandir va math shaamil hai
 These are all temples coming under the Kashi Vishwanath Corridor
 in pracheen mandiron, dev vigrahon kii raksha ke liye andolnarat shankaracharya swami swaroopanand ke shishy swami avimukteshwaranand 12 din ke upwas par baithe hai
 Swami Avimukteshwarananda says that the pucca mahal of Kashi is made up of such architectural legislation which was given by Lord Shiva himself
 aise main kaashi vishwanath coridor ke kaaran pakkaa mahal ke puranic mandiron or dev vigrahon ko nasht karne se kaashi hi nasht ho jaaegi
 The aajtak of Kashiswami Avimukteshwarananda will be destroyed
 in se khaas baatcheet main kahana he ki pakkaa mahal hi kaashi kaa man, mastishk or hriday he
 The pakka mahal is made up of such architectural legislation which was given by Lord Shiva himself
 aise main iske nasht hone se kaashi ke nasht hone kaa khatra he
 It is not just a matter of Pucca Mahal or a resident of Kashi, but a question of faith of 1
25 billion countrymen
 desh ke alag-alag hisson se puraanon / granthon main padhakar log apane aradhy devi-devataaon ke darshan karne kaashi aate hai
 In such a situation, when they come to Kashi, they will surely ask where their Gods and Gods have gone
 is
 kyonki ayodhya main sirf ek mandir kii baat he
 But here there are many temples worshiped by the above tradition of our Puranas
 abhi ham shastron ke anusaar hi virodh kar rahe hai
 But if the government, inspired by politics, expects that it will agree only with public pressure, then we will also call upon the people
 aise main yah sawaal jarur uthegaa ki jo party mandir banane ke naam par satta main ai thi, usne mandiron ko kyon todaa?swami avimukteshwaranand kaa kahana he ki ham sarkaar kii kisi yojana ke virodh main nahin hai
 Governments bring any schemes in public interest only
 hamaara virodh sirf itnaa he ki kisi bhi vigrah or mandiron ko apamaanit naa kiya jaae, apujit naa rakhaa jaae, unke sthaan se unhen na hataaya jaae
 Keeping this safe, we do not mind if the corridor is constructed
 kya he pakkaa mahal kaa mahatv ?pakkaa mahal kii avadharana kaashi ke ganga tat par assi se rajghat tak kii he
 It is said that if you want to understand Kashi, then it is important to understand Pakka Mahal
 yah ilaaka khud main kai samskritiyon ko samete hue he
 There is no such state in the country which is not represented by a firm mahal
 alag-alag rajyon kii riyasaton kii pracheen imaarat va vahaan puuje jane vaale puranic mandir or dev vigrah isi kshetra main sthit hai
 People come from all over the country to visit
 pakkaa mahal main bengali, nepali, gujarati, dakshin bhartiya samudaayon ke apane apane muhalle hai
 There have been many developmental works in Kashi, but the heritage of mythological importance was never destroyed, nor were they pierced
 lekin aaj kaashi kaa yahi pakkaa mahal vikaas kii bhent chadhane ja rahaa he
 The conspiracy to eradicate the legacy of thousands of thousands of years old has been converted into development
 jisase kaashi kaa hriday kahe jane vaala pakkaa mahal in dinon sahamaa sa he

 uttar pradesh ke ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye dharm sabha yojit karne ke baad ab shivasena ne pangarpur kaa rukh kiya he
 The Shiv Sena from Pandharpur, which is recognized as a major religious place in Maharashtra, will circle the state government led by the BJP with its cooperation
 yahaan ek vishaal dharm sabha kaa aayojan kiya gaya he, jise shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare sambodhit karenge
 It has been reported in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' on Monday
 haalanki, mukhpatr main ye bhi daawa kiya gaya he ki pangarpur kii dharm sabha kaa makasad raajnneetik ke zyada dharmik he
 But it has also been said that this Dharma Sabha organized for the people of Maharashtra is for the people of the state and to overthrow the weak government
 saamana main bataaya gaya he ki shivasena pramukh ke bhaashan ke centre main maharashtra kaa vikaas rahegaa
 Also, a target has been set to invite a large number of Shiv Sainiks in this meeting
 party kii taraf se bataaya gaya he ki is dharm sabha main kareeb 3 lakh logon ke jutane kii sambhaavna he
 Please tell that Pandharpur is also called Kashi of South
 dharmik rup se ye shahar kaaphi mahatpurna he
 In such a situation, Shiv Sena, which had raised the issue of construction of Ram temple by gathering in Ayodhya before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, is now trying to strengthen its message through Pandharpur
 centre main narendra modi or bihar main nitish kumaar kii jeet ke peeche sabase bada cheharaa maane jane vaale raajnneetik ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ke idia congress kaaryakartaaon ke gale nahin utar paa rahe hai
 This is the reason why the party has not been able to formulate a concrete strategy for the assembly elections in UP so far
 ek taraf endie sarkaar ke do saal puure hone ke maukey par bijepi ne upi vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye shankhanaad kar diya he to duusari taraf congress kheme main abhi tak chunavi mudde tak tay nahin ho sake hai
 According to the English newspaper Hindustan Times, the Congress has given the task of strategy to Prashant Kishore keeping in mind the UP assembly elections but the party is unable to digest his idea
 prashanth kishor ne rahul gandhi ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar banane or priyanka wadra ko chunavi campan lead karne kaa suzav diya tha
 But these ideas of him were sidelined
 kishor ne party ke rajya pramukh nirmal khatri kii jagah kisi brahman netaa ko party pramukh banane kaa suzav diya tha
 But the Uttar Pradesh general secretary of the Congress, Madhusudan Mistry, opposed the suggestion, saying that now there is very little time left to bring a new face as elections are due in 2017 itself
 duusari taraf kai kaaryakartaaon kii shikaayat he ki prashanth kishor party ke andruni kaaryon main bhi dakhsandaji bad rahi he
 The Congress has already made it clear that Kishore's role will be limited to making suggestions in preparing manifesto for Punjab and Uttar Pradesh elections

 gautam buddha nagarpulisaki ore senoadamein chalaae gaye ek special oparation main 48 ghanton ke dauraan kareeb 17,000 litre se zyada avaidhsharabjabt kii gai or chori-chupe sharaab bechney vaale 60 logon ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 The police officer said that Operation 'yellow Water' was started on the night of 24 September and it continued till the night of 26 September

 buudhvaar ko upie sarkaar antarim rail bajet pesh karne ja rahi he or uski koshish he ki iske madhyam se vah matadaataaon ko rijhaae
 For this, it will not reduce the rates of railway tickets but will announce the start of many new trains
 bataaya jaataa he ki upie sarkaar ke zyaadaatar mantriyon or saansadon ne rail mantri se guzarish kii he ki unke ilaake main nai train di jaae yaa vahaan mahatvapurn trainon ke tehraav ghoshit kiye jaaen
 Looking at the election head, these leaders are putting a lot of pressure on the Railway Ministry
 vaise bhi bharat main nai railgadiyon ko shuru karne ke liye vahaan ke netaaon kaa bada yogadan hota he
 This year too, Railway Minister Mallikarjun Kharge is under tremendous pressure and he is looking for a way to make more and more ministers and mps happy
 khadge umr ke lihaaj se sabase varisht hai or is samay vah ek santulan banane main lage hue hai
 The biggest problem of the Railway Minister is that the expenditure on operating the trains is increasing and its economic condition is not such that the rail fares can be reduced
 aankade bataa rahe hai ki railway kii parichaalan laagat april-disambar avadhi main bajet se 5,000 karod rupee zyada ho chukaa he
 That is, his deficit is increasing
 iske alaava uski kamai 3,000 karod rupye ghat gai he
 Railways are also unable to reach their targets in freight movement
 isliye rail kiraaye ghataane kaa sawaal hi nahin paidaa hota he
 But to make the public happy, he will announce several new trains
 iske alaava railway kii soochna vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye kai bade kadam uthaaenge
 Under this, arrangements will be made to provide accurate information about trains going to and from the stations
 iske alaava kai steshnon par automatic tikat vendig mashine bhi lagaai jaaengi
 Several steps may be announced to provide more facilities to the passengers in the stations
 rail mantri kai trainon ke vistaar or tehraav kii bhi ghoshnaa kar sakate hai
 He has also accepted some demands of mps and other leaders and under it new surveys can be done
 inase bhi un ilaakon main log khush honge
 Apart from this, he can also announce the construction of a rail bridge in many congested areas
 shaharon ke andhadhundh vikaas ke kaaran vahaan rail phatakon par baari bheed hone lagi he jisase kai shaharon main to trephic jam kii bhi samasya ho gai he
 The mps there have put many such demands before the Railway Minister
 inamen se kaiyon ko anumati mil jaaegi
 The result of the populist policies of the railway ministers is that the construction of railway lines in the country is decreasing very much
 bharat main aazaadee ke 63 varshon main jitani lambii rail line baniin, china main sirf paanch varshon main (2006-11) ban gayi
 Due to non-increase of railway fares in time, there has been a loss in the operations of the railways and many schemes of the Railways have been questioned

 People are disillusioned with naming their children as development
 aajkal logon ne nae janme bacchon kaa naam vikaas rakhana kam kar diya he
 Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi started using the word Vikas, since then the word Vikas has become a brand name for BJP

 According to 2016 figures, 34 thousand children have been registered that year
 inamen 16 hajaar bachche purush hai
 If we talk about literal name development, then their rate is very low
 10 se bhi kam bacchon ke naam vikaas rakhe gaye hai
 Joshi said that so far 28 thousand children have been registered in 2017
 inamen 16 hajaar bachche purush hai, inamen se keval 7-8 bacchon ke naam vikaas rakhe gaye hai
 It is clear from these figures that the general public is now distancing themselves from 'development'

 unhone kaha ki puraa gujarat kah rahaa he ki vikaas pagal ho gaya he
 Our Chief Minister says, 'I am Vikas', then these people do not understand
 modi kii jaaduugari gujarat main puri ho gai he
 BJP has had to change its agenda
 ab bolte hai ki ham vikaas par nahin rashtrawaad par ladenge
 It is clear that common people do not want to bring politics into their lives
 vikaas naam rakhane se unako lagata he ki baccha jab bada hoga, to wo sirf ek majaak banakar rahakar jayega

 rishte ko majboot banaae rakhane ke liye kya karnaa chahie ye to sabhi bataate hai lekin kya nahin karnaa chahie ye jaananaa bhi bahut jaruri he
 Many a times it happens that the loving couple do something which causes tension in their relationship, which results in a rift in the relationship
 par agar ye pataa chal jaae ki ye baaten rishte ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati hai to unhen nahin karke rishte ko sambhala ja saktaa he
 Relationship is very easy but it is very difficult to make a happy relationship
 aise main aap chahen to in baton se parhez karke apane rishte ko kaaphi had tak sambhaal sakate hai
 It is very important to know one thing in this regard and that any relationship neither gets spoiled in a day nor can it be fixed in a single day
 ye ek prakriya he, jisamen samay lagata he
 Never do these things for a happy relationship: 1
 apni samasyaon main dusron ko nahin jodnakhushhaal jode apni samasyaon or aapattiyon ko kabhi bhi dusron ke saamne nahin rakhte
 Even if they are family members, they believe in solving their problems sitting face to face

 Do not compare your relationship with anyone else
 For a happy relationship, it is very important that you never compare your relationship with anyone else
 isse sambandh sudharne ke bajaay bigadate hi hai
 Comparing your relationship with another couple expresses your feelings of insecurity
 3
 Avoiding the blame can only be a happy couple
 ladaai har jagah hoti he
 Some people start blaming each other during the fight, doing so can make your relationship weak
 kisi ek ko dosha dene se behatar he ki donon apni-apni galati par vichaar karen or use sulajhane kii koshish karen

 They do not speculate with themselves
 kayaasein lagane se behatar he ki aap saamne baithkar khud hi sachhai puch len aisa karne se aap donon ke bich galatfahami hone kii gunjaaish bahut kam ho jaaegi

 Bhushan, in a letter to the Chairman of the Drafting Committee and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, today objected to Law Minister m Veerappa Moily issuing a comparative statement of the drafts of the two sides and the alleged dissent note to the Hazare side's draft
 moili masauda samiti ke sanyojak the
 The government has been officially approached for the first time through the letter from the Hazare side after the ninth and final meeting of the Joint Drafting Committee on 21 June
 purv vidhi mantri bhushan ne patr main kaha, bataaya ja rahaa he ki moili ne tulanaatmak talika jari kii, jise cabinet or sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko bheja jayega
 
 
 This table (draft Hazare side) does not properly present the Jan Lokpal Bill as it has many flaws and in many places the provisions of our draft have not been fully referenced
 unhone kaha, yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki moili ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa masauda vaastavik he or hazaare paksh kaa masauda ek asahmati vaala note he
 We do not agree with this
 samiti main 10 sadsy the
 Five members supported one draft, while the remaining five members accepted the second draft
 bhushan ne kaha, lihaaja, jahaan tak sanyukt samiti ke nattejey kaa sawaal he to donon masaudon ko samaan samarthan praapt he
 i would request you (mukherjee) to consider the two drafts as the joint result of the Joint Committee
 
 
 
 i think it would be a good decision to consider the two drafts as a joint result of the Joint Drafting Committee
 unhone kaha ki sanyukt samiti kii pichhali baithak main donon pakshon ne faisla kiya tha ki lokapal vidheyak ke donon masaudon ko cabinet or raajnneetik dalon ke samaksh rakhaa jayega
 In a letter to Mukherjee, the former Law Minister said, "however, if you want to combine the two drafts as one table, we can try this, but please do not release it without the consent of all the members
" bhushan ne sarkaar dwaara taiyaar talika ko hazaare paksh ke paas bhejne kii bhi peshkash rakhi taaki usamen sudhaar kar use sarkaar ko lautaaya ja sake
 While the government has convened an all-party meeting on the issue of Lokpal on July 3, the Hazare side has also started an exercise to communicate with political parties

 After this, Ashok Gehlot said, similarly boys and girls are killed in honor killing
 iske liye unhone sirohi kii ek ghatana kaa zikr kiya, jisamen ek ladke or ek ladki ko jinda jala diya gaya tha
 The media could not even come to know about this incident

 seemaa suraksha bal (biguef) ke barkhaast sipaahi tej bahadur yadav ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf varanasi se chunaav ladane ke mansoobon par pani phir gaya he
 Tej Bahadur's nomination was canceled on Wednesday
 nirvachan adhikari kii ore se jari kiye gaye notice kaa jawaab dene tej bahadur yadav buudhvaar ko apane vakil ke saath nirvachan adhikari se milane pahunche the
 After which the Returning Officer rejected Tej Bahadur's nomination letter
 tej bahadur yadav ne pehle nirdaleey phir samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke chunaav chinh par namakan kiya tha
 In one nomination paper, he had said that he was dismissed from the army due to corruption but in the second nomination he did not give information about it
 mangalvaar ko parchon kii jaanch ke baad jila nirvachan karyaalay ne tejbahadur ko notice jari karte hue ek may tak jawaab dene kaa samay diya tha
 At the same time, under the new equation, Shalini Yadav can compete with Prime Minister Modi in the electoral arena on behalf of SP
 haalanki yah is par nirbhar karata he ki sapa apana chunaav chihn shalini yadav ko detii he yaa nahin
 On January 9, 2017, Tej Bahadur Yadav of Rewari, Haryana, made public the video of the food being served to the soldiers and the atmosphere of the entire country was warmed
 yadav ne kuch video post kiye the, jinamein sirf haldi or namak vaali daal or saath main jali hui rotiyaan dikhaate hue khaane kii quality par unhone sawaal uthaae the
 In the video, he had said that this type of food is served in many places including the Line of Control near Pakistan and sometimes the soldiers have to sleep hungry
 video ke soshal media par viral hone ke baad pradhanmantri karyaalay ne kendriya grih mantralay or biguef se maamle par vistrut rapat maangi thi
 Meanwhile Teja Bahadur applied for VRS, which was not approved but he was directed that he cannot leave the BSF until the investigation is complete
 iske virodh main tej bahadur rajouri sthit mukhyalay main bhukh hadtaal par baith gaye the
 On 19 April Tej Bahadur was dismissed from the BSF
 un par seemaa suraksha bal kaa anushaasan todane ko lekar jaanch kii gai thi
 After being sacked, Teja Bahadur formed an NGO named Fauji Ekta Nyaya Kalyan Manch and now jumped into the electoral fray against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi
 ab sawaal he ki sapa ummidavaar tej bahadur kaa parchaa radd hone ke baad banaras kii chunavi ladaai par kya asar pad saktaa he
 Technically it will not make a big difference because if Tej Bahadur exits the battle, then the entry of Shalini Yadav has also been possible, but the political stature of Shalini Yadav is not such that he can influence the votes of Prime Minister Modi
 ise samajhane ke liye hamen pichley chunaav par najar daalana hoga
 In the 2014 election also, the SP had fielded its candidate in Benaras
 basapa ne bhi apana candidet diya tha
 It is a different matter that SP and BSP fought separate elections in that election, but the mathematics of their vote was ineffective
 2014 main sapa ke kailash chaurasia ko 45,291 or basapa ke vijay prakaash jaiswal ko 60,579 vot hasil hue the
 However, at that time, Aam Aadmi Party candidate Arvind Kejriwal was a big factor who got more than two lakh votes
 congress kii taraf se ajay raay is baar bhi hai or pichley baar bhi the lekin unhone bhi koi asar nahin choda tha
 Ajay Rai finished third
 uske baad uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main bhi vah pindra seat par tisare sthaan par rahe the
 Rai, who has lost two consecutive elections, is also said to be a strong candidate this time
 is baar arvind kejariwal jaisaa koi bada cheharaa banaras se nahin he, isliye aisa maan sakate hai ki bijepi virdohi vot congress or sapa ummidavaar ke liye golband hon lekin iskaa painaapan aisa nahin hoga ki narendra modi ke vijay par brake lag jaae
 Now the talk of Shalini Yadav
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan kii sambhavit ummidavaar shalini yadav ke parivaar kaa congress se purana rishta rahaa he
 She is the daughter-in-law of late Congress leader and former Rajya Sabha Deputy Shyamlal Yadav
 banaras main meyar ke chunaav main unhen maatr 1
 13 lakh votes were received and she lost the election
 isse andaja lagaana aasaan he ki shalini yadav kaa prabhaav varanasi loksabhaa chunaav par kitna asarkaari hoga
 Regardless of what the Congress and SP-BSP alliance say, candidates like Narendra Modi have been fielded, it can be said that this time the election of Varanasi has been out of the discussion
 ek tarah se vipakshi dalon ne narendra modi ko walkover de diya he
 The bottom line of the last election shows that Narendra Modi visited Varanasi in 2014 under a special strategy
 ve apane makasad main kaamyaab bhi hue
 This is also the case this time
 shuru main aisa laga ki vipakshi dal modi ko gherne ke liye koi saajha ummidavaar utaarenge lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 Signs of this had already started to meet as the delay in announcing opposition candidates from Varanasi gave full credence to this possibility
 congress kii taraf se priyanka gandhi kii ummidavaari kii charchaa chal padi thi
 There was an increase in curiosity among the people, but with the announcement of candidature of Shalini Yadav and then Ajay Rai, the curiosity about the Varanasi seat came to an end
 congress ke liye ghate kii baat ye rahi ki ain vakt priyanka gandhi kaa chunaav na ladanaa or ajay raay kii ummidavaari ne congress ko zyada taiyaari karne kaa mauka nahin diya
 It is certain that if the Congress had given a strong candidate in Varanasi instead of Ajay Rai, the fight would have been interesting and its effect would have been seen in the surrounding seats as well but it could not happen

 Scriptfilm has a good thinking which focuses on the 'swingers' and Vikram has done his best to show it
 vikram ne intimet seens ke saath samaaj ke ek khaas group kii maansikta kaa bhi zikr karne kii koshish kii he
 However, the film has a slow pace which could have been faster as well as more twists could be shown
 saath hi film kaa makasad pyaar he, badla he yaa kya he, ye bhi pataa nahin chal paata he
 The film is full of bold scenes

 Police say multiplexes may not deter viewers from carrying food items

 Explain that under the Cinema Regulation Act, 1955 (cinema Regulation Act, 1955) there is no restriction on carrying food and beverages
 distributor venkateshwar raav ke mutabik, "ye kanoon kai saalon se tha lekin theatre ke kaarobaar main jo log hai unhone is khatm kar diya he

 In this direction, the Maharashtra government has recently allowed food to be taken in the hall

 National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah has openly challenged the Article 370 of the PDP-BJP coalition government, which is running the government jointly in Jammu and Kashmir
 guuruuvaar ko ek raily main abdulla ne kaha ki jaan de denge, lekin dhara 370 nahin hatane denge
 If Article 370 is removed, the situation will be uncontrollable
 Farooq Abdullah said that if Section 370 is removed then the situation in Kashmir can be uncontrollable
 beshak abdulla kaa ye stand nayaa nahin, magar abaki baar faruk abdulla ke nishane par sirf centre sarkaar hi nahin, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh bhi he
 After Farooq's statement, the coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir has become a compulsion for the BJP to clear its position on 370 again
 neshnal conference ke netaa ne raily main maujuud logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki sena hamaari maalik nahin he, sena se daro mat
 Peace is needed here too - peace should be there
 unhone kaha ki vaaya kashmir bharat or pakistan ke bich dosti vakt kii jarurat he
 What is striking about the PDP and NC on Section 370 is that the attitude of PDP, bjp's ally on Article 370, is the same as that of Farooq Abdullah's party
 faruk ke baad algaavvaadi, hurriyat conference or aatanki bhi dhara-370 ko lekar yahi stand rakhte hai
 It is clear that the views of both the major political parties of Jammu and Kashmir do not match the idea of the Central Government

 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to Benaras to contest elections last year, there was a new hope among the people of the city who had been suffering for decades
 modi ji ne is ummid ko pukhta karte hue banaras ke vikaas kii kai yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi kii, lekin ab ek saal hone ko he, or unki sabhi yojanaayen pitaron main hi band hai
 No work has been started on any plan
 in pariyojnaon main ek ko pradhanmantri kii mahatvakankshi pariyojna bataaya jaataa rahaa he, jo bunakaron ke liye thi
 Under this, they will not only be trained under one roof, but they will also be given ways to make the market easier as well as to ease their problems
 takreeban 200 karod rupee kii laagat vaale is trade-fecilated centre kaa shilanyas pichley saal 7 november ko pradhanmantri ne bade jor-shor ke saath kiya tha or kaha tha ki yah yojana bunakaron kii takadir badal degi
 But today, seven months have passed, and far from keeping the brick here, the dispute of transfer of land has not yet been resolved
 khud kapadaa mantri santosh gangavar kehete hai, "yah project sava do saal main puraa hoga
 
 
 The Banaras Development Authority is yet to get its permission, and work will start as soon as permission is granted
 
 
 ham bina anumati kaam shuru nahin kar sakate, lekin hamen lagata he ki ek-dedh maheene main anumati mil jaani chahie
 
 
 " shilanyas or ghoshnaa ke baad shuruyaat kii intazaar main sirf yahi akeli yojana nahin he
 There are many other such schemes, prominent among which is the plan to build a teachers training center worth Rs 600 crore in Banaras Hindu University, which was also laid by the Prime Minister
 isi tarah kii anya yojanaayen hai - 500 karod rupee kii deazal rail ingine vistarikaran yojana, 250 karod kii banaras kaint railway stesan kii remodeling kii yojana, jisamen sirf sansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai, 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 Similarly, to save the heritage form of Varanasi, a 90 crore Hriday scheme and a plan to provide wi-fi facilities and cleanliness at the ghats of the city are also waiting for the beginning, and meanwhile Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has 18,000 Shown dreams of new schemes worth crores of rupees
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se kaha, "centre sarkaar vibhinn vibhaagon se 18,000 karod rupee varanasi or aasapaas ke ilaakon ko viksit karne ke liye de rahi he, jinamein sadak, bijli, sinchai, shiksha, pani jaise muddon se judi yojanaon shaamil hai
 
 
 If all these plans are completed, then the Benares will change
 
 
 " When the old promises are still not visible on the ground, these new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu are unable to excite
 sarkaar bhi jaanati he ki janata is ek saal kaa hisaab maangegi, isliye 26 may se sarkaar apane kaamkaaj kaa byoraa janata ko dene ke liye kaaryakartaaon ko taiyaar kar rahi he
 In the Parliamentary constituency of the Prime Minister, Venkaiah Naidu requested the party workers to go door-to-door to inform the public about the development plans

 shaayad isiilie dashakon se badahaali jhel rahe banaras ke log ab bhi pradhanmantri ke sapanom ke banaras ko nahin dekh paa rahe hai
 Among these projects, one has been described as an ambitious project of the Prime Minister, which was for the weavers
 iske tahat unhen ek hi chat ke neeche na sirf training di jaaegi, balki unhen bazaar uplabdh karaane ke saath-saath unki har mushkil ko aasaan karne ke raste bhi bataae jaaenge
 On November 7 last year, the Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of this trade-facilitated center costing around Rs 200 crore and said that the scheme will change the fate of the weavers
 lekin aaj saat maheene guzar chuke hai, or yahaan eent rakhana to dur, abhi jameen ke hastantaran kaa vivaad hi nahin sulajhaa he
 Textiles Minister Santosh Gangwar himself says, "this project will be completed in a quarter to two years
 
 
 banaras vikaas praadhikaran se isaki anumati abhi nahin mili he, or jaise hi anumati milegi, kaam shuru ho jayega
 
 
 We cannot start the work without permission, but we feel that permission should be given in a month and a half

 Other similar schemes are - Rs 500 crore Diesel Rail Engine Expansion Scheme, Rs 250 crore Banaras Cantt Railway Station Remodeling Scheme, with 36 lakhs from Parliament Fund alone, 900 crore underground cable scheme
 isi prakaar varanasi ke heritage swaroop ko bachaae rakhane ke liye 90 karod kii hriday yojana tathaa shahar ke ghaaton par vaai-faai kii suvidha dene or safai karwaane kii yojana bhi philhal shuruyaat kaa intazaar hi kar rahi he, or is bich kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu 18,000 karod rupee kii nai yojanaon kaa sapana dikhaa gaye
 He told the activists, "the central government is paying Rs 18,000 crore from various departments to develop Varanasi and the surrounding areas, including schemes related to issues like roads, electricity, irrigation, education, water
 
 
 ye sabhi yojanaayen puri ho jaaengi, to banaras kii rup-rekha badal jaaegi
 
 
 " jab puraane vaade hi ab tak zamin par dikhaai nahin de rahe hai, so, venkaiya naidu ke ye nae sapane utsahit nahin kar paa rahe hai
 The government also knows that the public will ask for accounts for this one year, so from May 26, the government is preparing the workers to give details of their work to the public
 pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra main venkaiya naidu ne party kaaryakartaaon se ghar-ghar jaakar janata ko vikaas kii yojanaon ke bare main jaankaree dene kii taakid di
 The comments vaise, dar yah bhi he ki janata jab puraane vaadon kaa hisaab maangegi, to kahin kaaryakarta un sawaalon se niraash na ho jaaen
 
 
 So their morale is being boosted by saying, "people are saying, it's been nine months
 
 
 are, nau maheene main to baccha paidaa hota he, lekin kya vah paidaa hote hi daudane lagata he
 
 
 Still see, the government is running
 
 
 isliye aap sab log ghar-ghar jaaen, or sarkaar kii ab tak kii uplabdhiyaan bataaen
 
 
 " lekin jis tarah ek saal hone ke baad bhi vaadon ko puraa karne kii disha main koi jumbeish zamin par dikhaai nahin de rahi he, usase banaras ke logon ko lagane laga he ki vikaas ke saare vaade yahaan kii oobad-khabad or dhul bhari sadakon par kahin kho gaye hai, jinhen dhundhakar laana vaada karne vaale mantriyon ke bas kii bhi baat nahin he
 Perhaps that's why the people of Benaras, who have been suffering for decades, are still unable to see the Prime Minister's dream of Banaras

 There are many other such schemes, prominent among which is the plan to build a teachers training center worth Rs 600 crore in Banaras Hindu University, which was also laid by the Prime Minister
 isi tarah kii anya yojanaayen hai - 500 karod rupee kii deazal rail ingine vistarikaran yojana, 250 karod kii banaras kaint railway stesan kii remodeling kii yojana, jisamen sirf sansad nidhi se 36 lakh lage hai, 900 karod kii bhumigat cabel yojana
 Similarly, to save the heritage form of Varanasi, a 90 crore Hriday scheme and a plan to provide wi-fi facilities and cleanliness at the ghats of the city are also waiting for the beginning, and meanwhile Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu has 18,000 Shown dreams of new schemes worth crores of rupees
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se kaha, "centre sarkaar vibhinn vibhaagon se 18,000 karod rupee varanasi or aasapaas ke ilaakon ko viksit karne ke liye de rahi he, jinamein sadak, bijli, sinchai, shiksha, pani jaise muddon se judi yojanaon shaamil hai
 
 
 If all these plans are completed, then the Benares will change
 
 
 " When the old promises are still not visible on the ground, these new dreams of Venkaiah Naidu are unable to excite
 sarkaar bhi jaanati he ki janata is ek saal kaa hisaab maangegi, isliye 26 may se sarkaar apane kaamkaaj kaa byoraa janata ko dene ke liye kaaryakartaaon ko taiyaar kar rahi he
 In the Parliamentary constituency of the Prime Minister, Venkaiah Naidu requested the party workers to go door-to-door to inform the public about the development plans

 In the cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, a long pending proposal related to regularization of these colonies was accepted

 Urban Development Minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said after the meeting, 'the Cabinet has given in-principle approval to regularize 205 unauthorized colonies
 ' adhikariyon ne bataaya ki 205 coloniyon main se 157 coloniyaan aanshik taur par van bhoomi par hai, jabaki 48 bastiyaan bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan kii jameen par atikaraman kar bani hai
 In September, the government regularized 895 unauthorized colonies where about 3
5 million people live
 mantrimandal ne niyamit hui sabhi coloniyon main tatkaal vikaas kaary shuru karaae jane kaa faisla kiya he
 Lovely said, 'we will bring a list of 205 colonies whose regularization has been approved by the Cabinet in the next 15 days
 'sarkaar ne sabhi teenon nagar nigamon se pehle hi niyamit kii ja chuki coloniyon ke liye leout yojanaayen banane main peshewar vaastukaron kii madad lene ko kaha he
 It had issued temporary regularization certificates to 1639 unauthorized colonies before the 2008 assembly elections
 tab shila sarkaar ne pramaan-patr vitarit karte hue vaayada kiya tha ki yadi congress teesri baar satta main ai to coloniyon ko niyamit kar diya jayega
 After the Congress' defeat in the municipal elections in April, Sheila had asked all concerned departments to speed up the process of regularization

 The Attorney General described the demand as impractical
 supreme court ne AG se is mukademe main madad karne ko kaha tha
 The court had asked Venugopal whether there should be a collegium headed by the CJI in the matter of allocation of sensitive cases like appointment of judges
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki isamen koi vivaad nahin ki CJI master of roster hai
 Prima facie we feel that this can be resolved by rectifying the in-house process, but not in a judicial manner
 supreme court ko ye tay karnaa he ki mukademon kaa aavanton kaise ho, koun kare?vaise bhi supreme court main rojaanaa sankadon nae maamle aate hai
 In such a situation, how will the judicial work be done if the five judges of the collegium decide this? This method does not seem practical
 jajon kaa kaam sirf nyaay dena nahin balki loktantr or samvidhan kii suraksha or kanoon ke shashan ko barkaraar rakhana bhi he
 During the hearing of Shantibhushan's plea, the Supreme Court flatly refused to hear or speak on the press conference of the four judges
 court ne kaha tha ki is par koi baat nahin karenge supreme court ne kaha ki koun sa cese samvedansheel he ye koun tay karegaa? kisi ke liye koi maamla samvedansheel ho saktaa he kisi ke liye koi or

 Political reasons are being cited behind the hanging of Joseph's file
 ye alag baat he ki justise joseph ke faislon kii fans kaleje main chubhe hone ke baavjood sarkaar, unke mantri or adhikari is baat se inkaar karte hai
 The reason is said to be the rules and regulations of the law
 sarkaar ne ye bhi kaha ki supreme court ke faisle ke mutabik sarkaar ko colegium kii siforishein apni aapattiyon ke saath phir se vichaar ke liye waapas bhejne kaa adhikaar sarkaar kaa he
 The government is exercising the same right
 saath hi colegium ko suzav bhi bheja he ki supreme court main anusuchit jati or janajati kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale ek bhi nyaayamurti nahin he
 Why not think about collegium? lekin ab to ye tay he ki colegium ne dobaaraa justise joseph ke naam kii sifarish sarkaar ko bhej di to maamla fansega
