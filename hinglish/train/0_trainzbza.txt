 farm bharne ke liye 590 rupee kaa draft bhejnaa hoga
 If the student's claim turns out to be correct, then the money will be retained if the money is not returned

 raveesh sar, i am Aniket Saurav (from Sitamarhi Bihar) a 10th standard student
 main pariksha de rahaa hum
 When i came home with a math paper of 10th, it came to know that the exam has been canceled and the new exam is probably on 26th of April
 maine banaras hindu vidhyalay kaa farm bharaa he
 For this, a form of 406 rupees is filled
 patna se banaras kii train ke liye 470 rupee kaa tikat liya he
 If i go to 23 and catch a train to Benares on 24, then i will miss my exam
 meraa sapana tut gaya raveesh sar, baahar ke college main padhane kaa, maa baap mahangi uniwarsity main nahin padhaa sakate hai
 The dream of many children like me is broken
 ab agar pradhanmantri dukh zaahir bhi karte hai to kya faaydaa
 i am very sad, i do not feel like doing anything
 kya aap biechayu ko date aage badhaane ke liye kah sakate hai to badi krupa hogi
 Aniket Saurabh, Sitamarhi Bihar agar aisa he to maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ke dhyaan main in baton ko turant laayaa janaa chahie taaki pariksha radd hone ke kaaran chaatro ko duusari pravesh parikshaon main shaamil hone se vanchit na hona pade
 You know that Banaras Hindu School is also a part of BHU
 yahaan 11veen ke liye pravesh pariksha hoti he
 We do not even know how many such examinations take place, but if the HR Minister wants, then the students can get great relief
 30 march ko bharat sarkaar ke shiksha sachiv anil swaroop press ke saamne aae or unhone kaha ki dasvin kii ganit kii pariksha july main hogi
 If canceled, it will be done only for the areas of Haryana and Delhi
 arthshaastra kii pariksha 25 april ko hogi
 It will take 15 more days to decide on which July will take place
 shiksha sachiv kehete hai ki shikaayatein aati hai magar har shikaayat ke aadhaar par pariksha radd nahin kar sakate hai
 This is true, but it does not give an answer as to what action was taken on the complaint that came
 aaj ek chaatr saamne aayaa he, wo daawa kar rahaa he ki 17 march ko hi usne pradhanmantri karyaalay ko patr likh diya tha magar kisi ne dhyaan nahin rakhaa
 Human Resource Minister Prakash Javadekar has also admitted that there are several stages between printing and sending a question paper
 isliye li kaa jokhim bad jaataa he
 At least they believed
 ab kah rahe hai ki ise thik karnaa hoga
 At the same time, former HRD Minister Kapil Sibal is demanding that the Prime Minister apologize to the students, but Sibal's question is something else
 wo kah rahe hai ki ab sirf ek hi prashn patr puure desh ke liye hota he, isse li hona aasaan ho gaya he
 The comments sarkaar ko ek kaam or karnaa chahie
 It can have the role of Minister of Civil Aviation and Minister of Railways
 wo yah ki sibiesai ke chaatr apana admit card dikhaakar tikat kaa puraa paisa waapas le sakate hai
 There are many parents who had ticketed to travel in India and outside India after the examination is over
 ab cancil karaayenge to unhen 40 hazaar se lekar 1 lakh tak kaa chuunaa lag saktaa he
 Since the fault is with the government, the government should make up for it
 godi media jo shiksha ke buniyadi sawaalon ko chhod kar hindu muslim tibet main aapako fansaa kar rakhana chahta he aaj kal sibiesai ke bahaane apni chhavi sudhaar rahaa he
 He is doing the news of paper leak as if he is very worried
 chintaa hoti to vah staff salection kamishan ke chaatro ne jo sawaal uthaae use bhi uthaata
 In Madhya Pradesh also talks about the students who are agitating for the Public Service Commission examination, there is a problem with the examination of Patwari
 vahaan se chaatr likh rahe hai ki patawaari kii pariksha ek privet company ne karai he
 Those who have fewer numbers are successful and those who have more are failed
 in sab baton ko ham kab gambhirtha se lenge
 Similarly, students are performing in Bengal for jobs and examinations, daily demonstrations are also held in UP, and also in Punjab
 sibiesai ke chaatro kii prishthbhumi hi he ki itnaa dhyaan mil gaya varanaa wo bhi samajhen ki shiksha vyavastha ko lekar kya haalat he desh main
 They will pass the 12th but after that how will college be
 kya sabko dilli or mumbai hi aate rahanaa hoga
 Why is there no such college in Bhopal and Patna to send someone from Delhi
 mere sawaal buniyadi hai or zaruri
 Before who wins in 2019, it is important to ask where our child will study
 kaise padhegaa
 It should be done that if a student questions that a particular question paper is wrong, then the commission itself should tell whether its claim is true or false
 kahin aisa to nahin ki paisa kamaane ke liye har pariksha main do chaar sawaal is tarah vivaadit rup se chhod die ja rahe hai kyonki ab aisi kai parikshaayen aapako desh bhar main milengi jinamein ek se lekar 15 or kabhi kabhi 40 prashn galat hote hai
 The CBSE Class 10 math exam date has troubled students in many ways
 maanav sansaadhan mantri ko dasvin or 12veen ke baad hone vaali parikshaon kii tarikhon ke bare main bhi nae sire se faisla karnaa hoga
 a student of class x from Sitamarhi in Bihar has written a letter which adds a new dimension to this problem
 aap bhi padhie
 
 
 Ravish sir, main aniket saurav (sitamarhi bihar se) ek 10veen kaa chaatr hum
 i am taking the exam
 jab main 10veen kaa ganit kaa paper dekar ghar aayaa to pataa chalaa ki pariksha radd ho gai he or shaayad nai pariksha 26 april ko he
 i have filled the form of Banaras Hindu School
 iske liye 406 rupee kaa farm bharaa he
 a ticket of Rs 470 has been taken for the train from Patna to Banaras
 main 23 ko jaakar 24 ko banaras kaa train pakadta hum to meri pariksha chhot jaaegi
 My dream is broken Ravish sir, to study in an outside college, parents cannot teach in expensive universities
 mere jaise bahut bacchon kaa sapana tut gaya he
 Now if the Prime Minister expresses sorrow, what benefit? kaaphi dukhi hum, kuch bhi karne main man nahin lag rahaa he
 If you can ask BHU to extend the date, it would be a great blessing
 aniket saurabh, sitamarhi bihar If this is the case, then these things should be brought immediately to the notice of HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar so that students are not debarred from appearing in other entrance examinations due to cancellation of examination
 aap jaanate hai ki banaras hindu vidhyalay bhi biechayu kaa hi hissaa he
 Here the entrance exam for 11th
 aisi kitni parikshaayen kahaan kahaan hoti hai, hamen pataa bhi nahin magar maanav sansaadhan mantri chahenge to chaatro ko badi raahat mil sakati he
 On March 30, Anil Swarup, Education Secretary, Government of India, appeared in front of the press and said that the Mathematics examination of class x would be held in July
 agar radd hogi to sirf haryana or dilli ke kshetra ke liye kii jaaegi
 Economics exam will be held on 25 April
 kis july ko hogi iskaa faisla karne main abhi 15 din or lagenge
 The Education Secretary says that complaints come but cannot cancel the examination on the basis of every complaint
 yah baat sahi he magar isse yah jawaab nahin miltaa ki jo shikaayat ai us par kya ection liya gaya
 Today a student has surfaced, claiming that he had written a letter to the Prime Minister's Office on March 17, but no one took care
 maanav sansaadhan mantri prakaash jaavdekar ne bhi mana he ki prashn patr ko chhapane se lekar pahunchane ke bich kai charan hote hai
 Hence the risk of leaks increases
 kam se kam unhone mana to
 Now saying that it has to be fixed
 vahiin purv maanav sansaadhan mantri kapil sibbal maang kar rahe hai ki pradhanmantri chaatro se maafee maangen magar sibbal kaa sawaal kuch or he
 They are saying that now only one question paper is for the whole country, it has become easier to leak
 tippaniyan The government should do one more thing
 isamen naagarik uddyan mantri or rail mantri kii bhoomika ho sakati he
 That is, CBSE students can withdraw their full ticket money by showing their admit card
 bahut se maa baap aise hai jinhone pariksha khatm hone ke baad bharat main or bharat ke baahar ghoomane ke liye tikat kataaya tha
 If you cancel now, it may cost them between 40 thousand and 1 lakh
 chunki galati sarkaar kii he isliye sarkaar ko hi isaki bharpai kerani chahie
 The dock media, which wants to leave the basic questions of education and entice you into Hindu Muslim Tibet, is now improving its image on the pretext of CBSE
 wo paper li kii khabaron ko aise kar rahaa he jaise use bahut chintaa he
 Had he worried, he would have also raised the questions raised by the students of the Staff Selection Commission
 madhya pradesh main lokseva ayog kii pariksha ko lekar jo chaatr andolan kar rahe hai unki bhi baat karata, vahaan patawaari kii pariksha ko lekar samasya he
 From there, students are writing that a private company has conducted the examination of Patwari
 jinke kam number hai ve safal hai or jinke zyaada hai ve fail hai
 When will we take all these things seriously? isi tarah chaatr naukariyon or pariksha ko lekar bengal main bhi pradarshan kar rahe hai, upi main bhi rose pradarshan hote hai, or punjab main bhi
 It is the background of CBSE students that got so much attention or else they also understand what is the situation in the country regarding education system
 ve 12veen to paas kar jaaenge magar uske baad college kaisaa milegaa
 Will everyone have to keep coming to Delhi and Mumbai only? bhopal or patna main aisa college kyon nahin he ki koi dilli se vahaan bhej de
 My questions are basic and important
 2019 main koun jitegaa se pehle yah poochna zaruri he ki hamaara aapkaa baccha kahaan padhegaa

 kareeb salbhar pehle desh main kisaanon ko fasal barbaadi kii samasya se bachaane ke liye pradhanmantri fasal beemaa yojana shuru hui thi
 To see how this is being applied to the land, i reached the village of Jhajjar district of Haryana
 sabase pehle main chhudaani gaanv pahunchaa
 Praveen Kumar cultivates 3 acres
 shikaayat he ki kheti ke liye kisaan credit card banwaaya to bank ne manaahi ke baavjood beemaa karke premium kaa paisa kaat liya
 According to Praveen - i have made the agriculture card
 pichhali baar jabardasti mere paise kaat liye gaye lekin maine manaa kiya phir bhi is baar phir paise kaat liye
 Vijay Kumar was forcibly insured by the bank in the previous season, but when the maize and cotton crop got bad, when the claim money was not received, this time the bank was denied insurance, but the bank still deducted the premium money in January
 took
 vijay ne bataaya, main diarect jaakar kahkar aayaa tha ki sar mere krishi card se paise nahin katane chahie
 i do not want insurance
 pichhali baar karaayaa tha to kuch nahin mila to ab kya phayda
 Still forced
 unhone tabhi kah diya tha ki nahin karwaanaa to krishi card band karvaa do apana ab aap bataaie card kaise band karvaa den? Not only this, while doing crop insurance, the bank does not even know what crop the farmer has planted
 kareeb 6 acre main kheti karne kisaan sudhir ne bataaya ki ji hamane fasal to bajre kii lagaai lekin bank ne beemaa hamaara dhan kaa kar diya
 The comments paas hi ke gaanv dulheda ke kisaan krishna chandra deshvaal ne 4 acre dhan agast main kharaab hone par beemaa company main clem ke liye phone kiya lekin aaj tak survey nahin hua beemaa kii rakam bhul jaaie
 According to Krishna Chandra Deshwal- ICICI made a call in Lombard, he said that if the crops of the entire village are bad then the survey will be done alone
 bank pahunchaa to baahar hi poster likhaa tha ki kisaan credit card se lone lene par beemaa anivaary he
 Bank manager Harish Makhija said that the guidelines are that whoever gets the agriculture card will have to be insured
 is kahani main do teen sawaal hai
 The first is that insurance is the object of solicitation, ie how can a farmer forcibly deduct premium money from his account without his consent? If the second bank insures, then do the crop that the farmer has sown
 or teesraa kisaan ko fasal kharaab hone par bime kaa paisa to mili varanaa is fasal beemaa yojana kaa phayda kya hua?

 main beemaa nahin karwaanaa chahta
 Had it been done last time, if nothing was found then what is the benefit phir bhi jabardastee kar diya
 He had then said that if not done, then close the agricultural card, now tell me how to get the card closed? yahi nahin fasal beemaa karte vaqt bank ko ye tak nahin pataa ki kisaan ne fasal koun-si lagaai he
 Farmer Sudhir said that we have planted the bajra crop but the bank has insured our paddy
 tippaniyan Farmer Krishna Chandra Deshwal of Dulhera, a village nearby, called for a claim in the insurance company after the 4-acre paddy was damaged in August, but till date, forget the insurance amount
 krishna chandra deshvaal ke mutabik- isiaisiai lombard main phone kiya to unhone kaha ki puure gaanv kii fasal kharaab hogi to survey kiya jayega akele kaa nahin kiya jayega
 When the bank reached the outside, the poster wrote that insurance is compulsory on taking a loan with Kisan Credit Card
 bank manager harish makhija ne bataaya ki guidelins ye hai ki jisko krishi card milegaa usko beemaa karnaa hoga
 There are two or three questions in this story
 pehla yah ki beemaa aagrah kii vastu he yani kisaan kii sahmati ke bina beemaa karke uske khate se premium kaa paisa jabaran kaise kaata ja saktaa he? doosraa bank beemaa kare to us fasal kaa kare jo kisaan ne boi he
 And thirdly, if the farmer gets the insurance money in case of crop failure, otherwise what is the benefit of this crop insurance scheme? yahi nahin fasal beemaa karte vaqt bank ko ye tak nahin pataa ki kisaan ne fasal koun-si lagaai he

 a research in London says that social media works to stimulate the brain a lot
 aise main bachche apni jarurat bhar kii bhi neend nahin le pate hai
 Researchers have also conducted a survey in which they found that around 70 percent of 16 to 19 year olds do social media checks before teenagers
 sone se pehle soshal media par active rahane kii unki is aadat kaa asar unke grad par padataa he
 The grades of active children on social media are up to 20 percent worse than those who live far away
 haalanki aisa to nahin hoga kiapane kabhi apane bachche ko uski is aadat ke liye tokaa nahinhoga par bachche itani aasaani se baat maan jate, to wo bachche hi kyon kehalaate
 Researchers at University College London say that being active on social media even half an hour before bed, stimulates the brain a lot, which causes difficulty in falling asleep
 skool main padhane vaale bacchon ko kam se 10 ghante sone kii salaah di jaati he par is sthiti main unki neend puri nahin ho paati he
 According to research head Dr
 Dagmara Dimitrios, it is a matter of concern that our children are not getting enough sleep
 jisaki vajah se hormones bhi asantulit hote hai
 Researchers believe that not getting enough sleep has a direct effect on the child's education

 However, some files about Bose are with the central government and some files with the West Bengal government, Chaudhary said

 ye ve maamle hai jinamein narendra modi kii aguwai vaali kendriya cabinet ke mantri fanse hue hai
 Narendra Modi had promised to make Parliament taint-free, but the ground reality is far from it
 sansad to dur, unkekhud ke mantrimandal menkarib ek tihaai mantriyon par aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 Seven out of 21 ministers who took oath on Sunday are also facing criminal cases in court
 yani ab 66 sadasyeey cabinet main daagi mantriyon kaa anupaat badhkar kareeb ek tihaai ho gaya he
 In the case of taintings, ahead of UPA, there are serious cases like rape and communal violence pending against at least five ministers in Modi Sarkar Modi cabinet
 haalanki somvaar ko vitt mantri arun jetali ne safai dete hue kaha ki cabinet main aparaadhiyon ke shaamil hone kii baat 'puri tarah niraadhaar' he
 He said, 'these cases are allegations based, not crime based
 ' unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne swayan in mantriyon kii bhalee-bhaanti jaanch kii he
 However, there are more than 20 criminal cases against Ram Shankar Katheria, MP from Agra and Minister of State for Human Resources in the Modi government
 inamen hatya kii koshish or dharmik or jaateey vidwesh badhaane jaise gambhir aarope bhi hai
 The number he got from Katheria's office was closed
 isliye vah pratikriya ke liye uplabdh nahin ho sake
 Clearly, the influx of such ministers is contrary to Narendra Modi's anti-corruption and anti-crime slogans
 balki modi cabinet main daagiyon kii taadaad purvavarti upie sarkaar ke mukaable kareeb doguni he
 For this reason, they are also being criticized on social media
 hansraj ahir par bhi 20 se zyada maamlene rasayan or urvarak rajya mantri hansraj ahir par bhi 20 se zyada maamle chal rahe hai
 These include serious cases like waging war against the state, threatening and inciting rebellion
 ahir bhi baatcheet ke liye uplabdh nahin ho paae
 But his secretary said the cases against him were politically motivated
 bijepi pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne kaha ki mantriyon par lage aarope sahi hai yaa nahin, iskaa faisla court karegaa
 He said that many of the allegations were a conspiracy by political opponents
 vahiin bihar ke navada se saansad giriraaj singh bhi aalochana ke daayre main hai
 He had written a report of theft of Rs 50 thousand at his house, but the police caught the thieves with Rs 1 crore 14 lakh
 giriraaj ne safai dete hue kaha ki yah paisa unka nahin, unke bhattije kaa tha
 The Income Tax Department was then investigating the matter
 tab se is maamle main koi nai jaankaree saamne nahin ai he
 Giriraj Singh has now been made the Minister of State in the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Industries
 yaad rahe ki sattarudh bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke khilaaf bhi farji encounter kaa cese chal rahaa he or maamle main ek baar vah giraftaar bhi kiye ja chuke hai

 He did not say anything against Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray
 unhone kaha, ‘main balasahab kaa sammaan karata hum, unke liye mere dimag main ek alag jagah he
 'significantly, after his remarks against the migrant citizens of North India recently, the Shiv Sena said that they would have trouble staying in Mumbai
 sanjay ne kaha, ‘maine kabhi suraksha ghere kii maang nahin kii or aaj maine police ayukta se apni suraksha hataane ko kaha he
 On his controversial remarks, Sanjay said, "I just said that the lives of Mumbai are in the hands of the North Indians, whether they are vegetable people or auto and taxi drivers or paan
" maine kaha tha ki agar ye log ek din kaam nahin karen, to mumbai thahar jaaegi
 i had never called for a Mumbai bandh
 ’isse pehle shivasena ke kaaryakari adhyaksh uddhav thakare ne kaha tha, ‘main nirupam ko mumbai band kar ke dikhaane kii chunauti detaa hum, ham unke daant tod denge

 halaki baad main vah in aaropon se bari hue or phir nitish kumaar ne unhen vaapis apane mantrimandal main shaamil bhi kar liya
 Later, Nitish Kumar also made him the Chief Minister of the state
 nitish kumaar ne maanjhi ke alaava ramanand prasad singh ko bhi mantrimandal se isi aadhaar par vidaa kar diya tha
 It was then said that CM Nitish does not want to see tainted faces in his cabinet

 At the same time, an argument is also being given that only an FIR has been filed against Kiteshvi Yadav, he is not charged
 aise main philhal unke khilaaf kisi tarah kaa faisla nahin hone ja rahaa
 At the same time, it is also being said that when Uma Bharti can remain in the Union Cabinet after being charge-sheeted, then why cannot she remain stunning
 haalanki jaankaar maanate hai ki nitish ne jis tarah se is puure maamle par maun dhaaran kar rakhaa he, usase prathit hota he ki vah koi tarksangat faisla lenge

 bombai ucch nyaayalay ne kings ilevan punjab ko raahat dete hue cricket board ke is ipel frenchiji kaa qaraar radd karne par roak laga di
 Justice SJ Wazifdar said that looking at the documents, Kings xi's claim seems strong

 Significantly, Justice Srikrishna, who played the role of arbitrator in the dispute between the BCCI and Rajasthan Royals, also prima facie called the cancellation of the Royals agreement illegal
 adaalat ne kings ilevan ke vakil dauris khambata ke is bayaan ko bhi ricard kiya ki adaalat yaa panchat kii sweekruti ke bina maalikon ke shairdharak pattern main badlaav nahin hoga or na hi share beche jaaenge
 The team owners include actress Preity Zinta and industrialist Ness Wadia
 qaraar radd karne ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue bisisiai ne kaha tha ki cricket board kii sahmati ke bina kings ilevan kaa swaamitv pattern badla gaya he to qaraar ke ahm niyam kaa ulanghan he
 The board has instructed Kings XI to deposit a bank guarantee of $ 1
80 million for the players selected in the auction and $ 3
5 million for BCCI within a month
 bisisiai yah guarantee chahta tha, kyonki use dar he ki frenchiji ke rup main kings ilevan ko badalane or nayi nilaamee nahin kara paane par use rajasav kaa nuksaan hoga
 Kings XI also wanted to extend today's deadline to retain older players with the team, but the court refused to give a ruling on its petition

 raat ke saadhe aath baje hai, team anna manch se utarkar vishram ke liye ja chuki he
 But the gathering of people below the stage is not diminishing
 manch ke neeche india against karpshan kii ek mahila kaaryakarta apane saathi ke saath anna ke rajnatik vikalp ke elaan par charchaa kar rahi hai
 Then there is a crowd of youth and open debate begins
 mahila kaaryakarta kahati hai, ''agar aap sochate ho ki rahul gandhi, mulaayam singh jaison se koi chhutkaaraa dilaa de, to bhaiya ye aise nahin hoga
 The dirty crop of politics has to be cleared
 
 
 ek baar to jang main kudana hi padegaa
 
 
 You guys have patience and trust
 
 
 '' tabhi toli main teen yuvak pahunchate hai
 The team is not happy with Anna's decision
 gusse main ek yuvak kahata he, ''is tarah anshan khatm nahin karnaa chahie tha
 If elections were to be fought, then they would have told in advance, why they did the drama of the movement
 
 What did you get in a year and a half? ”on August 2, after Anna Hazare announced a political option, the jantar-matar had similar views on youth
 lekin 3 agast ko anshan sthal par umada jansailab is par ekasur main khadaa dikhaa
 General (retd) V
 who took over from the UPA Government while serving as the Army Chief
 ke
 Singh's presence doubled the enthusiasm of Team Anna and supporters
 unke haathon nariyal pani pikar anna hajaare or unki team ne anshan tod diya
 The mass movement that started with Team Anna's demand for a strong law against corruption (jan Lokpal) has now risen directly to political war
 iske saath hi team anna lokapal se kaaphi aage badhate hue vyavastha parivartan kii baat karne lagi he
 Like JP, invoking the entire revolution, Arvind Kejriwal says, "this is the last chance for us after the JP movement
" dobaaraa mauka nahin aayega, hamen is maukey ko nahin khona he
 "there was no difference in the enthusiasm and passion of Kejriwal sitting on fast for 10 days
 hunkaar bharte hue ve kehete hai, ''ab bhavishya bharat kaa he
 Within the next three years, India will change and remain corruption free
 hamen bina paise ke chunaav ladakar dikhaanaa hoga
 "anna Hazare, who has been fasting on Jan Lokpal four times, agreed to make political choices when General V
 ke
 Singh, former Chief Justice V
 aar
 Krishna Iyer, former Chief Election Commissioner J
 em
 23 well-known celebrities like Lyngdoh, Anupam Kher appealed to make a choice by breaking the fast
 team ne abhi party kaa naam tay nahin kiya he, lekin ab tak kii raishumaari main 90 se 95 fisadi samarthakon ne rajnatik vikalp ke faisle ko sahi tehraaya he
 Team Anna has also announced the modalities from the selection of candidates to the declaration form and the agenda after coming to power
 jinamein satta main aane ke teen maheene ke bheetar janalokapal or rhite tu riject kanoon banane, saansadon-vidhayakon ke milane vaale vetan kaa sirf ek chauthai lene, sirf yatra ke vakt bhatta lene, lalabatti kaa istemaal band karne jaise mudde hai
 Team Anna, who has decided to embark on a political journey, realizes that the path of politics is not so easy and it is due to the arrogance and arrogance of the government that they have moved towards the political option
 yahi vajah he ki arvind kejariwal or khud anna hajaare ne anshan todate hue elaan kar diya, ''agle do saal ke bheetar yani 2014 ke aam chunaav se pehle agar upie sarkaar jan lokapal bill, janpratinidhiyon ko waapas bulaane or unhen khaarij karne ke liye rhite tu ricol or rhite tu riject kanoon paas kar de, rajnatik vikalp kii pahal ko ham waapas le lenge
 "in view of the growing frustration among the youth due to repeated hunger and negotiations with the government, this time the team took steps under a very rigorous strategy and gave the government a term till the Lok Sabha elections and told that either they The Lokpal should enact the law or it will be ready to contest in the election summer
 general ve
 K
 singh ne ritairement ke baad pehali baar saarvajanik taur par sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha kholaa
 From Anna's platform, he said, "the country has become directionless
 shashan or kanoon-vyavastha charmara chuki he
 The economy has collapsed, so people need to remember jp's slogan given in 1975, Empty the Throne
 '' is daanv se team anna ne rajnatik sugabugahat tej kar di he
 While leaders like Digvijay Singh from Congress and Ambika Soni from the government have termed it as a hidden intention of Team Anna, there is also uneasiness in BJP
 jabaki digvijay ne kaha, ''hamane pehle bhi kaha tha ki ye log raajnneeti se prerit hai or ab team anna kii rajnatik mahatvakankshaayen khule taur par saamne aa gai hai logon ko is andolan ke peeche kii vaastaviktaaon ko swayan dekhnaa chahie
 However, after this announcement by Team Anna, BJP National President Nitin Gadkari says, "we support any fight against corruption, but Team Anna cannot be an alternative to BJP in any case
" ''team anna kii ore se sabase adhik prahaar congress or bhaajapa par hi ho rahe hai, isliye kejariwal ne aaj anshan todate hue un logon ko apni party chhodkar raashtra bhakton kii toli (team anna) main aane kaa nyotaa bhi de diya jo maujuuda rajnatik dal main rahakar ghutan mahasoos kar rahe hai
 There is a difference of opinion among political parties with social organizations on Team Anna's decision of political choice
 saamaajik kaaryakarta medha patekar is pahal kaa virodh karte hue punarvichaar kii salaah de chuki hai, to ramdev ise andolan kii maut qaraar de rahe hai
 Ramdev himself has been hinting at setting up a separate political platform, but this decision by Team Anna may have an impact on Ramdev's agitation starting on August 9 on the issue of black money
 team anna ke raajnneeti main utarane kii ghoshnaa kii pariksha aagaamee chunaavon main hogi lekin itnaa tay he ki bhrashtachar ke kendriya prashn banane kaa napha-nuksaan sthapit rajnatik dalon ko jarur hoga

 This is the first time a Chinese and Pakistani flag has been waved there
 shuukravaar ko baraamula ke idgah main jume kii namaaj adaa hone ke kuch der baad kuch pradarshnakariyonne narebaaji kii
 They waved the Chinese and Pakistani flags
 pratyakshdarshiyon kaa kahana he ki pradarshnkaree binar or poster lekar narebaaji kar rahe the
 a message was written on a Chinese flag asking China to help Kashmir
 pratyakshdarshi kaa kahana he kijume kii namaajakhatm hote hi idgah ke paas kuch yuvakon ne chaar-paanch chini jhande laharaae
 All the protesters had their faces covered with clothes
 jab ek pulisavaale ne unhen rokane kii koshish kii, to pradarshnkaree patharav karne lage
 The police then used tear gas to chase down the protesters
 badanaseeb koun he? oranasibavaala koun he? aakhir ekanasibavaale or ek badanasibamen buniyadi fark kya he? koi shaks nasibavaala he yaa badanaseeb, ye tay karne kaa haq kise he?dilli vidhansabha chunaavake dauraan ek raily main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh ke liye khud ko nasibavaala bataaya tha
 During the election rally in Dwarka, Modi had said, 'petrol-diesel prices have come down and some money has started to save the public
 mere virdohi kehete hai modi nasibavaala he, isliye aisa hua
 Suppose if the price is less than my luck, then what is the need to bring a bad luck? You should tell whether you have luck or bad luck
 'modi ke is bayaan ke baad soshal media par khub bahes hui
 People in their own way responded to this
 apane bhaashan main modi ne khud ko to nasibavaala bataaya tha lekin badanaseeb koun he, is bare main unhone kisi kaa naam nahin liya
 Modi's target in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was always targeted by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, but in the Delhi elections, his target was Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party
 yahi vajah rahi ki modi ke badanaseeb vaali baat ko kejariwal se hi joda gaya
 In my mind also this question kept arising again and again
 kya main nasibavaala hum?bilkul
 i am destined, if i am not - in the newspapers someday reports of rape, honor killing or feticide
 ladkiyaan skool jaati hai
 Women can roam freely anywhere, anytime
 dahej ke liye unhen pratadit nahin kiya jaataa
 While walking on the road, they do not see anything staring at them constantly
 daftaron main pramotion ke liye koi avaanchit fevar ke liye pareshaan nahin karata
 And then another question raises another question
 kya main badanaseeb hum?aakhir main khud ko badanaseeb kyon na samajhuun - jab tivi par paanch saal kii bacchee se balaatkaar kii khabar dekhne ko milti ho
 When i read the news of unnatural sex with a three-year-old child in the newspaper
 ek ke baad ek kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hon
 a large part of the population is sleeping hungry
 ilaaj ke abhaav main hajaaron mahilaayein prasav ke vakt hi dam tod de rahi hon
 Shortly after birth, the babies are breathing
 vaaki agar mere hone se suraj ugta or duubataa he
 The wind blows
 nadiyon kaa bahaav jari he
 Trees are growing plants
 fasalein lahalha rahi hai, har taraf aman or bhaichaare kaa maahaul he - to main nishchit rup se nasibavaala hum
 But if i happen to have major accidents, droughts, floods bring ruin, tsunamis wreak havoc, earthquakes cause huge damage to life and property, then i am really unlucky
 ab jabaki dilli chunaavon main ek tathakthith badanaseeb sabase bada nasibavaala ban kar ubhara he, phir to sawaal uthne lajimi hai
 Can an unfortunate partner get along with a fated person? Does a fated person get unlucky with being unlucky? Probably not
 agar aisa hota to dilli ke nattejey kuch or hote
 It is said that luck is created by karma
 karm se hi naseeb kii dasha or disha tay hoti he
 Now do you consider yourself a destiny or unlucky? Only you have to decide
 ye aapaki duty bhi he or haq bhi

 When BJP won for the first time in a state in the south in 2008, Sehra Gowda's head was tied
 haalanki tab siem kaa pad bies yediurppa ko diya gaya tha

 mumtajibi ne apni daleel main kaha tha ki usne kabhi bhi rahimatulla ke saath samjhauta nahin kiya jise uske pati kii hatya kaa doshi qaraar diya gaya he
 The petition states that it is unlikely that he has struck a deal with Rahimtullah
 nichali adaalat ne mumtajibi kii kahani ko sahi mana lekin jila adaalat ne ise palat diya
 Due to this, he had to file a petition in the High Court

 The 2019 Lok Sabha election is considered to be the most important election in the history of Indian politics and the exit poll that preceded the results of this great shock has given a big blow to the anti-modi ideology
 bhartiya janata party ko satta se ukhaad phenkane ke jis makasad se mayawati ne puraani adaavat bhulaate hue uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party se gathbandhan kiya, usamen wo fail najar aa rahi hai
 In this sense, if the results for the BSP, which did not win a single Lok Sabha seat in 2014, match the exit poll, it would be considered the biggest setback for Mayawati in her political life
 ajtak- exis maai india ke agsit pole main upi kii kul 80 siten hai jinamein 62-68 siten bijepi ko, espi-bispi-areldi gathbandhan ko 10-16 or upie ko 1-2 siten milti dikh rahi hai
 That is, this exit poll is showing that the alliance between Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati has not worked and the situation of the Congress has not changed
 agsit pole ke mutabik, upi main bijepi ko 48 fisadi, congress ko 8 fisadi or mahagathbandhan ko 39 fisadi vot miltaa dikh rahaa he
 When the SP-BSP alliance was formed in UP, it was believed that both the big interference in the politics of the state came together and presented a tough challenge for the BJP
 donon dalon ke apane-apane votbank bhi hai
 While Mayawati is based on Dalit vote bank politics, SP has been doing politics on the yadav-muslim equation
 aise main upi ke saamaajik taane-bane main dalit-muslim or yadav votbank kii partiyon kaa gathjod dekh har koi mahagathbandhan ke liye ekatarfa nateezon kii ummid laga rahaa tha
 However, the BJP has been claiming the Mahagathbandhan to get more seats since 2014, calling it a mahamilavat
 agsit pole ke anusaar mayawati mushkil main hai
 BSP 19 when Modi wave started in 2014
 8% vot paakar ek bhi seat nahin jeet pai
 Whereas before that the BSP performed quite well
 2009 main basapa ko 27
 20 seats with 4% votes and 24 in 2004
 7% vot ke saath 19 loksabhaa siton par jeet mili thi
 Not only this, in the UP Assembly elections of 2007, the BSP formed an absolute majority government on the basis of social engineering
 lekin pehle 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main shikast paane ke baad 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jiro par rahane vaali basapa ko 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi kuch haath nahin aayaa or unki party mahaj 19 siton par simat gai
 In view of these results, perhaps Mayawati forgot the Lucknow guest house scandal and tied up with Mulayam Singh Yadav's son Akhilesh Yadav
 baavjood iske agsit pole ke jo nattejey saamne aa rahe hai, usamen mayawati kaa yah samaajawaadee formula bhi puri tarah dhwast hota dikhaai de rahaa he
 In such a situation where the discussion was going on that Mayawati is looking forward to surrendering her political legacy to her nephew and taking herself to the center of politics, the exit poll projections for Mayawati are falling behind election-like
 work done
 chunaav ayog ke bheetar baghaavat ho gai he
 Third Commissioner Ashok Lavasa has written a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora on 4 May
 usamen kaha he ki unhen majaboor kiya ja rahaa he ki ayog kii sampurna baithak main shaamil na ho
 Their disagreements are not being recorded
 sampurna baithak main teenon ayukta shaamil hote hai
 Everything is recorded
 magar yah khabar har bhartiya ko pareshaan kerani chahie ki ayog ke bheetar kahin koi khel to nahin chal rahaa he
 Ashok Lavasa also disagreed in the decision of the complaints against the Prime Minister
 ayog par sawaal uthaa tha ki vah aachaar samhita ke ullghan ke maamle main pradhanmantri kaa bachaav kar rahaa he
 Our colleague Arvind Gunasekhar has been doing this news since morning

 How can we express our trust in this commission? yah janata kaa chunaav karvaa rahaa he yaa modi kaa chunaav karvaa rahaa he
 This letter of Election Commissioner Ashok Lavasa cannot be taken lightly
 vaise hi tamaam tarah ke aarope chunaav ayog par lag rahe hai
 Is the election being managed? Are decisions being written by pressuring the commission
 bhavishya main koi saboot na bache isliye asahmati darj nahin kii ja rahi he
 Our colleague Arvind Gunasekhar has written that after this letter from Ashok Lavsa, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora called a meeting but no result was found
 sunil aroda ke tark hai ki sirf kwasi jeudicial maamalon main alpamat kii raay record kii jaati he
 The judgment given on the violation of the code of conduct is not quasi-judicial
 ham sab jaanate hai ki aisi sansthaaon kii baithkon main minutes darj hote hai
 The Prime Minister has told the Indian Express that the minutes of the Cabinet's sitting are recorded and approved
 chunaav ayog main aisa koun sa niyam he
 Sunil Arora's answer seems not enough
 chunaav ayog kii bhoomika ko lekar satark rahane kii zarurat he
 Prime Minister Kedarnath has left
 us bahaane jaldi hi hindi channelon par shiv puraana ke kaarykram bhar jaaenge
 But it is now up to the public to convey such news to the public
 yah aapke loktantr ke bhavishya kaa sawaal he

 ek ayukta likh rahaa he ki chunaav ayog kanoon se nahin chal rahaa he
 Then how do we expect that commission to conduct a fair election

 Congress attacked the BJP through a social media post, writing, 'BJP needs a journalist who reports' facts'
 lekin agar 'story sahi hui' to use jail bhi bheja ja saktaa he
 The Congress shared a poster on its Instagram account, pinching the advertisement, stating that the BJP is looking for a journalist

 In the video that can be seen, the children are sitting on the floor in the verandah of the school and they are eating bread with salt
 video jari hone ke kuch hi din baad rajya sarkaar ne us patrkaar ke khilaaf cese darj kiya he, jisane vah video shoot kiya tha
 Now there is a furore over it

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on many occasions is more attacker on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh than attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Bharatiya Janata Party directly
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue rahul gandhi sangh par apane hamale ko or tej kar sakate hai
 According to the news of Mail Today, Rahul Gandhi has shifted his focus on the Sangh in front of the base of PM Modi
 aalochakon ne aksar rahul gandhi ko 'anicchhuk rajkumaar' ke rup main varnit kiya he jo lambey samay se number do rahete hue satta to chalaate hai, lekin jimmedaari lene se dur bhaagate hai
 But from Amethi, Sansadrahul Gandhi launched the fastest attack on the Sangh this week
 rahul ne ye hamalaa jediu ke baagi netaa sharad yadav ke 'sajhi viraasat ko bachaao' kaarykram main kiya
 Here Rahul said that the RSS knows that their ideology cannot win elections in this country, so they started putting their people in constitutional institutions
 aresas jaanata he ki jis din unke log nyaaypalika, naukarshahi, sena, media main baith jaaenge, us din ye desh unka hoga
 Rahul attacked the Sangh and said that these people also learned to salute the tricolor after coming to power
 jab tak is desh main 'van main van vot rahegaa' ye desh unka ho nahin saktaa
 Rahul is speaking all this at a time when the Congress party is losing one election after another
 rahul gandhi ne sangh ke desh ko dekhne ke nazariye par bhi sawaal kiya tha or kaha tha ki desh ko dekhne ko do tareeke hote hai, ye desh meraa he, ek kahata he ki main is desh kaa hum, ye ham main or aresas main antar he
 The RSS says that this country is ours
 tum iske nahin ho
 However, the Sangh also retaliated against Rahul
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh netaa manmohan vaidya ne kaha he ki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi sangh ke bare main kuch bhi nahin jaanate hai
 RSS members took part in the freedom struggle
 congress ke sheersh netaa congress upaadhyaksh kii is ranneeti se khush hai or ve shabdon ke is yuddh ko banaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Why do they believe that Modi should be given undue credit? This is RSS, who introduced them
 vah sirf ek pratifal hai
 How can it be explained that Modi was elected to the post of Prime Minister despite the better performances of Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh? All India Congress Committee General Secretary CP Joshi told Mail Today- 'the existence of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh since 1925 It lasted until 1947
 or swatantraaa sangram main unki bhoomika kya thi? aresas hameshaa se raajnneetik satta par kabja karne ke liye prayasarat rahaa
 Now that he is in power, he is trying to rewrite history and change everything
 joshi ne kaha ki bhaajapa tab praasangik hui, jab modi aae
 It is now a direct struggle of ideologies between the Congress and the RSS
 party ke varishton kaa kahana he ki oktober main congress ke aantarik chunaav ke baad ek sateek abhiyaan ranneeti taiyaar kii jaaegi
 There is a lot of dissatisfaction among the people with the ideology of RSS and their radical way
 ek varisht congressi padaadhikari ne kaha ki sangh par hamalaa karne kii ranneeti mukhya rup se rahul gandhi kaa idia he or ek baar vah jab party ko puri tarah se sambhaal lenge to 2019 ke liye party kii ranneeti main ullekhneey badlaav dikhaai dene lagegaa

 'bonus milane ke baad logon kaa riection Madhya Pradesh has written a story of progress in the last few years in comparison to the despair of agriculture in the rest of the country

 isse is kshetra ko soobe main acchhee-khaasi siyaasi ahmiyat mil jaati he, jise siyaasi kartadharta nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 While this increase in agriculture can be called a direct result of the policy initiative of the state government, a large part of it has been achieved on the strength of the people

 Assembly elections are going to be held this year and whatever vote will be either in their favor or against them

 At a time when the battlefield is ready and warlords are calculating their equipment, Nitish Kumar has postponed his most popular program of five years: the weekly Janata Durbar, the occasion when the Chief Minister's residence / The doors of the office were open to the common man and they could bring their problems directly to them
 ab ve rajyavyapee daure par nikal gaye hai
 They will visit 38 districts of the state and reach out to those who could not be part of Janata Durbar to be held on Monday
 kya nitish chunaav se pehle thode vyagr ho rahe hai, unhen ab apane taj ko bachaana he? kya unhen lagata he ki unki saakh paryaapt nahin he?sambhawatah ejeeniyar se raajnneetik bane nitish pehla kadam uthaakar zyada se zyada laabh arjeet karne ke liye lalayit hai
 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi says, "nitish Kumar is a sharp-witted person and works for 15-16 hours
 ve har kaam ko uske nattejey tak pahunchaate hai or vichaaron ko kriyanvit bhi karte hai
 Like every person who touches the heights, Nitish is also beset with some problems - some of which are his own
 haalanki unke nae saamaajik samikarnon ne nae dost banaae hai to aise bhi log hai jo kabhi unke saath khadey the lekin ab un logon main unke liye pehle jaisaa prem nahin rahaa he
 During his visit, Nitish is checking primary health centers, inspecting PDS shops and asking workers in private whether they are being given a minimum wage
 unki is anubhavjanya padtaal kaa samay ise saamaanya prashasnic kadam se thodaa hatakar bana detaa he
 Nitish has already achieved a position that his rival RJD chief is still struggling to achieve when it comes to getting ahead of others with strict discipline
 yahi nahin, ve hameshaa hi puri tarah se shant, atyadhik suspasht or khatarnaak rup se kootnithik najar aate hai
 Still, all is not well for him in this ongoing election competition
 2005 main nitish ko lalu ke varchasv ke khilaaf har taraf se bharpoor samarthan mila tha
 It was a time when people from different castes and sympathizers of different views of the social and political world, from upper caste to highly backward class (EBC) voters, from businessmen to professionals and from housewives to students, wholeheartedly supported them
 did
 ab, unke kai doston-jaise munger ke saasand rajeev ranjan singh urf lallan or purv saansad prabhunath singh, jinhone kabhi lalu ke khilaaf unka samarthan kiya tha-ne unako satta se baahar karne ke liye morcha sambhala hua he
 Many others who left others to support Nitish, such as former minister Nagamani, have also switched sides and are now united day and night to work against him
 agar ye netaa apane samarthan aadhaar kaa jaraa sa hissaa bhi nitish se waapas khinch lete hai to ve nitish ke satta main ek baar phir lautne kii yojanaonko khaasaa nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 But, why did so many friends leave him? Is it because success always costs something? Or is it because they have started showing different moods? It seems that there are some reasons for both
 unako chhodkar jane waalon kaa aarope he ki ve ''ek aise swechhachari hai jo har kisi se apni baat manvaanaa chaahate hai
 "nagmani says," They do not allow even a ratty to happen from here to there
 ve cabinet baithak ke dauraan bhi charchaa pasand nahin karte
 Last year, BJP MP Bhola Singh — who once criticized Nitish at a meeting of the NDA Legislature Party at the Chief Minister's official residence — got tired of asking for an appointment, but neither got the time and Nor could he meet the Chief Minister
 nitish sarkaar kii sabase badi uplabdhi rajya main aparaadh par lagaam kasnaa he, haalanki yah ummiido se thodaa kam he
 44,000 offenders have been sentenced since 2006, a figure that is quite impressive

 35 fisadi kii dar se vruddhi kar rahi he or akele pichley vitt varsh ke dauraan 2,417 kimi sadakon kaa nirmaan ho chukaa he
 Not only this, Nitish has also taken a strong stand on nepotism, this nepotism is said to be the main reason for the downfall of Lalu and Paswan, which had transformed their parties into a dynastic fiefdom
 abhi tak, aakraamak saamaajik nyaay ke saath vikaas sambandhi unke dohare lakshya chunavi phayda dete rahe hai
 Keeping an eye on the vote bank, he has increased the dearness allowance of state government employees and increased the salary of special assistant police personnel

 Presented a budget with surplus revenue of Rs
 raajnneeti kii jarurat ne hi kai maukon par nitish ko jo ve kehete hai or jo karte hai, usamen maamuli antar laane ke liye majaboor kiya
 Since taking over as Chief Minister since November 24, 2005, Nitish has expanded his Mandal Club by including Mahadalits and has also garnered some minority support for which his Muslim-backed policies are responsible
 aaj, paswan or lalu jaanate hai ki nitish puri koshish main hai ki unke vot bank main send lagaai jaae
 Despite his insistence on caste-less politics and promotion of sub-nationalism, he does not miss attending rallies and meetings organized by various caste groups
 beshak baithak brahman samaaj raajnneetik chetana samiti kii ho yaa phir ek mahadalit sabha ho, unhone chunaav ke maddanager sabhi baithkon main shirkat kii he
 His critics allege that Nitish is playing caste-based cards with great vigor
 unke mahadalit prayog ke tahat bihar main 22 dalit jatiyon main se 21 jatiyon ko vishesh phaayde ke liye mahadaliton main shaamil kiya gaya he
 The 22nd caste Dusadh — identified with anti-ljp president Ram Vilas Paswan — is excluded from the list, though separate promises have been made for them
 yah adhiktar logon ko hairat main daalane ke liye kaaphi he ki aakhir yah vargeekaran, kya jaruri he
 Nitish is also engaged in conflating Mandal and Progressivism
 is sandarbh main atyadhik pichhadaa varg ke liye panchayat siton main 20 fisadi or mahilaon ke liye 50 fisadi aarakshan liya ja saktaa he
 These are very clever political steps, which will help them to spread the idea of their mandal among the backward castes on a wide scale
 iske alaava mahilaon ke rup main unki nai aadhaar bhoomi bhi taiyaar hogi
 Despite the opposition of party president Sharad Yadav, her support of the Women's Reservation Bill in Parliament appears to be a deliberate attempt to come out of the stereotype of the political imprint of Mandal
 agar jarurat padane par nitish kisi bhi baat par ekadam se apana rukh tay kar lete hai, to ve vyaavhaarik raajnneeti main jarurat padane par taalane vaala rukh akhriyaar karne se bhi peeche nahin rahete hai
 For example, steps can be taken to keep the tenancy program in abeyance
 unhone aisa tab kiya jab ucch jati ke netaa unke khilaaf ekajute ho gaye
 Nitish's entire focus is to unite his positive aspects, then obviously push his opponents down
 donon hi morchon par date rahane ke liye atyadhik urja or rajnatik puunji kii darkaar rahati he, aise main nitish ko bihar kii satta dobaaraa sanbhaalane ke liye duusari sabhi baton ko apane dohare agenda ke tahat rakhana hoga
 They also have to forget the popular and important things coming in the way of their top priority, just like the Janata Durbar
 sabhi sanketon ko dekhen to sambhawatah isliye bihar ke mukhyamantri, jo vidhaan parishad ke sadsy hai, is baar phir khud chunaav ladane se khud ko dur rakhen
 For an outsider, all this does not seem to match the personality-based politics of Bihar - or the image of Nitish's public leader
 lekin is chunavi varsh main, nitish ne yah akalan chunaav prachaar or ranneeti banane kii apni dohari jimmedaari ko dekhakar kiya hoga ki chunaav nahin ladane par ve kisi khaas seat se bina bandhe hi puure rajya par dhyaan kendrit kar sakate hai
 Instead of contesting his election, this step of focusing solely on publicity and strategy making is also known from the past
 pichley saal hua loksabhaa chunaav pehla mauka tha jab pichley bees saalon main nitish kumaar ne nijee taur par pehali baar kisi seat se chunaav nahin ladaa tha
 But the NDA won 32 of the 40 seats in the state, and its victories alone can be given full credit for this victory
 halanki nitish haar ko jeet kii hi tarah bahut hi shishtataa or sanyam ke saath nahin lete
 In September last year, when the NDA lost 13 of the 18 seats in the by-election, they called it a "mere practice match" and blamed everyone for it, including the voters
 unhone kaha ki matadaata lalu or paswan ko bihar main waapas laane ke nakaaratmak prabhaav bhaanpane main asafal rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar is apparently seen to be a big hit on the RJD chief due to giving a much better government than Lalu Prasad Yadav
 yahi nahin, agar baat soshal ejineering kii karen to unhone bhi vahi sab kiya jo lalu ne kiya tha, beshak unase kuch zyada hi or vah bhi bahut hi parishkrut andaaj ke saath
 But the problems still exist
 bhaajapa unke alpsankhyak samarthit nazariye ke saath khud ko sahaj mahasoos nahin karti
 But Nitish seems completely confident
 sambhawatah unke andar kaa ejeeniyar is baat ko bhalee-bhaanti jaanata he ki chijen behatar hone se pehle aksar kaaphi badtar ho jaaya karti hai
 Congress lower-level activists have demanded several times to bring Priyanka Gandhi into active politics, but now the same demand has been raised by the former Chief Minister of Punjab and Amritsar MP Captain Amarinder Singh
 unhone kaha he ki ab priyanka ko rahul kii madad ke liye aage aana chahie
 Amarinder Singh today strongly advocated that Priyanka Gandhi be active in politics and said that she and Rahul Gandhi can complement each other for the benefit of the party
 unhone kaha, 'aise samay jab bharat main 70 fisadi log 40 saal se kam umr ke hai, donon milakar poorak bhoomikaaon main kaam karen to hamen kaaphi khushi hogi
 'he said that both are' knowledgeable and futuristic 'and know what is happening in the world

 He said that it is for Rahul to decide whether he wants to become the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha

 Earlier, outgoing Food Minister KV Thomas had said, "as a member of Congress, i want Priyanka to come to the main field

 ' congress nit centre sarkaar par dabaav banane ke liye bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne 22 november se shuru ho rahe sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr se ek din pehle manhagaai, bhrashtachar, ghotaalon or epadiai ke khilaaf deshvyapee ‘hallaa bol’ andolan karne kaa nirnay kiya he
 Almost all the top leaders of the party will participate in this Halla Bol program
 party upaadhyaksh mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne ye jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki 21 november ko desh ke sabhi jilon main ukt muddon ke alaava pradhanmantri karyaalay or upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke parivaar par lage gambhir bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko bhi ujagar kiya jayega
 He said, 'the Congress-led central government's' numerical mathematics in Parliament and mass mathematics on the road' has deteriorated
 iske baavjood bhi sarkaar janvirohi evam desh hiton ko nuksaan panhuchane vaale faisle le rahi he
 Naqvi alleged that in the last eight-and-a-half years of UPA rule, two major decisions of nuclear deal and foreign direct investment in retail were taken and both were taken into consideration with foreign interests
 upie sarkaar ke khilaaf is deshvyapee pradarshan main arunachal pradesh main nitin gadakari, mumbai main arun jetali, dilli main murali manohar joshi, hyderabad main em venkaiya naidu, dilli main rajnath singh or nakvi, lakhanu main annat kumaar, jaipur main ravishankar prasad, goa main shahanvaj hossain, kolkata main nirmala sitaraman aadi andolan kii aguwai karenge
 According to Naqvi, LK Advani and Sushma Swaraj will not participate in the Halla Bol movement on the same day due to the NDA meeting held in Parliament to chalk out a strategy against the government
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) hameshaa nitish kumaar ke prati udaar rahi he
 It had won 67 seats in the 2000 Bihar assembly elections, almost double the 34 seats of Nitish Kumar's Samata Party (SP)
 phir bhi usne mukhyamantri pad ke liye nitish kumaar kaa naam hi aage kiya tha
 He resigned within seven days but it was the beginning of a long friendship in which Nitish was given the role of senior partner
 yah gathbandhan 2005 main vijayi rahaa or 2010 main to yah jabardast teen chauthai bahumat ke saath satta main aayaa
 Apparently, the BJP is upset with Nitish's targeting of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and his threats to break the alliance
 lekin nitish endie ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kii daud se modi ko baahar rakhane kii apni jid main asal nuksaan uthaane vaale sabit ho sakate hai
 Nitish's party Janata Dal (united) JDU believes that breaking their alliance with BJP will not do them much harm
 nitish ne satta main rahete hue lakshith saamaajik kalyaan upaay apanaakar vanchit virgon kaa ek vyapak saamaajik gathbandhan taiyaar kiya he
 To support their original Kurmi vote bank, they have successfully formed a new support group by joining even the caste neutral neutral voters like the Backward Castes (ebcs), Mahadalits, backward Muslims and women and thus have become almost invincible in Bihar Huh
 nitish kaa safal saamaajik gathbandhan yadav, paswan, bhoomihaar or brahmanon ke paramparaagat rup se taqatvar saamaajik guton ke dabadabe ko ulatney ke liye taiyaar kiya gaya he
 In doing so, he has weakened his main rivals Lalu Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan
 pehle unhone lalu ko kamjor karte hue mandal dhaanche se ati pichhadi jatiyon, jo kul matadaataaon kii takreeban 33
 There are 5 percent, separated
 phir unhone anusuchit jati main aane vaali 22 main se 21 upjatiyon ko milakar mahadaliton kaa ek nayaa saamaajik samooh taiyaar kiya or lok janashaktiparty (algepi) ke paswan ko tagada jhatka diya
 The only caste he left outside this Mahadalit formulation was Paswan
 sarkaar ne muft jameen, shiksha tathaa anya sahaayta jaise kalyankari upaay apanaakar mahadaliton ko, jo kul matadaataaon ke 11 pratishat hai, santusht kiya he
 The mathematics of his social alliance for his rivals is not attested by the percentage of votes he received
 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke netaa ram kripal yadav kehete hai, ‘‘bihar main jediu ko aaj tak kabhi kul pade voton ke ek chauthai vot bhi nahin mili hai
 In the last assembly elections, JDU alone got less than 25 percent votes, but its alliance with BJP garnered around 40 percent votes
 2010 main buree tarah haarane ke baavjood argedy ko 20 pratishat vot mili the
 Without BJP, Nitish will be weak in front of Lalu, especially if he allies with lalu-paswan or Congress
 bijepi ne 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main shandaar pradarshan karte hue 90 pratishat siten jiti thim
 It is mainly supported by a group of Vaishya castes, upper castes and caste-neutral middle class
 2009 main usne 12 loksabhaa siton par vijay praapt kii thi
 The party feels that she can do even better
 pradesh ke ek varisht bijepi netaa kehete hai, ‘‘bihar kii janata kaa nitish se mohabhang ho rahaa he
 BJP seats will definitely increase
 ’’sach to yah he ki nitish ko 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke vipareet, 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii daud main ek prabal satta virdohi lahar se jujhna he
 bjp's mainstay upper castes are angry because they feel that Nitish is choosing the needs of his EBCA Mahadalit and Muslim voter supporters
 navada jile kii rukhi panchayat ke purv mukhiya ashutosh singh kehete hai, ‘‘jediu ne hamen sirf ek seedhi ke rup main istemaal kiya he
 If he breaks ties with BJP then our vote will go to BJP
 ’’nitish kaa majbootee se virodh karne vaale kuch anya taqatvar samooh bhi hai
 About 2,50,000 contracted school teachers are angry with them because they are not accepting their demand for equal pay to regular teachers
 bijepi or jediu kii raahen juda hone par bihar ke vibhinn samudaayon ke matdaan vyavhaar main badlaav dikhegaa
 Still it seems that Kurmi, EBC and Mahadalit will vote for JDU while upper castes will support BJP
 tab bhi nitish ko muslim voton ke ek bade hisse ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 He will have to fight Lalu for his vote
 jediu ke ek varisht netaa ke mutabik 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaavon or uske baad hone vaale upachunaavon main pradesh ke lagbhag 25 pratishat musalamaanon ne endie ko vot diya tha
 Only 75 percent of these remaining could be potential voters of JDU
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘yadi modi ke mudde par nitish endie se alag ho jate hai to ve musalamaanon ke chahete ke rup main usee tarah ubharenge jaise adwani ko giraftaar karne ke baad lalu ubhare the
 16 of Bihar's total population
 53 pratishat musalmaan hai or vahaan kii 40 loksabhaa siton main se aath main unke paas nirnaayak mat hona bataaya jaataa he
 Among the districts where they have maximum electoral impact are Araria, where they make up 41 of the population

 76 percent), Katihar (42
 53 pratishat) tathaa kishanganj (67
 58 percent)
 anya siton par unka asar kuch kam he
 If Nitish bets on the same community to get election success, he will take a risk
 is jokhim ko ve congress ke saath gathbandhan kar kam kar sakate hai
 The Congress gets about 10 percent of the vote and can also help to add Muslim votes
 duusari taraf, iske chalate unhen dohari satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he kyonki patna main ve satta main hai or centre main congress
 If the Congress also compromises with Lalu and Paswan, then Nitish will also have to grapple with a strong coalition against his opponents
 nitish kii raah vaaki kathin he
 Because even a small tilt of votes in a multi-cornered contest can create unpleasant surprises

 ' Ranjit alias Rakibul's case has become a case in which new truths are coming out everyday
 rishton ke daanv tale kanoon ko raundkar kamyaabi kii seedhiyaan chadhane vaala ab buree tarah funs chukaa he
 He had already been besieged by the accusation of 'love Jihad' by his wife and now the secrets that have come out of the raids in his flats have once again shocked everyone
 ranjit urf rakibul kii jindagi kisi filmi kahani se kam nahin he
 a man who was ever craving for a small amount of money, got so rich that overnight, he begged the beggar to give 500 rupees
 lekin sirf 5 saalon main usne farsh se arsh tak kaa safar kaise puraa kiya ye bhi ek bada raaj he
 He used to be poor before, he used to work in the grocery store
 kabhi wo marij party main videographer kaa liteman banataa or kabhi kisi dhabas kaa hisaab-kitaab rakhata
 But now all this is a thing of the past
 ‘lav jehad’ ke maamle main giraftaar hone se pehle ranjit urf rakibul kii amiri or thaath dekhakar log apane daanton tale ungliyaan dabaa liya karte the
 The fate of Rakibul started from 2002 and 2003
 isse pehle wo garib hua karata tha or ek aam jindagi ji rahaa tha
 But meanwhile, what happened to his fight with a boy went to jail and his fate changed
 jail se baahar aane ke baad wo 5 saalon tak bilkul gaayab hi ho gaya
 But meanwhile, when he returned, his life had changed
 wo karodon main khilne laga, usko jaanane vaale bataate hai ki pehle uske paas kai baar 10-20 rupee bhi nahin hote the, or phir vah ranchi main 3 makaanon ke liye 70 hajaar kiraaya bhi dene laga
 People who know Rakibul tell that when he returned after living an intelligence life for 5 years, he used to roam in big vehicles
 bhikhaari ko kabhi 500 kaa note pakadaa detaa to kabi 10 rupee kii cheez kharidkar apni jeb se hajaar kaa note nikaalata, uskaa ye rag dhang dekhakar log hairaan rahe jate the
 These 5 years of Rakibul are undoubtedly an enigma for the world, but now sources claim that he earned crores of rupees by doing political and judicial licensing in these 5 years
 wo apane rishte, rishwat or ladakiyon ke dam par logon ke kaam karata or kamyaabi kii seedhiyaan chadhataa gaya
 He had an old relationship with the High Court registrar Mushtaq Ahmed
 apane shooting ke shauk ko lekar wo mushtak ke saath shooting range jaaya karata tha or yaheen uski mulaakaat rashtriya str kii shooter tara shahdev kii saath hui thi
 After this, Tush had gone to the house of Tara Shahdev after taking the relation of this person who became Rakibul to Mushtaq Ahmed Ranjit and then got both of them married
 lekin ab rakibul kaa nayaa cheharaa duniya ke saamne he or ab sabko us din kaa intjaar he jab sibiai rakibul kaa puraa sach duniya ke saamne laaegi
 There is chaos in the whole of Jharkhand over the 'love Jihad' case, on the other hand many big officers and leaders of the state are scared about this matter
 kyonki police poochtacha main ranjit urf rakibul ne jo khulaase kiye hai usne rajya ke kai rasukhdaar logon kii neend uda di he
 According to the police, he used to use honeytrap to get his work done
 yani kaam ke badale paise ke saath-saath ladki bhi or police kii maane to wo apane saare gunaah kabool bhi kar rahaa he
 Ranchi's 'love Jihad' case started with the accusations of husband-wife quarrels and forced conversions, but this case has progressed far beyond 'love Jihad' to high-profile sex racket and judicial corruption
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki ek taraf jahaan jharkhand ke mukhyamantri hemanth sorain ne is maamle kii jaanch sibiai ke hawaale karne kaa elaan kiya he, vahiin duusari taraf rakibul ke najdiki mantri, megistrate or afasar apana naam saamne aane ki ulti ginati ko lekar sahame hue hai
 So far, during interrogation, Ranjit alias Rakibul has confessed to knowing more than 40 officers and ministers closely
 usne ye bhi bataaya he ki wo aksar aise logon se kaam nikalwane ke badale main unhen ladikayaan supplai kiya karata tha
 In the wake of these revelations of Rakibul, the police are now investigating the corners of his three houses in Rachi on one side and the CCTV of Ranchi's most posh player apartment on the other side and checking the laptops and 5 mobile phones of Rakibul
 electronic divyson main chhipe raaj ke tah tak jane ke liye sibar forensik ke export kii bhi madad le rahi he

 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and HRD minister Smriti Irani waged a verbal war after NSUI activists demonstrated outside the residence of the HRD minister today over the issue of de-recognition of a student organization by IIT Madras
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki manyata khatm kiye jane kaa makasad virodh ko dabaanaa he or vah is tarah kii koshishon ke khilaaf sangharsh karenge
 Irani retaliated by challenging him to debate governance issues, including education, and accused him of hiding his fight behind the NSUI
 rahul gandhi ne apane karyaalay ke twitor account par kaha, 'modi sarkaar kii aalochana karne ke liye iaiti chaatr samooh par pratibandh
 What will happen next? Freedom of expression is our right

 ' irani ne rahul ko chunauti dete hue kaha, 'mujhe samay or sthaan bataaie

 is par irani ne palatwaar karte hue unhen shiksha sahit shashan ke muddon par bahes karne kii chunauti di or un par enesayuai ke peeche chhipakar apni ladaai ladane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Rahul Gandhi on his office's Twitter account said, 'ban on IIT student group for criticizing Modi government

 We will fight against any attempt to suppress disagreement and discussion
 ' Responding to this, Irani said in his comments on Twitter, 'next time fight your own battles, don't hide behind NSUI

 dilli vidhansabha chunaav main matdaan se thik pehle chandani chowk main narendra modi ne ek jansabha kii thi, jisamen unhone pehali baar aam aadmi party ke bare main kuch shabd kahe the
 
 
 Without naming Arvind Kejriwal, he said that the people of Delhi should not trust those who betrayed a saint like Anna Hazare
 
 
 bijepi ke ranneetikaar aam aadmi party ko dilli ke chunaav main zyaada gambhirtha se nahin le rahe the, or shaayad yahi vajah thi ki modi ne bhi apane bhaashanon main kejariwal or unki party ko zyada tarjeeh nahin di thi
 
 
 But the BJP had to bear the brunt of ignoring the Aam Aadmi Party
 
 
 badi sankhya main yuvaaon or madhya varg ne jhaadu ko vot diya
 
 
 The historic success of the Aam Aadmi Party spoiled the BJP equation
 
 
 kejariwal kii party ne bijepi ko dilli main satta main aane se roak diya
 
 
 After this, forgetting the bjp's success in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, the media started shouting at Kejriwal day and night
 
 
 yah baat alag he ki kejariwal ne dilli main 49 din kii sarkaar jis tarah chalaai or istipha diya, usase dilli main unhen vot dene vaale ek bade tabake kii naaraazgi jhelni padi
 
 
 Now Arvind Kejriwal is once again in the headlines
 
 
 puure desh main unki party ne 300 se zyaada ummidavaar loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke liye khade kar die hai
 
 
 In many places, the clean image of his candidates is also attracting voters towards this party
 
 
 dilli main sarkaar chhodane par kejariwal logon ko safai de rahe hai
 
 
 Looking at the predictability of Narendra Modi's victory in public opinion polls, Kejriwal has started targeting him
 
 
 gujarat main road sho kar modi par tikhe hamale kiye
 
 
 He asked 16 questions ranging from farmer suicides to the Adani industry group
 
 
 rahi-sahi kasar banaras se narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav maidan main utarkar puri kar di
 
 
 In this way, he has once again managed to make his place in the media headlines
 
 
 jo narendra modi chandani chowk kii apni chunavi sabha ke baad se hi arvind kejariwal par chup the, unhone chaar maheene baad loksabhaa chunaav ke liye jammu main hui apni pehali sabha main kejariwal par hamalaa kar chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii
 
 
 Calling Kejriwal an agent of Pakistan, he questioned his patriotism
 
 
 shaam ko dilli main bhi kejariwal par unka hamalaa jari rahaa, jahaan sarkaar chhodane ke liye unhone kejariwal ko aade haath liya or congress ke saath santh-ganth kaa aarope lagaaya
 
 
 Similarly, the Gujarat government has issued a 16-page statement in response to Kejriwal's questions, answering every charge in a sequential manner
 
 
 bijepi ke ranneetikaron kaa kahana he ki modi ne kejariwal par sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat nishaanaa saadhaa he
 
 
 For the last two months, Kejriwal's target is not the alleged corruption of Congress, but Modi's alleged development model of Gujarat
 
 
 vah puure desh main gum-ghumkar modi ke khilaaf prachaar kar rahe hai, or gujarat main vikaas ke daavon par sawaal khadey kar rahe hai
 
 
 BJP believes that by doing this, they are helping the Congress itself, because the Congress is facing the charges of corruption and anti-government wave, now that the people have no credibility that people should take his words seriously, that is why Congress has The man has led the party
 
 
 bijepi is aarope ke samarthan main yah daleel bhi detii he ki khud kejariwal modi ke khilaaf chunaav lard rahe hai, lekin amethi main unki party ne rahul gandhi ke khilaaf kumaar vishwaas ke taur par ek kamjor ummidavaar maidan main utaara he or raibareli main sonia gandhi ke khilaaf abhi tak ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 
 
 BJP strategists believe that despite the failure of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, many of the big cities outside Delhi still retain a kind of attraction towards the young and middle class, hence Narendra Modi is attacked by Kejriwal and this class They have to put their 'reality' in front, so that they can easily make up their mind when casting votes
 
 
 modi kii ranneeti kejariwal kii party ko congress kii 'bi' team dikhaane kii bhi he, taaki logon ko yah samajha saken ki kejariwal ko vot dene kaa matlab congress ko hi vot dena he
 
 
 Apparently, Modi, who is competing with Kejriwal in Banaras, is no longer taking his adversary lightly, at least this is clear from his yesterday's attacks
 
 
 lekin dekhnaa hoga ki agar congress banaras main unke khilaaf koi majboot ummidavaar utaarti he, to kya tab bhi modi kejariwal par hi hamalaa karte rahenge, yaa kejariwal par unke hamale sirf banaras tak simit rahenge
 
 
 The lagata he ki chhattisgarh kii bijepi sarkaar aravind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party se kuch zyada hi prabhavit he yaa phir khaufjada
 On the lines of AAP decisions in Delhi, the Chhattisgarh government is also taking similar decisions
 rajya sarkaar viipi culture ke safaaye main bhi jute gai he
 The state government is going to end the system of giving gun salutes to vips under the 'order of President'
 yani 'guard of honor' par puri tarah roak lag jaaegi
 Under this, neither the Governor nor the Chief Minister and Ministers will be given a gun salute on any occasion
 sarkaar ek nayaa notification jald hi jari karne vaali he
 These decisions of Raman government are considered to be the beginning of prevention of VIP culture
 mukhyamantri raman singh ne rajya kii bijepi sarkaar kaa cheharaa-mohara badalane ke liye jor-aajamaaish shuru kar di he
 In this case he has also left behind the AAP government of Delhi
 rajya sarkaar ne bhrashtachar karne waalo ko sabak sikhaane ke liye do toll free number jari kiye hai
 By dialing these numbers, any person can directly file a complaint against the corrupt and those seeking bribe
 ye number he: 0771-4053739 or 0771- xxrep 4 2 410
 Both these numbers can be complained of corruption cases involving the Municipal Corporations, Municipalities and Nagar Panchayats besides the Urban Administration and Development Department
 nagar prashasan vibhaag kaa jimmaa khud mukhyamantri raman singh ke paas he
 Therefore, they will not tolerate any corrupt employees in the departments under them
 nae saal par raman singh ne patr likhakar apane sabhi mantriyon se kaha tha kii ve bhrashtachar ke maamalon se kadai se nipate
 He said that the ministers themselves should work with transparency so that corruption can be curbed
 udhar sarkaar ke in faislon se congress bhi pasopesh main he
 She is neither able to criticize nor oppose these decisions
 haalanki in faislon ko congress sasti lokapriyata hasil karne vaala faisla qaraar de rahi he
 However, these decisions of the Chhattisgarh government have given rise to some expectations in the eyes of the general public
 bihar ke mujffarpur main bacchon kii maut kaa aankada 113 tak pahunch chukaa he
 Within the last 24 hours, 75 new patients have been admitted to the medical college
 418 bacchon kaa ilaaj chal rahaa he, jisamen kai kii haalat gambhir bataai ja rahi he, lekin abhi tak na to sarkaar, na doctor ye tay kar paae hai ki ye beemaari koun si he
 In Muzaffarpur and the surrounding areas it is being called Chamki, but governments probably do not have the time to find the real cause and cure for the disease
 maut kii shuruyaat ke kareeb 20 din baad mangalvaar subah-subah mukhyamantri nitish kumaar mujffarpur ke SKMCH aspataal pahunche
 After Nitish's arrival, the parents of the children hoped that there would be some treatment of the arrow being treated like an arrow in the air with their nuns, they would get medicines, the health of the hospital would improve, but the patience of the people broke due to CM Sahd's tenure
 Gone
 log naare lagaate rahe or nitish aspataal prashasan kii peeth thapthapaakar aaraam se nikal liye
 The case of deaths due to chum fever has reached the Supreme Court
 do vakeelon ne janhit yachika daayar kar maang kii he ki beemaari se prabhavit ilaakon main centre or bihar sarkaar ko 500 isiu banane kaa aadesh diya jaae, prabhavit ilaakon main medical export team bhejne ke nirdesh die jaaen or 100 mobile ICU mujffarpur bheje jaaen
 Along with this, a medical board should be formed
 is bich chamaki bukhaar ke kaaran lagaataar bad rahi mauton kii taadaad ko dekhte hue rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog (enechaarsi) ne somvaar ko kendriya swasthya mantralay or bihar sarkaar se report daakhil karne ko lekar notice jari kiya he
 There are reports that apart from Muzaffarpur, some other districts of the state have also been affected by it
 ayog ne ise lekar report maangi he
 It also asked what kind of treatment is being provided to the hospitalized children and what kind of assistance has been provided to the affected families by the state government
 ayog ne swasthya mantralay or bihar sarkaar se chaar hafton main jawaab dene ko kaha he
 Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has said that there will be no change in the rules for the amount of debt taken by Greece, but the institute will continue to help resolve the problem
 lagaarde ne buudhvaar ko brookings santhaan main kaha, jahaan tak imef kaa sawaal he to meraa maananaa he ki imef ko apane niyamon kaa paalan karnaa he
 We cannot back down from our rules and give special concessions to anyone
 sinhua ne lagaarde ke hawaale se kaha, ham mushkil daur se guzar rahe deshon ko karj dete hai

 Lagarde said at the Brookings Institute on Wednesday, "as far as the IMF is concerned, i believe the IMF has to follow its rules
" ham apane niyamon se peeche nahin hat sakate or kisi ko bhi vishesh riyaayat nahin de sakate
 "we give loans to countries going through difficult times," Xinhua quoted Lagarde as saying
 hamaare dwaara diya gaya karj vibhinn jaruraton ke saath sashart diya jaataa he, lekin inkaa uddeshy sthirataa behaal karnaa, vikaas badhanaa or karj vahniyata hasil karnaa he
 The comments lagaarde ne kaha ki greece ko sudhaaron ke sambandh main do kaam karne chahie
 The first is that the country will have to take significant reformist (financial) steps and reduce the fiscal deficit; second, the debt restructuring
 unhone kaha ki is sankat ko gambhirtha se or tivrata se nipataane kii jarurat he
 Greece has been on the imf's list of defaulters since 1 July

 5 billion euro installments to be paid

 The Arogyakiranam project was launched by the Kerala Health Department in May 2013
 isamen rashtriya bal swasthya kaarykram ke tahat nirdhaarit centre sarkaar se praapt dhanrashi kaa istemaal kar ke logon ko achche swasthya kaa adhikaar dene kaa desh main apni tarah kaa pehla prayaas kiya gaya he
 In this, the responsibility of the health of every person below 18 years has been taken
 unhen cancer, hriday or gurde jaisi tamaam gambhir bimariyon ke muft ilaaj kii suvidha milti he
 It helps about 1

 pichley saal bhar main rajya sarkaar ne mahilaon ko prasav se pehle or baad main swasthya seva or prasav kii suvidha dene tathaa navjaat shishu ko 30 din tak chikitsa sahaayta dene ke liye ammayum kunjam project jaisi kai yojanaayen shuru kii hai
 There is also a special health package for the Attapadi tribal area, in which there were reports of many deaths due to malnutrition in 2013 in this area
 rajya sarkaar ne kaarunya saamudayik dawa kendron ke madhyam se dawaaon kii keemton par ankush lagane kii bhi koshish ko anjaam diya he
 Kerala has also made great progress in key health indicators such as infant mortality and birth rate and life expectancy

 Voting has been done in 222 seats in Karnataka
 ab sabhi ko 15 may ke janadesh kaa intjaar he
 There is a trend of no return of the ruling party in the state, as well as the ruling party at the center has rejected the people of Karnataka in history
 lekin 'ajtak' kaa Exit Poll congress party ke paksh main aata dikh rahaa he
 According to the exit poll, it is almost certain to become the Congress government in the state and it is expected to get 106-118 seats
 vahiin bijepi ko 79-92 seat or jedies ko 22-30 seat milti dikh rahi hai
 This survey has been done on 222 seats in the state and in this the Congress is looking very close to the majority
 muslimon ne congress par barasaaye votsurvey ke mutabik rajya main muslim or SC / ST vot bijepi se dur hota dikh rahaa he
 In the exit poll, Congress is getting 80 percent of the vote of the Muslims of Karnataka
 vahiin anusuchit jati (SC) kaa 42 fisadi vot or anusuchit janajati (ST) kaa 48 fisadi vot paane main congress safal hoti dikh rahi he
 In contrast, BJP has got only 5 percent Muslim vote
 iske alaava 33 fisadi SC vot or 26 fisadi ST vot bijepi ke khaataa main jaataa dikh rahaa he
 JDS +, the third major party in Karnataka, is estimated to get 6 percent Muslim votes
 vahiin jedies 15 fisadi SC vot or 17 fisadi ST vot hasil kar sakati he
 On the other hand, 9–9 percent of Muslim and SC / ST community votes are estimated to be in the account
 jedies kii kamajori kaa phaaydajankaron kii maane to rajya main jedies kaa kamjor hona bijepi se muslim vot chhitakane kii badi vajah ban saktaa he
 Before the elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's praise of JDS chief Deve Gowda and then Congress's call of JDS as bjp's b team also seems to have an effect on this pole
 chunaav se pehle tamaam openian pole congress ko sabase badi party bataa rahe the
 In such a situation, Muslim voters made their mind to go to the Congress's court instead of voting for JDS and for BJP, and according to this math, 80 percent of Muslim voters are seen going to Congress
 dilachasp yah he ki muslim vot paane ke maamle main bijepi kii sthiti jedies se bhi kamjor najar aati he or use sirf 5 fisadi muslim vot milane kaa anumaan he
 BJP away from Dalit votes? The Congress strongly targeted the ruling BJP at the Center by raising issues of Dalit oppression across the country during the election campaign
 yahi vajah he ki pole ke mutabik SC / ST samudaay kaa vot bhi bijepi se chhitakta dikh rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of weakening SC / ST Act from Una in the election rallies in the Karnataka elections and the Congress seems to be benefiting from it
 rajya kii 13 fisadi aabaadi muslim he jabaki anusuchit jati kaa samudaay aabaadi ke anupaat main sabase bada he
 SC accounts for 17 percent of the total population
 vahiin anusuchit janajati kii aabaadi bhi kareeb 7 fisadi he
 In such a situation, going to these communities with the Congress seems to be beneficial for him

 The holy festival of Navratri is starting today
 navaratri ke maukey par deshbhar main log maa durga kii bhakthi main duubate ja rahe hai
 Mother Vaishno Devi also has a huge crowd of devotees in the holy court and with this, a big challenge faced by the security agencies is to provide protection to the devotees of Mother
 bhakton ke liye khul gaye hai mata baishno devi ke dwaar
 Rich and poor, weak and helpless, any mother from any corner of the country will fulfill their wishes
 maa ke dwaar se koi khaali nahin jayega
 Therefore, a crowd of devotees has started gathering to see Maa Baishno Devi
 lekin jaise jaise katra main bhakton kii bheed jute rahi he, suraksha agenciyon kii chintaae bhi bad rahi hai kyonki khufia report he ki aatanki navaratri ke dauraan badi aatanki vaardaat ko anjaam de sakate hai isliye katra main suraksha itani badha di gai he ki parinda bhi par nahin maar saktaa
 If the security arrangements are strong, then the devotees who come to see Maa Vaishno Devi are also happy

 (input agenciyon se) Forgive me that i am calling the 66th Republic Day as 'gun Republic Day', but what to do, it has been more than a decade as we go to the Republic Day celebrations
 har baar talashne kii koshish karata hum ki rajpath kii sarkari chamakadamak main aam aadmi kaa ganatantr kahin dikhe
 At first, the face of the common man was sometimes seen in the corridors on any corner of Rajpath, but this time he could hardly be seen
 haa, har baar se adhik is baar bas gan hi gan jarur dikhengi
 
 
 Better from one another
 
 
 suna he, gan kaa saath dene ke liye videshi dog bhi aae hai
 Republic directly means the system of Gana, that is, the system of the common man, but whether the common man will be seen this time, is anyone's attention on him
 
 
 ? aakhir vah parade dekhne kaise aa paaegaa, kyonki us din rajpath kii ore vahi gaadi ja sakati he, jiske paas parade ke paas honge
 The public metro will be closed several hours before citing security
 ab vah jamaana bhi lad gaya, jab gaanv or dur dehaat se log paidal parade dekhne aate the
 Yes, if you are Prime Minister or with Obama, no one will ask for a pass
 sari vyavastha to isi ko lekar ho rahi he ki obama ko parade dekhne main koi dikkat na ho
 The entire Rajpath has been fortified in the name of security
 aam aadmi ke ja paane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta, kyonki pehle to use dilli kii kadakadaati or haddi jamaa dene vaali thand main subah 6-7 baje tak kai kilometre dur se paidal chalakar rajpath tak aana hoga phir uske paas apana koi na koi pahachaanapatr bhi hona chahie
 Even then, if he is able to reach around Rajpath, then he will be able to stand somewhere at the end of the parade, where he will be able to see what you can see
 vaise, lagata he ki sarkaar bhi rajpath par aamajan kii adhik bhagidaari nahin chaahati, tabhi to na akhbaar main, na tivi channelon par or na hi sarkaar ke philhal sabase priy madhyam radio main, is baat ke ishtihaar die jate hai ki aam aadmi chaahe to isamen shaamil ho saktaa he
 Needless to say that on this Republic Day, the most difficult or troubles are going to be faced by the general public, such as closing the metro several hours in advance, rail, bus and air services to many cities will be closed at that time
 saath hi anya duusari pareshaaniyaan hongi so alag
 The arrival of Obama will increase the value of the country, but the real price will have to be paid by the common man
 jab desh ne pehali baar 1950 main ganatantr diwas manaaya tha, to sahi myne main keval or keval aam janata kii bhagidaari thi
 At that time the system, ie, the system was not isolated, but it seems that, as democracy matured, the system continued to dominate in this festival of Republic and Gana left behind
 varsh 1962 main hue ganatantr diwas samaaroh ke liye pehali baar tikat bikna shuru hua
 By the way, do people celebrate the national festival like Republic Day with as much enthusiasm as festivals like Holi and Diwali
 aaj agar log sadak par nikalen to unhen band raaston, chhavnee bani dilli or dil tod dene vaali pulisia talaashi se itnaa pareshaan kiya jaataa he ki ve is din ghar se nikalnaa hi pasand na karen
 In this annual event on the occasion of Republic Day, where different types of tableaux and artists will spread their colors on Rajpath, the pride of brave children selected from across the country will also be seen
 teenon senaaon or ardhsainik bal ke jawan apni takat, astr-shastron or josh ke jariye ek baar phir vishwaas dilaayenge ki desh unke haathon main surakshit he, lekin afsos, aam janata, jiske liye yah sara tamzam hota he, vahi is sabko dekhne se shaayad maharoom rah jaaegi
 Now it seems that this biggest national festival of the country should not lose its dignity and become a mere official formality
 aane vaali peedi ise televijan yaa internet par hi dekhakar hi santosh na kar le
 But we want that you may not be able to go to Rajpath due to government frills, but wherever there is a chance, celebrate Republic Day openly
 
 
 aakhir yah hamaara, hamaare liye or hamaare dwaara varshon kii gulaami sahane or anginat qurbaaniyaan dene ke baad hasil azaadi ko janatantr main badalane kaa sabase bada parv jo he
 When there were constant reports in the country about who would become a minister, who would not, at the same time, news also started coming that Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal would not join the United Government
 kai tarah ke kayaas lagane lage ki aakhir kya baat ho gai, magar phir yah bhi khabar aane lagi ki nitish kumaar ne pradhanmantri se baat kar apni duvidha saaf kar di he ki unke mantri shapath nahin le sakenge
 It was also discussed that perhaps the department that Nitish Kumar wanted was not being given to him
 baat rail yaa phir krishi mantralay kii hone lagi, magar baad main khud nitish kumaar ne sthiti ko saaf kiya ki unka bijepi ke saath sambandh bana rahegaa, magar unke mantri shapath nahin lenge
 This thing has been conveyed to the BJP president
 jediu kii sarkaar main bhagidaari ko lekar bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or piem narendra modi ne bhi prayaas kiye lekin nitish kumaar nahin maane
 If they remain like that uncle in marriage, then they get angry at the talk
 ve munh phulae rahe or apni party ke kisi ek saansad ko mantri banavaane ke liye taiyaar nahin hue
 There is some dilemma behind it and there is some compulsion too
 aakhir ve koun se kaaran rahe jisane nitish kumaar ko yah kadam uthaane par majaboor kar diya
 The first reason is to give only one cabinet post to JDU
 nitish kumaar kaa kahana tha ki jab akali dal ke paas do saansad hai or unhen ek mantri pad mil rahaa he or ramvilas paswan kii party ke paas chah saansad hai or unhen ek cabinet kaa pad mil rahaa he, to jediu ke paas 16 saansad hai, unhen kis aadhaar par ek hi cabinet mantri pad diya ja rahaa he
 The JDU wanted at least one more independent charge ministry, but that did not materialize
 nitish kumaar ko pradhanmantri kaa bhi phone aayaa tha, magar baat nahin bani
 The reason is simple, if Nitish Kumar had agreed to a cabinet minister and there was a discussion that Ramchandra Prasad Singh would have been made a minister, then a strange situation would have arisen in Bihar for Nitish Kumar
 log yahi kehete ki nitish kumaar ne apni jati, yani kurmi se hi netaa ko mantri bana diya
 Nitish Kumar felt that this could offend the upper caste people of Bihar, so he wanted Lalan Singh, who comes from Bhumihar caste, to be made a minister along with RCP Singh
 taaki ve bihar main jatiyon ke santulan ko banaae rakh saken
 This is the reason why Nitish Kumar did not think it appropriate to get into this mess and kept his party separate from the oath taking
 aane vaale dinon main bihar main vidhansabha ke bhi chunaav hone hai or usko dekhte hue nitish apni ranneeti banane main vyast hai
 Even during the election, Nitish Kumar was uncomfortable on issues like Vande Mataram
 ve vande maataram ke naaron ke dauraan haath uthaane se parhez karte rahe
 He also avoided the media during the entire election campaign
 bihar main bijepi ko bhi yah sthiti raas aati he
 After a landslide victory in this Lok Sabha election, Bihar BJP leaders are now saying that the next election should be fought alone
 yani bijepi main bhi bihar main mukhyamantri banane kaa sapana dekhne vaale netaaon kii kami nahi he
 They feel that the BJP has become so strong in Bihar that it can fight on its own
 is chunaav main bihar main endie ko 53
 25 percent of the votes were received, of which BJP 23
 58 fisadi or jediu ko 21
 Got 8% votes
 is chunaav ke mutabik jediu kaa vot pichhali baar yani 2014 ke mukaable 16
 04 per cent to 21
 8 fisadi ho gaya jabaki bijepi kaa vot 29
 Reduced from 40 percent to 23
 58 fisadi rah gaya
 The same thing is ticking BJP leaders
 kai bijepi netaa nitish kumaar ko andeh kii drushti se dekhte hai kyonki bihar main vipaksh ke log nitish kumaar ko palatu kumaar bhi kehete hai
 Many BJP leaders feel that JDU is moving forward with their support
 ab dekhnaa he ki agle vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi or jediu kya-kya ranneeti apanaati hai
 Not giving special status to the state and not getting the economic package is also an issue in Bihar
 yani bihar kii raajnneeti ko dekhte hue nitish kumaar jo kar rahe hai uske kai gahare rajnatik myne ho sakate hai
 Therefore, look forward to what steps Nitish Babu takes which will keep you startled

 The reason behind sending the Director General of Rashtriya Rifles to Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir is being told that the Director General needs to get in touch with the commander of the Northern Command, the head of all the operations of the state, but the ground gyroper is away from the troops present in Delhi Due to this, many kinds of obstacles arise
 nideshalayon kaa hoga vilyado dashak pehle sainya prashikshan kaman banaai gai thi

 agar ye log eartiarasi mukhyalay main baithte hai to unka behatar istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, Directorate of Information Technology and Directorate of Information Systems are also doing the same thing but the operation of the two is different

 According to sources, 300 officers can be reduced from Delhi only with the reorganization of Army Headquarters
 bal ke punargathan ke pehle charan main 13 lakh kii majboot sena main se 50,000 adhikariyon or javaanon kii katautee kii ja sakati he

 This is much less than the Navy and Air Force

 This means that they spend 65 percent of their allocated amount on salary, equipment maintenance and manpower
 baaki 35 pratishat raashi nai hathiyaar pranaaliyon kii kharid par kharch kii jaati he
 If sources are to be believed, this is not a new idea
 purv ke sena pramukhon ne bhi ise aage badhaane kii koshish kii thi

 He said, the campaign is going on and more details about it are awaited
 unhone bataaya ki maare gaye aatankwaadi kii pahchaan or uske sanghathan ke bare main pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he
 The comments gauratlab he ki ravivaar (18 sitambar) ko seemaa paar se aae chaar pakistani aatankiyon ne army base par hamalaa kar diya tha

 JNU ke chaatro ne di nobel puraskaar par apni pratikriyobhijit banerjee nobel paane vaale JNU ke pehle chaatrabharat ke mashhoor arthshaastri abhijit banerjee ko nobel puraskaar se navaaje jane ke baad puri duniya main desh kaa kad badha he
 At the same time, there is a wave of happiness in every camp at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in the capital Delhi
 is puraskaar ke baad aajtak
 in took the campus response
 zyaadaatar vidhyaarthiyon kaa kahana tha ki unhen ummid he ki is aword se jeenyu ke khilaaf logon ke man main bana nakaaratmak najariya badalegaa
 Abhijeet Banerjee, who studied at JNU, came to the campus in 1981 to study economics
 yahaan padhai ke dauraan sangharsh main shaamil hone ke chalate abhijit banerjee ko 10 dinon ke liye jail bhi janaa padaa tha
 JNU students say that a Nobel Prize to a student among them will be helpful in changing the attitude of the people regarding the recent controversy against the university
 saal 1980 main jeenyu se hindi sahitya main piechdi karne vaale or vartmaan samay main communist party ke mukhpatr lok lahar ke sampadak rajendra sharma ne aajtak
 Talking to in, said that Abhijeet Banerjee getting Nobel Prize is an answer to this government
 rajendra sharma bataate hai ki 1983 main jeenyu main garib or pichhadon ko daakhila aasaani se milane vaale niyamon main badlaav kiye jane ke khilaaf chaatro ne tatkaaleen jeenyu kulapati awaas par 2 dinon ke liye dharna diya tha jiske baad 100 se zyada chaatro ko lagbhag 10 dinon ke liye giraftaar karke tihaad jail bhej diya gaya tha
 Rajendra Sharma says that Abhijeet Banerjee was not associated with any ideology or student organization
 phir bhi wo garib tabake or saamaajik taur par pichde hue logon ke liye uthe us andolan kaa hissaa jarur bane lekin tihaad jail ke 10 dinon kii karawas ke dauraan shaayad unhone saamaajik sachai ko behad kareeb se dekha tha
 Rajendra Sharma says that Abhijeet Banerjee is the first JNU student to get the Nobel, as well as the first prisoner of Tihar who has been awarded the Nobel Prize
 JNU ke khilaaf haalia uthe vivaadon ko lekar jeenyu ke purv chaatr rajendra sharma kehete hai ki ye vivaad failaane waalon ke munh par karaara jawaab he
 Professor Abhijeet Banerjee used to study at jnu's Center for Economics Studies and Planning
 jeenyu kaa ye purana campus ab siaisef ke niyantran main he lekin nai campus kii nai imaarat main maujuuda adhyapakon kaa samooh unke yogadan ko saraahneey maanata he
 Professor Himanshu, a teacher at the same Center for Economic Studies and Planning, says that education and activism has been the culture and tradition of JNU
 yahaan zyada se zyada sochane kii aazaadee milti he
 Abhijeet Banerjee receiving the Nobel Prize is an encouraging news for young students as well as the entire teaching class
 himanshu kehete hai ki jeenyu ko lekar uthe vivaad puri tarah se raajnneetik hai or padhane padhaane vaale log usamen vishwaas nahin karte kyonki jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay kii pratishtha jas kii tas bani hui he or rashtriya ranking main bhi awwal hai
 The reactions given by the students: Abhijeet Banerjee getting the Nobel Prize is the biggest news for JNU students because they feel that no one will raise a finger on students studying at Jawaharlal Nehru University tagged as Anti National
 assam ke rahane vaale kalyaan sonwal jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main media study ke research scollar hai or maanate hai ki jeenyu ke chaatr ko nobel puraskaar milanaa un shaktiyon or sanghathanon ko karaara jawaab he jo jeenyu kii pratishtha kharaab karte hai
 Saloni, a student of JNU based in Delhi, says that student politics is important, it should be encouraged as Abhijeet Banerjee also had to stay in jail for 10 days
 aakhirkaar is vishvavidhyalay main arthshaastri, samajashastri, itihaaskaar samet na jane kitne heere desh ko die hai
 On the tag of sedition following allegations of alleged sloganeering in JNU, Saloni says, "jawaharlal University's contribution to society is commendable and we need many such organizations which are being maligned for anti national actions
" uske andar kaabiliyat hi kaabiliyat he or hamen aisi or sansthaaon kii jarurat he
 "saloni, a research scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University, shares that after the controversy arose he found it difficult to call himself a student of JNU among friends and society because changing people's mindset was a big challenge
 lekin ab saloni ko ummid he ki usee jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay se nikle ek chaatr ko nobel puraskaar milanaa samaaj main is vishvavidhyalay or uske chaatro ke prati logon kaa najariya or ravaiya jarur badalegaa
 Saloni told Aaj Tak that sometimes i had to explain my family to friends and relatives for hours on the whole dispute and tell them that it is nothing but all the controversies are fake but now after this Nobel Prize i hope that their The mindset will definitely change
 pashchim bengal ke purulia se jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay main soshal medicine main emphil karne aae chaatr kowshik mahatv bhi kehete hai ki nobel puraskaar darasal sarkaar ko karaara jawaab he
 Kaushik Mahato expressed his happiness over the Nobel Prize in the conversation, saying that in the last five-six years, Jawaharlal Nehru University was tagged as anti-national
 khud abhijit banerjee bhi vaais chancelar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane ke liye 10 dinon tak jail main the, aaj unako nobel milanaa is sarkaar ko karaara jawaab he chaatr raajnneeti har vishvavidhyalay main mahatvapurn he
 Pramod, who lives in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh and is doing phd in Environmental Science from Jawaharlal Nehru University, says it is a proud opportunity for him too
 lekin unhen vah samay bhi yaad aata he jab jeenyu main uthe narebaaji ke vivaad ke baad unhen apane parivaar or samaaj kaa saamana karne main dikkat hoti thi
 JNU has been continuously contributing to the society ever since it was established but since the appointment of new Vice Chancellors here, there have been many attempts to stop the reputation of JNU
 vivaad uthne ke baad parivaar main or gaanv ke logon ko yah samajhane main dikkat hoti thi kyonki vah hamase poochhate the ki tum jeenyu main padhane gaye ho yaa naare lagane
 Then we used to say come and see what we study here or what we do
 bihar ke madhepura main rahane vaale om bhi jeenyu se adhyayan kar rahe hai
 Om says that JNU is not against the government but against the policies of the government which are not in the interest of society and the country, so it should not be considered anti-government
 om jaise jeenyu ke tamaam chaatr ye maanate hai ki jis vishvavidhyalay par anti-national hone kaa tamgaa laga, jis vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro par desh virdohi hone ke aarope lage or jis vishvavidhyalay ke parisar main desh virdohi naare lagane kaa aarope laga
 Today, after getting the world's highest honor from a student from the same university, not only will the people's mindset change, but the attitude of the people towards JNU will also be positive

 After looking at the speech of President Pranab Mukherjee, the picture of the budget that emerges shows signs of five special things - 1
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ne kaha, 'meri sarkaar ne kar pranali main vyapak kaarykushalta tathaa samya laane ke liye apane prayaason ko teevr kiya he
 Economy is also a high priority of our government in expenditure management

 'hints for the Budget- Hopefully, in the budget proposals, Arun Jaitley will present a blueprint for implementing GST in Parliament

 In recent years, inflation has emerged as the biggest challenge for the government
 is bare main raashtrapati ne kaha, 'mudrasphiti ko rokane se lekar arthvyavastha ko unnat karnaa, nae vichaaron ko badhaava dene se lekar samaveshi vikaas sunishchit karnaa, sahakaari sanghavaad ko badhaava dene se lekar rajyon main swasth pratispardhaa kii bhaavana paidaa karnaa, ek acchhee shuruyaat ho chuki he

 The Rajya Sabha was also adjourned till twelve o'clock shortly after the commencement of the Rajya Sabha meeting due to the ruckus of the opposition members on the demand for a discussion in the House on the incident of the Hyderabad bomb blast

 At the commencement of the House meeting, Speaker Hamid Ansari referred to two bomb blasts in Dilsukhnagar Colony in Hyderabad and strongly condemned it
 is ghatana main maare gaye logon ko sadasyon ne kuch pal maun rah kar shradhanjali di
 After this, the Chairman asked to start the Question Hour, while M
 Venkaiah Naidu of BJP said that he has given a notice to postpone the Question Hour for the purpose of discussing this terrible incident
 sabhapati ne kaha ki kai or sadasyon ne bhi notice die hai or vah swayan chaahate hai ki is par vyapak charchaa ho

 uttar pradesh main 2005 se ab tak chah aatanki hamale hue, tafteesh hui, abhiyukton ke khilaaf aaropapatr daakhil hue lekin adaalat main sunwaayee ke dauraan maamla itnaa kamjor tha ki kai abhiyukt bari kar die gaye
 The police, who made them witnesses, refused to recognize the culprits
 yah sab police kii lachar jaanch, aanan-fanan giraftaar kaa nateeja he
 The police training and staff shortage also contribute less to this
 police kii lachar jaanch kii baangi par gaur kijieh 23 november, 2007 ko lakhanu, faijabad or banaras main adaalat parisar main bam dhamaake main 9 logon kii maut ho gai thi or kaaphi log ghayal hue the
 On December 22, 2007, the 'special Task Force' (STF) arrested Muhammad Khalid Mujahid, resident of Thana Rani Ki Sarai, Azamgarh, and Tariq Kazmi of Madihu, Jaunpur, with heavy explosive material from Barabanki railway station
 estf ko unke duusare saathiyon-sajjadurrahman or mohammad tarik kii bhi jaankaree mili
 He was allegedly arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police and handed over to the STF on 26 December 2007
 in abhiyukton ne lakhanu or faijabad kii adaalaton main visphot kii jimmedaari lee or police adhikariyon ke saamne ikbaalia bayaan ke aadhaar par mukadmaa darj kara diya gaya
 Rajesh Srivastava, the then Jurisdictor of the anti-terrorism Squad (ATS), filed a chargesheet in the court
 aatankiyon ke khilaaf police kaa abhiyojan kitna durust he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki faijabad main hue bam visphot cond kii sunwaayee kar rahe faijabad ke tritiy apper jila evam satr nyaayadhish kii adaalat main ab tak pesh 31 gavaahon main se 30 ne ghatana ke abhiyukton ko pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya he
 The witnesses said that they have never seen the terrorists present in the court
 india today ke paas maujuud adalati karrwai ke dastavejon ke mutabik ek gavaah ne adaalat main maujuud abhiyukt tarik kazmi ko dekhakar kaha ki usee ne hi court parisar main cycle main bam rakhaa tha
 However, that witness's statement also exposed the police negligence in such a serious case
 police ke aaropapatr ke mutabik faijabad adaalat main bam kazmi ne nahin rakhaa tha
 He was present at the court gate and Imran and Tariq Kashmiri placed a bomb in the court premises
 haalanki maamle ko dekh rahe ates ke ek bade adhikari yah maanane ko taiyaar nahin ki adaalat main pesh kiye gaye gavaahon ne aatankiyon ko dekhne kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 The police's complicity in punishing the accused can be gauged from the fact that despite being allowed, the investigating officer of the ATS did not record the confessional statement of the accused under Article 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CRPC)
 yahi nahin, adaalat se ijaajat milane ke baavjood kisi kaa 'laai detector test' nahin hua or na hi inke khilaaf gavaahon ko majboot karne ke liye shinaakht parade hi karai gai
 a senior ATS official argues that the Supreme Court has ordered not to conduct narco test without the consent of the accused
 isi vajah se abhiyukton kaa 'test' nahin karaayaa gaya
 Government lawyers, who have been lobbying for the lax police action against the terrorists in the court, are also facing difficulties
 atirikt jila shaskeey sahaayak adhivaktaa (faujadaari) virendra maury maanate hai, ''yah tay he ki pakade gaye abhiyukton ne hi faijabad court main ghatana ko anjaam diya he lekin police kii tafteesh main kaaphi kamiyaan hai
 The witnesses are not recognizing the accused, which is causing difficulties in lobbying
 ''police kii karrwai se kshubdh maury kehete hai, ''agar aatankiyon ke khilaaf saare sakshya mil bhi jaaen to unhen ek saath jod paanaa sambhav nahin he
 However, there is a ray of hope in this matter
 maury bataate hai ki police ne abhiyukt kazmi ke ghar par chapa markar kuch sahitya or bina sim ke do mobile phone baraamad kiye the
 The IMEI number of the recovered mobile phone revealed that he was in constant conversation with a terrorist from Jammu and Kashmir
 duusari ore, disambar, 2007 main sena ne us aatanki ko maar giraaya or uske paas se mili phone se pataa chalaa ki usne kazmi se kai baar baat kii thi
 Maurya says, "this link is being added to gather evidence against the accused
" aatanki ko maar giraane vaale karnal ko adaalat ne talab kiya he
 "the police become active as soon as the terrorist incident takes place and claims to solve the case at the earliest
" aatankiyon ko dabochne ke pulisia daawey bhi shankaa ke ghere main hai
 STF claims to have caught Kazmi from Barabanki police station on December 22, 2007 with explosive material, while in a court statement, Kazmi says that STF apprehended him on December 12, '07 when he was from Azamgarh Sarai Mir was going
 14 disambar, '07 ko kazmi ke baba ajahar ne azamgarh ke thana rani sahay main taharir di ki unke pote ko kuch log uthaakar le gaye hai
 On the other hand, the accused Khalid Mujahid, who was arrested from Barabanki, also told the court that on December 16, 2007, some people picked him up from Mariahu

 Says Darapuri, "with a view to quickly opening a terrorist incident, the police also misapprehend it
 masalan, vah kuch aise logon ko bataur abhiyukt pesh kar detii he jinhen vah pehle se hi pakad chuki hoti he
 a lot of youths are still missing in Sanjarpur and their families have repeatedly expressed such apprehension
 '' aise banaae gaye abhiyukton ke ikbaalia bayaan ke aadhaar par police ghatana kaa raaj fash kar detii he jabaki uske paas koi saboot nahin hota he
 Darapuri says, "the police do not give a chance to the wrongly caught accused because they are afraid that the accused will not turn away from their statement
" yahi vajah he ki ghatana kholane ke baad to police ko vaahvahee milti he lekin court main uskaa cese kamjor ho jaataa he
 "top police officers are not ready to speak anything on record
" police kii tafteesh main kuch or bhi chhed hai
 The Lucknow blast was minor
 vahaan bam ke tukdon par mili ungaliyon ke nishaan kaa abhiyukton se mail karaayaa gaya par ve kisi abhiyukt kii ungaliyon ke nishaan se mail nahin khaae jabaki faijabad jahaan court main visphot ke baad dhul or dhuen kii vajah se kuch bhi nahin dikh rahaa tha or bam ke tukade-tukade ho gaye the, phir bhi un par mili ungaliyon ke nishaan abhiyukt khaald mujahid or akhtar kii ungaliyon se mail khate mili
 On this, the ATS official argues that some pieces of the bomb were buried under something in Faizabad, due to which the dust did not settle and fingerprints were safe

 Gupta blames the Criminal Justice System for the poor investigation of terrorist incidents and for not recognizing the accused in the court
 ve kehete hai ki kanoonee prakriya main lagane vaale lambey samay ke chalate kai baar gavaah apni baat par date nahin rah pate
 They are scared of the accused, along with the police does not provide any protection to these witnesses
 gupta bataate hai, ''jab tak jajon kii sankhya nahin badhegi, police ko adhikaar dene jaise jaruri kadam nahin uthaae jaaenge, aparaadh nyaay vyavastha majboot nahin hogi
 As a result, legal action will take a long time
 '' abhiyukton kii pairvi kar rahe vakil mohammad shoeb maamle kii sunwaayee fast trek court main karaane kii maang karte hai
 However, it is certain that the activeness and seriousness of the police should be taken in the investigation of terrorist incidents
 yahi vajah he ki abhi tak pradesh main hui ek bhi aatanki ghatana ke doshiyon ko sajaa nahin mil pai he
 The police acquitted those arrested as terrorists due to lack of evidence by the court

 5
 He was awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1993
 6
 The father did not want the son to learn English
 isliye unhen madrase main bhej diya gaya
 Here he learned Arabic and Persian languages
 majaruuh ke pita police department main kaam kiya karte the
 7
 aalim banane ke baad vah lakhanu pahunche
 Learning Unani system of medicine
 phir ek din is asafal hakim kii kismat ne karavat lee
 He recited his Ghazal at a Mushaira in Sultanpur

 Economic slowdown: message of domestic savings, investment decline - Long term problem in the economy The first chapter of Economic Survey 2018-19 has emphasized that a policy focusing on savings and investment should be brought
 iske anusaar, antarrashtriya anubhav yah bataate hai ki arthvyavastha main lagaataar tej badhat jari rakhane ke liye ooncha nivesh or bachat hona bahut jaruri he
 For example, China has also been mainly dependent on 'high savings and investment'
 saal 2017 main in donon kii badhat dar jidipi ke 45 fisadi tak pahunch gai thi, jab china kaa growth rate kuch sanyat tha
 Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar is very fond of food but his first experience of eating Chinese was quite disappointing as he had to return home hungry and thirsty
 tendulkar ko apni maa ke haath kaa khaanaa bahut pasand tha, lekin aisa nau saal ke hone tak hi tha kyonki iske baad unhone pehali baar china ke khaane kaa swaad chakhaa tha
 Chinese food was becoming very popular in Mumbai in the 1980s and after hearing so much about it, his colony friends planned to eat it together
 tendulkar ne ekanai kitabamein is ghatana ko yaad kiya he, ‘ham sabhi ne 10-10 rupe kaa yogadan kiya jo us samay kaaphi paise hote the or main kuch nayaa aajamaane ke liye kaaphi romanchit tha
 However, that evening proved to be quite disappointing as he had to bear the brunt of being the youngest in the group
 tendulkar ne isamen kaha, ‘‘us restaurant main hamane chikan or sweet corn soup order kiya
 We were sitting at the long table and when the soup came to me from the other end, there was little left in it
 group ke bade ladakon ne zyaadaatar soup khatm kar diya tha or ham chhoton ke liye bahut hi kam bachaa tha
 'but it is not all limited here
 tendulkarne kaha, ‘yahi cheez frid rice or chaumin ke saath bhi hui or mujhe donon main se keval do chammach hi khaane ko mili
 The big boys enjoyed our expenses so that i returned home hungry, thirsty
 ’hachet india ne bacchon ke liye ‘chej yor drims’ naam kii kitaab nikaali he jo tendulkar kii aatmakatha ‘plaing it maai ve’ par aadhaarit he
 Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has not been allowed to visit his constituency in Amethi
 prashasan ne tyoharon kaa mauka hone par suraksha vyavastha kaa hawala dete hue unka prastaavit daura radd kar diya he
 Rahul Gandhi's Amethi tour is proposed on 4 October, which is to last till 6 October
 rahul gandhi ke is kaarykram par sthaneey prashasan ne kanoon vyavastha kaa hawala dete hue use aage badhaane kii apil kii he
 The administration said that the reason has been written to the Congress party in this regard, which said, 'dussehra, Muharram and Durga Puja programs are to be held till October 5 in many places in the district
 jiske chalate jile kii adhiktar police kanoon or suraksha vyavastha main vyast he'
 The letter says that the police force will be busy till October 5, in such a situation it will be very inconvenient to maintain law and order during Rahul Gandhi's program
 prashasan ne ye kaaran bataate hue rahul gandhi kaa kaarykram aage badhaane kii apil kii he
 Congress has accused of conspiracy and Congress has termed this move of administration as a conspiracy
 congress pravaktaa akhilesh pratap singh kaa kahana he, 'bijepi rahul gandhi se ghabraati he
 BJP government does not want Rahul Gandhi to come to UP and visit his parliamentary constituency before Amit Shah's visit '
 akhilesh pratap ne kaha ki dashahra or muharram ravivaar ko khatm ho gaya he
 In such a situation, it is clear that the Yogi government does not want to let Rahul go to Amethi before Amit Shah's visit
 bataa den bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah 10 oktober ko amethi main rahenge
 His program has been approved by the administration
 rahul gandhi ke daftar ke sutron kaa daawa he ki prashasan rajnatik kaarnon se rahul ke daure ko taalna chahta he
 So that Rahul cannot visit Amethi before Amit Shah's tour
 isliye prashasan kii naamanzoori ke baavjood rahul gandhi kaa amethi daura tayshuda tarikhon par hi hoga yani rahul apane daure main philhal badlaav nahin karenge

 ' yah november 1996 ke baad pehla avasar he jabaki tendulkar, rahul dravid, vivies lakshmana or saurav ganguli main se koi bhi bhartiya ballebaaji kram main shaamil nahin he
 India lost all the matches in the last two series in England and Australia, though they continued to win on home soil
 dhoni ne kaha, 'prayek shrunkhlaa nai shuruyaat hoti he
 yourself 
 yah paristhitiyon se talmail bithaana or team kii jarurat ke hisaab se khelnaa he
 There are many young players in the team who will get a chance to play competitive cricket at the Test level
 isliye yah hamaare liye bahut bada sakaaratmak pahalu he
 ' dhoni ne kaha, 'benoni main ham pehle din ballebaaji kar sakate the or virdohi team ko geeli outfield par kshetrarakshan ke liye kah sakate the
 But it is not right to do so as they are also in first class session
 koi bhi chotil nahin hona chahta isliye yah donon tiimon ke liye acha rahaa ki match radd kar diya gaya
 We practiced on the wicket and tried to make the most of it
 ' Talking about the poor performance in the one-day series, Dhoni said he did not get a chance to return due to being a smaller series
 unhone kaha, 'van-de shrunkhlaa main bhi ham achche pradarshan ke prati aashwast the, lekin pehle donon match main hamane kai shaat khele or aksar gend kshetrarakshak ke paas gai
 It's disappointing, but in a small series you don't have a chance to return
 ' Dhoni said, 'but we got to learn a lot from that series
 jaise ki gend kahaan pich karaani he or ballebaaji karte samay koun si gend chhodani he
 So overall our preparations are good and now only different players have to play according to the circumstances
 ' The Indian captain said about the wicket of Wanders, 'the wicket here will definitely help the fast bowlers in the beginning
 gendbaajon ne yahaan acchhee length pakad lee he kyonki unhone yahaan van-de match khelaa tha
 Therefore it is important to bowl better than the new ball
 shuru main wicket milane se madhyakram par dabaav banaaya ja saktaa he
 ' dhoni ne antim ekadash ke bare main nahin bataaya, lekin sanket die ki unke do gendbaaj mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaayenge
 He said, 'our middle-order batsmen have done well in domestic cricket and whenever they got a chance to play internationally
 yah unke liye nayi chunauti he or unhen ab bharat ke baahar test cricket khilne kaa bahut adhik anubhav milegaa
 ' dhoni ko ummid he ki anbhavi jahir khan gendbaaji kii aguwai karne ke alaava yuva tej gendbaajon ko bhi sikh denge
 He said, 'zaheer has a lot of experience
 iske saath hi vah gendbaaji kii aguwai karte hue yuva gendbaajon ke liye guide kaa kaam bhi karenge
 Ashwin's role will also be important as he will not get help like the subcontinent here
 vah pehali pari main jis tarah se gendbaaji karenge vah yahaan duusari pari main gendbaaji karne se bhinn hoga
 ' dhoni ne ballebaaji ke bare main kaha, 'jab senior team kaa hissaa the to ham taiyaariyon ko lekar zyada chintit nahin rahete the kyonki lambey samay tak antarrashtriya cricket khilne se aap apane khel or vibhinn paristhitiyon main khelnaa jaanate ho
 ' unhone kaha, 'unhone (sachin, rahul, lakshmana) ne england, dakshin africa, australia or newjiland kaa kai baar daura kiya he isliye unki mul taiyaariyaan puri rahati thi
 But young players also have to tell what they need to do and which departments need improvement

 bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan ne vahaan aisa koi pramaan nahin paaya he jisaki vajah se sitamarhi ko sita kii janmasthali mana jaae
 Mahesh Sharma was answering the question of Madhya Pradesh BJP MP Prabhat Jha

 Politics is also a strange thing that BJP does the politics of the temple, it is on the backfoot regarding the birthplace of Sita Mata
 vahiin jo janata dal you bijepi ko mandir kii raajnneeti kar sampradayikta failaane kaa aarope lagaati thi wo aaj mata sita ke janm sthaan ko lekar padayatra kar rahi he
 Former MP Arjun Rai has started a padyatra from Majhauli in Muzaffarpur to Chorout of Sitamarhi with thousands of people involved in this padyatra

 The former MP said that the BJP contests elections in the name of Ram and does politics while the BJP ministers are insulting Mata Sita
 pradhanmantri kii upasthiti main unhone mata sita ke janmasthan ko lekar kaha ki sita kaa janm kaha hua tha ye koi nishchit nahin he
 The former MP said that this campaign will continue till Union Minister Mahesh Sharma is dismissed

 inputah bhashaa Teaching poor children An example of how big schools pass exasperated was seen in the Supreme Court on Friday
 supreme court ke aadesh ke baad jin 13 bacchon ko lakhanu ke mashhoor city montesri skool ne admician diya tha un bacchon ko skool ab apane yahaan padhaane se kataraa rahaa he
 The school told the Supreme Court that there are more schools in Lucknow which are closer to the children's home, where these children can be sent
 is par supreme court ne talkh andaaj main kaha 'bachche footbal nahin he ki idhar se udhar phenke jaaain
 'under the Right to Education Act, there is a rule to give 25 per cent seats to poor children in government, non-government and private schools
 lekin pratishthit or manhage skool main shaamil city montesri skool ne garib bacchon ko ye kehete hue admician se inkaar kar diya ki lakhanu main kai or skool hai jahaan bacchon ke daakhile ho sakate hai phir montesri skool hi kyon
 But a few months ago, the Supreme Court ordered that Montessori schools admit and teach 13 poor children
 is aadesh ke baad skool ne admician to de diya lekin skool, supreme court pahunch gaya
 On behalf of the school, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued before the court that there are many more schools in Lucknow which are near the homes of these poor children
 isliye in bacchon ko un skulon main shift kiya ja saktaa he
 However, in the meantime, UP government lawyer m Shamshad clearly stated that children should not be dropped out of school
 upi sarkaar ne bacchon komontesri schulmen hi rakhane kaa nirnay liya he
 Angered by the attitude of the school, the court said that 'children are not football who should be thrown here and there
 ' court ne skool or upi sarkaar donon ko likhit jawaab dene ko kaha he
 RJ Syama are vahi radio mirchi kii mashhoor radio jocky jo ham sab ke liye radio mirchi par kai shoj lekar aati hai
 Like old jeans, what happened then, the Manto series, a page from my diary
 puraani genes main to wo hamen puraane-puraane melody gane sunaati hai
 And shares a lot of things with us
 unke saath ek badi hi mjedaar baat ye he ki wo ek sahitya-premi bhi hai
 Literature is coming up to date on November 12-13
 to hamane unka intervyuu kar liya:1
 Who is your favorite writer? My favorite writer is Sahadat Hasan Manto
 radio mirchi par maine manto kii kahaniyon kii ek siries bhi chalaai thi
 Which was Radio's first ever 'manto Series'
 jise logon ne kaaphi pasand kiya
 Sahadat Hasan Manto first read his stories on the radio
 ye unhone partishan se bhi pehle kiya tha
 At that time, only All India Radiohua used to do it
 isi tarah maine bhi manto kii kahaniyon ko radio mirchi par pard kar sunai
 Every Friday night we used to bring stories of Manto
 manto kii jo khaas baat thi ki wo bebaak andaaj main likhte the
 Many writers are not able to write so flawlessly
 manto mere liye sirf ek lekhak nahin hai
 He is a work for me
 manto kii ek kahani he jo mere jehan se kabhi nahin nikalati he
 The name of that story is 'open it'
 ‘khol do’ padhate hi mujhe nirbhaya or har din jitani nirbhaya hindustan main or puri duniya main banati hai, meri najar ke saamne khadi ho jaati hai
 Then it seems that time has passed but the situation is the same

 Your regular show comes 'old Jeans' on Radio Mirchi
 jisamen aap logon ko puraane gane sunaati hai
 So what are the songwriters whose compositions you like? i like Shailendra very much among the lyricists
 sahir ludhiaanvi bahut achche lagate hai
 i love Neeraj's songs and poems
 or aaj ke geetkaaron main mujhe irshaad kamil, amitabh bhattacharya, javed akhtar, gulzaar bahut achche lagate hai
 The words of his songs are very beautiful
 12-13 ko dilli main lagegaa sahitya ke sitaron kaa mahakumbh, dekhen puraa shedul3
 Who do you read among today's Hindi writers? If i talk about today's Hindi writers, i like the stories Gulzar has written
 baaki mujhe lagata he ki jo thode pehle vaale jenereshan ke hindi riters the, unki riting zyada acchhee thi
 i love Gulzar's book "ravi Paar"
 jo ki ek maa or bachche kii kahani he
 There is a tragedy of partition in the book Ravi Paar, in which a mother is sitting on top of a train carrying her twins
 ek baccha thand kii vajah se mar jaataa he
 The people who are asked to make excuses in the river Ravi and she shed it
 thikaane par pahunchane par pataa chalata he ki zindaa baccha jo so rahaa tha use baha diya or mara hua usase chipka rah gaya
 The rest is a good book, you should also read it

 If we talk about literature, when it comes to writing, what have you written so far? See, i do not write stories
 par main diary jarur likhti hum
 Which i narrate daily in my show
 mere sho main ek segment bhi aata he “meri diary kaa ek pej” ke naam se
 And what I've just done is "one page of my diary"
 use aap mere fasebuk pej par jaakar dekh sakate hai
 Whose lines are like this: Literature Aaj Tak: Tomorrow's pen veterans will gather in Delhi on November 12-13, know how to register "my Today page"
 pej kaa rang white, safed
 What has happened to us, why have we become so judgmental and critical, why is it bad if someone is not like us
 kyon uski soch agar hamase alag he to wo kam buddhi kaa he
 Why if he says something different then he says it wrong
 kyon wo kisi or ko chahta he to wo nakli he
 Why he is with someone else in his thinking is against us
 bhul gaye hai ham shaayad ki khuda ne har shaks ko hamase alag banaaya he
 He is different from us in every way
 kabhi-kabhi ham usamen khud ko paa sakate hai or ham main wo shaayad khud kii chhavi dekh saktaa he
 But this much
 
 is that all
 
 Sometimes he can become our mirror, but remember that mirror is not a slave of the front
 us aaine ke paar ek or jahaan he
 Where Ik and the world reside
 shaayad us aaine ke paar dekhnaa bhul gaye hai ham

 Not only this, history was created in another way

 Ajinkya Rahane also capitalized on the occasion

 Hence an innings played that secured his place in the playing eleven for the further odis

 This time in return, Virat gifted South Africa with his 33rd century
 ek pal ke liye bhi viraat or rahane ne dakshin africa ko match main waapas aane hi nahin diya
 There is a defeat and there is an outcry
 dakshin africa team ke liye ye haahaakaar hi he

 Local Dalit leader and BDS secretary Dinesh Makwana said, “dalits from all over the state are deeply saddened by the Una incident
 yah dikhaata he ki hamase abhi bhi bhedbhaav or jati, dharm or peshey ke naam par vibhinn atyaachaar hote hai
 Therefore many Dalits from Banaskantha have expressed their desire to adopt Buddhism
 'tippaniyan He said, 'during the last three days thousands of Dalits took part in protest rallies here

 car nirmaataaon ko lubhaane ke makasad se bajet main electric vaahanon par jiesti ko 12 pratishat se ghataakar 5 pratishat karne kaa elaan or sambhavit kharidaaron ke liye electric vaahan kii kharid par iskar main katautee kii ghoshnaa se na to nirmaataa or na hi kharidaar bahut utsahit hone vaale hai
 To achieve the government's goals of 2030, electric vehicles will have to be launched on a large scale and given the huge investment required for this, the car industry is inadequate to hang on to the car industry
 sarkaar ne sadakon par daudti kaaron ke lagbhag ek-tihaai ko electric kaaron main badalane kii jo mahatvakanksha paal rakhi he, use chota-motaa lakshya to nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In the same way, the promise to cut taxes will not entice buyers
 dijal / petrol gadipoon kii tulana main electric gadibhan doguni mahangi hai
 For example, in the UK, the electric Hyundai Kona is 75 percent more expensive than its turbo-charged petrol engine, which has a state-of-the-art dual-clutch, automatic gearbox
 isliye bharat jaise keemton ke lihaaj se samvedansheel bazaar main i-kaaron ko vikalp banane ke liye bahut kuch karnaa hoga
 There have been a variety of incentives to increase the trend of people in electric cars in developed economies
 acchhee khaasi shuruaati sabsidi se lekar kaaphi kam beemaa shulk or panjikaran daren; bheed ke ghanton ke dauraan electric gadipoon ke liye exclusive len kii suvidha; free rigerdv parking spot; riyayati daron par bijli; saarvajanik sthanon par muft charging vyavastha; or toll sadakon kaa muft upyog jaise lubhaavne ofer die jate hai
 For example, the price of a good electric car in Norway equals that of a hatchback car of the same size, despite the added benefit of all annual road taxes, public parking fees, tolls and the exemption of using bus lanes
 yahaan tak ki agar praarambhik mulya baadha ko kam bhi kar diya jaataa he or isaki keemten petrol vaahan ke aasapaas aa jaati hai to bhi, in kaaron ko charge karne ke buniyadi dhaanche ke ghanatv or uske vistaar ko lekar kharidaar 'ashankit' rahenge
 The slow progress of building this infrastructure is still a matter of concern
 sadak par vyaktigat / saarvajanik yatayaat ke maujuuda buniyadi dhaanche ko vyaavhaarik rup main sakasham banane main lagbhag ek sadi kaa samay laga he
 One-third of that traffic can be diverted in a decade only when its parallel infrastructure is developed and requires a larger approach, larger practical plans, policy incentives and business models
 isaki ek anya chunauti ko samajhane ke liye is tathy par vichaar karen: ek paaramparik dijal / petrol car kaa tanks phul karne main paanch minute lagate hai, ek sienji vaahan kii tank puri bharne main 10 minute lagate hai jabaki ek electric car ko charge karne main kam se kam 30 minute lagate hai
 Now imagine how many charging stations would be required
 50 kilowat ke disi charging point ke liye vishesh infrastractor kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Even the families who will have charging points available in the parking lot are hardly able to charge the entire night
 menuphaccharing ke drushtikon se dekha jaae to electric car kii sabase badi laagat iske bydaree pack kii hogi
 Tesla built its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada primarily to meet its internal demand for battery packs; Panasonic, which has a partnership with Tesla to manufacture batteries, has 1 in Gigafactory
 6 arab dollar ke shuruaati nivesh kii ghoshnaa kii or lakshya badhata gaya to usne gigafactory main nivesh ke liye $3
 Issued bonds worth $ 86 billion
 philhal, bharat main bydaree-pack nirmaataa nahin hai; pehali company jo maaruti sujuki ko bydaree kii aapurti karegi use bhi apana purna utpaadan shuru karne main abhi kuch saal or lagenge
 Who will set up Gigafactory in India? Will it be one of the country's public undertakings or could it be a Korean giant? Before this, the government will have to prepare a clear roadmap for electric vehicles
 isane apane lakshya apni ichha se taiyaar kar liye hai
 Not only is the automotive industry shrinking, but manufacturers and fuel companies have recently made major investments to adopt stricter emissions and safety norms
 unke liye philhal electric vaahanon kii ore janaa shaayad hi sambhav ho sake

 Modi is currently on a five-day US visit and the two top leaders have decided to write an editorial article together
 yah lekh buudhvaar ko ek america akhbaar main prakashit kiya jayega
 a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Prime Minister Modi and President Obama jointly wrote an editorial in an American newspaper
 yah lekh buudhvaar ko prakashit hoga
 However, officials on both sides are exercising considerable secrecy regarding this article
 unhone us akhbaar kaa naam bhi nahin bataaya, jisamen yah prakashit hoga
 The spokesman said that both Narendra Modi and Obama are advocates of digital diplomacy

 The article has been finalized after the Prime Minister arrives in Washington

 In the rape case, a Delhi court has imposed another section of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (POCSO act) on Kuldeep Singh Sengar

 Under this section, there is a provision of punishment of up to 10 years if found guilty
 nai dhara ko kuldeep singh senger par pehle se lagi POCSO kii dhara 6 ke saath milakar dekha jayega

 This statue was blown up by dynamite in 2007 by the Taliban on the lines of Afghanistan's Bamiyan Buddha
 hinsa ke aghat se prabhavit is ilaake main sahansheeltaa kii misaal kaayam karte hue is pratimaa ko dobaaraa behaal kar liya gaya he
 The Swat Valley of Pakistan remained under Taliban occupation for many years
 is dauraan unhone is ilaake kii aitihaasik pahchaan or samskruti ko tahas nahas karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 This hurt people like Parvesh Shaheen, an expert in Buddhism in Swat
 ek samachar agency se baatcheet ko dauraan parvesh hashmi kehete hai ki aisa laga jaise unhone mere pita, meri samskruti or itihaas par hamalaa kiya
 The area is now being preserved with the help of archeological experts from Italy
 20 feet oonchi is pratimaa ko lagbhag ek dashak pehle charampanthiyon ne iske upar tak chadh kar visphotak saamagree lagaai
 Causing damage to the upper part of the Buddha's face, while another statue near it was torn to pieces
 shaheen ke mutabik yah pratimaa shanti, prem or bhaichaare kaa pratik he
 We do not hate any person, any religion
 kisi se nafrat karnaa bevakoofi se zyada kuch nahin
 But other locals of the Swat Valley who are not familiar with the history and brutality of the Taliban express their happiness over the 2007 incident and argue that the statue is anti-islam
 ise padhein: pakistan main khudaai ke dauraan nikali buddha kii 1700 saal puraani murtypane padosi afghanistan ke jaise hi pakistani taliban charampanthiyon ne puri aabaadi ko kattarpanthi islam se aatankit kiya
 He banned all the replicas of the art of the past in the Swat Valley, calling it un-islamic

 This area has been a pilgrimage for those who believe in Buddha for centuries
 buddha dharm kii vajrayan shakha ke liye yah pavitra sthal rahaa he, jahaan se unki aasthaa kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Vajrayana Buddhists continued to visit this area till the 20th century but after the partition of India in 1947, the border was pulled and it became difficult for them to come here
 swat ghati main 10veen sadi ke aasapaas buddha dharm khatm ho gaya
 He was replaced by Hinduism and Islam
 yah kshetra duusari se chauthi sadi tak buddha dharm ke liye swarnakaal mana jaataa he
 Then there were more than a thousand Buddhist monasteries and stupas in this valley
 is pratimaa ko puri tarah behaal karnaa aasaan kaary nahin tha
 Started in 2012, the work was completed in several phases
 puraani tasveeron or thridi takanic kii madad se is kaam ko anjaam diya gaya
 This repair work was completed in 2016
 italy ke puraatatv visheshgy kehete hai ki yah pratimaa bilkul pehle jaisi to nahin dikhti, lekin aisa jaanboojh kar kiya gaya he, taaki pataa chale ki ise kabhi nuksaan pahunchane kii koshish kii gai thi
 The Italian government invested 2
5 million euros within five years to preserve the cultural heritage of the Swat Valley
 is kaam main sthaneey logon ne bhi madad kii
 People hope that this will increase the chances of tourism in the area
 swat ghati se taliban ke baahar kiye jane ke baad halaat main bahut sudhaar aayaa he
 Domestic tourists have also started going there
 lekin isi saal farvari main ek charampanthi hamale main 11 sainikon kii maut bataati hai ki khatra abhi puri tarah tala nahin he
 Many people in Swat believe that the Buddha will help increase religious tolerance
 patrkaar fazal khalik kehete hai ki shiksha or soshal media ke kaaran saanskrithik viraasat ke liye maujuud khatre kam hue hai
 a museum has also been built in Mingora where historical heritage of the area is decorated

 Recently, the Planning Commission team, which came to Bundelkhand on a two-day visit to investigate the work done under the package money, saw only partial deficiencies, and Union Minister of State for Rural Development Pradeep Jain Aditya was agitated

 On May 14, on the eve of the Kokarnataka election results, the mood of the activists was very different
 kuch kah rahe the ki party 130 siton ke saath sarkaar banaaegi to kuch 120 siton kii baat kar rahe the
 Even pessimists were saying that BJP will emerge as the largest party in the state
 agle din hua bhi kuch aisa hi
 The BJP was undoubtedly the largest party in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly but lost a few steps from securing majority
 bas aath siton se bahumat se chukne vaali bhaajapa kii yah badakismati hi kahi jaaegi ki vah aath siton par 2,500 se bhi kam voton ke antar se haari he
 On the other hand, Congress's tally dropped from 122 seats to 78
 donon partiyon ke bich is chunaav ke antar ko thodaa vistaar se samajhen to congress kaa vot pratishat bhaajapa se kuch adhik hi rahaa he
 Where BJP 36
 2 pratishat vot mili to congress ne 37
 Received 9 percent of the vote
 lekin jamini str par behatar chunavi mashinari or party adhyaksh amit shah tathaa unki team ke behatar chunavi prabandhan ke boote party jahaan 104 siten jeet gai vahiin zyada mat pratishat hasil karke bhi congress 78 par hi simat gai
 Of course, the atmosphere against the ruling Congress government helped the BJP to gain an edge
 phir bhi yah kahana hi hoga ki pradhanmantri narendra modi or shah kii taqatvar jodi kaa kamaal he ki party kii jholii main desh ke 21wein rajya kii satta bhi aa giri he
 However, the Congress is now reduced to just two states and one union territory

 It will be governed in areas with 4 percent population
 vahiin congress maatr 2
 5 percent of the population will be ruling in the areas, which the Trinamool Congress (7

 76 percent) and Biju Janata Dal (3

 As the Union Human Resource Development Minister and BJP in-charge of Karnataka elections, Prakash Javadekar says, "the victory of Karnataka shows how our Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah made an efficient strategy by deeply understanding the election scenario of the state
 And wrested power from the hands of the opposition Congress
 ''pradesh ke sah-prabharee or kendriya railway mantri piyush goyal isamen aage jodate hai, ''amit bhai ne vyapak or kareebi donon hi str par shandaar ranneetiyaan banaain or pradhanmantri kii chhavi ko voton main tabdeel karne kii disha main unhone asaadhaaran mehnat kii
 As a result, we have emerged as the largest party
 ''dohare prayassambhav he, isamen kuch atishyokti ho magar desh ke sabase kushal chunavi ranneetikaar ke rup main shah kii pratishtha karnataka kii jeet ke baad or badaae hi vaali he

 His energy and sharp eye remained in the last eleven days when he planned to visit the Prime Minister
 chah dinon main pradesh ke sabhi mahatvapurn hisson ko cover karti pradhanmantri kii 21 reliyaan rakhi gai thim
 In the remaining four days of election campaign, Shah addressed the Prime Minister through the Narendra Modi app on his smartphone for lakhs of workers of various branches of Karnataka BJP
 bhaajapa kii in shakhaon main yuva morcha, mahila morcha, kisaan morcha, anusuchit jati va janajati morcha or anya kai thim, jise pradhanmantri ne app ke jariye sambodhit kiya
 In his address, the Prime Minister addressed and praised party loyalists from every section of Karnataka
 unke bhaashanon ko sthaneey tivi channelon ne bhi baar-baar dikhaaya
 In this way, even on the last day of campaigning, only Narendra Modi dominated
 bhaajapa ke ity cell ke pramukh amit malviya kehete hai, ''takanic kaa yah abhootpurv prayog tha
 In fact, the party provided smartphones to the workers who did not have smartphones, so that they too could join the party's innovative experiment to connect with the workers

 Whereas in his address to party workers, he took a completely different approach and focused on familiarizing him with the government's efforts
 jaise sarkaar garibon ke liye kya soch rahi he, kya kar rahi he, kaise centre main bhaajapa desh ke saamne khadi do sabase badi samasyaon bhrashtachar or garibi ko khatm karne ke liye prashasnic vyavastha main kis tarah sudhaar kar rahi he
 Modi in his typical style told the workers that the corrupt, whether small or big restless, has been running around here and there
 shah ne congress or siddharamaiya kii kamajoriyon ko aadhaar banaakar or bhaajapa kii takat ke anuroop acchhee chunavi ranneeti taiyaar kii
 The Hindutva card was played neatly as Karnataka has a unique caste equation, dominated by Dalits, Lingayats and Vokkaliga communities
 shah chunaav prachaar ke dauraan 33 hindu mathon main gaye jisamen se kuch daliton ke math bhi the
 Karnataka also has a significant number of followers of the Nath sect
