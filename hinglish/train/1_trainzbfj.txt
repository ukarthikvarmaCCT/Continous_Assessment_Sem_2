 Indian superstar cricketers must accept the majority verdict and accept the DRS
 greg ne kaha, test cricket ke prati bharat ke pakshpatpurna ravaiye or kuch khaas masalon par uske rukh, isisi bhrashtachar jaanch ko lekar ravaiye, doping nirodhak niyamon ko lagu karne kii shighrata par udasin ravaiye, ipel par bhrashtachar ke kathith saaye or australia ke purv pradhanmantri jon harvard ko isisi kaa upaadhyaksh banane se rokane kii prakriya ke abhaav main isaki bhoomika kuch udhaaharan hai
 Greg also accused the BCCI of grabbing their votes in ICC meetings by threatening smaller countries
 unhone kaha, cricket par bisisiai kaa niyantran adhik he, kyonki iske paas isisi kii baithkon main kisi bhi prastaav kaa virodh karne ke liye paryaapt vot hote hai
 The reason for this is that the survival of some countries cannot go on without financial help from India
 greg ne kaha, isisi kii kai samasyayen sulajh jaaengi, yadi bharat sweekaar kar le ki karodon dollar kamaane or cricketron ko dhankuber banane se adhik mahatvapurn cricket kii bhaavana he
 He also slammed the BCCI for not accepting DRS
 tippaniyan He said, this is not good for the game, when there are bad decisions in the media pleas that have affected the outcome of the game
 diares sau fisadi durust nahin he, lekin isse ampiron ke faislon kii kamiyon ko dur kiya ja saktaa he
 Greg said, India has two reasons to reject it

 Indian superstar cricketers must accept the majority verdict and accept the DRS
 greg ne bisisiai par chote deshon ko dhamkaakar isisi kii baithkon main unke vot hathiyaane kaa bhi aarope lagaaya
 He said, the BCCI has more control over cricket, as it has enough votes to oppose any resolution in ICC meetings
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki kuch deshon kaa guzaara bharat se milane vaali aarthik sahaayta ke bina nahin chal saktaa
 "many problems of the ICC will be solved if India accepts that cricket is more important than earning crores of dollars and making cricketers richer," Greg said
 unhone diares sweekaar nahin karne ke liye bhi bisisiai ko aade haathon liya
 The comments unhone kaha, yah khel ke liye acha nahin he, jab media kii sukhiryon main kharaab faisle hon, jinase khel ke nattejey par asar padaa ho
 DRS is not 100 per cent correct, but it can overcome the shortcomings of umpires' decisions
 greg ne kaha, ise thukaraane ke bharat ke paas do kaaran hai
 The first is that its superstars did not have a good experience with DRS in the initial days and secondly BCCI believes that this is not entirely correct
 bhartiya superstar cricketron ko chahie ki bahumat ke faisle ko maane or diares ko sweekaar karen

 One life, which most of the youth of the world imagine, topped it is the job of an officer in the army
 saare noujvaan kabhi-na-kabhi unke desh kii seva karne ke liye sena kaa hissaa hona chaahate hai
 a job with dedication, service and respect
 jiske jaisaa kuch or nahin hota
 National Security Academy (NDA) is the first step in our country to be an army officer
 isamen daakhile ke liye tay umr seemaa he 16 saal 6 maheene se lekar 19 saal
 Until most of the youth of the country cannot think about whether they can read science or B
 tech karen
 By then, the young man who reached the NDA has become an officer
 isi ke maddenjar ham khaas aapke liye laae hai mahatvapurn salaah va jaankariyaan jinhen dhyaan main rakhte hue aap machhlee kii aankh (NDA) rupi lakshya ko safaltaapurvak bedh sakate hai
 Written exam
 
 
 NDA kii likhit pariksha main do papers hote hai
 First Maths (300 Numbers) and Second General Ability Test (600 Numbers)
 isamen ummidavaaron ko alag-alag paper solve karne ke liye dhai ghante kaa samay diya jaataa he
 All questions are objective
 maths ke saare sawaalon ko solve karne ke liye aap ncertki kitabon ko dhyanpurvak padhate rahenge to kaaphi sahuuliyat ho jaaegi
 Apart from this, it would be easy to solve maths paper if you have RD Sharma's book
 general ability test main acha parform karne ke liye NCERT kii kitabon kagahan adhyayankarna hoga

 They believe that the NDA chooses its officers themselves and not the people who choose the NDA
 is intervyuu kam pariksha main ummidavaaron ko sena va NDA dwaara chaynit jagah par pehle-pahal screening orgrup disctionase hokar guzarana padataa he
 The candidates who succeed in this are kept here for 5 to 6 days
 is dauraan yahaan intervyuu, conference, cmand task or shaareerik kshamta ko bhi jaancha-parkhaa jaataa he
 Overall, SSB is a filtering process and instead of taking the candidates, the candidates are more shortlisted
 saaf-saaf shabdon main kahen to SSB tamaam candidats ke bich se saahabon ko chunane kii prakriya he
 Medical examination is done after SSB
 
 
 ab tak to aap jaan hi gaye honge ki NDA kaa hissaa hona bharat ke sabase gahan or mushkil baton main se ek he
 For this you need to be physically and mentally active
 is puure salaah or jaankaree ke ant main ek baat kaa or dhyaan rakhen ki NDA main daakhil hona dimag se adhik dil kaa maamla he
 And if the heart beats for the country, then the stars are desperate to shine on your shoulders

 National Minorities Commission Chairman Wajahat Habibullah has defended Narendra Modi's recent controversy over his statement of being a 'hindu nationalist', saying the Gujarat Chief Minister should be given the 'benefit of doubt' in the matter
 habibulla ne ek saakshaatkaar main ‘hindu rashtravaadi’ vaale modi ke bayaan par kaha, ‘‘mere khyal se modi ji kii angreji utani acchhee nahin he, unki hindi acchhee he
 Perhaps this is why there was a mistake in the use of words

 '' unhone haalanki ‘hindu rashtravaadi’ ko ‘hindu raashtra’ kii pariklpana se jodate hue kaha, ‘‘dekhie, yahaan angreji kii baat he
 The two words are 'hindu and Nationalist' (hindu and Nationalist) and 'hindu Nationalist' (hindu Nationalist)
 jab muslim rashtravaadi kii baat karte hai to iskaa matlab ‘muslim raashtra’ se hota he
 Similarly Hindu nationalist means 'hindu Rashtra'
 vaise is bare main modi se poocha janaa chahie
 '' pichley dinon samachar agency ‘royatres’ ko die saakshaatkaar main gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne ‘hindu rashtravaadi’ hone ko lekar puche gaye ek sawaal par kaha tha, ‘main rashtravaadi hum
 i am a patriot
 main hindu ke rup main paidaa hua hum
 Therefore you can say that i am a Hindu nationalist
 ’ unke is bayaan ko lekar virdohi dalon or buddhijiviyon ke ek dhade ne unki jamkar aalochana kii

 a post shared by Neha Kakkar (@nehakakkar) on Jul 11, 2018 at 11:54pm PDT The biggest victory for the BJP in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi was as big a defeat for the Congress, the Congress which won 415 seats in the 1984 elections could not win even the same number of seats after 30 years, the percentage of votes it got at the time of Rajiv Gandhi Had met 1984 main indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad hue chunaav main congress ko 48% vot mili the, jabaki pichley aam chunaav main congress 44 siton par simatakar rah gai thi
 But the bad phase of the Congress was not limited to the Lok Sabha elections

 is saal ke shuru main 5 rajyon main chunaav hue, jisamen se punjab main congress ne akali-bijepi ko dhul chataayee, lekin uttarakhand or manipur bijepi ke haathon main chale gaye
 By the way, the Congress emerged as the largest party in Goa and Manipur, but the BJP was successful in forming the government
 gujarat main bijepi ek baar phir apana garh bachaane main kaamyaab rahi, jabaki himachal pradesh main usne congress ke kile main send laga di or uski sarkaar banane ja rahi he

 Similarly, after being convicted, the punishment for sentencing them to five years is 1 rupee 30 paise, while the punishment for imprisonment for seven years is 2 rupees 50 paise
 tippaniyan By the way, speculation is also being made on speculation that he will go to jail soon after the verdict, or he will be released on bail for the time being
 salmaan khan ke videsh jane par pabandi lagaai jaaegi yaa nahin
 On the other hand, the Mumbai Police says that whether the betting is on cricket or on Salman Khan is wrong, then if anyone is found involved in any such activity, strict action will be taken against him
 iske liye krime branch kii samaaj seva shakha ko sachet kar diya gaya he
 Due to this strictness of the Mumbai Police, most of the bookies are running their black business outside Mumbai, especially from Gujarat, Bengaluru, Dubai and Bangkok 
 jab sabhi chaahane waalon ke man main yahi sawaal ghumad rahe hon, to bhala satorie kaise peeche rahete, so, logon kii isi utsukata kaa phayda uthaate hue unhone karodon rupee kaa satta inhen sawaalon par lagaaya he, or dilachasp tathy yah he ki satta bazaar se jude logon kii baton par bharosa kiya jaae to is vakt salmaan khan par lage satte ne indian premier lig (ipel) par lagane vaale satte ko bhi pachhad diya he, haalanki salmaan khan par ab tak kitne rupee kaa satta lag chukaa he, iskaa koi sateek aankada mil paanaa mushkil he
 There are very few occasions in the betting markets when there is such a betting on a court decision, but Salman Khan is a 'big' and popular artist and he has crores of fans, so, the bookies are busy taking advantage of this time Huh
 salmaan khan ko lekar unke doshi yaa nirdosh qaraar die jane lekar is baat tak par satta lagaaya ja rahaa he ki unhen kitne saal kii sazaa sunai ja sakati he
 According to Danish, who keeps a close watch on Satta Bazar and informer of Mumbai Police, the price of Salman Khan's conviction is 30 paise, while the price of Rs
280 paise is Rs
280 if he is acquitted
 isi tarah doshi sabit hone ke baad unhen paanch saal kii sajaa sunaae jane kaa bhav 1 rupaya 30 paise he, jabaki saat saal kaid kii sajaa kaa bhav 2 rupee 50 paise he
 The comments vaise, satta in atakalon par bhi lagaaya ja rahaa he ki vah faisle ke turant baad jail jaaenge, yaa unhen jamaanat par philhal chhod diya jayega
 Whether or not Salman Khan will go abroad will be banned
 duusari ore, mumbai police kaa kahana he ki satta chaahe cricket par lage yaa salmaan khan par, galat he, so, agar koi bhi is tarah kii kisi gatividhi main lipt paaya jaataa he to uske khilaaf kadi karrwai kii jaaegi
 For this, the social branch of Crime Branch has been alerted
 mumbai police kii isi sakhti ke chalate zyaadaatar satorie mumbai ke baahar, khaskar gujarat, bengaluru, dubai or bainkak se apane kaale kaarobaar ko anjaam dene main lage hai

 phek news kaa ek or hamasafar he ped news
 The element of taking money is also in paid news and also in fake news
 chunaavon main ped news kaa kya aatank he aap kisi bhi dal ke ummidavaar se puch lijie
 Now many ways of paid news have come
 chunaav aate hi vipakshi dalon ke kilaaf sting opareshnon kii baadh aa jaati he, survey main vipaksh ko kamazor bataaya jane lagata he
 There was also a dispute about printing wrong survey in UP elections
 ped news main hota yah he ki paisa lekar ummidavaar ke bare main khabar chhapati he ki jansailab umada, falana dhimkaana kii chal rahi he lahar
 This is the new generation of fake news
 hamane internet par ped news ko lekar search kiya to kai jaankariyaan saamne ain
 You know that the Election Commission at the state level and district level creates Media Certification and Monitoring Committees (MCMC) to catch paid news in every election
 2013 main chunaav ayog kii ek report ai thi, jiske anusaar 17 rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main ped news ke 1400 maamle saamne aae the
 All these elections were held between 2010 and 2013
 2012 kaa punjab ke vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke 523 maamle saamne aae the
 The 2012 Gujarat assembly election saw 414 paid news cases
 2012 ke himachal pradesh ke chunaav main 104 maamle saamne aae
 There were 93 cases of paid news in the 2013 Karnataka Assembly elections
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main media kaa jo rup tha wo abhootpurv tha
 This election also could not escape from paid news
 kai baar ped news ke maamle report bhi nahin hote hai
 Their methods have changed so much that it is difficult to catch up and yet paid news has not been defined separately nor has punishment been provided for
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ped news ke 787 cese saamne aae the
 The maximum number of 223 cases were reported from Rajasthan and 152 from Punjab
 andhra pradesh main 116 or uttar pradesh main 86 maamle darj hue hai
 There were 116 confirmed cases in Andhra, but 2168 notices were issued regarding paid news
 2014 ke chunaav main ped news ke maamle main ummidavaaron ko 3100 notice jari kiye gaye the
 Paid news is not stopping and fake news has also arrived
 2017 ke punjab or upi ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi ped news ke maamle darj kiye gaye
 On 23 February 2017 Newslaundry site reported that not a single case of paid news was registered in Goa and Manipur
 ham abhi tak apane chunaavon ko hinsa or booth capcharing ke alaava in durgunon se mukt nahin kar paae hai
 Money is caught but the use of money has not stopped yet
 oktober 2011 main ped news ke aarope main upi kii ek vidhayak umalesh yadav kii sadsyta khaarij kar di gai thi
 Was an MLA of Rashtriya Parivartan Dal
 magar kisi bade dal kaa ummidavaar ped news karata hua barkhaast nahin hua he
 In this sequence, another leader has been caught, whose case has also been proved in court
 narottam mishra madhya pradesh ke mantri hai
 According to the order of Delhi High Court, Narottam Mishra will not be able to vote in the presidential election
 madhya pradesh hai court ne narottam mishra ko 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke maamle main doshi paaya he
 The Election Commission has banned Narottam Mishra from contesting elections for three years
 is lihaaz se narottam mishra 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ummidavaar nahin ban paayenge
 The Commission observed that Narottam Mishra did not show the amount spent on paid news in the Datia Assembly in the 2008 elections in his expenditure
 narottam mishra is vakt jal sansaadhan, jansampark or sansadeey kaary mantri hai
 He remains in office even after being found guilty in the paid news case
 mishra ji nyaay ke liye lard rahe hai
 He is in no hurry to resign immediately with a load of morality
 ek baat ko lekar satark rahiyegaa
 The media is in danger of being called fake news
 iskaa laabh trump jaise netaa uthaa hi rahe hai news channelon ko phek news kahkar
 The fake news is called fake news
 patrakaron se ummid kii jaati he ki khabar chhapane se pehle teen chaar baar pushti kar len lekin ab aapse bhi ummid kii jaati he ki khabar par yakeen karne se pehle kai sorce se conform kar len
 It should not happen that you forget to go to the office to confirm the news which you have read in the newspaper
 ab to news houseing sosayadi ke whatsap group se bhi aane laga he
 The leaders have their own tweeter handles, youtube channels
 vahi jhooth bol rahe hon to aap kya karenge
 Political parties have surrounded people up to the locality in the whatsapp group
 group kaa member banaakar siyaasi kachra thelte rahete hai jisamen se zyaadaatar phek news hi hota he
 In the beginning of this series, we gave you an example of the Millennium bug, that is, to two, now you want to give the example of Monkey Man spread in 2001 in Delhi and many areas of North India
 manki main na to manki tha na hi main tha magar main, vimen children manki main ke aane or kaat lene kii kalpanaaon main kho gaye
 Used to stay awake all night
 kisi ne use dekha nahin magar bataane waalon kii kami nahin thi ki manki main kaisaa he
 Fake News is going to do the same for all of us
 ham phek news ko lekar log raaton ko jaagenge, samudaayon ko ladate dekhenge, kisi ko peetate dekhenge balki dekh hi rahe hai
 i am giving the example of Monkey Man to make it clear that we are not practicing the practice of digesting fake news from today
 us vakt media bhi manki main ko koob cover karata tha
 There are many reports about the Monkey Man in ndtv's archive
 jise siddharth pandey, barkhaa dutt, aradhana sharma, vartika nanda ne cover kiya tha, jo tab enditivi ke saath the
 Amitabh Revi, Sera Jacob, Maya Mirchandani are still with NDTV to cover Monkey Man
 tab enditivi india nahin tha, star news tha
 We want to show the old report and the statement of the people in it so that you know what the condition of fake news or rumor is
 bich bich main iskaa trial bhi hota hi rahata he jaise spain or morokkon kii seemaa kii chamakdaar tasviir lagaakar jane anjaane main kiya gaya
 There are many such examples
 mujhe jahaan tak yaad he manki main kii pehali khabar upi ke ek hindi akhbaar main kahin kone main chhapi thi par sabit karne ke liye uski koi cliping nahin he
 First we see some old reports
 tab kii report dedh minute se zyaada lambii nahin hoti thi
 There is no need to worry about English nor do those who sing fake pride in the name of Hindi get into the trap
 manki main kii tarah phek news bhi bhesh badal kar hi aata he aapako gumraah karne ke liye
 Fantasies started flying in the air about Monkey Man
 sabane manki main ke bare main is tarah se bayaan kiya ki aap sunakar hansate hanset lotpot ho jaaenge
 But keep laughing and keep wondering whether Fake News has made such a condition for you
 manki main kaa aisa bavaal uthaa tha ki police or sarkaar bhi usamen vyast ho gai
 Sometimes the police said that it is the work of anti-social elements
 chashmadidon ke anusaar kam se kam do log hai jo milakar anjaam de rahe hai
 Tell the eyewitnesses that they do not know what Monkey Man looks like, you have heard all the different details, but on the basis of them the police started to believe that there are two people
 dilli police se us vakt ummid kii jane lagi ki wo manki main kaa potrate banaae jaise aantki hamalon ke baad aatankwaadiyon kaa banataa he
 Once the police said that he is neither a human nor a monkey, there is no other animal
 jab samaaj baura jaataa he to uskaa asar police ke kaam par padataa he
 What would the police do
 raat bhar log aatankit rahete, koi kahin se girtaa, yaa koi apni hi chaaya dekhakar manki main manki main chillane lagata
 In the end, the Delhi Police gave a reward of 50,000
 grahamantralay se rapid police force maangi gai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, a special team was formed whose task was to investigate the monkey man
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai
 One is killed by fake news and one is fake news king
 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 In 2013, a report of the Election Commission came out, according to which 1400 paid news cases were reported in 17 state assembly elections
 ye sabhi chunaav 2010 se 2013 ke bich hue the
 In the 2012 Punjab Assembly elections, 523 cases of paid news were reported
 2012 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke 414 maamle saamne aae
 The 2012 Himachal Pradesh election saw 104 cases
 2013 ke karnataka vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke 93 maamle saamne aae the
 The form of media in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was unprecedented
 yah chunaav bhi ped news se batch nahin sakaa tha
 Many times paid news cases are also not reported
 unke tareeke itane badal gaye hai ki pakadana bhi mushkil hota he or abhi tak ped news ko alag se paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya he or na hi iske liye sazaa kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 There were 787 cases of paid news in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 sabase adhik 223 maamle rajasthan se or 152 maamle punjab se darj hue the
 116 cases have been registered in Andhra Pradesh and 86 in Uttar Pradesh
 andhra main 116 conform cese the, lekin 2168 notice jari hue the ped news ke sambandh main
 In the 2014 election, 3100 notices were issued to candidates in the case of paid news
 ped news nahin ruk rahaa he or phek news bhi aa gaya he
 Paid news cases were also reported in the 2017 Punjab and UP assembly elections
 23 farvari 2017 ke newaloundry kii site par isaki khabar he ki goa or manipur main ped news kaa ek bhi maamla darj nahin hua tha
 We have not yet been able to free our elections from violence and booth capturing
 paise pakade jate hai magar paise kaa istemaal abhi tak nahin rukaa he
 In October 2011, the membership of UP MLA Umlesh Yadav was rejected on the charge of paid news
 rashtriya parivartan dal kii vidhayak thim
 But a large party candidate has not been dismissed while doing paid news
 is kram main ek or netaa pakade gaye hai jinka maamla adaalat main bhi sabit ho gaya he
 Narottam Mishra is the minister of Madhya Pradesh
 dilli hoicourt ke aadesh ke mutabik narottam mishra raashtrapati chunaav main matdaan nahin kar sakenge
 The Madhya Pradesh High Court has found Narottam Mishra guilty in the 2008 Assembly elections in a paid news case
 chunaav ayog ne narottam mishra par teen saal ke liye chunaav ladane par pratibandh laga diya he
 In this context, Narottam Mishra will not be a candidate in the 2018 assembly elections
 ayog ne paaya ki narottam mishra ne 2008 ke chunaav main datia vidhansabha main ped news par karch kii gai rakam ko apane karche main nahin dikhaaya he
 Narottam Mishra is currently the Minister of Water Resources, Public Relations and Parliamentary Affairs
 ped news ke maamle main doshi paye jane ke baad bhi pad par bane hue hai
 Mishra is fighting for justice
 unhone naitikta kaa lod lekar turant istipha dene kii koi jaldbaazi nahin kii he
 Be cautious about one thing
 media ko phek news kehane main khatra he
 Leaders like Trump are taking advantage of this by calling news channels as fake news
 jo phek news he use hi phek news kaha jaae
 Journalists are expected to confirm the news three or four times before printing it, but now you are also expected to confirm with many sources before you believe the news
 kahin aisa na ho jaae ki jo khabar akhbaar main padhi he use conform karne ke chakkar main offis janaa hi bhul jaaen
 Now the whatsapp group of News Housing Society has also started coming
 netaaon ke apane twitor handle hai, you tub channel hai
 What will you do if you are telling the same lie
 raajnneetik dalon ne whatsap group main mohalle tak ke logon ko gher liya he
 By creating members of the group, they continue to throw political trash, most of which is fake news
 is siries ke shuru main hamane aapako milinium bag yani vaai tu ke kaa udhaaharan diya tha, ab aapako 2001 ke dilli or uttar bharat ke kai ilaakon main faile manki main kaa udhaaharan dena chaahate hai
 The Monkey Man was neither a monkey nor a man, but the man, the Children's Children, was lost in fantasies of the Monkey Man's arrival and bite
 raat bhar jaagate the
 No one saw him but there was no shortage of people to tell him how Monkey Man is
 phek news ham sabakaa yahi haal karne vaala he
 We will wake up at night with regard to fake news, watch the communities fighting, see someone beating, rather they are watching
 manki main kaa udhaaharan isliye de rahaa hum taaki yah saaf rahe ki phek news ko pachaane kii practice ham aaj se nahin kar rahe hai
 At that time the media also covered Monkey Man very well
 enditivi ke archive main manki main ko lekar kai report hai
 Which was covered by Siddharth Pandey, Barkha Dutt, Aradhana Sharma, Vartika Nanda, who were then with NDTV
 manki main cover karne waalon main amitabh revi, sera jacob, maaya mirchandani ab bhi enditivi ke saath hai
 NDTV was not India then, it was Star News
 ham puraani report or usamen logon ke bayaan ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai taaki aapako pataa chale ki phek news yaa afvaah hamaari kya haalat karata he
 In between, it continues to be trialled as if it were unknowingly done by putting a bright picture of the border between Spain and Morocco
 aise anek udhaaharan hai
 As far as i remember, Monkey Man's first news was printed in a Hindi newspaper in UP somewhere in the corner but there is no clipping to prove it
 pehle ham kuch puraani report dekhte hai
 The report then was not longer than one and a half minutes
 angrezi se ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he na hi hindi ke naam par nakli gaurav gaan karne waalon ke jhaanse main aane kii zarurat he
 Like monkey man, fake news also comes in disguise to mislead you
 manki main ko lekar kalpanaaen hawa main udne lageen
 Everyone said about the Monkey Man in such a way that you would laugh and laugh with laughter
 par hansate bhi rahiye or sochate bhi rahiye ki kahin phek news ne aapaki aisi haalat to nahin kar di he
 The monkey man had such a ruckus that the police and government too got busy with it
 kabhi police ne kaha ki asaamaajik tatwon kaa kaam he
 According to eyewitnesses, there are at least two people who are executing together
 bataaiye chashmadid ko yahi pataa nahin ki manki main kaisaa dikhataa he, sabake alag alag vivaran aapane sune hi magar unke aadhaar par police maanane lagi kii do log hai
 At that time it was expected from the Delhi Police that they make portraits of Monkey Man like terrorists after terror attacks
 ek baar to police ne kah diya ki na to wo insaan he na hi bandar he, koi or jaanavar he
 When society goes mad, it affects the work of the police
 police kya karti
 Throughout the night people would be terrorized, some would fall from somewhere, or some would see their own shadow and shout Monkey Man Monkey Man
 ant main haar kar dilli police ne 50,000 kaa inaam rakh diya
 Rapid Police Force was sought from the Home Ministry
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek vishesh team bana di gai jiskaa kaam tha manki main kii jaanch karnaa
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he
 The Expert Committee also had members from the National Institute of Human Behavior (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL)
 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main media kaa jo rup tha wo abhootpurv tha
 This election also could not escape from paid news
 kai baar ped news ke maamle report bhi nahin hote hai
 Their methods have changed so much that it is difficult to catch up and yet paid news has not been defined separately nor has punishment been provided for
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ped news ke 787 cese saamne aae the
 The maximum number of 223 cases were reported from Rajasthan and 152 from Punjab
 andhra pradesh main 116 or uttar pradesh main 86 maamle darj hue hai
 There were 116 confirmed cases in Andhra, but 2168 notices were issued regarding paid news
 2014 ke chunaav main ped news ke maamle main ummidavaaron ko 3100 notice jari kiye gaye the
 Paid news is not stopping and fake news has also arrived
 2017 ke punjab or upi ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi ped news ke maamle darj kiye gaye
 On 23 February 2017 Newslaundry site reported that not a single case of paid news was registered in Goa and Manipur
 ham abhi tak apane chunaavon ko hinsa or booth capcharing ke alaava in durgunon se mukt nahin kar paae hai
 Money is caught but the use of money has not stopped yet
 oktober 2011 main ped news ke aarope main upi kii ek vidhayak umalesh yadav kii sadsyta khaarij kar di gai thi
 Was an MLA of Rashtriya Parivartan Dal
 magar kisi bade dal kaa ummidavaar ped news karata hua barkhaast nahin hua he
 In this sequence, another leader has been caught, whose case has also been proved in court
 narottam mishra madhya pradesh ke mantri hai
 According to the order of Delhi High Court, Narottam Mishra will not be able to vote in the presidential election
 madhya pradesh hai court ne narottam mishra ko 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ped news ke maamle main doshi paaya he
 The Election Commission has banned Narottam Mishra from contesting elections for three years
 is lihaaz se narottam mishra 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaav main ummidavaar nahin ban paayenge
 The Commission observed that Narottam Mishra did not show the amount spent on paid news in the Datia Assembly in the 2008 elections in his expenditure
 narottam mishra is vakt jal sansaadhan, jansampark or sansadeey kaary mantri hai
 He remains in office even after being found guilty in the paid news case
 mishra ji nyaay ke liye lard rahe hai
 He is in no hurry to resign immediately with a load of morality
 ek baat ko lekar satark rahiyegaa
 The media is in danger of being called fake news
 iskaa laabh trump jaise netaa uthaa hi rahe hai news channelon ko phek news kahkar
 The fake news is called fake news
 patrakaron se ummid kii jaati he ki khabar chhapane se pehle teen chaar baar pushti kar len lekin ab aapse bhi ummid kii jaati he ki khabar par yakeen karne se pehle kai sorce se conform kar len
 It should not happen that you forget to go to the office to confirm the news which you have read in the newspaper
 ab to news houseing sosayadi ke whatsap group se bhi aane laga he
 The leaders have their own tweeter handles, youtube channels
 vahi jhooth bol rahe hon to aap kya karenge
 Political parties have surrounded people up to the locality in the whatsapp group
 group kaa member banaakar siyaasi kachra thelte rahete hai jisamen se zyaadaatar phek news hi hota he
 In the beginning of this series, we gave you an example of the Millennium bug, that is, to two, now you want to give the example of Monkey Man spread in 2001 in Delhi and many areas of North India
 manki main na to manki tha na hi main tha magar main, vimen children manki main ke aane or kaat lene kii kalpanaaon main kho gaye
 Used to stay awake all night
 kisi ne use dekha nahin magar bataane waalon kii kami nahin thi ki manki main kaisaa he
 Fake News is going to do the same for all of us
 ham phek news ko lekar log raaton ko jaagenge, samudaayon ko ladate dekhenge, kisi ko peetate dekhenge balki dekh hi rahe hai
 i am giving the example of Monkey Man to make it clear that we are not practicing the practice of digesting fake news from today
 us vakt media bhi manki main ko koob cover karata tha
 There are many reports about the Monkey Man in ndtv's archive
 jise siddharth pandey, barkhaa dutt, aradhana sharma, vartika nanda ne cover kiya tha, jo tab enditivi ke saath the
 Amitabh Revi, Sera Jacob, Maya Mirchandani are still with NDTV to cover Monkey Man
 tab enditivi india nahin tha, star news tha
 We want to show the old report and the statement of the people in it so that you know what the condition of fake news or rumor is
 bich bich main iskaa trial bhi hota hi rahata he jaise spain or morokkon kii seemaa kii chamakdaar tasviir lagaakar jane anjaane main kiya gaya
 There are many such examples
 mujhe jahaan tak yaad he manki main kii pehali khabar upi ke ek hindi akhbaar main kahin kone main chhapi thi par sabit karne ke liye uski koi cliping nahin he
 First we see some old reports
 tab kii report dedh minute se zyaada lambii nahin hoti thi
 There is no need to worry about English nor do those who sing fake pride in the name of Hindi get into the trap
 manki main kii tarah phek news bhi bhesh badal kar hi aata he aapako gumraah karne ke liye
 Fantasies started flying in the air about Monkey Man
 sabane manki main ke bare main is tarah se bayaan kiya ki aap sunakar hansate hanset lotpot ho jaaenge
 But keep laughing and keep wondering whether Fake News has made such a condition for you
 manki main kaa aisa bavaal uthaa tha ki police or sarkaar bhi usamen vyast ho gai
 Sometimes the police said that it is the work of anti-social elements
 chashmadidon ke anusaar kam se kam do log hai jo milakar anjaam de rahe hai
 Tell the eyewitnesses that they do not know what Monkey Man looks like, you have heard all the different details, but on the basis of them the police started to believe that there are two people
 dilli police se us vakt ummid kii jane lagi ki wo manki main kaa potrate banaae jaise aantki hamalon ke baad aatankwaadiyon kaa banataa he
 Once the police said that he is neither a human nor a monkey, there is no other animal
 jab samaaj baura jaataa he to uskaa asar police ke kaam par padataa he
 What would the police do
 raat bhar log aatankit rahete, koi kahin se girtaa, yaa koi apni hi chaaya dekhakar manki main manki main chillane lagata
 In the end, the Delhi Police gave a reward of 50,000
 grahamantralay se rapid police force maangi gai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, a special team was formed whose task was to investigate the monkey man
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai
 One is killed by fake news and one is fake news king
 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 Paid news is not stopping and fake news has also arrived
 2017 ke punjab or upi ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi ped news ke maamle darj kiye gaye
 On 23 February 2017 Newslaundry site reported that not a single case of paid news was registered in Goa and Manipur

 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 Narottam Mishra is the minister of Madhya Pradesh
 dilli hoicourt ke aadesh ke mutabik narottam mishra raashtrapati chunaav main matdaan nahin kar sakenge
 The Madhya Pradesh High Court has found Narottam Mishra guilty in the 2008 Assembly elections in a paid news case
 chunaav ayog ne narottam mishra par teen saal ke liye chunaav ladane par pratibandh laga diya he
 In this context, Narottam Mishra will not be a candidate in the 2018 assembly elections
 ayog ne paaya ki narottam mishra ne 2008 ke chunaav main datia vidhansabha main ped news par karch kii gai rakam ko apane karche main nahin dikhaaya he
 Narottam Mishra is currently the Minister of Water Resources, Public Relations and Parliamentary Affairs
 ped news ke maamle main doshi paye jane ke baad bhi pad par bane hue hai
 Mishra is fighting for justice
 unhone naitikta kaa lod lekar turant istipha dene kii koi jaldbaazi nahin kii he
 Be cautious about one thing
 media ko phek news kehane main khatra he
 Leaders like Trump are taking advantage of this by calling news channels as fake news
 jo phek news he use hi phek news kaha jaae
 Journalists are expected to confirm the news three or four times before printing it, but now you are also expected to confirm with many sources before you believe the news
 kahin aisa na ho jaae ki jo khabar akhbaar main padhi he use conform karne ke chakkar main offis janaa hi bhul jaaen
 Now the whatsapp group of News Housing Society has also started coming
 netaaon ke apane twitor handle hai, you tub channel hai
 What will you do if you are telling the same lie
 raajnneetik dalon ne whatsap group main mohalle tak ke logon ko gher liya he
 By creating members of the group, they continue to throw political trash, most of which is fake news
 is siries ke shuru main hamane aapako milinium bag yani vaai tu ke kaa udhaaharan diya tha, ab aapako 2001 ke dilli or uttar bharat ke kai ilaakon main faile manki main kaa udhaaharan dena chaahate hai
 The Monkey Man was neither a monkey nor a man, but the man, the Children's Children, was lost in fantasies of the Monkey Man's arrival and bite
 raat bhar jaagate the
 No one saw him but there was no shortage of people to tell him how Monkey Man is
 phek news ham sabakaa yahi haal karne vaala he
 We will wake up at night with regard to fake news, watch the communities fighting, see someone beating, rather they are watching
 manki main kaa udhaaharan isliye de rahaa hum taaki yah saaf rahe ki phek news ko pachaane kii practice ham aaj se nahin kar rahe hai
 At that time the media also covered Monkey Man very well
 enditivi ke archive main manki main ko lekar kai report hai
 Which was covered by Siddharth Pandey, Barkha Dutt, Aradhana Sharma, Vartika Nanda, who were then with NDTV
 manki main cover karne waalon main amitabh revi, sera jacob, maaya mirchandani ab bhi enditivi ke saath hai
 NDTV was not India then, it was Star News
 ham puraani report or usamen logon ke bayaan ko dikhaanaa chaahate hai taaki aapako pataa chale ki phek news yaa afvaah hamaari kya haalat karata he
 In between, it continues to be trialled as if it were unknowingly done by putting a bright picture of the border between Spain and Morocco
 aise anek udhaaharan hai
 As far as i remember, Monkey Man's first news was printed in a Hindi newspaper in UP somewhere in the corner but there is no clipping to prove it
 pehle ham kuch puraani report dekhte hai
 The report then was not longer than one and a half minutes
 angrezi se ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he na hi hindi ke naam par nakli gaurav gaan karne waalon ke jhaanse main aane kii zarurat he
 Like monkey man, fake news also comes in disguise to mislead you
 manki main ko lekar kalpanaaen hawa main udne lageen
 Everyone said about the Monkey Man in such a way that you would laugh and laugh with laughter
 par hansate bhi rahiye or sochate bhi rahiye ki kahin phek news ne aapaki aisi haalat to nahin kar di he
 The monkey man had such a ruckus that the police and government too got busy with it
 kabhi police ne kaha ki asaamaajik tatwon kaa kaam he
 According to eyewitnesses, there are at least two people who are executing together
 bataaiye chashmadid ko yahi pataa nahin ki manki main kaisaa dikhataa he, sabake alag alag vivaran aapane sune hi magar unke aadhaar par police maanane lagi kii do log hai
 At that time it was expected from the Delhi Police that they make portraits of Monkey Man like terrorists after terror attacks
 ek baar to police ne kah diya ki na to wo insaan he na hi bandar he, koi or jaanavar he
 When society goes mad, it affects the work of the police
 police kya karti
 Throughout the night people would be terrorized, some would fall from somewhere, or some would see their own shadow and shout Monkey Man Monkey Man
 ant main haar kar dilli police ne 50,000 kaa inaam rakh diya
 Rapid Police Force was sought from the Home Ministry
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek vishesh team bana di gai jiskaa kaam tha manki main kii jaanch karnaa
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he
 The Expert Committee also had members from the National Institute of Human Behavior (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL)
 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 ek baat ko lekar satark rahiyegaa
 The media is in danger of being called fake news
 iskaa laabh trump jaise netaa uthaa hi rahe hai news channelon ko phek news kahkar
 The fake news is called fake news
 patrakaron se ummid kii jaati he ki khabar chhapane se pehle teen chaar baar pushti kar len lekin ab aapse bhi ummid kii jaati he ki khabar par yakeen karne se pehle kai sorce se conform kar len
 It should not happen that you forget to go to the office to confirm the news which you have read in the newspaper
 ab to news houseing sosayadi ke whatsap group se bhi aane laga he
 The leaders have their own tweeter handles, youtube channels
 vahi jhooth bol rahe hon to aap kya karenge
 Political parties have surrounded people up to the locality in the whatsapp group
 group kaa member banaakar siyaasi kachra thelte rahete hai jisamen se zyaadaatar phek news hi hota he
 In the beginning of this series, we gave you an example of the Millennium bug, that is, to two, now you want to give the example of Monkey Man spread in 2001 in Delhi and many areas of North India
 manki main na to manki tha na hi main tha magar main, vimen children manki main ke aane or kaat lene kii kalpanaaon main kho gaye
 Used to stay awake all night
 kisi ne use dekha nahin magar bataane waalon kii kami nahin thi ki manki main kaisaa he
 Fake News is going to do the same for all of us
 ham phek news ko lekar log raaton ko jaagenge, samudaayon ko ladate dekhenge, kisi ko peetate dekhenge balki dekh hi rahe hai
 i am giving the example of Monkey Man to make it clear that we are not practicing the practice of digesting fake news from today
 us vakt media bhi manki main ko koob cover karata tha
 There are many reports about the Monkey Man in ndtv's archive
 jise siddharth pandey, barkhaa dutt, aradhana sharma, vartika nanda ne cover kiya tha, jo tab enditivi ke saath the
 Amitabh Revi, Sera Jacob, Maya Mirchandani are still with NDTV to cover Monkey Man
 tab enditivi india nahin tha, star news tha
 We want to show the old report and the statement of the people in it so that you know what the condition of fake news or rumor is
 bich bich main iskaa trial bhi hota hi rahata he jaise spain or morokkon kii seemaa kii chamakdaar tasviir lagaakar jane anjaane main kiya gaya
 There are many such examples
 mujhe jahaan tak yaad he manki main kii pehali khabar upi ke ek hindi akhbaar main kahin kone main chhapi thi par sabit karne ke liye uski koi cliping nahin he
 First we see some old reports
 tab kii report dedh minute se zyaada lambii nahin hoti thi
 There is no need to worry about English nor do those who sing fake pride in the name of Hindi get into the trap
 manki main kii tarah phek news bhi bhesh badal kar hi aata he aapako gumraah karne ke liye
 Fantasies started flying in the air about Monkey Man
 sabane manki main ke bare main is tarah se bayaan kiya ki aap sunakar hansate hanset lotpot ho jaaenge
 But keep laughing and keep wondering whether Fake News has made such a condition for you
 manki main kaa aisa bavaal uthaa tha ki police or sarkaar bhi usamen vyast ho gai
 Sometimes the police said that it is the work of anti-social elements
 chashmadidon ke anusaar kam se kam do log hai jo milakar anjaam de rahe hai
 Tell the eyewitnesses that they do not know what Monkey Man looks like, you have heard all the different details, but on the basis of them the police started to believe that there are two people
 dilli police se us vakt ummid kii jane lagi ki wo manki main kaa potrate banaae jaise aantki hamalon ke baad aatankwaadiyon kaa banataa he
 Once the police said that he is neither a human nor a monkey, there is no other animal
 jab samaaj baura jaataa he to uskaa asar police ke kaam par padataa he
 What would the police do
 raat bhar log aatankit rahete, koi kahin se girtaa, yaa koi apni hi chaaya dekhakar manki main manki main chillane lagata
 In the end, the Delhi Police gave a reward of 50,000
 grahamantralay se rapid police force maangi gai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, a special team was formed whose task was to investigate the monkey man
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai
 One is killed by fake news and one is fake news king
 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 The Monkey Man was neither a monkey nor a man, but the man, the Children's Children, was lost in fantasies of the Monkey Man's arrival and bite
 raat bhar jaagate the
 No one saw him but there was no shortage of people to tell him how Monkey Man is
 phek news ham sabakaa yahi haal karne vaala he

 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 us vakt media bhi manki main ko koob cover karata tha
 There are many reports about the Monkey Man in ndtv's archive
 jise siddharth pandey, barkhaa dutt, aradhana sharma, vartika nanda ne cover kiya tha, jo tab enditivi ke saath the
 Amitabh Revi, Sera Jacob, Maya Mirchandani are still with NDTV to cover Monkey Man
 tab enditivi india nahin tha, star news tha
 We want to show the old report and the statement of the people in it so that you know what the condition of fake news or rumor is
 bich bich main iskaa trial bhi hota hi rahata he jaise spain or morokkon kii seemaa kii chamakdaar tasviir lagaakar jane anjaane main kiya gaya
 There are many such examples
 mujhe jahaan tak yaad he manki main kii pehali khabar upi ke ek hindi akhbaar main kahin kone main chhapi thi par sabit karne ke liye uski koi cliping nahin he
 First we see some old reports
 tab kii report dedh minute se zyaada lambii nahin hoti thi
 There is no need to worry about English nor do those who sing fake pride in the name of Hindi get into the trap
 manki main kii tarah phek news bhi bhesh badal kar hi aata he aapako gumraah karne ke liye
 Fantasies started flying in the air about Monkey Man
 sabane manki main ke bare main is tarah se bayaan kiya ki aap sunakar hansate hanset lotpot ho jaaenge
 But keep laughing and keep wondering whether Fake News has made such a condition for you
 manki main kaa aisa bavaal uthaa tha ki police or sarkaar bhi usamen vyast ho gai
 Sometimes the police said that it is the work of anti-social elements
 chashmadidon ke anusaar kam se kam do log hai jo milakar anjaam de rahe hai
 Tell the eyewitnesses that they do not know what Monkey Man looks like, you have heard all the different details, but on the basis of them the police started to believe that there are two people
 dilli police se us vakt ummid kii jane lagi ki wo manki main kaa potrate banaae jaise aantki hamalon ke baad aatankwaadiyon kaa banataa he
 Once the police said that he is neither a human nor a monkey, there is no other animal
 jab samaaj baura jaataa he to uskaa asar police ke kaam par padataa he
 What would the police do
 raat bhar log aatankit rahete, koi kahin se girtaa, yaa koi apni hi chaaya dekhakar manki main manki main chillane lagata
 In the end, the Delhi Police gave a reward of 50,000
 grahamantralay se rapid police force maangi gai
 Seeing the seriousness of the matter, a special team was formed whose task was to investigate the monkey man
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai
 One is killed by fake news and one is fake news king
 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan also had to make a statement that there is no shortage of salt
 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 Like monkey man, fake news also comes in disguise to mislead you
 manki main ko lekar kalpanaaen hawa main udne lageen
 Everyone said about the Monkey Man in such a way that you would laugh and laugh with laughter
 par hansate bhi rahiye or sochate bhi rahiye ki kahin phek news ne aapaki aisi haalat to nahin kar di he
 The monkey man had such a ruckus that the police and government too got busy with it
 kabhi police ne kaha ki asaamaajik tatwon kaa kaam he
 According to eyewitnesses, there are at least two people who are executing together
 bataaiye chashmadid ko yahi pataa nahin ki manki main kaisaa dikhataa he, sabake alag alag vivaran aapane sune hi magar unke aadhaar par police maanane lagi kii do log hai
 At that time it was expected from the Delhi Police that they make portraits of Monkey Man like terrorists after terror attacks
 ek baar to police ne kah diya ki na to wo insaan he na hi bandar he, koi or jaanavar he
 When society goes mad, it affects the work of the police
 police kya karti
 Throughout the night people would be terrorized, some would fall from somewhere, or some would see their own shadow and shout Monkey Man Monkey Man
 ant main haar kar dilli police ne 50,000 kaa inaam rakh diya
 Rapid Police Force was sought from the Home Ministry
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek vishesh team bana di gai jiskaa kaam tha manki main kii jaanch karnaa
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he

 afvaahon kaa kya, wo udate udate mumbai pahunchi kii namak 200 rupee kilo ho gaya he
 The Mumbai Police had to tweet that it was a rumor
 kai jagahon se ye bhi khabar aa gai ki dukandaar vaaki 200 se lekar 600 rupee kilo namak bech rahe hai
 If any of you are reading this, please email so that we can know how you are feeling after looting 600 after believing in the rumor
 hyderabad police bhi is afvaah yajna ko rokane main kaaphi mehnat kar rahi thi
 We are also not disappointed with fake news because we have never disappointed fake news
 2009 main rakesh omprakash mehara ne dilli 6 banaai thi
 The film was also based on Monkey Man
 manki main kaa zikr karnaa zaruri tha
 Weaned the idol of Ganesha
 vaai tu ke ke tahat duniya ke computer ke nasht hone kaa daur bhi dekh liya, manki main bhi jhel liya or ab phek news jhel rahe hai
 i am wondering what we are going to do next
 jo bhi hoga wo phek news kaa koun sa nayaa varjan hoga jo hamen pagal banane vaala he
 When society goes mad, it affects the work of the police
 police kya karti
 Throughout the night people would be terrorized, some would fall from somewhere, or some would see their own shadow and shout Monkey Man Monkey Man
 ant main haar kar dilli police ne 50,000 kaa inaam rakh diya
 Rapid Police Force was sought from the Home Ministry
 is maamle kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue ek vishesh team bana di gai jiskaa kaam tha manki main kii jaanch karnaa
 We were not matured during Monkey Man's time, so people kept jumping all night
 phek news ke samay ham paripakv ho chuke hai
 Those found get silenced and start living in perceptions
 phek news ko pachaane kii hamaari kshamta main sudhaar bhi hua he or vikaas bhi
 This change has come in India as well as in the world
 ab log kai maamalon main iske aadhaar par raajnneetik faisle lekar khud kar garv se jaagruk matadaata bhi kehane se nahin chookte hai
 No one can understand the pain of Hillary Clinton, nor can you understand the happiness of Donald Trump
 ek phek news kaa maaraa he or ek phek news kaa badshaah he
 Haider was a film co-written by Basharat Pir
 achche patrkaar hai or inaki kitaab he karfu nite
 Basharat also has a report on Monkey Man
 20 june 2001 kii unki story bataati he ki dilli police ne manki main ke rahasy se pardaa uthaa diya he
 The report of the expert committee said that there was no monkey man
 is story main us vakt ke joint kamishnar suresh raay ne kaha he ki manki main main bandar yaa koi bhi jaanavar shaamil nahin he
 The Expert Committee also had members from the National Institute of Human Behavior (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL)
 police ne yah bhi kaha ki manki main ke peeche pakistan ke iesai kaa haath nahin he
 Nor is the hand of any goon gang
 dilli police ke kamishnar ajay raaj sharma ne to pachaas hazaar kaa inaam bhi rakh diya tha
 They thought it was a gang job
 saal 2001 kaa may or june maheenaa manki main main hi biit gaya
 Police received 379 phone calls
 303 bogus nikle
 70 people were injured
 ek cese main main the uttar purv dilli ke raghunatha pathak ko unke bhai ne hi maaraa tha
 People started imagining different types
 police ne mana ki media ke kawarej ne is paagalpan ko or badha diya
 Let me tell you that at that time many channels had formed a team of five reporters for Monkey Man's Bite
 jo raat bhar dilli main ghumaa karte the
 Many of them are prime time anchors today
 zaahir he 2001 main manki main ke zariye jo practice kiya tha, wo ab kaam aa rahaa he
 By the way, in the year before 2012, our channels also ran a lot that the world was going to end
 phek news naam main bhale junior ho magar is kaam main bharat ke news vaale bhi kam senior nahin hai
 Thankfully, people also understood that all is nonsense
 notebandi ke dauraan 2000 ke note main kisi chip ke lage hone kii khabar dikhaa di gai
 As a result of demonetisation, terrorism and Naxalism were also claimed to be erased or stopped
 pehali baar aatankwaad or naksalwad ko mitaane ke liye duniya main notebandi kaa sahaara liya gaya
 The difference is that black money is now being caught in new notes
 kuch log aaj bhi 2000 ke note main chip khoj rahe hai jo he hi nahin
 At the same time, the Reserve Bank of India denied that there is no such chip in the note
 us samay paanch sau or hazaar ke saadhe chaudaa lakh karod rupee chalan main the
 This was the statement of Minister Santosh Gangwar
 aaj tak rigerv bank of india nahin bataa sakaa ki notebandi ke baad 500 or 1000 ke kitne note waapas aae
 Recently, Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel could not tell before the Parliamentary Committee how much of the note was returned
 unka kahana he ki noton kii ginati chal rahi he
 The Reserve Bank has floated a tender to purchase a counting machine
 garvanar ne janvari main sansadeey samiti se kaha tha ki agali baar jab samiti ke saamne haazir honge to bataa denge ki kitne note waapas aae
 It is important to know how many notes have come back because only then will you know how many fake notes or black money were in circulation
 agar 14
 If 50 lakh crores comes then how will the demonetisation be successful
 is par purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne chutki lete hue kaha he ki notebandi ke aath maheene baad agar reserve bank counting kii mashin kharid rahaa he to kam se kam leez par le saktaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, tweeting that the government needs a math teacher, someone should apply to the PMO
 vaise jab aapse bank gin kar note lete hai, to rigerv bank ko bhi gin kar hi dete honge
 When banks counted the notes returned during demonetisation only then how the Reserve Bank is not able to count till now
 kya rigerv bank ye nahin bataa saktaa ki bainkon ne apni taraf se gin kar itane note diye hai
 We are counting on our side one more time
 shaayad manki main kii parighatna abhi samaapt nahin hui he
 Its new items keep coming in between and we have proved every time that whatever the rumor is, we will definitely believe it
 afvaah failaane waalon ko ham logon ne kabhi niraash nahin kiya he
 The comments 1995 main ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilane kaa lesan hamen abhi tak thik thik yaad he
 Then in November 2016, people of many states of the country got lined up in front of shops that there was going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 is maamle main dilli, kolkata, mumbai or hyderabad ke logon ne bhi chote shaharon ke saath acha pradarshan kiya tha
 The message came from whatsapp that there is going to be a shortage of sugar and salt
 upi ke tatkalin mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav afvaah bataate rahe or ziladhikari ko nirdesh dene lage ki afvaah failaane waalon par sakht karrwai karen
 What a good thing that punishment is for those who spread the word, but no punishment for those who believe the rumor
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal or kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ko bhi bayaan dena padaa ki namak kii koi kami nahin he
 What about the rumors, that she flew to Mumbai, that the salt has reached 200 rupees a kg
 mumbai police ko twit karnaa padaa ki ye afvaah he
 It has also been reported from many places that shopkeepers are really selling 200 to 600 rupees of salt
 aapmen se koi ye pard rahe hai to pleez email kiijie taaki ham jaan saken ki afvaah par yakeen kar 600 lutaaney ke baad ab aap kaisaa mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Hyderabad police was also working very hard to stop this rumor
 ham phek news se niraash isliye bhi nahin hote kyonki hamane kabhi bhi phek news ko niraash nahin kiya he
 Delhi 6 was created by Rakesh Omprakash Mehra in 2009
 yah film bhi manki main par aadhaarit thi
 It was necessary to mention Monkey Man
 ganesh ji kii murti ko doodh pilaa liya
 The world computer was also seen under Y2K, monkey man also suffered and now he is facing fake news
 main yah soch rahaa hum ki ab ham iske aage kya karne vaale hai
 Whatever will happen, what new version of fake news is going to make us mad
 manki main ke samay main ham mechor nahin hue the isliye log raat bhar kud phaand karte rahete the
 We are mature at the time of fake news
 jo miltaa he chupchaap gatak jate hai or dharanaon main jeene lagate hai
 Our ability to digest fake news has improved and developed
 yah badlaav bharat main bhi aayaa he or duniya main bhi aa chukaa he
 Now, in many cases, by taking political decisions based on this, the proud voters themselves do not miss out on being proud
 hillari clinton kaa dard koi nahin samaj saktaa or na hi aap donald trump kii kushi samaj sakate hai
 One is killed by fake news and one is fake news king
 haidar ek film ai thi, iske sah lekhak the bashaarat pir
 He is a good journalist and his book is Curfew Night
 bashaarat kii bhi ek report he manki main par
 His story dated 20 June 2001 tells that the Delhi Police has uncovered the mystery of Monkey Man
 export cameti kii report main kaha gaya he ki manki main tha hi nahin
 In this story, the then Joint Commissioner Suresh Rai has said that monkey or any animal is not included in the monkey
 export cameti main National Institute of Human Behaviour (NIHB) and Central Forensic Laboratory (CFL) ke sadsy bhi the
 The police also said that Pakistan's ISI is not behind the monkey man
 na hi kisi gunda giroh kaa haath he
 Commissioner of Delhi Police Ajay Raj Sharma had even kept a reward of fifty thousand
 unhen lagata tha ki yah kisi giroh kaa kaam he
 The months of May and June of 2001 passed in Monkey Man
 police ko 379 phone kals mili the
 303 bogus originated
 70 log ghayal ho gaye the
 In one case, Raghunath Pathak of North East Delhi was killed by his brother
 log tarah tarah kii kalpana karne lage the
 The police admitted that the media's coverage added to the insanity
 aapako bataa den ki us vakt kai channelon ne manki main kii bite ke liye paanch paanch reporter kii team banaai thi
 Who used to roam in Delhi overnight
 unheen main se kai aaj prime time ke ankar hai
 It is obvious that the practice done in 2001 through Monkey Man is now working
 vaise hamaare channelon ne 2012 se pehle ke saal main yah bhi khub chalaaya ki duniya khatm hone vaali he
 Fake News may be junior in name, but Indian news people are no less senior in this work
 ganimat he ki logon ne bhi samaj liya ki sab bakawaas he
 During the note ban, the 2000 note showed the news of a chip being attached
 vaise notebandi ke kaaran antakawaad or naksalwad ke mit jane yaa ruk jane kaa daawa bhi kar diya gaya
 Demonetisation was used for the first time in the world to eradicate terrorism and Naxalism
 fark ye aayaa he ki kaala dhan ab nae noton main pakadaa ja rahaa he
 Some people are still looking for a chip in 2000 note which is not there
 jabaki usee vakt reserve bank of india ne manaa kar diya tha ki note main is tarah kaa koi chip nahin he
 At that time, four hundred fifty thousand rupees of five hundred and thousand rupees were in circulation
 ye mantri santosh gangavar kaa bayaan tha
 Till date, the Reserve Bank of India could not tell how many 500 and 1000 notes came back after demonetisation
 haal hi main sansadeey samiti ke saamne rigerv bank ke governor urjit patel nahin bataa sake ki kitna note waapas aayaa he
 He says that the counting of notes is going on
 rigerv bank ne counting mashin kharidne ke liye tender nikaala he
 The governor told the parliamentary committee in January that the next time he would appear before the committee, he would tell how many notes were returned
 kitne note waapas aae hai yah jaananaa isliye zaruri he kyonki tabhi pataa chalegaa ki kitne nakli note yaa kaala dhan cirkulation main the
 If 14
 50 lakh karod hi aae to phir notebandi kaise safal kahi jaaegi
 To this, former Finance Minister p Chidambaram has quipped that after eight months of demonetisation, if the Reserve Bank is buying a counting machine, it could have taken at least a lease
 rahul gandhi ne chutki lete hue twit kiya he ki sarkaar ko maths teacher kii zarurat he, kisi ko piemo main applai kar dena chahie
 By the way, when the bank counts and takes notes from you, you will also count it to the Reserve Bank
 jab bainkon ne notebandi ke dauraan waapas kiye gaye note tabhi ke tabhi gin liye to ab tak rigerv bank kaise nahin gin paa rahaa he
 Can the Reserve Bank not tell that the banks have given so many notes on their behalf? ham apni taraf se ek or baar gin rahe hai
 Perhaps the Monkey Man phenomenon is not yet over
 bich bich main iske nae nae item aate rahete hai or ham logon ne har baar sabit kiya he ki afvaah kisi bhi ho, yakeen zarur karenge
 We have never disappointed the spread of rumors
 tippaniyan We still remember the lesson of drinking milk of Ganesha idol in 1995
 tabhi november 2016 main desh ke kai rajyon ke log dukaanon ke aage line main lag gaye ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 In this case people from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Hyderabad also did well with smaller cities
 whatsap se massej aayaa tha ki chini or namak kii killat hone vaali he
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav kept telling the rumor and instructed the District Magistrate to take strict action against those spreading the rumor
 kitni acchhee baat he ki failaane waalon ke liye sazaa he magar afvaah par yakeen karne waalon ke liye koi sazaa nahin

 Kapil Sharma was still in discussions with his show's TRP, Sunil Grover, about the fight and comedy
 lekin pichley kuch samay main unhen lekar ye baaten band ho gayi or focus ho gaya unki health par
 Fans were already upset over the health of Kapil Sharma, who had fainted thrice on the sets in the recent past
 sabhi dar rahe the ki kahin unako koi gambhir beemaari na ho
 In such a situation, the revelations of his sister have surprised everyone that she is a patient of depression
 is khabar se jahaan kapil sharma ke phans ko jhatka laga he vahiin sawaal ye bhi uth rahaa he ki aakhir kariyar kii res main kai logon ko peeche chhodane ke baavjood kapil sharma ko depressant hone kii vajah kya he?phir hone lagi charchaa, kya band ho jayega da kapil sharma shokapil ke kariyar or pichley kuch samay kii unase judi ghatnaon par ye najar daalen to unako depressant hone kii ye 5 vajahen saamne aati hai-parformens preshrakapil sharma ne colors channel kaa saath ek vivaadit mode par choda tha or jab soni se unki deal hui to TRP ko baat kai karod main tay hui
 But Kapil got a discussion with Sony but not a success like Comedy Nights with Kapil
 2016 main jab se da kapil sharma sho shuru hua he, tabhi se kapil sharma par tiarapy yani parformens pressure kaa dabaav tha
 As the years passed, the trps of Kapil Sharma's show went down drastically and the pressure on him to perform increased
 in dinon khabar he ki soni channel shaayad kapil sharma ke saath apana contract bhi aage naa badaye
 Coming down immediately after seeing the peak of success
 
 
 kapil sharma kya kisi ko bhi depress kar saktaa he
 With the TRP getting spoiled, the punch of Kapil Sharma's comedy is also getting dull
 vahiin lagaataar vivaad bhi kapil sharma ke saath jude hai
 Then, in his fight with Sunil Grover, it was also felt that Kapil Sharma has come into a bit of air
 aise main kaam or naam ke girane se kapil sharma ko apni image bigadane kii tension ho rahi hogi
 With the number of Struggles that Kapil has found, the problem of bad name can be big for him
 doston kaa chuta sathgin doston ke saath kapil sharma ne apana production house or apane sho kii shuruyaat kii, wo unase dur ho gaye
 After a fight with Sunil Grover, all his colleagues kept distance from him
 sunil grover hi nahin, ali asagar, chandan prabhakar jaise unke kareebi unase dur chale gaye
 Kapil Sharma may not have realized in the beginning, but later the feeling of missing friends will be felt later
 ho saktaa he ki ye sab feel hone par ab unako doston ke dur chale jane se depressant hota ho
 Sister Revealed- Comedian Kapil Sharma is struggling with depression
 Competition was a phase of comedy on the small screen
 lekin haal main ye sho khaas tiarapy nahin bator paa rahe hai
 At the moment, in the list of new shows, the mythological serials are doing better
 or kapil sharma kaa sho khud ko top 10 main bhi nahin rakh paa rahaa he
 Then in the coming time, many shows are also going to be against Kapil Sharma
 da drama company shuru ho chukaa he or kebisi ke promose aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, not seeing yourself in competition may also be a cause of depression for Kapil Sharma
 firangi par asarkis kis ko pyaar karun se bade parde par bhi safalataa kaa swaad lene vaale kapil sharma in dinon firangi kii shooting bhi kar rahe hai
 Their money is also invested in this
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki chote parde par apni harati baaji se unako ye lagane laga he ki kahin ye film bhi baith na jaae
 It may be that Kapil Sharma is upset even thinking this
 kapil ke sho main nahin aae bollywood sitare, shoot hua cansipub ye to hue prafational kaaran, jinaki vajah se kapil sharma depressant main ho sakate hai
 On the personal front, it may be that he had a fight with his girlfriend Ginny over something
 baharhaal, ham to yahi dua karenge ki kapil sharma kii life jaldi se apni comic lay dobaaraa pakade or is depressant se unako chuttee mili! Volkswagen introduced the t-roc during the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show

 But only when the news comes that Priyanka Gandhi will take charge of campaigning for the Congress in Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, where the Congressmen who are lying there have started giving their kurtas
 5 july ko jab narendra modi mantrimandal kaa vistaar ho rahaa tha, usee samay is khabar ne samachar channelon kii aadhi screen par kabja jamaa liya
 The Congress finally made a concrete decision
 During such a big promotion of the Modi government, the split of half-and-half between the Congress and the BJP was a new experience in the world of information broadcasting
 isaki vajah saaf thi ki dedh dashak kii hichak ke baad congress ne aakhir tay kar hi liya he ki uttar pradesh main phir se ubhare bina desh kii raajnneeti main danka bajaanaa naammumkin he
 And the party has now reached that point, when it cannot save Sanjeevani Booti for any other bad time
 kya he PK kii ranneeti?taaja ghatnakram kii patakatha tabhi se likhi ja rahi he, jab se prashanth kishor ko uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kaa manager banaaya gaya
 About three months ago, there were reports that Prashant Kishore had given the formula that Priyanka Gandhi should campaign for the Congress and present former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit as the face of the Chief Minister
 us samay ye baaten hawaii lagati thim, lekin 4 july ko uttar pradesh congress ke nae prabharee gulam nabi aaazaad ne 10 janpath par sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ke saath lambii mulaakaat kii
 The meeting continued the next day too
 iske baad aaazaad ne kaha, 'ham sab chaahate hai kipriyanka gandhiutar pradesh main congress kaa prachaar karen
 However, he himself has to take a final decision in this regard
 yah khabar galat he ki priyanka gandhi uttar pradesh chunaav abhiyaan cameti kii pramukh bana di gai hai
 'azad has been put forward as incharge, in fact, it is a comprehensive strategy part of the Congress
 congress sutron kii maane to uttar pradesh chunaav main prashanth kishor kii bhoomika usase kahin badi hone ja rahi he, jitani vah abhi najar aati he
 Azad has been sent to UP as a trusted Muslim face under Prashant's formula
 party ke duusare muslim chehre salmaan khurshid kuch din pehle achaanak twitor plateform par utre or bijepi ke khilaaf dhuandhar morcha khol diya
 Preparations to change the face of the state organization Apart from this, soon Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee President Nirmal Khatri will be given some other responsibility
 faijabad se saansad rahe khatri acharya narendra dev ke naati hai or gandhi parivaar ke behad kareebi hai, lekin prashanth ke jatigat formule main ve feet nahin baith rahe hai
 The strategy of the Congress is to attract both Brahmins and Muslims
 vaise, priyanka ke prachaar maidan main utarane kii sambhaavna se khatri utsahit hai, 'priyanka pradesh main chunaav prachaar karengi to janata or kaaryakarta, donon main nayaa josh aayega
 Big bet on Sheila Dixit? The matter of sending Sheila Dixit to UP has been confirmed
 khud dikshit ne kaha, ''pehle main is baat ko lekar pasopesh main thi ki samay bahut kam bachaa he
 But whatever order the party will give, i will follow it
 '' lekin congress jaldbaaji main nahin he
 Before bringing Priyanka to the stage, the Congress wants to see the strength of the ground by banging

 Under this, each contender has to email his bio data to Prashant's team along with the list of booth representatives
 iske baad prashanth kii team sambandhit daavedaar se phone par baat karegi
 In many cases, claimants are also being asked to come to Lucknow with all their booth representatives, so that they can be trained
 is puri kavayad se prashanth har booth par congress ke liye kam se kam aath-das samarthakon kaa data bank taiyaar kar lenaa chaahate hai jo chunaav abhiyaan ko jamini banane main madad karegaa
 a senior leader of the Uttar Pradesh Congress said that the truth is that apart from one hundred and fifty seats, the Congress does not have the candidates in the same manner
 aise main koi kahe yaa na kahe, vahaan prashanth kishor kii bhoomika hi sabase ahm he
 His team will speak over 1,000 people from the assembly constituency over the phone about the three names of the panel
 jis pratyaashee ko sabase zyada log thik bataaenge, use hi tikat diya jayega
 'congress is trying to finalize the names of the candidates by August
 yani priyanka ke maidan main aane se pehle congress ke paas apane booth agenton kii 'jinda' suchi hogi or har vidhansabha main kaaryakartaaon kaa bada data base hoga
 This thing is happening in the party after a long time
 priyanka ke aane sexryakarta utsahitvaranasi se purv saansad rajesh mishra se india today ne jab poocha ki priyanka aa bhi jaaengi to is kamjor congress ko jilaayengi kaise, to mishra ne kaha, 'congress kabhi kader base party nahin rahi he, congress maas base party he
 The party has not been in power for a long time, so many of our leaders have moved here and there
 sapa, bispi or bijepi main aakhir hamaare puraane netaaon ke parivaar hi to hai
 If Priyanka comes out, the public will come after the Congress and you will see that many people will return to the party
 asal baat yah he ki congress kaa maahaul banegaa
 'mishra is the kind of leader who can fit both the caste and the energy in the formula formulated by Prashant Kishore for the state president
 shahari matadaataaon par zyada asarparty maanakar chal rahi he ki priyanka ke aane kaa sabase zyada asar shahari matadaata par dikhegaa
 Incidentally, these seats have traditionally been dominated by the BJP
 yani in siton par paaramparik vot ke saath hi priyanka ke aane se aayaa utsaah or brahman-muslim sameekaran milakar congress kii kismat badal sakate hai
 Aiming to win 100 seats, the Congress, which won only 28 out of 405 seats in the last assembly election, is aiming to win 100 seats this time
 agar chunaav chautarafa hua to congress kam vot hasil karke bhi paryaapt siten hasil kar sakati he
 But in the bitter electoral mood of the state, the politics divided among the castes of the castes and the inter-communal experiments that take place, will the Congress weapon really remain unaffordable? america doping rodhi agency (uasaidie) ke pramukh trevis tigart ne kaha he ki lans armastrang ne opera vinfre ko die intervyuu main jhooth bolaa or agar yah cyclist apane aaajeevan pratibandh ko kam karnaa chahta he, to puri tarah sahyog karne ke liye uske paas 6 farvari tak kaa samay he

 Of all the events unfolding in the episode of # metoo, the incident that happened to him is probably the most frightening
 vinta nanda ne apane fasebuk pej par ghatana kaa silsilewar byoraa diya he
 In his post, he has mentioned the actor who played the lead role in the famous TV serial 'tara' of the 90s and identified as 'sanskari' in the industry and accused him of sexual exploitation
 vinta nanda ke is post ke baad soshal media par tamaam log alok nath kaa naam le rahe hai, jinhen aksar 'sanskari abhinayta' bhi kaha jaataa he or un par karrwai kii maang kar rahe hai
 The comments vinta nanda ne apni post main aarope lagaaya he ki abhinayta ne kathith taur par unke saath rape kiya or isse pehle usne dharawahik 'tara' kii lead actress navaneet nishaan ke saath bhi budtamiji kii
 However he did not mention Navneet Nishan in his post
 unhone aage likhaa he, abhinayta kaa vyavhaar iske baad or kharaab hota chalaa gaya he or nanda or production ke anya sahyogiyon ne abhinayta ko hataane kaa man bana liya he
 Later, due to channel pressure, 'tara' was discontinued and other shows of Nanda were canceled

 According to him, the actor raped and beat her in his house

 He further wrote, 'ironically, the person who is actually an animal is known by the name of' Sanskari 'in the industry'

 Politics is still continuing on the Pulwama attack that emerged as the biggest issue before the Lok Sabha elections
 khaas baat ye he ki aaj jari paanchaven charan ke matdaan main pulavama main bhi vot daale ja rahe hai
 a blast occurred at the polling booth of Pulwama during the voting
 yahaan rohmu poling booth par grenade phenkaa gaya
 About 1 after this blast
 30 baje doosraa blast hua, haalanki kisi ko chot pahunchane kii report nahin ai
 Today, votes are being cast in 51 seats in the country, including Ladakh and Anantnag seats in Jammu and Kashmir
 anantnag main aane vaale pulavama main somvaar subah se hi matadaataaon kii bheed poling booth par dikhi
 It has been more than two months since the Pulwama attack, but the voters here have come to celebrate democracy by giving a befitting reply to terrorism
 pulavama ne badla chunavi muddapulavama main isi saal 14 farvari ko jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankiyon ne siarpief ke kafile par hamalaa kiya tha, jisamen desh ke 40 jawan shahid ho gaye the
 After this attack there was anger in the country and Pulwama had come to the center of politics at once
 rashtrawaad ke mudde par vot maang rahi bijepipulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bharat kii vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main airstrike kii thi or jiske baad rashtrawaad kaa mudda ahm ho gaya tha
 While the ruling party Bharatiya Janata Party is seeking votes in the country on the issue of nationalism, the opposition is attacking the BJP on the Pulwama terror attack and the electoral use of Airstrike
 vipaksh ne modi sarkaar par saadhaa nishanaayek taraf pulavama ke baad jahaan bijepi rashtrawaad ke mudde par aage bad rahi thi, to vahiin vipaksh main kai awaazen aisi bhi sunai deen jahaan netaaon ne modi sarkaar par hi pulavama kaa aarope madh diya
 Former Jammu and Kashmir CM Farooq Abdullah also said several times that Pulwama should be investigated
 tabhi se pulavama bhartiya raajnneeti ke centre main tha or aaj jab matdaan ho rahaa he to voter hansi-khushi bad maatra main vot daalane nikle hai
 Let us tell you that Pulwama falls in Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency, where by-elections were to be held in 2014 but could not be held due to security reasons
 is baar bhi kai charnon main vahaan matdaan puraa kiya ja rahaa he
 Actually, Anantnag Lok Sabha is one of the largest seats in the country
 is kshetra main traal, shopiyaan, devsar, pampor, nurabad, doru, pahalgam, vaachi, pulavama, kulgaam, kokarnag, bijabehaara, rajapora, homashalibug, shangus, anantnag jaise chote-bade gaanv or kasbe aate hai
 The number of voters here is more than 13 lakhs
 chunaav kii har khabar milegi sidhe aapke inbox main
 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to Aaj Tak's election special news letter agar aap kabhi bhi arenjd marij date par gaye hai yaa jane vaale hai to isse pehle yah video jarur dekh lijie
 The trend of arranged marriage concept and matrimonial date is increasing in Indian society
 date par zyaadaatar aisa hota he ki ladkaa saath ai ladki ko gyaan detaa he ki use shaadi ke baad kya karnaa chahie or kya nahin karnaa chahie
 a video has been made on the ghostly matrimonial date in a white sari on the streets of Delhi, which will make you loot
 lekin yah video ek bahut jaruri massej bhi detaa he
 In Delhi, a boy and girl meet on a metrimonial date
 ladki genes shart pahanakar ai hoti he, to ladkaa usase kahata he ki ladakiyon kaa shaadi ke baad genes, skirt pahananaa ajeeb lagata
 My husband made me a prostitute, the video goes viral, then on the girl's job, the boy says that i earn a lot, you will not have to work
 mummy or bhabhi ke saath ghar ke kaamon main haath bantaana, or aaraam se rahanaa
 After listening to this, the girl says, 'there is not much hobby but there is a hobby which i cannot leave
 ' ladki ladke se kahati he ki use padnaa bahut pasand he
 After this, the way she shows that boy the land is fantastic
 dekhie puraa videoh In the three big riots of the country during the year and a half, some things were very common
 pehali maamuli vajah, duusari kisi netaa kaa role or teesri, bade raajnneetik laabh par najar
 Look at Muzaffarnagar (UP), Trilokpuri (delhi) and now Muzaffarpur in Bihar
 
 
 1
 a minor reason - Muzaffarnagar riots in Uttar Pradesh started a year and a half ago with a molestation incident
 ek hindu jat chaatra ko skool jate samay raste main kuch muslim yuvak pareshaan karte the
 When his two brothers went to take objection to this, both were killed
 or phir mujffarnagar-saharanpur jal uthe
 - Riots occurred in Trilokpur, Delhi, immediately after Diwali last year
 kaaran sirf itnaa tha ki yahaan ek masjid ke paas ek asthai chabutare mata kii chaowkee par laudspikar baj rahaa tha
 Due to which there was trouble in Namaz
 - or ab bihar kaa mujffarpur, jahaan prem prasang main ek hindu yuvak kii uski muslim premika ke bhai ne kathith taur par hatya kar di
 And after that the angry mob started retaliation
 chaar shav mil chuke hai or kai logon ke laapata hone kii khabaren hai
 2
 aag main ghi daalane vaale- mujffarnagar ke kawal main hatya hone ke baad ek ore jat samudaay ne panchayat kii to duusari ore shuukravaar kii namaaj hone ke baad muslim samudaay masjid ke baahar jamaa ho gaya
 On both occasions, leaders of political parties made inflammatory statements
 - trilokapuri main mata kii chaowkee par vivaad hone ke baad shaam ko kathith taur par sthaneey bhaajapa netaa sunil vaidya ke daftar par ek gupt baithak hui
 After the meeting was over, all the people came out shouting slogans
 or isi ke thik baad vahaan dange shuru ho gaye the
 But, the news of a Hindu youth falling in love with Muzaffarpur and then missing from the Muslim community in Muzaffarpur
 abhi yah pataa nahin chalaa he ki is bheed kii koi aguwai bhi kar rahaa tha kya? kyonki, laash milte hi hajaaron logon kii bheed kaa aagjanee par utaaru ho janaa swaabhaavik nahin lag rahaa
 3
 
 
 
 And politics- riots in Muzaffarnagar were also linked to electoral politics
 kuch samay baad hi loksabhaa ke chunaav hone the
 In such a situation, polarization of votes was beneficial for some parties in Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in the country
 congress or samaajawaadee party, jahaan muslim votbank ko hathiyaane main lagi rahi hai
 The BJP was eyeing the Hindu vote
 nateeja bhi apekshit hi aayaa
 BJP won all ten seats in this area
 - trilokapuri ke dangon ke peeche bhi politics ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya gaya
 Sunil Vaidya, an MLA from here, lost the last election to the Aam Aadmi Party candidate
 yah danga bhadakaane ke liye un par hi aarope laga ki aisa unhone apni raajnneetik jameen ko waapas paane ke liye kiya
 Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi returned from Mumbai after the Muzaffarpur conflict
 sarkaar ke sahyogi laluprasad yadav puure samay police afasaron se sidhe baat kar rahe hai
 Because this year Bihar assembly elections are going to be held
 dange bhadke to vot bantega
 If JDU and RJD are eyeing Muslim votes then BJP will attract Hindu votes again
 madhya pradesh ke skulon kii english main ab sudhaar kiya ja rahaa he

 uske is kaam main bacchon ke liye kaam karne vaali sanstha unicef sahyog karegi

 abhi praayogic taur par ujjain sambhag ke sabhi jilon main praathmik skulon ke shikshakon ko english kaa prashikshan diya jayega

 3 paise prati minute kaa ijapha hoga
 m Karunanidhi, who was a major pillar of Tamil Nadu politics, said goodbye to the world and the saga of struggle left behind, which changed the state's politics
 purvi tamilnadu ke ek saadhaaran se parivaar main paidaa hue karunanidhi ne garibi kii vajah se sirf aathvin tak kii padhai kii
 After this he stepped into politics
 tamilnadu kii siyasat badalane vaale karunanidhi kii raajnneeti khud vivaadon main ghiri rahi
 However, he did not lapse into any stage of life
 jayalalita or karunanidhi kaa vivadazyalalita or karunanidhi ke bich raajnneetik pratidwandita jagajaahir he
 In 1989, the incident of insulting Jayalalithaa in front of the then Chief Minister Karunanidhi in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly served to increase personal disharmony in the state's politics
 kuch saalon baad jab jayalalita mukhyamantri baniin to unhone ek maamle main aadhi raat ko karunanidhi ko neend main uthaakar hawalat main dalava diya tha
 This picture was seen by the whole country, how Karunanidhi was screaming in front of the police in cluttered clothes
 altitii se rishte par uthe sawalaltitii se unke rishte ne bhi kai sawaal khadey kiye
 Former Prime Minister Chandrasekhar had said that he sacked the Karunanidhi government in 1991 due to his links with the LTTE
 aaj chandrashekhar sarkaar main mantri rahe subramanyam swami kuch is tarah karunanidhi ko yaad karte hai - karunanidhi ne apni sharton par raajnneeti kii
 He was accused of corruption and dynasty, but amid these allegations, he returned to the pavilion after playing his innings
 bas shatak se chah kadam dur rah gaye
 The friend made a distance, childhood was lost in poverty, but youth was encouraged and that is why Karunanidhi touched that step of success
 yah kisi filmi kahani kii tarah lagata he
 The film story recalled that Tamil film superstar MG Ramachandran was once Karunanidhi's friend and considered him his leader
 haalanki kuch samay baad emji ramchandran ne bhrashtachar or vanshavaad kaa aarope lagaakar unase duuri bana lee
 After this, the politics of Tamil Nadu changed
 darasal, emji ramchandran ne diemke se alag hokar ediemke bana lee or tamilnadu ke mukhyamantri bhi bane
 Due to poverty, the education of Karunanidhi could be gauged from the fact that after the eighth he had to leave his studies
 iske baad wo raajnneeti main gaye, lekin iske samaantar tamil filmon kii taraf bhi mude, jahaan inaki likhi script par bani filmein kamyaabi ke jhande gaadne lageen
 He was a scholar who wrote more than 100 books and films on those stories, despite not passing his tenth pass
 in filmon main emji ramchandran kii adaakaari ne unako superstar bana diya, lekin jab apni pehali patni padmavati se bete muthu ko filmon main badhanaa chaha, to bete kii film nahin chali
 At the same time, his relations with MGR also deteriorated
 teen shaadiyaan kii karunanidhi nekarunanidhi kii raajnneeti kaa vistaar jitna zyada tha, utana hi unki filmon kaa bhi vistaar tha or utana hi unke parivaar kaa bhi
 The veteran face of Tamil politics and film had three weddings and had six children
 lekin javaani ke dinon main adarsh itnaa haaavee tha ki apni premika se apane usulon ke kaaran shaadi nahin kii
 In 1944, when Karunanidhi was 20 years old, Karunanidhi wanted to marry his girlfriend, but his girlfriend's family members were not ready to back down from marrying the traditional way
 paramparaagat tarika yani mantrocchar or mangalsutra vagairah
 Karunanidhi considered it hypocrisy and that is why he was not ready
 nateeja ye hua ki dilruba ruthi or rishta tut gaya

 ' tivi kii duniya se brake le chuke kapil sharma ne bade parde par vaapasi kii he

 ’’ In the 2G spectrum case, CBI will on Saturday file the first chargesheet of about 80,000 pages against former Telecom Minister a Raja and several of his close associates with attachments
 raja ke alaava unke kai sahyogiyon or kai real estate companiyon ke khilaaf aaropapatr daayar hona he
 They are accused of allegedly criminal conspiracy to harm the treasury and get a telecom license
 sutron ne bataaya ki aaropon kii pehali suchi main kai bade audyogic gharaanon ke naam bhi aa sakate hai, jinke ghotaale main laabh paane waalon ke saath kathith sambandh hai
 The second list of charges can be given in the supplementary chargesheet, which is likely to be filed later this month
 sibiai ne ucchtam nyaayalay ko bataaya he ki raja ke kaarykaal ke dauraan sthapit doorsanchaar companiyon ne avaidh rup se 2 ji spectrum paane ke liye swaan telecom or loop telecom doorsanchaar companiyon kaa mukhute kii tarah istemaal kiya
 The agency had said in court that Raja would face charges of 'fraud, forgery and corruption'
 sibiai ne adaalat ke saamne kaha ki swaan or loop ne spectrum paane ke liye apni companiyon ke bare main vivaran chipaaya or ye companiyaan ‘dhokhadhadi or aapraadhik sajeesh’ ke aarope kaa saamana karengi
 The agency told the court that during Raja's tenure there was also evidence of 'fraud' by changing the policy of first-come-first-served to provide 2G spectrum to many companies
 haalanki sibiai ke sutron ke mutabik rajkosh ko hua nuksaan aaropapatr main shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki bhartiya doorsanchaar niamak praadhikaran (tri) ko abhi is aavanton main hue nuksaan kaa akalan karnaa bachaa he
 This charge sheet will be filed in the special court of Justice OP Saini
 sibiai ne pichley saal nyaayalay ko bataaya tha ki vah 31 march tak pehla aaropapatr daayar kar degi, jisamen is maamle kii agency or pravartan nideshaalay dwaara kii gai jaanch ke bare main bhi jaankaree hogi
 The CBI then asked for two more days for this
 sambhaavna vyakt kii ja rahi he ki sibiai pehla aaropapatr daayar karne ke baad adaalat se is maamle main jaanch jari rakhane kii anumati maange
 According to sources, apart from Raja, his personal assistant RK Chandolia, former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura, former managing director of Etisalat DB (formerly Swan Telecom) Shahid Osman Balwa and an MP can be named in the chargesheet
 ram sethu ko rashtriya smarak ghoshit karne yaa na karne ke mudde par supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko apana paksh rakhane ke liye or vakt diya he
 Significantly, the Central Government had demanded more time from the Supreme Court for a decision on this issue
 jise manjuur kar liya gaya
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had asked the government to clear its stand on the issue
 darasal 2007 main madras hai court kaa darwaja khatkhataakar janata party ke adhyaksh subramanyam swami ne ram sethu ko rashtriya dharohar ghoshit kiye jane kii maang kii thi jiske baad puraa vivaad supreme court pahunch gaya
 According to Swamy, the central government has neither responded to this demand nor conducted any such study in the last 4 years
 lihaaja swami ne ek baar phir ram sethu ko rashtriya dharohar ghoshit karne kaa mudda court main uthaaya
 Two days ago, a bench headed by Justice HL Dattu asked senior counsel Harish Rawal, appearing for the central government, to clarify his stand in the court after consulting the government
 aaj supreme court main sarkaar ko jawaab dena tha
 Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha has written a letter to the Prime Minister demanding that Ram Setu be declared a national heritage
 jayalalita ne kaha he ki ram sethu ke puraatatv, aitihaasik or saanskrithik mahatv ke chalate pichhali baar jataai gai aapattiyon ko dekhte hue ve apil karti hai ki centre sarkaar bina der kiye ram sethu ko rashtriya smarak ghoshit karne kii disha main kadam uthaaegi
 Where is Ram Setu? Ram Sethu is in the maritime part connecting India and Sri Lanka
 rameswaram or mannar dweep ke bich chooney kii uthali chattaanon kii ek shrinkhalaa dikhaai padati he
 It is believed that this is the mythical Ram Setu, which the world knows as Adams Bridge
 kuch saal pehle satellite se liye gaye chitron main bhi dwipon kii ek patali rekha dikhaai padati he, jiske bare main daawa kiya jaataa he ki ye ram sethu hi he
 What is the danger on Ram Setu? In 2005, the Central Government approved the Setu Samudram Shipping Channel Project
 is project ke tahat ram sethu ke kuch ilaake ko gaharaa kiya janaa he, taaki vahaan jahaaj aasaani se chal saken
 Obviously, this project will harm the mythical Ram Setu
 or isi baat ko lekar project kaa virodh ho rahaa he
 The committee headed by environmental expert RK Pachauri has been tasked to find out if the shipping canal of the Sethusamudram project can be built by another route without damaging the Ram Setu? The Supreme Court has also extended the period of 6 weeks to submit the report of this committee
 centre ne diya tha vivaadit halafanamakendre sarkaar iske pehle court main ye halafanama dekar vivaad main funs chuki he ki ram sethu ke bare main wo puranic kahaniyon ko aitihaasik dastavej nahin maan sakati
 However, the disputed affidavit was later withdrawn

 Former Indian captain Rahul Dravid called Australia's decision to keep Nathan Lyon out of the ongoing second Test match in Hyderabad as a strategic lapse
 australian team prabandhan kii leone ko hataakar unke sthaan par jevier doharty or glen maxwell ko team main rakhane ke liye kadi aalochana ho rahi he
 Dravid believes that this decision could cause Australia to lose the second Test in Hyderabad
 dravid ne kaha, ‘maaikel clark ko jis sabase badi ranneetik chook ke liye jimmedaari leni hogi vah nathan leone ko baahar rakhane kaa faisla he
 He said, 'they choose their team very cleverly
 leone chennai main bhartiya team par haaavee nahin ho paaya lekin usne vahaan visheshkar duusari pari main acchhee gendbaaji kii thi
 He seemed to be gaining confidence
 ’dravid ne kaha, ‘bharat aakar is tarah ke viketon par bhartiya ballebaajon ke liye gendbaaji karnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 Whatever confidence Nathan Lyon had gained in that Test match, he must have been shaken
 ’dravid kaa maananaa he ki yadi bhartiya spinner apni kshamta ke anusaar pradarshan karte hai to phir vartmaan test match jaldi samaapt ho jayega
 He said, 'australia is playing a compromising attitude in Test matches because it does not have a good spinner who can keep pressure on India all day
 match chauthe din hi samaapt ho saktaa he
 Dravid said, "when Indian spinners bowl, it looks like a completely different kind of wicket
 australia ke liye bahut mushkil hogi
 Chennai seemed to have some competition but here in the first two days, India beat Australia in every department
 ’unhone kaha, ‘australian spinner bhartiya ballebaajon par kisi bhi samay dabaav nahin daal paye jabaki bhartiya spinneron ne australian ballebaajon par har samay dabaav banaaye rakhaa tha

 He emphasized that the Finance Ministry provides' considerable funds' to the Ministry of Defense and 'I hope that the Defense Forces will learn a lesson from this and ensure that the money allocated to them is spent on necessary matters and with prudence

 enesayuai kii is sadasya ne daawa kiya tha ki vah us durghatana main mrit ek nausainik adhikari kii bahan he
 At an event organized by NSUI here, the woman said that Lt Commander Kapish Muwal, who was killed in the INS Sindhuratna accident, was his brother

 To this Chidambaram said, 'as far as defense spending is concerned, i think it would not be right to say that sufficient funds are not being provided

 It seems that there were some problems with the batteries that caused the submarine to catch fire
 ' Although Chidambaram has insisted that considerable funds are made available to the defense forces, sources in the Ministry of Defense said that the Finance Ministry cut its budgetary allocation by more than Rs 7,800 crore for modernization for the current financial year

 Congress's problems in Haryana and Maharashtra Ashok tanwar-sanjay Nirupam The path of rebellion Parhariana - As the election of Maharashtra assembly elections is increasing, as the bjp-shiv Sena are getting stronger, the Congress's difficulties are increasing
 
 donon rajyon main congress ke tikat vitaran ko lekar haryana ke purv pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar or purv mumbai adhyaksh sanjay nirupam ne baghawat kaa kaa jhanda buland kar diya he
 In such a situation, these two leaders have increased the problem of the Congress party already going through bad times
 darasal ashok tanvar ne tikat ke liye apane paanch darjan samarthakon kii suchi congress haikaman ko saunpi thi, jise puri tarah se nazarandaaj kar diya gaya he
 Tanwar wanted that his supporters who were associated with him for five years also got tickets, but due to Bhupendra Singh Hooda, none of his supporters got tickets
 apane samarthakon kii andekhi se naaraaz congress ke purv pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ne party ke sabhi padon se istipha de diya
 Ashok Tanwar alleged that Haryana Congress is now making 'hooda Congress'
 unhone daawa kiya, 'jinhone paanch saal tak khun-pasinaa bahaya, lekin tikat vitaran main unki andekhi kii gai
 The leadership also wanted this but some people have vested interests, they do not want new people to come
 jab bijepi maujuuda vidhayakon ke tikat kaat sakati he to ham kyon nahin? naaraaz ashok tanvar ne haryana main congress ke liye prachaar nahin karne ke sanket bhi de die hai
 The Congress in Maharashtra was already going through the challenges of preserving its existence
 aise main congress ke tikat vitaran ko lekar maharashtracongress ke diggaj netaa sanjay nirupamparty se naaraaz ho gaye hai or party chhodane kii dhamkee bhi de di he
 Sanjay Nirupam said that i had recommended a candidate, but he too has not been given a ticket
 sanjay nirupam ne kaha, 'aisa lagata he ki congress party ab meri sevaayen nahin chaahati he
 i recommended just one name for the assembly elections in Mumbai
 suna he ki ise bhi khaarij kar diya gaya he
 As i told the leadership earlier, in that case i will not participate in the election campaign
 yah meraa antim nirnay he
 Not only this, Sanjay Nirupam tweeted and wrote, 'I hope the time will not come for the party to say goodbye, but the way the leadership is treating me, it seems that the day is not far off
 'vahiin, duusari taraf bijepi ne haryana or maharashtra main apane ek darjan vidhayakon or kai mantriyon tak tikat kaat die hai
 In Haryana, many Congress ministers and mps were demanding tickets for their family members, but the party has not given them tickets
 iske baavjood bijepi main kisi tarah kii koi baghawat nahin dekhne ko mili
 However, the angry leaders of the party did the work of persuading the big leaders of the BJP
 isi kaa nateeja he ki bijepi donon rajyon main majbootee ke saath chunavi maidan main najar aa rahi he
 At the same time, no major leader has even met to convince both of his disgruntled leaders in the Congress
 jabaki ashok tanvar or sanjay nirupam congress ke purv adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke kareebi maane jate hai
 Not only this, they also have their own base in their respective states

 If you are thinking of going to the gym to lose weight, then stop
 ek baar phir sochie! 'da fast diet' ke sah lekhak or 5:2 aahaar ke sutaradhar maaikel muusale kaa daawa he ki vyaayaam se vastav main na to vajan kam hota he or na hi mood main sudhaar hota he
 During a program on a UK television channel, he said that most people think that if you exercise, you can eat the food you want and in this way the gym also helps to keep you happy
 unhone kaha ki lekin yah sahi nahin he
 Mousle said that exercise is the right way to stop weight gain and not to reduce weight
 vah isaki vyakhya karte hue kehete hai ki vyaayaam calories ko kam karne main utana sahaayak nahin he, log jitna samajhate hai
 According to the Daily Mail, Mousle wrote that one pound (about half a kilogram) of fat contains 3,500 calories of energy
 is tarah isamen dynamite se bhi adhik urja hoti he
 Thus to burn one pound of fat you need 38 miles (61

 The condition of the roads of Bihar were sleeping, but that statement of Lalu had become a matter of discussion everywhere
 shivaraj ne bhi madhya pradesh kii sadakon kii tulana washington disi kii sadakon se kar daali
 Compare what the roads of Madhya Pradesh were better than the streets of Washington
 shivaraj bane uphaas ke paatrub aisa bayaan diya to us par har taraf se twarit pratikriya aani hi thi
 The first thing to be talked about is what a common man has to say on this statement

 Cooperation Minister of Madhya Pradesh Vishwas Sarang has come out in defense of Chief Minister Chauhan
 saarang kehete hai, "mukhyamantri ke bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya ja rahaa he

 unka kehane kaa matlab yah tha ki madhya pradesh jab viksit rajya ban jayega to isaki sadaken washington kii sadakon se bhi behatar ho jaaengi
 "sarang also said that Scindia should not do politics on this issue and don't forget that Chauhan was representing the state, not the BJP, in America

 The day M
 e
 The last paper was, there was a strike on something suddenly in Rajasthan Roadways and unaware of this, i kept waiting for the bus going to Sirohi sitting at Sumerpur bus stand
 paper das baje se tha or sumerpur se bas se sirohi pahunchane main kam se kam ek ghanta lagata tha
 i inquired when it was a quarter past nine and no bus arrived
 hadtaal kaa pataa chalaa to main thodaa ghabaraaya lekin abhi trakon kii ummid baaki thi
 i walked from the bus stand to the octroi because there was a high probability of getting the truck from there
 jab paune das baje tak koi trek nahin dikhaai diya to maine sochaa ki ugamraj yaa doctor purohit ko phone karke anurodh kiya jaae ki vah apni motorcycle par mujhe sirohi chhod den
 On the other hand, Bhargava Saheb, Durga Prasad ji and my other friends in Sirohi were getting upset that the paper started so late and Prakash himself has no idea
 isi samay ek jarjar trek dhimi gati se aata dikhaai diya
 Giving my hand, the truck stopped, he was also Sirohi, he seated me but on the way stood in front of a dhaba in Paldi village
 driver -khalasi ne bataaya ki vah khaanaa khaaenge
 i folded my hands and explained to them that i have an exam, if i do not reach on time, then my whole year will be spoiled, so today if i eat food in Sirohi instead of Paldi, from my side, it would be very kind
 unhone meri baat kaa koi jawaab nahin diya or mujhe vahiin chhod dhabas main ghus gaye
 In desperation, i came on the highway and started to hand over the vehicles as i walked
 kuch der baad vahi jarjar trek aayaa or khalasi ne aawaaj lagaai, "chaliye"
 i could not understand what happened and where was the time to understand? i quickly climbed into the truck
 driver ne trek aise bhagaaya ki main baar-baar daahine -baayen girane laga lekin saadhe gyaarah baje usne mujhe sirohi ke teen batti chauraahey par utaar diya
 The college was about fifteen minutes from here
 aamtaur par chaar-paanch auto is chauraahey par hameshaa khadey milte hai lekin us din ek bhi nahin tha
 i used to walk fast and race intermittently, gasp and camper and reached the college at quarter to twelve
 durga prasad ji apni invijilation duty chhodkar main get par khadey meraa rasta dekh rahe the
 On seeing me, he kicked in his blue Vijay Super scooter and without asking me a single word, he took me to the examination hall
 vahaan fouran mujhe copy-paper pakadaaya gaya or ankhon ke saamne pehle prashn ke kuch shabd aate hi main uskaa uttar likhane laga
 After some time Bhargava Saheb came and Hasmalloom came to me walking among all the examinees and stayed for a minute, gently put his hand on my back
 ek aadmi ko banane main kis-kis vyakti kaa kaisaa-kaisaa yogadan rahata he
 It would not have been easy for Bhargava Saheb to allow any candidate to enter the examination at ten o'clock at twelve o'clock
 or un driver yaa khalasi kaa aabhaar kaise vyakt kiya jaae jinhone meri khatir apana khaanaa chhod diya
