 Rayudu said on Wednesday on the eve of the team's final round-robin match against Afghanistan, he is learning a lot from Dhoni bhai
 pakistan ke khilaaf usne shandaar kaam kiya
 We are losing, but we are putting a lot of effort
 unhone kaha, ham kaaphi kuch sikh rahe hai or jaisaa ki aapane dekha hamane jo match ganvaae vah kaaphi kareebi the
 We are working hard and as a cricketer we can do just that
 bangladesh par tikin bharat kii ummideshgar bangladesh gat champion pakistan ko aaj haraakar ulatpher kar detaa he to bharat ko afghanistan ko bonus ank ke saath haraakar final main jagah banane kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 Rayudu said, we will try to win tomorrow with bonus points and then let us see what happens
 hamaara dhyaan sirf bonus ank ke saath jeetne par tikaa he
 We will assess the situation after today's match
 unhone kaha, bangladesh kii team kii gendbaaji kaaphi acchhee he, jaisaa ki hamane pratiyogita main dekha he
 We just have to concentrate on scoring runs
 dhime wicket kaa ronaa royarayudu ne pakistan ke khilaaf 62 gend main 58 ran kii pari kheli or ravindra jadeja (49 gend main naabad 52) ke saath milakar team kaa score aath wicket par 245 ran tak pahunchane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 India had almost registered a win but Shahid Afridi hit two consecutive sixes in Ravindran Ashwin's final over to give Pakistan a crucial one-wicket victory
 lagaataar do maichon main shikast ke bare main rayudu ne kaha, agar aap maichon par dhyaan do to mujhe lagata he ki sabhi tiimon ko bich ke aawaron main sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he kyonki wicket dhimaa he or gend thodaa rukkar aa rahi he
 Rayudu said, there are a lot of wickets falling, so we have to play with stick and in the end the innings score is 250 runs instead of 350 runs
 lekin ham antim gend tak ja rahe hai
 It is not that we are not scoring
 sabhi tiimon ke saath aisa hi he
 The Indian batsman said that there is no doubt that the pitch is slow but as a professional he should not complain
 rayudu ke saamne yuvaraj singh or suresh raina jaise khilaadiyon kii jagah bharne kii jimmedaari he
 On this, he said that he will gain confidence by scoring a half-century in a pressure match like india-pakistan
 We are doing well
 In the Asia Cup, Rayudu said, i think i am learning with each match
 pichley match se mujhe kaaphi aatmavishvaas mila kyonki main kaaphi dabaav kii sthiti main khelaa
 We lost wickets and the indo-pak match is always played under a lot of pressure
 mujhe khushi he ki ham aisa score banane main safal rahe jiskaa hamane lagbhag bachaav kar liya tha
 Asked about the poor middle-order performance in Bangladesh after the tours of South Africa and New Zealand, Rayudu said, "I am not sure about New Zealand but i can talk about the Asia Cup
" ham acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 i think the scores we scored were less than anywhere
 isi maheene hone vaali vishwa tii20 championships main rayudu kii jagah suresh raina lenge or unhone aagaamee toornament ke liye bhartiya team ko shubhakamanaayen di

 BJP rebel leader Shatrughan Sinha has attacked the central government regarding PNB Mahaghotale
 purv film abhinayta sinha ne kaha he ki is maamle par kanoon mantri se lekar raksha mantri tak sab bol rahe hai, par jinhen bolnaa chahie, vah chup hai
 Shatrughan said that the Finance Ministry or PMO should speak on this matter
 piem ko bolnaa chahie, puraa desh unhen sunanaa chahta he
 i pray to the Finance Minister and the PM to open their mouths on this matter
 unhone aage kaha, 'jab neerav daavos main photo khinchvaa rahaa tha to kya piemo so rahaa tha? ghotaale main hamaare kuch apane shaamil hai
 Because of this, scamsters are encouraged
 ' sinha ne iske saath hi kaha ki jitani rakam kaa ghotaalaa neerav modi ne kiya he, us rakam se lakhon kisaanon ko karj maafee di ja sakati thi
 Sinha said that the bank is helping the rich, but the poor are crushed under debt
 sinha ne kahaahe ki sarkaar ko apni kami sweekaar kerani chahie
 This case should be thoroughly and properly investigated
 agar sarkari adhikari isamen shaamil hai to unhen isaki jimmedaari leni chahie
 Earlier, Bhishtrughan Sinha had also tweeted severally on this matter
 ek twit main unhone likhaa tha ki bada chaukeedaar so gaya, chota damdaar so gaya or ham sab dekhte rah gaye
 Shatrughan Sinha's attack on the central government is not new
 vah notebandi se lekar jiesti tak piem narendra modi, vitt mantri arun jetali or bijepi ke aantarik maamalon par party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah par aksar hamalaa bolte rahete hai
 When India and Australia are face to face in the third Test from Friday, the Indian batsmen will have to take an aggressive look in front of the fast bowling table in front of the fast bowling on the green track of Waka
 chaar test maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 0-2 se pichhadi bhartiya team ko aaf stump se baahar jaati gendon se bachanaa hoga
 Everyone from Michael Clarke to James Pattinson and Peter Siddle to Mike Hussey have repeatedly said that Indian batting can be brought under pressure by throwing a maiden over which gives wickets
 wicketiper broad hadine ne to yahaan tak kah daalaa ki sachin tendulkar balle par gend ke aane kaa intjaar karte hai taaki vah lay hasil kar sake
 If they are bowled outwards, they can be pressurized as seen in the last two Tests
 bharatiyon ko ab aakraamakata dikhaani hogi
 It has also been supported by Mohinder Amarnath, India's best batsman against fast bowling in the last two generations, who is now the national selector
 do test ke baad bharat lautne se pehle amarnath ne kaha tha ki achche tej akraman par bhi dabaav banaaya ja saktaa he lekin iske liye aakraamak hona hoga
 Amarnath played some of the best innings between 1980 and 82 against the fast attack of Pakistan and West Indies
 unhone imran khan, sarfaraj navaj, sikandar bakht, maaikel holding, endi rabarts, mailkam marshall or joel garnor jaise gendbaajon ke khilaaf paanch shatak or saat ardhashatak samet kareeb 1200 ran banaaye the
 His innings of 91 and 80 in the 1982–83 series at the Barbados Test were memorable
 un pariyon main bharat ne 209 or 277 ran banaaye the
 In the second innings, Marshall had a ball on his mouth and started bleeding
 vah sirf taanke lagavane maidan se baahar gaye or lautakar 80 ran banaaye
 The great batsman was struggling to save his career in a 1983 Test in Kanpur when Marshall forced Gavaskar to drop the bat
 gavaskar ne dilli main agle test main apane chir parichit hook shaat lagaaye
 Putting Marshall and Co
 under pressure, he scored 121 runs in just 128 balls
 dilip vengsarakar kaa bhi maananaa he ki tej gendbaajon ke khilaaf aakraamak hona jaruri he
 He scored two consecutive centuries against the West Indies in 1983–84
 sattar ke dashak ke aakhir main vishwa cricket series main greg chapel ne kuch behtareen paariyaan kheli thi
 Chappell had scored 621 runs at an average of 69 in five Super Tests of that unofficial series
 westeindies ke khilaaf unke cat or hook shaat aaj bhi yaad kiye jate hai
 In this series, Australia has added to the problems of Indians by making green pitches
 aaf stump par padati tej gendon ne bharat ke majboot ballebaaji kram kii kalai khol di he
 a young batsman of the team said, 'we thought that the Australians would bowl short of length for which we had prepared
 lekin ve puri langth se gend daal rahe hai or hari bhari pich se unhen swing mil rahi he
 Now we have to play on the front foot, which has increased the problem
 ’ Let us tell you that this discussion on the motion of no confidence will run from 11 am to 6 pm i
e
 seven hours
 bahes kaa jawaab pradhanmantri denge
 During this time there will be no other work in the Lok Sabha

 In the midst of frequent incidents on the india-pakistan border, Sports Minister Vijay Goel has made it clear that India should not play a bilateral series with Pakistan right now
 aaj tak se baat karte hue goyal ne kaha ki jis dhang se donon deshon ke bich maujuuda halaat hai, isaliye cricket nahin hona chahie
 Let us tell you that there is a meeting between BCCI and PCB in Dubai on Monday
 vijay goyal ne kaha ki ham log is par ham log kuch nahin kar sakate hai, par maine bisisiai se kaha he ki hamen dwipaksheeya siries nahin khelni chahie, champions trophy kaa maamla alag he
 Vijay Goel believes that on one hand, Topkistan is spreading cross border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and sending terrorists, how can relations be maintained with Pakistan
 suraksha se samjhauta nahinvijay goyal ne kaha ki khel or raajnneeti ek saath nahin chal sakate, uski ek seemaa hoti he
 When the dispute crosses the border, the two things cannot go together
 agar chota-motaa vivaad ho to chal saktaa he, lekin jab baat desh kii suraksha kii ho to us par samjhauta nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 On Shiv Sena's demand that there should not be any kind of relations with Pakistan, Vijay Goel says that the government has banned many such bilateral games
 champions trophy dwipaksheeya siries nahinvahin rajeev shukla ne is mudde par kaha ki champions trophy kaa muqabla koi dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa nahin he, ye multiple siries he
 This is an ICC tournament, the compulsion of international cricket in which many countries play
 shukla ne kaha ki meri is bare main khel mantri vijay goyal se baat ho chuki he
 Our opinion is theirs
 unhone kaha ki dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa ham nahin khilne ja rahe paak se, is bare main sarkaar jo faisla karegi ham usase poochkar hi aage badhenge
 The talks in Dubai have been just that, because the PCB gave us a legal notice not to play the bilateral series, we will answer it

 bhaajapa kii sambhavit gathambadhan saajhedaar neshnal pipuls party (enpipi) ne 19 siten jeet lee hai
 Voting was held on February 27 in 59 of the state's 60 seats
 meghalaya kii 60 siton vaale vidhansabha chunaav main congress bahumat ke aankade se kuch peeche rah gai he
 It has won 21 seats, while for the majority it should have won 31 seats
 vahiin neshnal pipuls party (enpipi) ko 19 siton par jeet hasil hui he
 The NPP contested the election separately from the BJP, but if it falls behind by a majority, it can tie the BJP out of power
 vaise bhi north east democratic alliance (enidie) main enpipi bijepi kii sahyogi he aurabijepineta bhi usase gathbandhan ko taiyaar dikh rahe hai

 aise main jo bhi pehle nirdaleey yaa chote dalon ko apane kheme main le legaa, vahi meghalaya main sarkaar bana paaegaa
 Let us know that in the 2013 elections, BJP had fielded 13 candidates in this state, but no one could win

 In the last election (2013), the Congress had won the maximum 29 seats, while 13 independents won the election

 Mike says that the story of my forty years of loneliness is like a curved plot of marquees in which the listener gets trapped
 isamen sandigdh qirdaar hai, barbaadiyaan hai, kaamayaabi kii khushi he, lekin mazaaq kahin dur-dur tak nahin he
 Mike is my spouse and a reader and i am an artist
 main kabhi-kabhi apane asambhav jivan ko aise dekhtaa hum jaise main ek atiyathartwaadee, cinemai falkon main faili hui akruti tha
 My name is Balbir Krishna
 main pashchimi uttar pradesh main bagpat jile ke bijrol gaanv main ek jat parivaar main paidaa hua
 i was born at home and in the family i was called as Ballu
 paanch saal baad skool main pehle hi din teacher ne mere naam kaa mazaaq udaate hue use na chalane laayak bataaya, or kaha ki aaj se meraa naam balbir hoga
 In that way the name was recorded forever on the attendance register and on the pages of the rest of my life
 meri kahani main anginat chotein or aise sakht byore hai jinhen maine aaj tak sirf mike ke saath hi baanta he
 The longing, hunger and hope seen in this story cannot be ignored
 main har vakt jeena chahta tha
 Even at the time when i tried to kill myself and at the age of 22, i lay down on the railway tracks and lost my legs
 shaayad main apane puure sharir ke saath ji na paaya hota, lekin aaj main apane durust dimag ke saath jinda hum
 i am able to feel happy and know how to love
 mike kisi bhi tarah ke achche yaa bure bhagya main bharosa nahin karte, par kehete hai ki yadi unhen chamatkaar main yakeen karnaa hi hota, to vah meri jindagi jaisaa hi hota
 i had a very good childhood as a Ballu
 main pitaaji or bobbo (maa) ke saath kheton par jaataa, paali hui bhens kii dekhbhaal karata, or doston ke saath nahar main tairta
 People of familiarity would slap me on the head and bite my hip
 main sundar tha, lekin kuch myanon main baaki ladakon se alag tha
 Bala was my elder sister for a year
 mere paidaa hone ke thik baad vah hamaare naanaa-nani ke paas rahane ke liye bobbo ke gaanv bhej di gai, kyonki unhen ghar par ek bachche kii zarurat thi
 Me and Bobbo used to go there for three months in a year
 meraa apni bahan se bahut lagaav tha
 Those were good moments
 ve bhulaae nahin bhoolatey
 i knew this from childhood, i was separated from other boys and others understood it
 jald hi meraa azaad bachapan khatm ho gaya
 School started
 wo ghar se bahut dur nahin tha
 i used to eat food from home in the afternoon and return to school
 mere pitaaji or bobbo hameshaa kheton main kaam par hote or wo mere liye ek teble par khaanaa lagaakar chhod jate
 One day at the age of nine, i found a neighbor in an empty house
 usne meraa rape kiya
 i arrived late in school with bloodshed and limp
 mere adhyaaapak ko halaat kaa turant andaja ho gaya
 He cheated me in front of other children with a smoke and a full heart
 bachche yah tamaasha dekhakar hansane lage
 He called me 'ganduva', a name which later became associated with Balbir
 is naam ke saath jindagi badal gai
 In the ninth year of age, the small charming world of the village was lost somewhere and the rest of my childhood was handed over to hell
 us padosi ne mujhe jaan se maarane or mere pitaaji ko bure kaam ke bare main bataa dene kii dhamkee di
 When he realized that he was safe from this threat, then i became a small victim of his dirty secret and his easy companions
 main is-us ke haath khelaa jane laga: duusare log or mere skool ke senior ladke yaa bal-bacchon vaale shaadishuda purush
 All
 bahut-se aaj bhi gaanv main rahete hai
 The terror of my public humiliation and threats of reproach guaranteed my silence
 meri kishor umr ke madhya se hi rape meri jindagi main roj kaa vakya ho gaya tha
 My body, which has been scratched for years, still has marks on those wounds
 main apni taangon ke bich ghusaae gaye chithde ko badi tarkeeb se chhupaata or phenkata tha, par pitaaji ko aakhir kaise iskaa kabhi pataa na chal paaya?main unase nafrat karata tha
 They were unsuccessful in protecting me and could never give me such an atmosphere of security that i would be able to take comfort in their arms
 'kyon?' yah main unke marane se pehle puch nahin paaya, lekin jaise hi maine kishor umr main pravesh kiya to unke jite ji roj unase meri ladaai hoti
 He used to beat Bobbo everyday for money and other things
 is baat par unamem or mujhamen yuddh hota, par unhen apni zyaadati kabhi samaj nahin ai
 Children like me find ways to grapple through an internal source that is still escaping
 main apni zamin se lagi nahar ke kinare baitha rahata
 The canal flowed from west to east, touching the horizon, and sunrise and sunset views were visible in its waters
 prakruti ne mujhe sansar ke logon, mere dushmano kii andhergardi main raahat di
 If someone was around, i would move away
 mere kaan dusron se meraa mazaaq sunne ke aadi ho gaye the
 In such a situation, nature supported me
 haalanki yah sachhee or bharosemand thi, par usne mujhe logon se koi hifaazat nahin di
 i had to go back home to eat and drink
 yaheen se meri aadaten bigadgaye lageen
 Bunking from school, smoking cigarettes, stealing, clashing with punches, committing burglaries in the homes of others, and looting people a little away from the village
 main us raah par tha ki main kisi ko maar duun yaa koi mujhe maar de
 One day i had a bad fight with Dad
 nateeja: 16 saal kii umr main main gaanv kii hinsa se bhaag niklaa or dilli kii chautarafa hinsa main ja pahunchaa
 What i found in Delhi, is that people here are even more ruthless
 agar gaanv kii nirdayata mere liye yuddh sareekhee kathor thi, to shahar ke liye main avishwasaneey taur par maasoom tha
 On my very first night at Old Delhi station, a few hundred rupees were stolen from my clothes and father's money
 footpath par do din or do raat bhookha rahane ke baad main behad bure haal main pahunch gaya or bheekh maangane laga
 i sat in the line of temples with the most humbled people of India to eat
 phir kuch din or guzare or mujhe safai karne, bartan dhone or un siginal dukandaaron, jinamein se har koi duusare se zyaada chaalu or do numberi tha, ke rosemara ke kaamon sahit chote-mote kaam milane lage
 i sold coconut, popcorn, and a variety of junk food in the windows of cars at the intersections
 main yonkarmiyon ke ek group main ja padaa
 They decorated me like a girl and leaped my face
 mujhe apana sharir bechnaa padaa
 i started working as a helper in long distance trucks
 main bihar or assam tak gaya
 But not once did i get out of Delhi that the rape started again
 ek bahut hi buree raat ek unmatta or nikrusht trek vaale ne mujhase rape karnaa shuru kar diya
 i realized that to save my own life he would have to be killed
 hamaari khatarnaak ladaai main mere haathon jindagi ganvaane se vah kuch inch bhar hi dur rah gaya tha
 i left him and came back to Delhi somehow broken in heartbreak
 sanyog se bhagya ne kuch achche din dikhaae
 It was a rare occasion that i got a job as a servant in a well-to-do family in Jind district of Haryana
 yahaan maine jivan main pehali baar apane bikhare vajood ke tukdon ko jodpha shuru kiya
 There were many books in my house, which were within my reach
 mujhe vahaan munshi premchand or anya mahaan bhartiya lekhakon kii kahaniyaan or upanyaas mili, jinhone shoshit logon ke sangharsh ke bare main likhaa tha
 i found myself everywhere in those books, and they sowed the seeds of consciousness in me
 agar mujhe gaanv ek tut chuke noujvaan kii tarah ladkadaate hue hi waapas janaa hota jise har koi thokar maarane ko khadaa he, or vahiin se shuru karnaa hota jahaan se main chhodkar gaya tha, to main kabhi waapas na gaya hota
 Instead, about a year and a half after i left the village, i re-entered the remote missing world, full of audacity, angrily, and fighting to claim my own, that is, my life
 mere puraane aattaayi mujhe dekhakar khush ho gaye, par maine sheeghra hi unhen samajha diya ki main ab pehle kii tarah kamazor nahin, or agar unhone chune kii koshish kii to main unke aparaadh kaa khulaasa kar duungaa
 Some of them still tried relentlessly but i did not let them succeed
 mujhe pataa chalaa ki bobbo meri gairmaujuudagi main bina dhaage kaa ek charkha kaatte hue jaagti rahati thi
 When i returned, Dad did not say anything, but cried in private
 mujhe waapas paakar mere saare parivaar vaale khush the
 i went back to school and spent my teenage years protesting father's orders
 chitrakala main meri ruchi tabhi shuru ho gai thi jab ek nanhe bachche ke taur par maine pencil ko thaamna siikhaa tha
 But in my village, girls used to make drawings and sketches, not boys
 ladke to sirf police yaa fouj kii naukari karte the
 Children used to laugh at me for being the only boy in drawing class in high school
 par maine aisi chizon ko nazarandaaz karnaa sikh liya tha
 Despite the constant opposition from the family, i joined the College of Barout for a BA
 gaanv kii lokkala or devi durga kii murti (sanjhi) ne kalakaar banane main meri madad kii
 i learned to make terracotta pots from the potter father of a friend of mine
 apni padhai ke dauraan maine ajanta ke gupha chitron par aadhaarit nagn akritiyon kii ek shrunkhlaa banaai, jinhen maine college kii kitabon main dekha tha
 One day some village elders were at home
 unhone mere ye chitra dekhe
 After that his behavior changed from me
 unhone bolaa ki main ganda kaam kar rahaa hum
 No one in the village knew anything about Ajanta and it was useless to tell anything about it
 yahi vah samay tha jab meri sexual shinaakht ubhar rahi thi, or main swaabhaavik rup se jaanata tha ki mujhe ise gupt rakhana he
 i was scared
 maine kuch drings nasht kar deen or baaki ko chupa diya
 Since then, i have had a long struggle with myself and with society to create nude figures in my paintings, which continues to this day
 maine agra jaakar chitrakala main eme kii padhai jari rakhi
 i had a relationship with another boy there
 main pyaar main pad gaya
 He said that he also loves me, but it was not so
 vah mere saath khel kar rahaa tha
 One day he told me that he had a girlfriend, and that i should make one too
 main buree tarah aahat hua
 But i wanted to keep her close to me, so i tried to love a girl i like
 lekin mujhe bahut jald pataa chal gaya ki main dusron kii tarah nahin ho saktaa
 It was not possible for me
 vah ladki mujhe chooti, chuumati lekin mere bheetar koi halchal hi na hoti
 As we walked along the road, she would talk to me, but my attention got entangled in the beautiful boys passing by instead of her
 maine jaise-taise do maheene tak is tarah kii koshish jari rakhi lekin main puri tarah naakaam rahaa
 i felt that i was constantly cheating on him
 meraa jaise sir fatne laga
 It became difficult for me to withstand so much repetition
 ek din raat main apana yah sara dard or sari duvidha, hostel main hi rah rahe rajasthan ke ek dost ke saamne bayaan kar di
 i cried bitterly
 usase baat karke halkaa hone ke baad main apane kamare main jaakar so gaya
 After getting up in the morning, when i came out of the hostel for tea and breakfast and other things, i found that everyone is laughing and making fun of me
 rajasthan ke us dost ne mere samalangik hone kii baat raturaat puure hostel main pahunchaa di thi
 The act of betraying my lover and then loving a girl broke me from within
 is apmaan or uphaas ke baad main bheetar se jaise khatm ho chukaa tha
 My mood had become such that when i cannot fit in the society, then what is the meaning of living now? At the age of 22, i won many battles, but none of them mattered because the last battle was lost
 mujhe kuch bhi nahin sujh rahaa tha
 Used to stop breathing just here
 subah jo kapade maine pahane the, unheen kapadon main mere kadam raja kii mandi stesan kii ore bad chale, jo paas main hi tha
 i wanted to go far away from people
 stesan pahunchakar main patari pakade-pakade dilli kii disha main chal padaa
 Further, before the tomb of Akbar, there is a deserted area
 chalate-chalate mere kaanon main ve shabd bhi bajane lage, jo bachapan main gaanv main log mujhe bolaa karte the: ganduva, bawalaa, lullu, mehla
 Lullu speaks of insects and people here, and Mehla is such people who like to sit among women
 sach yah tha ki mardon kaa lagaataar shikaar banane ke kaaran main ladakiyon yaa mahilaon ke bich baithta tha
 i used to find myself safe there
 mere kadam patariyon par badhate gaye
 i felt that i was the root of all the trouble
 maine tay kar liya ki ab mujhe maranaa he
 i did not know when the train would arrive
 main patariyon par pet ke bal let gaya
 There will be a time between 11 to 12 noon
 10-15 minute baad ekaek mujhe patariyon main ghurghuraahat sunai di
 And then the horn rang
 main buree tarah kaanp gaya
 It would be barely ten seconds, when i felt that no, i did not want to die and i felt the hunger to stay alive with determination
 mujhe nahin pataa ki jo aghat maine anubhav kiya, wo spashtataa kaa ek kshan tha yaa ki yah khud train hi thi
 But in that moment of trauma, i understood that being alive is everything
 mujhe yaad he, un ain kshanon main maine panje se khud ko patari se dur dhakelne kii koshish kii
 Wanted to get up but ran late
 main khud ko bachaa paata, usase pehle hi train mere pairon ke upar se guzarati chali gai
 And i remained unclaimed there with my severed legs
 dard ke un bhayankar kshanon main jinda rahane kii chahat mere rome-rome main samaa gai
 i just knew that i had to keep myself alive somehow
 main patariyon se neeche pathar kii tarah ludhaka or phir ghistate hue kohni ke sahare trek se dur chalane laga
 It was the 14th of September in the rainy season
 dopaher main dhoop khaasi tej thi
 My throat was dry
 raste main ek gadde main bhare pani par kaai-si jami thi
 Going to shore, with both hands resting under water, i started drinking dirty, hot water
 yah garam pani amrit kii tarah laga
 i kept walking while sobbing and moaning with leaking legs
 aasapaas koi na tha, jo meri karaah sun saktaa
 After walking for one to two hours, i saw some children grazing cow-buffalo
 main dhire-dhire paas pahunchaa or apni puri takat lagaakar madad ke liye chillaaya
 But instead of approaching them, the children ran away from fear
 yahi vah vakt tha, jab mujhe laga ki ab sab kuch khatm ho gaya he
 After seeing the sun on my head once, i have now left myself in despair
 behosh main ab bhi nahin hua tha
 After a while there were some sounds in my ears
 maine ankhen kholkar dekha to ve bachche devdoot banakar apni maanon ke saath vahaan aa pahunche the
 After this, as humanity came into its most beautiful form
 kisi tarah unhone bhagkar trephic police ko bulaayaa, jinhone mujhe apni jeep se agra ke es
 N
 medical college pahunchaaya
 After this, a whole army of doctors and college teachers and students started saving me
 der raat mere parivaar ke log bhi gaanv se aspataal pahunch gaye
 When i regained consciousness, the biggest feeling was that i am alive and still 'gay'
 yah ek aisa atal satya tha jisko maut bhi katl nahin kar pai
 i felt that there is nothing greater than being alive
 mike punarjanm main vishwaas nahin karte, lekin wo kehete hai ki agar koi dobaaraa paidaa hua he to yah 1996 main main tha
 i have said this many times before that i had lost my legs that day, but had lost my life
 main accident ke baad jinda bachuungaa, iskaa koi anumaan or koi chikitsakeey ummid to yakeenan nahin thi
 i spent three months in the hospital between life and death
 jab meraa haemoglobin anaesthesia dene ke liye nunatam str par pahunch gaya to meri kai surjariyon main se pehali shuru hui, or ghutanon par ang viched ke parinaam tak pahunchi
 For the next several years, i spent the bunk of the house under the care of Bobo and younger brother, Arun, 13 years old
 meraa puraa parivaar mere accident ke baad puri tarah se jaise tabah ho gaya
 They all endured one moment of my grief
 pitaaji mahaj ek adana kisaan the
 All his savings were spent in my treatment
 or upar se karj lenaa padaa
 My family did everything to save me
 mere rishtedaaron ne bhi hamaari madad kii
 Fortunately in Agra, the disclosure of my homosexuality did not reach my village with me
 maine kisi ko nahin bataaya ki maine khudakushi kii koshish kii thi
 i just let the accident remain an accident and did not discuss much that i was gay
 maine apni eme kii padhai college kii ek sahruday professor chitralekha singh or college ke hi do doston, swatantra bala or jagmohan ravat, kii madad se bistar par hi pade-pade pun: shuru kii
 They sent me books and exempted them from class attendance
 jab main uthne ke kaabil hua to professor ne ek charity ko dhundha jisane mujhe haath vaali ek tricycle daan main di, jise maine teen saal tak istemaal kiya
 i had to study, i needed money for this
 pitaaji kaa swasthya thik nahin tha or kamai karne ke lihaaj se chote bhai kii umr abhi kaaphi kam thi
 We were very sick
 san 1997 main maine apane gaanv ke ek public skool main chote bacchon ko padhaanaa shuru kiya
 The founder of the school called me to teach
 hamane chalis vidhyaarthiyon ko aapas main baant liya
 i started earning Rs 700 a month, but it depended on whether the families of the children paid the fees or not
 1999 main ek or traasadee hamaare jarjar parivaar par tuuti
 My sister was killed in a terrible accident, leaving two children behind
 har cheez jaise puri tarah syah thi
 i was completely empty and alone within myself
 meraa dil athaah vednaa se bharaa tha
 There was no one around me to share it with, but i knew that i had my art
 main chitra bananaa chahta tha, par mere paas rang, brush or canvas kharidne ke paise nahin the
 One day i started to do some engraving on paper with cheap hair point pens at home
 or bahut jald mujhe pataa chalaa ki sasta bal pen mere liye ek jaadui tohfa he
 i would teach during the day and at night, all night, i would draw
 har koi jaanata he ki meri kala ne meraa jivan bachaaya
 i used to do drawing since childhood, but in bed i learned by myself how to do drawing? To paint as well
 kala kii jo bhi kitaab or catalog mere haath lage, maine unki cheerfaad or vishleshan kiya
 Then they discovered their own themes and characters and devised their own methods
 meraa jivan chunki angadh-anirmit tha, isliye chitrakala ke mere sabhi nae kaam bhi vaise hi the
 In my early post-accident work, i depicted grieving children and suffering human beings because i was the only child in the procession
 maine apni tuuti-phooti javaani ji, lekin bagaiyr apane sampurna sharir ke
 And of course the fragmentation that one sees in most of my work is the reason
 baavjood iske ki meraa kaam alag-alag charnon main dikhataa he
 There are sources of unity within it that add to it, because primarily it is autobiographical
 san 2000 main mujhe kritrim jaipur foot lagaae gaye
 They were heavy and fat but they were the form of God for me
 maine unke saath rahanaa sikh liya, or unhone mere liye har cheez ko badal diya
 i wore them for fifteen years
 isi saal maine net-ujisi kii pariksha paas kii or elahabaad main lekturer ke pad ke liye intervyuu diya
 In the panel, Dr

 i took some of my drawings made with cheap ball pens, which he asked me to show
 mujhe naukari nahin mili lekin ve mere kaam se prabhavit hue or mujhase meraa kalakaar kaa 'rigeume' maanga
 He was surprised that i did not have that, and that i never thought of exhibiting my paintings
 unhone meraa sampark dow
 Sabita Nag who was the chairperson of the painting department of a college in Meerut, 60 km from my village
 dow
 Sabita Nag appeared like a mother to me
 uske baad mere liye sab kuch badal gaya
 He got photographs of my work, got them framed, helped me to apply for group exhibitions at state academies and got my first drawings sold
 meri chitrakrutiyaan rajya or rashtriya str kii kai pradarshaniyon main chaynit, pradarshit or puraskrit honi shuru huin
 In 2003, i quit my public school job and started painting full time
 meri kala mere jivan main paisa or shoharat laai
 In 2004, a Mumbai based corporate house searched me with the help of Sabita Nag
 unhone meraa banaaya sara kaam bahut kam daamon main kharid liya, lekin vah thodaa paisa hamaare liye bahut badi madad tha
 That money solved many of our problems
 hamane jeena shuru kiya
 We started feeling happy
 us paise ne mujhe hamaare parivaar ko bachaane main madad kii
 i arranged for better treatment for my father and good education for my brother and a government job
 2004 se 2008 tak maine company ko kareeb 135 drings or paintings bechin
 In 2008 i decided not to sell any more paintings
 main hameshaa jaanata tha ki main kisi ladki se shaadi or dhokhaa nahin kar saktaa, isliye maine vivaah se inkaar kar diya
 My brother got married and took care of our family
 san 2008 main main gaanv se dilli chalaa gaya, apane chitrakaar banane ke sapane ko saakaar karne ke liye
 i held my first solo exhibition in 2010 and it went very well
 maine apana kaam khub bechaa
 After some success, i decided that i should work as a government teacher
 or phir main gaanv laut gaya
 i did my second solo exhibition 'out Hair and Now' at the Lalit Kala Akademi in Delhi in late 2011
 yah mere kalakaar ke or mere khud ke saamne aane kii kahani thi
 i publicly accepted the fact that i am gay
 yah ek jaadui ehsaas tha ki main ab ek out and proud ge hum
 The paintings in the exhibition included men who were naked, side-by-side, completely sexual, but emotionally attached
 maine apane vishyon ko saikadon choti-choti youniktaa se bharpoor chhaviyon par paint kiya jinhen maine internet se sankalit kiya or canvas par print kiya tha
 This series was thus important to me for several reasons
 chitrakruti ke bheetar main dekh rahaa hum un landscapon ko jahaan mere vishay basate hai
 i know, they are annoying
 ve mere kchwaabon, du:swapnon, smritiyon, sankalpanaaon or aatank kii drushtiyaan hai
 i know that a very large area falls into it, but it is the same and the same physical, mental and emotional world in which i live
 us siries ko paint karnaa or baahar laana behad jaruri tha
 On the second day of the exhibition i fully understood how dangerous such a show was
 mujhe anjaan phone kol aane lage jinamein mujhapar bhartiya samskruti ko mitti main milaane kaa aarope lagaaya gaya, pradarshnee ko band karne kii chetavanee or jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di gai
 My posters in the city were torn down or blackened
 main ashakt tha
 On the last day of the exhibition, during the filming of people visiting the gallery, an entrapped masked attacked me
 usne ek painting nasht kar di or mujhe farsh par giraakar laaten maarin
 i could neither help myself nor run away due to my physical helplessness
 iske tatkaal baad mere parivaar ne mujhapar dabaav banaaya ki bachi hui pradarshnee ko cancil karke main ghar waapas laut aauun
 When i was between the hospital and the police station, a friend started covering it for me
 tabhi kai kalakaar kaaryakarta, jinamein ram rahamaan, johny emel or sunil gupta shaamil the, mujhase ise jari rakhane kaa aagrah karne ke liye gailaree main jamaa hue or mujhe hifaazat or dosti kii peshkash kii
 He gave this news to the media, which took up this story and reported it as an extreme act and attack on freedom of expression
 prachaar se hui kirakiri ke kaaran police ko report darj kerani padi, jaisaa karne se shuru main unhone yah kahkar manaa kar diya tha ki is puri musiibat kaa mulgim main khud hi hum or mere saath jo hua vah sahi hua
 The news of an attack on a crippled gay artist was published in media around the world
 iske baad meri yah pradarshnee triveni kala sangam main phir se lagaai gai
 LGBT community of Delhi collectively attended its opening
 yah pehali baar tha ki main apane samudaay ke logon se mila jo ge ke rup main pahachaane jaakar garvit the
 This was a new Ilham for me
 main abhi bhi gaanv kaa ek jat tha
 i had no idea of the gay rights landscape of cities
 meri jaagrukta teji se badi or usne meri pahchaan or mujhe kaise jeena he, kii meri avadharana ko badal diya
 It was during this exhibition that i met Mayna Mukherjee, director of the Engendered Gallery, with whom i became a precious relationship
 unhone mere chitron kii bahut sari pradarshaniyaan bharat bhar main kin
 After this, i started living with my partner Krishna's way of living
 san 2012 main, rishte kii shuruyaat ke 13 saal baad, ham alag ho gaye
 i was not afraid of anything
 maine khud ko dhundh liya tha
 i understood who i am
 maine aazaadee paa lee thi
 Over the years, i have been so clear about my sexuality, my youth, my accident, my art, my marriage to Mike, that this clarity of 'who am I', 'what am i Have to do 'and everything i want to do or do, has a mantra
 main balbir hum, chalis saal kii tabaahi or baad kaa ullas liye, baahar kadam rakh rahaa hum, yatra kar rahaa hum, abhi bhi baahar duniya main nikal rahaa hum, or jivan kii laalasaa rakhe hum
 In 2012 i met Mike
 ve pragati maidan main mere sho main aae the
 We fell in love with each other
 main hameshaa kisi ke saath ek parivaar kii tarah rahanaa chahta tha
 i always wanted to love a man
 maine krishna ke saath 13 saal koshish kii lekin vah kaamyaab na hui
 Michael gave me this wedding opportunity, but it was not easy
 bharat main samalangik sambandh ek aparaadh he or ge marij kanuunan nahin kii ja sakati
 We have Section 377 which does not allow homosexuals to love
 april 2013 main mike ne mujhe shaadi ke liye propose kiya or maine manjuur kar liya
 It was the happiest moment in my life
 hamane dilli main ek saadhaaran samaaroh main sagaai kii
 The news of our engagement reached my village and everything was separated from me
 bobbo or bhai ne mujhase saare sambandh tod liye
 The madness fell behind
 meri naukari chhot gai
 My life was in danger there
 mere ek dost ne mujhe saavdhaan kiya ki gaanv ke log mere khilaaf ho gaye hai
 i missed my village, my birthplace too
 tab se ab tak main apane gaanv nahin gaya hum
 i moved to Delhi with Mike and hid myself indoors for several months
 teen saal tak main bobbo or parivaar ke kisi anya sadsy ko nahin dekh paaya
 i still do not understand that some people like us have to lose everything, so that they chose someone for love? In the last months of 2013, i was invited to the exhibition in a gallery located in a five star hotel in Hyderabad
 Invited for ek bhavy or safal udghaatan ke agle roj meraa sho moral police, saamaajik dabaavon or 'kaaphi jane-maane, prabhaavshaalee' logon kii phone colls ke kaaran band kar diya gaya
 What is happening in our India? We know that there are narrow groups, organizations, religious and political parties here
 ve bharat ke saanskrithik paridrishy main hajaaron saal se bhi zyaada puraani yonik kalatmak abhivyakti kii maujuudagi ko nakaarte hai
 Such expressions and conduct are considered derogatory to 'traditional' Indian cultural and religious values
 hamaare swayambhu sensorkarta kai baar hinsa kii dhamkee ke taur par dandagna ghoshit karte hai
 They often try to successfully create pressure to stop artistic expressions
 maine 2014 main neuyork main mike se shaadi kar lee
 After this, Mike decided to quit his job in India
 is vajah se hamane america chale jane kaa faisla kiya
 In 2016, we moved to the US completely
 bharat chhodie ke pehle meraa puraa parivaar—bobbo, bhai, bhattije, do bhaanje dilli main mujhase milane aae
 And this was the time when i realized that love is everything
 yahaan america main neuyork ke paas hamane sapanom kaa ghar kharida or vahiin par ek art studio banaaya
 i paint all day
 bharat or america main apane kaam kii pradarshaniyaan bhi laga rahaa hum
 i am happy with Mike
 apni jindagi ke in sab dardanaak padaavon se guzarakar aane ke baad bhi mujhe lagata he ki main bahut khushnaseeb hum
 The future with Mike looks hopeless and golden
 isse acha ehsaas kuch bhi nahin he ki aaj mere do ghar hai
 An India where i was born and where i got everything from and an America where i am living today
 ummid he ki bhavishya main ham dilli main bhi apana ek chota-sa ghar banaaenge or kanoonee taur par shaadishuda parivaar kii tarah vahaan bhi rah sakenge

 Along with this, Sri Lankan batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene will also have to leave cricket for the loss

 Sangakkara, the only batsman to score four consecutive centuries in odis, scored the highest 45 runs for Sri Lanka
 sangakaara test cricket khelte rahenge, jabaki test ko pehle hi alavida kah chuke jayavardhane sirf chaar ran bana sake
 Earlier, Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews won the toss today and decided to bat, which proved to be wrong
 chaar ran ke score par uske do ballebaaj pavilion laut chuke the
 Sangakkara scored the highest 45 runs, but for this he faced 96 balls and hit only three fours
 unhone lahiru tirimanne (41) ke saath tisare wicket ke liye 65 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 No Sri Lankan batsman could survive on the SCG pitch

 He first dismissed Matthews in the 33rd over and then sent Kulasekara and Kushal to the pavilion in the 35th over
 vishwa cap main hetric banane vaale vah nauven gendbaaj ho gaye
 He is the first spinner to do this feat after Pakistan's Sakleen Mushtaq (1999)

 Sangakkara returned from deep bowler Morne Morkel's catch to deep thirdman before halting the game due to rain

 We did not know Ilavarasan, who lives in Naikenkottai in Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu
 phir ham main se bahuton kii tarah usne dil diya or vah mashhoor ho gaya
 Or that some people became infamous

 Caste, we cannot escape this one word

 But we think or tell that after 65 years of independence, caste has collapsed
 i ilavarsan ek dalit tha
 His body was found on the railway line of Dharmapuri last Wednesday
 khabar ko rashtriya str par pahunchane main thodaa samay lag gaya
 Earlier, his wife Divya had said on Tuesday that she would never go back to her husband and stay with the mother
 19 saal ke ilavarsan ko divya se pyaar ho gaya tha
 22-year-old Divya came from Vanniyar (OBC) category
 14 oktober 2012 ko donon ne shaadi kii thi
 Religion does not understand love
 khaas taur se antarjaateey shaadiyon ke sambandh main
 Splashes of devastation reached Divya's family as well
 donon kii shaadi ke baad uske pita ne khudakushi kar lee
 Around 300 huts of Dalits were burnt across the district

 Police kept on saying that Ilavarasan committed suicide, but his family suspects something else
 uske mata-pita bataate hai ki unke bete ko apni ruthi hui patni ke laut aane kii puri ummid thi
 He had also withdrawn money from his father's ATM card to go out of work
 police kaa kahana he ki usne shav se divya kii tasviren or use 2011 main bheje gaye teen khat baraamad kiye hai
 Police are stationed across the district, but fierce fire is on both sides of the division

 haryana main teen saal se congress kaa koi sthaayee pradesh adhyaksh nahin tha
 When party president Phoolchand Mullana resigned, no one said anything about his approval or rejection of his resignation in the old style of the party
 mulaanaa ne vyaavhaarik taur par koi adhikaar na hote hue bhi jab kaam jari rakhaa to haryana ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda ne sochaa ki chunavi sho kaa sanchaalan vahiin karenge
 But suddenly in February, Ashok Tanwar of Rahul Gandhi's faction was made the party president
 lihaaja chunavi abhiyaan kii bajaae congress kii ladaai hooda banaam tanvar main hi simat gai
 The story of Maharashtra is different from this
 vahaan mana ja rahaa tha ki mukhyamantri prithviraj chavaan kii rajnatik kshamta bahut zyada nahin he
 But in fact, he wanted to emerge as the new Maratha leader
 iskaa saaf matlab tha sharad pavaar pavaar or ensipi kii takat kam karnaa
 So a fight broke out between the coalition partners and the alliance broke
 rahul ne ensipi ke saath bhagidaari aage le jane main dilchaspee nahin dikhaai or maharashtra main halaat bigadgaye die
 Sharad Pawar also parted ways with the Congress to keep the NCP relevant as a small party
 vahiin rahul ke ek anya samarthak mohan prakaash ne maharashtra ke party mahasachiv-prabharee ke taur par dilli se maharashtra kii kaman apane haath main le lee
 The situation was further compounded when Ahmad Patel, Sonia Gandhi's political secretary, came in support of the powerful Ashok Chavan
 donon rajyon main aakraamak campan kii anichhaa ke baavjood rahul or unki team ne in chunaavon kii ranneeti main apni sthiti majboot kar lee or prabhavakaari tathaa ahm faisle kiye
 Those decisions did not yield the expected results
 maharashtra main isane ensipi se jaldi munh mode liya to haryana main tanvar kii khud ko taqatvar banane kii mahatvakanksha dikhi
 Worse, they disbanded local Congress organizations
 yani jila or blokon main party ke sanghathankarta puure campan ke dauraan vyaavhaarik taur par maujuud nahin rahe
 The results reveal this because many of his candidates did not even finish third
 kai myanon main loksabhaa chunaavon kii tarah hi ek baar phir haryana or maharashtra donon jagah rahul padaadhikariyon or kshatrapon ke khilaaf saahas dikhaane main naakaam rahe
 His candidates did not live up to the expectations, which questions the strategy of bringing back the Congress
 party ko sabase adhik nuksaan unke aspasht acshan plan ne pahunchaaya
 Neither he was able to leave Hooda in Haryana nor any alternative plan after the NCP split in Maharashtra
 ab bhi unke samarthakon ne haar nahin maani he
 Tanwar wants generational change in the party
 "there is a need to give more representation and responsibility to new faces in the party
" ’’ vahiin varisht netaa saavdhaanee barat rahe hai
 Party general secretary Digvijay Singh says, "the campaign is fine, but Rahul should be seen among the people
" unhen lagaataar deshbhar ke hisson kaa daura karnaa chahie or yuvaaon se judye ke liye twitor or soshal media ke anya plateform ko jwine karnaa chahie
 "now the return of the Congress depends on how Rahul makes the foundation stronger rather than appointing arbitrators
" janardan dvivedi kehete hai, ‘‘hamen khud se poochna hoga ki hamane kahaan galati kii
 We have to come out of the view that the destiny of the Congress is to rule

 The ministers have been asked to submit the details of the files found in their offices between June 31, 2017, five days after the government assumed office on June 1, 2014

 On 27 May, Aaj Tak waged a campaign against the black marketing of Tatkal tickets of Railways
 jab railway ne karrwai nahin kii to phir ek june ko nae sire se muhim ko aage badhaayaa
 Thousands of people joined the campaign from all over the country and as a result, the Railways also had to wake up from sleep
 ajtak par sting oparation ke jariye dikhaaya gaya tha ki kis tarah bade paimaane par railway tikaton kii dhaandhlee ho rahi he
 It was also shown how common people do not get confirmed tickets in an instant even after standing in queue for hours
 saath hi un dallalon kaa cheharaa bhi dikhaaya gaya jo booking clerk se mileebhagat kar tatkaal seva kaa faaydaa uthaa rahe hai
 Apart from this, the website which Rail has created for reservation, i

 unhone kaha ki vah 1991 se chunaav kshetra main jaakar logon se mil rahi hai
 For a few days, there was speculation that Priyanka would enter active politics, but her message is clear that she has no such intention at the moment
 yah bhi padhein: gauri lankesh kaa vah sampadakeey, jiske baad unhen goli maar di gaitippaniyan This is not good, we should see what we are getting from what we are distributing
 hamane jin sarkaron or netaaon kii karatuuton par pardaa daalana shuru kar diya he apni raajnneetik or vaicharik vafadari ke chalate, yah ham acha nahin kar rahe hai
 They are also not doing well who protest and are supported in the name of support
 ye donon hi isamen baraabar ke kasuurvaar hai
 So take care that this murder does not become the story of another murder and we are planning to meet on another reverence
 kal raat se aisa lag rahaa he ki jaise main jinda laash hum, logon ne mujhe goli maar di he or aap log meri laash dhokar chal rahe hai
 So many well-wishers, readers and viewers from across the country have written that you should stop speaking alone, you will do the same for you
 grahamantri or pradhanmantri se likho ki suraksha den
 Hey brother, when the spoons were not able to provide protection, only Dochar has got SPG protection then from where will he give us
 or kitne patrkaar espiji lekar chalane vaale hai
 This has created a political atmosphere
 bhale hi aap usamen sidhe shaamil nahin hai
 But the atmosphere that supports you is the creation of the same atmosphere which is laughing at the murder of Gauri Lankesh
 ye sharmnaak he, ye hindutv kaa koun sa cheharaa he ki koi mar jayega or ham vahaan jaakar hansenge or kahenge ki kutiya he
 This is the same society that did not speak in favor of two women fighting against Ram Rahim
 aap kisi mahila ayog ke adhyaksh kaa naam jaanate hai jinhone un do mahilaon kaa paksh liya ho? kisi mantri, santri, mahasachiv yaa adhyaksh kaa naam jaanate hai jinhone un do mahilaon ke bare koi twit kiya ho
 Due to the fight of those women, the empire of such a big Baba has collapsed
 lekin hamaara samaaj or jo jimmedaar log hai ve sirf slogan main 'beti bachaao, beti padhaao' maanate hai
 There is also the question that a woman journalist has been murdered, some women in the country hardly reach the level where they show mirror to the society and government with their sharpness
 gauri kii hatya ek pratibha kaa nuksaan to he hi
 Someone reaches there after a long battle and impresses the society with his talk, raises the matter, at that point someone's life is over, this is not a good thing
 meri yahi ladaai he ki is ladaai ko kisi anjaam tak le jaaie
 Please, pray to the Prime Minister not to follow such people
 koi nahin miltaa unhen hindustan main to mujhe follow kar len, main unhen aashwaasan detaa hum ki bahut aadar se aalochana karuunga
 They will never feel that i have insulted them
 bahut acchhee kavitaayen sunaauungaa, hindu dharm ke bahut saare shloke sunaauungaa
 They will not feel that they are in a country where no one appreciates them
 main unhen puraa-puraa sammaan duungaa
 But before giving any slogan about girls and women, he will answer from where did youngsters like Dadhich come from his company
 or jab ve aate hai 17 sau ke club main to ve ye bataaen or us ladke se puuchhen ki tumne meri maryaada kaa khyaal kyon nahin rakhaa
 And when those boys cannot take care of the dignity of the Prime Minister, then an army of madmen and madmen is ready
 ye fouj aapako akele main bhi gher kar maaregi or jahaan aap hazaar kii sankhya main hai wo vahaan bhi aapako gher kar maaregi
 The question is not only to protect oneself, but also for the rest of the public, who is fighting every day to get answers to his principles in this prime time, his question should be questioned
 roj tivi par sarkaar kii taraf se jo gunde baithte hai jo kaala kot lagaakar baithte hai vah ek dizin he
 Believe it or not, do not look, but after ten years you will see that the fake questions are extracted and the fake issues are discussed day after day to crush the problems of the public
 is tarah lagaataar logon kii aakankshaon kii hatya ho rahi he, unako daraaya ja rahaa he, ek bhay kaa maahaul taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he

 bahut se shahari logon ke liye gaanv ek biimaar baccha he, jise yojanaon ke sarkari aspataalon main jane kab se thik kiya ja rahaa he
 For many people, the village is a place of nostalgia, where everything is as it was when they left
 jisaki hawa kahin se nahin aati balki vahiin paidaa hoti he or khap jaati he
 The ghee never spoils and the vegetable grows without chemicals
 dilli se chalane vaali yojanaayen naam to pradhanmantri kaa dhoti hai, magar gaanv ke pradhan ke ghar pahunchate hi apana bojha utaar detii hai
 Delhi dreams for every village and every village is the way to Delhi
 jab tak koi yojana gaanv pahunchati he, gaanv vaala dilli mumbai kii rail pakad letaa he
 Amidst all these disappointments, the Prime Minister announced the Adarsh gram Yojana from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15 August, which was launched on 11 October, the birth anniversary of JP
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki har saansad ko 2019 tak teen adarsh gaanv banane honge
 The first village should be built by 2016 and 5 more villages by 2019
 is hisaab se das saal ke bheetar 6433 gaanv adarsh ho jaaenge
 There are more than six lakh villages in India
 yani das saal main ek pratishat ke aas paas hi gaanv adarsh ban paaege
 The prime minister's aim is that the rest of the villages will learn from them
 isse pehle ki baaki gaanv sikhte khabar aane lagi ki kisi netaa ne apni jati kii bahulata vaale gaanv kaa chayan kiya he to kisi ne us gaanv kaa chayan kiya, jisamen ek bhi musalmaan nahin he
 Going against the ideals of the constitution, news of the ideal of discrimination started coming
 baaki gaanv ye sab na hi seekhen to acha rahegaa, kyonki adarsh gaanv kaa ek likhit uddeshy yah bhi he ki vahaan saamaajik samarasata or nyaay sunishchit karnaa he
 For the first time, such a category was created for the selection of a scheme that the village should not belong to the in-laws and the maiden
 varna in gaanvon ke mulaayam singh yadav ke saifai jaise ativiksit hone kaa khatra ho saktaa he
 So the condition of Adarsh gram Yojana is simple, mps can choose any Gram Panchayat except their own and their spouse's village
 3000−5000 kii jansankhya honi chahie gaanv kii
 There should be 1000–3000 for hilly areas
 aisa criteria banaaya gaya ki jaiprakash narayan kaa gaanv sitab diyaara hi baahar ho gaya
 The village, whose birth anniversary was planned, could not be chosen as an ideal village because of its population
 adarsh gram yojana ke launch ke samay pradhanmantri kaa diya bhaashan or chalis pannon kii ek guideline pustika www
 saanjhi
 gov
 exists on
 isamen jo kaarysoochee he, usamen 80 se bhi zyada prakaar ke kaam hai
 There is so much work that the MP will not even get time to drink tea in another village
 shaadi or shraadh main bulaave ko kaise manaa karenge ye vahi jane
 i have selected a few from the guidelines according to me
 adarsh gram yojana ke tahat gaanv ke vikaas ko chaar bhaagon main baanta gaya he
 Personal, human, economic and social
 vaiyaktik vikaas ke tahat saaf safai kii aadat kaa vikaas kiya jayega
 There will be daily exercises
 rose nahaane or daant saaf karne kii sikh di jaaegi
 Everyone will get basic health services in the interest of human development, the sex ratio will be balanced
 skool smart ho jaaenge or kam se kam dasvin paas shikshit honge hi
 Under the social development, a rural song will have to be made, which will create a sense of pride among the people on the occasion of Village Day, and proactive measures will be taken for inclusion of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the villages
 aarthik vikaas ke tahat mitti health card, beej bank kii sthapana, gobar bank, maveshi hostal banegaa
 Seeing the Hindi of the guideline, it was felt that the ideal government Hindi scheme should be launched first
 adarsh gram main niyamit gram sabha to hogi hi mahila sabha or bal sabha bhi hogi
 According to the guidelines, Adarsh gram aims to promote transparency, accountability and honesty in public life and generate a sense of confidence
 eemaandaaree ko badhaava dene vaali is yojana ko raajnneetik dalon main bhi lagu kiya janaa chahie
 Our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra has gathered information that Adarsh gram should have been selected for MP Adarsh gram Yojana between 11 October and 11 November, but 206 mps of both the Houses have not yet identified Adarsh gram
 pradhanmantri ne is yojana ke launch ke samay kaha tha ki ham chaahate hai ki yojana gaanvon main banakar dilli aae
 But when you read the guidelines, Delhi has left little scope for villages in it
 to saansadon ne kaam karne ke dar se sawaal uthaaen hai yaa vaaki unke sawaal vaazib hai ki iske liye paisa kahaan se aayega
 Where will the doctor come to give first aid? What will be the outline of cattle hostels? guidelins main likhaa he ki centre or rajyon kii anya yojanaon ke sansadhano kaa istemaal karnaa hoga
 To raise money from private companies' social funds
 saansad nidhi ke paise kaa bhi iske liye istemaal ho saktaa he
 Opposition party mps are not satisfied with this
 pehle bhi 2009−10 main pradhanmantri adarsh gram yojana bani thi, jiske tahat un gaanvon kaa chayan hona tha, jisamen pachaas fisadi se zyada dalit aabaadi ho
 In the first phase, it was selected one thousand villages in several states
 vah adarsh bane kii nahin bane mujhe jaankaree nahin he
 It is not known whether that plan has ended
 bollywood abhinetri jaayra wasim ne islam kaa hawala dete hue bollywood ko alavida kah diya
 His career was just five years old
 dharm ke naam par unke is tarah filmon ko chhodane se ek nai bahes ne janm diya he
 Politicians are also constantly commenting on this
 is bich congress netaa abhishek manu singhvi ne bhi ek twit kiya, jisapar bahes ho gai
 He wrote that 'halala justified and acting haram, will the Muslims of India progress like this? But some people have raised questions on social media
 twitor par logon kaa kahana he ki congress ke ek bade netaa kii taraf se is tarah kii tippanee aana shobhaa nahin detaa he
 So at the same time some people called it wrong thinking

 Not only politicians, but many Bollywood celebrities also misunderstood to leave such films in the name of religion
 bollywood abhinetri ravina tandon ne bhi likhaa tha ki filmein chhodana unka nijee faisla he lekin is tarah dharm kaa naam nahin lenaa chahie

 In Bhopal, Shivraj Singh Chauhan has said that 'trinamool Congress's departure from Bengal is certain'
 shivaraj ne aage kaha ki bengal main jo ho rahaa he wo saaf dikhaa rahaa he ki kaise 'bengal main loktantr ko taar-taar kiya ja rahaa he or samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan udayi ja rahi hai'
 Shivraj further intensified the attack on Mamata Banerjee, saying that 'the Chief Minister of Bengal has created an unprecedented constitutional crisis'
 shivaraj ne bataaya ki 'sharada chitfund ghotaale kii jaanch sibiai apni marji se nahi kar rahi he balki mananeey sarvocch nyaayalay ke nirdesh par sharada chitfund ghotaale kii jaanch ho rahi he'
 Shivraj denied the charge of CBI action at the behest of BJP and said that 'this investigation is not a present day investigation but it is before 2014'

 Shivraj asked, 'who is Mamata afraid of getting trapped when there is a CBI investigation? Why is the investigation not being supported? The Mamata government's move is a contempt of the Supreme Court and an attempt to demolish India's central structure '
 'bijepi se ghabaraai mamata'- shivarajashivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha ki 'bengal main bhartiya janata party kii badhati hui lokapriyata se ghabaraakar bijepi ke netaaon kii sabhaayen roki ja rahi hai
 The helicopter is not allowed to land and the workers are being killed '
 shivaraj ne kaha ki 'pashchim bengal main ab tiemasi kaa janaa tay he or mamata banerjee ko ghotaalon main funsane or kis-kis ke naam ujagar honge, iskaa dar he

 kyonki bharat ko ginati ke naam hi france or germany kii sarkaron se mili hai
 Apart from this, the list which Indian officers have, is stolen
 ise bank ke karmchaaree ko ghoose de kar ikattha kiya gaya he
 He has no recognition in the eyes of law
 is list main jo bhi naam hai bank unki tasdik nahin karne ja rahe
 The Income Tax Department is simply taking affidavits from those who deny foreign accounts
 kuch maamalon main bas naam hai unke khate kii raqam nahin
 Due to this theft list, the Income Tax Department cannot do the work of search fines or seizure
 is maamle main mushkil sirf itani hi nahin he
 Due to the agreements with other countries, the income tax department is also tied
 bharat or switzaraland ke bich ke samjhaute main 2011 ke baad ke hi naam ujagar karne par sahmati he, uske pehle ke koi byore nahin
 While sharing the list, France had signed that the Income Tax Department could not give this name to any other department, that is, not even to the Directorate of Enforcement
 isliye iskar vibhaag sirf notice or saman jari kar saktaa he
 According to agreements reached with France, Switzerland and Germany, only the courts can reveal names, not governments
 abhi bharat or bhi videshi khatedaaron ke naam hasil karne kii koshish main he
 In such a situation, breach of any agreement can hurt the whole effort

 Shayani Ekadashi 2019: It is believed that Lord Vishnu goes into sleep for four months on the day of Devshayani Ekadashi (devshayani Ekadashi)
 is puure chaar maheene ke dauraan koi bhi shubh kaam jaise shaadiyaan, namakaran, janeu, grah pravesh or mundan nahin hote
 Lord Vishnu wakes up on the day of Devprabodhini Ekadashi after a gap of four months
 is din ke baad se hindu dharm main mangalik kaaryon kii ek baar phir shuruyaat ho jaati he
 Here you know why Lord Vishnu goes into sleep for four months
 jaaniye devshayni ekadshi kii puja vidhi or vrath kathavaman puraana ke mutabik asuron ke raja bali ne apane bal or parakram se teenon lokon par adhikaar kar liya tha
 Seeing the suzerainty of King Bali, the god Indra panicked and approached Lord Vishnu seeking help
 devataaon kii pukaar sunakar bhagwaan vishnu ne vaaman avatar dhaaran kiya or raja bali se bhiksha maangane pahunch gaye
 Lord Vamana asked for three steps of land from Bali
 pehle or duusare pag main bhagwaan ne dharti or akaash ko naap liya
 Now there was nothing left to keep the third step, then King Bali said to put the third step on his head
 bhagwaan vaapan ne aisa hi kiya
 In this way the worries of the deities came to an end
 vahiin bhagwaan raja bali ke daan-dharm se bahut prasann hue
 When he asked King Bali to ask for a boon, Bali asked him to settle in Hades
 bali kii ichha purti ke liye bhagwaan ko pataal janaa padaa
 After the demise of Lord Vishnu, all the gods and Goddess Lakshmi got worried
 apane pati bhagwaan vishnu ko waapas laane ke liye mata lakshmi garib stri banakar raja bali ke paas pahunchi or unhen apana bhai banaakar raakhi baandh di
 In return, Lord vowed to take Vishnu back from the Hades
 pataal se vidaa lete vakt bhagwaan vishnu ne raja bali ko vardaan diya ki vah asadha shukla paksh kii ekadshi se karthik shukla paksh kii ekadshi tak pataal lok main vaas karenge
 This period of his stay in Hades is considered as Yoganidra
 akali dal−bijepi ne ghapale, ghotaale or bhrashtachar ko badhaava diya he

 Movie Review: jivan ke sangharsh kii kahani he 'traped'laali or laddu kii kisi lav storikahani ek cycle kii dukaan chalaane vaale (darshan jarivaala) ke mahatvakankshi bete laddu ( vivaan shah) kii he jo jindagi main kuch bada karne or paise kamaane ke liye baroda jaataa he
 Here he meets Lali (akshara Hasan)
 inkaa pyaar shaadi tak pahunchane se pehle bed par pahunch jaataa he or laali pregnent ho jaati he
 Review: The twist in the 'anarkali of Aara' story, presenting the serious issue in an excellent way, comes when Laddoo leaves Lali while choosing his career
 lekin laali 70 ke dashak vaali nahin he, vah bina byaah kiye laddu ke mata pita ke paas chali jaati he
 However, Laddoo's emotions kill Hilore and he comes back
 lekin isi bich laali kii shaadi kunwar vir (gurmeet choudhary) se fiks ho jaati he or kahani main lav triengal ban jaataa he
 This model has such fun in the eyes, there are thousands of them, some crazy feel, while reading the story, you must be feeling crazy what is in it

 The main reason for this is that the US economy has started strengthening

 The way the South African team lost in the first T20 match
 dekhakar kaha ja saktaa he ki vanade main team india ne jeet kii jis raah ko pakadi thi usapar chalate hue tii-20 siries par bhi kabja jamaa legi
 The bat of Gabbar (shikhar Dhawan) thundered a lot in this match
 jisase bharat ne 203 ranon kaa pahaad jaisaa score khadaa kar diya
 The first T20 match in Johannesburg, then Shikhar Dhawan was not missing any chance of cheering Team India, he did not wait for the weak balls
 chote formet main bade-bade shots jamaakar pehle tii 20 main hi unhone dakshin africa kii batti gul karne ke saare intjaam kar die
 All the corners of the field were filled with his shots, then Team India scored 78 runs in the powerplay, which is the highest powerplay score in India's T20 history
 dhawan ne 39 gendon par 72 ran bana daale
 At one end, wickets were falling at intervals of a few consecutive runs, at the other end Shikhar Dhawan was troubling the African bowlers with his brilliant shots
 dhawan ne 72 ranon kii pari main 10 chauke or 2 chakke jamaaye
 The target of 204 runs from the foundation of Gabbar, the batting batting of Team India's big score in the way not only disappointed the South African camp but the middle order batsmen also came on the field with high spirits
 viraat kohli ne 26 ran kii pari kheli, jabaki manish pandey ne naabad 29 ran banaae
 The result of this fast batting was that Team India scored a big score of 203 against South Africa
 bhuvi kii gendbaaji kaa kaharascore board par 203 ran tangte hi dakshin africa ke liye jeet aasaan nahin tha
 African batsmen hit the ground to hit the target of 204 runs
 lekin wo kabhi match main vaapasi karte nahin dikhe
 Because Indian paceman Bhuvneshwar Kumar did not let the African batsmen stay at the crease
 ek-ek kar bhuvi ne paanch ballabaajon ko pavilion kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 We can say that Shikhar Dhawan batted hard and Bhuvneshwar Kumar took 5 wickets to ensure the victory of Team India
 or phir kohli kii sena ne 28 ran se pehle tii-20 main jeet hasil kar lee
 With this, India has also taken a 1-0 lead in the 3-match series
 vaise se is match main team india ke sabhi khilaadiyon se shandaar pradarshan rahaa, lekin shikhar dhawan or bhubaneshwar kumaar is match ke asli hero hai

 This initiative has been done by the number one news channel Aaj Tak of the country

 In this program, she talks to music personalities on her journey of life, her initial training in music, COO of Lifestyle Section of India Today Group and Mala Sekhari, Head of Music Today
 hamane maala sekhri se janaa is sho ke concept ke bare main, kaise ye program ab tak mujeec field kii hastiyon par bane duusare tivi program se bilkul alahada he or aage isamen koun si lay or taal najar aaengi
 How i have been thinking about the melodious thing, heading the Life Style section for years
 is dauraan kai singrs compogers se milanaa hota tha
 Being the head of Music Today, there were talks with many classical, folk and film musicians and singers
 inamen se kai mere achche dost hai
 Whenever they meet, i would notice one thing
 mere duusare dost inase inaki shakhsiyat se bas gaanon ke jariye rubaru hote
 It would have been something like that, sir, what wonderful line you have sung
 bas ek baar gunaguna dijie
 Or what tune is made
 kahaan se aayaa iskaa khyaal
 But it came to my mind that these singers who are musicians, they listen to their songs, their music, but they hear that they grew up, became, reached this place, there is no information about it
 yahi shuruyaat thi sureeli baat kii, is nai soch kii
 Singer is singing in songs of others
 We tried to make guests who came
 ve apane bachapan, apni shuruaati taiyaariyon or un gaanon ke bare main baat karen, jinhen radio par, tivi par yaa tepe recorder par sunakar unhone riyaj kiya
 It was clear here that singers or composers fall into two categories
 ek hai shafakat jaise, gharaane se taalluk rakhte
 From childhood, he used to practice hard in the company of the master
 duusare hai ke
 K
 yaa sunidhi kii tarah
 Lived with siblings in a normal middle class family and learned by listening
 to ye jo seekhney kaa kram tha, ise jaananaa behad jaruri bhi tha or darshakon ke lihaaj se sochen to kuch taazgi bharaa bhi
 Keeping this in mind, we are not only asking singers about their childhood, early Riyaz in melodious talk
 balki un gaanon ko bhi sun rahe hai, jinhen gaakar unhone sur saadhe
 It is very different
 shaan kishor kaa gaanaa gaayen yaa sunidhi lata ji ko gunagunaayein
 This shows a picture of that mind, the time when our today's singing superstars were getting ready
 jab ve ek tepe yaa record ko vaise hi jatan se rakhte the, sambhalate the, sunate the, jaise koi or baccha kisi khilone ko
 Keep the bike or favorite gadget
 takalluf kis baat kaa, ye baat hi to hesurili baat main darshak jo ek baat note karenge vah ye he ki yahaan na to singer or na hi ankar ke expressant banaavati najar aaenge
 They will not be seen because nothing is fake on the set or during the shoot
 isiilie na camere kii lokation kii parvaah he na is baat kii ki amuman intervyuu karne vaala vahiin baithe baithe gaanon par jhuumane nahin lagata
 This is a matter of honest face to face, adorned with songs, music
 aise main agar kisi gane par pair thirakate hon, to unhen to najar aana hi he
 That is why there is a lot of candid moments in the melodious thing
 de tali vaala andaaj he
 Sukhwinder is a fun-filled naughty boy (mala Sekhari shared the experience of the first episode, in which Sukhwinder Singh was a guest), was the first episode with Sukhwinder
 wo shoot ke liye aayaa or gale milakar muskuraate hue bolaa, kaise hai aap
 i felt that this is a definite Punjabi
 bade dil vaala
 Loud and happy mood
 aap gaur se dekhen to najar aayega ki sukhwinder kii ankhon main masti he
 Every expression appears there
 usamen bhi 90 fisadi masti he
 Meaning it is something similar that i am cool dude
 khush hum apni life se, kaam se
 What to show me or yahi bhav mere dimag main ghanaa hota rahaa apisod kii shooting ke teen ghanton ke dauraan
 What happened during the shoot? gane hue
 Jokes happened
 sab kuch bahut mjedaar tha
 i never felt that he was trying to make a special image of himself or to strengthen the image made
 wo jaisaa tha usamen bahut sahaj tha
 Clothes, hair, conversation personality
 jo he so he
 It was not that i should be like this, it should be like that
 uskaa hisaab bahut saaf he
 This is my music, such is my personality, you ask me what you want to ask
 magar is safagoi ke saath masti kaa masala bhi mila hua he
 As soon as Sukhwinder gets a chance to talk, he will adopt a funny style
 joke daag degaa
 The same thing was happening in the shoot
 main usase boli bhi ki you aar e brat
 And he said with a laugh that yes i am
 acchhee baat ye rahi ki sukhwinder main koi hichak nahin
 Will sing whatever you say
 phir bich shoot main hi bolne laga ki are aap to kuch bhi gavaa lo
 You made my mood so good with this conversation
 is intervyuu ke dauraan ek kism kii urja thi
 When i went home after the shoot, it seemed that i met a new good person today
 jisase baat karnaa acha laga
 Nice to know about
 tailent kaa khajaana he sukkhisukhwinder kii ek image he public main, khanak bhare numbers se judi
 Then whether it is the heart of the moon, the rhythm of Ramta Jogi or the slum dog Millionaire
 magar ek doosraa sukhwinder bhi he
 Having a strong grip on classics
 lanbaa aalaap lene vaala
 No answer even in soulful romantic songs
 wo compoger bhi he
 He has an understanding of music

 dharmanagari haridwar main sadhu-santon ke bich khooni jang aam baat ho chuki he
 This battle is taking place on thousands of acres of land, property and offerings in dozens of monasteries of 13 Akharas here
 pichley paanch saal main is khooni ladaai main ab tak 29 mahanton kii hatya ho chuki he
 But the police have got the clue of only four of these murders and they have caught the people involved in these murders
 police ne mahant sudhir giri kii hatya ke aarope main jis hatyare ko dabocha, use property dealer bataaya gaya he
 Socialist of Haridwar j
 pi
 "the practice of illegally selling the lands of the akhadas and monasteries in Haridwar is very old," says Badoni
 isi bhoomi kii kharid-farokht ko lekar hatyaein bhi hoti hai
 "they state that the devotees donated thousands of acres of land at different times to 13 akhadas, which should not have been used for commercial use
 lekin hua iskaa ulataa
 Instead of propagating Sanatan Dharma, commercial construction is being done on this land of the Akharas and they are turning into places to earn profits
 badoni kehete hai, ''sari ladaai is munaafe kii bandarbaant kii he
 "today large guest houses, hotels and apartments have been erected on the land of the arena
 kai akhaadon ke bheetar vyavsaayik complex bhi ban gaye hai
 However, wherever they have been given the form of a hotel, there is a game of avoiding giving revenue to the government by naming it as Sevasadan or Ashram
 daan kii jameen se vyavsaayik hitaharidwar sthit june akhaade kii jameen par guest house bana hua he
 This land was donated by 4 cars and religious lovers
 makasad yah tha ki yahaan deshbhar se aane vaale sadhu, dharmarhnak or tirthayatri ni:shulk thahar saken
 But the guest house built here is commercial
 ise kiraye par diya jaataa he
 a similar case is the Sri Dutt guesthouse
 june akhaade ke mayadevi mandir ke saamne bhi daan kii jameen par bahumanjila apartment bana hua he
 In this apartment, people have been given houses on rent
 in makaanon kii kirayedari aajanm he or iske liye kirayedaron se aghoshit rup se lakhon rupye vasule jate hai
 They are neither registered nor property transferred
 yadi kirayedar kisi ko yah sampatti dena chahta he to phir se akhaade ke mahant se kirayedari karaani padati he, jisamen mahant phir kuch lakh rupye lekar nai kirayedari de detaa he
 The revenue of the government is killed by this
 yahi vivaad is apartments main bhi he
 Mahant Sudhir Giri was killed only when he opposed the attempt to rag the property of the Kankhal's magnate court, though the killer was later apprehended
 kankhal ke hi muhalla mayana main manorampura naam se sarvaadhik flats bane hai
 The indifferent arena here is also accused of building commercial flats and raising huge sums from many tenants
 (haridwar main niranjani akhaade kii jameen par ban rahi bahumanjila imaarat)kamai kaa dhan dharm kaary ke liehalanki akhaadon ke mahant is tarah ke aaropon se saaf inkaar karte hai
 They have their own arguments
 jaise udasin akhaade ke sachiv mangaladaar kankhal main ban rahe commercial flats se sambandhit aarope ko galat bataate hue kehete hai, ''akhaade kii bhoomi par flats kaa nirmaan kaary abhi chal rahaa he
 It is wrong to sell them
 ham unhen kiraye par kaise dete hai, yah mahant bhagatraam ji bataa sakate hai
 "but Mahant Bhagatram is never available to comment
 isi tarah june akhaada ke mahant premanand giri kehete hai, ''jahaan bhi ashram yaa akhaadon kii bhoomi par hotel yaa atithi grih banaae jate hai, uski aamadani se akhaade ke saadhuon kii seva hoti he
 The hungry, helpless and poor are supported in the ashram-linked ashrams
 " premanand giri bataate hai ki pehle raja-maharaja saadhuon kii seva karte the or unhen aarthik madad dete the
 Now the akharas have to do everything by themselves
 ve kehete hai, ''haa, ham dhan kama rahe hai, lekin us dhan ko dharm-karm main hi kharch kar rahe hai
 What is the harm in this? "where is the full account of income expenditure incurred on renting a big turban to build big apartments and rent them? If not, why? When India Today asked questions to Premanand Giri, He said, "I have answers to all the questions, but at the moment i am busy with the preparations for the Kumbh in Trimbakeshwar
" "dharm ke naam par chhuikhaadon ke mahant mahamandaleshwar apane öbhav kaa öyoga karte hue shahar kii athurity se apane akhaadon main dharmashala yaa ashram ke rup main bade-bade nakshe paas karvaa lete hai
 Then in these alleged ashrams and dharamshalas, people are charged with fat turban and put on rent
 haridwar main jin pramukh 13 akhaadon kii hajaaron acre bhoomi he, unke deshbhar ke tirthasthalon jaise vrundavan, ujjain, gaya, kuruhnetra, elahabaad, nasik, ayodhya aadi tirthasthanon par bhi bade-bade bhukhand hai
 There are akhadas in Haridwar and dharamshalas in Rishikesh
 kaali kamali vaale kii dharmashala ho yaa punjab sindh kshetra kii dharmashala yaa garib das ji kii dharmashala, sab main yahaan care tekar ke rup main tainaat manageron ne jameen ko kathith taur par oune-paune daam main bechaa he
 This led to loss of revenue to the state government and also loss of revenue to be recovered as registry fee
 haridwar vikaas praadhikaran ko milane vaale vikaas shulk ko bhi iske jariye maaf kara liya jaataa he
 The game does not end here
 bijli pani ke conection par dharmashalaon or ashramon ko chhot milti he
 RTI activist Ajay Sharma from Haridwar says, "the hotels built in the name of ashrams and dharamshalas in the akhadas have been given on contract
 itnaa hi nahin, yahaan bade-bade shopping mal banaakar dukaanon se motaa kiraaya vasula jaataa he
 "(apartment standing on the ground of the big arena in Kankhal) The sluggish role of the police is going on rampant, but why is the police and administration calm? Sanjay Gunjyal, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Garhwal Region, says that during his stay as SSP of Haridwar The work of enlisting the disputed trusts and ashrams, which had complained of the land being gutted
 aise kai treston par roak bhi lagi
 But it did not last long
 gunjyaal kehete hai, ''is tarah ke kaam thode lambey or pechide hote hai
 The police need to work more effectively to prevent loot of land in the name of religion
 "badmaashon ke bal par mahanton dwaara vibhinn akhaadon or mathon main chaddar olyde kaa khel bhi khelaa jaataa he
 Once the cover is put up and the Mahant gets the throne of the abbot, then on the strength of this cover, he earns a lot of money within a few days
 chaddar chadhaane ke pehle kathith mahanton ke puraane itihaas ko khangaalane kii koi jarurat nahin mahasoos kii jaati
 The disciples also do not miss killing their master to make the cover of the throne
 pichley paanch saal main yahaan 29 mahanton kii hatya ho chuki he
 a few years ago the news of Ramdev's disappearance of Guru Shankar Dev from Kankhal Ashram in Haridwar was in the news
 maamle kii sibiai jaanch ke baavjood is gumshudagi kaa aaj tak kuch pataa nahin lag sakaa
 Many such cases have been seen in Haridwar
 dharm or tirth kii yah nagari lagaataar hatya, aparaadh or sampatti ke maamalon main jaalsaji or dhokhadhadi kaa adda banati ja rahi he
 Despite 29 murders one after the other, the revealing of four murders by the police itself raises many questions
