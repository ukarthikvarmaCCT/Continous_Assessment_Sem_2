 In this address, he told the Muslim community that they too should reject fundamentalism and terrorism

 -input language nirbhaya ke hatyare kii punarvichaar yachika par SC main hogi sunwaayee18 disambar tak nahin hua koi faisla ko latak saktaa he maamla18 disambar ke baad court paanch janvari 2020 tak sardi kii chhuttiyannirbhaya ke hatyare kab latakaae jaaenge? saat saal ho gayi is sawaal se jujhate hue
 But the answer was not found
 kyonki lag to yahi rahaa he ki pench isi 'latakaae' jane ko lekar fansaa hua he
 However, whether the public or the lawyers of Nirbhaya's killers, both want to 'hang' it
 bas donon ke latakaane main fark sirf itnaa he ki janata in darindon ko faansee ke takhte par latakaana chaahati he or vakil court ke takht par is maamle ko latakaane kii jaddojehad main jute hai
 In these seven years, by taking advantage of the holes and cracks present in our law, all those who have been doing black black beekeepers have been resorting to all the upside down
 ab janata kaa sabar bhi jawaab dene laga he
 Even in Parliament, it is being said that when there is so much malfunction in our system, why not hand over such poor people to the people and the public should be punished
 sunne main ye jangal raaj or andhaa kanoon lag saktaa he lekin kadavi sachai to yahi he
 Now let's talk about what is the scene of hanging them
 to sahab ye samaj lijiye ki 16 disambar ko kisi bhi surat main faansee nahin hone ja rahi he
 Because the important hearing in the Supreme Court is to be held on 17 December
 jab maamla bada hota he to use lekar ulti sidhi afvaahen bhi udati hai
 People become active on social media by taking advantage of the eagerness of the public
 2020 tak `latak' saktaa he maamlaphilhal to yah bhi afvaah udani shuru ho gai he ki 16 disambar nahin to 29 disambar ko faansee hogi
 That is, the day this scandal took place on December 16 and the day Nirbhaya's breath broke, that is December 29
 lekin sab kuch bahut hi fast yani tej raftaar se hoga tabhi 29 disambar kii ded line par yah kaam ho saktaa he
 Otherwise, the matter may again be 'hanging' by 2020
 17 disambar ko sunwaayee ke baad 18 disambar ko punarvichaar yachika par faisla aa gaya to thik varna court agle 18 dinon ke liye band
 The Supreme Court will open on 6 January after the winter holidays
 hamaara kanoon jaghanya apradhi ko bhi apane bachaav ke teen ahm maukey detaa he

 patiala house main 'fast trek' court ne bhi nirbhaya kii maa aashaa devi kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue kah diya he ki pehle supreme court is maamle main aadesh de de to phir yahaan sunwaayee aage badhaai jaay
 The same thing has been happening for the last seven years
 jo kuch tikadambajiyaan nirbhaya se amanviya kukrity karne vaale in hatyaron ke vakeelon ne kii hai unka kaccha-chittha patiala house court main jaj satish aroda ne aaj khol kar rakh diya
 He asked the lawyer of these murderers, AP Singh, that you were always engaged in tricks and jugaad to hang the case
 kai baar aap khud adaalat nahin pahunche
 Sometimes by some pretext, sometimes by someone
 aapane samay rahete kanoonee upaay nahin kiye jabaki hamane maheenon pehle aapako aagaah bhi kar diya tha
 Instead of putting together reconsideration petitions in the Supreme Court on behalf of all the culprits, you took turns in a thoughtful move so that you can cut the time
 aap dayaa yachikaaon ke maamle main bhi yahi khel khelnaa chaahate hai
 That is, the trial court is also convinced by this clever approach of the lawyers of the criminals
 vakil ne court ko bataaya- do hathiyaar abhi bachekyde se in aparaadhiyon ko jaldi se jaldi sajaa-e-maut dene kii yachika nirbhaya kii maa kii ore se lagaai gai
 Asha Devi told the Patiala House Court that a death warrant should be issued against her now
 isse pehle court ne tihaad jail prashasan se report maangi ki court ke paas in chaaron kii ore se kahin koi yachika lambit rahane kii soochna nahin he lihaaja kyon naa inako di gai sajaa par amal kar diya jaae
 At this, the lawyers of these killers, AP Singh and others came into action
 unhone naa keval supreme court main ek doshi akshay singh kii ore se punarvichaar yachika daayar kii balki trial court ko bhi bataaya ki abhi hadabadane kii jarurat nahin he
 They still have two weapons
 idhar court ne hadakaayaa udhar supreme court main ek vakil sunil kumaar ne janhit yachika daayar kii gai ki court in aparaadhiyon ko maheene bhar ke bheetar sajaa-e-maut dena sunishchit kare
 Because despite the fast track court, this case is still pending for the last seven years
 yani sajaa kaa intjaar khatm hi nahin hua he
 Sunil Kumar has also said in his petition that a live telecast of the hanging of these poor should also be done
 isamen agar koi baadha yaa aapatti ho to nirbhaya ke parijanon ko vahaan jail main faansee ke vakt maujuud hone kii ijaajat jarur mili
 The wait is currently on how fast the hearing in the Supreme Court on 17 December settles
 kyonki 18 disambar ke baad court paanch janvari 2020 tak sardi kii chhuttiyon ke liye band ho jayega

 narendra modi bihar ke nahin hai, lekin is baar bihar main chunaav modi ke naam ke hi ird-gird ghoomegaa
 Its board has been set
 jis tej aawaaj main nitish kumaar se lekar jediu kaa har vidhayak modi kaa naam aate hi bifer rahaa he, usase lagane laga he ki modi chunavi mudda ho jaaen, aisa nitish bhi chaahate hai
 One important reason behind this is that if the image of Modi in Bihar becomes anti-muslim, then 17 percent of the Muslim voters of the state will fall in the bag of those opposing Modi outright
 aise main nitish kaa sankat yah he ki bijepi or aresas pehle se lalu yadav ke nishane par rahe hai or muslim voter ise achche se samajhate hai
 In such a situation, Nitish Kumar wants to take Modi's opposition to a level before breaking the alliance where his Modi opposition becomes bigger than the BJP and the Sangh
 gathbandhan todane se pehle nitish ke liye aisa karnaa isaliye jaruri he, kyonki godhra cond ho yaa gujarat hinsa, nitish endie main naa sirf bane rahe, balki bataur cabinet mantri malai khate rahe, or ab unhen modi virodh ke sur se apane puraane samjhauton par red karpet bichhaani he
 If this does not happen, then Nitish will also have to face the crisis of his own mps, who have to contest again in 2014
 kyonki jediu ke 20 saansadon kii jeet ke peeche bijepi kaa 13 fisadi oonchi jati kaa vot bank bhi he
 If bjp's upper caste voter is not with JDU then it will be difficult for their candidates
 yani gathbandhan tutaa to nitish kii sarkaar par to aanch nahin aegi, lekin 2014 kii daud main nitish haankene jarur lagenge
 And if the question also arises on the Third Front or Federal Front, then Nitish will come in the role of a small player, because he can have Mulayam Singh, Mayawati, Mamta Banerjee, Naveen Patnaik, Jayalalithaa and Chandrasekhar of Telangana in the list of big players and The road to NDA again will also be narrow

 '' sabha main sadhvi ne kaha, ''maine use kaha tha tera sarvanaash hoga, usne mujhe gaaliyaan di thim

 To understand how much the Kolkata Knight Riders' team relied on Sunil Narine's bowling, it has to be seen that without Sunil Narine, the Kolkata team had threatened not to participate in Season 8
 aanan-fanan main bisisiai ne sunil naren kaa test karakar unke ection ko paas kiya or ipel ke star gendbaaz sunil naren kii team main vaapasi ho gai
 Sunil Narine was banned during the Champions League last year due to questionable bowling action and due to this ban, he could not even participate in the World Cup
 cricket maidan par sunil naren kii vaapasi to ho rahi thi, lekin sabase bada sawaal yahi tha ki kya badale hue ection ke saath naren prabhavi gendbaaj bane rahenge
 In the first match, Sunil Narine did not show the former magic
 unhen gautam gambhir ne saatven over main gendbaazi par lagaaya tab mumbai ke teen wicket gir chuke the
 The very first ball was sent by Rohit Sharma across the boundary
 naren ne is match main 4 overon kii gendbaaji kii or 28 ran die
 He did not get any wickets
 tii-20 mukaable main ye koi karaab ausat nahin he, lekin naren to isse bhi kifayati gendbaaz ke taur par mashhoor rahe hai
 Naren's bowling was instrumental in making Kolkata the IPL champion in 2012
 15 maichon main sabase zyada 24 wicket chatka kar ve main of da toornament bane the
 In 2013 too, he took 22 wickets while in 2014, when the team once again became the champion, Naren had 21 wickets in his name
 is record ko dekhte hue hi saurav ganguli jaise diggaj unhen ipel main trump card maanate hai
 But all this happened when Sunil Narine was considered a mystery bowler
 unki spin ballebaazon ko na keval chakma detii thi balki pavilion kaa rasta bhi dikhaati thi
 Will this happen now? Will Sunil Naren's magic prevail? No results can be reached on the basis of a single match, but according to NDTV cricket expert Dean Jones, the bowling power of bowlers decreases with the changed bowling
 haalanki dean jones mumbai ke khilaaf sunil naren kii gendbaazi ko kaaphi behatar maanate hai, lekin ve said ajmal or sanchithra senanayake kaa udhaaharan dete hue kehete hai ki badale hue ection ke saath pehle vaala jaadu nahin rah paata
 However, according to Dean Jones, Sunil Narine will get a chance to warm up in two-three matches as he has been away from the cricket field for a long time
 kolkata niterides kheme ko ummid hogi sunil naren ko bhi jaldi lay main laut aaenge

 jiesti or notebandi se zyada pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bharat kii air strike arvind ko sabase sahi faisla lagata he
 The youth who came from Laharvijay Nagar formed by Air Strike also believe that after the Air Strike, Modi's wave has started again not only in Ajmer but also in entire Rajasthan
 chandan or dhiraj kaa maananaa he ki jo faisle modi lete hai vah 70 saalon main duusare netaa nahin le paae
 Dheeraj believes that the BJP lost in the assembly elections because the issues were different then Chandan says that when the Lok Sabha elections are held then the face of Modi and not the candidate will be straight because the issues will also change
 isi shahar ke kirodi nagar ko lagata he ki 2014 se lekar 2019 main kuch khaas badlaav nahin najar aayaa kyonki naukarshahi ke chalate ho saktaa he modi jo karnaa chaahate hon, vah puraa na ho paaya ho
 Santosh Kumar says that not a single promise has been fulfilled

 Kirodi Nagar feels that unemployment will be the biggest issue, then Santosh says that the road and water system is bad while business has also sat down
 nakul jaise yuvaaon ko lagata he ki wing commander abhinandan kii vaapasi bhi modi ke chalate sambhav hui
 Most people believe that after the air strike, there was a big change in the politics of Rajasthan
 haalanki kuch logon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki air strike kii charchaa kii vajah se baaki masalon par charchaa kahin na kahin dab gai or vikaas ke mudde peeche rah gaye
 What is the opinion of the Muslims, along with political opinion with Ramai Fatekhar, Mumtaz Ali, Anwar and Danish, their opinions on Ramadan, Air Strike, Modi and elections were known
 zyaadaatar musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki is chunaav main modi kaa naam or unka cheharaa sabase aage hoga
 Mumtaz Ali, a teacher by profession, believes that even though the BJP has lost in Rajasthan in the assembly elections, the mood seems to be in Modi's favor
 iftekhaar ko bhi lagata he ki lahar bhale hi modi ke paksh main he lekin jitani ummiden 2014 main thim, ummiido par sarkaar 2019 tak khari nahin utari
 Anwar believes that Modi's face will dominate in this election because the question will be who we are giving the leadership of the country to
 anwar ko lagata he ki modi ji is maamle main philhal awwal hai
 Brother Danish feels that people will like Modi more than Rahul Gandhi
 5 saalon ke kaamkaaj par raay rakhte hue danish kaa kahana he ki vikaas ke kaam kuch nahin hue lekin shauchalay jarur banaae gaye
 Anwar feels that the promises made in 5 years were not fulfilled because neither employment was found nor business progressed
 mumtaj ali ko lagata he ki 5 saal main yuva berozegaar ho gaye, kaamkaaj thap ho gaya
 If the condition of the farmers deteriorated, nothing happened
 mumtaj kaa maananaa he ki 5 saalon main sirf or sirf chunaav jeetne ke liye jumalebaji hui
 Iftekhar feels that in 5 years the average performance is fine but as expected, for development, those expectations are not fulfilled but he agrees with Prime Minister Modi's Jan Dhan Yojana and GST as well as demonetization policy
 kya musalmaan modi ko 2019 main vot denge? danish kaa kahana he ki lokapriyata nahin balki kaam ko dekhakar vot denge
 Anwar feels that Muslims too can vote for Modi to a great extent
 vahi mumtaj ali ko lagata he ki is baar musalmaan bhi modi ko vot de sakate hai lekin musalamaanon ke majahab main dakhal chaahe wo teen talaak kaa maamla ho yaa bheed ke naam par hinsa, usase musalmaan kahin na kahin peeche hat saktaa he
 Sunday also feels that the incidents of mob lynching have frightened the Muslims
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar ne kuch bhi nahin kiya
 Danish says the air strike decision was a good one and Modi did what he did
 anwar ko lagata he ki is kadam main hamen thodi deree kar di jabaki aisi kaarywahi pehle kerani chahie thi taaki hamale or aatanki gatividhiyaan roki ja saken
 Mumtaz Ali says that if our army did the air strike, then every country should take action
 mumtaj ali kaa kahana he ki islam aatankwaad ke khilaaf he or khun bahaane ke liye ijaajat nahin detaa
 Iftekhar also feels that the Indian Army's Airstrike was strong
 muslim yuvaaon kaa maananaa he ki air strike jaisaa kadam pehle uthaanaa chahie tha
 Has the political scenario in Rajasthan, including Ajmer, changed after the air strike? In response to this, Mumtaz Ali feels that if this action had been taken earlier, terror would have given a befitting reply but before the elections its discussion seems to be intent on influencing the election somewhere
 ajmer jahaan musalamaanon ke liye paak he, vahiin isi loksabhaa se laga ek chota sa shahar pushkar hinduon kaa ek prasiddh tirthasthal he
 Many big central government schemes were implemented for Ajmer Lok Sabha constituency, but the claims of development on the ground reality appear to be less and more real on paper
 deen dayaal parashar pushkar ke nivasee hai or aarope he ki kisi bhi sarkaar ne pushkar ke liye yojanaon kii ghoshnaa se itar koi kaam nahin kiya
 It is said that Pushkar does not have clean drinking water, roads are broken in 2 months
 halaat main koi badlaav nahin he isliye matdaan ke samay log muddon ko jehan main rakhenge
 However, Deendayal also believes that when there are issues, there will be no choice before Modi when people go to vote, so people will vote for Modi
 rajesh banjaaraa jaise log maanate hai ki modi kii videsh niti thik he lekin jitna badlaav hona chahie tha vah badlaav nahin hua
 Therefore, in this election, if Narendra Modi gets a chance again, then the expectations can be fulfilled
 rajvir singh rathod or surendra mashina jaise yuvaaon ko bhi lagata he ki modi sarkaar ke dauraan unke gaanv main vikaas dikhaai diya
 If the poor get a house in their village, then they also have toilets for cleanliness
 35 saal se rajasthan kii raajnneeti ko kareeb se dekh rahe nandu maanate hai ki pakistan main hui air strike ke chalate desh hi nahin balki rajasthan kaa upachunaav bhi prabhavit hua he jisase puraane mudde peeche chhot gaye hai
 People believe that Modi Factor will be the biggest card
 haalanki unka yah bhi maananaa he ki local raajnneeti ummidavaaron par bhi nirbhar karegi
 Nandu ji also believes that Muslim voters will play a decisive role this time
 ajmer ki is ground report se yah samajha ja saktaa he ki is baar ke chunaav main sthaneey mudde charchaa main bhale hi hon lekin air strike se raajnneetik paridrishy badla hua he jisamen pradhanmantri modi ne muddon ko peeche chhod diya he

 Without Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshi Ram, the party's national president Mayawati is going through the most difficult phase of her political life
 loksabhaa chunaav main ek bhi seat na jeetne vaali bispi iske baad hue maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand or jammu-kashmir ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi hathi nahin dauda saki
 For the first time in the last 25 years, the bsp's national party strength is facing a serious crisis
 isse nibatane ke liye mayawati ne ek baar phir party kii marammat kaa rasta akhriyaar kiya he
 Jugal Kishore was once the most powerful zonal coordinator of BSP among Mayawati's most trusted close
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main jaise hi bispi ke dalit votbank main kuch daraar dikhi, kishor par mayawati kii nazren tedi ho gayi
 Since Jugal Kishore would retain his Rajya Sabha membership if he was expelled from the party, on 3 January, Mayawati withdrew all organizational responsibilities from this rebel MP
 jugal kishor kehete hai, ''mayawati dalit kii nahin, daulat kii beti hai
 In BSP, Rs 50 lakh to two crores are charged for assembly election ticket
 mujhe iskaa virodh karne kii sajaa mili
 Seeing the rebellious attitude of Jugal Kishore, the BSP put forward two of its toughest leaders, Swami Prasad Maurya and Nasimuddin Siddiqui, for 'damage Control'
 maury aarope lagaate hai, ''jugal kishor ke number do ke vyavsaay main enarechaem ghotaale ke aaropee babu singh kushvaha kaa paisa laga hua he
 They can go to BJP to avoid scrutiny
 '' baharhaal, in sabake bich mayawati party ke bheetar bade badlaavon kii bhoomika taiyaar karne main vyast hai
 Kinaramayavati is also focusing her attention on Dalit leaders to distance the party from such people, who may cause problems within the organization in future
 chaahe ve dalit hi kyon na hon

 "the strategy behind announcing the removal of the leaders with public names is that the other party also avoided to cover them secretly," says a party zonal coordinator

 Meanwhile, Mayawati is deliberately running her political pieces
 philhal unhone kisi bahari netaa ko party main shaamil karne kii hadabadi nahin dikhaai he
 Mayawati, who is preparing for the 2017 assembly elections, has indicated not to pay attention to outside leaders by declaring more than 70 percent of the BSP candidates as possible candidates

 lekin kaha jaataa he ki raajnneeti main kuch bhi sthaayee nahin hota to aage kya hoga isaki bhavishyavaanee bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 During his press conference, Fadnavis made it clear that Uddhav Thackeray never proposed a two-and-a-half-year CM to me during his press conference
 haalanki unhone iske saath hi yah bhi kaha ki agar yah baat amit shah ke saath hui hogi to vah mujhe pataa nahin he
 Fadnavis further said that Mahayuti had good seats after the elections
 ham log baith kar is maamle ko sulajhaa sakate the lekin unka rukh discshan kaa nahin tha
 Those people started making rhetoric from day one
 press conference ke dauraan shivasena par 'vishwasghaat' kaa aarope lagaate hue fadanvis ne kaha, "main unase milane bhi gaya, phone bhi kiya lekin unhone ek bhi phone risive nahin kiya
 After the result, we had continuous discussions with Congress and NCP but did not even talk to us
 " iske saath hi shivasena ke anya netaaon ke vyavhaar par ungali uthaate hue fadanvis ne kaha, "uddhav thakare ke aasapaas ke log jis tarah baat karte hai us tarah kii baat se sarkaar nahin banati
 Negotiations could resolve the dispute
 kuch logon ne rigelt aane ke din se hi bayaanbaji shuru kar di thi
 Bal Thackeray is respected for us, that's why we never made any derogatory talk
 "uddhav thakare ne fadanvis ko diya karaara javaabashivsena kii taraf se pehle party ke varisht netaa sanjay raut ne fadanvis kii tamaam baton kaa khandan kiya
 After that, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also came in front of the media and presented his stand on all the issues one by one and made it clear that lies were lied on behalf of BJP and i do not talk about lies
 iske saath hi uddhav thakare ne ek baar phir doharaaya ki maine apane pita ko vachan diya he ki ek din shivasainik ko maharashtra kaa siem banaaunga or us par main aaj bhi atal hum
 In his press conference, while defending Fadnavis, Uddhav said, "everyone knows who lies
 gathbandhan ko lekar hamaari kya charchaa chal rahi thi uski bhi baat kariye, juthi baat mat failaaiye
 My promise to my father was that i would one day lead a Shiv Sena man to the post of Chief Minister and i stood by it
 pichley 25 saal tak ham isi baat par adte rahe ki jisaki seat zyada rahegi vahi siem banegaa
 Had a talk with Amit Shah
 unhen spasht karnaa chahie
 "he further said," BJP should stop fooling the people of Maharashtra
 dushyant chautaala ne kaha tha ki do gujarati hamen rashtrawaad bataaenge lekin hamane aisa kuch nahin kaha
 While cleaning their Ganges, our mind became dirty
 satta ke nashe main chur he bhaajapa
 Dirt has entered the mind of BJP
 ram ke ek vachan par kaayam nahin rah sakate
 The Sangh should clarify whether we are not a Hindu party
 "fadanvis ke phone vaali baat kaa jawaab dete hue fadanvis ne kaha ki mere paas vakt tha or main baat kar saktaa tha lekin main jhooth bolne waalon se baat nahin karata
 PM Modi calls me younger brother and BJP cheats me
 logon ko amit shah and company par koi bharosa nahin he
 i will not make any further mistake iske saath hi bijepi ko ultimatum dete hue uddhav ne kaha ki bijepi sarkaar banaae nahin to hamaare vikalp khule hai
 Maharashtra needs a government as farmers are troubled by drought and excess rainfall
 sawaalon ke jawaab dete hue uddhav thakare ne kaha ki congress or ensipi se maine abhi tak baat nahin kii he
 In Ambad area of nashik district, a 35-year-old man stoned his wife to death on a minor dispute
 ambad police thana ke prabharee madhukar kaad ne bataaya ki guuruuvaar kii raat yah ghatana us samay hui, jab aaropee pandurang maanavtakar ne achaanak gusse main apni patni shobhaa par sote samay pathar se hamalaa kar diya

 ret kaarobaari moti rakam kamaane ke laalach main koi bhi rasta haath se jane nahin dena chaahate hai
 Amid the ban on sand mining in Uttar Pradesh, sand traders in Madhya Pradesh have started looking for ways to earn money
 sadak maarg se dhulaai par pakade jane kii ashanka se ghire ek ret kaarobaari ne rail ke jariye ret dhulaai kaa prayaas kiya, jise prashasan ne naakaam kar diya
 Many districts of Bundelkhand in Madhya Pradesh are bordered by Uttar Pradesh
 iske chalate donon pradeshon ke bich awajahi aasaan he
 Businessmen are taking advantage of this to send sand to Uttar Pradesh because the sand is sold expensive due to the ban on mining
 ek taraf jahaan uttar pradesh main ret ke daam bade hai or vahaan ret milanaa mushkil ho gaya he, vahiin madhya pradesh main ret kaa kaarobaar joro par he
 In this situation, sand traders here in Uttar Pradesh made a strategy to send sand by rail instead of road because there is a possibility of vehicle seizure by sending sand by road
 sutron ke anusaar chhatarpur jile ke ret kaarobaari ne uttar pradesh ke lakhanu tak ret bhejne kii garaj se rail kaa ek rack arakshit karaane ke liye rail vibhaag main aavedan diya or kuch raashi bhi jamaa kara di thi
 The businessman also deposited a large amount of sand at the singhpur-dumra railway station in Chhatarpur district, but his plan failed

 Several vehicles carrying sand were also seized
 khanij adhikari prakaash verma ne shuukravaar ko ieenes ko bataaya ki singhpur-dumra railway stesan par lagbhag 45 damper ret jamaa kii gai thi
 This sand has been illegally extracted from the Mania drain
 is ret ko railway ke rack se uttar pradesh le jaaya janaa tha
 Racks have been booked from Jhansi for sand, but local railway officials are not ready to give information
 verma ne bataaya ki chaar damper ke alaava do alanti mashine bhi jabt kii gai hai
 The accused of sand mining is absconding, the police is searching for him
 verma kaa kahana he ki lagbhag 30 damper ret or stesan tak pahunch jaati to ek rack usase bharaa ja saktaa tha
 a large quantity of sand was taken out of Mania Nala to bring it even
 sutron kaa kahana he ki yah desh main apni tarah kaa pehla aisa maamla he jab ret kaarobaari ne chaandi kaatane ke liye rail kaa rack hi book kara daalaa
 After the first attempt to transport sand by rail failed, there is a stir from sand traders to mafias here

 madhumita hatyakand ke mujrim or upi sarkaar ke purv mantri amarmani treepathi par putravadhu kii hatya kaa iljaam lagaaya ja rahaa he
 His daughter-in-law Sarah died in a car accident
 sara kii maa ne siem akhilesh yadav se milakar maamle kii sibiai jaanch karwaane kii maang kii he
 Sara's mother Seema Singh reached her office to meet Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 9 taarikh ko firozabad main sara kii car durghatana main maut ho gai thi
 The car was driven by Amarmani's son and Sara's husband Amanmani
 seemaa apni beti kii maut ke liye amarmani par shaq kar rahi hai
 His mother is also showing Facebook messages that Sara wrote to her friend that Amanmani beats them and wants to get rid of them
 akhilesh se milane ke baad seemaa singh ne kaha ki maine unase sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he
 He gave complete assurance and said that in all the cases so far, i have done very well
 aapako pataa hoga
 i said on this, i am satisfied and i fully hope that you will ask for a CBI inquiry
 gauratlab he ki sara kii maa kaa kahana he ki aisa kaise mumkin he ki durghatana main sara ko itani chot aae ki uski maut ho gai, lekin amanmani ko kharonch tak nahin ai
 Although there are many such incidents, but there is doubt in the heart of the mother
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki unka har shaq dur kiya jayega
 The comments akhilesh yadav ne is puure maamle par kaha ki main aapako bharosa dilaa rahaa hum ki sarkaar vichaar karegi or ve nirnay legi, jisase ki bahut sari baaten jo saamne aa rahi hai, bilkul saaf ho jaaen
 On the question of security, he said that he will be provided security today
 gauratlab he ki doctor kehete hai ki sara kii maut sadak durghatana se hui, lekin sara ke gharavaalon ko shaq he ki kahin aisa to nahin he ki sara ko car main bithakar car khadde main dhakel di gai ho
 Since Amarmani's sons Amanmani and Sara had married their love without their consent, they are suspecting Amarmani for this
 baharhaal ek taraf se maa kaa dil he, duusari taraf amarmani kaa becoground
 This is the reason for doubt
 sara kii maa seemaa singh mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se milane unke offis pahunchin
 Sara was killed in a car accident on the 9th in Firozabad
 car amarmani ke bete or sara ke pati amanmani chalaa rahe the
 Seema is suspecting Amarmani for her daughter's death
 unki maa fasebuk massej bhi dikhaa rahi hai jo sara ne apni friend ko likhe the ki amanmani unhen maarthe-peetate hai or unase peechha chhudaana chaahate hai
 After meeting Akhilesh, Seema Singh said that i have demanded a CBI inquiry from him
 unhone puraa aashwaasan diya or kaha ki abhi tak jitne bhi maamle hai, unamem maine bahut sahi kaam kiya he
 would you know
 main is par kaha, ji main santusht hum or main puri tarah ummid karti hum ki aap sibiai jaanch ke liye kahenge
 Significantly, Sara's mother says that it is possible that Sara was so hurt in the accident that she died, but Ammani did not even scratch
 haalanki kai baar aise vaakye hote hai, lekin maa ke dil main shaq he
 Akhilesh Yadav said that all his doubts will be removed
 tippaniyan Akhilesh Yadav said on this whole matter that i am assuring you that the government will consider and take those decisions, so that a lot of things which are coming out, should be completely clear
 suraksha ke sawaal par vah bole, ki unhen suraksha aaj hi uplabdh karvaa di jaaegi
 Significantly, the doctors say that Sara died due to a road accident, but Sara's family suspects that it is not possible that Sara was pushed into a car by a car
 chunki amarmani ke bete amanmani or sara ne unki marji ke bina lav marij kii thi isliye ve iske liye amarmani par shaq kar rahe hai
 However, on one side is the mother's heart, on the other side Amarmani's background
 shaq kii vajah yahi he
 His mother is also showing Facebook messages that Sara wrote to her friend that Amanmani beats them and wants to get rid of them
 akhilesh se milane ke baad seemaa singh ne kaha ki maine unase sibiai jaanch kii maang kii he
 He gave complete assurance and said that in all the cases so far, i have done very well

 uttarakhand main chunaav kareeb aane ke saath hi bijepi ke bade netaaon kii peshaani par bal padate ja rahe hai
 After all, why not, because every upheaval in the BJP office seems to revolve only around Vijay Bahuguna
 sutron kii maane to dilli main baithe alaakaman se bahuguna ko sidhaa nirdesh mil rahe hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why all the big leaders of the Congress are joining the BJP, their coronation is being led by Bahuguna himself
 ye alag baat he ki bahuguna is todphod ke liye congress sarkaar kii aguwai kar rahe mukhyamantri harish ravat ko jimmedaar bataa rahe hai
 Vijay Bahuguna, who was elevated to the post of chief minister, rebelled from the same, was handed over the command of Uttarakhand by the Congress high command at a time when Harish Rawat was almost certain to be CM and perhaps a further confrontation between Rawat and Bahuguna This was also the reason for this
 ek vakt congress alaakaman ke kaaphi najadik rahe bahuguna ko 2013 kii aapadaa ke baad siem pad se hatana padaa tha or phir harish ravat ne unki jagah rajya kii bagdor sanbhali
 The growing tussle between the former and the current Chief Minister of the state gradually took such a large form that Bahuguna, along with several other leaders including 2016 cabinet minister Harak Singh Rawat, destabilized the government by saying goodbye to the Congress
 dimag ke dhani vijay bahuguna ab apana sara jor harish ravat ko akelaa chhodane main laga rahe hai
 Believe in Bahuguna himself, this is just the trailer, the picture is still left
 bahuguna ke badhate kad se puraane bhaajapaayiyon ko chintaa?vijay bahuguna ke bijepi main aane se jahaan alaakaman ke raajnneetik arth sadhate dikhen to vahiin duusari ore bijepi ke pradesh netritv kii chintaa ubhar kar saamne aane lagi hai
 If sources are to be believed, the way the rebel clan has increased his grip and stature, the fire of discontent within the BJP has started to ignite
 saalon se bijepi ke jhande kii bulandi kii kaamana karne vaale kai aise bhaajapai hai, jo kahin na kahin khud ko thaga sa mahasoos karne lage hai
 Right inside the tongue, but now the complaints and complaints have started coming inside
 bijepi ke kai netaa yah bhi kehete sune gaye ki bijepi ab dhire-dhire badalati ja rahi he or apane sachche sipaahiyon ko hi pahchaan nahin rahi he
 However, this issue is also an insider of BJP and the leaders and activists who are serious on this issue are also BJP soldiers
 aise main aane vaala vaqt hi batayega ki rajya main camel dobaaraa khil paaegaa yaa nahin
 The Election Commission has challenged political parties accused of tampering electronic voting machines to hack evms
 iske liye EC ne 3 june kii taarikh nishchit kii he, har raajnneetik dal ko hekking ke liye chaar ghante kaa vakt diya jayega
 Political representatives can elect four evms from five states for the challenge
 electronic voting mashiinon main chhedchhad ke aaropon ko dekhte hue chunaav ayog ne aaj ek khaas kaarykram main iviem or vivipieti kaa demo diya, jahaan inase judi sari ashankaon ke niptaare ke liye ayog ne mashiinon ke kaam karne ke tareeke ko dikhaaya
 The Election Commission has also made preparations to openly challenge political parties accusing them of malfunctioning evms
 mukhya chunaav ayukta naseem jaidi ne kaha ki paanch rajyon main chunaav ke baad EVM ko lekar shankaaen uthaai gayi, par kisi bhi party ne ab tak voting mashin se chhedchhad kaa koi thos saboot yaa meterial nahin diya he
 The Election Commission said that from the VVPAT, the voter will see who went to the vote
 EVM ke saath VVPAT ke istemaal se sabhi shankaaen or failaaye gaye bhram dur ho jaaenge
 By the end of next year, the commission will get all vvpats ready
 VVPAT parchiyon kii ginati par bhi ayog vichaar karegaa
 Naseem Zaidi said that the misconception was spread by Bhind but now investigation found that four switches were getting different votes during the demo
 ye demo ke dauraan tha naa ki matdaan ke dauraan hua tha
 evms are stand-alone machines, no frequency receivers, no wireless, wi-fi, Bluetooth, or Internet connection
 vahiin maharashtra local bodies ke chunaav kii jimmedaari sthaneey othirity kii thi
 He also informed the commission after conducting an inquiry that the allegations have no merit
 iviem kii vishwasaneeyata ko lekar kai vipakshi partiyaan lagaataar hamalavar rahi hai
 This program was put in place to clear their doubts about EVM tampering
 mukhya chunaav ayukta naseem jaidi ne beeti 12 may ko is mudde par bulaai sarvadaleey baithak ke baadaiviem main gadabadikie ja sakane ke daawey ko sahi sabit karne kii chunauti dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The official said all seven national parties and 48 state-level parties were called by the commission to participate in the open challenge
 iske liye ayog chunauti main shaamil hone ke icchhuk dal ko haal hi main sampann hue paanch rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav ke kisi bhi matdaan centre kii mashin ke saath chhedchhad karne kaa opshan chunane ke liye ek hafte kaa samay bhi degaa
 At the same time, every political party that accepts the challenge will be given different opportunity to prove their claim of machine malfunctions
 aap ne diya tha 'haikathan' par jorchunaav ayog ke adhikari ke mutabik, supreme court ne ayog ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle vivipat vaale iviem se voting karaane kii taiyaari karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 In order to ensure compliance with this order, the Commission has already prepared to conduct elections in evms with vvpats in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh assembly elections to be held later this year
 darasal vivipat mashin se ek parchi nikalati he, jisase matadaata ko maaloom padataa he ki usne jis ummidavaar ke paksh main iviem kaa batan dabaaya, uskaa vot usee ko gaya
 Earlier, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Trinamool Congress had expressed concern over the rigging of evms during the all-party meeting
 AAP ne nirvachan ayog ke iviem ko hack kar dikhaane kii chunauti ko swikaarne kaa swaagat kiya he, lekin 'haikathan' par jor diya
 The party said that if given a chance, it will prove that machines can be hacked

 In Ghar Najju Khan area of rampur, we meet 60-year-old Mazhar Mian, who has been doing zari work for the last 40 years
 wo kehete he, 'ye kaarobaar pehle hi kaaphi dabaav main he
 Goods are becoming expensive and the cost of work is not available, but after demonetisation, our work has stopped
 ' mazahar un kaarigaron main hai jinka maal muradabad auki dilli or phir desh ke kai hisson main jaataa he
 Sarees, Dupattas and Suits
 zari ke kaam ke nayab hunarmand ye kalakaar notebandi ke baad se pareshaan hai
 The wooden frames on which Mazhar used to work are lying there where the artisans used to work
 sirf teen log ek dupattey par kaam karte dikhe
 "there were 30 to 35 people a month and a half ago," says Mazhar
 aaj sab kaam chhodkar ja chuke hai kyonki mere paas unhen dene ke liye cash nahin he
 ' aakhir in kaarigaron ko cash kyon chaiye, aap inhen check se paisa kyon nahin dete? is sawaal ke jawaab main mazahar bataate hai ki unke kaarigaron ko 50 se 60 rupee pratidin miltaa he
 That is, if you work every day for the whole month, then you do not earn more than Rs 2000
 aise main logon ko khate kholane kii zarurat hi mahasoos nahin hui
 Life is going to be difficult due to the amount of money they earn
 unke saath kaam karne vaale 42 saal ke hashim kii jeb main ek nayaa paisa bhi nahin he
 He says, 'there is only a 500 rupee note in my pocket which Seth gave
 ' ye kehete huye hashim ek 500 kaa purana note nikaal kar dikhaate hai or kehete hai, 'is note kaa main kya karun? isse na baniyaa anaj detaa he or na hi koi ise lene ko taiyaar he
 When asked if you cannot use a debit card or mobile app
 vah kehete hai, 'bilkul bekaar chiz he hamaare liye, ham 50-60 rupee rose kamaane vaale aadmi credit card yaa kisi or card kaa kya karenge
 What will we do about something we do not know
 jab hamaara khaataa hi nahin khulaa to ham kya karenge (is suzav kaa)
 ' ‚Äúaap jitna maheene main kamaate hai utane main ghar nahin chal paata?‚Äù yah sunakar hashim kaa galaa bhar aata he
 It is said, 'I earn twenty-two hundred rupees a month from twenty-two
 ham paanch bhai hai or do bahanen hai
 a house is broken ab modi ji ko kya pataa he
 What he has decided he cannot change
 ab ghar main khaane ko ho yaa naa ho unhen kuch pataa nahin he
 We know how time is being spent, our heart knows
 ' Why is Seth Mazhar of Hashim giving old notes to his artisans
 vah apni majaburi jataata he kyonki bahut saare vyapaaree in chote kaarobaariyon ko puraane note hi thama rahe hai
 He says, "sir, we are getting the same note from above
 jahaan se ham maal kharid rahe hai vah kahata he ki yahi note lo nahin to kuch nahin milegaa
 All this is happening under compulsion
 'tippaniyan The 40-year-old Javed started driving a rickshaw due to lack of work, but he says that the ride in Rampur is less and the rickshaw has become more
 ab to rickshaw chalaanaa bhi kargar nahin rahaa
 All the people are running away from work
 rickshawvaalon ko sawari nahin mil rahi
 ' gher najju khan muhalle se kuch dur hamaari mulaakaat israar, samad or harish se hui
 All three have left Zari work
 35 saal ke israar ne kaha, 'gaanv se maal lekar main bazaar main bechata lekin cash na hone se jabardast maar padi he
 Do not know where to go now
 ab haath main haath rakhkar baithe hai
 ' mazahar jis jagah kaam karte hai vahaan lakdi ke wo frem suune pade hai jis par karigar kaam kiya karte the
 Only three people were seen working on a scarf
 mazahar kehete hai, 'dedh maheene pehle tak 30 se 35 log the
 Today everyone has left work because i do not have cash to give them
 ' After all, why do these artisans want cash, why don't you give them money by check? In response to this question, Mazhar says that his artisans get 50 to 60 rupees per day
 yani puure maheene har rose bhi kaam karen to 2000 rupee se adhik nahin kamaate hai
 In such a situation, people did not feel the need to open accounts
 jitna kamaate hai utane se zindagi badi mushkil se chal paa rahi he
 There is not even a new money in the pocket of Hashim, 42, who works with him
 vah kehete hai, 'meri jeb main sirf 500 rupee kaa note he jo seth ne diya tha
 While saying this, Hashim takes out an old 500 note and says, "what should i do with this note?" Neither the baniya gives it nor is anyone willing to take it
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya aap debit card yaa mobile ap istemaal nahin kar sakate
 He says, 'absolutely useless thing is for us, what we, a man earning 50-60 rupees a day, would do with a credit card or any other card
 jis chiz ko ham jaanate nahin ham uskaa kya karenge
 What will we do when our account is not open (of this suggestion)
 ' "can't walk home for as many months as you earn?" Hearing this, Hashim is strangled
 kehete hai, 'main baees se teis sau rupee maheene kamata hum
 We have five brothers and two sisters
 ek ghar he tutaa phuta
 Now what does Modi ji know unhone to apana faisla jo kar diya wo to badal nahin saktaa
 Now they do not know whether to eat at home or not
 kaise vakt kaat rahe hai ye ham jaanate hai hamaara dil jaanata he

 ' yah baat sach he ki pichley kareeb ek saal ke andar huin chayankartaaon kii baithak main ravi shastri nahin balki viraat kohli shaamil hote rahe
 Although the captains and coaches only have an opinion in these meetings, Shastri wanted a change
 aisi tamaam baaten coach ke chayan ke dauraan bhi huin
 5 parameters were decided for the selection of the coach, which Shastri won and won
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki duusare daavedaar utane majboot nahin the, isliye shastri ko iskaa phayda mila or unhen do saal ke liye bhartiya cricket team kaa coach chun liya gaya

 aise main rishabh pant ke alaava hamaare paas koi or vikalp nahin tha
 We knew their potential
 yahi kaaran he ki pant ke rup main ek baayen haath ke ballebaaj ko bulaayaa
 However, Shastri has been chosen as the head coach among all these but-and-buts
 shastri kaa nayaa kaarykaal tii-20 vishwa cap-2021 tak hoga
 He is currently on a tour of the Windies with the team and gave interviews to the CAC through a video conference
