 aaj nagarjun kii punyatithi he
 a week before Rajkamal publication, his biography 'yatra Yatri' has been published
 lekhak hai taranand viyogi
 Sahitya Aaj Tak is sharing an excerpt from the same book for its readers and fans of Baba
 is pustak ke bare main vachaspati, ko dashakon tak nagarjun ke kareeb rahe, adhyeta or sameekshak hai ne likhaa he ki baba nagarjun ko sansar se vidaa hue bees varsh se zyaada hue
 Meanwhile, the Tarun generation of hindi-maithili will also be able to fully interview Baba Nagarjuna with this work
 baba ke bare main ek jagah lekhak ne likhaa he, 'smriti, drushtaant or anubhav kaa zakhira tha unke paas
 'these three things are also present in this biography of Taranand
 baba ke jivan-srijan par yah bahut rachanaatmak, aitihaasik mahatva kaa kaary sampann ho sakaa he
 i would say this much that even i cannot write such an authentic biography of Baba
 'yugon kaa yatri' hindi kii kuch suprasiddh jivaniyon kii shrunkhlaa kii adhyatan shashakt kadi he
 Book excerpts: Traveler of the Yugas - Biography of Nagarjuna Three or four episodes of these days Nagarjuna used to narrate every now and then and others have also written about some episodes
 ek prasang 'aryaavart’ yaa 'mithila mihir’ main naukari ko lekar he
 The proposal came that you should work in daily or weekly papers
 donon hi patr maharaj darbhanga ke swaamitv ke the, jinase nagarjun kaa virodh jagazahir tha
 However, Maharaj was a merciful king
 apane kripapaatr brahmanon ko yun bhi bina kuch kiye-karaaye vah chaar aane kaa waseefa dete rahete the, jise mithila main 'channiyaan khoris’ kaha jaataa tha
 If he had taken a distinguished senior along with him to Maharaj and apologized for past mistakes, he could have got a job from so many
 lekin nagarjun duusari tarah se dekhte the
 He used to see that the Darbhanga King is the best among all the exploiting zamindars of the country, whose employees loot up to eighty percent of the produce on some pretext from the farmers
 kisaan aandolan ke daur main unhone yah bhi dekha tha ki 'aryaavart’ mukhar rup se zameendaaron kaa pakshdhar akhbaar tha
 And, 'mithila Mihir' was, in a way, the mouthpiece of Darbhanga Raj, which was read by Raj's tehsildars and staff
 aparajita ke hawaale se kaha jaay to nagarjun to aise the ki 'maharaj ne kai baar kavita padhane ke liye bulawaaya par ye kabhi gayi hi nahin
 'the job came home this way
 doosraa qissa pustika-prakaashan kaa he
 Nagarjuna used to call it ‘kitabiya’
 yani ki kavitaaon kii choti kitaab, aath pej, solah pej kii
 He received this rite from the mass movement
 kisaan aandolan ke dinon ke parache, yaa phir forward block ke dinon ke
 When poetry became serious, poetry replaced prose, the rest remained the same
 gadhy-padya to kavi ke shaashvat saathi hote hai
 Shekhar Joshi has written, Once in the fifties Nagarjuna went to meet him in a hostel-type camp, then Joshi ji's Punjabi companion called out from the door and said - 'oye Joshi, tera koi ghad-pada aaya hai
 ’ saamne nagarjun ko bhi sunate dekh joshi ji bhale ghabaraaye hon, nagarjun to muskura hi rahe honge
 This was the prose verse
 pehali kitbia kaa idia kaise aayaa tha? jab unhone 'aryaavart’ vagairah kii naukari nahin sweekaari to ghar ke logon kaa sahaj prashn tha- 'tab bachuva, tumhaara likhnaa-padhanaa parivaar ke kis kaam kaa?’ nagarjun bataate the-taav main hamane apni maithili kavitaaon kaa chota pamfalate chhapavaya or use railgadee main ga-gaakar bechney lage
 Chana sells like a hot one! Twelve arrows a day - used to bring one rupee
 pitaaji samajhen ki dam he ladke kii kavita main
 These were the days when Nagarjuna started Kavithai's second innings with great seriousness
 maano unhone tay kar liya tha ki unhen kavi hi bananaa he
 At the same time, he wrote the poem 'ravi Thakur', in which his determination and confidence can be seen
 apane ko vahaan unhone 'dabi hui doob kaa roopak’ bataaya
 The reference was to the deed-inferior-depressed Krishakputra
 vahaan unhone sarvasuvidha-sampann vishwakavi kii bhidant is dabi hui doob se kara di thi ki 'mujhako bhi mili he pratibha kii prasadi / mujhase bhi shobhit he prakruti kaa anchal
 'he asked Kaviguru to bless him,' Let my mind be stable ', that is, in Kavithai
 yah kavita ravi thakur ke nidhan par likhi gayi thi
 It is another matter that nobody paid attention to this poem in those days
 'mod’ ke april 1941 ank main unki 'kavik swapn’ kavita chhapi
 This poem was even further from the 'last prostration'
 vanchiton ke prati prem or nyaay kii bhaavana ko vahaan itani gahari sanvedyata ke saath pesh kiya gaya tha ki vajrahruday ko bhi thaharkar vichaar karne ko vivash karata tha
 The special feature was that inside it a part was threaded
 kavita kaa antarlay kathatmakataa se guntha tha or sampreshniyata itani ki sidhe shrotaaon ke dil tak pahunchati thi
 He then wrote the poems ‘budh Var’ and ‘lament’
 inamen kshat-vikshat manushyata, jisamen mathrubhumi bhi baraabar kii saajheedaar thi, kii pidaa itani maarmikata ke saath vyakt kii gayi thi ki kiran ji ne likhaa he-yah likhanewaale kavi kaa hriday ek bhikshu sanyasi kaa hriday nahin ho saktaa
 He was truly transformed
 nagarjun tarauni se kaashi gayi
 There he told Kiran ji that his book could be solved along with Kavithai as well as the matter of livelihood
 sabane milakar 'boodh var’ or 'vilaap’ kii alag-alag pustikas hazaar pratiyon main chapaayin
 Those were the days of the saurath-sabha
 sabha main to uskaa 'chhuhukka ud gaya’ yani ki bahut bikri hui
 One and a half hundred or two copies were sold by Chandranath Mishra Amar singly, Amar Ji has written
 nagarjun bataate the-pehle din bechakar laute, paise pita ke haath par rakh diye
 The father wanted to prove us incompetent, so he got pampered after getting money
 thudi chhukar kaha- bete, pita par gussa nahin karte
 i can remember this and this moment when i have loved my father! He used to sing these poems in a special rhythm
 kavita kii ye dhune un dinon samooche ilaake main prasiddh ho gayi thim
 Shobhakant has written, after many years, he had heard someone in Pethia sing the poems of the traveler in the same rhythm that would have passed from the Shruti-tradition of generations to that man
 aaj to ve kavitaayen theatre ke kalakaaron kii bhi pasandida hai
 These poems of the traveler were conspicuously against the Brahminical-male-socialist system, even though it was widely welcomed, it was special
 ve bahut maarmik thim
 If he wanted, he could continue to take out more such booklets which would also be right for his economic earnings
 lekin do kaaran hue ki tatkaal unhone is bare main nahin sochaa
 Firstly, Aparajita did not like his work
 vah ise arthoparjan kaa adham upaay maanati thim
 In Nagarjuna's words - he used to know these works of song-chewing-surfacing paglets
 are koi mardon vaala kaam karen! yah kya he, rajani-sajani

 somvaar kaa vrath shravan, caitra, vaisaakh, karthik or magh maheene ke shukla paksh ke pehle somvaar se shuru kiya jaataa he
 It is said that by observing this fast till 16 Monday, all wishes are fulfilled
 yahaan jaane solah somvaar kii vrath katha or kya he isaki puja vidhi
 
 
 Solah Somvar Vrat Katha: Once upon a time, Lord Shiva, along with Parvati ji, came to Amravati city on earth, where the king built a temple of Shiva
 shankar ji vahiin thahar gaye
 One day Parvati ji spoke to Shivji - Nath! Let's play Chaucer today
 khel shuru hua, usee samay pujari puja karne ko aae
 Parvati ji asked- priest! Who will win? He spoke of Shankar Ji, but Parvati ji won in the end
 parvati ne juthi bhavishyavaanee ke kaaran pujari ji ko kodhi hone kaa shraap de diya, or vah kodhi ho gaye
 After some time the nymphs from heaven came to worship in the same temple and seeing the priest asked them the reason for leprosy
 shiv aarti karegi dukhon kaa nivaranunke prashnon kaa uttar dete hue pujari ji ne sari baat bataai
 Then the Apsaras told him about Solhasomvara's fast and asked Mahadev to pray for his suffering
 pujari ji ne utsukata se vrath kii vidhi poochi
 Apsara said- Fast on Monday without taking food and water, and after worshiping in the evening, make a half-hearted wheat flour churma and three clay idols and Baba Bhole with sandalwood, rice, ghee, jaggery, lamp, belpatra etc
 Worship baad main chuurma bhagwaan shankar ko chadhayen or phir is prasad ko 3 hisson main baantkar ek hissaa logon main baante, doosraa gaae ko khilaaen or teesraa hissaa swayan khaakar pani pien
 Do sixteen Mondays by this method and on the seventeenth Monday make five churma baati made of wheat flour and distribute it with bhog
 phir parivaar ke saath prasad grahan karen
 By doing this, Shiva will complete your desire
 yah kahkar apsara swarg ko chali gayi
 Get immense praise of Lord Shiva with this praise and started worshiping as fast as possible and got rid of the disease
 kuch din baad shiv-parvati dobaaraa us mandir main aae
 Seeing the priest properly, Parvati asked him the reason for getting rid of the disease
 tab pujari ne unase solah somvaar kii mahima kaa varnan kiya
 After which Mata Parvati also observed this fast and as a result, Karthikeya became disobedient to the mother
 is par kartikeya ji ne bhima gaurise poocha ki kya kaaran he ki meraa man aapke charnon main laga? jis par unhone apane vrath ke bare main batalaaya
 Then Gauriputra also fasted, as a result of which he got his estranged friend
 mitra ne bhi achaanak milane kaa kaaran poocha or fari vrath kii vidhi jaanakar usne bhi vivaah kii ichha se solah somvaar kaa vrath kiya
 As a result of the fast, he went abroad, there was the king's daughter's swayamvara
 us raja kaa pran tha ki hathini jisko maala pahanayegi usee ke saath putree kaa vivaah hoga
 That Brahmin also sat on one side with the desire to see the swayamvara
 hathini ne maala us brahman kumaar ko pahanaai
 Married with pomp, then both started living happily
 vrath kii vidhi puri na karne par rani hui abhaagiek din rajakanya ne poocha- nath! aapane koun sa punya kiya jisase rajkumaron ko chhod hathini ne aapkaa varan kiya
 The Brahmin duly declared the sixteen Monday fast
 raaj-kanya ne putr prapti ke liye vrath kiya or sarvagun sampann putr praapt kiya
 On growing up, the son asked- Mother! By what virtue did you receive me? Rajakanya also told his son about this fast of Shiva
 tab uske putr ne rajya kii kaamana se solah somvaar vrath kiya
 Then the king's messengers came and selected him for the kingdom
 iske uskaa vivaah sampann hua or raja ke divangat hone par brahman kumaar ko gaddi mili
 Then he kept doing this fast
 ek din us raja ne apni patni se pujan saamagree shivalay main le chalane ko kaha, parantu usne daasiyon dwaara bhijwa di
 When the king finished the puja, there was a voice from Akashvani that he should expel his wife, otherwise she will destroy you
 prabhu kii ajna maan usne rani ko nikaal diya
 The queen went to an old lady in the city cursing fate
 deen dekhakar budhiya ne iske sir par soot kii potli rakh bazaar bheja, raste main aandhi ai, potli ud gai
 The old lady reprimanded her
 vahaan se vah rani taili ke yahaan pahunchi to sab bartan chatak gaye, usne bhi nikaal diya
 When the water reached the river, the river dried up
 sarovar pahunchi to haath kaa sparsh hote hi jal main keede pad gaye, usne usee jal ko piyaa
 The tree under which it goes to rest would dry up
 van or sarovar kii yah dasha dekhakar gwaal ise mandir ke gusaai ke paas le gaye
 He understood the whole saga, this aristocratic abala is objectionable
 tab vah dhairya bandhaate hue bole- beti! tu mere yahaan rah, kisi baat kii chintaa mat kar
 The queen started living in the ashram, but insects would fall into whatever she had her hands on
 dukhi ho gusaain ji ne poocha- beti! kis dev ke aparaadh se teri yah dasha hui? rani ne bataaya – maine pati ajna kaa ulanghan kiya or mahadev ji ke pujan main nahin gai
 Samadhatab Gusain ji came out of the fast of 16 Monday and prayed to Shiva and said - Daughter! You fast for sixteen Mondays
 rani ne vidhivat solah somvaar vrath purna kiya
 With this effect, the king remembered the queen and sent messengers to search for her
 ashram main rani ko dekhakar duuton ne rani kaa pataa bataaya
 Then the king went and said to Gusain ji - Maharaj! This is my wife, i had abandoned it because of Shiva's displeasure
 ab bhagwaan shankar kii krupa se hi ise lene aayaa hum
 You allow it to go
 gusaain ji kii ajna se raja-rani nagar main aae
 The people decorated the whole city to welcome him, the instruments started playing, singing the songs of Mars
 isi ke saath raja shivaji kii krupa se har varsh solah somvaar vrath ko kar rani ke saath anand se rahane laga or ant main shivlok ko praapt hue
 Similarly, a person who devotional fasts sixteen Mondays and hears the story has all his wishes fulfilled and finally he attains Shivaloka
 aamtaur par mana jaataa he ki purush zyaadaatar samay sex ke bare main sochate hai or mahilaayein shopping ke bare main
 It is also believed about women that they are fond of shopping, traveling and watching TV more than sex, but this is not true
 mahilaon main sex ke prati deewangi purushon se zyada hoti he
 Sex is as important during stimulation as eating at the time of hunger
 heere, sone aadi ke aabhushanon ke prati bhi mahilaon main khub aakarshan hota he, lekin jaan len ki mahilaon main duniya kii kisi bhi beshkeemtee cheez se zyada sex kii chahat hoti he
 Some women may not express their wishes in front of their husbands or boy friends in shame, but their partners should always take care of their wishes
 patni yaa garlfriend se vyavhaar aisa rakhen ki wo kisi bhi tarah kii baat karne se dar yaa jhijak mahasoos na karen
 Advance the relationship in such a way that they can take initiative in the matter of sex too
 iske saath hi dhyaan rakhen ki offis kii tension ghar lekar na jaaen or un par hameshaa haaavee hone kii koshish naa karen
 Sometimes due to the large age difference between the two, they are not able to talk openly, so always keep friendly behavior with them and take care of their likes and dislikes
 shaq kisi bhi rishte ke liye sabase khatarnaak cheez hoti he, isliye kabhi apni partner par shaq naa karen or khud bhi unhen dhokhaa na den
 Also, if you feel that your partner is cheating on you, then instead of fighting, try to find the real reason for it
 sex ke prati behad chahat hone ke baavjood mahilaayein aamtaur par apni ichha jaahir nahin karatin, lekin aapako apane partner kii is aadat ko samajhnaa hoga or uskaa sammaan karnaa chahie

 And it is enough to say that Rahane's dream of playing the World Cup will remain just a dream
 KL Rahul should be out; Manish Pandey in ; Rahane as back up and why is Umesh yadav our
 Poor from selectors Umesh Yadav was the number three bowler in terms of wickets in the World Cup in Australia in 2015

 july se aap esemes bhejkar train kaa tikat book kar sakenge
 Keeping an eye on the growing mobile phone market in India, IRCTC will start sms-based rail ticket booking from July 1 and a number dedicated to it will be announced soon
 iarsitisi ke ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki mobile aadhaarit booking ke tahat kahin se bhi or kisi bhi samay tikat book karne kii aasaan suvidha pradaan kii jaaegi
 There will be no need for any printout, as the ticketing message will be considered valid during the journey
 tippaniyan Under this, people have to register their mobile number in IRCTC as well as their bank
 bank dhanrashi ke bhugtan praadhikrut karne ke liye mmidi (mobile mani aaidentifire) or otipi (van time password) jari karegaa
 The official said that SMS booking is very easy, as a passenger only has to type the passenger details like train number, destination, travel date, class and name, age, and gender in his SMS box
 unhone bataaya ki use tranjaction idi milegaa or uske baad vah ek duusare esemes se bhugtan karegaa
 a senior IRCTC official said that mobile based booking will provide easy facility to book tickets from anywhere and at any time
 iske liye kisi printout kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin hogi, kyonki tikating sandesh ko safar ke dauraan vaid mana jayega
 The comments iske tahat logon ko apana mobile number iarsitisi or saath hi apane bank main register karana hoga
 The bank will issue MMID (mobile Money Identifier) and OTP (one Time Password) to authorize payment of funds

 agar aap cricket prashansak hai, khaskar test maichon ke, to aapane in dinon ke mukaable puure saal shaayad hi kuch behatar mahasoos kiya ho
 At least this is what is happening to me
 thik he ki kanpakampane vaali thand main subah paanch baje jaagnaa kisi yatnaa se kam nahin, lekin bhartiya cricket team or australia ke bich safed kapadon vaale shastreey cricket ke romaanch ko dekhne kii anubhuti bhi kam aanandadaayak nahin
 The special thing is that in the live telecast of the Test match in Australia, you may be supporting a team, it may be that your team is getting beaten, your star players are flopping, but still in front of the TV screen Does not heart to remove eyes from kya vaaki yah cricket kaa hi romaanch he
 
 
 The Probably yes, but apart from the thrill of cricket, Ambience also has its own charm in the Test matches being played in Australia
 australian prasarakon kaa tivi kawarej bhi kamaal kaa he
 Amidst all this, a strong panel of cricket experts also keeps you hooked
 brisben test ke dauraan shen worne jis taazgi or urja ke saath najar aae or jis sateekta se unhone match kaa vishleshan kiya, uski duusari misaal talashna mushkil chunauti he
 Harsha Bhogle, who was in the top list of Indian cricket commentator and anchor, appeared average in front of him
 din ke khel ke brake main aap demien martin kii sahajata bhi dekhie or unka vishleshan bhi
 Cricketer-experts like Sanjay Manjrekar also seem pale in front of him
 tivi kawarej ke maamle main to australian broadcaster vaise bhi behtareen maane jate hai
 Hardly during the matches in any other country you have such shots, which are panned and show the entire stadium in one frame and then bring it directly from there to the pitch
 takanic or visheshgyon kaa panel cricket khilne ko romaanch ko badaye yaa na badaye, dekhne ke romaanch ko to badha hi detaa he
 All these together create such a charm that your eyes just stick to the TV screen
 australian maidan bhi itane khubasurat najar aate hai, ki hari-hari ghaas ankhon ko raahat detii mahasoos hoti hai
 Along with all this you also have to praise Australian cricket fans
 ekadam bindaas or ekadam kool
 You hardly see such an attitude in the Indian stand
 lekin sochiega ki kya ye sab milakar khel kii khubsuurati ko badha nahin dete
 After seeing all this you can take a break, because after that you can enjoy the thrill of Test cricket between South Africa and West Indies at South African ground
 satellite tivi ke jamaane main ek phayda to yah he hi ki duniya ke kisi bhi kone main cricket ho, aap ghar baithe live cricket ke romaanch kaa anand le sakate hai
 Cricket matches in South Africa are also very similar to the ambience of Australian cricket
 haalanki west indies kii cricket team kaaphi kamjor ho chuki he or dakshin africa cricketron ne pehle test main joardaar pradarshan dikhaaya he
 But the thrill of the ball and bat is visible
 samay ke saath test cricket main kaaphi badlaav hue hai, ballebaajon ke badhate dabadabe main cricket kaa romaanch bhi gata he
 Despite this, it is always a pleasure to watch cricket matches, especially Test matches at Australia and South African grounds
 subah saadhe paanch baje se raat ke 10 baje tak, vah bhi kanpakanpati thand main lagaataar cricket aapako bor to bilkul nahin karata

 Insurance Is The Subject Matter Of Agdam Bagdam
 
 
 har beemaa vigyaapan ke aakhir main ye kanoonee chetavanee aise padhi jaati he jaise sadak dughartna se batch bhi gaye, to is chetavanee se nahin batch paaenge
 Insurance is a complex subject not just for the general public but also for news anchors
 bharat main beemaa companiyon kaa itihaas ab se chaar saal baad 2018 main 200 saal puraa karne ja rahaa he
 We can aim for India with 100 percent insurance in 2018
 ye idia deshhit main desh ko de rahaa hum
 Maybe there is no need after Jan Dhan
 to 196 saal pehle 1818 main bharat main beemaa vyapaar kaa aagaman hota he
 When the Orient Life Insurance Company is established in Kolkata and fails by 1834
 1870 main british insurance act banataa he
 In the last three decades of the 19th century, three insurance companies exist in the Bombay Residency
 bombai mutual oriental or empire of india
 At that time only foreign insurance companies used to do business in India
 jaise albert life astaurance, royal insurance livelpur or landan globe insurance
 Many laws are made during this time, but the Insurance Act of 1938 comes into existence as the foundation of insurance laws in India
 1950 main beemaa vyavsaay kaa rashtriyakaran kar liya jaataa he
 The sector starts to globalize after nationalized in the 1990s
 ye aitihaasik jaankaree maine beemaa companiyon kii niamak sanstha aiardie kii site se lee he
 Which is in both Hindi and English, but the history is only in English
 aiardie kii site ke anusaar bharat main is vakt 28 general insurance companiyaan hai
 There are also Agricultural Insurance Commission of India, 24 life insurance companies
 bharat main beemaa sector ke 65 fisadi hisse par elisi kaa kabja he
 How LIC remains in this market and remains such a reliable company, these insurance sector professors will know
 kahin isliye to nahin ki beemaa dharak elisi ko zyada surakshit samajhate hai
 irda's site has shown that the sector is growing at a speed of 15–20 percent
 kya ye raftaar kam he yaa koi aisa bhi sector he jo isse zyada raftaar se bad rahaa he
 The insurance sector contributes 7 percent to India's GDP
 kaha ja rahaa he ki beemaa sector main 80 se ek lakh karod rupee tak kaa nivesh aa saktaa he or naukariyaan bhi khub badhengi
 It is now being argued that if competition increases in insurance companies, the premium will be reduced and more and more people will be able to take benefits
 abhi bhi compatishan to hoga hi he to kya isse aapane premium kam hote dekha he
 The Insurance Law Amendment Bill has been circling this committee since 2008
 centre sarkaar jo bill lekar ai he uske anusaar, bhartiya companiyaan kaarobaar ke liye zyada videshi nivesh chaahati hai
 Many life insurance companies are only 7–8 years old
 nai hone kii vajah se kamai nahin kar saki hai
 Their demand is for more foreign investment, so that they can profit by increasing business
 videshi companiyaan general insurance ke sector main bhi utarana chaahati hai jiske aadhe se zyada par is vakt general insurance kaa kabja he
 After the passage of this bill, domestic insurance companies will also be able to raise capital from the market
 swasthya beemaa ko ek alag sector ke rup main viksit kiya gaya he
 Everyone has opposed this bill
 bijepi vipaksh main rahete hue kar chuki he or congress vipaksh main aane ke baad kar rahi he
 The left is permanently opposed
 bijepi ke bheetar aresas kaa bhartiya majdoor sangh bhi virodh kar diya he
 But the Indian labor union does not have much influence to turn the Modi government against this bill
 2011 kii standing cameti kii report main ol india insurance imply asoshiyeshan ne kaha tha ki agar share bazaar ke zariye bhartiya beemaa companiyaan puunji jutaayengi to videshi niveshkon ko pichley darvaaze se ghusane kaa mauka mil jayega
 The All India LIC Employees Federation had said that the argument was given by the Latin American governments that with the coming of foreign investment, the management of insurance companies will be better, productivity will increase and they will be equipped with new technology but nothing like this happened
 yah sab karne ke liye epadiai hi zaruri nahin he
 Life Insurance Corporation of India meets these standards at its level
 daavon ke niptaan main elisi duniya main behatar maani jaati he
 The National Federation of Insurance Field Workers of India had said that many insurance companies were ruined during the global recession
 28 november ko sansad kii salect cameti ko report deni thi, lekin cameti ke adhyaksh bijepi saansad chandan mitra ne 12 disambar tak kaa samay maanga he
 While presenting this proposal, a member of the committee CPM p Rajeev said that the members of the committee did not know that the date was going to increase

 bharat bhushan ne aktubar, 2011 main jab sabhi bhartiya airlinon ke vittiya maamalon kii nigaraanee kaa aadesh diya to airline operataron ko saanp soongh gaya
 Given Bhushan's clean record, airlines knew that it would be difficult for them to hide the true picture of their financial situation
 dijisie ne paaya ki zyaadaatar airline mitvyayita ke liye jin upayon kaa paalan kar rahi hai, usase suraksha or rakrakhaav ke maanak khatre main pad gaye hai
 Bhushan does not hesitate to take tough steps
 unhone 27 july, 2011 ko mumbai main mahalakshmi helipad ko band kar diya jahaan ambani, poonawala, ruia or hiranandani ke helicopter khadey rahete the
 The helipad remained closed for three months as an audit found safety standards were not followed there
 bhushan kehete hai, 'yah kadam un logon kii suraksha ke liye uthaaya gaya tha
 The DGCA chief had ordered a security audit of all helipads across the country
 isaki vajah yah thi ki arunachal pradesh ke tawang main 19 april, 2011 ko pawan hans kaa ek helicopter durghatnagrast ho gaya tha jisamen savaar 18 log maare gaye the
 After the order to conduct a security audit, Bhushan's image was established as an officer not tolerating negligence

 Bhushan also found widespread nepotism in the DGCA in which nine senior officials, including the Joint Director General, helped to co-pilot their children and land them in various airlines without the necessary government approval
 bhushan ne naagarik uddyan mantralay ko agast, 2011 main report bhejkar aath adhikariyon par baari jurmaana lagane kii sifarish kii thi
 Bhushan believes that action against officials is necessary to send a strong message

 Bhushan says that when the aviation sector is growing day by day, it becomes a challenge for the head of the organization

 Arguably, RCEP was not a hard bargain from the WTO under which India has opened up its market to the entire world
 aarasieepi main shaamil har arthvyavastha ko china se utana hi dar lag rahaa he jitna ki dablutio main europe or america se vikasshil deshon ko tha
 India could have prevented the dominance of China by leading small Asian economies, but after the alleged world-winning diplomatic campaigns of the last six years, we handed over the flourishing market in the neighborhood to China

 Weakness in the RCEP will weaken India's favor in the FTA negotiations with the European Community and Canada

 Supporters have demanded that Arvind Limbavali be made a minister
 saath hi unhone chetavanee bhi di he
 Supporters have said that if he is not made a minister, he will resign along with the mlas of his community
 karnataka main bijepi ne bhale hi sarkaar bana lee he lekin karnataka kaa sankat kam nahin hua he

 arvind limbavali ne bhale hi is maamle main ab tak koi tippanee na kii ho lekin bijepi ke andar hi mantrimandal main shaamil na kiye jane se kai vidhayakon main naaraazgi he
 Internal discord of the BJP is also coming to the fore

 On Tuesday, 17 legislators took oath as cabinet ministers
 vahiin mantri nahin banaae jane se party ke kuch netaa naaraaz hai
 Karnataka BJP veteran Umesh Katti also did not find a place in the cabinet, which surprised people

 kapil sharma teesri baar darshakon ke saamne kamedi sho lekar aae hai
 He did not get the popularity he had in the second time
 akhirkaar, kuch hi episod ke baad nirmaataaon ko sho band karnaa padaa
 Now that he has once again returned without Sunil Grover, it was natural to doubt his success, but the way the initial episodes of Kapil's show entertained the audience, it is clear that it can be quite entertaining in the future
 is
 philhal kapil kaa sho, tiarapy ke maamle main duusare number par jagah bana lee he
 Initially it seemed that Kapil would regain his lost status on TV
 kya darshak sho se anterten honge? iskaa jawaab dikh rahaa he
 The five episodes of Kapil Sharma have laughed the audience
 kiku sharada ho yaa chandan prabhakar, krishna abhishek yaa phir sumon chakravarti, sabhi ke panches or jokes is baar joardaar najar aa rahe hai
 Kapil's timing is getting better show by show
 pehle hi sho main ranvir singh, sara ali khan khan ne kamedi kaa tadakaa gaya
 After this, the episode of Salman Khan and his family was said to be the most entertaining episode of Kapil's show

 com / gvbldpyepe — Sony TV (@sonytv) January 13, 2019 Kapil's initial success is also significant in the sense that his show, which began with his old partner Sunil Grover, was almost rejected by the audience
 ab dekhnaa he ki kapil kis tarah apni is safalataa ko banaae rakh pate hai
 If Kapil does not repeat his old habits, then his show is sure to be televised
 bataa den ki unke sho ke band hone kaa kaaran unka gaiyr jimmedaarana ravaiya rahaa he
 Hopefully, Kapil will not do all this time

 Recently Vivian desena, the mail lead of the serial, announced to leave the serial

 There is talk that after Vivian, now female lead Rubina Dilac may also leave the serial

 This is the reason why he has said goodbye to the serial

 loksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh main sapa or bispi ke bich siton kaa jis tarah se bantwaaraa hua he usko dekhakar aisa lag rahaa he ki bispi supremeo mayawati ne siton ke bantwaare main sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav se baaji maar lee he
 Perhaps the most senior SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav has realized this situation
 yahi vajah he ki vah tikaton kii baantne kii baat kah rahe hai
 In fact, many seats have come to the account of SP where its performance has been very poor
 sabase pehle baat karte hai uttar pradesh kii kanpur seat kii to yahaan par bijepi ke varisht netaa murali manohar joshi saansad hai
 Joshi received 474712 votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha
 duusare number par congress ko 251766 vot, bispi ko 53218 or sapa ko sabase kam 25723 vot mili the
 Now even if both the parties combine the votes, they are not staying against the BJP
 donon hi partiyaan abhi tak is seat par kabhi chunaav nahin jeet pai hai
 Similarly, Varanasi has become the most difficult seat in the sp's part
 jahaan par saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main piem modi yahaan par record voton se jite the
 He received 581022 votes
 aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal yahaan par duusare number rahe unako 209238 mili the
 The Congress was in third place and got 75614 votes
 jabaki bispi (60579) or samaajawaadee party (45,291) kramash: chauthe or paanchave number thi
 Both the parties have never won this seat
 bijepi ke garh lakhanu jahaan se kendriya mantri rajnath singh saansad hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections SP was number five here and BSP was number four
 is seat par na to sapa or na hi bispi ne kabhi jeet darj kar pai hai
 Talk about the Ghaziabad seat of western Uttar Pradesh, where Union Minister VK Singh is an MP
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main sapa yahaan par paanchave number par or bispi chauthe number par thi
 Talk about Hardoi parliamentary seat, here Anshul Verma MP from BJP
 bahujan samaaj party yahaan par duusare number thi jabaki sapa tisare number par thi
 This seat has also gone to the account of SP itself
 haalanki donon hi partiyon ko mili voton ko jod den to bijepi yahaan kaaphi peeche ho jaati he
 Similarly, Priyanka Singh Rawat of BJP is the MP from Barabanki seat, Congress was second in the year 2014 elections
 jabaki bispi chauthe or samaajawaadee party paanchaven number thi
 Even if the votes of both the parties are merged, she will be far behind the BJP
 banda seat par bhi bijepi kaa kabja he lekin pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bispi yahaan par duusare number thi or sapa tisare number par donon hi partiyon ke voton ko mila den to bijepi se aage jate dikhaai de rahi hai
 In the wake of the Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha elections to be held in December, Congress President Arul Shahul Gandhi pledged his resolution in Sikar on the last day of his two-day visit to the state
 sikar rajasthan kejatbahul shekhavati kshetra kaa hissaa he
 Vasundhara Raje has brought the Gaurav Yatra here before Rahul
 piem modi or amit shah kii raily bhi yahaan hui hai
 Questions are arising as to whether the political equation of Shekhawati will change after the visit of these veterans? Sometime Congress stronghold, now BJP occupied Shekhawati is the western part of Rajasthan which includes Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Churu district
 jat bahul shekhavati kshetra kabhi congress kaa majboot durg rahaa lekin 2013 kevidhansabha chunaavamein bijepi is kshetra main send lagane main kaamyaab rahi
 Out of 8 seats of Sikar, BJP is in possession, Congress is on 2 seats, while an independent MLA Nand Kishore Maharia has joined Congress
 jhunjhunu kii 7 siton main se bijepi ke paas do siten hai, do par congress, 2 par nirdaleey or 1 par bispi kaa kabja he
 On the other hand, 4 out of 6 seats in Churu district, BJP 1 is occupied by Congress and 1 on BSP
 modi, shah or raaje teenon kaa khaas focusasaaf he ki 21 siton vaale shekhavati kshetra main congress ke paas mahaj 6 siten hai
 The Congress is throwing all its might to regain its territory
 vahiin bijepi bhi congress se hathiyaan hui jameen par kabja barkaraar rakhana chaahati he
 This is the reason why Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje celebrated the fourth anniversary of her government in Jhunjhunu
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne rashtriya poshan mishan ke launch or beti bachaao, beti padhaao ke vistaar ke kaarykram ke liye jhunjhunu ko chunaa
 BJP president Amit Shah has also rallied with ex-servicemen in Sikar
 jabaki mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje rajasthan gaurav yatra ke dauraan shekhavati kaa daura kar chuki hai
 The resentment of farmers was one of the main centers of the peasant movement in Rajasthan
 shekhavati ke kuch hisson main acha prabhaav rakhane vaale vam dal sipiem kii kisaan wing akhil bhartiya kisaan sabha (AIKS) kii aguwai main pichley sitambar yahaan bada kisaan andolan hua tha
 Farmers from all over the state supported this movement and the Raje government was forced to do a partial debt waiver
 lekin kisaanon kii naaraazgi abhi barkaraar he kyonki sardiyon ke mausam main ole se barbaad hui fasalon kaa uchit muaavja nahin mila or jo mila wo unke ghaav par namak chhidakane jaisaa tha
 The exercise to bring back the lost prestige of the Congress The leaders of the Congress were camping in Sikar for the last three days to make Rahul Gandhi's rally successful to regain the lost prestige in his stronghold
 jat bahul shekhavati main jaaton ke alaava kareeb 18 pratishat anusuchit jati ke log hai
 At the same time, the BJP lacks an influential Jat leader here, who either died or joined the Congress
 aise main is kshetra main satta virdohi lahar ko bhunaane ke liye congress puri koshish main he
 The Congress position in Shekhawati has been strengthened by Subhash Mahria, who was a Union Minister in the BJP government
 unke chote bhai va fatehpur se vidhayak nandakishor mahariya ne bhi congress kaa daaman tham liya
 The family of former Union Minister Shisharam Ola in Jhunjhunu is the strength of the Congress
 in sabake bich khinvsar se vidhayak jat netaa hanuman beniwal bhi is kshetra main najar banaae hue hai
 Major issues of Shekhawati Total debt waiver is the biggest issue in the Shekhawati region, as it is an agriculture dependent region
 shekhavati ke kisaanon ke 2 bade andolan ke baad hi sarkaar ne 50 hazaar rupee tak ke karj kii maafee kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Not getting the benefit of Kumbharam Canal Scheme is also a major issue here
 nimkathana, udaipurvati, shri madhopur, dataramgarh or rajgad ke sidhmukh main pani kii samasya bada mudda he jiskaa vaada sarkaar ne puraa nahin kiya
 Medical college is also a big issue in Sikar
 dhod, shrimadhopur, lakshmanagarh, pilaani va sujangadh main sarkari college nahin he
 Malala Yousafzai, a teenager who has been the victim of a Taliban attack on advocating education among girls, has been selected for this year's prestigious Global Leadership Award
 ghoshnaa ke anusaar ladakiyon ko shikshit karne or adhikarasampann banane main 15 varshiya malala kii bhoomika ko dekhte hue unhen is sammaan ke liye chunaa gaya he
 Malala was targeted for advocating for female education and for making outspoken remarks

 Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti slammed the officials from the stage during a program on Hindi
 uma ne dilli sarkaar ke saath milakar namaami gange yojana ke antargat yamuna ke punaruddhar par kaarykram kaa udghaatan kiya
 There was a problem in presenting the plan in English, on this occasion, the Union Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti took the stage at Chhat Ghat, ITO, Delhi
 kareeb saadhe aath sau karod rupye kii yojana kaa elaan karte hue mantri jab detail bataane lageen, to adhikariyon kii angreji main likhi yojana padhane main samay laga
 At first he said that the problem with me is that i can either read and speak at a time
 donon kaam baaki mantriyon kii tarah ek saath mujhase nahin hote
 She explained to the officials in front of the media during this while she kept quiet for some time and then turned to the mission director of Namami Gange sitting on the stage, Rajat Bhargava, saying that i have told these officials many times that the work should be in Hindi but these are Don't listen aaj tak band kamare main kaha he or aaj media ke saamne kah rahi hum ki agali baar se mujhe jaankaree hindi main chahie
 You guys use English but give me in Hindi
 sthaneey bhashaa kaa ho prayogkhan to kaarykram yamuna or ganga kii safai par chal rahaa tha or kahaan baat hindi angreji ke akhaade main pahunch gai
 However, when officers started looking at the face of Uma Bharti, Uma Bharti asked to lighten the atmosphere that Bangla in Bengal, Tamil in Tamil Nadu, Kannada in Karnataka should be brother
 aisa nahin ki har jagah hindi ho lekin jahaan kii jo sthaneey bhashaa he, uskaa prayog hona chahie
 Lage Hathuma Bharati also gave the example of Japan and Israelis who had brought interpreters with them in previous meetings but did not use English

 However, on this, Maulan definitely said that he can take up the responsibility of raising and writing a needy child
 lekin bachche ke baap kaa naam nahin badla ja saktaa he
 On another issue, the board said that if a woman's husband dies and they have enough resources, she can bear her own expenses
 agar aisa nahin he to phir uske maayke waalon kii jimmedaari hoti he
 The board also said that we will not accept Islam in the manner of any other religion
