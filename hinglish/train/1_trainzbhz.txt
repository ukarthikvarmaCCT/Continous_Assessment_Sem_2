 However, it will not be easy for India to overcome the experienced South African batsmen like Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Hamish Amla and Graeme Smith who have scored heavily here

 rashtriya raajnneeti main shah kaa udai kisi chamatkaar se kam nahin he

" 'sambhaal chuke hai 12 mantralayasaal 1989 se ab tak amit shah 29 chunaav lard chuke hai (sthaneey nikaayon ko lekar) or unhen kisi main bhi haar nahin mili he
 He became MLA in Gujarat four times in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2007
 vah gujarat kii modi sarkaar main bhi unke sabase vishwast sahyogi the
 At one time, he had 12 ministries - Home, Justice, Jail, Border Security, Civil Defense, Excise, Transport, Prohibition, Home Guards, Village Guard Party, Police Housing and Legislative Affairs Minister

 B

 beatech hote hi sabase pehla sawaal jo man main aata he wo he ab kya kiya jaae? us par agar campus placement na ho to lagane lagata he ki puri padhai bekaar ho gai or ab kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Confusion increases between jobs, higher studies and business
 lekin kisi nattejey par pahunchane se pehle in teen baton par dhyaan den:(1)naukari mil rahi ho to use bekaar na jane den
 Do not walk like others but listen to your conscience
 (2)aapaki tarah lakhon log entrens exam kii taiyaari main lage hai
 Your friends may be doing it too, but if you feel that you have the ability to pass the exam then believe 'YOU CAN (you can)
 (3)jaisaa aap karnaa chaahate hai vaisaa karen
 Who said that a good job will get a better job and satisfaction from a better job only
 gandhiji, apije abdul kalam, essi bose ne agar sirf padhai ko hi mukhya makasad maan liya hota to aaj duniya bade badlaav paane se chook jaati
 So move forward with confidence about the purpose of life
 campus placement:campus placemen main aane vaali badi companiyon ke intervyuu ko kwalifai karen or naukari paaen
 During this time you get plenty of time to think about what to do next
 management yaa koi or kshetra jisamen aapaki ruchi ho
 Do mtech: - You have studied engineering
 to ab emtek kiya ja saktaa he
 For this, you should prepare for the entrance with hard work
 GATE exam ko paas karen or iaiti or enaiti jaise behtareen sansthaanon main admician len
 Do an MBA: Do not think that you know only about technology, but try to make yourself feel that you are the business manager of a multinational company
 iske liye aapako emb karnaa padegaa to kiijie
 Yes, remember, in the meantime it should never come to mind that the country is flooded with MBA graduates and this will reduce job opportunities
 bas man main vishwaas rakhen ki aapako isi field main kuch karke dikhaanaa he
 If you are determined, then try to get admission in MBA college
 iske liye CAT exam paas karen or behatar college main admician len
 Civil Services: Who does not dream of becoming an IAS or IPS officer
 lekin itnaa to aap bhi jaanate hi honge ki civil services kii pariksha paas karnaa kitna kathin hota he
 But it is not that it cannot be passed
 isliye taiyaari kiijie or civil services kii pariksha paas karne kii ji-tod koshish kiijie
 When you have already thought of becoming an IAS or IPS officer, believe in yourself and start preparing
 short turm course:beatech kar chuke hai or naukari nahin mil rahi he to short turm course karen
 Take short term courses related to the field of b
tech
 haa, ye jarur dekh len ki jo course aap karne ja rahe hai usamen naukari milane kii kitni sambhaavnaaen market main maujuud hai
 For example, if you have done btech, you can do courses like VLSI (very-large-scale integration), Robotics, Ethical Hacking, Protocol Testing, Machine Designing
 isse aapako course or morkett main sambhavit jaruraton ke mutabik nolej hogi or naukari milane main aasaani hogi
 Give jobs to others: Most people do jobs after studying, why not give jobs to yourself
 matlab, kyon naa aap koi bijness karen
 This is a better option
 bijness shuru karne se pehle yah sunishchit kar len ki aap bijness hi karenge or bijness main usee tarah se man lagaakar kaam karenge jaisaa ki naukari main kiya jaataa he
 That is, there should be no carelessness and laziness
 market main utaar-chadhaav aaenge lekin apane lakshya par tike rahanaa hoga
 Because you are doing business, you will also keep some people with you
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki aap naukari karne ke bajaay logon ko naukari dene ke kaabil honge
 Go abroad for studies: This is also a better option
 aap hair studies or research ke liye videsh ja sakate hai
 This will give you new exposure
 ho saktaa he ki videsh main hi naukari mil jaae or phir aap vahiin settle bhi ho jaaen
 You can also take help of scholarship to make your dream of studying abroad
 sena main kariyar:bete ke baad army, navy yaa airpors ke technical department main naukari kii ja sakati he
 You can pursue a career in defense after btech by passing the University Entry Scheme (UES) and Air Force Common Admission Test (AFCAT)
 logon ke bhagya vidhaataa bane:kyon naa asahaay logon ke hiton ke liye ladaa jaae
 To fulfill this objective, you can join with any NGO (NGO)
 ye bhi ho saktaa he ki aap jis kshetra ke bare main jaanate ho uske madhyam se asahaay logon ko muft salaah di jaae
 Live for yourself: We are always busy
 koi kaam shuru karne se pehle ham ye sochane lagate hai ki doosraa kya sochega
 Leave others, make your own life
 vahi kar daalo jo karnaa chaahate ho
 It keeps the mind on doing the favorite thing, live every moment happily and also produces better output
 ho saktaa he log aapaki pansad ko naapnsad karen, lekin kya aap dusron ko khush karne ke liye khud kii jindagi badtar nahin bana rahe
 You can do painting, photography, writing work, becoming a dancer
 iske alaava bhi kai kshetra hai jahaan se aap khud kii pasand kii jindagi jikar khushi paa sakate hai
 Everyone in the country and the world wants to keep their body fit and fit
 iske liye vah khaane-pine ke saath-saath rojaanaa vyaayaam par bhi khaas dhyaan detaa he
 But we wait till one age to make 'six Pack Abs' and 'at Pack Abs'

 Interestingly, Ashwin did this charisma after 36 years

 On this occasion, read those statements which brought the thinking and philosophy of Vivekananda's 'vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' to the world - utho, jaago or tab tak nahin ruko jab tak lakshya naa praapt ho jaae
 Truth can be told in a thousand ways, yet each will be true
 kabhi mat sochie ki aatma ke liye kuch asambhav he
 Thinking like this is the greatest heresy
 agar koi paap he, to wo yahi he; ye kahana ki tum nirbal ho yaa anya nirbal hai
 Do not bow your head in front of anyone else except your conscience
 jab tak tum yah anubhav nahin karte ki tum swayan devon ke dev ho, tab tak tum mukt nahin ho sakate
 The more we go out and do good for others, the more pure our heart will be and God will dwell in it
 utho mere shero, is bhram ko mitaa do ki tum nirbal ho, tum ek amar aatma ho, svachhand jeev ho, dhanya ho, sanathan ho, tum tatv nahin ho, na hi sharir ho, tatv tumhaara sevak he tum tatv ke sevak nahin ho
 You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself
 aadhyatmik drushti se viksit ho chukne par dharmasangh main bane rahanaa avaanchhneeya he
 Get out of it and live in the free air of freedom
 us vyakti ne amartv praapt kar liya he, jo kisi sansaarik vastu se vyakul nahin hota
 If money helps to do good to others, then it has some value, otherwise, it is just a pile of evil and the sooner it gets rid of it, the better
 vishwa ek vyaayaamashaala he, jahaan ham khud ko majboot banane ke liye aate hai
 All the powers of the universe are already ours
 wo ham hai jo apni ankhon par haath rakh lete hai or phir rote hai ki kitna andhkaar he!kisi kii ninda na karen
 If you can raise your hand to help, then definitely increase
 agar nahin badha sakate, to apane haath jodie, apane bhaaiyon ko aashirwad dijie or unhen unke maarg par jane dijie
 In this world, all distinctions are of some level and not of type, because unity is the secret of all things
 jis tarah se vibhinn stroton se utpann dharaaen apana jal samudr main mila detii hai, usee prakaar manushya dwaara chunaa har maarg, chaahe acha ho yaa bura bhagwaan tak jaataa he
 The more our moral nature is advanced, the higher our direct experience and the more our will power becomes stronger

 cricket ke maidan par vaise to aapane kai haroonges karname dekhen honge lekin australia ke ek cricket match ke dauraan ek aisi ghatana ghati jo shaayad hi kabhi cricket itihaas main ghati ho
 Actually, during the match of mid-year Cricket Association of Australia, the bowler bowled a batsman but the bails above the stump did not fall down
 mooni veli or sthretmor hits ke bich match main ballebaaj jatinder singh kaa gendbaaj ne middle stump uda diya lekin haroonges tareeke se donon bels of or leg stump par ataki rah gai
 The umpires were also surprised to see the incident and were confused whether to give the batsman out or not
 kyon nahin udi gilliayampire ne kaaphi samay liya or phir soch-vichaar karne ke baad ballebaaj jatinder singh ko out de diya
 Captain Michael Ozbon of Muni Veli said, 'we did not know what would have been the result of this incident, but we thought it out with a little thought
 aap aisa dobaaraa hote hue bilkul nahin dekhnaa chahenge
 It was an impossible scene where Bells stayed on 2 stumps and after the middle stump was uprooted, the empty space started to appear
 gend bich ke stump par lagane ke baad stump uda nahin stump vahiin gir gaya
 Due to which Bells stayed on both the remaining stumps
 kya kehete he cricket ke niyamemasisi ke cricket niyam 28 ke anusaar bels kaa stamps par se puri tarah girnaa out mana jaataa he
 If the bells stop at the moving stumps, it is not ruled out
 lau ke pehle bhaag main likhaa gaya he ki wicket out jab mana jaataa he, jab bels achche se stamps ke upar se gir jaae yaa phir stump puraa ukhd jaae
 But in this incident the batsman's stump had fallen and the bells had remained high, then everyone was confused as to what to declare this result

 bismillahir rahamanir rahimapyari anitha,tumhaara tohfa pasand ayah chamakdaar gahare gale vaali ghaghara cholii
 Sadly, i won't be able to wear it much
 darasal, main ise hijaab ke neeche pahenti hum or jab aasapaas mard nahin hote to hijaab utaar detii hum! mere nae abbu is bare main kuch nahin jaanate
 i have hidden it in the attic along with Ammi's other clothes
 laila ne jab mujhe tumhaara 20 saal baad bharat vaala niabandh bheja tha, tabhi se main tumhaare bare main roj sochati hum
 i was forced to read it and think what Pakistan would look like in 2032! You have given so many figures to understand your forecast, i wanted to do the same
 ammi ne mujhe internet par kai dilachasp chijen khojane main madad kii ki hamaare desh 20 saal baad kaise honge
 After all, she has been an economist in Cambridge
 unhen to meri fantasy main jamkar majaa aayaa!chunki kuch bade or ahm log lagaataar yah baat kehete rahete hai ki hamen tumhaare desh ke saath kadam se kadam milakar chalanaa chahie kyonki do baraabar log hi ek-duusare kaa sammaan kar sakate hai
 Ammi says that it seems that today we are more or less equal
 maanav vikaas suchakank main tum log 134 par ho or ham 141 number par, ab iskaa jo bhi matlab hota ho
 But Ammi also says that if we remain like this, then in 2032 there will be a big difference between us
 agle 20 saal main tum logon kaa jidipi mere hisaab se 4 trillian dollar ho jayega, yani hamaare 0
 About ten times against 43 trillion dollars! Ammi says that GDP is the real power because both have bombs
 ammi bataati hai ki har hindustani kii everej jidipi 1,055 dollar he jabaki har pakistani kii 975 dollar
 This difference is not very big, only five dollars a month! But in the next 20 years, every person there will earn double of you there
 jab maine unase poocha kaise to unhone bataaya ki bada fark is baat se tay hota he ki ham mahilaon, shiksha or fouj par kis tarah nivesh karte hai
 It seems that we spend more part of GDP on our army than you
 ammi kahati hai ki yadi ham aise hi kharch karte rahe, to 20 saal baad tum apane jidipi kaa 50waan hissaa fouj par kharch kar rahi hogi jabaki tumhaare jitani badi fouj ko banaae rakhane ke liye hamen apane jidipi kaa 10waan hissaa lagaana padegaa
 This will hurt us a lot because for this we will have to borrow more and cut down everything else
 pehle hi mujhe kitni kam chijen muhaiyaa hai
 Isn't it strange that by 2032, the two countries will be spending 100 billion dollars just to buy weapons? But Ammi's biggest concern is about our women
 ve kahati hai ki tumhaare vahaan tab zyada auraten padhane or naukari karne lag jaaengi jabaki unhen dar he ki hamamen se kam hi pard or kaam par ja paaengi
 He told that the number of men and women working in you will be equal, but we will have a woman working on four men
 ve nae kism ke skool banane ko lekar bhi khaufjada hai
 She is also afraid of the new rules related to dress and the decrees heard daily
 sab log zyada bachche paidaa kar rahe hai
 Look at Ammi, the fourth is the first from my new father
 mujhe bhi ab dhire-dhire ammi kii tarah unki aadat pad rahi he
 She says that my real father and his men were killed by our new father
 ammi to hamen bachaane ke liye 'swaara' ke naam par unke ghar chali ain: ab ham unki jaaydaad hai or unka kaam he hamen bachaana
 This was the way to save our lives and pacify the people fighting on both sides
 main ab ghar par rahane lagi hum kyonki ammi ko gharelu kaam ke liye or sabase choti bahan ko sanbhaalane ke liye madad kii jarurat thi
 My youngest sister just turned two years old yesterday
 main apane puraane skool international convent ko, uski skirt ko, angreji kii kitabon ko or videshi teacheron ko miss karti hum
 Abbu does not want me to continue studying after next year
 ittefaq se vahaan net thik chalata he isliye main laila kii madad se landan ke ek skool ke online lesan pard paati hum
 How different is the world of women here! TV channels of your country are also coming to us and often there is news of shooting of Hindustani films there
 karina khan pataudi jab islamabad ai thim to khushkismati se use maine bhi dekha tha
 You can't think how i felt
 aaj bhi kitni khubasurat he
 She did not wear hijab and she was also dancing with all the men here
 mere bhai dilawar or farid ke din achche guzar rahe hai
 Nowadays a lot of work is going on here, new roads are being built, power houses are being built
 kai log yahaan bijness ke liye or ghoomane-phirane aa rahe hai
 Most are Hindustani but also from other countries
 lag rahaa he sab thik hi hoga, kuch nai dukaane bhi khul gai hai
 Yes, we will have re-election this year
 mujhe iske myne nahin pataa, lekin bade-bujurg kaaphi utsahit hai, jaise ham log cricket festival par hote hai
 The leaders talk about the world in their speeches and say that the time has come for Pakistan to gain momentum
 nae netaa ne videsh ke skool-college main padhane ke liye wajife kaa elaan kiya he jaisaa ki sabhi karte aae hai
 Ammi says that more and more people are turning to the west to work
 ammi baharhaal khush hai aajkal, dinabhar ek hindustani geet gunagunaati rahati hai jisamen ek parinda apane pinjre se baahar nikalne ke intjaar main he taaki vah khule akaash main aaazaad ud sake
 She pats her stomach lightly and says, "if you are lucky, you will open your eyes in London!" i tell you a secret
 ammi ke doston ne mere parivaar ke imigration ke liye aavedan kar diya he
 She says that due to 'swara' we will get refugee status
 khayr, 20 saal baad ham dobaaraa apni-apni chitthiyaan padhenge taaki jaan saken ki ham kitne baraabar hue hai or hamaari auraten, fujen apni takat ke bare main kya sochati hai
 i hope that i will be able to wear the ghagra-choli presented to my children by you

 a United Nations statutory panel announced on Friday that wikileaks founder Julian Assange should be released and given compensation for 'deprivation of freedom'
 bibisi kii report ke mutabik asanj (44) par dushkarm ke ek maamle main giraftaar hokar sweden pratyrpit hone kii talwaar latak rahi he
 He has denied the misdemeanor charge
 unhone 2012 se landan main ecuador ke duutavas main sharan lee hui he
 The un's 'working Group Dealing With Arbitrary Detention Matters' said Assange's detention should now be abolished, respecting his freedom of movement
 kaarysmooh ne kaha, 'asanj ko muaavje kaa adhikaar diya janaa chahie
 The workgroup said Assange was initially victimized in a number of ways that deprived him of independence when he was held in solitary confinement for 10 days in London's Wandsworth Prison
 7 disambar 2010 ko britain main giraftaar ke baad se unhen lagaataar unki aazaadee se vanchit rakhaa gaya
 The panel said they were kept under house arrest and then 'imprisoned' at the Ecuadorian embassy
 is bich, britain ke videsh mantralay pravaktaa ne kaha, 'julian asanj ko britain main kabhi bhi manamaane tareeke se hiraasat main nahin rakhaa gaya
 Comments asanj teen saal se ecuador ke duutavas main rah rahe hai
 He complained to the United Nations in September 2014 that he had been arbitrarily detained as he would be arrested as soon as he exited the embassy
 isi vajah se vah duutavas main fanse pade hai
 The complaint against Britain and Sweden states that Assange has been denied his freedom for an unacceptably long period
 asanj ne guuruuvaar ko twit kiya tha ki agar sanyukt raashtra panel unke paksh main faisla detaa he to unhen unka passport lautaaya janaa chahie or unke khilaaf jari giraftaar warrant ko radd kiya janaa chahie
 He had said that if the verdict does not come in his favor, he will get out of the embassy and get arrested by the British police
 sanyukt raashtra ke 'manamaane hiraasat se jude maamalon ko dekhne vaale kaarysmooh' ne kaha ki asanj kii hiraasat ko ab khatm kiya janaa chahie, unke aazaadee se aane-jane kaa sammaan kiya janaa chahie
 The Working Group said, 'assange should be given the right to compensation
 ' kaarysmooh ne kaha ki asanj ko shuru main us samay aazaadee se vanchit karne vaale kai tareekon kaa shikaar banaaya gaya jab unhen 2010 main landan kii wandsworth jail main 10 din ke liye ekant main band kiya gaya tha
 Since his arrest in Britain on 7 December 2010, he has been consistently denied his freedom
 panel ne kaha ki unhen ghar main giraftaar rakhaa gaya or phir ecuador ke duutavas main 'kaid' kar diya gaya
 Meanwhile, a UK Foreign Ministry spokesman said, 'julian Assange was never arbitrarily detained in Britain
 'tippaniyan Assange has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy for three years
 unhone sitambar 2014 main sanyukt raashtra se shikaayat kii thi ki unhen manamaane tareeke se hiraasat main rakhaa gaya he kyonki duutavas se baahar nikalate hi unhen giraftaar kar liya jayega
 For this reason, he is trapped in the embassy
 britain or sweden ke khilaaf di gai shikaayat main kaha gaya he ki asanj ko ek asweekaarya lambii avadhi tak ke liye unki aazaadee se vanchit kiya gaya he
 Assange tweeted on Thursday that if the UN panel decides in his favor, he should return his passport and the arrest warrant issued against him should be canceled
 unhone kaha tha ki agar faisla unke paksh main nahin aayega to vah duutavas se baahar nikal kar british police ke haathon giraftaar ho jaaenge

 twitter
 com / coqjcjbfac— sunrisers Hyderabad (@sunrisers)march 18, 2015sunrisers ne buudhvaar kii der raat twit karke isaki ghoshnaa kii
 The team said in its tweet, 'congratulations to Warner on becoming the captain of Sunrisers Hyderabad for IPL-8
 aapkaa bhavishya ujjwal ho
 Warner had said last year that he is keen to lead the Australian team one day and captaining the IPL team will give him a chance to prove his leadership potential
 'warner isse pehle australia ke tii-20 lig toornament 'big bash lig' ke pehle sijan main sidney thanders team ke liye final match main captaini kar chuke hai
 Warner scored a century in that match, on which his team became the champion
 -input bhashaa se Almost all political pundits and the entire media are assuming that the Congress is nowhere in this election
 muqaabala sirf bijepi or aam aadmi party ke bich he
 It is also being speculated that the Congress will find it difficult to get eight seats this time
 uski siten ghat sakati hai
 He may be in a worse condition than the last assembly election
 lekin congress lagaataar yah jataane kii koshish kar rahi he ki ham bhi res main hai
 Whether it is Ajay Maken, the chairman of the campaign committee or the state president Arvinder Singh Lovely, the Congress is making consistent claims of better performance
 daawey to chunaav nattejey aane ke thik pehle tak chalate rahete hai
 By the way, by showing the crowd of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia's rally, they are also trying to assure that the voters are returning to it
 akhir congress ko kyon aisa lagata he ki jis dilli ne use takht se uthaa kar sadak par laa diya, vahi dilli ek saal Will treat her respectfully within
 iske peeche party kii kuch apni gananaa he or kuch usase jude akalan
 The Congress feels that there is a sense of disappointment from the work of the Modi government in the last 8 months
 yani vah maan kar chal rahi he ki in aath maheenon main centre sarkaar ke khilaaf jo anti inakambency factor paidaa hua he use vah apane paksh main bhunaa paaegi, lekin vah shaayad yah bhul rahi he ki agar centre kii modi sarkaar ke khilaaf koi anti inakambency paidaa hua he to vah congress se zyada majboot daavedaar maani ja rahi aam aadmi party ke paksh main jayega
 But here the Congress is assuming that because Arvind Kejriwal resigned in 49 days, his responsibility se bhaag gaye the or janata kaa un par bharosa tutaa
 This makes the Congress feel that instead of Kejriwal doing it, he is protesting raajnneeti se madhya varg ke jis ek tabake kaa mohabhang hua vah congress kii taraf lautega
 Many of Kejriwal's election promises started changing colors as soon as he came to power and the Congress is confident that the voters have remembered this
 janata darbar lagane se lekar sangam vihaar jaise ilaaqon main vaade ke hisaab se pani pahunchane tak, aam aadmi party satta main aane ke baad vaadon ko puraa karne kii mushkilon se do-chaar hui or us par sawaal uthe
 The Congress is trying hard to get the land it had lost to the Aam Aadmi Party
 lekin kai jamini She is probably deliberately ignoring the facts
 jaise, vah jhuggi waalon ko pakke makaan kaa adhikaar dene sambandhi From the matter of making laws to one and a half rupees per unit of electricity, they are engaged in every possible effort to woo them
 lekin vah bhul Kejriwal's biggest strength has been that police rule in over 49 days was to overcome corruption
 jhuggi bastiyon main rahane vaala bada tabaka jo rehadi patari par apni duukaan laga kar apni jeevika chalaata he, uske liye yah kisi vardaan se kam nahin tha
 As soon as Kejriwal goes, he says that the police also came to collect arrears
 kalka ji jahaan rahul gandhi ne bada road sho kiya, vahaan kai jhuggi waalon kaa kahana he ki bijli to ve do rupee bhi le lenge
 If the police collects the recovery of 30 rupees every day, then the money is saved
 vaise police vaale 1000 rupee maheene kii bajaay 2000 kii maang karne lage hai
 In such a situation, curbing corruption means the most to these people and the Congress, which has faced corruption charges in the last elections, is unable to give any firm credence to this corruption issue
 haalanki ghoshnaptr se lekar har manch se vah bhi bhrashtachar se ladane kii baat kar rahi he
 Aam Aadmi Party can be harmed by Congress in one case
 agar congress kisi bhi tarah kuch vot aam aadmi party se chhinane main kaamyaab rahati he to bijepi ke saath uske margin par asar padegaa
 This will happen when the BJP is able to keep its votes intact
 congress kii siten beshak na badha paae, lekin agar wo apane vot badhaane main kaamayaab ho jaae to iskaa sidhaa faaydaa bijepi ko hoga
 If the Congress votes decrease, then the Aam Aadmi Party will have the advantage
 jaise agar kisi cricket test match main jis team se jeet bahut dur ho or use haar kaa khatara sata rahaa ho tab vah match drow karaane ke liye khilne lagati he
 Congress is also playing to draw matches
 dilli ke chunavi maidan main match drow kaa matlab phir se hang assembly he
 Therefore, in the face of hung assembly, the Congress feels that in the next match it will be able to field in a much better condition
 philhal uskaa puraa jor pichhali baar jiti aath siton ke alaava un solah siton par he jisamen vah duusare number par rahi thi
 Apart from these 24 seats, the seat of Shueb Iqbal is inclusive of 25 seats
 in 25 main wo 17-18 par puri taaqat chonk rahi he
 The attempt is to reach the double digit from one unit
 isliye uske netaa maan rahe hai ham bhi hai res main
 
 
 The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is investigating about 4,000 licenses issued to pilots in the last one year after several pilots were accused of taking licenses to fly aircraft using fake documents
 dijisie ke pramukh bharat bhushan ne kaha, "license ke liye payalton dwaara farji ankapatr dena ek badi samasya he
 We will examine all pilot licenses issued in the last one year
 inaki sankhya teen se chaar hajaar ke bich he
 "the action was launched following the arrest of Air India pilot JK verma on Saturday
 un par farji ankapatr ke sahare payalat license hasil karne kaa aarope he
 This is the second such arrest in the last one week

 We have received a complaint against two other pilots - Meenakshi Sehgal of indigo and Swaran Singh Talwar of MDLR
 in par bhi farji dastavejon ke sahare license hasil karne kaa andeh he
 "both are absconding at the moment
 bhushan ne kaha, "gulati ke maamle main unke vimaan utaarne kii takanic main kuch khami thi
 When we checked his record it was shocking
 unhone farji ankapatr ke sahare license hasil kiya tha, jisaki pushti nahin kii gai thi
 "he said," After doubts arose about some other similar cases, the DGCA got them investigated and many more such cases came to light
 jaanch jari he
 So far, four such cases have been reported, out of which two - Gulati and Verma - have been arrested
 " All rounder Shane Watson, who was dropped from the Australian team, admits his mistake, but also says that it was difficult to accept such a 'severe' punishment for the violation of that protocol
 watasan ne coach ko pregentation nahin saunpi thi, jo ki protocol kaa ullaghann mana gaya
 Watson told reporters after an 18-hour-long flight from India, 'I accept that what i did was wrong
 lekin apane desh kii test team se nilambit kiye jane kii baat sweekaar karnaa mere liye bahut hi mushkil hoga
 Watson and three of his teammates, fast bowlers James Pattinson, Mitchell Johnson and batsman Usman Khawaja were dropped from the squad for the third Test against India for not accepting the order of the team management
 watasan ne kaha, ‘mujhe kuch anya khilaadiyon ke saath test match se baahar kar diya gaya, jo mujhe bahut galat lagata he kyonki isse mujhase ek test match chin gaya
 He (management group) must have certainly thought that this was the right decision for the team at this time
 ’ unhone kaha ki anushaasahinata ke kaaran test match nahin khel paane se main bahut tut gaya tha
 Watson said, 'it has been because of injury throughout my career that i have not been able to play a Test match
 ' The ruling BJP and the opposition Congress in Madhya Pradesh have come face to face with the condition of national highways in the state and are accusing each other in various ways

 Chauhan said that due to the plight of the national highways in the state, he is going to make such a request to the central government because the central government is doing nothing to maintain the highways
 madhyapradesh bhaajapa ke adhyaksh prabhaat jha ne chouhan kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki pradesh main rashtriya rajmargon kii haalat itani kharaab ho gai he ki ab sadakon main gaddon ke bajaay gaddon main sadaken najar aati hai

 bjp-shiv Sena stuck on formation of government in Maharashtra: Political turmoil is going on for the formation of a government in Paramharashtra by RSS
 shivasena or bijepi donon apane-apane kadam peeche khinchne ko taiyaar nahin hai or donon ne rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke dar par dastak di he
 The Shiv Sena has demanded an intervention from the RSS chief in this matter
 vahiin, mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne mangalvaar ko nagpur aresas mukhyalay jaakar sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat se mulaakaat kii
 In such a situation, now the ball of formation of Maharashtra government is in the court of RSS and to see what political path Mohan Bhagwat takes in it? iske baavjood bhi bijepi or shivasena ke bich siyaasi khinchataan jari he
 BJP stands on its old stand and does not want to leave the post of CM under any circumstances
 jabaki, shivasena mukhyamantri pad ko lekar apana daawa or 50-50 formule kii shart rakh rahi he
 Due to this, the matter of government formation in Maharashtra hangs in the balance
 shivasena ko aresas kaa saharaamaharashtra main mukhyamantri pad par khinchataan ke bich shivasena ne kishor tiwari ne somvaar ko aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ko patr likhakar dakhal dene kii maang kii he
 The Shiv Sena leader has urged the Sangh chief to mediate with Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on the formation of the government, so that the ongoing dispute between BJP and Shiv Sena can be resolved by consensus
 itnaa hi nahin shivasena ne devendra fadanvis ko vyaktivaadee bataaya or nitin gadakari ke jariye gatirodh ko khatm karne kii baat kahi he
 The Sangh and the BJP want to be put to blows The Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis reached Nagpur on Tuesday night and met Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat on the very next day after Shiv Sena knocked on the RSS rate
 fadanvis sangh mukhyalay main kareeb dedh ghante tak rahe or mana ja rahaa he ki is dauraan unhone sangh pramukh ko ko maujuuda sthiti or sambhavit sthitiyon ke bare main jaankaree di
 After the meeting, both the Sangh and the BJP remain silent
 siem fadanvis ne bhi koi bayaan nahin diya or na hi sangh kii ore se koi baat kahi gai
 If sources are to be believed, BJP and RSS also do not want to take any threat in Maharashtra
 yahi vajah he ki abhi tak sarkaar gathan kii disha main bijepi ne kisi tarah kii koi jaldbaaji nahin kii he
 What will the Sangh find out for the formation of the government? The Sangh said if the BJP cannot postpone it, the Shiv Sena also cannot go against the wishes of the RSS
 aise main shivasena or devendra fadanvis kii mulaakaat ke baad maharashtra kii siyaasi raah nikaalane kii jimmedaari sangh ke kandhon par aa gai he
 In such a situation, it is to be seen now that which formula of government formation in RSS Maharashtra comes out, on which both BJP and Shiv Sena can be seen as Rajmand? Tell us that out of total 288 assembly seats in Maharashtra, BJP 105, Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 And Congress has got 44 seats
 jabaki, 13 nirdaleey bhi jeet hasil kar vidhansabha pahunche hai
 To form a government in the state, any party needs 145 mlas

 Nothing goes beyond the staff of the government tents and tents and the pilgrimage to Kedarnath, as soon as the staff arrives here in Haghati, realizing that the tragedy that people imagine while sitting far away is actually deeper than that

 About a decade and a half ago, when the Ganges changed its course in Patna, many people got a chance to change their fortunes on this excuse
 jahaan se 15 saal pehle ganga kalakal karti bahati thi, usee ganga ke god main bhu-mafiyaan ne dekhte-dekhat bade apartments khadey kar die
 After the Kedarnath accident, the government also lost sleep but by then the concrete jungle had started settling in the lap of Ganga, but this year when Ganga returned to her old blood, the senses of Patnaites were blown away
 aaj ganga kaa pani in ban rahe apartments ko na sirf chhu chukaa he balki kai apartments to ganga ke bichobich najar aane lage hai
 This is the area of digha-kurji in Patna and that of Rajapur where dozens of ghats along the banks of the Ganges have now become mere memories of the Ganges
 in ghaaton se kai sau meter aage ganga kii god main ab aapako rihaayshi ashiyane najar aaege lekin bhala ho ganga me ai baadh kaa jisane is saal bhu-mafiyaan or sarkari mili bhagat kii kalai kholkar rakh di
 Where a few years ago, the Ganges used to flow in its velocity, there are multi-storeyed buildings built today
 bilkul ganga kii god main bane in bahumanjili imaaraton kaa alam ye he vahaan jane ke liye bhi naav se pahunchnaa hoga
 Looking at the past few years, there has been a flood of multi-storey buildings, although no building has been built till now, but in the coming time it will be a picture of the city settled in the lap of Ganga
 ganga ke kinare based logon kii maane to ye jameen ganga ke kinar based gaanvvaalon or madhuaaron kii jameen he jis par bhu-mafiaon ne apni buree najar daal rakhi he
 'water in the basement of the building' Local farmer and life-saving fish in the Ganges, Satendra says that the building which is built here has enough water in its basement, the life and death of it will be in the hands of Gangaji
 ye madhuaaron kii jaminen he lekin jidhar dekhie chaaron taraf apartment ban rahaa ganga main, ise aap ganga kii god hi samajhie,jab suukhta he to yahaan kheti hoti hai
 While other farmers believe of Shivam, it has been being built in the Ganges for three to four years and these are the land of the farmers where the farmers cultivate
 ye ganga kii god main jameen he par phir bhi sarkaar order kaise detaa he, ye samaj main nahin aata he
 There can be a lot of danger here when the water dries, there is a lot of swamp here, we get trapped in it
 How is the apartment being built here? It is beyond comprehension
 After the flood of 1975, the government built a dam on the banks of the Ganges and dam The area outside of it has been declared a flood zone
 ye ilaaka patna nagar nigam ke andar bhi nahin aata lekin bilderon ne is sarkari mili bhagat se apane kabje main lenaa shuru kar diya
 In the last few years, plans began to pass on these lands and PRDA started to pass up to the map but on seeing more, multi-storey buildings flooded
 lekin kedarnath haadase ke baad na sirf sarkaar kii neend tuuti balki adaalat ne bhi yahan nirmaan par roak laga di
 Now the same builders are cursing the government as to why the government allowed them to build buildings there
 meredian cancetruction limited ke siemdi abu dojaanaa kehete hai ki-hamen nahin lagata he hamane koi galati kii he, hame nahin lagata ki ye flud jone he, sarkari dastavej me agar ye flud aria he to sarkaar ne hamen kyon parmishan diya ki tum banaao building
 The government is doing votebank politics
 'darasal sarkaar tab jaagi jab patna hoicourt kii dabl bench ne ise avaidh bataate hue do maheene pehle roak laga di
 It was argued that residential buildings in the lap of the Ganges can be built on people's lives
 magar in bilderon kii daleel he ki sarkaar agar unhen ijaajat de to wo ganga main burj khalipha bana denge
 On the other hand, the Mayor of Patna, Afzal Imam claims that mistakes were made earlier but are now taking action
 ganga ke bich main kancreet kaa jangalakaise bas rahaa he ganga ke bich main kancreet kaa jangal, ye kahani bhi kam dilachasp nahin he
 The land mafia and builders started buying the lands of the people living along the Ganges
 ganga kinare kii jameen kharidkar ye bhu-mafia ganga ke bheetar tak jameen kharidte or atikaraman karte chale gaye
 Pakistan has provoked India again
 is baar uksaane kii karrwai khufia agency iesai ke chif ahamed shuja pasha ne kii he
 Pasha has threatened that if India attacks on the lines of the US like Abbottab, it will get a full response in return as Pakistan has set targets in India
 osama bin laden maamle main duniya bhar se aalochanaon kii baadh main dub chukaa pakistan ab bharat ke khilaaf aag ugalkar shaayad isse ubarna chahta he yaa apni janata or duniya kaa dhyaan bhatkaana chahta he
 That is why Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the head of the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, has threatened India
 don akhbaar ke mutabik pasha ne kaha he ki agar bharat abtabad jaise hamale kii koshish karata he, to use puraa jawaab milegaa
 According to the newspaper, Pasha has also said that Pakistan has set the target of the attack in India and rehearsals have also been done for it

 It is believed that this threat of Pasha is the result of the statement in which Army Chief General of India VK Singh said that he too has the ability to enter into Pakistan like America and execute any action like Operation Osama

 Despite the frequent denials of the US, Shuja Pasha again said that the information gained from ISI is a very important role behind the American success against terrorism

 a few days ago during his Gujarat visit, Rahul Gandhi questioned the bjp's claims of development and joked that (under the bjp's rule in Gujarat) "vikas Gando Thayo Chhe" (vikas has gone mad), The challenge that was presented, the visit was said to be his retort
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne yatra ko jhandi dikhaate hue prabhavi bhaashan diya or doharaaya ki bhaajapa is saal disambar main hone vaale chunaavon main 150 siten jeetegi
 Shah presented data on the state's development until 1995, during the Congress rule and under the bjp's rule in the last two decades
 bhaajapa kaa record kai guna behatar najar aata he, jaise prati vyakti aay, jo 1995 main prati varsh 13,000 ru
 Was increased to 1 in 2016
 41 lakh ru
 Has reached (although it must be taken in the context that the country's economy has also grown rapidly in the same period)
 or iske baavjood bhaajapa ke baari bahumat se jeetne yaa yahaan tak ki ek suvidhajanak jeet hasil karne ke daawey ke bare main ek andeh bana hua he
 At the same meeting, some Patel youths present in the crowd shouted anti-bjp slogans
 patel aarakshan samarthak netaa hardik patel ke samarthakon ko turat-phurat vahaan se dur le jaaya gaya
 Apparently no one believes that the BJP will lose in the upcoming elections, but the victorious winds that have been blown by the speed of the thunderstorm a month ago have slowed down
 surat, rajkot or jamnagar jaise audyogic kshetron main kaarobaar ko buree tarah se prabhavit kar rahi jiesti jaisi ek asthaayee baadha bhi rajya bhaajapa kaaryakartaaon ko apana nayaa naaraa ''aa vakhat 150" (is baar 150 siten) puri takat lagane se roak rahi he
 The party coined the slogan soon after the BJP won 325 seats in Uttar Pradesh, and even happily chanted it by the end of August
 jahaan bhaajapa pradhanmantri narendra modi ke grih rajya ko barkaraar rakhane ke liye yuddh str kii taiyaari kar rahi he, vahiin hardik ke lagaataar hallaa machaane ke kaaran bhi kaaryakartaaon main shanti he
 a section of Patel youth is with him; It is a community that has been a pillar of the BJP in Gujarat
 hardik ne apane samarthakon ke liye kai sari siton kaa congress party ke saath kathith taur par ek samjhauta kar liya he
 At its level, the state government has promised to explore economic and social benefits for the 51 percent upper castes of the state (most of whom are Patels)
 sarkaar ne 2015 main aarakshan andolan ke dauraan patel yuvaaon par kathith police atyaacharon kii jimmedaari tay karne ke liye ek ayog ke gathan kaa bhi vaada kiya tha
 Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani says Hardik has lost his support
 mukhyamantri kehete hai, ''unhone congress tak pahunchakar apni rajnatik mahatvakanksha spasht kar di he, isliye patel adhikaron ke liye andolan karne vaale ke rup main unki sthiti khatm ho gai he
 They have no land left
 " roopaani ne yah kahkar chunauti bhi pesh kii ki ''hardik chahen to khud chunaav ladakar dekh len
 "meanwhile the situation in the opposition Congress party seems to be getting better
 haal hi ke samay tak guton main vibhajit party, jo rajya main apni rajnatik pahchaan banaae rakhane ke liye sangharsh kar rahi thi, us congress ne logon ko kuch aakarshith karnaa shuru kar diya he, jaisaa ki pichley hafte rahul gandhi kii gujarat yatra ko mili pratikriya main dikhaai diya he
 In fact, with the party unit chief Shankarsinh Vaghela leaving the party — who cross-voted in Ahmed Patel's Rajya Sabha election — the party has strangely united
 haalanki rahul ne apni gujarat navasarjan yatra ke dauraan saarvajanik sabhaaon main koi bahut baari pradarshan nahin kiya tha, lekin unhen adhikansh rajnatik panditon kii raay main behatar pratikriya mili thi
 Now that both the parties are getting ready for the final strike, Gujarat is presenting the most interesting electoral scenario
 pradhanmantri modi ke liye, yah ek mahatvapurn ladaai he jiskaa asar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main duusare kaarykaal ke liye unke daawey par padegaa
 They do not just have to win Gujarat, but win it with a good margin
 congress ke liye, yah modi or shah kaa khel bigaad dene kaa ek avasar he
 And so both parties are preparing for such a battle in this western state, which has never been fought before
 haalanki abhi bhi bahut kuch jatigat samikarnon par nirbhar karegaa
 For example, Hardik's nexus with the Congress could force castes like the OBC Kshatriyas - who had protested against the Patel benefits of reservation - towards the BJP camp
 iske alaava, prashn yah bhi he ki hardik patelon ke kitne voton kaa rukh mode sakate hai
 The saffron party, the Bhagwa Party, believes that Rahul Gandhi has played into his hands by waging a debate on development
 party pravaktaa bharat pandya kehete hai, ''agar sushasan mudda ho, to koi bhi aisa maandand nahin he, jisamen bhaajapa congress par baari na padati ho
 This debate is exactly on our way
 " ''vikaas gando thayo che" ke congress ke naare ke khilaaf, bhaajapa ne apana naaraa gadha he— ''hun chhun vikaas, hun chhu gujarat" (main vikaas hum, main gujarat hum)
 The party has also prepared a list of at least 100 government parameters, which compares the progress made during the Congress regime with the progress made during the BJP rule
 booth prabandhan paksh main bhi pramukh ranneetikaar amit shah ne party ko chust kar diya he
 Around 50,000 workers have been deployed to look after some 50,000 booths
 iske alaava, booth str par party ke 500 vistaarak hai
 The party's feedback process regarding the selection of tickets was completed by 24 September
 is prakriya ke dauraan party ko udyogon par jiesti ke nakaaratmak prabhaav or naukariyon kii sthiti kaa ehsaas hua
 The state government immediately came in contact with the center and in most of the districts small businessmen held meetings with the central and state tax authorities
 mukhyamantri roopaani kehete hai, ''yahaan tak ki jila colectoron ne bhi baithkon main bhaag liya, taaki ve chote vyavsaayiyon kii samasyaon ko samaj saken or unke bhay dur kar saken
 "however, as a party leader says," a lot will depend on what the GST Council does in the coming days
 " bhaajapa ke kheme main ghabrahat spasht rup se dikhaai de rahi he
 The new caution is best reflected in the fact that the BJP has appointed Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Narendra Singh Tomar as regional in-charge in the Gujarat elections
 ye donon kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ke maatahat kaam karenge
 Bhupendra Yadav is the new general secretary in charge of the state
 data hua hayendruni kalah ab ateet kii baat ho chuki he, or congress party main kuch jaan ai he
 In fact, what the Congress is jumping on today is mostly due to dissatisfaction with the BJP on issues like GST, price rise and job crisis
 rajasthan ke purv mukhyamantri ashok gahalot, jinhen is saal kii shuruyaat main gujarat kaa prabhaar saunpa gaya tha, vah bhi apana sara anubhav istemaal kar rahe hai
 Where the Congress is on the backfoot is a case of presenting a practical face against Chief Minister Rupani
 waghela ke party chhod jane ke baad, party ke paas keval ek vikalp party ke rajya pramukh bharatsingh solanki bachate hai, jo purv mukhyamantri madhavsingh solanki ke putr hai
 Solanki, once known for his fighting spirit, has softened over time
 unke alaava shakti singh gohil hai jinamein vah karishma nahin he
 Yet the Congress looks at the boom with new solidarity
 use hardik patel ke samarthakon ke alaava daliton kii naaraazgi kaa laabh milane kii bhi ummid he
 Dalit sentiments are also said to hurt recently
 is bich, pratidwandvi bhaajapa kii dekhadekhi, congress bhi pehali baar booth prabandhan par dhyaan kendrit kar rahi he
 During his visit to Gujarat, Rahul held several meetings with local leaders, with his secretary taking notes
 gahalot kaa kahana he ki ve ''koi kasar nahin chhod rahe hai
 People desire change in Gujarat
 " congress ne pichley 15 varshon main har chunaav se pehle yahi sab kaha he, or phir vah chunavi maidan main haar gai he
 This time too, it looks like a tough fight for the party
 ipel (IPL 2019) kii shuruyaat ho chuki he

 ' The death of 7-year-old child Avinash alias Bittu in Delhi from dengue and the suicide of his parents, broken by it, shook him
 jhakzor diya nijee aspataalon kii samvedanheenata ne
 The helpless parents kept circling with the child from one hospital to another, second to third and then to the fourth hospital
 
 
 
 
 
 When a place was found in a hospital, the child's breaths responded
 eklauti aulad ke chale jane kaa gam is danpati se bardaasht nahin hua
 Leap from the building and escape from the shock of a lifetime
 us danpati kii manodasha kii kalpana kar hi man sihar jaataa he
 Breathing with your child in front of your eyes, the insensitivity of the hospitals responsible for this and the rudeness of the system makes one think that the life of a common man is worth nothing
 dengue har saal aata he, har saal log iske jahrile dank se maare jate hai
 Why don't we learn from the deaths every year? It is the responsibility of our Municipal Corporation to be sprayed in the manner
 pani ko jamaa hone se bachaaya jaae, lekin civik sansthaaon ke saath-saath yah jimmedaari ham sabaki bhi he
 Dengue patients have registered a 38 percent increase this year
 beete 5 saalon main is saal dengue ne sabase zyada logon ko prabhavit kiya he
 3 -3 patients have been found lying on one bed in government hospitals
 dilli sarkaar jaagi he
 a thousand beds are going to be purchased
 kisi bhi marij ko lautaane kii ijaajat nahin he
 But when a hospital returns a patient, he does not want to think that if the patient does not find any place elsewhere, then who will be responsible for his death? is cese main pehle moolchand madsity, saket maiks or phir airin aspataal ne bachche ke maa-baap ko duusare aspataal main le jane kii salaah dekar pallaa jhaad liya
 Finally, after much sunlight, the child's father somehow arranged a bed in Batra Astpal
 bharti hone ke chand ghanton main bachche ne dam tod diya
 If he had found a place in Moolchand, Max or Irene Hospital in time, Avinash might not have lost the battle of life like this
 uske maa-baap kaa yah hashr na hota
 Dengue kills a family
 vaise yah kahana zyada sahi hoga ki aspataalon kii samvedanheenata ne ek parivaar kii jaan le lee
 The Delhi government did well to seek a reply with a warning to cancel their license
 license radd ho to sakht sandesh jayega, gar na ho to baari bharkam jurmaana to laganaa hi chahie
 The comments dengue beshak gambhir beemaari he, lekin laailaaj nahin he
 How many people fall prey to it every year and get well with treatment
 ek naagarik ke taur par dengue ke prakope ke sijan main ham sabaki yah jimmedaari banati he ki ham sajag rahen
 Do not take any fever lightly
 jaan keemtee he or iske liye ham ain maukon par bas apane aspataalon ke bharose nahin rah sakate
 We know what the ratio of government hospitals to patients is
 nijee aspataal apni manmarjee ke maalik hai
 Their accountability should increase
 bhaawanaaon ke aavesh main jaan dene vaale maa-baap kii manodasha samajhnaa kisi bhi abhibhavak ke liye mushkil nahin, lekin is hataasha or sadame main hamen yah yaad rakhana chahie ki ham jo kar sakate hai vah jarur karen or dengue kii rokthaam main saath den
 The mind is tempered by imagining the couple's mood
 apni ankhon ke saamne apane bachche kaa saath chhodti saansen, iske liye jimmedaar aspataalon kii samvedanheenata or system kii berukhi yah sochane par majaboor kar detii he ki ek aam insaan kii jaan kii kya koi keemat nahin he
 Dengue comes every year, every year people are killed by its poisonous stings
 kyon ham har saal hone vaali mauton se sabak nahin lete? yah jimmedaari hamaare nagar nigam kii he ki dhang se chhidkaav ho
 Water should be saved from freezing, but it is the responsibility of all of us along with civic institutions
 is saal dengue ke marijon main 38 fisadi kii badhottaree darj hui he
 Dengue has affected the most people this year in the last 5 years
 sarkari aspataalon main ek bed par 3 -3 marij lete paae gaye hai
 Delhi government has awakened
 ek hajaar bedon kii khariddaari hone ja rahi he

 As a citizen, during the dengue outbreak season, we all have a responsibility to be alert
 kisi bhi bukhaar ko halke main na len
 Life is precious and for this we cannot rely solely on our hospitals on these occasions

 is cese main pehle moolchand madsity, saket maiks or phir airin aspataal ne bachche ke maa-baap ko duusare aspataal main le jane kii salaah dekar pallaa jhaad liya
 Finally, after much sunlight, the child's father somehow arranged a bed in Batra Astpal
 bharti hone ke chand ghanton main bachche ne dam tod diya
 If he had found a place in Moolchand, Max or Irene Hospital in time, Avinash might not have lost the battle of life like this
 uske maa-baap kaa yah hashr na hota
 Dengue kills a family
 vaise yah kahana zyada sahi hoga ki aspataalon kii samvedanheenata ne ek parivaar kii jaan le lee
 The Delhi government did well to seek a reply with a warning to cancel their license
 license radd ho to sakht sandesh jayega, gar na ho to baari bharkam jurmaana to laganaa hi chahie
 The comments dengue beshak gambhir beemaari he, lekin laailaaj nahin he
 How many people fall prey to it every year and get well with treatment
 ek naagarik ke taur par dengue ke prakope ke sijan main ham sabaki yah jimmedaari banati he ki ham sajag rahen
 Do not take any fever lightly
 jaan keemtee he or iske liye ham ain maukon par bas apane aspataalon ke bharose nahin rah sakate
 We know what the ratio of government hospitals to patients is
 nijee aspataal apni manmarjee ke maalik hai

 Thanks for agreeing to do a program in Delhi in Dec
 House rent allowance to save income tax, ie House Rent Allowance (HRA) is an item that can help you the most, and many people use it
 
 
 iskar bachaane ke liye bahut-se naukareepesha log apane mata-pita ko kiraaya dekar us rakam par inakam tex main chhot hasil kar lete hai, lekin unhen kuch baton kaa dhyaan rakhana behad zaruri he
 
 
 In fact, under section 10 (13A) of the Income Tax Act, any salaried person gets 50% of his basic salary in HRA, the amount left under HRA or 10% of the basic salary from the actual rent paid
 The lowest amount is exempt from income tax, so many jobbers get exemption by giving rental receipts to their mother or father
 
 
 unke liye dhyaan rakhane vaali sabase zaruri baat yah he ki maa yaa pita ko bhi is kiraaye ko apni aay main dikhaakar is par tex dena zaruri he
 
 
 
 
 
 or usase bhi zaruri baat yah he ki jis makaan kaa kiraaya naukareepesha vyakti adaa karne kaa daawa kar rahaa he, vah usee ke naam nahin honi chahie
 
 
 The comments udhaaharan ke liye, yadi kisi vyakti ko 50,000 rupee mul vetan ke rup main praapt hote hai, or 25,000 rupee echaare ke mad main, or vah 25,000 rupee hi vastav main kiraaya detaa he, to use 20,000 rupee par hi chhot mil paaegi, kyonki chukaaye gaye kiraaye kii rakam main se mul vetan kaa 10 fisadi ghataane par yahi rakam bachati he
 
 
 But the thing to remember now is that the income of the mother or father who collected the rent will increase by Rs 20,000 monthly (even if their income is zero, now their income will be considered as Rs 20,000 monthly), and they will be paid income tax on this amount
 Will happen
 
 
 so, zaruri he ki ghar kiraaya dene vaale kii sampatti na ho, or maa yaa pita ko diya jane vaala kiraaya bank ke zariye diya jaae, or kiraaya vasuul karne vaala (maa yaa pita) kiraaye ke rup main hasil hone vaali us rakam par inakam tex adaa karen

 so, zaruri he ki ghar kiraaya dene vaale kii sampatti na ho, or maa yaa pita ko diya jane vaala kiraaya bank ke zariye diya jaae, or kiraaya vasuul karne vaala (maa yaa pita) kiraaye ke rup main hasil hone vaali us rakam par inakam tex adaa karen
 
 
 
 
 
 or usase bhi zaruri baat yah he ki jis makaan kaa kiraaya naukareepesha vyakti adaa karne kaa daawa kar rahaa he, vah usee ke naam nahin honi chahie

 so, zaruri he ki ghar kiraaya dene vaale kii sampatti na ho, or maa yaa pita ko diya jane vaala kiraaya bank ke zariye diya jaae, or kiraaya vasuul karne vaala (maa yaa pita) kiraaye ke rup main hasil hone vaali us rakam par inakam tex adaa karen
 
 
 For example, if a person receives Rs
 50,000 as basic salary, and Rs
 25,000 under the head of HRA, and he actually pays Rs
 25,000, then he will be able to get a rebate of Rs
 20,000 only because the repayment
 This amount is saved by deducting 10% of the basic salary from the amount of rental
 
 
 lekin ab yaad rakhane vaali baat yah he ki kiraaya vasuul karne vaale maa yaa pita kii aay 20,000 rupee masik bad jaaegi (yadi unki aay shunya he, to bhi ab unki aay 20,000 rupee masik maani jaaegi), or is rakam par unhen inakam tex dena hi hoga
 
 
 So, it is important that the house is not the property of the renter, and the rent paid to the mother or father should be given through the bank, and the rent collector (mother or father) will get income on the amount received as rent
 Pay tax 
 
 so, zaruri he ki ghar kiraaya dene vaale kii sampatti na ho, or maa yaa pita ko diya jane vaala kiraaya bank ke zariye diya jaae, or kiraaya vasuul karne vaala (maa yaa pita) kiraaye ke rup main hasil hone vaali us rakam par inakam tex adaa karen

 His major challenge is to at least maintain the 2009 election results
 chunavi safar ke dauraan raman kehete hai, ''main rajya kii sabhi 11 siton par congress se kadi takkar maanata hum
 Does not consider any election easy
 ”apni har sabha ke baad uriikhatole main ve kabhi chacha to kabhi sattu kaa ghol, bel kaa sharbat aadi kaa seven kar khud ko agali sabha main pasinaa bahaane ke liye khud ko taiyaar karte hai

 The campaign started from the Karyakarta Sammelan in all 11 seats, then the presence of the Chief Minister in the nomination of every candidate was enough to show how big a challenge for Raman, the bjp's general for Modi
 har seat kii baarikiyon par nigaah unhone har loksabhaa kshetra main kareeb aadha darjan se zyada sabhaayen kii hai

 Apart from the development and electoral facts, the note-sheet that Raman is studying before Korba reaches Barpali has been honestly written that the BJP candidate's inaction is the reason for the loss in the region
 lekin laabh ke mudde ke taur par modi kaa prabhaav hone kii baat likhi he
 Attack on the opponents with facts, Raman Barpali thunders in the scorching heat of two and a half hours
 ve kehete hai ki yah chunaav do tarah kaa itihaas rachane ja rahaa he
 First, the Congress is moving towards the biggest defeat and it will not be able to win more than 70 seats across the country
 doosraa, modi ke netritv main 272 seat jitkar bijepi kii sarkaar banegi
 Then he realizes the false dream of a monk in Daundiyakheda in UP and writes a letter to the Prime Minister, quips on the Mahant who digs, "the Mahant is seen sleeping in the night dream
 krishi mantri jaise bade pad par hai, lekin chhattisgarh kaa khet-khalihaan nahin dikhataa
 i had asked him, Mahant ji, if you have any other dreams, tell me
 ”bijepi ummidavaar ke liye apil ke baad ve isi loksabhaa kii darri kshetra ke liye udaan bharte hai
 Where did you get the Congress to get 70 seats? Smiling to this question of India Today, Raman says, "this is my personal assessment
 ” duusari sabha main unka bhaashan pehle jaisaa hi he, aakhri sabha se pehle helicopter main chaay kii chuskee lete hue raman apane khan-paan ke bare main bataate hai, ''main kabhi baahar kaa khaanaa nahin khaataa

 (chunaav prachaar ke dauraan) puure maheene main yahi khaanaa khaataa hum kyonki baahar kaa khaane se biimaar padane kaa andeshaa bana rahata he
 "raman's work, Modi's nomination, after Raman's tough attack on Congress candidate Charan Das Mahant from Korba, when Raman leaves for Janjgir Lok Sabha seat, smilingly tells heart," Today Mahanta's call will come —what did you say brother here (in Korba)? ”mahant and Raman's relationship is more family than political
 bijepi ke mishan-11 main sirf korba loksabhaa seat hi aisi thi jo bijepi ke haath se 2009 main phisal gai thi
 But this time Raman claims to win all seats
 ve kehete hai, ''modi kaa naam or chhattisgarh sarkaar kaa kaam, ye donon milakar ek or ek gyaarah banate hai
 We will definitely win all 11 seats this time
 ”vanshavaad kaa 'abhishek’chhattisgarh kii 11 loksabhaa siton par ummidavaaron kii kismat 24 april ke matdaan ke baad iviem main band ho chuki he
 But the second phase was also important for Raman from this point of view as he had to fight hard to get his son Abhishek Singh a ticket from Rajnandgaon Lok Sabha seat
 yah seat madhusudan yadav ne 2009 main 1
 It won by a margin of 19 lakh votes
 abhishek india today se sawaal karte hai, ''agar main rajnatik parivaar se hum to kya mujhe raajnneeti main aane kaa haq nahin he?bijepi ke ummidavaar chayan kii prakriya paardarshee or loktantric he
 My father never imposed personal interest in his political career
 ” lekin kya yah vanshavaad nahin he? raman kehete hai, ''vanshavaad kaa vishay bijepi main na he, na rahegaa
 Abhishek had been working as a worker for eight years
 rajanandgaanv kii janata or sanghathan ne usko aage badhaayaa he
 The "political 'salwa-juneoom' in Chhattisgarh against the Naxalites could not succeed
 lekin is chunaav main bijepi or congress ke bich kuch vaisaa hi gathbandhan hone kii dharna banati dikh rahi he

 He said, 'jinto's visit is a little different from Obama's visit to India

 That is why commercial diplomacy was important during Obama's visit to India

 People give donations on someone's request, you must have heard this, under pressure from someone, crores of rupees were given to an institution for help, you must have heard this too, but you will be surprised to hear the news that in Pune a senior citizen gave all his property and property to the army's relief fund, in the name of the country

 The Ministry of Defense was shocked after receiving Prakash Kelkar's email
 manohar parrikar ke personal assistant ne kelkar se kaha ki pehali baar aisa sun rahe hai ki desh kaa koi aadmi apni sari puunji desh ke liye laga rahaa he
 Lieutenant General DB Shektkar said that the amount of praise to Kelkar is as low as possible
 desh ko aise nagarikon kii jarurat he jo khud ke parivaar ke aage phogiyon ke parivaar ke bare main sochate hai

 Faced with terrorism, extremism and separatism, the Pakistani government has issued a fatwa against those who committed violence, including suicide bombings for religious purposes, with the signature of more than 1800 Islamic scholars

 Actually, the accused named Ayub was unilaterally in love with Fara living in the Welcome area
 shuukravaar ko achaanak ayub fara ke ghar main ghus gaya or usapar chaaku se tabadatod kai waar kar die jisase fara gambhir rup se ghayal ho gai or baad main aspataal main uski maut ho gai
 Ayub also escaped from the scene by injuring Fara's mother with a knife
 philhal police ne fara kii maa ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa he jahaan uski haalat abhi bhi gambhir bani hui he
 After the incident, the police started searching for accused Ayub

 The accused was angry with Fara for this and due to this resentment, he carried out the incident

 baat faqat itani he ki loktantr ke apratyaashit swabhaav kaa herold wilson se behatar varnan kisi ne nahin kiya he, ''raajnneeti main ek haftaa bahut lanbaa samay he
 "and remember, he said this in 1964, when a week was not really such a long time
 pichley hafte 48 ghanton ke dauraan thik yahi hua
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was first surprised by accepting the invitation of Christian institutions to speak at a ceremony organized for two recently ordained saintly priests, and let it be said that it was on the day of Maha Mahashivratri
 unhone is manch kaa chayan majbootee se vah baat kehane ke liye kiya, jo samvidhan kii kendriya prastaavna ko phir se dohraane se zyada kuch nahin he, jisaki raksha karne kii unhone shapath lee he
 Shortly thereafter, as if it was pre-planned and planned, RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat made a statement that Hindu women are not factories to produce children and thus rubbished the talk of BJP saffron MP Sakshi Maharaj
 sudhaar ke ye donon kadam pakke taur par soch-samajhakar uthaae gaye the, bhale hi ve dilli kii haar se prerit hokar uthaae gaye hon
 There was never any love between BJP and Muslims
 ve hameshaa use haraane ke liye ranneetik dhang se vot dete hai
 But now the RSS has opened up another new front with Christ
 dilli ke girjagharon main hui tod-phod ke peeche koi pattern ho yaa na ho, isane rajdhani main khaasi bechaini paidaa kii he
 Arvind Kejriwal took full advantage of it in his election campaign
 asal main, jab vah aap kii reliyon main hindu auraton se chaar bachche paidaa karne ke aahvaan kaa majaak udaate the, to hindu bahul ilaakon main bheed main se sabase tej hansi kii awaajen aati thim
 The improvement that Modi / RSS has made in its path is to accept the variations of India
 yah ek or baat kii bhi sweekaarokti he-rajdharm kaa takaza he ki shaasha ko saamaanya se hatakar bhi samaveshi hona, dikhnaa or mahasoos karnaa chahie
 Democracy does not just mean a majority in Parliament, it cannot ignore minority
 loktantr main chote-se-chote alpsankhyak kii bhi ek aawaaj hoti he or aap use chaahe jitna naapnsad karen, bahumat or bahusankhyak ke tamaam shor-sharabe ke upar use bhi sune jane kaa vishesh adhikaar hota he
 Now that Modi has extended his hand to Christians, it should be hoped that he will start a dialogue with our largest minority community as well, and resume the practice of the Prime Minister's annual iftar party this year, which last year was closed to imprudence i went
 loktantr main pratikatmakataa kaa mahatv hota he or yah hameshaa tushtikaran nahin hota
 If the symbolism had no value, then why would the Prime Minister wear a Sikh turban at a Punjab rally and wear a magnificent Naga hat, wings, bark and horn in remote Nagaland? Modi's late intervention and then one of his and Bhagwat's Two sharp sarcasm has almost allayed the fears of the minorities, however, this has led to a lot of loyal and often abusive supporters of the BJP on social media
 Ha have
 lekin agar is sudhaar ko apana taarkik makasad hasil karnaa he, to modi ko ek or alpsankhyak chunauti se-balki dohari alpsankhyak chunauti se-jujhna hoga, khaskar tab jab vah agle hafte apni sarkaar ke sabase mahatvapurn bajet satr kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 It is not just about the budget, the Parliament has to take decisions on a lot of the pending tasks of making laws
 hamane ise dohari alpsankhyak chunauti isliye kaha, kyonki loksabhaa main modi ko apni mukhya vipakshi partiyon, khaskar congress, ke prati rachanaatmak ravaiya rakhana hoga, phir sankhyabal main ve kitni hi choti kyon na hon
 On the other hand, he will need a fresh approach to tackle the challenge of being in the minority in the Rajya Sabha itself
 darasal, dilli ke jatke or bihar main pratikul lamabandi ne is anhakaar bhare bharose par shaq paidaa kar diya he ki jaise-jaise bade rajyon main chunaav honge, rajyasabha main bhi aahista-aahista bahumat tay he
 The more the Opposition's disdain in the Lok Sabha, the more it will have to suffer in the Upper House
 ve yah ravaiya rakhkar nahin chal sakate ki loksabhaa main to congress he hi nahin or rajyasabha kaa koi vajood nahin he
 It is too early to announce that the Modi government honeymoon is over
 unke paas ab bhi vakt he
 But like all other relationships, this relationship is going on in a normal fashion and their priority should be to minimize the negativity around it rather than just being a brawler
 unhen apane adhyadeshon ko manjuur karwaane ke liye sansad main talmail banaakar chalane kii jarurat he
 It would not be an ideal situation to get them forcibly passed by disregarding the Rajya Sabha and calling a joint session of Parliament
 iskaa matlab hoga kai nakaaratmak surkhiyaan, or shor-sharaaba or vipaksh (ab aap se or bhi majboot) ko sadakon par dharne-pradarshan or hadataalen karne kaa mauka dena
 He will have to go ahead and move towards the opposition as much as he feels the need to improve his party's relationship with religious minorities
 isliye sabase ahm sawaal yah he- kya modi ab sansad main bhi rachanaatmak talmail kii koshish ke liye taiyaar hai?agar modi eemaandaaree se vichaar karen, to unhone sansad ke saath apane rishte kii bilkul galat shuruyaat kii
 My colleague Ravish Tiwari, associate editor of India Today, tells me that you cannot ignore the fact that the first task of the Modi government was to issue an ordinance
 yah adhyadesh apane pramukh sachiv nripendra mishra kii niyukti ko vaidhata dene ke liye puraane kanoon main mahaj ek sanshodhan ke liye laayaa gaya tha
 Mishra has a gracious image and goodwill for all parties, so Parliament passed it without a single eye
 lekin isse unki sarkaar kii naakabiliyat nahin bhi to naatajurbekaari to ujagar ho hi gai
 Incidentally, at the same time, he refused to give the post of Leader of the Opposition
 ahm niyuktiyon (lokapal) ke maamle main bhi unhone ise sabase bade vipakshi dal ke netaa se badalane ke liye kanoon main sanshodhan karne ko tarjeeh di
 He was right in constitutional terms
 lekin naitik lihaaj se yah ahankaar se chur, niraadar karne vaala or rajnatik naadaani se bharaa kadam dikhaai diya
 Perhaps it was realized that the BJP would never be in the other side
 dilli vidhansabha main 70 main se teen siton kii ginati ne ek karaara jhatka diya he or sachaai kaa ehsaas karaayaa he
 However, by offering the post of Leader of Opposition to the opposition party of this three members, AAP has also completed dishonor
 bajet satr se ek ahm sawaal kaa jawaab milegaa: kya modi apana rukh badalane, naram padane or sansad ke saath saamanjasypurna or sahabhaagi rishte kii disha main kaam karne ko taiyaar hai, yaa unhone paanch saal kii laachaari or panguta ko niyati maanakar sweekaar kar liya he? agar duusari baat sahi he, to unki sarkaar or desh ke liye isse badtar kuch nahin ho saktaa
 Democracy means a system of controls and balances
 rajyon main jarur aisa hota he ki kai taqatvar mukhyamantri vidhansabha kaa saamana kiye bagaiyr chalate rahete hai
 At the center, you have to go ahead and talk, because the BJP leaders themselves often said from the opposition benches that the government is ultimately responsible for running the Parliament
 modi sarkaar ne shuruaati galatiyon ko or ulajhaa liya he
 He consulted with the states in June last year on amendments to the most contentious land acquisition law
 lekin sansad main vipakshi dalon ke saath baat nahin kii
 It was thought to be a contemptible thought
 beemaa kanoon main sanshodhan par bhi adhyadesh laane ke pehle ke chah maheenon main koi charchaa nahin kii gai
 Modi missed an entire session because he was not ready to accept the opposition's demand on some radical statements of his own party leaders
 jarurat itani thi ki vah sansad main aakar kuch vaisaa hi kah dete, jaisaa unhone carch ke aayojan main ab kaha he
 Regardless of the strength, the best way to run the Parliament is through participation and adjustment
 bahumat ek vardaan he, magar har siyaasi sawaal kaa aakhri jawaab nahin he
 There are also limits to the sheer number of 282 (in the Lok Sabha)
 1984 main rajeev gandhi ko mili 413 kii sankhya kii bhi simaaen thim
 Faqat started losing it only a year later with the Shahbano case
 1987 aate-aate to ve puri tarah ganvaa chuke the
 And remember, unlike the frantic, interconnected and digital era of today, the 1980s was a week long in politics
 vipaksh ke prati thodi-si vinamrata or udaartaa baratane se sarkaar choti nahin ho jaati
 a little praise from the UPA for the nuclear deal, a little softness on the issue of the Leader of the Opposition, treating the opposition with dignity in an all-party meeting will only help a lot

 Book: Iqbal: The Life of a Poet, Philosophy and Political Writer: Zafar Anjumprakash: Random House Language: English: Rs
 499 Siru Iqbal has a great name in Urdu poetry and this book is neither his first biography nor any such aspect of his life is mentioned in this book
 What people do not know before
 haa, ye digar baat he ki hindustan main log ikbaal ko bhuulane lage hai jisaki do vajahen ho sakati hai
 The first reason is that Iqbal's poetry is in a slightly difficult language and secondly that he used to write beyond romantic ie love
 yun bhi jivan kaa falsafa to aajkal sirf kitabon main simat ke rah gaya he
 Zafar Anjum has given priority to Iqbal's political life in this book
 ise padhane ke baad aap kuch der ke liye bhul jaaenge ki ikbaal wo shaayar the, jinhone 'saare jahaan se acha hindustaan hamaara', 'parinde kii fariyaad' or 'lab pe aati he dua banake tamanna meri' jaisi najmen likhin
 You would think that Iqbal was just an Islamic philosopher who strongly sought a separatist electorate after 1920 which we might call communal leadership and later demanded a separate Muslim country
 haa, ek khaas baat ye thi ki ye maang koi pehali baar ikbaal ne nahin kii thi
 Zafar Anjum, quoting Iqbal, says that leaders like Lala Lajpat Rai had also made similar suggestions in Iqbal long ago
 muslim lig main 1930 ke darmyaan ikbaal kaa kad bahut unchaa ho gaya tha kyonki usee daur main mohammad ali jinna england main rahaa karte the or mohammad ali johar kii maut 1931 main hone ke baad puri muslim lig ikbaal ke netritv main aa chuki thi
 On 29 December 1930, Iqbal addressed a gathering of the Muslim League in Allahabad, demanding the creation of a separate country by combining Punjab, Baluchistan and north-west Province
 ikbaal kii is maang ne bharat kaa itihaas hi badal daalaa
 However, Iqbal was doing separatist politics under the impression that the Congress leadership in India was under the influence of Hindu Mahasabha at that time and he believed that a separate Muslim nation was the only option
 ikbaal kaa wo bhaashan is kitaab kaa hissaa he
 He was also a barrister, but in the course of politics, practice did not do much
 raajnneeti se itar jafar anjum ne ikbaal ke saare videsh daure, unka cambridge uniwarsity jane kaa zikr bhi tafasil se kiya he
 The influence of the Persian and Sufi poets Jalaluddin Rumi and the German scholar Nietzsche can be clearly seen on the writings of Iqbal
 ikbaal samyawad se prerit the or unhone kaha tha ki agar samyawad main ishwar ko bhi shaamil kar liya jaae to yah islam ban jaataa he
 If he removes his political life, Iqbal becomes a Sufi poet who wrote, Shakti is also in the song of the devotees, the liberation of the people of the earth is in love
 unhone gayatri mantra kaa bhi urdu tarjuma kiya tha
 Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in Sialkot, in what is now Pakistani Punjab and at the age of 60, he left the world on 21 April 1938
 duniya ne unhe allamaa (jahin insaan) kaa khitaab diya, jisane 60 saal kii umr main hi sab hasil kar liya
 Reading Iqbal is very important for language
 padhie or jaaniye ki kaise sirf kalam kaa ek jaadugar puure desh kaa nayak ban jaataa he
 Iqbal should be read, because he is such a father who teaches the result of life
 dayaar-e-ishk main apana makaam paidaa karanya jamaana, nae subah-shaam paidaa kar The 15-member team of Team India has been contested for the World Cup 2015 and there are two names in the team, which is bound to be debated
 rabindra jadeja or stuart binni ke chayan se cricket pandit khaase naaraaz dikhaai de rahe hai
 After making three consecutive centuries in Ranji, such speculations were being made that Kiyuvraj Singh's team will return to India, although this did not happen
 chotil jadeja ko mauka kyon?olerounder rabindra jadeja kandhe kii chot ke chalate australia ke khilaaf maujuuda test siries main nahin khel rahe hai
 Jadeja is currently in Chennai and is recovering from his injury
 khabaren ai hai ki unhen abhi puri tarah feet hone main 10 se 15 din lagenge
 The World Cup is to begin on 14 February and India's first match is against Pakistan on 15 February
 rabindra ko world cap ke liye puri tarah se match practice bhi nahin mil paaegi
 He has been selected in the tri-series against Australia, England but it is difficult to say how many matches he will be able to play in this series
 chot kandhe kii he lihaaja unhen fielding karne main bhi mushkil ho sakati he
 It will also not be easy for Jadeja to throw
 ab is sthiti main unhen team main shaamil kiya janaa samaj se pare hai
 There are reports that Jadeja was selected in the team for the World Cup due to Dhoni's insistence
 lekin yah world cap he koi chota motaa turmament nahin ki captain kii jid ke chalate kisi khilaadi ko team main jagah mili
 Jadeja's fitness report was submitted to the BCCI only after his name was stamped
 ab ham to yahi manaayenge ki jadeja jald se jald puri tarah feet ho jaaen, lekin agar aisa nahin hota he to iskaa jimmedaar koun hoga?binni ko 'papa' ne dilaayaa tikat!stuart binni ko australia or newjiland main hone vaale world cap ke liye 15 sadasyeey team main shaamil kiya gaya he ab unhen team main pradarshan ke dam par to shaamil kiya nahin gaya
 Binny did not do any good on the tour of England nor did he hit any cannon in home matches
 phir bhi unhen team main rakhaa gaya, ab ise unke pitashri kii meharbaani nahin to kya kahenge? stuart binni ke pita roger binni bisisiai ke sellection panel kii paanch sadasyeey team main shaamil hai
 It is being said that he was included in the team at the behest of Roger Binny
 ab ek najar binni ke record par bhi daal hi lete hai
 Binny scored 13 in 6 odis
 33 kii ausat se mahaj 40 ran banaae hai vahiin 13
 There are 9 wickets at an average of 00
 ranjai ke is sijan main unka pradarshan ausat darje kaa rahaa he
 In such a situation, the logic of including him in the team is beyond comprehension
 chaar saal main ek baar aata he world cap or aise main sabhi selectors or captain ko team hit ke bare main sochna chahie
 Is this opportunity to run stubbornly and arbitrarily? The selector and captain must think that the shoulders of the entire nation are on their shoulders
 roger binni ne sellection ke baad kaha ki mujhe garv he ki meraa betaa world cap khelegaa
 So it is such a matter, Roger sir, that the misfortune of our country is that we cannot progress beyond familyism
 to aise main aapaki aane vaali saat pushtein khelti rahengi agar aap hi sellection kamity main bane rahe to
 
 
 Amid speculation about seeking a farewell match, Pakistan veteran all-rounder Shahid Afridi has said that he is experienced enough to make such a demand and also ruled out the possibility of retirement in the near future
 sanyas nahin lenge afridiafaridi ne aaj peshawar main media se kaha, ‘mainepakistanke liye 20 saal antarrashtriya cricket kheli he, pisibi ke liye nahin
 i am not dependent on anyone for the match
 jo pyaar or sahyog mujhe apane shubhachintakon or prashansakon se mila he vah mere liye paryaapt puraskaar he
 The aggressive all-rounder and former Pakistan captain said that he would not demand a farewell match from the PCB
 'board afridi ko shandaar vidaai degaa'afridi ne kaha ki bharat ne match khilne ke pakistan ke prastaav kaa kabhiskaratmakajawab nahin diya
 Senior PCB official Najam Sethi had clarified in an interview that he had no problem with Afridi and respected his services to Pakistan cricket
 unhone saath hi kaha tha ki samay aane par board afridi ko shandaar vidaai degaa
