 kohliislife) on Jan 2, 2018 at 5:40am PST After the 'aaj Tak' 'operation Rajya Sabha', where the Congress has become cautious in the matter of horse-trading, votes have been started in the Commission to postpone the election
 isi bich congress ne kathith taur par karnataka ke 14 nirdaleey vidhayakon ko mumbai bhej diya he
 The Election Officer on Monday sought an explanation from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on whether he had promised him an increase in the development fund in exchange for his vote
 mukhyamantri kochunaav ayogka yah sandesh tab aayaa he, jab vidhayakon ko ravivaar raat kathith rup se mumbai le jaaya gaya or vahaan panchasitara hotel main tehraaya
 Probably the reason for taking it there is that other parties should not make it to the court in the biennial elections on June 11 for the four seats of Rajya Sabha from the state
 jab is sambandh main poocha gaya to siddharamaiya ne kaha, 'main nahin jaanata, ve shaayad apane nijee kaam se gaye hon, main kaise jaanoonga?' is sawaal par ki kya congress vidhayak asti somshekhar bhi unke saath hai, unhone kaha, 'somshekhar unke saath kyon nahin ja sakate? ho saktaa he vah bhi mumbai gaye hon
 i don't know anything, nobody has talked to me
 'chunaav ayog main maathapaichunaav main matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne ke liye dhanabal ke badhate istemaal ko dekhte hue chunaav ayog ‘vot ke badale note’ ke aadhaar par chunaav radd karne kii taiyaari main he
 The EC can request the government to change the election law to get permission in this regard
 philhal samvidhan ke anuchhed 324 ke tahat ayog ko usee sthiti main chunaav radd karne yaa sthagit karne kaa adhikaar he, jab vot paane ke liye dhan ke istemaal se chunaav kaa maahaul bigadaa ho
 The EC Election Panel wants the government to amend the Representation of People Act to make the basis of the use of money for cancellation of elections
 jan pratinidhitiv kanoon ke ek praavdhaan ke mutabik, chunaav ayog ko keval tabhi chunaav radd karne ijaajat he, jab chunaav ke nattejey ko prabhavit karne ke liye baahubal kaa istemaal kiya gaya ho yaa booth capchar kiya gaya ho
 Preparing to write a letter to the Law Ministry, Commission officials said on Monday that it would be better if the provision to cancel the election on the basis of the use of money power is included in the law and the Commission does not have to exercise its constitutional authority for it
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki ayog is praavdhaan ko shaamil karne ke vaaste jan pratinidhitiv kanoon main badlaav ke liye aane vaale dinon main kanoon mantralay ko patr likh saktaa he
 Election schedule is not yet decided
 On May 27, the Election Commission recommended the Governor of Tamil Nadu to cancel the notification for holding elections in Arvakurichi and Thanjavur assembly constituencies
 aisa isliye kiya gaya ki is baat ke saboot mili the ki vahaan matadaataaon ko prabhavit karne ke liye badi maatra main dhanrashi upyog kii gai thi
 The state held assembly elections on 16 May and the AIADMK came to power for the second time

 It was Aurangzeb of the South who converted millions of people and demolished a large number of temples
 saal 2015 main aresas ke mukhpatr panchajnya main bhi tipu sultan kii jayanti ke virodh main tipu ko dakshin kaa aurangzeb bataaya gaya he, jisane jabaran lakhon logon kaa dharmantaran karaayaa
 700 hanged, conversion of millions
 Was this the identity of Tipu Sultan? In the 19th century, British Government official and author William Logan wrote in his book 'malabar Manual' how Tipu Sultan with his crew of 30,000 soldiers in Calicut There was devastation
 tipu sultan ne purushon or mahilaon ko saream faansee di or unke bacchon ko unheen ke gale main baandh par latakaaya gaya
 In this book, William has also accused Tipu Sultan of temple, church breaking and forced marriage
 yahaan 1964 main prakashit kitaab 'life of tipu sultan' main kaha gaya he ki sultan ne malabar kshetra main ek lakh se zyada hinduon or 70,000 se zyada isaayiyon ko muslim dharm apnaane ke liye majaboor kiya
 He is being accused from a communal point of view, but Tipu Sultan is called the world's first missileman
 bibisi ek report ke anusaar bharat ke missile kaarykram ke janak apije abdul kalam ne apni kitaab 'wings of fir' main likhaa he ki unhone nasa ke ek centre main tipu kii sena kii rocket vaali paintig dekhi thi
 In fact, Tipu and his father Hyder Ali frequently used rockets in the battle of domination in South India

 ' saamaanya varg ke logon ke liye aarakshan dene kaa faisla aasaan rajnatik faisla he
 P
 in 1991 ve
 Narasimha Rao also proposed a similar scheme with political implications, which the Supreme Court did not accept and therefore the bjp's latest proposal to provide 10 percent reservation to the economically backward general class people also supported those leaders of the opposition
 Found which are usually aggressive
 prastaav ke samay or iske lagu hone ke tareekon par kuch andeh jataae ja rahe hai, lekin koi bhi dal yaa uskaa netaa saamaanya varg ke logon ko aarakshan ke daayre main laane ke prayaason ko rokane kaa jokhim nahin uthayega
 For this, by amending the constitution, the Supreme Court's set of 50 percent limit on reservation will need to be increased to 60 percent, but the government would like to give at least the message before the general election that it is serious for the betterment of its main supporters
 Intends to do something policy wise
 chunavi rup se suvidhajanak ho yaa nahin par aarakshan badhaane ke is ascharyajanak prastaav ne haal ke dinon main kuch ladkadaati dikhi bhaajapa ko nai urja de di he
 In the recent assembly elections, the party's air of invincibility had evaporated, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where the margin of victory was small, it indicated that people were also starting to change the mood
 bhaajapa ke sutron ne ullaspurvak aarakshan ke is prastaav ko 'gemechenging' bataaya
 The reason for the recent election debacle was partly attributed to the resentment of upper caste voters who felt betrayed by the BJP because of the provision of immediate arrest under the SC-ST Act from the Supreme Court
 Overturned the decision to abolish
 adhinium anusuchit jatiyon or janajatiyon ke khilaaf hone vaale aparaadhon ke liye tatkaal giraftaar kaa praavdhaan karata he or court ne jaanch ke baad giraftaar kii vyavastha di thi
 How expensive the upper caste resentment was to the BJP can be understood from the fact that the number of votes cast for NOTA in 11 seats in Madhya Pradesh was more than the margin of defeat of BJP candidates
 aisa mana gaya ki bhaajapa se naaraaz uske kuch paramparaagat votaron ne gusse main congress ko vot karne ke bajaae nota ko vot dekar apana gussa darj karaayaa
 By winning those 11 seats, BJP could form government again in Madhya Pradesh
 aarakshan ke kathith chunavi phaayde bataate hai ki sarkaar kyon us puraane prastaav ko laane ke liye itani utsahit or sakriy he jise lagu karne ke pichley prayaas naakaam sabit hue hai
 The proposal which is still an idea recorded on paper, was described by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh as a 'historic step'
 unhone kaha ki bahut se logon ne iskaa vaada kiya yaa prayaas kiya lekin hamane ise 'kar dikhaaya he'
 But the question is, has the BJP really done this? Its decision will probably be in the court at the moment
 1992 main, sheersh adaalat ne faisla sunaaya tha ki keval garibi hi aarakshan dene kii ekmaatr anivaary shart nahin ho sakati he, garibi ke saath saamaajik or shaikshanik str par 'pichhadaapan' hone par hi aarakshan kaa laabh diya janaa chahie
 In addition, the government has raised eyebrows over the way it has defined 'economically weak' for this newly proposed reservation category
 uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar, adhikansh bhartiya (90 pratishat se adhik) aay 'krimi layer' main gine jane ke liye aavashyak 8 lakh rupye se kam kamaate hai
 Another cut-off is fixed at less than five acres
 zyaadaatar kisaan (85 fisadi se adhik) iske daayre main aa jaaenge
 Most of the Indians live in urban or rural houses of less than 1,000 square feet and the government has proposed for reservation that urban people living in houses of more than 1,000 feet area do not need assistance in form of reservation
 
 yani saaf he ki saamaanya varg se taalluk rakhane vaale badi sankhya main log ab aarakshan ke paatr honge
 The reservation scope has been fixed and if you are not suitable in that, then you can understand that you actually fall in the top five percent earning people of the country
 agar desh main vyaavhaarik rup se har koi us aarakshan kaa paatr ho jayega to kya phir bhi sarkaar yah daawa kar sakati he ki vah vastav main aarthik rup se kamjor hinduon, isaayiyon or musalamaanon kii madad kaa prayaas kar rahi he? lekin iske duusare paksh ko dekhen to sabko shaamil karne vaala yah sameekaran hi bhaajapa ko sabase zyada chunavi phayda pahunchayegaa
 No one can feel that he has been deprived of the benefits of reservation and this will leave the issue in Gujarat in the hands of Hardik Patel and others like him who demand reservation for communities which would not normally be eligible for it
 
 adhikansh aalochak sweekaar karte hai ki sarkaar ke is prastaav ko sabase kadi chunauti adaalat se milane vaali he
 This is where other such proposals collapsed
 vah sawaal phir se khadaa hota haih aarakshan darasal he kya or vah kiski madad ke liye he? sarkaar bhi in tathyon se waakif he or uski daleelein bhi kitni majboot hai yah court main pataa chalegaa
 *** kendriya mantrimandal ne apratyaksh kar kshetra main sudhaaron ko aage badhaane vaale vastu evam seva kar (jiesti) se jude samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak par buudhvaar ko apni sahmati kii muhar laga di
 This cleared the way for the Bill to be introduced in the current session of Parliament itself
 sutron ne kaha ki mantrimandal ne vidheyak ko der shaam manjuuri di or ise sansad ke maujuuda satr main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 The winter session ends on 23 December

 The amended constitution amendment bill was brought before the cabinet after concurrence between the Center and the states this week on other complex issues, including keeping petroleum products out of the purview of GST
 petroleum utpaadon par tex ko lekar prastaavit jiesti kareeb saat saal se atka hua tha
 GST will replace excise and service tax at the central level and VAT (value added tax) and local taxes levied in the states
 isse pehle, jiesti vidheyak ko 2011 main loksabhaa main pesh kiya gaya tha, lekin loksabhaa kaa kaarykaal samaapt hone ke saath hi vidheyak nirast ho gaya
 This has led to the new government bringing a new bill
 is saptaah kii shuruyaat main isko lekar centre tathaa rajyon main sahmati bani thi
 Under this, while the Center decided to keep petroleum out of GST, the states agreed to bring the entry fee under the new tax regime instead
 pichley saptaah teen daur kii baatcheet main rajyon ne is baat par jor diya tha ki muaavja vaale hisse ko samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak main shaamil kiya jaae
 Firstly in the 2006-07 budget, the then Finance Minister p Chidambaram had put forward the idea of GST
 shuru main ise 1 april, 2010 ko lagu kiya jane kaa prastaav tha
 People like us who have just started our career get very tense with such things (case filed for hurting muslim sentiments), i am happy with the order of Supreme Court
 Main sabko thank you kehna chahoongi support karne ke liye: # priyaprakashwarrier # oruadaarlovepic

 mahatma gandhi kii jindagi par kai behtareen kitaaben likhi gai hai
 In this episode, the new name 'gandhi India before' has been added
 'gandhi bharat se pehle' itihaaskaar ramchandra guha kii kitaab 'gandhi bifor india' kaa hindi anuwaad he
 This book written in English has been done by Sushant Jha, the best and simple Hindi translation
 aage padhie kitaab kaa ek aisa ansh, jiske jariye aap gandhi ji ke kuch anjaan doston ke bare main jaan sakenge
 The relationships that Mahatma Gandhi developed were not only personal but also useful
 unhen apane beton se, bhatijon se or apane bhartiya or europea doston se apaar sneh tha
 But more important to them was that these people helped in their social and political functioning
 wo unke akhbaar or unki vakaalat ke kaam main sahyog karte the
 He used to gather support for community welfare work
 saadhan hone par wo unki saarvajanik or saamaajik gatividhiyon ke liye aarthik madad karte the or wo unke saath jail jane ke liye bhi taiyaar rahete the
 These 'supporting' characters were important personalities in themselves
 ye vidwaan or samarpit log the or inhen ke jariye ham gandhi ke vyaktitv or aitihaasik charitra ko behatar tareeke se jaanate hai
 It is only through his relationships with Henry Pollock, Thambi Naidu, AM Kechalia, Sonjashlejin and Parsi Rustomji that we can properly evaluate Gandhi's political campaign
 harman kalenbakh ke saath unke prayogon kii vajah se hamen tolstoy or unke anuyaayi logon ke saath unke vaad-vivaad or aatm-sudhaar kii unki kaamana ke bare main pataa chalata he
 Through his conversations with Raichand Bhai, Joseph Doak and CF Andrews, we get to understand how Gandhi developed his understanding of religious plurality
 pranjivan mehta ke saath unki dosti or patrachaar ke jariye ham unke khudki mathrubhumi ke liye unke bade lakshyon ko samaj pate hai
 Through his relationships with Kasturba, Harilal and Manilal, we get a better understanding of Gandhi, whose failure in family relations stands side by side with her social and spiritual failure
 virodhiyon kii bhi ahm bhoomikajaisa ki saaf dikhataa he, ham gandhi ko unke dakshin africa main unke virodhiyon ke jariye bhi behatar tareeke se jaan pate hai
 Narrow-thinking Montford Cheminies, arrogant General Smuts, frenzied members of the East Rand and frenzied whites of Natal had shaped Gandhi's world and his thinking about the world
 isamen ugr pathaanon or durban ke irshyaalu sampadak pies ayyar kaa bhi yogadan tha
 Critics and enemies, like friends and admirers, turned a serious and naive lawyer who came to Durban in 1893 to a sharp, clever and conscious thinker agitator by the time he returned to India from Cape Town in 1914
 unke in virodhiyon main do sabase taqatvar log the dakshin africa main samrajya ke ek prashaasak (pro-counsal) alfred milanar or vidwaan or yoddha yaan chrishchiyan smats
 History has given Gandhi much higher status than Smuts and much higher than Milner
 lekin dakshin africa main gandhi ke bitaye dinon main ye donon unke mukaable kahin mahatvapurn hastiyaan thim
 Due to this inequality of status, both of them also looked at Gandhi's modest demands with neglect and insult
 agar inamen se koi bhi thodaa naram hota or bhartiya drushtikon kii parvaah karata to phir koun jaanata he ki gandhi ko lekar itihaas kaa faisla kya hota? yadi 1904 main milanar, transwaal main bhartiya kaarobaariyon ke tatkaaleen adhikaron ko kanoonee darja dene par raji ho jaataa to gandhi ke man main vatan-vaapasi tak savinay avagya kaa vichaar dur-dur tak nahin aata
 If after three years Smuts had withdrawn the Asiatic Act and agreed to the pre-war rights of about a thousand Indians, Gandhi would never have been able to know how long he would keep the morale of his supporters till his return to his country
 In 1903, the Daily Telegraph's Johannesburg correspondent wrote about Lord Milner's ban (he had set specific 'locales' for Indians to live)
 Received that it generates controversy just will not be limited to the Transvaal, but it will spread to England and India
 1907 main nataal marakari ne general smats kii jid ke bare main likhaa ki yahaan or bharat donon jagahon main iske anpekshit parinaam honge
 Both statements were about to tell the future
 yadi milanar yaa smats ne shuruyaat main hi gandhi ke saath samjhauta kar liya hota,to unhen kabhi bhi satyagrah kii takanic viksit karne kaa mauka nahin miltaa, naa hi is baat kaa vishwaas jagata ki yah bharat jaise vrihad or vibhajit desh main bhi kaam kar saktaa he
 In this case, the British imperialists and Boer racists gave Gandhi plenty of opportunity to emerge as a populist in South Africa and later in his motherland as well
 sapaat vaktaa the gandhidakshin africa main hi gandhi ne ek lekhak or sampadak ke taur par maharath hasil kii
 He started in England, where his colleagues gave him a free hand to open a journal
 nataal main apane shuruaati dinon main, unhone akhabaaron ko chitthiyaan or sarkaar ko dher saare aavedan likhe
 In 1903, he started his letter
 iskaa uddeshy dastaveji or raajnneetik tha
 This magazine was not meant to advance the interests of Gandhi, but for the interests of Indians in Natal and Transvaal
 gandhi ne iske liye gujarati or angreji main kai lekh likhe
 He kept an eye on its printing week after week and it was his main responsibility to raise money for it
 ek lekhak or sampadak ke taur par gandhi kii kushalta laajawab thi
 But as far as giving speeches is concerned, he was definitely a bad, if not a flat orator
 unke mitra or prashansak joseph doke ne likhaa ki ‘johannesburg main hi kai aise bhartiya the jo vaktaa ke taur par gandhi se kahin behatar, swaabhaavik or aprabhavit thi’
 Gandhi spoke softly and his speech was monotonous
 doke ne likhaa ki bhaashan dete samay ve kabhi bhi haav bhav kaa pradarshan yaa haath nahin laharaate the or ‘kabhi-kabhi hi apni ungliyaan hilaate the’
 But in spite of this the Indians used to listen to them carefully because even though the manner of speaking was monotonous, their words were strong
 gandhi ne apane lekh or bhaashanon se utane samarpit kaaryakarta nahin taiyaar kiye, jitne apni jeevanstyli or vyavhaar se kiye
 His restraint, his hard work, his courage was enough to attract people from different backgrounds
 chaahe wo muslim hon yaa yahudee, isai hon yaa tamil, vyapaaree hon yaa pheriwale or pujari hon yaa bandhua majdoor
 By influencing people from different backgrounds, he created a moral and then political community, whose members were happy to live poverty-ridden lives and go to jail under his leadership and guidelines
 gandhi ke prati unke doston kii patibaddhta sachmuch ascharyajanak thi
 He was always a 'big chieftain' for LW Rich
 polak ne gandhi ke prati sammaan kii vajah se apni patni or bacchon se dur hokar maheenon ek anjaan jagah main unke saath yaatr karnaa pasand kiya tha
 Thambi Naidu also used to take pleasure in putting his life at stake to repeatedly arrest and save Gandhi's life
 pike naidu jab bhi kaid se baahar aate, wo sabase pehle gandhi se milanaa pasand karte the
 The energetic Sonja Schlezin worked at Gandhi's office all day and still took time and energy to help Tamil women and deliver food to their husbands in jail, and Harman Kallenbach's loyalty was above all

 Sachin Tendulkar's last address at the Wankhede Stadium was full of emotions
 apane is sambodhan main sachin apane parivaar sahit aise kisi shaks yaa sanghathan ko dhanyavad karnaa nahin bhuule, jo kisi na kisi rup se unke kariyar se judaa rahaa ho
 During his address, Sachin himself also drifted into emotions and also swayed the people listening to him
 darasal, yah sachin se deshavaasiyon kaa pyaar bharaa lagaav hi tha, jisane unhen bhaawanaaon se otprot kar diya
 What will be the life ahead of this player, who has lived every moment for 24 years and one day for international cricket, cannot be said yet, but his wife Anjali made it clear that it is meaningless to explore the possibility of Sachin's life without cricket
 anjali ke mutabik sachin kaa janm hi cricket ke liye hua he
 Anjali's statement came true when Sachin said in the beginning of his address that his life of 24 years between 22 yards is coming to an end today, but he wants to remember all those people today
 Has contributed to reach them in one way or the other
 sachin kaha, mere pita mere liye prerana kaa sabase bada strot the
 He wanted to make me a good person and i always tried to be a good person
 aaj ke din main apane pita kii kami mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 My mother never knew what cricket was
 jahaan tak main samajhataa hum ki mere jaise bachche ko bada karne main unhen kaaphi papad belane pade honge, lekin maa har tarah se mere saath rahi
 Ma being a sportsman took care of my health and food
 dhanyavad maa
 Sachin said that his elder sister Savita was the first to gift him a bat
 vah apni bahan, unke parivaar, apane sabase bade bhai nitin or ajit ko dhanyavad dena chaahate hai
 According to Sachin, he had a dream of becoming a cricketer along with Ajit and Ajit contributed significantly in this
 iske baad sachin ne apni patni or bacchon ko dhanyavad diya
 In doing so, Sachin could not control his emotions and resorted to water to hide them
 anjali bhi apane ankhon se aansu ko nahin roak pain
 Sachin said, the happiest moment of my life came when i married Anjali
 anjali ne parivaar kii jimmedaari apane kandhon par lee or mujhe aaazaad kar diya desh or duniya ghumkar cricket khilne ke liye
 i understand that if Anjali were not there, my career would not have happened
 dhanyavad anjali
 Sachin said, my son Arjun is 16 and daughter Sara is 14 years old
 in donon ne umr ke is padaav par bahut kam hi meraa saath paaya he
 Whenever i did not attend parent meetings in school or could not help them in doing homework, they never complained about it
 dhanyavad sara or arjuna
 i promise you today that i will be with you all the time for 16 and 14 years to come
 iske baad sachin ne mumbai cricket sangh, bhartiya cricket control board, media (print electranik evam photographeron), chayankartaaon, physio, trainron or tamaam team sahyogiyon ko dhanyavad diya
 At the same time, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly were shown on the big screen of the stadium, then Sachin said that without his team and these three, he could not think of his career as such
 sachin ne kaha, rahul, saurav or lakshmana mere lambe samay ke saathi rahe hai
 Today Anil (kumble) is not here, but i have had a wonderful time with them all
 main itnaa kahana chahta hum ki ham sabko bharat ke liye khilne kaa mauka mila or hamen iske liye ishwar kaa dhanyavad karnaa chahie, kyonki ishwar ne hamen is khaas kaam ke liye chunaa he
 Sachin had so much to say that Rahul could not hide his feelings
 vah kaaphi ruaanse najar aa rahe the
 Ganguly and Laxman had the same situation
 iske baad sachin ne viraat kohli ke kandhe par baithkar bhartiya team ke apane saathiyon ke saath tirangaa haath main lekar maidan kaa chakkar lagaaya or phir hameshaa ke liye sakriy cricket se dur chale gaye
 It was the time of the end of an era
 ek aisa yug, jisamen sachin ne har ek kirtiman ko apana gulam or duniya bhar ke arabon logon ko apana mureed banaae rakhaa
 The story of this film won everyone's heart and it became a hit at the box office

 On the morning of 1 June, China took a major step to further increase its growing global economic impact
 usne apni mudra yuan ke japani mudra yen ke saath sidhe vyapaar kii ghoshnaa kii
 On this day in Mumbai, the Reserve Bank of India continued its hopeless attempt to hold the sinking rupee, but it achieved only modest success
 rupaya 31 may ke 56
 55 on June 1, falling at the rate of 10 rupees per dollar
 60 rupye prati dollar par pahunch gaya
 Even China has now come close to its goal of making the yuan a reliable international currency, but India's dream of becoming an economic superpower is still far away
 china-japan vyapaar sirf yuan or yen main niptaya jayega or iske liye america dollar kii jarurat nahin hogi
 This step will save the transaction costs of converting the currency of both countries to dollars
 pehle salanaa 300 arab dollar kaa 60 fisadi china-japan vyapaar america dollar main hota tha
 This will also promote trade and investment between the two countries
 china kii samachar agency shinhua ke mutabik ''yuan kii antarrashtriya bhoomika badhaane ke liye ek kadam or uthaaya gaya he
 "the US agency Bloomberg called it" another step toward China's efforts to increase global use of its currency and reduce its dependence on the dollar "
 china ne yah kadam sahi samay par uthaaya he
 The euro zone is in deep crisis and Japan has been stagnant for the past two decades, making the US dollar the only truly acceptable currency worldwide
 yaheen par ek vikalp ke liye jagah banati he
 China is in a much better position than India
 kisi desh kii mudra kii takat aakhirkaar uski arthvyavastha kii majbootee se tay hoti he
 China is the second largest economy in the world with a GDP of 7
 2 lakh karod (trillian) dollar he, bharat ke 1
 Almost four times against 7 trillion dollars
 yah kareeb 8 fisadi kii vruddhi dar ke saath duniya kii sabase teji se badhane vaali arthvyavastha bhi he, bharat kii 6 fisadi se bhi kam vruddhi dar ke mukaable kaaphi tej
 China's current account is in the surplus because it exports more than imports
 isse yuan ko takat milti he
 On the other hand, India is facing huge losses on the current account front
 isse rupye kii haalat or najuk ho jaati he
 Economist Bibek Debroy explains, "the dollar is not the world's reserve currency just because of its use in trade, it is also because people invest in the dollar in financial assets such as bonds and treasury bills
 
 china ne abhi apane vittiya bazaaron ko nahin kholaa he, is tarah se usne yuan ko sirf vyapaarik jaruraton ke liye simit rakhaa he
 Debroy feels that the yuan will become a global currency only after at least 20 years from now
 philhal china shaayad use kshetreey str par sweekaarya mudra banane kii simit mahatvakanksha hi rakhata he
 On the other hand, the rupee cannot even think of achieving regional currency status
 axis bank ke mukhya arthshaastri or senior vaais president saugat bhattacharya kehete hai, ''main yah kalpana hi nahin kar saktaa ki rupye ko madad ke rup main bharat waapas bhejne ke alaava japan uskaa koi or bhi istemaal kar saktaa he
 "the value of the rupee has dropped by 20 per cent since last year
" iske is record ko dekhte hue koi bhi apane videshi mudra bhandar main rupaya nahin rakhana chahega
 "it can take at least 40 years for the rupee to achieve global currency status," says Debroy
 yadi upie sarkaar lambey samay tak satta main rahi to isamen or samay lag saktaa he
 "the depreciation of the rupee in the last one year reflects the poor economic management of the government
" videshi niveshkon ne yah sanket diya he ki unhen philhal bhartiya arthvyavastha main bharosa nahin he
 The rupee has increased their anger
 july 2010 main sarkaar ne rupye ke liye ek pratik chinh sweekaar kiya tha
 It was then seen as the first step towards internationalization of the rupee
 iske baad se rupaya 20 fisadi girakar 46
 50 Rs
 se kareeb 55
 60 Rs
 prati dollar par pahunch gaya he
 In 2010, the government had a ready rupee ready, but now it does not seem to go anywhere

 According to the information received, Kanhaiya (5), a resident of Ishwar Colony of Bawana, was riding a bicycle
 cycle chalaate hue vah sinchai nahar ke paas pahunch gaya
 Suddenly Kanhaiya's balance was disturbed and he along with his bicycle fell into the canal

 dipanshu ne agle hi pal bina kuch soche-samajhe nahar ke upar se guzar rahe bijli ke patale pole ko cross kiya or usne ek badi si lakdi dhundhakar kanhaiya kii ore badhaai
 Thankfully Kanhaiya grabbed the wood and with the help of it he came out of the canal

 The two little friends have now become brothers

 spes yani antariksh
 But is there space? Where is it? How far from Earth or Earth
 antariksh kiski milakiyat he? antariksh par insaan kyo pahunchaa? antariksh main ghoomte satellite kya karte hai? kya duniya kii tarah antariksh par kabje ko lekar bhi jang ho sakati he? agar nahin antariksh main missile bhejne kii kya jarurat? ye tamaam sawaal aaj isliye kyonki bharat ne 27 march kii subuh prithvi se kareeb 300 kilometre oonchai par anti satellite missile se ek satellite ko maar giraaya he
 However, the satellite that was shot down was also its own
 to aaie aaj vaardaat main aapako prithvi se 100 kilometre oonchai par spes yani antariksh main liye chalate hai
 So after land and sky, India is safe in space too
 ab desh main koi napak satellite nahin ghus paaegi
 Now in space, India has also made 'surgical strike'
 duniya main jo bhi bade desh hai, unhone apane apane deshon ko jal, thal or vaayu ke alaava antariksh main bhi mahfuz kar rakhaa he
 Now India too has joined those select superpowers
 jinke paas upgrah rodhi missile system yani ASAT he
 Indian Space Agency DRDO has successfully test-fired the ASAT system in space and has penetrated 300 km into space and killed a live satellite
 haalanki iske aage jo kuch bhi raashtra ke naam sambodhan main piem modi ne kaha
 The truth is that most of the people didn't care
 magar pradhanmantri kii baton kaa labboluab ye tha ki ab antariksh se bhi desh ko khatra nahin he
 So before taking the matter further, it is important to understand that what is the anti satellite massile that PM Modi is talking about
 anti satellite missile khaastaur par sainya makasad se antariksh main satellites ko tabah karne main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This technique is called A-SAT system
 ye ek aisi missile hoti he jo hawa main gumti hui kisi bhi satellite ko aasaani se nishaanaa bana sakati he
 In a way, it is a weapon to show Jauhar in space
 abhi tak aisi takanic sirf america, china or rus ke paas thi
 But now India too has become a country equipped with A-SAT missile
 e-sat missile jang jaisi halaat main dushman kii kisi bhi satellite ko tabah kar saktaa he
 However, the world has not yet faced such situations
 jab is khaas hathiyaar kaa istemaal kiya gaya ho
 Different countries have killed their own satellite to show their humility in it
 in deshon main bharat se pehle america, rus or china shaamil hai
 India has also killed its own old satellite for this test
 aisa karne ke liye bhartiya vaigyanikon ko sirf 3 minute kaa vakt laga
 The satellite that was shot down was in the low-earth Orbit
 ab aapke zahan main sawaal uth rahaa hoga ki ye 'lo-arth orbit' kya hota he
 They will tell you but before that understand that different countries of the world send their satellites in space for different purposes
 jisase mobile, radio or tivi signal ko bheja or risive kiya jaataa he
 It is also used to monitor other countries
 ye satellite amuman lo-arth orbit main maujuud hoti hai
 Low Earth Earth orbit
 isko aise samajhie ki ye prithvi se 100 kimi se lekar 2 hajaar kilometre ke bich kii oonchai kaa aria he
 And when a satellite is established here, that is called the low-earth Orbit Area
 bharat ne missile se jis satellite ko nishaanaa banaaya wo missile se kareeb 300 kilometre kii duuri par thi
 The most interesting thing is that it was killed in a rotating state in the satellite orbit
 antariksh main aisi anokhi takat ko hasil karne waalon main shuruuaati koshish america or rus ne kii thi
 Because before that satellites were targeted with land-launched missiles
 lekin sabase pehle rus ne antariksh main satellite ko maar giraane kii takat kaa pradarshan kiya
 After which America too did this feat
 A-SAT system darasal ek tu stage missile hoti he
 Above which the MHV ie miniature homing vehicle is installed
 missile se alag hone ke baad ye emechavi satellite se sidhe takaraakar use nasht kar detaa he
 Friends, the other advantage of this will be that any missile coming towards the country can be knocked down before India can penetrate it into the air range of the country
 kul milakar bharat ko apane padosi mulkon se missile hamale kaa jo khatra bana rahata tha
 The scientists of this country have also removed it
 isliye ab antariksh main bhi bharat surakshit ho gaya he
 Former BJP leader Govindacharya believes that at present, the party lacks dialogue

 govindacharya ne kaha, 'koi bhi sanghathan khaskar vichaardhaara vaali party keval anushaasan se nahin, samvaad or vishwaas se hi chalati he
 i would say that for an organization to run well, it is important to give affection to the younger ones and respect the younger ones
 isamen kami hoti he to swaabhaavik taur par samasyaayein upajati hai

 ' He further said, 'it is also the job of the rest of the ideology family (ie RSS) to intervene if the matter is not resolved from inside

 kuch hafte pehle akshay kumaar kii film ‘toilet; ek premakatha’ ko simavarti jile kathua ke govindsar gaanv ke logon ko dikhaaya gaya
 This step was taken because the government was facing opposition from the villagers in their efforts to build toilets there
 somvaar 1 oktober ko sarkaar ne is ilaake ko kathua jile kii tarah hi ‘khule main shouch se mukt (ODF) kshetra ghoshit kiya
 Although most parts of the state of Jammu and Kashmir are being claimed as ODF, according to the government, 'revolutionary' work has been done in this direction on the International Border (IB)
 seemaa se sate ilaake ko pakistan kii golibari or golabari kaa saamana karnaa padataa rahata tha isliye 2014 main graminon ne fabricated toilets tatkaal muhaiyaa karaane kii maang kii thi
 These demands were made keeping in mind the safety of women and children
 is maang ke kareeb dhai saal baad ilaake ke kuch gaanvon main baio toilet dikhne shuru ho gaye
 This should have been good news for the villagers, but those for whom these toilets were built started opposing them
 bobiyaan gaanv ke sarpanch bharat bhushan sharma ne kaha, “toilets kaa istemaal sirf tabhi hota he jab seemaa par golibari ho rahi hoti he
 According to Sharma, six border villages fall under them and barely 10 per cent of the population uses toilets there
 sharma ne aisi sthiti ke liye sarkaar ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya
 Sharma said, "toilets are not much used on the border
 gramin adhiktar ashikshit hai
 Toilets are used only during firing at the border
 ”sarpanch ne kaha ki kshetra main jis tarah jaagrukta laai jaani chahie thi, vaise nahin laai gai
 For this, there should be large scale work
 sharma 40 gaanvon vaali seemaa kalyaan samiti kii aguai bhi karte hai
 According to Sharma, people who were financially strong had built toilets themselves
 lekin jo paise se kamjor the, unhone 12,000 rupye kii madad milane ke baad toilet banvaanaa shuru kiya
 It costs Rs 37,000 to build each community bio toilet
 ‘thri in van’ toilets se baio gas or baio fertilizer kaa utpaadan bhi hota he
 But an official admitted that we have made bio toilets but people have not yet been able to connect themselves to the concept of community toilet
 haalanki sarkaar kii ore se daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki kshetra ko ODF kiya ja chukaa he
 But the current situation may be different from this
 sarkari adhikariyon kaa daawa he ki is mishan ko lekar kamyaabi kii kai kahaniyaan saamne ai hai
 At the same time, all efforts are being made for necessary changes
 chakra gaanv ke sarpanch rakesh sharma kehete hai- “kuch toilet bane hai
 Wherever they are made, people are using them
 ”kathua ke dipti kamishnar (DC) rohit khajuriya kaa kahana he, “corporate soshal risponsibilti (CSR) ke tahat kai karporate companiyaan jaise ki indian oil, kol india, ONGC ne hamen 1400 privet toilets banane main madad kii he
 According to Khajuria, now efforts are being made to change the habit of people, late in the morning these people will start using these toilets

 Do you have any idea about the option of a huge institution like Planning Commission
 yahi ki amuk yojanaon par centre or rajyon ko milakar kitne paise kharch karne chahie? kisi rajya kii zarurat kaa paimaana kya ho, usamen kis tarah ke log hon, vikaas kaaryon ke moolyankan kaa paimaana kya he? If you are opinion on all these things then for you, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted on Tuesday morning, i am asking for your opinion on what should be the face of the new institution instead of the Planning Commission
 ham prastaavit sanstha ko aisa rup dena chaahate hai jo 21 veen sadi ke bharat kii aakankshaon ko puri kar sake or rajyon kii bhagidaari ko majboot kar sake
 For this the government www

 When we went to the site of My Governor, the column did not appear to give an opinion related to the design of the organization
 ho saktaa he bana nahin ho, par vahaan par aapse nai sanstha kaa naam pratik chinh yani logo or tagaline yani naaraa poocha gaya he
 From the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15 August, the Prime Minister said that the Planning Commission is no longer able to meet the needs of 21st century India
 apane samay kii zaruuraton ko puraa karne main iskaa acha yogadan rahaa hoga or uske prati aadar bhi he, lekin ab isaki zarurat nahin he kyonki bharat ke fedral strecchar kii ahmiyat pichley saath saalon main jitani thi, usase zyada aaj ke yug main he
 Our federal structure has to be strengthened
 mukhyamantri or pradhanmantri kii ek team kaa formation ho is kaam ko ab planning kamishan ke nae rang rup se sochna padegaa
 Sometimes the cost of repairing the old house is high, but there is no satisfaction
 phir man karata he ki ek nayaa hi ghar bana len
 Hence the direction of taking the nation forward with a creative thinking in place of the Planning Commission within a very short period of time, the direction of public-private partnership resources optimal utilization of natural resources, strengthening state governments, strengthening the federal structure, We will create a new institution with new body and new soul
 motaa moti khaakaa khinchne ke baad chaar din baad isi nai sanstha ke bare main piem ne aapse raay maangi he
 One can complain that the Planning Commission should be abolished but opinion is not sought, but such people can take satisfaction at the moment that opinion has been sought on what is new
 ab sawaal he ki pradhanmantri jin uddeshyon ko gina rahe hai, uski purti ke liye kya vaaki yojana ayog sakasham nahin hai
 Was the Commission a hindrance to center-state relations
 pradhanmantri narendra modi se pehle bhi kai vichaarak yojanakaar yojana ayog ko samaapt karne se lekar isamen badlaav kii vakaalat karte rahe hai
 In today's The Hindu newspaper, former Governor Gopal Gandhi has written an article that the notion of Planning Commission was conceived by Jawaharlal Nehru
 yojana ayog kii pariklpana netaji subhash chandra bose or ganitagya meghnad saaha kii dein he
 In the 1938 Haripura Congress, Subhash Chandra Bose said in his presidential speech that the first task in independent India to fight poverty should be to become the National Planning Commission
 jaankaron ne aisa kaha tha ki pradhanmantri nehru kii viraasat se mukt hona chaahate hai
 But the need of the Prime Minister has stated that the focus of the new institution should be on the same
 sangheey dhaanche kaa matlab centre or rajya sarkaron ke sambandhon se hota he
 Gopal Gandhi has further written that the Planning Commission has retained the soul of the federal structure
 yojana ayog kamazor or majboot rajya chote or bade rajyon ke bich yojana banane or centre kii raashi ko baantne main ek pul kaa kaam karata he
 This work was done till independence in the 60s, but there was a time when it was not free in the Congress government
 in sabake bich kai maukon par kai logon ne yojana ayog ko behatar tareeke se chalaakar centre or rajya sambandhon ko majboot kiya
 Also find new formulas
 yojana ayog ko samaapt kar dene se rajya sangheey bhaavana se dur ho jaaenge
 Which institution will now review the plans will self-criticize
 hona to yah chahie tha ki yojana ayog ko uske mul uddeshyon kii taraf le janaa chahie tha, magar faansee de di gai
 Gopal Gandhi also criticized the UPA governments for not allowing the Planning Commission's autonomy to be restored, but today Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said that P
 Chidambaram also kept talking about changes in its structure

 The Congress empowered the states to spend only ten percent of the Union Budget to stop the regional parties
 yojana ayog or paryaavaran mantralay ke bahaane gaiyr congressi rajyon ko pratadit kiya gaya
 The Chief Ministers had to go to the Planning Commission officials and listen to the lectures
 to ab kya ye sab nahin hoga
 The panchayats will not get money directly
 The Chief Minister will have the right to spend more than ten percent
 nai sanstha main salaah mashvire kii prakriya kya hogi? kya vitt mantralay yaa nai sanstha main mukhyamantri ko kisi afasar se nahin milanaa hoga ye sab sawaal hai

 party pravaktaa emje akbar ne kaha ki kejariwal ne didisie kii jis file ke bahaane sibiai chhapemari ko lekar jetali par nishaanaa saadhaa, us file main jetali kaa naam tak nahin he
 Akbar said, if you raise any finger on Jaitley, it will be a big mistake, because the truth is with him
 un par jo log iljaam laga rahe hai, ve yaa to gumraah kar rahe hai yaa phir jhooth bol rahe hai
 He said, the truth has come out
 report main jetali kaa naam nahin he
 There is no charge against him, no indication (of doing wrong)
 dilli ke mukhyamantri ko apane aaropon ko lekar jetali se maafee maangani chahie
 
 
 They should publicly apologize
 unhone ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, unhen (kejariwal ko) adaalat main apni galati sweekaar kerani chahie (jahaan jetali ne mukhyamantri or aap ke anya sadasyon ke khilaaf manahani kaa mukadmaa darj karaayaa he)
 He claimed that after the 'conspiracy' of the then Congress government, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office had investigated and found nothing against Jaitley, who is also the former head of the DDCA, when the 'congress' government was then
 ' He said that Kejriwal had attacked Jaitley in his press conference alleging that the CBI had raided the DDCA file
 akbar ne kaha, ab mukhyamantri khud hi funs gaye
 
 
 His own team has not received charges against Jaitley
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha ki 15 november kii report saarvajanik hone ke baad aap (kejariwal) yah kahkar sthiti se baahar nikalne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ki jaanch kaa makasad kisi kaa naam lene kaa nahin he
 He said, but the report has a name

 Akbar said, Jaitley made no mistake
 lekin meraa maananaa he ki kejariwal ne bahut badi galati kii
 BJP national spokesperson Shrikant Sharma, who was present at the press conference, attacked the Congress and said that the party cannot 'intimidate' the BJP and the Narendra Modi government by making such allegations
 udhar, aam aadmi party ne palatwaar karte hue kaha, agar bijepi ko itnaa hi vishwaas he ki vah (jetali) saaf hai to phir jaanch se kyon bhaag rahe hai
 AAP leader Ashutosh said that the Prime Minister has also said that Jaitley should follow the example of LK Advani, who left the post after allegations in the hawala case till he got a clean chit
 ashutosh ne kaha ki jetali ko aage badhkar desh ke samaksh udhaaharan pesh karnaa chahie
 Earlier, they rejected the committee's report, but now they consider it as a holy book
 tippaniyan Ashutosh claimed, the report also said that a commission of inquiry should be formed in the case
 bhandaphod karne vaale ek vyakti ne pehle hi dilli sarkaar ko satark kar diya tha ki uparajyapal ke madhyam se ayog kaa gathan roak diya jayega
 In a tweet, Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal said, "it is interesting to see how the media houses are looking anxious to prove Jaitley ji innocent
" jetali ji jaanch kaa saamana karne se kyon dar rahe hai? yah bijepi or 'aap' ke bich antar he
 AAP takes tough and quick steps on concrete evidence
 bijepi kaa bachaav karti he or jaanch se bhaagti he
 He said at a press conference, he (kejriwal) must admit his mistake in the court (where Jaitley has filed a defamation suit against the Chief Minister and other AAP members)
 unhone daawa kiya ki tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ke 'shadyantra' ke baad gambhir dhokhadhadi jaanch karyaalay ne jaanch kii thi or jetali ke khilaaf kuch nahin paaya tha, jo didisie ke purv pramukh bhi hai, jabaki tab 'congress kii sarkaar thi
 ' unhone kaha ki kejariwal ne apane samvaadadaata sammelan main jetali par yah aarope lagaate hue hamalaa kiya tha ki sibiai ne didisie file ke liye chhapemari kii thi
 Akbar said, now the Chief Minister got himself trapped
 
 
 unki apni team ne jetali ke khilaaf aarope nahin paaya he
 The BJP spokesperson said that after the November 15 report was made public, AAP (kejriwal) is trying to get out of the situation by saying that the purpose of the investigation is not to name anyone
 unhone kaha, lekin report main naam he
 
 
 You cannot run a government with spectacle
 vipaksh ne dilli or jila cricket association (didisie) main bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaakar sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit kii thi or kejariwal ne vivaad ko lekar centre sarkaar par joardaar prahaar kiya tha
 Jaitley was the head of the DDCA for nearly 13 years until 2013, while he was not involved in the day-to-day activities as found by SFIO and gave him a clean chit in the UPA regime
 akbar ne kaha, jetali ne koi galati nahin kii
 But i believe that Kejriwal made a big mistake
 samvaadadaata sammelan main maujuud bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne congress par prahaar karte hue kaha ki party bhaajapa or narendra modi sarkaar ko is tarah ke aarope lagaakar nahin 'daraa' sakati
 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party hit back, saying if the BJP is so confident that he (jaitley) is clean then why is he running away from the investigation
 'aap' netaa ashutosh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne bhi kaha he ki jetali ko laalkrishna adwani kaa udhaaharan apnaanaa chahie, jinhone clinit milane tak hawala maamle main aaropon ke baad pad chhod diya tha
 Ashutosh said that Jaitley should go ahead and set an example before the country
 isse pehle unhone samiti kii report ko khaarij kar diya tha, lekin ab ve ise pavitra pustak kii tarah maan rahe hai
 The comments ashutosh ne daawa kiya, report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki maamle main jaanch ayog kaa gathan hona chahie
 a busted person had already alerted the Delhi government that the formation of the commission through the Lt
 Governor would be stopped
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne twit karte hue kaha, yah dekhnaa dilachasp he ki kis tarah media gharaane jetali ji ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye vyagr dikh rahe hai
 Why is Jaitley afraid to face investigation? This is the difference between BJP and 'AAP'

 The BJP defends and runs away from the investigation
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal ne apane samvaadadaata sammelan main jetali par yah aarope lagaate hue hamalaa kiya tha ki sibiai ne didisie file ke liye chhapemari kii thi
 Akbar said, now the Chief Minister got himself trapped
 
 
 unki apni team ne jetali ke khilaaf aarope nahin paaya he
 The BJP spokesperson said that after the November 15 report was made public, AAP (kejriwal) is trying to get out of the situation by saying that the purpose of the investigation is not to name anyone
 unhone kaha, lekin report main naam he
 
 
 You cannot run a government with spectacle
 vipaksh ne dilli or jila cricket association (didisie) main bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaakar sheetakaaleen satr ke dauraan sansad kii kaarywahi baadhit kii thi or kejariwal ne vivaad ko lekar centre sarkaar par joardaar prahaar kiya tha
 Jaitley was the head of the DDCA for nearly 13 years until 2013, while he was not involved in the day-to-day activities as found by SFIO and gave him a clean chit in the UPA regime
 akbar ne kaha, jetali ne koi galati nahin kii
 But i believe that Kejriwal made a big mistake
 samvaadadaata sammelan main maujuud bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa shrikant sharma ne congress par prahaar karte hue kaha ki party bhaajapa or narendra modi sarkaar ko is tarah ke aarope lagaakar nahin 'daraa' sakati
 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party hit back, saying if the BJP is so confident that he (jaitley) is clean then why is he running away from the investigation
 'aap' netaa ashutosh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne bhi kaha he ki jetali ko laalkrishna adwani kaa udhaaharan apnaanaa chahie, jinhone clinit milane tak hawala maamle main aaropon ke baad pad chhod diya tha
 Ashutosh said that Jaitley should go ahead and set an example before the country
 isse pehle unhone samiti kii report ko khaarij kar diya tha, lekin ab ve ise pavitra pustak kii tarah maan rahe hai
 The comments ashutosh ne daawa kiya, report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki maamle main jaanch ayog kaa gathan hona chahie
 a busted person had already alerted the Delhi government that the formation of the commission through the Lt
 Governor would be stopped
 dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal ne twit karte hue kaha, yah dekhnaa dilachasp he ki kis tarah media gharaane jetali ji ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye vyagr dikh rahe hai
 Why is Jaitley afraid to face investigation? This is the difference between BJP and 'AAP'
 'aap' thos saakshyon par kade or twarit kadam uthaati he
 The BJP defends and runs away from the investigation
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha ki 15 november kii report saarvajanik hone ke baad aap (kejariwal) yah kahkar sthiti se baahar nikalne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ki jaanch kaa makasad kisi kaa naam lene kaa nahin he

 AAP leader Ashutosh said that the Prime Minister has also said that Jaitley should follow the example of LK Advani, who left the post after allegations in the hawala case till he got a clean chit
 ashutosh ne kaha ki jetali ko aage badhkar desh ke samaksh udhaaharan pesh karnaa chahie
 Earlier, they rejected the committee's report, but now they consider it as a holy book

 "papa dude, it's just like you have a cloth
 
 
 " collar vaali kameez pahante hi chhutanki thodi khush ho gai
 Hardly a full sleeved shirt could be buttoned
 kapadaa nayaa tha or sakht bhi
 Sarita somehow twisted and tightened the strictness, then went to the button
 ab tak vah hamaare kharide hue kapadon ko pahan rahi thi
 Grandmother-grandmother was wearing clothes met by friends
 un kapadon main tamaam logon kaa dulaar jhalkata tha
 Who gave it, grandmother and aunt
 papa yaar, yah mamma ne diya he
 Brought it from the shop
 juuta papa laayaa he
 His answer was filled with heart and someone was given a ride, he was satisfied
 paanch minute ke bheetar aise laga, jaise un tamaam palon par kisi ne pardaa daal diya ho
 For the first time in two and a half years, she was wearing clothes that had no emotional attachment, no relationship, which we did not bring
 ek laal rang ke bag ke saath do jodi kapade aa gaye the
 Black colored shoe too
 khilone kii tarah
 It seemed that now he will come out of the box and start walking without feet
 dhire-dhire chhutanki bhi un kapadon main khud ko anjaan kii tarah dekhne lagi
 His excitement began to be felt
 bich-bich main nae bane anmanepan ko bhuulakar khush bhi ho jaati thi
 "papa, there is a packet in the shirt
 
 
 " packet nahin, betaa pocket he
 "pocket
 
 
 " shart kii jeb main haath daalkar laga ki ab uske paas bhi kuch bharne ke liye he
 She was completely changed as soon as she wore gray trousers
 meri chhutanki aaj chhutanki kii tarah kyon nahin lag rahi thi
 The stubbornness of telling the story in conversation had vanished somewhere
 uski sarita didi bhi vaise hi hairaan ho rahi thi
 How much my sweetie has changed
 kaisaa to lag rahaa he bhaiya
 Chhutki remembers her grandmother to get over this strangerhood
 "papa yaar, chal na daadi ko laate hai
 "yes, okay, will bring it
 tum jaldi se taiyaar ho jaao
 Do you like it? hum
 I'm liking it
 jawaab itnaa halkaa ho gaya ki meraa man baari ho gaya
 Gradually Chhukni becomes a stranger to the same house that he owns
 shart-patalun or juute pahante hi uski swaabhaavik harakatein kahin gum ho gayi
 i kept trying to smile like everyday
 kuch sharaarat kar de
 Grabbing the edge of the couch and stood up as if she had left her childhood
 ek jodi kapade ne use itani tezi se badal diya
 i was recording his words with a video camera
 sarita or ganga bhi maayoos hone lageen
 How home will be deserted
 meraa baccha kaisaa to lag rahaa he bhaiya
 Ouch! chhutanki ko bhi samaj aa gaya tha
 Everyday eyes around him have changed somewhat
 rozaana kaa taar aaj kuch tutaa-sa he
 Sometimes she would stop on the pretext of pulling the sweater, sometimes on the pretext of putting her hand in the trouser pocket
 ghar ke bheetar kisi or kaa ghar aa gaya tha
 Just a new ritual
 nayaa anushaasan
 a wall began to form
 use acha bhi lag rahaa tha, lekin vah un kapadon main apnaapan khojati dikhi
 His jumps would stop like that in one stroke, i couldn't believe it
 isiilie mujhe vardi se chidh he
 Not only a child, a man also becomes like anyone
 pahante hi lagata he ki aapane kapade ko nahin, kisi or ko pahan liya he
 The orange-colored sweater faded all its colors
 lekin chhutanki thodi ustad bhi he
 Quickly came out of the door
 god main uthaaya hi tha ki sarita ne tok diya
 Brother, let's go
 kitna to acha lag rahaa he
 It goes on and on
 didi by, main ja rahi hum
 Ganga and Sarita's eyes were filled as soon as they said this
 lift tak pahunchaa to dekha ki donon ab bhi darvaaze par hai
 Now i too was so far away from them both that they could not see my eyes
 aise maukon par rokna mushkil ho jaataa he
 Quickly lifted Chutanki to the dock
 jor se chipku kar liya

 Dravid is currently the head of the National Cricket Academy
 madhya pradesh cricket sangh ke aaajeevan sadsy sanjeev gupta kii shikaayat par athiks officer ne dravid ko conflict of interest ke maamle main notice diya tha
 In his complaint, Gupta had said that Dravid is a director of NCA as well as a vice president in India Cements Group, which owns the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings

 Ganguly had said that the Conflict of Interest has become a new fashion in Indian cricket
 yah khabaron main rahanaa kaa tarika he
 If you are an Android phone user, then you must have realized that your phone has slipped a little less than a few months after buying the phone
 kehane kaa matlab yah he ki jab aap phone par ek app se duusare app par janaa chaahate hai yaa koi kaam kar home screen par lautnaa chaahate hai to yah pehle ke mukaable thodaa adhik samay letaa he
 Moreover, it is possible that your phone hangs many times
 baharhaal, agar aisa he to aapaki pareshaani ab zyada der tikne vaali nahin he, kyonki in 5 tips kaa istemaal kar aap apane smartphone ko pehle kii tarah 'smart' bana sakate hai-1
 Uninstall or disable apps that are not used, every phone has internal memory fixed
 ek baat ganth baandh len, aapke phone kii internal memory main jitna space hoga, aapkaa phone utana hi acha kaam karegaa
 It is possible that your phone has a lot of photos, music or apps, which is why your phone slaw is working
 aap chahen to apane photos, music or data ko phone se hataakar Dropbox yaa Google Drive cloud storage sarvice par store kar sakate hai
 Along with this, you can free the internal memory by uninstalling such apps which you do not use or reduce
 appsuninstall karne ke liye:phone ke Settings main jaakar Apps menu ko clic karen
 Select the app you want to uninstall and click uninstall
 haalanki phone main company ke dwaara purv se aise kai app hote hai jinhen uninstall nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 By disabling such apps, the phone can be saved from being slowned
 apps ko eksternal memory main seve karen:agar aapke liye saare apps jaruri hai or aap unhen uninstall nahin karnaa chaahate to aap apps ko eksternal memory main bhi seve kar sakate hai
 Even by doing this, the internal memory of the phone can be emptied
 apps ko eksternal memory main seve karne ke liye Settings main jaakar Apps menu ko clic karen
 Select the app you want to move and click on move to SD card
 2
 Clear the app cache Whenever you use the app or the Internet on the phone, the app and the browser store the details of the work and website in the memory of the phone
 aisa isliye ki jab agali baar aap usee website ko kholen yaa usee app kaa istemaal karen to vah pehle se seve jaankaree ke aadhaar par website yaa us kaam ko jaldi kar sake
 But this is also a problem, because after having more text data store, it makes the phone slow
 aise main ise niyamit rup se hataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 How to do it: Well, to clear the cache, every app can be cleared one by one in the Apps menu by going to the settings of the phone, but it is like a mess
 behatar hoga agar aap google play par App Cache Cleaner, Clean Master yaa AVG tune up jaise free app downlod kar aasaani se bas ek clic main cache clear karen
 If you are using a smartphone now, then a little 'smart' has to be made

 Use fewer widgets and say no to live wallpapers
 Many people can argue that widgets make it easier to work on smartphones, because it only works by opening the widgets on the homescreen instead of opening the app
 yah sahi bhi he, lekin ve yah nahin bataate ki widgets khaskar facebook jaise widgets aapke phone ko slo banane ke saath hi phone ke bydaree byaap ko bhi prabhavit karte hai
 So it is better if you reduce the use of widgets
 gairajaruri widgets ko hataane ke liye homescreen par use 3-5 second tak press karen or phir phone screen ke upree bhaag main remove section tak draig karen
 Live wallpapers also play a big role in making the phone slow
 widgets kii tarah yah bhi bydaree byaap par nakaaratmak prabhaav daalate hai, isliye live wallpaper ko naa kahana hi aapke phone kii sehat ke liye behatar rahegaa

 anemation ko disable karengali jaankaree phone ke advanced setting ke bare main he
 Before giving this information, it is necessary to tell that tampering with it only when you are aware of what you are doing

 How to: Go to the Settings of the phone and click on Developer options, then go to the Drawing option below
 yahaan Window animation scale, Transition animation scale or Animator duration scale ko off kar den
 5
 software apadet karte rahenham main se bahut se log yah maanate hai ki ek baar phone kharid liya, bas ab koi apadet karne kii jarurat nahin he
 But many times it is necessary for you, because from time to time, the phone or app company sends its updates which solve the old problems
 masalan, aap koi app istemaal kar rahe hai or aapako usamen koi samasya aa rahi he to sambhav he ki us app ke apadet varjan main company ne us samasya kaa hal nikaal liya ho
 This will not only be a solution to your problem, but it will also benefit the processing of the phone which is getting slow

 Launch of Chandrayaan-2, the second moon mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), 56 from launch
 24 minute pehle roak di gai
 Chandrayaan-2 in the early hours of 15 July 2
 51 baje desh ke sabase taqatvar bahubali rocket GSLV-MK3 se launch kiya janaa tha lekin 56
 Countdown stopped 24 minutes ago
 tatkaal isro vaigyanik ye pataa karne kii koshish main jute gaye ki launch se thik pehle ye takneekee kami kahaan se ai
 ISRO spokesperson BR Guruprasad, while making a statement on behalf of ISRO, said that the launch has been halted due to a flaw in the GSLV-MK3 launch vehicle (rocket)
 lonching kii agali taarikh jald hi ghoshit kii jaaegi
 56 from launch
 24 minute pehle isro ne media centre or visitor gailaree main live screening roak di
 The launch process was halted on seeing the technical flaw
 is rukaawat kii vajah se isro vaigyanikon kii 11 saal kii mehnat ko chota sa jhatka laga he
 However, finding this technical deficiency at the last minute by ISRO scientists is a big step
 agar is kami ke saath rocket chhutata to bada haadasa ho saktaa tha
 It is the mastery of scientists that they have discovered a mistake
 a technical snag was observed in launch vehicle system at 1 hour before the launch
 As a measure of abundant precaution, # Chandrayaan2launch has been called off for today
 Revised launch date will be announced later
 - ISRO (@isro) July 14, 2019 What kind of reward? The government cut the payroll of ISRO scientists before Chandrayaan-2 was the reason for halting the launch of Chandrayaan-2 56 minutes earlier
according to reliable sources of ISRO, the countdown was in the last phase of the launch
 kuch minute pehle hi cryogenic ingine main liquid hydrogen bharaa gaya tha
 The part connecting the cryogenic engine and the Chandrayaan-2 is called the launch vehicle
 isro ke sutron ne bataaya ki is hisse main hi pressure licage tha
 It was not stabilizing at the fixed limits
 launch ke liye jitna pressure hona chahie vah nahin tha
 It was continuously decreasing
 isliye is isro ke moon mishan chandrayan-2 kii lonching ko taal diya gaya
 Will there be a human settlement on the moon? What is expected from Chandrayaan-2 The launch of GSAT-11 last year and GSLV-D5 was also postponed in 2013 before GSAT-11 was to be sent in march-april last year but postponed after GSAT-6A mission failed Gone
 29 march ko ravaanaa jisat-6e se signal los kii vajah electrical circuit main gadabadi ho gai thi
 It was feared that the same problem might come up in GSAT-11, hence its launching was stopped
 iske baad kai test kiye gaye or paaya gaya ki saare system thik hai
 Then it was launched on 5 December 2018
 us samay bhi isro ko jaanch sambandhi sari prakriya puri karne main kaaphi samay laga tha
 In 2013, ISRO also postponed the launch of GSLV D-5 rocket due to fuel leakage
 tab isro ke tatkaaleen chairman ke radhakrishnan ne yah ghoshnaa kii thi
 He had said that due to fuel leakage, we are postponing the launch of GSLV D-5
 ab ham rocket ko assembly building le jaaenge
 Will assess the data
 eendhan risaav ke kaaran kaa pataa lagaayenge
 Even then the launch was halted 74 minutes before the scheduled time
 2 minute main jaane- kaise joda gaya chandrayan 2 kaa bahubali rocket, dekhen videoisaro ke liye kyon ahm he chandrayan-2 mishan, paanch bade kaaran1
 Demonstrating Scientific Efficiency - When Russia refused, ISRO scientists created the lander-rovernovember 2007 in which Russian space agency Rosskosmos said it would work together in the project
 vah isro ko lander degaa
 In 2008, the mission received approval from the government
 2009 main chandrayan-2 kaa dizin taiyaar kar liya gaya
 The launch was scheduled in January 2013, but the Russian space agency rosscosmos lander could not deliver
 isro ne chandrayan-2 kii lonching march 2018 tay kii
 But for some tests, the launch was postponed to April 2018 and then to October 2018
 is bich, june 2018 main isro ne faisla liya ki kuch badlaav karke chandrayan-2 kii lonching janvari 2019 main kii jaaegi
 Then the launch date was extended to February 2019
 april 2019 main bhi lonching kii khabar ai thi
 It will be clear from the success of this mission that our scientists are not in love with anyone
 ve koi bhi mishan puraa kar sakate hai

 isro kaa chota sa kadam, bharat kii chhavi banane kii lambii chalaantpane duusare moon mishan chandrayan-2 ke saath ISRO antariksh vigyaan kii duniya main ho saktaa he ki chota kadam rakh rahaa ho, lekin yah bharat kii chhavi banane ke liye ek lambii chalaang sabit ho sakati he
 Because so far only three countries of the world have been able to get a soft landing on the moon
 ye desh hai - america, rus or china
 When ISRO launches Chandrayaan-2 on the moon, it will become the fourth country to achieve this mastery
 sarhad ke sipaahi se khet ke kisaan tak, kaise sabake liye madadgaar he ISRO3
 Selection of difficult place: Choose the place on the moon where no country has reached yet, according to Isro, Chandrayaan 2 will land in the South Pole region of the moon where no country has reached yet
 iskaa makasad, chandramaa kii jaankaree jutanaa he
 Making discoveries that will benefit India as well as the entire humanity
 in pareekshanon or anubhavon ke aadhaar par hi bhavi chandra abhiyaanon kii taiyaari main jaruri bade badlaav honge
 So that it will help in creating and deciding the new technology of future lunar missions

 The most powerful rocket GSLV mk-iii is in use GSLV mk-iii is India's most powerful launcher so far in Chandrayaan-2 mission
 ise puri tarah se desh main hi banaaya gaya he
 This three-stage rocket can carry a 4 thousand kg satellite in Geosynchronous Orbit at altitudes ranging from 35,786 km to 42,164 km
 yaa phir, 10 hajaar kilo ke upgrah ko 160 se 2000 kimi kii lo arth orbit main panhucha saktaa he
 Through this rocket, GSAT-19 has been launched successfully on 5 June 2017 and GSAT-29 on 14 November 2018
 wo 11 bade maukey jab ISRO ne apni takat se puri duniya ko hairaan kar diya5
 What will isro's Chandrayaan-2 find on the moon, which will surprise the world, and check whether the earthquake on the moon will occur at the same place where the land of Vikram Dekandrayan-2 will land
 vahaan thermal or lunar dencity kitni he
 The rover will chemically examine the lunar surface
 taapmaana or vaataavaran main aadrata (humidity) he ki nahin
 The evidence of water on the lunar surface was discovered by Chandrayaan 1, but from Chandrayaan 2 it can be found that how much of the lunar surface and the subsurface has water

 modi sarkaar ne may 2014 main kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad pradhanmantri modi ne 15 agast 2014 ko laal kile se yojana ayog ko khatm karte hue uski jagah nai sanstha niti ayog kaa nirmaan karne kaa elaan kiya
 Now once again the Modi government is reaching the ramparts of the Red Fort and this is the last Independence Day of its current term
 modi sarkaar se pehle kai dashak tak yojana ayog ne desh main kendra-rajya sambandhon kii neenv rakhi or desh ke vikaas kaa dhaancha taiyaar kiya
 But in the elections, Prime Minister Modi asked the country for just 60 months of government compared to the 60 years given to the Congress and claimed that through this new institution, he will show the work done in just 60 months, which the Congress government has made a huge system like Planning Commission
 Despite it has not done in 60 years
 lihaaja, ab jab modi sarkaar kaa laal kile se aakhri bhaashan dene ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi khadey honge to kya vah niti ayog kii uplabdhiyon or chunautiyon par kuch kahenge?ise padhein: laal kile se modi sarkaar kaa aakhri bhaashan, jaane puraane vaadon kaa kya hua?independence de 2014 ke maukey par jahaan kendra sarkaar yojana ayog ko khatm karne or uski jagah niti ayog ko khadaa karne kii baat kahi vahiin 1 janvari 2015 ko kendriya cabinet ke ek faisle se neshnal institute for transforming india (NITI) ko sthapit kiya
 To formulate new policies for the country, the NITI Aayog set out three important objectives - Digital India, Cooperative Federalism and bringing women into the mainstream of development
 arthath 'niti ayog kaa uddeshy he aise sudrudh rajyon kaa nirmaan karnaa jo aapas main ekajute hokar ek sudrudh bharat kaa nirmaan karen
 Knowledge systems of the states and the Center should be developed
 1
 Digital India - The central government took a big step in the direction of Digital India to eliminate corruption from the game of development on the Internet
 kaledhan par lagaam lagane or deshbhar main cashles tranjaction ko badhaava dene ke uddeshy se modi sarkaar ne 8 november 2016 ko notebandi kaa elaan karte hue arthvyavastha main sarvaadhik sanchalit 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency ko pratibandhit kar diya
 The central government launched the Bhima Aadhaar platform to promote cashless economy, which was intended to encourage small businessmen to undertake cashless transactions in the country
 in koshishon ke chalate kendra sarkaar ne april 2017 tak 75 shaharon ko kam cash istemaal ke liye chinhit kiya
 Read this: These are the issues of the common man, will there be a place in Modi's Independence Day speech? Most economists of the country and the world claimed to benefit from demonetisation in the long term
 lekin maujuuda samay main yadi arthvyavastha main cash ke sanchaar or sanchaalan ko dekha jaae to saaf he ki ek baar phir karency kaa dabadabaa bazaar main kaayam he
 Before the demonetisation, the daily work for which the cash transaction was most convenient to the common man, now the cash has once again reached that role
 lihaaja, kya 2019 main laal kile se bataaya jayega ki jin 75 shaharon ko cashles shahar kii disha main le jane kii kavayad niti ayog ne kii unka kya hua?2
 Cooperative Federalism - The dream of Team India was the effort of the government to build strong states in the country
 iske liye kendra sarkaar ne puure desh ko ek kaaman market banane kii disha main jiesti bill ko paarit karaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 The Central Government succeeded in building consensus across the country on the issue of GST and in July 2017 this new tax system was implemented in the entire country
 niti ayog ne is safalataa kaa shrey desh main kooparative federlism ko diya or daawa kiya ki kendra sarkaar ne aisa maahaul taiyaar kiya he jisase kendra-rajya sambandh apane sabase behatar swaroop main kaam kar rahaa he
 Hence, it was also claimed that GST would give the country's economy a chance to grow at a faster pace
 vahiin rajyon ke paas adhik sansaadhan hone ke saath-saath vah tej gati se apana vikaas karne main sakasham honge
 The government and non-governmental economic experts also claimed that after GST is fully effective in the entire country, the task of taking the country to double digit growth rate will become easier, while many states will take one to two years of GST implementation in this category
 Will arrive in ise padhein: kya chunaav par focus hoga is baar red fort se piem modi kaa bhaashan?lihaaja, kya laal kile se modi sarkaar yah bhi bataaegi ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad ek saal main niti ayog kaa lakshya kis had sahi sabit hua he or aane vaale dinon main kya ise puri tarah sach hote dekha jayega?3
 What did women get? The central government started several important schemes during the last four years on the directions of NITI Aayog
 in yojanaon se uski koshish deshbhar main mahilaon ko shashakt karne kii thi
 The most important of these schemes was to provide LPG under the Ujjwala scheme for clean and safe cooking to women in rural areas by the central government
 vahiin modi sarkaar ne jandhan skim ke tahat mahilaon ko banking kii mukhyadhara se jodne kaa kaam kiya
 At the same time, a draft has been put in front of registration of most houses to be allotted under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in the name of women
 ant main mahilaon ko kendra main rakhte hue modi sarkaar ne mudra yojana ke tahat mahilaon ko kaarobaari karj dene kaa bidaa uthaaya
 Will the Modi government make a statement on the steps taken by NITI Aayog in its last speech from Red Fort
 kya niti ayog kii mahilaon ko vikaas main laane kii mukhyadhara main laane kii koshish vaaki koi aisa kaam kar rahi he jisase kaha ja sake ki nai sanstha ne vah kaam 60 maheenon main kar dikhaaya jise purv kii sarkaron ne 60 varshon tak karne main asafalataa pai he?

 The point was that his swing bowling kept the Pakistani batsmen in the match

 main khud bhi laal batti kaa istemaal nahin karata hum
 i was a minister, stayed in the Rajya Sabha, but i never put a red light on myself

 Some man put 50 red lights on the roof of his car

 ek samay bhagwaan vishnu mrityulok main vicharan karne ke liye aa rahe the, lakshmi ji ne bhi saath chalane kaa aagrah kiya
 Vishnu said- 'if i agree with what i say, then come on
 'lakshmi ji ne sweekaar kiya aurabhagwan vishnu, lakshmi jisahit bhumandal par aae
 After some time, Lord Vishnu at one place said to Laxmi - 'until i come, you stay here
 main dakshin disha kii ore ja rahaa hum, tum udhar mat dekhnaa
 'paralakshmi ji proclaimed to Vishnuji that what happened in the south direction is forbidden to me and why God himself went to the south, there is definitely a mystery
 lakshmi ji se rahaa na gaya, jaise hi bhagwaan ne raah pakadi, vaise hi maa lakshmi bhi peeche-peeche chal padin
 a mustard field appeared a short distance away
 vah khub khilaa hua or lahalha rahaa tha
 She went there only
 sarson kii shobhaa se ve mugdh ho gayi or uske phool todakar apana shringaar kiya or aage chalin
 Next to the sugarcane (reed) field stood
 lakshmi ji ne chaar ganne liye or ras chusane lageen
 At that moment Vishnu ji came and seeing this, angry at Laxmi ji and cursed - 'I did not forbid you to come here, but you did not listen and she committed the crime of stealing the farmer
 ab tum us kisaan kii 12 varsh tak is aparaadh kii sajaa ke rup main seva karo
 Saying this, God left them and went to Rakshi Sagar
 lakshmi kisaan ke ghar rahane lageen
 That farmer was very poor
 lakshmi ne kisaan kii patni se kaha ki tum snaan kar pehle is meri banaai devi lakshmi kaa pujan karo, phir rasoi bananaa, tum jo maangogi milegaa
 The farmer's wife did as per Lakshmi's orders
 puja ke prabhaav auralakshmi kii kripaase kisaan kaa ghar duusare hi din se ann, dhan, ratna, swarna aadi se bhar gaya or lakshmi se jagamag hone laga
 Lakshmi completed the farmer with money
 kisaan ke 12 varsh bade anand se cat gaye
 After 12 years, Lakshmiji agreed to go
 vishnuji, lakshmiko lene aae to kisaan ne unhen bhejne se inkaar kar diya
 Lakshmi too was not ready to go from there without the wishes of the farmer
 tab vishnuji ne ek chaturaai kii
 On the day Vishnuji came to take Lakshmi, the day was Varuni festival
 isliye kisaan ko vaaruni parv kaa mahatv samajhaate hue bhagwaan ne kaha ki tum parivaar sahit ganga main jaakar snaan karo or in kodiyon ko bhi jal main chhod dena
 i will not take you till you return
 lakshmi ne kisaan ko chaar kodiyaan ganga ke dene ko di
 The farmer did the same
 vah sapariwaar ganga snaan karne ke liye chalaa
 As soon as he dumped the clamshells into the Ganges, four hands came out of the Ganges and took the reins
 tab kisaan ko aashcharya hua ki vah to koi devi he
 Then the farmer asked Gangaji, 'O mother! Whose are these four arms? ' Gangaji said, 'O farmer! Those four hands were all mine
 tuune jo kodiyaan bhent di hai, ve kiski di hui hai?'kisaan ne kaha- 'mere ghar jo stri ai he, unhone hi di hai
 On this, Gangaji said that the woman who has come to your house is Sakshata Lakshmi and the man is Lord Vishnu
 tum lakshmi ko jane mat dena, nahin to pun: nirdhan ho j xxrep 4 a ge
 Hearing this, the farmer returned home
 vahaan lakshmi or vishnu bhagwaan jane ko taiyaar baithe the
 The farmer grabbed Laxmiji's lap and said that i will not let you go
 tab bhagwaan ne kisaan se kaha ki inhen koun jane detaa he, par ye to chanchala hai
 Could not stop anywhere, could not stop them very big
 inako meraa shaap tha, jo ki 12 varsh se tumhaari seva kar rahi thim
 Your 12 years of service have been completed
 kisaan hathpurvak bolaa ki nahin ab main lakshmi ko nahin jane duungaa
 Take any other woman from here
 tab lakshmi ne kaha - he kisaan! tum mujhe rokna chaahate ho to jo main kahuun jaisaa karo
 Tomorrow is thirteen, i will celebrate Dhanteras for you
 tum kal ghar ko lip-potkar, svachh karnaa
 Keep a lamp of ghee in the night and worship me in the evening and keep the money in a copper vase for me, i will reside in that vase
 kintu puja ke samay main tumhen dikhaai nahin duungi
 i will not leave your house for the whole year by worshiping this day
 mujhe rakhana he to isi tarah prativarsh meri puja karnaa
 Having said this, they spread in ten directions with the light of lamps and God remained in sight
 agle din kisaan nelakshmijike kathanusaar pujan kiya
 His house was full of money
 isi bhaanti vah har varsh teras ke din lakshmi kii puja karne laga
 Yogi Adityanath, the surveyor of the Hindu Yuva Vahini Sena, has now become the general of the state
 yogi ke rajyog par is sena kaa hausala saatven aasmaan par he
 But the question is, what is the importance of this army left for Yogi himself, even though he has been sitting on the highest political post of UP
 sawaal he hindu yuva vahini kaa bhavishya kya he?samarthakon kii siyaasi bhakthi or isi sanghathan kii takat se yogi adityanath kaa kad gokhpur main lagaataar badhata rahaa he or wo paanch chunaavon se aparaajey bane rahe
 Just know how much this organization played in setting Yogi to the pinnacle of success: - Yogi Adityanath formed the Hindu Yuva Vahini Army on the day of Ramnavami in April 2002
 - yogi adityanath ne iskaa gathan socity registration act ke tahat kiya tha
 At the time of formation, Yogi had described it as a purely cultural organization aimed at stopping anti-hindu, anti-national activities
 - hindu yuva vahini ke gathan se pehle do chunaavon main yogi loksabhaa chunaav haarate-haarate jeet paae the
 - The 1998 election was won by Yogi by 26 thousand votes and the 1999 election by only 7322 votes
 - hindu yuva vahini kaa gathan karte hi yogi kii jeet kaa faasla bada hota chalaa gaya, 2014 kaa loksabhaa chunaav yogi adityanath ne 3 lakh se zyada voton se jeeta
 - Yogi Adityanath took the Hindu Yuva Vahini out of the scope of Gorakhpur and made it strong networking throughout Purvanchal

 During the Rath Yatra, Mahaprabhu returns to the temple with Jagannath, sister Subhadra and brother Balarama, on the same day he gives Rasgulla Prasad form to celebrate Lakshmi
 ise neeladri vijay kaa din kaha jaataa he
 Rasgulla is mentioned in the Dandi Ramayana written in the 15th century
 odisha ke kavi balramdaas ne apni kavy dandi ramayana ke ayodhya cond main bhagwaan ke bhoga main rasagulla kaa varnan kiya he
 Such is the basis of the claim of the Odisha government
 darasal, yah vivaad tab shuru hua jab pahaal main milane vaale rasagullon ko lekar beete saal odisha sarkaar ne jiaai tag hasil karne kaa prayaas kiya
 From here, this dessert is also supplied to West Bengal
 kisi bhi utpaada kaa jiaai tag uske sthaan vishesh kii pahchaan bataata he
 During the rath yatra last month, researcher Suryanarayana Sharma associated with the temple of Lord Jagannath made a claim that Rasgulla originated in Puri
 unke mutabik, bhagwaan jagannatha ne lakshmi ji ko prasann karne ke liye prasad swaroop chhene kii mithai rasgola diya tha
 RP Swain, a member of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD), who rose to power in the Assembly, raised the issue of Rasgulla in the Assembly and demanded that Odisha's efforts to sabotage this heritage must be thwarted
 rasagulla kii khoj ke pashchim bengal ke daawey ko dhwast karne ke liye padosi rajya odisha kii sarkaar ne tathy jutaney kii khatir teen samitiyaan gathit kii thi
 Three committees in Odisha have given preliminary reports on the Rasgulla dispute
 inke mutabik, ''beete 600 saal se rajya ke math-mandiron main bhagwaan ko lagaae jane vaale bhoga main rasagulla aaj bhi jagah banaae hue he
 "according to the state's Minister of Science and Technology and Education, Pradeep Kumar Panigrahi," We have many evidences
 puri ke jagannatha mandir main 12veen shatabdi main ek kitaab istemaal hoti thi-madlaapanji
 It is still today
 oriya kavi balram das ke kavy—dandi ramayana ke ayodhya cond main odisha main milane vaale rasagulle kaa zikr he
 Even Adi Shankaracharya was offered Rasgulla when he came to the Jagannath temple
 inase sabit hota he ki rasagulle kii paidaaish odisha kii he, bengal kii nahin
 "this is the most prevalent story associated with Rasgulla and West bengalrasgulla
 It was started by Nabin Chandra Das in Kolkata in 1868
 kai itihaaskaaron kii daleel he ki 17veen shatabdi se pehle bhartiya khanpan main ''chhena" kaa zikr nahin miltaa jo rasagulla banane ke liye sabase jaruri hota he
 Milk, curd and butter are also mentioned in Indian mythological legends, but Chena is not found
 is lihaaj se bengal kaa daawa majboot he
 By the way, till now people believed that Rasgulla is pure Bengali sweet
 or to or itihaas tatolenge to kai jagah yah zikr bhi mil jayega ki rasagulla portugaliyon kii kisi dish kaa hi viksit rup he
 If this news reaches Portugal by flying, then the third contender will also come
 baharhaal do rajyon ke bich mithaas bhari jang jari he
 Facts are being collected
 chhene kii is lajij mithai ko samajhane ke liye iskaa itihaas, bhugol sab kuch chaanana hoga, phir bhi rasagulla haath lag jaae, isaki guarantee nahin

 Out of the tytler-sajjan stage! There was a controversy even before Rahul Gandhi reached the fasting place
 rajghat se congress netaa jagadish titalar or sajjan kumaar ko waapas bhej diya gaya
 It is being told that as soon as Tytler reached there, Ajay Maken said something in his ear, after which he went back
 jagadish titalar or sajjan kumaar 1984 main hue sikh dangon ke aaropee hai
 However, Jagdish Tytler has said that he is not going anywhere, but will sit in the middle of public
 iske baad media main jaise hi titalar or sajjan kumaar korajghatse waapas bhejne kii khabaren chalin, bijepi ne congress par hamalaa kar diya
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that the Congress has today confessed by sending both these leaders back from Rajghat that the Congress leaders were guilty in the massacre that took place in 1984
 upwas sthal se bheed gayabado vivaadon ke baad jaise hi rahul gandhi rajghat pahunche, vahaan se logon kii bheed kam hone lagi
 Because earlier, the time of Rahul's arrival was being told at 11 am, but when Rahul Gandhi did not arrive on time and there were reports of sending Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar back
 is vivaad par congressi safai de hi rahe the ki rahul ke saath upwas main shaamil hone vaale congress netaaon ke chhole-bhature khaane kii khabar aa gai
 Probably due to frequent disputes, the common workers withdrew from Rajghat
 kyonki wo subah-subah upwas main shaamil hone ke liye rajghat pahunche the
 Because the crowd which was at Rajghat till 10 in the morning, it was over by Rahul's arrival
 haalanki der hi sahi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi sankethik upwas ke liye rajghat pahunche
 Arriving here, Rahul Gandhi accused PM Modi of being racist and anti-dalit and said that his party will always stand against the oppressive ideology of the BJP
 gauratlab he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne party kii pradesh ikaayiyon ke pramukhon ko samaaj ke sabhi virgon main sauhardra ko badhaava dene ke liye rashtravyapee upwas rakhane ke nirdesh diya tha
