 The matter is with the Minister of Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs Azam Khan and the matter is related to garbage disposal
 5 disambar, 2013 ko kanpur se 30 kimi dur panaki ke bhauti gaanv main chal rahe kooda nistaaran centre kaa nirikshan karne pahunche ajam khan hairat main pad gaye
 The closure of the solid waste management project led to a long mountain of garbage

 There was a lot of dirt and disease everywhere
 lekin ajam bebas the
 Instead of the head of his government, Azam Khan appealed to the President
 or 3 janvari, 2014 ko ek patr likhakar kanpur samet upi main kai jagah kooda nistaaran karne vaali 'e tu jed' naam kii company par kadi karrwai kii maang kar daali
 Says Azam, "I had called this company fraud from a to Z

 It brought a stay from the court

 Referring to Azam Khan, a member of the company's board of directors says, "some companies have convinced Azam Khan that she can make electricity from the garbage

 Unfortunately, Asia's finest solid waste management plant at Panki along the kanpur-agra highway has been converted into a dumping yard in the last two years
 karodon kii laagat vaali mashine or baari vaahan kooday main badal gaye hai
 This is the real picture of garbage disposal in UP
 saat saal pehle 2008 main bade dhooma-dhadaake ke saath shuru huin kooda prabandhan kii yojanaayen ab dam tod chuki hai
 (see chart) 500 crores from the government treasury in these projects
 se adhik lagane ke baad bhi shaharon ko kooday se nijaat nahin mili
 Around 10,000 metric tonnes of garbage released daily in the state has spoiled the appearance of cities
 isiilie upi ke shahar kendriya shahari vikaas mantralay ke swatchta ke maanakon par karaae gaye survey main sabase nichle paaydaanon par bisoorte hue dikhaai de rahe hai
 But is the state ashamed? In 2008, large-scale garbage management projects started in UP under the central government's Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM)
 jeenenyuarem kii 'urban infrastracchar and gavarnence (yuiji) skim', 'urban infrastracchar deveopment skim for small and medium touns' or 'satellite toun deveopment skim' ke tahat kul 27 solid west management project kii neenv daali gai
 500 crore for these projects running on Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis
 se adhik dhan kaa praavdhaan hua, lekin aaj saat saal baad keval aath shaharon main hi ye solid west management plant chal rahe hai
 Except Lucknow, all the nine plants set up in major cities have been closed
 asal main pradesh main zyaadaatar bahari companiyon ne adhikariyon se santhganth kar project lagane kaa jimmaa le liya, jabaki unhen sanchaalan kaa anubhav nahin tha
 An engineer from Jal Nigam's 'construction and Design Services' (C&DS), the nodal agency for waste management projects, says that as long as jnnurm's money kept coming in, the work continued
 jab companiyon ke kaam kii baari ai to unhone vivaad dikhaakar project band kar diya
 Nasimuddin Siddiqui, leader of the BSP in the Legislative Council and former cabinet minister, says, "why is the waste disposal project under the BSP government suddenly stopped in the SP government?" This is a sign of major corruption
 ''sarkari susti kaa alam yah he ki 2008 se firozabad, loni or basti main lagane vaale solid west management plant ke liye adhikari jagah tak nahin dhund paae hai
 The plant of the township is caught in a quarrel between the municipality and the C&DS
 udhar firozabad main kisaan jameen dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Embracing plans In fact, waste management projects in UP started in 2004, when the Central Government handed over two Solid Waste Management Projects to the state in the 'air Field Town' category
 ye project bareli or gajiabad main shuru hue
 a private university was also under construction near the project in Bareilly
 2013 main jab bareli kaa solid west management project banakar taiyaar hua to vishvavidhyalay prashasan ne isse chaatro ko nuksaan hone kii baat kahkar hycourt main yachika daayar kar di
 In the absence of relief from the court, the university applied to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the NGT stayed it
 ab yah project banane ke baad do saal se band padaa he
 The story of Ghaziabad was also no different
 2004 main yahaan ke duundaheda gaanv main solid west management project ke liye jameen aavantit kii gai
 As soon as the construction of the project started, the Ghaziabad Development Authority allotted the land around it to private builders
 do saal ke bheetar project ke aasapaas badi sankhya main houseing socity ke tower khadey ho gaye
 On the other hand, the builders petitioned the High Court to remove the project from the residential area, citing health
 hycourt se fatkaar milane par bilderon ne supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya
 The court stayed the construction of the project itself
 maamle kii sunwaayee jari he
 To prevent recurrence of such cases, C&DS has ordered all local bodies to declare the 500-meter area around the waste management project as 'no development zone'
 sarkaar kii gadabad nitisolid west management project band hone ke liye sarkari nitiyaan bhi jimmedaar hai
 Most of the projects were based on 'composting technology', in which manure is made from garbage
 sapa sarkaar banane ke baad in par kooday se bijli banane kaa dabaav daalaa gaya
 It was not under his responsibility and the project went on to close one by one from here
 itnaa hi nahin companiyon ne adhikariyon se milakar tender main kaaphi kam keemat kaa daawa kar project par kabja kar liya
 For example, 'tipping fees' for garbage companies have increased from 500 to 600 rupees
 ke bich rakhi, jabaki upi ke baahar sabhi shaharon main yah kam se kam 1500 ru

 jal nigam ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''sarkari madad se project lagane ke baad jab inhen chalaane kii baari ai to companiyon ko ghaataa mahasoos hone laga or unhone haath khadey kar die
 In Lucknow, Municipal Commissioner Uday Raj Singh has succeeded in reviving the closed project in Shivri by increasing the tipping fees by three times
 ab nagar vikaas vibhaag ne duusare jilon ko bhi lakhanu kii tarj par plant shuru karwaane kaa nirdesh diya he
 The government has not been able to make any plan for purchasing the waste produced from the waste and the 'rupuised Drive Fuel' which is generated from the waste
 kharidaar na hone se plant ko utpaada bechney main dikkat hui
 They incurred losses
 ajam khan kehete hai, ''sarkaar nae sire se kooday ke prabandhan par kaam kar rahi he
 Soon all waste management plants will be started
 ''kooda hua atal kaa sapanaagar aap bypass se bhartiya prabandhan santhaan (iiem), lakhanu se hardoi road kii ore aa rahe hai to gomti nadi kaa pul paar karte hi sadak ke donon ore lage kooday ke pahaad ek mahatvakankshi project kii badahaali kii daastaan bayaan karte hai
 From here, the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's ambitious plan to generate electricity from the waste has buried itself in the garbage in the Baravankhurd area, about half a kilometer away
 janvari, 2001 main apaaramparik urja strot mantralay ne vaajapeyi ke sansadeey kshetra lakhanu main kareeb 100 karod ru
 This plan was flagged off
 iske baad nagar nigam sadan ne saat acre jameen 30 varsh ke liye pariyojna ko de di
 Two years later, in June 2003 the construction was completed and the work of producing electricity from waste began
 november, 2003 main project kaa kaam dekh rahi company asia baio energy ne plant ko milane vaale kooday main se 25 fisadi ko anupayogi bataakar waapas kar diya
 Within a year the waste was over 90 per cent and the plant was locked
 vaajapeyi ke is dream project kii nigaraanee karne vaale ek adhikari bataate hai, ''kooday se bijli banane kaa yah project biomithenation takanic par chalanaa tha
 Later, the Supreme Court stayed the project on biomethanation from getting loan from the bank till the government showed at least five projects with this technology successfully
 '' haalanki do saal pehle yah roak hat gai, lekin kooday se bijli banane vaale project kii badahaali barkaraar he
 The dream of Azam's dream to make electricity from the litter of former Prime Minister Vajpayee may not have come true, but Azam Khan's dream has got wings
 unke shahar rampur main kooday se bijli banane kii desh kii ek anokhi pariyojna kii neenv padi he
 The company from Mysore, Karnataka, is going to set up the country's first 'waste to Energy Plant' on 'plasma Gasification Technology' at Rampur after getting permission from the Cabinet as a 'model project'

 neemuch jile kii manasa tehsil ke mokalpura gaanv main primeriskulki sthapana kagajaat main to saal 2012 main hi ho gai, lekin paanch saal bitne ke baad bhi yahaan bacchon ke padhane ke liye ek cameraa tak nahin ban sakaa
 The school has a total of 17 children from first to fourth grade
 in sabhi ko padhaane ke liye skool main ek hi shikshak kailash chandra rathore hai
 Throughout the year, Rathore teaches children in the open, working under trees, but it is not possible to do so during rainy days
 do saal pehle tak yah skool kachche makaan main lagata tha
 The snakes made their bill there, so the children stopped going there in fear
 shikshak rathore apni jimmedaari ko acchhee tarah samajhate hai
 Therefore, they always try to ensure that there is no hindrance in children's education
 barish ke dinon main bacchon kii padhai jari rakhane ke liye bhi samaadhaan unhone dhund nikaala
 a toilet is built in the name of a government building in the village, but this toilet was never started for the original purpose for which it was built
 aise main is toilet kaa hi bacchon kii paathshaala ke taur par istemaal kiya jane laga
 Rathore says that teaching children in the open on rainy days is not free from danger
 ek to bacchon ke biimaar hone kaa khatra rahata he, vahiin saanp-bichchhu jaise jahrile jeevon ke kaatane kii bhi ashanka hoti he
 a video of the school running in the toilet also went viral on social media
 is video main shikshak ko kehete suna ja saktaa he ki adhikariyon se tamaam guzaarishon ke baavjood gaanv main skool ke liye kamare ke nirmaan kii vyavastha nahin ho saki
 However, Rathore, the teacher on camera, refrained from speaking more about the subject
 vahiin, gaanv vaale rathore kii tarif karte nahin thakte
 He says that Rathore does not compromise on children's education
 kaise bhi halaat hon, wo bacchon ko padhaane ke liye jarur aate hai
 In this case, Manasa's SDM was talked to Vandana Mehra, and he accepted with impunity that due to lack of school building in the village, children are studying in the toilet
 haalanki unhone yah bhi saath joda ki toilet ke liye jo nirmaan hua uskaa kabhi toilet kii tarah istemaal nahin hua
 According to the SDM, the village has a very small population
 pehle ek kachche makaan main skool chalata tha, lekin jahrile jantuon ke dar se use khaali kar diya gaya
 The SDM said that there are fewer than 20 children who have been ordered to shift to a nearby school
 desh kii rajdhani dilli ke vidhansabha chunaav main mili apmanjanak haar ne bijepi ke saath-saath sangh ko bhi mushkil main daal diya he
 On Thursday, Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi, the three co-sarkaryavah Krishna Gopal, Dattatreya Hosabale and Suresh Soni took serious note of the fresh political situation at the Union Headquarters Jhandewalan in Delhi
 sutron ke mutabik is baithak kaa ahm agenda agle maheene 13-15 march ko nagpur main hone vaali akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii baithak ke mudde the, lekin dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii haar par bhi manthan hua
 In this meeting, the Sangh has first sought a ground report on the bjp's defeat from its volunteers working in Delhi, and on the other hand, from the meeting, the bjp's general secretary Ramlal was directed to report the election defeat of the Delhi Assembly
 sangh yah samajhnaa chahta he ki aakhir bijepi kya report detii he or uske swayamsevakon kaa is haar ko lekar kya kahana he
 However, on February 15, a meeting of the BJP and the Sangh's Coordination Committee is also scheduled to be held in which the co-sarkaryavah Krishna Gopal, Dattatreya Hosabale will be accompanied by four big ministers of the Modi government, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Sushma Swaraj etc
 bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke bete kii shaadi kaa resepshan samaaroh hone kii vajah se unki maujuudagi ko lekar abhi sanshay he
 The meeting of the coordination committee will specifically discuss the defeat of Delhi and its extract will be sent to the Sangh chief as a preliminary report
 lekin dilli vidhansabha chunaav kii haar ne sangh ko is kadar chintit kar diya he ki usne is mudde par akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main bhi kargar ranneeti banane kaa man bana liya he
 If sources are to be believed, it was clearly expressed in the meeting that electoral defeats and victories continue, but such humiliating defeats are a matter of great concern as the BJP as well as the Sangh had just given their strength in this election
 
 sutron kaa kahana he ki pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main sangh is tarah kii doorgaami kaaryayojna par bhi vichaar karegaa jisase bhavishya main is tarah kii durgati nahin ho

 How 6 years ago Ranbir Kapoor was left to become the star of 100 crore club and now he has entered 300 crore club
 duniyabar main chai unki film sanju ne 500 karod rupee kii kamai kaa aankada paar karke ye bataa hi diya ki vah bhi bollywood top stars kii res main shaamil hai
 Box office: Sanju, who has crossed 500 crores, Ranbir again in the new song, every time in his film, this actor, who presents a new flavor and look of acting, is getting praise from all four
 ranbir kapur kaa sirf luks ke saath experiment balki acting ke saath bhi kiya gaya experiment hit sabit hua he
 Ranbir always wanted to be a hit actor like his grandfather Raj Kapoor but his family first wanted Ranbir to pass 10th
 ranbir ko sanju banane main 6 ghante chalaa mechap 30 second main hota tha khaarijranbir ne khud ek intervyuu main bataaya ki jab 10veen main unke 58% marks aae to unke parivaar ne america main is baat ko lekar jashn manaaya tha
 The reason for celebrating the average marks also was that in the first one or two generations in his family, no one could pass the 10th
 iske alaava kisi ko ummid bhi nahin thi ki ranbir 10veen paas kar lenge kyonki ruchi padhai se zyada cinema main hi thi
 These days, which will be the next film of Ranbir Kapoor, who is enjoying Sanju's success, now the audience is interested in it
 bataa den ranbir kapur kii agali film shamshera he
 In this film, he will be seen in the lead role alongside Sanjay Dutt
 is film main bhi ranbir ek baar phir ek alag kirdaar main najar aane vaale hai
 The blast also took place on Monday in the Bueni area of quetta near a vehicle on the Spini road in Huaquetta bijepi ne sadhvi pragna thakur ko bhopal se ummidavaar banaaya he
 She is pitted against veteran Congress leader Digvijay Singh, who named her a saffron militant after the name of Sadhvi in the Malegaon blast
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahe digvijay singh aresas or bijepi par tikhe hamale karne ke liye jane jate rahe hai
 BJP President Amit Shah has also said that we have brought Sadhvi Pragya Thakur against those who are the originators of the term Hindu terrorism
 kayaas yah bhi lagaae ja rahe hai ki jis tarah uma bharti ne digvijay singh kii congress sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkaa tha kya usee tarah sadhvi pragna digvijay kii raajnneetik aakanksha par viraam laga dengi
 Because Sadhvi Pragya and Uma Bharti have many similarities
 donon kaa vivaadon se naata rahaa he
 Both of them are also of the same type
 uma bharti 1999 main usee bhopal se saansad chuni gai thim jahaan se sadhvi pragna ko ummidavaar banaaya gaya he
 After the announcement of Sadhvi Pragya's candidature from Bhopal, the words in which Digvijay welcomed her seem to be that he does not want to do anything that benefits Sadhvi
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki uma bharti ke baad madhya pradesh main bijepi ko doosraa firebrands netaa mil gaya he
 Digvijay Singh once used to speak in Congress, he was the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh continuously from 1993 to 2003
 usase pehle bijepi ke sunderlaal patwa madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri the
 Digvijay Singh, while the Madhya Pradesh Congress President, undertook the entire state march and managed to oust the BJP from power
 isi tarah uma bharti ne bhi congress ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaaya tha or puure pradesh kaa daura kiya tha
 Digvijay Singh was defeated by a sadhvi after 10 years as CM
 bhopal se sadhvi pragna ke utarane ke baad yah kayaas lagaae jane lage hai ki kya ek baar phir sadhvi ke haathon hi digvijay kii haar hogi yaa is baar vah apana vajood bachaane main kaamyaab honge?sadhvi pragna thakur bhi usee tarah kii fire brands netaa maani jaati hai jaisi uma bharti maani jaati rahi hai
 Uma Bharti also wears saffron clothes and the dress of Sadhvi Pragya Thakur is exactly the same
 kate hue bal or, bhagava vastra or gale main rudraksh kii maala unki pahchaan he
 Uma Bharti has announced that she will not contest this time, so 48-year-old Sadhvi Pragya Thakur can also prove to be Bharti's successor in politics
 uma bharti ko bijepi kii kaddavar netaa vijayaraaje sindhiya ne sangrakshan diya tha or unhen raajnneeti main aage badhaayaa tha
 Uma Bharti was also influenced by the Sangh since childhood and later was elected BJP MP, MLA, similarly Sadhvi Pragya Thakur also has an old relationship with the Sangh
 unhone akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad main bhi kaam kiya he
 Pragya has also been associated with Durga Vahini, the women's wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 uma bharti kii shiksha kaksha chhathvin tak hi hui he lekin sadhvi pragna ne em e tak padhai kii he
 Uma Bharti was elected MP from this Bhopal in 1999, from where Sadhvi Pragya Thakur has been fielded
 bhopal se saansad chune jane ke baad hi party ne tay kiya tha ki unamem hi digvijay kii satta ko ukhaad phenkane kii kshamta he
 After this, BJP had entrusted him with the responsibility of Madhya Pradesh
 2003 main madhya pradesh main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko do tihaai bahumat mila tha or uma bharti ko madhya pradesh kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya tha
 He ousted Digvijay Singh
 uma bharti kaa vivaadon se naata rahaa he vah apni belaag tippanee ke liye jaani jaati hai
 Uma Bharti was also expelled from the party for opposing Advani
 uma bharti ko babari masjid ke vidhwans ke baad badi pahchaan mili thi
 Similarly, Sadhvi Pragya is also considered as a powerful speaker
 maalegaanv blast main naam aane ke baad sadhvi pragna ko puure desh main pahchaan mili
 Even today, the trial is going on in the special court of Special NIA
 uma bharti par bhi babari vidhwans maamle main aaropee hai
 Things have changed
 digvijay singh apni khoi hui jameen waapas paane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 When he expressed his desire to contest the election of MP, MP CM Kamal Nath said that if Digvijay Singh wants to contest the election, he should choose a tough seat
 bhopal or indore ko congress ke liye sabase kathin seat mana jaataa he
 The last time he was elected Congress MP in 1984 in Bhopal
 1989 se lekar 2014 tak lagaataar yahaan se bijepi baaji maarthi rahi
 In such a situation, Digvijay accepted the challenge of Bhopal
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agar digvijay singh yah ladaai jeet jate hai to unhen mukhyadhara main laana party kii majaburi hogi
 But if Sadhvi loses to Pragya Thakur, then she will have to work harder to gain her land
 digvijay 72 saal ke ho chuke hai
 In such a situation, this election becomes more important for them
 yah tay he ki sadhvi pragna digvijay ko hindutv ke mudde par gherengi
 After getting a ticket from Bhopal, she also said that she will fight against those who stain Indian culture
 haalanki digvijay singh un par kadi tippanee karne se bachate dikhe
 Nine students in the car were killed when a car collided with a truck on the pune-solapur highway in Maharashtra late on Friday night
 yah haadasa kadamvak basti ke sameep kareeb dedh baje hua
 An officer of Loni Kalbhor police station said, "those who came to know about this accident were going to their hometown Yavat from Raigarh towards Solapur
" unki car najadik aa rahe trek se takaraa gayi
 He said that all the nine passengers of the car died in this accident
 unki umr 19-23 varsh ke bich thi
 The official said, "the bodies have been taken for postmortem
 maamle kii jaanch kii ja rahi he
 ' mosul main 39 bharatiyon kii maut par congress ne modi sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he or kaha he ki sarkaar ne desh ko gumraah kiya he
 The Congress expressed grief over the deaths of 39 Indians, but also took a dig at the Modi government
 congress media vibhaag ke prabharee randeep singh surajevaala ne sarkaar par aarope lagaaya he ki modi sarkaar ne asamvedansheeltaa, nirmamata or nirdayata kii sari hadein paar kar di hai
 Surjewala said that Modi government is responsible for not bringing back 39 Indians safely
 ab tak 39 bharatiyon ke jivit hone kaa daawa kyon kar rahi thi modi sarkaar?surajevaala ne kaha, '39 bhartiya june, 2014 main agava kiye gaye
 The entire world and the neighboring countries were confirming that 39 Indians are no longer alive, but the Indian government has issued a report on 23 June 2014, 9 July 2014, 17 July 2014, 24 July 2014, 6 August 2014, 22 July 2015 and 16 July
 2017 means seven times, told the families of 39 countries and 39 Indians that they are all alive
 yahaan tak bhi kaha ki wo jivit hai or unako bhojan ityadi sabhi jarurat kii suvidhaayen mil rahi hai
 "earlier the death report was rejected outright" Surjewala has questioned why Modi government, Ministry of External Affairs and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj were misleading, why were they misleading family members? Sushma Swaraj ji and the Modi government rejected it when the Indian media risked their lives in Mosul, Iraq in July 2017 and reported that 39 of India's citizens were not alive
 jab ek chashmadid gavaah saamne aayaa or usne bhi kaha ki 39 bharatiyon kii iesai ke ugravadiyon dwaara hatya kar di gai thi, to use bhi sire se khaarij kar diya
 The Foreign Minister's statement is embarrassing: The surjewalamodi government even said that when the Prime Minister of Iraq comes to India, he will be confirmed by asking him, but nothing is done
 sawaal ye he ki modi sarkaar or sushamaa swaraj desh or un parivarajanon kii ankhon main dhul kyon jhonk rahi thi? sabase durbhaagya kii baat to ye he ki videsh mantri sushamaa aaj ye kah rahi hai- mare kaa sabar aa jaataa he
 Surjewala told Prime Minister Modi and Sushma that when those families who had been waiting impatiently for the past several years, died every day in memory of 39 Indians, did you ever care for them? When he came to meet the Foreign Minister a dozen times, pleading for justice, bringing back the family, you still did not tell him the truth? And you are telling us that the Congress party is doing politics
 ye kahana ki mare kaa sabar aa jaataa he, isse zyada sharmnaak baat un 39 pariwaron ke prati berahami kii ho nahin sakati
 The Congress said the reason for Sushma's statement in Parliament and the press conference, Surjewala said that the matter does not end here
 39 bhartiya mar gaye or videsh mantri aaj bhi sarkaar kii peeth thapthapa rahi hai, ve pradhanmantri ji kaa or apni sahyogi mantri kaa dhanyavad kar rahi hai
 Thanks to what the Government of India could not save the lives of 39 Indians and continued to mislead their family and country for 4 years? Thanks for this? And today in a hurry when the Foreign Minister inside both houses of Parliament makes a statement, puts the press talks first and forgets to say that this haste was not due to the fact that the Martyrs Foundation of Iraq today, according to Indian times After noon, by holding a press conference, it was decided to keep the whole truth of 39 Indians alive
 mujhe ye bhi bataaya gaya or vakt check karen ki aaj dhai baje unhone patrkaar vaarta karke ye sari sachai ujagar bhi kii he or jab laga ki pole khul jaaegi to phir aapane hadabadi main ye bayaan de daalaa
 When no confidence arrived, you gave this statement
 parivarajanon ko tivi par mili 39 bharatiyon kii maut kii suchnarandeep surajevaala ne kaha, 'kam se kam jo bhartiya hamaare bich main nahin he, unki maut par to raajnneeti nahin honi chahie thi
 Unfortunately even today the Modi government and Sushma ji are doing politics, which is condemnable
 ye aapako shobhaa nahin detaa, ham vinamrata se yahi kahenge or wo sari pidaa, wo sara dukh, wo sara dil dahalane vaala intjaar, jis budhi maa, jis pita, jis beti, jis biviyon se aapane karavaaya he, kya ab ye bhi unako din dekhnaa tha ki unke parivarajanon kii maut ke bare jaankaree samvedansheel tareeke se pariwaron ko bataane kii bajaae, sarkaar ne yah soochna televijan par bataai
 Can there be any more incident of cruelty than this? Modi government should apologize to each family; Congress government has demanded that the foreign minister go to each family and apologize for misleading them and Modi government honors the victim family with honorable compensation So that they can start their lives
 is mudde par congress party dwaara raajnneeti karne ke sawaal par surajevaala ne kaha ki durbhaagya se koi agar raajnneeti kar rahaa he, to wo sushamaa swaraj or modi sarkaar he
 You knew for 4 years, Indians were abducted in June 2014
 7 baar sansad main kaha gaya ki wo jinda hai, sushamaa swaraj ne ye bhi kaha ki unako bhojan mil rahaa he, unako har prakaar kii jaruri suvidhaayen mil rahi hai

 '' The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has announced that it has no evidence regarding Iran's nuclear program
 agency ne ek vaktavy main kaha ‘‘haal kii media kii khabaron ko dekhte hue ieie doharaata he ki uske paas iran ke parmaanu kaarykram ke sambandh main koi thos saboot nahin hai
 Earlier in the board of governors meeting on 9 September, the agency's director Mohammed Al Baradei denied the allegation that the agency had evidence in this regard
 unhone in aaropon ko raajnneeti se prerit or puri tarah se niraadhaar bataaya tha
 Hours before the director's statement, a dialogue committee revealed, based on an intelligence report, that IAEA experts agreed that Iran was capable of building a nuclear bomb and that it was on track to build a missile system
 agar aap sona kharidne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai, to bajet kaa intjaar kar len
 At present, the gold which has crossed 31 thousand can be cheaper after the budget
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki bajet ke baad sone kii keemten kam ho sakati hai
 The Indian Bullion Jewelers Association (IBJA) hopes that Finance Minister Arun Jaitley can reduce the import duty on gold in this budget
 agar aisa hota he, to isse sone kii keemton main 600 se 1200 rupee tak kii kami aa sakati he
 Saif Gadgil, vice-president of the import duty association, will expect that Finance Minister Jaitley may cut gold import duty by 2 to 4 per cent
 unka kahana he ki aayaat shulk ghatane se sone kii keemton main lagaataar aa rahi teji par brake lagegaa
 With this, buying gold will also be cheaper
 aise milegaa aapako phaaydabharat main sone kii jitani khapat hoti he, uskaa 95 fisadi se zyada aayaat kiya jaataa he
 Currently, 31000 rupees have to be paid for 10 grams
 agar aayaat shulk main ek fisadi kii bhi katautee hoti he, to prati 10 gram aayaat karne kii laagat main 300 rupee se zyada kii kami aegi
 In such a situation, if the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley cuts the budget by 2 to 4 percent, then the price of gold can come down from Rs 600 to 1200 per 10 grams
 vitt mantri jetali kii taraf se yah kadam uthaanaa tay mana ja rahaa he
 The bullion industry says that import duty has encouraged the smuggling of gold into the country
 philhal desh main sone ke aayaat par 10 fisadi aayaat shulk lagata he
 The industry believes that if the government cuts the import duty, it will not only benefit the common man, but can also help in curbing the smuggling of gold

 ) Congress leader Shashi Tharoor may have a polygraph test in the Sunanda Pushkar case
 dilli police unhen is test ke liye bula sakati he
 a few days ago a polygraph test of Shashi Tharoor's servant and staff was done
 dilli police kamishnar bhimsen bassi ne pushti kii ki maamle kii tah tak pahunchane ke liye jaanch team sabhi jaruri kadam uthaaegi
 According to news received from sources, the police will take further action in this case after getting permission from the court
 sutron kaa kahana he ki poligraph test ke liye police ko court se ijaajat leni hogi or yah tabhi ho saktaa he jab iske liye khud shashi tharur bhi taiyaar hon
 Significantly, Shashi Tharoor has already said that he is ready to fully cooperate in the investigation
 philhal dilli police kii ore se poligraph test ke liye koi aavedan nahin kiya gaya he
 It is worth mentioning that Delhi Police has already conducted polygraph test of 6 witnesses in the case of Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Tharoor
 bataa den ki sunanda pushkar (51) dilli ke lila hotel main janvari 2014 ko apnekmare main mrit pain gai thim

 aapane dushmano ko thikaane lagane ke namaaloom kitne hi tareeke dekhe yaa phir sune honge, lekin kisi kii jaan lene kaa ye tarika chaunkaane vaala he
 Lots of love or wrangling in letters
 lekin ek chitthee aisi bhi he jo maut baantati he
 This case of letter bomb or parcel bomb is from Gaya in Bihar, where a parcel wrapped in a beautiful gift pack arrives at the house of a leader
 packet par ise bhejnevaale kaa naam-pataa bhi likhaa he, lekin jaise hi parcel khulata haiek dhamaake ke saath mautbaahar aa jaati he
 This incident of Gaya city has shocked everyone
 is ajibo-garib bam dhamaake main jahaan ek shaks kii jaan chali gai, vahiin isane bihar ke siyaasi halake main bhi ek nai bahes kii shuruyaat kar di
 Because the bomb exploded in Gaya, but not in the house of JDU district president Abhay Kumar Kushwaha, who is considered to be close to the ruling party leader and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 mangalvaar, 26 may 2015kujapi mohalle main wo ek aam subah thi
 The family members of JDU leader Abhay Kushwaha saw that someone had left with a parcel on their doorstep
 ye kisi bhi ghar main aane vaale parcel se thodaa alag tha, kyonki aam taur par courier yaa dak ke jariye aanevaale aise kisi bhi packet yaa gift kii delivery ke dauraan use pahunchane vaala shaks baqayada ghar waalon se isaki riciving lekar jaataa he
 Abhay Kumar Kushwaha's name and his full address were written by typing on the parcel in a computerized manner
 ise bhejne vaale main patna ke kisi inayat khan kaa naam tha
 Although the full address of Patna was not written on this box, but then the Kushwaha family had no doubt of any conspiracy behind it
 khubasurat raper main lipta parcel pehali najar main hi koi shandaar gift lag rahaa tha
 Abhay Kushwaha was not in his house then
 lihaaja, gharavaalon ne wo packet uthaakar andar rakh liya
 After about an hour, Kushwaha's wife Anjali noticed the packet kept at home
 wo aage badhkar packet ko kholane kii koshish karti hai, lekin abhi raper hi hataa tha ki unhen andar se laal-pile taron kaa ek guchha najar aata he
 Bunch of strings and start of suspicion Anjali did not understand anything when she saw a bunch of strings in the package
 unhone yah baat apane mulajim santosh ko bataai
 Santosh informed Anjali's brother, who is sleeping at home, and Jaihind, Kushwaha's brother-in-law
 donon ne hi apane-apane str par gift ko dekha
 He suspected that there might be a bomb in this parcel of gifts
 lihaaja, donon fouran parcel ko ghar se baahar lekar chale gaye
 Santosh, who works in Kushwaha's house, tried to double-check the parcel
 lekin tabhi ek joardaar dhamaake ke saath parcel fat gaya
 With this explosion, there was smoke and darkness in front of everyone's eyes for some time
 lekin jab dhuaan chanta to santosh or jaihind donon maukey par lahooluhaan pade the
 Seeing this scene, it was a normal thing to be in the entire locality
 aage padhein, kya kahati he police kii chaanbinpulice, aspataal or santosh kii mautaas-paas ke logon kii madad se dhamaake ke fouran baad donon ghayalon ko aspataal pahunchaaya jaataa he, lekin dhamaake main buree tarah jakhmi santosh ko doctor aspataal pahunchate hi murda bataa dete hai
 The police also arrive at the opportunity
 bihar ke naksal prabhavit jilon main se ek hone kii vajah se gaya or uske aas-paas isse pehle dhamaakon kii anginat vaardaat ho chuki thi
 But this was the first time the explosion occurred in the face of a parcel bomb
 kai din guzarane ke baavjood police ko is maamle main hamalaavaron ke koi khaas suraag nahin mil sake hai
 But the way this parcel bomb was sent to the house of a leader, it is so clear that Abhay Kumar Kushwaha, who sent the bomb, had gathered a lot of details about it
 darasal, kushavaala padhe likhe to hai hi unhen online kharidari kaa bhi acha khaasaa shauk he
 This is the reason that the arrival of such packets and parcels in their home is not new
 unhen gift dene waalon kaa silsilaa bhi laga rahata he
 What the police say: In the presence of a parcel, the mystery of this death reached the house of JDU leader Abhay Kumar Kushwaha is so deep that even after several days Gaya police have not been able to find its ends
 darasal, police kii maane to ek parcel main bam pack karnaa
 Putting a beautiful gift wrapper on him and then surreptitiously delivering it to the leader's doorstep indicates that it is not the hand of a novice crook, but a conspiracy of a vicious mind
 sutron kaa kahana he ki hamale ke peeche kushvaha kaa koi aisa dushman ho saktaa he, jisase unki tarakkee se takalif he
 Because in recent times Kushwaha's stature has not only increased in the party, but he is also expected to get a ticket in the election
 parcel bam kaa itihashgaya main parcel bam se hui ek maut ke maamle main beshak sabko chaunkaa diya ho, lekin taarikh gavaah he ki duniya main parcel bam kaa silsilaa koi nayaa nahin he
 It has been in operation since the 18th century
 pehla parcel bam europe main astitv main aayaa, jab denmark main pehali baar iskaa istemaal kiya gaya
 After this, parcel bombs were used in many places in the world in the 19th century
 america ke dushmano ne 1915 main tatkaaleen up raashtrapati thomas marshall ko letters bam kaa nishaanaa bananaa chaha
 Even in 1947, a parcel bomb was sent to US President Harry Trrowman, but was then rendered useless by the White House security agencies
 aage chalakar israeli khufia agency mosaad ne parcel bam kaa jamkar istemaal kiya
 In England too, nine people were injured in the 2007 series of bomb blasts
 2014 main bhi england fouj ke bhartee daftaron main 7 letters bam saamne aae
 From time to time, news of letter bombs came out from all over the world
 hindustan main letters bam ke kuch maamle surkhiyaan batorte rahe
 In October 2012, Chaitali, a human rights activist from Howrah, was killed by a parcel bomb

 Kangana Ranaut, who came in 'koffee with Karan' at the time of the release of the film 'rangoon', had strongly accused Karan Johar
 haalanki sho kii maryaada ko dhyaan main rakhte hue karan ne us samay to kuch nahin kaha, lekin landan main unhone iske khulkar jawaab die hai
 i have given a chance to everyone
 In conversation, Karan Johar has said - Kangana was a guest on my show
 unhen apni raay dene kaa puraa haq he lekin jab unhone bollywood main bhai-bhatijawad ke vishay par apni raay di to main bas itnaa hi kahunga ki vah shaayad maamle ko puri tarah samaj nahin pai hai
 Learn how Kanganakaran, who became Julia from Jwala Devi, said- All the films i have made, am i working with my son, daughter or nephew? What would you say about those 15 filmmakers who are not from the film industry and i gave them a chance
 tarun mansukhani, shakun batra, shashaank khetaan yaa phir punit malhotra - ye filmi bekagraund se taalluk nahin rakhte
 Why doesn't anyone talk about them
 apni biography main karan johar ne apni sexuelity ke bare main kiya khulaasjaha tak baat actors se sambandhit he to karan ne kaha he ki unhone filmi becoground vaale varun dhawan or aalia bhatta ko chance diya
 But with this, Siddharth Malhotra was also introduced in the industry, with the same strong role
 aise main karan ne kangana kii baat par hi sawaal uthaa diya he
 Study Suman pinched Lee Kangna, said- Save the Titanic from drowning
 Who is the movie Mafikaran has also responded strongly to Kangana Ranot's movie mafia comment
 karan ne ulate sawaal daaga- kangana ke mutabik movie mafia kaa kya matlab he
 What do they think we are doing? If we are not giving him films then we become movie mafia! Karan said that if he is not interested in working with Kangana, then he would not have become a movie mafia
 haalanki karan ne is par khushi jataai ki kangana ranot kaa har vishay ko dekhne kaa apana najariya he or har kisi ne unki sho par aane ko lekar unki saraahna kii
 Karan Johar revealed: Do not play money for first time sex
 The way Karkangana talked to Karan of suffering, many people are saying that 'queen' has given a tight reply to this film maker
 lekin karan kehete hai ki unka sho par chup rahanaa ek host kii maryaada thi
 Apart from Karan Johar, named Yash and Roohi, the single child of the twins, Karan advises Kangana to give up the habit of being sympathetic to both the woman and the victim
 unhone kaha ki kangana har baar apni dukh bhari kahani sunaakar or industry ko bura bataa kar logon ko apni ore karti hai
 If they really think so, then it is better that they stay away from this place

 100 crores for a film till some time ago
 kii kamai kaa lakshya naammumkin mana jaataa tha
 Nowadays, the films that touch this business fork are considered more successful than the rest
 ateet main jo silver, golden yaa diamond jubilee kii catagori hua karti thim, yah paimaana usase koi alag nahin he
 This is the same as if a batsman hits a half-century or a century, there is a lot of applause for him
 aisa nahin ki 49 yaa 99 ran kii uplabdhi kuch kam he, lekin hamaare dimag main darasal 100 kaa kanta aise atak gaya he ki ham usee ko kasuti maan baithe hai
 If you take some of the highly successful Golden Jubilee films of the 1970s and 1980s and estimate their earnings at today's value of rupees, then the entire Rs 100 crore
 ke paar hongi or kuch to 200 karod ru
 Will cross sholay or jai santoshi maa ek hi hafte main relies hui thim
 Jai Santoshi Maa was a low budget film
 sholay ke mukaable dasven hisse kii rakam main bechi gai thi, baavjood usne shuruaati pradarshan main baraabar kaa kaarobaar kiya
 We all know that Sholay has become a symbol of blockbuster and does not even mention the other film against him (although i have done it)
 hamen kamyaabi ko aankane ke liye koi shabd chahie, isliye kal kii ‘golden jubilee’ aaj ‘‘100 karod ru
 '' Has turned into earnings
 sabhi film nirmaataa box offis kamai ko lekar pareshaan rahete hai or chaahate hai ki ve safal hon
 i have no doubt that in the coming days, film producers will choose a star on the basis of whether they will get Rs 100 crore
 ke club main le jane kii guarantee de saktaa he yaa nahin
 Now the 25–50 week period of films has gone, so success is weighed with money today
 is myne main 100 karod ru
 There is enough money, but the arithmetic of earnings, expenses and sales is complicated
 mana ek film ko banane main 50 karod ru
 15-20 crores on its promotion
 bhi kharch honge iske alaava byaaj bhi jodie
 This will cost 70 crores
 tak pahunch jaati he
 To make a profit, the film must trade at twice its production cost
 isliye is film ko 140 karod ru
 Will have to earn ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki aakhir kitni filmein is aankade tak pahunch paati hai
 Conversely, there are some other films which cost between Rs 12-15 crore
 main banati hai or 60-70 karod ru
 They earn up to Rs
 yah laagat kaa chaar guna he
 100 crores Rs
 vaali se tulana karen to yah kam bajet vaali film behatar jaan padati he
 i expect today's filmmakers to make 100 crores
 kaa kanta chune vaali film ko banane ke dabaav main nahin aaenge
 If creativity was forced to kneel in front of a certain amount, it would be a ridiculous joke
 ek film main kahani ke chayan, script or uske banane tak jitne bhi tatv daale jate hai, un sabakaa ek hi uddeshy hota he ki film ‘‘manoranjak’’ ban sake taaki zyada se zyada log use dekhen
 How to convert it into earnings and profits is a complex issue
 yah bilkul us tarah he jaise akhbaar yaa patrika nikaalte vakt yah chunanaa ki koun-si khabar pehle panne par ja sakati he, or aisa karte vakt yah dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he ki zyada-se-zyada log weekend par hi chizon ko padhate hai
 In today's film business, the thinking about the first weekend is also similar
 yahi film kii kamyaabi or haisiyat kaa maanak paimaana bhi ban gaya he
 As far as 'rating' is concerned, the term itself is inconsistent
 aakhir paanch yaa saat stars film ke badhibia hone kaa paimaana kaise hai? isaki jagah 20 yaa 30 yaa phir 10 stars bhi ho sakate hai? paimaane sanket dete hai, haalanki inke peeche apana tark hota he
 They are also determined by how the market responds
 multiplexes kaa bolbalaa he or tikaton kii keemten badi hai
 This increase has been made by taking care of the pockets of the fast growing middle class
 is sab kii vajah se kamai badi he or ab laagat kii vasuuli kaaphi teji se ho jaati he
 With the major portion of the cost recovered within three days, the film itself is able to recover all its expenses
 is vasule gaye paise main tivi par tatkaal dikhaae jane se jude prasaaran adhikaar kii kamai bhi hoti he
 The credibility of the film is now being assessed rapidly because today due to fast communication mediums it reaches the world in an instant
 piresi bhi ek masalaa he
 It is not three weeks in theaters that you can watch it on TV without spending any money
 ab sochie ki jab saat se das saal kii avadhi tak kisi film ke vitaran adhikaar ek distributor ko de die gaye hon, to us film kii reating kisi hogi
 India Today magazine was fortnightly weekly due to this idea because by the end of the month any news will be stale after rapid communication is available with everyone
 mujhe nahin lagata ki darshakon ko 100 karod ru
 There would be some concern with the figure of darshak aapako film main aapaki acting ke liye pasand karata he, kamai ke liye nahin
 The more discerning audience sees only those films which have a "good story"
 haalanki isaki vajah se khantee commercial film ke contant kaa majaak udaane ke koi myne nahin
 It is important that both types of cinema exist
 hamaare samaaj yaa kisi bhi samaaj main donon kii hi praasangikta he
 Eventually both Playboy and Time created their own image in the same market
 mere liye yah sochna bhi bura hoga ki main apni (simit) creativity ko sirf ek vittiya lakshya ko chune ke chakkar main jhonk duun
 It would be very bad if we started making films by weighing only on the scale of financial success
 twitor par amitabh bachchan ke 58,44,037 folbers hai
 If you take some of the highly successful Golden Jubilee films of the 1970s and 1980s and estimate their earnings at today's value of rupees, then the entire Rs 100 crore
 ke paar hongi or kuch to 200 karod ru
 Will cross mujhe ummid he ki aaj ke filmkaar 100 karod ru
 Will not be under pressure to make a film that touches the fork
 creativity ko agar ek nishchit rakam ke saamne ghutane techne par majaboor kiya gaya to yah bhadda majaak hoga

 It was taken incorrectly
 jahaan tak meraa sawaal he to main desh kii taraf se khilne ke liye taiyaar hum
 If i need a match against Serbia and if i am played in any role, either player or captain, i will try to give my best
 ' pes ne kaha, 'mere paas eitie se bulaava aana chahie main bharat ke liye apana sarvshereshth duungaa
 AITA runs tennis in India and if they feel that my presence can change then i will be with the team for the match against Serbia
 ' isse pehle reporton main kaha gaya tha ki pes sitambar main hone vaale mukaable ke liye uplabdh nahin rahenge lekin is diggaj khilaadi ne kaha ki unke bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya

 is sho main unke apozit sonarika bhadauria nazar ain thi
 Regarding the show, Shaheer said in an interview, 'people who knew me were quite surprised to know that i had signed the show because i often criticize Daily Soaps because these shows have no So there is neither a character graph nor a story
 isliye maine kai shos ko manaa bhi kiya tha jo baad main jaakar kaaphi lokapriy hue lekin mujhe iskaa koi afsos nahin he
 ' vishwa cap main do kamjor tiimon ke khilaaf jeetne main pasinaa bahaane vaali bhartiya team ke captain mahendra singh dhoni ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki unke khilaadiyon main josh kii koi kami nahin he lekin josh hone kaa matlab vipakshi ballebaajon se bhidana nahin hota
 Without naming the fast bowler s Sreesanth, Dhoni disagreed that any bowler should try to take on the opposition batsmen
 dhoni se poocha gaya ki unki team apni sarvshereshth farm main pahunchane main josh ko kaise jari rakh sakate hai
 Captain Dhoni said, "the basic mantra to keep the spirit alive is how you get under pressure while playing against better teams
" josh ko aksar galat rup se haav bhav se aanka jaataa he
 He said, there is no enthusiasm to go to the batsman and say something
 balki meraa vishwaas he ki koi bhi ballebaaj yah nahin sunata ki aap kya kar rahe ho kyonki stadium main 50 hajaar log maujuud hote hai
 The negligence of a young man in Chitrakoot has not only turned a wedding ceremony into a mourning
 shanivaar raat mau thana ke tikra gram pradhan kii beti kii shaadi main dancer yahi gaanaa ga rahi thi
 Just then a madman stepped onto the stage and fired three bullets, not one from the tank, causing the dancer's right jaw to fly
 maamla chitrakoot jile ke mau thana kshetra ke tikra gaanv kaa he
 It was the wedding of Sapna, the daughter of the village head, on Saturday night
 varapaksh ne baratiyon or gharatiyon ke manoranjan ke liye hamirpur jile ke bharua kasbe se kuch dancers se bulawaai thi
 Allegedly, Dancer Hina (22) came on stage around 12 pm and as soon as she did 'oi Goriye
 
 Started the dance on the song 'goli Chal Jayegi', a young man from Kaushambi district climbed on the stage waving a gun
 use duulhe ashok ke rishtedaar mithilesh or kamalesh ne stage se neeche utaarne kii koshish kii, lekin usne tamanchey se unpar teen fire jhonk die

 madhya pradesh kii bhopal loksabhaa seat par is baar sabhi kii nigahen hongi
 Because there is going to be a contest here between Digvijay Singh, senior Congress leader and Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh for 10 years, and BJP candidate Sadhvi Pragya of Malegaon blast
 yah muqabla isliye bhi rochak mana ja rahaa he kyonki 16 saal baad digvijay madhya pradesh kii raajnneeti ke centre main hai or unka muqabla unki dhur virdohi sadhvi pragna se hone ja rahaa he
 This contest is considered to be an across-the-board battle for Digvijay at the age of 72, while for Sadhvi Pragya, this is the beginning of politics in a way
 lekin raajnneetik panditon kaa kahana he ki digvijay ke liye yah muqabla baari naa pad jaae
 Because Bhopal Lok Sabha seat is the stronghold of BJP and Congress has not been able to win from here onwards
 aankadon par najar daudai jaae to bhopal main aakhri baar congress 1984 main jiti thi
 After this, BJP has been winning the Lok Sabha elections continuously for 35 years

 shivaraj kii entry bigaadegi digvijay kaa kaam
 
 
 Digvijay Singh's victory in Bhopal Lok Sabha seat can also be difficult because the BJP has commanded the former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan instead of putting any external leader in charge of the Lok Sabha elections in Madhya Pradesh
 sadhvi pragna ke naam kaa elaan hone ke baad shivaraj or sangh active ho gaye or bhopal main tatkaal meeting bhi bulaai or bijepi ke netaaon ko ekajute karnaa shuru kar diya he
 If seen, after Sadhvi Pragya's association with Shivraj, the battle for Digvijay has become more difficult
 kyonki bhopal main shivaraj acchhee khaasi pakad rakhte hai or yahaan tak ki gramin ilaakon main bhi unki paith he
 In such a situation, Sadhvi Pragya can get the benefit of Shivraj's image
 kya kahata he jaateey sameekaran or vidhansabha kaa ganit
 
 
 If we look at the caste equation of Bhopal Lok Sabha seat, then 75 to 80 percent of the Hindus are the voters

 At the same time, Scheduled Caste voters here 14
 83 pratishat hai or anusuchit janajati ke voters 2
 56 percent
 iske alaava yahaan 21 pratishat voters gramin ilaakon main rahete hai or baaki shahari ilaakon main
 In the 2018 assembly elections, the Congress could not win a strong victory in the eight assembly seats under Bhopal Lok Sabha seat
 yahaan abhi aath main se 5 siton par bijepi or 3 siton par congress kaa kabja he
 Here the Congress got 11 percent more votes in the election

 Adopting a child in India is a bit difficult for such citizens
 kyonki bacchon ko pehle bhartiya nagarikon ko hi dene kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 When children are not adopted for two months, they are referred to foreign couples
 fahrren residents ko refer kiye jane vaale bacchon main 60% bachche vishesh jaruraton vaale hote hai or 90% bachche do saal se bade hote hai
 Because the demand for children older than two years is less in Indian couples

 For the first time, the Government of Uttarakhand organized the Dronagiri Track to promote tourism in the Dronagiri area

 However, they acknowledge that this can cause dangerous infection
 aapako bataa den ki brazil main bodyilder is tarah ke khatarnaak injection lekar apni jaan ke saath jabardast khilwaad kar rahe hai
 Many people had to bite their hands and many even died
 arlindo kehete hai, 'meraa dost polhino kii maut isi vajah se hui thi
 He also had injections and i also take him, but he had done the limit
 vah bahut zyada injection letaa tha
 i advise everyone not to use this oil
 maine ab injection yaa isi tarah kii duusari chijen lenaa band kar diya he
 Always wish to start again
 lekin main khud par niyantran karnaa sikh rahaa hum'

 tabhi gym ke ek saathi ne aise tel se unka parichay karavaaya jisase ve apni mansapeshiyon ko vishaal kar apane pratidwandiyon ko maat de sakate the
 He told, 'that friend of Jim gave me oil and said that your body will be made in a few days
 maine syringe main tel bharaa or apni baaju main use laga diya
 My arm swelled immediately
 mujhe us vakt kuch mahasoos nahin hua
 It came like a light wheel, but nothing else
 arlindo kehete hai, 'tel kaa injection lene ke baavjood main pehle kii tarah kasarat karata rahaa
 Most people do not know how to take injections properly
 koi apana haath ganvaa detaa he, kisi ko oparation karwaanaa padataa he to kuch apni jaan hi ganvaa baithte hai'
 Health is severely affected by taking such an injection
 khud arlindo ko apni chintaa sataati he
 He also went to the doctor, but the hospital refused to perform the operation because he had done such a condition himself
 ve kehete hai, 'agar main biimaar paduun yaa meri baanhen fat jaaen to hi main doctor ke paas ja saktaa hum'
 Arlindo started taking injections two years ago and has been in the news in Brazil since then
 lekin unke gharavaalon ko unki bahut phikr rahati he

 According to Pakistan's Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Field General Court Martial sentenced Jadhav to death and the Pakistan Army Chief also confirmed it, ie Jadhav is to be hanged within 90 days
 aisapiaar ne pichley saal ek video jari kiya tha jise usne jadhav kaa kaboolnamaa bataaya tha
 On the basis of this confession to Jadhav, Pakistan is calling him an Indian spy, while India has made it clear that Jadhav was definitely in the Navy but he left this job and started doing business with Iran and Pakistan agencies have kidnapped him from there
 jaaniye, bhartiya naagarik kulbhushan jadhav ke bare main 10 badi batenkulbhushan ke kaboolname kii paak kii kahaneepak kaa daawa he ki kulbhushan jadhav bhartiya nausena main sevarat afasar he or commander he

 paak kaa daawa he ki kulbhushan ne 1987 main neshnal dephence academy join kii or uske baad janvari 1991 main usne indian navy main naukari shuru kii
 In December 2001, when Parliament was attacked, Kulbhushan started offering his services to gather intelligence
 paak daawa kar rahaa he ki kulbhushan mumbai main rahata he or ab bhi vah nausena main sevarat afasar he jo 2022 tak ritair hoga

 video main jadhav kahata dikh rahaa he ki wo ro main sanyukt sachiv anil kumaar gupta ko sidhe report karata he or gupta ke paak khaskar baluchistan chaatr sanghathan main achche contract hai
 Is the action on Kulbhushan linked to the kidnapping of a Pakistani official in Nepal? Kulbhushan, who was arrested while entering Pakistan from Iran, is being quoted in the video that Indian intelligence agency is financing the RAW Baloch movement and helping these agitators Is carrying out anti-national activities in Pakistan, which is causing the loss of life and property of Pakistani citizens
 kulbhushan ne is kathith kaboolname main apane pakade jane kii bhi kahani bataai
 He said that on March 3, 2016, he was trying to sneak into Iran from the Saravan border into Pakistan when Pak authorities caught him
 usne bataaya ki wo baluchistan ke algaavvaadiyon ke saath meeting karne or unhen bhartiya agenciyon ke sandesh pahunchane ke liye pakistan aa rahaa tha
 In this video, Kulbhushan is describing himself as a spy of Raw but is praising the Pakistani agencies for treating him very well and giving him due respect in his treatment
 sartaaj ajij ne mana tha, jadhav ke khilaaf saboot nahindisambar main hi khabar ai thi ki paak pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke videshi maamalon ke salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ne ek meeting main mana tha ki kulbhushan jadhav ke khilaaf paak sarkaar or agenciyon ke paas pukhta saboot nahin hai
 Pakistani TV channel Geo News had reported that Aziz while briefing the mps in the Senate Chamber clearly stated that apart from Jadhav's confession, we have no strong evidence against him
 ajij ne ye bhi kaha tha ki bharat ko die jane vaale dogier main jo saboot hamane rakhe hai, wo kaaphi nahin hai
 It is now the responsibility of the agencies that how much time they take to collect evidence against Jadhav
 kaboolname par uth chuke hai sawalpac ne jadhav ke kaboolname kaa jo video jari kiya he usapar bhi exparts ne sawaal uthaae hai
 This six-minute video has several cuts
 video ko dekhakar kai jagah aisa lagata he ki kulbhushan apni marji se kuch bolne kii bajaay saamne teleprinter par likhaa kuch pard rahaa he
 That is why Kulbhushan's video is not a confession but rather a statement made under pressure has proved to be more
 haalanki paak is mudde par kuch bhi sunne ko taiyaar nahin he
 India has appealed to Pakistan several times to let Kulbhushan meet, but Pakistan has not given permission to Indian agencies

 oops, ye to phuss ho gaibauni kahani or kamjor actinga soha ali khan kii charfutie chhokare Today is the third and last day of the Central Reserve Bank's bi-monthly monetary review meeting
 dopaher baad is baithak main rigerv bank se ummid he ki vah desh main byaaj daron par ahm faisla le
 However, in this meeting, the market, including the central government, is eyeing Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel
 kya maudrik samiksha ke liye teen dinon tak chali baithak ke baad urjit patel arabiai kii swytatta kii maang par jor dete hue ek baar phir kendra sarkaar or rigerv bank ke bich nai khinchataan kii shuruyaat karenge
 The Central Reserve Bank's bi-monthly monetary review becomes a topic of discussion in the business world for three reasons
 pehla, kendriya bank desh main mahangaai ke khatre ko kaise aank rahaa he or doosraa kya kendriya bank ne repo rate (RR) or cash rigerv reshyo (CRR) main badlaav kiya he
 In this monetary review also, the central bank is churning on these issues, but the results of this time will also indicate the current relationship between the Reserve Bank and the central government
 repo rate vah dar he jisapar koi bank kam avadhi ke liye kendriya bank se karj letaa he
 Apart from this, the interest rates in the country are determined by which a businessman or common consumer gets interest on loans and investments from the bank
 cash rigerv reshyo bank ke kul paise kaa vah hissaa he jise vah kendriya bank ke paas rakhata he
 By setting this rate, the Reserve Bank determines the liquidity in the market, that is, it changes the ability of the bank to lend
 SBI kaa paisa bachaane ke liye gujarat, rajasthan samet 5 rajyon main bijli hogi mahangiarabiai kii dwimasik maudrik samiksha kaa nateeja 5 disambar ko aayega
 This time the eyes of the common man along with the business world are also dependent on the decision of the Reserve Bank
 in nateezon se saaf hoga ki kya teen din kii kavayad ke baad rigerv bank or kendra sarkaar ke rishton main kadavaahat main kami ai he yaa phir yah nattejey donon ke bich nai khinchataan kaa aadhaar taiyaar karenge
 The RBI bi-monthly monetary review comprises a total of 6 members
 inamen teen sadsy arabiai ke adhikari hai jinamein rigerv bank governor shaamil hai
 The other three members are nominated by the Central Government along with being economists
 arabiai governor is samiksha baithak main pramukh kirdaar he or teen din kii charchaa ke baad repo rate par faisla lene kaa kaam sankhya bal ke aadhaar par hota he
 Nehru Indira failed, will PM Modi make India P-6? In the review meeting, the Reserve Bank Governor plays a key role in taking the final decision if the decision on the repo rate is on par
 iske saath hi puure maamle kii gopneeyata banaae rakhane ke liye baithak se 7 din pehle or 7 din baad tak samiksha baithak ke dauraan sadasyon ke mat ko saajha nahin kiya jaataa
 However, all members are free to assess key inflation to determine the global situation and repo rate, including the country's economic situation, and a member's assessment is released 7 days after the meeting
 kya hogi byaaj daron main katautee yaa kam hoga siarararthik aankadon ke aadhaar par ek baat saaf he ki is maudrik samiksha baithak ke saamne byaaj dar main katautee na karne ke vah sabhi aadhaar maujuud hai jo pichhali maudrik samiksha baithak ke saamne the
 In October, the inflation in food products in retail inflation was very low below rbi's target
 duusari timahi ke dauraan aarthik vikaas dar ummid se kam rahi or yahaan tak kii khapat ke aankade bhi kamjor hote dikhaai die
 At the time of the last meeting where global crude oil prices were posing a major risk of inflation, the threat appeared to be somewhat subdued during October – November
 pichhali baithak se lekar abtak petrol-dijal kii keemten 25 se 30 fisadi tak kam ho chuki hai
 Apart from this, due to the improvement in the rupee against the dollar, the pressure in the economy has come down during the last two months
 is raahat ke baavjood kachche tel ko lekar chunauti abhi sthaayee taur par nahin tali he
 The CRR is an intriguing subject to the Reserve Bank during monetary review
 iskaa andaja isi se lagata he ki kendriya bank ne 2013 ke baad se siaraar main koi badlaav nahin kiya he
 During the last few months, just as the central government has demanded to increase liquidity in the market and the Reserve Bank and the central government have also seen a tussle about this, one can expect an important decision from the central bank on liquidity
 
 haalanki beete kuch samay se rigerv bank open market oparation (oemo) ke jariye bazaar main taralata ke str main lagaataar ijapha kar rahaa he
 The Reserve Bank will also exercise liquidity through omos during November and December
 is tathy ko dekhte hue maudrik samiksha main siaraar katautee kii sambhaavna aadhi ho jaati he
 Significantly, the reduction in CRR by 50 basis points will provide banks with additional liquidity of Rs 65,000 crore

 In fact, during a press conference, Putin was asked by some reporters whether he was disappointed by Trump's "inexperience"

 He said that the Central Government is nervous due to the public support being received for Advani's visit, hence he has adopted this tactic to cancel the public meeting to disrupt

 According to the news published in the English newspaper 'hindustan Times', during this period, journalists called the daughter-in-law of the Bachchan family 'aishwarya', Jaya was infuriated
 bataaya jaataa he ki usee vakt jaya ne kaha, 'kya aishwarya aishwarya bula rahe ho, tumhaare class main padhati he kya?' jaya kaa jawaab sunakar vahaan maujuud patrkaar hairat main pad gaye
 He could not understand his mistake, because he had called 'aishwarya' as 'aishwarya'

 After marriage, Genelia d'souza is often called 'vahini' (bhabhi's Marathi word) in Mumbai and she has no objection to it
 isi tarah aamir khan 'mistar khan' kahalaaya janaa pasand karte hai
 Saying Salman as 'sallu', another photographer said that Shah Rukh Khan prefers to be called 'khan Sahab' or 'king Khan'
 salmaan khan 'bhai' sambodhan ke saath comfortable hai, par 'sallu bhai' ke saath nahin
 They don't like to call him 'sallu'
 ek or patrkaar ne bataaya ki shatrughna sinha ko pyaar se 'shotgan' kaha jaataa he
 Many times journalists even say 'silent' to get their attentions and it also works
 naam lete hue sammaan jaruri heaishwarya ke masale par lauten to kai senior patrakaron kaa maananaa he ki kai baar naam kis tarah liya ja rahaa he is par bhi sitaron ko aapatti ho jaati he
 If you take the name with respect, then there is no problem in it
 hamen bataaya gaya he ki ab uchhahen 'misses bachchan' kaha ja rahaa he or unke parivaar ko bhi yah pasand he

 In the southern state of Kerala, another meningitis ie Nipah has knocked
 nipah ke badhane sankraman se logon kii chintaaen bad gai hai
 The World Health Organization has warned that there is a high chance of the virus spreading in India and Australia
 kerala kaa kosicode jila puri tarah se prabhavit he
 Twelve infected people have died here, including one nurse Linni Putuseri
 media main maut se purv nurse kii taraf se pati ko likhi gai chitthee logon kaa kaaphi dravit kiya he
 In it, emotional pain was expressed about the children
 rajya sarkaar ne 10 mauton kii pushti kii he
 Union Health Minister JP Nadda has told people that all arrangements have been made to spread the virus to other states
 kerala se sate rajyon ko bhi alert par rakhaa he
 Special trains are being monitored for trains coming to Delhi
 lekin sarkaron ke daavon par aankh moond kar bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, when such epidemic spreads in the country, the claims of governments become fixed deposits and innocent people lose their lives
 isaki vajah he ki ham jameei str par sankramit bimariyon se nipatane ke liye koi dirghakaalik samaadhaan nahin dhundte hai
 Only through rhetoric do you get used to running
 isaki pole isi se khulti he ki kerala main beemaari ke failane kii soochna hamaare swasthya tantra ke paas nahin thi
 We got information about this from the World Health Organization
 nipah se rajya main 12 se adhik logon kii maut ho jaati he, jisamen ek nurse bhi shaamil he
 Before this, were any necessary steps taken? We came to know that Nipah knocked in the state, so what were we doing after one death, then how did more than 12 deaths happen? Despite this, we are giving false assurance to the people of the country to remain worry free, while the ground truth is that we could not save even our nurse
 nipah ek tarah kaa dimagi bukhaar he, jiskaa sankraman teji se failata he
 Medical research shows that it spreads rapidly in humans through bats and pigs
 jo fal chamagadad yaa boar ke sampark main aate hai, unheen ke jariye yah beemaari insaanon tak pahunchati he
 It transports a person into a coma within 48 hours of infection
 isaki jad main jo bhi vyakti aata he use saans lene main dikkat ke saath sir main bhayanak pidaa or tej bukhaar hota he
 The virus is said to have been first identified in 1998 in Malaysia
 us vakt is beemaari kii chapet main 250 se adhik log aae the
 More than 40 percent of the people were killed
 abhi tak beemaari se ladane ke liye desh main kisi bhi prakaar ke tike yaa vaxin kaa izaad nahin hua he
 There is a laboratory in Pune only to detect the virus
 phir ham yah kaise daawa karte hai ki nipah se ladane ke liye sari taiyaariyaan mukammal hai
 As soon as the name of brain fever comes, the picture of Gorakhpur in UP and the lowlands of Bihar starts emerging, for which we have not found a solution till date
 inseflitis yani dimagi bukhaar se ab tak hajaaron mautein ho chuki hai
 But the government is yet to find a complete cure for meningitis
 gorakhpur main saikadon kii sankhya main masuumon kii maut is beemaari se hoti he
 The oxygen scandal of Biradi Medical College will be completely safe in your mind right now
 mastishk fever se oxygen na milane kii vajah se yahaan saikado kii sankhya main bacchon kii maut hui thi, jabaki yah medical kalege upi ke mukhmantri yogi adityanath ke grih janapad main padataa he
 The ground truth is that till date we have not found any solution for encephalitis
 phir duusare dimagi bukhaar se nipatane kii juthi vakaalat kyon karte hai
 For us, there is not only nipple, swine, dengue and other infectious diseases, for which we do not have any effective and quick solution to prevent infection
 sarkarein swasthya par karodon kaa bajet upalabadh karaati hai, lekin vakt aane par ham fail ho jate hai
 There are thousands of deaths due to dengue in the country, but we do not have any concrete policy to prevent its recurrence
 ham naam badal kar kaaryastylee nahin badal sakate hai
 We made the Planning Commission the NITI Aayog
 lekin kya niti ayog is tarah kii sankramit bimariyon ke nipatane liye koi thos upaay lekar aayaa
 Governments set up separate commissions in the health sector
 is tarah jo swatantra rup se kaam karen or duniya main failane vaali aisi sankramit bimariyon ko desh failane hi na de
 The terror of infection has to be understood
 hamaari praathamikta main raajnneeti nahin rajdharm hona chahie
 In the era of modern politics, during elections, political parties make huge promises, but after coming to power their policies change
 janata ke saath kiye gaye vaayade bhuulaa die jate hai
 In Tantra, Gan goes on the margins
 raajnneetik dal manamafik faisle lete hai, jisaki vajah se aam logon kii ummiido par pani phir jaataa he
 It is a matter of ground that innocent people are killed every year due to diseases transmitted in the country
 bimariyon hamale or media main khinchaai ke baad ek baad sarkaar jaagti he ike baad vah phir gahari neend main hoti he
 She does not want a temporary solution to the problem, due to which the problems of people increase
 sarkari aspataalon main saste ilaaj or sankramit bimariyon se bachane ke lok lubhaavan baaten kii jaati hai, lekin dharaatal par is tarah kaa kuch nahin dikhataa he
 Poor people and the afflicted people give up in the absence of treatment and medical care
 fefda hi nahin, dhumrapaan se sharir ko hota he ek or bada nuksaanajra sochie, yah maut un pariwaron ke liye kitni peedaadaayak hoti he
 Just now Nipah is under attack, tomorrow Japanese fever and dengue are left standing
 tabhi koi na koi videshi dharti se jaanaleva virus hamalaa kar degaa or ham sirf nijaat ke liye khokhli nitiyaan hi banaate rahenge
 Diabetic patients eat these fruits, they will get many benefits, now is the time when separate research institutes and commissions should be set up to improve health services
 jamini str kii nitiyaan banaai jaaen
 Permanent solution should be found to get rid of infected diseases
 sarkaar ko apni naitik jimmedaari samajni hogi
 Proper development of health facilities will have to be done in the country

 But during the debate, if the dignity and dignity of the house remains, then we will be able to keep our point more firmly

 PM Modi said that on March 8, only women mps should be given a chance to speak in the House

 He said, "if the Tamil Nadu government talks about releasing the killers of Rajiv Gandhi, then nothing could be worse
" desh kii akhandta ke liye aise logon ko reeha karne liye aae patr kaa sarkaar ko jawaab hi nahin dena chahie

 Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in the Lok Sabha that the decision of the Supreme Court is paramount
 unhone kaha, 'tamilnadu sarkaar kaa khat mila he, usapar gaur kiya ja rahaa he
 It is our constitutional obligation to accept the decision of the Supreme Court
 ' Northern Railway has said that in the first half of this financial year, there has been an increase of 11 per cent in the number of passengers traveling without tickets and wrongly as compared to last year
 rojaanaa 1432 betikat yatri pakade gaefirozepur rail mandal ke mandal rail prabandhak anuj prakaash ne kaha ki is saal maujuuda vitt varsh kii pehali chamahi main railway adhikariyon ne ausatan rojaanaa 1432 betikat yatriyon ko pakada jo isi samay pichley saal kii apeksha 142 adhik he
 Bettick passengers increased by 11 percent
 Prakash said that during the same period last year, railway officials caught an average of 1290 passengers traveling in the division daily without tickets or wrong tickets
 is saal isamen 11 fisadi se adhik kaa ijaphahua he jo chintajanak he
 More than 11 crore fine was charged, he also said that from April to September this year, two lakh 57 thousand 773 passengers were caught traveling wrongly while last year the figure was two lakh 32 thousand 183

 input language vitt mantri pranab mukherjee ne kaha he ki desh ke 161 jile sookhe se prabhavit hai
 He said there has been a 20 per cent reduction in sowing
 unhone kaha ki yah sookhaa sadi kaa sabase bada sookhaa he
 Drought marks on the government's forehead also put a strain on the forehead of the government
 kuch din pehle hi pradhanmantri ne bhi kaha tha zaruri saamaan kii keemte bad sakati hai
 Now Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has also accepted that a large part of the country has been hit by drought
 vitt mantri ke mutabik desh main maujuuda halaat kaaphi chintaa janak hai
 This year, 20 per cent kharif sowing has come down and 161 districts are in the grip of drought
 yani aane vaale dinon desh main anaj or baaki khaane pine ke saamaan kii kami ho sakati he
 This country has witnessed the worst drought in 1987
 us samay pine kaa pani or pashuon ke liye chaara railway ke zarie pahuchaya gaya tha
 We have experience dealing with this situation
 ye zaruri nahin ki bahut zyaata is chintaa vishay banaaya jaae
 The 6 percent growth rate will be difficult
 The Minister has also made it clear that the impact of the drought is going to affect the growth rate of the country and this year it will not be so easy for the economy to achieve the target of 6 percent
 growth kya rahegi philhal kahana mushkil he, lekin isapar puure samay nazar rakhni hogi
 But we will have to accept whatever the situation unfolds
 abhi puri tarah saamne nahin aayaa sookhe kaa asarvitt mantri kehete he ki sukhe kii vajah se ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he, or sarkaar ke paas isse nipatane ke liye kai vikalp maujuud hai
 But the question is how to accept the government
 abhi to sukhe kaa asar puri tarah bazaar par padaa bhi nahi he, to zaruri saamaan kii keemten aasmaan chhu rahi hai
 When the real impact of the drought will be on the market, do not know where the prices will go
 lekin is bich ek raahat kii baat ye he ki punjab or haryana main kam barish ke baavjood buaai par khaas asar nahin padaa he or ye hua sirf is liye he kyonki in ilaakon main jamini pani kaa str baaki rajyon se behatar he
 The Prime Minister convened a meeting on the drought
 Prior to this, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a meeting with Vijay Kelkar, Chairman of the 13th Finance Commission and Sudha Pillai, Secretary, Planning Commission and is believed to discuss the drought situation in different parts of the country
 yah baithak mahatvapurn maani ja rahi he kyonki kharif fasalon par kharaab monsoon ke prabhaav or aavashyak khaadya padaatharen ke badhate daamon se ladane ke liye sarkaar rajyon ko zyada sansaadhan uplabdh karaane kii yojana bana rahi he
 On Monday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived to address an election public meeting in Mau of Purvanchal, one thing that was particularly emphasized in his speech was the appeal of the people to vote for the government of absolute majority
 pradhanmantri ne kahaaki sapa or basapa ab sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin hai isliye ye donon raajnneetik dal chaahate hai ki rajya main trishanku vidhansabha rahe or kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ko purna bahumat na mili
 He said that to demolish this plan of both parties, people should vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party and form a clear majority government in the state
 modi ne somvaar ko upi main kii raily-yahaan padhein reportlekin 300 ke paar vaale naare se saje manch par bolte hue pradhanmantri shaayad yah sthapit kar gaye ki philhal chunaav kisi ek raajnneetik dal ke haath main nahin he
 Political analysts believe that if the BJP had a better position, the Prime Minister would not have said the hung assembly
 manch se ek spasht bahumat vaali sarkaar kaa aahwan karke pradhanmantri ne saaf kar diya ki jis tarah kii raajnneetik sthiti or matdaan abhi tak rajya main dikhaai de rahe hai, wo kisi party ko spasht bahumat kii ore nahin le ja rahe hai
 And on this basis, the Prime Minister was demanding a majority government
 pradhanmantri ne apane bhaashan main ek-ek charan ke matdaan ko samajhaate hue yah sthapit karne kii koshish kii ki kaise janadesh donon hi kshetreey dalon ko purna bahumat kii ore nahin le ja rahaa he
 At the same time expressed the belief that the BJP is continuously making gains and going ahead
 pradhanmantri ne logon ko yah bhi samajhane kaa prayaas kiya ki purna bahumat kii sarkaar bananaa kyon zaruri he
 He said that today India is cheering in every corner of the world and the reason for this is the government of absolute majority in the center after 30 years
 aisi hi sarkaar agar soobe main bhi bani to vikaas hona tay he
 a large number of Union ministers and mps, mlas were present on the dais with the Prime Minister
 aisa hi jamaavada banaras main bhi he jahaan kai kendriya mantri or bhaajapa ke rashtriya str ke padaadhikari deraa daale hue hai
 Actually, the fear of not getting majority is haunting both the Prime Minister and his party and that is why the BJP is now engaged in throwing all the strength for the rest of the phases
 pradhanmantri bhi logon ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai ki hang assembly ke bajaay spasht bahumat ke liye matdaan karen
 The BJP needs a big edge in these phases to realize the dream of power and other political parties are challenging it
 isi chintaa main ab modi kaa nayaa brahmastra trishanku vidhansabha vaali baat ban gaya he

 dilli ke buraadi main hui 11 logon kii maut ke maamle main esadm kii report bada khulaasa hua he
 According to the report, the deceased family was involved in Tantra-mantra and was a victim of extreme superstition
 isse pehle jis tarah maut se jude tathy saamne aa rahe hai, usase bhi tasviir saaf hoti ja rahi he ki parivaar ko andhvishwaas jakadaaa hua tha
 Police in search of Baba Actually in this whole case, Crime Branch of Delhi Police is now looking for that Baba
 jo is parivaar ko moksh ke liye maut kii raah upaay main bataaya
 Because in the situation in which all the bodies were recovered and then the things written in the register found from the temple of the house are coming out
 usase lagata he ki parivaar ko kaaphi dinon se koi gumraah kar rahaa tha, kyonki baraamad register main 2015 se parivaar lagaataar nots likh rahaa tha
 Police is investigating the call details of all the family members
 is puure maamle main chaunkaanewaali baat he ki buraadi ke parivaar ne bilkul usee andaaz main maut ko chunaa jaisaa pehle se register main darj tha
 It was written in the register as to who would hang where and exactly the same was done
 police ko lagata he ki bhaatia parivaar ko mauksh prapti ke liye kaaphi dinon se prerit kiya ja rahaa tha
 The manner of death, day of death and time of death are clearly written on the pages of the register
 register ko dikot karne main juty pulicepulice ab register ke ek-ek panne or usamen likhi ek ek baat ko dicode karne main lagi he
 Many important questions are at the center of police investigations
 jaise register main jo kuch likhaa gaya he wo kisne likhaa, kya vaaki register main parivaar kii maut kii script likhi he, kya is maut ke peeche tantra mantra he, or kya ye police ko uljhane kaa koi tarika to nahin
 The mystery of death in 11 pipes? Actually the superstition connection of 11 deaths is also coming to the fore in Delhi, 11 pipes coming out of the same house in which the 11 dead bodies are found are surprising everyone
 kisi ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki is tarah ke 11 pipe kyon niklaa hua he
 In the photo accompanying the news, you can see how 11 pipes have come out of the house
 in 11 pipon main se 7 pipe mude hue hai jabaki 4 sidhe hai
 This pipe in the house of Bhatia family is seen to be connected with death
 kyonki ghar main kul pipe lage hai jo kisi istemaal ke liye nahin lagaae gaye hai
 On seeing the pipe, it is clear that the family had a superstition
 kyonki ghar main maranevaali kii sankhya 11 he or pipe bhi 11 lage hai
 Apart from this, 7 are women and 4 are male
 jabaki ghar kii diwaar main lage 11 pipon main se 7 mude hai or 4 sidhe hai
 Expressing its national aspirations, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday announced that it will contest the 'maximum' seats of most states in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and will release its first list of candidates in the next 10-15 days
 vahiin, dilli ke mukhyamantri or party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki vah loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladenge or sirf party ke ummidavaaron ke liye prachaar karenge
 However, amid speculation about Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal being the prime ministerial candidate for AAP, senior party leader Prashant Bhushan made it clear in his talks with reporters that a decision would be taken only after the outcome of the Lok Sabha elections
 'aap' kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii do divasiy baithak ke baad bhushan ne yah elaan kiya
 Kejriwal and all the senior leaders of the party were present in this meeting to be held tomorrow bhushan ne kaha, ''aap zyaadaatar rajyon main adhiktam siton par loksabhaa chunaav ladegi
 We will announce most of our candidates by the end of mid-february or many more next month
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya kejariwal ko 'aap' kaa pradhanmantri ummidavaar ghoshit kiya jayega, is par unhone kaha ki is babat aaj faisla nahin kiya gaya he
 Bhushan said, 'arvind Kejriwal is the biggest leader of the party but we have not decided on the name of our prime ministerial candidate
 ye hamaare liye ahmiyat nahin rakhata ki pradhanmantri ummidavaar koun banegaa
 ' 'aap' ke varisht netaa sanjay singh ne kaha, 'aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye party ke ummidavaaron kii pehali suchi 10 se 15 dinon main jari kar di jaaegi
 The procedure adopted in the selection of candidates for the Delhi Assembly elections will be followed in the Lok Sabha elections as well
 ' Singh said that the party will contest elections from those states where its structure is good and where it will get honest candidates
 'aap' ke is netaa ne kaha, 'agle ek maheene ke dauraan party har rajya main baithak kar loksabhaa ummidavaaron ke naam tay karegi
 Those facing criminal and corruption charges and questions about their moral character will not be given tickets
 ' Sanjay Singh said that like the Delhi Assembly elections, the party will have a separate manifesto for every parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 yah puche jane par ki kya 'aap' bhaajapa ke shahari vot kaategi or narendra modi kii pradhanmantri pad kii aakankshaon ko nuksaan pahunchaayegi, is par singh ne kaha ki party congress or bhaajapa kaa vikalp banakar ubhari he or vah kisi party ko 'phaayde' yaa 'nuksaan' ke liye chunaav nahin lard rahi he
 Singh said, 'rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi are not electoral issues for us
 ham logon kii samasyaayein khatm karne ke liye yahaan aae hai
 'bhushan said,' Like people in urban areas, people in rural areas are also keen on 'AAP'
 kai aisi jagahen hai jahaan gaanvon ke log zyada utsuk hai
 ' unhone kaha ki log ab congress or bhaajapa kaa vikalp chaahate hai or 'aap' janandolan he, koi raajnneetik party nahin
 Bhushan said, "AAP" believes that the government should run according to the aspirations of the people
 ' loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye gathit party kii do sadasyeey up-samiti ke sadsy singh ne kaha ki party ke bhavishya ko lekar rajyon main bhi utsukata he or badi taadaad main log 'aap' main shaamil hona chaahate hai
 The party has already invited applications from candidates wishing to contest the Lok Sabha elections

 Former Bharatiya Janata Party general secretary KN Govindacharya said on Tuesday that Lal Krishna Advani became the party's prime ministerial candidate because the party lacked talented leaders
 unhone kaha ki adwani hindootv andolan ke netaa nahin hai, saath hi vartmaan aarthik uthal-puthal ke liye purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko doshi tehraaya
 Govindacharya, once a favorite of Advani, said in an interview that Advani is good for the party, but not necessarily for the country
 govindacharya ke anusaar aagaamee sansadeey chunaav main bhaajapa satta main nahin aa sakegi
 It is known that Govindacharya had resigned from BJP in 2000 and he went on leave for self-determination and study
 haal hi main vah uma bharti kii party bhartiya jan shakti ke sawesarva ke rup main raajnneeti main phir sakriy hue hai
 Govindacharya said that Advani has become the wrong leader of a right movement
 unki kathani or kerani main baari antar he
 Commenting on the statement made on Mohammad Ali Jinnah during his visit to Pakistan, Govindacharya said that if he had the courage, he would have split from the party, and whatever happens, would have maintained his statement
 jinna vivaad ke samay maine unhen ek sandesh bheja tha or poocha tha ki kya aapke paas apane siddhanton par chalane va aam jan ke mudde uthaane kaa saahas he
 Aware of the looming threat on Pakistan, former President Pervez Musharraf said on Sunday that the country's leadership should pay attention to the concerns of the world community about the security situation but no one should preach about the specific course of action
 
 saudi arab kii yatra par ravaanaa hone se pehle musharraf ne yahaan samvaadadaataaon se baatcheet main kaha ki desh khatre main he tathaa yadi ham maamuli or puraane muddon main uljhe rahe to samasyaayein khadi ho jaaengi
 He said that the issue is very serious
 duniya main har koi pakistan ke mudde ko gambhirtha se le rahaa he
 Everyone is trying to decide the course of action
 musharraf ne kaha ki pakistan ko karrwai kii apni disha tay kerani chahie taaki desh ko maujuuda samasyaon se ubaara ja sake
 He said that we should be clear that no one preaches to us the direction of action
 hamen karrwai kii apni disha tay kerani padegi or desh ko bachaana hoga tathaa ise pragati kii disha main aage badhanaa hoga

 On the pretext of traveling to Delhi, an independent India organization camped in Mathura's Jawahar Bagh for just a few hours that more than two years passed, but the camp did not take off
 jawahar baag par kabja kar liya gaya
 The organization started running parallel government
 yahaan kanoon kaa nahin, bas sanghathan kaa hi raaj chalata tha
 That is, when Jawahar Bagh was empty after a face-to-face bloody collision, it got such a huge stock of weapons in the back that even the policemen themselves were torn apart
 kai baar jahaan ek chaaku ke milane bhar se police arms act kii sakht dhaaraon ke tahat logon ko giraftaar kar jail bhej detii he, vahiin bhagwaan krishna kii janmabhumi mathura ke bichon-bich saalon se jame ek dharmik sanghathan ke log dharm-karm kii aad main hathiyaaron kaa jakhira ikattha karte rahe or sabakuch jaanate hue bhi police prashasan unhen roak nahin saki
 Name it intelligence failure or carelessness of deliberately turning away from the truth
 satyagrah ke binar tale dangai hathiyaar ikattha karte rahe
 The work of the Bharatiya legal ideological satyagrahi institution is hooliganism, illegal capture and persecution of those living nearby
 hairaan karne vaali baat ye ki is sanstha ne dilli main dharna-pradarshan ke naam par mathura main adda jamaaya or do saal tak jawaharbagh main jame rahe
 What Satyagrahis of Mathura annihilated in one day is too heavy for the police to digest

 Ashram became Arms Depot! Small bunkers were built and the trees were literally hidden
 yahi vajah he ki kareeb 15 ghante baad bhi asalhon ke milane kaa silsilaa abhi puri tarah rukaa nahin he
 The presence of such a large number of realities only proves what was going on in the minds of the people who occupied Jawahar Bagh
 wo apni maangen manwaane ke liye kitne arajak ho gaye the
 How their leader was running a parallel government
 police par kiya hamalaashayad yahi vajah he ki guuruuvaar kii shaam kareeb saadhe chaar baje police jawahar baag kii dahalij par pahunchi hi thi ki baag main kabiz logon ne sidhe pulisavaalon par hamalaa kar diya
 The attack is not like this but with bullets and bombs
 mahilaayein hathiyaaron ke saath pedo ke upar chadhi hui thim or lagaataar pulisavaalon ko nishaanaa bana kar firing kar rahi thi
 This occupation of Jawahar Bagh began in March 2014
 madhya pradesh se is sanghathan ke logon ne dilli ke liye ek satyagrah yatra kii shuruyaat kii thi
