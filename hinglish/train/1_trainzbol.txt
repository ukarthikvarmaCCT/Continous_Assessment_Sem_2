sarhad par golibari jari thi, phir bhi unhone pakistan ke bare main ek shabd nahin kaha
 You can see how they are setting a new agenda
 ve pakistan ke saath baatcheet dobaaraa shuru karnaa chaahate hai or unhen yah katai manjuur nahin ki koi dost yaa dushman isamen taang adaae
 Listen to his Dubai speech again and note how many times he made the crowd cheer the "crown Prince" there
 jaraa sochie, kya yah baat saamaanya maani ja sakati he ki bharat kaa pradhanmantri kisi videshi dharti par rah rahe or kaam kar rahe bharatiyon kii bheed se vahaan ke shaasha kii jai jayakaar karwaae? yah koi sanyog nahin tha ki islamic rajya kii prashansa main naare lagane vaali adhikansh bheed hinduon kii thi
 It is different that Doordarshan's cameras and Modi's image management destroyed the occasion by repeatedly showing Bohra Muslims standing in traditional costumes in a corner
 jahaan tak mujhe yaad padataa he, aise do maukey rahe hai jab kisi bhartiya netaa ne bhartiya bheed kaa istemaal videshi netaa kii saraahna main naare lagavane ke liye kiya ho
 The first time this happened was when Nehru came to Ramlila Maidan in 1955 with Khrushchev and Bulganin
 duusari baar aisa tab dikhaa jab narsingh raav ne lakhanu ke imambara main 1994 main rafasanjani kaa bhaashan karavaaya, jis vakt babari jakhm hare the
 However, there is a difference between the two events
 khrushchev jab bharat aae the tab nehru raaj kaa samaajawaadee charan apane charam par tha, lihaaja donon ke bich ek vaicharik najdiki thi
 There were Muslims in the crowd chanting for Rafsanjani, or they were all Shia Muslims
 rafasanjani ne apane bhaashan main jo kuch kaha, vah mere khyaal se hamaare itihaas kii sabase chaalaak kootnithik kamyaabi thiah bhartiya musalmaan bharat ke dharmanaripeksh tantra main mahfuj hai
 This in itself underscores the unique relationship between India and Iran, despite that it has been intermittently affected by Pakistan, sanctions and similar sporadic disruptions
 modi ke aalochakon ko shikaayat thi ki ve ab tak kisi islamic desh kii yatra par nahin gaye hai
 a trip to Bangladesh or Central Asian republics, a Muslim-majority country, is fine, but they did not go to any real Islamic country
 ve isi kii taiyaari main lage the, lekin unhen aisa kar ke koi khanaapurti nahin kerani thi
 They wanted to make every tactical start possible
 bharat ke sabase glaniheen hindu pradhanmantri ke bataur unhone apane chaahane vaale 50,000 or zyaadaatar hinduon kii bheed se videshi dharti par ek muslim shaasha kii saraahna main jo naare lagavaaye, yahi baat unki takat, kaushal or aaveg kaa saboot he
 Despite all these great achievements, the question arises why his government's performance is so poor? Why have their undisputed and vast plans stagnated from cleaning the Ganges to Swachh Bharat and Make in India? If you forget them once by changing the standards of mathematical arithmetic and fake methods, the question arises, why the economic growth is not improving at all? Why is the Prime Minister's rapid and immediate decision to buy two squadron Rafale aircraft stuck in formalities? Giriraj Singh, Why are they allowing some slipped people like Sakshi Maharaj and Gajendra Chauhan to make headlines? After all, how do they make the strategic mistake of introducing a new land acquisition law through an ordinance overnight? Why does it feel about this government sending a notice to some news channels (some of which were ridiculous) of Yakub Memon's coverage that it has waged a war against the media? Why is the home ministry citing "national security" for Sun Group's media license revocation? Why has his CBI transformed Teesta Setalvad into a "threat to national security", should he be a relative of Dawood? Even if they sent a few people to jail on the basis of dislike or even closed some media institutions for some time, they would lose all these battles on the level of emotion
 chatur, aavegpurn, taqatvar, aatmavishvaas yukt netaa jo achche vaktaa bhi hon, itane chote-chote masalon par apni urja or saakh ko nahin ganvaate hai
 Could it be that despite all these qualities, there is also a weakness in them that is found in all other leaders, due to which they are deprived of becoming truly great: to attract such people, such talents to themselves Inability, anorexia or lack of humility, which are beyond their normal range of politics and ideology? Or the inability to bring such sensible and orthodox people into their ambit who dare to speak the truth in front of power? For example, someone who could tell them that the suit was good, but the idea of wearing it was bad
 koi aisa, jo unase yah kah paata ki monsoon satr main sansad kaa maahaul vastav main khiz paidaa karne vaala tha, phir bhi behatar hota yadi loksabhaa ke netaa hone ke naate ve vipaksh ke uthaae muddon kaa swatah sangyaan lekar unka jawaab de dete
 They may not have agreed to this, but by doing so, they have lost their Iqbal as Prime Minister
 koi aisa vyakti unke daayre main hota jo unke grih or soochna prasaaran mantralay ko cheta saktaa ki media kii aazaadee se chhedchhad mat karo, kyonki vaise bhi sarkaar or party ko is maamle main andeh kii najar se hi dekha jaataa he
 There must have been someone in this system who would repeatedly tell them to speak to Ram Vilas Paswan not to file a class action suit on Nestlé in the Maggi controversy case and stay relaxed
 aap ek taqatvar or samprabhu sarkaar hai, aap apane ganraajya ke khaadya suraksha kanoonon ke hisaab se nestle par niyantran rakhte hai, aapke paas prayogshaalaayein hai, to har cheez kaa pehle pareekshan karvaa lijie or yadi aapako tab kuch bhi galat yaa aapraadhik pataa chalata he to dand dijie
 But what does class action suit mean? This is not a sign of being powerful, it is just stupid
 aap kah sakate hai ki pradhanmantri ke paas vakt kahaan hota he
 Apart from these things he has all the serious work
 agar aisa he, tab in masalon par aapaki sarkaar ladkadaa kyon rahi he? ek aadmi kaa faujee risaala sunne main to bahut shandaar jaan padataa he, lekin apane peeche asli fouj khadi kiye bagaiyr aap jang nahin jeet sakate

 chunki yah adhyadesh he, isliye kanoon kaa rup dene ke liye sarkaar ko ise 6 maheene ke bheetar sansad ke donon sadanon main paas karwaanaa hoga
 The government had decided to bring this ordinance, bypassing political opposition
 yah duniya kaa sabase bada kaarykram hoga jiske tahat 67 fisadi aabaadi ko 6 karod 20 lakh ton chaaval, gehun or saadhaaran anaaj muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega

 However, Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar has expressed concern about the loss to the exchequer many times
 isse pehle congress ke media prabharee ajay maakan ne press conference karke food bill ke phaayde ginaae
 He claimed that after the implementation of the Food Security Ordinance, there will be no starvation in the country and the problem of malnutrition among children and women will be eliminated

 What the rest of the political Dalbjp president Rajnath Singh has termed this ordinance as a political gimmick
 unhone kaha ki unki party vidheyak ko paas karwaanaa chaahati he lekin iske liye sansad main bahes or kuch sanshodhan jaruri the
 Rajnath said, 'the monsoon season is probably starting from the third week of July, then what was the need to do it in a hurry
 'vahiin, sipiem netaa vrinda karaat ne bhi sansad ke satr se pehle adhyadesh laakar vidheyak paas karaane kii aalochana kii he
 He called it contempt of Parliament and injustice to the common people

 These are points of criticism 1

 2
 iske lagu hone ke baad anaaj ke bazaar par food korporation of india jaisi sarkari agenciyon kaa dabadabaa ho saktaa he, jisase nijee vyapaaree bazaar se baahar ho jaaenge
 3
 chote kisaan jo ab tak nijee upyog kaa anaaj khud ugaate the, sabsidi kaa anaaj kharidne or paisa banane ke liye duusari fasalon kii ore aakarshith ho sakate hai
 This may affect production

 karnataka main congress ke chehre mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne chamundeshwari se vidhansabha chunaav ke liye namakan patr daakhil kiya he
 Before the nomination, Siddaramaiah and his son visited the Chamundeshwari temple and offered prayers
 siddharmaiya chamundeshwari se kai baar chunaav jeet chuke hai
 Siddaramaiah said that i am a Hindu but Amit Shah is calling me anti-hindu, while Shah himself is not a Hindu, he is a Jain, which is a separate religion
 unhone kaha ki amit shah hinduon ke naam par lagaataar jhooth bol rahe hai
 Siddaramaiah said that i believe in humanity and follow the same values
 unhone kaha ki bijepi lagaataar daliton kaa apmaan kar rahi he or samvidhan ko khatm karne main juty he
 The BJP does not know the Constitution
 bijepi ke mantri anant kumaar hegade kehete hai ki ham samvidhan ko badal denge
 BJP president Amit Shah does nothing against him, while such a minister should be dismissed from the cabinet
 siddharmaiya vidhansabha chunaav main ek seat se chunaav ladenge yaa phir do jagahon se, ise lekar tasviir abhi saaf nahin he
 Currently, he has filed his nomination from Chamundeshwari on Friday
 duusari seat badami vidhansabha se chunaav ladane par shanivaar ko faisla karenge
 The Congress has announced the name of Doctor Devraj Patil for the badami, but the party has now barred him from filing nominations
 siddharmaiya ne apane raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat chamundeshwari se kii thi
 He has won this seat five times
 siddharmaiya ne 2008 main varuna vidhansabha seat ko chunaav tha
 He then vacated Varuna's seat for his son
 maujuuda samay main chamundeshwari seat par jedies ke jiti devgauda kaa kabja he
 Devgowda is applying full power to defeat Siddaramaiah from here
 itnaa hi nahin jedies pramukh echdi kumaraswami bhi siddharmaiya ko gherne ke liye teen dinon tak chamundeshwari main chunaav prachaar kar chuke hai
 However, the BJP has not yet announced its candidate from here
 chamundeshwari kaa siyaasi samikaranchamundeshwari vidhansabha seat par 72 hajaar vokkaliga or 40 hajaar lingayat ke virshaiv samudaay kaa vot hai
 Apart from this, more than 60 percent of the voters are from OBC, minority and Dalit communities
 rajyasabha ke liye 16 rajyon kii 58 siton par namakan bharne kii prakriya puri ho chuki he
 All candidates filed their leaflets on the last day of nomination on Monday, March 12
 lekin congress netaa rajeev shukla ke saath jo hua, wo behad hairaan karne vaala he
 The party gave him an opportunity to send him to the Rajya Sabha again, but time did not support him
 media reports ke mutabik, somvaar ko congress party ne aakhri vakt main rajeev shukla ko rajyasabha chunaav ke liye namakan bharne ke nirdesh die
 He was to file nomination from Gujarat
 media reports ke mutabik, dopaher kareeb 12 baje rajeev shukla ko party kii taraf se ahmedabad pahunchakar namakan bharne ke liye kaha gaya
 As soon as the party high command got the green signal, Rajiv Shukla made preparations to go to Ahmedabad
 kyonki namakan kaa vakt dopaher 3 baje khatm ho rahaa tha, isliye rajeev shukla ne dilli se ahmedabad pahunchane ke liye chartered vimaan kaa intjaam kiya
 However, even Rajiv Shukla's efforts did not reach him in Gujarat
 darasal, unhone jaldi pahunchane ke liye chartered vimaan kii vyavastha to kar lee thi, lekin dilli hawaii adde pahunche to pataa chalaa ki landing ke liye ahmedabad airport se anumati nahin mili he
 This happened because the construction work was going on at Ahmedabad Airport and it was closed till 7 pm
 rathva ne aakhri samay main bharaa namakangujrat kii chaar rajyasabha siton ke liye bijepi or congress donon ne teen-teen ummidavaar maidan main utaare hai
 In Gujarat, BJP has fielded former MLA Kriti Singh Rana as the third candidate after Purushottam Rupala and Mansukh Mandavia
 vahiin congress ne ami yagnik or narayan rathva ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 Rathwa reached the returning officer in Ahmedabad at 2
30 pm on Monday and filed his nomination papers
 yani unhone antim samay main namakan patr bharaa
 However, when asked the reason for the delay, he cited delay in getting the necessary documents
 teen baar rajyasabha sadsy rahe rajeev shuklabta den ki patrakarita ke jariye raajnneeti main kadam rakhane vaale rajeev shukla is baar rajyasabha main dikhaai nahin denge
 Rajiv Shukla has been a Rajya Sabha member for three consecutive terms
 pehali baar 2000 main upi se rajyasabha ke sadsy bane
 He then reached Rajya Sabha in 2006 and 2012 from Kota in Maharashtra

 Pujara was playing for 206 when captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni declared India's first innings ended by scoring 521 for eight wickets
 is tarah se england ko duusare din 18 over khilne ko mili jisamen usne 41 ran ke andar teen wicket ganvaa die

 Born in Rajkot, 24-year-old Pujara spent almost eight and a half hours at the crease and meanwhile hit 21 fours, facing 389 balls

 kampton shuru se hi shaat lagane se parhez kar rahe the
 He could not understand Ashwin's off-break, which came out between his bat and pad and uprooted the middle stump
 ojha ne jald hi bharat ko duusari safalataa bhi dilava di
 Nightwatchman James Anderson (2) wanted his ball to go up and play but it bounced off the inside edge and Gautam Gambhir, standing at short leg, dived and converted it into a catch
 jonathan traat khaataa bhi nahin khol paae
 He could not understand Ashwin's flight taking the ball which took the edge of his bat and went to Pujara as an easy catch
 dhoni ne aakhir main yuvaraj ko bhi gend thamayi jinhone england ke khilaaf abhyaas match main paanch wicket liye the
 The England captain now rests on captain Alastair Cook (22 not out) and veteran Kevin Pietersen (six not out)

 com / 2xm0eisdjq Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain's difficulties are not being named
 iskar vibhaag ne satyendra jain ko ek or notice jari kiya he
 The Income Tax Department claimed to have found evidence of Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain's relationship with hawala businesses
 26 disambar ko iti ne jain ko pehla notice jari kiya tha
 The notice was sent to Satyendar Jain by the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax Department in Delhi
 iskar vibhaag ne ye notice saal 2011-12 ke liye bheja tha
 According to the information received, Jain had stated his annual income of Rs 8 lakh this year
 jabaki vibhaag kii jaanch main paaya gaya ki jain kii companiyon ke karmchaariyon ne kolkata kehvala kaarobaariyonko nakad raashi pahunchaai thi
 Jain, however, dismisses all these allegations outright
 vahiin dilli kemukhyamantri arvind kejarivalaur unki team ise centre sarkaar kii sajeesh qaraar de rahe hai
 On the other hand, before the Punjab elections, many such allegations are also expected
 dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne bataaya ki pehle notice kaa jawaab jain de chuke hai
 Now the second notice will be answered
 naksali apniranneetior gorilla yuddh ke taur-tareekon main bada pherbadal karne kii taiyaari main hai
 The naxalites are going to change their code to avoid action by security forces
 ab ve military se milti-julati hare rang kii vardi nahin pahanenge taaki suraksha balon kii najaron se batch saken or apni gatividhiyon ko anjaam de saken
 This information came from a Intelligence report
 yah ranneeti un sabhi ilaakon main aajamaane kii taiyaari he jahamaovadaka garh he or jahaan naksali apane adde banaate hai
 It is reported in Aaj Tak's handheld intelligence report that Maoists are planning to recruit women and children in large numbers to gather intelligence
 mahilaon or bacchon kii sankhya badhaakar maovadi apane ilaakon main intelegence network chust karne kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 Dress made trouble The security forces have often been worried that Naxalites dress like them
 is kaaran oparation ke dauraan unhen pahchaanane main dikkat aati he
 Looking at the last few incidents, in Chhattisgarh, Odisha as well as Jharkhand, many Naxalites were seen in CRPF uniform, shoes and caps
 khaas baat yah he ki yah dress bazaar main aasaani se uplabdh he jiskaa phayda naksali uthaate hai or suraksha balon kii karrwai par pani pherane ke liye aise kapadon kaa istemaal karte hai
 While the security forces have expressed concern over the green dress to protect themselves from the Naxalites, the Naxalites have also appealed to their cadres not to wear this dress
 naksaliyon ne apni military kaman ko chhodkar baaki sabhi sadasyon ko nirdesh jari karte hue kaha he ki ve maovadi dress na pahanen
 This instruction is also for cadres carrying out violent activities
 nirdesh main kaha gaya he ki naksali cader hameshaa sada vesh main rahen taaki koi unhen na pahchaan sake
 According to the report, recently, about one and a half dozen women and children have been included in their group by Naxalite commanders and they are getting them working to gather intelligence against the security forces
 yahi nahin, naksaliyon ne yah bhi kaha he ki jahaan par suraksha bal bade str par movement kar rahe hai us ilaake main apana movement kam karen
 With this, if Naxalites are fought in the village areas, then they should roam like ordinary men
 is tarah kii intelligence report khufia vibhaag ko mili he jiske aadhaar par suraksha balon ko alert kiya gaya he ki civil dress main naksali aakar suraksha balon ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 This may cause considerable damage to the security forces
 The alert also said that suspicious civilians should also be kept under watch, who may be Naxalites in some form or the other
 dilli kii arvind kejariwal sarkaar ne uplabdhiyaan to hasil kii hai, lekin vivaadon ke chalate unke kaam-kaaj main adchane bhi khub ai hai
 Before the election many issues were on the priorities of the Aam Aadmi Party, but despite the overwhelming majority, the AAP government failed to fulfill them at the moment
 aapako bataate hai ki kin morchon par beete 100 din main kejariwal sarkaar kaa kaam-kaaj santoshjanak nahin rahaa
 1
 janalokapaljis andolan ne artiai kaaryakarta arvind ko jaanbaaj netaa arvind kejariwal banaaya, vah janalokapal kaa andolan hi tha
 Kejriwal left the Chief Minister's chair on the same issue last time
 lekin is baar prachand bahumat ke baavjood dilli sarkaar ab tak janalokapal bill nahin paas karvaa saki
 After the dispute with LG, the Kejriwal government called an emergency session of the assembly, but they did not think to call a session for Janlokpal
 haalanki ek sugabugahat yah bhi he ki is baar party is kanoon ke draft ko acchhee tarah maanjhne main lagi he or is bare main jaldbaaji nahin karnaa chaahati
 Yet this is his failure on paper
 2
 Full state status is not possible without the support of the central government
 lekin yah chunavi vaada aam aadmi party kaa bhi tha, lihaaja dilli sarkaar bhi iske liye naitik taur par javabdeh he
 His success depends on the fact that he can get the central government to get full statehood
 lekin is par koi thos pahal ab tak nahin kii gai
 3
 mahila surakshamahilaon kii suraksha ke liye bason main marshalls kii tainaati ab tak nahin ho pai he
 Although AAP leaders are claiming to complete it very soon, yet the result is only due to Dhaka
 fast trek court banane kaa vaada bhi abhi amal main nahin laayaa gaya he
 The promise of providing security buttons in the mobile was also very much up in the air, but nothing has been done about it either
 4
 CCTV Cameras The AAP government had promised to install 1
5 lakh CCTV cameras all over Delhi
 yah sahi he ki 100 din main itane camere nahin lagaae ja sakate, lekin ise bhi kejariwal sarkaar ne apni sau dini praathmik pahal main nahin rakhaa
 5
 free vaai fifri vaai-faai kaa mudda to pehle din se hi vivaadon main he
 In the election, AAP did its work
 hindi main jari ghoshnaptr or kejariwal ke photo ke saath chunaav ke vakt lagi hordings main puri dilli ko muft vaai-faai dene kii baat kahi gai he, lekin angreji ke ghoshnaptr main saarvajanik jagahon kii baat he
 However, instead of timelines, this facility is planned to be provided on the basis of limited data
 iske liye farvari 2016 kii dedline rakhi gai he
 It is reported that the government is thinking of setting a limit of 50 MB of data every day at a minimum speed of 512 Kbps, but it has not been decided yet
 6
 Demand to make temporary employees permanent The workers working on the contract in Delhi voted overwhelmingly to the AAP
 unhen ummid thi ki kejariwal satta main aaenge to unhen sthaayee kar diya jayega
 But till now, disappointment has gone hand in hand on this front too
 7
 Clash with LG: Kejriwal government has fulfilled the promise of work on the issue of electricity and water in hundred days lekin kaam karne ke liye uparajyapal se sambandh thik rakhana bhi jaruri he
 The way the constitutional clash over rights has arisen in Delhi, then both the Lt
 Governor and the Chief Minister have to understand that the system will be governed by rules and not by imagination

 The Lahore High Court (LHC) has issued a notice to the federal and provincial governments of Pakistan in favor of Hafiz Saeed, the main conspirator of the Mumbai terror attack and the founder of the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba

 Many times, we learn and share many important things of life, not just from home, but our friends
 kuch aisa hi tab hota he jab aapke kisi dost kii shaadi ho jaati he or phir vah aapke saath apni shaadishuda jindagi ke bare main kuch jaruri baaten saajha karte hai
 Perhaps then you get to know a lot about marital life which you have never thought about
 aaie jaane, aisi hi kuch baaten hai jo shaadishuda log apane single doston ke saath baantate hai
 Marriage is not just a matter of a mother-in-law, this relationship needs to be seen outside the world of TV because the real life is different from the spice shown in the mother-in-law serials
 har saas vaimp nahin hoti or aapako bhi jarur ek pyaari or kering saas mil sakati he
 Yes, there are disputes at times, but they are all a part of life
 ladakon ko dekhnaa koi buree baat nahinshaadi ho gai to iskaa matlab yah bilkul nahin he ki aap apni doston ke saath handsam ladakon ko dekhne kaa chance miss kar den
 You can still joke like that
 spes dena he jarurishadi do logon ke ek hone kaa rishta jarur he lekin iskaa matlab yah bilkul nahin ki aap donon har kaam ab saath main hi karen
 To save the relationship from suffocation, giving space to each other is very important
 sapanom ke jaisaa nahin hota shaadi kaa pehla salji haa, pari katha jaisaa nahin hota shaadi kaa pehla saal
 a new home, new people and new place to fit themselves among all of them is not easy 
 sasuraal main aapaki jimmedaariyaan bhi hoti hai jo sapanom se bahut alag hoti hai
 There is a difference of ground-sky in lovefilm stories and real life
 isliye apane pati yaa patni se har samay pyaar bhare romance kii ummid na karen
 In this delicate time both of you need to make your relationship friendly
 shaareerik aakarshan ke saath hi saath imoshanalee atech hona bhi bahut jaruri he
 The mission of marriage is not just a child, but it will be a marriage
 Let's move the family forward
 If you too have this thing in your mind, then remove it from your mind at this time
 shaadi sirf bachche paidaa karne kaa mishan nahin hoti he
 Apart from the child, there are many such things and responsibilities between you that you have to share
 aap abhi sirf apane liye samay nikaal sakate habgar aap sochate hai ki ab shaadi ho gai or aapako apane bare main nahin sochna chahie to aisa bilkul nahin he
 Your identity is your own and marriage has nothing to do with it, so definitely take time for your work, hobbies and me time

 2
 hameshaa usee ke bare main sochna:jab aap kisi se pyaar karne lagate ho to aapke dimag main har samay usee vyakti kaa khyaal aata he
 Because when we are attracted to someone, phenylethylamine, the love drug hormone, comes out in our brain
 yah hormone us vyakti ke prati hamen pyaar kaa ehsaas karaata he

 uski khushi main khush hona:agar aap kisi vyakti ko khush dekhakar khushi mahasoos karte ho to aapkaa yah ehsaas isi baat kii taraf ishaara karata he ki aapako us vyakti se pyaar ho gaya he
 4
 dard kaa ehsaas naa hona:agar kisi vyakti ke paas hone, yaa uskaa photo dekhne se aapako apni takalif, pareshaaniyon kaa ehsaas kam hota he to matlab yahi he ki aapako usase pyaar hone laga he
 This has also been disclosed in a research
 is research kii report ke anusaar jabaaap kisi se pyaar karte hoor us vyakti se judi koi bhi cheez aapke paas hoti he to aapako apni pareshaaniyon kaa ehsaas 40 fisadi tak kam hota he
 5
 nai chijen tri karnaa:haalanki apni pehali date par ladke ho yaa ladkiyaan sabhi ek duusare ko impress karne ke liye kai tarah kii chijen tri karte hai
 Be it clothes, looks or perfumes
 lekin agar aap hameshaa hi kisi vyakti kii pasand ke anusaar hi chijen tri karte ho to samaj lijie ki aapako usase pyaar ho gaya he
 6
 dil kaa jor se dhadkna:es stdi kii report kii maane to jab aapke dil me kisi ke prati pyaar kii bhaavana paidaa hoti he to us vyakti ke saamne aane se yaa uskaa zikr hone se aapke dil kii dhadkan bad jaati he
 Not only this, the report of Shodh also claims that when you love someone, then you and that person's heart starts beating the same way
 patali qamar ko khubsuurati se jodakar dekhnaa ek saamaanya baat he
 By going to the gym, you can give a perfect shape to your waist, but if you want to go to a party and you do not want your waist to look thick, then these remedies can work for you
 1
 The stylish and fitdress up to the knee will make your waist look slimmer
 agar aap chahen to floral print kaa chayan kar sakati hai
 This will make your waist look comparatively thin
 2
 Wearing clothes in contrast can also make your waist look thinner
 klesh karte hue print vaale top or skirt moti qamar ko patala dikhaate hai
 Also, a skirt with a large polka dot can also give a good shape to your waist
 3
 Tight tops and floral skirts can also give your body a new look
 iske saath ek lanbaa necoles pahanakar aap stylish bhi najar aaengi
 4
 papalam top bhi aapke luk ko nikhaarane main madadgaar sabit honge
 It would be good to wear them with trousers
 saath hi aap belt kaa bhi istemaal kar sakati hai
 5
 kisi bhi phul length dress ke saath skini belt ke istemaal se qamar patali najar aegi

 The former Australian captain said that India not only needed good bowlers, but also had to learn to overcome a bad session
 donon khilaadiyon ne apane un dinon ko bhi yaad kiya jab donon ek-duusare ke khilaaf khelte the
 Gavaskar said, 'no matter how strong you are technically, you cannot succeed on Australian pitches due to lack of temperament
 ' unhone 1981 kii us vivaadaaspad ghatana ko bhi yaad kiya, jisamen unka denis lily ke saath vivaad ho gaya tha
 During the Australian tour, he was given a wrong out during the Test and he was also banned
 haalanki unhone us bhashaa ko dohraane se inkaar kiya, lekin mana ki unhone bhi khud par se niyantran kho diya tha

 1
 garmi ke mausam main bacchon ko thandak dene vaale sooti kapade pahanaaen or synthetic kapadon ko pehanaane se bachein
 Synthetic clothing can also cause rash to children

 Clothes napes are more comfortable for your baby
 ye garmi or dispojable nappy se hone vaali rashes se bhi bachaati hai
 If you have to wear diapers, then keep the children in a cool environment and wear appropriate clothes according to the temperature
 4
 In winter, baby clothes should be warm, soft and comfortable, as well as gloves and socks to keep baby's feet warm
 5
 The child should always wear clothes according to the temperature
 bachche ko sidhaa oonee kapadaa pehanaane ke bajaay pehle ek sooti kapadaa pehanaanaa chahie
 6
 bacchon ke kapadon kii quality kaa dhyaan rakhen or bacchon ke kapade dhone ke liye mild sope kar istemaal karen

 a picture is going viral on social media in which a large size photograph of the Indian philosopher, social reformer and founder of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) Sir Syed Ahmed Khan is seen on Dubai's Burj Khalifa

 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral image has been created with the help of Photoshop

 The Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world at 2700 feet, which is also a center of attraction for tourists around the world

 Apart from this, we searched the internet, but we could not find any media report on behalf of UAE government paying tribute to Sir Syed Ahmed Khan

 However, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Burj Khalifa was definitely decorated with Indian tricolor lights

 It is worth noting that on October 17, AMU celebrated 202 Vansar Syed Divasam on the occasion of the birth anniversary of its founder

 a post shared by Sushmita Sen (@sushmitasen47) on Sep 23, 2018 at 6:57am PDTA post shared by Sushmita Sen (@sushmitasen47) on Sep 7, 2018 at 6:52am PDT The devastation of the floods after the heavy rains in Uttarakhand can be gauged from the fact that everything has been swept around the Kedarnath temple at an altitude of about 12,000 feet
 kedarnath mandir ke adhyaksh ganesh godiyal ne bataaya ki mandir ko chhod yahaan sab kuch tabah ho chukaa he
 Several feet of debris has accumulated in the temple
 mandir ke andar kai logon ne sharan le rakhi he
 1,500 to 2,000 people are stranded in Kedarnath, which has been fitted with two helicopters to evacuate
 yah mandir saikadon saal se jis jagah par bana he, vah surakshit maani jaati rahi he, lekin is baar mandir ke thik peeche pahaado se sailaab aayaa or uske saath aae malbe main mandir kaa chabutara dab gaya
 a part of the temple is buried in the rubble and a stream of water is seen flowing around
 mandir surakshit he, lekin mandar parisar main pani or malbe kaa dher laga he
 At least 50 bodies have been seen in the nearby area
 700 se zyada khachchar vaale bhi laapata hai
 Most of the surrounding structures are missing
 mandir parisar ke paas chahal-pahal vaale ram baadaa ke vajood par sawalia nishaan lag gaya he
 Photographs taken by helicopter show that the area is submerged in water
 yahaan badi sankhya main yatri laapata hai
 The comments uttarakhand ke pithauragarh ke dharchaula tehsil main bhi halaat badtar hai
 In the pictures that are coming out, the Kali river is seen as a rage here
 nadi ne dharchaula main bharat−nepal seemaa ke gaanvon main bhayanak tabaahi machaai he
 Many houses have been hit by the fast flow of the river
 yahaan ke sobala gaanv kaa namonishaan mit gaya he
 Nearly a hundred houses in the village have been completely destroyed, while dozens of people are said to be missing
 gauratlab he ki kaali nadi hi aage uttar pradesh main jaakar sharada ke naam se jaani jaati he or yahaan pani ke tej bahaav kii vajah se uttar pradesh ke pilibhit jaise ilaakon main bahane vaali sharada nadi kaa jalastr bhi kaaphi bad gaya he
 Kedarnath temple president Ganesh Godiyal said that everything has been destroyed here except the temple
 mandir main kai feet malba jamaa hua he
 Many people have taken shelter inside the temple
 kedarnath main 1,500 se 2,000 log fanse hue hai, jinhen surakshit nikaalane ke liye do helicopter lagaae gaye hai
 The place where this temple has been built for hundreds of years has been considered safe, but this time the temple just behind the temple was swamped and the platform was buried in the debris that came with it
 mandir kaa ek hissaa malbe main dab gaya he or aasapaas pani kii dhara bahati hui dikh rahi he
 The temple is safe, but there is a pile of water and debris in the temple complex
 paas ke ilaake main kam se kam 50 shav dekhe gaye hai
 More than 700 mules are also missing
 aasapaas bane dhaanchon main se adhiktar gaayab hai
 The existence of a walking Ram Bada near the temple complex has been questioned

 The nomination of the village of Sobla has disappeared
 gaanv ke takreeban sau ghar puri tarah se tabah ho gaye hai, jabaki darjanon log laapata bataae ja rahe hai
 It is worth noting that the river Kali is further known as Sharda in Uttar Pradesh and due to the strong flow of water here, the water level of Sharda river flowing in areas like Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh has also increased considerably

 Ramcharan Nirmalkar (1926-2012) When Habib Tanveer Saheb assured vegetarian food and a safe flight to London, Ramcharan Dada i
e
 Ramcharan Nirmalkar agreed to step out of the house

 While leaving the house, he ate his favorite food, kheer-puri and wept with hugs from family members

 When the character playing these roles was named Ramcharan, the audience would say, Wow! And later as soon as the news of his departure was received, only this came out of everyone's mouth, ah! She has played the role of Phoolan Devi's father in the film Bandit Queen and that is why many film observers, along with the film's director Shekhar Kapur, were convinced of her acting

 haalanki yah hairat main padane vaali baat nahin
 In favor of the so-called theatrical mainstream, it is possible that Habib refuses to acknowledge Tanveer Saheb's contribution to contemporary Hindustani theater
 haalanki sadan ne ekamat se abhinay ke is puraskaar ke liye raamacharan kaa samarthan kiya
 However, the reality is that the concept of contemporary Hindustani theater is incomplete without the plays of Habib Saheb

 After meeting with Habib Saheb in 1974, when the new theater was in place, life became dusk
 31 saal tak theatre main jindagi aisi chali ki hindustani rangamanch ko ek behtareen abhinayta se vistaar mila
 Ramcharan Dada, who served the arts through Nacha Theater for nearly 65 years, returned home only after becoming disabled from his body
 theatre se bulaava aata rahaa, lekin raamacharan dada kehete, ''baithkar tankhwaah lenaa theatre ke liye acha nahin

 February 9, 2014: At a function organized by Kerala Pulayar Mahasabha, a Kerala institution, Narendra Modi said, "I want to say with great confidence that whatever ups and downs may have come in the 60 years of independence, but my word to you Write it down, the coming 10 years belong to the Dalit-backward and now the same thing is going on
 raajnneeti main log apane parivaar ke phaayde ke liye kaam karte hai

 "march 3: On the fifth day after Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party joined the NDA, Modi said at a poll meeting in Muzaffarpur, Bihar," The BJP, known as the Brahmin and the Banis, has now become a backward party
 aane vaala vakt dalit-pichhadon kaa hi he
 August 16: After the historic victory in Lok Sabha elections, when the list of bjp's new national president Amit Shah's team was released, this was the first time of bjp's political journey when the names of the officials were prominently mentioned in front of their caste / class
 Gone
 bijepi ne 11 upaadhyakshon main kareeb 50 fisadi jagah ek muslim samet pichde varg ke netaaon ko di
 The special feature of this list is that the word Brahmin or general category is not used anywhere, only the category of backward-dalits has been mentioned, and some names were also written in front of some names
 darasal is baar kaa loksabhaa chunaav ho yaa phir haalia sampann maharashtra-haryana ke vidhansabha chunaav, bijepi ne rajnatik vistaar kaa adhyay likh diya he
 It was not the BJP but the electoral strategy of a man who has now been established as the top leader in the BJP, who started preparing for the Lok Sabha elections behind the scenes three years before he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 sachmuch narendra modi ne soshal ejineering kaa aisa tanabana buna ki desh main unke naam kii lahar paidaa ho gai or unhone tamaam anumaanon ko dhwast karte hue loksabhaa chunaav or do rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke vistaar kaa nayaa adhyay likh diya
 backward-dalits contributed significantly to this expansion story of the BJP
 chunaav vishleshan karne vaali pramukh sanstha siesds ke mutabik, bijepi ko 2014 ke aam chunaav main 2009 ke mukaable rashtriya str par 12 fisadi to hindi pattee main 19 fisadi zyada pichde varg (obisi) ke vot mili
 bjp's vote in this category increased in every region of the country
 isi trend par bijepi ne maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav main marathiyon ke baad sabase zyada 70 obisi ummidavaar maidan main utaare to haryana main jaaton ke baad sabase zyada 17 ummidavaar or donon rajyon main is varg kaa sarvaadhik vot bhi party ko mila

" ’’ lekin kya party ke prati obisi ke is rujhaan ko bijepi kaayam rakh paaegi? kabhi bijepi ke think tanks rahe or party main soshal ejineering kii neenv rakhane vaale ke
 N
 govindacharya kehete hai, ‘‘bijepi ko sirf chunavi raajnneeti ke liye obisi kii baat nahin kerani chahie balki use sthayitv dene ke nazariye se kaam karnaa hoga
 At the moment, it seems to be an effort in terms of electoral strategy, so it cannot be concluded so soon that obcs have come with BJP
 ’’ haalanki himachal pradesh ke prabharee banaae gaye rashtriya sachiv shrikant sharma kehete hai, ‘‘bijepi sarvajan hitay, sarvajan sukhaay kaa paalan kar rahi he
 Our goal is Antyodaya
 use soshal ejineering kahen yaa kuch or bijepi to pichde-shoshiton ko aage laane kaa kaam kar rahi he
 However, the way the trend towards BJP has increased, the RSS considers it to be its achievement
 sangh ke vichaarak rakesh sinha kehete hai, ‘‘aresas kaa kaam is disha main jameen par bahut teji se chal rahaa tha, jiskaa rajnatik laabh swaabhaavik taur se bijepi ko mil rahaa he
 "but the OBC trend is a love for modi-bjp or a sign of the backward politics becoming disenchanted with the flag bearers
" siesds ke nideshak sanjay kumaar kaa maananaa he, ‘‘pichley 20 saal yaa mandal ke baad ke daur main sapa, jedy (you), jedy (es), argedy jaisi partiyaan ubharkar ain, jinka aadhaar obisi tha
 These parties have also been in government in their respective states
 lekin is varg ke matadaataaon kaa anubhav acha nahin rahaa he
 After this thinking people started getting disillusioned and these people started looking for new options
 ek sanyog tha ki desh main congress virdohi maahaul bana or log swaabhaavik taur se bijepi kii ore aakarshith hue
 The OBC leadership in BJP itself came
 ’’ lekin rajnatik vishleshak sanjay yah bhi maanate hai ki bihar main nitish-lalu ke gathbandhan ke baad obisi kaa ek bada tabaka laut aayaa, jisase bijepi ko nuksaan hua
 In such a situation, if the OBC parties come on one platform, then this class can also disperse from the BJP
 ek vakt tha jab congress kaa varchasv khatm karne ke liye kshetreey partiyon ne pichde vot kaa dhruvikaran kiya tha, jo ab phir se rashtriya party kii ore reverse gear main lautne lage hai
 To increase its base, each party makes a strategy for expansion by making a dent in the vote bank of other parties other than its core vote bank
 loksabhaa or ab do rajyon kii safalataa ke baad bijepi ke liye saamaajik sameekaran kaa bada imtihaan bihar or upi he
 Despite all the opposition in Bihar, the party is giving preference to OBC leaders like Sushil Modi and Nand Kishore Yadav

 They also state that the SP has won nine seats in the UP by-election on which BJP had mlas and the latest victory was in Kairana, which had been with the BJP for 30 years
 nishchit taur par pichhadon main yadav or anya samaaj kaa ek bada vot bank kabhi bijepi se nahin judaa
 But due to the party's solid strategy, the BJP has received more votes than expected in the recent elections
 spasht he ki musalamaanon main paith bananaa bijepi ke liye mushkil he or uske paas obisi-dalit samaaj ke alaava koi vikalp nahin he
 That is why Modi often spends the next decade in the speeches of Dalits and Backwards

 3 on the Richter Scale of Earthquake
 9 maapi gai he
 The epicenter of the earthquake is in Sonepat, Haryana
 raahat kii khabar ye rahi ki isamen kisi bhi prakaar kii kshati nahin hui he
 Explain that the higher the rectangular scale, the higher the vibration
 jaise 7
 9 Where buildings fall when earthquake on Richter scale 2
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par halkaa kampan hota he
 The simple arithmetic of the ratio between the maximum amplitude of the vibration of the ground and an arbitrary small amplitude during an earthquake is called the 'richter scale'
 'riktar paimaane' kaa puraa naam richter pariman pareekshan paimaana (richter magnitude test scale) he or laghu rup main ise sthanik pariman (local magnitude) he
 Why Earthquake comes - The top surface of the Earth is made up of seven tectonic plates
 jahaan bhi ye platen ek duusare se takaraati hai vahaan bukamp kaa khatra paidaa ho jaataa he
 An earthquake occurs when these plates try to penetrate into each other's area, the plates rub off from each other, it emits immense energy, and the earth above that friction or friction starts to oscillate, many times until the earth explodes
 It goes, sometimes for weeks, sometimes for several months, these energy comes out intermittently and earthquakes keep happening, it is called aftershock
 jaane richter paimaane par bukamp kii tivrata ke hisaab se kya ho saktaa he asar:- 0 se 1
 Seismographs show only when earthquakes occur on the 9 Richter scale
 - 2 se 2
 9 On the Richter scale there is a mild vibration when an earthquake occurs
 - 3 se 3
 9 If there is an earthquake on the Richter scale, a truck passes by you, this is the effect
 - 4 se 4
 9 An earthquake on the Richter scale can break windows
 deevaaron par tange frem gir sakate hai
 - 5 to 5
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par furniture hill saktaa he
 - 6 to 6
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par imaaraton kii neenv darak sakati he
 Upper floors may suffer damage
 - 7 se 7
 Buildings collapse when earthquakes occur on the 9 Richter scale
 jameen ke andar pipe fat jate hai
 - 8 to 8
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par imaaraton sahit bade pul bhi gir jate hai
 - Complete destruction due to earthquake on Richter scale of 9 and above 
 koi maidan main khadaa ho to use dharti laharaate hue dikhegi

 The summer days have started, so drivers of vehicles should also be careful, as it has been seen that as the temperature increases in Delhi, the crime on the roads increases every year
 aap maane yaa na maane, lekin manovaigyanikon kaa to yahi kahana he
 Psychologist Sameer Parekh said, 'several studies have found that mental stress increases with increasing temperature
 vaahanon kii badhati sankhya, pradooshan or shor iske kaaran hai
 It is clear that mental stress increases aggression in some people, which also increases crime on the streets
 'unhone kaha, 'garmi yani damaghontu mausam kisi ko bhi ashishnu bana saktaa he
 Vehicle drivers need to be careful with this problem
 is samasya se bachane kaa upaay karnaa chahie
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the maximum number of vehicle accidents in the second quarter of 2010 was 122,004

 varsh kii duusari timahi yani april, may or june main rajdhani main sabase adhik garmi rahati he
 That year the maximum temperature in this season was 40 degrees Celsius
 paarekh ne kaha ki us dauraan sadakon par garmi ko maat dene ke kai upaay kiye gaye the
 He said, 'in the summer people should try to avoid the stress created by excess of work
 vaahan chaalkon ko apana gussa kam karne ke liye adhik pani pinaa chahie tathaa kam bheed vaale raaston se chalanaa chahie or bahut lambi duuri tak vaahan nahin chalaanaa chahie
 Mohit Ranjan, an engineer living in Mayur Vihar in East Delhi, said, "if the car does not have AC in the summer, people can faint
" aise main logon main chidchidapan aa janaa tajjub kii baat nahin he
 ' congress party ne sabhi mukhyamantriyon ko chetavanee de di he ki ve apane-apane rajya main adhik se adhik siten jeetne kii koshish karen nahin to parinaam aane ke baad unki chuttee ho sakati he

 For now, disgruntled party leaders are visiting Delhi and demanding the removal of Chief Ministers in some states
 karnataka ke mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ab tak kehete aa rahe hai ki congress vahaan 28 main se 20 siten jeetegi
 His statement hinged on the fact that the party had defeated the BJP badly in the last assembly and won 122 out of 224 seats
 lekin ab purv mukhyamantri yediurppa ke waapas bijepi main laut jane se paristhitiyaan badal gai hai

 pichley teen saal se lagaataar aalu kii vaazib keemat na milane se kisaanon kii haalat kharaab he
 There are seven seats in western UP affected by potato issue - Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, Hathras, Aligarh, Firozabad, Kannauj and Farrukhabad
 inamen se paanch siton par pichhali baar bijepi ko jeet mili thi
 Therefore, the question is raised as to who will harm the farmers' displeasure over the potato issue
 indian express ke anusaar, aalu agra jile kii pramukh fasal he
 According to data for the year 2017-18, potato was produced on 57, 879 hectares of land in the district, of which both Agra and Fatehpur are part of the parliamentary constituency
 iske alaava hathras (46,333 hectare) or aligarh (23,332 hectare) main bhi aalu kaa bade paimaane par utpaadan hota he
 The second phase of these four seats is to be voted on April 18
 notebandi ke baad se hi keemat mil rahi kamaiske alaava firozabad (48,589 hectare) kannauj (50,089 hectare) or farrukhabad (35,168 hectare) main bhi bade paimaane par aalu kaa utpaadan kiya jaataa he
 Elections will be held on April 23 in Firozabad and Kannauj and on April 29 in Farrukhabad
 aalu kii keemten laagat se bhi kam milane se kisaan kaaphi naaraaz hai
 Farmers are getting just Rs 300-350 for a 50 kg sack, Rs 200-250 for Gulla potatoes and Rs 100 to 150 for Kirri potatoes for a normal thick potato
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki notebandi ke baad se hi aalu ke aise hi behad kam bhav mil rahe hai
 Potato is sown in three parts from October 15 to November 5 and harvests from February 20 to March 10
 aamtaur par fasal taiyaar hone ke baad kisaan uskaa kareeb 20 fisadi hissaa hi bechate hai taaki mazdooron kaa bhugtan kar saken or apane kharchon ke liye kuch paisa batch sake
 The rest of the potatoes are stored in cold storage, where the potatoes are kept at a temperature of 2 to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of November
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki 8 november, 2016 se pehle agra ke cold storage main aalu kii keemat prati bori 600 se 700 rupee mil rahi thi, lekin notebandi ke baad cold storage main maal padaa rah gaya or koi aalu kharidne vaala nahin tha
 100 to 125 rupees per bag for coarse potatoes, while Gulla and Kirri potatoes were not ready to take any free
 pichley teen fasali sijan aalu ke kisaanon ke liye bhayaavah sabit hue hai
 There is neither money nor buoyancy in the market, so there is no clearance of goods
 kisaanon ke mutabik aalu par laagat hi 475 se 500 rupee prati bori tak aa jaati he, aise main teen saal se behad kam keemat par aalu bechnaa unke liye bhayaavah sabit ho rahaa he

 RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav did not leave the house on Eid day
 yah vastav main ek chaunkaane vaali khabar he
 There is a lot of speculation about this
 aakhir kya vajah he ki jo lalu prasad yadav apane ko secular dikhaane kaa koi mauka nahi chookte, vah is saal ke id main kahin nahi gaye
 It is true that his health is not well, but Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav and Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav are healthy
 wo bhi kahin nahin gaye
 On the other hand, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar went to the historic Gandhi Maidan in Patna on the morning of Eid on the occasion of Eid and congratulated him

 Nitish Kumar has been continuously attending the event for the last 12 years

 nitish kumaar gandhi maidan ke alaava khanke mujabia imaarte sharia samet aadhe darjan jagahon par gaye or logon ko id kii mubaarakabaad di
 But Lalu Prasad Yadav did not say on this occasion, it is a matter of discussion
 halaki unhone shuukravaar ko iftaar party di thi, jisamen mahagathbandhan ke sabhi netaa shaamil hue the
 However, during that time there was a lot of discussion in the media about his body language that Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar were not talking to each other despite sitting around
 sara maamla raashtrapati chunaav se judaa hua he
 Lalu Yadav is angry at Nitish Kumar's decision to support NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind

 Although there are many reasons behind Lalu Prasad Yadav not going to Eid Milan, the main one is to avoid media questions because the media wants answers on the statement explaining Nitish Kumar
 saath hi, nitish ke tevar ke baad ye saaf he ki wo maanane ko taiyaar nahi he, aise main argedy kaa ruukh kya hoga yah dekhnaa hoga
 But even though Lalu may not have gone out to meet Eid, he kept thinking about his next strategy throughout the day

 film abhinayta vinod khanna ko aakhri baar apni vidaai dene pura bollywood pahunchaa
 The last prayer meeting for Vinod Khanna was held in Worli, Mumbai on Wednesday, in which the entire Bollywood made its presence known
 lekin bollywood ke jis abhinayta ne twit kar ye sab kiya wo khud is maukey se gaayab dikhe
 Yes, we are talking about actor Rishi Kapoor
 aapako bataa den ki rishi kapur ne vinod khanna ke antim sanskaar ke din twit kar dukh jataayaa tha ki kis tarah bollywood ke stars vinod khanna ko antim vidaai denne nahi pahunche
 But after Rishi Kapoor's tweet, every big Bollywood actor from Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai, Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Madhuri Dixit, Sonakshi Sinha, Sonam Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan to Vinod Khanna's prayer meeting arrived, but Rishi Kapoor himself was missing from this occasion
 vinod khanna ke antim sanskaar se kai sitare dur, rishi bole- chamache bas party karne jate hemhaalanki rishi ne apni upasthiti vinod khanna ke antim sanskaar ke din darj karai lekin rishi twit karne ke baad bhi prarthana sabha main nahi aae
 Neither the sage nor any member of his family appeared here
 kapur khandaan se keval is maukey par rajeev kapur aae
 Also Vinod Khanna's close friend and Bollywood's Dabangg Khan Salman Khan also did not come here
 yahaan sabhi sitaron ne vinod khanna ko bhavpurn shradhanjali di
 These were tweeted by Rishi Kapoor

 — Rishi Kapoor (@chintskap)april 27, 2017 If the BJP contested the MCD election, the first promise was cleanliness and the public believed the promise and won the BJP with majority in all three mcds
 ab baari party kii he, isliye to bijepi ne nae parshadon ke aupchaarik taur par kaamkaaj sanbhaalane ke pehle hi ek aisa plan banaaya he, jisase dilli chamak uthe or bijepi kaa vaada puraa hota hua bhi saaf taur par dikhe
 After the victory in the MCD, the bjp's mega plan to focus on cleanliness is that thousands of people sweep the streets of Delhi together and clean up Delhi
 isse ek to sandesh jayega ki bijepi safai ko lekar sanjeeda he or jeetne ke baad ye safai abhiyaan kii ek shandaar shuruyaat bhi hogi
 For this, BJP has also received proposals from voluntary organizations
 deraa sachcha sauda ke log bhi karenge madadbijapi sutron ke mutabik 7 may ko deraa sachcha sauda ke saath party dillibhar main ek mega safai abhiyaan chalaaegi, jisamen deraa sachcha sauda ke ek lakh se zyada wolintiers dilli kii sadakon par utrenge or sadakon ke saath naaliyon ko bhi saaf karenge
 In this, the entire staff of MCD will support them along with BJP workers
 dilli main gandagi bada muddis mega safai abhiyaan se dilli ko ek hi din main chamkaaya jayega, taaki bijepi emsidi chunaav main jeet ke baad apana pehla vaada puraa kar paae
 According to Delhi BJP vice-president Rajiv Babbar, if a voluntary organization is coming forward to support cleanliness, the party will not back down, but will welcome such cooperation for the betterment of Delhi
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne jeetne ke baad unhone dilli kii safai ko apni sabase pehali praathamikta bataaya tha, isi bayaan ke baad deraa sachcha sauda ke pramukh garumit ram rahim ne party ke saamne ye prastaav rakhaa or ab 7 may ko dilli ek mega safai abhiyaan kii gavaah banegi
 The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (DSGMC) presented Baba Bachan Singh ji Karseva Wale, who devoted his entire life for Karseva, to complete gold, silver and diamond works worth nearly Rs 6 crore in the Gurughar

 Manjeet Singh said that during his tenure, he handed over gold and silver to Baba Bachchan Singh for the second time of Karseva works
 baba ji jahaan bhi iskaa istemaal karenge, vah sangton kii aavashyaktaa or sahuuliyat par nirbhar karegaa
 The committee is committed to fulfill the dream of starting the Bala Sahib Hospital of Sachsewasi Pantharatna Baba Harbans Singh Ji Karseva
 isliye bala sahib hospital ko nijee haathon se chhudaakar cameti ne swayan shuru karne kaa prastaav beete dinon kaaryakarini main paas karaayaa he
 Manjeet Singh also recalled what Baba Harbans Singh said to his father Jathedar Santokh Singh during the 1980s
 baba ji ne us samay jatthedaar ji ko kaha tha, ‘jatthedaar ji aap gurudhaamon ke liye jaminen praapt karte jaaen or main tarashata jaaoongaa
 'I did not understand this at that time, but after seeing the skyrocketing prices of land in Delhi, i have come to understand Baba Harbans Singh's talk today that Baba Ji treated the land as gold and Gurudham-schools and hospitals as jewels
 He talked
 singh ne saaf kiya ki maujuuda cameti ne gurudhaamon par sona lagane par paisa kharch karne kii bajaay dharmprachaar, shiksha, itihaas sanbhaalane evam saamaajik kalyaan ke kaam karne par bal diya he
 But in many places, gold has been applied to the Gurudhams keeping the reverence and service of the sangatas predominant
 is sambandh main jike ne beete dinon gurudwara bangala sahib ke mukhya daravaaje par sona chadhaane kii kisi gurupremi dwaara karwaai gai seva kii bhi hawala diya
 a 10 kg silver sword given by Raja Baldeep Singh was also handed over to Baba Ji

 india today conklev 2019 main actress katrina caff ne shirkat kii
 He had a special chat with moderator Sushant Mehta about his career and his recent films in an session titled Interstellar: My journey into Bollywood from a different planet
 katrina se poocha gaya ki aapane apni pichhali donon filmon jiro or bharat se apni acting kshamtaaon ko sabit kiya he, iske baavjood aapane thags of hindustaan jaisi film kyon kii jisamen aapke paas kuch khaas karne ke liye hi nahin tha? kya ek superstar hone ke baavjood aapke liye filmon ko manaa karnaa itnaa mushkil he ?is par katrina ne kaha ki aapaki baat sahi he or hamaari audiyans ko lekar jimmedaari he
 Our attention was right about that film
 ham soch kar chal rahe the ki ye pirets of di carabian kaa indian fan varjan hoga
 This film was made with high hopes but there is a lot of risk in such films
 agar ye chalati to saal kii sabase zyada kamai karne vaali film bhi sabit ho sakati thi lekin chunki ye ummiido par khari nahin utari to ye zyada chali nahin
 But to be honest, i told Aditya Chopra that i want to play Fatima Wala because i can relate more than that character
 unhone aage kaha ki us samay tak fatima ko cast nahin kiya gaya tha lekin aditya ne mujhe kaha ki mujhe isi role par focus karnaa chahie
 i have done 5 films with Yash Raj
 neuyork, jab tak he jaan, tiger series jaahir he main unki opinian ko kaaphi tavajjo detii hum or ek khaas baat or he ki main yun to apni bahan ko salaah nahin detii hum, lekin wo bhi filmon main entry karne ja rahi he, usne acting kaa course bhi kiya he to main use baar-baar lagaataar kahati hum ki film industry main kisi bhi cheez ko persenalee mat lo
 Meaning do not become more sensitive about things
 katrina ne aage kaha ki aisa nahin he ki aap samvedansheel hona hi chhod den kyonki aakhirkaar ham insaan hai or hamaare imotions hai
 But i mean that in this cinema business there is no need to be sensitive about things and you have to be very strong
 aapako hameshaa taiyaar rahanaa hoga ki aap girane ke baad hameshaa uth khadey hone ke liye taiyaar rahen
 This can make a big difference on your life because this profession is not easy at all

 profasar ne shahid bhagat singh par dher sara kaam kiya he or jeenyu main adhyaapan kar chuke hai
 Speaking on the legacy of Bhagat Singh, Sudhir Vidyarthi said that in today's era the society has divided Bhagat Singh
 alag-alag vichaardhaara ke log unhen apane kheme main khinchne kii koshish kar rahe hai lekin bhagat singh kaa kad itnaa ooncha he ki wo kisi dharm, jati, vichaardhaara ke chaate ke bheetar nahin samaa sakate

 com / jelm38crw5 — Alberto Bagnoli  (@bagnolimd) August 31, 2017 rajasthan main vipakshi bhartiya janata party ne kamjor halaat se jujh rahi congress ke haath main baithe-baithaae ek mudda thama diya he or is tarah 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main apni jeet kii daavedaari ko kamjor kar liya he
 This controversy, which arose under the top leadership of the BJP, could certainly have been avoided
 isane congress ke bheetar nai jaan phoonk di he
 BJP national president Nitin Gadkari warned opposition leader Vasundhara Raje to be prepared for 'drastic consequences' if she does not succeed, after which Vasundhara threatened to resign from the party's primary membership on 5 May
 darasal, gadakari chaahate the ki vasundhara apane pratidwandvi gulab chand kataaria kii raily ko safal banane main unki madad karen
 Kataria is the former Home Minister of the state and is a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 sangh vasundhara ko pasand nahin karata, jabaki raaje kaa maananaa he ki satta main bhaajapa kii vaapasi par ve hi mukhyamantri pad kii prabal daavedaar hongi
 Kataria canceled her visit following Vasundhara's threat
 isse pehle ve ise lekar jid par ade the
 Despite this, in the next two days, 56 of the party's 78 mlas and several activists submitted their resignations in support of Vasundhara
 yah silsilaa tab thama jab vasundhara ne ise rokane ko kaha
 Despite the party leadership reposing confidence in him, his rival faction led by state BJP president Arun Chaturvedi took disciplinary action against the mlas involved in the drama of resigning
 is ghatana ne tay kar diya ki yah anaavashyak vivaad, jisase bachaa ja saktaa tha, ab jaldi thamane vaala nahin
 Everything was going well for the BJP before May 5
 kharaab prashasnic pradarshan ke chalate congressi mukhyamantri ashok gahalot kii sthiti acchhee nahin thi
 As a result, the sense of victory in the next elections within the BJP fell apart and about half a dozen anti-vasundhara leaders began to stake their claim to the post of Chief Minister
 ab tak na to vasundhara or na hi ye netaa ek saath baithkar disambar 2013 main party kii jeet kii koi ranneeti bana sake hai
 While the party believed that it would be too early to put forth any strategy through visits and rallies, Kataria and her supporters believed that this was the right time to beat
 phir aakhir bhaajapa ko is apratyaashit sankat main kisne daalaa? vasundhara is baat se niraash thim ki pehle unhen is yatra kii yojana banaae jane se baahar rakhaa gaya or baad main ise kaamyaab banane ke liye kataaria kii madad karne ko kah diya gaya jo mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar hai lekin jamini str par unka baari virodh he
 Kataria was accused of not including the legislators and party officials from the areas from which he had planned his trip
 inamen se adhiktar vasundhara ke vafaadaar hai, jo nahin chaahate the ki unki sahmati ke bagaiyr kataaria kaa netritv unke upar thopa jaae
 Kataria unveiled the Yatra posters to Rajnath Singh and state BJP president Arun Chaturvedi, both of whom later claimed that they were not aware that these posters belonged to the yatra
 april ke chauthe hafte main kataaria ko ehsaas ho gaya ki ve akele dam par yatra nahin kar sakate, lihaaja unhone vasundhara se samarthan maanga
 Vasundhara turned down his request, saying that his health was not well
 iske baad kataaria ke khilaaf virodh us samay saarvajanik str par tej ho gaya, jab party kii rashtriya mahasachiv kiran maheshwari 27 april ko rajsamand main kataaria se milane ke baad rote hue lautin
 He was not invited there at all
 is ghatana se majaboor hokar gadakari ne 2 may se prastaavit is yatra ko taal diya or 30 april ko rajya kor cameti kii baithak dilli main bula lee
 At the Delhi meeting, Vasundhara and Deputy Leader of Opposition Vasundhara anti-ghanshyam Tiwari suggested to postpone the visit and keep it around Diwali, which Gadkari rejected
 ab tak sthiti yah ho chuki thi ki tiwari samet mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar anya netaa bhi kataaria ke sir par aresas ke haath se hataash ho chuke the
 However, he was also satisfied with Vasundhara's gritty in the process
 gadakari chaahate the ki yatra 9 may se shuru ho or is sambandh main sari aupchaariktaayen 5 may ko jaipur main nipta lee jaaen
 But on the same day, anti-vasundhara BJP leaders like Chaturvedi, Tiwari and former state BJP president Om Mathur agreed that the yatra had to be canceled and the workers would have to prepare a new plan after joining it
 yah baat bhi rakhi gai ki yatra ko rishabhdev mandir se shuru karne kii yojana kaa adivasee virodh kar rahe hai
 This is traced back to February 2007, when Kataria was the Home Minister
 us dauraan jain samudaay dwaara mandir par kabje ke khilaaf pradarshan kar rahe adivaasiyon par police golibari hui thi
 In the event of protests, no BJP member wanted to take the responsibility of making this trip a success 
 kataaria is baat par ade hue the ki yadi vasundhara chahen to yatra ho sakati he, is tarah unhone paroksh rup se vasundhara par yatra main khalal daalane kaa aarope hi laga daalaa
 At this point, the representative of the RSS and the anti-vasundhara Captain Singh Solanki present at the meeting were constantly asking Rajya Sabha MP Bhupendra Yadav to call Gadkari
 jab yadav ne phone milaayaa, to solanki ne unase phone lekar gadakari ko yah kah diya ki yatra par sirf vasundhara ko aapatti he, puri cameti ko nahin
 After this, Gadkari vented his anger on Vasundhara, "then you get ready to face harsh consequences, you know who wants all this
" '' is tarah vasundhara ko yatra se dur rahane kii ijaajat nahin di gai jabaki vasundhara ne bataaya ki ve apane samarthakon se sirf teen dinon ke bheetar yatra ko kaamyaab banane ko nahin kah saktin
 Gadkari had already decided that if the yatra failed, Gaz would fall on Vasundhara
 istife kii dhamkee ne vasundhara ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he kyonki party ke prati unki vafadari par hameshaa sawaal bana rahegaa
 When she reached home after threatening to resign, she told some of her loyal people, "the parties produce the chief minister, but here they are trying to eliminate it
" yahi kaam inhone dilli main madanlaal khurana ke saath kiya, uttarakhand main khandudi or uttar pradesh main kalyaan singh ke saath kiya
 As a result, all three kingdoms got out of their hands
 ''vasundhara party ke adhisankhya kaaryakartaaon or vidhayakon kii nirvirodh netaa hai, par unke virdohi dhade kaa kahana he ki ve akele chunaav nahin jeet saktin
 The party has lost under his leadership in the 2008 assembly and 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 is dhade ne unhen 2010 main vipaksh ke netaa ke pad se hatwa diya tha, lekin party ne waapas 2011 main unhen yah pad diya
 National level leaders have been declaring that the next election will be fought under Vasundhara's leadership, but their opponents say that they are not necessarily the Chief Minister
 vasundhara 2012 se hi apane virodhiyon ke nishane par rahi hai jab unhen party kii kaman saunpi gai thi
 This same fact used to suffocate Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 vah yahi chahta tha ki mukhyamantri usee ke bich se aae
 The challenge before the top leadership of BJP and RSS is to resolve this issue
 ve ab vasundhara ko or sharminda hota tathaa vasundhara virdohi dhade kii araajaktaa ko badhata nahin dekh sakate, jo khud ko party se upar maanata he, jo aresas kii aawaaj hone kaa daawa karata he or us par yah ummid bhi karata he ki vasundhara unke liye kaam karen

 Actually Ravindra Jadeja believes that he is the leading all-rounder of India
 par flipcart, jo ki Xiaomi ke aane vaale phone kaa oficial celler he, uskaa maananaa he ki sar jadeja unke alrounder kaa muqabla nahin kar sakate
 But you do not have to worry, this is not an official talk
 yah keval Xiaomi ke pramotion ke liye flipcart dwaara banaae gaye video kaa hissaa he
 In which Flipkart informs that on January 19, India is going to visit us as an all-rounder and asks if you know who he is? So Jadeja arrives and as an all-rounder Flipkart has his match due to his match on January 19
 The event is called on 20 January

 In India too, the price of this phone is likely to be around the same
 phone ko gold, grey or silver color verient main launch kiya gaya tha jisamen rier panel main fingar print bhi tha

 There, he was supposed to disguise Modi and go to other places including a tea shop, but Vidya postponed the idea due to the protest against it

 The Marxist Communist Party (CPM) has put an end to any possibility of any coordination with the Congress
 bataa den ki kolkata main 19 se 21 janvari tak sipiem kii central cameti kii baithak hui
 According to sources, there was such a ruckus within the CPM about the electoral alliance with the Congress that the party rejected the proposal of Sitaram Yechury, the general secretary of the party, in which he had talked about aligning with the Congress
 khabaron ke mutabik seetaram yechuri party mahasachiv hone ke baavjood apane prastaav ke naamanzoor hone se is kadar aahat hue ki unhone istipha dene tak kaa prastaav de diya
 The sharp differences between former general secretary Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury are not hidden from anyone within the CPM
 ‘hardliner’ maane jane vaale karaat ko jahaan party kii kerala lobby kaa samarthan hasil bataaya jaataa he vahiin ‘vyaavhaarik’ yechuri ke peeche bengal lobby khadi bataai jaati he
 But after this meeting in Kolkata, differences within the party came out more openly
 seetaram yechuri chaahate the ki sipiem 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sabhi loktantric or secular dalon ke saath kandhe se kandhaa milakar chale taaki bijepi kaa muqabla kiya ja sake
 But in the CPM meeting in Kolkata, Prakash Karat's faction was heavy, saying that there should not be any agreement with Congress either directly or indirectly
 seetaram yechuri ke prastaav ko sirf 31 vot mili jabaki prakaash karaat ke prastaav ko 55 vot mili
 It is important to note here that the CPM Congress is scheduled to have an important meeting in Hyderabad in April
 usase pehle party kii 2019 loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneetik line tay karne par party ke draft ko antim rup diya janaa tha
 The cpm's decision to keep distance from the Congress is not just a setback for Sitaram Yechury
 sipiem ke is andruni ghamaasan kaa sidhaa asar congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii 2019 loksabhaa chunaav ke liye ranjaiti par bhi padegaa
 Allies with whom Rahul Gandhi wants to besiege Modi in 2019, they are all going to break in turn

 Despite contesting with the Congress in the Uttar Pradesh elections, the Samajwadi Party was so upset by the defeat that it too does not want to at least align with the Congress before the elections
 sharad pavaar kii ensipi par congress bharosa nahin kar sakati kyonki maharashtra se lekar gujarat tak main ensipi congress ke khilaaf chunaav lard chuki he or yah khabar aam he ki ensipi bijepi ke kareeb ja rahi he
 Mamata Banerjee is definitely fighting against the BJP, but considering the political politics of Bengal, how far she will go with the Congress is difficult to say
 odisha main naveen patnayak khud hi mushkilon main ghire najar aate hai lekin vah congress ke saath jane kii bajaae akele hi chunaav ladanaa pasand karenge
 The Congress cannot speculate about Mayawati whether or not she will align with the Congress and if she does, how many seats she would like to give to the Congress
 uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav ke samay bhi samaajawaadee party ke saath talmail hone se pehle congress ne mayawati kaa man tatolane kii koshish kii thi lekin baat bani nahin thi
 In Tamil Nadu, the Congress must be hoping that the DMK will come with it, but Congress leaders will surely be worried about the improving relationship between the Karunanidhi family and the BJP
 lalu yadav or farrukh abdulla jaise netaa jarur congress ke saath honge lekin sipiem ke bheetar congress ke khilaaf prastaav paas hone se vipaksh ko ekajute karne main congress ke prayaason ko bada jhatka jarur laga he
