 unhone arun jetali ke raajnneetik bajood par sawaal khadaa karte hue kaha ki jab puure desh main modi lahar thi, to aise main arun jetali ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 He said that the seven decision program of the Bihar government has accelerated the pace of development in Bihar
 kirti aaazaad ne bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki vah mithila virdohi hai
 He said that at the behest of Jaitley, Sushil Kumar Modi has been ignoring Mithila
 bijepi saansadane kaha ki sach bolnaa agar gunaah he, to yah gunaah baar-baar karte rahenge
 He said that his name is one of the five mps to raise the most questions in Parliament and participate in the discussion
 darbhanga sebijapi saansad kirtine kaha ki supreme court kaa kahana he ki rishwat lenaa or dena donon gunaah he, isko jaanate hue chuppi saadhe rahanaa sabase bada gunaah he
 BJP MP Kirti Azad has already been commenting on these leaders of Bihar and Center, but this attack has taken place when the date of his wife Poonam Azad's joining the Aam Aadmi Party has been fixed
 mahila or bal kalyaan ko lekar madhya pradesh sarkaar ke daawey jo bhi hon, is pradesh main laadaliyon kii jaan ko sabase zyada khatra he
 This is what the five-year data of the National Health Intelligence Bureau report of the National Health Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of Health, released from Nirman Bhawan in New Delhi says
 beuro ne ye aankade rashtriya aparaadh record beuro (enciarabi) ke hawaale se die hai
 Madhya Pradesh has embarrassingly topped all the states and union territories of the country including punjab-haryana with 23 cases of feticide and 51 cases of infanticide during the year 2009

 These deaths of young children appear sensitive in view of the current adverse circumstances of declining infant sex ratio in the state
 beete 4 april ko jari hue janaganana-2011 ke praarambhik aankade bhi madhya pradesh main nanhee balikaon kii jindagi ko lekar syah tasviir pesh karte hai
 The data on infant sex ratio (ratio of girls to children below 6 years of age) is also quite shocking
 jahaan yah anupaat varsh 2001 kii janaganana ke prati 1,000 baalkon par 932 balikaon kii tulana main 20 ank ghat kar 912 rah gaya
 In the year 2001, where there were less than 900 girls per 1,000 boys in 4 districts, Morena, Bhind, Gwalior and Datia, in the preliminary figures of 2011, this situation has been done in 10 districts and now in Shivpuri, Tikamgarh, Chhatarpur, Sheopur and the state
 The commercial capital Indore has also been added and Narsinghpur (900) and Guna (901) are also on the shore

 In fact, due to social reasons, the gwalior-chambal region of Madhya Pradesh has been a major center for female feticide and female infanticide
 gaanvon main yah kahawat prachlit he ki ek rupaya or ek moda kisi kaa kaam nahin
 Many misconceptions and social malpractices are responsible for this traditionally prevalent social evil

 Soon after Arvind Kejriwal's declaration of contesting against Narendra Modi from Banaras, the Modi government has responded to all the allegations made by Kejriwal
 kejariwal apni har sabha main ab sirf narendra modi par hi nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 During the Gujarat visit too, Kejriwal asked 16 questions to Modi
 isi silsile main vah modi se milanaa bhi chaahate the, lekin unhen samay nahin mila
 a 16-page reply was released late Tuesday from Narendra Modi's office
 isamen gujarat sarkaar ne arvind kejariwal ke aaropon kaa silsilewar jawaab diya he
 The Gujarat government has said that Kejriwal is making baseless and untrue allegations
 gas keemton par gujarat sarkaar ne spasht kiya he ki is mudde par bijepi kii raay shuru se saaf rahi he
 The Standing Committee, headed by Yashwant Sinha, had asked to rethink the decision to increase gas prices from April 2014
 gujarat ke urja mantri saurabh patel ne gas keemten badhaane kaa virodh kiya tha
 The statement said that by making such allegations, Kejriwal is advocating import of gas from multinational companies at higher prices, hence he is accused of being an agent of America
 reliance kaa sirf 10 fisadi hissaa he, jabaki sarkari company oengisi kaa 80 fisadi
 Arvind Kejriwal has also been hit back in this statement
 kejariwal se poocha gaya he ki vah yah bataaen ki unki party ne agasta westland helicopter ghotaale main exiaar kii maang kyon nahin kii, jisamen sonia gandhi sidhe taur par shaamil hai
 Was this not done due to Kejriwal's close association with Sonia and NAC? gujarat kii krishi vruddhi dar par lagaae gaye kejariwal ke aaropon ko bhi galat bataaya gaya he
 According to the statement issued by the Chief Minister's Office, according to the Planning Commission, agriculture growth rate in Gujarat under the leadership of Narendra Modi has been 11 percent in the last decade
 kejariwal ne jhuthe aankade bataakar gumraah kiya
 Kejriwal's allegations that Modi's claims of progress in education were false have also been denied
 bayaan ke mutabik jab modi mukhyamantri bane, tab drop out rate 20 fisadi tha, ab yah ghatakar do fisadi rah gaya he
 Kejriwal has been alleging that the Narendra Modi government benefited the Adani industry group
 is par bayaan main kaha gaya he ki modi kii aguwai main gujarat main sabhi udyog-dhandhe fale-foole hai
 Not only Adani, all industries benefited
 adani kaa sirf gujarat hi nahin, anya rajyon main bhi nivesh he
 The Adani Group accounts for just 35 per cent of the total investment in Gujarat
 jahaan tak bhoomi adhigrahan niti kaa sawaal he, gujarat kii bhoomi adhigrahan niti kii supreme court ne bhi tarif kii he
 Kejriwal has been alleging that more than 800 farmers have committed suicide in Gujarat
 is par bayaan main kaha gaya he ki yah dilachasp he ki kejariwal rahul gandhi kii hi tarah yah maamla uthaa rahe hai
 According to the statement, there are no cases of farmer suicides in Gujarat
 maharashtra or andhra pradesh do congress shasit rajyon main sabase zyada kisaanon ne aatmahatyaayein kii hai
 Reversing Kejriwal, it has been said that it would be better to tell Kejriwal what the Aam Aadmi Party government did in Delhi? Rape continued to grow and crimes were perpetrated on the basis of racism, even their ministers were involved in racism
 'aap' kii sarkaar ke dauraan sirf 23 dinon main thand kii vajah se 174 logon kii maut ho gai
 Even the National Human Rights Commission had to intervene in the case of people dying of cold
 kejariwal, modi par yah bhi aarope lagaate hai ki unhone bhrashtachar ke mudde par samjhauta kiya he
 In particular, the cases of two ministers of the Modi government - Purushottam Solanki and Babubhai Bokharia are mentioned
 is par mukhyamantri karyaalay kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki solanki ke khilaaf koi chargeshit nahin he, jabaki babubhai bokharia ke khilaaf sazaa par oonchi adaalat se roak laga di gai he
 On the issue of Sikh farmers in Kutch, the Gujarat government says that 454 Sikh families from Punjab and Haryana still own land, while Kejriwal is helping the real estate mafia illegally purchase agricultural land
 gandhidam, bhuj or moondada ke aasapaas farji kisaan banakar is mafia ne kheti kii jameen khabaidi he
 Kejriwal is also involved in this fraudulent business of 15 to 20 thousand crores by supporting fake farmers
 bijli, berogari, narmada kaa pani kisaanon kii bajaay kaarkaanon ko die jane, saura urja kii daron, swasthya ke aankadon, gujarat ke chote or manzole udyogon jaise muddon par lagaae gaye kejariwal ke aaropon kaa bhi is bayaan main silsilewar dhang se jawaab diya gaya he

 Similarly, the distance of 121 kilometers from Araria to Bhatiyani was completed in five to six hours, while now people are completing this distance in three hours
 bihar kii satta main jab 6 varsh purv rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (rajg) kii sarkaar ai thi, to mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki aisi sadake banaai jaaengi ki rajya main kahin se bhi logon ko rajdhani patna pahunchane main chaar se paanch ghante lagen
 Today, at least in the matter of road construction, this government's promise is proving true to an extent
 nitish sarkaar apni duusari pari kaa ek varsh 26 navambar ko puraa kar rahi he
 In such a situation, this government has a lot to say for the development of the road
 madhubani se sate supaul jile ke nirmali anumandal jane main ab maatr aadhe ghante kaa samay lagata he jabaki yah duuri bina kosi kii dhar paar kiye or baaluu kii ret paar kiye nahin puri ho sakati thi

 paanch bade pulon lohia sethu, bhagalpur, katauza pul, sitamarhi ke dubhbha ghat or labha pul kaa nirmaan ho chukaa he
 People of the area also say that when this bridge was not built, then one had to travel 237 kilometers via Purnia to Mithilanchal via Nepal or cross five districts by rail
 aankadon ke anusaar nitish sarkaar main is nigam ne ab tak 750 pul or 758 kilometre se zyada kii sadaka kaa nirmaan puraa kiya he
 According to an official of the bridge construction corporation, today the corporation has benefited more than Rs 90 crore

 State Road Construction Minister Nandkishore Yadav says that the government is committed to road construction
 vah kehete hai ki centre sarkaar ne bhi rajya kii kuch sadakon ke liye sweekruti pradaan kar di he jis kaaran sadak nirmaan main or gati aegi
 Experts say that the speed and development of road construction played a major role in getting the present National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government back
 is kaaran sarkaar apni duusari pari main bhi sadak nirmaan or uske vikaas main koi kotahi nahin baratna chaahati

 haryana ke bahadurgard main ek patni ne aisi vaardaat ko anjaam diya ki uski daastaan sunakar logon kaa kalejaa kaanp uthaa
 On seeing the woman's haughtiness, people's hue stood up
 us bevafa bivi ne pehle apane hi pati kaa katl kiya or baad main laash kai tukade kar die
 Not only this, after killing the husband, that woman sat near the corpse and kept watching TV
 avaidh sambandh kaa maamlaakhir bivi kii is berahami kii vajah kya thi
 Why that infidel gave such a dreadful death to her husband
 to iskaa jawaab he bivi kaa kisi gairmard ke saath avaidh rishta
 According to the family of the deceased, his accused wife had illicit relationships with many people
 is baat lekar hi ghar main jhagada shuru ho gaya tha
 But instead of leaving their illicit relations, that wife hatched a creepy conspiracy
 apane pati ke katl kii sajeesh
 This incident of husband, wife and 'heart-wrenching' is in Bahadurgarh area of haryana adjoining Delhi
 jahaan asanda gaanv main rahane vaale balajit kii shaadi chaar saal pehle puja naam kii mahila ke saath hui thi
 Baljit used to work as a contractor in Delhi Jal Board
 vah aksar kaam se baahar rahata tha
 During this time, his wife became misguided and his love affair with a young man started
 aae din ashu naamak uskaa premi balajit kii gairmaujuudagi main uske ghar aayaa jaaya karata tha
 Baljeet was completely unaware of this
 patni ko premi ke saath rangarelia manaate pakadapulice ke mutabik 24 april ko balajit roj kii tarah kaam par gaya tha
 He did not intend to come home at night
 lekin kaam khatm ho jane par wo achaanak raat ko apane ghar laut aayaa
 As soon as he entered the house, his eyes got torn
 uski patni aapattijanak haalat main apane premi aashu ke saath rangareliyaan manaa rahi thi
 Baljeet's blood boiled after seeing this scene
 darasal puja ko ummid nahin thi ki us din uskaa pati raat main ghar laut aayega
 But despite being caught red-handed, Pooja started quarreling with Baljeet instead of being ashamed of her mistake
 is bich ashu maukey kaa phayda uthaakar bhaag niklaa
 The wife hatched a creepy conspiracy that night, Baljeet's anger got cooled after the incident
 lekin uski patni puja ke dimag main pati ko hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye raste se hataane kii sajeesh janm le chuki thi
 She wanted to get rid of her husband
 usee raat puja ne apni sajeesh ke pehle hisse ko anjaam diya
 She added lots of sleeping pills to her husband to make him unconscious
 nateeja yah hua ki khaanaa khate hi balajit gahari neend main so gaya
 After this, Pooja called her lover Ashu
 or use puri sajeesh ke bare main bataaya
 After some time Ashu reached Pooja with her 3 companions
 galaa dabaakar kii pati kii hatyasbhi log kamare main daakhil hue or vahaan ashu or uske doston ke saath milakar puja ne ek chunni se apane pati balajit kaa galaa ghont diya
 When he is convinced that Baljeet is dead
 to puja kaa premi ashu apane doston sang faraar ho gaya
 After the incident, Pooja closed the door of the house and started watching TV sitting at the head of her husband Keelash
 do din pati kii laash ke saath bitaayeblajit ke katl ko anjaam dekar puja aaraam se baithkar tivi dekhati rahi or baad main aaraam se bed par so gai
 The next day she did not leave the house
 is tarah se puja ne 24 or 25 april kii raat apane pati kii laash ke saath ghar main rah kar bitaai
 Neither she came out of the house nor did she call anyone
 yahaan tak ki usne ghar kaa darwaja bhi lagaataar band hi rakhaa
 Two days had passed since the murder of her husband's body
 ab laash ko thikaane lagane kii baari thi
 For this work too, a dreadful plan had been formed in the mind of Pooja
 26 april ko puja ne phir se apane premi ashu ko bulaayaa
 And together with him, a sharpened weapon broke the pieces of her husband Baljeet's corpse
 laash kaa sir alag, dhad alag or haath pair bhi alag kar die
 Both of them hid Baljit's torso in a bag and buried the head inside the house by digging a hole in the floor of the room
 yahi nahin balajit ke haath-paanv ek tasale main dhank kar rakh die
 Rajpooja had done her conspiracy openly due to the arrival of siblings
 lekin laash ko tukade-tukade karne ke baavjood use thikaane nahin laga pai thi
 Meanwhile, looking for his brother, Baljit's second brother Kuljit Singh and sister Bajita reach his house
 jaise hi balajit ke parivaaravaalon ne ghar kaa daravaaza kholaa
 The brutal wife Kegunahki Tale opened up
 donon bhai bahan ghar kaa manjar or tasale main rakhe kate hue haath pair dekhakar kaanp uthe
 Both of them had to scream
 avaidh sambandhon ko lekar hoti thi takararbalajit ke parivaar ne bataaya ki balajit or puja kii shaadi saal 2012 main hui thi
 This was Pooja's second marriage
 donon kaa dhai saal kaa ek betaa bhi he
 But mian-biwi was often in dispute over Pooja's illicit relationship
 or puja pehle bhi balajit ko dhamka chuki thi
 According to the deceased's brother Kuljeet, Pooja had threatened to kill Baljeet once before
 kaatil patni giraftaarmaamle kaa khulaasa hote hi police maukey par pahunch gai
 Police recovered Baljit's body and arrested the accused wife Pooja
 balajit kii laash ke alag alag tukade dekhakar police vaale bhi hairaan rah gaye
 The body of the corpse was filled in a suitcase, then the head was buried in the ground
 haath pair tasale main rakhe the to kuch ang polithin main
 Jhajjar's DSP Dheeraj Kumar said that Pooja has been taken on a three-day police remand after presenting her in court

In protest, the left, Prakash Karat said - will protest shortly after the announcement of Rahul Gandhi contesting elections, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Rahul is coming to challenge the Left by contesting from Wayanad

 The people of Chapra will teach them a lesson
 sadhu ke maanane ke vishay main puche jane par unhone kaha ki ve kisi ko manaane nahin jaaengi
 Here, Sadhu, brother-in-law of RJD president Lalu Prasad, said on Wednesday, he was separated from his sister and brother-in-law for five years, treating us as untouchables
 mere liye koi parivaar nahin he
 He clearly said that i am not asking anyone anything
 unhone kaha ki ve saaran ja rahe hai or vahaan ke logon se raay lekar nirdaleey chunaav ladenge
 Lalu had said on Tuesday that it would not make any difference if the monk fought the election
 sadhu ke chunaav ladane se rajd kaa ek bhi vot nahin kategaa
 It is said that the sadhus were hoping for a ticket from the BJP, for which they had praised Modi and knocked on his door

 Laxman chased down the 216-run target set by Australia, managing India's innings almost alone as the experienced batsmen at the other end were getting out one by one due to poor shots and the umpire's wrong decisions
 lakshmana ne apni sadhi hui pari kii badaulat bharat ko behad yaadgaar test jeet dilaa di
 The second highest score in India's second innings was Sachin Tendulkar, who scored 38 runs

 With the victory today, India have now taken a 1-0 lead in the series and have saved the series chasing the seventh biggest goal in the history of the border-gavaskar Trophy
 ab donon tiimon ke bich doosraa or aakhri test match bangalore main nau aktubar se hoga
 Laxman, who used the runner in both innings, came to support Tendulkar this morning after the dismissal of Zaheer Khan, who landed on the ground as a night watchman
 tendulkar or lakshmana ne match kii najuk sthiti ko samajhate hue pari ko tej gati se aage badhaaya
 Despite battling injury, Laxman made beautiful shots from the beginning

 His cover drives and shots by the artisans were clear about his intentions
 lekin austrailian gendbaajon ne dabaav banaate hue subah ke satr ke pehle drinks brake se thik purv tendulkar ko out karke bharat ko karaara jhatka diya
 Tendulkar missed the ball off Bollinger in an attempt to make the upper cut and Mike Hussey took a brilliant catch in the lane

 Harbhajan Singh, who landed on the field after Dhoni, also did not face the Australian bowlers for much longer, and Bollinger sat on the ball going out and Ricky Ponting, standing on the second slip, made no mistake in catching the catch
 hyderaabadi ballebaaj lakshmana ne aaj phir sabit kiya ki unhen test cricket main bharat kaa stambh kyon kaha jaataa he
 Barely two months before today's brilliant innings, Laxman led India to victory with an unbeaten 103-run knock against Sri Lanka in the third Test match in Colombo
 lakshmana kaa balla hameshaa se hi austrailian team ke khilaaf jamkar bolaa he
 Who can forget the 2001 Test match in Kolkata, in which this artistic batsman's innings of 281 runs forced Australia to lose despite being followed

 Even if the Australian team wins in the second Test in Bangalore, the series will be equal and if it remains a Test draw or India wins, then the series will be in the name of Dhoni & Co

 But the question is why the people of Adva came for this demonstration, is there no discussion about the deceased girl in women's organizations within the other parties
 kya un mahila sanghathanon ko yahaan nahin hona chahie tha
 It was the same organization at the time of Nirbhaya and Kavita Krishnan was Aisa, these people were marched but later the Delhi people became a movement
 isamen bijepi ke netaa bhi aate the, duusare dalon ke netaa bhi aate the

 On 15 February, there was a rally in which people came out with the tricolor

 There is a video of February 15, in which people are shouting slogans to save the accused and police officers Khajuria

 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish the accused of Nirbhaya, but here the tricolor is in their hands, who want to save the accused rather than punish them

 a case of rape of a 6-year-old girl has been reported in Rohtas, Bihar

 In Kathua, where BJP leaders did not say that the accused should be killed, hanged, what language are BJP mps using in Rohtas, you hear
 wo to apni hi party kii sarkaar ko nikamma bataa rahe hai
 Why are the accused of murder and rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua being supported? rohtas main aaropee ko baandh kar maarane kii baat bijepi saansad isliye kar rahe hai ki wo muslim he
 Where have we come aaj soshal media main iti cell rohtas kii ghatana ko lekar sakriy he

 Thousands of people descended from Jantar Mantar to Raisina Hills and Rajpath
 dilli kii bahut si ladkiyaan jo kabhi kisi dharne main nahin gayi thim, pehali baar is dharne main gayi
 An officer from Karnal sent his daughter because his daughter wanted to go into the movement
 koi ladki apane aap ko roak nahin saki
 i still remember those girls from Lajpat Nagar
 unhone apane paise se poster chhapavaaye the, balaatkaar or stri hinsa ke khilaaf slogan likhe the, wo antim baar ke liye is zulm se azaad hone ke liye us hujum main ai thim
 Even his parents could not stop
 kisi ne sochaa nahin tha ki logon kaa jattha us raisina hills par kabza kar legaa jis par ab tak viipi kaaren chalaa karti thim yaa phir 26 janvari ke din tanks chalaa karte the
 Be it day or night, strong laws against rape, rape mentality, police negligence were all raising their voice
 us vakt kii sarkaar kii jubaan ladkadaane lagi thi
 a committee was formed under the leadership of Justice Verma, arrest was made, punishment was all done
 12 april kaa yah suraj raisina hills par na jane kisase munh chipa kar dub rahaa he
 This was the Raisina Hills at which thousands of people reached and aroused the sleeping government
 nita kaa camera jab rajpath kii taraf ghumta he tab sadaken khaali hai
 a few cars are disguised as silent chaps
 kya logon ne nirbhaya or kathua ke maamle main mazahab kaa koi hisaab kiya he
 Are people now starting to run away from their own movement that they do not have to come out for the girl child or have they stopped making a difference with the incidents of rape
 chah saal baad dilli kii in sadakon par pathar chal rahe hai, is sadak par gaadiyaan dikh rahi hai, magar nirbhaya ke liye nikle logon se ye jagah khaali hai
 Has our country changed so much that even the daughter of Kathua's victim is no more
 jantar mantar to ab logon ke liye nahin rahaa isliye sansad maarg par sipiem kii mahila sanghathan adva ke sadasyon ne yahaan pradarshan kiya
 But the question is why the people of Adva came for this demonstration, is there no discussion about the deceased girl in women's organizations within the other parties
 kya un mahila sanghathanon ko yahaan nahin hona chahie tha
 It was the same organization at the time of Nirbhaya and Kavita Krishnan was Aisa, these people were marched but later the Delhi people became a movement
 isamen bijepi ke netaa bhi aate the, duusare dalon ke netaa bhi aate the
 Today everyone is sitting in homes
 aisa nahin tha ki kathua ke maamle main bheed nahin ai
 On 15 February, there was a rally in which people came out with the tricolor
 yahi tirangaa kabhi nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko sazaa dene kii maang karne waalon ke haath main tha, magar aap dekh sakate hai ki yahaan aaropee pulicekarmi ko bachaane ke liye tirangaa lekar bheed ai hui he
 There is a video of February 15, in which people are shouting slogans to save the accused and police officers Khajuria
 logon ke haath main tirangaa he
 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish the accused of Nirbhaya, but here the tricolor is in their hands, who want to save the accused rather than punish them
 10 janvari ko kathua kii bacchee agava kii jaati he or uske kuch din baad hindu ekta manch kaa gathan hota he
 On February 17, a report by Mudasir Ahmed was published in The Wire in which Vijay Sharma, chief of Hindu Ekta Manch, said that Hindu Ekta Manch has been formed to protect against police harassment
 vir kii story ke hisaab se bijepi kii website se pataa chalata he ki vijay sharma party kaa rajya sachiv he
 So did the BJP leader create a Hindu unity platform to save the accused in this case? Vijay Sharma is also the head of Hindu Ekta Manch of Hiranagar Legislative Assembly
 isi raily main bijepi ke donon mantri bhi shaamil hai
 Forest and Environment Minister Lal Singh Chaudhary and Industry and Commerce Minister Chander Prakash are also included
 hindu ekta manch ne us vakt kaha tha ki jab tak aaropee chode nahin jaaenge unka andolan chalata rahegaa
 Chand Prakash Ganga definitely said that the girl child should get justice, humanity has been killed
 lekin jis tarah se ve jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai usase aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki ve us bheed ko bhi khush karnaa chaah rahe hai ki afasaron kii class lagavaayuungaa
 The crowd claps
 ve aropiyon kii umr ke aadhaar par sawaal karte hai
 Is the age of the four accused not different, which Chand Prakash ji is finding wrong
 hamaari sahyogi nita sharma ne bataaya he ki mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti dilli main grahamantri rajnath singh se mili hai
 Mehbooba has complained against these two ministers
 nita ke anusaar mukhyamantri ne kaha ki bijepi ke netaa jammu kashmir sarkaar ke liye pareshaani khadi kar rahe hai
 According to Neeta, the Home Minister said that the people who participated in this demonstration are not from the BJP
 jabaki tamaam report yah kah rahi he ki hindu ekta manch kii raily main bijepi ke do mantri shaamil hue the

 This sun of April 12 is drowning in the Raisina Hills with whom it is hiding
 yahi raisina hills thi jis par hazaron logon ne pahunch kar soti sarkaar ko jagaa diya tha
 Roads are empty when Neeta's camera turns towards Rajpath
 ikkaa dukka kaaren chup chaap nazaren chupa kar utar rahi hai
 Have people made any calculation of religion in the case of Nirbhaya and Kathua? kya log ab apane hi us andolan se bhaagane lage hai ki kahin unhen bacchee ke liye baahar na nikalnaa pade yaa phir unhen balaatkaar kii ghatnaon se fark padana band ho gaya he
 Six years later, stones are running on these streets of Delhi, vehicles are seen on this road, but these places are empty of people who have left for Nirbhaya
 kya hamaara desh itnaa badal gaya he ki uske liye kathua kii peedita beti bhi nahin rahi
 Jantar Mantar is no longer for the people, so members of cpm's women's organization Adwa demonstrated here on Parliament Street
 par sawaal he ki is pradarshan ke liye adva ke hi log kyon aae, kya baaki dalon ke bheetar mahila sanghathanon main mritak bacchee ko lekar koi charchaa nahin he
 Shouldn't those women's organizations have been here
 nirbhaya ke vakt bhi yahi sanghathan tha or kavita krishnan thi isa kii, in logon kaa march hua tha magar baad main dilli ke logon kaa andolan ban gaya tha
 BJP leaders also used to come in this, leaders of other parties also used to come
 aaj sab gharon main baithe hai
 It was not that there was no rush in the case of Kathua
 15 farvari ko ek raily hui thi jisamen log tirangaa lekar nikle the
 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish Nirbhaya's accused, but you can see that there is a crowd carrying the tricolor to save the accused policeman
 15 farvari kaa video he, jisamen log aaropee or police adhikari khajuriya ko bachaane ke liye naare laga rahe hai
 People have the tricolor in their hands
 yahi tirangaa kabhi nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko sazaa dene kii maang karne waalon ke haath main tha, magar yahaan tirangaa unke haath main he jo aaropee ko sazaa nahin balki bachaana chaahate hai
 On 10 January, Kathua's child is abducted and a few days later the Hindu Ekta Manch is formed
 di vir main 17 farvari ko mudasir ahamed kii ek report chhapi thi jisamen hindu ekta manch ke pramukh vijay sharma ne kaha tha ki police utpeedan se bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 According to the Wire's story, bjp's website shows that Vijay Sharma is the party's state secretary
 to kya bijepi ke netaa ne is cese ke aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch banaaya? vijay sharma hiranagar vidhansabha ke hindu ekta manch kaa pramukh bhi he
 Both BJP ministers are also involved in this rally
 van evam paryaavaran mantri laal singh choudhary or udyog va vaanijya mantri chander prakaash bhi shaamil hai
 The Hindu Ekta Manch had said at the time that their agitation would go on till the accused are released
 chand prakaash ganga ne zarur kaha ki bacchee ko insaaf milanaa chahie, insaaniyat kaa katl hua he
 But the way they are questioning the investigation, you can guess that they also want to please the crowd that i will get a class of officers
 bheed tali bajaati he
 They question the age of the accused
 kya chaar aropiyon kii umr alag alag nahin hoti he jo ye baat chand prakaash ji ko galat lag rahi he
 Our colleague Nita Sharma has told that Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has met Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi
 mahabuuba ne in do mantriyon ke kilaaf shikaayat kii he
 According to Neeta, the Chief Minister said that BJP leaders are creating problems for the Jammu and Kashmir government
 nita ke mutabik grahamantri ne kaha ki is pradarshan main shaamil hue log bijepi se nahin hai
 While all the reports are saying that two BJP ministers attended the rally of Hindu Ekta Manch
 vijay sharma ke bare main bhi di vir kii report bataati he ki vah bijepi kaa rajya sachiv he or hiranagar hindu ekta manch kaa pramukh bhi he
 The statement of PMO Minister of State Jitendra Singh was published in the Tribune of 22 February, which was later published by Scroll
in
 piemo main rajya mantri jitend singh ne kaha tha ki agar logon kaa bharosa police or krime branch kii jaanch main nahin he to yah cese sibiai ko de dena chahie

 Did Ram Madhav ask Lal Singh and Chand Prakash Ganga why they were again raising questions during the inquiry in the meeting of Hindu Ekta Manch
 hindu ekta manch ke netaa unki party ke hai yaa nahin
 What was needed to bring the Hindu unity platform forward to save the accused

 kya un mahila sanghathanon ko yahaan nahin hona chahie tha
 It was the same organization at the time of Nirbhaya and Kavita Krishnan was Aisa, these people were marched but later the Delhi people became a movement

 There is a video of February 15, in which people are shouting slogans to save the accused and police officers Khajuria

 So did the BJP leader create a Hindu unity platform to save the accused in this case? Vijay Sharma is also the head of Hindu Ekta Manch of Hiranagar Legislative Assembly
 isi raily main bijepi ke donon mantri bhi shaamil hai
 Forest and Environment Minister Lal Singh Chaudhary and Industry and Commerce Minister Chander Prakash are also included
 hindu ekta manch ne us vakt kaha tha ki jab tak aaropee chode nahin jaaenge unka andolan chalata rahegaa
 Chand Prakash Ganga definitely said that the girl child should get justice, humanity has been killed
 lekin jis tarah se ve jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai usase aap andaaza laga sakate hai ki ve us bheed ko bhi khush karnaa chaah rahe hai ki afasaron kii class lagavaayuungaa

 According to Neeta, the Home Minister said that the people who participated in this demonstration are not from the BJP
 jabaki tamaam report yah kah rahi he ki hindu ekta manch kii raily main bijepi ke do mantri shaamil hue the
 The Wire's report on Vijay Sharma also states that he is the state secretary of the BJP and is also the head of the Hiranagar Hindu Ekta Manch

 In the PMO, Minister of State Jitendra Singh had said that if people do not have faith in the investigation of the police and the crime branch, then this case should be given to the CBI

 ' The mid-march 12, 2018 news that BJP national vice-president Avinash Rai Khanna also supported the CBI investigation
 aapane 11 april ke prime time main hamaare sahyogi zafar iqbaal kii report main bijepi pravaktaa sunil sethi bhi police jaanch par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 The question should be whether Hindu Ekta Manch is fighting for the justice of the girl child or to save the accused officials
 bijepi kaise kah sakati he ki uske netaa hindu ekta manch ke saath nahin hai
 While its ministers have been involved in Hindu Ekta Manch rally
 uski maang kaa samarthan karte rahe hai
 If the BJP had so much faith in the CBI investigation, why did it not become serious? sibiai jaanch ke aadesh kyon nahin hue
 Mehbooba Mufti is adamant that her own police will investigate
 unhone twit kiya he ki 'gair zimmedaar bayaan se kanoon kaa kaam prabhavit nahin hoga

 police saamne se nahin kah rahi he ki sikh adhikariyon ko isliye rakhaa ja rahaa he taaki aropiyon ke pakshdhar ko vishwaas ho sake
 The case was being investigated under the supervision of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court
 ramesh jallaa jo ki khud kashmiri pandit hai or kaabil afasar nahin hote to inspector se esaspi ke pad tak nahin pahunchate
 The SIT was conducting an investigation under his supervision, which was led by another capable officer, Naveed Pirzada
 is team ko 90 dinon main chargeshit taiyaar kerani thi magar 10 din pehle hi taiyaar kar lee
 Questions are also being raised about this
 kya kanoon main likhaa he ki 90wein din hi report taiyaar hogi, 90 din to samay seemaa he
 Jalla, who hails from Sringar, joined as an Inspector of Police in 1984
 unhone chargeshit daayar karne ke baad asia times ke reporter maajid hydari se kaha he ki do maheene ke baad ab main chaiyn kii neend so paaya hum
 In August 2016, Ramesh Jalla was awarded sher-e-kashmir Police Medal for outstanding work
 ramesh jalla par aatankwaadi hamalaa bhi hua he or ve kai maheene tak aspataal main rahe hai
 If the police team has made the police officers accused, then what is the problem of Hindu Ekta Manch
 bijepi ke netaaon ko kyon shaq he
 Even if in doubt, what is the function of the tricolor in it
 agar kal koi muslim sanghathan yah maang karne lage ki bacchee kii maut kii jaanch ke liye hindu adhikariyon par bharosa nahin he, tab is rajya vyavastha kii kya saakh rah jaaegi, kya ham yahaan tak aa pahunche hai ki har samudaay ko apni ghatana kii jaanch ke liye apane samudaay kaa adhikari chahie hoga
 Our leaders are quick to speak

 At each hearing, the Crime Branch has submitted a status report
 hoicourt ne aropiyon ko arest karne ke aadesh diye
 The lawyers and political parties were resisting arrest even after court supervision
 kya isliye ve jai shri ram kaa naaraa laga sakate the, haath main tirangaa lekar aa sakate hai
 The court was so crowded that it took six hours for the police to hand over the charge sheet to the magistrate
 ye he nayaa india
 Which has a crowd that is on standby everywhere like the Rapid Action Force
 yah bheed pehle tirangaa lekar aati he, baar baar tirange ke sammaan kaa sawaal uthaati he, is tirange ko pehle uniwarsity main tonga gaya taaki vahaan rashtrawaad faile magar jaldi hi bheed ne us tirange ko apana naqaab bana liya
 So that you do not see the face of the crowd due to respect for the tricolor
 news channelon or whatsap uniwarsity ke zarie hindu muslim dibet se faili nafrat is bheed main bhari hoti he
 Now this crowd is everywhere

 You see the tricolor, and do we also respect that tricolor wholeheartedly
 magar aap bheed ke paanv dekhie
 Where is he willing to go kahaan aag lagane ke taiyaar he
 Looking at you from the face, move towards the face, the intention of this mob will be seen and you will regret that your beloved tricolor is used to save the accused of rape

 There are no marks, but there is a story

 Amidst the silence of the Prime Minister, this statement of VK Singh is true but it is ointment

 Why do leaders take so long to make this statement? isi 21 farvari ko australia main ek bacchee ke saath balaatkaar kii ghatana hui
 The government there apologized

 ram madhav ne fasebuk par likhaa he ki ek april ko jammu kashmir rajya kii bijepi kaaryakarini main prastaav paas hua tha ki naaballig ke jaghanya balaatkaar kii ninda kii jaati he
 Such crimes are inhumane
 inke sampradayik banane ke kisi bhi prayaas kii ninda karne kii jarurat he
 The perpetrators of the crime should be punished according to the law and should not harass the innocent
 kya ram madhav ne laal singh or chand prakaash ganga se poocha tha ki ve hindu ekta manch kii sabha main jaanch main phir kyon sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Whether the leader of Hindu Ekta Manch belongs to his party or not
 aaropee ko bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch ko aage laane kii kya zarurat thi
 Who brought the Hindu unity platform forward, only Mehbooba Mufti can tell it better
 umr abdulla ne kaha he ki bijepi ke do mantriyon ke ishaare par bheed bekaabu hui
 When will action be taken against them? agar mahabuuba in do mantriyon kii shikaayat grahamantri se karne ain thim to ve karrwai kab karengi
 Rahul Gandhi has tweeted, 'how can anyone defend the guilty of such a crime
 yah maanavtaa ke khilaaf aparaadh he
 What have we become? If we allow politics to interfere in unimaginable cruelty with an innocent girl? 'comments aap apane bachche se zarur puuchhie ki kahin wo is nafrat ke saath to nahin he
 Don't be late varna wo bhi kisi din is bheed main shaamil hokar aparaadh kar baithegaa
 a case of rape of a 6-year-old girl has been reported in Rohtas, Bihar
 jo aaropee giraftaar hua he wo muslim he
 In Kathua, where BJP leaders did not say that the accused should be killed, hanged, what language are BJP mps using in Rohtas, you hear
 wo to apni hi party kii sarkaar ko nikamma bataa rahe hai
 Why are the accused of murder and rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua being supported? rohtas main aaropee ko baandh kar maarane kii baat bijepi saansad isliye kar rahe hai ki wo muslim he
 Where have we come aaj soshal media main iti cell rohtas kii ghatana ko lekar sakriy he
 He is asking in the same way, why do you talk about the child of Kathua, why do you talk about the girl of Rohtas
 iti cell kii maansikta insaan ko darinda bana detii he
 Makes the same murder justified and illegitimate according to religion
 pradhanmantri bataaen ki saansad chhedi paswan kii baat sahi he yaa sibiai jaanch kii maang karne vaale vidhayak laal singh kii baat sahi he
 It was not that there was no rush in the case of Kathua
 15 farvari ko ek raily hui thi jisamen log tirangaa lekar nikle the
 This tricolor was once in the hands of those seeking to punish Nirbhaya's accused, but you can see that there is a crowd carrying the tricolor to save the accused policeman
 15 farvari kaa video he, jisamen log aaropee or police adhikari khajuriya ko bachaane ke liye naare laga rahe hai
 People have the tricolor in their hands
 yahi tirangaa kabhi nirbhaya ke aropiyon ko sazaa dene kii maang karne waalon ke haath main tha, magar yahaan tirangaa unke haath main he jo aaropee ko sazaa nahin balki bachaana chaahate hai
 On 10 January, Kathua's child is abducted and a few days later the Hindu Ekta Manch is formed
 di vir main 17 farvari ko mudasir ahamed kii ek report chhapi thi jisamen hindu ekta manch ke pramukh vijay sharma ne kaha tha ki police utpeedan se bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 According to the Wire's story, bjp's website shows that Vijay Sharma is the party's state secretary
 to kya bijepi ke netaa ne is cese ke aropiyon ko bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch banaaya? vijay sharma hiranagar vidhansabha ke hindu ekta manch kaa pramukh bhi he
 Both BJP ministers are also involved in this rally
 van evam paryaavaran mantri laal singh choudhary or udyog va vaanijya mantri chander prakaash bhi shaamil hai
 The Hindu Ekta Manch had said at the time that their agitation would go on till the accused are released
 chand prakaash ganga ne zarur kaha ki bacchee ko insaaf milanaa chahie, insaaniyat kaa katl hua he
 But the way they are questioning the investigation, you can guess that they also want to please the crowd that i will get a class of officers
 bheed tali bajaati he
 They question the age of the accused
 kya chaar aropiyon kii umr alag alag nahin hoti he jo ye baat chand prakaash ji ko galat lag rahi he
 Our colleague Nita Sharma has told that Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has met Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi
 mahabuuba ne in do mantriyon ke kilaaf shikaayat kii he
 According to Neeta, the Chief Minister said that BJP leaders are creating problems for the Jammu and Kashmir government

 The statement of PMO Minister of State Jitendra Singh was published in the Tribune of 22 February, which was later published by Scroll
in

 In the report of our colleague Zafar Iqbal in the prime time of April 11, BJP spokesperson Sunil Sethi is also questioning the police investigation
 sawaal yah hona chahie ki hindu ekta manch bacchee ke insaaf ke liye lard rahaa he yaa aaropee adhikariyon ko bachaane ke liye
 How can BJP say that its leaders are not with the Hindu Ekta Manch
 jabaki uske mantri hindu ekta manch kii raily main shaamil rahe hai
 Has been supportive of his demand
 agar bijepi kii sibiai jaanch par itnaa hi bharosa tha wo gambhir kyon nahin hui
 Why did the CBI inquiry not be ordered? mahabuuba mufti is baat par adi hai ki jaanch unki hi police karegi
 He tweeted that 'lawless work will not be affected by the irresponsible statement

 The police is not saying from the front that Sikh officers are being kept so that the accused of the accused can be trusted
 is cese kii jaanch jammu kashmir hoicourt kii nigaraanee main ho rahi thi
 Ramesh Jalla, who is a Kashmiri Pandit himself and is not a competent officer, would not have reached the rank of Inspector from SSP
 unki nigaraanee main esaiti jaanch kar rahi thi jiskaa netritv ek or kaabil afasar navid peerzada kar rahe the
 This team had to prepare the charge sheet in 90 days but got ready 10 days in advance

 In February, the girl's family had approached the High Court for an impartial inquiry
 prayek sunwaayee main krime branch ne states report jamaa kiya he
 The High Court ordered the arrest of the accused

 ram madhav ne fasebuk par likhaa he ki ek april ko jammu kashmir rajya kii bijepi kaaryakarini main prastaav paas hua tha ki naaballig ke jaghanya balaatkaar kii ninda kii jaati he
 Such crimes are inhumane
 inke sampradayik banane ke kisi bhi prayaas kii ninda karne kii jarurat he
 The perpetrators of the crime should be punished according to the law and should not harass the innocent
 kya ram madhav ne laal singh or chand prakaash ganga se poocha tha ki ve hindu ekta manch kii sabha main jaanch main phir kyon sawaal uthaa rahe the
 Whether the leader of Hindu Ekta Manch belongs to his party or not
 aaropee ko bachaane ke liye hindu ekta manch ko aage laane kii kya zarurat thi
 Who brought the Hindu unity platform forward, only Mehbooba Mufti can tell it better
 umr abdulla ne kaha he ki bijepi ke do mantriyon ke ishaare par bheed bekaabu hui

 In Kathua, where BJP leaders did not say that the accused should be killed, hanged, what language are BJP mps using in Rohtas, you hear
 wo to apni hi party kii sarkaar ko nikamma bataa rahe hai
 Why are the accused of murder and rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua being supported? rohtas main aaropee ko baandh kar maarane kii baat bijepi saansad isliye kar rahe hai ki wo muslim he
 Where have we come aaj soshal media main iti cell rohtas kii ghatana ko lekar sakriy he
 He is asking in the same way, why do you talk about the child of Kathua, why do you talk about the girl of Rohtas

 Union Communications and IT Minister Kapil Sibal has rejected every argument of BJP leader and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi in an article
 ek english newspaper ke liye likhe is lekh main sibbal kehete hai ki modi driver or papi kii baat kar rahe hai, khud ko hindu bataa rahe hai
 But a good Hindu would have fired a driver who had been negligent in such a situation
 is lekh main sibbal ne kai baar kutark bhi barte hai
 But before talking to them, let us see who Sibal advocated and how he was convicted by Modi
 cese number 1 papi, driver or peeche kii sitmodi ne kaha tha ki ‘main insaan hum
 Even if someone else is driving the car and i am sitting behind, and in such a case that someone falls under the car and dies, i will still be sad
 ’ is par sibbal kaa kahana he ki papi do hi haalat main mar saktaa he
 First, he hit the road and deceived the car
 aise main na to driver or na hi peeche baitha shaks gunahagaar hoga
 Second, if the accident occurred when the driver drove the car at a high speed
 tab peeche baitha shaks kya karegaa
 What would a good Hindu do? driver ko naukari se nikaal degaa
 Will register an FIR
 magar is maamle main khud ko car main peeche baitha bataa rahe modi ne to newton kaa kriya pratikriya kaa niyam samajhaayaa or police jaanch ko lagaataar prabhavit karte rahe
 Case No
 2 Secularism Means Bharat Parmalodi says, 'my secularism means India first
 or bijepi ke liye iskaa matlab he sabhi ko nyaay or tushtikaran kisi kaa nahin
 'advocate Sibal argues that patriotism has nothing to do with secularism
 ek sampradayik aadmi bhi deshbhakt ho saktaa he
 And the matter of the logic of justice for all of BJP, the way justice has been consistently denied in the post-godhra riots, their pole is exposed
 cese number 3 aalochana karo, iljaam mat lagaomodi ne kaha tha ki ‘main maanata hum ki loktantr aalochana ke dam par swasth rahata he
 But i am against accusation
 ’ is par sibbal counter karte hai ki modi pichley kai barason se congress ke khilaaf basir pair ke iljaam laga rahe hai
 For example, they are saying that the Congress is using the CBI against them unnecessarily
 jabaki sach yah he ki sibiai yaa to rajya sarkaar yaa court ke kehane par hi maamle kii jaanch karti he
 In the case of Gujarat, the CBI is investigating on the orders of the court
 magar modi logon se yah sach chipa jate hai
 Case number 4 BJP Mission, Congress Commission Modi had said that 'BJP is party with mission, while Congress party with commission'
 is par kapil sibbal ne narendra modi ko kaha ki bijepi bilashak mishan vaali party he
 But its mission is to carry out state-protected violence, fake encounters
 rahi kamishan kii baat, to gujarat main hue kaamon main kitna kamishan kahaan gaya, ye pataa na chal paae isliye modi lokayukta kii niyukti kaa virodh karte rahe hai
 Case No
 5 i am a Hindu and a nationalist
 bakaul sibbal modi kehete hai ki ‘main hindu rashtravaadi hum kyonki maine hindu ke rup main janm liya
 'here Sibal's sophomores are directly exposed
 modi se sawaal poocha gaya tha ki aap hindu rashtravaadi hai yaa bijness manager
 On this, he chose the first option and said that i am a Hindu, because i was born in this religion
 or mere liye desh sabase upar he isliye main rashtravaadi hum
 But Sibal did this by cutting the context and then started his advocacy
 unhone kaha ki modi deshbhakti or rashtrawaad kaa fark nahin samajhate hai
 Modi feels that every person born in Hinduism is a Hindu nationalist
 jabaki main bizzat kahana chahta hum ki hindu dharm main paidaa hue kuch log rashtravirohi hai
 Nationalism has nothing to do with religion

 But over twenty years the tower's popularity grew so much that the idea of demolishing it was scrapped

 Cricket fans are eyeing the ICC Champions Trophy starting June 1
 usase pehle hi indian team ke phens ke liye ek buree khabar aa rahi he
 India's playing in the Champions Trophy is in crisis
 iskaa kaaran bisisiai or isisi ke bich vivaadit ‘big thri formule’ ko mana ja rahaa he
 Negotiations between the officials of the two boards over the 'big Three formula' have not been resolved and if India decides to withdraw from the Champions Trophy, it will cause big loss to world cricket
 big thri formula teen desho (bharat, australia or england) ke board ke hissedari or sabhi deshon se zyada laabh lene ke liye banaaya hua he
 As per the new ICC rules, it has been decided to limit India's share in the earnings of any ICC tournament as well as its official strength
 jisase bisisiai naaraaz he
 Currently, the IPL is going on in India
 21 may ko iskaa final muqabla khelaa jayega uske thik 10 din baad champions trophy kaa aagaaj hoga
 If everything goes well, India's first match is scheduled to play against Pakistan on June 4
 bharat or pakistan ke bich lambey samay se cricket siries dekhne ko nahin mili he or cricket premiyon ko is match kaa intjaar tha
 India has won the Champions Trophy twice in 2002 (joint winner) and 2013
 philhal champions trophy main ek maheene kaa vakt he

 congress kaa ghoshnaa-patr 90 ke baad kii aarthik nitiyon kii raajnneeti kaa rasta badalane kaa sanket de rahaa he
 The possibilities of liberalization policy are now limited
 isamen pichley das saal se aisa kuch nahin dikhaa jisase lage ki pehle kii tarah zyaada virgon ko ab yah laabh de sakati he
 Rather all the figures are showing upside down
 100 karod se adhik aabaadi vaale desh main kul sampattiyon kaa 70 fisadi ek pratishat aabaadi ke baad chalaa gaya he
 This one percent has contributed to the interests of the state with its accumulated resources
 aaj privet job kii sthiti par charchaa ched dijie, dukhon kaa aasmaan fat padegaa, aap sambhaal nahin paaenge
 We are at a turning point today
 hamen rajya ke sansaadhan, kshamta or karporate ke anubhavon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karnaa chahie
 The filling of the corporate by demolishing it at the cost of one did not benefit the wider population
 modi raaj main karporate ne agar naukariyon kaa srijan kiya hota to sthiti badtar na hoti
 But now the corporate has only the idea of generating delivery buys by taxi and bike
 udaarikaran ne har tarah se rajya ko khokhla kiya he
 The state expanded resources but not capabilities
 aaj rajya kaa bajet pehle kii tulana main kai lakh karod kaa he
 But on their own, the state did not develop the capacity to serve the public
 sarkari sector main rojgaar ghat gaya
 Became cheap thekedaaron kii mouj hui or theke par naukari karne waalon ke hisse sazaa ai
 In this context, the Congress manifesto is moving the resources of the state towards developing the capacity of the state
 yah nayaa idia nahin he magar yahi behatar idia he
 Congress has promised 6000 per month to 5 crore poor families
 modi sarkaar ke aarthik surveykshan me yah baat 2016 main aa gai magar sarkaar soti rahi
 When Rahul Gandhi teased the discussion, in a short time, a plan came to give 6000 to 10 crore farmers in a year
 yah pramaan he ki aam logon kaa jivan str bahut karaab he
 So bad that when given cylinders under the Ujjwala scheme, they are not able to buy cylinders again
 silendar rakhaa he or bagal main lakdi ke chuulhe par khaanaa pak rahaa he
 We have seen one and a half year job series
 har rajya apradhi hai
 Examination commissions are a plan to ruin the lives of the youth
 iskaa matlab he ki rahul gandhi ne is baat ko dekh liya he
 The central government has promised to fill 4 lakh jobs in a year
 wo bhi chunaav khatm ho jane ke baad bharaa jayega
 The Modi government stopped hiring for five years
 chunaav aayaa to aanan-fanan main railway kii vekency nikaali
 Before that the Supreme Court kept reprimanding the states from the center that 5 lakh posts are vacant in the police force, give a road map of their recruitment
 zaahir he is berojgaare ko bhi sarkaar or rajya sarkaron kii aapraadhik laaparvaahee ne bhi bada kiya he
 Rahul is also talking about forcing states to give jobs
 unhen centre se fund tabhi milegaa jab ve apane yahaan kii bees lakh naukariyon ko bharenge
 Some employment-related promises are even more important
 12 maheene ke bheetar anusuchit jati, janajati or obisi ke khaali padon ko bharne kaa vaada kiya gaya he
 Misconceptions are spread about reservation, but it is never found
 indian express kii report thi
 In 23 iits, there are only 170 faculty of reserved category in 6043 faculty
 maatr teen pratishat
 The same situation is there at Central University
 har jagah he
 If these posts are filled within 12 months, then several thousand youths will get jobs
 iske alaava sarvice rule main badlaav kar centre sarkaar kii bhartiyon main 33 pratishat pad mahilaon ke liye arakshit karne kii baat he
 It has been underlined since the 90s that SC, ST and OBC, minority representation in the judiciary is very less
 kam kahana bhi zyaada he
 Actually negligible
 congress ne vaada kiya he ki vah isamen sudhaar karegi or unke pratinidhitiv kaa str badhayegi
 Poor upper castes have got reservation in Modi government
 wo ab dekhenge ki rajya kabhi unke aarakshan ko lekar gambhir nahin rahegaa
 When this is the situation of representation of politically powerful sections like Dalit and OBC, then what will the poor upper castes get
 udaarikaran ke baad bharat main sarkari ucch shiksha vyavastha ko dhwast kar diya gaya
 It has ten years of Congress and ten years of Vajpayee and Modi of BJP as well
 desh bhar main hazaron kii sankhya main ajeeb-ajeeb privet santhaan khole gaye
 Despite the expensive fees, barely ten of these thousands of institutions were even ranked
 jabaki inhen rajya ne kitna kuch diya
 Taking land from farmers, gave them land at low prices
 baad ye log uniwarsity band kar usamen alag alag dukaan kholte rahe
 Only a few people became stronger in this process
 iske paise se rajya sabha or loksabhaa kaa tikat kareed kar sansad main pahunch gaye
 The economic burden of demolishing the college in the districts and towns was borne by the youth
 unki yogyata kaa vistaar nahin hua
 Which made less money and if they came to the capitals and Delhi, then they had to spend millions for that education, which made them worse
 rahul gandhi ne kaha he ki ve sarkari kalejon kaa network banaaenge
 Will spend 6 percent on education
 yahi rasta he
 There is no other way to save the youth of the village towns from poverty while studying
 nyaaypalika ke kshetra main congress kaa ghoshnaa patr nai bahes chedhta he
 The Congress has said that it will set up six appeals courts across the country
 rajyon ke hoicourt ke faisle ko chunauti dene ke liye desh bhar se sabhi ko dilli nahin aana hoga
 His case can be settled by these appeals courts in between
 isse supreme court kaa insaaf or saamaanya logon tak pahonchega
 Why did Hardik Patel have to come to the Supreme Court for appeal? On the same lines, the demand for geographical expansion of the High Court Bench within the states can be strong
 congress ko yah bhi dekhnaa tha
 The demand for separate benches in Meerut is reasonable
 is baat kaa bhi dhyaan rakhana tha
 It is a matter of giving constitutional court status to the Supreme Court
 alag alag benchon se guzarate hue sanvaidhanik maamle bahut samay lete hai
 Explain the fundamental right or the case of Ram temple
 maamla choti bench se badi bench or usase bhi badi bench main ghoomte rahata he or alag alag vyakhyaayein saamne aati rahati hai
 You must have seen that all the judges sit together in the Supreme Court of America and hear and settle the case
 sanvaidhanik maamalon kaa faisla isi tarah se hona chahie
 This debate is old, but the Congress has promised that it wants to change the structure of the state and the judiciary
 congress ne 17veen loksabhaa ke pehle hi satr main unmaadi bheed dwaara aagjanee, hatya jaise nafrat bhare aparaadhon kii rokthaam or dandit karne ke liye nayaa kanoon banane kaa vaada kiya he
 It is a bold promise of the Congress that it will close the electoral bond formed by the Modi government
 yah skim apaardarshee he
 It is not known who has contributed more than 1000 crores to the BJP
 sari bahes thi ki chanda dene vaale kaa naam paardarshee ho, magar kanoon bana ulta
 Apart from this, Congress has promised to set up National Election Fund
 jisamen koi bhi yogadan kar saktaa he
 It is better to discuss them all
 mere lihaaz se congress ne apane ghoshnaa patr main media ko lekar jo vaada kar diya he us par gaur kiya janaa chahie
 Currently the oil company buys a hundred channels
 khanan company vaala raaton raat ek channel khadaa karata he, chatukaarita karata he or sarkaar se laabh lekar channel band kar gaayab ho jaataa he
 This is called cross ownership
 is beemaari ke kaaran ek hi audyogic gharaane kaa alag party kii rajya main khushaamad kar rahaa he to duusari party kii sarkaar ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaa rahaa he
 Journalism crisis will not be solved by any anchor
 cross onership kii beemaari ko dur karne se hoga
 The media will not pursue this debate
 yah bahes hogi to aam janata ko iske kaale dhandhe kaa pattern pataa chal jayega
 The Congress has said it will pass legislation to "prevent monopoly in the media so that media cannot be controlled by cross ownership of various sectors and other business organizations"
 " aaj ek bijness gharaane ke paas darjanon channel ho gaye hai
 The work of suppressing the voice of the people and imposing the government's nonsense on the people day and night is being done through these channels and newspapers
 agar aap bhaajapa ke samarthak hai or congress ke ghoshnaa patr se sahamat nahin hai to bhi is pahalu kii charchaa jor jor se kiijie taaki media main badlaav aae
 In 2008, Congress saw this crisis, a report was prepared but nothing was done
 2014 ke baad congress ne is sankat ko or gahare tareeke se dekh liya he
 In five years, opposition was eliminated through media
 uskaa kaaran yahi cross swaamitv tha
 Now the Congress has understood
 magar kya vah un bade audyogic gharaanon se takaraa paaegi jinka desh kii raajnneeti par kabza ho gaya he
 He has become the grandfather of the leaders
 pradhanmantri tak unke saamne majaboor lagate hai
 Remember me congress bhale vaada kar kuch na kar paae, magar yah ek aisa khatara he jise dur karne ke liye aaj na kal bharat kii janata ko khadaa hona padegaa
 Whether i stay in the media or not, but this day will come
 janata ko apni awaz ke liye media se sangharsh karnaa padegaa
 i want to see Rahul Gandhi fighting on this one front
 bhale ve haar jaaen magar apane ghoshnaa patr main kiye hue vaade ko janata ke bich pahunchaa den or bada mudda bana den
 You also pressurize the Congress
 rose use is vaade kii yaad dilaaein
 It will be good for India
 aapkaa bhala hoga

 Input: PTI cheteshwar pujaara (naabad 111) or captain gautam gambhir (94) kii shandaar pariyon kii madad se india blue ne dalip trophy ke final match ke pehle din shanivaar ko india red ke khilaaf thos shuruyaat kii
 In the final match of the day-night Duleep Trophy being played with a pink ball for the first time at the Shaheed Vijay Singh Pathik Cricket Stadium, India Blue have scored 362 runs, losing three wickets till the end of the day's play
 pujaara ke saath dinesh karthik 55 ran banaakar naabad laute
 Pujara smashed a century, Gambhir played a 94-run innings and gave India an excellent start by Gambhir and Mayank Agarwal (54)
 donon ne pehle wicket ke liye 144 ran jode
 Both batsmen continued to bat brilliantly as in the previous match and for the fourth consecutive century in the tournament
 gambhir kaa yah is toornament main lagatarchauthaa ardhashtakahai
 He unfortunately could not convert it to a century
 is khatarnaak jodi ko harfanmaulaa stuart binni ne todaa
 He got Mayank caught out by Shikhar Dhawan
 duusare chor par gambhir ne kuch achche shot lagaae or lag rahaa tha ki vah is baar apana shatak puraa kar lenge, lekin chinamen kuldeep yadav kii gend ko cat karne ke prayaas main gend unke balle kaa andruni kinaaraa lete hue viketon par ja lagi
 Gambhir, who bowled out for a total of 178, hit eight fours off 145 balls to lead the innings with Rohit Sharma (30) Nepuzara who was included in the team for the final match between Pujara and Karthik
 donon ne sanyam se khelte hue tisare wicket ke liye 64 ran jode or team kaa score 242 tak pahunchaaya
 But then Rohit got caught by Dhawan in an attempt to sweep the leg of spinner Amit Mishra
 pujaara ek chor par date rahe or duusare chor par unhen kisi ke lambey saath kii jarurat thi
 Karthik supported him well and remained on the wicket till the end of the day's play
 donon ballebaajon ke bich main chauthe wicket ke liye 120 ranon kii saajhedaari ho chuki he
 This pair has 5
 10 kii tej ran gati se yah saajhedaari nibhaai
 In his century innings, Pujara has faced 164 balls so far and has hit 15 fours
 vahiin karthik ne ab tak 68 gendon main aath chauke lagaae hai

 photo: duusare vanade main team india ne england ko di karaari matbharat agar 3-0 kii nirnaayak badhat hasil kar letaa he to vah england main vanade shrinkhalaa main mili haar kaa badla bhi chuktaa kar legaa jabaki isi daure par hue ‘whitewash’ kii niraashaa ko bhi kuch had tak peeche chhod degaa
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team had an easy win in the first two matches played in Hyderabad and Delhi
 hyderabad main pehle vanade main mejabaan team ne 126 jabaki dilli main duusare match main aath wicket se jeet hasil kii
 India's youth team would like to retain their dominance against England
 pehle vanade main england ke khilaaf dhoni-raina kaa dhamaltim ko is baat se bhi prerana milegi ki vah 2-0 kii badhat ke saath isisi ekadivasiy ranking main england ko pachhadkar chauthe sthaan par pahunch gaya he or ek or jeet ke saath is sthaan par uskaa daawa majboot ho jayega
 The wicket of the third match, however, is expected to help the fast bowler more than the spinners
 ajtak LIVE TV dekhne ke liye clic karenchot ke kaaran sachin tendulkar, virendra sahvaag or jahir khan jaise senior khilaadiyon kii gairmaujuudagi main team ko jeet dilaane kii jimmedaari youth brigade par thi jisane pehle do maichon main niraash nahin kiya
 The BCCI also retained the same team for the remaining three matches after that
 kharaab farm se jujh rahe harbhajan singh kii ek baar phir andekhi kii gai he jiske kaaran bharat ke anubhavheen gendbaaji akraman kii aguai ek baar phir tej gendbaaj praveen kumaar karenge
 Despite heavy pressure, India's inexperienced fast bowlers have done well so far
 praveen kumaar ne dhardaar gendbaaji kii he jabaki yuva umesh yadav ne apni teji or wicket lene kii kshamta se prabhavit kiya he
 Yadav has however spent more runs
 aar vinayakumar ne bich ke overon main sahyogi kii behtareen bhoomika nibhaai he or dilli main chaar wicket chatkaakar bharat ko jeet dilaane main unka ahm yogadan tha
 This fast bowling pair of India will now be desperate to bowl on the wicket of Mohali, who is known for his speed and bounce
 shrinkhalaa main ab tak chaar-chaar wicket chatka chuke aar aswin or ravindra jadeja ne apni phiraki ke jaadu se ab tak team ko harbhajan kii kami mahasoos nahin hone di he
 Jadeja's presence as an all-rounder balances the team and also gives Dhoni an extra bowler
 bharat ke liye haalanki sabase santosh kii baat uske ballebaajon kaa pradarshan he
 Except for openers Parthiv Patel and Ajinkya Rahane, all his batsmen scored runs in the first two matches
 hyderabad main captain dhoni kii aakraamak pari ne jahaan team ko jeet dilaai to dilli main yuva viraat kohli or gautam gambhir chaaye rahe
 Chasing England's target of 237, Kohli scored 112 not out, while Gambhir smashed an unbeaten 84 to help India reach 36
 4 over main hi lakshya hasil kar liya
 The only concern for India is the performance of openers Parthiv and Rahane but Dhoni is unlikely to tamper with the winning combination
 duusari taraf england kii team par upmahadweep kii paristhatiyon main acha pradarshan nahin kar paane kaa kaaphi dabaav hoga jahaan gend nichi rahati he
 Thursday is a do or die match for the visiting team as the team will lose the series with a loss in another match
 team ab tak khel ke har vibhaag main naakaam rahi he
 The team, which had recently been denied a win by Dhoni's team on India's tour of England, has also failed to bat for 50 overs in the first two games of the current series
 team ke paas captain elistare cook, craig keesweater, jonathan traat, kevin petersan or ravi bopaara ke rup main umdaa ballebaaj hai lekin ye ikai ke rup main pradarshan karne main naakaam rahe hai
 England have not given Ian Bell a chance in the first two matches which is a surprise decision and this batsman is almost certain to play in the third match
 shrinkhalaa main ab tak england kii gendbaaji bhi saadhaaran rahi he
 Steven Finn, Jade Dernbach and Tim Bresnan have failed to trouble the Indian batsmen, which obviously means the team is missing their experienced bowlers James Anderson and Stuart Broad in Indian conditions
 greem swaan or samit patel kii england kii spin jodi bhi paristhitiyon kaa phayda uthaane main vifal rahe hai jinke khilaaf bhartiya ballebaajon ne pehle do maichon main khub ran batore
 In the evening, dew can play an important role and in such a situation the team that wins the toss will decide to bowl first and take advantage of the help provided by the Mohali wicket in the beginning
 timen is prakaar hai:bharat:mahendra singh dhoni (captain), gautam gambhir, parthiv patel, ajinkya rahane, viraat kohli, suresh raina, ravindra jadeja, aar aswin, varuna aaron, umesh yadav, aar vinay kumaar, shrinath arvind, rahul sharma, manoj tiwari or praveen kumaar
 England: Alastair Cook (captain), Craig Keyswetter, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Ravi Bopara, Jonathan Bairstow, Graeme Swann, Samit Patel, Tim Bresnan, Steven Finn, Stuart Meeker, Scott Borthwick, Jose Butler and Alex Hales

 It is often said that killers choose their parents very carefully, but in this case, boys are not far behind girls
 apane liye partner kaa chayan karne se pehle ladke, ladakiyon kii bahut si chizon par dhyaan dete hai
 Let's know which things of girls affect boys the most
 1
 It is generally said that in the first meeting, your smile leaves a mark on the front more than your words
 aap apni muskuraahat se kisi ke bhi dil main jagah bana sakate hai
 Boys are moved by this gentle smile of girls
 2
 Nowadays, most of the girls like girls who are full of confidence
 jinhen yah pataa ho ki kis samay kaisaa bartaav karnaa he
 Boys feel more attraction towards such women
 3
 Boys may or may not speak to themselves, but in reality they are very much influenced by girls' stressing style
 ladako ko zyaadaatar aisi ladkiya pasand aati hai, jo duusari ladakiyon ko copy karne ke bajaae khud ke natural style main rahati hai
 Be it makeup, clothes or footwear
 4
 The eyes are called the mirror of a person's personality
 ladako ko aakarshith karne ke liye ladakiyon kii khubasurat ankhen hi kaaphi hoti hai
 Boys mostly like girls with big eyes
 5
 No matter how the boys are themselves, but they take care of everything from girls' makeup to their perfumes
 ladakon ko ladakiyon ke parafum kikhushboobahut prabhavit karti he
 Even if they forget the girl, forget what they said but, they never forget the fragrance of their perfume
 6
 Most boys like sensible and settled girls
 ab yah aap par nirbhar karata he aap kis tarah apni samajhadaari kaa pradarshan karti hai

 Angered by this, Anurag Kashyap told an interview in a newspaper, 'when the news came that it would be released on Christmas, i asked Rajkumar Hirani
 magar unhone inkaar kiya
 But now he is releasing the film on the same day my film Bombay Velvet is to be released '
 anuraag kashyap ne kaha ki sirf ek phone kol se in halaat se bachaa ja saktaa tha
 According to Anurag, if both these films were released on the same date, the business of both would be affected
 haalanki abhi bhi donon filmon kii relies date main sirf haftebhar kaa antar he

 america ne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan (dablutio) se kaha he ki vah uske is tark ko manyata de ki america poltry utpaadon ke aayaat par bhartiya pratibandh dablutio ke prati uske dayitvon kaa ulanghan he
 US Trade Representative Ron Kirk said on Friday that the US had made this formal request to the WTO to set up a dispute settlement committee when negotiations with India on April 16–17 failed to address US concerns
 yadhyapi bharat daawa karata he ki usne ye kadam avian influenza ko rokane ke lihaaj se uthaae hai, lekin kirk kaa kahana he ki bhartiya niyam maujuuda vigyaan, antarrashtriya dishanirdeshon or khud bharat dwaara apane gharelu udyog ke liye sthapit kiye gaye maanakon ke pratikul he
 Kirk said, "it is important that American farmers have access to reliable market access that India has agreed to
" 'kirk ne kaha, 'america apane krishi udyog main suraksha ke sarvocch maanak rakhata he, or use bharosa he ki dablutio isse sahamat hoga ki america aayaat par bhartiya pratibandh galat hai
 'india says it has full authority to ban imports from countries where there will be reports of an outbreak of less pathogenic avian influenza
 america main 2004 se abtak ek maatr yahi avian influenza paaya gaya he
 Kirk said, "india appears to have taken action against the Application of Sanity and Phytosanitary (SPS) Majors against its obligations under the WTO agreement
" uske kadam antarrashtriya dishanirdeshon yaa kisi vaidhanik jokhim akalan par aadhaarit nahin he
 It has also failed to ensure that its steps are not unreasonably discriminatory against imports from countries like the US

 Senior party leader from Andhra Pradesh k Keshav Rao said, "jaganmohan probably wants the party to take any action against him so that he can become a hero

 Odisha's world-famous Puri Jagannath temple has once again been mired in controversy
 raashtrapati ramnath kovind or unki patni savita ke saath mandir kii yatra ke dauraan vahaan ke sahaayakon ne durvyavhaar kiya tha
 Now Rashtrapati Bhavan has expressed deep disappointment over this incident
 yah chaunkaane vaala maamla us samay saamne aayaa jab shrijagannatha mandirprashasan (esagitie) ne durvyavhaar ke liye apane 3 aaropee sahaayakon ko kaaran bataao notice jari karne kaa faisla liya he
 President Kovind, along with his wife Savita, had gone for darshan in this prestigious temple on 18 March
 kovind danpati kimandir yatrako lekar vahaan par baari suraksha vyavastha tainaat kii gai thi, lekin unke mandir darshan ke dauraan kuch sahaayak suraksha protocol ko todate hue unke kareeb pahunch gaye or unhone is viipi danpati ke saath na sirf dhakka-mukki kii balki kohni se unhen takkar bhi maari
 However, the chief administrator of the temple, IAS Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra, refused to divulge anything about the incident
 mana ja rahaa he ki mandir or jila prashasan ne is ghatana ko gambhirtha se liya, philhal aropiyon ko notice jari karne kaa faisla liya gaya he
 Speaking to the Times of India, IAS Mohapatra said, 'we have received a letter from Rashtrapati Bhavan
 hamane mandir kii managing kamity se is sambandh baatcheet bhi kii he
 We are watching the entire matter
 'mandir se jude sutron kaa kahana he ki kuch sahaayakon ne kovind danpati ke raste ko us samay roak diya tha jab ve mandir main puja karne ja rahe the
 On the other hand, officials associated with the temple said that there was a small incident regarding the protocol of the President
 unki mandir yatra ke dauraan kuch sahaayakon or sarkari afasaron ko hi mandir ke andar jane diya gaya
 While the doors were closed to the common people
 is dauraan kuch sahaayak unase milane ko lekar aatur the or unase baat karnaa chaahate the, isliye ve raashtrapati ke kareeb chale gaye
 Earlier in April, there was a case of losing the temple key
 is maamle par vahaan kii raajnneeti bhi garma gai he
 The matter has reached the High Court

 ' Disappointed with Virat Kohli's failure to turn his century into a big century, the young batsman's coach Rajkumar Sharma hoped that his beloved disciple would succeed in making 'daddy Hundred' in the current series against Australia
 kohli ne australia ke khilaaf chennai main 107 ran kii pari kheli, lekin yah chauthaa avasar he, jabaki vah shatak jamaane ke baad zyada der tak krij par nahin tik paae
 Kohli, after completing the century, was caught by off-spinner Nathan Lyon in the air at mid-on
 isse pehle ke teen avasaron par unhone 116, 103 or 103 ran banaae the
 Coach Rajkumar Sharma said, i am not happy with the way he was out
 hamane shuru main hi leone par haaavee hone kii ranneeti apanaai thi, kyonki vah australia ke akraman kii kamjor kadi he, lekin uske shot kaa chayan sahi nahin tha
 England's batting coach Graham Gooch once asked his cricketers to make 'daddy Hundred' or big century and Rajkumar Sharma is also teaching this lesson to Kohli
 unhone kaha, vah lambii pari khilne kaa shaukeen he or vah bhi chahta he ki vah bada shatak lagaae
 i will talk to him about this now
 mujhe khushi he ki vah shrunkhlaa ke pehle match main shatak lagane main safal rahaa
 This will boost his confidence
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki agle maichon main aapako uske balle se 'daddy handred' dekhne ko milegaa
 Kohli did not perform as expected in the one-day matches against England and Pakistan and hence he made special preparations for the Australian series
 tippaniyan Sharma said, Kohli had continued preparations at his academy (west Delhi Cricket Academy)
 academy keval teen din hi khuli rahati he, lekin maine kohli ke liye baaki teen din bhi gendbaaj bulawaae or uski ballebaaji par baariki se najar rakhi
 He worked hard and landed in this series
 unhone kaha, vah kal ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad hi shatak jamaane ke prati aashwast tha
 i talked to him
 maine usase kaha tha ki australian nai ranneeti ke saath utrenge or uske liye jaal bichhaayenge or thik vaisaa hi hua
 Sharma said, i told him that the forward short leg and short midwicket will be fielded
 ham unki is yojana ke liye pehle se hi taiyaar the
 To be honest, what i was thinking happened
 yadi vah galat shot nahin kheltaa, to badi pari khel saktaa tha
 Kohli scored a 107-run knock against Australia in Chennai, but this is the fourth occasion, while he could not stay at the crease for long after scoring a century
 kohli ne shatak puraa karne ke baad of spinner nathan leone kii gend hawa main khelkar mid on par kaich thama diya tha
 On three previous occasions, he had scored 116, 103 and 103 runs
 coach rajkumaar sharma ne kaha, main uske out hone ke tareeke se khush nahin hum
 We initially adopted the strategy of dominating Leon, as he is a weak link to the Australian invasion, but his shot selection was not right
 england ke ballebaaji coach graham gooch ne ek baar apane cricketron ko 'daddy handred' yani bada shatak banane ke liye kaha tha or rajkumaar sharma bhi kohli ko yahi paath padhaa rahe hai
 He said, he is fond of playing long innings and he also wants to score a big century
 main ab usase is bare main baat karuunga
 i am happy that he was successful in scoring a century in the first match of the series
 isse uskaa aatmavishvaas badhegaa
 i am confident that in the next matches you will see 'daddy Hundred' with his bat
 kohli england or pakistan ke khilaaf ek-divasiy maichon main apekshit pradarshan nahin kar paae the or isliye australian shrunkhlaa ke liye unhone vishesh taiyaari kii thi
 The comments sharma ne kaha, kohli ne apni academy (west dilli cricket academy) main lagaataar taiyaari kii thi
 The academy remains open for only three days, but i called the bowler for the remaining three days for Kohli and kept a close watch on his batting
 vah kaaphi mehnat karke is shrunkhlaa main utraa tha
 He said, he was confident of scoring a century only after completing his half-century yesterday
 meri usase baat hui thi
 i told him that the Australians would come up with a new strategy and lay a trap for that and that's exactly what happened
 sharma ne kaha, maine usase kah diya ki forward short leg or short midwicket par kshetrarakshak lagaaya jayega
 We were already prepared for his plan
 eemaandaaree se kahuun to, jo main soch rahaa tha vaisaa hi hua
 If he did not play the wrong shot, he could play a big innings
 coach rajkumaar sharma ne kaha, main uske out hone ke tareeke se khush nahin hum

 Alastair Cook broke Hammond's record of scoring the most century for England and Sachin Tendulkar at the youngest to complete 7000 runs during his century against India
 cook ne apana 23waan shatak jadaa or is tarah se england kii taraf se test cricket main sarvaadhik shatak jadne vaale ballebaaj bane
 He broke Hammond's 73-year-old record
 vaise, hamend ke alaava colin coudre, jeophri bykaat or kevin petersan ke naam par bhi 22
 22 centuries are recorded
 cook ne tisare test match ke duusare din chaay ke vishram ke baad of spinner aar aswin kii gend par pedal sweep se teen ran lekar apana shatak puraa kiya
 This is his third and 23rd total of the series, which is a new record for England
 ab tak yah record hamend, coudre, bykaat, cook or petersan ke naam par tha
 Of these, Hammond first set a record in August 1939 for his country's hundreds of hundreds
 tab se yah record unheen ke naam par darj tha
 He was later equaled by other players, but Cook was the first batsman to break his record
 apana 86waan match khel rahe cook ne apni is pari ke dauraan 88waan ran banaate hi test cricket main 7000 ran bhi puure kiye
 Cook is now only 27 years 347 days old and thus he broke the record of Tendulkar at the youngest to complete 7000 runs
 test cricket main sarvaadhik ran banane vaale tendulkar jab is mukaam par pahunche the tab unki umr 28 saal 193 din thi
 He is the tenth English batsman to reach this milestone
 unase pehle england kii taraf se graham gooch, alek stewart, david gavar, bykaat, mike ethraton, colin coudre, petersan, hamend or andrew strans yah uplabdhi hasil kar chuke hai
 Cook, a left-handed batsman, scored a century in his fifth consecutive Test match as captain
 yah karnama karne vaale vah duniya ke pehle ballebaaj hai
 India's Sunil Gavaskar had scored a century in his first four matches as captain, but he could not score a century in a match in the middle while he scored two centuries in a match
 is tarah se captain ke rup main pehle chaar match main chaar shatak lagane kaa record ab tak cook or gavaskar ke naam par tha
 This is Cook's third consecutive century in the series
 is tarah se vah averton viks, gairi sobers, ken bairington or apane vartmaan coach endi flower kii shrenee main shaamil ho gaye hai, jinhone bharat main lagaataar teen match main shatak jamaaye
 By the way, only Ken Berrington has scored a century in four consecutive matches for England, and that too twice
 pehali baar unhone varsh 1961 main lahore main pakistan ke khilaaf shatak thoka, or uske baad lagaataar teen test maichon main bharat ke khilaaf kramshah mumbai, kanpur or dilli main shatak lagaae
 Berrington did the same feat for the second time in 1967–68, when he hit a century against Pakistan at the Lords, Nottingham and Oval grounds, and also scored a century against the West Indies in their first match at Port of Spain in 1968
 iske alaava sar jaik hobbs, or woli hamend ne bhi lagaataar teen shatak thokane kaa karnama do-do baar kiya he
 It is noteworthy that Hobbs did this feat both times against Australia
 pehali baar varsh 1911-12 main or phir varsh 1924-25 main unhone lagaataar teen maichon main teen shatak lagaae
 Hammond scored three centuries in three consecutive Test matches against Australia in 1928–29 for the first time, and the second time in 1933 against Australia and New Zealand
 tippaniyan The interesting fact is that the English batsmen who once performed this feat also include Ken Berrington, who scored three centuries in three consecutive Tests against Australia and New Zealand in 1963
 ek baar yah karnama karne vaale anya english ballebaajon kii suchi main harbart satakliff, denis compton, jeffri boycott, ellen lamb, kris broad, graham gooch, ian bel, andrew strans, or ravi bopaara shaamil hai
 Well, the record for hitting a century in the most consecutive matches is in the name of Sir Don Bradman of Australia, who scored centuries in six consecutive matches against England in the year 1937-38
 don breadman ne iske alaava lagaataar chaar maichon main shatak thokane kaa karnama bhi do baar kiya
 On the other hand, the players who have done this feat in five consecutive matches include Jack Kallis of South Africa, Mohammad Yousuf of Pakistan and Gautam Gambhir of India
 lagaataar chaar test maichon main shatak lagane vaale khilaadiyon main bhi bharat kii ore se sunil gavaskar, rahul dravid, or sachin tendulkar shaamil hai, jabaki lagaataar teen maichon main shatak lagane waalon kii suchi main bharat kii ore se vijay hajaare, poli umarigar, sunil gavaskar, virendra sahvaag, or mohammad azahruddin kaa naam darj he, jinamein se azahruddin ne yah karnama do baar kiya
 By the way, in addition to Hammond, 22 named after Colin Cowdrey, Geoffrey Boycott and Kevin Peterson
 22 shatak darj hai
 Cook completed his century with a paddle sweep off off-spinner r Ashwin after a tea break on the second day of the third Test
 yah unka is shrunkhlaa kaa teesraa or kul 23waan shatak he jo england ke liye nayaa record he
 The record so far was named after Hammond, Cowdrey, Boycott, Cook and Peterson
 inamen se hamend ne sabase pehle agast 1939 main apane desh kii taraf se sarvaadhik saikade jadne kaa record banaaya tha
 Since then this record was recorded in his name
 baad main anya khilaadiyon ne unki barabari kii, lekin cook pehle ballebaaj rahe, jinhone unka record todaa
 Cook, playing his 86th match, also completed 7000 runs in Test cricket as he scored 88th run during his innings
 cook abhi keval 27 saal 347 din ke hai or is tarah se unhone sabase kam umr main 7000 ran puure karne kaa tendulkar kaa record tod diya
 Tendulkar, who scored the most runs in Test cricket, reached 28 when he was 28 years old, 193 days old
 vah is mukaam par pahunchane vaale dasven english ballebaaj hai
 Prior to that, England have achieved this feat by Graham Gooch, Alec Stewart, David Gaver, Boycott, Mike Atherton, Coleen Cowdrey, Peterson, Hammond and Andrew Strauss
 baayen haath ke ballebaaj cook ne captain ke taur par lagaataar paanchaven test match main shatak jamaaya
 He is the first batsman in the world to do this feat
 bharat ke sunil gavaskar ne captain ke rup main apane pehle chaar match main shatak lagaae the, lekin vah bich main ek match main shatak nahin bana paye the jabaki ek match main unhone do shatak jade the
 Thus, the record of scoring four centuries in the first four matches as captain was still in the name of Cook and Gavaskar
 cook kaa yah shrunkhlaa main lagaataar teesraa shatak he
 In this way he joins the ranks of Everton Vicks, Gary Sobers, Ken Barrington and his current coach Andy Flower, who have scored centuries in three consecutive matches in India
 vaise, england kii ore se isse pehle sirf ken berington ne lagaataar chaar maichon main shatak thokane kaa karnama kiya he, or vah bhi do-do baar
 He first scored a century against Pakistan in Lahore in 1961, and then scored centuries against India in Mumbai, Kanpur and Delhi respectively in three consecutive Test matches
 berington ne duusari baar yahi karnama varsh 1967-68 main kiya, jab lords, nottingham or ovel ke maidaanon main unhone pakistan ke khilaaf shatak lagaae, or 1968 main port of spain main khele apane pehle match main west indies ke khilaaf bhi shatak thoka
 Apart from this, Sir Jack Hobbs, and Volley Hammond have also done twice to hit three consecutive centuries
 ullekhneey he ki hobbs ne donon baar yah karnama australia ke khilaaf kiya
 He scored three centuries in three consecutive matches, first in the year 1911–12 and then in 1924–25
 hamend ne pehali baar varsh 1928-29 main australia ke khilaaf, or duusari baar varsh 1933 main australia or newzealand ke khilaaf lagaataar teen test maichon main teen-teen shatak lagaae
 The comments dilachasp tathy yah he ki ek baar yah kartab kar dikhaane vaale england ke ballebaajon main bhi ken berington shaamil hai, jinhone varsh 1963 main australia or newzealand ke khilaaf lagaataar teen test maichon main teen shatak thoke
 The list of other English batsmen who once did this includes Herbert Sutcliffe, Dennis Compton, Jeffrey Boycott, Ellen Lamb, Chris Broad, Graham Gooch, Ian Bell, Andrew Strauss, and Ravi Bopara
 vaise sabase zyaada lagaataar maichon main shatak thokane kaa record australia ke sar don breadman ke naam he, jinhone varsh 1937-38 main england ke khilaaf lagaataar chah maichon main shatak lagaae the
 Apart from this, Don Bradman has also done twice to score a century in four consecutive matches
 udhar, lagaataar paanch maichon main yah karnama karne vaale khilaadiyon main dakshin africa ke jaik kalis, pakistan ke mohammad yusuf or bharat ke gautam gambhir shaamil hai

 kuch saal pehle kii baat he
 One of my uncles from Canada fell into an open manhole in South Delhi
 ve raat ke khaane ke baad tahalne ke liye nikle the par 11 ghante baad laute
 Hearing their screams, a person passing by saved them
 baad main unhone kaha, agar yah sab toronto main hua hota to shahar ke adhikariyon par lakhon dollar kaa mukadmaa thok detaa
 He was lucky to have suffered minor injuries and survived
 ganimat rahi ki unke upar koi or nahin gira
 The next day's newspaper referred to three separate accidents involving a manhole
 yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki bharat ke shahar aisi visphotak sthiti main hai jahaan kabhi bhi, kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 The collapse of buildings in Mumbai, the floods on the streets of Kolkata, the waste of garbage in Delhi, all of these later lead to accidents
 ye haadase itane niyamit hote hai ki inke hone par kisi ko hairat nahin hoti
 The entire legislation of local bodies regarding an accident is limited to dealing with the after effects and waiting for it to happen again
 haal main texas main baadh se jitne logon kii mrityu hui, usase zyada log to mumbai main ek imaarat ke dhahne se mar gaye
 There are many buildings in Mumbai that are more than a hundred years old
 ek aisa shahar, jahaan sir par chat hona hi badi baat he, chaahe vah kitni bhi asthaayee or khatarnaak kyon na ho, in halaat ko badalane kii chintaa na to naagarik prashasan ko he or na hi khatarnaak imaaraton main rah rahe logon ko
 In such a situation, it is not surprising that the attention of people towards a mountain as high as 18 floors of garbage in Delhi does not go until it collapses
 ve kuch ajeeb kism ke hi afasarshah honge jo 15 saal pehle hi apni puri kshamta tak bhar chuke landphil ke prati udasin bane rahe
 It was only after the death of a schoolgirl from an open manhole in North Delhi last year that the authorities felt the need to cover her
 na to nigam or na hi us gali main rahane vaale logon ko laga ki ve kisi bhi tarah us ladki kii maut ke liye jimmedaar the
 If that girl had survived with minor injuries, she might not have even bothered to cover the manhole
 is beraham asamvedansheeltaa kaa kaaran hamaare dilo-dimag main ghar kar gai yah baat he ki aam logon ke jivan kaa shaayad hi koi mol he
 Such negligence is everywhere
 shimla or almoda ke bich chaar len vaale rajmarg ke nirmaan main paharipoon ko katkar lambii-lambii pattiyaan nikaali gai hai

 himachal main doordaraj ke shaharon main chah se aath manzil vaale hotel banaae ja rahe hai, khatarnaak pahari dhalaan par apartment banaakar inhen pahaado main duusare ghar ke rup main bechaa ja rahaa he
 Similarly, cardamom and tea gardens in Ooty and Coonoor near Bangalore are being developed as holiday homes for the rich
 jaise hi aap shimla, solan, darjeeling yaa gangtok main ghusenge, aapkaa saamana maanviya jyaadati kii dastaan bayaan karte betaratib or ek-duusare se satee imaaraton ke jaal se hoga

 Chennai floods last year, Mumbai floods this year and Kashmir floods a few years ago, Kedarnath flood
 ye sabhi sanket karte hai ki sarkaar ko sthaneey paristhitiki or iske sangrakshan ke anukool basaavat ke bare main sochna hi hoga
 Construction cannot be allowed merely in view of demand or tourism policy
 desh main har taraf aadha-adhuraa or betaratib-sa najaara he
 The land of assay is constantly being created in the Indian scenario, which is awaiting balance and prudence

 The tragic consequences of development must be dealt with vigorously with a wave of hands
