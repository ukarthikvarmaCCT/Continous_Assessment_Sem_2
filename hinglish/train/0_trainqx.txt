 ' devendra satyaarthee lok sahitya ke darvesh hai, jinhone dashakon pehle lokgeeton kii khoj main is mahadesh kaa chappa-chappa chaan maaraa tha
 In folklore, he would hear the real pain and sounds of the earth
 saath hi bhartiya janata kaa sachcha ras-ullas, anand-utsav, reeti-rivaaj, lok paramparaayen, raag-viraag or sukh-dukh kii ve ankahi baaten bhi, jo hajaaron hridayon main ghumadati thim or phir chupake-chupake kisi janapad yaa gramachal ke lokgeeton main dhalakar hawa main goonj uthati thim
 To say these were the songs of the simple illiterate people of the village, but they were also the bearers of the great culture of this country and thousands of years old folk traditions, from which the mind and soul of the best people of this country could be interviewed
 
 alag-alag boliyaan or bhashaa bolne vaale janapad or gramaachalon ke ye loakgeet milakar ek aisa saajha pul banaate the, jise samajhe bina is mahaan desh kii hajaaron baras puraani sabhyataa or samskruti ko samajhnaa asambhav tha
 Perhaps this was the reason that Gandhiji also considered this work of Loksadhek Devendra Satyarthi as a part of the freedom struggle and he used to read the articles of Satyarthi ji published in 'vishal Bharat' on the folklore of different villages of the country
 Were
 itnaa hi nahin, kaaka kalelkar ko vishesh rup se bhejkar unhone satyaarthee ji ko congress ke maha adhiveshan main bulaayaa or unka sammaan kiya
 Well-known thinker and philologist Dr
 sunitikumar chatarji to lokgeeton kii khoj main gaanv-gaanv, gali-gali bhatakate lokyatri devendra satyaarthee ke kaam or fakkad vyaktitv se is kadar prabhavit hue ki unhone bhavvibhor hokar kaha, "satyaarthee ji aadi se ant tak ek chintansheel or agragami samskruti-doot ke rup main sadaiv hamaari bhashaaon kii rangabhumi par khadey rahenge
 "in the same way, the scholar of ancient history and culture Vasudevarsharan Agrawal called him 'the true Chakravarti of the district of India'," whose chariot wheel with its high flag has come all over again, chanting the villager Bharatmata
 " main samajhataa hoon, isse achche alfaaz satyaarthee ji ke dhul-dhoosarit pairon ke nirantar safar kii kahani ko nahin die ja sakate
 Satyarthi ji, because of his unique and brilliant tune of folklore, without any institution or governmental help, the work he did on his own, is so big and classical that only because of it, Devendra Satyarthi is the biggest of modern India Prove to be 'culture-messengers'
 mahatma gandhi ne satyaarthee ji ke lok sahitya sambandhi is kaam kaa mahatva samajha tha or baar-baar chitthiyon main ve likhte hai ki alag-alag pradesh or bhashaa ke lokgeeton par likhe gaye "tumhaare lekh main khub ras le-lekar padhata hoon
 "this 'rasa' is also because when Satyarthi ji writes on the folk songs of a language, the simple impulse of those folk songs in his words itself explodes and in that impulse the happiness and sorrows and wishes of farmers, laborers, women
 a world of music, music of deep family juices and hummus crops is inhabited
 satyaarthee ji lokgeeton main samoochee janata kaa dukh-dard or dharti kii aakul pukaar sunate hai or usee ko apane sidhe-sade mamatvabhre shabdon main kah daalate hai
 That is why there is a thing in his folk literature articles, which prepares even Mahatma Gandhi to read it in spite of all his political engagements
 shaayad isiilie mahatma gandhi ko satyaarthee ji kaa kaam desh kii aazaadee kii ladaai kaa ek jaruri hissaa hi lagata tha
 He repeatedly insists that Satyarthi ji is wandering from village to village, searching for the soul of India through the collection of folk songs, that is the basic motivation of the freedom struggle
 ham bharat kii jis vishaal janata ke dukh-dard kii baat karte hai, uski samoochee abhivyakti to alag-alag bhashaaon ke lokgeeton main hi hoti he
 That is why when the Faizpur session of the Congress was held, Gandhiji specially sent Kaka Kalelkar, and invited Satyarthi to participate in this plenary
 vahaan gandhi ji or bahut-se anya pratinidhiyon ne satyaarthee ji ke kaam kii khulkar prashansa kii
 Satyarthi ji recites this folklore on the pain of the people crying out in the British Raj, "rabb Moya, Devate Bhajj Gaya, Raj Firangiyan da
 
 
 !" to is par gandhi ji kii tippanee gauratlab he
 He is as if thrilled with emotion and says, "if i and Jawaharlal's speeches are put on one side of the scales, and this folk song alone on the other, then the folk ball will be heavy
" "satyaarthee ji kii yahi anokhi dhun jab anwarat yatraaon se hote hue unhen shantiniketan le jaati he, to rabindranath thakur unhen dekhakar swaagat-bhav se kehete hai, "mujhe khushi he, jo kaam main nahin kar paaya, use aap puraa kar rahe hai
 "and then this dabble, dhuni yayawar finds out, Rabindranath Thakur himself, in his teens, had planned to travel all over Bengal by sitting on a bullock cart, so that he would go from village to village to the folklore whom he called 'palli Geet' in Bengali
 Are, to be assembled
 gurudev rabindranath thakur kii yah yojana puri na ho saki, isiilie satyaarthee ji main unhen apni adhuri yatraaon ke puure hone kaa sapana saakaar hota dikhaai dene lagata he
 As if in a diary, he writes in his diary, "nomads of the whole world, leave my smell in my words!" Used to narrate
 hua yah ki satyaarthee ji ghoomte-ghoomte dehradun pahunche to maaloom padaa, yahan malviya ji bhi aakar tehre hue hai
 Satyarthi had met Malaviya ji and Mahamana was familiar with the work and yearning of his collection of folk songs, he was also an admirer
 satyaarthee ji jab unase milane gaye to malviya ji bahut khush hokar prem se mili, unke kaamon or lekhan ke bare main poocha
 Satyarthi was just telling everyone that suddenly Mahamana's eyes fell on his dusty feet
 unhone kaha, "aap ek minute rukiye
 "mahamana went in and returned, he had a pair of socks in his hand
 unhone satyaarthee ji se pair dho lene ke liye kaha or uske baad apane haath se mojey pehanaane lage
 Satyarthi ji was very hesitant
 pair peeche hataate hue bole, "are-are, malviya ji, yah aap kya karte hai, main to aapke bete ke baraabar hoon
 "on this, Mahamana Malaviya ji's answer was," Can a father not stock his son? Don't know where these feet have wandered
 aaj apane haath se tumhen mojey pahanaauunga, to mujhe sukh milegaa
 "later, sensing Satyarthi's reluctance, he asked his son to wear socks to him
 satyaarthee ji jab bhi yah prasang sunaate the, unka swar bhig jaataa tha
 As if the eyes were hoarse and they used to say softly, "at that time it had taken such a huge task in hand, because the blessings of so many elders were with me
 yah sab na hota to kya main apana kaam puraa kar paata? shaayad kahin bich raah main hi thakkar yaa tuutakar baith jaataa
 "it is a thrill today to think that this Dhoni man has traveled from village to village, every corner of India, without stopping, for twenty years, without stopping
 or sabhi bhashaaon ke lagbhag teen lakh loakgeet ikatthe kiye
 He was also in this condition when there was no support from anywhere
 kisi sanstha kaa koi anudaan yaa faillowship nahin or kabhi-kabhi to haalat yah hoti thi ki jeb main chaar paise tak nahin
 If someone raised the rent money, then they went ahead
 na kal ke bhojan kaa thikaana, na thaharne kaa
 And thus, such a big work in the field of folk songs or any folk art has never been done before, nor after
 devendra satyaarthee yahan akele hai, apni misaal khud
 Ramnaresh Tripathi, who himself did a great job in the field of folklore, remembers this unique tune of Satyarthi with great spontaneity, respect and sentiment in one letter, "the path i wish to follow in relation to the village songs i was doing it, you measured it
 aapkaa saahas dhanya he
 Your true passion has become the object of history
 main aapako pranaam karata hoon
 
 
 
 is kshetra main aap hi pehle or aap hi antim hai
 Who will work so hard! ”here is one thing to consider
 ramanaresh treepathi jise ‘gramgit’ kehete hai, satyaarthee uske liye shuru se ‘loakgeet’ shabd kaa prayog karte aae hai
 He had no objection to the word 'village', but rather he knew well that most of the folk songs originated from the village background
 lekin ‘lok’ kii parivyapti zyada he tathaa vah ek aisi chetana kii upaj he jo manushya or manushya main fark nahin karti, gramin or shahari main bhi nahin
 Perhaps that's why Satyarthi ji was more fascinated by the word 'folk song' and today the word 'folk song' is in vogue, not 'grammati'
 sachaai yah he ki ‘loakgeet’ hi nahin, ‘lokkatha’, ‘lok sahitya’, ‘lokkala’ or ‘lokyaan’ jaise shabdon ke hindi main prachlan kaa bada shrey satyaarthee ji ko hi jaataa he
 It is a matter of deep pride that he never made this claim proudly nor did he have any desire or idea to do so
 unhone hameshaa vinamrata se yahi kaha ki main aakhir janata se lee hui cheez hi to janata ko de rahaa hoon
 What is my own in this! Even before independence, All India Radio director Ahmed Shah Bukhari 'pitras' urged Satyarthi to give his assembled folk songs to All India Radio, who were voiced by the best singers of the time To be presented in satyaarthee ji ne alag-alag bhashaaon ke ek hajaar ek chuninda loakgeet ol india radio ko die
 But when it came to remuneration, Satyarthi immediately retaliated
 bole, "dekhie, inhen maine jagah-jagah ghumkar ikattha avashya kiya he, par ye gaanv waalon kii chijen hai
 They own capital
 in par to copirite ‘bharatmata’ kaa he!" or sachmuch un lokgeeton kaa paarishramik unhone nahin liya
 This does not only reveal the self-respect of Satyarthi ji, it also reveals the strong belief of his conscience that the first right on folk literature is of the people, that of the 'earth land'
 padhe-likhe buddhijivi, tathakthith samskruti chintak or vishvavidhyalayon ke professor inaki baarik-bariktar vyakhyaayein bhale hi kar len, par rahengi ye gaanv waalon kii chijen hi
 One such incident is of Satyarthi's visit to Lanka in 1940
 lanka jane se pehle ve chennai (tab madras) main kuch din ruke
 At the same time, the editor of a Tamil letter brought a check of five thousand rupees
 vinamr swar main kaha, "ham log lok sahitya par aapke lekh anudit karke chhapate rahete hai, yah uskaa paarishramik he
 "satyarthi smiled
 bole, "meri lanka-yatra ke kharch kaa intjaam ho gaya he
 So what will i do with this amount? Please give it to the translator
 "or sach hi yah raashi anuvadak ko de di gai
 That too when Satyarthi ji did not even have four in his pocket
 haan, ek bhadra purush ne unki lanka-yatra ke kharch kaa jimmaa le liya tha, or satyaarthee ji isi se santusht the
 Satyarthi was not simply said 'fakir king of folk songs'! The biggest feature of Satyarthi's study of folk literature is that when he writes articles on folklore, the pain and suffering of the vast masses of India in his language Shedding goes on
 jis bhashaa main bharat kaa garib majdoor yaa kisaan sochataa he, jo uske rone-gane, ullas or sapanom kii bhashaa he, vahi bhashaa khud-ba-khud satyaarthee ji kii kalam se utarane lagati he
 That is why when these articles of Satyarthi used to be published in a magazine of international fame like 'modern Review', Ramanand Chatterjee's order to the editorial department was also stating that, "A single translation of the folklore made by Satyarthi Words should not be moved from here to place, nor should they be changed
 isliye ki lokgeeton ke hriday ko satyaarthee ji or unke alfaaz hi sabase behatar dhang se khol sakate hai, koi or nahin
 "similarly, his article on Pashto folklore was published in the 'asia' magazine originating from New York
 dow
 Scholars such as Shyamacharan Dubey were very impressed with him and the dancers were writing letters repeatedly and pointing out the importance of their work
 yahan tak ki ve apni pustak ‘indian village’ kii bhoomika satyaarthee ji se likhavana chaahate the
 He made a lot of request, but Satyarthi ji's humbly refusal
 unka kahana tha ki main lok sahitya kaa academic vidwaan nahin
 So get this work done by someone else! What a great man! In his humility, he seems older than all academy scholars
 lekin auron kii tarah kabhi apane kaam or yogadan ko jataana use nahin aayaa
 * Prabhakar Machve, in one of his articles, wrote with great gratitude remembering Satyarthi's contribution to folk literature, how Devendra Satyarthi's work of folk literature took the form of a movement
 ‘lekhak gaanvon main jaaen’ kii prerana se bhartiya bhashaaon ke bahuterey lekhak lok sahitya ke adhyayan or sangrah ke liye gaanvon kii ore nikal pade
 Jhaberchand Meghani was engaged in this work in Gujarati, then in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Ramnaresh Tripathi showed the work of historical importance
 par gaur se dekhen to sab par satyaarthee ji ke kaam kaa prabhaav or chhap saaf dikhaai detii he
 Because once he got involved in this work, he did not look back and kept walking on dusty footpaths for years
 yon devendra satyaarthee kii lokgeeton kii talash ne unhen ‘itihaas purush’ bhale hi bana diya ho, par jab vah sab kuch chhodkar lok-yatra par nikle to khyaati kii baat gaun hi rahi
 Simply, folk songs used to look good
 bachapan se unka ras-swaad chakhaa tha, to unhen ikattha karne ke liye man lalak uthaa
 In the role of his first folklore-study 'dharti Gaati Hai', he writes very politely - "today i wonder how twenty years of this short life have been spent to fill my bag with Indian folk songs
 koi vishesh saadhan to tha nahin
 Facilities were never questioned
 phir bhi ek lagan avashya thi- ek dhun
 Even today, it is difficult to say whether the tune of seeing new places, meeting new people or more was really the tune of collecting folk songs
 jo bhi ho, maine nirantar lambii-lambii yatraayen kin
 In many districts, i went two or two, three times
 inhen yatraaon main maine shiksha kii kami ko bhi puraa kiya
 "the ease and self-respect with which Satyarthi reveals his shortcomings and does not keep any knots within, reveals the secret of his personality which made him obsessed with folk songs to such an extent
 yah tha jivan ko hriday kii aankh se dekhnaa or kavita ko karm main utaarna
 The same thing gave Devendra Satyarthi a language that along with his unique tune that not only the simple people, laborers, farmers and women of the village, but also his folklore, came in front of him and started to open his heart
 or yon satyaarthee ji or lokgeeton main kuch aisi ‘batakahi’ chal padati he, jise saadh paanaa vishvavidhyalayon ke bade-bade panditon or aacharyon ke bas kii to nahin hi he
 When Prabhakar Machwe said that "satyarthi alone has done more valuable work than hundreds of literature professors," he was referring to the same liquid sensation and humidity of Satyarthi, which has given him the language to give every folk song He brings his different ground and cultural identity to our eyes
 jaise is ‘lok yaayavar’ ke saamne ve loakgeet ‘sadeh’ ho gaye hai
 Here, the elasticity of the language and imagination of the language of Satyarthi ji is made by seeing
 ""chir-parichit shabd
 Familiar things
 chir-parichit swar-yahi loakgeet kii shakti he
 Some songs were as high as a mountain trail, some were images of the far-flung horizon of a flat state
 neerav, udhaas dopahari ke geeton kaa rang or hota he, raatri ke geeton kaa or
 Each season, every festival, spinning-weeding, plowing-sowing and weeding-harvesting social activities - are all stitched together
 makai kii roti jaisaa surya udai hota he, saanj ho aati he, raat biit jaati he or samay-chakra ke saath loakgeet ke pahie nirantar chalate rahete hai
 "for Devendra Satyarthi, collection of folklore was not a imposed duty
 bachapan se ve uske aakarshan se bandh chuke the
 He was tempted to listen to women and shepherds
 ek baar to gaanv ke charavaahon se loakgeet sun-sunakar unhone copy main utaara tha or badale main sandook se churaakar paise bhi die the
 Later this theft was caught and they were scolded
 yah daant to ve sah gaye, lekin apni pasand ke jin lokgeeton ko unhone copy par utaara, unke saath hua ‘haadasa’ unhen dahala gaya
 It happened that for fear of getting scolded, he had hidden that copy with his friend Asa Singh
 khud asasingh loakgeet bahut achche ga letaa tha or use bhi lokgeeton ko sunne-sunaane kaa nasha-sa tha
 But when Asa Singh failed in the middle, that copy of the songs fell prey to his father's wrath
 vah copy jala di gai, yah khabar balak satyaarthee ko mili to jaise uskaa khun suukh gaya ho
 No words came out of his mouth till late
 vah ise sah to gaya, lekin ek nae sankalp ke saath ki vah is kaam main apana jivan laga degaa or kuch nayaa karke dikhayega
 Will keep honoring folk songs
 yah vichaar ek kshan ke liye bhi unke man se lupt nahin hua
 Once in an intimate conversation he was told, "arya went to a celebration of Samaj in childhood
 vahiin pehle pahal ‘gitanjali’ dekhi, kharidkar ghar le aayaa
 Know why the mind was questioning intermittently, 'gitanjali' can get Nobel Prize, so why not our folk songs
 kya ye kisi se hethe hai?"dhire-dhire lokgeeton kii duniya main or adhik rame to satyaarthee ji ko samaj main aane laga, yah to sachmuch apni jadon kii ore lautnaa he
 The subtle identity of India's cultural unity is hidden in these folk songs
 inhen samajhe bagaiyr bharat or bharat kii janata ko samajhnaa naammumkin he
 The folklore collected by Satyarthi himself says the same thing in totality
 bundeli lokgeeton main aankhon main kaajal daale sindur se maang bhare, hariyaale vastra pahanakar khadi dharti maan kaa vishwamohini rup he, to gadhwali geeton main apane malath gaanv ke liye kuch aisa prem umad aata he ki shabd-shabd bolne lagata he-kaisaa he o bhandari, tera malath?dekhne main bhala lagata he sahabo, meraa malath
 
 
 Satyarthi ji has translated this folklore in such an easy language that sometimes there is confusion that it is not a contemporary poem
 *satyaarthee ji ke bhandar main itane rang-roopon ke, sundar or prabhavi loakgeet samaae hue hai ki dekhakar achraj hota he
 On the one hand, they are attracted by the songs of the seafarers whose paddle sing the songs of Azad waves, on the other hand in the charkha-songs, they gave a new comment to the freedom of women
 phir vidroh or swadhinata sangram ke geet to hai hi
 But these songs have the most speed and freedom in the song of the sailors - throughout the day i run the boat on the other birds, o Iravati! The life of the sailors is a song in itself, o Iravati! Further depicting the beauty of the daughters of Iravati
 , Which fills exuberance and joy in life and makes particles cry - beautiful virgins are dancing, swinging, fast, sometimes slowly
 tumne yah naach kahan siikhaa?bataao, bataao, iravati kii betio!ham hai mor or tum ho moraniyaan,mor maare jaayenge or tum royaa karogi
 Learned this dance at this turn of the river, or where the Iravati originates from that mountain? Where did you learn this dance? Tell, tell, the daughters of Iravati! par iske baavjood in mallahon ke garibi ke ansu or darun pidaa kahan chhip paati he-iravati main hamaare ansu samaate rahe hai, bhaaiyo!iravati kitni maili ho rahi he
 And while poverty will strangle us, Iravati will continue to flow like this
 yahi baat un charkha-geeton ko lekar kahin ja sakati he jinhone kuch niraale devdooton kii tarah gandhi ji kii swarajya kii bhaavana ko jan-jan tak pahunchaa diya
 In the 'bharatmata' essay, Satyarthi examines the folk culture closely associated with these charkha-songs
 in charkha-geeton main bhartiya stri kaa jo apaar aatmavishvaas, aatmanirbharta or swabhimaan chipa he, uski ore ve baar-baar ingit karte hai
 After all, on the strength of this charkha, a self-respecting woman from Andhra Pradesh is able to say to her friend - husband kahe o nisichchmuch husband kahe? The charkha is right and safe, i will pull Golconda here
 pati kaahe ko o nari,sachmuch pati kaahe ho!charakhe kii isi aatmanirbharta ke kaaran punjabi or rajasthani lokgeeton main sthaan-sthaan par charakhe kaa jo abhinandan hua he, satyaarthee ji ek janakranti maanakar use naman karte hai
 They also enjoy the juice of 'trinjan' songs sung with charkha in Punjab
 pardesh jate pati ko jo baat ek stri kahati he, vah ek sundar geet main satyaarthee ji ke nikat aati he to ve bhavvibhor ho uthte hai
 That is a unique song - Ik taka teri chakrichakari ve mahiya, lakh takke da mera suet vekhiyan nun nahi nahi naaye kya nahi? is
 bagaiyr aarthik swatantraaa ke har swatantraaa adhuri he
 And Charkha not only gave women financial freedom, but also gave them full confidence and self-respect! Gandhi ji was such a wonder, which was not understood properly
 par lokgeeton main yah bhaavana ai or khub ai
 Even more emotional is another folklore discovered by Satyarthi ji of the Orissa's Kond tribals, where women and men spin yarn is no less than kings and queens - the queen is spinning yarn and the king is weaving clothes by wearing beautiful clothes
 or is puure loakgeet main ‘o rani
 
 
 o queen, o king
 
 
 o raja’ kii pukaar maano aam janata ke maathe par tilak karke use raja-rani ke sone ke singhaasana par bithla detii he
 This is the victory of democracy, in which every hard working man is a king and every hard working woman is a queen! Not only this, Satyarthi ji has also discovered many songs which have deep pain in slavery and anger towards the atrocities of the British government
 And also trouble
 aise geet bhi kam nahin the jinamein gandhi, nehru, netaji subhaashachandr bose or sardaar patel mahanayakon kii tarah the or angrejon kii gulaami se dukhi or aart janata ummid kar rahi thi ki ve jaldi hi apni chamatkaari shaktiyon se gulaami ke kaale andhkaar ko faad denge
 But there was a deeper and more true feeling towards Bhagat Singh, who was the head of the revolutionaries and the British also used to terrorize him somewhere
 balki ek geet to aisa bhi he jisamen bhagatsingh ko phaansi dene kii angrejon kii himmat nahin pad rahi or antim vakt main bhagatsingh ke bheetar se deshbhakti kii bhaawanaaon kaa jowar foot padaa he-dusht muen, more pal-pal hote anvaarakyon daro daar gale phaansi?sudha sura swarg ko jaundharam raay ko bitha sunaaun,or har se maang bhagatsingh ko laaounbharat ko hajaar,kyon daro daar gale phaansi?arthath, o muay dusht! mujhe to pal-pal der ho rahi he
 Why i am afraid now by hanging my neck? i am brave, i will go straight to heaven and tell Dharamraj all the saga
 main bhagwaan se ek hajaar bhagatsingh mangekar laut aauunga
 Why are you scared by hanging my neck now? When i am born again, i will see you present here
 
 
 
 Oh wary! Then i will hang you in the queue of enemies
 mere gale main phaansi daalkar ab darataa kyon he? meri laash jalegi, main yaheen bhasma ban jaaounga
 Then plants will grow on this earth
 meri haddiyaan or meraa rakt sab hi fal denge
 Oh wary! India is our country
 mere gale main phaansi daalkar ab darataa kyon he? tumne bahuton par atyaachaar kiya he
 Oh wicked! Now you have come down to wickedness
 ab landan par honi kaa prahaar hua chahta he, lanka kii tarah
 Why i am afraid now by hanging my throat? In the same way, the wonderful folk songs of 1857 were written on the valor of the rebels
 kai geeton main vir kunwarasingh or rani lakshmibai kii veerta kaa romaanchakaari bakhaan he
 In one such song, there is a wonderful description of the valor of King Benimadhavbakhsh Singh
 angrej baar-baar chitthee likhakar unhen apane saath milane ke liye manaa rahe hai, udhar unki veerta or parakram ne angreji sena ko dahala diya he-raja bahadur sipaahi avadh main,dhooma machaai more ram re!likh-likh chithiya laat ne bheja,aav milo rana bhai re!jangi khilat landan se mangaa don,avadh main suba banaai re!jab tak praan rahen tan bheetar,tum can khod bahaai re!duusari ore bhukh, akaal or thekedaari pratha ke kashton or jameendaaron ke utpeedan ko prakat karne vaale bhi tamaam geet the
 Satyarthi received one such Karun Gond folk song from Barasivani in Balaghat district
 is geet main gitti todatii stri kaa dard maano aansuon kii jaldhara ke rup main bah aayaa he or sunne vaale ko baar-baar stabdh karata he
 a translation of this folk song by Satyarthi will be read, as if we are reading a recent poem - not a finger on the limb - thirsty - i break the ballast
 
 
 o, maan, main kab tak gitti todatii rahon?is jivan se mujhe ghrinaa ho gai he
 The world sleeps on a hot bed, Diwali is getting cold, o mother, i break the ballast while trembling
 is jangal, pahaad main baskarajab payaal bichhaakar ham sote hai- chaar haath kii gaati baandhakargajab ke jaade main neend nahin aati, payaal jalaakar ham raat bhar jaagate hai
 In such a trouble, i break the ballast, two arrives every day, i will be thinking of the child and the child throughout the life
 o maan, pita ke ghar maine sukh na bhoga, na sasuraal main sukh paaya,o maan, main mar jaati to acha hota! maance to gaya, haddiyaan rah gayi
 Yes, i want to die early and go to heaven and join my hands, Baba, do not give me birth of a man and give birth to someone
 koi pathar-dil shaks hi hoga jisaki ankhen is geet ko padhate samay bhig na jaaen? hamaare daur kaa koi bada se bada kavi bhi is jamini sachai ko itane maarmik alfaaz main kah saktaa he, yakeen nahin aata
 This shows not only the strength of folk songs, but also their documentary significance
 isliye ki unamem apane samay or itihaas kii maarmik goonjen samaai hai
 To be fair, this folk song written on the chest of time in extremely compassionate words is a folk song, which is also a memorable folk song and history of its time! Similarly, the bad times in between also hit the folk songs, due to which the folk songs in them The tears and groans of the people who created it also dissolved
 isiilie aaj unhen padhate hue ankhen nam ho jaati hai or bheetar ek karun lakeer si khinch jaati he
 The painful echoes of the terrible famine that struck in Marwar in 1856 are captured in this song - Chhapaniya Kaal Re Chhapania Kaal, Fer Mat Aiyo Mehari in Marwar
 aayiyo jamido dhadkiyaan jeev,kaan te laaun shakkar, bhaat, gheev, jamido?pher mat aayiyo mhaari marwar main
 Chhapaniya period, Chhapaniya period, Fer mat aayo mahari in Marwar
 bhukhe logon ko mutthi bhar ann dene kaa tarika yah khoja gaya ki bhukhe logon se sadak banavaai jaae
 As such a long road of development is being created in the country and see a picture of how hungry people are making it - Edu Bena Apte Dada, Edu Bena Apte Dadadada Le Vaya, Dada Le Vaya
 jarru ubaam peitta dada, jarru ubaam peitta dadadada le vaya, dada le vaya
 
 
 
 is geet kaa bhav bhi jaraa satyaarthee ji ke shabdon main sunen
 You will understand how a sensitive man's friendship with folklore is and how folklore exposes his meaning before him — that is, what a disaster it is, what a disaster it is, brother, oh brother! Brother, o brother, o brother! There is no food in the stomach, no brother, no food in the stomach, brother, o brother, o brother! What kind of trouble is this brother, what is the problem brother, o brother, o brother Brother blisters in hands, blisters in hands E, o brother, o brother! Everyone is in the hands, brother, everyone is in the hands brother, o brother, o brother! Jamadar is angry with us brother, Jamadar is angry with us brother, o brother, o brother! Sprinkle water, sprinkle water, sprinkle water, o brother, o brother, o brother! Sprinkle water, sprinkle water, sprinkle water brother, brother , o brother, o brother! It is clear that Satyarthi ji has no influence with folk songs
 Hkrta are not that found, ve achche, sarthak, bhavpurn or kaalankit lokgeeton ko na sirf algaate rahe, balki apane lekhon main unki shakti, saundarya or visheshtaon ko unhone baar-baar rekhaankit hi kiya
 Perhaps this is the reason that his collection of folklore, which started in the heart of the mind, became an inexhaustible part of the fight for self-rule
 or unke peeche-peeche chalane or unase prerana lene vaale loksaadhakon kaa puure desh main itnaa bada kafila khadaa ho gaya ki dekhte hi dekhte desh ke har praant, har khand main lok sahitya kaa yah andolan chaa gaya
 Universities, enlightened people and intellectuals of the country are now taking it seriously
 ke
 M
 munshi, vasudevasharan agarwal, shyamacharan dube jaise samaaj-chintakon or sahitya-marmagyon ne hi nahin, verrior elvin or dablyoo
 Yes
 archer jaise antarrashtriya khyaati ke lokachintakon ne bhi bade aadar se satyaarthee ji ke kaam ko yaad kiya or jagah-jagah unke mahatva or unki anokhi or kathin sadhana kaa ullekh kiya
 When Deenbandhu Andrews met in Santiniketan, he filled Satyarthi in his arms
 bole, "lokgeeton par aapke lekh maine padhe hai
 i consider your work a part of the freedom struggle of India! ”similarly, Varrier was so impressed with the work of Alvin Satyarthi that he has mentioned Satyarthi with great respect in his letters and books on folk literature
 gandhi ji to satyaarthee ji ko baar-baar antarang vaarta ke liye bulaate hi the
 He even em
 The Munshi had asked that the room of his residence in Mumbai reserved for Mahatma Gandhi should be opened for this Yatri Yatri
 taaki jab tak vah vahaan rahanaa chaahe, rahe or vahaan kaam karte hue use koi ksht na ho
 After the independence of the country, Satyarthi prepared his first book of folklore in Hindi, 'dharti Gaati Hai', and requested Gandhi to write his role
 jawaab main gandhi ji ne khub utsaah or sneh dikhaaya- "acha to ‘dharti gaati he’ kii hastlikhit prati mere paas chhod jaao
 i would like to say that, this is your request
 yah to aise hi he jaise koi mithe doodh main ek mutthi chini daalane ko kahe
 It is always afraid of spoiling the taste
 phir bhi tum kah rahe ho, to likh doongaa
 
 
 
 'vishaal bharat’, ‘modern rivyuu’ or ‘asia’ main tumhaare lekh baraabar ras se padhata rahaa hoon
 Many articles may have been missed
 kisi khet kii mend par baith tum kisi loakgeet ke chaar bol likh rahe hoge yaa gaanv kii kisi kachi pagadendi par chale ja rahe honge- meh ho, chaahe dhoop chaahe aandhi- aisi kalpana maine kai baar kii he
 "satyarthi's folklore-related articles were published with great respect in the letters 'vishal Bharat', 'modern Review' and 'asia' that Gandhiji has discussed
 or vah ekaek charchaa ke centre main aa gaye the
 'modern Review' and 'asia' were magazines of international fame
 ‘vishaal bharat’ kii bhi hindi main khaasi dhooma thi
 At first Banarasidas Chaturvedi and then in the agnostic 'vishal Bharat' used to specially invite the writings of Satyarthi
 agyeya ne to bade apnatv or aagrah se unhen patr likhaa tha ki unki ichha he unke sampadan main ‘vishaal bharat’ kaa jo pehla ank nikle, usamen satyaarthee ji kaa lekh jarur hona chahie
 And 'modern Review' editor Ramanand Chatterjee was so impressed by the simple simplicity of Satyarthi ji's personality and his exciting folk journeys that he started loving him as his son
 duusari ore gurudev tagore kaa agaadh snehpurn saannnidhya
 In those days Satyarthi used to go anywhere in search of folk songs, wandering and wandering in Santiniketan
 shantiniketan ek tarah se unki yatraaon kaa ‘halt stesan’ tha, jahaan kaa naiysargik vaataavaran or vahaan ke santhal adivaasiyon kaa naikaty unki swachand prakruti ko khub raas aayaa
 Walking on the rough ground of folk literature, Satyarthi's sense of humor soon came into the creative field
 unhone kahani, kavita, upanyaas, niabandh, rekhachitr, aatmakatha, sansmaran-sahitya kii lagbhag har vidha main likhaa or usamen kuch na kuch nayaa or mahatvapurn joda
 'kungposh', 'ikni', 'new God', 'in the middle of the tombs', 'janmabhoomi', 'food God', 'tikuli lost', 'before new paddy', 'road not gun', 'tea' Satyarthi's stories like Rang 'are very popular
 isliye ki inamen unki lok yatraaon ke aise sachche or khare anubhav the, jindagi kii bahut najadik se dekhi gai aisi ajeebogareeb shaklein or garamjoshi thi jo is lokyatri kii kalam se utarane ko maano baichaiyn thi
 Similarly, in Satyarthi's sketches, memoirs and travelogues, his wandering stories are scattered that Manto once wrote a letter to Satyarthi that he wants to go with him to become a happy village, village-city-city, and Krishna Chander
 He had said to a great chant, "brother, give me your happiness too!" And indeed, like Satyarthi ji's open life, his warmly sketched drawings have to be said
 Or
 zyaadaatar rekhachitron main unke nijee jivan ke dastavej or ghumkkadi kii kahaniyaan bikhri padi hai
 Inanimate stones and rivers also speak in that stirring of emotions
 chaahe godavari ho yaa raavi, uski kalakal-chhalchal main satyaarthee ji itihaas kii goonj or yugon kaa naad sunate hai
 He has a strange human relationship with her, with which he starts to grope her heart
 bich-bich main satyaarthee ji apane sukh-dukh kaa aisa samvaad piro dete hai ki maanav-astitv kii ek nai hi pahchaan ubhartee he
 If seen, the autobiography of Satyarthi is scattered here, he has his mark on it
 isi tarah satyaarthee ji kii aatmakatha ‘chaand-suraj ke beeran’ kaa swaad anokhaa he, jisamen punjab kaa lok maanas gahare samaaya hua he
 It is a matter of fact that the autobiography of Satyarthi is the story of the entire inner being, which has everything, but the worldly manipulations and calculations in mathematics
 haan, jameen kii jo ek naiysargik pyaas hoti he, uski samaj unamem he
 He knew the singing, cheering euphoria of the earth and put it into words
 bahut saadhaaran, bahut maamuli paatr hai satyaarthee ji kii aatmakatha main
 Asa Singh, Fattu, Noora Shepherd, Gangi Tai, Ma ji, sister-in-law Dhanwanti, Pandit Ghulluram, Master Kehar Singh
 in logon ke kitne hi kisse satyaarthee ji se sunne ko mili
 But in his autobiography 'chand-suraj Ke Biran', the joy of seeing him flowing in a life stream is something else
 satyaarthee ji kii janmabhumi bhadaud se judi aitihaasik kathaayen or kinvadantiyaan bhi yahan bahut hai or ek balak jisane lokgeeton kaa ras-swaad janaa to vah kuch or hi ho gaya
 He did not remain what he was before
 antarman main ek aisi ajeeb-si pyaas jaag uthi jo use kisi badi bhatakan ke liye taiyaar kar rahi thi
 But with the help of these small characters, small and minor incidents, Satyarthi has created a sweet story-like sweetness of sugarcane

 An autobiography in which the whole of Punjab is absorbed
 punjab kii jameen par palane vaala koi balak jab gabaru jawan hota he to usamen jane kaise puraa saanskrithik parivesh, nahi-nahin, dharti maan kii ras-gandh samaa jaati he, satyaarthee ji ne is jaadu ko khuli aankhon se dekha-samajha he
 Perhaps that is why the deep, true identity of Pandab has emerged in the 'moon and sun' Biran, i have not seen anywhere else

 Because writing is not just with a pen, it requires an open heart, it comes from living a different life and cannot be bought from anywhere

 While reading the 'brahmaputra' created on the agitated land of Assam, it seems as if Satyarthi is familiar with the folk traditions, customs and public culture of Assam since birth, while reading 'katha Kaho Urvashi' is a deception
 Whether they really belong to the family of idol sculptors of Odisha
 ‘doodh-gachh’ padhate hue lagata he- are, ve to mulat: kerala kii jameen or anchalon ke vaasi lagate hai! to ‘kathputli’ or ‘teri kasam sutluj’ ko padhate hue, in upanyaason kii pankti-pankti maano yah gavaahi detii he ki ve theth punjab kii jameen ke sivaa or kahin ke ho hi nahin sakate

 sahitya or kala kii yah sadhana kya bagaiyr ‘hriday kii muktavastha’ ke sambhav he! uske liye ek yatri kaa jo dil, garamjoshi or fakkadi chahie, vah satyaarthee ji main bharpoor he or sach kaha jaae to vahi unka asli khajaana bhi he
 Perhaps that's why Devendra Satyarthi is one of the twentieth-century superstars whose rugged personalities and epigraphic experiences go through dozens of compositions, allowing us to see and understand the modest man with an entire twentieth-century literature, history and a new identity
 The 'new eye' is found
 aaj jab satyaarthee ji nahin hai or sahitya tathaa lokyaan ko apana sarvasv dekar ja chuke hai, to yah kahe bagaiyr nahin rahaa jaataa ki kaash, satyaarthee ji jaise sachche or diggaj lekhakon ko samajhane kii kuch zyada eemaandaar koshishen hamaare yahan hotin! tab sahitya ke naam par nirarthak pantarebaagiyon or chhuchhe shabdon kaa jo khel idhar chal niklaa he, usase nishchit rup se hamen kuch to nijaat milti
 And with renewed vigor, we could accept the challenges of this new century!

 Soldier Mandeep Singh, who was martyred while protecting the nation on Friday, was given a final farewell on the occasion of Diwali
 shahid ko shradhanjali dene ke liye jansailab umada
 During this time there was a great resentment of people towards Pakistan
 ek taraf pakistan murdaabaad ke naare lagaae gaye, to duusari taraf shahid mandeep singh amar rahe ke naare gunjate rahe
 Born and brought up in Aantehadhi village in Kurukshetra district, Haryana, Mandeep Singh was born into a poor peasant family
 pita ke paas kheti ke liye maamuli jameen thi, aise main parivaar ko paalane ke liye unhen trek chalaanaa padaa
 The father is still a truck driver
 betaa sena (sikh regiment) main bhartee hokar parivaar kaa sahaara ban gaya
 If there was no house to live, then the biggest dream was to build our own shelter
 diwaali par nae ghar main grihpravesh tha
 But, ironically, the house that was built with big dreams, the funeral pyre of martyr Mandeep was lit only two meters next to it

 Tejashwi spoke to reporters in Patna before leaving for Ranchi on Friday
 unase poocha gaya ki kya anant singh munger seat se mahagathbandhan ke tikat par chunaav maidan main aana chaahate hai
 Tejashwi's answer to this was that Anant Singh is a bed element and we will not let him come to the party
 tejasvi ne kaha ki jo hamaari vichaardhaara he uske vipareet unki vichaardhaara he, isliye hamaari party main aise logon ke kiye koi jagah nahin hai
 Earlier, Anant Singh had announced that he wanted to contest from Munger seat against NDA candidate Lallan Singh
 ek jamaane main lalan singh ke najdiki maane jane vaale anant aajkal unase naaraaz chal rahe hai
 But after Tejashwi's statement, there is certainly no choice but to become an independent candidate for Anant

 aaj nadi bilkul udhaas thi
 She was asleep in her water, a cloud-clad on her mirror
 maine usko nahin jagaaya,dabe paanv ghar waapas aayaa
 This is a poem by Kedarnath Agarwal
 prakruti se swapn main bhi jo itnaa prem kar saktaa he, vahi aisa garh saktaa he
 Kedarnath Aggarwal, the leading poet of progressive poetry, was born on 1 April 1911 in Kamasin village of Banda district of Uttar Pradesh
 vah prakruti or maanavtaa ko ukerne vaale kavi the
 Father Hanuman Prasad Aggarwal was a poet himself
 'madhurim' naam se unka ek kavy sankalan prakashit bhi hua tha
 Kedar ji got inspiration for poetry creation from his family
 gramin parivesh main rahane ke chalate kedarnath agarwal ke man main saamudayik sanskaar or prakruti ke prati lagaav paidaa hua, jo jivan bhar unki kavitaaon main jhalkata rahaa
 Sitting at the top of the dome, the council is homely, the sweet sunshine of beautiful happiness, Danna is roasting
 taapas vesh nahin he uskaa, vah he ab maharani,tyaag-tapasya kaa fal paakar, ji main bahut aghani
 Kedar listen listen! Maina is the staunch, true-ahimsa ideals, sings the beloved verses
 kedarnath agarwal kaa kavy-sangrah 'yug kii ganga' desh ke aaazaad hone se pehle hi march, 1947 main prakashit hua tha
 This collection is a valuable document for understanding the history of Hindi literature
 kedarnath agarwal jan-gana-man ko maanavtaa kaa swaad chakhaane vaale amar kavi the
 Kedarnath Agarwal was strongly influenced by Marxist philosophy
 ise unhone jivan main bhi apanaaya or srijan main bhi
 He was opposed to any form of exploitation
 samyawad ko jivan kaa aadhaar maanakar unhone jansadharan ke jivan kii gahari va vyapak samvednaaon ko apni kavitaaon main mukherit kiya
 The poems of poet Kedarnath Agarwal find the fragrance and tone of faith in the land of India
 os-boond kahati he; likh dunnav-gulab par man kii baat
 The poet says: Let me also write in my heart the words of the mind
 os-boond likh saki nahin kuchnav-gulab ho gaya maleen
 But the poet wrote a poem on dew senv-rose
 bachapan main ghar-parivaar se mili sanskaron ne unhen garib or peeditvarg ke logon ke sangharmpurn jivan se vaakif hone kaa avasar diya tha
 Later, while attaining legal education, he saw only the means of salvation of this class in Marxism
 yaheen vah pragatisheel vichaardhaara se parichit hue
 This was a period of introspection in his life, from which he later became a dedicated lawyer and a unique poet
 maanavtaa, manushya ke sangharsh unki kavitaaon ke prerak tatv bane
 See its hallmark in his poem titled 'veerangana'
 -maine uskojab-jab dekhaloha dekhalohe jaisaa-tapate dekha-galate dekha-dhalate dekhamaine uskogoli jaisaachalate dekha
 The beginning of Kedarnath Agarwal's poetry journey can be considered from the year 1930
 elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main adhyayan ke dauraan hi unhone likhane kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 His deep connection with Prayag's literary environment can be gauged from the fact that all his main works were published from Parimal Prakashan in Allahabad
 prakaashak sivakumar sahay unhen pitatulya maanate the or 'babuji' kehete the
 It is difficult to find such a deep connection between author and publisher today
 kavita sangrah 'phool nahin rang bolte hai' ke parimal se hi prakashit hone ke baad se kedaar ji ke sabhi prakaashan parimal se hi hue
 As long as Sivakumar was alive as the publisher of Parimal, he held seminars and honors at his residence on every birth anniversary of Kedar
 kedarnath agarwal ko 'jivan se' pyaar yaheen prayag se hua
 There are lines of his poem with the same title - such as come to the cradle of Giri's Shring Sheesh Parrang form, wave the goose goods garland and the rock becomes tan-kanti-niketan body
 kedarnath agarwal kii pragatishiltaa kaa moort aadhaar he bharat kii shramjivi janata
 Marxist philosophy intensified his affection for the masses
 janata ke sangharsh main aasthaa or uske bhavishya main vishwaas unhen isi vichaardhaara se mila
 That is why Kedarnath Aggarwal in his compositions would put forth the brutal oppression of the people and the difficult struggles of the people by the rulers
 unki ek kavita main isaki kii baangi dekhie-landan main bik aayaa netaa, haath kataa kar aayaa,atali-bevin-angrezon main, khoyaa or bilayaa
 The mother-son's son-in-law, but got into the house, of English imperialism, he burnt dinner
 arthniti main raajnneeti main, gaharaa ghota khaaya,janavaadee bharat kaa usne, sab-kuch vahaan ganvaaya
 Kedarnath Agarwal, who believes that poetry makes life sublime, wrote prose in addition to poetry
 unki prakashit lagbhag dhai darjan kritiyon main 23 kavita sangrah, anudit kavitaaon kaa sankalan, niabandh sangrah, upanyaas, yatra-vrittant, saakshaatkaar sankalan or ek patr-sankalan bhi shaamil hai
 His famous poetic collections include 'ganges of Ages',' No flowers, speak colors', 'gulmenhdi', 'hey Meri tum!', 'bolebol Abol', 'jamun Jal tum', 'say Kedar Khari Khari' and ' Mara Pyaar Ki Thapan '
 yatra sansmaran 'basti khile gulabon kii', to upanyaas 'patiyaa', 'bail baaji maar le gayi' naam se chapa
 The collection of essays were published and discussed under the names 'time to time', 'thinking comprehension', 'vivek Vivechan'
 kedaar ji ek kavy-sarjak ke rup main soviet land nehru puraskaar, sahitya academy puraskaar, hindi santhaan puraskaar, tulsi puraskaar, maithilisharan gupt puraskaar se sammanit hue the
 Many of his works were translated into English, Russian and German
 kaviyon kii pratishtha ko lekar vah kehete the, 'kavi chetan sristi ke karta hai
 We poets are Brahma
 kavi ko mahakaal maan nahin saktaa
 i am fighting the same fight
 ' kedaar ji kaa nidhan 22 june, 2000 ko hua

 “the views and suggestions of the members on many issues and all the provisions of the Bill have been ignored
 
 
 
 This has made the entire exercise of the Select Committee useless and it is contrary to the objective of forming the committee
 ” This is stated in the dissent note (decent Note) given along with the report of the Select Committee of Mines and Minerals (amendment) Bill, which has the signature of the mps of the opposition parties
 haalanki mana ja rahaa he ki centre sarkaar ne khan or khanij (sanshodhan) vidheyak ko paas karaane ke liye kai partiyon se talmail kar liya he or vah is bill ko paas karaane ke liye sankhya juta legi
 But even now many mps are saying that this bill can be challenged in the court if passed in the current form
 sarkaar is bill main sabhi maujuuda khadaanon ke theke 30 saal se badhaakar 50 saal karne kaa prastaav kar rahi he
 This, on the one hand, violates the right of the states to extend or not extend the lease for the auction of minerals, but also raises the question whether the Goa, Bellary or Shah Commission investigation does not automatically renew the lease of existing mines
 Will happen
 sarkaar kah rahi he ki kanoon main sanshodhan kar vah nilaamee kaa rasta khol rahi he, taaki koyale kii tarj par louh ayask or boxite jaise khanijon se adhik kamai kii ja sake
 But in this bill, there is a provision that the companies which have been given permits and prospective licenses for the survey will remain with those companies
 aaj desh main zyaadaatar gyaat khanij bhandaron ke sarven permit or prospective license die ja chuke hai
 In such a situation, the question of whether the government's auction claim will prove to be effective, because very few mines will be left with the government for auction
 salect cameti kii baithak main uthe sawaalon main ek mahatvapurn sawaal he ki nilaamee ke vakt panchayat raaj kanoon or van adhikaar kanoon ke saath pisa jaise kanoonon ke paalan ke paryaapt praavdhaan is kanoon main rakhe nahin hai
 The question is whether the government will bring amendments to the bill in this regard
 desh ke zyaadaatar khanij adivasee ilaakon main hai jahaan in kanoonon kii ahmiyat kaaphi bad jaati he
 In the Select Committee, a question has also been raised on this law that the companies to whom mining contracts should be given should spend a substantial part of the profits on the welfare of tribals and the development of those areas
 vidheyak main kaha gaya he ki is bare main banane vaali mineral foundation main koun log honge ye tay karne kaa adhikaar rajyon ke paas he
 Experts say that there should be a compulsion in the law that the people of the affected areas should be kept in this foundation
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar vipaksh se talmail bithaane ke liye is bill main ek–do sanshodhan kare
 During this debate in the Select Committee, this demand also arose that the money should go directly into the account of tribals for tribal welfare
 lekin abhi ek bada sawaal ye bhi he ki kya vidheyak vastav main companiyon par paryaapt paisa kharch karne kii shart lagaataa he
 The proposed bill in 2011 said that companies would deposit the same amount of royalties paid to the government for the welfare of tribal and local people
 isse pehle 2010 ke kanoon main to munaafe kaa 26 fisadi kharch karne kii baat kahi gai thi, lekin loksabhaa se paarit bill main is kharch ko roylty ke ek tihaai tak simit kiya gaya he
 The question is whether the government will bring amendments in this regard or will it accept the opposition's amendment

 The Bharatiya Janata Party's plank in Bargaining seems to be heavy on the seat-sharing in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for the Bihar elections
 hindustani avam morcha ke adhyaksh jeethanram maanjhi ne guuruuvaar ko saaf kiya ki is maamle main bijepi jo faisla legi, unhen manjuur hoga

 rajasthan ke jariye antarrashtriya seemaa ko paar kar pakistan jane vaale bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon ko rokane main aaj tak kamyaabi nahin mil saki he
 But now this issue has taken a more serious form
 8 july ko jaisalmer se lagati antarrashtriya seemaa ke nikat tanot kshetra main ek bangladeshi ghuspaithiya pakadaa gaya jiske paas se bhartiya nirvachan ayog kaa farji matadaata pahchaan patr mila
 39-year-old Shahidul Islam, who was arrested by BSF, wrote the address of 24 Northern Parganas on the voter ID card recovered from him while he is a resident of Dhaka
 is ghatana ke paanch din pehle hi barmer ke munaabaav kshetra se ek ghuspaithiya bangladeshi maulavee pakadaa gaya tha, uske paas se bhi farji matadaata pahchaan patr mila tha
 Barmer Superintendent of Police Hemant Sharma says, "through the voter ID card, he had issued a SIM in India
 pakade jane ke baad usne sim todakar phenk di
 He has got some maps also, so the suspicion is even deeper
 ”shamsuddin naam kaa yah maulavee jiarapy castady se faraar hone main bhi kaamyaab ho gaya tha
 For four days he lived as a cleric in a madrasa in Barmer under the nose of intelligence agencies
 haalanki baad main vah phir suraksha agenciyon ke hathe chadh gaya
 It is worth mentioning that after Shamsuddin was caught, intelligence agencies received threats from the terrorist organization lashkar-e-taiba to blow up ten railway stations in Rajasthan including Barmer
 khufia agenciyaan is dhamkee ko gambhirtha se le rahi hai
 Last month also, BSF caught four Bangladeshi infiltrators near the border of Pakistan with Jaisalmer
 inamen se teen ke paas bharat ke farji matadaata pahchaan patr mili the
 Last month, four Bangladeshi intruders were also caught in the border Tanot region
 ayasin miyaan naam kaa aadmi sohail miyaan, junab ali or junayd ahamed naam ke baaki ke teen ghuspaithiyon ko benpole kshetra se lagati bangladeshi seemaa se bharat laayaa tha
 During interrogation, these intruders said that they had entered the Indian border on 1 March
 mohammad ayasin naam kaa ek aadmi unhen belgaum se malda laayaa tha
 Here he stayed in the house of a local man named Abdul Kalam for a week
 kalam ne inkaa farji pahchaan patr banwaaya tha jiske bal par ye chaaron malda railway stesan se dilli aae or yahaan unhone local sim bhi kharidi thi
 According to BSF officials, during interrogation of Ayasin Mian, it has been found that he has already visited Pakistan twice through the international border with Jaisalmer
 idhar se vah naukari karne iran tak gaya tha
 This gave him courage but was caught trying to infiltrate for the third time
 (farji bhartiya voter card)seemaa paar se aane vaale bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon kii taadaad teji se bad rahi he
 Explaining the reason, a senior BSF official says, "the previous central government had instructed Bangladeshi infiltrators coming from across the border to use light weapons
 isliye salbhar main ghuspaithiyon ko maar giraane kaa aankada 100 se ghatakar 9 rah gaya he
 "the UPA government had asked the BSF to use light weapons such as pump action guns on intruders coming from across the international border from Bangladesh
 saaf he vot bank kii raajnneeti ne bharat kii simaaon ko behad asurakshit kar diya he
 The number of Bangladeshis going to Iran in search of employment is also increasing rapidly
 ye log bharat kii seemaa main avaidh rup se ghuskar pakistan jate hai or vahaan se iran kii raah pakad lete hai
 Since 2011, more than 55 Bangladeshi infiltrators have been caught who wanted to go to Iran via Pakistan
 desh ko surakshit rakhana he to simaaon ko chaak chauband karnaa hoga
 The government will also have to take some tough steps to rise above vote bank politics

 Foreign investment from China has increased more than 6 times compared to 2014 due to mutual trust
 vahiin bharat ke mukaable china kaa bharat main niryaat kaaphi baari bharkam he
 Talking about statistics, there is a huge disparity between the exports of Tochene and India
 yahaan china bharat main lagbhag 7 arab dollar kaa niryaat karata he, vahiin bharat kaa china main niryaat mahaz 16 million dollar he
 On the other hand, if we talk about foreign investment, China invested one billion dollars in 2014 and in 2015 itself increased to 6 million dollars
 china ke menuphaccharing sector ke liye bharat ek pasandida destination he, jisko vah gavaana nahin chahta
 In fact, due to the recent ruckus in US President Donald Trump's US First Policy and China's relationship, China is also looking for a new and strong market and somewhere he too knows that he cannot find a better market than India
 visheshgyon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki agar bharat or china aapas main hi ladenge or kootnithik rishton ke saath saath aarthik rishte main bhi tanaav aata he, to iskaa phayda pashchimi deshon ko milegaa
 In such a situation, both should exercise to remove mutual tension, while the importance of each other should not be underestimated

 The 200-meter long road connecting the Cant flyover is buzzing with the vehicles of BSP leaders as early as 10 am
 alag-alag jilon se bulaae gaye bispi netaa party kii rashtriya adhyaksh mayawati se milane 13 maal avenue sthit unke awaas par ek-ek kar pahunchane lagate hai
 This cycle continues till eight o'clock at night
 pichley do maheene se mayawati lagaataar lakhanu main deraa daale agle vidhansabha chunaav ke liye bispi sanghathan ko dhar dene main juty hui hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, the BSP failed to win a single seat due to lack of ground reality
 isse sabak lete hue mayawati ab pichhali galatiyon ko doharaana nahin chaahatin
 The field committees formed during the Lok Sabha elections have now been replaced by the sector committees, with direct feedback from which Mayawati is winding up on the political ground of UP
 inhen samitiyon se mili gopneey jaankaree se ve vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye apane purv ghoshit ummidavaaron kaa tikat kaatane main bhi nahin hichak raheen
 In the last three months, more than 30 BSP candidates have been replaced in different seats
 pichley vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav se itar is baar mayawati ne upi se judi har ghatana par sidhe media ke saamne apni party kaa paksh rakhkar virdohi partiyon ke aaropon ke bich bani shoonyata ko bharne kaa prayaas kiya he
 The results of the Legislative Council elections, which came on 10 June after two years for the BSP, have given new blood
 vidhansabha main agar sankhya bal ko dekhen to us hisaab se bispi apane do ummidavaaron ko hi vidhaan parishad chunaav main jita paane kii haisiyat main thi, lekin duusare dalon ke 14 vidhayakon ne hathi kii tarafdaari kar uske tisare ummidavaar kii bhi naiya paar laga di
 The organization became accountable This time, compared to the previous assembly and Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati has tried to make the BSP organization more accountable and effective at the booth level
 sanghathan ko nau jone main baant diya gaya he
 Under the new system, there will now be coordinators at the divisional level and in-charge at the zone level
 ek-ek jone main kai incharge honge, lekin unke paas tay mandal kii hi jimmedaari hogi
 This has made officials directly accountable
 mayawati har maheene ke pehle hafte main in padaadhikariyon ke saath baithak kar khud har vidhansabha kshetra kaa ''feedback" le rahi hai
 Mayawati has fielded her "booth cadre" to respond to the Congress's "team PK", sp's "akhilesh Brigade" and bjp's "modi-shah jugalbandi"
 iske tahat ab pradesh vidhansabha kshetra ko booth str par alag-alag bhaagon main baanta ja rahaa he
 Take Agra, for example
 bispi ne jile ke nau vidhansabha kshetron ko 40 sector main baanta he
 Each sector has 300 to 350 booths by area
 pichley saal aktubar tak sabhi sector cametiyaan ban gai thim or ab booth str par cameti banane kaa kaam bhi 80 fisadi puraa ho chukaa he
 Mayawati has started social engineering at the booth level
 jis booth par jis samaaj kaa vot adhik he, usee jati kaa booth adhyaksh banaaya ja rahaa he
 Four organization secretaries are being appointed at each booth, who are pro-kharti supporters of BSP
 bispi ke ek rajya padaadhikari bataate hai ki booth cameti ko nirdhaarit lakshya dekar baithkon kaa roster pehle se hi tay kar diya jaataa he
 To oversee these meetings is a team of divisional and district level officials, who oversee them like a "flying squad"
 dalit-muslim-pichhadaa sameekaran2017 kaa vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke liye mayawati ne pehali baar dalit-muslim-pichhadaa sameekaran par bharosa jataayaa he
 As many as 100-100 Muslim and Dalit people have been made in-charge of the assembly, which is a possible BSP candidate for the BSP
 iske alaava 70 vidhansabha siton par ati pichhadaa varg or 50 par brahman jati se prabhariyon kii tainaati hui he
 This is different from the bsp's earlier strategy when Mayawati gave tickets to 88 Dalits, 85 Muslims and 74 Brahmins in the 2012 assembly elections
 purvanchal ke ek bispi jonal koordinator bataate hai ki jin siton par dalit or musalmaan kii saajha aabaadi 30 pratishat yaa isse zyada he, vahaan par muslim yaa dalit ummidavaar utaare gaye hai
 Mayawati is not only deciding candidates by taking feedback from the sector committees present at the assembly level, but the candidates declared are being replaced
 upi kii sarvaadhik samvedansheel faijabad kii ayodhya vidhansabha seat se bijepi or sapa dwaara savarna pratyaashiyon ke utarane kii sambhaavna dekhakar mayawati ne pichhadi jati se ghoshit ummidavaar jayakaran verma kaa tikat katkar musalmaan pratyaashee bajmi siddiki par daanv lagaaya he
 Mayawati has fielded all her senior leaders this time without taking any risk in the assembly elections
 kabhi bispi ke garh rahe ambedkar nagar kii akbarpur seat se party ke pradesh adhyaksh ram achal rajbhar ko inke putr sanjay rajbhar kii daavedaari nirast kar pratyaashee banaaya gaya he
 Swami Prasad Maurya won the last election from Paduna in Kushinagar, but this time he will contest from Unchahar seat of Rae Bareli
 sector cametiyon se mili feedback par or anushaasan todgaye par pichley teen maheene main mayawati ne teen darjan se adhik siton par ummidavaar badale hai
 On 4 June, Mayawati reached the BSP headquarters in Mall Avenue, Morchalakhanu, against the BJP, as part of a well-conceived strategy, to blame the Congress for the bjp's victory in the Assam Assembly elections
 ve boleen, ''congress ne assam main chote dalon ke saath gathbandhan nahin kiya, jisase bijepi jeet gai
 "mayawati may have named Congress in the context of Assam, but the target was UP
 uttarakhand main congress kii sarkaar bachaane ke baad uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh or uttarakhand ke rajyasabha chunaavon main congress ummidavaaron kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaakar mayawati kendriya str par bijepi ke khilaaf ek morcha banane or is tarah duvidha main pade upi ke musalmaan voton kaa vishwaas jeetne kii koshish main hai
 a top BSP official says that Mayawati is not in the mood to tie up with any party at the moment, but she wants to be mobilized from now on for the post-assembly elections
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke baad daliton ke bich paith badhaane kii bijepi kii koshishen mayawati ko sabase zyada akhar rahi hai
 Under the leadership of BJP national president Amit Shah, the BSP has launched a "bahujan Bhoja" program to cut down on the dalits of party functionaries eating at their homes
 vidhansabha str par yojit hone vaale bahujan bhoj kaarykram main bispi ke dalit jonal koordinator ilaake ke dalit netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke saath bhojan kar daliton ke utthan ke liye pichhali bispi sarkaar ke yogadan se judi ek patali kitaab baant rahe hai
 Seeing the inclination of educated Dalits towards bjp's development agenda, Mayawati is also making it clear in every rally and press conference that she will no longer build a memorial if her government is formed in the state, but in education, health, employment, industry
 Will work in the area

 While inflation has reminded the common man the price of flour and pulses, Ravan's 'stature' has also decreased due to this
 vijaydashami yaa dashahra par deshbhar main ravan ke saath kumbhakarna or meghnad kaa putala jalaane kii parampara sadiyon se chali aa rahi he
 The work of making effigies at various places in Delhi starts two to two and a half months before Vijayadashami and the effigies are seen being placed on the side of the roads
 lekin is saal mahangaai kii maar ke saath rashtramandal khelon kii vajah se lagi paabandiyon ke chalate putale banane kaa kaam kaaphi dhimaa chal rahaa he
 According to the mannequin-making artisans, the demand for mannequins has dropped significantly this year
 putale banane main kaam aane vaali saamagree ke daam pichley saal kii tulana main dogune ho chuke hai
 Also, due to the Commonwealth Games, very few orders of mannequins have been received this time
 isse ravan kaa kad ghat gaya he yani chote putalon ke order hi mil rahe hai, vahiin iske bhav bhi bad chuke hai
 On the other hand, buyers of Kumbhakarna and Meghnad effigies are not available
 pashchimi dilli kaa tatarpur gaanv pichley kai saalon se ravan ke putalon kaa pramukh centre rahaa he
 According to the artisans here, this time the demand for mannequins has come down considerably due to the Commonwealth Games along with inflation
 pichley saal tak jahaan 50 foot ke putalon kaa daam 5,000-6,000 hajaar rupee tha, vahiin is saal yah 8,000 se 9,000 rupee par pahunch gaya he
 Mahendra and Subhash Ravan Wale k Mahendra says, "last year the price of the effigies of Ravana was Rs 100-125 per foot, while this time it has reached Rs 150 to 200 per foot
 ’’ kareeb 35 baras se ravan ke putale bana rahe mahendra ne kaha, ‘‘is saal ravan ke putale banane kii saamagree kaaphi mahangi ho gai he
 Last year 20 bamboos were available for Rs 800 to 900, while this year their price has reached Rs 1,700-1,800
 ’’ tatarpur gaanv kii pahchaan ravan ke putalon kii vajah se hi he
 Here in the seventies, Chutan Lal started making effigies of Ravana
 is vajah se unka naam ‘ravan vaala baba’ pad gaya tha
 Today many of his Shargid are carrying on this tradition
 putala banane vaale karigar mukhyat: uttar pradesh or haryana se aate hai
 Naresh Kumar, another Shargid of Ravana Wala Baba, states that 1,500 Ravana effigies were made every year in Tatarpur
 par is baar yah aankada zyada se zyada 1,000 par hi pahunch paaegaa
 Artisan Subhash, who came here from Karnal in Haryana to make mannequin, said that he comes to Tatarpur every year from August to October
 baaki mahinaa main kisi factory main kaam karte hai
 Naresh says that in Tatarpur we make Ravana ranging from five to fifty feet
 is baar mahangaai kii vajah se order kam aa rahe hai
 He said that this time due to the Commonwealth Games, along with inflation, there is a lot of difficulty in keeping effigies around the roads
 rashtramandal khelon kii vajah se jo bandishen lagaai gai hai, usase ramlila ke aayojak abhi order dene se kataraa rahe hai
 Artisans say that the demand for effigies of Ravana has decreased, so orders are not being received for the effigies of Kumbhakarna and Meghnad
 ek anya karigar praveen ne kaha ki tatarpur ke ravan dilli ke alaava haryana or uttar pradesh tak jate hai
 This time too, orders have been received from these states
 ‘‘kabhi yahaan ke putale austrailia, canada or america tak jate the
 But now orders of mannequins are not received from abroad
 ’baliwood kii ek film ke ravan dahan ke drishy ke liye putala bana chuke mahendra kehete hai, ‘‘is kaam main ab vah aaksharn nahin bachaa he, jo 15-20 saal pehle hota tha
 i will not bring my children into this profession
 ’ mahendra ne bataaya ki pichley saal unhone 100 putale banaae the, par is saal abhi tak 25 putalon ke hi order mili hai
 He will make only four-five effigies of Kumbhakarna and Meghnad
 baharhaal sadiyon puraani is parampara ko jivit rakhane vaale in kaarigaron kii ummid is baat par tiki he ki rashtramandal khel samaapt hone ke baad paabandiyaan hatengi or ramlila aayojakon kii ashankaayen dur hongi, jisase unhen putalon ke order milenge

 BSP chief Mayawati said she could not support the Centre's direction of FDI in multi-brand retail and her party would make its final decision on FDI clear at the time of voting in Parliament
 mayawati ne kaha ki khudara kshetra main epadiai kaa matlab he, desh main adhik munaafe vaale kshetra main videshi companiyon ko munafa kamaane kaa adhikaar denaay aisi sthiti main ‘hamaari party or desh kii janata kaa maananaa he ki isse kisaan, chote-chote dukandaar or kutir udyog aadi tabah ho jaayenge
 He said that this will directly affect the poor people, the country's economy will collapse and the country will again go into the hands of foreign traders

 Rejecting the central government's plea to reduce inflation by allowing FDI in multi-brand retail, the BSP chief said that the government's assertion was not correct
 jab tak utpaadan nahin badhegaa or logon ko samuchit dar par khadyann nahin muhaiyaa hoga, tab tak mahangaai nahin ghategi
 Referring to the discussion on the issue of FDI in multi-brand retail in Parliament, Mayawati said, 'the party will decide its stand in Parliament at the time of voting on this subject
 ’mayawati ne kendra ko salaah di, ‘centre sarkaar pehle congress shasit rajyon main epadiai ke prabhaavon kaa adhyayan kare or phir sansadeey samiti se samiksha karaane ke baad hi is par koi antim nirnay kare
 Because it is not right to make a decision on it without studying its effects
 ’ unhone kaha ki aaj kii sthiti main party iskaa prabhaav dekhe bina iskaa samarthan nahin kar sakati
 The BSP chief said that there is only one positive aspect in this policy of the Center that there is such an arrangement that whatever the state wants it will implement and no state has been imposed on it
 mayawati ne kaha ki is vishay par vichaar karte hue party ke samaksh ek ahm prashn yah bhi he ki kya party sampradayik tatwon kii ore se pesh prastaav ke saath khadi najar aae
 He said that the party is also waiting for the reply of the Center in this regard

 input :bhashaa Senior BJP leader LK Advani credited the party's impressive victory in the Lok Sabha elections to the Congress, stating that the huge corruption and mistakes of previous governments in the last ten years contributed to his party's victory
 2014 ke aam chunaavon ko abhootpurv bataate hue unhone kaha ki party kaaryakartaaon ne chunavi jang main kadi mehnat kii
 After hoisting the tricolor flag at his residence, Advani said, 'I have seen all the elections since 1952
 jab 2014 ke chunaav khatm hue, maine mahasoos kiya ki mere apane liye or party ke liye yah chunaav abhootpurv the
 i was elated because such results have never come before
 hamaare party kaaryakartaaon ne in chunaavon main kadi mehnat kii
 However, he said, "but i will not deny that much of the contribution to this victory was from the opposition who were fighting against me
" agar unhone itani badi-badi galtiyaan nahin kii hotin or agar log beete 10 varsh main itane adhik bhrashtachar kaa gavaah nahin bane hote, to is tarah ke parinaam sambhavat: nahin aae hote
 The BJP won 282 seats in the Lok Sabha elections and became the first party to win an absolute majority in more than two decades
 'adwani ne kaha, 'narendra modi ke netritv main bade abhiyaan ne bhi jeet main yogadan diya
 But the biggest contribution was from our opposition
 unhone kaha, 'shandaar jeet kii vajah se hamase ummiden bhi bad gai hai
 ' 16 may kii subah narendra modi or bijepi ke liye ek nai udaan lekar ai
 Day by day, Narendra Modi had written history
 itihaas na sirf apane dam par 300 se bhi zyada siten laane kaa balki 1984 ke baad pehali aisi party banane kaa bhi jise purna bahumat mila tha
 But even for Narendra Modi, everything was not so easy
 jaahir he jab safalataa itani badi thi to manzil tak pahunchane ke liye kai mushkil raaston se bhi guzarana padaa hoga
 Narendra Modi's biggest problem was his fierce opponents
 jinhone narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhane main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Some were calling Modi a merchant of death and some were saying demon
 lekin modi par aise hamalon kaa koi asar nahin hua
 We tell you some such statements of anti-narendra Modi leaders wherein they had claimed that Narendra Modi can never become the Prime Minister of this country
 sabase pehle baat congress sarkaar main kabhi kendriya mantri rahe manishankar ayyar kii jinhone 17 janvari 2014 ko ek tivi intervyuu main bade hi aatmavishvaas se kaha tha, 'narendra modi is desh ke pradhanmantri nahin banenge, nahin banenge, nahin banenge
 'the second number is that of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar among the strongest opponents of Narendra Modi
 3 april 2014 ko aaj tak se khaas baatcheet main nitish ne kaha tha ki narendra modi kaa pradhanmantri bananaa asambhav he
 The third number is that of Congress leader Kapil Sibal
 kapil sibbal ne 2 may 2014 ko aaj tak se baat karte hue kaha tha ki bharat jaise loktantric desh main narendra modi kaa pradhanmantri bananaa asambhav he
 But in today's date, Alam is that Kapil Sibal could not save even his seat
 chauthaa number rajd supremeo lalu prasad yadav kaa he
 Lalu Yadav, known for his brazenness, had also confidently claimed that Narendra Modi's dream of becoming Prime Minister will always remain a dream
 lekin chunaav ke nateezon ke baad lalu ke hi puure raajnneetik karier par prashnchihn lagane laga he
 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also never considered Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate
 narendra modi hameshaa se unke nishane par rahe
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, who describes himself as the Messiah of the Muslims of the country, was also less
 7 april ko ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karte hue mulaayam singh bhi ye daawa kar gaye ki narendra modi is desh ke pradhanmantri nahin ban sakate
 After the results, the Alam is that the Samajwadi Party has won only 2 seats in the entire UP
 ye to kuch gine chune netaa the lekin narendra modi par hamalaa karne vaale netaaon kii fehrist yaheen nahin thamati
 In this list there were many veteran leaders like Sushil Kumar Shinde, Akhilesh Yadav, Naresh Aggarwal, Swami Agnivesh and Beni Prasad Verma
 lekin narendra modi ne saare daavon ko chota sabit karte hue in sab se kahin aage nikal gaye
 Now the country is seeing a new hope for a better tomorrow in Narendra Modi
 agasta viviipi helicopter ghotaale ke maamle main sibiai kii vishesh adaalat ne somvaar ko purv airchif marshall espi tyaagi ko jamaanat de di he
 The court granted bail to Tyagi on the condition that he would not try to influence the witnesses or the investigation process in any way
 vaayu sena ke purv pramukh tyaagi ko jamaanat ke rup main do lakh rupee bhi jamaa karne ko kaha gaya he
 Significantly, former Air Force chief SP Tyagi is currently in judicial custody
 unhone adaalat se maang kii thi ki unki jamaanat par sunwaayee teji se kii jaae, lekin sibiai ne jamaanat kaa virodh karte hue apane tark pesh karne ke liye kuch or samay maanga tha

 There was a stir in the country's politics after the decision of an Italian court regarding the deal
 kaha ja rahaa he ki yah theka paane ke liye company ne bhartiya adhikariyon ko 100-125 karod rupee tak kii rishwat di thi
 Former IAF Chief SP Tyagi also appeared in the Italian court's decision
 sibiaiki taraf se court main pesh eesg tushaar mehta ne kaha ki sibiai ke paas abhi jo record hai ve kaaphi zyada hai or unhen padhane tathaa taarkik tareeke se maamle ko pesh karne ke liye agency ko or samay chahie
 Tyagi's lawyer defended the court and said that the investigation is still in the preliminary stages
 yah aarthik aparaadh he or saare sakshya dastavejon ke rup main hai
 The CBI has also never alleged that Tyagi has ever attempted to tamper with any evidence or run away
 isliye aisi kisi ashanka ke na rahane par tyaagi ko jamaanat milani chahie
 Tyagi's lawyer also said that he is 72 years old and has undergone bypass surgery of his heart
 vah jaanch main puraa sahyog kar rahe hai
 Tyagi's counsel said that the CBI was justifying the case on the basis of the decision of the Italian appellate court, while the Supreme Court of Italy rejected it
 media jagat main kabhi dhamal machaane vaali or ab lupt ho chuki puraani kahawat 'oont kis karavat baithegaa' phir se surkhiyon main he
 This is also reasonable as the three sides of the camel Shaheen sitting in the desert of Dubai have beaten every form of football experts
 shanivaar raat italy kii jeet ke saath hi footbal kii bhavishyaani ke maamle main shaheen ne hetric gol daag diya he
 Significantly, after the last two predictions, Shaheen had said on Saturday that Italy would win the match between England and Italy
 der raat puri duniya ne is sach ko jiyaa
 Earlier, Shaheen predicted that Brazil would beat Croatia
 baat sach nikali or mejabaan team 3-1 se jeeta
 Shaheen made a second prediction that the Netherlands would beat the World Cup winner Spain and this also proved to be true
 
 
 
 So Argentina will win Jitkul Milkar in 2010 Octopus Paul Baba's shortage has now been fulfilled by this camel of Dubai
 teen bhavishyavaaniyan or teenon sahi
 By the way, Shaheen has been predicted for the World Cup match between Argentina and Bosnia and Herzegovinia on Sunday
 shaheen ne apane chiparichit andaaj main do board main se argentina ke board ko daanton tale dabaakar bhavishyavaanee kar di he ki ravivaar ko argentina kii jeet hogi
 However, the way Shaheen's predictions are coming true, football fans are beginning to believe that Shaheen, like Paul Baba, will soon predict which team will win in the World Cup
 lekin philhal sabhi kii nigahen ravivaar ko hone vaale match par he
 So it will be interesting to see and you too keep an eye on how this 'camel sits on the side'

" ’’ullekhneey he ki gat 12 or 13 june ko patna main yojit bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak se pehle sthaneey akhabaaron main nitish or narendra modi ke ek-duusare kaa haath thame chhapi tasviir vaale vigyaapan or usamen kosi barh peediton kii gujarat sarkaar dwaara madad kiye jane kii charchaa, par nitish kii tikhi pratikriya ke baad bhaajapa or jad (you) ke bich gathbandhan main sankat paidaa ho gaya tha
 The advertisement said that the Gujarat government has generously helped in the relief of the victims of the floods in the Kosi river in 2008
 nitish ne kadi aapatti jataate hue ne kaha tha ki ‘‘yah asabhy baat he or kisi kii madad karne ke baad dhol nahin peeta jaataa
 Expressing displeasure, Nitish had said in two words that how can anyone print this picture without his permission and said that action should be taken on the said advertisement
 unhone bhaajapa pratinidhiyon ke sammaan main yojit raatri bhoj ko bhi radd kar diya tha
 Bebak / Krishnagopal Mishra After the removal of Article 370 from the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and his ministers are repeatedly threatening India for nuclear war
 aaj phir ek ore pakistani kshitij se bhartiya simaaon par bheeshan yuddh ke vinaashkari badal umad rahe hai or duusari ore bharat sahit sampurna vishwa mahatma gandhi kii 150 veen varshganth dhoomdhaam se manaane kii taiyaariyon main vyast he
 The duality of non-violence and violence, love and malice continues
 is dwandv ke kaaran or parinaam gambhir vimarsh kii apeksha karte hai
 This discussion can be understood well with the help of reflections emerging in the mirror of mythology; Mistakes of the past can be reviewed, which are also necessary to be done and through them a future public strategy can be devised
 jis prakaar bhautik or prakritik jagat paraspar virdohi tatwon se nirmit hai
 They also contain poisons and life-giving medicines; If there are infinite resources of happiness, there is also an infinite ocean full of scarcity of scarcity, similarly the human mind is also enriched by conflicting emotions like love-hate, peace-anger, enthusiasm-fear etc
 jivan inke santulan par tikaa he
 Giving more importance to one of these, completely rejecting the other, is to disrupt the balance, but sometimes on the face of history, such great human beings appear who ignore this balance and keep their forward tendency towards the truth to this extent Let's say that the life-path of the common man gets truncated
 mahabharat kaal main dharmraj yudhisthir ne or beesvin shatabdi ke purvardh main mahatma gandhi ke chintan ne santulan kii upeksha kar saamaajik jivan ko anjaane hi dur tak sankatapann kiya he 
 It is practically proven that history repeats itself
 kaal or paatr badal jate hai, ghatnaon kaa swaroop bhi paryaapt parivartit ho jaataa he, kintu vichaar or kaary lagbhag samroop rahete hai
 This is a repeat of history, but the irony is that humans, knowing the history, while making the acquaintance of the consequences of the events in the past, make the same errors which have proved fatal in the past
 bhartiya samaaj or sahitya main itihaas kaa yah duharaav dharmraj yudhisthir or mahatma gandhi ke vyaktitv or krititv main pag-pag par parilakshith hota he
 Dharmaraj Yudhishthira is truthful, tolerant and in every circumstance he is willing to suffer brotherhood himself
 yahi pravriti mahatma gandhi ke swabhaav main bhi dikhaai detii he
 They are also desirous of friendship with the separatist Muslim mentality and are ready to accept every condition of it
 khilaafat-andolan se lekar bharat-vibhaajan tak kii lagbhag samast ghatnaayen is tathy ko rekhaankit karti hai
 Just as all the efforts of Yudhishthira before the Kauravas fail and the coronation arising out of Duryodhana's ambition leads to the partition of Hastinapur, similarly all efforts of Mahatma Gandhi are fruitless and eventually the separatist diplomacy of Partition of India becomes successful
 
 yahaan tatkaaleen bhartiya netritv ke pratik purush mahatma gandhi yah vismrit kar dete hai ki rajya kaa vibhaajan vighatnkaaree algaavvaadi soch kaa sarthak or sthaayee samaadhaan nahin he
 If it were, after the two independent states of Hastinapur and Indraprastha became part of the envy of the Kauravas towards the Pandavas, the rulers of both the states would have lived happily within their borders but this did not happen and after the Hastinapur-state partition the Pandavas a new attempt to hand over Indraprastha, made with the effort of K, started again
 thik yahi sthiti bharat vibhaajan kii vibheeshikaa ke uparaant dikhaai detii he
 Pakistan started creating new problems for India as soon as it came into existence
 jo ek ghar main nahin rah sakaa vah padosi banakar bhi shanti se nahin baitha
 The authentic learning of history that the partition of the country is not the right treatment for the malicious madness - the leadership of modern India has completely neglected and laid the foundation of a new Mahabharata, whose bugle has been ringing for the past 70 years and now the Mahasangram Ka Shankhanad is eager for the gruesome destruction, indicated by U
K
 Prime Minister Mr
 Imran Khan
 en
 a
 ke manch se diye gayi bayaan main spashtatah miltaa he
 The high ideals and harmony of Dharmaraja Yudhishthira propound his greatness, making him respectable and dignified, but devious mindsets like Dhritarashtra, Shakuni and Duryodhana do not accept Yudhishthira's warmth
 inaki satta lolupata yudhisthir kii shantipriyata ko kaayarta samaj kar uskaa uphaas karti he
 The same situation can be seen in the politics of modern India when the so-called Quaid Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah's demand for a separate country, filled with a sense of malaise, threatens 'direct action' by rejecting all the persuasion of Mahatma Gandhi to massacre innocent Hindus
 Promotes and eventually Pakistan believes it only by building
 yahaan koi satyagrah safal nahin hota
 Here all the divinities of love, non-violence, fraternity and co-existence are seen dying before a ruthless viciousness
 yadi samay rahete kisi vyaadhi kaa samuchit upachaar na kiya jaae to vah dhire-dhire pusht hokar pranaghatak ban jaati he
 The state of Hastinapur in the Mahabharata did not cure the criminal conspiratorial mindset of Shakuni and Duryodhana in blind sonship
 parinamtah bachapan main bhim ko vish dene vaali krur maansikta antat kurukshetra ke maidan main bhayanak sanhaar kaa kaaran bani
 The seed of poisoning of the Partition of India also grew and flowered, irrigated by the appeasement of Mahatma Gandhi's appeasement, and caused the Holocaust and displacement of millions of Hindus and Sikhs as soon as Pakistan was formed
 yadi jyeshtha panduputr yudhisthir ne apane uttardaayitv kaa samyak nirvaah karte huye duryodhana dwaara bhim ko vish die jane par uchit pratikriya dekar bhishma-dhritarashtra aadi se nyaay kii maang kii hoti to bahut sambhav tha kii shadyantr kaa bhandaphod hone par shakuni ko hastinapur se nishkasit kar diya jaataa tathaa duryodhana ke aparipakv kishor-man ko sanskaarit-parishkrut kar nai rachanaatmak disha diya janaa sambhav ho jaataa or tab itihaas ko mahabharat kaa bheeshan sanhaar na dekhnaa padataa
 The same mistake that Yudhishthira made by dusting off the cruel acts of Shakuni and Duryodhana was repeated in the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi by giving more importance to Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who made a disastrous demand for partition of India
 yadi mohammadli jinna ke sthaan par abdul gaffaar khan jaise anya udaar vichaaron vaale netaaon ko aage kar kattartavaadi muslim lig kii maang ko hatotsahit kiya jaataa to bahut sambhav tha ki vibhaajan kii traasadee kaa abhishaap hamen naa jhelana padataa
 Blind ideal blindness - Love not only self, but also cause trouble for the people
 rajasuya-yajna ke uparaant sukh-purvak indraprastha main rah rahe yudhisthir ne bina vichaar kiye; ateet main ghatit durghatnaon se bina koi shiksha liye aankh muundakar dhritarashtra kii ajna kaa paalan kiya or hastinapur ke dyutakrida-grih main aa date tathaa sarvasv gavaakar apane or apane parivaar ke apmaan kaa kaaran bane
 One of his indiscriminate acts not only deprived him of his kingdom, but also dragged Draupadi along with her Digvijay brothers on an endangered life path for 12 years of exile and 1 year of exile
 isi prakaar bharat-vibhaajan ke bhavi dushprinaamon par gambhir chintan kiye bina mahatma gandhi ke netritv main congress ne vibhaajan kii sweekruti dekar lakhon deshavaasiyon kaa dhan, sammaan or jivan sankat main daal diya
 This indiscriminate decision not only inflicted deep wounds of destruction at that time, but also created the background of future nuclear war against the country
 yadi us samay pakistan naa bana hota to naa aaj pakistan prerit aatankwaad hota, naa jammu-kashmir kii samasya hoti, naa pakistan kii dharti par baithkar china ko hamaare viruddh sangharmpurn samrik abhiyaan kriyanvit karne kaa avasar miltaa or naa yudhonmadagrast pakistani shakti bharat ke viruddh parmaanu bam bana paati
 Approval of the proposal to create Pakistan was definitely a terrible mistake of Yudhishthiri Adarsandh mentality
 yudhisthir or mahatma gandhi jaise log apni udaar or udaatt vichaar-sampada ke kaaran samaaj evam itihaas ke prishth par apni amit chhap chhodte hai
 They become venerable and revered for ages but how successful they are in demolishing egoistic peaks of injustice, oppression and oppression is difficult to say
 aisi asaadhaaran bauddhik-sampada sampann vibhootiyon ko vyapak jansamarthan to sahaj hi praapt ho jaataa he kintu satta se judi shaktiyaan inaki parvaah nahin karatin or kabhi-kabhi to apni roodhi-nirmit bediyon main jakadi hui inke virodh main khadi dikhaai detii hai
 The fact that bhishma-drona's support to the Kauravas in the Mahabharata and the British representative Lord Mountbenton's extra attachment to the late Jinnah and their interest in building Pakistan is a testimony to this fact
 shoshan or utpeedan ke drudh-durg dharm or darshan kii unnat bauddhik uplabdhiyon se nahin tuutate
 They require tremendous muscle power and extraordinary skill to collapse
 kauravon kaa vinaash bhim kii gada se or unke sahaayak karn kaa sanhaar krishna kii raajnneetik drushti se sanwalit arjuna ke gandiv se sambhav hota he
 The Golden Chapter of Salvation from the British Empire has also been written with the blood of Subhash Chandra Bose, the tactical and armed revolutionaries
 itnaa avashya he ki swatantry-itihaas ke granth-lekhan ke nimitt aavashyak prishth nirmit karne main mahatma gandhi kii mahati bhoomika rahi he 
 In the composition titled 'himalaya', Rashtrakavi Dinkar while addressing the Himalayas has written - "don't let Rok Yudhishthira go here, let him go to heaven! Let us return to gandiv-gadalauta, arjuna-bhima Veer

 in saansadon kaa kahana tha ki pashchim bengal main kanoon vyavastha charmara gai he or hairaani kii baat yah he ki khud mukhyamantri apni party hinsa ke liye bhadakaane kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 As such, Home Minister Rajnath Singh refrains from commenting on the incident in any state, but when the matter is related to the workers of his own party, then the initiative will have to be shown

 On the second day of the three-day program of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in Delhi called 'future of India: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh', Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat Sangha is speaking on the relationship of Hindutva

 The Sangh did not discover the idea of hinduism, the ancient idea of hindutva country, it has been going on before

 That's where our ancestors got the mantra of unity of existence

 Many people still call Sanatana Dharma not Hinduism
 nauveen sadi main hindu shabd hamaare granthon main aayaa
 The term Hindu came with the arrival of foreign thinkers in the lingua franca

 vyakti or samaaj paraspar ekasaath chal saktaa he
 When we say this, people say that Hindus are expressing the idea
 dharm shabd ko lekar bhi bada bhram he
 This word is found in Indian languages only
 religen kaa anuwaad dharm se karne main galatfahami hoti he
 The scriptures are not for Hindus, they are for mankind
 hamaare dharamshastra hindu shabd aane se pehle hi rache gaye
 We never considered ourselves separate from the world
 ham tabase sari vividhtaon ko lekar ek raashtra or ek samaaj ko lekar chal rahe hai
 It cannot be explained by western words

 Our Gods and Goddesses have changed since then
 hindutv kabhi khaane-pine ke vyavhaar main jakadane vaali, khaas puja, bhashaa, praant, pradesh par jor dene vaali vyavastha nahin rahi he
 Hindutva originated in India, but later spread around the world
 hindutv maanata he ki saare mat sahi hai
 The variations will be acceptable, they will be respected, because we are sons of India
 ham adharmee kaa nahin adharm kaa naash chaahate hamhindutv main khalon-dushton kaa bhi bhala hi sochaa gaya he
 We say that their wickedness is gone

 Today, this ideology is absolutely necessary
 hamen ek bhashaa, ek devi-devtaa, ek tarah kaa khanpan nahin jodate hai
 Despite these variations, we are all sons of Mother India
 hamane rajya nahin luute, jahaan bhi gaye, vahaan sabhyataa failaai

 We want to develop a balanced and coordinated development for all

 samvidhan ko maananaa sabase ahmeaadhunik loktantr main hamane samvidhan ko sweekaar kiya
 Our people have made this
 samvidhan kaa paalan karnaa sabase ahm he, yah sangh hameshaa se maanata he
 The pious and thoughtful people of our country have made a constitution

 No matter how many disputes sit and resolve the issue, think of all the interests of the country and become like a panicle provided that the interest of this culture is in the mind

 We speak on national policy, we do not speak about it in secret and get it done according to our ability
 chunki samarthyavan log nithlle nahin baith sakate hai, isliye ham vyakti nirmaan kii disha main kaam karte hai
 Women do not need to worship Goddess or maid, but women do not need to be worshiped; vah baraabar kii hissedaar he, isliye unke saath barabari kaa vyavhaar hona chahie
 We should not do this with a sense of women's salvation
 kai kshetron main mahilaayein purushon se behatar hai
 Women and men are mutually complementary

 For decades, the story of Gumnami Baba has been one of the most interesting mysteries of the country, who died in Faizabad in 1985
 is katha main yah atkal hameshaa se sansani gholti rahi ki jaldi-jaldi thikaana badalte rahane vaala yah rahasyamay shaks koi or nahin, balki netaji subhaashachandr bose hi the, jo jivan ke aakhri saal gumnami main bitaa rahe the
 On April 3, Akhilesh Yadav government gave a new life to this puzzle by sitting the inquiry committee to find out the original identity of Gumnami Baba
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne india today se is bare main kaha, ''ham insaan hai
 When we hear about a mystery, we try to investigate it
 '' haalanki mukhyamantri ne fouran yah saaf bhi kar diya ki ve to sirf hycourt ke nirdeshon kaa paalan kar rahe hai
 On 31 January 2013, the Allahabad High Court had directed the state government to display Gumnami Baba's objects in the museum and set up an inquiry commission to confirm Baba's identity
 jaanch samiti kii aghyakshata shaayad hycourt ke ek ritred jaj karenge or usamen visheshgyon kii ek team shaamil rahegi
 The decision came in response to two petitions
 pehali netaji kii bhatiji lalita bose ne 1986 main daayar kii thi or duusari bijepi netaa shakti singh ne 2010 main
 It demanded that it be ascertained who Gumnami Baba was
 phir bhi, rajya sarkaar kaa kadam jitna court ke faisle kaa sammaan karne vaala he, utana hi gahari rajnatik chaturaai bharaa bhi
 Last year, India Today exposed the Intelligence Bureau of Netaji's family for two decades
 uske baad modi sarkaar or pashchim bengal kii mamata banerjee sarkaar ne 'netaji kii filon' ko saarvajanik karne kaa kaam shuru kar diya tha
 Akhilesh Yadav government also showed impetus in this direction
 bijepi ko court ke faisle se koi rajnatik phayda uthaane se rokane ke liye uttar pradesh sarkaar ne gumnami baba kii vastuon ko ayodhya main bane sarkari 'ram katha sangrahalay' main pradarshit karne kaa faisla kiya
 When the Modi government expedited the process of making the files public, the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh ordered the formation of an inquiry committee
 videsh mantralay, grih mantralay or pradhanmantri ke karyaalay se ab tak 150 filein saarvajanik kii ja chuki hai
 But in any of these files no mention of that mysterious fakir of Faizabad has been found so far
 ise netaji par shodh kar rahe anuj dhar ne bada hi ajeeb bataaya he
 Anuj had recently met Akhilesh Yadav and requested to investigate about Gumnami Baba
 anuj kehete hai, ''saarvajanik kii gai filon main netaji se sambandhit artiai ke tahat aae prashn bhi shaamil hai
 But strangely, there is nothing in these files about this case going on in the Allahabad High Court since 1986
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai ''agar gumnami baba koi dhokheybaaj hote to netaji subhash chandra bose hone kaa daawa karte
 However, Netaji's close relatives misunderstand these speculations that Gumnami Baba was actually Netaji himself
 band daravaajon ke peechetin dashak pehle gumnami baba kii rosemara kii vastuon ko faijabad kii jila tregeri ke 'dabl lock' section main lohe kii jaaliyon ke peeche band kar diya gaya tha
 This was under the direction of the High Court in response to Lalita Bose's 1986 petition requesting to ascertain Baba's original identity and keep his belongings safe
 unki 'rosemara kii vasteen' tregeri main rakhi raheen
 He was first investigated in 1999 by the Justice Mukherjee Commission investigating the disappearance of Netaji and then recently by an expert committee appointed by the Akhilesh Yadav government in March this year to prepare a list of items
 tregeri ke adhikari tin ke in baxon ko baahar nikaalte hai, unka taala kholte hai or behad tasalli se us vyakti kaa drishy itihaas saamne laa dete hai, jo khud hameshaa gumnaam rahanaa chahta tha
 The strange thing was that the person who never allowed to take a picture of himself, that Baba had collected many photos
 inamen se kai photo netaji bose ke parijanon kii thi
 These include framed photographs of Netaji's father-mother Janakinath and Prabhavati, and also photographs of Netaji's childhood in which he is seen with his siblings

 The Justice Mukherjee Commission of Inquiry, conducting a third government inquiry within forty years, concluded in 2004 that Netaji had not died in the 1945 plane crash
 lekin ayog ne saath hi yah bhi kah diya ki is baat ko kehane ke koi pukhta sakshya nahin hai ki gumnami baba darasal khud netaji hi the
 They came to this conclusion after analysis of the stylus and DNA testing
 gumnami baba ne apane jeevankaal main kabhi yah daawa nahin kiya ki ve netaji hai, lekin unke marane ke dashakon baad tak yah daawa jor pakade hue he ki vahi darasal netaji the
 People who believe that Baba is Netaji claim that the most convincing evidence is the 2010 documentary in which Justice Mukherjee is told beyond camera, that he is 100% convinced that Baba was indeed Netaji
 gumnami baba ke peeche koi gahari antarktha he, is kayaas ko bose parivaar main unki atyadhik ruchi or netaji kii ek purv sahyogi or swatantraaa senaanee leena roy or iene ke khufia adhikari pabitra mohan roy se unke sampark se bal miltaa he
 Correspondence between them dates from the 1960s to Baba's death

 His father-in-law was a well-known homeopath who died in 1984
 unke man main is baat ko lekar kahin koi shankaa nahin thi ki baba or koi nahin balki netaji hi the
 However, Rita herself was apprehensive about this
 banerjee kahati hai, ''bhagawanji ne kabhi apana naam jaahir nahin kiya or ek baar khud ko registerd sadhu bataaya, yani vah, jiskaa naam duniya ke bahikhaate se cat chukaa he, iskaa nihitarth yah tha ki ve apni pasand se sadhu nahin bane the
 "on another occasion, Baba expressed sorrow over the fact that he had country, parents, brothers and sisters but he could not call any of them his own
" lekin duniya se sanyas lene vaale baba ko jivan main badi umdaa chijen pasand thim, aaj ke dinon ke tamaam 'baabaaon' kii hi tarah
 In addition to Rolex, he smoked expensive 555 cigarettes, reportedly had an influx of new currency notes and loved to eat mutton-keema and 'shukto' (a Bengali dish)

 This two-storied building above which hoists a saffron flag is also the residence of Guru Dutt Singh, who had been the magistrate of the district and was instrumental in installing the Ramlala statue within the disputed Babri Masjid structure in 1949

 Decades later, Shakti Singh, grandson of Guru Dutt Singh, is proud of his role in reviving the story of Baba

 They take us to the back of their house where Baba lived in a small 300 square feet room

 In 1982, a local doctor rented a room for a bald-headed bearded Baba
 shakti singh ke ye kirayedar apane din kaa sara vakt kamare ke bheetar hi bitaate the
 Very few people came to meet him and he never showed his face
 unki tej va goonjati hui aawaaj thi or ve dohari najar vaala gol chashma pahante the
 Shakti Singh says, "he always talked to us through the window and never showed his face
" ''shakti singh kaa kahana tha ki teen saal ke dauraan unhone ek baar bhi apane pita ke kirayedar kaa cheharaa nahin dekha (gumnami baba kii ek bahuprachlit tasviir darasal ek computer-janit chhavi he jo ek akhbaar ne 2001 main taiyaar kii thi)
 Shakti Singh says, "but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that establishes that Gumnami Baba was actually Netaji

 a letter written by Golwalkar on September 16, 1972, which finds it among Baba's objects, reveals another name: The Sangh chief addressed him by writing 'param Pujyapada Vijayanandji Maharaj'

 ''16 sitambar, 1985 ko baba kii mrityu ke turant baad shakti singh parivaar ne bose ke parivaar se sampark kiya
 Netaji's niece Lalita Bose came to Baba's room in Faizabad (from this room now Shakti Singh's NGO Subhash Chandra Bose operates the National Think Center)
 shakti singh kehete hai, ''unhone diwaar par netaji ke parivaar kii tasveeron ko dekha, kitabon ko dekha, dastavejon ko dekha or bistar par baithkar boleen, ve netaji subhaashachandr bose hi the
 "gumnami" Within a few weeks of Baba's death, local newspapers in Faizabad smelled the story, especially when information about Baba's bizarre personal items began to filter out
 tab 25 aktubar, 1985 ko ek sthaneey hindi akhbaar nae log kaa binar sheershak thah ''kya faijabad main gumnaam tareeke se rah rahe netaji subhaashachandr bose kii mrityu ho chuki he?'' is khabar ne media jagat main sansani failaa di or jaldi hi anya akhabaaron ne bhi maamle ko uthaa liya
 In this way a new story was born from it
 baba kaa sangrahalaub faijabad ke yahi do vivaadaaspad itihaas phir se is saal milane vaale hai
 Sometime in August this year, Akhilesh Yadav will inaugurate the museum of Gumnami Baba's objects, books, pipes and photographs in the Ram Katha Museum
 yah sangrahalay vivaadaaspad ram janmabhumi-babari masjid parisar se bamushkil ek kilometre dur sarayu nadi ke tat par do manjila kancreet imaarat main sthit he
 The structure, built at a total cost of Rs 12 crore, was completed last January

 The stones are displayed on the first floor of the museum
 gumnami baba gailaree sangrahalay ke chaar haul sankhya 4 se 7 main rahegi
 Each hall is 5,000 square feet
 bose parivaar ke zyaadaatar log is tarah ke kisi bhi kayaas ko sidhe khaarij kar dete hai ki baba ke bhes main darasal netaji hi vahaan rah rahe the
 Netaji's nephew Ardhendu Bose, a businessman in Mumbai, calls such speculations ridiculous
 ve kehete hai, ''in baba ne ek baar bhi kabhi mujhe yaa bose parivaar ke kisi bhi anya sadsy se sampark karne kii koshish nahin kii, jinamein netaji ke bhai or bhattije shaamil hai jo 1990 ke baad tak bhi jinda the

 The followers of at least three other Babas have been believing to be Netaji living in disguise of their Guru
