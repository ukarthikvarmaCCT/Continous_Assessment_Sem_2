 Two-time Deputy Chief Minister All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU) chief Sudesh Mahato has often played the role of kingmaker in bjp-led governments in Jharkhand
 rajya ke gathan ke vakt do vidhayakon vaali party ke netaa ke rup main shuruyaat karne vaale sudesh is samay 82 sadasyon vaali vidhansabha main chah vidhayakon vaali party ke mukhiya hai
 This is a decent number in the state, but Sudesh considers it appropriate to sit in the opposition
 rajya kii raajnneeti main ulatpher ke daur main ve ekmaatr netaa hai jinhone jeemem ke netritv vaali sarkaron main shaamil hone kii bajaae vipaksh main baithne kaa faisla kiya he
 He faces many challenges before the assembly elections, as his party could not win a single seat in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin sudesh ko vidhansabha chunaav main vaapasi kaa puraa bharosa he
 He spoke to Amitabh Srivastava, assistant editor of India Today
 pesh hai mukhya anshahapaki party ke liye loksabhaa kaa chunaav acha nahin rahaa
 How do you see the results? It was a Lok Sabha election
 isamen logon ne mukhya rup se centre main sarkaar badalane ke liye vot diya
 People were very angry with the UPA government
 iske kai kaaran the, jaise mahangaai, berogari, bhrashtachar
 So people voted for NDA
 ageesu ne kshetreey party ke taur par is chunaav main tagdi chunauti di thi
 We did well in several major constituencies
 yuvaaon or mahilaon ne badi sankhya main hamen vot diya
 This election also helped us put forward the objectives of the party
 loksabhaa chunaavon se kya sabak siikhaa?sabak bilkul saaf hai
 People want their basic needs taken care of
 sarkaar koi rigelt de
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi was completely successful in cashing the dissatisfaction of the people in his favor
 mahangaai par niyantran, yuvaaon main skill kaa vikaas or rojgaar, bhrashtachar par lagaam or desh ko tej vikaas ke raste par dobaaraa lautaanaa, aise kai achche-khaase vaade kar ke unhone aisa kar dikhaaya
 i have congratulated Modi ji's government and hope that he will try to fulfill his promises
 kya ageesu vidhansabha chunaavon main vaapasi karegi?ageesu vidhansabha chunaavon main nishchit rup se acha pradarshan karegi
 These elections will be fought on local issues
 aam chunaavon ke vipareet log hamen rajya main majboot vikalp ke rup main dekh rahe hai
 Our demand for state's special status is in the minds of the people
 hamaara rukh spasht he
 We believe that the people here have the right over the land and its resources
 logon ko jameen se hone vaale laabh kaa baraabar hissaa milanaa chahie
 What is your party's agenda for Jharkhand? Since its formation, the state has been in the news for the wrong reasons
 ham iske bare main logon kii dharna or vaastaviktaa donon badalanaa chaahate hai
 There are immense possibilities of development here
 sthaayee sarkaar or eemaandaar koshishon se ageesu ise sthaayee vikaas ke path par laana chaahati he
 Instead of being a mere mineral-rich state, it can become a producer of electricity and steel goods etc
 It can move forward on our economic agenda
 udyog, buniyadi dhaancha or krishi main avasar kaa nirmaan karke or yuvaaon ko shikshit or kushal banaakar ham unhen rojgaar de sakate hai
 What role will AJSU play in future state politics? AJSU was created for the creation of Jharkhand
 lambey sangharsh ke baad hamane 2000 main yah lakshya paaya
 But it still yearns for a strong government
 pradesh ke votaron ke liye hamaara sandesh saaf haih aap pichley 14 varshon main har tarah kii sarkaar dekh chuke hai
 Give us only one year
 ham dikhaaenge ki acchhee sarkaar kaise chalaai jaati he
 i assure that the youth will get good education and honorable employment
 striyon ko rojgaar or suraksha milegi
 The poor will get health and other facilities
 sirf ek varsh main hi fark dikhne lagegaa
 You have been demanding special state status for Jharkhand
 aapako lagata he ki is tarah kaa mudda votaron ko prabhavit karegaa?hamane vot keliye vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang nahin kii he
 We consider it our right
 yah maang janata ke adhikaron se sidhe judi he
 We have rights over land, water, forests and minerals
 ye adhikaar hamen roji-roti muhaiyaa karaayenge
 Our escape will stop
 sadak, bijli, peyajal, skool or aspataal jaisi buniyadi suvidhaayen milengi
 i am known as AJSU youth party
 lekin loksabhaa chunaavon main badi sankhya main yuvaaon ne bijepi ko vot diya he
 How will you bring them back? The youth of Jharkhand have always been with us
 jaisaa ki maine pehle bataaya ki vidhansabha chunaav rajya ke muddon par ladaa jayega
 The youth of the state know that only AJSU thinks of inclusive development of them and all sections
 ve hamen hi apana janadesh denge
 Jharkhand is a Naxalite affected state
 aap unhen mukhya dhara main kaise waapas laaenge?rajya ke vikaas ke liye shanti pehali shart he
 We have lost many good leaders and activists in Naxalite violence
 vaastavik vikaas ke jariye ham ek bade varg ke bheetar vyaapt anyaay or shoshan kii bhaavana dur karenge
 Our party will talk to misguided youth
 ham unke punarvaas kii jarurat ko samajhate hai

 Students are upset to the extent that they will be forced to commit suicide
 grajuation paanch saal or piji chaar saal main hoga to chaatr naukari paane ke liye kahaan jaaenge
 a date has been given by the university, but still the date has not been determined from when to when the examination will be done

 ’’ Kapil Sharma's show recently got surprise
 is par gutthi kii vaapasi ho gai thi
 Everyone is shocked at this
 vaise kya aapako gutthi kii vaapasi kii asli vajah pataa he
 
 
 Gutthi's character was very popular on the channel on which Kapil Sharma's comedy show first appeared
 sunil grover ise nibhaate the or isi ne unako popularity bhi dilaai
 But when Kapil returned to the other channel after 'the Kapil Sharma Show' on the other channel, his team came together but Guthi was left behind
 lekin haal hi ke kapil sharma ke sho main darshakon ko ek sarprise mila
 Because the knot had returned
 ab aap soch rahe honge ki aakhir 'da kapil sharma sho' ke peeche gutthi ke aane kii gutthi kya he
 
 
 Know what the relationship is in 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' and Salman Khan
 
 
 to jaan len gutthi lauti thi apane pyaar or pati ke liye
 The idea is that in this episode of 'the Kapil Sharma Show', Ranbir Kapoor came for the promotion of his film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' coming on Diwali
 ab pehle vaale sho main to ham ye dekh hi chuke hai ki gutthi kis kadar ranbir par fida thi or unako date bhi kar chuki thi or unka baccha bhi hone vaala tha
 However, Vahanbir Sethin came to divorce in the episode

 In a fun filled environment, Gutthi also went on to sing a wonderful song for Sidhu, which you can imagine how fun it would have been
 haalanki gutthi riterns vaale'da kapil sharma sho'ke is apisod main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya ki ve kahin kisi kanoonee ke cese main na funs jaaen
 Hence Gutthi was not named even once during the episode

 The Senate has confirmed Srinivasan's appointment
 unki niyukti ke paksh main 97 vot pade
 After this confirmation, Srinivasan, 46, became the first indian-american judge of the Upper Court
 america raashtrapati baraak obama ne 11 june, 2012 ko unhen pehali baar namankit kiya tha
 However, his nomination returned to the President on January 2, 2013, as the Senate adjourned sine die
 iske baad 3 janvari, 2013 ko obama ne unhen usee karyaalay main dobaaraa namankit kar diya tha
 The comments baraak obama ne shrinivasana kii tarif main kaside padhate hue kaha ki vah america kii sheersh duusari adaalat main 'vishistataa ke saath' nyaayadhish kaa pad sanbhaalenge
 The 46-year-old Srinivasan is the first South Asian to be appointed to a top US court
 obama ne ek bayaan main kaha ki shrinivasana maardarshak ke samaan hai
 He will now serve the Federal Bench with distinction
 bharat ke chandigarh main janme or larens, consaas main paley-bade shrinivasana ne america ke principal dipti solisitor general banane se pehle kareeb do dashak tak behtareen litgator (vaadi) ke taur par kaam kiya
 He was first nominated by US President Barack Obama on June 11, 2012

 duniya kii sabase zyada aabaadi vaale mulk china main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf koi dhilaai nahin barti ja rahi he, jiske chalate bhrashtachariyon ke hausale post hue hai
 There, action is taken as soon as corruption cases come up and people involved in corruption do not get a chance to flee the country
 yahi vajah he ki pichley kuch saalon main china main bhrashtachar kaaphi had tak kam bhi hua he
 After Nirav Modi, a case of fraud in an insurance company came up in China, then the government there immediately swung into action and took big action
 chini akhbaar global times ke mutabik china main bhrashtachar kaa maamla saamne aane ke baad anbang insurance group ke purv CEO vyuu shiyohui ko aaropee banaaya gaya he
 In addition, China Insurance Regulatory Commission is also going to take over the business of the group completely for a year
 isse aropiyon ke paisa videsh bhejne or bhaagane ke raste bhi band ho jaaenge or aaropee ke liye sajaa se bachanaa bhi sambhav nahin he
 While the accused like Nirav Modi and Mehuch Choksi escape after executing a scam of about Rs 11
5 billion in India, it is not easy for the accused in China to escape
 vahaan bhrashtachar ke maamle main funsane ke baad sidhe jail bhej diya jaataa he
 Due to the vigilance and strictness of the Chinese government, it is not possible for the accused to escape punishment in the corruption case
 yah kaaran he ki haal ke dinon main china ne bhrashtachar ke maamle main karrwai karke is par kaaphi had tak kaabo bhi paaya he
 At the same time, corrupt miscreants like Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi and then Nirav Modi in India commit scams and go abroad
 dilachasp baat yah he ki bharat main bhrashtachar ko lekar sarkarein bhi badal gayi, lekin yahaan par karrwai ke naam par sirf dikhaava hota he
 Because of this, the corruption is very high
 saal 2012 main china kii satta sanbhaalane ke baad raashtrapati shi jinping ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf vyapak str par abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 He adopted a policy of zero tolerance against corruption
 pichley chah saalon main unki sarkaar ne bhrashtachar main shaamil rahe kai adhikariyon or netaaon ko jail bheja
 Most of these officials are still in the air in China jail
 isse pehle china main bhrashtachar kaaphi zyada tha, lekin shi jinping kii sakhti ke baad se isamen kaaphi kami ai he
 China's ranking has also improved in the corruption index
 bhartiya vaigyanik ke netritv vaale ek nae shodh main paaya gaya he ki akashganga ke vrihad blueole main 60 lakh saal pehle gas kaa ek gubaar samaa gaya tha or phir lakhon suryo ke vajan vaala ek bada bulbula baahar nikalakar aayaa tha
 Rongaman Bordoloi and his team of researchers at MIT, Cambridge, found with the help of nasa's Hubble spacetelloscope that many remote quasars could be seen from the northern half of the Fermi bubbles, the gases emanating from the deep black holes of the galaxy
 habbal spes telescope ne kwasar kii roshni kaa pareekshan kiya taaki gas kii gati se judi jaankaree praapt kii ja sake or yah pataa lagaaya ja sake ki gas prithvi ke paas aa rahi he yaa dur ja rahi he
 Based on the speed of the substance, the research team assessed that these bubbles formed from an energetic event formed about 60 to 90 million years ago
 bordoloi ne kaha, ek insaani jivan main 60 se 90 lakh saal ek badi avadhi lag sakati he lekin yadi antarikshawya samyavadhi ke taur par dekhen to yah palak jhapakane jaisaa he
 To give an idea of this scale, let me tell you that the universe is about 13
 7 arab saal purana he or dianasor lagbhag 6
 6 million years ago
 to akashganga ke vrihad blike hole main jo antim grass gaya tha, wo dianasoron ke vilupt hone ke baad gaya tha
 He said, we have for the first time detected the movement of cold gas in one of these bubbles
 isse ham gas ke veg ko aank sake or yah gananaa kar sake ki bulabulon kaa nirmaan kab hua
 "it was a very powerful and energetic event," Bordoloi said
 shaayad aisa hota ho ki gas kaa ek gubaar blike hole main jaataa ho, jisase padaarth footkar nikalataa ho or garm gas ke dohare ansh ban jate ho
 These were seen under X-ray and gamma-ray observations
 uske baad se hi blike hole chijen nigal rahaa he
 a black hole is a compact and solid region of space, which consists of a gravitational field
 yegurutviya kshetra itnaa teevr hota heki koi bhi padaarth yaa prakaash bachakar nikal nahin saktaa
 The massive black hole at the center of our planetarium has compressed the mass of 4
5 million stars like the Sun into a very small area of space
 jab bordoloi se poocha gaya ki blueole kaa aglaa grass kab usamen jayega, to unhone pitiai se kaha, haal hi main ek dwitara ji2 prithvi ke kai guna dravyaman vaala akaash ganga ke centre main sthit vrihad blike hole main girane ke behad kareeb aa gaya tha
 But somehow he survived and did not fall
 unhone kaha, taramandal ke andar or baahar hone vaale gas pravaah kaa adhyayan karke ham akaash ganga ke bhavishya kaa adhyayan kar sakate hai
 We can begin to predict whether it will continue to create new stars? Or it will exhaust the gas supply in it and it will become an old and dead planetarium
 is samay har saal akashganga main kisi bhi nae taare kaa janm na ke baraabar he
 With regard to the upcoming challenges, he said, a big challenge before us is to actually see what theoretical predictions can be used to explain the observations being made here
 unhone kaha, ham is kshetra main nae habbal nirikshan kar rahe hai or ummid he ki inamen kai nae chaunkaane vaale nattejey nikalakar aaenge

 It stars Manoj Bajpayee, Richa Chaddha, Mrinal Thakur, Rajkumar Rao and Freida Pinto in pivotal roles
 sensor board ne film se sabhi english or hindi main maujuud apshabd or gaali hataane kaa aadesh diya he
 CBFC has also run the scars on many scenes of sexual abuse in the film
 pehlaaj nihlani ke CBFC pad chhodane ke baad bhi filmon par cat lagane kaa silsilaa rukaa nahin he
 After Prasun Joshi became CBFC President, it was felt that now the film makers will get some relief
 lekin maujuuda halaat ko dekhte hue lagata he yah silsilaa abhi jari rahegaa

 tabiyat kharaab thi, lekin is baar ve sanyamit the, udaar the or aatmavishvaas se labarej the
 Kejriwal was in full action
 yahi vajah he ki unhen pehle hi bhaashan main dilli kii janata ke saamne 7 kasame khain
 Ramlila Maidan was a witness to the Janlokpal movement

 Even in his first speech after the oath, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was seen attached to the ground
 unhone janata ke baari samarthan ko kudarat kaa karishma bataaya
 Kejriwal told that at one time he was also in vanity
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main mili karaari haar se unka ahankaar chakanachur ho gaya
 CM showed a big heart, Kejriwal also remembered his opponents
 unhone kaha ki ab koi virdohi nahin he

 He made it clear that if someone commits hooliganism by wearing a cap, he should not be spared
 2013 ke jaisaa hi is baar bhi saadagi ke saath shapath-grahan kaa kaarykram hua
 Kejriwal then made several promises to Delhi

 Kejriwal also showed some new dreams, but many things remained common in both the oaths
 13 maheene pehle ramlila ke manch se kejariwal ne dilliwaalon ko sting karne kii naseehat di thi
 This time also suggested something similar

 To fulfill the same promise, he rode the metro train before his swearing in
 haalanki is baar unhone aisa nahin kiya or aam aadmi kii tarah gaadi main ramlila maidan pahunche
 Compared to the previous time, this time Kejriwal spoke in a snazzy manner
 vaadon kii jhadi lagane kii bajaay is baar ve use puraa karne par jor dete najar aae
 He also clarified on the last bungalow dispute and requested the media
 2013 main siem bane, to kejariwal ne virdohi partiyon par hamalaa kiya tha
 But this time he also talked about taking political restraint and cooperation with congress-bjp for development

 Kejriwal held a meeting with all the ministers in his office
 tabiyat kharaab hone kii vajah se baithak zyada lambii nahin chali
 The responsibility of development on Team Kejriwal is now the promise and intention of Kejriwal, who won 67 seats in Bumper
 isaki jhalak shapath ke baad pehle bhaashan se mil bhi chuki he
 Now the expectations are from Kejriwal and his new team, who add, subtract, multiply the promises and implement them

 Know where he is right now? Rahul Gandhi went on a 15-day holiday on February 20, after which he extended his leave several times, although during this time the party leader was in political trouble
 At this time, the instincts were seen defending their decision to go on several levels
 congress netritv lagaataar yah kahata rahaa ki unke number do netaa ko aatmvishleshan karne or party main unka role tay karne or party ke bhavishya par vichaar karne ke liye thodaa samay chahie
 It is expected that Rahul Gandhi will address a farmers rally against the Land Acquisition Bill on Sunday, 19 April
 congresis bill kaa lagaataar virodh karti rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi's image has emerged as a sympathy for the farmers and it is believed that this provision in the Land Acquisition Act of 2013 could be brought only because of the fact that their land cannot be acquired without the will of the farmers

 The 34-day-old Fadnavis government is to be expanded on Friday

 We hope that something will happen
 ab koun he shraadh kaa kauwa?yaad rahe ki maharashtra chunaav se pehle bijepi or shivasena kaa purana gathbandhan tut gaya tha
 During the election campaign, Shiv Sena used strong words like 'crows of Shraddha' for BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhi chunaav prachaar ke dauraan shivasena ko 'haftavsuli party' or ensipi ko 'nachurli karpt party' kaha tha
 But the Fadnavis government in the House won the 'disputed' trust vote with the support of the NCP
 isvishwaas mat ko shivasena ne 'farji' bataaya thaor rajyapal kii gaadi ke aage khub hangaamaa bhi kiya tha
 But after a few 'high-level' meetings between the two parties, everything is being said right between the BJP and the Shiv Sena
 yah sambhavat: pehali baar he ki kisi rajya kaa pramukh vipakshi dal sidhe-sidhe sarkaar main shaamil hone ja rahaa he
 Shiv Sena will not get big portfolios like Home, Housing, Revenue and Energy
 inaki jagah use jal sangrakshan, udyog or peedblyoody jaise vibhaag die ja sakate hai
 The Shiv Sena wanted the Home Department, but could get the post of Minister of State for Home

 In the case of encroachment around the Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai, the Haji Ali Dargah Trust has approached the Supreme Court to amend the order to remove the mosque
 trust ne supreme court main arji daakhil kar kaha he ki maharashtra sarkaar ke saamne atikaraman hataane ke maamle main kinaaraa masjid shaamil nahin thi kyonki vah sarkari jameen par nahin he
 The issue of regularizing the Kinara Mosque is under consideration with the state government committee, so the mosque is kept out of the purview of sabotage and the committee is directed to settle the matter within four weeks
 isse pehle supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar se kaha tha ki court ke aadesh ke mutabik ilaake se atikaraman hataaya jaae
 The court told the government that we had said the same thing earlier but it seems that you do not want to follow the court's order
 aapako ilaake se atikaraman hataanaa hi hoga
 Nobody enjoys any legal protection in the area
 darasal maharashtra sarkaar ne supreme court main daleel di ki ilaake main atikaraman hataane kii karrwai ke dauraan kanoon vyavastha ke bigadane kii ashanka he
 Because in this area there is also the Kinara Mosque
 teen july ko supreme court ne maharashtra sarkaar ko do hafte main dargah ke aasapaas 908 varg meter ilaake main atikaraman ko hataane ke aadesh die the
 The court said that if the order is not followed, there will be serious consequences
 maharashtra sarkaar se kaha tha ki dargah ke aasapaas saundaryikaran karnaa jaruri he
 After the High Court order, now the Supreme Court has also issued orders, then you have to do it
 isse pehle dargah trust ne atikaraman hataaya tha lekin abhi bhi ilaake main atikaraman bachaa he
 Now that the Dargah has expressed its inability to remove it, the Supreme Court has issued this order
 mumbai kii haji ali dargah ke ilaake main atikaraman ke maamle main supreme court ne biemasi se kaha tha ki haji ali dargah kaa saundaryikaran hona hi chahie
 Either approve or amend the beautification plan given by BMC Dargah Trust or tell your own plan
 court ne kaha tha ki 30 june tak biemasi plan supreme court main daakhil kare
 The court appreciated the move to remove the encroachment of the Dargah Trust
 court ne trust se kaha he ki chaar hafte main baaki atikaraman bhi hataae
 The Dargah Trust has submitted a beautification scheme to the court
 isse pehle sunwaayee main court ne kaha tha ki dargah ke paas 737 varg meter ilaake main atikaraman hatenge or dargah trust khud hi atikaraman hataayega
 The Supreme Court allowed the dargah trust to remove encroachments on its own
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki dargah trust 8 may tak khud hi hataae atikaraman
 However, the court said that the mosque, built in 171 square meters, will not be ransacked
 supreme court ne hoicourt ke aadesh par todphod ke liye bani special task force kii todphod kii karrwai par roak laga di thi
 The Supreme Court had given the green signal to the Trust to plan for the beautification and enhancement of facilities of Haji Ali
 supreme court ne aadesh diya he ki is mudde par koi bhi court koi aadesh jari nahin karegaa
 If any party has problems then it can come to the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne hoicourt main pakshakaron ko notice jari kiya tha
 The comments darasal 22 march 2017 ko bambai hoicourt ne yahaan 908 varg meter ilaake main atikaraman hataane ke aadesh die the
 The Haji Ali Dargah Trust challenged in the Supreme Court
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court main sijeai jees khehar kii bench ne kaha ki vah 908 meter main se 171 varg meter ilaaka jisamen masjid he, par todphod se roak laga denge
 But the trust must ensure that it will help the authority to remove the remaining encroachments
 masjid ko lekar vah baad main sunwaayee karegaa
 The Supreme Court has said that Haji Ali has a lot of encroachment and it is just shops
 logon ko dargah tak pahunchane main dikkat hoti he
 The court said that people of religion should support the action to remove encroachment
 dargah trust kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki hoicourt kaa aadesh sahi nahin he
 This mosque is very old and has been with him since 1931
 hoicourt ke ilaake main todphod ke aadesh par roak lagaai jaani chahie
 The trust has filed an application in the Supreme Court, saying that the Kinara Mosque was not involved in the removal of encroachment before the Maharashtra government as it is not on government land
 kinaaraa masjid ko niyamit karne kaa mudda rajya sarkaar kii cameti ke paas vichaaradhin he isliye masjid ko todphod ke daayre se baahar rakhaa jaae or cameti ko maamle ko chaar hafte ke bheetar nipataara karne kaa nirdesh diya jaae
 Earlier, the Supreme Court had asked the Maharashtra government to remove encroachment from the area as per the court's order

 sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ke bare main usase sawaal poochne kii aazaadee loktantr kii kasuti he
 The Right to Information (RTI) Act passed in 2005 gives citizens of India the right to ask questions to their government
 isaki badaulat log apane sarkari kartadhartaaon ko javabdeh tehraane ke liye keval chunaavon par hi nirbhar nahin rah gaye hai
 60 lakh information requests are filed every year across the country
 ye artiai kanoon ko duniya bhar ke paardarshita kanoonon main sabase zyada istemaal kiya jane vaala kanoon bana detii hai
 National assessments have shown that a large proportion of these applications are filed by the poorest and the most poor
 aisa shaayad isliye he kyonki ve artiai kanoon kii is jabardast kshamta ko samajhate hai ki yah unhen apane buniyadi adhikaron or paatrata ko hasil karne kii takat detaa he, khaskar tab jab sevaaon ke milane main naakaami ko durust karne kaa koi asardaar shikaayat nivaaran tantra maujuud nahin he
 For example, when the slum dwellers in Delhi did not get subsidized cheap rations of their share and made the excuse that the government had not supplied food grains to ration shops, they used the RTI law and Acquired monthly stock registers of their shops
 in dastavejon se saarvajanik vitaran pranali main andhadhundh bhrashtachar kaa pardaafash hua or logon ne rashan kaa samuchit vitaran sunishchit karne main adhikariyon ko javabdeh tehraane ke liye inkaa kaamyaab istemaal kiya
 Similarly, people have used this law to ensure the rendering of minimum wages, pension, healthcare, education, water supply and sanitation
 artiai kanoon ne loktantric dhaanche main satta ke bantwaare tathaa nagarikon or sarkaar ke bich rishte kii kayapalat ke behad jaruri kaam kii shuruyaat kii he
 People are using this law to question the functioning of the highest ranks of the country, their decisions and even their conduct
 pradhanmantri kii shaikshik yogyata or unki videsh yatraaon par hue kharchon kii jaankaree maangi gai he, to supreme court ke jajon kii sampatti or saarvajanik kshetron ke bainkon kaa karj nahin chukaane vaali companiyon ke naamon kii jaankaree bhi hasil kii gai he
 This transparency law has proved to be helpful in exposing big stigma stories of corruption like Vyapam scam and Adarsh scam
 maanavadhikaar kii jyadatiyon par sawaal uthaae gaye hai jinamein police muthbhedon main hui maut or gumshudagiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 Recently, the information obtained through the RTI Act was used to unleash the false claims of government actors
 jab pradhanmantri or maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri ne aadhaar kii badaulat hajaaron karodon rupye kii bachat kaa daawa kiya—kaha gaya ki aadhaar kii vajah se 4 karod jaali rashan card or vishvavidhyalayon ke 80,000 farji shikshakon kaa pataa lagaaya gaya he—to unke daavon par sawaal puche gaye
 The government failed to produce evidence and acted to compensate for the loss and issued explanations and even improved the proceedings of the Parliament
 isi tarah notebandi kii shandaar kamyaabi ke daawey artiai kaa istemaal karne waalon kii poochtacha ke aage tik nahin sake
 The power of the power can also be gauged from the power of the RTI Act that under this, the institutions have unified themselves to protect themselves from investigation
 supreme court ne march 2010 main khud apane saamne apil pesh kii or dilli hycourt ke us faisle ko chunauti di, jisamen usne ek artiai arji ke jawaab main supreme court ke jajon kii sampatti se judi jaankaree ujagar karne ke liye kaha tha
 The matter is still pending! The RTI Act gave every citizen of the country the right to see government files and records
 3 arab sambhavit vislabloar or auditor kii fouj khadi kar di he
 Traditionally, this role was only played by the government functionaries
 phir tajjub kya ki jinhone satta ko sach dikhaane ke liye is kanoon kaa istemaal kiya, unhen aksar isaki keemat bhi chukaani padi he
 By resorting to this law to expose corruption and abuse of power, many citizens across the country have been threatened, attacked and at least 71 people have been murdered
 assam main artiai ke jariye saarvajanik vitaran pranali main bhrashtachar ko ujagar karne vaale nandi singh ko berahami se maar daalaa gaya
 In October 2016, Bhupendra Veera was shot in his house in Mumbai as he had obtained information to lodge a complaint of complicity of the powerful land mafia
 ye hamale is kanoon kaa istemaal karne waalon ko sabak sikhaane tak simit nahin hai
 This law has also not been spared
 is kanoon ko ek ke baad ek sarkaron ne nicha dikhaane kii kai koshishen kin
 The first such attempt took place within a year of its implementation
 sarkaar chaahati thi ki file par likhi tippaniyon ko is kanoon ke daayre se baahar kar diya jaae taaki logon ko faisle lene kii prakriya se judi jaankariyon tak pahunchane se roka ja sake
 In 2013, when six national political parties were declared public entities under the RTI Act, they came together in a rare unity demonstration and proposed an amendment in Parliament to exempt themselves from accountability under this law
 She brought
 soochna ke adhikaar ko dhata bataane kii haalia koshish sarkaar kaa vah kadam he jisamen usne artiai main sanshodhan kaa ek vidheyak pesh karne ke liye chori-chhipe fehrist main darj kiya he
 He put the principle of extensive discussion on hold before enacting the law
 is prastaavit sanshodhan ke jariye sarkaar soochna ayuktaon kii swaittata kii jaden khodakar soochna hasil karne kii logon kii takat par centre kaa shikanja kasnaa chaahati he
 The RTI Act has stipulated that Information Commissioners can remain in office till they retire at the age of five or 65 years
 pradhan soochna ayukta or kendriya soochna ayuktaon kii tankhwaahen bhi supreme court ke jajon ke baraabar hai or sansad se tay kii gai hai
 The RTI Act has given this fixed tenure and higher status to the Information Commissioners, only to make them so powerful that they can carry out their work with full autonomy and give the highest ranking person of this law
 To instruct them to follow
 ratiai sanshodhan vidheyak 2018 desh main soochna ayuktaon kaa kaarykaal or tankhwaah tay karne kii takat centre sarkaar ke haathon main saunpna chahta he
 This will make the Information Commission function like a government department and it is likely that it will make the commissioners obedient to the central government, in the sense that their tenure and salary is not adversely affected
 ye prastaavit sanshodhan kendriya soochna ayog (siisi) main khaali padon ko bharne main bhaajapa sarkaar kii ziddee niskriyata kii prishthbhumi main aae hai
 Not a single commissioner has been appointed in the CIC since May 2014 and people have been left to knock on the doors of the courts
 ayukta ke kul 11 sweekrut padon main se chaar khaali hai
 Four more posts including the Chief Information Commissioner will be vacated this year
 niyuktiyaan nahin hone se apilon or shikayaton kaa ambara lag gaya he, natijatan, ayog ke kaamkaaj main bahut zyada deree ho rahi he
 This has made this law redundant for the people
 yah artiai kanoon kii takat or praasangikta kaa hi saboot he ki logon ne ise kamjor karne kii koshishon se lagaataar isaki hifaazat kii he
 Every step of the reshuffle in this law has faced tremendous resistance from the people - people from all walks of life have come forward to protect RTI
 is baar bhi artiai sanshodhan vidheyak ke khilaaf logon ke virodh ne sarkaar ko sansad main ise pesh karne kii taarikh ko kam se kam multavee karne ko majaboor kar diya
 Any government serious about fighting corruption and giving good governance should strengthen the RTI system
 artiai kanoon logon ko bhrashtachar or satta ke durupyog ko ujagar karne kaa vikendrikrut dhaancha muhaiyaa karata he
 Further, further links need to be prepared — an effective anti-corruption and grievance redressal framework should be created, so that the experience achieved through the use of the RTI Act can be turned into an act of deterrence against those responsible
 vidambnaa ki is dhaanche ke ahm hisse—lokapal kanoon or vislabloar suraksha kanoon—paarit hone ke chaar saal baad bhi amal kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The Grievance Redressal Bill, introduced with the objective of establishing a time-bound mechanism to investigate complaints of rendering of the service, came to an end with the dissolution of the previous Lok Sabha and no attempt to bring it back has been made yet
 aankade or kahe-sune saboot bataate hai ki duniya main soochna paane kaa sabase pragatisheel vidhaan maane jane vaale artiai kanoon ne sarkari kaamkaaj main paardarshita or javabdehi laane kii prakriya kamyaabi ke saath shuru kii he
 But when the effective framework of accountability is governed, only then we, the people of India, will be able to get the systematic and permanent benefits of our transparency law

 The RTI activist, who pretended his own death to marry a girlfriend, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the District Court while his girlfriend has been sentenced to 2 years
 aaropee pehle se hi shaadishuda tha, usne ek veikshipt vyakti kii hatya kar use apni car main jala diya tha, or apni maut kaa swang rachaa tha

 kisaan bahut kuch paisa kar rahaa he lekin maang bade to munafa badhegaa or laagat or ghategi
 ' kisaanon ko karz ke chakravyuuh se baahar nikaalnaa or munaafe kii kheti karana itnaa aasaan nahin tha or garibi kii jang se ladane main kuch udhyamiyon ne saath diya he jo is badlaav ko vyapak bana rahe hai jahaan kheton main ugi unki fasal or graahak ke bich kii kadiyaan judati hai
 Jyoti Awasthi, who markets organic products along Delhi's Ghaziabad and Malcha Marg, has come a long way in the last nearly two years
 satat argenic naam se unki pahal rang laa rahi he
 She has today joined dozens of peasant families in western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bundelkhand
 avasthi kahati hai ki vah kisaanon ko utsahit karne kii zarurat thi or iske liye pehali chiz unhen us fasal ke sahi daam chaiye jo vah uga rahe hai
 “we have been working with the urban poor for a long time
 hamane ye dekha ki bahut saare log shaharon main aa to gayi hai lekin waapas gaanv janaa chaahate hai
 These people are from peasant families
 hamane in ilaakon main jaakar kisaanon ko jaivik kheti karne ko protsaahit kiya or unke utpaada us ilaake ke retail bhav main kharidne shuru kiye
 We told the farmers that if you work hard then fix the common price
 isse kisaanon main utsaah paidaa hua
 " is tarah se kharide gayi jaivik fal or sabziyon kii keemat bazaar aate aate saamaanya utpaadon ke mukaable 30 se 40 pratishat adhik hoti he
 This is the challenge for entrepreneurs like Jyoti
 “shuruyaat main hamane ghaataa khaakar ye kaam shuru kiya lekin hamen ummid he ki kisaanon or graahakon main jaagrukta badhegi to ye sabake liye vin-vin vaali sichuation hogi
 ”says Jyoti Awasthi, director of Sustain
 aise udhyamiyon kii ab ek kadi ban rahi he
 Take, for example, 38-year-old Ganesh Chaudhary, whose business of organic products is expanding from Katni in Madhya Pradesh to Hyderabad in the south
 peshey se ejeeniyar rahe choudhary ‘aarogy sukh’ ke sansthaapak or saajhedaar hai or beeing desi ke naam se kai jaivik utpaada banaate hai
 Desi cow is among their products
 vah kehete hai ki in dinon gaay ke naam par utpaat machaa rahe logon ko gaay kii asal ahmiyat pataa nahin he ki vah kitne phaayde de sakati he
 Chaudhary has also brought together several farmer families
 vah kehete hai, “pehle main sochataa tha ki main akelaa ye kaam kar saktaa hum lekin kaam faisla gaya or ab khushi he ki kai pariwaron ko main apane saath jod rahaa hum
 Many of my hands seem to have moved
 ” These stories are important because they are coming from the areas where there is often disappointing news on the situation of the farmers
 kahin-kahin hi sahi ummid kii kiran dikh rahi he
 Meet 25-year-old Bhavesh Wankhede Patil
 mumbai ke tata insttitute of soshal science (TISS) se padhai karne ke baad aaj wo vidarbha ke maayoos kisaanon main josh bhar rahe hai
 Bhavesh tells us that among all the families where farmers committed suicide, many of them want to join their campaign of organic farming
 bhavesh kehete hai jab unke pita ko dil kaa daura padaa to unhen rasinic kheti ke kuprabhavon ko samajhane kaa mauka mila
 He came to know that on the one hand poison is reaching the customers' body, while the farmer is cultivating losses and getting stuck in debt
 “hamane donon ore kii samasyaon ko ek saath rakhkar dekha or tay kiya ki kisaanon ko sasteneble agriculture kii ore le janaa hoga
 We teach the farmer how he can reduce the cost of his farming
 ham unhen sikhaate hai ki gaay kaa gobar, gomutra or pattiyaan or west kaa istemaal kar khaad kaise banaai jaati he
 ”bhavesh set up a network to provide technical advice to farmers along with things
 vah daawa karte hai ki aaj ek hazaar se adhik kisaan unke saath jude hai
 Organic farming is reducing costs for Vidarbha farmers, burdened with debt
 aaj jab desh main kuch log gauraksha ke naam par utpaat machaa rahe hon or dharmik jajbaton ko bhadakaane kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he to ye kisaan or udhyami gaay kii aarthik upyogita or guseva kaa nayaa rasta dikhaa rahe hai
 Dharmendra Sirohi and his father make manure and nutrients at home from cow dung and cow urine which is sufficient for their cultivation and in Bundelkhand, Kamlesh and his colleagues have also reduced the cost of farming by using organic manure and now they are zero Budgets are moving towards farming
 2015 main sarkaar kii apni report ke hisaab se jaivik utpaadon kaa bazaar 25 se 30 pratishat salanaa kii dar se bad rahaa he or ek anumaan ke mutabik agle kuch saalon main 9000 karod rupee kaa hoga
 In the organic products business, it is a tough challenge to build the credibility of your product in the market with small entrepreneurs and farmers
 jahaan satat kii avasthi kahati hai ki wo prayogshaalaon se certificate hasil kar apane cells centaron main graahakon kii santushti ke liye rakhti hai
 At the same time, Ganesh says that certification is necessary but the real seal is the satisfaction of the customer
 “agar graahak ko phayda hoga to vah zarur hamaare utpaada kharidega
 "says Ganesh
 lekin chote udhyamiyon ko pataa he ki unka muqabla badi badi companiyon se he jinke paas rasinic kheti ke utpaada bechney ke liye paise or vigyapanon kii kami nahin he
 In such a situation, people like Nivedita Varshney have a special role to add these links
 nivedita kahati hai ki vah kisaanon, udhyamiyon or kharidaaron ke network ko jodne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The comments vah bataati hai, “jab kisaan chemical forming se organic farming kii ore aata he to mitti se zahreele chemicals ko hatane main kai saal lagate hai
 Usually it is three years
 ham is period ko kanvarjan period kehete hai or certification bhi under kanvarjan ke naam se hota he or isi jaankaree ke saath utpaada bechaa jaataa he
 At this time, the farmer needs a big support so that his produce is sold in the market and someone will help him to meet his deficit
 aise main kai udhyami, sarkari or gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kisaan kii madad kar rahe hai
 This is quite important
 VIDEO- jaivik kheti ne badal di kisaanon kii kismat If you look closely, you will know that the relation of air going into your lungs is also related to what you are eating because the use of chemicals and chemical fertilizers also dissolve a lot of poison in the air
 jaivik kheti ko lekar hamane ye kahaniyaan badlaav or ummid kii ek jhalak bhar hai
 Farmers are still worried and they have to go a long way on the road to prosperity, but the real change will come from you only
 jab tak jaivik utpaadon kii maang nahin badhati
 The farmer will be troubled and the fields will be poisonous
 pradhanmantri ne sikkim ko pehla jaivik kheti vaala rajya ghoshit kiya 'everything we eat from the market contains chemicals
 ye hamen pataa he
 Where does all this go hamaare sharir main hi jaataa he na
 
 
 Now we have stopped taking such products and we are eating only organic
 ' maalcha maarg main kharidari karne ai puja nanda hamen bataati hai
 Such are Vijay Dahiya, who retired from the army, who says that radish which looks very beautiful is being cleaned in what manner and in what way
 
 The cabbage that looks so beautiful never has a worm in it
 
 How can it be so that there is no insect in it? 
 Not a worm because chemical is used
 aapaki plate tak pahunchane vaale zahreele khaane ko lekar ham aapako kai kahaniyaan dikhaa chuke hai
 Whether it is vegetables grown in poisonous water in Hindon area of delhi, or ginger that has been brightened by acid
 1960 or 70 ke daur main harith kranti ke baad rasayanon kaa andhadhundh istemaal shuru hua jisase zehar khaane ke saath logon ke sharir main pahunchane laga
 In Malwa, Punjab, the number of sick people increased so much that people started calling the train from Bathinda to Bikaner a cancer train
 aaj hamaare khaane main tarah tarah ke rasayan alag alag bimariyon kaa khatra liye maujuud hai
 For example, chloropyrifos hinders children's mental development
 sirdard, chakkar aana or mansapeshiyon main anthan aam beemaari he
 Doctors have found parts of this chemical in breast milk also
 indoslphan, ab pratibandhit he jisase kai logon kii jaan jane kii khabar ai
 Hepta chlor affects your nervous system and liver
 elderin or dediti, cancer or napunsakata jaisi bimariyon kii vajah hai
 This list of diseases is long but a large part of the society has become aware
 iskaa jawaab he parmparik tareeke se kii gai jaivik kheti jisamen rasayanon kaa istemaal na ho or zehar aapke sharir main na pahunche
 Where farming has been a loss deal for the farmer, there are some different difficulties for the farmer in organic farming as the market is full of poisonous pesticides and big companies are interested in selling chemical pesticides and promoting chemical farming
 aise main jaivik utpaada mahange ho jate hai
 It is not easy to reach them to the market
 maang or utpaadan kaa talmail bithaana abhi kathin he
 Farmers do not get paid on time and the biggest thing is the reliability of the product
 lekin dilli se mahaz 60 kilometre dur bulandshahr ke loharara gaanv main 65 saal ke naresh sirohi or unke bete dharmendra ne jaise in sari mushkilon se paar paa liya he
 Naresh Sirohi opted for organic farming after retiring from the army and his son Dharmendra quit his frozen job
 aaj unke kheton main padane vaali khaad se kitnashkon tak- sab kuch jaivik hai yani zehar kaa namonishaan nahin
 The Sirohi family has started the process of growing vegetables and grains for the last four years on nearly five acres of land
 sirohi parivaar gaay kaa gobar, gomutra, sukhi pattiyaan, gud, kelaa or papeeta jaisi samagriyon se khaad or poshak tatv banaate hai
 All of these things are found in their fields and homes, so the cost of farming has reduced greatly
 'hamaari laagat bahut ghat gai he or jo chizein ham paidaa kar rahe hai unki acchhee keemat milti he
 The biggest thing is that the soil of our fields has become very good by not using chemicals
 ab na ham khud zehar kha rahe hai or na dusron ko khilaa rahe hai
 'dharmendra's father Naresh Sirohi says
 bulandshahr ke dharmendra sirohi gaay ke gobar or gomutra se khaad banaate hai or usase laagat ghati he
 Similar changes are taking place in the lives of farmers in the villages of Bundelkhand, about 500 km from Bulandshahr

 palaayan bhi hota he lekin jaivik kheti ne hamaari zindagi main badlaav kiya he
 Now we are able to save some money at the end of the month
 hamaari zarurat ye he ki jaivik utpaadon kii maang bade
 The farmer is making a lot of money but if the demand increases, the profits will increase and the cost will decrease further
 ' Getting farmers out of the cycle of debt and cultivating profits was not so easy, and some entrepreneurs have joined the fight in the war of poverty, who are broadening this change, where their crop between the crop and the customer links Are added

 Awasthi says that she needed to encourage the farmers and for this the first thing they need was the right price for the crop they are growing
 “ham kaaphi pehle se shahari garibon ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 We have seen that many people have come to the cities but want to go back to the village

 hamane kisaanon se kaha ki aap mehnat karte ho to aam daam tay karo
 This created enthusiasm among the farmers
 ” The price of organic fruits and vegetables purchased in this way is 30 to 40 percent more than the normal products coming to the market

 chaahe dilli ke hindon ilaake main zahreele pani main ugi subjiyan ho yaa phir acid se chamkaaya gaya adarak
 In the 1960s and 70s, after the Green Revolution, the indiscriminate use of chemicals started, which led to the poisoning taking place in people's bodies
 punjab ke malwa main bimaaron kii sankhya aisi badi ki bathinda se bikaner ko jane vaali railgadee ko log cancer train kehane lage
 Today, different types of chemicals are present in our food to carry different diseases
 jaise chloropiariphos, bacchon ke maansik vikaas main baadha daalata he
 Headache, dizziness and muscle spasms are common illnesses
 doctoron ne to maa ke doodh main bhi is rasayan ke ansh paye hai
 Indosulfan is now banned, leading to the death of many people
 hepta chlor, aapke nervas system or liver par asar daalata he
 Aldrin and DDT are the cause of diseases such as cancer and impotence
 bimariyon kii yah list lambi he lekin samaaj kaa ek bada hissaa jaagruk ho gaya he
 The answer is traditional organic farming, in which chemicals are not used and poison does not reach your body
 jahaan kheti kisaan ke liye ghate kaa sauda rahi he vahaan jaivik kheti main to kisaan ke liye kuch alag mushkilen hai kyonki bazaar zahreele kitnashkon se pata hua he or badi badi companiyon ke hit rasinic kitnashkon ko bechney or chemical forming ko badhaava dene main he
 In such a situation, organic products become expensive
 unhen bazaar tak pahunchaana aasaan nahin
 It is difficult to keep pace with demand and production
 kisaanon ko samay par bhugtan nahin miltaa or sabase badi baat utpaada kii vishwasaneeyata
 But in Loharra village of Bulandshahr, just 60 km from Delhi, 65-year-old Naresh Sirohi and his son Dharmendra have overcome all these difficulties
 naresh sirohi ne fouj se ritair hone ke baad jaivik kheti kaa rasta chunaa or unke bete dharmendra ne apni jami jamaai naukari chhod di
 Today, everything from manure to pesticides in their fields - everything is organic, ie not poisoned
 kareeb paanch acre zamin par sirohi parivaar ne pichley chaar saal se subjiyon or anaj ko ugane kaa silsilaa shuru kiya he
 The Sirohi family makes compost and nutrients from materials such as cow dung, cow urine, dry leaves, jaggery, banana and papaya
 inamen se tamaam chizein unke kheton or ghar main mil jaati hai isaliye kheti kaa kharch bahut kam ho gaya he
 'our costs have come down greatly and the things we produce are well received
 sabase badi baat ye he ki hamaare kheton kii mitti rasayan istemaal na karne se kaaphi acchhee ho gai he
 Now we are neither eating poison ourselves nor feeding others
 ' dharmendra ke pita naresh sirohi kehete hai
 Dharmendra Sirohi of Bulandshahr makes manure from cow dung and cow urine and has reduced the cost
 bulandshahr se kareeb 500 kilometre dur bundelkhand ke gaanvon main kisaanon kii zindagi main hi aisa hi badlaav aa rahaa he
 Near Lalitpur on the border of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, Bhagwan Das and many of his companions are earning between 20 and 25 thousand rupees a month
 jaivik kheti se jude is kisaan network kii ek kadi hai jagabhaan kushvaha jo apni passbook dikhaate hai
 The bank entries show that they are constantly getting money
 'pichley maheene ke bheetar yahaan kisaan samooh ne har maheene ausatan sava lakh rupee ke fal or sabziyaan bechnaa shuru kar deen
 The farmers are happy that their cost is continuously decreasing and the goods are being sold at home
 ' kamyaabi kaa ye graph dhire dhire bad rahaa he
 This is a refreshing hope in Bundelkhand, which shows a depressed picture of farmers due to debt, migration and suicide
 ek aisi kranti kii shuruyaat jisamen jagabaan or kamalesh kareeb 15 acre zamin par kai kisaan pariwaron ke saath organic forming kar rahe hai
 Jagabhan's brother Kamlesh Kushwaha seems excited
 'haa bahut bade ilaake main yahaan kisaan ab bhi pareshaan he
 There is also migration but organic farming has changed our lives
 ab ham maheene ke ant main kuch paisa bachaa paa rahe hai
 Our need is to increase the demand for organic products
 kisaan bahut kuch paisa kar rahaa he lekin maang bade to munafa badhegaa or laagat or ghategi
 ' kisaanon ko karz ke chakravyuuh se baahar nikaalnaa or munaafe kii kheti karana itnaa aasaan nahin tha or garibi kii jang se ladane main kuch udhyamiyon ne saath diya he jo is badlaav ko vyapak bana rahe hai jahaan kheton main ugi unki fasal or graahak ke bich kii kadiyaan judati hai
 Jyoti Awasthi, who markets organic products along Delhi's Ghaziabad and Malcha Marg, has come a long way in the last nearly two years
 satat argenic naam se unki pahal rang laa rahi he
 She has today joined dozens of peasant families in western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bundelkhand
 avasthi kahati hai ki vah kisaanon ko utsahit karne kii zarurat thi or iske liye pehali chiz unhen us fasal ke sahi daam chaiye jo vah uga rahe hai
 “we have been working with the urban poor for a long time
 hamane ye dekha ki bahut saare log shaharon main aa to gayi hai lekin waapas gaanv janaa chaahate hai
 These people are from peasant families
 hamane in ilaakon main jaakar kisaanon ko jaivik kheti karne ko protsaahit kiya or unke utpaada us ilaake ke retail bhav main kharidne shuru kiye
 We told the farmers that if you work hard then fix the common price
 isse kisaanon main utsaah paidaa hua
 " is tarah se kharide gayi jaivik fal or sabziyon kii keemat bazaar aate aate saamaanya utpaadon ke mukaable 30 se 40 pratishat adhik hoti he
 This is the challenge for entrepreneurs like Jyoti
 “shuruyaat main hamane ghaataa khaakar ye kaam shuru kiya lekin hamen ummid he ki kisaanon or graahakon main jaagrukta badhegi to ye sabake liye vin-vin vaali sichuation hogi
 ”says Jyoti Awasthi, director of Sustain
 aise udhyamiyon kii ab ek kadi ban rahi he
 Take, for example, 38-year-old Ganesh Chaudhary, whose business of organic products is expanding from Katni in Madhya Pradesh to Hyderabad in the south
 peshey se ejeeniyar rahe choudhary ‘aarogy sukh’ ke sansthaapak or saajhedaar hai or beeing desi ke naam se kai jaivik utpaada banaate hai
 Desi cow is among their products
 vah kehete hai ki in dinon gaay ke naam par utpaat machaa rahe logon ko gaay kii asal ahmiyat pataa nahin he ki vah kitne phaayde de sakati he
 Chaudhary has also brought together several farmer families
 vah kehete hai, “pehle main sochataa tha ki main akelaa ye kaam kar saktaa hum lekin kaam faisla gaya or ab khushi he ki kai pariwaron ko main apane saath jod rahaa hum
 Many of my hands seem to have moved
 ” These stories are important because they are coming from the areas where there is often disappointing news on the situation of the farmers
 kahin-kahin hi sahi ummid kii kiran dikh rahi he
 Meet 25-year-old Bhavesh Wankhede Patil
 mumbai ke tata insttitute of soshal science (TISS) se padhai karne ke baad aaj wo vidarbha ke maayoos kisaanon main josh bhar rahe hai
 Bhavesh tells us that among all the families where farmers committed suicide, many of them want to join their campaign of organic farming
 bhavesh kehete hai jab unke pita ko dil kaa daura padaa to unhen rasinic kheti ke kuprabhavon ko samajhane kaa mauka mila
 He came to know that on the one hand poison is reaching the customers' body, while the farmer is cultivating losses and getting stuck in debt
 “hamane donon ore kii samasyaon ko ek saath rakhkar dekha or tay kiya ki kisaanon ko sasteneble agriculture kii ore le janaa hoga
 We teach the farmer how he can reduce the cost of his farming
 ham unhen sikhaate hai ki gaay kaa gobar, gomutra or pattiyaan or west kaa istemaal kar khaad kaise banaai jaati he
 ”bhavesh set up a network to provide technical advice to farmers along with things
 vah daawa karte hai ki aaj ek hazaar se adhik kisaan unke saath jude hai
 Organic farming is reducing costs for Vidarbha farmers, burdened with debt
 aaj jab desh main kuch log gauraksha ke naam par utpaat machaa rahe hon or dharmik jajbaton ko bhadakaane kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he to ye kisaan or udhyami gaay kii aarthik upyogita or guseva kaa nayaa rasta dikhaa rahe hai
 Dharmendra Sirohi and his father make manure and nutrients at home from cow dung and cow urine which is sufficient for their cultivation and in Bundelkhand, Kamlesh and his colleagues have also reduced the cost of farming by using organic manure and now they are zero Budgets are moving towards farming
 2015 main sarkaar kii apni report ke hisaab se jaivik utpaadon kaa bazaar 25 se 30 pratishat salanaa kii dar se bad rahaa he or ek anumaan ke mutabik agle kuch saalon main 9000 karod rupee kaa hoga
 In the organic products business, it is a tough challenge to build the credibility of your product in the market with small entrepreneurs and farmers
 jahaan satat kii avasthi kahati hai ki wo prayogshaalaon se certificate hasil kar apane cells centaron main graahakon kii santushti ke liye rakhti hai
 At the same time, Ganesh says that certification is necessary but the real seal is the satisfaction of the customer
 “agar graahak ko phayda hoga to vah zarur hamaare utpaada kharidega
 "says Ganesh
 lekin chote udhyamiyon ko pataa he ki unka muqabla badi badi companiyon se he jinke paas rasinic kheti ke utpaada bechney ke liye paise or vigyapanon kii kami nahin he
 In such a situation, people like Nivedita Varshney have a special role to add these links
 nivedita kahati hai ki vah kisaanon, udhyamiyon or kharidaaron ke network ko jodne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The comments vah bataati hai, “jab kisaan chemical forming se organic farming kii ore aata he to mitti se zahreele chemicals ko hatane main kai saal lagate hai
 Usually it is three years
 ham is period ko kanvarjan period kehete hai or certification bhi under kanvarjan ke naam se hota he or isi jaankaree ke saath utpaada bechaa jaataa he
 At this time, the farmer needs a big support so that his produce is sold in the market and someone will help him to meet his deficit
 aise main kai udhyami, sarkari or gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kisaan kii madad kar rahe hai
 This is quite important
 VIDEO- jaivik kheti ne badal di kisaanon kii kismat If you look closely, you will know that the relation of air going into your lungs is also related to what you are eating because the use of chemicals and chemical fertilizers also dissolve a lot of poison in the air
 jaivik kheti ko lekar hamane ye kahaniyaan badlaav or ummid kii ek jhalak bhar hai
 Farmers are still worried and they have to go a long way on the road to prosperity, but the real change will come from you only
 jab tak jaivik utpaadon kii maang nahin badhati
 The farmer will be troubled and the fields will be poisonous
 iskaa jawaab he parmparik tareeke se kii gai jaivik kheti jisamen rasayanon kaa istemaal na ho or zehar aapke sharir main na pahunche
 Where farming has been a loss deal for the farmer, there are some different difficulties for the farmer in organic farming as the market is full of poisonous pesticides and big companies are interested in selling chemical pesticides and promoting chemical farming
 aise main jaivik utpaada mahange ho jate hai
 It is not easy to reach them to the market
 maang or utpaadan kaa talmail bithaana abhi kathin he
 Farmers do not get paid on time and the biggest thing is the reliability of the product
 lekin dilli se mahaz 60 kilometre dur bulandshahr ke loharara gaanv main 65 saal ke naresh sirohi or unke bete dharmendra ne jaise in sari mushkilon se paar paa liya he
 Naresh Sirohi opted for organic farming after retiring from the army and his son Dharmendra quit his frozen job
 aaj unke kheton main padane vaali khaad se kitnashkon tak- sab kuch jaivik hai yani zehar kaa namonishaan nahin
 The Sirohi family has started the process of growing vegetables and grains for the last four years on nearly five acres of land
 sirohi parivaar gaay kaa gobar, gomutra, sukhi pattiyaan, gud, kelaa or papeeta jaisi samagriyon se khaad or poshak tatv banaate hai
 All of these things are found in their fields and homes, so the cost of farming has reduced greatly
 'hamaari laagat bahut ghat gai he or jo chizein ham paidaa kar rahe hai unki acchhee keemat milti he
 The biggest thing is that the soil of our fields has become very good by not using chemicals
 ab na ham khud zehar kha rahe hai or na dusron ko khilaa rahe hai
 'dharmendra's father Naresh Sirohi says
 bulandshahr ke dharmendra sirohi gaay ke gobar or gomutra se khaad banaate hai or usase laagat ghati he
 Similar changes are taking place in the lives of farmers in the villages of Bundelkhand, about 500 km from Bulandshahr
 uttar pradesh or or madhya pradesh kii seemaa par lalitpur ke paas bhagwaan das auki unke kai saathi maheene main 20 se 25 hazaar rupee kii kamai kar rahe hai
 Jagbhan Kushwaha is one of the links of this farmer network associated with organic farming which shows his passbook
 bank kii pravishtiyon se pataa chalata he ki unke paas lagaataar paisa aa rahaa he
 'within the last month, the farmers group started selling fruits and vegetables worth an average of Rs 1
25 lakh every month
 kisaan is baat se khush hai ki unki laagat lagaataar ghat rahi he or ghar baithe maal bik rahaa he
 'this graph of success is growing slowly
 karz, palaayan or khudakushi kii vajah se kisaanon kii maayoos tasviir dikhaane vaale bundelkhand main ye ek ummid kaa tazaa jhonka he
 The beginning of a revolution in which Jagban and Kamlesh are doing organic farming with many farmer families on about 15 acres of land
 jagabhaan ke bhai kamalesh kushvaha utsahit dikhte hai
 'yes, in a large area, the farmer is still worried
 palaayan bhi hota he lekin jaivik kheti ne hamaari zindagi main badlaav kiya he
 Now we are able to save some money at the end of the month
 hamaari zarurat ye he ki jaivik utpaadon kii maang bade
 The farmer is making a lot of money but if the demand increases, the profits will increase and the cost will decrease further
 ' Getting farmers out of the cycle of debt and cultivating profits was not so easy, and some entrepreneurs have joined the fight in the war of poverty, who are broadening this change, where their crop between the crop and the customer links Are added
 dilli se sate ghaziabad or maalcha maarg main jaivik utpaadon kaa bazaar lagane vaali jyoti avasthi ne pichley kareeb 2 saalon main ek lambi duuri tay kar chuki hai
 His initiative, called Sustainable Organic, is paying off
 vah aaj pashchimi uttar pradesh, uttarakhand or bundelkhand ke darjanon kisaan pariwaron ke saath jud chuki he
 Awasthi says that she needed to encourage the farmers and for this the first thing they need was the right price for the crop they are growing
 “ham kaaphi pehle se shahari garibon ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 We have seen that many people have come to the cities but want to go back to the village
 ye log kisaan pariwaron se hai
 We encouraged farmers to go to these areas to do organic farming and started buying their produce at the retail price of that area
 hamane kisaanon se kaha ki aap mehnat karte ho to aam daam tay karo
 This created enthusiasm among the farmers
 ” The price of organic fruits and vegetables purchased in this way is 30 to 40 percent more than the normal products coming to the market
 yahi jyoti jaise udhyamiyon ke liye chunauti he
 “initially we started this work by eating losses, but we hope that if awareness among farmers and customers increases, it will be a win-win situation for all
 ” satat kii nideshak jyoti avasthi kahati hai
 Such entrepreneurs are now becoming a link
 misaal ke taur par 38 saal ke ganesh choudhary ko lijiye jinka jaivik utpaadon kaa kaarobaar madhya pradesh ke katni se lekar dakshin main hyderabad tak fail rahaa he
 Chaudhary, an engineer by profession, is the founder and partner of 'arogya Sukh' and produces many organic products under the name Being Desi
 unke utpaadon ke madhya main he desi gaay
 He says that these days, people who are creating problems in the name of the cow do not know the real importance of the cow, how many benefits it can give
 choudhary ne bhi kai kisaan pariwaron ko apane saath jod liya he
 He says, “earlier i used to think that i could do this work alone but the work was decided and now i am happy that i am connecting many families with myself

 25 saal ke bhavesh wankhade patil se miliye
 After studying at the Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) in Mumbai, today he is energizing the depressed farmers of Vidarbha
 bhavesh hamen bataate hai ki un tamaam pariwaron main jahaan kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii unamem se kai log jaivik kheti kii unki muhim se judana chaahate hai
 Bhavesh says when his father suffered a heart attack, he got a chance to understand the ill effects of chemical farming
 unhen pataa chalaa ki ek ore graahakon ke sharir main zehar pahunch rahaa he vahiin kisaan ghate kii kheti kar rahaa he or karz main fansata ja rahaa he
 “we looked at the problems on both sides together and decided that the farmers would have to be taken towards sustainable agriculture
 ham kisaan ko yah sikhaate hai ki vah apni kheti kii laagat kaise kam kar sakate hai
 We teach them how to make manure using cow dung, cow urine and leaves and vest
 ” bhavesh ne chizon ke saath saath kisaanon ko takneekee salaah dene ke liye network taiyaar kiya
 He claims that today more than a thousand farmers are associated with him
 karz ke boj se dabe vidarbha ke kisaanon ke liye jaivik kheti se laagat gata rahe hai
 Today, when some people in the country are creating uproar in the name of cow protection and the process of provoking religious sentiments is going on, these farmers and entrepreneurs are showing a new way of economic utility and cow service of cow
 dharmendra sirohi or unke pita gaay ke gobar or gomutra se khaad or poshak tatv ghar par hi banaate hai jo unki kheti ke liye paryaapt he or bundelkhand main kamalesh or unke saathiyon ne bhi jaivik khaad ke prayog se kheti kii laagat ghataayi he or ab wo zero bajet farming kii ore bad rahe hai
 According to the government's own report in 2015, the market for organic products is growing at a rate of 25 to 30 per cent per annum and according to an estimate will be Rs 9000 crore in the next few years
 jaivik utpaadon ke kaarobaar main chote udhyamiyon or kisaanon ke saath bazaar main apane product kii vishwasaneeyata ko bananaa kadi chunauti he
 Where Sustaini Awasthi says that she obtains certificates from laboratories and keeps them in her sales centers for customer satisfaction
 vahiin ganesh kehete hai ki certification zaruri he lekin asli muhar graahak kaa santosh he
 “if the customer benefits then he will definitely buy our products
 ” ganesh kehete hai
 But small entrepreneurs know that they are competing with big companies who do not have money and advertisements to sell chemical farming products
 aise main in kadiyon ko jodne ke liye nivedita varshney jaisi logon kaa khaas role he
 Nivedita says that she is trying to connect the network of farmers, entrepreneurs and buyers
 tippaniyan She explains, "when the farmer moves from chemical farming to organic farming, it takes years for poisonous chemicals to be removed from the soil
 amuman ye teen saal kaa vakt hota he
 We call this period the conversion period and the certification is also called under conversion and with this information the product is sold
 is vakt kisaan ko bade sahare kii zarurat hoti he taaki uskaa utpaada bazaar main bike or uske ghate ko puraa karne main koi uski madad kare
 In such a situation, many entrepreneurs, government and ngos are helping the farmer

 kisaanon ko karz ke chakravyuuh se baahar nikaalnaa or munaafe kii kheti karana itnaa aasaan nahin tha or garibi kii jang se ladane main kuch udhyamiyon ne saath diya he jo is badlaav ko vyapak bana rahe hai jahaan kheton main ugi unki fasal or graahak ke bich kii kadiyaan judati hai
 Jyoti Awasthi, who markets organic products along Delhi's Ghaziabad and Malcha Marg, has come a long way in the last nearly two years
 satat argenic naam se unki pahal rang laa rahi he
 She has today joined dozens of peasant families in western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bundelkhand
 avasthi kahati hai ki vah kisaanon ko utsahit karne kii zarurat thi or iske liye pehali chiz unhen us fasal ke sahi daam chaiye jo vah uga rahe hai
 “we have been working with the urban poor for a long time
 hamane ye dekha ki bahut saare log shaharon main aa to gayi hai lekin waapas gaanv janaa chaahate hai
 These people are from peasant families
 hamane in ilaakon main jaakar kisaanon ko jaivik kheti karne ko protsaahit kiya or unke utpaada us ilaake ke retail bhav main kharidne shuru kiye
 We told the farmers that if you work hard then fix the common price
 isse kisaanon main utsaah paidaa hua
 " is tarah se kharide gayi jaivik fal or sabziyon kii keemat bazaar aate aate saamaanya utpaadon ke mukaable 30 se 40 pratishat adhik hoti he
 This is the challenge for entrepreneurs like Jyoti
 “shuruyaat main hamane ghaataa khaakar ye kaam shuru kiya lekin hamen ummid he ki kisaanon or graahakon main jaagrukta badhegi to ye sabake liye vin-vin vaali sichuation hogi
 ”says Jyoti Awasthi, director of Sustain
 aise udhyamiyon kii ab ek kadi ban rahi he
 Take, for example, 38-year-old Ganesh Chaudhary, whose business of organic products is expanding from Katni in Madhya Pradesh to Hyderabad in the south
 peshey se ejeeniyar rahe choudhary ‘aarogy sukh’ ke sansthaapak or saajhedaar hai or beeing desi ke naam se kai jaivik utpaada banaate hai
 Desi cow is among their products
 vah kehete hai ki in dinon gaay ke naam par utpaat machaa rahe logon ko gaay kii asal ahmiyat pataa nahin he ki vah kitne phaayde de sakati he
 Chaudhary has also brought together several farmer families
 vah kehete hai, “pehle main sochataa tha ki main akelaa ye kaam kar saktaa hum lekin kaam faisla gaya or ab khushi he ki kai pariwaron ko main apane saath jod rahaa hum
 Many of my hands seem to have moved
 ” These stories are important because they are coming from the areas where there is often disappointing news on the situation of the farmers
 kahin-kahin hi sahi ummid kii kiran dikh rahi he
 Meet 25-year-old Bhavesh Wankhede Patil
 mumbai ke tata insttitute of soshal science (TISS) se padhai karne ke baad aaj wo vidarbha ke maayoos kisaanon main josh bhar rahe hai
 Bhavesh tells us that among all the families where farmers committed suicide, many of them want to join their campaign of organic farming
 bhavesh kehete hai jab unke pita ko dil kaa daura padaa to unhen rasinic kheti ke kuprabhavon ko samajhane kaa mauka mila
 He came to know that on the one hand poison is reaching the customers' body, while the farmer is cultivating losses and getting stuck in debt
 “hamane donon ore kii samasyaon ko ek saath rakhkar dekha or tay kiya ki kisaanon ko sasteneble agriculture kii ore le janaa hoga
 We teach the farmer how he can reduce the cost of his farming
 ham unhen sikhaate hai ki gaay kaa gobar, gomutra or pattiyaan or west kaa istemaal kar khaad kaise banaai jaati he
 ”bhavesh set up a network to provide technical advice to farmers along with things
 vah daawa karte hai ki aaj ek hazaar se adhik kisaan unke saath jude hai
 Organic farming is reducing costs for Vidarbha farmers, burdened with debt
 aaj jab desh main kuch log gauraksha ke naam par utpaat machaa rahe hon or dharmik jajbaton ko bhadakaane kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he to ye kisaan or udhyami gaay kii aarthik upyogita or guseva kaa nayaa rasta dikhaa rahe hai
 Dharmendra Sirohi and his father make manure and nutrients at home from cow dung and cow urine which is sufficient for their cultivation and in Bundelkhand, Kamlesh and his colleagues have also reduced the cost of farming by using organic manure and now they are zero Budgets are moving towards farming
 2015 main sarkaar kii apni report ke hisaab se jaivik utpaadon kaa bazaar 25 se 30 pratishat salanaa kii dar se bad rahaa he or ek anumaan ke mutabik agle kuch saalon main 9000 karod rupee kaa hoga
 In the organic products business, it is a tough challenge to build the credibility of your product in the market with small entrepreneurs and farmers
 jahaan satat kii avasthi kahati hai ki wo prayogshaalaon se certificate hasil kar apane cells centaron main graahakon kii santushti ke liye rakhti hai
 At the same time, Ganesh says that certification is necessary but the real seal is the satisfaction of the customer
 “agar graahak ko phayda hoga to vah zarur hamaare utpaada kharidega
 "says Ganesh
 lekin chote udhyamiyon ko pataa he ki unka muqabla badi badi companiyon se he jinke paas rasinic kheti ke utpaada bechney ke liye paise or vigyapanon kii kami nahin he
 In such a situation, people like Nivedita Varshney have a special role to add these links
 nivedita kahati hai ki vah kisaanon, udhyamiyon or kharidaaron ke network ko jodne kii koshish kar rahi he
 The comments vah bataati hai, “jab kisaan chemical forming se organic farming kii ore aata he to mitti se zahreele chemicals ko hatane main kai saal lagate hai
 Usually it is three years
 ham is period ko kanvarjan period kehete hai or certification bhi under kanvarjan ke naam se hota he or isi jaankaree ke saath utpaada bechaa jaataa he
 At this time, the farmer needs a big support so that his produce is sold in the market and someone will help him to meet his deficit
 aise main kai udhyami, sarkari or gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kisaan kii madad kar rahe hai
 This is quite important
 VIDEO- jaivik kheti ne badal di kisaanon kii kismat If you look closely, you will know that the relation of air going into your lungs is also related to what you are eating because the use of chemicals and chemical fertilizers also dissolve a lot of poison in the air
 jaivik kheti ko lekar hamane ye kahaniyaan badlaav or ummid kii ek jhalak bhar hai
 Farmers are still worried and they have to go a long way on the road to prosperity, but the real change will come from you only
 jab tak jaivik utpaadon kii maang nahin badhati
 The farmer will be troubled and the fields will be poisonous
 “ham kaaphi pehle se shahari garibon ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 We have seen that many people have come to the cities but want to go back to the village
 ye log kisaan pariwaron se hai
 We encouraged farmers to go to these areas to do organic farming and started buying their produce at the retail price of that area
 hamane kisaanon se kaha ki aap mehnat karte ho to aam daam tay karo
 This created enthusiasm among the farmers
 ” The price of organic fruits and vegetables purchased in this way is 30 to 40 percent more than the normal products coming to the market
 yahi jyoti jaise udhyamiyon ke liye chunauti he
 “initially we started this work by eating losses, but we hope that if awareness among farmers and customers increases, it will be a win-win situation for all

 Today, when some people in the country are creating uproar in the name of cow protection and the process of provoking religious sentiments is going on, these farmers and entrepreneurs are showing a new way of economic utility and cow service of cow

 According to the government's own report in 2015, the market for organic products is growing at a rate of 25 to 30 per cent per annum and according to an estimate will be Rs 9000 crore in the next few years

 " "swayamvar ke baad raakhi saavant ek baar aaropon ke ghere main hai
 The producer-director of a film has accused Rakhi Sawant of betrayal and grabbing money
 raakhi par aarope he ki raakhi ne pehle unki film kaam karne ke liye peshgi le lee or jab taarikh kareeb aayi to ve chanpat ho gayi
 The producer's phone does not even pick up Bollywood's top item girl Rakhi Sawant in the dock of allegations by the producer-director of a film
 us film kaa naam he, lav khichdi
 Rakhi Sawant was to play a maid in the film Love Khichdi
 film nirdeshak e shrinivas iljaam laga rahe hai ki unhone raakhi saavant ko baqayada is film ke liye bayana yani token mani bhi de di thi, lekin jab shooting kii taarikh aayi, to ve laapata ho gai
 Moreover, the producer-director of the film even alleges that when he called Rakhi, Rakhi did not pick up the phone
 aaropon se raakhi ne kiya inkarnirmaataa-nirdeshak kaa kahana he ki raakhi ne ye role 5 lakh rupye main sin kiya tha
 The director of the film says that earlier he was taking Sonali Kulkarni for the role of maid, but Rakhi said that she can do this role quite well, then she gave Rakhi the role of maid in Love Khichdi
 haalanki raakhi kaa kahana he ki lav khichdi ke nirmaataa-nirdeshak ke aarope bebuniyaad he, wo to unhen jaanati tak nahin hai
 The surprising thing is that Rakhi has already done an item number in the film Paisa Vasool with the producer-director of Love Khichdi
 saath hi karan johar ke sho coffee vid karan main raakhi lav khichdi ke bare main bataa chuki hai
 Now the producers are regretting the film Love Khichdi is being released on this Friday, but the question arises why Rakhi did all this
 kya raakhi publicity ke us mukaam par pahunch chuki hai ki unhen naukaraani kaa kirdaar kariyar ke liye munasib nahin laga
 The director is cursing the day when he offered the role of a maid in Rakhi's film 'love Khichdi'
 diarector ko dukh is baat kaa he ki raakhi saavant ne pehle unki film paisa vasuul main bhi kaam kiya he, lekin ab raakhi ne unako pahchaanane tak se inkaar kar diya he
 The unit is upset with Rakhi's rude behavior and wants to teach the item girl a lesson
 raakhi kaa naukaraani kaa role baad main sonaali kulkarni ne kiya
 Feeling cheated, almost all the 16 grooms who came to the swayamvara of the groom's own groom are now feeling cheated
 jis raakhi ko wo apana banane aaye the wo raakhi ab dhokheybaaj lagane lagi he
 Rakhi, who created history by creating a swayamvar on TV, got accusations of being accused during the show itself
 bady dhoomdhaam se raakhi ne apane swayamvar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 The 16 young men who had dreamed of marrying Rakhi made a lot of efforts to win Rakhi's heart, but when Rakhi started rejecting the groom one by one, the truth of the swayamvara also came out with the groom
 ab raakhi lagane lageen dhokheybaajrakhi ke swayamvar main aise kai duulhe the, jinako raakhi pasand karne lagi thim
 Rakhi tried their love, talked to them for hours and when it started feeling that Rakhi might have found her partner just then Rakhi would find some evil in it and put her out of the show
 kuch aisa hi hua tha rishikesh ke manmohan tiwari ke saath
 Manmohan, who was seduced by Rakhi's words and actions, felt that Rakhi's last choice was her
 raakhi unke ghar rishikesh bhi gai, lekin jab faisla sunaane kaa vakt aayaa to raakhi ko manmohan dhokhebaaz najar aane lage
 He showed Manmohan a way out of the Swayamvara
 raakhi ne yahaan tak kah diya ki unka dil tut gaya he or swayamvar se baahar jane kii dhamkee tak de daali
 Right now only engaged, not married "" But it seems Rakhi's heart was strong enough to return
 ek baar phir bache hue duulhon ko mauka dene ke liye
 Perhaps, seeing the same style of Rakhi, the grooms who came on the show started feeling that Rakhi is cheating them
 ab swanyavar ke niyamon ke mutabik raakhi ko kisi ek ko to apana duulhaa chunanaa hi tha, lihaaja final tak pahunche dilli ke maanas or kshitij ko darkinar kar raakhi ne paradesi babu ilesh ko apana duulhaa chun liya lekin unase shaadi nahin kii
 Rakhi's decision to postpone marriage by engagement made her once again think that Rakhi's swayamvar was not just a spectacle of publicity
 agar aisa he to swayamvar main aae duulhe khud ko dhokhebaaji kaa shikaar to samajhege hi
 Not looking good, Mankarakhi chose his groom in front of the whole world by putting a garland on Ilesh's neck, but the biggest suspense of the country's largest swayamvar still remains
 raakhi ne jise apana duulhaa chunaa he, kya raakhi usee ke naam kaa sindur bhi apni maang main sajaaegi
 According to Rakhi, they have decided to marry Ilesh
 ab sawaal ye he ki agar raakhi ne shaadi kaa faisla kar hi liya he to phir swayamvar main sagaai kii jagah shaadi kyon nahin kii
 At the time of Swayamvar's decision, Rakhi's body language and Rakhi's intentions are not seen well with her words
