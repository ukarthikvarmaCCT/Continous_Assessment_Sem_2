 No PMO official pressured, but Congress mps said that pm's name should not come up
 kisne kaha yah yaad nahin he
 They all remember the rest of the date, etc
 vinod raay ne kitaab main likhaa he ki tu-ji spectrum aavanton kii prakriya par sawaal uthaate hue kanoon mantralay ne piem ko chitthee likhi vitt mantralay ne piem ko chitthee likhi
 Commerce Minister Kamal Nath also warned that it should be reviewed in the Group of Ministers
 raja ne bhi patr likhakar bataaya ki ve kya karne ja rahe hai
 Even then the Prime Minister did not take any action
 agar ve raja ko roak dete to itihaas aaj kuch or hota
 A
 Raja had given all the addresses to the Prime Minister in the letter, but instead of taking a clean stand, PM wrote so much that your letter has been received
 koi karrwai nahin kii
 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's old statement is that he had expressed his concern about the first come first serve policy before the king
 aaj is intervyuu ke baad bijepi kii taraf se prakaash jhaavdekar ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ne jo sansad main jawaab diya tha or jo file par he donon alag he
 They never opposed A
 Raja means they were supporting the king
 purv pradhanmantri ko jawaab dena chahie
 The Congress cannot escape accountability as the charge also goes to 10 Janpath
 congress netaa kamalnath ne kaha ki unhone chitthee likhakar or baat kar kah diya tha ki gadabadi ho rahi he, magar purv pradhanmantri ne koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 They made a big mistake
 kya kamalnath ne yah baat congress party kii pramukh sonia gandhi ko bhi bataai thi jo upie kii cheirperson bhi thi
 When Prakash Javadekar sought answers from 10 Janpath, Abhishek Manu Singhvi came to the Congress headquarters in his neighborhood to answer
 kaha ki vinod raay ne jo kaha he wo sieji kii report main kah chuke hai
 Today they are repeating the same thing so that book sales increase
 inhen aaropon ke aadhaar par adaalat main kai yachikaayen di gayi ki purv pradhanmantri or purv vittamantri ko notice jari kiya jaae magar adaalat ne nahin mana
 Then why not Vinod Rai himself filed an FIR
 aaj un baton ko bataane kaa kya matlab he
 After this, Abhishek Manu Singhvi started reminding the former Accountant General that why he only remembers the report of Congress governments
 gujarat sarkaar par sieji kii report kii baat kyon nahin karte
 In which the CAG has said that the state government showed a revenue surplus of five and a half thousand crores wrong
 gujarat sarkaar kai prakaar ke karon ko vasuulne main naakaam rahi
 Eight thousand to 16 thousand crores remained outstanding
 is bare main raay sahab kii koi kitaab nahin ai he
 While traveling on the internet, a report of Indian Express was received on 3 December 2012
 sieji se ek ritair afasar or post and telecomunication ke purv mahanideshak arapy singh kaa bayaan tha
 His colleagues went to the house of PAC chief Murli Manohar Joshi on a government holiday
 piesi kii report banane main madad karne ke liye
 He was asked to sign the report from the CAG headquarters
 jabaki ve report se sahamat nahin the
 The PAC report criticized the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, the Attorney General
 zaahir he iskaa bhi khandan hua hi hoga magar zikr isliye kiya ki aisi baton ko kab tak or kahaan tak gambhirtha se liya jaae
 What's new in what Vinod Rai said
 yah maamla adaalat main he
 The government has also changed at the center
 kya bijepi is maamle ko raajnneetik taur par hi uthaati rahegi yaa adhikarik taur par koi kadam bhi uthaaegi
 Does BJP believe that a criminal case is also made against him
 kamalnath ke bayaan ke baad congress kya karegi
 Sheila will side like Dixit's statement or will take the form of criticism criticizing Vinod Rai's statement
 america or iran ke bich sambandh ek baar phir bighad rahe hai
 However, US President Donald Trump has given a statement on relations with Iran that the US is not moving towards war with Iran
 isi bich iran ne kaha he ki vah aasaani se khadi deshon main america jahaajon ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 In recent times, tension between Washington and Tehran is at its peak
 iran ke rajanyik lagaataar koshish kar rahe hai ki kis tarah se america pratibandhon ko khaarij kiya jaae or newclear deal ke maamle main america ke virodh ko kam karaayaa jaae
 Iran and America have been very vocal in opposition to each other in recent times
 isi saptaah tel ke chaar tankeron par hue hamale ke baad america ne baghdad se apane kuch rajanyikon ko waapas bula liya tha
 The Barack Obama administration had earlier signed a nuclear deal with Iran, which the Trump administration ended in 2015
 trump ke is kadam ke chalate iran par kathor pratibandh ek baar phir se lagu ho gaye
 Iran's economy has been affected by US sanctions
 bharat, china or pakistan jaise deshon ko tel aayaat par milane vaali chhot ko bhi roak diya gaya he
 In a statement to Fars News Agency, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) deputy commander Saleh Joker said, "our short-range missiles can also easily target American warships in Gulf countries
" ' unhone kaha, 'america ek nayaa yuddh nahin jhel saktaa
 The situation in America is bad in terms of social and human resources
 america ke aarthik pratibandhon par iran kaa maananaa he ki washington keval aarthik pratibandhon ko badha rahaa he ki khadi ke deshon main apni sainya hissedari ko badha sake
 The United States is attempting to increase global pressure on Iran by citing an attack on the United Nations
 tehran kaa kahana he ki amarika kaa yah kadam keval manovaigyanik rup se laabh lene or raajnneetik bayaanbaji ke liye he
 a senior administration official in Washington said that the US is ready to negotiate with Iran but Iran is not ready for direct talks with Trump
 adhikari ne kaha, 'hamaara maananaa he ki donon deshon ke bich tanaav kam karne ke liye iran ko aage aana chahie or baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hona chahie
 President Donald Trump has appealed to Iranian leaders several times to negotiate a nuclear program
 khadi ke deshon main badhate tanaav ke maddenjar america ne aircrafter kariyar taiyaar kiye hai
 There is a fear among the people of this region that America and Iran may not be ready for war
 iran ke sena pramukh major general abdularahim mausavi ne kaha he, 'agar dushman desh hamaari takaton ke bare main galat andaja lagaataa he to yah uski ranneetik bhul sabit hone vaali he
 We will give such an answer that they will regret
 ' isse pehle varisht saansad hashmatullah ne twitor par chintaa jaahir kii thi ki iran or america ke bich red desk bananaa chahie jisase sambhavit yuddh ko roka ja sake
 Hashmatullah, head of the National Security Committee of the Iranian Parliament, said, "high officials in the US and Iran have ruled out the possibility of war
" lekin teesri takatein vishwa ke ek bade hisse ko tabah karne par tuli hui hai
 a red desk will be established between Iraq and Qatar, ending the tension between the two nations
 'iran ke sarvocch netaa yatullah khumaini ne isi saptaah kaha he ki tehran kisi bhi nae newclear deal par vaarta karne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 The Trump administration broke the deal in 2015, Iran has full nuclear bomb capability, sanctions were imposed on Iran
 ab antarrashtriya pratibandhon se bachane ke liye newclear deal kaa mudda uthaaya ja rahaa he
 Trump, however, believes Iran will be forced to stop missile and other nuclear programs due to pressure on economic policies, and Iran will loosen its grip in Iraq, Syria and Yemen
 iran ke videsh mantri mohammad javed jariff ne japan or china ke daure par kaha ki sirf samarthan main bayaan dena hi newclear deal ko bachaane ke liye kaaphi nahin hoga
 Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Jawad Zarif appealed to his friendly countries, including China and Russia, to take concrete steps to protect the deal after the US split from the 2015 nuclear deal
 iran ne britain, germany, france, se bhi apil kii ki america pratibandhon se iran kii arthvyavastha ko bachaaya jaae
 Inflation has gone up by 40% due to global sanctions in Iran
 iran ke parmaanu kaarykram par antarrashtriya samudaay dwaara lagaae gaye pratibandhon se iran kii arthvyavastha kai saal buree tarah prabhavit rahi he, 2015 main raashtrapati hasan ruhani ne un pratibandhon ko hataane ke badale main iran kii parmaanu gatividhiyon ko simit karne ke liye america or paanch anya deshon ke saath ek samjhaute par sahmati jataai thi
 After the agreement came into force, Iran's economy was back on track and GDP 12
 3 fisad badi
 But renewed US sanctions have drastically reduced GDP growth
 america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne ummid jataai he ki america iran ke saath yuddh ke raste par nahin bad rahaa he
 There are apprehensions that two of Trump's top advisers are in favor of a war with Iran
 yah puche jane par ki kya america iran ke saath yuddh kii disha main bad rahaa he, trump ne brihaspativaar ko kaha, ‘‘mujhe aisi ummid nahin he
 He tweeted a day earlier expressing his willingness to negotiate, "I am convinced that Iran would like to negotiate soon
" ’’trump ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar jon bolton or videsh mantri mike pompio iran ke khilaaf adhiktam dabaav kii trump sarkaar kii muhim ke aguva rahe hai
 An Iranian Revolutionary Guard official said on Friday that Iran's missiles could easily reach warships in the Persian Gulf and any part of West Asia
 arddh sarkari samachar agency fars ne mohammad saleh jokaar ke hawaale se kaha ki iran kii misile do hajaar kilometre tak ja sakati hai or kshetra main kisi bhi thikaane par hamalaa kar sakati hai
 Significantly, Trump trumped the US from the nuclear deal with Iran during Barack Obama's government
 isse iran ke upar phir se aarthik pratibandh lagu ho gayi the
 Since then, the tension between the two countries has been increasing

 NGT ne vaayu pradooshan se jude maamle par sunwaayee ke dauraan kaha ki dilli main pradooshan ko lekar halaat bad se badtar hote ja rahe hai, lekin aapke paas abhi bhi isse nipatane ke liye koi ection plan nahin he
 Significantly, on the last hearing on pollution, the NGT sought an action plan from the Delhi government and the neighboring states of Delhi
 aaj kii sunwaayee main baaki ke rajyon ne toshanghthko apane yahaan pradooshan se nipatane ko lekar ection plan de diya, lekin dilli sarkaar apana ection plan dene main vifal rahi, jisaseenghthnaraz tha
 The NGT said that Delhi's Abo Hawa is getting worse day by day and the worst effect is on children, but the government is not ready to deal with the situation
 ngtne dilli sarkaar ko 48 ghante kaa vakt diya he, jisamen dilli sarkaar ko court ko apana ection plan saunpna hoga
 The NGT will hear the case again on 6 December
 sunwaayee ke dauraan firozshah me ho rahe test match ko lekar bhi sawaal uthaa ki khatarnaak str tak pahunche pradooshan ke baad bhi match karaayaa ja rahaa he, lekintenghthne kaha ki ye tay karnaa athurity (bcci)kaa kaam he ki match hona chahie yaa nahin
 What steps the government is taking to reduce pollution in the city is very important
 isse pehlekhanghthdilli sarkaar ke pradooshan ko kam karne ke liye ivan-od ko lagu karne kii yojana ko brake laga chukaa he
 The NGT made it clear that the government would have to either include two-wheelers and women in even-od
 sirf akele kaaron par ivan-od lagu karke kya hasil hoga
 Now in such a situation, it is double difficult for the government that if even-od applies to everyone, then it does not have enough buses to provide transport to the people and if it does not implement then what to do in the action plan at present Pollution can be reduced somewhat

 arun jetali manahani maamle main vakil ram jethmalani ko sarkari khajaane se karodon rupye fees dene ke vivaad par chuppi todate hue arvind kejariwal ne virodhiyon par hamalaa kiya he
 CM Kejriwal arrived in Delhi's Seemapuri area to participate in the public meeting to campaign in the MCD elections
 arvind kejariwal ne bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'didisie membehut bhrashtachar tha
 Children playing cricket used to bring complaints that selection is not done if bribe is not given
 bhrashtachar khatm karne ke liye maine iske upar jaanch baitha di, lekin bijepi waalon ne mere upar cese karvaa diya
 So i did the biggest lawyer Ram Jethmalani, so these people started saying that why the government will pay the fees of Ram Jethmalani, now if the government does not give the fees to the public, will i give it? These people want to weaken the fight for corruption
 'isse pehle vivaad badhane par dipti siem manish sisodiya ne bhi media ke saamne aakar kaha tha ki 'is maamle ko uthaane kii timming par sawaal uthte hai

 'kejariwal par fine laga to koun degaa?jethmalani kii fees ke masale par soshal media par bhi khub chatkhaare liye ja rahe hai
 Film actor Paresh Rawal tweeted and questioned that this is the situation

 They should fight this case for free
 lalu ne kaha, 'jethmalani ne to hamaare itane cese lade or kabhi hamase paisa nahin liya
 'it is worth mentioning that Ram Jethmalani is currently a Rajya Sabha MP and RJD has sent him to Rajya Sabha
 manahani rakam se bhi zyada ho jaaegi fees!media reports ke anusaar, ram jethmalani ne kejariwal ko 3
 Billed 8 crore rupees
 iske tahat unhone ek karod rupee rettenrship ke or 22 lakh prayek peshi ke maange hai
 Accordingly, this case for Kejriwal will be costlier than the compensation demanded by Jaitley
 arun jetali ne apni chhavi ko kharaab karne kaa aarope lagaate hue arvindakejariwal se 10 karod rupee maange hanjethmalani ke ek peshi ke 22 lakh rupee ke hisaab se to puure cese ke dauraan unka bill 10 karod ke paar chalaa jayega
 Jethmalani, for example, has a fee of Rs 22 lakh
 yani agar 30 baar peshi hoti he to yah rakam 6
 6 crores will be Rs
 is tarah kul rakam 10 karod rupee se upar ho jaaegi
 However, lawyer Jethmalani has said that he is ready to serve his poor clients free of cost and there has been no response from Kejriwal

 Like Assam, the number of Muslims in the rest of the country has increased while the number of Hindus has been recorded
 viechpi netaa ne kaha, 'ye beshak hindu samaaj ke liye ek khatra he
 This is the right time to be alert to the danger of conversion

 america technology diggaj aipal kaa market vailu pehali baar 900 billian dollar ho gaya
 With this, Apple became America's first $ 900 billion company
 haalanki aisa kuch der ke liye hi hua, lekin isse ab aisa lag rahaa he jaise aane vaale samay main aipal america kii pehali 1 trillian dollar company banane ke raah par he
 Why did it happen that the company has been worth $ 900 billion for some time? The answer is the iphone X, which is being discussed a lot around the world right now
 iphone x kii bharat main shuruaati keemat 89 hajaar rupee he or iske top model kii keemat 1 lakh 2 hajaar rupee he
 Sales of the iphone x began in most countries from 3 November, including India
 log lambii line lage rahe, lekin phone sirf unhen hi mila jinhone pre booking karai thi
 This happened not only in India but also in other countries
 iphone x ko duniya bhar main behtareen rispons mil rahaa he or mahange hone ke baavjood bhi isaki bikri record str par pahunch gai
 Apparently, iphone x sales increased, which means profits for the company
 bikri demand kii vajah se company kaa market vailu pehali baar 900 million dollar ho gaya
 Not only is the sale of iphone x frozen and happening, but the iphone x is also winning in the review
 yani iphone x ko saraahaa ja rahaa he or zyaadaatar positive rivyuu mil rahe hai
 Because of this, Apple fans want to buy it, despite being expensive
 gauratlab he ki iphone 8 or iphone 8 Plus kii bharat sahit dusaremulkon main isaki bikri feeki thi
 There were two reasons for this - first, that there was nothing more than the iphone 7 and the second reason is that the iphone X, which is a futuristic iphone, is waiting for its sale
 logon ko iphone x kaa intjaar tha or company ne bhi shaayad aisi hi planning kii hogi
 According to business experts, Apple now needs only a 11 per cent jump to become a trillion dollar company
 timahi rigelt main aipal ke share 3 fisadi bade hai
 Investors of the company are excited to see the good reviews the iphone x is getting and the long line of customers which is beneficial for the company
 bloomberg ke mutabik aipal ke share is saal iphone x kii ummid par lagbhag 50 fisadi tak chadhe hai

 The government has shown
 hamane antariksh main 300 kimi dur jab live satellite ko apane anti-satellite missile se maar giraaya to unako (rahul gandhi) yah samaj me hi nahin aayaa ki hua kya he
 When we were talking about ASAT, he was talking about theater set
 jo log saboot maangate hai, main 130 karod logon se poochta hum, unhen saboot yaa sapoot chahie, jinhen saboot chahie, vah sapoot ke parakram par sawaal khadaa kar rahe hai
 When i was 8 years old, the Gandhi family has been moving out of poverty
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that when i was 8-10 years old, i used to hear that the government was talking about poverty alleviation
 jab 20-22 saal kaa hua to indira gandhi kaa naaraa suna tha, garibi hataao
 Even in subsequent generations, the Congress names kept talking about poverty removal, but poverty did not disappear

 AIADMK mlas can agree to make Jayalalithaa the leader and chief minister of the party in a few days
 kuch hi dinon main nae cabinet ke saath unki tajposhi bhi ho sakati he
 From the equation that is sitting amidst all these political ups and downs, it is also being speculated that Jayalalithaa is in the mood to hold the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu ahead of time
 court se jayalalita ko ayogy ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he, aise menmukhyamantri pad kii shapathlene ke 6 maheene ke bheetar hi unhen vidhayak kaa chunaav ladakar jeetna anivaary hoga
 Tamil Nadu assembly elections are also going to be held within a year, in such a situation Jayalalitha would not like to contest twice in public elections within 6 months
 raajnneetik panditon kii maane to iskaa ek bada kaaran yah bhi ho saktaa he ki jayalalita janata se mil rahi sahanubhuti ko bhi jald se jald bhunaa lenaa chahengi
 In the case of disproportionate assets, Jayalalithaa was given a big relief by the Karnataka High Court on Monday
 court ne vishesh adaalat ke us faisle ko khaarij kar diya tha, jisamen purv mukhyamantri ko 4 saal kaid kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 However, what is going on in Jayalalithaa's mind is not yet clear because since the High Court verdict, she has not yet met any of the party's top leaders even from Panneerselvam, who resigned as Chief Minister
 They have not even met

 isi kadi main kaha ja rahaa he ki unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi se mulaakaat kii he
 But the moment his meeting with PM is being talked about
 us dauraan prashanth kishor ne modi se kahin zyada mulaakaat congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi se kii he
 In such a situation, he will work with Modi again, it seems that the power is low
 prashanth kishor ke kareebi ne ajtak se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki kisi se mulaakaat kaa ye matlab ye nahin he ki prashanth unka prachaar sanbhaalane ja rahe hai
 The meeting with the PM is being touted, while Prashant Kishor has met rahul-priyanka many times
 unhone bataaya ki agast main cancer ke chalateprashanth kii maa kaa nidhanho gaya, jabaki unke pita kaaphi biimaar chal rahe hai, isliye wo in dinon kisi party ke liye kaam nahin kar rahe
 He is already in the work of the YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh, which his team is watching
 kareebi kaa kahana he ki piem,rahul yaa priyankamilne ke liye prashanth ko bulaayenge to koi kaise manaa kar degaa
 Be it PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka Gandhi, all of them ask Prashant Kishore on political condition and future strategy, then they say their point
 iskaa matlab ye nahin he ki wo unke saath 2019 ke liye jud gaye hai
 According to Prashant's close, the Congress is winning in Karnataka
 2014 ke lihaaj se bijepi 2019 main bijepi acha nahin karne ja rahi
 However, those close to Prashant also say that it is only after the Karnataka elections that the real picture of 2019 will begin to be clear
 unhone kaha ki 2019 ke chunaav main ramamandir banane kaa mudda or bharat-pakistan ke bich tanaav bhare maahaul kaa phayda bijepi ko nahin milegaa
 Because in 2014, the youth voted for Modi for employment and farmers and poverty for their better future
 aise main ramamandir or pakistan ke mudde par log modi ko vot nahin denge
 The news of working with the BJP for 2019 was described by people close to Prashant as completely misleading
 saath hi kaha ki, mulaakaat ko badha chadhaakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 This means that Prashant Kishore has met PM Modi, which he is not refusing
 par 2019 main bijepi ke sang kaam karenge ise lekar abhi koi faisla nahin liya gaya he
 a side in the Ayodhya case has sparked controversy over the presidency of the Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad and Mahant Gyandas of Hanumangarhi, the main plaintiff, has claimed that he is still the president of the apex unit of Hindu saints
 gyaandas ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ‘main ab bhi akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad kaa kanoonee or asal adhyaksh hum tathaa 30 janvari tak main sabit kar duungaa ki koun bahumat main or koun alpamat main he
 His remarks came after a meeting of council members held in Allahabad on Friday in which new officials were elected
 gyaandas ne aarope lagaaya ki nirmal akhaade ke balavant singh ko akhaada parishad kaa adhyaksh chunaa janaa avaidh he
 Council spokesman Ramanand Puri had said, 'in the All India Akhara Parishad meeting, Balwant Singh of Nirmal Akhara was unanimously elected as the council president and Shankaranand Giri of Anand Akhara as general secretary
 ’ niranjani akhaade se sambandhit or haridwar main mansa devi mandir trust ke pradhan pujari puri ne kaha ki june or aavahan akhaade ko chhodkar parishad ke ang sabhi 13 akhaadon ne baithak main bhaag liya
 Mahant Gyanadas, however, said 'what was the hurry that the council was disbanded without any agenda and new officers were elected
 yah sab jodtod se kiya gaya he na ki baithak se
 Contrary to the 'he said' tradition, neither me nor the council's secretary were called to attend the meeting
 ’ gyaandas ne aarope lagaaya ki yah baadha un logon dwaara khadi kii ja rahi he jo ram mandir andolan ke naam par apni ‘dukandaaree chalaa rahe hai’ or jo ayodhya vivaad ke shantipurna samaadhaan ke khilaaf hai
 He alleged that the efforts of amicable settlement of the controversial issue (ayodhya dispute) were not liked by political people and others like it
 ’ gyaandas ne kaha ki shuukravaar kii baithak main shaamil hue do padaadhikariyon upaadhyaksh mitra prakaash singh or koshadhyaksh jagatar muni ne pichley saal apane padon se istipha de diya tha
 Mahant said, 'he (singh and Muni) resigned in November last year and i have copies of his resignation
 ’ unhone kaha ki ram mandir mudde ke sauhardpurn samaadhaan ke liye jari koshishon par akhaada parishad ke aantarik maamalon ke ghatnakram kaa koi asar nahin padegaa

 saath hi mulaayam ne kaha ki ramgopal ke bulaae adhiveshan main party netaaon or mantriyon ke shaamil hone ko bhinushasanheentamana jayega

 Counting is currently underway
 raajnneetik jaankaron kii maane to congress ke liye yah nattejey hairaan karne vaale hai
 Because when the 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections are compared, Amethi's vote bank is slipping from the hands of Congress
 2014 main rahul ko 2009 ke mukaable 25 pratishat vot kam mili the
 At the same time, when it comes to the assembly elections, the Congress and the SP fought in an alliance
 iske baavjood amethi kii 5 main se 4 siten bijepi ne jiti thi or congress kaa khaataa tak nahin khulaa tha

 The BJP has released a video questioning the action against the accused in the Kathua gang rape and murder case
 bijepi kii jammu-kashmir unit ne website or twitor handle par is video ko post kiya he
 The role of some BJP mlas and ministers in Jammu and Kashmir was severely criticized after the gang rape in Kathua was exposed

 The BJP released the video just a month after two of its ministers resigned from the Jammu and Kashmir cabinet
 maaloom ho ki bijepi ke in mantriyon kokethua kandake aropiyon ke samarthan main nikaali gai raily main shaamil hone ke aarope main apane pad se istipha dena padaa tha
 It is believed that the resignation of these BJP ministers came to the fore in order to carry forward the alliance with PDP
 vahiin, aropiyon kii ore se maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karaane kii maang kii ja rahi he, jabaki mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti or unki party jammu-kashmir police kii jaanch kaa purajor samarthan kar rahe hai
 Apart from this, the Supreme Court is also hearing to transfer the case out of Jammu and Kashmir
 ab supreme court is par somvaar ko sunwaayee karegaa
 BJP said big disclosure in Kathua case
 BJP has posted this video titled 'big disclosure in Kathua case'
 is video main edwocket monica aroda maamle main krime branch kii jaanch par sawaal uthaati dikh rahi hai
 Apart from this, bjp's IT cell has appealed to people to share this video on social sites through whatsapp groups
 monica aroda us panchasadasyeey independent timka hissaa hai, jo maamle main tathyon ko jutaney ke liye haal hi main jammu kaa daura kiya tha
 The team included retired district judge Meera Khadakkar from Nagpur, journalist Sarjana Sharma from Kashmir, Sonali Chitalkar, assistant professor of political science at Delhi University's Miranda House, and social activist Monica Agarwal
 team ne apni report ko kendriya mantri jitendra singh ko saunp diya he
 The team in its report recorded the statements of the family of the accused and their lawyer Ankur Sharma
 iske alaava maamle main jammu-kashmir police ko court main chargeshit daakhil karne se rokane vaale baar association ke bayaan ko bhi darj kiya gaya he
 However the team did not meet the victim's family and the Muslim Bakarwal community
 is baat ko team ne apni report main bhi darj nahin kiya
 Jammu and Kashmir BJP spokesperson Sunil Sethi said that the team has also submitted its report to Minister of State Jitendra Singh in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO)
 jitendra singh ne is babat report saunpane kii tasviir bhi fasebuk par share kii he
 This team has justified the investigation of CBI in the case
 kya pakistan ke mashhoor purv cricketer or rajaneta imran khan kaa apni teesri bivi bushara maneka se is kadar jhagada ho gaya he ki wo imran kaa ghar chhodkar chali gayi? pakistan se lekar bharat, tamaam duniya main ye khabar jangal kii aag kii tarah fail gai
 If this news is in the headlines on newspapers, TV, web portals, there is a lot of chattering about it on social media too
 darasal, shaadi tuutane kii jo vajah bataai gai wo bhi hairaan karne vaali he
 Imran Khan's pet dogs are said to be the root of the quarrel
 Some friends must be annoyed at Imran Khan third wedding as how many times they have to give him wedding gifts
 - Amit Kumar (@amitkumarz) February 18, 2018 Hat-trick now confirmed !!! # imrankhan - Salman Hassan (@ salmanhassan77) Tried to reach the bottom
 bushara maneka ke islamabad ke posh ilaake ‘bani galaa’ main imran ke aaleeshaan ghar ko chhod kar chale jane kii peeche ek or vajah bhi bataai gai
 He is a son of Bushra Maneka, who was living in the throat for a long time, which Imran did not like
 kaha ye ja rahaa he ki nikaah ke vakt ye tay hua tha ki bushara ke bachche lambe samay tak imran ke ghar main nahin rahenge
 Disturbed by the pet dogs, please give the impression that the first newspaper newspaper 'rozana Ummat' released this report quoting sources on its website
 ‘rojaanaa ummat or ‘times of islamabad’ kii khabaron ke mutabik bushara ke jane ke baad imran khan kepalatu kuttefir se ghar main dekhe gaye hai jinhen pehle bushara ke kehane par vahaan se dur bhej diya gaya tha
 According to the news, Bushra was upset because of the dogs because he is a religious Khatoon and it was disturbing in his spiritual routine
 
 This is Bushra's second marriage and Imran's third
 donon kii shaadi kaa elaan isi saal 18 farvari ko kiya gaya tha
 Bushra has five children from her first marriage
 imran khan kii pehali shaadi jemima goldsmith or duusari shaadi reham khan se hui thi
 His first marriage lasted only nine years and his second marriage was only 10 months
 pakistani media kii reports ke mutabik bushara ke naaraaz hokar ghar se chale jane kii afvaahon ko isliye bhi hawa mili kyonki imran ke ghar main unki bahanon ko bhi dekha gaya he jo imran or bushara kii shaadi se sakht naaraaz thim
 The news of the rejects by the close people The second stance of this whole story came when 'aaj Tak' reporter in Islamabad Hamza Amir spoke to people close to Imran Khan
 unhone is khabar ko bebuniyaad bataaya
 After all, to find out what the truth is, the reporter proceeded with the investigation
 pehle ye pataa lagane kii koshish kii kya bushara islamabad main imran kaa ghar chhodane ke baad apane maayke pahunchin yaa nahin
 Bushra's camp is in Pakpatan in Punjab, Pakistan
 lekin bushara ke vahaan pahunchane kii bhi pushti nahin hui
 Not only this, the Pakistani newspaper 'rozana Ummat', which had published a report of Bushra leaving home after getting angry, has been sent notice by Imran Khan's party 'pakistan tehreek-e-insaf' (PTI)
 is notice ke mutabik 22 april ko website par imran khan kii nijee jindagi ke bare membebuniyaad khabar chhapihe jiskaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 The notice stated that before printing such news, neither had any conversation with Imran Khan nor was anyone asked
 notice me ye bhi kaha gaya he ki is par maafee nahin maangi gai to karrwai kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahen
 After the investigation of the reporter for the viral test in Pakistan and talking to all the people, the same can be said that the news spread about Imran and Bushra is not confirmed at least
 (islamabad se hamaja amir ke input ke saath) The controversy that began after the screening of the Malayalam film 'S Durga' at the Indian International Film Festival (IFFI) was halted
 ab iefeai ne film dekhne ke baad apni report sarkaar ko bheji he

 The court had said in its order that a certified copy of the film could be screened at the festival starting Monday
 dharmik bhavanaaen bhadakne ke dar se yahaan 'naamanzoor' hui film, nirdeshak ne kaha- bharat iran jaisaasutron ke mutabik, s Durga film kaa naam ab badalane se koi fark nahin padataakyonki juri ke paas jab film bheji gayi thi tab uskaa naam Sexy Durga hi tha
 The ministry had written a letter to Film Festival director Anupama Chopra on September 19 about not showing the film at the Mumbai Film Festival
 usamen kaha gaya he ki durga hinduon kii ek pramukh devi kaa naam he or mantralay kaa maananaa he ki agar is film ko film festival main dikhaae jane kii anumati di jaati he to isse logon kii dharmik bhaawanaaon ko thes pahonchegi
 At the same time there can be a problem with law and order

 There was a time when everything was going well for the Congress
 ve bade pariwaron (unamem se ek to purv rajpariwaar kaa sadsy he) ke uttaradhikariyon ke rup main chaandi kaa chammach liye paidaa hue the, unki jamkar khatir kii gai, unki suni gai, or prashasan kaa tajurba dilwane ke liye unhen rajyamantri bhi banaaya gaya
 Now the atmosphere has changed a lot
 umr ke paanchaven dashak main kadam rakh chuke jyotiraditya sindhiya, sachin payalat, milind devda, jitin prasad tathaa deependra hooda 'peter pan syndrome' se peedit hai, or sudhaar ke liye sangharshrat dikh rahe hai
 Peter Pan was the child who refused to grow up
 congress ke purv adhyaksh 49-varshiya rahul gandhi iskaa shikhar hai
 Peter Pan was the leader of the 'lost Boys', and the loneliness and suffering of these next generation leaders is increasing so much that he will certainly be compared to Peter Pan and his 'lost Boys'
 in logon kaa koi kasoor nahin hote hue bhi inkaa utthan or patan usee tarah hua, jis tarah rahul gandhi kaa hua
 Jyotiraditya Scindia is fighting a lonely battle against the cautious and clever duo of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh, known as 'super Chief Minister'
 sindhiya ne kuch takat hasil kar paane ke liye sabhi maanya tareeke or saadhan istemaal kar liye
 In newspaper advertisements and wall-mounted hoardings, he was first demanded to be the Chief Minister, then to be the head of the party's state unit
 jyotiraditya sindhiya ke vafaadaar maane jane vaale vanmantri umang singhar ne digvijay singh ko 'blackmailer' kii sangya de daali, or un par 'sharaab kaarobaar tathaa gaiyrkanoonee ret khanan main shaamil hone' kaa aarope lagaaya
 After this statement, he also wrote a letter to the current party president Sonia Gandhi, in which he also accused Digvijay Singh of running the Madhya Pradesh government behind the scenes
 iske baad sindhiya buudhvaar ko us samay umang singhar ke samarthan main khud bhi utar aae, or kamalnath se umang kii baat or aarope sunne kaa aagrah kiya, jab sonia ne singhar kii maangon par koi pratikriya nahin di
 After losing his Guna seat in the Lok Sabha elections, Jyotiraditya Scindia was made almost irrelevant in his own stronghold
 vah party kii pradesh ikai ke adhyaksh ke rup main kamalnath kaa sthaan lenaa chaahate hai, lekin party unhen jhunjhuna hi pakadaati rahi
 When Priyanka Gandhi Vadra stepped into politics as general secretary (former Uttar Pradesh), Jyotiraditya Scindia was put in charge of western Uttar Pradesh
 jab rahul gandhi ne congress adhyaksh pad choda, tab us avasar ko upyukt samay maanakar jyotiraditya sindhiya ne aisa pad chhod dene ke liye istemaal kiya, jo vah kabhi nahin chaahate the
 The party then made him the head of the screening committee for the upcoming assembly elections in Maharashtra, and this is also something he does not want
 ab congress main yah atakalein behad garm hai ki jyotiraditya sindhiya ke saath-saath mumbai dakshin sansadeey kshetra se chunaav haar chuke milind devda bhi congress chhodkar BJP main jane kii koshish kar rahe hai, jiske liye baatcheet kaaphi aage pahunch chuki he, lekin is maukey par ise sahi samajhnaa bahut jaldbaazi hogi, lekin yah bhi spasht he ki donon netaa behad baichaiyn hai, or apane rajnatik bhavishya ko lekar chintit bhi
 In fact, ever since Sonia Gandhi and her old allies took over the reins of the party from Rahul, the pride of the old allies has been falling on the younger leaders
 unki mahatvakankshaon par gaaz girane kii vajah yah he ki sindhiya, devda or jitin prasad ne baar-baar saarvajanik rup se party se katai alag line akhriyaar kii he
 The trio and Dependra Hooda had publicly welcomed the repeal of Article 370 (abolishing special status of Jammu and Kashmir) and Jitin Prasad recently welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's idea of population control
 vishwasaneey sutron ke anusaar, jitin prasad to loksabhaa chunaav se pehle hi BJP main jane kii puri taiyaari kar chuke the, or unki yojana ke bare main media dwaara puche jane par unhone koi jawaab nahin diya tha
 It is said that a journey made in the car with Rahul Gandhi, during which he was requested to remain in the Congress, changed his mind
 lekin yah tab kii baat he
 After Rahul's departure, he again started talking to the BJP
 rajasthan kaa mukhyamantri banane kii khwaahish ko kabhi chhipaakar nahin rakhane vaale sachin payalat bhi apane swabhaav ke vipareet maujuuda afratfari main bilkul chuppi saadhe hue hai, jo aaj kii congress kii paribhaasha banakar rah gai he
 Sources say that he does not see his future in the BJP, as the BJP already has former Chief Ministers Vasundhara Raje and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Rajasthan, the favorite ministers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 so, iske bajaay vah chupchaap khud kii ek kshetreey party launch karne par vichaar kar rahe hai
 Sources close to him insisted that this is just an idea at the moment, which will take shape, depending on what the results of the upcoming assembly elections are
 congress main agali peedi ke netaa tarakkee ke avasaron ke abhaav or party ke maujuuda vaicharik atkav kii vajah se naaraaz hai
 One youth leader said, "we will keep losing the election, because the voters do not know what we are supporting
" 
 
 arthvyavastha kii kharaab sthiti ko lekar ham zamin par ek virodh pradarshan tak nahin kar sakate, kyonki hamaare paas na netritv he, na kaaryakarta
 
 
 This may be true for Rahul Gandhi, as he did not want to become a minister in Manmohan Singh's cabinet either
 
 
 ham chaahate the
 
 
 We worked hard, and we learned the ways
 
 
 ab unki gaddi ko to unki maa sanbhale baithi hai, ham kahaan jaaen
 
 
 ? "on the other hand, Dipendra Hooda comes as a package deal with his father (former Chief Minister of Haryana) Bhupendra Hooda, and his father is going to face elections from the hands of Ashok Tanwar appointed by Rahul Gandhi in Haryana
 Managed to take over
 darasal, sonia gandhi ke puraane varisht sahyogiyon ne unhen samajhaayaa, or niyantran nahin die kii sthiti main party chhodkar chale jane kaa hooda kaa blackmel kaamyaab rahaa
 This angered the young leaders, one of whom said bitterly, "to move forward in Congress, you need the name of a strong leader
 
 
 " is par party ke varisht netaaon ne bhi jawaab diya
 a colleague of Sonia Gandhi said, "we know he is angry, but will Shah make him a minister
" 
 
 ?" a case of disregard of the mandate has come up in the Uttarakhand government, in which the head of the forest department is flouting the rules
 jis pradesh main 2016 se hi yah niyam lagu he ki mukhyamantri se mahange vaahan main pradesh kaa koi bhi adhikari nahin chal saktaa, us pradesh main mukhyamantritrivendra singh rawatse badi or mahangi car main khud van vibhaag ke mukhiya chal rahe hai
 In such a situation, what can be said about the remaining officers
 haalanki ye shasnadesh 2016 main tab jari kiya gaya tha, jab pradesh main congress kii sarkaar thi or isaki kaman harish ravat ke haath main thi
 But order is order
 agar nimay-kaayda ke khilaaf kuch ho rahaa he to uske liye maujuuda sarkaar or uske mukhiya trivendra singh ravat hi jimmedaar honge
 What is the whole matter, PCCF (hoff), head of Uttarakhand Deptt
, Is running in more than 20 lakh expensive Innova (krista) car
 yah sidhe-sidhe mukhyamantri or cabinet mantriyon ke khuleam avmaananaa kaa maamla he
 On March 10, 2016, the Uttarakhand Transport Department issued an order regarding vehicles for ministers and officials
 parivahan vibhaag ke aadesh main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri, cabinet mantri, mukhya sachiv, ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayadhish, police mahanideshak va van vibhaag ke mukhiya sahit pramukh van sangrakshak str ke adhikari 15 lakh rupee tak kii car kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 But bypassing this mandate, the head of the forest department is running luxury cars like Innova Crysta, which is more than 20 lakh rupees
 yah mukhyamantri or cabinet mantriyon kaa na keval apmaan he balki avmaananaa kaa maamla bhi banataa he
 Violation of standards: According to the information, under the Uttarakhand Jyaka Project, luxury cars have been purchased contrary to the norms in violation of this mandate of Uttarakhand government
 uttarakhand sarkaar dwaara ek taraf kharch kam karne kaa dhol peeta ja rahaa he to duusari ore van vibhaag ke mukhiya isi dhol kii pole kholte hue nazar aa rahe hai
 Waiting for action In many departments of Uttarakhand, officials are running in expensive cars and flaunting orders of the transport department
 aise main shashan dwaara jari aadesh kaa kya mahatv rah jaataa he
 According to this mandate of the Uttarakhand government, the rule of one officer-one vehicle is applicable, but almost every IAS officers in the government have three-three cars
 ab aise main jiro torlance ke naam par satta main kabiz bhaajapa mukhyamantri ko dekhnaa hoga ki ve in afasaron ke khilaaf kya karrwai karte hai

 Kalam Saheb, Pranam! One day everyone has to go, so you also had to go
 is par kya ronaa-gaanaa, kya gile-shikave karnaa
 You must have wanted to stay here for a few more days so that the Nakkal middle class of this country with slave mentality can shake as much as possible
 lekin jo aapane kiya vah koi kam to nahin?aaj is desh kaa yuva agar josh se bharaa he, aashaa se labarej he, is or us nakli-asli vichaardhaara kaa shikaar hue bagaiyr bade-bade sapane dekh rahaa he, apane man kii baat bejhijak kah rahaa he, upabhokta se zyada naagarik ban rahaa he or samaaj tathaa sarkaar banane tak naye-naye prayog kar rahaa he, to is sab main aapkaa bada role he kyonki aap unke role model jo ban gaye the , hai or rahenge
 Now someone wrote that if Soniaji had allowed you to become the President again, it would have been so nice! It is absolutely mouth-watering, that is, the matter of keeping his mind, whose mind had become the heart of the people, the people and the people, and that earned the dignity of the President
 ek mosallam hindustani man jisamen ek taraf sabko swikaarne kii kshamta ho jaisaa vaidic rishi dirghatama kah gaye:akosedwipra bahudhaa vadanti ( ek hi satya ko bhinn-bhinn satyaarthee bhinn-bhinn tarah se samajhate-kehete hai)
 
 
 So on the other side, everyone has the ability to make their way by the side, as Buddha said to his beloved disciple Anand before Mahaprayana: App Deepo Bhava (be Your Own Lamp)
 jabase aapke chola-tyaag kii khabar mili he tabhi se meraa man ekadam se baua rahaa he kisi baawale kii tarah
 Had it not been for this, would i have dared to write such absurd things on this Facebook postcard? Since last night the housemates have heard me ranting: Kalam Kakka, tell me when you have gone up, you will go to Khusro and Mir's head Or that of Ramananda, Shankaracharya and Chanakya? Mahatma Buddha would not have known such a thing even though he has been on a sino-japanese visit for quite some time
 akbar or shershah to shahenshaah tehre, bhale hi kuch bole nahin lekin aap unase jaldi nahin milen to unhen bhi acha nahin lagegaa
 You will also have some professional compulsion that in such a busy schedule, there is no delay in praying even to the common people like Aryabhata, Bhaskaracharya, Varahamiheer, Charak, Sushruta
 ek pareshaani to yah bhi he ki aap mithi id ke kuch hi samay baad vahaan padhaare hai to sab sewaiyaan bhi maangenge
 Well, you will deal with this by giving someone a copy of '2020' and someone with a copy of 'flight of Fire'
 ab jab der-saber sabase aapaki mulaakaat honi tay he to sabase ek sawaal jarur kariyegaa ki idhar chandragupta, samudragupta, shershah, akbar, raja ranjit singh, subhash bose, patel or jamshed ji tata jaison kii badi demand he or supplai nahin ke baraabar he, aisa kyo? is kaaran sab jagah chines maal kii tarah phek yani nakkaalon kaa bolbalaa he
 According to me, Chanakya, Shankaracharya and Khusro will prove to be the most helpful in this work because all these are extremely India-distraught souls and will not hesitate to do anything in the interest of the country
 or ant main, ho sake to idhar jaldi aa janaa
 You are in great need
 ek qawwali yaad aa rahi he:aa gaye ho to jane kii jid naa karoja rahe ho to aane kaa vaada karo
 
 
 With best wishes, Best regards, Chandrakant Prasad Singh

 sincerely) madhya pradesh ke baitool jile main ek aisa gaanv he, jahaan maveshi paalak doodh ko bechate nahin he, balki muft main dete hai
 It may be a bit surprising to hear and read, but it is right
 lagbhag teen hajaar kii aabaadi vaale baitool jile ke chudiya gaanv main log doodh kaa vyapaar nahin karte, balki ghar main utpaadit hone vaale doodh kaa apane parivaar main upyog karte hai or jarurat se adhik utpaadit hone vaale doodh ko jaruratmandon ko muft main dete hai
 In this village, no person does the work of selling milk

 He was a Gosevak, he called upon the villagers not to sell milk and the products made from it, the villagers obeyed Baba, since then milk is not sold here

 The people of the village are still following the saying of Chindhya Baba, the houses which contain milk and those which are available are healthy, "he said," No family in the village sells milk, even if it makes curd
 If she goes, she is also distributed, she also does not deny that now those who have milk left, they take ghee from it and sell it in the market, "he said," Some family people add ghee from milk
 become Make sure they sell, "he main business is to cultivate people further explains that village, so milk is not selling does not produce economic problems of some sort in front of them
 adivasee pariwaron ke alaava lagbhag har ghar main maveshi hai or sabhi ko jarurat kaa doodh mil jaataa he, jinke yahaan zyada utpaadan hota he, ve dusron ko doodh uplabdh kara dete hai

 disambar 2008 main lagaataar duusari baar bhaajapa ko satta main laane ke turant baad unhone shashan sanchaalan main aam janata kii bhagidaari or usase sujhav lene ke liye website taiyaar karne kii manshaa jaahir kii or kareeb 20 din main hi website taiyaar hokar 19 janvari, 2009 ko shuru bhi ho gai
 Shivraj Singh says, "good ideas are not only with the officers or leaders, the general public can also suggest ways to improve the system
" isliye yah website mahatvapurn he jisase pratyaksh mili bagaiyr bahumoolya suzav liye ja sakate hai
 Seeing this website as important for good governance, the Central Government has also awarded the 2009 Silver Icon Weberton Award to the School of Good Governance and Policy Analysis in April 2010
 is website kii upyogita is tathy se hi sabit ho jaati he ki shuru hone ke pehle hi din 100 idia aa gaye or ab tak kareeb 4,800 se zyada idia mil chuke hai
 On the very next day of the website's launch, two suggestions received on January 20, 2009, two sent on January 21, 2009 and one suggestion on January 22, 2009 and two suggestions received on January 23, were implemented after due process
 
 website par milane vaale sujhaavon par amal karne ke bharose se logon kii ummid bad gai or badhiya suzav dene waalon ko sammanit kiye jane kii vyavastha ne is par sakaaratmak asar daalaa
 As a result, a large number of important suggestions started coming from almost every district of Madhya Pradesh, but also from other parts of the country and also from outside the country
 suzav dene waalon main har umr, tabake ke log hai
 For example, Kota Achutha Reddy, a resident of Hanamkonda in Warangal district in Andhra Pradesh and an engineering graduate from BITS, Pilani, suggested to create an online employment exchange to inform educated youth about employment opportunities, which was quickly accepted and implemented
 And Reddy was also honored by the Chief Minister at a function on 7 December 2010 for this suggestion
 mukhyamantri chouhan ke pramukh sachiv deepak khandekar khud saare suzav dekhte hai jabaki website kaa prabandhan bhartiya van seva ke adhikari tathaa sushasan or niti vishleshan skool main nideshak akhilesh argal ke jimme he
 On the suggestions found on the website, a meeting is held in the Chief Minister's Secretariat every 15-20 days in which Argal, Khandekar and another secretary are involved
 chune gaye sujhaavon kaa panjiyan kiya jaataa he
 Then a login id and password are sent by email so that the suggestor can know the status of his suggestion at any time
 argal bataate hai, ''sujhav milane kii soochna suzav dene vaale ko i-mail se khud-ba-khud mil jaati he or iske baad chunaa jaae yaa nahin suzav dene vaale ko suzav kii sthiti kii jaankaree bhi bhej di jaati he
 When the suggestion is rejected, an e-mail notification is given
 khandekar bataate hai, ''chaynit idia ko sambandhit vibhaag ke paas bheja jaataa he or vibhaag kii raay milane ke baad use mukhyamantri ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he
 Only then it is decided to implement it or not
 ''ahm yah ki bhale vibhaag ne kisi sujhav ko lekar nakaaratmak raay di ho lekin yadi mukhyamantri ko vah janhitkaari lagata he to us par amal ke nirdesh die jate hai
 For example, this happened in the suggestion of 63-year-old chartered accountant Radheshyam Somani of Indore
 somani ne sahakaari grih nirmaan sansthaaon main faile bhrashtachar kii jaankaree dete hue bataaya tha ki sanstha ke sadasyon ko 10 saal tak bhukhand na bechney dene ke niyam kii vajah se hi bhrashtachar hota he, jisamen puraane sadsy se bhukhand kharidne vaale shaks ko sadsyta dene ke naam par avaidhanik rakam lee jaati he
 He therefore suggested that this obligation should be abolished and the government should be allowed to sell the plots by charging transfer fees
 haalanki sahakaarita vibhaag raji nahin tha lekin mukhyamantri ne ise janhit main mahatvapurn mana or amal karne kav nirdesh die
 The land mafia and brokers should not be involved in this sale and sale, so the period was reduced from 10 years to three years, not ending this obligation completely
 7 disambar, 2010 ko chouhan ne somani ko rachanaatmak suzav dene ke liye sammanit kiya
 "such an initiative should be taken by the central government as well," says Somani
 '' reva kav 31 varshiya ajay mishra ke sujhav par bhi vibhaag kii raay ko darkinar kar mukhyamantri ne amal karaayaa
 In fact, Mishra was pained that during the counseling for the appointment of contractual school teachers, the original certificate should be kept for two months to bond these unemployed youth
 is bich unhen koi behatar avasar miltaa he to praaanpatr na hone se vah unke haath se nikal jayega
 The education department argued that if the contractual teacher moves to another job after a few days of counseling, then counseling will have to be done again and again
 is par mukhyamantri kaa kahana tha ki yadi behatar avasar mili to kyon unhen majaboor kiya jaae

 However the lack of publicity of this website has been felt and no more important suggestions affecting policy making have been found
 iske alaava kai logon ne ise shikaayat kaa madhyam samaj liya
 Although the website clearly states that for complaints www
 mpsamdhan
 use org
 isiilie ab tak mili sujhaavon main se sirf 421 hi maane gaye or baaki ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 Of the 421 suggestions registered, 331 were canceled after the opinion of the departments as many of them were already implemented or it was not possible to implement them
 argal kehete hai, ''haalanki logon ko protsaahit karne ke liye saamaanya sujhav bhi shuru main sweekaar kar liye gaye lekin hamen mahatvapurn sujhaavon kii pratiksha he
 "the result of this is that in the first round, only 12 suggestions were implemented
" 2009 ke baad koi suzav ab tak amal main nahin laayaa gaya
 Tiwari feels that "much attention was given in the initial phase, now there is some laxity"
 '' lekin khandekar kehete hai, ''42 sujhaavon par vibhaagon ne ab tak raay nahin bheji he, 34 sujhaavon par vibhaagon kii raay mil gai he jin par mukhyamantri ke saath jaldi hi baithak kar faisla kiya jayega
 "argal says," The same important suggestions are received in a month, but if it is a policy determinant then the website will have a positive effect

 How deep the roots of casteism in many areas of Bihar can be gauged from a school register
 skool ko shiksha kaa mandir kaha jaataa he lekin purvi champaran ke tenua ucch vidhyalay main alag- alag jati ke bacchon ke alag-alag register banaae gaye hai
 This school was established in 1952, 678 students are studying here, but Kamlesh Kumar, in charge of the school, has made a separate register of all categories of children and divided the class
 kaksha- 9 main 7 section banaae gaye hai- e,bi,si,di,i,epa,ji
 This register has been made according to the backward caste, extremely backward, scheduled caste and general caste in the government records

 When it was tried to get information about the whole matter and the methods of class division from the school principal, they refused to say anything, but the argument given by the school clerk is shocking
 clerk ne kaha ki sarkaar chaatr chaatraon kii vibhinn yojanaayen jaise steepend dress cycle yojanaon ke liye jatigat suchi maangati he, sarkaar ko yah aankade sthaayee taur par mili isliye aisi vyavastha kii gai he
 He also says that this system has been in operation for the last several years
 yah vyavastha kai varshon se chali aa rahi he lekin ilaake ke adhikariyon ko isaki jaankaree nahi he
 Kalyanpur BDO Vineet Kumar says that this is a serious matter, it has come to the notice

 shouri ne kaha modi desh kii arthvyastha ko thik se nahin chalaa paa rahe or unhen alpsankhyakon par ho rahe jubaani hamalon par bhi aankh munde rakhane ke liye bhi jimmedaar tehraaya
 Shourie also criticized Modi for wearing a 10-lakh suit during a meeting with Barack Obama
 modi sarkaar kii pehali saalagirah ke maukey par shouri ne 'hedlins today' ko exclusive intervyuu diya or kaha ki bijepi ko narendra modi, amit shah or arun jetali kii trimurti chalaa rahi he
 Shourie handled the ministries of communications, information and direct investment in the first NDA government
 vaajapeyi ke daur main ve bijepi ke sabase kaddavar netaaon main gine jate the, lekin modi sarkaar main unhen koi jagah nahin mili
 When Shourie was asked that the Modi government has made enough efforts for 8 per cent growth rate, which can go up to 10 per cent quickly, Shourie said, 'all is superlative'
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke daawey sirf surkhiyaan batorne ke liye jate hai, lekin inamen vaastaviktaa nahin hoti
 Shourie said, "instead of bringing the policies to the right end, the government is more focused on staying in the headlines
 ' unhone baraak obama ke saath mulaakaat ke saath dauraan pradhanmantri ke us suut pahanane ko bhi unki badi galati bataaya, jisamen har jagah modi kaa chote-chote aksharon main naam likhaa tha
 Significantly, the Prime Minister was heavily criticized for this suit and later he was auctioned for the Ganga cleanliness campaign
 shouri ne kaha, 'main samaj nahin paaya ki modi ne wo suut kyon sweekaar kiya
 You cannot wear such things with Gandhi's name

 AK Antony said at a function of Transparency International, 'corruption is a problem
 haalanki hamaare gambhir prayaason ke baavjood janata main yah dharna ban gayi he ki sarkaar bhrashtachar mitaane ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 However, our government is serious on this issue and the introduction of the RTI Act proved this
 ’unhone kaha, ‘artiai kanoon ab bhi shuruaati str par he or mujhe vishwaas he ki kuch saalon main har jagah gopneeyata kii diwaar kamjor pad jaaegi
 Due to RTI, no organization can hide its acts under the pretext of secrecy
 isse bhrashtachar samaapt hone main madad milegi
 'many scams that have surfaced in the last few years have shaken the UPA government, including 2G spectrum allocation, coal allocation, helicopter scam and the Railway Ministry bribery
 raksha kshetra main bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye sarkaar dwaara uthaaye gayi kadamon par tippanee karte hue unhone kaha, ‘hamen jab bhi shikaayat milti he, ham unhen koodaydaan main nahin phenk dete
 Whenever someone is found guilty, we take serious action after proper investigation
 ’raksha mantri ne kaha, ‘ham kisi shikaayat kii andekhi nahin kar sakate
 We do not spare anyone guilty
 raksha vibhaag bahut khulaa he isliye zyada shikaayatein aa raheen hai
 If someone messes up, something will come up immediately

 ’ unhone kaha ki raksha kharid hameshaa vivaadon se ghiri rahati he or intigrity pact ke shaamil hone se bhrashtachar ko samaapt karne main madad milti he
 Antony said, 'nothing is permanent
 intigrity pact bhi nahin
 There are some vendors who are looking for new ways to get rid of the integrity pact and we have to strengthen the agreement to make sure there are no flaws
 ’ mantri ne bhrashtachar ko rokane ke liye kharid main swatantra bahari nigaraneekartaaon (iiem) kii sanstha kii jarurat par bhi jor diya
 He said, "iems should be experts in related fields and CVC will have to play an important role in this

 '-input IANS Finance Bill 2017 was introduced by the Finance Minister in the Lok Sabha on 1 February, which was discussed on 21 March and 22 March and legalized the amendments and provisions suggested in it
 iske tahat jo sanshodhan paas hue hai use lekar sansad se baahar sawaal kiya ja rahaa he
 dailiyo
 in ek website he, is par meghnath es naam ke research ne likhaa ki kis tarah media ne aam janata se jude is mahatvapurn vidheyak ke bare main thik se reporting nahin kii
 Even those reporting to Parliament did not think it necessary to convey information about it to the people
 meghnath ne ek dilachasp vakya sunaaya
 On March 21, when the Finance Bill was under discussion, 9 mps of several parties involved in the discussion spoke
 is vakt tak kisi bhi tivi channel ne is charchaa ke kisi bhi ansh ko dikhaanaa zaruri nahin samajha
 Meghnath writes that as soon as Chief Minister Adityanath Yogi woke up to speak on the Finance Bill itself, the channels started showing that speech
 jis vakt bol rahe the usee vakt loksabhaa tivi par neeche kii pattee main soochna chal rahi thi ki vitt vidheyak par charchaa chal rahi he
 The Chief Minister started his speech by saying that i am thankful to you, Mr
 President, you have given me an opportunity to say two words on the Finance Bill
 lekin unke bhaashan ko aap bhi loksabhaa kii website par jaakar dekhiye
 Only then will you know which part of his speech is related to the provisions of the Finance Bill
 mujhe to ek bhi hissaa nahin laga phir bhi aapako khud se bhi dekhnaa chahie
 There was no reporting of what he said on the subject on which Yogi ji was supposed to speak
 unase pehle nau saansad or yogi ji ke baad chah saansadon ne bolaa is par bhi nahin hui
 That night, you should remember that Yogi ji was on TV
 meghnath ke lekh kaa masauda yahi he ki media ne aakhir kaise itane bade masale ko yogi ji ke bhaashan se kam mahatvapurn samajha
 a number of amendments to this Finance Bill were introduced at the last minute which are related to political donations and their transparency, the tribunal for settlement of disputes of all departments and their appointment process
 isi ke tahat nagdi len dein ko teen lakh se ghataakar do lakh kar diya gaya he
 All these should be discussed separately but we would like to keep today's topic related to Aadhaar
 ek july 2017 se iskar ritern bharne or pan number ke liye aadhaar number dena anivaary ho jayega
 Income tax returns will no longer be filed without Aadhaar
 jis kisi ke paas pan card he use ek july tak aadhaar number dena hoga
 If you do not do this then the PAN card will become invalid
 mana jayega ki aapke paas pan card yaa pan number nahin he
 Many questions have been raised again with Aadhaar being made mandatory in income tax form and PAN number
 2009 se lekar 2017 ke bich aadhaar ke istamaal ko lekar, iske li hone se lekar anivaary kiye jane ke khatare ko lekar kai bahasein suni, pachaason lekh padhe
 On the other hand we have seen in society that there is a lot of enthusiasm about the base
 zyaadaatar raajnneetik dal ke kaaryakarta aadhaar card ko matadaata pahchaan patr kii tarah banavaane main jute rahete hai
 It is often said that this threatens your privacy
 yaad kiijie, jab aap aadhaar card banane gaye tab kya kisi ne aapako bataaya tha ki ise kaise sambhaal kar rakhana he, kise dena he kise nahin dena he, agar yah li ho gaya to kya hoga
 Did you ask main galat ho saktaa hum magar phir bhi aapse kuch sawaal hai
 Do you understand the meaning of privacy? Do you think its privacy should be maintained? Do you think that the government knows everything about you? Do you think that your Aadhaar number is also with private companies? Do you know what will happen if the Aadhaar number is leaked? loktantr ko khatara to tab bhi he jab aadhaar nahin he, aadhaar hone ke baad isaki soochna kisi raajnneetik dal, company ke paas jane ke baad aapako kis tarah kaa khatara ho saktaa he kya aap is sawaal ko mahatv dete hai? mujhe lagata he aadhaar ko lekar aapmen se zyaadaatar bilkul pareshaan nahin hai
 That's why 112 crore Indians made Aadhaar cards with full enthusiasm
 aisa nahin ki isaki aalochana yaa khatre ko lekar akhabaaron main lekh nahin chape
 There is hardly any discussion on TV but rightly
 aadhaar ko anivaary banaaye jane ke aalochakon kii ek baat ke liye tarif karnaa chahta hum
 They were criticizing even when the arrival of Aadhaar was coming and are still doing it when more than one hundred crore Indians have taken Aadhaar numbers
 duusari taraf sarkaar hameshaa aadhaar ko lekar aashwast nazar aati he
 If critics have a point, then why do not all political parties speak against it
 sansad main hi kyon bolte hai
 Why don't you come out of Parliament and speak among you
 ek sawaal khud se or aam logon se he
 Do any documents give us psychological protection in the name of identity and for this security we are ready to lose the security which we do not realize, someone else has
 pan card, rashan card driving license, jati pramaan patr, janm pramaan patr ,matadaata pahchaan patr aadi ityadi pahachaanon ke anek patron vaale is desh ke nagarikon ko aadhaar number main aisa kya dikhaa
 The Supreme Court has said many times that Aadhaar should not be made mandatory
 magar sarkaar ise kaph syrup ke rup main tamaam yojanaon main shaamil karti ja rahi he
 Pension, Scholarship, EPFO, Ration Card, Driving License, Mobile Number, Midday Mill, PAN Number, Income Tax Return, Land Purchase Sale
 kya vaaki jahaan jahaan aadhaar pahunchaa he vahaan vahaan se bhrashtachar khatm hua he
 When the UPA was praising it, the BJP was describing it as being a hoax to the public
 ab bijepi ise kai chizon main anivaary kar rahi he to sadan ke bheetar congress aadhaar ke khatare uthaa rahi he
 Aadhar is mandatory in driving license, mobile number, PAN card, income tax return
 meghnath likhte hai ki jaise hi vitt vidheyak par hi bolne ke liye mukhyamantri adityanath yogi uthe, channelon ne us bhaashan ko dikhaanaa shuru kar diya
 At the time when he was speaking, information was going on in the bottom bar on Lok Sabha TV that the Finance Bill was being discussed
 mukhyamantri ne apane bhaashan kii shuruuaat hi is baat se kii ki adhyaksh ji main aapkaa abhaari hum, aapane mujhe vitt vidheyak par do shabd kehane kaa avasar pradaan kiya he
 But see his speech on the website of Lok Sabha too
 tabhi aap jaan paayenge ki unke bhaashan kaa koun sa hissaa vitt vidheyak ke praavdhaanon se sambandhit he
 i did not feel a single part, yet you should see it by yourself
 jis vishay par yogi ji ko bolnaa tha, us vishay par unhone kya bolaa isaki koi reporting nahin hui
 Before him, nine mps and after Yogi ji, six mps did not even speak on this
 us raat aap yaad karen tivi par yogi ji hi chaaye hue the
 The draft of Meghnath's article is how the media considered such a big issue less important than Yogi's speech
 is vitt vidheyak main kai sanshodhan aakiri vakt main pesh kiye gaye jinka sambandh raajnneetik chandon or unki paardarshita se he, tamaam vibhaagon ke vivaadon ke niptaare ke liye bane tribunel or unki niyukti prakriya se he
 Under this, the cash transaction has been reduced from three lakhs to two lakhs
 in sab par alag se charchaa honi chahie magar ham aaj ke vishay ko aadhaar se sambandhit hi rakhana chahenge
 With effect from July 1, 2017, it will be mandatory to fill Aadhaar number and provide Aadhaar number for PAN number
 bina aadhaar ke ab iskar ritern nahin bharaa ja sakegaa
 Anyone who has a PAN card will have to provide an Aadhaar number by July 1
 agar aisa nahin karenge to pan card avaidh ho jayega
 It is assumed that you do not have a PAN card or PAN number
 iskar farm or pan number main aadhaar ko anivaary kiye jane se kai sawaal phir se uthe hai
 Between 2009 and 2017, i heard many debates about the use of Aadhaar, the risk of it being leaked and mandated, read fifty articles
 duusari taraf hamane samaaj main dekha ki aadhaar ko lekar gazab kaa utsaah he
 Most political party workers are busy making Aadhaar card like voter ID card
 aksar kaha jaataa he ki isse hamaari aapaki privesi ko khatara he
 Remember, when you went to make an Aadhaar card, did anyone tell you how to handle it, whom to give, whom not to give, what would happen if it was leaked
 kya aapane poocha tha
 i may be wrong but you still have some questions
 kya aap privesi yani niztaa kaa matlab samajhate hai? kya aap samajhate hai ki isaki gopneeyata bani rahani chahie? kya aap samajhate hai ki aapaki har baat sarkaar jane? kya aap samajhate hai ki aapkaa aadhaar number privet companiyon ke paas bhi ho? kya aap jaanate hai ki aadhaar number li ho gaya to kya hoga?tippaniyan The danger to democracy is there even when there is no Aadhaar, after being Aadhaar, what kind of danger can you face after going to a political party, company, do you value this question? i think most of you are not bothered about Aadhaar at all
 tabhi to 112 karod bharatiyon ne puure utsaah ke saath aadhaar card banwaaya
 It is not that newspaper articles were not published about its criticism or danger

 i would like to praise one of the critics for making Aadhaar mandatory
 ye tab bhi aalochana kar rahe the jab aadhaar kaa aagaman ho rahaa tha or ab bhi kar rahe hai jab sau karod se adhik bharatiyon ne aadhaar number le liye hai
 On the other hand, the government always seems confident about Aadhaar
 agar aalochakon kii baat main dam he to kyon nahin tamaam raajnneetik dal iske khilaaf bolte hai
 Why speak in Parliament itself
 sansad se baahar aapke bich aakar kyon nahin bolte hai
 One question is from ourselves and common people
 kya hamen pahchaan ke naam par koi bhi dastauez manovaigyanik suraksha detaa he or apni is suraksha ke liye ham wo suraksha bhi ganvaane ke liye taiyaar he jiskaa ahsaas hamen nahin he, kisi or ko he
 What do the Aadhaar numbers show to the citizens of this country with multiple identity cards like PAN card, ration card driving license, caste certificate, birth certificate, voter ID card, etc
 supreme court ne kai baar kaha he ki aadhaar ko anivaary nahin banaaya janaa chahie
 But the government is going to include it in all schemes in the form of cough syrup
 pension, scolership, ipiefo, rashan card, driving license, mobile number, mid de mil, pan number, iskar ritern, zamin kareed bikri
 Is corruption really over where Aadhaar has reached? upie jab isaki tarif kar rahi thi tab bijepi ise janata se kiya ja rahaa dhokhaa bataa rahi thi
 Now the BJP is making it compulsory in many things, so the Congress is taking the risk of base within the House
 driving license, mobile number, pan card, iskar ritern sabamein aadhaar anivaary he
 a number of amendments to this Finance Bill were introduced at the last minute which are related to political donations and their transparency, the tribunal for settlement of disputes of all departments and their appointment process
 isi ke tahat nagdi len dein ko teen lakh se ghataakar do lakh kar diya gaya he
 All these should be discussed separately but we would like to keep today's topic related to Aadhaar
 ek july 2017 se iskar ritern bharne or pan number ke liye aadhaar number dena anivaary ho jayega
 Income tax returns will no longer be filed without Aadhaar
 jis kisi ke paas pan card he use ek july tak aadhaar number dena hoga
 If you do not do this then the PAN card will become invalid
 mana jayega ki aapke paas pan card yaa pan number nahin he
 Many questions have been raised again with Aadhaar being made mandatory in income tax form and PAN number
 2009 se lekar 2017 ke bich aadhaar ke istamaal ko lekar, iske li hone se lekar anivaary kiye jane ke khatare ko lekar kai bahasein suni, pachaason lekh padhe
 On the other hand we have seen in society that there is a lot of enthusiasm about the base
 zyaadaatar raajnneetik dal ke kaaryakarta aadhaar card ko matadaata pahchaan patr kii tarah banavaane main jute rahete hai
 It is often said that this threatens your privacy
 yaad kiijie, jab aap aadhaar card banane gaye tab kya kisi ne aapako bataaya tha ki ise kaise sambhaal kar rakhana he, kise dena he kise nahin dena he, agar yah li ho gaya to kya hoga
 Did you ask main galat ho saktaa hum magar phir bhi aapse kuch sawaal hai
 Do you understand the meaning of privacy? Do you think its privacy should be maintained? Do you think that the government knows everything about you? Do you think that your Aadhaar number is also with private companies? Do you know what will happen if the Aadhaar number is leaked? loktantr ko khatara to tab bhi he jab aadhaar nahin he, aadhaar hone ke baad isaki soochna kisi raajnneetik dal, company ke paas jane ke baad aapako kis tarah kaa khatara ho saktaa he kya aap is sawaal ko mahatv dete hai? mujhe lagata he aadhaar ko lekar aapmen se zyaadaatar bilkul pareshaan nahin hai
 That's why 112 crore Indians made Aadhaar cards with full enthusiasm
 aisa nahin ki isaki aalochana yaa khatre ko lekar akhabaaron main lekh nahin chape
 There is hardly any discussion on TV but rightly
 aadhaar ko anivaary banaaye jane ke aalochakon kii ek baat ke liye tarif karnaa chahta hum
 They were criticizing even when the arrival of Aadhaar was coming and are still doing it when more than one hundred crore Indians have taken Aadhaar numbers
 duusari taraf sarkaar hameshaa aadhaar ko lekar aashwast nazar aati he
 If critics have a point, then why do not all political parties speak against it
 sansad main hi kyon bolte hai
 Why don't you come out of Parliament and speak among you
 ek sawaal khud se or aam logon se he
 Do any documents give us psychological protection in the name of identity and for this security we are ready to lose the security which we do not realize, someone else has

 Between 2009 and 2017, i heard many debates about the use of Aadhaar, the risk of it being leaked and mandated, read fifty articles
 duusari taraf hamane samaaj main dekha ki aadhaar ko lekar gazab kaa utsaah he
 Most political party workers are busy making Aadhaar card like voter ID card
 aksar kaha jaataa he ki isse hamaari aapaki privesi ko khatara he
 Remember, when you went to make an Aadhaar card, did anyone tell you how to handle it, whom to give, whom not to give, what would happen if it was leaked
 kya aapane poocha tha
 i may be wrong but you still have some questions
 kya aap privesi yani niztaa kaa matlab samajhate hai? kya aap samajhate hai ki isaki gopneeyata bani rahani chahie? kya aap samajhate hai ki aapaki har baat sarkaar jane? kya aap samajhate hai ki aapkaa aadhaar number privet companiyon ke paas bhi ho? kya aap jaanate hai ki aadhaar number li ho gaya to kya hoga?tippaniyan The danger to democracy is there even when there is no Aadhaar, after being Aadhaar, what kind of danger can you face after going to a political party, company, do you value this question? i think most of you are not bothered about Aadhaar at all

 That cowardly attack shook India
 ab ye gunj uthi ki kab tak hindustan apane javaanon kaa balidaan yun hi dekhtaa rahegaa

 On the Pulwama attack, former army chief General Bikram Singh said that Pakistan is behind this attack
 sabase pehle jammu-kashmir ke jin ilaakon main hamaari sena tainaat he, us ilaake kaa rivyuu karnaa chahie
 Planning will have to be done keeping in mind the strategy that terrorists are adopting
 iske alaava pakistan ko munhtod jawaab dene kaa bahut plan sena ke paas he

 General Bikram Singh said that now the government has to decide how it will take action

 We were happy when the surgical strike took place
 hamen ummid thi ki kam se kam 5-6 strike hogi, lekin pehali sargical strike ke baad lanbaa phul stop laga diya gaya or jashn maananaa shuru kar diya gaya
 We will have to take major action against Pakistan once again, so that it hurts
 is bich agar ham badi karrwai karte hai to aarthik tangi se jujh rahaa pakistan tut jayega
 After this incident, Home Minister Rajnath Singh was very angry
 unke saath chalane vaale sutron ne bataaya ki itnaa kabhi grahamantri gusse main nahin dikhe
 Talking to the media after the attack, Rajnath Singh said that we understand our responsibilities well and assure the people of the country that whatever action is necessary to take this incident, we will leave no stone unturned to do it

 atirikt solicytor general tushaar mehta ne 11 july ko dhara 377 maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi supreme court kii paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ko bataaya ki centre is maamle main adaalat ke vichaaron ko hi tavajjo degaa
 This cannot be the attitude of a government which is in favor of non-criminalization
 samarthan to tab kehalaata, jab sarkaar algebiticu samudaay par hone vaale utpeeda ko mitaane or unhen barabari kaa haq dilaane ke liye halafanama pesh karti
 This is what the UPA government did in 2012
 tab ke atorni general divangat gulam vaahnavati ne adaalat main kaha tha ki sarkaar ne dilli hycourt ke naaz foundation vaale faisle se kaaphi kuch janaa-samajha he or vah dhara 377 ko hataa dene ke paksh main he
 Vahanvati did not stop here, he also said that this law is a symbol of sexual imperialism under colonial rule and Section 377 is not in accordance with India's tolerant tradition and values
 baad main jab sarvocch adaalat ne centre banaam suresh kumaar kaushal maamle main faisla sunaaya to centre sarkaar ne samiksha yachika daayar kii
 But when the decision on the review petition was reversed, he did not take steps to abolish this law
 iske baavjood tab kii sarkaar ne kam se kam ek saaf or suvichaarit rukh jaahir kiya tha
 On the contrary, the present Additional Solicitor General did not stop only that the Government has no stand in this matter
 unhone ekaadhik baar adaalat main kaha ki unhen kuch ashankaayen hai
 But it turned out that these apprehensions were not the ones that caused s
 ke
 Mistakes of skill could be repeated
 iske badale sarkaar yah chaahati thi ki adaalat agar raahat dena chaahati he to uske saath yah satarkta kaa note bhi jode ki isse vyabhichaar or pashaviktaa badaae kaa khatra he
 The matter of bestiality in this case is particularly absurd, no petitioner has argued this on any occasion and this non-essential 'concern' of the Additional Solicitor General can only distract the court from the plea of the petitioners
 yahi nahin, atirikt solicetre general yachikakartaon kii jirah ke vakt lagaataar tokataki yaa shikaayat karte rahe ki ye adaalat se jaisi raahat maang rahe hai, vah yachika ke daayre main nahin aati
 Even Tushar Mehta questioned the relevance of the constitutional arguments of the petitioners
 unhone algebiticu samudaay ke sanghathan banane ke adhikaar se sambandhit daleelon par khaskar ashankaayen jaahir kin or aapatti darj kii
 So, many times he had to hear rebuke from the court
 baharhaal, adaalatein to faisla hi suna sakati hai par us par amal ke liye rajya kii sakriy bhoomika kii darkaar hoti he
 In this case, it will certainly be a step forward if the court decides not to apply Section 377 to consenting consenting adults (and thereby rid LGBTQ people of criminal clauses)
 lekin iske baad duusari bhoomika rajya yaa sarkaar kii hogi ki vah faisle par puri gambhirtha se amal kare or samudaay ke logon kii dhar-pakad band kare
 Then, the state will also have to amend section 377
 isliye sarkaar ke maujuuda rukh se kai tarah ke andeh ubharate hai
 Although she does not want to say anything openly, her attitude does not seem to be in favor of the LGBTQ community
 isliye is maamle main philhal to yahi lagata he ki sarvocch adaalat agar samudaay ke haq main faisla suna bhi de to vah sarkaar kii berukhi main ulajhakar rah jayega
 More than this rude thing, the government is not just silent in the Supreme Court, it is also giving strong arguments and every word of its pleas is like contempt of this community
