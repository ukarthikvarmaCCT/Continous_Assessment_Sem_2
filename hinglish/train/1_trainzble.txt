 Congress says Rafael deal is harmful for India
 purv raksha mantri eke antni ne congress daftar press vaarta kar rafel sauda ko nuksaan kaa sauda qaraar diya
 If Antony believes, this deal will cost India dearly
 unhone kaha ki 'jab upie kii sarkaar ne is desh kii jimmedaari 2014 main chodi, us samay ye chijen sunishchit thi ki bhartiya airforce kioparational requaryamentke liye 126 aircraft kii jarurat he or shuukravaar jo sauda tay kiya gaya he wo sawaalon ke ghere main he'
 According to Antony, 36 aircraft were fixed at that time, but given the situation now, this deal is not enough, he said that this is a basic question related to national security? To prove his argument, he said that Indian The Air Force has 42 approved squadrons, as of today, 32 squadrons are operational and by 2022 they will be reduced to just 25
 is paristhiti main jab china or pakistan apni samrik shakti badha rahaa he to kya ye 36 jahaaj is saare paripekshya ko dekhte hue bhartiya airforce kii jo jarurat he usko puraa kar paaenge

 According to what has been revealed now, 36 ships of 36 will be purchased from France, the opposition raised the question that the Prime Minister used to talk about 'make in India', whether 'make in India' in this deal is not completely banished Has it been played? xxrep 11 - afghanistan kii rajdhani kabul kii ek shiya masjid main shuukravaar ko hue aatmghaatee visafot main kam se kam 30 logon kii maut ho gai or 45 anya ghayal ho gaye

 Modi is the first Prime Minister of India to visit the LTTE stronghold Jaffna city
 apane antim padaav ke tahat srilanka pahunche modi ne colombo kii yatra kii
 He also visited the ancient capital of Sri Lanka, Anuradhapura, Talaimannar and Jaffna

 He was accompanied by Tourism Minister Arjuna Ranatunga

 On Saturday, Modi inaugurated the railway station prepared with the help of India in Talaimannar
 srilanka daure ke aakhri din piem ne jafana kaa daura kiya
 There he handed over 20,000 houses built with the help of India to the people devastated in the war
 is dauraan modi ne aitihaasik nagar anuradhapura kaa bhi daura kiya or shrimahabodhi vriksh kii puja archana kii
 In this visit to three countries, the Prime Minister signed several bilateral agreements

 The Sangh stamped the name of Bhaiyyaji Joshi for the third time and Modi's favorite Dattatreya Hosbole sir missed out on becoming a caretaker
 nagpur kaa sandesh saaf he
 Bhaiyaji may not be supporting Joshi's health, but the Sangh stands with him
 aresas ke taaja chintan kaa nichod yahi he ki bhaiyaji joshi hi teesri baar aresas ke sarkarywah honge
 Significantly, the head caretaker in RSS has the number two
 sangh pramukh ke baad sanghathan main sar kaayrvah kii hi chalati he
 The role of the head caretaker is also important in coordinating with all organizations, promoting and deciding important policies
 bhaiyaji joshi ko 2012 main duusari baar sar kaarywah chunaa gaya tha
 But this time, Bhaiyaji Joshi sought freedom from responsibility by citing poor health
 haalanki, sangh kaa ek dhada dattatreya hosbhole ko unki jagah laana chahta tha lekin aisa nahin hua
 How Kata Dattatreya's Pattadattatreya Hosabale is said to have good relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 lekin bataaya jaataa he ki sangh aise kisi shaks ke kandhe par sar kaarywah kii jimmedaari daalane se kataraa gaya, jo rishte kii vajah se modi sarkaar se do took baat karne main hichak jaae

 lekin, jamini str par abhi jang jari he
 For the past several years, all the local leaders who have been preparing for the elections are not ready to accept the terms of this alliance
 jis vajah se lakhanu madhya vidhansabha seat ke saath-saath kuch siton par gathbandhan kaa pench fansaa hua he
 The dispute over some seats is such that the top leadership of both parties have negotiated to settle it
 akhilesh or rahul kii puri koshish he ki voton kaa bikharaav na ho
 After the alliance, both parties have the exercise to somehow bring their local leaders and activists together

 This is Akhilesh's mind, Akhilesh Yadav wants that in the seats where SP candidates are strong, Congress candidates should leave the field and campaign for SP
 lekin, congress netaa khud ko ladaai main maan kar chal rahe hai

 There are two sensations - the first feeling is the face, the stains are very dark, the hats, the tilism, i do not sing with fear from the truth, i do not sing such a sight, i am not able to meet in the fair of my own city
 i do not sing the song again and again - the second feeling is the new song, i am born with broken wires, the bassist has risen in the chest of the voice Seeing the line of Arunim in the new sprout, all yellow, cuckoo's kuhuk night, i know who will listen to the broken dreams, i will not listen to the sorrow of the broken dreams, i will not accept the rage on the eyelids; doodh main daraar pad gaikhun kyon safed ho gaya?bhed main abhed kho gaya
 The martyrs were divided, the songs were cut, there was a dagger in the heart
 doodh main daraar pad gai
 The smell of landmines in the fields, broken Nanak's verses have risen, is a disturbed bit
 vasant se bahaar jhad gaidoodh main daraar pad gai
 Hatred with your own shadow, hugs are beginning to be out of the way, the path of self-destruction, you are concerned about the country
 baat banaaen, bighad gai
 The milk turned sour

 plastic kii bottle ko jamaa karne vaale ko prati bottle ke liye paanch rupee die jaaenge
 This step will also help in preserving the environment
 purv madhya railway ke chaar steshnon patna jankshan, rajendranagar, patna sahib or danapur stesan par reverse vending mashin lagaai he, jisamen pani kii plastic kii botalon ko krash kar isse tii-shart or topi banaai ja rahi he
 Rajesh Kumar, Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO) of East Central Railway told IANS, "east Central Railway is now making T-shirts with plastic bottles of empty water lying idle at railway stations
 railway steshnon par lage bottle krashar mashin ke plastic kaa istemaal tii-shart banane ke liye hoga
 "he said," These T-shirts will be suitable to wear in all seasons
 tii-shart banane ke liye railway kaa mumbai kii ek company se qaraar hua he
 Soon T-shirts made of these plastic bottles will be available to the people in the market
 "unhon kaha ki abhi haal hi main jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi main aisi hi tii-sharto kii pradarshnee lagaai gai thi, jise logon ne khub pasand kiya
 He informed that this will free the railways from the plastic waste and pollution left at the stations and tracks
 unhone kaha, "ek anumaan ke mutabik bharat vishwa main upbhog hone vaale plastic kaa do se teen pratshat upbhog karata he
 Average plastic consumption per person per day is seven kilograms to eight kilograms
 akele railway main pani kii bottle ke kul kachare kaa paanch pratishat isamen yogadan hota he
 "he said that after using plastic bottles of water it has to be crushed, but due to ignorance people do not do it and throw it anywhere, it causes pollution at railway stations and railway tracks
 unhone kaha, "ab yatriyon ko khaali bottle ke liye paanch rupee milenge
 They will get this five rupees in the form of vouchers from the bio-crush agency of the railway
 is paise kaa istemaal kai chuninda dukaanon or mal main saamaan kharidne ke liye kiya ja sakegaa
 "CPRO Kumar said that the passenger has to put his empty bottles in the bottle crusher machine installed at Patna Junction, Rajendranagar, Patna Sahib and Danapur stations
 krashar mashin main bottle daalane ke samay mobile number daalana padataa he
 After pouring the bottle and then crushing, you get a voucher related to the amount along with the thank you message

 bharat main narendra modi ke yug main israel ke saath rishton kii nai gaatha likhi ja rahi he
 However, it is also true that India's relationship with Israel has always improved under the Congress rule rather than during the Congress era
 donon deshon ke sambandhon ko lekar hameshaa se kaha jaataa rahaa he ki inke bich gopneey prem sambandh hai
 But after Modi came to power, this love affair has come to the fore
 kuch hi maheenon ke antaraal main donon deshon ke sheersh netaa ek-duusare desh kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Defense deals between the two countries are steadily increasing
 netanyahu kha rahe the khaanaa, baja naragis kaa ye mashhoor ganaaisa nahin he ki congressraj menisraelke saath dosti nahin thi, lekin us daur main sambandh gopneey hi rahaa he
 To begin with the Jawaharlal Nehru era, Nehru's foreign policy gave prominence to the unity of the world and the principle of non-violence
 or is aadhaar par bharat falstin kaa khulkar samarthan karata rahaa
 However, India was recognized as a state in 1950 after Israel was declared independent in 1948
 sheet yuddh ke shuruaati daur main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne 1955 ke bandung sammelan main israel ko nimantrit karne par vichaar kiya lekin baad main unhone iraadaa badal liya tha
 But after the end of the Cold War in the 90s, the circumstances of the world and the needs of India changed
 phir bharat ne israel se sainya sambandh badhanaa shuru kar diya
 Netanyahu said to Modi, the revolutionary leader, Modi said - the most important friend, after independence, the Congress ruled most of the time in India, and during this period relations with Arab countries were very good
 unhen naaraaz nahin karne ke kaaran bharat kabhi bhi israel ke saath khulkar aage nahin aa sakaa
 One of the important reasons behind not making Arab countries angry was the work of Indians in large numbers

 After being declared as an independent nation in 1948, India recognized Israel in 1950 after 2 years
 israel ke saath rishton kii shuruyaat 1960 ke dashak se hi ho gai thi
 He gave military help to India in the 1962, 1965 and 1971 wars
 khufia agency ro ke gathan par sahyog bhi diya
 After the war with Pakistan in 1971, Israel was the first country in the world to recognize Bangladesh as an independent nation
 agast 1977 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri morarji desai ke kaal main israeli videsh mantri ne bharat kaa gopneey daura kiya
 This was the first major political tour of India from his side

 Former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi followed the path of her father Pandit Nehru and remained close to Palestine in place of Israel in foreign policy
 1985 main tatkaaleen bhartiya piem rajeev gandhi ne sanyukt raashtra kii vaarshik aam sabha main israeli pradhanmantri se mulaakaat kii
 This was the first meeting of the Indian counterpart of any Indian Prime Minister

 kya kahen? hwat tu se? kino kaav? assam ke buno ke ek naatak kaa naam he yah
 As much as it was astonishing to see its dwarf actors performing a full one-and-a-half hour performance, it is surprising to see the rapidly changing face of today's theater
 ''kya kahen?'' 8-22 janvari tak mandi house ke aasapaas dasek sabhagaaron main chale rashtriya natya vidhyalay ke salanaa jalse bharat rang mahotsav (bhaarangam) main is tevar vaale kai naatakon ko dekhakar munh se yahi baat nikalati he
 Use of multimedia and freedom of communication were the exception until a few years ago
 ab ve hi mukhya dhara ban jane kii prakriya main hai
 Traditional anecdote with simplicity is now about to become a bygone / stale matter
 ye nae prayog, visheshkar yuvaaon main, khaasi jigyaasa or halchal paidaa kar rahe hai
 The biggest change in the new era has been in the language
 bhaarangam ke sabase charchit naatakon main se ek da water stesan main koi samvaad hi nahin tha
 In this presentation by Shankar Venkateswaran of Thrissur (kerala), between two hours, 18 passersby reach and depart the tap with a spout
 itane hi main har rahgeer udaasi, karunaa, saundarya or prem jaise kai bhav jagaa jaataa he
 There is only one sound on the stage: water dripping from the tap
 dhairya kaa khaasaa imtahaan lete hue yah naatak dhire-dhire darshak ko apni or aasapaas ke parivesh kii samiksha par le aata he
 (each and every audience's whispers are heard
 400 ke kareeb darshak do ghante main 500 se zyada baar khaanse / chhinke)
 Interestingly, even though there is no dialogue, these plays are fully understood by their visuals / visual language
 suman mallipeddy ne papa laden main abhinaytaon ke abhyaas kii bhashaa jibarish ko hi naatak kii bhashaa bana diya
 But the deep sarcasm running on middle-class life was clearly visible
 puranic paatr ravan ke bare main kuch moti dharanaon ko lekar ghante bhar kii ekal prastuti dene vaaleen mayakrishna raav kathakali nrity kii kuch mudraaen akhriyaar karte hue, gahari mardaana aawaaj main bas kuch fusfusaati-si hai
 The drama Mei Sounds of the Attakalari Rangamandal in Bangalore was also dialogue-less and, to be honest, a dance performance
 jhule kii doriyon-si nrutyaangnaon kii loch or aatmavishvaas se bhari maadakta
 Everything is a modern celebration of the body
 naatakon kii duniya main aisi nrity pradhan prastutiyaan hameshaa bahes / vivaad kaa sabab rahi hai
 "why in the courtyard of the Khalis dance drama?" Actually, it is time for boundaries to break
 sahitya main kahani, aatmakatha, sansmaran, tippanee or upanyaas in sabake bich ab kai baar antar mitata dikh rahaa he
 In such a situation, there is a belief that a drama-like genre that covers all the arts has to increase its thinking
 andhra pradesh ke kuranul jile ke chote-se gaanv sarparajpuram se nikalakar aae, papa laden ke nirdeshak suman kehete hai, ''pehle naatakon main heroism zyada tha
 It was largely a fixed form
 ab nae rangakarmi or aaj ke darshak bhi teji se badalati duniya ko dekh rahe hai
 To increase the interest of the audience in the plays one has to find a new form
 ''manch kaa badshaah to abhinayta hi rahaa he
 But in search of this new form, the possibility of this actor becoming a juju is being born
 kai prastutiyon main vah dikhaa bhi
 But some good tricks are also seen here
 bhaarangam ke bisek hindi naatakon main ek samjhauta ko len
 Based on the story of Muktibodh by Begusarai (bihar) painter Praveen Gunjan, the actor Manvendra Singh's amazing energy paired with new tricks in the stage, stage, hops, even acting
 10 ghante ke naatak ko dekhne laayak bana diya
 Italy's Pino Di Budeo's performance in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was an example of the multimedia use of staged stories
 manch par aage-peeche do jhine parade
 On one side, on the other, the video of his creatures stirring, the actor in the middle taking his full space for payment in a comic style
 sabakaa samaayojan vaaki adbhut tha
 Ramin Gray of England, The Golden Dragon and Poland's Monica Zreppka's In the Name of Jacob S
 bhi is lihaaj se ullekhneey prastutiyaan thim
 In one scene of Papa Laden, an actor Tishupepper rolls in a finger and falls like Draupadi's rag

 Indicating a change in its strategy to deal with Gandhian Anna Hazare's protests over the Lokpal Bill, the government avoided personal attacks on him but justified his arrest, saying that disobeying the police order was not acceptable in a democracy
 grih mantri pi
 Chidambaram told reporters, "it was not a pleasant act and none of us are happy to explain the circumstances in which this development took place
" yah dukhadaayi kartavya he or ham ise utani hi gambhirtha se kar rahe hai jitani gambhirtha iske liye jaruri he
 With this, he strongly supported the arrest of Hazare, saying that he stepped in when the Delhi Police came to the conclusion that he and his supporters would commit a cognizable offense in violation of the prohibition order
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal or soochna evam prasaaran mantri ambika soni ke saath samvaadadaata sammelan main chidamrabam ne kaha, ‘kal hajaare ke saath mulaakaat kaa prayaas kiya gaya tha lekin vah sambhav nahin ho paaya
 This morning the police officer met Hazare and drew his attention to his statement that he and his supporters would violate the injunction
 police adhikari ne unase unka iraadaa poocha
 "chidambaram told," Hazare said that he was going to Jayaprakash Narayan Park for violating prohibitory orders
 tab police is nishkarsh par pahunchi ki vah or unke samarthak sangyeya aparaadh kar sakate hai or shanti bhang hone kii ashanka he, aise main police ne aparaadh dand prakriya samhita kii dhara 107 or 151 ke tahat karrwai karne kaa faisla kiya
 The Union Ministers, however, disagreed with Hazare's way of bringing Lokpal Bill but made it clear that he disagreed with his concern over corruption
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘ham anna ke saath hai or anna hamaare saath hai (jahaan tak bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sangharsh kii baat he)
 'he said that disagreement is arising out of Anna's opposition to his bill and absolutely' denying 'the second bill
 chidambaram ne yah mana ki bhrashtachar ko lekar janata main gahari chintaa or naaraazgi he lekin unhone usee ke saath yah bhi kaha ki lokapal koi rambaan nahin he balki vah usase nibatane ke kai upayon main ek he
 The change in the government's strategy probably came after Rahul Gandhi's meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday
 is bhent ke baad samprag ke sankatmochak pranav mukherjee or chidamrabam ne aaj sansad main aapas main charchaa kii
 Moving away from the party's earlier stance of bitterly condemning Anna, Soni said that she is an eminent person and that the government had trusted her to be peaceful
 haalanki unka yah bhi kaha tha ki koi bhi is baat kii guarantee nahin de saktaa ki jab ek sthaan par itani badi sankhya main log ekatra honge tab koi samasya nahin paidaa hogi kyonki manch par asin vyaktiyon kaa us andolan main shaamil ho rahe har vyakti par niyantran nahin hota
 He said that Anna may have been given wrong advice by his colleagues, former IPS officer Kiran Bedi and senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who is well-versed in the law
 soochna evam prasaaran mantri ne media kii in khabaron kaa bhi hawala diya ki jab rajghat par police ne kiran bedi ko roka tha tab unke saath bhaajapa ke do netaa the
 Responding to the barrage of questions, Sibal said, 'it is a constitutional right to protest and no government can be against it

 The Supreme Court has given two weeks time for a reply to one of the lawyers who made allegedly insulting comments on women in a BBC documentary on the December 16 Delhi gang rape case
 sheersh court donon vakeelon ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye mahila vakil sanghathan kii yachika par sunwaayee kar rahi thi
 a Bench of Justice v Gopal Gowda and Justice c Nagappan directed Manohar Lal Sharma, a lawyer for a convict, to file the reply within two weeks
 sharma ne daawa kiya ki vah nirdosh hai or unhone maukhik rup se paksh rakhane kii anumati maangi
 Sharma told the court, citing Sanskrit ‘shlok’ that he respects women and considers them just like his mother
 unhone kaha ki vah supreme court mahila vakil association ke pratinidhiyon ke saath baatcheet karke ise sulajhane ke liye taiyaar hai
 He also refused to make controversial statements to documentaries
 is par court ne kaha, ‘aap apana jawaab daakhil kijiye
 When Sharma was not present during the hearing of the petition, the lawyers of the lawyers' association and others said that he and another lawyer AP Singh were trying to escape the notice of the court
 manohar laal sharma baad main court main pesh huye or unhone notice sweekaar kiya
 After this, the court told the women's organization that the second lawyer would be served notice within two weeks
 isse pehle, court ne donon vakeelon ko notice jari karte huye kaha tha ki is maamle main vichaar kii aavashyaktaa he
 The women's lawyers' association, on its plea, requested the ban on entry of these two advocates into the Supreme Court premises, saying that their alleged remarks in the controversial BBC documentary documentary were 'inhuman, inappropriate, malicious and against the dignity of women'
 ’ supreme court baar association ne mahila vakeelon ke sanghathan kii yachika kaa samarthan kiya he
 In its petition, this organization has sought to protect the fundamental rights of women advocates in the apex court so that they can work with dignity without any partiality and repugnance

 The problem of governments is that they are considering compensation and relief work as a solution to the drought
 jis sankat ko insaanon ne milakar kai saal se bulaayaa he wo ek din yaa ek saal main nahin jayega
 The amount that is released in the name of relief work is heard in hundreds of crores while walking from Delhi and when reaching the hands of the farmer, it becomes hundred or two hundred rupees
 kisaan jitna sarkaar se laachaar he utana samaaj se bhi or in donon se zyada apane aap se bhi
 The biggest problem for him is that no one is listening to him

 Vinay did not walk 1200 kilometers to speak against any government, but came to say that if the matter arises in the Delhi media, then perhaps the Prime Minister will listen

 This picture shows that the water apocalypse has occurred, the apocalypse of collecting water has not been done

 On Sunday, when the Pani Express reached Miraj in Pune from Rajasthan's Kota Workshop, local leaders welcomed them with flower garlands

 The Ministry of Railways and the Government of Maharashtra have worked hard together for this train

 For this, the government is also laying a new pipeline

 In the last 10 years, China has saved Jaish kingpin Masood Azhar four times from becoming an international terrorist
 jab jab lagata tha ki yuan masood ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kar degaa tab tab ain vakt par china apane vito kaa istemaal kar letaa tha
 So the question is, why was China doing this? to iskaa jawaab he paisa or power
 Actually, China has invested trillions of rupees in Pakistan
 isliye pakistan ko naaraaz nahin kar saktaa
 And peace in India is not in China's interest
 lihaaza wo pakistan ke zarie bharat ko bas uljhaae rakhana chahta he
 When the whole world stands against Pakistan on the issue of terror, China saves it by supporting Pakistan because of its huge investment

 Moreover, China is settling its entire city near Gwadar Port
 yani kul milakar china ne pakistan main arabon dollar kaa nivesh kar rakhaa he
 In such a situation, he may find it difficult to leave Pakistan
 bharat ko gherne kii koshishpure dakshin purvi asia main china ko takkar dene kii kuwvat agar kisi ke paas he to wo bharat he
 China also considers it its biggest economic rival
 isliye china chahta he ki bharat or pakistan ko aapas main uljhaakar rakhaa jaae
 In this sense, if he had gone against Masood, India would have not only looked stronger in the international fraternity but also on the Pakistan front
 chini julmon sitam par khamosh pakkuxa ko musalamaanon kaa himachati bataakar kashmir main yuvaaon ko bargalane vaala pakistan
 The Uygar in China takes a blind eye to Muslims
 aapako bataa den ki china ke uigar musalamaanon par kai tarah ke pratibandh hai
 But Pakistan never raised its voice against China on this issue
 or to or islamic sahyog sanghathan ke deshon main se sirf paak hi in pratibandhon ko sahi maanata he
 Therefore China needs Pak on this front too
 bharat ke badhate kad se china pareshanismen koi shaq nahin he ki pichley ek dashak se bharat ne aarthik or kootnithik str par jo tarakkee kii he
 China considers it a threat to itself
 saath hi bharat-america ke achche sambandh bhi china ke khilaaf jate hai
 So China has made Masood Azhar a weapon
 jaisaa bharat ajahar masood ko samajhataa he
 In the same way, China believes the Dalai Lama
 or bharat ne dalai lamas ko sharan de rakhi he
 China knows that Maulana Masood Azhar and other terrorists who grow in Pakistan are a threat to humanity
 magar wo bharat ko apane baraabar khadaa hone se rokna bhi chahta he
 Therefore, Gahe Bahega becomes a support for a terrorist like Masood Azhar sitting in Pakistan
 jo aaj nahin to kal use bhi dasenge
 And by then it will probably be too late

 Team India's dream of winning the World Cup for the third time was shattered after the defeat in the 2019 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand
 bharat ke world cap se baahar hone ke baad yah mana ja rahaa tha ki diggaj wicketiper ballebaaj mahendra singh dhoni international cricket se sanyas le lenge
 Dhoni has not announced retirement yet
 yah baat saamne aa rahi he ki captain viraat kohli ne dhoni se tii-20 world cap 2020 tak rukne kaa anurodh kiya he
 According to a report in DNA, a source close to Kohli said that Virat Kohli stopped Dhoni from retiring immediately, after which he changed his mind
 viraat ko lagata he ki dhoni feet hai or wo agle saal tii-20 world cap tak khel sakate hai
 Rishabh Pant has been selected in the team keeping in mind the T20 World Cup
 haalanki team management yah bhi nahin chahta he ki dhoni is dauraan sanyas le len
 The team management believes that if Dhoni retires and Pant gets injured then there will be an emptiness in terms of World Cup, which will be difficult to fill
 bhartiya team management ko team main koi anya wicketiper nahin chahie
 Virat Kohli, who spoke on the defeat of the World Cup, told- The atmosphere of the dressing room was four wicketkeepers in Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rishabh Pant, Dinesh Karthik and KL Rahul in Team India in 2019 World Cup
 lekin ab chayankartaaon ne saaf kar diya he ki wo bhavishya ko dekhte hue pant ko ek wicketiper kii bhoomika main dekh rahe hai
 Perhaps this is why Rishabh Pant is the lone wicket-keeper on the West Indies tour
 aise main dhoni team ke saath to rahenge, lekin ek menter kii bhoomika main
 a few days ago a Team India official said, "if Pant is injured then who is his option?" sach kahuun to duusari taraf hamaare paas jitne bhi naam hai, unamem se koi bhi dhoni kaa muqabla karne ke laayak nahin he
 Yes, there is no denying that Pant is the future of the team and that he should be tried in all formats, but Dhoni's guidance and presence is also very important

 On the other hand, when Water Minister Rajendra Gautam was asked in the Delhi Assembly, he said that there is democracy in the party and everybody can express their opinion, when they were asked why internal democracy is being shown publicly on Twitter like this So he smiled

 However, the year 2012 brought a wave of Parrikar's popularity in the state and he won his party 21 out of 40 seats in the assembly

 The bjp's winning momentum continued in 2014, when the party won both Lok Sabha seats in the general election
 centre main modi ke netritv main mantrimandal ke shapath grahan karne ke baad parrikar ko november 2014 main raksha mantri kaa pad diya gaya

 Before the gandhi-mandela series, DDCA officials continued to make rounds of the court
 aakhirkaar adaalat ne unke paksh main faisla bhi sunaaya, lekin iske saath kai suzav or nirdesh bhi jari kar die
 Now the big question is whether the DDCA uses it only to remove the difficulty in the front or to clean its image by fixing its issues
 guuruuvaar subah dilli hycourt ke baahar didisie yani dilli cricket sangh ke adhikariyon ke chehron par badi raahat dikhi
 Before the two-week Test match in Delhi, the High Court has seen the decisions taken by the Cricket, Cricketers and Cricket Fans keeping the clouds hovering over the fourth Test match of the gandhi-mandela series
 purv test cricketer or didisie ke kaaryakari adhyaksh chetan chouhan ne court ke baahar jor dekar kaha, "jaisaa ki main pehle kah rahaa tha
 The match will take place and the match will be held in Delhi itself
 
 It has been fixed
 " After obtaining the Provisional Occupancy Certificate from MCD, DDCA also required NOC from Excise Department
 yah or baat he ki is enosi ke liye bhi didisie ko adaalat kaa daravaaza hi khatkhataana padaa
 Says Chetan Chauhan, "the honorable judge (from the Excise Department, Government of Delhi) said that in the amount you are saying, the principal amount is only 5 crore rupees, the rest is penalty and interest amount 
 " Significantly, the Delhi government is claiming that 24 of them as entertainment tax to DDCA
 45 karod rupye adaa karne hai
 Of this, Rs 5 crore is the principal amount, while Rs 6 crore is 13 in addition to the penalty, at a rate of 24% per annum
 45 karod rupye byaaj ke taur par dene hai, jabaki didisie daawa kar rahaa he ki usne exise vibhaag ko jarurat se zyada rakam de di he or use baaki paise waapas milane chahie
 The great thing is that if the DDCA does not organize the next Test match on time, then the claim of the T20 World Cup match next year would be very weak
 tippaniyan "the treasurer of DDCA says Ravindra Manchanda"
 
 
 bilkul aisa hi hota ki agar ham ye match nahin karvaa pate, to hamaare haath se tii-20 world cap kaa match bhi nikal jaataa
 The important thing is that if we are able to organize it, then we will also get a chance to organize a T20 match
 " DDCA officials have a big chance to find solutions to internal issues in the next one or two months
 sirf test match ke aayojan ko hi sabakuch maan lene ke chakkar main puri safai kaa ek bada mauka haath se nikal saktaa he
 Outside the Delhi High Court on Thursday morning, there was a big relief on the faces of the officials of DDCA, the Delhi Cricket Association
 dilli main do hafte baad hone vaale test match se pehle hycourt ne cricket, cricketrs or cricket phans ko dhyaan main rakhte hue jo faisle sunaae hai, unase gandhi-mandela siries ke chauthe test match par mandaraate badal puri tarah chant gaye dikhte hai
 Former Test cricketer and DDCA executive chairman Chetan Chauhan insisted outside the court, "as i was saying earlier
 match hoga or match dilli main hi hoga
 
 ye tay ho gaya he
 " emsidi se provisional ocupansy certificket lene ke baad didisie ko excise vibhaag se bhi enosi kii jarurat thi
 It is another matter that even for this NOC, DDCA had to knock the court door
 chetan chouhan kehete hai, "mananeey jaj ne (exise vibhaag, dilli sarkaar se) kaha ki aap jo rakam kah rahe hai usamen principal amanut to 5 karod rupaya hi he, baaqi to penlti or interest amount he
 " gauratlab he ki dilli sarkaar daawa kar rahi he ki didisie ko unhen intertenment tex ke taur par 24
 45 crores to be paid
 isamen se 5 karod rupye mul raashi he, jabaki 6 karod rupye penlti ke alaava 24 % salanaa byaaj kii dar se unhen 13
 45 crore rupees to be paid as interest, while DDCA is claiming that it has given excess amount to the excise department and it should get the rest of the money back
 badi baat yah he ki didisie agle test match kaa aayojan vakt par nahin karvaa paata, to agle saal tii-20 world cap ke match kii daavedaari bahut kamazor ho jaati
 The comments didisie ke koshadhyaksh Ravindra manachanda kehete hai, "
 
 
 It would have been exactly the same that if we could not get this match done, then the T20 World Cup match would have been left out of our hands
 ahm yah he ki ham iskaa aayojan karvaa paa rahe hai, to hamen tii-20 match ke aayojan kaa mauka bhi milegaa
 " didisie ke adhikariyon ke paas ek bada mauqaa he ki wo agle ek-do maheene main andruni masalon ke hal nikaal len
 a big chance of complete cleanliness can come out of the cycle of just assuming the test match
 purv test cricketer or didisie ke kaaryakari adhyaksh chetan chouhan ne court ke baahar jor dekar kaha, "jaisaa ki main pehle kah rahaa tha

 These days, the chief ministers of most non-bjp ruled states have the same cry that the Modi government does not listen to them
 kuch bhi maangane par taalamatol vaala ravaiya apanaati he
