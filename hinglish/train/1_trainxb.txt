 Kidneys Pain: a consumer court ordered a compensation of Rs 18 lakh for a three-year-old girl who had a kidney failure in 2004 due to hospital negligence
 rashtriya upabhokta vivaad nivaaran ayog (ensidiarsi) ne maharashtra ke acharya vinoba bhaave gramin aspataal ko nirdesh diya ki vah muaavje ke saath samiksha naamak bacchee ko uske upachaar par kharch kiye gaye dedh lakh rupee bhi adaa karegaa
 The girl had to have a kidney drain due to an infection caused by defects in surgery in the hospital

 uski surgery safal nahin rahi or 17 april ko oparation phir se kiya gaya
 The complaint alleges that the review later battled Bladder's problem and on May 10, he was rushed to another hospital where he underwent surgery
 ilaaj karne vaale doctor ne bacchee ke mata-pita ko bataaya ki uske blader main rui kaa ek tukdaa mila jo pehle aspataal main surgery ke baad chhot gaya tha
 Because of this, his condition worsened

 After this, the victim and her father turned to NCDRC and instructed them to increase the compensation to Rs 18 lakh

 org gat champion vishvanathan anand kareebi mukaable main haar taalane ke baad norway ke megnas carlson ke khilaaf vishwa shatranj championships kii chauthi baaji dra karaane main safal rahe
 In this match of twelve games, now when eight games are to be played, both the players are on par with 2-2 points
 is mukaable main pehali baar anand ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Earlier in the third game, they drew Carlson in trouble yesterday
 carlson ne aaj ek baar phir dikhaaya ki vah kisi bhi tarah kii chunauti se nipatane ko taiyaar hai
 Carlson changed his opening this time playing with black pieces, which was a good strategy
 unhone isse purv kaale moharon se pehali baar khelte hue kairo kaan opening kaa sahaara liya tha
 In the year 2000 at the Brain Games World Championship match in London, Vladimir Kramnik used the Berlin defense to defeat Russia's compatriot Gary Kasparov, after which this variation is widely used in elite chess
 anand ne bhi ab tak kaale moharon se acha pradarshan kiya he
 After the attack on students of African descent in Bangalore, one such news has now come from Hyderabad
 yahaan nigerian mul ke kuch yuvakon ne police main shikaayat darj karwaai he ki un par guuruuvaar kii raat sthaneey yuvakon ke dal ne hamalaa kiya
 The police have registered a case against unknown people in the case
 police ke mutabik, yuvakon kaa aarope he ki un par tolicowki ke hakimpat ilaake main sadak ke kinarehamla kiya gaya
 Banjara Hills Police has registered a case of assault and mistreatment against unknown people
 darj shikaayat main kaha gaya he ki hamalaavaron ke paas pistal or military chaaku bhi thi
 It is said that around 8:30 pm on Thursday night, when the Nigerian youths were returning from the mosque, some local youths passed comments on them and started quarreling
 police maamle main ipisi kii dhara 323 or 341 ke tahat cese darj kar jaanch kar rahi he
 Shatrughan Sinha, BJP MP from Bihari Babu and Patna Sahib, often silences everyone in reel and real life by calling them 'silent'
 lekin unka yah dialog loksabhaa main unheen par lagu ho gaya, kyonki haal hi samaapt hue sansad satr ke aankade bataate hai ki bijepi saansad puure satr sadan main khamosh hi rahe
 This figure is no less unfortunate for the country's politics
 kyonki saansadon ko janata isliye chunakar sansad main bhejti he ki ve unki aawaaj banenge
 Will raise the problems of the region in Parliament
 lekin afsos kishatrughna sinhapure satr ke dauraan khamosh rahe
 He neither participated in any debate in the House nor asked any question
 sinha patna sahib loksabhaa kshetra se saansad hai
 Like Shatrughan Sinha, another honorable RJD MP from Araria is Taslimuddin
 inhone bhi loksabhaa main puure satr ke dauraan kisi bahes main hissaa nahin liya
 Of the 40 mps of Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav Beehar who topped the debate, Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, suspended MP from RJD, took the most questions and participated in the debate
 loksabhaa kii report ke mutabik, madhepura se saansad pappu yadav ne haal ke sansad satr main 153 bahes main bhaag liya
 While second place BJP MP from Buxar Ashwani Kumar Choubey
 nalanda se jediu saansad kaushalendra kumaar 128 bahes main bhaag lekar tisare sthaan par rahe
 Rama Devi asked the maximum number of 323 questions, BJP MP Rama Devi from Shivhar topped the mps of Bihar
 rama devi ne is satr main 323 sawaal puche
 While BJP MP from Darbhanga Kirti Azad came second with 275 questions
 sansad satr main kisi bahes main bhaag nahin lene vaale arriya se argedy saansad tasalimuddin ne do sawaal, jabaki samastipur se algepi saansad ramchandra paswan ne teen sawaal puche
 Pappu Yadav also won here; MP Pappu Yadav also won in the matter of bringing non-official resolutions
 vah 15 gaiyr sarkari sankalp laakar bihari saansadon main top par rahe
 While Siwan SEBP MP Om Prakash Yadav was in second place and Janardhan Singh Sigriwal, BJP MP from Maharajganj in third place

 What happened in Kathua, Jammu is heart wrenching
 jammu-kashmir main ek aath saal kii ladki ke saath hui is darindagi ke khilaaf log sadakon par utar aae hai
 Thousands of voices filled with anger and pain are being raised from all over the country
 in awaajon ne aaropee do netaaon ko istipha dene ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The whole country is boiling in anger
 haa, ye jarur he ki nirbhaya kii tarah asifa kii khabar desh-duniya tak der se pahunchi
 Only a few months late, but that eight-year-old girl's painful scream made millions of people shudder together
 lagghi liye ghodon ko haankati us nanheen bacchee kii ruh ko kuch to sukun to mila hoga
 Coming into the ears of the lawyer who was fighting the fight, the girl must have said, do not leave them
 aap kalpana bhi nahin kar saktin kitna dard us vakt mujhe hota tha jab, bhukhe bhediyon kii tarah ye mujh par tut padate the
 It would have also said in the ears, what happened to me in your language was done with cruelty, it would be rape of a minor girl
 par main kya jaanu krurta ke saath kiya gaya balaatkaar kya hota he? ek nar ek maadaa par kyon tut padataa he, main kya jaanu? par haa itnaa jarur jaanati hum, jo kuch bhi in logon ne mere saath kiya meri ruh tak jakhmi ho gai
 That is why my soul is demanding justice today
 kathua cond ke doshiyon ko sajaa ke liye ladi ja rahi ladaai main 16 april ko jammu-kashmir ke do gaanv 'kunan or poshpora' ke log bhi shaamil ho gaye
 For the painful slaves of Kunan and Poshpora who have never heard before, these are just two villages, but those who have seen or heard the horror of the terror here 27 years ago, they cannot forget it
 peediton kaa aarope he ki us raat auraton ke saath samuhik balaatkaar hue or mardon ke saath jamkar marpet hui
 Demonstrations for Asifa are being held daily in Jammu
 lekin 16 april ko insaaf kii maang karne vaali kai awaajen in pradarshnon ke bich shaamil ho gayi
 One of these voices was that of a woman from Kunan village who had suffered the havoc that night in 1991 in Kunan village
 sufia (badla hua naam) kahati hai, agar 'kunan or poshpora' ke vakt nyaay mil gaya hota to aaj asifa ke saath ye darindagi karne kii kisi kii himmat nahin hoti
 'sufia says,' That night 150 women were raped together
 saare mardon ko band kar diya gaya tha do gharon main
 And then the army of soldiers was broken on women, girls and elderly women
 've aage kahati hai, ‘us raat jab faujee badahavaas se auraton par tut pade the
 The youngest girl among them was 14 years old and the eldest was 70 years old
 ’darasal kunan or poshpora ke peedita aaj bhi nyaay ke liye bhatak rahe hai
 Even after 27 years, he has not got justice
 lekin aaj ve log asifa ko nyaay dilaane ke liye sadakon par utre hai
 The hope is once again alive that maybe Asifa gets justice with her as well
 kunan gaanv ke hi pradarshan main shaamil yusuf (badla hua naam) kehete hai, ‘hamen acha laga ki aaj mahabuuba mufti sakhti ke saath bacchee asifa ke haq main khadi hai
 Two ministers have also resigned
 fast trek court main kathua kii peedita asifa kaa cese chal rahaa he
 This is all comforting
 ’ par saath hi ve ye bhi kehete hai ki jahaan ek taraf raahat mahasoos ho rahi he vahiin duusari taraf ham hairaan hai
 Why did the incident of mass rape like that took place 27 years ago, not shaken Chief Minister Sahiba? If this one rape can shake his soul, then why did the 150 rape incidents that night not penetrate his conscience? Is she not our Chief Minister? Yusuf says, 'if at that time the women, girls and elders of Kunan and Poshpora had got justice, Asifa would have been alive today

 After losing the Lok Sabha elections, he received several notices to vacate the government bungalow at 12 Tughlaq Road, but when he was not ready to leave the house, the administration cut off electricity and water

 In this regard, Chaudhary Ajit Singh says that NDMC people came to him on September 9 and asked to vacate the bungalow, but we said that Shraddh is going on now, so it is not right to vacate the house
 hamane ek flats kiraaye par liya he or ham ye bangala 25 sitambar tak khaali kar degen
 But then it is not known that he cut electricity and water in between
 ab yah to vahi bataa sakate hai
 Now Chaudhary Saheb cannot live without electricity, hence the farmers leader has hired a generator to keep the bungalow lighted and cool
 janarator oparator kaa kahana he ki iskaa roj kaa kiraaya 4000 rupee he or rojaanaa 200 litre dijal kharch hoga
 In this case, NDMC and CPWD say that the electricity-water connections of government houses of 30 former mps including Ajit Singh have been cut
 inamen 4 purv cabinet mantri hai
 Former ministers and mps whose connections to the bungalow have been cut off include names like Jitendra Singh, Brijendra Singla, PC Chacko, Avtar Singh Bhadana, BL Marandi and Arjun Roy

 jin do iees adhikariyon ke tabadale kiye gaye hai, unamem sanyukt mukhya nirvachan adhikari anita meshram ko vishesh sachiv alpsankhyak kalyaan kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he, jabaki azamgarh ke joint magistrate suryapal gangavar ko badaayun kaa mukhya vikaas adhikari banaaya gaya he
 Independence is an idea that is essentially tied to the development of human civilization
 aitihaasik rup se is vichaar ko taqatvar logon ne apane hisaab se paribhaashit kiya he taaki nihit swaarth vaale logon ko laabh pahunchaaya ja sake
 a person or a society has the right and power to speak, think and behave according to its own accord
 asahmati kii aazaadee ko aazaadee ke mul vichaar se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki vah uskaa abhinn ang he
 In a democratic society it is associated with freedom, equality and the right to express one's views
 rajya apni sharten thopate hue yah nahin kah saktaa ki har koi aaazaad he, par hamaare saath asahmat hone par pabandi he
 All the governments that have come to us have been protecting the interests of those who have money, which has led to huge inequality, and the majority of people who have no chance of political representation could not get a chance
 jaahir he, jin logon ke saath galat hua he, unke asantosh se rajyasatta ko dar lagata he
 When someone's land and forest are forcibly taken away, he is left homeless at the mercy of an urban aviary, then the expression of freedom can be the same form — disagreement
 vikaas ke hamaare kathith pratik—bade baandh, khadaanen or udyog—un adhikaron kii yaad dilaate hai jinhen vikaas ke naam chin liya gaya
 People's participation in the system, their right to disagree and the right to form an organization to oppose or criticize the government are inherently inherent elements that are necessary for any democratic structure to work and sustain
 asahmati kaa adhikaar or janatantric manchon par uskaa pradarshan din-ba-din ladkadaata ja rahaa he
 The politics of hate has paved the way for the politics of sanctions
 yahaan tak ki samvidhan main jo adhikaar hamen die gaye hai, unhen paane ke liye hamen adaalat main jaakar laduya pad rahaa he
 When people are converted into voiceless shadows, democracy and freedom will have no meaning
 (ursila ali se baatcheet par aadhaarit) In the process of searching for spokespersons for the Rajasthan assembly elections, the questions within the Congress have come to the fore with everyone
 pradesh congress mukhyalay main rashtriya pravaktaa priyanka chaturvedi ne ummidavaaron se jo sawaal puche unase pradesh congress ke siyasat main halchal paidaa ho gai
 Priyanka Chaturvedi asked many candidates who is the better leader among Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan

 Under this, Chaturvedi, the national spokesperson of the Congress and the convenor of the media cell in Jaipur, took the interview

 He said that in the last 4 years, BJP has done the work of misleading the people of the country
 desh kii janata se kiye ek bhi vaade ko puraa nahin kiya he
 Wherever BJP governments are in the country, including Rajasthan, mobilization is being promoted
 lekin janata ab bhaajapa kaa drama samaj chuki he or 2018 main rajasthan vidhansabha or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main iskaa jawaab degi
 On the question of BSP leader going abroad to Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Chaturvedi said that Rahul Gandhi is more Indian than Narendra Modi

 ) Like India, Sri Lanka is also considered a paradise for spinners, but looking at the practice matches before the Twenty20 World Championship, it seems that in this tournament, the fast bowlers can speak more than the spinners
 toornament main bhaag lene vaali vibhinn tiimon ke bich 13 se 17 sitambar tak khele gaye das abhyaas maichon par gaur karen to kuch maichon ko chhodkar adhiktar main tej yaa madhyam gati ke gendbaajon kaa dabadabaa rahaa
 In these matches, the fast bowlers took 75 wickets and the spinners took 35 wickets
 bharat sahit adhiktar tiimon ne apane spinneron ke bajaay tej gendbaajon par adhik bharosa dikhaaya
 India used three fast bowlers and two spinners in both their practice matches
 srilanka ke khilaaf match main tej gendbaaj irfan pathan ne paanch or lakshmipathi balaji ne teen wicket liye lekin pakistan ke khilaaf ye prabhavi nahin rahe jisamen of spinner ravichandran aswin ne chaar wicket hasil kiye
 The entire leg-spinner in Australia's spin department rests on Brad Hogg
 unhone abhi tak acha pradarshan karke team ko niraash nahin kiya lekin australia ne apane akraman main chaar tej gendbaaj rakhe hai
 It is the same situation for South Africa that has retained the only spinner as Robin Peterson
 dakshin africa kii newjiland par jeet main del sten ne ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 He took four wickets for 25 runs in this match
 unhen albi morkal or lonawabo sotsobe kaa acha sahyog mila
 The comments mejabaan srilanka ke spin vibhaag kii jimmedaari rangana herath par he lekin captain mahela jayavardhane ne abhyaas maichon main sanket die ki vah apane tej gendbaaj lasith malinga, nuwan kulshekhara, shaminda iranga or tisara perera par hi adhik bharosa dikhaaenge
 The West Indies certainly expect a charismatic performance from Sunil Narine but six of the eight wickets his bowlers took in practice matches went to the account of the fast bowlers
 fidel edwards, ravi rampal or captain derren saimi uski tej gendbaaji trimurti hai jinke har match main khilne kii sambhaavna he
 Pakistan have useful spinners in the form of Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez who can be successful here but Umar Gul is still the match-winning bowler of the team
 ireland or zimbabwe ke bich abhyaas match main irish spinner alex kusa ne teen over main chah ran dekar teen wicket liye or apni team kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaai lekin yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki is match main jo 13 wicket gire unamem das wicket tej or madhyam gati ke gendbaajon ne liye
 Consider the ten practice matches played between September 13 to 17 between the different teams participating in the tournament, except for a few matches where most of the fast or medium pace bowlers dominated
 in maichon main tej gendbaajon ne 75 to spinneron ne 35 wicket liye
 Most teams, including India, showed greater confidence in the fast bowlers rather than their spinners
 bharat ne apane donon abhyaas maichon main teen tej gendbaajon or do spinneron kaa upyog kiya
 In the match against Sri Lanka, fast bowler Irfan Pathan took five wickets and Laxmipathy Balaji took three wickets but it was not effective against Pakistan in which off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took four wickets
 australia kaa spin vibhaag main puraa daaromadar leg spinner bread hogg par tikaa he
 He has not disappointed the team by performing well so far but Australia have kept four fast bowlers in their attack
 yahi sthiti dakshin africa kii he jisane robin petersan ke rup main ekmaatr spinner rakhaa he
 Dale Steyn played a key role in South Africa's win over New Zealand
 unhone is match main 25 ran dekar chaar wicket liye
 He was well supported by Albie Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe
 tippaniyan Rangana Herath is the responsibility of hosts Sri Lanka's spin department but captain Mahela Jayawardene hinted in the practice matches that he would be more confident of his fast bowlers Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Shaminda Eranga and Tisara Perera
 westeindies ko jarur sunil narayan se karishmai pradarshan kii ummid he lekin abhyaas maichon main uske gendbaajon ne jo aath wicket liye unamem se chah tej gendbaajon ke khate main gaye
 Fidel Edwards, Ravi Rampal and captain Darren Sammy are his fast bowling trinity who are likely to play in every match
 pakistan ke paas said ajmal, shahid afridi or mohammad hafeez ke rup main upyogi spinner hai jo yahaan safal ho sakate hai lekin umr gul ab bhi team ke match vijeta gendbaaj hai
 In the practice match between Ireland and Zimbabwe, Irish spinner Alex Cusack took three wickets for six runs in three overs and played a key role in his team's victory but it should not be forgotten that the 13 wickets that fell in this match were ten wickets fast and medium
 The pace bowlers took it
 srilanka ke khilaaf match main tej gendbaaj irfan pathan ne paanch or lakshmipathi balaji ne teen wicket liye lekin pakistan ke khilaaf ye prabhavi nahin rahe jisamen of spinner ravichandran aswin ne chaar wicket hasil kiye

 Police found a minor son who murdered his mother and sister in Greater Noida, Gautam Budh Nagar, adjoining Delhi
 police ne mritka anjali ke faraar 15 varshiya bete ko varanasi se baraamad kiya
 The accused son can today make important disclosures about the intent of the murder, the manner of murder and some kind of conspiracy
 ladke ne poochtacha ke dauraan bataaya ki vah ghar se 1
 5 lakhs was taken, but the rupees were stolen along with the bag in the train
 ladkaa katl karne kii baat kabool kar rahaa he, lekin uskaa kahana he use nahin pataa ki usne kyon maar diya maa bahan ko
 Regarding the game, the police say that the task in this game is that you have to escape from the police by crime
 lekin is maamle main ladke ne khud phone kar pita ko apane varanasi main hone kii jaankaree di
 The minor son was already under suspicion due to his disappearance after the murder of the mother-daughter
 lekin police ke saamne ab ahm sawaal yah he ki varanasi pahunchane ke bich teen din vah kahaan-kahaan gaya, kin-kin se mila or varanasi se kiske number se apane pita ko phone kiya
 How this story reached from Greater Noida to Varanasi Later, first listen to the truth of the murder case that shook the entire NCR
 naaballig bete par apni maa-bahan kii hatya karne kaa shaq to usee vakt ho gaya tha jab ghar par maa-beti laash padi thi or betaa ghar se gaayab tha
 There were no signs of entering into the house, no signs of looting nor missing anything valuable
 sirf do laashen or ghar main rahane vaala teesraa sadsy gaayab
 But it was necessary to meet the son before any claim
 lihaaja is cese main police ke liye sabase ahm kadi betaa hi he
 Police have also recovered CCTV footage from the house
 in sisitivi footage main aaropee betaa aakhri baar dikhaa tha
 At 8:16 pm the first night, with the mother and sister coming home from the market, they are seen inside the elevator
 phir raat 11 bajkar 15 minute par usee lift se ghar se jate hue
 But this time his clothes are changed
 peeche bag he or haath main mobile phone
 Mother-daughter were murdered within these three hours
 lekin aaropee bete ke haav-bhav kattai ishaara nahin kar rahe ki vah do-do hatyaein karke ghar se niklaa he
 He gets out of the elevator comfortably and hands off a guard and leaves the car
 na koi dar na ghabrahat na shikan
 It is difficult to believe that a son can not take away his mother and sister only if they do not play mobile games 
 lekin internet ke andhere makadjaal or athaah gaharaaiyon main bhatakane vaale is jamaane ke bachche kya kuch kar guzar sakate hai, yah hamen blue whale game bataa chukaa he
 It is being said that the script of this sensational double murder of Greater Noida was also written in a similar game
 halanki hiskool gangster naam kaa yah internet game kisi ko aisi hinsa ke liye uksaane vaala ho is par police ko shaq he
 The police has also come to know that during interrogation of the neighborhood and the school, the accused is angry and has quarreled many times over trivial matters
 lekin kya ye gussa itnaa jaharila ho saktaa he ki apni maa or bahan kii jaan le le, vah bhi bat se peet-petakar
 No one is able to believe, neither the family nor the neighborhood nor the police
 aaropee bete kii giraftaar or uske jurm kabool karne ke baad greater noida main maa-beti ke katl kii gutthi sulajhati najar aa rahi he
 He has confessed to the murder of his mother and sister during interrogation
 shuukravaar kii raat police ne vaardaat ke baad se faraar chal rahe anjali ke bete ko varanasi se baraamad kiya
 Police said that the last location of the child was Paharganj on the basis of his mobile
 pahadganj se phir vah train pakadakar mughalsarai chalaa gaya
 From there he called his father on someone's phone on Friday morning
 pita ne fouran police ko isaki jaankaree di
 a police team immediately left for Varanasi by plane
 shuukravaar kii dopaher ko bachche ne kisi duusare vyakti ke phone se dobaaraa apane pita ko kol kiya
 On the number from which the phone was called, the police called and told the owner of the phone that this boy is being searched, keep an eye on him and tell the location to the police
 us vyakti kii madad se noida police ne bachche ko dashashwamedh ghat ke paas ghoomte hue pakad liya
 At that time the child was completely normal
 bachche ke paas se police ne mritka anjali kaa mobile bhi baraamad kar liya
 After getting caught, when the police questioned the boy, he confessed to the murder of his mother and sister
 vahiin aaropee bachche ke pita ne bataaya ki unhen unke bete ne mughalsarai se phone kiya tha, jisaki jaankaree unhone turant police ko di or police use dhundne main kaamyaab rahi
 The father of the accused child, saddened by the death of wife and daughter, said that he is not in a position to speak much yet and will be able to tell only after talking to the son
 noida police ke sutron ke mutabik bachche ne hi donon katl kiye the
 According to the police, the reason for the murder is being told to the crime fighter game
 sutron ke mutabik ladke ne bat se donon kii peet-peet kar hatya kii thi
 Now the police is coming to Noida on Saturday
 isse pehle der shaam noida ke esaspi lav kumaar ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya tha ki mritka ke parivaar, doston, ilaake ke logon or skool main staff, students se poochtacha karne par pataa chalaa he ki anjali kaa betaa agressive pravriti kaa he
 He gets angry more
 unke soshal media ke madhyam se har railway stesan, metro stesan, bas stand or ensiaar sahit puure desh main use talash kiya ja rahaa tha
 It is worth mentioning that on Tuesday night, when the lock in the flat number 1446 of Tower g of Gaur City Two in Greater Noida was broken, the corpse of blood-soaked mother-daughter was found in it
 donon kii is berahami se hatya kii gai ki dekhne vaale sann rah gaye the
 When this incident happened, there were a total of three people in the house
 maa, beti or betaa
 But when the door opened, the dead body of the mother and daughter was missing
 donon laashon ke paas hi ek bat padaa hua mila tha, jis par khun ke nishaan the
 Police also got a sharp weapon from the spot
 magar nahin mila to 15 saal kaa betaa
 Till then it seemed as if someone had killed the mother-daughter and kidnapped the son
 darasal wo flats agarwal family kaa he
 Whose business is tiles
 4 taarikh kii shaam se parivaar ke log ghar me maujuud maa or bacchon se sampark karne kii koshish kar rahe the lekin jab kai ghanton tak koi sampark nahi hua tab unhone ghar ke paas rah rahe rishteradaaron se sampark saadhaa
 When relatives arrived home
 tab flats baahar se band tha or newspaper baahar padaa tha
 When he broke the window and peeped inside, he saw the corpse of mother Anjali and daughter, near whom the police was informed
 ladke ke mamaa ne bhi media se baatcheet ke dauraan apil kii ki is tarah ke mobile game band hone chahie, jisase kisi kii jaan chali jaae

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has welcomed the rebuke from the Supreme Court over the controversial statement made by Rahul Gandhi on the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi
 bataa den ki rahul gandhi ne maharashtra ke sonaale main beeti chah march ko ek chunavi raily main kaha tha ki rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne gandhiji kii hatya kii thi
 After this, Rajesh Kunte, secretary of the Bhiwandi unit of the union, filed a defamation case against the Congress vice president
 aresas ke pravaktaa manmohan vaid ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki desh kii sarvocch adaalat ne congress party kii jhooth or tathyaheen dushprachaar kii asaliyat sabake saamne khol kar rakh di he
 At the same time, in this case, the Supreme Court asked Rahul Gandhi to either apologize for his controversial statement or face trial
 court ne spasht shabdon main kaha, 'agar aap maafee nahin maangate hai to aapako trial phase karnaa hi hoga
 'in this entire case, the Supreme Court said that you should be cautious when you speak about any person or institution
 supreme court ne kaha ki nathuram godse ne gandhiji ko maaraa aurareses ke logone gandhiji ko maaraa, in donon baton main bahut fark he
 While Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's petition was being heard in the Supreme Court, Rahul Gandhi has demanded the cancellation of a case related to criminal defamation running against him in a lower court of Maharashtra
 maamle kii agali sunwaayee 27 july ko hogi
 After the rebuke of the court to Rahul Gandhi, the Sangh feels that by adding Nathuram Godse, the killer of Mahatma Gandhi, to the RSS, the opponents have always blamed the Sangh for Mahatma Gandhi, their speech will stop
 in sab ke baavjood sangh shaayad is baat se inkaar nahin kar saktaa he ki nathuram godse sangh kaa swanyasvek rahaa he

 These rules broadly include internet blocking, more or less net speed for a particular website or zero rating internet data

 Significantly, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) gave a framework to the government only last year
 net neutrality kaa yah fremawork bharat main lambey samay se chale aa rahe net neutrality campan ke baad aayaa
 The campaign started in India on Net Neutrality when Facebook was preparing to bring internet ORG
 iske tahat kisi khaas sarvice ke liye free internet dene kaa praavdhaan tha
 In India, it was fiercely opposed and due to this Facebook had to pull back
 report ke mutabik is nae niyam main saaf taur par likhaa he internet cholekar data ke saath kisi bhi tarahaka bhedbhaav nahin ho saktaa he
 In this, blocking, speed reduction or giving more speed for a particular content has been banned

 This includes autonomous vehicle and surgery operations

 s

 Internet service providers will now have to agree to these conditions while signing an agreement with the Department of Telecom and must also sign it at the time of the license agreement
 report ke mutabik agar koi bhi internet sarvice prowider is niyam kaa ulanghan karata he to uskaa license cancil kiya ja saktaa he

 kyonki jin companiyon ne internet sarvice se qaraar karenge sirf unke contant yujar ke paas teji se khulenge jabaki jinhone sarvice prowider se qaraar nahin kiya he unke contant slo khul sakate hai
 This can be a major problem if there is no net neutrality
 gauratlab he ki net neutrality shabd kaa pehali baar istemaal colombia uniwarsity main media lau ke professor team vu ne kiya tha
 According to this principal, any service provider will give equal status to any content, data and applications of the Internet
 koi bhi website or pej tab tak nahin block kiye jaae jab tak ki us par koi gaiyr kanoonee tathy na ho
 This means that the Internet will give equal space to all the websites, big and small
 TRAI ne ne is sarkaar ko di gai sifarish main kaha tha, ‘internet sarvice us siddhant par chalanaa chahie jisamen koi bhedbhaav na ho yaa kisi contant ko lekar alag ravaiya na ho
 This includes slowing down the Internet for a particular service or blocking any content
 ’TRAI ne kaha he ki sarvice prowider or mobile telecom operators kisi ko koi bhi aisa samjhauta nahin karnaa chahie jisamen contant bhedbhaav jaisi chijen hon

 kendriya grih mantri ke rup main ab jo chunautiyaan unke saamne hai, ve durjey hai
 Among them, the biggest problem is that of Jammu and Kashmir which has been under President's rule and later Governor's rule for the last one year

 Under the existing law, the government will have to re-constitute a new Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly to repeal Article 370 and bring them together to abolish Article 370

 Article 35A, which defines the privileges of permanent residents of the state, Shah wants to remove it through an executive order
 unka maananaa he ki yah rajya or desh ke liye bura he kyonki yah jammu or kashmir ko apni kshamta ke purna vikaas se roktaa he
 They feel that the purpose of Article 35A is Islamization of Jammu and Kashmir, especially Jammu region
 gauratlab he ki anuchhed 35e ko is aadhaar par nirast karne kii baat ho rahi he ki yah kanoon bahari logon ko rajya main sampatti kharidne se roktaa he lekin aise pratibandhi kanoon himachal pradesh or sikkim main pehle se maujuud hai, isliye keval jammu-kashmir ko hi kyon nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Shah is also considering delimitation of assembly seats in Jammu and Kashmir to remove the existing 'inequality' between the Valley and Jammu regions

 They are also contemplating the old RSS proposal to divide Jammu and Kashmir into three parts, with Jammu and Kashmir as two states and Ladakh as a union territory
 sangh parivaar ke vichaarkon kaa maananaa he ki yah swat: hi anuchhed 370 ko bekaar kar degaa
 Also, before proceeding with the strategy of repealing this article, Shah's Home Ministry will have to devise a strategy to end the terrorist network of Jammu and Kashmir
 vastav main, aise kathor kadam ke baad sambhavit hinsa ko rokane kii yah anivarya jarurat he
 An RSS thinker says: "if Article 370 is to be sidelined, the division of Jammu and Kashmir is a good proposal
 yahaan tak ki pakistan jo pioke main sthaneey logon ke virodh kaa saamana kar rahaa he, ne bhi haal hi main virodh ko failane se rokane ke liye gilgit-blatistan kshetra ko ek kanoonee madhyam se alag kar diya
 India can use this as a strategic argument dividing Jammu and Kashmir
 ''lekin jammu-kashmir ko teen hisson main baantne se bharat par rajya ko dharmik aadhaar—ghati ko muslim, jammu ko hindu or ladakh ko baudhon ke pradesh ke rup main baantne ke prayaason ke aarope lagenge

" Will do
 jaahir he, dhulmul nazariye kaa daur ab peeche chhot chukaa he
 Much needed ruthlessness will be seen in dealing with pro-pakistan elements in the valley
 ''jammu-kashmir main kaam kar chuke ek purv police adhikari kehete hai: ''gilaani, yaccin malik or mirwij jaise algaavvaadi netaaon ke khilaaf modi sarkaar ne kai kaarywahiyon ke saath jameen taiyaar kii he, jisase sanket miltaa he ki bharat ab keval ghati ke bharat samarthak logon se hi baat karegaa
 The separatist leaders from behind the scenes have been supported by the Indian governments of the past
 ab yah khatm ho jayega
 Shah has to take Kashmir policy to the next level
 ''ye adhikari kehete hai ki iskaa matlab maare gaye aatankwaadiyon ke rishtedaaron ko antim sanskaar ke janaaje kaa juluus nikaalane kii anumati nahin milegi (israel kii tarah jahaan sarkaar maare gaye aatankwaadiyon kii kabron ke bare main kisi ko nahin bataati)
 Also, steps will be taken to strengthen the intelligence network and encourage the liberal Islamic cultural traditions of the valley
 ram mandir kii phansashri ram janmabhumi nyaas or vibhinn anya sanghathanon se jude saadhuon ne ayodhya main ram mandir ke nirmaan ke liye kavayad shuru kar di he

 ve ram janmabhumi nyaas maamle ke mukhya vaadiyon main se ek hai
 This land 2
 77 acre vivaadit bhoomi se alag he jahaan kabhi babari masjid thi
 This 67-acre land was acquired by the Narasimha Rao government in 1993 on the condition that it would be freed after the decision to transfer the disputed land to Hindus or Muslims
 maamle main 2010 ke elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke faisle main kaha gaya tha ki bhoomi kaa do-tihaai hissaa maamle ke do hindu vaadiyon ko diya jaae or ek tihaai sunni muslim vakf board ko diya jayega, lekin supreme court main ek apil lambit hone ke kaaran upie sarkaar ne koi kadam nahin uthaaya
 The previous Modi government too remained silent till January 2019
 jab aam chunaav sir par aae to usne sheersh adaalat main ek aavedan diya, jisamen adhigrahit bhoomi nyaas ko hastantarit karne kii anumati maangi gai thi
 Significantly, when spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar started efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue with the Muslim leadership, the RSS and Shah opposed it and said that the issue should be resolved through the court
 ram mandir sambhavat: ek mudda he jahaan ek taraf shah or sangh parivaar hai or duusari taraf modi
 The Prime Minister reportedly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue in hopes of better hindu-muslim relations in the future
 duusari ore, shah or aresas ram mandir ke mudde par ek sakht niti ke paksh main hai kyonki unka maananaa he ki yahi muslim samudaay main maujuud kattarpanthi tatwon se nipatane kaa ekmaatr sahi tarika he
 Other challenges: During the last five years, the number of Maoist-affected districts has come down from 126 to 90 and the policies of the Modi government and former Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh have played a major role in this
 modi sarkaar ne ek kadam aage badhkar tathakthith 'shahari naksaliyon' par nakel kasni shuru kar di
 The government termed the leftist intellectuals as urban naxalites, whom the government believes are the subversives of underground Maoists as a result of the ideological inspiration of these intellectuals
 ek mahatvapurn suraksha mudda, jis par modi sarkaar ne aswabhaavik rup se kamjor ichhashakti dikhaai, vah he police sudhaaron kaa mudda
 The roadmap for police reform was prepared by Prakash Singh, former Director General of Border Security Force (BSF), who approached the Supreme Court to make it legally accepted
 prakaash singh kaa kahana he ki modi sarkaar ne police vyavastha main sudhaar ke liye kuch nahin kiya he
 Among the suggestions he has made is to strengthen police infrastructure (in the form of manpower, transport, communication and forensic support) by building special police units like Andhra Pradesh in every state, giving the CBI a legal recognition so that it can be used by politicians Vohra could not become a special all-india, like MCOCA (maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, 1999) to control organized crime
 Recommends five major reforms, including putting Nun and the police from the state list to the concurrent list so that the center also has some role in developing the state's police force
 nishchit rup se, shah ke aagaman ke saath bharat ke aantarik suraksha kshetra main sakht rashtrawaad kaa ek nayaa adhyay shuru ho gaya he
 But the challenges are also many
 mantralay ke paas aparaadh or aapraadhik trekking network or system (sisitianes) or natgrid yaa rashtriya khufia grid database jaisi kai yojanaayen vichaaradhin yaa adhuri padi hai
 They are very important for monitoring the activities of terrorists and sharing intelligence among police forces

 bispi netaa ne saaf kiya ki unki party desh kii sabhi 543 loksabhaa siton par akele chunaav ladegi or kisi bhi party se koi raajnneetik talmail nahin kiya jayega

 But there is no truth in all this

 On the argument of Congress leaders responsible for the sp-congress riots that if the bsp's Dalit vote bank and the Congress's Muslim vote bank come together, it will be invincible, said Satish Chandra Mishra that Muslims are completely with the BSP
 unke mutabik mayawati ke siem rahete ek bhi danga nahin hua
 Riots are taking place in the SP Raj and the Congress sitting at the Center is doing nothing
 aise main ye raajnneetik dal kis aadhaar par alpsankhyakon par prabhaav kaa daawa kar sakate hai
 Modi has no influence in UP, while dismissing Narendra Modi's impact in UP, Satish Chandra Mishra said that the bjp's mutual head-foot is not over yet
 rahul gandhi par mishra bole ki unke raajnneetik karishme kaa kya hashr hua ye uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon ke nateezon se saaf he
 Numbers are not known, while talking about the Third Front's third front and the possible role of BSP in this, Satish Chandra Mishra said that it is a joke

 malavat purna ne dakshin africa kii sabase oonchi chotii mount kilimanjaro par apni byopic film kaa pehla poster launch kiya

 bharat ke swatantraaa diwas kii shaam ko purna ne yaheen jhanda fahraaya or apni film kaa pehla poster 19 hajaar 3 sau 41 feet se jari kar diya
 The makers of the film 'poorna' made a unique marketing plan to release its first look, for which they resorted to the summit on August 15, 2016 at Kilimejaro peak in South Africa and its face became Poorna itself
 10 agast ko malavat purna ne apni yatra shuru kii saath main unhone film ke do waterpruf poster rakh liye the
 Poorna completed her ascent on 15 August and at the same time she also launched the poster from there
 vishwa cinema ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka he jab kisi film ke first luk ko itani unchai se launch kiya gaya he
 Poorna is a film produced and directed by Rahul Bose, which has set a new benchmark in front of other films in terms of promotion
 rahub bose kehete hai, 'jab hamane ye suna ki purna 15 agast kii summit ke liye kilimanjaro chotii par ja rahi hai to mujhe idia soojha kii kyon naa unki byopic film kaa pehla luk vahiin se wo khud launch kar den

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar interacted with Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh over phone over the rising water level of Ganga and devastation in Sarkar Bihar by breaking the Farakka Dam
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne grahamantri se aagrah kiya kibihar main gangaake adhyayan ke liye vaise visheshgyon ko bhejein jinke dimag puri tarah khule hon
 The Chief Minister clearly believes that the condition of Ganga in Bihar is because of the Farakka Dam
 ganga main gaad (silt) ke jamane ke kaaran ganga main pani kaa jalastr badhata he or aasapaas ke ilaake main fail jaataa he
 He also told Home Minister Rajnath Singh that breaking the Farakka dam is the solution to the problem
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kaha ki pichley 10-15 varshon se bihar main ganga kii durdasha kaa maamla centre ke saamne uthaata rahaa hum lekin centre sarkaar he ki sunne kaa naam hi nahin leti
 Whether it is Manmohan Singh's government at the center or Narendra Modi's government, there has been a continuous voice about the plight of Ganga
 lekin samasya ke samaadhaan kii baat to dur us par vichaar-vimarsh tak nahin hua
 Nitish Kumar said that even when Pawan Bansal was the Secretary of Water Resources during the tenure of the UPA Government, he had spoken of breaking the Farakka Dam

 ’’ donon hi purv rail mantri rahe hai
 Kharge told reporters in the Parliament House complex, "this is a well-written budget speech

 It is an idea, a dream but the important thing is how will you get there? All this has been talked about in the future, but there is a 50 per cent decline in your current financial condition
 is antar ko kaise paatenge
 '' trivedi ne kaha, ‘‘main dekh rahaa hum ki railway air india ke raste par ja rahi he
 Its treasure is empty
 ’’ Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav lauded the railway budget, saying that it avoided populist measures like the announcement of new trains and that Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu took good steps by focusing on completing the projects started in the last budget
 
 mulaayam ne kaha, ‘‘badhiya kaam hua he
 Prabhu did not announce new plans and insisted on implementing the previous measures

 varisht shivasena netaa or uttar pashchim mumbai se saansad gajanan kirtikar ne kaha, ‘‘ham bajet se puri tarah asantusht hai
 He has said many things in the budget
 lekin kahaan se aayega paisa?’’ unhone iske saath hi kaha ki bajet ne har kisi ko ‘‘andhkaar’’ main rakhaa he
 Kirtikar said, "the Railway Minister is talking about increasing the height of the platforms for which Rs 97 crore is needed
 yadi inhen puraa karnaa he to ek hi baar main in pariyojnaon ke liye dhan aavantit karnaa hoga
 They are talking about doubling and trifling of lines but which lines will they work on? They have kept us in the dark
 ’’ Another senior Shiv Sena leader, Chandrakant Khare, sarcastically said, "the budget is good but difficult to understand
 ’’ Parliamentary Affairs Minister m Venkaiah Naidu rejected the criticism of the opposition on the railway budget that there was no element in it
 unhone ise ‘‘vaastavik or tathyaatmak’’ bataate hue kaha ki rajg sarkaar ne purv kii sarkaron ke kaarykaal ke adhure vaadon ko puraa karne kii sari jimmedaari apane kandhon par lee he
 On the opposition's criticism of not announcing any new trains, Naidu questioned how many new trains and promises of new rail lines announced in the past have been fulfilled? He said that this budget is definitely going to ensure "speed, safety, safety and satisfaction for railway passengers"
 ’’ Khare said, "people will ask us what the region got from the budget? Now the budget will have to be read and only then something will be told
 ’’ biju janata dal ke varisht netaa tathagat satpathi ne bhi rail bajet kii aalochana karte hue ise khokhla or niraashajanak bataaya
 He said that he would give this budget only two out of ten

 Actually, that beauty made such a pretense of giving heart that the constable sahab got trapped in his net and lost 70 thousand rupees
 police consteble ko tab hosh aayaa, jab sundari furr ho gai

 Something happened that a constable named Madan Paswan was coming to Jehanabad from Gaya riding in a passenger train
 jis seat par wo baitha tha, uski bagal main ek chota baccha liye ek sundar yuvati bhi baithi thi
 In just an hour's journey from Gaya to Jehanabad, Sundari trapped the constable in sweet and sweet things
 us yuvati ne pyaar-muhabbat kaa aisa naatak rachaa ki consteble kaa dil us par aa gaya
 Meanwhile, the two exchanged each other's mobile numbers
 bataaya jaataa he ki jahanabad stesan par utar kar yuvati ne prem kii pehali nishaani ke rup main uphaar dilaane kii baat consteble se kii
 The constable, who was going madly in love with the girl, did not see nor come and took her to a jewelery shop in Jehanabad
 us yuvati ne dukaan se 70 hajaar rupee mulya kii sone kii ek chen or ek mangalsutra kharid liya
 After taking the jewelry, the girl showed her true color
 vah bachche ko bahaane se lekar dukaan se nikali or phir lautakar nahin ai
 The poor constable kept waiting
 lekin vomahiladobaraa unhen najar nahin ai
 Now the poor constable fell
 uske paas dukandaar ko dene ke liye paryaapt rupee bhi nahin the
 But the shopkeeper insisted on paying the jewel's money and did not let the constable leave

 People reached the city police station with that constable

 However, Surjewala also says that demonetisation has caused such a huge loss to the economy that no one can fully compensate it, but the Prime Minister should give relief to the farmers, small shopkeepers and businessmen and housewives who are suffering from demonetisation
 congress pravaktaa surajevaala ne kaha, party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne piem modi ke saamne ye maange rakhi hai
 This is not the demands of the Congress party, but the demands and expectations of the people, so do not dismiss it as Rahul Gandhi's demand

 Recently, the picture of some children went viral, in which some children were studying on the sack in the midst of the mess
 daawa kiya gaya ki ye gujarat ke sarkari skulon kaa haal he
 It also claimed that the government spends 4000 crores on Kumbh but cannot spend 400 crores on children's education
 india today anti phek news war room (AFWA) ne paaya ki ye tasviir gujarat kii to nahin he lekin madhya pradesh ke sagar jile ke ek sarkari skool kii he
 The post was shared on the Facebook page 'priyanka Gandhi - future of India' on 16 July
 kai or fasebuk yugers ne is bhraamak post ko share kiya
 With the help of reverse search we found an article in the English newspaper Hindustan Times in which the same picture has been taken from another angle
 lekh ke mutabik ye tasviir sagar jile ke parpsoria gaanv ke primary skool kii he
 Here children are forced to study like this because there is no electricity in the class
 ye khabar janvari 2019 main patrkaar anupam pateria ne likhi thi
 By then, the Congress government had arrived in Madhya Pradesh
 hamen khud anupam ne is khabar kii pushti kii
 Another claim was made in this news that 4000 crores were spent on Kumbh
 isaki padtaal karne par hamen akhabaaron kikhbarmili, jinke mutabik upi sarkaar ne is baar elahabaad main hue ardhakumbh par 4200 karod rupee kharch kiye jo abtak ke itihaas main sabase zyada he
 Although the talk of spending 400 crores on education is wrong, the government has allocated an additional amount of 400 crores in the budget of 2019-20 on education so that world-class institutions can be created
 2019-20 main shiksha par sarkaar kaa kul bajet kareeb ₹94,854 karod rupee he
 According to Business Today, in 2018-19, the government spent about 83000 thousand crores on education
 is tarah kaha ja saktaa he ki bacchon kii tasviir ke saath kiye gaye sabhi daawey galat or bhraamak hai

 After the new government in Maharashtra, only 40 percent of the country is ruled by BJP or allies, which was 71 percent in December 2017
 haalanki puure desh main bhaajapa ke raaj ke baavjood hamen sabase ziddee mandi ne dhar liya lekin centre va rajya ke rishton kaa nayaa rasayan ab nitigat chunauti badhayega
 The role of states in economic development has become more central than the center
 bharat ko mandi se nikaalane kaa daaromadar 12 tej vikaas dar vaale rajyon par he
 Goa, Chandigarh, Delhi, Puducherry, Haryana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, Himachal, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttarakhand today host 50 percent of the country's GDP and about 58 percent of consumers
 iske baad duusari shrenee madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, odisha jaise bade or sambhaavnamay rajyon kii he
 Adding Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, Bengal, Telangana etc
 on the latest political map, about 59 percent GDP is now under the control of non-bjp ruled governments

 This is the beginning of a vicious cycle as the huge debt of the states actually goes towards repaying the previous debt
 • Most demand in the economy comes from the expenditure of the states
 puri arthvyavastha main rajyon kaa kareeb 91 fisadi kharch sanbhaalane vaale 18 rajyon kaa kharch saal kii pehali timahi main bilkul nahin badha jabaki mandi se ubarne ke liye isaki sabase zyada jarurat thi

 Now most states can get caught in the vicious cycle of high deficit and low growth

 The new political map of the country is not good news for GST

 There are major changes in the GST to bring petro-products, real estate under the GST regime, streamline the tax structure and comply with regulations, but now the Council will be dominated by the opposition, especially the big opposition ruled states

 States that are troubled by the delay in getting damages from GST can move towards breaking the discipline of GST

 'splacedeta' kii yah suchi aise lakhon-karodon password ko khangale jane ke baad taiyaar kii gai he, jo varsh 2013 ke dauraan li hue or online post kar die gaye
 
 
 In the list of the 25 worst passwords, many passwords are just four letters (or characters), or only numbers or letters are used in them
 
 
 kuch ne sirf unheen websiton ke naam ko password bana diya he, jinhen ve istemaal karte hai
 
 
 The English keyboard's first line of letters and the letter identity of the keyboard 'qwerty' is ranked fourth in the list, while 'iloveyou' is at number ninth
 
 
 'splacedeta' ke mutabik, sabase ghatiya password kii yah vaarshik suchi jari karnaa password protection kii disha main logon ko jaagruk karne ke uddeshy se uthaaya gaya kadam he
 
 
 According to 'splashdata', a firm that sells password management software, it can be beneficial to use a good password manager that can automatically login to websites so that users can create strong passwords, and they don't have to remember 
 
 
 'splacedeta' dwaara di gai anya mahatvapurn tips main numberon athwa aksharon ke vikalpon (udhaaharan ke liye 'p4s$w0rd') ke istemaal se bachanaa or ek hi yuzaranem or password ke ek se zyaada website yaa services ke liye istemaal karne se bachanaa shaamil he
 
 
 According to the company, using long passwords combining letters and numbers is more secure, and if possible, longer sentences can also be used, which may contain multiple words, with spaces in between
 
 
 vaise, varsh 2013 ke sabase ghatiya 25 password is prakaar hai

 yahi vajah he ki chadhate dollar se tel companiyon kaa munafa kam ho jayega
 According to the data, if the rupee weakens to 1 rupee against the dollar, then the oil companies have to bear a loss of around Rs 9,000 crore
 dollar ke mukaable rupee main giravat kaa hi asar he ki toyota or general motors sahit kai vaahan companiyaan gadiyon ke daam badhaane par vichaar kar rahi hai
 The fall in the rupee has a bad effect on the auto companies
 aisi companiyaan kareeb 50 fisadi kal-purje kaa bhi aayaat karti hai
 On whose face the smile will float, due to the weakness of some sectors there is bound to be a wave of happiness
 maal niryaat karne vaali companiyon ko isse phayda hona tay he
 Other sectors that have income in dollars will also benefit
 iti, pharma, hotel aadi kuch aise sector hai, jinka munafa dollar ke upar chadhane se badhegaa
 The special thing here is that ONGC and Reliance Industries are expected to benefit from rupee weakness, as these companies sell natural gas dollars to their customers
 gauratlab he ki ek dollar kii keemat kareeb 60 rupee ho gai he
 This is the lowest level of Rs

 Stating that the opposition's responsibility for the events in the last two months of Bihar's Patnitish government was unfounded, the BJP claimed that the current government's claims of development and good governance had evaporated along with justice
 bijepi ke varisht netaa or purv upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne nitish sarkaar ke bihar main haal main ghatit ghatnaon ke liye vipaksh ko jimmevaar tehraae jane ko niraadhaar bataaya or daawa kiya ki vartmaan sarkaar ke nyaay ke saath vikaas or sushasan ke daawey kii hawa nikal gayi he
 Modi alleged that earlier there was a working and sensitive government (JDU government) in Bihar, now there is only a talk-less sensitive government
 unhone nitish sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki puraa bihar jal rahaa he or roj ghatnaayen ghat rahi hai
 Modi referred to inciting riots in Bettiah and Nawada in recent times and other incidents, including the rise of incidents of rape of women by the Maoists in Gurura in the last fortnight, increasing the incidence of rape of women
 Accused of falling significantly and said that during the last two months, the Iqbal of the government was over
 susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki jab sarkaar kamjor hoti he to vah har baat ke liye vipaksh ko jimmevaar tehraati he isliye chaahe vah bodhgaya silsilewar bam dhamaakaa, saaran jila vishakt mid-de mil maut maamla ho, chapakal ke pani kaa dooshit hone kaa maamla ho yaa phir bagaha, betia or navada main danga bhadakne kii ghatnaayen hon in sabhi ghatnaon se logon kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye vipaksh ko jimmevaar tehraakar bihar kii vartmaan sarkaar aisa hi kar rahi he
 He challenged Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to learn this art of accusing the opposition from his old ally and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad by proving that the opposition was behind these incidents
 modi ne kaha ki shahid javaanon ke shav ke patna aane par bihar ke koi mantri hawaii adda par nahin pahunchaa
 The Chief Minister present in Delhi at that time could have paid homage to these martyrs there but neither he himself went nor sent any of his ministers
 modi ne kaha ki mantriyon ko bhejnaa mukhyamantri kaa daayitv tha isliye iske liye mantriyon ko doshi nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 He said that the ministers were later instructed to leave with such delay that except for one place, the ministers at three other places could not attend the funeral of the martyrs
 nitish sarkaar main shaamil krishi mantri narendra singh ko shaheedon ko lekar die gaye bayaan par unhen jediu dwaara kaaran bataao notice die jane par modi ne kaha ki aise varisht mantri ko notice diya janaa unka apmaan he
 He said that if he had been in his place, he would have resigned from the post of minister
 modi ne kaha ki saare ghatnakram main agar kisi ko notice di jaani chahie to mukhyamantri ko notice di jaani chahie
 Claiming that Bihar was in the grip of severe drought, Sushil Kumar Modi said that according to the data, the state has received 27 percent less rainfall than normal and rainfall in 11 districts is 50 percent less than normal and 24 districts 35 percent less than normal
 There has been rain, which has reduced the sowing of paddy by 65 percent
 unhone kaha ki varsh 2010 main saamaanya se 21 pratishat kam varsha hone par sookhaa ghoshit kiya ja saktaa tha to is varsh saamaanya se 27 pratishat kam varsha hone par bhi rajya sarkaar bihar ko sookhaa grast pradesh ghoshit kyon nahin kar rahi he
 Modi said that a BJP delegation would meet the Governor and urge him to pressurize the government for this
 chaara ghotaale ko lekar argedy supremeo lalu prasad kii yachika ko supreme court dwaara khaarij kar die jane ke bare main puche jane par modi ne kaha ki isse nyaaypalika ke prati logon kaa vishwaas badhegaa
 Modi also feared the Congress-led UPA government at the Center for misusing the CBI to save the RJD and JDU leaders

 purv bhartiya captain sunil gavaskar kaa maananaa he ki ab samay aa gaya he ki team prabandhan aakraamak or prayogtmak baaten band kare or acha cricket khilne par dhyaan lagaae
 It is shameful that the team lost that India had suffered an embarrassing defeat by 63 runs while chasing a target of 176 runs in the fourth innings on the fourth day of the first Test in Galle
 bharat kii duusari pari main lankai spinner rangana herath ne saat wicket chatkaaye jisase bharat 112 ranon par hi dher ho gaya
 On playing instead of talking, Dhyanagavaskar said, 'I think we should stop talking about aggression, experimentalism and whatever else is there
 mujhe lagata he ki hamen khel par dhyaan lagaana chahie or khel khelnaa shuru kar dena chahie
 We do not need to give any clarification about how we will play cricket
 aapako aisa cricket khelnaa he jo aapaki team ke anukool ho, jo us sthiti ke anukool ho jisamen aapaki team he, us pich ke anukool ho jis par aap khel rahe hai or us virdohi ko dekhte hue aapke anukool ho jiske khilaaf aap khel rahe hai
 "there should be a win in every situation," Lakshgavaskar continued, "and this is the only way to play cricket
 aakraamak cricket ko lekar baat or anya baaten ab band ho jaani chahie or aapako sirf achche cricket par dhyaan lagaana chahie
 This is the most important thing, playing good cricket, it does not matter whether it is defensive cricket or aggressive cricket, in the end you want your team to win, it is normal

 But with the help of Dinesh Chandimal's unbeaten 162 in the second innings, Sri Lanka returned and later the spinners gave the hosts a win
 ye haar thi sabase zyada niraashaajanakagavaskar ne kaha, 'yah bharat kii sabase niraashajanak haaron main se ek he
 Because after getting such a big lead you are expected to win
 lekin itani badi badhat lene ke baavjood bharat donon duusari pariyon main ummid ke mutabik pradarshan nahin kar paaya
 Even when he was bowling to Sri Lanka and even when he came out to bat in the fourth innings
 maine kaha tha ki agar bharat ko 170 ke aasapaas lakshya mila to yah kaaphi kadi chunauti hogi
 Gavaskar still believes that India has the talent to make a comeback in the next two matches
