 First of all, it was welcomed with the thunderous applause that the national anthem would be played every time before any film was screened in theaters
 is dauraan tirangaa screen par dikhegaa or logon ko khadey hona anivaary hoga
 What better option can there be to put words like patriotism and patriotism in every heart and to communicate the national sentiment by the people
 lekin yahaan ek ahm sawaal bhi he
 Whether the Supreme Court has all the responsibility to express patriotism and teach the lesson of patriotism and we citizens have no duty
 yah to vahi baat hui ki har chiz ham tabhi karenge kya jab supreme court hamase kahegaa
 For example, the Supreme Court will ask you to plant crops, worship your gods, honor your parents, keep India unbroken, ask mango trees to give mangoes, ask rivers to provide water
 aisa to nahin ho saktaa
 Some of us citizens also have a duty
 or jab baat deshbhakti kii ho, rashtriya bhaavana kii ho to yah or bhi zaruri ho jaataa he ki ham na kevalcourt ke aadesh kaa paalankaren balki usase 10 qadam aage jaakar kuch aisa kar guzaren jo deshbhakti kii bhaavana se hamaare dilon kii sukhi naaliyon ko sinchit kar de
 For example, if you are eating food, sing the national anthem before eating
 isse aapke man or bhojan main rashtriya bhaavana kaa sanchaar hoga
 You will feel that you are eating for the country
 aapkaa nakam, desh kaa namak he
 The energy you will earn by eating it will work for the country
 aaj se shaadi ho yaa mrityubhoj, mess ho yaa club, ghar kaa peeda ho yaa dining teble kii kursiyaan, khaanaa khaane se pehle saavdhaan hokar khadey hon or raashtragan gaayen, phir khaaen
 Alcohol is a bad thing, but this country also belongs to alcoholics
 or sharaabi bhale hi bure maane jate hon, deshadrohi to nahin hote na
 Singing the national anthem should be made mandatory for those queuing outside liquor contracts
 agar koi puraa raashtragan nahin ga paa rahaa he yaa uski zabaan ladkadaa rahi he to samaj lijie ki yah ab sharaab pine ke yogya nahin
 Rather, such a rule should be implemented before every peg
 jo josh main hosh kho de or raashtragan na ga paae, use sharaab chune kii ijazat nahin honi chahie
 The third important thing is the tide of patriotism among our children
 wo abhimanyu jaise bane, bharat kii tarah ek bharat vaali kahani ke paatr bane
 This is very important and for this, it is important that you sing the national anthem in a careful pose before coitus
 maithun se pehle raashtragan aapako rashtraprem se bhar degaa
 This will directly affect your child
 or to or, rashtraprem kaa jowar aapaki nason main jab daudega, aapke napunsak rah jane kii koi gunjaaish nahin bachegi
 Do not dirty your conscience by forcibly singing hymns on various types of film tunes when you are outside the shivala or in a Birla temple or any Bhairav dham, Mother's Durbar, Thakurdwara type place
 Do it vahaan saavdhaan khadey hokar raashtragan gaayen
 Your gods belong to your country
 aap desh ke hai
 There is no strong connection
 phir, jab raashtragan ke saath aap mandir main daakhil honge, aap deshbhakti or devbhakti ke sagar main khud ko paar hota paaenge
 The fifth is to make the national anthem mandatory in hospitals
 agar aisa hoga to upachaar kar rahaa doctor deshbhakti ke bhav main duba hua aapako apana shikaar nahin, apana bhai samajhegaa or kam paise main behatar ilaaj karke degaa
 You too will not look right yourself, but will be determined to recover soon for the country
 opidi kaa parchaa, dawa kii line, eksre mashin, oparation theatre, trama centre, har jagah bas 52 second kaa saavdhaan
 Then either you lie on the stator or sit on the stool
 lekin 52 senkad to desh ke liye banate hi hai
 The sixth is very common
 cigarette or bidi aap baithkar pinaa band kiijie
 Stand and drink
 or cigarette jalaane se pehle aap puraa raashtragan gaayen
 There will be two benefits from this
 ek to yah ki rashtrabhakti kaa jowar aapako kam cigarette pine ke liye prerit karegaa
 The spirit you get from cigarettes or bidis will not be less than the elation after singing the national anthem
 or doosraa laabh yah ki haath main liter yaa maachis lekar khadey aadmi ko dekhakar log samaj jaaenge ki aap dhumrapan karne vaale hai or is tarah pasive smoking ke liye ek chetavanee jari ho jaaegi
 The seventh is a little finer
 koi bhi vyakti shankaaon se mukt nahin he
 Two doubts haunt everyone everyday
 laghushanka or dirghashanka
 But do not doubt about singing the national anthem
 pressure ho saktaa he tej ho par desh ke liye 52 second banate hai
 When you get up after a short talk or after a long talk, you still wash your hands and feet while singing a film song
 to kya 52 second desh ko nahin de sakate
 Sing first and then do even better
 are iskaa sabase bada laabh yah hoga ki rashtriya bhaavana se bharaa vyakti kisi saarvajanik sthaan, diwaar, gali ko ganda karne se bachegaa or yathasthaan hi shankaanivaaran karegaa
 The eighth is very fresh
 atm kii line main khadey yuva jab apane mobilon par video dekhte yaa game khelte dikhaai dete hai to maa kasam khun khul jaataa he
 Is this why our revolutionaries gave sacrifices? kya isi ke liye hamaare sainik simaaon par jaan kii baazi lagaae khadey hai
 And there is no need to stand here specifically
 khadey to aap hai hi
 Just get started
 raashtragan gaaie
 Can also sing again and again if the number is delayed
 isse kaledhan ke prati ek nakaaratmakataa aapke man main aegi
 And you will be motivated to spend your money in the national interest
 naunva mauka thodaa nijee he lekin nijitv desh ko kuch de sake, aisi soch honi chahie
 For example, you want a kiss or a hug with your partner, a hug from a friend or relative
 holi yaa id par kisi ko badhai dena chaahate hon, dikshant samaaroh main puraskrit ho rahe hon yaa kisi chunavi sabha main bhaashan de rahe hon, aise kisi bhi kaam se pehle raashtragan gane se in kaamon ke prati aapkaa samarpan or ruchi pavitra or sachhee ho jaaegi
 For the 10th time, the pillars of democracy have to come first for everyone but to set its standard
 masalan, sansad bhawan main rose din kii shuruyaat raashtragan se ho
 Every leader, whether he wants to give speeches or abuses, should sing the national anthem first
 har vidhayak mike phenke yaa paperwet, parche uchhaale yaa note, pehle raashtragan gaae
 Collector, SP, DIG, I, Patwari, Tehsildar, Secretary should do the same
 har file sin karne se pehle ek raashtragan to banataa he na ji
 And yes, the national anthem was printed on the front page daily in the media as well
 log us hisse ko katkar apane paas rakhen taaki uskaa apmaan na ho
 Every TV anchor and every radio announcer should sing the national anthem first, then start the bulletin
 bas 52 second kii to baat he
 Note - These are 10 tips
 aap or jab jab jahaan jahaan raashtragan gaanaa chahen, ga sakate hai
 And yes, after every national anthem, if there is a system of sweets, then there will be neither malnutrition nor starvation
 mid-de mile jaisi skiimon kii zarurat bhi khatm ho jaaegi
 The enthusiasm that will come in people will be different

 dilli main teen din tak deraa daal kar tiemasi supremeo or pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne vipakshi ekajutata ke liye tamaam raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon se baat kii
 Mamta's efforts are showing that she is going to be the axis of 2019 'BJP Hatao Mission'
 mamata ne dilli pravaas ke dauraan in atakalon kii bhi hawa nikaal di ki congress ko lekar unke man main ashankaayen hai
 Bypassing the speculation of differences, Mamata went to meet UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday evening
 isse pehle din main unhone bijepi ke baagi netaaon main maane jane vaale arun shouri, yashavanth sinha or shatrughna sinha se mulaakaat kii
 While these three leaders attacked the Modi government sharply, Mamta was very appreciative
 mamata ne dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal se bhi mulaakaat kii
 Also discussed his political plan for 'BJP Hatao Mission'
 ‘10 janpath’ par sonia gandhi se mulaakaat ke baad baahar nikalate hue patrakaron se baatcheet main mamata ne sonia ke saath apane achche samikarnon kaa zikr kiya
 Mamta said, 'whenever i come to Delhi, i meet Sonia Gandhi, i got information about her health which is better
 maine unke saath raajnneetik vimarsh bhi kiya
 Mamta was also present with TMC MP Derek o'brien during the meeting with Sonia
 mamata ne congress samet sabhi bijepi virdohi partiyon ko ekajute hone kaa aahvaan karte hue kaha, ‘desh chahta he ki 2019 main ‘van tu van’ muqabla ho
 Everywhere, the party which is the strongest must contest the election
 ham chaahate hai ki congress kshetreey dalon kii madad kare jisase ki majboot anti-bijepi morcha khadaa kiya ja sake
 
 
 a united fight will politically overthrow the BJP
 ’bataa den kimamta banerjeene 13 march ko sonia gandhi kii ore se upie main shaamil dalon ke liye die dinar se dur rahanaa hi behatar samajha tha
 Instead, he sent one of his representatives
 sutron ke mutabik mamata congress se isliye naakhush thim kyonki tripura main chunaav ladane ke liye congress ne tiemasi se haath nahin milaayaa tha
 According to reports, the distance between Congress and Mamta also increased because Mamata is trying to create a non-bjp-non-congress 'federal Front' by joining regional parties
 haalanki 28 march ko mamata or sonia gandhi kii mulaakaat ne modi virdohi morcha banane kii sambhaavna ko bal diya he jisamen congress samet sabhi vipakshi dal shaamil rahen
 At the same time, Mamata has emerged as a motivator of opposition solidarity with this development
 mamata ne kaha, ‘main chaahati hum ki karnataka main congress jite kyonki vahaan congress majboot he
 In UP, we want akhilesh-mayawati to win, similarly Lalu Yadav should win in Bihar
 agar van tu van fite hoti he to bijepi kaa janaa tay he
 We are 100 percent confident about this
 ’ dilli pravaas ke dauraan hi mamata ne phone par akhilesh yadav or mayawati se baat kii
 Also thanked Mayawati for supporting the Ram Navami issue
 buudhvaar ko dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal ne bhi mamata se 45 minute tak baat kii
 However, after this meeting he did not talk to the media

 The Shiv Sena continues to criticize the Modi government on various issues
 dilli main mamata kii ahm baithkon main ensipi supremeo sharad pavaar se bhi mulaakaat karnaa rahaa
 Both leaders advocated regional parties coming on a platform before the 2019 elections
 fedral front banane kii koshishon ke bich sabase ahm sawaal ye he ki is morche kaa captain koun hoga
 Right now there is a round of speculation about it
 har kshetreey dal kii koshish he ki uske netaa ko sambhavit morche main zyada se zyada ahmiyat mili
 It is also a fact that if a front is formed in this way, then the members of his team will be at different poles not only from different geographically but also ideologically

 Assembly Election Results LIVE: maharashtra-haryana main shuru hui matganana, aaj nattejey In the house of Bigg Boss, now everyone's real faces are slowly coming out
 gauhar ke khilaaf maahaul bana diya gaya he
 Pyaar Bahu Pratyusha Banerjee and Vamp Kamya Punjabi of tvpur are not able to tolerate Gauhar at all
 kamya is reality sho main bhi apane tivi vaale vaimp avatar main najar aa rahi hai
 With every day, the temperature and spectacle of Bigg Boss house is increasing and this is the reason that now tu-tu main-i has started among the members of the house
 pehle khaane ko lekar jang hui thi or ab sambandhon ko lekar bhi jamkar takaraar ho gai
 Pratyusha Banerjee and Ratan Rajput clashed when both were talking about their earlier relationship

 Pratyusha said that before raising fingers on others, he should see for himself as his relationship has also failed

 Now you call it the custom of Bigg Boss house or something, but anyone who seems to be moving forward in this reality show tries to stop it
 shaayad isiilie gauhar ke khilaaf is tarah kaa maahaul banaaya gaya he, anyathaa aisa kuch bhi nahin hua jisase maahaul unke khilaaf is kadar bighad jaae
 Many members of the house voted against Gauhar in voting and eventually he was evicted from heaven and sent to Jahnum

 narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko bharat ke pradhanmantri ke rup main duusari baar shapath lee
 This swearing-in ceremony will be known for a number of reasons as well as a refusal by an ally Janata Dal United to join the cabinet
 shapath grahan samaaroh se thik pehle janata dal united ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne saaf kaha ki ve bhaajapa ke saath hai lekin mantrimandal main sankethik rup se shaamil hone ke aupchaarik nyote ko sweekaar karne ke prastaav par unki party ke logon ne apni sahmati nahin di
 Although on Thursday also BJP national president Amit Shah spoke to Nitish Kumar, but it seems that the proposal for more than one place in his cabinet was not accepted 
 nitish kumaar ke ek cabinet ke pad ke nyote ko na maanane ke peeche kai kaaran hai
 The main reason among them is the resentment of the parliaments in his own party
 lekin isse bhi zyada nitish kumaar us formula se pareshaan hai jisamen bhaajapa koi nirnay lekar sahyogiyon par thopane kii niti par chalane lagi he
 If the same formula is repeated especially in Bihar assembly elections in future, then they may have to take it
 isliye mantrimandal main shaamil na hone kaa faisla saarvajanik kar nitish kumaar ne bhaajapa ko saafe-saafe sanket de diya ki unke upar bhaajapa kaa nirnay maanane kii koi baadhyataa nahin he
 They should not be expected that they will do whatever the BJP wants, even if it has got a strong majority in the Lok Sabha elections
 nitish is baat ko lekar khapha dikhe ki akali dal, jiske do sansad hai, use or paswan jinke chah sansad hai, kii party kaa bhi ek-ek cabinet mantri banaaya gaya jabaki unki party jediu ke 16 sansad hai or uske liye bhi itani hi jagah mantrimandal main rakhi gai
 Although it will not have any immediate political impact, but BJP will now see every step of Nitish
 bhaajapa ke logon kaa kahana he ki jaisaa media ke ek varg main turant nae raajnneetik sameekaran banane or bigaadane kaa khel shuru hota he vaisaa kuch nahin hoga kyonki bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar chalaane main jo nitish kumaar ko comfort he vaisaa argedy ke saath bees maheene kii sarkaar main kabhi dekhne ko nahin mila
 Therefore, there is only one message of this whole episode that Nitish will be a partner in the government but on his own terms
 or bihar ke gathbandhan main bhi vahi bos hai isliye koi nirnay lekar bhaajapa yah ummid nahin kar sakati ki ve maan jaaenge

 agar mujhe ye kariyar jari rakhana he,to apana tarika ijad karnaa hoga
 Then the next question arose, how

 Love with Madhubala: Did i love Madhubala, as the newspapers and magazines of the time reported frequently
 haa, main unki taraf aakarshith tha
 She was undoubtedly a very good actress
 unamem ek aurat ke taur par bhi aisi bahut si khubiyaan thim, jo meri us vakt kii chaah ke kareeb thim
 There was a strange feeling in his personality
 unheen kii vajah se main apane sharmilepan se baahar aayaa

 Our Punjabi and her Bengali: i remember an anecdote of an outdoor shooting of a Madhumati film

 On any given day the real fun started after packup
 main or praan punjabi main baat karte to bimal or rishi da bengali main batiyaane lagate
 Stories and shayari also ran in between
 udhar khansama hamaare liye umdaa pakwaan banane main mashgool rahata
 I'd like to give shingles to Pran Saheb
 shooting ke baad kii ye yaari kaam ke dauraan unke chehre se nadaarad thi
 In the film, he was playing the character of Ugra Narayan, who had a gray shade

 Why i used to do rehearsals: When Devika Rani gave many actors, including me, a job in Bombay Talkies, then along with that, i also got an idea of how important it is to rehearsal
 unke mutabik ek nunatam level kaa parfections hasil karne ke liye aisa karnaa behad jaruri he
 Then this learning did not stay with me till the early years
 bahut baad tak main maansik taiyaari ke saath hi set par shot ke liye jaataa tha

 Sister rebuked my Berber: My Berber always had problems with my hair

 hajjam bal kaatane ke liye ghar aayaa
 i was shooting somewhere
 maine usase kah rakhaa tha ki agar ghar par na miluun, to intjaar karnaa
 When i came back, i saw a different view

 This was so exasperating to my elder sister that she started to scold her
 maine fouran apane hajjam se iske liye maafee maangi
 Later, i had a clash with Sakina Apa about this

 But here a very beautiful woman was standing
 vah hakeekat main meri soch se bhi zyada khubasurat najar aa rahi thim

 Recently, he also met Congress President Rahul Gandhi, after which the two leaders announced that he would jointly contest against the BJP
 ek tikaakar kaa kahana he ki ''1993 main america sarkaar pakistan ko aatankwaad kaa samarthan karne vaala desh ghoshit karne ke ekadam kagaar par pahunch gai thi
 Since then, the threat of that threat and the threat of its new form 'terrorist country' has always been hanging on its head
 is avadhi main pakistan aisi beshumaar aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main pratyaksh taur par shaamil rahaa he jisamen americanyon kii maut hui
 Along with this, Europeans, Afghans and many Indians were also killed
 iske baavjood america kii shabdaawalee main pakistan 'pramukh gaiyr-nato sahyogi' bana hua he or use udaartaa se sainya sahaayta or vikaas ke liye madad milti rahi he
 However, after several consecutive attempts in the US Congress, there has been some restriction on the flow of funds (pakistan has received $ 33 billion since 2002) as a help
 2016 tak yah madad maamuli-si rah gai thi (1 arab dollar se thodi si zyada) kyonki america raksha vibhaag ne yah pramanit karne se inkaar kar diya ki pakistan ne hakkaani network par roak lagane kii disha main paryaapt kadam uthaae hai
 It is also worth considering in the US Congress that Pakistan should be banned and declared a terrorist country
 mahatvapurn baat yah bhi he ki raashtrapati donald trump or unke prashasan ke kai varisht sadsy 'vinaash ke agenton' ko madad dene vaali pakistan kii domunhi niti ko lekar islamabad ke prati apni aalochanaon or chetavaniyon main kaaphi mukhar ho gaye hai
 It is also important that the perceptions of Washington and New Delhi coincide during the United Nations General Assembly
 jahaan bhartiya videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne pakistan ko jihadiyon kii uniwarsity or techristaan kahkar sambodhit kiya to trump ne 'nirdosho kaa katleam karne vaale al-kaayda jaise aatanki sanghathanon ke madadgaar deshon ko benakaab karne or unhen jimmedaar tehraane' kii dhamkee di
 However, there are several factors that prevent Pakistan from being declared a terrorist country
 sabase mahatvapurn he afghanistan main sajhi senaaon ko pakistan ke jariye aapurti banaae rakhane kaa america hit (haalanki yah nirbharta bhi ab kam ho rahi he)
 Apart from this, there is also the fear that after any such declaration, this nuclear-powered country may either be uncontrollable or the condition of the power institutions there may be so weak that the weapons of massacre may fall into the hands of Islamic terrorist groups

 reliance jeeyo ne naa sirf sim card launch kiya tha, balki saath hi kai ap package bhi pesh kiye the jo shuruyaat main kaaphi popular hue
 It became so popular that Google Play Store and App Store went up from Facebook and whatsapp for some time in the category of free downloadable apps
 5 sitambar ke kuch din baad ye top eps ban gaye
 The reason for this was that initially, users were required to install 12 apps of Reliance Jio to activate Jio
 aisa na karne par acteveshan or colling main dikkat hoti thi
 However, this is not the case now and without installing the app, the activation processor is being done
 or shaayad yahi vajah he ki ab eps kii lokapriyata bhi lagaataar kam ho rahi he
 The popularity of the My Jio app is also decreasing on the App Store and now the app has come in third place in the most downloaded app
 iske alaava jeeyo kaa ek or khaas ap jeeyo cinema bhi kaaphi popular hua tha, lekin ab taaja ranking ke mutabik pichley hafte google play or ap store se top 10 ap se baahar ho gaya
 However, it has come back to number 9 again this Monday
 iconomik times kii telecom website ke mutabik jeeyo tivi ap google play store par pehle chauthe number par tha or paanchave par aa gaya he
 But it has also dropped out of the top-10 from the App Store last week
 in sab ke alaava geonnet, jeeyo jwine, jeeyo beats or jeeyo mags bhi popular eps kii katigari se google map or ap store donon se hi baahar ja chuke hai
 Currently jio4gvoice was at number 10 on the Play Store last week which has now come up and is at number three
 gauratlab he ki philhal jeeyo ke sabhi eps ke liye sabsakriplens free hai
 That is, people are losing interest even after the services are free
 free sabsakripshan khtam hone ke baad in eps ko istemaal karne ke liye paise dene honge
 So, in such a situation how successful these apps will be for Reliance Jio, it cannot be said
 yugers ke mutabik maujuuda daur main jeeyo ke eps kaaphi ruuk ruuk kar chalate hai or hang bhi ho jate hai

 cricket ke kisi bhi formet main team kii safalataa uske khilaadiyon ke fitness or form par nirbhar karata he
 When the ICC World Cup, the biggest cricket tournament, is in front, teams are trying to improve themselves
 viraat kohli ke netritv main world cap ke liye ravaanaa hone vaali team india bhi cricket ke is mahaasangram ke liye qamar kas chuki he
 But the question is whether Team India is fit and if yes, how fit are our players compared to other players of the world? To test fitness, a test is taken in the cricket world, which is called the yo-yo Test
 is test main jiskaa score jitna zyada hota he use utana zyada feet mana jaataa he
 Talk about Team India, captain Virat Kohli is considered the most fit player of the team, but he is also far behind many players in the world, rather than many teams
 pakistan cricket team ke coach gran luden ne haal hi main isisi se baatcheet main kaha ki pakistani khilaadiyon ne yo-yo test main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Team India has been left behind in terms of fitness
 yah yakeen karnaa mushkil he ki team india ke sabase feet khilaadi kohli se bhi feet cricketer world cap main khilne ke liye utrenge
 These include many players from Pakistan as well
 pakistan cricket team ke 26 varshiya khilaadi mohammad rigwan ne yo-yo test main 21 kaa score praapt kiya he
 At the same time, 24-year-old fast bowler Hasan Ali has a score of 20 in the yo-yo Test
 vahiin, vanade cricket main duniya ke number ek ballebaaj or team india ke captain viraat kohli kaa yo-yo test kaa score 19 he
 Kohli is considered the most fit player in the team
 bataa den ki bharat kii senior or e team ke liye yo-yo test ko paas karne ke liye maujuuda maanak 16
 1 is jabaki, pakistan kii team ke liye yo-yo test ko paas karne kaa maanak 17:4 he
 India is the least in the world? Australia and New Zealand have to score the most points in terms of yo-yo test, because there are 20 for this test
 1 ank laana anivaary he
 Australia is followed by the West Indies and England team in terms of yo-yo test scores, whose players have to touch 19 points in Tests
 iske baad dakshin africa ke khilaadiyon ko 18 ank, srilanka ke khilaadiyon ko 17
 4 points, Pakistan players 17
 4 ank or bhartiya khilaadiyon ko 16
 It is compulsory to score 1
 aakhir kya he yo-yo test
 
 ?ab jaraa 'yo-yo' pareekshan ko bhi samaj len
 With the help of several 'cones' two lines are made at a distance of 20 meters
 ek khilaadi rekha ke peeche apana paanv rakhkar shuruyaat karata he or nirdesh milte hi daudna shuru karata he
 The player runs between two consecutive lines and has to turn when the beep rings
 har ek minute yaa isi tarah se teji badhati jaati he
 If the line is not reached on time, then two more 'beeps' have to catch pace
 agar khilaadi do chhoron par teji hasil nahin kar paata he to pareekshan roak diya jaataa he
 The entire process is based on software, in which the results are recorded

 utsaah or utsukata se bhare in yuvaaon ke man main na sirf kareeb se obama ko dekhne kii chaah thi, balki duniya ke sabase taqatvar desh ke raashtrapati ko sunne-samajhane kii lalak bhi
 Obama came, gave a speech and his speech was largely addressed to the same youth, who constitute the largest part of India's population
 unhone na sirf bharat ke chaatro ke america jaakar padhane kii baat kii, balki america chaatro ke bhi bharat main padhane kii baat kahi
 Talked about protecting women
 yah bhi kaha ki jis desh kii naariyaan safal hoti hai, vahi desh bhi safal hota he
 When the students came out after hearing this speech, they were confused about two things - one, they did not get a chance to ask any questions, because most of them hoped that they would also get a chance to ask Obama questions
 thik vaise hi, jaise 7 november, 2010 ko mumbai ke saint xaviers college ke chaatro ko mila tha
 Someone had to ask what he can do for scholarship, then how can he manage time for his family while handling such a big country
 koi yah jaananaa chahta tha ki america-china rishton main bharat kahaan feet hota he, to kisi ko pakistan policy par jawaab chahie tha
 Well, this time it could not be done, but everyone was happy to see and hear Obama in front and compare his speech to Narendra Modi
 haa, peeche kii panktiyon main baithe chaatro ko ek or dukh zarur tha - obama ke saath selfi nahin le paae! UP Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma arrived in Gujarat to invite the Kumbh to be held in Prayagraj
 unhone mukhyamantri vijay roopaani ko apni puri cabinet or wibrant gujarat main aane vaale mehmaanon ke saath prayagraj main hone vaale kumbh main hissaa lene kaa nyauta diya
 Dinesh Sharma also appealed to Rahul to come to Kumbh

 i invite Rahul Gandhi to come to Kumbh
 isi bahaane rahul apane dada firoz jahangir khan kii kabr par bhi gum lenge
 This tomb is in Prayagraj itself, where Rahul has not yet visited
 main unhen kahana chahta hum ki wo aaen, apane dadaji kii kabr par mombatti jalaaen taaki unki aatma ko shanti mili
 Along with Dinesh Sharma, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani also hit back at Rahul Gandhi over Rafale, saying that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi used to say that if he sends one rupee from Delhi, the village reaches fifteen paise
 rahul kaa bhrashtachar par bolne kaa koi naitik aadhikaar nahin he
 Let me tell you, the Uttar Pradesh government is organizing this Kumbh in Prayagraj in a grand way

 The judges praised the performance of both of them, though Ali left his x girlfriend in front of everyone to leave the show like this

 Regarding Natasha, Ali said, 'natasha is not rude at all
 bas log use galat samaj lete hai kyonki wo hindi main dhang se apni baat nahin rakh paati or wo khud ko zyada express nahin kar paati
 'ali further said,' My heart burns when he is suffering

 punjab neshnal bank ghotaale main mukhya aaropee diamond kaarobaari neerav modi ke thikaanon par sibiai or idi kii chhapemari jari he
 Meanwhile, on Monday, Nirav Modi has written a letter to PNB saying that he can no longer repay the bank's money, his company has suffered due to the continuous action
 isliye ab vah paise chukaane main sakasham nahin he
 The letter written by Nirav Modi to PNB has come out, read the big things of the letter
 
 
 neerav modi ne pienbi ko likhaa ki bank or mere afasaron ke bich hui baatcheet or 13 farvari-15 farvari ko likhe hue aapke mail ke aadhaar par main aapse kuch baat karnaa chahta hum
 Constant actions are being taken against us from the bank
 lekin bainkon kii taraf se or media main jo 11000 karod kii raashi bataai ja rahi he, vah kaaphi zyada he
 Nirav Modi Group has taken a loan for less money
 mere khilaaf shikaayat darj hone ke baad bhi maine aapse likhakar kaha tha ki mujhe firestar group ke kuch share bechney kii ijaajat di jaae, iske alaava bhi isse judin 3 companiyon ke share beche jaaen
 All these are worth about 6500 crores rupees, which would help repay the bank's amount
 neerav modi ne likhaa ki pienbi ke dwaara kii gai shikaayat ke baad kii gai karrwai or media kawarej se fire international privet limited (FIPL) company ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaa he
 Which can make it very difficult for us to pay the dues of banks
 neerav ne likhaa kibank kii tarafase pichley kai varshon main teen companiyon par byrs credit ko badhaayaa gaya he
 During this time, there is no disturbance in any company
 jo bhi paisa pienbi se lone ke taur par liya gaya tha, uskaa istemaal videshi shakhaon main advance pement karne ke liye kiya gaya he
 FIPL and FPIPL have been in profit for the past several years and have also got an A-ranking
 neerav ne likhaa ki jaisaa ki bank jaanata he ki PNB ne khud pichley kai saal se hamen die gaye paison par byaaj lene kaa laabh uthaaya he, or unhen byaaj samet pienbi kii sari raashi chukaai bhi gai he
 The property which is being raided continuously and according to the media reports, about 5649 crore rupees are being seized
 agar ye karrwai naa hui hoti to in sampatti or anya kuch sampattiyon ko milakar bank kaa sara paisa lautaaya ja saktaa tha
 But after this action, it has become difficult to do this
 PNB mahaghotaalaa: 3 aropiyon ko remand, neerav faraar, kaise vasuul honge 11400 karod?main sabhi se apil karata hum ki is karrwai ko paardarshita, nyaay or sahi banking system ke saath kiya jaae
 So that i can return all the money to the bank
 neerav modi ne apane khat main apni patni, bhai or mamaa kaa bhi bachaav kiya
 Nirav Modi wrote that all the allegations made against my wife, brother and uncle in the complaint are wrong
 meri patni or mere bhai kaa mere bijness main koi role nahin he, vahiin mere mamaa kaa bijness mujhase bilkul alag he
 So it is wrong to associate his name with me

 Uddhav said, the central government should decide to build Ram temple and soon Ram temple should be built

 He said that if the need arises, we will start the temple movement again

 jab loksabhaa chunaav se pehle uddhav thakare pehali baar ayodhya pahunche the, tab kaha tha ki ram hamaare liye raajnneeti kaa vishay nahin hai
 Shiv Sena will never ask for votes in Ram's name

 This panel will examine whether a consensus can be reached between the parties involved in the dispute

 They said that if they did not entertain for four days, then they expelled me from the house
 ghar ke sadasyon or khaskar paras ko is baat par puraa confidence tha ki shahanaz ghar se baahar nahin jaaengi

 Two new plans of Rs 199 and Rs 351
 Reliance Jio ne jiofiber ke liye ek nayaa plan launch kiya he
 After this plan, now the initial price of Jio Fiber FTTH plan will be Rs 351
 chunki jaisi ummid thi ki jiofiber desh bhar main Jio sim kii tarah hi dhooma machaa degaa, lekin aisa nahin hua
 jiofiber plans are more expensive than other broadband companies, and this is probably the reason why jiofiber has not been able to get the same speed as Jio SIM

 After GST, a plan of Rs 351 will be available for Rs 414
 isse pehle tak jiofiber kaa plan 699 rupee se shuru hota tha

 The Supreme Court turned down the plea of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister j Jayalalithaa to dismiss the case filed for amassing vast wealth
 is maamle main karnataka main sunwaayee shuru hone vaali he
 a bench of judges b Sudarshan Reddy and SS Nijjar rejected the appeal of AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa
 apil main kaha gaya tha ki karnataka ucch nyaayalay ne nichali adaalat ke is aadesh ko maanakar galati kii he jisamen kaha gaya he ki paanch june 1997 ko darj kii gayi shikaayat kaa sangyaan lene main koi aniyamitata yaa gaiyr kanoonee baat nahin he
 The apex court had on March 19 refused to grant a stay on the hearing of the 14-year-old case and also directed the lower court to give a time limit for cross-examination of 42 witnesses in the case after giving full time to Jayalalithaa
 
 annadramuk pramukh jayalalita ne karnataka ucch nyaayalay ke das march ko die gaye faisle ko chunauti dete hue sheersh adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 In the year 2003, the apex court transferred the case to the High Court
 yah kadam dramuk netaa ke anabajhagan kii yachika par uthaaya gaya tha or us samay jayalalita mukhyamantri thim
 The DMK leader said in the petition that the manner in which the trial court of Chennai has taken up the case raises doubts on fair and independent hearing of the case
 ucch nyaayalay ke das march ke aadesh par jayalalita ne apni yachika main kaha tha ki aaropapatr main unke khilaaf koi maamla nahin bana he
 The petition said that the special judge of the Chennai court did not set his mind and took cognizance of the chargesheet filed on 5 June 1997 in a mechanized manner
 isamen yah bhi aarope lagaaya gaya ki tamilnadu main unke raajnneetik pratidwandviyon ke ishaare par maamle ko sthanantarit kiya gaya

 His petition stated that the High Court did not address some of the issues raised by him and hence the order is not law-abiding
 ucch nyaayalay ne chennai kii nichali adaalat ke 1997 main jari aadesh ko radd karne kii jayalalita kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha
 The trial court had taken cognizance of the complaint by the Tamil Nadu Vigilance and anti-corruption Directorate stating that Jayalalithaa acquired more assets from her known sources during this period
 ucch nyaayalay ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki ‘‘prakhyat vakeelon ne kushalta ke saath’’ jayalalita kaa cese pesh kiya or unhone maamle kii sunwaayee main bhaag liya jiske dauraan 13 saalon se adhik samay main 200 gavaahon se jirah kii gayi
 The court said in its order, "now Jayalalitha has no option to demand cancellation of the proceedings on the grounds that the order issued on June 5, 1997 taking cognizance of the offense is not law

 From the historic Phul Bagh Maidan in Kanpur, bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Lalkar Modi will be found
 kanpur prashasan ke dhulmul ravaiye ko dekhte hue bijepi ne hi raily ke liye duusare maidan kii anumati maangi he
 On 26 September 2013, the Kanpur BJP Committee wrote a letter to the Kanpur administration
 usamen narendra modi ke raily ke liye aitihaasik phulbaag maidan kii maang kii thi
 The Kanpur administration had given orally permission to BJP to hold a rally at Phulbagh Maidan, but permission was not given until October 4 in writing
 kanpur prashasan ke dhulmul ravaiye ko dekhte hue bijepi kii chintaa badhati ja rahi thi
 In such a situation, Narendra Modi's special Amit Shah asked Kanpur city president Surendra Maithani to change the field and its full details
 nagar adhyaksh surendra maithani ne narendra modi ke raily ke liye kanpur indra nagar ilaake main maujuud buddha park ke saamne bane maidan kaa naam sujhaayaa
 According to Surendra Maithani, the capacity of Phulbagh Maidan is just one lakh twenty thousand people, while Modi's rally is expected to gather more than 4 lakh crowd
 aise main is maidan ko ab raily ke liye cancil kar diya gaya he
 The ground in front of Buddha Park in Indra Nagar area of kanpur has been selected for the rally
 bijepi ne is maidan main narendra modi ke raily karwaae jane ke liye anumati-patr kanpur ke dm samir verma ko de diya he
 Phul Bagh Maidan is also connected with Phul Bagh Maidan
 shahar ke uttar main sthit phulbaag maidan main kanpur kaa puraa itihaas samaaya hua he
 There have also been many successful politicians who started the political journey from this ground
 indira gandhi bhi is maidan se bhaashan de chuki hai
 Phulbagh Maidan is also a favorite of Lal Krishna Advani of BJP
 kehete hai jab bijepi ke atal bihari vaajapeyi ji ne is maidan se hunkaar bhari thi tab rasta jam ho gaya tha
 It was decided that there would not be any political rally, because of the rally in the city, any kind of rally was banned in Phulbagh Maidan
 iskaa samarthan sabhi party ke netaaon ne sarvasammati se sweekaar bhi kiya gaya tha
 But suddenly due to the stubbornness of the BJP, the Kanpur administration was in a state of confusion
 kanpur ke dm ne 2 aktubar ko bijepi kii netaaon ke saath baithak main ye saaf kar diya tha ki agar bijepi ko raily ke liye maidan diya jaataa he to phir har party ko dena padega
 Nevertheless, the Kanpur administration had sought details from the Kanpur SSP in view of the municipality and security overseeing the grounds
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki jab prashasan ko is maidan kii kshamta pataa thi or modi ke raily main jutane vaali bheed kii bhi jaankaree thi to phir maidan ko anumati ke kyon latakaae rakhaa
 When there is a ban on the holding of any rally at Phulbagh Maidan, then why did the Kanpur administration not directly refuse the BJP
