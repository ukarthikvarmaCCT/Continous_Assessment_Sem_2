 desh main dimonetigeshan kii prakriya ke kendra main bank (sarkari or privet) hai
 It is the responsibility of banks to play an important role after the old currency of 500 and 1000 rupees is declared illegal
 puraani karency ko nagarikon se waapas lekar uske badale main nai karency dene kaa kaam bina ruke lagaataar chalata rahe
 Also, all banks (government and private) of the country should prepare all their branches to do this work
 lekin kya aapkaa bank is jimmedaari ke liye taiyaar he? kya uske paas vah tamaam suvidhaayen uplabdh hai jisase vah is kaam ko bakhubi anjaam de sake?rigerv bank of india desh kaa central bank he
 Bank of banks or say government bank
 nai karency kii printing kaa kaam rigerv bank ke jimme rahata he
 Currently, printing of Rs 2000, 500 rupees and 100 rupee currencies is going on non-stop
 arabiai ke printing press main inakrency kii chapaika kaam puraa hote hi inhen desh ke tamaam bainkon ko bhej diya jaataa he
 The big private bank gets a new currency as soon as it reaches the new currency, the bank makes it available to its branch and then directly to its customer
 is sanchaar ke liye rigerv bank shiduld bainkon kii list taiyaar karata he
 Usually all government banks are included in this list and big private banks are also kept with them
 lihaaja, karency ko lekar jari sankat main jaaniye ki kya aapkaa bank rigerv bank kii is praathamikta vaali shiduld list main aata he
 Banks included in this list are equipped with currency chests
 yah karency chest badi maatra main karency ko surakshit rakhane kii kshamta hoti he
 All the branches of the said bank carry out cash transactions through currency chests for their day-to-day needs
 yah bhi rigerv bank ne tay kiya he ki bank kii kisi branch main cash rakhane kii kitni limit honi chahie or is limit ke paar hone par use atirikt cash najdiki karency chest main jamaa karana hota he
 Along with changing the need for refills many times, banks need to start their ATM network spread across the country with new currency with immediate effect
 atm or bank par umad rahi bheed ko kam karne kaa sirf ek hi tarika he ki bank ke alaava desh ke sabhi atm kii riphiling kaa kaam bina ruke chalata rahe
 Refill atms in crowded areas several times a day, if needed
 vahiin jin bainkon ko is list main nahin shaamil kiya gaya he unke paas kisi tarah kaa koi karency chest nahin rahata he
 Hence to follow the instructions of the Reserve Bank, they have to deposit their surplus cash in the currency chest of another bank on rent
 maujuuda sthiti main jab shiduld bank apni branch or atm kii vyavastha ko durust karne kii kavayad main lage hai, non shiduld bainkon kii jarurat unki praathamikta main nahin hai
 Now check this list under these rules of the Reserve Bank, whether your own bank is included in the list of scheduled bank
 kya aapke bank kii kisi branch ke paas karency chest maujuud he jisase atm or branch main karency kii supplai lagaataar banaae rakhane main madad mili

 modi ne shaikh hasina ko unke drushtikon ke liye badhai di
 After this comment by Modi, there was a lot of criticism on Twitter
 logon ne unki tippanee ko 'pakshpatpurna' bataaya
 Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha wrote on Twitter, 'at the core of the RSS / BJP is hatred, bigotry, extremism and partiality of women
 narendra modi iskaa ek or udhaaharan hai

 Why such negative thinking? '- Input from IANS a post shared by Bollywood Current Insta (@bollywoodcurrent_insta) on Mar 28, 2018 at 5:49am PDT The secret of 11 deaths in Burari, Delhi, is still pending
 har roj nae-nae khulaase hone ke baavjood vaastavik vajah pataa nahin chal paa rahi he
 Police are also awaiting the final post-mortem report
 iske baad bhi maut kii sahi vajah saamne aa paaegi
 11 days have passed since this incident, but people are still waiting for the answers to these 11 questions
 1- abhi tak postmortem report puri nahin ai he
 So suspense remains intact on the exact cause of death
 2- abhi tak yah bhi saaf nahin ho paaya he ki register koun likhata tha? priyanka yaa lalit? handriting export isamen madad kar sakate hai
 3- Were all people ready to commit suicide at Lalit's behest? Suspense remains intact on this as well
 4- aakhir itane saare logon main se kisi ne bhi samuhik khudakushi kaa virodh kyon nahin kiya?5- priyanka kii haal hi main sagaai hui thi, to aise main yah kaise sambhav he ki vah aatmahatya ke liye taiyaar ho jaae?6- aakhir sabhi log sirf lalit kii baat hi kyon maan rahe the?7- police ne kaha tha ki narayani devi kii hatya hui he
 a case was registered under this
 lekin abhi bhi is par sanshay he
 8- Did two three people prepare all the people for this
 iskaa bhi saboot abhi kisi ke paas maujuud nahin he
 9- Why was the door open on the day of the incident? 10- Did these people remove their stools themselves or was someone else removed the stool? 11- Was it an accidental accident? It was after the father's death This whole case started in a very dramatic way
 pita kii maut ke baad dukaan par lalit kaa jhagada hua tha
 The attackers locked it inside the shop and set it on fire from outside
 lalit kii jaan to batch gai lekin dehshat main uski aawaaj chali gai thi
 Lalit and family were completely broken by this incident
 kai saal tak lalit kii aawaaj nahin lauti thi
 According to a register, Lalit used to tell the family members that he talks to the father's soul
 sutron kaa kahana he ki lalit ke sapane main ek din pita aae or kaha ki wo chintaa na kare, jaldi hi uski aawaaj laut aegi
 He wrote and shared this dream with the family as soon as he woke up in the morning
 phir aae din sapane main lalit ko apane pita dikhaai dene lage
 Manglik's sister was fixed, but after few days Lalit's unwavering faith started when his voice improved
 iske baad to lalit aksar pita kii aatma se milane karne kii karne laga
 Whatever he said, the family would have obeyed his father's orders
 ittfa dekhiye
 Lalit's sister Manglik Priyanka's wedding was getting hampered
 puja-paath ke baad uski shaadi tay ho gai
 The family started believing Lalit, not the family, first the Bhatia family had three shops
 puraa parivaar iskaa shrey pita ke bataae raste ko detaa tha or lalit iskaa madhyam tha
 So the family members respected Lalit like a father
 us roj jo prakriya apanaai ja rahi thi, uske peeche makasad parivaar ko mili khushiyon ke liye ishwar kaa dhanyavad gyaapan karnaa tha

 varun ko kattar hinduvadi netaa ke rup main janaa jaataa he or is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki unke aane ke baad is seat par muqabla sidhe taur par hindu banaam musalmaan kaa hoga
 "BJP sources reveal that while preparations are on to fight Varun from here, on the other hand two local level domineering and criminal image leaders - Chandrabhadra Singh alias Sonu and Yashbhadra Singh alias Monu - also joined the BJP
 Preparations for the conduct are almost complete
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main sonu-monu ne pis party ke binar tale chunaav ladaa tha
 BJP strategists point out that sonu-monu had not been successful in winning the election, but had won a fair amount of votes
 sonu ne sultanpur vidhansabha kshetra se kareeb 35 hajaar vot hasil kiye the, jabaki monu ne ishauli vidhansabha kshetra se kareeb 32 hajaar vot hasil kiye the
 According to sources, the rationale behind the inclusion of sonu-monu in the BJP is that this will lead to Kshatriya voters' involvement with Varun and at least in both these assemblies will benefit Varun
 sonu-monu ne sabase pehle sapa se chunaav ladaa tha
 Later he moved to BSP
 mayawati ne vidhansabha main tikat nahin diya to unhone pis party kaa daaman tham liya
 Sources say that Rajnath himself is interested in bringing sonu-monu to BJP
 vah in donon ko pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan hi party main shaamil karaane vaale the, lekin kushvaha prakaran kii vajah se aisa nahin ho sakaa
 At the same time, a senior BJP leader said that the inclusion of sonu-monu in the BJP could have far-reaching consequences, as the image of the two leaders with criminal records is not good among the general public
 yadi daanv ulta pad gaya to varun kii ummiido par pani phir saktaa he
 Regarding the landing of Varun in Sultanpur, BJP state spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said, "A rally is held in Sultanpur on May 16, in which party general secretary Varun Gandhi and former national president Nitin Gadkari will be present
 party kii sansadeey samiti tay karegi ki kise kahaan se chunaav ladanaa he
 At the same time, he denied the information related to sonu-monu being included in the party

 1
 sarkaatpani soch ko lekar spasht nahin he
 The government has good ideas, but it is lagging behind in implementing them
 samaj or vaayadon tathaa projection or parformens main bada gap he
 The government should remain completely low profile
 2

 7
 bharat ko majdoor vyavastha ko lekar sudhaar karne kii jarurat he

 The opposition has united against Modi
 8

 samaj nahin aata ki in padon ko bharaa kyon nahin gaya
 Due to this important organizations are facing trouble
 9
 The government should remove the fear of minorities
 sarkaar alpsankhyakon ko bharosa dilaane main naakaam rahi he
 Christians are very angry

 Modi must speak on these complex issues
 unki chuppi se naitik sawaal khadey hote hai

 Vidiya (naipaul) has been brought to the emergency ward and within hours she came to know that she has an infection in her lungs, so she was admitted to the hospital
 ham dilli se lahore pahunche hi the ki mujhe hospital aana padaa jiske daravaaje par saikadon marijon or mulakatiyon kaa tantaa laga hua he
 Even after spending 11 days in the hospital, i was not relieved, because those days seem pleasant compared to what happened later

 Then my son's chef appeared with folded hands and said, "shah Sahib, the gas is over

 Even now the news was colored by incidents of separatist killings, mutilation, kidnapping and sabotage

 Every night there was a party in his house and the flow of liquor flowed
 usne mujhase poocha, “aakhir mujhe kab tak kismat kii maar jhelni padegi?” usne ek pakistani khumaini ke liye dua maangi, jo aam aadmi ko bachaa sake
 "bibi, us" and in this 'us', he includes the army of the butlers and all the servants standing next to him, saying, "there is a Khomeini to end this oppression!" i did not get angry with him
 maine usase kaha ki jawaab khumaini nahin he
 Yes, Khomeini will be wiped out, but there is no guarantee that his siblings, sons, even he himself will not come under his JD
 uskaa jawaab tha, ‘vah bhale hi mere bhai, bete yahaan tak ki mujhe bhi maar daale, par yah julm to khatm ho jayega!’uski ichha maano bhavishyavaanee thi
 In the same week, not only me, but also among the loyal servants of those old feudal houses showed great enthusiasm

 He said, "bibi, come, check it out

 Hardik is currently in Surat jail
 tippaniyan The need for an audio test came because the crime branch claimed that the sound of Hardik's phone was found to show that he was engaged in activities that amounted to treason and waging war against the government

 ' There is an electoral atmosphere in Pakistan at the moment and political enthusiasts are at their peak, but in the meantime, cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan remains in the headlines
 isaki ek vajah he unki purv patni reham khan
 Reham has claimed that Imran Khan is gay
 imran khan kii patni rahinreham khanki aatmakatha aane vaali he, jisamen unhone apane is purv cricketer pati ke bare main kaaphi baaten kahi hai
 According to Rehm, his book is yet to be printed, but from now on, his autobiography has caused political turbulence in Pakistan
 pakistan kii raajnneeti menimran khaanne apni khaas pahchaan bana lee he, lekin vah kisi na kisi masale par apane desh main charchaa yaa vivaadon main rahete hai
 However, apart from these controversies, Imran's party is busy in PTI elections
 vah khud desh ke pradhanmantri kii res main hai or party unako is pad par dekhnaa chaahati he
 In a conservative Islamic country, Imran is under pressure from his ex-wife for being gay, but he wants to show himself devoted to the country
 imran or reham ke bich vaivaahik sambandh zyada dinon tak nahin chalaa tha or shaadi ke mahaj 10 maheenon main yah shaadi tut gai thi
 Reham's autobiography has become very popular in Pakistan even before coming to the market
 pakistan ke samvidhan kii dhara 62 kahati he ki desh ke har saansad ko 'sadik' or 'amin' hona chahie jiskaa arth hota he 'vishwaas ke yogya' or 'eemaandaar'
 On the basis of this section of the constitution, the opposition wants to surround Imran
 india today ke saath khaas baatcheet main reham khan ne kaha he ki abhi unki kitaab ko bazaar main aana he
 But on the sensational revelation about Imran through the book, he said, 'I want voters to know who they are going to vote for, i have been their witness, have seen their political career very closely and have seen Pakistan Need to know about their reality
 saath hi reham ne yah bhi kaha ki kitaab main unki nijee yatra kii kahani he, jisamen unhone apni nijee jindagi or peshewar jindagi ke bare main vistaar se bataaya he
 When asked about Imran being gay, Rehm said he should wait a little bit about this
 kitaab main vistaar se is bare main bataaya gaya he
 Imran and his party have misused their power
 party main pojishan ke liye sexuel sambandhon kaa sahaara liya gaya
 On the question of Imran claiming that he was addicted to heroin, Reham said that she wants the people of Pakistan to know the habits of the people who are going to vote
 kai logon kii ore se ho rahi aalochana ke bare main reham ne kaha ki kuch log hai jo janhit main sachai ke bare main jaananaa chaahate hai
 The book is yet to come on the market, but Imran will have to tell about the charge whether he is 'sadiq' or 'amen'

 9 disambar 2017, wo taarikh jab maujuuda vakt ke sabase khatarnaak aatanki sanghathan islamic state of iraq and syria ke ant kii tabir likhi gai
 The Prime Minister of Iraq announced the decisiveness of this dread organization from his country
 vahiin, ek samay islamic state kii rajdhani kahalaane vaale syria ke rakka shahar se bhi aies ke ladaakon ko khadeda ja chukaa he or ab yahaan america samarthit syrian kurd or arab ladaakon ne kabza kar liya he
 That is, in 2017, both countries got independence from this organization, which envisions an Islamic state with the names of Iraq and Syria
 haalanki, chaar saal pehle islamic state ke aakaa abu bakar al bagdadi ne jab khilaafat kaa elaan kiya or donon deshon main uske hathiyaarband ladaakon ne khun kaa vahadaaniyat bharaa khel khelaa to uske julmon se duniya kii ruh kaanpane lagi
 The savage IS of the world, who sent humanity to death in the ground, became notorious worldwide
 maasoom bacchon se lekar majaloom auraton tak, sena se lekar patrakaron tak, deshi se lekar videshiyon tak, aies ke aatankiyon ne kisi ko nahin bakhsha
 The time had come that victory over IS was unlikely
 lekin chaar saalon ke sangharsh ke baad akhirkaar iraq ne khud ko 'islamic state' ke khilaaf chal rahi jang ko anjaam tak pahunchaa diya
 Prime Minister Haider Al Abadiene issued a message declaring this independence for Iraq
 apane sandesh main unhone kaha,' mere ajij irakiyon, hamaari jameen ab puri tarah se aaazaad he
 The dream of independence is now a reality
 ' iraq ne yah ghoshnaa roosi sena ke us elaan ke baad kii, jisamen roosi sena ne kaha tha ki syria main aies ko haraane kaa uskaa mishan puraa ho gaya he
 In 2014, the Khilafat was announced by the head of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, in July 2014 issued a statement from the royal mosque of Mosul city in Iraq
 is bayaan main bagdadi ne apni khilaafat kii ghoshnaa kii or kaha ki puri duniya ke musalmaan unhen khalipha maane
 Already, the IS had captured large areas of Syria and Iraq and declared the Khilafat and imposed rule over one crore people
 shuruaati do saalon main aies ke aatankiyon ne jamkar tandav machaaya
 But in the last two years he faced many defeats
 oktober 2016 main iraqi sena ne america sena or duusare sahyogiyon kii madad se aatankiyon ke khilaaf ladaai chhedi
 By the coming of 2017, the dawn of terror began to set in
 amareeki sena, kurd ladaake, syria or roosi sena ne milakar iraq or syria main aatankiyon kaa sarvanaash shuru kar diya
 In July this year, he suffered a defeat in Mosul, Iraq
 vahiin, uski rajdhani maane jane vaale uttari syria ke shahar rakka main bhi uski shikast ho gai
 Mosulmosul is the city in Iraq that Baghdadi used as its capital
 bagdadi pehali baar duniya ke saamne isi shahar se aayaa
 He announced his Khilafat from Mosul Mosque in 2014
 aies ke aatankiyon ne is shahar main jamkar kahar barapaaya
 Thousands died
 lakhon beghar ho gaye
 According to the report of the United Nations Assistance Mission and the United Nations Human Rights High Commission, IS killed at least 741 common people
 vahiin is report main bataaya gaya ki yahaan sainya karrwai main kareeb teen hajaar nagarikon kii maut hui or dedh hajaar ke aasapaas naagarik jakhmi hue
 When the civil war broke out in 2013 in Rakkasiriya, it was captured by rebels against the Assad government
 syria kaa chatha sabase bada shahar, ek vakt main syria kii rajdhani hua karata tha
 But after the rebels took over, the Islamic State occupied it and made it its capital
 saanskrithik taur par syria kii pahchaan maane jane vaale is shahar kii badakismati hi kahi ja sakati he ki unhen aies ke aatankiyon ko bhi jhelana padaa or baad main aatankiyon ke khilaaf utari senaaon ke hamalon se yahaan kii avam jameendoj ho gai
 The Assad government of Syria retaliated with the Russian army to free Raqqa from IS
 seni kii taraf se hawaii hamale bhi kiye gaye, jisamen saikadon masuumon kii jaan gayi
 However, now Russia has declared a cease-fire on the war against terrorists and Raqqa has got independence
 syria se puri tarah out hua aiesanvember 2017 main syrian sena ne islamic state ke kabje vaale aakhri shahar dair-al-jur ko bhi apane kabje main le liya he
 The city was under the occupation of Baghdadi militants right from the arrival of IS
 darasal, ye shahar syria ke liye kaaphi ahm mana jaataa tha
 The area along the river was used for movement of fighters, weapons and goods between Iraq and Syria
 dhah gaye bagdadi ke sabhi kile2017 main bagdadi ke kile kaa sirf ast shuru nahin hua, balki uskaa ek-ek kila lagaataar dhahtaa gaya
 Among them, the Iraqi forces have won back Faluza, Ramadi, Samara, Tikrit, Baiji, Saadia, Jalawla, Mosul, tal-afar, Abu Kamal, Havizah and Anah
 ye iraq ke wo chote-bade shahar hai, jahaan par iesas kaa puri tarah khaatmaa ho chukaa he
 Where is Baghdadi? In the world, this name is now considered to be another name for hardship and terror
 ISIS kaa yah sargana kabhi-kabhi chehre par nakaab pahentaa he
 That is why he is also called 'invisible Sheikh'
 pehali baar vah july 2014 main ek video main dikhaai diya tha
 In which he asked Muslims to consider him as their caliph
 pichley vakt main iraq or syria ke kai ilaakon main aies aatankiyon par hamalon ke dauraan kai baar ye khabaren saamne ain ki bagdadi jameendoj ho gaya

 a feature of democracy is that it is not a solid substance
 loktantr taral padaarth he, isliye aaj kii raajnneeti main propegenda ke dwaara ise thos padaarth main badalane kaa prayaas hota rahata he
 The voting age may be 18 years, but there can be no age for participation in democracy
 kisne sochaa tha ki haryana ke rewadi zile kii 9veen or 10veen kii 80 se adhik ladkiyaan dharne par baith jaaengi or sarkaar se apni maang manavaa lengi
 This is not an ordinary success but also changes our understanding of participation in democracy
 ye dharna sakaaratmak note par samaapt ho chukaa he lekin jab shuru hua to pehle teen chaar dinon tak kisi ne gambhirtha se notice bhi nahin liya
 But as the days passed, the fast of girls of 9th and 10th started to generate curiosity in the media
 apni maang ko lekar tike rahane kii patibaddhta matadaata banane se pehle kii umr main hasil ho jaae, yah thik vaisaa hi he jaise aadmi vayask hone se pehle hi vayask ho jaae
 The maturity of their performance was that the government had to accept their demand
 gothra tappa dahinaa gaanv kaa sarkari hai skool apgrade ho gaya he
 Now after tenth, 11th and 12th will also be studied here
 dasvin ke baad skool na hone se in ladakiyon ko yahaan se teen kimi dur ke skool main janaa padataa
 On the way there had to be victims of molestation to sexual violence
 niyam to yah tha ki 150 chaatro ke rahane par hi kisi skool ko apgrade kiya jaataa tha
 But the number of girls here was only 86
 aise niyam kaa kya phayda jo do chaar das paanch kii sankhya kam hone par baaki logon kii pareshaani ko nazarandaaz kar de
 The police kept saying that the girls had not filed any molestation complaint but the girls remained adamant on their demand
 ab sarkaar ne unki maang maan lee he or mukhyamantri bhi inase milanaa chaahate hai
 Neither politics speaks nor society speaks on the poor condition of government schools across the country, the master is engaged in the work of census to counting and when the result comes, it is known that half the children fail
 internet search se hamen jo jaankaree mili he wo bhi dekh lijie phir se
 In 2016, out of 3 lakh 17 thousand children, 1 lakh 62 thousand failed in the Haryana Board's Class x examination
 kareeb 52 pratishat bachche fail ho gaye
 In 2016, 54 per cent of the children failed in the Bihar board's tenth examination
 2017 main madhya pradesh board kii dasvin pariksha main 52 fisadi bachche fail ho gaye
 Right now the girls of Rewari have demonstrated and achieved success in upgrading the school
 unki is misaal se poocha janaa chahie ki sarkari skulon main lakhon kii sankhya main fail ho rahe bacchon ko lekar abhi tak raajnneeti kyon nahin garmai ki in skulon main aakhir aisa ho kyon rahaa he
 Are government schools a failure factory? jabaki asar jaisi sanstha har saal report nikaalati he ki paanchavi main pahunch kar baccha pehali yaa duusari kii kitaab bhi dhang se nahin pard paata he
 There should be some accountability for this failure
 is saal farvari main asar ne haryana ke schuli chaatro kii jo report di he uske anusaar unke seekhney kii kshamta main giravat hi aa rahi he
 19 of first grade in schools in Haryana
 9 fisadi chaatr sankhya nahin pahchaan pate hai
 24
 4 pratishat chaatr angrezi kaa alphabet nahin pahchaan pate hai
 23
 4 pratishat chaatr hindi varnmaala nahin pard pate hai
 According to the Annual Survey of Education report ASAR, 46 out of the students who have reached class three in Haryana
 2 pratishat chaatr hi duusari kaksha kii kitaaben pard pate hai
 The movement in Rewari says that children must take responsibility for their education on their own
 unhen hi apni padhai kii gunvattta ko lekar andolan karne honge varna saal dar saal unke saath ye ninsaphi hoti rahegi
 You search the Internet, millions of reports will be found on all these problems but nothing concrete and uniform happens
 dikhaane ke liye do chaar skulon ko chun liya jaataa he, unheen ko kaamyaab kahani banaakar bechaa jaataa he
 The comments rewadi ke andolan kaa asar gurugram bhi pahunch gaya
 170 children of Kadarpur village in Gurugram staged a protest in front of the Government High School
 dharna dene waalon main ladakiyon kii sankhya zyaada thi
 They also had the same demand that the school should be done up to 12th class so that they do not have to go to school ten kilometers away from the village after leaving class X
 chaatro ke is pradarshan se sthaneey vidhayak bhi harakat main aa gaye or bacchon ko aashwaasan diya ki garmi kii chhuttiyon ke baad unka skool dasvin se barahavin kaa ho jayega
 Our colleague Saurabh was told by Aarti that his parents would not send him to Badshahpur after tenth, because boys tease on the way
 inkaa kahana he ki gaanv main atm aa gaya he magar barahavin ke liye das kimi dur janaa padataa he
 Nobody gets attention towards government schools
 dhyaan jaataa bhi he to bastaa baantne, cycle baantne jaise masalon ko lekar jaataa he
 Children are kept away from studies in the name of studying here in lakhs
 ve padhane ke naam par saal dar saal bitaa dete hai magar inamen se aadhe bachche fail hone ke liye hi abhishpt hai
 We will talk to the girls of Rewari so that children learn from them and ask your master why you do not teach diligently, why do not you come to teach with preparation, ask your elders why the quality of our education is not in the priority of the governments is
 doosraa rewadi or kadarpur ke pradarshan main khaasbaat he ladakiyon kaa netritv karnaa
 Against whom, against the flirting on the way and against the bigotry of boys

 bihar membijepiur janata dal (you) baraabar siton par chunaav ladenge
 According to the information being received from Jediusutras, agreement has been reached between the two parties
 prastaavit formule ke mutabikloksabhaa chunaavamein jediu or bijepi baraabar siton par jabaki vidhansabha chunaav main jediu bijepi se zyada siton par chunaav ladegi
 There is still some doubt about the number of seats because Upendra Kushwaha's party's stance is not clear yet
 endie ne upendra kushvaha ke saamne 2 siton kaa prastaav rakhaa he jabaki ramvilas paswan kii party ko 4 siten di ja rahi hai
 If all goes well, BJP-JDU will contest 17-17 seats
 agar upendra kushvaha endie chhodte hai to ye sankhya 18-18 bhi ho sakati he
 Just a few days ago, according to a formula, there were talks of giving 16 seats to JDU and 17 to BJP as well as 5 seats to Paswan's party and 2 to Kushwaha
 haalanki jediu ke ek sheersh sutara ne bataaya he ki jab bhi jediu or bijepi ke bich siton kaa bantwaaraa hoga, to barabari par hi hoga
 If it had not been so, the formula for seat sharing would have been fixed
 jaahir he kibiharmen hameshaa bade bhai kii bhoomika nibhaane vaali jediu kisi bhi keemat par bijepi ke saamne apana kad chota nahin karnaa chaahati
 However, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the jdu's stature became very small and the BJP became as big as a mountain in front of it
 par dobaaraa endie main aane kaa baad jediu kii koshish he ki maamla barabari kaa rahe, taaki izzat bachi rahe
 In the last Lok Sabha election, NDA was successful in 31 out of 40 seats of Bihar, in which 22 seats were won by BJP, 6 seats by Lok Janshakti Party and 3 by Rashtriya Loksamata Party
 akele chunaav lard rahi jediu ko mahaj 2 siton par santosh karnaa padaa tha
 In such a situation, JDU contests from 2 seats to 17 or 18 seats, then the BJP will have to lose the maximum five seats
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki agle hafte siton ke talmail kaa elaan kar diya jayega
 Samajwadi Party leaders did not stop the process of losing consciousness

 unhone kaha ki ham nahin chaahate ki pratibandhit noton ke jariye koi samanaantar arthvyavastha chale
 The government has given an opportunity to overseas Indians coming from abroad to exchange the notes which have been taken out of circulation till 30 June
 in noton ko rigerv bank ke vinirdisht (specified) karyaalayon par badla ja sakegaa
 For this, nris have to give full details along with the number to the customs department at the airports about the old banned notes brought with them
 vitt mantralay ne ek bayaan main kaha ki aise pravasi bharatiyon ko rigerv bank kii vinirdisht shakhaon main band kiye gaye note jamaa karaate samay seemaa shulk vibhaag main daakhil byora bhi prastut karnaa hoga, jhootha byora dene par nunatam 50,000 rupye yaa noton ke kul mulya main se jo bhi adhik hoga, utana jurmaana dena hoga
 At the time of demonetisation announcement on 8 November, the government gave 50 days to the public to deposit the banned notes in banks
 yah avadhi puri ho chuki he
 With some conditions, these notes can still be exchanged at the RBI counters by 31 March, but nris have been given an opportunity till 30 June
 is adhyadesh ke tahat jurmaane kaa praavdhaan 31 march 2016 ke baad prabhavi hoga
 For those living in the country on the same day, the period of changing the note will end completely
 bayaan main kaha gaya he ki is adhyadesh ke jariye bhartiya rigerv bank kanoon-1934 main sanshodhan kiya gaya he
 This amendment has got legislative support for the announcement of the abolition of bank notes which have been left out of circulation
 is adhyadesh se kendriya bank vinirdisht tithi ke baad pratibandhit noton ke mulya ko chukaane ke daayitv se mukt ho jayega
 In the future, if there is no dispute of any kind about these notes, it is not considered enough to issue notification of demonetisation and this ordinance was brought
 band kiye gaye 500, 1,000 rupye ke puraane band note 31 march ke baad bhi ek nishchit seemaa se adhik rakhane ko kanoon ke tahat jurm mana jayega jis par 10,000 rupye yaa rakhi gai raashi ke paanch guna kaa jurmaana inamen jo bhi adhik hoga lagaaya jaayegaa
 Researchers who study and research can keep this note in the maximum number of 25
 varsh 1978 main jab morarji desai sarkaar thi tab bhi 1,000 rapaye, 5,000 rapaye or 10,000 rupye ke note amaanya karne ke baad sarkaar or rigerv bank kii ore se amaanya noton ke daayitv ko khatm karne ke liye isi tarah kaa adhyadesh laayaa gaya tha

 The result of the Israeli elections is not clear
 No party has got a majority
 The elections will not be held again if the majority government is not formed, the result of the election for the post of Prime Minister held on September 17 in Israel has not been clear
 ek baar phir halaat kuch aise bane hai ki koi bhi party apane dam par sarkaar banane ke halaat main nahin he
 The Likud Party of incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has got 31 seats, the party of opposition leader Benny Gantz has got 33 seats
 aise main agar jald hi sarkaar kaa gathan nahin hota he, to raashtrapati kii ore se ek baar phir chunaav kaa aadesh diya jayega
 That is, Israel stands on the verge of general election for the third time in a year

 a figure of 61 is needed to form a government in Israel, but both parties can reach the figure of 50 even with their alliances
 inke alaava kuch choti partiyaan hai jinke paas aise number hai jo sarkaar banane main kingmekar ho sakati hai, inhen main se ek avigdor liberman kii party ke paas abhi 8 siten hai jo sarkaar kaa rukh tay kar sakati he

 abhi ke halaat par raashtrapati revlin kaa kahana he ki vah ravivaar se sarkaar banane kii prakriya par kaam karenge, pehle donon partiyon ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit kiya jayega or aankaden maange jaaenge
 According to the President's office, there will be 42 days to form the government, apart from this, additional time of 28 days can also be found
 lekin agar ye opshan safal nahin hote hai to raashtrapati kii ore se ek baar phir chunaav kaa elaan kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the leaders of all political parties and the President himself believe that the country should not go to the polls for the third time in a single year
 isliye sarkaar banane kii koshishen jari hai

 modi sarkaar main smriti irani ke mantri banate hi congress ne unki ajukeshan ko lekar hamalaa bol diya he or bade bade netaa modi sarkaar ke khilaaf bayaanbaji karne main lag gaye hai, lekin janvari 2013 main congress kii sarkaar main jab pradhanmantri kaarylay se muradabad ke ek artiai kaaryakarta ne mantriyon kii nirdhaarit shaikshanik yogyata ke bare main poocha tha tab pradhanmantri ke kaarylay se jabaav mila ki kendriya mantriyon kii niyukti or vibhaagon kaa aavanton karne kaa pradhanmantri ko vishesh adhikaar he
 It is clear that no qualification or experience is required for the post of minister
 apane die is jabaav ke aadhaar par congress khud fansati najar aa rahi he
 RTI activist Byte Pawan Agarwal said, 'it was like this i had sought an RTI from the Prime Minister's Office on 27-11-2012, inside which the issue was that the way teachers are selected or government employees in any relevant department
 Educational qualification is chosen based on his experience etc
 har cheez ko parkhaa jaataa he uske baad uskaa chayan hota he
 'similarly, i asked the Prime Minister's Office, what educational qualification is valid for the appointment of Union Ministers who are given portfolios to them? If there is any standard related to any government order, then give me a copy of the government order
 bada chaunkaane vaala prakaran yah saamne aayaa jiske andar mujhe ek soochna mili, jisamen bataaya gaya ki kisi bhi mantri kaa jo chayan hota he, mantrimandal jo banaaya jaataa he vah donon sadanon main paas hota he
 The Prime Minister presents it, after presenting it the President stamps on it
 lekin jo mantriyon kaa chunaav hota he mantrimandal kaa jo chunaav hota he yaa usko jo chunaa jaataa he, jo rakhaa jaataa he vah pradhanmantri kaa vishesh adhikaar hota he
 According to the ruling, there is no restriction, whether it is first class, educated or illiterate
 yah soochna 2012 main maangi gai thi jiskaa jawaab 2013 main jaakar mila
 Congress was proud at that time and Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister
 pawan ne kaha, 'meraa yahi maananaa he khaastaur se yah haar kii khisyaat he, jo nikali ja rahi he
 It was said by him himself that educational qualification is not a hindrance to him, there are only two ministries, which is said to be a very high ministry of education
 is baat ko congress kah rahi he maanav vikaas sansaadhan mantralay ek bada mantralay he, lekin sahi pahaluon par na congress ne najar daali na kisi anya rajanithik party ne
 If this issue was raised about Smriti Irani and the law changes on this issue, educational qualification is accepted, then i would like that Smriti Irani also has the biggest victory in herself that the law will be amended under her pretext

 Chhota Rajan, who once lived in the shelters of Dawood Ibrahim, has become his known enemy today
 mumbai hamalon ke baad chota rajan ke alag hone se naaraaz daaud lagaataar use maarane kii firaaq main rahaa he, lekin kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa
 This is the reason Chhota Rajan is easily arrested
 25 oktober, 2015 ko indonesia ke bali main chota rajan ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 This operation was successful through successful coordination of Interpol with CBI, Intelligence Unit, Mumbai Crime Branch, Australia and Indonesia Police
 iske baad use bharat laakar tihaad jail main band kar diya gaya
 After this Dawood started plotting to kill him in jail
 haal hi main dilli ke gangster niraj bavana ke jariye vah use jail main maarane kii yojana bana rahaa tha
 Before this, his plan wearing Amali Jama was leaked
 khufia agenciyaan alert ho gayi or chota rajan kii suraksha chaak chauband kar di gai
 Neeraj Bawana was also thrown into a loneliness barrack separate from Chhota Rajan
 darasal, decompany ke gurgey or niraj bavana ke ek saathi ke bich hui baatcheet ko suraksha agenciyon ne intercept kar liya
 This showed that the company wants Chhota Rajan to be killed
 niraj bavana ke gurgon ke jariye is sajeesh ko anjaam diya janaa he
 Earlier in June this year, Dawood's special Chhota Shakeel's henchman Junaid Chaudhary was arrested

 Before coming to India, there were also several confrontations between Dawood and Chhota Rajan gang abroad
 jaanaleva hamalon kii khabaren bhi ain, lekin vah police or daaud kii najaron se bachataa rahaa
 Chhota Rajan, who always calls through voip, telephoned one of his well-wishers through whatsapp on October 24, 2015, which was taped by security agencies

 At the age of just 10, he started blackening movie tickets
 isi bich vah rajan nair gang main shaamil ho gaya
 Nair was known as 'bada Rajan' in the world of crime
 yah nair kaa dahinaa tha, isliye log ise 'chota rajan' kehane lage
 This happened to Dawood after Chhota Rajan took command of the entire gang
 isi dauraan anderworld don daaud ibrahim se iskaa sambandh ban gaya
 Together they started working in Mumbai for extortion, murder, smuggling and film finance
 1988 main vah dubai chalaa gaya
 After this, Dawood and Rajan started doing illegal work not only in India but all over the world
 mumbai main unki tuuti bolne lagi
 But in the meantime something happened that separated them
 kyon hui daaud se dushmanibharat main anderworld don daud ibrahim ke baad bade gangstaron main duusare number par chota rajan kaa hi naam aata he
 He continued working with d Company for a long time
 lekin babari cond ke baad 1993 main mumbai bam blast ne rajan ko dahala diya
 When he finds out that Dawood has a hand in this scandal, he becomes his enemy
 usne khud ko daaud se alag karke nayaa gang bana liya
 Both became known enemies of each other
 kai baar hue jaanaleva hamalemumbai blast ke baad daaud or rajan ne bharat chhod diya
 During this, both of them kept making plans to kill each other
 daaud ne chota rajan par kai baar jaanaleva hamalaa karavaaya, lekin vah bachataa rahaa
 The big conspiracy to attack Rajan was hatched in the house of Dawood's special shooter Sharad Shetty in Dubai
 saal 2000 main pizza delivery bvoy banakar aae daaud ke logon ne bangkok ke ek hotel main rajan par hamalaa kar diya
 Such was the revenge of the attack, many rounds were fired on Rajan, but he escaped from there
 kaha jaataa he ki chota rajan ko bachaane main bhartiya suraksha agenciyon kaa bhi haath tha
 However, Rajan himself denies this
 bangkok main hue hamale kaa usne badla liya
 Her brothers Ravi and Vimal, who handled her hawala business, murdered Chhota Shakeel's special Sharad Shetty at a club in Dubai in 2003
 jab chota rajan ne kaha tha, 'main jinda hum'april, 2014 main badi tezi se ek khabar udi thi
 The news was that the entire underworld as well as the police itself remained in the can
 kaha gaya ki anderworld don or di company ke jaani dushman chota rajan kii maut ho gai he
 It was also reported that Chhota Rajan's kidney was already defective
 dialasis ke dauraan uski haalat or kharaab ho gai jisase uski jaan chali gai
 After this news came, Chhota Rajan told Aaj Tak in a phone conversation
 
 
 'main jinda hum'
 False news of my death is spreading Dawood Ibrahim
 chota don par darj hai kai kesabharat main chota rajan par 65 se zyada aapraadhik cese darj he
 While in the Rajan Nair gang, there were already cases of illegal recovery, intimidation, assault and attempt to murder against him
 daaud ke saath aane ke baad uskaa krime graph bad gaya
 He has more than 20 cases of murder against him in India
 san 2011 main mumbai ke varisht patrkaar jyotirmaya de kii hatya main bhi uskaa haath mana jaataa he
 According to Indian investigative agencies, most of Chhota Rajan's shooters were from UP, according to Indian investigative agencies
 elahabaad, ambedkarnagar, barabanki, sitapur, azamgarh or jonpur jaise jilon se shooters bheje jate the
 a person named Rajesh Yadav used to supply shooters
 mumbai ke charchit kaala ghoda or farid tanasha hatyakand main rajesh kaa bhi naam aayaa tha
 Along with this, he was also close to Purvanchal's mafia don Bablu Srivastava
 aisa he chota rajan kaa samrajunderworld ke is don ne apana kaarobaar bharat se samet kar videshon main jamaaya
 According to the information received till date, after turning down work in Dubai, he moved to Malaysia
 usne jarkata main dance baar, disco or nite club khol die
 After the business froze in Malaysia, he established a similar business in Thailand
 iske alaava usne videshon main kai jagah benami sampatti arjeet kii he
 Lady Dawn is Chhota Rajan's wife, Chhota Rajan's wife's name is Sujata Nikhalje
 us par saal 2006 main ekstorshan kaa maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 He has three daughters
 ek beti britain main emb kar rahi he
 The second is engineer
 rajan kii patni sujatha urf nani chembur ke tilakanagar main rahati he
 He was detained by the Mumbai Police in connection with a ransom request from the builder
 chota rajan or sujatha kii shaadi main daaud bhi aayaa tha
 Sujatha considered Dawood a brother
 yahaan beetaa tha don kaa bachapanpaschim maharashtra ke satara ke faltan tehsil ke girvee gaanv main chota rajan kaa paitruk ghar he
 There once used to be a hut, which has now been converted into a palatial bungalow
 yahaan chota rajan ne apana bachapan bitaayaa tha
 The villagers told that Rajan's brothers keep coming here for family function
 is bangale main rajan ke pita sadashiv sakhaaraam nikalje kii murti bhi he, jo 50 ke dashak main mumbai chale gaye the
 His family members go to the ancestral village
 An elder of the ancestral village states that he was a good child
 aksar unki dukaan par aata tha
 Her family always visited the village during summer and Diwali holidays
 anderworld kii duniya main kukhyat hone ke baad rajan ne gaanv aana chhod diya
 However his wife and brother keep coming to the village when there is a ceremony in the family
 1976 main rajan ke pita kii mrityu ho gai thi
 This is called fruit of labor! When we hear this, it just makes me feel so so proud of our country that produces so much talent and is so rich in culture
 Who is this guy ??? How can i trace him? Need help & would like to work with him

 com / swqgqkmchb The anger of the people regarding the death of three girls from starvation in Delhi's Mandawali has not yet calmed
 maamle ko lekardillischivalay ke baahar takreeban 500 logon nepradarshnakia
 Let us know that about a month has passed since this incident
 ek NGO chalaane vaali anjali bharadwaj kaa maamle main kahana he ki mandavali main bacchiyon kibhukh se mautki ghatana ko puraa ek maheenaa biit chukaa he
 Today, people have gathered outside the secretariat from all the districts of Delhi, because there is an expectation that the government will now take at least some concrete steps, so that such traumatic incidents do not happen next
 desh menkhaadya suraksha kanoonpaas ho chukaa he, uske tahatadillisarkaar ko niyam banane the or niyamon main yah likhaa janaa chahie tha ki soshal audit kaise hoga? dilli main ek khaadya ayukta kii niyukti honi thi or khaadya ayog banaaya janaa tha
 But four years have passed, but no commission has been formed yet
 pradarshan main shaamil anjali bharadwaj ne kaha ki mandavali main jahaan parbachaayiyon kii mautahui, vahaan par log gaye to maaloom padaa he ki us sthaan par anganbari sahi se nahin chal rahi he
 If the Food Corporation is not formed in Delhi, then people will continue to die in this way
 pradarshan main shaamil raheen amrutha johri kaa kahana he ki ham logon ne maang rakhi he ki khaadya ayog banaaya jaae or soshal audit ho, taaki bacchon ko doodh, anda or fal samet anya paushtik aahaar mil saken
 At the same time, people protesting for the demand for food security were told on behalf of the government that the food minister is not in Delhi
 jab khaadya mantri dilli main aaenge to janata ke saath unki meeting hogi
 The protesters appealed that the demand for the appointment of the Food Commissioner be met soon, or else they would knock the court on this issue

 In Delhi's Mayur Vihar area, vehicle thieves cleaned hands on a Fortuner vehicle
 yah vaardaat mangalvaar raat kii he
 This third car of the victim has been stolen from this society
 isse pehle unki do gaadiyaan bhi isi sosayadi se chori hui thim

 The victims reside in pocket-b located at Navneet Mayur Vihar-2
 mangalvaar raat kareeb 10 baje unhone apni fortuner gaadi ghar ke saamne park kii thi
 Navneet was shocked when he came to know about the incident
 sosayadi main lage sisitivi camere kii footage se maamle kaa puraa khulaasa hua
 It is clear in the footage that the thieves in the Swift car cleaned their hands on the Fortuner
 footage ke mutabik, swift car savaar chor pehle fortuner ke paas aate hai
 During this time, the guard of the society passes through, due to which the vehicle thieves do not get out of their car
 thodi der baad jaise hi guard vahaan se hatataa he to swift savaar 2 chor baahar aate hai or mauka dekh kar fortuner car ke shishe todakar andar ghus jate hai
 Then Reiki the area for some time and seeing the opportunity, along with his car, the Fortuner left the society
 peedit kaa kahana he ki ye pehla aisa maamla nahin he jab is tarah kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya ho
 a few months ago, Puneet, a resident of the same neighborhood, had a Scorpio car stolen
 scorpiyo se pehle punit kaa ek or gaadi chori ho chuki he
 Navneet told that such incidents are happening again and again
 aise main police kii manshaa par sawaal uthanaa lajimi he
 In the wake of alleged fraudulent activity from millions of investors in West Bengal in a short-term lure (ponzi) schemes, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) chairman UK Sinha today said that the regulator is working hard to ensure Is doing so that there is no risk to the savings of small investors
 unhone kaha, apane kshetradhikaar ke daayre main sebi yah sunishchit karne ke liye behad kadi mehnat kar rahaa he ki chote niveshkon kii bachat ko koi khatra na ho
 Sinha, however, said that SEBI has certain legal limitations and would not be able to comment on specific issues related to certain companies as there have been some court and quasi-judicial orders in specific cases
 unhone kaha, main haalanki, aap sabko aashwast karnaa chaahunga ki ham apane daayitv ke prati satark hai

 newjiland ke cricketer grant aliot ne vanade cricket se sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar di
 He will however continue to play T20 cricket
 eliet ne ek bayaan main kaha, 'main sabakuch sahi ho jane ke baad ek baar phir se sochoongaa
 i still enjoy cricket
 maine abhi tak kisi cheez par faisla nahin liya
 i played my last ODI but there are three formats of cricket
 'unhone apane desh ke liye 83 vanade match khele hai jisamen 34
 Has scored 1,976 runs at an average of 06
 vanade main unke naam do shatak or 11 ardhashatak bhi darj hai
 He had said in September 2015 that he would think about his international career after the World T20 World Cup
 pichley hafte release hui film shridevi starr "mom" ko critics kii tarif mili or dhire dhire darshakon kaa pyaar bhi lekin wo pyaar box offis par or bad saktaa tha
 Had Spiderman not broken the color, because Spiderman beat Mom
 "mom" ke pehle din kaa collection taqariban paune teen karod tha lekin veekend collection 15 karod tak pahunchaa jo bahut acha he lekin vahiin spiderman kaa hafte kaa bijnes rahaa 25 karod
 Till now Spiderman has done 40 crore business only in India
 ji haan jo bahut badi baat he mom ko faaydaa or zyada hota agar saamne spiderman nahin hoti
 The cost of mom is high, so if the business of this film is around 50 crores, then this film will be considered safe
 agle hafte par nirbhar karegaa mom kaa kya hoga,vaise agle hafte ranbir kapur or katrina kaiff kii "jagga jasoos" bhi release ho rahi he
 The audience will be divided once again, but if "jagga Jasoos" is not adopted by the audience, then "mom" can get the benefit
 philhal bollywood ko ye sochane kii sakht zarurat he ki hollywood lagbhag har hafte use comptishan de rahaa he
 If good films are not made in Bollywood, business will not be good either
 aap desh ke kisi purv pradhanmantri ke kaamkaaj yaa hamaare rajnatik itihaas main unki yogya jagah ko thik-thik kaise or kab aank sakate hai? aap aaj desh ke twanti-20 tip tivi samachar channelon yaa das main se kitne ank vaale 'vishleshan' ke tareeke se to nahin hi aank sakate
 Nor can you learn anything from the great Chinese leader Chow in Lai for this
 unase 1971 main henry kisinger ne apni pehali mulaakaat ke dauraan ek din poocha tha ki itihaas main francisi kranti ke asar ke bare main aap kya sochate hai
 He said that it is too early to say anything
 to, ek dashak yaa thik-thik 11 saal baad aise hi ek sawaal kaa jawaab talashne kaa shaayad sahi samay he
 Then, the Narendra Modi government has given Atal Bihari Vajpayee a Bharat Ratna and has given us a good reason
 apana kaarykaal puraa karne vaale kisi pradhanmantri, khaskar nirvaachit lokapriy netaa, ke kaamkaaj ke akalan kaa ek ahm tatv yah he ki unhone kis iraade se, kaise shuruyaat kii or apni vidaai ke baad kis rup main yaad kiya janaa chaahate rahe hai
 In this case, Vajpayee is really on the notch
 aaie dekhte hai kaise
 There remains a broad uniformity towards the economic and foreign policy of the country
 isliye koi netaa uske vistaar or raftaar main hi badlaav kar saktaa he
 But this is not a big job
 asli badlaav to maansikta main hota he
 That is, someone should come up with such a big idea, which will challenge the old root idea and make its place such that it is not possible to separate from it in future
 nehru kaa udaar bahultawad aisa hi ek vichaar tha
 Even Modi has to raise his voice, even if he prefers to do it in the name of Patel and Gandhi
 nehru kaa doosraa yogadan vaigyanik soch vaale tarksmmat, jigyaasu tathaa secular samaaj kii sthapana he, jo aaj bhi kaayam he
 But it will be tested in the coming years as political debate can begin in the country on one important aspect of it, that is, the contradiction between their almost secular secularism and deeply religious society may be questioned
 unka teesraa yogadan nehruwadi yaa fabian samaajwaad puri tarah dharashayi ho gaya he or khaskar nehru kii apni party kii hi ek sarkaar (pi
 V
 narsingh raav, manmohan singh ke tahat) ne uskaa smritilekh likh diya
 Something similar is also with Indira Gandhi
 vishwa manch par bade rajnatik khel se parhez na karne vaale taqatvar bharat kaa unka vichaar kaayam rahegaa or bijepi keraj main or majbootee paaegaa, kyonki bijepi ne congress ke pratik purushon madan mohan malviya, sardaar patel or ab bahadur shastri ko aatmsaat kar aage badaae kaa man bana liya he
 However, under the slogan of Garibi Hatao, his aggressive idea of equal distribution of poverty is now dead, buried and now ridiculed as poorism
 2014 main unki party ko mili mahaj 44 saansad unke vichaaron kaa taabut sabit hue or koyala tathaa khanij kanoonon main sanshodhan or rajyon main shram kanoonon main dheel dene kaa vichaar usamen aakhri keel sabit hoga
 Now let's have a different P
 ve
 Consider Narasimha Rao
 nehru-indira daur ke teen saidhantik stambhon main se do-sarkaarparast samaajwaad or pashchimaviruddh vishwa niti-raav ke paanch saal ke kaarykaal main hi dhahna shuru hue
 Rao was a socialist but more pragmatic than him
 unhen nehru-gandhi parivaar par lage lagbhag saat saal ke grahan se kaaphi madad mili
 For five years, he would have been Prime Minister directly and then two years in the era of Deve gowda-gujral when his new ideas were preferred
 congress ke samarthan se sanyukt morcha kii donon sarkaron ne apni arthvyavastha pi
 Was handed over to Chidambaram who used to be in Tamil Manila Congress
 congress apane party itihaas ke pannon main unka naam chaahe jis kadar dafna de lekin raav bauddhik jang jeet chuke the or unke mushkil bhare paanch varshon ko kabhi bhi aaazaad bharat ke itihaas ke pannon se mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 Just after him, Vajpayee (after short-lived United Front governments), who followed in his footsteps, is the first non-congress prime minister to last five, in fact, six years
 bich main ek chota jhatka 1999 main unhen loksabhaa main vishwaas mat main haar kaa laga tha or ve dobaaraa chunaav ladgaye ko majaboor hue
 This was his third election in three years
 raav or vaajapeyi donon hi puraane diggaj saansad the or aapas main ek-duusare kaa bada aadar karte the
 Vajpayee always considered Rao an experienced, intelligent patriot and did not look at him with suspicion like the nehru-gandhi family
 raav bhi vaajapeyi ko apni hi tarah kaa netaa maanate the
 However, there was a lot of contradiction between the two personalities
 yaad kiijie, raav ne unhen sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar ayog main bharat ke khilaaf prastaav ke dauraan bhartiya pratinidhimandal kaa netaa banaakar bheja tha, jabaki tab videsh rajyamantri salmaan khurshid unke dipti kii bhoomika main the
 He never hated Vajpayee either personally or ideologically
 vah 'sammaan' to adwani ke liye surakshit tha
 That is why i have full faith in this story that Rao handed over power (though initially for just 13 days) to Vajpayee, saying that all the material (nuclear etc) is ready and he should move on as soon as the mandate is received
 raav ne nehru-indira daur kii arthvyavastha or videsh niti main jo saahasik badlaav kiye, ve baad main bhi kaayam rahe, balki usee raah par desh or majbootee se bad rahaa he
 After the economic and foreign policy was fixed, what was there to do for Vajpayee? Vajpayee was a staunch rssist, but to some extent, like Nehru, a liberal constitutionalist and romantic, even poet
 ve indira, raav yaa ab modi kii tarah nirankush iraadon ke dhani nahin the or na hi ve nehru kii tarah doordarshee the
 But his mind was open and above all, his heart was very big
 ishwar kabhi kisi netaa ko saare gun ek saath dekar nahin bhejtaa
 In history, there is a shortage or shortcoming even among the greatest leaders
 lekin yah akatya satya he ki kisi bhi kshetra main koi mahaan netaa bade dil ke bina na aaj tak bana he or na kabhi banegaa
 Vajpayee Bilashak proves to be the best on this criterion
 is fehrist main ham manmohan singh par vichaar nahin kar rahe hai kyonki ve puri tarah adhikaar sampann netaa nahin ban paae
 Vajpayee was not even the first time when he was sworn in as the leader of the largest party in 1996
 ve jaanate the ki sansad main vishwaas mat par ve apni pehali pariksha main hi thode dinon baad hi naakaam ho jane vaale hai kyonki samoochaa vipaksh unke khilaaf secular chhatari main ekajute ho gaya tha
 But he had made up his mind for this and his heart was ready to plan such that he was going to secure his special place in history
 vishwaas mat par sansad main bahes kaa jawaab dene ke maukey ke do din pehle mujhe unke puraane raisina road ke awaas se mulaakaat ke liye phone aayaa
 He had not changed the residence knowing that his innings was going to be short
 ve shant, sahaj the or muskaraa bhi rahe the
 He asked, 'I remember that you had once written that the majority of people in India are victims of one kind of minority gland
 'maine kaha haa, vah lekh maine international institute of stratagic studies, landan par (india ridifines its role, 1995) isi patrika ke liye likhaa tha
 He got involved in a small debate with me about why Hindus in India feel hurt despite being in such large numbers
 unhone kaha ki ve samajhate hai ki aisa kyon he lekin usase puri tarah sahamat nahin hai
 Then he said that in such a way, he is not an elected Prime Minister to express regret to Hindus, but his job is to get him out of this mess and also to reassure the minorities
 unhen pataa tha ki sansad main haar hone vaali he phir bhi unhone sansad main bahusnkhyakon main is alpsankhyak granthi par bhavuk bhaashan diya
 Even in that defeat, he told the Parliament of the country and the common people that he is not a general BJP / RSS type leader
 lihaaja, isse do baaten huin
 One, besides the bjp's committed voters, a large number of people agreed to give him a chance
 duusare, secular chhatari kii kai choti partiyaan endie kii taraf jane kaa bharosa paa gayi
 Remember, Nitish Kumar, Mamta Banerjee, Naveen Patnaik, even Omar Abdullah of the National Conference were included in his cabinet
 apane chah varshon ke kaarykaal main unhone bhartiya raajnneeti main do nae vichaar sthapit kiye
 One, the BJP can run a right-wing moderate government in the framework of the current constitution
 yah bhi sabit kiya ki bharat bijepi ko zyada badal saktaa he na ki bijepi bharat ko
 Secondly, the policy of strategic restraint can also be sustained in maximum incitement as demonstrated by the attack on Kargil and Parliament
 iske phaayde bhi spasht the
 One was the sanctity of the Line of Control, and the other, Pakistan was established as a country that promotes terrorism worldwide
 is duusari avadharana kii pariksha aane vaale varshon main hogi
 But first, Vajpayee's definition of Rajdharma was established for the BJP
 ab agar modi golwalkar ke badale vaajapeyi kii avadharana kii kaul uthaate hai to bijepi ke liye desh main prashasnic vichaardhaara kaa aayam aage bhi kaayam rahegaa
 This is his most enduring contribution and it is as strong as Nehru's liberalism, Indira's powerful country and Rao's pragmatism

 Till a year ago, people of Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh used to go to the capital Raipur, about 80 km away to watch cinema
 mahaj do lakh kii aabaadi vaale is shahar main multiplex to dur, ek parade vaala cinemaghar bhi nahin tha
 The first cinema hall opened here in March this year when Sachit Jain, the third generation in the film distributor family, stepped in and opened a two-screen cinema
 ve kehete hai, ''rajanandgaanv jaisi jagah main do paradon vaala cinemaghar phydemand he kyonki akasar do filmein ek saath yaa ek-ke-baad hafton main relies hoti hai
 According to Jain, who hails from Mumbai, 70% of the tickets are sold at his cinema hall in Rajnandgaon on most days and people from nearby villages also visit
 haalanki tikaton kii ausat keemat 100 ru
 And expensive seats Rs 150
 kii hai
 Jain says, "in Rajnandgaon where there is no restaurant or entertainment, people are willing to spend so much to watch movies
 ham do paradon vaale cinemaghar se unhen multiplex jaisaa anubhav de rahe hai
 Apart from Rajnandgaon, Jain has opened two screen cinemas in Dhamtari in Chhattisgarh and Gondia in Maharashtra
 unki yojana 2014 ke ant tak 12 aise or cinemaghar kholane kii he
 Theater chains such as Ranchi's Alexey Films and Mumbai's Maxus Cinema and Gold Cinema are also building two-screen cinemas in relatively small cities and towns
 ye ve jagahen hai jahaan aath parade vaale multiplex phydemand nahin hai
 Tushar Kulkarni, CEO of movie consultancy firm Republic Film Company, says, "investors are focusing on small spaces where there is a shortage of good cinemas
" aise main mahaj 6,000 varg foot main bane do parade vaale cinemaghar hi fishan main aa rahe hai
 "what is the ultimate reason for such a trend and interest in small towns and cities by theater chains? In fact, all the small towns and towns were left out of the multiplex revolution which was experienced by the people of most of the big cities of the country after PVR Limited built the first multiplex in Delhi in the 1990s
 piviar ke alaava big cinemaz, inox, fan cinemaz jaisi duusari badi multiplex chaiyn ne chote shaharon main janaa munasib nahin samajha kyonki aisi jagahon par jahaan log 100 ru
 Even if you are not ready to buy tickets and single screen theaters are providing cheaper options, it was not beneficial to open expensive multiplexes there
 (surat ke pehle ke video parlor aaj dabl scrin theatre main tabdeel)chote shaharon main filmon ko relies hone main kai baar maheenon lag jate hai or aise main bahut saare log nakli video casette se ve filmein dekh lete hai
 Kulkarni says, "that was the era of analog technology and a print of distributor film was Rs 70,000
 se 75,000 ru
 Used to sell in itani mahangi keemat par vitarak puure desh ke liye sirf 30-35 print hi banaate the isliye chote shaharon main print pahunchane main do se teen maheene lag jate the
 The economics of the film performance business began to change from 2005 when digital technology became popular
 uafo movies or real image jaisi companiyon ne digital takanic kii peshkash kii to analog print ke mukaable keemten paanchvaan hissaa bhar rah gayi
 This led to distributors buying more prints and filming across the country on the very first day of release
 uafo movies ke sioo pankaj jaisingh kehete hai, ''pichley kuch saal se filmein analog or digital donon hi formet main relies ho rahi hai lekin dhooma 3 or jai ho jaisi kuch haal kii filmein sirf digital formet main relies huin
 “the digital revolution has led to a boom in the film display business not only in metros, but also in small towns
 is maamle main surat ek misaal he
 This industrial city of Gujarat is famous for its video parlors
 ye parlor mahanagaron main koi film relies hone ke hafte bhar ke bheetar uskaa pirated video dikhaa diya karte the
 Now all these have been transformed into one-screen or two-screen cinemas and digital print shows films with the entire country on a single day
 isse unki aamadani bhi bad gai he
 The price of movie tickets also doubled to Rs 30
 or saptahanth main 50 ru
 has occurred
 is avasar ko silver screen or elex jaisi companiyon ne hathohath le liya
 These companies are mostly building two-screen theaters in smaller cities and many companies are also recovering one-screen theaters from bankruptcy
 masalan, elex ne jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi or jammu-kashmir ke katra main ek parade vaala cinemaghar liya he
 The company doubled the price of tickets by redesigning these loss-making theaters
 ab ausat tikat 40 ru
 And the most expensive ticket is Rs 140
 ke hai
 He also reduced seats to make them profitable
 ranchi ke cinemaghar main 800 kii jagah 530 siten kar di gayi
 Anand Lohia, director of Alex, says, "the theater which earned just Rs 1 lakh a month ago
 thi, ab vahi 25 lakh ru
 Is earning ”desh ke purvi anchal main 33 cinemagharon vaali is company kaa ranchi main do parade vaala bhi ek cinemaghar he
 Lohia says that its two theaters in Ranchi have ticket sales of up to 55 per cent, while the city's multiplexes only sell 30 per cent of tickets
 silver screen or elex jaisi companiyon kii yah kamyaabi kai dusron ko bhi apane kaarobaar kaa model badalane kii ore khinch rahi he
 Sameer B
, director of Chandan Cinema in Juhu, Mumbai
 joshi bataate hai ki ve nae brands naam recept ke jariye chote shaharon main do parade vaale cinemaghar banane kii yojana bana rahe hai lekin ek parade vaale chandan cinema ko do parade vaala banane kaa koi tuk nahin samajhate
 Ramesh Sippy of film distributor company Raksha Entertainment says that Mangla and Westend in Pune and Sharad Cinema in Mumbai will soon go from one screen to two screens
 sippi kaa naam 1970 main dhansu film sholay ke mashhoor nideshak jaisaa he
 He says that he would prefer to release the film in a smaller sized two-screen cinema hall instead of a big one-screen cinema as a distributor, thereby earning him a fixed amount
 ve kehete hai, ''kareeb 1,000 siton vaala cinemaghar kabhi munaafe main nahin rah saktaa
 If he is shown in two different films by dividing it into two parts, then he will make more profit

 The urge to learn Chinese and Hindi language is increasing rapidly among Chinese and Indian students so that they can take advantage of the flourishing bilateral trade
 china main ucch shiksha ke sabase pratishthit santhaan peking vishvavidhyalay main in dinon hindi kii bayaar bah rahi he kyonki deshbhar ke 100 se adhik hindi chaatr or praadhyaapak parisar main bharat diwas manaane ke liye jute hai

 In India, Chinese language will be introduced in CBSE syllabus from next year, so that we will become Chindustani

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke purv pradhan sachiv rajendra kumaar ke maamle main sibiai ne kai ahm daawey kiye hai
 The exclusive copy of the application which the CBI presented before the court before taking Rajendra Kumar on remand, is available with TV Today Network
 sibiai ne remand maangane ke liye kai ahm sabooton kii baat adaalat ke saamne kahi or us aadhaar par das dinon kii remand maangi, lekin adaalat ne mahaj paanch dinon kii hi remand manjuur kii
 The important evidence that the country's largest investigative agency has talked about is important: Kirajendra Kumar, when he was working in different posts in Delhi government, he misused the government posts since 2007, a company Endeavor Systems Private Limited
 9 to the company
 5 karod rupee ke tender ke kaam main madad kii he
 The ESPL, under Rajendra Kumar, has also been charged by the investigating agency that the design process has been changed so that the ESPL company can be benefited
 daawa ye bhi kiya gaya he ki puri prakriya menciemke purv pradhan sachiv ne sakriy bhoomika nibhaai
 The CBI arrested Rajendra Kumar, Tarun Sharma, Ashok Kumar, Dinesh Kumar Gupta and Sandeep Kumar in this case, and also claimed that they were not cooperating in the investigation
 ab tak kii jaanch main sibiai ne ye bhi daawa kiya he ki jin bhi vibhaagon main rajendra kumaar rahe vahaan se iespiel company ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 The investigative agency also claims that around 3 under commission and bribe
 3 karod kii raashi iespiel ke khaaton main jamaa kii gai, jise baad main real estate, shiksha, prakaashan aadi ke kshetra main laga diya gaya
 It has also been claimed that Rajendra Kumar also misused his official positions for all this
 sibiai ne kiye bade-bade davesibiai ke daavon ko maane to unhen kuch audio clip bhi mili hai, jisamen aaropee aapas main baat kar rahe hai, jisejaanchake liye siefel lab bheja gaya gaya he
 It has also been claimed that some such e-mails have also been received, which gives information about how to benefit ESPL unfairly
 yani sibiai ne daawey to bade kiye hai lekin chunauti ye he ki agar in dovon ko adaalat main sabit nahin kiya ja sakaa to kirakiri bhi khub hogi

 filmon main bhale hi pakistani betiyon ko unke parivaar waalon se milwaaya ja rahaa ho, lekin hazaron pakistani betiyaan aisi hai jinaki hindustani ladakon se shaadi hui, lekin wo is nae parivaar kaa hissaa nahin ban paa rahi hai
 She is not getting passport, due to which she is facing all kinds of difficulties
 ye kahani un hazaron pakistani ladakiyon kii he, jinaki shaadi hindustani ladakon se hui he
 She wants to become an Indian, but she is not getting citizenship of this country
 iske nattejey main wo naa to apane shuhar kii jaaydaad main hissedaar ban sakati hai, naa hi zamin kareed sakati hai, naa to makaan bana sakati hai, naa naukari kar sakati hai or naa hi bina ijazat shahar ke baahar ja sakati hai
 Pakistani daughter and Hindustani daughter-in-law Kaneez Fatima is wandering in mosques and imambads in Lucknow because she is not sent back to Pakistan
 wo 30 saal pehle shaadi ke baad pakistan ke karachi se lakhanu ain thim, lekin tamaam koshishon ke baavjood unhen bharat kii naagarikta nahin mili
 Knees said, 'in Pakistan and India we will get such a big punishment, we did not know
 ab hamase koi poochhega, to ham usko aisa karne kii haragij raay nahin denge
 ' vastav main kanij pakistani passport se bharat ain thi
 When the baby was about to happen, she moved back to Karachi
 betaa vahiin paidaa hua
 When she came to India with her son, the housemates got her son a Pakistani passport
 ab na to unhen bharat kii naagarikta mil rahi he or na hi bete ko bhartiya passport
 Still won the case from the High Court
 rampur ke kumhariya gaanv ke sarkari skool main padhaane vaali farjaana ab nahin padhaatin
 He has been replaced by another teacher
 unke saath bhartiya police kaa saluk vaisaa hi he jaisaa ki bajrangi bhaijan film main bajrangi ke saath pakistani police kaa tha
 While he was born in India
 unki shaadi pakistan main hui, to vahaan kii naagarikta mil gai
 But two years later, they divorced
 wo besahaara hokar waapas bharat ke rampur aa gayi
 Taught children in school for two years
 phir vahiin principal ho gayi, lekin kisi ne unhen pakistani bataakar shikaayat kar di, to skool ne suspend kar diya
 Now they are underground in their homeland
 tippaniyan DM of Rampur CP Tripathi said, 'in one case which is of Farzana B, all the reports have come from the original education officer and Captain Sahab in connection with that case
 uske bare main ham shashan ko akhya bhej rahe hai
 ' aise kai maamle hai
 Many of these Pakistani passports have also ended, so that she cannot even go to Pakistan to meet her old parents
 inhen bhi kisi bajrangi bhaijan kii zarurat he jo inhen hindustani banavaa de
 This story is of thousands of Pakistani girls who are married to Hindustani boys
 wo hindustani bananaa chaahati hai, lekin unhen is mulk kii naagarikta nahin mil rahi he
 As a result, she can neither become a partner in her husband's property, nor can she buy land, neither build a house, nor do a job nor go out of the city without permission
 pakistani beti or hindustani bahu kanij fatima lakhanu main masjidon or imambadon main isliye bhatak raheen hai ki unhen waapas pakistan nahin bheja jaae
 She came to Lucknow from Karachi, Pakistan after her marriage 30 years ago, but despite all efforts she did not get citizenship of India
 kanij ne kaha, 'pakistan or hindustan main shaadi kii itani badi sajaa milegi, hamen nahin maaloom tha
 Now, if someone asks us, we will not give him the opinion of doing so
 ' In fact, Kanise came to India with a Pakistani passport
 baccha hone vaala tha to waapas karachi chalin gayi
 Son was born there
 jab bete ko lekar hindustan ain to ghar waalon ne bete kaa pakistani passport banavaa diya
 Now neither he is getting citizenship of India nor son has Indian passport
 hoicourt se cese jeet chuki hai phir bhi nahin
 Farzana, who teaches at a government school in Kumharia village in Rampur, no longer teaches
 unki jagah duusare shikshak ne le lee he
 The treatment of the Indian police with him is the same as that of the Pakistani police with Bajrangi in the film Bajrangi Bhaijaan
 jabaki unka janm bharat main hi hua he
 They got married in Pakistan, then got citizenship there
 lekin do saal baad hi talaak ho gaya
 She came back to Rampur in India, being helpless
 do saal tak skool main bacchon ko padhaayaa
 Then she became the principal there, but when someone complained to them as Pakistani, the school suspended it
 ab wo apane vatan main hi underground hai
 The comments rampur ke dm seepi treepathi ne kaha, 'ek prakaran jo farjaana bi kaa he, us cese ke sambandh main mul shiksha adhikari or captain sahab ke yahaan se sari aakhyaayen aa gai hai
 We are sending a report about that to the government
 ' There are many such cases
 inamen se kai ke to pakistani passport bhi khatm ho gaye hai, jisase wo apane buudhe maa-baap se milane pakistan bhi nahin ja sakati hai
 They too need a Bajrangi Bhaijaan who can make them Hindustani
 pakistani beti or hindustani bahu kanij fatima lakhanu main masjidon or imambadon main isliye bhatak raheen hai ki unhen waapas pakistan nahin bheja jaae
 She came to Lucknow from Karachi, Pakistan after her marriage 30 years ago, but despite all efforts she did not get citizenship of India

 The constitution bench of the court has started hearing on the petition to review this decision from Tuesday
 dilli kaa lalita park haadasa rajdhani main bane gaiyrkanoonee nirmaanon kaa jeeta-jaagta udhaaharan he
 These buildings, built by following the rules, can invite a big danger anytime
 khatra ek do jagahon par nahin he, dilli main saikadon aisi colniyaan hai jo aise haadason ke muhane par khadi he
 There are also streets in the capital which are full of high-rise buildings
 halaat aise hai ki in galiyon main kisi bhi vakt laksminagar jaise haadase duhraaye ja sakate hai
 There are definitely such colonies in almost every area of delhi where the network of narrow streets is spread
 aisi galiyaan jinamein ek duusare se chipkar aasmaan chooti imaaraten bani hai
 Alam is that even the sun's light does not touch the earth properly
 puraani dilli kii galiyaan bhi kam khatarnaak nahin
 All the time, they make sense of some fatal danger
 yahaan sau saal se bhi puraani imaaraton ki bharmaar he jinhen turant marammat kii jarurat he
 But nobody paid attention to this

 In South Delhi too, there will be many lanes waiting for accidents

 Thousands of families are living life in the streets of narrow streets everywhere
 galiyaan choti hoti hai lekin imaaraton kii oonchai din ba din badhati chali jaati he, vah bhi gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se
 In some areas, drains are also becoming a major reason for the weakening of buildings
 dilli ke brahmpuri ilaake main naalon kaa bahata pani imaaraton kii neenv khokhli karata rahata he
 This area has also suffered the brunt of the collapse of buildings many times
 aakadon kii maane to dilli kii 3 hajaar coloniyon main se 1639 colniyaan gaiyrkanoonee hai
 In which about 2
5 million population lives
 dilli main 32 lakh se zyada imaaraten hai
 According to the Municipal Corporation, 70 percent of these buildings are definitely illegal
 up rajyapal ne kaha he ki aisi coloniyon ko chinhit kiya jaae
 The big question is, why are accidents like Laxminagar awaited before taking any step? After all, who is responsible for turning these buildings that give roofs to people in the debris of death like this? After all, how long will we see precious lives due to the mistakes of some people in the face of death? vaajapeyi ko 2014 main desh ke sarvocch sammaan bharat ratna se sammanit kiya gaya tha

 BJP general secretary and UP election in-charge Amit Shah has said that once Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister, then the Muslim apprehensions about him will be eliminated because policy initiatives will be taken for this
 modi ke kaaphi kareebi maane jane vaale shah ne in aalochanaon ko sire se khaarij kar diya ki modi kaa kad party se bada ho gaya he
 He said that Modi and the party are not separate from each other
 shah ne kaha ki agar modi pradhanmantri bane tab kisi ko darane kii jarurat nahin he jaisaa bhram congress or kuch anya dal failaa rahe hai
 He said, 'if Modi becomes Prime Minister, then on the basis of his rule, these fears will be resolved
 yah isse pehle nahin hoga
 These fears have taken root after a long time in the media
 'shah ne daawa kiya ki varanasi ke road sho main anya logon ke saath kaaphi sankhya main musalamaanon ne modi kaa khule mane se swaagat kiya or iske liye party pavitra nagari ke logon kii abhaari he
 In response to a question about Modi wave, he said that wave is for both BJP and Modi
 modi lahar or bijepi lahar yah media kii utpatti he
 Modi and BJP cannot be separated
 yah puche jane par ki agar sarkaar banane ke liye nae sahyogiyon kii jarurat padi tab bijepi pahal karegi, shah ne kaha ki party ko 272 seat se adhik milane kaa bharosa he kyonki deshbhar main party ko kaaphi samarthan mil rahaa he
 When asked about the bjp's hopes in UP, Shah said that it will emerge as the largest party where it got only 10 seats in 2009
 unhone kaha, main sankhya ke bare main baat nahin karnaa chahta
 We got 10 seats in the last election, this time we will emerge as the largest party and there will be a big difference of seats between the first and second places
 'shah ne kaha ki party ne modi ko is kshetra se chunaav ladaane kaa faisla kiya he taaki purvanchal or bihar main party ko madad mil sake
 He said, 'this is an internal matter of the BJP
 unhen hindi pattee main kahin se bhi ladanaa tha
 The party assessed that fighting them from Varanasi would help in the entire Purvanchal, Bihar and surrounding areas
 'varanasi main modi kii raily ko mili jabardast samarthan kaa zikr karte hue shah ne kaha ki yah party kii sambhaavnaaon ko pradarshit karata he
 When asked about Modi's allegations of spending large amounts of money in the election, Shah termed them as baseless and said that if Congress has proof then it can go to the Election Commission
 unke or bijepi ke kai netaaon ke aapattijanak bayaan dene ke bare main puche jane par shah ne kaha ki unka kahana yah nahin tha jaisaa ki chunaav ayog kii ore se pesh kiya gaya lekin vah ayog ke nirdeshon ko sweekaar karte hai
 He said, 'I have already said that this was not my intention and i accept the commission's point

 Last year, India beat Pakistan in the final of the Incheon Asiad and created history and got the Rio Olympic ticket
 vahiin duusari taraf, bhubaneshwar main hui champions trophy ke dauraan pakistan team ne bharat ko haraakar us haar kaa badla liya
 After the victory, many Pakistani players took off their shirts and whipped the fans of Bhubaneswar and made that victory bitter
 qareeb chah maheene baad donon timen ek baar phir 26 june ko takaraaengi, to tiimon kii ranneeti or khilaadiyon kii fitaness ke alaava unke bich dabaav ek bada mudda hoga
 It is sure that Antwerp will not have the number of fans like India and Pakistan, yet the team will be under pressure from the old matches
 team hockey india ke dach coach paul vine haas kii ek or mushkil he- rupinder paal singh kaa chotil hona
 They do not even refuse to accept it

 Coach Haas admits that the team's drag flicking has weakened due to Rupinder's lack
 ye kami pehle do maichon main ubharkar saamne aa gai
 In the first two matches, Team Hockey India managed to convert only one penalty corner out of six
 rupinder ko warm ap maichon ke dauraan chot lagi
 But the coach says that Rupinder will be fit against Pakistan and get on the field
 pichley do saal main rupinder or viaar raghunatha kii vajah se team india ko kai maichon main badi kamyaabi hasil kii he
 Coach Haas has included Rupinder in the squad due to Raghunath being injured before the tournament
 wo rupinder se pakistan ke kilaaf form main hone kii ummid zarur karenge
 Haas is working on a variety of penalty corner options
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, midfielder Lalit Upadhyay has cleared the team's strategy a bit more
 team management ne ishaara kiya he ki wo ball poseshan par khaas dhyaan denge
 That is, Team Hockey India would also like to control the match speed

 India has won 54 matches and Pakistan has won 80 matches in 161 matches between the two
 ek baar phir bharat-paak match kaa bukaar jor pakadaney laga he or ek baar phir se romaanch bhi badhane laga he
 On the other hand, during the Champions Trophy in Bhubaneswar, Pakistan team avenged that defeat by defeating India
 jeet ke baad kai pakistani khilaadiyon ne shart utarkar bhubaneshwar ke fans ko kosa or us jeet ko kadava bana diya
 After almost six months, the two teams will once again clash on June 26, in addition to the strategy and fitness of the players, the pressure between them will be a big issue
 ye zarur he ki entwarp main bharat or pakistan kii tarah fans kii sankhya nahin hogi, phir bhi team par puraane maichon kaa dabaav to hoga hi
 Dutch coach Paul van Haas of Team Hockey India has another problem - the injury of Rupinder Pal Singh
