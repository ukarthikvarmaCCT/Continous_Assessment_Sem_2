 In his previous article 'will Pakistan be stable now? 
 
 ?' main maine zikr kiya tha ki aatankwaad ko lekar pakistan ne kis tarah dogali niti apanaai hui he
 How has there been a difference between 'good terrorism' and 'bad terrorism'
 bharat main ashaanti or asthirataa failaane vaale or jagah-jagah bam dhamaake karke nirdosh bharatiyon ko maarane vaale aatankwaadiyon ko pakistan hameshaa se swantatrata senaanee kahata aayaa he or unhen sarankshan detaa rahaa he
 There is also a bitter truth that the existence of Pakistan is left due to the anti-india policy, otherwise it would have been shattered
 mangalvaar ko peshawar ke skool main hue aatmghaatee aatankwaadi hamale ke baad duniya ko laga ki pakistan ab sudhar jayega
 When Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif decided in an all party meeting that now Pakistan will not differentiate between the good and the bad Taliban and will not sit quietly until the last terrorist is eliminated, every 'tv-made' defense expert will say Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan was taking steps in the right direction, but soon the misunderstanding of those expert dignitaries was dispelled
 pakistan main aam logon ko bataaya ja rahaa he ki ye hamale bharat ne karwaae hai
 Today, India's faith got a shock when a Pakistani court released zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi, the accused in the Mumbai attack and Hafiz Saeed's right hand, on bail
 daleel thi kii lakhvi ke khilaaf pukhta saboot nahin hai
 It was Lakhvi who trained nine people including Ajmal Kasab and provided them arms and helped them reach Mumbai by sea
 isse pehle, varsh 2009 main lahore hoicourt ne hafiz said par lage mumbai hamale ke sabhi aarope kaarij kar use reeha kar diya tha, or dhyaan rahe, yah vahi hafiz said he, jise puri duniya ne 'most wonted tebrist' ghoshit kar rakhaa he, or jis par america ne lagbhag 60 karod rupee kaa inaam rakhaa hua he
 That Hafiz Saeed is also innocent for Pakistan
 bechaara bharat dogier par dogier bhejtaa rahaa, lekin ve shaayad pakistan kii court ke liye kaaphi nahin tha
 The Pakistan government runs a special train to propagate the same Hafiz Saeed against India
 or ab vahi hafiz said peshawar hamale kaa dosha bharat par madh rahaa he
 India had strongly condemned the school attack in Peshawar area of khyber Pakhtunkhwa
 yahaan kaa har ek vyakti pakistan ke peedit mata-pita ke dukh main shariq tha
 Indians have condemned the attack from mainstream media to social media, but Pakistan has a different scene
 vahaan ke zayd hamid jaise buddhijivi is hamale ko lekar bharat kii khufia agency 'ro' par shaq jataa rahe the
 Hafiz Saeed was repeatedly on TV blaming India and the Prime Minister of India for the attack, saying, "the rulers, the military and the people should all gather on this plot that we have to take revenge, and India, Whoever is responsible for this game has to take revenge
 
 
 ham puure taur par samajhate hai ki in sazishon ke peeche india he
 
 
 Today Modi, who sheds crocodile tears, calls Nawaz Sharif, is the real criminal
 
 
 iske jurm ko hamane pesh karnaa he
 
 
 " bechaare taharik-e-taliban vaale
 
 
 Public leaders like Hafiz Saeed are not giving credit to them, so they first told a spokesman that the Taliban had carried out the attack in return for the military operation 'zarb-e-azb' in North Waziristan, in which more than 1,800 The militants were shot down by the Pakistani army, and then defeated, and on Wednesday the pictures of the attackers were also released
 hafiz said itnaa bada aadmi nahin he ki bharat use jawaab de, lekin bharat main rahane vaale kuch logon, jo pakistan se aman kii aashaa rakhte hai, ko lag rahaa he ki pakistan main ab bharat ko lekar dharna badal rahi he
 Now the people there are with India
 sirf satta main baithe log, iesai, sena or aatankwaadi sanghathan hi bharat ke khilaaf hai
 Brother, what is left 
 
 ? agar janata ko bharat ke kareeb samajhate hai to agali line aapke vichaar badalane ke liye kaaphi he
 51 percent of Pakistani people consider India as the biggest threat
 yah baat america kii piu research centre ke may, 2014 ke survey se pataa chalaa he
 71 per cent of Pakistanis are not good about India
 sabase zyada gaur karne vaali baat is survey se nikalakar saamne ai he ki khaybar pakhtoonkhwaah ilaake ke 80 fisadi log bharat ko sabase bada khatra maanate hai
 This is the same area where over 150 school children were killed on Tuesday
 ab agar hafiz said vahaan ke logon ko bataa rahaa he ki bharat is hamale ke peeche he to kyon nahin peshawar ke log bharat kii sahanubhuti ko dhong samajhenge
 
 
 The bharat ko apana dushman na samajhane vaale kuch hi pakistani honge, jinhen anguliyon par gina ja saktaa he
 These would be people whose family relations are either related to Indians or whose economic interests are related to India
 pakistan ke chaaron praanton - punjab, sindh, khaybar pakhtoonkhwaah or baluchistan - ko agar kisi ek baat ne jod rakhaa he, to vah he bharat-virdohi niti, varanaa chaaron praanton main bhashaa, vichaaron or netritv ko lekar itani vibhinnataayen hai ki ve ab tak alag ho chuke hote or pakistan chaar chote-chote deshon main bant chukaa hota

" ” sambandhit police adhikariyon ko suspend karne kii maang puri nahin hui to aap sarkaar kaa ikbaal ghat saktaa he
 Vinod Kumar Binny, a party MLA from Laxminagar in Delhi, once again raised controversial voices on 15 January
 pehle mantri or baad main saansadi main jor aajamaane se vanchit kiye gaye binni ne aarope lagaae, ''arvind kejariwal party main taanaashaahee chalaate hai
 He claimed to hold a press conference the next day and disclose serious allegations
 ye aarope us din lage jab mana ja rahaa tha ki aap main tikat ke liye aavedan karne kii aakhri taarikh he
 The next day, Binny presented his allegations in front of reporters, but his allegations were more moral and emotional and less factual
 binni kehete hai, ''party main sabakuch puraane doston kii chaukadi yani kejariwal, (manish) sisodiya, (kumaar) vishwaas or sanjay singh hi tay karte hai
 Conflicting views are not heard
 ” binni ne kejariwal or shila dikshit ke saansad bete sandip dikshit ke enjio ke samay se kareebi dosti kii baat kahkar congress-aap kii santhganth ke aaropon ko bhi pukhta kar diya
 They also talk of corruption in ticket distribution and according to them, giving tickets to public opinion is not completely correct, because many candidates are already decided
 kunbe main ghamaasan:apano ne laga die taanaashaahee ke aropabinni kii ore se lagaae gaye aarope bhale hi kamjor the lekin bahut maamuli bahumat se dilli kii sarkaar chalaa rahi aap kii sehat ke liye kharaab sanket to de hi gaye
 First party leaders Sanjay Singh and Yogendra Yadav dismissed these allegations and later Kejriwal said, "there may be disagreement of ideas in the party, but no one will be allowed to be indiscipline
" binni par karrwai hogi
 "but the difficulty is that many mlas like Binny are upset with the party's style of functioning
 aap ke ek anya vidhayak surendra singh ne haalanki binni ke tareeke se asahmati jataai lekin unke ''mudde ko jaij” tehraaya
 But this is not the only case when Kejriwal had to come forward to clarify any issue related to his party rather than the government
 isse pehle unke dost, yuva kavi kumaar vishwaas kii puraani harakatein or nayaa dambh party ko dushwariyon main daal chukaa he
 Ever since Vishwas has been projected as a Lok Sabha candidate from Amethi against Rahul Gandhi, his tone has been heard loudly
 aise main virdohi partiyaan bhi unke khilaaf gade murde ukhaadie main lagi hai
 a video of Biswas was uploaded on youtube, in which he is allegedly making objectionable remarks on Muslim and Sikh society
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii tarif main manch se diya gaya unka ek kathith bayaan bhi party kii musiibat badha rahaa he
 In this 2009 video, he is openly wishing for Modi to sit on Delhi's throne
 haalanki vishwaas is par safai dete hai, ''kisi ke janm din par agar kavi ke naate kavita paath karne jaaoongaa to use gaali nahin diya ja saktaa
 Faith is being attributed to the resignation of senior poet Ashok Chakradhar from Delhi Sahitya Academy
 isi maahaul main party main shaamil huin saamaajik kaaryakarta mallika sarabhai ne vishwaas ko aparipakv qaraar de diya
 In response, Vishwas said to Talkhi, "who is this Mallika Sarabhai?" i do not know any Mallika Sarabhai
 ”yah kaisaa ittefaq he ki vishwaas kaa vaakya dilli kii mukhyamantri shila dikshit ke us aitihaasik vaakya se mail kha gaya, jisamen congress netaa ne aise hi dambh se kaha tha, ''ye kejariwal koun he?” itnaa hi nahin, vishwaas ek tivi intervyuu main yahaan tak kah chuke hai, ''main arvind se bada star hum, kejariwal or manish sisodiya ne mujhe andolan se isliye joda tha kyonki main apane saath yuvaaon ko jod saktaa hum
 When Arvind used to accompany me in IIT-IIM, a crowd of youths surrounded me for my autograph and Arvind was left behind alone, but today people surround Arvind and i am elbowed in the crowd
 ” haalanki vishwaas yah bhi jodate hai ki isse koi fark nahin padataa
 When the Kejriwal government decided to give 20,000 liters of water per month for free, the presence of trust in the press conference with the CEO of the Jal Board was exactly the same as the feeling of extra-constitutional power, for which the Congress is criticized
 vivaadon kaa pitara:ati sakriyata bani ji kaa janjaal''raajnneeti keechad he or usamen ghuskar hi is gandagi ko saaf kiya ja saktaa he
 "with this stubbornness, when Kejriwal proposed to go ahead of the Jan Lokpal movement in front of Anna Hazare, Anna refused, but Kejriwal remained firm on his decision
 aakhirkaar kejariwal kii jid ne dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav main itihaas rach diya, lekin andolan or sarkaar chalaane kaa fark unhen samaj aane laga he
 In Delhi, AAP government is seen gasping in just 20 days
 kejariwal sarkaar ke kanoon mantri somnath bharti pakhwaade bhar main hi vivaadon kii hetric laga chuke hai
 Confrontation with his secretary on the issue of convening a meeting of judges in Delhi, and court comments in the case of influencing a witness in a corruption case, led to the demand for his resignation
 bharti ne dilli main danish balaatkaar peedita kaa naam saarvajanik kar diya, jiske liye unhen maafee maangani padi
 Health Minister Satyendar Jain's insensitivity has been expressed in the issue of throwing a newborn baby's body in the trash after he refused to intervene, calling it a private hospital case
 baad main kejariwal ne hastkshep kiya
 Now due to Bharti, the government's confrontation with Delhi Police has increased so much that Kejriwal is planning a sit-in outside the Home Ministry
 agar aisa hua to rajya banaam centre kii ladaai sangheey vyavastha ke liye behad khatarnaak hogi
 Women and Child Development Minister Rakhi Birla exaggerated the car's glass crackling as an attack on her, while the child and her mother apologized to Birla at the same time
 iske baavjood raakhi ke bartaav se khaufjada baccha or parivaar apana ghar chhodkar chalaa gaya
 Here too the Chief Minister had to interfere and the family returned to their homes
 aap netaa prashanth bhushan ne kashmir par janamat sangrah kii baat kahkar bavaal khadaa kar diya to aap ko khud ko bhushan ke bayaan se kinare karnaa padaa
 But the matter caught fire when activists of an anonymous Hindu organization 'hindu Raksha Dal' attacked the party's Ghaziabad office
 uske baad kejariwal ne bhavuk bayaan diya, ''agar mujhe or prashanth ko katl karne se kashmir mudde kaa hal nikalataa ho to aap jahaan kahen, ham marane ke liye aa jaaenge
 "team Kejriwal made headlines by riding the metro for the pledge, then the next day many ministers reached the secretariat by public transport auto, metro
 lekin 24 ghante main hi mantri viypi numberon vaali inova gaadi istemaal karne lage
 Whereas AAP in its manifesto spoke of ending VIP culture
 har haath main bataasha:siyasat ke chakkar main, muftakhori ko badhawaparty ke liye sabase badi chunauti vaadon ko puraa karne ke liye uthaae gaye tej kadam hai
 The decision to provide free water and cheap electricity raised the question whether AAP is taking the country back to the subsidy era
 isse bhi badi baat yah he ki jin ilaakon main pani nahin aa rahaa he, yaa jahaan saaf pani muhaiyaa nahin he, un ilaakon ko is tarah ke faislon se kya hasil hoga?sarkaar ne pani or bijli supplai ke buniyadi tantra main badlaav ko lekar apni kisi manshaa kaa khulaasa ab tak nahin kiya, jabaki party ke ghoshnaptr main is tarah ke buniyadi badlaav kii baaten badi pramukhataa se likhi gayi thim
 This free politics is taking place at a time when both central parties agree on liberalization and reduction of subsidy, then this honest party should declare its economic policy before taking such decisions
 party ko epadi ke mudde par bhi nitigat chunauti badhati jaaegi kyonki ye ab gharelu mudde nahin rah gaye hai
 The country has been entering into many international agreements on these subjects
 desh main teesri rashtriya party ke taur par ubharne kaa sapana paalane vaali aap ko ab apane nitigat pattey kholane hi padenge
 No matter how busy its leaders are in handling themselves, managing Delhi and fighting the Lok Sabha battle
 agar aise muddon par zyada bhram kii sthiti bani rahi to bahut sambhav he ki party kaa us madhyam varg main samarthan ghatane lage, jo is samay party kaa divaana he
 Meanwhile, questions have also been raised on the way Arvind Kejriwal is running the government
 ramlila maidan main 28 disambar ko shapath grahan ke baad unhone do din ke bheetar bhrashtachar se ladgaye ke liye ek helpline number dene kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin is par amal karne main unhen hafte bhar se zyada kaa samay lag gaya
 Even after this, when the helpline was released, the people of Delhi started feeling cheated and in the eyes of the legalists, it is such a weapon that the common man will get entangled in the courts
 yani jis pareshaani se bachane ke liye log rishwat dene ko majaboor the, ab us rishwat se bachane ke liye pehle se zyada kanoonee adchane jhelni padengi
 The party also strongly publicized the decision to hold the Janata Darbar, but there was a lot of chaos in the Janata Darbar on the first day
 agle din hi kejariwal sarkaar ke paseene chhot gaye or elaan kar diya gaya ki ab sarkaar koi janata darbar nahin lagaaegi
 This again gave AAP critics a chance
 kagress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne chutki lee,''1994 main main jab madhya pradesh kaa mukhyamantri tha to hafte main chah din do ghante roj aam logon se miltaa tha
 Sheila Dixit also adopted this system for 15 years as the Chief Minister of Delhi
 arvind kejariwal ko shila dikshit se sabak lenaa chahie
 "the burden of ambitions: made such high promises that even after becoming a difficult government, the leaders of AAP are not ready to understand that the depressive phase of the struggle has been left behind and the crown of power is on its head, whose thorns can be seen by others Do not come, but definitely wears the wearer
 kejariwal or unke mantri kai muddon par is tarah laachaari or bebasii kaa izhaar kar rahe hai, jaise unhen pehle se pataa na rahaa ho ki dilli aisi hi he
 They are hurt over not listening to them in the central government departments more than fixing their departments
 ve chaahate hai ki dilli kaa sara sarkari mahakama unke party kaaryakartaaon kii tarah jazbe se kaam karne lage
 But no one knows when this change will happen and the Lok Sabha elections are from the top
 isliye kejariwal sarkari mashinari kii bajaay party sanghathan ke bal par sarkaar chalaanaa chaahate hai
 Not a single of his announcements went public from the public relations department of the party, instead of reaching out to the public relations department of Delhi government
 yahaan tak ki bhrashtachar shikaayat helpline kaa number bhi sarkaar kii aadhikarik website par kahin pramukhataa se najar nahin aata
 His good wishes, the traditional thinking of the people and the Nizam of red tape could not be taken with him
 balaatkaar peedit nirbhaya ke mudde par puri dilli ko sir par uthaa lene vaali aap ke mukhiya ko samaj hi nahin aa rahaa ki ve dilli ke takht par baithe hai, lekin is duraachaar ko roak nahin paa rahe
 To this, Congress leader Arvinder Singh Lovely said, "in such a case, why is the Aam Aadmi Party raising the sky against our government now?" Now the team is expressing helplessness by arguing that Kejriwal Police is not under Delhi government
 jis metro se baithkar ve shapath lene ramlila maidan gaye the, usee metro ke karmchaaree unke ghar par pahunchakar naukari pakki karne kaa andolan karne lage or ve kuch nahin kar paae
 The mountain of his promises is now becoming a public flood and is hitting the streets at the Delhi Secretariat
 sarkaar kaa pehla pakhwada agar lok lubhaavan ghoshnaaon par nyochaavar hua to doosraa haftaa vivaadon par spashtikaran kii najar hota dikhaa
 The search for a house for them has become an interesting story in itself
 ummiido kii sawari khatarnaak hoti he
 Dangerous like riding a lion
 aap jab ummiido kii lahar par savaar hote hai to aapako mahabali hone kaa ehsaas hota he lekin aap sher kii peeth se yaa ummiido kii lahar se utar nahin sakate
 It can be deadly
 aap or uske netaa kejariwal ko yah baat do hafte main hi samaj aa gai hogi
 If they live up to the expectations of the public, which is possible, they can affect the 2014 Lok Sabha election results
 agar ve vifal rahe to uskaa nateeja aap ke saath hi bhartiya raajnneeti ke liye bhi bura sabit hoga kyonki ummid or sapanom kii maut se bura kuch bhi nahin hota
 The DMK has categorically ruled out an alliance with the Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 diemke ne spasht kiya ki usne sirf rajyasabha chunaav ke liye congress kaa samarthan maanga tha
 Senior DMK leader and party treasurer MK Stalin said last night, 'seeking the support of the party for the post of Rajya Sabha member does not mean that we have come back with him again
 agle loksabhaa chunaav ke liye congress ke saath hamaara koi gathbandhan nahin hoga
 Stalin said, "we came out of the UPA because of differences over the issue of Sri Lankan Tamils
" yah matbhed abhi bhi kaayam he
 He also ruled out the possibility of an alliance with the Congress either in the Lok Sabha elections or Assembly elections
 centre main nauveen loksabhaa ke baad (varsh 1989) pehali baar 2014 main kisi party ko akele bahumat se zyada siten milin or bhartiya janata party satta main ai
 Along with all the policies of the government, its effect was also seen in foreign policy
 centre sarkaar ke mukhiya piem narendra modi bharat kii videsh niti ke pramukh nirdharak ke taur par saamne aae
 He also developed personal relationships with heads of state around the world
 is dauraan bharat kii videsh niti pados main taqatvar china ko saadhane main, dakshin asian ilaake main shanti kaayam rakhane or saajha saanskrithik viraasat vaale deshon ko saath laane par rahi
 India has got the fortune of smaller neighboring countries, although it has also been competing with China
 piem modi ne gaddi sambhalate hi saarc raashtra pramukhon ko apane shapath grahan main bulaayaa, lagbhag sabhi padosi deshon kaa daura kiya or 'nebarhud first kaa naaraa diya
 PM Modi has completed four years in power and there have been no coalition compulsions like previous governments
 aise main jaanate hai ki in chaar saalon main bharat ne apane padosi deshon se kaise sambandh viksit kiye-1- maldivasyah bharat kaa ekmaatr padosi desh he jahaan modi nahin gaye
 In 2015, Modi was to pass through here, but his tour was postponed due to political turmoil
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj jarur 2014 or 2015 main yahaan gayi
 In 2016, Abdullah Yameen, the President of Maldives, came to India and the two countries reached agreements in the fields of defense, taxation, tourism and space research
 beete saalon main maldives main china kaa dakhal badha he
 In 2011, China opened its embassy in Male
 disambar 2017 main maldive ne bina vipakshi saansadon kii maujuudagi ke aadhi raat main china ke saath vivaadit 'free trade agreement' (FTA) paarit kiya
 China has only FTA with Pakistan apart from Maldives in South Asia
 yahaan se maldives bharat ke bajaae china ke kareeb gaya
 India expressed concern over this development
 iske baad to donon deshon ke sambandh or kharaab ho gaye
 The Maldives also suspended three of their local councilors who met the Indian ambassador without prior permission
 donon deshon ke rishton main aisa pehali baar dekhne ko mila
 2- Bhutan India has greatly helped this Himalayan neighboring nation
 kam sansadhano vaale deshon main se ek bhutan main bharat ne telecommunication or hydro-electric project ke saath hi aspataal, sadaken or pul banane main bhi madad kii he
 India has not got any headache from this country
 narendra modi ne piem banane ke baad pehla daura bhutan kaa hi kiya tha
 After this, Bhutan's PM Tshering Togbe visited India in January 2015
 haalanki is desh ke saath bharat ke sambandh 2017 main ahm mode par aa gaye jab bharat-china-bhutan kii seemaa par doklam main teenon senaaon ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 In this dispute, Bhutan first ignored India, while India said that its soldiers had gone to Doklam to help the Bhutanese soldiers
 yah china ke anuroop bayaan tha, kyonki china kahata rahaa he ki doklam main bharat kaa koi role nahin banataa he
 However, in a second statement about three months later, Bhutan considered India to be part of the dispute
 yah kootnithik taur par bharat ke liye raahat bharaa kadam tha
 3- There has been a tussle between India and China for Myanmar Myanmar's friendship
 myanmar main 50 lakh chini or kareeb 4 lakh bhartiya mul ke log rahete hai
 During military rule, China was Myanmar's only friend worldwide
 myanmar main kul videshi nivesh kaa ek tihaai china ne kiya he
 Also myanmar-china trade is three times more than myanmar-india trade
 myanmar kii koshish rahi he ki vah donon deshon se achche sambandh banaae rakhe
 Recently there was a dispute between Myanmar and Bangladesh about the Rohingya refugees
 myanmar main based rohingya musalamaanon ke khilaaf vahaan kii sena ne aakraamak abhiyaan chalaaya, jisaki duniya bhar main ninda hui or is desh par pratibandh bhi lage
 In settling the dispute, China won and gave a three-point reconciliation formula
 modi ne sitambar 2017 main myanmar kii yatra kii thi or bharat ke paas is vivaad ko sulajhaakar agua banane kaa mauka tha
 But India remained silent for fear of Myanmar being angry
 duusari ore endie sarkaar ne ise dharmik rang bhi de diya
 When Bangladesh expressed disappointment over India's stand, India launched a 'operation Insaniyat' campaign to help these refugees, but by then it was late
 bharat na to bangladesh ko saadh paaya or na hi myanmar ko
 4- bangladeshjuly 2014 India and Bangladesh acceded to the decision of 'international Tribunal of the Law of the Sea' and settled the water dispute
 june 2015 main modi bangladesh gaye or donon deshon ke bich jamini seemaa samjhauta hua or donon deshon ke bich bas sevaayen shuru karne par bhi sahmati bani
 In April 2017, Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina visited India and India for development works with additional $ 500 million for the purchase of defense equipment to Bangladesh 4
 5 arab dollar kii nai credit line kii ghoshnaa kii
 In Bangladesh, the threat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations has increased in the past
 isse donon desh aatankarodhi ranneeti par saath khadey najar aae hai
 Bangladesh is also the medium of campaigns in this area such as India's 'bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation' (BIMSTEC) and 'bangladesh-bhutan-india-nepal' (BBIN)
 in sabake baavjood donon deshon ke bich tista jal samjhauta nahin ho sakaa he
 Both countries agree on this, but West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has objections
 bangladesh main is saal ke ant tak aam chunaav hone hai or shaikh hasina ise lagu karwaanaa chahengi
 Bangladesh expressed its displeasure with India for not standing against Myanmar over the Rohingya refugees issue
 haalanki bharat ne baad main sharnaarthiyon ke liye madad muhaiyaa karai
 5- Sri Lankan Sri Lanka is India's largest trading partner in South Asia
 haalanki, bharat ke is padosi ke bhi haal main china se sambandh pragadh hue hai
 The reason is that when Western countries accused former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa of human rights violations in the last conflict with the LTTE, China loaned him billions of dollars and built it there and overcome Sri Lanka with financial difficulties
 haalanki, srilanka main maitreepala sirisena ke raashtrapati banane ke baad yah desh bharat ke kareeb aayaa he
 Sirisena visited India in 2015, soon after taking over the throne
 march 2015 main hi bhartiya piem 28 saalon baad srilanka jane vaale piem bane or vahaan kii sansad ko bhi sambodhit kiya
 In May 2017, Modi again visited Sri Lanka
 may 2017 main srilanka ke piem ranil vikramsinghe china ke 'belt and road initiative' (BRI) sammelan main hissaa lene pahunche or unke desh ko 24 arab dollar kaa atirikt lone mila
 Subsequently, in December 2017, Sri Lanka leased the port of Hambantota to China for 99 years
 is bandargah kaa biarai main ahm role ho saktaa he
 Following India's concerns, Sri Lanka assured in 2018 that the port would not be used for military activities
 iske alaava srilanka kii ore se hambantota main bharatiyon ko nivesh kaa nyotaa bhi diya gaya
 If this happens, it will make it easier for India to keep an eye on China
 6- nepalanepal ke saath bharat ke rishte achche rahe hai
 PM Modi went to Nepal in 2014 and raised $ 1 billion in credit line for hydropower and infrastructure
 unke daure par paryaton, dawaai ke kshetra main samjhaute hue or janakapur-ayodhya bas seva par sahmati bani jo modi ke 2018 main haalia daure par shuru bhi ho gai
 After the 2015 earthquake, India helped Nepal and announced a $ 750 million credit line
 is tarah modi ke aane ke baad donon deshon ke bich shuruaati sambandh achche rahe
 The relations between the two countries soured after the Madheshis were ignored in the Terai region after the creation of a new constitution in Nepal
 virodh kar rahe madheshiyon ne bharat se nepal jane vaala vyapaarik maarg band kar diya
 Nepal accused India of undeclared economic blockade
 may 2016 main nepal ne raashtrapati bidyadevi bhandari kaa daura radd kar apane rajdoot ko bhi waapas bulaayaa
 Here the relationship of the two countries reached a low level
 iske baad modi isi maheene nepal gaye or vahaan ke mandir main puja kii
 However, after the Left Front victory in Nepal, the challenge before India is how to prevent Nepal from moving closer to China
 bharat ko nepal kii raajnneeti menaae yuva rajanetaaon ko bhi sadhana he
 China is trying to exploit this opportunity
 nepal bhi china ke 'belt and road initiative' (BRI) plan main shaamil he
 7
 Afghanistan has been successful in improving relations with Afghanistan
 sitambar 2014 main ashraf gani ke raashtrapati banane ke baad vah april 2015 main bharat aae
 After this Modi went to Afghanistan in December 2015
 bharat ne afghanistan ko taliban se nipatane ke liye chital helicopter die, vahaan kii sansad ke nirmaan main madad kii, dil kii beemaari se peedit afgani bacchon ke liye 50 lakh dollar kaa raahat kosh banaaya or 'indian council for cultural relations' (ICCR) scolership ko bhi 2020 tak badhaayaa
 In June 2016, Modi again went to Afghanistan, during which India gave a loan of $ 2 billion to rebuild the neighboring country
 yah afghanistan ne padosi deshon kii ore se sabase zyada he
 Both countries tried to improve transport connectivity to the Chabahar port of Iran
 pakistan vyapaar ke liye apane yahaan se rasta dene se inkaar karata rahaa he
 After Chabahar, contact with Iran will also improve
 afghanistan ne pakistan ko dhamkee bhi di thi ki agar use wagha-ataari se bharat ke saath vyapaar karne nahin diya gaya to vah pakistan kaa central asia se sampark kaat degaa
 India is trying to reduce the impact of the sino-pak alliance by accessing roads and railways in Central Asia through Afghanistan
 bharat ne oktober 2017 main chabahaar ke jariye afghanistan main gehun kii khep bhi pahunchaai
 In addition, india-afghanistan launched the 'air Freight Corridor' in June 2017 and another corridor by December
 yah donon deshon ke bich vyapaar ke alaava logon ke avaagaman kaa bhi madhyam banegaa
 India, along with the United States, is also striving to bring peace to Afghanistan
 8- pakistanbharat or pakistan ke sambandh2008 mumbai hamalon ke baad se hi kharaab hai
 However, PM Modi tried his best to improve these relations
 paak piem navaj sharif modi ke shapath grahan main bharat aae
 After this, in December 2015, while returning from Afghanistan, Modi suddenly went to Lahore and met PM Nawaz Sharif
 haalanki, janvari 2016 main pathankot airbase par aatanki hamale or iesai ko isaki jaanch ke liye desh main bulaane se modi sarkaar vivaadon main ghir gai
 Relations deteriorated further in September 2016 after the terrorist attack on an army base in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir
 donon deshon ke bich rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ke str kii baatcheet bhi band ho gai
 Both countries have accused each other of ceasefire violations
 udi hamale ke turant baad sitambar 2016 membharat ne pakistan kii jameen parmaujuud aatanki campon par sargical strike bhi kii
 In it, India claimed to have killed about 40 terrorists
 haalanki, pakistan isse inkaar karata rahaa
 During this period, India's strategy to isolate Pakistan was somewhat successful
 america ne pakistan ko di jane vaali sainya madad roki to hafiz said ke raajnneeti main aane kaa bharat kaa virodh rang nahin laa sakaa
 Pakistan joined China, Russia and Iran during this period
 pakistan is beechbharat ke dost rus kshapani ore khinchne main safal rahaa
 Both came together on many issues
 roosi sena ne pehali baar pakistani sena ke saath abhyaas bhi kiya
 Relations between the two countries are still poor
 bharat duusare deshon ke hastkshep kaa lagaataar virodh karata aayaa he
 Cricket ties between the two countries could not be restored
 9- chinapakistan ke alaava china hi bharat kii videsh niti kaa pramukh nirdharak tatv rahaa he
 From China itself, India has been challenged in the neighborhood and around the world
 china apane 'belt and road initiative' (BRI) ke jariye bharat ke padosi deshon main ahm nirmaan kar rahaa he
 India did not accept connecting with China's 'one Belt One Road', as the project called 'china-pakistan Economic Corridor' is going through POK
 bharat ko china kii is koshish sealag-thalag padane or china se sahyogi deshon se ghirne kii chintaa he
 The move of China closer to Pakistan is also a matter of concern for India
 china kii koshish he ki pakistan, nepal or maldives main vah apni maujuudagi darj karaae or bhutan ke saath sambandh sudhaarney kii koshish main he
 During these four years Xi Jinping visited India, Modi recently made an informal visit to China
 seemaa vivaad ko lekar doklam main donon deshon ke bich tanaav bana rahaa
 Relations between India and China continued to deteriorate over the Dalai Lama
 haal hi main bharat ne china kii aapatti par dalai lamas ke ek kaarykram ko himachal pradesh shift kiya tha or usamen kendriya sarkaar ke ahm mantriyon ne hissaa bhi nahin liya
 However, India was again forced to face China in the United Nations
 disambar 2016 main bharat pakistan sthit jaish-e-mohammad ke mukhiya masood ajahar ko vaishvik aatanki ghoshit karnaa chahta tha
 China's veto in the UN could not happen
 china ourbharat ke bich pratidwandvitamein inaki arthvyavastha kaa ahm role he
 China's economy is five times that of India, so India cannot match it in terms of financial assistance to neighboring countries
 aise main use behatar kootnithik raste talashne honge

 pakistan dwaara bhartiya javaanon ke shav kshat-vikshat karne va kashmir ghati main patharbaajon ke khilaaf bajrang dal ne mangalvaar ko deshbhar main pradarshan kiya or raashtrapati ko gyaapan saunpa
 Bajrang Dal expressed his displeasure at the stone-pelting being carried out in the Kashmir Valley by demonstrations across the country
 bajrang dal ne pakistan dwaara hamaare javaanon ke shavo ke saath mendhar main jo dvyavahaar kiya gaya he, usko lekar bhi aakrosh tha
 The Bajrang Dal staged a nationwide protest against the persistent attacks on the security hair of the stone-pelters and their supporters sheltering them in the Kashmir valley
 desh ke lagbhag har jile main hue in virodh pradarshnon main bajrang dal ke saath vishwa hindu parishad ke logon ne bhi hissaa liya
 a memorandum was also given to President Pranab Mukherjee
 jantar mantar par pradarshan ke dauraan bajrang dal ke sanyojak manoj verma ne kaha ki kashmir main hamaare javaanon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 There is a lot of resentment towards him
 bajrang dal kaa kahana he ki pakistan pryojit aatankwaadi,unhen cover dene vaale patharbaj tathaa unke samarthak tathaa-kathith maanavadhikaaravaadi sabhi mili hue he
 All these should be treated the same
 hamaare surakshabalon par hamalaa karne vaale kisi bhi vyakti yaa sanghathan ko bajrangdal ek hi drushti se dekhtaa he
 Paying tribute to the martyrs of Sukma in Chhattisgarh and Kashmir Valley, the Bajrangdal chief said that enough is enough
 desh kaa naujabaan sirf prati-uttar kii pratiksha main he
 He demanded that not all these countries have spoken, they only understand the language of the bullet
 ab pathar kaa jabaab goli se diya janaa aavashyak he
 During the demonstrations across the country, the Bajrang Dal used to say that Pakistan has done a cowardly act with Indian soldiers
 usase puure desh main gussa he or bharat ke janamanas main bahut bechaini he
 The workers of Bajrangdal are ready to surrender to any extent to protect the honor of security hair
 vaktaaon kaa kahana tha ki sena kaa apmaan is desh ke nagarikon apmaan he
 Therefore, the army and paramilitary hair should be allowed to take open action against these stone-bearers like terrorists
 gyaapan main kaha gaya he ki sena hamaare jan gana man kaa gaurav he tathaa rashtriya asmita kii sangrakshak he
 The entire nation feels insulted by its insult
 ghati ke in patharbarjon ke saath unke samarthakon ke viruddh bhi kathor kaarywahi ke saath sena ko inase nipatane main chhut pradaan kiya jaae taaki ghati main or rashtradroh janm na le sake
 An emergency meeting of the State IAS Association took place in Patna on Sunday following the arrest of Bihar State Staff Selection Commission Chairman and senior IAS officer Sudhir Kumar in the paper leak case
 baithak main kai faisle kiye gaye or ek prastaav bhi paarit kiya gaya
 After that, a team of IAS officers have met the Governor and submitted a memorandum to them requesting that they do not trust police investigation against senior IAS officer Sudhir Kumar, hence the CBI should be investigated
 baithak main paarit prastaav ke anusaar kisi bhi prakaar kaa maukhik aadesh nahin lene kaa faisla kiya gaya, yahaan tak ki mukhyamantri karyaalay se bhi likhit main hi aadesh liye jaaen
 The proposal also said that the members of the association would neither assume the post of the chairman of the Staff Selection Commission nor the Controller of Examinations or the head of any recruitment board
 yahaan tak ki sudhir kumaar ke maamle main unki turant rihaai ke liye jo bhi kanoonee kharch aayega vah bhi association hi vahan karegaa
 And when their demands are not met then they will also tie a black band on their hands
 prashnptr li maamle main giraftaar bihar rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog ke adhyaksh sudhir kumaar filhal patna kii phulwari jail main hai
 In recent times, the State Police has arrested a senior officer for the first time and this is the first time that the State IAS Association and the Chief Minister are face to face
 rajyapal se baithak ke baad association ke sachiv vivek singh ne kaha ki police jaanch main kya tathy hai uske bare main unhen nahin pataa lekin rajya sarkaar or police ko sudhir kumaar ke khilaaf sabooton par itnaa bharosa he tab sibiai jaanch kara le, doodh kaa doodh pani kaa pani ho jayega
 Earlier, an emergency meeting of the State IAS Association was held in Patna on Sunday and after that IAS officers made a human chain in front of the Raj Bhavan
 ye haal ke varshon main pehali baar tha ki rajya ke iees adhikari rajya sarkaar yaa kahen police ke khilaaf sadakon par utre the
 Earlier, after the arrest of Sudhir Kumar, a delegation had also met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and told him in two words that if officers are sent to jail for conducting the examination then no officer should refrain from conducting the examination in the coming days Would like isse shaayad hi rajya main koi niyukti ho paaegi
 According to experts, Nitish Kumar was also shocked to see the attitude of the IAS officers and he had also hijacked an officer to get very excited later
 tippaniyan But state IAS officers say that Nitish Kumar has a double attitude towards officers
 agar shankaa hone par sudhir kumaar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya, to pichley saal ke bahucharchit medha ghotaale main tatkaaleen shiksha vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv dharmendra singh gangavar ke khilaaf karrwai to chhodie, patna police ne poochtacha karne kii himmat tak nahin jutai
 While the District Magistrate of Vaishali has written in the file that the examination center was changed on the orders of Gangwar
 sudhir kumaar ke bachaab main iees adhikariyon kii daleel he ki unki chhavi saaf-suthere afasar kii rahi he or unke khilaaf badale kii bhaavana ke tahat karrwai kii gai he
 Former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has alleged that Sudhir Kumar, the father-in-law of Nitish Kumar's Principal Secretary Chanchal Kumar was sent to jail earlier, is being avenged
 iske alaava patna police dwaara gathit vishesh jaanch dal ke mukhiya manu maharaj ke samay main patna main do haadase hue, lekin nitish kumaar ne kabhi unke khilaaf karrwai nahin kii
 Apart from this, the Leader of Opposition Sushil Modi has also alleged about the investigator of the case, Rakesh Dubey, that Nitish Kumar never gave any important post till the time he was in BJP government due to his controversial background
 haalanki patna police kaa kahana he ki sudhir kumaar ke khilaaf karrwai khaskar giraftaar ke pehle pukhta saboot ikattha hone ke baad hi itnaa bada kadam uthaaya gaya he or rajya iees association bina matlab kaa til kaa taar bana rahaa he
 Sudhir never cooperated during the interrogation, but the family left Patna without informing after the involvement of the followers
 vahiin nitish kumaar ke kareebi log bataate hai ki unke shasankaal main na kisi ko bachaaya gaya he, na kisi ko fansaaya gaya hai
 But of course, this whole development is a big shock for Nitish Kumar during his more than 11 years of rule
 prashnptr li maamle main giraftaar bihar rajya karmchaaree chayan ayog ke adhyaksh sudhir kumaar filhal patna kii phulwari jail main hai

 But of course, this whole development is a big shock for Nitish Kumar during his more than 11 years of rule
 iske pehle rajya iees association kii apaat baithak ravivaar ko patna main hui or uske baad rajbhavan ke saamne iees adhikariyon ne maanav shrinkhalaa banaai
 This was the first time in recent years that IAS officers of the state took to the streets against the state government or, say, the police
 iske pehle sudhir kumaar kii giraftaari ke baad ek pratinidhimandal ne bhi mukhyamantri nitish kumaar se mulaakaat kii thi or unhen do took shabdon main kaha tha ki agar pariksha karaane ke liye adhikariyon ko jail bheja jaayegaa tab aane vaale dinon main koi bhi adhikari pariksha karaane se bachanaa chahega
 This will hardly make any appointment in the state
 jaankaron ke anusaar nitish kumaar bhi iees adhikariyon ke tevar dekhakar hatprabh the or unhone ek adhikari ko baad main kaaphi utejit hone ke liye tokaa bhi tha
 The comments lekin rajya ke iees afasaron kaa kahana he ki nitish kumaar kaa adhikariyon ke prati doharaa ravaiya hota he
 If Sudhir Kumar was arrested on suspicion, then spare the action against the then Education Department Principal Secretary Dharmendra Singh Gangwar in last year's famous merit scam, Patna Police did not even dare to inquire
 jabaki vaishali ke jiladhikari ne file main likhaa he ki gangavar ke aadesh par hi pariksha centre badla gaya
 Sudhir Kumar's Icon officers argue that his image is of a clean officer and action has been taken against him in retaliation
 purv mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi ne aarope lagaaya he ki nitish kumaar ke pradhan sachiv chanchal kumaar ke sasur ko sudhir kumaar ne pehle jail bheja tha, usee kaa badla liya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, there were two accidents in Patna during the time of Manu Maharaj, the head of Special Investigation Team constituted by Patna Police, but Nitish Kumar never took action against him
 iske alaava maamle ke jaanchakarta rakesh dube ke bare main bhi vipaksh ke netaa susheel modi aarope laga chuke hai ki unki vivaadaaspad prishthbhumi ke kaaran jab tak bijepi sarkaar main shaamil thi nitish kumaar ne kabhi koi mahatvaurna pad nahin diya
 However, the Patna Police say that such a big step has been taken against Sudhir Kumar, especially after strong evidence has been gathered before the arrest and the State IAS Association is making a mole of meaningless
 sudhir ne poochtacha ke dauraan na kabhi sahyog kiya, balki parivaar waalo kii sanliptata ke baad bina bataae patna se chale gaye
 At the same time, people close to Nitish Kumar tell that during his reign no one has been saved, nor has anyone been implicated
 lekin nishchit rup se nitish kumaar ke 11 varshon se adhik ke shasankaal main ye puraa ghatnakram unke liye bada dhakka he
 But state IAS officers say that Nitish Kumar has a double attitude towards officers
 agar shankaa hone par sudhir kumaar ko giraftaar kar liya gaya, to pichley saal ke bahucharchit medha ghotaale main tatkaaleen shiksha vibhaag ke pradhan sachiv dharmendra singh gangavar ke khilaaf karrwai to chhodie, patna police ne poochtacha karne kii himmat tak nahin jutai

 Sudhir never cooperated during the interrogation, but the family left Patna without informing after the involvement of the followers

 anil kumble ke team india ke coach ke pad se istifa dene ke baad uthaa vivaad shant hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Kumble in a tweet, stating the reason for his resignation, had admitted to having estranged from Kohli
 udhar, anil kumble ke istife ke baad team india main coach or captain ke kad or uske role ko lekar bahes tej ho gai he
 However, this issue is not new for Indian cricket
 isse pehle greg chapel-ganguli ke alaava jon rhite or team (virendra sahvaag or jahir khan jaise khilaadi) ke bich hue vivaadon kii yaaden bhi taaja ho gai hai
 Talking exclusively to NDTV, former captain Sunil Gavaskar said that maybe it could also be that the way Anil Kumble showed his attitude towards raising match fees, the board may be angry with him
 lekin mudda yahi he ki cricket salaahkaar samiti ne agar kumble se kaha he ki captain ko aapse samasya to yah bahut hi niraashajanak he
 If the board feels that the captain is the boss then the coach is not needed
 unhone sawaal uthaaya ki salaahkaar samiti ke sujhaavon kii kya ahmiyat he
 He said that the credit for preparing the team goes to the coach
 aise main kumble ke kaam kii shikaayat nahin kii ja sakati
 He said that if the problem related to Kumble is detailed, it will be better for Team India and cricket so that these mistakes cannot be repeated in the future
 tippaniyan On the question of the foreign coach, he said that the players want the coach to play less
 khilaadi kam anubhav vaale khilaadiyon ko coach ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Describing Kumble's resignation as an insult, former captain Gavaskar said that if this is the case then no senior player would want to become the coach of Team India
 NDTV se khaas baat karte hue purv captain sunil gavaskar ne kaha ki shaayad yah bhi ho saktaa he ki anil kumble ne jis tarah se match fees badhaane ke lekar apana rukh dikhaaya, usase ho saktaa he ki board usase naaraaz ho
 But the point is that if the Cricket Advisory Committee has told Kumble that the captain has problems with you then it is very disappointing
 board ko agar lagata he ki captain hi bos he to coach kii jarurat nahin he
 He questioned the importance of the suggestions of the Advisory Committee
 unhone kaha ki team ko taiyaar karne kaa shrey coach ko jaataa he
 In such a situation, one cannot complain about Kumble's work
 unhone kaha ki agar kumble se judi samasya ko viraat vistaar se bataaen to team india or cricket ke liye behatar rahegaa taaki aane vaale bhavishya main in galatiyon ko na doharaaya ja sake
 The comments videshi coach ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki khilaadi kam khilne vaala coach chaahate hai
 Players want to see players with less experience as coaches
 kumble ke istife ko apmaan qaraar dete hue purv captain gavaskar ne kaha ki agar yahi haal rahaa to koi bhi varisht khilaadi team india kaa coach nahin bananaa chahega
 He said that the credit for preparing the team goes to the coach
 aise main kumble ke kaam kii shikaayat nahin kii ja sakati
 He said that if the problem related to Kumble is detailed, it will be better for Team India and cricket so that these mistakes cannot be repeated in the future
 tippaniyan On the question of the foreign coach, he said that the players want the coach to play less
 khilaadi kam anubhav vaale khilaadiyon ko coach ke rup main dekhnaa chaahate hai

 videshi coach ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki khilaadi kam khilne vaala coach chaahate hai
 Players want to see players with less experience as coaches
 kumble ke istife ko apmaan qaraar dete hue purv captain gavaskar ne kaha ki agar yahi haal rahaa to koi bhi varisht khilaadi team india kaa coach nahin bananaa chahega

 karnataka kii siyaasi jang ko fatah karne or bijepi ko patkhni dene ke liye siddharmaiya piem narendra modi ke daanv ko hi aajamaane main jute hai
 In the 2014 elections, Narendra Modi eliminated the opposition by contesting from Vadodara in Gujarat and Varanasi seat of UP
 siddharmaiya bhi modi kii tarj par karnataka ke vidhansabha chunaav main do siton se chunavi maidan main utre hai
 Now it has to be seen whether Siddaramaiah is able to defeat the BJP with Modi's bets or himself becomes a victim of this chakravyuh? In 2014, Modi fought from two seats
 At the same time, the biggest bet was to make Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state
 iskaa nateeja rahaa ki gujarat kii sabhi 26 loksabhaa siten bijepi ke khate main ai thim, saath hi upi main bijepi ne 80 loksabhaa siton main se 71 par jeet darj karke itihaas rachaa tha
 While two seats were won by bjp's ally Apna Dal, which together the NDA won 73 seats in the state
 siddharmaiya ke do seat par ladane ke peeche kaa ganitamodi ke isi daanv ko karnataka ke mukhyamantri siddharmaiya vidhansabha chunaav main aajamaa rahe hai
 He has contested from Chamundeshwari, the assembly seat in South Karnataka and from Badami assembly seat in North Karnataka
 bijepi ise siddharmaiya ke haar kaa dar bataa rahi he
 Whereas the Congress has a well-planned strategy of taking Siddaramaiah from the two seats and contesting both the North and South regions simultaneously
 siddharmaiya ne kiya palatvarsiddharmaiya ke do siton par chunaav ladane ko lekar vipaksh sawaal khadey kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, Siddaramaiah tweeted that the leader who is liked in the whole of Karnataka is not afraid to fight anywhere in the state
 donon siton par janata meraa bhagya tay karegi, isaki chintaa na karen

 ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir jis lokapal bill ke liye 2011 main anna hazaare or kejariwal ne itnaa bada andolan kiya or tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ko ghutanon par laa diya

 dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal kaa kahana he ki unki sarkaar ke sau din or modi sarkaar ke ek saal ke kaam kii tulana honi chahie
 Kejriwal said this in a Google hangout with party workers
 kejariwal ne kaha, '24 may ko hamaari sarkaar ke 100 din puure ho rahe hai or 26 may ko centre kii modi sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa ho rahaa he to mujhe lagata he ki donon ke kaam or is pradarshan kii tulana honi chahie ki hamane kitna kaam kiya or unhone kitna kiya
 ' dilli ke mukhyamantri kii yah baat dilachasp isliye he, kyonki dilli chunaav se thik pehle jab media modi banaam kejariwal kii baat karata tha tab kejariwal or unki party ke log kehete the ki modi piem hai, isliye arvind kejariwal kii tulana bijepi ke siem candidet ke saath karen, kyonki chunaav dilli kaa he desh kaa nahin
 So obviously, now the question arises that when Kejriwal used to refuse comparison with PM Modi at that time, then why is he eager to compare hundred days of work in Delhi only with one year's work in Modi's country? The comments yaad rahe ki aam aadmi party ne dilli chunaav main 'dilli main kejariwal desh main modi' line ko jamkar prachaarit kiya tha
 Of course, at that time both the media and the BJP were following the Modi versus Kejriwal contest, but Kejriwal and his party denied it
 aise main kya ek jeet ne arvind kejariwal ko ek rajya sarkaar ke sau din ke kaam kii tulana centre sarkaar ke ek saal ke kaam se karne kii takat de di he
 Kejriwal said, 'on May 24, our government is completing 100 days and on May 26, one year of the Modi government is being completed, then i think the performance of both should be compared to how much we have Worked and how much they did
 ' This thing of the Chief Minister of Delhi is interesting because just before the Delhi elections, when the media talked about Modi vs Kejriwal, Kejriwal and his party people used to say that Modi is the PM, so compare Arvind Kejriwal with bjp's CM candidate Do, because elections are for Delhi and not for the country to jaahir he, ab sawaal ye uthta he ki jab us samay kejariwal piem modi ke saath tulana se manaa karte the to aaj keval dilli main sau din ke kaam kii tulana vah modi ke desh main ek saal ke kaam se kyon karne ko aatur hai? tippaniyan Remember that the Aam Aadmi Party had strongly promoted the 'modi in Kejriwal Desh in Delhi' line in Delhi elections
 beshak, us samay media or bijepi donon hi modi banaam kejariwal muqabla maanakar chal rahi thim, lekin kejariwal or unki party isko nakaarti thi
 In such a situation, what a victory has given Arvind Kejriwal the power to compare the hundred days work of a state government with the work of one year of the central government

 - input bhashaa In a crazy country like India (cricket), Sachin and cricket are synonyms
 yadi bharat main cricket ko dharm ke taur par mana jaataa he to sachin tendulkar ko hamaare deshvasi bhagwaan ke rup main puujate hai
 Some people stopped watching cricket in India after Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar departed from cricket

 Here, let us tell you that gradually, this veteran completed 3 years of leaving the field
 aise main ve hamaari puri peedi ko bahut kuch siikhaa gaye or aaj tak siikhaa rahe hai
 You should also learn success lessons from them
 
 
 1
 They always remained the same
 
 
 cricket ko najadik se dekhne waalon ko sachin kaa pehle match ke saath hi unka antim match bhi yaad he
 Playing off the streets of Mumbai on the world's best and most dangerous pitches and scoring runs was not a joke
 2
 Always carry the expectations of the whole country
 
 
 yahaan ham apane parivaar ke logon or najdiki doston ke ummiido ko hipura karne main dharashayiho jate hai
 At the same time, the eyes of the entire country were kept on Sachin
 ve maidan main utarate the or puraa maidan sachin-sachin ke naaron se gunjane lagata tha
 Such views will never be seen now
 3
 Always answer with your bat
 
 
 sachin kaa cricket kariyar na jane kitne jhanjhaavaton se hokar gujara
 Accusations of extortion at times, many times due to heavy medical problems
 ve har baar ubar kar baahar aae or hamen vishwaas dilaayaa ki kuch bhi sambhav he
 4
 ve hameshaa apane record ko behatar karne ke liye khele
 
 
 It is said that players like Sachin are born in centuries
 unka compatishanpuri duniya ke khilaadiyon ke bajaay hameshaa khud se rahaa
 People would always compare them with their own records
 5
 a family man away from controversies
 
 
 sachin ne ek aise khel ko apana kariyar banaaya jo hameshaa se hi vivaadon kaa kendra rahaa lekin ve kaalikh kii kothri se bhi bedaag nikal aae
 Today, his example is given all over the world
 iske alaava unka hameshaa kambek karnaa koi maamuli baat to nahin hi he
 a dashing Australian batsman like Matthew Hayden said on Sachin, he has seen God batting
 ve bharat ke liye chauthe number par khelte hai

 varanasi main rang bhari ekadshi : baba vishwanath ke saath logon ne jamkar kheli holi The echo of the recently revealed illegal drug racket in Patna, Bihar's capital, was heard in the Assembly on Friday where the opposition BJP accused the Health Department officials of involvement in it and demanded a CBI inquiry into it

 Patna Express running between Indore and Patna's Rajendra Nagar Terminal derailed near Pukhrayan
 is haadase main kareeb dedh sau logon kii maut hui he
 The death of so many people in an accident of derailing the train definitely surprises everyone
 ab sawaal uthta he ki aakhir aisa kya hua ki rail haadase main itane zyada logon ko apni jaan se haath dhonaa padaa
 Before telling anything more about this railway accident, let us tell what Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu said in his statement in Parliament
 suresh prabhu ne is ghatana kii jaanch karke doshiyon ko sajaa dilaane kii baat kahi he
 But in his statement, the Railway Minister has given the reason behind the loss of so much in this train accident is the old technology ICF coach
 vaise toisief kochajis takanic par bane hue hai wo beete jamaane kii cheez he
 The report of the Anil Kakodkar Committee, made to suggest railways in the matter of safety and security, recommended the complete removal of the ICF coach from the Indian Railways
 is sifarish ko hue 4 saal ho gaye hai, lekin abhi bhi railway main zyaadaatar dibbe isief takanic ke hai
 In such compartments, the box is kept above the bogie
 bogi or dibbe ke bich main judaav bahut zyada majboot nahin hota he
 In such a situation, when a train made of such coaches derails, these coaches are separated from the bogie
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab yah hua ki railgadee ke dibbe main pahiyon samet nichalaa hissaa alag ho jaataa he
 Because of this, the risk of reversal of these coaches is high
 kai trainon main lage german takanic ke dibbeiske alaava puraani takanic ke in dibbon main ek duusari khami yah he ki inaki kapaling scru kapaling he
 For this reason, when these coaches derail, they climb on top of each other
 is prakriya main koi bhi do dibbe ek duusare ko chirate hue andar tak ghus jate hai
 In such a situation, the passengers of the passengers sitting in the coaches leave
 isse haadase main marane waalon kii sankhya bahut zyada ho jaati he
 Perhaps this is the reason that the Kakodkar Committee recommended the complete removal of these coaches from the Indian Railways
 lekin bajet naa hone kii vajah se bhartiya railway main zyaadaatar trainon main puraani takanic ke isief dibbe hi istemaal kiye ja rahe hai
 Currently there are about 53 thousand ICF coaches running across the country
 bhartiya railway ne german takanic par bane alechabi coach chalaane kaa silsilaa shuru kar diya he
 They have been installed in many trains across the country
 lekin abhi bhi bahut kaam baaki he
 
 
 
 aise hua haadasaaie ab ham aapako le chalate hai ravivaar ko hue rail haadase kii taraf
 According to experts, 14 coaches derailed in this train accident, out of which many coaches were overturned and shattered
 railway board ke purv chairman arunendra kumaar ke mutabik sarsari taur par dekhen to yah haadasa patari se dibbe utarane kii vajah se maaloom padataa he
 According to him, if you look closely at the whole accident, you will find that the train is vomited due to any defect in the track
 jaisaa kii najar aa rahaa he kii railgadee kaa ingine sef he
 In the event of cracks on the track, the engine and its adjacent coaches can move faster and the rear compartments can get off the tracks due to this
 jab ingine or agle dibbe tuuti patari se aage nikal chuke the jo pichley dibbe patari se utar gaye
 The situation becomes clearer by looking at the pictures of the train accident
 isamen saaf taur par dikhataa he ki isief coach kii bogi alag ho gai or upree dibba alag
 At the same time, when the rear compartment engaged in the fast moving train derailed, the air pressure pipe in these compartments also broke, due to low pressure, the engine caused automatic brakes
 railway ke aankadon ke mutabik jis samay rail haadasa hua us samay train kii speed 107 kilometre pratighanta thi
 Due to sudden braking at such a speed, many of the rear coaches bounced and went forward
 aise main ek dibba duusare dibbe main ghus gaya
 Due to this, the nomination of the people sitting in these coaches was erased
 in sabake bich patna express ke driver ke mutabik train ko chalaane main aawaaj aa rahi thi or aise main driver ne jhaansi stesan par isaki soochna di lekin us driver ko yah kaha gaya ki is kharabi ko aage kisi stesan par thik kar diya jayega
 In these situations it is believed that the excel of the moving train may have been blocked
 agar aisa hua hoga to jaanch main yah baat saaf taur par saamne nikalakar aegi
 But experts say that even if this happened, the kind of train accident that would have happened would not have happened
 haadase ke peeche ho sakati he sajishdusri taraf aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki is samay mausam main badlaav ho rahaa he or is vajah se raat or din ke taapmaana main kaaphi antar he
 When such a situation arises the probability of fracture in the rail tracks increases
 is tarah kii sthiti se bachane ke liye railway apane gangamain patariyon par chalaati he isse samay rahete kisi fracture ko aasaani se pakadaa ja saktaa he
 Prima facie it did not happen
 in sabake bich rail haadase ko lekar ek conspiresi theory bhi charchaa main he
 Some people believe that Ho Naa Ho is the result of mischief of some people
 lekin jaankaron kii maane unka kahana he ki abhi kisi nishkarsh par pahunchnaa bahut zyada jaldbaaji hogi
 The Ministry of Railways has announced an independent inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter
 kamishnar railway sefti kii adhyakshata main is rail haadase kii jaanch kii jaaegi

 He made an effective emotional appeal to win the Lok Sabha by-election by promising Kannaujas to be his daughter-in-law, daughter and sister-in-law
 bhaashan samaapt karne ke baad ve sidhe shivpal singh yadav ke paas gayi or unke pair chhukar aashirwad liya
 After Dimple, Akhilesh Yadav took over the mic and said, "you guys have made me the Chief Minister
 mere upar badi jimmedaari he
 i will not be able to come to Kannauj election campaign again and again
 aise main dimple ko jitaane kii jimmedaari aapaki he
 After this, the caravan of husband and wife from the rally venue went towards the District Magistrate's Office for nomination
 lekin kaaravaan ke chalane ke baavjood yah sawaal bachaa hi rah gaya ki baaki partiyaan ne apni dum kyon dabaa lee? ise spasht karte hue congress ke varisht netaa pramod tiwari kehete hai ki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa ne amethi or raibareli main apane ummidavaar nahin khadey kiye the or congress ne mainpuri or kannauj se koi pratyaashee nahin utaara tha
 According to Tiwari, "the Congress had decided not to field a candidate from Kannauj during the entire five-year term of the Lok Sabha, which is also applicable in this by-election
" '' party ke ek varisht netaa apana naam na chhapane kii shart par bataate hai ki kannauj or farrukhabad kaa kshetra varisht congressi netaa salmaan khurshid ke prabhaav vaala ilaaka he or beete vidhansabha chunaav main is ilaake main congressi prabhaav kaa patan is kadar hua ki khurshid kii patni louis khurshid bhi apni jamaanat na bachaa sakin
 The political arithmetic of the Congress also forces us not to field candidates in this by-election and by doing so, the Congress has indicated its friendship with Mulayam Singh
 congress mulaayam ko saath lekar pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri or trinmul congress kii netaa mamata banerjee kii ghudakiyon se centre sarkaar ko bachaae rakhana chaahati he
 Not only this, with Mulayam, the Congress is also expected to gain in the coming presidential elections
 pichley 20 saal se kannauj sapa kaa garh he
 Akhilesh Yadav has been an MP for three consecutive terms from here and in the recent assembly elections, the SP has won all its five seats in Kannauj
 bhaajapa kii ulajhn congress se kahin baari rahi
 She announced on June 5 that the candidate would not be fielded, but the following day, on June 6, she was overturned and announced the candidacy of Jagdev Singh Yadav at 11 am
 lekin unke liye kannauj jiladhikari kaa daftar itnaa dur sabit hua ki ve namakan kii miyaad khatm hone ke ek ghante baad hi vahaan pahunch sake
 Jagdev held SP responsible for not filing nomination
 unhone kaha ki unhen lakhanu se kannauj ke raste main sapa kaaryakartaaon ne rokkar baton main ulajhae rakhaa, is vajah se ve samay par nahin pahunch sake
 According to a party leader, the BJP did not have a candidate to fight Kannauj
 kannauj ke ek bhaajapa netaa bataate hai ki upachunaav main utarane vaale ummidavaar ko party kii taraf se kisi bhi tarah kii aarthik madad na dene kii baat kahi gai thi
 Because of this, none of the leaders of Kannauj were willing to contest the by-election, when the BJP had to announce an external candidate in a hurry
 sapa ke pradesh pravaktaa rajendra choudhary bhaajapa dwaara pratyaashee ghoshit kiye jane ko ek sochi-samajhi ranneeti bataate hai
 He says, "about three hours before the nomination is over, a candidate leaves Kannauj from Lucknow to file a form
" namakan form main kai prakaar kii jaankariyon, shapath patr or prastaavak kii jarurat hoti he
 It was not possible to meet these needs in such a short time
 ''is upachunaav main sapa ko takkar dene vaale pratyaashee kii kami bhaajapa ko hi nahin, pradesh kii mukhya vipakshi party basapa ko bhi khal rahi thi
 After the announcement of the Kannauj by-election, no BSP leader applied to the party to contest this election
 chunaav ke prati sthaneey kaaryakartaaon ke nirutsaah ke chalate basapa ne bhi antat namakan ke antim din chunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya
 BSP state president Swami Prasad Maurya explains that there is an atmosphere of anarchy in the entire state since the formation of the SP government
 ve kehete hai, ''sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha tha ki akhilesh sarkaar kaa moolyankan karne se pehle use chah maah kaa samay dena chahie
 Taking care of this deadline, the BSP has decided not to contest elections
 '' khayr, pramukh partiyon ne bhale hi dimple yadav ke khilaaf apane ummidavaar na utaare hon lekin namakan kii antim tithi bitne ke baad do nirdaleey pratyaashee chunaav main bache hue hai
 Perhaps in the hope that the ruling party will 'deal' and take back the name, politics is not right, but luck will shine
 baharhaal, pramukh vipakshi partiyon ne jis tarah se is upachunaav main apane ummidavaar na utarkar dimple yadav ko walkover diya he, usase khud dimple ko bhi is baat kaa andaja nahin rahaa hoga ki unki duusari siyaasi pari kaa aagaaj is tarah bina kisi virodh ke hoga
 By the way, if a tradition is being laid in this by-election, then it is not a better sign for democracy

 IL&FS group jaisi companiyon dwaara diphalt karne se pichley chah maheene main nakadi kii haalat sakht rahi he, is vajah se bank karj dar main zyada giravat nahin kar paa rahe
 The report also details many other challenges facing the economy
 niryaat main phir se teji laana, phixd investment main badhat ko phir se kaayam karnaa or krishi kshetra main ai susti ko dur karnaa bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye agle maheenon kii pramukh chunautiyaan hai
 The report said, "the real effective exchange rate has increased in the fourth quarter of 2018-19 and it may pose a challenge in the way of increasing exports in the near future
 haalanki, jidipi ke pratishat ke lihaaj se dekhen to phixd investment saal 2017-18 se hi bad rahaa he
 But now it can take a break
 isi tarah chauthi timahi main gaiyr khaadya bank karj kii vruddhi dar main bhi kami ai he
 Significantly, the Indian economy is just 6 in the third quarter of October to December, 2018-19
 6 fisadi badi he, jo pichhali chah timahiyon main sabase dhimi gati he
 The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has also set the GDP growth estimate for 2018-19 as 7
 2 fisadi se ghataakar 7 fisadi kar diya he
 Private consumption also declined along with a decline in GDP growth in january-march 2019
 lekin sarkaar ne apana kharch nahin badhaayaa he
 Earlier, international institutions like Asian Development Bank and International Monetary Fund have also lowered the GDP growth forecast in the Indian economy
 edibi ne kaha ki vitt varsh 2020 main bhartiya arthvyavastha kii vruddhi dar 7
 Will remain 2 percent
 IMF kaa anumaan he ki 2019-20 main bhartiya arthvyavastha kii vruddhi dar 7
 3 percent, which will increase to 7 in 2020-21
 5 fisadi par pahunch jaaegi
 Roughly with Manto's authorship, hardly as much was done to anyone
 logon ne dutkaara or katghare main bhi kai dafe khadaa kiya, yahaan tak ki logon ne sahityakar maanane se bhi inkaar kar diya tha
 But when you read Manto, one feels that when the crowd was tearing down clothes like clothes in a storm of rapes and loot
 jab havas or vahash kaa nazaaraa ankhon ke saamne dekh rahe the to manto pagal ho gaye the
 It is said that there is no greater intoxication than sleep but there is hunger in the way of sleep
 bhukh chaahe jism kii ho yaa roti kii lekin is bhukh ko mitaane ke liye roti par hi jismani mashkkat hote dekh manto pagal ho gaye the
 Standing at the nook and showing the drama of power, Safdar Hashmizab when the lines strewn on the ground had separated the wisdom and wisdom of the people, and when humans were seen not to be meat, then Manto went mad
 garibon ke haath main jalati mashaal jaisi hai is kavi kii likhi nazmenunke chaahane vaale kehete hai ki bharat-pakistan ke bantwaare ke dard ko agar kisi ne samajha he to wo manto hi the
 The stories that come out of that 'crazy' mind pierce your reality and laugh at your hollowness
 aaj ke hi din (11 may 1912) ko saadat hasan manto kaa janm hua tha

 chakravaati tufaan hudahud pedo ko ukhaadte or bijli ke khambhon ko giraate hue vishakhapattanam tat se gujara, jabaki is kaaran ai barish se sambandhit ghatnaon main teen logon kii maut ho gai
 Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary IVR Krishna Rao said, "three people were reported to have died due to the impact of Hudhud"
 unhone bataaya ki chakravaat ke dauraan 195 se 200 kilometre prati ghante kii raftaar vaali aandhi se bahut se ped ukhd jane kii khabar he
 Electric poles and mobile towers were also uprooted
 isse kshetra main bijli evam sanchaar network prabhavit hua he
 Rao said that people in Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts have been asked to stay indoors and if the walls of their houses are weak, they can go to cyclone relief centers
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki vishakhapattanam tat se gujara chakravaat pehle ghante main dhimaa prathit ho rahaa he, lekin logon ko paraamarsh kaa paalan karnaa chahie, kyonki yah baad main achaanak se bheeshan ho saktaa he
 The Chief Secretary informed that NDRF teams have been deployed in the affected areas
 vijaydashami ke utsav ke maukey par rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke salaana kaarykram main sangh pramukhmohan bhagwatne apane sambodhan main kaha kiraam mandirke liye kanoon bananaa chahie
 Questioning Bhagwat's statement, Pravin Togadia, president of the International Hindu Council, has said that the feelings of Hindus and the memory of Lord Rama were remembered when elections in 4 states and soon the Center came to a close
 ab tak kyon chup rahe?praveen togadiya ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki 1989 main bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini main kaha gaya tha ki sansad main purna bahumat main sarkaar aegi tab kanoon banaakar bhavy ram mandir kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 Hundreds of Hindus died in trust of this promise, thousands were imprisoned
 or jab centre main purna bahumat kii sarkaar ai, tab pichley 4
 For 5 years the voice of the Rambhaktas was suppressed
 togadiya ne daawa kiya 2017 main bhopal main baithak bulaakar aresas dwaara kaha gaya ki sansad main ram mandir ke kanoon kii baat bolnaa band karo
 Despite the demand of many saints in Udupi in November 2017 Dharmasansad, the proposal of legislation on Ram temple was not brought, which was contrary to the demand of the last 14 Dharmasansad
 togadiya ne sawaal kiya ki ram mandir par kanoon kii maang ko lekar anshan kar rahe sant paramhansadas ko jab upi police ghasitkar le gai, tab aaj ke bauddhik dene vaale kahaan the? togadiya ne maang kii he ki ram mandir main kanoon laane main 4
 The central government, BJP and their mother-in-law RSS should apologize to Hindus for 5 years of unforgivable delay
 saath hi togadiya ne ultimatum diya he ki 21 oktober se pehle centre sarkaar ayodhya main ram mandir par adhyadesh laakar sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaakar uskaa kanoon banaae
 It is worth mentioning that Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had said in his address that the Ram temple must be constructed by any means, for this the government should bring a law
 unhone kaha tha ki log kehete hai ki inaki satta he phir bhi mandir kyon nahin bana, voter sirf ek hi din kaa raja rahata he
 And it's a wrap! Goodbye Alauddin
 1 year and a few weeks later, i bid thee farewell
 May your restless soul find its peace

 philhal yuvak ke chachaa kii shikaayat par ek yuvak ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 Giving information about the case in detail, the police officer said that the matter is of Khardwal village of Sadar police station Narwana
 police ne bataaya ki yuvak fande kii rassi tuutane se neeche girakar ghayal ho gaya
 The family has admitted her to the general hospital in Narwana after her condition worsens
 police ne bataaya ki yuvak ke chachaa kii shikaayat par sadar thana narwanaa police ne ek yuvak ke khilaaf jaan lene kii koshish tathaa anusuchit jati / anusuchit janajati utpeedan rokthaam kanoon samet vibhinn dhaaraon main maamla darj kiya he
 Police is investigating the case
 police ne bataaya ki kharadwal nivasee satyawan ne apni shikaayat main bataaya ki gaanv nehra nivasee raman ne uske bhattije vikaas ko gat 22 oktober ko phone karke kheton main bulaayaa
 Raman asked Vikas to make a tick talk video in which he had to hang on a noose hanging on a tree
 police ne bataaya ki satyawan ne shikaayat main kaha he ki jab uske bhattije ne manaa kiya to use jatisuchak gaaliyaan di
 Due to fear, Vikas climbed the tree with a rope and hanged it, while Raman kept making his tick talk video
 ittefaq se rassi kamjor hone ke chalate tut gayi or uskaa bhatija neeche gir gaya, lekin gale main rassi kaa kasaav hone or neeche girane se use chotein ain
 Police said that the complainant stated that Vikas was taken to Narwana General Hospital after the situation deteriorated and is still hospitalized and having trouble breathing
 police ke anusaar satyawan ne aarope lagaaya ki raman uske bhattije vikaas ko maarna chahta tha

 panchayat ajtak ke chauthe seshan '19 kaa bos koun!' main congress netaa digvijay singh or bijepi netaa prakaash jaavdekar ne hissaa liya
 In this session, journalist Rajdeep Sardesai raised the issue of demonetisation, while Prakash Javadekar clarified that this demonetisation was the first campaign against black money
 bijepi se pehle kii sarkaron ke mantralayon main khuleam dallali hoti thi
 In such a situation, we came up with many plans
 rajeev gandhi kehete the ham garib ko 100 rupee bhejte hai to 15 rupee pahunchate hai
 Now when Modi sends 100 rupees to the government, then he used to reach 100 rupees
 is mudde par digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki piem modi kii sootboot kii sarkaar he
 Also raised the issue of Hinotbandi
 digvijay ne kaha ki modi ne kaha ki notebandi se kalaadhan khatm ho jayega, aatankwaad par lagaam lagegaa, phek karency khatm hogi aadi
 However, the way demonetisation was implemented, many people died
 bina koi taiyaari kiye lagu karne se lakhon logon ko pareshaani hui
 The Congress leader said that claims were made to end corruption through demonetisation
 lekin uski taiyaari kya kii thi, 80 pratishat karency bazaar se hataakar aapane 15 lakh logon ke rojgaar chin liye hai
 i want to tell that people stood in lines for hours due to demonetisation and they were killed
 alam ye rahaa ki 50 din main 66 baar niyam badale
 In such a situation, what was the benefit of demonetisation
 iske jawaab main prakaash jaavdekar ne safai di ki notebandi siries of ection kaa hissaa thi
 In 2011, the Supreme Court said that Kikaladhanbadi is the problem
 3 saal congress sarkaar ne is par kaam nahin kiya, bijepi sarkaar aate hi ection shuru hua
 After demonetisation, many reports are being processed
 3 lakh shell companiyaan notebandi kii vajah se band hui
 However, the jugaadantra in the country removes every law
 iske baavjood modi sarkaar ne kaledhan ke khilaaf 3 kanoon paas kiye
 Prakash Javadekar alleged that as black money is being controlled, the opposition of Congress is increasing
 ki modi sarkaar ko congress kaledhan ke khilaaf kaam nahin karne de rahi he
 Congress is blocking the Whistleblower Protection Act
 bhrashtachar or kaale dhan ke sawaal par digvijay ne chalange karte hue kaha ki is mudde par arun jetali or ram jethmalani kii bahes kara dijie
 The Modi government increased the tax on diesel and petrol, but who killed it
 aapako bataa den ki aaj modi sarkaar ke chaar saal puure ho gaye hai
 On this occasion, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his cabinet ministers and BJP leaders will present the achievements of the government to the public, 'aaj Tak' has also called a panchayat on this occasion

 BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has claimed that the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya will be done by consensus and the construction of the temple will begin by the end of this year
 swami ne daawa kiya ki is saal ke ant tak ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan kaary shuru kar diya jayega or 9 janvari ko iske liye ection plan kaa elaan kiya jayega
 Construction will be done by consensus, however, Swamy also made it clear that the temple will not be built through any movement
 unhone kaha ki mandir nirmaan kaa kaam aam sahmati se hoga
 This work will be done with the court order and the mutual consent of Hindus and Muslims
 unhone ummid jaahir kii ki agast-sitambar tak is maamle main supreme court kaa faisla aa jayega
 Not an election campaign anywhere? Speaking to reporters at the Vishwa Hindu Parishad office on Wednesday, Swamy said that we hope to start the temple construction work in the next two-three months
 nahin to saal ke aakhir tak yah kaam jarur shuru ho jayega
 He was asked if this decision has not been taken keeping in mind the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections next year? On this, Swamy said that the case of Shriram is of faith and faith for Hindus
 ayodhya main mandir nirmaan ke liye har hindu patibaddh he
 Shri Ram should not be associated with elections
 diu main sammelanswami ne kaha ki hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich is mudde ke sauhardpurn samaadhaan ke liye bhi prayaas kiya ja rahaa he
 Swamy said that a two-day conference is being organized at Delhi University on this issue
 is dauraan lagbhag teen sau vidwaan, shikshavid or puratatvvid is masale par charchaa karenge
 This issue came to the headlines after the Shiva Puja was done by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya before the church broke out of Shilapujan

 Earlier, senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Vinay Katiyar had asked Muslims to relinquish their claim on Ayodhya while reiterating the construction of the Ram temple
 unhone kaha ki ayodhya par muslim apana daawa chhod den ab sabit ho gaya he ki yah ram janmabhumi hi he
 Katiyar even said that the government can also make laws in Parliament as a third option in the construction of Ram temple
 viechpi ne shuru kiya tha rashtravyapee abhiyaandrasal, viechpi kii ore se ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kii khatir chah maheene pehle deshbhar se pathar ikattha karne kaa rashtravyapee abhiyaan shuru kiya gaya tha

 They are afraid of being crowned as rulers

 Yes, we need mirrors, guns and cannons
 kya ham ye sab bairuni mulkon se kharidte rahenge? hamen in sabake liye paison kii sakht zarurat he
 Should we accept tax from these bulls, who collect rent from the crowns? While we get free sandal wood and elephant teeth

 pakistan ke ek akhbaar kaa kahana he ki bharat-pakistan match dharmashala se kolkata sthanantarit hone ke baad bisisiai ko pakistan ke darshakon ke liye vaikalpik intjaam karne chahie
 The newspaper has written that BCCI should make separate arrangements for those who have purchased tickets for Dharamshala matches and have booked in hotels

 international cricket council (isisi) kii match ko sthanantarit karne kii ghoshnaa se yah dar khatm ho gaya ki pakistan toornament se naam waapas le saktaa he
 Increased intolerance in India, violent reactions against problems, and political culture woven around hatred of Pakistan are the main issues
 'congress samet sabhi rajnatik dal jimmedaarakhbaar ke sampadakeey main likhaa gaya he ki himachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ne antim samay par samasyaon ko janm diya

 For the last few months, there has been a continuous debate about privacy in the country
 sarkaar kii taraf se court main privesi yani niztaa ko moulik adhikaar nahin bataaya gaya
 Now the Supreme Court has given its verdict on this matter and now it will be considered within the fundamental right under Article 21
 is faisle ke baad sarkaar ko thodi mushkil jarur ho sakati he, kyonki exparts aadhaar ko niztaa main send maanate aae hai
 a petition has been filed against Aadhaar
 sarkaar kii taraf se daleel diya gaya ki digital world main log apni jaankariyaan third party websites jaise fasebuk or google ko detii hai
 After this decision of the Supreme Court, there are many more cases which need to be given attention
 udhaaharan ke taur par niztaa ko puri tarah se paribhaashit nahin kiya gaya he
 Prior to this, many decisions have been made in which privacy has been considered difficult to define
 isliye is faisle ke baad bhi Section 377, Section 66A or Aadhaar main kya fark padegaa yah philhal kahana mushkil he
 Former Home Minister P
 chidambaram ne kaha he, 'aadhaar banane ke liye jaankaree dena yah bada mudda nahin he
 Because the government can keep such information for identity
 sabase bada mudda ye tha ki aadhaar ko duusari jaruri sarvice ke liye anivaary kiya ja rahaa he
 Even in the coming time, Aadhaar will be needed for taking a mobile number or for railway tickets
 yahi sabase badi samasya he ki aadhaar ditels kisi privet company ko kyon di jaae
 'apart from Aadhaar, there are many other matters which can make the government difficult
 inamen Article 377 he jiske tahat homosexuelity ko aparaadh mana jaataa he
 Apart from this, Section 66A of the IT Act is under which action can be taken against that person if a person keeps thinking on his social media account and the government sees something wrong in him
 Article 377 or IT Act Section 66A par bhi padegaa asaraadhar ke alaava Article 377 or Section 66A do aise act hai jinpar supreme court ke faisle kaa asar pad saktaa he
 Since privacy is now a fundamental right, the government cannot take information from a person's personal account
 aamtaur par sarkaar or sarkari agenciyon ko yah akhriyaar hota he ki kisi shaks ke personal acount main send laga sake
 At present, no decision has been made on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, but in the coming time it will be clear only after the government's stand that where Aadhaar will be made mandatory
 haal hi main laagtara aadhaar ke data li hone kii khabaren aati rahi hai
 But there were questions in people's mind that what should they do if the data is leaked? Who should sue? Whom to complain to? Now the answer has been found after this decision of the Supreme Court
 chunki aadhaar banane ke liye di gai jaankariyaan nijee hoti hai or supreme court ke is faisle ke baad niztaa moulik adhikaar he
 In such a situation, if the data is leaked then the accountability of the government increases, whose data is leaked, they can take against it
 haalanki isse pehle bhi kanoon the, lekin ab ye praayogic ho jaaenge
 The pressure on the government to increase security, till now, the Aadhaar data kept leaking from government websites and neither many litigants nor anyone understood what to do against it
 lekin supreme court ke is faisle ke baad ab aadhaar hi nahin balki kisi bhi tarah kaa yujar date li hua to sarkaar ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 Therefore, there is a need to strengthen government websites
 whatsapp or Facebook kii mushkilen kam ho sakati hanisase pehle tak whatsap or fasebuk se jaankariyaan maangi jaati rahi hai
 Every year the government asks for user data from Facebook for National Security
 itnaa hi nahin whatsap par lagaataar sawaal uthe hai ki isaki privesi policy kii vajah se log galat karke batch sakate hai
 Because the end to end encryption of whatsapp prevents any government agency from taking its data
 aise main is faisle ke baad whatsap or fasebuk jaise plateform par yujar data dene kaa dabaav bhi nahin banaaya ja saktaa

 com / zjhi9sjixa People eagerly wait for a date of the month
 1 taarikh kaa aamtaur par matlab hota he tankhwaah aana, jeb noton se bharaa hona
 But on Monday, June 1, your pocket will not lighten heavily
 aisa isliye kyonki aapako manhagaai kaa jhatka lagane vaala he
 Service tax 12 from 1 June
 36 fisadi se badhkar 14 fisadi ho jayega
 That is, your bill on every service is about 1
 6 fisadi bad jayega
 This increase of one and a half per cent may seem minor, but the problem is that this big chunk of kisses tax will keep chipping your household budget
 aaie jaanate hai ki kahaan-kahaan aapaki jeb halki hone vaali he:- chuttee ke kaarykram ke liye aap agar travel agent kii seva lete hai to aapako use zyada paise chukaane hogen
 - If you talk to friends on the phone to make a holiday program, then there will be an increased tax on the phone bill
 - safar chaahe hawaii jahaaj se karen yaa train ke asi dabbe main, sarvice tex kii maar se nahin batch sakenge
 - Staying in hotel or eating in restaurant, everything will be expensive
 haalanki jaanane kii baat yah bhi he ki14 fisadi sarvice taxke baad ab aapako iske upar ajukeshan ses yaa koi or ses nahin dena hoga
 It is worth noting that some selected services like school education fees, hospital treatment are outside this scope
 sarvice tex kii maar kitni padegi, iskaa andaja aap kuch is tarah se laga sakate hai:- ebetment kii chhot ke baad tamaam services main puure bill ke kuch hi hisse par sarvice tex lagata he
 That is, you do not have to pay service tax on the entire bill
 masalan restraan main khaane ke bill par aapako14 nahin balki 5
 6% service tax will have to be paid
 - 100 rupee ke telephone bill par 106 rupee dena hoga, vahiin socity chargeej agar do hajaar dete hai to aapako 2032 rupee dene honge
 - Rail passengers traveling in first class or AC class will incur the heat of service tax
 yahaan bhi kul yatri kiraye par 4
 There will be an increase of 2 percent
 lekin pehle se 3
 7% service tax is being levied, so you have to pay about five rupees more on the ticket of thousand rupees
 aam log bhale is sarvice tex ke vajan se pareshaan hue ja rahe hon lekiderthshastriyon kii nigaah main is intjaam ke doorgaami nattijehonge
 Also, this will be a big step towards Goods and Services Tax
 kyonki jiesti kaa jhatka tagada hoga, lihaaja yah intjaam jor kaa jhatka dhire se lagayegaa

 ucchtam shiksha wo he, jo hamen sirf jaankaree hi nahin detii, balki hamaare jivan ko samast astitv ke saath sadbhaav bhi laati he

 har ek kathinaayee jisase aap munh mode lete hai, ek bhoot ban kar aapaki neend main baadha daalegi
 Rabindranath Tagore is the only Indian litterateur to have received the Nobel Prize for his works
 rabindranath tagore ne kavitaayen likhane ke saath hi safal jivan jeene ko lekar bhi kai vichaar die hai
 Many of his ideas that can bring big changes in your life
 1
 Let us not pray that threats do not come upon us, but pray that we can face them fearlessly
 2
 You cannot cross the ocean just by standing and staring at the water
 3
 If work is taken from dependents in lieu of shelter, it is worse than job
 usase ashraydaan kaa mahatva hi jaataa rahata he
 4
 hameshaa tark karne vaala dimag dhar vaala vah chaaku he jo prayog karne vaale ke haath se hi khun nikaal detaa he
 5
 kisi bachche kii shiksha apane gyaan tak simit mat rakhie, kyonki vah kisi or samay main paidaa hua he
 6
 keval prem hi vaastaviktaa he, ye mahaj ek bhaavana nahin he
 This is the absolute truth that dwells in the heart of creation
 7
 The moon spreads its light across the sky but keeps its stigma on itself
 8
 Just as the nest gives shelter to the sleeping bird, similarly silence gives shelter to your voice
 9
 If you close the doors to all the mistakes then the truth will be left out automatically
 10
 Showers of arguments, dust of arguments and blindness
 ye sab aakul vyakul hokar laut jaati he, kintu vishwaas to apane andar hi nivas karata he, use kisi prakaar kaa bhay nahin he
 11
 desh kaa jo atmabhimaan, hamaari shakti ko aage badhaata he, vah prashansaneey he
 But the self-respect that pulls us back, it only binds with pegs, it is a damn thing
 12
 Each child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man
 13
 You cannot gather the beauty of a flower by breaking its petals
 14
 The water in the vessel always shines and the sea water is always darker (fuzzy)
 laghu satya ke shabd hameshaa spashth hote hai, mahaan satya maun rahata he
 15
 beej ke hryday main pratiksha karata hua vishwaas jivan main ek mahaan aashcharya kaa vaada karata he, jise vah usee samay siddh nahin kar saktaa
 16
 maine swapn dekha ki jivan anand he
 i woke up and found that life is service
 maine seva kii or paaya ki seva main hi anand he
 17
 jo aatma sharir main rahati he, vahi ishwar he or chetana rup se vivek ke dwaara sharir ke sabhi ango se kaam karwaati hai
 People forget that goddess and run to the pilgrimages

 1
 aaie ham yah prarthana na karen ki hamaare upar khatre na aaen, balki yah prarthana karen ki ham unka nidarta se saamana kar saken
 2
 sirf khadey hokar pani ko takate rahane se aap samudra ko paar nahin kar sakate
 3
 aashray ke evaj main yadi ashriton se kaam hi liya gaya, to vah naukari se bhi badtar he
 The importance of shelter keeps going away from him
 4
 The always reasoning mind is the sharpened knife that removes blood from the hands of the user
 5
 Do not limit the education of a child to his knowledge, because he is born at some other time
 6
 Only love is reality, it is not just a feeling
 yah ek param satya he jo srijan ke hryday main vaas karata he
 7
 chandramaa apana prakaash sampurna akaash main failaata he parantu apana kalank apane hi paas rakhata he
 8
 jis tarah ghonslaa soti hui chidiya ko aashray detaa he usee tarah maun tumhaari vaani ko aashray detaa he
 9
 yadi aap sabhi galatiyon ke liye daravaaje band kar denge to sach apane aap baahar rah jayega
 10
 tarkon kii jhadi, tarkon kii dhuli or andhbuddhi
 All this is disturbed and returns, but the faith resides in itself, it has no fear
 11
 The spirit of the country, which advances our power, is praiseworthy
 par jo atmabhimaan hamen peeche khinchataa he, vah sirf khunte se baandhta he, yah dhikkaraneey he
 12
 prayek shishu yah sandesh lekar aata he ki ishwar abhi manushyon se niraash nahin hua he
 13
 phool kii pankhudiyon ko tod kar aap uski sundarataa ko ikaitha nahin kar sakate
 14
 bartan main rakhaa pani hameshaa chamakta he or samudr kaa pani hameshaa gahare rang (aspasht) kaa hota he
 The words of the small truth are always clear, the great truth remains silent
 15
 Waiting faith in the heart of the seed promises a great wonder in life, which he cannot prove at the same time
 16
 i dreamed that life is bliss
 main jaagaa or paaya ki jivan seva he
 i served and found that there is joy in the service itself
 17
 The soul that resides in the body is the same God and through consciousness conscience makes all the parts of the body work
 log us antardev ko bhul jate hai or daud-daud kar tirthon main jate hai
 18
 kattarta sach ko un haathon main surakshit rakhane kii koshish karti he jo use maarna chaahate hai
