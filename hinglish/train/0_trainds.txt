 - subjiyon kii keemat aksar ghatati badhati rahati hai jaise halhi main pyaaj kii badi keemton ne logon ko mahangaai ke aansu rulaae hai
 In such a situation, if you use less onion or use it less in gravy vegetable, you can still save some

 That is why take a small pack instead of very large so that it ends in a short time and they also retain their taste

 saat rajyon kii police ke liye mistry ban chuki haniprit ko ajtak ne talash liya he
 Honeypreet has given an explanation on Aaj Tak's camera and described Gurmeet Ram Rahim as innocent
 faraar hone ke baad pehali baar haniprit ajtak ke camere par ai he, magar police abhi tak use nahin khoj pai he
 Honeypreet was absconding since Gurmeet Ram Rahim was convicted on 25 August
 jiske baad haryana police samet 7 rajyon kii police uski talash kar rahi he
 But till now the police and other investigating agency have not been able to arrest Honeypreet
 magar, ajtak par haniprit ne jo khulaase kiye hai, unke baad bhi kai sawaalon ke jawaab nahin mil paae hai
 The answers given by Honeypreet have also raised many questions
 1
 Who did the guide to Honeypreet? Honeypreet said that she was surprised after Baba was punished
 yahaan tak ki wo depressant main chali gai thi
 Honeypreet said, 'I did not know the legal process
 papa ke jane ke baad main besahaara ho gai
 i did as the people guide me '
 aise main sawaal ye he ki aakhir wo koun log hai, jinhone haniprit ko guide kiya
 Who are those people who asked Honeypreet to remain absconding? Who are those people who did not let Honeypreet surrender? Who are those people who hid Honeypreet till now? 2
 kisne rachi sajeesh?haniprit ne apni safai main ye bhi kaha ki baba ke jail jane ke baad uske dimaan ne kaam karnaa band kar diya tha
 Honeypreet said, "would i have conspired against anyone in such a situation? Actually, Honeypreet was questioned that she is facing allegations of being a villain
" jiskaa unhone ye jawaab diya
 But then the question arises that if Honeypreet did not play the role of a villain in Baba's black misdeeds, then who are the people who are Gurmeet's henchmen and do black business from his empire? 3
 vishwaas gupta par kyon nahin boli haniprit?haniprit ke pati vishwaas gupta ne bhi media ke saamne aakar us par behad gambhir aarope lagaae the
 Vishwas had claimed that there were physical connections between Baba and Honeypreet
 jab vishwaas gupta par haniprit se sawaal kiya gaya to usne kaha, 'main vishwaas gupta ke mudde par koi baat nahin karnaa chaahati hum'
 In such a big question, why did Honeypreet not say anything to Vishwas Gupta, who made serious allegations against Honeypreet publicly? 4
 kisne banaaya heroin?haniprit ne baba ke saath film main bhi kaam kiya he
 Aaj Tak also questioned Honeypreet about this
 jab haniprit se poocha gaya ki kya ram rahim unhen filmon main lekar aae to haniprit ne isse inkaar kiya
 Honeypreet said, 'I did not want to be a heroine
 main hameshaa kahati thi ki main camere ke peeche rahanaa chaahati hum'
 After which the question is arising that if Baba did not make Honeypreet a heroine, then how did she come in films? 5
 dilli koun laayaa?jis haniprit ko saat suubon kii police nahin talash paa rahi he, wo rajdhani dilli aane kaa khulaasa kiya he
 Earlier, the lawyer, who filed an anticipatory bail petition of Honeypreet in the Delhi High Court, had told about her coming to Delhi
 aise main sawaal ye bhi he ki wo koun log hai jo haniprit ko lekar dilli tak aa gaye or kisi ko bhanak tak nahin lagi?haryana sarkaar kii safivahin haniprit ko ab nahin pakad paane ke masale par haryana ke sattadhari dal bijepi ne bhi safai di he
 Haryana BJP spokesman Jawahar Yadav has said that the government or BJP has never questioned Gurmeet Ram Rahim and Honeypreet's relationship
 saath hi unhone kaha ki haryana police ne is maamle main 1850 log giraftaar kiye hai
 In such a situation, it is wrong to question the police
 bollywood actress shridevi ko is duniya se vidaa hue takreeban ek saal ho gaya he
 However, it is still difficult for the fans to accept that the veteran actress Sridevi is no longer in this world
 vah abhishek varman ke nirdesan main ban rahi film kalank main kaam karne vaali thim lekin unke is duniya se vidaa hone ke baad nirdeshak ko unke role ke liye kisi or ko cast karnaa tha
 Abhishek cast Madhuri Dixit for this role after much deliberation
 total dhamal ke pramotion ke dauraan 51 varshiya maadhuri ne bataaya ki is baat ko sweekaar karnaa kitna mushkil tha ki shridevi nahin raheen
 She said, "it took a long time to accept that she was no more
 yah bahut shwking tha
 My reaction was that you want me to roll this? Because they were also very forced
 unhen kaam to karte rahanaa tha
 "he said," It was difficult to accept this on a human era
 ek kalakaar ke taur par aapako role or script pataa hota he
 These two are completely different things
 lekin sach ko sweekaar karnaa bahut mushkil tha
 "please tell that after Sridevi's death, her daughter Jahnavi Kapoor posted a picture of her mother with Madhuri on social media
 unhone iske capshan main likhaa, "shukriya meri maa kaa role lene ke liye
 "view this post on instagrama post shared by Janhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) onaug 12, 2018 at 12:29 pm PDT He wrote," Abhishek Varman's next film was very close to my mother's heart

 "let us know that on 24 February 2018, Sridevi died by drowning in a bathtub

 a post shared byjanhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) onmar 19, 2018 at 1:12 am pdtview this post on Instagram # Dhadak # Dhadak a post shared byjanhvi Kapoor (@janhvikapoor) onnov 15, 2017 at 3:53 am PST aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki jharkhand main vidhansabha chunaav (jharkhand Assembly election 2019) main mahagathbandhan (mahagathbandhan) kii takkar bhaajapanit endie (NDA) or raghubar das (raghubar Das) se hogi
 BJP workers had also given a very enthusiastic slogan 'ghar-ghar Raghubar' and 'abki Baar Sixty-five Paar'
 par aisa lagata he ki jharkhand kii siyasat, khaskar bhaajapa main kaddavar haisiyat rakhane vaale sarayu raay (saryu Rai) ke baagi hone or ol jharkhand students union (ajasu) ke khulkar kham thonkane ke baad bhaajapa mahagathbandhan (mahagathbandhan) kii bajaae apano se ladane main mubtila ho gai he
 The battle is so bitter that the rebel Saryu Rai has filed a protest against Jamshedpur East seat against Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das, in whose cabinet he himself was the Minister of Food and Supplies till Sunday
 
 ab ladaai sidhi ho gai he
 Raghubar Das also fights from Jamshedpur East seat
 asal main, sarayu raay ko is chunaav main tikat nahin diya gaya tha
 At a press conference in Jamshedpur on Saturday, Rai had said angrily, "it is not appropriate for me to beg the party leadership for a seat
 isliye maine unase mere naam par vichaar nahin karne ko kaha he
 On Sunday itself, Rai resigned from the post of MLA as well as the minister
 par gauratlab he ki raay ne bhaajapa kii sadsyta se istipha nahin diya he
 The Mahagathbandhan immediately grabbed the occasion, but hesitated to support Rai
 purv mukhyamantri or jharkhand mukti morcha (jhamumo) ke netaa hemanth sorain (hemant Soren) ne sarayu raay ke is qadam kaa swaagat kiya or ranchi main kaha ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai main ve sarayu raay (saryu Rai) ke saath khadey hai
 Hours after his statement, the Congress party announced the announcement of its popular spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh from Jamshedpur East seat
 par sarayu raay (saryu Rai) aakhir raghubar das (raghubar Das) ke liye kitne khatarnaak ho sakate hai? jharkhand kii raajnneeti main sarayu raay (saryu Rai) kii ahmiyat kya he? iskaa jawaab haih bahut
 Saryu Rai has played an important role in bringing the fodder scam in bihar-jharkhand to the public and leading to his court investigation
 sarayu raay (saryu Rai) ne jharkhand ke purv mukhyamantri madhu kodaa ko jail bhijwane main sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi
 His reputation in Jharkhand grew considerably
 raghubar das ne jamshedpur purvi seat se pehla chunaav 1995 main ladaa tha
 The BJP then contested the election by cutting the ticket of its sitting MLA Dinanath Pandey
 pandeya ne shivasena ke samarthan se nirdaleey chunaav ladaa or raghubar das (raghubar Das) bamushkil chunaav jeet paae the
 But from then on Raghubar Das continued to win this seat
 2009 main vah pehali baar jharkhand ke upmukhyamantri bane or saal 2014 main mukhyamantri
 He won the last assembly election in 2014 with a margin of over 70,000 votes
 tab yahaan bhaajapa ko 61
 5 percent votes were received
 tab congress 19
 She finished second with 8 percent votes
 bhaajapa ummidavaar ke taur par das ko 1,03,427 vot mili the
 Now the Jharkhand assembly election has become quite interesting since the personal form of this bitter and bitter fight
 aakhir, raghubar das (raghubar Das) kaa raajnneetik kariyar tabhi aage badhegaa, balki chamakegaa agar vah sarayu raay ko haraa dete hai
 If Das loses the election, the danger of his political innings will come to an end

 View this post on instagramas Akshay Kumar gave his Last shot today for Our Cop Universe ‘sooryavanshi’, It takes me back to 9 years ago in 2010 when Golmaal 3 became a massive hit
 That day i had mentioned to Ajay Devgn that i was looking forward to making an action film on cops and eventually we made Singham
 i never imagined that Singham’s journey would ultimately weave in such magnificent characters like the notorious Ranveer Singh as Simmba and now the Dynamic Akshay Kumar as Sooryavanshi, becoming the country’s First cinematic Cop Universe
 And today 9 years later when i wrap my last shot with Akshay playing Sooryavanshi it magically coincides with the day we announce our next venture - Golmaal FIVE

 Want to hang for the poor of Delhi

 pune main 72 ranon kii haar ke baad bhartiya khiladiyon ke chehre kii rangath ud gai thi
 Neither bowling nor good batting in Pune
 saat maichon kii siries main buudhvaar ko baari thi jaipur kii
 In Jaipur, the lions of India did such an act that Australian captain George Bailey had to say - 'I cannot understand what i feel at this time'
 jaipur main bhi pune kii hi tarah australia ne toss jeeta
 Decided to bat first
 faisla kaaphi had tak sahi sabit hua
 The first five batsmen scored and lost 5 wickets in 50 overs to put a mountain score of 359 in front of India
 bhartiya bowler ek baar phir naakaam sabit hue the
 Barring Bhuvneshwar Kumar, no bowler has an economy rate below 6
 is vakt bhartiya prashansakon ke chehre se havaaiyaan udi hui thim
 The score was huge and Pune's defeat was still fresh in the mind
 dar tha ki yadi ye match bhi haar gaye kya hoga
 After half an hour's lunch, India came out to bat
 team india ke 'gabbar' shikhar dhawan ke saath rohit sharma opening karne aae
 Both started fast and slow
 ran rate 6 se zyada hi rakhaa
 It was also needed
 isi chakkar main kai aade-tirchhe shot bhi lagaae
 Shikhar Dhawan had not yet completed his half-century that he missed a very easy catch
 iske baad 'gabbar' dhawan ne sir par kafan baandh liya or danaadan ballebaaji shuru kar di
 The other end was held by Rohit Sharma
 wicket haath main the, score bhi ban rahaa tha, par dhadakanen tej thim
 Anything could have happened
 idhar bhi udhar bhi
 
 
 The 27th over started
 bharat 176 ran bana chukaa tha
 Shikhar Dhawan was out on the very first ball of this over
 unhone beshkeemtee 95 ran jode, magar shatak se chook gaye
 Nervous ninety dilli ke sher viraat kohli aae or aate hi apane iraade jaahir kar die
 He played such shots around the field, as if he were playing with Cosco's ball
 pehle 27 gendon main fifty banaai or phir 52 gendon main 100 bana liye
 The Australian bowlers were not only getting wickets, they were also failing completely in stopping the rain of fours and sixes
 rohit sharma ne 123 gendon par 141 (note out) or viraat ke 52 gendon par puure 100 (note out) ranon ke saath 44waan over puraa hone se pehle hi australia kaa pahaad khaak main tabdeel kar diya
 There was a festive atmosphere all around the field and the colors of the Indian players returned
 jaahir he yah badi or aitihaasik agle maichon ke liye bhartiya sheron kaa hausala buland karegi
 Australia used 6 bowlers
 inamen se ek bhi bowler aisa nahin tha, jiskaa iconomi rate 7 se neeche rahaa ho
 Australian players could not understand anything while shooting
 pehali baar australia kii kaman sambhaal rahe jorge baili ne baad main kaha- 'samaj main nahin aa rahaa, kya mahasoos karun
 Indian batsmen have done wonders in the end
 hamane to apane saare astr chalaa kar dekh liye the, lekin sab vyarth ja rahe the
 'if you mind, in the Pune match, the Australian bowlers harassed the Indian batsmen by putting small balls
 lekin jaipur main choti genden bhi seemaa rekha ke baahar najar aa rahi thim
 Shikhar Dhawan said, 'we started carefully
 jab tik gaye to bade shot khele
 Rohit Sharma performed very well
 main bahut khush hum
 'I played many stoopid shots: Rohit Sharmorata Sharma said-' i agree that i played many stoopid shots, but playing such shots required a match
 ' rohit sharma ne 'match of da match' chune jane ke baad kaha ki unhen is lambii pari kii bahut jarurat thi
 He wanted to stay at the crease for 50 overs
 target mat dekho, bas khelte jaao: dhonibhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni ne kaha ki unhone ballebaajon se kaha tha, 'target mat dekha, bas khelte jaao
 Shikhar Dhawan and Kohli's innings were excellent
 rohit ne ek badi pari kheli
 It was a good pitch for batting
 ham bowling main kamjor rahe
 Hard work is required in this area
 ' After filing a closure report in the cbi's Ghaziabad court, a big question has arisen as to what happened in the flat number L-32 of Climate Vihar on the night of 15 May 2008 from 12 to 6 pm, which led to the country's biggest murder mystery Gave birth to sibiai aarushi murder kii mistry ke saamne bebas mahasoos kar rahi
 The murder took place between 12 to 1 pm
 lekin rajesh talwaar danpati ne police ko 7 baje khabar di
 The CBI could not get a curtain on what happened in this house for six hours in the climate park
 sibiai kii closer report main 15 may 2008 kii raat ke sikvence main kaha gaya he


 −15 may ko saadhe nau baje rajesh talwaar ghar laute −isi din raat dow
 11 by Rajesh Talwar
 57 tak internet par kaam kiya
 - Aarushi and Hemraj were killed between 12 to 1 pm on 15 May 2008
 −phir 12 se 6 baje ke bich main aisa kya hua ki dow
 Rajesh Talwar did not get a clue and the two were murdered
 −subah chah baje naukaraani bharti ai
 Every day Hemraj used to open the door but that day Nupur herself brought the key
 bharti jab andar ai to usne dekha ki kamare main aarushi kii laash padi thi
 Then at 7:15, the police was informed but when the police talked about going to the roof of the house, instead of giving the keys, Rajesh Talwar asked Hemraj to search outside when there were blood stains on the stairs
 lekin, duusare din hemraj kii laash rajesh talwaar ke ghar kii chat se baraamad hui
 Due to the delay of the police, evidence could not be found from here
 to kya police kii jaanch main khami thi yaa phir qaatil itnaa chaalaak tha ki 12 se chah baje ke bich main usne katl ke har raaj ko khatm kar diya tha
 The CBI closure report gave clean chit to the three servants Krishna Rajkumar and Mandal
 isamen ye bhi kaha gaya he ki in teenon kii baat tak hemraj se us raat nahin hui thi
 Why the needle of suspicion of the CBI goes to the Talwar family
 indore ke rezart main dil dahala dene vaali vaardatsamuhik aatmahatya or hatya ke bich uljhi maut kii paheliindore ke ek aaleeshaan rezart main ek parivaar chhuttiyaan manaane aata he
 Spouse and two children
 tay vakt par puraa parivaar vahaan pahunch jaataa he
 On reaching the resort, all four go into the room and lock the door from inside
 5 ghante, 10 ghante, 20 ghante, yahaan tak ki 30 ghante biit jate hai
 No one comes out of the room nor does anyone go inside
 sivaae do bottle pani ke
 a whole family came to the resort for the holidays and came straight away to the room
 tees ghante se baahar naa niklaa ho to zaahir he hotel ke staff ko ajeeb lagegaa
 So the staff, after talking to the manager, decided to open room number 211 from the master key
 25 sitambar 2019, subah 11 bajeindore ke dibi city apartment se nikalakar ek car main devgudaaria pahaad ke neeche bane ek mashhoor rezart or spa ke liye nikalati he
 The car covers this journey of about 22 km in about 40 minutes
 car main pati, patni or do bachche maujuud the
 The car enters this resort at around quarter to 12
 rezart main check in karne ke baad puraa parivaar room number 211 main chalaa jaataa he or daravaaza band ho jaataa he
 The entire day of 25 September passes
 naa koi room se nikalataa he
 Nor does any order be made to the resort from the room
 25 sitambar 2019, raat 10 baje, kriscent rezart and spa, indoreroom number 211 se resepshan par phone aata he
 Two bottles of water are ordered from the front
 phir iske baad room number 211 se naa koi kol aati he
 Neither does anyone come out
 25 sitambar kii puri raat guzar jaati he
 On September 26, the buffet prepares for a breakfrost
 magar room number 211 se subah kaa naashtaa karne ke liye bhi koi baahar nahin aata he
 It is noon but still the door of the room remains closed
 ab rezart ke karmchaariyon kii bhi bechaini badhane lagati he
 Because 20 hours had passed
 naa koi kamare se baahar aayaa tha or naa hi koi kamare ke andar daakhil hua tha
 26 September 2019 at 6 pm, Crescent Resort & Spa, Indore Manager opened the room lock with the second key of the room
 rum number 211 kaa daravaaza jaise hi khulaa
 There was a restless view inside
 hotel ke staff kii ankhe khuli rah gayi
 Because there were 4 corpses lying in front of them
 ek kamare main pati-patni or duusare kamare main unke judawaan bachche
 There was foam from everyone's mouth
 or ye adhed umr insaan bed par aise leta hua tha
 As if thinking, it has breathed its last
 iske alaava isaki bivi or bacchon kii laashen bhi aisi sthiti main thim, jaise marane se pehle unhone koi tadpan mahasoos hi naa kii ho
 The bed sheets had not even shrunk
 yahaan tak ki sab ne baqayada blanket odha hua tha
 And that too was not removed
 kamare main mili chaar logon kii lashin chaaron laashon ke nazadik ek chaay kaa cap rakhaa hua tha
 And those two water bottles, which he had ordered by calling at the reception of the resort at 10 pm on 25 September
 jin chaar logon kii laashen kriscent rezart ke is room number 211 main thim
 Among them, 45-year-old software engineer Abhishek Saxena
 unki 42 saal kii patni priti
 Two twins named Aditi and Advik who were 14 years old
 laashon ko dekhne ke baad rezart prabandhan ne fouran police ko ittela di
 The police started investigating as soon as the news reached the resort with the police forensic team of Khudail police station
 maukey par pahunchakar bahut baariki se jaanch shuru kii gai
 Because there was neither an attempt to forcefully enter the room nor were there any signs of coercion with those who died
 ek parivaar ke saath amuman jo saamaan hote hai, vahi saamaan is parivaar ke paas bhi tha
 Except for those 2 things
 kisne lee chaaron kii janswaal ye tha ki aakhir wo do chizein thim kya
 Which surprised the police and the team of forensics
 wo kya chiz thi jisane in chaaron kii jaan le lee? aakhir cameraa number 211 main un 30 ghanton ke andar kya hua? harek laash kaa rang badal kar nila kyon ho gaya tha? amuman aisi maut kii misaal nahin milti, jab insaan bed par lete lete mar bhi rahaa ho or bistar par ek silawat bhi naa ai ho
 Two things found in 2 separate common room number 211 in the room surprised the police and forensic team
 wo thim vazan taulne kii ek choti si mashin or uske bagal main rakhaa hua sodium nitrate naam ke chemical kaa dibba
 The question was that what was the work of this chemical in the room of Abhishek Saxena who went out to have a picnic in this luxury resort
 kya kamare main koi aisa shaks daakhil hua tha
 Who fraudulently gave the family this deadly chemical and then quietly moved out of the room
 pani ke saath piya sodium nitretakmare main kisi or ke daakhil hone kii baat isliye bhi khaarij ho jaati he kyonki maukey se jo chaay ke cap mili hai
 The same sodium nitrate chemical was mixed with water rather than tea
 kamare main bhi jis tarah tamaam chizein tarateeb se rakhi hui hai, wo ishaara kar rahi thim ki ye maamla moss suicide yani samuhik khudakushi kaa he
 Everyone drank the death penalty, those who knew that they are going to drink, they will not survive after that
 magar phir bhi sabane us chemical ko gatak liya
 Just like 11 people had committed suicide in Burari, Delhi
 mumkin he ki buraadi kii tarah yahaan bhi parivaar ke mukhiya ne hi sabko khudakushi karne ke liye manaaya ho
 But the surprising thing is that what would he have said in such a way that everyone drank that jam of joyous death
 police ne mana khudakushimauka-e-vaardaat kaa haal dekhakar police ne ye maan liya ki maamla khudakushi kaa hi he
 And now she started searching for the cause of suicide
 magar ye samuhik khudakushi kyon
 This was a big question
 jiskaa jawaab talasha janaa zaruri tha
 Because the people whom Abhishek or Preity talked to before dying
 unki baatcheet se aisa laga hi nahin ki wo itnaa bada kadam uthaane ja rahe hai
 Why, when the collective self-help started the investigation, it was found that Abhishek Saxena was an experienced software engineer in a private company in Indore
 unki patni bhi naukari karti thim
 Children studied in good school
 or to or ye parivaar indore ke ek manhage apartment rahata tha
 So what happened to this family that forced them to go to Moss Suicide? naukari chale jane se pareshaan the pati-patnikmare main koi bhi suicide note nahin tha
 So that it can be clear why if this family committed suicide
 lekin jab police ne abhishek or uske parivaar kii jaankaree jutani shuru kar kii to pataa chalaa ki abhishek jis software company main senior post par the
 That company ended
 is tarah har maheene lakhon kii selary uthaane vaale abhishek ko pehla jhatka laga
 At the same time, his wife Preeti also used to be in the private company
 vahaan se unki bhi naukari chali gai thi
 Abhishek and his family's income were suddenly lost due to financial crisis
 magar kharche unke vaise hi bane hue the
 Abhishek had lost lakhs of rupees in share trading as well
 vahiin uske donon bachche lagaataar biimaar rah rahe the
 Money was also needed for his treatment
 kul milakar parivaar aarthik badahaali se guzar rahaa tha
 But because of shame, he never asked for money from his near ones
 bacchon par jaan chhidakta tha abhishekajo log abhishek ko jaanate hai, unhen pataa he ki wo apane bacchon par jaan chhidakte the
 He always kept them with him
 aise main abhishek ne apane is paagalpan main aakhir unhen kyon shaamil kiya
 This is a big question
 haalanki gharavaalon kaa kahana he ki mumkin he ki abhishek ko ye khyaal aayaa ho ki bachche unke bina nahin rah paaenge, isliye unhone apane bacchon ko bhi ye maut kaa jam pilaa diya
 Cyber team opens gadget haalanki abhishek ke jo bhi electranik gajet police ke haath lage hai wo password protected the
 But the police opened them and found out the real reason for the suicide
 internet par search kiya tha maut kaa samanpulice ne jab abhishek ke laptop ko khangala to pataa chalaa ki abhishek ne kuch din pehle hi internet par sodium nitrate naam ke rasayan ko search kiya tha
 That is, he had already decided how to commit suicide
 police kii maane to yahi chemical usne sabase pehle donon bacchon ko pani main mila kar diya
 After this, wife was given a drink and then in the end she also drank herself
 bujurg maa-baap par tutaa pahaad82 saal ke bujurg pita kaa dard unki ankhon se us vaqt foot padaa, jab unke saamne unke iklaute bete kii laash laai gai
 Then when they saw the body of daughter-in-law and grandchildren one by one, the heartbreak broke
 postmortem house ke saamne us maa ko apni ankhon par yakeen hi nahin ho rahaa tha ki palabar main unki duniya ujaad gai
 Those who call that old mother a mother
 daadi kehane vaale sab ke sab us duniya main chale gaye, jahaan se ab kabhi waapas nahin aaenge
 This story which ripped the heart, in which he also heard, his eyes were filled

 Now i am enjoying the whole process after the break
 pichley kuch saalon main aapane bollywood ke doston se baatcheet kii?maine kisi ke tach main nahin tha
 a few years ago i met Manisha Koirala and when Anupam Kher Sahab also comes to South, i have to meet him
 baaki zyada kisi se mil nahin paata
 Was it right to take such a big break after doing good films? See, i was the only boy in my house and had more responsibilities
 main khud ke saath kaaphi vakt bitaata hum
 My father was a businessman, before tenth, i wanted to become a doctor, but my father wanted me to get into business
 unhone mujhe commers ke subject dilaae
 So it happens that you want to get higher but something else happens

 Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, after marrying his childhood friend Sakshi Singh Rawat in Dehradun on Sunday, reached his home on Wednesday to welcome hundreds of supporters on the occasion of his 29th birthday
 dhoni or unki patni kaa unki maa or bahan ne aarti ke saath swaagat kiya
 Dhoni wore a pink t-shirt and black jeans while Sakshi wore a white salwar suit and a dhani-colored chunari
 ve hawaii adde se baari suraksha ke bich lalabatti lagi apni qualis gaadi main sidhe ghar pahunche
 Mother Devaki Devi and sister Jayanti descended the new bride Sakshi and Dhoni's Arti in the house and according to the tradition of Uttarakhand, the bride took the bride inside the house
 harmu road sthiti dhoni ke awaas ke baahar unki ek jhalak paane ke liye khadey saikadon prashansakon or darjanon mediakarmiyon ko ek baar phir niraashaa kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The Indian captain did not even see his glimpse at the airport
 dhoni kii gaadi unki suraksha main lagi payalat gaadi ke peeche peeche chalate hue sidhe ghar ke andar pravesh karne ke baad hi rukii
 Media personnel meanwhile climbed on the roof of the adjoining houses to take pictures of Dhoni and his family, but his family, regardless of this, performed all the rituals associated with the bride and groom's reception
 dhoni jis qualis gaadi main apni patni sakshi ke saath baithe the usamen unka saalaa akshay ravat bhi maujuud tha dhoni or sakshi kii ek jhalak paane ke liye subah se hi saikadon log unke ghar ke baahar jutane lage the jise dekhte hue suraksha ke jabardast intjaam kiye gayi the or kisi ko bhi unke ghar ke aasapaas fatakane kii ijaajat nahin thi
 Dhoni reached the terrace with his wife Sakshi at around two and a half hours after the ritual of welcoming the newcomer inside the house and from there, he showed his first glimpse after marriage to fans and media personnel standing outside the house
 chat se dhoni or sir par dupatta daale sakshi ne logon kaa haath hilaakar abhivan sweekaar kiya
 Dhoni, who arrived at his home in Ranchi for the first time with his wife, was shy in coming in front of people
 jaise hi unki patni ne logon ko apana dupatta thik karte hue didaar karaayaa, dhoni use lekar peeche mude or ghar main chale gayi
 Seeing their favorite Ranchi couple number one, people standing outside the house were making a sound of dhoni-dhoni
 logon ne jor-jor se aawaaj lagaakar dhoni ko janmdin kii shubhakamana di or ek baar phir baahar aane ko kaha lekin dhoni nahin aaye
 Dhoni got married on the very next day of engagement at the Visranti Resort near Dehradun in the presence of his select friends and relatives
 vivaah ke baad unke pita paan singh, maa devaki, bahan jayanti, jija gautam tathaa anya rishtedaar somvaar ko der shaam yahaan waapas aa gayi
 Dhoni and Sakshi stayed in Delhi after the wedding where they met Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi
 iske baad se unke janmdin par mumbai yaa ranchi main jashn ke kayaas lagaaye ja rahe the
 There were discussions to celebrate his birthday, sometimes in Mumbai and there was a lot of media confusion about it
 antat: buudhvaar ko jaise hi suraksha adhikariyon ko dhoni ke ranchi pahunchane kii khabar mili, unhone hawaii adde or iske aasapaas suraksha ke baari intjaam kar diye
 Dhoni and his wife were evacuated from the airport through the secret route, leaving the media untouched

 JNU historian Aditya Mukherjee believes that the Ramakrishna Mission, which was founded by Vivekananda with the inspiration of his guru Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, should strongly oppose the move in the same way as the legalist Nani Palkhiwala gave Vallabhbhai Patel in 1992
 bjp's attempt to portray himself as a fundamentalist was opposed, "vallabhbhai Patel as Home Minister praised RSS Had shown the courage to apply the smell

 "BJP leader Parendu Bhagat defends the Chief Minister, saying," Swamiji is no political tool for Modi

 janvari se hi gujarat swami vivekanand ke janm ke 150wein varsh ko yuva shakti varsh ke rup main manaa rahaa he

 Nusrat Jahan Karva Chauth: abhinetri se netaa baniin trinmul congress (TMC) saansad nusrat jahaan (nusrat Jahan) ne shaadi ke baad pehali baar karvaa chouth (karwa Chauth) kaa vrath rakhaa
 The 29-year-old MP shared pictures of Karva Chauth celebrations with husband Nikhil Jain on his Instagram story
 nusrat ne isi saal june main bijnesaman nikhil jain ke saath byaah rachaaya tha
 Let us tell you that on Thursday, Karva Chauth was celebrated across the country
 netaaon or celibrity se lekar aam logon tak ne puure vidhi-vidhaan is vrath ko sampann kiya
 It is believed that keeping a fast of Karva Chauth increases the life of the husband
 yahi nahin kunvaari ladkiyaan bhi is vrath ko rakhti hai
 It is said that due to the effect of this fast one gets a desired life partner
 karvaa chouth ke maukey par nusrat jahaan ne surkh laal rang kii sari pahani thi or solah shringaar kiya hua tha
 Seeing the picture, you can guess that Nusrat performed every ritual of Karva Chauth with the entire traditional law
 chand ko arghya dene ke baad nusrat jahaan ne pati nikhil jain ke haathon pani pikar apana vrath sampann kiya
 Seeing the picture, it seems that Nusrat's husband also fasted for him
 jahaan nusrat laal rang kii sari main najar ain, vahiin nikhil jain ne nile rang kaa kurta pahana hua tha
 Significantly, Nusrat has been a target of fundamentalists ever since he became an MP
 saansad banane ke baad jab unhone pehali baar sansad bhawan main shapath lee thi tab unhone spikar ke pair chhue the
 During that time she was dressed like a Hindu newly married woman
 lekin kattarpathiyon ko unka is tarah pair choona or maang bharna va mangalsutra pahananaa nahin bhaayaa
 Also read: mps Nusrat Jahan and Mimi Chakraborty dedicate something like this to Maa Durga
 After this, Nusrat also participated in a chariot trip to ISKCON temple in Kolkata, which was very furious
 haal hi main durga puja main unhone dhol bhi bajaayaa or jamkar naach bhi kiya tha
 When he was criticized for this, he said, "I am God's special child
 main insaaniyat or pyaar se upar kisi cheez kii izzat nahin karti
 i am very happy and i do not mind the controversies
 main sabhi dharmon kaa sammaan karti hum or sabhi tyoharon ko manaati hum
 " isisi cricket world ke duusare semifinal mukaable main australia or bharat aamane-saamne honge
 The match, played on 26 March at the Sydney Cricket Ground, can be seen to be a tremendous thrill
 bharat pichley saal november ke ant se hi australia main hi he
 Both teams have played each other in the Test and ODI series so far
 itane lambey daure ke baad donon timen ek duusare se puri tarah waakif hai
 Each player has a complete blueprint for the opposing team
 yani bharat ne bhi australia ke khilaaf ranneeti bana lee hogi
 But in a crucial match like semi-finals, a single mistake will show the way out of the World Cup
 aise main bharat ko in paanch baton kaa khaas khyaal rakhana hoga
 For these 5 reasons, we will be the 'wolf Pack' of heavy bowling on Kangaroos, although Australian players are called as Kangaroos, but this team's fast bowler is like 'wolf Pack'
 cricket kii shabdaawalee main ye gendbaaj virdohi ballebaajon kaa shikaar kisi 'woolf pack' kii tarah karte hai
 All-round attack
 mishael stark kii in swinging gendbaaji se batch gaye to mishael johnson kii raftaar or bounsar ke liye taiyaar rahiye
 If they overcome these two, then Josh Hazlewald's exact line-length bowling or Pat Cummins' pace bowling
 maan liya ki aapane in chaaron gendbaaj kaa kaat nikaal liya ab james foconor kii chaturaai bhari gendbaaji par kya karenge
 The most important thing is that all these bowlers can bowl at a speed of about 150 kilometers per hour
 yani kisi na kisi jaal main funs hi jaaenge
 World Cup semi-finals: People are making excuses for taking a break, the game is of runs and wickets, not of sledding
 Australian cricketer specializes in mind games
 sledging ke maamle main unsa koi nahin
 The match has not even started yet, but most Australian cricketers are rhetorical about sledging
 maujuuda team india ko dekhte hue yah bhi tay he ki ve sledging kaa jawaab sledging se hi denge
 That is, a tremendous tension can be seen on the field
 or kangaroo bhi yahi to chaahate hai
 He feels that this strategy brings out the best in him
 isliye bhartiya cricketron main is jaal main funsane se bachanaa hoga
 Because this match is about the ball and bat, not the sledding
 kisne kab slage kiya? kya use jawaab diya gaya? is tarah kii soch khilaadiyon kaa dhyaan cricket se dur kar sakati he jo semifinal jaise ahm mukaable main baari nuksaandeh he
 If India has to answer to Australia's sledding, then give it with bat and ball, then the result will go in your favor
 pich kii 'gugali'sidney kii pich ko lekar jabardast ho hallaa machaa he
 The kangaroos want the pitch to be helpful to their fast bowlers
 par curator ke bayaan se saaf he ki aisa hone kii sambhaavna behad kam he
 Experts say that this pitch will be slow and spin can benefit on it
 par yah bhi ek chhalaava sabit ho saktaa he
 Because even in the quarterfinal match played on this ground, the South African spin bowlers took 7 wickets against Sri Lanka
 par yah bhi satya hi he ki is maidan par westeindies ke khilaaf dakshin africa ne 400 se zyada ran banaae
 And both teams had scored over 300 runs in the match between the hosts and Sri Lanka
 agar team india spin ko madad dene vaali pich ummid lagaae baithi he to yah uske liye ghaatak sabit ho saktaa he
 Apart from this, there was rain in Sydney all day on Tuesday due to which the pitch remained covered
 yani is pich par utani dhoop nahin padi he jisaki ummid team india ko rahi hogi
 Thinking of 'spinner' Maxwell, most cricket experts believe that India's spin is heavy in the spin department
 chaahe baat spin gendbaajon kii ho yaa phir spin bowling khilne kii
 Cricket experts are assuming that India will dominate Australia under both circumstances
 vaise yah maanakar chalaa ja rahaa he ki australia apane plaing ilevan main badlaav nahin karegaa or glen maxwell part time spinner kii bhoomika main najar aaenge
 It will not be difficult for India to play Maxwell
 par yah ek penchida maamla he
 Maxwell is a spinner
 of spin gendbaaji ke saamne team india ke haalia pradarshan se har koi waakif he
 On the way to England tour, part-timer Moin Ali opened the bat of our batsmen
 use yadakar man main dar to bana hi rahegaa
 Ajinkya Rahane and Shikhar Dhawan often fell prey to Moin Ali
 cricket ke jaankaar maanate hai ki bharat ne moin ali ko halke main liya
 To overcome the pressure of good bowling at the other end, India attacked Moin more and as a result, he threw his wicket
 kuch aisa hi semifinal match me bhi ho saktaa he
 If Team India does not take precaution, then Maxwell's spin in the semi-finals can prove to be huge on India
 bounsar kaa lobhais world cap main bhartiya tej gendbaajon kii ranneeti ne sabko prabhavit kiya he
 They have managed to dominate the opposing batsman at their own pace, especially with the use of bouncers, most experts are surprised
 record bataate hai is world cap main bharat ne kareeb 25 wicket short gendon se lee he
 Melbourne Cricket Ground's long boundary and Perth's bouncy pitch also contributed to this
 par esasiji main naa to boundry itani lambii he or naa hi yahaan kii pich main perth jaisi oochaal
 Apart from this, the way Pakistan has upset the Australian batsmen by putting a bouncer in the quarter-finals match, may tempt India to adopt a bouncer strategy
 magar team india ko yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki kangaroo apane ghar main bounsi wicket par khilne ke aadi hai
 If we remember the Test series against Australia, we lost the Bisbane Test because of our bouncer strategy
 mishael johnson ke bounsar daalane kii ranneeti apanaai or badale main jamkar ran lutaae
 There is nothing wrong in testing a batsman by hitting a bouncer but relying too much on this strategy can create problems for India
 bharat or dakshin africa ke bich maujuuda vanade siries kaa antim or nirnaayak vanade mumbai ke vankhede stadium main khelaa jayega
 This ground has been lucky for Team India and Dhoni
 yah vahi maidan he jahaan dhoni kii captaini main team india ne 28 saal baad world cap jeetne kaa karishma dikhaaya tha
 India has played 16 matches so far in this ground, in which the team has managed to win 10 matches
 dakshin africa ke khilaaf is maidan main team india ne 3 match khele hai or teenon match bharat ne jite hai
 From this perspective, the figures are in favor of Dhoni
 pich se spinneron ko zyaada madad milane kii ummid he, lekin shuruaati overon main tej gendbaazon ko bhi phayda milegaa
 In this context, the role of the toss will also be important, although there will be a chance for the team to bat before and after this field
 is maidan par ab tak 19 match khele gaye hai, 10 main pehle ballebaazi karne vaali team ko jeet mili he to 9 main baad main khilne vaali team jiti he
 That is, in this case, the team playing later than the team playing earlier will be equally likely to win
 vaise team india agar ye muqaabala jeet leti he to chaar saal ke baad dakshin africa se vanade series jeetegi
 The comments vaise vanade captain emes dhoni ke liye vankhede stadium main khelaa jane vaala muqaabala behad ahm hoga
 In this series, Dhoni has seen that after a defeat, his captaincy is being questioned
 team main unki jagah par bhi sawaal puche jane lage hai haalanki dhoni ne iskaa bakhubi jabaav de diya he, lekin vanade series harkar ve ek baar phir aalochakon ko koi mauka nahin dena chahenge
 In such a situation, Dhoni would like to adopt all his tricks for this match, on the other hand, under the captaincy of AB de Villiers, the visiting team would like to boost their morale before the Test series, so the audience can get to see an exciting match
 bharat ne is maidan main ab tak 16 match khele hai, isamen team 10 match jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 Team India has played 3 matches in this ground against South Africa and India has won all the three matches
 is lihaaj se dekhen to aankade dhoni ke paksh main hai
 The pitch is expected to help the spinners more, but the fast bowlers will also benefit in the early overs
 is lihaaj se toss kii bhoomika bhi ahm hogi, haalanki is maidan par pehle or baad main ballebaazi karne vaali team ke liye barabari kaa mauka hoga
 So far, 19 matches have been played on this ground, the team batting first in 10 wins, and the team playing in 9 wins
 yani is muqaabale main pehle khilne vaali team kii tulana main baad main khilne vaali team bhi jeet kii utani hi daavedaar hogi
 By the way, if Team India wins this match then after four years, they will win the ODI series from South Africa
 tippaniyan However, for ODI captain MS Dhoni, the match played at the Wankhede Stadium will be very important
 isi siries main dhoni ye dekh chuke hai ek haar ke baad unki captaini par sawaal uth rahe hai
 Questions have also been asked on his place in the team, although Dhoni has responded well to this, but after losing the ODI series, he would not like to give critics any chance again
 aise main dhoni is muqaabale ke liye apni har tarkeeb apnaanaa chahenge vahiin duusari ore abi divilliars kii captaini main mehmaan team test series se pehle apana manobal badhanaa chaahegi, lihaaja darshakon ko ek romaanchak muqaabala dekhne ko mil saktaa he
 From this perspective, the figures are in favor of Dhoni

 Although the politics of Bihar changes its color every step, the year 2018 was slightly different than other years
 yahaan kii siyasat main na sirf raajnneetik chhaunk dikhaa, balki paariwarik kalah bhi khulkar saamne ai
 Actually, the year 2018 in Bihar will be remembered as a political scandal
 2018 ke shuruyaat se hi jo nae siyaasi sameekaran banane-bigadane kaa khel shuru hua, vah saal ke ant tak jari rahaa, jisaki vajab se kai puraane siyaasi dost dushman ban gaye, jabaki kai siyaasi dushman galabahia karte najar aa aae
 In such a situation, the political equations of the past year also made headlines in the country
 yah saal na keval siyaasi samikarnon ke ulatpher ke liye yaad kiya jayega, balki is ek saal main raajnneetik dosti ke pariwarik sambandh banane or uske tuutane kii kavayad ke rup main bhi yaad kiya jayega
 Earlier this year, in a setback to the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar, Hindustan Awam Morcha (ham) leader and former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi left the NDA
 ve rajd or congress ke gathbandhan main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Jitan Ram Manjhi had formed his own party Hindustani Awam Morcha after his displeasure with Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and joined the NDA
 vaise, gaur se dekha jaae to bihar main yah ek saal rajg ke liye shubh sabit nahin hua
 This is how the NDA government continued to run in Bihar, but its friends continued to leave them
 saal ke prathamardh main agar maanjhi rashtriya janata dal (rajd) nit mahagathbandhan ke saath ho liye to saal ke uttarardh main rajg ke saath lanbaa safar tay kiye kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha kii party rashtriya lok samta party (ralospa) ne bhi rajg se baahar hone kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Kushwaha not only resigned the post of Union Minister, but also announced his joining the grand alliance of anti-nda camp
 kushvaha pehle se hi loksabhaa seat bantwaare ko lekar tarjeeh nahin die jane se naaraaz chal rahe the, parantu unhone rajg main sammaan nahin die jane kaa aarope laagate hue rajg kaa saath chhod diya
 By the way, Kushwaha was feeling uneasy in NDA since Nitish Kumar's JD (U) joined the NDA
 aise main bhaajapa dwaara jad (you) ke saath seat bantwaare kii charchaa karnaa ralospa ko raas nahin aayaa or kushvaha ne rajg se alag raah pakad lee
 Mukesh Sahni, who was considered close to BJP President Amit Shah at the end of the year and had supported the NDA in the last Lok Sabha election, also gave a shock to the NDA by announcing his entry into the grand alliance
 'san of mallaah' ke naam se charchit mukesh sahani ko prarambh se hi bhaajapa ke saath mana ja rahaa tha, magar saal ke ant main is siyaasi ghatana ko bihar kii raajnneeti main bada ultpher mana ja rahaa he
 By the way, in the headlines of Bihar this year, there was also the marriage of Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former Chief Minister Daroga Rai and son of RJD president Lalu Prasad and former state health minister Tej Pratap Yadav
 is shaadi ke baad bihar ke do raajnneetik pariwaron ke bich paariwarik sambandh ban gaye
 What could have saved Kisan Gajendra Singh, who committed suicide at an Aam Aadmi Party rally? This question is arising because a crowd of hundreds of people were watching Gajendra climbing the tree at Jantar Mantar, but no one dared to try to save him
 maano sab sanvadena shunya ho gaye ho
 It is believed that one does not die for 1 minute after hanging
 agar koshish kii jaae to use bachaaya ja saktaa he, tab jab aap use dekh rahe ho, wo aapke saamne ped par khadaa ho, lekin dilli main khadey log tamaashe kii tarahagajendra sinhako dekhte rahe?duusari ore aam aadmi party ke netakisaan ralimein bhaashan dete rahe
 Farmers at Gajendra Singhpeed, some distance away from the stage, continued to threaten suicide and no one tried to save them
 desh ko yah jaananaa chahie ki jis jagah par khudakushi hui agaraam aadmi partike manch se koi bhi shaks neeche utarataa or us ped tak aane kii koshish karata kitne second lagate
 It was possible that if Kejriwal or anyone went and talked to him, perhaps the situation could have been different
 video main dekhie ki kaise agar koshish hui hoti to kisaan gajendra singh tak pahunchane main kuch second lagate or bachaaya ja saktaa tha

 The fire is estimated to result in a loss of five crore rupees
 unhone kaha ki baharhaal multiplex main or kisi ke hataahat hone kii koi khabar nahin he
 There are four theaters in this multiplex

 Officials from Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BASCOM) along with forensic experts have reached the spot
 reddy ne kaha aag lagane ke kaaran kaa pataa lagaaya janaa baaki he
 The soldiers who protect the country all the time by putting their lives on the outskirts are now becoming victims of fraud
 thagi bhi aisi jiskaa koi suraag nahin
 Some similar incidents of cheating jawans have come up in the capital Delhi
 jisaki padtaal karte vakt police ke bhi hosh ud gaye hai
 The police is currently investigating the matter closely
 sena ke afasaron, javaanon ko banaaya nishanarajadhani dilli main sena ke javaanon or adhikariyon kothgejane kii ek nahin, do nahin balki kai vaaradaaten saamne ai hai
 In the initial investigation of the police, a 'skimmer gang' cheating the jawans has been revealed
 darasal, kuch vakt se dilli police ko bhartiya sena ke afasaron se lekar javaanon tak ke saath hui dhokhadhadi kii kai shikaayatein mili hai
 In which someone is clearing their hard earned money from their bank account
 unhen is baat kaa pataa tab chalata he, jab ve apana acount statement nikalavaate hai
 In a moment of hard work, a soldier of the army, Vijay, also complained about the fraud that happened to him at the Delhi Cantt police station
 vijay ne bataaya ki wo pichley 9 saalon se desh kii seva kar rahe hai
 During this, he had saved nearly two lakh rupees in his salary account by adding one rupee each
 1 july ko jab wo apane acount se paise nikaalane gaye to unke pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 Someone had cleared their hands on their hard-earned money
 jabaki vijay kaa atm card unke paas hi tha
 When the police started investigating this matter, it was found that not only Vijay but the same has happened with many army officers and soldiers
 padtaal aage badi to police ke bhi hosh phakhta ho gaye
 Actually, on the night of 24-25 June, money was withdrawn from Vijay's account
 police ne sisitivi footage dekha to usamen do sandigdh najar aae
 The surprising thing was that he had Vijay's ATM card with him, so how did these two men withdraw money from Vijay's account
 mahange hotalon main khaaya khaanaa or kii shoppingbadmaashon ne vijay or baaki javaanon ke paison se mahange hotalon main khaanaa khaaya or khariddaari bhi kii thi
 There were many questions before the police in this whole case
 aakhir donon badmaashon ne bina atm card churaae kaise afasaron or javaanon ke saath is vaardaat ko anjaam diya
 Why did they not come to know about every transaction
 saath hi ye giroh aakhir bhartiya sainikon ke hi peeche kyon padaa he
 Use of 'skimmer device' for the incident As the police investigation progressed, the police came to know that these miscreants had installed a 'skimmer device' at an ATM in Delhi Cantt
 'skimar divaais' ek aisa electronic divaais hota jo bilkul atm ke bheetar card incert mashin kii tarah dikhataa he
 This device is mounted on the card insert machine of the ATM
 iske baad jaise hi koi apana card isamen daalata he to ye 'skimar divaais' us card kii jaankaree seve kar letaa he
 In addition, the crooks also put a hidden camera inside the ATM so that they also see the password
 aakhir sena ke jawan hi kyunusi jaankaree kaa istemaal kar ye 'skimar gang' nae atm card bana letaa he
 Then withdraw cash from those ATM cards or go shopping
 sawaal ye bhi uthta he ki har tranjaction ke baad javaanon ko uskaa massej kyon nahin miltaa
 Actually, the places of transfer and posting in army jobs keep changing
 aksar jahaan unki posting hoti he yaa to vahaan signal nahin aate he yaa phir suraksha kaarnon se wo mobile apane saath nahin rakh pate
 Taking advantage of this, this gang is targeting army soldiers
 ab police ke saamne sabase badi chunauti in badmaashon ko salaakhon ke peeche daalane kii he
 Police are currently on a rampage in search of suspected faces found from CCTV footage
 saath hi police is 'skimar gang' ke network ko sir uthaane se pehle hi dhwast karne kii baat kahati najar aa rahi he
 If you are going to eat outside then after the meal the waiter will surely give you a toothpick
 ab to gharon main bhi tuthpik kaa istemaal kiya jane laga he
 a toothpick is used to remove food fragments and fibers stuck between the teeth
 lekin kai baar isaki nok se masoode ghayal ho jate hai
 In such cases, natural measures can also remove the pieces stuck between the teeth
 in natural chizon ke istemaal se na to masoodon ke ghayal hone kaa dar hota he or na hi kisi tarah ke chemical said-effect kaa khatra rahata he
 And a special thing is that many problems related to these mouths are also solved
 1
 Curry leaf stalk tree is very easy to find
 usamen se ek patali tahani todakar uski sari pattiyon ko hataa den
 Dip this stalk in honey and keep it for a day or two
 tab tak aapke liye ek badhiya tuthpik taiyaar ho jaaegi
 2

 In view of the tremendous shortage in the supply of cash, banks do not understand how to meet the legitimate demand of the people
 aise main ye khabar bainkon or aamajanon, donon ke liye ek tarah se raahat bhari ho sakati he

 iske liye 500 rupee ke note arabiai zyada chhaapegi
 Let us tell you that more than two-thirds of atms have already been calibrated by banks
 atm ke baahar nahin kam ho rahi katarisch ye he ki rigerv bank of india ke tamaam daavon ke baad bhi bainkon or atm ke baahar qatari kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi
 People queuing outside the banks say that the bank employees distribute the tokens at 10 am after being in line since morning
 amuman 100 logon ko token miltaa he, lekin pratidin in 100 logon ko bhi cash milane kii guarantee nahin hoti
 At the new Bamboo Central Bank of India branch in Noida, we met an elderly man who has to get his granddaughter to do the operation and has been circling the bank for cash for the last three times
 bank managerase baat karne par unhone bhi mahaj takalif hi jaahir kii or kaha ki hamen cash peeche se mili to ham aage den
 Overall, cash crunch and demonetisation is proving to be no less than a vicious cycle for a section of society
 20 lakh main kisko kya baantenin dinon bainkon ke halaat ye hai ki jin bainkon main cash he vahaan sarwar down kaa board laga he or jahaan sarwar durust he vahaan cash gaayab he
 As far as the rules are concerned, according to the rules, people can withdraw up to 24 thousand from their accounts every week, but sources associated with the bank say that even in urban areas, most bank branches are not reaching more than twenty lakhs per day
 aise membankkya to jaruratmand logon ko cash baanten or kya naukareepesha kii selary

 Senior leader Venkaiah Naidu, who came to take a meeting of party workers, has been attacked through a prescription
 is parche main unki netritv kshamta par hi sawaal uthaae gaye hai
 After the formation of the new executive, Tomar convened the first meeting of party officials from the state to the district level in the presence of senior leader Venkaiah Naidu
 naidu ke baithak main pahunchane se pehle guuruuvaar ko hi ek vivaadit parchaa baanta gaya
 This pamphlet states that in 1993, Naidu's home state Andhra Pradesh had 34 BJP mlas and today there is not one
 20 varshon me andhrapradesh main bhaajapa kii haalat aisi kyon hui ki ek bhi vidhayak nahin he
 The pamphlet further states that Naidu's nephew lost badly in the Municipal Corporation elections in Bangalore from the same ward where he is home
 ant main sawaal kiya gaya he ki jo swayan ke pradesh main ek bhi vidhayak nahin jita paata, use duusare rajya main chunaav tips dene kaa kya adhikaar he
 Internal change has been taking place since the change in the bjp's organization in the state, the leaders tried to get a place in the executive committee formed by the first new president Narendra Singh Tomar
 jo sthaan paa gaye ve khush hai, or jinhen jagah nahin mili ve asantushton kii qatari main khadey najar aa rahe hai
 Party leaders do not miss out on attacks in gestures
 baat tomars kii tajposhi ke kaarykram kii karen to tab nivartmaan adhyaksh prabhaat jha ne aparoksh rup se mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan par hamalaa bolaa tha
 He compared his removal from the post of president with the Pokhran blast
 kathith taur par bhaajapa ke ek kaaryakarta ke dwaara baante gaye parche ne party main bhitari taur par chal rahi kalah ko saamne laa diya he
 The potential impact of Naidu's growing influence in Madhya Pradesh is already being seen as an attempt to stop him
 nitin gadakari ke kaarykaal main rajya main anant kumaar kaa dabadabaa chalata tha, magar ab rajnath singh ke rashtriya adhyaksh banane ke baad naidu kaa prabhaav badhane kii kavayad chal rahi he
 The state president Tomar termed this pamphlet as a juggernaut of cheap popularity and said that it is the work of outsider, not party worker
 vahiin jaankaron kaa kahana he ki bhaajapa main rashtriya str se lekar rajya str tak andruni kalah charam par he or koi bhi ek duusare par hamale kaa mauka haath se jane nahin dena chahta
 This is the reason why Venkaiah came to Madhya Pradesh and was attacked with a prescription

 He is not his own son, but Shivagami never let anything fall in love
 balki apane pati bijjaldev kii baton ko bhi apni mamata par haaavee nahin hone diya
 Not only this, when Sivagami Nebahubali was found more worthy than his son, he followed the promise of governance in giving responsibility for the state
 shivgami ne bahubali ko janm nahin diya tha, phir bhi jaisaa pyaar unhone amarendra ko diya- usase unki tulana yashoda maa se kii ja sakati he
 It seems that the glimpse of Kaikeyi is not only Bhima Mahabharata but the memory of Ramayana also gives the character of Shivgami

 And she entrusts the throne to her son in place of Amarendra Bahubali before the coronation

 Rajan also questioned the role of the PMO and said that the interference of the PMO in many decisions in India is one of the many problems
 rigerv bank ke purv governor raghuram rajan ne notebandi or maal evam seva kar (jiesti) ko desh kii aarthik vruddhi kii raah main aane vaali aisi do badi aadchan bataaya jisane pichley saal vruddhi kii raftaar ko prabhavit kiya

 In the second Bhattacharya lecture on the future of India, Rajan said that demonetisation and two consecutive tremors of GST severely impacted the country's economic growth
 desh kii vruddhi dar aise samay main girane lag gai jab vaishvik aarthik vruddhi dar gati pakad rahi thi
 The current growth pace Nakafirajan said that the economic growth rate of seven percent for 25 years is a very strong growth but in some ways it has become the new normal rate of growth for India which was earlier three and a half percent
 unhone kaha ki sach yah he ki jis tarah ke log shram bazaar se jud rahe hai, unke liye saat pratishat paryaapt nahin he
 We need to create more jobs
 ham is str par santusht nahin ho sakate hai
 The pace of growth was low in 2017 due to two aftershocks, acknowledging that India is sensitive to global growth and said that India is now a very open economy
 yadi vishwa vruddhi karata he to bharat bhi vruddhi karata he
 He said that it was in 2017 that even after catching up with the pace of world growth, India slowed down
 isse pataa chalata he ki in jhatkon (notebandi or jiesti) vastav main gahare jatke the
 Due to these tremors, we had to shiver

 The former governor said that the situation will be a bit difficult for the domestic economy due to rising crude oil prices, even if the country is recovering from the restrictions of demonetisation and GST
 badhate enpie ke bare main unhone kaha ki aisi sthiti ko saaf suthri bananaa hi behatar hoga
 Rajan said that it is necessary to deal with bad things, so that the balance sheet is clean and the banks can get back on track
 bharat ko bainkon ko saaf karne main lanbaa vakt laga he iskaa aanshik kaaran he ki pranali ke paas bure rin se nipatane ke saadhan nahin the
 Needing 10 lakh jobs every month, Rajan said that the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Disability Code cannot alone be able to keep banks' accounts clean
 unhone kaha ki yah is tarah kii safai kii badi yojana kaa ek tatv bhar he
 There is a need to adopt a multi-layered approach to deal with the challenge of npas in the country
 unhone kaha ki yadi ham saat pratishat se kam dar se vruddhi karte hai to nishchit taur par kuch gadabadiyaan hai
 He said that India will have to grow on this basis for at least the next 10-15 years
 unhone kaha ki bharat ko shram bal se jud rahe naye logon ke liye prati maah 10 lakh rojgaar ke avasar srujit karne kii jarurat he
 Rajan said that there are three problems before the country
 pehali dikkat ubad-khabad buniyadi sanrachana he
 He said that construction is the industry that drives the economy at an early stage
 uske baad buniyadi sanrachana se vruddhi kaa srijan hota he
 The second short-term goal, he said, may be to improve the state of the power sector
 yah sunishchit kiya janaa chaiye ki salanaa utpann bijli unke paas pahunche jinhen isaki jarurat he
 The third issue is to make banks' loan accounts clean and tidy
 piemo par bhi saadhaa nishanarajan ne kaha ki bharat main samasya kaa ek hissaa yah he ki vahaan raajnneetik nirnay lene kii vyavastha had se adhik kendrikrut he
 Rajan said that India cannot work from the center
 bharat tab kaam karata he jab kai log boj uthaa rahe hon
 In today's time, the central government is highly centralized
 unhone kaha, iskaa ek udhaaharan he ki bahut saare nirnay ke liye pradhanmantri karyaalay kii sahmati aavashyak he
 In this regard, Rajan, while referring to the statue of Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel, pointed to the need for consent of the Prime Minister's Office in big projects

 kamaal patil ko bataate hai ki rain baar, juhu chalanaa he
 According to Ravindra Patil's statement to the police, Salman drives in a white Toyota Land Cruiser car himself and then the three reach Juhu
 rain baar ke manager rigwan rakhaangi ke mutabik us raat baar main bahut saare celeberreties the
 In Salman's hand, he saw a glass of white color with something like white liquid
 rigwan ke mutabik salmaan or unke doston ne foster bear, cosmopotilan cocktail, white bacardi ram or snacks ke order die the jiskaa kul bill kareeb das hajaar rupye tha
 After leaving the Rain Bar, Salman goes to the Hotel JW Marriott for a while and then the three go home late at night
 maine us raat pani piya tha: salamanraat teen baje ke baad salmaan party se baahar nikalate hai
 The government lawyer says that he was drunk but Salaman Khan says that he only drank water in the bar that night
 ghar jane ke liye unke paas us raat safed rang kii toyta land kruger gaadi thi
 Along with driving the bodyguard less driver
 tadake kareeb 3 baje, american express bekri hill road, bandrasalman kii gaadi raat ke andhere main kareeb teen baje bandra ke hill road par pahunchati he
 The train was extremely fast, so suddenly before the American Express Bakery on Hill Road, the driver suddenly lost the balance of the vehicle and in a moment the car left the road from the left side and started running on the pavement
 badanasibi se us vakt usee footpath par american express bekri main kaam karne vaale paanch karmchaaree so rahe the
 The high speed land cruiser overtakes the five and then the car stops after hitting the shutter of the shop
 gaadi chhodkar maukey se gaayab ho jate hai salmanpulice ke mutabik haadase ke baad salmaan khan achaanak ghabara jate hai
 The rest of the people sleeping around wake up after hitting the pavement of the car and hearing the shouts of the injured
 log gaadi ke neeche fanse logon ko baahar niklaate hai or unhen aspataal le jaaya jaataa he
 After some time Salman disappears leaving the vehicle on the spot but even with a 70 mm screen, a glimpse of his height is enough to identify him
 bhaagane se pehle salmaan ko kai log pahchaan chuke the
 Death of one In four severely wounded, one worker dies on the spot almost on the spot, while four workers are badly injured
 chaaron main se zyaadaatar ke pair ko gaadi ne rond daalaa tha
 Muslim Niamat Sheikh, one of the four injured, had initially told the police that he was sleeping at the time of the accident, when a loud weight hit his left leg, which opened his eyes
 shaikh ne bataaya ki usne salmaan khan ko gaadi ke daahine daravaaje yani driver kii seat se neeche utarate dekha tha magar baad main magistrate court main shaikh ne kaha ki usne driver kii seat se salmaan ko utarate nahin dekha tha
 It had spread like a fire, the news of the accident did not take long to spread the news of the accident, but Salman had disappeared from the spot after the accident, when the police reached home, they could not even meet at home
 lekin salmaan, salmaan khan the chhupana mushkil tha lihaaza kareeb aath ghante baad wo khud saamne aa jate hai
 However, the Bombay High Court in its judgment has justified Salman's escape from the scene
 subah hote-hote puri mumbai main khabar fail chuki thi
 Salman Khan had another stain on his son, but Salman himself was missing since the accident
 lekin gaadi kaa number auki chashmadid salmaan ke khilaaf chugali kha chuke the
 So in the morning the police arrive at Salman's house but Salman was not at home
 pehali baar badra police ne salmaan ko kiya arestadrasal salmaan khan kanoonee salaah ke liye kuch vakt chaahate the
 That's why he was missing, but he knew that running too late could increase the odds
 zamaanat milane main dikkat aegi
 So, about eight hours after the accident, he himself comes forward and finally the Bandra Police Police arrest him
 giraftaar ke baad baad salmaan ko jeje aspatal le jaaya jaataa he
 Where Salman's blood sample is taken
 salmaan par gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukadmaa darj kii uthi mangasalaman ke khilaaf police laaparvaahee or khatarnaak dhang se gaadi chalaane kaa maamla darj kar leti he
 He is also released on bail shortly after arrest due to non-bailable section with a fine of only Rs 950
 salmaan kii itani aasaani rihaai kaa kuch saamaajik sanghathan viredh karte hai or paanch aktubar 2002 ko adaalat pahunchate jate hai
 They file a public interest litigation against Salman in the court and demand a non-willful murder case against Salman
 24 aktubar 2002 ko salmaan ko milti he jamaanandaalat naa sirf yachika manjuur kar leti he balki police ko salmaan ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 304-2 yani gaiyr iradatan hatya kaa mukadmaa darj karne kaa hukum detii he
 The maximum punishment under this is ten years imprisonment
 adalati aadesh milte hi police 7 aktubar 2002 ko gaiyr iradatan hatya ke jurm main salmaan ko phir se giraftaar kar leti he
 Salman goes to jail
 wo puure 18 dinon tak jail main rahete hai
 During this time, they apply for bail four times
 magar chaaron baar jamaanat kii arji khaarij ho jaati he
 Then 18 days later, on 24 October 2002, Salman gets bail and is released
 salmaan ko pehali badi raahat bombai hai court serihai ke baad salmaan khan march 2003 main mumbai sesham court main unke khilaaf gaiyr idathan hatya kaa maamla darj karne ke faisle ko chunauti dete hai, lekin do maheene ke andar hi may 2003 main seshans court naa sirf unki arji ko khaarij kar detii he balki magistrate court ko salmaan ke khilaaf chargeshit taiyaar karne kaa hukum suna detii he
 Salman continued the legal battle
 khud par lage gaiyr iradatan hatya kii dhara hatwane ke liye wo seshans court ke faisle ko ab bombai hai court main chunauti dete hai
 In this case Salman gets first relief here
 bombai hai court ipisi kii dhara 304 hataa detii he
 The court said that this section does not fit in this case
 supreme court ne bombai hai court ke faisle ko palatalekin salmaan ke hisse ye khushi behad kam ke liye ai, kroonki bombai hai court ke faisle ke khilaaf aktubar 2003 main maharashtra sarkaar supreme court pahunch gai
 He argued that the case was a case of culpable homicide
 do maheene ke intjaar ke baad disambar 2003 main supreme court se salmaan khan ko sabase bada jhatka mila
 The Supreme Court, while ruling the Bombay High Court judgment, said that Salman will be tried for non-willful murder or not, the magistrate court will decide
 ab chunki magistrate court pehle hi police se ipisi kii dhara 304-2 ke tahat salmaan ke khilaaf chargeshit daayar karne kaa hukum suna chuki thi lihaaza ab bas trial shuru hona baaki tha
 The Mumbai Police registers a case against Salman Khan under Section 304 (II) of the IPC under the Mater Vehicles Act 1988 and the Bombay Prohibition Act 1949 under Sections 279, 337, 338 and 427
 chargeshit main salmaan ke khilaaf chaar iljaamchargeshit main salmaan khan ke khilaaf chaar bade ilzaam lagaae jaate hai
 First, at the time of the accident, Salman Khan was driving a Toyota Land Cruiser car
 doosraa, salmaan kii car kii raftaar behad tej thi
 Third, Salman had escaped from the scene after the accident and the fourth that night Salman had drunk more than the usual amount
 inamen se zyaadaatar iljaam salmaan ke suraksha guard or mumbai police ke sipaahi rabindra patil ke bayaan ke aadhaar par hi lagaae gaye the
 Patil was the first to give a statement to the police that Salman was drunk after leaving the bar and after refusing, he was driving the same vehicle and the speed of the car was also around 90 to 100 kilometer per hour
 magar salmaan khan kii taraf se court main kaha gaya ki jis raat haadasa hua tha rabindra patil puure raste car main so rahaa tha
 He did not know anything
 rabindra patil ne apane pehle bayaan main police ko ye bhi nahin kaha tha ki haadase vaali raat salmaan nashe main the, balki ye baat usne chaar maheene baad kahi
 The case continued in the court after the filing of several diversion sheets in the case
 is dauraan cese main kai mode aate hai
 First of all it is said from Salman that he was not driving that night
 balki gaadi unka driver ashok singh chalaa rahaa tha
 Salman also denied drinking alcohol
 saath hi bhi ilzaam lagaava ki unka blad sample jaanboojh kar badal diya gaya tha
 JJ Hospital doctor Shashikant Pawar had said in an opening statement that Salman had earlier refused to give his blood sample, but his mouth smelled of alcohol
 baad main magistrate ke saamne doctor shashikant ne kaha ki ye kahana mushkil he ki salmaan ke munh se bu shayaab kii hi aa rahi thi
 As far as the blood sample was concerned, Salman's lawyer said that the sample has been tampered with
 daleel ye di gai ki us din do alag-alag blad sample kii shishi lab bheji gai thi par unpar naam kaa chit nahin laga tha
 Shocking turn came from the statement of Ashok Singh a total of 28 witnesses appeared in this case but only one of these witnesses was from Salman Khan, driver Ashok Singh, the remaining 27 witnesses testified against Salman on behalf of the prosecution, many of these witnesses There were ace who later overturned
 bambai hai court ne isiilie gavaahon kii gavaahiyon par yakeen nahin kiya
 The most important and shocking turn of this case came when the debate and arguments in the court was now going to end, then on 20 April 2015, suddenly a person named Ashok Singh arrives in the court
 wo khud ko salmaan khan or unke walid saleem khan kaa driver bataata he
 According to Ashok Singh's statement in the court, he has been the driver of the Khan family since 1990, Ashok Singh said that on the night of September 28, he was driving the Land Cruiser, not Salman Khan
 adaalat ne salmaan se puche 419 sawalis par jab adaalat ne usase poocha ki ye baat 13 saal baad ab kiyon bataa rahaa he to ashok singh kaa kahana tha ki us raat car kaa ek pahiyaa fat gaya tha jisaki vajah se gaadi kaa santul bighad gadha or wo footpath par chadh gaya
 After this, at the behest of Salman, he called the police at number 100, then from there he went to the Bandra police station where he stayed till four o'clock in the morning and he had told the police everything that night
 trial ke dauraan salmaan khan se adaalat ne kul 419 sawaal puche the
 The questions varied of course
 par salmaan khan aakhir tak adaalat ko yahi yakeen dilaate rahe ki us raat naa to unhone sharaab pi thi naa hi wo gaadi chalaa rahe the or naa hi unke haathon koi haadasa hua kyonki gaadi unka driver ashok singh chalaa rahaa tha
 'it does not prove that Salman was driving the car', but the Bombay Judge and Civil Sessions Court Judge DW Deshpande, on 6 May, at half past one in the day, disregarded all the arguments of Salman for the American Bakery Hit and Run case
 Convicted 5 years in prison and ordered a fine of 25,000 rupees
 isi faisle ko salmaan ne bombai hai court main chunauti di thi
 And finally after 13 years, the biggest decision came in Salman's favor
 puraa cese jis ek sabase ahm gavaah yani consteble rabindra patil ke bayaan par khadaa tha hai court ne usee rabindra patil ke bayaan ko bharose laayak nahin mana
 It also said that the witness and the evidence did not match
 ye sabit nahin hota ki us raat car salmaan hi chalaa rahe the
 That is why in the lack of evidence, he is acquitted of all the allegations, giving the benefit of doubt

 After this, the Civil Court prohibited him from doing anything there
 vakil ne adaalat ko bataaya ki court ne ramajnmabhumi ko muddai maanane se inkaar kar diya tha, isliye ramalala ko pakshakaar bananaa padaa

 Sharad Pawar met with Sonia on Monday, not clear on the political situation in Maharashtra, who will form the government in Maharashtra? Will NCP and Congress support Shiv Sena for Chief Minister's post? This question is in everyone's mind amidst the ongoing churn on forming a government in Maharashtra

 donon partiyon ne saath main chunaav ladaa tha, isliye sirf maharashtra kii raajnneetik paristhiti par charchaa kii gai he

 Now whatsapp's head has been placed in India, so hopefully whatsapp works on this new feature

 diarector niraj pandeya mahendra singh dhoni par film bana rahe hai lekin film main sakshi ke kirdaar ke liye kisi actress kaa naam final nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 Now the name of Actress has been finalized for the film
 ab film mensushant singh rajputke apojit sakshi kaa kirdaar nibhaati hui kiyaara adwani najar aaengi
 Sources attached to the film say, 'it was a difficult task to choose the right choice for the role of Sakshi because obviously people will compare
 diarector yuva cheharaa chaahate the, jisane zyada filmein na kii hon
 Kiara's audition was very good

 Kiara is rehearsing for her role and sweating profusely
 ' film'emes dhonih da antold story'kii shooting is maheene ke aakhri main shuru ho jaaegi
 a score of 74 is not bad at all
 kisi medical yaa ejineering ke chaatr se puuchhie, kahegaa ki 'distinction' se sirf ek hi ank peeche rah gaye
 For a player like Sachin, it can be said like cumin in the mouth of a camel, for which making a century in the game of cricket can be a simple and fun task like eating pauji
 hajaaron darshak maidan main or karodon apane-apane gharon main baithkar tendalya kii sambhawatah aakhri pari main teen ankon kii ummid lagaaye baithe the
 Sachin was out on double digits and India drowned in national mourning
 phir se nabbe kaa dashak yaad aa gaya, jab cricket dekhne kaa matlab sachin kii ballebaazi hi tha
 By listening to and reading his 100 centuries or 34000 runs, all of us must have become very learned in 'sachinology' by now, but it is even more important to understand how difficult it is to become and become Sachin Tendulkar
 shiksha jagat main aam kahawat he ki ek adhyaaapak ke bachche badi mushkil se 'set' hote hai, or upar se jab mataji insurance agent hon to har duusare shaks kahegaa ki badi 'tipical indian middle class family' he
 With these same middle class ideals and values, being the world's greatest batsman, as well as carrying the hopes of millions of people for 24 years, without stopping and shouting, he becomes a Sachin Tendulkar in millions
 skool main aapane 'partner in krime' rahe vinod kambli jab test kariyar kii shuruyaat main hi 2 dohare shatak jad den or log kambli ko aapse zyada guni ballebaaj kahen, to aise main 'tendalya' se 'cricket ke bhagwaan' kaa darja jo paae, vahi lakhon main ek sachin tendulkar banataa he
 Alam had been that when Sachin won the match after scoring a century, Diwali was celebrated all over the country and half of the people would stop watching TV angrily when they were out and half became critics
 bharat kii kis-kis haar main sachin kaa balla nahin chalaa, ye log jaldi yaad karte hai, lekin jo 100 shatak bane, jisaki 2 dashak pehle koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha, us itihaas ko jo rache, vahi lakhon main ek sachin tendulkar banataa he
 Whoever is accused of paying too much attention to advertisements, sometimes accusing the match-fixing of the suppressed tongue, sometimes it is said that it plays for records, sometimes there is pressure to retire, even amidst so much criticism and pressure The person is strong like a rock and persevere like a thunderbolt, he becomes a Sachin Tendulkar in lakhs
 sach ye he ki yahi wo khilaadi he jisane 80 or 90 ke dashak main janme logon ko cricket se pyaar karnaa sikhaaya, jisane ye bataaya ki mahanata ke shikhar par pahunchakar bhi namrata ko kaise barkaraar rakhaa jaae, jisane ye sikhaaya ki mehnat or lagan se ek saadhaaran parivaar kaa ek ladkaa desh kii ankhon kaa tara ban saktaa he, vahi sachin tendulkar ab khel ke maidan se dur bhale hi ja rahaa ho, lekin sachin ke liye bhi ye sach hi he "

 At the same time, Amanatullah Khan, who questioned Kumar Vishwas, has been suspended from the primary membership of the party
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke ghar hui PAC kii baithak ke baad kumaar vishwaas ne media ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki yah koi varchasv kii ladaai nahin he

 Along with this, he announced to make Vishwas in charge of the party's Rajasthan unit

 i am an activist who came from another party in AAP
 main kya kah saktaa hum
 If Kumar Vishwas is saying that there has been a conspiracy against him, then tell who is behind me
 manish sisodiya bhi amanatulla se milane pahunche
 Kumar Vishwas had these demands
 
 
 isse pehle aisi atakalein thi ki AAP netritv se naaraaz chal rahe kumaar vishwaas party kii piesi baithak main shaamil naa ho
 However, putting a stop to these speculations, they attended the meeting
 sutron ke mutabik, piesi baithak main unhone apni maange rakhin
 Earlier sources said that Vishwas will discuss the issue of corruption within the party and changes in the organization
 iske saath hi AAP kaaryakartaaon ko party ke andar mauka diya jane kaa unhone jo plan taiyaar kiya he, use lagu karne kii maang karenge
 According to sources, Kumar Vishwas has made it clear that he will not apologize for the video
 haalanki yah unhone yah bhi kaha he ki vah rashtrawaad ke mudde par virodh nahin karenge
 If sources are to be believed, they have also demanded strict action against AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan from Jamia Nagar
 kumaar vishwaas kaa imotional daanvisse pehle mangalvaar ko pehle kumaar vishwaas ne imotional hokar khule taur par party ke andar matbhed kii baat saamne rakhi

 Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has given clarification on the issue of 'e-rickshaws'
 unke daftar kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki gadakari or unke kisi rishtedaar kaa i-rickshaw banane vaali kisi company se sambandh nahin he
 Earlier, an English newspaper had reported that the 'kalyankari' scheme announced by Gadkari would benefit a company linked to Gadkari's family
 do hafte pehle, jab gadakari ne 'i-rickshaw' par lage bain ko khatm karne ke liye kanoon main badlaav, i-rickshaw par registration khatm karne or ise kharidne ke liye teen fisadi byaaj par lone dene kaa elaan kiya tha, to iskaa khub swaagat kiya gaya
 It was named the 'deen Dayal Scheme'
 lekin ab angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' kaa daawa he ki gadakari ke is faisle se dilli ke ek lakh ri-rickshaw chaalkon ke saath-saath gadakari ke parivaar se judi ek company ko bhi phayda hoga
 Remember that Gadkari is a businessman professionally
 gadakari ke bahanoi kii company ko hoga phayda?akhbaar ke mutabik, nagpur kii is company kaa naam he 'purti green technologys privet limited' (pijiti) 
 When the company was registered in 2011, its founder was Gadkari
 2011 tak vah company ke chairman bhi rahe
 Currently, its director is Gadkari's brother-in-law Rajesh Totade
 pijiti un saat companiyon main shaamil he jise council of scientific and industrial research (CSIR) kaa license mila hua he
 Right now the company is waiting for the relief of the power of the motor so that it can make a battery-powered rickshaw
 rajesh ke mutabik, centre motor vehical act main badlaav karne kii taiyaari main he or ham bhi apana product bazaar main utaarne ke liye taiyaar hai
 According to Gadkari's decision, the company was blown out of the news, Rajesh is referring to the same relief, which Gadkari mentioned in the e-rickshaw drivers' rally in the capital on June 17
 gadakari ne kaha tha, '650 wat motor kshamta vaale i-rickshon ko gaiyr motor kshamta vaali gaadi mana jayega
 Transport department and traffic police will not be able to challan them
 ' gadakari ne yah vaada bhi kiya tha ki motor vehical act 1988 main badlaav kiya jayega, kyonki abhi is act ke tahat 250 wat motor kshamta or adhiktam 25 kimi prati ghanta raftaar vaale vaahanon ko hi gaiyr motor shrenee kaa samajha jaataa he
 And when Gadkari was asked about this
 
 
 akhbaar ne is bare main email karke gadakari se poocha ki unke mantri pad par rahete hue company ko i-rickshaw banane kii manjuuri milanaa kya 'hiton ke takaraav' kaa maamla nahin he? jawaab main gadakari ne kaha he ki in i-rickshon ko kai companiyaan bana rahi hai or kisi ek company kii ekadhikaar nahin he or na hi kisi par koi roak lagaai gai he
 "as far as e-rickshaw owners are concerned with encouraging banks to take loans at the rate of 3 per cent, i have written to PM Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley," Gadkari said
 gadakari desh bhar main 2 karod i-rickshaw kii baat kar rahe hai
 The average price of a battery-powered rickshaw is between 70 thousand and one lakh rupees
 aise main pijiti jaisi companiyaan i-rickshaw ke nae bazaar main kudane ko betaab hai
 Gadkari had announced that a few days ago, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had promised that the e-rickshaw would not be banned
 unhone rikhshaavaalon ko bharosa dilaayaa tha ki unhen registration ke liye kisi daftar jane kii jarurat nahin he
 Gadkari said that the MCD will register the e-rickshaw, along with the same identity card
 i rickshaw kaa registration keval 100 rupee main hoga
 In addition, the e-rickshaw will be named Deendayal e-rickshaw
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle aam aadmi party ke netaa arvind kejariwal ne bhi i rickshaw waalon kii pairvi kii thi
 Kejriwal went to meet the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi on a rickshaw
 bain ko lekar i rikhshachalkon ne dilli main pradarshan kar centre kii nai sarkaar se apana dukhada royaa tha
 On September 12 last year, the Delhi High Court demanded a ban on e-rickshaws
 yachika main kaha gaya tha kii naa to iskaa registration hota he, naa hi koi number plate
 Nor does it have insurance cover, even it does not get fitness certificate
 bisisiai kii aamasabha kii vishesh baithak ko ‘khap panchayat’ bataane vaale apane bayaan ko waapas lete hue ipel ke nilambit ayukta lalit modi ke vakil mahmud abdi ne aaj kaha ki unke bayaan ko tod marodakar pesh kiya gaya or unka makasad board ko ‘bouna sabit karnaa’ nahin tha
 Abdi said that the media misrepresented his statement
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah unki nijee raay he or modi kaa isse koi sarokaar nahin he
 He said in a statement, "my yesterday's statement was misrepresented by a mild media person in which i used the word 'khap Panchayat'
 yah meri nijee raay thi, naa ki lalit modi kii ore se jari kiya gaya bayaan
 "abdi said," i made this comment by looking at the ways of N
 Srinivasan (board Secretary)
 ’’ When Narendra Modi submitted his claim for the next Prime Minister of India, he had no idea of the fact that a single cap would weaken his claim
 ab kaaphi charchit ho chuki 'topi kii ghatana' ahmedabad main soch-samajhkar yojit sadbhaavna upwas ke dauraan sahajata kii ek nayab misaal he, jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne 'mujhe is sammaan se alag hi rakhen' ke andaaj main moulana hazrat sufi imam shahi saiyad mehandi hossain kii ore se pesh kii gai islamic topi pahanane se inkaar kar diya
 Narendra Modi's fast is just a spectacle | The moment captured in cameras for a leader who is eager to reach out to the Muslims of India and the general public of India, that moment has a wide meaning, especially because of the variety to show the caste diversity in the country Modi seems ready to wear colorful turbans
 nitish or modi main koun banegaa pradhanmantri?bharat ke rajyon main se sarvaadhik lokapriy is prashaasak ne kisi rashtriya netaa ke liye jaruri rajnatik sweekaaryata or 2014 main pradhanmantri pad ke liye apni daavedaari kii ghoshnaa karne ke liye tindivasiy sadbhaavna upwas ke rup main gandhivadi shortkat chunaa tha
 There the line of BJP veterans, who are all as ambitious as Modi but whose height is not so big, was a sign of their growing dominance as leading contenders
 lekin jab is naatak kaa patakshep hua to kya modi mahaj aatur-adheer khilaadi ke rup main jarurat se zyada abhinay karte najar aae?intervyuu: nihit swaarth rakhane vaala hi virodh karata he: modiyah sawaal isliye anivaary ho gaya kyonki ahmedabad main khud ko sant ghoshit karne kaa naad patna main vyaapt khamoshi ke bilkul vipareet tha
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Modi have the same tune in terms of tune: both are developmental figures
 jab modi 21veen sadi ke aise sardaar patel ke rup main apane khud ke myth ko bhunaane kii koshish karte hai jo gujarat se bhi bade ilaake main chaa jane kaa adhikari he tab nitish chupchaap aatmavishvaas se apni baari kaa dhairyapurvak intjaar karte hai
 Interview: i am happy to work for Bihar: Nitishbaz Modi terrorizes his colleagues in BJP and his NDA partners on the front page of newspapers and in television prime time, then Nitish sneaks up in Patna and makes necessary statements They also refuse
 yadi ahmedabad main tadak-bhadak vibhaajan paidaa kar rahi thi, to patna main khamoshi aashwast karne vaali thi
 When the show ended and Modi took the lemon water, there came a man between him and his ambition for the Prime Minister's post - Nitish Kumar
 dakshinpanth ke nirvivaad rup se sarvaadhik lokapriy netaa modi main aakhir aisi kya baat he jisase ve 2002 ke baad gujarat main sampradayik vibhaajan kam karne kii apni prashansaneey uplabdhi ke baavjood dhruvikaran kaa centre bane hue hai? aakhir ve ab bhi gujarat se pare sweekaaryata paane ke liye sangharshrat daraavne vyakti kyon bane hue hai? india today or duusare prakashnon ke surveykshanon main bhi modi bharat ke sarvshereshth mukhyamantri or gaiyr-upie main sarvshereshth sambhavit pradhanmantri ke rup main nirantar badhat banaae hue hai, lekin ve ab bhi chhavi badalane kii pariyojna se mukti nahin paa sakteh ve nirantar prayasarat hai
 Modi is imprisoned in his own image as a leader who does not understand Hindutva
 yah hindutv-vaadiyon ke liye to thik he lekin bharat main samaveshi netritv kii sthaayee murti atal bihari vaajapeyi ne kisi dakshinpanthi pradhanmantri ke liye ek swarna maanak tay kar diya tha
 Modi is still a true fundamentalist, and fundamentalism can make someone successful but not the ultimate success
 phir dangon se jude mukademon kaa kanoonee bhavarjaal he, jisase ve nirantar ubarne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai, or unhen yaa kisi ar ko shaayad hi maaloom hoga ki ve kab tak ubar jaaenge
 Modi has prepared his answer for the critics
 unhone india today ko bataaya, ''jab maine pad sambhala to kai logon ko laga ki main sarkaar chalaane ke liye bahut anubhavheen hum lekin aaj ve hi log kehete hai ki maine khud ko khara sabit kar diya he
 So, opinions can change over time
 par bharat main bauddhik samarthy ke saath nihit swaarth vaala ek samooh he jo sardaar patel, morarji desai, atal ji, adwani ji or ab meraa virodh karata aa rahaa he
 So it is not fair to assume that i am a polarizing person ”(see talk)
 khud par is kadar yakeen puri tarah beja nahin he kyonki ve 2014 ke liye aaj bhi bhaajapa ke sabase damdaar daavedaar hai
 Modi's image will become an unstoppable force as one of the finest administrators and people with communication skills in India with a broad base
 gujarat unki jitani badi takat he, utana hi bada abhishaap bhi he
 Now they want a big gallery to hang their most popular image as the immaculate ruler and the Alambardar of development
 gujarat aisa vikaas model he jis par udyog ke diggaj naaj karte hai or da economist uske bare main likhti rahati he
 Under Modi's leadership, the state has become an economic power house whose growth rate is more than the growth rate of the country
 gujarat desh kaa 16 fisadi audyogic utpaadan karata he or desh ke niryaat main uskaa yogadan 22 fisadi he
 From infrastructure to agriculture, from education to green technology, Gujarat has shown India in a long way what the meditative leadership can do
 udyogpati or gujarat chember of commers and industry ke adhyaksh mahendra patel kehete hai, ''modi kii sabase badi thati unka mishanri jajba he, jisane naukarshahi or udyog ko kaam karne ke liye majaboor kar diya he
 His model of development is characterized by reaching the lowest levels
 '' 2007 main vidhansabha chunaav ke ain pehle bhaajapa vidhayakon ke dabaav ke baavjood sakht prashaasak modi ne bhoojal churaane main shaamil kisaanon ke khilaaf karrwai band karne se inkaar kar diya
 They have become the messengers of participatory development
 unka kahana he, ''agar aap bharat ke pichley 40 varshon ko dekhen to aap paaenge ki sattadhari partiyon ne apana vot bank majboot karne ke liye bajet banaae
 He created models that made people dependent on the government
 lekin gujarat main hamane vot bank aadhaarit model khaarij karke ek nayaa model banaaya
 As an organizer and campaigner influencing the masses, Modi now wants to woo more and more people with the slogan "sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas"
 or bhaajapa main, mukhya rathyatri adwani ke rodsho se sevanivrutt hone se inkaar ke baavjood, aisa karne main unase zyada koi sakasham nahin he
 a senior BJP leader told India Today, "after all, who else is there?" Publicly though party leaders are saying that it is too early to choose a prime ministerial candidate
 arun jetali ne 2009 ke chunaav kii taiyaari ke samay 2014 main pradhanmantri pad ke liye modi ke naam ko chalaakar yojana par pani pher diya tha
 The leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha emerging as a national leader worthy of the Prime Minister's post, says that attention is being paid to streamline the bjp's position
 ve kehete hai, ''chunaav main abhi teen saal hai
 Party president Nitin Gadkari also says that it has not been decided to present anyone as the prime ministerial candidate for 2014
 ''hamane narendrabhai ke naam par faisla nahin kiya he
 His fast was not to become Prime Minister
 yah gujarat ke bare main galatfahami dur karne ke liye tha
 "they believe that there are problems in approving Modi's name because of the 2002 riots
" ''ve is bare main khaas kuch nahin kar sakate
 "but Gadkari says that the party is trying to bring more attention to his development agenda, administrative skills and strong leadership
" ''agar modi yah sabit kar sakate hai ki vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko nirnaayak antar se parrast kar sakate hai to yah unke liye thodaa aasaan ho jayega
 "but he flatly denies the possibility of Nitish getting the benefit of it:" He may be a key partner but he is an outsider
 party kaa koi kaaryakarta unke liye prachaar nahin karegaa
 "so will the allies accept Modi?" a senior party leader says, "ultimately, votes only matter
" hamen zyada vot milenge to sahyogi dal khud-ba-khud aa jaaenge
 It is necessary for the BJP to win 165-170 seats
 or jab aap yuddh main jate hai to apane sabase badhiya jaranel ko aage rakhte hai
 Modi is the best journal in the party
 ''par is jaranel ko sabase pehle bhitari ladaai jeetni hogi
 Modi might not even like to talk to Gadkari after the RSS pracharak Sanjay Joshi was re-inducted to strengthen the BJP in Uttar Pradesh against the will of the iron man of Gujarat

 Sushma Swaraj, who arrived in Ahmedabad, was apparently uncomfortable with the person whom Swaraj believes is responsible for her political involvement after the 1999 defeat at Bellary
 party ke bhitari logon kaa maananaa he ki modi sirf swaraj kii kaat ke liye smriti irani ko rajyasabha seat dene ke liye raji hue
 Apart from Advani, Jaitley is the only central leader with whom Modi has good relations, although Jaitley has his own ambitions to become Prime Minister
 jab modi maanakar chal rahe hai ki ve mukhyamantri se bade pad ke hakdaar hai, aise main aresas gujarat main unke uttaradhikari kii soch rahaa he
 The new generation is skeptical of the Modi brand due to political ambivalence
 bhaajapa ke ek yuva netaa kaa kahana he, ''desh kaa yuva haalanki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sangharsh main eemaandaar prashasan kii maang kar rahaa he, lekin adhik samaveshi saamaajik dhaancha bhi chaah rahaa he
 In today's era, Modi cannot wash the stains of 2002
 vah bana rahegaa
 The party will have to think beyond Modi
 ''isiilie modi kii aturata main nitish kii aashaa chhipi he
 If Nitish is made a prime ministerial candidate, parties like TDP, Biju Janata Dal and AGP - traditionally anti-congress but afraid of losing the support of minorities by staying with the BJP - would like to come to the NDA
 musalamaanon ke vot hasil karne ke maamle main apane record ke alaava nitish modi kii hi tarah vikaas kii raajnneeti main bhi jeet rahe hai
 As administrator, he has made improvements in important areas ranging from restoring law and order to health, education services and road construction
 netaa ke rup main unhone lakshith saamaajik kalyaan yojanaayen aage badhaai hai
 According to his supporters, if Nitish can make Bihar an effective state, then he also has the ability to change India in the name of NDA
 par nitish kii sabase badi kami unka chunavi aadhaar he
 He may have the credibility and distinction of becoming a national leader, but JD-U with only 20 members in the 543-member Lok Sabha has no political power outside Bihar
 haalanki naveen patnayak jaise netaaon ke saath unke achche rajnatik sambandh hai, lekin koi kshetreey kshatrap unke netritv kaa samarthan karne ke liye abhi tak aage nahin aayaa he
 The biggest obstacle for him will be Modi himself
 unki umr main maatr chah maheene kaa antar hone se-modi bade hai or ve pichley saptaah hi 61 saal ke hue hai-donon ek-duusare ko nishprabhavi kar sakate hai
 There is no attachment between the two
 10 may, 2009 ko unke sambandh us samay adhik bighad gaye jab ludhiana kii ek jansabha main modi ne ekajutata dikhaane ke liye nitish kaa haath pakadakar jabaran uthaa diya
 Many considered it Modi's success because before that Nitish had blamed Modi's plan to campaign in the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar
 naam na chhapane kii shart par jad-you ke varisht netaa kehete hai ki agar modi ko bhaajapa kii ore se pradhamantri pad kaa daavedaar ghoshit kiya gaya to nitish gathbandhan se baahar hone ke liye maansik rup se taiyaar hai
 Nitish feels that he can take the risk with 117 JD-U mlas - and some independents - in the 243-member Bihar assembly
 bihar main bhaajapa unki sahyogi dal he
 Nitish has managed to keep Modi beyond Bihar till now
 november, 2005 main bihar ke mukhyamantri kii kursi sanbhaalane ke baad se hi nitish ne rajya main modi ke prachaar par roak laga di he
 Nitish does not even mention Modi's name on the open platform, and considers the Chief Minister of Gujarat as a communal leader who is not acceptable in his brand of inclusive politics
 june, 2010 main modi ke samarthakon ne bihar ke akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar ludhiana kii raily main gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke saath unki tasviir prakashit karwaai thi jisase nitish bahut naaraaz hue the
 The advertisements singled out Bihar's flood assistance to Bihar
 nitish ne tab patna main bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini baithak ke liye jute party ke varisht netaaon ko ratribhoj kaa nimantran waapas lene main gurej nahin kiya tha
 He not only refused to attend the bjp's public meeting at the end of the meeting but also gave Rs 5 crore towards the support of the Gujarat government

 Nitish rocked the alliance with the BJP
 unhen maaloom he ki bhaajapa unke jaise vyakti ko ganvaa nahin sakati
 The Congress is trying to woo them

 In a conversation with India Today, he adopted a diplomatic approach, saying, "the BJP has not yet declared a prime ministerial candidate
" tabhi ham apni raay jataa sakate hai'' (dekhen baatcheet)

 Ajay and Abhay are sons of former Chief Minister Omprakash Chautala
 ajay or unke pita inelo ke kaarykaal main hue shikshak bhartee ghotaale main sajaa kaat rahe hai
 Some people consider Dushyant to be a risky person
 unhone inelo ke uttaradhikaar ko lekar apane chachaa abhaya ke saath kanoonee ladaai main padane kii jagah nayi party banane kaa vikalp chunaa tha
 Some Khapas and former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal had tried to reconcile the Chautala family, but Dushyant remained firm on his decision

 Its candidate Digvijay Chautala lost to the BJP, but the JJP managed to push Congress' strongman Randeep Singh Surjewala to third place
 iske baad jajpa ne loksabhaa chunaav main teen seat aam aadmi party ke liye chhodte hue saat siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 At that time, the BJP won all 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state and cleared the sweep of other parties
 dushyant chautaala ko khud apni hisar seat ganvaani padi thi
 But this defeat did not prevent him from going towards the larger goal of party building and emerging as a force in the assembly elections
 jajpa ne is baar kisi ke saath gathbandhan nahin kiya or vidhansabha chunaav apane dam par hi ladaa
 The Ushyant Chautala himself chose the option to fight against tight margins Uchana East Kalan seat minister Birendra Singh's wife and BJP leader Prem Lata and won
 premalata ne pichhali baar unhen is seat par haraaya tha
 Recalling his journey in the last five years, Dushyant said, 'there has been a lot of change, i had to give up my studies to get into politics and today i am leading the party
 iske liye kade prayaas or bade badlaavon kii jarurat he
 Dushyant Chautala was very active in Parliament as an MP

 Recently, French Foreign Minister Lauren Fabius, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar in Delhi, said, "more than 170 countries have already shown their commitment before the conference, which represents a total of 91 percent of global emissions
 We do
 yah aashajanak he
 "he says," We want each side to engage in the last round of negotiations on a practical level and i think India will do the same and encourage other countries as well

 "many heads of state, including Modi, will be present at the beginning of the conference, so it is expected that the negotiators will be bound to reach some decision and will come to some agreement

 If you compare it with the European Union, which has committed to a 40 per cent reduction in emissions from 1990 levels, then the writing on the wall will be clearly visible
 is saal ke aarambh main europea sangh or china ne nimna carbon aadhaarit vruddhi ko lakshya banane or carbon bazaar se judi takanic or gyaan ko saajha karne par sanyukt rup se sahmati jaahir kii thi
 At the G7 conference, Canada and Japan also agreed to phase out the use of fossil fuels by the end of this century
 bharat ke paas navikarniya urja ko lekar jo yojana maujuud he, vah duniya kii sabase mahatvakankshi yojanaon main se ek he

 Currently, more than 170 countries, which the INDC has entrusted to the United Nations, are below this target, according to which, by 2025, 53 to 58 gigatons and by 2030 54 to 59 gigatons of carbon dioxide levels are to be stopped
 
 isse yah pataa chalata he ki vaastavik utsarjanon or utsarjan kii manshaa ke bich baari fark maujuud he or yadi paris main koi sandhi ho bhi jaati he, tab bhi yah mudda chintajanak bana rahegaa

 Javadekar hopes that the Paris conference will be the architect of the new climate system
 chunki bharat ne navikarniya urja ke maamle main ab tak kaa sabase mahatvakankshi lakshya tay kiya he or vaartakar sahamat hai ki hamane apni kshamta se kahin zyada kaam kar diya he isliye hamen paris main darkinar nahin kiya jayega

 "the issue of finance may take a new dimension in Paris, as Rajamani says," Green climate is currently in the experimental phase
 hamen yah jaananaa hoga ki paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he or use kaise vitarit kiya jayega
 In addition, there has to be a balance of responsibilities in terms of actual results
 ''bose kehete hai, ''sandhi kii kanoonee sthiti par baat kerani hogi or antim taur par sab kuch is par nirbhar karegaa ki iandisi kya paksh lete hai
 Many of them are conditional and while the developed countries are seeking a review of the cut targets, our case is related to finance and technology, so there is no question of supporting such a review

 The budget session of the newly appointed assembly of Punjab starts on Wednesday
 14 june se lekar ye satr 23 june tak chalegaa
 In this session, the Captain Government of Punjab will present its first general budget on 20 June
 lekin satr shuru hone se pehle hi vipakshi partiyon aam aadmi party or akali-bijepi gathbandhan ne tay kar liya he ki kisaanon ke karj maafee, kisaanon kii aatmahatya, daliton par ho rahe hamale jaise kai mudde hai jinhen lekar punjab kii congress sarkaar ko gheraa jayega
 On behalf of the akali-bjp alliance, Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal and Punjab BJP chief Vijay Sampla on Tuesday met Punjab Governor VP Badnaur on all these issues and demanded the dismissal of the Captain government by giving a memorandum
 sukhbir badal ne saaf kar diya ki aane vaala vidhansabha satr captain sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin hone vaala or akali dal congress sarkaar ko is satr ke dauraan aade haath lene main koi kasar nahin chhodega
 Captain government will be surrounded on the farmers issue, the biggest issue in the assembly session will be the loan waiver of the farmers
 punjab ke kisaanon kii dailygation ne mangalvaar ko punjab ke governor ve pi badnaur se mulaakaat kii or memorondom dekar unhen bataaya ki kis tarah se congress ne satta main aane se pehle kisaanon ke karj maafee ke vaade kiye the lekin ab satta main aane ke baad congress apane vaadon ko bhul rahi he
 The farmers of Punjab made it clear that if the Punjab government did not make any major announcement regarding the loan waiver of farmers in the coming days and during the budget session to be held on June 20, then the movement will be started in the whole Punjab
 saath hi punjab ke kisaan 15 june ko dilli ke jantar mantar par hone vaale kisaanon ke satyagrah main bhi shaamil honge
 Though the Punjab government has tried to give confidence to the farmers that all possible help will be tried for the farmers in the coming budget, but the problem is with the farmers that one more government has promised to give relief to the farmers and waiver of debt
 Doing it and secondly, its economic status is also being given by the government, in such a situation, farmers are now less hopeful that they will get any major relief from the Punjab government She is supposed to kul milakar buudhvaar se shuru hone vaale punjab vidhansabha ke satr main punjab kii congress sarkaar kii mushkilen behad hi badhane vaali hai
 While on the one hand they will have to face the attacks of opposition parties Aam Aadmi Party and akali-bjp alliance inside the House, they will also have to face the anger of the farmers on the road
 gil kii shradhanjali par bhi siyasatpanjab vidhansabha ke buudhvaar ko shuru hone vaale satr main punjab ke purv dijipi divangat capies gil ko lekar siyasat shuru ho gai he
 The Akali Dal has written a letter to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh demanding not to pay tribute to KPS Gill in the tributes paid before the commencement of proceedings on Wednesday inside the assembly
 akali dal kii kor cameti kii meeting main ye faisla liya gaya ki buudhvaar se shuru hone vaale punjab vidhansabha satr ke dauraan divangat IPS capies gil ko shradhanjali naa di jaae
 a letter from the Akali Dal was also written to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh demanding that KPS Gill should not be allowed to pay tribute inside the House
 akali dal kaa maananaa he ki capies gil ne aatankwaad ke daur main kai begunaah sikhon kaa jhootha encounter kiya or unhen aatanki bataa kar maar diya
 For this reason, the Akali Dal does not want KPS Gill to be paid tribute within the Punjab Assembly
 punjab vidhansabhaamein divangat IPS capies gil ko shradhanjali naa dene kii akali dal kii darkhwaast ko punjab sarkaar ne nakaar diya he
 Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal said that KPS Gill has done a lot of work against terrorism in Punjab and because of that, peace prevails in Punjab today and the Congress government does not agree with the Akali Dal and before the assembly session starts Tributes will also be paid to KPS Gill among the tributes paid
 punjab vidhansabha ke satr ke pehle hi hangaamedaar rahane ke asaar hai or abkepies gilko shradhanjali diye jane ke maamle par bhi ek or vivaad khadaa ho gaya he jis par punjab vidhansabha main baari hangaamaa hone ke asaar hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has written a short prologue in 'beyond the Dreamgirl', a biography of actress and BJP MP Hema Malini
 stardst ke purv sampadak or nirmaataa ram camel mukherjee kii yah kitaab 16 oktober ko hema malini ke 69wein janmdin par launch hogi
 This day will also mark 50 years of Hema Malini in Indian cinema
 nirmaataa ram camel mukherjee ne bataaya ki hema malini ke liye apni bhaawanaaon ke bare main hamaare pradhanmantri ne pustak main bahut sankshep main likhaa he
 It is a matter of great pride for me as a writer and also for Hema ji and perhaps for the first time a post-prime Minister has written a prologue for a book based on a Bollywood artist
 bataa den ki hema malini ne saal 1999 main gurdaspur, punjab main bijepi ummidavaar ke liye loksabhaa chunaavon main prachaar kiya tha
 She is currently a BJP MP from Mathura constituency
 mukherjee ne kaha ki main samajhataa hum ki hema ji kii saakh or kala or cinema main yogadan ke kaaran hi modi ji prastaavna likhane ke liye raji hue
 When i was talking to his office, he was quite happy to know that Hema ji has not limited his talk in the book to Bollywood only
 nijee jindagi se lekar rajnatik jivan kaa bhi hoga zikrahema malini par likhi gai yah kitaab 23 adhyyon main banty hui he
 This included his childhood, adolescence, Bollywood, his rise as an actress, love, co-stars, ballet dance, launching Shah Rukh Khan in the film 'dil Aashna Hai' as a director, his political life and spiritual journey has gone
 kitaab main unki donon betiyon aisha or ahaana ke bare main bhi do adhyay hai
 Mukherjee said that he has also talked about the accident in Agra and his career as a singer
 hamane in sabko 'bliss' naamak adhyay main likhaa he
 This book also tells about Hema ji's family, about whom nothing has ever been published before
 is kitaab main hema malini ke vyaktigat, peshewar or raajnneetik jivan se judi kai tasviren hongi
 In this way, when asked PM Modiyah, who agreed to write the prologue, how did you persuade Modi to write the prologue, Mukherjee said that when i started writing this book two years ago, i did not think about it
 main prastaavna likhane ke liye kisi or kii talash kar rahaa tha
 When i spoke to Hema about Modi ji, he said that your mind has gone bad? When i told her that there was nothing wrong in trying, she agreed
 unhone aage kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki modi ji ko unka (hema) shastreey nrity or sangeet ke prati rujhaan or jis tarah se vah iskaa prachaar antarrashtriya manch par karti hai vah pasand he
 i believe that apart from being Hema Malini, these qualities are her (hema Malini) trait and as far as i feel it is also justified for the title of the book

 Let me tell you that Katrina Kaif is considered to be the reason for Ranbir and Deepika's breakup

 In parties too, they often ignore each other

 But Disha was not seen in any scene with Katrina Kaif in the multistarrer movie
 disha or katrina kaa film main koi seen saath main nahin tha
 Disha is also disappointed with this
 ek intervyuu main disha paatani ne bataaya ki wo ise durbhagyapurna maanati hai ki bharat main unhen katrina caff ke saath kaam karne kaa koi mauka nahin mila
 At the same time, the actress is highly excited by sharing the screen with Salman Khan

 In India, Disha played the role of Salman Khan's girlfriend

 If Rahul Gandhi believes, to make India strong, the Congress party will have to come up with a new model, in which the future will have to be linked to the past
