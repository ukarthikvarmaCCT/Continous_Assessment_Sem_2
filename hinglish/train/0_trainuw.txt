 Sachin Tendulkar is the highest run-scorer in Test cricket! Sachin Tendulkar is the highest run-scorer in ODI cricket! Sachin Tendulkar, the batsman to score the most centuries in Test cricket! Sachin Tendulkar, the batsman who scored the most century in ODI cricket! The batsman Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar who scored a century! There are no such records which are recorded in the name of Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar
 bharat bhaagyashaalee he jo aisa cricketer yahaan paidaa hua, jisane desh ke tirange ko hameshaa shaan se ooncha rakhaa
 
 
 
 
 
 lekin kya kabhi aapane sochaa he ki agar sachin tendulkar ko itani baar galat out naa diya jaataa to unke records, unke aankade kahaan hote! ye mahaan ballebaaj jitna khushkismat rahaa he, shaayad utana badakismat bhi! sachin ne 463 vanade match main 18426 ran banaae, jabaki 200 test maichon main 15921 ran
 These records belong to the batsman who has been the victim of wrong decision almost once in every series
 jaraa sochie agar ye julm sachin par naa hua hota to is ballebaaz ke aankade kya hote!ajeeb baat to ye he ki aaj cricket main itnaa zyada technology ke istemaal ke baad bhi ampire sachin ke khilaaf galatiyon pe galtiyaan karte rahe
 From 1999 till now, Sachin had to suffer the wrong decision about 40 times, what else can it be called, if not misfortune! West Indies' Steve Buckner, Sri Lanka's Ashoka d'silva and Australia's Darrell Harper are some of the umpires who broke the hearts of crores of cricket lovers of India by giving Sachin out several times
 yaad kije 1999 kaa edilade test jahaan sachin tendulkar ko derel harper ne kandhe par gend lagane ke baavjood bhi elbeadblu out de diya tha
 Remember the 1998 final against Australia in Sharjah when Michael Kasprowicch was lbw out for a ball that went far beyond the off stump
 yahaan tak ki simon toffel or aleem daar jaise vishwasaneey ampire bhi sachin ko galat out dene main peeche nahin rahe, 28 janvari 2000 ko perth main pakistan ke khilaaf toffel ne sachin ko jersey par gend lagane ke baavjood bhi cott bihaind out de diya, or match bharat haar gaya
 In the 2007 series against England, Aleem Dar gave Sachin a wrong catch, although later Aleem Dar himself confessed that he had made a mistake
 2007 ke england siries main hi sachin jab 99 par the, us vakt bhi unhen ampire ian guld ne galat cott bihaind nirnay kaa shikaar hona padaa tha
 Do not know how many such occasions came when Sachin had to suffer the wrong decision, but if it is not the greatness of Sachin, what else can he say that he did not question the umpire's decision even once
 ran to kitnon ne banaae honge, match bhi kitnon ne jitaaye honge, lekin shaayad sachin ne jo kiya wo koi kabhi naa kar paae! or shaayad yahi vajah he ki aaj sara cricket jagat is sachche champion ke ritairement kii khabar se dukhi he!

 bihar main siyaasi ghamaasan or dilli ke dangal menegsit pole kii niraashaake bich bijepi 'aage dekho' kii ranneeti par chalane vaali he
 It is said that party president Amit Shah has clearly told his leaders that they should now leave the electoral results of Delhi and focus on Bihar
 angreji akhbaar 'iconomic times' kii khabar ke mutabik, party alaakaman beete ek saal main bihar main kii gai mehnat ko lekar kaaphi gambhir he
 He is working very hard on the caste-wise equation, especially in the backward class voters in the state
 iske saath hi bijepi ke khilaaf khadey ho rahe janata dal parivaar ko lekar bhi shah apni ranneeti banane main jute hai
 a senior BJP leader admitted that the impact of the election results in Delhi will also be seen in Bihar
 agar dilli main AAP kii jeet hoti he to bihar main bijepi virdohi dhada majboot hoga
 The party leader said, "certainly the defeat in Delhi will have an impact in Bihar
 virodhiyon kaa manobal badhegaa ki modi-shah ke rath ko roka ja saktaa he
 Shah's appeal amid exit polls: The party leader said that amid the negative results of exit polls, the party president appealed to the activists to focus on Bihar
 bijepi netaa ne kaha, 'adhyakshaji ne kaha ki ham nateezon ke baad dilli main chunaav kii samiksha karenge
 But there is no such situation as upset, disappointed or giving up on the results of the exit poll
 'gauratlab he ki ravivaar ko party ne is babat ek samiksha baithak bhi bulaai thi
 Whereas, the current political situation of Bihar and the strategy towards this meeting was also discussed
 khaas baat yah he ki yah sab aise samay hua jab amit shah dilli main maujuud nahin hai
 That is, even sitting in far away Ahmedabad, Shah is working fiercely on the party's 'look ahead' strategy
 madhya pradesh sarkaar madhya pradesh govansh vadh pratishedh adhinium, 2004 main ek sanshodhan lekar aa rahi he, jisamen vyaktiyon yaa sampattiyon par kathith gorakshakon ke hamale ko gambhir aparaadh kii shrenee main laayaa jayega
 After this, Madhya Pradesh will become the first state in the country to bring such a law
 is makasad se laae ja rahe prastaavit sanshodhan ko adhinium main dhara 6si ke taur par shaamil kiya jayega
 Anyone violating this can be sentenced to a minimum of six months and a maximum of three years imprisonment
 lekin agar yah ulanghan kisi gaiyrkanoonee rup se ekatra bheed ne kiya he to maamle main namjad har vyakti ko kam se kam ek saal or adhiktam paanch saal ke karawas or 50 hajaar rupye ke jurmaane kii sajaa ho sakati he
 It also has the provision of punishing the perpetrator of the crime at par with the perpetrator
 sanshodhan main goraksha ke naam par kisi vyakti athwa uski sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchane kii koshish ke liye bhi dand kaa praavdhaan rakhaa gaya he
 The punishment will be halved
 vahiin, duusari baar yaa baar-baar is tarah kaa aparaadh karne waalon ko pehali baar ke mukaable doguna dand bhugatna padegaa
 The bill was approved by the Madhya Pradesh cabinet on 26 June and will now be introduced in the Monsoon session of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly starting on 8 July
 rajya congress kii pravaktaa shobhaa ojha kaa kahana tha ki ''badi sankhya main aise maamle saamne aa rahe the jisamen kisi khaas party se jude gunde goraksha ke naam par kanoon apane haath main le rahe the
 An amendment in the law will help in dealing with such elements
 '' unka daawa tha ki pichley paanch saal main desh bhar main go raksha ke naam par 150 logon ko peet-petakar maar die jane ke maamle saamne aae hai
 The Supreme Court had also asked states in September 2017 to stop violence in the name of cow protection
 rochak baat yah he ki goraksha ke naam par hatyaon ke maamle uttar pradesh, jharkhand or rajasthan se to saamne aate rahe hai lekin madhya pradesh main iske zyada maamle nahin hue hai
 The last major case took place in Satna in May 2018 when a man named Riyaz Khan was beaten to death by a mob on suspicion of carrying beef
 aise main madhya pradesh sarkaar kyon kanoon main sanshodhan karne par majaboor hui?congress ke sutron kaa kahana he ki is saal farvari main madhya pradesh sarkaar kii us samay khaasi kirakiri hui jab khandwa or malwa jilon main kathith go-taskaron ke khilaaf rasuka laga di gai thi
 The state government had said at the time that if the police did not take action, there was a danger of increasing communal tension
 lekin tabhi sarkaar par is baat kaa bhi dabaav bad gaya tha ki vah gorakshakon ke khilaaf bhi sakhti barte
 The last major case in Chhattisgarh came in May 2018 when Riyaz Khan was beaten to death by a mob on suspicion of carrying beef in Satna 5 years jail and a fine of Rs 50,000 has been fixed in the hands of the mob in the name of cow protection In the crime of violence
 kam se kam sajaa ek saal kii jail
 Sentenced to 3 years in prison and fine of Rs 25,000 in case of a person
 isamen kam se kam 6 maah kii jail kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he As the Lok Sabha election enthusiasts are intensifying, political parties have intensified attacks on each other
 isi kadi main congress ne bijepi par kadaa prahaar kiya he
 Maharashtra Congress has launched a book on 100 mistakes of Modi government
 iskaa naam rakhaa gaya he '100 mystex of modi'
 Things are explained through the cartoon character
 congress kaa kahana he ki shishupal kii maa ne krishna se kaha tha ki shishupal kii 100 galtiyaan maaf kar den
 This book was launched by Mallikarjun Kharge, a prominent Congress leader
 is dauraan unke saath congress ke bade netaa ashok chavaan, kasee venugopal samate kai anya log maujuud rahe

 congress party ne maharashtra main is kitaab ko launch kiya he
 The way the Prime Minister is targeting the Congress and Congress President Rahul Gandhi in every rally and is continuously attacking the Gandhi family
 is kitaab ko uskaa jawaab mana ja rahaa he

 The 122-page decision of the Supreme Court to repeal Section 66A of the Information Technology Act 2000 is very strong and rational
 apane chote-se astitv kaal main is kanoon kaa istemaal soshal media par aisi tippaniyon ke aadhaar par logon ko jail main daalane ke liye kiya gaya jo kisi bhi lihaaj se nuksandaayak nahin thim
 An attempt was also made to curb the use of online media through this law
 justise rohinton epa
 Nariman started by clarifying the three basic aspects of freedom of speech and expression - discussion, advocacy and incitement
 unhone saaf kiya ki kisi bhi khaas makasad, chaahe vah kitna bhi nindaneey kyon na ho, par mahaj charchaa karnaa yaa uski vakaalat karnaa hameshaa abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke tahat surakshit rahegaa
 Restrictions will be required only when discussion or advocacy reach the stage of provoking someone
 bharat main abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke daayre ko itane spasht rup se vyakt kiye jate maine kabhi nahin dekha
 Now this principle can be immediately applied in a variety of contexts - from parody and comedy to political opposition to the freedom to flourish without fear of harassment
 is siddhant kaa istemaal karke justise nariman ne un sabhi daleelon ko khaarij kar diya jo samvidhan ke anuchhed 19(2) ke tahat abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke apwaadon ke bahaane section 66e ko bachaane ke liye di jaati rahi thim
 The Supreme Court also refused to believe that Section 66A was designed in the interest of 'public order', on the grounds that it kept both the messages being sent to individuals and to the public
 is
 court ne avmaananaa ke apwaad ke tahat bhi is dhara ko bachaae rakhane se manaa kar diya kyonki uskaa aashay kisi kii pratishtha ko chot pahunchane se nahin he
 Nor did the court allow this section to be protected under the prescribed exception to prevent it from 'inciting any wrongdoing' because it had the intention of prohibiting all information, regardless of whether it provoked anyone or not
 
 ant main, court ne is dhara ko abhadra yaa aniatikta ke apwaad ke tahat bachaae rakhane kii har koshish ko bhi khaarij kar diya kyonki is dhara main in sari avadharanaon kaa behad sarsari taur par hi zikr kiya gaya he
 The government's stand in this matter was highly protective and narrow
 sarkaar ne court ko kisi kanoon ko is arth main spasht karne kaa daayitv yaad dilaane kii koshish kii jisase uski parinti ko barkaraar rakhaa ja sake
 His Additional Solicitor General (ASG) even tried to teach up to a list of such provisions which according to him should be read along with the provisions of Section 66A to make this section more 'practical'
 jawaab main nariman ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki eesg praavdhaan kaa koi vikalp chaahate hai‚Äîjisaki ijaajat dene se unhone inkaar kar diya
 The government then argued that this fact does not form the basis for rejecting the clause that it can be misused and that the government is committed to freedom of expression and will only use it to prevent excesses on others
 is par nariman ne jawaab diya, "sarkarein aati-jaati rahati hai lekin dhara-66e bani hi rahati
 "therefore this section should be evaluated on the basis of its merits, not on the basis of how it will be implemented

 By stamping some such proposals, the NDA government can fulfill two promises of its manifesto

 The defense procurement came to a standstill after the UPA government exposed the suspected role of several key officials in the purchase of 12 Augustwestland VVIP helicopters in 2010
 modi sarkaar ke afasarshahi ko adhikarasampann banane ke nirdesh se kharid kaa maamla aage badaae kii ummid he

" ''jod-tod kii kam gunjaaishasunne main bhale behad aakarshak lag rahaa ho, lekin raksha saude baari keemat vasuulenge
 This will make India the largest buyer of military equipment in the world, a dubious title which has been achieved since 2010
 sainya sajo-saamaan kii kharid ke liye 57,796 karod rupye main se kareeb aadhi rakam aayaat par kharch honi he
 Its imports are 14 per cent higher than the world's arms deals and nearly three times that of its close rivals Pakistan and China
 sabhi 10 lambit saudon par muhar lagane kaa matlab he ki sarkaar ko videshi companiyon ko kam-se-kam 15 fisadi yaa 10,000 karod rupye zyada dene honge
 The prices have also gone up due to the delay
 masalan, raksha mantralay ne 2005 main 126 ladaaku vimaanon ko kharidne kaa jo man banaaya tha, uski keemat 2007 main 42,000 karod rupye aanki gai thi
 But in 2014, this price can go up to Rs 1,00,000 crore
 yani har rafel vimaan kii keemat 590 karod rupye tak baith sakati he
 This means that the government will have to arrange additional funds for these deals as the defense budget has been increasing by only 5% every year
 dilli main institute of dephence studies and analysis ke lakshmana kumaar behara kehete hai, ''mudrasphiti kii dar 8 fisadi he
 This means that the defense budget has actually decreased
 ''isliye jetali kii chunauti 2,30,000 karod rupye ke bajet main santulan banane kii hogi kyonki paramparaagat rup se palada nae sazosaman kii kharid ke badale sainikon par kharch kii ore jhukaa rahata he
 India spends 66 per cent of its defense budget on salaries, while only 33 per cent is spent on the purchase of equipment
 sajo-saamaan kii kharid ke bajet kii bhi kareeb 90 fisadi rakam pehle se hue saudon kii salanaa kist chukaane main kharch ho jaataa he
 In this way only a very small amount is left for the purchase of arms or other goods
 isliye jetali ko raksha bajet kaaphi badhanaa padegaa
 They will also have to resolve another issue related to this
 masalan, raksha mantralay ladaaku kshamta badhaane ke liye dhaanche ke punarsangyojan ke prastaavon ko andekha karata rahaa he
 All three parts of the army have been projecting their needs separately for new equipment
 isse sajo-saamaan kii kharid kaa maamla lambit hota rahaa he or mantralay manjuuri dene main susti dikhaata rahaa he
 The minister will also have to arrange funds for the formation of a new mountain strike corps of 90,000 army soldiers

 Building Indigenous Capacity This year, the Navy may finalize a deal with South Korea's Kangnam Shipyard for eight state-of-the-art vessels capable of identifying and destroying landmines at sea
 yah 8,800 karod rupye kaa sauda kisi purvi asian desh se sabase bada sauda hoga
 South Korea's industry lagged behind India in the 1970s, but thanks to the visionary defense policy of promoting the private sector, today it has become an exporter of arms and is also ready to sell jets and howitzers to India before the Kanganam deal
 
 raksha mantralay ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''bharat jis desh se fouran sikh saktaa he, vah he dakshin korea

 48,000 crore, which may hit the growth of indigenous capacity

" kam-se-kam do bhartiya companiyon tata power or bharat forj ne videshi top companiyon ko kharida or ab thal sena ko swadeshi top kharidne kii peshkash kar rahi hai
 Clearly, such a new solution should be part of the traditional budget speech of the country's finance minister: "there will be no problem in meeting additional needs for the security of the country

 unhone kaha ki jin janpratinidhiyon par loktantr ko majboot banane kii jimmedaari he, agar wo hi gunahagaar honge, to desh ke loktantr ke liye khatra paidaa hone kii sambhaavna he
 Anna Hazare says that after being convicted in a criminal case, it is extremely important to completely ban the leaders from contesting elections
 aise netaaon ko kanoon ke tahat sajaa bhi milani chahie
 Stringent laws should be made for this, so that incidents of politicians indulging in crime can be stopped

 Anna Hazare said that if the central government is dreaming of building a corruption-free India, then for this, there is a need to impose lifetime ban on the election of convicted mlas and mps
 unhone kaha ki rajyon or centre ko netaaon ke khilaaf maamalon kii sunwaayee ke liye vishesh nyaayalay gathit karne main koi harj nahin hona chahie
 If this happens, positive results will be seen within a year

 input language prayagraj main parsi kabrgah ke bich bani firoz jahangir gandhi kii kabrgah aaj bhi apni pushton kaa intjaar kar rahi he
 Babulal, who protects the tomb of Congress President Rahul Gandhi's grandfather, says that Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi should visit the graves of their forefathers
 firoz firoz gandhi kii majaar ko lekar vivaad tak khadaa hua jab uttar pradesh ke upmukhyamantri dinesh sharma ne gujarat main ek bayaan main kaha tha ki rahul gandhi ke dada ji firoz jahangir gandhi kii kabr prayagraj main he jahaan wo ab tak nahin aae hai
 He should visit his grandfather's grave and also make a candle so that his soul may rest in peace
 saath hirahul gandhi ke gotraka zikr karte hue dinesh sharma ne kaha tha, 'unka dattatreya gotra he or isliye main unhen aamantran de rahaa hum ki wo vahaan par aaen
 Godan is done here, so that the soul of the ancestors may be at peace
 'prayagrajamen parsi majaar kii dekh-rekh karne vaale babulal ne dinesh sharma ke bayaan kaa khandan karte hue kaha ki rahul gandhi is majaar par aae the or 10 saal pehle unhone phool-maala bhi arpit kii
 The other people who looked after this tomb with Babulal also said that Sonia Gandhi has also come here
 haalanki babulal samet in tamaam logon kaa kahana he ki is ghatana ko 10 saal ho chuke hai, firoz gandhi unke dada hai isliye rahul gandhi ko yahaan lagaataar aana chahie
 Babulal said that Kirahul Gandhi often comes to Allahabad, so he should also visit his grandfather's tomb

 i used to get nervous meeting new men in the same way, but here was that 'new man' Manto, with whom i was going to meet for the first time
 meri ghabrahat vahshat kii hadon ko chune lagi
 i told Shahid, "come on, let's go back, Manto might not be at home," but Shahid dashed my hopes
 ''vah shaam ko ghar hi par rahata he kyonki vah shaam ko roj peetaa he
 "take this, a hundred Durre on the dead!" One is Manto, and he is also drinking Manto, but i got hard
 aisa bhi kya? mujhe kha to nahin jayega! hone do, jo uski jabaan kii nok par dank he, main bulbula to hum nahin jo phoonk maari, to baith jaaoongi
 We reached the destination by fixing the ravine-laden stairs
 ''aaie, aaie!'' bade khile maathe se manto khadaa ho gaya
 Manto always used to sit on the pedestal and looked very small, but when standing, his height would be dragged out, and it would look very poisonous when he crawled and stood several times
 uske jism par khaddar kaa kurta-pajama or jawahar-cat sadri thi
 "hey, i used to think, you will be very black, dry, dry, kind of cool," he said laughing out his teeth
 ''or main samajhati thi, aap nihaayat dabang kism ke galheer chinghadte hue punjabi honge
 '' i thought
 raseed dete chalo, kahin yah ekadam na lapte par le le
 And other moments, both of us started wholeheartedly arguing that as long as we were not aware of each other, we had incurred huge losses, and had to meet them
 do-teen baar baat ulajh gai, lekin jaraa-sa takalluf baaki tha
 So, kept on meeting for another meeting
 kai ghante hamaare jabade mashiinon kii tarah vibhinn vishyon par jumale katarte rahe or maine jald hi maaloom kiya ki meri tarah manto bhi baat kaatane kaa aadi he
 Before he heard the whole thing, he uttered a speech, and the trouble that was there, also disappeared

 In the midst of the heat, i once looked closely at the shore
 mote-mote shishon ke peeche lapakati hui badi-badi siyaah putliyon vaali ankhen, jinhen dekhakar mujhe basaakhta mor ke pankh yaad aa gaye
 What is the combination of peacock feathers and eyes? i could never know this, but whenever i looked into his eyes i remembered peacock feathers
 shaayad ahankaar or gustaakhee ke saath-saath unamem basaakhta prafullata mujhe moron ke pankhons kii yaad dilaati thi
 i was shocked to see those eyes
 unhen to maine kahin dekha he
 Looked very closely
 kahkahe lagaate, sanjidagi se muskuraate vyangy ke nashtar barasaate or phir nazle kii avasthaa main patharaate! pite-pite achaanak manto khansane laga
 My forehead was shocked yah khaansee to jaani-pahachaani si thi
 i had heard it since childhood
 mujhe koft hone lagi
 Don't know what i said, "this is absolutely wrong," and we fought back
 ''aap kuj-bahsi kar rahi hai! xxrep 4 ' himakat he yah! xxrep 4 ' dhaandhlee he, ismat bahan! xxrep 4 ' aap mujhe bahan kyon kah rahe hai?'' maine chidhkar kaha
 "just like that

 i don't even call my sister a sister
 xxrep 4 ' to phir mujhe chidhaane ko kah rahe hai? xxrep 4 ' nahin, to, vah kaise janaa aapane? xxrep 4 ' isliye ki mere bhai hameshaa jalaate, chidhaate or maarthe-peetate rahe yaa pakadakar pitwate rahe
 "manto laughed out loud," then i will definitely call you sister
 xxrep 4 ' to itnaa yaad rakhie ki mere bare main mere bhaaiyon ke khayalaat bhi kuch khushgavaar nahin hai

 shahid jo hamaari jhadpen alag-thalag baithe dekh rahe the, bhukh se tang aa chuke the
 On reaching Malad it will be one o'clock, so the food should be eaten
 manto ne mujhase almaari se platen or chamache nikaalane ko kaha or khud hotel se roti lene chalaa gaya
 "take out the pickle from that barn
" '' manto ne teji se mej par khaanaa lagaaya or kursi par ukaduun baith gaya
 We started eating without first saying to anyone, like we have been used to eating like this for years
 khaane ke bich main garmagarm bahes bhi chalati rahi
 Manto used to turn around and tear my story out of the loaf, which was my pain in those days
 maine bahut taalna chaha, magar vah dhithaayee se ada rahaa, or uskaa ek-ek taar ghaseet daalaa
 He was shocked, hearing that i regret writing 'lihaaf'
 khub jali-kati suna daali or mujhe bahut bujdil or kam-najar kah daalaa
 i was not ready to accept Lihaf as my king and Manto was insistent
 thodi hi der main lihaaf se bhi bad-chadhakar hamane bahes kar daali nihaayat khulkar, or mujhe tajjub hua ki manto gandi se gandi or bedaa se behuda baat dhad se is macooliyat or bholepan se kah jaataa he ki jhijak mahasoos nahin hoti
 While walking, he again mentioned his wife 'safiya'
 itani der ham baithe rahe or manto ko safia kii yaad ne kai baar sataaya
 "safia is a very good girl!" "safia cooks very good salons!" "" You will be very happy to meet her
 xxrep 4 ' bahut yaad aa rahi he, to use bula kyon nahin lete?'' maine kaha
 ''hey
 
 
 kya samajhati he, uske bagaiyr
 
 
 He started coming to his reality
 ''aapako safia se muhabbat he?'' maine raajadari ke andaaj main poocha
 "love!" He screamed, as if i abused him
 ''mujhe usase katai muhabbat nahin,'' usne kadava munh banaakar badi-badi putaliyaan ghumaain
 "I am not convinced of love
 xxrep 4 ' aap ne kabhi kisi se muhabbat nahin kii? xxrep 4 ' nahin! xxrep 4 ' or aapke kabhi galsue nikle

 There is also love with slippers and boots

 Yes, i was in love with my son, "he shrieked at the thought of the son and rose high on the chair
 ''khuda kii kasam, itnaa-sa pairon chalata tha

 ''magar vah mar gaya'', manton ne banaavati khushi chehre par laakar kaha
 "it is good that he died
" mujhe to usne aayaa bana daalaa tha
 If he had been alive, i would have washed his vessels today
 nikamma hokar rah jaataa
 i would have some work sachmuch ismat bahan mujhe usase ishk tha
 "while walking, he again said that" Safiya is coming

 "and my soul was happy to meet Safiya
 minuton main hamaari itani ghut gai ki sir jodakar gopneey baaten bhi hone lageen, jo sirf auraten hi kahati hai, jo mardon ke k non ke liye nahin hotin
 Manto had a habit of torturing himself, but usually dragged me along with me in front of me, and at that time, in my own world, except that i did not consider c adib
 agar ki si kii tarif k ro, to sulag uthta
 i would say, "you are not a critic who would listen to you" and he used to listen to the critics
 ek sire se unke vajood ko hi sime-kaatil samajhataa, khaastaur par adab ke liye
 "these people fuck!" He would burn
 jo yah kehete hai, bas uskaa ulataa karte jaao
 The same people, who object, read my stories secretly and rejoice instead of learning something from them, and then write oul-jalul in shame at the memory of that enjoyment

 If criticism does not help you, do not take it, but do not tarnish the general opinion, but it keeps tickling
 ek din daftar main garmi se pareshaan hokar maine sochaa, jaakar manto ke yahaan aaraam kar luun
 Then go back to Malad
 darwaja hasbe-mamul khulaa hua tha
 When you go and see, Safiya is lying flat
 manto haath main jhaadu liye satast palang ke neeche haath maar rahaa he or naak par kurte kaa daaman rakhe jhaadu chalaa rahaa he
 "what are you doing?" i looked under the table and asked
 ''cricket khel rahaa hum!'' manto ne badi-badi morpankh jaisi putaliyaan ghumaakar jawaab diya
 "take this, we thought, just relax with you, you guys are furious!" i threatened to go back
 ''are!'' safia uth baithi, ''aao, aao! xxrep 4 ' kaahe kaa jhagada tha?'' maine poocha
 ''nothing
 '' maine kaha-''khaanaa pakaana, gruhasthi vagairah mardon kaa kaam nahin
 Just as you get entangled with me, you also get confused that why not, it is the work of men
 main abhi jhaadu de saktaa hum
 "I stopped a lot, then fought more
" kehane lage, ''aisa hi he, to talaak le lo
 Safia said Basur Kar
 manto se jhaadu chhudaane ke liye maine banakar khansna shuru kiya, ''subah hi subah munispolity ke jhaadu vaale ne sehan saaf karne ke bahaane dhul halak main daal di
 Now take out the aspiration
 garmi ke maare jaan nikal rahi he
 Quickly leaving the broom, Manto went to the hotel to fetch snow
 safia handiya baghaarne chali gai
 Bringing snow, Manto smashed the towel on the wall and filled it in the plate and put it in front and sat down
 ''or sunaaie,'' usne hasbe-aadat kaha
 Handy pot boiled me out loud
 ''uffoh! yah safia kya jala rahi he,'' maine naak band karke kaha
 Manto looked at me with shock
 or chalaang markar jhapata
 Safiya was in the cook in the kitchen and then poured a pot of water into the pot
 waapas aakar vah sahamaa-sahamaa-sa kursii par baith gaya or phir kuch jhenpkar hans diya
 i kept looking like idiots
 safia badbadaati ai, to use jor se danta
 Then he said in a very shy way - "you have a baby in your stomach?" i immediately took a palm as if the child was not in me, but in his stomach
 jab safia ke pet main baccha tha, use bhi baghaarne se ubakaai aati thi
 "manto sir, don't talk like midwives for God," i said irritatedly
 vah jor se hansaa, ''are, vaah! isamen kya buraai he
 Hey, you like sour things

 manto us vakt filmistan main kareeb-kareeb sthaayee tha
 He looked very happy
 prashansa jo uski jindagi kaa sahaara thi, use milti thi ki uski film aath din kaamyaab na hui
 Don't know why he left Filmistan and went to Bombay Talkies with Ashok Kumar
 use ashok kumaar bahut pasand tha
 Mookerjee did not know what to tell him - he was feeding him
 pha ho gaya
 After going to Bombay Talkies, he also got me working in the company department for a year in the company and was very happy, "now we will write the story together
 tahalaka much jayega
 Mine and your story ashok kumaar hero
 Just watch again! ‚ÄùA story by Manto was under consideration
 ashok kumaar ko vah pasand thi
 Before that he loved the story of forced
 phir dil se utar gai or manto kii kahani pasand ai
 She liked my story stubbornly after my arrival
 khayr, manto ko nagavar na gujara
 When Ashok Kumar asked me to work on the story of Manto and Manto on my story! As a result, Manto started shaking with me and i with Manto
 idhar kamaal amrohi 'mahal' kii kahani lekar aa gaye or ashok kumaar ko vah pasand aa gai or ham donon kii kahani khatai main pad gai
 Now if there was only a question of respect, then there was more
 vahaan to yah haal ho gaya ki hamaari kahani nahin ban rahi he, to ham kisi ginati hi main nahin the
 We were told to sit peacefully
 tankhwaah milti rahegi, kyonki kantrect ho chukaa tha, lekin hamaari kahani nahin banegi, lihaaja, meri or shahid kii puri koshishen apni kahani ziddee ko banavaane kii taraf lag gayi or bagaiyr ashok kumaar ke duusare darje kii tasveeron kii qatari main ziddee banaai jane lagi
 But the story of Manto is left! Manto would sit in his room throughout the day and frantically recount his story
 kabhi anjaam ko aagaaj banaakar likhata
 Sometimes by making the debut
 kabhi bich se shuru karke aagaaj par khatm karata or madhya ko anjaam bana detaa
 Despite the story of thousands of operations, no one liked Ashok yesterday, but Manto would say, "you don't understand Ganguly
" main samajhataa hum
 He will definitely work in my story
 xxrep 4 ' aapaki kahani main uskaa role romantic nahin, baap kaa he
 He never will
 '' or manto se phir ladaai hone lagati, magar adbi jabaan se
 Here he was concerned, and that is what became stubborn and palace
 manto kii kahani rah gai
 Manto did not expect this and felt very bitter
 vah sab kuch jhel saktaa tha, bekadri nahin jhel saktaa tha
 His wife and children started calling him Pakistan
 manto ne hamase bhi chalane ko kaha
 The future is beautiful in Pakistan
 yahaan se gaye hue logon ko kothiyaan milengi
 We will be there
 bahut jaldi tarakkee kar jaaenge
 Manto got really upset at my answer
 itani ladaaiyaan or jhgade mere usase hue, magar yun kisi sanjeeda usul par bahes nahin hui
 And at that time i came to know how intelligent Manto is
 or ek din vah bagaiyr soochna die or mili pakistan chalaa gaya
 i felt very shocked
 phir jab uskaa khat aayaa ki vah bahut khush he
 Found a great house
 lanbaa-chaudaa or khubasurat
 Adorned with valuables
 hamen usne phir bulaayaa
 'stubborn' was over and we started 'arzoo'
 bure vakt aae the or chale gaye the
 Then he received two letters
 usne bulaayaa tha
 Had hoped to get a cinema allotted
 mujhe bada dukh hua
 i was convinced of his love even earlier, but now i had to agree even more, i tore his letters
 is baat se chidhkar ki vah mere usulon kii kadra kyon nahin karata
 i did not stop him from leaving
 phir vah mujhe apane raste par kyon ghaseet rahaa he?or aaj manto ke marane ke baad main likh rahi hum
 Not only did Manto happen a long time, a lot was dead between me and Manto
 aaj sirf ek kasak jinda he
 It is not known what is the problem? Is it regretful that he is dead and i am alive
 yah mere seene par phir karj jaisaa boj kyon he? mujhe to manto kaa koi karja yaad nahin, or uskaa karja bhi kya tha? yahi na ki usne mujhe bahan kaha tha, magar bahanen bhaaiyon ko dam todta dekh kuch kar nahin paatin
 The wounds of the dying are inflicted, which neither hurts nor leaks
 khamosh sulagta rahata he
 Have you not come from the tribes? Just drag themselves and drag their loved ones into the swamp
 
 
 or phir ek din akelaa chhodkar chal dete hai
 Sister, this is not the habit of the odd ones, millions of crores of people of our country are victims of failure and failure in life
 na jane dil kyon kahata he ki manto kii us jawan maut main meraa bhi haath he
 There is no visible splatter of blood on my hand, which only my heart can see
 vah duniya, jisane use marane diya, meri hi to duniya he
 Today let him die and tomorrow i will be allowed to die like this
 or phir log matam karenge
 The burden of my children will become a rock on their chest
 jalse karenge
 They will collect donations and no one will be able to come due to the busyness in those waters
 vakt guzar jayega
 The burden of the chest will become lighter and lighter and they will forget everything

 BJP President Amit Shah on Monday visited senior party leaders LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi
 is dauraan donon netaaon se unki ghante bhar se zyaadaki mulaakaat hui
 However, so far nothing has been known about what happened during this meeting
 amit shah somvaar shaam pehle murali manohar joshi se milane pahunche
 After this meeting that lasted more than half an hour, he met senior party leader LK Advani
 shah ne adwani se mulaakaat aise samay main kii he, jab unhone kuch din pehle hi ek blog main likhaa ki bhaajapa ne apane raajnneetik virodhiyon ko kabhi bhi shatru yaa raashtra virdohi nahin mana
 He said that the fragrance of Indian democracy is to respect diversity and freedom of expression
 sthapana ke samay se hi bhaajapa ne hamase raajnneetik asahmati rakhane waalon ko kabhi bhi apana shatru nahin mana, balki unhen sirf apana pratidwandvi mana
 Advani had said that similarly in our concept of Indian nationalism, we never considered those who were anti-national, who disagreed with us politically
 is tippanee ko modi ke netritv ko adwani kii taraf se ek sandesh ke rup main dekha gaya, jo pakistan ke balakot main kii gai air strike par sawaal uthaane waalon par rashtriya hit ke khilaaf kaam karne kaa aarope lagaataa aa rahaa he
 Please tell that this time the party has given Amit Shah a ticket from Gandhinagar in place of LK Advani
 yah seat 1991 se laalkrishna adwani ke naam rahi thi
 It is worth noting that a few days ago, in view of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the BJP had released a list of 40 star campaigners for Uttar Pradesh
 is list main piem modi samet kai diggaj netaaon ke naam hai, magar laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi kaa naam nahin tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti were among the bjp's list of star campaigners for Uttar Pradesh
 magar 40 star prachaarkon kii is list main laalkrishna adwani kaa naam nahin tha
 Not only this, Murali Manohar Joshi's name was also missing in it
 bataa den ki bijepi ne is baar laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi ko tikat nahin diya tha
 LK Advani is an MP from Gandhinagar, but this time BJP President Amit Shah has been given the ticket in his place

 a post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Apr 26, 2018 at 9:16am PDT Baba is in this country
 bade-bade baba satsangi mehfil se dur jail main band pade hai
 But this is the first time when a dispute has arisen regarding this mother of Baba among this group 
 or ye maa hai radhe maa
 Who ever went in the lap of the devotees, sometimes kissing, sometimes i love you, sometimes i used to collect headlines with my clothes
 par surkhiyon se hat kar ab inhone aisa kaam kar dipha he jo ab tak koi baba bhi nahin kar paaya
 She herself went to the police station and went to the police station and sat directly in the SHO chair
 ye alag baat he ki radhe maa kii is krupa ke baad esechao samet chah police vaale nap gaye
 The pictures of Radhe Maa that came out of a police station in Delhi will surprise everyone
 tasviir main vivaadaaspad dharmaguru radhe maa dikh rahi hai
 Some policemen in the room are also seen in the posture of the devotee
 dharm acha he
 Spirituality is also good
 bhakthi karnaa or mahilaon kii izzat karnaa to bahut hi acha he
 But what is it that while doing devotion, a government officer should go so far that he should not take care of the place of devotion and the d√©corum of his duty or say that the rules and regulations
 dilli ke vivek vihaar thane ke tasviren usee kaa subut hai
 Radhe Maa, who is often surrounded by controversies, sat in the chair of Thane with full vigor and how Sanjay Sharma, the Thanedar, stood with his hands folded
 ye vahi radhe maa hai jo haath main trishul lekar apane bhakton ke bich ajab-gajab mudra ko lekar charchit rahati hai
 Radhe Maa was sitting on the chair in the room of the police station where SHO chair should have been inspector Sanjay Sharma
 khaaki vardi kii izzat se beparwaah daaroga sahab bhakt kii mudra main haath jode radhe maa ke saamne abhibhoot se khadey the
 The SHO has placed Matarani's pick on the uniform
 maano wo apane kartavyon ke mandir yani thane main naa hokar kisi devi ke mandir main khadey hon
 When the head of the police station has this condition, then how would the other policemen stay behind
 radhe maa kaa aashirwad lene ke liye wo bhi qatari main lag gaye
 This picture of Vivek Vihar police station is of Mahashtami during Navratri
 is bare main jab hamane esechao se baat karne kii koshish kii to wo kanni kaat gaye
 a constable of the police station says that Radhe Maa came to Ramlila
 kaaphi bheed jutane kii vajah se esechao sanjay sharma unhen thane le aae
 Radhe Ma has a relationship with Choli Daman
 kabhi wo apane tang kapadon kii vajah se charche main rahati hai, kabhi sant kaa chola pahan kar ashleelata failaane ke ilzaam kii vajah se, to kabhi aadhi raat ko kisi ko phone kar daraane dhamkaane kii vajah se
 But still the devotees of Radhe Maa range from ordinary people to many celebrities
 radhe maa kii shaadi punjab ke hoshiyarpur main hui thi
 The husband owned a sweet shop
 lekin dhandhe main ghaataa kya hua, pati ne kamai ke liye khadi deshon kaa rukh kar liya
 Here, Radhe came in contact with a Baba and after taking initiation became Radhe Ma directly from Babbo and then Radhe Ma did such acts which continued to make headlines

 If Shikhar Dhawan does not play in the last ODI against Sri Lanka, then Ajinkya Rahane can be replaced with Rohit Sharma for the opening
 ajinkya rahane ne srilanka ke khilaaf maujuuda vanade siries main ek match bhi nahin khelaa he
 In such a situation Ajinkya Rahane may get a chance in the ODI team in the absence of Shikhar Dhawan

 Sri Lankan problems escalate, Sri Lanka is in danger of losing the second consecutive ODI series to India 5‚Äì0

 He has defeated Zimbabwe twice since losing the last ODI series to India
 bharat ne isse pehle newjiland ko 2010-11 main or england ko 2012-13 main 5-0 se haraaya tha
 England is the only team that has lost to India 5‚Äì0 twice
 yadi bhartiya team srilanka ko ye match bhi haraa detii he, to is list main uskaa bhi naam jud jayega
 After Kohli scored a big win in the fourth match of the Experiment in the playing XI, captain Virat Kohli has indicated that changes can be seen in the fifth ODI as well

 Namvar Singh was also one of the people who contributed in this huge process of building a better member of the Sahitya Academy, given to the famous critic Dr
 Namwar Singh
 hindi ke puraane paath ko unhone nai shakl di
 Taught to read Shadowism from a progressive point of view
 nai kavita ke pratimaan gadhe, duusari parampara kii khoj kii, aalochana kii ek puri samskruti khadi kii jisamen vaad-vivaad or samvaad kii mahati bhoomika thi
 He created standards of teaching in the newly emerging universities of the country
 sagar or jodhpur ke vishvavidhyalayon main unki koshishon kaa virodh bhi kiya gaya
 At Jawaharlal Nehru University, he created a completely new language course which has remained standard in its own way

 hindi sahitya main jo vam, pragatisheel or pratirodh kii parampara he, vah namvar singh kii upasthiti or unke saannnidhya main hi phuli-fali
 He was reciting poetry and his police were kidnapping the poet
 What makes Namvar Singh unique and unique in the criticism tradition of Hindi is his universal publicity

 He wrote books, wrote articles in newspapers and magazines, edited literary magazines, was made editor-in-chief of the professional group Sahara Samay and also participated in literature discussions on TV

 namvar ji un sampadakiyon ko bahut pasand karte the
 He finds out who writes this editorial
 iske baad meri kuch tippaniyan bhi unhone dekhin
 When i first met him, he was equipped with all the information about me
 yah mujh par unki koi alag krupa nahin thi, unka swabhaav tha
 He used to engage in reading and knowing young people
 baad main mere pehle kahani sangrah 'uske hisse kaa jaadu' ke locarpan ke avasar par ve aae
 He also discussed some stories in the coming days
 2008 main main pustak meley se ek kaarykram pustakon par kar rahaa tha
 On my request, Namvar ji attended that program
 yah silsilaa aane vaale dinon or kai duusare mauqon par bhi jari rahaa
 Whenever he met, he met with immense enthusiasm and always insisted on writing something new
 sadak par mamata banerjee, kathghare main koun
 
 
 ? This was the period when Namvar ji was not writing
 tivi par unhone saptahik pustak charchaa shuru kii
 He would discuss a book every week with Mukesh Kumar and then Madan Kashyap
 hindi ke sansar main achaanak yah kaarykram mahatvapurn ho uthaa
 The author would have been grateful for the book on which Namwarji would have spoken for five minutes
 yah sach he ki namvar ji haal ke varshon main lagaataar shithil padate ja rahe the
 His body was not supporting him, his memory was not supporting him
 is lihaaj se yug kaa avsaan pehle hi shuru ho chukaa tha
 At the age of 93, he had a head injury and was dying from death
 sabko maaloom tha ki ab bahut dinon tak unka sath nahin milanaa he
 But when the death curtain has fallen, then more than mourning is felt
 yah ehsaas is baat se kuch or bada ho gaya he ki yah daur lagaataar vichaarviheen barbarta kii taraf bad rahaa he
 In the name of country and religion there is a fearful zeal like destroying all the chemicals of thought and sensation
 aise main jin vrikshon se hamen kuch pranavayu milti thi, ve hamase dur hote ja rahe hai
 To go to Namvar is also to draw attention to the fact that we have to fight our ideological battles by ourselves, and its tools will have to be re-invented

 Maggie was missing from the big days, especially when she did not feel like cooking something
 jhatpat pakane vaali megi kai baar yaad ai
 Although i have never been very fond of Maggie, i was not even averse to eating as a last minute food
 aaj jab bombai hoicourt se megi par lagi pabandi sashart hatane kii khabar ai to hazaron karod ke kaarobaar vaali nestle india ke liye isse acchhee khabar nahin ho sakati thi
 The important thing is that the High Court has admitted that the basic principle of justice has been overlooked in banning food regulators
 yani food regaulator FSSAI ne megi kaa paksh sune bagaiyr is par pabandi laga di
 Is Maggie really unfair? Did the FSSAI hastily put this huge restriction on a weak foundation on this multinational company's highly popular product? kamazor neenv kaa mudda uthta he bombai hoicourt kii us tippanee se jisamen kaha gaya he ki jin laboratory kii jaanch ke aadhaar par ye pabandi lagaai gai wo jaanch ke liye adhikrut hi nahin thim
 Was the FSSAI not aware of this or did it not notice it? hoicourt ne kaha ki abhi tak FSSAI kii jaanch jin lab se hui wo National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) se sambhddha nahin hai
 Therefore, it should be checked with authorized Mohali, Jaipur and Hyderabad labs
 jaanch honi he lead yani sisa kii maatra kii
 The findings of the US and UK FDA, ie the Food and Drug Administration, about the amount of lead, make Maggie safe

 It is natural to take seriously the statement of the country's food processing minister
 aakhir sarkaar khud hi santusht nahin he to phir sanstha kii vishwasaneeyata par to sawaal khud bhi khud uth jaataa he
 By the way, the government also showed amazing action about Maggi
 ek din pehle hi aniatik tareeke se kaarobaar karne ke aarope main sarkaar ne megi banane vaali nestle india par 640 karod kaa daawa thok diya
 This is an unexpected step by the government in terms of matters related to food items

 This requires shaking up the structure of our food regulation on a large scale

 Today's decision on Maggi has given Nestle India an opportunity to say that the samples made in our India have met internationally, the Indian Food Regulatory Inquiry has not been successful
 jo bhi ho megi kii vaapasi 6 hafton ke baad nateezon ke aadhaar par mumkin he to 2 minute main taiyaar hone vaali megi ke liye kya aap phir apni rasoi ke darvaaze kholenge?

The issue of weak foundations arises from a comment by the Bombay High Court stating that the laboratories whose restrictions were imposed on the basis of investigation were not authorized for investigation
 kya khud FSSAI ko isaki jaankaree nahin thi yaa is par usne gaur hi nahin kiya
 The High Court said that the labs that FSSAI investigated so far are not affiliated with the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)
 isliye isse adhikrut mohali, jaipur or hyderabad lab se jaanch karai jaae
 The amount of lead is to be examined
 Lead kii maatra ko lekar america or britain ke FDA yani food and drug administration kii jaanch ke nattejey megi ko surakshit bataate hai
 Maggi made in India is going on sale in many countries including Singapore
 america jaise deshon main khaane kii chizon ke maapdand behad sakht hai
 There, the question has been raised in many of our labs because of its coming within the scope of fixed standards
 hamaare desh main hi goa main kiye gaye sample jaanch main khare paae gaye
 So whether the samples were different or how the results of the same sample were different
 nestle india kaa daawa he ki megi ke 2700 sample bharat or duniyabar main jaanch ke daayre main aae hai or har jaanch main lead kii maatra tay maanak se kam mili he
 The second question is on the authority of the food regulator
 kya FSSAI ko kisi product ko bain karne kaa adhikaar he? ye sawaal nestle india ne apni arzi main uthaaya tha
 After Maggie Bain a few weeks ago, Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal called FSSAI a white elephant which is spreading fear in the food industry
 desh kii food processing mantri ke bayaan ko gambhirtha se lenaa laazmi he
 After all, the government itself is not satisfied, then the question arises on the credibility of the institution itself

 iske liye bade paimaane par hamaare food regaullation ke dhaanche ko jhakzorne kii zarurat he
 The criteria should be such that the claims of any company on the investigation and results cannot be sustained
 aaj ke megi par aae faisle se nestle india ko ye kehane kaa mauka mil gaya he ki hamaare bharat main banaae sample antarrashtriya str par khare utre hai, bhartiya food regular kii jaanch hi khari nahin hai

 " tibet main buddha dharm ke aadhyatmik guru dalai lamas ne kaha he ki unke dehanth ke baad bharat main unka avatar ho saktaa he, jahaan unhone apane nirvaasan ke 60 saal gujaarey hai
 The Dalai Lama has also expressed apprehension that he may posthumously have two Dalai Lamas, one of whom will be from an independent country (india) and the other chosen by China
 dalai lamas ne chetavanee di he ki china dwaara namit kisi anya uttaradhikari kaa sammaan nahin kiya jayega
 Experts believe that the announcement of the next Dalai Lama on behalf of China could create a very uncomfortable situation for India which could be worse than the Nehru era
 china ne dalai lamas ke is elaan ki china kii ore se namit shaks kaa sammaan nahin hoga, ko khaarij karte hue kaha he ki punaravataar kii tibeti buddha dharm main sadiyon puraani reeti he
 It has a certain ritual and tradition
 chini videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa geng shuang kaa kahana he ki ham tibeti buddha dharm ke in tareeke kaa sammaan or sangrakshan karte hai
 There is a tradition of re-incarnation for hundreds of years
 14wein dalai kii manyata bhi dharmik reeti-rivaaj se hui thi or china sarkaar ne unhen manyata di thi
 Therefore, the revival of the Dalai Lama should follow national rules and religious customs
 china sarkaar kii dharmik aasthaa kii swatantraaa kii ek niti he
 The Dalai Lama has told news agency Reuters that China considers the rebirth of the Dalai Lama very important
 unhen agle dalai lamas ke bare main mujhase adhik chintaa he
 In the future, if you see two Dalai Lama come, one from here, in the free country, one is chosen by the Chinese, no one will trust, no one will respect (the Dalai Lama chosen by China) 
 isliye yah chiniyon ke liye ek alag samasya he! sambhav he, yah ho saktaa he
 Professor Alka Acharya of the Center for east-asian Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says that China considers Tibet as its own
 tibeti buddha dharmaguru ko apana aantarik maamla maanata he
 If the Dalai Lama went and announced his avatar in India on the go, China would not accept the next Dalai announced by him
 aisi paristhiti main bharat kya karegaa?professor alka acharya kaa kahana he ki bharat ke liye yah sthiti nehru yug se bhi buree hogi
 Because no matter how good and bad the 14th Dalai Lama is, China believes that he is the Dalai
 buddha dharm main dalai lamas kii bhoomika lagbhag waisi hi he jaisi hindu dharm main shankaracharya kii hoti he
 China has a large population of Buddhists
 aaj bhi vahaan ke log aadhyatmik gyaan ke liye dalai lamas kii sharan main hi aate hai
 The 14th Dalai Lama of Tibetan Buddhism had to seek refuge in India after a rebellion against Chinese rule in early 1959, and since then the Dalai Lama has been seeking global support for linguistic and cultural autonomy in his remote and hilly homeland
 Have been working for bataa den ki 1950 main china ne tibet ko apane niyantran main le liya tha or 14wein dalai lamas ko vah algaavvaadi maanata he
 No matter how good China may say about the 14th Dalai Lama, but Tibetan accepts his recognition as a Buddhist teacher

 The Dalai Lama himself has expressed his apprehension
 aisi paristhiti main bharat ke saamne yah duvidha hogi ki wo dalai lamas kii ore se ghoshit avatar ko maane yaa china kii taraf se ghoshit dalai lamas ko

 Manmohan Singh will attend the seventh G20 summit in the resort city of Las Cabos, Mexico on 18 June and the Rio-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro

 Manmohan said, "continuing the problem will further weaken the global market and adversely affect our own economy
 ham ummid karte hai ki europea netaa puri patibaddhta se unke samaksh pesh aa rahe vittiya sankat ke samaadhaan ke liye pahal karenge

 India is pursuing this objective as the co-chair of the Working Group on 'strong, Viable and Balanced Development Framework'

 After Anna Hazare's movement, there is a campaign against corruption everywhere in the country
 isi bich, ek aankada saamne aayaa jo dilli police kii khaaki ko daagdar kar rahaa he
 In just five months, there have been twenty four serious cases of corruption in Delhi Police
 ye khulaasa kiya he grih rajyamantri mallapalli ramchandran ne loksabhaa main ek sawaal ke jawaab main
 Special coverage on the movement against corruption The truth about the Delhi Police which was covered and hidden is now exposed in the form of the document
 is saal april se agast tak dilli police ke 47 mulajimon par laga he bhrashtachar main shaamil hone kaa gambhir ilzaam
 Read what is the Jan Lokpal Bill against corruption? In response to a question in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Home Mullappally Ramachandran said that 47 police personnel include 25 constables, 9 head constables, 7 ASI, 6 SI and 1 inspector rank officer
 The surprising thing is that a case of negligence in work is also included against about 1800 police personnel
 hairaani kii baat he ki ye aankada 24 maamalon kaa he or iskaa akalan 5 maheenon main hi kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, it can be guessed that if this figure were somewhere a year or above, then its number could have been quite large

 At the same time, the lawyers' performance in Delhi continues
 is bich ek vakil ne rohinee court main aatmadah kii koshish kii he
 On Tuesday, Delhi Police personnel performed the police headquarters
 ek ore supreme court main vakil varun thakur ne is maamle ko lekar dilli police kamishnar amuly patnayak ko legal notice bheja gaya he
 On the other hand, a lawyer has tried self-immolation in Rohini court
 aise main donon pakshon kii mili juli pratikriya saamne aa rahi he
 Criminal lawyer Sanjeev Chaudhary, who has been practicing in the Patiala House Court for nearly 10 years on this issue, says, "those who have filed non-beliable firs should be arrested
" 'unhone sawaal uthaate hue kaha, 'jab kaale kot or safed kameez vaale ko giraftaar karaane kii baat kah rahe hai to kya khaaki vaale ko giraftaar nahin hona chahie
 'arrested as the one who fired the bullet, the same lawyer SN Sharma said,' Any man who shoots at anyone should go straight to jail
 yahaan par investigeshan ho chukaa he
 The man did not go to jail because he is in the police
 use bachaaya ja rahaa he isliye strike khatm nahin ho rahi
 The Bar Council of India may have appealed to end the strike, but the leader of the Coordination Committee
 unka aadesh ab tak nahin mila he
 It is worth mentioning that a case of murder is registered against the accused of shooting a lawyer in Tis Hazari Court, which is non-bailable, that is, the accused gets bail not from the police station but from the court itself
 Under it comes the Bar Association of all the districts of Delhi and about 22000 lawyers are covered under it
 dilli police ke asipi veda bhushan kaa kahana he, 'jab maamla nyaayik jaanch ke liye bhej diya gaya he

 ' The two-day summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has raised hopes of peace seekers in South Asia
 essio ke lirders lounj main pradhanmantri narendra modi or imran khan ke bich anaupchaarik abhivadan wo kadi he jisase bhavishya ke liye ummiden bandha gai hai
 However, diplomacy experts say that there are many issues like Pakistan's prior record, India's bluntness on terrorism, due to which there is little hope of melting the ice on the relationship between the two countries in the near future
 nai shuruyaat kar paaegaa sco?shanghai sahyog sanghathan ke forum se bharat ne ek baar phir aatankwaad par apana rukh spasht kar diya he ki pakistan jab tak aatankwaad ko samarthan or panaah dena band nahin karata he padosi ke saath baatcheet mumkin nahin he
 After the attack on Pathankot airbase of India in January 2016, India has given a sharp message to Pakistan that till then the jaish-e-mohammed does not take strong and clear action against terrorist organizations like lashkar-e-taybba, till then the mail -there is no scope for a millipede
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke duusari baar shapath lene ke baad piem imran khan ne bharat se teen baar baatcheet shuru karne kii pahal kii
 After Narendra Modi's victory, Imran Khan tweeted and congratulated him, after which he called PM Modi
 iske baad ek baar phir unhone bharat ko vaarta shuru karne ke liye chitthee likhi
 But the shadow of this intention of Pakistan was neither seen on the international border in Jammu and Kashmir nor the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
 pichley kuch dinon se jammu-kashmir main seemaa rekha par pakistan kii ore se firing bad gai he
 a Pakistani soldier Mohammad Javed was also martyred in Pakistan's firing
 imran ne kiya jammu-kashmir kaa apratyaksh zikrapakistan jab bhi bharat se baatcheet ke liye pahal karata he wo jammu-kashmir kaa bagez peeth par laade rahata he
 Pakistan's same antics show how serious it is to improve relations with India
 essio main apane sambodhan main jammu-kashmir kaa apratyaksh zikr karte hue imran khan ne kaha ki pakistan aatankwaad ke har rup kii ninda karata he, isamen sarkaar pryojit aatankwaad bhi shaamil he
 History of deception on the pretext of negotiation The biggest danger in starting negotiations with Pakistan is the maliciousness of Pakistan
 itihaas gavaah pichley kai maukon par bharat ne jab-jab pakistan se baatcheet shuru karne kii koshish kii badale main uskaa seenaa chalni kiya gaya
 Pakistan is badly plagued with its old-fashioned sense of deceit on the pretext of negotiation
 is kadi kii shuruyaat purv piem atal bihari vaajapeyi kii charchit lahore bas yatra se hi shuru hoti he, jab kuch hi maheenon ke baad pakistan ne kargil kii chotiyon par kabja kar liya tha
 After this, incidents like Mumbai attack, Parliament House attack, Pathankot attack, are being looted by the alleged good intentions of Pakistan
 pakistan ko vishwapatal par ye bataanaa jaruri he ki usne saalon se kuch bhi aisa nahin kiya he ki uski chhavi ek jimmedaar nesan-state kii bane
 In contrast, the actions of Pakistan have been to incite terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, to give air to anti-india forces
 darasal hindustan se nafrat ne use pakistan ko ek aisi daud main jhonk diya he jisamen daudane se pehle hi wo ladkadaa gaya he
 The economy is thriving there, there is a continuous process of protest inside Pakistan
 pakhtoon bluechistan movement ne desh ke andar behaal khadaa kar diya he
 Apart from this, India has very limited its options as a punishment
 yaa to wo apane aatank ke kaarkaane band karke apni awam ko sammaan kii jindagi de or nahin to barood kii aag main apni hasti khaak kar de
 So if Pakistan does not show its true faith in terror, then this small meeting of Bishkek is not going to affect the relationship between the two countries

 On Sunday, at the book launch, for the first time, Hema Malini gave a statement regarding the relationship with Dharmendra and his first wife Prakash Kaur's son, Sunny Deol
 hema ne bataaya ki unke saath rishte achche hai
 After this statement, the question that has been going on for the last four decades is again renewed whether Hema and Sunny, Bobby Deol's relationship is better? What is causing the discussion? Actually, during the launching event, biography writer Ramkamal Mukherjee asked Hema Said media wants to know about her and Sunny Deol's relationship
 jawaab main hema ne boleen, "jab kitaab kaa naam biyond da dream girl he to book main un donon (sani-bobi) kaa zikr hona hi tha
 People wonder what kind of relationship we share
 bataa duun ki jab bhi jarurat hoti he, sani hameshaa saath hote hai
 When that incident (hema Malini's 2015 car accident) happened, Sunny was the first to see me
 wo sab chizon kaa khyaal rakhte hai
 The way they care for everyone, it shows how our relationship is
 "hema ji phir yahaan kyon nahin dikhe sani-bobi?hema ke bayaan ke baad charchaa he ki jab unke or sani ke bich aise tallukaat hai to donon ke parivaar saath kyon nahin dikhe
 Actually, when Hema's daughter was getting married, there was a lot of discussion about their relationship
 shaadi main sani-bobi ke shaamil hone ko par tarah-tarah kii charchaaen ho rahi thim
 Hema also said in a statement that sunny-bobby would definitely come to the wedding
 haalanki shaadi main donon nahin pahunche the
 It has been seen as a tussle between Dharmendra's two families for over four decades
 kuch media reports main ise parivaar ke andar dharmendra kii nijee haar bhi kaha gaya
 Actually, just before the daughter's wedding, Dharmendra asked sunny-bobby to attend the wedding
 lekin sani-bobi hema kii donon betiyon kii shaadi main nahin aae the
 What Sunny Deol's mother thinks about hema-dharmendra's marriage, read her statement, never seen together, according to sunny-hemariports, Sunny Deol and Hema's relationship has never been good
 donon ko saarvajanik manchon par ek saath nahin dekha gaya
 Although Hema has been talking about Sunny many times
 pichley dinon sani kii film par bhi hema ne acchhee pratikraya di thi
 Whom did Bobby run to stab? Hema Malinikya is just 8 years older than Sunny, because of the distance between Sunny Hema, Hema is the step mother of Sunny Deol
 dharmendra ne do shaadiyaan kii thim
 The first wife's name is Prakash Kaur
 reports ke mutabik sani-bobi or unki maa dharmendra kii duusari shaadi kii vajah se hema malini se naaraaz hai
 Hema married Dharmendra in 1980
 ek intervyuu main prakaash cor ne kaha tha, "ek aurat ke rup main main hema malini kii bhavanaaen samaj sakati hum, lekin ek maa or patni hone ke naate main aisa (dharmendra se shaadi) kabhi nahin karti jo unhone kiya

 aaj mobikavik kaa daawa he ki uske paas 2 karod se zyada yuzar hai or company kaa maqasad is aankade ko 10 karod or bhugtan ko 500 karod dollar ke paar le janaa hai

 That is, if the supermarket from which you buy goods is in the list of a mobile wallet company, then you can pay the goods only through mobile without any card or cash
 apni pratidwandi company petm se mobikavik ko tagdi takkar mil rahi he
 But Bipin is confident that after making three times progress from last year, he will soon achieve his separate position

 lekin vidhayak ne march 2017 ke baad kiraaya jamaa nahin karavaaya
 The woman alleged that the MLA vandalized her kothi, which cost about two and a half lakh rupees
 wo bhi vidhayak ne nahin diya
 When the woman went to ask for money from the AAP MLA, the MLA misbehaved, manipulated and pushed her, causing her to fall to the ground
 uske baad vidhayak ne peedita ko jhuthe cese main fansaane kii dhamkee di
 After receiving the complaint of the woman, the SSP of Roop Nagar constituted a SIT to investigate the allegations against the MLA, which was found correct after investigation

 Story: no-man's Land- Salaam Azadjayant Ghosh worked in a famous Bengali daily newspaper in Calcutta
 uske purakhon kaa ghar, bangladesh ke vikrampur main tha
 He was also born there
 vahiin ke hansaada kaali kishor hiskool main kai saal usne padhai bhi kii thi
 But just a year before taking the secondary examination, he had to move to Calcutta along with his entire family
 vah bhi saream din ke ujaale main nahin, raat ke andhere main
 They could not make room in the city of Ain Calcutta
 yah sambhav nahin tha
 At the back of Jadavpur, the mohalla named Santoshpur is taking shape, while those people also arranged for a place to hide their heads
 jaint akelaa tha
 He had no other siblings
 bas, maan-babu or vah khud! haalaanki hansaada main ve log apana sabakuch phenk- phankakar chale aae the, lekin jaint ke babuji kii kathin mehnat karne kii kshamta or maan kii budhimatta, un dinon us choti-si gruhasthi main prachurya bhale na laa saki ho, magar abhaav or kadaki se use zarur mukt kar diya tha
 Jadavpur University was close to his home
 jaint kaa vahiin padhane kaa man tha
 But even this could not be possible
 kalakatta vishvavidhyalay se baahar nikalate hi usne akhbaar ke daphtar main naukari kar lee
 Since he started to write a little bit, he had to go to the office of this newspaper on the pretext
 ab daphtar main kai logon se uski jaan-pahchaan or parichay bhi tha
 In the mid-seventies, when those people came to this Calcutta city, in a completely unfamiliar and selfless condition, Jayant started getting acquainted with new people
 yah jaan-pahchaan badhanaa uski laachaari thi
 After being uprooted from his roots, after moving here, he got ready to rejuvenate his roots
 lekin dher-dher koshishon ke baavjood, bahuterey logon ke liye vah bengal hi banakar rah gaya
 Jayant had also known very well that in future also he will remain unfamiliar
 khayr, ab vah is bare main bilkul nahin sochataa
 All this thinking is useless, that's why he no longer thinks
 chunki vah bengal tha, isliye bangladesh se judi, agar koi khabar hoti, to akhbaarawaale vah esinment use hi thama dete the
 There were not many Bengalis like him in office, and it was not so
 lekin or-or bengal logon ke mukaable, use bangladesh ke vishyon kii behatar samaj he, puure house main yah khabar prachaarit ho chuki thi
 Before leaving the office last evening, the editor summoned Jayant to his room
 vahiin baithe-baithe hi, usne apane kuchbihar ke pratinidhi se phone par baat kar lee
 Tomorrow he is going to Cooch Behar
 sampadak ne use sara maamla acchhee tarah samajha diya
 Fearing the fatigue of reaching Cooch Behar from Calcutta, he set out on the back of the motorbike of his district representative from Cooch Behar
 jab unki motorbike saatgachhi sarhad par bi
 s
 epa
 Coming close to the sun, the sun had rolled in the west direction
 anirvana ne apni motorbike, sadak kinare khadi kar di
 He was the Cooch Behar representative of Jayant's newspaper

 With the permission of the two, they both started moving towards the Bangladesh border
 bharat kii sarhad par bi

 Many of the soldiers, with their guns on their shoulders, were patrolling
 aamtaur par yahan bi

 epa
 Two of the soldiers used to be on guard
 lekin, aaj unki taadaad badhaakar das kar di gai thi
 Jayant first talked to the same people
 yah bhoomi, bharat kii seemaa ke paar, ek khaas bhoomi thi
 Someone had named this land - no-man's Land! Some people also affectionately call it the International Borderline
 is bhoomi par kisi kii bhi milkiyat nahin thi
 Neither of India nor of Bangladesh
 yah bhoomi paar karte hi bangladesh kii seemaa! vahaan se bangladesh kaa bhukhand shuru hota he! jis bhoomi par jaint kisi din rahaa karata tha
 But now, without a visa, he is not allowed to enter the country
 bangladesh kii taraf najar daalate hue jaint kii chaati haahaakaar kar uthi
 The country that did not accept him, who pushed him from his lap, why is he being so emotional for that country today? Why is there such an impulse for that country, Jayant asked himself
 iskaa jawaab bhi use apane andar se hi mil gaya
 Janmabhoomi is her mother
 vipareet paristhitiyon se apane shishu kii raksha karne ke liye, maan bahut baad use nirvaasan main bhejne ke liye laachaar ho jaati he
 That deportation be permanent, does mother ever want to herself? Despite this sometimes it happens! it happens ! The mother has no control over this situation
 maan to bas, asahaay-nirupay najaron se darshak bani rahati hai
 Her chest keeps bursting, yet she is unable to say anything
 kuch bolne-kehane kaa maahaul nahin hota, isliye usase kuch kaha nahin jaataa
 She keeps waiting for an auspicious day
 lekin vah shubh din phir nahin aata, balki parivesh or kalushit ho uthta he, or zyaada keechad-kaado main garq ho jaataa he
 The mother tries to comfort herself by thinking that despite being in exile, her children are safe, she is well
 uski god main lautakar musiibat kii zindagi bitaane se to behatar he ki vah nirvaasan main kushal-mangal rahe
 Mother continues to console herself thinking this
 haalaanki apane bachche ke liye, uski chaati fatati rahati he, vah takalif se tukade hoti rahati he
 Jayant came to stand on no-man's land
 uski bagal main anirvana! anirvana pichley do dinon is jagah kaa chakkar laga gaya tha
 The atmosphere here was well known
 yahan rahane-sahane ko jo log laachaar hai, unke bare main bhi vah jaint se behatar jaanata tha
 a total of 213 people, including women and children, are living in the no-man's land of the Satagachi frontier, Jayant once glanced at them, at that place
 un baashindon main daridrata kii chhap bilkul spasht thi
 Shadow of terror on faces
 khule aasmaan tale, kadakadaati thand main ve log puure chaar din guzarbasar karne ko laachaar rahe
 Accusing them of being intruders, India pushed those people towards the Bangladesh border, but Bangladesh has refused to take them back
 ve log donon deshon kii dhakka-mukki ke shikaar hai
 Sitting on the zero line of Satgachhi Sehrad, they spent the entire four days, being hungry and thirsty
 unamem se ek thi - noorjehan begum ! use yah nahin maaloom ki ghuspaithiye kise kehete hai
 They were rich in profession
 saanp kaa khel dikhaanaa, saanp pakadakar unhen apane vash main karnaa, saanp kaa zehar bechney ke alaava ve log or kuch nahin soch sakate
 Thinking ahead of this is beyond his control
 iske liye bangladesh, bharat, nepal, bhutan kii koi rajnatik simarekha, un logon par paabandi nahin laga saki
 They have no understanding of what a visa is
 yah samajhane kii kabhi zarurat bhi nahin padi
 Of these 213 people, no one saw the face of the passport
 un logon ke liye kabhi passport kii zarurat ho sakati he, yah baat kabhi unki kalpana main bhi nahin ai
 Jayant first took the initiative to talk to Nur Jahan itself
 us aurat ke badan kaa rang kaala tha, lekin twachaa khurduri nahin thi
 Skin smooth, soft, shining like a black grape! She continued to narrate her story in an uninterrupted break
 jaint aaj se pehle sanperon ke itane kareeb kabhi nahin aayaa tha
 In her childhood, two snakes, came to show snake-game, at the Hansada house, on a rainy day
 uske baad, vah kabhi, kisi sanpere ke itane kareeb nahin aayaa
 Today, he was talking to a snake for the first time
 kisi niri anpadh aurat ko yun jadtahin, bejhijak dhang se baat karte dekhakar, use behad tajjub hua
 At the same time, many little children surrounded Nur Jahan and stood up
 unamem se kisi ke badan par garm kapade nahin the
 In the harsh winter of North Bang, Jayant was feeling quite cold, despite being dressed warm enough
 farvari maheene kii shuruyaat thi, phir bhi kya hua ? is baar to yun bhi kaaphi kadak thand padi thi
 Winter had not given up completely yet, yet how could these children roam freely, without warm clothes
 samarthy or kshamta, insaan kii jarurat or badha detii he
 Two more children came and stood near Nur Jahan
 ek bachche ke haath main manjhole aakaar kaa ek saanp ! bachche kaa ek haath, saanp kii gardan par, doosraa haath saanp kii qamar par ! saanp ne fan kadh rakhaa tha ! saanp ke sir par alpana aanki hui ! yah alpana, saanp ke sir par janmajaat thi
 Such a fierce snake was not only frightening or frightening, not only for snakes, but also for their ten-eleven-year-old children
 vah to un logon ke saath dost yaa sangi kii tarah tha
 a sari was wrapped around the body of the second child
 kisi sanperan-maan ne shawl kii jagah is shishu ke badan par sari lapetakar, gale main girah laga di thi
 Sari swings over her body like an apron! Jayant, returning to these children, returns to his childhood days
 bachapan main uski maan bhi isi tarah uske tan-badan par sari lapet detii thi
 In the southern direction of his house, he used to sunbathe while sitting on a chestnut built around a coconut tree
 daliya main muramure or khajur kaa gud lekar, vah dhoop main baith jaataa tha
 Neighbors - The neighbors and the children would gather around him and share in the coveted sunbathing
 maan uske badan par jo sari lapet detii, usamen se haath nikaalkar, jaint khajur ke gud ke saath muramure chabaata rahata tha
 Leaving from the memories of his childhood, Jayant took his masterful news from Nur Jahan

 'on hearing the name of Vikrampur, the electric current ran inside Jayant
 uskaa man hua ki vah marjina ke baap ko bulaakar, usase baat kare
 But he suppressed his desire

 Apart from this, darkness will come down in a short time

 Beyond this, the woman might get off on talking more openly, which, despite being true, was not glorified
 jaint bhi ve baaten nahin sunanaa chahta tha
 He did not want to hear these stories alive
 vah kuch or aage bad gaya
 213 The group of women and men was not small
 sach to yah he ki yah kaaphi bada kafila tha
 But he was left behind for many days
 unke liye na nahaane-khaane kaa intejam, na shauchagaar kii suvidha ! kahin, kuch bhi nahin tha

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that from the inception of Jana Sangh, we all had a dream that Article 370 should be abolished from Kashmir
 jansangh ke sthapana ke samay se hi hamaare sansthaapak adhyaksh dow
 Shyama Prasad Mukherjee entered Kashmir without a permit, chanting the mantra of 'one country, two marks, two Vidhans, two pradhan nahi chalenge' iske baad unka kashmir main balidaan ho gaya tha
 Many times people felt that Article 370 is such a subject, which is only for writing, it will not go away

 He said that the historical mistake made by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru by adding Article 370 was a crime against the country
 ham sab jaanate hai ki bharat main vilay ke samay maharaja hari singh ne anuchhed 370 kii koi shart nahin rakhi thi
 BJP leader Chauhan said tightly that now he does not know why Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru loved Shaikh Abdullah so much? Iyengar had drafted this due to Nehru's interest and what was the current that brought terrorism into Kashmir
 kai varshon tak khun kii holi kheli jaati rahi
 Nehru made a mistake by taking the Kashmir issue to the UN, Shivraj Singh Chauhan also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has rectified Nehru's historical mistake
 jab pakistan ne hamalaa kiya tha, tab bharat kii fouj bahaduree ke saath ladi thi

 Then Pandit Nehru ceased unilaterally

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan raised the question that what was the need to take the internal affairs of our country to the United Nations? This was Nehru's biggest mistake

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) does not directly participate in politics nor contest elections
 iske baavjood sangh par aarope lagata rahaa he kibijepico remote se control karata he
 Not only this, when BJP comes to power, it controls policy and government
 in aaropon par sangh pramukhmohan bhagwatne pehali baar safai di or kaha ki unka sanghathan bijepi kii raajnneeti yaa uski sarkaar kii nitiyon ko nirdeshit nahin karata he
 The call does not go from Nagpur
 On the second day of the three-day conference organized by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Delhi, Bhagwat said that the perception that the call is made from the Sangh headquarters, Nagpur, and (between him and the government officials) is negotiated
 yah dharna isliye bhi he ki raashtrapati or pradhanmantri jaison kaa naata sangh se rahaa he
 Volunteers can go to any party Bhagwat also said that RSS never asks its volunteers to work for any political party
 unhone kaha ki sangh salaah nahin detaa he, balki maange jane par suzav pesh karata he
 However he did not name the BJP or any of its leaders
 aresas pramukh ne raajnneeti par sangh ke ruukh ke bare main vistaar se charchaa kii or daawa kiya ki sangh apane swayamsevakon ko kisi vishesh raajnneetik dal kaa samarthan karne ke liye nahin kahata he, balki unhen salaah detaa he ki ve desh ke hit main kaam karne waalon kaa samarthan karen
 He said that we talk about the interests of the country and if we have the strength then we insist on what we believe to be right
 yahaan chhipaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he
 We do this openly
 desh hit se samjhauta nahibhagwat ne kaha ki sangh jis baat ko desh ke hit main samajhataa he, us par jor detaa he
 He referred to the issue of illegal infiltration and said that his organization could stay away from politics, but would talk about such an issue as it affects the country
 aresas se vaicharik rup se sambhddha bijepi kaa naam liye bina bhagwat ne kaha ki unke sanghathan se aksar uski raajnneetik mahatvakankshaon ke bare main poocha jaataa he, kyon uske kai log ek party main hai or raajnneeti ke saath uskaa kya sambandh he
 Why do the Sangh people go to the BJP itself? Bhagwat said that it is asked why so many of his people are in the same party
 yah hamaari chintaa nahin he
 They have to consider why they do not want to engage with other parties
 ham kabhi bhi kisi swayamsevak ko kisi khaas raajnneetik dal ke liye kaam karne ko nahin kehete hai
 The opposition often alleges that the RSS intervenes in politics through the BJP
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne aarope lagaaya he ki hindutv sanghathan modi sarkaar kii madad se sansthaanon par kabja karnaa chahta he
 BJP should work autonomously Bhagwat did not directly mention BJP and said that many leaders are older and senior to him and more experienced in politics than his experience in RSS
 unhone kaha, 'agar unhen salaah chahie or maangate hai, to ham unhen dete hai
 He said that the RSS wants the BJP to work autonomously
 unhone kaha ki satta kaa centre samvidhan dwaara tay kiya gaya he or agar yah baahar se nirdhaarit hota he to unka sanghathan ise galat maanata he
 Bhagwat said that the Swayamvar of the Sangh is done with national interests and it does not believe in enmity with anyone and special friendship with any other

 BSNL has launched a new data tsunami offer, attacking private companies like Jio and Airtel
 is plan main company pratidin 1
 Offering 5GB of data to customers
 ye data graahakon ko 26 dinon tak diya jayega
 The company has priced the plan at Rs 98
 khaas baat ye he ki is ofer kaa phayda BSNL ke sabhi graahak uthaa sakate hai
 However, 3G speed is provided by BSNL in all the places except Kerala, while Jio and Airtel provide 4G speed
 BSNL apane 98 rupee vaale pack main 2
 Provides data at the rate of Rs 51 per GB
 joki jeeyo ke 149 rupee vaale plan main 3
 Less than 5 rupees per GB
 jeeyo ke is plan main 28 dinon ke liye pratidin1
 5GB goes to Datadia
 isi tarah airtel ke paas bhi 149 rupee vaala plan maujuud he, jisamen company 5
 Provides data at the rate of 3 rupees per GB
 lekin jeeyo or airtel donon companiyaan data ke saath-saath pratidin analimited wais kol or 100 SMS bhi detii hai
 Whereas in bsnl's Rs 98 plan, the benefit of voice calls and SMS is not given to the customers
 airtel ne haal hi main apane 149 rupee vaale plan main kuch badlaav kiya tha
 Now 28GB3G-4G data has been given in this plan
 haalanki is plan ko chuninda cirkilon main hi uplabdh karaayaa gaya tha
 Earlier in this plan, the company used to provide only 1GB of data during the validity of 28 days
 saath hi data ke alaava SMS or colling kaa ofer bhi diya jaataa tha
 But unlimited calling used to go only from Airtel to Airtel
 aise main is badale hue plan ko airtel kii taraf se bada kadam mana ja saktaa he
 Customs officials at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in the capital Delhi have seized a bag containing more than 100 passports, including passports of some Indians
 police ne bataaya ki haalanki usne isamen abhi tak koi maamla darj nahin kiya he kyonki use abhi tak ve passport nahin mili hai
 Police sources said the bag came from a Turkish Airlines plane during the third week of December and was seized by customs officials
 police sutron ne kaha, ‚Äò‚Äòunhone bag ko jabt kar liya or paaya ki usamen kaaphi sankhya main passport rakhe hue hai
 He wrote us a letter ten days ago and informed us about the bag being seized
 passport abhi tak hamaare hawaale nahin kiye gaye hai
 He said that the officials concerned are on leave and we have not received those passports yet
 yah puche jane par ki kya passport sangathit giroh ke ho sakate hai, unhone kaha ki ve is bare main kuch kah nahin sakate
 "we have to find out whether the passports are genuine or fake and whether there has been any tampering of them," said a senior police officer
 iske baad hi ham kuch kah sakate hai
 "the officer said that after getting the passport, they will file a case in this regard soon
