 In Agra, the competition in Gujjar politics has intensified after the Samajwadi Party sp's senior Gurjar leader and former Minister of State Ramaskal Gurjar joined the BJP

 Here the number of Gujjar voters in Ghaziabad, Noida, Bijnor, Sambhal, Meerut, Saharanpur, Kairana parliamentary seats is more than one lakh each and with their same strength, these voters are decisive in these seats
 pashchimi upi main jaaton se barabari rakhane vaale gurjar samaaj ke sabase bade or sarvamaanya netaa bhaajapa ke hukum singh the
 In the Kairana by-election held last year to fill the void created after the death of Hukum Singh, the BJP fielded her daughter Mriganka Singh but lost in a close contest to Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate Tabassum Hasan
 tabassum hasan, muslim gurjar samudaay se aati hai is vajah se unki puure gurjar samaaj main koi sweekaaryata nahin he
 The SP also made Noida businessman and Gurjar leader Surendra Nagar a Rajya Sabha member but he too could not become a popular leader of Gurjars in western UP
 kairana ke varisht kisaan netaa angad singh bataate hai “varsh 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main gurjar matadaataaon ne bhaajapa ko ekatarfa vot diya tha
 He was disappointed after the election when not a single Gurjar was made a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government of the state

 Vijender and Manish duo, who have a lot of influence in Gurjar society, can greatly help BJP in Saharanpur, Kairana Lok Sabha elections

 Pradeep Chaudhary with a clean image does not stand anywhere in front of Hukum Singh's status
 gurjar matadaataaon kii tis yah bhi he ki jat se barabari rakhane ke baavjood unke samaaj se koi bhi netaa rashtriya falak par apni pahchaan nahin bana paaya he
 Kairana veteran advocate Rajpal Singh says, “after Hukum Singh, the Gujjar politics has become directionless
 pashchimi upi main kai gurjar netaa he vah sabhi apane sthaneey kshetron tak hi simit rah gaye hai
 Like the Jat community, there is no unity in the Gurjar community
 yahi vajah he ki gurjar netaaon kaa sarkaar main pratinidhitiv na ke baraabar he
 "to arouse the Gurjar community's displeasure with the BJP, the Congress has prepared to field Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Payetal of the neighboring state of Rajasthan for the first and second phase of the election campaign in western UP

 He has a number of young bowlers coming and apart from that he also has bowlers like Mohammad Shami and Jaspreet Bumrah

 So there is no doubting in this, India cannot maintain its dominance in world cricket because they have good bowling order
 'australian ballebaajon aron finch, osman khwaja or steven smith ne haal ke samay main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Lee believes it will be important to see how quickly the Australian team adapts to England's wickets like other teams

 wo june or july kaa samay hoga or us samay wicket tej gendbaajon ke liye zyada madadgaar nahin honge
 'lee said,' That's why many people think it will be the bowlers' wicket, but it doesn't have to be so

 Both brothers karunaakar reddy or ji
 In addition to the election of Somasekhara Reddy, the party has given five more assembly tickets to the Reddy family in Bellary and Chitradurga, their iron ore strongholds

 Yeddyurappa, who has had a tumultuous relationship with the Reddy brothers, is far more outspoken
 unhone 26 april ko bangaluru main kaha, 'maine unhen (janardan reddy) or kai dusron ko maaf kar diya he, jinhone pehle mere liye mushkilen paidaa kii thim
 Their support will be helpful for us

 Very happy with the attention being received in the BJP, Reddy asks, "who says i was gone?" i have always been with the party

 Reddy is currently out on bail and has been barred from entering his own home district, Bellary
 lihaaja ve padosi jile chitradurg main prachaar kar rahe hai jahaan shriramulu molkalmuru seat (badami ke alaava) se chunaav lard rahe hai

 khaskar is baat se ki 31 march ko mysore main unke saath kisi bhi rishte se amit shah ke inkaar kar dene ke baad bhi ve prachaar main dikhaai die
 Insiders say that is the reason why Sharmasara Shah also canceled his election meeting of Bellary

 Bengaluru political analyst A

 Akshay Kumar is busy in the film Suryavanshi in these days
 film main unka ection avatar dekhne ko milegaa
 Akshay Kumar has shared many posters related to the preparation of the film on social media
 baat shuru karun, isse pehle jin sahiban ko mujhase jo shikaayat ho, pehle use kah len
 But keep in mind that if someone has taken possession of the land or whose house has been demolished on the street or whose house has some goon in jail, do not complain about not helping them
 mujhe kisi badmaash kaa vot nahin chahie
 Without their votes, even if i lose, there is no problem
 '' rampur ke dundai gaanv ke ek ahaate main yahaan se aath baar ke vidhayak mohammad ajam khan dhimi aawaaj main vot maang rahe the
 People surrounded them from all around
 peeche chhot gaye log gardan uchakaakar unki jhalak paane ko betaab the
 All the roads in the village were paved
 ahaate ke baahar din main bhi balb jal rahaa tha
 Azam continued to meet people in the villages from late afternoon till late night
 unhen na sirf puure pradesh main party ke prachaar ke liye bhaag-daud kerani he, balki ruhelkhand main pehle se behatar pradarshan karke dikhaanaa he
 Actually, first Netaji and now Akhilesh Yadav consider Azam as the passer of this area
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main 15 farvari ko jin 11 jilon main voting honi he, rampur unke bich main padataa he
 Last time, the party had captured 34 of the 67 seats in the area
 bispi ko 19 siton par simatana padaa tha
 In 2007, BSP got 32 seats and SP got 17 seats
 yahaan siton kii yah adla-badali sidhe satta kii adla-badali jaisi dikhaai detii he
 The BJP had to win 10 seats both times and remain at number three
 2012 main amroha, muradabad or rampur jilon main cycle daudi thi
 The rest remained in the Swar seat of Rampur, from where Nawab Kazim Ali Khan (naved Mian) of Rampur won from the Congress
 alag-alag dalon se chaar baar se swaar ke vidhayak naved miyaan is baar hathi par savaar hai
 To demolish the Nawabi fort, Azam has fielded the civil engineer younger son Abdullah Azam
 ajam kii chhavi ke vipareet 26 saal ke abdullah khaase maasoom najar aate hai
 But his arguments have a sweet satire and family anger
 unki suniye, ''logon se main do hi baaten kah rahaa hum
 One, what did the Nawab give you besides gurbat and jahalat? Second: Every vote given to BSP will go to bjp's account
 hathi camel kii god main baithne ko utawala he
 "political pundits are calculating that Abdullah will defeat the Nawab on this seat, but in such a situation, this seat can go to the bjp's seat
" raat ke andhere main uttarakhand se sate swaar ke pipli nayak gaanv main iskaa jawaab abdullah ne yon diya, ''aap jin sadakon se chalakar yahaan pahunche hai, ve pichley dedh saal main yahaan bani hai
 Electricity has reached every village
 logon ko pehali baar lag rahaa he ki ve nawabi daur se jamhuriyat main pahunch rahe hai
 Babba (azam Khan) has done all this
 ''abdullah bhale swaar kii sadakon kii baat kar rahe hon, par is puure ilaake main mujffarnagar dangon ke baad buniyadi dhaancha teji se sudhara he
 The road from Moradabad to Bijnor is fast becoming four lane
 bijanour se mawana hote hue meerut jane vaala road bhi sarapat he
 If you can divert attention from the cranes who are bending in the shallow water of the Ganges, then you will find that Akhilesh really speaks in the area
 is baat kii tasdik bareli ke phuta darwaja kii us puraani haveli se bhi hoti he, jahaan nehru ke jamaane se vakt kii nabj ko pakad rahe shaayar wasim barelvi rahete hai
 Regarding Akhilesh, Barelvi says, "uttar Pradesh will be fortunate if this man comes back to power
" hamane bahut raajnneeti dekhi he, isliye daawey ke saath kah saktaa hum ki yah sant aadmi he
 “the small aspect of Barelvi's great personality is that the SP has made him a member of the Legislative Council
 par akhilesh kii bolti band karne ke liye bispi or bijepi ne koi kasar nahin uthaa rakhi he
 Take the political mood of Amroha, the city of Kamal Amrohi, who made memorable films like Pakija
 jile kii chaaron siten pichhali baar sapa ke paas thim
 This time Akhilesh's cabinet minister Mehboob Ali is having trouble even seeking votes
 yahaan ek sthaneey gangster kii hatya ke baad se turk birdari mehboob se aisi khafa he ki ve vot maangane jate hai to log gaali-galouj par amada ho jate hai
 Naushad engineers of BSP are giving them competition
 do-dhai sau kii bheed ke saath diduli gaanv main sampark par nikle naushaad kehete hai, ''shivakas kaa jhootha gaanaa gane se gundaraj chhip nahin jayega
 This time the BSP is contesting on two seats in the district, while the BJP is giving a tough fight on one seat
 tabhi bijepi kaa ek parivartan rath aata dikhaa
 He turned to the Hindu-populated area of the village
 rath ko bhaade kaa driver or tivi oparator, yahi donon sambhalate hai
 The operator ran a BJP promotional film on an LED TV there: "BJP be lava in UP, this time be a lotus feed
" '' 10
 The 46-minute film featured scenes of rioting violence, alleged exodus of Hindus and chilli masala like Mulayam Singh's 'boys are at fault' statement, but the achievements of the Modi government were summed up in a few seconds
 yani bijepi vipakshiyon kii ninda or hindu bhaawanaaon ko ubhaarne par hi jor de rahi he
 Then the party has given ticket to Suchi Choudhary from Bijnor seat
 ve pichley saal 16 sitambar ko yahaan ke peda gaanv main musalamaanon par hue hamale ke mukhya aaropee mausam choudhary kii patni hai
 Four Muslims were killed in this scandal
 mausam or 20 se adhik log tabhi se jail main hai
 Shubham Chaudhary, who is promoting Suchi, describes the case as "25 innocent people have been kept in jail
" puraa hindu samaaj ekajute he
 This time even Dalits will vote for BJP
 '' bijanour main pichhali baar bijepi or sapa ko do-do siten or bispi ko chaar siten mili thim
 Going to Shahjahanpur, the Congress is seen taking action
 vahaan kii sadar seat to khayr bijepi ke netaa sadan suresh khanna ke paas he, lekin tilhar se jitin prasad khud maidan main hai
 The congress-sp alliance in the district seems to be strengthened by the landing of a central leader
 pichhali baar yahaan congress kaa khaataa nahin khulaa tha
 These seat equations change like the mood of the season
 puraani sankhyikee chaahakar bhi kayaas lagane main bahut madadgaar nahin he, kyonki 2007 vidhansabha chunaav main bispi, 2012 vidhansabha chunaav main sapa or 2014 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi yahaan bulandi dekh chuki he
 2017 is different from these three
 to kya is baar dhruvikaran kii dhar se bijepi or musalamaanon ke bich kadi mehnat se bispi, sapa kaa khel bigaad degi? agle din prachaar abhiyaan par nikal rahe ajam khan ne jawaab diya, ''ham rishte jodpha jaanate hai
 Relations within the party have been added
 samaaj ko bhi jodenge
 Akhilesh ji is saying less, this time more than 300 seats will come

 kaam ko is tarah se karen ki aap unki praathamiktaaon se khud ko jod paaen
 2
 bos kii kharaab chizon par dhyaan naa den, unki positive chizon par dhyaan den
 With this one quality, you can come closer to your boss
 3
 Inform the boss about how well you are doing at work and what new plans you are making
 4
 It is not wrong to apologize if a mistake is made
 aisa karne par pataa chalata he ki aap ghamandi nahin hai or har vakt bos kaa feedback lene ke liye taiyaar rahete hai
 5
 lunch or coffee ke liye kabhi kabhaar aap bos ke saath baahar jaaen
 By doing this a good relationship is formed between you
 6
 Always remember that there is a boss above your boss too, whose job is to make your boss happy
 aise main apane bos kaa torget puraa karne main unki madad karen
 In this way, you will be elevated in the eyes of Big Boss and your boss
 7
 At the time when everyone in the office is praising your success, do not forget to appreciate your boss because no employee can move forward without the help and encouragement of the boss

 kai vaastudosha kaa nivaaran bhagwaan ganpati ji kii puja se hota he
 On the prayer of Vastu Purush, Brahmaji composed the rules of Vastu Shastra
 yah maanav kalyaan ke liye banaaya gaya tha isliye inaki andekhi karne par ghar ke sadasyon ko shaareerik, maansik, aarthik haani bhi uthaani padati he at: vaastu devtaa kii santushti ke liye bhagwaan ganesh ko poojana behatar he
 Vastu Devata cannot be satisfied without worshiping Shri Ganesha
 bina tod-phod agar vaastu dosha ko dur karnaa chaahate hai to inhen aajamaaie
 If happiness, prosperity and progress, if a statue or picture of Ekadanta has been placed on the main door of the house, then on the other side, put the statue of Ganesha at the exact same place in such a way that the two Ganesha's backs meet
 is prakaar se duusari pratimaa kaa chitra lagane se vaastu dosha kaa shaman hota he
 On the part of the building where there is a Vastu Dosh, the effect of Vastu Dosha is reduced by making ghee mixed with vermilion on the swastika wall
 dakshin va nairity kone or shri ganeshaghar yaa kaarysthal ke kisi bhi bhaag main vakratund kii pratimaa athwa chitra lagaae ja sakate hai, kintu pratimaa lagaate samay yah dhyaan avashya rakhana chahie ki kisi bhi sthiti main inkaa munh dakshin disha yaa nairity kone main nahin ho
 This has the opposite effect
 ghar main baithe hue ganeshji tathaa kaarysthal par khadey ganeshji kaa chitra lagaana chahie
 But keep in mind that while standing Ganesha has both feet touching the ground, there is a possibility of stability in the work
 bhawan ke brahm sthaan arthath centre main, ishan kone evam purv disha main sukhkarta kii murti athwa chitra lagaana shubh rahata he
 One should not put a picture of Ganesha, where people have to stop spitting etc
 sukh, shanti, samruddhi kii chaah rakhane waalon ke liye safed rang ke vinayak kii murti, chitra lagaana chahie
 every head
 vighnaharta kii murti athwa chitra main unke baayen haath kii ore sound ghumi hui ho, is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie
 Ganesha with a trunk rotating on the right hand side is obstinate and his worship is difficult
 jaruri he laddu or chuhaamangalamurti bhagwaan ko modak evam unka vaahan mooshak atipriy he at: ghar main chitra lagaate samay dhyaan rakhen ki chitra main modak yaa laddu or chuha avashya hona chahie
 In this way you too can remove Vastu defects by worshiping Ganpati without sabotage

 According to the information, Indrani and Peter have a joint account with Syndicate Bank in Mumbai and a bank in New Zealand

 He therefore sought permission from the CBI court to sign some papers on 1 February
 4 agast ko court ne ijaajat bhi de di
 But Peter's lawyers were shocked when they saw him
 peter ke vakeelon ne jab unase is kaagaj par hue dastakht ke bare main poocha to unhone isse inkaar kar diya

 The lack of facilities, poor government policies and the war of supremacy in sports associations have faded the performance of boxers

 Among them, Vikas Yadav of Bhiwani got Gold, Kamal Kaushik got Silver and Naman got Bronze

 ab tak boxing calendar jari nahin hua he
 Due to this, competitions in districts are also closed
 is par bhi sarkaar besudh he
 On the other hand, there is disappointment in Bhiwani
 hawa hote sapaneharyana main mukkebaaji kii 52 se adhik academiyaan or club hai, jinamein sarvaadhik 15 bhivani main hai
 The credit for popularizing boxing in Haryana is given to Hawa Singh, a Captain in the Army

 sanjay ke mutabik, unke pita hi jagadish ko gudgaanv se bhivani le aae the
 He started training at the Sports Authority of India's training center and Bhiwani Boxing Club

 Many times they do not even deserve to live a normal life
 '' unhone pradesh ke khel mantri vij se boxron kaa beemaa karaane kaa mudda uthaaya tha, jis par aaj tak kuch nahin hua he

 ) daaud ke ofer ko lekar daawa karne vaali report chhapane ke baad ek baar phir don par siyaasi halchal shuru ho gai he
 The then Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde denied any offer related to Dawood's return
 vahiin, purv piem manmohan singh ne akhbaar ke daawey par kaha ki daaud ke ofer ko lekar unhen kuch yaad nahin he
 But Chhota Shakeel, the closest to Dawood, made a shocking statement on his return
 daaud ibrahim kaskar
 It has been more than two decades for the Government of India to chase this name
 lekin, ab tak anderworld don ko waapas laane main hindustan kii sarkarein naakaam rahi hai
 Till now only a battle of statements has been fought
 tatkaaleen upie sarkaar or maujuuda endie sarkaar donon hi daaud ko hindustan laane kii koshishon ke daawey karti rahi hai
 But the result has been three parts of Dhaka
 scindia ke baad aayaa shakeel kaa bayanmumbai main 1993 main hue bam dhamaakon ke mastermind ko bharat laakar cese chalaane or use sazaa dene ko lekar bharat sarkaar kii koshishen us vakt shuru kii gai thim
 The evidence for this is found from the fact that the then Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde had said that his government is in touch with the US intelligence agency FBI
 scindia ke bayaan ke kuch din baad 26 sitambar, 2013 ko chota shakeel ne bayaan diya tha
 The report increased the political stir: The report of the offer to return to India two years ago has increased the political stir
 congress, bijepi or NCP teenon hi don ko bharat laakar uske khilaaf cese chalaane par jor de rahi hai
 Dawood Ibrahim's return to India has been a matter of politics and rhetoric for many years
 ab zarurat he, mumbai dhamaakon ke gunahagaar ko antarrashtriya str par dabaav banaakar hindustan laane kii he, taaki peediton ko puraa insaaf mil sake
 It was discussed at the high command that in 2013, according to the news of the English newspaper 'the Indian Express', a lawyer and Congress leader from Delhi told his party leadership that Dawood Ibrahim made a conditional offer to return to India
 is vishay par party or sarkaar main alaakaman str par charchaa hui thi
 In the 1993 Mumbai blasts case, Dawood wanted to face legal trials in India after two decades
 apni sharton par aana chahta tha daudadaaud ke is prastaav par purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh or us vakt ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar shivashankar menon ke bich charchaa hui thi
 The lawyer and Congress leader, who brought the news of Dawood's proposal, also spoke to at least two senior Congress leaders on the issue
 unhen kaha gaya ki yah siyaasi taur par visphotak mudda he
 It would be risky to run a trial against India's Most Wanted on its terms

 Huh

 Shaheen's 5th prediction has been proved wrong on Monday after four consecutive predictions about the FIFA World Cup
 germany se karaari haar ke baad yakeenan portugal kii team or unke phens ko bahut dukh hua hoga, lekin gam ke aansu se dubai ke registan main bhi garm ret par thandi barsaat hui hogi
 Perhaps this is why Shaheen was disillusioned during the prophecy on Tuesday
 shaheen ne brazil or mexico ke bich hone vaale match ke liye brazil par daanv lagaaya he
 Shaheen is unhappy
 somvaar shaam tak dubai ke registan main baithe is oont kii har karavat par duniyabar kii nazren thim
 fifa's crazy Shaheen began to be synonymous with Octopus Paul Baba, but with Shaheen's 5th prophecy proving to be wrong, people's faith has started to decline
 haalanki shaheen kii nai bhavishyavaanee ko lekar sabhi kii nazren aaj brazil par hongi, lekin neend to shaheen ko bhi nahin aegi
 Significantly, the last four prophecies of Shaheen proved to be absolutely correct
 shaheen ne ravivaar ko bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki argentina banaam bosnia or harjegovinia ke bich match main argentina kii jeet hogi
 Argentina beat Bosnia 2–1
 shanivaar raat italy kii jeet or usase pehle brazil va netherlands kii jeet ne shaheen ke andaaj main dam bhar diya tha
 The video of Shaheen's latest prophecy that came to the public from time to time, in which the manner of prophesying is clearly visible
 haalanki shaheen ne brazil or mexico ke bich hone vaale match ke liye brazil par daanv lagaaya he, lekin brazil ke chunaav main usne pichhali bhavishyavaaniyon kii tarah utsaah kaa pradarshan nahin kiya
 As had been the case so far, during the prophecy, Shaheen used to dent the board of his team of choice in the air, but on Tuesday he dropped the Brazilian board with just his mouth
 aise main ashanka jaahir kii ja rahi he ki portugal kii haar kaa gam shaheen ko sata rahaa he!baharhaal, ummid he ki agar aaj brazil kii jeet hoti he to shaheen kaa utsaah phir waapas aayega

 The incursion by Chinese army into Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir is nothing new
 saikadon kilometre tak faili is seemaa par abhi tak china or bharat ke bich main koi nishandehi nahin hui he
 But China's move and destiny is not hidden from anyone
 jo dhire- dhire bharat ke ilaake main ghus kar us par kabja jamaa rahaa he
 In 2013, the Chinese army, which had been living for several days in the Chumar area of ladakh, withdrew, but its nefarious intrigue is still going on
 bataa den ki jammu- kashmir ke ladakh kshetra main chini sena kii ghuspaith ke maamle zyaadaatar garmi ke mausam main saamne aate the
 But this year, the Chinese army has carried out the conspiracy to enter the Indian territory on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) even in the winter season
 philhal ladakh main china se lagane vaali seemaa par barf jami hui he
 Despite this, the activities of the Chinese Army on the LAC have increased
 vahiin bhartiya sena bhi apni taiyaariyon main teji laa rahi he
 The Indian Army has also deployed tanks along the border in view of the mobilization of Chinese troops on LAC in Ladakh

 narendra modi ne ravivaar ko ek baar phir pradhanmantri or congress par hamalaa kiya or kaha ki congress ne hi itihaas or bhugol badla he
 Modi arrived to inaugurate a Muslim trust's charitable hospital in district Kheda in Gujarat
 narendra modi ne pehle to swasthya ko lekar apana bhaashan diya
 After speaking for a while, he said jokingly that people have come here to listen to something else (his gesture was towards some political comments
 ) iske baad modi ne raajnneetik bhaashan shuru kiya or gin-ginakar pradhanmantri par tikhe hamale kiye
 Modi said, 'yesterday (on Saturday) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh gave a speech in Chhattisgarh
 acha hota yadi ve mahangaai ke vishay main kuch bolte, acha hota yadi ve bhrashtachar ko lekar kuch kehete, lekin durbhaagya ki piem ne itihaas or bhugol kii katha kii or chale gaye
 'I agree with the PM, talking high does not make success Narendra Modi, while attacking the Prime Minister said,' Yesterday you said that talking high does not bring success
 main 100 pratishat aapse sahamat hum or iskaa udhaaharan gujarat kaa chunaav he
 People accept reality, not things
 jo log baaten karte hai unhen logon ne satta se dur hi rakhaa
 it has been proven
 pradhanmantri ji bataaen, bhugol kisne badla?modi ke bhaashanon main kuch tathyon kii galati ko aadhaar banaakar congress ab tak itihaas or bhugol badalane kaa aarope laga rahi thi
 But on Sunday, Modi circled the Congress and mentioned emotional things about it
 narendra modi ne pradhanmantri se kaha ki bhugol to congress ne badla he
 Modi said, 'PM sir, the village where you were born, that village was once a part of India, but it is not now
 to aise main aap bataao ki bhugol kisne badla
 'modi did not stop, he said,' China has taken over our land
 jo jagah kabhi hamaari thi, wo aaj hamaare paas nahin he, aise main bhugol kisne badla?'gandhi ji ko chhod diya, ab gandhi maarg bhi chhodana chaahate homodi ne ek chitthee kaa zikr kiya
 Modi said, 'gandhi traveled to Dandi in 1930
 congress ke netaaon ne sabarmati se dandi tak kaa maarg (jis par gandhi ji ne ye yatra kii thi) ko heritage maarg banane kii ghoshnaa kii thi, dhan dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 But have not given the money yet
 dhan dene kii baat nahin he, sawaal doosraa he, sawaal yah he ki 6 maheene pehle congress sarkaar ne mujhe khat likhaa ki gandhi ji jis maarg par chale the, use heritage banane kii bajaay 30 kilometre thodaa idhar kar len
 So who wants to change history? ”clearly, Narendra Modi was in full form on Sunday and was attacking the entire Congress and its policies, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 swatantraaa sangram ko baghawat kyon kehete ho?narendra modi ne ravivaar ko aspataal kaa udghaatan karne ke baad kaha, 'piem ji, ham aapkaa aadar karte hai, lekin sach kahana hamaari majaburi he
 If it touches you, we can't do anything
 ' modi ne kaha ki 1857 kaa swatantraaa sangram sabhi dharmon ke logon ne sabhi birdariyon ne milakar ladaa
 It was a fight for independence, but till date the Congress calls it a rebellion
 kitabon main is ladaai ko baghawat ke taur par padhaayaa jaataa he
 Why? Modi referred to this in response to the allegations leveled against him, stating that Modi is not aware of history and presents false facts
 shaheedon, ambedkar or patel ko bhi bhula diya: modinarendra modi ne apane bhaashan main kaha, 'andaman nicobar kii jelon main rahane vaale shaheedon ko congress ne bhula diya
 Sardar Patel united the country, but what did Congress do for Patel? nothing
 nehru ji jab jivit the unhen bharat ratna diya gaya tha
 Indira ji also received the Bharat Ratna while alive, Rajiv Gandhi was given a year after his death
 lekin ambedkar ko unki mrityu ke 35 saal baad bharat ratna diya gaya, itani der kyon? sardaar patel ko 41 saal baad kyon bharat ratna diya gaya?'modi shyama prasad mukherjee, madan laal dhingada, abdul kalam aaazaad, jebi kriplani or shyaam krishna kaa bhi zikr kiya or kaha ki in shaheedon or vatan par mitane waalon ke bare main itihaas chup kyon he
 Finally, Modi corrected his mistake After completing his speech, Modi corrected one of his mistakes and said that due to fluent speech he repeatedly turned to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee while he was talking about Shyam Krishna

 jaane kya he jan lokapal?team anna ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki hamaare bill ko lekar bhaajapa ke man main jo bhi sawaal the un par charchaa hui
 To a large extent, the Bharatiya Janata Party has agreed with our bill
 anna ke andolan par vishesh kawarejprashanth bhushan ne kaha ki jin teen muddon par sarkaar ke saath gatirodh he us par aakhri faisla sarkari masaude ke saamne aane par ho paaegaa
 BJP President Nitin Gadkari, while giving full support to Anna Hazare against corruption, said that the Jan Lokpal Bill should be the basis of the Lokpal Bill to be passed by Parliament
 photo: anna ke liye sadakon par utre samarthakarajyasabha ke netaa pratipaksh arun jetali ne kaha,'bhaajapa ne pehle hi janalokapal bill ko lekar apana ravaiya saaf kar diya tha
 Our party wants the Prime Minister to come under the purview of Lokpal
 bill ko lagu karne ke liye samvidhanon ke praavdhaanon ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaae
 Information about the provisions of which our party does not agree has been given to Team Anna
 'arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar kii is samasya kaa hal baatcheet ke jariye nikaalnaa hoga
 Know who are Anna Hazare

 purv saansadon ko aaajeevan pension or alouns die jane ke maamle main supreme court ne centre sarkaar, chunaav ayog, loksabhaa or rajyasabha ke mahasachiv ko notice jari kiya
 The Supreme Court has sought reply on a petition filed against grant of lifetime pension and allowance to former mps
 haalanki sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne yah bhi kaha ki hamane vah jamaana bhi dekha he, jab lambey samay tak saansad ke rup main seva karne ke baad bhi kai rajanetaaon kii maut gurbat (garibi) main hui he
 The NGO, named Lokphari, has filed a petition saying that former pensioners and mlas are being given life pension while it is not included in the rules
 yachikakarta ne supreme court main kaha ki agar ek din ke liye bhi koi saansad ban jaataa he to vah naa keval aaajeevan pension kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he, uski patni ko bhi pension milti he
 At the same time, he is entitled to travel free in the train with a companion for life, whereas the Governor of the state is also not given a lifetime pension
 yahaan tak ki supreme court or hoicourt ke vartmaan jajon ko bhi saathi ke liye muft yatra kaa laabh nahin diya jaataa
 Even if he is going on an official visit
 aise main yah vyavastha aam logon ke liye boj he or ye vyavastha raajnneeti ko or bhi lubhaavna bana detii he
 If seen in reality, this expenditure is incurred on people who do not represent the people, therefore this system should be abolished
 lokprahari naamak NGO ne yachika daakhil kar kaha he ki purv saasandon or vidhayakon ko aaajeevan pension di ja rahi he jabaki niyamon main yah shaamil nahin he
 The petitioner said in the Supreme Court that if a person becomes an MP even for a day, he not only gets a lifetime pension, his wife also gets a pension
 saath hi vah jivan bhar ek saathi ke saath train main free yatra karne kaa hakdaar ho jaataa he jabaki rajya ke garvanar ko bhi aaajeevan pension nahin di jaati
 Even the current judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court are not given the benefit of free travel for companionship
 chaahe vah aadhikarik yatra par hi kyon naa ja rahe hon
 In this way, this system is a burden for the common people and this system makes politics even more attractive
 agar asal main dekha jaae to yah kharch aise logon par kiya jaataa he jo janata kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karte isliye is vyavastha ko khatm kiya janaa chahie
 The story of the film 'highway' begins with Alia Bhatt, Veera's house, whose wedding preparations are going on
 raat ke andhere main chhupakar veeraa ghar se nikalati he or apane mangetar ke saath sadak par ghoomane nikal jaati he
 His car stops at the petrol pump and as Veera gets out of the car, some kidnappers kidnap her
 unheen aparankartaaon main se ek hai, randeep hooda yani mahavir bhaati
 As soon as the gang learns that Veera is Amir Baap's daughter, the entire gang is terrified, but Mahavir runs on the highway from one place to another without putting Veera in his truck
 jald hi veeraa ko yah safar itnaa acha lagane lagata he ki ab vah waapas ghar janaa nahin chaahati, lekin asal vajah kya he, veeraa ke ghar na jane kii iske liye 'hive' dekhni padegi
 The film passes through capturing the beauty of the six states of the country beautifully
 aalia bhatta ne acha abhinay kiya he
 Randeep Hooda is also in the role of Jat of Haryana, but the story and screen play of the film is very weak
 nirdeshak imtiyaaj ali film main kya dikhaanaa chaahate hai yaa kya bataanaa chaahate hai, samaj se pare he
 The police search for the running truck and Veera has a good chance of escape, yet she hides and escapes the police
 film ke ek seen main veeraa or mahavir apane bachapan kaa raaj kholte hai
 It is revealed in this secret that Veera was a victim of physical abuse in childhood, that too from a family member of her own
 diarector imtiyaaj ali kai kaamyaab filmein bana chuke hai
 He has also made his mark as a director, but he missed the story of 'highway'
 ho saktaa he ki apni kahani se vah yah bataanaa chaahate hon ki bure kaam sirf sadakon par hi yaa chote log hi nahin karte, balki amiron ke gharon main bhi bure kaam hote hai
 Especially girls are not safe anywhere
 agar kuch is soch ke saath imtiyaaj ne film banaai he to soch to acchhee he, magar afsos kii isaki kahani kaa taana-bana vah thik tareeke se nahin bun paae
 My rating for 'highway' is 2 stars

 He attacked the Modi government and said that his intention is to weaken RTI
 centre sarkaar artiai ko kamjor karne ke liye apane bahumat kaa istemaal kar sakati he, lekin isse desh kii janata pasand nahin karegi
 In a statement issued on Tuesday, Sonia Gandhi said, "it is a matter of great concern that the Central Government is bent on completely dismantling the historic Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005
 yah kanoon salaah ke baad taiyaar kiya gaya tha or sansad dwaara sarvasammati se paarit kiya gaya tha, yah kanoon ab khatm hone ke kagaar he
 "explain that under the Right to Information (amendment) Bill 2019, the government can get the power to decide the salary of the Information Commissioners and other conditions of the job
 sarkaar ke kadam kii aalochana karte hue sonia gandhi ne kaha ki pichley 10 saalon se zyada samay main hamaare desh ke 60 saal mahila-purushon ne soochna ke adhikaar kanoon kaa istemaal kiya he or prashasan ke alag-alag staron par paardarshita laane kii koshish kii he
 Sonia said that because of these efforts our democracy has become very strong
 unhone kaha ki soochna adhikaar se jude kaaryakartaaon ne bade paimaane par is kanoon kaa istemaal kiya jisase garibon or haashiye par gaye logon ko iskaa phayda mila
 Sonia said, "it is clear that the current central government considers the RTI Act as an obstacle and wants to end the independent existence of the Central Information Commissioner, which was given equal status as the Chief Election Commissioner and Central Vigilance Commissioner in this law
" centre sarkaar sadan main apane bahumat kaa istemaal is uddeshy ko hasil karne main kar sakati he, lekin is prakriya main vah desh ke prayek naagarik ko kamjor karegi
 "however, the Center on Monday dismissed these doubts of the opposition and said that the government is committed to maintaining the autonomy of the Right to Information Act and its transparency

 In Delhi, pollution begins to increase a few days before the onset of winter and during that time there are big festivals like Dashara and Diwali
 aise main dillihoicourtne centre or dilli sarkaar se kaha he ki dashahara ke dauraan jalane valerawanke putalon se hone vaale pradooshan par cameti banaakar report taiyaar kare
 Already in Delhi, facing pollution, the pollution caused by firecrackers during the Diwali and Dussehra acts as ghee in the fire
 yahi vajah he ki dilli hoicourt ne dilli sarkaar or centre sarkaar ko ek cameti banane kaa nirdesh diya he jo yah tay kare ki teen-chaar maheene ke dauraan sardiyon main tyoharon ke dauraan badhane vaale pradooshan par kis tarah se kaabo kiya jaae
 The Delhi High Court is hearing a petition related to air pollution seeking control from the government and agency regarding the ever increasing pollution in the state
 somvaar ko bhi sunwaayee main yachikakarta ne court ko bataaya ki dashahara ke dauraan hi dilli main kareeb das hajaar ravan ke putale jalaae jate hai
 There are also a large number of firecrackers in the mannequins, which further increases the pollution level in Delhi during Dussehra
 sthaayee samaadhaan talaashe sarkaaris maamle par chintit hoicourt ne yachikakarta ko kaha ki 2 din baad hi dashahra he, lihaaja is saal to court kuch bhi karne main asamarth he, lekin agle saal ke dashahara se pehle centre or rajya donon sarkaron ko milakar iskaa sthaayee samaadhaan dhundhna hoga
 Now Delhi and the central government will have to set up a committee before November 22, whose task is to decide what are the main reasons apart from the firecrackers during the festivals, which is increasing the pollution
 saath hi un kaarnon ko kis tarah se kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The committee will also have to make guidelines on this
 hoicourt ne saaf kar diya ki pichley saal ke supreme court ke aadesh ko ab bhi dilli sarkaar or tamaam agencys ko lagu karnaa hoga jisamen pataakhon kii bikri par roak kaa praavdhaan he
 Data from various agencies that measure pollution have also confirmed that the use of firecrackers during Dussehra and Diwali increases pollution levels in Delhi by several times

 Even after the Punjab National Bank drowned about eleven thousand crores, the nationalized banks have not taken any lessons
 uttar pradesh ke bijness hub maane janevaale kanpur shahar main ek aisa hi maamla haath se nikal jane ke intjaar main he
 The businessman of Kanpur, Vikram Kothari, is accused that he owes around Rs 3,000 crore to five national banks and Kothari did not return any money from this borrowing
 iske baavjood naa sirf kothaari khuleam gum rahe hai balki unke bijness bhi badastoor chal rahe hai
 a little different from Mumbai's Nirav Modi, Vikram Kothari is accused of colluding with the top brass of the bank, showing him the value of his assets and taking a loan of crores of rupees on them and then refusing to repay them
 vikram kothaari rotomac pence ke maalik hai or kanpur ke posh tilak nagar ilaake me aaleeshaan bangale me rahete hai
 Vikram Kothari first took a loan of 375 crores from Allahabad Bank in 2012 in the name of his company Rotomac
 iske baad union bank se 432 karod kaa lone liya
 Not only this, Vikram Kothari took a loan of 1400 crores from Indian Overseas Bank, about 1300 crores from Bank of India and 600 crores from Bank of Baroda, but did not repay the loan of any bank
 aarope he ki bank adhikariyon kii mili bhagat se vikram kothaari bainko kaa lagbhag teen hajaar karod rupaya dabaa kar baith gaye
 His rotomac company was also locked
 bainkon ne vikram kothaari ke sabhilonke sabhi khaaton ko enpie ghoshit kar diya
 We tried to talk about the allegations at Vikram Kothari's house
 lekin ghar or offis kahin bhi koi baat karne ko taiyaar nahin hua
 When we spoke to PK Awasthi, the manager of Union Bank in Kanpur, he told that Rs 482 crore of our bank is left on Vikram Kothari
 hamaara yah lone unhone 2012 main liya tha
 Now his account has become NPA
 unase vasuuli ko ham log prayaas kar rahe hai
 By the way, four banks of Kanpur have outstanding loans of about three thousand crores, which has become NPA
 is ghotaale par jab bainkon kii aankh khuli to unhone apane mukhya karyaalayon main jaankaree dekar maamle se pallaa jhaal liya
 Even after a long time, the banks have not yet taken any concrete steps to tighten the screws on the closet
 sutron ke mutabik lone ke kuch maamle mediation main jarur chal rahe hai, jiske chalate bank ne kothaari kii jamine atech kii hai or sau karod rupee ke lone kii recovery kii he
 Vikram Kothari apparently does not have enough property to redeem the loan so that the entire loan can be repaid
 jaahir he ek baar phir bank adhikariyon or jaalsaajon ke gathjod se karodon rupee doobnevaale hai
 Surprisingly, the bank kept giving crores of rupees to Vikram Kothari for a long time
 kisi ne kothaari ke bare main pukhta jaanch hi nahin kii
 It is alleged that Kothari has invested in the purchase of some companies and properties abroad
 elaes hove se pehle log kapade to jarur pahante honge lekin shaayad ve kapade utane khubasurat or fashneble nahin hote honge

 sarkaar ke kisaanon se sidhe kharid kar bazaar main maal bechney ke khilaafrajasthande 274 anaaj mandiyon main shanivaar se hadtaal shuru ho gai he
 Traders have started protests by shutting down all the grain markets of the state, alleging that no one is coming to the traders in the mandi due to the government selling the market at a much lower support price
 rajasthan khaadya vyapaaree sangh ke adhyaksh babulal gupta ne kaha ki sarkaar aachhatiyon ke kaam ko band karnaa chaahati he, jisase lagbhag puure rajasthan main 25 lakh se zyada log jude hue hai
 Because of buying crops directly from farmers, farmers are not coming to the market and officers are doing too much with the farmers
 thekedaaron ke saath milakar afasar mandi ke bajaay baahar hi baahar kisaanon se fasal kharid rahe hai, jahaan par baari bhrashtachar kiya ja rahaa he
 At least if the farmers bring crops to the market and the government will buy there, it will benefit both the traders and the farmers
 lekin mandi ke baahar samarthan mulya par anaaj kharidne or bechney kaa bhrashtachar kaa khel chal rahaa he
 For example, the government is buying moong crop at a support price of Rs 52 per kg and is selling it in the market at Rs 44 per kg
 aise main agar kisaan se vyapaaree 47 rupee prati kilo ke hisaab se mung kii fasal kharidta he to vah kahaan bechega
 In this way, the entire business of grain traders is ending
 rajasthan ke mandiyon main vyapaariyon ne shanivaar se kaam band kar diya he or sarkaar ko chetavanee di he ki agar mandi kii vyavastha nahin sudhari gai to aage aane vaale chunaav main vyapaaree bijepi ke khilaaf jaaenge

 Traders have demanded that traders doing business above 5 crore in GST should also be exempted from the tax filing limit within 3 months as the profit in the grain business is low and the turnover is high

 nai dillihsahitya academy ke rabindra bhawan sabhaagaar main kitabgar prakaashan se prakashit kamalakant treepathi ke aitihaasik-saanskrithik upanyaas 'sarayu se ganga' par murali manohar prasad singh kii adhyakshata main ek paricharchaa kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 Prof
 in the discussion
 nityanand tiwari mukhya atithi ke rup main upasthit rahe tathaa prasiddh kathakaar sanjeev ne vishay-pravartan kiya
 Karan Singh Chauhan, Asghar Wajahat, Kailash Narayan Tiwari, Bali Singh, Sanjeev Kumar, Rakesh Tiwari and Amit Dharm Singh participated as speakers in the discussion
 abhishek shukla ne paricharchaa kaa kushal sanchaalan kiya
 Narrating the theme, the narrator Sanjeev described the Ganga as a great and important novel written on the wide spectrum of history and social life from Saryu
 panipat, plasi, baxur, mughal samrajya kaa hraas, east india company ke varchasv main satat vistaar or nepal ke ekikaran kii prakriya kii prishthbhumi main unhone malgujari, thekedaari, talukedaari, kisaani or kheti ko upanyaas ke kendra main bataaya
 Underlining the beauty of the novel's indigenous language, he said that the entire novel is fragrant with Awadhi's touch
 duusare vaktaa amit dharm singh ne upanyaas ko itihaas, samaaj or jivan ke teen bhinn sandarbhon main baantkar dekha
 With the expansion of the company's dominance in the second half of the eighteenth century, she described the suffering of peasantry, the exploitation of rents and the irony of female life as relevant to the present scenario
 jivan paksh par baat karte hue unhone dharm kaa atikaraman karte hue maanav man kii satta or man ke milane se hi sarthak hindu-muslim ekta ko upanyaas main saakaar hote dekha
 Rakesh Tiwari, the third speaker journalist and writer, while referring to the episode of Mahamrityunjaya chanting as a religious fanatic in the novel, saw the writer standing against such hypocrites
 unhone atharahavin sadi ke saamaajik-raajnneetik sankraman tathaa lekhipati, jameel or rajjak jaise paatro ke madhyam se saajha-saanskrithik vikaas ke mahatv ko lakshith kiya
 Rakesh from Saryu described Ganga as basically a novel of the rural peasant and the working class
 kavi or aalochak bali singh ne upanyaas ke vistrut falak par tatkaaleen gaanv, kisaan, khet, fasal, jangal, nadi aadi ke bhugolic or prakritik paridrishy ko murtiman hote hue dekha
 In this context, he found Google incompetent in the face of author's sharp and authentic vision
 unhone kaha, upanyaas ek naatakeey style main likhaa gaya he jisamen itihaas naamak paatr sutaradhar kii bhoomika nibhaataa he
 The farmer has nothing to do with the treaty between the Nawabs and the company, but he becomes the biggest victim of exploitation on its basis
 unka daawa tha ki aaj ke bhoomandaleekaran ke daur main aisi hi sandhi sarkaar or poonjipati ke bich hoti he jiskaa khamiyaja kisaan janata ko berajgari, bhukhmaree or aatmahatya ke rup main bhugatna padataa he
 The main character of the novel appears to be struggling to get out of the clutches of the authorship collusion
 upanyaas main loktantric ekikaran kii chetana or raashtra rajya kaa sandesh antarnihit he jo dharmik, saanskrithik mithkon tak simit tha, kintu jiskaa koi bhautik astitv nahin tha
 The next speaker was Sanjeev Kumar, editor of Criticism magazine
 unhone upanyaas katha ke do ujwal pakshon- dharmanirpekshata evam janapakshdharata- kaa notice liya
 Characters like Lekhipathi, Jameel and Razzaq unite by encroaching on religion and successfully fight against the terrible, chaotic and exploitative situation that arose in the society with the dependence of the Nawab over the company
 agle vaktaa dilli vishvavidhyalay ke praadhyaapak or lekhak kailash narayan tiwari the
 He raised the issue of authorial autonomy and independence, saying that Kamalakant in this novel has drawn the mindset and subtle senses of his feelings and subtle sensibilities according to the circumstances of characters like Lekhipathi, Jamil, Razzaq, Savitri, and in the scope of the larger pane of history
 Like the family, village, home have presented a human form of mutual relations, reading it in Premchand's cow Manthi misses two parallel stories
 upanyaas main hindu-muslim sambandh ko dharm se itar vishuddh maanviya dharaatal par dikhaaya gaya he jo sookshm samvednaa se otprot he
 Karan Singh Chauhan said that any work is done in front of us for dialogue and this novel presents many dialogues in front of us
 samprati fishan ke tahat prachlit asmitaaon se nirpeksh yah upanyaas sahaj, maanviya hindustani bhaawanaaon kaa ek athmiya aainaa he jisamen samaaj kii jamini hakeekat pratibimbit hoti he
 The healthy and equitable system of independent rural unit in the country was going on for thousands of years
 angrejo ne use ek jatke main tod diya or usee ke saath samaaj, samskruti, or utpaadan ke utkrisht upadan dhwast kar die
 The novel has touched the aspect of feminine senses with unmatched subtlety and originality
 ant main unhone nishkarsh diya ki aise uttam koti ke upanyaas bahut kam or bahut samay baad aate hai
 Renowned playwright-narrator Asghar Wajahat told that the novel tells the story of the transfer of the feudal system of Awadh Pradesh to the Upanishadic system, wandering past, present and future
 upanyaas main hamen tatkaaleen samaaj main dharm us arth se bhinn arth main dikhaai padataa he jo aaj ke samaaj main haaavee hota ja rahaa he
 Chief Guest Prof
 nityanand tiwari ne kaha ki upanyaas itihaas kii dhara ko sahi dhang se ubharta he
 Does not frustrate his incoherence and the edge of the Crisis
 tatkaaleen samaaj main jo dar vyaapt he, upanyaas kaa har paatr uski giraft main he
 Continuing to fight that fear and the inhumanity behind it seems to be very relevant to today's scenario
 upanyaas hindu-muslim saajha samaaj kaa vah rup pesh karata he jo jaaysi ke padmavat main miltaa he
 In his presidential statement Murali Manohar Prasad Singh described the novel as opening the heart of the crisis arising out of the process of history
 jisamen vyapaaree banakar aae angrej rajasatta par kabiz hote hai
 Quoting historian Raychaudhuri, he said that nowhere in this novel, as in nineteenth-century novels, Muslim male and female characters are depicted as symbols of evil of human character
 yah kriti dharm kaa atikaraman karti hui munashya ke ujwal paksh ko ujagar karne ke kaaran is shatabdi kii mahatvapurn aupnyasik kriti ke rup main jaani jaaegi
