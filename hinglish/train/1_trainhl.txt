 The controversial decision by the Punjab government to amend the existing law to bring a provision for life imprisonment for insulting religious texts — particularly the Guru Granth Sahib, the Bhagavad Gita, the Quran and the Bible — has come under severe criticism
 21 agast ko mukhyamantri amarinder singh kii cabinet se manjuuri milane ke baad punjab vidhansabha ne 28 agast ko bhartiya dand vidhaan (ipisi) or dand prakriya samhita (siarpisi) main section 295 ee ko shaamil karne kii manjuuri de di
 This law replaces the 2016 law which only provided similar penalties for insulting Sikhism texts
 us vidheyak ko purv kii akali dal-bhaajapa sarkaar ne pesh kiya tha par use pichley saal april main centre ne khaarij kar diya tha
 The Center said that "all religions should be equally respected
" ''maujuuda sanshodhan kii aalochana "behad sakht'', "khatarnaak'' or "alpsankhyak dharmon ke liye ahitkar'' bataakar kii ja rahi he
 This amendment has been introduced in view of the huge anger among Sikhs due to more than 200 incidents of "insult" to Guru Granth Sahib
 in ghatnaon kii shuruyaat faridakot jile main bargadi gaanv se hui thi, jahaan 12 aktubar, 2015 ko dharm granth ke kuch fate hue panne paae gaye the
 Angry Sikhs took to the streets to protest against the incident
 punjab kii kul aabaadi main sikh kareeb 60 pratishat hai or ve guru granth sahib kaa sammaan jivit guru ke rup main karte hai
 Initially his protest was peaceful, but on October 14, he became violent after two protesters were killed in police firing in Behbal Kalan village of Faridkot district
 tatkaaleen mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ko tab dijipi ko hataanaa padaa tha or bargadi kii jaanch sibiai ko saunpny padi thi
 There is a lot of evidence that the ISI of Pakistan and the extremist elements living abroad were behind the fury of the Sikhs in the incidents of Burgundy and other incidents of insult to the scripture
 virodh pradarshnon or guru granth sahib ke fate pannon ko soshal media par dikhaae jane se punjab or videshon main bahut se sikh yuvaaon main dharmik kattarta badi he
 If the amendment approved on August 28 is also approved by the Center, then the state police will get the utmost right to arrest and punish the accused
 is sanshodhan ke anusaar, "jo koi bhi shri guru granth sahib, shrimadbhagavad gita, pavitra quran or pavitra bible ko logon kii dharmik bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne ke iraade se nuksaan pahunchaata he, use umrakaid kii sajaa honi chahie
 "its premise is that insulting the scriptures hurts the sentiments of the people of a particular community and also hurts law and order
" lekin varisht kanoon visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki punjab kaa yah vidheyak shaayad hi manjuur ho paae or uskaa bhi hashr 2016 ke vidheyak kii tarah ho saktaa he

 Before the Lok Sabha elections, Congress had dreamed of defeating BJP in the assembly elections of three states, at the same time, BSP President Mayawati has given a big blow to Rahul Gandhi
 chhattisgarhmen congress se baghawat kar alag party banane valijit jogike saath basapa ne haath mila liya he
 At the same time, Madhya Pradesh has released its list of candidates
 basapa ke tevar se saaf he ki congress ke saath gathbandhan kii sari ummiden khatm ho gai hai
 With the BSP not coming to the Congress, the BJP is once again looking to retain power
 vahiin, teen rajyon ke chunaav ke saath-saath 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress kaa banataa raajnneetik sameekaran ab bigadataa dikh rahaa he
 Assembly elections are due in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in october-november this year
 in teenon rajyon main bijepi kii sarkarein hai
 MP and BJP have been in power in Chhattisgarh for 15 years
 in donon rajyon congress netaa basapa ke saath gathbandhan kii koshishen kar rahe the, lekin mayawati ne unke mansoobon par pani pher diya he
 The BJP has been in power in Chhattisgarh for three times under the leadership of Raman Singh
 lekin congress or bijepi ke bich mahaj ek fisadi kaa antar he
 While the BSP got 4 in the last election
 5 fisadi vot mili the
 In the 2013 elections, BJP won 49 seats out of the 90 assembly seats in the state
 jabaki congress ko 39 or basapa ko ek seat mili thi
 The political picture of the state was likely to change if the bsp-congress came together and entered the electoral battle
 2013 main basapa or congress ek saath milakar utarate to nattejey alag hote
 The BJP lost 11 seats and got 38 seats
 jabaki congress-basapa gathbandhan 51 siton ke saath satta par kabiz ho jaataa
 This was the reason that the state president of the Congress was constantly talking about contesting elections with the BSP, but the betting has come on the hands of Ajit Jogi, who rebelled against the Congress and formed a separate party
 mayawati or jogi ke bich hue gathbandhan main 35 siten basapa ke khate main ai hai or 55 siton par jogi janata congress ko mili he
 While Jogi has a tribal vote, the BSP has a good hold over Dalit voters
 congress netaa bhi maanate hai ki rajya main do darjan siten aisi hai jahaan basapa ke chalate nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 In 2013, the BSP fielded candidates in 227 out of 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh
 basapa yahaan 6
 It managed to win four seats with 42 per cent of the vote
 rajya 75 se 80 siton par basapa pratyaashiyon ne 10 hajaar se zyada vot hasil kiye the
 While 8 between BJP and Congress
 4 fisadi vot share kaa antar tha
 BJP had 165 seats and Congress 58 seats
 chitrakoot vidhansabha seat par upachunaav main basapa ke na ladane kaa phayda congress ko mila tha
 In view of this, the Congress was trying to contest elections with parties like BSP and Gondwana Ganatantra Party
 thi
 But on Thursday, Mayawati released a list of her candidates, putting a full stop to the speculation of an alliance with the Congress
 madhya pradesh main basapa kaa aadhaar upi se sate ilaakon main acha khaasaa he
 The BSP has a strong hold in the regions of Chambal, Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand
 congress ke saath basapa kaa na utarana shivaraj ke liye achche sanket maane ja rahe hai
 The bsp's lack of association with the Congress is considered a blow to Rahul Gandhi's opposition unity
 iske chalate congress ko jahaan madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 Apart from this, it is difficult to say that the BSP remained with the Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 basapa 2019 main bhi isi tarah se alag hokar ladati he to congress ko kai rajyon main dalit maton kaa nuksaan jhelana pad saktaa he
 After the BJP and Congress, the BSP is the only party with a national base
 basapa aisa hi rukh uttar pradesh main bhi dikhaa sakati he
 Mayawati recently said that she will get respectable seats only then she will be a part of the grand alliance or else she will contest alone
 aisa hone par congress kii vipaksh ko ekajute karne kii koshish kamjor pad sakati he

 While the prices of petrol and diesel are skyrocketing, in the meantime, one of the BJP ruled states of Chhattisgarh has received disappointing news
 chhattisgarh sarkaar ne petrol or dijal kii keemten kam karne ko lekar waite tex ghataane se inkaar kar diya he
 He has also given many arguments behind this
 sarkaar kii daleel he ki duusare rajyon kii tulana main chhattisgarh main waite tex kaaphi kam he jiske chalate usamen katautee karne kii koi gunjaaish nahin he
 State Commerce Minister Amar Aggarwal said that first, other states should reduce their VAT tax and bring it at par with Chhattisgarh, then they will think about reducing VAT
 rajya main aviationpetrolpar 4 fisadi waite tex he jabaki dijal or petrol par 25 fisadi
 Apart from this, there is a cess tax of 2 percent on petrol and 1 percent on diesel
 itnaa hi nahin rajya main dijal or petrol laane vaale tankeron par ek fisadi entry tex bhi he
 For now, the Raman Singh government has come under attack from opponents for refusing to reduce VAT tax
 chhattisgarh kii bijepi sarkaar ne centre sarkaar ke us farmaan ko ansuna kar diya he, jisame centre ne bijepi shasit rajyon se waite tex ghataane ko lekar guhaar lagaai gai thi
 Chhattisgarh is also one of the BJP ruled states but the Raman Singh government has shown no interest in reducing VAT tax
 rajya main baari bharkam waite tex or ses tex ke chalate sarkari tijori main rojaanaa dhan kii barish hoti he
 Therefore, the government has given a new argument for reducing VAT tax
 duusari ore congress ne sarkaar ko aade haath lete hue kaha ki unki praathamikta aam janata nahin balki wo log he jo aasmaan main udate hai
 The Congress leader lashed out at the BJP government and said that they are fiercely opposed to the general public, poor and middle family
 use to sirf chintaa un ek fisadi se bhi kam logon kii he jo hawaii safar karte hai
 a liter of petrol in the state costs more than Rs 70, while diesel is close to Rs 61 per liter
 agar waite tex main jaraa si kami kii jaae to petrol or dijal kii keemat 10 se 20 rupee prati litre tak kam ho sakati he
 On the other hand, the government is so kind to the companies that fly in the state that aviation companies have to pay only 4% VAT tax
 saath hi unhen ses or entry tex main bhi chhot he
 Explain that after the Gujarat State Government Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had decided to cut the price of petrol and diesel in the state by 4% VAT
 iske baad maharashtra or himachal pradesh sarkaar ne bhi petrol or dijal par waite gata diya tha

 Some organizations have even raised their voice against its release
 ayushmaan ne kaha, ''film ke diarector anubhav sinha ne ek bayaan jari kiya tha
 In which it was written that we have not shown negative image of any community, especially of Brahmin community
 jab log film dekhenge to unhen pataa chalegaa ki film main jo samarthak hai ve brahman samudaay se hai or isliye hamane kisi kii bhi aalochana nahin kii he
 '' View this post on Instagram # Article15 in theaters on 28th June 2019 When performing in play, we used to deal with a lot of social problems
 iske alaava film kii shooting ke dauraan maine is samasya se judi kuch kitaaben bhi padhi hai isliye main desh main maujuud jatvaad ko jaanata hum
 It is very hot in rural areas
 shahari kshetron main aap intercast marij dekh sakate hai jabaki gaanvon main aisa nahin hota
 Talking about the most important topic of the film, Ayushmann said that through the film, he has tried to tell people that casteism still exists in the country and we have to solve this problem

 Before giving this instruction, the court said that the law is equal for all and it should reach everyone
 ucch nyaayalay ne sibiai ko yah bhi nirdesh diya ki vah agle hafte tak pragati report saunpe
 This direction was given by a bench of Justice Ranjana Desai and Justice RG Ketkar while hearing a number of petitions related to the scam
 in yachikaaon main ek yachika adarsh socity kii bhi he jisane imaarat ko dhwast karne ke aadesh ko chunauti di he
 There is also a petition from social activist Simpreet Singh who has demanded that the court supervise the investigation

 Justice Ranjana Desai said, "the CBI should investigate the role of every person concerned, no matter who he is and hold any position
" kanoon sabhi ke liye baraabar he or uski pahunch sab logon tak honi chahie
 The CBI should also investigate these allegations before filing a progress report next week
 kendriya gramin vikaas mantri deshmukh or kendriya bijli mantri scindia us vakt maharashtra ke mukhyamantri the jab kolaba main bahumanjila adarsh socity ke nirmaan se sambandhit file par karrwai kii gai thi
 Additional Solicitor General Darius Khambata, appearing for the CBI, told the court that the agency had already taken all documents related to Deshmukh and Shinde from Simpreet Singh
 khambata ne kaha, ham iskaa pataa laga rahe hai
 The agency is investigating on a war footing
 adaalat ko agle buudhvaar ko pragati report saunpi jaaegi
 The Adarsh society allegedly violated the Coastal Regulation Zone norms, along with other procedures
 purv patrkaar kethan tirodkar ne buudhvaar ko ek halafanama daayar kar aarope lagaaya ki maharashtra ke upmukhyamantri ajit pavaar bhi adarsh socity ghotaale main shaamil hai
 Tirodkar has also filed a petition

 vahi pataa adarsh socity ke do sadasyon jayshri bhonsle or nivritti ganpati bhonsle ne bhi shapathpatr main diya he
 The court also asked the CBI to investigate this aspect

 hayaat hotel kii morchebandi ne vipaksh ko di takatmaharashtra kii satta kii res main daavedaari hui pukhtalokatantr main takat kii pariksha sadan main hoti he
 It is rarely that political parties have to demonstrate their power in a five-star hotel
 lekin somvaar ko mumbai ke hotel grand hayaat main ek tarah kii mini essembly sajaai gai
 Shiv sena-congress and NCP summoned 162 mlas at Hotel Hyatt
 yahaan unka photo seshan karaayaa gaya phir unhen eemaandaaree or nishtha kii shapath dilaai gai
 With this, these three parties once again announced that they have again come to the front foot in the politics of Maharashtra
 kanoonee adchanon ko agar ek taraf rakh diya jaae to mangalvaar ko supreme court se aane vaale faisle se pehle pavaar-uddhav or khadge ne bahut hoshiyaari ke saath danke kii chot par ye munaadi karvaa di he ki bijepi ke paas sankhyabal nahin he or wo loktantr kaa makhul uda rahi he
 In fact, Maha Vikas Aghadi, an alliance of Shiv sena-congress and NCP, has taken the lead on three fronts in the ongoing power race for Maharashtra with this mega event
 nyaayik birdari main sandeshmaharashtra ke maamle main mangalvaar ko supreme court main ahm sunwaayee he
 In an unprecedented development, Devendra Fadnavis was sworn in as CM on Saturday in Maharashtra
 ensipi netaa ajit pavaar ne dipti siem pad kii shapath lee thi
 Maharashtra's opposition has challenged this decision in the Supreme Court
 somvaar ko donon pakshon ne sarvocch nyaayalay ke saamne apni daleelein rakhin
 The Supreme Court is scheduled to give its verdict in this case on Tuesday
 is faisle se pehle apane paksh main lagbhag 162 vidhayakon ko jutakar maha vikaas aghadi ne nyaayik birdari main sandesh de diya he ki kanoonee pechidigiyaan bhale hi kuch bhi hon, insaaf kaa takaza ye kahata he ki maharashtra kii satta ke asli daavedaar ve hi hai
 Read: Pawar got power - Uddhav got energy, 162 mlas in front, both such leaders roared, the new political picture of Maharashtra, this unity of Shiv sena-ncp and Congress has political significance
 teenon dalon ne ab ye khulkar kah diya he ki ve maharashtra main sarkaar banane ke liye ek saath aa chuke hai
 Earlier, there was a round of meetings and consultations between these three parties
 lekin fadanvis kii tajposhi ne do kaam kiya he
 The first thing is that all three parties have agreed to the agreement after Maharashtra's power falls
 iske liye ve kuch had tak apane hiton kii qurbaani dene ko bhi taiyaar hai
 The second thing is that this development has forced these three parties to control their Iago as well
 pehle shivasena ke saath gathbandhan ko jhijak rahi congress ab iske liye puri tarah se taiyaar he
 At the same time, this incident had become a question of survival for NCP
 lekin somvaar ko hayaat hotel main ekajute hokar in teenon partiyaan na sirf apana ghar sametane main kaamyaab rahi hai, balki ye massej de diya he ki unke vidhayak tuutane vaale nahin hai
 The oath taken by the legislators for this also has moral pressure
 agar maharashtra main ye prayog kaamyaab rahata he to ye siyaasi dosti aage bhi ja sakati he
 However such a prediction would be hasty
 bataa den ki somvaar ko hi pavaar ne kaha ki ye saath 5 saalon kaa nahin balki 50 saalon kaa he
 Uddhav Thackeray also reiterated the same things
 The moral strength gained from the blasts was witnessed by millions of people on Monday at the Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai
 logon ne saaf-saaf dekha ki teen dal ke netaa sarkaar banane kii manshaa ko lekar ek saath aae hai or inke paas paryaapt bahumat bhi he
 All the three parties claimed that 162 mlas are present in this power show
 aam logon ke bich iskaa ye sandesh gaya ki loktantr ke kaayade-kanoonon ke mutabik sarkaar banane kaa haq inhen kaa he, kyonki inke paas sankhyabal he
 The current government of Maharashtra seems to be hanging in the balance, because in the majority calculus, BJP does not seem to reach anywhere near the 145 figure needed to form a government from anywhere
 darasal is event ke jariye shivasena-congress or ensipi janamat ko apni ore jhukaane main kaamyaab hote dikh rahe hai

 The same thing happened in Delhi
 jab bijepi ko bulaayaa gaya tha, or baad main aap ko bulaayaa gaya tha or unhone sarkaar banaai thi
 His Majesty should have adopted this process
 paanch rajyon main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main se teen rajyon main vipaksh ke mahagathbandhan ke saamne post hone ke baavjood bijepi ekala chalo kii ranneeti par bhi kaam kar rahi he
 Party President Amit Shah indicated this effect in a meeting with mps from Maharashtra on Thursday
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki amit shah ne maharashtra main apane sabhi saansadon se rajya main akele loksabhaa chunaav ladane kii taiyaari karne ko kaha he
 Sources say that Amit Shah, in a meeting with the mps of the state, clearly stated why we should go to such an alliance, which in turn would harm us

 After defeats in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, BJP reached the seat sharing formula for the Lok Sabha in Bihar
 yahaan vah jediu ke baraabar 17 siton par lard rahi he
 For this, the BJP had to give up five seats won in 2014, so that its allies could also join the alliance
 haalanki, isse lok janashakti party to gathbandhan main khushi se shaamil ho gai, lekin upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party endie se baahar nikal gai thi
 It is believed that after this, Shiv Sena also hoped that it would gain some more seats by putting pressure on BJP in the alliance
 shivasena pichley kaaphi samay se centre sarkaar or bijepi ke sheersh netritv ko sawaalon ke ghere main leti rahi he
 Assembly elections are also to be held six months after the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra
 in chizon ke baavjood bijepi netaaon ko lagata he ki loksabhaa chunaavon main maharashtra main akele rahanaa uske liye phydemand hoga
 It is believed that BJP leaders are angry with the statements of Shiv Sena leaders
 bijepike netaaon kaa maananaa he ki shivasena gathbandhan main rahete hue lagaataar bayaanbaji se apni seemaa laangh rahi he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray also used the Congress slogan - Chowkidar Chor Hai, against Prime Minister Narendra Modi several times in his rally
 mana ja rahaa he ki shivasena apni naaraazgi jataakar vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi se molbhav karne ke liye dabaav bana rahi thi
 Kishivasena is said to want an equal share in the 288-seat assembly
 lekin jab bijepi ke paas 123 vidhayak hai to uskaa shivasena ko aadhi yani 144 siten dena sambhav nahin lag rahaa he
 After seeing the seat sharing in Bihar, the Shiv Sena hoped that the BJP would take a soft approach to the alliance in Maharashtra as well
 lekin bijepi kaa rukh dekhakar lagata he ki yaa to maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena main gathbandhan nahin hoga yaa hoga bhi to iske liye kaaphi jaddojahad dekhne ko milegi

 Following the Breguit and refugee crisis, many countries in the European Union are witnessing the emergence of a new kind of nationalism, which has shaken the foundations of the most progressive union of nations in recent history
 yah asal main itihaas ke gaal par ek tamaacha he
 West Asia is constantly surrounded by flames
 yah majahabi ugravad or barbar ladaaiyon se jaar-jaar he jinka koi ant dikhaai nahin detaa
 It remains a bloody playground of two superpowers
 udhar, afgaan jang jari he jahaan america maujuudagi kaa 17waan saal puraa ho rahaa he
 Here he is fighting a battle which neither he can win nor defeat
 udhar, atomi asthirataa phir aa khadi hui he
 Leaders are behaving as if boys play with toys
 par ye khatarnaak khilone hai
 The US president has even claimed that his atomic button is much larger than Kim Jong's button

 i believe that the great contradiction has also thrown up five contradictions which we will have to overcome in the coming years
 ham unase kaise nibatate hai, isi se 21veen sadi kii ibaarat likhi jaaegi
 The first most dangerous paradox is the return of nationalism to a vastly interconnected globalized world
 sangrakshanvaadi takatein sir uthaa rahi hai
 One country after another, there are obstacles in the way of trade, movement of people, even ideas
 hamen ek karne vaali takaton ke banisbat alag karne vaali takatein zyada majboot ho rahi hai
 a wonderful thinker of our times, Yuval Noa Harari, gave us his views on 21st century nationalism
 doosraa virodhabhas loktantr par mandaraate khatre hai
 Democracy is the beautiful cradle of freedom
 magar in aazaadiyon ko kattartavaad, bahusankhyakwaad or vyapak ashishnutaa ke jariye kamjor kiya ja rahaa he
 This is the emergence of conservative and a variety of lumpen democracies
 khud hamaare apane mulk main kya ho rahaa he! bina dekhe hi filmon par paabandiyaan lagaai ja rahi he
 People are being killed for keeping the wrong type of meat at home or for taking animals
 rashtriya dharoharon ko nest-naabud karne kii garaj se itihaas dobaaraa likhaa ja rahaa he
 The names of the roads are being changed because they glorify evil kingdoms and statues are being dropped because they are vabastas with another ideology
 tamaam kism ke dhade media ko lagaataar hinsa kii dhamkiyaan de rahe hai
 We have become a "republic of sighs" and just wait when who will embarrass and humiliate us and make it a point of contention to grab people's attention
 khamoshi or niskriyata se kattarta ko or takat milti he
 Noisy debate has been replaced by noise and consternation even in Parliament
 aap aage ke pannon par padhenge ki is sabake bare main sonia gandhi ne kya kaha
 The judges are openly quarreling with each other in the highest court of justice, the Supreme Court
 siyasatdan afasarshahon or kanoon lagu karne vaale afasaron ke saath marpet or un par hamale kar rahe hai
 And it seems that the bureaucracy does not exist for the service of the people, but for the people
 jab yah sab ho rahaa ho to aap jaan jate hai ki loktantr khatre main he
 And if i say that democracy is in danger, then know that the nation is in danger
 kyonki hindustan ko bataur loktantr hi chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Third Paradox Maxim
 leader kaa abhyuday he
 No one will feel that the society will be more interconnected under the umbrella of a strong leader and we will all be able to live a more peaceful life
 ho ulataa rahaa he
 The society is far more wired than the earlier rivalries and conscience
 america ko hi len
 Today it is a country which is divided on the basis of ideologies and there is no middle ground
 nateeja har vakt khinchataan or lagaataar takaraav he
 Hillary Clinton has to see it all from her perspective
 unase behatar shaks doosraa nahin ho saktaa tha kyonki unhone pichley chaar dashakon se america siyasat ko kareeb se or nijee taur par dekha or usamen hissaa liya he
 Hindustan too has become a more divided society
 isane pahchaan kii siyasat kaa ubhaar dekha he, vah jati kii pahchaan ho, dharm kii yaa kshetra kii
 Hindustan has been an advocacy of plurality and its roots are being dug
 alpsankhyak dar or khatra mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Now Hindus are also being asked what kind of Hindus they are
 jald hi babari masjid kaa faisla aayega, tab hindustan kii loktantric saakh kii agnipariksha hogi
 The fourth paradox is the huge gulf in spite of increasing prosperity
 vaishvikaran or navachaar ke dam par ai aarthik vruddhi kii badaulat jahaan desh zyada samrudh, khushhaal hue hai, vahiin amir zyada amir or garib zyada garib
 Non-parity has increased worldwide and Hindustan is among the countries where it is the highest
 sabase upar ke 1 fisadi log 58 fisadi sampada ke maalik hai
 70 per cent of the new assets that are being built, they are used
 chaitarafa failaa kheti-kisaani kaa sankat or vyapak berogari aisa time bam he jo tik -tik kar rahaa he
 The isolated people will be filled with anger upon seeing that the rich are safe even after robbing the banks
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne ise bakhubi samaj liya he
 Many of his schemes have targeted this paradox
 sampada kaa nirmaan karne waalon ko sajaa die bagaiyr vruddhi ke saath insaaf or barabari laana badi chunauti he
 Still, the question that is often repeated in India - "are we moving towards demographic disaster or are we going to reap the demographic benefits?" - Still in the limelight
 iske bare main or bainkon ke bare main hamen is conklev main bhi bahut kuch sunne ko mila
 The fifth and final paradox is the emergence of global digital giants: These are companies with a lot of power but no accountability
 unhone hamaari jindagi ko behatar banaaya he par isaki keemat bhi vasuuli he
 Privacy is a thing of the past
 ve hamaare bare main sab kuch jaanate hai or uskaa manamaane tareeke se istemaal karne ke liye aaazaad hai
 Their sultanates have no border
 ve soochnaaon, sanvaadon or manoranjan kii awajahi ke nae darban hai
 The status of four big companies — Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple — is equivalent to about $ 3 trillion
 soshal media bhi dodhari talwaar he
 It can also be used for good and for evil
 yah harek ko apni raay jaahir karne kii aazaadee detaa he par vah aazaadee tab khatre main pad jaati he jab sanghathan apane se nittefaki rakhane vaale logon ko badnaam karne ke liye trolls kii fouj utaar dete hai
 But it also allows for more social activism
 isi kii badaulat # me tu or # times ap sareekhe andolan un logon kaa pardaafash kar sake jo apni asal khoonkhaar shakhsiyat ko chhipaane ke liye sharafat kaa labaadaa odhe rahete hai
 But the truth is constantly in the box
 phek news aisa virus he jo puure digital echosystem main fail gaya he
 It will be a big challenge to implement rules and regulations on these technology giants
 main maanata hum, ye virodhabhas hi ve ahm mudde honge jo 21veen sadi par chhaae rahenge
 Conversation on similar issues was a squeeze of our conclave of ideas

 In such a situation, it will be very interesting to see what new form of dialogue between the Patidar leader and the government takes

 But this is true
 aap chahen to apni kuch aadaton main sudhaar laakar apana badha hua pet kam kar sakate hai
 1
 sidhe khadey rahakajgar aapako apana badha hua pet ajeeb najar aane laga he to aaj se hi sidhe khadey hone kii aadat daal lijie
 This is the perfect posture to reduce belly fat

 If you do this even five to six times a day, then within few days you will start seeing results
 3
 The right way to sleep The method of sleeping is helpful in removing many of our troubles
 saamaanya rup se ek shaks ko saat se aath ghante kii neend jarur leni chahie
 In today's time, due to very busy routine, most people are not able to get enough sleep and this is also a major reason for obesity
 4
 Use water instead of drinking soda
 If you like drinking soda and other soft drinks, then this can be the main reason for your obesity
 in peya-padaarthon main paryaapt maatra main calories hoti he jisase vajan badhanaa tay he
 So, if you feel thirsty then drink soft water instead of soft drink
 5
 Avoiding Chewing Gum Chewing chewing gum is a habit of many people
 aapako shaayad yakeen na ho lekin chuing gam chabane se bhi motopa badhata he
 The midhas present in it increase the calories, which is responsible for belly fat

 The ongoing tussle within the BJP ahead of the 2014 general elections is still coming to the fore after President Rajnath Singh's pressing
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar aa rahi he ki adwani ab narendra modi kii jagah nitin gadakari ko prachaar samiti kii kaman saunpane ke haq main the, lekin nitin gadakari ne yah pad sanbhaalane se inkaar kar diya
 Gadkari said that the party has already fixed Modi's name for this
 raajnneetik halkon main is puure maamle ko adwani or modi ke bich badhati duriyon ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 It is being told that Advani met Gadkari several times on this issue
 unhone gadakari ko bataaya ki unhen adhyaksh pad se hataane ke liye party ke hi ek netaa ne gumraah kiya tha
 The comments gauratlab he ki gadakari kii companiyon par chaape ke baad unhen adhyaksh pad se hataane main adwani ne ek badi bhoomika nibhaai thi, haalanki sutron ke mutabik, gadakari ko manaane main adwani kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 Gadkari made it clear that when Modi's name has already been decided for this post, it would not be right to pursue his name
 darasal, modi or adwani ke bich badi hoti khai kii yah iklauti misaal nahin he
 Last week, Advani's statement also confirmed the growing distance in which he had said that Shivraj was better than Modi
 naubat yah aa gai thi ki rajnath singh ko saamne aakar yaad dilaanaa padaa ki modi bade netaa hai
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan himself also accepted this
 gadakari ne kaha ki party ne pehle hi iske liye modi kaa naam tay kar diya he
 In political circles, this whole issue is being seen as a growing distance between Advani and Modi
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is mudde par adwani ne gadakari se kai baar mulaakaat kii
 He told Gadkari that he was misled by a party leader to remove him from the post of president
 tippaniyan Significantly, Advani played a big role in removing him from the post of president after the raid on Gadkari's companies, although according to sources, Advani could not succeed in persuading Gadkari
 gadakari ne saaf kar diya ki jab pehle hi is pad ke liye modi kaa naam lagbhag tay ho chukaa he to unke naam ko aage badhanaa thik nahin hoga
 Actually, this is not the only example of a large gap between Modi and Advani
 beete hafte adwani ke us bayaan ne bhi badhati duriyon kii tasdik kar di thi, jisamen unhone ek tarah se shivaraj ko modi se behatar bataa diya tha
 It had come to the fore that Rajnath Singh had to come forward and remind Modi that Modi is a big leader
 khud shivaraj singh chouhan ne bhi yah baat maan lee

 The miscreants who carried out the robbery on Monday at Delhi's Rajendra Place metro station are still out of reach of police
 is lut ne ek baar phir dilli ke metron steshnon kii suraksha par sawalia nishaan laga diya he
 The hands of the police are still empty in this case
 suraksha par sawalsomvaar kii subah chaaron ore se suraksha bandobast ke baavjood do badmaash chaaku lekar dilli ke rajendra placemetro steshnamen daakhil hue
 The miscreant entered into the control room of the station fearlessly and robbed the collection of 12 lakhs of the Metro and escaped

 Both miscreants can be seen in the station's CCTV footage but not their faces

 19 minute baad subah 5 bajkar 34 minute par badmaash get number ek se nikalakar faraar ho gaye
 Some important questions are suspected by security agencies that the way the robbers executed the incident with ease, it seems that they were fully aware of the metro staff collection
 police jaanch main jo ahm sawaal uthe hai ki01
 According to him, the miscreants stabbed the metro staff, so why did no one hear his shouting? 02
 stesan main daakhile ke vakt dhardaar hathiyaar ko bag aadi kii suraksha jaanch main clearence kaise mil gai?03
 The sharp weapon used in the loot was not provided by any staff at the metro station
 ?police ke haath khalipadtaal main juty police ke liye faraar aaropee badmaashon kii talash badi chunauti he
 The investigation of the police is not being completed due to their faces not being clean
 na hi badmaashon kii shinaakht ho pai he or na hi unka koi suraag police ke haath lag paaya he
 Now only after the arrest of the miscreants, it will be clear how far the wires of the robbery conspiracy at the metro station have spread

 In the letter written to the new President, Khathindu Mahasabha has said in a letter to the new President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the name of Viceroy House built during the British era was changed to Rashtrapati Bhavan after independence in 1947, but the name of Mughal Gardens till now Has not changed
 rajendra prasad par ho garden kaa namahindu mahasabha ke mahasachiv munna prasad sharma ne kaha he ki haal hi main mughalsarai railway stesan kaa naam bhi badla gaya he
 According to Munna Sharma, Mughal Garden was always rare for common citizens, but the first President of India, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, made it available to the public
 aise main mughal garden kaa naam badalakar doctor rajendra prasad udyaan kar dena chahie
 Not to demand the protest, the Hindu Mahasabha has warned that if the name of the Mughal Garden is not changed after the name of Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, then he will protest outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan

 Goyal has warned the central government that if sealing action is not stopped permanently by bringing an ordinance or bill by February 10, Delhi will be closed again and traders will go on indefinite strike as well as hunger strike

 The manner in which traders have been harassed by sealing, FDI and GST, this is equivalent to piercing the veins of traders in the country's capital

 Referring to the loss due to the loss of crores due to the shutdown of the business, Vinay Narang, a businessman of automobiles and motor parts, told that there are 25 thousand traders in Kashmiri Gate, with which about one and a half lakh employees work and trade

 Many times, both of you have plans to meet or have dinner and cancel due to some reason

 How will they react? jab tak aapako uski pratikriya or mood kaa pataa chalegaa tab tak aap donon main esemes yuddh chhid chukaa hoga
 These written words further promote tu-tu main-i who end love in future
 ''ai em rhite, you aar rong' ke lekhak or clinical manochikitsak jevier amedor kaa kahana he ki 'esemes se jo baatcheet hoti he usase aapako aamane-saamne hone vaali baatcheet se teen guni kam jaankaree milti he

 Amador says that when both of you are talking through SMS, then only logical (logical) part of your brain is moving
 lekin jab aap aamane-saamne baat kar rahe hote hai to aap donon ek duje se bhavuk taur par jude hote hai

 bijepi, congress or dramuk sahit anya pramukh raajnneetik dalon ne loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan nirdhaarit samaysima ke bheetar jutayi gayi chande kii rakam kaa ab tak chunaav ayog ko byoraa nahin diya he

 ucchtam nyaayalay ke nirdeshaanusaar 30 may tak sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko chunavi bond se jutaye gayi chande kaa byoraa chunaav ayog ko dena tha
 However, the Congress said that its leader Motilal Vora wrote a letter to the State Bank of India (SBI) and the Election Commission (EC) on May 30 asking the bank to comply with the Supreme Court order and inform the Election Commission in a sealed envelope
 Was because the party does not even know who bought these bonds
 congress ne kaha ki usne bank se isi ko soochna dene ke liye kaha tha
 In May, before the expiry of this deadline, the Commission had written to all political parties to give details of the funds raised from electoral bonds
 ayog ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki pramukh raajnneetik dalon bhaajapa, congress or dramuk ne "kam se kam" abhi tak byora nahin diya he
 It is noteworthy that on April 12, the Supreme Court had directed political parties to submit the list of donors of donations received in the government's political donation scheme to the Commission by May 30 in a sealed envelope
 is yojana main daandaataaon kii pahchaan saarvajanik karne ke bare main ayog or sarkaar ke bich virodhabhas barkaraar he
 On one hand, the government is in favor of keeping the identity of donors secret, while on the other hand, the Commission has asked for transparency in electoral donations to make public the identity of donors
 is bare main adaalat ke samaksh ayog ne kaha tha ki uskaa najariya sirf raajnneetik chande kii paardarshita tak simit he, iskaa yojana kii khoobiyon or khaamiyon se koi sambandh nahin he
 Under this scheme, any Indian citizen or any political party established and operated in India can donate money by purchasing electoral bonds from the bank

 Under the scheme, 29 branches of State Bank of India were authorized to issue electoral bonds between November 1 and 10 last year

 The BJP is the Kuber for money and resources and the Prime Minister says that the opposition has money power! He said, our fight is with a Prime Minister who made false promises, showed the people a vegetable and even today he is insensitive

 pathankot hamale ko lekar centre sarkaar ko kaafii aalochana jhelni padi he
 Perhaps this may have been the reason that the "security audit" of the "important buildings" across the country on Friday in the North Block, the Ministry of Home Affairs, specifically discussed that a new strategy was needed about the media
 is baithak main ye bhi tay kiya gaya ki agar pathankot jaise hamale aage hue to koi "adhikrut vyakti" hi media ko jaankaree degaa wo bhi vahaan-jahaan karrwai ho rahi hogi
 The first media briefing was held in Delhi by the government in the Pathankot attack in which the Home Secretary informed the media
 usamen ek sawaal par unhone jawaab diya tha ki itane bade hamale main kuch jaane to jaati hi hai
 He was also severely criticized for this statement of the Home Secretary
 baharhaal centre sarkaar ne ab tay kiya he ki adhikrut afasaron ko media se kaise baatcheet kerani he uske bare main training bhi di jaaegi
 Pathankot has the highest number of Kirkri Prime Ministers office

 pathankot hamale main sarkaar kii ore se dilli main pehle media brifing hui thi jisamen grih sachiv ne media ko jaankaree di thi
 In that, he had answered a question that in such a big attack, some people even know

 Delhi Police has arrested the master of online fraud from his house i
e
 Jamtara in Jharkhand
 jamtada yani mobile banking thagi ke maamalon kaa wo thikaana, jo ab sirf hindustan hi nahin, balki hindustan se baahar bhi badnaam ho chukaa he
 Ram Kumar Mandal, popularly known as Hello Master, is so adept at cheating that he would first win his trust by placing a call from his mobile phone and then clearing his bank account
 is tarah se wo ab tak karodon ke vaare-nyaare kar chukaa he
 a person from Anand Vihar complained to the police in this regard
 usne bataaya tha ki beeti 13 may ko ek shaks ne peedit se phone par kaha ki wo rigerv bank se bol rahaa he
 And for verification of his account he needs some details
 iske baad baton hi baton main us shaks ne peedit se uske acount kii sari jaankaree le lee
 He was also asked for an OTP on the phone during the fraud
 peedit ke bank acount se mahaz das second main ek lakh 85 hajaar rupee uda liye gaye
 However, he immediately complained to the police and the matter reached the cyber cell
 police ne jab pataa lagaaya to unhen is baat kii jaankaree mili ki saare paise alag-alag i walet main chale gaye hai
 The police immediately spoke to the service provider and asked for 40 thousand back but they came to know that the remaining amount of electricity-water bills have been filled by different people
 police ne chaanbin kii, to bill bharne vaale kii pahchaan jodhpur ke ek thekedaar surendra ke taur par hai
 The police detained Surendra and then gradually the whole gang was revealed
 ye pataa chalaa ki surendra or uske aage ke kai log jamtada ke rahane vaale usee helo master yani ramkumar mandal ke liye kamishan par kaam karte hai
 The police arrested Surendra and some operatives, but arresting Mandal from Jharkhand was the biggest challenge
 kyonki wo naa sirf apane thikaane main mahafooj tha, balki sthaneey logon or gang ke badmaashon kii vajah se us tak pahunchnaa bhi police ke liye badi chunauti thi
 But the police finally succeeded
 vaise to jamtada ke is thag master kii talash main 25 rajyon kii police lagi thi
 But Ramkumar Mandal went up to the Delhi Police
 2011 main mandal kaa jamtada main ek chota sa ghar tha, lekin wo 2011 main mumbai pahunchaa or phir usne vahaan se atm or aanaline banking thagi main maharath hasil kar lee
 As soon as he saw, he started playing in crores
 wo ab rose hi logon ke acount hack karata or rupee nikaal letaa
 He cheated and distributed this skill among three hundred boys of his own village
 dekhte hi dekhte ek gaanv puure desh ke logon kii jeb kaatane laga
 Rather, it is now suspected that he is also related to the Naxalites
 ab usne jharkhand ke baahar dilli, rajasthan or goa jaise rajyon main bhi apana gang bana liya
 With the money of a Delhi man, shopping in Goa would have taken place, while Goan's money would have shopped in Rajasthan
 ram kumaar ke khilaaf desh ke 25 rajyon main cese darj hai
 But still the police could not reach Ramkumar till now
 kyonki jamtada ke uske gaanv main ramkumar ke kherkhwaah bahut hai
 In such a situation, now the Delhi Police reached Jamtara in a plain veneer
 usne local police se bhi sampark hi nahin kiya or to police ke log gaanv pahunchane se pehle alag-alag hisson main bant gaye, koi auto se to kai bas se gaanv pahunchaa taaki kisi ko shaq naa ho or phir sab gaanv main pahunchakar ek saath hue or sidhe ramkumar ke ghar pahunchakar use daboch liya
 a search found about five lakh cash inside his house, which was hidden in a bag of diapers
 ram kumaar ke gaanv waalon kii maane to ram kumaar ke ladakon ne amitabh bachchan ko bhi nahin baksha, or bank manager ban kar unase bhi 5 lakhthug liethe, haalanki dilli police kaa kahana he ki unhen isaki jaankaree nahin he
 So far, the police has been able to get information about only one account of Ram Kumar, in which a crore has come in a few days
 police kaa kahana he ki ram kumaar ke paas kul kitne account hai iskaa pataa kiya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, the police hope that after the arrest of this master, there will be some reduction in online fraud

" ’ merilabone cricket club (emsisi) ne haal main balle ke aakaar ko lekar simaaen tay kii hai lekin warner ne kaha ki badlaav kaa bada asar nahin hoga
 He said, 'we have to adjust to these changes
 gend ab bhi utani dur jaaegi, boundry lagengi, ham ek yaa do ran lete rahenge
 Maybe after taking the edge of the bat, the ball does not hit the boundary
 ’emsisi ne haal main ghoshnaa kii thi ki oktober se balle ke aakaar ko simit kiya jayega
 Now the bat depth will be just 67 mm, which is 18 mm more than Warner's current bat

" unhone kaha, ‘agar aap chook jaaoge or switch hit laga rahe honge to aapako pagabaadha out diya ja saktaa he lekin agar aap reverse sweep kar rahe honge to aisa nahin hoga
 You have to be alert
 ’ warner ne kaha, ‘mujhe pataa he ki agar main shaat kheloongaa (aswin ke khilaaf) to use kuch badlaav karnaa hoga
 He said, "he is a great bowler, he has got a lot of wickets at his home and i have to react to this

 The councilors had challenged the Election Commission notification saying that the way the State Election Commission has adopted reservation of seats for Scheduled Caste candidates is flawed
 unka aarope he ki is pranali se aisi sthiti utpann ho gai he ki jin ilaakon main anusuchit jati kii 40 pratishat aabaadi he use saamaanya ward ghoshit kar diya gaya he or jahaan anusuchit jati kii aabaadi 16 pratishat he use surakshit seat banaaya gaya he
 The councilors contend that while making reservation of seats, the Election Commission took into consideration their number in the assembly constituencies instead of keeping in mind the number of scheduled caste voters in the wards, which is not correct

 is bich ekapatrkaarane kaha he ki tanushri jo kah rahi hai usamen sachai he
 The journalist claims that she was also present during the incident 10 years ago
 tanushri-naanaa vivaad: aaropon par actor bole- kanoonee karrwai karuungapatrkaar kaa naam jainis sikeria he
 He has told the story in several tweets
 unhone likhaa, "ek dashak pehle hui ghatnaayen bhi kai baar aapke jehan main taaja rahati hai
 An incident that occurred during the shooting of the film Horn Ok Please is similar
 " jainis ne likhaa, "main us vakt vahaan thi naanaa patekar
 i was told that the shooting has been stopped because of the actress
 tanushri ko sanbhaalanaa mushkil ho gaya tha
 i could clearly see that Tanushree was very upset by anything
 "tanushri ne kabuuli cosmetic surgery karaane kii baat, mili thi aisi salaahakhri maukey par badal diya gaya plan?jainis ne likhaa ki vah saaf taur par dekh paa rahi thim ki naanaa patekar, koreographer ganesh acharya or ek shaks (jo unhen baad main pataa chalaa ki film kaa produsar he) vahaan khadey kisi bare main charchaa kar rahe the or kareeb 50 dancers set par khadey intjaar kar rahe the
 Official information was that Heroine is not cooperating
 kuch der baad shooting shuru kar di gai
 Tanushree on Metoo - wanted to enter the intimate scene, broke in anger, Karjannis wrote in her tweet - "tanushree resumed her job and after a few shots Nana joined her again
 lekinnanaake aate hi tanushri set se chali gayi
 Shooting was again halted
 unhone khud ko venity vine main band kar liya
 She refused to come out
 dekhte-dekhte vahaan kuch mushtande ikatthe ho gaye or unhone daravaaje ko dhakiyana shuru kar diya
 "an attack on Tanushree's parents? On getting information, it was found out that the producers had called these people
 is bich police ai
 Amidst all this, Janice gets a chance to talk to Nana and Nana just says, "my daughter is like that
" " is baat kaa us maukey par koi matlab nahin tha
 Jainis told that in the meantime Tanushree's parents came there and their car was attacked
 gaadi kii wind shield tod di gai
 tanushree-nana controversy: Big b dodged the question, Aamir said - 'investigation Ho' was lying Tanushree Dutta? Later when Janis got a chance to meet Tanushree, she told her whole story
 jainis ke mutabik tanushri ne unhen bataaya ki 3 din kii practice ke baad koreographerganesh acharyane dance shoot kaa har ek step badal diya tha
 All this was done because the producers wanted Nana to dance with Dutta
 isi shoot main tanushri ne naanaa kii budtamiji kaa zikr kiya he
 This is Taimur Ali Khan's Naini, know how much salary you get? Did the director of the film speak? Meanwhile, after the matter escalated on Tanushree's statement, Rakesh Sarang, director of the film "horn Ok Please", said in a conversation with mid-day, "tanushreek is saying that Nathani Utlo was a solo dance song, for which she rehearsed
 to unhone taiyaari ke dauraan bhi yah gaanaa suna hoga
 How they don't remember that the song also had a mail voice

 Both Nitin Gadkari and Arun Jaitley have talked to Vasundhara and Vasundhara is coming to Delhi to meet the party high command
 sutron ke mutabik party vasundhara ko hi mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par saamne laana chaahati he or isapar koi matbhed nahin he
 Following the threat of Vasundhara's resignation, the infighting of the Rajasthan BJP has come to the fore
 lekin dilli main party kii press conference main kaha gaya ki rajasthan kaa masalaa party kaa andruni maamla he
 The matter that the BJP is trying to stake in the matter by declaring it as internal is actually a tug of war between the RSS and the BJP in Rajasthan
 gulab chand kataaria ne beshak apni prastaavit yatra waapas le lee ho lekin kataaria or vasundhara ke bich kii yah rassakashi bijepi ko aage bhi nastar kii tarah chubhti rahegi
 At the party's core committee meeting on Saturday, Vasundhara left the meeting midway, warning of her resignation
 iske baad haalanki kataaria ne apni prastaavit yatra sthagit kar di lekin vasundhara or unke samarthak is par bhi nahin maane or phir kendriya netritv par dabaab banane ke liye unke samarthakon ne istipha dene kaa silsilaa armbh kar diya
 These mlas have, however, submitted their resignations to Vasundhara not to the Speaker

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has termed all the reports as 'false' and 'baseless', stating that it has supported the beating of a man in UP on the rumor of eating beef

 However, RSS disassociated itself from this by saying that Panchajanya is not its mouthpiece
 sangh ke pravaktaa manmohan vaidya kii ore jari ek bayaan main kaha gaya, 'is tarah kii report ki aresas ne dadri ghatana kaa samarthan kiya he, puri tarah juthi or niraadhaar hai

 He clarified that Panchjanya in Hindi and Organizer in English are not mouthpieces of the association
 aresas kii ore se sirf ek aadhikarik padaadhikari hi bolta he
 Vaidya's statement came after publishing portions of the Panchajanya article in the mainstream media, which said that Islamic seminaries and Muslim leaders teach Indian Muslims to hate the country's tradition

 input: IANS Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is once again in controversy over the ownership of Dholpur Palace
 jaaniye is pales ke itihaas or bhugol ke bare main sab kuch:1
 The palace of Dholpur i
e
 Raj Niwas Palace was built by Raja Udaybhanu Singh, father-in-law of Vasundhara Raje
 vasundhara ke pati raja hemanth singh ko unke naanaa udaybhanu singh ne god le liya tha, yani vah unke dattak putr the
 According to the documents of Dhaulpur Municipal Council and Tehsil Office, the area of rajmahal and land around it in Khasra No
 875 is 45 bighas a Biswa
 2003 main pehali baar rajasthan kii mukhyamantri banane ke baad vasundhara ne apane mahal kii charadivari pachaas meter aage badha di thi
 The most interesting thing is that according to court documents, Vasundhara and her son Dushyant's case was going on with Raja Hemant Singh over the right to property
 iskaa faisla 19 may 2007 ko aayaa
 That is, the settlement of the property took place in May 2007
 lekin nagar parishad ke dastavejon ke mutabik sampatti dushyant ke naam 11 june 2004 ko hi ho gai
 Now the city council does not have the answer to how the three years later, the city council president got rid of it in 2004 itself
 2
 The palace is built almost in a bigha
 isamen pachaas se zyada kamare hai
 There are two courtyards
 mukhyamantri banane ke agle hi saal 2004 main vasundhara ne puraane mahal kaa jirnoddhar karaayaa or use heritage hotel bana diya
 The tourism department had then allocated three and a half crore rupees for the maintenance of historical heritage
 us rakam se ek or mahal banwaaya gaya
 Vasundhara Raje stays there only when she comes to Dhaulpur
 3
 The 45 bighas of land surrounding the palace are recorded in government documents as non-residential areas
 yani kheti kii jameen he
 But when a flyover was being built on the National Highway, Vasundhara pressurized the highway and changed it slightly and passed it near the boundary of his palace
 iske baad kheti kii jameen kaa lagbhag do karod rupee muaavja vyavsaayik dar par vasuul kiya
 4
 sarkaar apni thi, lihaaja vasundhara ne rajmahal ke aas-paas kii kheti kii jameen ko bhi vyavsaayik munaafe vaali banane kaa intjaam kar liya
 In fact, there were three historic parks - Gandhi Park, Nehru Park and Subhash Park, adjacent to the palace boundary
 vasundhara ne nagar parishad se milakar teenon parkon ko ek karvaa diya
 Moved the park adjacent to its boundary 25 feet further
 khaali jagah par menrod nikaal di taaki mahal kii khaali padi jameen par mal, commercial complex yaa anya vyavsaayik imaarat banaakar uskaa karodon rupee kaa masik kiraaya vasula jaae
 5
 rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje dhaulpur kii purv riyasat kii maharani kehalaati hai
 They have neither any kind of land nor any house or other property
 pichley vidhansabha chunaavon ke samay vasundhara raaje dhaulpur main 20 bigha krishi bhoomi kii malkin jarur thim, lekin is baar yah jameen bhi unke paas nahin rahi
 He has given this information in the property details presented along with the nominations for the last assembly elections
 wo teen karod 96 lakh 28 hajaar kii kul sampatti kii malkin hai
 Among them are shares, bonds and debentures worth Rs 2 crore 37 thousand, while 26 lakh 62 thousand 190 rupees are deposited in the name of Vasundhara Raje in banks and other financial institutions
 unke paas 55 lakh 50 hajaar kii anya parisampattiyaan hai jinka khulaasa nahin kiya gaya he
 Also, they have gold worth 38 lakh 55 thousand 300 rupees
 nakadi ke rup main unke paas saadhe solah hajaar rupye hai
 In these five years, the wealth of Vasundhara Raje has increased by one crore 19 lakhs
 vaise uplabdhi ke taur par dekha jaae to vasundhara raaje in paanch saalon main karj se mukt jarur ho gai hai
 6
 7 may 2007 ko dhaulpur kii jila adaalat main saalon se chal rahe is raaj parivaar ke ek mukademe main sulah ho chuki he
 According to this, Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje will continue to be the former Maharani of Dholpur
 unke 'purv maharani' kahalaane par unke pati 'purv maharaja' hemanth singh ko koi aapatti nahin hogi
 This condition is part of the reconciliation that took place between Hemant Singh and his MP son Dushyant Singh in a court in Bharatpur on 7 May 2007
 adaalat main pesh pita or putr ke is sulahanaame ke baad dhaulpur rajgaraane main pichley 29 saal se chalaa aa rahaa sampatti vivaad nipat gaya
 According to the agreement, Hemant Singh will keep all the properties in Delhi, while all the properties in Dholpur and other places will be owned by Dushyant Singh
 7
 It is worth mentioning that in 1978, the then Rajmata of the Gwalior family, the late Vijay Raje Scindia, had filed a claim of property division in the court of Dholpur on behalf of his minor Navas Dushyant Singh in 1978
 khaas baat yah ki is maamle main vasundhara raaje ke bhi mukhyamantri rahete hue 11 sitambar, 2005 ko bayaan darj hue the
 In a statement before the court-appointed commissioner in Delhi in favor of his son Dushyant Singh, Vasundhara Raje had said that the property of the Dholpur royalty is owned by Dushyant Singh under the Hindu Succession Act
 ab dhaulpur kaa shahi mahal 'city pales', bavargama pales or agra, shimla, banaras va anya sthanon par maujuud chal-achal sampatti par saansad dushyant singh kaa swaamitv hoga
 They will also have the right to the diamonds and jewels and other precious royal items present in them
 dilli sthit sangh lok seva ayog kii imaarat dhaulpur house (upiessi) or dhaulpur sthit rajanivas pales main ek badi samanta yah he ki donon ke purv maalik ek hi hai
 Both these buildings once used to be the properties of Raja Hemant Singh, the former husband of Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and father of MP Dushyant Singh

 Recently, due to the Lalit Modi case, the Rajnivas Palace Hotel in Dholpur has been in dispute, it was once his property
 heritage hotel hone kaa darja hasil kar chuke is hotel main dushyant singh, unki patni niharika, maa vasundhara raaje va paariwarik mitra rahe lalit modi ke share hai
 This hotel is the property of the Niyant Heritage Hotel, whose share of 10 rupees was bought by Lalit Modi at the rate of Rs 96,180
 is hotel kaa itihaas kaaphi rochak he
 The area in Dholpur in which it is located was also a victim of family disputes
 itihaas main darj he ki madhyakaal main mughal rajya ke sansthaapak babar ko yah sthaan kaaphi ramnik lagata tha
 Even later Mughal emperors stayed on it
 jahangir se uske yuvaraj bete shahjahan ne anurodh kiya tha ki vah ise saunp den
 He felt that the request would be approved, so he sent his officers there before getting the approval
 magar jahangir kii priy begum malikaa noorjahan ko bhi yah jagah bahut pasand thi
 She had also expressed her wish to the king in this regard
 vah shahjada shehryaar ke liye yah jagah chaahati thim
 He sent Sharif ul Malik as its administrator
 dhaulpur par kabje ko lekar donon hi guton main khooni sangharsh hua or nau log maare gaye
 This made King Jahangir very angry and sent Yuvraj far away from there
 peshwa or maraathon ke kaal main bhi yah mahal charchaa main rahaa

 laal pathar se bane is mahal ke antim raja udaibhaan the
 He died very soon

 agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main rashtriya lok samta party (araspi) endie ke saath rahegi yaa phir mahagathbandhan kaa daaman thamegi isko lekar sanshay kii sthiti bani hui he
 RLSP supremo and Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha have indicated many times in gestures that if his party is not given a respectable seat in the NDA, then he can enter the Grand Alliance
 bihar menciton ke talmelko lekar pichley kuch dinon se bijepi or uske sahyogi dalon ke bich baatcheet kaa silsilaa chal rahaa he
 The maximum tussle for grabbing maximum seats can be seen between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal United (JDU)
 sambhavit formule se naarazgisiton ke talmail ko lekar kai tarah ke formule bhi saamne aa rahe hai jinamein se ek formula he ki bijepi 40 main se 20 siton par chunaav lade or baaki bachi 20 siton main 12 jadyu ko, 6 seat lojpa ko or 2 seat araspi ko di jaae
 In the last Lok Sabha election, the BJP had given 3 seats to the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and won only three, but this time the matter of 2 seats is coming out, for which Upendra Kushwaha is very angry
 isi kram main bijepi par dabaav banane ke liye upendra kushvaha ne patna main mangalvaar ko paigaam-e-kheer naam se ek kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya
 To say that the purpose of this program was to give a message of increasing harmony in the society, but its real purpose was to send a message to the BJP that if the RLSP does not get respectable seats, then they can take some other decision
 paigaam-e-kheer kaarykram main upendra kushvaha ne khud kheer banaai or apane party ke kaaryakartaaon ko khilaayaa
 Contribution of many people in 'kheer', while interacting with the devotees, Upendra Kushwaha said that the milk made by Yaduvanshis, rice Kushwaha caste, Chinese Brahmin society, Panchmeva ultra backward caste people To give and sanctify it, Tulsi has come from the house of Dalits
 in sab ke upar kushvaha ne bataaya ki kheer khaane ke liye dastarkhan muslim samaaj ne diya
 Attacking the BJP in gestures through this program, Upendra Kushwaha said that the main objective of his program is that no one should get more Kheer or less, that is, he should get as much as he deserves
 JDU se vot bank zyadaupendra kushvaha kii party araspi kai maukon par yah daawa kar chuki he ki uske paas is vakt bihar main 10% vot bank he jisamen kushvaha, koiri or dhanuk samaaj maujuud he jabaki nitish kumaar kii party jadyu ke paas keval 2% kurmi samaaj kaa vot bank he
 The party wants to send a message to the BJP that RLSP should get more seats than JDU due to having more vote banks
 yahaan yah bataanaa jaruri he ki ek maheene pehle ek kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue upendra kushvaha ne kaha tha ki agar yaduwanshiyon kaa doodh or kushvaha samaaj kaa chaaval mil jaae to badhiya kheer ban sakati he
 Kushwaha's statement clearly meant that if the BJP could not give him a respectable seat, he could join the Grand Alliance in alliance with the RJD
 upendra kushvaha ke is bayaan kaa argedy netaa tejasvi yadav ne bhi samarthan kiya tha or unhen mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone ke liye aamantrit bhi kiya tha
 However, Kushwaha took a U-turn again the next day and said that his statement had no meaning and that he would remain in the NDA

 (agency se input) Former Australian cricket captain Ian Chappell has said that if the Australian players are thinking of defeating the Indian team 4–0 in the four-match Test series, then they will have to stop Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag from playing big innings
 chapel ne kaha, "hamaari team agar sachin or sahvaag ko saste main out karne main safal rahi to bhartiya team ko thik usee tarah ghutane techne par majaboor hona padegaa, jis tarah usne england ke khilaaf teke the
 " chapel ne kaha, "sahvaag ko saste main out karne kaa matlab yah he ki bharat ko apeksha se aadhe score par roka ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, India's pace of scoring runs will also be halved
 sahvaag bhartiya ballebaaji kram kii utkrushtataa kaa pratik hai or unka wicket saste main girane kaa matlab bharat ko niraash karnaa he
 " chapel ke mutabik sidney sachin kaa pasandida maidan he or is maidan par unhen rokane ke liye mejabaan gendbaajon ko atirikt mehnat kerani hogi
 "our players still have no response to Sachin," said Chappell
 vah shandaar farm main dikh rahe hai
 So while Sydney is his favorite ground, he is expected to play big innings
 aise main mejabaan gendbaajon ko sachin ko out karne kaa rasta jald khojna hoga

 har raat rone ke baad vah rojaanaa subah ek khush vyakti kii tarah logon ke saamne pesh aati thim
 She used to do this for her children
 is bare main unhone kaha, "main dohari jindagi ji rahi thi
 When my husband (ayushmann Khurrana) lived on shooting, i used to spend all my time crying throughout the night
 lekin subah hote hi mere chehre par khushi hoti thi, jisase main apane bacchon ke saamne ek lujar kii tarah na dikhuun
 i never understood my body, mind and soul as one unit
 maine hameshaa yahi sochaa ki shaareerik swasthya jaruri he or mently to kuch hota hi nahin he
 That's why i used to exercise a lot
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki cancer nakaaratmakataa ko panaah de rahaa tha
 i went to the doctor and they told me clinically depressed
 "today is my day! Wish you all a happy # worldcancerday and hope each one of us celebrates this day in an embracing way
 That we remove any stigma or taboo associated with it
 That we spread awareness about it and that we have self love no matter what
 i truly embrace all my scars as they are my badges of honor
 There is nothing known as perfect
 Happiness lies in truly accepting yourself
 This was a tough one for me
 But this picture was my decision as i want to celebrate not the disease but the spirit with which i endured
 To quote my mentor, Diasaku Ikeda, “leading an undefeated life is eternal victory
 Not being defeated, never giving up, is actually a greater victory than winning, not being defeated means having the courage to rise to the challenge
 However many times we're knocked down, the important thing is we keep getting up and taking one step-even a half step- forward” # worldcancerday # breastcancerawareness # breastcancerwarrior # turningkarmaintomission # boddhisatva Thanks @atulkasbekar for this onea post shared by tahirakashyapkhurrana (@tahirakashyap) on Feb 3, 2019 at 11:32pm pstisa bare main bataate hue tahiraa kashyap ne aage kaha ki buddha chanting ke jariye unhen apane swasthya or dimag ko durust rakhane main sahaayta mili

 " bataa den ki tahiraa kashyap or actor ayushmaan khurana (ayushmann Khurrana) ne saal 2008 main shaadi kii thi or ve do bacchon ke mata-pita bhi hai
 At the same time, talking about the work front, Ayushmann Khurrana will soon be seen in the film Shubh Mangal more careful

 shuukravaar ko manipur ke purv mukhyamantri or ab vipaksh ke netaa okaram ibobi singh ne pradesh ke rajyapal jagadish mukhi se mulaakaat kii
 Ibobi Singh gave a letter to the Governor demanding the dismissal of the bjp-led government in Manipur

 Whereas BJP was the second party with 21 mlas
 chitthee main daawa kiya gaya he ki mananeey rajyapal ne bina vivek kaa istemaal kiye bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa diya jisane NPP, NPF aadi jaisi anya partiyon ke saath chunaav baad gathbandhan kiya tha
 Congress, the largest party in Manipur, said that the 60-member Manipur Assembly had a majority figure of 31 and the BJP was 10 seats away with 21 seats
 tab bijepi ne naga pipuls front (4), neshnal piples party (4) or lokjanshkti party (1) or 1 nirdaleey kaa samarthan juta kar bahumat paane main safalataa pai thi

 Ibobi Singh referred to Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala inviting bjp's Yeddyurappa to form the government as the leader of the largest party

 There the Congress and JDS post-poll alliance had a majority figure
 chitthee main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki sabhi rajyon main rajyapalon ko sarkaar banane ke liye nyotaa dete vakt ek jaise siddhant kaa hi paalan karnaa chahie
 Pointing to another disturbance in Manipur, Ibobi Singh said that the BJP government there was formed even before the completion of the term of the previous assembly, which is a complete violation of the Constitution and the law
 congress ne daawa kiya ki jabaki manipur main khandit janadesh tha lekin congress ne 28 seat jiti thim jobahumat se sirf 3 dur tha, iske myne saaf the ki manipur kaa janadesh congress ke saath tha
 Ibobi Singh has also written to the Governor in the letter- 'I assure you that whatever time you give, we will prove our majority in the House which will be in the interest of the people of Manipur

 jeliang ne ye sawaal bhi kiya he ki enpief ko sabase badi party ke naate kyon nahin nyotaa diya gaya or kyon nahin bahumat sabit karne ke liye 15 din kaa vakt diya gaya
 Former Nagaland Chief Minister Zeliang has claimed that it is the right time to consider the sincerity of the states in the states due to the recent developments in Karnataka and the logical questions raised by the biggest parties from Bihar, Goa and Manipur regarding it
 nagaland main 18 siton vaali nesanalist democratic progressive party ne bijepi ke 12 or jediu ke ek or ek nirdaleey vidhayak ke samarthan se sarkaar banaai thi

 yah sahi nahin he
 Do not try to divide hindu-muslims again
 srilanka ke tamil hinduon ke bare main bhi is bill main kuch nahin he
 'at the same time he said,' Our doubts should be distance
 agar hamen santoshjanak jawaab nahin mila to loksabhaa main hamaara jo rukh tha, ab vah alag hoga
 'significantly, Shiv Sena members were absent during the voting in Rajya Sabha on the Citizenship Amendment Bill
 is par shivasena ke rajyasabha sadsy anil desai ne kaha ki unki party vivaadit naagarikta (sanshodhan) vidheyak par ucch sadan main hue matdaan ke dauraan anupasthit rahi kyonki sarkaar ne santoshjanak jawaab nahin diya

 125 votes were cast in favor of the bill while 105 members voted against it
 shivasena ne voting ke dauraan rajyasabha se walkout kiya
 The bill provides for Indian citizenship to people from Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who came to India due to religious persecution from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan
 rajyasabha ne buudhvaar ko vistrut charchaa ke baad is vidheyak ko paarit kar diya
 The House rejected the opposition's proposal and amendments to send the bill to the Select Committee
 vidheyak ke paksh main 125 mat pade jabaki 105 sadasyon ne iske khilaaf matdaan kiya
 During this time there was a lot of uproar in the house
 grih mantri amit shah ne sadan main kaha, 'jo alpsankhyak baahar se hamaare desh main aae, unhen raahat mili he
 People from three neighboring countries came to our country
 vahaan unhen samanta kaa adhikaar nahin mila
 They were stumbling rate by rate in their country
 vah log ummid lekar bharat aae the
 This bill is like a ray of hope for millions of people
 ye bill dharmik prataditon ke liye he
 i want to draw the attention of the people of the country through this house
