 ) bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke adhyaksh nitin gadakari ek baar phir apane bayaan ko lekar vivaadon main aa gaye hai
 This time his statement has come in reference to Swami Vivekananda
 gadakari ne vivekanand ke aikyuu (intelligence kwoshans) yani bauddhik str kii tulana mafia don daaud ibrahim ke aikyuu se kar di
 However, Gadkari, after creating a ruckus on it, said that his statement was presented in the wrong context
 bhopal main ravivaar shaam ek puraskaar samaaroh main apane vaktavy main gadakari ne kaha tha, "manovigyaan main ham logon kaa aikyuu str maapte hai
 
 lekin yah vyakti-vyakti par nirbhar karata he ki vah apni buddhi kaa istemaal kis kshetra main karata he
 " gadakari ne rabindra bhawan main vibhinn kshetron kii agrani mahilaon ke sammaan ke liye yojit ojaswini alankaran samaaroh main kaha, "yadi ham swami vivekanand ke aikyuu str kii tulana daaud ibrahim ke aikyuu str se karen to donon kaa aikyuu str samaan dikhataa he
 But the life direction of both is completely opposite
 vivekanand ne iskaa upyog jahaan raashtra nirmaan, bhaichaargi or aadhyatm ke liye kiya, vahiin daaud ne iskaa upyog vinaashkari uddeshyon ke liye
 " is bayaan par raajnneetik halake main tikhi pratikriya hui
 The Congress demanded an apology from Gadkari for this statement
 jab samvaadadaataaon ne gadakari ko gheraa to unhone kaha, "maine swami vivekanand or daaud ibrahim ke bich koi tulana nahin kii
 
 maine kaha tha ki yadi koi vyakti apni buddhi kaa sahi istemaal kare to vah vivekanand yaa phir daaud ibrahim ban saktaa he
 "gadkari said," misrepresented my statement
 " The Congress said that Gadkari's remarks reflected his party's level of thinking and mindset
 iske saath hi congress ne maafee maangane kii unase maang kii
 Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari said that Gadkari's remarks are another explanation of his bjp's culture and mentality
 tiwari ne kaha ki keval safai hi kaaphi nahin he or bhaajapa ko is desh kii janata se maafee maangani chahie, khaastaur se soch-samaj rakhane waalon se or desh ke netaaon se
 Congress National Secretary Digvijay Singh condemned Gadkari's statement that Gadkari is the representative of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and he speaks the same language as the Sangh
 guna main singh ne samvaadadaataaon se charchaa karte hue kaha ki gadakari ke bayaan par sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat, bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani va gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se jawaab maanga he
 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ajay Singh said that Gadkari's statement is going to reveal the real face of the BJP

 Congressmen also took to the streets against Gadkari's statement

 Youth Congress and Congress workers on Monday burnt effigies of Gadkari at the board office intersection

 The Youth Congress has warned that if Gadkari does not apologize, there will be a statewide agitation
 udhar, bhaajapa netaa gadakari ke bayaan par safai dene main jute rahe
 BJP leader Balbir Punj on Monday denied that Gadkari compared Vivekananda to Dawood
 unhone kaha, "unhone vivekanand kii tulana daaud se nahin kii, unhone sirf donon ke bich ke virodhabhas ko spasht kiya
 " punj ne kaha ki gadakari sirf yah kah rahe the ki kisi bhi tarah kii satta, dhan yaa buddhi ko achche yaa bure kaamon main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Industries Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya came out openly in defense of Gadkari
 tippaniyan Vijayvargiya has said that the statements given about Vivekananda and Dawood are being taken incorrectly
 gadakari ke bayaan ko sakaaratmak rup se liya janaa chahie, unhone to budghimatta ke istemaal kii vyakhya karte hue hi daaud kaa naam liya tha
 Supporting the statement, Vijayvargiya said that whenever Rama is discussed, Ravana is mentioned, in the same way Kansa is discussed with Krishna
 iskaa arth yah nahin he ki donon ko ham baraabar khadey kar rahe hai
 In his statement at an award ceremony in Bhopal on Sunday evening, Gadkari said, "in psychology we measure the IQ level of people
 
 But it depends on the person in which field he uses his intelligence
 " "if we compare Swami Vivekananda's IQ level with the IQ level of both, we look similar," Gadkari said at the Ojaswini Investiture Ceremony organized at the Rabindra Bhavan to honor leading women from various fields
 lekin donon kii jivan disha bilkul vipareet he
 While Vivekananda used it for nation building, brotherhood and spirituality, Dawood used it for destructive purposes
 " There was a sharp reaction to this statement in political circles
 congress ne is bayaan ke liye gadakari se maafee maangane kii maang kii
 When reporters surrounded Gadkari, he said, "I did not make any comparison between Swami Vivekananda and Dawood Ibrahim
 
 i said that if a person uses his intellect properly, he can become Vivekananda or Dawood Ibrahim
 " gadakari ne kaha, "mere bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 " congress ne kaha ki gadakari kii tippanee unki party kii soch ke str or maansikta ko jaahir karti he
 With this, the Congress demanded an apology from him
 kendriya soochna evam prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne kaha ki gadakari kii tippanee unki bhaajapa kii samskruti or maansikta kaa ek or spashtikaran he
 Tiwari said that cleanliness alone is not enough, and the BJP should apologize to the people of this country, especially to the wise and the leaders of the country
 congress ke rashtriya mahasachiv digvijay singh ne gadakari ke bayaan kii ninda karte hue kaha ki gadakari rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ke numaayinde hai or ve vahi bhashaa bolte hai, jo sangh kii hoti he
 Talking to reporters in Guna, Singh said that he has sought answers from Gadkari on Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, senior BJP leader LK Advani and Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh ajay singh ne kaha ki gadakari kaa bayaan bhaajapa ke asli chehre ko ujagar karne vaala he
 Gadkari's black conduct of corruption has been exposed, which has affected his mental balance
 gadakari ke bayaan ke khilaaf congressi sadakon par bhi utar aae
 He demanded a public apology by burning an effigy of Gadkari
 yuvak congress va congress kaaryakartaaon ne somvaar ko board offis chauraahey par gadakari ke putale kaa dahan kiya
 Also, a public apology has been demanded from Gadkari
 yuvak congress ne chetavanee di he ki agar gadakari ne maafee nahin maangi to pradeshvyapee andolan kiya jayega
 On the other hand, BJP leaders were busy clarifying on Gadkari's statement
 bhaajapa netaa balbir punj ne somvaar ko isse inkaar kiya ki gadakari ne vivekanand kii tulana daaud se kii he
 He said, "he did not compare Vivekananda to Dawood, he only explained the contradiction between the two
" " Punj said that Gadkari was just saying that any kind of power, money or intelligence can be used for good or bad works
 is bich, madhya pradesh ke udyog mantri kailash vijayawargeey gadakari ke bachaav main khulkar saamne aae
 The comments vijayawargeey ne kaha he ki vivekanand va daud ko lekar die gaye bayaan ko galat tareeke se liya ja rahaa hai
 Gadkari's statement should be taken positively, he had taken Dawood's name only while explaining the use of intelligence
 bayaan kaa samarthan karte hue vijayawargeey ne kaha ki jab bhi ram kii charchaa hoti he to ravan kaa zikr aata hi he, thik isi tarah krishna ke saath kansa kii charchaa hoti he
 This does not mean that we are standing equal to both

 Although the Congress also presented evidence of his involvement, Sapna also shared a photo with BJP leader Manoj Tiwari in response on Monday
 siyaasi galiyaaron main ye atakalein tej thim ki sapana choudhary congress main shaamil hongi or mathura seat se hemamalini ke khilaaf utrengi
 But the Congress had dismissed these speculations by making Mahesh Pathak a candidate from Mathura
 iske baad mana ja rahaa tha ki congress kisi or seat se unhen maidan main utaar sakati he
 Meanwhile, Sapna Chaudhary's pictures with Priyanka Gandhi also went viral on social media
 lekin sapana choudhary ne ravivaar ko achaanak bayaan dekar sabko chaunkaa diya ki vah naa to abhi congress main shaamil hui hai or naa hi aage aisi koi yojana he

 Pakistan on Monday asked India to provide information as soon as possible about the investigation in the Samjhauta train blast case in 2007

 Director General in the Ministry of External Affairs (south Asia) Afrasiyab Mehdi Hashmi has asked GV Srinivas, Executive Deputy High Commissioner of India, Pakistan, to provide this information
 unhone shrinivas se kaha ki jaanch main tarakkee ko lekar jaankaree yathashighra muhaiyaa karaayi jaani chahie
 In a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, apparently citing Swami Aseemanand's confession in a New Delhi court, the Indian diplomat brought attention to media reports about the investigation of the Samjhauta Express blast case in February 2007 Gone
 videsh mantralay ke bayaan main kaha gaya, unase is baat ko doharaaya gaya ki pakistan sarkaar samjhauta express visphot maamle main jaanch ko lekar bharat sarkaar dwaara kii gayi pragati kaa intjaar kar rahi he

 But if someone says that neither ISIS will be ruined nor America's expectations will be fulfilled, what will you call it? If there was a modest person to say this, perhaps the world would blow these things up in the air
 lekin ye bhavishyavaanee he ek aisi mahila kii, jisaki kahi sau main 85 baaten sahi sabit ho chuki hai
 For this reason, ISIS is happy now after Trump's victory in America
 ji haa, apni ek se bad kar ek sateek bhavishyavaaniyon se sabko chaunkaa dene vaali marhoom bhavishyavaktaa baba wanga kii ek bhavishyavaanee ne ab puri duniya ko baichaiyn kar diya he
 Well, even after making these prophecies to Baba Wanga, many years have passed, but since the time for this prophecy to be proved true or false is now very close, so people have been scared
 unamem dar kii tarange hilaa de rahi he
 The prophet Baba Wanga had said that two steel birds would wreak havoc in America, after which the twin towers were attacked by a plane
 usne kaha samandar main aayaa toofaan sabakuch bardaad kar degaa, iske baad japan main bhayanak tsunami aa gai
 Then he said that one black would be the last American president
 iske baad baraak obama america ke raashtrapati chun liye gaye
 Now according to this prediction of Baba Wanga, now the end of America is very close
 kyonki is baar shwet raashtrapati bana he
 His prediction says that a person of African descent will prove to be the 44th and last president of America
 ittefaq se baraak obama hi america ke 44wein or africa mul ke raashtrapati hai
 Whose term is now nearing completion
 bulgaria kii netraheen bujurg bhavishyavaktaa baba wanga to saal 1996 main hi is duniya ko alavida kah chuki hai, lekin unki kahi gai baaten unke jane ke baad bhi sach sabit hoti raheen hai
 Wanga had said that a person of African descent would be the last president of America
 vaise bhi obama se pehle koi bhi ashwet america kaa raashtrapati nahin ban sakaa
 In such a situation, as soon as Barack Obama held this biggest chair of America
 bahut se logon ko ye lagane laga ki baba wanga kii bhavishyavaanee kaa pehla hissaa sach sabit ho chukaa he
 But since the second part of this prediction is extremely frightening and disturbing, people are beginning to get restless as the hour of Barack Obama's term ends
 logon ke man main kai tarah ke sawaal tair rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question arises that will Donald Trump, who has just been elected president, not be able to take his oath of office? After all, what will be the thing that will stop Trump from doing so? Will America cease to exist after Obama? If so how? Obviously, these are questions that can make anyone nervous
 baba wanga kii baton par yakeen karanevaale or khaas kar unki bhavishyavaaniyon ko pehle hi sach sabit hota hua dekhne vaale log ab sakate main hai
 Baba Wanga is not simply compared to Nostradamus
 85 saal kii umr main is duniya se janevaali baba wanga ne kareeb 100 badi bhavishyavaaniyan kii thim, jinamein se 85 bhavishyavaaniyan bilkul sahi sabit huin
 Among these predictions, the prediction related to the US President is one, but the prediction related to ISIS, which seems to be proved in pieces, true
 is bhavishyavaanee ke mutabik saal 2010 main muslim war kii shuruyaat hogi, jo 2016 tak puriduniyaamein fail jaaegi

 He also said that Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj is likely to be the face of this national organ donation awareness program
 'ang daan ko lekar logon main galat dharanaenuesai ke rashtriya sanyojak dow kumaar ne kaha ki logon main ang daan ko lekar galat dharanaen hai

 At that time it should have been a good opportunity for him to go to an important post
 lekin swami ne ek anya ubharate star rajaneta atal bihari vaajapeyi ko apana shatru bana liya tha
 Swamy later claimed that Morarji Desai wanted to give him a place in the cabinet, perhaps he wanted to make him the Minister of State for Finance, but Vajpayee, the then foreign minister, had a hindrance
 bees saal baad ek aatmakatha main, jo ek tamil saptahik patrika main kishton main chhapi thi, swami ne vaajapeyi ko ghor piyakkad bataaya tha
 Swamy says that when Vajpayee became prime minister for the second time in 1998, he refused to make him finance minister
 pratyaksh rup se jab unhen pataa chalaa ki unke gathbandhan ko jayalalita kaa samarthan mil gaya he to ve apni jubaan se palat gaye
 Swami retaliated by bringing Sonia Gandhi and Jayalalitha together in a tea party, after which Jayalalitha withdrew her support from the Vajpayee government and the government fell
 yah vahi sonia hai jinhen swami phooti aankh bhi nahin dekhnaa chaahate hai or yah vahi jayalalita hai jinke khilaaf swami ne bhrashtachar kaa mukadmaa daayar kiya tha or unki giraftaar hui thi
 Swamy's career is proof that friendship and enmity cannot be distinguished in politics
 swami 1990 se 1991 tak chandrashekhar kii alpavadhi kii sarkaar main chaar maheene ke liye kendriya vaanijya or kanoon mantri rahe the
 Iyer says that he "had a good rapport with Rajiv Gandhi" and that is why "gandhi is the only person in the family whom Swami does not abuse
" " ayyar ke mutabik, yah is baat kaa saboot he ki ''swami kitne asthir vyakti hai or unke bachakaane vyaktitv main bahut tej dimag daal diya gaya he
 "as a supporter of Hindu Rashtra, attention has been drawn Swami has again attracted the attention of the people in the last half decade as a staunch supporter of Hindu Rashtra and an enemy of corrupt people

 His relations with the Sangh are now good, but in 2000, Swami wrote an article in the fortnightly magazine Fortnite, warning of "growing fascism in the RSS"
 unhone likhaa, acchhee khabar yah he ki ''yah chaal vifal ho sakati he
 
 
 The powers of Mother India will not allow it to succeed

 Chidambaram's son Karti had worked with him in the hawala case against Chidambaram — saying that he is a "straight talker" and that he has no selfish interest

 According to a BJP source, due to Jaitley, Swamy could not get a Lok Sabha ticket from Delhi in 2014
 yah kahani sahi ho yaa galat, swami ko shaayad is par yakeen he
 So they have fallen behind the Finance Minister
 iske alaava jetali ke paas vah mantralay he, jo swami hameshaa se apane liye chaahate the
 Swami prefers to resort to his Twitter weapon while avoiding direct targeting on Jaitley
 bhartiya adhikariyon ke bare main unki tippanee ki ve pashchimi kapadon main waiter lagate hai, masterpis thi or jetali ke ahan ko chot pahunchane or unhen haasyaaspad banane vaali thi, jiske baad jetali ko pradhanmantri or bijepi adhyaksh se shikaayat kerani padi
 Any analyst targeting the people sitting in big positions would conclude that Swamy was used to remove Rajan
 apni is safalataa se utsahit hokar swami ne apni bandook kii nalee subrahmanyam kii taraf ghuma di
 He said on Twitter, "sack them
" " or uske aage kul paanch vismayabodhak chinh laga die
 In a clever tweet later, he mentioned "washington dc's Arvind Subrahmanyam
" " apane dushman kii ''bhartiyata" par kalank lagaana swami kaa pasandida shagal he
 Three years ago, he filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court seeking the removal of the then editor of the Hindu newspaper Siddharth Varadarajan, as he was a US citizen
 swami kaa kahana tha ki kisi bhartiya akhbaar ke sampadak ko sirf bharat kaa nivasee hi nahin, balki bharat kaa naagarik bhi hona chahie
 Talking on the phone, Varadarajan, founder of the news website The Wire, said that "it is very difficult for the BJP to challenge Swamy
" aisa karne main bijepi ko apane un dhurrashtravaadi samarthakon kaa hi virodh jhelana pad saktaa he, jinke liye swami khari-khari bolne vaale hero hai
 "what is usefulness for the party? a BJP leader says that the party is tolerating Swamy because of" his genius "and his ability to plague opponents
 aisa lagata he ki swami ke saarvajanik bayaan bhale hi kuch logon ko gudgudate hon lekin unase party ke bheetar matbhed jaahir ho jate hai
 In view of Swami's qualifications, his present condition is truly sad

 aaj mahashivaratri he or subah- subah hi mandiron ke baahar lambii kataren dekhne ko mil rahi hai
 In this diverse country, Lord Bhole is pleased in different ways
 desh main sthapit shiv ke 12 jyotirlingon kaa apana mahatv or itihaas he
 It is said that there are 5 types of Aarti of Lord Shiva but the most important Aarti is considered 'bhasma Aarti'
 ji haa, madhyapredash ke mahakaleshrwar jyotirling main kii jaati he bhasma aarti or ye aaj se nahin balki pracheen kaal se kii ja rahi he
 So let us tell you today on this auspicious occasion, the secret of Bhasma Aarti and the method of performing it - According to the myths of Bhasma Aarti, Maharaj Chandrasen was ruled in Ujjain many years ago
 wo bhagwaan shiv ke parambhakt the or vahaan kii praja bhi unhen bahut puujati thi
 Once King Ripudaman attacked Chandrasen's palace and tortured the subjects there through demon corruption
 tab sabhi ujjain vaasiyon ne mahadev ko yaad kiya or unase madd kii guhaar lagaai
 It is said that Mahadev heard his call and himself came and killed the evil demon
 sirf yahi nahi, bhagwaan ne dooshan kii raakh se apana shringaar kiya or hameshaa ke liye vahaan bas gaye
 In this way, the place was named Mahakaleshwar and started the Bhasma Aarti of Mahadev
 bhasma aarti kii vidhiaisi manyata he ki bhasma aarti bhagwaan shiv ko jagaane ke liye kii jaati he
 For this reason, the Bhasma Aarti starts at four in the morning in Mahakaleshwar
 bataa den, bhasma ko puri vidhi vidhaan ke saath banaaya jaataa he
 Firstly, Kapila cow's condes, peepal, palash, shami and plum wood are lit together
 inako jalaate samay vahaan ke pujari mantrocchar bhi karte hai
 The bhasma is then filtered through cloth and offered to Mahadev
 mahakaleshrwar main shamshaan main jalaai pehali chita kii raakh se bhi bhagwaan bhole kaa shringaar kiya jaataa he
 According to Hinduism, if Mahadev is adorned with the person's pyre, then that person attains salvation
 kya he niyam?mahakaleshrwar main bhasma aarti ke samay mahilaon kaa janaa varjit he
 But women who are present there at that time are required to wear a saree
 iske alaava jis samay shivlinga par bhasma arpit kii jaati he, vahaan khadi sabhi mahilaon ko apana cheharaa ghunghat se dhak lenaa chahie
 It is said that at that time Mahadev is in formless form
 vaise kuch sakht niyam purashon ke liye bhi hai
 All the men who came there are required to wear cotton dhoti
 is mandir main koi aam vyakti khud shivlinga par bhasma arpit nahi kar saktaa
 Only the priests have this right
 bhasma kaa tilak kyon lagaate hai?mahashivaratri par bhasma kaa tilak lagane se mahadev ke sabhi bhakton ke paap dhul jate hai or unka jivan sadaiv tanavamukt or khushhaali se bharaa rahata he

 The innocent Divine, who lives in Ambedkar Chowk area of goregaon, fell into a nearby drain while playing late Wednesday night
 jiske baad pichley kareeb 20 ghante se maamoom ko bachaane ke liye search oparation chal rahaa he
 At the same time, the family members are in bad health

 The unhappy parents have lost consciousness and are misguided

 Due to the strong currents, it quickly flowed into the water

 He said that the NDA (national Democratic Alliance) government had created 80 lakh jobs every year but in UPA government this figure is not even 20 lakhs
 bhaajapa ne sarkaar ke is daawey par sawaal uthaaya ki rajya sarkarein bahu-brands khudara kaarobaar main epadiai kii anumati dene yaa na dene ke liye swatantra hai or kaha ki centre sarkaar ne 82 deshon ke saath dwipaksheeya nivesh ke samjhaute kiye hai jisase videshi niveshkon ko rashtriya str par kaarobaar karne kii chhot dena anivaary ho gaya he
 Therefore, this claim of the government is ridiculous
 javdekar ne kaha ki is praavdhaan kaa asar yah hoga ki sarkaar videshi niveshkon par ve sharte nahin laga paaegi jo gharelu niveshkon par lagu karne laayak nahin hai

 kii sampatti ke nuksaan kaa akalan he, lekin yahaan yah dhyaan dena hoga ki bihar ke alaava kisi duusare rajya ne ab tak nuksaan ke aankade centre ko nahin bheje hai
 That means the flood is about to be a month, but the central government does not even have an accurate picture of it yet
 par do rajyon ko chhodkar shesh desh main hui saamaanya yaa saamaanya se kam barish ke halaat main ai is baadh ne kuch chizon ko is tarah ujagar kiya he, jise chupaaya nahin ja saktaa
 These include corruption in irrigation projects, weak water management and poor disaster management
 bah gaye nae bane baandh or pulisaki baangi dekhni ho to chaliye purvi uttar pradesh ke baliya jile main
 The Ballia people who live on the banks of the Ganges are very aware of the fact that in the rainy day the river rises and their land lands
 iske liye ve sadiyon se maansik rup se taiyaar rahete aae hai
 But they were not ready for what happened here on 27 August
 rashtriya rajmarg-31 ke kareeb gopalpur gram panchayat main bana dube kaa chhapra ring baandh dopaher saadhe baarah baje tut gaya
 Uday Chhapra, Prasad Chhapra, Gopalpur and 35 nearby villages were washed away
 puure ghatnakram ne sarkari bhrashtachar kii pole kholkar rakh di
 The dam was built by the Birla Group in the year 1948
 teen varrsh pehle tak baandh kaa rakrakhaav nijee haathon main tha
 In 2013, when the dam was broken when the flood occurred, the government handed it over to the irrigation department

 baliya main baadh peediton kii madad main jute sinchai vibhaag ke purv ejeeniyar vireshwar raay bataate hai, ''sinchai vibhaag ne ring baandh ke punarnirmaan main jamkar bhrashtachar kiya he
 This is the reason that it did not withstand the first flood after being rebuilt
 ''baandh ke punarnirmaan se pehle hue vibhageeya survey ne iske plateform ko ji
 O
 takneekee yaa tub takneekee ke aadhaar par banane kii baat kahi thi, lekin sinchai vibhaag ne bambu cret vidhi ko apanaaya jo tej laharon ko roak paane main naakaam sabit hui he
 a similar situation also exists for the elgin-charasadi dam on the Ghaghra River in Barabanki
 2013 main ai baadh main yah baandh tutaa or sinchai vibhaag ne marammat ke naam par 10 karod ru
 Spent more than this but on 8 August this dam was flooded
 vaise, sinchai mantri shivpal yadav baandhon kii marammat main kisi bhrashtachar se inkaar karte hai
 "the report has been sent to the central government to ensure the elgin-charasadi dam, but in two years they have not paid a single penny," he says
 ''haadase hone ke baad mantriyon ke paas hameshaa se aise hi jawaab rahe hai
 But more than that which has happened to Ballia, more loot has been done in that Bundelkhand which is divided between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh
 upie sarkaar main sookhe se nijaat ke liye bundelkhand ko 7,200 karod ru
 Package of isse bahut se sookhaa raahat kaam hue
 But when the first normal rains came after the package, reports of dams and canals collapsed from areas of Madhya Pradesh
 panna jile main bundelkhand package ke tahat 32 karod ru
 The Sirswaha dam, built two years ago, washed away with water
 isi jile main 15 karod ru
 The rain-fed Birkhuda dam was also washed away
 tikamgarh ke samajasevi pawan ghuhaaraa kehete hai, ''bundelkhand package ke nirmaan kaaryon main baari aniyamitataayen barti gayi
 After the issue of Panna dams also arose in the assembly, the government was covering their flaws
 sarkaar ne jo jaanch karne kaa daawa kiya tha uske liye maine hycourt main yachika lagaai thi, jiskaa jawaab madhya pradesh sarkaar dedh saal main nahin de saki he
 "at the same time, after spending crores of rupees in Bandia Dam in Sagar district, soon after it cracked and recently the canal built in the Wanda area sank many villages

 thekedaar jees athvaal par 4 fisadi kii dar se jurmaana lagane kii baat ejeeniyar ne kahi he, jabaki website par bhugtan puraa dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 This flood has exposed many wonderful things of Madhya Pradesh
 baadh or sookhaa : ek sikke ke do pahalooman lijie ki desh kii sari sarkarein eemaandaar ho jaaen or afasar kaali kamai kii taraf dekhen bhi nahin to bhi kya ham baadh or sookhe se batch jaaenge, shaayad nahin, kyonki buniyadi cheez he jal prabandhan
 For example, understand the equation of flood in UP due to normal rains
 agast ke pehle hakrate main madhya pradesh or bundelkhand main hui saamaanya se 20 fisadi barish ne yahaan kii ken, betwa, dhasaan jaisi nadiyon main baadh ke halaat paidaa kar die
 The water of these rivers got into the Yamuna
 barish se pehle se ufnai ganga main jab yamuna aakar mili to elahabaad main sailaab aa gaya
 As the water in the Ganges progressed, disaster struck in the districts of Varanasi, Ghazipur, Ballia, en route
 varanasi ke kamisionar nitin gokarn ramesh kehete hai, ''betwa nadi par bane matatila baandh se 5 agast ko achaanak paanch lakh kusek pani choda gaya jisase sthiti or kharaab ho gai
 "the flash floods exposed the preventive arrangements of metros like Varanasi and Allahabad
 varanasi main varuna nadi ke kinare dub kshetra main niyam ko taak par rakhkar bane pakke makaanon ke chalate baadh ke pani ko rasta na mila or isane shahar main ghus kar jamkar tandav kiya
 Apart from this, about 300 crore in Varanasi
 kharch karke bichaai gai siver linon ko aapas main na jode jane ke kaaran inase baadh kaa pani nahin nikal paaya or sthiti gambhir ho gai
 Taking into account the implications of the Commissioner, there are two reasons for the Varanasi flood: first, the release of water from the Matatila dam some 400 km away, and that the drainage system of the city is weakened
 yani shahar ke pani se varanasi main baadh nahin ai, baahar ke pani se ai
 It also includes Nepal water
 lekin kya yah baahar kaa pani bhi hamaari nitigat kamajoriyaan se aayaa? uttar pradesh or khaskar bundelkhand ke ilaake main lambey samay tak kaam karne vaale varisht ejeeniyar ke
 K
 jain bataate hai, ''ken-betwa nadiyon ko jodgaye kii yojana 15 saal se lataki he
 Had this scheme come into force, 6 new dams would have been built in Bundelkhand
 aise main matatila baandh se utana pani nahin chhodia padataa jitna 5 agast ko choda gaya
 Pointing to the other side of the picture, Jain says that if these dams had been built, Bundelkhand would not have suffered the kind of drought that it has faced for the last four years
 yani baadh or sookhaa, ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 The only way to avoid both is to keep a lot of water in the rain and use it during the drought
 kamjor aapadaa prabandhanyahi pani jab varanasi or baliya se aage badhata he, to pahunch jaataa he bihar
 This eastern state is going through a strange situation at this time
 rajya main 31 agast tak saamaanya se 21 fisadi kam barish hui he
 Despite this, there are many districts where there is flood in the areas around the river and standing crop is drying up elsewhere
 thodaa peeche jaaen to pataa chalegaa ki july main nepal ke tarai kshetron main hui baari barish se uttar bihar kii mahananda, bakra, kanakai, parman, kosi, budhi gandak or gandak jaisi nadiyon main jal kaa bahaav tej ho gaya
 14 districts were affected by this while Jehanabad, Gaya and Nalanda suffered floods due to increasing flow of water in the river Falgu
 duusari taraf, jharkhand or madhya pradesh main adhik barish kaa asar bhi bihar ko bhugatna padataa he
 The water released from Mohammedganj barrage and Vansagar dam raised the water level of the Son River passing through South Bihar
 son kaa pani ganga main jaataa he
 This increased the water level of the Ganges
 isse 12 jile prabhavit hue hai
 Making the situation a lot easier, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that the profit from Farakka barrage is getting less and loss more
 centre sarkaar ko ise hataane par gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa chahie
 Due to the barrage, silt has accumulated in the Ganges
 mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki jab tak rashtriya gaad prabandhan niti gathit kar uskaa karyanvayan nahi hoga, tab tak barish ke kaaran ganga main baadh kaa khatra jhelane ko ham vivash honge
 The Chief Minister has also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and made him aware of the flood situation

 The barrage's water rose so high that it even flooded! Raghuvansh alleges that illegal mining and poor embankments in the rivers are the main cause of this flood

 "right dams are not built on the rivers descending from Nepal," he said
 aise main nepal apni jarurat bhar kaa pani rokkar baaki pani chhod detaa he
 There is also no such effective arrangement between the two countries that India should get accurate information about water from there
 aise main badi maatra main achaanak aane vaala pani bihar par kahar banakar tuutata he
 "noor believes that India should not only develop a better information system about the release of water from Nepal, but also agree to Nepal for better dam-making projects

 '' udhar, varanasi main sthiti yah he ki yahaan tainaat andiaref ke 900 javaanon main se 80 fisadi pehali baar baadh niyantran main kaam kar rahe hai
 An inspector says, "the force has personnel from central paramilitary forces deployed for five years on deputation

 yuvaraj singh ke paas bhale hi adhik anubhav he, lekin england ke khilaaf 21 july se shuru hone vaale pehle test match main acchhee form main chal rahe suresh raina ko bharat kii antim ekadash main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Like Yuvraj, left-handed batsman Raina is certain to be selected for the Lord's Test due to his consistent performance
 raina se paanch saal senior yuvaraj apane nau saal ke test kariyar main kabhi lords main test match nahin khel paae hai
 Lord's is the place where England achieved the target of 326 runs in the final of the natwest Trophy ODI Series in 2002
 yuvaraj ne tab 69 ran kii pari kheli thi
 Earlier, in the ODI match played at the same ground, Yuvraj scored 64 runs
 haal ke vishwa cap main bhi unhone behtareen pradarshan kiya
 On the other hand, Raina has worked hard to strengthen his place in the middle order and has tried to dismiss that short pitch balls are his weakness
 teji se uthati gendon ne raina ke liye unke test kariyar ke shuru main hi pareshaani paidaa kar di thi
 He was able to score five and one runs in the first Test match against South Africa at Centurion, after which he was not selected in the last XI in the next two Tests
 raina or yuvaraj kaa kariyar ab tak vipareet disha main aage badha he
 While Raina took advantage of opportunities, Yuvraj missed such opportunities
 saurav ganguli ke sanyas lene ke baad yuvaraj ko test team kaa niyamit sadsy mana ja rahaa tha
 But when he got a chance in Sri Lanka last year after having the flu, he scored a century in his first Test match
 iske baad yuvaraj ke liye test team main jagah bananaa aasaan nahin rahaa
 Yuvraj has scored 276 runs in four Tests against England so far, but this does not strengthen his claim as he has played all these matches on home soil

 ) Indian captain Virat Kohli has appealed to his batsmen to contribute in support of the bowling unit's brilliant efforts ahead of the Boxing Day Test against Australia in Melbourne starting Wednesday
 perth ke chunauteepurn wicket par captain kohli ne shandaar shatak jadaa tha, jabaki cheteshwar pujaara ne edilade main bharat kii jeet main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai, lekin anya ballebaaj gendbaajon kii barabari kaa yogadan nahin de paae, jinhone ab tak chaar pariyon main sabhi 40 wicket chatkaaye hai
 On the eve of the third Test, Kohli said, "it is very important for the batsmen to take responsibility, because everybody can see that our bowlers are doing very well
 anyathaa ham jo score bana rahe hai uske saath gendbaaj kuch bhi nahin kar paaenge
 "he said," If we bat later, we try to get the edge or get as close to the opposing team's score as possible
 agar aap bhi bada score banaate ho to phir yah duusari pari kaa muqabla ban jaataa he or agar aap pehali pari main acchhee badhat le lete hai to phir iskaa phayda uthaa sakate hai
 'know why rahul-vijay was fired, Hanuma said to the big chance,' The batsmen will have to make collective efforts
 main vyaktigat taur par nahin kahuunga ki kisi ko kya karne kii jarurat he, lekin ballebaaji ikai ke rup main nishchit taur par hamen behatar pradarshan karnaa hoga
 The Indian captain, however, clarified that his victory in the Adelaide Test on Melbourne Test or defeat in Perth Test would have no effect
 viraat ne kaha, ‘ek team ke rup main mujhe nahin lagata ki 2-0 se aage hone, 0-2 se pichhadane yaa 1-1 se baraabar hone kaa is par koi asar padataa he ki agle do test main kya hone vaala he
 Nathan Lyon has so far troubled the Indian batsmen by taking 16 wickets in two Tests and Kohli has praised this off-spinner
 unhone kaha, ‘leone kaaphi acha gendbaaj hai vah lagaataar achche kshetra main gendbaaji karte hai
 We should have a plan against this type of bowler so that we can also find options for scoring runs, because if he is allowed to bowl in one place for a long time then he will become more dangerous
 ’pichhali baar jab bharat emsiji par khelaa tha, to vah test drow samaapt hua tha
 Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane scored centuries in that match
 kohli ne kaha, ‘pichhali baar kisi bhi team ke paksh main nateeja nahin aane main pich kii badi bhoomika thi
 But now look at the pitch, it has a lot more grass than last time and i expect it to be a live pitch
 ’mayank ke naam he anokhaa record, team india main mila golden chanceunhone kaha, ‘ummid karti hum ki gendbaajon ko pehle do maichon kii tarah hi madad milegi, kyonki ek team ke rup main aapako pataa he ki is tarah se hameshaa aapako nateeja milegaa
 The day before we saw the pitch and it looks quite dry from below
 pich par kaaphi ghaas he jo sataha ko baandhakar rakhegi
 Kohli is playing the Boxing Day Test for the second time in Australia and is very keen about it
 unhone kaha, ‘yah behtareen he
 Of course the first day is the most important and we are expecting a lot of people to come, maybe more than 8 xxrep 4 0

 If you are unhappy about your 'relationship' and are on the verge of breaking up, then you have to understand a few things
 jab mail-milaap kii sari sambhaavnaaen khatm ho gai hon, to rishte ko jabaran dhonaa koi samajhadaari kii baat nahin kahi ja sakati
 In such a situation it is necessary to raise a bold step
 yahaan kuch aise tips bataae ja rahe hai, jisase aapako is daur main kaaphi madad milegi
 Here are some important tips, which you can use wisely: 1
 aapako yah baat dimag se nikaal deni chahie ki brallep ke liye aap hi jimmedaar hai
 You should believe in your mind that you have made every effort to improve the relationship
 2
 Never talk to your partner in a state of intoxication or excitement
 nashe kii avasthaa main kuch ulta-pulta bolne or phir baad main sori bolne se acha he ki aisa kaam hi na kiya jaae
 Whatever you say, say it calmly
 3
 You should be confident that your importance is not less than any other person
 aap jo bhi hai, jaise bhi hai, apane-aap main anuthe hai
 You are entitled to love, who understands your importance
 4
 Social media can help you a lot in this work
 aap chahen to kaaman frends se madad or raay le sakate hai
 5
 agar aapako apane puraane partner kaa saath acha nahin lagata ho, to aap apane vichaaron par sthir rahen
 Remove the matter of connecting the relationship by beating your mind
 6
 In the event of a breakup, it is better to think of something positive than running into emotions
 kuch or nahin, to kam se kam apana vajah hi 5-7 kilogram kam karne kaa upaay karen, jo ki aap bahut dinon se soch rahe the
 Whatever profession you are in, develop some more skills in it, so that it opens the way to progress
 sharaab yaa cigarette pine se koi phayda to nahin, ulte nuksaan hi he
 7
 gujri hui jindagi se sabak jarur len, phir aage ke safar main uskaa istemaal jarur karen
 This will help you in finding the partner who is perfect for you
 tab aapako puraane partner kii tulana main kahin behatar saathi mil sakegaa

 saal 2001 main aaj ke hi din sansad par hamale ko aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad ke aatankiyon ne anjaam diya tha
 And the mastermind of this attack was Afzal Guru
 hamale main surakshakarmiyon ne 5 aatanki maar giraae gaye
 At the same time, 9 people lost their lives and many were injured
 hamale ke baad 15 disambar 2001 ko dilli police ne aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ke sadsy afjal guru ko jammu-kashmir se pakadaa
 At the same time, apart from SAR Geelani of Zakir Hussain College of Delhi University, two other Afsan Guru and her husband Shaukat Hussain Guru were caught
 maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi trial court ne 18 disambar 2002 ko afjal guru, shaukat hasan or gilaani ko maut kii sajaa dene kaa farmaan sunaaya or afasaan guru ko bari kar diya gaya
 On 29 October 2003, Gilani was acquitted of the Delhi High Court in the hanging given 12 years after the attack
 phir maamla supreme court pahunchaa or 4 agast 2005 ko shaukat hasan kii sajaa-e maut ko badalakar 10 saal sashram karawas kar diya gaya
 Afzal Guru's punishment-a-death was unfit and then the day came when Afzal Guru was hanged
 sansad hamale ke 12 saal baad 9 farvari 2013 ko doshi afjal guru ko suuli par chadhaaya gaya
 However, till the last moment, terrorist Afzal Guru felt that his death sentence would be changed
 use yahi ummid thi kii uski faansee kii sajaa ko umrakaid main tabdeel kar di jaaegi, lekin aisa hua nahin
 On 8 February, Afzal Guru was told that he would be hanged the next day at 8 am and after hearing this he realized that these were the last moments of his life
 koun tha afjal guru, kaise bana aatankwaadi?afjal guru jaish-e-mohammad kaa aatankwaadi or bhartiya sansad bhawan par hamale kaa mastmind tha
 Apart from this, Afzal Guru was a resident of Sopore in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir and was studying MBBS as well as preparing for IAS examination
 baad main jammu-kashmir libration front kaa sadsy bana or vahiin se usne aatanki training lee
 During this time, Afzal met his man named Tariq, who encouraged him for jihad
 uske baad tarik ne hi use pakistan ke gajiabad main anya aatankiyon se milwaaya
 There, Afzal was given training for the Fidein attack
 afjal guru jammu-kashmir kaa tha, isliye use lagata rahaa ki use faansee kii sajaa nahin di jaaegi, kyonki isse kashmir ugr ho jayega
 However, on 3 February 2013, President Pranab Mukherjee turned down the mercy petition of Afzal Guru and was crucified on 9 February 2013
 iske baad afjal guru kaa shav tihaad main hi dafna diya gaya

 During the fight, it will often echo in your mind that this battle does not reduce the depth of your relationship
 to ghabaraaen nahin, har ladaai kaa anjaam bura nahin hota
 But yes, if you leave the rift after wrangling, it is not good for the future of your relationship
 jaruri he ki ladaai ke baad aage badhane se pehle peeche ke bure anubhavon ko mitaakar hi chalem
 By doing this, the dispute between you two will go on strengthening the relationship instead of pain and cracks

 gujarat hai court ke vakilayatin ojane gujarat hai court ke jaj emr shah par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 He has also written a letter to Chief Justice of India JS Khehar regarding this
 vakil yatin oja ne nyaayadhish emr shah par aarope lagaaya ki unhone notebandi ke dauraan rajya sarkaar kii madad se 1 karod ke kaledhan ko nai karency main tabdeel kiya
 Yatin Oja is also known as Amit Shah's mentor
 bijepi se kinare kiye jane ke baad yatin oja ne pehle congress or phir aap party join kar lee thi
 It is alleged that the allegations are very serious in the beginning of the letter
 iske saath hi unhone likhaa he ki agar unke aarope galat sabit hue to vah iske liye koi bhi parinaam bhugatne ke liye taiyaar hai
 He has demanded the Chief Justice to get the case fair and detailed to prove the charge
 aarope kii jaankaree dete hue oja ne likhaa he ki jaj shah ahmedabad main july-agast 2016 tak ek bangale ke maalik the
 However, after the land was allotted to Shah and other judges of the High Court near the High Court, Shah sold the bungalow for 1 crore
 shah ne aarope lagaaya he ki vah rakam cash main uplabdh karwaai gai thi or iske bare main shah ne koi jaankaree nahin di he
 During such note, the judge had this amount in the notes of 500 and thousand rupees only, with the help of the state government, these notes were converted into new currency
 isamen ek mantri or ek party ke netaa ne unki madad kii
 Oja has written that if the Chief Justice gets an impartial judge to investigate the matter, then everything will be proved to me
 collegium kaa bhi zikroja ne apane letters main jajon kii niyukti ke liye banane vaale collegium system ke bare main bhi tippanee kii
 Oja has written in the letter referring to the judges KM Joseph and Jayant Patel that now the collegium is kneeling before the central government
 haalanki 28 agast main banane vaale collegium main shaamil hone vaale jajon madan bi lokur, jasti chelmeshwar or courian joseph dwaara is system ko bachaane ke prayaas kiye jane kii ummid jataai
 It has not been the first time that disputes with controversies have happened when Yatin Oja has made such serious allegations
 isse pehle yatin oja ne dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko likhe patr main daawa kiya tha ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or ovaisi aapas main mili hue hai
 The Supreme Court had directed lawyer Yatin Oja to seek unconditional apology for making objectionable comments against two judges of the Gujarat High Court
 supreme court ke purv mukhya nyaayadhish tii es thakur ne oja ko fatkaar lagaate hue kaha tha ki wo ek halafanama daayar kar maafee maangen or usamen ye bhi likhen ki wo ab is tarah ke bayaan donon jajon ke khilaaf nahin de denge
 Ojha had said that Gujarat High Court judges MR Shah and KS Jhaveri work not at the behest of the Constitution, but at the behest of 7 Race Course Road and 11 Ashoka Road
 is bayaan kii vajah se oja ke khilaaf gujarat hai court main court kii avmaananaa kii karrwai shuru hui thi
 Yatin Oja had applied to the Supreme Court to stop this action
 saath hi oja ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya tha ki bijepi ke kareebi kuch kaarobaariyon ko notebandi kii jaankaree pehle se thi
 There is political uncertainty in Jharkhand with the bjp's decision to withdraw support from the jmm-led government and the Congress' 'wait and see' policy
 jharkhand ko lekar party kii ranneeti ke bare main puche jane par congress ke ek sheersh netaa ne kaha, ‘philhal ham is masale main khud ko shaamil nahin kar rahe hai
 Nobody has talked to us nor are we taking any initiative
 ’ bhaajapa netaa sushamaa swaraj ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki party ke vidhayak rajyapal em o ech faruk se milakar shibu sorain sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi ke faisle se unhen avgat karaayenge
 Meanwhile, the top Congress leader denied that Soren had planned to vote in favor of the government in the Lok Sabha during the cut motion
 yah poochne par ki kya sorain ne galati se mat daal diya yaa phir congress ne unase is bare main baat kii thi, unhone kaha, ‘hamen khud aashcharya he ki aisa kaise ho gaya
 Also said that only Soren can tell how everything happened
 is netaa ne raajnneetik halkon main chal rahi is bahes ko bhi khaarij kar diya ki sorain ko kendra main mantri banane or jharkhand main congress-jhamumo-jeviem kii gathbandhan sarkaar banane kii koi koshish ho rahi he
 He said, 'no question arises
 yah niraadhaar he
 There is no agreement between the Congress and the JMM
 ’ congress netaa ne kaha ki party intjaar karo or dekho kii niti apana rahi he or vah philhal jaldbaaji main koi kadam nahin uthaanaa chaahati
 Meanwhile, senior Congress leader and Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai from Jharkhand has ruled out the possibility of offering the post of Chief Minister to anyone in the state
 unhone sansad parisar main samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ham jharkhand main kisi ko bhi mukhyamantri pad kii peshkash nahin karenge
 At the moment, we are adopting a wait and see policy
 ’udhar sorain ne bhaajapa ke varisht netaaon laalkrishna adwani, sushamaa swaraj or party adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko patr likhakar loksabhaa main rajg ke katautee prastaav ke khilaaf matdaan karne ke liye maafee maangi he
 He said this happened due to poor health and the BJP should reconsider its decision to withdraw support
 bhaajapa par lagata he sorain kii is apil kaa koi asar nahin hua he
 Sushma said, 'we are not satisfied with this letter and our decision to withdraw support remains
 ’unhone in afvaahon ko bhi nakaara ki ki bhaajapa mukhyamantri pad par apane kisi netaa ko bithaane or sorain ke putr hemanth ko up mukhyamantri pad kii peshkash ke saath vahaan sarkaar banane kii koshish kar rahi he
 On Soren's action, Jharkhand Deputy Chief Minister and BJP state unit chief Raghuveer Das said in Ranchi, "the fault lies with the man and he (soren) has accepted the mistake
 ’ is bich lojpa ke mahasachiv shamile nabi ne maang kii he ki jharkhand main tatkaal raashtrapati shashan lagu kiya jaae kyonki koi bhi raajnneetik dal yaa gathjod sarkaar banane kii sthiti main nahin he

 The BJP is not taking the name of dissent on the ticketing of councilors
 parshad apni kursi bachaane ke liye party ke aalaa netaaon ke dar par guhaar laga rahe hai or faisle ko aatmghaatee bataa rahe hai
 But the expectation is from the attitude of the seven mps of Delhi
 bijepi ke dedh sau se zyada parshad tikat katane se pareshaan hai
 More than a hundred of them are openly opposing ticketing and have even gone to the leaders of the party and launched a campaign to withdraw the decision
 pichley teen din main sau parshad ek-ek kar aalaa netaaon or saansadon ke dar par dastak de chuke hai
 Although at some places, senior party leaders have reprimanded the councilors for this campaign, the mobilization of the councilors seems to be affecting the mps
 parshadon ne ekajute hokar jo daleelentictabandike virodh main di hai, unka asar bhi dikhne laga he
 Councilors have tried to go to the leaders' house and show that the message of cutting the ticket of all the councilors will go wrong and the party's image in the public will be corrupt
 vahiin bina kisi kaaran tikat kaatane se ward ke kaaryakartaaon main galat sandesh jayega or samarthakon kaa manobal kam hoga
 With these arguments, the councilors also met the mps
 bhale hi saansadon ne in parshadon ko party kaa faisla maanane kii naseehat di ho
 But the mps have definitely realized that the mobilization of the councilors due to ticketing can be overshadowed by the party in the elections to be held within a month
 isiilie kuch saansad parshadon kii maang ke aage pighalate nazar bhi aa rahe hai
 According to Pravesh Verma of West Delhi, the resentment of the councilors is justified and it is also natural for them to be hurt by the ticket being cut
 haalanki unhone kaha ki ye faisla party ne soch samajhakar liya he or parshadon ko aage aane vaale chunaavon main vidhansabha ke tikat ke liye bhi yogya mana jayega

 xxrep 8 ? As we fall back into our routine life, it is important to remember that any conversation about same-sex marriage is healthy (whether you agree with the views of others or not
 ) To open up someone's mind about something they know nothing about takes time and patience
 Anger and frustration is never the way to build awareness
 Give those uninformed a chance to learn and realize that LOVE is more powerful than any race, religion, gender, or preference
 Keep the conversation open

 i have worked very hard in my life
 apni mehnat se maine jindagi main ek mukaam hasil kiya he
 i feel very sad to say that whenever someone misbehaved with me did not support me, but i had no choice but to take strict steps this time
 kai baar ham itane sharminda or apamaanit ho jate hai ki khud ko bevakoof banaate hai, jo kuch bhi hua wo kisi ne nahin dekha
 People often start looking around as if they are not there or we are not there
 log bas itnaa hi sharminda hote hai ki apni nazren chura len lekin itnaa sharminda nahin hote ki maamle main hastkshep karen
 Ironically, after whatever happened to me in Wankhede, people are creating stories about my character but no one is talking about the truth
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki vahaan maujuud chashmadid sach bolenge or police apana kaam teji se va nishpakshta se karegi
 No woman would want to get caught in this kind of controversy, which i am currently going through

 maine itane saalon main unke (ness wadiya) khilaaf media main kuch nahin kaha lekin ab mere paas koi vikalp nahin bachaa tha
 i humbly request the media and my supporters that they focus on what happened in Wankhede and the incident

 It is not easy for me either and my aim is not to hurt anyone but to protect myself and take a stand for myself

 Of course, Mohinder Amarnath did not score as many runs as Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Saurabh Ganguly, but the biggies do not rate him any less than these players
 amarnath ko pyaar se ‘jimi’ pukaara jaataa he
 Today he is celebrating his 64th birthday
 amarnath kis str ke khilaadi the uskaa andaja isi baat se lag jaataa he ki sunil gavaskar, imran khan, vivian richards, david boon, maaikel holding, mailcome marshall or kapil dev jaise bade diggaj kabhi inaki tarif karte thake nahin
 Mohinder Amarnath, known as 'master of Come Back' in his life, started his career as a fast bowling all-rounder in 1969 against Australia
 lekin ek match ke baad hi unhen team se baahar kar diya gaya, or iske baad rashtriya team main vaapasi karne ke liye unhen 6 saal se zyada kaa intjaar karnaa padaa
 India made history by winning the World Cup under the captaincy of Kapil Dev in 1983
 lekin us itihaas ko banane main mohinder amarnath ne sabase bada kirdaar nibhaayaa
 In the semi-final against England, Amarnath took crucial wickets of David Gavar and Mike Gating with just 27 runs
 iske baad ballebaaji karne utre amarnath ne shandaar 46 ranon kii pari khelkar bharat ko final main pahunchaa diya
 Amarnath was the 'man of the Match'
 final main bharat kaa saamana us vakt kii sabase khatarnaak team westeindies ke saath tha
 The West Indies won the toss and gave India a chance to bat, but the Indian team collapsed for just 183 runs in front of the sunken balls of Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding, Andy Roberts and Joel Garner
 caribbian gendbaajon kii aag ugalati gendon ke saamne jahaan bhartiya ballebajo ke liye krij main khadaa rahanaa mushkil ho rahaa tha, vahiin gajab kaa sangharsh pesh karte hue amarnath ne 80 gendon par 26 ran banaae
 Even after bowling, Amarnath's performance was amazing and he took 3 precious wickets for just 12 runs, and India became the world champion
 amarnath na sirf ‘main of da match’ chune gaye balki unhen ‘main of da siries’ ke khitaab se bhi nawaja gaya
 The best season for Amarnath was 1982-83, when he was returning to the team after 3 years
 unhone westeindies or pakistan ke khilaaf 11 test maichon main 1182 ran banaae or 5 shatak jade
 This performance becomes special because both Pakistan and West Indies had the best bowlers at that time
 amarnath ne jo lagan or pyaar cricket ke prati dikhaaya wo yuvaaon ke liye ek udhaaharan he

 Maharashtra State Government has taken a clear stand in cases of discrimination against women at the places of prayer
 sarkaar ne aisi roak kaa samarthan karne se manaa kiya he
 During the hearing on the ban on the entry of women in the famous Haji Ali Dargah of Mumbai, the Government of Maharashtra has submitted its case to the Bombay High Court
 rajya sarkaar ne mumbai ke haji ali dargah main mahilaon ke pravesh par lagi paabandi ko asanvaidhanik bataaya he
 Explaining the government's opinion on this ban case, Advocate General Shrihari Ane said that the trust should be disclosed to those who are not part of the custom of Islam
 majaar par jane ko lekar mahilaon par pabandi samvidhan kii dhara 14 main vidit samanta ke adhikaar ke vipareet he
 In support of its stand, the government also presented some examples before the court
 sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki, agar taj mahal main bani mumtaz mahal kii majaar, nagpur ke tazuddin baba darga, ajmersharif kii dargah ho yaa fatehpur kaa saleem chishti dargah, yahaan par mahilaon ke pravesh par koi bhedbhaav nahin he
 In such a situation, the ban on Haji Ali cannot be supported
 is maamle par sunwaayee ke dauraan sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha ki, sabarimala or shani shinganapur main jari paabandi kii tulana haji ali dargah kii paabandi se nahin ho sakati
 Because, the banning of dargah has come into force recently

 In 2012, the Indian Muslim Women's Movement had asked the then congress-ncp government to interfere with discrimination at the Dargah
 lekin unki baat ansuni kar di gai
 The hearing of the case was completed in the High Court on Tuesday
 ab antim faisle kaa intjaar he
 The state government has termed the ban on the entry of women into the Haji Ali Dargah of Mumbai as unconstitutional
 sarkaar kii taraf se is paabandi ke maamle par raay spasht karte hue mahadhivaktaa srihari ane ne kaha, jo reeti-rivaaj islam kaa hissaa nahin unke anusaran par trust khulaasa karen
 The prohibition on women going to the tomb is contrary to the right to equality as enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution
 apane rukh ke samarthan main sarkaar ne kuch udhaaharan bhi court ke saamne pesh kiye
 It has been said from the government that, if the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal built in Taj Mahal, Tajuddin Baba Darga of Nagpur, Ajmer Sharif Dargah or Salim Chishti Dargah of Fatehpur, there is no discrimination on the entry of women
 aise main haji ali par roak kaa samarthan nahin ho saktaa
 During the hearing on the matter, the government also said that the ban on Sabarimala and Shani Shingnapur cannot be compared to the ban on Haji Ali dargah
 kyonki, dargah kii paabandi haal hi main lagu hui he
 Whereas Shani is an age-old ban in Shinganapur and Sabarimala which is part of the tradition
 gyaat ho ki haji ali dargah kii majaar par 2011 tak mahila jairinon ko be rokatoke pravesh diya jaataa tha
 On the other hand, the Haji Ali Trust, while supporting the ban, has argued in the court that, since Haji Ali is the tomb of a male saint, the entry of women is banned there
 tippaniyan Indian Muslim Women Movement co-founders Zakia Soman and Nur Jahan Safia Niaz have filed a petition in the High Court
 sarkaar ke rukh ko lekar NDTV india se baat karte hue noorjahan ne kaha ki, unka sanghathan is sarkari rukh kaa swaagat karata he
 i wish we had not been able to go to court if we had taken this stance in advance
 bhartiya muslim mahila andolan ne 2012 main tatkaaleen congress-ensipi sarkaar se dargah par hote bhedbhaav main dakhal dene kii baat kahi thi
 But his point was unheard
 mangalvaar ko hoicourt main is maamle kii sunwaayee puri hui
 Now waiting for the final verdict

 is maamle par sunwaayee ke dauraan sarkaar ne yah bhi kaha ki, sabarimala or shani shinganapur main jari paabandi kii tulana haji ali dargah kii paabandi se nahin ho sakati
 Because, the banning of dargah has come into force recently
 jabaki shani shinganapur or sabarimala main varshon puraani paabandi he jo parampara kaa hissaa he

 isi kadi main shuukravaar ko congress netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ne mandsaur main road sho kiya
 During this roadshow, something happened that Jyotiraditya Scindia came into the limelight

 unhone kaha ki is dauraan jo bhi unhen fal kii maala, bhindi kii maala , neembu-mirch kii maala detaa he vah use pahan lete hai
 bjp's sarcasm; Scindia's behavior on behalf of BJP has been termed as fear of Shivraj Singh
 mandsaur ke bijepi vidhayak yashpal singh sisodiya ne kataaksh karte hue kaha he ki congress dari hui he
 Therefore Scindia has to resort to sorcery
 unhone kaha ki shuruyaat main congressi keval neembu mirch kii maala pahan rahe hai, aage shivaraj kaa jaadu chalegaa to inako jhaad-phoonk bhi karwaani padegi

 ek sho aisa ban saktaa he jo sirf saas dekhe
 Actor Nakula, who created the web series i Don't Watch TV, said that i had been thinking of making my own content for a long time

 jan dhan yojana main vipaksh ko madad karnaa chahie tha, lekin unhone aisa nahin kiya
 The Mumbai BJP president said that the government's job is not to generate employment
 mudra yojana main sarkaar ne 4 karod se zyada yuvaaon ko rojgaar diya he
