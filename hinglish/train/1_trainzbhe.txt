 Rohit appeared committed to take advantage of the opportunity and in the meantime luck also supported him
 jab vah 12 ran par the tab petersan ne unka aasaan kaich choda
 Gautam Gambhir (10) however returned unfortunately to the pavilion
 tim bresanan kii jis gend par unhen wicket ke peeche out diya gaya tha vah unke balle ko chhukar nahin gayi thi
 Meanwhile, Rohit completed 2000 runs in ODI cricket
 unhone root kii gend par ek ran lekar apana 13waan ardhashatak puraa karne ke baad adhik teji dikhaayi
 He hit a consecutive six and four off Treadwell's ball
 vah majbootee ke saath apane tisare shatak kii taraf bad rahe the lekin steven fin ne unhen elbeadblyoo out karke england kii ummid jagaayi
 Dhoni and Raina again assumed responsibility
 is bich kuch drama bhi dekhne ko mila
 England did not get Raina's wicket due to Finn's mistake if Dhoni avoided being stumped
 raina ne slip main kaich de diya tha
 Finn, however, had dropped the bowling edge and umpire Steven Davis gave it a 'dead ball'
 raina ne iskaa phayda uthaaya tathaa bresanan kii gend duusari slip se chaar ran ke liye bhejkar 27waan or lagaataar teesraa ardhashatak puraa kiya or isi gendbaaj ke agle over main do chauke lagaaye

 cook ko jis gend par elbeadblyoo out diya gaya vah leg stump ke baahar pich karaayi gayi thi
 Cook hit 13 fours in his 106-ball innings
 eon morgan (03) or samit patel (01) bhi jaldi pavilion laut gayi jisase score ek wicket par 132 ran se chaar wicket par 142 ran ho gaya
 England's situation would have worsened if Kohli had not missed the easy catch of Root in the slip off Ishant's ball
 tab root ne khaataa bhi nahin kholaa tha
 Peterson and Root scored fast in the death overs
 unhone aswin ke baad ishanth ko nishane par rakhaa
 Meanwhile, Pietersen completed his 24th half-century but he was bowled by the same bowler's yorker after hitting a six over Ishant

 yah bangala nitish kumaar sarkaar main samaaj kalyaan vibhaag kii mantri kumari manju verma ko aavantit he
 Kumari Manju Verma resigned from her post last evening as her husband was accused of having links with Brijesh Thakur, the main accused in the Muzaffarpur case
 manju verma kaa istipha to ho gaya he magar phir bhi unka yah bangala charchaa kaa vishay bana hua he
 Why does the question arise? The answer is also very interesting
 darasal, pichley kuch saalon main strand road kaa bangala number 6 manahoosiyat kaa pratik ban chukaa he
 Any minister who has come to stay in this bungalow in the last few years has not completed his term
 baat yahaan par pichley 3 mantriyon kii ho rahi he jo is ghar main rahete the magar unhone mantri rahete hue apana kaarykaal puraa nahin kiya
 The special thing is that these three leaders come from the Kushwaha caste
 sabase pehle baat karte hai jadyu netaa or utpaada vibhaag ke mantri avadhesh kushvaha kii jo 2010 main mantri bane or unhen yah bangala aavantit hua magar oktober 2015 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan un par ghoose lene kaa aarope laga
 The video of Avadhesh Kushwaha taking money went viral after which Nitish Kumar got his resignation
 avadhesh kushvaha ko apane kaarykaal samaapt hone se 2 maheene pehle hi apane pad se istipha dena padaa
 The Mahagathbandhan won the 2015 assembly elections and Alok Mehta became the Minister for Cooperation from RJD quota and was allotted this bungalow
 alok mehta keval 18 maheene hi mantri rah paae kyonki pichley saal nitish kumaar ne mahagathbandhan se alag hokar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar bana lee or alok mehta is bangale main rahete hue apana kaarykaal puraa nahin kar sake
 Alok Mehta also belongs to the Kushwaha caste
 pichley saal pradesh main jadyu-bhajpaaki sarkaar banane ke baad kumari manju verma nitish cabinet main iklauti mantri baniin or unhen samaaj kalyaan vibhaag kaa jimmaa mila
 While minister, Manju Verma was also allotted Strand Road bungalow number 6 but everyone knows what happened to his fate
 manju verma bhi keval 1 saal tak mantri rah pain or is bangale main rahete hue unhone bhi apana kaarykaal puraa nahin kiya

 mukundwari thane ke varisht nireekshak nath jadhav ne news agency ko bataaya ki ki pramod jaisingh hore ne fasebuk or whatsap par likhaa tha ki vah aarakshan kii maang ke samarthan main apni jaan de degaa
 He allegedly jumped in front of a moving train in Mukundwadi area here yesterday (sunday) night
 ek police adhikari ke anusaar, jaisingh ne fasebuk par likhaa tha, 'aaj ek maratha chhodkar ja rahaa he
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But do something for Maratha reservation
 'maharashtra lok seva ayog keepariksha kii taiyaari main jutejaisingh ne ek anya sandesh main likhaa tha, 'maratha aarakshan ek jaan legaa
 'many of his friends requested him not to do so but he did not listen to anyone
 jaisingh kaa shav somvaar subah rail patari par mila
 Hearing the news of his suicide, a large number of people gathered outside his house
 uske parijan ne kaha ki ve tab tak arthi nahin uthaaenge jab tak rajya sarkaar aarakshan ke mudde par antim nirnay nahin le leti
 The Maratha community in Maharashtra is agitating for the demand for reservation
 jadhav ke mutabik, jaisinghmukundwari main ek dukanchalaata tha or uski patni gramsevika tha
 Meanwhile, pro-reservation activists blocked the Jalna Road to pressurize their demands
 saath ke dashak main kolkata ke kisi kishoravay ladke kii tarah meri bhi ruchi sidhi-saadi thi
 For example, poetry, sex, spirituality and a strong desire to change the world, etc
 par kya itani hi? shaayad nahin
 That is why i came out of the best college like Presidency in the days of great upheaval of the Naxalbari movement and completed my first book of poems at the age of 17
 khushkismati kahie ki meri mulaakaat anokhe insaan or riters workshop ke sansthaapak pi
 Done with red
 ve professor, kavi, kallingrapher or mahabharat ke samgr anuvadak ke rup main jane jate the
 He printed my book of poems and continued to print all my books for the next few years
 anuwaad kii kala maine unheen se sikhi, jo baad main mere liye nasha ban gai
 Whenever i got free time from writing, i sat down to translate the work of others
 meri apni kavitaaon kaa bhi anuwaad hua
 Some translations are good
 shakti chatopadhyaay kaa anuwaad to meri mul kavita se bhi acha he
 Not surprising because he himself is a great poet
 kuch anuwaad bhula dene laayak hai
 But it does not matter
 jivan kii tarah log acchhee kavitaayen hi yaad rakhte hai
 Bad poems are forgotten and surprisingly forgiven (tagore's horrifying translation of his poems is a classic example of this)
 italy main anuvadak ko dagaabaaz kaha jaataa he
 Or say that the translation is like a woman who is as beautiful as she is unfaithful
 so, maine apni pasandida bangla or urdu kavitaaon or shaayari kaa puri bevafaayee se khub anuwaad kiya
 Also tried his hand at ancient Sanskrit love poems
 usee daur main mujhase umr or samajhadaari donon main bade mere ek dost, sanskrit ke vidwaan, mujhe ek ore le gaye or kehane lage ki mujhe ishopanishad ke anuwaad kii koshish kerani chahie
 He promised to help me in this
 is tarah ek nai shuruyaat hui
 Shastriji liked it when my first draft was ready
 par ve mere tareeke se sahamat na the
 He complained that you appear very much in this
 meraa jawaab tha ki agar mujhe apni bhaawanaaon ke anuroop punarrachana kii ijaajat na ho to main kisalie clasix kii khaak chhaanuun? vah 1977 kaa daur tha or meri gustaakhee barkaraar thi
 The professor liked that and wanted to print it
 maine kaha nahin, abhi main is par or kaam karuunga
 Years passed
 ishopanishad meri mej par padaa rahaa
 Meanwhile, i did some other translation
 bangladesh kaa yuddh hua
 i translated the poets of war, who were willing to sacrifice their lives
 felics topolski ne chitrankan kiya or landan main rahane vaale srilankai kavi tambeemuttu ne use chapa
 She proved to be a bestseller and collected funds for the war effort (40 years later Sheikh Hasina Sarkar awarded me for her last year)
 ishopanishad meri mej par usee tarah padaa rahaa
 No, it would not be correct to say
 main usamen samay-samay par waapas utarataa par har baar vah badla hua miltaa
 In an almost magical way, something completely different would seem
 par main use abhi chhapavane ko taiyaar na tha
 After all, Mahatma (gandhi) has said that if all the scriptures written till now are destroyed and the Isophanishad is saved then there will be no shortage of anything in the world
 us tathvik chetana ko duusari bhashaa main abhivyakt karne ke vichaar ne hi daraa diya
 Still, it was not acceptable to back down from the challenge
 jab bhi main draft padhata (yah chota upanishad he or ise baar-baar padhuya aasaan he), mujhe lagata, main kuch alag tarah se kar rahaa hum
 Every time i read, new thoughts flashed in my mind
 unheen vaakyon ko nae sire se sajaane par kuch nayaa ban jaataa tha
 i was amazed: Is this why the repeated return to ancient intellectualism leads us to think of new ideas that have changed with our change over the years? To be fair, i was not thinking anything
 main bas itnaa jaanata tha ki ishopanishad vicitra paheli kii tarah he, jo khud-ba-khud kai tarah ke samaadhaan bataati he, lekin harek ekadam bhinn hai
 It's up to you at what point of life you see it
 in varshon main main shahar, ghar, naukari, premicaayen badalata rahaa or is prakriya main kai dost, diariyaan, adhuri pandulipiyaan peeche chhot gayi par yah upanishad na chuta
 Till last year, my publisher friend Naveen Kishore suggested that 2014 could be a good year to finish it
 ishopanishad main sabase zyada yah baat aakarshith karti he ki usamen dur-dur tak koi dharmik baat nahin he
 Every word, every thought you want can be associated with yourself
 yah surya namaskara kii tarah he
 Some people may call it Hindu scripture but it is as much Hindu scripture as breathing the air of India or taking a dip in the Ganges
 mere liye yah jivan ke google nakshe sareekha he
 What happened to poetry, sex, spirituality and the desire to change the world? They all still stand today
 shaayad ab us kram main nahin

 Also, five acres of land should not be taken because another mosque cannot be built in lieu of mosque
 masjid hameshaa ke liye hoti he
 Sunni Waqf Board member and Samajwadi Party MLA Abrar Ahmed believes that there is no benefit in going to the review because the Supreme Court has given a verdict which was our thing and it was given to another
 ab to rivyuu main janaa bevakoof banane jaisaa he
 He said that one should not go to the review as there is no use
 bataa den ki ol india muslim personal lau board (AIMPLB) ne ram janmabhumi-babari masjid maamle main supreme court ke faisle par rivyuu pitishan daakhil karne kaa elaan kiya he

 Lok Sabha Speaker GS Dhillon was impeached against the then Judge JC Shah in May 1970 after a campaign by former government official OP Gupta

 jisamen paradivaala par aarakshan ke khilaaf 'asanvaidhanik' tippanee karne kaa aarope tha
 Seeing the possibility of impeachment motion, Justice Pardiwala removed his remarks against reservation from the record
 unhone patidaar netaa hardik patel se jude ek cese main aarakshan ke khilaaf kathith tippanee kii thi
 Because of this, impeachment was being brought against him
 lekin baad main paradivaala ke khilaaf mahabhiyog ke notice par aage kii kaarywahi nahin ho saki
 Progress in impeachment proceedings against judges in Parliament was first made in 1993 when Supreme Court judge v Ramaswamy faced corruption charges following an inquiry commission report
 varisht vakil or congress ke rajyasabha sadsy kapil sibbal ne us vakt loksabhaa main ramasvami kaa joardaar bachaav kiya tha
 Significantly, Sibal is playing a leading role in the campaign to impeach CJI Mishra
 pi ve narsingh raav sarkaar ke dauraan laayaa gaya mahabhiyog prastaav loksabhaa main vifal ho gaya tha, kyonki use samvidhan ke anuchhed 124 (4) ke tahat jaruri sadan ke do-tihaai sadasyon kaa samarthan praapt nahin ho paaya tha
 In addition to Justice Ramaswamy, the impeachment motion was brought against Calcutta High Court Judge Soumitra Sen in 2011
 un par ek nyaayadhish ke rup main vittiya gaban or galat tathyon ko pesh karne ke aarope the
 The motion against him was passed in the Rajya Sabha and when Sen, who defended himself in the Rajya Sabha, realized the outcome, he resigned before the motion was discussed in the Lok Sabha
 sikkim ucch nyaayalay ke tatkalinmukhya nyaayadhish nyaayamurti pidi dinakaranne 2011 main mahabhiyog kii kaarywahi shuru hone se pehle hi istipha de diya tha

 The inquiry was conducted by Ansari after accepting a motion given by 58 members of the Rajya Sabha to impeach Justice SK Gangale
 sena pramukh general ve ke singh kaa maananaa he ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne unki umr se jude vivaad ko kargar tareeke se band nahin kiya he
 However, he ruled out the possibility of his resignation
 umr vivaad par raksha mantralay ke saath kanoonee ladaai main general singh ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 He said, 'it would be dishonest to say that i was not pressured to resign
 yahaan tak ki mere kareebi salaahkaar bhi media kii vyakhya se prabhavit the or haa, main behad niraash tha ki ucchtam nyaayalay ne is mudde ko kargar tareeke se band nahin kiya
 'he said,' Being the Chief of Army Staff, i have a responsibility to the Army and its personnel and i have to see the unfinished tasks that i have set for myself
 main tab tak nahin chhod saktaa jab tak ki maine jo shuru kiya he use puraa na kar luun
 Organizational interests are supreme
 ’general singh ne kaha ki anek tippaneekar ise asainya-sainya sambandhon main tanaav ke clasik maamle ke taur par dekh rahe the or unhone unke istife kii bhavishyavaanee karne ke liye general ke es thimaiya ke apurna istife se tulana kii
 Asked about the Supreme Court's speculation about his resignation for not retaining his case, he said, "but i see age as something that i and the army have to resolve and once given legal system We will do it when we go
 ’general singh ne kaha ki sheersh adaalat ke aadesh ne mukhya mudde kaa niraakaran kiye bina adhik bhram paidaa kiya he
 She talks of dividing the statutory complaint into two parts, which include the decision making process on the one hand and its deliberation on the other
 general singh ne kaha, ‘raksha mantralay ne kaha ki chunki unhone mere janm kaa varsh 1950 tay karne kaa faisla kiya he isliye mujhe ise har haal main sweekaar karnaa he
 This is against the principle of natural justice
 ’yah puche jane par ki yah dharna bani ki vah kanoonee ladaai haar gaye hai or ucchtam nyaayalay ne unke khilaaf vyavastha di he to unhone kaha ki yah vicitra sthiti thi
 When the Supreme Court was hearing the case, the hearing was being interpreted minute by minute in the media
 tivi par braking news or akhabaaron ne agle din apni hedline main apana faisla diya jisamen ghoshit kiya gaya ki ‘general ladaai haar gaye hai
 General Singh said that when the order came on 15 February, the media did not report it and not everyone paid attention to its intent
 unhone kaha, ‘yah ahaanikaarak aadesh he jo ricard ke aadhaar par janmatithi ko manyata dene kii baat sakasham praadhikaar par chodta he
 The media was reporting an exaggerated comment
 ’yah puche jane par ki adaalat se unke yachika waapas lene ke faisle se dharna bani ki adaalat ne jo kuch bhi kaha usase vah santusht hai to isapar general singh ne kaha ki unki vaidhanik shikaayat ke gat 30 disambar ko raksha mantralay dwaara khaarij kiye jane ke baad unhone adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha
 On February 3, the court questioned the decision-making process, which led to the rejection and opined that it was against the principles of natural justice
 gat 10 farvari ko atorni general ne vaidhanik shikaayat ke khilaaf raksha mantralay ke aadesh ko waapas ko le liya or maun rup se sweekaar kiya ki vaastavik janmatithi 1951 thi or mantralay sirf siddhant ke taur par virodh kar rahaa he
 General Singh said that since there was nothing more to be said in the court and especially the judges had also indicated that the court did not want to fall in the matter of actual date of birth
 unhone kaha, ‘ab, jab tak ki raksha mantralay kii nirnay karne kii prakriya nahin bataai jaati, jisamen meri janmatithi 1950 nirdhaarit karne ke peeche ke tark ko spasht kiya jaae to main kaise ise chunauti de saktaa hum
 So i withdrew my petition and decided to wait for the mod (ministry of Defense) to give a fresh reason
 ’unhone kaha ki mahatvapurn baat yah he ki is baat kii vyavastha kii jaae ki bhavishya main is tarah ke maamalon kii kabhi punrariti nahin ho
 General Singh did not give a direct answer when asked for his opinion of an article written by his daughter pointing out that former Army Chief General JJ Singh had a hand in the birth dispute
 unhone sirf itnaa kaha ki samasya tab bad gai jab raksha mantralay ne aisa kyon kiya ja rahaa he is baat kii padtaal kiye bina ‘is raay kaa samarthan karnaa chunaa
 When asked if you are saying that the 2006 decision (made by JJ Singh) was illegal, General Singh said, "it has its own implications
" agar main kahata hum ki main ise chunauti nahin detaa hum, ise lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki nyaayalay kaa aadesh janm kii do alag-alag tarikhon kii vaidhata par kuch bhi nahin kahata
 When asked if it seemed that you would appear as a person standing against the establishment, he said, "as the head of the Indian Army, i cannot escape public opinion and i am aware that i am defending It was wrong to carry the fight to the ministry

 ’modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit karne kii ho rahi maang ke sandarbh main ansaari ne kaha, ‘modi ne vikaas ke jariye khud ko ek lokapriy netaa ke taur par sabit kiya he
 i believe that whoever the party nominates as the Prime Ministerial candidate will be fully capable of leading the country
 ’ansaari ne bijepi kii sampradayikta kii kathith chhavi ke bare main puche jane par kaha, ‘hamaari vichaardhaara sabko saath lekar chalane kii he
 By the way, secularism cannot be the contract of any single party
 ’aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main muslim samudaay ko party se jodne ke bare unhone kaha, ‘ham apane str se prayaas kar rahe hai
 Muslim has understood Congress and other parties
 chijen badali hai or logon kii soch badali he
 We will try to remove the misconceptions that have been spread about our ideology
 ’ Leaders of different parties from Uttarakhand to UP and Goa to Manipur have left the party and joined the BJP
 ye silsilaa emsidi chunaav se pehle dilli main bhi shuru ho chukaa he
 The ride of the leaders of the other party in the bjp's chariot of power is continuously seen
 kahin chunaav se pehle, kahin chunaav ke maukey par, kahin chunaav ke baad bijepi main duusare dalon ke baagi netaaon kaa shaamil hone jari he
 No matter how big that leader is in his party, the leaders now see their future safe in the BJP
 centre main sattadhari bijepi se sabhi netaa kareebi chaahate hai yaa yah kahen kiparty adhyaksh amit shaahaki ranneeti duusari party ke kaddavar netaaon ko bijepi main shaamil karwaane ke peeche kaam kar rahi he
 Whichever leader comes from the other party will bring some vote with him, because he also has a personal vote bank
 jisase party main vot badhenge hi or ek sandesh yah bhi jayega ki, haarane vaali party ko hi aksar netaa chhodte hai
 If he goes to the winner, then with the coming of the leaders, the people will feel that the BJP is the winning party and that is its future too
 haalanki vipaksh is tareeke sebijepimen shaamil karwaane kii ranneeti ko thik naa maanate hue use katghare main khadaa kar rahaa he
 The opposition says that the BJP is inducting such leaders into its party who are already accused of corruption
 baavjood iske bijepi khud ko bhrashtachar mukt party bataati he
 Somewhere in the BJP, there is an acrimony
 bijepi kitni badi-badi baaten karen ki vah bahut badi or majboot party he unki lokapriyata bahut badi he, lekin wo duusari party ke netaaon ke sahare vah chunaav jeetna chaahati he
 The opposition also reminds how BJP in Uttar Pradesh included Congress state president Rita Bahuguna in the party to win the election
 reeta bahuguna ek samay main bijepi kii ghor virdohi raheen hai
 BJP leaders and Rita Bahuguna used to abuse each other a lot
 dashakon tak congress ke vafaadaar maane jane vaale esaem krishna bhi isi fehrist main shaamil hai
 In Karnataka, whose chief minister was BJP, he was accused of corruption
 yahaan tak ki jab unhone videsh mantri rahete duusare desh ke mantri kaa bhaashan pard diya tha
 His mistake was ridiculed by Prime Minister Modi
 ab vahi esaem krishna bijepi parivaar kaa hissaa he
 This strategy of BJP is also seen to be related to the upcoming elections in Karnataka
 uttarakhand ke purv siem vijay bahuguna ke khilaaf bhrashtachar ke aarope lagaate hue bijepi ne mukhyamantri se unke istife kii maang kii thi or joardaar virodh bhi kiya tha
 But the same Vijay Bahuguna was included in the party before the Uttarakhand elections and gave his son a ticket
 isi tarah uttarakhand main congress ke duusare netaa harak singh ravat or purv pradesh congress adhyaksh yashpal arya ko bhi bijepi ne shaamil kar uttarakhand main jeet sunishchit karne kii koshish kii
 When the BJP did not get a majority in the elections in Goa, it formed the government with the help of the leaders of the other party
 itnaa hi nahin congress ke purv mukhyamantri pratap singh rane jo hameshaa bijepi ke nishane par rahete the
 His MLA son got his first MLA resignation
 jisase congress kii sankhya kam ho or sadan main bijepi ko purna bahumat mili
 Later, BJP also adopted Vishwajit Rane as its own
 ab dilli main emsidi chunaav sir par he to shila sarkaar main mantri rahe or party ke pradesh adhyaksh rahe arvinder singh lavali ko amit shah ne bijepi main shaamil kar liya he
 This is the same Lovely whose BJP used to accuse of corruption during his tenure as Education Minister, and continue to target the BJP as the Lovely State President
 ab bijepi kii congress ke duusare pradesh netaaon par bhi najar he
 Even before the Lok Sabha elections, this was the bjp's strategy in which it was successful
 usee prakaar rajyavar ranneeti par bijepi aage badi or use safalataa milti chali gai
 In Bihar, the bjp's strategy was dampened, where the opposition united
 in sabake baavjood amit shah sanghathan or chunavi ranneeti ke maahir hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also patted Amit Shah on the election strategy
 rajyavar isi ranneeti par aage badhate ja rahe hai or unka yahi maananaa he kii party main jo bhi shaamil hoga bijepi parivaar usase badhegaa
 Perhaps on the same lines, the opposition remembers Bihar and in the wake of 2019, the voices of the Maha coalition are echoing again and again in the corridors of politics
 dilli ke sidi cond main ek nayaa mode aa gaya he
 The woman, seen in the CD along with Delhi government's sacked minister Sandeep Kumar, has reached the police station and filed a case against them
 jiske baad maamle main khud ko chautarafa ghirte dekh aaropee vidhayak sandip kumaar ne bahari dilli ke DCP karyaalay main pahunchakar sarender kar diya he
 The woman alleges that Sandeep misbehaved with her by giving her a cold drink
 aap netaa or dilli sarkaar ke purv mantrisandip kumaaraki mushkilen bad gai hai
 The woman seen with him in the CD has come forward and filed a case against Sandeep
 mahila shanivaar ko dilli ke sultanpuri thane pahunchi or vahaan aap netaa sandip ke khilaaf uske saath dushkarm karne kaa maamla darj kara diya
 So far no information was found about the woman appearing in the CD scandal
 lekin ab mahila ke saamne aa jane se sandip kumaar ke liye badi pareshaani khadi ho gai he
 The sword of arrest is now hanging on Sandeep's head
 mana ja rahaa he ki police unhen kabhi bhi giraftaar kar sakati he
 The woman alleges that she went to AAP MLA Sandeep Kumar for the purpose of making ration card
 tabhi sandip kumaar ne mahila ko nashila padaarth milakar cold drink pilaa diya
 Whatever happened to him thereafter is not known
 hosh aane par use sara maamla samaj aayaa
 It is worth mentioning that the Crime Branch of Delhi Police started the investigation of the 'CD scandal' of the dismissed minister Sandeep Kumar of Delhi on Friday
 krime branch ke joint seepi rabindra yadav ne is cese kii jaanch kaa jimmaa ek vishesh team ko diya he
 This team is headed by a DCP
 police sutron kaa kahana he ki kathith sex sidi kaa sach jaanane ke liye barkhaast mantri sandip kumaar ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa ja saktaa he, lekin usase pehle police un sabhi photograph or video kii jaanch karegi, jisamen sandip kumaar mahilaon ke saath antarang palon main najar aa rahe hai
 Forensic investigation of the CD will also be done
 haalanki sandip kumaar sidi main khud ke hone se inkaar kar chuke hai, lekin ab sach kii tah tak jane kaa kaam police ko karnaa he
 The police has to first find out where the person who sent the CD to the media came from, where did the video come from, when was it made, who made it, how did it come out? All these questions are in front of the police
 dilli police ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki shuukravaar ko jaanch kii ruparekha tay kii jaaegi
 Let us tell you that on Thursday, BJP leaders met Police Commissioner Alok Verma and demanded a probe into the CD scandal
 unhone sandip kumaar par mantri pad kaa durupyog karke mahilaon ke yon shoshan kaa shaq jataayaa tha
 The commissioner has handed over the investigation of his complaint to the Crime Branch
 loktantr ek paudhe ke samaan he jisaki lagaataar dekhbhaal kiye jane kii zarurat he
 This was stated by India Today Group editor-in-chief Arun Puri at the India Today Conclave in Delhi on Friday
 is maukey par arun puri ne bataaya ki conklev bhi usee prakriya kaa hissaa he or jab itani hastiyaan ek saath ek manch par hongi to yakeenan 21veen sadi ke bharat ke sapane saakaar bhi honge
 He said that there have been many major changes in the country in the last 11 years
 lekin mujhe yakeen he ki aap bhi maanate honge ki bharat sirf ek desh hi nahin he
 Rather it is the largest democracy in the world where rapid changes are taking place
 ek raashtra ke rup main hamane sabko achraj main daal rakhaa he, jahaan loktantr kaa sabase acha or sabase kharaab pravriti ek saath maujuud he
 For the people of the news world like us, every moment was thrilling
 lekin desh ke liye ye vakt kaisaa rahaa, yah kahana thodaa mushkil he
 He told that India Today Conclave, which has been organized continuously for the last 11 years, has been considering the development of Loktantra in the 21st century and important issues changing with time
 is saal bhi conkalev main loktantr ke badalte ayaamon par prakhyat vaktaaon ke saath charchaa jari rahegi
 This year's theme is: Reinventing Democracy
 loktantr ke liye or loktantr ke andar ke sangharsh ke yug main isse behatar topic or kuch nahin ho saktaa tha
 The painful fight for democracy in the Middle East in the 21st century and the fight for democracy in Arabia warned that the desire for democratic freedom is highly contagious
 loktantr kaa yah sangharsh abhi khatm nahin hua he or romance ke mausam vasant main bhi loktantr main abhi puri aazaadee nahin he
 On this occasion, he also caught the attention of people by taking democracy and also towards the events of the country and abroad
 libya or syria main khun abhi bhi bahaae ja rahe hai or puri duniya dekh rahi he
 Even after dictatorship in Egypt, life in democracy is not better
 yah ek sach he ki loktantr ke liye sangharsh se kahin zyada mushkil he loktantric vyavastha ko kaayam rakhana
 While the struggle for democracy continues in the world, the world's major democracies are going through a period of crisis
 europe main sarkarein ekal mudra ko patan se bachaane or apni arthvyavasthaaon ko punerjeevit ke liye prayasarat hai
 On the other hand, despite changing the government 5 times in the last 4 years in Japan, the country's economic stability is disastrous
 bharat ke loktantr main bhi pareekshan kaa daur jari he
 On the one hand, the politician is the target of the general public
 sarkaron ke aniatik or ruukhe vyavhaar se naaraaz ho jan adaalat sadak utar ai he
 Weak political leadership is damaging the economy
 desh main vikaas dar pichley 10 saal ke sabase nichle staar par pahunch gai he
 Two big economists will express their views on this issue
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke saansadon kii kaaryshaala ke duusare din jab pradhanmantri narendra modi isamen hissaa lene sansad bhawan ke pustkaalay kaksh main pahunche to patrakaron se kaha ki aaj sande ke din to chuttee le lete
 Seeing PM saying so, all the journalists present there had a smile on their faces

 Meanwhile, PM Modi reached there

 Now this video of PM Modi is going viral on social media
 bataa den ki kaaryshaala main bijepi saansadon ko piem modi ne kai mantra bhi die the

 is dauraan piem modi bijepi ke duusare saansadon kii tarah hi peeche kii pankti main baithe bhi najar aae the
 The special thing is that the BJP made the presence of all its mps mandatory for this event
 isse pehle centre sarkaar ne satrahavin loksabhaa kaa satr bhi badha diya tha
 The session was earlier scheduled to end on 26 July but was later extended to 7 August
 ab atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki ise 14 agast tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 BJP mps have been away from their constituencies for the past one and a half months due to this long session
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne bijepi saasandon ko shanivaar or ravivaar ko hone vaali kaaryshaala main kisi bhi keemat par maujuud rahane kaa aadesh diya tha

 What can be the cost of a piece of soil and a handful of grass
 agar ham kahen - 8 lakh rupye se bhi zyaada to aapkaa chaunkna lazimi he
 But the great personality whose memories are attached to it, cannot really be valued
 baat ho rahi he mahatma gandhi kii jinaki nishaniyaan 57 lakh se bhi zyaada qeemat main nilaam kar di gayi
 Fist full of mud and dry grass, cost 8 lakh 19 thousand 104 rupees
 ghaas or mitti kii itani baari qeemat! jaanate hai kyon, kyonki is mitti main sanaa he ek aitihaasik purush kaa koon
 The last breath of a young man is peeping through the shears of grass
 us durbhagyapurna lamahe ko 64 saal guzar chuke hai, jab rashtrapita mahatma gandhi kii goli markar hatya kar di gai thi
 The soil and grass where Bapu's blood fell, could not escape the greedy eyes of the market
 jahaan tak is mitti kaa sawaal he to sab kuch aapke nazariye par nirbhar karata he
 For many people, it can be a minor soil that does not cost more than waste
 lekin kuch logon ke liye ek pavitra nishaani he jo beshkimati he
 Therefore, it is not only difficult to price these things, but it is impossible
 mahatma gandhi ke koon se sani pavitra maati ko usee mulk main nilaam kar diya gaya, jisane bharat ko 200 saalon tak ghulaami kii janziron main jakad rakhaa tha
 Bapu's spectacles and charkha were also bid in this auction

 mulox nilaamee ghar ne jab in chizon kii nilaamee kaa elaan kiya tha, tab iske virodh main kai awaazen buland huin
 a strong demand for cancellation of the auction arose, but those voices were suffocated in the noise of buying and selling and profits
 doctoron or marizon ke bich marpet kii ghatana puure desh main aam baat he lekin somvaar ko patna ames main jo kuch hua use dekhakar mariz bhi hakke-bakke rah gaye
 Actually, the doctors in Patna AIIMS clashed with each other
 baad main ghatana kii jaankaree police ko di gai
 Police reached the spot and registered an FIR and started investigation
 police kii abhi tak kii jaanch main pataa chalaa he ki marpet dental vibhaag ke purv vibhaagadhyaksh doctor shailesh mukul or doctor vinaa ke bich hui
 Doctor Veena was also involved in this incident along with some other doctors
 police philhal is puure maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 It is being told that the main reason for the quarrel is the mail sent by Dr
 Shailesh Mukul in which he made objectionable allegations against his female colleagues
 is aadhaar par unki giraftaar kaa warrant bhi jari hua tha lekin unhen is bich jamaanat mil gai
 This is not the first incident of doctors being beaten or hooliganised in Patna
 kuch samay pehle hipatna main IGIMS main junior doctoron kaa ek gut gundgardee par utar gaya tha
 These junior doctors beat up a policeman
 darasal, ijmes main tainaat sipaahi anil kumaar ne bina helmet ke bike par ja rahe ek junior doctor ko roka to puraa gut marpet karne laga tha
 It can be clearly seen in the photos that some students dragged the policeman after beating him
 bataa den ki patna main bike par peeche baithe vyakti ke liye bhi helmet pahananaa anivaary he
 These people had not only beaten up the police personnel but had also stopped work in the hospital
 isaki vajah se vahaan maujuud marijon ko bhi kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Police had detained some of the accused students in the case and was investigating the case
 police ne is ghatana par kaha thaki jo bhi doshi honge un par kadi karrwai hogi
 One of these four junior doctors was also the son of Vijay Kumar Singh, working at Gandhi Maidan police station
 priyanka gandhi sakriy raajnneeti main kadam rakhte hi congress netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko josh se bhar diya tha
 The rally to be held in Ramabai Maidan, Lucknow on February 10 for Priyanka's political launch has been put on hold
 haalanki, wo videsh se somvaar ko waapas bharat lauti hai or ab badali hui ranneeti ke tahat unki liye uttar pradesh main nae sire plan banaae ja rahe hai
 It is believed that Priyanka's visit to the state can begin with the bathing of Kumbh
 congress ke sutron kii maane to 10 farvari ko prastaavit lakhanu ke ramabai maidan kii raily ko radd kar diya gaya he
 But now under the new plan, it is planned to start Priyanka Gandhi's launching in Uttar Pradesh with the Kumbh Snan of Prayagraj
 iske tahat priyanka gandhi jald hi upi kaa daura karengi
 In this episode, she will first go to Anand Bhawan in Allahabad, after which she can go to take bath in Kumbh
 lakhanu main kar sakati hai baithcopriyanka kumbh main dubkee lagane ke baad lakhanu aaengi
 Here she can hold a big meeting with party leaders and workers at Congress headquarters
 iske saath party mukhyalay main bane nae conference haul kaa udghaatan karengi
 Priyanka's Kumbh Snan is seen as a soft Hindutva card
 iske alaava unke kumbh snaan ko prayagraj kii aasapaas kii kareeb aadha darjan loksabhaa siton ko saadhane kii ranneeti maani ja rahi he
 Adjacent to Prayagraj are the Lok Sabha seats of Allahabad, Phulpur, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Bhadohi and Machilishahar
 bataa den ki 23 janvari ko congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne priyanka gandhi ko party kaa rashtriya mahasachiv banaate hue purvanchal kii jimmedaari saunpi thi
 With this Jyotiraditya Scindia has been given the command of West UP
 priyanka kii raajnneetik entry ko congress kaa master stroke bataaya ja rahaa he
 The Uttar Pradesh Congress had booked Ramabai Maidan for 10 February
 charchaa yah thi ki priyanka kii soobe main laanching ramabai maidan main congress kii ek badi raily ke saath kii jaaegi, lekin ye plan badal chukaa he or ab nae tareeke se plan taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Priyanka's charge of Purvanchal has been given the responsibility of Purvanchal of Uttar Pradesh, part of this Purvanchal includes Awadh and Lower Doab areas
 iske tahate 9 mandal kii 42 loksabhaa siten aati hai
 Eastern Uttar Pradesh is the largest area for Brahmins and this is the reason why it is considered favorable for the Congress
 darasal 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main jab congress ne soobe se 21 siten jeetin thi, usamen 18 siten inhen ilaake kii thi
 After 1984, the Congress had the largest number of seats in Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh main 10 se 12 fisadi ke kareeb brahman matadaata hai
 In 20 to 25 Lok Sabha seats of the state, these voters are directly in the deciding role
 purv main brahman paaramparik congress ke samarthak the lekin mandal andolan ke baad unka jhukaav bijepi kii ore baad brahman matadaataaon ke ek bade hisse kaa jhukaav mayawati kii basapa kii taraf bhi hua tha
 But the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections have gone outright with the BJP
 priyanka gandhi ko sabase pehle isi varg ko apane saath jodne kii ahm jimmedaari hogi
 In this way, if the Brahmin turns to the Congress then the other strategy of the party will be to connect the Muslim and Dalit voters with them
 ye jimmedaari prinyaka gandhi ke kandhon par hogi
 Priyanka Gandhi's plan of Kumbh Snan is part of adding this votebank
 congress is ranneeti par safal rahi to bijepi or sapa-basapa gathbandhan donon ke raajnneetik sameekaran dharashayi ho sakate hai
 The Congressmen of Uttar Pradesh have been facing a political drought for a long time and with the arrival of Priyanka Gandhi, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the grassroots party workers
 soobe main congress kii majboot siton par abhi se poster war ke taur par dikhne bhi laga he, aise main congress ke liye priyanka kaa card kitna safal hota he ye to 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main pataa chal sakegaa

 Former coal secretary PC Parekh worked for three private companies after retirement, one of which is under investigation for acquiring coal blocks
 kendriya jaanch beuro (sibiai) ne hindalco ko koyala khan aavanton maamle main pisi paarekh ke khilaaf exiaar darj kii he
 Parekh, who retired in December 2005, joined Navbharat Power Private Limited as a director on 26 February 2007, as per information available with the Ministry of Company Affairs
 unhone 15 janvari, 2008 ko company chhod di
 Parekh was a director at Visa Power Limited from March 7, 2007 to January 15, 2008 and was associated with Tata Sponge Iron from March 7, 2007
 ek koyala block abantit hone ke baad navabharat ne company kii hissedari 2010 main essar ko bech di or ab vah sibiai jaanch ke daayre main he
 Visa Power also applied for a coal block
 paarekh ne bataaya, ‘company (navabharat power) ko koyala blaak aabantan kaa mere nideshak hone se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 'he said,' i have nothing to do with coal block allocation to these companies
 yadi sibiai ke paas koi soochna he to unhen jaanch kaarywahi karne dijie or aarope patr daakhil karne dijie
 ' in companiyon main unke kaarykaal ke bare main puche jane par paarekh ne kaha, ‘mere kaarykaal ke dauraan aabantan nahin kiye gaye or jis avadhi main main in companiyon ke saath tha, mujhe unke aavedan evam unke aabantan tak ke bare main jaankaree nahin thi
 ' jail main band dramuk saansad kanimojhi ne dilli kii ek adaalat ko bataaya ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh or tatkaaleen vittamantri pi
 Chidambaram was fully aware of the allocation of 2G spectrum licenses and had decided not to auction them along with the then Telecom Minister a Raja
 kanimojhi kii ore se apil karte hue varisht adhivaktaa susheel kumaar ne sibiai ke vishesh nyaayadhish opi saini se kaha, ‘main aapako baithak kaa byora uplabdh kara rahaa hum jisamen pradhanmantri manmohan singh tatkaaleen vitt mantri or doorsanchaar mantri ne faisla kiya ki 2ji spectrum ke licenson kii bikri nilaamee nahin kii jaaegi
 Seeking the discharge of the case, the counsel for the 43-year-old DMK MP said that the CBI case was based on the fact that the accused caused huge losses to the state exchequer by not auctioning licenses for 2G spectrum
 kumaar ne kaha, ‘pradhanmantri tatkaaleen vitt mantri or vartmaan doorsanchaar mantri gavaahon ke rup main yah sabit karne ke liye ‘sahi vyakti’ hai ki koi nuksaan nahin hua
 He said in Parliament that there was no loss
 ’ yah jodate hue ki sibaai kaa maamla jis baat par tikaa he usase kanoonee prakriya nahin banati kumaar ne kaha, ‘yadi nuksaan nahin hua to dhokhadhadi kaa aarope bhi nahin banataa
 The defense counsel also called the CBI and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) assessment of the losses baseless and said that these could not be the basis for prosecuting the accused
 vakil ne kaha, ‘kaig report (sarkari khajaane ko 1
 76 lakh crore loss) was placed before the House on 16 November 2010
 ise sadan ne sweekaar nahin kiya tha
 It is still uncertain whether the House will accept the report
 ’kanimojhi ke vakil ne sibiai ke 30 hajaar 984 karod rupee ke nuksaan ke akalan par bhi sawaal khadey kiye or kaha ki iskaa bhi koi aadhaar nahin he kyonki aarope patr main kaha gaya he licenson kii nilaamee kar sarkaar adhik kamai kar sakati thi
 The defense counsel said, 'these words cannot be the basis of the trial as the appropriate paragraph (a) in the charge sheet is a complete myth
 ’unhone tark diya, ‘swaan telikam privet limited or unitech wireles tamilnadu privet limited (donon ghotaale kii kathith labhaarthi) dwaara videshi companiyon kramash: etisalaat or telenor ko sheyaron kii bikri ko sarkaar dwaara manjuuri di gai thi
 This was not a sale of licenses and hence no loss
 ’ dramuk pramukh em karunanidhi kii beti kii ore se pesh vakil ne poocha, ‘bikri kahaan hui (licenson kii)? dhokhadhadi kahaan hui?’kanimojhi ko sibiai ne ghotaale main unki kathith bhoomika ke liye 30 may ko giraftaar kiya tha
 His arguments are still going on in protest against allegations of corruption and fraud and criminal conspiracy in the 2G case
 kanimojhi khud ko aarope mukt karne ke liye usee tarah ke tark de rahi hai jaise ki purv doorsanchaar mantri e raja ne die the
 He too sought to drag the Prime Minister and Chidambaram into the matter, saying that the issue of dilution of stake by spectrum license holders was discussed with them
 varisht adhivaktaa susheel kumaar raja or kanimojhi donon kii vakaalat kar rahe hai

 After coming to the government, the law came which was better than the law of the Center - inserted a provision in which the Lokpal of Delhi will investigate the minister of the center, which AAP knew so it did not make the law - promises to bring Swaraj, end VIP culture But did the reverse after coming to power - gave 399 contracts in Delhi, increased MLA salary 4 times, all started moving in big trains like vips - promised to make teachers permanent Ekin nothing did his government could not afford the corruption elimination and talked about bringing back black money but brought phrase of Notbandi not done anything that went over livelihood of the common man, the bank people, ek saal pehle manohar parrikar ne 700 karod main kharidne kii baat kahi thi-rafel deal raksha saudeka sabase bada ghotaalaa he- modi ji ne chunavi raily main jayanti tex kii baat kahi thi jab paryaavaran mantri kaa vivaad saamne aayaa tha- shivaraj singh chouhan ko, raman singh or shila dikshit ko karodon rupye dene kaa hisaab in filon main likhaa hua- agle chunaav main in tamaam muddon ko hamen le janaa chahie- dilli main AAP, MCD or centre main bijepi he
 Three governments, all three useless, immense corruption - Ramlila Maidan will ask the people for accounts from these governments
 
 
 - shanti bhushan ne ramlila maidan main swaraj india ke 'jawaab do hisaab do' raily main centre sarkaar se apil kii he ki wo dilli main AAP sarkaar ko dismiss karke raashtrapati shashan lagu kare- supreme court main dilli ke adhikaron kaa faisla jald aa jayega
 The constitution is so clear that Kejriwal's defeat is certain - Kejriwal went to Punjab due to lack of power in Delhi, the special features of Shanti Bhushan's speech
 
 
 - swaraj kii baat kehane vaale aravind kejariwal ne memaurity kii baat kahkar swaraj kii baat over rule kar diya- jis party kaa samvidhan maine taiyaar kiya or jhaadu kaa nishaan maine tay kiya tha- ek gaanaa party ke liye likhaa tha lekin aam aadmi party ke baad aravind kejariwal ko pahchaan nahin paaya- aravind kejariwal ko aapane siem bana diya or 67 seat se unka dimag bighad gaya- kejariwal ne world class city kii bajaay varst city banaakar chhod diya- kejariwal ko samajhnaa chahie tha ki centre ke saath milakar kaam karnaa hota he lekin unhone jhagada shuru kar diya taaki 2019 main pradhanmantri ban sake- lekin wo na to vidhayak banengen or nahin siem- aam aadmi party na goa main jeet rahi he or nahin punjab main- supreme court main dilli ke adhikaron kaa faisla jald aa jayega samvidhan itnaa spasht he ki kejariwal kii haar tay he- centre sarkaar dilli main AAP sarkaar ko dismiss karke raashtrapati shashan lagu kareyogendra yadav spich pointers-dilli ke dipti siem kehete hai ki devli sangam vihaar main pani pahunchaa diya
 People who came here, tell us what the water reached? -delhi's common man and woman have been saying for the past 1 month from Kejriwal government, give two more answers - Temporary teacher has not been appointed - Know the transporter outside Delhi and return the green tax AAP had to give - Delhi AAP had promised for the countryside but the demands were not met - said to give ownership to the irregular colony in 1 year but did not get it - Destruction in Delhi The 399 new contracts were not reduced - (yogendra Yadav got the three government contracts spread from platform to platform) - Election of MCD is coming
 aam aadmi party ke siem ko dilli kaa siem bole yaa punjab yaa goa kaa-ham aam aadmi party se rhit tu ricol kii maang karte hai- punjab ke siem agar nahin chune jate hai to punjab kii seva hi karen dilli kaa pind chhod den-67 seat ke saath 250 se zyada nigam seat aapako mili-136 ward agar AAP ko aane vaale chunaav main mil jaye to right to recall kii maang ham vaapis le lenge
 With less seats than this, Kejriwal resigns - the people of Delhi now want the option, which is now the responsibility of the people - for the MCD elections we announce the beginning - when Delhi can burst Modi's balloon then what is the chance of small balloons is rakanpa pramukh sharad pavaar ke purv sahyogi or kolhapur se saansad sadashiv mandlic ne un par apane raajnneetik mitron ko dagaa dene kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki congress ke saath pavaar kaa gatirodh sirf unki khurafati kshamta kaa pradarshan tha
 Mandlik said, "sharad Pawar's political move aims to prove his potential

 centre main satta parivartan ke baad mangalvaar ko uttar pradesh ke rajyapal biel joshi ne istipha de diya he
 The resignations of Karnataka Governor Hansraj Bhardwaj and Assam Governor JB Patnaik were also reported, but both have denied this
 assam ke rajyapal ne kaha ki unhone apane pad se istipha nahin diya he
 He said, i met the President but the resignation is wrong

 On 31st, the term of seven governors is ending

 It is estimated that she is the female governor and none other than the Governor of Kerala, Sheela Dixit
 akhbaar ne likhaa he ki kendriya grih sachiv anil goswami ne chah rajyapalon se baat karke unhen nai sarkaar kii manshaa bataai
 They were asked to send their resignations

 bataaya jaataa he ki shila dikshit ne istipha dene se inkaar kar diya he
 He has said that he will leave the post only after the new government gives this order

 The UPA discharged four governors appointed by the BJP after coming to power in 2004
 inamen upi or gujarat ke rajyapal bhi the
 With that decision, the BJP and the NDA were stunned
 bijepi ke empi beepi singhl to is mudde par adaalat chale gaye the
 The Governor is not an employee of the Center: The Court, in its order in 2010, said that the Governor is not a Central Government employee and cannot be removed in the name of eroding trust
 lekin adaalat ne yah bhi kaha ki centre sarkaar aise rajyapalon ko hataane ke liye kaaran bataate hue raashtrapati ko likhe jo apni ichha se unhen rakhen yaa hataaen
 The newspaper has written that the government is intent on removing these governors and for this the cabinet can give its recommendation
 vah supreme court ke aadesh ko baadha ke rup main nahin dekh rahi he
 "we have enough reason to remove them," said an official

 bihar kii raajnneeti main bahut kuch ho rahaa he jisase har din ek nayaa raajnneetik kayaas shuru ho jaataa he
 
 
 Especially whether Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's relations with his old relative and current rival BJP are getting sweet
 taaja ghatnakram main janata dal united ne 15 janvari ko makar sakranti parv ke bhoj main bijepi netaaon ko aamantrit karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 The announcement was made every year by the organizer of this banquet and the president of Bihar Janata Dal United, Vasishtha Narayan Singh in Patna today
 singh ke anusaar is saal bijepi netaaon ko bhi nimantran bheja ja rahaa he
 This banquet of lion includes chuda, curd, tilkut, sweets and vegetables
 mana ja rahaa he ki singh ne yah ghoshnaa nitish kii sahmati ke baad kii he
 However, on the occasion of Makar Sankranti, a banquet is also organized at the home of Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav
 is saal bhi lalu ne pehle se sabko media ke madhyam se nimantran bheja he
 It is also certain that Nitish will go to Lalu Yadav's house before his feast
 abhi tak yahi paripati rahi he ki nitish ke bhoj main satta ke sahyogi shaamil hote hai or lalu ke bhoj main unke rajnatik mitra
 But this is the first time that his political opponent has also been invited to the banquet
 haalanki bihar bijepi ke adhyaksh nityanand roy kaa kahana he ki abhi tak nimantran nahin mila he or unhen bhi media ke madhyam se jaankaree mil rahi he
 When the invitation is received, a decision will be taken to join
 isse spasht he ki nityanand party alaakaman ke nirdesh par hi bhoj main shaamil hone yaa na hone kaa faisla lenge
 The comments haal ke dinon main nitish or bijepi ke sambandhon main badhati madhurata ke silsile main is nimantran ko ek or kadi bataaya ja rahaa he
 Recently, when BJP national president Amit Shah came to Patna, he did not comment on Nitish or the state government
 rajnatik prekshkon kaa maananaa he ki nitish kumaar ke sharabbandi ke mudde par 21 janvari ko maanav shrinkhalaa main bhaag lene kaa faisla bhi kendriya netritv kaa tha
 BJP leaders say that after Prime Minister Narendra Modi supported the decision of prohibition of prohibition on the occasion of Prakash Utsav, the scope of sourness has further reduced
 haalanki nitish ne unifarm civil code ke masale par centre kii prashnawali ko khaarij kar diya or lau kamishan ke adhyaksh ko patr likhakar uski khamiyaan gina di thim
 After the new politics of invitation, the people of the entire country will certainly have their eyes on the Makar Sankranti banquet to be held in Patna this year
 ukt ghoshnaa har saal is bhoj ke aayojak or bihar janata dal united ke adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne aaj patna main kii
 According to Singh, invitation is also being sent to BJP leaders this year
 singh ke is bhoj main chuda, dahi, tilkut, mithai ke alaava sabji hoti he
 It is believed that Singh made this announcement after Nitish's consent
 haalanki makar sankranti ke avasar par rashtriya janata dal ke adhyaksh lalu yadav ke ghar par bhi bhoj kaa aayojan hota he
 This year too, Lalu has already sent invitations to everyone through the media
 yah bhi tay he ki nitish apane bhoj ke pehle lalu yadav ke ghar jaaenge
 Till now the practice has been that Nitish's banquet consists of power allies and Lalu's banquet as his political friends
 lekin yah pehali baar he ki apane rajnatik virdohi ko bhi bhoj main aamantrit kiya gaya he
 However, Bihar BJP president Nityanand Roy says that the invitation has not been received yet and he too is getting information through the media
 jab nimantrann milegaa tab shaamil hone kaa faisla liya jayega
 It is clear from this that Nityanand will decide whether or not to join the banquet on the instructions of the party high command
 tippaniyan In recent times, this invitation is being called another link in connection with the growing sweetness in the relationship between Nitish and BJP
 pichley dinon bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah jab patna aae tab unhone nitish yaa rajya sarkaar par kisi tarah kaa coment nahin kiya tha
 Political observers believe that Nitish Kumar's decision to participate in a human chain on January 21 on the issue of prohibition was also of the central leadership
 bijepi ke netaaon kaa kahana he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne prakaash utsav ke maukey par sharabbandi ke faisle kaa jaise samarthan kiya uske baad khatas kii gunjaaish or kam ho gai he
 However, Nitish rejected the Centre's questionnaire on the issue of uniform civil code and wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Law Commission and pointed out its flaws
 nimantran kii nai raajnneeti ke baad nishchit rup se is saal patna main hone vaale makar sankranti ke bhoj par puure desh ke logon kii najar hogi
 However, on the occasion of Makar Sankranti, a banquet is also organized at the home of Rashtriya Janata Dal President Lalu Yadav

 karnataka main bhaajapa ke siem pad ke ummidavaar bies yediurppa chunavi ranneeti tay karne main free hand chaahate hai
 Yeddyurappa, who is on a Parivartan Yatra, is said to be uncomfortable with the remarks of BJP leaders from outside the state regarding the state Chief Minister Siddaramaiah
 gauratlab he ki haal hi main uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne karnataka main siddaramaiya par siyaasi hamalaa bolaa tha
 After this, the BJP president also made a similar comment on Siddaramaiah
 yediurppa ke najdiki netaaon se mili jaankaree ke mutabik yeduurappa isse asahaj hai
 The Chief Minister is trying to make the political attack on him an issue of external versus local
 lekin bhaajapa ke donon bade netaaon party adhyaksh amit shah or yogi adityanath kii aalochana rajya sarkaar se adhik siddharmaiya par nijee hamalaa prathit hota he
 Sources say that Yeddyurappa has indicated this to the central leaders
 yediurppa chaah rahe hai ki 28 janvari tak jab tak unki parivartan yatra samaapt nahin ho jaae rajya sarkaar kii naakaamiyon ko ujagar kar yediurppa ke samay kii uplabdhiyon ko saamne laane par focus kiya jaae
 Thus, anti-incumbency should be established as an issue first
 iske baad ise bada banane ke liye nijee hamale kiye ja sakate hai
 It is believed that Yeddyurappa is wishing that the manner in which the PM candidate during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Narendra Modi was just talking about development, making the anti-incumbency trend against Congress a big issue, the same formula applied in Karnataka too

 baari-baari se yachikaayen lagaakar deree kar rahe aaropeeh vakilsarkaari agency apni kumbhakarna kii neend main soi hui hai: jhanirbhaya gangrape maamle main 13 disambar ko hone vaali sunwaayee par sabaki nigahen tiki hui hai
 In such a situation, advocate Jitendra Jha, who argued for the application of Nirbhaya to be hanged fast, says that if the system works, then Nirbhaya convicts can be hanged within a month

 Jitendra Jha said that one of the reasons for the delay in hanging in Nirbhaya's case is that the government agency is sleeping in its Kumbhkaran
 faansee main lagaataar ho rahi deree par unhone kaha ki dilli sarkaar ne faansee jald karaane ke liye koi koshish nahin kii
 Advocate Jitendra Jha said that it was the responsibility of the Delhi government, when the court rejected the review petition of 3 people, there should have been an attempt by the government to hang them at the earliest, but this was not done
 in chaaron doshiyon ko yah pataa he ki un sabhi ko sajaa ek saath di jaaegi isiilie vah is maamle ko or lanbaa khinchne ke liye ek-ek karke yachika laga rahe hai
 They are taking full advantage of this system flaw

 Nirbhaya's parents had also filed for early execution in December last year, on which the hearing could start only after 1 year because there is a shortage of judges even in the fast track court, then the case was transferred to another judge
 akshay kii pitishan par vakil jitendra jha ne kaha ki ab akshay ne jo rivyuu pitishan supreme court main lagaai he, uske khaarij hone ke 100 fisadi chances hai, kyonki grounds bahut kamjor he, or haasyaaspad he
 The Supreme Court has already dismissed the petition of the remaining three

 aamtaur par netaa apni party kaa hi poster lagaate hai magar press conference room main jangal raaj tu kaa poster maanjhi ke samarthan ke elaan se kuch minute pehle hataa liya gaya
 You are watching the video of the same
 bijepi daftar main jangal raaj tu kaa ek poster shuukravaar ko bhi laga mila
 In which written is the beginning of Jungle Raj Two, Remote Government, Sahama Bihar
 15 november ko bihar bijepi ne jangal raaj tu kaa ek bocolate bhi nikaala tha jiske aath pannon main maanjhi par thana bechney se lekar bidio kii posting kii nilaamee ke aarope lagaae gaye hai
 It is difficult to understand why Manjhi, who changed the name of an engineering college to Jagannath Mishra, is fighting the fight for his caste-based self-respect
 jagannatha mishra chaara ghotaale maamle main sazaayaftaa hai
 Why would the BJP not see this as an insult to a college named after a convict? patna stesan par jediu ne poster lagaaya he jisamen nitish kii tarif main atal or adwani ke bayaan chape hai
 Five question posters of Delhi elections have also reached Patna
 is poster main nitish ke bare main kaha gaya he ki ve jis jis ke saath rahe hai unhen dhokhaa diya he
 Obviously, there is still some mud to be done in the politics of Bihar
 press conference kar nitish kumaar ne kaha ki bijepi baar-baar mahadalit mahadalit bolkar sanvaidhanik padon par baithe logon kii jatigat pahchaan kar rahi he jo thik nahin he
 But while making Manjhi as the Chief Minister, did the JDU not publicize the fact that Manjhi belongs to the Mushar caste
 nitish ne kaha ki bijepi jis spikar par hamale kar rahi he wo bhi mahadalit varg se aate hai
 Attacking an impartial speaker is an honor for Mahadalit
 bijepi unki party todakar apana khel chal rahi thi jisamen fail ho gai he
 Whoever could not defeat BJP and Manjhi Nitish in the name of Mahadalit's self-respect
 nitish ne kaha ki maanjhi ko party ke faisle kaa sammaan karnaa chahie tha
 Nitish said that BJP used to bring sharpness in the mind of the people on the basis of religion, now it is playing the card of cast to make a sense of ethnicity in society
 par kya nitish ke paas cast kaa koi card nahin
 Sushil Kumar Modi said that Chief Minister Manjhi had claimed that i have a majority, only to prove it
 ham log to
 
 
 One stood next to the Mahadalit to avenge the insult to a Mahadalit
 kya bijepi kii yah safai paryaapt he yaa maanjhi ne bijepi ko bhi fansaa diya
 Did the BJP rely on Manjhi based on mere verbal assertion of majority
 samvidhan kaa sawaal bada tha yaa mahadalit ke apmaan kaa
 Sushil Modi denied Nitish Kumar's accusations that bjp's script was not written by Bihar
 narendra modi ne nahin likhi he
 Sharad Yadav, Nitish Kumar and Manjhi's negotiation negotiations failed before Manjhi went to Delhi
 bijepi ne bhi maanjhi kaa samarthan kiya he ki agar vidhayak hamaare liye matdaan karte to unki sadsyta jane kaa khatra tha
 Will the BJP itself allow its party MLA to vote without a whip
 agar bijepi kaa koi vidhayak nitish ke samarthan main vot kar de to bijepi kya karegi
 Will take action to terminate membership in violation of whip or respect the democratic right of the said MLA
 donon taraf se chalane vaali daleelein dudhari talwaar kii tarah hai

 Or the picture is yet to be seen in Bihar
 prime time Actor-director Randhir Kapoorka, son of 'showman' Raj Kapoor of Indian films, says he will never make a remake of RK Films' superhit film 'awara', as no one can replicate the performances of Prithviraj Kapoor and Raj Kapoor
 'logon ne kai baar kaha, ranbir-rishi ke saath 'aawaara' banaaun'randhir kapur ne 1991 main 'hina' film kaa nirdesan kiya tha
 He said that once he got the idea to remake his father's classic film, but later gave up the idea
 randhir ne kaha, 'log mujhase aksar kehete hai ki mainranbir kapooraurarishi kapurko lekar 'aawaara' kaa rimek banaaun
 But when i started work on this project, we were all afraid that from where will Prithviraj Kapoor and Raj Kapoor sir be brought? Where do we get a musician pair like Shankar Jaikishan? Where can i find a songwriter like Shailendra? And how will he also include the dream sequence in the film? So i am not in favor of making a remake
 'debyue film 'kal aaj or kal' kaa rimek banaaenge randhirbhale hi prithviraj or rajkpur kii film 'aawaara' kaa rimek randhir nahin banane vaale, lekin vah is jodi kii duusari film 'kal aaj or kal' ko dobaaraa banaaenge
 The film is Randhir's first Bollywood film
 is film main unki patni babita bhi hai
 Work on this project will begin next year
 unhone kaha ki vah film 'kal aaj or kal' kii rimek banaaenge, lekin yah ek acchhee film hogi'
 The last film under the banner of Randhari Kapoor was 'aa Ab Laut Chalen' in 1999 with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna in the lead roles

 But 6 June was a little different in this case, because a day earlier in Bhopal, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced that the farmers' reasonable demands had been accepted
 unhone jor dekar kaha ki hinsa karne vaale asaamaajik tatwon se sakhti se nibata jayega

 On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, taking time out of the busy series of programs to complete the three years of his government, after the cabinet meeting in Delhi on 7 June, on the issue of farmers, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Road Transport Minister Nitin Had a meeting with Gadkari
 bataaya gaya ki pradhanmantri krishi mantri ko mandsaur bhejnaa chaahate the, lekin unhone maujuuda halaat main madhya pradesh jane se manaa kar diya
 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's sharp reaction to the whole situation was, "this government has waged a war against the farmers of the country
" ’’lekin isse kisaanon kii buniyadi samasyaon par koi fark nahin padaa
 The farmers could not believe that the bumper crop of pulses they had grown on the encouragement of the government had a minimum support price of Rs 5,050

 Paramilitary forces were sent from the Center to Madhya Pradesh to control the situation

 rahul ne kaha, ''modi ji kisaanon kaa karj maaf nahin kar sakate, sahi rate or bonus nahin de sakate, muaavja nahin de sakate, sirf kisaan ko goli de sakate hai
 "but all these developments gave a new impetus to the peasant movements going on in other parts of the country
" tamilnadu, maharashtra, rajasthan, punjab or uttar pradesh ke kisaan bhi apni maangon ko lekar sadak par utarane lage

 '' On the other hand, the Yogi Adityanath government in UP has got one lakh small farmers

 In such a situation, on June 8, farmers in western Uttar Pradesh performed a fierce demonstration in many places
 andolan kaa centre ab bhi madhya pradesh hi bana hua he
 Chief Minister Chauhan is appealing to maintain equal peace, but he will also have to think why did he ignore the agitating farmers movement that is becoming violent day by day? After all, what was the order in which his agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen kept telling the farmers to stop the agitation first, then there would be a thing? Who suggested them? Chauhan and other chief ministers have to accept that the farmers are really desperate
 is hataasha main ve akele pad jate hai to khudakushi kar lete hai or sangathit ho jate hai to andolan main apni jaan de dete hai
 In such a situation, governments will have to look for long-term sensitive measures, leaving the strategy of jumble and questioning

 In such a situation, know what is this Article 35A, which gives separate rights to the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 kya he anuchhed35a?anuchhed 35A, jammu-kashmir ko rajya ke rup main vishesh adhikaar detaa he
 The rights granted under it are related to 'permanent residents'
 iskaa matlab he ki rajya sarkaar ko ye adhikaar he ki wo aazaadee ke vakt duusari jagahon se aae sharnaarthiyon or anya bhartiya nagarikon ko jammu-kashmir main kis tarah kii sahuliyatein de athwa nahin de
 When did Article 35A? Article 35A, on 14 May 1954, the then President Dr
 rajendra prasad ne ek aadesh paarit kiya tha
 Through this order, a new Article 35A was added to the Constitution of India
 nahin kharid sakate jamiunuchhed 35A, dhara 370 kaa hi hissaa he
 Due to this clause, no citizen of other states can buy property in Jammu and Kashmir nor can stay as a permanent citizen of that place
 jammu-kashmir kaa samvidhan?jammu kashmir kaa samvidhan 1956 main banaaya gaya tha
 According to this constitution, a permanent citizen is a person who was a citizen of the state on 14 May 1954 or has been living in the state for 10 years before that
 saath hi usne vahaan sampatti hasil kii ho
 According to Article 35A, if a girl from Jammu and Kashmir marries an outsider, then all her rights are terminated
 saath hi uske bacchon ke adhikaar bhi khatm ho jate hai
 Article 35A of the Constitutional Constitution, not in the Constitution, was given place in the Constitution on 14 May 1954 by order of the President
 samvidhan sabha se lekar sansad kii kisi bhi kaarywahi main, kabhi anuchhed 35A ko samvidhan kaa hissaa banane ke sandarbh main kisi samvidhan sanshodhan yaa bill laane kaa zikr nahin miltaa he
 The then government used the power obtained under Section 370 to implement Article 35A
 kyon uthi hataane kii maang?is anuchhed kohtaane ke liye ek daleel ye di ja rahi he ki ise sansad ke jariye lagu nahin karavaayagaya tha
 The second argument is that a large number of refugees from Pakistan came to India at the time of Partition
 inamen lakhon kii taadaad main sharnaarthi jammu-kashmir rajya main bhi rah rahe hai
 The Government of Jammu and Kashmir, through Article 35A, denied all these Indian citizens a permanent resident certificate of Jammu and Kashmir
 in vanchiton main 80 fisad log pichde or dalit hindu samudaay se hai
 Simultaneously, the Jammu and Kashmir government discriminates against women and other Indian citizens who get married in Jammu and Kashmir under the guise of Article 35A
 logon ne supreme court khatkataya darwajasupreme court main daakhil yachika main logon ne shikaayat kii thi ki anuchhed 35A ke kaaran samvidhan pradutt unke mul adhikaar jammu-kashmir rajya main chin liye gaye hai, lihaajarashtrapati ke aadesh se lagu is dhara ko centre sarkaar fouran raddakiya jaae

 Premium charges apply!! Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar has expressed concern about Union Minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Nitin Gadkari
 unhone shanivaar ko kaha ki gadakari ke liye vah chintit hai kyonki unhen pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sambhavit vikalp ke rup main pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Gadkari was in the news recently when he appeared to be sarcastic at the top leadership of his own party BJP after the party's defeat in the assembly elections in three states Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan
 saath hi kuch din pehle unhone kaha tha ki jo ghar nahin sambhaal saktaa, vah desh kya sanbhaalega
 Gadkari's remarks were also seen as a taunt on the BJP leadership
 baharhaal, maharashtra ke sholapur main patrakaron se baatcheet main pavaar ne kaha, 'gadakari mere dost hai
 We have worked together
 unka naam (modi ke vikalp ke rup main) pesh kiya ja rahaa he or yahi kaaran he ki main unke liye chintit hum
 However, Pawar did not say anything else about it
 saath hi ensipi pramukh ne is dauraan yah bhi saaf kar diya ki raaj thakare kii maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke saath unki party gathbandhan ko lekar koi baat nahin kar rahi he
 Rahul Gandhi has also praised: Congress President Rahul Gandhi has also praised Nitin Gadkari before Sharad Pawar
 asal main, gadakari ke haal ke kuch bayanon kii prishthbhumi main rahul gandhi ne 4 farvari 2019 ko unki tarif kii thi
 Rahul Gandhi said that Gadkari is the only leader in the BJP who has some courage and in such a situation he should also speak on the issues of Rafael, farmers and unemployment
 rahul gandhi ne gadakari ke bayaan se judi khabar share karte hue twit kar kaha tha, 'gadakari ji, aapaki saraahna karata hum
 You are the only one in the BJP who has some courage
 kripaya aap (gadakari) rafel ghotaale or anil ambani, kisaanon kii pidaa or sansthaaon ko nasht kiye jane par bhi tippanee kariye
 In another tweet, the Congress President said, Oh, Mr
 Gadkari
 maafee chahta hum
 i had forgotten the most important subject-job
 ' us dauraan rahul gandhi ne jo khabar share kii he uske mutabik gadakari ne kaha he ki jo apana parivaar nahin sambhaal saktaa, vah desh kya sanbhaalega
 Significantly, Gadkari has made some such statements in recent times which are being seen as a target of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a section of opposition parties and media, although Gadkari in a conversation with a private TV channel has clearly denied this
 Huh
 unhone kahana tha ki unke bayanon ko tod-marodakar pesh kiya ja rahaa he

 yah rakam sachin tendulkar ko brands or utpaadon ke vigyaapan se hone vaali kamai se 40 fisadi zyada he

 Pandey says that Riddhi took over his management in 2010
 vishwa cap main jeet ne unke kaarobaar ko kaaphi badha diya
 "in those days (before Dhoni and Riddhi were formed), they got between 2
5 and 3 crores on a brand
 milte the, ab 10 karod ru
 See you us vakt kul raashi thi 40 karod ru
 100 crore today

 You know how long a player's career is
 ek brands ke bataur dhoni in sabase upar uth chuke hai
 Talking about Dhoni is like talking about India
 ”dhoni hameshaa se aisi sthiti main nahin rahe hai
 In the early days, he had a deal with NDTV for exclusive interviews, talks and special programs to build his brand
 is saude ke bare main ghoshnaa karne ke liye may 2006 main ravivaar kii ek dopaher dhoni press conference main aae, to ve puri baanh vaali matamaili tishart pahane, lambey baalo main the
 It seemed that there was some new guy who was trying to look serious
 saal bhar baad kii baat he, ve kaamyaab ho chuke the
 Without India's Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, as soon as the team won the T20 World Cup, Dhoni had the same name on the tongue
 pandey ranjai main dhoni ke saath khel chuke the or us vakt tak ve samaj chuke the ki unki pratibha itani hi he
 During that time, he spent some time in a T-series company where he became friends with Gulshan Kumar's brother Darshan Kumar
 darshan ne unhen vahaan kuch kaam die, jisase unki samaj bad saki
 He made a sudden leap in 2007 and founded a company called Riddhi Sports
 pehle dhoni kaa sara prabandhan gemplan or phir baad main mindscape mestros karti thim lekin pandey lagaataar dhoni ke saath bane hue the
 Pandey told, "I got Dhoni deals for Big Bazaar and Dainik Bhaskar
 chunki maahi ke saath meraa rishta tha, to jeet (gemplan ke pramukh banerjee) ko bhi mere hi raste maahi tak janaa padataa tha
 Mahi told everyone that only one can reach them through Pandeji
 maine mehnat shuru kii, chaar qaraar kiye
 "the man who got India the first title after 1983, Rs 50 to 60 lakh to handle it
 katai paryaapt na the
 Dhoni also suffered some damage
 ek fishan deal thi, jisamen unke ek kareebi par farjivade kaa aarope laga tha
 However this accelerated the process of getting closer to Riddhi and Dhoni
 2010 main dhoni ne teen saal ke dauraan nunatam 210 karod ru
 Tied up with Riddhi to guarantee
 ab dhoni ne aadhikarik taur par tendulkar ko peeche chhod diya he, jinka pichhlaa sauda teen saal ke liye 180 karod ru
 Belonged to dhoni or riddhi kaa rishta sirf praayojan kii fees tak nahin rukaa, balki inhone milakar praayojan ke niyamon ko badalanaa shuru kar diya
 Some changes came from the field itself
 dhoni ke up-captain banane par unki fees dedh karod ru

 She reached pandey kehete hai ki 2011 kii vishwa cap jeet ke baad kisi vigyaapan saude ke liye 10 karod nikalvaanaa maamuli baat rah gai
 The big deals are all being done for a long time
 kam-se-kam paanch aise saude hue hai jinamein riti yaa dhoni yaa phir donon ko hi baraabar kaa hissaa mila he
 The thinking is that the brand Dhoni remained alive in the market even after he retired and after a career that lasted for a few years, he was able to overcome the problem faced by every player
 muskaraate hue pandey kehete hai, ''ve mere dost hai
 i am older than them

 Between April and June 2012, compared to the first three months of this year, there has been a sharp decline in the chances of getting jobs in key sectors (IT, Financial Services, Telecom and Hospitality) that employ the economy
 videsh main mandi or desh main nitigat pakshaaghaat se naukari talashne vaale yuvaaon kaa duruswapn khatm hota nahin dikh rahaa
 The Assocham survey indicated where jobs would decline both in terms of industry and geographic area

 For the first time in this quarterly survey conducted from july-september 2010, 84% of the 150 companies surveyed had predicted that further recruitment would decline or remain stable
 fikki ke survey main anumaan lagaaya gaya he ki agle chah maah tak growth ‘‘bales’’ yani naukari na paidaa kar sakane vaali hogi
 The GDP growth rate in the first six months of 2012 decreased to 5 on average
 4 fisadi hi rah jane se nai naukariyon main katautee kerani padi he
 There is a huge gap in employment generation at the rate of 5 and 7 per cent
 2011-12 main yahi growth rate rahaa he
 Due to this the difference has increased to 30 lakhs
 arthshaastri bibek debaroy bataate hai, ‘’7 fisadi kii growth par arthvyavastha main 1
 05 crore jobs are created
 lekin 5 fisadi kii growth par yah aankada sirf 75 lakh ho saktaa he
 "industrial growth has stagnated and the erratic monsoon has hit agricultural growth this year as well, due to which the prospects for the remaining months of 2012 are looking bleak

 Was
 janvari main unki naukari chali gai or aath maheene tak ve naukari talashte rahe
 He finally started Food and Beverage Consultancy in Delhi in July, but his business is still running loose
 sharma is tarah sangharsh karne vaale akele nahin hai
 In September 2011, 24-year-old chartered accountant from Delhi, Dishant Gupta, took less than a week to find a job
 iske aath maheene baad april, 2012 main unhone naukari chhod di
 They have since sent resumes to 20 companies, but to no avail
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘lagata he ki naukariyaan khatm ho gai hai
 "from a growth rate of 8% in 2010-11 in India to a growth rate of only 5% in 2012-13, it is as if a western country has gone into recession with a growth rate of 3%

 Reforms in the insurance, banking and retail sectors would have accelerated growth and rising employment but reforms are stuck
 sansad kaa monsoon satr koyala ghotaale kii bhent chadh gaya he
 In the current environment, the job environment for different sectors may come in different forms
 ity sector sabase zyada is baat par nirbhar rahata he ki videshon main aarthik maahaul kis had tak sudharta he
 Sectors such as banking, finance, telecom, and retail depend on which side of the domestic policies
 lekin sarkaar jis tarah se ghotaale-dar-ghotaale ke bich chal rahi he, uske maddenjar sthiti niraashajanak hi dikh rahi he
 Information Technology, Darwaje Bandit Sector is the largest sector providing white collar jobs
 asochaum ke survey ke anusaar, is sector ne 2012 ke janvari se march ke dauraan 66,000 nai bhartiyon kii thim, lekin april se june, 2012 ke dauraan is sector main sirf 46,000 ke kareeb hi bhartiyon huin
 After this, the highest employing sector academics (schools and universities are still the leading sectors) employed only 9,000 people during January to March and 13,000 recruitments have been made between April and June whereas the IT sector has only 15
 25 percent of the employment was created

 yah udaarikaran ke baad kaa pehla aisa daur tha jisamen badi sankhya main white collar karmchaariyon kii chantni hui
 The reason for this was the deterioration of the condition of banks and insurance companies, especially foreign equity and private companies

 kapil mishra or kumaar vishwaas ne bagaavati sur main kiye gaye ek duusare ke twit ko na sirf ritvit kiya balki kot twit bhi kiya
 For example, when Kapil Mishra tweeted a letter to the ACB in the tanker scam questioning Sheila Dixit on Saturday afternoon at 12
14 pm, Kumar Vishwas proceeded to put that tweet with a clap and thumbs up

 kumaar vishwaas ko andaaza to hoga kapil mishra ko lekar
 After all, did they just stand behind him? And if you stood with the confidence of fighting against corruption then why did you start cutting Kapil Mishra's charge? These are not two separate things

 Kumar Vishwas, who became noticed on several channels one after the other, attacked Kejriwal's claim by refusing to accept evms as the reason for the defeat

 Perhaps this is why they also tolerate the linguistic rudeness of their younger brother
 apane kavy or bhashaa style se samaa baandh dene vaale kumaar vishwaas bahut hi kritasankalpi hone kaa bhram dete rahe hai
 But Kejriwal seems to have a great mantra to keep his feelings under control
 saraji kii usee sammohan vidya ne vishwaas ko apane hi shabdon se diga diya he
 Or, as Kumar Vishwas took cognizance of one retweet on May 4, believe that 'truth has been troubled for some time but not defeated yet'? unka tazaatreen twit kahata he, "arvind se meraa 12 varsh kaa parichay he or itane saal kaam karne ke baad main kah saktaa hum ki @arvindkejriwal bhrashtachar karegaa ye main soch bhi nahin saktaa

 When Kumar's faith in Kejwariwal was so strong, then why were bugle bunting to continue to raise voice against corruption inside and outside? Kejriwal is the true Harishchandra of politics, then who in his party should corruption? And that too after waving a red flag from a confidant like Kumar? vishwaas kaa hi shanivaar raat kaa twit he, 'ek andolan or sahi, na thake hai, na dare hai, satta ke kisi ghade kaa boond bhar jal bhi nahin chakhaa isliye abhitak jantar mantar kii aag baaqi he saathiyon aashwast raho

 zaahir he is twit main na sirf unpar nishaanaa he balki jantar mantar kii raah pakadaney kii aparoksh dhamkee bhi he
 But it seems that after this tweet by his heroic head, the Kejriwal camp too may have pulled some arrows from his quiver

 Be assured guys aam aadmi party cover karne vaale patrkaar hi baar-baar ye kehete rahe hai ki kapil mishra kumaar vishwaas ke nazadiiki hai
 Kapil Mishra and Kumar Vishwas not only retweeted each other's tweet in rebellious tone, but also tweeted
 masalan jab kapil mishra ne tanker ghotaale main shila dikshit se poochtacha kii babat asibi ko likhi chitthee ko shanivaar dopaher 12 baj kar 14 minute par twit kiya to kumaar vishwaas ne us twit ko tali or thams ap ke nishaan ke saath aage badhaate hue likhaa, "bhrashtachar par koi samjhauta nahin @kapilmishraaap" No compromise on corruption @kapilmishraaaphttps: / / t

 Kumar Vishwas will have an idea about Kapil Mishra
 aakhir kya ve uske peeche yun hi khadey ho gaye? or bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ladaai ke bharose ke saath khadey hue to phir kapil mishra ke aarope ko kyon kaatane lage? ye do alag baaten nahin hai
 It states that Kumar was either a victim of over-confidence or of some confusion
 or ye unki belaag chhavi ke barkhilaaf he
 The comments nagar nigam chunaav main ummid se bahut kam mili seat ko aam aadmi party kii karaari haar ke taur par dekha gaya

 The distrust gap between the two widened so much that the trust tweet started posting Danadan tweets

 Perhaps this is why they also tolerate the linguistic rudeness of their younger brother
 apane kavy or bhashaa style se samaa baandh dene vaale kumaar vishwaas bahut hi kritasankalpi hone kaa bhram dete rahe hai
 But Kejriwal seems to have a great mantra to keep his feelings under control
 saraji kii usee sammohan vidya ne vishwaas ko apane hi shabdon se diga diya he
 Or, as Kumar Vishwas took cognizance of a retweet on May 4, believe that 'truth has been troubled for some time but has not been defeated yet'

 yah puskaar saarvajanik or raajnneetik jivan main eemaandaaree ke liye unhen yah sammaan diya gaya
 The award was given to the Chief Minister by Jammu and Kashmir Governor SN Vohra
 rajyapal ne mukhyamantri ko topi or angavastr bhi bhent kiya
 While addressing the function organized on this occasion, the Chief Minister said that i first of all thank heartily to Mohatma Mehbooba Mufti on this occasion
 unhone mujhe mufti sahib kii smriti kaa ek sammaan 'probity in politics and public life' dene kaa nirnay kiya
 i was very happy when i was informed about it
 mufti sahab ke saath jo hamaara sambandh rahaa he vah bahut acha he
 He said that when the government was formed under the leadership of VP Singh ji at the Center and Mufti Saheb was Home Minister, in that government also i had the opportunity to do some work as a Minister of State, that is in its place, but when one The Janata Dal became a political party and his role in it was VP Singhji, the national president of that party, he formed a political affairs committee of the party
 usamen sabase pehle mukhya baton par ve charchaa kiya karte the
 i was also a member in that committee
 unhone kaha ki kai baar mufti sahab ke ghar par us political afares kamity kii meeting hui or main usamen shaamil hua tha
 Mufti Saheb used to behave lovingly in that meeting and whenever the meeting took place, we had the opportunity to eat food at his residence
 jab mufti sahab jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri bane, unhone pidipi kaa gathan kiya or 2002 main mufti sahab ke netritv main yahaan sarkaar bani
 The way in which they made the atmosphere here better, after that a large number of people from foreign countries started coming to Jammu and Kashmir, we remember all that
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki us samay kendra main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main endie kii sarkaar thi
 i was the Railway Minister in that government
 puure desh main rail vistaar ke liye jo kaam karnaa tha, maine kiya
 i remember that i came to Kashmir in 2003 and supervised the ongoing railway work
 katra se kajipur ke bich main jis prakaar kaa vah strecchar he, jitne tunnel, pul or jitani kathinaayee he, aisa railway main puure desh main nahin he
 Got a chance to see all these things
 us samay mufti sahab yahaan kemukhyamantrithe, unase mili or unhone sneh diya, pehle hi se mujhe vah maanate the
 He called me to his residence and when i went to meet him at the residence, at the same time we also met Mehbooba Mufti Sahiba
 in sabhi chizon ko ham bhuule nahin hai, hamen yaad he
 He said that this new railway network is being built, it should be built, it is a good thing, but it should be built in a short time
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jab srinagar ke railway stesan kaa kaam chal rahaa tha to mujhe acchhee tarah yaad he ki hamane kaha ki aap bhi usko ek baar dekh len or phir agle din subah main main bhi unke saath srinagar railway stesan ko dekhne gaya
 He was very happy to see him and praised me a lot
 main in baton ko kaise bhul saktaa hum
 He also took me by helicopter to Gulmarg
 nitish kumaar ne kaha mujhe aap sabake bich aane kaa mauka mila, yah mere liye gaurav kii baat he
 i got this honor to work in Bihar, but this work is not mine alone
 hamaare sahyogi up mukhmayantri susheel kumaar modi ji bhi baithe hai
 All of us are equal partners in this work
 hamaare kaam ko bihar kii janata ke har tabake kaa samarthan miltaa he
 Due to this, change has come in Bihar today
 yah sammaan jo mujhe aapane diya he, yah puure bihar kii janata kaa sammaan he
 Nitish Kumar invited Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti to come to Bihar

 in 1857 ke vidroh ke baad angrejon ko laga ki hindu or musalmaan jab tak ek rahenge, bharat main british samrajya ke liye mushkilen bani rahengi
 The problem was found by Lord Canning, the then British Governor General, who adopted the famous British diplomacy 'divide and Rule'
 hinduon or musalamaanon kii ekta khatm karne ke liye donon dharmon ko ek-duusare ke khilaaf bhadakaayaa
 Ram Janmabhoomi and Babri Masjid were also added somewhere in this campaign
 vivaad kii kahani 486 saal puraani he
 In 1528, the Mughal emperor Babur's general Mir Baqi reached Ayodhya during his conquests, where he demolished the Ram temple and built the mosque, which he named the Babri Masjid after his master
 hinduon or musalamaano ke bich yah vivaad angrezon ke liye ek hathiyaar ban gaya
 The temple-mosque dispute first reached the court in 1885
 babari masjid ke saath lagate ram chabutare par mandir nirmaan ke liye mahant raghubar das ne secretary of state for india ke khilaaf faizabad court main mukadmaa daayar kiya
 On March 18, 1886, the Faizabad District Judge passed the order, in which he wrote, "yesterday i went to the disputed land taking all sides together
" 
 
 maine paaya ki babar dwaara banaai gai masjid ayodhya kii seemaa par khadi he, yani pashchim kii taraf or dakshin kii taraf bastiyaan hai
 
 
 It is very unfortunate that the mosque was built at a place which was revered for Hindus
 
 
 lekin is ghatana ko ghate 356 saal ho chuke hai, isliye shikaayat ko sunne ke liye bahut der ho gai he
 
 
 "(court verdict, by Col
 FEA Chamier, District Judge, Faizabad, 1886) adaalat ke is faisle ne bhi donon dharmon ke bich hue vivaad ko khatm karne kii bajaae badhaane kaa hi kaam kiya
 Since the year 1949, this dispute is still going on in the court
 sainkadon dange hue, hazaron maare gaye, kai ghar barbaad hue
 Both sides have their own arguments
 
 
 hindu mandir bananaa chaahate hai, muslim masjid, or secular log skool yaa hospital bananaa chaahate hai
 Nobody wants to bow down
 ab ram janmabhumi - babari masjid maamle main babari masjid ection cameti ke vakil hashim ansaari ne donon dharmon ke bich hui duuri ko kam karne kii koshish kii
 He said that now he wants to see Ramlala free
 vah ab kisi bhi keemat par babari masjid ke mukademe kii pairvi nahin karenge
 He said that Ramlala should live in Tarpaul and people in palaces
 
 
 log laddu khaaen or ramalala ilaychi dana, yah nahin ho saktaa
 Of course, some people will welcome his decision and some will protest
 angrez chale gaye, lekin unki foot daalo or raaj karo vaali niti ko hamaare netaaon ne acchhee tarah istemaal kiya, khaskar, varsh 1985 ke baad
 Some became sympathizers of Hindus, some as leaders of Muslims, but all baked the bread of politics
 apni sahuuliyat ke hisaab se ram mandir ko apane ghoshnaptr main rakhte or hataate rahete hai
 This dispute cannot be settled by the court's decision
 nipataara tabhi hoga, jab donon dharmon ke log ek-duusare kii bhaawanaaon kaa dhyaan rakhte hue mil-baithkar baat karenge
 If both sides are able to take the same decision as Ansari, then the centuries-old dispute may end

 On 28 May 2018, Kevin's body was recovered from the river in Kollam district
 Kevin and Neenu wanted to marry, the family was not allowed to caste Kevin
 Neenu's brother was also among the accused, his father was acquitted for lack of evidence
 Kevin Joseph of Kerala In the murder case, the Principal Sessions Court of Kottayam on Tuesday sentenced all 10 convicts to double life imprisonment
 bataa den ki may 2018 main kevin joseph kaa shav kollam main mila tha
 Last week, the court convicted all 10 accused in the case
 may 2018 main kevin joseph kii hatya kar di gai thi
 The court termed the murder as honor killing
 23 varshiya kevin joseph or 21 varshiya ninu ekadusre se prem karte the or donon ne shaadi karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The girl's family objected to this relationship regarding Kevin's caste
 virodh ke baavjood donon ne shaadi karne kaa faisla liya

 acute incephelitis syndrome yani chamaki bukhaar kaa koi ilaaj nahin he
 It is unfortunate that despite all the efforts and research, no such medicine could be made which could cure the suffering patients
 yahaan tak ki abhi tak is beemaari ke peeche ke virus kii bhi pahchaan nahin ho saki he
 This is how a vaccine can be formed to treat acute encephalitis syndrome (AES)
 mujffarpur or aasapaas ke ilaakon main bacchon main ye beemaari may se shuru hokar july tak chalati he
 After that it ends automatically
 barsaat ke baad yah beemaari kyon khatm ho jaati he, ye bhi ek rahasy he
 Scientists have done a lot of research on acute encephalitis syndrome, but whatever results have come out, they are not very convincing
 is beemaari ke rahasy se pardaa hataane ke liye scientiston kii ek team banaai gai
 One of the reasons that scientists have observed is that the harvest season of litchi is in this month and when the litchi starts ripening and dripping, the children go to the litchi plantation and eat the fallen litchi, it may contain virus
 lekin phir yah 6 maheene saal bhar ke bacchon ke kaise paaya ja rahaa he yah sawaal uthta he
 Prabhat Kumar Sinha, a doctor involved in the research of acute encephalitis syndrome, said that although the disease started in the nineties, it emerged as an epidemic in 2011
 unhone kaha ki saal 2011 main eies ke research par ek team ne kaam karnaa shuru kiya tha
 Under which vector billogist tests were done
 unhone bataaya ki research team ne siesuef spinal flud ke sample neshnal institute of vyrology (enaivi) pune ko bheje lekin report nakaaratmak ai
 In 2014, cases of acute encephalitis syndrome occurred on a large scale
 iske baad research team ne phir isaki khoj shuru kii jisamen siemasi vellore ke jaikab jorge (professor of pridiakatis) bhi us team main maujuud the, lekin koi thos nateeja saamne nahin aayaa
 However, at Kejriwal Hospital in Muzaffarpur, he said that children give glucose
 glucose dene se bachche marenge nahin or sachmuch glucose dene se bahut se un bacchon kii jaan batch jaati he jo samay par aspataal pahunch jate hai
 Dr
 Prabhat Kumar Sinha said that Dr
 Jacob gave a theory about acute encephalitis syndrome in which he said that this disease was first found in North Vietnam
 iske baad afridi desh jamaica main iske maamle saamne aae
 Incidentally, litchi is produced at both these places
 mujffarpur bhi lichi utpaadan ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Dr
 Prabhat says that we did research with Dr
 CP Thakur
 kuch sample bhi ikatthe kiye gaye the
 He told that our team got toxin in lychee which is the cause of blood sugar lawyer
 usase pataa chalaa ki ye bhi mauton kaa ek kaaran he
 a third point that has been revealed in the study is that when examining the urine, the amount of organophosphorus pesticide was found, which is sprayed as pesticide on the litchi crop
 doctor prabhaat kaa kahana he ki jab tak is virus kaa aaidentyphoid nahin hota tab tak vaxin nahin banaai ja sakati he
 The team of doctors is doing research on it
 research main he ki abhi tak virus aaidentiphoi nahin hua he
 He has said that people should be made aware of this

 desh ke pehle grahamantri sardaar patel ko lekar anya vivaad khadaa karte hue bhaajapa ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne ek kitaab ke hawaale se aaj aarope lagaaya ki jab patel ne swatantraaa ke baad bharat main hyderabad ke vilay ke liye sena bhejne kaa suzav diya tha to tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne unhen ‘purnat: sampradayik’ vyakti kaha tha
 Advani quotes MKK Nair's book "the Story of an Era Told Withoutout i Will" in a new posting of his blog
 is kitaab main hyderabad ke khilaaf ‘police karrwai’ se pehle hui cabinet kii baithak main nehru or patel ke bich hue ‘tikhe vaartalap’ kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 The Nizam of Hyderabad wanted to join Pakistan and also sent an envoy to the neighboring country and he also transferred a lot of money to the government there
 nizaam ke adhikari sthaneey logon par kathith rup se atyaachaar kar rahe the
 Advani quoted Nair's book as saying, "patel told about these things in a cabinet meeting and demanded that the army be sent to end the terror rule of Hyderabad
" aamtaur par vinamrata or shishtachar ke saath baat karne vaale nehru ne aapa khote hue kaha tha, aap puri tarah se sampradayik hai
 i will never accept your recommendation
 adwani ne apane blog main kaha, patel isse vichlit nahin hue, balki vah apane kagajaat lekar kamare se chale gaye
 The BJP has been trying to prove for some time that Sardar Patel was a leader who was close to the Hindutva ideology
 adwani ne 31 aktubar ko patel kii 138veen varshganth par duniya main sabase lambii 182 meter kii unki pratimaa banane kii pariyojna ke udghaatan ke maukey par desh ke is pehle grahamantri kii prashansa kii thi
 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who started the project, said that the people of India need Patel's secularism, not the "votebank secularism" prevailing these days
 adwani or modi donon ne khud ko patel kii viraasat ko aage le jane vaale netaa ke taur par pradarshit karne kii koshish kii he
 The BJP has also alleged that Congress has never praised Patel's contribution and has only praised the nehru-gandhi family
 adwani ne apane blog main likhaa ki tatkaaleen garvanar general rajaji ne hyderabad main sena bhejne ke liye nehru ko manaaya
 Rajaji called Nehru and Patel to Rashtrapati Bhavan to discuss this issue as the situation continued to worsen
 is bich sena ko yuddh ke liye taiyaar rakhaa gaya tha
 Rajaji also used a letter from the British High Commissioner during that meeting protesting the incident of raping 70-year-old nuns of a convent two days earlier by Razakars in Hyderabad
 patel ke nikat sahyogi veepi menon ne baithak ke pehle rajaji ko yah patr diya tha
 Advani said quoting the book, Rajaji described the situation in Hyderabad in his own special way
 unhen laga ki bharat kii pratishtha kii raksha ke liye is maamle par nirnay lene main or deree nahin kii jaani chahie, lekin nehru antarrashtriya parinaamon ko lekar chintit the
 Then Rajaji showed the letter of the British High Commissioner
 unhone kaha, nehru ne patr padhaa
 His face turned red, his words were not coming out due to anger
 vah apni kursi se uthe, apni mutthi ko mej par maaraa or chillaaye, hamen ek kshan bhi vyarth nahin karnaa chahie
 We will teach them a lesson
 adwani ne kaha, rajaji ne tatkaal menon se kaha ki vah yojana ke anusaar kaary karne ke liye chif commander ko suchit karen
 This feeling is all over the North East

 indian-american Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal has also surpassed the country's President Barack Obama in terms of popularity in his province
 ek taaja surveykshan kii report ke mutabik praant ke zyaadaatar log chaahate hai ki karishmai republican netaa jindal varsh 2012 main raashtrapati kaa chunaav ladane ke bajaay luiciana ke garvanar ke taur par hi kaam jari rakhen
 Jindal's work was appreciated by 55 percent voters of the province
 yah pratishat obama ko mili pratishat se 11 ank zyada he
 a statewide survey of public policy polling found that Jindal is still a favorite of people in Louisiana, despite the current ratings dropping significantly compared to the popularity gained after his first year as governor
 surveykshan ke dauraan logon ne 17 governron main se jindal ko tisare sthaan par rakhaa
 On the other hand, Obama has an overall negative rating in Louisiana
 obama ko pichley saal 20 navambar ko luiciana main 20 ankon se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 According to the survey, 44 percent of the voters praised his work while 50 percent rejected it
 haalanki varsh 2012 main hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav main jindal kii ummidavaari ko lekar logon ne milijuli pratikriya vyakt kii
 The results of the survey show that 61 percent of the people believe that Jindal should not try for this election while only 27 percent of the people seem to be in favor of it
 gyatavya he ki republican party main jindal kaa kad bad rahaa he or kaaphi log maanate hai ki vah varsh 2012 main hone vaale raashtrapati chunaav main ummidavaari hasil karne kii koshish kar sakate hai
 Jindal, however, denied such reports
 ganit ke kshetra main ek mahaan uplabdhi us samay hasil kii gai jab duniya bhar main ganitagyon ko kareeb ek sau saal se uljhaae rakhane vaala mahaan ganitagya shrinivas ramanujam kaa ganit kaa siddhant sulajhaa liya gaya or vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki isse blike hole ke vyavhaar jaise jatil prashnon ko hal kiya ja saktaa he
 Ramanujam, a mathematical genius who traveled from the world at the young age of 32, was on death row in 1920
 tabhi unhone apane guru evam british ganitagya ji ech hardi ko ek patr likhaa tha
 In this paper, the Indian mathematician outlined several new mathematical functions that had never been heard before
 is patr main ramanujam ne in falan ke bare main ye bhi sanket die the ki ve kaise kaam karte hai
 According to a report in the Daily Mail, the researchers said that they proved that Ramanujam's formula was correct and that the formula could also explain the behavior of "black holes"
 blike hole dik-kaal kaa ek kshetra tha jahaan se gurutwaksharn prakaash samet kisi bhi cheez ko nikalne nahin detaa
 Mathematician Ken Ono of Emory University said, 'we have solved the problems of his last letters full of mysteries
 ganit ke is kshetra main kaam karne vaale logon ke liye yah problem 90 saal se khulaa tha
 Ono said that Ramanujam, born in a village in South India, became a mathematician by studying himself at home
 vah ganit main itnaa rame hue the or iske bare main chintan-manan karne main itnaa samay lagaate the ki kalege main do baar fail ho gaye the
 Ramanujam, in his paper, discussed several new functions that behave differently from known 'theta functions' or modular formulas but closely imitate them
 function aise sameekaran hote hai jinhen ‘sin wave’ ke samaan kisi kaksh par graph ke rup main ukera ja saktaa he or jab kisi chuninda ‘input’ yaa mulya ke liye ganan karne par koi ‘output’ de sakate hai
 Ramanujam hypothesized that his virtual modular form is similar to the common modular form identified by Carl Jacobi, and that both are summed to the same root (root) with the same output
 ono ne kaha, ‘hamane sabit kiya ki ramanujam sahi the
 We found that the formula explained one of the visions that he believed to have come from his goddess
 ’ anusandhankarta yah dekh kar dang rah gaye ki takreeban ek sau saal purana formula aaj bhi upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Ono said, 'when Ramanujam first came to his virtual modular farms, nobody discussed black holes in the 1920s, and despite that his formula could expose the mysteries about them
 ’ ramanujam kaa nidhan 26 april 1920 ko 32saal kii choti si umr main ho gaya

 isroyal ke pradhanmantri benjamin netanyahu kii mejabani ke baad 10 farvari ko pradhanmantri narendra modi philistin ke ramalla pahunchenge, jo kisi bhi bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa pehla philistin daura hoga
 Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Israel was also the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister, after this Modi's visit to Palestine is seen as severing India's relationship with both countries, which is already going on Just the opposite of tradition
 bharat lambey samay tak is kshetra main apane rishte ko balance karata rahaa he
 Modi's visit is important for India, as it will help the government to put an end to the speculation that India's Palestine policy has changed with Modi becoming Prime Minister in 2014
 haal hi main yerusalem ko isroyal kii rajdhani ke taur par manyata dene ke america raashtrapati trump ke faisle ke khilaaf sanyukt raashtra main vot karne ko philistin par bharat kii puraani niti ko barkaraar rakhane ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The schedule of Prime Minister Modi's visit to Palestine is yet to be finalized, the Times of India reported
 nai dilli sthit sarkari sutron ke mutabik jordan ke amman se modi helicopter ke jariye philistin ke ramalla ja sakate hai
 The West Bank city of Ramalla is the administrative capital of Palestine
 modi jis root se ramalla jaaenge, vah yerusalem se sirf aath kilometre kii duuri par he
 In such a situation, it is very important in the context of the policy of the government, looking at the relationship between Israel and Palestine separately
 aisi paristhitiyon main modi ke liye isroyal ko chhodana aasaan hoga, jaisaa ki unhone isroyal daure ke samay philistin ke saath kiya tha
 Let me tell you that there was a lot of disappointment in Palestine due to Modi's visit to Ramalla during the Indian Prime Minister's visit to Israel
 ramalla sthit philistin centre for policy and research centre ke diarector khalil shikaaki ne pichley saal bhartiya patrakaron or netaaon ke ek samooh se kaha tha ki bharat ke rukh ko lekar philistin main kaaphi chintaa kaa bhav he, joki 1947 se chali aa rahi apni niti se hat rahaa he
 Shikaki had said, "the current Prime Minister of India is taking more interest in security and its relationship with the West
" philistin ko ab lagane laga he ki unke paas bharat kaa samarthan nahin he
 'by voting against the US proposal to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital at the United Nations and now Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ramalla, the government is trying to convey that India's relations with Israel will not be built at the expense of Palestine
 modi sarkaar is baat ko lekar behad sachet he ki ek lambey samay tak philistin kaa samarthan bharat kii videsh niti kaa ahm hissaa rahaa he
 Explain that Modi's two joint statements with Netanyahu make no mention of India's traditional 2 state solution on the issue of israel-palestine conflict
 haalanki sarkaar ne yah bhi spasht nahin kiya he ki vah puraane rukh par kaayam he yaa nahin
 In an interview to an Israeli newspaper last year, Modi said that India believes in the 2 State Solution for the peaceful coexistence of Israel and the Palestinians
 may 2017 main philistin ke raashtrapati mahmud abbaas ke bharat daure ke samay bhi pradhanmantri ne yahi baat doharaai thi
 The incident of the exclusion of almost all Hindus, ie Kashmiri Pandits from the Kashmir Valley, has become a hallmark of the problem by itself
 kashmir kii jansankhya main kashmiri panditon kaa hissaa paanch fisadi se bhi kam hua karata tha
 In today's time, when about 5 lakh people had to be deported in their own country just because of their religion, then it should be heavy on all other issues of this issue
 yahaan yah tathy bhi jodpha hoga ki kashmiri pandit sambhavat: ek durlabh samudaay he, jisamen sakshartaa 100 fisadi or aparaadh kii dar shunya he
 There is no record of retaliation even on agitation, uproar, violence or provocation
 iske baavjood unhen samuhik rup se katl, balaatkaar, aatank or ghrinaa ke abhiyaan kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Such unjustified barbarity with peaceful people was considered so disgusting that whatever the reasons and arguments behind it, it was out of tolerance
 kareeb chauthai shatabdi ke baad yah dharmik-jaateey safai avaidhta kii aisi amit pahchaan ban gai he jo na sirf yah dikhaati he ki algaavvaadiyon ne aazaadee ke liye ladgaye waalon kaa jhootha chola odh rakhaa tha or bahusankhyak musalmaan akasar udasin tamaashai banakar isamen sahabhaagi ban jate the, balki yah bhi ki tatkaaleen sarkarein or rajnatik sanghathan, apane 'dharmanirpeksh’ bhram main fanse hue lambey samay tak aparaadhiyon ko khuli chhot dete rahe
 Today everyone wants to correct mistakes and look fresh and fresh, but the sudden spurt in activities related to this issue is indicating a hurry
 aisi jaldbaaji, jisase aise jaal main funsane kii ashanka he ki jaruri masalon ke badale gaiyr-jaruri masalon par charchaa shuru ho jaae
 The first question is why Kashmiri Pandits were excluded? Is sending Kashmiri Pandits back in the valley a solution to this problem? Will not the 'packaged packages' keep the apprehensions, wrong treatment of the disease often increases the merge? The apparent contradiction in the last 66 years is that secular India has carried forward the communal agenda in Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir main islam kii vakaalat karne vaale bina janamat sangrah kiye ek samjhauta patr ke jariye kashmir ko bhartiya sangh se jhatakane kii baat karte hai
 Or see it as a historical grace on Hindu India
 sach to yah he ki donon kaa mul makasad ek hi he
 Keeping Jammu and Kashmir a geographical area of the separatist agenda
 anuchhed 370 aisi yojana ko jaruri oxigen muhaiyaa karata he, varanaa vahaan ke samaaj ko itane bade paimaane par kattarpanth kii raah par banaae rakhana mushkil hota
 Apart from the Valley, discrimination with other areas, marginalizing people of other identities like Gujjars, Bakarwals, hills, Shias, Sikhs, Buddhists, culminated in the expulsion of Kashmiri Pandits
 yah darasal anuchhed 370 kaa hi dirghakaalik nateeja he
 Even today, Article 370 is helping the separatists in the belief that whatever pluralistic, liberal and patriotic society is left, radical Wahhabi can be converted into separatist Stone Age society
 bijepi shuru se hi is masale ko uthaati rahi he or vah lagaataar iske saath khadi rahi he
 Jaya Sangh founder president Shyama Prasad Mukherjee died in the mysterious death of Sheikh Abdullah in prison in Srinagar in 1953
 unhen us avivekpurna kanoon kii avagya ke liye giraftaar kiya gaya tha, jisane bhartiya sangh main ek tarah se do desh bana die the
 Jammu and Kashmir was provided with a separate flag, a separate constitution and a separate prime minister
 phir 1990 main jab hinduon ko ghati ke unke gharon se baahar nikaal diya gaya, tab ek baar phir is masale ko uthaane main bijepi aage rahi
 Article 370 has been an issue since the nineties that has separated BJP from the rest of the parties
 aam chunaav ne is party ko vah mahatvapurn sankhya di he, jo iske pehle vaajapeyi sarkaar ko bhi mayssar nahin thi
 The decisive phase that was needed to resolve the Kashmir issue is present today
 to, jammu-kashmir main kya karnaa chahie? sabase pehle to har kahin bina kisi apwaad ke har tarah ke kattarpanthi sanghathanon par nakel kasi jaae, jo bahul, udaaravaadi or sahishnu samaaj ke bharat ke mul vichaar par sawaal uthaate hon
 After this, an open public discussion should be held on Article 370
 jammu-kashmir kaa rajnatik punargathan kiya jaae taaki yah ghati kaa upnivesh banakar na rahe
 Equally important is that action should be taken against those who persecuted against Kashmiri Pandits
 pichley kai dashakon main tahas-nahas kiye gaye or kabja kiye gaye saikadon mandiron or tirth sthanon kaa jirnoddhar kiya jaae
 Safe and sustainable environment and area should be created for rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits
 kashmir ko kattarpanth kii raah par dhakelnaa kisi fatve se nahin hua he, usee tarah use us raste se hataane main bhi kuch ghoshnaaen hi kaaphi nahin hongi
 At least for this, a few decades of stable political system, healthy education system, professional police system, justice system strictly dealing with terror and western neighbor will have to realize that it is not easy to create trouble here
 ye baaten pehle fantasy jaisi lagati thim lekin narendra modi ko mili janadesh ke baad sthitiyaan badal gai hai
 Sushil Pandit is the exiled Kashmiri Pandit and publisher of Prajnath, a magazine related to the culture and identity of Kashmir
 naksali ilaakon main jaan ko jokhim main daalkar kisi bhi oparation ko CRPF ke jawan anjaam dete hai, par in javaanon kaa kaal naksal oparation se zyada heart atake, dengue, malaria or aatmahatya ban rahaa he
 The Home Ministry has made a shocking disclosure in its written reply to the Rajya Sabha

 In 2015-16, 903 soldiers died due to heart attack, malaria, dengue, depression and suicide
 grih mantralay kii report ke mutabik jahaan 2015 main heart atake, malaria, dengue or depressant ke chalate 407 CRPF ke javaanon kii maut hui to 2016 main in mauton kaa aankada badhkar 476 ho gaya he
 BS FK DG KK Sharma said during the work shop, 'recent studies have proved that more number of members of these forces are killed due to illnesses than those who are martyred while performing Operation Duties
 unhone kaha ki seemaa suraksha bal ke chikitsa mahanideshaalay ke aankade bataate hai ki bal main galat jivan style ke kaaran anek bimaariyaan ho jaati hai
 'recently, a report of all the paramilitary forces, it was also revealed that the death of the soldiers of the paramilitary force of the country is more due to diseases like heart attack and diabetes rather than war
 yani border yaa desh kii duusari sensitive jagahon par tainaat hamaare javaanon ko dushmano kii goliyon se nahin, balki apni kharaab sehat se unhen khatra he
 According to the report, there are 7 paramilitary forces inside the country
 jo CRPF, BSF, ITBP, SSB, CISF, NSG or assam rifl hai
 According to the report, in the last 3 years, 1067 soldiers have been martyred in different operations against terrorists
 vahiin kharaab sehat hone kii vajah se marane vaale sainikon kii taadaad kahin zyada he
 The death toll due to poor health is about 3,611

 - Hansal Mehta (@mehtahansal) February 4, 2015 bhamashah swasthya yojana ko band karne kaa faislarajya main ayushmaan bharat yojana lagu kii jaegiayushmaan bharat yojana kaa naam badalakar hoga lagurajasthan sarkaar ne ek tir se do nishaan saadhe hai
 It has been decided to discontinue the biggest Bhamashah health scheme implemented during the Vasundhara government
 ise band karne ke peeche tark diya gaya he ki centre sarkaar kii ayushmaan bharat yojana lagu kii jaaegi, magar gahalot sarkaar ne rajasthan main lagu hone vaali centre sarkaar kii ayushmaan bharat yojana kaa naam badal diya he
 In Rajasthan, the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious scheme has been changed to Ayushman Bharat Mahatma Gandhi Health Scheme
 satta main aane ke baad se hi gahalot sarkaar vasundhara raaje ke sabase badi yojana bhamashah swasthya yojana ko band karnaa chaahati thi, magar isaki lokapriyata ko dekhte hue faisla nahin liya ja rahaa tha
 Significantly, during the BJP rule, Vasundhara Raje had refused to implement the Ayushman Bharat scheme of the Center, saying that more people are covered in the Bhamashah Yojana, while many people will fall out of its scope if the Ayushman Bharat scheme is implemented
 
 jab congress kii sarkaar rajasthan main ai to ayushmaan bharat yojana kaa card post offis ke jariye logon ke ghar tak bheja jane laga
 It was said from the Congress that we will not allow its political use
 magar ab rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne donon se nipatane kaa rasta nikaal liya he or rajya main 1 sitambar se bhamashah yojana band kar uski jagah ayushmaan bharat mahatma gandhi swasthya yojana lagu karne kaa elaan kiya he
 At the same time, Rajasthan Medical Minister, Dr
 raghu sharma ne bataaya, "is naam se yah kaam rajasthan main 1 sitambar se prarambh hoga
 About one crore 10 lakh families will be benefited in this and i understand that the department has been prepared
 yah rajasthan kii avam ke liye ek bahut bada faisla he
 "significantly, during the election, Health Minister Raghu Sharma had said in a full meeting that if the Congress comes to power, the health card made by Vasundhara Raje will break Bhamashah
 ise lekar bijepi ne kii dhamkee di thi ki congress main himmat he to bhamashah yojana band karke dikhaae
 Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has been calling the Bhamashah Health Scheme a big scam of the state
 swasthya mantri raghu sharma ne kaha he ki donon ko milajulakar ayushmaan bharat mahatma gandhi swasthya yojana banaaya jayega, taaki rajya main koi bhi vyakti is yojana se baahar nahin ja sake
 All those who are taking benefit of Bhamashah Health Scheme will get a place in Ayushman Bharat Mahatma Gandhi Health Scheme
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne party ke bijepi ke saath haath milaane ko lekar safai di he
 The party's mouthpiece 'saamana' in its editorial, Uddhav Thackeray, till recently has been making sharp attacks on the BJP and Modi government, through which Uddhav Thackeray spoke about a renewed alliance with the BJP
 bataa den ki mangalvaar ko mumbai main bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ke elaan ke baad se hi shivasena pramukh soshal media par trol kiye ja rahe the
 Here are 5 important things about the long and wide editorial written in Saamana - BJP President Amit Shah himself came to Matoshree and in front of him, Shiv Sena strongly advocated in 'thackeray Style'
 - bijepi ke saath gathbandhan naa to palaayan or naa hi laachaari
 It will be known tomorrow in which direction the wind is blowing in the country but the 'wind' has turned towards us
 hawa aegi isliye hamane peeth nahin dikhaai
 History must enter it
 philhal itnaa hi
 The sword has a sharp edge and the Shiv Sena sword is not 'sheathband'
 - 2014 main bhaajapa se vidhivat algaav ke baavjood phir ek kaise hue? ram mandir banegaa kya? shivasena kaa mukhyamantri banegaa kya? aise kai sawaal hai or unke uttar sakaaratmak hai
 - a trusted partner like Nitish Kumar has also left the 'NDA' twice
 raajnneeti main phir saath aane ke liye kuch aam shabd kahe jate hai jaise ki ‘rashtriya vyapak hit’, ‘janhit’ or ‘janata kii ichha’
 According to this wish, the Congress can have a grand alliance and Nitish Kumar etc
 can come in the NDA, then the Shiv Sena is the equal share of this NDA
 - 2019 kii sthiti aisi he ki yah chunaav lahar par nahin balki vichaar, kaam or bhavishya par ladanaa he
 Rahul Gandhi's progress book has improved compared to 2014
 sahaayta ke liye priyanka gandhi hai lekin unki tulana modi ke netritv se nahin kii ja sakati
 It has also been written in the editorial that the Shiv Sena carried forward the organization by paying the cost of blood flowing with a backache, it is not an escape nor helplessness, no manipulation at all
 america ke videsh mantralay kaa kahana he ki vah bharat main naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke maamle par bariki se najar rakh rahaa he
 It has also appealed to the protesters to abstain from violence and to protect and respect the rights of peaceful demonstrations from the administration
 america videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne news agency eenai se kaha, 'ham log naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ke maamle par bariki se najar rakh rahe hai

 At the same time, there were protests in several parts of the country on Monday against the police action and the controversial Citizenship (amendment) Act in Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia
 pradarshan kaa samarthan netaa or saamaajik kaaryakarta bhi karte najar aae
 At some places, these demonstrations were peaceful, while elsewhere it took violent form

 The impact of police action against Jamia students and anger against citizenship law was seen from Uttar Pradesh to Kerala and Maharashtra to West Bengal
 jamiya ke chaatro par police kii karrwai ke khilaaf congress ke netritv main vipaksh ekajute ho gaya
 Apart from the Congress, leaders of four other political parties held a joint press conference and demanded a Supreme Court judge to investigate the events in the Jamia campus on Sunday evening

 co / i3e7uckcis— Bigg Boss (@biggboss)november 3, 2016 BJP has strongly attacked Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after the report of the three-member inquiry committee in the DDCA case
 ravivaar ko bijepi ke pravaktaa emje akbar ne press conference main kaha ki jaanch report main vitt mantri arun jetali kaa kahin bhi naam nahin he
 Delhi CM Kejriwal should apologize to Jaitley in the entire matter
 bijepi pravaktaa ne kaha, 'jaanch report main kahin bhivitt mantri arun jetalika naam nahin he
 We have already said that he is impeccable and false accusations have been leveled against him
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko chahie ki vah vitt mantri se maafee maange or court jaakar manahani ko sweekaar karen
 MJ Akbar further said that the Aam Aadmi Party is now making weak arguments that this investigation was not about any individual
 emje akbar ne dilli ke mukhyamantri ko nishane par lete hue kaha, 'aapane har tareeke se jaanch kar lee
 Now it is time that you apologize to Jaitley
 ' unhone aage kaha, 'jis file par kejariwal ne saare hamalon kaa aadhaar banaaya, uski sachai saamne aa gai he
 It has become clear that there is no allegation nor name against Arun Jaitley
 'congress ke bahaane AAP par nishanabijepi netaa ne kaha ki 12 march 2013 kii report main isi tarah congress ne koshish kii thi, lekin rirpot main kaha gaya kijetli ke khilaafatinakaa bhar bhi kuch nahin he
 Nothing has been revealed in the report dated 15 November 2015
 kejariwal ko chahie ki vah court main jaakar bhi galati maanakar kahen ki manahani hui he
 'government does not run with spectacle' MJ Akbar attacked the Delhi government, saying that the government is not manipulated by showing spectacle
 jetali ne koi galati nahin kii or arvind kejariwal ne har galati kii he
 On the question of the letter of Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia to the CBI director, Akbar said, "this is a new lie to divert from the main issue
" ' bataa den ki dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne sibiai diarector ko ek chitthee likhakar kaha ki agency se kuch durbhaavnapurna jaankariyaan li kii ja rahi he or dilli sarkaar ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh rachi ja rahi he
 Kejriwal tweeted: On the other hand, after the investigation report, Arvind Kejriwal has put his side on Twitter after seeing the aggressive attitude of BJP
 kejariwal ne likhaa ki bijepi or 'aap' main yahi fark he ki aap jahaan sabooton ke aadhaar par karrwai karti he, bijepi bhrashtachar kaa saath detii he or jaanch se bhaagti he
 Thats the difference betn BJP n AAP
 AAP takes strong n swift action on credible evidence
 BJP defends corruption n runs away from inv— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal) December 27, 2015interesting to see how some media houses are desperately trying to prove Jaitley ji innocent
 Why is Jaitley ji afraid of facing enquiry?— Arvind Kejriwal (@arvindkejriwal)december 27, 2015bijepi se kisi ne jaanch kii baat nahin kii: ashutosham aadmi party ke netaa ashutosh ne didisie maamle par kaha ki bijepi ke log 12 dinon se arun jetali ko clinit de rahe hai, lekin kisi ne bhi nahin kaha ki is par jaanch karvaa lijie
 The AAP leader said, 'BJP has now brought a new language that until their leaders are caught on camera in the corruption case, it does not consider it corruption
 'jhooth bolnaa AAP kii aadat: shrikrant sharmazaanch report aane ke baad bijepi netaa shrikant sharma ne kaha ki aam aadmi party ko jhooth bolne kii aadat he
 He said, 'the people of Delhi now hate Kejriwal who are just not making false allegations

 aam aadmi party (aap) kii punjab or goa main karaari haar ne dilli nagar nigam ke chunaav main uske liye chunauti badha di he
 In the forthcoming Municipal Corporation elections to be held on 23 April, you are getting the challenge of the opposing parties, along with the angry groups who have either left the party or have left the party or remain in the party
 Are delivering
 ek taraf aap sanyojak arvind kejariwal se aap ke chande kaa pichley ek saal se hisaab maang rahe party ke purv netaa munish rayjada satyagrah ke naam par mushkilen khadi kar rahe hai, vahiin aap se alag party 'swaraj india' banane vaale yagendra yadav sabhi 272 ward main apane ummidavaar utaar kar aap kii raah main rode atka rahe hai
 Apart from this, about half a dozen angry mlas of AAP are also working to increase the loss of AAP by staying within the party
 inamen mantri pad se hathaaye gayi aseem ahamed, sandip kumaar or jitendra singh tomars ke alaava swaraj india kheme kaa saath de rahe vidhayak pankaj pushkar or karnal devendra saharaavat shaamil hai
 In the Punjab elections, Dr
 who had done a lot of damage by campaigning intensely against AAP
 rayjada ne bataaya ki unka makasad aap ko chunavi nuksaan pahunchaana nahin he
 Rather, the basic motive of anti-corruption has been to bring the lost party to the right path
 unhone mana ki chunaav dar chunaav vah kejariwal se chande kaa hisaab maang kar dabaav banane kii ranneeti jarur apana rahe hai lekin yah bhi sahi he ki mul siddhanton se bhatak chuki party se asantushton kaa aankada punjab ke baad teji se badha he
 Most of these disgruntled corporations are ticket contenders in the elections, whose claims were rejected due to ticket purchasers
 tippaniyan Kejriwal, however, has said beyond doubt that the transparency of donations received by AAP is said that every paisa is accounted for on the party's website
 asantusht guton se party ko chunaav main sambhavit nuksaan ke sawaal par unki daleel he har seat par tikat sirf ek vyakti ko mil saktaa he
 In such a situation, it is normal for some claimants to be angry

 Now their own are questioning them

 On the one hand, AAP is making troubles in the name of former party leader Munish Raizada Satyagraha for the past one year from Arvind Kejriwal for aap's donations, while Yagendra Yadav, who created 'swaraj India', a separate party from AAP, all 272 wards i am stuck in the way of AAP by taking down your candidates

 Raizada said that his motive is not to harm AAP
 balki bhrashtachar virodh ke mul makasad se bhatak chuki party ko sahi raah par laana he
 He admitted that he is adopting a strategy to pressurize Kejriwal by asking for the account of donations, but it is also true that the number of dissidents from the party which has lost its core principles has increased rapidly after Punjab
 inamen se adhiktar asantusht nigam chunaav main tikat ke daavedaar hai jinka daawa tikat ke khariddaaron ke kaaran khaarij ho gaya
 The comments kejariwal haalanki aap ko mil rahe chande kii paardarshita ko andeh se pare bataate hue kah chuke hai ki ek ek paise kaa hisaab party kii website par chaspa he
 His argument on the question of possible loss to the party from disgruntled groups is that only one person can get a ticket on every seat

 In such a situation, there is no scope for confusion in public about the difference between Kejriwal's words and actions

 Cool Captain Dhoni, when i did not even know how many balls are in an over of a cricket match, it was nice to have a player with long hair with big hair
 2006 main pakistan ko haraane ke baad parvej musharraf ne bhi uske bade baalo ko lekar apni deewangi jaahir karte hue bal na katwane kii salaah de di thi
 But the real fun came when that player got his hair cut as soon as he returned to India
 musharraf kii baat apane dimag main set kiye baalo kaa nayaa luk dekhte hi mujh jaise tamaam skool main padhane vaale ladakon kaa 22 inch kaa seenaa khushi se phool gaya tha
 It was felt that this fellow should be the PM of the country
 mizaaj to aisa hi hona chahie akkhad or manamaujee
 But that man had to become India's most charismatic captain
 mahendra singh dhoni bananaa tha
 But now the same Dhoni has said goodbye to Test cricket, the oldest format of sudden cricket
 mere alaava puraa desh aaj kuch dukhi sa he kyonki tumse lagaav kuch zyada hi ho gaya tha
 But it seems easy to tell you the words of your mind at this moment
 shukriya dhoni, bina koi tamaasha khadaa kiye test cricket ko alavida kehane ke liye
 Glad to know that just as you had suddenly spread sensation in cricket, in the same way, you said goodbye to Test cricket suddenly
 aise daur main jab cricket ke bhagwaan ko sahuuliyat bhari vidaai dene ke liye apni jameen par 'kamjor team' ke saath siries bisisiai ne yojit kii, is daur main tumne match khatm hote hi vidaai le lee
 Although in many ways, this farewell will be unchanged to many of your fans, but in the early days with the mood with which you came, you took off from Test cricket
 greg chapel kii 'aao bahan chugali karen' daur ke baad team main jis tarah se tumne ek baar phir team or desh main bharosa paidaa kiya, ye team ke khilaadiyon samet cricket ke karodon prashansakon ko maidan se dur saaf dikhataa tha
 Thank you Dhoni for the confidence you expressed on Murali, keeping a different opinion from the whole team after Murali Vijay's poor form
 test cricket main pehle paaydaan par tumhaari captaini main pahunchnaa yakeenan tumhaari behatar captaini ko sabit karata he
 You have proved yourself in every phase of your cricket career
 50 over or paanch din tak batting karne vaale khilaadiyon ke saath tumne pehle hi tii-20 worldcup main team ke shandaar pradarshan ke saath tii-20 ke vishwa champion kaa khitaab bharat ko dilaayaa
 After winning the World Cup title, with the golden cup, you and the rest of the players were swinging in the field, the boys were not missing out on the slogans of dhoni-dhoni with red-cocked firecrackers bursting into every street corner
 jeet ke us ehsaas ko hamaare jehan main bheetar tak pahunchane ke liye shukriya dhoni
 It is a tradition and it is believed that at the time of farewell everything is said to be good
 lekin tumhaara mizaaj paramparaon se alag he or tumhaari ye vidaai abhi sirf ek tihaai hi he, isliye tumhaare prashansakon ke dil kii kuch baaten tumhaare saamne rakh hi dena chahta hum
 For some time, India's defeat on a foreign pitch was leaving many questions in the minds of your fans
 australia ke khilaaf viraat kohli kii captaini pehle match main kaabil-e-tarif thi
 Even after being aware of this, why did you like to choose captaincy in the second and third matches
 chunki prashansakon ko is baat kii khabar nahin thi ki tumhaare ye antim test match hai, iske baad bhi tumne behatar captaini kar rahe kohli se captaini khud lenaa behatar samajha
 This step of our Dhoni, who always thinks for the team, is not going down the throat of the fans anymore
 vanade team main tumhaari wicket keeping main ab wo pehle jaisi dhar dekhne ko nahin milti he
 So, will you play just like a batsman in the team
 kyonki ham jis dhoni ko jaanate the wo to aisa na tha
 You know Dhoni better than us
 lekin bataur prashansak jis 2015 ke cricket worldcup ke sapane aapane desh ko dikhaae hai, uski jimmedaari aapako yaad dilaanaa bhi jaruri ho jaataa he
 The expectations of the entire country have increased more than you now
 is baat ko dhyaan rakhiegaa dhoni ki vanade cricket worldcup australia main hi he
 Your eyes will be sharp on you
 dhoni test se vidaai ke baad ab aapako viraat kohli kii ahmiyat ko bhi achche se samajhnaa hoga
 You must have understood that Virat is a tough launderer of Delhi
 team main aapke saathi sangat khilaadiyon ko bhi is baat kaa ilm karvaa dijiega ki ab aap test cricket main nahin rahe
 Hukumat is in Kohli's hands and Kohli's mood is not like you at all
 yuvaraj kii baat to aapako yaad hogi hiki jab tak balla bolta he, tab tak hi thaath he
 It is sad that your bat will no longer be able to speak in Test cricket
 par ummid he ki vanade or cricket worldcup main tumhaara thaath usee dhoni jaisi rahegi, jo ek vigyaapan main kahata dikhataa he, kas ke pakad, jam ke jakad
 
 laga
 The decision to change the game and change the game by retiring from the test ahead of time, now you have to prove yourself right, Dhoni, the charismatic captain of Team India
 captain dhoni kaa ek prashansak

 He talked to his parents and started taking IIT coaching from the prestigious coaching center in Delhi

 But he was well aware of the competition associated with IIT-JEE

 'coaching is coming as a perfect weapon for admission to high profile courses

 Because, this city is considered as the mecca of coaching for IIT and other entrance examinations
 inke alaava ve 'asafal’ log bhi hote hai, jo dobaaraa taiyaari kar rahe hote hai or ek institute chhodkar duusare main daakhila lekar apana bhagya aajamaate hai
 Due to limited seats, the dream of all the students getting admission in iits is not fulfilled, but the number of students coming to this city to win the competition and fulfill their dreams is increasing
 kota ke koching centaron main chaatro ko salanaa 40,000 rupee se ek lakh rupee ke bich fees deni padati he
 Their fees depend on the course
 is fees ke alaava chaatro ko rahane or bhojan par har saal kam-se-kam 60,000 rupee kharch karne padate hai
 Most of the students who come here come from different parts of the country
 sikkim ke gangtok kaa 17 varshiya anuraag gulung pichley saal kota aayaa, or 16 varshiya mohammad kamran oman se yahaan aayaa hua he
 There are about three dozen coaching centers in this small town
 inamen bansal classes, ellen kariyar institute, rejonence, wibrant or kariyar point jaise kuch bade naam hai
 In 2011, South Korea's coaching company Itus opened its center in Kota
 itus academy main oversij bijness ke diarector choi yang ju kehete hai, 'videsh main iity bhartiya shiksha kaa sabase prasiddh brands he or kota iskaa centre he
 'the business of the institutes here is flourishing
 kai institute to students ko daakhila dene tak ke liye pravesh pariksha le rahe hai
 In recent years, due to increased competition among coaching centers, their entrance examinations have become easier and most centers admit all children
 1993 main kota main kariyar point kii sthapana karne vaale or iity-dilli ke student rah chuke pramod maheshwari kehete hai, 'agar ham student ko manaa karenge to vah kisi or institute main daakhila le legaa

 yah lahar is tarah uthi ki koching centaron ne iity gradupaton ko bataur adhyaaapak rakhana shuru kar diya
 Maheshwari says that in 1997 he had selected 12 faculty members through campus placements
 yah rujhaan 2002 tak jari rahaa lekin iske baad iity ne koching centaron ke campus placement main aane par roak laga di
 Today, around 35 per cent of the people associated with coaching are from IIT

 The salary of experienced teachers can be doubled

 Om Sharma, an iit-bombay student who teaches Mathematics at an institute, says, "but Itus overruled this consensus by calling 11 teachers of Resonance at a salary of around Rs 1 crore a year
" 'students ke skool se zyada koching par dhyaan dene kii vajah yah he ki ejineering kii pravesh pariksha kaksha 12veen class kii pariksha se ekadam alag hoti he
 The institutes took advantage of this opportunity and contracted the schools
 is tarah kii vyavastha main chaatr in skulon main naam to likhva lete hai, lekin class main nahin jate
 Instead, they start preparing for engineering and go to school at the time of 12th class examination
 is tarah ke sansthaanon ne apane skool khol liye hai, jahaan ve chhathi class se bacchon kaa daakhila lete hai or iity kii taiyaari karaate hai
 This year, further changes have been made in the format of entrance examination, in which 12th class board examination will be given more importance
 kariyar point ke pramod maheshwari kehete hai, 'nae formet se koching centaron par students kii nirbharta or bad jaaegi
 This will double the pressure on the students
 ve pehle pravesh pariksha ke liye koching kaa sahaara lete the
 Now they will also resort to coaching for board exams
 'ellen kariyar institute ke diarector govind maheshwari kehete hai ki kai institutes ne kota main pair jamaane kii koshish kii, lekin safal nahin hue
 Kota institutes are now opening their branches in other cities like Guwahati, Patna, Chandigarh and Bangalore
 lekin bansal kaa kahana he ki ejineering main pravesh paane ke icchhuk student kota aate rahenge
 Although no official information is available about this, people involved in the coaching business estimate that about one-fourth of the seats in iits are occupied by students from Kota
