 Akhilesh Yadav will inaugurate his dream project Lucknow Metro on December 1, but the inauguration of the Lucknow Metro will be half-incomplete at the moment as the Chief Minister promised that he would get the metro rail in Lucknow in every situation before the election
 Have to start isliye chunavi aachaar samhita ke pehle wo ise hari jhandi dikhne ja rahe hai
 Lucknow Metro Corporation has been engaged day and night to fulfill Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's election promise
 1 disambar ko udghaatan kii taarikh ko dekhte hue lakhanu metro rail corporation kii team ne somvaar der raat metro kochon ko depo se nikaalkar singaar nagarmetro steshnatak gupachup tareeke se chalaakar pre trial kar liya
 Now on December 1, CM Akhilesh will officially flag off the Lucknow Metro
 iske liye lemarsi ne sabhi taiyaariyaan puri kar lee he
 The successful trial run of the metro took place from Alambagh depot to Transport Nagar
 takreeban 5 se 6 kilometre kaa ye trial kiya gaya
 All the senior officers of LMRC were present in the trial and the technical team tested the metro trial
 haalanki 1 disambar ko udghaatan to ho jayega, lekin uske baad bhi metro shuru nahin hoga balki abhi kai stesan kaa kaam baaki he or pehali public metro daudane main abhi chah maheene kaa vakt lag saktaa he
 High-capacity mass transit system ie Lucknow metro has been finalized for the city to reduce congestion on the roads
 lakhanu main jameen par ek kimi metro par 15 karod ru kaa kharch aayega, vahiin bhumigat line main yah badhkar 27 karod ho jayega
 Metro plans are proposed in several cities in UP
 lakhanu or kanpur main metro rail shuru hone ke baad sadakon par bheed kaaphi kam ho sakegi
 Currently, about 1 thousand new four-wheelers are being registered every month in these two cities
 lakhanu main sabhi rashtriya rajmargon par bypass bana die jane ke baavjood sadakon par gadiyon kaa dabaav badhata hi ja rahaa he
 For this reason, the metro has become necessary here
 lakhanu shahar main chaar margo par ye metro ban rahi he:-amausi se kursi maarg-bada imambada se sultanpur maarg-pijiai se rajajipurmaur hajratganj se faijabaikhilesh sarkaar ne lakhanu or noida ke alaava kanpur, gajiabad, ilahabaad main metro rail chalaane kii yojana banaai he

 It is believed that the Chief Minister who held his government program in Noida loses power
 ab tak akhilesh yadav bhi noida jane se bachate rahe he
 Although the Chief Minister has given many plans for Noida, he has been inaugurating and laying the foundation stone for all
 aise main ye dekhnaa dilachasp he ki akhilesh noida main metro kii sawari kaa lutf uthaate hai ki nahin
 There are different ways of praying to us, sometimes with simple words, sometimes with kirtan and sometimes with mantras
 iname mantra sabase zyada prabhaavshaalee maanate jate hai , kyonki ye man ko turant ekagra kar dete hai or sheeghra prabhaav dete hai
 Each mantra produces different effects and power, so different types of garlands are used to chant the mantra
 aisa karne se alag alag mantron kii shakti kaa laabh mil saktaa he
 Malaka is also used so that there is no error in chanting the mantra
 maala main lage huye daanon ko manakaa kaha jaataa he
 Normally there are 108 beads in the garland but sometimes there are 24 or 56 beads in it
 maala ke prayog kii saavdhaaniyaan or niyam kya hai ?- maala ke manakon kii sankhya kam se kam 27 yaa 108 honi chahie
 There must be a knot after every bead
 - mantra jap ke samay tarjani anguli se maala kaa sparsh nahin hona chahie saath hi sumeru kaa ulanghan bhi nahin hona chahie
 - At the time of chanting the mantra, the garland should be covered with a cloth or it should be in Gomukhi
 - mantra jaap karne ke purv haath main maala lekar prarthana kerani chahie ki maala se kiya gaya mantra jaap safal ho 
 - The rosary should always be personal, the garland of another should not be used
 - jis maala se mantra jaap karte hai , use dhaaran nahin karnaa chahie
 It is considered to be a garland of prosperity and peace - Mantras of Maa Saraswati and Maa Lakshmi are best to be chanted with this garland - It is also good to wear a garland of rhinestones for wealth and concentration
 Mala is used - Turmeric garland is used for the mantras of Jupiter Dev and Maa Bagalamukhi
 You can also chant the chants of recovery, there are two types of garland - garland of sandalwood - red chandan and white chandan - chanting the chants of the goddess with a garland of red sandal is fruitful - white chandan for the mantras of Lord Krishna You can use the garland of Tulsi - this garland has the most importance in the Vaishnav tradition - chanting the mantras of Lord Vishnu and his incarnations are done with this garland
 Is it should of course follow the Vaishnava tradition on holding rosary beads basil bhartiya antariksh anusandhan sanghathan (isro) kii madad se ramalala kii suraksha vyavastha ko or hitech kiye jane kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Under this, fresh work has been started on the no-flying zone to provide a strong protective shield to Ramlala
 iske liye suraksha tantra digital map banavaa rahaa he
 After the terrorist attack on Ramlala campus of Ayodhya on 5 July 2005, the Central Government approved the plan to create a digital map
 isamen adhigrahit parisar (red jone) evam adhigrahit parisar se sata bahari ilaake (yalo jone) kii nigaraanee bhi shaamil thi
 The cost of this scheme was then kept at around five lakh rupees
 lekin ab isaki laagat 20 lakh rupee tak ho gai he
 It is said that in the meeting of the Standing Committee on Security of the recently acquired premises, the issue of surveillance was thoroughly consulted, the digital map was also discussed in detail
 is samiti ko rajya sarkaar se map kharidne ke liye sweekruti kaa intjaar he
 Although the process of purchasing its software is underway
 karmchaariyon ko is silsile main prashikshan bhi di ja chuki he
 The authorities are not ready to give information about this, because the system is connected to the acquired premises, but they accept so much that all the proposals related to the security of the premises are being implemented
 sutara bataate hai ki sthaayee suraksha samiti kii baithak main no-flying jone va digital map nirmaan kii pragati par kaaphi vichaar-vimarsh kiya gaya he
 Just waiting to buy digital map
 sutron ke mutabik, is map (nakshe) se adhigrahit parisar ke aas-paas hone vaale nirmaan va anya gatividhiyon par bhi najar rakhi ja sakegi, jo suraksha kii drushti se jaruri he
 Manoj Tiwari, MP from Delhi and Bhojpuri superstar has been appointed the new President of Delhi BJP, Manoj Tiwari will replace Satish Upadhyay
 iske kayaas aise to kai maheenon se chal rahi thi lekin muhar mangalvaar ko raat kareeb 8 baje lagi or amit shah ne ise manjuuri di
 Delhi BJP leader Pawan Sharma was also involved in the race for the post of president, but Manoj Tiwari was eventually elected
 darasal aam aadmi party ke sarkaar banane ke baad dilli ke mukhyamantriaravind kejarivallgataar jis tarah se centre sarkaar par nishaanaa saadh rahi he usase rokane main dilli bijepi naakaam sabit ho rahi thi aise main bijepi ko aise netaa kii talash thi jisaki janata main pahchaan ho
 After which Manoj Tiwari's name cropped up but the crisis was about how Manoj Tiwari is new in BJP, how can the responsibility of the organization be given
 isi baat ko lekar bijepi main uhapoh kii sthiti thi, lekin ant main aap ko counter karne ke liye manoj tiwari ko chhodkar doosraa koi nami cheharaa nahin tha saath hi purvaanchali voters ko bhi apane saath khinch sakate he
 The biggest challenge before Manoj Tiwari is to get the BJP to win the MCD elections in the early month of 2017
 harshavardhan, vijay goyal rahe maujuudghoshnaa hone ke teen ghante ke bheetar hi manoj tiwari ne adhyaksh kii kursi sambhaal bhi lee, is dauraan party ne isi baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa ki party main ekajutata dikhe, isliye manoj tiwari kii tajposhi ke dauraan mantri harshavardhan, vijay goyal sahit sabhi saansadon ko maujuud rakhaa gaya
 The appointment of Manoj Tiwari is seen as a step to woo the Purvanchali voters in Delhi, as Purvanchalis, who hail from UP and Bihar in Delhi, have a significant number who play a decisive role in the elections
 mana ja rahaa he ki vaisya samaaj se da harshavardhan or vijay goyal pehle hi centre sarkaar main mantri banaae gaye hai, aise main tiwari kii niyukti se purvaanchali samaaj ko saadhane kii koshish bijepi ne kii he
 BJP got a celebrity face as president as well to meet Arvind Kejriwal
 adhyaksh pad sanbhaalane ke turant baad manoj tiwari ne kaha ki unki koshish dilli ke logon kaa bharosa jeetne kii hogi, kyonki kejariwal ne bade-bade vaade karke dilliwaalon ko dhokhaa diya he
 He said that he is of soft nature, but will fight the battle of Delhi people with full warmth
 haalanki achaanak hue is badlaav se dilli bijepi ke netaaon main kuch baicheni bhi dikhi, charchaa is baat kii bhi he ki celibrity cheharaa jarur adhyaksh pad par kabiz hua he, lekin sanghathan ke lihaaj se tiwari kaa anubhav kaaphi kam he
 Also, his association with the party is not very old
 saansad pravesh verma ne to apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat main hi ye kah daalaa ki unki manoj tiwari se mulaakaat teen saal puraani he, yahi baat manoj tiwari ke liye ab badi chunauti hogi, kyonki emsidi ke chunaavon main sirf teen maheene kaa hi samay he

 Taiwan, Vietnam, Philippine, Malaysia and Brunei have asserted their claim to the islands
 yah puche jane par ki kya unhone china ke sainya jamaavade main koi kami dekhi he to admiral equilino ne kaha, ‘maine kshetra main deshon par dhauns jamaaye jane ko lagaataar dekha he
 i have seen islands or reefs turning and militarized into man-made islands, while the conversation is about defensive purposes
 ' unhone kaha, ‘ve kshetra main sabhi deshon- hamaare sahyogiyon, mitron- ko chunauti dete hai or unhen dhamkaate hai, lekin un dwipon se kisi bhi tainaati ko nahin hataaya gaya he
 So i would say that there has been no reduction in deployment and there is increased pressure from China only to achieve its objectives in the entire region

 ) After the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) drew support from the government, Jharkhand Chief Minister Arjun Munda has written a letter to Governor Syed Ahmed, asking him to dissolve the assembly
 arjuna munda ne rajyapal ko likhi chitthee main kaha he ki rajya main phir se chunaav hone chahie
 Munda made this announcement after the cabinet meeting
 unhone saaf kar diya he ki bijepi kisi bhi surat main jeemem ko satta nahin saunpegi
 Earlier on Monday, after the jmm's announcement of withdrawal of support from the Munda government, the Munda government came to a minority
 jeemem netaa mangalvaar ko rajyapal se milakar samarthan vaapasi kii chitthee saunpenge
 World-renowned for political instability, Jharkhand is once again on the verge of power change for the eleventh time after witnessing eight political governments and two presidential rule rounds in the last twelve years
 rajya main raashtrapati shashan lagu ho yaa jodtod kii raajnneeti ke tahat koi anya mukhyamantri bane yaa phir nae sire se chunaav hon, har haal main 11veen baar satta parivartan lag rahaa he
 Since the formation of the state in Jharkhand in the year 2000, where Chief Minister Arjun Munda took over as the Chief Minister for the third time this time, his Guru and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Shibu Soren has also held power here only three times but it has never been longer
 Could not play innings
 unke alaava yahaan madhu kodaa or babulal marandi ne bhi ek-ek baar mukhyamantri pad ko sushobhit kiya he
 While Madhu Koda formed the government in Jharkhand with the support of Congress and RJD from 2006 to 2008 and Birsa Munda has been lodged in jail for the last three years on coercive charges of corruption, while Babulal Marandi state in November 2000 after the formation of a new state Took power
 march, 2003 main samta party or vananchal congress ne unase samarthan waapas lekar unki sarkaar gira di thi lekin bijepi netaa rajnath singh ne us samay marandi ko hataakar munda ne netritv main rajya main nayi sarkaar kaa gathan kiya tha jisase marandi naaraaz ho gayi the or baad main unhone 2007 main bijepi kaa daaman chhod diya or jharkhand vikaas morcha kaa gathan kiya
 After the formation of the hung assembly in the second assembly elections held in 2005, once again Shibu Soren became the Chief Minister for nine days, a new government was formed here under the leadership of Arjun Munda but that too was given by the Congress to Madhu Koda Stood ahead and dropped in September 2006 and then formed a government under the leadership of Koda
 baad main 23 maah ke apane kaarykaal main kodaa ne jo gul khilaaye vah sabhi jaanate hai or aaj bhi vah or unke kuch sahyogi bhrashtachar ke bade aaropon main jail kii hawa kha rahe hai
 On 27 August 2008, Shibu Soren assumed power for the second time as Chief Minister in the state following the fall of Koda's government
 lekin vidhansabha kaa chunaav na jeet sakane par unhen 12 janvari, 2009 ko istipha dena padaa or phir 19 janvari, 2009 ko jharkhand main pehali baar raashtrapati shashan lagu karnaa pakadaa varsh 2009 ke ant main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main phir se rajya main trishanku vidhansabha kaa gathan hua
 Shibu Soren once again took over the state power in collaboration with the BJP on 30 December 2009 after the notification of the formation of the assembly on 23 December, but in April 2010, the UPA government opposed the bjp's cut proposal on the Union Budget in the Lok Sabha
 Shibu took up support by supporting the BJP and due to this, on 24 May 2010, the BJP withdrew support from his government and dropped it
 kisi ke bhi sarkaar banane ke liye aage na aane par ek baar phir yahaan raashtrapati shashan lagu hua or 11 sitambar, 2010 ko jeemem ke bina shart samarthan ke hi yahaan arjuna munda ke netritv main vartmaan sarkaar kaa gathan hua tha
 Announcing the withdrawal of his support from this government too, JMM has now paved the way for the formation of the eleventh government here

 shakeel ahamed ne is baat par jor diya ki badali hui paristhiti main campagne kaa tarika badla he or isiilie prashanth kishor kii madad lee ja rahi he, isse zyaada kuch nahin
 It may be known that during the meeting with some journalists, Prashant Kishore had expressed the possibility of bringing forward Rahul Gandhi's face for UP
 congress party ke tamaam varisht netaa ab tak aadhikarik rup se is baat kaa sidhe taur par khandan karne se bachate nazar aa rahe hai
 When NDTV was asked about this by Rahul Gandhi himself, he too deferred the matter by saying instead of denying that you run the name of the media, you people only know
 gyaat ho ki pichley dinon khabar ai thi ki kuch patrakaron ke saath mulaakaat ke dauraan prashanth kishor ne upi ke liye rahul gandhi kaa cheharaa tak aage karne kii sambhaavna kaa izhaar kiya tha
 All the senior leaders of the Congress party have so far avoided officially refuting it directly
 khud rahul gandhi se jab NDTV ne is babat sawaal kiya tha to unhone bhi khandan karne kii jagah yah kahkar baat ko taal diya tha ki aap media vaale hi naam chalaate ho, aap log hi jaano

 tamilnadu sarkaar ne umashankar singh ko dharmik upadesh or prachaar jaisi gatividhiyon se dur rahane kaa nirdesh diya he
 He canceled his visit after receiving a letter from the government
 gauratlab he ki beete saptaah tamilnadu ke mukhya sachiv ke
 In a letter sent to Ganesikan to Umashankar, it was stated that the government has come to know that he (umashankar) is going to participate in such 'sermons and preaching' programs from January 24 to 26 in Tirunelveli, Thuttukudi and Kanyakumari

 The order of the Patiala House Court challenging the former Chief Secretary of Delhi Anshu Prakash to give him a separate lawyer has been challenged in Delhi High Court by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and some other accused related to the case
 is maamle par aaj pehali sunwayeekarte hue dilli hoicourt ne purv mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash ko notice jari kiya he
 Anshu Prakash will have to file a reply before the hearing on December 17
 purv mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash ko die gaye vishesh vakil ke patiala house court ke faisle ko kejariwal or manish sisodiya ne dilli hoicourt me is aadhaar par chunauti di he ki mukhyamantri samet baaki logon ke liye sarkaar ke niyukt kiye gaye sarkari vaqeel pairvi kar sakate hai to vahi vakidhanshu prakaash kii pairvi court main karenge to unhen kya aapatti ho sakati he
 What do they need a separate lawyer for? patiala house court ne mukhya sachiv ko vishesh vakil siddharth agarwal or ve madhukar ko purv mukhya sachiv kii ore se jirah karne kii anumati di thi
 The court had directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to appoint an additional commissioner-level officer as a prosecutor
 house court kaa aadesh yun to niyamon ke mutabik hi kiya gaya tha
 It is a rule in CRPC that if someone wants to have a private lawyer for himself, then he can get his permission in a special case
 lekin yahsaaf he ki purv mukhya sachiv anshu prakaash or dilli sarkaar ke bich main hameshaa hi bade matbhed rahe
 In such a situation, the demand for a separate lawyer was made by Anshu Prakash because he felt that the government appointed lawyers would not be able to hold their side in the court in a better way than a private lawyer could
 anshu prakaash kii daleel thi ki sarkari vakeelon par dilli sarkaar kaa dabaav he lihaaja wo nishpakshta se unke maamle main pairvi nahin kar sakate
 The Aam Aadmi Party is busy these days bombarding questions on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi instead of PM Narendra Modi
 isaki ek badi vajah april ke maheene main hone vaale nagar nigam chunaav maani ja rahi he
 One reason for the surprise of 'AAP' leaders may also be the rise of Congress voters in the recent MCD by-election
 mangalvaar ko rahul gandhi ke emsidi chunaav ke liye prachaar karne ramlila maidan pahunchane se pehle hi 'aap' netaaon ne 5 sawaal poochkar congress se jawaab maanga
 'rahul has come to Delhi like a tourist' Aam Aadmi Party leader Dilip Pandey said, " Despite having been in Delhi for 15 years in government and in municipal power for the last 20 years, the Congress party has been facing problems for the people of Delhi
 Could not overcome dilli or centre main ekasaath sarkaar hone ke baad bhi janata ne vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko shunya par samet diya tha
 At present, Rahul Gandhi has returned to Delhi again as a tourist and after giving the Congress all over the country, for the second time, he is seen giving a gift of zero to the Congress in Delhi
 'aam aadmi party ke rahul gandhi se paanch sawaal-1
 Tell the people of Rahul gandhidilli, one of the important work of his party while in MCD
 2
 Just before the election, in 2008, Rahul Gandhi's party distributed fake provisional certificates to the residents of about 1300-1400 colonies
 iske baad 895 ko hi notiphoi kiya or uske baad kaha ki ‘nahin’ baaki sab to sarkari jameenon par hai to unke maamle main badi mushkil hogi kyonki 312 coloniyaan hai profit land par hai or unako niyamit karenge
 The people of Delhi want to know whether Rahul Gandhi will apologize to his party for fooling the people of Delhi by distributing fake certificates? 3
 dilli nagar nigam main parshad bhaajapa or congress donon ke hai or jo bhi sthiti aaj emsidi kii he, wo in donon kii vajah se hi he
 The bjp-ruled MCD does not deliberately pay salaries to sweepers and then force sweepers to strike
 bijepi-congress poshit jo union hai wo is hadtaal main safai karmiyon ke dard ko in-cash karte hue kachra failaate hai, to dilli kii janata bahut pareshaan hoti he
 Rahul Gandhi will apologize to the people of Delhi for this trouble due to the garbage politics caused by the contribution of the Congress to the people of Delhi? 4
 shila dikshitalgataar kahati raheen ki bijli companiyon kaa audit nahin ho saktaa kyonki hai court kaa ste he
 Now, after the formation of the Aam Aadmi Party government, we investigated and it was found that there is no such stay
 hamane isaki jaanch shuru karwaai to iske khilaaf bijli companiyaan hai court chali gayi
 So Rahul Gandhi should tell the people of Delhi that his party wants to save the interests of power companies or protect the interests of the public? 5
 rahul gandhi se poochna chaahate hai ki 15 saal unki party rajya kii sarkaar main rahi

 mohammad hafeez 26 years ago, Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh was shaken by the presence of thousands of kar sevaks
 6 disambar, 1992 ko jai shri ram ke naare lagaate hue karsevak babari masjid ke gumbadon par chadh gaye or use jameendoj kar tent main ramalala kii murti rakh di
 But despite all the political promises and intentions, even after two and a half decades, the grand temple could not be built till date
 haalanki, babari vidhwans kii is barsi par halaat juda hai or yah taarikh jahaan shaury ke pratik ke taur par dekhi ja rahi he, vahiin vidhwans ko aparaadh bataate hue 'samvidhan bachaao' kaa naaraa bhi buland ho rahaa he
 Before the next year's general elections, the discussion about the construction of Ram temple is in full swing in the country
 maharashtra se nikalakar shivesna pramukh uddhav thakare ayodhya pahunch chuke hai or modi sarkaar ko ram mandir nirmaan kii taarikh bataane kaa ultimatum tak de chuke hai
 On the other hand, saints and saints are also more outspoken and their attitude seems stricter
 santon ke kai dhade maujuuda sarkaar ko khuli chetavanee pesh karte hue chunaav main sabak sikhaane tak kaa dambh bhar chuke hai
 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat has also clearly demanded the government to build a temple by enacting a law
 netaaon ke bhaashan se lekar santon kii sabhaaon tak, har charchaa-paricharchaa ke centre main yahi sabase jwalanth mudda he
 Meanwhile, on 6 December, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has prepared a new movement
 shaury divasayun to viechpi 1993 se har saal 6 disambar ko shaury diwas ke rup main manaane kaa daawa karti rahi he, lekin is baar sanghathan ne is maukey par nayaa andolan shuru karne kii yojana banaai he
 On 6 December, where Havan Pujan programs are held with the Dharmasabha at Karsevakapuram Ayodhya
 vahiin, sabhi jilon main mahaarati kar jiladhikariyon ko gyaapan saunpane kii bhi sanghathan kii yojana he
 VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma in Ayodhya has said that special prayers will be offered to Mother Saraswati in Ramnagari on the occasion of Shaurya Divas to help people, especially the leaders, in removing any obstacles from the path of construction of Ram temple
 unhone ye bhi bataaya ki sarv baadha mukti havan kiya jayega
 Tributes will also be paid to the kar sevaks who ate the pills
 'sharad ke mutabik, hanuman chalisa kaa paath kar ram mandir nirmaan main aa rahi baadhaon ko dur karne kii prarthana ke saath raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or rajyapal ko gyaapan likhe jaaenge or mandir nirmaan ke liye kanoon banane kii maang kii jaaegi
 That is, vhp's 'shaurya Divas' is being celebrated as a collective call before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 (photo-india today archive)samvidhan bachaao, desh bachaovihip jahaan 6 disambar ko shaury diwas ke rup main manaa rahaa he, vahiin vam dalon kaa maananaa he ki is din babari masjid giraakar samvidhan or dharmanirpekshata ke mulyon par hamalaa kiya gaya tha or sampradayik takatein hindutv kii raajnneeti ko or dhardaar banaakar satta par kabiz rahane ke sapane dekh rahi hai
 The Left parties say that the Ram temple dispute is pending in the Supreme Court, yet it is trying to spread hysteria by calling it a matter of faith
 yahi vajah he ki vam dalon ne ye din samvidhan bachaao diwas ke rup main manaane kaa nirnay liya he
 Talking of rally Hinduism organizations in Delhi on 9 December, the 26th anniversary of Babri demolition is not limited to Shaurya Day, but beyond this, the target of nationwide movement for temple construction has been kept
 kanoon banaakar ayodhya main mandir nirmaan kii maang par dilli main aagaamee 9 disambar ko viechpi ek raily bhi yojit karne ja rahi he
 In which a large number of saints and saints will participate and demand to make laws for the temple
 ramlila maidan main hone vaali is raily main deshbhar se logon ko bulaayaa gaya he, jiske liye prantiy str se lekar block str tak do hajaar se zyada baithak kii ja chuki hai
 Even going door to door, support is being raised for the temple
 is raily main paanch lakh logon ko jutaney kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he
 VHP international joint secretary Surendra Jain has informed that after the December 9 rally in Delhi, in view of the nationwide public interest in favor of temple construction, the views of all parties will change that the temple should be built through law and all parties in Parliament will support it
 
 haalanki, supreme court kaa faisla aane tak is sambandh main kanoon banane jaisi kisi bhi sambhaavna ko sarkaar or sattarudh bijepi kii taraf se spasht taur par inkaar kiya ja chukaa he
 Despite this, the VHP and RSS are constantly demanding legislation
 yahaan tak ki vihip ne is masale par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se samarthan maangane kii bhi baat kahi he
 is
 saath hi ye bhi spasht kah diya he ki agar dilli kaa prayaas asafal ho jaataa he to agle saal prayag kumbh main 31 janvari or ek farvari ko yojit hone vaali dharm sansad main is maamle par antim faisla kiya jayega
 That is, to start the efforts of Ram temple construction by demolishing the mosque on 6 December 1992, the battle is being started to finalize from this day in 2018

 rajasthan ikai ne saaf kaha ki prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ke khilaaf aaropon kii party ke lokapal admiral ramdaas ke jariye jaanch karwaai jaani chahie thi
 The action should have been taken out of the Political Affairs Committee only after the Lokpal report, but the way the two big leaders of the party were shown the way out was objectionable

 According to them, Pankaj pressurized the Rajasthan unit
 paarikh ne aarope lagaate hue kaha he ki pradesh ke sanyojak ashok jain is meeting main shaamil hone main sakasham nahin the, lihaaja unhone mujhe piesi main unka paksh rakhane ko kaha
 Rajasthan unit was not in favor of removing Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav through voting, but despite this, the party's national secretary Pankaj Gupta himself voted for the meeting by electing a representative from the state to oust them
 rajasthan ikaike netaa yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke khilaaf khulkar maidan main utar aae hai
 According to him, some people in the party run
 ye log 2013 ke dilli vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad party se upar se jud gaye hai
 Apparently, lakhs of activists associated with the first day feel cheated
 kaaryakartaaon ko isbaat kaa malaal he ki haal main shaamil hue log 4 saal se party ke saath jude logon par haaavee kaise ho gaye
 It is clear that the inside of the party is at its peak

 Such national eminent and well-known national leaders can be sent to the Rajya Sabha
 aisa nirdesh sangh parivaar ne bijepi haikaman ko diya he
 To say that there are instructions inside, but it is considered as 'suggestion'
 is gopneey nirdesh ke baad se bijepi ke andar khalabali machi hui he

 After direct communication with the public in candidate selection, the Sangh Parivar has now suggested the second formula for leaders above 75 years not to contest from Lok Sabha
 is suzav ke peeche sangh kii soch ye he ki 75 se adhik umr ke netaa sanghathan ko liye boj ho sakate hai
 Also, the way the young voter has increased in the country, it is also a good message to attract them
 is suzav par bijepi sanghathan main andarkhaate kaaphi manthan ho rahaa he
 This suggestion of the Sangh is in favor of not implementing more than 75 years, but also the leaders above 65 years, because in the next election, the Sangh can take a tough decision and reduce the age limit to 70 years or less
 aise main vah is suzav ko vyavhaarik nahin maan rahe hai
 If this suggestion is implemented, then in the next election, they can certainly get their cards clear
 haalanki sangh parivaar ne yah bhi vikalp diya he ki 75 se adhik aayu vaale party ke jo varisht netaa hai, unako puri tarah se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The organization and the country will need their experiences
 unhen rajyasabha main le liya jayega
 Apart from this, he can give the name of his family's son, daughter, daughter-in-law and other nearest as an option for contesting elections

 - input bhashaa Noted scientist Jayant Narlikar has refused to return the Sahitya Akademi honor in protest against the assassination of Kannada litterateur MM Kalburgi, but said that law and order is the responsibility of the government and public anger should be on the part of those responsible for maintaining it
 narlikar ne raashtrapati pranab mukherjee ko likhe patr main kaha ki puraskaron kii vishesh garima hoti he or unhen is virodh se upar rakhana chahie
 He said that the Sahitya Akademi delayed response to Kalburgi's murder
 vahiin kai sammaan vijetaon kaa puraskaar lautaanaa santhaan main bhaavana kii kami par unke krodh kaa pratik he
 The comments bhartiya rashtriya vigyaan academy main faillo rahe narlikar ne patr main likhaa, ukt ghatana ke liye sahitya academy ko nishchit rup se kade shabdon main apana kshobh prakat karnaa chahie tha
 Its fellows and awardees should have pressured the academy to strongly condemn the atmosphere of suppressing independent thinking
 unhone kaha, haalanki is tarah se academy puraskaron ko lautaanaa uchit nahin lagata
 Awards have a special dignity that reflects their national character and should be kept above this protest
 narlikar ne kaha ki bigadati kanoon-vyavastha ke liye sahitya academy kii bajaay sarkaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya janaa chahie
 Narlikar said in a letter to President Pranab Mukherjee that awards have special dignity and they should be kept above this protest
 unhone kaha ki sahitya academy ne kalburgi kii hatya par deree se pratikriya di
 At the same time, returning many award winners is a sign of their anger at the lack of emotion in the institute
 tippaniyan Narlikar, who was a Fellow at the Indian National Science Academy, wrote in the letter, "the Sahitya Akademi must have expressed his anger in strong words for the said incident
" iske faillo or puraskaar vijetaon ko academy par swatantra soch ko dabaae jane ke maahaul kii kadi ninda ke liye dabaav bananaa chahie tha
 He said, however, it does not seem appropriate to return the Academy Awards in this way
 puraskaron kii ek vishesh garima hoti he jinamein unka rashtriya charitra jhalkata he or inhen is virodh se upar rakhana chahie
 Narlikar said that the government should be held responsible for deteriorating law and order rather than Sahitya Akademi

 utyub channel AIB ke 18 maheenon main 10 lakh sabsakribar ho gaye hai
 Some of its abusive content, aired on youtube and digital media, has been in the news for quite some time
 aise kaarykram kitne sahi hai, kitne galat hai
 But the basic question is why this program was made
 shuruyaat halki kamedi se
 
 
 On 2 February 2013, comedy group AIB uploaded the first video to its youtube channel
 baatcheet filmon ke seen par ho rahi thi
 Occasional abuses were also being given
 kareeb aath lakh log use ab tak dekh chuke hai
 Not much appreciated ho saktaa he kai ne is group ke vivaadon main aa jane ke baad ise dekha ho
 Tremendous Creativity on Serious Issues
 
 
 19 sitambar 2013, kalki kochaling ko feechar karte hue ek video aplod kiya gaya, jisamen kalki ne vyangy karte hue behad hi prabhaavshaalee dhang se ye bataaya ki mahilaon ke kapade, unke mobile phone istemaal ko rape ke liye uksaane vaala bataaya janaa kitna bakawaas he
 Over 46 lakh people have watched that video so far
 5 march 2014, isi group ne donneton ke said effects sheershak se ek video jari kiya
 More than 1
2 million people have seen the genius of this group through this video, which has filmed the anger of a child in a very interesting way, who is scolding his father for his honesty and getting him admitted to a big college
 Will be able to kahaan se laaegaa vah donneton ke paise
 
 
 
 or 15 agast 2014 ke aplod kiye gaye video ne to kamaal hi kar diya
 Over 21 lakh people watched this video of telephonic conversation between the youth of India and Pakistan
 29 hajaar se zyada ne ise saraahaa
 People watched all these videos very well
 jamkar saraahaa
 And shared
 haa, ye achaanak viral nahin hue
 And there was no discussion in the country by keeping them at the center
 kyonki, in vishyon par prayog hote rahe hai
 So why foolishness to do something different? The idea of AIB Roast was introduced
 gaali-galoch bhale is kaarykram kaa video web kii duniya main aate hi koharaam much gaya
 All kinds of audiences, all kinds of reactions
 yuva, bujurg, celibrity or sarkaar
 It reached the top trending in the world on youtube and Twitter
 lekin jin video ke bare main upar zikr kiya gaya he, unhen darshak kabhi bhi dekhen to unase khud ko rilate kar paaenge
 Instead of an abusive show organized in the name of laughing
 chaar yuvaaon ne milakar AIB banaaya he
 Gursimran Khamba, Tanmay Bhatt, Roshan Joshi and Ashish Saikia are the brains behind it
 shuruyaat main ye apane kaarykram ko podcast (digital telecast) karte the
 Then came to youtube if the fund was needed
 khud ko kaarobaari rup se safal sabit karne ke liye unhone ek aisa rasta chunaa, jo vivaadit ho gaya
 Yes, earnings were also made
 darasal, mudda sirf gaali-galoch vaale kaarykram kaa nahin he
 The question is also about the genius of these genius youth
 jo pehle rape, bharat-pakistan or donneton jaise vishay par kamaal ke creativity karte hai
 But later they have to come on the way to AIB Roast
 kyon?pratibha main koi kami aa gai ho, aisa to ho nahin saktaa
 Yes, it takes a little hard work
 lekin ye mehnat karne se bachanaa chaahate the aisa bhi nahin he
 So did it all just to gain popularity and earn money fast? Whatever the reason, the argument is rejected that such programs should be approved
 'baby ko base pasand he' kii superhit dhun par superstar salmaan khan thirake, to unki film 'sultan' box offis kii sultan sabit hui
 On the same lines, the political strategist PK has coined the political slogan to make Tipu i
e
 Akhilesh Yadav once again the 'sultan of UP' i
e
 CM in the political battle of UP
 lekin, pike ranneetikaar to hai rahul gandhi ke, or rahul gandhi kii congress kaa gathjod he akhilesh kii samaajawaadee party se
 That is why PK has taken special care of this while creating the political tune of UP
 sutron ke mutabik, pike ne baby ko base pasand he or salmaan kii khaskar yuvaaon main lokapriyata ke maddenjar nayaa naaraa banaaya he- "upi ko ye saath pasand he"
 Actually, the alliance of Congress and SP has been done
 poster, binar or naaron main congress-sapa ke saath-saath priyanka-dimple or akhilesh-rahul khub dikhne lage hai
 The activists of both the parties are also getting this much pleasure
 aise main isi kaa phayda upi main lene ke liye or yuvaaon ko lubhaane ke liye ye nayaa naaraa gadha gaya he
 Earlier, Team PK threw the slogan of 'your boy vs outsider Modi'
 koshish rahi ki, bihar chunaav main bahari banaam bihari kii tarj upi main bhi bijepi kaa siem cheharaa naa hone kaa phayda uthaaya jaae or piem modi to siem banenge nahin, isliye nitish kii tarj par akhilesh kii shakhsiyat ko chamkaaya jaae
 According to media reports, Akhilesh himself objected to this slogan
 lekin team pike ke sutron ke mutabik, ye sab bebuniyaad baaten hai
 "apne boy (rahul-akhilesh) versus outsider Modi" was never a slogan, rather it is a theme
 isamen koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya or naa hi kabhi akhilesh yaa congress se kisi ne koi aitraaj jataayaa
 If sources are to be believed, there is a plan to launch a new slogan with this theme in Lucknow on 29 January
 sutara ye bhi daawa kar rahe hai ki, 29 janvari ko hi akhilesh or rahul kii sanyukt press vaarta kaa kaarykram bhi taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Overall, Team PK, which is working under the strategy of making Congress's Shahzade, i
e
 Rahul, the country's Kasultaniyan PM in 2019
 usase pehle usko upi main "tipu ko sultan" yani upi ke siem kii kursi par baithaana hoga
 Right now it is not a political film, but there is no opportunity for retake
 haalanki, ab tak pike bhi siyasat ke wo diarector rahe hai, jo sirf hit dete rahe hai phir chaahe vomodifor piem ho yaa phir modi ko chunauti dekar bihar main nitish for siem
 So get ready for March 11 when the picture will be revealed, Tipu became Sultan or Tipu was a flop
 ban gaye to pike ek baar phir champion varna pike back tu pavilion
 The crew of Air India is in awe these days due to fear of ghosts
 air india ke kru ne chicago ke ek hotel main bhoot hone kaa daawa kiya he
 The crew has been appealed to the management to change their hotel, after which the company has said that they are investigating the matter
 media reports kii maane, to dipti chif cabin ne chicago ke ek hotel main nakaaratmak urja hone ke bare main chitthee likhi he, vahiin unhone kaha he ki is dar se kai logon ko cameraa share karnaa pad rahaa he
 He wrote in his complaint that "even online information about hotel activities is available in the hotel, but in spite of this a contract has been made with the hotel

 i request you to investigate this matter and change the hotel immediately

" 'dilli main bhi bhoot!aapako bataa den ki haal hi main rajdhani dilli ke ek gaanv main in dinon ek ajeeb dehshat kaa maahaul he
 The incident of three women mysteriously cutting the top of a single day in Kanganhedi village in Chawla has created awe in the entire village
 khauf is kadar ki gaanv kii ladakiyon ne skool tak janaa band kar diya he
 After Mewat, Gurgaon and Jhajjar districts of Haryana, people are now sleepy due to this type of incident in Delhi too
 kangnhedi gaanv ke kuch log ise chotii kaatane vaala 'shaitan' bataa rahe hai, to kuch ise andekhi shaktiyon se jodakar dekh rahe hai
 In fact, the villagers have been greatly frightened by three incidents in the village
 jammu-kashmir main pidipi-bijepi gathbandhan ko satta sanbhale abhi paanch din bhi nahin hue hai
 But the government of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has earned a lot of name on the strength of the rhetoric, whereas now the feeling of dissatisfaction within the government is also spreading
 khabaron ke mutabik, mantralayon ke vibhaajan ko lekar donon dalon main matbhed kii sthiti ban rahi he
 While leaving the section of separatism and returning to the mainstream, the chairman of the People's Conference, Sajjad Gani Lone, is said to be angry about his department
 jaankaree ke mutabik, sajaad lone kii naaraazgi ne sarkaar ke liye nayaa sankat paidaa kar diya he
 Sajjad has refused to take charge
 unke saath hi pidipi vidhayak imran ansaari ne bhi apana padbhaar grahan karne se manaa kar diya he
 Sajjad Lone, expressing his displeasure on Wednesday, thought it better to catch a plane from Srinagar to Srinagar than go to office in the morning
 bijepi cote se mantri bane lone ko vigyaan praudyogiki or pashupaalan vibhaag kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he, jabaki imran ansaari ko soochna praudyogiki, takneekee shiksha or yuva seva maamle vibhaag die gaye hai
 Informants given to BJP leaders said that all the leaders and workers of the People's Conference are unhappy with the department received by their chairman
 khud sajaad lone ko ummid thi ki unhen gramin vikaas vibhaag, rajasav yaa bijli vibhaag mil saktaa he
 His party has called it insulting to its leader
 karibiyon ne bataaya ki sajaad ne bijepi netaaon se babat baat kii he or spasht kar diya he ki vah aise vyavhaar ko sahan nahin karenge
 On the other hand, Imran Ansari of PDP has also expressed his displeasure to party mentor and Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed
 unhone apni naaraazgi jataate hue kaha ki kashmir main pidipi ke khate main paanch siten sirf unke khandaan kii badaulat hi ai hai
 BJP decided the department
 Meanwhile, Education Minister Naeem Akhtar and pdp's chief spokesperson avoided questions related to the controversy, saying that the division of the portfolios was entirely the prerogative of the Chief Minister
 sajaad lone bijepi cote se mantri hai or unhen koun sa vibhaag diya jaae, yah bijepi ne hi tay kiya he
 Significantly, Sajjad Gani Lone has been made a cabinet minister from the BJP quota in the coalition government, while Imran Ansari is the son of late PDP leader Maulana Iftikhar Hussain Ansari
 vah pattan se chunaav jite hai, vahiin unke chachaa ne pidipi ke liye srinagar main neshnal conference se uskaa majboot kila jadibal kshetra jeeta he

 Pollution levels in Delhi have increased rapidly once again
 dilli kii kharaab quality immergency kii catagori main pahunch chuki he
 Pollution in Delhi as well as many states has made people's lives difficult
 dilli ke kai ilaakon main air quality index khatarnaak str par pahunch gaya he
 The air quality index in these areas has crossed 700
 aapako bataa den ki air quality index main 401 se 500 ke bich ko 'gambhir' jabaki 1000 hone par 'immergency' kii sthiti maani jaati he
 Taking care of health in the pollution of emergency category is also a challenging task
 aaie jaanate hai is jaanaleva hawa se khud ko kaise bachaaen
 1
 akyuai index 400 ke paar ho to ghar ke andar rahen, saamaanya walk bhi naa karen
 Even if you have to get out of the house, do not leave without a mask
 maujuuda halaat main biking mask sabase sahi rahenge
 2
 apane ghar or aas-paas kii jagahon par zyada se zyada ped lagaaein
 They purify the air
 jisase aap taaji hawa main saans le paaenge
 3
 saanson se sharir main pahunche jehar ko baahar nikaalane ke liye pani bahut jaruri he
 So do not forget to drink water
 din main takreeban 4 litre tak pani pien
 Drink water while leaving the house
 4
 Use vitamin-c, omega-3 as much as possible in food
 shahad, lahasun, adarak kaa khaane main zyada se zyada istemaal karen
 In the condition of cough, cold, consume honey and ginger juice
 5
 Do not allow children to play outside as long as there is pollution
 cycling karne se bachein, zyada der paidal naa chalem
 6
 kaph kii dikkat he to shahad main kaali mirch milakar len
 At the same time, garlic contains antibiotic elements which increase the ability to fight pollution
 7
 Always keep medicines together if you are an asthma patient
 garbhvatee mahilaayein ghar main rahane ke dauraan bhi mask pahanen
 8
 subah ke vakt pradooshan kaa str zyada hota he isliye morning walk par nahin jaaen
 Get out only after sunshine
 motorcical yaa cycle se baahar nahin nikalen
 9
 ghar ke liye naa sahi, lekin car ke liye air purifire jarur liya ja saktaa he
 If you are going out of the house in times of high traffic then this can prove to be a very good way of rescue
 10
 Use vacuum cleaner instead of broom
 dhul ke kan pradooshan failaane kaa kaam karte hai
 In such a situation, if you use vacuum cleaner instead of sweep in polluted areas, then there will be no problem in breathing

 (input bhashaa se) The Parliament of Pakistan finally passed the Hindu Marriage Bill, pending for several decades
 is bill ke paarit hone se ab pakistan main alpsankhyak samudaay hinduon se jude ahm masalon ko kanoonee jama pahanaaya ja sakegaa
 The bill seeks to provide protection to Hindus for marriage, family, mother and child
 nae bill ke kanoon banane ke baadpakistan main hinduon kii shaadiyon kaa registrationho sakegaa
 The marriage of Hindus was not registered here for the last 66 years, due to which this community felt very insecure
 inke alaava talaak or jabaran dharmaparivartan jaise masalon kaa aasaani se samaadhaan nikaala ja sakegaa
 Till now people of the Hindu community, especially women, had no documents to prove their marriage
 inke alaava yah samudaay punarvivaah, santan god lene or uttaradhikaar jaise kanoonee adhikaron se vanchit tha
 The new law is also expected to curb incidents of kidnapping of Hindu women in Abpakistan
 pakistan main hinduon kii aabaadi vahaan kii jansankhya kaa mahaj 2 fisadi he
 According to the 1998 census, the population of Hindus in Pakistan was around 2
5 million
 bharat kii sansad ne hindu vivaah adhinium 1955 main paarit kiya tha
 There is a lot of difference between Indian law and Pakistani law regarding Hindu marriage
 pakistan main hindu vivaad adhinium vahaan ke hindu samudaay ke logon par lagu hota he
 Whereas in India Hindu Marriage Act applies to Jain, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsi and Christian community apart from Hindus
 pakistan main hindu marriage bilke draft ke mutabik shaadi ke 15 dinon ke bheetar iskaa registration karana hoga
 While there is no specific provision for this in Indian law
 bhartiya hindu vivaah adhinium kii dhara 8 main kaha gaya he ki shaadiyon ke registration ke bare main rajya sarkarein kanoon bana sakati hai
 According to the bill in Pakistan, a Hindu couple must be 18 years or older at the time of marriage
 jabaki bharat main hindu vivaah adhinium ke tahat ladke kii umr 21 saal or ladki kii umr 18 saal yaa usase adhik honi chahie
 The Hindu marriage bill passed in Pakistan also states that if the husband and wife have been living apart for a year or more and do not want to live with each other, they can do so if they want to cancel the marriage
 
 jabaki bhartiya kanoon ke mutabik agar pati-patni do varshon yaa usase adhik samay se alag rah rahe hai or shaadi ko radd karnaa chahen to wo aisa kar sakate hai
 According to this bill in Pakistan, a Hindu widow will also have the right to marry again after six months of the death of her husband
 bharat main hindu vidhwaaon kii shaadi se jude praavdhaan Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856 main nihit hai
 There is no fixed time limit for re-marriage under this law
 is vidheyak main is baat kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he ki agar koi hindu vyakti apni pehali patni ke hote hue duusari shaadi karata he to yah ek dandaneey aparaadh mana jayega
 In India, marrying a second wife while being a first wife is an offense punishable under both the Hindu Marriage Act and the Indian Penal Code
 iske alaava yah hindu vivaah adhinium ke tahat talaak ke liye ek ground bhi he
 In Pakistan, the Bill provides for imprisonment for six months for violation of Hindu marriage registration rules
 jabaki bharat main hindu vivaah adhinium ke tahat sajaa kaa aisa koi praavdhaan nahin he

 However, the Shiv Sena also said that ever since the Modi government was formed at the Center, people have been coming forward in support of Hindutva
 par sachai yah he ki jab centre main congress sarkaar chhadam dharmanirpekshata ke naam par muslim tushtikaran kar rahi thi tab bhi shivasena aawaaj uthaati thi
 From VD Savarkar to Bal Thackeray kept saying repeatedly that India is a 100% Hindu nation
 mohan bhagwat kaa samarthanauddhav thakare ne kaha, 'mohan bhagwat ne hindutv ko pukaara he
 They have expressed the view that we are a Hindu nation
 is bayaan ke chalate sanghasarchaalak ko hitler tak kehane kii hode lag gai he, isamen bhi koi ascharyajanak baat nahin he
 In a country whose urn stands on the shabby foundation of pseudo-secularism and where Muslim appeasement has become a political livelihood industry, what else can there be? ”we have already said that India is a Hindu nation
 'ever since Modi became the Prime Minister of the country, Hindutva ideas have been broken, it is true to say that when the Congress was in the country and when there was a Muslim vote bank Indu society was throat being pressed, even before VD Savarkar and then Shiv Sena chief said repeatedly rhythm hitting that yes, we have hundred percent Hindu nation and who shone at care this country can not wipe the Hindutva vaccine
 shivasena pramukh ne to hindutv kaa aisa prakhar angaar prakat kiya ki uske badanwaal main congress va unke bagalabacchon kaa dharmanirpekshata kaa dhong khaak ho gaya
 'modi became PM due to Hindutva ideas
 He said,' If Modi became Prime Minister, he would be because of his strong Hindutva ideas
 is desh ke samast hindu samaaj ne jati, panth bisarkar sirf hindu hone ke chalate shivasena-bijepi ke paksh main jamkar matdaan kiya
 Surprised by the Muslim sycophancy of the Congress, Hindu society then surrendered to pseudo-secularism

 Four types of prices of cylinders in the distributor market, are also opposing the non-default seal

 However, essential services, such as hospitals, etc
 have been excluded from this strike
 federation of alpiji distributor of india or ol india alpiji distributors federation ke pratinidhiyon ne ek press conference main bataaya ki ek hi silendar ke chaar daam hai
 Domestic used cylinders are priced between Rs 410-450, while gurudwaras and other institutions are given cylinders at a slightly higher price but slightly below the market price
 iske saath hi bazaar bhav vaale silendar bhi apane vajan ke anuroop alag daam par milte hai
 They demand that the price of cylinders should be minimized
 iske alaava silendar se gas chori rokane ke liye petroleum mantralay ko licage pruf sil lagaani chahie, jisase chori puri tarah band ho
 He raised the question that if the Ministry is unsuccessful in bringing such a seal, then why should the distributors take the brunt of it because they cannot go after every delivery man
 distributaron kii maang he ki bazaar main gaiyr kanoonee tareeke se beche ja rahe 2 se lekar 5 kilo ke silendaron par turant roak lagaai jaae
 Along with this, new cylinders should be launched in 2 to 5 kg and their market price should be kept lower than those sold illegally
 iske saath hi distribution se judi shikayaton main samjhaute ke maukey die jaaen
 They say that sometimes there is an unwanted mistake
 kai baar samvaad kii kami se bhi samasya aati he, lekin, sidhe jurmaana laga diya jaataa he
 In order to reduce such problem, in reasonable cases, the opportunity to interact with the complainant should be given

" ' Paswan said that the central government has taken several steps like raising the minimum export price of onion and potato to control prices, but the long-term solution lies in the development of a nationalized market

 The rule is that when any member of both the houses of Parliament resigns from his membership, it is only to write in a line and hand it over to the concerned chairman or speaker
 jabaki mayawati ne jo istipha rajyasabha chairman ke offis jaakar saunpa wo teen pannon kaa he

 captain amarinder ne apane tyaagptr main istipha dene ke kaaran kii vyakhya bhi kii thi, jiske upyukt na maanate hue manjuur nahin kiya gaya tha
 This means that the format in which Mayawati has submitted her resignation will not be accepted

 Shiv Sena's senior leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said that former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' haste in regaining power and "childish comments" led to BJP in Maharashtra and Fadnavis sitting in opposition Gone
 raut ne shivasena ke mukhpatr ''saamana'' main apane ''rokhthok'' stambh main daawa kiya ki shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare (uddhav Thackeray), ncpsuprimo sharad pavaar (sharad Pawar) or congress netaa sonia gandhi (sonia Gandhi) ke saath aane se maharashtra main jo hua vah desh ko bhi sweekaar he
 Attacking the central leadership of BJP without naming anyone, he said that Maharashtra did not succumb to the "mob system" like Delhi
 ''saamana'' ke kaaryakari sampadak raut ne kaha ki mahatvapurn yah he ki uddhav thakare shaktishaalee ''modi-shah ke dabadabe'' ko khatm kar satta main aae
 He exuded confidence that "this government (shiv sena-ncp-congress alliance) will last for five years"
 raut ne kaha, ''mujhe yah dekhakar majaa aa rahaa he ki jo log ajit pavaar ke fadanvis ke saath gathjod ko sharad pavaar kii pehle se tay yojana bataa rahe the, vah ab maha vikaas aghadi sarkaar (maha vikas aghadi Government)banane ke baad NCP pramukh ke aage natmastak ho rahe hai''
 The Rajya Sabha member said that in the wake of assembly elections, Fadnavis made such "childish comments" that no opposition party would survive in the state, Sharad Pawar's time was coming to an end and Prakash Ambedkar's deprived Bahujan aghadi would be the main opposition party
 '
 unhone kaha, ''lekin vah (fadanvis) khud vipakshi netaa ban gaye''
 He said that Fadnavis had said that he would return but his haste to come to power submerged the BJP within 80 hours

 Raut said the Maharashtra Governor's office played the role of a "villain" in Fadnavis and NCP leader Ajit Pawar's 80-hour government
 unhone kaha, ''rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne ek baar mujhase kaha tha ki vah samvidhan kii ruparekha ke itar jaakar kuch bhi nahin karenge
 But later he administered oath to Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar in a hurry
 aisa lagata he ki 'alaakaman' se mili aadesh ne badi bhoomika nibhaai''
 He mentioned the center indirectly to the high command
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ko samarthan dene kii ajit pavaar kii 'bechaini' shivasena, NCP or congress ko najadik lekar gai or unhone gathbandhan banaaya
 He said that this also put pressure on the other NCP mlas who had revolted and with everyone returning to Sharad Pawar, his nephew Ajit Pawar also returned
 raut ne kaha, ''agar sharad pavaar aage nahin aate to yah gathbandhan kabhi nahin ho paata''
 He said that everyone in Congress was skeptical about joining hands with Shiv Sena
 sharad pavaar ne hi sonia gandhi se kaha ki shivasena sansthaapak divangat bal thakare ke purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke saath mitravat sambandh the
 Raut said that the Shiv Sena had not fielded its candidate against the Congress in the state assembly elections held after the Emergency in the country
 shivasena ne raashtrapati pad ke chunaav main pratibha patil or pranab mukherjee kii ummidavaari kaa bhi samarthan kiya tha

 The announcement of all major bills and policies should start with the Green Paper, in which its key points should be kept so that it can be debated in public
 2
 After this, the second phase will be in the white paper in which the government will make a clear proposal and clarify the direction of its proposals
 3
 Whether or not a green or white paper came on the draft of any bill, it should be put before the public for two months before it is introduced in Parliament
 is samay sthiti yah he ki kanoon banane se pehle janata apni raay tabhi vyakt kar sakati he, jab vidheyak ko sansad kii sthaayee samiti ke paas bheja jaae, jo us par sansad kaa faisla hone par hi vichaar karti he
 But many major laws like the SEZ Act were never referred to the standing committee
 abhi yah spasht nahin he ki kya enesi bhavishya main niti niyantaaon or janamat ke bich antar falak ke rup main badi bhoomika nibhaayegi
