 bijepi main sheersh str par chale lambey manthan ke baad antat: uma bharti ko jhaansi-lalitpur seat se party pratyaashee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 If sources are to be believed, party strategists believe that Uma Bharti will not only be able to bring back the lost credentials of BJP on jhansi-lalitpur seat, but also the Lodhi dominated seat of Uttar Pradesh including Tikamgarh and Chhatarpur in Bundelkhand's Madhya Pradesh region
 Will influence you from here

 Even after playing all the bets, the BJP did not win from here, in such a situation the party has expected Uma Bharti
 madhyapradesh kii purv mukhyamantri uma bharti kaa yah pehla loksabhaa chunaav nahin he
 Before the separation of Chhatarpur and Tikamgarh Lok Sabha seats, both the districts used to be Khajuraho parliamentary seat
 is seat se uma bharti lagaataar teen baar saansad raheen
 He contested the first election from Khajuraho on a BJP ticket in 1984 against Vidyavati Chaturvedi of Congress, in which he was defeated
 iske baad hue 1989 ke chunaav main uma ne congress kii vidyavati chaturvedi ko 1
 Defeated by a long margin of 93 lakh votes
 1991 ke chunaav main uma bharti ne congress ke ramratan chaturvedi va 1996 main congress ke hi shriram kushvaha ko parajeet kiya
 Jhansi seems to be the most suitable place for the party to cash in on the casteist figures and the Hinduist image of Sadhvi

 aapane college main hone vaali raging ke bare main khub suna hoga, lekin kya aapane kabhi suna he ki uniwarsity ke kisi group main shaamil hone ke liye kitni yaatnaaon or third degree se hokar guzarana padataa he
 Yes, a former member of the notorious Fraternity of a University of America has revealed how he was beaten up for being a member of Fraternity and was kept barefoot in a snow-filled bucket
 lekin yatnaa or dard kii intehaan yaheen par khatm nahin hoti
 At that time Justin Stuart was 19 years old and was studying at Salisbury University in Maryland, USA
 tab stuart 'sigma alpha ipsilon' naam kii froternity kii branch ke nae-nae sadsy bane the
 Stuart, along with other members, had to undergo rigorous torture to carry out the dangerous rituals of the group to join the fraternity
 aapako bataa den ki 'sigma alpha ipsilon froternity' kaa gathan america kii alabama uniwarsity main 9 march 1956 ko hua tha
 This fraternity is infamous for deaths from alcohol, drugs, torture and stern tasks
 stuart bataate hai ki unhen barf se bhari baaltee main nange badan khadey rahakar froternity ke siddhanton ko padhane ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa tha
 During this time, he had to wear only underwear and the rest of the members of the fraternity used to pour water buckets on him
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki saal 2012 main unhen aath hafton tak dandon se peeta gaya
 Not only this, they were asked to drink water till they fainted
 yahi nahin unhen napis or mahilaon ke kapade pahanane padate the
 He told that once the new members of the Fraternity were locked in the basement for nine hours and during this time they were neither given food nor water
 unhen toilet jane kii bhi ijaajat nahin thi
 Stuart states that members of the Fraternity were treated like detainees of Guattanamo Bay
 aapako bataa den ki 2012 kii is report ko ab jaakar saarvajanik kiya gaya he
 According to foreign newspaper 'the Independent', Stuart is now studying in another university and he says that Yeta still haunts him today
 ve kehete hai, 'mujhe kabhi-kabhi basament main hue atyaacharon ke sapane aate hai
 i hear shouting and shouting
 aisa lagata he ki maano wo abhi mujh par hamalaa kar denge
 Then my eye opens and i come out of my nightmare '
 stuart ne uniwarsity ke adhikariyon se unke saath hue atyaachaar kii shikaayat kii thi, jiske baad sigma alpha ipsilon froternity ko is saal farvari tak bain kar diya gaya
 Some members of the Fraternity were so angry with this ban that they stopped giving donations to the university
 aapako bataa den ki america ke lagbhag har ek rajya main is froternity kii shakhaaen hai
 And so far disciplinary action has been taken against it more than 100 times
 2009 se lekar ab tak isaki 15 shakhaaen nirast ho gayi hai
 Vindeshwari Prasad Yadav alias Bindi Yadav, husband of JDU MLC Manorama Devi, was sent to jail for 14 days in connection with the shooting and killing of Aditya Sachdeva, the son of a businessman in Gaya, Bihar
 police ne bindi yadav or unke bodyguard rajesh kumaar ko giraftaar kiya tha, jabaki unka betaa aaropee rocky yadav abhi bhi faraar he
 At the same time, Gaya bandh has been announced by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to protest against this sensational murder

 This bandh is also supported by the Gaya 'chamber of Commerce'
 shahar ke adhikansh dukandaar apni dukaanon ko band kar sadak par utar aae hai
 The bandh includes all the constituents of the NDA including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Hindustani Awam Morcha
 kendriya mantri ramkripal yadav ne kaha ki nitish sarkaar janata ko dhokhaa de rahi he
 It has nothing to do with the public interest
 bataate chalem ki shanivaar der raat bodhgaya se laut rahe jadyu emelsi manorama devi ke bete rocky yadav keeland rover krujko aditya sachdeva dwaara overtek karne ke baad donon main kahasuni ho gai thi
 The feud between the two escalated so much that Rocky shot Aditya
 buree tarah ghayal aditya kii ghatnasthal par hi maut ho gai thi
 In this case, accused Yadav is still out of police custody

 Police teams are also raiding in other states
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bindi yadav ne hi rocky ko faraar kara diya he
 His background is criminal

 Exit poll estimates once again indicate a strong comeback of the Modi government
 ajtak-exis maai india kaa agsit pole bhartiya janata party ko abaki baar 300 paar pahunchaa rahaa he
 However, in the midst of political discussion on the exit poll, some such figures of seats have also come out, which can increase or decrease the graph of both BJP and Congress
 ajtak-exis maai india ke agsit pole main desh kii aisi 78 loksabhaa siten nikalakar ai hai, jin par kaante kii takkar he
 Here a difference of only 3 percent of the vote between the winning and losing candidates is coming out
 aise main ye antar jis taraf shift hota he, mumkin he uski siton par bhi iskaa asar jarur dikhaai degaa

 shila dikshit ne kaha ki sarkaar ne dilli or madhyapradesh main upie sarkaar dwaara niyukt rajyapalon ko kyon nahin hataaya he
 The government targeted only a few governors

 dilli ke uparajyapal najeeb jang ne 3 july 2013 ko padbhaar sambhala tha jabaki madhyapradesh ke rajyapal ram naresh yadav ne 8 sitambar 2011 rajyapal pad sambhala tha
 Sheila Dixit said that the post of Governor is constitutional
 is pad kii garima kaa sammaan karnaa jaruri he lekin sarkaar ne kuch rajyapalon ke saath bahut hi bura vyavhaar kiya
 Sheila said that perhaps the time has come when a law should be made regarding the resignation of governors as soon as the government changes

 Now let's come to why we are doing prime time on this
 bina kisi vyapak sanghathan ke gujarat bhar main daliton kaa gussa sadakon par kaise chhalkaa, kya gujarat main dalit aakraamakata kaa koi nayaa daur he
 For this, Dalits from Ahmedabad are going to understand politics
 ab doosraa sawaal yah he ki kya gau raksha ke naam par ho rahe bavaalon par khulkar baat kar sakate hai
 Is this image correct that society thinks on this issue in the same way or will have to think
 is baat par charchaa ke liye hamaare saath pune se vijay dewan sahab hai
 This ashram is located in village Gagoda, 100 km from Mumbai
 vinoba bhaave kaa gaanv
 This ashram is Vinoba Ashram only
 vijay dewan kii koi jati nahin he, dharm nahin he
 The parents were Brahmins
 1982 main 25 saal kii umr main vijay dewan khaal utaarne kaa kaam karne yahaan aa gaye
 Since then, they shed the skin of dead animals
 is kaam main kisi kaa saath nahin miltaa, koi sawari nahin milti, lihaaza khaal utaarne ke baad apni peeth par lad kar laate hai
 For centuries, the work for which the Dalits endured, bruised and poisoned, carried the bite on their back, for which the Una's Dalits were smeared with aluminum sticks
 meri nazar main vijay dewan se behatar koi doosraa nahin hoga is masale par baat karne ke liye
 His experiences may inspire you to think on this issue in a new way

 Four Dalit youths have been tied to the back of modernism
 inhen jis nafrat se maaraa ja rahaa he wo na jane kab se hamaare samaaj main he
 Even though it was not a modern car, it was hated and even after the arrival of this car, the same hatred is true
 ye jawan gujarat ke hai magar ye kahin ke bhi ho sakate hai
 Rather, in all the incidents, such youth have been found who have been involved in violence against Dalits
 inke haath main aluminium kii lathi bataati he ki inkaa koi na koi sangathit rup rahaa hoga
 One should know from where they get the money that they walk on eight and a half million Xilos, tying and killing Dalit youths
 marpet main shaamil 8 logon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya he, 6 police waalon ko suspend kar diya he, maamle kii sunwaayee ke liye vishesh adaalat kaa gathan karne kii baat ho rahi he, lekin yah bhi jaananaa zaruri he ki aise log ke paas itane sansaadhan kahaan se aate hai
 With whom are they related that a gang of ten to fifteen people is gathered with them to kill someone with the law
 una se 50 kimi dur 22 may ko bhi aisi hi ghatana hui lekin us maamle main kuch khaas nahin hua
 Dalits were beaten and video was made
 ghatana apane aap main jitani sharmnaak he utana hi saahasik he, is ghatana kaa virodh
 As soon as the matter of the cow came, the speech of good political parties started shivering, but what happened by the Dalits of Gujarat makes this event even bigger and historical
 dalit samaaj ne trakon par mrit gaayon ko ladaa or surendranagar ke colector ke daftar main jaakar chhod aae ki ham antim sanskaar nahin karenge
 The cow whose mother seems to do it
 ye or baat he doctor ambedkar ne ye kaam chhod dene kii baat dashakon pehle kii thi
 Yet in recent decades, there was no such retaliation of the courage of cow guards anywhere in India
 shaayad isiilie gau rakshakon kaa hausala itnaa bad gaya ki in yuvakon ko maarane peetane ke baad sabane inhen neeche bithakar tasviir bhi khinchaai

 In Jharkhand too, two Muslim youths were allegedly murdered on the basis of suspicion that a cow was smuggling
 virodh ho rahaa tha magar hamaare netaa bhi gaay ke naam par samaaj se samvaad karne se dar rahe the
 They felt that there is no other argument about the cow
 log gussa ho jaaenge
 While doing this he was imagining just one type of people
 unki kalpana main dur dur tak gujarat ke daliton kaa yah jawaab tha hi nahin yahaan ki dalit saansadon or netaaon ke paas bhi jawaab nahin tha
 They too were silent
 5 march 2016 kii raat haryana ke shahabaad ke nazadik gau rakshak dal ke sadasyon ne kathith rup se jaanwaron ke ek taskar ko pakad liya
 His body was later recovered

 Such things have come to the notice of the court that these parties break the law and also make recovery with the poor people going for grazing with their animals
 inase police bhi mili hoti he
 Now some things about cow and cow schools
 hamaare desh main kuch bahut hi acchhee gau shalaayen hai
 You can leave them or despite them, cows in all cities are doomed to eat plastic bags in the garbage heap
 is haalat main koi sudhaar nahin hua he
 If the list of people who have occupied the land of cow variables in panchayats will be made, then all political parties will take leave from this debate
 zyaada doodh ke liye gaay ko jo injection maaraa jaataa he wo kitna kshtprad he
 Yet incidents of cow defenders have not occurred in large numbers
 magar inase jo dehshat kaa vaataavaran failaa he uskaa asar sankhya se zyaada he
 Insecurity spread in a particular section
 logon ko laga ki kab koun se maance ko kya samaj liya jayega
 As long as there was an angle of Hindu versus Muslim, most of the silence was there, but Dalits have changed this silence
 gujarat main pichley teen dinon main kai jagahon par pradarshan hue hai
 Incidents ranging from Chakka Jam, stone pelting and vandalism have taken place at many places including Amreli, Junagadh, Rajkot, Ghoraji, Porbandar, Bhavnagar, Ahmedabad

 9 din lag gaye vipaksh ke saansadon ko samajhane main gujarat ke daliton ke bich itnaa gussa he
 There was a lot of controversy between the government and the opposition
 ab aate hai ki ham is par prime time kyon kar rahe hai
 Without any comprehensive organization, how did the anger of Dalits spread across the streets in Gujarat, is there any new phase of Dalit aggression in Gujarat
 iske liye hamaare saath ahmedabad se dalit raajnneeti ko samajhane vaale hai
 Now the second question is whether the cow can speak openly on the bawalas happening in the name of defense
 kya ye chhavi sahi he ki samaaj is masale par ek hi tarah se sochataa he yaa sochna hi padegaa
 We have Vijay Dewan Sahab from Pune to discuss this matter
 mumbai se sau kimi dur gagoda gaanv main ye ashram he

 sadiyon se daliton ne jis kaam ke liye dansh saha, zehar piyaa, us dansh ko apni peeth par lad kar laate hai, jis kaam ke liye una ke daliton kii peeth par alumunium kii lathi barasaai gai
 In my view, there will be no better person than Vijay Dewan to discuss this issue
 unke anubhav aapako is masale par nae tareeke se sochane ke liye prerit kar sakate hai
 The incident itself is as embarrassing as it is bold, the opposition to this event
 gaay kaa maamla aate hi achche-achche raajnneetik dalon kii jubaan kaanpane lagati thi, magar gujarat ke daliton ne jo kiya usase yah ghatana or bhi badi or aitihaasik ho jaati he
 The Dalit society loaded the dead cows on trucks and left the Collector office of Surendranagar leaving that we will not perform the last rites
 gaay jinaki mata lagati he wo karenge
 This is another matter, Dr

 dilli main jam lag rahaa he to dilli main achaanak zyada aane vaali haryana or upi kii gadiyon kii ginati koun kar rahaa he

 The Government of Delhi is bringing an app based premium bus, which will have wi-fi, CCTV and will be able to book from the app

 Now the government cannot say that what is printed in 'the Hindu' is not correct information
 uski file kaa hissaa nahin he
 The Supreme Court should order an inquiry on this matter
 raksha mantralay se sikret file kaise chori ho gai
 Original copy was stolen or photocopy
 jahaan sikret file rakhi jaati he us kamare main khidki or darvaaze hai yaa nahin
 What is the process of carrying a secret file? vahaan sisitivi camera he yaa nahin
 Secondly, when the news published in The Hindu newspaper is correct, the allegation proves that the government did not give all the information to the Supreme Court

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar targeted him during the recently concluded Parliament session, mimicking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'absence' and his style of speech

 Meanwhile, Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde lashed out at Pawar, saying that the NCP chief had to take to the streets, as there was no proper leader in his party

 uttar gujarat congress kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 In the Modi wave, the Congress has been waving the victory record in North Gujarat
 is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke liye bijepi se kahin zyada uske baagi sirdard bane hue hai
 The 19 rebels of the Congress have entered the electoral arena as a hindrance in the way of the Congress's return to power
 north gujarat main congress ke 16 baghiuttar gujarat main 16 baagi congress ke khilaaf maidan main hai or unhone party ke adhikarik ummidavaar ke khilaaf apana namakan waapas nahin liya he
 This makes the Congress's equation seem to be deteriorating
 congress kaa majboot gadhuttar gujarat main chah jile aate hai, inamen gandhinagar, banaaskantha, sabarkantha, aravali, mehsana or patan
 There are a total of 32 assembly seats in these districts
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress ne uttar gujarat main aadhi se zyada siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi he
 The Congress won 17 of the 32 seats and the BJP 15
 bataa den ki congress ne kuch siten to bahut kam maton se jeet darj kii thi
 In such a situation, the rise of the rebel candidate of the party has increased the trouble for Congress
 sabase zyada musiibat banaaskantha mencongress ke liye sabase zyada chunauti uttar gujarat ke banaaskantha jile main he
 The rebels are in the five assembly seats in front of the Congress here
 inamen tharad, vadgam, desa, deodaar or concourej nirvachan kshetra shaamil hai
 In Tharam, Congress has fielded BD Rajput in place of Mavjibhai Patel
 jabaki 2012 main maavji patel bijepi ke parbatbhai patel se 3473 voton se haare the
 The Mavjibhai Patel who is in the field as a rebel has refused to withdraw his name
 jignesh ke khilaaf do congressi bagiis tarah congress ke samarthan se utre jignesh mewaani ke liye vaadgam vidhansabha seat par he
 Two rebels of Congress are in the fray against Mevani
 aswin parmaar or baalkrishna jirawal hai
 Interestingly, Vadgam is considered the safest seat for the Congress
 pichley chunaav main congress ne is seat ko 21000 maton se jeet darj kii thi
 In Saurashtra in Gujarat's political battle, where there is voting in the first phase, then north Gujarat is considered the most important area of the second phase
 bharat kaa janamat apni is aitihaasik duvidha ke ek nae sanskaran se phir mukhaatib he ki use behad shaktishaalee centre sarkaar chahie yaa phir takat kaa santulan banaate rajya! bharat ko bhimkaay akhil bhartiya dal kii sarkaar chahie yaa phir kshetreey dalon kaa indradhanush, jo 1991 ke baad uga tha or 2014 main desh ke adhikansh bhugol par 'kamaloday' ke baad ast ho gaya
 This question started churning Indian politics from 1991 onwards, what would a party have to do to become an all India political party now? The only All India Party Congress was eroded
 udaarikaran or nijeekaran ke baad centre sarkaar kii aarthik shaktiyaan simit ho gayi or rajyon ke adhikaar badhate chale gaye
 With this, the All India wave was over in the elections! What was left then with an all-india party with whom he could address the entire country? Narendra Modi had limited options
 rashtriya suraksha yaa pakistan kaa khauf hi iklauta vishay tha jis par rajya sarkarein kya sawaal uthaati
 It is not in their right
 bhaajapa ne iskaa istemaal rajyon kii apekshaaon kii dhar kund karne main kiya or suraksha kii khatir taqatvar centre kii jarurat ko gale se utaarne kii koshish kii he
 To become an All India Party, any party has to form a powerful central government
 modi ko bhi 2014 ke baad aisa sab kuch karnaa padaa, mukhyamantri ke taur par jisase ve shaayad kabhi ittefaq nahin rakhte
 From the point of view of the states, the Modi rule remained the same as the Indira Congress of the North Nehru era
 rajyon ko baar-baar daraaya gaya
 Governments (uttarakhand, and Arunachal) were sacked and returned with the help of the Supreme Court
 kendriya jaanch agenciyon kaa is kadar rajnatik istemaal hua ki teen rajya sarkaron ne sibiai ke khilaaf baghawat kar di
 Not only this, in April last year, the southern states accused the Center of discrimination in resource sharing and questioned the Finance Commission
 darasal, shaktishaalee centre banaam santulit takat vaale rajyon kii uljhan samvidhan jitani puraani he
 Within three days of the announcement of the Mountbatten Plan for Partition in 1947, the Constituent Assembly sub-committee recommended a constitutional system with a center equipped with very powerful rights
 yah ambedkar the jinhone taqatvar centre ke prati samvidhan sabha ke aagrah ko santulit karte hue aise samvidhan par sahmati banaai jo sankat ke samay centre ko takat detaa tha lekin aam taur par sangheey (rajyon ko santulit adhikaar) siddhant par kaam karata tha
 Despite his insistence on a powerful center, Nehru consulted states in most cases after the constitution was enacted
 unhone apane kaarykaal ke dauraan rajyon ke 378 patr likhe yani prati 16wein din ek chitthee
 Not surprisingly, the first institution to be formed after the Constitution was enacted was the Finance Commission (1951) which determined the nature of the state's economic relations at the Center
 (sandarbhah balvir arora, grenvil austin, bi
 R
 nanda kii kitaaben)2019 ke chunaav se pehle modi is nishkarsh par pahunch gaye the ki unhen 2014 se badi akhil bhartiya lahar chahie
 Those who could defeat the anti-incumbency on which they rode as they went on to win state by state, and who were now turning back against the leadership of alliances
 gathbandhan sarkarein nai nahin hai or na hi unka pradarshan bura rahaa he
 But for the first time, the country's largest party, which has come so far with the help of alliances, is demanding votes for the powerful center by calling the regional parties a threat to the security of the country
 darasal, modi ke aane tak akhil bhartiya lehren (2014 main bhaajapa ko keval 31 fisadi vot mili) itihaas ban chuki thim
 From the sharing of financial rights to electoral representation, the concept of a powerful center has also melted
 shuruaati chunaavon main kshetreey dalon ke paas sansad main lagbhag 35 siten thim jo pichhali loksabhaa main 160 ho gayi
 In the same sequence, their share of votes in Lok Sabha elections increased from 4 percent to 34 percent
 desh main vikaas main rajyon kii bhoomika centre se zyada kendriya ho chuki he
 This is the reason why India's federalism is getting up in just five years compared to the powerful government of majority
 na chaahate hue bhi yah chunaav rajyon kii raajnneeti par kendrit ho rahaa he
 The opposition's return to bjp-ruled states was its beginning
 23 may kaa nateeja chaahe jo ho lekin bhartiya ganatantr kii nai sarkaar shaayad us centre-rajya santulan ko waapas hasil kar legi jo 2014 main ladkadaa gaya tha
 *** dilli main beete dinon 17wein bharat rang mahotsav ke dauraan jon steenbank ke upanyaas par aadhaarit naatak 'of maais and main' kaa manchan kiya gaya
 The play was directed by Hema Singh, while the story of the 'great Recession' in the United States was placed at the center of the story
 yah daur aktubar 1929 ke stock market krash se lekar dwitiya vishwayuddh tak ke shuru hone kaa he
 This recession showed a sharp decline in local jobs and the increase in the number of nomadic workers through drama
 isamen purushon kii sankhya adhik thi, jo shahar-dar-shahar chote-mote kaamon kii talash main bhatakate rahete the
 The play depicts the real hopes and dreams of American workers
 naatak garib or vanchiton ke jivan ko gahare oonche pratikatmak str par khadaa karti he
 Presents a serious lesson of the nature of human existence and touches many topics such as man's dreams, monotony
 naatak ke sabhi paatr kisi na kisi samay main akelepan kaa shikaar the
 During this time, they look helpless and even at that time these characters do not desist from destroying the weaker than themselves
 kahani batalaati he ki daman sirf shaktishaaliyon ke haathon se nahin hota balki daman to koi bhi kar saktaa he
 The power that is used to suppress others
 is naatak ke pramukh paatr george or leni jis farm main rahane kii yojana banaate he, vastav main wo kahin he hi nahin
 But it exists like a real place in these two minds
 yah george or leni ke rishte kaa pratik ban jaataa he or apane sapanom ke bare main baat karte rahanaa unki aadat ban jaati he

 notebandi ke baad bhi bazaar main mudra kaa parichaalan badha he
 The government itself has given this information in the Parliament
 sarkaar ne yah bhi sweekaar kiya he ki bazaar main nakadi jitani adhik hogi, bhrashtachar utana hi adhik hoga
 The government has acknowledged that there is a deep correlation between cash and wrongful activities worldwide
 darasal, saansad ram preet mandal ne loksabhaa main vitt mantri se teen sawaal kiye the
 He had asked whether the currency operations had increased after demonetisation as compared to previous years
 agar haa to vimudrikaran ke shuruyaat or march 2019 tak desh main mudra parichaalan kaa byora kya he
 The MP also asked what negative effects the economy would have on account of the increase in currency operations
 loksabhaa main jawaab dete hue vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne sweekaar kiya ki november 2016 se parichaalan main karency badi he
 He stated that as of November 4, 2016, the total value of the notes was Rs 17,741 billion
 29 march 2019 ke anusaar parichaalan main karency kaa mulya 21,137
 64 billion rupees
 isse pataa chalata he ki notebandi ke baad mudra kaa parichaalan 3396 billian rupee bad gaya
 Let us say here that one billion equals hundred crores
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne yah bhi bataaya ki aarthik samiksha 2016-17 ke khand van main ullekh he ki duniya bhar main nagdi or galat kaaryakalapon ke bich gaharaa rishta paaya jaataa he
 According to Transparency International's assessment, the higher the cash in operation, the higher the corruption
 vitt mantri ke jawaab se mana ja rahaa he ki desh main nagdi parichaalan badhane se bhrashtachar bhi badhane kii ashanka he
 The new song of the multi-starrer film Dil Dhadakne Do has been released for the first time
 is gane ke video menranvir sinhaur anoushka dance karte najar aa rahe hai
 The song has been choreographed by Ranveer and Anushka themselves and in each frame is seen dancing to the beats of the song on its own steps
 is gane ko aawaaj di he sukruti kakkad or siddharth mahadevan ne
 Shankar Ehsaan Loy is the music director of the song and is written by Javed Akhtar
 film'dil dhadkane do'main ranvir singh kabir mehara or anoushka farah ali kaa kirdaar adaa kar rahe hai
 'dil Dhadakne Do' is a story of a Punjabi family who goes on a cruise trip and many incidents happen
 film main anil kapur, shefali shah, ranvir singh, priyanka chopra, anoushka sharma or farhaan akhtar bhi lead role main najar aaenge
 The film is going to release on 5 June 2015
 dekhen film'dil dhadkane do'kaa gaanaa 'pehali baar': While the reverse repo rate, as the name itself suggests, the reverse repo rate is inverted from the repo rate stated above
 ise aise samajhie : bainkon ke paas din bhar ke kaamkaaj ke baad bahut baar ek badi rakam shesh batch jaati he
 Banks can keep that amount in the Reserve Bank to keep with them, on which they also get interest from RBI
 jis dar par yah byaaj unhen miltaa he, use reverse repo rate kehete hai
 However, many times the Reserve Bank feels that there is too much cash in the market, then it increases the reverse repo rate
 isse hota yah he ki bank zyada byaaj kamaane ke liye apana paisa rigerv bank ke paas rakhane lagate hai

 -input IANS While hearing the petition of the disqualified AAP mlas, the Delhi High Court commented on them
 court ne kaha ki lagata he ki parliament secretary banaaye gaye vidhayak dipti ministar ke taur par kaam kar rahe the
 In fact, the court made these remarks after hearing the arguments of the Election Commission, in which the Election Commission, while presenting its stand in the court, said that the staff were even suspended on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Secretary
 iske alaava parliament secretary meeting main ye tak tay karte the ki transport vibhaag main tender ke rate kya rakhe jaaen, parliament secretary kii siforeeshon par dilli sarkaar ke mantriyon ke oesady letters likhakar anek vibhaagon ko jari karte the

 dilli hai court main is maamle main mangalvaar ko bhi sunwaayee jari rahegi
 Advocate Prashant Patel, who has filed a petition in the Election Commission in this case, will also present his case in the court
 saath hi dilli hoicourt ne chunaav ayog kii bahes par aap ke ayogy vidhayakon ko apana paksh rakhane ke liye samay diya he
 Thursday night at 10 Circular Road residence of Rabri Devi and Lalu Prasad in Patna
 30 baje bhi kaaphi gahamagahami he
 The corridor from the main gate to the side finishes by going to the outhouse which has several rooms separated from each other
 rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke warroom kahe jane vaale in kamaron main yadav parivaar apane vafaadaaron ke saath mulaakaat ke alaava yaheen baithkar ranneetiyon par soch-vichaar karata he
 Lalu's first child, 37-year-old Misa Bharti, smiles smilingly even after a grueling 12-hour campaign to push down the half-door of a room
 unki ankhen thakaan se bojhil hai or prachaar kii vyastata ne unhen apane priy serial 'bade achche lagate hai’ se vanchit kar rakhaa he
 But when she turns around in a chair and flips her fingers to message someone on her mobile Samsung Galaxy, she still looks like a decade-old MBBS student for whom the eve of the exam i have a lot to repeat
 misa ne apana siyaasi kariyar aise vakt main shuru kiya he jab argedy ke pehle parivaar ke saamne anginat chunautiyaan khadi ho gai hai
 Lalu Prasad has already lost four of his mlas to arch-rival Nitish Kumar before finalizing the alliance with the Congress and distributing tickets
 ramvilas paswan bijepi ke paale main ja chuke hai, jinhen argedy ne 2010 main rajyasabha main bheja tha
 And, now even the most effective loyalist Ramkripal Yadav has become angry with the election of Misa Bharti as a candidate from Pataliputra seat
 unhen bhi lalu ne 2010 main rajyasabha main bhijwaya tha
 Ramkripal is now on the BJP ticket from Pataliputra against Misa
 haalanki misa kahati hai, ''ham chunautiyon se paar paa lenge
 "she then proudly states," After all, my name is the symbol of one of the most famous movement of independent India
 ” lalu ne apni badi beti kaa naam immergency ke dauraan sabase khatarnaak kanoon mentanence of internal secority act (misa) ke naam par rakhaa tha
 In 1977, when the daughter was born, Lalu was in jail under Misa
 ab 37 saal baad misa apane pita ko duschintaaon or asurakshaon se mukt karne kaa man bana chuki hai
 There have been many legends about this gold medalist MBBS doctor since his father lost the coveted seat of Pataliputra in 2009
 khandaan kii viraasat jab beton tejasvi yadav or tej pratap kii ore khiskaane kii pahal ho chuki thi, aise main unhen vah uttaradhikaar aage badhkar khud hasil karne vaali ek saahasik yoddha bataaya ja rahaa he
 Her initiative is considered to be the initiative of a daughter who was distressed by the father's disintegrating empire
 unhone lalu kii haari loksabhaa seat ko kuch is andaaj main apanaaya ki parivaar ke sabase bharosemand vafaadaar ramkripal yadav bhi dushman ke kheme main pahunch gaye
 This mother of two daughters has come forward to strengthen her father's hand
 beshak, unhen abhi apni kaabiliyat sabit kerani he lekin unamem lalu kii chaturaai or rabari kii sahajata kuta-kuta kar bhari he
 She is quite settled, unlike brother Tejaswi and Tej Pratap
 maa rabari kii tarah ve hameshaa khari-khari bhi nahin boltin, balki soch-samajhakar bolti hai
 She still refers to her former colleagues as her uncles
 party ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''misa mukhar hai or chunautiyon se jujhna pasand karti hai
 He eventually chose Pataliputra from where his father had lost in 2009 while leaving the easy seat Saran for his mother Rabri from where Lalu had won in 2009
 ” party main ye charchaaen bhi hai ki misa kii ichha apane rajnatik kariyar se zyada ranjan yadav ko haraane kii he
 In 2009, Lalu was defeated by Ranjan Yadav on the JD (U) ticket in Patliputra seat
 kabhi ye donon gahare dost the or lalu ne hi unhen rajyasabha main bhijwaya tha
 Shailesh, a degree-holding husband of iima-lucknow of Misa, says, "if Srigesh would have been the aim of a political career, Misa would have chosen the right path of Rajya Sabha
 lekin unhen to logon ke jivan main badlaav laana he
 "misa is getting challenged in Pataliputra from her same uncles whom Lalu sent to the Rajya Sabha from time to time: Ramkripal Yadav and Ranjan Yadav too
 jedy (you) or bijepi ke abhi ummidavaar hi tay ho rahe hai, jabaki misa lagaataar patliputra ke chappe-chappe main gum rahi hai
 Although she is the daughter-in-law of Pataliputra, but she does not have much detailed geographical knowledge of the area
 phir bhi unhone un bahut-si baton ko yaad kar liya he
 For example, where they have to go, whom to meet and what issues to raise
 unke bhaashan puri tarah se swat:sfoort hote hai
 After doing MBBS, she did not do her doctorate but during the campaign she does not forget to keep a niche
 gaanv kii mahilaayein unase milte hi sehat kii chintaaen saajha karne lagati hai
 Misa also does not hesitate in examining her children and advises on medicines and nutritious food
 ve apane bhaashanon main votaron ko swasthya adhikaron kii jaankaree bhi detii hai
 Misa's image was made of a progressive woman to take the party's image beyond old politics
 vaise to misa kaa focus patliputra hi he lekin party samarthak unke oonche lakshya kii ore ishaara karte hai
 Now these are the early days in politics for him, so he has to balance his personal and party activities
 ve is sawaal se bifer padati hai ki parivaar kii majaburiyon ne unhen raajnneeti main utarane par baadhya kiya
 She says, "yes, i am the daughter of Lalu ji, that is a great ability in itself
" lekin isse mujhe atirikt daayitv bodh or chunautiyaan bhi mil jaati hai
 i learned to breathe in the middle of politics
 netaaon ke bacchon ke bhi rajnatik adhikaar hai
 What should not happen? ”she also admits that her decision to contest elections had already been made two years ago
 pichley saal lalu jail gaye to faisla pakkaa ho gaya kyonki ve chunaav nahin lard sakate
 Although Ramkripal indicates that party leaders were aware of his desire to fight with Pataliputra, the truth is that everyone in the party was also aware of Misa contesting from Pataliputra
 argedy netaa kehete hai, ''ham sabhi chah maheene pehle se jaanate the ki misa patliputra se ladengi
 Those who know Misa praise her political intelligence
 lalu ke tikaton ke elaan ke baad ramkripal khafa ho gaye to ve unke ghar unhen manaane pahunch gayi or tivi camaron kii najar main puure chah ghante intjaar karti raheen
 He also offered to give his ticket to Ramkripal
 jab ramkripal is jaal main funs gaye or ladgaye kii baat sweekaar kar lee to lalu ne manaa kar diya
 Misa then agreed with her father's decision
 ab, ve har maukey par party ke varisht netaaon abdul baari siddiki or raghuvansh prasad singh kii saraahna karti hai
 These leaders never bowed down to Lalu and maintained their independent status
 misa ko raajnneeti ke prati jajba shaayad viraasat main mila he
 She was also a badminton champion during MBBS days
 unhone khel main kariyar banane yaa bal rog visheshgy banane kii bhi sochi thi
 But with the passage of time, Misa has returned to her political roots
 lekin yah baat ab bhi saaf nahin he ki kya lalu ne vaaki misa ko hi apana rajnatik uttaradhikari bana diya he
 It is not hidden from anyone that younger son Tejashwi is his first choice
 jab lalu jail gaye to tejasvi apni mummy ke saath media ke camaron kaa saamana kar rahe the
 It is a matter of fact that his age is not yet worth fighting for Lok Sabha elections, so Misa has taken command
 lalu jab jail main the tab bhi is tarah kii khabaren aa raheen thi ki misa raajnneeti main sakriy bhoomika nibhaana chaahati hai
 Now she is in the election field and this young doctor has to prove whether she can hold the pulse of politics or not
 kendriya mahila or bal vikaas mantrimenka gandhinesabarimala mandirkosupreme courtke faisle ko aitihaasik qaraar diya he
 He said that it is a very good thing that keeps Hinduism united

 All the rules laid down who will go here and who will not go here
 mantri ne kaha ki mandir main jati, dharm or stri ke pravesh pabandi ek tarah se dharmik thekedaari he
 God is for everyone
 khaastaur par jab hindu dharm main aurat ko jab shakti mana jaataa he to koun manaa kar saktaa he ki shakti hi mandir main na jaae
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, Maneka Gandhi said for whom is God? This decision of the Supreme Court is historic
 kyonki yah hinduism ko vistaar detaa he
 Makes it modern

 kareeb 800 saal puraane is mandir main ye manyata pichley kaaphi samay se chal rahi thi ki mahilaon ko mandir main pravesh naa karne diya jaae
 Chief Justice Deepak Mishra, Justice Chandrachud, Justice Nariman, Justice Khanwilkar ruled in favor of women by one vote
 jabaki justise indu malhotra ne sabarimala mandir ke paksh main faisla sunaaya
 Reading the judgment, Chief Justice Deepak Mishra said that gender discrimination cannot be done in the name of faith
 kanoon or samaaj kaa kaam sabhi ko barabari se dekhne kaa he
 The double standards for women reduce their respect
 chif justise ne kaha ki bhagwaan ayappa ke bhakton ko alag-alag dharmon main nahin baant sakate hai

 The former commissioner in his letter also attacked the bureaucracy, saying that it was adopting a stubborn attitude and in many cases it was felt that the commissioners were not determined about transparency

 Shailesh Gandhi said in the letter, 'the orders of the commissioners are often biased against transparency and the cases get clogged because of not timely disposal of cases by them

 Mamta says that the BJP has invited the dead activists to the family and termed it a political murder
 jabaki ye raajnneetik hatyaein nahin hai balki aapasi ranjishon ke masale hai
 After this, bjp's IT in-charge Amit Malviya attacked Mamata Banerjee and reminded her that she (mamata Banerjee) had called the families of those killed in political violence at her 2011 swearing-in ceremony
 malviya ne twit main daawa kiya, mamata banerjee ke 20 may 2011 ke shapath grahan main raajnneetik hinsa main maare gaye logon ke parijan shaamil hue the
 These people were killed in Nandigram and Singur
 unhone tab vam morche par nrushans hatya karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Whereas Mamta is now alleging that bjp's invitation to swearing is unfounded
 Mamata Banerjee’ own oath-taking on May 20, 2011, was attended by the families of “victims of political violence in Nandigram and Singur”
 She had accused the Left Front of letting loose a reign of terror then
 
 
 So her charge that BJP has devalued an “august occasion” is hollow
 - Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) May 29, 2019 Mamta Banerjee, expressing her opposition, wrote in the letter, 'congratulations, new Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 But in recent times i have seen reports that Bharatiya Janata Party is saying that they have also invited the family of 54 BJP workers who have been politically murdered in Bengal
 ’mamata ne likhaa ki ye bilkul jhooth he, bengal main koi raajnneetik hatya nahin hui he
 These murders have been caused by mutual enmity, family fighting and other issues
 inkaa raajnneeti se koi lenaa-dena nahin he, aisa koi record bhi nahin he
 Sorry Narendra Modi ji, that is why i will not be able to attend your swearing-in ceremony

 ) gujarat main 1998 se lekar 2012 tak har baar bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar bani
 Even in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had a weak edge
 narendra modi kii entry ke baad soobe kii raajnneeti main bhagava paracham har disha main urj par aata chalaa gaya
 The party became so strong that the Congress did not get an opportunity to come even near the comeback
 magar, is baar halaat juda hai
 Narendra Modi has now become Prime Minister
 unke sabase bharosemand ranneetikaar amit shah bhi rashtriya raajnneeti kaa hissaa ban gaye hai
 bjp's policies are also strongly opposed in Gujarat
 patel, obisi, dalit or muslim samet samaaj ke kai bade tabake sattadhari dal ke prati asantusht najar aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Congress, which is based on political Sahil, has given a lot of emphasis on the strategy for the upcoming assembly elections under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi
 chunaav prachaar se lekar tikat bantwaare par bhi iskaa asar najar aayaa he
 The Congress has also shown aggression in campaigning and selection of candidates
 bijepi ke kaddavar pratyaashee ke rutabe or kad ko dhyaan main rakhte hue congress ne apane candidet tay kiye hai
 Its hallmark is seen in Rajkot East seat
 vahiin porbandar main bhi congress ne isi ranneeti ke tahat faisla liya he
 The Congress has once again shown confidence in its strongman Arjun Modhwadia from Porbandar seat
 bijepi kii list ke baad ummidavaaron ke naam tay karnaa bhi congress kii isi ranneeti kaa hissaa maani ja rahaa he
 History of Porbandar seat: In 1995, Babubhai Bhimabhai Bokhiriya defeated Congress's Shashikant Anandlal on this seat
 iske baad 1998 main unhone congress ke ummidavaar shyaal heeralaal gagan ko maat di
 However, the 2002 election was defeated by him
 is baar congress ne arjuna modhwadiya ko pratyaashee banaaya or unhone babubhai ko haraa diya
 Even in 2007, Arjun Modhwadia won this seat
 iske baad 2012 main babubhai bokhiria ne kambek kiya or wo apni seat bachaane main kaamyaab rahe
 He defeated Arjun Modhwadia by about 17 thousand votes
 babu bokhiria bijepi ke taqatvar mantri hai, baavjood iske modhwadiya ko congress ne tikat diya he
 Although he lost the last election, but political experts believe that only big leaders like Arjun Modhwadia can defeat Babu Bokhiria
 yahi vajah he ki congress ne apane varisht netaa ke liye koi surakshit seat talashne ke bajaay babu bokhiria ke khilaaf utarkar yah chunauti sweekaar kii he
 In view of the UP assembly elections, PM Modi arrived in Lakhimpur Kheri on Monday where he said that when the socialist's net was cleaned in 2014, now he got involved in the alliance and the family was also shattered
 ab sapa congress kii sharan main baith gai
 The SP, Manohar Lohia, who fought against the Congress throughout his life, has humiliated him today
 sirf kursi ke moh main sapa congress kii god main baith gai he
 Raising the issue of farmers, he said that the largest district of UP is Lakhimpur Kheri
 ise chini kaa katoraa kaha jaataa rahaa he
 Who stopped UP CM Akhilesh Yadav from paying the dues of the farmers here
 kisaanon ke haq ko chhina gaya he
 The PM also said that if the BJP government is formed then the debt of farmers will be waived in the very first meeting
 pehle charan ke matdaan par baat karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki 'pratham charan main karaara matdaan hua he, vikram matdaan hua he
 The stance of the first phase has clearly stated that no matter how many alliances the SP will survive
 jab unhen pataa chalaa ki pratham charan main aisa hua to unhen teesraa ghoshnaptr jari karnaa padaa

 The comments unhone kaha ki jab madam mayawati kii sarkaar thi tab 2010-12 ke bich main upi ke 23 gaanv main bijli bhejne kaa kaam kiya gaya
 While addressing Akhilesh Yadav as Rajkumar, PM Modi said that in his government in 2012-14, the work of Akhilesh government in UP spoke something like this
 is dauraan in noujvaan mukhyamantri ne do saal main keval 3 gaanv main bijli pahunchaai

 Talking about the first phase of voting, PM Modi said that in the first phase there has been a bitter turnout, Vikram polling has taken place
 pehle charan ke rukh ne saaf-saaf bataa diya he ki kitne bhi gathbandhan ho jaae sapa batch nahin paaegi
 When he came to know that it happened in the first phase, he had to issue a third manifesto

 During the Emergency, Mrs Gandhi raised 20 issues and did not get a single seat
 ab ye 10 mudde lekar aae hai tab bhi kuch nahin hoga
 They do not see any hope now
 ' PM Modi said that Akhilesh Yadav has been in government in UP for five years, now he should give account of work for five years

 Belgium defeated England 2–0 in the FIFA World Cup third-place match played at the St
 Petersburg Stadium on Saturday
 donon timen ek samay khitaab kii prabal daavedaar maani ja rahi thim, lekin semifinal main mili haar ke baad se in donon ke liye tisare sthaan kaa match sabase bada match ban gaya tha, jahaan belgium ko safalataa haath lagi
 Belgium was aggressive from the start and weakened England's defense and attack
 belgium ne chauthe minute main hi gol kar england ko sakate main daal diya
 For him, this miracle was done by returning Thomas Munier
 thomas pehle semifinal match main baahar the
 He scored this goal on a low cross pass by Nasser Chadli from the left side
 thomas gol ke saamne hi khadey the
 He put the ball in the net with great ease and gave his team a lead
 12wein minute main belgium ne apni badhat ko doguna kar liya hota, lekin england ke golkeeper jordan pickford ne kevin di brune ke shot ko shandaar tareeke se bachaate hue gol nakaar diya
 Belgium continued to attack and exert pressure on England
 isi bich 23wein minute main rahim ko mauka mila tha ki vah england ke liye barabari kaa gol kar den
 However he missed
 35wein minute main belgium ko pehla corner mila
 Here Toby Alderweireld sat the ball up the game
 pehle half main england ne gend to apane paas zyada rakhi, lekin vah gol karne ke maukey nahin bana pai or jo maukey uske haath aae bhi, unhen vah finish nahin de pai
 This story of the first half continued in the second half as well
 england ke khilaadi chaahe vah harry ken hon, jese linguard hon, kir tripir hon yaa marcus reshford, sabhi maukon ko anjaam tak nahin pahunchaa paa rahe the
 England also got some corners, which he passed
 kisi tarah 70wein minute main erik diar ne reshaford ke saath milakar ek move banaaya, jo of said qaraar de diya gaya
 Three minutes later, Daire made another move and, with the help of Tripir, passed it to Lingard, who sat him over the bar
 england kaa atake to kamjor tha hi saath hi uskaa dephence bhi kaam nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 However, their goalkeeper Pickford made a brilliant defense in the 80th minute to not allow Belgium to score a second goal
 is minute main di brune ne gend eden hejard ko di, jinhone munior ko paas diya
 Munier's brilliant shot was stopped by Pickford with a dive
 pickford haalanki 82wein minute main gol hone se nahin roak paae
 This time Hazard put the ball from De Bruyne into the net to put Belgium ahead 2–0
 match kaa nateeja bhi yahi rahaa

 It is a strange coincidence that Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Mulayam Singh Yadav gave a hundred out of a hundred to his son and state Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav in a review of the first hundred days' tenure, then suddenly 'hardened' and expressed displeasure at the government's functioning
 Taking the stern stance in the meeting of the Executive and the Executive, the Minister, mlas and party workers have been advised to improve their conduct by remaining disciplined
 vaise bhi pradesh kii janata ne bahujan samaaj party (basapa) kii 'bahan ji' se satta chhinakar sapa ke 'tipu bhaiya' ko saunpte samay unki 'ummid kii cycle' par had se zyada 'ummid' kii thi
 However, the assessment of the work of four and a half months did not make much difference between the erstwhile Mayawati government and this government, it is good that SP President Mulayam Singh Yadav went to Chet in time and gave a lesson of discipline to the ministers, mlas and workers in the party executive meeting
 Taught it
 varanaa, aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav kii baitarani paar karne main baari mashkkat kerani pad sakati thi
 Despite all this, one thing is not understood that a month ago, the SP chief gave the Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav hundred out of a hundred on the completion of hundred days of the government, a few days before he questioned the functioning of the government
 Expressed 'displeasure'
 mulaayam ab achaanak 'kathor' ho gaye or sabhi ko anushaasan ke daayre main rahakar apane 'aacharan' main sudhaar karne par bal diya
 Mulayam Singh Yadav's stance at the state executive meeting held in Lucknow on Saturday clearly shows that there has been a big change in the thinking of the three sections (ministers, legislators and workers) associated with the government and the party, which does not match the socialist ideology
 
 rahi baat anushaasanheenata kii to yah pramaan akhilesh ke shapath lete hi mil gaya tha, jab ati utsahit kaaryakarta manch par chadh gaye the
 Gaya Charan Dinkar, Deputy Leader of BSP Legislative Party in Uttar Pradesh Assembly and MLA from Naraini seat of Banda district, says, "by teaching discipline to his government's ministers, mlas and activists, Mulayam has strengthened the bsp's apprehension that the election During the period, the BSP had expressed the possibility of establishing 'gundaraj' when the SP came to power
 "vah kehete hai ki akhilesh sarkaar ke saadhe chaar maah 'bahan ji' dwaara sanchalit jan kalyankari yojanaon ke naam badalane main hi beetaa he
 Elderly political analyst Ranveer Singh Chauhan believes that Mulayam has caught the opposition sitting at home in the executive meeting by giving such advice
 vah kehete hai, "basapa, bhaajapa or congress shuru se hi sapa kaaryakartaaon par anushaasanheenata or uddandata karne ke aarope lagaati rahi hai, jise ek tarah se mulaayam ne sweekaara he
 "overall, it would not be wrong to say that Mulayam Singh, unhappy with the son's government, has now become 'hardened' not 'mulayam', if in time people associated with the government have not improved their 'conduct' and shown themselves to be 'socialist'
 Then they may have to bear the brunt

 ek reporter ke saath 'fes time' karte hue turki ke raashtrapati erdogaan kii jis ek tasviir par sabase zyaada charchaa ho rahi he, vah isliye ho rahi he kyonki khud unhone hi twitor kii tulana 'hatyare ke chure' se kii thi, kaha tha- vah twit-smit nahin karte or qasam khai thi ki desh se twitor kaa namonishaan mitaa denge
 He suspected that social media had an important role to play in uniting people in protest against him in 2013
 lekin vakt padane par isi soshal media ne unki sarkaar bachaa lee
 The video streaming service on Facebook and Twitter has given the power in the hands of common people that they can broadcast live from where they stand
 turki main yahi hua
 After the failed coup attempt in Turkey, what is being discussed the most is the role of social media in it
 sienen tark channel ke reporter se fes time ke zarie eradoan ne desh ko sambodhit kiya
 The time was not long enough for obs and cameras to wait for the live broadcast
 sarkari tivi stesan tiarti par qabza kar kar desh bhar main karfue kaa elaan or logon ko gharon main rahane kii chetavanee jari kar chuke the
 Every moment was valuable and the message was to be conveyed to the public
 takhta palat kii koshish ke shuruaati 20 minute baad hi aiphone par fes time ke saath saath erdogaan ne twit bhi kiya ki aam log sadakon par nikalen or is takhta palat ko naakaam karen
 Same thing happened
 log hazaron kii sankhya main sadakon par nikle, tinkon ke aage let gaye, goliyon kaa saamana kiya or loktantric tareeqe se chuni sarkaar bachaa lee
 The comments fesabook live or twitor ke periscope tivi ke zarie ankara or istambul kii sadakon par se aam log is takhta palat kii koshish or aam logon ke iske kilaaf khadey hone ko lagaataar live dikhaaya
 Neither live TV was required nor did anything else
 twitor par hi erdogaan ke alaava pradhanmantri bin ali yildarim ne logon ko bataaya ki fuj kaa sirf ek hissaa isamen shaamil he or sarkaar control main he
 Opposition also announced to stand with the government on this social media
 logon ke sadak par utarane or tinkon par chadhakar vidrohi sainikon kii pitayee tak or phir unke haath khadey kar tanks chhodane ke drishyon ne jataa diya ki takhta palat kii koshish kis tarah naakaam rahi he
 These pictures, being continuously posted on social media, kept not only Turkey but the whole world aware of every event on real time basis
 kehete hai ki soochna main taaqat hoti he
 These information came heavily on the claims of a coup of the rebel military group
 duvidha kaa daur lanbaa nahin chalaa or erdogaan satta bachaane main kaamyaab rahe
 And the twentieth-century attempt to overturn this power was defeated by the technology of the 21st century
 kul mila kar soshal media kii bhoomika sarkaar ke samarthan main khadey un surakshakarmiyon or police ke kahin zyaada rahi jisane vidrohiyon ke pair ukhaad die

 sienen tark channel ke reporter se fes time ke zarie eradoan ne desh ko sambodhit kiya
 The time was not long enough for obs and cameras to wait for the live broadcast
 sarkari tivi stesan tiarti par qabza kar kar desh bhar main karfue kaa elaan or logon ko gharon main rahane kii chetavanee jari kar chuke the
 Every moment was valuable and the message was to be conveyed to the public
 takhta palat kii koshish ke shuruaati 20 minute baad hi aiphone par fes time ke saath saath erdogaan ne twit bhi kiya ki aam log sadakon par nikalen or is takhta palat ko naakaam karen
 Same thing happened
 log hazaron kii sankhya main sadakon par nikle, tinkon ke aage let gaye, goliyon kaa saamana kiya or loktantric tareeqe se chuni sarkaar bachaa lee
 The comments fesabook live or twitor ke periscope tivi ke zarie ankara or istambul kii sadakon par se aam log is takhta palat kii koshish or aam logon ke iske kilaaf khadey hone ko lagaataar live dikhaaya
 Neither live TV was required nor did anything else
 twitor par hi erdogaan ke alaava pradhanmantri bin ali yildarim ne logon ko bataaya ki fuj kaa sirf ek hissaa isamen shaamil he or sarkaar control main he
 Opposition also announced to stand with the government on this social media
 logon ke sadak par utarane or tinkon par chadhakar vidrohi sainikon kii pitayee tak or phir unke haath khadey kar tanks chhodane ke drishyon ne jataa diya ki takhta palat kii koshish kis tarah naakaam rahi he
 These pictures, being continuously posted on social media, kept not only Turkey but the whole world aware of every event on real time basis
 kehete hai ki soochna main taaqat hoti he
 These information came heavily on the claims of a coup of the rebel military group
 duvidha kaa daur lanbaa nahin chalaa or erdogaan satta bachaane main kaamyaab rahe
 And the twentieth-century attempt to overturn this power was defeated by the technology of the 21st century
 kul mila kar soshal media kii bhoomika sarkaar ke samarthan main khadey un surakshakarmiyon or police ke kahin zyaada rahi jisane vidrohiyon ke pair ukhaad die
 Through the Periscope TV of Facebook Live and Twitter, the common people from the streets of Ankara and Istanbul tried to overthrow this coup and continued to stand against it
 naa live tivi kii zarurat padi or naa kisi or chiz kii
 Apart from Erdogan on Twitter itself, Prime Minister bin Ali Yildirim told the people that only part of the army is involved in it and the government is under control
 vipaksh ne bhi sarkaar ke saath khadey hone kaa elaan isi soshal media par kiya
 The scenes of people trying to get on the road and beat up the rebel soldiers by climbing on the tanks and then leaving the tank standing in their hands showed how the coup attempt had failed
 soshal media par lagaataar post ho rahi in tasveeron ne na sirf turki balki puri duniya ko real time basis par har ghatnakram se rubaru rakhaa
 It is said that there is strength in information
 vidrohi sainik gut ke takhta palat ke daavon par ye suchanaaen baari padi
 The dilemma did not last long and Erdogan managed to save power
 or beesvin sadi kii is satta palat kii koshish ko 21veen sadi kii technology ne maat de di
 Overall, the role of social media was more than that of the security personnel and police standing in support of the government, who uprooted the rebels

 According to sources, after choosing faces from its equation, the party is now thinking of proposing reservation for backward upper castes of every religion for 10 per cent
 khaas baat ye he ki, har dharm ke jariye garib muslimon ko isamen shaamil kiya jaayegaa
 It is clear that the Congress wants to strengthen its equation at all costs
 congress netaa pramod tiwari ne kaha ki congress ne hi daliton or pichhadon ko aarakshan diya, unhone kaha ki agar maang uthegi to party uchit forum par is par vichaar karegi or faisla karegi
 sonia-rahul will show the green flag Meanwhile, due to the sudden issue of Dalit issue in the Congress, the Congress has extended its campaign in UP for a day

 The program of stopping in the first night has now been changed to Moradabad instead of Bareilly, the rest will remain the same
 vahiin 23 july ko sonia or rahul gandhi yatra ko hari jhandi dikhaakar ravaanaa karenge
 This proposal was given in front of Rahul and Priyanka
 The new team of UP Congress gave this proposal in front of Rahul and Priyanka in this regard, on which both have given in principle consent
 bhavishya main isko party apane ghoshnaptr main shaamil karegi
 The party feels that through this, it can drag the upper caste youth of Hindu and Muslim class into its court
 masaude par ho rahi maathapaiparty alaakaman ne upi ke netaaon ko do took kaha he ki philhal aarakshan kii jo vyavastha he, usase kisi kism kii chhedchhad nahin kii jaaegi
 The draft of how the 10% reservation will be given to the poor upper castes should also be brought out, so that the public can be confident that it is not just an election promise
 kaaryakartaaon or janata kii raay bhi lee jaegiparty apana ghoshnaptr kaaryakartaaon or janata ke vibhinn virgon kii raay lekar hi banaaegi
 That is why in this case also it will be put in the manifesto only after taking the opinion of party workers and public

 The party was also facing various allegations of Muslim appeasement

 After that, the Antony Committee, formed to review the debacle of the Lok Sabha elections, had attributed the pro-muslim image of the party to the public
 isiilie ab party phoonk-phoonk kar kadam badha rahi he
 In an attempt to break her old image too, she has now brought this new Shigufa

 On Diwali, a large amount of garbage was collected on the streets due to burst firecrackers in Delhi, which was picked up by the MCD the next day to landfill sites
 diwali ke agle din dilli kii teenon emsidi se mili jaankaree ke anusaar dilli kii sadakon se kul chah hajaar metric ton se zyada kooda uthaaya gaya
 If we talk about the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, then the Corporation's Dems Department raised 1,143 metric tonnes of waste from the areas of East Delhi
 shuukravaar shaam chaar baje tak shahdara north jone ke ilaakon se 625 metric or shahdara south jone ke ilaakon se 518 metric ton kooda uthaaya gaya
 Apart from this, there were complaints of not picking up garbage from many areas of East Delhi
 iske baad in ilaakon main meyar nima bhagat ne khud apni dekharekh main kooda uthvaaya
 After receiving a complaint from the mayor, 15 autotipers were employed to garbage
 iske atirikt south emsidi dames vibhaag ne kareeb 3,850 metric ton kooda uthaaya
 According to the corporation, 3,850 metric tonnes of garbage was not only picked up, but the garbage was disposed of in such a way that a very small amount of garbage reached the landfill site
 vahiin, north dilli ke ilaakon main bhi diwali par ek hajaar metric ton se zyada kooda jamaa ho gaya tha
 On Friday, the North MCD transported 1,040 metric tonnes of waste to the Bhalswa landfill site

 As a precautionary measure in Kashmir, authorities have banned all mobile telephone services except the postpaid facility of government BSNL on Friday
 aisa pichley saptaah shuukravaar kii namaaj ke baad hui hinsak jhadpon ko dekhte hue kiya gaya he
 Today, the mobile Internet facility has come to a standstill for the 35th consecutive day
 ek police adhikari ne bataaya, 'puri ghati main mobile internet sevaaon ko thap kar diya gaya he
 Only bsnl's postpaid service is working
 ' unhone bataaya ki kanoon or vyavastha banaae rakhane or afvaah se bachane ke liye madhyaraatri main puri ghati main seva ko band kar diya gaya
 Violent clashes between protesters and security forces were witnessed at several places in the valley after mass prayers last Friday
 in jhadpon main teen logon kii maut ho gai thi or saikadon anya ghayal ho gaye the
 All mobile telephone services, except bsnl's postpaid service, were shut down in the valley on 15 July following violence that erupted following the death of Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani in an encounter in South Kashmir's Anantnag district on July 8
 adhikariyon ne nau july ko puri ghati main mobile internet suvidha band kar di thi
 The comments 26 july ko postped sevaayen behaal kar di gai thim or iske ek din baad preeped numberon par inakming suvidha shuru kar di gai thi, lekin preeped par outgowing suvidha band hi rahi

 'he said that to maintain law and order and to avoid rumors, the service was discontinued in the entire valley at midnight

 a similar thing happened a few years ago with the decision on Haji Ali, where the ban on gender grounds was actually the exact opposite of the spirit of Sufism
 sufiwaad main to sangrakshak sant sabhi panth kii auraton or mardon kaa swaagat karte rahe hai
 According to media reports, there have been large-scale protests in Pathanamthitta district on the call of the Pandalam royal family against the decision on Sabarimala
 patrakaron ne dikhaaya ki in pradarshnon main bade paimaane par mahilaayein bhi shaamil hui hai
 The truth is that she was shouting slogans against a decision that has protected her dignity and that is why it is ironic
 in sabko dekhte hue yah sawaal uthaaya ja saktaa he ki islam ke bare main kya ho? quran kaa sura al bakar mahilaon kii maahvaaree ke bare main saaf tareeke se baat karata haih "he paigambar, ve aapse maahvaaree ke bare main puuchhenge to unhen bataanaa ki yah ek "adhan'' (pidaa) kaa samay he
 It would be better for them (men) to stay away from them (women) (do not have sex), until they complete their ayyam (menstrual days) and clean themselves
 ''mahilaon ko dharm se jude kisi bhi kaamkaaj main shaamil hone se rokane ke liye sadiyon se inhen panktiyon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The word "yat-horn", meaning "clean, holy", is used to indicate that she was "dirty" before cleaning
 namaaj adaa karne se pehle mard or aurat khud ko saaf-suthra karenge, yah quran kii hidaayat he, jiskaa aashay namaaj adaa karne se pehle maahvaaree yaa yon sambandh ke baad sharir se nikalne vaale taral padaarthon ko saaf karne se he
 i have not seen even a single line clearly written in the Quran that such women should be kept away from religious works
 mardon dwaara kuran ke liye pesh kii gai zyaadaatar vyakhyaaon main arabi shabd "adhan'' kaa matlab "pradooshan'' bataaya gaya he
 This sense has opened the way to gender discrimination
 mard is shabd kaa istemaal "napaki'' (gandagi) ke liye karte hai, iskaa istemaal auraton par niyantran or badhaane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 In all matters related to religion, women are considered inferior because they have menstruation
 mard shreshth he, kyonki use maahvaaree nahin aati
 This is an essential condition of this argument
 pichley varshon main maine islam kii vyakhya ke liye sirf or sirf quran sikhi he
 i trust only one interpreter of this, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, who is a man
 mere jaise karodon log moulana ko sabase udaar or gyani vyakti ke rup main jaanate hai
 Nobody can question his style of Quran
 aaazaad kaa kahana he ki maahvaaree ke dinon main duuri banane kii baat isliye nahin he ki aurat "napak'' ho jaati he, balki isliye ki un dinon main yon sambandh bananaa "mujir'' (nuksandeh) mana jaataa he
 In the same light, it can be claimed that fasting of Ramadan during menstruation can be difficult, or that "main and" sijda "" during namaz can be difficult
 lekin pitrusatta ne kuch shabdon ko pakad liya or aise dinon main mahilaon ke liye kai kaaryon par bandish laga di
 When i reached the threshold of puberty and my menstruation started, i was asked not to offer Namaz in those days
 maahvaaree chakra ke din puure hone ke baad mujhe ek khaas tareeke se nahaane kaa nirdesh diya gaya tha
 When Ramadan comes, i would be told not to keep fast during those "evil" days and not to touch the Quran
 ye sab nirdesh agali peedhishon tak bina soche-samajhe pahunchaa die jate hai
 While visiting Sufi tombs like Nizamuddin Auliya or Ajmer Sharif Dargah, i was not allowed to visit the inner sanctum, where men could freely move
 srinagar ke hazratbal kii vah meri duusari yatra thi, jab kuch khatka
 i got very angry when i was stopped from going inside
 isi tarah madina main bhi main iske liye taiyaar nahin thi, jab mujhe bahari line main jane ko kaha gaya, jo paigambar kii majaar se kaaphi dur thi or mardon ko bilkul kareeb tak jane kii ijaajat thi

 The Congress and CPM have accused the government of misuse of public broadcasters, while the BJP has defended it by saying that the Sangh has truly contributed to patriotism and has always spoken of the philosophy of 'justice for all'
 jaavdekar ne ravivaar ko ek samvaadadaata sammelan main prashnon kaa uttar dete hue kaha, ‘doordarshan ek swytt santhaan he or ham isamen vyavsaayikta laana chaahate hai
