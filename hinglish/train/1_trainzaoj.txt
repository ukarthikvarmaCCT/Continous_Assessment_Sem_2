 Out of the 543 Lok Sabha constituencies in the country, 80% of the Muslim population is 20 percent

 Mohammad Khan, assistant professor of political science at Ashoka University, says, "muslims have always voted based on local issues and candidates and not as a group
" koi aankada aisa nahin he jo muslim vot bank ke myth yaa aitihaasik pattern kaa samarthan karata ho
 "many argue that the voting pattern of Muslim voters is driven by the politics of that particular constituency, not by the anti-muslim rhetoric and fear shown by events
 hinduon kii tarah jameen par muslim pahchaan kaa mudda bhi atyadhik khandit he jo dharmik, bhashaai, jati or varg ke saath badalata rahata he
 Where the last few elections have seen increasing numbers of Hindu votes in favor of BJP
 muslim vot congress or anya majboot kshetreey rajnatik dalon ke bich vibhajit ho gaye hai
 In states where Congress is in direct competition with BJP, it gets a large number of Muslim votes

 Many political experts believe that 2019 will be an important year for Muslim voters

 If Congress President Rahul Gandhi has declared himself to be a Janaudhari Shiv Devotee and has been publicly circling from one temple to another in 2015, then SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has reacted to the bjp's Ram temple statement They will build a huge Vishnu temple in their region Etawah and settle Vishnu Nagar

 Syed Arshad Madani, president of jamiat-e-ulema-e-hind, says, "the party and leaders do not even talk about giving rights to Muslims
" nehru-gandhiyon ne kabhi dharm kii baat nahin kii thi lekin aaj ve apni hindu pahchaan kii numaaish kar rahe hai
 "this is seen as a direct response to the RSS-BJP allegations of 'secular parties' doing 'muslim appeasement' politics
 isse bhaajapa ko hindu vot ko majboot karne main madad mili he or anya dalon ke liye bahusankhyak hinduon ke voton ko khatre main daal diya he
 "the BJP specializes in polarization and other parties are trapped in its trap," says Verniers
 yahi kaaran he ki congress ne khule taur par kaha ki use us dharna ko dur karne kii jarurat he ki vah muslim samarthak he
 "but Muslim leaders hold the Congress equally responsible for causing this situation
 madani kehete hai, ''upie shashan ke dauraan jab shivaraj patil grih mantri the, tab kai visphot hue or sarkaar ne huji or simi ko doshi tehraaya
 Many Muslims were detained, severely interrogated and there was a perception that Muslims were terrorists
 congress ne pichley 60 saal main musalamaanon ke khilaaf yah sabase zyada nuksandeh kaam kiya he
 "most scholars agree that the current pathetic socio-economic condition of Muslims is a result of the political class's continuing apathy towards their issues
 dilli main centre for da study of develping societes ke associat professor hilaal ahamed kehete hai, ''tathakthith dharmanirpeksh dalon or samudaay kii numaaindgi kaa daawa karne vaale muslim rajnatik abhijatya varg ne pahchaan aadhaarit utpeeda kii baat ko jaan-boojhkar badha-chadhaakar pesh kiya or musalamaanon kii asal pareshaaniyon ko gaayab kar diya

 "where are the Muslim leaders? In 2012, in a conversation with a group of Muslim youth, Rahul Gandhi asked why the Muslim community could not emerge as the second leader in the stature of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, India's first education minister? Political observers believe It is said that if the answer to this question is found, then the responsibility of this failure will also come in the account of his party
 varnears kehete hai, ''vibhaajan ke baad se musalamaanon main kuleen varg kii kami ho gai he kyonki unamem se adhikansh pakistan chale gaye
 Two other factors exacerbated this problem
 aazaadee ke baad ke chunavi paridrishy par haaavee rahi congress ko muslim vot to chahie the lekin vah unhen paryaapt pratinidhitiv dene ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 This trend lasted for several decades
 "ol india-majalis-e-ittehadul muslimin (eiemiem) ke pramukh asaduddin ovaisi is baat se sahamat haih ''koi netaa achaanak na to aasmaan se tapak saktaa he, na jameen fadkar nikal saktaa he, use ubharna hota he
 Political parties are not ready to give seats and tickets to Muslims
 aise main puure bharat main asar rakhane vaale muslim netaa kaise ubhar sakate hai?"aazaadee ke baad se bhartiya musalamaanon ne congress, sapa, basapa, trinmul or rajd jaise dharmanirpeksh dalon kaa samarthan kiya he
 These parties describe themselves as Muslims friendly but when it comes to giving them representation in proportion to the population, they are left behind
 1952-1977 ke congress-varchasv vaale varshon main sansad main muslim pratinidhitiv 2-7 pratishat tha
 It increased to 10 percent in 1980, its highest level ever
 phir bhi yah musalamaanon kii kul pratishat aabaadi ke anupaat main kam tha
 Muslim representation in the Assembly in UP, highest level in 2012, led by SP 17
 1 pratishat par rahaa, lekin yah bhi unki aabaadi ke kul hisse se kam tha
 In Bihar, where most of the Congress, Janata Dal (united) and RJD ruled, the highest Muslim representation was 10 in 1985
 46 fisadi rahaa
 Several Muslim-centric parties, such as AIMIM, the Indian Union Muslim League and the All India United Democratic Front, emerged as a result of the Congress losing its trust and the failure of regional secular parties
 lekin ye partiyaan ek khaas kshetra tak hi simati hui hai
 AIMIM tries to be the most vocal about Muslim issues and has also tried to establish its roots in Maharashtra, UP and Bihar, but still remains a Hyderabad-based party
 2008 ke baad kai muslim partiyon kaa janm (box dekhen) hua jisase muslim voton main or bikharaav hua
 There is also dissatisfaction with the Muslim leaders as they failed to highlight the real issues causing trouble to the community
 16 muslim sanghathanon kii sanstha ol india muslim majalis-e-mashaavrat ke adhyaksh naved hamid kehete hai, ''vibhinn dalon main muslim netaa musalamaanon ke pratinidhi nahin hai kyonki ve aksar musalamaanon kii chintaa ko saamne rakhane kii bajaae party line ke aage ghutane tech dete hai
 "although they clearly state that they are not Muslim leaders but Owaisi has emerged as the biggest star in Muslim politics today

 In a democracy, it is good that the marginalized parties come together and unite against those who practice right-wing politics and discriminate against us
 "musalmaan or bhaajapa2014 main, bhaajapa satta main ai lekin uske paas ek bhi nirvaachit muslim saansad nahin tha
 The party won 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP — a state where 20 percent of the population is Muslim — without fielding any Muslim candidate; None of the 55 Muslim candidates from other parties won
 2017 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ne ek bhi muslim ummidavaar nahin utaara, phir bhi 403 siton main se 325 siten jeet gai
 Interestingly, things like the mobilization of Muslims or the unification of Muslims only indirectly benefits the BJP
 congress data cell ke pramukh praveen chakravarti ke ek adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki bhaajapa kaa vot share vastav main un jilon main zyada rahata he, jahaan musalamaanon kii aabaadi us rajya main musalamaanon kii aabaadi ke ausat se adhik (ausat se dedh guna yaa adhik) hai
 The difference in vote share is important enough to swing elections
 devband, jahaan kareeb 34 pratishat aabaadi muslim he, iskaa ek behatar udhaaharan he
 bjp's Hindu candidate Brijesh Singh won in 2017 with a vote share of 46 per cent, while SP and BSP Muslim candidates got 31 per cent and 24 per cent votes respectively
 bhaajapa netaaon ko lagata he ki muslim samarthan ke liye basapa kaa aakraamak abhiyaan antat unki party kii madad kar saktaa he
 BJP leader Shazia Ilmi says, "by appealing to Muslims to vote directly to their parties, the big opposition leaders are hurting the community
" isse bahusankhyak hindu matadaataaon ko yah lagata he ki dharmanirpekshata ke naam par alpsankhyakon kaa tushtikaran jari rahegaa
 Therefore, they will definitely vote for BJP
 "haalanki zyaadaatar musalamaanon ke liye bhaajapa pasand kii party nahin ho sakati phir bhi 2014 main prayek 10 voton main se ek vot muslim samudaay se tha
 The party hopes that its welfare schemes and social issues like triple talaq will support more Muslim women than before
 ilmi puuchhati hai, ''kya koi aisa kah saktaa he ki modi sarkaar kii kai kalyankari yojanaon kaa laabh musalamaanon tak nahin pahunch rahaa he?"bhartiya musalamaanon ke matdaan vyavhaar ko lekar kai myth hai
 As such, clerics have a strong influence on their choices and are more concerned about religious issues during voting
 is saal bhi vibhinn sampradaayon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hue lagbhag 700 ulema ne muslim matadaataaon se bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye ''dharmanirpeksh dalon" ko vot dene ko kaha he
 However, in the era of coalition politics, such politics lost its importance as it became difficult for Muslim leaders to understand the region-based Muslim electoral opinion
 vibhinn adhyayanon se yah bhi sanket miltaa he ki haalanki musalmaan dharm ke maamalon main ulema kii raay ko maanate hai lekin jab baat rajnatik faislon kii baat aati he to ve usamen ulema kaa dakhal anuchit maanate hai
 a 2015 CSDS study stated that 43 percent of Muslims feel that religious leaders should refrain from interfering in politics and should not talk of supporting a particular political party

 The debate on the triple talaq issue in Parliament also showed how 'secular political parties began to distance themselves from this to keep their positions politically strong
 ovaisi kehete hai ki congress ne apane muslim sadsy ko sansad main is vishay par bolne hi nahin diya
 "during the first debate in December 2017, only four of the 23 Muslim mps spoke on it," he says
 divangat moulana mohammad asaraarul haq qaasami, jo ki devband se farig vidwaan or akhil bhartiya milli parishad ke adhyaksh the, congress ke saansad the
 When i asked him why he did not participate in the debate, he said that the Congress did not allow him to do it

 Justice SC Sharma of the Indore bench of the High Court gave the verdict on August 10 after hearing a petition filed by Bhavya Jain, a student of Neemuch district

 halaat ye hai ki notification kaa virodh kar rahe chaatro ne jeenyu prashasan ko vidroh or virodh ke liye kisi bhi tareeke ko apnaane kii chunauti de daali he
 JNU will get Best University Award In fact, about 2 months ago, JNU students also pasted a poster on the information board which was put up by the JNU administration to warn students not to fast and perform at Freedom Square, in which JNU VC, Challenging the Registrar and Rector, he wrote that every method of rebellion and protest could be adopted by which JNU could be saved
 kareeb 30 ghante se zyada kaa vakt biit chukaa he lekin jeenyu ke chaatr admin block par date hue hai
 On Friday, JNU students did not give entry to anyone in the Admin block
 subah ke vakt register pramod kumaar admin block par pahunche lekin chaatro se baatcheet kii koshish naakaam rahi
 Amid debate and slogans, the JNU registrar had to return to the procession
 guuruuvaar ko afjal guru kii barsi, JNU main is baar kaarykram kii ijaajat nahinchatro kaa aarope he ki 5 may 2016 ke ujisi notification ko academic council kii baithak gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se paas kar diya gaya
 Due to which in 2017, the seats of M
 Phil and ph
d
 will be reduced
 chaatro kaa aarope he ki jeenyu prashasan ise jabardastee lagu kar rahaa he
 Angered by this notification, some students have been sitting on hunger strike for several days
 inhi main se ek chaatra shweta raaj kii apane anshan ke 11 din tabiyat bighad gai
 Shweta was taken to JNU Medical Center
 lekin iske baavjood chaatro ne jeenyu admin ke get par date rahane kaa faisla kiya
 jnu's MA Second Year student Dushyant Kumar said that this UGC notification will have an impact on his further studies
 darasal dushyant jeenyu ke soshal science vibhaag se hi richars karnaa chaahate hai lekin agar ujisi kaa 2016 kaa notification lagu ho jaataa he to phir richars ke liye siten kam ho jane se daakhila mushkil ho jayega
 Like Dushyant, Kriti is also unhappy with this notification
 kriti ke mutabik jeenyu ko visitors aword mila he or soshal sciensej main research ke liye jeenyu se behatar uniwarsity nahin he
 Why would anyone want to leave JNU? ujisi ko jeenyu main siten badhaani chahie na kii ghataani chahie
 Even if someone goes to other universities outside, it will be difficult for the students to pay their hefty fees
 jeenyu ke admin block ke har get kaa chaatro ne gheraav kar rakhaa tha
 While the students were seated with a curved and banner poster, the gate was blocked using the same pots that the JNU administration had used a few days earlier at the Freedom Square to block the students' protests
 jeenyu ke nilambit chaatro ne prophessoron ko skool main daakhil hone se rokader shaam jeenyu ke chaatro ko jeenyu shikshak sangh kaa bhi samarthan mila
 a big rally was organized on campus
 jeenyu chaatr sanghathan ke saath saath gheraabandi karne vaale chaatro main asi meeting main dakhal dene ke aarope ke chalate suspend kiye gaye chaatr bhi shaamil he
 The students have also decided to stay on the Admin block on Friday night
 JNU professor nivedita menon par rashtravirohi tippanee kaa aarope, jodhpur main maamla darjwahin duusari taraf jeenyu ke admin block kii gheraabandi kii vajah se do din se prashasnic kaam-kaaj puri tarah thapp he
 Dean of Students Rana P
 singh ne ek twit ke jariye kaha ki jeenyu chaatro kaa balpurvak admin block par kabja karnaa durbhagyapurna he
 Also, the Dean of Students issued a press release, in which he said that while appealing to the JNU students, the students representative came to discuss the matter at 9 am on Monday
 mumbai hamale ke baad se avaruddh shanti prakriya ko aage badhaate hue bharat or pakistan aatankwaadiyon or aatanki khataron ke bare main soochna saajha karne ke liye hotline shuru karne par sahamat ho gaye
 Pakistan has also allowed Indian investigative agencies to interrogate suspects of 26 / 11 terror attacks
 kendriya grih sachiv jike pillai or unke pakistani samakaksh choudhary qamar jamaa kii do divasiy baithak main donon deshon ke bich vishwaas bahaali sahit vibhinn muddon par charchaa hui
 The joint statement issued after the meeting said, "both countries have agreed to start a hotline between the Indian Home Secretary and the Pakistani Interior Secretary to exchange information at the right time in the context of terrorist threats
 " pakistan ne 2008 main hue mumbai hamale kii jaanch main bharat ke saath sahyog karne kii sahmati jataai he
 He has also agreed to allow the Indian team to interrogate the Mumbai attack suspects, who are under trial in Pakistan and are imprisoned there
 is rajamandi ke baad ab bharat kii rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) jackieur rahamaan lakhvi, abu al-kama or jaraar shah sahit lashkar-e-taiyaba ke saat sadasyon se poochtacha kar sakati he
 These terrorists had conspired for the Mumbai attack
 ek adhikari ne bataaya ki jaanch dal ke daure kii ruparekha or tareekhen baad main tay kii jaaengi
 The statement also said that the anti-terrorism investigative agencies of the two countries have decided to continue to cooperate in the investigation in relation to the Mumbai attack

 The exchange of prisoners between the two sides was also discussed
 bayaan ke anusaar, "is baat par sahmati jataai gai he ki donon paksh 15 april, 2011 ko un machuaaron or kaidiyon ko reeha kar denge, jinaki sajaa puri ho gai he or jinaki naagarikta kii pushti tathaa yatra sambandhi dastavej sambandhit desh se praapt ho gaye hon
 "apart from this, issues like the ongoing trial in Pakistan against Mumbai attack suspects, investigation of Samjhauta Express blast, liberalization of visa regulations, fake Indian currency smuggling and narcotics control were also discussed
 donon paksh saal main do baar grih sachiv str kii baatcheet yojit karne ko bhi sahamat hue hai
 Mukul Rayane, a former trusted aide of Mamata Banerjee, has turned to BJP by accusing her of being autocratic
 unke aaropon kaa khandan karte hue trinmul congress ke mahasachiv or shiksha mantriparth chatarji kaha ki raay ne party ke saath dhokhaa kiya he
 Romita Dattane spoke to both the leaders
 pesh hai sankshipt anshaikya hua? mamata ke saath aapke sambandh kyon kharaab hue?iske kai kaaran hai—vanshavaadi raajnneeti, sharada ghotaale ko ujagar karne ke liye sibiai ke saath sahyog karne kaa meraa faisla
 But the last reason was the party's decision to go with the Congress and the CPI (M)
 1997 main trinmul congress kaa gathan isliye kiya gaya tha, kyonki congress vam dalon ke saath sangharsh ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 If this was the reason for separation from the Congress, then what happened that we agreed to tie up with the Congress and our arch enemy CPI (M)
 yah party ke liye acha nahin tha
 Did you discuss this subject with Mamta? There is no scope for dialogue in Trinamool Congress
 vahaan ek hi shaks kii chalati he—ummidavaaron ke chayan se sansad main hamaare rukh tak
 Not a single occasion came when we could take a decision other than the party president (mamta)
 aap trinmul ko apane aap main sahi nahin hone ke liye chhod rahe hai, lekin bhaajapa main shaamil ho rahe hai?trinmul congress ke gathan ke kuch hi maheene baad mamata ne khud kaha tha ki bhaajapa ''achhut" nahin he
 The Trinamool Congress and BJP shared seats between 1998, 1999 and 2002 to 2006
 1999 kaa loksabhaa chunaav hamane rajg sahyogi ke rup main ladaa tha
 Mamta became Railway Minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government
 yahaan tak ki bangaroo lakshmana vaale maamle (2001) ke baad bhaajapa se naata todgaye ke baad kuch varshon ke liye ham phir rajg gathbandhan main laute
 i do not need to justify myself
 bina bhaajapa ke sahyog ke trinmul congress apni shandaar shuruyaat nahin kar paati
 They are calling you opportunistic, saying that you signed a deal with the BJP to avoid the CBI? The ED started an investigation into the Saradha scam in 2013 during the tenure of the UPA government and the Congress had demanded a CBI probe
 mujhe laga ki jaanch main sach kaa pataa laganaa chahie, kyonki isamen hajaaron garibon ke saath dhokhaa hua
 No matter which party i live in, i will cooperate in the investigation
 trinmul (netaaon) ne sochaa ki mujhe isamen fansaakar ve sharada ghotaale se apana haath dho sakate hai
 But i got away from it, but they could not
 sharada or naarad (ghotaale) main ahm abhiyukt hone par bhi bhaajapa aapako shaamil karne ko kaise taiyaar ho gai?maine apni begunaahi sabit kar di
 The CBI called me only once on 30 January 2015
 agency ke paas meraa peechha karne ke liye koi kaaran nahin tha
 i can see a two per cent jump in BJP votes, due to which the Trinamool Congress will lose many seats in 2019
 bhaajapa loksabhaa main 12 siten jeet sakati he
 Things are changing at the ground level
 matadaataaon ko aap kaise samajhaayenge, vishesh rup se alpsankhyak samudaay ko, jo hameshaa aapako ek dharmanirpeksh netaa ke rup main jaanate rahe hai?alpsankhyakon kaa ek bada tabaka naaraaz he
 The government claims that it has done a lot for Muslims, but nothing is visible
 musalamaanon ke bich teevr dhruvikaran he, jo labhanvit hue hai or jo laabh paane se vanchit rah gaye hai unke bich
 For the first time, there will be polarization in the election of Bengal and the BJP will increase its vote share by ensuring this
 294 vidhansabha kshetron main se 136 main alpsankhyak prabhavi nahin hai
 Where they are effective, they are divided because of dissatisfaction
 main bhavishyavaanee karata hum ki trinmul congress ke alpsankhyak voton main chaar fisadi kii giravat aegi
 But the brand Mamata is still respected among the vast majority? Indira Gandhi was also the brand in 1977
 aisi branding kaa raajnneeti main koi mahatv nahin hota
 In 2016, the margin of Trinamool Congress winning 100 seats was only 5,000-15,000 votes and BJP got 15,000-20,000 votes
 agar ve vot congress or vam gathbandhan ke paas chale gaye, to kahani kuch alag hogi
 You believe that there is dynastic politics in Trinamool Congress, are you hinting about Mamata's nephew? i once again say that the people who have made great movements of Trinamool Congress (nanur, Satchpur, Singur, Nandigram, Netai) They did not have any experience, competence or credibility for leadership
 afsos ki khun pani se adhik motaa hota he
 But dynasty does not make anyone a leader
 18 saal baad bhi rahul gandhi ko taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Is there any possibility of aligning with Mamata? ham aise bindu par pahunch gaye hai, jahaan se lautaa nahin ja saktaa
 They have engaged their administration to keep an eye on me
 meraa phone tepe kiya ja rahaa he
 Politics has intensified regarding the National Register of Citizens (NRC)
 trinmul congress ne enarasi droft ke khilaaf loksabhaa main sthagan prastaav kaa notice thamaya he, to bijepi ke netaa subramanyam swami kaa kahana he ki jo bhartiya naagarik nahin hai unhen baahar bhej diya janaa chahie
 Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Manoj Jha, released on NRC, said that the people who have been there for the last 5 decades are the proof of that and now they are no longer citizens of this country
 sarkaar ko samvedansheel hona chahie, yah sab kuch raajnneetik phaayde ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 On this episode, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said, 'those who are not Indians should be sent out, we are not a hospice
 'maamle par grih mantri rajnath singh ne kaha ki aaj joenarasi listjari kii gai he wo sirf masauda he antim list nahin he
 Everyone has the right to complain or object under the law against it
 har kisi kii shankaa kaa samaadhaan kiya janaa chahie
 Assam Congress President and Rajya Sabha MP Ripun Bora says that the BJP is trying to polarize the religious level
 badi sankhya main muslim, nepali gorkha or yahaan tak kii hinduon ko isse asar padegaa
 On the other hand, Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant said that those who are not named in the NRC list should be excluded from India
 iske liye chunaav ayog bhi doshi he
 Bangladeshis should be excluded
 sarkaar ke liye yah aankh kholane vaali sthiti he
 a similar survey should also be conducted in Maharashtra and other parts of the country
 enarasi report parkendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne kaha ki kisi bhi bhartiya nagarki par iskaa asar nahin padana chahie
 We thank the initiative of the Government of Assam which took such a step for the first time in the country
 ghuspaithiye ke liye sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko ekajute hokar samarthan karnaa chahie
 Which country in the world will not be a voice against intruders? congress iske liye jimmedaar he jisane vot ke laalach main paap kiya
 On this, Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju said that this report should not be politicized
 yah sab kuch supreme court kii nigaraanee main kiya ja rahaa he
 This is not the final list
 Those who have been left out will get a chance to speak
 isse pehle somvaar subah 10 baje neshnaregister of citijan (enarasi)kii duusari list jari kii gai or is nai list main 40 lakh se zyada logon ko avaidh naagarik maan liya gaya he
 However, they have a chance to include AAP name in the list and gain citizenship
 enarasi par jari draft ke anusaar 2 karod 89 lakh 83 hajaar 677 logon ko vaid naagarik maan liya gaya he
 3,29,91,384 people applied for valid citizenship, out of which 40,07,707 were considered illegal

 These 5 reasons can be seen in Saif and Nawaz's 'sacred Games'
 Saif is seen in the web series Sacred Games as an honest police officer named Sartaj Singh
 sikh luk main saf ek baar phir darshakon ko anterten kar rahe hai
 Earlier, this avatar of Saif was seen in the film Love Nowadays
 secred games 8 episod main bani ek gangster or uske ird-gird ghoomane vaale kirdaaron kii dilachasp kahani he
 Its story was adapted from Vikram Chandra's best-selling novel, but with many changes
 kya he secred games kii kahani:isi siries kii kahani sartaaj singh yani saf ke aasapaas gumti he
 He is an officer of the Mumbai Police, who fights against gangster Ganesh Gaitonde
 ganesh khud ko god samajhataa he
 It is interesting to see how this officer fights a famous criminal
 indinon web plateform par jari ho raheen syrius, antertenment kaa ek nayaa medium banakar ubhari hai
 This new way of entertainment, from films to the world of television is also seen giving a tremendous competition
 darshakon kii ruchi web plateform par din pratidin badhati ja rahi he
 Perhaps that's why Sacred Games, Lust Stories and many web series are in the news
 is baat main koi do raay nahin ki darshak saf ke sikh police officer ke kirdaar ko pasand kar rahe hai
 Saif's character is not being liked more for honesty but for the confused life of this police officer
 ek aisa officer jo neend kii goliyaan dinabhar chviingam kii tarah chabaata najar aata he
 Saif Ali Khan's name, Agent arrestsacred Games in wild pig hunting case is getting hit, so Saif's move to work in web series can give a new direction to his damadole career

 The economic growth rate has been downhill for the last five quarters, with the core sector and industrial production showing signs of further deterioration, corporate tax relief may have boosted companies' profits, but consumption worsens, all from car to biscuits Companies are harassing companies, credit growth is negative even after loans are cheaper and there is no hope of increasing private investment
 is ghor nakaaratmak aarthik maahaul ke baad bhi share bazaar oonchai par he
 In today's economic talk, on the IPO market
 haal main aeindian railway cataring and tourism corporation(iarsitisi) keipio ne niveshkon ko maalamaal kar diya
 Listed at a premium of more than 100 per cent, this stock gave three times the money in three months
 aise samay main jab companiyaan bazaar main ipio laane kii himmat nahin juta paa raheen, tab ek sarkari company ke ipio kii yah safalataa kai ishaare karti he
 The success of irctc's IPO after Demart suggests that companies with good cash inflow are still the first choice of investors
 ·beete ek dashak main arthvyavastha kii surat kai myanon main badal gai, lekin nivesh ke liye ve companiyaan nahin mil raheen jinakon ham apni jindagi kaa sabase zyada istemaal kar rahe
 In the US market, Facebook, Twitter, Google were making huge profits because the market came to the market to raise capital at the right time and investors also changed the investment companies in the changing scenario of the economy
 lekin bharat ke bazaar main aisa nahin he
 We see Ola - Uber as a revolutionary change in the auto industry, but there are still old auto companies in the market for investment
 isi tarah gold ko pachhadkar electronic vasteen (mobile) desh main duusari sabase zyada aayaat hone vaali cheez ho gai, lekin nivesh ke liye bazaar main koi mobile company uplabdh nahin he
 whatsapp and other social media platforms, which interfere in the country from politics to economy, are far from the reach of Indians
 aise udhaaharan or bhi hai
 · 37 ipos approved in SEBI
 kuch companiyaan bazaar main samay rahete dastak nahin de pain
 About 30 ipos worth 30 thousand crores are ready to come in the market
 lekin sabko aisa hi rispons mili yah jaruri nahin iske liye demart or iarsitisi jaise bijness model or cash flo hona jaruri hai
 The market regulator also needs to pay attention to the direction that companies that hold a large market share or revolutionize the market with the help of new technology, should be encouraged to raise money from the market
 ek starop agar majboot bijness model ke dam par funding laa saktaa he to kyon nahin niveshak apni puunji usamen nivesh kar sakate hai
 It can be argued that small investors will be at great risk to their capital

 Chaudhary Baba Harkishan Malik of 52 villages of Ghatwala Khap is smoking hookah on his porch in Lisadh village of Shamli district
 unke saath unke 60 varshiya bete rajendra malik or kuch gaanv vaale 27 march ke akhbaar main chape supreme court ke faisle par itmeenaan se charchaa kar rahe hai
 In this decision, the Uttar Pradesh government has been reprimanded for not being able to trace the plot of Muzaffarnagar riots beforehand and also said how the Samajwadi Party government has failed to apprehend the accused
 par bel ke ped ke neeche chal rahi yah hukka baithak asal main adaalat ke faisle kaa saraasar majaak-sa udaati dikhti he kyonki 84 saal ke harkishan malik par bheed ko uksaane or hatya sahit dangon ke 26 maamle darj hai
 At the same time, Rajendra has three dozen cases related to riots including murder
 kolhu se uth rahi taaja gud kii mahak se madmaati hawa main badi vinamrata se rajendra ne khud yah baat bataai
 Taking out the list of cases from his pocket, Rajendra Malik says, "now you tell me, how can Baba commit a crime like murder when it does not go away?" Yes, picking the voter list and litigating it from one side
 yahaan to kuch bhi na hua
 "it is clear from the conversation how confident they are about not having their arrest
" vaise, unki maasoom daleelon ke baavjood is gambhir aarope ko darkinar nahin kar sakate ki lisadha ke inter college main dangon se pehle hui panchayat ke choudhary to baba hi the, bhale hi unki umr kitni bhi zyada kyon na ho
 And his eye gesture still matters in Khap
 duusari baat yah ki jise ve 'yahaan to kuch na hua' kah rahe hai, use hi police record main 13 hatyaon ke rup main darj kiya gaya he
 But the other aspect of the police's promptness is that it has not been able to fix the five-km road on the road connecting Baba's house to Phugana police station in seven months
 giraftaar main police kii dhilaai kaa haal yah he ki dangon main bhi namjad 804 log aaj bhi kaagajon main faraar hai, jabaki ve baba kii tarah hi aaraam se apane ghar par baithe hai
 Yes, this attitude of the police has increased the panic of the Muslims who have escaped from the village
 unke bade-bade makaan bhutaha ho gaye hai
 Items are scattered in them and windows and doors are uprooted
 inamen se kuch makaanon main gaanv vaale ab apni gaay-bhens baandh rahe hai
 The condition of Lisadh is the same as that of Majra Hasanpur of this panchayat
 hasanpur ke 30 varshiya taiyab jab hamen muslimbahul jola gaanv ke camp main mili to unki ankhen dabdba ain
 "I used to go to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to sell clothes," said the father of four children who worked as hawkers with money from Jats on interest
 akasar shaharon main jhuggiyaan bhi dikhti thim
 But never in my dream did i think that one day we too will be forced to live in slums
 '' taiyab maanate hai ki unke gaanv main kisi musalmaan kii hatya nahin hui, lekin lisadha ne un jaison ko buree tarah khaufjada kar diya he
 They do not want to go to the village anymore, the government has not even given compensation to this village
 aise main ve log bhi baaki logon kii tarah muaavje kii baat joh rahe hai, taaki jindagi ko nae sire se shuru karne kaa kuch aadhaar mili
 Anyway, the shadow of fear is now forcing a new home
 yahi khauf ab pashchimi upi ke danga peedit gaanvon kii sthaayee pahchaan ban gaya he
 The social fabric here is completely shattered
 jat bahul gaanv ab sirf hindu gaanv rah gaye hai, kyonki musalamaanon ne inhen hameshaa ke liye tauba kah diya he
 Fugana, Etawah, Nala, Kharar, Ellam, Hasanpur, Bawdi, Harali, Nirpura, whatever village you mention, a picture of the exodus of Muslims will be seen
 haa, shahpur se sata basii gaanv iskaa apwaad dikhaai degaa
 This is the only village in Muzaffarnagar where Hindus of Valmiki community have migrated from the village for fear of Muslims
 darasal yahi vah gaanv he jahaan mujffarnagar se panchayat kar laut rahe jaaton par 7 sitambar ko musalamaanon ne patharav kiya tha or ek jat kii maut ho gai thi
 After that the Dalits did not find it safe to live in this Muslim-majority village
 gaanv ke 28 valmiki parivaar tab se mujffarnagar ke gandhinagar muhalle main rah rahe hai
 Babita Valmiki, who is living here with her four children, says, "we have brought the children here somehow after crossing the chest filled to the chest
 vahaan bahut khatra he
 "his son Aman, who studied in the sixth standard, has also missed school
" or yahaan ve jis jhuggi main rah rahi hai, us par bhi raat-din ujaade jane kaa khatra he
 Ravi Valmiki of the village is agitated by the situation, "muslims have got compensation but we have not received even a single penny
 kya hindu hona jurm he? ''lekin na to koi taiyab ke sawaal kaa jawaab de rahaa he or na ravi ke sawaal kaa, kyonki jo netaa satta main hai, ve saat maah main unki koi thos madad kar nahin paae or jo vipaksh main hai, ve is guntaade main lage hai ki dangon se unhen napha hoga yaa nuksaan
 That is why there may not have been any initiative to make the houses of riot victims livable, but it is not too late to give them new voter cards to keep them voters
 jola or loi ke campon main rah rahe musalamaanon ke naam sharnaarthi shiviron ke pate ke saath matadaata soochiyon main darj kar liye gaye hai or jald hi ve inhen ilaakon ke voter ho jaaenge, bhale hi ve kisi gaanv ke rahane vaale hon
 The voter list is also being prepared there, where people have somehow got home
 aisi hi nai basti basii he sarai gaanv ke paas shekhulhind naam se
 Here Jamiat ulema-e-hind has built 55 houses for Muslims
 jola camp ke shajid ne bataaya, ''gaanv ke saamne sipiem bhi ham logon ke liye makaan ban rahi he
 "it is not that political parties are only worried about the voter list
 unhen voter ko apane paale main khinchne kii bhi utani hi chintaa he
 That is why only the SP flags of the Akhilesh Yadav government, which took the initiative to forcibly destroy the Loi camp in November, are now seen waving on this camp
 sapa ko ummid bandha rahi he ki dangon ke baad bispi kaa muslim-dalit sameekaran tut gaya he
 In such a situation, Kadir Rana of BSP may face difficulty in becoming MP again
 udhar danga peedit gaanvon main 'ab kii baar, modi sarkaar' ke chote-chote bannron ke saath bijepi bhi apni maujuudagi dikhaane main lagi he
 Although the entire area was covered with grand banners of Narendra Modi before the election code of conduct came into force, but due to the compulsion of the code, the party has to be satisfied with small banners
 phir bhi bijepi dangon kii aanch main paki dhruvikaran kii daavat kaa majaa lene se chuknaa nahin chaahati
 The party has given tickets to riots accused Sanjeev Balyan from Muzaffarnagar and Hukum Singh from Kairana
 saaf he ki ye nae sameekaran jat varchasv vaale ajit singh ke rashtriya lokdal ke liye bhi chunauti pesh kar rahe hai
 In this new environment, the politics of the profession has become such a puzzle, in which the government does not understand that there is an advantage in hardening the accused or in forgetting to put the case in cold storage
 isiilie danga peedit maare-maare phir rahe hai, mukhya aaropee aaraam se choudharahat kar rahe hai or sarkaar adaalat main fatkaar kha rahi he
 The plea of ashok Todi, the main accused in the suicide case of Rizwan Ur Rehman of Kolkata, will be heard in the Supreme Court today

 iske baad court ne inhen baarah disambar ko pesh hone kaa aadesh diya

 com / u4ogqvhjbi — Kajol (@kajolatun) May 1, 2017 das-das saal jamaa bees saal pehle hi kaid ho chuki thi
 But now the count of years has no meaning
 kyonki yahaan to baba kii puri umr hi kaid kar di gai he
 That is, as long as there is life, it is behind bars
 gurmeet ram rahim or uske teen gurgon ko patrkaar ramchandra prajapati ke katl ke ilzaam main panchkula kii sibiai court ne umr kaid kii sazaa suna di he
 The special thing is that Ram Rahim was also given the news of this sentence in the same jail in which he is serving 20 years imprisonment since 2017 under the first installment under the name of prisoner number 1997
 zindgibhar jail main rahenge baba2009 main baba ram rahim kaise the
 How did it happen in 2019? or 2029 main to naa jane kaise honge
 Because now it has been decided that Baba, who was already serving 20 years in jail for the rape of sadhvis, will be here for a long time
 kyonki ramchandra chhatrapati murder cese main adaalat kaa faisalaa aa gaya
 Baba has been given life sentence for killing a journalist
 ab zindagi bhar baba gurmeet ram rahim jail main rahenge
 Now death will only get freedom from jail
 When Baba went to jail in 2017, Baba was sharp in the eyes
 chehre par rubaab the
 The hair was black and the legs were young
 magar ab jail se khabar mil rahi he ki baba kii ankhon main maayusi he
 There are wrinkles on the face
 dadhi or bal safed or chaal jhuki hui he
 According to sources, it is also difficult to identify Baba now
 adaalat ne unhen patrkaar ramchandra chhatrapati murder cese main jo umraqaid kii sazaa di he, wo unhen un 20 saalon ke alaava kaatani he jo baba ko sadhviyon ke saath balaatkaar ke maamle main mili he
 That means Baba will remain in jail till death
 baba kii abhi kai or karatuuton kaa hisaab hona abhi baaki he
 Overall, Baba now believes that jail is his permanent address
 guruuvar kii dopaher baba ram rahim ko ye khushkhabari panchkula main sibiai kii ek vishesh adaalat ne video conference ke jariye di
 In the case of the murder of journalist Ramchandra Chhatrapati, the CBI lawyer had demanded the execution
 magar adaalat ne baba ko kul 14 saal sazaa-e-bamushkkat de di
 Let us tell you that on 24 October 2002, two shooters on a bike in broad daylight shot five shots at Chhatrapati
 jiske baad 21 november 2002 ko dilli ke apollo aspataal main ramchandra chhatrapati kii maut ho gai thi
 The court sentenced Baba Ram Rahim to life imprisonment and three of his associates have also been sentenced to life imprisonment
 aapako bataa den ki chhatrapati kii maut ke baad saal 2003 main sirsa police ne hatya kaa maamla darj kiya tha
 But due to Ram Rahim's high reach, nothing further happened in the case
 baad main balaatkaar ke maamle ke maamle ke saath-saath 2006 main patrkaar ramchandra chhatrapati murder cese ko bhi adaalat ke aadesh par haryana police se lekar sibiai ko saunp diya gaya
 After the initial investigation, in 2007, the CBI filed a charge sheet in this case, making Ram Rahim and his three people Kuldeep Singh, Nirmal Singh and Krishna Lal accused
 isamen ram rahim ko is hatyakand kaa mukhya aaropee bataaya gaya tha
 a total of 46 witnesses were produced in this case
 magar ram rahim ko gunahagaar tehraane main jisaki gavaahi sabase zyada ahm sabit hui wo koi or nahin balki ram rahim kaa apana purv driver khatta singh tha
 Khata Singh testified in the court that Gurmeet Ram Rahim had ordered the killing of journalist Ramchandra Chhatrapati in front of him

 Rahul's remarks come after a statement by Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh, in which he advocated Rahul Gandhi for the top post, saying that the existing system of separate party president and Prime Minister did not work
 congress ne haalanki digvijay singh ke vichaaron ko khaarij kar diya or kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh or party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bich talmail ek adarsh model he, jo bhavishya main bhi jari rah saktaa he

 There is a 3 percent chance that he can become Prime Minister

 is baar chhuttiyon main himachal jane kaa program bana
 i believe in traveling by train, so i traveled from Delhi to Kalka with Shatabdi, then i had to go further by train, that too by toy train
 toy train isliye ki ek hasarat thi ki isamen bhi safar kiya jaae or beti to khaasaa utsahit thi
 Toy trains run on narrow gauge
 4 se 5 dibbe hote hai, yah kaaphi dhimi gati se chalati he or har 2-3 minute par ek surang se guzarati he
 People especially children scream in great enthusiasm at that time
 kalka se shimla pahunchane main is train ko 6 ghante lagate hai
 The train we went to was an ordinary train but it also has a couch train
 aap chahen to puraa dibba bhi book kara sakate hai
 Some trains also have a pantry car in which you can get food of your choice
 sabaki alag-alag timming he, aap apni suvidha ke anusaar train chun sakate hai
 This train has been included in the international heritage
 train main baitha main soch rahaa tha ki angrejon ne kaise yah trek bichaaya hoga
 If we are able to take care of it, then we can also let our upcoming generations also board this train and enjoy the exciting journey
 train main titi babu ne bataaya ki unki ek pareshaani main rail bhawan main adhikariyon tak pahunchaa duun
 TT Babu said that there are 5 coaches in this train which are not connected, due to which TT has difficulty in checking the ticket
 unhen har stesan par utar kar ek dabbe main janaa padataa he or puri train check karne main gaadi shimla tak pahunch jaati he or iskaa phayda uthaa kar log stesan par utar kar duusare dibbe main chadh jate hai
 Well after an exciting journey of 3 hours we reached Kandaghat from where Chail is near
 magar kanda ghat se sadhupul pahunchane par pataa chalaa ki pul tut chukaa he
 Actually, on this 100-year-old bridge, three trucks wandered the path filled with apples and reached Sadhupul
 teenon trek pul par chadh gaye
 The old bridge could not bear the weight of three trucks and sat down full
 ab ek diavarjan ke jariye nadi paar kerani thi
 After a sharp landing which was quite dangerous, we were in front of the Ashwin River
 nadi main zyada pani nahin tha keval takhnon ke thodaa upar tak hoga isliye nadi paar karnaa aasaan tha
 Now this is the way to go to Chail, that is why it has become a tourist point
 yahaan nadi main hi kursi teble laga rahata he, aap nadi ke bich baithe paanv pani main or chaay pakaadon, megi jaisi chizon kaa anand uthaa sakate hai
 i stayed at a resort 7 kilometers before Chail
 sadak ke kinare hi yah jagah he magar pul tuutane ke kaaran trephic na ke baraabar he
 It is a very quiet place, there are big mirrors in the room, lift the curtains, can see the mountains, forest and cloud lying on the bed
 ham jis vakt vahaan the, roj barish hoti rahi, mausam main thandhak, raat main kamare main aag jalaai jaati thi
 After facing the rush and traffic of Delhi, this place seemed to be nothing less than paradise
 chail choti si jagah he, driver ne bataaya ki yahaan atm bhi 6 maheene pehle hi khulaa he
 At the behest of the driver, we went to eat food at Sonu's Dhaba, it was also in the heart that the setting is done by the drivers' dhabas, but when we reached there, we saw that this dhaba is handled only by women and it is available only with grilled bread
 khaane kaa kya kahana daal makhni, curry or paneer kaa swaad maasha allaah
 When i went to pay the money and told the lady to take the driver's bill as well, she said that the driver has paid himself
 phir mujhe jhatka laga or yaad aayaa ki ham himachal main hai or yahaan eemaandaaree bachi he
 Also visited Shimla for a day, it takes 2 to two and a half hours from Chail
 shimla tak sadak chakachak he or trephic bhi khub he or shimla se 10 kilometre pehle se hi jam lagane lagata he
 When somehow reached the mall by lift, Lajpat has come to Nagar or Karol Bagh
 mal par duniya ke har bade brands ke store aapako mil jaaenge
 We reached the coffee house to have food which was packed
 dosa khaaya, coffee pi or waapas chail ke liye nikal pade
 At the resort met her owner
 main yah jaananaa chahta tha ki yahaan dhandha karne kaa unka anubhav kaisaa he
 He told that this is a very quiet place, till date he has not paid a money bribe to the police or any other officer
 log eemaandaar hai
 When the guest mobile in the hotel is often forgotten, the staff submits it at the reception
 unka kahana tha ki dheron mobile hamane logon ko vaapis kiya he
 Finally i would like to mention one more incident
 ham jab waapas kalka aae to usee driver ko bulaayaa jo hamen chail or shimla ghuma rahaa tha
 Kalka is 62 kilometers from Chail, it takes two and a half hours because no one wants to miss Gyanji's dhaba in Solan
 jab ham kalka pahunche to driver ko poocha kitne paise usne bolaa 2000 rupee
 i thought maybe taking less money because he has to go back 60 km
 main use kuch or paise pakadaane laga to usne haath jod liya
 i was wondering what kind of a man is but after some stubbornness he took the money but left us with the luggage till the station
 saath hi chod1 gaya hamaare puure parivaar ke liye ek aisa ahsaas jisaki ummid aap chail jaise choti jagah ke logon se hi kar sakate hai vahiin

 Salman has campaigned for many products
 saath hi vah kai companiyon ke brands ambassador bhi hai
 He said, 'when i promote a product, it means that you wear it, use it or eat it

 ’ The death of Australian cricketer Phil Hughes is indeed painful and also tragic
 isse pehle bharat ke raman lamba bhi cricket match ke dauraan chotil hone ke baad apane chaahane waalon ko alavida kah gaye the
 But cricketers of street street in India are exposed to such dangers every day
 beshak huge or lamba international khilaadi the or unke paas har vah sajo-saamaan tha, jisase ve khud ko surakshit rakh sakate the
 But he did not have luck, so that he could save himself
 lekin jaraa bharat ke un gali-mohallo ke cricketron ke bare main sochie jo roj is tarah ke jokhim se do-chaar hote hai
 Those who have neither proper goods, nor things that protect the body
 lekin yah junun or lack (jab tak kaam kare) hi hota he jo khilne or choton se mukaable main rakhata he
 So was our era (1990s), the craze of cricket
 har sande ko match hota or proper kit kii jagah hota to sirf junun
 First of all in the morning looking for a plain
 uske baad vahaan khilne ke liye virdohi tiimon ke saath muqabla karnaa or aakhir main ek samjhaute ke tahat pahunchane par aadhe-aadhe din ke liye maidan milanaa
 There was no concept of pocket money
 laal kile ke peeche se kharide gaye pad, bat or glavj hote or el-guard bhi
 There was also an old helmet which would often come in front of the eyes when shot
 bas, inhen ke sahare kai toornament khele
 Scored many half-centuries but was always in danger
 taang par gend lage to hafte bhar tak dard nahin jaataa tha
 When a friend sacrificed his two teeth on cricket because of an inadequate helmet, one day despite the L-guard, the ball hit the ground for 10 minutes
 yahaan tak to thik lekin jis din ground nahin miltaa or cricket kaa junun hiloren bharta to lat hamen dilli ke mori get ke cricket maidan yaa india get le jaati jahaan ham khelnaa bahut kam pasand karte the
 The reason is that there are so many people playing together that they do not understand which ball belongs to whom and when and from where, which ball will heat your temple
 kai maukey to aise aae ki kisi duusare kii gend ke peeche bhaagane lage to kabhi kisi duusare kii gend ne qamar garm kar di
 Even today such threats exist
 kul milakar kah sakate hai ki ham cricket ke jununee hai or shaayad ham aise jokhim bhare andaaj main cricket khelte hai jisamen kabhi bhi kuch bhi hone kaa saaya hamaare sir par mandaraata rahata he
 Salute to the Indian cricketers of the street who have reached beyond the risk and will say that no one like Phil and Raman should be with anyone

’ geet se rashtriya-antarrashtriya str par pahchaan paane valinuttarakhandki mashhoor lokgayikacbutari devika haal hi main nidhan hua
 The shame for me is that i was able to get many important information about him shortly before his death and now i am writing on him as well
 kabutari ke is geet ko duniya bhar main faile uttarakhand ke pravaasiyon ke alaava nepal main bhi khub pyaar mila
 Some words in this song have also come from Nepal and in this sense this song is also a symbol of the shared culture of India and Nepal in the old times
 iske alaava, is geet main hamen donon deshon ko baantne vaali mahakali nadi or duusare prakritik bimb or vahaan kii saamaajik sthitiyon kaa rupan bhi dekhne ko miltaa he
 Kabutari has introduced Uttarakhand's natural scenes in his folklore, but we will try to see in this article series how the vivid questions of the then socio-economic conditions come up in his singing and he can take the status quo from his singing
 How many tries to break? Apart from this, it is also a question of what is the nature of folk songs and folk arts left in Uttarakhand after the demise of Kabutari and he is ready to move with time in the face of the challenges of globalization or making his identity
 
 lekh kaa pehla hissaa unke jivan sangharsh or rachanaatmak safar ke bare main he
 The stone struggle of the hawkariya (dalit) caste of Uttarakhand, who broke the stone with the help of hands, was as difficult as the common women of Uttarakhand, but it was annoying to that level due to being born in a closed society and craftsman (dalit) caste That it would be very difficult for most to realize this
 kabutari jin haathon se saaj bajaati thim, unheen haathon se pathar bhi todatii thim
 Hrudakya (ie, Hukka, a hand-held instrument, a caste played by a neck slightly larger than Damru) was also used as a form of abuse in Uttarakhand at one time because the upper castes used to look at singing and dancing in a hazy manner used to go
 yah savarna tabake kaa doharaa ravaiya hi kaha jayega ki yah tabaqa lokkalaon or lokkalakaaron ko alag-alag nazariye se dekhtaa rahaa
 The traditional means of livelihood of the Dalits of Uttarakhand are agricultural labor, stone-breaking, building construction, agricultural machinery and tools, and festival festivals (palo Maina on a rainy day
 
 
 
 ), Dancing and singing at weddings and other festivals
 kabutari ne bhi apane mata-pita or nani se saat saal kii umr se hi gayan sikh liya tha
 At an early age she was married to Deewani Ram, who wrote songs for her and sang to her on various forums
 vahi unhen akashwani tak bhi le gaye
 Akashwani gave the identity song Akashwani sung in various language programs in Najibabad, Rampur, Lucknow and Mumbai in the 1970s and 80s
 lakhanu doordarshan centre se bhi unke gayan kaa prasaaran hua
 More than a dozen of his recordings are with All India Radio
 iske alaava unhone kshetreey tyoharon, ramlilaon, uttarayani parvon jaise kai manchon par bhi gayan kiya, jise shaayad hi sangrakshit kiya gaya ho
 After the death of her husband, she made a distance from social life and she started living in her house in Pithoragarh, the frontier district of Uttarakhand and started working as a family to raise her family
 2002 main pithauragarh ke chaliya mahotsav main navoday parvatiy kala manch unhen phir se logon ke saamne laayaa or 2004 main unhen uttara patrika kii sampadika dow
 The efforts of Uma Bhatt, Yugamancha, Pahar and Nainital were re-launched in Nainital
 yahaan se kabutari kaa doosraa daur shuru hua
 Sanskriticist and playwright Zahoor Alam says that this successful program also got a lot of coverage from the media and after that he was called to sing from all over the country
 dow
 With the efforts of Uma Bhatt, Zahoor Alam, Sanjay Joshi, Sanjay Mattoo, a documentary on Kabutari Devi has also been prepared
 ise kabutari devi ke saamne hi locarpit karnaa tha ki unka asamay nidhan ho gaya
 It will now be launched in Nainital on 16 September
 begum akhtar, tijanbai or kabutaribuland aawaaj kii malikaa kabutari devi ne sangeet kii aupchaarik diksha nahin lee
 Zahoor Alam states that she used to sing songs, ghazals and thumri in her style along with Riturayan (song of the season), Chauti, Nyoli, Chapeli, Dhuska
 unhen uttarakhand kii tijanbai yaa pahaad kii begum akhtar bhi kaha jaataa he
 Folk Culture of Uttarakhand, Dr
 who studied folk arts
 girija pandey ke mutabik kabutari ne apane shrotaaon ke liye kai baar begum akhtar ko bhi gaaya he
 Both Begum Akhtar and Kabootari are known as high-necked singers
 samskruthikarmi or naatakkaar jahur alam kehete hai ki kabutari devi kii buland aawaaj or khanakdaar gale ke saath hi unki kharajadaar aawaaj ek had tak begum akhtar kii gayikee kii yaad dilaati thi
 However, Uttarakhand's color workers and culture fellows do not agree with this comparison
 isaki ek vajah to yah ho sakati he ki tijan ne pandavavani (mahabharat kii katha) gaai he, jabaki kabutari ke gayan main adhikansh prakruti, virah (nioli) or prem ke geet hai or divine geet yadakada hi aae hai
 Fellow of Culture and Media, Dr
 bhupen singh kehete hai ki jis tarah tijan bai ko chhattisgarh kii kabutari devi nahin kaha ja saktaa, usee tarah kabutari ko uttarakhand kii tijanbai kahana sahi nahin he, media ko aisi tulanaaon se bachanaa chahie
 He says that the surroundings, social conditions and terrain of the two singers are different, so they should be viewed with these references
 haa, uttarakhand ke ubharate rangakarmi or sahityakar anil karki kabutari ko prachlit manyataon ko todane ke sandarbh main begum akhtar kehane ke hami hai, haalanki baad main ghazal gayikee ke shastreey gayan ke dhaanche main aane se unhen begum akhtar kaha janaa bhi anil ko sahi nahin lagata
 This comparison is called simplification
 anil kehete hai ki tijan or begum ne lok ko shaastra main dhaalane kii koshish kii, jo ki kabutari ke gayan main nahin miltaa
 He explains, Kumaoni music was also academic by singing in the Akashvani of Kabootari and it was tied to the free folk within 5-6 minutes
 kabutari ke gayan main pahaad kii jhalkarashtrapati puraskaar se sammanit kabutari ne gayan ko apana purnakalik pesha nahin banaaya, shaayad isliye unhen itnaa naam nahin mila
 Dr
 anil karki bataate hai ki unase ek baar kabutari devi ke gayan dal ke hi varisht sadsy or unhen sikhaane vaale (dalit) lokagayak bhanuram suakoti ne kaha tha ki vah casette bechney ke liye nahin gaate hai
 It is understandable that singing of Kabootari was also beyond the desire to earn fame and fame from the market
 anil bataate hai ki kabutari bina tamzam, manchi aadambar ke kahin bhi, kabhi bhi gane ko taiyaar rahati thim
 The pigeon sang with harmonium and hudke
 vah apane pati ke saath kaaryakramon main hissaa lene jaati thim
 The roads did not reach the mountains then and used to go on foot
 isi dauraan vah raste main pati divaani ram ke rache geeton ko yadakar gayikee kaa abhyaas (riyaj) karti thim
 His songs include exodus, viraha, mausam, chidiya, pahar, nau-naul, jungle, bull-buffalo, night-day, moon-stars, grasslands and temples
 kabutari devi ke gayan main jis anupaat main uttarakhand kii prakritik khubsuurati aati he, us anupaat main vahaan kii saamaajik vidrupata adrishy he
 This is when the pigeons come from the marginalized sections of the society and reach a point where people of all classes are eager to listen to them
 unke paas aisa mauka tha ki vah ek band samaaj kii chetana ko jhinzod sakati thim
 At present, this aspect of his singing has not been talked about
 hamaari koshish rahegi ki ham agle do hisson main is par baat karenge
 Potential last interview of Kabutari Devi (this is the first part of a series of three articles on Kabutari Devi
 islekh ke duusare hissemen hamane yah jaanane kii koshish kii he ki pahaad kii aawaaj banakar ubharin kabutari ke gayan ne unke samaaj kii paristhitiyon ko badalane kii kis had tak koshish kii
 It can be said that this is an additional request from an artist, but the responsibility of responsible art is not just to depict society, nature and circumstances, but also to try to change it in favor of the people

 Without naming the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in the country, he told the Congress that one of his leaders had taken the issue of Jammu and Kashmir to the international stage
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki congress ne jammu kashmir main loktantr ke saath jitna khilwaad kiya he, utana kisi ne nahin kiya
 He said that there is no need to tell anyone how the elections of 1957, 1962 and 1967 were held in the state

 This paragraph needs to be defined in a manner
 trinmul congress ke derek o bryan ne kaha ki jammu kashmir ke mudde par charchaa hone ke samay ladakh kaa bhi zikr kiya janaa chahie
 He told the government that Jammu and Kashmir is the paradise of the country, don't make hell out of it

 congress saansad aaazaad ne rajnath singh se poocha ki kya sarkaar chunaav ayog se loksabhaa chunaavon ke saath jammu kashmir main chunaav karaane ke liye kahegi
 In response, Rajnath said that if the Election Commission wants this, then our government has no problem
 ISIS har roj apni hadon se aage nikalataa ja rahaa he
 The way ISIS has chosen to kill enemies, has shaken the world once again

 Because not only two living and seated humans are sitting on a pile of gunpowder, but both are waiting for their death every moment by being trapped in the clutches of ISIS
 apane dushmano ko maut dene kaieska ye tarika ajeeb, bhayanak or ghinauna he
 Two ISIS terrorists, caught on suspicion of espionage, took an orange colored jumpsuit to a wrecked building
 donon hi bandiyon kehath hathkadiyonse peeche kii taraf jakad die
 Far from escaping the two prisoners, the way they were brought to the table on the pile of mud, it became difficult for them to move properly
 raashtrapati ramnath kovind apane bayanon se lagaataar surkhiyon main rah rahe hai
 After Tipu Sultan, the new president's statement may once again upset the ruling party BJP
 ek taraf jahaan bijepi ke adhyaksh amit shah or anya netaa kerala sarkaar par lagaataar hamale kar rahe hai
 At the same time, President Ramnath Kovind has praised Kerala's model of health system and education
 jabaki kuch maheene pehle hi bijepi ke pramukh netaa or upi ke siem yogi adityanath ne kerala kii swasthya vyavastha kii aalochana kii thi
 President Ram Nath Kovindane said in a civilian reception in his honor that the role of Malayali employees of Kerala is important for the correct operation of any office in Delhi or Mumbai
 raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘‘dilli or mumbai or anya shaharon main koi bhi aspataal yaa vyaavhaarik rup se koi sarkari yaa corporate karyaalay malayalam karmchaaree ke yogadan ke bagaiyr sucharu dhang se kaam nahin kar saktaa
 Praising the role of the Malayali community in India's development, Kovind said, "this is true in many ways

 It has topped the business front
 ' unhone kaha ki malayalam pravasi samudaay kai khadi deshon ke shramik bal kaa bakabon he
 Addressing the function, he spoke about the 'unusual and important identity' of this coastal state
 saath hi kerala se sambandh rakhane vaale pravasi bharatiyon ke bare main baat karte hue raashtrapati ne kaha ki ve kerala or bharat ke vikaas main madad ke liye paise bhejte hai

 In such a situation, these words of praise can prick him
 raashtrapati ramnath kovind ne kuch din pehle tipu sultan kii tarif karke raajnneetik vivaad khadaa kar diya tha
 Addressing a joint session on the 60th anniversary of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, Kovind had said that Tipu Sultan was a martyr to the war fighting the British
 karnataka sarkaar saal 2015 se 10 november ko tipu sultan kii jayanti manaa rahi he, lekin is saal iskaa virodh tej hua he
 BJP is strongly opposed to this
 aise main raashtrapati kaa yah bhaashan soobe main bijepi ke rukh ke khilaaf mana ja rahaa he
 The BJP has also announced a massive demonstration against the birth anniversary of Tipu Sultan
 vahiin, raashtrapati ke bayaan ke baad bijepi netaa subramanyam swami ne tipu sultan ko hatyara qaraar diya he
 In Saharsa Hospital in Bihar, the news of a woman's operation was reported by a sanitation worker in the month of March
 isi se miltaa julata maamla amritsar se aayaa he
 The sanitation worker of Guru Nanak Dev Hospital in Amritsar was cheating in the name of treatment by writing medicines to patients suffering from mental illnesses
 safai karmchaaree ke doctor banane kaa raaj shanivaar ko us vakt khulaa jab guru nanak dev medical college kii principal doctor sujatha sharma achaanak aspataal ke neurology vibhaag main ain
 He saw a person sitting outside the OPD carrying slips of patients in his hand
 unhone use turant apana parichay dene ko kaha to vah sann rah gaya
 When Dr
 Sujata Sharma asked the doctor sitting in the OPD, he could not even recognize him
 uske baad duusare doctoron se poochtacha kii gai lekin kisi ne bhi use nahin pahachaanaa
 When the other staff of the hospital recognized him, everyone's senses were destroyed
 marijon ko ullu bana rahaa vah 45 varshiya safai karmchaaree ashok kumaar sabi tha
 When the search was carried out by the cleaning worker Ashok Sabi, dozens of slips of patients and even medical certificates were recovered
 sujatha sharma ne maamle kii gambhirtha dekhte hue turant jaanch baithai or puure maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh de die
 The case was investigated by the Medical Superintendent of Guru Nanak Dev Medical College, Dr
 surendra paal ne kii
 The investigation found that the accused sanitation worker has been working in the Department of Neurology for the last 15 years and has studied till matriculation
 uske padhe likhe hone ke kaaran aspataal prabandhan dwaara kai baar use opidi main marijon kaa panjikaran karne or unako sahi doctor ke paas bhejne kaa kaam bhi diya jaataa tha
 Taking advantage of this mistake of the hospital management, he befriended the shops selling medicines outside the hospital and he would often silently write the names of some medicines to patients as an excuse for not having a doctor available
 dawaaiyon ke naam kuch is tarah se likhe jate the ki dekhne vaale ko maaloom naa ho ki yah dawaai safai karmchaaree ne likhi he yaa phir doctor ne
 Investigation has found that Ashok Kumar was making big money by writing medicines for patients with mental illnesses
 haalanki philhal abhi yah maaloom nahin ho paaya he ki usne ab tak kul kitna paisa kamaaya he, lekin is ghatana ne aspataal prashasan kii laaparvaahee ujagar kar di he
 According to sources, there is a large network of fake doctors working around this hospital in Amritsar who are exploiting patients by writing medicines of their choice in the name of experts
 is bare main jabguru nanak dehospataal va college ke medical suparitendent doctor surendra paal se baat kii gai to unhone ajtak ko bataaya ki aaropee safai karmchaaree ne apana aparaadh kabool liya he or vah puri jaanch kii report somvaar ko medical college kii principal ko saunp denge
 Action is being taken against this vicious sweeper
 17 janvari 2015 ko sunanda kii maut ko puraa ek saal ho gaya, lekin 365 din baad bhi maut se jude sawaal vahiin ke vahiin hai
 Police says the SIT is investigating the case at a very fast pace
 is maamle main kabhi dhimi jaanch par sawaal uthe to kabhi jaanch kii disha bhatakaane ke bhi aarope lage
 AIIMS forensic department head Sudhir Gupta also alleged that he was pressurized to show Sunanda's death as normal
 -17 janvari 2014 ko sunda pushkar kii maut hui Post-mortem report came on 20 January, in which it was suspected that drug overdose may be the cause of death
 -jaanch main sunanda pushkar or shashi tharur ke bich jhagade or marpet kii baat saamne ai In the month of September, the viscera report stated the cause of death as poison
 -maut ko asamaanya maut bataaya gaya AIIMS team visited mouka-e-waraat in November -daure main kai aise saboot milane kaa daawa kiya gaya, jinhen na to police ne ricard par liya or na hi unhen saunpa - On December 29, the AIIMS Medical Board gave the final report, which again said that poison and abnormal death -1 janvari 2015 ko dilli police ne hatya kaa cese darj kiya In the last 15 days, Delhi Police has questioned the people working in Shashi Tharoor's house, other staff, post mortem doctors and doctors who are treating Sunanda before death
 iske alaava sunda ke dost sanjay dewan kaa bhi bayaan liya gaya
 Now it is the turn of Sunanda's husband Shashi Tharoor
 police kaa kahana he ki agle 2-3 dinon main shashi se poochtacha hogi
 Criticizing TDP chief n Chandrababu Naidu, Congress MP YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said that some sections tried to discredit his late father and former Chief Minister of the state YS Rajasekhara Reddy, but they did not succeed
 jagan ne kaha ki logon ke dilon main wiesar ke liye vishesh jagah he
 Some people are jealous, trying to discredit my father
 jo vyakti is duniya main nahin hai uske naam ko badnaam karnaa sabit karata he ki aise logon kii raajnneeti kitni ochhi he
 But such people will not succeed and the people who want YSR will give them a befitting reply

 Apart from this, the three people arrested are Mohammad Ilyas, Atiyur Rahman and Imran
 bataaya gaya he ki ye sabhi munwwar ke hi saathi hai or in dhamaakon main inhone bhi ahm kirdaar adaa kiya he
 Earlier also, 7 people have been arrested in connection with the Jaipur blasts
 in giraftaareyon ke baad ab jayupar police daawa kar rahi he ki wo jaldi hi dhamaakon kii sajeesh kii puri gutthi ko sulajhaa legi
 Everything seemed to be happening in Beijing that summer as planned
 bhartiya paksh bhi taiyaar hokar aayaa tha or puri tarah ashanvit bhi tha
 He laid out on the table his map and perspective of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the western region
 china ne bhi ek nakshaa mej par rakhaa tha lekin jaisaa ki andruni sutara kehete hai ki bina kisi spashtikaran ke usne use hataa liya
 Thus, where the LAC is actually located, the first serious attempt of its consent between the two countries came to an abrupt end on that day in June 2002
 china ke saath jaisaa ki praayah hota he, usne is baat kii koi safai pesh nahin kii ki sahasaa usne aisi harakat kyon kii lekin itane varshon main yah samajha jaataa rahaa he ki china vaastavik niyantran rekha kii bharat kii vyakhya se naakhush tha
 Therefore, he considered it futile to pursue this clearing process
 uske baad purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii china yatra ke baad hi vah seemaa vaarta phir shuru ho saki or jise ab seemaa ke sawaal par special ripregentative (esaaar) vyavastha mana jaataa he, uski shuruyaat hui
 After a decade, SR dialogue has also been affected because it has not progressed in recent years
 asal main rajnatik maanakon par 2005 ke samjhaute kii vyakhya or seemaa vivaad ko sulajhane ke disha-nirdeshon par matbhed bane hue hai
 Clearly, the border talks need a fresh perspective, as the issue cannot be avoided if Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ready to host Chinese President Xi Jinping
 khaskar tab jab bharat main ek sthaayee or majboot sarkaar he or china ke dushman padosi japan ke saath bharat ke majboot rishte hai
 It is as much an appropriate political opportunity to raise a controversial issue as it is to move forward on the economic front and integrate China's investment and expertise into India's economy
 china se vaarta ke mukhya siddhant ye ho sakate hai
 Tough stand on security issues, including border issues and relations with Pakistan with China, issues of multilateral benefits, such as political cooperation on climate change and new trade arrangements, and positive cooperation on bilateral economic cooperation at one-time negotiation table There is a need to bring in detail
 beshak, donon deshon ke bich sambandh virodhabhasi hi rahenge lekin rajnatik vaataavaran aisa ho ki har kshetra main avasaron kaa srijan ho sake
 The message should not be that development is going on at the cost of one area
 vaarta main yah najuk santulan banaae rakhana hoga, yahi modi kii kaabiliyat kii asli pariksha hogi
 The good thing is that the government seems to be shaping a strategy that can build strong economic relations with China
 udhaaharan ke taur par dedicated industrial park china ke bharat main nivesh kaa aadhaar banenge jahaan sarkaar chini vyapaariyon ke liye kuch pratibandhon main dheel de sakati he, inamen bijness vija ke niyamon main kuch dheel dene kii baat shaamil he
 Insiders say that similarly defined areas of investment are being prepared
 masalan, chini companiyaan bijli utpaadan upkaran main nivesh to kar sakengi lekin grid sthapit karne or sanchaalan main unki bhoomika nahin hogi
 Similarly, in rail also China will be able to invest in tracks and coaches, but it will not be allowed to invest in signal systems
 suraksha ke maamle main sarkaar pakistan par is aadhaar par china ke saath dwipaksheeya vaarta kii maang kar sakati he ki rajnatik asthirataa or badhata islamic ugravad, donon deshon ke liye khatra he
 Insiders say that Chinese President Jinping has provided appropriate opportunities for this by not including the visit to India as well as Pakistan
 lekin jahaan tak china ke saath seemaa vivaad kaa sawaal he to bharat sarkaar is mudde ko sirf vaarta se bharosa kaayam karne vaale kadamon tak le ja sakati he
 The SR system should be reoriented to arrive at a decision in this matter
 haalanki dirghakaal main rajnatik drushti se virodhabhaason se nibatane kii chunautiyaan saamne aaengi, jiske liye samvaad kaayam rakhana behad mahatvapurn he
 Four years ago, when Chinese President Wen Jiabao visited India, it was agreed to establish a hotline between the Prime Ministers of the two countries
 agle ekaadh saal main china ne to is aashay kaa upkaran laga liya tha lekin bhartiya paksh iske liye taiyaar nahin ho paaya tha
 Even today the hot-line has not been started
 aise muddon par vishwasaneeyata or kaabiliyat kii pariksha hoti he or yaheen modi ko nai pahal karne kaa avasar milegaa, jise ve apane rajnay ke kaushal se anjaam de sakate hai

 Taking part in the discussion on the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Lok Sabha on Monday, Manish Tiwari of Congress said, "this bill is unconstitutional, against the basic spirit of the Constitution
" jin aadarshon ko lekar baba sahab bhimrao ambedkar ne samvidhan kii rachana kii thi, yah uske bhi khilaaf he
 He said that the citizenship law has been amended eight times but there was never as much excitement as this time
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki yah anuchhed 14, 15, 21, 25 or 26 ke khilaaf he
 Manish Tiwari said that Article 14 of the constitution tells anyone to look at equality before the law of India
 lekin yah vidheyak barabari ke siddhant ke khilaaf he
 He said that the constitution talks about not discriminating with anyone on the basis of caste, religion, then how can one be discriminated against while giving citizenship
 congress saansad ne kaha ki aise main sanvaidhanik drushtikon se yah sabhi aadhaaron par uchit nahin he
 He said that the basic structure of the constitution says that every law should be secular, this bill also violates it

 Manish Tiwari said that there are some international treaties on this subject
 isamen kaha gaya he ki agar koi maanviya aadhaar par sharan maangata he to use panaah deni hogi
 It is also against that feeling
 unhone kaha ki aisa lagata he ki srilanka ke liye ek kanoon, bhutan ke liye doosraa, maldive ke liye alag kanoon banaaya ja rahaa ho
 The Congress leader said that it is also against the social tradition of India

 padhein is baatcheet ke mukhya ansh
 Question: Ravi you said that you can stay longer than we think? It depends entirely on the BCCI
 i will talk to them
 If things are right and both sides agree, then i have no problem staying longer
 sawaalh to aap hi coach kyon nahin ban jate?aap ban sakate hai
 But what difference will it make? Whether you are the director of the team or the head coach, it is the same
 yahaan teen or coach bhi hai wo apana kaam karenge or meraa kaam he sab vyavasthit rakhana main wo karunga
 Question: But will it not be like gathering many people? Will everyone be able to walk together? Hey! If you want, put 10 more people, i never had any problem in walking with people
 sawaalh main ek baar phir se doharaana chaahuungi, kya aisa nahin lag rahaa ki bahut saare logon ko unki bhoomika safataur par bataaye bina charge de diya gaya he?aap bhi doharaate rahiye main bhi doharaata rahoonga, ye koi masalaa nahin he
 Question: But people believe that there may be a problem of ego? You may think so, but all people are together and we are doing our work in peace
 kabhi koi masalaa nahin hua chintaa karne jaisi koi baat nahin he
 Question: But if you, as the head coach or team director, do not listen to the advice committee
 agar aap logon main asahmati ho jaae to?sabhi kii apni bhoomika he yadi sabhi apni bhoomika sahi se nibhaate hai to kabhi koi dikkat nahin hogi
 Question: According to you, things like lack of aggression, being more protective, and the manipulation in the team, which we saw during Dhoni's tenure, will not happen in Virat's time? Dhoni is a great player, he played his game very well, playing the game to high But we will see him again with the team in the ODI series

 i have told you how India is going to play, they will play aggressively and completely tension free

 An English newspaper has reported that Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Javed Usmani held a lengthy meeting with the Urban Development and Urban Planning Department on Friday and asked him to start work on the proposal to build three new ghats there
 ye teen ghat honge-lohia, rajanarayan or malviya
 They were being talked about for a long time, but now the government has awakened to hear about the development of 84 ghats of Narendra Modi

 You must have heard people say that the reconciliation that occurs after a fight-fight makes the relationship stronger
 aapke bich chaahe jitna bhi pyaar kyon na ho kabhi na kabhi ladaai ho hi jaati hogi
 Normally, battles happen when there is disagreement, but these are some of the places where the fight is going to take place: 1
 ek sathsafar karne ke daurangar aap saath travel kar rahi hai to aapke bich ladaai ho sakati he
 It often happens that women do not take care while packing that they are going to roam and not to settle
 jitna zyada saamaan utani adhik pareshaani
 In such a situation, your partner can irritate you
 2
 During a group dinner, if you have gone to a group dinner with your partner and other couples are sitting with you, then there is a possibility of a fight
 aksarpurush duusari mahilaonki tarif kar dete hai or ho saktaa he ye baat aapako pasand na aae
 In the middle of dinner, you ask him to come to the side and then express your anger
 aisa karne se aap donon kaa hi mood kharaab hoga or ghar lautakar ye anban ladaai main badal sakati he
 3
 party yaa shaadi ke dauraanparty yaa shaadi main jate hi kai kapal dusron se tulana karne lag jate hai
 Seeing the couple holding each other's hand, they start taunting their partner
 unhen ek-duusare se shikaayat hoti he ki ab wo unhen pyaar nahin karata yaa karti
 Such a situation can weaken the relationship and cause a fight between you
 4
 If your car is stuck in traffic, then control yourself in advance
 aksar aisi sthiti main parteners ke bich ladaai ho jaati he
 They start getting irritated at each other for being stuck in traffic
 5
 While the mother-in-law is around, it does not happen to everyone, but there are many couples that there is a fight between their in-laws when they are around
 aksar donon ko lagata he ki unke partner ke parivaar vaale unhen wo tavajjo nahin dete hai jo unhen milani chahie
 These are some of the situations in which there is an increased possibility of a fight between the husband and wife
 par agar donon hi thodi samajhadaari se kaam len to in ladaaiyon ko taala ja saktaa he
 BJP candidate from East Delhi and former cricketer Gautam Gambhir has sent a defamation notice to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Aam Aadmi Party candidate from East Delhi
 aatishi ne bhaajapa ummidavaar gautam gambhir par apane khilaaf aapattijanak bhashaa vaale parche baantne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Gautam Gambhir has said in this notice that by making a press conference and commenting on social media, he has made serious allegations against him, which has hurt his honor
 notice main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki gautam gambhir rashtriya or antarrashtriya str par kai match khel chuke hai, jinamein unhone kaaphi ran banaae hai
 He also played the innings that won India the T20 World Cup in 2007
 iske alaava unhen mili puraskaron or unke saamaajik kaaryon kaa bhi isamen ullekh kiya gaya he
 Gautam Gambhir has been told that he has no knowledge about these leaflets and has denied the allegations against him on social media and other means
 unhone kaha ki un par lagaae gaye aarope jhuthe niraadhaar hai
 Their aim is to damage Gautam Gambhir's image and spoil his election campaign
 notice main kaha gaya he ki gautam gambhir ko badnaam karne ke liye bina shart maafee maangi jaae
 Otherwise be prepared for legal action in this case
 kya he maamlagruuvaar ko aatishi ne daawa kiya tha ki unke pratidwandvi bijepi ke gautam gambhir ne nirvachan kshetra main aise parche bantwaaye hai, jo aapattijanak or apmanjanak hai
 Atishi had said, "my only question to Gambhir ji is that if he can fall so far to defeat a strong woman like me, how will he protect the women of his constituency after becoming MP
" "is par kejariwal ne kaha tha, 'kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki gambhir itane neeche tak gir sakate hai
 How can women expect to be safe if men are contesting elections with this mindset

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special news letters Such as Phool Hazarihari Mridul Samvad Publication, Meerut, Price: Rs 75
 sahaj raag-viraagah mridulyah yuva kavi hari mridul kii prem kavitaaon kaa sangrah he
 Mridul has tried to express the raga-virag, enterprise and vice versa that are instilled in the lover's life
 is jivan se jude saare kriya-kalapon ko lekar kavi kii ek sakaaratmak drushti he
 With his life experience, the poet realizes that the ventures made for love ultimately enrich life: for the sake of love i rubbed my face / bathed my body / cried / took hiccups / stood for hours / in the sun / rain In / in winter / all the ventures done for love / my work came
 prem main jo gopan he vahi mukhar he
 All such poet writers have written and said such things
 isi baat ko hari bhi apane sahaj andaaj main kehete hai: tum bhi chup / main bhi chup / is khamoshi kii / alag hi batakahi
 Like average people in love, Hari also eats, talks and films
 filmi baaten balki kuch zyada hi hai
 There is a section in the collection this time rainy
 isamen prem shabd kaa jaap kuch kam he, so kavitaayen kuch behatar bani hai
 In this, the poet's attempt to bring forth the sputum of love from life's experiences has been successful: saved from a thousand drops when the body got wet by a drop
 aisi boonden jahaan bhi girti hai, kavita main jaan aa jaati haih dubuk kii aawaaj ke saath achaanak ek machhlee / aati he or hamen duboti chali jaati he
 
 
 / In this way, it passes from morning to evening / We are not able to see the face in the rhythm
 in kavitaaon main prem kii us puraani ulatbaansi kii dhwani dekh sakate hai, jinamein 'jin duube wo paar' kii baat kahi gai he
 i have understood one thing in the poem also the poet says: to be immersed in love / to attain / ultimate knowledge
 param gyaan, param pavitra raat jaise param tatwon kii kuch zyada hi dugadugi bajaai he kavi ne
 These expressions would have been more effective if expressed in their simplicity through visuals and actions
 aapke pavitra-pavitra japane se koi aapako pavitra nahi maan letaa
 The feeling of purity should be effortless in poetry or in life
 nain sarovar / karunaa kaa jal / hont ke neeche / kaala til / jaise kandara / bas bhatakate raho
 The poet should overcome emotional sentiments like understanding a mole as a cave
 shamsher ke shabdon main, ''bhavukta kavi kii ek aisi puunji he jise vash main rakhana hi hoga, usase kaam lenaa hoga, na ki uski rau main bah janaa
 "it's good that Hari tried to write love poems
 kuch baaten acchhee ban bhi gai hai par kavi ko dhairya kii jarurat he
 You will not become a poet of love only by sticking the name of love on sentimentality and impassioned addresses
 sawaal prem kii jatilta ko abhivyakt karne kaa he
 Living with one eye, dying with another
 milan kii rut main neend kaa kafoor ho janaa
 To pretend to kill
 aise tamaam vaake hari ke yahaan bhi hai

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has become an attacker on opponents, accusing him of putting obstacles in the project of installing CCTV cameras in public places in the capital Delhi
 dilli vidhansabha chunaav main arvind kejariwal ne dilli main lakhon sisitivi camere lagaae jane kaa vaada kiya tha

 kejariwal ne soshal media par aarope lagaate hue likhaa, "agar dilli main CCTV camere lag gaye to bhaajapa or congress ko chunaav main daaru or paisa baantnaa mushkil ho jayega
 Kejriwal wrote that, "yesterday, Ek Bhajapaneta told that LG has been told not to allow CCTV cameras before the Lok Sabha elections in any way

 Initial questioning of Indira revealed that Malkhan Singh Vishnoi, a former MLA and Indira's brother, had made all the arrangements for her
 indira aasapaas ke ilaakon main jaakar chori-chhipe apane bete or pati se bhi milti rahati thi
 Indira rarely interacted with the local people
 philhal indira se poochtacha jari he
 Who was Bhanwari Devi Bhanwari Devi was from the Nat fraternity of Rajasthan
 vah jodhpur ke najadik pinen kasbe ke ek sarkari aspataal main bataur nurse kaam karti thi
 She was married
 modelling or rajasthani album ko seedhi banaakar bhavari rajasthani filmon kii heroin banane kaa sapana paale baithi thi
 So she could do anything to fulfill her dream
 gaanv ke aspataal main ek vahi nurse thi or wo bhi aksar duty se gaayab rahati thi
 Therefore, on the complaint of the villagers, Bhanwari Devi was suspended from her job
 congress vidhayak ke sampark main ai bhavariiske baad vah congress vidhayak malakhan singh or mahipal singh ke sampark main ai
 Both of them were taken by Bhanwari in trust
 un donon ne hi bhavari ko rajasthan ke jal sansaadhan mantri mahipal maderna se milwaaya tha, bas vahiin se is hatyakand kii ibaarat likhnaa shuru ho gai thi
 What role was Bhanwari Devi Kabhanwari Devi had with former MLA Malkhan Singh
 isliye bhavari ko malakhan ke parivaar main koi pasand nahin karata tha
 Taking advantage of this, Indira came close to Bhanwari and the two became friends
 indira bhavari ke ghar bhi aane-jane lagi
 He planned to remove his brother Malkhan Singh from the path of former minister Mahipal Madrenako to make him a minister
 indira ne bhavari kii nanad gudiya ke saath milakar mahipal madarena kii sex sidi banane kii yojana banaai, magar baad main gudiya ne isse inkaar kar diya
 Indira then used Bhanwari to make a sex CD
 indira ne kiya tha dabl crossmalakhan singh or indira ke pita purv mantri ram singh vishnoi jodhpur ke kaddavar netaa the
 After Ram Singh's death Indira Bhai also started planning to remove him from the road
 usne bhai malakhan singh ko fansaane ke liye bhavari ko aage kar diya
 She claimed that Bhanwari's younger daughter is the daughter of Malkhan Singh
 darasal indira khud hi mantri bananaa chaahati thi
 Finally, when Indira's entire game plan opened up and Bhanwri started bargaining herself, Indira along with accused Mahipal Madrena and brother Malkhan Singh kidnapped and murdered Bhanwari

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has openly supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of demonetisation, but now there is a discussion in the political corridors that whether Nitish Kumar has any expiry date for the support given to the Center? This question is being raised because JDU President of Bihar Pradesh Vashistha Narayan Singh has indicated that after the completion of 50 days, the Janata Dal United will review the issue of note closure
 gauratlab he kii pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh kii janata se 50 din kaa samay maanga tha jiske baad unhone aashwaasan diya tha ki logon kii pareshaaniyaan khatm ho jaaegi or desh ke halaat behatar honge
 The situation did not change even after 45 days, Sushri Narayan Singh said that the people of the country are facing a lot of problems due to the closure of the note
 45 din biit jane ke baad bhi jameen par halaat jas ke tas he
 The Janata Dal is reviewing the United note ban
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi pichley hafte is baat ke sanket die the ki 50 din kii miyaad puri hone ke baad vah khud note bandi ko lekar samiksha karenge or is baat ko samajhane kii koshish karenge ki aakhir note bandi lagu hone ke baad desh ke halaat sudhari he yaa phir bigadi he
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar had said that 'PM had said that corruption, black money and funding of terrorists will be banned after demonetisation and that is why we supported it
 50 din khatm hone ke baad ham is baat kii samiksha karen ki vaaki main yah tamaam chijen hui he yaa nahin'
 Vashistha Narayan Singh said that only after the review meeting, a decision will be taken against any kind of agitation against the closure of the note

 22 sitambar ko texas main piem modi kaa sambodhanhoudi modi kaarykram main shaamil honge donald trumpapahali baar itane bade kaarykram main donon honge shamilmerica raashtrapati donald trump 22 sitambar ko texas ke huston main hone vaale ‘houdi modi’ kaarykram main chif guest honge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the Indian community on his US tour, where more than 50,000 people are going to attend
 aisa pehali baar hoga jab trump-modi is tarah ek bade kaarykram ko sambodhit karenge
 However, the event will give a big message to the world when the leaders of the world's largest and oldest democracy are together
 duniya ko milegaa bada sandeshchin ke saath chal rahi america kii trade war or kashmir masale par pakistan ke saath bharat ke tanaav ke bich donon netaaon kaa yun saath aana bada sandesh detaa he
 India is an emerging economy and can take advantage of the ongoing china-us trade war, PM will discuss roundtables with big US businessmen on this tour
 america ne haal hi main jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 par bharat kaa saath diya he
 Donald Trump first talked about mediation, but later on India's tough stand, he said that mediation will happen only when India says it
 or piem modi ne saaf kaha ki ye bharat kaa hi masalaa he
 Modi's power in the US elections? The special thing is that next year the Presidential elections are to be held in America and the Premier elections will start from November this year
 aise main is kaarykram ko america raajnneetik pandit is nazariye se bhi dekh rahe hai
 In fact, there are close to 50 lakh people of Indian community in America, who can make anyone's head heavy during elections
 aise main har koi apane-apane tareeke se bhartiya samudaay ke votaron ko apni ore kheenchna chahta he
 This is the reason that Howdy Modi is joining not only Republicans but also Democrats mps
 2016 ke chunaav main bhi raashtrapati donald trump ne apane prachaar ke dauraan ‘abaki baar trump sarkaar’, ‘ai lav hindu’, ‘ai lav modi’ jaise naaron-shabdon kaa prayog kiya tha or bhartiya samudaay ke votaron ko lubhaane kii koshish kii thi
 Why is Texas special? Texas is the second largest state in America, both in terms of area and population
 yahaan agar votaron kii baat karen to kareeb 4 fisadi voter asian mul ke hai (2018 ke hisaab se), jisamen adhiktar sankhya bhartiya samudaay ke votaron kii he
 If we talk freshly, both the Congressmen (mps), governors in Texas belong to the Republican Party, but it has always been the stronghold of the Democrats
 iske alaava ek khaas aankada ye bhi he ki 2016 main jab america raashtrapati chunaav kii daavedaari main donald trump khadey the to vah texas main apni party main hi pichad gaye the
 During the Premier Election in the Republican Party, Ted Cruz received 43 percent of the vote and Donald Trump only 26 percent
 haalanki, puure america main badhat ke kaaran donald trump raashtrapati pad kii ummidavaari jeet gaye the
 After that, when the contest was between Donald Trump vs
 Hillary Clinton, Trump won 52% and Hillary got 43%
 pichley kuch chunaavon ke data ko dekhen to asian-bhartiya votaron kaa rukh hameshaa democrates ke taraf hi rahaa he, aise main ripulbican party kii taraf se hameshaa unhen rijhaane kii koshish jari rahati he

 Rizvi says that Pakistan is involved in this episode
 shiya vakf board chairman wasim rizvi ne dilli ke kalkaji peeth main tamaam akhaadon ke manhat ke saath saajha press conference main kaha ki, 'ye vivaad ek kalank kii tarah hindustan main fal-phool rahaa he
 More than 2000 murders and riots took place
 supreme court ne raay di he ki saare paksh sulah-samjhauta kar len
 Some so-called fundamentalists and clerics do not want the matter resolved as it is funding them
 pakistan is prakaran main shaamil he
 Because those people are not coming forward to respect the Supreme Court? The Shia Waqf Board was kept silent
 bina shiya vakf board kii manjuuri supreme court main shiya board kii ore se vakil kaise khadaa hua
 We have made our point in the Supreme Court
 mandir ko giraakar mandir banane vaala mir baaki tha jo babar kaa senapati tha
 According to history, Babur broke the temples to offer prayers to his army
 angrej nahin chaahate theki masalaa hal ho jaae
 The agents of the British are fighting over it till date
 hoicourt kaa faisla ek vivaadit jajment tha
 The Sunni Board does not have authority, only the Shia Waqf Board holds the authority
 baccha-baccha jaanata he ki ayodhya main ram janmabhumi he
 We proposed in a meeting of Shia Board that a temple should be built there and a mosque somewhere in Ayodhya, far from the premises of Parikrama
 'aage unhone kaha ki
 'we have prepared this draft to end the dispute and end the right over the Ram Janmabhoomi and give the rights to the Hindus and a mosque should be built in Lucknow
 ayodhya main masjid bani to vivaad rahegaa
 Who will offer Namaz at such a place? Will fundamentalists offer prayers from Hindus? We have drafted in the Supreme Court
 hamen court se insaaf chahie
 The court should decide what is the right of those who do not want compromise
 'vahiin nirvaani akhaada parishad adhyaksh mahant dharmadas jo kiraam janmabhumimaamle main pakshakaar bhi hai unka kahana he ki mandir nirmaan ke naam par kuch log bijness kar rahe hai
 Dharmadas directly attacked Ravi Shankar's mediation saying that fifty people like Ravi Shankar are roaming around to come on TV
 ravishankar vyapaaree vyakti hai
 Mahant Dharmadas says that the Ram temple should be built under the Akhara Council and the work of building the temple should start in the year 2017 itself
 vahiin akhil bhartiya akhaada parishad adhyaksh narendra giri maharaj kaa kahana he ki chunkishia board ne maan liya haito hamaara daawa majboot hoga
 We have not opposed the arbitration of Ravi Shankar
 wo bahut der se aae hai
 They should have come earlier
 sirf sunni vakf board asahmat he
 If consent is reached, it is not right, they are talking in the court, they will accept the court's decision ummid he shiya board kaa faisle se hamen madad milegi
 Will decide after the court's decision

 The BJP has a government and the temple will be built there in collaboration with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad

 court ne kaha ki supreme court main pawan ne jab apni punarvichaar yachika lagaai thi to usamen naaballig hone se judi koi baat supreme court ke saamne nahin rakhi gayi thi, aise main hycourt main lagaai gai ye yachika sirf samay barbaad karne ke liye lagaai gai he,taaki faansee kii sajaa ko taala ja sake
 Along with this, the court said that Pawan had never filed an application under section 7 (A) of the Juvenile Act, while the 2012 Supreme Court case up to 2018
 court ne kaha ki pawan ke pita ne apane bayaan main pawan kii janmatithi 17 june 1992 bataai thi, jabaki 2018 main uske skool kaa jo certificate diya gaya usamen uski janmatithi 8

 Pawan's lawyer AP Singh, who did not appear in court, did not appear in court today
 jabaki court ne unhen aaj 2
 Instructions were given to appear at 30 o'clock

 Pawan had challenged the order of the lower court in the High Court, today the same petition has also been rejected by the High Court
 isse pehle aaj court ne sunwaayee 24 janvari tak ke liye taal di thi lekin nirbhaya ke vakeelon ne court main dobaaraa menshning kii ki doshi pawan ke vakil e pi singh jaanboojhkar maamle ko lanbaa khinchne kii koshish kar rahe hai

 kal supreme court akshay kii punarvichaar yachika bhi khaarij kar chukaa he, isliye is maamle main ab hycourt dwaara sunwaayee yogya kuch bhi nahin bachaa he
 Therefore, Pawan's application in this case should be rejected
 pehle khaarij hui thi yachikapavan ne apni arji main khud ko ghatana ke samay naaballig hone kii daawa karne vaali arji 2017 main dilli hoicourt main lagaai thi
 The lower court has already rejected his plea, after which he came to the High Court to appeal
 nirbhaya ke gunaahagaaron main se ek pawan kumaar ne dilli hycourt main arji daayar kar daawa kiya tha ki disambar 2012 main ghatana ke vakt wo nabalig tha
 Medical examination was not conducted to check the age through the investigating officer, so he should be given the benefit of doubt under the Juvenile Justice Act

 If it is proved that Murdoch misled mps, he would have to bear the legal consequences
 varavikshire ke daure ke dauraan camran ne kaha, safataur par james murdoch ko sansad ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dena hoga or main aashwast hum ki vah aisa karenge
 He said, News International has some big issues to deal with and the management of the company has to fix the upsets
 samiti ke adhyaksh jon vittingdel ne kaha ki vibhinn binduon par murdoch samiti ko likhakar dene ko taiyaar hai, jisapar vah sunwaayee ke dauraan bolne main naakaam rahe
 He said, i am convinced that if Colin Mayer and his statements do not match, we will also ask them to respond to this
 lebar saansad watasan ne bibisi ko kaha ki phone hekking kii do saal kii jaanch main yah sabase ahm pal he
 Watson said, "if (mayer and Crone's) statements are true, then it shows that James Murdoch had known since 2008 that others were involved in hacking
" yah dikhaata he ki vah apane karmiyon ko anushaasit karne yaa andruni jaanch shuru karne main naakaam rahe or yah hamaari samiti ke samaksh kiye gaye rupert murdoch ke is daawey ko kamjor karte hai ki company galat karnaamon ko bilkul bardaasht nahin karti
 He said that even more important is that he not only failed to register the crime with the police, but he bought Taylor (the chief footballer of the Association of Professional Footballers) to keep quiet
 watasan ne kaha ki iskaa matlab yah ho saktaa he ki vah jaanch kii disha bigaadane ke liye jaanch kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Murdoch told the committee that he was not aware of the e-mail that reported the use of hacking by the News of the World reporter
 samalangik pyaar kaa aisa namoona dekhne ko nahin milegaa

 You must be wondering what Fidel's dealings with literature? Really if v in Hindi
 ke
 If Singh had not written this book 'fidel Castro', we would not have been discussing him here
 fidel kastro apane jeevankaal main puri duniya main samrajyavad-virodh kaa pratik ban chuke the
 At the age of just twenty-five, Fidel Castro, with a handful of comrades and without outside help, left Cuba's dictator Batista and its cherished American imperialism from Cuba forever
 cuba ke shoshit-peedit kisaanon, mazdooron ko krantikari yoddhaon main badalane vaale or apane desh ko saamaajik nyaay ke siddhanton par ek behatar raashtra ke rup main viksit karanevaale fidel kastro ne antararashtriyata kii nayi paribhaashaayen gadhin or samoochee duniya ko har tarah kii vishmata se mukt karne kaa ek bada sapana dekha
 Today every person in the world feels close to his heart who wants to transform this world into a safe habitat for the future of man
 cuba kii kranti kaa para-dar-para itihaas bataanevaali is pustak ke centre main fidel kastro kaa jivan he
 Stimulated by the author's extensive research and deep commitment, this book provides a factual account not only of Fidel's life, but also of the politico-economic circumstances in Cuba and the rest of the world between which Fidel emerged and the Cuban Revolution was possible
 is pustak main kranti kii prerak us vichaar-nidhi ko bhi paryaapt sthaan diya gaya he jiske kaaran fidel kaa sapana, pehle cuba or phir duniya ke har nyaaypriy vyakti kaa sankalp bana
 This book also gives us a close insight into Fidel's most trusted partner Che Guevara, whose only purpose in life was to fight against imperialism wherever in the world, and despite sacrificing life at a young age Those who are alive in every conscious young heart today! Fidel: a live revolution, a true life Fidel Castro is not judged in the realm of events and achievements Can be
 darasal, fidel ko kisi bhi daayre main rakhkar nahin parkhaa ja saktaa
 Fidel is the name of an idea, an ideal, a dream
 manushya or manushyata kii aseem sambhaawanaaon kaa naam he
 Thoughts, ideals, dreams and possibilities are not fallacious of boundaries
 anginat naamon or oopaadhiyon- cubai kranti kaa commandent en jeffe (commander-in-chif), meximo lider (mahanatam netaa), cuba kii aadhi sadi kaa rashtradhyaksh, nae cuba kaa nirmaataa, nai duniya, nae samaaj kii ummid, cuba kii counsil of state kaa adhyaksh, cuba kii communist party kaa pratham sachiv- in sab simaaon se pare keval ek naam fidel ke vyaktitv krititv kii mukammal pahchaan he- 'fidel
 In the context of the Cuban revolution, Fidel says: "cuban revolution has to be understood from the Cuban perspective
 ' fidel ke jivan ko bhi fidel ke nazariye se dekhnaa-samajhnaa hoga
 According to Fidel, he has lived his entire life with ease and peace
 america yaa phir uske chand sahyogiyon dwaara fidel ko taanashaah, krur yaa sanakee qaraar die jane ko lekar fidel kaa kahana he ki yah duniya main nafrat kaa jehar failaane kii samraji muhim kaa hissaa he
 They think that if you keep on preaching that this man is dangerous than Satan, people will gradually start hating him
 fidel kaa praadhikaar aitihaasik sandarbhon se unhen hasil janata kii shakti, janata ke bich prabhaav or janata ke sammaan par aadhaarit he, jiskaa unhone kabhi durupyog nahin kiya- manamaane nirnay, aadesh, yaa decri se kabhi sarkaar nahin chalaai
 Cuba does not have a presidential system of government
 rashtriya sansad or mantri parishad he, uskaa samuhik netritv he
 Every important decision is taken collectively after thinking-understanding-deliberation-debate
 raashtrapati dwaara mantriyon yaa rajdooton kii niyukti nahin hoti
 If its name is dictatorial, then it is a problem of such thinkers
 kisne apana sara jivan anyaay ke khilaaf, har tarah ke daman-shoshan-atyaachaar ke khilaaf, dusron ke liye kaam karte hue, dusron ke liye ladate hue, logon ke bich ekajutata, sahyog or apnatv ko viksit karte hue bitaayaa he? kisne hameshaa manushya kii shaareerik or maansik garima kii suraksha kaa dhyaan rakhaa he? cuba main kisi bandi ko yatnaa nahin di jaati, kisi kii hatya nahin hoti, koi 'gaayab' nahin, koi 'safaya' nahin hota
 An emergency was never imposed in Cuba - never a single stick, tear gas, or bullet fired at any protest
 in sabakaa ek apwaad bhi nahin mil saktaa
 The revolution of Cuba is the revolution of the people, the nation as a whole, achieved by their own blood, their strength and protected by their own support, their efforts and their courage
 tamaam africa, asian, latini america deshon kii janata ke apane atyaachaari-krur-dalal shoshakon se mukti kii aawaaj par cuba ke lakhon noujvaan swayamsevakon ne unke sangharshon main saath diya, apana khun bahaya, shahaadatein deen

 latini america or puri duniya se dasiyon hajaar chaatr chikitsa-vigyaan kii visheshgy shiksha muft hasil kar rahe hai
 If all these are named dictatorship, cruelty and cynicism then it is a problem of thinking
 apane jivan ke bare main fidel kaa kahana he ki vah hameshaa, khud ko lekar sabase kathor rahete hai, hameshaa apni galtiyaan nikaalte hue, khud se ladate hue
 They believe in work, not on appearance
 aap ko hameshaa apane andar se, apni pravritiyon se ladate rahanaa hota he
 They believe that it is teaching, serious and persistent, never-ending self-learning that makes a human being a human being
 insaan kii urja kaa strot uski shaareerik kshamta nahin, uskaa sankalp, uski patibaddhta he- isliye umr ke saath urja ghatati nahin, zyada utsaah, zyada patibaddhta, zyada aaveg laati he
 Fidel never disappoints, never gives up, never leaves the field
 janata par unka avichal vishwaas he, janata ko lekar kabhi unhen niraashaa-hataasha nahin hui
 Fidel says that in his entire life, he may have had to deal with barely two-four incidents of betrayal
 krantikari sangharsh or navnirmaan abhiyaan ke 90 netaa fidel ke 26 july aandolan se rahe hai
 There was no one among them who had betrayed the revolution
 sabake sab apane antim dam tak kranti ke saath or kranti ke liye jite rahe
 Recalling his allies, Fidel states that all the warriors who were the companions of the Moncada or Granma expedition - Che, Camilo, Raul, Almeida, and all the companions - Valdes, Garcia - all the commandants of the revolution were or were extraordinary people Lived with steely commitment to every moment of judgment, on one occasion, without being distracted for a single moment
 aaj kranti ke saath un agali pidiyon ke nae vichaaron, nae mulyon, nae khun or nai urja kaa bhi hujum he, jo kranti vijay ke samay tak paidaa nahin hue the
 They do not know how many revolution heroes, warriors, martyrs have been born from the blood
 ye kabhi kranti ke saath vishwasghaat nahin kar sakate
 Regarding his uniform, Fidel says that he has always been wearing it since the time of the Sierra campaign and feels himself most comfortable in it
 isaki aadat si ho gai he
 There has been almost no change in Fidel's uniform since the time of Sierra
 anginat sangharshon ke vijayi yoddha fidel apni vardi par koi tamgaa, koi alankaran nahin lagaate
 He also remembers wearing civilian clothes in the days ahead that at the 1994 ibera-american summit of Santiago de la India, Colombian hosts urged all heads of state to wear Colombian traditional apparel 'guayaabera'
 uske baad se vah anterrashtriya baithkon-sammelnon ke avasar par or cuba main bhi vishesh avasaron par 'naagarik suut' pahante rahe hai
 Fidel was handed his first cigar 'puro Habano' at the age of 14–15 by his father
 tabase vah baraabar cigar pite rahe or yah unki chhavi, pahchaan kaa ek hissaa ban gai thi
 Fidel did not touch the cigar for nearly thirty years
 fidel kehete hai ki yah desh kii bhalaai or janata ke swasthya ke liye unka jaruri tyaag tha
 Hearing the terrible side effects of obesity, arbitrary lifestyle and tobacco health, Fidel decided that he should give up this habit in the interest of public health
 apni galatiyon ko lekar fidel kaa maananaa he ki unhone galtiyaan kii hai magar ve sab kaarynithik bhuule thim na ki ranneetik bhoolen
 The Cuban nation and society never regained their regrets for their efforts for the Navnirman

 Experts say that since the new notes of 500 and 2,000 rupees are different from the size-type of the old notes, the trays of the ATM machines have to be tailored to them and the software of the ATM machines will also have to be changed

 ) Jaitley said on Saturday, "the Finance Ministry is constantly monitoring the process of converting cash
 ' jisase unhone puraane noton ko hataakar nae note laane kii prakriya main lagane vaali deree kii ore hi sanket diya he
 When asked why the government did not make these changes in ATM machines beforehand, Jaitley said that this would have ended the 'secrecy' of the government's surprise move
 siemes ke upaadhyaksh evam mukhya kaaryakari adhikari rajeev kaul ne bataaya ki sarkaar kii ghoshnaa ke baad tatkaal kadam atm mashiinon se puraane noton ko hataanaa hona chahie

 'this is the real challenge
 kyonki sabhi atm mashiinon ke trey badalane honge
 ATM machines will also have to be tested before filling new notes
 kaul ne bataaya, 'hamaara maananaa he ki deshbhar kii atm mashiinon main ye saare badlaav karne main do se chaar saptaah lag jaaenge
 Anuj Chauhan, a bank worker in Delhi, said that to reconfigure an ATM machine, a technician would have to go to the ATM machine himself and the entire process could take up to four hours to reconfigure one machine
 iskaa matlab he ki desh bhar kii atm mashiinon ko riknfigar karne main aath lakh ghante lagenge

 ab ye dedline badha kar 30 april kar di gai he
 Explain that while giving a strong message against corruption, Yogi had asked all ministers to give full details of their movable and immovable property to the organization and the Chief Minister's secretary in 15 days
 sutron kii maane to kaaphi vyastata ke chalate kuch mantri apane property kaa byoraa nahin de paae hai
 Earlier, the Modi government at the Center also sought details of movable and immovable property from its ministers

 Many people have a problem that their salary ends before the end of the month
 iskaa kaaran hota he unke aseemit kharche karnaa or plan banaakar nahin chalanaa
 In such a situation, you have to keep many things in mind about your budget, so that you do not have to face this problem every month
 aaie jaanate hai kya hai wo baaten
 
 
 Track expenses - If the problem of ending the money is also with you, then first of all, sit for a day and find out what you are spending more in every month
 aisa karke ek list bana len or yah list puri eemaandaaree se banaaen
 Write openly about your expenses and then consider where your expenses are going higher
 jab tak naukari nahin mil rahi, tab tak aise kamaayen paisaplan banaaen-jab aap apane kharchon ke bare main pataa kar len to uske baad apana bajet plan taiyaar karen
 Make a list of wasteful expenses in these expenses and also make a list of such expenses, where you can deduct
 iske baad dhire-dhire is plan ke anusaar apana kharchaa karen
 In this, you can also make your plan according to every day
 bachat kar nivesh karen-paisa bachaane ke liye bachat karnaa shuru kar den
 Also, when you accumulate a little money, invest it somewhere, your money will also be safe and you will also benefit from it
 iske liye aap epady, muchuel fund aadi kaa sahaara bhi le sakate hai
 Start this business along with the job, soon it will start earning a different means of earning - if you do some work from which you can earn extra income, then definitely start working
 iske liye aap koi chota project haath main le sakate hai, jisase ki aapako selary ke saath alag se inakam ho
 Say no to the party - nowadays people are spending more money in junk food or party etc
 If you do this too, then try to stay away from them
 isamen aapaki sharaab, cigarette, hotel kharchaa aadi shaamil he
 You can earn good money only by cutting them a bit

 Tejashwi Yadav, the younger son of Leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly and Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Yadav, is back in Patna
 tejasvi yadav, jo vipaksh kaa netaa rahane ke baavjood ek maheene chale vidhansabha satr main maatr do din kuch minute ke liye sirf cheharaa dikhaane aae aakhirkaar apane pita lalu yadav ke kehane par waapas aae hai
 The father has assured him that according to his wish, whatever important position he holds after the father in the party will be given to him after the election of the organization
 lalu yadav ki is sahmati ke baad ab party ke netaa jinamein bhai virendra jaise kuch varisht netaa bhi shaamil hai,maang karne lage hai ki tejasvi yadav ko agar party kaa bhi netritv diya jaataa he to isse rajya ke yuvaaon ke bich ek acha sandesh jayega
 At present, brother Virender is not alone in making this demand
 unke alaava bodh gaya se nirvaachit vidhayak kumaar sarbajit, jamui se vidhayak vijay prakaash bhi ab saarvajanik rup se is maang ke samarthan main saamne aae hai
 It is believed that only after receiving green signal from Lalu Yadav, these people are publicly demanding that the future of the party will be better by handing over the command of the party to them
 haalanki party ke kai varisht netaa aise bhi hai jinka maananaa he ki tejasvi yadav ne lok sabha chunaavon ke baad apane aacharan se party ke vidhayak, kaaryakarta or netaaon sabhi ko niraash hi kiya he
 These leaders say that even if you get any post Tejashwi Yadav by emotional blackmailing Lalu Yadav, the truth is that even now the present Chief Minister Nitish Kumar does not see a far-reaching option
 in netaaon kaa tark he ki jo vipaksh kaa netaa vidhansabha satr se hi gaayab rahe
 Do not go to see people in the flood
 chamaki bukhaar jaisi mahamari ke samay dilli main ghumta rahe
 With those stunning Yadavs, there can be politics on social media, but not on land
 agar phir bhi vah chunaav jeet jaaen to ye apane aap main badi uplabdhi hogi

 anupgarh se vidhayak shimla baawari ne haal hi main ek kaarykram ke dauraan yah khulaasa kiya
 The event was called by local journalists in his honor
 sammaan kii vajah yah thi ki vidhayak shimla baawari ne jile main patrakaron ke liye plot aavantit karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 'three journalists said - will take money later' English newspaper 'the Indian Express' has given this news quoting Shivla Bawri's speech at the program
 apane bhaashan main vah khud sweekaar rahi hai ki unhone apane vidhansabha kshetra ke patrakaron korupayon ke lipaphe bhijwaaye
 He also said that the three journalists returned the money saying that they would take it after winning the election
 vidambnaa yah ki apane bhaashan main vidhayak sahiba ne patrakarita ke girte str par bhi khed prakat kiya
 When the newspaper contacted him to find his side on the video, he dismissed the allegations and said that the video has been tampered with
 video se chhedchhad hui: vidhayakaunhone kaha, 'yah moorkhtapurna he
 This is a false video
 ek chota sa patrkaar he jo do panne kaa pakshik akhbaar nikaalata he or uske jariye logon ko pareshaan karata he
 In the video, BJP mlas are seen saying, 'I come from a poor family
 lekin jab maine chunaav ladaa, jitna main kar sakati thi, maine gharsanaa, anupgarh, rawala kesaare patrakaron ko lipaphe bhijwaaye
 Many journalists in Anupgarh have confirmed to the newspaper that they had received an envelope of Rs 11,000 from Shimla Bawri

 When i was asked to write about the future of the Congress, i was very hesitant
 aakhirkaar mahaj duusari baar taaja-taaja jeet kar aayaa hum or is naate main party main abhi nayaa hi hum
 i am also not a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), nor a member of any other deciding committee of the party
 lekin phir, maine congress kaa ek nirvaachit pratinidhi hone ke naate yah chunauti sweekaar karne kaa man banaaya, kyonki main apni party ke asamay ant kii kahaniyaan padhakar chakit hum
 Although i am the spokesperson of the All India Congress (AICC), i would like to clarify that these are my personal views
 sabase pehle khulkar yah kahana chaahunga ki hamaare ant kii kahaniyaan kaaphi badha-chadhaakar bataai ja rahi hai
 The Congress is fully alive and still holds a good hold among the public
 desh ke aam chunaavon main hamen bas 20 fisadi vot mili, isse ham behad vibhajit or pratispardhi raajnneeti main apraasangik nahin ho jate
 We are in power in 13 states and we have a presence across the country, which no one can add
 phir bhi loksabhaa main mahaj 44 siton par simat janaa dukhad he or sudhaar kii jarurat kaa ehsaas hota he
 What could be this improvement? The eight suggestions of policies, principles and programs can be: We decide what our objective is and make it effective to the public continuously
 congress ke mul siddhant un mulyon se bane hai jo use aazaadee ke andolan se hasil hue hai, khaskar samekit vikaas, saamaajik nyaay, garibi unmoolan or alpsankhyak, aurat, dalit tathaa adivaasiyon sahit tamaam haashie ke logon ko suraksha muhaiyaa karana
 Theoretical commitment to them is merely distorted as vote bank politics
 ham bharat kii vividhta ke rajnatik pairokaar hai or dharmanirpekshata ke buniyadi usul kii raksha ke prati puri tarah patibaddh hai
 We need to repeat these values vigorously at every opportunity
 iskaa matlab yah he ki hamaare netaaon ko apane sankoch kii aadat chhodkar soshal media sahit sabhi manchon par oonchi aawaaj main in mulyon par jor dena hoga
 By doing this, our values, programs, intentions and concerns will reach more people
 agar ham logon se apni baat karenge to unhen ham apane paksh main aasaani se laa sakate hai
 There is a need for open dialogue in 21st century media-based politics, which the Congress has avoided in recent years
 bhavishya kaa najariya viksit kiijie, jisamen desh ke bahusankhyak yuvaaon kii aakankshaayen samahit hon
 Astonishingly 40 per cent of voters this year are under 35 years old
 ve hamase jaananaa chaahate hai ki unke liye hamane kya kiya he or kya kar sakate hai
 Our party has taken many initiatives in the direction of education and skill development, but these efforts have been insufficient in terms of employment generation
 hamen is kshetra main aisi nitiyaan taiyaar karne kii jarurat he jo hamaari party ke shashan vaale rajyon main lagu hon or centre ko unke bare main bataaya ja sake
 The youth of the country will have to make sure that we understand their expectations and assure them to take them forward in the government
 bijepi ko rashtrawaad par ekadhikaar kaayam na karne den
 The Congress has the deepest experience of protecting the national interest and should proudly express its nationalism and maintain proactiveness in matters of security and foreign policy in which the BJP government is negligent
 haalanki hamaari parampara rahi he ki har tarah ke rajnatik virodh desh kii dharti tak hi simit rahete hai, videsh niti kaa maamla kisi party kaa nahin, balki puure desh kaa hota he, phir bhi hamen bijepi ko apni sarkaar ke jariye yah jaahir karne kii chhot nahin deni chahie ki vahi ekmaatr desh ke gaurav kii raksha kar sakati he, jise lekar hamaari paribhaasha kuch alag dhang kii ho sakati he
 Play the role of constructive opposition outside and within Parliament
 iskaa yah arth katai nahin he ki bijepi ke bahumat ke aage samarpan kar den
 But by merely protesting for opposition (as the BJP has done during the UPA regime), we will stand against the mandate given to Modi and be the victim of public anger
 desh main yah bhaavana bah rahi he ki ‘‘un logon ne itane samay tak raaj kiya, ab unhen mauka kyon nahin dena chaahate?’’ isliye yah hamaare hit main he ki bijepi jab bhi koi sakaaratmak pahal kare to ham uskaa saath den or jab koi vibhaajankaree agenda laae to uskaa datakar muqabla karen
 Focus should be on strengthening the party at the ground level
 congress vaaki kai rajyon main jamini str par sampark tod chuki he
 We should pay more attention to elections to panchayats and local bodies
 desh ke zyaadaatar logon ko sarkari pechidagi or bhrashtachar se paidaa hone vaali choti-moti samasyaon par hamen dhyaan dena chahie, jin samasyaon ke liye votaron ne hamen sajaa di he
 We should convert our politics into social work for the deprived and vulnerable
 party ke bheetar loktantr ko badhaava den or antarkalah par kaabo paaen
 Rahul Gandhi is constantly focusing on this
 seedblusi se lekar sabhi pramukh padon par aantarik chunaav karaae jaaen
 Advancing leaders locally and in states
 lekin party hit ke khilaaf apni vyaktigat mahatvakankshaon ko tarjeeh dene waalon or asantosh paidaa karne waalon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karen
 In recent elections, many leaders have shown dissatisfaction
 jab party aisa rukh nirvaachit netaaon ke prati apnayegi to chunaav na ladgaye vaale darbariyon ke maamle main or kadaa rukh apnaanaa sambhav ho paaegaa
 Focus on practical alliances with other parties so that regional parties do not take advantage of the anti-government forum
 agar bijepi sarkaar ke mukhar virodh kaa laabh kshetreey partiyon kaa gathbandhan uthaa le jaataa he to iskaa hamen sidhe-sidhe nuksaan hoga
 We are the largest national opposition party, so we should create a common platform to protest against the unacceptable policies of the BJP government
 rajnatik talmail se hamen sansad ke alaava vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi tagdi takkar dene kaa mauka mil jayega
 But we also have to take care that our local party unit's furnace does not sit in the circle of this coordination
 isse lambey samay main ham un rajyon main majboot vikalp banakar ubhar sakate hai jinamein kareeb dhai dashakon se ham satta main nahin hai
 These states are especially Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu
 in rajyon se loksabhaa kii 201 siten aati hai isliye ham inaki katai upeksha nahin kar sakate
 Surround the central government on center-state relations
 ye aise mudde hai jin par ham kshetreey partiyon ke saath milakar manch saajha kar sakate hai
 We have 13 state governments and we have a political interest in raising voice against the monopoly of the center
 iske saath hi hamen apni rajya sarkaron ke achche pradarshan par dhyaan dena chahie taaki yah sabit ho sake ki hamaari party sarkaar chalaane ke kaabil he
 This is what BJP wants to snatch from us
 iskaa matlab yah bhi hota he ki hamen apane kuch rashtriya netaaon ko rajyon main party ko majboot karne ke liye bhejnaa padegaa
 Anyway, after the new system in Delhi, there is no more left to do
 ye suzav kaaphi lambey-chaude nahin hai, lekin meri raay main yah desh kii sabase puraani party ke aage badaae or purana gaurav lautaa laane ke liye kuch ahm sutara hai

 Akshay also asked the media persons on the film's event to actually contribute instead of showing their solidarity on Twitter
 akshay ne kaha, "mujhe sirf riyect nahin karnaa or 'so sad' twitor par nahin daalana he
 i will request you all, do not put this, do something
 chaahe wo ek chavanni kyon naa ho or 25 lakh rupee kyon naa ho or 25 karod rupee kyon naa ho
