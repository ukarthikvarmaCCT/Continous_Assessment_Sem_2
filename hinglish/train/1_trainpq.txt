 "the top five places vary according to the mood of the people," said Devgan
 yah anavaratata he jo bahut myne rakhata he or kalakaar ko sabhi prakaar kii bhoomikaayen karne ko icchhuk rahanaa chahie
 "from a serious role like Bhagat Singh on the big screen to stalking roles on girls and a two-time National Award winner, Devgan says he does not want to compare himself to anyone

 '' supreme court ne 17 march ke faisle main jaaton ko 'pichhadon' kii fehrist main shaamil karne ke centre sarkaar ke 2014 ke faisle ko palat diya or is tarah jat samudaay ko anya pichhadaa varg (obisi) main milane vaale aarakshan ke phaayde ke liye ayogy ghoshit kar diya
 There was a mixed reaction to this as expected
 kai media tippaneekaron ne iskaa swaagat kiya or kaha ki yah "aarakshan kii raajnneeti ke liye jhatka" he
 But the All India Jat Reservation Struggle Committee and Jat leaders opposed it
 hamen in pratikriyaaon se aage jaakar vichaar karne kii jarurat he ki aakhir supreme court ne is faisle main aarakshan ke labhaarthiyon kii pahchaan ke tareeke ke bare main kya kaha he
 But first we must remember why the need for positive discrimination was felt
 agar ham aazaadee ke pehle ke aarakshan ke itihaas main na bhi jaaen, to bilkul saaf taur par yah jarurat isliye mahasoos kii gai thi, kyonki sabhi hindustaniyon ke liye kanoonee barabari (jo sanvaidhanik or kanoonee vyavastha ne pradaan kii he) or jamini yatharth main buniyadi barabari yaa 'vaastavik barabari' ke bich bahut faasla tha, or he
 This brings us to the next question: how do we identify those individuals / groups / communities who need special emphasis to provide basic equality? Several Articles-15 (4), 16 (4), 46, 355 of the constitution-empowers the state to create a land of equal opportunities for socially and economically backward communities, so that it can be taller than the more prosperous communities
 Their inconvenient conditions are being reduced from time to time, due to which they have to fight non-equal from the beginning
 aarakshan kii bahes main baar-baar uthne vaala sawaal yah he ki 'pichhadepan' ko paribhaashit karne vaale tamaam aadhaaron main jati ek kasuti honi bhi chahie yaa nahin
 This question can (and should) be answered only by experiences
 kya tathyon or aankadon ke vishaal ambara se jati ke aadhaar par lagaataar aaj bhi kaaphi asamantaaon or bhedbhaav ke saboot milte hai? agar haa, to jati sachmuch suvidhaheenata kaa ek aujaar he
 But to make special provisions to remove backwardness in the true sense, there is a need to repeatedly examine the evidence based on experience
 isliye bhi ki vakt ke saath us jati vishesh kii haalat main badlaav aana tay he, or isliye bhi ki suvidhaheenata (jaise sex ke maamle main pasand) ke duusare pahalu ubharkar aa sakate hai (or siddhanthata jati kii praasangikta khatm ho sakati he)
 In the case of obcs, in particular, the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) is considered to be the institution that evaluates the justification of claims made for inclusion in the Central List of Other Backward Classes
 farvari 2014 main ayog ne nau rajyon kii (in nau main se saat rajyon main jaaton ko rajya sarkaron kii soochiyon main pehle se hi obisi ke taur par darj kar liya gaya tha) samiksha sarkaar ko saunpi thi or usamen is nattejey par pahunchaa tha ki jat samudaay ke taur par pichhadepan ke maapdandon ko puraa nahin karte
 But the central government ignored this recommendation and issued a notification declaring the Jats as obcs
 supreme court ke faisle ne ek daawey vishesh ke enasibisi ke akalan ko jaij tehraaya he, or uchit hi jaij tehraaya he, or jati ko pichhadepan ke aadhaar ke taur par khaarij nahin kiya he
 The NCBC has made 33 amendments to the list of obcs since 1993
 aisa usne 1,221 darkhwaaston kii jaanch ke aadhaar par kiya he, jinamein 766 ko manjuur karke shaamil kiya gaya or 455 ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 Similar changes were made in the SC / ST list
 pehle-pahal 1935 main aazaadee se pehle banaai gai 'dalit virgon' kii suchi ke zyaadaatar hisson ko jari rakhte hue 1950 main anusuchit jatiyon kii suchi taiyaar kii gai thi
 The first amendment was made in 1956 and Dalit Sikhs were added
 isi tarah is suchi main 1976, 1986, 1990 (navabaudhon ko joda gaya), 2000, 2002, 2003, 2007 or uske baad bhi badlaav kiye gaye
 Similar changes were also made in the ST list
 misaal ke liye, 2001 kii janaganana ke baad se asti suchi main 242 tabdiliyaan kii gayi, jinamein 235 jatiyon ko jodgaye or 15 ko hataane ke alaava or bhi badlaav kiye gaye
 The Supreme Court in its judgment has emphasized the evidence-based assessment of backwardness and stressed the need for continuous review on the basis of 'contemporary evidence'
 iske saath hi, adaalat ne labhaarthiyon ko namjad karne ke tareeke kii jhalak saarvajanik taur par dikhaane kii ijaajat di he
 Without doubt, the new standards are welcome
 ab ummid kerani chahie ki pramaan par jor dene ke natijatan labhaarthiyon ko namjad karne main or saath hi sakaaratmak karrwai (jiske abhi tak samaaj main phaayde hi zyada dikhe hai) ke kathor akalan main nishpakshta or paardarshita donon aaengi
 Those who are hailing the Supreme Court verdict as a blow to 'casteist politics', should support this decision in its entirety
 unhen ve joardaar saboot sweekaar karne ke liye bhi taiyaar rahanaa chahie, jo bataate hai ki jati badakismati se aaj ke samakaleen bharat main bhi suvidhaheenata kaa ek ahm aujaar bani hui he

 Of the two openers, you need to be a bit aggressive and i think he accepted the challenge
 use manoj ke anfit hone ke kaaran team main shaamil kiya gaya tha isliye uske paas mauka tha
 The good thing is that he accepted the challenge
 ’rohit ne buudhvaar ko 83 ran banaae lekin jab dhoni se poocha gaya ki agar yah ballebaaj aaj vifal hota to kya hota to bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘yah mushkil sawaal he

 Hospital sources say that the case of GP hospitalized Snehlata alias Neha Sharma (22) took a dramatic turn yesterday when the father of this girl Mahavir Prasad Sharma, who claimed the death of her parents in the Kedarnath tragedy, was with her
 When he arrived, he refused to recognize them
 vahiin, mahavir prasad ke saath ai snehalata kii choti bahan aayaushi ne bhi aspataal pahunchakar mahavir prasad ko pita maanane se inkaar kar diya
 However, by the evening, on the persuasion of the hospital management, the Aayushi accepted Mahavir as his father and Snehalata also gave his consent in this matter
 ullekhneey ki pradesh main bhind nivasee snehalata ke mata-pita gat 13 june ko kedarnath tirth yatra par gaye the
 When Snehlata heard the news of floods in Kedarnath on television, she left for Haridwar to find them on 20 June
 is bich, snehalata ko beemaari kii haalat main haridwar ke shaantikunj sthit madhyapradesh ke raahat shivi main pahunchaaya gaya, jahaan se mukhyamantri chouhan use apane saath lekar gat somvaar ko bhopal aae the
 The Chief Minister also announced a government job after the woman claimed her parents' death
 duusari ore, sarkari sutron ne bataaya ki haridwar ke raahat shivi main mili jis yuvati ko mukhmayantri ne mata-pita ke khone par naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi, uske bare main bhind ke esadm ko jaanch karne ko kaha gaya he
 If the parents of this girl will not be alive, then in that case she will be given a government job
 aspataal main die bayaan main mahavir prasad kaa kahana he ki uske chaar bete or teen betiyaan hai
 He was going to Kedarnath with his wife Vidyadevi on June 13, but could not proceed beyond Haridwar due to rain on the way
 vahiin, snehalata kaa kahana he ki uske do bhai or chaar bahanen hai
 He also told that two sisters and two brothers have died along with parents in Kedarnath
 mahavir prasad ke saath ai snehalata kii choti bahan aayaushi ne bhi kuch ghanton ke baad use pita maanane se inkaar kar diya
 She said that she considers him like a father, so has come with him
 haalanki shaam ko doctoron or pulicekarmiyon ke samajhane ke baad mahavir prasad ko apana pita bataaya
 The Ayushi did not answer why he denied it in the morning
 tippaniyan Later Snehlata also accepted Mahavira as her father
 is puure maamle ke baad mahavir prasad ne kaha, ‘‘bhagwaan aisi aulad kisi ko nahin de
 i do not want a daughter who does not consider me a father
 yadi main uskaa pita nahin hota to use dekhne kyon aata
 '' is samooche maamle par rajya vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh ‘rahul’ ne ek bayaan dekar kaha he ki mukhyamantri chouhan uttrakhand aapadaa ke prabhaviton ke naam par sasti lokapriyata paane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 This is the reason why the Chief Minister looted accolades, the whole story turned out to be false and the Chief Minister is under suspicion and controversy
 aspataal sutron kaa kahana he ki jeepi aspataal main bhartee snehalata urf neha sharma (22) ke maamle main kal us samay naatakeey mode aa gaya, jab kedarnath traasadee main apane mata-pita kii maut kaa daawa karne vaali is yuvati ke pita mahavir prasad sharma usase milane pahunche, to usne unhen pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya
 At the same time, Aneeshi, the younger sister of Snehlata who came with Mahavir Prasad, also refused to consider Mahavir Prasad as father after reaching the hospital
 haalanki shaam hote-hote aspataal prabandhan ke samajhane par aayaushi ne mahavir ko apana pita maan liya or snehalata ne bhi is maamle main apni sahmati de di
 It is worth mentioning that the parents of Snehlata, a resident of Bhind in the state went on a Kedarnath pilgrimage on June 13
 snehalata ne jab televijan par kedarnath main baadh kii khabar suni, to vah 20 june ko unhen dhundhane haridwar ravaanaa ho gai
 Meanwhile, Snehalata was rushed to the relief camp of Madhya Pradesh at Shantikunj in Haridwar in the condition of illness, from where Chief Minister Chauhan took her along with him to Bhopal on Monday
 yuvati dwaara mata-pita kii maut kaa daawa kiye jane par mukhmayantri ne use sarkari naukari dene kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di thi
 On the other hand, government sources said Bhind's SDM has been asked to investigate the woman found in the Haridwar relief camp after the chief minister announced a job for the parents' loss
 yadi is bacchee ke mata-pita jivit nahin honge, to usee sthiti main use shaskeey naukari di jaaegi
 In the hospital statement, Mahavir Prasad says that he has four sons and three daughters
 vah apni patni vidyadevi ke saath 13 june ko kedarnath ja rahe the, lekin raste main barish hone ke kaaran haridwar se aage nahin ja sake
 At the same time, Snehlata says that she has two brothers and four sisters
 saath hi usne bataaya tha ki kedarnath main mata-pita ke saath do bahanon or do bhaaiyon kii maut ho gai he
 Aneeshi, Snehlata's younger sister who came with Mahavir Prasad, also refused to consider her a father after a few hours
 usne kaha ki vah unhen pita jaisaa maanati he, isliye unke saath ai he
 However, after convincing doctors and policemen in the evening, Mahavir described Prasad as his father
 usne subah is baat se inkaar kyon kiya, is bare main aayaushi ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 The comments baad main snehalata ne bhi mahavir ko apana pita sweekaar kar liya

 BJP leader Ram Kadam said that Congress and NCP are trying to isolate Shiv Sena
 ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ke congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat ke baad yah baat kahi
 He said that for the last 28 days only meetings of the three parties are being held, when will they form the government? Kadam said, 'congress and NCP are trying to shore up Shiv Sena
 jab rajyapal ne sarkaar banane ke liye 24 ghante kaa samay diya tab shivasena ke netaaon ne kaha ki hamen 24 ghante or dijie
 He said, the ideology of the three parties is different
 pichley 28 dinon main wo agenda tay nahin kar paae hai
 They are making fun of democracy and the people of Maharashtra

 Suspense after Pawar's statement! Actually, there is a suspense situation on the formation of government in Maharashtra

 Only after taking the opinion of all the leaders will we decide the way forward
 sharad pavaar ne yah bhi kaha ki swabhimani shetakari sanghathan bhi hamaare saath he
 His legislators win

 Pawar said, we will take all the parties in confidence
 sarkaar gathan par ensipi kii taraf se bhi koi sakaaratmak bayaan nahin aayaa he jisase shivasena kii sthit saaf ho sake
 In such a situation, the government does not seem to be formed in Maharashtra at present

 CPI-M leader in the Lok Sabha Mohammad Salim and party general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Tuesday that after polarizing in the name of religion, the government now wants to polarize votes on the basis of caste in the guise of giving reservation to the upper castes
 mohammad saleem kaa yah bayaan somvaar ko kendriya mantrimandal dwaara liye gaye us faisle par aayaa he, jisamen aarthik aadhaar par saamaanya varg ke logon ko 10 pratishat aarakshan dene ke sarkaar ke prastaav ko manjuuri di gai he
 The Constitution Amendment Bill, necessary to implement this decision, has been introduced in the Lok Sabha by the government on Tuesday
 sarkaar kii manshaa par sawaal uthaate huemakapa netaa salimne kaha ki samvidhan sanshodhan ke liye jaruri vidhaayi prakriya kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya he
 He said neither the Constitution amendment was listed in the agenda of the Lok Sabha nor the members were provided with a copy of the bill
 unhone kaha ki mangalvaar ko lunch se pehle jari hone vaali sanshodhit kaarysoochee main vidheyak ko shaamil karne se saaf he ki sarkaar bina sarvanumati kaayam kiye, ise sadan se paarit karana chaahati he
 Reservations received in the private sector, while Sitaram Yechury, stating that reservation is just an electoral stunt, said that unless the private sector is brought under the purview of reservation, it will not be of any benefit
 unhone kaha ki makapa mandal ayog ke samay se hi aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan kaa samarthan karti rahi he
 Therefore, the party will support this decision of the government, but the standard of fixing the income limit of Rs 8 lakh for reservation is impractical

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been severely accused of corruption by AAP leader Kapil Mishra
 shanivaar ko mantrimandal se hataae jane ke baad kapil mishra ne aaj kejariwal par satyendra jain se 2 karod rupee ghoose lene kaa aarope jad diya he
 Due to which the politics of Delhi has become hot
 kejariwal main lage aarope se saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare bhi dukhi hai
 Anna Hazare very sad
 In conversation with 'aaj Tak', Anna Hazare said that he is very sad to see the news of corruption related to Kejriwal on TV
 is maamle main wo pehle puri jaankaree lenge uske baad hi koi raay denge
 Anna says that Kejriwal has reached the chief minister's chair only by fighting the war against corruption
 haalanki unhone kaha ki bharosa to unka usee din tut gaya tha jab kejariwal ke mantriyon par tamaam tarah ke sangeen aarope lag rahe the or unhen istipha tak dena pad rahaa tha
 Let me tell you, at Delhi's Jantar Mantar, Kejriwal emerged from Anna's agitation against corruption
 jiske baad kejariwal kii aguwai main raajnneetik party banaai gai or dilli kii satta tak pahunchi he
 It is a testimony, not an allegation
 
 
 kejariwal par bhrashtachar ke aarope se vipaksh ko baithe bithaae mudda haath lag gaya he
 Because Kejriwal continues to accuse leaders of all parties of corruption
 aise main agar AAP ke netaa hi agar kejariwal par rishwat lene kaa aarope lagaate hai to phir vipaksh kaa hamalavar hona lajimi he
 Delhi BJP state president Manoj Tiwari called Kapil Mishra's statement not testimony but allegation
 unhone kaha ki aarope to vipaksh lagaataa he or lagaate aae hai
 But what Kapil Mishra is saying is a testimony against Kejriwal for straightforward corruption
 isliye kejariwal ko mukhyamantri ke pad par bane rahane kaa koi naitik adhikaar nahin he, unhen tatkaal istipha de dena chahie
 BJP MLA from Delhi Vijender Gupta has questioned Kejriwal's silence, asking that Kejriwal say, 'kejriwal ji talks on small talk then why is he still silent? Come in front of people '
 vijendra gupta kii ore se jari press vijyapti main up-rajyapal se ek vishesh jaanch team banaakar maamle kii jaanch karne kii apil kii gai he
 Gupta says that Kapil Mishra should put the details of this alleged scam in front of the public
 saath hi satyendra jain kii benami sampatti kii bhi jaanch honi chahie
 Sisodia in defending Kejriwal, however, the allegations against Kejriwal were dismissed by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia
 unhone kaha ki kapil mishra ke aarope bebuniyaad hai
 No one would believe the charge of taking money from his own minister
 is aarope kaa koi aadhaar nahin he
 Sisodia said that it is worth noting that Kapil Mishra has made allegations after being removed from the post of minister
 kapil mishra ne mantri satyendra jain par kejariwal ke ek rishtedaar kii 50 karod rupee ke ek jameen ke saude main madad karne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 Congress demanded resignation Congress President Ajay Maken said that the Center, the Prevention of Corruption Bureau and the CBI should take immediate action in the matter and file an FIR against Kejriwal

 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main unhone congress ke sagar meghe ko ek lakh vot se zyada ke antar se haraaya tha
 This time too, there is a tough fight between the two leaders
 kya rahaa he itihaas
 
 
 If we look at the history of Wardha Lok Sabha seat, this seat was once a Congress stronghold
 yahaan 38 saal se zyada congress kaa raaj rahaa
 The first election was held in 1951 and Shriman Narayan Agrawal won
 iske baad 1957, 1962, 1967 main kamalnayan bajaj lagaataar teen baar chunaav main jite
 Then came 1971 Jagjivan Ganpatrao Kadam on Congress ticket

 After this, in 1980, 1984 and 1991, Vasant Rao Sathe reached the Lok Sabha by winning consecutive elections
 jab pehali baar khulaa makapa kaa khaataa
 
 
 The first CPI (M) account in the Wardha parliamentary constituency was opened in 1991
 yahaan se makapa ke ramchandra ghangare saansad chune gaye the
 It may be known that there was a direct contest between Congress and CPI (M) in Wardha for nearly two decades
 lekin makapa keval 1991 main hi jeet darj kar paaya
 BJP came to Wardha for the first time
 
 
 wardha loksabhaa seat lagaataar do saal tak congress se dur rahi
 The CPI-M too could not do anything special here and in the next ie in the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won the election here for the first time and Vijay turned MP
 is jeet ke baad congress or bhaajapa ke bich yahaan sidhi takkar ho rahi he
 Now there is a competition between BJP and Congress
 
 
 wardha main bijepi or congress ke bich hi kadaa muqabla mana jaataa rahaa he
 Here BJP sometimes wins and sometimes Congress
 1998 main yahaan congress ke datta meghe jite
 He was followed by incharge of Congress in 1999, Suresh Waghmare of BJP in 2004, Dutta Meghe of Congress again in 2009 and reached Parliament
 lekin 2014 main phir bijepi ke ramdaas tads chunaav jite
 What is the status of assembly constituencies
 
 
 wardha loksabhaa seat ke antargat 6 vidhansabha seat aati he
 These include Wardha, Hinganghat, Arvi, Deoli, Dhamangaon railway in Amravati district and Morshi assembly constituency
 yahaan abhi bijepi kaa kabza wardha, hinganghat, morshi vidhansabha kshetron main he
 At the same time, the Congress is in the Deoli, Arvi and Dhamangaon railways

 The last list of National Citizen Register (NRC) has been released
 is list main 19 lakh 6 hajaar 657 log baahar hai
 They also include a 50-year-old woman, Dolan Sengupta
 inkaa naam enarasi kii aakhri suchi se khaarij kar diya gaya he
 Angry, Dolan has challenged the NRC Co-ordinator to prove him a foreigner
 dolan ek gruhinee hai or unki shaadi 22 saal pehle assam main us parivaar main hui jo 1846 main guwahati main aakar basaa tha
 Dolan said that her maternal uncle is in Hooghly district of West Bengal and she has already spent a lot of money to collect all the documents from her maiden, as no one lives there now
 unhone kaha ki ab nagarika sabit karne ke liye fahrenurs tribunel main jane ke liye wo or kharch vahan nahin kar sakati hai
 Dolan Bolin- Why should the Foreigners Tribunal go? Dolan said, 'I was dismissed as a citizen and now i am being asked to go to the tribunal
 aakhir mujhe fahrenurs tribunel kyon janaa chahie
 When i have passport, PAN card and Aadhaar card
 main chunauti detii hum ki wo mujhe videshi sabit karen
 'he further said that i have all the valid documents, so why should i go to another court
 unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika janaa matlab phir kharch
 i am a housewife, who will bear the cost? Dolan said that if the documents were not required, then why did the NRC officials scrutinize the documents? Dolan's husband Subrajyoti is a businessman by profession, but as an aware citizen, he is demanding details of the expenditure of Rs
 unhone poocha ki enarasi par 19 lakh logon (enarasi suchi se baahar) ke dwaara 1600 karod rupee kharch kiye gaye, unamem unki patni kii tarah hi kai log shaamil hai
 Subrajyoti Sengupta says that my point is that my wife's name has been rejected without any basis, so i am now questioning the process of NRC
 kya yah sahi tarika he, kya isse bharat ke sabhi nagarikon ke saath sahi ho rahaa he
 He also said that those whose names have been included in the NRC list, was it done honestly
 unhone kaha ki jinke naam enarasi main nahin he unhen fahrenurs tribunel jane ko kaha gaya, yah kis aadhaar par he? kya iskaa matlab videshiyon se yaa vahaan jane kaa matlab he ki main sweekaar kar rahaa hum ki main ek videshi hum, aakhir hamen vahaan kyon janaa chahie
 This is a cheap way, for which rupees 1600 crores was wasted
 unhone kaha ki main enarasi ke is parinaam se asahmat hum or ab to mujhe unki saakh par bhi andeh he
 Let me tell you that the Sengupta family has been living in the Panbazar area of guwahati since the 19th century, but now they are being asked to prove their citizenship on this basis, which is raising more questions than they answer
 suchi main maa kaa naam nahiiske alava guwahati ke ek or sadi ke nivasee rudeep saraswati apni maa kaa naam enarasi suchi main nahin hone ke kaaran chintit hai
 Rudip asked, 'was NRC officials sleeping for the last six months? If there was a problem with the documents they could call us
 meri maa 68 saal kii hai
 His name is not in the list
 ab unki nagarika sabit karne ke liye main unhen ek jagah se duusari jagah kaise le jaaoongaa?' The Indian-origin journalist who reported on the Brexit poll faced racial remarks on the streets of her hometown in southern England

 After a long silence, the special state issue is being raised again
 ek saavdhaanee jarur barat rahe hai
 By making the attack on Lalu Yadav more intense, he is also expressing that his options are no longer Lalu
 unhone kaha he ki prashanth kishor (prashant Kishore) lalu ji se mili the or nitish phir paala badalanaa chaahate the
 This revelation from Lalu ji's book has raised the ears of the BJP
 shivanand tiwari ne kaha he ki nitish (nitish Kumar) ji saavdhaan hai, vishesh rajya or lalu (lalu Yadav) kaa tikhaa virodh, donon swar ek saath nikaal rahe hai
 When Baliavi ji sees Nitish Kumar as the Prime Minister, he is not only saying his own mind but he is also telling the mind of Nitish Kumar and his immediate circle
 prashanth kishor ke laluji se milane kaa sandarbh bhi yahi tha
 The RJD leader has said that now Delhi has gone far away from Nitish Kumar
 dilli unke najadik thi, jab ve sangh mukt bharat banane kii baat kar rahe the
 Fearing the name of the man whose name cropped up, fear spreads in the minds of crores of minorities
 usee se ladane kaa sankalp lekar unhone laluji se haath milaayaa tha
 But today the people who had to fight, are roaming about it
 tiwari ne kaha he ki ab to nitish (nitish Kumar) ko 23 may tak dhiraj rakhana chahie anyathaa uphaas ke paatr ho jaaenge
 Because with his colleagues Nitish ji does not seem to get seats even in the double digits
 aisi haalat main to dilli kahaan, patna bhi khaali karnaa hoga
 It looks like it! uttar pradesh ke hisse vaale bundelkhand kshetra ke hamirpur janapad ke kundara gaanv main sirf mahilaayein hi holi khelti hai
 It is forbidden for men to play Holi
 dilachasp baat he ki jab desh-videsh main purush samudaay holi ke din rang main ranga hota he or iskaa anand le rahaa hota he, vahiin bundelkhand ke is chote se gaanv main holi ke din gaanv ke sabhi purush kheton main yaa kisi duusare kaam se kahin baahar chale jate hai
 Even more interesting is that generally, where children are eager to play Holi throughout the year and buy colors ranging from the pitch, the children of Kundra village stay in homes wearing clean clothes on the day of colors
 aisa lagata he, maano holi nahin, diwali ho
 The women of the village remain completely free on this day
 saal ke 364 din jo mahilaayein gaanv ke bujurgo ke saamne parde main rahati hai, ve holi ke din kisi se ghunghat nahin karatin
 The people of the village say that on the day of Holi, the women of the whole village gather in the Ram Janaki temple of the village and play Holi with pomp after singing the song
 dilawar singh, ramdin meshram or vivek thakur ne bataaya ki kai dashak pehle holi ke hi din gaanv ke log ramjanaki mandir main phag ga rahe the, tabhi ek inami dakait member singh ne rajpal naam ke shaks kii goli maar kar hatya kar di thi
 After this incident, Holi was not celebrated in this village for many years
 kuch saal tak to mahilaayein chup raheen, phir unhone purushon ko samajhane kii koshish kii or jab ve nahin maane to gaanv kii sabhi mahilaayein usee ram janaki mandir main ikattha huin or faisla liya ki holi ke din gaanv kii sabhi mahilaayein puri rasm ke saath tyohaar manaaengi
 There will be no participation of men in this
 tippaniyan Since then only women in the village play Holi, men do not participate
 is baat ko kaaphi samay guzar chukaa he, lekin yah shaayad ekmaatr anoothaa gaanv he, jahaan sirf nari shakti hi holi khilne kaa anand leti hai
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team

 isse bhi dilachasp baat he ki aamtaur par bachche jahaan puure saal holi khilne ko bekaraar rahete hai or pichakaari se lekar rangon kii kharid karte hai, vahiin kundara gaanv ke bachche rangon ke parv ke din saaf-suthere kapade pahanakar gharon main hi rahete hai
 It seems like it is Diwali, not Holi
 gaanv kii mahilaayein is din puri tarah aaazaad rahati hai
 364 days of the year, women who live in the curtain in front of the elders of the village, they do not veil from anyone on the day of Holi
 gaanv ke log bataate hai ki holi ke din gaanv ke hi ram janaki mandir main puure gaanv kii mahilaayein ekatra hoti hai or phag gane ke baad dhoomdhaam se holi khelti hai
 Dilawar Singh, Ramdin Meshram and Vivek Thakur said that several decades ago, on the very day of Holi, the villagers were singing in the Ramjanaki temple, when a prominent dacoit member, Member Singh, shot and killed Rajpal
 is ghatana ke baad is gaanv main kai saalon tak holi nahin manaai gai
 For a few years the women kept quiet, then they tried to convince the men and when they did not agree, all the women of the village gathered in the same Ram Janaki temple and decided that all the women of the village would celebrate the festival on Holi day with full rituals

 The ghosts that Congress leader Jagdish Tytler believed to be missing, resurfaced on April 10
 dilli kii ek adaalat ne is din sibiai ko nirdesh diya ki 1984 ke dangon ke maamle kii nae sire se chaanbin kii jaae
 The CBI had filed the case in 2009, stating that no evidence could prove to prove Jagdish Tytler's role in the riots
 kadakaddooma kii ek adaalat main atirikt satr nyaayadhish anuraadhaa shukla bharadwaj ne sibiai kii report thukaraate hue usase kaha ki chaanbin jari rakhe or phir se gavaahon ke bayaan le
 There could not have been a better opportunity for BJP to get such an order when the party is looking to make Gujarat riot tainted leader Narendra Modi a prime ministerial candidate in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 ab tak bijepi 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon kaa zikr dabi jabaan main kiya karti thi lekin 10 april ke is aadesh ne unki jhijak khatm kar di or bijepi netaaon ne sari topein congress kii taraf mode deen
 He even accused former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of instigating riots and reminded his famous line, "when a big tree falls, the earth is moving
 ”bijepi pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman saaf shabdon main kahati hai ki ''gujarat main jo hua vah sampradayik danga tha, lekin 1984 main dilli main jo kuch hua vah ekatarfa katleam tha

 If s Phoolka had not fought with full devotion and enthusiasm, these ghosts would have slept
 —asit jolly or jayant shriram The problem of water logging from Patna city is currently over
 is jal jamaav ke yun to kai kaaran rahe lekin wo chaahe bhaajapa samarthak hon yaa virdohi, sab maanate hai ki agar ek vyakti jisaki laaparvaahee kaa sabane kaamiyaaza uthaaya wo hai susheel modi
 And this malefic situation in the capital Patna has brought the biggest damage to one's personal and political image, that is Bihar's Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi
 susheel modi ne patna kii har samasya main aam logon ke saath khadey hokar apni vyaktigat raajnneetik chhavi chamakaayi or saath-saath bhartiya janata party ko lagaataar pichhali paanch vidhansabha chunaavon se har seat par jeet dilaai
 The same Sushil Modi has lost everything in this time of water, according to his supporters
 sabase bada sawaal he ki aakhir susheel modi kii kya laaparvaahee he? iskaa jawaab he bihar kaa jo nagar vikaas vibhaag he usamen pani ko lekar samiksha niyamit rup se susheel modi hi karte aae hai
 Therefore, if any agency of the department missed or the people responsible for the cleanliness and maintenance of the city were not alert, relaxed, then Sushil Modi cannot run away from this responsibility
 jaise ki jal jamaav ke dauraan ve apane ilaake ke logon ko chhodkar khud NDRF kii naav se apane parivaar ke logon ke saath nikal liye
 Sushil Modi also knows that this video and picture of him caused the biggest damage to the political capital of one of his responsible politicians
 unki party ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki agar din main hi unhen nikalnaa tha or sthiti bahut hi mushkil vaali ho gai thi to ve apane parivaar waalon ko pehle bhej dete, khud prabhavit ilaake main kuch ghante sthiti kaa gauge lete or shaam main media ke camere se dur apane ilaake ko by-by kehete
 But today if you go to his Rajendra Nagar house, then every neighbor who used to praise him has now been awarded the title of the most insensitive leader
 iske baad bhi ve apana ilaaka ho yaa patna ke anya jal jamaav se prabhavit ilaake, daura karne ko shaayad apni vifaltaa or janata ke aakrosh se bachane ke liye jane se bachein
 While living in opposition in this city, he was the first to take care of the people who also undertook fast for drainage and people could not forget them
 lekin unke samarthakon ke anusaar raajnneeti main jaisaa hota he satta main vyakti ahankaar main ati aatmavishvaas kaa shikaar hota he or aaj unki party har din adhikariyon ke kilaaf maang kar rahi he
 With whom Modi is still holding review meetings before and after water
 smart city ho yaa namaami gange sab patna ko doobane se bachaane main fel rahe or in sabko lekar modi apni peeth thapthapate the
 But this time's disaster revealed his lack of both ability and efficiency as a minister
 vahiin kisi traasadee main sarkaar main baithe dal kis had tak apni hi sarkaar ko gherne main kis had tak ja sakate hai, uskaa namoona bhi dekhne ko mila
 Earlier, in a tragedy in Bihar, when lakhs of people were trapped in the media, there was no such media game to see each other
 isaki aguwai susheel modi jis party ke aakiri shabd hote the, usne kiya or ve mook darshak bane rahe
 However, Union Minister Giriraj Singh is said to have calmed down after talking to the central leadership of his own party
 lekin is puure prakaran se party par unki pakad ab kitni kamazor hui he wo saafe dikhaa
 But while Sushil Modi was engaged in controlling damage on the political front, no one digested going out with his family instead of taking care of the people of his city
 haalanki har saal durga puja or christmas ke dauraan ve patna se baahar jate hai
 But this time when the water has not been completely discharged from his city, people are facing a new problem every day, then by giving priority to the family, except for the people, Sushil Modi further tarnished his image
 bachaa khuchaa asar dashahra ke din ho gaya
 BJP leaders did not participate in Patna's Gandhi Maidan program, only to show that they do not desist from doing politics anywhere
 bijepi ke netaa mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kaa bycott kar rahe the or susheel modi ko isaki jaankaree thi yaa nahin thi, paristhitiyon main sandesh to yahi jaataa he ki susheel modi kii ab prashasnic or raajnneetik donon pakad kamazor hoti ja rahi he

 On this day a person can get complete happiness in life by worshiping Mahadev
 is din vrath, upwas, mantrajaap tathaa raatri jaagran kaa vishesh mahatv he
 The month of Sawan is the month of Shiva, so Shivaratri of Sawan assumes special significance

 magaratanki sanghathan islamic state(isis) ke sargana bagdadi ne sainkadon bacchon ko aisa hi bana diya he
 Actually he wants to use these children as a havoc
 kehete hai bachche kachi mitti kii tarah hote hai
 The mold in which molds are molded
 lekin is bagdadi kaa kya karen, jo bacchon ko dehshatgardi ke saanche main dhaalane main laga he
 That is why thousands of children in countries like Syria and Iraq are learning the lesson of dying in the clutches of ISIS today, at an age in which human beings do not even know how to live properly
 islamic hukumat ke naam par aatank kii aagturki main iesas kaa raaj to nahin he, lekin iesas is mulk kii dahalij par jarur khadaa he
 Because Iraq and Syria adjoining Turkey are the places in which a large area is occupied by ISIS
 lekin ab turki kii phija main bhi iesas ke khauf or bagdadi kii hukumat kii bechaini mahasoos kii ja sakati he
 It is just that there are thousands of refugees who have escaped from the clutches of ISIS in Turkey, there are also many innocent children, whom ISIS had thrown into the fire of terror in the name of Islamic rule

 The children involved in these camps are not only undergoing very severe physical training, but are also given a commitment to commit to ISIS and its Khalifa Baghdadi to be completely cut off from the rest of the world, regardless of their parents
 Why not? bacchon ko fidaayin bana diyabagdadi or uske aatankwaadi har maheene teen se chaar sau bacchon ko agava karte hai or unhen aatank kii factory main jhonk dete hai
 Would you believe that in this factory, even children up to eight years of age are taking training from taking a bullet on the chest to taking off the head of an innocent person
 lekin isse bhi zyada afsosjanak ye he ki usne kai aise bacchon ko fidaayin bana diya he, jo dimagi taur par bhi duusare bacchon ke mukaable kamjor hai
 Arbitrary ISIS, in the name of making soldiers, calls these children as cubs under the rule of Cubs of Baghdadi and brainwashes them and prepares them for death
 haalat ye he ki kai propeganda videos main jahaan aise bacchon ko logon kaa katl karte hae dekha ja saktaa he, vahiin zyaadaatar bachche aise hai, jinhen faujee banane ke naam par manamaana kaam karavaaya jaataa he or to or dimagi taur par laachaar kai bacchon ko fidaayin yani maanav bam bana kar iesas ne apni gandi jehniyat kaa ek or saboot diya he

 jabaki 2011 main jin chaatro ne 10veen kaksha main board pariksha dene kaa chayan kiya, unka 2013 main paas pratishat 82

 Lord Rama killed Ravana and that is why the festival of Dussehra is celebrated
 lekin ye wo tathy he jise ham sab jaanate hai
 But here we are telling some facts about Dussehra, which you hardly know
 
 
 1
 Dussehra is made up of Sanskrit words dasha and hara
 jiskaa sidhaa arth hota he surya kii haar
 It is said that if Lord Rama had not killed Ravana, the sun would have been permanently lost
 2
 Dussehra is also known as Vijayadashami
 jiskaa arth hota he dasven din kaa vijay
 It would also have its significance in the form that Maa Durga killed the demon Mahishasura on the tenth day
 3
 Mahishasura was the king of the Asuras, who persecuted the innocent people
 uske atyaacharon ko dekhakar bhagwaan brahma, vishnu or mahesh ne shakti kaa nirmaan kiya
 There was a 10-day war between Mahishasura and Shakti and finally the mother won the 10th day
 4
 It is believed that in Navratri, the mother comes to her maternal house and on the tenth day, she bids farewell
 yahi vajah he ki loganvaratri ke dasven dinaunhen pani main visarjeet karte hai
 5
 ek manyata yah bhi he ki shri ram ne ravan ke dason sir kaa vadh kiya tha, jise pratikaatmak rup se apane andar kii 10 buraaiyon ko khatm karne se jodakar dekha jaataa he
 Sin, deeds, anger, attachment, greed, pride, selfishness, jealousy, arrogance, inhumanity and injustice are the ten evils
 6
 It is said that Dussehra was first celebrated in the 17th century under the reign of the king of Mysore, 7
 yah tyohaar sirf bharat hi nahin bangladesh or nepal main bhi manaaya jaataa he
 Dusshera would have been a national holiday in Malaysia
 8
 Dussehra festival is also associated with changing seasons
 dashahra se sardiyon kii shuruyaat hoti he
 It is also the season for kharif cultivation
 kharif kii kataai hoti he or diwali ke baad rabi kii boai shuru hoti he
 9
 dashahra bhagwaan ram or mata durga donon kaa mahatv darshata he
 In order to defeat Ravana, Shri Rama worshiped Maa Durga and as a blessing, the mother had revealed the secret of killing Ravana
 10
 Another belief is that on the day of Dussehra, King Ashoka adopted Buddhism
 isi din dow
 Ambedkar too adopted Buddhism
 aaj 31 disambar he or aapke paas iphone kii bydaree saste main kharidne kaa mauka he
 If you want to replace the battery of the old iphone, you can get it for just Rs 2,000
 1 janvari ke baad se aapaki yahi bydaree badalawaane ke liye shaayad 6,500 rupee yaa isse zyada dena pad saktaa he
 Actually, Apple had announced to make the battery of old iphone cheap long ago and its last date is 31 December 2018

 Till now, the talk of the ages is the autobiography of the famous Hindi story writer Mithileshwar
 isamen solah upaakhyaan hai
 Every anecdote read like a dense novelist
 lekin samagrata main phir bhi apurna, gandhi ke satya ke prayog kii tarah
 Gandhi was a great prose
 unhen vaachik style kaa acha abhyaas tha
 In addition to being a story writer, Mithileshwar is also a teacher of Hindi
 unki aatmakatha main donon dakhal dete hai
 Although self-immolation is less
 apni pratibha or uplabdhiyon ko lekar ve abhibhoot nahin hai par ummid jagaate hai
 Somewhere the writer is used, somewhere the professor
 gadhe samay main sankatmochan kii tarah
 Mithileshwar is a spontaneous anecdote of Premchand's tradition
 ve yathartwaadee hai or unki kahaniyon ke pramukh paatr or ghatnaayen renu ke aakhyaanon main aae paatro or ghatnaon kii tarah hi vaastavik hai
 a secret of his popularity is also that his stories were published in Dharmyuga, Sarika etc
 isse unhen badi sankhya main pathak mili, puraskaar bhi
 He never had a shortage of publishers
 phir bhi jivicoparjan ke liye mithileshwar ko hindi kaa praadhyaapak bananaa padaa
 First in Ranchi University, then in Magadha, later his college became Veer Kunwar Singh University
 lekhak hone ke gumaan yaa swabhimaan ne unhen vishistataa kii vyaadhi se bachaa liya
 In this book, he has not written about himself in as much detail, about his works
 isse un par research karne waalon ko sahyog hoga
 The decline in education sector is a reflection of the decline of other sectors of society
 raajnneeti ne kisi ko nahin bakhsha
 Along with being a writer and teacher, Mithileshwar is also the father of four daughters
 is rup main bhi unka harsh-vishaad varnit he
 There are themes of education, initiation and marriage etc
 of daughters
 saamaajik buraaiyon par bina kisi uttejnaa ke likhte hai mithileshwar
 School education system is exposed in the context of wife Renu's job
 transfar or posting ke niraale khel, dallalon kii bhoomika
 We know from this autobiography how difficult national level writing is by living in remote towns and villages
 mithileshwar karmyogi hai, isliye akele nahin hue
 The role of the mother, including family, is paramount
 shuruyaat hui he ranchi main adhyaaapak jivan se or samaapan hua he maa ke chita-bhasma main parinat ho jane main
 This is a sad narrative, not much opportunity for the reader to recover from depression
 isamen shiksha, chikitsa or saamaajik sandarbh bina kisi uttejnaa ke aalochay hue hai
 One incident calls attention separately to the looting of the writer
 rail ho yaa parivahan, andhere main lut machi he
 Mithileshwar has a unique experience of plundering in his own region
 lekin aise vyakti bhi hai, jo aapadaa main aage aate hai, bachaate hai
 Stories come in handy, teaching done in a healthy way is useful
 is aatmakatha main aatm kaa antahkaran jaise-jaise or jahaan-jahaan failata-phulataa he, katha-gati manthar, ati manthar hoti he
 But the language remains comfortable
 isamen yatre aadi prayog sthaneey lagate hai
 The entire structure is as cursed as to be subject to depression, as if the contents of Kafka have the purpose of giving Indian rites
 jivan ke jari rahane ke khandit drishyalekhon ke baavjood mithileshwar pathakon ko thakaate bhi khub hai

 darjeeling sahit pashchim bengal ke chaay bagan mazdooron kii haalat pehle se hi kharaab thi or notebandi ne unki rahi sahi qamar bhi tod di he
 The condition has become such for these laborers that many of them are forced to fill their stomachs with flowers and leaves in order to stay alive
 chaay bagan mazdooron ko november se nunatam bhatte bhi nahin mil paa rahe hai
 Darjeeling district of West Bengal has 68 tea estates
 inamen se 38 baganon ne 8 november ko notebandi shuru hone ke baad se apane mazdooron ko sirf ek hafte kaa bhatta diya he
 The condition of tea plantation laborers in Alipurduar, another tea growing district of West Bengal, is similar to that of the workers eating tea flowers
 ghar main rashan kii killat se jujh rahe in mazdooron ke paas jaruri saamaan kharidne tak ke liye paisa nahin
 One such laborer, Kalyani Goppe says- 'now our gardens are not doing well, we are not even able to buy vegetables, nor have anything to eat
 bachche chaay pattee ke kuch phool le aate hai, ham unheen ko pakaa kar kha rahe hai
 Kalyani is not the only one struggling with these problems after demonetisation
 nakadi kii killat kii vajah se mazdooron or unke pariwaron ko khaane laayak jo saamaan bhi mil rahaa he, usee se guzaara karnaa pad rahaa he
 In the absence of nutritious elements, now they have also faced health related problems
 chaay bagan main kaam karne vaale martha naag kehete hai, 'phulon ko khaakar aadha pet hi bharta he, lekin hamaare saamne koi doosraa vikalp bhi nahin
 Due to lack of essential nutritional elements, there is weakness and it is also difficult to work

 Sancharia Oraona, a tea garden laborer and mother of two children, says- 'many people have left the tea garden and are moving to another place in search of work
 mere apane parivaar ke log chale gaye hai
 My young son also had to leave due to sudden need of money
 chaay bagan main paise kab milenge, iskaa koi thikaana nahin
 'nearly 3 of the tea gardens in North Bengal
 5 lakh mazdooron ko nakadi main mehtaanaa miltaa he
 Their daily average is 132
 50 rupee hoti he
 Tea plantations usually pay workers a week or fortnight
 notebandi ke baad nakadi kii killat kii vajah se chaay baganon ko bich main hi apana kaam band karnaa padaa
 In the absence of laborers, some tea planters have also stopped work and gone to Dasuri place
 nagdi kii killat se kai bagan main kaam bandasilligudi main cash ke abhaav main tirahaana chaay bagan ke maalik or manager bhaag gaye
 The management of the plantation was unable to pay the workers their payment
 is bagan ko ilaake ke sabase bade baganon main se ek mana jaataa he or iske band hone se kareeb 2000 mazdooron kaa rojgaar chalaa gaya he
 These tea gardens located near Bagdogra 10 every year
 5 lakh kilo chaay kaa utpaadan karata tha, lekin pichley 15 din se yahaan chaay kaa utpaadan bhi band padaa tha
 Tea plantation worker Bir Bahadur Thapa says - 'even after working 8 to 16 hours day and night, we are not getting our wages
 koi jawaab dene vaala nahin ki hamen apana mehtaanaa kab milegaa
 We all have children, for whose education we need money
 hamen khaane-pine ke liye bhi paison kaa intjaam karnaa baari pad rahaa he
 Even after working day and night, the tea planters are not paying attention to our problems
 hamaare paas dawa or khaane kaa saamaan kharidne ke liye bhi paise nahin hai
 'politics in the midst of the sufferings of the workers is also very high, where the condition of the tea plantation workers is very worrying, while the politics is not deterred from doing its work
 trinmul congress ke netaa party supremeo mamata banerjee kii tarj par centre sarkaar par assam ko tarjeeh dete hue pashchim bengal ke chaay utpaadak kshetron se bhedbhaav kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 a local INTTUC leader said, 'tirhana tea plantation is entirely the responsibility of management, it is not the responsibility of the central government or TMC
 lekin kuch had tak modi sarkaar ko is haalat ke liye dosha diya ja saktaa he
 Because this situation has arisen after the central government's decision on demonetisation
 unhen (mazdooron) ko pichley 5 hafte se bhugtan nahin mila
 This is the reason that all the tea plantations are going on the labor movement
 chaay bagan ke maalik or manager bina koi bhanak die bhaage hue hai
 There is no fault of the government
 hamane party netaaon ko is bare main bataa diya he, unhone chaay bagan mazdooron ko nyaay dilaane kaa vaada kiya he
 Also assured that the tea gardens will start functioning again soon

 Ahluwalia had then promised a good day for Gorkhaland and tea garden laborers, but even after two and a half years, there was no change in the condition of tea garden laborers
 vahiin, trinmul congress kii koshish gorkha janamukti morcha ke netaaon main foot daal kar apane hit saadhane kii rahi he
 No party is serious in solving the problems of tea plantation laborers and daily laborers are getting killed the most
 assam main chaay baganon kii bhi halaat kharabati-board kii ore se karaae gaye besaline survey ke mutabik, assam main 750 chaay bagan hai, jahaan 65,000 se zyada majdoor kaam karte hai
 At the same time 30,000 workers are working in 300 tea gardens in West Bengal
 assam ke chaay baganon ke mazdooron kii bhi haalat zyada acchhee nahin hai
 Along with demonetisation, a directive from the Assam government to tea gardens is also overshadowed
 rajya sarkaar ne mazdooron kaa bhugtan sidhe unke bank khaaton main bhejne ke liye nirdesh jari kar rakhaa he
 On the other hand, banks are expressing inability to pay the laborers citing shortage of cash
 tii-board of india ke sutron ke mutabik, ausatan ek chaay bagan ko har hafte mazdooron ko bhugtan ke liye 10 lakh rupee kii har hafte jarurat hoti he
 Most tea plantation workers in Assam's Tinsukia district are illiterate
 ve atm kaa istemaal karne ko mushkil maanate hai
 Therefore they prefer to take payment in cash only

 newjiland ke khilaaf teen test maichon kii shrinkhalaa se pehle bharat apane chir pratidwandvi se keval ek ank peeche tha or shrinkhalaa jeetne par vah pakistan se aage ho jayega
 Nayakarvichandran Ashwin, who won in Kanpur against New Zealand, has moved up one place to second in the ICC Test rankings for all bowlers
 aswin ne match main 225 ran dekar das wicket liye the jisase bharat yah match 197 ran se jeetne main safal rahaa tha
 He has left behind England fast bowler James Anderson
 vah ab anderson se ek ank kii badhat par hai
 Ashwin is seven points ahead of South Africa's Dale Steyn at the top of the bowlers' rankings
 sten ke 878 ank hai
 After performing well in Kolkata, Ashwin can top the bowling list for the second time
 vah isse pehle pichley saal baxing de test match ke baad number ek gendbaaj bane the
 Apart from Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja is the second Indian bowler to feature in the top ten
 vah ek paaydaan upar saatven sthaan par pahunch gayi hai
 New Zealand's Mitchell Santner has moved up 12 places to 47th
 williamson ke 879 ank hai or unhen smith se aage nikalne ke liye agle dotest maichonmen behtareen ballebaaji kaa najaara pesh karnaa hoga
 Ashwin contributed 40 runs in India's first innings and this strengthened his top spot in the all-rounders' list
 aswin ne apane kariyar kii sarvshereshth reating 450 hasil kii he
 There is now a difference of 66 points between him and second-placed Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan
 williamson ko chhodkaranujilandke kisi anya ballebaaj ko ranking main khaas phayda nahin hua lekin bharat kii taraf se salaami ballebaaj murali vijay or cheteshwar pujaara aage badhane main safal rahe
 Vijay and Pujara became the first Indian pair to score a century partnership in both innings of the match in the last ten years

 bhartiya vayusena kii karrwai ke baad bhi balakot main aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad kaa training camp salaamat dikh rahaa he
 At the same time, politics is also taking place regarding the number of terrorists killed inside the country
 in sabake bich 'ajtak' ke khaas kaarykram 'suraksha sabha' main purv air chif marshall e vaai tipnis ne samajhaayaa ki kyon balakot main jaish kaa dhaancha salaamat dikh rahaa he
 AY Tipnis said that jaish-e-mohammed's training camp in Balakot is seen in the photo taken by the satellite
 lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki aatankiyon ko nuksaan nahin pahunchaa he
 The terrorists have suffered extensively
 kyonki ladaaku vimaan miraj-2000 ke jariye jo spice-2000 bam daage gaye wo sahi tagarat par jaakar laga he
 He said that the Israeli Spice-2000 bomb is very high-tech and that the bomb causes more damage to the inner cavity than the outer layer
 ye miraj-2000 ke special computer dwaara oparate kiya jaataa he
 Its strength can be gauged from the fact that it leads to the target by making a clue in a 10 feet thick wall
 isliye balakot main jaish kii building khadi dikh rahi he, lekin hakeekat main bam deevaaron main suraag karke andar tabaahi machaai he
 According to the former Air Chief, after reaching the target, no one can survive the Spice-2000 bomb
 isliye us din building ke andar main jo bhi hoga uskaa wo din aakhri din sabit hua hoga
 Now Jaish's whereabouts are seen standing in the picture, but by looking at the clues on his walls, the outcome can be estimated
 iske alaava unhone kaha ki vayusena main hameshaa sateek jaankaree ke baad hi tagarat tak pahunchane ke liye ranneeti banaai jaati he
 Therefore, it is clear that the house that was attacked was a terrorist training camp, but if the terrorists change their base a few hours before the attack, then they can escape
 kyonki aatanki hameshaa thikaane badalte rahete hai
 He said that if there had been 12 Rafael instead of 12 Mirage to take action on terrorist camps in Balakot, there would have been a panic in Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki aaj rafel kii sakht jarurat he
 And not one or two, but the entire 36 together needs the Air Force
