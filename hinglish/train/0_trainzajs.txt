 Even today, activists in West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are serving Bharat Mata by sacrificing their lives
 amit shah ne kaha ki sangharsh kaa parinaam he ki party safalataa ke shikhar par he, lekin ise safalataa kaa shikhar mat maniye
 Bengal, Kerala, Telangana and Tamil Nadu are yet to win, then the work of the Bharatiya Janata Party will end

 We have been fighting continuously since 1950
 aaj hamaare saamne jo party kaa swaroop he, yah hamaare liye saubhaahgya kii baat he
 Today, if we look at the map of India, then our booth workers have done the work of hoisting the flag of the BJP on the 70% land area of the country
 "shah ne chhattisgarh ke kaaryakartaaon or janata se apil karte hue kaha, "chauthi baar sarkaar banani he
 Raman Singh has to be made the chief minister and win with a thumping majority
 kaaryakarta ek lakshya lekar jaaen ki jab tak ham 65 siton ko paar naa kar le, hamen aaraam karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 "BJP President Amit Shah said while speaking on the excesses of Congress rule," Our workers were beaten in this Raipur city when Congress leader Ajit Jogi was the Chief Minister

 Former captain of the Indian cricket team, Sourav Ganguly, has defended Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul in the controversy
 ganguli ne pandya or rahul kii mahila virdohi tippanee ke sandarbh main chal rahe vivaad par kaha ki ‘hamen aage bad janaa chahie’ kyonki unhen bharosa he ki ye donon isse sikh lenge or behatar insaan banenge
 Ganguly said in Mumbai that he did not watch the episode of 'koffee with Karan', in which Pandya and Rahul's anti-women comments led to a temporary suspension
 lekin unhone in donon se sahanubhuti jataai
 Ganguly said about the controversy, 'people make mistakes, we should not move much further
 mujhe bharosa he ki jisane bhi yah kiya he, wo ise mahasoos karegaa or behatar insaan banegaa
 We are human beings, not machines that we will always be perfect
 hamen aage bad janaa chahie or sunishchit karnaa chahie ki aisa dobaaraa nahin ho
 Neither returning from Australia, picking up anyone's phone, nor leaving home, Hardik Pandyapandya and Rahul had to return in the midst of the current ODI series against Australia due to this suspension and Indian captain Virat Kohli had relations with many women
 The statement was termed as 'inappropriate'
 bisisiai ne tab se do baar unhen kaaran bataao notice bhej diya or unki jaanch bhi shuru kara di
 Asked whether he believes that the behavior of modern Indian cricketers is irresponsible compared to the earlier cricketers? Ganguly said that most of the cricketers are 'good people'
 unhone kaha, ‘ve (cricketer) kaaphi namr hote hai, kabhi kabhaar ek yaa do galtiyaan ho jaati hai, lekin main zyaadaatar ko vyaktigat rup se jaanata hum or ve mahaan khilaadi hai

 tippaniyan Dhoni publicly blamed the fielding abilities of the three players and said that these three are not being fed together as they are slow fielders with the team losing an extra 20 runs

 On the issue of demonetization, Congress leader p Chidambaram said that if anyone considers demonetisation to be the right step, then it is his wish and he can live in this happiness
 rahul kanwal ne poocha ki inakam tex department daawa kar rahaa he ki notembdi se tex chori par lagaam lagi he or ab tex ke jariye unki aay main ijapha hoga
 However, Chidambaram also called it an illusion of income tax department
 chidambaram kaa daawa he ki desh main blikemani cash main nahin rakhi jaati
 Chidambaram said that while announcing the demonetisation on 8 November, PM Modi said that black money will be completely eliminated with this one step
 chidambaram ne kaha ki pehle notebandi or phir jiesti ne desh main chote-majhole kaarobaari ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 According to Chidambaram, the biggest mistake of the Modi government was that it had declared demonetisation as the biggest weapon to eliminate black money
 vahiin benami sampatti par modi sarkaar kii taiyaari par chidambaram ne kaha ki ab dekhnaa he ki vah desh main kitni benami sampatti pakadakar kitne logon ko jail bhajane kaa kaam karte hai
 After demonetisation, there has been a big decline in the country's GDP
 haalanki chidambaram ne kaha ki yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki yah giravat sirf notebandi ke chalate hui he
 Chidambaram said that if BJP won the UP elections, they are considering it as a seal on demonetisation
 is hisaab se punjab main haar ke baad unhen maananaa chahie ki punjab main logon ne notebandi ko riject kar diya
 Therefore, Chidambaram said that the election of Gujarat is not meant to stamp the GST
 ise bhi padhein: congress kaa waar- notebandi main choti machhliyaan fansi, magaramchh nikalne main hue kaamyabjisti main mudda sirf itnaa he ki kendra sarkaar ne ise lagu karne main badi laaparvaahee barti or iske chalate deshbhar main kaarobaariyon ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 However, Chidambaram said that apart from GST in Gujarat, there are many issues which are taking people against BJP
 haalanki gujarat main antiinakambency ke chalate congress kii jeet tay he par chidambaram ne kaha ki rajya main congress acha kar rahi he
 So now the people of the state have to decide whom to mandate
 vahiin rahul gandhi ko gujarat main mil rahe respons par chidambaram ne kaha rahul kii spich or twit ko logon ne pasand karnaa shuru kiya he
 According to Chidambaram, social media no longer seems to be in favor of the ruling party and the opposition is strong
 lihaaja soshal media par saaf sanket he ki logon kaa man bijepi se bhar chukaa he
 Chidambaram claimed that many BJP leaders also now speak of the weakening of the BJP wave
 chidambaram ne kaha ki arthvyavastha main kai sector hai jinhen roj kaa kaam karne ke liye cash chahie
 There are many sectors where daily blackmoney is generated
 vahiin market main kai aise kaarobaar hai jahaan blikameni kii demand rahati he
 So Chidambaram claims that as long as there is a demand for black money in the market, black money will continue to be created in the economy
 bank acount ko aadhaar se jodne mahaj se banking vyavastha majboot nahin hoti
 According to Chidambaram, the Modi government is working beyond the mandate on the Aadhaar issue
 hamaari sarkaar ise mahaj sarkari skiimon ke phaayde se jodne ke liye rakhana chaahati thi jisase koi duplikeshan ko roka ja sake
 But the present government is now taking it ahead of the mandate of the Parliament
 chidambaram ne kaha ki aadhaar ko air tikat se jodne kii kya jarurat he
 With this step, after a time, the government will get information about where you went in 6 months

 The acceptance of this amount of rhetoric which has started with compensation, once again political turmoil has started, because the BJP is calling it the politics of vote bank, and the tradition of giving compensation again is wrong

 He looks at her searching within , that lost feeling , he is not himself 
 He feels it, yet denies it
 It surprises him
 Something fills him yet he feels empty too
 Staring at impending doom , he yearns to be torn again 
 Yet he doesn't make a move
 The world will end before he does 
 But he is unsure, cause he is not himself
 He is falling in love again

 On the remarks of senior BJP leader and MP Chandan Mitra of withdrawing Bharat Ratna from Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, who expressed his views of not seeing Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said that this is absolutely reflective of totalitarian thinking is
 yah bhartiya samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke pratikul he or isaki jitani ninda kii jaae kam he
 The comments patna main shuukravaar ko patrakaron se nitish ne kaha ki bharat ke samvidhan main logon ko apane vichaar prakat karne kii aazaadee he or aisa karne se koi roak nahin saktaa
 He said that if he is threatened to take Professor Amartya Sen's views on any subject, we will take back his Bharat Ratna, it is a symbol of totalitarian thinking
 nitish ne kaha ki aisa karnaa kisi ke liye sambhav nahin he
 One can raise confusion in the mind, but it is impossible to do so in this country
 unhone kaha ki samaveshi vikaas ke himachati or desh evam duniya main vidyaman garibi ke prati chintaa rakhane vaale dow amartya sen jaise mahaan arthshaastri ne agar koi vichaar vyakt kiye hai or us aadhaar par koi is duuri tak jaae or dhamkaae ki bharat ratna kii unhen jo oopaadhi di gai he, use chin liya jaae, iskaa unki party jediu ne kadaa virodh kiya he
 Nitish told reporters in Patna on Friday that in the Constitution of India, people have the freedom to express their views and nothing can stop them from doing so
 unhone kaha ki professor amartya sen ji ke kisi vishay par vichaar prakat karne ke liye agar unako dhamkaaya jaataa he ki ham unka bharat ratna waapas le lenge, yah adhinayakawadi soch kaa parichaayak he
 Nitish said that it is not possible for anyone to do so
 koi man main bhram paal saktaa he, lekin is desh main aisa karnaa naammumkin he
 He said that if a great economist like Dr
 Amartya Sen, who advocates for inclusive development and is concerned about the prevailing poverty in the country and the world, has expressed any idea and on that basis, one can go to this distance and threaten that the title of Bharat Ratna should be given to him
 It has been given, it should be taken away, it has been strongly opposed by his party JDU
 nitish ne kaha ki aisa karnaa kisi ke liye sambhav nahin he
 One can raise confusion in the mind, but it is impossible to do so in this country
 unhone kaha ki samaveshi vikaas ke himachati or desh evam duniya main vidyaman garibi ke prati chintaa rakhane vaale dow amartya sen jaise mahaan arthshaastri ne agar koi vichaar vyakt kiye hai or us aadhaar par koi is duuri tak jaae or dhamkaae ki bharat ratna kii unhen jo oopaadhi di gai he, use chin liya jaae, iskaa unki party jediu ne kadaa virodh kiya he

 The Speaker's opposition to the Congress has been termed as 'murder of democracy' but according to Gogoi, the reason behind not doing the work of Parliament is not the opposition, but the government

 mumbai kii femes radio jocky aaraje malishka bhi ab biemasi ke notice kaa shikaar ban gai hai
 The BMC investigated rj's house where he found the dengue larvae
 isi baat ko lekar malishka ko notice diya gaya he
 But questions are being raised on the Shiv Sena, the party that rules the BMC, on the timing of this notice
 BMC apni ore se safai de rahi he ki notice dene vaala ofishal jaanata hi nahin tha ki vahaan koun rahata he or yah routine checking kaa hi maamla he
 However, Shiv Sena wants to file a 500-million human-loss case against Malishka and FM channel
 arshad varsi ke ghar par chalaa BMC kaa bulldozer, karaayaa tha avaidh nirmanek gane se shuru hua maamalamalishka ne haal hi main mumbai main sadakon ke gaddhon ko lekar biemasi par nishaanaa sadhate hue ek gaanaa banaaya tha
 BMC had to face a lot of criticism from this video and this video was passed to the Shiv Sena sitting on the BMC chair for the last 25 years
 har saal barish main sadakon par gaddhon kii bharmaar or usamen bhare pani se logon ko jeena mushkil ho jaataa he
 On this issue, Malishka had asked the people of Mumbai via video whether they did not trust the BMC
 video ko logon ne kaaphi pasand kiya tha
 Rishi Kapoor cut 6 trees for construction in the house, BMC sent notice; The case of dengue larvae picked up along with it
 Along with this case, BMC started the exercise to prevent dengue and monsoon diseases
 is lapete main aaraje malishka kaa ghar bhi aa gaya
 The notice under 381B has been issued in the name of Malishka's mother Lily Mendosa and for this, Malishka's family will have to pay a fine of between Rs 2000 and Rs 10,000
 shivasena thokegi 500 karod kaa daawahal hi main aaraje malishka ne mumbai kii sadakon kii kharaab haalat ko lekar ek video share kiya tha
 People liked it but Shiv Sena got angry at it
 saath hi shivasena ne BMC kamishnar ko 500 karod kaa manahani kaa cese privet radio channel ke khilaaf daayar karne ko kaha he
 It is being told that Shiv Sena, which has been running BMC for the last 25 years, has taken it as the corporation's insult
 party ke corporator kishori pendenakar kaa kahana he ki us video main shahar kii seva main 24 ghante lage rahane vaale karmchaariyon kaa apmaan kiya gaya he
 We will take action against the radio channel
 BJP ne kiya malishka ko saportbhajapa ke mumbai ke chif ashish celler ne ek twit ke jariye malishka ke prayaas kii saraahna kii thi
 He wrote that in such a way, Malishka should be praised for bringing forward the Mumbai problem
 isse pehle kapil ko noticewaise dekhne main aayaa he ki jo bhi BMC ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaata he, uske ghar notice pahunch jaataa he
 This has happened with Kapil Sharma earlier
 BMC bhale hi kahati he ki koi uske nishane par nahin he lekin uske ection kuch or hi kehete hai

" lekin raashtrapati ne faisla kiya he ki sangh sarkaar main sarkari adhikariyon or karmchaariyon dwaara kiye ja rahe tyaag ke tahat vah bhi sarkari khajaane main apane vetan kaa ek hissaa jamaa karaayenge
 Obama plans to cut checks for the exchequer on a monthly basis, which will be deemed effective from March 1, but he will cut the first check in April
 tippaniyan a day before, US Defense Minister Chuck Hagel announced a similar move
 seenetter mark begich ne bhi elaan kiya tha ki vah svaichhik rup se apane vetan kaa kuch hissaa sarkari khajaane main jamaa karaayenge tathaa unke staff ke aadhe se adhik sadasyon ne bhi isi prakaar kaa kadam uthaaya he
 The salary of the US President is four million dollars annually (more than two crore rupees) and he will return about 20 thousand dollars (more than 10 lakh rupees) to the government treasury to show solidarity with the countrymen
 white house ke press sachiv je kaarne ne bataaya, congress ke sadasyon ke saath raashtrapati kaa vetan kanoon dwaara tay kiya jaataa he or use badla nahin ja saktaa
 But the President has decided that he will also deposit a part of his salary in the government treasury as a sacrifice being made by the government officials and employees in the Union Government
 obama kii masik aadhaar par sarkari khajaane ke liye check kaatane kii yojana he, jo 1 march se prabhavi maani jaaegi, lekin vah pehla check april main kaatenge

 In the politics of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani and Nitin Patel are considered 'ram-lakhan' of Modi
 in donon netaaon ne shapath grahan se ek din pehle somvaar ko gujarat main bijepi ke pehle mukhyamantri rahe keshubhai patel se aashirwad liya
 However, after winning the 2012 assembly elections, Narendra Modi also went and fed sweets to Keshubhai Patel
 modi kii tarj par roopaani or nitin patel ke keshubhai ke paas jane ke peeche siyaasi myne chhipe hai
 Let it be said that this is the first time in 22 years that the BJP has got less than 100 seats in Gujarat
 bijepi ko rajya kii 182 siton main se 99 siten mili hai
 BJP has suffered the biggest blow in Saurashtra region
 saurashtra kshetra kii 54 siton main se bijepi ko 25 siten mili hai
 While the Congress has got 29 seats
 saurashtra bijepi kaa durg mana jaataa he
 When BJP first came to power in 1995, Tosaurashtra region won 44 seats
 iske baad se saurashtra bijepi kaa majboot garh mana jane laga
 Keshubhai Patel did the work of establishing the roots of BJP in Saurashtra
 1995 se lekar 2012 tak ye kshetra bijepi ke liye garh sabit hota rahaa he, lekin is baar congress is kile ko bhedane main kaaphi had tak safal rahi he
 The BJP seats from Saurashtra in 2017 are a matter of concern for the party
 aise menmodi ke 'ram-lakhan' maane janevaale vijay roopaani or nitin patel ne keshubhai ke dar par jaakar dastak di he
 Vijay Rupani has become an MLA from Rajkot in Saurashtra
 aise main unke kshetra main siten kam hone par unki chintaa laazmi he
 Especially when he is going to re-ascend the throne of the Chief Minister of the state as the successor of Narendra Modi
 vahiin nitin patel dobaaraa se dipti siem kii kaman sanbhaalenge
 BJP is trying to bring back the slain mass base in Saurashtra through Keshubhai Patel
 donon netaaon kii keshubhai se mulaakaat isi myne main nikaali ja rahi he
 By the way, Vijay Rupani went to Keshubhai Patel even before his nomination and took his blessings
 ab satta main vaapasi ke baad dobaaraa unke darbar main dastak di he
 The intention behind this is to improve Saurashtra's deteriorated political equation
 kyonki 18 maheene ke baad loksabhaa kaa chunaav he
 In such a situation, this step can also be understood towards removing the resentment of the Patels
 gujarat main aaj bhi keshubhai patel apane samudaay ke bhishma pitamah maane jate hai
 It is another matter that his political ambitions did not get much support from the society
 bollywood ke senior actor naanaa patekar par shooting ke dauraan budtamiji or chhedchhad kaa aarope lagane ke baad se puure maamle par bollywood samet deshbhar main charchaa he
 Referring to a 10-year-old case, Tanushree alleged, "nana Patekar wanted to forcibly get closer, he was not a part of the song during the shooting, though he tried to get intimate with him
" "apane upar lage sangeen aaropon par naanaa ne pehali baar riection diya he
 He denied the allegations and said, "what do they mean by sexual assaults? There were 50 to 100 people with me on the set
" main dekhtaa hum ki kanoonee rup se main kya kar saktaa hum
 "nana said this in Marathi from a channel
 tanushri-naanaa vivaad: bollywood chup, patrkaar kaa daawa- sach bol rahi hai actress, set par thi mantanushri ne naanaa patekar par jo aarope lagaae hai, us par salmaan khan ne bhi apana riection diya
 He said, "I am not aware of this matter
 mujhe jaanane or samajhane do ki kya hua he
 We will see what is happening
 is samay mujhe vaaki pataa nahin he ki aap kis bare main baat kar rahe hai
 "tanushree said that in such cases one should not go to one's image
 koi baahar acha actor ho saktaa he, lekin persenalee kairactor uskaa kaisaa he ye jaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Gurmeet Ramraheem and all the Babas were also worshiped, they were considered to be Gods, but see what was the reality later
 bal mundwanaa chaahati thim tanushri, phir pakad liya aadhyatm kaa raastatnushri datta ke naanaa patekar par sangeen aarope lagane ke baad koreographer ganesh acharya naanaa ke bachaav main aa gaye hai
 He was a part of the film, which has been mentioned by Tanushree
 ab actress ne acharya ke bayaan par kaha ki ve jhuthe or dogale hai
 Acharya got work in the film only because of me
 bataa den ki acharya ne tanushri kii is baat kaa khandan kiya ki ye solo song tha or naanaa isamen jabardasti aana chaahate the
 Acharya said that it was a dual song from the beginning
 naanaa iskaa hissaa the
 He said that Tanushree is misinformed that she got work in the film because of him
 unhone kaha, naanaa sweet person hai
 They cannot do this
 tanushri boleen- jhuthe or dogale hai ganesh acharya, maine unhen kaam dilaayaa thatanushri ne acharya ke bayaan par kaha, "ve jhuthe or do munhi baaten karne vaale insaan hai
 They got work because of me
 unhone mujhe baahar nikaalane kaa tay kar liya tha, isliye jaahir he ki ve naanaa kaa saport karenge
 They are equally involved in it ”

 piem narendra modi ne apane grih rajya main is shandaar jeet par janata kaa abhivadan kiya or is fatah ko asaamaanya bataaya
 In fact, after the overwhelming anger of the Patidars and the atmosphere created in favor of the Congress, this victory was described by PM Modi as unusual, and in many other ways, the election results are not normal for the BJP

 ab bijepi netaa sadhvi praachi ne kaha he ki unhone chaar bachche paidaa karne ko kaha tha, 35-40 pille paidaa karne ke liye nahin
 Prachi said this at the conference of Vishwa Hindu Parishad on Sunday
 praachi ne kisi samudaay vishesh kaa naam liye bina kaha, 'ye log jo 35-40 pille paidaa karte hai, phir lav jehad failaate hai
 Nobody talks on that
 lekin mere bayaan ke baad itnaa bavaal much gaya
 People told me that development of more children would stop development, but i stood by my statement
 ' praachi ne manch se elaan karte hue kaha ki agar kisi ke paas 5 se 10 bachche hai to wo mere paas aaen main unhen sammanit karuungi
 SP leader Shivpal Singh Yadav strongly condemned the statement of the SP leader on the SP leaders
 praachi ne manch se shivpal singh yadav ko pagal bataate hue kaha ki shivpal ko paagalakhaane bhej dena chahie
 Prachi said that i invite Azam Khan and Taufiq Raza to return home, the doors of Hindus are open for them

 In a post on his Facebook account, he has claimed that cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu will form a front named awaaz-e-punjab
 duusari ore, siddhu kii patni navjot cor ne kaha ki pargat ke daavon par siddhu aagaamee 8 sitambar ko media ke saamne apni raay rakhenge
 Navjot said, 'I saw the Facebook post of Pargat Singh

 The resentment between the party and Sidhu turned sour when he became vocal against the Punjab government led by Parkash Singh Badal

 In the 2014 general election, which was tried on the pretext of Rajya Sabha, when Arun Jaitley was given a ticket in place of Sidhu from Amritsar seat, these relations got bitter

 In the meantime, BJP had tried to satisfy Sidhu by giving him Rajya Sabha membership

 He had a big blast by resigning from the Rajya Sabha

 naukari dilaane ke naam par karata tha thagikuch dinon main thage kareeb paune do karod rupedilli police ne ek aise shaks ko giraftaar kiya he jo khud ko iees adhikari bataakar naukari dilaane kaa vaada karata tha or unase badi rakam thag letaa tha
 Police said that in the name of getting the job, the accused had cheated nearly twenty two crore rupees in a few days
 police philhal ye pataa lagane main lagi he ki aaropee ne ab tak kitne logon ko thag chukaa he
 According to police, Javed has a BA from Jawaharlal University in Delhi
 iske baad javed akhtar ne kuch dinon tak civil services kii taiyaari bhi kii lekin use safalataa nahin mil saki
 After which the accused started the business of cheating people
 thagi main kamaaye paune do karod rupepulice ke mutabikshaatir thagka naam javed akhtar he
 The accused used to tell the people that he is an IAS officer
 aaropee jahaan bhi jaataa tha wo apana cader duusare rajya kaa bataata tha or phir uske baad wo is tarah baatcheet karata tha ki kabhi kisi ko us par shaq nahin hota tha
 Not only this, he promised to get jobs by telling people his high reach
 iske baad agar koi isaki baat main funs jaataa to phir ye usase paison kii maang karata tha
 According to the police, till now they came to know that within a few days, Javed has taken about twenty five million rupees in the name of getting jobs from people
 jammu main bhi hai aaropee par do cese darjajankaree ke mutabik javed ke khilaaf do cese jammu main darj hai
 Apart from this, many complaints and cases are also registered against Javed in Delhi
 yahi nahin aligarh main bhi javed ke khilaaf kai cese darj hai
 In East Delhi's Laxmi Nagar, a person complained that a man who claimed himself to be an IAS officer, promised to get a job
 uske baad usne naukari dilaane ke naam par usne lakhon rupye le liye or baad main phone uthaanaa bhi band kar diya
 After this, the police registered a case in this case and started investigation and then arrested Javed Akhtar
 police kaa kahana he ki abhi is puure cese kii jaanch kii ja rahi he or duusare rajyon kii police se bhi baatcheet kii ja rahi he taaki ye pataa lagaaya ja sake ki javed ne ab tak kitne logon ko apni thagi kaa shikaar banaaya he
 You bastard dog, i will drink your blood
 dharmendra ke munh se is dialog ko nikle chaar dashak se zyada samay ho chukaa he lekin aaj bhi hindi cinema kaa yah sabase yaadgaar dialog bana hua he
 Think, if Dharmendra had to speak this dialogue today under the rule of Central Film Certification Board (CBFC) Chairman Pahlaj Nihalani
 yah kuch is tarah se hota, beep
 
 
 Beep
 
 
 main tera khun pi jaaoongaa
 Or something better would have happened, blind somewhere, i will drink your blood
 filmkaar shantnu raay kaa kuch aisa hi tajurba rahaa tha jab ve apni edlt kamedi film guddu kii gan ke liye sensor board se certificate lene gaye the
 He says, "just like writers keep sounding boards with them, we have to put a photo of Nihalani in our room now that they are looking down and saying," Don't write this
 ” engri indian godesses ke produsar gaurav dhingra ko film ke us dialog main “lunch” kii jagah bipakarna padaa jahaan mahila purush ko dekhakar kah rahi he, “lunch to saamne se aa rahaa he
 "butterfly's writer-director Kanu Bahl had to change or beep the soundtrack at least 44 locations throughout the film
 bahal khijhakar poochhate hai, “meri film ko agar “e” certificate de hi diya gaya he, to isse kya fark padataa he ki usamen 30 fisadi apshabd the yaa 50 fisadi
 “the relationship between the world's largest film industry and CBFC has been bitter in the past
 ise aap bachche or abhibhavak ke rishte kii tarah samaj sakate hai jisamen kathor pita apane bachche ke liye niyam banaata he jabaki bachche ko lagata he ki ye niyam puraane hai or uske pita ko samay ke saath khud ko badalanaa chahie
 Today, the film industry has a 65-year-old film producer Nihalani in the role of this stalwart father who has given hit films like Shola and Shabnam and Aankhen starring Govinda, and also croops like Dil Tera Deewana and bhai-bhai
 nihlani aajkal mumbai sthit sibiefasi ke mukhyalay bharat bhawan or khaar sthit apane us nijee karyaalay ke bich chakkar lagaate paae ja rahe hai jahaan filmon ke poster kii bajaae unki teble par devi-devataaon kii tasviren saji hui hai
 Nihalani is taking this honorary position so seriously that he can often be seen working on holidays
 unki taanashaah jaisi kaaryastylee kii shikaayat kar chuke board ke ek sadsy kehete hai, “ve sochate hai ki ve hi bharat kii samskruti or naitikta ke sangrakshak hai
 "as far as Nihalani is concerned, he might have seen himself as a superhero and like Spiderman would believe that" with great power there are huge responsibilities
 ” fark bas itnaa he ki ve jis cheez ko jimmedaar maanate hai, use baaki filmkaar damankaaree or pratibandhaatmak maanate hai
 Since his appointment to the post in January, it seems that CBFC is imposing some value on its audience
 kya sweekaarya he or kya nahin, is maamle main board aksar aise faisle le rahaa he jo ajeebogareeb hai
 Instead of the Certification Board, he has come in the role of a much more cultured board, which has embarked on its own Clean India campaign
 nihlani ko saal bhar bhi nahin hua he lekin unke shikaron kii fehrist kaaphi lambii ho gai he or lagaataar badhati hi ja rahi he
 Milap Jhaveri, the director of the film, which is cleared after 500 cuts like Mastizaade, refrains from making any comments and sends only "cheers" in response
 sachaai yah he ki produsar, diarector or distribyootors kaa mood utana khushnuma nahin he, bhale hi inamen se kuch log apane anubhav baantne se batch rahe hon
 Some of them were surprised that they were facing a board that believed that the audience's defense was reduced by just 20 seconds (as recently done with the James Bond film Spector)
 can be done
 puure desh ke maahaul ko dekhte hue kuch log kah sakate hai ki nihlani or unka board apana kaam kar rahaa he&yani ashishnutaa barat rahaa he
 Atul Sabharwal, the director of the film Aurangzeb, was asked to cut a scene from his documentary In Their Shoes which showed the child working in the leather factory in Agra
 sachaai kadavi hoti he, to kya ham usase ankhen moond len? sabharwal poochhate hai, “aage kya hoga? kya ve svachh bharat abhiyaan kii vajah se kooda-kachra dikhaane vaale drishyon ko bhi pratibandhit kar denge?”bollywood kaa nayaa donamir khan ne dilli main 23 november ko film industry kii chintaaon ko kuch is tarah rekhaankit kiya, “meri koi bhi film sensorship ke liye lambey samay se nahin gai he isliye meraa koi nijee anubhav to nahin he
 As far as i understand, the board has become more aggressive in the last six to eight months which is worrying for me
 ” khan khushkismat hai kyonki agar nihlani kaa kaarykaal hota to unki film dely beli anek cat or beep ke bagaiyr cinemahol tak pahunch hi nahin paati
 Today, words like harami, sala and pornographer are banned
 kajariya kii diarector madhurita anand apane kalakaaron kaa shukriya adaa karti hai ki 4 disambar ko relies ho rahi unki film pichley saal hi board se paas ho gai
 He is aware that if his film, centered on female feticide in Haryana, would have been a problem for him if he had gone before the current board
 nihlani kaa ativaadee ravaiya is baat ko sabit karata he ki sensorship apane aap main ek aadim cheez ho chuki he
 Filmmaker and former CBFC member Amit Khanna says, "they have no perspective on beauty, which is the core of any certification policy
" ” march main jab nihlani ko apane pad par aae sirf teen maheene hue the, tab kai filmkaaron ne soochna or prasaaran rajyamantri rajyavardhan singh rathod se mulaakaat kar ke apni chintaa se unhen avgat karaayaa tha
 Nihalani, who is facing accusations of dictatorial attitude, arbitrariness in certification and preparing a list of banned words, does not matter
 ve kehete hai, “main sibiefasi ke disha-nirdeshon ke mutabik kaam kar rahaa hum or jab tak ye disha-nirdesh badalte nahin, main aise hi kaam karata rahoonga
 Rathore had to reassure the film industry at the recent International Film Festival of India in Goa, in view of questions arising over the functioning of the current board, "the main role of CBFC is to give certificates and not censorship
" ”vakt kii pukaar he sudharbite 64 varshon ke dauraan aksar is baat ko kaha gaya he lekin sansthaaon ne ise ansuna kar diya
 CBFC is a regulatory body whose job is to give films U, u / A, a and in some rare situations an s (special) rating which depends on the content of the film
 nihlani kaa bachaav karte hue paraamarsh panel ke ek sadsy kehete hai ki ve darasal disha-nirdeshon kaa hi paalan kar rahe hai jinamein apshabdon kii chhot nahin he
 During the process of certifying, board members have to identify scenes that insult women, avoid scenes of violence, vandalism and terror and identify scenes that may be a threat to the country 
 samasya is baat se paidaa hoti he ki cinemetograph kanoon, 1952 ke tahat filmon ke pramann ke liye aakhri disha-nirdesh 1991 main jari kiye gaye the
 Nandini Sardesai, a board member and sociologist, says, "these guidelines are not only irrelevant but also unnecessary
 pichley 25 varshon main duniya naatakeey tareeke se badali he
 "in Goa, Rathore said," We are working on the new cinematograph law
 is kanoon main sanshodhan kaa ek masauda justise mudgal cameti kii ore se aayaa he
 We will put it in the public domain or hand it over to experts for suggestions
 ”ek tha tiger or bajrangi bhaijan ke diarector kabir khan kehete hai, “adarsh sthiti yah he ki darshak theatre tak aaen or tay karen ki unhen kya dekhnaa he
 “we are far from ideal, so many filmmakers including Khan and Madhur Bhandarkar believe that we must have regulatory bodies
 bhandarkar kaa board ke saath purana jhagada rahaa he chunki unki filmon fishan, heroin or dil to baccha he ji ko shey certificate mila tha
 He says, "there is a need for scale and a minimum discipline should be maintained, but the intention and reference of the filmmaker must also be seen
 ”sibiefasi kaa ek disha-nirdesh yah bhi he ki “kalatmak abhivyakti or rachanaatmak swatantraaa ko anaavashyak rup se baadhit na kiya jaae
 Bhandarkar believes that in the current environment, filmmakers should impose restrictions on themselves
 ve kehete hai, “ham itane najuk samay main ji rahe hai jahaan log badi aasaani se aahat ho jate hai
 Then it is said that we do not restrict ourselves
 main to itnaa hataash hum ki soch rahaa hum, cartoon filmein bananaa shuru kar duun
 The producer also has additional pressure on the director who needs a u or u / a certificate as satellite rights are at stake
 “e” reating vaali film ko tivi par dikhaane se pehle dobaaraa certificate lenaa hota he jiske myne yah hue ki usamen or zyada cat lag sakate hai
 Its example is Grand Masti, which was 135 minutes on the big screen, while on the small screen, its duration is just 98 minutes
 bhandarkar kehete hai, “is faisle ko sweekaar karne ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin he
 "there is definitely something wrong with CBFC," says a member of the public outrage board
 nihalaani lagaataar dakhal dete rahete hai, bal kii khaal nikaalte hai or apane adhikaar kshetra kaa ulanghan karte hai
 "it has been found that he sits with the revising committee during the film's performance, while this is not his job as the board members' strength is sufficient for this work
" board ke sadsy kehete hai, “ek apratyaksh dabaav bana rahata he
 How can board members be able to speak while in their room? ”some board members are so upset with Nihalani's dictatorial attitude that they have vented their anger on public forums
 ashok pandit ne twitor par nihlani kii kaaryastylee par hamalaa kiya or bheetar kaa asantosh is tarah baahar aa gaya
 Pandits, who usually stand in the line of right-wingers, say, "there should be freedom
" har aadmi ramayana yaa mahabharat nahin banayega
 Ever since i became a member, only one or two short films certificates have been given to me
 unhone sara kaam akele apane haathon main le liya he
 Members like retired IAS and former Secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Raghu Menon have been associated with CBFC for over two decades
 ab ve darkinar ho gaye hai
 In a mail to board members, Nihalani and CEO Anurag Srivastava, in November, he said that he was hurt by the "reckless and reckless" treatment of board members under Nihalani's rule
 ve likhte hai, “maine kabhi bhi kisi mantralay kii ore se aisi ahm swytt sanstha ke prati samvedanheenata or upeksha nahin dekhi jise sansad ke paarit ek kanoon ke tahat sthapit kiya gaya ho
 
 
 If this board is so irrelevant, it should be dissolved
 ”isamen koi aashcharya nahin he ki nihlani unheen sadasyon ko tarjeeh dete hai jo unki haa main haa milaate hai
 The rest has been sidelined
 filmkaar chandraprakash dvivedi bhi march main asahmat logon kii suchi main shaamil ho gaye jab unhone yah patr likhaa, “ek aisi pratishthit sanstha kaa hissaa rahete hue main ab asahaj mahasoos karne laga hum jahaan board kaa samuhik nirnay yaa samuhik swar ko suna nahin jaataa
 The board meeting in July at the famous hotel Sun Ain Sand in Juhu, once the first choice of filmmakers of a generation, said that the notorious list of abusive names was being withdrawn
 kai filmkaaron kaa kahana he ki kshetreey karyaalay ab bhi pramann kii prakriya main is suchi kaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 One filmmaker says, "we were told not to go by media reports
" vah ab bhi lagu he
 "at the same meeting, Nihalani declared Sardesai to be" open-minded "because of his work during the tenures of Sharmila Tagore and Leela Samson
 sitambar main saradesai ne iees adhikari or siio anuraag shrivastav se mumbai main mulaakaat kii or unase board kii baithak bulawaane ko kaha jahaan sari shikayaton ko suna ja sake or ahm nitigat faislon par charchaa ho sake
 No such meeting has been called till now
 sibiefasi ke board kii saal main chaar baithken honi tay hai
 Nihalani, who is completing his first year in office in January, has held only two meetings
 saradesai kahati hai, “asantosh failaa hua he lekin isamen kisi kii dilchaspee nahin he
 CBFC is not an institution separate from politics
 soochna or prasaaran mantralay teen saal ke kaarykaal ke liye sibiefasi ke sadasyon ko tathaa nau kshetreey karyaalayon main paraamarsh panel ke sadasyon ko do saal ke liye niyukt karata he
 Often such members are invariably elected who are not opposed to the ruling party, even if they are not full supporters
 is baat main beshak sachaai ho sakati he ki nihlani ko yah pad “har har modi” ke liye mila he lekin tab nihlani ke samarthak kah sakate hai ki lila samson ko yah pad isliye mila tha kyonki ve priyanka gandhi kii bharatnatyam teacher rah chuki thim
 Anupam Kher is considered a loyalist of the BJP
 upie kii pehali sarkaar aate hi unhen hataa diya gaya tha
 If there are allegations on Nihalani today, then Sharmila Tagore was also accused at that time of being very soft in the case of Vishal Bhardwaj's film Omkara because his son Saif Ali Khan was working in it
 board ne hameshaa hi khud sarkaar ke nirdeshon or film industry kii maang ke bich fansaa paaya he
 In some cases it has favored the industry, such as films like Delhi Bailey and Grand Masti
 isse alag haalanki aise maamle bhi hai jahaan yah saaf hota he ki rajnatik sanghathanon ko bhi naakhush nahin kiya ja saktaa, jaisaa 2013 ke dangon par kendrit documentry film in dinon mujffarnagar ke saath kiya gaya
 Anupam Kher was the chairman of the CBFC board for a year during which he passed Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday, Rakesh Sharma's Gujarat Riots film Final Solution and Mel Gibson's film The Passion of the Christ
 ve kehete hai, “aap jitna zyada dabaanaa chahenge, aag utani hi zyada failegi
 You have to be wise to understand the guidelines or else there are such rules that any film can be banned with their help
 vishwa cinema or sahitya ke bare main chairman kii shiksha or jaagrukta kaa equitahaan yaheen par hota he
 “film certification will remain
 yah kahin nahin jane vaala
 Kabir Khan says, "we need more ratings
 ” unka maananaa he ki aaj chunki filmon kaa dayera kahin zyada vyapak he isliye maujuuda pranali use sambhaal nahin paa rahi he
 This may be a solution, of course, but it is also possible with changes within the CBFC, which are difficult to happen
 ek hi tarika he ki filmkaar philhal is tantra se ladgaye ke anuthe tareeke khoj nikaalen
 Bollywood emperor Amitabh Bachchan is very pleased and impressed with singer Micah Singh, who has sung the song 'kammo' for him in the film 'department'
 tippaniyan On his blog Amitabh wrote, "micah, who gave voice to many popular songs in the film industry, sang 'kammo' in 'department' for me

 rithik roshan ke khilaaf ek or nayaa legal notice jari kiya gaya he or is baar legal notice ke peeche kangana nahin balki chrishchiyan community he
 In order to hurt his religious sentiments, the Christian community leader has been sent a legal notice asking him to apologize on the tweet made to the pope
 notice main is baat kaa zikr kiya gaya he kipope ke bare main twitakar rithik ne chrishchiyan community kii bhaawanaaon ko aahat kiya he
 Abraham Mathai, President of Indian Christian Voice, sent the notice on 28 March
 haalanki ek tivi news channel main rithik ke vakil ne kaha he ki philhal unhen is tarah kaa koi notice nahin mila he lekin agar kisi kii dharmik bhavanaaen aahat huin hai to rithik iske liye maafee maangane ko taiyaar hai
 In this tweet made on 28 January, Hrithik wrote, 'there can be more chances of the Pope's affair with me than the amazing women whose name is being added to me by the media
 thanks lekin no thanks'
 The special thing in this case is that this notice has been sent by Rizwan Siddiqui on behalf of Matitik and Rizwan is the same lawyer who is fighting on behalf of Kangana in joritik-kangnaki Legal War
 isliye ab is baat kii khub charchaa he ki jab rithik ne twit 28 janvari ko twit kiya tha to itane maheene baad hi kyon notice jari kiya gaya pehle hi kyun nahin kadam uthaaya gaya
 Is this bet too from Kangana? karnataka main sarkaar gathan ko lekar chal rahe ghamaasan ke bich congress ne louh ayask ke avaidh khanan main abhiyukt janardan reddy kaa ek audio clip jari kiya he, jisamen unhen ek congress vidhayak ko bijepi main shaamil hone kaa laalach dete hue suna ja saktaa he
 The Congress claims that in the audio clip, Reddy is talking to Congress MLA from Raichur Rural, Basan Gowda Daddal
 is clip main shaamil shaks ko kehete hue suna ja saktaa he- tum puraani baaten bhul jaao
 Today, your good days will start from midnight
 rashtriya adhyaksh tum se sidhe baat karenge
 Read their entire conversation - Janardhana Reddy-free? Congress MLA Basan Gowda Daddal - Yes, i am free Hareddy-please forget the old things, understand that there was a bad time
 meraa bharosa karo ki aaj raat se tumhaara samay badal jayega
 We will talk directly to the national president of our party
 hamen bataao ki tumhen koun sa pad chahie
 We can talk among ourselves and then the talk will move forward
 congressividhayak-nahin sar, unhone meraa us samay saath diya, jab meraa kharaab samay chal rahaa tha
 Reddy: Let me tell you that things were not right at the time of BSR
 shriramulu ne party bana lee thi
 There is no doubting that all of you people were hurt by this main tumse kah rahaa hum ki tum sau guna se bhi zyada tarakkee karoge
 Then Shivan Gowda became a minister at my behest and today his position is quite good
 ye sab meri vajah se hua
 Your luck is bad that we did not meet you in your bad times
 aaj tum mantri ban sakate ho
 i can talk to your elder people directly
 ve apane baton se nahin palatate hai
 They are running the country
 jitna bhi tumne kamaaya he, uskaa sau guna kama sakate ho
 Congress mla-sorry sir
 unhone aakhri samay main mujhe liya or tikat diya
 i do not feel right to cheat on them at such a time

 The Governor gave 15 days extension to the new government to prove majority, which was reduced by the Supreme Court till Saturday
 aise main congress kaa aarope he ki bijepi ne bahumat sabit karne ke liye jodtod shuru kar diya he
 The Congress has released the audio clip by the filthy politician, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar termed it as dirty politics
 unhone kaha, main congress ke is kadam kii aalochana karata hum
 Analytica closed due to such works, but the Congress' dirty-working department has not closed
 jab se congress haar rahi he tabhi se usne gandi raajnneeti kerani shuru kar di he
 (note- Above is the transcription of the Congress-issued audio
 audio congress party kii ore se relies kiya gaya he

 104-year-old Fauja Singh is perhaps the oldest runner in the world
 kuch saal pehle fauja ji ne marathon main daudna chhod diya, lekin duniya bhar ke dhavakon ke liye wo prerana hai, is umr main daudane ke liye fauja ji kaa suzav aasaan he
 The comments enditivi se khaas baatcheet main fauja singh ne kaha, 'meri diet badi khaas he, khush raho
 After this he said with a long smile, 'I am a vegetarian, it is very cold where i live in London, so i eat pulses, rotis and green vegetables, i like bitter gourd
 ' bivi-bete kii maut ke baad 89 saal kii umr main fauja singh ne daudna shuru kiya, punjab se landan jaakar bas gayi, lekin aaj bhi hindustan lautate hai to waapas jane kaa dil nahin karata
 On the occasion of Mumbai Marathon, he told NDTV, 'whenever i return, i miss my village, my friends, it feels great to come back here
 ' 104 saal kii umr main fauja singh, josh-jazbe se bhare hue hai
 In 2011, Fauja was considered the oldest marathon runner by participating in the Toronto Marathon, but his name was not recorded in the Guinness Book because he does not have a birth certificate
 2000 se marathon daud rahe fauja singh ne aakiri baar 2013 main hongcong marathon main peshewar tareeke se bhaag liya tha
 In a special conversation with NDTV, Fauja Singh said, 'my diet is very special, be happy
 ' iske baad ek lambii muskuraahat ke saath unhone kaha, 'main shaakaahaari hum, landan main jahaan rahata hum vahaan bahut thand padati he, isliye daalen, rotiyaan or hari sabzi khaataa hum, karela mujhe bahut pasand he
 After the death of his wife and son, at the age of 89, Fauja Singh started running, settled in London from Punjab, but even today, if he returns to India, he does not want to go back
 mumbai marathon ke maukey par enditivi se unhone kaha, 'jab bhi waapas lautataa hum to meraa gaanv, mere yaar mujhe yaad aate hai, yahaan waapas lautakar bahut acha lagata he
 'fauja Singh, at the age of 104, is full of passion
 2011 main toronto marathon main hissaa lekar fauja ji sabase umradraj marathon dhaavak maane gayi, lekin ginis book main unka naam darj nahin hua kyonki unke paas janm pramaan patr nahin he
 Fauja Singh, who has been running a marathon since 2000, last competed in the 2013 Hong Kong Marathon professionally

 piem modi ko 'neech' kehane vaale bayaan ko ek website main lekh likhakar usko sahi tehraane ke maamle main congress netaa manishankar ayyarne kaha he ki ek line lekar isamen mujhase sawaal poocha ja rahaa he
 He said, 'I am not going to get stuck in this game, i am an owl, but not such a big owl'
 ayyar ne kaha 'main hameshaa se media kaa peedit rahaa hum or isane meraa bahut nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 i will not give any clarification on this, i am told that an official statement has been made by the party
 news agency eenai se baatcheet main kaha ki jab vah 6 saal ke the to pradhanmantri nehru desh ke pradhanmantri bane the or jab 23 saal ke hue to unka nidhan ho gaya
 Iyer said, 'I have learned politics at this time
 aaj is sarkaar ne jo maahaul banaaya he uski tulana nehru kaal se nahin ho sakati he
 Let me tell you that in an article written in the English website, senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar has increased the heat once again by justifying his statement that two years ago was vile to PM Modi
 apane lekh main manishankar ne rajeev gandhi or balakot air strike par piem modi ke bayaan kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki do saal pehle unhone apni tippanee main bhavishyavaanee kii thi
 However, after the controversy, Iyer apologized, calling it his poor Hindi lapse
 # WATCH Mani Shankar Aiyar, Congress: Statement has come from my side, there is a whole article, picking out one line from it and saying "now talk on this"
 I'm not ready to be involved in your games, 'main ullu hoon, lekin itna bada ullu nahi hoon'

 It was being speculated that the BJP retaliated by saying that the double character and arrogance of the Congress has come to the fore again and it should answer it
 grih mantri rajnath singh ne bijepi mukhyalay main samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki manishankar ayyar ne jo kaha he vah ek website par lekh main kaha he, us par congress kaa kya kahana he ? chunaav prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan bhashaa maryaada ke ulanghan par ek sawaal ke jawaab main singh ne kaha ki yah rukna chahie, ise roka janaa chahie kyonki kisi bhi jimmedaar netaa ko is prakaar kii baaten nahin kerani chahie
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao said in his tweet that "the head of abusive words: Abuser in Chief:" returned to justify his 'lowly' remarks of 2017
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ayyar ne tab apni kharaab hindi kaa bahaanaa banaakar maafee maangi thi
 Now they are saying that their assessment was correct
 congress ne pichley saal unke nilamban ko waapas le liya tha 
 The Congress's double character and arrogance again surfaced
 '' vahiin congress pravaktaa jaiveer shergill ne ayyar ke lekh ke bare main puche jane par kaha ki khud lekh main kaha gaya he ki ye lekhak ke nijee vichaar hai

 vittamantralay se ek sansanikhej khabar saamne ai he
 According to the Indian Express newspaper a few months ago, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had expressed doubt that there was a breach in the security of his office
 akhbaar kaa daawa he ki vitt mantri ne pradhanmantri se isaki khufia tareeke se jaanch karaane kii guzarish kii thi
 On September 7 last year, he wrote a letter to Manmohan Singh for this
 indian express ke mutabik vitt mantri ne apni chitthee main likhaa tha ki unke daftar main 16 ahm jagahon par chipakane vaale padaarth dikhe the
 He had expressed doubt that there might be an attempt to monitor the functioning of the ministry
 jin 16 jagahon par chipakane vaale padaarth paae gaye the unamem vitt mantri kaa daftar, unke salaahkaar omita paul kaa daftar, niji sachiv manoj pant kaa daftar or vitt mantri dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale do conference room shaamil the
 However, the finance minister also wrote that no microphone or recording device with adhesive material was found
 chipakane vaale padaarthon kii maujuudagi kaa pataa tab chalaa tha jab central board of direct taxes ne privet detective kii team se vitt mantralayal kii jaanch karai thi
 Citing the CBDT, The Indian Express has written that adhesive materials were found on the finance minister's table at three places, one of which had traces that suspected of being pasted on an electronic device
 baad main ibi ne un chipakane vaale padaarth ko mahaj chvingam qaraar diya tha halaki khufia vibhaag ne abtak is bare main report nahin di he
 On the other hand, the CBDT claims that the adhesive material was deliberately installed in the office
 philhal ajtak apni taraf se is khabar kii pushti karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 However, the IB investigation claimed that the adhesive was chewing gum
 ab vitt mantralay main jasusi kii ashanka kii khabar par vitt mantri pranab mukherjee kii pratikriya aa gai he
 Pranab Mukherjee has said that the IB had investigated the matter and i would like to clarify that it did not find anything there
 vitt mantri ke daftar main jasusi kii ashanka kii khabar ke baad kai sawaal hai jo sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par sawalia nishaan laga rahe hai
 The biggest question is, why were the offices of the Finance Ministry investigated by private spies? What were the private detectives employed in the Finance Minister's office to find? The matter was a breach in security, but why did Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee not convey this information to Home Minister p Chidambaram? Why did the Finance Minister complain directly to the PM? And finally, the biggest question is who is the person who was keeping an eye on the Finance Ministry

 The Sheila government's vote-bank breathtaking development policy has been accelerated
 haal hi main dilli sarkaar ne ek taraf to avaidh coloniyon ko regularaise karne kii prakriya shuru kar di, to duusari taraf in coloniyon main buniyadi suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaane kaa kaam shuru kar diya or ye kaam saunpa gaya he diesidisi ko
 The streets and drains of Sonia Vihar's e-block are in worse condition
 avaidh colony hone ke chalate ye ilaaka buniyadi suvidhaon ke liye tarasata rahaa he
 But right on this election occasion, Delhi government has remembered this vote-bank
 diesidisi yani Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation ne sadak or naaliyon ko banane kaa kaam shuru kar diya he
 This development work is going on in 371 illegal colonies of Delhi
 diesidisi ke mutabik ab tak 800 kilometre sadaken or 1500 kimi lambii naaliyaan taiyaar kar di gai hai
 1334 crores have been spent for development in these illegal colonies
 iske alaava 278 karod rupee kaa vikaas kaary abhi bhi coloniyon main jari he
 But whether these development works are enough for these colonies
 sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki koi kaam nahin hai, paas ho jaati hai, saalon se kaam padaa he
 Despite the breathtaking vote-bank policies just before the election, people are not angry at all
 darasal kaam ho to rahaa he lekin behad dhimi raftaar se
 Roads and lanes have been carved for months
 naaliyaan bani to hai lekin phir se malbe se jam ho chuki hai
 Also the lack of better planning in construction works is also visible

 Where work is going on, it has also become a problem
 yahaan ye sadak itani oonchi bana di gai he
 That the level of the surrounding houses has been reduced significantly and above these electric high tension wires are creating another problem
 haalanki diesidisi kaa daawa he ki vikaas kaaryon kii gunvattta kii dekharekh kaa kaam ek independent agency ko saunpa gaya he
 But whether this work will live up to the expectations of the people or not, the people will definitely decide in the elections

 The other contender for the chair of Karnataka is Veerappa Moily
 73 saal ke obisi netaa kendriya petroleum mantri hai or 1992 se 94 tak karnataka ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai
 But the problem with Moily is that he has been out of state politics for the last several years

 She is 65 years old and has been a six-time MP from Kolar

 Siddaramaiah, 55, was with JDS before 2006
 2006 main inhone congress kaa daaman thama or phir pichhe mudakar nahin dekha

 The split of Samajwadi Party has once again come to the fore
 5 november ko jab samaajawaadee party lakhanu main apane 25 saal puraa hone kaa bhavy samaaroh manaa rahi hogi to party ke chehre or mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar akhilesh yadav vahaan maujuud nahin honge
 On Wednesday, Akhilesh Yadav sent a letter to the party's chief, Mulayam Singh Yadav, stating that he would start his rath yatra for campaigning from November 3
 pehle yah rath yatra 3 oktober se shuru honi thi jo party main mache ghamaasan ke baad taal di gai thi
 But now, by choosing the new date of Rath Yatra just 2 days before the foundation day of Samajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav has made it clear that he will not hide his displeasure

 On 22 October, state president Shivpal Yadav has called his new executive meeting and it is almost certain that Akhilesh Yadav will not be present in it either
 halaki akhilesh yadav kaaryakarini ke sadsy bhi nahin he
 At an event on Wednesday, when Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was asked whether he would be present at the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Samajwadi Party on November 5, Akhilesh Yadav did not respond
 isse pehle akhilesh yadav ke samarthak or tamaam party ke netaa pehle hi elaan kar chuke hai ki vah 5 taarikh ko hone vaale samaaroh kaa bahishkaar karenge
 The Janeshwar Mishra Trust, built next to the Samajwadi Party office, has become a new base of Akhilesh supporters and the strategy is decided by sitting there
 mangalvaar ko akhilesh ke ek samarthak atul yadav ne kaha ki un logon liye akhilesh yadav hi sab kuch he or jo kuch vah kahenge unke samarthak karne se hichakenge nahin
 The Silver Jubilee celebrations to be held on 5th were announced by Mulayam Singh Yadav himself and instructed the entire party to prepare vigorously for this
 lekin agar is samaaroh main unke bete or samaajawaadee party ke chehre akhilesh yadav hi nadaarad rahete hai to puri party kii fajihat hona tay he
