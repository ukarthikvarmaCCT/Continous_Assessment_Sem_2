 Zaira Wasim, who acted in the movie 'dangal', met the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and posted a picture on social media that Mehbooba Mufti is the role model of Kashmir
 phir zaayra ke kilaaf kashmir kaa ek tabaka bhadak gaya
 Trolling on the Internet meant that they started sending curses in the name of religion, even being called an agent of India
 zaahir he zaayra pareshaan huin or mahabuuba mufti ke saath apni tasviir hataa lee
 He also apologized that at the age of 16, he is trying to understand the world, so his mistakes can be forgiven
 purv mukhyamantri umr abdulla, javed akhtar, anupam kher or aamir khan jaise kai nami or anjaan log zaayra ke samarthan main aage aae
 Aamir has written that i have read Zaira's statement

 Zaira is a role model not only for India but for the whole world

 But there is one more fact
 usee kashmir ke noujvaan mahabuuba mufti se milane ke pehle tak zaayra kii kamyaabi kaa jashn bhi manaa rahe the
 It is also a fact that the youth of the same Kashmir came forward and defended Zaira even after the cyber attack

 a post shared by Kapil Sharma (@kapilsharma) on Nov 20, 2016 at 5:21pm PST After an unbeaten half-century from South African star AB de Villiers, Muttiah Muralitharan's spin, Royal Challengers Bangalore started their win by beating Delhi Daredevils by 20 runs in their first match of IPL-5

 The confident Delhi Daredevils, who beat Kolkata Knight Riders by eight wickets in the opening match, could neither perform well in batting nor bowling today, scoring 137 runs for seven wickets in 20 overs, losing wickets at frequent intervals at the Chinnaswamy Stadium
 
 royal chalangers bangalore kii ore se muralidharan ne chaar over main 25 ran dekar teen jabaki jahir khan, danniel vittori or andrew mcdonald ne ek ek wicket liye
 Delhi Daredevils lost their first wicket as opener and captain Virender Sehwag who could not even open the account
 vah pehle hi over kii paanchavin gend par jahir kii gend par cheteshwar pujaara ko kaich de baithe
 Earlier, the second opener Aaron Finch (25 off 24 balls) gave the team a good start with three fours in the opening three balls
 finch or ojha (26 gend main teen chauke or ek chakke se 33 ran) ne milakar duusare wicket ke liye 42 ran jode jo team kii sarvshereshth saajhedaari bhi rahi lekin iske baad koi bhi ballebaaj der tak krij par nahin tik sakaa

 Opener Andrew Macdonald (30) contributed significantly to the team
 mcdonald ne royal chalangers ko acchhee shuruuaat di lekin unke out hote hi pavilion lautne vaale khilaadiyon kii parade lag gayi
 Glenn Maxwell was Delhi's most successful bowler, taking three wickets for 32 runs in his four overs
 morne morkal ne bhi dilli ke liye do wicket hasil kiye
 De Villiers handled the innings of Royal Challengers Bangalore after the hosts lost five wickets for 85 runs
 agar dakshin africa kaa yah aakraamak ballebaaj nahin hota to bangalore kii team mushkil main ghir jaati kyoki karishmai captain danniel vittori score main teen ran jodakar ran out ho gayi
 Delhi's star bowler Irfan was in full swing today, losing 47 runs in four overs with 23 runs in the first spell of two overs
 unhen mcdonald or divilliars donon ne khub dhoyaa
 Umesh Yadav was Delhi's most economical bowler, but did not get any wickets
 unhone do over main keval aath ran diye

 But for some reason his friend breaks up
 phir wo cid (angad bedi) or rumi (ali jafar) se bhi milti he lekin kisi khaas cheez kii talash main wo khoi rahati he
 When she shifts from Mumbai to Goa, she meets Doctor Jahangir Khan aka Jag (shahrukh Khan)
 jo kaayra ko jindagi jeene kaa nayaa najariya sikhaate hai
 Jag has always been busy correcting Kaira's thinking and the way she lives her life, and ultimately the film ends
 film kyon dekhnaa chahie:1
 Alia Bhatt has proved herself perfect in many films since 2012
 chaahe wo 'student of da year' ho yaa phir 'haive'
 Once again, Aliyane has done well in this relaxed film, away from the hustle and bustle movies

 or ab police kii poochtacha main asaram kii beti bharti ne bhi akhirkaar vahi baat kubul lee, jo police usase suna chaahati thi
 Bharti agreed that she used to send girls to her father Asaram's hut, but after knowing everything, why did Bharti do this? 'yes, i believe that i know her (rape victim)
 or maine hi inhen pehali baar asaramji baapu ke ekantavaas kii kutiyaa main bhijwaya tha
 'this is the Kuboolnamah, which may prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the fate of the self-proclaimed saint Asaram surrounded by allegations of rape and sexual exploitation
 kyonki ye kubulanamaa kisi or kaa nahin balki khud asaram kii beti bharti sirumalani urf bharti shri kaa he
 According to the police, during interrogation, he confronted the victim girl Bharti and Asaram
 yahaan bharti ne naa sirf us ladki ko pahchaan liya, balki ye bhi kaha ki unhone hi use asaram ke paas kutiyaa main bhijwaya tha
 Police say that during cross interrogation, when the girl herself started questioning Bharti, Bharti had no choice but to identify her and accept the whole thing, as the girl lived in his Ahmedabad ashram
 
 haalanki bharti se ye puche jane par ki unhone sabakuch jaanate hue bhi us ladki ko asaram kii kutiyaa tak akele main kyon bhijwaya? to bharti ne jawaab diya, 'maine to ladki ko asaram ji baapu ke paas mantra diksha ke liye bhijwaya tha
 i have no idea about what happened inside the hut
 'asaram kii kalank kii kutiyaa ko lekar ye akele bharti kaa kubulanamaa nahin he, asaram kii sadhika rahi dhruvaben ne bhi police kii poochtacha main aisi kai baaten kubuli hai, jo balaatkaar kii shikaar ladki ne kahi hai
 For example, Dhruvben has confessed to knowing the four girls, the rape victim has accused Dhruvben of getting the girls miscarried
 haalanki dhruvaben ne kaha he ki un ladakiyon ko kai dfa ayurvedic dawaaon ke kaam nahin karne par ilaaj ke liye doctor ke paas lekar gai thi, lekin unhone ladakiyon kaa garbhpaat nahin karavaaya
 The Ahmedabad Police says that in the initial interrogation, this confession of both of them confirms that the statement of the victim girl is absolutely correct
 ab unhen is maamle kii tafteesh main kuch or paristhitijanya saakshyon kii darkaar he
 When the cook opened his mouth, the cook, who took the victim of Asaram's breathlessness, to Asaram's hut, when the cook opened his mouth, the listeners just kept listening
 asaram kii saansen atak gayi, kyonki uskaa ye sach naa sirf rongte khadey karne vaala tha, balki kutiyaa kii kalank-katha kaa vahi sabase bada raazdaar tha
 Now the police officers who are investigating the case have been stunned by hearing the revelations made by the two Rajdars closest to Asaram
 kyonki in raajadaaron main ek ne jahaan peedit ladki ko asaram kii kalank kii kutiyaa tak pahunchane kii baat maani he, vahiin duusari ashram main us ladki kii saheli rahi he
 They have told that Asaram raped not only one but girls in the name of dedication and harmony for many years in the ashram of Ahmedabad
 ladakiyon ko apane kalank kii kutiyaa main bula kar unka yon shoshan karte rahe
 Akhilesh was the cook of Asaram
 kabhi asaram ke liye chulhaa jalaane vaale is shaks ne ab sachai kii aanch main asaram ke jhooth ko jalaane kaa faisla kiya he
 Akhilesh, a resident of Muzaffarnagar, has not only blamed all the misdeeds of Asaram in the police interrogation, has given a statement of law before the magistrate under section 164 of the crpc and got his seal of law approved
 akhilesh ne khulaasa kiya he ki ahmedabad main jis ladki ne asaram par balaatkaar kaa ilzaam lagaaya he, us ladki ko kisi or ne nahin, balki khud usee ne asaram kii kutiyaa tak pahunchaaya tha
 And Asaram acted illegally with him for hours
 police kii maane to akhilesh ne sirf is ladki ko nahin, balki kai or ladakiyon ko bhi samarpan or saannnidhya ke naam par asaram ke paas bheja tha
 He continued to work in Asaram's ashram from 1994 to 2003 and during this time he continued to make every dhatakaram of Asaram to be held in the ashram
 rasoie kii patni ko bhi bahut kuch malunkhilesh kii patni varsha ashram kii vaktaa thi
 What Akhilesh's wife Varsha has revealed about Asaram is even more shocking than anywhere else
 kyonki varsha sirf asaram kii karatuuton kii gavaah hi nahin rahi, balki us ladki kii saheli bhi rahi he, jis ladki ne asaram par balaatkaar kaa ilzaam lagaaya he
 According to police sources, Varsha told the police how this girl was seduced by Asaram's operatives and brought her to the hut of solitude
 or kai ghante guzaarane ke baad jab wo kutiyaa se baahar ai to ghabrahat or takaleef ke maare use bukhaar tak ho gaya

 Film Name: Welcome backdirector: Anees Bazmistar Cast: John Abraham, Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar, Paresh Rawal, Naseeruddin Shah, Dimple Kapadia, Shruti Haasan, Shiney Ahuja Duration: 153 minutescertification: u / a Rating: 2
 5 starsaal 2007 main relies hui film 'welcome' ke 8 saal ke baad usee film kii agali kisht relies hone ko taiyaar he
 Anees Bazmee has once again taken some of the characters in this film and many new actors are also associated with this franchise
 aaj bhi welcome jab tivi par aati he to dekhne kii dilchaspee barkaraar rahati he, ab kya us film kaa aglaa hissaa bhi darshakon dwaara saraahaa jayega? aaiye samiksha karte hai
 Kahani This is the story of Uday (nana Patekar), his brother Majnu (anil Kapoor), sister Sanjana (shruti Haasan) and future son-in-law Ajju Bhai alias Ajay Barsi (john Abraham)
 film main wanted bhai (nasiruddin shah) or unke bete (shaini ahuja) bhi udai or majanu ke upar raaj karte hai
 Now on one side there is the love story of Ajju Bhai and Sanjana, on the other side Uday, and Majnu start showing their love towards Chandni (ankita Srivastava), daughter of Maharani (dimple Kapadia)
 inhen sabake bich main doctor ghunghru (paresh rawal) bhi apni tamaam prakaar kii jid par ade rahete hai
 Then the film is done in the style of Anees Bazmee
 script, abhinay or sangitafilm kii script paristhiyon par aadhaarit hone vaali kamedi se bharpoor he
 The first part of Interval looks excellent, even after holding the stomach, laughs, but after Interval it seems that the story is lost elsewhere
 anis bajmi second half main kahin bhatke se lagate hai, kaaphi hili duli si kahani lagane lagati he
 By the way, the one liners and comic timing of the film was very good
 film main ek antakshri kaa sikvence he jo thahaake markar hasane par vivash kar hi detaa he
 The film's second half is very disappointing
 or shruti hasan ke saath saath jon abraham ke film main hone kii vajah bhi kaaphi arthhin dikhaai de rahi thi
 Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar, Rajpal Yadav and Paresh Rawal have excelled in acting, while John Abraham's acting is commendable
 nasiruddin shah ke abhinay main kahin naa kahin aisa lag rahaa tha kii unhen khulkar kehane kaa mauka nahin diya gaya, kaaphi bandhe bandhe se dikhaai padate hai
 At the same time Shiney Ahuja's Welcome Back, but Ankita Srivastava's place could have been cast better
 kahin naa kahidakshay kumaar kii kamifilm main khal jarur rahi thi
 The songs of the film are set up like the first one 'welcome', on one side the love song between John and Shruti, while on the other side the song 'tuti Bole Wedding Di' is also shown
 vaise ek-do geet aise hai, jinaki koi jarurat nahin thi, or unki vajah se film kii avadhi kaaphi bad jaati he
 Why see if you are a fan of big star cast and circumstances based comedy like John, Anil, Paresh, Naseeruddin Shah, then definitely watch this film
 kyon naa dekheno entry, welcome jaisi filmein aaj bhi tivi par aate hi aapkaa manoranjan karti hai, behatar he welcome back ke bhi tivi par aa jane tak kaa intjaar kar sakate hai

 lambey samay tak aisi diet follow karne se sharir ke saath mansapeshiyon par bhi bura asar padataa he
 4
 dihydration-kai wet los diet se sharir main dihydration ho jaataa he
 Constipation, headache, muscle strain and lack of energy start due to lack of water in the body
 saath hi skin bhi adhik dry ho jaati he
 5
 dimag par bura asar- wet los diet se sharir ke saath maansik sehat bhi prabhavit hoti he
 Many types of mental problems occur due to the deterioration of diet and lack of nutrition in the body

 (input bhashaa se) It was a desire to see this building of the Raza Library for a long time
 uttar pradesh ke rampur se itani baar guzara, magar is khubasurat imaarat ko baahar or bheetar se dekhne kaa mauka nahin mila
 The library is old-fashioned
 kolkata kii neshnal librari bhi isi tarah shaam ke vakt jhaank aayaa tha, jab vahaan koi nahin tha
 The Kolkata Public Library was formed in 1836, the Imperial Library in 1891, and then Lord Curzon combined the two into the Imperial Library in 1903
 azaadi ke baad 1953 main yah neshnal librari ke naam se hindustan kii janata ko samarpit kar di gai
 Climbing the stairs of the Raza Library, i thought of Kolkata
 librari ke sahyogi kaaphi rochak tareeke se bataa rahe the ki dekhie sidhiyon, darvaaze or deevaaron par verma kii tik lakadiyaan lagi hai
 In 1774, Nawab Faizullah Khan of Rampur laid its foundation
 nawabon kii apni ek librari hua karti thi, jise qutubanamaa kaha jaataa he
 Once, while doing research for 'ravish's report', he started calling in the areas of Western UP, then it came to know that many libraries have been finished
 baahar ke mulkon ke karidaar oune-paune daamon par kitaaben le ja chuke hai
 That report could not be made, but Raza remained hooked to see the library
 italian marble se bani in murtiyon kii umr sau saal se zyaada ho chuki he
 i wish Rampur's political heritage would have been magnificent and gentle like this corridor
 rampur ke hi hai aazam khan or muqataar abbaas naqvi, lekin unki siyaasi jubaan par is librari kaa zaraa bhi asar nahin dikhataa he
 After coming here, it felt that the city had also left this library
 vahaan javaaniyaan nahin dikhin
 Some people met, who came to see their heritage for the library
 kuch thake hue noujvaan akhbaar padhate mili
 It was told that there are a lot of scholars from Israel, America and less from India
 bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ko raza librari kii kubi maaloom hai
 He has asked for samples of heritage books from here for his two trips abroad
 raza librari bharat sarkaar ke tahat ek swytt sanstha he
 In different times, buildings were built from rooms to libraries
 is tasviir main aap hamid haul dekh rahe hai
 Its grandeur starts asking you the question, tell me where were you till now
 nawab mohammad said khan ne librari ke liye alag department hi banwaaya tha
 During the revolution of 1857, the British caused considerable damage to the library, yet the library stood up
 is hamid haul main musium he, lekin jab yah haul bana tha, tab yahaan nawab hamid ali kii court laga karti thi
 In this hall, balconies remain for women to see from above
 1905 main raza librari is imaarat main aa gai or tab se yaheen he
 In this hall, Chandilier is a celebrity in Asia and the Philips bulb in it has not been fused for a hundred years
 rampur kii raajnneeti badal rahi he
 Azam Khan has improved a lot
 rampur ko chamakaa rahe hai
 In suppressed and unconcerned tongue, it was heard that Azam Khan has enmity from the era of Nawabs
 vah librari ke complex ke baahar bane buland darwaazon ko dhaha sakate hai
 If the gates like Ajmeri Gate and Kashmiri Gate are not there, then the grandeur of this building of the library will become poor
 is kollam ko gaur se dekhie
 At the bottom is the mosque, then the church, the gurdwara jharokha above it and the temple at the top
 francisi vaastukar rhite ne is kollam kii kalpana kii thi
 Obviously, the Nawabs would have agreed
 yah imaarat hindustan ke secular hone ke tasawwur kii ek acchhee misaal ho sakati he
 How many fights can be stopped? in sab chote-chote kisson se secular hindustan banane kii prakriya aaj bhi jari he
 These small stories are about to be relieved in the midst of countless bloodshed of religious disputes
 raza librari main anek bhashaaon or lipiyon kii 17,000 pandulipiyaan hai
 The Library of Mecca also has a manuscript, so is the manuscript of the seventeenth century Ramayana
 saatvin sadi kaa likhaa hua quran he
 The Golden Quran and Ramayana are here
 satrahavin sadi kii valmiki ramayana to dekhne laayak he
 Raza Library has kept this Ramayana as if Rama is the deity of this library
 imaarat main ghuste hi pehali baat yahi bataai jaati he ki hamaare paas ek khaas valmiki ramayana he
 Ramayana was translated into Persian at the time of Akbar
 ek ramayana jaipur main he
 The Raza Library also has a Ramayana in Persian
 pro
 Shah Abdussalam and Doctor Waqarul Hassal Siddiqui have translated from Persian into Hindi
 is ramayana ko dekhnaa khud ko teen sadi peeche le jane jaisaa tha
 Pictures of 258 episodes have been made in the Mughal style
 un tasveeron main ram, sita or ravan aaj ke jamaane se bilkul alag dikhte hai
 In this picture there is also a donkey above the ten ends of the Ramayana
 raza librari ke paas jo ramayana he, uskaa anuwaad 1713 main sumer chand ne sanskrit se farsi main kiya tha
 Sumer Chand wrote during the reign of the Mughal ruler Farrukhsiyar
 ise sone ke pani tathaa keemtee pattharon ke rango se gulbuute or naksho-nigaar se louh (panne kaa upree bhaag) sajaai gai he
 Now see, one Hindu translates from Sanskrit to Persian and two Muslims translate from Persian to Hindi
 vaqaarul hasan apane anuwaad ko pustak ke rup main dekh bhi nahin sake
 He died sansar kii kisi bhi bhashaa main likhit ramayana main itani badi sankhya main rangeen tasviren nahin hai
 "bismillah-arrahman-arrahim - All praise is for the God who is my guide and it is also beautiful to be gracious
 
 
 us vahdood lacriq (adwitiya, ishwar) ke upkaar ke baad main yah ramayana likh rahaa hum
 
 
 Although three Ramayanas are found on earth, this is the Ramayana which is the desire of Shri Ram
 
 
 " The Ramayana begins with these lines
 chaar hazaar rupee main aap is ramayana ko kareed sakate hai
 Is quite heavy by the way
 isaki tasveeron par hi alag se kitaab ho sakati he
 rama-lakshmana and Sita are seen in Mughal style of royal costumes
 khaskar pagadi yaa topi bilkul hi mughaliya daur kii hai
 Some pictures have a sword in hand instead of a bow
 rishi-muniyon ke bich ke shriram dhoti or janeu main nazar aate hai
 There is a picture of Vishwamitra, Shriram and King Dasaratha, with diamonds in the pot
 yah ramayana behad sangrahntiya he
 There is a Ramayana near Rampur whose story is not told properly yet
 
 
 kahi jaani chahie
 The comments hamaari sarkarein paryaton ke vigyapanon main dharmik sthalon or mehalon ko hi dikhaati hai
 Library and museum are not even mentioned
 baahar ke mulkon main musium kaa darshan karnaa sabase mahatvapurn paryaton mana jaataa he
 Library colleagues are very helpful
 shuukravaar ko chhod raza librari sabhi din khuli rahati he
 i hope our Prime Minister Narendra Modi who emphasizes tourism will also consider this
 kam se kam akhilesh yadav uttar pradesh kii is viraasat kaa prachaar to kar hi sakate hai
 Who has stopped that he cannot promote the center's library
 itihaas to unke rajya kaa hi he
 Everyone knows Rampur's knives and Azam Khan's staunch statements, if the Raza library is called the Ramayana, the society will benefit more
 raza librari kii sidhiyon par chadhate hue mujhe kolkata kaa hi khyaal aayaa
 Library colleagues were telling in a very interesting way that see Varma's teak wood on the stairs, doors and walls
 1774 main rampur ke nawab fazulla khan ne isaki buniyaad rakhi thi
 The Nawabs used to have a library of their own, called Qutubnama
 ek baar 'raveesh kii report' ke liye research karte vakt pashchimi upi ke ilaakon main phone karne laga, to pataa chalaa ki bahut-si librari kab kii khatm ho chuki hai
 Buyers from outside countries have taken books at throw away prices
 vah report to nahin ban saki, lekin raza librari dekhne kii hook baaki rah gai
 These idols made of Italian marble have been more than a hundred years old
 kaash is galiyare kii tarah rampur kii raajnneetik viraasat bhi shandaar or saumy hoti
 Azam Khan and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi belong to Rampur, but this library has no effect on their political tongue
 yahaan aakar laga ki shahar ne bhi is librari ko chhod diya he
 The soldiers were not seen there
 kuch log mili, jo librari ke liye apni viraasat ko dekhne aae the
 Some tired young men were reading newspapers
 bataaya gaya ki yahaan israel, america se kaaphi vidwaan aate hai, bharat se kam hi aate hai
 Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi knows the quality of Raza Library
 unhone apni do-do videsh yatraaon ke liye yahaan se viraasati kitabon ke namoonay mangavaaye hai
 Raza Library is an autonomous organization under the Government of India
 alag-alag daur main librari ke liye kamare se lekar imaaraten banati raheen
 In this picture you are seeing Hamid Hall
 isaki bhavyata aapse sawaal poochne lagati he ki bataao, abhi tak kahaan the
 Nawab Mohammad Saeed Khan had set up a separate department for the library
 1857 kii kranti ke samay angrezon ne librari ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya, phir bhi librari khadi ho gai
 There is a museum in this Hamid Hall, but when this hall was built, Nawab used to put Hamid Ali's court here
 is haal main auraton ko upar se dekhne ke liye balcony bani hui hai
 The Raza Library moved into this building in 1905 and has been here ever since
 is haul main shaindilear kii asia main hasti he or isame laga philips balb sau saal se fus nahin hua he
 The politics of Rampur is changing
 aazam khan ne kaaphi kuch sudhaar kiya he
 Shining Rampur dabi or apusht jubaan main sunne ko mila ki aazam khan ko nawabon ke daur se dushmani he
 He can demolish the elevated doors outside the library's complex

 The process of becoming a secular Hindustan with all these small stories is still going on

 The Raza Library has 17,000 manuscripts in several languages and scripts

 The Valmiki Ramayana of the seventeenth century is worth seeing
 raza librari ne is ramayana ko aise sambhalakar rakhaa he, jaise ram hi is librari ke devtaa hon
 On entering the building, the first thing is told that we have a special Valmiki Ramayana
 akbar ke samay ramayana kaa farsi main anuwaad karaayaa gaya tha
 a Ramayana is in Jaipur
 raza librari main bhi farsi main ek ramayana he
 Pro
 shah abdussalaam or doctor vakaarul hasal siddiki ne farsi se hindi main anuwaad kiya he
 Watching this Ramayana was like taking yourself back three centuries
 mogul style main 258 prasangon ke chitra banaae gaye hai
 In those pictures Ram, Sita and Ravana look completely different from the present day
 is tasviir main ramayana ke das siron ke upar ek gadhaa bhi he
 The Ramayana near the Raza Library was translated in Sanskrit to Persian by Sumer Chand in 1713
 sumer chand ne mughal shaasha farrukhsier ke shasankaal main likhaa tha
 It is decorated with colors of gold water and precious stones, and iron (top part of the page) is decorated with maps
 ab dekhie, sanskrit se farsi main anuwaad ek hindu karata he or farsi se hindi main anuwaad do muslim karte hai
 Waqarul Hasan could not even see his translation as a book
 unka dehanth ho gaya
 There is not such a large number of color photographs in the Ramayana written in any language of the world
 "bismillah-arrahaman-arrahim - sari prashansa us ishwar ke liye hi he, jo meraa pathpradarshak he or kripapaatr hona bhi usee ko shobhaneey he
 
 
 i am writing this Ramayana after the benevolence of that Wahudud Lashriq (unique, God)
 
 
 yadhyapi prithvi par teen ramayana pai jaati hai, parantu shriram kii manonukool ramayana yahi he

 Sri Ram is seen in the dhoti and janeu among the sages

 This Ramayana is highly collectable
 rampur ke paas ek aisa ramayana he, jisaki katha abhi thik se nahin kahi gai he
 
 
 Should be said tippaniyan Our governments only show religious places and palaces in tourism advertisements
 librari or musium kaa zikr tak nahin aata
 Visiting the museum is considered to be the most important tourist in outside countries
 librari ke sahyogi kaaphi madadgaar hai
 Raza Library is open on all days except on Fridays
 mujhe ummid he ki paryaton par jor dene vaale hamaare pradhanmantri narendra modi is par bhi vichaar karenge

 There is not such a large number of color photographs in the Ramayana written in any language of the world

 The Raza Library also has a Ramayana in Persian
 pro
 Shah Abdussalam and Doctor Waqarul Hassal Siddiqui have translated from Persian into Hindi
 is ramayana ko dekhnaa khud ko teen sadi peeche le jane jaisaa tha
 Pictures of 258 episodes have been made in the Mughal style

 In this picture there is also a donkey above the ten ends of the Ramayana
 raza librari ke paas jo ramayana he, uskaa anuwaad 1713 main sumer chand ne sanskrit se farsi main kiya tha
 Sumer Chand wrote during the reign of the Mughal ruler Farrukhsiyar
 ise sone ke pani tathaa keemtee pattharon ke rango se gulbuute or naksho-nigaar se louh (panne kaa upree bhaag) sajaai gai he
 Now see, one Hindu translates from Sanskrit to Persian and two Muslims translate from Persian to Hindi
 vaqaarul hasan apane anuwaad ko pustak ke rup main dekh bhi nahin sake
 He died sansar kii kisi bhi bhashaa main likhit ramayana main itani badi sankhya main rangeen tasviren nahin hai
 "bismillah-arrahman-arrahim - All praise is for the God who is my guide and it is also beautiful to be gracious
 
 
 us vahdood lacriq (adwitiya, ishwar) ke upkaar ke baad main yah ramayana likh rahaa hum
 
 
 Although three Ramayanas are found on earth, this is the Ramayana which is the desire of Shri Ram
 
 
 " The Ramayana begins with these lines
 chaar hazaar rupee main aap is ramayana ko kareed sakate hai
 Is quite heavy by the way
 isaki tasveeron par hi alag se kitaab ho sakati he
 rama-lakshmana and Sita are seen in Mughal style of royal costumes
 khaskar pagadi yaa topi bilkul hi mughaliya daur kii hai
 Some pictures have a sword in hand instead of a bow
 rishi-muniyon ke bich ke shriram dhoti or janeu main nazar aate hai
 There is a picture of Vishwamitra, Shriram and King Dasaratha, with diamonds in the pot
 yah ramayana behad sangrahntiya he
 There is a Ramayana near Rampur whose story is not told properly yet

 The comments hamaari sarkarein paryaton ke vigyapanon main dharmik sthalon or mehalon ko hi dikhaati hai

 When the debate on the confidence vote started in the House on Monday, the opposition Congress and the JDS did not even demand a division of the vote and Yeddyurappa passed the power test
 somvaar ko vishwaas prastaav par jab charchaa shuru hui to bies yediurppa ne har kisi ko samarthan karne kii apil kii
 However, given the current numbers, it was clear that Yeddyurappa had a majority

 The BJP currently has 105 mlas, besides claiming support for an independent MLA
 congress or jedies ke paas kul milakar 99 vidhayak hi hai
 Now that Yeddyurappa's government has passed the majority, further proceedings will begin

 During the debate in the House, HD Kumaraswamy said that the AAP (BJP) is now in the government, so stop pressuring the mlas to resign
 unhone kaha ki agar sarkaar badhiya kaam karti he to vah sarkaar ko samarthan karenge
 On the other hand BS Yeddyurappa said in his speech that his government will work for the farmers, along with other development works will be taken forward
 unhone vipaksh ko unka samarthan karne kii apil kii
 However, Congress's Siddaramaiah remained an attacker on the BJP government
 unhone kaha ki bies yediurppa kabhi janata ke samarthan ke saath siem nahin bane
 Neither did you have a majority in 2008, neither in 2018 nor now

 The biggest upset in the Asia Cup was when Bangladesh defeated Pakistan in a semi-final match
 asia main aisa lag rahaa he ki do tiimon kaa udai ho rahaa he ve hai bangladesh or afghanistan
 Two teams are sliding down like Sri Lanka and Pakistan
 srilanka to bahut hi buree haalat main ek dishaheen team ke rup main najar ai jise jarurat he ek netaa kii or prerana kii
 In contrast, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are playing like play or not play tomorrow
 yani ve aaj kaa jo match he usee main sab kuch jhonk rahe hai or uskaa unhen inaam bhi mil rahaa he
 Behind Bangladesh's success is their Premier League where players get the benefit of playing matches in international level matches
 duusari ore srilanka apane yahaan premier lig kii shuruyaat karne kii koshish kai baar kar chukaa he magar safal nahin ho paaya he
 The biggest difference between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh right now is that of players who inspire others to play well
 srilanka cricket main sangakaara ,jayavardhane, dilashaan, muralidharan or chamunda vaas ke jane ke baad koi khilaadi team main nahin he jo baakiyon ko prerit kar sake
 While in the Bangladesh team, Shakib, Musafizur Rahim and captain Mashrafe Murtaza are the players who lift the team from their game
 sabase mjedaar baat he ki bangladesh ne srilanka ke chandika hathurusingha ko coach banaaya jinke kaarykaal main team kaa pradarshan acha rahaa
 When Pakistan toured Bangladesh in 2015, Bangladesh won all three odis and also T20
 2015 ke world cap main acha khilne ke baad unki rankig saatven sthaan par aa gai
 Due to which Bangladesh qualified for ICC Champion Trophy
 phir bangladesh ne zimbabwe ko haraaya or 2016 ke asia cap ke upavijeta bane
 The comments bangladesh kii bowling ke peeche cotni vals kaa bhi haath he jo bowling coach ke saath bich main antarim coach bhi rahe
 
 vahiin srilanka main pichley 3 saal main 5 captain, 5 head coach, 4 batting coach , 4 baar chayan samiti badal chuki he
 Not only this, Sri Lanka Cricket Board has also changed 3 times in the last 3 years
 in sab chizon ne ek vakt ke vishwa vijeta team kii qamar hi tod di he
 At the same time, Bangladesh will be encouraged and elevated by reaching the final of the Asia Cup
 lekin bangladesh kii jeet ke peeche sabase badi baat he jeet ke liye unka jajba or khel ke liye sarmapan
 This is the reason why he defeats India too
 isliye inase sanbhalkar khilne main hi bhalaai he
 Not only this, Bangladesh will also be a dangerous team for the World Cup next year, which can sink the loot of any big team

 The funniest thing is that Bangladesh appointed Sri Lanka's Chandika Hathurusingha as coach under whose tenure the team performed well
 2015 main jab pakistan ne bangladesh kaa daura kiya to bangladesh ne teenon vanade jeeta or tii-20 bhi
 His ranking came in seventh place after playing well in the 2015 World Cup
 jiske kaaran bangladesh isisi champion trophy ke liye qualifi kar gaya
 Bangladesh then defeated Zimbabwe and became runners-up of the 2016 Asia Cup
 tippaniyan Behind the bowling of Bangladesh is also the hand of Kottney Walls, who was also the interim coach in the middle with the bowling coach
 
 In Sri Lanka, in the last 3 years, the selection committee has changed 5 captains, 5 head coaches, 4 batting coaches, 4 times
 yahi nahin pichley 3 saalon main 3 baar srilanka cricket board bhi badal chukaa he
 All these things have broken the back of the one time world winning team
 vahiin asia cap ke final main pahunchakar bangladesh ke hausale or buland honge
 But the biggest thing behind the victory of Bangladesh is their passion for victory and the dedication to the game
 yahi vajah he ki vah gaahe bagaahe bharat ko bhi shikast de detaa he
 Therefore, it is good to play them carefully
 yahi nahin agle saal vishwa cap ke liye bhi bangladesh ek khatarnaak team rahegi jo kisi bhi badi team kii lutiyaa dubo sakati he

 vaardaat manesar sector-1 kii he
 Where the villagers had illegally planted crops on government land
 us fasal ko hataakar kabja lene ke liye echesaiidisi ke patawaari ishwar singh apni team ke saath vahaan gaye the

 There is dozens of acres of government land in Manesar, on which the villagers started illegal cultivation to cultivate millet
 isi jameen par kabja lene ke liye ishwar singh apni team ke saath vahaan gaye the

 Dhawan, a lawyer for the Muslim side, said, the mosque built in 1528 was continuously prayed from 1528 to 22 December 1949, the Supreme Court hearing in the Ayodhya case on the 29th day in the Supreme Court
 court main muslim paksh ke vakil rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki paune paanch sau saal pehle 1528 main masjid banaai gai thi or 22 disambar 1949 tak lagaataar namaaj hui
 Till then there was no idol inside
 ek baar masjid ho gai to hameshaa masjid hi rahegi
 Advocate Rajiv Dhawan referred to the Muslim side's possession, quoting portions of the judgments of Justice Khan and Masjid Agarwal of the High Court
 unhone kaha ki bahari ahaate par hi unka adhikaar tha
 There is no proof of occupation consistently and especially, while Justice Sharma has accepted the rights and worship of Hindu parties
 haalanki donon pakshakaron ke paas 1885 se puraane rajasav record bhi nahin hai
 Aurangzeb also donated for the temples Kiarajeev Dhawan in his argument also said that Aurangzeb had also given grants for many temples
 nathdwara mandir ke bare main bhi yahi manyata he
 There is also oral and written evidence of this
 badi taadaad main log agar kisi mandir main darshan pujan karte hai to ye koi aadhaar nahin he uske juristic person hone kaa
 The drawback of the High Court's decision by Rajiv Dhawan is that there cannot be two juristic persons of the same place
 thik vaise hi jaise gurudwara or gurugranth sahib do juristic person nahin ho sakate
 Only when Gurugranth Sahib is in a gurudwara, it becomes a gurudwara
 court ne murti ko juristic person nahin manounhone aage kaha ki thakur gokulanath ji vallabhacharya ne 7 murtiyon apane saaton poton ko di thi
 Which is in Gokul
 us par hi vivaad hua
 Even then the court did not consider Murthy to be a juristic person
 dhawan kii is daleel par justise bobade ne tokate hue poocha ki bina murti ke bhi to koi devtaa ho saktaa he jaise akaash tatv, chidambaram nataraj
 Dhawan said on this, but there must be some construction, structure or shape at such a place, which leads to the belief that it is a juristic person
 chidambaram iskaa apwaad ho saktaa he
 Justice Bobade said that Chidambaram was a specific case
 is par rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki google ke mutabik ye mandir chol shasankaal main 10veen shatabdi main banaaya gaya tha
 PS Narasimha told that five temples of Shiva were built at Chidambaram
 paanch tatv ke pratik yani prithvi, jal, akaash, agni or vaayu
 Chidambaram is the symbol of the sky
