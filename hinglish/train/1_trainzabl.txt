 Due to the negligence of officials in Harpalpur of Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh, the stench caused by the rotting of thousands of quintals of onions has made people living
 18,000 quintal pyaaj kii khep malgadee se harpalpur railway stesan laai gai thi
 It was removed at the rack point and kept in the open
 is bich barish se pyaaj sadane lagi or badboo aane lagi
 When people complained, the administration swung into action
 kuch pyaaj ko vitaran kendron main bhijwane kii koshish kii gai lekin sadati pyaaj ko kahaan se kharidaar milte
 The administration started digging the pit through the contractor and destroying it
 jahaan aisa kiya ja rahaa he, vahaan paas hi ek skool sthit he
 Due to the strong smell, children have stopped coming to school
 skool prabandhan kaa kahana he ki beemaari ke dar se abhibhavak bacchon ko skool nahin bhej rahe hai
 The school management complained to the Tehsildar Jiya Fatima about the entire matter
 skool ke bacchon or unke mata-pita kaa kahana he ki jab thekedaar sepyaaj hataaneco kaha gaya to usne kaha ki kuch din pyaaj padaa rahane do phir hataa liya jayega
 Tehsildar Jia Fatima, following a strict stand on the matter, ordered the contractor to remove onions immediately
 ye maamla krishi utpaadon kii sarkari kharid ke puure system par hi sawaal uthaata he
 This shows how government money is wasted
 pehle pyaaj kii kharid par paisa kharch kiya gaya
 But it was not seen that if onion is not stored properly during the rainy season, it will rot
 abpyajsad gai to use thikaane lagane ke liye bhi paisa kharch kiya jayega
 Local people have different risk of disease
 saath hi skool ke bacchon kii padhai kaa nuksaan alag se
 But who has the answer to these questions, the government system runs on its own

 Yourskapil mishra pashchim bengal main congress is duvidha main he ki vah loksabhaa chunaav akele apane dam par lade yaa rajya main makapa ke saath gathbandhan kare
 Some party leaders are in favor of contesting elections informally by sharing seats with the CPI-M, while others want to contest on their own
 party sutron ne bataaya ki is sambandh main antim faisla congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi karenge
 The cpi-led Left Front, once the strongest in West Bengal, has lost its larger base to the Trinamool Congress, but the organization's structure still exists in the state
 congress ke varisht netaa or samanvay samiti ke adhyaksh pradeep bhattacharya ne pitiai ko bataaya ki ek dhada makapa ke saath siten saajha karne ke paksh main he or yah bahumat main he

 a party leader said, 'the majority of party leaders are in favor of sharing seats with the CPI (M), although some people are also in favor of going to the polls alone
 ham baithak bulaayenge
 'there are 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state and Congress is considering to field its candidates at least 18-20
 philhal party ke paas sirf 4 siten hai
 1 other Congress leader said that Gandhi has asked to strengthen the organization
 unhone kaha, ‘unhone antim faisla rajya ikai par choda he
 He will take the final decision only after the decision of the Bengal unit on this
 lekin hamane abhi tak apana faisla unhen nahin bataaya he ki ham rajya main loksabhaa chunaav akele dam par ladanaa chaahate hai yaa vam dalon ke saath milakar

 The media report stated that the Commission of Inquiry stated in its report, "namrata was under immense pressure after the friend turned down the marriage proposal
 is maansik tanaav or hataasha ke kaaran usne khudakushi kar lee
 "namrata, a BDS final year student of Asifa Medical and Dental College of Shaheed Mohatrama Benazir Bhutto Medical University, Larkana, was found dead in her room on 16 September

 Vishal is a brother of Namrata
 unhone kaha tha ki ek doctor hone kii haisiyat se bhi vah kah sakate hai ki unki bahan ke gale va sharir par jaise nishaan hai, usase saaf lag rahaa he ki uski hatya kii gai he
 In addition to Namrata's classmates, members of the Hindu community and members of civil society had demonstrated demonstrations describing Namrata's death as suspicious
 unhone maamle kii nishpaksh jaanch karaane kii maang kii thi jiske baad nyaayik ayog kaa gathan hua tha
 Police arrested two of Namrata's classmates in the case
 inamen se ek ne kaha tha ki namrata kii uski ghanishtha mitra thi
 She wanted to marry him but he was not ready for marriage due to social reasons
 is baat se namrata kaaphi pareshaan thi
 The post-mortem report of the case had mentioned Namrata's murder and earlier raping her
 larkana ke chandka medical college hospital kii medico-legal afasar dow
 This post-mortem report was given by Amrita

 However, there was a dispute about it later and the Commission of Inquiry stated that Drs
 amrutha ne apane adhikaar kshetra se baahar jaakar yah report di he
 The case also revealed serious negligence of the police
 forensik jaanch karne waalon ne kaha tha ki unke paas forensik saboot samay se bheje hi nahin gaye
 Fingerprints were sent after so long that there was no meaning of their existence

 a new high has come in the voice of Sachin Bansal
 kamai ke hisaab se bharat kii sabase badi online retailor company flipcart ke siio kii aawaaj main yah bataate hue kuch zyada hi josh aa jaataa he ki ve apane sapane ko nae mukaam tak pahunchane ke liye duniya main tallent dhund rahe hai
 Within 12 hours of returning home after exchanging ideas with tech leaders like Google, linkedin and Twitter in the US, 32-year-old Sachin said, "we will recruit whatever good man we find
" ham technical logon kii taadaad badha rahe hai
 Not only India, they are also bringing people from outside
 ”america ke badhate dakhal se sachin bhale hi inkaar karen, lekin bangaloru sthit flipcart ke mukhyalay main josh badaae kaa sidhaa sambandh duniya ke sabase bade online retailor amejan ke pichley june main bharat main pravesh se he
 Being bound by the rules, Amazon is not offering any retail service directly in India, but its message is clear that the father of online retail has arrived
 amejan india kaa daftar bangaloru main flipcart se sirf 13 kilometre dur he
 With nearly two decades of experience and heavy pockets, Jeff Bezoz's company can give a tough competition to Amazon Flipkart
 yah bhi sach he ki muqabla takkar kaa ho to flipcart jaisi company main chamatkaar ho sakate hai
 Amazon in naam se bharat main bazaar khulne se ek maheenaa pehle flipcart ne apana bazaar khol liya tha
 In July, he announced a simple and secure option by making online payments under the name Pejippi
 flipcart par din main ek lakh ke aasapaas saude hote hai, isliye company ko bharosa he ki is bal par munafa kama legi
 Both companies are offering similar services
 phir bhi bansal amejan se kisi tarah kii takkar se inkaar karte hai
 If Sachin is to be believed, then this contest is good
 halaat or dilachasp ho rahe hai
 We do not pay attention to competition, we are bent on increasing business anyway
 sachin kii chintaa to is baat ko lekar he ki 2020 tak unhen jo karnaa he uske mukaable abhi bahut maamuli kaam ho rahaa he
 Sachin wants to increase the number of resellers from the current 1,000 to 10,000 to 15,000 a year
 unka kahana he, ''hamane pichley aath maheenon main eco system ke saath is bare main bahut siikhaa he ki kaarobaar badhaane ke liye kisi technology chahie
 We think, more than half of the business will come from third party vendors
 ”flipcart fishan or silesilaaye vastron main apni upasthiti badhanaa chahta he, kyonki unamem ausatan 20 se 30 pratishat margin kii gunjaaish he
 In contrast, in categories such as electronics, margins are less than half this and the fare of the shipment does not come out
 fishan vaale online vikritaon kii site par zyada log aate hai
 Arvind Singhal, president of Technopak, says, "the policy of giving loyalty bonuses or products that are not available anywhere else will be effective
 ” sachin yah baat jaanate hai or unka kahana he,''flipcart kharidne ke liye acchhee jagah tab he, jab aap jaanate hon ki aapako kya khareednaa he
 If we can motivate people to buy and tell them what would be better to buy then we can get a huge market
 ”bada sawaal yah he ki flipcart aakhir kab tak ghaataa uthaakar apana customer aadhaar badhaata rahegaa
 Says Sachin, "of the 10 million people who shop online, very few still consider it a major medium
 philhal ham customer ko khush karke unhen online shopping karne ke liye prerit kar rahe hai
 Even supporters of Flipkart are not bothered about its losses
 flipcart ko fund karne vaali company vulcon capital ke sietal sthit managing diarector abhishek agarwal kaa kahana he, ''amejan kisi bhi brick (brazil, rus, bharat or china) desh main sthaneey company kaa nuksaan nahin kar pai, chaahe vah roosi diggaj ozon ho yaa china main alibaba
 i would be surprised if the situation in India changed
 ” technopac ke singhl kaa kahana he, ''bharat main paanch se chah pramukh companiyaan hongi, jinamein amejan shaamil hogi
 Sachin denies every concern in terms of cash
 unka kahana he ki flipcart kaa sara dhyaan graahak or brands badhaane par he
 He says that Flipkart should be such a company from which you can recommend buying goods from your mother and can be sure that the experience will not be bad
 amejan
 These steps are accumulating and the time for Flipkart to do or die is soon coming
 agar aap daanton ko lekar ekastra cairphul hai or mouthwash jaise upaay aajamaa rahe hai to thodaa sanbhal jaaie
 Is it not that the measures that you think are good for teeth are harming you
 aapako bataa den ki daanton kii safai or munh kii durgandh ke liye mouthwash kaa istemaal karnaa koi samajhadaari nahin he
 Gargling with mouthwash several times a day can lead to problems like yellowing of teeth and dryness in the mouth
 sar gangaaraam hospital ke medisin head doctor es pi bayotra kaa maananaa he ki daanton kii rojaanaa kii safai ke liye achche se brushing hi kaaphi he
 Riti Mehra, a Delhi-based dentist, says that if the mouthwash is used for long periods of time, it may show the opposite effect
 research se sabit ho chukaa he ki 80 fisadi maamalon main munh se durgandh aane par mouthwash yaa kisi chuing gam kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 The main reason for bad odor is bacteria which is in your tongue and it is very important to clean it daily
 iske alaava daanton ke bich main khaane ke kan rah jate hai jinhen sirf brush kar ke hi nikaala ja saktaa he
 It is not prudent to use a mouthwash for this
 dow
 According to Mehra, mint spray and chewing gum do not help remove bacteria from your mouth, they can give you relief by just stopping the problem for a while
 sirf or sirf brushing se hi aapke daaton or masoodon main lage khaane ke kan saaf ho sakate hai
 Confusions related to teeth cleaning- 1: Bad brushing causes bad odor
 sahi tathy:ye kai kaarnon se ho saktaa he, jisamen ek vajah dental hygiene bhi he
 Sometimes eating onion-like things can also cause this problem
 bhram- 2:khaanaa khaane ke baad sugar free chuing gam chabana brushing se bhi zyada asardaar he
 True Fact: It can help clean your teeth and make your breath worse, but you will still need brushing to remove plaque from your teeth
 daanton ke liye ye he phydemandaseb:isamen kaaphi maatra main fibre hota he jo daanton ke liye natural cleanser he
 It contains a lot of water which also helps in reducing sugar
 chiz:chiz munh main maujuud saliva ke flo ko badhaane main madad karata he
 It can also be called anti cavity agent
 ek study main paaya gaya he ki jo bachche chiz khate hai unke munh main acid level kam hota he
 Carrots: Dr
 Ahuja says that carrots are a good source of vitamin A
 ye daanton ke inamel banane main madad karata he or daanton ko sensitivity jaisi samasyaon se bachaata he
 Milk: According to a study by the American Dental Association, drinking a glass of milk after eating something sweet reduces the acid level in the mouth
 doctor mehara kaa kahana he ki isse badhate bacchon ke daant bhi majboot hote he
 But do not forget to clean your teeth with water after drinking milk

 How to choose your ITR form: Taxpayers have to choose from six types of tax forms and identify and select their correct ITR form based on the source of their income
 videsh parisampattiyaan, aay, agle laabh se ghaataa purti sareekhee kuch or baaten hai, jinhen apana sahi itiaar form chunane se pehle dekhnaa hota he
 If the salary, pension or interest is the only source of income and there is only one house as property, then such person has to fill the ITR-1 tax form
 jin vyaktiyon or hindu avibhajit pariwaron ko ek se adhik makaan se aay or puunjigat laabh praapt hua he, unhen form itiaar-2 bharne kii jarurat he
 The new form ITR-2A is for individuals or Hindu undivided families who have no capital gains and who own more than one house
 itiaar-3 vyavsaay se aamadani praapt karne vaale vyaktiyon / echuef ke liye he
 ITR-4 is for persons engaged in self-employment
 passport numberane form main aapako apni videsh yatraaon yaa unamem kiye gaye kharchon ke vistrut byore iskar vibhaag ko nahin dene padenge
 But if you have a passport, then your number will still have to be given to you in ITR-2 and ITR-2A
 haalanki inakam tex vibhaag aapaki videsh yatraaon ke byore imigration vibhaag se hasil kar saktaa he
 Before the bank account details, you used to give details of only one bank account for the purpose of refund
 ab se aapako pichley varsh ke dauraan kisi bhi samay sanchalit apane sabhi bank khaaton ke byore dene honge
 You have to provide all current / savings account numbers and IFS codes
 is nae praavdhaan se tex-purti prakriya main paardarshita aegi
 Under the new provisions in ITR-1, people who have exempted income (other than agricultural income above Rs 5,000) without any ceiling can now fill in Form ITR-1 (sahaj)
 vyaktiyon / echuef ke liye bhi form-4 (sugam) ke sandarbh main aise hi saral upayon kii peshkash kii gai he
 Another step has been taken that any resident, who is earning income from outside India or who has a financial interest outside India, is not allowed to file income tax returns in ITR-1
 online ritern daakhil karnaa hua aasanapahale online ritern file karne ke baad aapako uski pavati yaa itiaar-ve alag se iskar vibhaag ko post karne kii jarurat hoti thi

 On the other hand state president of Youth wing of Jogi Janata Congress Vinod Tiwari also left the party

 apatkaal soochnaaon or tamaam madhyamon ke daman ke liye kukhyat he
 Needless to say, during the Emergency there was censorship of newspapers, magazines and every information medium; Which the then Indira Gandhi government saw as a threat against itself
 ye kaala kanoon aaazaad bharat main lagu ek kitaab kii tarah bhi he
 There is hardly any year after the end of the Emergency when its pages have not been overturned like 'compulsory formalities'
 lekin, jis sarkaar kii mukhiya par tamaam soochna madhyamon ke daman kaa daag laga, filmon ke print jalaae gaye, kalakaaron kaa utpeedan kiya gaya or tamaam filmon kii bina vajah sensorship hui - usee kii sarkaar baad main apatkaal kii kaalikh se thik ulat najar aati he
 This anecdote recorded in a conversation is almost unheard of today
 darasal, indira gandhi ke naam par gulzaar kii film "aandhi" ko lekar jo raajnneetik vivaad hue uski charchaa aaj bhi kii jaati he
 The film was written by the famous Hindi litterateur Late Kamleshwar
 kissa bhi unheen se judaa he
 After the fall of the Janata Party government in 1980, when Indira returned to the central government again, she entrusted Kamleshwar as the additional director general of Doordarshan
 indira gandhi ne 1980 main kamaleshwar ko "doordarshan" kaa nideshak banaaya
 Knowing that Kamleshwar wrote a film like "aandhi"
 kamaleshwar ne bahut saal pehle apni niyukti se judaa ek kissa Aajtak
 in was shared with editor Panini Anand
 unhone niyukti se pehle indira gandhi se hui mjedaar baatcheet kaa zikr kiya tha
 What did Kamleshwar tell? Kamleshwar himself was not sure why Indira wanted to give him this responsibility
 kamaleshwar ne bataaya tha ki doordarshan ke ediji pad ke liye indira sarkaar ke prastaav se wo hairaan the
 In this connection, when Kamleshwar reached in front of Indira, he asked- "do you know that i wrote 'thunderstorm'?" Indira's answer was- "yes, you know
 " turant hi unhone yah bhi kaha- "isiilie aapako ye jimmedaari (doordarshan nideshak) de rahi hum
 "indira said-" This is so that Doordarshan can become an impartial information medium of the country
 " kamaleshwar ne doordarshan ke liye do saal tak kaam kiya
 The most repressive decision of the Emergency, made by the director of Doordarshan, the sterilization of 60 lakh people, may be based on a conversation with Kamleshwar that Indira honestly wanted to hand over the responsibility to a person working for an impartial medium
 yaa yah bhi ho saktaa he ki apatkaal main sarkaar par soochna madhyamon kii sensharship par lage daag mitaane ke liye unhone is niyukti ko hathiyaar banane kii koshish kii ho
 From this appointment, she was sending the message that transparency in things beyond the Emergency and her personal ambition is beyond politics
 kya he apatkaal se judaa aandhi kaa maamla?aandhi, 1975 main relies hui political drama film thi
 J
 om prakaash ke production main iskaa nirdesan gulzaar ne kiya tha

 isaki kahani kamaleshwar ne likhi thi
 It was alleged that it depicts the love story of Indira and her husband

 Both of them fall in love and they get married

 bahut saal baad ek ellection campagne main aarti, usee hotel main pahunchati he jahaan jeke he
 The story goes on and on, both of them again fall in love

 Although the ends of the film's story do not seem to resemble Indira's life, her look in the film is very close to that of Indira Gandhi
 25 june ko apatkaal ke dauraan indira sarkaar ne is film ke pradarshan ko puri tarah se pratibandhit kar diya tha

 When the midnight of June 25, 1975 came into force Emergency, all the rights of the public were lost Kamleshwar? Born in 1932, Kamleshwar is a well-known Hindi writer
 75 saal kii umr main 2007 main unka nidhan ho gaya tha
 He had written stories for several films like Gale, Mausam, Rajinigandha, Chhoti Baat, Rang Birangi and The Burning Train

 The CAG report said that in the allocation of 2G spectrum, companies were given spectrum on first-come and first-served policy instead of auction, due to which the exchequer suffered a loss of Rs 1 lakh 76 thousand crore
 haalanki sibiai special court main abhiyojan paksh kii taraf se kaha gaya ki 2ji spectrum aavanton se kendra sarkaar ko lagbhag 31 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua he
 The CAG report also claimed that if this allocation of spectrum license was made on time and on auction basis, the central government's earnings were set to increase by at least one lakh 76 thousand crores
 CBI kii wo chook, jisaki vajah se bari ho gaye kanimojhi-raja sahit sabhi aaropiraja ne yun pahunchaaya sarkari khajaane ko nuksaan?lihaaja, tatkaaleen telecom mantri e raja par yah aarope laga ki unhone aavanton ke niyamon main badlaav kiya or kuch companiyon ko phayda pahunchane kaa kaam kiya jisase sarkari khajaane ko nuksaan uthaanaa padaa
 It was also claimed that commission was being talked about in the entire game of 2G allocation and many companies along with the ministry were involved in this nexus
 lihaaja maamle kii jaanch kar rahi sibiai ne bhi apane aarope main bhi kaha ki e raja ne license ke liye aavedan kii taarikh main badlaav kiya or 2008 main hue is aavanton ke liye 2001 ke dar se entry fees vasuuli jiske chalate kendriya khajaane ko karodon kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa

 court main sabit nahin hua ghotaalaa, ye tha 2G kaa puraa maamalalekin sibiai ne sieji ke 1 lakh 76 hajaar karod rupee ke nuksaan se itar 30,984 karod rupee ke nuksaan kii baat court main kahi
 After which, in 2012, the Supreme Court ordered revocation of all the telecom licenses allotted during the tenure of A

 Raja was granted bail in the case after spending 15 months in jail
 2G cese: desh kaa sabase bada ghotaalaa, ek line kaa faisla
 
 
 And why all the CBI were told why the loss of just 30,984 crores is a matter of fact that while the CAG in its report in 2008 said that the government exchequer had suffered a loss of 1 lakh 76 thousand crores, whereas the CBI in 2012 gave the court only Rs 30,984 crores
 Told the loss
 darasal telecom mantralay ne 2008 main sabhi 122 license aavantit karte hue 1 lakh rupee se adhik kii rakam vasuul lee thi
 Therefore, the CBI said the loss to the exchequer was done by removing the amount of license proceeds
 vahiin jab sieji ne 2008 main apni report pesh kii tab usne aavanton ke liye rakhe sabhi license se nuksaan kaa aankalan 2001 kii tay keemton par 2008 main aavanton ke aadhaar par bataaya tha

 com / xehaxtfztm — Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp) November 22, 2018 Sidhu Shukriyanvjot Singh Modi government's discussion about Kartarpurpur Sahib started in Indian politics since Sidhu's visit to Pakistan
 centre sarkaar ke elaan ke baad siddhu ne twit kar modi sarkaar kaa aabhaar vyakt kiya
 He wrote that this decision will send a message of peace between the two countries
 i thank the Govt
 of India from the core of my heart and take a bow! i request the Hon'ble PM of Pakistan @ imrankhanptisahib to take reciprocal steps for opening the Kartarpur Sahib corridor and spread Baba Nanak's message of universal brotherhood and peace across the globe
 — Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp)november 22, 2018gauratlab he ki siddhu ke pakistan daure ko lekar kaaphi bavaal hua tha, unhone daawa kiya tha ki unke daure ke dauraan hi pakistan sarkaar kartarpur sahib coridor ke liye taiyaar hui
 'decision on Akali Dal's appeal', Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur also tweeted on this
 unhone likhaa ki akali dal kii apil par centre sarkaar ne jo kartarpur sahib coridor banane kaa faisla liya he, uske liye vah modi sarkaar kaa dhanyavad detii hai
 On Shiromani Akali Dal's persistent requests, the cabinet has given green signal to opening up of Kartarpur Sahab corridor
 Eternally grateful to@narendramodiji and the entire cabinet for taking this historic decision
 - Harsimrat Kaur Badal (@harsimratbadal_) November 22, 2018 'kaun Sidhu?' Former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal targeted Navjot Singh Sidhu after this decision
 unhone likhaa ki centre sarkaar ne jo faisla liya he, vah aitihaasik he
 Regarding Navjot Singh Sidhu, he said that Sidhu has no role in the role of Sidhu
 aapako bataa den ki sikhon ke pratham guru nanakdev ne kartarpur ko basaaya tha, kaha jaataa he ki unhone apane jivan ke antim kuch saal yahaan par hi vyateet kiye the

 Therefore, he has put his spokespersons behind Lalu Yadav
 lekin samaaj main or vishesh rup se bihar ke pichhadon, daliton or akliyaton ke bich lalu kii jo chhavi bani hui he usko todna to dur, use darkaana bhi unke pravaktaaon ke bas kaa nahin he
 Rather, the derogatory language of Nitish's people against Lalu is making Dalits and backward behind Lalu
 madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ke baad ab bhopal se saansad sadhvi pragna singh thakur ne desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ko apradhi kii sangya di he
 In Bhopal, reacting to Shivraj's statement that Nehru was called a criminal, MP Pragya Singh Thakur said that 'whatever will hurt our India, whatever will try to ruin our India, it will definitely be criminal, in this No doubt'
 aapako bataa den ki isse pehle shivaraj singh chouhan ne odisha main sadsyta abhiyaan ke dauraan desh ke pratham pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ko kashmir main dhara 370 lagavane par apradhi kaha tha, jiske baad deshbhar main vivaad khadaa ho gaya tha
 However, after coming to Bhopal, Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that whatever he said in Odisha about Jawaharlal Nehru, he said on the basis of facts
 modi-shah ke samarthak hai deshbhaktahaal hi main bhopal se saansad chunakar dilli gai sadhvi pragna singh thakur ne dhara 370 or 35a hataane par pradhanmantri narendra modi or grahamantri amit shah kii bhi jamkar tarif kii
 MP Pragya Singh Thakur even said that those who are proud of PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are patriotic
 kashmir se dhara 370 hataane par bayaan dete hue sadhvi ne kaha ki 'iske baad jo deshbhakt hai unki shrenee alag ho chuki he
 Patriots are celebrating euphoria and those who are crying cannot be patriotic
 dhara 370 or 35 e hatane par jo log khush hai, hamaare desh par garv kar rahe hai, jo log pradhanmantri narendra modi or grih mantri amit shah par garv kar rahe hai vah deshbhakt hai
 He said that this definition has been proved this time, who is with the country and who is against the country
 dhara 370 par saadhaa congress par hamalasansad pragna singh thakur ne kashmir main dhara 370 ko congress kii upaj bataate hue congress par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that 'if you have heard the speech of our honorable Speaker in Parliament and the Home Minister of the country Amit Shah in Parliament, then he has made it clear that pok is in our country, it is in Kashmir
 puure bhaag main 370 hat gai, yani akhand bharat ban gaya
 That part is not separate and our national president even said that if someone tries to separate it, we will give life for it
 vah alag bhaag he hi nahin, vah hamaare bharat kaa akhand ang he
 Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur also made a statement on Digvijay's opposition to Digvijay Singh on the removal of Article 370
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main bhopal sansadeey seat se sadhvi pragna singh thakur ne digvijay singh ko karaari shikast di he
 On Digvijay Singh, Sadhvi said that 'we had fought elections because people working for national religion should come in the middle

 On 21 June, the Karnataka assembly ordered two editors to be sent to jail for a year
 2014 main congress ke do or bijepi ke ek vidhayak ne do patrikaon ke sampadakon ke kilaaf manahani karne ke liye lekh chhapane kaa maamla uthaaya
 The speaker then referred the matter to the Privileges Committee, the committee made its motion and ordered the current speaker who was among the three complainants to send these journalists to jail
 visheshadhikaar cameti kaa kahana he ki ravi belagare baar-baar saman bhejne ke baad bhi haazir nahin hue, magar anil raju ne maafee maang lee
 But even after this, both of them continued to publish many such articles which kept defaming them
 bas spikar ke aadesh hote hi vidhansabha ke sachiv ne sarkaar ke atirikt mukhya sachiv ko sandesh bhej diya ki aadesh kaa paalan ho
 Whereas the media report said that what was published in both the magazines was not related to the proceedings of the House nor did those articles obstruct the proceedings of the House
 Hi Bangalore or yelahanka wois ke sampadakon ko ek saal kii jail ke saath-saath 10,000 rupee ke jurmaane kii bhi sazaa hui he
 Since this decision, the Congress government in Karnataka has also been criticized that the party which raises its voice for freedom of expression in Delhi, how can it see this happening in Bengaluru
 2014 main patrikaon ke kilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan kii shikaayat karne waalon main maujuuda spikar bhi hai, jo tab vidhayak the
 Condemnation in the case of breach of privilege is reprimanded, but no one listened to the punishment to be sent to jail
 bas yaheen se vivaad shuru ho gaya ki kya vidhayika ko wo faisle lene chahie jo nyaaypalika kaa kaam he
 It is the job of the judiciary to send them to jail
 isse pehle 2006 main upi vidhansabha ne ibien 7 ke khilaaf teen vidhayakon ke sting karne par visheshadhikaar kaa notice diya tha
 Recently, the Legislative Assembly had given notice of privilege when TV Today group conducted a sting related to the Muzaffarnagar riots
 ab karnataka kaa maamla saamne he
 Has the House extended the range of its privileges by sending these two journalists to jail and fixing the fine
 hindu akhbaar ne 26 june ke apane sampadakeey main likhaa he ki samvidhan ne vidhayika ko kuch visheshadhikaar die hai taaki sadan ke bheetar abhivyakti kii swatantraaa bani rahe or sadan chalaane main kisi prakaar kaa dabaav yaa prabhaav paidaa na kiya ja sake
 Can a journalist or member outside the house be brought under the purview of privilege
 paan singh tomars kaa ek dialog yaad aata he jab paan singh kaa kirdaar kahata he ki sansad main to daaku hote hai to kya yah visheshadhikaar kaa maamla banataa he
 Can any article obstruct the process of the House, even if there are elements which hurt the dignity of the House, is the law or procedure of privilege clear about all these things
 hamane is sandarbh main practice and prosijar of parliament naam kii kitaab ke panne palate jinke lekhak emen kol hai, esel shakdhar hai or jise pediti aacharya ne sampadit kiya he
 Much has been written about the process of privilege from its pages number 309 to 311
 sadan main visheshadhikaar kaa maamla uthaane se pehle spikar kii anumati leni hoti he
 In order to take up the matter of privilege, the member has to give it in writing to the Lok Sabha General Secretary
 notice ke saath-saath dastauez saunpna bhi anivaary hota he
 After receiving the notice, the speaker decides whether a matter of privilege arises in the House
 iske baad spikar kaa faisla sadsy ko bataa diya jaataa he
 The speaker can also refuse
 tab jaakar sadsy sadan main visheshadhikaar kaa sawaal uthaa saktaa he
 Matters of more than one privilege cannot be raised in a sitting of the House
 spikar kii sahmati ke baad hi visheshadhikaar kaa notice sweekaar hota he
 When the Committee of Privileges investigates and reports, it is up to the speaker to dismiss or accept it
 agar spikar swikar kar letaa he to use sadan ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he or sadan us report par faisla letaa he
 On page number 310 of this book it is written that if a newspaper report has written wrong information in the matter of the proceedings of the House or adverse remarks have been made on the House or the members, then the speaker can give the decision in case of breach of privilege Before asking the editor of the newspaper to present his case
 agar sampadak maafee maangata he yaa afsos zaahir karata he, sanshodhan chhapane ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he tab spikar visheshadhikaar hanan kaa maamla uthaaye jane kii anumati nahin detaa he
 Many times members also ask for permission to give notice of privilege to the fact that the police officer did not assault, push or obey courtesy
 iske bare main is kitaab ke pej number 311 par jo likhaa he wo dilachasp he
 One speaker after another has admitted that if the member has gone for some work other than parliamentary work and gets pushed or misbehaved, then that is not a breach of privilege or if courtesy is not followed
 Will not have privileges
 maan lijie ki kisi vidhansabha ke bheetar loksabhaa yaa uske sadsy ke bare main pratikul tippanee kar de, to uske khilaaf loksabhaa main visheshadhikaar kaa notice sweekaar nahin hota he kyonki har sadan kii apni garima or swatantraaa he
 For this, on page number 314, an interesting case is mentioned, there is a provision of punishment in case of contempt of the House or breach of privilege
 jis kitaab kaa maine hawala diya practice and prosijar of parliament usamen pej number 272 par likhaa he ki agar avmaananaa yaa visheshadhikaar kaa hanan bahut gambhir nahin he ki use giraftaar kiya jaae to avmaananaa karne vaale vyakti ko sadan kii dahleez par bulaakar shabdon se pratadit kiya jaataa he
 There have been two such cases in the Lok Sabha so far
 jab sadan kii dahleez par bulaakar pratadit kiya gaya he
 Meaning they stand at the door and the house expresses its unhappiness
 inamen se ek maamla ek saptahik patrika di blitz main chape lekh kaa bhi he
 In one case, the Secretary General of the Lok Sabha was tortured, but he was not called on the threshold of the House
 sirf house main prastaav paas hua tha
 The comments pej number 273 par prosicution of offenders main likhaa he ki visheshadhikaar ke maamle ko tay karte samay sadan ke paas vidhayika, karypalika or nyaaypalika kii shakti hoti he
 The House can act like a court
 is maamle main sadan hi sarvocch he magar sadan ko samvidhan ke daayre main hi faisla lenaa hoga
 If the House wants, then the punishment it has to give is not enough, then it can send the matter to the court
 jitna padhaa usase yahi samaj aayaa ki supreme court main ise chunauti di ja sakati he
 Once in the public gallery of Lok Sabha, a visitor shouted slogans
 us vyakti ke paas do pistal thi or pataakhe bhi the
 The house had sentenced to a month's severe punishment
 spikar ke aadesh par is faisle ko police ke paas bhej diya gaya tha
 On 19 December 1978, the Sixth Lok Sabha had decided to send former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, RK Dhawan and d Sen to jail in the midst of two sessions in the case of breach of privilege, be suspended from membership of the House
 magar 7 may 1981 ko saatvin loksabhaa ne ek doosraa prastaav paas kiya or in teenon ko nirdosh qaraar diya
 The Privileges Committee says that Ravi Belagare did not appear even after repeated summons, but Anil Raju apologized
 lekin iske baad bhi donon kai aise lekh chhapate rahe jinase inaki manahani hoti rahi
 Just after the Speaker's order, the Secretary of the Assembly sent a message to the Additional Chief Secretary of the Government that the order should be followed
 jabaki media report main kaha gaya he ki donon patrikaon main jo kuch chapa tha uskaa sambandh sadan kii kaarywahi se nahin tha or na hi un lekhon se sadan kii kaarywahi main baadha pahunchati he
 The editors of Hi Bangalore and Yelahanka Voice have been sentenced to one year in jail as well as a fine of Rs 10,000
 is faisle ke baad se karnataka main congress sarkaar kii bhi aalochana ho rahi he ki jo party dilli main abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko lekar awaz uthaati he, wo bengalooru main kaise yah sab hote dekh sakati he
 The current speaker, who was an MLA at the time, also complained of breach of privilege against magazines in 2014
 visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main ninda hoti he, fatkaaraa jaataa he magar jail bhejne kii sazaa kisi ne suni nahin
 Just from here the dispute started whether the legislature should take decisions which are the work of the judiciary
 jail bhejne kaa kaam nyaaypalika kaa hota he
 Earlier in 2006, the UP Assembly gave a notice of privilege on sting three mlas against IBN7
 haal hi main tivi today group ne jab muzaffarnagar dangon se sambandhit ek sting kiya tha tab vidhansabha ne visheshadhikaar kaa notice diya tha
 Now the case of Karnataka is in front
 kya in do patrakaron ko jail bhejne or jurmaana tay kar sadan ne apane visheshadhikaar kii seemaa kaa aisa vistaar kar diya he
 The Hindu newspaper wrote in its editorial on 26 June that the constitution has given certain privileges to the legislature to maintain freedom of expression within the House and not to create any pressure or influence in running the House
 kya kisi patrkaar yaa sadan ke baahar ke sadsy ko visheshadhikaar ke daayre main laayaa ja saktaa he
 a dialogue of Paan Singh Tomar recalls when Paan Singh's character says that if there are robberies in Parliament, does it become a matter of privilege
 kya koi lekh sadan kii prakriya main baadha daal saktaa he, sadan kii garima ko thes pahunchane vaale agar tatv hon bhi to kya visheshadhikaar kaa kanoon yaa prakriya in sab baton ko lekar spasht he
 In this context, we turned the pages of the book, Practice and Procedure of Parliament, whose authors are MN Call, SL Shakadhar and edited by PDT Acharya
 iske pej number 309 se 311 tak visheshadhikaar kii prakriya ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa hua he
 The Speaker's permission has to be obtained before a matter of privilege is raised in the House
 visheshadhikaar kaa maamla uthaane ke liye sadsy ko likhit rup main loksabhaa general secetry ko deni hoti he
 It is also mandatory to hand over the documents along with the notice
 notice milane ke baad spikar tay karata he ki sadan main visheshadhikaar kaa maamla uthe yaa nahin
 After this, the decision of the speaker is conveyed to the member
 spikar manaa bhi kar sakate hai
 Then the member can raise the question of privilege in the House
 sadan kii ek baithak main ek se zyaada visheshadhikaar ke maamle nahin uthaae ja sakate hai
 Notice of privilege is accepted only after the consent of the speaker
 visheshadhikaar samiti jab jaanch kar report detii he to spikar par nirbhar karata he ki wo use khaarij kar de yaa sweekaar kare
 If the speaker accepts, he is placed before the House and the House decides on that report
 is kitaab ke pej number 310 par likhaa he ki agar kisi akhbaar kii report main sadan kii kaarywahi ke maamle main galat jaankaree likhi gai he yaa sadan yaa sadasyon par pratikul tippanee kii gai he tab spikar ho saktaa he ki visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main faisla dene se pehle akhbaar ke sampadak ko apana paksh rakhane ke liye kahe
 If the editor apologizes or expresses regret, is ready to print the amendment, then the speaker does not allow the matter of breach of privilege
 kai baar sadsy is baat ke liye bhi visheshadhikaar kaa notice dene kii anumati maangate hai ki police adhikari ne marpet kii, dhakka-mukki kii yaa shishtachar kaa paalan nahin kiya
 What is written about this on page number 311 of this book is interesting
 ek ke baad ek kai spikar ne mana he ki agar sadsy sansadeey kaary se alag kisi kaam ke liye gaya he or uske saath dhakka mukki ho jaae yaa bura bartaav ho jaae to wo visheshadhikaar kaa hanan nahin he yaa phir shishtachar kaa paalan nahin hua to wo visheshadhikaar nahin hoga
 Suppose if someone makes adverse remarks about the Lok Sabha or its member within an assembly, then notice of privilege is not accepted in the Lok Sabha against him because every House has its own dignity and independence
 iske liye pej number 314 par ek dilachasp cese kaa zikr he sadan kii avmaananaa yaa visheshadhikaar ke hanan ke maamle main sazaa kaa praavdhaan he
 On the book number 272 in the book of Practice and Procedure of Parliament which i have cited, if the contempt or breach of privilege is not serious enough to arrest him, then the person of contempt would have been tortured with words by calling him at the threshold of the House
 is
 loksabhaa main abhi tak aise do maamle hue hai
 When harassed by calling at the threshold of the House
 matlab wo darvaaze par khadey rahete hai or sadan apni naakushi zaahir karata he
 One of these matters is an article in The Blitz, a weekly magazine
 ek cese main loksabhaa ke secetry general ko hi pratadit kiya gaya, magar unhen sadan kii dahleez par nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 Only the proposal was passed in the house
 tippaniyan The Prosecution of Offenders on page number 273 states that the House has the power of legislature, executive and judiciary when deciding a matter of privilege
 sadan court kii tarah act kar saktaa he
 In this case, the House is supreme but the House will have to take a decision within the scope of the Constitution
 agar sadan chaahe to uske paas jo sazaa dene ke adhikaar hai wo paryaapt nahin he, tab wo is maamle ko adaalat main bhej saktaa he
 From what i read, it was understood that this can be challenged in the Supreme Court
 ek baar loksabhaa kii public gailaree main kisi vijater ne naare laga die
 The man had two pistols and also crackers
 sadan ne ek maheene kii kadi sazaa sunai thi
 On the speaker's order, the verdict was forwarded to the police
 19 disambar, 1978 ko chhathi loksabhaa ne purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi, aarake dhawan or di sen ko visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main do satron ke bich ke samay main jail bhejne kaa faisla sunaaya tha, sadan kii sadsyta se nilambit kar die jaaen
 But on 7 May 1981, the Seventh Lok Sabha passed a second resolution and declared all three as innocent
 visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main ninda hoti he, fatkaaraa jaataa he magar jail bhejne kii sazaa kisi ne suni nahin
 Just from here the dispute started whether the legislature should take decisions which are the work of the judiciary
 jail bhejne kaa kaam nyaaypalika kaa hota he

 When harassed by calling at the threshold of the House
 matlab wo darvaaze par khadey rahete hai or sadan apni naakushi zaahir karata he
 One of these matters is an article in The Blitz, a weekly magazine
 ek cese main loksabhaa ke secetry general ko hi pratadit kiya gaya, magar unhen sadan kii dahleez par nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 Only the proposal was passed in the house
 tippaniyan The Prosecution of Offenders on page number 273 states that the House has the power of legislature, executive and judiciary when deciding a matter of privilege
 sadan court kii tarah act kar saktaa he
 In this case, the House is supreme but the House will have to take a decision within the scope of the Constitution
 agar sadan chaahe to uske paas jo sazaa dene ke adhikaar hai wo paryaapt nahin he, tab wo is maamle ko adaalat main bhej saktaa he
 From what i read, it was understood that this can be challenged in the Supreme Court
 ek baar loksabhaa kii public gailaree main kisi vijater ne naare laga die
 The man had two pistols and also crackers
 sadan ne ek maheene kii kadi sazaa sunai thi
 On the speaker's order, the verdict was forwarded to the police
 19 disambar, 1978 ko chhathi loksabhaa ne purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi, aarake dhawan or di sen ko visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main do satron ke bich ke samay main jail bhejne kaa faisla sunaaya tha, sadan kii sadsyta se nilambit kar die jaaen
 But on 7 May 1981, the Seventh Lok Sabha passed a second resolution and declared all three as innocent
 isse pehle 2006 main upi vidhansabha ne ibien 7 ke khilaaf teen vidhayakon ke sting karne par visheshadhikaar kaa notice diya tha
 Recently, the Legislative Assembly had given notice of privilege when TV Today group conducted a sting related to the Muzaffarnagar riots
 ab karnataka kaa maamla saamne he
 Has the House extended the range of its privileges by sending these two journalists to jail and fixing the fine
 hindu akhbaar ne 26 june ke apane sampadakeey main likhaa he ki samvidhan ne vidhayika ko kuch visheshadhikaar die hai taaki sadan ke bheetar abhivyakti kii swatantraaa bani rahe or sadan chalaane main kisi prakaar kaa dabaav yaa prabhaav paidaa na kiya ja sake
 Can a journalist or member outside the house be brought under the purview of privilege
 paan singh tomars kaa ek dialog yaad aata he jab paan singh kaa kirdaar kahata he ki sansad main to daaku hote hai to kya yah visheshadhikaar kaa maamla banataa he
 Can any article obstruct the process of the House, even if there are elements which hurt the dignity of the House, is the law or procedure of privilege clear about all these things
 hamane is sandarbh main practice and prosijar of parliament naam kii kitaab ke panne palate jinke lekhak emen kol hai, esel shakdhar hai or jise pediti aacharya ne sampadit kiya he
 Much has been written about the process of privilege from its pages number 309 to 311
 sadan main visheshadhikaar kaa maamla uthaane se pehle spikar kii anumati leni hoti he
 In order to take up the matter of privilege, the member has to give it in writing to the Lok Sabha General Secretary
 notice ke saath-saath dastauez saunpna bhi anivaary hota he
 After receiving the notice, the speaker decides whether a matter of privilege arises in the House
 iske baad spikar kaa faisla sadsy ko bataa diya jaataa he
 The speaker can also refuse
 tab jaakar sadsy sadan main visheshadhikaar kaa sawaal uthaa saktaa he
 Matters of more than one privilege cannot be raised in a sitting of the House
 spikar kii sahmati ke baad hi visheshadhikaar kaa notice sweekaar hota he
 When the Committee of Privileges investigates and reports, it is up to the speaker to dismiss or accept it
 agar spikar swikar kar letaa he to use sadan ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he or sadan us report par faisla letaa he
 On page number 310 of this book it is written that if a newspaper report has written wrong information in the matter of the proceedings of the House or adverse remarks have been made on the House or the members, then the speaker can give the decision in case of breach of privilege Before asking the editor of the newspaper to present his case
 agar sampadak maafee maangata he yaa afsos zaahir karata he, sanshodhan chhapane ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he tab spikar visheshadhikaar hanan kaa maamla uthaaye jane kii anumati nahin detaa he
 Many times members also ask for permission to give notice of privilege to the fact that the police officer did not assault, push or obey courtesy
 iske bare main is kitaab ke pej number 311 par jo likhaa he wo dilachasp he
 One speaker after another has admitted that if the member has gone for some work other than parliamentary work and gets pushed or misbehaved, then that is not a breach of privilege or if courtesy is not followed
 Will not have privileges
 maan lijie ki kisi vidhansabha ke bheetar loksabhaa yaa uske sadsy ke bare main pratikul tippanee kar de, to uske khilaaf loksabhaa main visheshadhikaar kaa notice sweekaar nahin hota he kyonki har sadan kii apni garima or swatantraaa he
 For this, on page number 314, an interesting case is mentioned, there is a provision of punishment in case of contempt of the House or breach of privilege
 jis kitaab kaa maine hawala diya practice and prosijar of parliament usamen pej number 272 par likhaa he ki agar avmaananaa yaa visheshadhikaar kaa hanan bahut gambhir nahin he ki use giraftaar kiya jaae to avmaananaa karne vaale vyakti ko sadan kii dahleez par bulaakar shabdon se pratadit kiya jaataa he
 There have been two such cases in the Lok Sabha so far
 jab sadan kii dahleez par bulaakar pratadit kiya gaya he
 Meaning they stand at the door and the house expresses its unhappiness
 inamen se ek maamla ek saptahik patrika di blitz main chape lekh kaa bhi he
 In one case, the Secretary General of the Lok Sabha was tortured, but he was not called on the threshold of the House
 sirf house main prastaav paas hua tha
 The comments pej number 273 par prosicution of offenders main likhaa he ki visheshadhikaar ke maamle ko tay karte samay sadan ke paas vidhayika, karypalika or nyaaypalika kii shakti hoti he
 The House can act like a court
 is maamle main sadan hi sarvocch he magar sadan ko samvidhan ke daayre main hi faisla lenaa hoga
 If the House wants, then the punishment it has to give is not enough, then it can send the matter to the court
 jitna padhaa usase yahi samaj aayaa ki supreme court main ise chunauti di ja sakati he
 Once in the public gallery of Lok Sabha, a visitor shouted slogans

 The house had sentenced to a month's severe punishment
 spikar ke aadesh par is faisle ko police ke paas bhej diya gaya tha
 On 19 December 1978, the Sixth Lok Sabha had decided to send former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, RK Dhawan and d Sen to jail in the midst of two sessions in the case of breach of privilege, be suspended from membership of the House

 magar 7 may 1981 ko saatvin loksabhaa ne ek doosraa prastaav paas kiya or in teenon ko nirdosh qaraar diya
 Notice of privilege is accepted only after the consent of the speaker
 visheshadhikaar samiti jab jaanch kar report detii he to spikar par nirbhar karata he ki wo use khaarij kar de yaa sweekaar kare
 If the speaker accepts, he is placed before the House and the House decides on that report
 is kitaab ke pej number 310 par likhaa he ki agar kisi akhbaar kii report main sadan kii kaarywahi ke maamle main galat jaankaree likhi gai he yaa sadan yaa sadasyon par pratikul tippanee kii gai he tab spikar ho saktaa he ki visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main faisla dene se pehle akhbaar ke sampadak ko apana paksh rakhane ke liye kahe
 If the editor apologizes or expresses regret, is ready to print the amendment, then the speaker does not allow the matter of breach of privilege
 kai baar sadsy is baat ke liye bhi visheshadhikaar kaa notice dene kii anumati maangate hai ki police adhikari ne marpet kii, dhakka-mukki kii yaa shishtachar kaa paalan nahin kiya
 What is written about this on page number 311 of this book is interesting
 ek ke baad ek kai spikar ne mana he ki agar sadsy sansadeey kaary se alag kisi kaam ke liye gaya he or uske saath dhakka mukki ho jaae yaa bura bartaav ho jaae to wo visheshadhikaar kaa hanan nahin he yaa phir shishtachar kaa paalan nahin hua to wo visheshadhikaar nahin hoga
 Suppose if someone makes adverse remarks about the Lok Sabha or its member within an assembly, then notice of privilege is not accepted in the Lok Sabha against him because every House has its own dignity and independence

 22 karod sebi ke khate main kramash: 15 june or 15 july ko jamaa karaane the
 Unhappy over the non-deposit of this amount, the court on April 17 decided to sell the Sahara Group's assets of Amby Valley in Maharashtra for Rs 34,000 crore and directed Rai to appear before the court
 sebi ne court ko bataaya he ki sahaara ko kareeb 25 hajaar karod rupee dene the, jisamen se vah 12 hajaar karod rupee jamaa kara chuke hai, jo ki byaaj samet 14 hajaar karod ho chuke hai

 Unhappy over the non-deposit of this amount, the court on April 17 decided to sell the Sahara Group's assets of Amby Valley in Maharashtra for Rs 34,000 crore and directed Rai to appear before the court
 sebi ne court ko bataaya he ki sahaara ko kareeb 25 hajaar karod rupee dene the, jisamen se vah 12 hajaar karod rupee jamaa kara chuke hai, jo ki byaaj samet 14 hajaar karod ho chuke hai
 11169 crore is still outstanding

 It is noteworthy that the Sahara chief had to decide the jail or the Bell Supreme Court
 17 april ko supreme court ne subrat raay ko court main pesh hone ke aadesh jari kiye the
 In the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had decided to auction the Sahara group's Ambi Valley, saying that 'now enough'
 maharashtra ke lonavala main kareeb 8000 acre kshetra main faili ambi vaili kii keemat kareeb 39 hajaar karod rupee he
 This decision was taken by the court after Sahara Group failed to deposit Rs 5012 crore in SEBI account within the stipulated time
 tippaniyan The court had asked Rai on November 28 last year that he should deposit Rs 600 crore by February 6 and into Sebi's refund account to stay out of jail
 nyaayalay ne saath hi aagaah kiya tha ki aisa karne main vifal rahane par unhen waapas jail bhej diya jayega
 The court sent Subrata Roy, two directors of Sahara Group, Ravi Shankar Dubey and Ashok Rai Chaudhary to Tihar Jail on March 4, 2014 but due to the death of Rai's mother, the court gave him four weeks' parole on 6 May 2016
 
 unki perol kii avadhi uske baad se hi nyaayalay badhaata rahaa he
 SEBI has told the court that Sahara had to pay around 25 thousand crores, out of which it has deposited 12 thousand crores, which has been 14 thousand crores including interest
 ab bhi 11169 karod rupee bakaayaa he
 Sahara said that they want to return the money and Amby Valley should not be auctioned as it is the only source of income for them

 There is only five days left for the Karnataka Assembly elections
 congress or bijepi ke bich kaante kaa muqabla he
 While JDS is struggling for the role of Kingmaker
 bijepi bies yediurppa ke chehre ke sahare karnataka main camel khilaane kii aas lagaae hue he
 Along with Yeddyurappa, the stronghold of the BJP and the Sangh is considered to be a stronghold of coastal Karnataka (coastal region)
 karnataka main bijepi or aresas kii hindutv kii prayogshaala isi costal belt main he
 The BJP had to bear the brunt of Yeddyurappa's rebellion in the last election in coastal Karnataka
 vahiin congress ko isi kaa phayda mila tha
 Now that Yeddyurappa is again the ruler of the BJP and the party is busy in the political politics of Hindutva
 aise main tateey karnataka kshetra main chunavi muqabla dilachasp ho gaya he
 Mangaluru, Udupi and Karwar Chikmagalur districts have about 20 assembly seats under the coastal Karnataka region
 centre sarkaar main mantri or karnataka bijepi ke firebrands netaa anant kumaar hegade karwaar jile se aate hai
 Five-time MP Hegde is identified as the face of Hindutva in the state
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko yediurppa kaa alag hokar chunaav ladanaa mahangaa padaa tha
 The party suffered heavily
 congress ko pichley vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke is majboot durg se 13 siten mili thi
 Whereas BJP had got only 3 seats
 vot share ke maamle main congress ko 43 fisadi vot mili the
 While BJP got 34 percent, JDS got 9 and others got 13 percent
 vidhansabha chunaav ke ek saal ke baad hi 2014 main hue loksabhaa ke chunaav main yediurppa kii bijepi main vaapasi hui to party kaa pradarshan bahut hi behatar rahaa
 The party got around 55 percent of the vote in the coastal region, while the Congress lost 3 percent of the vote and got 40 percent of the vote
 jedies kaa puraa vot hi khiskkar bijepi ke paas chalaa gaya
 JDS is merely 0
 3 fisadi vot mili
 In view of the 2014 voting pattern in the constituency, BJP was ahead in 17 assembly seats, while the Congress was ahead in only 3 seats
 bijepi loksabhaa kii tarj par vidhansabha chunaav main pradarshan dohraane ke betaab he
 This is the reason that from Anant Hegde to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the card of Hindutva is openly playing
 congress ke liye pichley chunaav ke nateezon ko doharaana kaaphi mushkil hai
 This is the reason why Siddaramaiah is trying his luck in South Karnataka as well as North Karnataka seat

 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki aakhirkaar bhartiya board ne pakistan ke saath match khilne kii ghoshnaa kyon kii? Actually between India and Pakistan Board N
 shrinivasana ke vakt main ek qaraar hua tha
 It wrote that the Indian team is ready to play a match with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates or any other country
 aaj is siries kii ghoshnaa karne kaa aakhri din tha
 Due to this agreement, the Board of Pakistan was continuously under pressure on the Indian board
 agar is siries kii ghoshnaa nahin hoti to pakistan bharat ko antarrashtriya adaalat main ghaseetne or 300 se 500 karod kaa harjaana dene kii dhamkee bhi de rahaa tha
 In such a situation, the Indian board somehow survived the action of Pakistan by announcing the indo-pak series
 tippaniyan The BCCI knows that in the current environment, the government will not allow the india-pakistan series under any circumstances
 match khilne ke liye videsh mantralay ko anumati deni he, kyonki match srilanka main hone vaale hai
 By the way, the channel broadcasting the match for india-pakistan series ie BCCI is also under tremendous pressure
 iske pakshdhar kehete hai ki agar bharat-pakistan world cap main khel sakate hai to srilanka main kyon nahin? magar sarkaar in daleelon ko philhal maanane se inkaar kar rahi he or disambar main srilanka main hone vaali bharat-paak siries ko radd hi mana janaa chahie
 Ceasefire violations along the indo-pak border and increasing terrorist activity in Kashmir have forced the government to take such a decision
 bharat or pakistan ke bich sachiv str kii baatcheet bhi band he
 Now the question arises that why did the Indian board finally announce the match with Pakistan? darasal bharat or pakistan board ke bich en
 There was an agreement during Srinivasan's time

 Today was the last day to announce this series
 is qaraar kii vajah se pakistan board, bhartiya board par lagaataar dabaab bana rahaa tha
 If this series was not announced, Pakistan was also threatening to drag India to international court and pay damages of 300 to 500 crores
 aise main bhartiya board bharat-paak siries kii ghoshnaa kar kisi tarah pakistan kii karrwai se batch gaya
 The comments bisisiai ko maaloom he ki maujuuda maahaul main sarkaar kisi bhi haalat main bharat-pakistan siries kii anumati nahin degaa
 The Ministry of External Affairs has to give permission to play the match, as the matches are to be held in Sri Lanka
 vaise bharat-pakistan siries ke liye broadcaster yani match prasaarit karne vaale channel kaa bhi bisisiai par kaaphi dabaab he
 Its advocates say that if india-pakistan can play in the World Cup, then why not in Sri Lanka? But the government is currently refusing to accept these arguments and the indo-pak series in Sri Lanka in December should be considered canceled

 ghar ke kaamon ko lekar akasar mahilaon kii shikaayat hoti he ki puraa din nikal jaataa he, lekin ghar ke kuch kaamon ko agar smart tareeke se kiye jaaen to ghanton kaa minuton main nipat saktaa he
 Important tips are important
 jaane kaise jhatpat nipat sakate hai ghar ke kaam:1
 Along with washing dishes in the dish washer of the house, wash children's toys and other plastic items as well
 isse duusari chizon main dhulaai ke kaamon main lagane vaala vakt bachegaa
 2
 carpet, gadde lage furniture or metress par baking soda chhidak kar 15 minute ke liye chhod den
 Then run the vacuum cleaner
 3
 If the lint roller is in the house, clean every small place by it only
 isaki madad se aapkaa kaam jhatpat ho jayega
 4
 agar ghar main jaanavar hai to uske baalo kii safai kaa sabase acha tarika he ki ek geele rabar brush ko har us jagah chalaa len jahaan uske bal jhadate hon
 5
 dashaboard main gande dhabbon ko mitaane ke liye ek puraani jurab main koi clining solyushan daalen or chalaaen
 See how your wardrobe will shine without any effort
 6
 Cleaning your gadgets is equally important in cleaning the house
 aapke phone main shaayad toilet seat se bhi zyada kitanu hote hai or ham isaki kabhi safai bhi nahin karte hai
 The best way to clean mobile, remote is to take alcohol wipes and clean them
 7
 Women should clean their purses at home as well
 purse kaa istemaal to rojaanaa hota he, lekin isaki safai kii ore shaayad hi kisi kaa dhyaan jaataa ho
 Women's bags often contain fecal bacteria
 aise main bahut jaruri he ki disimphectant wips se bag ko paanch minute dekar saaf karen
 8
 apane kichan ke dustbin ko neembu ke chhilkon se saaf karen, isaki safai bhi achche se hogi or badboo bhi kam hogi
 9
 apane ghar ke pankhons ko garmiyaan khatm hone ke baad puraane takiye ke cover se dhak den
 This will not cause dust and old pillow covers will also be used
 10
 Sleep before settling on small household chores
 khaastaur par kuch minute dekar rasoi ke kaamon ko nipta len
 This will reduce the work for the next day and the kitchen will also get clean in the morning

 Ajmal planned to attack foreigners during the Commonwealth Games to be held in Delhi the same year
 usne apane aakaa abu jandaal kaa naam liya
 Intelligence agencies found out that Abu Jandal was in Pakistan
 vah riyasat ali ke naam se vahaan rah rahaa tha or lahore ke najadik shahar muridake main sthit lashkar ke mukhyalay se lekar karachi tak uskaa aana-janaa laga rahata tha
 Then the police got a tremendous information

 lekin saudi adhikariyon ne ansaari se poochtacha kii or yah pataa laga liya ki vah vaaki lashkar kaa aatanki he
 After this, he had to decide whether to let his long-time partner Pakistan, let the Lashkar terrorist Ansari stay in Dammam or hand it over to India following international laws? The Saudi government finally decided to send him to India

 She had given him Hindi magazines to read and before leaving Karachi had conducted such dialogue sessions for her to make her Hindi better

 There are about 600 skeletal burials in the 700-acre camp at Sirsa under Baba Rahim Rahim
 ye to khud baba ke dere kii kartadharta ne police ko bataaya he
 But what did not tell is that all these skeletons are salvation or are the skeletons made after being slaughtered? Actually, the death that was natural inside the camp, Baba used to get it buried inside the camp in the name of salvation
 jabaki bahut se log dere se aaj bhi rahasyamayi taur par laapata hai
 It is suspected that Baba killed him
 isliye ab sawaal ye he ki police ye fark kaise karegi ki koun sa kankal moksh vaala he or koun sa katl vaala?700 ke acre ke apane dere main baba ne aise bahut se gaddhe khode
 Plant saplings in them as well
 kabhi aam ke kabhi amaruud ke
 Sometimes of basil and sometimes of aloe vera
 logon kii nazar baba ke paudhon par to thi
 But no one looked into these pits
 dekhte, to kya pataa usamen thande ho chuke 600 jismon kekankalanazar aate
 After Baba, the most special Vipassana of the camp and Dr
 piaar nain haryana police ke kabze main hai
 Special Investigating Team i
e
 SIT is constantly questioning him
 deraa sachcha sauda ke vaais president dow
 PR Nan has revealed about Baba in the two and a half hour inquiry, it is going to bring earthquake not only above the ground but also below the ground
 bakaul haryana police dow
 Nan said that the bones and skeletons of about 600 people may be present inside the ground of Sirsa headquarters of Dera
 ye baba ke un bhakton kii asthiyaan hai, jinhen is yakeen se dere kii zamin main dabaaya gaya ki aisa karne se unhen moksh milegaa
 Now the question is, are all the skeletons fascinated by salvation? All of the 600 deaths were natural? Do all the deaths have death certificates? Or are the corpses of salvation and the corpses murdered? This is not the first time that the bones have been revealed inside the dera's ground
 isse pehle bhi dere ke akhbaar 'sach kahuun' ne ye sach ugala tha ki dere kii in lahalhati fasalon kii neeche kankalon kaa kabristaan he
 The bones of many people can be found during excavation with JCB machines in the Dera campus
 jo aise saadhakon kii hongi jinaki dere main swaabhaavik maut ho gai thi
 The Dera chief forbade his followers to shed the ashes of the dead in the river
 kyonki isse pradooshan badhata he
 Therefore the bones of the dead were suppressed in the camp itself
 or us jagah par ped paudhe laga die jate the
 What the officials of the camp and the newspapers are saying is that the truth is how much is the lie
 philhal use maapne kaa tab tak koi paimaana he nahin
 Until the truth of buried skeletons comes out here
 zamin bol paati to cheekh chikhakar bayaan karti ki jo dafn hai wo kyon gaade gaye
 If the sky spoke, the witness would die for salvation, or was killed in Baba's liberation
 magar ye ho nahin saktaa lihaaza is sach kaa intazaar tab tak hoga jab tak dere ke andar khudaai shuru nahin ho jaati
 The true fold of these 600 skeletons is buried in Baba's camp
 pehali tah par ye lahalhati kheti he
 And there are corpses in the other fold
 jinka sach abhi saamne aana baaki he
 But before that, the truth has started exploding in the mouth of the people of the camp
 baba ke dere ke adhikari zamin ke neeche kankalon kii taadaad ko lekar itane yakeen se daawa kaise kar sakate hai
 While they do not have a list of those who died
 kya unhen is baat kaa khauf he ki sarkari jesibi mashine jab zamin khodengi to kankalon ke saath baba ke kukarmon kaa khulaasa bhi ho jayega
 Even those missing people who came to the camp, but never returned
 itnaa to tay he ki baba ke dere main in paudhon kii jaden zamin ke neeche insaani haddiyon se takaraati zarur hongi
 Because the camp itself has now accepted the skeleton cemetery under this ground
 magar ye daawa to sachcha sauda kaa he
 Who is connecting these skeletons to those who are buried here for salvation
 magar unka kya karen jo baba ke dere main aakar laapata ho gaye
 From 6 months
 
 For some year
 
 From 5 years
 
 So for ten years
 jab tak baba baahar tha tab tak kehete the ki ek baar koi dere ke andar ghus gaya to na phir uski koi khabar baahar aati he
 His dead body after death
 sab kuch yaheen dabaa diya jaataa he
 There are not many secrets in this camp of 700 acres
 jin par aap aaj ye lahalhati fasalein dikh rahi hai
 How many lives are buried under this land of the camp
 kankal kiske hai
 How many marane vaale koun the
 Where were you from iskaa andaaza laga paanaa mushkil he
 Neither the police have so far got a list of those who are buried in the camp to get salvation
 haalanki baba ke purv bhakton kaa daawa he ki moksh to bahaanaa he
 Beneath this land are the dead bodies of all those who were trying to go against Baba
 unhen markar yahaan dafnaaya gaya he
 Currently the chairperson of Dera Sacha Sauda is Vipassana Insa and Vice President Dr
 piaar nain se haryana police kii esaiti is baat kaa pataa laga rahi he ki aakhir un 600 laashon ko ashram main kis jagah dafnaaya gaya
 So that this time JCB machines are used not only to scare Baba but to dig up his secrets from the ground
 bahut mushkil he jameen ke neeche kankalon se unka ata pataa nikaalnaa
 But it is not impossible
 medical science main haddiyon kii jaanch kar ke bhi kaaphi kuch pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 But the question is, what is the truth of the buried hell in the camp
 jammu evam kashmir main lagbhag 12,000 hindu 'mahakumbh' ke liye mangalvaar ko ganderbal jile main jhelum nadi tathaa sindh dhara ke sangam par jute hai
 Most of the devotees are Kashmiri Pandits
 mahakumbh main hissaa lene ke liye dilli se jammu evam kashmir pahunche ashutosh bhatnagar (44) ne kaha, "pichhali baar is tarah kaa sanyog san 1941 main bana tha, jiske 75 saal or 10 din baad phir vahi sanyog bana he
 "bhatnagar is not a Kashmiri Pandit
 unhone kaha ki ganderbal jile ke saidipora gaanv main sangam sthaneey pandit samudaay ke logon ke liye behad pavitra mana jaataa rahaa he, jisamen ve mritkon kii asthiyon kaa visarjan karte hai
 Bhatnagar said, "mahakumbh is a ceremony that devotees do not want to lose and that is why we have gathered here in large numbers to be a part of this holy ceremony
 " This year's Mahakumbh has been announced by Omkarnath Shastri, an astrologer and his family is known for publishing panchang for Kashmiris before Kashmiri Pandits left Kashmir in the early 1990s
 sangam ke sanyojak bharat raina ne kaha, "kumbh prayek 12 saal par or ardhakumbh prayek chah saal par hota he
 " unhone kaha ki 12 ghante lanbaa havan somvaar ko sangam main shuru hua, jo mangalvaar tak chalegaa
 He said, "on this occasion, devotees take a holy dip in the Sangam and go to a special place, where a tree of poplar has been present for a long time
 " Raina said, "this part of Sangam is the sanctum sanctorum of this holy site
 shraddhalu dweep par maujuud shivlinga par jal chadhaate hai
 After the havan, devotees take the prasad and distribute it to the people around them and take it to the rest of the house
 " This is the first time, after the migration of Kashmiri Pandits from the valley, they have come to participate in this ceremony in such large numbers
 isse pehle, saal 2011 main 35,000 hindu sangam main pushkar manaane ke liye ikattha hue the
 Although most of these people were South Indians
 adhikariyon ne shraddhaluon ke liye suraksha ke kade intjaam kiye hai, jo mangalvaar shaam se ghati se nikalnaa shuru karenge

 desh main nayaa kaarobaar sugam banane or yuva udhyamiyon ko iske liye protsaahit karne ke liye pradhamanantri narendra modi ne shanivaar ko 'starop india' abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar di
 For this, the Prime Minister announced to create a fund of 10 thousand crores in the next four years
 isamen har saal 2500 karod rupee kaa fund starpeps ko die jaaenge
 He also assured to keep the effort away from the license-permit raj and said that the profits from the startup would remain tax-free for three years
 pradhanmantri ne inspector culture se bhi mukti kii vyavastha banane kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 But can these promises of PM make a sudden change in India's work culture? Because the action plan is in place, there are five major challenges along the way to start up campaigns in India: 1
 sarkari vibhaagon kaa work culturehaalanki, pradhanmantri starop ke liye license-permit raaj ko khatm karne kii ghoshnaa kar rahe hai lekin bharat main sarkari karyaalayon main filein paas karana itnaa aasaan nahin hota
 Apart from this, obtaining all kinds of approvals has also proved to be the biggest difficulty for entrepreneurs to work here
 ection plan ke bare main jaankaree dete hue piem ne kaha ki starop ke laabh par 3 saal tak na to tex dena hoga or na hi koi adhikari jaanch ke liye aayega
 2
 tex dhaanchahalanki, start india kaarykram ke dauraan vitt mantri arun jetali ne sanket die ki starpeps ke liye tex dhaancha alag ho saktaa he
 Already, there is a continuing political deadlock over the GST Bill to simplify taxes in the country
 aise main ye kahana mushkil hi hogi ki sarkaar starop ke liye alag se kanoonee dhaancha prastut kar paaegi or agar aisa hota bhi he to isamen kitna samay lagegaa ye bhi ek chunauti hogi
 3
 fund rejingpiem ne kaha ki hamaare desh main idiaj kii koi kami nahin he or ham yuvaaon kii kshamta kaa puraa istemaal karenge
 However, lack of funds can prove to be a major challenge in this direction
 sarkaar ne agle chaar saal main iske liye 10 hajaar karod rupee kaa fund banane kii ghoshnaa kii he
 Every year, funds worth Rs 2500 crore will be given to start-ups
 lekin kya ye fund desh kii itani badi yuva aabaadi kii jaruraton ko puraa kar paaegi?bharat main seed funding kaa culture bhi ab tak viksit nahin ho paaya he
 Ideas that require the right funding are not available
 sarkaar kii ore se milane vaala anudaan starpeps ko badhaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he, lekin itnaa hi kaaphi nahin he
 Even though the government has launched loan schemes, but it needs to be considered whether this is enough
 4
 On the employment front, while presenting the Action Plan of Startup India program, PM said that the focus will be on making the youth of the country out of the mentality of job seekers and create job creators
 ye sambhav bhi he kyonki america main 70 percent naukariyaan starpeps ke jariye hi nikali hai
 But this will require major changes in India's educational system and means of accessing employment and it is not possible to do this so quickly

 Changes in focus area Apart from the technical, special development will also have to be focused on skill development
 ab tak sidhe taur par chal rahi bhartiya vyavastha main takneekee aadhaarit kai starpeps pehle hi kaam kar rahe hai
 But the skill development of the youth will have to be done for grassroots startups like agriculture, biotechnology and others
 aise main in kshetron ke liye skill dawalpment abhiyaan chalaane par sarkaar ko khaas dhyaan rakhana hoga
 Otherwise it will take a long time to reach its benefits at the ground level

 main ek kartavyanishth saamaanya vyakti hum
 How do you feel as Chief Minister? i feel that BJP has shown its commitment to the empowerment of women by giving me a chance
 mujhe is par bahut garv mahasoos ho rahaa he
 This is an even greater achievement for Narendrabhai as he has been consistently saying that society should use the power of woman effectively
 yah mahilaon ko shashakt banane ke liye modi sarkaar ke prayaason kaa hi nateeja he
 i still remember that when he became Chief Minister in 2001, i was shocked when i informed him that there is no separate ministry for women and child welfare in Gujarat

 With this, more than 30 lakh women are earning self-respect unlike the subsidy models seen in many places in the country
 uske baad hamane nari adaalat shuru kii, jahaan mahilaon se jude maamalon ko suljhaayaa jaataa he
 Then with the aim of making women equal partners in the ownership of property, we made a new rule that if the owner of the property is a woman, then she will not have to pay the registration fee
 isse rajya koshagaar ko pichley 10 saal main 560 karod ru
 There was a loss of crores
 lekin isane kai mahilaon ko sampatti kaa maalik banane kaa mauka diya or unhen surakshit bhavishya diya
 What is your biggest priority as Chief Minister? i want to emphasize the use of technology
