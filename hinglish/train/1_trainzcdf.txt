 Petrol and diesel may be becoming a burden on your pocket at the moment, but if everything goes well, soon they can also give you a chance to earn
 indian camodity exange (ICEX) ne share or camodity bazaar regulator sebi se petrol or dijal main vaayada kaarobaar shuru karne kii ijaajat maangi he
 The Petroleum Ministry has given permission to start futures trading in it
 ab is par antim faisla SEBI ko lenaa he
 If Sebi gets permission to start the futures business of petrol and diesel, then you will be able to buy it in a much higher quantity when petrol and diesel price decreases and then sell it when the price increases
 is tarah aap munafa kama paaenge
 SEBI approval can be given to ICEX or any other exchange
 iske baad koi bhi vyakti tay niyamon ke anusaar exange par petrol or dijal kii vaayada kaarobaar ke tahat kharidari va bikwaali kar sakegaa
 What happens is futures trading: Trading on exchanges for the purchase and sale of commodities is called futures trading
 aamtaur par har camodity ke alag-alag vaayade saude hote hai
 In futures trading, traders buy and sell at their convenience
 isaki shart yah he ki aapako kharidari yaa bikwaali kam se kam ek lot kii kerani hogi
 For this you also have to give a fixed margin
 jokhim bharaa kaarobaar:vaayada kaarobaar main zyada munafa to miltaa hi he, lekin isamen jokhim bhi kaaphi zyada hota he
 If you enter a purchase deal and the price decreases instead of increasing, you will lose
 vahiin, bikwaali ke saude main bhav bad jate hai, to bhi nuksaan jhelana padegaa
 Therefore, in futures trading, only those who have a lot of experience in it place bets
 paas nahin rakhana hoga petrol:vaayada kaarobaar main philhal jo bhi camodity aap kharidte hai, use aapako apane paas nahin rakhana hota he, balki use sidhe aap exange ke plateform par kharidte hai
 Now it has to be seen that if the futures trading in petrol and diesel is approved, then what rules and guidelines are fixed for this

 The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of the country has raised serious objections to the sale of a defense plot to a private builder in Kandivali, Mumbai in a report tabled in Parliament
 report shuukravaar ko pesh kiya gaya
 It is about 5,166 square feet of plot
 sena ke kendriya aayudh depo (siodi) ke adheen yah bhoomi 1942 se thi
 The land was given to a private company to build a residential building
 sieji ne april 2011 main kiye gaye lekhapareekshan ke baad kaha ki yah sauda raksha estate adhikari (diio) dwaara jari aniyamit anaapatti praaanpatr ke aadhaar par kiya gaya
 The report said that although some corrupt activities related to this land have been reported, the COD could not get this plot named after the Mumbai state government
 diio ne disambar 1981 tak iske liye kiraaya diya, lekin iske baad koi kiraaya nahin diya gaya, kyonki rajya sarkaar ne bill nahin bheja
 In June 1994, a Mumbai sub-district district officer told the army that a private company applied to build a residential building on the land and a no objection certificate was sought from the army
 agast 1994 main siodi ne yah kah kar iskaa virodh kiya tha ki samvedansheel kshetra ke aasapaas bahumanjila imaarat nahin banaaya ja saktaa he
 And he informed the DEO about this matter
 baad main agast 1994 main hi company ke pratinidhi se mulaakaat ke baad diio ne anaapatti praaanpatr de diya lekin bahumanjila imaarat nahin banane kii shart rakhi or isaki jaankaree jiladhikari ko de di ki nijee paksh ko bhukhand die jane par koi aapatti nahin he
 According to the report, the COD was aware of the No Objection Certificate issued by the DEO, but did nothing to confirm his tenancy and ensure his boundary wall
 kareeb 13 saalon baad june 2007 main nijee company ke ek pratinidhi ne jiladhikari dwaara jari do patron kii prati ke saath siodi se sampark kiya
 The CAG said that at an unusual pace, the District Magistrate has paid 5,166
 50 varg meter bhukhand use jari kar diya
 5 at its market price
 94 karod rupee lee gai or nau july 2007 ko kabja de diya gaya
 The comments usee maheene diio ne jiladhikari se bhoomi bikri khaarij karne kaa anuredh kiya, jisapar jiladhikari ne kaha ki tatkaaleen rajasav mantri ne bhoomi kii sthiti kii jaanch kii thi or isaki pushti kii thi ki yah rajya sarkaar kii bhoomi he
 Only then was it released to the company
 do maheene baad company ne diio ko bataaya ki uskaa daawa sweekaar kar liya gaya he or vah is par kaam shuru karegi, lekin siodi ab bhi us bhoomi par sainik tainaat kiye hue he
 The report was presented on Friday
 yah 5,166 varg foot bhukhand ke bare main he
 The land was under the Army's Central Ordnance Depot (COD) since 1942
 bhoomi ko ek nijee company ko awasaiya bhawan banane ke liye de diya gaya
 The CAG, after an audit conducted in April 2011, stated that the deal was done on the basis of irregular NOC issued by the Defense Estate Officer (DEO)
 report main kaha gaya ki haalanki is bhoomi se judi kuch bhrasht gatividhiyon kii jaankaree mili he, lekin siodi mumbai rajya sarkaar se is bhukhand ko apane naam nahin kara saki
 The DEO paid rent for it till December 1981, but no rent was paid thereafter, as the state government did not send the bill
 june 1994 main mumbai upshahri jila adhikari ne sena ko bataaya ki ek nijee company ne bhoomi par awasaiya bhawan banane ke liye aavedan kiya or sena se anaapatti praaanpatr maanga gaya
 In August 1994, the COD protested saying that multi-storeyed buildings could not be built around sensitive areas
 or is maamle kii jaankaree usne diio ko di thi
 Later in August 1994, after meeting the representative of the company, the DEO gave the No Objection Certificate but kept the condition of not building the multi-storey building and informed the District Magistrate that there was no objection to the plot being given to the private party
 report ke mutabik siodi ko diio dwaara jari anaapatti praaanpatr ke bare main pataa tha, lekin usne apni kirayedari kii pushti ke liye kuch nahin kiya or na hi apni charadivari sunishchit karai
 About 13 years later, in June 2007, a representative of the private company approached the COD with a copy of two letters issued by the Collector
 sieji ne kaha ki asaamaanya gati se jiladhikari ne 5,166
 The 50 square meter plot was released to him
 isaki keemat bazaar mulya par 5
 94 crores was taken and was captured on 9 July 2007
 tippaniyan In the same month, the DEO requested the District Magistrate to dismiss the land sale, to which the District Magistrate said that the then Revenue Minister had examined the status of the land and confirmed that it was the land of the state government
 iske baad hi ise company ko jari kiya gaya tha
 Two months later, the company told the DEO that its claim had been accepted and it would begin work on it, but the COD is still deploying troops on that land

 Will Salman Khan and Lulia Vantur belong to a couple? Will Salman climb a mare on his birthday in December this year? Salman's Fans are desperate to know the answer
 yahi vajah he ki salmaan jahaan bhi jate hai unase shaadi ke hi sawaal puche jate hai
 Ever since the news of marriage with Lulia caught on, Salman looked away from the media but Salman attended the IIFA Awards press conference
 
 
 sabase pehle yahi sawaal daaga gaya
 On the pictures with Lulia and the news of the wedding getting hot, Salman said that he will not give information about his wedding to the media but tweet directly to his fan
 salmaan ne kaha, 'nahin baba, aap logon ko kyon bataaun, twit karke apane fens ko bataaungaa
 '' Comments vaise baat shaadi kii chhidi to zikr salmaan ke chote bhai sohail ali khan kaa bhi chhidaa, jinhone salmaan- lulia kii shaadi se jude sawaal par reporter ko apshabd kahe the
 As soon as the pictures about this came out, the controversy went viral and the controversy arose and Salman had to explain this too
 salmaan ne kaha ki unki shaadi ke sawaal unke parivaar se nahin puche jane chahie
 Repeatedly moving the media mic closer to his father Salim Khan was the report's fault, so his brother Sohail called the reporter abusive
 twitor par shaadi se jude sawaalon kii baadh ko dekhen to, salmaan kii shaadi kii parvaah jaise unase or unke gharavaalon se zyaada unke fens ko hone lagi he

 Salman said, 'no Baba, why should i tell you people, i will tweet and tell my fans

 It is said that the greatest burden of this world is, the burden of the corpse of a son on the shoulder of a father
 takadir, kudarat, niyati yaa honi jaisi vajahon se agar kisi baap ke kaandhe par ye boj aan bhi padataa he, to log use dilasa de jate hai
 But what should people do when a father has to bear this burden due to inefficiency of the system? Something similar happened in Kanpur, where the deceased system of the time killed his innocent son on the shoulder of a living father
 kanpur ke ek sarkari aspataal main ek baap apane biimaar bete ko kaandhe par laade-laade ek ward se duusare ward tak daudta rahaa
 Meanwhile, when that innocent life was lost, even that unlucky father himself did not know
 dil ko cochotane vaali yah dardanaak daastaan kanpur ke helat aspataal kii he
 Neither Stretcher was found in the hospital nor Sunil, living in wheelchairfjalganj area, reached Halat Hospital in Ilaj on 26 August with his ailing son Ansh
 lekin vahaan main naa to wheelchair tha or hi strechar
 Ansh was in very poor condition
 lihaaja, sunil use lekar aspataal ke immergency ward main pahunch gaye, lekin vahaan doctoron ne bachche kii jaanch karne yaa phir koi shuruaati ilaaj karne se pehle hi unhen children ward kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 Due to no stretcher or any other help, Sunil rushed the child from the emergency to the children's ward
 kandhe par pade-pade hi ansh kii maasoom jaan chali gai
 Ambulance not received from the hospital
 It was the heart of a father who could not even accept the truth of innocent death
 sunil iske baad bhi ansh kii laash kandhe par liye-liye doctoron se minnaten karte rahe, lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi
 Defeated, he now decided to take Ansh Keelash home, but the rot of the system blocked his path here too
 aspataal se naa to koi shav vaahan mila or naa hi ambulance
 The dead body on the shoulder and walking on the road to the main road Sunil killed the child's body on the road and traveled a distance of about two hundred meters from the hospital to the main road
 vahaan se auto main kisi tarah vah apane ghar ke nikle
 But these pictures showed what the realities of medical facilities and how the government system works in this biggest city of Uttar Pradesh, despite millions of political claims of progress

 Zarine got an entry in Bollywood because of Salman Khan
 jab salmaan film yuvaraj kii shooting kar rahe the to vahaan jarine bhi shooting dekhne pahunchi thim
 When Salman looked at Zarine, he felt that Zarine looked like a princess and would be the perfect face for his next film Veer
 100 kilo tha salmaan kii is heroin kaa vajan, ab dikhti hai aeseeisi tarah wo vir film kii lead actress bani
 Zarine recently appeared as a host in the TV show MTV Troll Police to be aired on MTV
 isamen unhone ranvijay singh ko riples kiya
 During the first hundred days of the implementation of the new system of Goods and Services Tax (GST), there was a lot of criticism for its poor implementation
 lihaaja, vitt mantri arun jetali kii adhyakshata main jiesti council kii 6 aktubar ko hui baithak main kar dhaanche or niti main thode badlaavon kaa elaan kiya gaya
 There was a possibility of such a move late in the course of saving credit, especially keeping in mind that assembly elections are going to be held in some states soon
 taaja ghoshnaaon kaa makasad niryaatkon or chote vyapaariyon ko raahat dena or 27 vastuon kii kar daron main kami laana tha
 But are the current steps adequate to compensate for the miseries these sectors have since the GST came into force on 1 July? Small relief for smes Small and medium businesses with turnover up to Rs 75 lakh per year under the original guidelines of GST Under the composition scheme, enterprises were allowed to pay a lump sum tax of 1 to 5 per cent
 lekin isamen input tex credit (itisi yani input par pehle hi die ja chuke kar ke aadhaar par kar ke boj main katautee hasil karnaa) lene kaa koi praavdhaan nahin tha
 Apart from this, the scheme was not even for those who supply to other states
 phir, jo log gaiyr-panjikrut aapurtikaron ke saath vyapaar kar rahe the, un par reverse charge maikenism (aaarasiem) ke tahat jiesti dene kii baadhyataa thi
 Generally suppliers should pay GST on sales, but where suppliers are unregistered, GST will pay who is receiving the goods or services
 aise visham niyamon ko waapas lene ke liye maang teji se uthi thi
 The amendments now made in the GST have increased the eligibility for composition scheme from an annual turnover of Rs 75 lakh to an annual turnover of Rs 1 crore
 iske alaava jiesti council ne antar-rajya vyapaariyon ke liye compojishan skim kii paatrata ke masale ko bhi mantriyon ke samooh ke supurd kar diya tha
 Then the application regarding the RCM process of those who do business with non-registered companies (which are exempted from GST as their annual turnover is below the prescribed limit) has also been deferred till 31 March 2018
 antar-rajya sevaaon par jorek anya sanshodhan antar-raji kaarobaariyon ke sambandh main he
 Originally, those who supplied inter-state supplies, except inter-state workers, had to be compulsorily registered, irrespective of their turnover
 duusare shabdon main kaha jaae to salanaa 20 lakh rupye (uttar-purv ke rajyon ke sandarbh main 10 lakh rupye) se kam salanaa turnover vaali companiyon ko anivaary panjikaran se milane vaali chhot inter state saplyrs ko uplabdh nahin thi
 Now the council has exempted service providers from the inter-state registration provision, giving relief to small suppliers of services
 inter state sarvice prowider bhi chhot ke paatr hai agar unka turnover chhot kii seemaa se kam he
 This exemption does not apply to interstate supplies of goods
 ritern kii timahi filingsalanaa 1
 GST Council has provided that such taxpayers neither have to pay tax nor file returns on monthly basis, giving relief to smes with turnover up to Rs 5 crore
 is vittiya varsh kii teesri timahi se aise karadaata timahi ritern daakhil kar sakenge
 The scheduled dates of filing quarterly tax returns for such taxpayers will be announced later
 tab tak sabhi karadaataaon ko is saal disambar tak har maheene jiestiar-3bi daakhil karnaa hi hoga
 Apart from this, all taxpayers will also have to file Form GSTR-A1,2 and 3 for the months up to July, August and September 2017
 agast or sitambar ke ritern daakhil karne kii nirdhaarit taarikh bhi abhi bataai jaani he
 All these steps are helpful, but it would be better to give GSTN a little more time to bring stability in its functioning, at least one more year
 is baat ko bhi mahasoos kiya janaa chahie ki jiesti se judi anivaary prakriyaayein panjikaran, ritern daakhil karne, karon kii adaayagi karne or rifund kii hai
 It would be prudent to allow these processes to stabilize and the remaining processes like invoice-matching are postponed
 niryaatkon ko raahatcouncil ne july se 10 aktubar ke bich niryaat kii gai vastuon par igsti rifund kii prakriya shuru karne kaa faisla kiya he
 The August dues will be settled by October 18
 rifund kii prakriya kaa bhi sarleekaran kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from this, immediate relief has been given to companies to facilitate 100% export oriented unit schemes to get advance authorization, export promotion capital goods schemes and inputs from foreign as well as domestic suppliers, etc
 to prevent the cash flow of exporters

 ab niryaatkon ko gharelu aapurtikaron se bhi vasteen hasil karne par mahaj 0
 a nominal GST of 1 per cent will have to be paid
 iske alaava dirghakaalik samaadhaan ke taur par ek i-walet khaataa suvidha bhi uplabdh karaane kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 The requirement of giving bonds or bank guarantee while clearing goods for export has been exempted
 jiestn or karadaataaon, donon kii hi taiyaari kaa abhaav dekhte hue yah tay kiya gaya he ki strot par kar katautee or i-commers parichaalan par kar sangrahan ko 31 march, 2018 tak sthagit kar diya jaae
 Problems with the e-way bill: The e-way bill (to monitor the movement of trucks between states) will be implemented in pieces from January 1, 2018 onwards
 puure deshbhar main yah 1 april, 2018 se lagu ho jayega
 This news is not good
 i-ve bill se saamaan kii aapurti main deree hi hogi or isse bhrashtachar ko bhi badhaava milegaa
 After considering applications from merchant communities, the GST Council has also recommended a reduction in GST rates on 27 items
 kuch katautiyaan to is baat par nirbhar karengi ki aakhri istemaal kii sthitiyaan kya hai
 The implementation of GST should be seen in the context of gradual progress
 isi anuroop council ko agle kuch maahon main kai or badlaavon ke liye khud ko taiyaar karnaa chahie

 Akhilesh Yadav is constantly trying to strengthen the SP-BSP friendship
 rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan akhilesh ne basapa ummidavaar bhimrao ambedkar ko jitaane kii harsambhav koshish kii, lekin bijepi ke sameekaran aurabispi vidhayak kii cross voting sahit tamaam vajahon ne mansoobon par pani pher diya tha
 To make up for this loss, the SP has now decided to support the BSP in the Legislative Council elections
 ye akhilesh kii ore se mayawati ko tohfa he, taaki bhavishya main donon dalon ke gathbandhan par koi aanch na aa sake
 MLC elections on 26 April Elections are to be held on 26 April for the 13 Legislative Council seats of Uttar Pradesh
 maujuuda vidhayakon ke sahare bijepi ke khate main 11 or vipaksh ko 2 siton par jeet tay he
 In this way, the Opposition can win one and one seat of SP in a united manner
 basapa ko sapa kaa samarthansapa ke mukhya pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne kaha ki party ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ne ghoshnaa kii he ki vidhaan parishad ke chunaav main samaajawaadee party basapa pratyaashee kaa samarthan karegi
 The SP has decided to support the BSP on 1 seat
 sapa ke is elaan ke baad saaf he ki basapa ummidavaar bhale hi rajyasabha chunaav haar gaye hai, lekin vidhaan parishad pahunchnaa tay he
 The tenure of these members is coming to full term from the Legislative Council of Akhilesh Yadav, Rajendra Chaudhary, Naresh Uttam, Umar Ali Khan, Madhu Gupta, Ramsakal Gurjar and Vijay Yadav from Purnaspa
 bispi ke vijay pratap singh or sunil kumaar chittod, ralod ke choudhary mushtak, bijepi se mohsin raja or mahendra kumaar singh kaa bhi kaarykaal puraa ho rahaa he
 Apart from this, elections are to be held on the vacant seat of Ambika Chaudhary who went from SP to BSP
 is tarah se kul 13 vidhaan parishad siten khaali ho rahi hai
 The equation of the Rajya Sabha elections is that in the Rajya Sabha elections, there was a fierce competition in 10 seats of UP
 jahaan bijepi apane 9 ummidavaaron ko jitaane main kaamyaab rahi thi
 While SP chief Akhilesh Yadav won Jaya Bachchan on 1 seat, BSP candidate Bhimrao was not able to win Ambedkar
 is par mayawati ne us samay kaha tha ki sapa kii jagah basapa hoti to bijepi ke mansoobon par pani pherane ke liye ham apane nahin balki sahyogi ummidavaar ko jitate
 But this will not harm the SP-BSP alliance

 nideshaalay ke mahanideshak jayant mishra ne ajtak ko bataaya ki is jabti ke baad bollywood main jane-maane naam yani film produsar or financer subhash dudani ko hiraasat main liya he
 After this operation, which was successful with the cooperation of BSF and Rajasthan Police, this entire matter is now being investigated in depth
 philhal to ye sara gorakhdhandha sthaneey str par hi chalata hua lag rahaa he
 Police investigation is fast
 jayant mishra ke mutabik, is puure gorakhdhandhe kaa mastermind giraftaar kar liya gaya he
 After questioning him, it is expected that soon the rest of the gang and the gangsters will also be arrested
 kyonki udaipur ke paas kisi godaam main badi maatra methvaidh drugshone kii khufia jaankaree kii pushti hone ke baad 28 aktubar ko saajha team ne shahar se kuch duuri par sthit kaldwas gaanv ke marudhar drinks ke godaam par chapa maaraa
 a cache of methaqualone tablets, powder and chemicals, which were hidden inside the walls, were recovered
 tahakikat main chalaa ki rajsamand main shrinath industries kii aad main bhi ye gorakhdhandha chal rahaa tha
 In addition to methaqualone, these bases also contain large quantities of some banned chemicals such as acetic anhydride, anthranilic acid, toluidine, phosphorus, caustic soda and trichloride, which are used in making tablets
 taliban ke sirf teen hajaar aatankwaadiyon ne pakistani fouj ke 12 hajaar javaanon ke paseene chhudaate hue pakistan main apni pehali jeet darj kar lee he
 The government of Pakistan has bowed down to the Taliban
 ab swat main chalegaa talibani kanoon
 What the Taliban wanted now would be the same in Pakistan's Swat Valley
 taliban ke saamne pakistan hukumat ne apane
 Kneeling
 swat ghati main ab naa koi jaj faisla sunayega, naa koi vakil daleel degaa
 Now Taliban law will run in Swat
 pakistan kii swat ghati main lagu kar diya gaya he shariat kanoon
 The Taliban has won the first thing that has been going on for a long time between the Taliban and Pakistan
 pakistan ko taliban kii baat manani hi padi
 Pakistan had to obey Maulana Fazlullah to bring peace and tranquility to Swat
 pakistan kii shanti samiti or aalaa maulavee ke bich ek behad gupt baithak hui, jisamen pakistan or taliban ke bich 10 dinon tak yuddh viraam par samjhauta hua
 In this meeting, the Government of Pakistan had to bow down and also believed that it would be as the Taliban wanted
 yani swat main lagu kar diya jayega shariat kanoon
 Pakistani government officials have talked with the top cleric
 uskaa naam he sufi mohammad khan
 Sufi Muhammad is the chief of tehreek-e-nifaz-e-shariat-e-muhammadi and is also the father-in-law of Taliban leader Maulana Fazullah in the Swat Valley
 sufi mohammad khan saalon se pakistan main shariat kanoon laane kii himaayat kar rahaa he or isamen uskaa saath de rahaa tha
 His son-in-law Maulana Fazlullah
 sufi mohammad khan ko paak sarkaar pichley saal hi reeha shanti vaarta ke liye reeha kiya tha
 Muslim Khan, a spokesman for the Taliban in Swat, has told the Pakistani media that under the agreement, if the Pak government allows the Sharia law to be implemented in Swat in the same way as we want, then we have no problem
 aisi surat main tamaam talibani yahaan apane hathiyaar daal denge
 But if this is not done then we can also reverse our decision of ceasefire
 taliban ne pakistan ke kabilai ilaakon main is kadar aatank machaa rakhaa he ki logon ghut ghut kar jeene ko majaboor hai
 The government of Pakistan is not able to spoil the Taliban even by wishing and now the hukum-e-pakistan has bowed before the Taliban
 ab swat main sirf taliban kaa kanoon chalegaa
 Now the question is whether the Taliban's Shari law has written the same excesses
 jaisaa ki wo ab tak logon par zulm dhaata aayaa he
 Will such needless people continue to eat the whip of Taliban
 ye majaburi he yaa phir siyasat kii chaal
 What can be the intention of the Pak government to extend the hand of friendship towards the enemy
 pakistan apane yahaan chhipe talibani aatankwaadiyon ke safaaye kii dhamkee de rahe america ko bahala rahaa he yaa phir desh main paanv pasaar rahe kattarpathiyon ko har keemat par khush rakhane kii koshish
 Whatever be the intention, Pakistan can be very expensive
 swat ke chappe chappe par chaspa he talibani kanoon kaa kahar
 Somewhere schools are being broken and people are being whipped
 kahin bekasooron kii gardan kalam kii ja rahi
 Pakistan still does not want to fight the Taliban
 wo usase kar rahaa he samjhauta, kah rahaa he swat main jo marji wo karo lekin bandook nahin uthaao
 The question is why Pakistan is kneeling
 swat main taliban se samjhauta duniya kii ankhon main dhul jhonkne kii pakistan kii nai chaal to nahin
 Pakistan is compromising peace with the Taliban in return for the implementation of Sharia law, but according to experts, this is a Pakistani move to avoid the crooked eye of America
 pakistan ke phata ilaake main lagaataar drone or missile hamale kar rahaa america saaf kah chukaa he ki taliban ke safaye ke liye use pakistan main ghus kar bhi hamale karne kii jarurat hogi to wo aisa karne se nahin hichkichaayegaa
 The United States is also eyeing the Taliban's ever-increasing terrorist activities in Swat
 saaf he ki kisi bhi keemat par swat main apana control dikhaane main hi jaradaari hukumat kii bhalaai he
 Not only this, the Pak government wants to hunt two birds with one stone by the agreement of a mutual ceasefire
 swat ke ilaake main shariat kanoon ke sabase bade pairokaar talibani netaa mullah fajalullah or unke sasur moulana sufi mohammad kaa khaasaa dabadabaa he
 tehreek-e-nifaz-e-shariat-e-muhammadi, the Taliban leader Sufi Muhammad who implemented Sharia law, is also getting open support from the army and ISI, including many political parties in Pakistan
 purv pakistani general parvej musharraf bhi maanate hai ki pakistan par kattarpathiyon kaa dabadabaa badhata ja rahaa he
 Obviously, the Zardari regime is also protected as long as this alliance of ISI, army and fundamentalists is happy
 lage haath pakistan america ko ye bhi jataana chahta he ki takat ke dam par taliban se ladanaa thik nahin or baatcheet ke jariye hi masale ko suljhaana thik rahegaa
 But the United States is not happy with this deal and earlier, the attempt to cease fire has gone in vain
 lihaaja paak sarkaar kii ye chaal us par baari bhi pad sakati he
 Pakistan's smile does not end with the implementation of Sharia law in Swat
 balki pakistan par museebaton ko pahaad yaheen se tootna shuru hoga
 This is the Taliban's first victory over the Pakistan government
 iske taliban kahaan tak jayega, iskaa andaaza saaf taur par lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The Taliban wants the hukumat-e-taliban all over Pakistan
 swat ghati se karachi or phir islamabad, uske baad lahore
 Will the Taliban take control of the whole of Pakistan by doing it gradually
 taliban ke napak iraade isaki taraf saaf-saaf ishaara kar rahe hai
 In Swat, the Government of Pakistan has already completely surrendered in front of the Taliban's insistence
 paak sarkaar ne sarender karte hue kah diya he ki taliban swat ghati main jo chaahe kare
 Now the question is that today Zardari ji has defeated the Taliban in Swat
 lekin taliban pakistan ke liye wo cancer he jo failata hi ja rahaa he or dhire-dhire pakistan ko wo itnaa kamazor bana degaa ki pakistan sarkaar chaahe bhi to kuch nahin kar sakati or swat ghati main shariat kanoon kaa lanataliban kii pehali jeet he
 Taliban leaders Baitullah Mehsud and Maulana Fazlullah have openly announced that their next target is Islamabad
 pakistan ke ek akhbaar international da news ne pichley dinon khabar di thi ki taliban kii ye dhamkee islamabad kii deevaaron par likhi ja rahi he jise shahar kaa prashasan dhulwane main laga he
 The distance of Taliban to Islamabad from Swat is only a few hundred kilometers
 taliban ne pakistan ke punjab praant main bhi pichley hafte miyawali zile ke ek police check point par hamalaa bol apni takat kii numaaish kar di
 The manner in which 85 Taliban terrorists have been caught in Karachi in the past, it is evident that the Taliban has made its base in Karachi
 yahi nahin rawalpindi main bhi kai fidain hamalon ko anjaam de chukaa he taliban
 The objective of the Taliban is to rule over pakistan-e-taliban and that Gahe Behega is also doing it
 taliban kii takat pakistan ke andruni sahyog kii vajab se hi bad rahi he or is baat se bhi tajjub nahin kiya ja saktaa ki ek din pakistan sarkaar ko puure pakistan main taliban ke saamne sarender karnaa pad jaae
 Today, of course, the Taliban is attacking the existence of Pakistan
 lekin kabhi yahi taliban pakistani khufia agency iesai or pakistani fouj kii god main paravaan chadh rahaa tha
 Pervez Musharraf gave them a chance to flourish in the courtyard of his country
 ab vahi taliban bada hokar naa sirf inhen ko ankhen dikhaa rahaa he balki puure pakistan ko nigalane nikal padaa he
 First the tribal areas of the afghan-pak border, then Phata, then Swat, then Peshawar, then Balochistan and now directly on Islamabad
 pakistan ke in tamaam ilaakon kii tasviren lagaataar daraavnee hoti ja rahi hai
 Women are being imprisoned in burqas, orders are being issued for girls to stay away from school
 mardon ke shev banane par pabandi lagaai ja rahi he
 Weapons are being held in the hands of the youth and ammo is being made by tying gunpowder on the body of young children
 kehete hai jab jeene kaa jajba ho to saal, mausam or dashak yun hi biit jate hai
 At least this is true for the 32 thousand 172 people of Madhya Pradesh who have crossed the age of 100
 khaas baat yah he ki yahaan 2001 se 2011 ke bich ke dashak ke dauraan 100 saal se adhik umr vaale logon kii sankhya lagbhag chaar guna badi he
 According to data from the Directorate of Census Works of Madhya Pradesh, the number of people over 100 years of age was 8,431 during the 2001 census in the state, which has increased to 32,172 during the 2011 census

 About 37 of this population

 In 2001, the total population of the state was 6 crore 3 lakh 48 thousand 23, of which 36
 6 fisad hissaa 18 se 40 varsh ke aayu varg kaa tha
 That is, the share of this age group in the total population of the state has also increased during the decade
 indore main he sabase adhik yuva jansankhyarajya main 18 se 40 varsh kii umr ke logon kii sabase adhik aabaadi indore main he
 The number of people of this age group here is 13 lakh 58 thousand 417

 On the ruckus created by the Prime Minister's statement on Ramadan and the graveyard, Sakshi Maharaj says that he is surprised at this
 unhone kaha, 'modi ji desh ke bhagya vidhaataa hai
 Sabka Saath, everybody is following the principle of development
 unhone kabristaan ke saath shmashaan kii baat kii
 If he said that electricity is available during Ramadan, then electricity should come on Holi as well, then where does the problem stand in it
 ham jodna chaahate hai, todna nahi chaahate hai
 Opposition is breaking
 modi todane kaa kaam nahin karte, modi jodne kaa kaam karte hai
 On the pm's statement demanding the action of the Election Commission by the opposition parties, Sakshi Maharaj said that the BJP government is being formed in UP
 unhone kaha, 'vipakshi partiyon ke apane apane swaarth ho sakate hai
 Sakshi Maharaj may have an interest, but the Election Commission has no interest
 ve nirvachan ayog ko shikaayat kare
 The Election Commission is very intelligent
 ' unhone kaha, 'mere liye bhi to congress ne bavaal kiya tha
 What happened? Khoda Pahar, came out modi ji ne galat kya kah diya ? modi ji ne jo kaha he, har shabd sahi kaha he or usee sandarbh main kaha he ki sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas
 Modi ji wants to reconcile
 congress or anya dal saamanjasy ko todna chaahate hai
 Want to dispute vah khai khodna chaahate hai , jabaki modi hindu-musalamaanon ke saath saamanjasy bananaa chaahate hai
 Regarding not giving a single ticket to Muslims, Sakshi Maharaj says that BJP is a party where neither Hindu is given ticket nor Muslim is given ticket
 yahaan keval vining candidet ko tikat diya jaataa he
 In other parties, tickets are given on the basis of hindu-muslim
 unhone kaha, 'hamaare sansadeey board ne samajha hoga ki kisi musalmaan ko tikat dene se shaayad vah na jeet paae
 We brought MJ Akbar to Rajya Sabha
 mantri banaaya
 In the same way, if our government is formed in UP, then we will bring those who are qualified and will be made

 31 march 2013 ko samaapt hue vittiya varsh main takreeban 90 lakh mobile chori hone ke baavjood sarkaar kii central registry yojana abhi tak shuru nahin ho pai he
 Under this scheme, the stolen mobile was to be detected
 doorsanchaar vibhaag ke ek adhikari ke mutabik, is sambandh main america company telcordia technology ne janvari main ek trial shuru kiya tha jo safal nahin ho paaya
 Because such a large number of mobile handsets are being used in India, which have been created by cloning some phone
 china se har saal badi taadaad main saste mobile hamaare desh main aa rahe hai
 All attempts by dot and TRAI to stop cloning of these mobile phones have failed
 or ab yah hamaare desh kii suraksha ke liye chintaa kaa sabab banate ja rahe hai
 a senior official told us that IMEI is number one of thousands of mobile phones in India
 china se aane vaale mobile phone kii bade paimaane par chloning ho rahi he
 The TRAI requested the Ministry of Commerce in 2011 to stop importing mobiles with fake IMEI numbers from China
 magar tri ko abhi tak is sambandh main koi jawaab nahin mila
 TRAI had also demanded that only certified mobile phones be imported from China
 mjedaar baat yah he ki tri ke vartmaan chayarmen rahul khullar hi un dinon vaanijya sachiv the
 Telecom Secretary MF Farooqui said, 'we have no plans to gather information about mobile handsets
 lekin yadi kisi ko chlond mobile yaa sim ke bare main koi jaankaree chahie to ham muhaiyaa karaayenge
 According to Rajan S
 Mathew, Director General, Cellular Operators Association of India, the problem of cloning in India is increasing rapidly due to not having a unique security code of every mobile handset
 ise turant roka jaaniye chahie, varanaa original handset kaa asamaajik tatv galat istemaal kar sakate hai
 Significantly, 90 lakh mobile phones were stolen in the last financial year
 2011 main ek jaanch ke dauraan ek nishchit kshetra main 18000 mobile handset ek hi IMEI number ke mili
 About 45 percent of India's mobile market is occupied by extremely cheap handsets imported from China

 On Wednesday, around one lakh lawyers of Bihar boycotted the court proceedings against the call of the Bar Council of India (BCI) against the Higher Education and Research Bill proposed by the central government
 vakeelon kii is hadtaal kaa nyaayik kaaryon par vyapak asar padaa
 In Patna, lawyers burnt copies of the bill at the Dak Bungalow intersection and burnt effigies of Union Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal
 iske baad vakeelon ne maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar sadak jam kiya
 Apart from this, lawyers from the Law and Legislative Cell of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demonstrated outside the Patna High Court
 patna ucch nyaayalay ke edwocket association ke adhyaksh yogendra chandra verma ne bataaya ki rajya ke sabhi jila or anumandal mukhyalayon main vakeelon ne vidheyak ke virodh main uski pratiyaan jalaayin or nyaayik kaaryon kaa bahishkaar kiya
 He said that with this bill the rights of the Bar Council are being cut, while for lawyers the Bar Council is similar to the Parliament
 unhone kaha ki buudhvaar ke alaava guuruuvaar ko bhi rajya ke vakil nyaayik kaaryo kaa bahishkaar karenge
 Even after this, if the government does not accept our demands, then a big movement will be done in future
 dilli main shanivaar ko congress dikhaaegi taqatpriyanka gandhi dilli main bheed jutaney main jutiloksabhaa chunaav main karaari maat ke baad ab congress dobaaraa khadaa hone kii kavayad main jute gai he
 In this episode, the Congress is holding a 'save India rally' at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan on Saturday
 jise party adhyaksh sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh sambodhit karenge
 Priyanka Gandhi's political impact will also be seen in this rally
 uttar pradesh kii kaman jab se priyanka gandhi ko mili he, tab se soobe main congress sadakon par andolan karti najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the discussion is in full swing that Priyanka Gandhi's political impact will also be seen in the rally to be held on December 14 at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, because she has stayed in Lucknow for three days to make the rally a success
 iske baad mana ja rahaa he ki raily kii bheed main uttar pradesh kii bhagidaari badi hone ja rahi he
 From the perspective of political profit loss, the Congress has not got any major success in Uttar Pradesh at present
 priyanka gandhi ke netritv main ladaa gaya chaahe loksabhaa kaa chunaav yaa phir 13 vidhansabha siton par upachunaav ho, isamen congress kaa pradarshan acha nahin rahaa he
 Despite this, Priyanka Gandhi is having an impact in the state
 is baat kii charchaa uttar pradesh raajnneetik halkon main khub ho rahi he
 Priyanka Gandhi is constantly attacking Yogi government through Twitter and her statements and Yogi government also does not take time to reply to Priyanka Gandhi's statements and Twitter
 chaahe sonbhadra main jameen maamle ko lekar hue narsanhaar kaa maamla ho yaa phir unnav main rape peedita ko jalaane kaa maamla, priyanka gandhi donon jagahon par apane virodhiyon se bees nikali hai
 The way Priyanka Gandhi is putting herself ahead of other political leaders after a big incident in the state, it is giving them a different place in Uttar Pradesh politics
 sonbhadra-unnav cese main priyanka ne dikhaai sakriyataloksabhaa chunaav main uttar pradesh kaa prabhaar milane ke baad party kii sthiti bhale hi behatar naa hui ho
 Even though Amethi lost the election for the first time, despite all this, the Priyanka Gandhi effect is visible on the party in Uttar Pradesh
 sonbhadra main prashasan ko chakma dekar priyanka gandhi sabase pehle ghatnasthal ke liye nikali thi lekin jab prashasan ne unhen raste main roka to puri siyaasi mehfil priyanka lut le gayi, kyonki is maamle main peedit parivaar ke saath siyaasi taur par priyanka gandhi khadi dikhaai deen
 The same case also happened in the recent rape case of Unnao, when the incident of burning her was revealed, Priyanka Gandhi first reached the victim's village
 ek taraf priyanka unnav peedit ke gaanv pahunchi to duusari taraf congress ke netaa or kaaryakartaaon ne sadakon par nikalakar bijepi daftar kaa gheraav kiya or jamkar laathiyaan khain
 Congress people are saying that for the past several decades, Congress leaders have not eaten such sticks on the streets
 shaayad yah priyanka effect tha ki akhilesh yadav bhi usee vakt vidhansabha ke saamne dharne par baith gaye or mayawati bhi rajyapal se milane panhuch gayi
 Congress is playing the role of the main opposition in UP Rajiv Tyagi, UP spokesperson of Congress and important member of Priyanka's team, says that Priyanka Gandhi's communication style is very good, due to which she can communicate directly with the farmers, youth and women of the state
 Is getting sonbhadra shahjahanpur unnav or upi sarkaar bhrashtachar ke maamalon samet dchaefeel, midday mile, ld ghotaalaa, jaise muddon ko priyanka gandhi ne pramukhataa se uthaaya
 The result of this is that the state government had to bow down and accept the demands
 isse saaf jaahir he ki pradesh main 'priyanka gandhi effect' uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti main dikhne laga he
 The Congress has been able to establish itself as the main opposition party in the state's politics
 vahi, bijepi pravaktaa dow chandramohan ke mutabik,jo log upi main priyanka effect kii baat karte hai wo dekh chuke hai ki kaise priyanka ke netritv main party rahul gandhi kii seat haar chuki he or kaise sonia gandhi kii seat par bhi vot share rasaatal main gaya he
 Not only this, the Congress could not save its seat even in the by-elections
 baharhaal priyanka gandhi ke sakriyata se congress main chahal pahal badhane lagi he or sarkaar bhi zyada satark dikhaai de rahi he
 Apart from this, Priyanka Gandhi has worked hard to make the rally in Delhi on December 14 a success

 Whenever the name Sri Krishna is taken, it has never happened that the name of Kiradhaji has not been taken
 shrikrishna ko aam bhakt radhe-krishna kahkar hi pukaarte hai
 Because these two words, these two names are made for each other and no one can separate them
 koun hai radha ji?- bhadrapada shukla paksh kii ashtami tithi ko barasaane main radha ji kajanmahua tha
 - This day is celebrated in the name of Radhashtami
 - radha ji kaa janm krishna ke saath sristi main prem bhav majboot karne ke liye hua tha
 - Some people believe that Radha is a sentiment, which is obtained by walking on the path of Krishna
 - har vah vyakti jo krishna ke prem main leen hota he, radha kehalaata he
 - In the Vaishnava system, the union of Radha and Krishna is the ultimate aim of the person
 radha ashtami kaa vrath kaa mahatv-radha ashtami ke naam se is vrath ko janaa jaataa he
 By observing this fast, there is no shortage of money and the barkat remains in the house
 is vrath ko karne se bhadrapaksh kii ashtami ke vrath se hi mahalakshmi vrath kii shuruyaat bhi hoti he
 How to do Radha Ashtami Kavratka - retire early in the morning
 - iske baad mandap ke neeche mandal banaakar uske madhyabhaag main mitti yaa tambe kaa kalash sthapit karen
 Place a copper vessel on the urn
 - ab is paatr par vastrabhushan se susajjitradhaji kii murti sthapit karen
 - After this, worship Radhaji with hexoderm
 - dhyaan rahe ki puja kaa samay thik madhyahn kaa hona chahie
 - After the fast, complete fast or have a meal
 - duusare din shraddhanusaar suhaagin striyon tathaa brahmanon kobhojanakaraayen va unhen dakshina den

 Dawood ibrahimpm Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh said many times in their speech that underworld don Dawood Ibrahim will be brought to India soon

 aaj bhi hindustan kii adaalat daaud kaa intazaar kar rahi he
 Governments also cannot comfort that it is looking for Dawood
 kyonki afsos kii baat to ye he ki desh ke grih mantri ko pataa he ki daaud kaa thikaana kahaan he
 You have the right to condemn me kadi ninda kiijie
 But tell me what to do for those who have lost their loved ones in these blasts
 kya wo is baar bhi bas calendar badal kar itminan kar len
 You tell me
 ham maan lenge ki ye bhi jumala tha

 Hafiz Saeed did not get this Sajollywood film told that when Ghee comes out as a straight finger, it is only a matter of curbing it
 ab pakistan se ye ummid karnaa to saraasar ninsaphi hogi ki wo apane is trump card ko us jurm ke liye sazaa de jo usne hindustan main kiya

 He also announced a prize on Hafiz and tried to surround Pakistan in the UN but China came in the way repeatedly
 ab alam ye he ki hafiz said pakistan main naa sirf azaad gum rahaa he balki chunaavon main apni party ko bhi ladaa rahaa he
 Of course, the bailout of Hafiz's prisoners has been confiscated, but his efforts are showing that Pakistan's future is in danger and India as a neighbor must also be vigilant

 This time it has threatened the Government of India and Prime Minister Modi saying that if a temple is built in place of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, it will create havoc from Delhi to Kabul
 saath hi apane bayaan se usne ye bhi saaf kar diya he ki uske aatanki bharat main
 And in Kabul, he will target the Indian people and agencies
 bhartiya agenciyaan lagaataar masood azhar or uske gurgon par nazar banaae hue he magar is saal bhi uske haath khaali hi rah gaye
 No improvement in relations with Pakistan In the last 70 years, how many governments came across the border
 or gayi magar bharat paak rishton kaa meter hameshaa kii tarah is saal bhi upar neeche hi hota rahaa he
 Although the year 2018 proved to be somewhat of a rift in the relations between India and Pakistan, it also left a question mark on some of the issues
 beete saalon main beshak donon deshon main aatankwaad ko lekar khatas or tanaav badhata rahaa lekin paak main piemail-en or pipipi kaa varchasv todakar, cricket kii duniya se raajnneeti main aae imran khan ne satta sambhalate hi bharat ke saath sambandh sudhaarney kii pahal karte hue kartarpur galiyara khol diya
 But the infiltration of terrorists in the valley and the army of stone-backed Pakistanis brought these improving relations back there
 saath hi bharat ke sabase bade dushman hafiz said or masood azhar ke saamne ghutane tekkar imran sarkaar ne bharat sarkaar kii naaraazgi mol le lee he
 Baghdadi is still alive

 rus ne daawa zarur kiya ki uske hawaii hamale main bagdadi or uske khaas ladaake maare gaye magar naa to america ne or naa hi duniya ne ye mana ki sachmuch bagdadi ab is duniya main nahin he
 Yes, there is a news that the remaining terrorists of Baghdadi have taken shelter in the African country of Somalia and they are making a blast to build their organization there
 magar is silsile main ab tak pukhta report kaa intazaar he

 One who took the pic should also explain if there was any impact on the flight or passengers to raise this issue
 This is just to gain publicity
 This is the kind of boss i would like to work for / with

 aksar aisa hota he ki hamen koi aisi cheez pasand aa jaati he jise turant khareednaa hamaare bajet se baahar hota he
 At such a time, we have a credit card with which we buy anything we want even when there is no cash and if there is a payment within the grace period then there is no loss of interest
 iskaa sabase bada phayda yahi he ki pement aapke bank khate se turant nahin katati he jabaki debit card se turant cat jaati he
 But do you know that if you do not take care of some things then you may have to suffer a lot of loss
 1
 You must have often seen that whenever the balance in your account comes down from the minimum, then the message is displayed on the mobile 
 lekin credit ke bill ko jamaa karne ke liye aapke paas koi massej nahin atackyonki company chaahati hi nahin heki aap pehle maheene main hi sara pement kar den
 Rather companies want you to lie down and pay late fees later
 2
 Customers are often promised emis at zero percent on a free EMI credit card
 lekin aapako ye jaanakar hairaani hogi ki jiro pratishat byaaj paraiemai par niyam evam sharten lagu hoti hai
 If you violate any of the conditions, more than 20 percent interest can be paid, not 5 or 10
 3
 The bank never tells you by itself how you can redeem your points
 aise main jaankaree na hone se lakhon points pade rah jate hai or credit card expire ho jaataa he
 Apart from this, when your points cross landmarks like 1000 to 10,000 then the bank does not tell you that you have got so many points and you can redeem them and get cashback benefits
 4
 Banks often offer you that you can upgrade your free of cost silver to gold and gold to platinum, but do not say that you will have to pay a fee of Rs 500 to Rs 700 for a new credit card
 5
 Credit card holders often get a call that the credit limit of your credit card is being increased for free, but the bank never tells you that your annual fee will increase after that
 dilli main 2013 kii karaari haar ke baad congress noummid ho chuki thi
 The niche command handed over the Delhi election command to Ajay Maken as an impeccable leader
 maakan ko project kiye jane se unki team itani utsahit hui ki prachaar se pehle hi unhone unke liye ek victory spich bhi taiyaar kar lee
 a copy of it was found near his house along with old magazines and trash newspapers
 jo hamen uplabdh karai gai
 Interestingly, the print out of the speech was taken on 14 December 2014
 congress ko eggzet pole main paanch se bhi kam siten di gai hai, lekin phir bhi maakan ke liye taiyaar is bhaashan par ek najar daalana to banataa he naa-bhaiyon
 
 bahanon
 
 
 My elders and all my colleagues
 aaj dilli ne ye sabit kar diya ki wo apano par hi bharosa karti he
 My victory, my party's victory
 
 You win dilli waalon kii jeet he
 Every religion, every class of people is a victory
 14 maheene pehle jo gussa dilli waalon ne dikhaaya tha use pyaar or aashirwad banaakar hamen waapas kar diya
 Once again, thank you very much to the entire Delhi for trusting the Congress party
 main aapkaa aabhaar jataana chahta hoon
 And also of my own party which entrusted me with this responsibility for Delhi
 dhanyavad karnaa chahta hoon congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ji or upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ji kaa
 Understanding my service and love of Delhi people gave me this important mission
 aapane meri party or mere parivaar ke kaam ko ek baar phir se izzat di iske liye phir se dilli waalon kaa or sadar bazaar vidhansabha ke sabhi votaron kaa dhanyavad
 i still remember the day when in 1993, for the first time at the age of 28, the party sent me a ticket from Rajouri Garden to serve you
 or bharosa dikhaate hue dilli waalon ne mujhe 3000 voton se jitakar pehali baar vidhansabha main bheja tha
 The love of the people of Delhi continued to grow and again the people of Rajouri Garden made me an MLA in 1998 by winning 18 thousand votes
 yahi nahin 2003 main bhi dilli kii janata ne mujhe pyaar diya or 24 hajaar voton se jeet dilaai
 Brothers
 
 
 jab party alaakaman ne 2004 main mujhe nai dilli se jagmohan ke khilaaf loksabhaa chunaav main utaara to isi dilli ne mujhe 15 hajaar voton se jeet dilaakar sansad main bheja
 After this the Delhiites again won me the 2009 Lok Sabha elections with 1 lakh 90 bajar votes
 or aaj phir se sadar bazaar vidhansabha seat se mujhe jeetaakar apana pyaar or arshivaad diya
 i will give this love and blessing with my work and service
 mujhe khushi he is baat kii ki dilli kii janata ne jhuthe vaadon ko nakaar diya
 Communal forces gave a befitting reply
 maidan chhod kar bhaag jane waalon ko parajeet kar diya
 Delhiites know what the talkers and promises are doing
 bijepi kii kendra sarkaar kya kar rahi he ye bhi janata ke saamne tha
 Delhiites have proved that they are not with the liars and politics of religion but with those who do politics of development and truth
 main aapako bataanaa chahta hoon, hamaari congress party kii sarkaar ne pehle bhi pandraa saalon main jo kaam dilli main kiye wo kisi se chhipe nahin hai
 Whether it was about roads or the work of building flyovers, all our government had done to develop Delhi
 or ab congress kii ye nai sarkaar bhi apni vikaas yatra ko jari rakhegi
 i promise that we will rectify our mistakes, due to which we had to face defeat in the last election
 bhaiyon
 
 bahanon
 
 
 The promises made by the Congress party before this election in Delhi
 hamaari sarkaar agle 5 saalon main unhe puraa karne ke liye ji jaan se mehnat karegi
 You will remember that our previous government had done the task of making Delhi pollution free
 jab main dilli kaa transport mantri tha maine khud sienji project ke masaude ko taiyaar kiya tha
 Many people and opponents had said that this work is not possible but due to your blessings, i had done this work
 dilli kaa pradooshan kam kiya
 Our government will continue to do the same for the betterment of Delhi, for the development of Delhi
 bijli pani kii samasya ho yaa jhuggiyon main rahane waalon kii pareshaani, hamen sabakaa ahsaas he
 We will work together to solve this
 bhaiyon
 
 
 Sisters
 
 
 hamaara makasad dilli ko bhrashtachar mukt sarkaar dena he
 Your cooperation is needed in this
 bhrashtachar kii jahaan se bhi shikaayat aegi, sarkaar kade kadam uthaaegi
 And i want to say in the end that i moved forward the relationship with Delhi, Lalit Maken, so you gave me love and blessings
 or main is sarkaar ke madhyam se hamaare rishte ko or majboot karne kaa kaam karungaa
 i thank you all
 
 
 party kaa or mananeey sonia ji or rahul ji kaa is vishwaas ke liye
 i hope all of you will get love in this way and we will write a new story of development and progress of Delhi
 jai hind, jai bharat

 When you hear the name - # kareenakapoorkhan, you know that she was born a star
 The beauty has graced Filmfare covers many times but this time it’s all the more different and special since the country’s favourite now has an adorable son, Taimur Ali Khan
 And boy, Kareena is looking hotter than ever in this photo shoot
 She has nailed every look with such ease and elan – and this time around the icon is looking like an ultimate seductress with her bold kohl eyes
 Kareena Kapoor Khan is not only a talented actor but also a fashion icon and that's the reason we picked her to be the cover star of our annual fashion issue
 High on style and oomph, these are Kareena's best pictures till date

 History will call Modi for this as job destruction PM
 jairam ramesh ne patrakaron vaarta main kaha ki piem ko koi haq nahin he jhooth bolne kaa
 The PM repeatedly says that during his tenure, employment was recorded
 jabaki pichley saal ek karod log berozegaar hue hai, notebandi or jiesti kii vajah se
 He said that on 16 November 2018, PM Modi said that under the Mudra scheme, each one provided employment to 4-5 people
 24 navvember 2018 ko piem ne chhatarpur main kaha ki aaj desh me 25 karod pariwaron ko mudra pariyojna se laabh mila
 He said that under 90 percent Mudra Yojana, the assistance amount is 25 thousand rupees on an average
 isamen kya rojgaar khadey ho sakate hai
 If out of 25 thousand rupees a person can give employment to 3-4 people
 mudra yojana ke tahat teen kism main lone die jate hai
 Tarun and Kishore categories can be included in employment generation, whereas the government itself says that 90 percent loan category was under Shishu
 yah baat 1999 kii he
 Then 29-year-old Rahul Gandhi was present with his mother Sonia Gandhi at a rally in Hisar in Haryana
 party ke kai netaa manch par baithe the, lekin rahul kisi tamashbin kii tarah khadey the or raily ke puure maahaul ko samajhane kii koshish kar rahe the
 During the rally itself, she pulled a white plastic chair from the crowd towards the stage and raised it towards Congress Legislature Party leader Kartari Devi as she stood on the stage
 gandhi vansh ke is vaaris ke swabhaav main sahanubhuti kii bhaavana bhari hui he, jo varshon ke unke saarvajanik jivan main dikhaai detii he, lekin netaa ke taur par unka vyaktitv kamjor dikhaai detaa he
 In a recent interview given to the fiery journalist Arnab Goswami, Congress Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi answered most of the questions directly
 lekin ve bilkul anubhavheen najar aae
 He did not seem to have any status in that interview, nor was there any shrewdness to take the interview in his own direction - while all these qualities are very important for the personality of an important politician
 sonia gandhi kii jeevani likhane vaale rashid kidawai kehete hai, ''brands rahul kya he? yah bilkul spasht nahin he
 Kidwai was present at that rally in Haryana and has been closely watching Rahul's journey as a leader
 lekin ek samvaad visheshgy kii raay alag he
 They do not agree with this general opinion about Rahul that he seems a novice in front of the public
 unka kahana he, ''aamane-saamne kii baatcheet main ve bahut sachet najar aate hai
 "A brand consultant from Delhi says that Rahul fully welcomes new ideas
 unke vichaar ho saktaa he, li se hatakar hon, lekin suvichaarit hote hai
 Those who have worked with Rahul believe that there are many layers to his personality
 rahul ke vigyapanon ko bahut-se brands visheshgyon ne yah kahkar khaarij kar diya he ki ve aadhe-adhure, nirarthak, bikhare hue or der se taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 500 crores on these
 kharch kiye jane kii baat bataai ja rahi he
 Dilip Cherian, founder and image manager of Perfect Relations, says, "they have portrayed the youth image well, but that's not enough
" ”ek anya samvaad visheshgy santosh desai kehete hai ki brands vah idia hota he, jo aap dete hai or ''jo maanviya str par logon ko jodta he
 "rahul Gandhi is trying to present himself as a leader who is imagining a new kind of politics, a grassroots leader, a leader of women and youth
 futurebrands india ke managing diarector or siio desai kehete hai, ''unke vigyapanon main ye bindu prabhaavshaalee dhang se ubharkar nahin aa rahe hai
 Their publicity appears contextual
 ”modi ke mukaable kahaan hai rahulkoi brands khadaa karne ke liye jo buniyadi kaam hona chahie, vah bhi 7 april se shuru hone vaale aam chunaavon ko dekhte hue rahul ke maamle main nahin hua he
 His campaign started in December 2013 while Modi's campaign had gained momentum by that time
 vanshavaad par tiki party main koi bhi rahul ko sahi salaah dene kii himmat nahin karata
 Perhaps this happened even before the hour-long interview given to Goswami
 party main kai log khulkar sweekaar karte hai ki intervyuu dena baari galati thi
 "it was a big mistake to give an 80-minute interview at such an important time," says Desai
 ise chota or prabhaavshaalee bananaa chahie tha
 "rahul's boil in between seems inconsistent and sometimes childish
 chaahe vah doshi saansadon ko bachaane vaale vidheyak ko bakawaas bataakar sabake saamne phadqa ho yaa adhyadesh ke jariye bhrashtachar virdohi kanoon bananaa, in sab harkaton se unki anubhavheenata hi jhalkati he
 It was a good opportunity for the Congress to take advantage of the Jan Lokpal Bill movement
 desai kehete hai, ''unhen yah avasar thali main paroskar pesh kiya gaya tha
 But they were too late to take advantage of it
 ”modi se tulana karen to gujarat main ek prashaasak ke taur par modi kaa pichhlaa record acha rahaa he, rahul ke paas pichley 10 saal main apana kaam dikhaane ke liye kuch bhi nahin he, sivaa un badlaavon ke jo unhone yuva congress main kiye hai
 Kidwai says, "he has no success story
" ” unka kahana he ki rahul ke pita divangat rajeev gandhi ''jab pradhanmantri bane the to ve rahul se kam umr ke the
 Was the father of two children and was a working man
 haalanki shuru main ve jimmedaari sanbhaalane se hichak rahe the, lekin jimmedaari lene ke baad apane kaam main puri tarah jute gaye the
 "rahul's absence in the party office and his occasional appearance in Parliament debates does not augur well for the party's young cadres
 takneekee ko pasand karne vaale rahul soshal media par bilkul sakriy nahin hai
 When the organization named 'friends of Congress' requested him to come on Twitter, he also ignored it
 aisa karke unhone un avasaron ko gavaan diya he, jinke jariye ve matadaataaon ko apane vichaaron kii jhalak de sakate the
 In marketing, Kejriwal Agarwind Kejriwal cleverly created the brand of Aam Aadmi Party
 unhone ekadam shunya se apni shuruyaat karke ek saal main yah kamyaabi hasil kii he
 Desai says, "it is a powerful idea that is affecting everyone, whether it is the party's election symbol sweep or its cap
" ”kejariwal tasveeron main paseene se tar-batar najar aate hai, jo is baat kaa sandesh detaa he ki ve kaam karne vaale aadmi hai
 Modi appears to be a strong ruler in the pictures, while Rahul appears confused
 ve apni 'baba’ (amir or prabhaavshaalee ghar kaa baccha) chhavi dur karne main safal nahin hue hai
 Rahul is holding small meetings with porters, women, rickshaw-pullers and students
 ve yah dikhaanaa chaahate hai ki ve manch par baithkar bolne vaale netaa nahin hai, balki logon ke bich rahanaa chaahate hai
 His strategy of projecting himself as a leader who is away from power does not seem right to those who know the brand
 rahul kaa brands taiyaar karne main sabase badi samasya unka antarmukhi hona he
 Cherian of Perfect Relations says, "rahul is very lonely by nature
 ve apane kuch kareebi logon ke saath khulkar baaten karte hai
 But the number of such close people is very less
 ”iske vipareet modi ne unhen chaay par charchaa kaa brands de diya he or bharatiyon kii chaay pine kii aadat kaa phayda uthaaya he
 Through this discussion, they are also cleverly showing how this BJP leader has risen from a tea seller to this height
 congress ke bhitari sutara bataate hai ki rahul or party ke prachaar ke agle charan main vishesh virgon ko lakshya banaaya jayega
 But till then, the brand is going to be stuck in the vortex of Rahul heritage and confusion
 eskee adwisers ke chairman sunil alag kehete hai, ''rahul gandhi aisa product hai, jo yah kah rahaa he ki abhi main aranddy kii prakriya main hum
 Modi is a tea-biscuit man, a part of our daily lives
 rahul gandhi chocolate biscuit brands hai, or aaj mujhe chocolate kii jarurat nahin he
 " afghanistan ke shahar majaar-e-sharif main bhartiya vaanijya duutavas ke baahar aatankiyon ke saath chali muthbhed aakhirkaar somvaar kii raat khatm ho gai

 Some reports said that one of the attackers was caught alive, but no confirmation could be made
 aatankiyon kii galati kaa phaaydasarkari sutron ne bataaya ki aatankwaadiyon me duutavas se 100 meter kii duuri par sthit ek marij haul se hamalaa kiya tha
 Their target was the embassy but the terrorists accidentally attacked a nearby floor
 iske chalate ITBP commando ne aatankwaadiyon par javaabi karrwai shuru kar di
 Earlier official sources said that special combat units of the Afghan National Police recovered three bodies from outside the Indian consulate

 Security forces rescued the Indian consulate at around 12 pm
