 rahul ne yah bhi kaha ki sammelan main hissaa lene vaale vidwaanon, buddhijiviyon or itihaaskaaron main galat dharna he ki aresas ne congress ko haraaya he
 He said, 'we are seeing this as a victory of the RSS somewhere
 ham ise dekh rahe hai ki aresas ne hamen haraaya he
 this is wrong
 aresas nahin jaanati he
 
 
 What she is going to face in the coming weeks, months and years
 ' Trying to reach progressive intellectuals and scholars, he said that it is the Congress and their need to re-establish relations and discuss the ideas that are going to help the party defeat the RSS
 ' unhone kaha, 'vastav main aap main or hamamen koi bhed nahin he
 
 
 There is a false barrier between us
 
 
 yahaan hamaare kai mitron ne kaha ki kyon congress ne aisa nahin kiya or kyon congress ne vaisaa nahin kiya

 congress satta ke sameekaran se nipatane ko majaboor he or yah kai chizon ko badal detaa he
 
 
 i cannot shut my eyes to the idea of power

 ' Congress leader Kapil Sibal says that the Bharatiya Janata Party is doing politics on the action of the Air Force in Balakot
 unhone kaha ki rashtriya suraksha ko raajnneeti se dur rakhane kii jarurat he
 But the BJP always gives priority to such issues
 or phir jab koi unase sawaal kare to wo deshadrohi ban jaataa he
 Kapil Sibal said that a strong leader means that the country should go with him
 lekin is sarkaar ne hameshaa desh ko vibhajit karne kii koshish kii he
 He said what did this government do after the terrorist attacks took place between 2014 and 2018? Now all that is happening is because of elections
 jahaan tak congress kii baat he to hamaari party ne aatankwaad se ladate-ladate qurbaani bhi di he
 If Kapil Sibal believes that the Air Strike Air Force did, what is the contribution of the government in this
 wing commander abhinandan kii photo choti, modi ji kii photo badi hoti ja rahi he, ye raajnneeti nahin to kya he
 He said that the foreign policy of the Modi government has flopped
 aaj china hamen gheraa hua he
 The china-pakistan Corridor is growing
 myanmar or srilanka main china kaa dakhal bad rahaa he
 America is also not supporting us and Russia is talking to Pakistan
 modi sarkaar bataae ki koun padosi desh hamaare saath he
 Kapil Sibal said, 'sushma Swaraj goes to the meeting of Islamic countries and the resolution is passed against us, what kind of foreign policy is this
 'rashtriya suraksha ke mudde par sibbal ne kaha, 'sena ke paas hathiyaar or gola barood puraane ho chuke hai
 But what did the government do? On the Kashmir issue, Sibal said that there were 2936 ceasefire violations in 2018-19
 jab bhi kashmir main halaat sudharne lagate hai tab anuchhed 370, anuchhed 35-e kii baat hone lagati he
 Politics starts happening
 'congress netaa kapil sibbal ne kaha ki agar sawaal poochna deshadroh he to main deshadrohi hum
 He said that at the time of World War II, a no-confidence motion had come against Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill
 kya wo deshadrohi the?apane bayaan main congress netaa ne kaha ki yah naa to muscular or naa hi majboot sarkaar he
 No concrete decision has been taken
 majboot netaa ne 15 lakh rupee khate main daalane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin kya puraa hua
 He said that the Pulwama attack is the result of intelligence failure
 vahaan par RDX kaise pahunchaa? aakhir main unhone kaha ki rashtriya suraksha ko lekar aam sahmati banani chahie

 aam aadmi party sarkaar 30 sitambar ko vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaane ja rahi he
 Like many occasions in this session too, the Chief Minister, Ministers and mlas will be seen speaking out against the Central Government
 upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne bataaya ki shuukravaar ko vidhansabha kaa vishesh satr bulaayaa gaya he
 The session will discuss the cases registered against dengue, chikungunya and the Delhi government chief minister
 mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twit ke jariye bataaya ki wo shuukravaar kodilli vidhansabhake ek din ke vishesh satr ke dauraan aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon, mantriyon or apane khilaaf jhuthe maamle darj kiye jane ke peeche ek 'bahut bade shadyantra' kaa khulaasa karenge
 CM took to Twitter to write, 'false cases against AAP mlas and Ministers, FIR against me, why CBI raids? This is a big conspiracy
 ham shuukravaar ko dilli vidhansabha main iskaa khulaasa karenge
 In the meantime, the issue of Satyendra Jain trapped in the income tax probe will be raised in the Assembly
 shuukravaar kii subah chunauti dete hue satyendra jain ne bhi elaan kiya tha ki mukhyamantri bada khulaasa karenge
 In fact, one of the major reasons for convening the assembly session is the name of the Chief Minister in the FIR lodged by the Delhi Corruption Branch for alleged disturbances in the Delhi Women's Commission
 haalanki, asibi pehle hi saaf kar chuki he ki iem arvind kejariwal se poochtacha nahin kii jaaegi
 The Chief Minister had alleged that an FIR was lodged against him at the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ek taraf desh kii rajdhani dengue,chikanguniyaake prakope or gandagi se jujh rahi he
 At the same time, the question arises that instead of raising the issues of the people of Delhi, what is the right step to target the opponents from the assembly? Or how will this concern the Delhiites? Although dengue and chikungunya are to be discussed in the assembly, there is also a plan to surround the MCD
 lekin aise vakt par jab bimariyon se rokthaam or taiyaariyon ko lekar kejariwal sarkaar pehle hi sawaalon ke ghere main he

 The pain and feeling of loss has come down while telling the bitter story of oppression on the face of 78-year-old Mohammad Surti, who was the port minister of Gujarat in the eighties
 apane do manjila ghar main makka kii tasviir ke saamne baithe suurati kabhi congress ke kaddavar netaa the
 He was named among the 11 accused in the conspiracy of two bomb blasts in Surat in 1993, after the riots broke out after the demolition of Babri Masjid
 2008 main tada adaalat ne inhen jail kii sajaa sunai thi
 In 1995, he was convicted of that crime
 19 saal kii adalati karrwai or 12 saal tak jail main rahane ke baad supreme court ne 18 july ko unhen bari kar diya
 Of course they are happy that they proved innocent, but some questions are churning their mind
 "who will return our 12 years? For the past two decades, we and our family were facing the stigma of being terrorists, now who will erase its marks? ‚Äù Can law and order assure that at least the court proceedings related to such serious cases are not prolonged? Two bomb blasts, long term conviction and acquittal after a long time, This is a heartbreaking story
 isaki bhoomika 1993 main hi ban gai thi, jab 28 janvari kii subah vaarcha road ilaake main ek bam visphot hua
 An eight-year-old student died and 11 people were injured
 22 april ko surat railway stesan par ek or dhamaakaa hua
 38 people were injured in this
 ye visphot babari masjid dhahaae jane ke baad mumbai or surat main bhadke un dangon ke jawaab main the jinamein shahar ke vaarcha road or veda road ilaakon main dangaiyon ne kareeb 200 musalamaanon kii hatya kar di thi
 These riots had endured Muslims more than ever
 vaarcha road visphot maamle main police ne ghatana ke kuch hi din ke bheetar 27 logon ko giraftaar kiya tha, lekin sakshya ke abhaav main un sabhi ko tada adaalat ne do saal baad bari kar diya
 In the same year, the police arrested 11 others in connection with the railway station blast case and made them accused in the Warchha Road case
 gaur talab he ki inamen se koi bhi aaropee kareeb do saal pehle hue dhamaakon kii jagah par nahin pakadaa gaya tha
 Both cases were later imposed and confessional statements were presented of all the 11 accused, who were allegedly subjected to third degree torture by the police
 2001 main supreme court ne sabhi aropiyon ko jamaanat de di thi, lekin gujarat kii tada adaalat ne 2008 main unhen doshi tehraate hue 10 se 20 saal kii jail kii sajaa sunai
 Each of them had spent at least 12 years in prison until acquitted on 18 July
 52 varshiya mushtak patel ko railway stesan visphot maamle main sabase pehle giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 They ask, "why did it take two years for the police to arrest us while we were local residents, not outsiders?" Many of us were Congress leaders and activists
 jaahir he, police apane nae bijepi aakaaon ko khush karne kii kavayad main lagi thi
 On March 14, 1995, immediately after Keshubhai Patel was sworn in as Chief Minister, all but me were arrested
 ‚Äùbari vyaktiyon main se ek kaa kahana he ki asli aparaadhiyon ko police nahin pakad saki or bhugatna unhen padaa
 "all the people arrested by the police in this case were innocent and the police failed to apprehend the real culprits," he says
 hamaare khilaaf daayar vaarcha road maamla bhi puri tarah se galat tha
 "the other person says that 90 per cent of the cases were wrong
 haalanki jab usase poocha gaya ki baaki 10 fisadi sahi maamalon kaa kya to vah khamosh rahaa
 Hussain Ghadiyali, a 64-year-old businessman and farmer, is sitting in his simple eight-storey apartment in Surat with grandchildren and telling us, "we were being tortured with inhuman third degree for forcing confessions
" mere donon pairon ke talave lathi kii lagaataar maar se kaale pad gaye the
 In such circumstances we had to confess
 ‚Äù bari kiye gaye sabhi 11 aropiyon ke bachaav paksh ke vakil mushtak shaikh kehete hai ki shuru se hi is maamle ko rajnatik rang diya ja rahaa tha
 "the police keep secret the action of any matter related to national security and communal peace until the final conclusions are reached
" is tarah kii jaanch rashtriya kartavya kii bhaavana ke saath kii jaani chahie
 But during the investigation in this case, the police continued to issue some press note inciting communal sentiments every day
 ‚Äùsuurati kehete hai, ''police kii ore se maamle ke bare main jari kii gai managasaint jaankariyon ko sthaneey bhashaa ke dainik akhbaar or bhi sansanikhej banaakar paroste rahe or hamen media trial kaa bhi shikaar hona padaa
 When Patel was arrested for illegally possessing a revolver, he was vacationing with his family on a beach near Surat
 yah 12 march, 1995 kii ghatana he
 Just a day after that, the BJP government took power in Gandhinagar
 kuch dinon baad, unhen railway visphot maamle main aaropee bana diya gaya tha
 The next arrests were of Surti and Ghadiyal
 (rihaai ke baad apane pote ke saath hossain ghadiyaali)police ke hisaab se ghatnaon kaa kram is prakaar rahaa- babari masjid ke dhahne ke baad surat samet kai jagahon par hue dangon main musalmaan khud ko kaaphi asurakshit mahasoos kar rahe the
 The accused therefore planned to gather arms for self-protection and revenge from the majority community
 police ne kaha ki aropiyon main se ek ikbaal vadiwala‚Äîghadiyaali or unki patni shamima suurati se milane gaye, jo us samay gujarat rajya matsay vikaas board ke adhyaksh the
 According to the police, he arranged for six foreign grenades, two AK-47 rifles and 199 live cartridges from Abdul Latif in Ahmedabad
 unheen hathgolon kaa istemaal donon visphoton main kiya gaya
 According to the police, Surti came to Surat from Ahmedabad in his government car and Wadiwala followed him with a landmine in a Maruti van
 ek congress kaaryakarta or chote bhoomi-dalal rahe mushtak ko jail main achche aacharan ke liye praaanpatr diya gaya he
 The jail superintendent had noticed how promptly Mushtaq used to prepare for religious ceremonies organized for prisoners
 2008 main jab tada adaalat ne unhen doshi tehraaya to adaalat main sirf unke muslim dost nahin, balki sabhi ro pade the
 Says Mushtaq, "when i was arrested in 1995, my son Minhaj, who is currently doing LLB, was just two years old
 mere dost or rishtedaar madad ke liye khadey rahe, tabhi vah apni shiksha hasil kar rahaa he
 But more than my personal family suffering, i am shocked to see the shouts of my Hindu brothers spilling for me
 bas thodaa sa yahi sukun he ki unke bich kai log aise bhi hai, jo jaanate hai ki main nirdosh hum
 Wadiwala, a Congress leader and member of Surat Municipal Corporation Education Committee, had to go to jail twice
 isi bich unke parivaar kaa mitti ke tel or hotel kaa kaarobaar puri tarah barbaad ho gaya
 He also died due to liver disease in 2013
 unki patni jubeda or 39 or 36 varshiya bete aabid or wasim surat ke najadik ek chota-sa restaraan chalaate hai
 There is frustration on his face
 aabid kehete hai, ''jail main uchit ilaaj nahin hone kii vajah se mere walid kii maut ho gai
 Surti's 40-year-old son Amin alleged that his fisheries business was ruined by the powerful people of the BJP government after the arrest of his father in 1995
 unke saath hua anyaay sirf abhiyukt ke taur par unke jail jane tak hi simit nahin rahaa, balki isamen unke pariwaron ko bhi pisna padaa jinhen saal dar saal aarthik abhaavon or saamaajik upeksha, jalaalat or duusari takalifon kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 is praavdhaan main tada ke tahat dandaneey aparaadh ke bare main kisi bhi jaankaree kii recording ke liye jila police adheekshak kii manjuuri honi chahie
 But for recording the statements confessing to the crime by the accused, the Gujarat Police took the approval of the Additional Chief Secretary of the State Home Department
 adaalat ke saamne sawaal yah tha ki kya jila police adheekshak ko praapt manjuuri kaa adhikaar rajya ke kisi anya adhikari ko bhi hasil he
 In this case, the Chief Secretary is an officer of the highest level
 adaalat ne nahin main jawaab diya
 He ruled that if a rule is made, it should be followed in the same manner
 ''us kaam ko kisi bhi duusari tarah se karne kii manaahi honi chahie
 "while it may seem right to go to a senior officer for approval, the court while citing some earlier cases said that if the law gives some discretionary authority to an officer, then that authority is exercised by another officer
" is wrong
 ‚Äúis maamle main kanoon kahata he, ''adaalatein is siddhant ko lagu karne ke prati itani sakht hai ki ve un prashasnic daleelon kii bhatrsana karti he, jo unhen banane waalon ko swaabhaavik or uchit maaloom hoti hai
 After the confession recorded under TADA became invalid, the case of the Gujarat government had no merit

 Special Public Prosecutor Hansmukh Lalwala had presented arguments in the TADA court against the accused

 The Indian tour of the Australian cricket team always gathers headlines
 pehle kii kangaroo team ko puure vishwa main jeet darj karne ke baad bhi bharat main bamushkil hi jeet milti thi or is baar to yah puraani, australian team kii tarah majboot bhi najar nahin aa rahi
 The Australian team has not been able to win a match in India since the 2004 series win, but that does not mean that there has been any change in the behavior of this team
 vipakshi team ke ahm khilaadiyon ko target karnaa, series se pehle hi mind games khelnaa or manovaigyanik dabaav banane kii australian team kii ranneeti abhi bhi jari he
 In 2007-08, coach John Buchanan designed Operation 'get Tendulkar' for Ricky Ponting's team
 unke mutabik sachin kaa futwork dhimaa ho gaya tha jisase unhen short pich gendbaazi khilne main dikkat pesh aati or unhen jaldi out kiya ja saktaa tha
 At the end of the series, Sachin was the highest run-scorer with these figures (4 matches, 8 innings, 493 runs, 70 runs
 42 ausat, 2 shatak 2 ardhashatak)
 Such a plan was not made once, again and again, sometimes through Shane Warne and sometimes Glenn mcgrath
 
 But Sachin's record was the best against Australia
 sachin ke baad ab fokas bharat ke do sabase bade match vinurs par he
 These are Captain Virat Kohli and R
 aswin
 According to Mike Hussey, former cricketer known as 'mr Cricket' in Australia, Mitchell Starc can stop Virat Kohli
 hasi ne kaha ki stark ke paas swing he, reverse he, raftaar he jisase ve kohli ko puri series main pareshaan kar sakate hai
 The comments team ke captain captain steve smith pehle hi apane khilaadiyon ko sledging kii anumati de chuke hai
 Knowing and understanding that in the previous series, there has been a lot of sledding between Virat and Mitchell Johnson and David Warner
 nateeja ye rahaa ki 2014-15 ke us australian daure par viraat ne 4 maichon main 86
 Scored 692 runs at an average of 50 (4 centuries, 1 half-century) match bhartiya zameen par hai
 In such a situation, Ashwin becomes India's number one match winner and for him the Kangaroo team is ready before the series
 david warner ne kaha he aswin ko unki ballebaazi ke hisaab se apni gendbaazi main badlaav karne honge jis tarah bhartiya zameen par unhen khilne ke liye khud warner ko badlaav karne pade hai
 But they are completely ready for Ashwin
 unka gemplain ready he aswin 2011 main apane debyue ke baad se vishwa cricket main sabase zyada wicket lene vaale khilaadi hai
 Despite all this, former Australian captain Steve Waugh said that if Sourav Ganguly thinks that this time like the previous series will be a 'clean sweep' then he is very optimistic
 matlab kangaroo team kaa mindgames khelnaa jari he, lekin iskaa asar maidan par utarane ke baad hi pataa chalegaa

 The captain of the team, Steve Smith, has already given his players permission for sledging
 ye jaanate or samajhate hue ki pichhali series main viraat or michel johnson or david warner ke bich kaafii sledging ho chuki he
 As a result, Virat played 86 matches in 4 matches on that Australian tour of 2014-15
 50 kii ausat se 692 ran bana daale (4 shatak, 1 ardhashatak) The matches are on Indian soil
 aise main aswin bharat ke number van match vinar ban jate hai or unke liye bhi kangaroo team series se pehle hi taiyaar he
 David Warner has said that Ashwin will have to change his bowling according to his batting, the way Warner himself has to make changes to play on Indian soil
 lekin ve aswin ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar hai
 His gameplan is Ready
 Ashwin is the highest wicket-taker in world cricket since his 2011 debut
 is sabake baavjood purv australian captain steve wa ne kaha ki saurav ganguli agar ye sochate hai ki pichhali series kii tarah is baar bhi 'clin sweep' hoga to wo bahut ashaavadi hai
 Meaning the kangaroo team's mind games continue to play, but its effect will be known only after landing on the field
 match bhartiya zameen par hai
 In such a situation, Ashwin becomes India's number one match winner and for him the Kangaroo team is ready before the series
 david warner ne kaha he aswin ko unki ballebaazi ke hisaab se apni gendbaazi main badlaav karne honge jis tarah bhartiya zameen par unhen khilne ke liye khud warner ko badlaav karne pade hai

 pehle goliyaan chalaayin phir rocket bhi daaga
 But the target missed
 bas par hand grenade se bhi hamalaa kiya gaya, lekin grenade fatne ke pehle bas uske upar se guzar kar paar ho gai

 gyanpith puraskaar se sammanit marathi lekhak or kavi bhalchandra nemaade saahitiyik galiyaaron main aajkal charchaa main hai
 Nemade, who has been known for the English protests, once again criticized Salman Rushdie and VS Noypal, and Rushdie's tweet on Twitter made a lot of headlines
 ajtak ke saath intervyuu main bhalchandra nemaade ne salmaan rushdi ke saath vivaad par to kuch nahin kaha, lekin ek nae raaj se pardaa uthaa diya
 Here is a conversation with Bhalchandra Nemade about literature, awards, politics and his book 'hindu: The rich junk of life'
 
 Question: Honors like the Jnanpith Award give the writer a new identity
 kya main sahi kah rahaa hum?javabalpani apni bhashaa main to pehle hi pahchaan hoti he, jo buniyadi taur zyada moolyawaan hoti he
 But if readership increases in other languages then it is a matter of great pleasure for the writer
 is tarah lekhak ke vichaar ko vistaar miltaa he or saath hi pahchaan bhi
 Question: You have been creative for a long time
 aapako sahitya academy bahut pehle mil gaya or gyanpith puraskaar ab jaakar mila he
 Although controversies started with the receipt of Jnanpith, what would you say about the politics and controversy of these awards? Answer: Any writer should always look at any award from a distance
 agar dene waalon ko laga ki ye kuch kaam kar rahaa he or mil gaya to thik he
 If not found, there is nothing worse than that
 apana kaam to chalata hi rahata he
 It has no effect on writing
 sawalagnanpith puraskaar milane ke baad aapane salmaan rushdi or vies noipal ke khilaaf kuch kaha or rushdi ne aapke khilaaf morcha khol diya?javabasalmaan rushdi ko maaloom nahin ki maine usko padhaayaa he
 i don't do anything, he was running another fair, he said something
 uske baad tabase bol rahaa he
 Question: In the current political and social situations, when the new meaning of the word 'hindu' is being coined
 aise main aapaki kitaab ‚Äòhindu‚Äô ko padhanaa kyon jaruri he
 Answer: It is time to understand the true meaning of Hindu concept
 hindu parampara kaa pracheen kaal se chalaa aa rahaa samaveshi swarup saamne aana chahie
 The Hindu tradition has continued with everyone
 hameshaa sabko acha kaha he, sabko saath liya or duniya main aisi kahi parampara nahin he
 That is why i want the 'hindu concept' to be interpreted
 sawalachetan bhagat jaise hindi ke kathith hitaishi hindi ko roman main likhe jane kii vakaalat kar rahe hai
 Answer: The question of script and language is very emotional
 main samajhataa hum hindi koi bahut kam darje kii bhashaa nahin he
 Hindi has a huge tradition
 bade-bade lekhak rahe hai, likhane or padhane waalon kii badi taadaad rahi or duniya kii shaayad teesri-chauthi badi bhashaa he
 Why change your script in Hindi? Why is it necessary to change the language of millions of people? This is not a practical thing and the Roman script is not very scientific
 sawalvahamaare pathakon ke liye ‚Äòhindu: jeene kaa samrudh kabad‚Äô ke bare main bataaen
 Answer: 'hindu: rich junk of life' is my third novel
 ye chaar khandon main he
 Four sections because in the first section i told the story of a rustic boy who becomes an archaeologist
 iske baad vaale khand main bhootkaal main apni samskruti kii rachana kaise badalati ai or uski swarachna kaise hui or ajtak isamen kaise badlaav aae or hamane kaise use apanaaya

 Like it happened in Canada, America and Australia
 yah ek bahut hi shashakt parampara rahi he or mujhe 'hindu' shabd kaa arth vishaal karnaa he
 Question: What will you say if Indians adopt English as their second language and do not read their languages? Answer: The challenge will be solved by shutting down English
 ham angreji puri tarah hataa nahin sakate, kyonki ham gulam rahe hai, to itani jaldi nahin jaaegi
 But countries like Japan, Korea and China study up to phd in their languages

 There is no need to depend on English
 is desh main angreji aane se pehle sab kaise chalata tha
 How did the Maratha Empire run, how did the vast Mughal Empire run
 sawalasskulon main german kii jagah sanskrit padhaane ke centre sarkaar ke faisle par jamkar vivaad hua or german kii jagah sanskrit ko nahin mili
 Answer: Our upper class and people sitting in power want to keep English
 inaki soch he ki agar ham angreji ko rakhenge to satta main rahenge
 Their thinking is that they are pastoral people, they do not know anything
 or jab tak ye log hai tab tak angreji jaaegi nahin
 In such a situation, unless the people revolt that we have to study in our language, it is not possible
 kyonki duniya main kahin bhi duusari bhashaa main padhane kii parampara nahin he
 We only have it here, because we have been slaves
 sawaldapani bhashaaon kii vakaalat karne par ek varg logon ko rashtravaadi kah detaa he
 He says that this country has been a Liberal and you should be a Liberal? Answer: These are mental distortions that what you own is distorted, call it nationalist and someone who knows English is a Liberal
 duniya ke bhashaa shaastra kehete hai ki sristi kaa akalan apni bhashaaon main hi sambhav he
 You need your language to think
 sawaalh‚Äòhindu‚Äô ke puraa hone ke baad aap sirf kavita likhane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Why this? Answer: They say not first love
 
 So this is my first love

 Our life has been associated with poetry
 chaahe mahilaon kaa anaaj peesna ho yaa kheti-kisaani, kavita hamaare jivan kaa abhinn ang rahi he
 My first writing has been poetry

 My wife does not even want to live in this flat

 desh me angadaan ko badhaava dene ke liye saal 2014 main neshnal argon and tishu transplant argenigeshan (NOTTO) gathan kiya gaya
 The aim is to make hospitals available organs for timely transplant
 lekin pichley 2 saalon main keval 12 maamalon main hi ang ek aspataal se duusare aspataal tak pahunch paae
 Even after having organs with hospitals, he is not able to reach the needy
 vyavastha main kami kii vajah se ang daan main kamidansal har rajyon main maujuud aspataalon ko chaahe vopublic ho yaa privetause transplant ko lekar NOTTO ko jaankaree deni hoti he
 But this is not happening
 desh main lagbhag 200 aise aspataal hai jahaan argon transplant yani ang pratyaropan ho rahaa he
 In the last 2 years, there are only 96 hospitals that have provided information related to organ donation and transplant to NOTTO
 baari sankhya main jaruratmandiske alaava bharat memongon kii demand or supplaike bich baari antar he
 According to the data obtained from NOTTO, about two lakh kidneys are needed every year in the country but only 6 thousand are available
 isi tarah 30 hajaar liver kii jarurat par keval 1500 liver mil pate hai
 Heart is in bad condition, the need is close to 50 thousand and only 15 can be found
 yahi nahin, netra daan kii baat karen to har saal lagbhag ek lakh carnia kii demand hoti he or puri keval 25 hajaar ho paati he
 The problem is that due to not getting the transplant done on time, there is no concrete arrangement from the hospital or the government for those who are aware and want to donate their family organs while dying
 har ang ko kuch ghante main transplant karnaa hota he nahin to wo bekaar ho jaataa he
 According to Shrikant Sharma, a medicine consultant at Moolchand Hospital, after transplanting the heart should be transplanted in 4-6 hours, liver in 12-15 hours, kidney in 24-48 hours and langus in 4-8 hours
 jaagarukta abhiyaan chalaane kii taiyaarivahin swasthya mahanideshak dow

 According to Prasad, every hospital in the country has been instructed to keep a transplant codinator at its center, which will be borne by the central government

 The ministry also said that the government believes that the ban on manufacture, sale and distribution of these drugs is necessary in the public interest

 The petition was filed by Rajiv Kumar's lawyer on Wednesday morning
 The CBI has prepared action against Rajiv Kumar
 The CBI had summoned Kumar for questioning on Saturday
 Former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajiv Kumar has received a big shock in the Saradha Chit Fund case
 
 uttar 24 pargana ke barasaat main kendriya anveshan beuro (sibiai) kii vishesh adaalat ne rajeev kumaar kii agrim jamaanat yachika sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya
 This petition was filed by Rajiv Kumar's lawyer on Wednesday morning
 court ne kaha ki yah hamaara adhikaar kshetra nahin he
 Rajiv Kumar was directed to file a petition in the District Judge Court
 rajeev kumaar ke vakil kii ore se uttar 24 pargana ke district seshan jaj kii adaalat main agrim jamaanat yachika daali gai he jis par mangalvaar ko sunwaayee ho sakati he
 On the other hand, sources are quoting that the CBI has prepared strict action against Rajiv Kumar
 bengal ke dijipi se kehane ke baad sibiai ne rajeev kumaar ke vakil se kaha he ki ve apane muvakkil ko hajir hone liye kahen
 In the last four days, 3 summons have been issued to Rajiv Kumar but Rajiv Kumar has not been present
 iske baad sibiai ne kadi karrwai karne kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 Major action can be taken against Rajiv Kumar by Tuesday afternoon
 sutron ne yah jaankaree di he
 a CRPF company will be deployed at the CBI office in Salt Lake for questioning, so that law and order problems can be avoided
 sibiai ne poochtacha ke liye kumaar ko shanivaar ko saman kiya tha
 This was done by the CBI after the Calcutta High Court withdrew its last protection from arrest
 court ne purv kolkata police ayukta ko sarada chit fund ghotaalaa maamle main giraftaar se sangrakshan diya tha
 The court granted interim protection to Kumar on May 30 and extended it several times
 sunakar hairaan ho gaye naa? lekin raajnneeti main kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Nitish Kumar, who was once a fierce rival of Laloo Prasad Yadav, can now hand over half the command of Bihar to his daughter
 ek angreji akhbaar ne patna se yah khabar di he
 It says that the ruling JD (U) and the RJD of the Laluqi Party are set to merge and this arrangement will happen after that
 akhbaar ke mutabik vartmaan mukhyamantri jithan ram maanjhi kaa hatana tay he or unki jagah nitish kumaar khud lenge yaa ek or mahadalit udai narayan choudhary ko bithaayenge
 Nitish Kumar cannot afford to offend Mahadalits
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki 16 janvari tak maanjhi ko hataa diya jayega
 Manjhi has angered not only Nitish Kumar but also other party leaders with his statements and decisions
 satta ke galiyaaron main ab unki vidaai ke charche hai
 But he has made it clear that the next CM of Bihar should be Mahadalit like him
 agar unhen hataakar nitish kumaar khud mukhyamantri ban jate hai to mahadalit naaraaz ho jaaenge or unke bina chunaav jeetna asambhav hoga
 Actually, Nitish Kumar wanted to retain the power of the state by making Mahadalit the chief minister, but Manjhi's independent nature and personal views have made Nitish difficult
 kai muddon par donon main matbhed rahe
 Manjhi has strengthened himself among the Mahadalits
 unhone iske liye kai baar party line tak chhod di
 Now the party is unable to tolerate them
 lekin unhen hataane main ghabara bhi rahi he
 After the merger of the two parties it will be easy to remove them
 lekin isse jediu main asantosh ho saktaa he
 Nitish Kumar is unable to forget the massive defeat at the hands of Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha elections and wants to improve his position in some way
 iske liye ve lalu prasad se bhi madad maangane se nahin chuke

 Some are journalists and they only intend to reveal the truth
 dharm or uske thekedaaron kaa pardaafash karne kii baat he, bilkul jis tarah se pichley dinonasaramya or kai baabaaon ke karname saamne aae the
 Often such occasions are less when the drama inside the newsroom can come out and find out how a story is prepared and how to make it accessible to the readers by going through the facts
 'spotlite' aisi hi film he jisamen roman catholic padariyon ke haathon boston main huabacchon ke yon shoshanmaamalon kii padtaal kii gai he
 The film featured a 2001 story when new Boston editor Marty Baron is cast in The Boston Globe
 yahaan uski mulaakaat investegative reporting karne vaali team 'spotlite' se hoti he
 The 'spotlight' team then investigates these cases
 jaise-jaise paraten khulti jaati hanchaunkaane vaale tathyasamne aane lagate hai
 As a result, 80 clergy who sexually abuse children in Boston are exposed, and this team wrote 600 articles
 iske baad puri duniya bhar main is tarah ke maamle saamne aae
 It was because of his excellent work that The Boston Globe was awarded the 2003 Public Service for the Pulitzer Prize

 The video of the lion hunt that went viral on Twitter, is the life of the buffalo that survived in the wilderness of the wilderness of Africa, the lion, the king of the video-forest, once the victim falls behind, then understand that his disaster will come
 lekin kabhi aisa suna yaa dekha he ki sher kaa puraa parivaar kisi jaanavar kaa shikaar kar rahaa ho or wo bich main se uthakar bhaag jaae
 As if no one could eat the food kept in the plate
 soshal media par in dinon ek aisa hi video dhooma machaa rahaa he, jahaan sher ke parivaar ne ek bhens kaa shikaar to kiya lekin bhens bich main se hi uthakar chali gai
 These # lionshave a lesson to teach
 They were having their meal but decided to fight with each other
 And food walked away

 yahaan ek sher apane parivaar ke saath bhens kaa shikaar karne kii koshish kar rahaa hai, lekin itane main hota kya he ki sher ke bachche aapas main khilne lagate hai
 Then the lion and the lioness become so busy with their children that they forget to take care of the prey
 mauka dekhte hi bhens bhi chaalaaki dikhaati he or vahaan se turant nau do gyaarah ho jaati he
 That lioness was from other pride

 This video is getting frequent retweet and likes on social media
 ab soshal media par is video ne ek dhamal to machaaya hi he, ek nai bahes or ched di he
 Actually, this debate is also interesting because some people are believing that this is the kind face of a lion's family, while some people are enjoying the ignominy of small lions

 England's batting will be around Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott, Ravi Bopara and all-rounder Samit Patel, while Stiven Finn, Tim Bresnan and Jade Dernbach will handle the pace attack

 jsp sibiai durupyog ke naam par kolkata main mamata didi kii dharnagiri jari he
 At the center of this quarrel with the Modi government is the biggest economic scam in West Bengal, the Saradha chit fund scam
 is ghotaale main sattadhari trinmul congress ke kai bade netaaon ke naam hai
 Now, there is complete opposition in front of the Center, including Mamata Banerjee, as a threat to the Constitution and democracy
 lekin is ladaai kii asal vajah sirf raajnneetik laabh ke liye sibiai kaa upyog nahin he, balki kai or bhi kaaran hai, jiske chalate mukhyamantri mamata banerjee sadak se satta chalaane par utar ai hai
 The politics of the country has changed into the Bengal war at this time
 sharada chitfund ghotaale main kolkata ke police kamishnar rajeev kumaar par haath daalane kii sibiai kii koshish par sabase badi siyasat jari he
 If Mamata Banerjee has sat on a dharna, the BJP reached the Election Commission
 aaj supreme court main is masale par phir sunwaayee he, lekin is puure khel main agar koi ek nishaanaa he to wo hai bengal kii 42 siten
 Of these, 34 TMC, 4 Congress, 3 CPM and 2 BJP currently hold
 ab bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kah rahe hai ki wo bijepi ke do ko 42 main badal denge or mamata banerjee ko shunya par samet denge
 Recently, on his Bengal tour, he had said that we would win all the seats in West Bengal and clear Mamata Banerjee's sop
 jabaki mamata banerjee hunkaar bhar rahi hai ki pichhali baar to do seat mil gai thim, is baar ek bhi nahin milane duungi
 Mamta and BJP have such a focus in Bengal because the equation of politics of the country and especially UP has changed at the moment
 bengal main ladaai ke peeche ye paanch badi ghatnaayen1
 mayawati-akhilesh's alliance in UP 2
 priyanka gandhi kaa raajnneeti main utarana3
 bjp's defeat in three states 4
 endie ke saajheedaaron main machi bhagdad5
 The front formed against the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP got the maximum 71 seats from UP, which gave Narendra Modi the chance to run a strong government as the Prime Minister
 ab upi kii do bade majboot dalon yani samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party kaa vilay ho gaya he
 However, both these parties had got 5 seats in the last election in total and BSP had zero in that too, but the total of both parties was 42
 1 pratishat vot share rahaa tha
 While 42 to the ruling BJP
 6 pratishat vot mili the
 Now, with the SP-BSP alliance, especially dalit-yadav and Muslim votes, the SP-BSP is making claims of a clean sweep in UP hoping to come on one platform
 yah bijepi ke liye ek badi chintaa bhi he
 The Congress has brought Priyanka Gandhi Vadra into politics, which is being considered a big bet
 unhen vishesh taur par purvi upi kaa prabhaar diya gaya he, jahaan congress ateet main acha pradarshan karti rahi he
 In such a situation, it is also being said that with the arrival of Priyanka, the BJP may face a big challenge in Purvanchal, which can change the equation on around 40 seats here
 haal hi main rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main bhartiya janata party kii haar se congress loksabhaa chunaav se pehle badi takat mili he
 As per the election promise of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, in these three states, the Congress has also decided to waive off the loans of farmers as soon as they take power
 ab rahul puure desh main is formule ko aajamaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Against the Modi government, where big regional parties are coming on one platform and together, they are making claims to oust the BJP
 vahiin, modi sarkaar main sahyogi rahe dal hi unki taraf aankh tarer rahe hai
 In UP, Rajbhar and Apna Dal are constantly showing rebellious style
 maharashtra main shivasena bhi apni sharton par saath rahane kaa dambh bhar rahi he
 On the other hand, anti-bjp parties are preparing the roadmap to contest elections according to their respective states
 upi or bihar main yah formula tay ho chukaa he
 The assembly election results in Karnataka have disappointed the BJP
 saath hi dakshin kii raajnneeti main bhi bijepi ko majboot sahyogi nahin milen hai
 In such a situation, the BJP has a keen eye on Bengal and Odisha to fulfill the changing political situation of the country and the impact of the Grand Alliance in North India

 The important thing is that ever since RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das took over, the central bank has kept the inflation rate at 0
 50 fisadi kii katautee kii he
 Let us know that Shaktikanta Das took over as RBI Governor after Urjit Patel's resignation in the month of December

 Overall, RBI can cut repo rate by 75-100 basis points for the entire financial year
 arthshaastri sunil kumaar sinha ke mutabik vikaas dar main susti or kam mudrasphiti se arabiai ko repo dar main katautee kaa mauka mila he
 He said, "we expect the repo rate to be cut by 25 basis points, but the top bank may cut it further
" haalanki rate main katautee par monsoon kii pragati or kachche tel kii vaishvik keemat kaa bhi prabhaav padegaa
 "in addition, Madhvi Arora, chief economist at Edelweiss Securities, said," We expect a 25 basis point reduction in the June policy review, followed by a 25 basis point cut again in the next meeting
 " bataa den ki vartmaan main repo rate 6 fisadi he
 What will happen to you, you will get the benefit of rbi's repo rate reduction
 darasal, arabiai ke is faisle ke baad bainkon par byaaj dar kam karne kaa dabaav banegaa
 In the event of low interest rate, those people whose home or auto loan EMI is running will benefit

 Let me tell you that in the film Dabangg 3, Salman Khan with Sai Manjrekar, Sonakshi Sinha and Arbaaz Khan
 is film ko diarector prabhu deva bana rahe hai
 It will be released on 20 December
 kitaab:chuudi bazaar main ladkilekhak:krishna kumarprakashak:raajakmal prakashankimat:300 rupee (hardbound)stri ko lekar prachlit manyataon kaa gheraa 18 varsh kii aayu kii ladki ko jis purnataa se kasata he, vah kisi anya aayu par lagu nahin hota
 In this age, family, society, religion, morality, everything starts to dominate together
 aisa lagane lagata he jaise vah ladki 18 kii hokar gunaah kar baithi
 Living with a different kind of fear becomes one of his habit
 use tamaam hidaayaten di jane lagati hai
 
 
 Don't walk like this, don't stop like this, don't speak like this, don't look like this
 
 
 or phir vah ek bhay ke saath jeene lagati he
 To be honest, that fear is not terror
 bhay to use kehete hai jo kabhi-kabhaar lage, jaise andhere se lage to ujaale main aakar dur ho jaae, pita se lage to uske offis jane par hat jaae
 Fear of family, society, religion, morality gets entrenched in the whole consciousness, girls learn to live with her and thus living becomes the definition of their being a girl
 bharat ke sandarbh main dekhen to nari ek jatil saamaajik rachana he
 She is born as a human being, but with birth, her undertaking of restructuring starts with the hard tools of culture
 samskruti ke isi kathor aujaaron par jab ek sadhe hue shikshavid kii nazar padati he to uske liye samaaj ke is saanskrithik chehre kii krurta ko dekhnaa kaaphi kshtdaai ho jaataa he
 He gets restless and then starts his own journey
 use yaad aa rahi hoti he bachapan kii vah ghatana jahaan wo ladakiyon ko apni maa evam anya auraton ke saath chuudi kii dukaan main jate dekha karata tha
 Where a girl would raise her hand in front of the shopkeeper to wear the bangle
 ab use vah ek mahatvapurn saanskrithik ghatana jaan padati he
 She now understands that the birth of the desire to wear a bangle and the sense of accepting the bangle as a means of beauty are the natural stages of converting a little girl into a male-dominated civilization
 'chuudi bazaar main ladki' paanch adhyay main simati bhartiya stri kii saamaajik, saanskrithik or naitik vyavastha par gahan padtaal karti ek clasik kriti he
 In this book, a fairly nuanced analysis of the behavior of girls at home and in the family and what changes in their lives is made
 tamaam tarah ke saahitiyik or saanskrithik mithkon par gahan chintan ke saath hi ek bacchee ke bachapan se lekar javaani or phir uske kai roopon main sthapit hone tak arthath bacchee se yuvati or phir aurat banane kii puri prakiya kaise purushavaadi soch ke ird-gird saamaajik or saanskrithik kriya-kalapon dwaara sanchalit ho rahi he, lekhak krishna kumaar ne iskaa vishlelshan is pustak main kaaphi gaharaai se kiya he
 Seeing a successful woman being confused by a man reflects the social and cultural crisis of that man
 pehle meri samaj kuch aisi hi thi lekin is pustak kaa adhyayan karne ke baad yah samaj bani ki vah purush hi nahin samaaj main prachlit manyataon, saanskrithik mithkon or naitikta ke naam par ek ghere main mahilaon ko baandhne kaa chalan ek prakriya he jiskaa sanchaalan bade suniyojit dhang se parivaar, samaaj, shiksha or dharmik-saanskrithik aayojanon ke jariye kiya ja rahaa he
 That man is just a part of it
 jarurat he jahaan bhi or jis swaroop main aise myth saamne aaen us par khulkar charchaa ho
 Discussion in front of boys and girls
 is pustak ke madhyam se shikshavid krishna kumaar ne ek bacchee se aurat banane kii un sari saamaajik or saanskrithik prakriyaaon ko kaaphi samvedansheeltaa ke saath bayaan kiya he
 And one thing is that the importance of myth is eternal, but its role in personal and social life should be changed on the scale of history
 bharat kii striyon ke jivan main aisa kyon nahin hua, yah ek bada prashn he jiske uttar kii toh main jane par hamen pitrusatta, samskruti or rajya (shiksha ko lekar) ke bich gathbandhan kaa majboot dhaancha nazar aayega
 In the modern era, when the democratic state has given legal protection to the dignity of the person and equality between individuals, the life of the Indian woman should remove the shadow of the myths that convey her helplessness to the woman
 ye myth kabhi dharm kii aad main to kabhi parampara or prachlan kii aad main ladakiyon ke dimag par apni pakad banaate hai or shiksha is pakad ko dhilaa nahin kar paati
 Girls of today must read this book so that they can be able to understand the situations which are unnecessarily hindering their progress

 Bhajji, Ashwin, Bhuvi do good batting Kohli said before leaving for the three-test series against Sri Lanka, 'ashwin, Bhuvi and Bhajji all bat well
 aswin kaa test ausat 40 he or mujhe aisa koi kaaran najar nahin aata jisase yah kaha ja sake ki vah hamaare liye olerounder nahin ban saktaa
 The challenge is to give people a target and ask them to improve on specific aspects according to the need of the team

 He said, 'you have to play with a strong bowling attack to win a Test match and it is more attractive and satisfying
 haa isaki (teen spinneron ke saath khelnaa) sambhaavna he
 Our goal is to get 20 wickets
 meraa maananaa he ki yadi aapako iske liye team ko mauka dena he to apane sarvshereshth gendbaajon ke saath khelnaa hoga
 Playing with five bowlers means six top-order batsmen will have to bear more responsibility
 'khaas ranneetiyaan aajamaane kaa mauka milegakohli ne iske saath yah bhi kaha ki srilanka siries se unhen apni kuch khaas ranneetiyon ko aajamaane kaa sahi mauka bhi milegaa

 asal main in teen test maichon ke aadhaar par khud kaa aankalan karnaa or yah pataa karnaa ki vastav main hamane kitni baar vaisaa kiya jaisaa ham chaahate the
 i think you don't get this chance in the only Test match
 aapako ek saptaah yaa das din taiyaari kerani hoti or yah match paanch din chalata he
 You have to improve immediately and get to the next match

 He has improved his game a lot in the last year and a half
 vah hamen thos shuruuaat detaa he
 There are minor light injuries in cricket
 meraa maananaa he ki khiladiyon ko in choti choton se ubarne ke liye vishram kaa samay bhi milanaa chahie
 As far as Vijay is concerned, he is almost fit
 mujhe vishwaas he ki vah match feet hoga
 The Indian captain is happy that there is competition due to the presence of KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan in the top order
 unhone kaha, 'jahaan tak opening ko lekar compatishan kii baat he to yah kaaphi kadi he
 Rahul is batting very well while Shikhar continues to perform well
 'rohit ko or maukey milane chahiekohli ne rohit sharma ke test maichon main lagaataar lachar pradarshan kaa bhi bachaav kiya

 He comes in at number six in Test matches
 meraa maananaa he ki yadi vah chalane laga to ek satr main virdohi team ke haath match chin legaa
 He did well when he played at number three in Australia
 mujhe lagata he ki use adhik avasar dene kii jarurat he
 When he is well set in his batting order, he will be told that we need a batsman in the middle order who maintains the run rate

 pakistan taharik-e-insaaf party pakistan neshnal essembly main sabase badi party banakar ubhar rahi he or kayaas lag rahaa he ki pakistan kii nai sarkaar imran khan ke netritv main banane ja rahi he
 If this happens, the power of Pakistan is going to prove to be a thorny crown for Imran Khan
 kam se kam pakistan kii maujuuda aarthik sthiti ko dekhte hue aisa kaha ja saktaa he
 Pakistan faces innumerable economic challenges, but the former PML-N government has failed to accelerate economic activity in the country during its tenure
 yah vifaltaa pakistan kii aarthik chunautiyon ko adhik vikat kar detii hai
 Because during the tenure of the former government, the prices of crude oil in the global market remained at their lowest level

 At the same time, till July 13, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves reached a four-year low and recorded at 9 thousand million
 is dauraan aayaat 15 fisadi badhate hue lagbhag 60 billian dollar ke record str par ja pahunchaa
 This led to Pakistan's trade deficit of $ 37 billion during FY 2018

 If the NDA government led by BJP is formed at the Center, then Narendra Modi could be the next Prime Minister
 aise main yah sawaal uthta he ki agar modi piem banate hai to duniya ke saath bharat ke rishte kaise honge
 The United States is beginning to express its eagerness to work with the new government of India even before the final results of the general election
 haalanki, modi ko vija diya jaae yaa nahin, is par koi baat nahin ho rahi he
 There are speculations among Washington-based policymakers that if Modi becomes the next Prime Minister of India, how will it be with Pakistan and China and with the US
 gauratlab he ki america videsh mantralay ne 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad kathith maanavadhikaron ke ulanghan ke aadhaar par 2005 main modi kaa america daure ke liye diya gaya vija aavedan radd kar diya tha
 However, America must have got some relief from those statements of Modi in the past
 apane intervyuu ke dauraan modi ne is baat par jor diya ki vija masale kaa america ke prati bharat kii niti ko lekar unke faisle par koi asar nahin hoga
 In an interview last week, Modi said, 'it was Vajpayee ji who started a new era of partnership with America
 ham ise or majboot karenge or aage le jaaenge
 'we will not forget the incident of Visa Modiimodi's personality is seen, it is clear that it does not matter what Modi is, he cannot forget the incident of the US refusing to grant visas
 aise main sambhaavna he ki bharat or america ke rishte ek baar phir usee str tak pahunch jaaenge, jaisaa donon deshon ke bich parmaanu samjhaute ke vakt hua tha
 Also, a lot of work needs to be done between Washington and New Delhi to end the bitterness that has arisen in the relations between India and America over the years
 modi ko vija nahin die jane ke liye mukhya taur par jimmedaar logon kii chintaa is baat ko lekar he ki agar modi piem banate hai to desh main dharmik aazaadee par nakaaratmak asar padegaa
 Apart from these, there are some people who feel that India's relations with Pakistan and Afghanistan will be spoiled by the formation of Modi's government
 bharat ke kareeb honge china-japalmerica main is baat ko lekar kaaphi dilchaspee he ki modi piem banate hai to china ke saath bharat ke rishte kaise honge
 Modi has visited China and Japan while being the CM of Gujarat
 aise main adhiktar americanyon kaa maananaa he ki aane vaale dinon bharat kaa in donon deshon ke prati jhukaav bad saktaa he
 New relationship with America Last week, an article was published in China's official newspaper 'global Times'
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki agar modi piem banate hai to pashchimi deshon main khalabali much jaaegi jabaki bharat or china ek duusare ke najadik aaenge
 Although the article does not talk much about human rights and religious freedom, it is hoped that Modi can formulate a definition of relationship with the West of India if he becomes PM
