 In order to win the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, Congress General Secretary and in-charge of Eastern UP, Priyanka Gandhi is engaged in correcting the political equation
 congress vahi tareeke apana rahi he jise bhaajapa 2014 main aajamaa chuki he
 After being sidelined with the SP-BSP alliance, the Congress is strengthening its traditional vote bank as well as forging alliances with smaller parties in the state
 congress ne uttar pradesh main abhi tak 3 dalon ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 The Congress first joined hands with the great party
 iske baad krishna patel kii apana dal or babu singh kushvaha kii rashtriya jan adhikaar party (RJAP) se samjhauta kiya
 The Congress has given 2 seats to Apna Dal and 7 seats to RJAP
 haalanki 5 siten sidhe taur par di gai hai or 2 siton par uske ummidavaar congress ke simbel par chunaav ladenge
 The BJP won the election in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 Assembly elections in alliance with similar small parties in Uttar Pradesh
 loksabhaa main apana dal ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha to vidhansabha main om prakaash rajbhar kii suheldev bhartiya samaaj party ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha
 Under this formula, Congress has joined hands with these three parties
 iske jariye congress ne gaiyr yadav obisi maton ko saadhane kii ranneeti banaai he
 Apna Dal base where Kurmi voters are
 vahiin, mahandal or rashtriya jan adhikaar party kaa aadhaar maury, shakya, saini or kushvaha matadaata hai
 The vote of these two communities is around 12 percent
 maujuuda samay main is votbank par philhal bijepi kaa kabja he
 In such a situation, the Congress has made a strategy to defeat the BJP by casting these votes
 bijepi ne satta kaa vanvaas khatm karne ke liye 2014 main chote dalon ke saath gathbandhan karne ke saath-saath duusare dalon ke baagi netaaon ko party main shaamil karaayaa tha
 They were given tickets and put them in the election fray
 bijepi ne basapa, sapa or congress se aae baagiyon kaa bijepi bada thikaana bani thi
 BJP also got its benefit
 isi tarj par congress bhi 2019 ke chunaav main baagiyon kaa thikaana ban rahi he
 After Priyanka Gandhi becomes active, rebel leaders of opposition parties continue to join Congress
 sapa-basapa-bijepi se aae in netaaon ko party kii sadsyta hi nahin di ja rahi he balki unhen tikat bhi diya ja rahaa he
 So far, in the list of Congress released in the state, the party has made about a dozen rebels from other parties as its candidates
 itnaa hi nahin congress mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ganga ke jariye prayagraj se kaashi kii yatra kar rahi hai
 It is being seen as an exercise in social equations along with giving a big political signal
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah soobe ke mallaah voton ko paale main laane kii ranneeti he
 The community has about 5 percent of the vote in the state
 mallaah samudaay soobe main nishad, bind, kevat, kashyap, dhuria, rajowar, dhimaar, maanjhi or botham naam se jaani jaataa he
 They have direct influence on Lok Sabha seats in Firozabad, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Kairana, Machilishahar, Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Phulpur, Gorakhpur, Sitapur, Balia, Deoria, Unnao, Fatehpur and Jalaun
 congress baagiyon or chote dalon ke sahare bijepi ko gherne main juty he
 It remains to be seen whether the Congress can defeat the BJP with this social engineering strategy

 Hanuman Beniwal demands that Banjara Basti be rehabilitated from where he has been removed in the name of encroachment, but no government representative has reached for talks with Beniwal
 beniwal ne kaha he ki vaarta karne vaale adhikariyon or sarkaar ke pratinidhi se ve thos baatcheet karke hi uthenge, kyonki mahapadav se pehle kaha gaya tha ki atikaraman hataane vaale esadm ko hataaya jayega or mukadmaa darj kiya jayega lekin baad main espi ne inkaar kar diya he
 Meanwhile, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has already announced ahead of Beniwal's rampage that the government will rehabilitate Banjara people who have been removed from encroachment on the orders of the High Court

 Also, there was a post on social media by former Nagaur MP Jyoti Mirdha in which he called Hanuman Beniwal allegedly a nuisance and accused him of spreading a frenzy by calling his mlas obstructive in the work of the government
 jis par beniwal ne manch se kaha ki jyoti mirdha keval asi ke kamare main baithkar soshal media par likhnaa jaanati hai, jameen par utarkar logon ke dukh dard ko samajhnaa unke bas kii baat nahin he, agar unamem dam he to ve phir se maidan main aaen or aagaamee dinon main hone vaale khinvsar vidhansabha ke upachunaav main chunaav ladakar dikhaaen

 The administration in Nagaur, Rajasthan, made the Banjara Basti encroachment free in compliance with the High Court's order and after seeing the ruckus it seems that the administration has put a hand in the bee hive

 di news daily ne sutron ke hawaale se kaha ki raashtrapati kii haalat sthir he or vah khatre se baahar hai kyonki unhen hua mastishkaghat or raktasrav unki ‘jaan ke liye jokhim ’ nahin bana
 Zardari is considered to be a strong critic of the newspaper, according to which Zardari needs some treatment which includes 'speech therapy'
 akhbaar ne sutron ke hawaale se kaha ki jaradaari ko aage ke ilaaj ke liye vimaan se landan le jaaya ja saktaa he 
 Following authorities' denial that Zardari had not suffered a heart attack, sources claimed that Zardari 'collapsed at Rashtrapati Bhavan' on Tuesday due to a brain stroke
 raashtrapati ke pravaktaa ne kaha tha ki jaradaari kii haalat sthir he tathaa dubai main unke or chikitsa pareekshan honge
 The spokesman said that the president has been shifted from the ICU to a general room of the hospital
 jaradaari mangalvaar ko chikitsa jaanch ke liye achaanak dubai chale gaye the jiske bare main adhikariyon ne kaha tha ki unki hriday sambandhi samasya ke bare main pehle se hi pataa tha
 Zardari's sudden visit to Dubai had led to speculation that he might resign on the basis of 'poor health' amidst the increasing pressure on him due to the 'memogate' scandal

 On the choice of remixes of today's generation, he said that the romantic song is an expression of love
 50-60 pehle jo culture tha, us hisaab se gane banate the
 Today love is the same, but the way of expressing it has changed
 aaj ke yuva bahut travel karte hai

 Due to the dhak-dhak song Madhuri, popular Anuradha sang the song 'dhak-dhak Kare Laga' from the Anil kapoor-madhuri Dixit starrer film 'beta'

 About this, he said that that song was famous because of Madhuri ji, not mine
 wo bahut acchhee artist hai
 i saw the film when this song became popular

 To give way to ambulances on the road, NDTV India has launched a campaign called right-lane, life-lane, through which we are constantly passing the picture of the reality of the roads and the traffic-ridden ambulance to the common people
 is muhim kaa makasad kisi bhi karaan jam main fansi ambulance or usamen jivan or maut se ladati jindagi ko aap rasta dene main deree naa karen
 Because each moment of time is valuable for the patient and if such treatment is not available in such a situation, then it can become life-threatening
 ye baat sirf dilli kii trephic vyavastha kii nahin he balki puure desh kaa haal kuch aisa hi he jisaki tasdik aankade bhi karte hai
 It is up to the people to take this campaign to the end
 hamaari koshish bas unhen jaagruk karne kii he
 Recall that during the Commonwealth Games, the blue lane used only for players and sports officials, but it is better to always leave one lane empty during normal working days in emergency situations
 dilli police ke joint seepi, trephic anil shukla ke anusaar niyam se juyada zaruri he ki log samajhadaar or jimmedaar bane
 In this context, from time to time, the traffic police also conduct a campaign
 iske alaava dilli police ne immergency ambulance kii raah main roda banane vaali gadiyon ko lekar 2000 rupee kaa chaalaan kaatane kaa bhi niyam banaaya he
 The problem is also one of thinking, if the patient can get treatment a few minutes before giving way to an ambulance and these moments can be priceless for him, then why should we be responsible for delay by making ourselves a roadblock

 laabh ke pad ke maamle main somvaar ko aap vidhayakon ke vakil kevi vishvanathan ne hoicourt main kaha ki chunaav ayog ki sifarish gaiyrkanoonee he
 During the debate, the AAP mlas argued that the Election Commission had assured their client on June 23, 2017 that the final debate in the case would begin and the date would be given to them, but they were neither called nor adjudicated thereafter
 20 mlas were disqualified

 What the Election Commission has done is a direct violation of the natural principles of justice

 Mulayam Singh Yadav's relationship with Akhilesh Yadav is sour and sweet
 apeksha or us par khare utarane kaa maamla he
 You can say that it is a matter of home
 lekin mulaayam nitish se kyon naaraaz hai
 Mulayam Singh Yadav played the most effective role in pressing Nitish Kumar to replace Jitan Ram Manjhi and become Chief Minister, who had a consensus in a few hours before making Nitish Kumar a Chief Ministerial candidate in Bihar in a few hours to hold a joint press conference
 Why are Mulayam angry with the same Nitish nowadays? ab tak mulaayam singh yadav ne apane samarthakon or lalu yadav, sharad yadav ke saath mulaakaat main jo man kii baat kii hai usamen unhone siton ke talmail main nazarandaaj kiye jane ke alaava, congress se badhati najdiki ko mukhya kaaran bataaya he

 usase bhi zyada congress party ko bihar main 40 siten dene or swabhimaan raily main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bulaane par bhi mulaayam ne naaraazgi jataai

 The leaders of Samajwadi Party's Bihar unit also believe that even though some candidates were likely to become mlas in fighting the Grand Alliance, there is hardly any guarantee in fighting all the seats now

 The key to the party will be of Votkatwa, and this time in the electoral atmosphere in Bihar, hardly anyone can vote for Votkatwa
 tippaniyan The real question is why did Mulayam leave Bihar's Grand Alliance in the limelight and why are his views so hot? If the Rashtriya Janata Dal's leaders are to be believed, then the BJP is blackmailing some big leaders of the Samajwadi Party on the basis of evidence in some old and new cases

 The AAP spokespersons allege that despite writing several letters to the Election Commission, the mlas were not called for hearing
 'aap' pravaktaa raghav chaddha kaa kahana he ki sansadeey sachiv maamle main20 vidhayakone aktubar 2017 or navambar 2017 main ayog ko baqayada likhit chitthee dekar sunwaayee main shaamil hokar apana paksh rakhane kii apil kii thi
 But the mlas were not called
 23 june ke apane order main chunaav ayog ne yah kaha tha ki vidhayakon ko sunwaayee ke liye suchit kiya jayega, lekin uske baad kabhi vidhayakon ko bulaayaa hi nahin gaya
 Raghav Chadha has questioned the newly appointed Election Commissioner OP Rawat, making serious allegations
 raghav kaa aarope he ki jin o pi ravat ne apni bijepi se nazdikiyon ke chalate aam aadmi party ke vidhayakon ke is maamle se apane aap ko dur kar liya tha, wo aakhri chah maheene main phir se is maamle main shaamil hue or ayog kii report main unhone bhi hastakshar kar die
 Why did this happen? The reason for this is beyond comprehension
 aam aadmi party ke mutabik 'aap' vidhayakon ko ayogy tehraane vaali report main naseem jaidi ke baad mukhya chunaav ayukta bane sunil aroda ke hastakshar bhi maujuud hai, jinhone vidhayakon kii is file ko kabhi dekha bhi nahin or wo is maamle se puri tarah se anbhigya rahe
 How did it happen that Sunil Arora also signed the report? a Rajya Sabha MP from Aam Aadmi Party, Sanjay Singh, waving a letter to the Election Commission, claiming that "the Chief Election Commissioner gave 20 mlas a chance to speak up and present their case" Did not even give it and Tughlaqi decreed
 chunaav ayog ne 23 june 2017 ko likhit main kaha tha ki voam aadmi party ke vidhayakonko sunwaayee ke liye bulaayenge, lekin ayog ne aisa nahin kiya or apana ek tarafa faisla suna diya
 "ever since the cancellation of membership to 20 mlas, the Aam Aadmi Party has been alleging that AK Joti, who gave the decision as the Chief Election Commissioner in the Parliamentary Secretary case, forced 20 mlas under pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 Disqualified, which is an action taken directly under the political conspiracy

 In this government, the BJP will be the Chief Minister and the JJP quota will be the Deputy Chief Minister
 aapako bataa den ki, jananaayak janata party netaa dushyant chautaala ke tihaad jail main band pita ajay chautaala ko furlo mil gai he

 BJP leader and Union Minister Dr
, who won the last election by more than two and a half lakh votes
 mahesh sharma (dr Mahesh Sharma) ke liye is baar raah aasaan nahin najar aa rahi he
 Especially, after the SP-BSP alliance the picture has changed
 gathbandhan ke tahatyah seat basapa ke khate main gai he or party neyaha se satbir nagar (satbeer Nagar) ko pratyaashee banaaya he

 The biggest threat to Mahesh Sharma this time is BSP candidate Satbir Nagar
 kyonkispa-basapa or rashtriya lokdal ke sanyukt ummidavaar to hai hi
 He also has the support of the Aam Aadmi Party
 haalanki duusari taraf,congress ke arvind singh (arvind Kumar Singh) mukaable main to hai lekin un par bahari hone kaa thappa laga he

 Mahesh Sharma was joined by almost all classes, but this time the political situation has changed

 com / ci35lhueiv Leading the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj targeted NDTV on NDTV, citing an interview of wikileaks owner Julian Assange on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the wikileaks revelations on the cash-for-vote scam
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki ghotaalon main dusron ke naam ginaakar pradhanmantri apni zimmedaari se batch nahin sakate
 He said that instead of talking here and there, he should give direct answer and if he does not know anything, then what is the compulsion to remain Prime Minister? Taking part in the discussion on the statement made by the Prime Minister on 18 March 2011 regarding the newspaper report about the payment of cash in lieu of votes under Rule 193 in the Lok Sabha, Sushma said this through a famous lion
 unhone sadan main maujuud pradhanmantri se mukhaatib hote hue kaha, tu idhar-udhar kii na baat kar, ye bataa ke kaaravaan kyon lutaa, ye rehguzar kii baat nahin, teri rahabari (netritv) kaa sawaal he
 Sushma said that as the head of the government, during the trust vote in 2008, the Prime Minister can not turn away from his responsibilities by making others a scapegoat on the note-for-vote issue, because the votes of mps bought after spending crores of rupees benefit the most
 He got only because his government survived
 vipaksh kii netaa ne pradhanmantri par hamale kii kaman sambhalate hue tabadatod sawaal kiye, pradhanmantri kii aadat he
 He says on everything, i do not know anything, my party did nothing
 
 
 meri sarkaar ne kuch nahin kiya 
 
 unhen nahin pataa to kise pataa tha? puure cond kaa labhaarthi koun hone vaala tha? pradhanmantri pad par koun bane rahane vaala tha? agar aapako nahin pataa tha to bhi aap baraabar ke jimmedaar hai

 Some lucky personalities from big names from the entertainment world get this opportunity and in 2016, this opportunity was felt by Priyanka Chopra and it is obvious that everyone will keep an eye on what the desi girl will wear
 Will Indian clothing be Priyanka's choice or foreign dress? priyanka par abhi se pressure he ki auskar jaise kaarykram main pehali baar ek bhartiya ko yah mauka mila he isliye priyanka ko desi dress pahanani chahie
 At the same time, Priyanka says that she is Indian and loves India very much, but she does not have to prove herself by wearing a dress and a veneer to seal it
 'main bhartiya hum
 
 
 India is in my blood
 
 
 lekin ek dress pahan ke yaa na pahan ke mere deshprem ko nahin aankaa janaa chahie
 
 auskar kaa yah mauka mere aaj tak ke kaam kaa nichod he or us kaam main bhartiyata jhalkati he

 In Maharashtra, the 40 per cent voter OBC community in Maharashtra, the three OBC faces of the bjp's OBC face Nadarmadharam, in the seventies, the socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia once gave the slogan 'the Samajwadi Socialist Party tied the knot backward to sixty in the hundredth
 ' lohia ne ye naaraa bihar or uttar pradesh main satta par brahman or savarna varchasv ko todane ke liye diya tha
 During the 2014 and then 2019 Lok Sabha elections, PM Modi also played a political battle by playing the card of being from the backward class himself
 ab maharashtra kii siyaasi jameen par ek baar phir bijepi ne camel khilaane ke liye obisi daanv chalaa he
 BJP President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah has commanded the obcs and said on Tuesday in Beed, Maharashtra, "the previous governments could not do anything for the other backward classes during the last 70 years
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne hi sanvaidhanik dhaanche ke madhyam se pichde varg ke logon kii samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye obisi ayog kaa gathan kiya
 Outside the OBC trinity scene, three prominent OBC leaders of BJP in Maharashtra, Gopinath Munde, Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde, were believed to have come to the party with the OBC vote
 ye teenon obisi netaa alag-alag kaarnon se is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main seen se baahar hai
 This is the reason why Amit Shah himself has started the exercise of keeping the obcs tight
 maharashtra main obisi netaa nitin choudhary ne kaha ki obisi varg ke vibhinn samudaayon main ek shashakt network ke nahin hone ke chalate ve sab ek manch par nahin hai, zyaadaatar netaaon kaa aadhaar mahaj apni jatiyon main he
 But even though the OBC may not have a face in the BJP in the changed political environment, the voters and workers are seen standing with the BJP
 maharashtra main obisi siyasatabata den ki maharashtra main obisi kareeb 356 jatiyon main vibhajit hai or inhen 19 fisadi aarakshan miltaa he
 According to the last caste census held in 1931, 52% of the total population of the country was of the Backward Classes
 maharashtra main obisi kii aabaadi kareeb 40 fisadi he, jisamen dhanagar, ghumantu, kunbi, banjaaraa, taili, mali, lohaar or kurmi jaisi jatiyaan shaamil hai
 The politics of OBC class in Maharashtra gained momentum when the government implemented the Mandal Commission recommendations
 isamen bijepi ke gopinath munde, ensipi ke chagan bhujabal, ekanath khadse, naanaa patole jaise chehre ubharkar saamne aae
 Munde was considered to be the OBC of BJP, a major force in the politics of Maharashtra, but due to the politics of Maratha supremacy, he could not get that political milestone
 yahi vajah he ki itani badi aabaadi hone ke baad bhi maharashtra main ek bhi siem obisi samudaay se nahin bana
 Whereas, the OBC community has played an important role in strengthening the political base of Maharashtra BJP, in which Gopinath Munde played an important role
 vah maharashtra main bijepi kaa cheharaa maane jate the, lekin 2014 main car durghatana main unka nidhan ho gaya
 Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde emerged as the biggest OBC face of the BJP in Maharashtra after Eknath Khadse and Vinod Tawde out of the scene
 bijepi ke ye donon netaa kaaphi kaddavar maane jate the, lekin party ne is baar donon netaaon ko chunavi maidan main nahin utaara he
 BJP has given ticket to his daughter in place of Eknath Khadse
 vahiin, vinod taavade ke bare main aisa kaha ja rahaa ki unhen puri tarah se sidline kar diya gaya he
 In this way, there is no big face of OBC from BJP in the election field

 However, it remains to be seen who becomes the first choice of the OBC community in Maharashtra between the efforts of BJP and Shiv Sena

 Let's take a look at those memorable innings of 400 runs made before today: 19 March 2007 The first opportunity for Team India to score 400 runs came against Bermuda in the 2006–07 World Cup

 India won the match by 257 runs
 ‘main of da match’ rahe virendra sahvaag
 The first ODI of the series played against Sri Lanka in Rajkot on 15 December 2009 was very exciting as the match fell to the team India by a margin of only three runs
 team india ke 414 ranon kaa peechha karne utari srilanka ne 411 ran bana daale
 Sehwag was once again in full swing in the match
 unhone 102 ball par 6 chhakkon or 17 chaukon kii madad se 146 ran banaae
 Apart from him, Sachin Tendulkar (69) and Dhoni (72) scored half-centuries
 jabaki srilanka kii ore se dilashaan 160 ran, sangkaar 90 ran or tharana 67 ran banaae

 Significantly, in the 243-member constitution, voting was held in 81 seats in the first two phases
 unhone kaha, ‘pehle do charnon main jin siton par matdaan hua wo aitihaasik taur par kabhi bhi bijepi kaa garh nahin the

 haalanki, paanchaven or antim charan ke liye unhone kuch bhi anumaan lagane se inkaar kar diya
 He said that the equation for the 57 seats to be voted on November 5 is completely different from the first four phases
 yah puche jane par ki kyabihar vidhansabha chunaavkisi bhi tarah se centre kii pradhanmantri narendra modi nit sarkaar par janamat sangrah hoga to unhone isse inkaar kiya
 He said, 'election of the state is not a mandate at the center

 He said that even if BJP wins a clear majority on its own in the state, it will form a government with its allies
 -input IANS After the demonetisation came into force on 8 November, there were long queues outside banks across the country
 aam aadmi apane paas maujuud 1000 or 500 rupee kii puraani karency ko jamaa karaane ke liye bank pahunchaa
 Banks across the country either issued new currency in lieu of old currency, otherwise they deposited the old currency in the account holder account
 puraani karency ko badalane or jamaa karne kii prakriya puure desh main ek se lekar teen maheene tak alag-alag sharton ke saath kii gai
 Now more than 6 months have passed since the demonetization decision, but the Reserve Bank of India, including the central government, does not have the final figures on how old the banks have deposited the total currency so far
 rigerv bank ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik puraani 1000 or 500 rupee kii karency pratibandhit karne ke baad 15
 An exchange of Rs 4 lakh crore has been done
 vahiin notebandi se pehle tak desh main kul 17
 7 lakh crore currency was in communication
 is hafte notebandi par bani sansadeey samiti ke saamne duusari baar pesh hokar rigerv bank governor urjit patel ne bataaya ki puraani karency kii ginati kaa kaam abhi tak chal rahaa he
 Due to this, there is no data on the currency deposited with the Reserve Bank
 vahiin patel ne daawa kiya ki unhen sitambar tak puraani karency ko ginaney kaa kaam puraa kar liya jayega, jiske baad hi uchit aankade jari kiye ja sakenge
 Also read: Is the biggest lie in demonetisation hidden in the old currency count? The Reserve Bank has to close the annual accounts on June 30
 iske baad july ke madhya tak vah apni vaarshik report jari kar salbhar kaa puraa hisaab-kitaab desh ke saamne rakhata he
 But this time after the statement of Urjit Patel before the Parliamentary Committee, it is expected that the Reserve Bank is ready to present its annual report half-incomplete in July
 iske chalate is report main notebandi ke puure aankade maujuud nahin rahenge
 Now the question arises whether the Reserve Bank is talking about not completing the old currency count just to hide the data
 aisa isliye bhi sambhav he kyonki:1
 The Reserve Bank keeps track of the total currency held by banks in the country on the basis of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)
 rigerv bank ke niyam ke mutabik kisi bhi bank main siaraar ke aadhaar par hi cash ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, after demonetisation, the Reserve Bank has not completed the CRR account and has kept the money with the banks on CRR basis? 2
 rigerv bank ke niyam ke mutabik, uski karency chest main rakhi karency se lekar kisi khaaten main karency kaa sanchaar karte vakt pai-pai kaa hisaab-kitaab kiya jaataa he
 In this entire process, a currency note is checked and counted several times and the accounts are recorded in the books of banks along with the accounts of the Reserve Bank
 kya notebandi ke baad rigerv bank ne karency chest se rupaya nikaalane or bank khaaton main rupee jamaa karne ke kaam ko bina ginati or jaanch ke anjaam diya he?ise bhi padhein: GST se hua notebandi kaa ulta, modi ke cashles india kii niklegi hawa?3
 After the announcement of demonetisation, the Reserve Bank had set up several temporary currency chests to run the communication system across the country
 notebandi ke baad desh kii lagbhag 86 fisadi karency ko nai karency se badalane ke kaam main in asthai karency chest kaa ahm yogadan tha
 But now on the issue of counting currency, what the Reserve Bank is saying is that the work of keeping old notes in its temporary currency chest was done without any counting

 The government had not yet recovered from the first revelation of 'the Hindu' on Rafael that a second case came to light
 is baar hindu kii report ke mutabik rafel saude (rafale Deal) main sarkaar ne bhrashtachar par karrwai kaa cloj hataa diya
 After this, Congress (congress) again became the attacker

 According to the report, just a few days before the signing of the deal, the Indian government made a big concession to the French side
 supplai protocol se kai praavdhaan hataa die
 The provisions of anti-corruption penalties were also removed
 anuchit prabhaav, agent yaa agency ke kamishan par penalty kaa praavdhaan hataaya gaya
 Provision of access to companies' accounts was also removed

 In the first deal, there was a charge of parallel negotiations of the PMO and after this an allegation came that CAG Rajiv Maharishi, who was investigating it, was the Finance Secretary at the time of the deal
 yani ye hiton ke takaraav kaa cese he
 Clearly, the Rafale dispute is continuously pursuing the government

 ' film kaa naam : meri nimmonirdeshak : rahul saankalyastar cast : anjali patil, master karan davemarating : 3avadhi: 1 ghanta 30 minatetanu vaids manu main anand el raay ke saath kaam kar chuke rahul saankalya apane nirdesan main ek chote kasbe kii kahani lekar aae hai
 Let us know in the review how the film is made and what is its story
 
 
 kya he film kii kahani?meri nimmo kahani madhya pradesh ke ek chote kasbe kii he
 Where Nimmo means Anjali Patil lives with her family
 nimmo kaa puraa parivaar jisamen unki mausi ek alag ghar main rahati hai
 Aunt's house is near
 nimmo ke ghar main unki do choti bahanen bhi hai
 a son of Nimmo's aunt, who is eight years old
 use nimmo yani apni didi se pyaar ho jaataa he
 But he could not say this
 is bich nimmo kii shaadi tay ho jaati he
 Despite the marriage being fixed, that eight-year-old child in front of Nimmo feels that she loves him
 kahani aage badhati he
 All the rituals of marriage begin
 nimmo bachche kaa khyaal rakhti he, nahalaati-dhulaati he
 The character of the small child is played by Karan Davam
 chote bachche kaa nadaan pyaar kaise dhire-dhire panapata he, kya nimmo kii shaadi ho paati he, nimmo ke gharavaalon kaa kya kahana he, kahani main kya twist terns aate hai or antat: kahani kaa hashr kya hota he ye sab darshane kii koshish film main kii gai he
 Avengers Infinity War Review: Why all the superheroes came together, can see the strong story, as the film's story of Nimmo is the story of a small town
 is vajah se bahut saare log is kahani main khud ko jarur rilate karenge
 Especially in the case of innocent love of childhood when an old boy falls in love with a girl
 unhen lagata he ki bas unke liye hi bane hai or shaadi ho jaani chahie
 In the film, the best effort has been made to show the same Nadani in the shape of the story
 film ke trailor main bhi ye sab baaten dikhaane kii koshish kii gai thi pehle
 The way Rahul Sankalya has directed it is very good
 film kii cinemetography bhi umdaa he or lokation to khayr badhiya he hi
 There is an attempt to show originality in the story
 ek kasbe main kis tarah baaten kii jaati hai
 The fragrance of the soil of a town is seen in this story
 madhya pradesh main ek khaas tarah kaa lahaza hota he
 Rahul has left no stone unturned to show him in his film
 film main jis tarah se kalakaaron ne umdaa abhinay kiya he vah kamaal kaa he
 Especially Anjali Patil's character
 isse pehle unhone newton main bhi apana damdaar abhinay dikhaaya tha
 Karan Dave, Amar Parihar and other artists have also worked well with him
 film ko anand el raay ne produs kiya he
 The music of the film is given by Krishna
 ek kasbe kii kahani ke liye is film ko jarur dekhni chahie
 REVIEW: The story of Beyond the Clouds is breathless, Ishaan's acting is also an average weak link
 There is no spice in this film
 marpet, ection yaa tadak-bhadak nahin he
 Those looking for spicy commercial films will be disappointed
 film main badi star cast bhi nahin he
 If you are accustomed to watching big stars, then this film is not for you

 Before anyone can understand anything, she sits there falling on the stage and falls completely
 ye sabakuch itani jaldi hota he ki aasapaas khadey logon tak ko ahsaas nahin hota ki abhi-abhi kisi ko goli lagi he
 Even a few seconds after the dancer was shot, some people are there
 lekin phir jaise hi logon kii nazar zamin par giri kulwinder par padati he, sabake hosh ud jate hai
 There is silence throughout the marriage hall
 log cheekhte-chillaate bhaagane lagate hai
 Taking advantage of this scandal in the Mahfil, the person who shot, along with the rifle, escapes from the opportunity
 par kehani abhi khatm nahin hoti he
 Goth was yet to be seen
 jis dancer ko goli lagi thi, pataa nahin tab usamen kitni jaan bachi thi
 Whether it was left or not magar use jis tarah se stage se uthaaya jaataa he
 What is dragged up was the least embarrassing picture of humanity
 par shaadi ke jashn main goli kaise chali? marane vaali dancer koun thi? goli chalaane vaala koun tha? usne dancer ko goli kyon maari?kya ye mahaj ek haadasa tha? yaa phir kahani kuch or he? jo dancer ab se chand second pehle stage par thirak rahi thi
 The same dancer had now become a corpse
 uskaa bejaan jism usee stage par padaa tha
 But after this, whatever the people associated with the wedding ceremony did, it was a shame to humanity
 firing ke baad machi afaraatafari kaa phayda uthaa kar qaatil faraar ho chukaa tha
 The death of a dancer by firing above the stage in a stuffy gathering
 upar se maut ke baad logon kaa is dancer yaa yun kahen ki dancer kii laash ke saath ye sitam
 After being shot there, dragging the body of a dancer from the stage and dragging it up, the hearts of these people did not sweat even once
 kuch aayojak goli lagane ke fouran baad haath-pairon se taang kar kulwinder kilashko kuch aise uthaa le jate hai, jaisaa koi jaanavar ke saath bhi nahin karata
 Kulwinder's lifeless body is dragging on the ground due to drag
 sir sidhiyon par takaraa rahaa he
 The edge of the blood coming out of the head is making the land red
 upar se laash uthaa kar le jate log gaaliyaan bhi bak rahe hai
 The murderer has escaped from the murders
 shuchita kii raajnneeti kaa daawa karne vaali bijepi kii rajasthan ikai ne jail se jamaanat par baahar aae vidhayakon ko mantri bana diya he
 The party finally agreed to make tainted mlas ministers after seven days of meditating
 iske baad vasundhara raaje ke mantrimandal main do daagiyon samet 12 vidhayakon ko shaamil kar liya gaya jinamein se 9 ko cabinet mantri banaaya gaya
 But the question is what will happen to these ministers if the bail is canceled
 vahiin daagi mantriyon kii vajah se akasar fansati rahi congress ab bijepi ko aaina dikhaa rahi he
 Rajendra Rathore is the first name among the ministers who became the favorite minister of Vasundhara Rathore
 unka central jail jaipur main kai baar aana-janaa ho chukaa he
 In his charge sheet, the CBI has made him the main conspirator of Daria Singh fake encounter
 lekin ye mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke sabase chahete maane jate hai
 Hence the promise of a clean government was forgotten in the face of 'favoriteism'
 haalanki rajendra rathod khud par lage aaropon ko congress sarkaar kii sajeesh bataa rahe hai
 Kataria, accused in the fake encounter, is also in the cabinet, besides number two in Rajasthan BJP and the face of RSS, Gulabchand Kataria, is also out on anticipatory bail in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case
 unhen sibiai ne pichhali sarkaar main rajasthan ke grahamantri rahete hue soharabuddin farji encounter main sajeesh rachane kaa aaropee mana he
 But Kataria says he will prove himself innocent
 unhone kaha, 'maamle main to kuch he hi nahin
 i have received anticipatory bail and it continues till today
 duusari baat maine dhara 227 lagaai he ki jo chargeshit pesh hui vah galat he
 'from the balance of caste in the cabinet to the history of Babulal Nagar, the Congress is now shrinking its nose and eye after seeing the stains on the Vasundhara government
 party kii pravaktaa archana sharma ne is babat bijepi par hamalaa bolaa
 Apart from this, an attempt has been made to give place to the leaders of most castes in the cabinet to balance the caste equation
 baaki se kaha gaya he ki jo apane loksabhaa chunaav main party ko zyada voton se jitaayega vah agle mantrimandal vistaar main jagah paaegaa
 However, the woman chief minister of the state has not made any woman a minister

 Pankajane said on Wednesday evening that the media saw that i took off the slippers, and someone picked them up
 lekin media ko yah nahin dikhaa ki nange paanv chalane main mujhe kitni takalif hui? phislan bhari sadak dekhakar maine saamaanya rup se apni chappal utaar di or aage bad gayi
 i did not even know that someone had taken my slippers
 is baat kaa mujhe baad main pataa chalaa
 He said, that person is my personal employee
 koi sarkari karmchaaree nahin he
 The real news is the drought and the condition of the farmers
 congress pravaktaa al-naseer jakaaria ne kaha ki is ghatana ne pankaja ke daavon kii dhajjiyaan uda di hai ki unhen garibon ke dukh kaa ehsaas he
 -input language devdas apte ji 24 saal ke rahe honge jab 1963 main nanaaji deshmukh unhen avadh- tirhut mail se guwahati le gaye
 Apte, who reached Guwahati after a 50-hour journey, had no contact in Assam
 jisase bhi mili pehali baar mili or jahaan bhi gaye khud apane prayaas se pehali baar gaye
 On 19 May, while celebrating the historic victory of BJP in Assam, i called Apteji, who was eighty years old
 pehali baar baat karte hue sankoch kar rahaa tha lekin saamaanya parichay ke aadhaar par hi baatcheet hone lagi
 Apte is one of the RSS pracharaks who went to Assam
 bijepi kii jeet kaa jashn unke bhaavon main nahin utraa tha
 Apte ji began to speak in an impartial manner
 kaha bhi ki kabhi aaie baat karte hai
 The conduct of the people of the old generation union will not get a complaint
 2014 ke saal ke baad jis tarah se bijepi ke netaaon ne soshal media par abhadra or aloktantric bhashaa ko yuva kii bechaini kahkar manyata di he usase bilkul alag lagate hai yah log
 Recently, Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta in his Raviwar column of the Times of India justified the language of troll
 apni javaani main apatkaal ke khilaaf jail gaye vitt mantri jetali ne enditivi se baat karte hue kaha ki trol ko nazarandaaj kiijie yaa pachaa lijie
 Look at the profile of abusers on social media
 khulkar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kaa kaaryakarta bataate hai, sanghathan ke pratikon kaa istamaal karte hai or maa-bahan kii gaaliyaan dete hai
 Humbling rumors against anyone spread rumors
 aaj is pachaane or sweekaar karne kii naseehat di ja rahi he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh talks about culture, but how do these leaders recognize in this ideology that grew up in its ideology
 sangh kaise chup rah saktaa he
 Even linguistic aggression is reflected in BJP spokespersons
 jo pravaktaa 2014 se pehle mujhe nirbhik or swatantra patrkaar kaha karte the ve bhi thik se baat nahin karte
 These people kept quiet even when i was abused from broker to my mother
 2005 main bihar chunaavon kii reporting par arun jetali ne meri tarif kii thi or susheel modi patna daftar milane aae the
 i could not even meet Sushil Modi in this election while the whole world went to interview him
 kiran bedi ke intervyuu se khaufjada the yaa susheel ji bhi kisi katutaa ke shikaar ho gaye, mujhe pataa nahin
 Nor do i want to know now
 ek vakt tha jab prakaash jaavdekar jaise bade netaa apni tamaam vyasttaaon ke bich mere kaarykram ke liye vakt nikaalte the
 He used to praise and answer strict questions with complete sanity
 jaavdekar sahab sneh se raavish bulaate the
 Then there was the UPA government
 tab dilli main shila dikshit kii sarkaar hua karti thi, jiske daavon ko maine raveesh kii report main khokhla sabit kar diya tha
 Then many of today's spokesmen used to message me that you have not called for a long time
 main yah baat bulaane yaa aane ke liye nahin likh rahaa
 They are also not coming
 mujhe latayin dilli ke taqatvar logon ke bich ghoomane kii chahat hi nahin he
 Never been jaahir he pravaktaa soshal media ke lafangon kii parvaah kar rahe hote hai jo ek fouj kii shakl main din raat kuch patrakaron ko gaaliyaan dete hai
 Barkha Dutt has been called Mort and i am 100 percent Mort
 shukr he in dinon main kisi raajnneetik pravaktaa ke saath prime time nahin kar rahaa, varna roj aise vyavhaaron kii pratikriya main uttejit hokar yaa aahat hokar ghar lautataa tha
 How the Sangh's old pracharaks would have been comfortable amid such an aggressive political style, it is difficult to say, until there is no public criticism about this upscale
 in sawaalon ko lekar ek din sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se sidhe-sidhe sawaal karne kaa iraadaa jarur he
 If they did not even call then there is nothing
 mujhe riject hone kii puraani aadat he
 i will write a public letter to Mohan Bhagwat one day
 mujhe yakeen he is apsamskruti ke khilaaf ve karrwai karenge or aise huddangiyon ko apane se alag karne kaa saahas dikhaaenge
 i will try to be like this at my level! i am a stubborn man, i will lose but i will fight, that too alone
 main apte ji ke bare main likhte-likhte yah baat kyon likh gaya
 Because in this era, courtesy was met after a long time
 mishthachaar bhi kahie
 He was speaking sweetly
 pehali baar phone karne par bhi bina koi sawaal kiye mere sawaal kaa jawaab dene lage
 Whether or not they listened properly but i said that i am a critic of the Sangh
 phir bhi ve baat kiye ja rahe the
 'no one knew then, there was a young man in Assam
 ek-ek kar logon se baat kii
 Madhusudan Das was an MLA of Praja Socialist Party
 ve gramin or kisaan netaa the
 Talking to him increased political contact
 phir assam main ghuspaith ke sawaalon par baat hone lagi
 For this i went to Shillong, then the capital of Assam used to be Shillong
 ' shilong kii rajdhani se ve janaganana kii report lekar aae
 Explained to Madhusudan ji and for the first time a committee was formed against infiltration in Assam
 kamaal kaa kissa sunaaya
 Did not even mention things that are not coats main kisi adrishy kalpana main kho gaya
 Today, there is a competition for those who take credit for the success of Assam, but how should a person who has gone from Nagpur to Assam at the age of 24 years feel
 phone par unki aawaaj se laga bhi nahin ki is jeet par unka daawa he
 Koi Sethi, who was taking credit in the media for social media management and strategy
 hansi aa gai mujhe
 Apte said that many of the RSS pracharaks were murdered by the militants, yet they persisted
 agar aisa he to sangh ke is yogadan ko sweekruti milani chahie
 Where does loyalty come from the pracharaks of the Sangh, how do they win this allegiance from the Sangh to the BJP, is the BJP their political home? i know some answers, but questions should be asked, this gives a new answer
 apte ji jaise prachaarkon ke saath sattar saal kii mehnat kaa nateeja aayaa he to yah log jashn main kyon nahin shaamil hai
 He told his colleague Himanshu to go and see Sangh's office in Guwahati
 video main dekh rahaa tha shankar das ji baat kar rahe the
 There is no color in the office, no spectacle
 aisa laga jaise iske liye na to mehnat kii or na hi yah jo satta ai he unki he
 Old people of the Sangh talk in a close manner when going close
 mujhase bhi baat karte hai or gaali nahin dete hai
 That is why a big publicist did not disconnect the phone
 parichay bataate hi yah nahin kaha ki aap mere virdohi hai
 Mothers and sisters were not abused like those who claimed to be Sanghis on social media
 mujhe to ab yah gaali aisi hakeekat lagati he ki aisa lagata he ki kahin mohan bhagwat ji se kisi din milane jaaun or ve dekhte hi gaali na bak den yaa unke saath kaa koi haath na uthaa de
 Jumma-jumma had not been in journalism even for two years
 do din tak dilli ke sangh mukhyalay main jaakar din-raat prachaarkon kii dincharya shoot kar lee thi
 It was easy to meet Sudarshanji, the then Union chief
 yah bataakar ki main sangh ko aalochanatmak nigaah se dekhtaa hum
 i thought maybe that Sangh is no longer there, but started talking to Apte that it is still there
 us daur ke ek pravaktaa in dinon pahachaanate tak nahin
 When we met in the book fair, even after shaking hands, we went like never seen
 tab ve apni car main lassi pilaane le jate the
 Well, that big campaigner openly told the accounts of the Sangh's work
 main aksar logon se kahata hum sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa hi nahin he ki sangh ke kaary kya hai
 All criticisms are based on old information
 sirf nafrat karnaa usee tarah kii aloktantrikta he jaisi yah gaali dene vaale karte hai or gaali dene waalon ko uchit tehraane vaale karte hai
 How many organizations of the Union run
 doctor se lekar vakil tak main or adhikariyon ke bich, kya sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa he? One thing affects the people of the Sangh, they are not lazy
 varna assam main 590 saraswati shishu mandir ek din main or sapane dekhne se nahin ban jate
 Four and a half thousand schools with one teacher do not open
 chaahe jaise bhi ho sangh ne yah kaam to kiya he
 Now i will criticize only after knowing what is taught in those schools and how it is taught
 in shikshakon ke paanch hajaar ke maandey kii vyavastha karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Only seven thousand health workers of Seva Bharati work in Assam
 congress kaa seva dal mukhyalay main jhanda fahraane kaa kaam karata he
 It is okay that all other organizations and ngos do this kind of work, but which political party has a Sangh and a multidimensional power organization like the Sangh? Could not the people of Sevadal go from village to village during this drought period? desh bhar main sangh ke jitne sanghathan or shakhaaen hai uskaa ek mukhyalay nahin ho saktaa
 How many people will be there within Nagpur who will monitor or discuss so much work
 mujhe yah sawaal ek jigyaasu patrkaar ke nazariye se hairat main daalate hai
 The Sangh may call itself a social organization, but why does the sweat of its resources and campaigners work for any one political party? People of the Sangh will start giving examples of support of many parties in the past, but for the last two decades only and only BJP is getting their benefit
 tabhi to pradhanmantri or unka mantrimandal sangh ko report dene pahunchataa he
 The politics of Hindutva and the Hinduisation of politics, we ignore these things in the excitement of victory of any party, but it will one day undermine the democracy within our politics
 jis tarah khuleam dharmik sansthaanon or ashramon kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he usase ek din har mahant kii ek party hogi yaa har ashram kaa koi rajya sabha main hoga
 Adityanath is there in the Lok Sabha, there are two more sadhvi-sadhus
 gayatri parivaar ke pandya ji ne rajya sabha kaa prastaav thukraa diya magar prastaav mila to tha
 The Bharatiya Janata Party did not do well by forming a party of the Idawa community in Kerala
 yah ek tarah se raajnneeti main outsorcing kaa nayaa udhaaharan he
 If you do not get the vote yourself, then make a separate party of the people of that community and seek it through the Mahant
 raajnneetik dal ko hameshaa apane kaaryakramon ke boote aage badhanaa chahie
 a Sangh leader said that sessions are held in Assam like in a monastery
 dhai sau satr hai jinke paas apni jaminen hai or jinke kuch hisson par bangladeshi musalamaanon ne kabja kar liya he
 The heads of these sessions are called Empowerments
 is baar in sabhi satradhikaron ko apane paale main laayaa gaya taaki inke bheetar bhakthi, sangeet or samskruti kaa prashikshan lene aane vaale hindu pahchaan kii raajnneeti kaa saath de saken
 They are also hurt by the slogan of a union-free India
 magar bharat kii raajnneeti main punjab se shuru hua party or ashramon kaa complex banane kaa yah khel ab kahin zyada thos ho chukaa he
 During the Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP went into the 'dera Sacha Sauda' with many of its candidates, where the police of their government cannot go even today
 pehle aashirwad maanga jaataa tha ab yah guru, mahant yaa satradhikaar kisi raajnneetik dal ke mahasachiv kii tarah vot maangane or jutaney kaa kaam karne lage hai
 BJP is also doing this work, Congress has been doing it somewhere and regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee too
 is dharmik raajnneetik complex ke khatre par koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 i am often disturbed by the difference between the simplicity of campaigners and the richness of current politics
 sangh kii mehnat se bijepi ko jeet mili he lekin bijepi kii jeet yaa uski raajnneetik samskruti main sangh kii saadagi kyon nahin he
 How does the Sangh digest it, does it digest it as Jaitley ji is advising us to digest the culture of trolls
 kya yah sawaal sangh se nahin poocha jaae ki aapke prachaarkon kii saadagi se congressi samskruti ke sam,daam, arth, dand or bhed ke rup bijepi main kaise hai? uttarakhand main kya hua? kahin aap bhi is sampannataa ke labhaarthi to nahin hai? kahin aisa to nahin ki sangh kii saadagi tabhi kaam kii jab bijepi ne isamen shahkharchi vaale chunavi prabandhan kaa chhaunk daalaa? kya bijepi ke akut sansadhano ke bina sangh kii nishtha raajnneetik jeet dilaa sakati he? agar prachaarak bijepi ko satta tak pahunchane main safal rahe to raajnneetik samskruti ko vaibhav se bachaane main kaise asafal rah gaye
 Many ministerial leaders swear by the Sangh, but their silk kurtas and shawls cost more than a year's expenses for a pracharak
 gaadi kii keemat isamen shaamil nahin he
 If BJP could not be there like Sangh, then what can be said that Sangh has become like BJP? is bhayaavah antar ko apte ji jaise prachaarak kaise pachaa lete honge? chunavi raajnneeti ke liye itnaa paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he, itane helicopter kahaan se aa rahe hai
 When the Sangh pracharaks would have turned a blind eye to these things, what would they have seen? unke hi kitne prachaarak bijepi main pravaktaa or mahasachiv banate hi kitni teji se saadagi chhod dete hai
 Is this a way for them to reach simplicity, an excuse? It is a victory or defeat of the Sangh
 nisandeh assam kii jeet sangh ke anginat prachaarkon kii mehnat kaa nateeja he
 This effort is also commendable because before this one victory, they have gone through a thousand defeats
 itani haaron ke bich apane yakeen par tike rahe
 Just saying that the unions will create a free India is not enough
 kehane waalon ko pehle yah to pataa ho ki bharat main kahaan-kahaan kis str par sangh maujuud he
 The Sangh is not an affection for the Modi government
 vah modi sarkaar se pehle se he or uske baad bhi rahegaa
 The union has proved this
 raajnneetik aalochak sirf itnaa bataa den ki kya ve satta main rahete hue is tarah kaa raajnneetik sanghathan khadaa kar sake hai jahaan unke vaicharik aadarshon ko lekar aise log hon jo 24 saal kii umr main avadh tirhut express se guwahati chale jaaen, jaise apte ji chale gaye the
 i congratulated Apte and also congratulated the big publicist who asked not to be named, but told the work completed
 baatcheet main laga nahin ki kisi sawaal se batch rahe hon yaa chipa rahe hon
 i liked it apte ji shukriya or phir se badhai
 The celebration of bjp's victory did not come in their way
 apte ji nirvikaar dhang se bataane lage
 Said that sometime let's talk
 puraani peedi ke sangh ke logon ke aacharan se shikaayat nahin milegi
 After the year of 2014, these people seem completely different from the way BJP leaders have recognized the vulgar and undemocratic language on social media as the restlessness of the youth
 haal hi main rajya sabha sadsy swapan dasgupta ne times aaf india ke apane ravivaariya kollam main trol yani gaali galouj kii bhashaa ko jaij tehraaya
 Jaitley, who was jailed against the Emergency in his youth, while talking to NDTV said that ignore or troll the troll
 aap soshal media par gaali dene waalon kii profile dekhie
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activist explains, uses the symbols of the organization and abuses the mother-sister
 kisi ke khilaaf anaap shanaap afvaahen failaate hai
 Today, the advice to digest and accept this is being given
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh samskruti kii baat karata he lekin uski vichaardhaara main paley yah netaa kaise is apsamskruti ko manyata dete hai
 How can the union remain silent
 yahaan tak ki bhashaai aakraamakata bhaajapa ke pravaktaaon main bhi dikhti he
 The spokesmen who used to call me bold and independent journalist before 2014 also do not speak properly
 jab mujhe dalal se lekar meri maa tak ko gaaliyaan di gayi tab bhi yah log chup rahe
 i was praised by Arun Jaitley for reporting Bihar elections in 2005 and Sushil Modi came to the Patna office
 is chunaav main main susheel modi tak se nahin mil sakaa jabaki puri duniya unka intervyuu karke chali gai
 Whether i was afraid of Kiran Bedi's interview or Sushil ji fell victim to bitterness, i do not know
 na hi mujhe ab jaananaa he
 There was a time when big leaders like Prakash Javadekar used to take time for my program in the midst of all their engagements
 tarif karte the or puri sanjigdi se sakht sawaalon ke jawaab dete the
 Javadekar sahib used to call Ravish with affection
 tab upie kii sarkaar hua karti thi
 Then there was Sheila Dixit's government in Delhi, whose claims i had proved hollow in Ravish's report
 tab mere sho main aane ke liye aaj ke kai pravaktaa massej karte the ki, bahut dinon se aapane bulaayaa nahin he
 i am not writing to call or come
 vaise aa bhi nahin rahe hai
 i do not want to roam among the powerful people of Latin Delhi
 kabhi nahin rahi
 Apparently, the spokespersons are taking care of the social media bluffs which are abusing some journalists day and night in the shape of an army
 barkhaa dutt ko randi kaha gaya he or mujhe 100 fisadi randi kii aulad
 Thankfully these days i am not doing prime time with any political spokesperson, otherwise i used to return home every day in response to such behavior by getting excited or hurt
 is tarah kii aakraamak raajnneetik style ke bich sangh ke puraane prachaarak kaise sahaj rahete honge, yah kahana mushkil he, jab tak unki is apsamskruti ko lekar koi saarvajanik aalochana nahin aa jaati
 There is definitely an intention to question Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat directly on these questions
 agar unhone bhi nahin bulaayaa to koi baat nahin
 i have an old habit of being rejected
 mohan bhagwat ji ko ek din saarvajanik patr likhuunga
 i am sure that they will take action against this degeneration and show courage to separate such hoodlings from themselves
 main to apane str par aisa hone kaa prayaas karuunga hi! ziddee aadmi hum, haar jaaoongaa magar lard jaaoongaa, vah bhi akelaa
 Why did i write this while writing about Apteji? isliye ki is daur main bahut dinon baad shishtachar se mulaakaat hui
 Also say obedience
 mithe-mithe bol rahe the
 On calling for the first time, i started answering my question without any question
 unhone thik se suna yaa nahin lekin maine kaha ki main sangh kaa aalochak hum
 Still they were being talked about
 'assam main tab koi nahin jaanata tha, noujvaan tha
 Talked to people one by one
 praja socialist party ke ek vidhayak hue the madhusudan das
 He was a rural and peasant leader
 unase baat karte-karte raajnneetik sampark badhaayaa
 Then questions of infiltration started in Assam
 iske liye main shilong gaya, tab assam kii rajdhani shilong hua karti thi
 'they brought census reports from the capital of Shillong
 madhusudan ji ko samajhaayaa or pehali baar assam main ghuspaith ke khilaaf ek cameti bani
 Told the wonderful story
 na kot karne vaali baaten bhi bataayin! i got lost in an invisible fantasy
 aaj assam kii kamyaabi kaa shrey lene waalon kii hode he lekin jo vyakti 24 saal kii umr main nagpur se assam gaya ho use kaisaa lag rahaa hoga
 His voice on the phone did not even indicate that he had a claim on this victory
 koi sethi the, jo media main shrey le rahe the soshal media prabandhan or ranneeti kaa
 i laughed
 apte ji ne bataaya ki aresas ke kai prachaarkon kii ugravadiyon ne hatya kar di phir bhi tike rahe
 If this is the case then this contribution of the Sangh should be approved
 sangh ke prachaarkon main nishtha kahaan se aati he, ve sangh se bijepi main jaakar is nishtha ko kaise jite hai, kya bijepi unka raajnneetik ghar he? kuch to jawaab jaanata hum, magar sawaal poochna chahie, isse nayaa jawaab miltaa he
 The result of the hard work of sixty seventy years of campaigners like Apte ji has come, so why are these people not involved in the celebration apane sahyogi himanshu se kaha ki guwahati main sangh ke karyaalay jaakar dekhie
 Seeing in the video, Shankar Das ji was talking
 karyaalay main koi rang gulaal nahin, koi tamaasha nahin
 It felt as if neither worked for it nor the power that came from it
 najadik jane par sangh ke puraane log dhang se baat karte hai
 Also talk to me and do not abuse
 tabhi to ek bade prachaarak ne phone nahin kaata
 The introduction did not say that you are against me
 soshal media par sanghee hone kaa daawa karne waalon kii tarah maa-bahan kii gaali nahin di
 i feel that this abuse is such a reality now that it seems that Mohan should go to meet Bhagwat someday and that he will not abuse or raise any hand with him
 jumma-jumma do saal bhi nahin hue the patrakarita ke
 For two days, he went to the Union Headquarters in Delhi and shot the day and night routine of the campaigners
 aaraam se tab ke sangh pramukh sudarshan ji se mil letaa tha
 Having said that i look at the Sangh critically
 mujhe laga shaayad ab vah sangh nahin rahaa magar apte ji se baat kar laga ki ab bhi he
 a spokesperson of that era does not even recognize these days
 pustak meley main mili to haath milaane par bhi aise chale gaye jaise kabhi dekha na ho
 Then they used to take lassi in their car
 khayr us bade prachaarak ne sangh ke kaaryon kaa lekha jokha khulkar bataaya
 i often tell people that critics of the Sangh do not know what the Sangh functions are
 sari aalochanaayen puraani jaankaree ke aadhaar par hai 
 Just hating is the same kind of undemocraticism as the abusers and justifying the abusers
 sangh ke kitne sanghathan chalate hai
 From doctors to lawyers and between officials, are the critics of the union aware? sangh ke logon kii ek baat prabhavit karti he, ve aalsee nahin hote
 Varna 590 Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Assam is not built in a day and by dreaming
 ek shikshak vaale saadhe chaar hajaar skool nahin khul jate
 In any case, the Sangh has done this work
 ab un skulon main kya padhaayaa jaataa he or kaise padhaayaa jaataa he ise jaanane par hi aalochana karuunga
 It is not easy to arrange honorarium of five thousand of these teachers
 sirf assam main seva bharti ke saat hajaar health varkar kaam karte hai
 The Congress's Seva Dal does the flag hoisting at headquarters
 thik he ki is tarah ke kaary tamaam anya sanghathan or enjio karte hai magar kya kis raajnneetik dal ke paas sangh he or sangh jaisaa bahuaiami satta sanghathan? kya sevadal ke log is sookhe ke daur main gaanv-gaanv jaakar seva nahin kar sakate the
 The organization and branches of the association across the country cannot have a headquarters
 nagpur ke bheetar kitne log honge jo itane kaamon par najar rakhte honge yaa charchaa karte honge
 i find this question surprising from the perspective of a curious journalist
 sangh lakh apane aapako saamaajik sanghathan kah le, lekin uske sansadhano or prachaarkon ke shram kaa pasinaa kisi ek raajnneetik dal ke kyon kaam aata he? sangh ke log ateet main kai dalon ke samarthan ke udhaaharan dene lagenge lekin pichley do dashakon se unka laabh sirf or sirf bijepi ko mil rahaa he
 That is when the Prime Minister and his cabinet arrive to report to the Union
 hindutv kii raajnneeti or raajnneeti kaa hindookaran in baton ko ham kisi dal kii jeet ke utsaah main nazarandaaj kar dete hai magar yah hamaari raajnneeti ke bheetar kii loktantrikta ko ek din kamjor kar degaa
 The way religious institutions and ashrams are openly being used politically, one day every Mahant will have a party or every ashram will have a Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main adityanath to hai hi, ek do or sadhvi-sadhu hai
 Pandya ji of Gayatri family rejected the proposal of Rajya Sabha but the proposal was received
 bhartiya janata party ne kerala main idava samudaay kii party banaavkar acha kadam nahin uthaaya
 This is in a way a new example of outsourcing in politics
 khud vot nahin milegaa to us samudaay ke logon kii alag se party banavaa do or mahant ke jariye saadh lo
 a political party should always go ahead on its own schedule
 sangh ke ek netaa ne bataaya ki assam main math kii tarah satr hote hai
 There are two and a half hundred Sessions who have their own lands and parts of which have been occupied by Bangladeshi Muslims
 in satron ke pramukhon ko satradhikaar kehete hai
 This time, all these officers were brought in their court so that the Hindus who came for training of devotion, music and culture within them, could support the politics of identity
 sangh mukt bharat kaa naaraa lagane se ve aahat bhi hai
 But in India's politics, this game of building a complex of party and ashrams started from Punjab has become more solid now
 haryana vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bijepi apane kai ummidavaaron ko lekar 'deraa sachcha sauda' ke bheetar chali gai, jahaan unki sarkaar kii police aaj bhi nahin ja sakati he
 Earlier blessings were sought, now this guru, mahant or general secretary has started demanding and raising votes like the general secretary of any political party
 yah kaam bijepi bhi kar rahi he, kahin congress bhi karti rahi he or mamata banerjee jaisi kshetreey netri bhi
 Nobody is talking about the danger of this religious political complex
 main aksar prachaarkon kii saadagi or maujuuda raajnneeti kii sampannataa ke antar se pareshaan hota hum
 The BJP has won by the hard work of the Sangh, but why is there no simplicity of the Sangh in the bjp's victory or its political culture
 sangh ise kaise pachaa letaa he, kya vah bhi vaise hi pachaa letaa he jaise jetali ji hamen trol kii samskruti pachaa lene kii salaah de rahe hai
 Should this question not be asked to the Sangh, how the simplicity of your campaigners is in the form of the content, price, meaning, punishment and distinction of Congress culture in BJP? What happened in Uttarakhand? Are you also the beneficiary of this prosperity? Is it not that the simplicity of the Sangh worked only when the BJP threw the electoral management in it? Can the Sangh's loyalty lead to political victory without the bjp's enormous resources? If the pracharaks were successful in bringing the BJP to power, then how did they fail to save the political culture from glory
 kai mantri netaa sangh kii kasam khate hai magar unke silk kaa kurta or shawl kii keemat ek prachaarak ke saal bhar ke kharche se zyada hota he
 The price of the car is not included
 sangh kii tarah bijepi nahin ho saki to kya kaha ja saktaa he ki bijepi kii tarah sangh ho gaya he?tippaniyan How would a preacher like Apte digest this dreadful difference? Where is so much money coming from for electoral politics, where are so many helicopters coming from? jab sangh ke prachaarak in baton se ankhen moond lete honge to unhen kya dikhataa hoga
 How many of his campaigners leave simplicity as soon as they become spokespersons and general secretaries in BJP
 kya unke liye yah saadagi sampannataa tak pahunchane kaa rasta he, ek bahaanaa he? yah sangh kii jeet he yaa uski haar he
 Undoubtedly, the victory of Assam is the result of the hard work of countless Sangh pracharaks
 yah mehnat isliye bhi saraahneey he ki is ek jeet ke pehle ve hajaar haar se gujarey hai
 Stayed on your faith among so many defeats
 sirf yah kah dena ki sangh mukt bharat banaaenge, kaaphi nahin he
 Those who say this must first know at what level in India the Sangh exists
 sangh modi sarkaar kaa mohataaj nahin he
 He is already with the Modi government and will remain thereafter
 sangh ne yah sabit kiya he
 Political critics can only tell whether they have been able to create such a political organization while in power, where there are people with their ideological ideals who go to Guwahati by the Awadh Tirhut Express at the age of 24, as Apte has left
 Were
 maine apte ji ko badhai di or us bade prachaarak ko bhi badhai di jinhone naam na bataane ke liye kaha, magar kaam puraa bataaya
 It was not thought in the conversation that they were avoiding or hiding any questions
 mujhe yah baat pasand ai
 Thank you Apte and congratulations again
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh samskruti kii baat karata he lekin uski vichaardhaara main paley yah netaa kaise is apsamskruti ko manyata dete hai
 How can the union remain silent
 yahaan tak ki bhashaai aakraamakata bhaajapa ke pravaktaaon main bhi dikhti he
 The spokesmen who used to call me bold and independent journalist before 2014 also do not speak properly
 jab mujhe dalal se lekar meri maa tak ko gaaliyaan di gayi tab bhi yah log chup rahe
 i was praised by Arun Jaitley for reporting Bihar elections in 2005 and Sushil Modi came to the Patna office
 is chunaav main main susheel modi tak se nahin mil sakaa jabaki puri duniya unka intervyuu karke chali gai
 Whether i was afraid of Kiran Bedi's interview or Sushil ji fell victim to bitterness, i do not know
 na hi mujhe ab jaananaa he
 There was a time when big leaders like Prakash Javadekar used to take time for my program in the midst of all their engagements
 tarif karte the or puri sanjigdi se sakht sawaalon ke jawaab dete the
 Javadekar sahib used to call Ravish with affection
 tab upie kii sarkaar hua karti thi
 Then there was Sheila Dixit's government in Delhi, whose claims i had proved hollow in Ravish's report
 tab mere sho main aane ke liye aaj ke kai pravaktaa massej karte the ki, bahut dinon se aapane bulaayaa nahin he
 i am not writing to call or come
 vaise aa bhi nahin rahe hai
 i do not want to roam among the powerful people of Latin Delhi
 kabhi nahin rahi
 Apparently, the spokespersons are taking care of the social media bluffs which are abusing some journalists day and night in the shape of an army
 barkhaa dutt ko randi kaha gaya he or mujhe 100 fisadi randi kii aulad
 Thankfully these days i am not doing prime time with any political spokesperson, otherwise i used to return home every day in response to such behavior by getting excited or hurt
 is tarah kii aakraamak raajnneetik style ke bich sangh ke puraane prachaarak kaise sahaj rahete honge, yah kahana mushkil he, jab tak unki is apsamskruti ko lekar koi saarvajanik aalochana nahin aa jaati
 There is definitely an intention to question Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat directly on these questions
 agar unhone bhi nahin bulaayaa to koi baat nahin
 i have an old habit of being rejected
 mohan bhagwat ji ko ek din saarvajanik patr likhuunga
 i am sure that they will take action against this degeneration and show courage to separate such hoodlings from themselves
 main to apane str par aisa hone kaa prayaas karuunga hi! ziddee aadmi hum, haar jaaoongaa magar lard jaaoongaa, vah bhi akelaa
 Why did i write this while writing about Apteji? isliye ki is daur main bahut dinon baad shishtachar se mulaakaat hui
 Also say obedience
 mithe-mithe bol rahe the
 On calling for the first time, i started answering my question without any question
 unhone thik se suna yaa nahin lekin maine kaha ki main sangh kaa aalochak hum
 Still they were being talked about
 'assam main tab koi nahin jaanata tha, noujvaan tha
 Talked to people one by one
 praja socialist party ke ek vidhayak hue the madhusudan das
 He was a rural and peasant leader
 unase baat karte-karte raajnneetik sampark badhaayaa
 Then questions of infiltration started in Assam
 iske liye main shilong gaya, tab assam kii rajdhani shilong hua karti thi
 'they brought census reports from the capital of Shillong
 madhusudan ji ko samajhaayaa or pehali baar assam main ghuspaith ke khilaaf ek cameti bani
 Told the wonderful story
 na kot karne vaali baaten bhi bataayin! i got lost in an invisible fantasy
 aaj assam kii kamyaabi kaa shrey lene waalon kii hode he lekin jo vyakti 24 saal kii umr main nagpur se assam gaya ho use kaisaa lag rahaa hoga
 His voice on the phone did not even indicate that he had a claim on this victory
 koi sethi the, jo media main shrey le rahe the soshal media prabandhan or ranneeti kaa
 i laughed
 apte ji ne bataaya ki aresas ke kai prachaarkon kii ugravadiyon ne hatya kar di phir bhi tike rahe
 If this is the case then this contribution of the Sangh should be approved
 sangh ke prachaarkon main nishtha kahaan se aati he, ve sangh se bijepi main jaakar is nishtha ko kaise jite hai, kya bijepi unka raajnneetik ghar he? kuch to jawaab jaanata hum, magar sawaal poochna chahie, isse nayaa jawaab miltaa he
 The result of the hard work of sixty seventy years of campaigners like Apte ji has come, so why are these people not involved in the celebration apane sahyogi himanshu se kaha ki guwahati main sangh ke karyaalay jaakar dekhie
 Seeing in the video, Shankar Das ji was talking
 karyaalay main koi rang gulaal nahin, koi tamaasha nahin
 It felt as if neither worked for it nor the power that came from it
 najadik jane par sangh ke puraane log dhang se baat karte hai
 Also talk to me and do not abuse
 tabhi to ek bade prachaarak ne phone nahin kaata
 The introduction did not say that you are against me
 soshal media par sanghee hone kaa daawa karne waalon kii tarah maa-bahan kii gaali nahin di
 i feel that this abuse is such a reality now that it seems that Mohan should go to meet Bhagwat someday and that he will not abuse or raise any hand with him
 jumma-jumma do saal bhi nahin hue the patrakarita ke
 For two days, he went to the Union Headquarters in Delhi and shot the day and night routine of the campaigners
 aaraam se tab ke sangh pramukh sudarshan ji se mil letaa tha
 Having said that i look at the Sangh critically
 mujhe laga shaayad ab vah sangh nahin rahaa magar apte ji se baat kar laga ki ab bhi he
 a spokesperson of that era does not even recognize these days
 pustak meley main mili to haath milaane par bhi aise chale gaye jaise kabhi dekha na ho
 Then they used to take lassi in their car
 khayr us bade prachaarak ne sangh ke kaaryon kaa lekha jokha khulkar bataaya
 i often tell people that critics of the Sangh do not know what the Sangh functions are
 sari aalochanaayen puraani jaankaree ke aadhaar par hai 
 Just hating is the same kind of undemocraticism as the abusers and justifying the abusers
 sangh ke kitne sanghathan chalate hai
 From doctors to lawyers and between officials, are the critics of the union aware? sangh ke logon kii ek baat prabhavit karti he, ve aalsee nahin hote
 Varna 590 Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Assam is not built in a day and by dreaming
 ek shikshak vaale saadhe chaar hajaar skool nahin khul jate
 In any case, the Sangh has done this work
 ab un skulon main kya padhaayaa jaataa he or kaise padhaayaa jaataa he ise jaanane par hi aalochana karuunga
 It is not easy to arrange honorarium of five thousand of these teachers
 sirf assam main seva bharti ke saat hajaar health varkar kaam karte hai
 The Congress's Seva Dal does the flag hoisting at headquarters
 thik he ki is tarah ke kaary tamaam anya sanghathan or enjio karte hai magar kya kis raajnneetik dal ke paas sangh he or sangh jaisaa bahuaiami satta sanghathan? kya sevadal ke log is sookhe ke daur main gaanv-gaanv jaakar seva nahin kar sakate the
 The organization and branches of the association across the country cannot have a headquarters
 nagpur ke bheetar kitne log honge jo itane kaamon par najar rakhte honge yaa charchaa karte honge
 i find this question surprising from the perspective of a curious journalist
 sangh lakh apane aapako saamaajik sanghathan kah le, lekin uske sansadhano or prachaarkon ke shram kaa pasinaa kisi ek raajnneetik dal ke kyon kaam aata he? sangh ke log ateet main kai dalon ke samarthan ke udhaaharan dene lagenge lekin pichley do dashakon se unka laabh sirf or sirf bijepi ko mil rahaa he
 That is when the Prime Minister and his cabinet arrive to report to the Union
 hindutv kii raajnneeti or raajnneeti kaa hindookaran in baton ko ham kisi dal kii jeet ke utsaah main nazarandaaj kar dete hai magar yah hamaari raajnneeti ke bheetar kii loktantrikta ko ek din kamjor kar degaa
 The way religious institutions and ashrams are openly being used politically, one day every Mahant will have a party or every ashram will have a Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main adityanath to hai hi, ek do or sadhvi-sadhu hai
 Pandya ji of Gayatri family rejected the proposal of Rajya Sabha but the proposal was received
 bhartiya janata party ne kerala main idava samudaay kii party banaavkar acha kadam nahin uthaaya
 This is in a way a new example of outsourcing in politics
 khud vot nahin milegaa to us samudaay ke logon kii alag se party banavaa do or mahant ke jariye saadh lo
 a political party should always go ahead on its own schedule
 sangh ke ek netaa ne bataaya ki assam main math kii tarah satr hote hai
 There are two and a half hundred Sessions who have their own lands and parts of which have been occupied by Bangladeshi Muslims
 in satron ke pramukhon ko satradhikaar kehete hai
 This time, all these officers were brought in their court so that the Hindus who came for training of devotion, music and culture within them, could support the politics of identity
 sangh mukt bharat kaa naaraa lagane se ve aahat bhi hai
 But in India's politics, this game of building a complex of party and ashrams started from Punjab has become more solid now
 haryana vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bijepi apane kai ummidavaaron ko lekar 'deraa sachcha sauda' ke bheetar chali gai, jahaan unki sarkaar kii police aaj bhi nahin ja sakati he
 Earlier blessings were sought, now this guru, mahant or general secretary has started demanding and raising votes like the general secretary of any political party
 yah kaam bijepi bhi kar rahi he, kahin congress bhi karti rahi he or mamata banerjee jaisi kshetreey netri bhi
 Nobody is talking about the danger of this religious political complex
 main aksar prachaarkon kii saadagi or maujuuda raajnneeti kii sampannataa ke antar se pareshaan hota hum
 The BJP has won by the hard work of the Sangh, but why is there no simplicity of the Sangh in the bjp's victory or its political culture
 sangh ise kaise pachaa letaa he, kya vah bhi vaise hi pachaa letaa he jaise jetali ji hamen trol kii samskruti pachaa lene kii salaah de rahe hai
 Should this question not be asked to the Sangh, how the simplicity of your campaigners is in the form of the content, price, meaning, punishment and distinction of Congress culture in BJP? What happened in Uttarakhand? Are you also the beneficiary of this prosperity? Is it not that the simplicity of the Sangh worked only when the BJP threw the electoral management in it? Can the Sangh's loyalty lead to political victory without the bjp's enormous resources? If the pracharaks were successful in bringing the BJP to power, then how did they fail to save the political culture from glory
 kai mantri netaa sangh kii kasam khate hai magar unke silk kaa kurta or shawl kii keemat ek prachaarak ke saal bhar ke kharche se zyada hota he
 The price of the car is not included
 sangh kii tarah bijepi nahin ho saki to kya kaha ja saktaa he ki bijepi kii tarah sangh ho gaya he?tippaniyan How would a preacher like Apte digest this dreadful difference? Where is so much money coming from for electoral politics, where are so many helicopters coming from? jab sangh ke prachaarak in baton se ankhen moond lete honge to unhen kya dikhataa hoga
 How many of his campaigners leave simplicity as soon as they become spokespersons and general secretaries in BJP
 kya unke liye yah saadagi sampannataa tak pahunchane kaa rasta he, ek bahaanaa he? yah sangh kii jeet he yaa uski haar he
 Nisn body is the result of hard work of countless preachers victory Association of Assam
 yah mehnat isliye bhi saraahneey he ki is ek jeet ke pehle ve hajaar haar se gujarey hai
 Stayed on your faith among so many defeats
 sirf yah kah dena ki sangh mukt bharat banaaenge, kaaphi nahin he
 Those who say this must first know at what level in India the Sangh exists
 sangh modi sarkaar kaa mohataaj nahin he
 He is already with the Modi government and will remain thereafter
 sangh ne yah sabit kiya he
 Political critics can only tell whether they have been able to create such a political organization while in power, where there are people with their ideological ideals who go to Guwahati by the Awadh Tirhut Express at the age of 24, as Apte has left
 Were
 maine apte ji ko badhai di or us bade prachaarak ko bhi badhai di jinhone naam na bataane ke liye kaha, magar kaam puraa bataaya
 It was not thought in the conversation that they were avoiding or hiding any questions
 mujhe yah baat pasand ai
 Thank you Apte and congratulations again
 main apte ji ke bare main likhte-likhte yah baat kyon likh gaya
 Because in this era, courtesy was met after a long time
 mishthachaar bhi kahie
 He was speaking sweetly
 pehali baar phone karne par bhi bina koi sawaal kiye mere sawaal kaa jawaab dene lage
 Whether or not they listened properly but i said that i am a critic of the Sangh
 phir bhi ve baat kiye ja rahe the
 'no one knew then, there was a young man in Assam
 ek-ek kar logon se baat kii
 Madhusudan Das was an MLA of Praja Socialist Party
 ve gramin or kisaan netaa the
 Talking to him increased political contact
 phir assam main ghuspaith ke sawaalon par baat hone lagi
 For this i went to Shillong, then the capital of Assam used to be Shillong
 ' shilong kii rajdhani se ve janaganana kii report lekar aae
 Explained to Madhusudan ji and for the first time a committee was formed against infiltration in Assam
 kamaal kaa kissa sunaaya
 Did not even mention things that are not coats main kisi adrishy kalpana main kho gaya
 Today, there is a competition for those who take credit for the success of Assam, but how should a person who has gone from Nagpur to Assam at the age of 24 years feel
 phone par unki aawaaj se laga bhi nahin ki is jeet par unka daawa he
 Koi Sethi, who was taking credit in the media for social media management and strategy
 hansi aa gai mujhe
 Apte said that many of the RSS pracharaks were murdered by the militants, yet they persisted
 agar aisa he to sangh ke is yogadan ko sweekruti milani chahie
 Where does loyalty come from the pracharaks of the Sangh, how do they win this allegiance from the Sangh to the BJP, is the BJP their political home? i know some answers, but questions should be asked, this gives a new answer
 apte ji jaise prachaarkon ke saath sattar saal kii mehnat kaa nateeja aayaa he to yah log jashn main kyon nahin shaamil hai
 He told his colleague Himanshu to go and see Sangh's office in Guwahati
 video main dekh rahaa tha shankar das ji baat kar rahe the
 There is no color in the office, no spectacle
 aisa laga jaise iske liye na to mehnat kii or na hi yah jo satta ai he unki he
 Old people of the Sangh talk in a close manner when going close
 mujhase bhi baat karte hai or gaali nahin dete hai
 That is why a big publicist did not disconnect the phone
 parichay bataate hi yah nahin kaha ki aap mere virdohi hai
 Mothers and sisters were not abused like those who claimed to be Sanghis on social media
 mujhe to ab yah gaali aisi hakeekat lagati he ki aisa lagata he ki kahin mohan bhagwat ji se kisi din milane jaaun or ve dekhte hi gaali na bak den yaa unke saath kaa koi haath na uthaa de
 Jumma-jumma had not been in journalism even for two years
 do din tak dilli ke sangh mukhyalay main jaakar din-raat prachaarkon kii dincharya shoot kar lee thi
 It was easy to meet Sudarshanji, the then Union chief
 yah bataakar ki main sangh ko aalochanatmak nigaah se dekhtaa hum
 i thought maybe that Sangh is no longer there, but started talking to Apte that it is still there
 us daur ke ek pravaktaa in dinon pahachaanate tak nahin
 When we met in the book fair, even after shaking hands, we went like never seen
 tab ve apni car main lassi pilaane le jate the
 Well, that big campaigner openly told the accounts of the Sangh's work
 main aksar logon se kahata hum sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa hi nahin he ki sangh ke kaary kya hai
 All criticisms are based on old information
 sirf nafrat karnaa usee tarah kii aloktantrikta he jaisi yah gaali dene vaale karte hai or gaali dene waalon ko uchit tehraane vaale karte hai
 How many organizations of the Union run
 doctor se lekar vakil tak main or adhikariyon ke bich, kya sangh ke aalochakon ko pataa he? One thing affects the people of the Sangh, they are not lazy
 varna assam main 590 saraswati shishu mandir ek din main or sapane dekhne se nahin ban jate
 Four and a half thousand schools with one teacher do not open
 chaahe jaise bhi ho sangh ne yah kaam to kiya he
 Now i will criticize only after knowing what is taught in those schools and how it is taught
 in shikshakon ke paanch hajaar ke maandey kii vyavastha karnaa aasaan nahin he
 Only seven thousand health workers of Seva Bharati work in Assam
 congress kaa seva dal mukhyalay main jhanda fahraane kaa kaam karata he
 It is okay that all other organizations and ngos do this kind of work, but which political party has a Sangh and a multidimensional power organization like the Sangh? Could not the people of Sevadal go from village to village during this drought period? desh bhar main sangh ke jitne sanghathan or shakhaaen hai uskaa ek mukhyalay nahin ho saktaa
 How many people will be there within Nagpur who will monitor or discuss so much work
 mujhe yah sawaal ek jigyaasu patrkaar ke nazariye se hairat main daalate hai
 The Sangh may call itself a social organization, but why does the sweat of its resources and campaigners work for any one political party? People of the Sangh will start giving examples of support of many parties in the past, but for the last two decades only and only BJP is getting their benefit
 tabhi to pradhanmantri or unka mantrimandal sangh ko report dene pahunchataa he
 The politics of Hindutva and the Hinduisation of politics, we ignore these things in the excitement of victory of any party, but it will one day undermine the democracy within our politics
 jis tarah khuleam dharmik sansthaanon or ashramon kaa raajnneetik istemaal ho rahaa he usase ek din har mahant kii ek party hogi yaa har ashram kaa koi rajya sabha main hoga
 Adityanath is there in the Lok Sabha, there are two more sadhvi-sadhus
 gayatri parivaar ke pandya ji ne rajya sabha kaa prastaav thukraa diya magar prastaav mila to tha
 The Bharatiya Janata Party did not do well by forming a party of the Idawa community in Kerala
 yah ek tarah se raajnneeti main outsorcing kaa nayaa udhaaharan he
 If you do not get the vote yourself, then make a separate party of the people of that community and seek it through the Mahant
 raajnneetik dal ko hameshaa apane kaaryakramon ke boote aage badhanaa chahie
 a Sangh leader said that sessions are held in Assam like in a monastery
 dhai sau satr hai jinke paas apni jaminen hai or jinke kuch hisson par bangladeshi musalamaanon ne kabja kar liya he
 The heads of these sessions are called Empowerments
 is baar in sabhi satradhikaron ko apane paale main laayaa gaya taaki inke bheetar bhakthi, sangeet or samskruti kaa prashikshan lene aane vaale hindu pahchaan kii raajnneeti kaa saath de saken
 They are also hurt by the slogan of a union-free India
 magar bharat kii raajnneeti main punjab se shuru hua party or ashramon kaa complex banane kaa yah khel ab kahin zyada thos ho chukaa he
 During the Haryana Assembly elections, the BJP went into the 'dera Sacha Sauda' with many of its candidates, where the police of their government cannot go even today
 pehle aashirwad maanga jaataa tha ab yah guru, mahant yaa satradhikaar kisi raajnneetik dal ke mahasachiv kii tarah vot maangane or jutaney kaa kaam karne lage hai
 BJP is also doing this work, Congress has been doing it somewhere and regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee too
 is dharmik raajnneetik complex ke khatre par koi baat nahin kar rahaa he
 i am often disturbed by the difference between the simplicity of campaigners and the richness of current politics
 sangh kii mehnat se bijepi ko jeet mili he lekin bijepi kii jeet yaa uski raajnneetik samskruti main sangh kii saadagi kyon nahin he
 How does the Sangh digest it, does it digest it as Jaitley ji is advising us to digest the culture of trolls
 kya yah sawaal sangh se nahin poocha jaae ki aapke prachaarkon kii saadagi se congressi samskruti ke sam,daam, arth, dand or bhed ke rup bijepi main kaise hai? uttarakhand main kya hua? kahin aap bhi is sampannataa ke labhaarthi to nahin hai? kahin aisa to nahin ki sangh kii saadagi tabhi kaam kii jab bijepi ne isamen shahkharchi vaale chunavi prabandhan kaa chhaunk daalaa? kya bijepi ke akut sansadhano ke bina sangh kii nishtha raajnneetik jeet dilaa sakati he? agar prachaarak bijepi ko satta tak pahunchane main safal rahe to raajnneetik samskruti ko vaibhav se bachaane main kaise asafal rah gaye
 Many ministerial leaders swear by the Sangh, but their silk kurtas and shawls cost more than a year's expenses for a pracharak
 gaadi kii keemat isamen shaamil nahin he
 If BJP could not be there like Sangh, then what can be said that Sangh has become like BJP? is bhayaavah antar ko apte ji jaise prachaarak kaise pachaa lete honge? chunavi raajnneeti ke liye itnaa paisa kahaan se aa rahaa he, itane helicopter kahaan se aa rahe hai
 When the Sangh pracharaks would have turned a blind eye to these things, what would they have seen? unke hi kitne prachaarak bijepi main pravaktaa or mahasachiv banate hi kitni teji se saadagi chhod dete hai
 Is this a way for them to reach simplicity, an excuse? It is a victory or defeat of the Sangh
 nisandeh assam kii jeet sangh ke anginat prachaarkon kii mehnat kaa nateeja he
 This effort is also commendable because before this one victory, they have gone through a thousand defeats
 itani haaron ke bich apane yakeen par tike rahe
 Just saying that the unions will create a free India is not enough
 kehane waalon ko pehle yah to pataa ho ki bharat main kahaan-kahaan kis str par sangh maujuud he
 The Sangh is not an affection for the Modi government
 vah modi sarkaar se pehle se he or uske baad bhi rahegaa
 The union has proved this
 raajnneetik aalochak sirf itnaa bataa den ki kya ve satta main rahete hue is tarah kaa raajnneetik sanghathan khadaa kar sake hai jahaan unke vaicharik aadarshon ko lekar aise log hon jo 24 saal kii umr main avadh tirhut express se guwahati chale jaaen, jaise apte ji chale gaye the
 i congratulated Apte and also congratulated the big publicist who asked not to be named, but told the work completed
 baatcheet main laga nahin ki kisi sawaal se batch rahe hon yaa chipa rahe hon
 i liked it apte ji shukriya or phir se badhai
 i got lost in an invisible fantasy
 aaj assam kii kamyaabi kaa shrey lene waalon kii hode he lekin jo vyakti 24 saal kii umr main nagpur se assam gaya ho use kaisaa lag rahaa hoga
 His voice on the phone did not even indicate that he had a claim on this victory
 koi sethi the, jo media main shrey le rahe the soshal media prabandhan or ranneeti kaa
 i laughed
 apte ji ne bataaya ki aresas ke kai prachaarkon kii ugravadiyon ne hatya kar di phir bhi tike rahe
 If this is the case then this contribution of the Sangh should be approved
 sangh ke prachaarkon main nishtha kahaan se aati he, ve sangh se bijepi main jaakar is nishtha ko kaise jite hai, kya bijepi unka raajnneetik ghar he? kuch to jawaab jaanata hum, magar sawaal poochna chahie, isse nayaa jawaab miltaa he
 The result of the hard work of sixty seventy years of campaigners like Apte ji has come, so why are these people not involved in the celebration apane sahyogi himanshu se kaha ki guwahati main sangh ke karyaalay jaakar dekhie

 Should this question not be asked to the Sangh, how the simplicity of your campaigners is in the form of the content, price, meaning, punishment and distinction of Congress culture in BJP? What happened in Uttarakhand? Are you also the beneficiary of this prosperity? Is it not that the simplicity of the Sangh worked only when the BJP threw the electoral management in it? Can the Sangh's loyalty lead to political victory without the bjp's enormous resources? If the pracharaks were successful in bringing the BJP to power, then how did they fail to save the political culture from glory
 kai mantri netaa sangh kii kasam khate hai magar unke silk kaa kurta or shawl kii keemat ek prachaarak ke saal bhar ke kharche se zyada hota he
 The price of the car is not included
 sangh kii tarah bijepi nahin ho saki to kya kaha ja saktaa he ki bijepi kii tarah sangh ho gaya he?tippaniyan How would a preacher like Apte digest this dreadful difference? Where is so much money coming from for electoral politics, where are so many helicopters coming from? jab sangh ke prachaarak in baton se ankhen moond lete honge to unhen kya dikhataa hoga
 How many of his campaigners leave simplicity as soon as they become spokespersons and general secretaries in BJP
 kya unke liye yah saadagi sampannataa tak pahunchane kaa rasta he, ek bahaanaa he? yah sangh kii jeet he yaa uski haar he
 Undoubtedly, the victory of Assam is the result of the hard work of countless Sangh pracharaks
 yah mehnat isliye bhi saraahneey he ki is ek jeet ke pehle ve hajaar haar se gujarey hai
 Stayed on your faith among so many defeats
 sirf yah kah dena ki sangh mukt bharat banaaenge, kaaphi nahin he
 Those who say this must first know at what level in India the Sangh exists
 sangh modi sarkaar kaa mohataaj nahin he
 He is already with the Modi government and will remain thereafter
 sangh ne yah sabit kiya he
 Political critics can only tell whether they have been able to create such a political organization while in power, where there are people with their ideological ideals who go to Guwahati by the Awadh Tirhut Express at the age of 24, as Apte has left
 Were
 maine apte ji ko badhai di or us bade prachaarak ko bhi badhai di jinhone naam na bataane ke liye kaha, magar kaam puraa bataaya
 It was not thought in the conversation that they were avoiding or hiding any questions
 mujhe yah baat pasand ai
 Thank you Apte and congratulations again
 apte ji ne bataaya ki aresas ke kai prachaarkon kii ugravadiyon ne hatya kar di phir bhi tike rahe
 If this is the case then this contribution of the Sangh should be approved
 sangh ke prachaarkon main nishtha kahaan se aati he, ve sangh se bijepi main jaakar is nishtha ko kaise jite hai, kya bijepi unka raajnneetik ghar he? kuch to jawaab jaanata hum, magar sawaal poochna chahie, isse nayaa jawaab miltaa he
 The result of the hard work of sixty seventy years of campaigners like Apte ji has come, so why are these people not involved in the celebration apane sahyogi himanshu se kaha ki guwahati main sangh ke karyaalay jaakar dekhie
 Seeing in the video, Shankar Das ji was talking
 karyaalay main koi rang gulaal nahin, koi tamaasha nahin
 It felt as if neither worked for it nor the power that came from it
 najadik jane par sangh ke puraane log dhang se baat karte hai
 Also talk to me and do not abuse
 tabhi to ek bade prachaarak ne phone nahin kaata
 The introduction did not say that you are against me
 soshal media par sanghee hone kaa daawa karne waalon kii tarah maa-bahan kii gaali nahin di
 i feel that this abuse is such a reality now that it seems that Mohan should go to meet Bhagwat someday and that he will not abuse or raise any hand with him
 jumma-jumma do saal bhi nahin hue the patrakarita ke
 For two days, he went to the Union Headquarters in Delhi and shot the day and night routine of the campaigners
 aaraam se tab ke sangh pramukh sudarshan ji se mil letaa tha
 Having said that i look at the Sangh critically
 mujhe laga shaayad ab vah sangh nahin rahaa magar apte ji se baat kar laga ki ab bhi he
 a spokesperson of that era does not even recognize these days
 pustak meley main mili to haath milaane par bhi aise chale gaye jaise kabhi dekha na ho
 Then they used to take lassi in their car
 khayr us bade prachaarak ne sangh ke kaaryon kaa lekha jokha khulkar bataaya
 i often tell people that critics of the Sangh do not know what the Sangh functions are
 sari aalochanaayen puraani jaankaree ke aadhaar par hai 
 Just hating is the same kind of undemocraticism as the abusers and justifying the abusers
 sangh ke kitne sanghathan chalate hai
 From doctors to lawyers and between officials, are the critics of the union aware? sangh ke logon kii ek baat prabhavit karti he, ve aalsee nahin hote
 Varna 590 Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Assam is not built in a day and by dreaming
 ek shikshak vaale saadhe chaar hajaar skool nahin khul jate
 In any case, the Sangh has done this work
 ab un skulon main kya padhaayaa jaataa he or kaise padhaayaa jaataa he ise jaanane par hi aalochana karuunga
 It is not easy to arrange honorarium of five thousand of these teachers
 sirf assam main seva bharti ke saat hajaar health varkar kaam karte hai
 The Congress's Seva Dal does the flag hoisting at headquarters
 thik he ki is tarah ke kaary tamaam anya sanghathan or enjio karte hai magar kya kis raajnneetik dal ke paas sangh he or sangh jaisaa bahuaiami satta sanghathan? kya sevadal ke log is sookhe ke daur main gaanv-gaanv jaakar seva nahin kar sakate the
 The organization and branches of the association across the country cannot have a headquarters
 nagpur ke bheetar kitne log honge jo itane kaamon par najar rakhte honge yaa charchaa karte honge
 i find this question surprising from the perspective of a curious journalist
 sangh lakh apane aapako saamaajik sanghathan kah le, lekin uske sansadhano or prachaarkon ke shram kaa pasinaa kisi ek raajnneetik dal ke kyon kaam aata he? sangh ke log ateet main kai dalon ke samarthan ke udhaaharan dene lagenge lekin pichley do dashakon se unka laabh sirf or sirf bijepi ko mil rahaa he
 That is when the Prime Minister and his cabinet arrive to report to the Union
 hindutv kii raajnneeti or raajnneeti kaa hindookaran in baton ko ham kisi dal kii jeet ke utsaah main nazarandaaj kar dete hai magar yah hamaari raajnneeti ke bheetar kii loktantrikta ko ek din kamjor kar degaa
 The way religious institutions and ashrams are openly being used politically, one day every Mahant will have a party or every ashram will have a Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main adityanath to hai hi, ek do or sadhvi-sadhu hai
 Pandya ji of Gayatri family rejected the proposal of Rajya Sabha but the proposal was received
 bhartiya janata party ne kerala main idava samudaay kii party banaavkar acha kadam nahin uthaaya
 This is in a way a new example of outsourcing in politics
 khud vot nahin milegaa to us samudaay ke logon kii alag se party banavaa do or mahant ke jariye saadh lo
 a political party should always go ahead on its own schedule
 sangh ke ek netaa ne bataaya ki assam main math kii tarah satr hote hai
 There are two and a half hundred Sessions who have their own lands and parts of which have been occupied by Bangladeshi Muslims
 in satron ke pramukhon ko satradhikaar kehete hai
 This time, all these officers were brought in their court so that the Hindus who came for training of devotion, music and culture within them, could support the politics of identity
 sangh mukt bharat kaa naaraa lagane se ve aahat bhi hai
 But in India's politics, this game of building a complex of party and ashrams started from Punjab has become more solid now
 haryana vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bijepi apane kai ummidavaaron ko lekar 'deraa sachcha sauda' ke bheetar chali gai, jahaan unki sarkaar kii police aaj bhi nahin ja sakati he
 Earlier blessings were sought, now this guru, mahant or general secretary has started demanding and raising votes like the general secretary of any political party
 yah kaam bijepi bhi kar rahi he, kahin congress bhi karti rahi he or mamata banerjee jaisi kshetreey netri bhi

 hindutv kii raajnneeti or raajnneeti kaa hindookaran in baton ko ham kisi dal kii jeet ke utsaah main nazarandaaj kar dete hai magar yah hamaari raajnneeti ke bheetar kii loktantrikta ko ek din kamjor kar degaa
 The way religious institutions and ashrams are openly being used politically, one day every Mahant will have a party or every ashram will have a Rajya Sabha
 loksabhaa main adityanath to hai hi, ek do or sadhvi-sadhu hai
 Pandya ji of Gayatri family rejected the proposal of Rajya Sabha but the proposal was received
 bhartiya janata party ne kerala main idava samudaay kii party banaavkar acha kadam nahin uthaaya
 This is in a way a new example of outsourcing in politics
 khud vot nahin milegaa to us samudaay ke logon kii alag se party banavaa do or mahant ke jariye saadh lo
 a political party should always go ahead on its own schedule
 sangh ke ek netaa ne bataaya ki assam main math kii tarah satr hote hai
 There are two and a half hundred Sessions who have their own lands and parts of which have been occupied by Bangladeshi Muslims
 in satron ke pramukhon ko satradhikaar kehete hai
 This time, all these officers were brought in their court so that the Hindus who came for training of devotion, music and culture within them, could support the politics of identity
 sangh mukt bharat kaa naaraa lagane se ve aahat bhi hai
 But in India's politics, this game of building a complex of party and ashrams started from Punjab has become more solid now
 haryana vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan bijepi apane kai ummidavaaron ko lekar 'deraa sachcha sauda' ke bheetar chali gai, jahaan unki sarkaar kii police aaj bhi nahin ja sakati he
 Earlier blessings were sought, now this guru, mahant or general secretary has started demanding and raising votes like the general secretary of any political party
 yah kaam bijepi bhi kar rahi he, kahin congress bhi karti rahi he or mamata banerjee jaisi kshetreey netri bhi
 Nobody is talking about the danger of this religious political complex

 Should this question not be asked to the Sangh, how the simplicity of your campaigners is in the form of the content, price, meaning, punishment and distinction of Congress culture in BJP? What happened in Uttarakhand? Are you also the beneficiary of this prosperity? Is it not that the simplicity of the Sangh worked only when the BJP threw the electoral management in it?

 mangalvaar raat ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne raashtra ke naam 'achaanak' tay kiye gaye sandesh main 500 tathaa 1,000 rupee ke noton ko mangalvaar kii ardhratri se hi band kar dene kaa elaan kiya, or kaha ki 500 rupee tathaa 2,000 rupee ke nae note chalaae jaaenge
 As per the announcement, it was also said that existing notes can be run till Friday at hospitals and petrol pumps
 tippaniyan But after this, complaints started coming from many places that even petrol pump owners are refusing to take the current notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, and then on Wednesday the government told the public that if someone with a petrol pump would do so If so, they can tweet and tell them, and help will be provided immediately

 The creation of this rule not only ended the opportunity to complain to the government, but also brought some relief to the customers on the lines of 'something is better than nothing'
 lekin iske baad kai jagah se is tarah kii shikaayatein milane lageen ki petrol pump vaale bhi 500 rupee or 1,000 rupee ke maujuuda noton ko lene se inkaar kar rahe hai, or phir sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko janata se kaha ki agar koi petrol pump vaala aisa karata he, to ve unhen twit kar bataa sakate hai, or turant madad muhaiyaa karwaai jaaegi
 But in the meantime, according to a news from Shimla, the capital of Himachal Pradesh, the petrol pumps there have tried to appease both sides by enforcing the rule that they will accept the existing notes, but for more than Rs 500 Petrol will not be filled in any car

 fatve main muslim mahilaon kaa bazaaron main jaakar yaa kahin bhi gaiyr-maharam mardon se chudiyaan pahanane ko galat qaraar diya he
 In fact, a person from Deoband had asked the Ifta department of Darul Uloom in a written question that we usually have men selling and dressing bangles here
 auraton ko chudiyaan pahanane ke liye ghar se nikalnaa padataa he or apane haath gaiyr mardon ke haathon main dene padate hai
 Is it permissible for women to wear bangles from non-men while leaving the house or staying in the house? In response to this question, the Muktis of Madarul Uloom Deoband said that it is illegal and a crime for a non-maharam male to wear a women's bangle with blood If there is no relationship, women are also forbidden to wear bangles with the hands of such men
 fatve main ise gunaah bataaya gaya he
 Actually, according to Islamic Sharia, a Muslim woman has to cover every man with whom she does not have blood relations
 isi daleel ke aadhaar par fatwa dene vaali body daarul iftaa ne ye jawaab jari kiya he
 In this fatwa, it has also been clarified that wearing dolls is not wrong
 lekin wo kisi gaiyr mard ke haathon se na pahani jaae
 Muslim women ask for bangles from the market and wear them themselves

 Delhi Labor Minister Gopal Rai said in Ahmedabad during his visit to Gujarat that the Aam Aadmi Party does not agree with what Ashutosh has written in his blog
 lihaaja ye unki nijee raay ho sakati he
 Asked by Ashutoshshani, who was isolated in the party about the statement, that Ashutosh is a spokesperson for the party, Labor Minister Gopal Rai of the Delhi government said that the party's opinion is very clear
 hamen ek saaf suthere samaaj kaa nirmaan karnaa he
 Therefore, spokesperson Ashutosh is seen to be completely isolated in the Aam Aadmi Party regarding his statement
 'hamen maryaada main rahanaa hoga'gopal raay ne kaha ki party bhi yahi sochati he ki jo saamaajik manyataayen hai, yadipartika koi sadsy unka ulanghan karegaa to uske khilaaf karrwai hogi

 Kapil Mishra had also taken Ashutosh
 Before the Hathrai, the water minister of the Kejriwal government, Kapil Mishra, also took a dig at Ashutosh's blog comparing Sandip Kumaraki Gandhiji
 mishra ne kaha tha ki tulana do baraabar waalon main ho sakati he or gandhi ji kii tulana kisi se sambhav nahin
 Gandhi's armor cannot be used for daub
 party kii vidhayak alka lamba ne bhi ashutosh ke bayaan kii ninda kii thi
 Said- BJP is different from Congress, AAP Gopal Rai also said that the Aam Aadmi Party sacked Sandeep from the government as soon as the matter came to light
 uske baad exiaar hone se pehle sandip kii party se bhi praathmik sadsyta khatm kar di, jo is baat kaa pramaan he ki party turant ection lene main yakeen rakhti he
 At the same time, there are many examples in the BJP including Vasundhara Raje, for which Parliament was stalled for several days but BJP did not take any action

 The lawyer said that a SIT inquiry should be done under the supervision of a retired judge of the Supreme Court / High Court
 police kii campus main entry roki jaani chahie
 The petitioner said that the police had to take this action to tell which such emergency situation had come
 jamiya ke procter ne kabhi police ko campus main ghusane kii ijaajat nahin di
 Police investigation should not be trusted, independent investigation should take place
 yachikakarta kii taraf se sanjay hegade ne kaha ki is maamle main swatantra jaanch kii jarurat he
 In this case an inquiry committee should be formed
 police ye bataae ki kya unako masjid, librari or toilet main ghusane ke liye kisi ne kaha tha
 Under what circumstances did these circumstances arise

 Students are scared
 yachikakarta kii taraf se indra jai singh ne kaha ki hinsa kii kisi ko ijaajat nahin di ja sakati, lekin loktantr main apni baat ko rakhana bhi sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 The whole matter is the subject of investigation

 It should be independently investigated
 yachikakarta ne kaha, police ko uniwarsity ko jaankaree deni chahie thi agar vah koi karrwai karne ja rahe the, lekin police ne aisa nahin kiya
 Indira Jaising said, due to pressure from civil society, the police released the detained students

 Will the police behave like this in the name of law and order? indira jaisingh ne yah bhi kaha ki court ke saamne 17, 18, 20, 21 saal ke chaatr hai

 That is why they are not able to present any ideal and the restlessness is increasing in public
 unhone daawa kiya ki yadi chouhan samay rahete apni karypranali main sudhaar nahin kar paye to unke mantriyon ke bhrashtachar se tang aakar janata koi nayaa vikalp chun sakati he

 They do not know that Rajasthan's traditions are different

 commahawvapurna taarikh-12 disambar There was a time when upon hearing the name of Team India, the speculative market used to do everything
 kyonki use lagata tha ki team india par daanv lagaana sabase bada jua he
 i do not know when to beat whom and whom to lose
 wo world champion ko haraakar, agle hi match main sabase phiseddi team se haar sakati thi
 In such a situation, Team India could never become a favorite of the bookies
 lekin dhoni kii aguai main team india is vakt jo qahar barapa rahi he uske baad ab vahi satta bazaar bol rahaa he vaah india!dhoni ke dhurandhar cricket ke diwaanon ke hi nahin sattebaazon ke bhi chahete ban chuke hai
 The way Team India has been going one after another, it has not only messed up the speculative market but has also changed its thinking about the Indian team completely
 jis bhartiya team par daav lagane ko satta bazaar kabhi pakistan ke baad sabase zyada jokhim bharaa kaam maanati thi usee satta bazaar ko is vakt agar kisi ek team par sabase zyada bharosa he to wo team india hi he
 According to the betting market, even if Team India is not number one in the ICC rankings, it is not only number one in the rankings of bookies but it is also the safest to claim it
 maujuuda bharat-srilanka series main lagaataar chaar van de jeet kar team india bhale hi kaiyon ko chaunkaa gai ho
 But the bookies are not surprised at this conclusion
 series shuru hone se pehle hi team india sattebaazon kii fevorett team thi or use bilukla aise hi nateezon kii ummid thi
 Before the start of the series, India's price in the speculative market was 45 paise and 70 paise of Lanka
 yani bharat kii jeet par ek lakh rupye lagane vaale ko sirf 45 hajaar kaa munafa milanaa tha jabaki lanka kii jeet par ek lakh ke daav par sidhe 70 hajaar kaa phayda tha
 It was clear from this sense of the speculative market that before the series started, India's victory was agreed and it happened just like that
 satta bazaar ke mutabik team india par daav lagane ko lekar ye badlaav siries dar siries bhartiya team kaa lagaataar behatar pradarshan he
 Be it 20-20, Team India's tour of Australia, Pakistan's tour of India, Australia's tour of India or home series against England
 har siries main bhartiya team naa sirf haaavee hokar kheli balki kai najdiki match jeet kar is dharna ko bhi galat kaabit kar diya ki team india acchhee finishr nahin he
 According to the speculative market, the current Indian team is moving ahead with great enthusiasm, confidence and courage under Dhoni's leadership in both Test and one-day
 australia, lanka or england main van-de siries jeet kar usne ye bhi dikhaa diya he ki wo sirf ghar main hi sher nahin he, or team india kii isi kamyaabi ne use satorion kaa chaheta bana diya he
 Given the tremendous performance of new players like Gautam Gambhir, Ishant Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma and Praveen Kumar, Satta Bazaar is also now assuming that the day is not far off when the Test and one-day rankings India will also be number one
 kul mila kar satta bazaar kaa philhal ek hi mantra he dhoni ke ladako par daav khelo-phaayde kii guarantee he
 Team India has undoubtedly become the favorite of the speculative market
 lekin isse khud bhartiya satta bazaar ko nuksaan bhi uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 According to the speculative market, many people are not playing the game due to the lack of Team India as a favorite
 vaise satta bazaar ko ummid he ki lanka ke khilaaf 5-0 kii jeet ko lekar bade paimaane par daav lagenge
 Team India may have improved their ranking by beating Sri Lanka in the five-match series 4–0, but this result reduced speculative market earnings
 siries iktarafa ho jane ke chalate jaise-jaise bharat kaa bhav kam se kam hota chalaa gaya vaise-vaise daav lagane vaale bhi apane haath khinchne lage
 As a result, in the first two matches of the series, the betting market had earned as much as India had been falling since the victory in the third match
 ab sarij kaa aakhri match ravivaar ko khelaa janaa he
 Since the series has been decided, the entire claim of the speculative market is now on whether India will win the series 5-0 or not
 According to the current form of the Indian team, according to the speculative market, the result is showing 5-0 and the speculative market has opened the price accordingly
 aakhri van-de main bharat kii jaat kaa bhav jahaan 35 paise he vahiin lanka kii jaat kaa bhav 1
 50 rupees
 yani bhav ke hisaab se lanka 5-0 kii haar ko taalata nahin dikh rahaa
 According to Satta Bazar, there was a lot of difference between the India and Lanka bookies on the prices of both teams before the series started
 chunki match lanka main ho rahaa tha lihaaja gharelu adwantage ko dekhte hue asia ke kai buki ne lankai jeet par bhav khole the
 Whereas the Indian speculative market opened its doors on India's victory
 alag-alag bhav khulne se zyaadaatar nuksaan satta bazaar ko hi uthaanaa padaa
 By the way, there is another problem of the speculative market
 kuch bade bookiyon kaa maananaa he ki jis tarah se har siries main ab bharat favorit mana ja rahaa he usase bharat par paise lagane waalon kii taadaad ghategi
 Because the speculators usually like to invest money on the same team, on which the profits are higher than the claims
 haalaaki satta bazaar ko ummid he ki agle maheene se shuru ho rahe newjiland daure main bharat ke bhav idha se udhar ho sakate hai
 Because the team of New Zealand is a lion in their home and the other is quite different
 iske alaava aadhe se zyada bhartiya khilaadiyon kaa ye pehla newjiland daura hoga
 That is, even though Team India is currently the most favorite team in the betting market, the real test will be in New Zealand in February

 The political situation of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is already being laid
 loksabhaa chunaav se 18 maheene pehle vampanthi dal sipiem ne congress ke saath jane or na jane ko lekar maathapai shuru kar di he
 CPM seems to be divided into two factions
 ek khemaa congress ke paksh main he to doosraa iske khilaaf
 If Sitaram Yechury is leading a pro-congress faction, then Prakash Karat Khema does not want to go with any alliance
 nai dilli main sipiem ke mukhyalay main teen dinon tak kendriya samiti kii baithak chali
 Monday was the last day of the meeting
 party ke stand main badlaav karne kii baat uthi
 At the CPM Central Committee meeting, party general secretary Sitaram Yechury made a proposal, stating that the Left parties would have to increase synergy with all secular parties to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki is prastaav main sidhe-sidhe congress kaa ullekh nahin he, lekin yechuri ke kareebi sutron ke anusaar yechuri agle loksabhaa chunaav main congress samet tamaam dharmanirpeksh partiyon ke saath vaicharik or chunavi samjhauta kar siyaasi maidan main utarana chaahate hai
 On the other hand, Prakash Karat put forward a second proposal in the Central Committee meeting, in which the Left parties have been asked not to align with any party
 is prastaav par 63 sadasyon ne apni baat rakhi jisamen 32 sadasyon ne prakaash karaat kii line kaa samarthan kiya to vahiin 31 sadsy yechuri se sahamat najar aae
 That is, there is a close competition between the two groups
 haalanki yechuri or karaat donon narendra modi ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf hai
 Both leftist leaders want that steps should be taken to oust Kimodi from power in 2019
 lekin ye kaise ho ise lekar donon main matbhed hai
 Let me tell you that within three years, the HCPM is preparing to move away from its old stand and go back to the secular parties, including the Congress
 teen saal pehle vishakhapattanam main hui party congress main yah prastaav paas hua tha ki vampanthi dal na to bijepi or na hi congress ke saath kisi tarah kaa talmail yaa gathbandhan karenge
 Despite this, a large section of the CPM for 2019 is thinking of an alliance with the Congress

 It did start a little late, but it became memorable
 duusare khelon ke vipareet cricket main koi antarrashtriya toornament nahin tha
 And when it started, male players were excluded from it, because the first World Cup of cricket was for women players
 purushon ke khel main paison kii kami thi
 The reason was that the number of spectators in first-class matches in England, which played a major role in money matters, was declining rapidly and many counties were in debt
 phir, jin test maichon main england nahin hota tha, unamem darshakon kii sankhya ghatati ja rahi thi
 Clearly, some steps needed to be taken to arouse interest in the audience
 lekin koi antarrashtriya test championships karai jaati to isamen paison or intjamaat kii badi samasya aati
 No one was ready to bear the burden of this
 us samay test cricket hi ekmaatr sthapit formet tha
 Yes, the English county teams were playing 40 and 60 overs
 lekin 1975 ke vishwa cap se pehle sabhi antarrashtriya timen sirf 20 over ke match khel chuki thim
 So the ODI was a new thing for most of the players
 england se baahar ke darshakon ke liye bhi yah bilkul nayaa formet tha
 The West Indies team was getting ready in 1975
 rohan kanhai saal bhar pehle captaini chhod chuke the or mujhe captaini kaa bhaar saunpa gaya tha
 At that time, i was 30 years old and our team was looking for a balanced team with a combination of young and experienced players
 haalanki hamaari tej gendbaajon kii aakraamak chaukadi abhi bhavishya kii baat thi
 We had some all-rounder players and some of the best fielders such as Vivian Richards, Gorden Greenidge and Roy Fredericks
 hamaare paksh main ek baat yah bhi thi ki hamaare kuch khilaadiyon main county cricket khilne kaa anubhav tha, jaise asex ke liye khel chuke kith boes yaa varvikshire ke liye khel chuke derick moore
 The West Indies and Australia were then considered the main contenders
 final main ham donon kaa muqabla hua
 We were thrilled and wanted to win
 vah vishleshkon, ranneetikaron or manovaigyanikon kaa jamaana nahin tha
 We had to gather all the morale from within
 1974 main paanch test maichon ke bharat daure ke samay maine ranneeti or vishleshan kii buniyadi baaten seekhni shuru kar di thim
 We knew how to play in a 60-over match
 un dinon chunki fielding ke niyam alag the, jisamen pehle ke 15 overon main koi bhitari gheraa nahin hota tha, isliye hamen acchhee tarah pataa hota tha ki kitne ranon kaa lakshya sahi rahegaa
 Yet we did not underestimate our opposing teams
 australia ke chapel bandhuon, denis lily or jeff thomson or pakistan ke jahir abbaas va asif ikbaal ko england main khilne kaa khaasaa anubhav tha
 The Pakistan team brought with them an 18-year-old boy, Javed Miandad, who looked very talented
 hamaare group main chauthi team srilanka thi
 He was probably the only team not yet established
 lekin ve utane nausikhie bhi nahin the, jitna purvi africa kii team
 Most matches were very tough matches
 west indies ke liye sabase bada mode tab aayaa jab hamane birmingham main pakistan ke khilaaf sirf do gend baaki rahete ek wicket se jeet hasil kii
 It was a match that took a hard test of our bowlers Andy Roberts, Keith Boes, Bernard Julian and Vanborn Holder
 mahatvapurn baat he ki final se ek haftaa pehle ham ovel main australia ke khilaaf khel chuke the or 14 over shesh rahete hamane saat wicket se jeet hasil kii thi
 Alvin Kalicharan's counter-attack against the sharp bowler Lily in that match was a special contribution
 final to kai kaarnon se yaadgaar rahaa
 It was very special for me as i scored 102 off 85 balls
 vah match isliye bhi yaad he ki ross edwards ne midwicket par meraa kaich chhod diya tha
 At that time i was playing for 26 runs
 uske baad maine koi galati nahin kii
 i will be grateful to Rohan who continues to support me from the other end
 hamaari pari santoshjanak rahi, kyonki jab main rohan ke saath khilne aayaa to us vakt musiibat main dikh rahe the or 291 ranon kaa hamaara score us samay pahaad-sa lag rahaa tha
 More importantly, that victory gave the title of World Champion to a small country with a population of 50 lakhs organized just because of cricket
 ham gaurav ke liye khele or vijayi rahe
 Our salary did not increase much but that strength put our cricket board in a strong position against other boards
