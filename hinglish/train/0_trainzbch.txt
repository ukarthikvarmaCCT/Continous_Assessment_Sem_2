 Contribution to GDP Economic Survey 2018-19, released on July 4, 2019, states that "about 93 percent" of the total workforce is unorganized

 What is the source of these information? Economic survey 2018-19 does not know the answer to this question
 niti ayog 2014 kii ek report 'oisidi india policy brif: ajukeshan and skill' kaa hawala detaa he jo khud apane soochna strot ke bare main maun he
 Another report of the government is' Report of the Committee on Organized Sector Statistics', a 2012 report by the National Statistical Commission which states that 'more than 90 percent of the total workforce in the country' is unorganized '
 yahaan bhi soochna strot kaa koi zikr nahin he
 The government believes that the disorganized sector and workers contribute significantly to the economy
 rashtriya sankhyikee ayog kii 2012 kii report kahati he ki 'rashtriya utpaadan main is kshetra kaa yogadan 50 pratishat he
 "but this report does not explain how it came to conclusion? This report then explains the problem in detail:" There is a lack of reliable data about the contribution, distribution and size of the unorganized sector
 isliye bhartiya arthvyavastha main is kshetra ke mahatv ke bare main na to vaastavik samajhadaari ban paati he or na hi vikaas yojanaon main isapar koi vichaar hota he
 “working conditions and benefits The unorganized sector is deprived of legal protection
 isamen kaam karne vaale logon kii paristhitiyaan or saamaajik suraksha bahut kharaab he
 The Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS) 2017-18 was released in May 2019, where this problem is reflected
 yah survey kahata he ki asangathit kshetra main niyamit vetan par kaam karne vaale 71
 1% have no job contract, 54
 2% ko ped live nahin milti or 49
 6% do not get any kind of social security benefits
 kul milakar asangathit kshetra kii tasviir kaaphi niraashajanak he
 a 2015 report by the Ministry of Labor and Employment states that 82% of unorganized workers in agriculture and non-agricultural sectors have no contract, 77
 3% ko ped live nahin milti or 69% ko kisi bhi tarah kii saamaajik suraksha kaa laabh nahin miltaa
 If we talk about salary, then the situation is no different
 nunatam vetan act 1948 desh ke zyaadaatar hisson main prabhavi dhang se lagu nahin he
 The Economic Survey 2018-19 states that not all salaried workers fall within the purview of the law and that "one in three salaried workers in India are denied legal protection
" ”bhartiya majdoor sangh (BMS) ke sike sajinarayan is vishay par kehete hai ki yah sharmnaak he
 He says, "they don't get holidays, don't get security resources, don't get medical facilities, don't get any help for family welfare
" iske alaava unke kaam ke ghanton kii koi seemaa nahin he
 Their salaries are very low
 yahaan tak ki anorgenised workars soshal security act 2008 aane ke baad bhi bamushkil 5-6 pratishat kaa hi naam saamaajik suraksha labhaarthi ke rup main darj ho sakaa”
 All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) general secretary Amarjit Kaur says this is because unorganized workers have not received any legal protection and governments have always ignored their interests
 haalanki, udyog jagat ke log is bare main alag raay rakhte hai
 Ms Unnikrishnan, chairman of the CII National Committee on Industrial Relations, says that it is not the case that unorganized workers are exploited in all parts of the country, but it is hoped that if the government is introducing a new labor code, it will help prevent exploitation
 chunautiyaan or aage kii raaysan gathit kshetra kii chunautiyaan apaar hai
 Professor Satyaki Roy of the Institute for Studies in Industrial Development (ISID), which is also the think tank of the Indian Council of Social Sciences Research (ICSSR), says that the new provisions from the government and more from the scope of worker safety laws Will be out ve kehete hai ki haal main agar sangathit kshetron main utpaadan badha he to isliye kyonki is kshetra main anubandh karmiyon kii sankhya main ijapha hua he
 Therefore, if the government opens the way, then the number of workers who have no legal protection will increase
 bhartiya majdoor sangh ke mutabik, teen pramukh chunautiyaan hai
 The most difficult task is to identify the unorganized workers, provide adequate funds and adequate mechanisms for their social security and implement this new labor code to the villages
 haalanki, unhen is bare main pragati kaa bharosa he kyonki sarkaar ne asangathit kamgaaron ke liye ayushmaan bharat or pension yojana kii manshaa jataai he
 On the question of dealing with the challenges of low wages, Unnikrishnan says that my advice is that the labor unions should take care of this and organize the workers to ensure that they get adequate wages, social security and other benefits
 BMS or AITUC donon hi sanghathanon kaa kahana he ki unhone kaaphi mushkilon ke baavjood asangathit kshetra main pehle hi kaam shuru kar diya he
 These workers are not only scattered, but their migration also hinders their organization
 asal sawaal yah he ki sarkaar in samasyaon or chunautiyon se nipatane main kaise kaamyaab ho paaegi? Two days after the DMK withdrew support to the UPA government, the CBI today raided 19 locations, including the residence of MK Stalin, son of party chief m Karunanidhi

 While the Congress is scrambling to return to power, the BJP is determined to retain its power
 donon partiyon kii najar rajya ke patel voton par he
 While Rahul Gandhi made efforts to connect the Patel community through Saurashtra, BJP president Amit Shah has also been making every effort to woo his traditional votes (patel)
 gujarat ke kingmekargujrat main patidaar matadaata kareeb 20 fisadi hai
 In the current government, about 40 mlas and 7 ministers are from the Patel community
 patidaar samaaj bijepika paramparaagat voter rahaa he
 The bjp's hold on the Patidars has weakened since Narendra Modi became the country's PM from Gujarat's CM in 2014
 hardik patel ke netritv main shuru hue patel andolan ne bijepi kii pakad ko or kamjor kar diya he
 Hardik Patel has been making every effort to create a continuous atmosphere against the BJP and in the past, he had also taken out the Sankalp Yatra
 2012 main patelon kii pehali pasand bijepigujrat main patelon main do up-samudaay hai
 One of them Leuva Patel and the other is Kadva Patel
 hardik, kadava patel hai
 Keshubhai Patel hails from Leuva community
 1990 ke dashak se hi do-tihaai se zyada patel, bijepi ke paksh main vot karte aae hai
 The Leuva's share in the Patidar community is 60 per cent and that of Kadva is 40 per cent
 congress ko kadava ke mukaable leuva se zyada samarthan miltaa rahaa he
 The Patidar community organizes and votes

 Amit Shah has conceded the Gujarat elections
 patelon ko saadhane ke liye bijepi ne sardaar patel ke gaanv karamsad se 'mishan gujarat' kaa aagaaj kiya
 On Sunday, Gaurav Yatra took place under the leadership of Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel, which was flagged off by Amit Shah
 leuva patel ko saadhenge jitu waghanigujrat gaurav yatra kaa doosraa charan bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh jitu waghani kii aguwai main aaj porbandar se shuru ho rahaa he
 Jeetu Vaghani is Leuva Patel
 is tarah shah donon patel netaaon ko puure gujarat ke daure par bhejkar patidaar samudaay ko saadhane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The 149 Vidhan Sabha through Gaurav Yatra, led by Nazrnitin Patel and Jeetu Vaghani, will cover more than 4700 km and will pass through 149 rural seats in a total of 182 assembly constituencies of the state
 iskaa samaapan 16 oktober ko hoga or piem narendra modi sabha ko sambodhit karenge
 With the help of Sardar Patel, BJPBJP President Shah took recourse to Sardar Patel to surround the Congress
 unhone kaha ki congress ne sardaar patel ko der se kyon diya bharat ratna ? shah ne narmada baandh ke mudde par bhi congress ko gheraa or kaha, congress ne kyon roka tha baandh kaa kaam?patelon par gujarat sarkaar meharbanvijay rupani ke netritv vaali gujarat kii bijepi sarkaar ne patel samudaay ke aarakshan ke liye ayog ko manjuuri di he
 Apart from this, the government is considering to withdraw the Patel community of people who had filed a case due to the agitation
 bijepi sarkaar ne patidaar samudaay ke pratinidhiyon se baatcheet kii or patidaaron ko khush karne ke liye kai kadamon kaa elaan kiya he
 Rahul's eye on the Patel Congress is also engaged in the exercise of connecting the Patels
 pichley dinon congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne gujarat main apana chunavi aagaaj patelon ke durg saurashtra se kiya
 Rahul did all the exercises to win the hearts of the Patels
 rahul ne patel samudaay ko sambodhit karne se lekar unke aatmgaurav maane jane vaale bodaladham mandir tak main maathaa teka
 bjp's equation is BJP has been in power for the last two decades
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi sarkaar ke khilaaf antiikambency kaa bhi maahaul he
 In such a situation, the Congress is also expected to return to power
 1985 main congress kaa vot 55
 6 percent which fell to 38 in 2012
 9 fisadi rah gaya
 In the same period, the bjp's graph rose from 15 per cent to 48 per cent
 pichley teen chunaavon main bijepi ke liye, ye 48-50 fisadi ke bich rahaa he
 Congress too 30 in 1990
 7 fisadi se apana pradarshan sudhaarte hue 2012 main ise 39 fisadi tak pahunchaaya
 On an average there has been a difference of 10 per cent votes between the BJP and the Congress

 Preparations for the sacrifice have begun
 muslim samaaj ke log bakreed ke maukey par namaaj padhane ke saath bakron yaa duusare maweshiyon kii qurbaani dete hai
 But, this time there is a suspicion among the Muslim society about the sacrifice
 khaskar upi ko lekar sthiti spasht najar nahin aa rahi he
 Recently the All India Muslim majlis-mushawarat (AIMMM) met in which appealed the Muslims not to sacrifice the bovine on the occasion of Bakrid
 magar meeting main goraksha ke naam par saamne ai hinsak ghatnaon par bhi chintaa jaahir kii gai
 AIMMM general secretary Maulana Abdul Hameed Nomani said that this time among Muslims, there is a fear of sacrificing Bakrid
 unke mutabik, khaskar upi ko lekar halaat kaaphi najuk najar aa rahe hai
 Maulana Nomani has demanded the central and all state governments to clarify the situation regarding the sacrifice
 saath hi is dharmik adhikaar ko bina bhay ke istemaal karne kii sthiti sunishchit karne bhi apil kii
 On the other hand, Jamiat Ulema-e Hind has also issued an appeal in relation to Bakrid for Muslims
 jamiyat ne musalamaanon se safed maveshi yani govansh kii qurbaani na karne kii guzarish kii he
 The appeal reads, "if the miscreants prevent black animals from sacrificing somewhere else, the administration should be sacrificed by some sensible and ignorant people with confidence
 ''jamiyat ulema-e hind ke adhyaksh moulana arshad madani ne ajtak se bataaya ki unhone musalamaanon se govansh kii qurbaani na dene kii apil kii he
 Especially ignoring the atmosphere of fear in UP, he said, "administration is with us
 hamane logon se kaha he ki agar qurbaani main koi aadchan paidaa karata he to prashasan ke paas jaaen or unki madad se qurbaani karen
 Maulana Arshad Madni, however, brushed aside any fear of the Yogi government in UP
 magar unhone musalamaanon se ye jarur kaha ki jahaan pehle se qurbaani hoti ai hai, vahaan har haal main qurbaani karen
 Let me tell you that illegal slaughterhouses were closed after the Yogi government came in UP

 The young man is in critical condition and is undergoing treatment at bhu's Trauma Center
 peedit naaballig yuvak kaa daawa he ki jai shri ram na bolne kii sajaa use di gai he
 However, police say that the victim's minor youth is repeatedly changing the statement
 ajtak se baatcheet main chandauli ke espi santosh kumaar singh ne kaha ki peedit ne sabase pehle bataaya ki wo maharaajapur gaanv kii ore daudane gaya tha jahaan use chaar ladke mili, ye chaaron ladke use khinch kar khet kii ore le gaye or mitti kaa tel daalkar aag laga di
 The victim's minor youth said on camera that he had gone for a walk on the Dudhari bridge where four people kidnapped him and burned him
 peedit kaa kahana he ki aropiyon ke munh bandhe hue the, usame se ek ne kaha ki is par mitti kaa tel chhidak do or maachis maar do
 It will die on its own
 iske baad mitti kaa tel chhidakkar maachis markar wo bhaag gayi
 The victim's minor youth said, "those people were saying Jai Shri Ram
 
 
 ham nahin bole
 
 
 Those people started killing
 
 
 "espi santosh kumaar singh ne ajtak se kaha ki jab peedit naaballig yuvak se jila aspataal main unhone baat kii to bataaya ki sunil naam kaa yuvak ghatana main shaamil tha, peedit ne ghatnasthal chhatel gaanv bataaya
 Chhatel village is about 2 kilometers from Manrajpur village

 According to the police, this village is in a completely different direction
 police ne daawa kiya he ki in teen lokation kii jaankaree milane ke baad jab unhone in teenon lokation par lage sisitivi camere ke footage dekhe to naaballig yuvak usamen nahin dikhaa
 SP says that till three o'clock there was no such thing as Jai Shri Ram in this incident
 espi kaa daawa he ki kuch logon ne peedit or uski maa ko bargala diya ki agar is ghatana ko jai shri ram ke naare se joda jaae to ye bada maamla ban jayega or use aarthik madad milegaa
 After this, these people diverted the entire stance

 On the first date of January, where the entire country was celebrating the new year, a different backdrop was being prepared in Maharashtra
 pune ke koregaanv bhima main 'shaury diwas' ke salanaa aayojan main shaamil hone ja rahe daliton par achaanak kathith taur par hamalaa kiya gaya
 Along with this, Koregaon Bhima came into the limelight and a series of protests started against this attack across the country
 1 janvari ko har saal hajaaron dalit koregaanv bhima main bane smarak par 1818 main peshwa bajirao dwitiya kii sena par angreji fouj ke dalit sainikon kii jeet ko apane gauravshaalee ateet kii yaad ke taur par manaane jutate hai (dekhen box)
 Rahul Sonpimple, a resident of Nagpur, Maharashtra and a research student at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, explains, "in fact, as a struggle of their ancestors against social evils, Dalits remember how they fought against the inhuman Peshwa Raj Had fought ''lekin is baar aisa kya hua ki is aayojan ne hi sangharsh kaa rup le liya? ek bade police afasar kaa kahana he ki yah takaraav pehle se taiyaar script kaa hissaa najar aata he
 Actually, there are two major places within the four km radius of Koregaon Bhima - Tulapur and Vadhu
 tulapur vah jagah he jahaan mughal badshaah aurangzeb ne maratha naresh sambhaji ko nau dinon tak amanviya yatnaaen dekar maar daalaa tha
 Dalits believe that Ganpat Gaekwad, a member of his community, collected the corpses of Chhatrapati Sambhaji and cremated him with full respect
 2013 me kuch sthaneey logon ne maratha naresh kii garima kii raksha ke liye ganpat gaekwad ke sammaan main vadhu main gaekwad kii samadhi kaa nirmaan karvaa diya tha
 The trouble started when some anti-social elements broke the roof of the Samadhi of the bridegroom, Gaikwad on 30 December 2017
 uske baad soshal media par sandesh viral kiye jane lage ki samadhi ko nuksaan pahunchane ke liye kade atyaachaar kanoon ke tahat saat maratha yuvaaon ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 On January 1, when Bhima Koregaon, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the battle, a record 3 so far for the annual event
 5 lakh dalit ikattha hue, tab kuch asamaajik tatwon ne unke vaahanon main tod-phod kii, auraton par hamale kiye or 150 ke aasapaas vaahanon main aag laga di
 Shortly thereafter, a Maratha youth, Rahul Phatangade was beaten to death by unknown people at a nearby place called Sunswadi
 natijatan daliton or maraathon ke bich tanaav bad gaya
 On 2nd and 3rd of January, when Dalits staged protests across Maharashtra and set fire to government buses and dispersed traffic, they not only expressed outrage against the attack on members of their community But were also pointing towards caste polarization in the state
 daliton ke man main jahaan darkinar kiye jane kii bhaavana ghar karti ja rahi he, vahiin siyaasi morche par bhi unhone rajya main khud ko alag-thalag paaya he
 Political experts believe that this case is just the beginning of expressing long-standing anger in the minds of Dalits
 kareeb dedh saal pehle maraathon ne rajya bhar main aakraamak dhang se 57 vishaal reliyaan nikaalkar ahmednagar ke koprdi main ek maratha kishori ke saath balaatkaar karne vaale teen dalit yuvaaon ko faansee par chadhaane or samudaay ko talim ke saath-saath sarkari naukariyon main aarakshan dene kii maang par jor diya tha
 Even at that time there was discontent among the Dalits
 koprdi ke maamle main vishesh adaalat ne 29 november ko mujarimon ko maut kii sajaa sunai thi
 On the other hand, another court acquitted eight Maratha youths accused of further killing a Dalit youth, Nitin
 aage ko kathith taur par ek maratha ladki ke saath prem sambandh rakhane kii vajah se maar daalaa gaya tha
 Dalits across the state had expressed their displeasure against the court's decision
 ve chaahate hai ki sarkaar nichali adaalat ke faisle ko chunauti de, jise sarkaar ne maan liya he, par abhi tak koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya he
 According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the conviction rate against Dalits in the state is only 10
 5 fisadi he

 "the latest protests are a mixed effect of suppressed emotions," says Pawar
 daliton ko kharalanji kii ghatana ke baad se hi nazarandaaj kiya ja rahaa he
 The latest protests have revived him
 ''haalanki bharip bahujan mahasang (bibiem) ke netaa prakaash ambedkar kahana he ki is ghatana ko jaateey drushtikon se nahin dekha janaa chahie
 They blame the alleged Hindutva organizations for this
 unhone is ghatana ke peeche shiv pratishthan ke sansthaapak manohar urf sambhaji bhide or hindu ekta aghadi ke pramukh milind ekbote kaa haath hone kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Sonpimple also does not consider the Bhima Koregaon incident as Maratha versus Dalit
 ve kehete hai, ''yah ghatana agar maratha banaam dalit hota to ab tak rajya bhar main dange ho jate kyonki maratha vahaan bada samudaay he
 Here some Maratha organizations are with Dalits on this issue
 '' isse pehle rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) ke adhyaksh or maharashtra ke purv mukhyamantri sharad pavaar ne bhi kaha ki is hamale ke peeche hindutvvaadi sanghathanon kaa haath he
 Sharad Pawar and the Congress have blamed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the BJP for this
 haalanki mukhyamantri devendra fadavis ne logon se apil kii ki kuch log rajya main jaateey tanaav nirmit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, vahiin maharashtra main aresas ke sabhi chaar praant sanghachaalkon ne ek sanyukt bayaan jari karke samaaj se saamaajik sauhaard banaae rakhane kii apil kii or un logon ke prachaar ke bahaakaave main nahin aane ke liye kaha ''jo samaaj main foot daalane ko amada'' hai
 The Dalits of Maharashtra have historically not been united on social and political fronts
 rajya main unki khaasi badi 12 fisadi aabaadi he
 He dominates 46 assembly constituencies and 10 Lok Sabha constituencies, but he never stood behind any political party
 daliton main bhi zyada bada hissaa maharon kaa he or unke baad chamaar, maatang, dhor or vadar aate hai
 However, there is no conflict between the different factions within the Dalits
 zyaadaatar maharon ne buddha dharm apana liya he or ve siyaasi morchon par bante hue hai
 The Congress always encouraged Mathang leaders more than the Mahars and thus forced the Mahars to explore other options
 jamini hakeekat pichley dashak se badalati aa rahi he
 Initially, the Dalits had a vibe towards the Shiv Sena and they used to like it very much
 beete do-ek saal main daliton ke kuch hisson ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguwai vaali bhaajapa ke prati rukh kiya
 The central government's plan to buy goods from Dalit entrepreneurs on a priority basis and the state government's plan to reserve 20 per cent industrial land for Dalits drew the community towards the BJP
 nateeja yah hua ki maratha jab aarakshan kii maang ko lekar vishaal reliyaan nikaal rahe the, dalit majbootee se bhaajapa ke peeche khadey the or unhone nagar nikaayon ke saath gram panchayaton ke chunaavon main number ek party ke taur par ubharne main bhaajapa kii madad kii thi
 Dalits and other backward classes (obcs) have helped the Mahdud BJP to spread its wings in the rural areas in the last two years till the urban areas
 siyaasi jaankaar maanate hai ki ensipi ke adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne daliton kaa mizaaj zyada chaturaai se bhaanp liya tha
 They were looking for an opportunity to stop him from getting close to the BJP
 koregaanv bhima kii ghatana ne unhen jaruri asalha muhaiyaa kara diya
 Therefore, he immediately declared that Hindutva forces are behind the attack on Dalits in Koregaon Bhima
 is tarah unhone ek hi pathar se do shikaar kiye
 He tried to put the responsibility of the attacks on the RSS and made sure that the outrage of the Dalits should shift from the Marathas to the BJP
 is uthalputhal se bhari siyaasi haalat se bedaag batch nikalne kii bhaajapa kii ummiden rajya ke dalit netaa or kendriya saamaajik nyaay rajyamantri ramdaas athavle ke samarthan par tiki hai, jinaki bhartiya republican party endie main shaamil he
 This also shows the bjp's failure to get a Dalit face in the state
 party ne chaar pramukh daliton—patrkaar sunil gaekwad or amar saabale, filmkaar sharad bansode or arthshaastri narendra jadhav—ko jarur aage badhaayaa, par unamem se koi bhi party ke dalit chehre ke taur par ubharne main naakaam rahaa
 Chief Minister Fadnavis had managed to overcome his displeasure by raising Dalits and obcs against the Marathas
 ab jab dalit tod-phod par utaaru hai, fadavis kii siyaasi pantarebaaji kii ek baar phir agnipariksha hogi
 This entire officer has strengthened Prakash Ambedkar
 ve samudaay kii hamadardi hasil karne main kaamyaab rahe
 Earlier, a large section of Dalits have been united behind Athawale
 haalanki ambedkar yah bhi maanate hai ki daliton or maraathon ke bich khai aane vaale dinon main or chaudee ho sakati he
 However, Ambedkar is accustomed to losing his credibility by joining hands with 'wrong' people
 gujarat ke vidhayak jignesh mewaani or jawaharal laal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr netaa umr khalid ko saath lekar bhaajapa-virdohi morcha banane kii unki manshaa kaa samudaay ke logon main acha asar nahin hua he
 Leading social activist Sunil Khobragade says, "if external leaders are imposed on us, we will not tolerate it
" ''udhar, bhaajapa ke liye mushkil yah he ki rashtriya str par bhi daliton ke khilaaf ghatnaon ne sarkaar ke khilaaf daliton ko naaraaz kiya he
 In the recently concluded Gujarat Assembly elections, the issue of atrocities on Dalits has been arising since the Una incident and anti-bjp faces like Mevani have emerged
 isse pehle hyderabad vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr rohit vemula or uttar pradesh ke saharanpur main daliton par hamale tathaa bhim army ke chandrashekhar ke masale par bhi centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar ko daliton kii ore se baari virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa he

 kendriya grahamantri pi chidambaram ne kaha he ki batla house muthbhed farji nahin thi or uski dubaara jaanch kaa sawaal hi nahin he
 He said that whatever thoughts the party leader Digvijay Singh had on this are his personal views
 gauratlab he ki digvijay singh samay-samay par se batla house muthbhed ko farji qaraar dete rahe hai or isaki dubaara jaanch kii maang karte rahe hai
 After the meeting of the Group of Ministers on the media, Chidambaram told reporters, "the Batla House encounter was correct, and there is no possibility of reopening the case
" ' gyaat ho ki congress ke mahasachiv digvijay singh ne ek din pehle kaha ki batla house muthbhed farji ho saktaa he
 After his comment, Chidambaram gave this statement
 ullekhneey he ki 19 sitambar 2008 ko dilli ke okhla ilaake main sthit batla house main police ke saath hui muthbhed main do sandigdh aatankwaadi maare gaye the
 Both suspected terrorists were residents of Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh

 sharma shahid ho gaye
 Chidambaram said that Singh has his own personal opinion on the matter while his opinion is different
 buudhvaar ko bhi digvijay singh ne ek baar phir se is ghatana ko uthaate hue ise ‘farji’ bataaya tha
 He had said that he has always considered the Batla House encounter to be fake and tried to get the government and the home ministry to investigate the matter but could not succeed in it
 singh ne azamgarh main kaha tha, ‘pradhanmantri or grih mantralay kii raay thi ki muthbhed vaastavik thi
 So i did not put pressure on it later
 ’udhar bijepi ne bhi is maamle main sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi par nishaanaa saadhaa he

 usne kaha ki ek ore grih mantri pi chidambaram use sahi muthbhed bataa rahe hai to congress netaa digvijay singh ise farji kah rahe hai
 BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said here, "if Chidambaram as Home Minister is calling the Batla House encounter a real encounter, then why is Digvijay calling it a fake encounter in Azamgarh in the presence of Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi
" unhone kaha ki aise main log kiski baat par yakeen karen
 Prasad said that whether Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi will open their mouths to clarify the matter or whether they will keep silence about this for vote bank politics

 apni eemaandaaree ke liye jane-jane vaale haryana ke tej taraar adhikari ashok khemka ek baar phir surkhiyon main he
 This time he has opened a front against Haryana Minister Krishna Kumar Bedi
 ek jeep ke durupyog ko lekar khemka or rajya ke saamaajik nyaay evam mahila shashaktikaran mantri krishna kumaar bedi ke bich main than gai he
 Khemka alleges that Minister Krishna Kumar Bedi not only misused his own department's jeep throughout the year but also did not consider it appropriate to take any approval for it

 Bedi continued to misuse this jeep for more than a year
 dilachasp baat yah he ki yah jeep jis adhikari ko sarkari kaamkaaj ke liye di gai thi, vah paidal hi daura karke apane kaamkaaj nipataate rahe
 Not only this, the minister did not consider it right to return the jeep even after repeated demands
 lihaaja majaboor hokar ashok khemka ko unke khilaaf morcha kholana padaa
 Krishna Jeep Bedi had asked for this jeep on 29 September 2016
 jab jila adhikariyon ke kehane par mantri ne jeep nahin lautaai, to maamle ko sambandhit vibhaag ke principal secretary ashok khemka ke samaksh bheja gaya
 Angered by the misuse of the official jeep, Ashok Khemka not only asked the minister to return the jeep, but also cited the two cars which have been given to him by the government
 khemka ne mantri ko eemaandaaree kaa paath padhaane ke liye baqayada yah bhi likhaa ki balavaan ko hameshaa kamjor kii raksha kerani chahie or charitra kii shakti kanoon kaa paalan karne main hoti he, na ki use todane main
 Khemkane also reminded the minister that he had taken a vow at the time of his admission to the public service that he would remain faithful to the Constitution and would perform his responsibilities without any fear
 udhar, ashok khemka kaa khat milane ke baad se mantri apana munh chipa phir rahe hai
 Also claimed that they have returned the departmental vehicle on Thursday itself
 haalanki itani safai ke baad khemka chup nahin baithe or ek saal tak vibhaag kii jeep kaa durupyog karne vaale mantri ko saaf taur par kah diya ki jeep ko vibhaag ko lautaane se pehle salbhar uske istemaal main jo kharch aayaa, uski manjuuri bhi le len
 Now it is to be seen what effect this letter of Ashok Khemka has on the BJP government of Haryana? It is known that till now Ashok Khemka has been taking action against him on all the cases related to irregularities
 khemka pradeep kaasni ke baad haryana ke duusare bade iees adhikari hai, jinka sabase zyada baar tabadalaa kiya gaya

 england ke ballebaaj ian bel ne kaha ki bharat ke khilaaf duusare test ke tisare din chaay kaa brake samajhakar unka krij se laut janaa naadaani bharaa kadam tha
 Bell played a brilliant innings of 159 runs but his century did not become a matter of discussion in the run-out drama yesterday
 unhone kaha, yah meri naadaani thi ki maine samajha ki gend dead (khel main nahin he) ho gai he or main chaaykaal samajhakar baahar chalaa gaya, yah bevakoofana tha
 Bell was controversially run out when he left the crease after taking a run because he felt the ball was dead and it was time for tea
 is ballebaaj ko haalanki bhartiya team ne waapas khilne ke liye bula liya
 India withdrew its appeal, introducing sportsmanship
 england ke ballebaaj ne kaha, morgan (eon) ne seemaa rekha kii taraf shot lagaaya or kshetrarakshak ne dive kiya, aisa lag rahaa tha ki yah chauke ke liye chali gai he, kshetrarakshakon ke vyavhaar se bhi yahi lag rahaa tha
 i took the third run and looked back, it seemed the same from the umpire Asad Rauf (who was about to give the bowler his goods)
 bel ne kaha, meri shuruuaati pratikriya naadaani bhari thi or main chaay ke liye baahar chalaa gaya
 i went towards Morgan
 main ran lene kaa prayaas nahin kar rahaa tha
 Then we went to the borderline, then we realized that something had changed
 unhone kaha, hamen laga ki kuch ho rahaa he
 But we did not feel that we are involved in this
 ham yah samajhane kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 When i was given out, i was shocked
 unhone saath hi khulaasa kiya ki unhen bilkul ant main bataaya gaya ki vah pari jari rakh sakate hai
 Bell said, i was told at the very last minute
 praayar ne pad baandh liye the
 There was a knock at the door that i can go and bat
 captainon or kochon kii baatcheet ke baad ant main hamen bataaya gaya
 Bell said he took a lesson from yesterday's incident
 unhone kaha, maine bahut badi sikh lee he
 In the end both teams made the right decision
 unhone (bharat ne) jis tarah se halaaton ko sambhala, vah shandaar tha
 This was not a deliberate mistake
 is par faisla kiya gaya

 Sibal has proposed a bill, which will have a provision to ban those accused of heinous crimes so that criminals can be kept away from politics
 unhone kaha ki unhone is vishay par vidhi ayog se raay maangi he
 Sibal said, 'I have written to the Law Commission
 maine unki raay maangi he, lekin nijee rup se, maine vidheyak ke masaude par kaam bhi kiya he
 'sibal said that he believes' privately' that those accused of heinous crimes like murder, kidnapping, rape with a sentence of at least seven years should not be allowed to contest elections
 unhone kaha, 'agar ve doshi nahin hai, agar ve sirf aaropee hai, unhen phir bhi chunaav ladane kii anumati nahin honi chahie

 He was asked whether he was on the lines of the July 10 judgment of the Supreme Court in which jailed people were prevented from contesting elections and the disqualified public representatives were immediately disqualified
 is sawaal ke jawaab main sibbal ne kaha, ‘‘main jo bahes chal rahi he usase das kadam aage ja rahaa hum
 'the special thing is that during the monsoon session, the Parliament had nullified the order of the Supreme Court to prevent the jailed people from contesting elections

 David Abraham of Delhi, Abraham and Thakore, says that he remembers his Syrian Christian grandmother wearing a colorful Kanjeevaram saree instead of her white Chatta Munda on special occasions
 Remember what she used to wear, the design of the saree had a border
 '' pahchaan kaa hi sawaal tha jisane unhen sari ke saath prayog karne ke liye uksaaya—kaato, style do, nayaa rup hasil karo
 Abraham & Thakore designed both stitched and stitched forms without a sari
 unke liye yah lanbaa achoota kapadaa kisi ilaakai tahjeeb kaa bhi aainaa ban saktaa he, kisi daftar kii vardi bhi, yahaan tak ki kisi uttejk stri kaa pratik bhi
 As the fashion week continues to enter another spring-summer cycle, it is expected that many of the unconventional saris worn will be on the ramp
 sari ko nai chaahaton ke pahanaave ke rup main nayaa jivan dene kii koshishon main nostalgia kii takat ko nazarandaaj kiya gaya he
 Such a past in the future has caught the attention of many designers
 unhone sari, uski style or yahaan tak ki blouse ke saath bhi prayog kiye hai
 The blouse has equal importance and is a style statement in itself that can also serve as a game-changer for a sari — as a bomber jacket or as a cape or cropped shirt
 sari kii antarrashtriya misaalen bhi hai
 Japanese composer Yoshiki is considered the head and co-founder of the heavy metal music group x Japan worldwide
 yoshiki ne 2015 main apane kimono brands yoshicomono kii sthapana kii
 Her first collection had a range of 'rock star kimono', with non-traditional prints and an unusual OB belt in a body-studded kimono, and a length of mini-skirt that was worn with a high heel
 If she wanted to go, then she had a leather collar to wear with a high heeled boot
 lagata he, kabhi bhi sthapit style par na chalane vaali bhartiya sari bhi isi tarah ke badlaavon kaa anusaran kar rahi he
 In Rita Kapoor Chishti's 2010 book Sarees of India — Tradition and Beyond, it was called Draupadi's 'endless Clothes of Time'
 is vastra ne ramp par jaise ek vaapasi kii he
 She is coping with new designs and fashion in a very simple way, designers are keeping memories of the past in sync with future designs
 japan main jaise yohji yamamato or ri kavakubo sareekhe diggajon ke jariye kimono ko nayaa jivan mila, jinhone pashchimi fishan ke purvagrahi purvanumaanon ko dhata bataate hue kimono ko phir se viksit kiya
 In the same way, there is an interesting upheaval in the fashion world in India
 in dinon diziner sari ko kapade kii lagbhag mahatvakankshi, lagbhag krantikari pasand ke taur par dhaal de rahe hai
 After 2006, Sari has got almost a new life
 haalanki tab bhi vah bharat main sabase zyada pahana janaa vaala vastra hi thi lekin usne 'smart' tabake ke bich apni apil kho di thi
 Sabyasachi Mukherjee of Kolkata, one of India's most successful designers, started the project 'save the Saree' in 2009
 phir 2011 main french fishan diziner harmees ne hastshilp kii 28 sadiiyon ke saath bhartiya bazaar main pravesh kiya
 Each of these sarees is about 4
 5 lakh ru
 Was priced
 isse sari ko kala ke canvas ke rup main phir se jagah mili
 Today, in 2017, more than ever designers are experimenting with sarees
 sari kii charchaa se soshal media bhi garm he—twitor par 100sareepact trend karata he, jabaki fasebuk par bhi sari ko samarpit kai group hai, jaise ki cathari, for da lav of sari, saddi sari or da magic of da sareej
 Sari is now part of a digital revolution, so this is also the only garment in India that is still a part of the tradition to carry forward from generation to generation
 pichley kuch saalon ke fishan wyk ne is baat ko sabit bhi kar diya he
 Many designers are presenting collections that include sarees, while many are offering only collections of sarees
 jaise ki anavila sindhu mishra jo alag tarah kii style or lapetane kii kala ke saath use samakaleen swaroop de rahi hai
 Today's designers are looking for ways to understand and present the sari considered eternal in ways that it can compete with clothing like gowns
 in dizinron main abraham and thakor sareekhe diggaj bhi hai to vriksh kii gunjan jain sareekhee nai diziner bhi jo paaramparik bunai or kaarigari ko lekar jununee hai
 Gunjan tree has special expertise in weaving like Bomkai and Ikat in Odisha
 abraham kehete hai, ''sari kii vaapasi darasal pahchaan ko lekar badi bahes kaa hissaa he
 "and this identity stands for Draupadi standing steadfastly in the eyes of men, in a world where polarization between men and women is constantly deepening due to the great turmoil of cultural character and other socio-economic changes
" chishti kahati hai, ''bhartiya mahilaon kaa sari ke saath gaharaa rishta or pahchaan kaa bhav he, jisaki vajah se apane pahanaave kii style main tabdili laane main unhen anayas hi ek jhijak hoti he
 That is why weaving traditions are maintained in every part of the country
 '' bhavishya kii inhen sambhaavnaaon kii talash main ve kuch saal pehle desh ke bhraman par nikal padin or sari ke bare main jaankaree darj karnaa shuru kar diya
 Many myths and stories about sari were in vogue which made her look like a living garment, such as the story that the bitter gourd and fish in Bomkai are woven with the sari
 is tarah se bunakaron kii dizin diarectory ke marfat jinda yaaden kapade par aa jaati hai
 Today, sarees became more aggressive in the same development order and Google Cultural Institute and an online fashion portal Border and Fall have mentioned eighty types of sarees
 chishti ek sari skool chalaati hai jahaan aane waalon ko sari ke itihaas or use baandhne ke lagbhag 108 tareekon ke bare main bataaya jaataa he
 She says that saree is more than a personal dress
 ''1970 ke dashak ke daur tak agar koi sari pahanakar college jaati thi to use vayask hone ke baraabar maan liya jaataa tha, thik usee tarah jaise ki aaj genes ke bare main mana jaataa he
 The style of urban wear is a process dating back to the 1870s
 sari ne skirt se lekar goun tak ke samroop dikhne kii kai avasthaaon se khud ko guzaara he
 Paromita Banerjee Sarkar, 33, remembers the days when her mother came to pick her up from kindergarten school
 unke saath chalati hui ve maa ke haath ke saath-saath unki sari kaa pallu bhi pakade rahati thim
 He used to feel that mother would always be with him for his protection
 aaj kolkata main diziner kaa kaam kar raheen sarkaar anidi (neshnal institute of dizin) se snaatak hai or shilpkaaree tathaa textile kaa kaam karti hai
 At this time, she too is preparing to claim the sari on her own terms
 sarkaar kahati hai ki saalon pehle jab ve anidi main hi thim, unhone ek akhbaar main aalekh padhaa tha ki kaise banjaaraa mahilaayein apana paaramparik pahanava chhodkar aadhuniktaa ke chinh ke rup main or saamaajik str par ooncha badaae kii koshish main sari ko apana rahi hai jabaki mahanagaron main mahilaayein sari ko chhodkar vahaan kii aadhuniktaa ke chinh ke rup main kurte, palajo yaa tunic apana rahi hai
 Keeping this irony in mind, the government started thinking about what changes are coming in the saree itself
 unka maananaa he ki sari kaa bhavishya isi main he ki vah khud ko ek statement ke taur par maananaa band kar de or bina koi khaas koshish kiye ek swaabhaavik or rosemara ke pahanaave ke rup main apni jadon kii ore laut jaae
 It is also important that this is the oldest non-sewn dress in our knowledge
 san 2006 main diziner jodi abraham and thakor ne sari kii apni pehali kaarigari pesh kii—vah ek kaali jamdani thi jo dizin ke sarleekaran kii pashchimi dharanaon ke anuroop thi
 She has woven symbols of everyday life like cycle rickshaws into a sari and the sari that her show started in Delhi was finally acquired by the Victoria & Albert Museum in London
 das saal baad abraham and thakor kii dizin kii hui bade check pattern kii sari jiske saath lambii baaju vaali shart or belt pahani jaani thi, fabric of india ke naam se yojit kiye gaye sho kaa hissaa bani
 Held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2015-16, the show's curators Rosemary Krill and Divia Patel presented the rich history of the sari and its contemporary collection
 yah ek tarah se uske puranic swaroopon kii hi phir se vyakhya karne ke prati kavyanjali thi
 The show featured a saree of Abraham & Thakore with black and white checks and bright citrus yellow contrast
 sho ke curators ke anusaar sho kaa makasad yah bataanaa tha ki kaise ek jeevant udyog main kapadon kii puraani paramparaon ko shaamil kiya ja rahaa he or kaise sari ko nayaa rup mil rahaa he
 Says Abraham, "I remember when handloom saris were considered a symbol of old traditional ideas and sarees used to wear ants
 phir mere jehan main sadixan aisi soch kaa pratinidhitiv karti thim jo kalatmak tha, thodaa vamavaadi or use aksar kolhapuri chappalon or jhole ke saath milakar dekha jaataa tha
 And now, suddenly sarees have become 'fashion'
 vah vaaki fishan ho sakati he, aisa kuch jo koi tunakmizaaji yuva mahila cholii par yaa purushon kii style kii kameez par belt lagaakar bhi pahan sakati he
 This is such a wonderful thing
 ''sari par haath aajamaane vaale dizinron main keval hathkargha premi hi nahin, or bhi hai
 For example, Arjun Saluja, who has brought the label Rishta
 ve pattern kating or kapadon ke saath lagaataar prayogon ke siddhhast hai
 She has introduced many designs of sili-stitched saris as urban everyday dresses
 unki peshkash badi moulik kism kii rahi hai
 Saluja has been perhaps the most experimental in terms of making full use of Sari's abilities
 unke sile-silaae vastra hakama paint kii style yaa yahaan tak ki dhoti-sari tak kaa rup akhriyaar kar lete hai jinhen bombar jacket or yahaan tak ki ledar jacket ke saath bhi pahana ja saktaa he
 In many ways it is a crossover moment for Sari
 haath se buni apni sadiiyon ke liye (apane label ro mango ke tahat) pahachaane jane vaale sanjay garg jab pehali baar chamakdaar border vaali chanderi sadiiyon ke saath maidan main utre the to kisi ko bhi andaja na tha ki ve jaldi hi paaramparik sari ke punerjeevan or shahari bharat main sari ke 'paripakv' hone ke peeche ke vyakti ke rup main jane jaaenge
 His experiments with what he calls Indian simplification have broadened his hypothesis
 ve rani gulabi, sharbati, neembui haraa, laal or pile rangon kaa istemaal karke kehete hai ki ve hameshaa ek aisi kahani kahana chaahate the jo pehle kisi ne na likhi ho
 The sari, which was earlier dismissed as an occasional dress, now became the inspiration of her art
 garg ek nai himmati duniya kaa hissaa ban gaye the
 Garg, who was a stalwart in the current fashion stream, was followed by others
 unamem anavila sindhu mishra bhi thim jinka kahana he ki unhone apni pehali sari diwaali par pahani jab ve naunvi kaksha main thim
 Wearing a sari, she began to realize that she had suddenly become a woman from Tomboy
 haryana ke karnal main janmin, paleen-badhin mishra ne 2000 main dilli ke neshnal institute of fishan technology (nift) se grajuation kiya or nitvier dizin main visheshgyata hasil kii
 She was then working in the corporate sector when the Ministry of Rural Development asked her to work on a three-year project with NIFT in Madhya Pradesh
 ve bataati hai, ''yah 2004 kii baat he
 i started working with real people
 unhen aajeevika dene kii meri dharna hi badal gai
 After that i could never return to the corporate world
 '' tabhi ve sadixan banane ke kshetra main utar padin
 Her own story is actually an echo of the story of Sari becoming a part of modern women's cabard
 ve kahati hai, ''sari mere liye kabhi utani mahatvapurn nahin rahi
 i always wore pants and shirts
 main un mahilaon ko dekhne lagi jo saare kaam sari pahanakar kar leti thim
 i was no more outsider and i tried to accept them and then i started wearing sari
 ''2014 main lakme fishan wyk main apane pehle sho se purv do raaten unhone sho ke liye 30 sadixan lapetakar dekhne main laga deen
 She says, "today's young women don't want to wear saris
 ab yah kaam ham dizinron kaa he ki ham sari ko khubasurat dikhaaen
 For me, a sari has to live up to the fact that i want to wear it

 unhone in logon kii hatya jamini vivaad ko lekar kiye jane kii ashanka vyakt karte hue bataaya ki police ne shav ko postmortem ke liye jila sadar aspataal bhej diya he or hamalaavaron kii giraftaar ke liye chhapamari shuru kar di he
 The country's legendary industrialist Ratan Tata has expressed concern over the growing intolerance in the country
 unhone kaha ki ashishnutaa ek abhishaap, jise ham pichley kuch dinon se dekh rahe hai
 Everyone knows where intolerance is coming from: Ratan Tatartan Tatane said late on Friday night, 'I think every person knows where intolerance is coming from
 yah kya he, desh ke hajaaron-lakhon logon main se har koi ashishnutaa se mukt desh chahta he
 Earlier, while addressing the 119th Foundation Day celebrations of the Scindia School, Tata supported Congress' chief whip Jyotiraditya Scindia's point of intolerance in the Lok Sabha
 unhone kaha, ‘maharaj (sindhiya) nishishnutaake bare main apane vichaar rakhe
 This is a curse that we are seeing nowadays
 ’tata ne kaha, ‘ham aisa vaataavaran chaahate hai jahaan ham apane saathiyon se prem karen
 Do not kill them, do not take them hostage, but live in an atmosphere of harmony with each other
 ’ tata ke pehle sindhiya ne apane sambodhan main chaatro se kaha, ‘ham chaahate hai ki aap vijeta bane
 We also want you to be a thinker and debate, deliberation and disagreement are the hallmarks of a civilized society
 ’sindhiya bole- desh main ashishnutaa kaa mahaulapurv kendriya mantrijyotiraditya sindhiyane kaha ki desh main aaj ashishnutaa kaa vaataavaran he

 The state of the Lok Sabha elections is being laid on the air strike carried out by the Indian Air Force at the terrorist bases after entering Pakistan 
 ajtak ke vishesh manch 'suraksha sabha' main shirkat karte hue kendriya mantri arun jetali ne raajnneetik dalon ke prachaar main sargical strike or air strike ke istemaal ko galat maanate hai
 He said that the use of photographs of soldiers in elections should not be wrong
 main isse sahamat nahin hum or aisa karne waalon kii aalochana honi chahie
 Central Arun Jaitley said that elections should not be fought with the help of soldiers
 raajnneetik manchon par sainikon kii tasviren nahin lagaani chahie
 Therefore, the decision taken by the Election Commission is correct
 lekin jab vipaksh kii or se ye kaha jaataa he ki raajnneetik phaayde ke liye air strike kii gai to yah bhi galat he
 On the question of air strike in Balakot in Pakistan, Jaitley said that when Prime Minister Narendra Modi got information that the training of terrorists was going on in Balakot
 jaish bharat ke khilaaf hamale ke liye aatankiyon ko taiyaar kar rahaa he to to kya wo chunaav dekhte hue ruk jate?air strike ke saboot maangane waalon par vitt mantri arun jetali ne kaha ki sena ne bolaa ki hamaara target sahi tha
 Which country in the world shares confidential information? Those who are not aware of the war operation, run television debates, it is not right
 lekin raajnneeti main kuch log halkaapan laane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 On the question of increasing the defense budget, Arun Jaitley said that when there was 4 per cent, then the entire budget was 4 xxrep 4 0 crores
 lekin aaj isamen selary he, OROP or anya kharche bhi shaamil hai
 On today's arms purchase, Arun Jaitley said that this time the Air Force hit the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the Pakistan border
 is hamale se hamane wo avadharana tod di jisamen kaha jaataa tha ki bharat niyantran rekha kii pavitrataa barkaraar rakhega, kyonki hamaari karrwai ke baad duniya ke kisi bhi raashtra ne hamaari aalochana nahin kii
 The reason was that we carried out precautionary attacks in which innocent people or Pakistan's army were not targeted
 hamane sirf vahaan ke aatanki campon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya

 Harshvardhan congratulated Kejriwal
 haalanki is bahaane donon netaa nishaanaa sadhana bhi nahin bhuule
 Sheila Dixit said that Congress has not given unconditional support
 hamaara samarthan muddon par aadhaarit he
 It is now their responsibility to fulfill the big promises that have been made
 vahiin harshavardhan ne kaha ki jiske khilaaf aawaaj uthaakar kejariwal ne apni siyasat kii neenv rakhi aaj usee congress ke saath haath milakar sarkaar banane ja rahe hai
 Let me tell you that no party got majority in Delhi Assembly elections
 bijepi 32 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party got 28 seats and the Congress had to be satisfied with only 8 seats
 uparajyapal ne sabase pehle bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyauta diya haalanki party ne bahumat na hone kaa hawala dete hue is sambhaavna se inkaar kar diya

 The different stand of different leaders of the Beef Banner Party has made it quite complicated
 kuch din pehle hi manipur ke bijepi netaa ne yah saaf kiya tha ki vahaan bif bain nahin hoga
 BJP candidate n Mallaprakash in Mallapuram said, 'from my side it will be an effort to ensure the supply of beef to clean slaughterhouses of good quality
 ' aashcharya kii baat to yah he ki bijepi sadsy ne congress par kai rajyon main satta main rahane ke dauraan gohatya par bain lagane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Sriprakash said that eating beef is illegal in states where cow slaughter is banned
 yahaan yah gauratlab he ki upi main bijepi ko mili bhayankar jeet ke baad yogi sarkaar ne avaidh boojadkhaanon par roak lagane kii muhim chalaai hui he
 5 more bjp-ruled states have implemented this move of UP in their states as well, but in states where there is no ban on beef, BJP leaders are ignoring the issue
 kerala main go maance kii bikri or upbhog par koi roak nahin he

 simon ne is dweepiya raashtra ko duniya kaa ‘murkh gora’ qaraar diya jo aakshark to he lekin ‘‘ochhaa or naasamajh’’ he

 hamale ke baad desh ko pataa chalaa ki driver saleem kii vajah se bas main savaar baaki yatriyon kii jaan batch pai
 Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani himself also praised Salim for this
 mangalvaar ko surat airport par hamale main maare gaye yatriyon ko shradhanjali dene pahunche vijay roopani ne media se baat karte hue kaha ki driver ne jis tarah do kilometre tak bina ruke bas chalaakar aatankiyon kii pahunch se dur nikaala, iske liye vah unhen dhanyavad dete hai
 He also demanded the gallantry award to the driver
 lekin in sab se itar soshal media par ek tabaka aisa he jo saleem ko hi hamale ke liye doshi tehraane main juta he
 Such posts and messages are being sent in which Salim is being told to look at him with suspicion or going ahead and he is being held responsible for the attack
 is puure masale par ek baat gaur karne vaali he, wo ye kigujarat se amarnath yatriyonka ek jattha nikalataa he or is jatthe ko gujarat se amarnath lekar jane vaale driveron main ek saleem bhi rahata he
 It is a common thing for our society, but due to the kind of situation that is being tried to create within the country for some time, it becomes necessary to talk about it

 chaahe wo hindu hon yaa muslim
 There were two drivers in the bus
 ek hindu tha or ek muslim
 i don't think any passenger would have made a difference
 ’ahmedabad nivasee yogesh prajapati is yatra ke sah aayojak hai or un khushnaseeb logon main se hai jo kashmir se surakshit lautakar aae hai
 When we asked him whether the passengers had made any difference that the bus he was going in had a driver Salim? Yogesh got angry on hearing this question
 unhone gusse main hamase kaha, 'dekhie
 
 
 It does not matter at all to us or any other traveler
 hamsab ko maaloom tha ki saleem hamaare saath ja rahaa he
 He is the driver of our bus but it did not bother any of us
 ’ yogesh aage kehete hai, 'jo log hindu-muslim kar rahe hai unhen samaj kyon nahin aa rahaa ki wo sab naash kar rahe hai
 'it is clear from Yogesh's point that the way a large part of our society thinks, some people sitting on social media, people with a staunch stance on any issue or some leaders think otherwise than that
 samaaj ke is vyavhaar ko behatar tareeke se samajhane ke liye hamane hindi ke jane-maane sahityakar anil yadav se baat kii
 We asked them how to understand this behavior
 Anil said in response, 'see

 This is how things are going in our society

 Today, even though both of them have moved forward in their lives, the path of both is different, the floor is different, there is no scope for appearing on any film or show
 lekin wo kehete hai naa aap jise jitna nazarandaaj karnaa chaahate hai wo aapse takkara hi jate hai
 Something similar is going to happen with Salman and Aishwarya Raike, in fact, this weekend Aishwarya Rai will arrive on Jahan Kapil's show with the starcast of her upcoming film Ae Dil Hai Mushkil
 vahiin is weekend salmaan khan bhi colors channel ke sho big bos 10 main gharavaalon ke pehle hafte kaa rivyuu lete hue darshakon ko anterten karenge
 Now, when Aishwarya and Salman will be seen on the TV screen at the same time, then this thing will really make the fans dilemma as to whose show they miss
 kyonki kapil ke sho par pehle apni film 'jajba' ko pramot kar chukin aishwarya raay ke us episod ko khub pasand kiya gaya tha
 Watching Aishwaryasang Kapil's humor was a memorable moment for the fans and now that once again Aishwarya is coming on the show facing Kapil's mischievous questions, missing the show would mean a weekend fade

 Thus, this weekend is really going to get double dose of entertainment

 In both the shows, there will also be a competition for the TRP
 kyonki kapil kaa sho pichley kuch hafton se tiarapy reating main top 5 shoj main jagah banaae hue he
 So now the audience will have to decide whether he will look at Salman's show or would like to see aishwarya-ranbir's chemistry on Kapil's show
 
 
 
 The jakir nike ke malaysia ke alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf die bayaan kii jaanch jarikathith bayaan ke baad jakir nike ke khilaaf 115 police report darjamani londring ke aaropon ke chalate bharat ko jakir nike kii talashvivadaaspad islamic dharmprachaarak dow jakir nike malaysia main dikkatein badhane ke baad ab kanoonee daanv pech kii aad le rahaa he
 Let me tell you that the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Muhammad, has given a statement three days ago that if it is proved that Naik's activities are harmful for Malaysia then his permanent resident status can be withdrawn
 malaysian police nike ke malaysia ke alpsankhyakon ke khilaaf die bayaan kii jaanch kar rahi he
 According to the local newspaper 'malay Mail', Naik on Monday issued notice against Penang Deputy Chief Minister (2) p Ramasamy, Bagan Dalaam Assembly member Satis Muniyandi, former Ambassador Datuk Denis Ignatius and Kalang MP Charles Santiago through a law firm
 Sent
 is notice main kaha gaya he ki ye chaaron log samuchit muaavje ke saath maafi maange anyathaa do din main avmaananaa kaa cese jhelane ke liye taiyaar rahen
 These notices have been sent by the law firm Akberdin and Company
 isse pehle nike ne maanav sansaadhan mantri em kulasegaran or anya chaar ke kilaaf bhi beete shuukravaar ko police main report darj karai thi
 Naik said in the report lodged with the police that these five twisted his statement on August 8
 nike ne ramasami, muniandi, ignetius or centiago ko lau company ke jariye notice bheje hai usamen unke kuch lekhon or press relies kaa hawala diya gaya he
 According to Naik, these articles and press releases have brought him contempt
 isse pehle police main darj karai report main nike ne daawa kiya tha ki usne to malaysia kii is baat ke liye tarif kii thi ki wo kis tarah ‘hindu alpsankhyakon’ ke saath vyavhaar karata he or unke adhikaron kii raksha karata he
 Naik has been widely criticized in Malaysia
 malaysia ke alpsankhyakon ke liye die uske kathith bayaan ke baad desh bhar main uske kilaaf 115 police report darj ho chuki hai
 In the past, there was a lot of controversy over a statement allegedly made by Naik
 aarope he ki nike ne kaha tha ki malaysia main rahane vaala bhartiya samudaay malaysian pradhanmantri dow mahatir mohammad kii jagah bharat ke piem narendra modi kaa adhik samarthak he
 Naik is also accused of trying to disturb the peace of the country by making inflammatory statements against minority Hindus and people of Chinese origin in Muslim-majority Malaysia
 nike ne kathith taur par ye bhi kaha tha ki malaysia main alpsankhyak hinduon kii sthiti bharat ke alpsankhyak musalamaanon se behatar he
 India had earlier urged Malaysia to extradite Naik
 mani londring ke aaropon ke chalate bharat ko uski talash he
 The Central Information Commission has directed the Ministry of Defense to disclose the names of the ministers and officials who had approved the purchase of the six outdated helicopters
 kaig ne bhi isaki aalochana kii thi
 The Indian Navy had refused to give the information sought under the Right to Information Act, citing Section 8 (1: A) of the law, stating that disclosure of information in this regard could affect national security
 aavedak subhash agarwal ne kaig kii aapattiyon sahit saude ke sambandh main jaankaree maangi thi
 Hearing Aggarwal's petition, Information Commissioner ML Sharma questioned the Navy as to why the information was not given
 sharma ne raksha mantralay ko sambandhit mantriyon or adhikariyon ke naamon kaa khulaasa karne kaa nirdesh diya
 The Navy said there was also a question in Parliament regarding the deal and they had sent a confidential report to the Ministry of Defense
 nausena ne kaha ki vah aashwast nahin he ki jawaab sansad main pesh hua yaa nahin
 If you are a student and going through an examination system, then you know that you do not have to take only the exam here
 duniya main shaayad hi koi aisa desh ho, or aap kisi bhi non resident indian se puch sakate hai, jahaan parikshaon ko lekar dhaandhlee kii itani khabaren aati hai
 i have been doing prime time on such topics for almost two years
 har din saikadon massej or tasveeron se guzarataa hum
 i read them for hours
 main chahta hum ki aap ye baat dhyaan se sunen or is shodh par nobel dene kii zarurat nahin he
 The conclusion of this is that through these examination systems you can ruin the lives of crores of youth in India for five to ten years
 bahut hi kam parikshaayen hoti hai to ek saal se kam samay main puri hoti he
 That is, they reach joining
 zyaadaatar parikshaayen kam se kam do saal or adhik se adhik paanch saal main puri hoti hai
 Meanwhile, some exams go missing
 matlab farm bharaa gaya, pariksha hui or aath saal se riselt kaa pataa nahin
 Ask any non-resident Indian if they would like to put their children in this system, their sleep will blow
 mere research kaa ek doosraa part bhi he
 Does the rigging of these examinations separate the political consciousness of the troubled youth? The context of this question is that we generally understand that youth is a different political animal
 uski raajnneetik chetana main mukharata hoti he
 This is absolutely wrong
 jhooth he
 Rather, i have seen that the students have chosen the same governments, or their political ideology remains the same, in which they continue to give Imthan for five or six years while trapped in the clutches
 na riselt aata he na bhartee hoti he
 So governments do not even matter
 unhen chalaane vaali raajnneetik party jaanati he ki noujvaan ko pataa he ki pariksha kaa rigelt nahin aayaa, dhaandhlee hui phir bhi vah jab vot degaa to apni jati or dharm kii baat pehle karegaa
 In one line, the ruin of youth is not a part of their political decision
 ye kamaal kii original research he jo mujhase apane aap ho gai he
 And youngsters also verify that i am right
 isliye sarkaron ko bilkul chintaa karne kii zarurat nahin he
 It is not that she will not worry about being called dead, but she knows exactly this
 aap chahen to alag se research kar lijie, un chaatro ko lekar jo kisi bhi rajya main sarkari pariksha ke system main daal die gaye hai
 Said so long because you will be surprised to hear what i am going to tell you now
 madras hai court ne jo aadesh die hai, usase bharat main medical pariksha system kii pole khul jaati he
 On praying, the teacher in India is suspended, so you should pray how people are becoming doctors
 basharte prarthana se yah system thik ho jaataa he to
 This year, finger print will be taken of all medical students taking admission in the Medical College of Tamil Nadu
 is saal rajya ke privet or sarkari collejon main 4250 chaatro ne admician liya tha
 All of them passed the National eligibility-cum-entrance Test (NEET) exam
 ol india test he ye
 a division bench of Justice N
 Kirubkaran and P
 Velamurugan of the Madras High Court has given this ruling
 court ne National Testing Agency se kaha he ki sabhi chaatro ke anguuthe ke nishaan sibisiaidi ko de, jo jaanch kar rahi he taaki yah satyapit ho sake ki admician lene vaale chaatro ne hi pariksha di thi
 No one else has replaced him
 neshnal testing agency hi neet kii pariksha karaati he
 The Directorate of Medical Education has emailed all the colleges that all the first year students will get three-to-three thumb prints and they will be matched
 ye nishaan dean offis main liye jaaenge
 In the presence of three professors
 anatami, phiziolji or baecomestry professor ke saamne in 4200 chaatro ko apane anguuthe kaa nishaan dena hoga
 Students, professors and deans will then sign a form
 is farm kii do pratiyaan cield lipaphe main paanch dinon ke andar-adar medical shiksha nideshaalay bheji jaaengi
 Forensic experts will then investigate
 sochie rajya bhar main admician lene vaale 4200 chaatro ke anguuthe ke nishaan kaa milan kiya jayega
 This is a medical examination
 court main atirikt mahadhivaktaa pi es arvind pandian ne kaha he ki chah chaatro ke maamle main pataa chalaa he unki jagah kisi or ne pariksha di he
 This examination has been done in other states
 kuch privet koching centre kaa haath ho saktaa he
 The judges have also made the CBI a party in this case so that investigations can be conducted across India
 faisle main media main chhapi aisi khabaron kaa hawala diya gaya he
 It has been said that in Karnataka, the news of fraud has been published in the admission of medical college
 ek tarah se sibiai ko party banane kaa makasad yahi he ki puure desh main jaanch ho kyonki chaatr ke badale kisi or ne pariksha di he or yah pariksha duusare rajya main hui he
 In this case, someone giving an exam in lieu of something called an impersonator in English has not been arrested
 jajon ne apane faisle main kaha he ki 38000 seat hai or 14 lakh chaatro ne pariksha di thi
 Obviously there will be a fierce competition for admission and such fraud can happen
 jiske kaaran jo yogya chaatr he, use mauka nahin mila hoga
 The court has also said that everyone will have to work together to make Neet's examination flower-proof
 medical council of india, rajya sarkarein or centre sarkaar ko milakar kaam karnaa hoga
 Finger print checks need to be done and face recognition techniques are used
 hamaare sahyogi sam dainiel ko jaanch esansi ne bataaya ki ghar vaale 20-20 lakh dekar bachche kii jagah pariksha dene vaale kaa intazaam karte hai
 There have been six arrests
 aaj ek pita putr kii giraftaar hui
 The father himself is a doctor, in a government hospital
 usne vellore ke agent ke zarie mumbai main impersonator kaa intazaam kiya
 Parents are giving their child a medical seat by paying Rs 20 lakh
 pita ne bachche kaa jivan barbaad kiya isliye bachche ko bel mil gai
 The court has also said that the media should not show the face of the students so that they do not come under unnecessary pressure
 jinaki giraftaar hui he unhen bhi counselling di gai he taaki ve koi or kadam na uthaa len
 In most of the cases known so far, this game mostly takes place in the examination centers of North India
 9 aktubar ko karnataka ke chaar medical collejon main chapa padaa tha
 All the four colleges belong to the Congress leader
 is chaape ke dauraan paise dekar seat bechney ke dastauez bhi baraamad kiye gaye the
 This is mentioned by two judges in their decision
 media main chhapi khabaron ke anusaar karnataka ke in chaar collejon main 100 se 125 karod main 185 siten bechi gai hai
 50 to 60 lakhs have been taken for a medical seat
 zaahir he is network kii jaanch to honi chahie
 It also exposes the face of our society
 ham beemaari ke vakt sabase acha doctor khojate hai lekin doctor banaate vakt paise dekar kisi ko bhi doctor bana dete hai
 What do you expect in such a society
 jajon ko is puure network main koching centre kaa khel nazar aata he
 That is why they have asked how many such students are admitted in the first time and how many are those who have to try many times
 saath hi kitne aise chaatr hai jinhone koi koching nahin lee or unka medical hua
 In 2017, a girl named s Anita committed suicide in Tamil Nadu itself
 rajya ke board main use 98 pratishat ank mili the
 There were 1176 marks out of 1200
 taminalnadu main pehle board ke aadhaar par medical main admician miltaa tha
 This number was enough to become Anita's doctor
 agar ban jaati to anita apane samudaay or gaanv kii pehali doctor hoti he
 In the same year, the system of NEET examination came into force in Tamil Nadu
 anita ke pita dihadi mazdoor hai
 Anita went to the Supreme Court against Neet saying that this system is against poor students
 anita ne aatmahatya kar lee
 This was a major case in Tamil Nadu
 baad main anita kii yaad main 45 lakh kii laagat se ek librari bhi banaai gai lekin anita kii ladaai kahin pahunchi nahin
 In the month of June this year also, three students committed suicide in Tamil Nadu after NEET examination
 teenon ladkiyaan thim
 Ritu Shri's father used to work as a daily wage laborer in a textile factory
 em monisha or en vaishia ke pita machuaare the
 Think once, all these four girls who committed suicide were poor
 media report ke anusaar tamilnadu main pichley dhai saal main neet ke kaaran 6 bacchon ne aatmahatya kii he isliye vahaan yah andolan chalata he ki unke rajya ko neet se alag rakhaa jaae kyonki neet privet koching system ko badhaava detaa he
 Poor students are left behind in that
 times aaf india ke chennei beuro ke e raghuraaman ne 17 aktubar yani aaj hi report kii he
 In it Raghuraman has told that many times the students who give NEET pass because they also understand the system of this exam
 unki report ke anusaar pehle kai baar pariksha dekar paas karne vaale 12 pratishat hi the
 This year the number has increased to 70 percent
 yah data bataata he ki kis tarah se neet ke kaaran koching industry bad rahi he
 Raghuraman has written that in just three years, more than ten thousand training centers of NEET coaching have started in Tamil Nadu
 500 karod se bhi adhik kaa kaarobaar ban gaya he
 All the major programs of the state are organized at the Parade Ground in Dehradun, but these days students of almost all private Ayurvedic colleges of Uttarakhand are sitting on dharna and fast unto death on the parade ground
 inamen se kai chaatro kii tabiyat bhi karaab ho chuki he
 These students first held protests in their respective colleges and are now forced to sit on the parade ground
 in chaatro kii maang he ki 2015 kaa uttarakhand sarkaar kaa wo shasnadesh waapas liya jaae jisamen privet ayurvedic medical collejon kii fees 80 hazaar se badhaakar 2 lakh 15 hazaar karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya tha
 Let us tell you that according to an order of the Supreme Court it is not in the jurisdiction of the state government to increase the fees
 ye adhikaar shulk nirdhaaran cameti ko he jo har rajya main hycourt ke ritred jaj kii adhyakshata main gathit hoti he
 But the state government issued the mandate regardless
 shasnadesh ke kilaaf vidhyaarthiyon ne nainital main uttarakhand hycourt main apil kii
 The single judge bench of the High Court ordered the government to refund the increased fees charged from the students
 peeche kii taarikh se fees na badhaai jaae or 2019 se aage kii fees shulk nirdhaaran cameti tay kare
 Private colleges appealed in the High Court to protest the single bench verdict
 hycourt kii do jajon kii bench ne bhi single bench ke faisale ko qaayam rakhaa or ek baar phir badi hui fees waapas lene ke aadesh die
 Despite this, private colleges were not ready to accept and there was pressure on students to pay increased fees continuously
 kai chaatro ko virodh karne par pratadit bhi kiya gaya
 If the High Court order did not apply, the students filed an application for contempt of the High Court order
 avmaananaa kii arji par sunwaayee hui or hycourt ne nijee collejon ko aadesh diya ki wo court ke puraane aadesh par amal karen
 But colleges are not ready to accept
 aapako bataa den ki uttarakhand main baba ramdev kii patanjali yogapith naam kaa nijee ayurvedic college to he hi, kai anya college hai jinamein rajya ke nami giraami netaaon or udyogpatiyon kaa paisa laga he
 On this matter, both the ruling party and the opposition stand together in Uttarakhand because the opposition is also maintaining silence over the High Court order
 is maamle main uttarakhand kii kuladhipati yani rajyapal kii udaseenta bhi samaj se pare he jabaki chaatro or unke abhibhavakon ne kai baar unase apil kii or is maamle kii gambhirtha se avgat karaayaa lekin kisi ko chaatro kii parvaah nahin

 book:ishk main shahar hona (laprek)lekhak:raveesh kumaarchitrankan:vikram nayakapablisher:raajakmal prakashankimat:99 ruperwaish kumaar apane shahar nayana ke saath ‘selfi’ le rahe the
 The moment he took his 'selfie', i and some people started trying to take it off in their phones
 ‘selfi’ lene ke bich raveesh kii ek nigaah tasviir utaarte ham logon par padati he
 Today, after reading the book 'ishq Mein Shahar Hoaana', i am feeling that gaze
 maine bhi to vahi kaam kiya, jo premi jodon ke saath shaharon main hota he
 Take away their privacy
 pyaar ke palon main ghurti nigahon se eks-re utaarna
 Regardless, these eyes would have been making those couples feel like scrambling meat instead of mingling
 us din ‘ishk main shahar hona’ kitaab ke ek kaarykram main raveesh kii wo nigaah mujhe na dekhati to shaayad main is kitaab ko behatar tareeke se na samaj paata
 Thank you Ravish for that look and the book 'ishq Mein Shahar Hona'
 ab ishk karne or ishk karte logon ko dekhne main ham kasbaa se shahar ho gaye hai
 'there are only two types of people who want to see a safe place in Delhi, who have to love and who have to see people while loving them
 ghabrahat main donon itani teji se uthe ki paas kii jhaadiyon main bhi halchal much gai
 Lovers felt that the police had arrived
 uskaa kaha yaad rahaa- yah kaisaa shahar he? har vakt sharir kaa peechha karata rahata he
 'ravish Kumar and painter Vikram Nayak's book' Ishq Mein Shahar Hoga 'brings us to us
 khud se milanaa bahut jaruri he
 Without meeting ourselves, we cannot meet others better, cannot love
 kitaab ke har laghu prem katha(laprek) ke saath vikram ke banaae chitra kahani main chup rahane vaali mashooqa kii tarah rahete hai, jo bas apane bhaavon or rekhaon se sab kuch kah jate hai
 And with this sweetheart, Ravish's lovers keep talking sweetly in love like a new lover
 ye baaten hamen kitaab se jodatii hai
 Somewhere in Ishq itself because of going through such feelings, and somewhere because of loving couples staring at themselves
 ‘ishk main shahar hona’ hamen vajah detii he ki kyon ham ishk main lo bajet rahakar or saadagi ke saath bhi bevajaah pyaar or khushi ke pal dhundh sakate hai
 'there is no just watching in love
 andekha karnaa bhi hota he
 'it is like how someone can tell love in such a few words with such simplicity
 raveesh kii kahani main koi hasina, divaana nahin hota he
 The courtship is not a cinema hall
 kyonki aap or ham bhi to jab ishk main hote hai to kisi ke liye kuch hote nahin he
 Those who are just themselves remain
 sachhee mohabbat bhi to hamen ham banaae rakhti he
 'ishq Mein Shahar Hain' shows us the strangest part of our cities, which at first sight is only the pillar of the metro or the lower part of the flyover to hide when it rains
 par ‘shauk-e-didaar’ vaali najar se yahi jagah hamen minuton main tajmahal ke tohfe se bhi gahare ehsaas de jaati he
 'to go to places unknown to the places of acquaintance is to be a city in love
 ’‘koun he original yahaan
 This is your love between me, it has happened among many before it is known
 ’aksar ham jo kitaab padhate hai
 We twist his good pages
 yakeen maniye aap jab is kitaab ko puraa kar chuke honge, tab aapaki kitaab bhi meri kitaab kii hi tarah lagbhag har panna mude hone kii vajah se moti ho chuki hogi
 Or blue or black from the pan
 vikram nayak ke khubasurat chitron se bachaakar anderline kijiega
 In the days of love, this book will soak you back in love like the soft fountains of cotton
 ‘chalo na ishk ke liye kuch karte hai
 How long will we usually hide under the Peepal tree? If the berries also fall, then it seems that some khap is being shot
 ''ishk main shahar hona’ kitaab ham logon ke liye isliye bhi padhanaa jaruri he
 Because we have included Ishq within certain limits
 uske kuch managasaint paimaane set kar rakhe hai
 Whereas in love there is nothing like border
 sirf do log hote hai
 Some things happen between these people
 ladaaiyaan hoti hai
 There is silence
 ishk main hote hue baat na kiye jane kaa bhi ek gale se chaati tak jaataa hua ehsaas hota he
 This realization, even after the lovers do not talk to each other, it makes us believe that we are in love and neither talking is the EMI of Ishq, which needs to be filled so that its value is realized, even after getting it
 ‘to kahana kya he janu? vah ye ki ham kachra failaane ko kahana kehete hai
 If two moments of silence in love are clear, what will be left? Cleaning or garbage? ”while walking in the caves of Chhatarpur, both of them started asking for vows for each other to convert their desires into Khwamkhah bhakti
 andheri gupha main wo thaharne kaa naatak karata, vah darane kaa
 Touch would have been like the blessing that they wished in the temples' The most interesting fact while reading this book is that Ravish wrote these followers not for the book, just for himself or just to say
 
 in laprekon ko padhakar khud ke ateet yaa bhavishya main ishk kii kalpanaaon ko karne main madad milti he
 Sitting alone, remembering stories of your love gives you a reason to smile
 kitaab kii bhoomika damdaar he
 This role gives Ishq a new reason to think
 ‘gussa kyon karti ho
 i take a break brake main hi mere sawaal lucks or liril se nahaane chale jate hai or jab lautate hai to doraa baniyaan pahanakar
 Uff, this anchor has become aashiq-awara
 suno tum tivi nahin chhod sakate? nahin ye saans kii beemaari he
 This will leave me, not me
 
 
 
 
 
 '
 ek laprek main ye line padhakar sochane laga ki ye safed baalo vaala shaks jab nahin rahegaa tab kya hoga
 By then, what Ravish must have said, how much will have been left
 
 Facebook, Twitter states, news, reports, books and life
 raveesh kii bhi or hamaari bhi
 All this while thinking that there was a tear on the 'border of border' of the eye
 aansu aankh ke raste neeche to nahin aayaa lekin abhi likhte vakt gale par kahin tehra hua he
 First thought, don't write this thing log pesha ek hone kii vajah se dikhaava yaa makkhanbaji kah sakate hai
 But i was able to write because a voice came from the heart, 'in Ishq, the city is not just about a girlfriend or a lover
 pasand ke logon ke bhi hua jaataa he
 If i start to care about the gazing eyes, then i will not be able to feel myself and love by being in love in the city
 isi laprek main premi kii saansen rukne kaa haq se bharaa pyaara jawaab diya tha premika ne,’
 
 
 
 chup manahuus!’ The new CBI director Anil Sinha has made it clear that he is not going to come under any pressure
 unka makasad eemaandaaree ke saath apane kaam ko anjaam dena he
 Sinha also emphasized that the investigating agency would take care that no innocents are exploited
 beete 2 disambar ko desh kii sabase badi jaanch agency ke pramukh kaa pad sambhaalane vaale anil sinha aaj'agenda ajtak'main shaamil hue
 Regarding the media headlines and CBI image, Anil Sinha said, "it is not appropriate to talk about those who are not here
 jab bhi ham surkhiyaan denge, sahi maamalon main denge
 Our officers who have said the same thing should work impartially
 agar ham aise kaam karenge to logon kaa bharosa badhegaa
 Some people will be satisfied, some will not
 lekin hamen tathyon or sabooton ke saath adaalat ko santusht karnaa jaruri he
 Why should we care about anyone? haa ye jarur dhyaan rakhana he ki kisi bekasoor kaa shoshan naa ho
 Strict action will be taken against those who are wrong
 safedposh logon se jude maamalon main dabaav ke sawaal par anil sinha ne kaha, 'aapane cese main hamen kahin dagamagaate hue dekha? jab ham is tarah ke cese par kaam karte hai to ham baariki se jaanch karte hai
 Never act in haste and haste
 kisi khaas mindset ko lekar agar jaaenge to rigelt umdaa nahin hote
 Court has to be satisfied
 isliye ham apane kaam ke har pahalu ko behatar tareeke se karnaa jaruri samajhate hai
 The CBI director praised his team and said that we have a great team of select people
 desh ke chuninda afasaron ko liya gaya he
 We have always given the message that whatever work is there, do it well
 nattejey kii chintaa naa karen
 Do not come under pressure, just work well
 apane kaam ko nirbhikta se karen or aage badhen
 Sinha said that the CBI investigates about 1,200 cases every year
 hamaare liye har cese ahm hota he
 Our priority is that whether it is a small case or a big one, whether it becomes a headline or not
 ham sabhi ko achche se handle karte hai
 In the environment of corruption, our responsibility is increased and we should work better
 espiji main apane kaarykaal ke bare main sinha ne kaha ki vahaan agar ham galati karte hai to bada nuksaan ho saktaa he
 That's why they work well
 hamane vahaan bhi kai is tarah kii baaten dhyaan rakhni hoti hai
 In response to a question, he said that it would not be right to talk about any particular case here but one thing to say is that the laws of every country are different
 aaj kii taarikh main ye bataanaa uchit nahin hoga ham kis cese par kis tarah se kaam kar rahe hai or kahaan tak panhuche hai
 There are some things that should not be known to the people
 inhen saarvajanik nahin kiya ja saktaa
 On the misuse of CBI, Anil Sinha said that he had experience of working in the police for almost 35 years before becoming a special director
 kabhi koi diarection nahin mila
 Whatever he did, he did it himself
 kuch logon kii ummid rahi hogi par mujhe is tarah kaa koi anubhav nahin rahaa
 i did not see any pressure
 'pashchim bengal ke sarada chitfund cese ke bare main sinha ne kaha, 'ham to apana kaam karte hai
 Who suits us, whom does not suit, it does not make sense to us
 naa hi kisi ne mujhe kuch kaha or naa hi hamane kisi se kuch kaha
 We are taking action on the basis of facts
 bas ham apana kaam puri eemaandaaree se kar rahe hai
 The CBI director said, 'all the cases that happen are with the court
 kuch gine chune cese hote hai, jise supreme court monitor karata he
 It benefits from that
 kai baar kuch chhot jaataa he to wo bhi ham dekh pate hai
 Get to learn
 ham nyaayalay ke faisle ko jaj nahin kar sakate hai
 On the rebuke from the Supreme Court, Sinha said that if the work is not completed or corrected, there should be reprimand
 daant-fatkaar milti he to use positive lenaa chaiye
 The work should be done better
 ghar main daant padati thi to kya karte the?special cese ke maamle main unhone bataaya ki hamane ek esaiti banaai he jo cese ko handle karne ke liye sakasham hai
 There are other cases on which we are working
 hamane team se kaha ki saare sabooton ko parakh len
 Doing the right thing is the right thing
 rajyon main chal rahe maamalon par unhone kaha ki jab koi badi cheez ho rahi hoti he to aisa nahin ki ham unase anjaan hon
 We work for our database, but we will not interfere in anyone else's work
 anil sinha ne saaf sandesh diya ki desh main karpshan se ladane ke liye apane andar ke laalach se bhi ladanaa hoga
 Gotta control myself
 isi kii vajah se cese safar karte hai
 On lack of man power, he said that 'enuff never happens
 har kisi ko kami se jujhna padataa he
 Use what is right
 jahaan jarurat hoti he to hamen sarkaar se miltaa bhi he
 What we have now, despite not being enough, they are capable enough to work well on all the cases
 apni niyukti ke bare main unhone kaha ki unhen andaja bhi nahi tha ki wo sibiai ke nideshak banenge
 He said, 'I didn't know i was hungry
 main khaanaa khaane ja rahaa tha
 The family watched on TV but could not believe it
 raat ko dedh baje mujhe diopiti se notification mila tab mujhe vishwaas hua
 It came to my mind that i have been given a big responsibility
 sahi kaam karne ke liye ishwar meri madad karen
 Just prayed that
 'sibiai pramukh ne kaha ki sangeet jivan main rang bharte hai
 But there is a need to fight the infuriating things which are disgraceful
 taaki hamaara kisi bhi tarah kaa nuksaan naa ho

 congress ne aaj ek teen saal puraani video clip jari kiya, jisamen uma bharti ne narendra modi ko kathith rup se vinaash kaa agent bataaya tha or unke gujarat vikaas ke daawey ko ‘paakhand’ kaha tha
 Uma had split from the BJP at that time and was the president of the Bharatiya Janashakti Party
 audio video prastutikaran main uma ne kaha ki unhone hinduon ko utana bhaybheet kabhi nahin dekha, jitna gujarat main dekha he
 Gujarat has now become a dreaded state
 congress pravaktaa abhishek singhvi ne mana he ki ye video sidi us samay kii he, jab uma bhaajapa main nahin thi
 In this, Uma is seen rejecting the Gujarat Chief Minister's claim for development and Hindutva
 ‘‘main unhen 1973 se jaanati hum
 
 vah vikaas purush nahin balki vinaash purush hai
 Their claim of GDP growth and upgrading the people of BPL to APL is false
 
 Gujarat has become a big debtor in the last five years
 gujarat ko na to ram mili or na hi roti
 It should be freed from men of destruction
 ' Uma said in this video, '
 
 It is the media that made Modi so big
 ' video clip ke bare main singhvi ne kaha ki uma ne ye baaten chunaav ke vakt nahin kahi hai
 If someone does not comment like this on election days, it means that there is more truth in it
 unhone jo kuch bhi kaha tha, usase inkaar nahin kiya he
 These remarks about bjp's prime ministerial candidate have been made by senior leaders like Uma Bharti
 ye poochne par ki party ne chunaav ke vakt ye sidi kyon jari kii, singhvi ne kaha ki akhil bhartiya congress cameti kii press conference kaa mukhya bindu haalanki ye nahin he, lekin isse pataa chalata he ki bhaajapa main aise hajaaron log hai, jo modi ko taanashaah maanate hai, vinaash purush maanate hai or ye maanate hai ki gujarat vikaas ke bare main unke daawey jhuthe hai

 rajasthan main congress ke ek vidhayak ke vivaadit bol par vivaad ho gaya he
 MLA Ramlal Meena has made a comment against former Chief Minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Vasundhara Raje, whose video has gone viral
 is video main congress kah rahe hai ki siem vasundhara raaje apane kaarykaal main vikaas kaary nahin kar pain, kyonki vah kisi or kaam main vyast raheen
 Ramlal Meena, who first became a Congress MLA from Pratapgarh Assembly seat, during the public hearing on Sunday in Veeravali, allegedly said that Vasundhara Raje was busy opening liquor bottles while development work was interrupted
 soshal media par viral hue video main meena ne kaha, 'mukhyamantriashok gahalotadwara kiye ja rahe kaaryon ke liye taaliyaan bajaai jaani chahien
 He (gehlot) started working in the right direction as soon as he took power
 vasundhara raaje sharaab kii bottle kholane main vyast raheen or kaam nahin kiya
 This comment of the Congress MLA is being considered indecisive and his statement has created a ruckus in the politics of the state
 abhi congress sarkaar ko bane ek maheenaa bhi nahin hua he, aise main sattadhari dal ke vidhayak kii aisi bayaanbaji vivaad kaa hissaa ban gai he
 Let me tell you that in December 2018, Ramlal Meena won the Pratapgarh assembly seat by defeating bjp's Hemant Meena by 16680 votes
 uttarakhand main panchayat chunaavon kaa bigul baj chukaa he
 The three-tier panchayat elections in the remaining 12 districts of the state, except Haridwar district, are to be held in three phases
 in jilon main kul votaron kii sankhya 43,11,423 he
 These voters will vote for a total of 66,399 posts of Zilla Panchayat, Kshetra Panchayat and Gram Panchayat
 inamen ye matadaata gram pradhan, gram panchayat sadsy, kshetra panchayat sadsy or jila panchayat sadsy kaa chunaav sidhe karenge
 The state government of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had passed the Panchayati Raj Amendment Act introduced to prevent the parents of more than two children from contesting elections
 lekin nainital hycourt ne ise gram pradhan ke chunaav ke liye amaanya kar diya
 This decision was challenged in the Supreme Court by the BJP government through a special permission petition, but there was no relief there either
 supreme court ne hycourt ke faisle par roak lagane se inkaar kar diya
 These elections are nothing short of a litmus test for the state's Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se lagaataar jeet kaa paracham laharaa rahi bhaajapa ke liye in tristareey panchayat chunaavon main yah silsilaa barkaraar rakhane kii chunauti hogi
 The result of these elections will also be considered as the report card of the Chief Minister for two and a half years of functioning
 is dauraan hue sthaneey nikaay, nagar nigam chunaav, sahakaarita chunaav se lekar upachunaav or loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bhaajapa ne jeet hasil kii or mukhyamantri ne inhen apane kaarykaal par janata kii muhar ke rup main bhunaaya
 However, it is also a reality that usually the ruling party has been winning panchayat elections in the state
 jin baarah jilon main tristareey panchayat chunaav hone hai, unamem chah jile jila panchayat or gram pradhan kii siton ke lihaaj se mahatvapurn hai
 That is why the attention of political parties of the state is highest in these six districts
 ye chah jile hai—almoda, tehri, pithauragarh, paudi, dehradun or udhamsingh nagar
 Of these, the Zilla Panchayat members have more than 30 seats
 almoda or tehri jaise parvatiy jilon main jila panchayat sadasyon kii siten dehradun or udhamsingh nagar se bhi zyada hai
 In both these places, the seats of Zilla Panchayat members are 45-45, while in Dehradun 30 and from Udham Singh Nagar, 35 Zila Panchayat members are elected
 vahiin, champavat jaise jile bhi hai, jahaan sirf 15 jila panchayat siten hai
 While the BJP has created a strong organization in the state, the condition of the organization of the main opposition party of the Congress is that Pritam Singh, who was elected the state president, has not yet made a new executive
 aise main congress sanghathan kii kamjor sthiti kaa andaja lagaana mushkil nahin he
 This is the reason why many Congress leaders have left the party and joined the BJP just before these elections
 congress apane sanghathan ko majboot karne ke bajaae sarkaar kii galatiyon ke aadhaar par tristareey panchayat chunaav jeetne kaa daawa kar rahi he
 According to political observers, these elections are also important for the Congress as these are the last elections to be held before the 2022 assembly elections
 in chunaavon main praapt siton se rajnatik dalon ko rajya main apana janaadhar dikhaane kaa mauka milegaa
 That is why the bjp's organization seems to be taking these elections seriously
 iske baavjood, congress ke pradesh adhyaksh preetam singh kaa daawa he ki pradesh kii janata bhaajapa kii sarkaar kii kathani or kerani se santusht nahin he
 He says, "outrage among the people is increasing, the Congress will directly benefit from it
 party chunaavon ke liye nishchit ranneeti ke tahat aage bad rahi he
 Its results will tell what is the ground reality of BJP
 ''vahiin, bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh ajay bhatta kehete hai, ''centre main modi sarkaar or pradesh main trivendra sarkaar kii nitiyon ke prati janata ashanvit he

 Zoya said, "everything is fine, but the officers are coughing like old men

 Last night we went to Rukhsana Baji's place

 His Simba has been missing for three days
 ''kuch der tak abba ke phone kaa signal kamjor padaa or ek-do baar helo-helo kehane ke baad phone rakh diya
 The phone rang again after a few waqfes
 zoya ne bataaya ki rukhsana baaji do din se phone karke guzarish kar rahi thim ki tum sab aa jaao
 Everyone find him, pray for him to return home
 abba ne poocha, ''simba kii umr kitni he? '' jawaab aayaa, ''koi do saal kaa hoga
 Came from Kashmir last year
 ''ek saal kii umr main koun maa-baap apane lakhte jigar ko khud se alag karegaa? shaayad kashmir main khun-kharabe ke daur main koi baccha yateem ho gaya hoga
 The matter seemed interesting, so Abba asked, "it is a matter of great regret
" uske waldan ko gumshudagi kii khabar de di gai he? '' jawaab mila, ''nahin

 mangani ke din ujma ke gharavaalon ne ladke ke gharavaalon ko kai tarah ke tohfe-tahaef die, jisamen ek saal kaa simba bhi shaamil tha
 Jamal, the cousin of Rukhsana Baji, said, "baji, if you took Simba with her nazkhara, then after a year, Uzma's house will send her to your house after Nikah
" agar uski parvarish main koi kami hui to ujma kii ammaa shaayad apane faisle par dobaaraa sochen kyonki agar ek 'bille' kaa khyaal nahin rakh saktin to unki beti ke naaj-nakhre kaise uthaaengi
 "in an atmosphere of laughter and joy, Rukhsana Baji laughed Jamal Bhai's words into laughter
 lekin jab se simba gaayab hua he tab se unki baat unako baar-baar yaad aa rahi he
 He is afraid of Uzma's Valdain more than Simba

 At the same time, when it comes to the education of the girl, then the challenge of security outside the house becomes the biggest obstacle
 lekin digital hoti duniya ne shikshak or chaatr donon ko technology se jodne kaa kaam kiya
 The preparation of school and competitive examinations based on traditional education material also got a new dimension

 You are going to make people talk about the truth of the floods in Bihar
 baadh peediton ko madad pahunchane ke bihar sarkaar ke tamaam daavon kii kalai kholti 'aaj tak' team kii ye report he
 For the past 18 days, 15 people were forced to live in a house on a tree in Bagder village, about 15 km from Bhagalpur
 chaaron taraf pani hi pani or ye log bhukhe-pyaase ped par tange hue rahtakarmiyon kaa takataki lagaae intjaar hi karte rahe
 Family was trapped in the floods for 18 days
 It is a matter of surprise that no relief workers could reach these people in 18 days
 itane dinon main 'aaj tak' team pehali baar esadiaref (rajya aapadaa raahat bal) ke javaanon ke sathrahalekar in tak pahunchi
 What the 'aaj Tak' team saw there was astonishing
 logon ne ped par hi ghar bana liya tha
 The important items of the bicycle, etc
, which could be saved from the flood, were also kept on the tree as well
 logon ne bataaya ki itane dinon main wo sattu khaakar hi kisi tarah apni jaan bachaae rakhi
 The entire family of Parmanand Mandal was one of the people living in the shelter of the family
 paramanand ke parivaar main patni, do bete, do betiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 According to Parmanand, what he faced in the last 18 days was no less than hell
 neeche utar nahin sakate the kyonki chaaron taraf pani ke bich saanp-bichchhu ke kaatane kaa bhi khatra tha
 The family's refusal to go to the relief camp, on Wednesday, SDRF Inspector DN Ojha brought relief material to the flood victims in Bagader, as well as transporting them to the relief camp
 lekin paramanand mandal ke parivaar ne shivi main jane se inkaar kar diya
 Parmanand said that if he left, whatever was left would be stolen
 bataa den ki beete dinon rashtriya janata dal ke pramukh lalu yadav ne baadh ko lekar bayaan diya tha ki ganga maiyaa ghar ke daravaaje tak aa rahi he to logon ko saubhagyashaalee samajhnaa chahie
 Those who gave such insensitive statements must have seen the pain of these people by forcing them to settle on trees in Bagder
 aapako bataa den ki dilli police kii ore se mili jaankaree ke mutabik pichley saal kul 462 hatyaon ke maamle main 18 pratishat cese aise the jinamein maamuli baat par jhagada hua tha

 Leader of Opposition in North MCD, Rakesh Kumar has alleged that except the announcement of not raising the property tax rates by the chairman of the standing committee in the special meeting of the budget is nothing but a lie
 rakesh kumaar ne aarope lagaaya ki kataaria ne 3 janvari 2018 ko sthai samiti kii baithak main rihaishi or camershal sampatti kar kii daron ko badhaane kaa prastaav paas kiya, lekin ab nigam kii bajet sabha main sampati kar naa badhaane kii juthi ghoshnaa karke dilli kii janata se jhooth bolne kaa kaam kiya he
 On Thursday, Dilip Pandey also said that the rate of taxation of property tax for 'A' and 'B' category for residential properties for the year 2017-18 was 12 percent
 si,di or i shrenee ki sampatti kar dar 11 pratishat thi tathaa epa
 Yes
 ech shrenee kii 7 pratishat sampatti kar dar thi
 Whereas recently the Standing Committee raised these rates for the year 2018-2019 to 20 per cent for a category, 18 per cent for b category, 14 per cent for C, d and e categories and for F, g and h categories
 9 percent

 Bharatiya Janata Party's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy raised some questions related to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in Parliament on Tuesday
 in sawaalon ke bahaane vah congress par hamalaa karnaa chaahate the, lekin aisa karte samay vah yah bhi bhul gaye ki rashtriya savayan sevak sangh ko bachaane ke chakkar main ve pandit jawaharlal nehru or sardaar vallabh bhai patel jaise mahaan netaaon kii manahani kar rahe hai
 Just before Gandhi's assassination, those who had sat with him for an hour were none other than Sardar Patel and his daughter
 baharhaal mahatma gandhi kii hatya kii ghatana kaa varnan alag-alag jagah puri pramanikta ke saath darj he
 Among these, the most reliable book is written by Pyarelal, personal secretary of Mahatma Gandhi
 angreji mend last fejor hindi main purnahuti naam se likhi is pustak main gandhi ji ke antim varshon kaa puraa lekha-jokha he
 The role of this book is Dr
 rajendra prasad ne likhi he
 Three bullets hit by Gandhiji: Swami's first question is how many bullets were fired by Gandhiji? Pyarelal gives a full description of it like this, 'the crowd turned away and gave way to go to Gandhiji and reach the stage
 jab gandhi ji ne bheed ke abhivadan kaa uttar dene ke liye donon ladakiyon ke kandhe par se haath hataae, usee samay koi aadmi dahini ore se bheed ko cheerata hua aage aayaa
 Manu held his hand and tried to stop him, but he slammed Manu and folded his hands in pranam and bowed in front of Gandhi ji and fired three bullets one after the other with his seven cartridge pistol
 usne waar itane nikat se kiya tha ki chalaai hui goliyon main se ek baad main gandhi ji ke kapadon kii tahon main pai gai
 The first bullet hit the stomach on the right two and a half inches above the navel and three and a half inches on the right side of the midline
 duusari goli madhyarekha se ek inch daanyin ore saatvin pasli ke neeche lagi or teesri goli stnegar se ek inch upar or madhya rekha se chaar inch dur vaksh kii baayin ore lagi
 The first and second shots crossed the back and went out
 teesri fefde main jaakar baith gai
 Gandhiji's leg was getting up on the first shot
 vah neeche ho gaya
 Gandhiji was standing on the feet till the second and third shots were fired
 iske baad ve jameen par lumiq gaye
 The last words that came out of his mouth were: Rama
 ram
 There was no question of taking him to the hospital
 The second question Swami raised was why Mahatma Gandhi was not taken to the hospital after being shot and his post-mortem was not done
 vakil buddhi se upje yah sawaal atikalapnashiltaa main buniyadi tathyon se dhyaan bhatakaane vaale lagate hai
 First of all, some of the best doctors of the country used to stay with Bapu for some time before the last fast
 or jab unhi doctoron ne baapu ko mrit ghoshit kar diya to unke shav ko aspataal le jane kaa sawaal kahaan se uthta
 Pyarelal, who was himself present at the Birla Bhavan at the time of the murder, wrote a description of it, 'sardar Patel was the first to reach Birla Bhavan among Gandhiji's companions
 ve unke paas baith gaye, naadee dekhi or mana kii ab bhi dhimi-dhimi chal rahi he
 Dr
 bhargav ne naadee dekhi, baad main ankhon ke koyon kii pariksha kii or dhire se bole- mare hue das minute ho gaye hai
 Dr
 jivraj mehta dow
 Bhargava's face was standing in front of him
 unhone vednaa se sir hilaa diya
 Aura and Manu started crying bitterly
 ’gandhiji nahin chaahate the ki ho shav kii cheerfaadisi sawaal ke agle hisse main swami ne poocha he ki baapu kaa postmortem kyon nahin karaayaa gaya? shaayad swami ko yaad hoga ki antim upwas ke dauraan jab baapu ke gurde takreeban kaam karnaa band kar chuke the, tab kisi tarah kaa injection lenaa to dur baapu ne kisi bhi tarah kii dawaai lene se manaa kar diya tha
 How could Sardar Patel think of the man who had dedicated himself to God in such a way that it was better to listen to bhajans instead of medicine or surgery? By the way, Gandhi himself had given instructions before dying that his body should not be molested after his death
 sharir puja ke virdohi the gandhijipyarelal ji aage likhte hai, ‘ek suzav yah diya gaya ki gandhiji ke sharir ko masaale main rakhkar kam se kam kuch din tak darshan ke liye rakhaa jaae
 But i knew that Gandhiji was a staunch opponent of worshiping the body after death
 isliye maine hastkshep karnaa apana pavitra kartavya samajha
 i dr jivraj mehta ke kaan main kaha, ‘lekin yah to baapu kii ichha ke viruddh hoga
 'dr
 mehta ne mujhase kaha ki tab to yah baat aapako in logon ko bataani chahie
 Saying this, he pushed me forward
 maine lord mountbeton ko sambodhan karke kaha, ‘manyavar, aapako yah bataa dena meraa kartavya he ki shav masaale main rakhane kaa rivaaj gandhiji ko bahut naapnsad tha or unhone mujhe khaas taur par yah sthaayee aadesh de rakhaa tha ki unka sharir vahiin jala diya jaae jahaan unki mrityu ho
 'dr
 Jeevraj Mehta and Jairamdas Daulatram supported me
 ’mountbeton ne aage kaha, ‘agar gandhiji puri aayu jikar sammaan ke saath saadhaaran mrityu pate to yah baat bilkul thik hoti
 But don't you believe in view of the special situation? 
 
 ? itnaa kahkar ve ruk gaye or haath failaakar prashn kaa sanket kiya
 'I replied,' Gandhiji told me that even if i die, i will reprove you, if in this case you have missed your duty
 ’ pyarelal ji ko to gandhi ji kii taakid yaad rahi or ve ain maukey par apana kartavya karne se nahin chuke
 In this way they may have escaped Bapu's rebuke, but what did they know that Swamiji would give them a cry later
 patel ne RSS par sawaal khadey kiesansad main ek anya baat swami ne yah uthaai ki nehruji ko likhe patr main sardaar patel ne aresas ko gandhiji kii hatya ke dosha se mukt bataaya tha
 But Swamy did not say that in the same letter Patel had said that the RSS would certainly be put in the dock for the rest of its sins
 or swami jaanboojhkar iske pehle or baad likhe gaye patel ke ve patr bhul gaye jisamen gandhi ji kii hatya ke liye aresas ko doshi bataaya gaya
 Swamy turned the pages, he would get a letter from Sardar written by Shyamaprasad Mukherjee on 18 July 1948, in which Sardar clearly blamed the RSS for creating a situation that led to the murder of Bapu
 patel ne vir saavarkar ko gandhiji kii hatya kaa shadyantrkaari manasvami ne nehru ji ko likhe jis patr kaa hawala diya uske baad mukherjee or nehru ko likhe anya patron main patel ne baar-baar vir saavarkar ko gandhiji kii hatya kaa shadyantrakaari mana or mukherjee or golwalkar se saavarkar se dur rahane ko kaha
 But Swamiji is a member of the same party where people come in trend from RSS and worship Veer Savarkar
 yah swami hi bataaen ki saavarkar ke ek chele godse ne gandhi kii hatya kii thi or saavarkar ke vartmaan chele sangh ko hatyakand se clinit dene kii daleel de rahe hai

 The alleged saints and mahants have been accused of sexual harassment in the past
 is baar karnataka ke ek pujari raghaveshwar bharti swami aise hi aarope ke ghere main aa gaye hai
 It is a different matter that cases have also been registered against the accused
 karnataka ke shimoga jile main sthit shriramchandrapura math ke pujari raghaveshwar bharti ke khilaaf bengalooru police ne yon utpeedan kaa cese darj kiya he

 Anshumati Shastri's mother Premlata Diwakar is a singer who used to sing regularly on the occasion of cultural and religious celebrations of that monastery
 police ne dhara 354-A (yon utpeedan) or 506 (dhamkee dene) ke tahat maamla darj kiya he
 The most interesting aspect of the case is that as soon as Anshumati lodged a complaint with the police, the Uttara Kannada police arrested her parents
 darasal, math ke karmchaariyon ne bhi shikaayat darj karwaai thi ki yah danpati pujari ko blackmel karne kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Premlata and her husband were produced in court
 court ne shanivaar tak danpati ko nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya
 The whole affair came to light when on Monday, some employees of the monastery alleged that Premlata and her husband were threatening other singers and musicians for not attending the 'ramkatha' program
 math ke do karmchaariyon ne premalata ke khilaaf alag-alag maamla darj karavaaya he
 a case was filed on 16 August in Bangalore, while on 17 August in Honnavara
 aarope lagaaya gaya he ki danpati ne anya kalakaaron ko dhamkee di he ki ve kaarykram main bhaag na len
 At the same time, he has also advised others to become part of the racket of 'ungahi'
 raghaveshwar bharti saal 2010 main tab charchaa main aae the, jab mangalore main 3 yuvakon kii giraftaar hui thi

 The couple is accused of continuously tarnishing the monastery's image
 un par pujari se 3 karod rupee dhamkiyaan dekar, nazaij tareeke se ugaahi karne kaa aarope he
 On the other hand, Anshumati alleges that her parents tried to register a case against the priest on several occasions, but each time the staff of the monastery stopped her from doing so

 ramlila maidan main jagah-jagah lage 24 foot oonche narendra modi ke cat outs, modi
 
 modi ke naare lagaataa kareeb 40 hazaar logon kaa hujum or manch par maujuud teen mukhyamantri or chaar cabinet mantriyon se mili jananaayak ke tamge se las narendra modi
 How many BJP leaders from Satish Upadhyay to mps and unknown bjp's eyes turned to Narendra Modi, as if a gesture of his would prove to be the edge of the political kayak of these leaders
 ramlila maidan main modi ke cat out ke saamne bijepi ke duusare netaaon ke postaron kii gaiyrhaaziri sanket de rahi he ki dilli ke chunaav kii captaini narendra modi hi karenge
 Delhi BJP leaders intend to hold 12 such rallies
 hamaare jaise reporter jo dilli ke chunaav main beete das saal se shila dikshit kaa dabadabaa dekhte aae hai, unke liye dilli vidhansabha chunaav main narendra modi kii sidhi dakhal ajeeb lagati he
 Perhaps his projection is also a result of lack of leaders like Madanlal Khurana in Delhi BJP
 dilli main chunaav kaa khel shuru ho chukaa he, ek taraf narendra modi kii viraat dikh rahi raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon kii fouj he
 On the other hand, Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party, who stood up after a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections
 kejariwal ke saath is baar jhuggi-jhopadiyon ke saath musalmaan voter bhi jud gaye
 Due to this, their self-confidence has increased significantly
 vahiin modi middle class kii pasand abhi bhi bane hue hai
 Before the rally started at Ramlila Maidan, the BJP leaders of Delhi were expecting a big announcement, but even after searching for me in the quiver of Modi's speech which lasted about an hour, i could not find any Brahmastra that could defeat Kejriwal
 udhar kejariwal kii raajnneetik haisiyat puri tarah dilli vidhansabha chunaav par tiki he
 Due to this, he is promising to free him from water to electricity
 49 din ke karpshan free maahaul ko uplabdhi bataakar vah philhal vidhansabha chunaav main majbootee se khadey dikh rahe hai
 However, in this political package being given by the BJP to the people of Delhi, the verses of the simplicity of the three Chief Ministers were read, through which the BJP has tried to break the politics of the common man
 lekin bijepi ne dilli main bhi narendra modi ke chehre par daanv lagaaya he
 The stakes are big, so Modi's strategists are working hard day and night, but he does not seem confident
 baharhaal chunaav ek maheenaa baad hona he or dekhnaa he ki is tarah kii raily se narendra modi apane raajnneetik haisiyat ko kis tarah ajey banaate hai

 This order has been given by the court on the petition filed on behalf of shooter Vartika Singh
 adaalat ne is maamle main police ko exiaar darj karne or 3 din main jaanch report bhi pesh karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The shooter Vartika Singh had filed a petition seeking to order Iqbal Ansari to file a case on sedition and other charges, which has been accepted by the court
 aaropon ke mutabik 3 sitambar ko vartika singh ram mandir mudde par ikbaal ansaari se baat karne unke ghar gai thi
 During this, Iqbal Ansari accused Vartika of scuffling and filed a case against him, which is still under investigation
 PM ko apshabd kehane kaa aaropaphir vartika singh ne aarope lagaaya ki ikbaal ansaari ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or siem yogi adityanath ko apshabd kahe
 Vartika Singh had made these allegations at a press conference and she also said that after visiting Shri Ram Janmabhoomi, she had come to meet Iqbal Ansari at the behest of a person
 lekin ikbaal ansaari ne kaha ki vahaan par ram mandir kabhi nahin banegaa
 Iqbal Ansari said very well about Ram temple and Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 jiske aadhaar par shikaayat kii gai he or ab mukadmaa darj karne kaa aadesh hua he
 On the other hand, Iqbal Ansari termed the entire case as fake and fabricated, and said that Vartika Singh is taking this action under revenge and is trying to write a false case against him
 unhone ram mandir yaa babari masjid ke bare main pradhanmantri narendra modi or yogi adityanath ke bare main kabhi bhi koi bhi apshabd nahin kaha
 All this is being tried to trap them
 unhone 15 saal alag-alag jelon main bitaye hai

 unki saat surgery ho chuki hai, jisamen mumbai ke tata memorial hospital main carcinoma (ek prakaar kaa cancer) kii do surgery bhi shaamil hai
 At the age of 81, Syed Ali Shah Geelani has finally fulfilled his dream - to lead anti-india sentiments in the Kashmir Valley
 taharik-e-hurriyat ke chairman or jamaat-e-islamic ke lambey samay se sadsy gilaani is baar chupchaap baaji chhodane ke mood main najar nahin aate
 Of course it would be surprising for them that even 'revolutionaries' like Arundhati Roy are willing to support their demand to separate Kashmir from India
 hadtaal ke chaar maheene baad, jisamen 111 yuvak-yuvatiyaan maare gaye, 1,025 giraftaar or 3,500 ghayal hue, gilaani kaa maananaa he ki ve kashmir main islamic shashan sthapit karne kaa chamatkaar karne ke kagaar par hai
 Of course it may seem a distant dream now, but it has been the main focus of his life since joining the jamaat-e-islami in 1953
 us samay ve sarkari skool main adhyaaapak hua karte the, or ve 1940 se 1944 tak chaar saal lahore main guzaar kar quran or dharamshastra kii shiksha le chuke the
 He did not return to Pakistan after 1944, although his 47-year-old elder son Naeem has been living in Pakistan for the last ten years
 mjedaar tathy yah he ki ek aisa shaks jo bharat kii akhandta ko bhang karnaa chahta he, jo dharmanirpeksh bharat ke vichaar se nafrat karata he, use dilli or srinagar sarkaar se vittiya madad lene se koi gurej nahin he
 There are also reports that they also receive money from the Intelligence Secret Fund
 lekin jis baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa vah yah he ki unki surjariyon ke liye sarkaar ne bhugtan kiye, or jammu-kashmir ke purv mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said ne to unhen ranchi kii jail se laane ke liye vishesh vimaan tak bheja tha
 He was kept in this prison
 unke pesamekar ko escorts aspataal main badla gaya, unka pittashay gangaaraam aspataal main nikaala gaya,unke motiyobind ke do oparation apollo aspataal main hue
 Moreover, his teeth were redesigned at Batra Hospital
 yah sab desh kii rajdhani main hua
 His surgery at Tata Memorial Hospital was so successful that the part of the right kidney that was left and has started functioning again, is working on both kidneys
 srinagar ke haidarpura ilaake main unka teen manjila shandaar or aaramdaayak ghar unhen jamaat-e-islamic ne uplabdh karaayaa he
 He has also built a house in Delhi's Malviya Nagar where he spends three months of Kashmir's winter
 lekin ve aazaadee kii maang ko lekar adig rahete hai, jo unki najar main kashmir ko pakistan ke saath jod degi
 They do not want Azad Kashmir, although independence would be credited with "indian imperialism"
 vah us vichaardhaara ke samarthak hai jo majahabi pakistan ke tahat kashmir ko islamic rajya bananaa chaahati he
 Sajjad Lone, a pro-independence supporter who is one of his staunch critics, believes that the Indian government will prefer to pursue Geelani so as to discredit the secular, freedom movement in its original form
 ''yah shashan kii kala he
 As long as they stay here, independence will continue to be a dangerous idea for Kashmiris
 '' gilaani islamickaran ke liye apana abhiyaan pehle hi ched chuke hai
 He is speaking openly about how the Kashmiri youth should be saved from Indianisation through "delhi's public schools and army schools
" '' shaayad tabhi deepies srinagar ke adhyaksh vijay dhar ko jamaat ke logon ne shuukravaar kii namaaj ke liye bacchon ko chuttee dene ke liye kaha tha or islamic uniwarsity of science and technology ke vaais chancelar siddiq vaahid ko campus main masjid banane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 But both these demands were rejected outright
 jis tarah garmiyon main yuva sadakon par utre, gilaani uskaa shrey lene ke liye aatur najar aate hai
 They say that the fear of death among these youth is "unique" and "worthwhile"
 unki prerana kaa strot? ve kehete hai, ''jab bhi ham reliyon, seminaron yaa masjidon main yuvaaon se baat karte hai, to main kahata hum ki prerana kaa strot quran or sunnah he
 "the results have started coming
" unka kahana he, ''jo jaagrukta fail rahi he uske liye hamen 1947 main shuru kiye gaye jamaat ke skulon or taiyaar kiye gaye sahitya kaa abhaari hona chahie
 It was this atmosphere that forced Kashmiri Pandit and scholar Shashi Shekhar Toshkhani to leave Srinagar in 1984
 ''gilaani is vichaar ke pratik hai ki islam kis tarah kafiron par takat kii aajamaaish karata he
 It is this view that invited the greatest tragedy of independent India, the genocide of Kashmiri Pandits cannot be forgotten
 '' kai yuva kashmiri muslimon ke liye gilaani ek lok nayak kii tarah hai, libian umr mukhtaar kii tarah jinhone libya main italy ke aadhipaty ke khilaaf jang ladi thi or kabhi samjhauta nahin kiya
 This is something that Mirwaiz Umar Farooq also believes
 ve kehete hai, ''jab-jab kashmir ne nai dilli ke saath baatcheet kii he, chaahe vah 1947, 1953 yaa 1975 ho, iske netaa hameshaa apekshaakrit zyada nahin balki kam swaittata ke saath laute hai
 "he points to Delhi's ouster from Pervez Musharraf's three-stage conversation about the four-point formula
" gilaani is kavayad kaa hissaa nahin the, haalanki 2005 main ve musharraf se mili the
 Despite changing Pakistan's stance during Musharraf's time, Geelani refused to relent on the issue of independence, which further spread his aura among the youth
 hameshaa se unka rukh rahaa haih jammu-kashmir ko vivaadaaspad kshetra ghoshit karo, yahaan se sena hataao, sabhi ''sakht kanoonon'' ko hataao, sabhi raajnneetik kaidiyon ko reeha karo or vaarta ko tripaksheeya banaao
 Lone's way of thinking is something else: "they only want talks when they are only with them, not with anyone else
" ''lone ke paas khinn hone ke kaaran hai
 Gilani accused Lone of betraying the movement when he indirectly contested the 2002 assembly election and was forced out of the 26-party strong Hurriyat Conference
 lekin gilaani khud bhi chunaav lard chuke hai
 He even participated in the 1980 parliamentary election, he was a Muslim United Front candidate from Baramulla
 ve teen baar-1972, 1977 or 1987 main- vidhayak bhi rah chuke hai
