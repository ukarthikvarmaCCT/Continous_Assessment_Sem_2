 The BJP won a total of 49 assembly seats in 2013 led by Raman Singh
 jabaki congress sirf 39 siten hi jeet pai thi
 While 2 seats went to others

 Raman Singh is the Chief Minister of the state since 2003
 ek baar phir bastar main jan-jivan thap ho gaya, maovadiyon kaa khauf ek baar phir yahaan kii janata ke sir chadh kar bolaa
 The Maavodis had announced the India bandh on 5 and 6 December to protest against their top Maoist leader Kishenji being killed in an alleged fake encounter
 maovadi band pehle bhi hue hai lekin is baar bastar ke janajivan par iskaa khaasaa asar dekhne ko mila
 In fact, the Maoists also celebrate their PLGA (people's Liberation Guerrilla Army) Establishment Week from 2 to 8 December and due to its fall during this two-day bandh, the Maoists created a fierce situation this time
 jiske kaaran do rashtriya rajmargon par yatayaat buree tarah prabhavit hua
 During the bandh, the Maoists declared two informants brutally murdered, attacked the house of a paramilitary armed force man, and looted a lot of loot and issued leaflets everywhere, warning to intensify the civil war
 dehshat ke in teen dinon main bastar ke log puri tarah se maovadiyon ke rahamokaram par dikhe
 Not only this, the government was also in awe of the Maoists, only then the passenger train on the visakhapatnam-kirandul route was run to Koraput (odisha) while the goods trains were not run at night as a precaution
 andruni ilaakon main sadak maarg par yatayaat puri tarah thap rahaa or saptahik haat-bazaar bhi suune pade rahe
 Maoists also damaged National Highway number 30
 4 disambar kii shaam kareeb saat baje jagadalpur se 40 kimi dur darabha ghati main 300 graminon ko lekar pahunche kareeb 100 hathiyaarband maovadiyon ne, jinamein badi sankhya main mahilaayein bhi thi, paanch sthanon par gaharava gadde khod die or sadak kaat daali, kai jagahon par ped katkar daal die
 While the Director General of Police Anil Navani was on Bastar stay on this day
 ghatnasthal se thana mahaj teen kimi kii duuri par he lekin maovadiyon main police kaa kori khauf najar nahin aayaa
 He took the keys of his vehicle, regretting the drivers of the vehicles passing by, who also returned the next day
 chhavi sudhaarney kii koshish ke tarah unhone raste main fanse bhukhe logon ke liye bhojan kii vyavastha kii
 Traffic on this highway was restored after 72 hours
 is ghatana se pehle tak enech-30 par raipur se jagadalpur tak kaa safar surakshit mana jaataa tha
 Trains continued to run smoothly even at night
 ghatana ke agle hi din 5 disambar kii der shaam jagadalpur se 50 kimi dur gorna naala ke kareeb sadak par maovadiyon ne ek vishalkay darkht gira diya, jisase teen ghante tak avaagaman baadhit rahaa or kondagaanv se ghar aa rahe adivasee kalyaan mantri kedaar kashyap ko bhi waapas yaheen laut aana padaa
 The next day, barely 10 km from this place, the Maoists blasted a landmine near Baniagaon at 11 am and damaged the culvert
 visphot itnaa jabardast tha ki sadak par kareeb 5 meter gaharaa gaddha ho gaya
 This incident has given sleep to the people of Jagdalpur and Kondagaon, who are considered safe till now
 maovadiyon ne enech-63 ko bhi khaasaa nuksaan pahunchaaya
 Here, this highway was disrupted for a week due to road digging and felling of trees between Bijapur to Bhopalpatnam
 maovadiyon ne 5 disambar kii raat bailadila ilaake ke bhaansi or bacheli ke bich do jagah patari ukhaad di jisase malgadee kaa ingine patari se utar gaya or is treks par chaar ghant tak yatayaat baadhit rahaa
 In spite of all these incidents, this time the Maoists did not target the common people in large numbers as usual, but they certainly hurt the government
 yah bhi jataa diya ki is ilaake main unka hi sikaa chalata he

 Party president Amit Shah, who was under pressure from the rebellion of the elderly leaders of the party after the crushing defeat of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Bihar Assembly elections, was seen to be embroiled in another controversy

 aaj pashchim uttar pradesh ke un ilaakon main gaya, jinhen 'satha churaasi' kehete hai
 
 
 Actually, 'satha Chaurasi' is a group of 60 and 84 villages
 
 
 in gaanvon ko tomars or sisodiya rajputon kaa garh mana jaataa he
 
 
 Tomar and Sisodia Rajputs are Hindus as well as Muslims, but even after separation of religion, the ethnic relations of the two are amazing
 
 
 tomars rajputon kii pagadi muslim tomars ke gaanv se aati he, jise hindu rajput apana choudhary maanate hai
 
 
 Similarly, the turban of Sisodia Rajputs also comes from Muslim Sisodia village
 
 
 muslim naamon ke ant main rana, sisodiya or tomars naam saamaanya hote hai
 
 
 Tomar Mahmood Ali Khan of this region has also been the Governor of Madhya Pradesh
 
 
 choudhary charan singh ke jamaane tak muslim rajputon kaa raajnneetik pratinidhitiv thik-thaak rahaa, magar baad main kam hota chalaa gaya
 
 
 'satha Chaurasi', ie Rajputs of 144 villages, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahar and Hapur influence parliamentary seats, but they have more grip on Ghaziabad
 
 
 is ilaake main rajputon ke gaanv 32, 60 or 84 gaanvon ke samooh main paae jate hai
 
 
 a gentleman said that there is no such strip of Rajputs in the whole of Uttar Pradesh

 'though this is just a statement on this issue, but it is certain that with this open support of Aishwarya, he will certainly be very surprised with the supporters of Sallu Mian but at the same time he will be happy with this support

 salmaan ko bollywood kaa phool saportbollywood salmaan khan ko gudwil ambassador banaae jane kaa puraa samarthan kar rahaa he
 Bollywood actor and MP Kiran Kher said during the 'dada Saheb Phalke Excellence' award ceremony, 'it is a very good decision
 mujhe salmaan khan par kaaphi garv he
 Whatever people are saying that only one player should be made a goodwill ambassador, i would like to stay away from them

 Any iconic personality who inspires us can become a brand ambassador

 Be a good hearted person and pay respect to Salman as well

 vah hameshaa se hi khel premi rahe hai or acha cricket, footbal khelte hai or saath hi ek achche cyclist hai

 ' sankat main fanse ipel ke nilambit kamishnar lalit modi ko aaj apane pita se bhaavnaatmak sahaara mila or aarthik sambal kii peshkash bhi
 Contrary to the perceived strained relationship between the son and father, industrialist father KK Modi spoke of supporting his son Lalit and offered financial help
 saath hi unene kaha ki maujuuda pareshaaniyaan anapekshit nahin hai lekin lalit halaat se bhaage nahin
 75-year-old KK Modi's Rs 4,000-crore business spans from tobacco to entertainment
 unhone pitiai se phone par bataaya, maine use istipha nahin dene ke liye esemes kiya tha
 i told him that you are surrounded by problems but the whole family is with you and you will deal with them

 unhone kaha,agar lalit modi group ke liye frenchiji company bananaa chahen to main unhen usase bhi zyada paisa dene kaa icchhuk hum jitna bisisiai ne ipel shuru karne ke liye diya tha
 If he (: Lalit) makes a venture with half the success from the IPL, then every member of the Modi family will benefit
 pita modi ne unke bete ke istipha dene kaa matlab hota ki usne gadabadi kii he
 He claims that his son did nothing wrong
 modi parivaar ke mukhiya ne kaha,uske paas apana bachaav karne ke liye shat pratishat he
 Such problems are not unexpected
 agar aap ipel jaisi khel pratiyogita chalaa rahe hon to log sawaal karenge hi
 Lalit Modi deposited Rs 11 crore as advance tax in 2009-10, whereas in the previous year this amount was only a few lakh rupees
 lalit ko vilasitapurna jivan style ke liye janaa jaataa he or rapaton ke anusaar unke paas nijee vimaan, pot, mahangi kaaren, haweliyaan
 And do not know what is
 haalanki ke ke modi ne kaha ki lalit kii jivan style koi ipel par nirbhar nahin he
 i believe most of the allegations are on his lifestyle
 uski jivan style koi ipel par nirbhar thode hi he
 At the same time, he believes that Lalit has learned a lot from the IPL and has learned the tricks of business which can be useful for the Modi group
 modi ne kaha,ab tak hamen usase keval ipel se mili prasiddhi kaa hi laabh mila lekin ab mujhe vishwaas he ki hamen uski (lalit kii) kaarobaari visheshaitaaon kaa phayda milegaa

 america sena ne dharmik saamanjasy ke apane tarah ke anuthe maamle main ladaai ke morche par tainaat ek sikh faujee captain ko dadhi rakhane or pagadi pahanane kii philhal ijaajat de di he
 It is being said that this case can hold great importance in the case of soldiers who want to serve the army with their religious identity
 neuyark times kii report ke mutabik, captain simrat paal singh ko 10 saal pehle america sainya academy main pehle din apane kesh or dadhi ke bal katwane pade the
 The reason was that no soldier is allowed to have long hair and beard in the US Army
 lekin, beete hafte captain singh ke liye tasviir badal gai
 The army allowed him to grow a beard and tie his hair in a turban
 neuyark times ke mutabik, branj star award se sammanit kiye ja chuke captain singh ne kaha, 'yah adbhut he
 i was living a double life
 ghar par hi pagadi pahentaa tha
 Singh said, 'my two worlds have finally come together
 ' The newspaper has reported that this is the first case in decades of recognizing religious faith, when a soldier posted on the war front is allowed to shave
 isse musalamaanon or anya samudaayon ko apni dharmik aasthaa ke hisaab se chhot milane kii ummid jaagi he
 However, this rebate has been given for just one month

 According to a New York Times report, Captain Simrat Pal Singh had to get his hairstyle and beard haircut on the first day at the US Military Academy 10 years ago
 vajah yah thi ki america sena main kisi bhi sainik ko lambey bal or dadhi rakhane kii ijaajat nahin he
 However, the picture changed for Captain Singh last week
 sena ne unhen dadhi badhaane or kesh ko pagadi main baandhne kii ijaajat de di
 According to the New York Times, Captain Singh, who has been awarded the Bronze Star Award, said, "it's amazing
 main dohari jindagi ji rahaa tha
 Used to wear a turban at home
 ' singh ne kaha, 'meri do duniya aakhirkaar ek saath aa gai
 ' akhbaar ne bataaya he ki dharmik aasthaa ko manyata dene kaa yah dashakon main pehla maamla he, jab jang ke morche par tainaat sainik ko dadhi rakhane kii chhot di gai he
 With this, Muslims and other communities are expected to get an exemption according to their religious faith
 lekin, yah chhot abhi sirf ek maheene ke liye di gai he
 After this, the army will decide whether the temporary exemption given to Singh should be made permanent
 vahiin singh ne neuyork times se kaha ki agar yah suvidha sthai nahin kii gai to vah mukadmaa daayar karne ke liye taiyaar hai

 After his statement, a nationwide uproar started
 ek bijepi netaa ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki ram jethmalani ko apana naam badalakar ravan jethmalani rakh lenaa chahie
 The letter bashing the party is the reason for the recent action on PM Kojethmalani, a letter and the statement given therein
 pichley saal november main jab upie sarkaar ne vipaksh ke aitraaj ke baavjood sibiai nideshak ke pad par ranjit sinha kii niyukti kii thi, tab bijepi ke donon sadanon main netaa, sushamaa swaraj or arun jetali ne piem ko aitraaj jataate hue khat likhaa tha
 When Jethmalani came to know of this, he wrote a letter to party president Nitin Gadkari
 isaki prati piem or media ko bhi bheji gai
 He said that i was taken aback by this attack on the party's Prime Minister and Congress
 mujhe niraashaa ho rahi he ki is tarah kii aalochana kai tathyon kii bhayanak andekhi kar kii gai he
 Not even the Supreme Court, Ram Jethmalani had lobbied for some time in the ongoing case against Bakhsanjaya Dutt

 But i do not think that the Supreme Court should have done what it ordered in this case

 rizvi ne kaha he ki unke khilaaf maahaul kharaab kiya ja rahaa he or maravane kii sajeesh kii ja rahi he
 Wasim Rizvi, who is in the news for his statements in support of the construction of the Ram temple, said on Sunday that the Mullahs, who are part of the Babarikalank, are plotting to kill him through mob-lynching by spoiling the atmosphere against them
 unhone daawa kiya ki ayodhya ram kii nagari he or babari dhaancha mandiron ko todakar banaaya gaya tha
 Hence Babri is like a stigma on the holy land of India
 rizvi ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki ayodhya kii puri pavitra jameen ram kii nagari he, hinduon kaa tirth sthaan he or jis sthaan par babari dhaancha mandiron ko todakar banaaya gaya tha, vah shriram kaa janm sthaan he
 The Mughals have always built mosques at the pilgrimage centers of Hindus by breaking the important temples associated with the Gods of Hindus
 rizvi ne ye bhi kaha ki kattarpanthi sunni samaaj ke wahabi samarthak mullah iesas aatanki abu bakar par die unke bayaan ko apane khalipha se jodakar unke (rizvi) viruddh dharmik unmaad paidaa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 There is a conspiracy behind this to spoil the moharam of Shia society
 unhone kaha ki aatanki abu bakar bagdadi or mullah umr hindustan main rahane vaale musalamaanon ke khalipha nahin hai or agar koi inako khalipha maanakar inaki vichaardhaara par chalata he, to use bhi is desh main aatankiyon kii hi shrenee main mana jayega
 He said that in reality all these are advocates of Babri structure
 yah hindustan main ek kalank kii tarah he, jo hindustan ke musalamaanon ko ek din barbaad kar saktaa he

 If they praise the work, then there is satisfaction and the resolve awakens that further good work has to be done
 aisa kyon he ki aap charchaaon se kaaphi dur rahete hai
 Looking at the figures of Madhya Pradesh, the growth rate is far ahead, yet no one knows much about it? Gradually everyone will know because when work is done, it does not hide, one day it is recognized

 No, they are national leaders

 balangir ke sambhageeya van adhikari (DFO) samir satpathi ne kaha ki purv anumati liye bina asthaayee helipad taiyaar karne ke liye jile main railway stesan ground ke nikat kai ped kaate gaye hai

 1 of these to make a helipad
 25 hectare jameen ke pedo ko kaata gaya he
 Accordingly, permission is to be taken from the railway before cutting these trees, but nothing like this was done here

 In this case, the Railways says that it was necessary to cut trees immediately from the point of view of the Prime Minister's safety
 isliye aisa kiya gaya

 com / xanzcuox4x— ayushmannbhava (@ayushmannbhava)july 3, 2019is film kaa nirdesan anubhav sinha ne kiya he
 With the release of the trailer, the film was opposed
 kuch brahman sanghathanon ne aarope lagaaya tha ki film main brahmanon kii chhavi ko dhoomil kiya gaya he
 During this, director Anubhav and his family were even threatened with death
 iske baad unhone apane twitor acount par film kaa virodh karne waalon ke liye ek open letters likhaa tha
 He had said through a letter that through this letter, i also forgive all the members of AAP who violated the limits of disagreement and protest
 meri hatya yaa meri bahanon or meri divangat maa ke balaatkaar kii dhamkiyon se samvaad nahin ho saktaa
 First of all, let me explain to you that the trailer of any film cannot tell its full story
 uttar pradesh main fatehpur jile (fatehpur District) main husainganj thana kshetra ke ek gaanv main shanivaar ko 'unnav cond' (unnao Rape Case) doharaaya gaya
 Here in the afternoon, an 18-year-old girl was raped by her uncle in the house, then sprayed kerosene oil and set her on fire
 nabbe fisadi jal chuki ladki ko kanpur ke aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 Fatehpur Municipal Deputy Superintendent of Police (CO) Kapil Dev Mishra said that the 18-year-old girl was alone in her house on Saturday afternoon in a village in the Hussenganj police station area
 parivaar ke anya sadsy kheton main kaam kar rahe the
 At the same time, the 22-year-old uncle of his relationship entered the house and raped the girl and angered by the complaint of the girl, sprinkled kerosene oil on her and set her on fire
 yah bhi padhein- nirbhaya cese kaa ek maah main ho nipataara, yachika main supreme court se faansee ke live prasaaran kii mangamishra ne bataaya ki aag kii lapaton se ghiri ladki kii cheekh sunakar gaanv waalon ne kisi tarah aag bujhaai or police ko soochna di
 He told that the girl has burnt 90 percent
 pehle use sthaneey saamudayik swasthya centre le jaaya gaya
 From there, he was admitted to a hospital in Kanpur after first aid
 sio ne bataaya ki ladki ke pita kii taharir par aaropee yuvak ke khilaaf balaatkaar or hatya kii koshish kaa mukadmaa darj kar liya gaya he or uski giraftaar ke liye police kii timen dabish de rahi hai
 Also read- Nirbhaya's mother filed an intervention petition in the SC, saying- Mishra, who is escaping the sentence by playing a guilty legal wager, cited the findings of the investigation so far that the victim and the accused youth were reported to have a love affair
 donon pakshon ke bich shuukravaar ko panchayat hone kii baat bhi saamne ai he, jisamen donon pakshon ke bich shaadi ke liye sahmati bani
 He said that after all this, the incident of rape and burning of the victim is beyond comprehension
 navazuddin siddiki kisi pahchaan ke mohataaj nahin rah gaye hai
 Born on 19 May 1974, Nawazuddin is a great actor but at the same time he takes inspiration on many levels for his roles
 phir chaahe gangs of vasepur ke liye rasukhdaar jameendaaron se prerana leni ho yaa phir kik main apni khatarnaak hansi ke liye manoj vaajapei kaa style copy karnaa ho
 Nawaz uses every means to make his character perfect but due to this many times he gets some kind of tragedy which he hardly expected
 film companian se baat karte hue navazuddin ne film lanchbox ke apane kairactor ke bare main baat kii
 He told 'I have a friend who is an actor
 ham kuch samay tak saath main bhi rahe the
 He also used to share his personal troubles with me
 main kahin naa kahin is film main uski tarah baat kar rahaa tha
 He had seen the film and thanked me
 lekin mere is role ke baad use kaam milanaa band ho gaya tha
 If he had gone to audition anywhere, he would have said that Nawazuddin has already done a character with this character and such accent
 wo bolta tha ki ham to original main hi aise hai, unhone mujhe copy kiya tha
 So he was a bit upset in that affair
 wo mujhe jahaan bhi miltaa he, gaaliyaan detaa he ki tuune meri roji roti par laat maar di
 Used to say such things
 'view this post on instagrami'm overwhelmed and extremely grateful to each one of you for making Thackeray a success

 The same happened with this scene and this is one of my favorite shots

 My expressions did not move at all, if that were the case, the main work of my character would have ended

 tii-20 gendbaajon kii suchi main koi bhi bhartiya shaamil nahin he
 
 
 And among all-rounders too, Yuvraj Singh is the only Indian player, and is at number four

 co / vdfcaq2yjg On Tuesday, former Delhi Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Sheila Dikshit denied any alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party
 unhone yah baat congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se milane ke baad kahi he

 vahiin duusare formula ke tahat aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki agar dilli main congress ko zyada siten chahie to use punjab, haryana jaise rajyon main seat dekar isaki bharpai kerani hogi

 general nolej ke section ko 15 minute, english ke section ke liye 20 minute, quantetitive aptitude ke liye 8-20 minute or rianning ko hal karne ke liye 35 minute kaa time len
 2
 sabase pehle us section ko dekhen jisamen aap kaaphi comfortable hai
 But keep in mind that do not answer the questions with a ruckus
 3
 Practice as many question papers and mock tests as possible, online tests
 aap jitani practice karenge utana hi aapmen aatmavishvaas aayega
 4
 maths ke sawaalon ko hal karne ke liye tikrs or short cat, mamori mathed jaise tareeke aajamaa sakate hai
 5
 eegzam kii taiyaari karne se pehle sawaalon kaa pattern jarur dekh len
 You can get the idea of patterns from many books
 ek baar aapako sawaalon kaa pattern samaj main aa jayega to apni taiyaari usee disha main karke achche marks score kar sakate hai
 6
 is exam main resho, aayat, ausat, proffit los, algebra or tignomentry ke sawaal aate hai
 But to solve them, your basic must be clear
 tabhi aap sawaalon ko hal karne main apni speed tej kar sakate hai
 7
 agar aapane yah samaj liya he ki kitna samay kis topic par dena he to uske baad aap un topics se jude sawaalon ko lagaataar hal karen
 This will increase your understanding of that subject
 8
 To study topics properly, it is important that you make notes related to it
 nots kii madad se aap silebus ko ek najar main riviz kar sakate hai
 9
 exam main kai aise sawaal aate hai, jo zyada samay le lete hai
 If you feel that you are not able to solve a question, then immediately come out of that question and start solving another question
 aisa karne se aap samay us sawaal main kharch nahin hoga or aap itane samay main kisi or sawaal ko hal kar lenge
 10
 exam main adhiktar students galat jawaab dete hai yaa phir sawaal ko khaali chhod dete hai
 Your focus should be on passing the exam by giving the correct answer as much as possible

 jisamen sirf aise log hon jinase baat karke or jinke saath rahakar khushi mili
 Those who are in happiness as well as in misery
 4
 Before the divorce, she used to blame herself for every big thing
 sochati thi ki ye jo kuch bhi ho rahaa he usamen uski hi galati he lekin talaak ke baad ye samaj aayaa ki galati kisi ek kii ho hi nahin sakati
 5
 talaak ke baad ye samaj aayaa kijis rishte se takalif mili,usase judi sari yaadon ko mitaa dena chahie
 Adopting this, she deleted everything related to her husband such as wedding photographs, video memory, digital memory
 6
 Gave up cursing himself
 apni galati maan lenaa acchhee baat he lekin duusare kii galati ko nazarandaaj karke khud ko doshi maananaa galat he
 7
 khud ke liye hameshaa samay hona chahie
 After marriage, we girls forget ourselves completely
 par ye galat he kyonki isse hamaara hi nuksaan hota he
 8
 koi rahe chaahe na rahe, ham khush rahanaa to nahin chhod sakate or khush rahanaa hamaara haq he
 No one can snatch it from us
 9
 Quit running from things and situations
 paristhitiyon se bhagkar ham sirf or sirf apana hi nuksaan karte hai
 10
 sabase khaas baat, talaak hi to hua he or ise pratishtha se jodakar dekhnaa galat he

 haal ke uttar pradesh ke chunavi natizon ke baad EVM yani electronic voting mashin kii gadabadi ko lekar raajnneeti garmai or bayaanbazi kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya he
 In a large democracy like India, there is a conspiracy to disturb the vote count, but how right is it to send this country moving towards Digital India back to the ballot box for votes? Experts also do not rule out the possibility of EVM tampering
 sibar export pawan duggal kaa kahana he, 'voting ke liye istemaal kii jane vaali ye mashine internet se connected nahi hotin, lihaaja isamen kisi sibar krime kii koi tarkeeb kaam nahi karegi, lekin isamen gadabadi kii sambhaavna ko nakaara nahi ja saktaa
 This machine can be disturbed by the combination of security personnel
 'pawan duggal bataate hai, 'EVM ek tarah ke computer hi hai or counting ke dauraan yaa pehle iske logaridam yaa maikenism ko chhedaa ja saktaa hai
 Talking about the safety of evms, they are standalone machines
 matlab isamen chhedchhad karne ke liye ek-ek mashin se chhedchhad kerani padegi
 In view of its security, it is not connected to any network and hence the scope of tampering in every machine is eliminated, but still the security of the machine can be compromised
 'unhone kaha, 'abhi tak bharat main safal taur par chal rahi ye voting mashin surakshit he, lekin phir bhi sibar suraksha niti ke maddenjar isaki suraksha paraton par dobaaraa vichaar karne main koi buraai nahi he
 He said that if the voting machine of an advanced country like America has been tampered with, then a fast growing democracy like India should try to prevent such disturbances
 atah zaruri hai ki EVM jaisi ahm digital mashin kii suraksha ko dobaaraa jaanch liya jaae

 com / smkisw5hiu — Office of RG (@officeofrg) January 5, 2018 There was a lot of controversy over pictures of Rahul Gandhi's meeting with the Chinese ambassador during the Doklam standoff last year
 soshal media par kuch aisi tasviren saamne ai thim jisamen rahul gandhi, unki bahan priyanka gadhi or jija robert wadra chini rajdoot ke saath najar aa rahe the
 The BJP accused Rahul of holding a meeting without any knowledge based on these photos
 piem modi ne himachal pradesh main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi rahul par doklam gatirodh ke bich hui is mulaakaat ko mudda banaaya tha
 However, the Congress clarified that Rahul's meeting was a courtesy call
 congress ne safai main kaha tha ki rahul ne sirf chini rajdoot nahin balki bhutan ke rajdoot or purv enese shivashankar menon se mili the, jo ki ek shishtachar mulaakaat kii thi
 In the Rajya Sabha, BSP supremo Mayawati raised the issue of Saharanpur on Tuesday
 unhone kaha ki saharanpur ghatana centre kii sajeesh thi
 After this there was a ruckus and Mayawati told the Deputy Chairman that if you do not let me speak then i resign from the House
 iske baad mayawati ne patrakaron se kaha ki unhone istipha de diya he
 At the same time, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that Mayawati is talking purely political
 iske baad mayawati gusse main sadan se baahar chali gayi
 After this, many opposition leaders created a ruckus
 aaj ke din sansad main donon hi pakshon ke log uparashtrapati pad ke liye apane-apane ummidavaar kaa nomination file kar rahe hai
 So through this uproar, the opposition is once again showing its solidarity

 It is noteworthy that the Congress party has given a stay on the issue of killing people by mob and firing on farmers by police in Mandsaur

 Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the situation in Sikkim is very tense with the border with China
 unhone saath hi seemaa vivaad ke liye china ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 Comments Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has said that we will raise issues of agrarian crisis in view of mob violence, farmer suicides
 aaazaad ne kaha ki congress sadan kii kaarywahi main vyavdhaan daalane ke paksh main nahin he, lekin unhone sarkaar se aage aakar muddon par charchaa karne kii anumati dene ko kaha
 On Monday, a day before the session, the Congress said that it will seek answers from the government on the issues of border dispute with China, tense situation in Kashmir and mob violence in the name of cow protection

 bijepi ne somvaar ko apana menifesto jari kar diya
 Some issues related to Hindus are also mentioned in this manifesto
 vishwa hindu parishad ke antarrashtriya karyaadhyaksh dow
 Praveen Togadia reacted to this and said that this is a very good thing
 togadiya ke mutabik, 'ye acchhee baat he ki hinduon ke, vishwa hindu parishad ke or anya hindu sanghathanon ke dwaara lagaataar majbootee se maang karne ke kaaran ab bijepi ke ghoshnaa patr main hinduon se jude kuch muddon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he
 Such as the temple of Lord Rama, Article 370, Uniform Civil Law, Kashmiri Pandit, gau-mata and Gauvansh protection etc
 'unhone ek press relies ke jariye apni pratikriya main likhaa, 'hinduon kii, vishwa hindu parishad kii or anya hindu sanghathanon kii yah apeksha he ki keval ghoshnaa patr main simit na rahete hue in sabhi muddon par samaybaddh reeti se nishchit kaary ho
 For example, Ram temple should be built by passing legislation in Parliament without wasting time for discussions on Ram temple in Ayodhya
 dhara 370 par charchaaen na chalaakar yah dhara turant hataai jaae
 Uniform civil law should be applicable in all the areas of the society without bringing uniform civil law only for the welfare of minority women
 'togadiya ke anusaar, 'kashmiri panditon kaa deergh pralambit punarwasan sammaan se or puri suraksha or aarthik sahyog dekar disambar 2014 tak unheen sthanon par ho jin sthanon se kashmir se unhen krurta se khadeda gaya tha
 The law of complete ban on cow slaughter and cow slaughter is passed in the Parliament immediately only then talk of cow development will have any meaning
 sabhi jati ke or vanavaasi garib hindu bacchon ko / mahilaon ko / yuvaaon ko rojgaar diya jaae
 Special laws should be enacted for the protection of Hindus / Hindu temples / pilgrimage areas and certain laws should be passed to prevent jihadi terrorism
 'dow
 Togadia further said, 'some demands of Hindus have been mentioned in this manifesto
 un sabhi par nishchit samay main kaary, yojana or amal ho, yah ab hinduon kii apeksha rahegi
 Now Hindus have to be awakened so that all mps fulfill this expectation

 The Bihar Congress is so afraid of the break up that it is ready to catch the feet of the mlas
 patna main bihar congress ke asthaayee adhyaksh kaukab kadri ne kaha ki jitne log aaj congress main he, unase apil karuunga ki wo party main hi rahen
 He said that if there is a need for this and will have to hold his leg too, then i will do that too
 bihar main mahagathbandhan ke bikharane ke baad se hi yah khabar aane lagi thi ki ab bihar congress main bhi tut ho sakati he
 Out of a total of 27 Congress mlas, 18 are ready for the break up
 bihar congress kii in khabaron se congress alaakaman ke kaan bhi khadey ho gaye
 Some legislators gave full information of the break to the high command
 bataaya gaya ki tut ke aguva or koi nahin congress ke tatkaaleen adhyaksh ashok choudhary hai
 After knowing about the case, the Alakaman started to investigate it
 iske baad se ashok choudhary alaakaman ke good book se bed book main chale gaye
 At the same time, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi called all the mlas of Bihar to Delhi
 do dinon main kul 27 main se 20 vidhayak rahul gandhi se milane dilli pahunche
 The most one-to-one conversation took place
 is bich kuch baaten chhanakar saamne ain
 The high command decided that Ashok Chaudhary should be removed from the post of president, but who would become the next president
 
 
 
 There was a situation of confusion about this
 is sthiti ko taalane ke liye congress alaakaman ne congress ke pradesh upaadhyaksh kadri ko asthaayee adhyaksh bana diya he
 It is difficult to say how many days Qadri will be president
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki wo is pad par do yaa chaar din hi rahen
 It is believed that Congress leader Akhilesh Singh can be made the next president
 ashok choudhary ne bhi kahaaki ek khaas vyakti ko adhyaksh banane ke liye yah asthaayee vyavastha kii gai he
 Ashok Chaudhary has been against Akhilesh Singh since the beginning
 halakicongress alaakamanayah jaanata he ki akhilesh singh ke adhyaksh banane se congress main tut kii ashanka yakeen main badal sakati he
 So he can consider some other names
 agar congress 2019 ko dhyaan main rakhkar ranneeti banaati he, to bihar pradesh congress adhyaksh ko senior bana sakati he yaa phir yuva congress ke adhyaksh ko mauka de sakati he
 Once in the state, Congress and once BJP have had a 'tradition' of forming a government
 uskaa hi asar loksabhaa chunaav par dikhataa he
 If we look at the results of the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan, it has been seen since 2004 that the party whose government is formed in the state gets more seats in the Lok Sabha elections
 jabaki aamtaur par rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav ke kareeb chah maheene baad hi loksabhaa chunaav hote hai
 In the 2003 assembly elections in the state, BJP got 120 seats and Congress got 58 seats
 iske baad 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main matadaataaon ne 25 main se 21 siten bhaajapa kii jholii main daal deen
 The Congress got four seats
 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pasa palat gaya
 The Congress got 96 seats in 200 and Ashok Gehlot formed the government
 basapa ke saare vidhayak congress main shaamil hone se congress ko bahumat mil gaya
 BJP got 76 seats in the assembly elections
 iske thik baad 2009 main loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko 20 va bhaajapa ko chaar siten milin
 Independent Kirodilal Meena was elected on one seat, who was then a supporter of Congress
 isi tarah 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko 163 siten milin or congress 21 siton par simat gayi
 The results of the Lok Sabha elections were even more shocking when the voters of the state gave the entire 25 seats to the BJP amid the Modi wave
 yah alag baat he ki pichley saal do siton par hue upachunaav main congress jeet gayi
 The Congress got 100 out of 200 seats in the state in the assembly elections held last December
 bhaajapa ke paas 73 siten hai
 However, the difference in the votes of the two parties is only about half a percent
 bhaajapa sutron ke anusaar, party ko ummid he ki is antar ko vah loksabhaa chunaav main badhane nahin degi or parampara ko todate hue acha pradarshan karegi
 The party's national president Amit Shah also expressed hope for it at his first event in Jaipur after the party's defeat in the assembly elections
 rajya main loksabhaa chunaav ke liye matdaan do charnon main 29 april or chah may ko hona he
 The Haryana School Education Board has made Aadhaar card mandatory for 10th and 12th grade students while applying for the 2017 examination

 ) Before you get into wrestling with Modi's farmer support and Rahul's minimum income guarantee, it is important to know that all the political parties of the country have recognized that the procession of government schemes required light in the lives of the poor of the country This is the reason why Modi government is giving Kisan Cash Assistance (rs
 6,000 per family per year to small marginal farmers) after the announcement of record crop support price
 Rs 6,000 Jbur occurred and Congress for the poor had to promise of income per month
 yah sawaal bemaani he ki is tarah kii scimen maujuuda sabsidi ke saath kaise lagu kii jaaengi? duniya se judaa bharat kaa swatantra vittiya bazaar kisi bhi netaa se zyada taqatvar he
 Governments cutting spending in the middle of the year due to deficit will have to change the mathematics of spending for such schemes, whether it is Modi's farmer assistance or Congress's income guarantee
 isliye, bahes ko aage badhaate hai
 Competitive politics has brought India to the threshold of such reforms which governments are afraid of discussing
 skiimon par kharch ke dhaanche main badlaav se sarkari vibhaagon kaa bhimkaay bhrashtachari dhaancha yani maximum government khatm kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the failure of the Income Guarantee debate, aka schemes, is extremely valuable, which if it reaches the conclusion, the biggest improvement could become a reality
 Both Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi have slipped
 sarkari skiimon kii bheed badhati gai or nattejey rahe sifer
 
 
 The Economic Review (2016-17) cites some samples — up to the last count, around 950 central schemes were playing in the center's budget lap, at a ratio of GDP (present value) of 5 per cent (about Rs 7 lakh crore)
 ) Has a budget allocation
 inamen 11 badi scimen (manaregaa, anaaj sabsidi, mid de mile, gram sadak, pradhanmantri awaas, fasal beemaa, svachh bharat, sarv shiksha aadi) sabase zyada aavanton hasil karti hai
 Some of the central government schemes are 15 years old and some 25 years old
 rajyon kii skiimon ko jodgaye ke baad sankhya bahut zyada ho jaati he
 - It is a chronic pain that the benefits of schemes do not reach the needy
 sarkaar kaa apana hisaab bataata he ki chah pramukh skiimon (awaas yojana, sarv shiksha, mid de mile, gram sadak, manaregaa, svachh bharat) ke sabase kam phaayde un jilon ko mili jahaan sabase zyada garib basate hai, jabaki jahaan garib kam the vahaan zyada sansaadhan pahunche
 —this is why about 40 percent of the targeted people do not get the benefit of the ration system and 65 percent of the needy MNREGA
 yahi haalat anya skiimon kii bhi he yani sidhi chori
 —the figures of the Modi government's latest schemes (ujjwala, Saubhagya) also testify to this
 agar siyaasi dal inakam guarantee kii himmat kar rahe hai to paanch badi sabsidi scimen band karne kii himmat dikhaaen
 1 of GDP only on petro and grain subsidies
 48 fisadi kharch hota he
 Doing so can open the way for direct funding to the hands of the people and the huge structure of government will be limited
 agar rajyon ko sansadhano ke aavanton ko bhi isse joda jaae or rajyon ke skim kharch ko simit kiya jaae to yah sudhaar kharch badhaane ke bajaae darasal bajtiy anushaasan lekar aayega
 The system of direct money transfer (DBT) to the people's account has been established
 bank khate main alpiji sabsidi kii safalataa sabase bada pramaan he
 Sufficient studies are available to support the argument that wealth in the hands of the people increases the demand in the economy, with minimum income for the poor, private competition in essential services such as education, health, and cost reduction is necessary
 ise nitigat va niamak upayon se sunishchit kiya ja saktaa he
 This reform has also been hanging for a long time
 sarkaar ke kharch main kami or bazaar kaa paardarshee viniman, arthvyavastha ko bas yahi to chahie
 Just as India's economic policies had almost collapsed in 1991, the same is the condition of government spending and welfare schemes
 is koshish kii sabase badi chunauti inkaa pratikwaad he
 Due to the multitude of schemes, a pension of a few hundred rupees, small assistance or minor insurance is possible
 isliye inamen logon kii ruchi nahin hoti he or jo kuch bantata he, uskaa khaas asar nahin hota
 The country needs welfare schemes with maximum one or two big benefits with fast economic growth
 koi fark nahin padataa ki yah kaam modi karen yaa congress lekin yah sudhaar aprihaary he

 While Asrani has gathered crowds in Etawah to win bjp's heavyweight candidate Ramshankar Katheria, Keshav Prasad Maurya's helicopter is taking off for election campaign in Basarer, 12 km from Etawah
 yahaan keshav prasad maurya kii sabha main kam or kuch dur par khadey unke helicopter ko dekhne zyada log jute hai
 This time an interesting political battle of Katheria vs Katheria is going on in the SP stronghold
 bijepi kii taraf se purv cabinet mantri ramshankar katheria kaa muqabla gathbandhan ke kamalesh katheria se he jabaki bijepi chhodkar congress kaa daaman thaamnen vaale ashok dohare or pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke shanbhu dayaal dohare kisi kaa bhi siyaasi khel bana or bigaad sakate hai
 BJP has contested Ramshankar Katheria from Etawah by cutting ticket from Agra
 2014 main bijepi ke pratyaashibijepi ke ashok kumaar dohare ko 4,39,646 vot mili
 sp's Premdas Katheria received 2,66,700 votes, bsp's Ajay Pal Singh Jatav 1,92,804 votes and Congress's Hans Mukhi Kori got just 13000 votes
 isiilie ramshankar katheria apni jeet ko lekar nishcint hai
 BJP candidate Ramshankar Katheria says that this time there will be a big win from last time as Shivpal Yadav's party candidates will cut the votes of the alliance
 udhar, professor ramshankar katheria ko gathbandhan ke ummidavaar kamalesh katheria chunauti de rahe hai
 Kamlesh Katheria is the son of sp's former MP Premdas Katheria

 saath hi ram shankar katheria par bahari ummidavaar kaa thappa bhi laga he
 Kamlesh Katheria, the candidate of the coalition, says that Ramshankar Katheria who came from Agra will go there
 yahaan se gathbandhan he or itawa main jeet hasil hogi, lekin itawa kii siyaasi ladaai ko dilachasp bana rahe hai bijepi kaa daaman chhod kar congress ke ummidavaar ashok dohare or bispi kaa saath chhod shivpal yadav kii party se ladane vaale shanbhu dayaal dohare
 Last time, Ashok Doher had wrested this seat from the SP by winning a huge victory on a BJP ticket
 isliye itawa sansadeey kshetra ke wo bhi majboot pratyaashee maane ja rahe hai
 If the dual candidates make a dent in the Dalit voters, it can be an advantage or disadvantage to the Khetria candidates
 lekin ashok dohare apni jeet ko lekar khaasaa bharosa he
 Congress candidate Ashok Dohra says that we are winning in Etawah by two lakh votes
 itawa main har party ne apni puri takat jhonk rakhi he
 There is no issue of potato farmers here but Modi's nationalism on one side and the fight to save the reputation of Akhilesh Yadav on the other side, the winds of politics are flowing around
