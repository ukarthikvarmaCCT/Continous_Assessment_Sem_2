 bachapan se jananath main cricket khilne or bandook chalaane kii khwaahish rakhane vaale imran khan ab pakistan ke agle pradhanmantri banenge
 Imran Khan's Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf party has emerged as the largest political party in the general election held in Pakistan on Wednesday
 cricket ke maidan se nikalakar aspataal ke galiyare se raajnneeti main utre imran khan ne chunaav se pehle janata ke saamne apane 'nae pakistan' kii jo tasviir rakhi thi, us par ab charchaa shuru ho gai he
 Especially on the issue of Kashmir, terrorism and India, Imran Khan's opinion is very important
 wo kai baar bharat ke khilaaf bolte najar aate hai, to kai baar apane mulk se aatankwaad ko khatm karne or bharat se dosti karne kii baat karte hai
 Imran Khan has also captured the picture of Pakistan of his dreams in his biography 'pakistan: a Personal History'
 isamen wo apni islamic pahchaan or aadhyatmik sansar kaa bhi zikr kiya he
 Let us know Imran Khan's opinion on many issues including Kashmir, terrorism, democracy and India
 
 
 
 Advocate of eliminating terrorism from Pakistan, Imran Khan took part in the Agenda Aaj Tak program on December 7, 2012, in which he promised about the last election that if his government is formed, within 90 days, Pakistan will eliminate terrorism Will go
 nae pakistan main dehshatgardi ke liye koi jagah nahin hogi
 Pakistan's land will not be allowed to be used for terrorism against India
 unhone yah bhi vaada kiya tha ki unki sarkaar banane ke baad mumbai hamale ke mastermind hafiz said ko bharat ke khilaaf jehar nahin ugalane diya jayega
 Let it be known that terrorism is a big issue between India and Pakistan
 seemaa paar se bharat main ghuspaith ke chalate donon deshon ke rishte sudharne kaa naam nahin le rahe hai
 If Imran Khan succeeds in taking effective action against terrorism, it will surely be in the interest of both countries
 dilachasp baat yah he kiimran khankai muddon par pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarif bhi karte rahe hai
 Once when he met PM Modi, he praised him and looked very impressed with him
 kashmir masale ko sulajhane kii vakaltimran khan kaa maananaa he ki kashmir masale ko donon desh back channel ke jariye sulajhaa sakate hai or ab iskaa vakt aa chukaa he
 It is also in the interest of both countries to do so
 saal 2012 main ajtak ke ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha tha, 'bharat or pakistan milakar kashmir samet sabhi aapasi vivaadit mudde sulajhaa sakate hai
 However, where India and Pakistan stand today
 isko dekhte hue yah kahana ki ham apane ye masale aasaani se hal kar lenge, galat he
 But it can definitely be said that if my party is formed, then we will resolve these issues
 'unhone teen purv videsh mantriyon ke hawaale se yah bhi daawa kiya tha ki back channel ke jariye kashmir kaa masalaa kai baar sulajhane ke kareeb aa chukaa tha, lekin kisi karanvash nahin ho sakaa
 He said that we understand that this issue can be resolved
 is dauraan unhone yah bhi vaada kiya tha ki unki sarkaar banane ke baad donon deshon ke bich vishwaas bahaali ke liye kadam uthaaya jayega
 Imran Khan wants a democracy based on Islam
 In Imran Khan's imagination, there is a democracy whose foundation rests on Islam or a democracy with the title of Islam on top
 lekin imran apane is islamic loktantr ko paribhaashit kar paane main asafal rahe hai
 Islam and democracy are two different things
 islam jahaan khilaafat ke jariye hukumat kii baat karata he, to vahiin loktantr main janata dwaara chuni hui sarkaar kaa shashan hota he
 It has the freedom to choose its representatives, freedom of expression, criticism, freedom to live, eat and drink in its own way, while Islam says that you live life in the prescribed manner
 aise main imran kii islamic loktantr kii kalpana samaj se pare he
 Perhaps a big reason behind the lame democracy of Pakistan is also because before Imran, Pakistani rulers tried to land the dream of Islamic democracy
 haalanki imran khan apane desh kii raajnneeti ke bigade swaroop ko sudhaarna chaahate hai
 Supporting talks with the Taliban: Imran Khan is known as a pro-taliban in Pakistan
 haalanki iske liye wo pakistan kii angreji media ko jimmedaar tehraate he
 When writing the history of himself and his country, Imran explains about the Taliban and Al Qaeda, it is clear from his selection of words that Imran has an inclination towards the Taliban
 soviet sangh ke khilaaf kabatoli ladaakon ko america dwaara prashikshan diya janaa or phir dashak bhar baad inhen ladaakon ko duniya ke liye khatarnaak bataate hue yuddh ched dena yaa phir 9 / 11 ke baad puri daniya main musalamaanon ke khilaaf america ke yuddh chhedane kii apratyaksh muhim kii imran khan khulkar mukhaalafat karte rahe hai
 Apart from this, Imran does not like to give Pakistan's knee in front of the imperialist policies of America
 allaah, army or america ke saath satta kaa gathjodimran khanka maananaa he ki pakistan main vahi raaj kar saktaa he, jiske saath 3A yani allaah, army or america hon
 However, in the democracy of which Imran Khan dreams, the role of the army is on the border
 wo pakistan main america ke dakhal ke bhi khilaaf hai
 In this election, the army openly supported Imran Khan and won him
 saal 1996 main gathit raajnneetik party taharik-e-insaaf ko kai pareshaaniyon kaa saamana karnaa pada, jiske centre main imran rahe
 In the 2002 elections, his party won one seat for the first time
 islam or kabyli mulyon ko zyada tavajjoimran khan pashchimi sansthaaon or unke secularism kii baat karte he, lekin apni paramparaon or saamaajik dhaanche ko sarvshereshth bataate hai
 He is also a critic of the Western way of life
 jindagi ke shuruuaati saal pashchim main gujaarne vaale imran khan vahaan kii raajnneetik vyavastha se prabhavit hai, lekin cricket se sanyas lene ke baad se unamem islam, kabyli mulyon or pahanaavon ke prati zyada lagaav paidaa ho gaya
 One thing that is seen all over the world is that if a person has a strong sense of his culture and values, then he is declared right-wing in his own country
 pakistan kii angreji media dwaara imran ko taliban samarthak ke rup main pesh kiye jane ke peeche yah bhi ek kaaran ho saktaa he
 Romance with politics Imran Khan's romance with politics is interesting
 haal hi main unhone khud se kaaphi choti pakistani patrkaar reham khan se shaadi kii thi
 However, their marriage did not last long and the relationship broke up
 donon main talaak ho gaya
 After this, Imran Khan got married third
 pakistan main unke romance kii kaaphi charchaa rahati he

 sabhi ko maaloom he ki sonia ke baad rahul congress adhyaksh banenge
 After a big defeat in 2014, it was decided that Rahul Gandhi would take over the command soon
 sutron ne to kai tareekhen tak bataa deen thim
 Rahul also started to make big decisions of the party, but the wait of the president was confirmed
 somvaar ko congress kii kaarysmiti kii baithak main purv piem manmohan singh or eke antni ne rahul kii maujuudagi main kaha ki samay aa gaya he ab rahul gandhi ko party kaa adhyaksh ban janaa chahie
 After which all the leaders supported it
 sarvasammati se kaarysmiti ne iske liye sifarish kar di
 According to sources, when Rahul was asked to become president, Rahul said that i am ready, but if someone has a reservation in mind, please let me know
 main varisht or yuvaaon ke saamanjasy ke saath chalanaa chahta hum
 On this issue, party's media in-charge Randeep Surjewala said that Rahul Gandhi himself is also ready to accept every challenge
 lekin aadhikarik taur par rahul kab kaman sanbhaalenge, is par surajevaala ne kaha ki congress kaarysmiti kii baithak yaa phir adhiveshan bulaakar rahul ko adhyaksh banaaya jayega, jisaki ek prakriya he
 It can happen tomorrow, also in December and next year
 yani ek baar phir taarikh saamne nahin aa pai
 At the same time, the working committee passed the proposal and also sent it to the Election Commission that for the election of the party's organization, it again needs a one-year extension, that is till December 2017
 baithak main sonia nahinvaise sutron ke mutabik, kaarysmiti kii baithak main beemaari ke chalate sonia nahin ain
 Rahul chaired the meeting, after which everyone made this recommendation
 yani sonia ne party ke bheetar puraane or nae ke bich kii dophaad ko khatm kar sabko rahul ke peeche khadey dikhaane kii koshish kii or wo bhi apni anupasthiti main
 At the same time, Sonia also tried to give at least her message that she was not imposing Rahul
 kul milakar sab kuch aisa maano kahani kii script pehle hi likhi ja chuki ho
 In such a situation, now the Gandhi family has to set a date to command Rahul
 parivaar ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik, gandhi parivaar ke paas kai prastaav hai
 1
 19 november ko indira gandhi ke janmdin ke din aisa ho
 2
 upi chunaav ke thik pehle kiya jaae, jisase chunaav main phayda ho
 3
 rahul party main chunaav ke pakshdhar rahe hai, isliefarvari main rajyon ke chunaavake baad wo sanghathan chunaav ke jariye kaman sanbhaalein
 Due to this, if the party performed poorly in these states, it should not be blamed on Rahul
 aise main ab gend gandhi parivaar ke paale main he or zyaadaatar netaa is haq main chunaav vagairah to lage rahete hai, jab rahul ko kaman saunpny he to jaldi saunp di jaae

 ye intervyuu bollywood superstar akshay kumaar ne liya he, jisamen piem ne apane parivaar, apane nijee jivan se judi baton ko duniya ke saamne rakhaa

 1
 Desiring to enter the army, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also talked about his dream in the interview, he said that he never had the idea of becoming Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki saamaanya logon ke man main ye vichaar aata bhi nahin hai or meraa jo family becoground hai usamen mujhe koi choti naukari mil jaati to meri maa usee main puure gaanv ko gud ke pue khilaa detii
 The PM said that he was affected by the war of 1962, whenever army personnel used to stand like children and salute them, then it was felt that i should be recruited in the army
 2
 What did he want to become and what did he want to do besides being admitted to the army? The Prime Minister said that i went to the Ramakrishna Mission Ashram
 nae-nae anubhav hone lage
 Around 20 years of age, he wandered around, wandered and saw the world
 man main sawaal paidaa karata tha or kuch jawaab talashta tha or bhatakate-bhatakate yahaan tak pahunch gaya
 It seems difficult to say what i became because what i had not thought became (prime Minister)
 3
 How strict is PM Modi? PM told that i am strict, i am disciplined but never do any work to degrade anyone
 aksar koshish karata hum ki kisi kaam ko kaha to usamen khud involve ho jaaun
 He said that i also learn and teach and go on forming teams
 4
 Ghulam Nabi sends good friend, Mamta Didi, Kurte Prime Minister told that Ghulam Nabi Azad of Congress was his very good friend
 kaaphi pehle jab main or gulam nabi baaten kar rahe the to media ne poocha ki ye to sangh vaale hai or aap inke dost hai
 He said that Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee gives one to two kurtas every year
 iske alaava bangladesh kii shaikh hasina bhi unhen har saal mithaiyaan bhejti hai
 5
 pitaaji gussa karte the to kya karte the modi?pm ne kaha ki main kabhi kisi se miltaa hum to meraa kabhi koi phone nahin aata he, maine khud ko jivan ko aisa anushaasit banaaya he
 As far as Humer is concerned, i always used to be angry with my father in my family, then the whole atmosphere would light up
 6
 Jokes are heard and heard in Modi
 In the interview, the Prime Minister said that my strict image which has been created is not correct
 main kaam ke liye kisi par dabaav nahin banaata hum
 i sit in the Prime Minister's Office till late in the morning, it did not happen before
 is tarah team spirit banati he or mere aasapaas ye ek work culture ban jaataa he
 He said that if someone is spoiling his time in mobile during the meeting, then i ask what happened to what i was saying right now
 tab se meri meeting main koi mobile phone yuj nahin karata
 i always try to lighten the atmosphere in the meeting
 7
 How much money in Modi's account? Talking with Akshay, Modi said that when i became CM from Gujarat, i did not have a bank account
 jab MLA bana to selary aani lagi
 People from Dena Bank came to school
 unhone bacchon ko gullak diya or kaha ki isamen paise jamaa karen or bank main jamaa kar den
 But we would have had it if we had
 tab se acount yun hi padaa rahaa
 The PM said that a plot is available from the government, some is available at a lower price, then i gave it to the party, although there are some rules on which the matter is in the Supreme Court
 jaise hi vah clear hoga, plot main party ke naam kar duungaa
 8
 ritair hone ke baad kya karenge modi?ritairement ke sawaal par jawaab dete hue PM modi ne ek kissa sunaaya
 Narendra Modi said, 'we had an inner circle meeting
 atal ji, adwani ji, rajmata sindhiya ji, pramod mahajan ji the
 i was the youngest of them
 usamen aise hi baat chhidi ki retaratment ke baad kya karenge
 When i asked, i said, it is very difficult for me
 mujhe jo jimmevary milti he, vahi karata jaataa hum
 Therefore, no such idea ever came to my mind

 uttar pradesh kii siyasat main basapa-sapa gathbandhan main ab bhi congress kii ummiden jinda hai
 Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's entry into active politics just before the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh's politics has once again raised hopes of the Congress gaining a place in the SP-BSP alliance against the BJP
 enditivi ko mili sutron se jaankaree kii maane congress samaajawaadee party ke netritv ke sampark main he or priyanka gandhi congress ke sapa-basapa gathbandhan main shaamil hone or zyada se zyada siton hasil karne ke mudde par akhilesh yadav se sidhe taur par baatcheet karengi
 Samajwadi Party leaders told NDTV that Akhilesh Yadav is ready for talks, but the biggest challenge is to convince Mayawati
 haalanki, on record unhone kaha ki donon partiyaan congress ke saath baatcheet kii sambhaavnaaon par kisi tarah ke coment karne kii sthiti main nahin he
 Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh Pramod Tiwari told NDTV that this is an issue on which i cannot comment
 darasal, priyanka gandhi ne 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle bhi akhilesh yadav ke saath gathbandhan kii baatcheet ke kaman ko sambhala tha
 But the results in the election proved to be quite bad for both parties
 phir bhi, akhilesh yadav ne bhavishya ke gathjodon se inkaar nahin kiya tha
 However, in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, there was no final round of seat sharing
 bataaya jaataa he ki soobe main congress netaaon ke adiyal ravaiye kii vajah se akhilesh yadav or mayawati ne congress ko gathbandhan se alag kar diya tha
 While SP and BSP mlas are still supporting the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 darasal, upi kii sabhi 80 loksabhaa siton par congress ne apane ummidavaar utaarne kaa elaan kiya he
 80 seats of UP are important for any party to rule in the center
 yahi vajah he ki upi main congress ko majboot karne or adhik se adhik seat jeetne ke iraade se rahul gandhi ne apana sabase bada siyaasi daanv chalaa or priyanka gandhi ko purvi upi kii kaman de di
 Not only this, in addition to Priyanka Gandhi, Rahul put Jyotiraditya Scindia in charge of Western UP to conquer UP
 jabaki mayawati kii bahujan samaja party or akhilesh kii samaajawaadee party uttar pradesh main 38-38 siton par ladane ke liye sahamat hui he, to ab congress netaaon kaa kahana he ki unhen ummid he ki ve akhilesh yadav kam se kam 8 se 10 seat ke dene ke liye manaa lenge
 However, such claims of the Congress leader were denied by the SP leaders
 unka kahana he ki agar unki party sirf 28 siton par chunaav ladegi, to yah hamaare liye phydemand nahin hoga
 For the Congress seats both parties have to give up
 haalanki, sapa netaaon ne yah bhi kaha ki akhilesh yadav bijepi ko haraane ke liye best sichuation chaahate hai
 At the same time, the official spokesman of Akhilesh Yadav said that such reports are fictitious
 bataa den ki isse pehle yadav parivaar kii choti bahu aparnaa yadav bhi priyanka gandhi kii tarif kar chuki hai
 He said that if Priyanka Gandhi was made the face of the Chief Minister on behalf of the alliance in 2017, the results would have been different

 But later the Congress high command ignored him and made Madhya Pradesh Congress President Kamal Nath the CM

 But later when the party suffered a crushing defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, he resigned from the post of general secretary

 co / msna2oenjk kareeb 100 karod rupee ke bajet se dilli kii aabhohawaa ko pradooshan se bachaane kaa ek nayaa plan taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Under this, several measures will be taken like banning the burning of paddy straw, setting up fodder banks, composting in the field of straw
 yahi nahin, kheton ke prabandhan main berozegaar yuvaaon ko rojgaar milegaa or inamen happy seader jaisi nai mashiinon kaa istemaal hoga
 The initiative is being led by the Union Ministry of Forest, Environment and Climate Change to discourage the practice of burning paddy straw in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, the Economic Times reported
 iske peeche sabase bada uddeshy yahi he ki dilli kii aabhohawaa ko shuddh rakhaa ja sake
 According to officials, this program will require a lot of technical solution, as it is the biggest challenge to deal with the straw left over from the paddy crop
 gauratlab he ki punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh or rajasthan main dhan kii fasal kataai ke baad bachane vaale paraali ko jala dene kaa chalan jor-shor se chal padaa he
 Due to this, pollution in Delhi increases considerably especially in the last three-four and in the winter it becomes a smog
 neshnal centre for organic farming dwaara biowest decompoger kaa vikaas kiya ja rahaa he
 By this, the starch will be composted in the field itself
 yah paraali ko 40 se 50 din main upyogi compost main badal degaa
 According to the plan, farmers will be encouraged for this
 isamen gaay-bhainson ke gobar kaa bhi istemaal ho jayega
 Actually farmers have to prepare their field quickly for the rabi i
e
 wheat crop after the kharif crop, so they burn the paddy straw
 yojana ke anusaar rajya sarkaron berozegaar yuvaaon kisahakaari samitiyansthapit karengi jinke dwaara kisaanon ko happy seader mashine kiraye par dene ke centre shuru kiye jaaenge
 The Happy Cedar Tractor consists of a machine that harvests and harvests the stove, sows wheat, and then puts the starch made into compost and then puts it in the field
 iske alaava charabnk bhisthapit kiye jane kii bhi yojana he, taaki bache hue paraali ko chaara ke rup main desh ke duusare hisse main bechaa ja sake

 Giriraj, however, was in a mood to target the Congress

 Let us tell you that during the election campaign, Giriraj had told those opposing Narendra Modi to go to Pakistan

 haalanki iske 15 din baad hi state bank ne penalty bhi ghatai or jamaa rakam kii shart main bhi chhot de di
 It was also implemented from 1 October

 The trustee broker of the Mumbai-based NGO Moneylife Foundation, which has raised the voice for the customer's interests, says the Reserve Bank has nothing to do with these charges
 indian banking association ye chargeej laga rahe hai
 The cartel of banks is working, competition has disappeared as all banks are charging the same charges and penalties

 The bank charged Rs 50 on this
 jain kehete hai, ''jab se bainkon kii listing hui he tab se un par munafa dikhaane kaa dabaav he isliye ve kanjumar se tarah-tarah ke charge lete hai
 Banks are not worried about the consumer

 "by the way, financial consultant Sachin Srivastava in Delhi explains the reason for the minimum balance constraint," Banks incur a cost of about 125 rupees on a manual transaction, 11 rupees on ATM transactions and about six rupees on online transactions
 online main nuksaan nahin he
 The cost of ATM transaction is adjusted, but it is expensive to transact in the manual ie bank and that is why the banks are putting minimum balance obligations
 "bhartiya rigerv bank karmchaaree association ke mahasachiv ghosh bhi shrivastav se sahamat lagate hai

 He says, "if the bank wants to increase the limit, but if we keep the money in the savings account for a long time, then we should also get more interest

 "mumbai main certyphoid financial planar karthik javeri kehete hai ki bank minimum balance kaa istemaal karte hai or is rakam ko ve karj par de sakate hai chaahe ve ek din ke hi liye den
 Each bank maintains its cost differently

 It is sad to charge on pensioners, students and those who have nothing left

 Breaking silence on PNB Mahaghotale, he has given a big statement from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley

 Recently, Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that instead of small ministers, PM Modi or Finance Minister should give clarification in this matter
 is maamle par chuppi todate hue jetali ne auditors, management or nigaraanee agenciyon par sawaal uthaae hai
 Jaitley said that the auditors should ask themselves why they are not able to catch the irregularities
 RBI ko bhi nasihatjetali ne ishaaron-ishaaron main arabiai par bhi sawaal daag diya
 He said that supervisory agencies needed to find out what new systems should be adopted to catch irregularities
 nigaraanee agenciyon ko yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki chhutput maamalon ko shuru main hi pakad liya jaae or unki punrariti naa ho
 According to Jaitley, the banks' management machinery has not lived up to its responsibility, as they have failed to find out who among them are the ones who are going to mess up
 gauratlab he ki neerav modi or unke mamaa mehul chaukasee ne bank ke kuch adhikariyon ke saath milakar punjab neshnal bank (pienbi) main 11,300 karod rupee ke ghotaale ko anjaam diya or videsh bhaag gaye

 Generally, users save internet banking, credit card details and passwords in their smartphones and this will affect those users more
 Google Calendar fishing scam se kaise bachein In the midst of the ongoing protests in the Samajwadi Party and Mulayam Singh's family, Shivpal Yadav said, "I have no greed for the post of minister and will take on whatever responsibility Netaji gives

 Shivpal Yadav said that the Samajwadi Party is one and even if they do not get any responsibility, they will continue to perform their responsibility as Netaji had said
 ilaake main sinchai kii kami kii samasya par bolte hue shivpal yadav ne kaha ki aaj hamaare paas vibhaag nahin he

 unase saavdhaan rahanaa he
 'akhilesh, don't come in the flow', this is the response of Shivpal Yadav after tensions with Akhilesh came to the surface and he was dismissed from Akhilesh cabinet
 isse pehle shivpal yadav ne buudhvaar ko dilli pahunchane ke baad kaha tha ki ve pradesh adhyaksh hai or unhen siem se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 With this, Shivpal had also said that Akhilesh should not be misled by the people

 There are many people who think of quitting smoking at least ten times a day, but thinking that 'I will not be able to do this', they do not try for it
 zyaadaatar smoker yah sochate hai ki ve aisa kar hi nahin paaenge, vah bhi bina koshish kiye

 You may find it strange to know this, but smoking makes the test buds of the tongue bad and you may have trouble recognizing the taste of the spice
 yah baat to sabhi jaanate hai ki tambaakoo ke seven se kai tarah ke cancer hone ke chancej bad jate hai
 Tobacco increases the risk of developing cancer of the lung, upper gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, liver, kidney, urinary bladder, pancreas, nasal cavity, oral cavity, and cervix

 aam aadmi party sarkaar main mantri or party kii political afair kamity ke sadsy gopal raay ne 50 karod rupye menrajyasabhatikat beche jane ke aaropon par safai pesh kii he
 During a conversation with party workers on Facebook, Gopal Rai defended Arvind Kejriwal and listed 6 major reasons for not doing corruption
 gopal raay ne ginai ye 6 vajah:vajah number 1dilli main pichley 3 saal se prachand bahumat kiaam aadmi partisarkaar ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal hai
 If Arvind Kejriwal had to eat money, then power companies in Delhi have a turnover of crores
 hamaari sarkaar se pehle har saal bijli ke daam badhaaye jate the or karodon rupye khaae jate the
 If Arvind Kejriwal's intention had gone wrong and the power companies had increased the price, then crores of rupees could be got to the Aam Aadmi Party, but the Aam Aadmi Party has not come to power to compromise and earn money
 vajah number 2dilli ke andar ek hajaar se zyada privet skool hai
 Earlier, when the school fees were increasing, the people of BJP Congress used to collect money from schools as money
 agar arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party ko paisa lenaa hota to privet skulon ko fees badhaane kii chhot de dete
 But the government did not do so while private schools are being looted heavily
 vajah number 3tanker mafiaon se hazaron karod kii vasuuli kii jaati thi, lekin in mafiaon par lagaam sirf arvind kejariwal laga sakate hai
 Reason number 4 was the possession of drug mafias in Delhi
 lekin sarkaar dwaara davaaiyaan or ilaj muft karne ke baad drug mafiaon kaa jaal tut gaya he
 Reason number 5: There are many big hospitals in Delhi
 agar arvind kejariwal eemaandaaree kii raajnneeti nahin kar rahe hote to maiks hospital kaa license radd nahi hota
 The reason for Arvind Kejriwal's courage is honesty
 vajah number 6desh ke purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ne kaha tha ki jab 100 rupye nikalate hai to 90 rupye khatm ho jate hai or 10 rupye hi bachate hai
 The Delhi government has a budget of more than 40 thousand crores and Kejriwal can earn thousands of crores even if he sets 1%
 lekin aam aadmi party sarkaar ne aisa nahin kiya
 Gopal Rai took a dig at the opponents and said, "this is not the first time that the Aam Aadmi Party is being tried to destroy and discredit
" log kah rahe hai ki arvind kejariwal ne 50 karod main rajyasabha kii tikat bech di, lekin dilli main tamaam kaale dhandhe gaye band ho gaye hai or yahi vajah he ki arvind kejariwal ko har 3 maheene main beyimaan ghoshit karne kii koshish kii jaati he
 " dilli transport mantri gopal rainehadtaali ditisi bas driveronko naukari par lautne ke liye 3 ghante kaa ultimatum diya he
 He said that the government has decided that the driver will give the son a job, treat his mother and at the same time bear the expenses of children's education
 gopal raay ne kaha, 'sarkaar ne faisla kiya he ki unke bete ko naukari degi, maa kaa ilaaj kaa kharchaa uthaaegi or saath hi bacchon kii padhai kaa kharchaa bhi uthaaegi
 The BJP has affected the lives of 45 lakh people and now the ESMA law has been enacted
 'unhone kaha, 'kuch depo main get roke gaye hai

 While the Congress criticized Sitharaman's behavior, the Defense Ministry today issued a statement in this regard blaming the state minister for the incident as unfortunate

 When an officer told him that the media was recording his statements, he said let them record it
 In response to the gross misinformation that has been circulating in the news for the past 24 hrs, the below statement has been issued

 As the matter progressed, the Defense Ministry today issued a clarification on the incident and questioned the behavior of the Minister of State
 spashtikaran main kaha gaya he ki kaarykram ke anusaar prabhavit kshetron ke daure ke baad raksha mantri baadh se buree tarah se prabhavit purv sanyakarmiyon se rubaru ho rahi thim ki isi dauraan jila prabharee mantri ne is par aapatti jataai or jor diya ki adhikariyon ke saath baithak pehle honi chahie
 The ministry said that the defense minister has clarified that the welfare of ex-servicemen is an essential part of the ministry and it was as per schedule
 jila mantri ne jor diya ki raksha mantri tatkaal unke saath baatcheet ko rokkar adhikariyon ke saath baithak ke liye chale
 The ministry said that Sitharaman immediately stopped the meeting and left for a meeting with the officials
 unhone kaha ki us sthaan ko pehle se hi press conference ke liye banaaya gaya tha or jaldbaaji main samiksha ke liye vahaan adhikariyon ko bhi bula liya gaya
 It was unprecedented to have a meeting with officials in the presence of all the media persons
 mantralay ne kaha ki iske baad raksha mantri ke khilaaf nijee tippanee kii gai jo pratikriya dene laayak bhi nahin thi
 After this incident, Mahesh said that Sitharaman's statement came as a response to the demand for funds from the Center for Kodagu

 That is, an atmosphere of chaos has been created

 That day is the birthday of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pandit Madanmohan Malviya
 is khabar ne jabardast vivaad paidaa kar diya he
 After all, how can a big holiday be canceled, especially since that day thousands of schools have winter holidays and children from other cities go to their homes and so on
 mantri ne is tarah kaa farmaan kaise jari kiya, yah kisi kii samaj main nahin aayaa
 Now he has clarified through Twitter that there is nothing like this and schools will be closed that day but an essay competition will be online
 mantri ne is bare main apana spashtikaran diya or is babat khabaron ko jhootha bataaya
 It is not understood why the Ministry of Human Resources is taking steps to create controversy
 isse kiskaa bhala hoga, yah bhi spasht nahin he
 Christmas is a festival of joy and everyone gets involved
 smriti irani ne bhi apane skool main christmas kii chhuttiyaan manaai hongi
 Of course she would not have participated in the celebrations, but this half-hearted decision to change the happiness of others is sad
 ab smriti ne saaf kar diya he ki us din skool band rahenge lekin sawaal yah he ki aisa anaavashyak vivaad kyon uthaa? behatar hoga smriti vivaadon se bachein or is mantralay ke kaamkaaj ko behatar banaaen
 It is directly connected to the future of the country and every step needs to be taken thoughtfully here
 unhen yah bhi samajhnaa hoga ki chhuttiyaan radd kar dene se bachche zyada nahin padhane lagenge

 This accident is very much caused by Saturn Mars
 chot ke samay jis raashi kaa prabhaav zyada hota he, sharir ke usee hisse main chot zyada aa jaati he
 What are the remedies if the conditions of the accident have been created? - Greet the Lord while leaving the house- If possible, read Hanuman Chalisa as well - Get out of the house after eating something sweet- Avoid black clothes if hurt again and again
 What are the remedies if you are doing this? - Offer water to the sun every morning - apply a tilak of roli on the forehead or on the throat; Wear an iron ring - Mustard oil given under the peepal on Saturday evening A
 Burn - wear shoes with sandal only if you have a small child and get hurt repeatedly - give the child a bath daily - add a little rose water to the bath water - touch a red thread by touching Hanuman ji in the child's neck- For the child, the mother or father should donate the white item on Monday- Take an opal or pearl after taking advice from the child
 agar ghar kii mahilaon kaa swasthya kharaab rahata ho- ghar main ek tulsi kaa paudha jarur lagaaein- uske neeche niyamit rup se deepak jalaaen- achche swasthya ke liye prarthana karen

 When Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi came to the tiled hall of Yojana Bhavan, there was a stir
 sachivon or salaahkaaron kaa kahana he ki yojana ayog ke saamne unki vaarshik prajentation live parformens se kam nahin hoti thi lubhaavne jumale or audio-vijual clips ke jariye ve bataate ki pichley saal unke rajya ne kya hasil kiya or agle saal apni ummiden puri karne ke liye unhen kya chahie
 a former member of the commission says, "modi is very enthusiastic and energetic, his secretaries never needed to speak anything
" ve baarik se baarik nukton ko bhi khud hi bataate the
 "but over the years they did not get the response they expected
 ayog ke adhikariyon ke patharaye chehre gujarat ke maanav vikaas suchakank main neeche rahane ke liye aalochana kiya karte
 Gradually, Modi's interest in the Planning Commission started diminishing and his presentation level also started to decline
 andruni sutron ke mutabik, pehle ve ayog ko vichaaron or sujhaavon ke liye mahatvapurn maanate the, lekin baad main ve use aisi sanstha maanane lage jo nithlle arthshaastriyon or naukarshahon kaa jamaavada he, jinka na koi yogadan hota he, na ayog kii upyogita badhaate hai
 "during a presentation in 2009, he showed a film on Gujarat and said that he would answer every question," says an advisor who was present at one such meeting
 isse spasht he ki tab ve ayog ke bare main kya raay rakhte the
 "finally in 2013, he came to Yojana Bhavan with a video that said the commission acts like a" bully "and does not take into account the special needs of some states
 ab nai sarkaar ne yojana ayog ko mrityu shaiyya par lita diya he, swatantraaa diwas ko pradhanmantri modi ne elaan kiya ki jald hi iskaa vajood khatm ho jayega
 Instead of mourning the expiry of the commission, officials of central ministries and state governments are overjoyed
 pehle to ayog kaa vajood hi mitaa dene kii is karrwai ko rajnatik sandarbh main dekha janaa chahie
 The chief minister of a state is in power at the center and demolishes the institution which has blocked the road instead of supporting the development model of its state
 lekin maamla sirf modi kaa nahin he, ayog se mote taur par sabhi netaaon or niti-niyantaaon kaa mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 It was said about him that he stuck to development and was ignorant of the needs of modern India
 yahi vajah he ki modi ne jis teji se ayog kaa marsia padhaa, isaki jagah nai sanstha laane kii prakriya dhimi hi chal rahi he
 Thoughts are being invited from the general public and big economists on the look and functioning of this new super "think tank"
 beshak, isse ek tarah kii vaicharik saundarya pratiyogita shuru ho gai he, jisamen arvind pangadipha se lekar bibek debaroy, bimal jalaan se lekar suresh prabhu tak main modi ko aashwast karne kii hode much gai he ki unka idia hi sarvaadhik praasangik he
 But the important question is whether it is enough to abolish this institution or the bureaucracy through which it became a white elephant should also be reformed
 kaise hua ayog bemaani?yojana ayog kii shuruyaat 1950 main ek gaiyr- sanvaidhanik sanstha ke rup main hui thi, jise bharat ke simit sansadhano kaa bantwaaraa har kshetra or rajya main karnaa tha
 It was then assigned five important tasks
 yojana bhawan ke bagal main rashtriya sankhyaki ayog ke pramukh pranab sen kabhi yojana ayog ke salaahkaar rah chuke hai
 He talks about those five important functions of the Commission: One, the Commission had to prepare five-year plans, which could decide the roadmap for all-round development
 duusare, yah tay karnaa tha ki sarkaar nitiyon or yojanaon ke maamle main kis had tak hastkshep kar sakati he or har yojana ke liye kitne paise kii jarurat padegi
 Thirdly, it was to assess whether each scheme is compatible with the scheme and whether resources can be optimally utilized
 chauthe, har skim kaa moolyankan or satat nigaraanee karnaa tha, taaki yah dekha ja sake ki unka sahi kriyanvayan ho rahaa he yaa nahin
 Fifth was to establish coordination between the various ministries and the Center and the states

 The five-year plan for allocation of resources became irrelevant after the 1991 economic reforms, as the remaining resources began to be given to the private sector
 aadhunik bharat main paanch saal ke liye yojana taiyaar karnaa adikalin kadam hi kehalaayegaa
 "when Flipkart is valued at $ 1 billion to $ 7 billion a year, what is the point of having a five-year economic target and estimating it?" Says an advisor to the commission
 Since then, the way of government intervention has completely changed
 apane astitv ke pehle 19 saal main yojana ayog ne desh ke vikaas kaa najariya banaaya or har rajya ko apane vivek se fund uplabdh karwaae
 But that phase was completely different - Congress was ruled in almost all the states and the newly independent country was confident in the development outlook of Jawaharlal Nehru
 lekin 1967 tak yah spasht ho chukaa tha ki ise band hi kiya janaa chahie
 Separate states formed governments of separate parties which did not have a good rapport with the Center

 The states needed a separate objective system for the sharing of money and carried out it

 Later, most of the central assistance started reaching through the central schemes rather than direct help, which the states had to implement
 is kendriya yojana ke kharch par kisi kaa niyantran jaruri tha
 So, then the conflict between the Commission and the states started

 Especially Modi and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J

 Parallel bureaucracy-like central schemes increased (currently 137) and their review and monitoring became the most time-consuming task
 ek salaahkaar bataate hai ki yah shtantr jalya main funs gaya-kyonki ayog main har mantralay se judi ek ikai hoti thi, jisamen sachivalay, daftar or nijee staff hota tha, jo praayah ekadam alag nateezon par pahunchate the
 In fact, instead of being a platform for exchange of ideas and a wider perspective, Yojana Bhavan became the base of parallel departments

 But instead of evaluating the programs, ieo's first suggestion was to abolish the Planning Commission itself
 yah prahasan yaheen khatm nahin hota
 IEO chief Ajay Chhibber was removed, who would be proud to think that Modi has abolished the commission on his recommendation

 During the 10-year rule of the UPA government, the Planning Commission got the support of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, headed by Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and jumped into areas it should have left for others
 usne infrastracchar kshetra kii badi saarvajanik-nijee bhagidaari (pipipi) pariyojnaon ke karaaron kaa akalan shuru kar diya
 This was the beginning of a long battle with the ministries of transport and energy

 For example, on 3 January this year, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) Chairman R

 Singh wrote to the Surface Transport Secretary, "pre-appraisal meetings should be closed as they do not benefit and the Commission makes the same suggestions every time
" ’’ 2013 main ayog ne naksal prabhavit ilaakon ke liye nau binduon vaali kaaryayojna taiyaar kii, jis par vah is tarah amal kar rahaa tha maano koi mantralay ho
 Voices of protest also arose from this
 in vajahon se ayog apana paanchvaan kaary- vibhinn mantralayon or rajyon sarkaron ke bich samanvay nahin kar paaya, jabaki itani sarkaron or vibhaagon vaale desh main yah behad jaruri tha
 It is still relevant, although the Planning Commission is coming to an end, but there is a consensus that there is a need for an institution that is not so big as to outline the future development of the country
 apni haal kii pustak ridiining da eiroplen whil flyingeh riforming institutions main purv yojana ayog sadsy arun maayra yaad karte hai ki manmohan singh ne 2009 main hi bataaya tha ki ayog ko khud ko vyavastha sudhaar ayog ke rup main tabdeel kar lenaa chahie
 Myra was also given a list of "20 eminent people", including former senior bureaucrats, former Commission members and leading industrialists
 in sabase yojana ayog ke nae swaroop ke bare main baat kii jaani thi
 All those whom Myra spoke to agreed that a group of economists in New Delhi should not be empowered to allocate resources, especially in today's era when the administration of states is doing well and He has more information about ground truths
 unke anusaar aisi ranneetik sanstha kii jarurat he, jisamen visheshgy hon or jo vistrut dhang se soche, sarkaar tathaa udyogon ko input uplabdh karwaae ki desh kii arthvyavastha ko kya aakaar lenaa chahie
 That is, a super think tank, which is not bound by the five-year deadline or a group of thinkers who tell the government what the country needs - interconnected rivers or bullet trains, IT hubs or sugar mills, 8,000 Thriving cities or 100 smart cities
 ek purv upaadhyaksh, jo ab ayog kii jagah duusari sanstha ke swaroop kii ruparekha taiyaar karne vaali baithkon main shaamil rahete hai, unka kahana he ki nai sanstha ko vibhinn mantralayon main samanvay main mukhya bhoomika nibhaani chahie
 He says, "about six ministries will have to be involved to formulate a plan to build toilets for rural women, which takes a lot of time
" iske liye ek adhikrut sanstha kii jarurat he, jo saare drushtikonon ko jodakar aage badaye
 Economist Bibek Debroy also believes that there is a need for an institution that brings long-term goals
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘yadi sarkaar faisla karti he ki 2040 tak shishu mrityu dar itani ho jaani chahie, to yah koun aashwast karegaa ki yah aankada hasil karne ke liye sakriy agenciyaan sahi disha main chal rahi hai
 He says that planning would have been better if there was a decentralized exercise working from the ground level
 2013-14 ke aarthik surveykshan main nai sarkaar ne jin thos kadamon kii baat kii he, ye uske anukool hai
 For this a new Productivity Commission will be required which will prepare the report cards of government departments and ministries and make them public

 Many experts have expressed apprehensions about this
 unka tark he ki vitt mantralay kii takat par kisi tarah kaa niyantran nahin rah jayega
 He will create the fund and also decide where to spend it
 debaroy bataate hai, ‘‘vitt mantralay kharch kam karne kii koshish karata he, aise main uskaa pehla shikaar saamaajik kshetra kaa kharch ho saktaa he
 "some people say that handing over these tasks to other organizations is not going to change anything
 fark bas yah hoga ki imaarat badal jaaegi
 Says a senior government secretary, "to eliminate the Planning Commission, it is necessary that the government should abstain from these procedures
 iskaa arth hoga vikendrikaran kii disha main baduya
 "the nature of this new institution will be the litmus test of the Modi government dedicated to the federal system, especially if their government reduces the number of central schemes and sends lump sum money to the state governments

 At the time of his appearance, a man named Rajesh, who was standing in public, slapped him

 Significantly, the Kheda District Police arrested him on Tuesday for making inflammatory statements
 mehandi hasan par dharmik bhaawanaaon ke apmaan kaa aarope laga he
 The action was taken by the Kheda District Police after opposition from Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Hinduist organizations over his statement
 gauratlab he ki mehandi hasan ne kaha tha ki garba par rakshason kaa kabja ho gaya he
 This is the same Imam who in 2011 had wanted Narendra Modi to wear a Muslim cap on stage, but was denied by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat
 kheda gaanv main imam hossain ne kaha ki garba ek dharmik tyohaar nahin, balki rakshason ke liye manoranjan he
 Imam Mehndi Hussain said on Sunday, 'sadhus and saints do not appear in Garba

 a controversy arose over his statement

 It is worth noting that the controversy over the garba ceremony during Navratri is not taking name

 (input bhashaa se) The Delhi Government has given a three-week ultimatum to the three Municipal Corporations of Delhi, that they should bring any action plan to overcome the losses

 In a special conversation with NDTV India, Deputy CM Sisodia said that there should be accountability of why corporations are running in deficit
 teenon nagar nigam ke ayuktaon ko kaha gaya he ki vah teen hafte main nigam ko ghate se ubaarane kaa aisa plan bataaen ki nigam ek saal main kaise ghate se nikalegaa

 According to Meenakshi Devi, the sources of revenue in this Municipal Corporation are less and the expenses are more so that the condition of the corporation is so bad that it is also difficult to give salary to the employees and pension has not been given for two years
 meyar ke mutabik, unhone dilli ke siem arvind kejariwal se milane kaa samay maanga he, jisamen vah nigam ke halaat par unako jaankaree dengi, lekin unako abhi tak samay nahin mil paaya he
 Let us tell you that while the annual loss in the East Delhi Municipal Corporation is around 500 crore rupees, the loss in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is about seven hundred crore rupees annually, while the South Delhi Municipal Corporation still has no loss or profit

 For example, the revenue from South Delhi region is higher, whereas it was argued that the Municipal Corporation will now see its revenue and expenses and strengthen itself

 Just as the central government gives money to Delhi in the form of grants or aid, similarly the Delhi government gives grants or assistance to the Municipal Corporation in its budget, so the new AAP government of Delhi says that it wants to bring the municipal corporation back on track
 And he believes that due to corruption, the municipal corporation is in loss and now it is up to the corporations to come up with a plan

 ab bollywood main pehali baar kisi actress ne namchin shakhsiyat par sangeen aarope lagaae hai
 After a clarification from one side in the case, Actress Sushri Duttane mentioned the incident related to India Today TV in an exclusive conversation
 tanushri ne kaha ki is maamle ko aise pesh kiya ja rahaa he ki ek bold actress ne femes or pratishthit actor par aarope lagaae hai
 You did not know what was the atmosphere 10 years ago
 duusari actress ke bare main bhi naanaa ke is tarah ke vyavhaar kii bollywood main charchaa hoti he
 i have no evidence of this, but it has been heard
 48 saal kii padmalakshmi kaa khulaasa- 16 kii umr main hua tha meraa repanaanaa ke khilaaf exiaar file karne ke sawaal par tanushri ne kaha, "main police stesan shikaayat ke liye gai thi or vahaan sab kuch bataaya
 But before we could understand anything, a counter FIR was already ready
 mujhe nahin pataa ki ve hamaari shikaayat ke kaaran kitni pareshaani se gujarey hai, lekin unke exiaar ke kaaran mere pita, spotboy or heredressor ko saalon tak pareshaan kiya jaataa rahaa
 "nana Patekar wanted to forcibly get closer," Tanushree said referring to a 10-year-old case, despite not being a part of the song during the shoot, despite trying to get intimate with her
 "gurmeet kii image bhi alag thi, lekin jab sach saamne aayaa to
 
 
 Tanushree said that in such cases one should not go to one's image
 koi baahar acha actor ho saktaa he, lekin persenalee kairactor uskaa kaisaa he ye jaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Gurmeet Ramraheem and all the Babas were also worshiped, they were considered to be Gods, but see what was the reality later
 tanushri ne kaha ki ve is maamle par abhi bhi nahin bolnaa chaahati thi, lekin jab intervyuu ke dauraan ek jarnlist ne unase mitu ko lekar sawaal kiya to unhen apane saath hue is vaakye kaa zikr karnaa padaa
 Let me tell you that in an interview, in 2008, Tanushree had accused him of trying to force her during the shooting of a film
 tanushri kaa kahana tha ki gane ke koreagrapher ganesh acharya, diarector rakesh saarang or produsar sami siddiki sab is baat se waakif hai, lekin kisi ne kuch nahin kiya
 What did Parganesh Acharya say about the matter? On the other hand, Acharya dismissed Tanushree's allegations and said - First of all, this is a very old incident, so i do not remember everything properly
 lekin ye dual song tha, jahaan tak mujhe yaad he us din kuch hua tha, jiske kaaran shooting teen ghante tak rukii rahi thi
 There was some misunderstanding
 lekin main ye kah saktaa hum ki ye sab galat bayaan he ki naanaa ne political party ke log bulaae the
 It did not happen
 acharya ne us baat kaa bhi khandan kiya ki ye solo song tha or naanaa isamen jabardasti aana chaahate the
 Acharya said that it was a dual song from the beginning
 naanaa iskaa hissaa the
 He said that Tanushree is misinformed that she got work in the film because of him
 acharya ne kaha, naanaa sweet person hai
 They cannot do this
 ve dusron kii madad karte hai or aise kai kalakaar hai, jinaki madad ke liye naanaa aage aae hai
 They cannot do this
 bataa den ki tanushri nenaana patekarpar 2008 main ek press conference main kai aarope lagaae the
 To which Nana said, "tanushree is of my daughter's age, i don't know why she is talking like this
" mujhe industry main 35 saal ho jaaenge kaam karte hue, lekin kisi ne bhi kabhi mere par is tarah ke aarope nahin lagaae hai
 "according to a TOI report, Tanushree had also lodged a complaint against Nana Patekar in 2008 at CINTAA for damaging her property and fame
 naanaa patekar ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane ko lekar film main tanushri ko raakhi saavant se riples bhi kar diya gaya tha

 a criminal case of intrusion has been registered
 shahar ke police adheekshak maan singh chouhan ne bataaya, ‘ham gaayab cellphone kaa pataa lagane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 It is said that on Wednesday, when the police broke the door of Professor Sirus's room and went inside, the cellphone was lying near his feet
 chouhan ne kaha ki seeras ke shav kii baramadagi ke samay rasoighar main paye gayi khaane kaa namoona jaanch ke liye le liya gaya he
 He said that the police were not ruling out any possibility regarding his death as the post mortem report had not reached any conclusion
 is bich mukhya nyaayik magistrate ke aadesh par chah logon ke khilaaf kal raat maamla darj kiya gaya
 Serus had approached the court before his suicide
 chouhan ne bataaya ki praathmiki main vishvavidhyalay ke proctor jubair khan, kulapati ke media salaahkaar pro en e ke durrani, jansampark adhikari raahat abraar or nijee news channel se jude do patrakaron samet chah logon ke naam shaamil hai

 In the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi defeated the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh
 akhilesh yadav or mayawati milakar bhi modi-shah ke vijay rath ko nahin roak sake
 After defeating the SP-BSP, the BJP has now focused their core vote bank
 party soobe main jo sadsyta abhiyaan chalaaegi, usamen focus basapa ke jatav or sapa ke yadav vot bank par zyada hoga
 The membership drive will begin on July 6, the birthday of Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee
 bijepi ke pravaktaa rakesh treepathi ne aajtak
 told that SP has used Yadav and BSP as vote bank for voters of Jatav community
 laabh yadav samudaay ke saifai kunbe se jude log hi uthaate rahe jabaki gajipur or gorakhpur kaa yadav upekshit rahaa
 Tripathi says that BJP has understood this in a better way and has made the difference to all the communities without having a gas or free electricity connection under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or Ujjwala Yojana
 isamen chaahe yadav samudaay ke log hon yaa phir jatav samaaj ke
 The result of this is that all those people are associated with the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections as voters
 aise main ham inhen bijepi sadsy or kaaryakarta banane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The BJP believes that despite good performance in UP, it did not get enough votes at minority, Jatav and Yadav dominated booths
 in boothon par sapa-basapa kaa jaateey tantra ukhaad phenkane ke liye sadsyta abhiyaan chalaaya jayega
 The BJP held conferences of different castes in Uttar Pradesh before the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ne yadav samudaay kaa bhi sammelan lakhanu main kiya tha
 Not only this, in the 2017 assembly elections, BJP had given ticket to 11 Yadavs, out of which 9 won and one was included in the cabinet in the Yogi government
 upi main yadav samudaay ke 10 fisadi vot hai or jatav 14 fisadi hai
 With these votes, the SP and the BSP have been sitting on power
 haalanki is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main sapa-basapa milakar bhi mahaj 15 siten jeet paae
 Mayawati then alleged that the Yadav community did not vote for the grand alliance
 mayawati kii yah baat yadav samudaay ko bahut khali he
 The SP leaders also believe that in this time Lok Sabha elections, the bsp's Dalit votes did not get them outright
 isi kaa nateeja he ki badaayun se dharmendra yadav, kannauj se dimple yadav or firozabad se akshay yadav chunaav haar gaye
 BJP wants to take advantage of this rift between SP and BSP
 gharelu bazaar main blueberi phone ke kaamyaab ho jane ke baad canadai company research in moshan (rim) ne teji se bad rahe tablet pisi bazaar main bhi kadam rakh diya he
 On Wednesday, the company launched its tablet personal computer 'playbook', which will compete with Apple's ipad and Samsung's Galaxy Tab
 'plabook' ko america bazaaron main pehle hi launch kiya ja chukaa he
 RIM has launched three models of 'playbook' in India

 In terms of size, the blackberry 'playbook' is much smaller than the ipad, and is only seven inches in size, while the ipad 9
 7 inch kaa he
 The 'playbook' touchscreen is also quite good, although blackberry has used its own operating system in 'playbook'
 'plabook' main do hai-definishan camere lage hai
 The front part of the handset has a three-megapixel camera, while the rear has a five-megapixel camera
 'plabook' flash saport karata he, jisase internet kii raftaar bhi bad jaati he, or yah feechar ypad main nahin he
 The 'playbook' also has a 3G SIM card slot
 haalanki, 'plabook' ko sirf blueberi phone ke saath hi joda ja saktaa he, or 'plabook' ko bluetooth ke jariye peyar karaane ke liye blueberi brij naamak software kii jarurat padati he
 Aditya Thackeray, who is the third generation of Thackeray family, has filed nomination papers from Worli seat, Bharwarli seat is considered to be the stronghold of Shiv Sena, today is a historic day in Shiv Sena's 52-year political journey
 'thakare parivaar' ke teen pidiyon kii raajnneeti main ye pehali baar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ke bete aditya thakare chunaav main kismat aajamaane utre hai
 Aditya filed nomination papers from Worli assembly seat in Mumbai
 mumbai ke bandra ilaake main rahane vaale aditya thakare ne bandra seat chunaav ladane ke bajaay varli vidhansabha kshetra se utarane ke peeche sochi samajhi ranneeti he
 That is why Sunil Shinde, sitting Shiv Sena MLA from Worli seat, has given up his claim in view of Aditya Thackeray's desire to enter the electoral fray
 yah seat shivasena ke raajnneetik uttaradhikari maane jane vaale aditya thakare ke liye kaaphi sef maani ja rahi he
 1
 shivasena kaa majboot durgamumbai kii varli vidhansabha seat shivasena kaa majboot garh mana jaataa he
 In 1990, Shiv Sena won for the first time
 iske baad yah silsilaa 2004 tak jari rahaa
 The NCP opened the account in 2009, but in 2014 the Shiv Sena once again took possession
 vidhansabha kshetra ke andar aane vaale sabhi 6 parshad shivasena ke hai
 This is the reason that Aditya Thakarene, who handles the political leadership of the Thackeray family, is getting down from the Worli seat to play the election innings
 2
 In the Lok Sabha elections, Shiv Sena comes under the larger Leadverli assembly seat Mumbai South Parliamentary seat
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shivasena saansad arvind saavant ne congress ke diggaj netaa milling devda ko ek lakh se zyada voton se haraaya tha
 The bigger thing was that Arvind Sawant got a lead of 38 thousand votes from Worli assembly constituency falling under this Lok Sabha seat
 modi sarkaar main arvind saavant kendriya mantri hai
 In such a situation, Aditya Thackeray can get a big advantage by contesting from the Worli seat
 3
 The Marathas and the elite class voter Kingmakerwarli assembly seat is in the role of the voter kingmaker of the Paramratha community
 iske alaava yah ilaaka kaaphi hai profile mana jaataa he, is ilaake main kai badi corporate company ke daftar bhi hai
 In the way Aditya Thackeray's image has been, he is able to better connect himself with the Marathi people with the elite class
 aise main shivasena elite class ke vot ko bhi hasil karne main safal rah sakati he
 4
 varli par shivasena kaa kabjawarli vidhansabha seat se maujuuda samay main shivasena ke sunil scindia vidhayak hai
 Sunil Shinde received 60625 votes in the 2014 assembly elections
 unhone NCP ke netaa or purv mantri sachin ahir ko 23 hajaar se zyada voton se maat di thi
 While BJP also fielded its candidate
 iske baavjood shivasena is seat par badi jeet darj kii thi
 Not only this, Sachin Ahir, who defeated Shiv Sena from the NCP in 2009, has recently joined the Shiv Sena, which has made the journey of Aditya Thackeray easier from Worli seat

 On the Bandra East seat, the home of Muslim voter judge Aditya Thackeray falls in the Bandra East constituency of Mumbai
 bandra east vidhansabha seat main muslim samaaj kii badi aabaadi rahati he, jo mulat: shivasena kaa voter nahin mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, when Aditya Thackeray descends from the Bandra seat, Muslim voters could be a hindrance to his victory
 shaayad isiilie liye aditya thakare ne bandra ke bajaay varli seat se utarane kaa man banaaya he

 upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne somvaar ko bijepi par pradhanmantri kaa majaak udaane kaa aarope lagaaya to mangalvaar ko iske jawaab main bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne ye aarope congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se sir madh diya
 Rajnath Singh even went on to say that Sonia Gandhi should resign from him for Rahul's behavior
 congress par nishaanaa sadhate hue rajnath singh ne kaha, 'sonia ne kaha ki puri congress party manmohan singh ke saath khadi he
 i am amazed by this statement
 kyonki piem kaa majaak bijepi ne nahin balki unheen kii party or uske upaadhyaksh ne udaaya
 Attempting Rahul Gandhi, he said, the ordinance that was passed by the Prime Minister and his cabinet
 use saarvajanik taur par rahul gandhi ne bakawaas qaraar diya
 This statement caused a shock to the pm's US tour
 jab pradhanmantri videsh gaye hon to kisi bhi party ko is tarah kaa bayaan nahin dena chahie or na hi unka apmaan karnaa chahie
 It is an insult not only to the Prime Minister but to the entire country
 'apni party kaa bachaav karte hue rajnath singh ne kaha, 'piem kaa apmaan bijepi ne nahin balki congress upaadhyaksh ne kiya
 If Sonia Gandhi is worried about this, then Rahul Gandhi should resign first and ask him to apologize in front of the whole country
 'darasal, daagi netaaon par laae gaye adhyadesh par manmohan singh ke khilaaf rahul gandhi kii khuli baghawat ke baad somvaar ko sonia gandhi ne khulkar pradhanmantri kaa samarthan kiya
 Addressing the party's rally in Mandya, Karnataka, he said that because of Manmohan Singh, the UPA government passed important bills
 puri congress party pradhanmantri ke saath khadi he
 The bill related to changing the system of appointment of judges has been challenged in the Supreme Court, which will be heard on Monday
 haal hi main sansad ne nyaayik niyukti ayog bill ko paas kiya he
 With the effect of this bill, the old collegium system for appointment of judges will end
 supreme court main janhit yachikaayen daayar kii gai hai, jinamein nyaayik niyukti ayog bill ko asanvaidhanik qaraar dene kii maang kii gai he
 Public interest petitions have stated that this bill is against the basic form of the Constitution
 yachikakartaon ke vakeelon ne aagrah kiya ki unke maamle par tatkaal sunwaayee kii jaani chahie, jis par mukhya nyaayadhish aaram lodha kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne kaha ki maamla somvaar ko sunwaayee ke liye aa rahaa he
 These petitions have been filed on behalf of former Additional Solicitor General Bishwajit Bhattacharya, advocates - RK Kapoor and Manohar Lal Sharma and Supreme Court Advocates on Record
 adhivaktaaon ne kaha ki sansad main 121waan samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak or engeesi vidheyak 2014 asanvaidhanik hai, kyonki ve samvidhan ke aadharbhoot dhaanche kaa ulanghan karte hai
 He said the constitution recognizes a clear demarcation under Article 50 separating the judiciary from the executive, which is the inherent power for a healthy judicial system
 kapur ne kaha, yahaan yah ullekh karnaa praasangik hoga ki samvidhan ke tahat diarective principles of state policy kaa anuchhed 50 na sirf nichali adaalaton par lagu he, balki shakti pruthakkakaran siddhant ke rup main ucch adaalaton par bhi lagu he tathaa nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa samvidhan kii aadharbhoot sthir vishashtita he
 Bhattacharya argued that the Constitution empowers the Chief Justice to decide in each appointment of judges of the Supreme Court and High Court and in the transfer of judges from one High Court to another
 unhone kaha, yah shakti ab engeesi ko sthanantarit kii ja rahi he or ucchtam nyaayalay ke do varishthatam nyaayadhishon ke saath pradhan nyaayadhish ko karypalika dwaara vito kiye jane kii sambhaavna nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa or shakti pruthakkakaran ke siddhant
 
 
 Both of these basic features of the Indian Constitution would be fatal
 rajyasabha ne 14 agast ko 121wein samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak or engeesi vidheyak ko manjuuri de di thi
 a day before this, the Lok Sabha also approved them
 loksabhaa ne vidheyak ko congress dwaara sujhaaye gaye or sarkaar dwaara sweekaar kiye gaye mahatvapurn sanshodhan ke saath paarit kar diya tha

 It is another matter that Vengsarkar has played more than 100 Test matches and Anurag Thakur has only one first class match
 
 
 vah bhi sidhe captain banakar
 2
 isliye usee saal adhyaksh rahete hue vah ek din maidan pahunche or elaan kar diya ki vah us match main na keval team main khelenge balki vah us team kii captaini bhi karenge
 Whoever spoke, he dies, that's why no one rejected Anurag Thakur's words
 3
 He played in that match against Jammu and Kashmir, but could not even open his account with the bat
 vah 7 gend tak maidan par rahe lekin ek bhi ran nahin bana paae
 However, in bowling, he saved the entire embarrassment by dismissing two tail batsmen
 tippaniyan 4
 himachal pradesh main cricket baikfoot par aa gaya lekin anuraag thakur kaa bisisiai main safar shuru ho gaya
 Now he became a first-class player and that is why he first became a selector in junior cricket and then became the biggest official of BCCI with his political influence
 5
 According to the affidavit that the BCCI filed in the Supreme Court in the month of March, Anurag Thakur has been a big cricketer like Dilip Vengsarkar, Shivlal Yadav and Brajesh Patel who is now working to groom BCCI Indian cricket
 yah or baat he ki vengsarakar ne 100 se zyaada test match khele hai or anuraag thakur ne sirf ek first class match
 
 
 That too by becoming captain directly

 Cricket came to the backfoot in Himachal Pradesh but Anurag Thakur started his journey in BCCI
 ab vah pratham shrenee ke khilaadi ban chuke the or isiilie vah pehle junior cricket main chayankarta bane or phir apane rajnatik rasookh ke sahare bisisiai ke sabase bade adhikari ban gaye hai

 Mind Rocks Session: first-time Voters, How to Choose Your People's Representative Speakers: Deepender Hooda, Sanjay Kaul, Arvind Kejriwal is said to be playing an important role in the upcoming assembly and Lok Sabha elections, which have recently turned 18 and for the first time Will use the franchise
 india today mind rox summit-2013 main pehali baar ke votaron kii bhoomika or jimmedaari par baat kii congress saansad deependra hooda, aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal or bijepi pravaktaa sanjay kaul ne
 Let's know the opinion of all three
 deependra hooda: kejariwal or BJP bhi desh ko aage le janaa chaahate handuniya bhar ke yuvaaon main satta or tantra ke prati asantosh he
 They want a strong, decision-making leadership
 hamane kya kiya
 What happened after 47? ek samvidhan bana he
 Every man got the right to vote
 aazaadee ke paanch saal ke bheetar desh main pehle aam chunaav hue
 The per capita income in the year 47 was Rs 237
 aaj 68 hajaar he
 Life rate, literacy rate have increased
 bharat jaise vividhta bhare desh ko baandhna, sanbhaalanaa or ek sutara main baandhna, yah sab pandit ji or sardaar patel ke prayaason se hua
 Rajiv ji reduced the voter's age to 18 years instead of 21 years
 panchayat raaj laayaa gaya
 Green Revolution brought
 white revolgaushan laayaa gaya
 We have done magar ye sawaal bhi jaij he ki kya ham or nahin kar sakate the
 We have been in power for 9 years
 pichley 9 saal main 7
 The average GDP has been 9 percent
 iconmi teen guna ho gai he
 The way poverty has decreased in the last seven years
 vah puri duniya main ek record he
 China could not do this either
 masalaa ye he ki hamen koun sa model, koun sa tarika chunanaa he
 Some people grow fast
 or sabakaa aankada sudhar jayega
 Or should everyone be concerned, such a system should be created
 aaj desh main rajnatik bahes kaa maahaul nahin rahaa
 Hey we can be different in ideology
 magar dushman nahin hai
 i respect Arvind Kejriwal who came in the political process
 aap hon yaa bijepi sabhi is desh ko aage le janaa chaahate hai
 i cannot give political greetings to Kejriwal
 magar nijee taur par ye badhai de saktaa hum ki vah maidan main aae
 Daru Song 'ek Gilaasi' made on the request of the mother: Hard Kaursanjaya Kaul: True work and real mango, the common man does not get so much said by Deendar Sahab
 itani tarif kii
 How to do evil
 itnaa meetha daal do ki funs jaae
 Men, they are good
 magar party ke liye yah sab nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He says that we are all together
 to phir sansad main jhagada kyon hota he
 Why do you tell us communal? agar sabaki niyat thik he, to vah hota kyon nahin jo hona chahie
 It is a matter of studies
 koi nahin kahegaa ki sabko rhite tu ajukeshan hona chahie
 Who will dispute this? magar ye kyon nahin hua
 So Hooda sir, it is not enough that your intentions and gestures are correct
 jaruri he ki aapkaa model thik ho
 It is important that you can decide
 desh kii dasha ye he ki pehle to naukari milti nahin
 If you get it, it doesn't last
 uniwarsity nai bananaa to dur, jo hai vah badtar hoti ja rahi hai
 It is reported in the newspaper that it is such a student of the college, he got a job of so many crores
 bahadur jyoti kii tasviir dekhegaa desh, maa boleen-meri beti ne kuch galat nahin kiya, kyon chhipaaen shaklsccha kaam or asli aam to aam aadmi ko miltaa nahin
 So the result of that is Mr
 Kejriwal
 unki aam aadmi party
 Now they put their hands on their hands and say it with love yaar tum aa jaao
 i also said yaar main aa to jaataa, par tum nikaal nahin paaoge
 i tied up all my thoughts and chose a party
 har party main achche bure log hai
 The system goes very deep
 to badlaav ke liye gahare tak jaakar badalanaa hoga
 i am also angry magar main chahta hum ki uskaa nateeja dikhe
 You need to work with a party that has a leader like Narendra Modi
 jo kahe so kare
 If you cannot, then honestly say that it did not happen
 magar aage kar lenge
 Arvind Kejriwal: i am giving the guarantee of honesty to my candidate (as soon as he shouts slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Inquilab Zindabad and Vande Mataram in a loud voice) Deepender Hooda said very well that the intention of Arvind Kejriwal's party is clear
 
 ham khush hai ki vah ise sweekaar karte hai
 He said the views are different
 ham sahamat hai
 At one time, Patel, Gandhi and Shastri decided the ideology of the Congress
 magar aaj congress kii vichaardhaara robert wadra tay karte hai
 The ideology of BJP in Delhi is decided by Vijay Goel and hence the common man had to form his own party
 anna ji do saal pehle kya maang rahe the
 Such a Jan Lokpal bill that punishes the corrupt
 13 din ke anshan ke baad sari partiyon ne kaha ki aap khatm kar do
 We will pass the bill
 maine aaj tak auraton ko danga karte nahin dekha: kiran bediaaj do saal ho gaye
 The PM cheated
 sansad main baithe sab dalon ne dhokhaa diya
 Weak Lokpal was also unable to bring it
 sab darate hai
 All parties are afraid
 congress, bijepi, mayawati, jayalalita har party ne chori kar rakhi he
 If Anna passes the Lokpal today, more than half of the leaders will be in Tihar
 ek sapana sach hone ja rahaa he
 In November, the Aam Aadmi Party is going to win the elections with an overwhelming majority
 jeetne ke 15 din ke bheetar vahi lokapal bill paas hoga, jiske liye anna ne, aap sabane andolan kiya tha
 Nowadays we are standing candidates
 sab poochhate hai ki arvind aap eemaandaar hai
 But what do you guarantee for 70 candidates? main de rahaa hum guarantee
 Leander Paes, who spoke in mindrocks, wanted to become a footballer as a child, 16 Congress mlas and 9 BJP mlas are sitting
 jin par hatya or balaatkaar ke mukademe chal rahe hai
 That is why the Aam Aadmi Party is giving tickets to good people by electing them
 magar ho saktaa he ki kuch gadabad ho jaae
 If even a day before someone brings evidence against aap's candidate, then we will not let him contest the election
 seat khaali chhod denge, magar dalal ko nahin jaane denge vidhayika main
 When i joined politics, people said that there are mud
 logon ne kaha ki anna ko dhokhaa diya maine
 i did not cheat
 meri unase bahes hui
 i said everything and tried it
 kuch nahin hua
 Will have to go to the system
 anna ne kaha keechad he
 We said no one, maybe if we want to sacrifice it, then we will also respect it
 jab nehru patel raajnneeti karte the
 If someone went into politics, people used to say that the country is going to serve
 aaj agar koi aisa kahe to log kehete hai ki paisa kamaane dallali karne ja rahaa he
 Doing politics is a very sacred thing
 maine dilli main anshan kiya
 Said that if our government is formed then electricity bill will be reduced by 50 percent
 bijepi ne kaha 30 fisadi kam karenge
 a journalist friend jokingly said that Goyal cannot reduce 50
 20 fisadi unka hissaa bhi he
 We have tied our fists and all have tied
 magar desh dekh rahaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal makes great things
 aapke logon par bhi aarope lage
 Kejriwal: The government belongs to the Congress BJP
 sab jaanch karvaa chuke hai
 They did not get anything
 ye baar baar kehete rahe ki videsh se fund aata he
 He said in the court that money is coming from abroad
 phir red maari
 The last one had to say that no money is coming from outside
 desh ko faisla karne vaala netaa chahie
 People are angry with Manmohan
 rahul bhi saamne nahin aate, aapke leader main bhukh najar nahin aati
 Deepender Hooda: Every person's way of working varies
 pichley saat aath varsh main mujhe najadik se rahul ji ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 And i can say that my commitment to ideology, i have seen it in very few people
 uske saath vah apane vichaar ko ant tak pahunchane ke liye jis tarah sabko lekar chalate hai
 Rahul ji's ideology for the farmers, for the poor
 modi ke bare main kuch kaa maananaa he ki jo apni party ko unite nahin kar paaya, vah desh kya chalaaegaa
 So why do you believe that Modi will be able to run the country
 sanjay:aapkaa fih sawaal galat he
 If there was talk of unity in the party 15 days ago, it was fine
 ab sab party ne ek saath tay kiya he
 Do not forget that for the first time after the debate at every level of the party organization, Narendra Modi's name was decided
 aapako ise celibratt karnaa chahie
 Where the matter is about Rahul, whenever something seems to be right, then all the chorus starts singing their songs
 jahaan gadabad hoti he, to samuhik jimmedaari kii baat hone lagati he
 Difference in popularity of Rahul Gandhi and Modi? Deepender Hooda: Rahul Gandhi is ahead in the vote of girls and they are more intelligent
 hamaari or unki vichaardhaara main fark he
 We want development to benefit everyone
 ham india shining nahin chaahate
 We want to build India
 isi vichaardhaara ke paksh main logon ne lagaataar do baar se hamen janadesh diya he
 Today i want to ask you the question that Gujarat talks about development
 sabase kam dihadi detaa he majdoor ko
 We talk about that worker
 chintaa karte hai
 Dynasty is in politics, you also have it? Deepender Hooda: The system of politics
 usamen agar aap rajnatik family se aate hon to adwantage mil jaataa he
 i was a professional when i first contested
 ejineering kii
 Worked for Infosys
 pehali baar chunaav ladaa to sava do lakh voton se jeeta
 The father won in the name of Dada
 saadhe teen saal baad chunaav hue
 i went to the public saying that if something is done, then live by one vote
 mujhe paune paanch lakh voton se jitayaa gaya
 So those who have come through dynasty have to prove themselves to the public
 film 'ankhon dekhi' kii kahani puraani dilli ke ek parivaar kii he, jo anokhe hai, niraale hai
 It is not just a film, but a thought, the experience of colors of human life and the happiness of conscience
 babuji kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe sanjay mishra kii bhi ek soch he, jiske mutabik vah jis cheez ko dekhte hai, usee par vishwaas karte hai
 Sanjay Mishra, who usually made the audience laugh, has given his life in the character of Babuji
 unki patni ke role ko seemaa paahwa ne parde par jiya he
 All the characters, big and small, are excellent in their roles
 aamtaur par jab bhi filmon main dilli ko dekhte hai, usamen punjabiyon kii dilli najar aati he, magar diarector rajat kapur ne asli puraani dilli ko bahut hi khubsuurati se darshaya he
 Within the theater for two hours, i felt that i was really present among a family in Old Delhi
 unke jhagade, unki bahes, unke ghar hui shaadi or unke jajbaton main main shaamil hua
 Every person's thinking and understanding is different, i am also included in them
 
 
 yah mumkin he ki 'ankhon dekhi' ko dekhne ke baad jo maine sochaa, vah dusron kii soch se alag ho
 In the film, there have been repeated attempts to believe the experiences of life in our eyes, but my thinking while watching the film kept asking questions to what extent any human being can go for his happiness

 kaha jaataa he ki is maang ko maanane ke liye punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh taiyaar nahin honge
 The Captain does not like Sidhu stepping out of his jurisdiction

 The official said, 'it is suspected that these people and units have kept unspent money in Swiss banks through trusts, domiciliary companies and other illegal units outside India
 'nahin bataaenge naam or rakam?haalanki, adhikari ne in logon yaa ikaayiyon or unki jamaa rakam ke bare main nahin bataaya
 The official declined to provide details citing confidentiality provisions and a bilateral information exchange treaty between the two countries
 adhikari ne aage kaha ki swiss adhikari bharat kii nai sarkaar ke saath najdiki se kaam karne ko taiyaar hai or ve kaale dhan par navgathit vishesh jaanch team (esaiti) ko har jaruri sahyog denge
 However, the official rejected claims that Indian money deposited in Swiss banks amounted to thousands of billions of dollars

 The Swiss government has been consistently refusing to provide details of Indians based on the list of HSBC
 yah suchi ek bank karmchaaree ne churaai thi or baad main yah bharat sahit anya deshon ke kar adhikariyon ke paas pahunch gai
 Despite India's repeated requests, Switzerland refused to provide information, stating that its local law prohibits the giving of information on the basis of information obtained illegally

 It is noteworthy that Murali Vijay missed out on a century by just one run in the second innings of the Adelaide Test, and with his dismissal, the Indian innings leading to victory faltered, so during the Brisbane Test, Murali may have got his The mistake was realized, so he aimed to stay on the wicket from the beginning of the innings
 haalanki is dauraan kismat ne bhi unka bakhubi saath diya, lekin murali kaa iraadaa wicket par tikne kaa bana rahaa or isi kii badaulat murali ne apane test kariyar kaa paanchvaan shatak puraa kiya

 short pich gendon ko khilne main unki mushkil bhi rah-rahakar saamne aa jaati he, lekin murali kii ballebaazi kii badi khaasiyat he ki vah wicket par tike hon, to ran apane aap aate hai
 Team India needs a similar opener in Test matches, as such batsmen have their own importance in Tests, and that is why Murali Vijay continues to be a regular in the Test team despite his age
 kuch maheene pehle jab england main bharat ke diggaj ballebaaz chaltau andaaj main simat rahe the, tab murali vijay ne nottingham main ek joardaar shatak banaaya tha
 Earlier, all three Test centuries were scored against Australia, but only on home ground

 His century in Brisbane after scoring half-centuries in both innings of Adelaide suggests that Team India will not have to worry about the opening in this series

 pakistan ke saath seemaa par badhate tanaav ke bich tamaam logon kii ore se pakistan ke saath khel sambandhon ko khatm karne kii maang bhi tej ho rahi he
 In such a situation, what has been said by Sports Minister Vijay Goel till date
 pakistan ke saath hockey khilne ko lekar faisla federation kaa- vijay goyalesian championships toffee main shanivaar ko bharat or pakistan ke bich hone vaale hockey match ke bare main mantri vijay goyal kaa kahana he jaahir he jab tanaav hota he donon deshon ke bich to usne kai baar yah sambhav nahin hota
 Everyone depends on what the atmosphere is like in front of us
 jis par faisla karnaa he
 Should not play games with Pakistan
 iske bare main main kuch nahin kah saktaa
 Because when there will be a tournament, when there will be a match
 is par depend karata he
 Vijay Goyal also says that we cannot say immediatly that we have a match in front of us
 ek baat samaj lijie jab timen participet kar rahi hai toornament main or agar chaar timen kwalifai kar gai hai
 If it belongs to India and Pakistan too, then obviously if you do not play, then you have to come out of it then it becomes a bit difficult
 agar van-tu-van he aap usamen jarur nirnay kar sakate hai ki aapako khelnaa he yaa nahin khelnaa he
 On playing with Pakistan, Vijay Goel says that it is not just our ministry
 yah federation kaa maamla he
 It is to dissuade them
 Whenever we play with a foreign team, the Ministry of External Affairs, Home Ministry and other Concern Ministries are involved in it and all decide together
 akele nahin faisla hota
 Regarding Pakistani actors working in films, Vijay Goel says that the way the atmosphere inside the country is such that till Pakistan does not eliminate terrorism
 tab tak pakistan ke saath rishte nahin rah sakate hai
 In such a situation there is no cultural exchange with them
 aisa hi chalata rahaa to jaahir taur par yah sab chijen bhi to mushkil ho jaati hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, no Namaz or Aarti will be performed on the streets
 uttar pradesh police meerut or aligarh main safal prayog ke baad ab is model ko puure rajya main lagu karegi
 Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) OP Singh said in a special conversation on this issue from today that he wants both Namaz and Aarti on the road to be amicably stopped, so that the common people are not inconvenienced
 unhone kaha ki sadak par namaaj nahin hogi, isaki shuruyaat hamane meerut se kii or baad main iskaa prayog aligarh main bhi kiya gaya
 This experiment was successful
 unhone kaha ki loktantr main jab logon ko jodakar koi faisla liya jaataa he to uskaa asar hota he
 This is what has happened
 unhone bakreed or kanvad yatra ke sauhardpurn tareeke se sampann hone kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki hamane donon pakshon ko bulaakar baat kii or ek rasta nikaala
 If the Muslims left half way for the Kanwari, then the Kanwadi also kept the DJ sound low
 dijipi ne kaha ki jab yah prayog bhi safal rahaa to hamen laga ki ham isko puure pradesh main lagu kar sakate hai
 It may not be fully implemented during some festivals, but on normal days we will try to implement it
 unhone kaha ki ham chahenge ki jo bheed he, chaahe namaaj kii ho yaa aarti kii, vah daayre se baahar na jaae
 There is no obstruction in traffic
 isi ke maddenjar hamane yah faisla liya he
 Namaz will not be banned DGP OP Singh said that there will be no restriction on Namaz
 masjidon ke baahar sadak par jo log aa jate hai, ham chahenge ki sakaaratmak tareeke se is par pahal ho or sadak par namaaj na ho
 Dismissing public speculation about this decision, he said that this experiment was very successful in Aligarh and Meerut during Eid
 logon ne ise saharsha sweekaar kiya
 Applicable to every religious custom, the DGP of Uttar Pradesh said that it should be applicable not only to Namaz but to all religious customs
 vah chaahe aarti ho yaa phir namaaj
 These should be legal rules
 unhone kaha ki bakreed main hamane intensive pulising kii
 We made it clear that cows and camels would not be cut
 iskaa shat-pratishat paalan hua
 People also believed it
 gauratlab he ki kuch shaharon main sadakon par namaaj kaa virodh karte hue kuch sanghathanon ne sadakon par aarti kaa aayojan karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi

 Reacting to this appeal earlier, Abdullah said in July that it should be left to the conscience of the mps to decide if he wanted to take the gasoline gas subsidy

 ) Telecom sector veteran Sunil Bharti Mittal said on Saturday that India should also ban Facebook and Google simply because they are both American companies
 mittal ne kaha ki unhen america sangrakshanvaad se bahut chintaa nahin hai kyonki unka bijness puri tarah bhartiya bazaar par aadhaarit he, lekin jab videshi companiyaan bharat main bada munafa kama rahi hon to bhartiya kamgaaron ko america jane se rokna bilkul galat he
 In fact, America has become more protectionist under Trump's leadership
 gauratlab he ki mittal ne kaha, 'agar aapke saamne aise halaat paidaa ho jate hai ki arthvyavastha ko gati denevaale kushal kamgaaron ke pravesh par hi pabandi laga di jaae yaa bhartiya companiyon ko sirf isliye ek khaas selary dene ke liye majaboor kiya jaae taaki wo un deshon main pratispardhaa ke laayak hi nahin bachein to mujhe lagata he ki yah un companiyon ke khilaaf anuchit karrwai he jo america main vyapaar karnaa chaahati hai
 'actually, Mittal was asked what would be his reaction if his company Airtel was not given entry in a particular country? On this question, Mittal gave the example of Google, Facebook and whatsapp which have crores of users in India
 inkaa hawala dete hue mittal ne poocha ki kya in companiyon ko bharat main tab bhi sanchaalan kii anumati milani chahie jabaki isi tarah ke ap bhartiya companiyon ke bhi hon?sunil bharti mittal ne kaha ki, 'jahaan ek taraf to fasebuk ke 20 karod, watsap ke 15 karod or google ke 10 karod customer hai bharat main, to kya hamen yah kahana chahie ki ham fasebuk or google kaa bharat main sanchaalan nahin chaahate kyonki hamaare paas khud ke eps hai
 'mittal said that in view of the large number of consumers, India is a big market for technology companies
 pichley kuch hafton se america, singapore, australia jaise desh apane vija niyamon ko kadaa karne main jute hai
 It is feared that it may have a negative impact on the cost of those Indian IT companies who send their employees on visas of these countries to serve their customers

 Especially the states of South India are strongly opposing it
 buudhvaar ko andhra pradesh ke vittamantri yanmala ramkrishnudu ne maamle ko lekar ek baar phir se centre kii modi sarkaar kii tikhi aalochana kii he
 He said that today BJP is in power and tomorrow another party will be in power
 haalanki yah myne nahin rakhata ki koun satta main hai, lekin samvidhan ke mul dhaanche kaa ulanghan katai nahin kiya janaa chahie
 During this, he also said that each state has a responsibility to protect its rights
 sabhi partiyon ko apni politics ko alag karke is masale par ek saath aawaaj buland kerani chahie
 The Andhra Pradesh Finance Minister said that the terms and conditions of the 15th Finance Commission should be discussed nationwide
 agar isko aise hi hu-ba-hu lagu kiya jaataa he, to isse pragatisheel rajya buree tarah prabhavit honge
 He termed these terms and conditions of the Finance Commission as a big conspiracy to damage the basic financial structure of the states
 Today, there's BJP in power, tomorrow others might come
 No matter who's in power, the basic structure of constitution mustn't be violated
 Responsibility is on every state to protect its rights
 All parties must respond on the issue keeping their politics aside: Andhra Finance Min — ANI (@ANI) May 9, 2018 Ramakrishnudu said that it will cause loss of one lakh 14 thousand 62 crore to Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Odisha and Karnataka 
 unhone kaha ki is babat hamane centre sarkaar se vitt mantriyon ke conklev yojit karne kii apil kii thi, lekin dukh kii baat yah he ki modi sarkaar kii ore se iskaa koi jawaab nahin diya gaya
 The central government should not deprive states of their rights under any circumstances

 Naidu had said that if the 2011 census is made the basis for the disbursement of central funds, the progressive states that control their populations will suffer
 unhone kaha ki centre ko sahakaarita ke sangheey dhaanche kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 Many states demand that the funds be distributed according to the 1971 census
 naidu ne kaha tha ki saal 2011 kii janaganana ke aadhaar par kendriya kosh kaa vitaran karke aabaadi niyantran main aage rahane vaale rajyon ko dandit karnaa uchit nahin hoga
 We will not tolerate this injustice
 ham nyaay hasil karne tak sangharsh karenge
 He had said that Kerala is ahead of all states in population control
 andhra pradesh ne bhi jansankhya niyantran ke liye kadam uthaae hai
 If the constituencies are delimited according to the 2011 population, the states of South India will lose seats
 andhra pradesh ke alaava puducheri, pashchim bengal, punjab, kerala or dilli bhi15wein vitt ayogke niyamon or sharton ke virodh main hai
 In protest against this, former Union Finance Minister p Chidambaram has welcomed the protests lodged by these six states and union territories
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki duusare rajyon ko bhi 15wein vitt ayog ke niyamon or sharton kaa virodh karnaa chahie
 These states argue that the allocation of funds on the basis of the 2011 census will benefit those states which have failed to contain the growing population
 aaj deshbhar main id-ul-ajaha (bakreed) kaa tyohaar bade harshollas ke saath manaaya ja rahaa he
 According to Islamic belief, eid-ul-juha is celebrated in remembrance of the sacrifice of Hazrat Ibrahim
 id-ul-ajaha ke maukey par muslim dharm main namaaj padhane ke saath-saath jaanwaron kii qurbaani bhi di jaati he
 According to Islam, people of Muslim religion make sacrifices for the King of Allah
 haalanki islam main sirf halaal ke tareeke se kamaaye hue paison se hi qurbaani jaij maani jaati he
 Let us know why the sacrifice is paid on Bakrid and why the meat of the sacrifice is not kept with us
 islam main qurbaani kaa mahatv-islam main qurbaani kaa bahut bada mahatv bataaya gaya he
 According to the Quran it is said that Allah once tried to test Hazrat Ibrahim
 unhone hazrat ibrahim ko hukum diya ki vah apni sabase pyaari cheez ko unhen qurbaan kar den
 Hazrat Ibrahim was loved most by his son Hazrat Ismail
 allaah ke hukum ke baad hazrat ibrahim ne ye baat apane bete hazrat ismil ko bataai
 Please tell, Hazrat Ibrahim was blessed with a child at the age of 80
 jiske baad unke liye apane bete kii qurbaani dena behad mushkil kaam tha
 But Hazrat Ibrahim chose to sacrifice the son, choosing the command of Allah from the command of Allah and the love of the son
 hazrat ibrahim ne allaah kaa naam lete hue apane bete ke gale par chhuri chalaa di
 But when he opened his eyes, he saw that his son is standing next to him and in his place a goat-like animal is sliced and lying
 jiske baad allaah kii raah main qurbaani dene kii shuruuaat hui
 Cannot keep a whole meat of sacrifice - in Islam, no family can keep a sacrifice for itself
 qurbaani ke gosht ke teen hisse kiye jate hai
 The first part of which is for the poor
 doosraa hissaa dost or rishtedaaron ke liye or teesraa hissaa apane ghar ke liye hota he
 Why stone is killed on the devil - Islam also has a unique tradition of stoning the devil after reaching sacrifice on the last day of Haj pilgrimage to Ramizamrat
 kaha jaataa he ki yah parampara hazrat ibrahim se judi hui he
 It is believed that when Hazrat Ibrahim went to offer the sacrifice of his son to Allah, Satan tried to seduce him on the way
 yahi vajah he ki hajayatri shaitan ke pratik un teen khambhon par pathar kii kankadiyaan maarthe hai
 To whom does the law of sacrifice apply to the person who has the status of sacrifice, in true Islam
 jo shaks haisiyatmand hote hue bhi allaah kii raja main qurbaani nahin karata he wo gunaahagaaron main shumaar hota he
 How many people can give together
 There are different parts when choosing animals to sacrifice an animal
 jahaan bade jaanavar ( bhens ) par saat hisse hote hai to vahiin bakre jaise chote jaanwaron par mahaj ek hissaa hota he
 It means that if a person sacrifices a buffalo or a camel, then seven people can be included in it
 vahiin bakre kii karaata he to wo sirf ek shaks ke naam par hota he
 How the animal is sacrificed - In Islam, it is permissible to sacrifice only those animals who are healthy
 agar jaanavar ko kisi bhi tarah kii koi beemaari yaa takalif ho to allaah aise jaanavar kii qurbaani se raji nahin hota he
 The Government of Madhya Pradesh is getting entangled in controversial issues one after the other
 jal satyagraiyon ke mudde se peechha chuta bhi nahin tha ki 21 sitambar ko budgh kii gyaan prapti ke 2,600 saal puure hone ke maukey par sanchi main hone ja rahaa kaarykram abhi se vivaadon main funs gaya
 In fact, the foundation of the Buddhist Study Center is to be laid in this program, for which Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been specially invited
 isi kaa tamil netaa kadaa virodh kar rahe hai kyonki unka maananaa he ki srilanka main tamilbhaashi logon kii hatya ke jimmedaar rajpakshe hai
 The center is being set up on a hundred acres of land in Sanchi by the Government of India and Sri Lanka, the Government of Madhya Pradesh and the Mahabodhi Society
 lagbhag 200 karod ru
 The cost center will serve as a major center of education for the people of Buddhist community and will be called Sanchi University of Buddhism
 is mahatvakankshi project par vivaadon kaa saaya tabhi se padane laga jabase loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne rajpakshe kii bhopal yatra kii ghoshnaa kii
 MDMK leader Vaiko, who has always been a voice for Tamil interests in Sri Lanka, expressed surprise at the announcement saying, "rajapaksa is responsible for killing Tamil people in Sri Lanka
 yah maamla tamilnadu ke aam logon kii bhaawanaaon se judaa hua he
 This is a serious issue
 jiske chalate rajpakshe ko kaarykram main shaamil nahin hone dena chahie
 "vaiko has written a letter to Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan demanding that Rajapaksa be prevented from participating in Sanchi's program, as well as warning that if he did not do so, he would join Sanchi with his many supporters
 Upon reaching, they will oppose Rajapaksa
 unke mutabik tamilnadu se 3,000 se zyada tamil sanchi pahunchenge or rajpakshe ko kaale jhande dikhaaenge
 Other parties in Tamil Nadu have also started raising their voice against Rajapaksa's visit to Bhopal
 diemke pramukh karunanidhi ne do took shabdon main kaha, “rajpakshe kii prastaavit yatra kaa virodh karne vaale logon ke saath hum
 "not giving much importance to all the warnings, the state's Culture Minister Laxmikant Sharma said that the program will not be changed in spite of the protestant's tone
 unhone kaha, “kaarykram kii taiyaariyaan lagbhag puri ho chuki hai or ham mehmaanon ke swaagat ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar hai
 "parties with opposing ideologies are seen standing together on this issue
 pradesh congress pravaktaa maanak agarwal ne rajpakshe kii yatra ko lekar apana paksh rakhte hue kaha, “srilanka ke raashtrapati kaa ham swaagat karte hai or hamen unki madhya pradesh yatra se na to koi dikkat he or na hi ham iskaa virodh karenge
 "the Buddhist society, which is at the center of this entire program, is unhappy with the controversies surrounding the study center
" budghistha sosayadi of india ke rajya sanyojak mohanlal patil kehete hai, “virodh kaa yah tarika thik nahin he
 The Buddhist society will not support any protests against Rajapaksa in Sanchi
 patil ke shabdon main “vico agar rajpakshe kaa virodh karnaa hi chaahate hai to iske liye sanchi sahi jagah nahin he
 They should go to Delhi and register their protest
 rajpakshe achche kaam ke liye aa rahe hai or hamen unka swaagat karnaa chahie
 "apart from Rajapaksa, many high profile people from other countries are going to participate in this program
 jaise ki bhutan ke pradhanmantri lunpo jigme thinaley or china, israel, britain, france, indonesia, japan sahit kai deshon ke darshanik bhi yahaan aaenge
 In such a case, a slight omission can spoil the image of India in the world
 isliye pradesh sarkaar puri ehtiyaat barat rahi he
 One reason for this is the assembly elections going to be held in 2013
 shivaraj sarkaar ke haath sunaharaa mauka laga he jab vah khud cobaudgh hitaishi sabit kar sakati he
 The Congress also does not want to be left behind in wooing the voters
 That is why it is adding tone to the BJP

 Police claim - no bullet injury ab hindi filmon main visham paristhitiyon se jujhate nayak najar nahin aate lekin bollywood abhinayta salmaan khan aise nayakon kii bade parde par vaapasi chaahate hai
 Salman, who has given two successive successive films like 'wanted' and 'dabangg', says that he is making a conscious effort to return to heroism on screen
 salmaan ne kaha, yah un nayakon ko parde par waapas laane kaa sachet prayaas he, kyonki main lambey samay se unki kami mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 i want to go to the theater, then i want to see my hero there
 hamen isaki aadat ho gai thi, lekin ab romance pradhan filmein banane se nayak gaayab ho gaye hai
 i am in the film business, so i can bring them back
 salmaan kehete hai ki jab unhone 'dabang' banane kaa nirnay liya, to logon ne unke is faisle ko galat bataaya tha
 He said, 'dabangg' was made for the common people
 ime iske sheershak ko lekar bahut hatotsahit kiya gaya tha
 People said that not everyone will be able to pronounce this title correctly or they will not know its meaning
 nayak ke ek pulicekarmi hone, navdith abhinetri, navdith nirdeshak ke chalate logon kaa maananaa tha ki film nahin chalegi or ham barbaad ho jaaenge
 When 'dabangg' was shown, people liked it very much and all the doubts raised about it proved to be useless
 ab darshakon ko salmaan kii 'ready' or 'bodyguard' ke pradarshan kaa intjaar he
 Both are Hindi versions of South Indian films
 'ready' isi naam se 2008 main ai telugu film par aadhaarit he

 Modi had requested JDU national president and NDA convenor Sharad Yadav to support his wife as an independent candidate in view of Singh's contribution to the formation and strengthening of the NDA

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself was leaving his seat and meeting all the leaders going to him
 magar sab kii nigaah modi or sonia gandhi kii mulaakaat par thi
 Modi went all the way to the Congress Bench and went to his seat with Congress President Sonia Gandhi to know his well being
 sonia ne piem se kaha- sab thik hesoniyane bhi usee andaaj main jawaab diya ki sab thik he
 Sonia Gandhi's health was not well for a long time

 He did not participate in the meeting of the Congress Working Committee due to his health

 Dag Dehalvi was a great Urdu poet
 unka asli nawab mirza khan tha
 It is said that he was born on 25 May 1831 in Delhi
 unke pita shamsuddin khan nawab loharu ke bhai the
 The father died when the stains were small
 baad main daag kii maa ne mughaliya sultanate ke antim badshaah bahadur shah 'zafer' ke putr mirza fakhru se shaadi kar lee
 After this, the stains started living in the Red Fort of Delhi
 yahaan daag ko har tarah kii shiksha milane lagi
 Dag also felt fond of poetry
 unhone joq ko apana guru banaaya
 To see when i will go to you, i promise you that i will pass away, for his inner poet, he chose the name Daag, and made Dehlavi, that is, Delhiwala, his own
 par daag naam shaayad unhen raas na aayaa
 His life, like his name, is full of pain, wound and eviction
 saal 1856 main mirza fakhru kii maut hone ke duusare hi saal balava shuru ho gaya
 The forced stain left Delhi, he moved to Rampur, but never forgot Delhi by heart
 sthaan parivartan kaa yah gam unhen jindagi bhar salata rahaa
 Dag Dehalvi had gone through the ravages of 1857
 dilli ke gali-mohallon main laashon kaa nazaaraa unhone dekha tha
 There is such a mixture of pain and newness in his poetry, which after reading, it feels like being lost in it for a long time
 unki shaayari main dilli kii tahjeeb najar aati he
 The pain of losing the father at a young age, the second marriage of the mother, the love with which she loved Delhi, her interest from the same Delhi, and the love she wanted to embrace also brought her love
 
 
 daag kii zindagi or unki shaayari donon hi aise falsafon se bhari he
 i do not get to meet Zahidbandi from Aashiqui, a singer named Munnibai Hijab and Daag's famous love affair with Tawaif was the result of this atmosphere
 unka ishk aashikana kam, sufiana or shairana adhik tha
 Daag had lived more than half a century, when Munnibai came into his life
 daag main shaayari or soch kii gambhirtha thi to munnibai hijaab har mehfil kii jaan
 Among them was the celebration of beauty and youth
 phir ishak kii har daastaan kii tarah is ishk kii bhi ek kahani thi
 Daag has also reiterated the story of his love in Faryade Daag
 abhi ai bhi nahin kuuchaa-e-dilbar se sadaakhil gai aaj mire dil kii kali aap hi aapmunnibai hijaab se daag kaa yah ishk rangeen or sangeen donon tha
 Dag Dehalvi where Munnibai sacrificed on the beauty of Hijab and Munnibai was kind to the wealth of Hyder Ali, the younger brother of Nawab Rampur
 yon to rampur main haidadli kaa rakeeb banakar rah paanaa daag dehalavi ke liye mushkil tha, par haale dil kaa vah kya karte, muhabbat koi cheri to thi nahin ki aadesh dete hi chhod jaati
 So when the love of Munnibai Hijab started harassing him, he sent his message to Hyder Ali - 'the stain is injured by the sharp sight of Hijab
 aap ke dil bahalane ke or bhi saamaan hai, lekin daag bechaara hijaab ko na paae to kaha jaae
 'heart is not there, why does it have the strength or not, why should the patience that you have given to yourself make you look like a smile? nawab haidadli ne daag kii is gustaakhee ko na keval maaf kiya, balki unke khat kaa jawaab bhi diya, jo khud munnibai hijaab un tak lekar ai
 Nawab Hyder Ali wrote - 'daag sir, we do not have Munnibai Aziz more than your poetry
 ' lekin munnibai kii unki apni mahatvakankshaayen thi, wo ghar kii chaar deewari main nahin rah sakati thi
 She came to the stain as a hijab, but soon after leaving the stain, she came back to market
 falak detaa he jin ko aish un ko gam bhi hote hainjahan bajte hai naqkaare vahaan matam bhi hota he1887 main nawab rampur kalbe ali khan ke dehanth ke baad daag dehalavi bhi rampur main adhik samay tak nahin rah sake
 Time once again settled with him
 daag budhaape main nae sire se munasib jameen va aasmaan kii talash main nikal pade
 Many cities blew and finally he reached Hyderabad
 daag dehalavi ab tak buudhe ho chuke the
 Many diseases surrounded him
 hyderabad main daag ko paanv jamaane main saadhe teen saal se zyaada kaa samay laga
 With the help of friends, their time was being cut, but how long did this go on
 majaburi ne unhen nawab ke mahal tak pahunchaa diya
 Nawab Mehboob Ali Khan honored him and he was appointed Nawab's master
 daag dehalavi ke is rasookh va badhati haisiyat kii khabar jab munnibai hijaab ke paas pahunchi, to apane sazinde se nikaah kar chuki bai ko puraane jamaane kii yaadon ne phir se gher liya
 She divorced her husband and moved to Hyderabad near Daug Dehalvi
 munnibai hijaab jis samay hyderabad ai, daag 72 varsh ke ho chuke the
 But he did not abuse Munnibai, but adopted her again
 yah unka badppan tha yaa pyaar, pataa nahin
 Since he has been living in Laila Nai Mahmil, in the heart of whom he is crazy, he lives in Hyderabad, in 1905, Daag Dehlavi died from Faliz, and with this a great poet of Nawabi style moved from this world
 
 aaj daag dehalavi ko duniya se rukhsat hue bhale hi saal se zyada hue hon, par unki shaayari aaj bhi gunagunaai jaati he, jinda he or hameshaa hi rahegi
 It is understood that this 'stain' of the world is said to be the same grain, which did not listen to the heart sanyukt raashtra main pakistan kii doot ne kaha he ki pakistan ke saath vyapak vaarta behaal karne ke liye bharat aage nahin aa rahaa he or yah ravaiya dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko saamaanya karne kii raah main baadhak he
 Maliha Lodhi, Pakistan's permanent representative to the United Nations, told a group of students and faculty members at the US Army War College last week that India suspended talks between the two countries on frivolous grounds despite a positive start after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government came to power
 And made unacceptable pre-conditions
 vishwa sanstha main pakistani mishan dwaara jari ek press vijyapti ke anusaar, lodhi ne bataaya ki 'yah ravaiyadonon deshonke bich sambandh saamaanya karne kii disha main baadhak he
 Lodhi said that elimination of terrorism, growth in the economy and creation of peaceful neighborhoods are Pakistan's top priorities including promoting peace and security in Afghanistan and normalizing relations with India based on resolution of key issues
 swara bhaskar ne padmavat dekhne ke baad iske johar ke seen par aapatti jataai thi
 She wrote an open letter to the film's director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, alleging that Bhansali presented the woman as an object in Padmavat
 swara ke is letters par shahid kapur ne pratikriya di he
 Speaking to IB Times, he said, 'yes, i know about Swara's letter
 lekin eemaandaaree se kahuun to maine ise abhi tak padhaa nahin he
 It is very long
 main in dinon kaaphi biji hum
 i don't know what the problem is
 shaayad sanjay sar se judaa koi masalaa he
 a swara answer to Swara, understand the power of Vajaina, do not spread hollow Feminism, Shahid said, i would like to say that time is not there to do all this
 padmavat puri industry kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 It also represents freedom of expression and freedom of speech
 ham is film ko darshakon tak pahunchane ke safar main kathin samay se gujarey hai
 i think writing open letter in this way is quite 'disgusting'
 lekin har vyakti ko apane vichaar rakhane or raay dene kaa aadhikaar he
 Swara said, 'bhansali ji has glorified the practice of sati and jauhar
 swara film ke jariye striyon kii pesh hui chhavi se bahut naaraaz hai
 Women are not movable
 haa mahilaon ke paas yah ang hota he lekin unke paas or bhi bahut kuch he
 Therefore, the entire life of the people should not be spent focusing on Vajina, controlling it, protecting it, keeping its purity
 'bhansaali ko swara kii latad, likhaa- auraten chalati phirti vajaina nahinvahin raasalila ke ko-riter ne apane letters main jawaab dete hue sabase pehle feminism kii paribhaasha swara bhaskar ko samajhaaii he
 He then wrote that women have vagina
 yah jivan kaa rasta he kyonki vah jivan de sakati he
 a man cannot do this despite a million attempts
 aise main donon gender kii samanta ke sawaal kaa sahi jawaab mil jaataa he
 He further wrote that many actors, filmmakers and artists feel that they will show the way to the people, giving a new definition of Feminism in modern cinema
 aise main wo haal hi ke cinema main dikhaae gaye drishyon ko yadakar sach or jhooth kaa fark samaj len
 The scene of the film shows a woman wandering the streets listening to songs from an old film in the background with alcohol in hand after being cheated by her husband / boyfriend
 ye najaara vaisaa he jaisaa ki pyaar main dhokhaa khaane ke paas purush karte hai
 So do women get the right to equality by doing so? dilli ke jamiya nagar ilaake main dindahaade lut ke iraade se aae badmaashon ne firing kar di
 During this time a man was injured by being shot

 Tampering with audio-video The question is whether anyone has tampered with audio-video of two different days? Are both days of audio-video merged? Did a section of the media deliberately play the same fake audio-video? If yes, then the biggest question is, where did this fake audio-video come from, who made it, and then who gave it to the media? Jarra-jarra was searching for ravivaar raat unamem se paanch chaatro ke jeenyu main aane or aakar khuleam apni maujuudagi kaa saboot dene ke baavjood police ab unhen giraftaar karne main hila-hawali karti najar aa rahi he
 In such a situation, the question is whether the evidence of the police has started to weaken? Or the hasty arrest of Farkhanaiya is stopping the steps of the gritty uniform
 jeenyu main 21 farvari kii der raat se lekar police kii awajahi bani hui he
 Police encamped in JNU as soon as the news of the return of 5 accused, including Omar Khalid, who was performing anti-national in the campus, returned
 darasal police umr khalid or uske saathiyon ko giraftaar karne pahunchi thi, lekin bina uniwarsity prashasan kii ijaajat ke campus main daakhil hone se bachati rahi
 The policemen who did not come to the campus do not want any haste in Omar Khalid's case and the case worsens
 udhar 22 farvari kii subah se hi jeenyu prashasan ne chaatro ke maamle main apana rukh taiyaar karne kii kavayad shuru kar di
 JNU teachers association clearly said that they do not want the police to enter the campus
 forencik test ke liye bheja gaya videois silsile main teachers association ne vaais chancelar se mulaakaat kiya or visi ne teachers association ko aashwaasan diya he ki police ko campus main nahin aane diya jayega
 Apart from this, JNU Security's shot video has been sent by JNU Administrator for forensic test, Teachers Association has demanded the removal of the Registrar accusing VC of giving false information
 chaatro ko manjuur jeenyu prashasan kaa faisladilli pulicene exiaar main 5 chaatro par desh virdohi kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 These students are Omar Khalid, Anirban, Ashutosh, Anant and Rama Naga
 in paanchon ke campus main laut aane ke baad se police ne ek asipi ko visi se milane bheja, lekin aropiyon kii giraftaar par koi hal nahin niklaa
 At the same time, the accused students have said that they are ready to accept any decision of governance
 umr khalid par aarope laga he ki usne sirf jeenyu main hi nahin balki 18 alag-alag uniwarsity main deshvirohi gatividhiyon kaa plan kiya tha
 After ten days of hide and seek, Omar Khalid made fun of Khalid

 Radhe Maa has lost happiness and peace
 unke mayajaal par kanoonee jaal baari padataa nazar aa rahaa he
 Two new complaints have been filed against him on Tuesday
 bombai hoicourt main vakil phalguni brahmabhatt ne ek yachika daayar kii he
 He has demanded a case to be filed against Radhe Maa alleging vulgarity and cheating
 vahiin, borivali thane main bhi ek duusare vakil ne unke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai he
 With this, Radhe Maa may have to face the trouble of lawsuits from Mumbai to Bhopal
 dahej utpeedan se lekar bhakton kii god main baithna or chote kapade pahanakar dance karne ke maamle main unke khilaaf shikaayatein darj ho rahi hai
 On the other hand, Mumbai Police is waiting when Radhe Maa will finally visit the police station
 'sachai chhip nahin sakati banaavat ke usulon se, khushboo aa nahin sakati kaagaj ke phulon se'
 
 
 Radhe Ma, who is telling this lion in her defense, is referring to the truth, the police is also finding the same truth against him
 un par aarope lag rahe hai
 But she says that she is innocent
 kabhi khud ko begunaah bataati hai, to kabhi apane haathon se chamatkaar ko ishwar kaa vardaan bataati hai
 Statement of six people lodged at the police station, the biggest problem in front of Radhe Ma is the dowry harassment case filed in Kandivali, Mumbai
 is maamle main ab kandiwali police ko radhe maa ke bayaan kaa intazaar he
 The statements of a total of 6 people have been recorded at the police station
 dahej utpeedan kii shikaayat karne vaali mahila ke pati nakul gupta, pita daulat gupta, maa lata, bade bhai sandip gupta or uski patni jyoti gupta ke bhi bayaan liye gaye hai
 The accused told themselves to be innocent, so in their statement all the accused have declared themselves innocent
 dahej utpeedan cese main radhe maa saatven number kii aaropee hai
 He is accused of inciting dowry to harassment
 unako 14 agast tak kandiwali thane main pesh hona he
 Now it is interesting to see when Radhe Maa, who proves her innocence in front of the media, goes to the police station and presents herself
 ashleelata failaane kaa laga aaropabatate chalem ki mumbai ke borivali thane main bhi radhe maa ke khilaaf gambhir aarope lagaate hue shikaayat darj karai gai he

 The speculation about forming a government in Delhi is now entering a serious phase of discussions
 pitrupaksh main sarkaar nahin ban sakati, magar bayaan dene par koi roak nahin he
 Today, Sheila Dixit said that the elected governments are the best in democracy
 yadi is sthiti par pahunch gai he bijepi ki wo sarkaar bana sakati he to acchhee baat he
 Allegations are always used for horse trading
 agar wo bana denge to floor of da house par usko bahumat sabit karnaa padegaa
 So, if you buy anything else, then say the same
 ye or baat he ki unki is raay se congress ne kinaaraa kar liya he
 After resigning from the post of Governor of Kerala, the Congress appointed Sheila Dixit as the chairman of the committee to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru
 sarkaar kaise banegi is par shila dikshit kahati hai ki vidhayak aaenge to kisi duusari party se, lekin jitna abhi tak main jaan pai hum ki jo emele he chaahe wo congress kaa ho, bijopi kaa ho yaa aap kaa ho, koi itani jaldi chunaav nahin chaahate hai
 It is difficult to think whether it is right or not to buy only
 meraa khyaal he, jahaan tak mujhe maaloom he jo log mujhe bataa rahe hai ki sarkaar kaise banegi ab wo chunautiyaan to minority government kii rahengi
 Now they will be able to cross it or not
 udhar, aaj ke iconomik times main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kaa intervyuu chapa he
 It is quite long, but i have chosen only that part here which is related to the formation of government or elections in Delhi
 is silsile main iconomik times kii samvaadadaata rohini singh puuchhati hai ki Question- Does BJP want fresh elections in Delhi or will it try to form government on its own
 amit shah− dilli main koi chunaav nahin chahta
 There have been two results in the last one and a half years
 ye donon hi janadesh bijepi ke paksh main aae hai
 We emerged as the single largest party in the assembly and won all the seven seats in the Lok Sabha
 janata kaa faisla saaf-saaf hamaare paksh main he
 The problem is that of the majority at the state level
 mujhe nahin maaloom kii ki bijepi ko koun samarthan degaa yaa nahin degaa, lekin agar koi bijepi ko samarthan dena chahta he or wo aniatik tarika nahin he to hamen kyon uskaa samarthan lene se inkaar karnaa chahie
 Question- So why is BJP indifferent about elections in Delhi amit shah− yah udaseenta kaa sawaal nahin he
 We believe that there is no need to hold a re-election as the party has got two mandates within a short time
 12 disambar 2013 ko dow harshavardhan ne dilli ke up-rajyapal ko chitthee likhi thi jisamen ek para main yah kehete hai ki vidhaan sabha chunaavon ke baad bhaajapa spasht janadesh praapt karke dilli kii janata ke chehre main muskaan bikherna chaahati thi
 This did not happen as it was reduced to just four seats for majority
 phir iske ek para ke baad likhte hai ki dilli kii budhimaan janata ne hamen shashan karne kaa janadesh diya he, lekin purna bahumat na hone kii dasha main main or meri party rajnatik aadarshon kii ucch parampara kaa nirvaah karte hue naitikta ke aadhaar par vipaksh main baithna pasand karenge
 The ethical and transparent method that was not there last year, has it been arranged now
 kya naitik tareeke kaa yah matlab he ki vidhayak chunaav nahin chaahate kuch istipha de den yaa matdaan ke samay nazala zukaam kaa bahaanaa banaakar gaiyr haazir ho jaaen
 On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party accused the vice-president of the state BJP and the alleged sting of the purchase of his MLA, and many journalists and experts from TV channels to newspapers wrote that the Aam Aadmi Party has pushed the BJP back
 kya amit shah kaa bayaan bijepi ko aage badhane ke liye nahin kah rahaa he ki jo hua behad maamuli ghatana he
 In the context of the sting, Rohini Singh of Economic Times asks the BJP national president that sawaal− aam aadmi party ne jo sting oparation kiya he us par aapaki kya pratikriya he
 Amit Shah- i do not have all the details
 hamaari pradesh ikai isaki jaanch kar rahi he
 But in such a big party, if a lower level worker does something in enthusiasm then it should not be associated with the image of the entire party
 sawaal− lekin wo to aapaki rajya shakha ke upaadhyaksh hai− Amit Shah- Okay
 lekin dilli to ek tarah se karporation jaisi he
 Like a municipality
 chota rajya he, isliye agar koi varkar ati utsaah main kuch kar baithta he to usko party ke saath nahin jodna chahie
 Are you really like Delhi Corporation? kya rajya ke aakaar ke hisaab se kisi kaaryakarta ko chhot he ki wo ati utsaah main aakar kisi vidhayak ke kathith rup se kareed farokht main shaamil ho jaae
 As a prime ministerial candidate, on 29 September 2013 in Rohini, Narendra Modi said that the happiest Chief Minister in the whole of India is the Chief Minister of your state
 sabase sukhi
 In the morning and evening, there is no work except cutting the ribbon
 naa unako agriculture department dekhnaa padataa he
 Neither do they have an animal husbandry department
 naa unako irrigation kii chintaa hoti he
 Neither do they work as fishermen
 or agar dilli main raste main koi gadde hai to sirf ek bayaan dena padataa he ki ye to karporation kii zimmedaari he
 If law and order is a problem, then all that has to be said is that the Delhi Police is with the Central Government
 unka koi daayitv hi nahin he
 For a government like Delhi's corporation and a government whose head does not do anything other than cut lace, the scale of morality should also be small
 par bijepi ko nau maheene kyon lage ki uske paas janadesh he
 Not one or two
 jab itnaa kah diya to saaf-saaf kyon nahin kaha ki ham sarkaar banaayenge
