 -input language bharat or pakistan ke bich cricket itnaa khaas kyon hota he ye asia cap tii20 ke mahamukaable main ek baar phir dekhne ko mila jab donon tiimon ke bich pratidwandvita apane charam par thi
 Whoever saw this match, just kept on holding his breath
 jab team india bowling kar rahi thi, pakistani wicket teji se gir rahe the or 83 par pakistan ko ol out karne ke baad to sabhi bhartiya prashansakon ko yah jarur lagane laga tha ki match ekatarfa hi hoga lekin jis tarahamohammad aamirane pehle hi over kii chaar gendon par rohit or rahane ko chalata karne ke baad agle over main raina ko bhi pavilion kii raah pakadaa di to match pakistan ke palade main jhuk gaya
 But this match will be remembered as the beginning of the kohli-aamir era
 aamir par kohli bariyaha se wo cricket kheli gai jo aane vaale dinon main bharat-pakistan cricket ke ek nae daur ko likhane kii jhalak bhar he
 When the first three wickets fell, it seemed that if it was a match of 50 overs, then Aamir would have eliminated the entire team alone but the way Kohli managed him, only a world class batsman could do it
 pehle teen overs main 8 ran par teen wicket kho chukitim indiyake saamne ek samay 83 ran bhi bahut bada score dikhne laga tha lekin aise main ek ore up captain or na keval team ke balki puri duniya ke sabase behtareen ballebaaj viraat kohli ne bagdor sambhaal rakhi thi to duusari ore team ke purv up captain or bharat ko dobaaraa vanade world cap dilaane main sabase badi bhoomika nibhaane vaale yuvi khadey the
 Both of them played the innings from here, which is less than they are praised
 aaj kii ballebaaji ye bataane ke liye kaaphi he ki kyon kohli baaki ballebaajon se adhik damdaar hai
 He was managing Mohammad Aamir very easily
 wo aamir ko bas rokane kii koshish kar rahe the
 What was going on in his mind during the match, he told during the award of the match
 unhone mushkil wicket par ghaatak aamir ko unki shandaar bowling ke liematch ke dauranhi badhai di
 Understanding the difficult situation and giving respect to the bowler who is bowling brilliantly, that is what makes a cricketer big
 yani team kii bagdor ek aise kushal, yogya, sooyeeboojh or doordarshee dimag ke paas ja rahaa he jo use puri duniya main team kaa jhanda ooncha karne se nahin roak saktaa
 If India plays a bilateral series between Pakistan in the coming days, then the match between these two will definitely remind waqar-jadeja, sachin-akram, kapil-miandad, imran-gavaskar and venkatesh-sohail
 yahaan ye bataanaa jaruri he ki 2013 se pehle jahaan viraat kohli kaa jeet main 53
 The contribution was 3, then it increased to 89
 4 fisadi ho gaya he
 Before the tour of Australia, Kohli was the fourth highest run-scorer of T20 batsmen, while now he is sitting at number one with a big margin
 is formet ke liye wo jis tarah se dhaal chuke hai usase world tii20 toornament main bharat kii daavedaari or bhi majboot hoti dikh rahi he
 Did not see such bowling
 When Dhoni decided to bowl first after winning the toss, it would not be anywhere in his mind that he would stop Pakistan at less than 100
 pehle hi over main nehra ne pehle hi over menmohammad hafijaco chalata kar wicket ke patjhad kii shuruyaat kar di
 It was difficult for Pakistan to score their balls
 nehra lay main the to dhoni ne bhi unase lagaataar teen overs phenkava daale
 a total of 18 runs were made from his 18 balls, including two fours

 Bumrah's first over went to Maiden
 agali over main do chauke lage to ek wicket bhi unhone jhatak liya
 Pakistan had lost three wickets to their six overs and only 32 runs were added to Pakistan's score on the scorecard
 iske baad pandya or yuvaraj ne wicket taash ke pattey kii tarah bikher die
 As soon as Pandya walked, Shishoab Malikko walked and celebrated him in a special way, jumping in the air and hitting the heel of both his feet
 32 se 42 tak pahunchane main pakistan ke teen or wicket nikal gaye
 Jadeja did the right thing
 jadeja sidhi gend phenk rahe the
 Bowling round the wicket, he became a terror for Pakistani cricketers today
 unhone apni bowling or batting ke jariye ye bataa diya ki aap field main na keval bat or ball se balki fielding se bhi team ke liye ahm yogadan de sakate hai
 Cheetah's fluttering on the field was a great performance match in fielding, in which the cricketers were ready to give their all but wanted the decision of this match in their favor and the same was shown in their performance
 sidhe thro par out karnaa ab antarrashtriya cricket main kam dikhataa he lekin kohli or jadeda ne jis tarah se is tii20 match main in donon ne fielding kii uski jitani bhi tarif kii jaae wo kam nahin he
 Jadeja was showcasing the best fielding not only in the out field but also during his bowling
 jonty rods ke samay ye baar baar kaha jaataa tha ki agar aap balle se yogadan nahin de rahe to acchhee fielding se 25-30 ran to bachaa hi sakate hai or is match main kuch aisa hi fielding kaa najaara dekhne ko mila
 How important this match was for both the teams, it shows that both the teams wanted to play safe and not a single six was scored during the match
 yah aisa keval paanchavaa match he jab kisi antarrashtriyati20 machamen koi chakka nahin laga

 Some call him a fool, while some call him a murderer
 usne 1984 main apane paanch rishtedaaron kii sote samay barbar tareeke se hatya kar di thi, lekin is ghatana kaa gavaah koi nahin tha

 iske baad usne shav ko ek bore main chhupaakar rakhaa, use apni cycle par ladaa or ek jhil main phenk aayaa
 This was not Murmu's first crime
 jaanch se pataa chalaa ki iske pehle vah apane bhai kii hi 'bali' chadha chukaa tha
 In 2004, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence, calling it a 'crime against humanity'
 lekin raashtrapati ne 9 farvari, 2012 ko murmu ko kshamaadaan de diya
 The Supreme Court had no choice but to accept it

" yah nivarak ho saktaa he or bhay paidaa kar aisa kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be punitive for which a person is fined

 seetaram yechuri or venkaiya naidu kii mulaakaat shuukravaar ko honi he lekin yechuri ne mulaakaat se pehle guuruuvaar ko yah baat saaf kar di ki aam sahmati bananaa mushkil he or chunaav hokar rahegaa
 Yechury said that the government is only delaying in the name of building consensus so that the opposition parties do not get a chance to discuss the issue among themselves
 unhone kaha ki agar sarkaar sachmuch aam sahmati ke paksh main hoti to abhi tak naam kaa khulaasa kar diya gaya hota taaki vipakshi partiyaan us par aapas main baatcheet kar saken
 Yechury clearly said that the government is talking of building consensus on one side but on the other side it is also saying that the mandate should be respected
 seetaram yechuri kehete hai ki loksabhaa chunaav main sirf 31 fisadi logon ne BJP ko vot diya tha or baaki vot vipakshi partiyon ko mili the
 This means that the mandate rests with the opposition parties
 agar yahi tark seetaram yechuri bhaajapa netaaon ko bhi dete hai to baithak kaa kya nateeja nikalegaa iskaa andaja aasaani se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 According to sources, the left parties want to make Gopal Krishna Gandhi the candidate of Kovipaksha
 jediu kii taraf se vipaksh kii baithak main shaamil sharad yadav khud ko bhi raashtrapati chunaav kii res main maanate hai
 There is a difference of opinion among the opposition parties as to whether the Aam Aadmi Party should be included in the opposition camp or not
 left partiyaan aam aadmi party ko saath rakhane ke paksh main he lekin congress or kuch duusare dal is maamle main aam aadmi party ko dur hi rakhana chaahate hai
 Not only the left parties, Lalu Yadav's Rashtriya Janata Dal is also not in favor of supporting the BJP candidate under any circumstances
 lalu yadav ko lagata he ki bijepi ke saath khadey dikhnaa unke vot bank ke hisaab se thik nahin hoga
 That is why in the meeting of opposition parties on Wednesday, Lalu Yadav stressed that ideology cannot be compromised for the presidential election
 vahiin NCP jaisi partiyaan ishaara kar rahi hai ki agar bijepi kaa ummidavaar man laayak hua to vah vipakshi khemaa chhodkar is maamle main sarkaar ke saath aa sakati hai
 NCP leader Tariq Anwar says that there is no point in holding elections just for the name
 khaastaur par jab hamen yah baat pataa he ki NDA ke paas chunaav jeetne ke number hai
 The term of the current President Pranab Mukherjee ends on July 24 and the new President will be sworn in by July 21
 17 july ko raashtrapati ke chunaav ke liye matdaan hona he or voton kii ginati dilli main 20 july ko hogi
 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the social media king
 vah soshal media par sabase zyada follow kiye jane vaale netaa hai
 Modi's popularity is not only in India but also abroad
 is baat kaa test kiya, ek you-tub channel ne
 In which many things came to light
 kai logon ne kaha ki narendra modi to trump se bhi zyada majboot hai
 An anchor of a youtube channel called Rickshawali, took a stroll on Ibiza Island where he asked many people if he knew Narendra Modi
 to logon ne kaha haa, vah jaanaten hai modi ek taqatvar netaa hai
 Some people said that Modi is the one who started yoga and he sees him doing yoga on 21 June
 to ek shaks ne ye tak kah daalaa ki narendra modi donald trump se bhi zyada taqatvar hai, vah ek panch main trump ko dhul chataa sakate hai
 The video has been going viral on youtube, and millions of people have watched it
 ekanr ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue kuch logon ne har-har modi, ghar-ghar modi ke naare lagaae
 So people have not missed the slogan of Modi government this time
 kuch log modi kii tulana mahatma gandhi se kar rahe the
 US magazine 'foreign Policy' has released the sixth annual list of '100 global thinkers', under which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been topped in the 'decision-makers' category, followed by Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and bjp's national president Amit Shah is number one
 patrika ne 64-varshiya bhartiya pradhanmantri ko 'karishmai or vyapaar anukool' netaa bataaya he
 By the 2014 elections in India, Modi had convinced many that his charismatic, business-friendly record made him the only person to track India's slow growth rate, the magazine said
 Can bring on patrika ke anusaar, unke bhaashanon ko sunne ke liye hajaaron log khinche chale aate the or unhone 3-di holographic projections se lakhon logon tak apni pahunch banaai
 The magazine also mentions the us-imposed visa ban on Modi after the 2002 Gujarat riots, when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 patrika main 50-varshiya amit shah kii bhi prashansa kii gai he or kaha gaya he unhone uttar pradesh main ek 'durjey prachaar abhiyaan sanchalit kiya' or chunaav main bijepi ko vijay dilaa di
 State Bank of India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya has been included in the list to 'tell the bitter truth about India's debt'
 patrika ke 100 vaishvik chintakon kii suchi main sijinette swaara ke sansthaapak shubhranshu choudhary tathaa samachar prastota padmini prakaash kaa bhi naam he
 Other Indians included in the list are Deepak Kapoor, chairman of the India National Polio Plus Committee and Sangeeta Bhatia, an engineer and physicist from Cambridge, atmospheric scientist v Ramanathan and economist p Dasgupta

 In this meeting, BJP leaders can discuss their next strategy
 sarkaar banane ko lekar jari gatirodh ke bich rajyapal bhagat singh koshyari ne bijepi se poocha he ki kya sabase badi party hone ke naate vah sarkaar bananaa chaahati he
 More than two weeks have passed since the election results, but no Maharashtrian party or coalition party has yet been able to stake claim to form the government

 Party leader Chandrakant Patil gave this information
 udhar shivasena ne rajyapal koshyari kii is pahal kaa swaagat kiya he
 Let me tell you, on Saturday midnight, the term of the 13th Assembly of Maharashtra is over, but the stance is not clear yet for the next government
 bijepi ko rajyapal kaa patramaharashtra ke bijepi adhyaksh chandrakant patil ne news agency pitiai se kaha, 'hamen rajyapal kii ore se patr mila he
 Our core committee will meet on Sunday and the next course of action will be discussed
 ' rajyapal ne yah kadam rajyavidhansabhaka kaarykaal aadhi raat ko samaapt hone se mahaj chaar ghanta pehle uthaaya
 The BJP has emerged as the single largest party in the recently concluded assembly elections
 ek aadhikarik bayaan main kaha gaya, 'rajyapal ne sabase badi party bijepi ke nirvaachit sadasyon ke netadevendra fadanvisase yah bataane ko kaha ki kya unki party maharashtra main sarkaar banane kii icchhuk or usamen sakasham he
 "no party could present," said the statement of Davraj Bhavan, "maharashtra assembly elections were held on October 21 and results were declared on November 24
 iske baavjood koi akeli party yaa gathbandhan dal sarkaar banane ke liye abhi tak aage nahin aae hai
 According to the statement, therefore, the Governor has decided to explore the possibility of forming the government
 ise dekhte hue sabase badi party bijepi se sarkaar banane ko lekar rukh spasht karne ko kaha gaya he
 In the bjp-shiv Sena differences, the BJP has won 105 seats, while the 288-seat Maharashtra assembly has a majority figure of 145 seats
 bijepi kii sahyogi partishivsenaane 56 siten jiti hai lekin mukhyamantri pad ko lekar donon partiyon main matbhed gaharaa gaye hai
 Devendra Fadnavis resigned as Chief Minister on Friday but the Governor has asked him to be the acting Chief Minister
 (PTI se input) There may be a major change in the Juvenile Justice Act soon
 mahila or bal kalyaan mantralay ne kanoon ke tahat kishoron kii umr 18 saal se kam karne kaa prastaav diya he
 This proposal states that the age of juvenile offender should also be determined according to the severity of the crime
 yani qatl yaa balaatkaar jaise sangeen maamalon main shaamil kishoron ko kam umr main bhi sazaa ho sakati he
 Apart from this, the age of juvenile offenders will also be determined by the opinion of medical and experts
 isko lekar alag−alag mantralayon main vichaar−vimarsh shuru ho chukaa he
 The discussion also includes whether it is okay to keep juvenile offenders in juvenile or remand homes or some other arrangement should be made for them
 16 disambar ke gangrape ke baad ye bahes shuru ho gai thi ki kya jaghanya aparaadhon main shaamil kishoron ko bhi kam umr kaa laabh diya ja saktaa he, isko lekar mahila or bal kalyaan mantralay ne ek draft bill saarvajanik kiya tha jisko lekar 2200 se zyada suzav aae
 Now the government is preparing to change this law

 🙏😍 @tapmofficiala post shared byanupam Kher (@anupampkher) ondec 26, 2018 at 6:22 pm PST indian premier lig ke tisare charan ke liye hui nilaamee main pakistani cricketron kii andekhi se naaraaz desh ke cricket board ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki vah isisi ke samaksh is par ek adhikarik virodh darj karaayegaa
 After the meeting in Lahore, PCB chairman Ejaz Butt and Sports Minister Ijaz Hussain Jakharani said that they unanimously decided that the issue would be taken up with the ICC
 bat ne kaha, ‘‘ham isisi main ek shikaayat darj karenge or main khud 10 farvari ko hone vaali isisi kaaryakari board kii baithak main yah mudda uthaaunga
 He said that the whole country was shocked and disappointed by this move of IPL as the franchise teams deliberately kept the players away from the auction
 bat ne kaha, ‘‘ipel bhale hi nijee or vyavsaayik toornament ho, lekin yah mudda desh ke gaurav kaa he or ham isisi se is sambandh main baat karenge
 The PCB chairman said that IPL commissioner Lalit Modi and the owners of franchise teams have given many arguments for not choosing Pakistani players, but they have no merit
 aap bataa rahe the ki da great indian laughter chalange main star plus ne aapako modi kii nakal utaarne se manaa kar diya
 Do you think only Modi can call you to cheat? Hopefully Modi will meet me after the victory of Gujarat
 ve sabakaa sammaan karte hai
 Forgive those who copy
 modi samarthakon ke trol se kisi tarah kii pareshaani?meri samaj main nahin aata ki apane ko modi bhakt bataane vaale or galigalouj par utar aane waalon kii yah jamaat kahaan se numaayan hui he? ye log na aresas se hai na bhaajapa se
 Many in these organizations, including Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, say that all of them like my memory
 modi or rahul gandhi main se koun aapako sabase zyada pasand he?ve donon mere santa-banta hai
 Both are incomplete without each other
 lekin rahul to apane aap main hi kamedi hai or modi teji ke saath unki barabari par aa rahe hai
 Is it difficult or scary to imitate a leader? Now who is the next number? It is difficult to copy the leader but now you can not stop it due to the arrival of social media
 yah hamen fatafat bataa detaa he ki jo kaha gaya he vah sahi he yaa galat
 My next target is UP Chief Minister Yogi Aditya Nath
 upi ke noida main ek laapata maasoom kaa shav milane se hadakamp much gaya
 The dead body was found in a drain near the house
 mritak baccha 27 agast se laapata tha
 Police is investigating the matter after registering the case
 ghatana noida ke sector-5 sthit haraula gaanv kii he
 The name of the deceased 8-year-old was Karna
 parijanon ke mutabik, beeti 27 agast ko karn ghar ke baahar se hi gaayab ho gaya tha
 The family tried hard to find Karna but could not find anything
 thak-harkar parijanon ne police ko maasoom kelaapatahone kii soochna di
 After which, once again the reckless face of Noida Police came out
 police ne shikaayat darj karne ke bajaay parijanon ko hi karn ko talash karne kii salaah dekar unhen lautaa diya
 On Monday, Karna's body was found in a flowing drain near the house, causing chaos in his family
 karn ke shav ko ek bore main band kar naale main phenkaa gaya tha
 Karna, the only brother of four sisters, was no longer in this world
 parijanon kii maane to unki kisi ke saath koi dushmani nahin he
 In such a situation, the question arises as to why Karna was kidnapped and brutally murdered
 vahiin parijanon ne police par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki agar police ne vakt rahete maamle ko gambhirtha se liya hota to aaj karn jinda hota
 At present, the police are talking about action after the death of innocent
 umas bhari garmi ke bich 11 june ko jab suraj dhal rahaa tha, bijepi raajnneeti kii dhalaan par pahunche apane pitrupurush laalkrishna adwani ko manaane ke formule ke kareeb pahunch rahi thi
 Just past 6
7 pm at Advani's house, BJP President Rajnath Singh read a written statement, 'this afternoon the Sarsanghchalak of the RSS, Shri Mohan Bhagwat, discussed with Shri Advani and accepted the decision of the Parliamentary Board of the BJP in the national interest
 Urged to continue to guide
 shri adwani ne shri bhagwat kii is salaah ko maanane kaa faisla kiya he
 'it was not just a bhagwat boot to stop the earthquake, but how the Sangh, which advised from behind the scenes, has now taken command of the party from the decision-making to its implementation, it was an open question
 sangh parivaar ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka he jab bijepi main uski dakhlandaji kaagajon par ukeri gai
 Now this is not only a document, but has become an important link between Bhagwat, Advani and the party in every important decision of BJP
 duusari ore, is bhuuchaal ke centre bane sangh ke sah sarkarywah suresh soni kathghare main aa gaye hai
 Hurt by his interference, a senior BJP leader even called Bhagwat and said, "if the decisions are made in this way, you will probably be called the last head of the Sangh, the Sanghchalak
" 'satta ne lagaaya chaskakya rashtravaadi or saanskrithik sanghathan kaa dambh bharne vaala sangh vaaki raajnneeti se dur he yaa ab uskaa puri tarah se raajnneetikaran ho rahaa he? bijepi kaa sangheekaran to ek kathor satya he, vaise ise na kabhi sangh ne kabuula or na bijepi ne
 But the way in which Soni took an active part in internal affairs of BJP in Goa and tried to ignore the senior most leader like Advani, it has lost the credibility of the Sangh
 majabuuran bijepi kii kaman ab sidhe bhagwat ko sanbhaalani padi he
 It is expected that during the meeting of the Sangh's governing board in Amravati in late July, the bjp's work may be snatched away from Soni and given to another co-government minister Gopal Krishna or Dattatreya Hosabale
 bhagwat kaa bijepi ke bare main siddhant he- party main sudhaar se hi sangh kii chhavi judi he
 The Sangh therefore underwent a generational shift to BJP surgery
 adhyaksh pad ke liye nitin gadakari ko aage kiya, lekin bhagwat kii pasand bane gadakari duusare turm ke liye sangh kii hari jhandi ke baavjood bijepi kii khinchataan ke shikaar ho gaye
 The episode created a communication gap between Advani and Bhagwat, but Advani's resignation episode has created a dialogue between the two
 pehali baar aisa hua he ki salaah dene vaale sangh ne bijepi sansadeey board ke faisle ko manwaane ke liye bhi sidhi bhoomika nibhaai he
 Though the Sangh has been indirectly interfering in politics in the past, relations began to emerge openly after the formation of the NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 sangh ke purv sarasanghachaalak rajju bhaiya tak satta kii hode nahin thi, isliye parivaar main kalah kii sthiti baahar nahin ai
 At that time, the Sangh could not be vocal even because of Vajpayee's image and stature
 lekin 10 march, 2000 main hardliner maane jane vaale ke
 s
 sudarshan ke sarasanghachaalak banane ke baad bijepi main sidhaa dakhal shuru ho gaya
 On the Tehelka episode, he directly targeted Vajpayee
 18 march 2001 ko unhone kaha tha, ''pradhanmantri karyaalay main kuch aksham log baithe hai
 If there were capable people, this crisis would not occur
 ” haalanki endie shashan ke dauraan bijepi-sangh main raar nahin thani, par ganth jarur ban gai thi
 Whose blast Sudarshan exploded in an interview on 9 April 2005 advising vajpayee-advani to retire
 jinna ko secular bataane par sangh ne adwani ke khilaaf to morcha hi khol diya
 It forced Advani to declare at the Chennai executive meeting held on 16–18 September 2005 that he would step down as president in December
 tab adwani ne sangh par party ke rosemara ke kaam main dakhal dene kaa aarope bhi lagaaya tha
 But the same association made Advani the PM candidate in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 sangh ke sarkarywah joshi ne india today ke saath saakshaatkaar main mana tha, ''agar ek avasar (jinna prakaran) ko chhod diya jaae to mujhe nahin lagata ki sangh kaa bijepi ke roj ke kaam main dakhal he
 'but it is also a fact that if the Sangh wants to control the BJP, then the BJP also keeps staring at the Sangh on every issue from ideological-policy matters
 isaki vajah sangh kaa vishaal kader he or vah apni isi takat ke jariye bijepi par puraa niyantran rakhata he
 a representative of the Sangh is always in the BJP
 party kaa sanghathan mantri puri tarah se sangh kaa prachaarak hi hota he, jisaki niyukti sangh hi karata he
 At present, there is one Union minister at the central level in the BJP and two co-organization ministers from the Union, the same situation prevails in the states
 ho gai ab maili chadariyasang ne apni soch ko saakaar karne ke liye raajnneeti ko hameshaa upkaran banaaya he
 In post-independence Jana Sangh Pt
 dinadayal upaadhyaay jaise swayamsevakon ko bheja, to 1980 main bijepi kii sthapana ke baad se sangh ne use apana mukhauta bana liya
 But since the formation of the NDA government, the trend of Sangh campaigners also turned towards politics
 sangh main prachaarak ab kam hone lage hai or purnakalik kaam karne vaale ab kuch samay seemaa ke liye hi aana chaahate hai
 At first, people used to leave their jobs to join the promotional system
 khud sarkarywah bhaiyyaji joshi iske udhaaharan hai
 There is no dearth of such people in the current generation of the Sangh
 adwani se pehle uma bharti bhi chitthee likhakar soni kii shikaayat kar chuki hai
 Recently, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan did not allow Prabhat Jha to become the state president again, despite Soni's wish, then Soni also did not allow Shivraj to come to the Parliamentary Board
 khud bhagwat kii ore se di-4 (sushamaa, jetali, venkaiyya naidu, anant kumaar) ke netaaon ko adhyaksh nahin banane dene kaa elaan, raakh se bijepi kii tulana or chemotherapy kii jarurat bataane kii koshish, sangh ne bijepi main sidhaa dakhal diya
 The Sangh used to recommend two-three candidates in the BJP earlier, but did not hesitate
 ab rajya kii chunaav samiti ho yaa centre kii, har seat par sangh ke numaayinde (sanghathan mahaamantri) vito kaa istemaal karne lage hai
 In 1998, Vajpayee sent a list of Rashtrapati Bhavan to make Jaswant Singh a minister, but before the oath the name was dropped under pressure from the Union
 sangh main ab log dhyey, nishtha, shraddha ke saath kam, nijee swaarthon ke chalate zyada jud rahe hai
 Now the BJP leaders have started thinking that if they can become the state president, MP or MLA by winning the position of a leader of the Sangh, then why should they lose their time in the district board
 badlaav kaa dwandv or shakha main kamibhagwat hameshaa kehete rahe hai ki 'bharat ek hindu raashtra he’ ke alaava ve sab kuch badlaav ko taiyaar hai
 But the union's contradiction with modernity is a hindrance to change
 sangh se jude ek varisht netaa bataate hai, ''jab headgavar ne khaaki nikkar ko ganavesh banaaya tha, jo vah us vakt kii aadhunik poshaak thi, jise sirf angrej pahante the
 a large section of the Sangh wants to change it in the modern era, but the old people are sitting on it as a symbol
 ” par sangh ke prachaar pramukh manmohan vaidya kii daleel he, 'sangh hameshaa badalata rahata he, ham puraani chizon ko chhodkar aage badhate hai
 At present, there is no consensus on the change in uniform, but there is no restriction on uniformity to visit the branch
 'yah bhi dukhad satya he ki sangh kii shakhaon main lagaataar giravat darj ho rahi he
 Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi himself confesses, "today the circumstances are different
 jivan style or shiksha paddati main parivartan aayaa he, jiskaa parinaam puure saamaajik jivan par hua he or kuch sangh kii shakha par bhi hua he
 According to an estimate, there are 30,000 regular branches of the association across the country
 is samvaadadaata ne jab purvi dilli kii kuch shakhaon par jaakar jayja liya, to kahin chaar to kahin 10-12 swayamsevak najar aae
 a Sangh leader says, "when i used to go to the shakha as a child volunteer, i used to play a game of security by making mud kashmir
" usee khel main ek baar kandhaa chotil hua, jo aaj tak dard de rahaa he, par josh kam nahin hua

 It was not a joke
 yah jaruri nahin ki agar do log ek hi rang ke honge, to vah ek hi vyakti bhi hon
 It is also the duty of the Indian media to educate those people instead of promoting this and making this news continuously in the media

 The most important question is, why did the government have to file two affidavits in Ishrat case? And on what did the government prepare the second affidavit? is par congress kii safaai alag he or grih mantralay kii raay alag
 Seeing the old files of Ishrat case, it is known that Chidambaram was also familiar with the second affidavit on Ishrat and GK Pillai

 In the second affidavit, Chidambaram denied every report and said there was no evidence
 apane afasaron ko bharose main liye bina purv grih mantri ne puure halafanaame ko badal daalaa
 The comments unhone sab ko clin chit de di or ibi, ro or duusari agenciyon ke input kinare rakh die
 Pillai did not object and the Under Secretary had to sign another affidavit, but former Home Minister Chidambaram believes that he did what was right
 unke saath khadi congress ne halafanama badalane kii baqayada vajah bataai he
 Accordingly, the first affidavit was given on August 6, 2009, until it seemed that Ishrat was a Lashkar terrorist and the encounter with her was genuine
 7 sitambar 2009 ko espi tamang kii metropolitan court ne kaha - muthbhed farzi thi or ishrat ke lashkar aatanki hone kaa saboot nahin he
 In light of this result, the affidavit was changed on 29 September 2009

 According to sources - the first affidavit had inputs from Maharashtra, Gujarat and IB

 The former Home Minister changed the entire affidavit without taking his officers into confidence
 tippaniyan He gave a clean chit to everyone and left the input of IB, RAW and other agencies
 pillai ne koi etraz nahin kiya or avar sachiv ko duusare halafanaame par dastakhat karne pade lekin purv grih mantri chidambaram maanate hai ki unhone jo kiya, wo sahi kiya
 The Congress standing with him has given the reason for changing the affidavit

 Even Valmiki was a Shudra and today he is known as Maharishi

 This Ekadashi is said to have special significance for the atonement of sin

 It is said that if Lord Vishnu is meditated by fasting on this day, then man gets freedom from all his sins

 Method of fasting for Yogini Ekadashi - Take water in the morning and offer water to the Sun God
 - iske baad pile vastra dhaaran karke bhagwaan vishnu kii puja karen
 - Offer them yellow flowers, panchamrit and tulsi dal
 - iske baad shri hari or maa lakshmi ke mantron kaa jaap karen
 - Donate water, food, clothes or shoes to a poor person
 - keval jal or fal grahan karke hi upwas rakhen
 What to do for good health and freedom from mental problems - keep fast on Ekadashi
 - din bhar or raat bhar keval jaleey aahaar grahan karen
 - Worship Shiva as much as possible
 - kam se kam bolen or krodh na karen
 What to do to atone for sin - keep fast on Ekadashi
 - subah-shaam shri hari kii upasna karen
 - It would be best to recite Gajendra Moksha

 BJP has released the third list of candidates
 aaj chauthi list bhi aane kii sambhaavna he
 According to sources, the BJP has decided that leaders above the age of 75 will not be contested

 Sources say that Maneka Gandhi had told the party leadership that she wants to contest from Karnal seat in Haryana instead of Pilibhit
 jabaki unke bete varun gandhi ko pilibhit se tikat diya jaae
 Varun Gandhi is currently an MP from Sultanpur
 lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki bijepi main pichley hafte hi haryana main bijepi main shaamil hue purv saansad arvind sharma ko tikat degi
 Therefore Maneka Gandhi was told that no entry in Karnal
 aise main ab menka gandhi chaahati hai ki unhen sultanpur se or varun gandhi ko pilibhit se tikat diya jaae
 Varun Gandhi won the Lok Sabha elections from Pilibhit in 2009
 party netritv chahta he ki menka gandhi or varun gandhi main se kisi ek ko hi tikat diya jaae
 It remains to be seen what the party decides on the mother-son

 In Karnataka's Chitrakarnataka, BJP has announced the names of candidates for 21 seats out of 28 seats

 Raghavvendra, son of BS Yeddyurappa from Shivamoga, re-joined the BJP after leaving the Congress from Hassan seat, former minister a Manju, quit the Congress and joined BJP MLA Dr Umesh Jadhav against Mallikarjun Kharge from Gulbarga
 iske alaava kendriya mantri sadanand gauda, anant hegade ko party ne phir mauka diya he
 The name of the candidate from Bangalore South seat has not been announced yet

 The way the BJP has announced the names of the candidates in its first list, it seems that the equation created by the party by manipulating it is correct according to the party's strategy

 lo bhai
 In one stroke, Delhi's stain was washed away
 agar daag lagane se kuch acha ho - phir to vakidag achche hai
 Whatever results come in Bihar - it does not matter
 baad main jo bhi ho bhalaa se
 Have to agree
 kuch bhi ho, jab kirapa barasati he to aise hi
 Rajnath ji does not come like 100 million missed calls
 mauka to aapako bhi diya gaya
 what did you do? Just brought BJP to power in the center
 mana ki pehali baar bijepi ko itani siten milin, lekin satta kii raah to upi se hokar jaati he
 Rajnath ji, you are from UP and after coming from Gujarat, Amit Babu got that number of seats
 wo thodi si to isliye chhod di kyonki parivaar kaa maamla tha, varanaa dilli main 'aap' kii baat kabhi nahin hoti
 Now you tell me
 10 karod missd kol ke mukaable 17 karod vot ke kya myne hai
 You must have heard - 'thousands of years, Nargis cries on her disunity, it is very difficult to be born in Chaman'
 amit babu aise hi didavar hai
 He must have had some relationship with Deendayal Upadhyay in his previous life
 yakeen na ho to aap unka sach kaa saamana karaie - pichley janm kii sari baaten maaloom ho jaaengi
 Thank God Modi had to go somewhere
 isliye amit babu kii tulana main sirf gandhi or lohia kaa hi naam le paae
 Yes, did not forget Deendayalji
 agar thodaa vakt or rahata to chamatkarikta ke maamle main amit babu marks, lenin or che gevara ko bhi peeche chhod die rahete
 Every leader walks according to his era
 gandhi or jepi logon ko jail jane ke liye bolte the - or log unki baat par daud padate the
 Now who has the right to do this? zyada din kii baat nahin he
 At the time of the Ramlila movement, Anna's tongue was slightly slurred - and the faces of those who were present nearby were telling their faces
 uske baad anna ne bhi kabhi jail bharne kaa naam nahin liya
 It is very important to keep up with the times
 aap janata se utana hi ummid rakhie jisase kaam aasaani se ho jaae
 When people understand the language of a missed call, then find a way out in it
 subah kii missd kol kaa matlab kuch or hota he, shaam kaa kuch or
 There is a missed call for everything
 har missd kol kaa matlab alag alag he
 It is just a matter of arranging a missed call
 nattejey aapke saamne hai
 However, the reality of this missed call was asked by the teaching staff of a school in Delhi whose salary was withheld
 gunaah sirf itnaa tha ki ve apane chaatro ke maa-baap ko bijepi kaa sadsy banavaane main naakaam rahe the
 The most interesting about the bjp's membership campaign was a newspaper report in which the journalist heard the entire objection
 peshevraana aadat ke chalate jab unhone apane mobile ke ek miss kol par kol back kiya to bijepi kii ore se swaagat kaa massej aa gaya - or massej ke riplai main unhone bheja ki aisi sadsyta main use koi dilchaspee nahin he to uttar mila - bijepi main aapkaa swaagat he, ab aap bas voter idi mail kar den
 This is like the same international calls on which mobile companies warn not to call back, just as banks keep advising them not to share their details with anyone
 agar kisi ne us missd kol par apane preeped mobile se phone kiya to sara balance fouran saaf ho jaataa he
 This means that if you returned the call to a missed call, you were done
 ab jaaie court main daawa kiijie ki aap bijepi ke sadsy nahin hai
 Whatever anyone else says - whenever there will be a missed call in the world - the name of the largest party will be BJP
 vaaki
 When you stay with Naseebwale, 'kirpa' will rain
 modi ji ne thappa jo laga diya he
 The verdict has already been heard, then there is no scope of debate or hearing in the executive
 sahi myne main amit babu ke sam, daam, dand or bhed se bijepi ko jo 'missd kol' kamyaabi mili he wo 'na bhuto, na bhavishyati' he

 Kejriwal has written a written apology to former Punjab minister Bikram Majithia
 kejariwal ne apane maafeename main kaha ki aarope bebuniyaad the mujhe khed hai lekin is maafeename par wo apane hi ghar main ghir gaye
 To win the Punjab Assembly, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal whipped the then Punjab Minister Bikram Singh Majithia by drinking water
 har raily har manch main aarope jade
 Hoop in Chandigarh, Hoop in Jalandhar, Hoop in Amritsar, Hoop in Majitha
 yahaan tak ki punjab main aam aadmi kii sarkaar banane par jail main daalane kii hunkaar bhi bhari thi
 But only after a year Kejriwal was overturned, the defamation case in the court was so heavy that there was an apology
 aisa pehali hua jab kisi mukhyamantri ne likhit maafinama diya ho
 Former Punjab minister Bikram Singh came to the press conference waving Kejriwal's letter in Majithiaguruwar
 or elaan kiya ki un sangeen aarope lagane vaale kejariwal ne maafee maang lee he
 The Akali leader filed a defamation case on the allegations of Kejriwal and AAP leaders
 kejariwal ke saath-saath sanjay singh or ashish khetaan bhi court main ghasita tha
 But he showed great heart on Kejriwal's apology
 
 
 or ek jatke main sabhi ko maaf kar diya
 Majithia was not only a powerful minister in the Akali government
 balki unki badal parivaar se rishtedaari bhi thi, dipti siem rahe
 Sukhbir Singh's wife Harsimrat Kaur is his sister, which is why Kejriwal targeted Majithia in the Punjab elections
 lekin is kadi main wo is kadar dahalij laangh gaye ki maamla court tak pahunch gaya or unhen jhukna padaa or maafee maangani padi
 Majithia forgave the Chief Minister of Delhi in a jiffy, but his own people do not like to apologize by making accusations
 pehle se naaraaz chal rahe kumaar vishwaas ne tikhaa tanj ksaa, to punjab ke vidhayakon ne janata kaa apmaan qaraar diya
 Now on Friday, Bhagwant Mann resigned as Punjab party president and Sanjay Singh also stood against Kejriwal
 majithia ko likhi maafee kii chitthee ko aam aadmi party kii punjab unit bhi pachaa nahin paa rahi he
 Aam Aadmi Party leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira in Punjab Assembly said that Kejriwal did not discuss anything before the apology
 unhone twit kar kaha ki isse janata ke bich galat sandesh jayega
 Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal had also made this charge against Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and he is also circling the court on this charge

 The matter has been going on since 2015, now it is being speculated that Kejriwal can also apologize by writing a letter to Jaitley
 majithia se kejariwal ke maafeename ke baad aap pravaktaa ke bayaan se is kayaas ko or hawa mili
 Kejriwal is now in government, the biggest face of the party
 or ab chunaav kaa mausam aane vaala he salbhar baad 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav bhi he
 In such a situation, neither the party nor Kejriwal want to remain stuck in the court case, circling the court

 But the issue moved towards criticism of Akhilesh over the law and order of the state and Mayawati
 tab mayawati ne akhilesh ko kaha ki pehle apane baap mulaayam singh ko upi chhodkar jane ke liye kaho, tab mujhase kahana ki upi chhod do
 This was Akhilesh's advice to Mayawati: a few days ago the BSP supremo criticized the bad law and order situation of UP
 tab upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne kaha tha ki jinhen upi main dar lag rahaa he, ve suba chhodkar chale jaaen
 On this, Mayawati said that if Akhilesh remembers, then few days ago his father Mr
 Mulayam Singh Yadav had questioned the law and order of UP and had instructed the CM to learn from the Chief Minister of Bihar
 to agar akhilesh ko rajya chhodkar jane ke liye kahana he to pehle mulaayam singh ko kahen
 Faced with the hoarding of UP will not work, welcoming the formation of a new state of Telangana, Mayawati reiterated the bsp's demand to divide UP into four parts
 mayawati ne apane shasankaal ke aakhri maheenon main vidhanmandal main paarit kar upi ke bantwaare kaa prastaav centre sarkaar ko bheja tha
 But the central government has not taken any initiative on this so far
 mayawati sarkaar kaa prastaav tha ki upi ko harith pradesh, avadh pradesh, purvanchal or bundelkhand main baant diya jaae
 Talking on this, Mayawati today said that many opposing parties are running the work just by making statements
 meri unhen salaah he ki hawaii bayaanbaji na karen or centre par dabaav banavaaen
 He also said that UP should not be confused with the status of a big state
 agar suba bant jayega to upi kii janata kaa zyada vikaas hoga
 Not only the public, but also the officer Deremayawati questioned the bad law and order situation of the state and said that earlier people were scared in sp's Gunda Raj, now loyal officers are also scared
 greater noida main khanan mafia par karrwai ke chalate nilambit kii gai iees adhikari durga shakti nagpal kaa zikr karte hue mayawati ne kaha ki durga kaa maamla is baat kaa udhaaharan he ki rajya main gunda raaj he

 There was also no result of PM Modi talking to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandra Babu Naidu adamantly demanding special status
 aaj shaam tidipi ke donon mantriyon ne piem modi se mulaakaat kar istipha de diya
 Earlier, there were speculations that after PM Modi's conversation with Chandrababu Naidu, one can find a middle ground
 haalanki party ne saaf kar diya he ki wo NDA main bani rahegi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday evening after being separated from NDA
 is baatcheet ke baad endie sarkaar main tidipi ke cote se bane donon mantri ashok gajpati raju or vaai es choudri shaam 6 baje pradhanmantri se mulaakaat karne 7 lok kalyaan maarg pahunche the

 At their behest, both of them submitted their resignations to PM Modi
 idhar piem modi se baat ke fouran baadachandrababu naidune ek ucch stareey baithak bulaai he
 It is believed that if there is a split in the NDA just before 2019, then it will not only affect PM Modi's credibility, but it can also be seen in the elections
 isse pehle rajya sarkaar main bijepi ke mantriyon ne istipha de diya he, to vahiin aaj hi centre sarkaar se tidipi cote ke mantri istipha denge
 a different point of view was also seen in the growing political rivalry between the two parties
 jis dauraan bijepi cote ke mantri andhra pradesh sarkaar se istipha dene pahunche to vahaan maujuud tidipi mantriyon se gale mili or uske baad apana istipha saunpa
 These two ministers of BJP quota are Kamineni Srinivas, Manikyala Rao

 He said that the ministers of BJP quota have resigned from the state government
 in donon mantriyon ne apane vibhaag main kaaphi acha kaam kiya tha
 i thank them naidu ne ye bhi bataaya ki centre sarkaar se unke cote ke mantri bhi aaj istipha denge
 The Center did not keep the promise from Andhra, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP top leader Chandrababu Naidu held a press conference late on Wednesday, saying that injustice had been done to his state
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ne andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kaa vaada nahin nibhaayaa he
 Due to which we have decided to separate from the central government
 naidu ne ye bhi kaha ki wo satta ke bhukhe nahin hai
 Elections in Andhra are next year, hence aggressive
 TDP is very aggressive about the long pending demands in view of simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly next year
 tidipi or bijepi ke bich chal rahi adaavat ke bich naidu or modi kii meeting kaaphi ahm thi
 In this meeting, Naidu handed over a 17-page document to the PM
 donon netaaon ke bich dedh saal baad mulaakaat hui thi
 Know what is the demand for TDP- Chandrababu Naidu demands that the Center immediately approve Rs 58,000 crore for the Polavaram project
 - unhone modi se nae rajya kii rajdhani amravati ke vikaas ke liye kendriya bajet main paryaapt raashi sunishchit karne kaa aagrah kiya
 - He also wants Modi to take immediate steps to increase the state assembly seats from 175 to 225, which has been committed in the Reorganization Act
 - naidu kaa kahana he ki rajya ke vibhaajan ke kaaran andhra pradesh vittiya samasyaon kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 He said that the delay in implementing the commitments made under the Act would add to the problems
 kya he andhra pradesh vidhansabha kaa samikaransaal 2014 main hue andhra pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main bijepi or tidipi ne shandaar pradarshan kiya tha

 The GST bill will be introduced in the Rajya Sabha today
 rajyasabha main jiesti bill paas hote hi desh main ek tex niyam lagu ho jayega
 That is, whatever was being collected now, or the states used to impose tax VAT in their own way, it will all be over
 30 se 35 fisadi tak diya ja rahaa tex ghatakar 17 se 18 fisadi par aa jayega, kyonki exise tex, sarvice tex, waite, cells tex, atortanment tex or lakjri tex khatm ho jayega
 On Tuesday, Congress MP Abhishek Manu Sighvi said, "if there are no obstructions, the GST Bill will be approved on Wednesday"
 sarkaar ne mangalvaar ko hi sadan ke sadasyon ke bich masauda vidheyak kii sanshodhan kapiyaan vitarit kar di thi
 At the same time, BJP and Congress have already instructed their members to be present in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, where the GST Bill is expected to be debated and voted
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ne rakhi thi jiesti kii neenvgauratlab he ki jiesti kii neenv 16 baras pehlevajpeyi sarkaarne daali thi
 The 360 degree rotation is expected to pass in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, because 16 years ago the Vajpayee government could not submit if it was in a minority and in 2009, the Manmohan government tried, then the non-congress ruled states protested
 ab centre or zyaadaatar rajyon main bijepi kii bahumat vaali sarkarein hai, to rajyasabha main congress ko saath lene ke liye modi sarkaar apane rukh thode naram kiye
 After which agreement was reached with Congress
 aam aadmi ko jiesti se phaayde kii ummidek desh ek tex kii soch desh main lagu hote hi iskaa phayda har vyakti ko milegaa
 With this, more than 20 indirect taxes will be eliminated and only three types (central, State and Integrated GST) will be taxed
 central jiesti tex centre sarkaar vasuulegi
 The State GST tax will be levied by the State Government, and the Integrated GST will be levied by the Central Government, as it will be levied on the trade between the two states
 kuch chijen sasti hongi to kuch mahangi bhijaahir he ye sawaal har jahan main hoga ki jiesti lagu hone se kya sasta or kya mahangaa hoga? restaraan main khaanaa khaanaa, kazumar durables masalan air condishan, microwave, mashinari saamaan or maal dhulaai sasti hogi to jabaki dibba band food products, chaay, coffee, mobile bill, cradid card kaa bill, jewelri or kapadaa mahangaa ho jayega
 It is possible to increase the growth rate due to the implementation of GST, inflation may also increase by two to three years after the implementation of GST
 vaise sarkaar kaa daawa he ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad growth rate main 2% kaa ijapha hoga
 However, the truth is that no government has been reelected in the elections held after the implementation of GST all over the world, because some things become expensive in the initial years, the government has to suffer
 janata dal you ke jokihat ke vidhayak sarfaraj alaam ne party se or vidhansabha kii sadsyta se istipha de diya he
 Since he left the party, it is believed that he will be the RJD candidate in the by-election from Araria parliamentary constituency

 pita ke argedy main hone ke baavjood pichley do turm se sarfaraj alam janata dal you ke vidhayak hai
 RJD leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav is calling it a setback to the Janata dal-u
 unhone kaha ki abhi or vidhayak tootenge
 Along with Nitish Kumar, i also like that i am still a child
 halaki, taslimuddin ke nidhan ke baad yah sabko pataa tha ki argedy unke bete sarfaraj ko hi tikat dene vaali he
 Because Taslimuddin was a very popular leader in that area, and giving ticket to his son will also give Sahanubhuti
 pichley loksabhaa ke chunaav main argedy ke ummidavaar taslimuddin ne bijepi ko kareeb ek lakh 48 hajaar vot se haraaya tha tab janata dal you bhi alag se chunaav ladi thi
 This time in Bihar, one parliamentary and two assembly by-elections are to be held on 11 March

 He said that we are not a big leader, Taslimuddin Saheb had not fought like this, we have no suffocation anywhere
 lekin janata jo chaahati he or janata kaa pressure tha or maine istipha diya
 If people ask Araria ahead, they will contest elections, i will not comment on JDU, it will tell the time and situation
 sarfaraj alam ke istife ke baad jadyu ne kaha he ki jadyu ko isse koi fark nahin padataa he
 Spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said that such resignations keep happening during the elections, but the Rashtriya Janata Dal has lost its base
 nitish kumaar ke netritv main sarkaar kaam kar rahi he or narendra modi kii jo lokapriyata he usase aagaamee up chunaav ham arriya se jeetenge
 The RJD is under the misconception that Sarfaraz will be able to achieve a lot with his departure, what kind of manipulation is it that you broke a party MLA by giving him the ticket of Parliament
 isse chunaav main koi fark nahin padegaa

 Under this campaign, the Chief Minister himself along with his ministers and government officials will work to prevent mosquitoes from growing
 mukhyamantri kejariwal ne bataaya ki yah campan aagaamee 1 sitambar se shuru ho jayega, jisamen log jaanch karenge ki unke ghar ke aasapaas kahin dengue kaa machhar to nahin punap rahaa he
 Along with the announcement of the awareness campaign, the Chief Minister also presented figures of Dengue and Chikungunya from 2015 to 2019
 unhone daawa kiya ki maatr chaar saal main dilli main dengue or chikangunia kaa prakope 80 fisadi tak kam hua
 According to the data, in 2015, 15,867 cases, 60 deaths occurred while in 2018 2,798 cases were reported, while 4 people died
 dilli sachivalay main press conference ke dauraan kejariwal ne kaha, 'dengue or chikangunia se nijaat paane ke liye 1 sitambar se ek vyapak abhiyaan shuru kiya jayega
 The campaign will be named Ten Weeks, Ten o'clock, Ten Minutes

 2014 main modi lahar ke vaqt chunaav se thik pehle kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki rahul gandhi apni puraani amethi seat kii bajaay raibareli se chunaav lard sakate hai
 In such a situation, Sonia Gandhi herself can be shifted to Amethi
 sutron ke mutabik rahul ko party ke bheetar aisa prastaav bhi diya gaya
 It was argued that it would be easier for Rahul to win from Rae Bareli instead of Amethi in the atmosphere against Kumar Vishwas, Modi wave, Smriti Irani's claim and Congress
 magar congress adhyaksh rahul ne do took ye kahkar inkaar kar diya ki vah haare yaa jite, lekin seat nahin badalenge
 Later, in a tough contest, Rahul won by nearly one lakh votes
 rahulki jeet ke antar main khaasi kami aa gai thi
 Also, despite the defeat, Union Minister Smriti Irani is continuously interfering in Amethi
 vahiin sonia congress kii kaman rahul ko saunp chuki hai
 In such a situation, speculation has intensified once again that Rahul can turn to Rae Bareli in 2019 instead of Amethi
 congress adhyaksh kii ranneetiwahin rahul ko ye baat katai raas nahin aa rahi
 He has made it clear that he is not going to leave Amethi, but on April 18, 2018, when Rahul was scheduled to accompany Rahul along with Sonia in a review meeting of Rae Bareli District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee
 donon ko raibareli ke bhuemau guest house main hi ruknaa tha, vahiin janata darbar kaa hi kaarykram bana tha
 In such a situation, the speculations again caught the emphasis that Sonia is now going to hand over the reins of Rae Bareli to Rahul
 darasal, rahul kahmethi sansadeey kshetraki ek vidhansabha salon raibareli zile main aati he
 Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, Rahul was scheduled to participate in this meeting with Sonia
 isse pehle bhi andarkhaane aise kaarykram bane, lekin isi dar se rahul khud sonia ke saath jane se bachate rahe
 Eventually this time the program was officially made, the media was told
 isi bich ilaake main afvaahon ke bazaar main ek baar vahi charchaa tej ho gai
 Amethi According to the first choice sources, when Rahul reached this point, Rahul himself made it clear to the local leaders that he had to fight his next election from Amethi
 amethi unki pehali pasand he
 In such a situation, if i go to the meeting, the same message will go to the media and the public that i will contest the next election from Rae Bareli
 media main aksar aisi khabaren aati bhi hai
 In such a situation, the media will also do the same thing
 phir kya tha? rahul baithak main nahin gaye or sonia ne akele hi hissaa liya
 Yes, Rahul took great care that he should not be accused of not going to the review meeting of the development of the area
 isliye sonia gandhi baithak main hissaa leti raheen or idhar rahul puure vaqt salon kaa daura karte rahe
 After that, rahul-sonia finally reached Phursatganj Airport in Amethi separately and left for Delhi
 modi sarkaar par nishanajane se thik pehle bataur congress adhyaksh rahul media se mukhaatib hue or pehle cash crunch ke liye modi par hamalaa bolaa
 Rahul said - it is all connected, take out people's money from pocket and give it to Nirav Modi, there is financial crisis everywhere, people are not getting money, people are just in line, everyone is upset again While Modi is silent
 iske baad rahul ne amit shah ke raibareli daure kii khabaron par bhi chutki lee
 The question was that Amit Shah is coming to Rae Bareli to find his party's land? On hearing the question, Rahul first smiled in a sarcastic tone
 phir bole- sawaal ye he ki neerav modi, rafel ghotaalaa, gujarat main petroleum ghotaalaa or amit shah ke bete 50 hazaar ko 80 karod main badal dete hai, aae din bhrashtachar ke maamle saamne hai
 But PM does not say anything to anyone, if i get 15 minutes in Parliament, then i will not be able to stand in Parliament, corruption is spread everywhere

 idi kii ore se is baat kii jaanch kii ja rahi he ki kahin isamen videshi vinimay se jude niyamon kaa ulanghan to nahin hua he
 The report quoted the ED official as saying that the investment was brought without the approval of the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
 yah niyamon ke khilaaf he
 This is the reason why many senior officials including the Chief Financial Officer of Jet Airways have been questioned
 vahiin aitihaad airways ke pravaktaa ne pallaa jhaadte hue kaha he ki hamane sabhi niamkeey jaruraton kaa paalan kiya he
 We acquired our stake in Jet Privilege Private Limited (JPPL) about 6 years ago
 isliye jepipiel se sambandhit koi bhi sawaal jet se hi puche jane chahie
 'let us know that the airline Jet Airways, which is in debt of more than 8 thousand crores, has stopped its airlines temporarily

 sarkaar kii no ditension policy par shiksha par sabase badi salaahkaar samiti keb (central adwiseri board of ajukeshan) ne sarkaar se sifarish kii he ki faisla rajya sarkaron par chhod diya jaae ki paanchavin kaksha se vah is niti kaa paalan karnaa chaahate hai yaa nahin
 However, this policy will remain mandatory till the fourth grade
 no ditension policy ke tahat rajya 8veen kaksha tak kisi chaatr kii pariksha nahin le sakate
 This has led to resentment in many states, as they feel that students do not study
 lihaaja, 9veen kaksha se unhen pariksha main paas hona mushkil hota he
 The No Detention Policy is a part of the Right to Education Act and changes have to be made in the law
 sambhaavna he ki sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main hi sarkaar yah sanshodhan lekar aegi
 The comments keb ne sarkaar se sifarish kii he ki artii act main badlaav kar ye rajyon par chhod diya jaae ki vah is niti ko lagu rakhen yaa hataaen, lekin chauthi tak koi rajya bacchon kii pariksha nahin le paaegaa, yani no ditension par paanchavin ke baad hi rajya koi faisla kar sakate hai
 In the meeting of Keb, states also said that due to any policy, it is not possible to know what the students are learning
 ab kanoon main larning outkam ke naam par ye bhi vyakhya kii jaaegi ki kis kaksha ke bachche ko kam se kam kitni jaankaree honi chahie
 Under the No Detention Policy, states cannot take any student's examination till 8th grade
 isse kai rajyon main naaraazgi he, kyonki unhen lag rahaa he ki chaatr padhai nahin karte
 Therefore, from 9th grade they find it difficult to pass the exam
 no ditension policy shiksha ke adhikaar kanoon kaa hissaa he or ise badalane ke liye kanoon main parivartan karnaa hoga
 It is likely that the government will bring this amendment only in the winter session of Parliament
 tippaniyan Keb has recommended to the government that the RTE Act be changed and left to the states to keep this policy in force or remove it, but no state will be able to take the children's examination till the fourth, i
e
 the state only after the fifth on No Detention Anyone can decide
 keb kii baithak main rajyon ne ye bhi kaha ki koi niti hone kii vajah se ye pataa nahin chal paa rahaa he ki chaatr kya sikh paa rahe hai
 Now in the name of learning income in the law, it will also be interpreted that the children of which class should have at least how much information
 keb ne sarkaar se sifarish kii he ki artii act main badlaav kar ye rajyon par chhod diya jaae ki vah is niti ko lagu rakhen yaa hataaen, lekin chauthi tak koi rajya bacchon kii pariksha nahin le paaegaa, yani no ditension par paanchavin ke baad hi rajya koi faisla kar sakate hai

 30 assembly seats in Jatland, Haryana: In Jatland, about 30 per cent Jat community in the politics of BJP candidate Chakravyuh Mehriana has the power to win elections and topple any government
 yahi vajah he ki haryana kii raajnneetik dhuree lambey samay tak jat samudaay ke ird-gird hi gumti rahi he
 There are only a few days left for the assembly elections and it is a big challenge for the BJP to penetrate the opposition Chakravyuh on the seats coming in the Jatland area of haryana
 jatland vaali sitenharyana main rohtak, sonipat, panipat, jind, kaithal, sirsa, jhajjar, fatehabad, hisar or bhivani jile kii kareeb 30 vidhansabha siton par jaaton kaa acha prabhaav he
 Due to this, this area is called Jatland
 yahaan kii siton par jat samudaay haar-jeet kaa faisla karte hai
 In these 30 seats of Jatland, big BJP veterans are also facing a tough challenge, due to which the Jat leaders of the party are not able to get out of their area

 Apart from this, in many assembly seats like Garhi Sampla, Kiloi, Beri, Maham, Kaithal, Ellenabad, the BJP candidate is facing a tough challenge from the opposition candidates
 bijepi ko kisi seat par jejepi se to kisi par congress ke saath sidhaa muqabla he
 Whose bet on the Jat community? In Jatland, Haryana, BJP has fielded just 20 Jat candidates
 duusari taraf congress ne haryana kii satta main vaapasi ke liye jaaton par bharosa jataayaa he or purvamukhyamantri bhupendra singh hooda ko haryanachunaav kii kaman saunpi he
 While Congress has fielded 27 Jat candidates, Dushyant Chautala's party JJP has bet on 34 Jat candidates
 iske alaava inelo se kareeb 30 jat pratyaashee taal thok rahe hai
 The BJP won 10 seats in Jatland, saying that even in the last assembly and recent Lok Sabha elections, the political politics of the opposition was not broken on the seats related to Jatland
 pichley chunaav main jatland kii 30 main se bijepi mahaj 10 site hi jeet saki thi
 The Jat voters may not have openly supported the BJP in the last election but the Jat voters in Haryana are not possible to ignore, which is why the party made Subhash Barala the state president and the powerful Jat leaders like OP Dhankhar and Captain Abhimanyu were in the cabinet
 Gave place in baavjood iske isi saal hue loksabhaa chunaav main jat bahulya vidhansabha siton par bijepi badhat nahin bana pai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP lost the Jat dominated assembly seats despite clearing the opposition

 Whereas the seat of second Jat leader and cabinet minister Om Prakash Dhankad was the same in Badli
