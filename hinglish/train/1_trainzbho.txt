 In Madhya Pradesh, the opposition Congress has termed the state government's decision to distribute puffed rice as an argument to prevent malnutrition among Anganwadi children
 saath hi ise sarvocch nyaayalay ke nirdeshon ke khilaaf bataaya
 Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Ajay Singh said, 'the power of thinking and thinking of the government has been exhausted, so it has come down to experiment with malnourished children
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne varsh 2004 main spasht aadesh diya tha ki kuposhit bacchon ko pakaa hua bhojan hi diya jaae or bhojan banane va vitaran kaa kaam sthaneey swayan sahaayta samoohon ko diya jaae, lekin rajya sarkaar ne sarvocch nyaayalay ke adeshon ko darkinar karte hue bacchon ko murmura baantne kaa nirnay liya he
 Expressing regret over the state government's decision to declare Murmure as nutritious in place of porridge, khichdi and lapsi, Ajay said, "in the state where 52 percent of the children are malnourished, the decision of the state cabinet to remove their malnutrition from Murmure is certain Generally, it questions both the intention and policy of the government
 ’unhone kaha ki kuposhan samaapt karne kii sarkaar kii niti shuru se hi sawaalon ke ghere main rahi he
 In this policy, instead of protecting nutrition for malnourished children, more attention has been taken in the interests of the contractors who are involved in its supply

 There are few signs of reconciliation between the ruckus in Bihar in the Grand Alliance
 sutron ke mutabik, argedy pramukh lalu yadav ne pichhali raat mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko gathbandhan main jari bayaanbaji par viraam lagane ke silsile main phone kiya tha
 Not only this, Lalu also informed one of his party spokespersons Ashok Sinha to be removed from the post
 saath hi unhone pichley ek saptaah se chal rahe vakyuddh ko samaapt karne kii guzarish bhi kii
 However, a fresh statement by a JDU spokesperson has raised the rage again in the Grand Alliance
 jediu netaa or rajyasabha saansad kasee tyaagi ne argedy ke saath gathbandhan todane kaa ishaara kiya he
 He said that when there was an alliance with the BJP, his party was quite comfortable
 mangalvaar subah mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke naashte ke aamantran ke dauraan najaara kuch badla sa laga
 However, the party Congress, which is part of the Grand Alliance, is still taking an aggressive stance

 He said that people who believe in one principle take a decision and those who believe in many principles take different decisions
 haalanki aaazaad ke bayaan par jediu pravaktaa ne kaha tha ki ham upie kaa hissaa nahin hai
 He also reminded that before the elections in Bihar, it was decided at the time of alliance that this notion would not be accepted in national politics

 However, after this, the RJD president tried his best to change Nitish's decision

 During the Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's breakfast invitation on Tuesday morning, the view changed a bit
 haalanki mahagathbandhan main shaamil party congress abhi bhi hamalavar rukh apanaae hue he
 In fact, on Monday, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad retaliated against Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who was supporting NDA candidate Ramnath Kovind, and said that the first decision was taken by Nitish Kumar on the defeat of 'bihar's daughter'
 unhone kaha tha ki jo log ek siddhant main yakeen karte hai wo ek faisla lete hai or jo log kai siddhanton main bharosa rakhet hai wo alag-alag faisle lete hai
 However, on Azad's statement, the JDU spokesperson said that we are not part of the UPA
 unhone yah bhi yaad dilaayaa ki bihar main chunaav se pehle gathbandhan karte samay hi tay ho gaya tha ki rashtriya raajnneeti main yah dharna sweekaar nahin hogi
 Actually, the whole controversy started after the announcement of the name of the presidential candidate Meira Kumar for the post of President, when Nitish Kumar refused to change his decision and raised questions on this selection itself saying that 'bihar Why was the daughter of 'chosen' to lose
 haalanki iske baad argedy adhyaksh ne apni ore se nitish kaa faisla badalane kii bharpoor koshish kii
 During the Iftar party, the two leaders also held talks, but Nitish kept saying that if this is a historical mistake, then let it be done
 tippaniyan The matter did not stop here, on the lines of PM Modi's radio program 'mann Ki Baat', Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav has started 'dil Ki Baat' and on Sunday, Tejashwi took the name of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar without any name
 He called him autistic and opportunistic
 tejasvi ne kaha, 'aatmakendrit vyavhaar kii vajah se vipaksh bhramit or thodaa bikharaa hua dikh rahaa he
 Opportunistic behavior and political manipulation may lead to immediate benefits or a government collapse, but unlike television anchors, history will testify that when progressive politics needed to be strengthened, we chose another route
 ' Tejashwi's hidden attack on the CM of the state went through the JDU and after this, Bihar unit president Vashistha Narayan Singh questioned the future of the grand alliance
 unhone kaha ki ab sarkaar main shaamil log aise bayaan jari kar rahe hai to ye khatre kii ghanti bajane jaisaa he
 He did not expect such a statement from the deputy CM

 punjab state aids control socity (PSACS) ke aids ke prati jaagarukta ko lekar chhapavaaye gaye pamplate ko lekar vivaad paidaa ho gaya he
 Actually the AIDS Control Society has written some points in its pamphlet to create awareness about AIDS
 inamen aam logon ko aids ke rogiyon ke sankraman se bachane ke upaay bataate hue puraani dakiyanoosee baton kaa ullekh kar diya gaya he
 There are points on page number 4 of Pamphlet, which refer to stereotypical things, not medical, about Aides
 padhie pamplate main aids kii jaagarukta ko lekar kya chapa he
 
 
 1-shaking hands with an AIDS patient can cause AIDS
 2-aids ke rogi ke dwaara istemaal kiye gaye bartanon kaa istemaal karne se bhi aids ho saktaa he
 3-AIDS patients using electronic devices such as mobiles, computers, etc
 can also cause AIDS
 4-wo bathrum jo aids kaa rogi istemaal karata he us bathroom kaa istemaal karne se bhi aids fail saktaa he
 Let me tell you that these are old-fashioned things, which have been declared medical wrong many times and it has been said that they do not spread AIDS
 lekin iske baavjood punjab stateeds controlsocity ne in puraani dakiyanoosee baton ko apane pamplate main chhapava diya he
 Because of which people's attitude towards AIDS patients is becoming quite misleading

 There has been a ruckus in the political politics of Madhya Pradesh after a statement on the debt waiver of Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 darasal, buudhvaar ko gwalior main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh kehete hai ki madhya pradesh ke kisaanon kaa karjamaf nahin hua, lekin sach to yah he ki congress sarkaar ne shivaraj singh chouhan ke bhai or chachaa tak kaa karja bhi maaf kiya
 After Rahul's statement, Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Minister Sachin Yadav tweeted that he provided proof that Rohit Singh Chauhan, brother of former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Niranjan Singh, son of uncle, were also under loan under "jai Kisan loan waiver scheme" The Government of Madhya Pradesh has pardoned

 com / 9i5gv2wod3 — Sachin Yadav (@syadavmla) May 8, 2019 Sachin Yadav alleged that when Shivraj ji is not aware of his family's debt waiver and is talking about the farmers of the state, Shivraj ji now stop spreading lies
 Please do
 vahiin, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke daawey ko purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ne khaarij kiya
 Shivraj said that the National President of Kikangres, Rahul Gandhi and the Chief Minister are misleading the people about the farmers debt waiver
 unhone mere rishtedaaron kaa karjamaafee karne kii jo baat kahi he vah puri tarah galat he
 Shivraj Singh said that in the list of loan waivers farmers had shown in Rahul Gandhi in Gwalior, my brother Rohit Chauhan's debt was forgiven, but the reality is different
 mere bhai ne to karjamaafee ke liye aavedan tak nahin bharaa tha
 Then why did Kamal Nath be so kind
 shivaraj ke kya di safai

 Former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan held a press conference following allegations of Congress President Rahul Gandhi

 isliye maine chyavanprash lautaa diya he or kaaryakartaaon se kaha he ki wo ise congress ke logon ko dekar aae taaki wo kamalnath or rahul gandhi tak pahunch sake

 desh main gathbandhan kii raajnneeti or bihar ke raajnneetik ghatnakram main yah is varsh kii sabase badi ghoshnaa he
 However, one of the reasons behind this announcement is that the top leadership of the BJP is also feeling that the 'modi wave' is weak
 nishchit rup is ghoshnaa se nitish kumaar ko ek nai raajnneetik sanjivani mili he
 There are two aspects to this announcement
 ek, bhaajapa nitish kumaar kaa mahatv samajhati he or loksabhaa chunaav main unke bina jane kaa koi jua nahin khelnaa chaahati
 At the same time, in Bihar politics, Nitish Kumar is not only the elected leader of the NDA mlas but the top leadership of the BJP has also now accepted that the NDA will demand votes in Bihar only on his face and work and if you like it or not
 lekin sab ye jaananaa chaahate hai ki ye barabari-barabari ke samjhauta kaa kya arth he, ye kaise hua or kab hua
 This declaration has the same meaning that currently Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President Amit Shah and Bihar BJP leaders see no alternative to Nitish Kumar
 unhen lagata he ki nitish kumaar ko saath rakhkar agar loksabhaa chunaav main jaaenge to pichley loksabhaa chunaav main jiti siton kii sankhya ko ek baar phir duharaaya ja saktaa he
 Amit Shah and Narendra Modi have once again shown that they also know how to give importance to allies and like Shah took the burden of normalizing the relationship with Shiv Sena on his shoulder a few months back, Nitish too is a part of Bihar's alliance
 He maintained the coalition religion by giving him the arbitrary seats of Kumar
 duusari ore nitish kumaar ko bhi bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke baad pehali baar laga he ki unke sammaan main koi kasar nahin rakhi ja rahi
 Nitish is happy that as he was being criticized politically, after this seat-sharing, he has now turned out to be baseless and some people have a blank imagination
 nitish is prakaran se ek baar phir majboot netaa sabit hue jo abhi bhi apni baat manwaane kii shakti rakhata he
 Will there be a real political riot now? 50-50 formula in BJP-JDU, Bihar may create 'arrogance' in NDA to akhir ye samjhauta hua kaise? iske peeche kai kaaran hai
 The first reason is that the BJP came to the conclusion that it cannot contest elections by shoring up Nitish
 isamen bihar bhaajapa ke netaaon khaaskar susheel modi, nand kishor yadav or prem kumaar jaise mantri bane baithe netaaon kii bhoomika ahm rahi jo is baat par qaayam rahe ki keval paswan or kushvaha ke sahare chunaav main janaa aatmghaatee sabit ho saktaa he
 Secondly, the BJP conducted more than one survey in which the results were coming to his liking when he went with Nitish, while the results without Nitish were not very favorable
 aakhir kis paale main jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai upendra kushvaha, somvaar ko amit shah se karenge 'siton kii saudebaaji' First of all, Nitish Kumar met Amit Shah in Patna in the month of July, then he promised to fulfill the seat allocation in one month
 lekin asal baatcheet agast maheene main bhaajapa ke netaa bhoopendra yadav, janata dal united ke saansad or nitish ke qareebi aaaraseepi singh or mantri lalan singh ke saath shuru hui jahaan media report ke vipareet bhaajapa 15 siten dene ke liye taiyaar dikhi
 Earlier there was a news from the BJP to give only 12 seats, which was immediately rejected by the Janata Dal
 lekin asal baraabar-baraabar kaa formula khud nitish ne pradhanmantri narendra modi se baatcheet kar prastaav diya jo modi-shah ne 16 sitambar ke pehle maan bhi liya
 Therefore, on September 16, for the first time in front of his party's state executive, Nitish said that the seat agreement has been done in a respectful and in the interest of the party but it will be announced by BJP leaders at an appropriate time
 nitish aashwast the ki siton ke samjhaute kii ghoshnaa jab bhi hogi baraabar-baraabar ke formule par hi aadhaarit hogi
 But in the meantime, Bhupendra Yadav, who was responsible for talking to Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan and rlsp's Upendra Kushwaha, got busy with some other work of the party
 lekin nitish or bihar BJP ke netaa is baat par ekamat the ki agar upendra kushvaha janaa chahen to unke maan manouvval main samay kii barabaadi nahin kii jaae kyonki jis gathbandhan main pradhanmantri narendra modi or nitish kumaar honge use gair yadav voter khaaskar kushvaha voter kabhi duusari ore jaaenge
 Especially towards the grand alliance, which will be headed by Tejashwi Yadav, will not go at all
 lekin paswan ke prati sabhi log ek mat the ki abhi bhi unke paas paswan votaron ko transfar karaane kii kshamta qaayam he isliye agar loksabhaa main unki siten kam ho rahi hon to unhen rajyasabha kisi bhi rajya se bhej kar uski bharpai turant kii jaae
 But the BJP bowed in front of Nitish, and there was a factor behind it that while there was growing anger among Dalits and upper castes about the Dalit Act, Nitish at least gave up most of his demands to please the Dalits and his anger Tried to cool down
 uske baad BJP ko laga ki ab bhi agar nitish ko choda jaae to dalit voton se unhen haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar was angry after forming the government with BJP and he also showed it on many occasions
 phir chaahe pradhanmantri modi ke saamne saarvajanik rup se unki patna vishwa vidhyalay ko kendriya vishwa vidhyalay ghoshit karne kii maang ho yaa pichley saal baadh raahat ke liye maangi gayi raashi kaa pandrah pratishat milane ke baad kii naaraazgi
 He was also disappointed with the NDA not being given any preference
 unako baraabar-baraabar seat dekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley saal july main sarkaar banane ke purv apane ek vaade ko puraa kiya ki raajnneetik hissedari main bhaajapa unka maan sammaan rakhegi
 The comments VIDEO: bihar NDA main siton ko lekar samjhauta Nitish also assured him that he would get more than 31 seats from Bihar in the last election
 aane vaale kuch maheenon main nitish ko, jinke apane survey main tejasvi yadav ke muqaabale lokapriyata 50 pratishat se adhik he, use voton main tabdeel karke dikhaanaa hoga
 Because two strong pillars of the nda's Aadhar vote in Bihar are angry and disappointed with the forward castes BJP and Nitish and the Dalit BJP
 ye sach nitish jitna jaanate hai utana susheel modi bhi
 That is why the NDA is facing a greater challenge than the grand alliance of old voters in Bihar today
 filhal siton ke baraabar-baraabar samjhaute se ek baar phir is baat par muhar lagi he ki bihar main nitish kumaar duulhaa kii bhoomika main hi rahenge, bhale baraat main koi dal peeche khadaa ho

 Will there be a real political riot now? 50-50 formula in BJP-JDU, Bihar may create 'arrogance' in NDA to akhir ye samjhauta hua kaise? iske peeche kai kaaran hai
 The first reason is that the BJP came to the conclusion that it cannot contest elections by shoring up Nitish

 But in the meantime, Bhupendra Yadav, who was responsible for talking to Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan and rlsp's Upendra Kushwaha, got busy with some other work of the party
 lekin nitish or bihar BJP ke netaa is baat par ekamat the ki agar upendra kushvaha janaa chahen to unke maan manouvval main samay kii barabaadi nahin kii jaae kyonki jis gathbandhan main pradhanmantri narendra modi or nitish kumaar honge use gair yadav voter khaaskar kushvaha voter kabhi duusari ore jaaenge

 filhal siton ke baraabar-baraabar samjhaute se ek baar phir is baat par muhar lagi he ki bihar main nitish kumaar duulhaa kii bhoomika main hi rahenge, bhale baraat main koi dal peeche khadaa ho
 So how did this compromise happen? Many reasons account for this
 pehali vajah to yah rahi ki bhaajapa tamaam maathapai kar is nattejey par pahunchi ki filhal nitish ko kinare kar chunaav nahin ladaa ja saktaa
 In this, the role of the ministers of Bihar BJP, especially ministers like Sushil Modi, Nand Kishore Yadav and Prem Kumar, is important, who maintains that going to the elections only with Paswan and Kushwaha can prove suicidal
 doosraa, bhaajapa ne ek se adhik surveykshan karaaye jisamen nitish ke saath jane par parinaam unke manamaafik aa rahe the, vahiin nitish ke bina vaale survey ke parinaam bahut anukool nahin the
 After all, Upendra Kushwaha, who is preparing to go to the court, will 'bargain for seats' with Amit Shah on Monday sabase pehle july maheene main amit shah se nitish kumaar bhojan par patna main mili to unhone ek maheene main siton kaa bantwaaraa puraa karne kaa vaada liya
 But the real conversation started in August with BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, Janata Dal United MP and Nitish's close RCP Singh and Minister Lalan Singh where the BJP appeared ready to give 15 seats, contrary to media reports
 isse pehle bhaajapa kii taraf se maatr 12 siten dene kii khabar aayi thi jise janata dal ne turant kaarij kar diya tha
 But the real equal formula itself, Nitish proposed after talking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which modi-shah accepted before 16 September
 isliye pehali baar apni party rajya kaaryakarini ke saamne 16 sitambar ko nitish ne kaha ki siton kaa samjhauta sammanjanak or party ke hit main hua he lekin isaki ghoshnaa uchit samay par BJP ke netaaon ke dwaara kii jaaegi
 Nitish was confident that whenever the seat agreement was announced, it would be based on an equal formula
 lekin is bich bhupendra yadav jinke jimme lok janashakti party ke netaa ramvilas paswan or ralospa ke upendra kushvaha se baatcheet karne kaa zimmaa tha, wo party ke kuch anya kaamon main vyast ho gayi
 But Nitish and Bihar BJP leaders were unanimous that if Upendra Kushwaha wants to go, then his mind should not be a waste of time because the alliance that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar will have will be made by non-yadav voters especially Kushwaha voters on the other hand
 Will go vishesh rup se mahagathbandhan kii ore jiskaa netritv tejasvi yadav ke haath main hoga, to bilkul hi nahin jaaenge
 But everyone was unanimous towards Paswan that he still has the ability to transfer Paswan voters so if his seats in the Lok Sabha are getting reduced then he should be replenished immediately by sending him to Rajya Sabha from any state
 lekin nitish ke saamne bhaajapa jhuki to uske peeche ye bhi ek factor rahaa ki jahaan dalit or agadi jatiyon main dalit act ko lekar naaraazgi bad rahi thi, lekin nitish ne kam se kam daliton ko kush karne ke liye kamobesh unki adhikansh maangon ko maanakar unke gusse ko thanda karne kii koshish kii
 After that BJP felt that even if Nitish is left, he may have to lose his hands with the Dalit votes
 gauratlab heki nitish kumaar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke baad naaraaz chal rahe the or wo kai maukon par dikhaa bhi
 Then whether in front of Prime Minister Modi publicly demanding that his Patna University be declared a Central University or last year after getting fifteen percent of the amount sought for flood relief
 endie main koi tarjeeh nahin die jane se bhi wo niraash the
 By giving them equal seats, Prime Minister Narendra Modi fulfilled a promise that the BJP would respect him in the political share before forming the government in July last year
 tippaniyan VIDEO: Agreement on seats in Bihar NDA nitish ne bhi unhen bharosa dilaayaa tha ki unhen pichley chunaav ke 31 siton se zyaada bihar se milengi
 In the coming few months, Nitish, who has more than 50 percent popularity in his survey against Tejashwi Yadav, will have to convert it into votes
 kyonki bihar main endie ke aadhaar vot ke do majboot stambh agadi jatiyaan bhaajapa or nitish se or dalit bhaajapa se naaraaz or niraash chal rahe hai
 As much as Nitish knows this truth, Sushil Modi too
 isliye endie ko bihar main aaj mahagathbandhan se zyaada chunauti patibaddh puraane votaron kii udaasi se mil rahi he
 At present, equal agreement of seats has once again confirmed that Nitish Kumar will remain in the role of groom in Bihar, even if a party is standing behind in the procession
 aakhir kis paale main jane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai upendra kushvaha, somvaar ko amit shah se karenge 'siton kii saudebaaji' First of all, Nitish Kumar met Amit Shah in Patna in the month of July, then he promised to fulfill the seat allocation in one month

 filhal siton ke baraabar-baraabar samjhaute se ek baar phir is baat par muhar lagi he ki bihar main nitish kumaar duulhaa kii bhoomika main hi rahenge, bhale baraat main koi dal peeche khadaa ho
 But the real equal formula itself, Nitish proposed after talking to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which modi-shah accepted before 16 September
 isliye pehali baar apni party rajya kaaryakarini ke saamne 16 sitambar ko nitish ne kaha ki siton kaa samjhauta sammanjanak or party ke hit main hua he lekin isaki ghoshnaa uchit samay par BJP ke netaaon ke dwaara kii jaaegi
 Nitish was confident that whenever the seat agreement was announced, it would be based on an equal formula
 lekin is bich bhupendra yadav jinke jimme lok janashakti party ke netaa ramvilas paswan or ralospa ke upendra kushvaha se baatcheet karne kaa zimmaa tha, wo party ke kuch anya kaamon main vyast ho gayi
 But Nitish and Bihar BJP leaders were unanimous that if Upendra Kushwaha wants to go, then his mind should not be a waste of time because the alliance that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar will have will be made by non-yadav voters especially Kushwaha voters on the other hand
 Will go vishesh rup se mahagathbandhan kii ore jiskaa netritv tejasvi yadav ke haath main hoga, to bilkul hi nahin jaaenge
 But everyone was unanimous towards Paswan that he still has the ability to transfer Paswan voters so if his seats in the Lok Sabha are getting reduced then he should be replenished immediately by sending him to Rajya Sabha from any state
 lekin nitish ke saamne bhaajapa jhuki to uske peeche ye bhi ek factor rahaa ki jahaan dalit or agadi jatiyon main dalit act ko lekar naaraazgi bad rahi thi, lekin nitish ne kam se kam daliton ko kush karne ke liye kamobesh unki adhikansh maangon ko maanakar unke gusse ko thanda karne kii koshish kii
 After that BJP felt that even if Nitish is left, he may have to lose his hands with the Dalit votes
 gauratlab heki nitish kumaar bhaajapa ke saath sarkaar banane ke baad naaraaz chal rahe the or wo kai maukon par dikhaa bhi
 Then whether in front of Prime Minister Modi publicly demanding that his Patna University be declared a Central University or last year after getting fifteen percent of the amount sought for flood relief
 endie main koi tarjeeh nahin die jane se bhi wo niraash the
 By giving them equal seats, Prime Minister Narendra Modi fulfilled a promise that the BJP would respect him in the political share before forming the government in July last year
 tippaniyan VIDEO: Agreement on seats in Bihar NDA nitish ne bhi unhen bharosa dilaayaa tha ki unhen pichley chunaav ke 31 siton se zyaada bihar se milengi
 In the coming few months, Nitish, who has more than 50 percent popularity in his survey against Tejashwi Yadav, will have to convert it into votes
 kyonki bihar main endie ke aadhaar vot ke do majboot stambh agadi jatiyaan bhaajapa or nitish se or dalit bhaajapa se naaraaz or niraash chal rahe hai
 As much as Nitish knows this truth, Sushil Modi too
 isliye endie ko bihar main aaj mahagathbandhan se zyaada chunauti patibaddh puraane votaron kii udaasi se mil rahi he
 At present, equal agreement of seats has once again confirmed that Nitish Kumar will remain in the role of groom in Bihar, even if a party is standing behind in the procession
 lekin nitish or bihar BJP ke netaa is baat par ekamat the ki agar upendra kushvaha janaa chahen to unke maan manouvval main samay kii barabaadi nahin kii jaae kyonki jis gathbandhan main pradhanmantri narendra modi or nitish kumaar honge use gair yadav voter khaaskar kushvaha voter kabhi duusari ore jaaenge
 Especially towards the grand alliance, which will be headed by Tejashwi Yadav, will not go at all
 lekin paswan ke prati sabhi log ek mat the ki abhi bhi unke paas paswan votaron ko transfar karaane kii kshamta qaayam he isliye agar loksabhaa main unki siten kam ho rahi hon to unhen rajyasabha kisi bhi rajya se bhej kar uski bharpai turant kii jaae
 But the BJP bowed in front of Nitish, and there was a factor behind it that while there was growing anger among Dalits and upper castes about the Dalit Act, Nitish at least gave up most of his demands to please the Dalits and his anger Tried to cool down
 uske baad BJP ko laga ki ab bhi agar nitish ko choda jaae to dalit voton se unhen haath dhonaa pad saktaa he
 Significantly, Nitish Kumar was angry after forming the government with BJP and he also showed it on many occasions
 phir chaahe pradhanmantri modi ke saamne saarvajanik rup se unki patna vishwa vidhyalay ko kendriya vishwa vidhyalay ghoshit karne kii maang ho yaa pichley saal baadh raahat ke liye maangi gayi raashi kaa pandrah pratishat milane ke baad kii naaraazgi
 He was also disappointed with the NDA not being given any preference
 unako baraabar-baraabar seat dekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley saal july main sarkaar banane ke purv apane ek vaade ko puraa kiya ki raajnneetik hissedari main bhaajapa unka maan sammaan rakhegi
 The comments VIDEO: bihar NDA main siton ko lekar samjhauta Nitish also assured him that he would get more than 31 seats from Bihar in the last election
 aane vaale kuch maheenon main nitish ko, jinke apane survey main tejasvi yadav ke muqaabale lokapriyata 50 pratishat se adhik he, use voton main tabdeel karke dikhaanaa hoga
 Because two strong pillars of the nda's Aadhar vote in Bihar are angry and disappointed with the forward castes BJP and Nitish and the Dalit BJP

 bollywood ke mahanatam kalakaaron main se ek dilip kumaar ke makaanon ke saath kuch acha nahin chal rahaa he
 Earlier, his brothers in Mumbai asked for a hefty amount in lieu of leaving the house, and now the landlord is asking for Rs 8 crore to make his ancestral house in Pakistan a national heritage
 dilip kumaar peshawar ke rahane vaale hai or vahaan unka pushtaini makaan tha
 Akram Ullah, the owner of that house, had asked for three and a half crores of rupees from the government to make it a heritage
 baad main uskaa laalach bad gaya or usne 8 karod rupye maang liye
 Actually Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has recently declared Dilip Kumar's house as a national heritage
 iske pahal prantiy sarkaar bhi use dharohar bananaa chaahati thi or akram se baat kii thi
 At that time he had asked for two crore rupees but later raised this amount to three and a half crores
 lekin ab usne yah raashi badhaakar 8 karod rupee kar di he
 But now the government has become angry
 vahaan ke samskruti vibhaag ke ek afasar ne kaha ki agar akram ne sahi keemat nahin lagaai to sarkaar us makaan kaa adhigrahan kar legi kyonki use rashtriya dharohar ghoshit kar diya gaya he
 Not only this, the provincial government has the right to acquire any old building for repair
 dilip kumaar kaa yah pushtaini makaan teen manjila makaan ab jarjar avasthaa main he

 unhone kaha, ‘sabhi rajnatik dalon or khaastaur par badi partiyon ko sachet rahanaa chahie
 Kejriwal had earlier targeted Vadra, son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi, for land deals in Haryana

 GST was entangled since the day the Central Government gave up its intention to make GST as it should have been
 natijatan, sansad ke gatirodh ko teji se paar kar jane vaala jiesti dhimaa padataa hua tal gaya he
 July is the next deadline which looks harder than April

 This was the beginning of the craze of the cess as if the central government is not willing to give up the greed to impose tax on tax then why should the state lag behind? The new budget is being built in the shadow of the delayed GST which will prepare the land of GST
 ham nae ses or tex kii taraf badhen, isse pehle yah jaananaa jaruri he ki bharat main ses kaa makadzaal kitna jatil he

 The CAG states that the government neither created any fund nor gave this money to any scheme for its use

 It has won almost 90 per cent of the seats so far declared in the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament
 chunaav adhikariyon ne abhi eneldi ko aadhikarik taur par vijeta ghoshit nahin kiya he
 Despite the results which are seen coming, the balance of power in Myanmar is expected to be redesigned
 yahaan pichley 50 saal se se sena tathaa uske sahyogi satta par haaavee rahe hai
 Sui Chi's supporters remain concerned about how the military will react to these election results
 unki chintaa vaazib bhi he, kyonki 1990 main eneldi ne jeet darj kii thi lekin sena ne is loktantr samarthak party ko satta se upekshit kar diya tha
 In a letter to President Thein Sein, the list of long-time bars seeking democracy, said, "citizens have expressed their will in this election

 paak piem (imran Khan) ke is bayaan par congress pravaktaa randeep surajevaala (randeep Surjewala) or pidipi adhyaksh mahabuuba mufti (mehbooba Mufti) ne kadi pratikriya di he
 Please tell that Pak PM (imran Khan) had said that if PM Modi becomes PM once again after Lok Sabha elections, then the path of dialogue between the two countries can open once again

 Now on this statement of Imran Khan, politics has started in the country
 congress samet kai vipakshi partiyon ne imran khan ke is bayaan ko lekar bijepi par hamalaa kiya he
 Mufti Sb too like Pak PM believed that Modi a BJP PM backed by right wing could carry forward process of dialogue initiated by Vajpayee ji
 Cong couldn't do so as it feared backlash from BJP & other right wing parties 
 But Modi despite a huge mandate frittered away that chance
 PDP President Mehbooba Mufti made a tweet after the Pakistan pm's statement
 unhone likhaa ki mufti sahab bhi pakistan ke piem kii tarah hi yah maanate thi ki modi jise dakshinpanthi takaton kaa samarthan praapt he vaajapeyi ji dwaara shuru kiye baatcheet ke peshkash ko aage badhayenge

 2018 ke agast main pradhanmantri bane imran khan ne kaha ki modi ke shashan main kashmir hi nahin, puure bharat main musalmaan bade paimaane par algaav mahasoos kar rahe hai
 He said that i can never imagine what is happening in India at the moment
 muslim hone kii vajah se un par hamale ho rahe hai
 He said that like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, PM Modi is campaigning on the basis of 'fear and nationalist sentiment'
 unhone kaha ki is saptaah bhaajapa ne jammu-kashmir ke logon se dashakon puraane vishesh adhikaron kaa prastaav ko khatm karne kaa sankalp liya he, jiske tahat kisi bahari vyakti ke rajya main sampatti kharidne par pratibandh he, yah ek badi chintaa he
 However, he also said that it could be just an election stunt
 imran khan ne bharat ko ek jaitoon shakha dene kii peshkash karte hue kaha ki islamabad desh ke sabhi pakistan sthit aatanki samoohon ko khatm karne ke liye drudh sankalpit he or is kaarykram ke liye sarkaar ko pakistan kii shaktishaalee sena kaa puraa samarthan tha
 Those to be demolished include groups in Kashmir

 Military power cannot solve this issue

 Now a circular of the Director General of Maharashtra Police has not only come as an expectation but also seems to be effective
 mumbai police ke vanaraai police thane main aisi hi dhokhadhadi kii shikaayat par mopha kanoon ke tahat maamla darj hua he
 Deshbandhu Gupta, Khushiram Gupta, Nilesh Gupta and Aur Lodha have been named in this first case of its kind under the Maharashtra Honorship Flat Act of 1963
 shikayatakarta praveen agarwal ke mutabik unhone apni shikaayat main lodha bilders ke partner mangalaprabhat, abhishek or abhinandan lodha kaa naam likhaa tha
 But the police do not know why Lodha was just written in the FIR? Let it be known that Mangalprabhat Lodha is an MLA of the ruling party BJP in Maharashtra
 haalanki lodha group ne ek bayaan jari kar safai di he ki is vivaad se unka koi naata nahin he
 The mall was already built on the land on which the Hub Mall was built and the complainant Praveen Aggarwal did not have any deal with him
 tippaniyan The company also says that Praveen Aggarwal owns the Hub Mall, not a flat

 Meanwhile the builder started building a 60-storey three-storey tower named 'lodha Fiorenza' next to the society
 jise banane ke liye sosayadi kii ennesai kaa istemaal kiya gaya jo avaidh he
 According to complainant Praveen Aggarwal, he wrote the names of Lodha Builders' partners Mangalprabhat, Abhishek and Abhinandan Lodha in their complaint
 lekin police ne pataa nahin kyon exiaar main sirf lodha naam likhaa? gyaat ho ki mangalaprabhat lodha maharashtra main sattadhari dal bijepi ke vidhayak hai
 However, the Lodha Group has issued a statement clarifying that they have nothing to do with the dispute
 hub mal jis jameen par bana he us jameen kii malikana haq vaali company ke adhigrahan ke pehle hi mal ban chukaa tha or shikayatakarta praveen agarwal se unka koi sauda nahin hua he
 The comments company kaa ye bhi kahana he ki praveen agarwal kisi flats ke nahin balki hub mal ke maalik hai
 That is, it is a business dispute and not a builder and a flat buyer

 jinaki hatya kar di gai thi Admission process is going on in Delhi University (DU)
 isi bich khilaadi or kalamand students ke liye ek acchhee khabar ai he
 DU colleges can increase the sanctioned seats in ECA and sportspersons quota at the department level
 lekin isamen dhyaan rakhana hoga ki kisi bhi tarah ECA Sports cote ke daakhile kii paanch pratishat kii seemaa bhang na ho
 This is change
 Until last year, this rule was applicable only for ECA category, which will be applicable for sports quota this year
 naye badlaav ke tahat koi bhi college apane kul student kii sankhya ke aadhaar par adhiktam paanch fisadi siten isie cote main de saktaa he
 But if a department does not fill the seats to be filled in these coats, then it can transfer the vacant seats to another department
 milegaa zyada maukaaise naye niyam ke anusaar yadi koi student sanis main isie category se daakhila lene vaala nahin he to ye siten humenities main transfar ho sakati hai, lekin isamen kahin bhi vishvavidhyalay ke kul paanch fisadi vaala niyam nahin tootna chahie
 a senior official associated with the admission process says that it is often seen that students opt for Humanities or Social Science instead of choosing Science to take admission from ECA or Sports category
 aise main yadi science kii siten is taraf transfar ho jaaengi to student ko zyada maukey milenge
 This decision was taken in the meeting on Monday
 donon koton se sabhi siten bharne kii taiyaarmbhi jo niyam he usamen sabhi Sports or isie kii siten nahin bhar paati thim
 Because of this it has been decided that it can be doubled at the subject level
 mana angreji onors main cote kii paanch siten hai or urdu onors main bhi 5 siten hai
 If no student is found in Urdu, then these seats can be transferred to English Honors so that five others, ie 10 students in total, can enroll in English
 yahaan dhyaan rakhana hoga ki class kii kul siton kii 10% se zyada ye siten nahin ho sakati
 Let us know that there are more than 3 thousand seats in sports and ECA quota in DU, which are being prepared to fill this year

 The BJD called the strike against the central government for the huge increase in petrol / diesel prices and other basic necessities
 lekin bijedy dwaara bulaae gaye is band ko apane hi ek saansad ke virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The BJD MP from Kendrapada, Jai Panda, pounced on the party workers for stopping the ambulance and the mistreatment of women during the strike
 mukhyamantri naveen patnayak or pandas main sheet yudhapakon bataa den ki jai pandas or party pramukh mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ke bich sheet yuddh kii khabaren aati rahi hai
 Not only this, there are also reports that Jayjay Panda wants to join BJP
 hadtaal ke dauraan soshal media par bijedy ke kaaryakartaaon dwaara kahin ambulance rokane to kahin mahilaon ke saath durvyavhaar kii tasviren saamne ain
 Jai Panda also expressed displeasure over these activities of party workers on social media and said that he would have been very sad today if the party founder Biju Patnaik were there
 jai pandas ne naaraazgi jaahir karte hue soshal media par likhaa, "yah bahut hi sharmnaak ghatana he or aisi ghatnaon ke khilaaf vah khud ko is hadtaal se alag karte hai
 "jai Panda has also demanded stern action against party workers who are seen to be indecent in the photographs
 itnaa hi nahin unhone mukhyamantri naveen patnayak ke khilaaf bhi hallaa bol diya or likhaa, "yah wo party nahin he, jise maine naveen patnayak ke saath apane 20 saal die
 i am ashamed and angry with this incident

 The Kiwi team started in the morning with a good score of 248 runs for four wickets but despite Jesse Ryder's 70 runs, the rest of his six wickets got out within 102 runs

 newjiland ne subah chaar wicket par 258 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya, lekin jahir ne use jald hi do karaare jatke diye
 In this sense, Rider's half-century was very important for New Zealand
 jahir ne din ke tisare over main hopakins ko pagabaadha out karke bharat ko apekshit shuruyaat dilaayi 
 Hopkins felt that the ball was going out and so he raised his hand to release it but the ball hit his pad in front of the wickets taking a swing
 jahir ne phir se round da wicket gendbaaji karte hue williamson ko bhi pagabaadha out kiya
 Harbhajan, who has been consistently unsuccessful in bowling, showed his brilliance after this
 unhone vittori ko pagabaadha out karne ke baad rider ko pehali slip main vivies lakshmana ke haathon kaich karaayaa
 The left-handed batsman made good starts with centuries from Tim mcintos and Martin Guptill, but India made a good comeback due to falling wickets from the other end
