 While capsicum and beans are priced at Rs 80 per kg, banded cabbage, okra and chilli are priced at Rs 60 per kg
 jabaki aalu 20 rupee prati kilogram he
 If you are thinking that the prices of vegetables are increasing only by retail shopkeepers, then look at the successful store
 safal stores main aamtaur par subjiyan sasti milti hai, kyonki yahaan bich kaa margin nahin hota
 Tomatoes are also available in successful Delhi stores at Rs 70 per kg and onions at Rs 50 per kg

 But in this country it should also be remembered that the nature of crime is the consideration
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki devayani kii desh se baahar chale jane kaa jokhim bhi uski giraftaar kaa kaaran ho saktaa he

 In Shopian last week, militants shot an apple car and its truck drivers from Punjab
 trek chaalak kii maut ho gai thi, jabaki uskaa sahaayak ghayal ho gaya tha
 a recession or a prolonged economic decline is not only bad because it breaks us, but more important is how it leaves us
 atharah maheene se jari yah mandi kab thamegi, iske sanket milane abhi baaki hai
 The next quarter may be more difficult, but by the time the recession is over, competition in the Indian market will have left us with more or less
 • mobile network chaahe jitne ghatiya hon lekin agle kuch maah main hamen shaayad do companiyon main ek ko chunanaa hoga
 bsnl's disease is incurable
 mandi ke bich vodaphone-idia sankat main he yani ki telecom seva main pratispardhaa aakhri saansen le rahi he
 • There will not be many options in the smart phone market too
 vahaan bhi china or korea kii do companiyaan kareeb 50 fisadi bazaar hissaa kabja chuki hai
 Domestic companies were no longer counted
 • pichley saat saal main sabase bura vakt dekh rahe vimaanan udyog main jet airways kii vidaai ke baad ab pratispardhaa sirf do companiyon ke bich simat gai he
 • In 2015, more than a dozen e-commerce companies were playing goose in India but now the entire retail (online and store) market has now completely gone to two US companies

 After the recent decline in the stock market, now only two or three players will be left
 bhartiya bazaar pehle se hi ekadhikaron or companiyon kii mileebhagat kaa dard jhel rahaa he
 The government has a monopoly in large areas like coal, petro fuel, electricity grid, power generation
 indian oil jald hi bharat petroleum kaa adhigrahan kar legi yani ki petro udyog main pratispardhaa or simat jaaegi
 There are between one to three companies (private or government) in about a dozen industries or services, including steel, two-wheelers, plastics, aluminum, trucks and buses, cargo, railways, road transport, many major consumer products
 lambii khinchati mandi pratispardhaa ke liye sabase badi sajaa kaa elaan he
 Ways to fight recession are very limited
 udyog sarkaar se madad kii ummid karte hai lekin jab sarkaar ke paas kharch badhaane yaa tex ghataane ke maukey nahin (jaisaa ki ab he) hote to udyogon ke paas keemat kam karne kaa aakhri vikalp bachataa he
 This last effort is starting in the country in view of festive weather
 magar thahrie, keemten kam hone se halaat badal nahin jaaenge
 There is a danger of starting a vicious cycle from here
 yah mandi keemten oonchi hone kii vajah se nahin he
 Inflation is at the lowest level
 jiesti kam hua he
 Recession is due to non-increase of income
 logon ke paas bachat nahin he, isliye khapat nahin badi
 Experiences in other markets of the world show that only big companies can survive in this competition when companies slash prices in times of recession
 kyonki mandi ke bich keemat ghataakar uskaa asar jhelane kii kshamta sabhi companiyon main nahin hoti
 Telecom is an example of this, where companies died due to lower prices
 pichley chah-saat varshon main, bhartiya bazaar main pratirsdha sikud gai he
 Aggressive mergers, acquisitions and debt of foreign companies have led to the closure of large-scale companies
 notebandi, jiesti ne majholi companiyon ko sikodkar sthaneey bazaaron main pratispardhaa ko bhi simit kar diya, jisaki vajah se kai local brands khet rahe
 It is said that it took five decades for American capitalism to return after the recession
 bharat bhi jab is mandi se ubregaa to yahaan kai kshetron main pratispardhaa simat chuki hogi
 Companies always want a monopoly
 google-fasebuk vaali nai duniya to vaise hi ekadhikaar se pareshaan he
 Companies' monopolies are also favorable to governments because politics-corporate alliances run smoothly
 license permit raaj main yahi to hota tha
 But this has to be questioned, because the economy needs open competition
 simit pratispardhaa vaale kshetron main nai companiyon ke pravesh kii niti jaruri he
 There should be five to six big and innumerable small companies in every sector
 isse nivesh aayega or rojgaar bhi

 Pradeep has once represented this seat
 2014 ke chunaav main bhaajapa ne is rajya kii 14 main se 12 siton par jeet hasil kii thi
 In the Modi wave, the Congress, JVM and RJD were defeated badly
 lekin is baar congress, jeemem, jhavimo or rajd milakar bhaajapa ko kadi chunauti de rahe hai
 Barring three Chatra, Koderma and Hazaribagh in 14 seats, a face-to-face contest for the remaining 11 seats is a big challenge for the BJP

 The Congress, which is in the Grand Alliance, is contesting on 7, JMM, JVM 2 and RJD 1 seats

 In 2014, Ravindra Rai was the state president of the BJP
 tab is rajya kii 12 siton par bhaajapa ne jeet hasil kii thi or vidhansabha chunaavon main endie ko bahumat ke saath jharkhand main sarkaar banane kaa mauka mila tha

 is chunaav main unka muqabla jhavimo adhyaksh babulal marandi or sipii-maale ke raaj kumaar yadav se he
 Babulal, the state's first chief minister, has represented this seat twice in the past
 raaj kumaar pichhali baar bhi ladaai main rahe the or doosraa sthaan paaya tha
 Annapurna may have to bear the brunt of the bjp's Ravindra Rai ticket being disgruntled by his Swatantra Bhumihar voters and the sharing of Yadav votes

 The Khunti parliamentary constituency is important this time because Kadia Munda, who was elected eight times from here, also did not get the ticket on the basis of age
 unki jagah par bhaajapa ne teen baar mukhyamantri or ek baar saansad rah chuke bade adivasee netaa arjuna munda ko utaara he
 Kali Charan Munda of Congress is challenging him
 kaali charan rajya kii bhaajapa sarkaar main mantri nilkanth singh munda ke bade bhai hai or ek baar vidhansabha kaa chunaav jeetne kaa anubhav rakhte hai

 Bal Thackeray, who had the power to transform the financial capital of the country into a silence with a gesture of his finger, started his career as a cartoonist with RK Laxman in the English daily Free Press Journal in the late 1950s, but In 1960, he started a new path by launching the cartoon weekly 'marmik'

 Thackeray's pro-marathi mantra worked and his saying that 'maharashtra belongs to the Marathis' became so popular among the locals that his party formed a different opinion in the presidential election in 2007 despite having an old alliance with the BJP And supported UPA presidential candidate Pratibha Patil, who was from Maharashtra
 unhone 2009 main sachin tendulkar kii aalochana kar daali, jinhone kaha tha ki mumbai puure bharat kii he

 unke inhen prayaason ne unhen 'hindu hriday samraat' bana diya
 Though Thackeray himself never contested any election, it sowed the seeds of making the Shiv Sena a full-fledged political party when his Shiv Sainiks began to control trade unions in various industries, including Bollywood
 shivasena ne jald hi apni jaden jamaa leen or 1980 ke dashak main marathi samarthak mantra ke sahare brihanmumbai nagar nigam par kabja kar liya

 Thackeray, who changed the direction of Maharashtra's politics in every way, always gave his friends and opponents the opportunity to underestimate him politically, so that he could execute his intentions cleanly

 For some, this lion of Maharashtra was a cultural ideal in itself

 The Shiv Sena soon gained its roots and took over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in the 1980s with the support of the pro-marathi mantra

 shivasena ne jald hi apni jaden jamaa leen or 1980 ke dashak main marathi samarthak mantra ke sahare brihanmumbai nagar nigam par kabja kar liya

 However, he never held the post of Chief Minister

 Bal Thackeray, who has the ability to understand the pulse of 'marathi Manus' very well, was a firm supporter of the saying that disrespect grows more closely and that is why he always described himself as the best

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, speaking with ndtv's Vikram Chandra during HT Leadership Summit, stated the government's stand on the issue of demonetisation or demonetisation
 
 
 agar aap desh kii 86 pratishat cash karency ko badalanaa chaahate hai, to uskaa ek bada hissaa aapako pehle se taiyaar rakhana zaruri thadesh main karency kii kami na ho, isliye 2,000 rupee ke note pehle chaape gaenotbandi kii prakriya ek din kii nahin he, so, har rose halaat dekhakar ranneeti main badlaav kar rahe hanyah kuch maheene main ho jane vaali prakriya bhi nahin he, isamen kahin zyaada vakt lagata he, isliye taiyaari bahut pehle shuru ho jaani chahie
 The government and RBI have been insisting on being prepared
 noton ke vitaran ke liye bank or atm khaasi taadaad main hai, isliye na sirf chapai kii taiyaari puri honi chahie, balki unhen sabhi jagahon par pahunchane or baantne kii vyavastha bhi honi hi chahie
 So, you can understand how big this process is
 isamen gopneeyata banaae rakhane ke saath-saath yah bhi sunishchit karnaa tha ki zaruri jaankaree samay par sabhi ko milti rahe
 When you have a very large population, the lines will be connected, but people have given excellent support
 desh main kisi tarah kaa saamaajik tanaav paidaa nahin hua
 You are taking the country towards digital currency, the same is happening
 aupchaarik kaarobaar, vyapaar kii maatra badhegi, lekin kaagazi mudra kam ho jaaegi
 Debit cards and e-wallets will be used instead of the rest
 notebandi ke baad pehle jitani kaagazi mudra nahin rahegi
 There are currently 23 crore e-wallets in the country
 raajnneeti or media main is par vishwaas karnaa mushkil he, lekin desh hamaari ummiido kii tulana main kahin tezi se badal rahaa he
 We will continue to be the fastest growing economy this year
 yah kadam (notebandi) rajnatik funding ko kahin zyaada paardarshee bana degaa
 Technology cannot be stopped, the digitization of the economy will remain

 According to Mahesh Sharma, the share of tourism in the country's economy is 10%
 aise main kai baar paryatakon ke liye hotalon ke kamare bhi kam pad jate hai
 There has been a 15 percent increase in the number of domestic tourists in the country and a seven percent increase in the number of foreign tourists
 pradhanmantri narendra modi jin-jin deshon kii yatra karke aaye vahaan se aane vaale paryatakon kii taadaad main paanch se 45 fisadi kii badhotaree hui he
 In view of this trend, more than one and a half lakh rooms are needed in all the range hotels
 lekin desh main aisa infrastracchar taiyaar nahin he
 This summit of Central Government Finance Corporation and CII are also helpful, because now tourism is not limited to just travel, but now religious tourism, medical tourism, wellness and healing with nature tourism, adventure i

 rahul gandhi kahaan hai, ye sawaal aaj dilli se loksabhaa main bijepi ke saansad ramesh vidhudi ne uthaaya
 Vidhuri said that Rahul Gandhi is a national level leader and the country has the right to know where he is and with whom he has gone
 vaise bahut saare log yah jaanane ke liye utsuk honge ki rahul kahaan hai
 Now even journalists have stopped speculating
 bijepi ke taraf se aisa sawaal jab haryana ke saansad ashvini minna ne sansadeey kaary mantri venkaiya naidu se jab poocha ki ve bhi rahul gandhi kahaan hai, iskaa sawaal loksabhaa main uthaanaa chaahate hai, to venkaiya ne unhen manaa kar diya
 Why does the question arise? Now look at the politics of Congress in recent times
 rahul hai nahin, mudda bhoomi adhigrahan kaa he or vipaksh puure takat se sarkaar ke naak main dam kiye hue he
 Initially, when this news came, it was felt that the Congress would go in a relaxed manner, because what would the army do without the commander
 magar tabhi purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke khilaaf koyala block aanvaton maamle main adaalat kaa saman aayaa or isane congress ko ekajute kar diya
 Sonia Gandhi took command and marched with her leaders to Manmohan Singh's house and expressed full confidence in Manmohan Singh
 congress kii taraf se kaha gaya ki desh ke bade vakil manmohan singh kii pairvi karegein
 Then, Congress leaders vied for attacking the government, both inside and outside Parliament on land acquisition
 jantar mantar yaa sansad maarg kii raily par police ke saamne prardashan karne or water canan khaane main bhi congress netaa hichak nahin rahe hai
 The leaders whom you would never have seen speaking on TV are giving fiery speeches at Jantar Mantar, that is, all the Congress leaders fear that the Congress regime is about to change and the seat they need to sit in Rahul's bogey
 It is necessary to sweat the roads for reservation
 yahi vajah he ki kisi bhi dharna main yaa sansad ke andar virodh main kahin bhi rahul gandhi kii kami mahasoos nahin hui
 On the contrary, its effect was felt even more

 At the same time, China has never been in partnership with anyone, but to avoid outside influence, it sometimes resorted to wall or iron curtain
 isi se nirdhaarit hota he in donon deshon kaa diene jisase saaf hota he ki china ke diene main aisi khamiyaan he ki uske netritv main kisi gathjod par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 When it comes to CPEC or OBOR, it becomes more important that if China is to be trusted then the effect will have to bear for hundreds of years
 aaie jaanate hai kyon CPEC yaa OBOR ke paksh main nahin khadaa ho saktaa he bharat1
 OBOR is a big threat to the world because it is the first attempt from China, which is going to affect the whole world for the next hundreds of years
 OBOR ke jariye china asia or europe ke liedred root nirdhaarit karne kii taiyarimen he

 china duniya kaa sabase bada manuphaccharing hub he or OBOR kii sthapana ho jane ke baad uske liye apana manuphacchard maal puure europe or asia main vitarit karnaa aasaan or phydemand ho jayega
 At the same time, the rest of the countries of Asia and Europe have to first challenge China in manufacturing to use this network
 ise bhi padhein: china ko daraa rahi hai bharat kii ye paanch uplabdhiyaan3
 The US has openly opposed this OBOR project from China
 haalanki europe philhal is mudde par chup he or vah is project main apane liye aarthik punargathan ke maukey talash rahaa he
 Its priority is to accelerate the slowing European economy

 The Pakistan phase of this Chinese project is proposed to go through the territory of cpec-occupied Kashmir
 lihaaja is project se bharat kaa kashmir par samprabhu adhikaar kaa hanan hoga
 Any kind of approval by CPEC will not only weaken India's claim on Pak Occupied Kashmir but will also move a part of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir from CPEC Corridor out of Pakistan's sphere of influence
 ise bhi padhein: china ko pachhaadne ke liye uttar pradesh kaa gujarat bananaa jaruri5
 In the last 3-4 decades, China has included its economy among the largest economies of the world by manufacturing
 iske baavjood china ko vaishvik str par ahmiyat isliye nahin mil paati kyonki usne aarthik vikaas ke liye pashchimi technology ke prototip or sasti manuphaccharing ke sahare yah mukaam hasil kiya he
 However, this is the first time that through OBOR, China is trying to establish its credibility at the ideological level for the first time globally
 haalanki china kii is koshish ke khatarnaak parinaam aane vaale dashakon main dekhne ko mil sakate hai

 maujuuda vaishvik raajnneeti main ek sachai yah bhi he ki china jis kshetra main kaam karne ke liye kisi desh ke saath partnership karata he, kuch hi samay main us kshetra main china apana varchasv kaayam karne kii manshaa rakhata he
 For example, the way the port project was intercepted between China and Sri Lanka recently is enough to explain China's view

 The Coal Minister of the UPA Government, Mr
 Prakash Singh Jaiswal, surrounded by allegations of coal scam, has given a strange statement in his defense
 unka kahana he ki desh main na maaloom kitne ghotaale hote rahete hai
 In fact, when reporters asked him about the coal block allocation scam, he said, it does not matter whether the scams happened or not
 mahatv is baat kaa he ki ghotaale kii aahat hote hi, kya hamaari sarkaar ne jo ehtiyaati kadam uthaane chahie the, uthaae yaa nahin uthaae
 If raised, no one knows how many scams are happening in the country
 kaig ne gujarat or madhya pradesh main bhi ghotaalon ko ujagar kiya
 Did the governments of these states take any action
 par hamaari sarkaar ne ehtiyaati kadam uthaae jisaki nigaraanee supreme court kar rahaa he, sibiai jaanch kar rahi he
 After this, when he was asked about the missing files of Colgate, he said, 'you are not the Supreme Court that i should answer you
 'aapako bataa den ki koyala mantri buudhvaar ko sant kabir nagar main congress kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karne gaye the
 During this time, he said, 'if chaos spreads in countries of 10-20 crores, then maybe the army and police should handle that situation
 ham kah nahin sakate
 But if chaos spreads in the country of 125 crores, then who will handle it
 iskaa jawaab hamen chahie
 Neither the police has the strength to handle it
 na sena main wo dam he ki wo sambhaal sake
 Therefore, there should not be anarchy in this country of 125 crores

 ' Love is not the name of a relationship but a feeling
 yah kab, kyon, kaise, kahaan or kisase ho jaae isaki na to koi guarantee he or na hi koi formula
 Javed's account was just what he loved
 prem rupi yah ahsaas javed ke liye tha, uski premika ke liye bhi
 But the border of the country probably does not understand this love
 or samajhe bhi kyon akhir sarhad kaa arth hi bantwaaraa he, seemaa he
 You must have seen the love of love and its punishment on the screen
 taaliyaan bajaai hogi or geet par jhume bhi honge
 But real life is different from the curtain
 yahaan prem kii sajaa milti he or haa, yahaan filmon kii tarah ant main sab thik nahin hota
 Javed fell in love and was taken away as a punishment for love by the precious eleven-and-a-half years of his life
 mohababt tohamat bana di gai or pyaar main desh se gaddari kaa rang ghol diya gaya
 He was a lover, but a master of the times pushed him behind bars as an agent of the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI
 rampur ke javed kii kahani bas yahi he
 The story of eleven and a half years which he cut in the boundary wall without any lime
 wo karachi kaa safar
 
 
 Born in a common poor house, Javed left his studies and was learning TV repair work
 javed apane maa-baap or bhai bahan ke saath rah rahaa tha
 Javed was around 18 at the time
 tabhi 1999 main javed kii jindagi main ek nayaa mode aata he
 He was going to Karachi, Pakistan for the first time with his siblings to introduce his mother to their relatives
 varsh 1999 main bharat-paak ke rishton main puri tarah kadavaahat aa chuki thi
 At the beginning of the year, there was tremendous tension on the border of both the countries
 paak main baithe aatanki pakistani sena kii madad se bhartiya seemaa main ghuspaith kar rahe the
 The Pak army was plotting to capture Siachen and at the same time Javed was preparing to go to Pakistan with his family
 pehali baar phone par suni thi wo awazpakistan jane se pehle javed kii karachi main rishtedaar ke ghar kai baar phone par baatcheet hoti thi
 During this time, he got in love with a voice on the phone
 wo aawaaj karachi main rahane vaali javed kii dur kii rishtedaar mubina urf gudiya kii thi
 Guddu i
e
 Javed was completely arrested in the love of Gudiya
 vija kii sari kavayad puri karne ke baad aakhirkaar farvari 1999 main javed karachi pahunchataa he
 He is face to face with the doll
 donon main pyaar badhata he or tamaam kasme-vaadon ke bich javed kuch maheene baad hindustan laut aata he
 The love story of the two climbs thereafter
 khaton or phone kaa silsilaa chal padataa he
 Love between Urdu and Hindi was a special thing between the lovers, that Javed does not know Urdu and Gudiya does not know Hindi
 javed ne apane do doston taj mohammad or makasuud se madad maangi
 Both of them would not only write the letter to the doll in Urdu but also read the letter written in the Urdu to the doll
 isi bich 2001 main khaas gudiya se milane guddu dobaaraa karachi jaataa he
 He promises the doll that he will bring her to Hindustan by marrying soon
 donon ke ghar waalon ko bhi is rishte se koi etraj nahin tha
 
 
 
 or kahani ne lee karvatgudiya se shaadi kaa vaada kar guddu rampur laut aayaa
 Then on 13 August 2002 it happens that not only Guddu i
e
 Javed and his family but also the entire Rampur city are shocked
 uttar pradesh estf yani special task force kii team javed or uske donon doston taj mohammad or makasuud ko rampur se uthaa leti he
 It is said that at that time Javed was doing TV repair at the shop
 javed ko police dwaara uthaane ke teen din baad achaanak akhabaaron main khabar aati he ki iesai agent javed do saathiyon ke saath giraftaar
 It is also reported that a map of Bareilly Cantonment Army Force has been recovered from them
 ye khabar javed ke ghar waalon par bam kii tarah girti he, kyonki ab tak unhen lag rahaa tha ki javed ko kisi ne agava kar liya he
 According to the paper made on blank paper, he had no idea who and where the people who carried it were taken
 use gajiabad ke najadik do din tak rakhaa jaataa he
 During this time all the atrocities are done on him
 khaali paper par dastakhat karaae jate hai or tisare tin police use lekar rampur ke ganj thana pahunchati he
 Then for the first time, Javed and his family learns that Javed was not kidnapped, but was picked up by the police in plain uniform
 estf puure teen din tak javed ko gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se hiraasat main rakhti he par uski giraftaar nahin dikhaati
 a number of cases are filed against Javed, including treason and war against the nation
 iske saath hi us par bareli, meerut, dehradun or rudki main sena se judi khufia jaankaree iesai ko dene kaa sangeen iljaam lagaaya jaataa he
 a map of the hand-held Bareilly Cantonment near STF Javed also shows the seizure and claims that the map was faxed by Javed to Pakistan
 javed par iljaam laga ki wo khat ke jariye code verde main khufia jaankaree pakistan bhejtaa tha
 STF also presented the call to Karachi through Javed as proof
 pyaar ke alphaaj ko aatanki code verde batayadarasal javed ke funsane kii do ahm vajah thi
 The first is a continuous Karachi call from Rampur and the second is a love letter written in Urdu
 police ne jis code verde kaa zikr kiya vah j or m tha
 That is, Javed and Mubina
 ek pakistani ladki se mohabbat karne kii aisi sajaa milegi iskaa ahsaas javed or uske ghar waalon ko ab pehali baar ho rahaa tha
 Javed's lawyer Mohammad Jalaluddin says, "the photograph map was presented in the name of proof, while Javed is the fourth pass
 ' giraftaar ke kareeb dedh maheene baad javed par ek or sangeen dhara jad di gai
 He was punched
 2002 main endie sarkaar kii taraf se laayaa gaya wo kanoon jo sandigdh aatankwaadiyon ko lekar jaanch agency ko bepanaah adhikaar detii thi
 Javed's father, Mohammad Shafiq, says, "as soon as Pota began, lawyers started asking for one lakh fees
 'padosiyon or rishtedaaron ne kiya kinaararampur kaa guddu ab kanoonee pannon main deshadrohi or iesai agent tha
 Leave your neighbors, even your friends away from Javed's family
 javed kaa cese rampur se muradabad court transfar ho gaya
 Now on every muscle, the whole family would go from Rampur to Moradabad
 ghar main kamaane vaala bas ek boodha baap or adaalat main taarikh par taarikh
 Time was passing
 duusari taraf sarhad paar kii jis mohabbat kii vajah se javed aashiq se agent bana tha, wo mohabbat bhi usase dur hoti gai
 Javed's relationship with Mubina was almost broken
 mubina ko javed kii giraftaar kii khabar mili bhi yaa nahin ye bhi use nahin pataa tha
 The court released, but
 
 
 samay bitta gaya or insaaf kii dagar lambii hoti chali gai
 Examination of the diary and map found from Javed and colleagues proved that handwriting is not Javed's
 pakistan ke jin phone numberon kaa hawala dekar javed ko iesai agent bataaya gaya wo saare number bhi pakistan main aam logon ke nikle
 Therefore, the court released Javed on 18 January 2014, terming the entire case as a no-evidences case
 lekin is rihaai se pehle javed ko saadhe gyaarah lambey saal jail main bitaane pade
 During this time his younger sister grew up
 teen bhaaiyon kii shaadi ho gai
 The parents became old and old
 police ne baat karne se kiya inkaarjaved ke is cese ke bare main upi police baat nahin karnaa chaahati
 Despite all our efforts, the police refused to talk
 beshak javed ab aaazaad he
 He has been released
 par uski jindagi ke wo anmol saadhe gyaarah saal kya koi use lautaa paaegaa? wo beetaa hua vakt use koi de paaegaa? shaayad nahin
 never
 aaj bhi nahin bhuulaa wo pyargel kii sakht deevaaron ke peeche saadhe gyaarah saal gujaarne ke baad bhi javed apni gudiya ko nahin bhuulaa he
 He loves her the same even today
 lekin haa ab pakistan jane kii uski himmat tut chuki he
 He has decided that he will never go to Pakistan now
 kabhi nahin
 Libyan Ambassador to South Africa, Abdullah Aljubaidi, has called on his leader Muammar Gaddafi to resign
 duniya bhar main kai libian rajanyikon dwaara kazzaphi kaa saath chhodane ke baad aljubaidi ne bhi virdohi tevar akhriyaar kar liye hai
 Libya's UN mission has supported sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the Gaddafi government
 aljubaidi ne kaha ki vah or pretoria sthit duutavas ke anya karmchaaree istipha dene ke bare main soch rahe the, lekin libian janata ke hiton ko dekhte hue pad na chhodane kaa faisla kiya
 He said, 'I want Gaddafi to step down because it is in the interest of Libyans

 ’ Now there is a demand that new history should be removed from Tipu as well as his father Hyder Ali, which is taught in the history books, which presents a different picture of Tipu
 karnataka hai court ne rajya ke mukhyamantri se poocha he ki jab 28 jayantiyon ko manaane main harj nahin he to tipu se parhez kyon? jab yediurppa ne bijepi chhodkar kejeepi kaa daaman thama tha to tipu ke maamle main unke tevar alag the
 He had aroused love for Tipu
 lekin bijepi main aate hi yediurppa badal gaye, tipu jayanti par hi roak laga di
 Now the organization that prepares the syllabus for the Karnataka board is deciding whether to teach or make changes to what is being taught about Tipu and Hyder Ali so far
 sangh parivaar kaa aarope he ki tipu ne logon kaa dharm parivartan karavaaya or kudagu jile main narsanhaar bhi kiya
 Historian Professor k Narasimayyah says that Tipu attacked Kudagu because the people there met the British seven times and rebelled against Tipu
 koi bhi raja apane kshetra kii baghawat bardaasht nahin kar saktaa isliye usne hamalaa kiya
 And other kings also did the same
 tipu sultan yahaan kai logon ke liye nayak hai to kai ke liye khalanaayak
 Among those for whom he is a hero, there are many who consider Tipu to be a vali
 jo unhen naapsand karte hai unke liye ve ravan se kam nahin hai

 West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the Sonbhadra massacre
 unhone (mamata Banerjee) kaha ki uttar pradesh sarkaar ne congress netaa priyanka gandhi wadra ko kanoon vyavastha kaa hawala dete hue sonbhadra jane kii anumati nahin di lekin bijepi party ke pratinidhimandal ne pashchim bengal ke bhatpaara kshetra kaa daura us samay kiya tha jab vahaan karfu laga hua tha
 Mamata Banerjee told reporters that i condemn Priyanka Gandhi's detention
 jo bhi hua vah galat tha
 There have been incidents of atrocities on Dalits in Sonbhadra and if anyone is raising voice against it, they should be allowed to do so
 unhone kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ne bhaajapa ke teen sadasyeey pratinidhimandal ko siarpisi kii dhara 144 lagu hone ke baavjood bhatpaara jane diya gaya tha, lekin party ne prashasan kii salaah par koi dhyaan nahin diya or kanoon kaa ulanghan karte hue 50 vaahanon ke saath vahaan gayi
 Priyanka took four people with her and i think three or four people should always be allowed
 hamane bhatpaara main aisa hi kiya tha
 We do not stop people but BJP do it and then spread lies about us
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki uttar pradesh kii kanoon vyavastha kii sthiti bahut kharaab bataate hue kaha ki mujhe bataaya gaya he ki 1,100 se adhik muthbhed (uttar pradesh main) hui hai or har roj peet petakar maar daalane kii ghatnaayen hoti hai
 These should be considered
 banerjee ne sonbhadra ghatana ke peediton ke paas deree se jane ke liye uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said that i heard that Adityanath is going to Sonbhadra (on Sunday)
 mujhe lagata he ki unhen jald hi janaa chahie tha
 What has happened in Sonbhadra is not correct
 gauratlab he ki uttar pradesh sarkaar priyanka gandhi ko sonbhadra jane kii ijaajat nahin di
 Against this attitude of the Uttar Pradesh government, when Priyanka Gandhi sat on a dharna, she was taken into custody
 iske baad vah kai ghanton tak mirzapur ke chunaar guest house main hi raheen
 And said that i will not leave here until i meet the victim's family
 priyanka kii is maang ke aage uttar pradesh sarkaar ko jhukna padaa or aakhirkaar sonbhadra narsanhaar ke peediton ke do rishtedaaron se vah chunaar guest house main hi milin
 After meeting 2 relatives of the victims of the Sonbhadra massacre at Chunar Guest House in Mirzapur, Priyanka Gandhi has said that her motive has been fulfilled
 unhone kaha ki vah abhi tak hiraasat main hai
 Now let's see what the administration says
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki congress kii ore se peedit parivaar ko 10 lakh rupee kii madad kii jaaegi jinke ghar ke log is hatyakand main maare gaye the
 At the same time, a statement has come from the DM of Mirzapur that Priyanka Gandhi is completely free, neither will she be detained or arrested or will have to fill any kind of bond
 duusari ore uttar pradesh ke dipti siem dinesh sharma ne kaha he ki dhara 144 lagane ke baad agar koi raajnneetik uddeshy ko puraa karne jaataa he to yah thik nahin he
 Nobody should do politics on sensitive issues
 duusari ore sonbhadra ja rahe chaar tiemasi saansadon ke alaav congress ke deepender hooda, mukul vaasanic, raaj babbar, jitin prasad, rajeev shukla ko varanasi airport main hiraasat liya gaya he
 Let us tell you that one side who had taken possession of the land in Sonbhadra attacked the other side, in which 10 people died
 iske baad se yogi sarkaar vipaksh ke nishane par aa gai thi
 Earlier, in the backdrop of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra being stopped by the administration, the Congress on Saturday accused the Yogi Adityanath government of the state of being a "jungle raj" and the "institutional killing" of tribals and questioned whether the government Why is she scared of Priyanka
 party ke mukhya pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ''sonbhadra kaa narsanhaar desh ke garib or kisaan ke khilaaf he
 These murders should be considered institutional
 '' unhone kaha, "peediton kii nyaay dene kii bajaay ajay singh urf adityanath kii sarkaar vipakshi dalon ke netaaon ke daman main lagi he
 Priyanka's fault is that she wanted to meet the victims and wipe their tears
 '' surajevaala ne kaha, " peedit adivaasiyon ke gaanv oombha ko police chhavnee bana diya gaya
 There is a ban on anyone coming
 kya vahaan aatankwaadi or ugravadi hai?'' unhone daawa kiya, "adityanath sarkaar ne 19 oktober 2017 ko adivaasiyon kii jameen ko mukhya aaropee ke naam kar di
 The Yogi government wants to occupy the land of the tribals
 adivasee kisaan ke khilaaf kai praathmiki darj kii gayi
 The tribals applied to the District Magistrate but no hearing was held
 '' unhone kaha, ''yah adityanath sarkaar kaa shadyantra nahin to kya he? sachai yah he ki adityanath sarkaar aparaadhiyo ko sangrakshan de rahi he
 She stands with the criminals at Sonbhadra
 '' unhone kaha ki ham narsanhaar ke peediton ko nyaay dilaane ke liye har sambhav kadam uthaaenge
 Surjewala also asked, "will the Adityanath government be able to suppress the truth by turning the entire Umbha village (sonbhadra) into a police camp? Why does the BJP government fear Priyanka Gandhi?" It is significant that Priyanka is going to Sonbhadra on Friday The administration stopped
 vah buudhvaar ko hue is samuhik hatyakand ke peedit pariwaron se milane ja raheen thi
 Priyanka sat on a dharna to protest the administration's move
 baad main unhen chunaar guest house le jaaya gaya
 On Saturday morning, some people from the victims' families reached there and met Priyanka

 Bangladesh's banned terrorist organization jamat-ul-mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) is becoming a major threat to India
 bangladesh se lagane vaale pashchim bengal ke simavarti jilon main usne majbootee se apni jaden jamaa lee hai
 JMBK terrorists are trying to flee to the states of india-bangladesh border for fear of security forces in the neighboring country
 yahi nahin khufia sutron ne ajtak ko jaankaree di he ki jamaat-ul-mujahidin bangladesh bhartiya upmahadweep ke kai deshon ke liye khatra banataa ja rahaa he

 Not only this, this terrorist organization is also involved in buying belts used in suicide attacks for JMB terrorists for the suicide attack
 bharat bangladesh border par nigaraanee rakhane vaali bhartiya suraksha agenciyaan bhi alert par hai
 Because whenever Bangladesh security agencies conduct operations against these dangerous terrorists, these terrorists try to infiltrate inside India and carry out major crime in the country

 The NIA succeeded in arresting about two dozen JMB militants from different parts of West Bengal and Assam, one after the other
 inke upar na sirf enie ne lakhon kaa inaam ghoshit kar rakhaa tha balki bangladesh main bhi wo most wanted kii list main the
 The NIA was also stunned by the facts found in the interrogation of those terrorists and the goods seized from their bases
 us samay aatankiyon ke thikaanon se rocket lanchar jaise khatarnaak hathiyaar bhi baraamad hue the
 Not only this, JMB terrorists used to make these weapons while sitting here and had made their deep penetration in some districts of the state
 saath hi bardhman, birbhum va murshidaabad jilon main kai aise madrason kaa pataa chalaa, jahaan ve log jihad ke liye yuvakon ko prashikshan dete va bhartee abhiyaan chalaate the
 During the interrogation, a conspiracy by these terrorists to overthrow the government in Bangladesh was also revealed
 saath hi bangladesh sahit pashchim bengal va assam ke kuch simavarti jilon ko milakar greater bangladesh banane ke mansoobey tak kaa pardaafash hua tha
 In June, the BSF gave a report to the Ministry of Home Affairs, jamaat-ul-mujahideen, the dreaded terrorist organization of Bangladesh, is trying to make the madrassas along the indo-bangladesh border into a jihad factory

 bihar bijepi ke varisht netaa or rajya ke purv upmukhyamantri susheel modi ne kaha he ki baba ramdev bijepi ke chavaniya sadsy bhi nahin hai
 Sushil Modi said at a press conference in Patna on Saturday that when Ramdev is not even a primary member of BJP, how can his words be put in bjp's account
 darasal, susheel modi se poocha gaya tha ki baba ramdev ne kaha tha ki centre main bijepi sarkaar banane ke baad 100 din main videshon main jamaa kaledhan ko waapas laayaa jayega
 This issue was recently raised by JDU leader Nitish Kumar in his Sampark Yatra in every district and everywhere he used to narrate Ramdev's statements and speeches made by Narendra Modi on black money
 susheel modi ne safai di ki narendra modi ke kehane kaa arth tha ki agar kaala dhan waapas aayega, to desh main har garib ke khate main 10 se 15 lakh rupee jamaa ho sakate hai
 In fact, the Bihar BJP is upset that Nitish Kumar, in his every meeting, narrates excerpts from speeches not only of Ramdev but also of Narendra Modi on the issue of black money

 All those with rickshaws, autos, cars, shops, pedestrians have put on some caps
 bijepi, aam aadmi party or samaajawaadee party kii tapiyaan zyada dikh rahi hai
 In that too, there is a competition among the people of AAP and BJP, to distribute more and more caps
 aam aadmi party ke kaaryakarta gali-mohallon, sadakon-chauraahon main logon ko roak-roak kar tapiyaan thama rahe hai
 On the other hand, Modi's caps, T-shirts, even saris are being sold in the market
 muft kii topi bhala kise nahin acchhee lagati
 So, whose hat was found, he beheaded
 topi pahane kai logon se maine poocha bhai sahab lagata he ki aap is party ke pakke samarthak hai
 Some were smiling and others gave some funny answers in a pinch
 jaise jisaki topi mil jaae, pahanane main kya harj he
 It is hard sun, there will be some protection
 ek bujurg se poocha to bade mjedaar dhang se bole, hamen pataa he ki netaa hamen topi pahana rahe hai
 Had fun
 ek rickshawvaale se maine poocha, kya aap aam aadmi party ko vot denge
 So he did not think yet
 maine kaha topi to aapane laga rakhi he
 He said yesterday i wore a BJP cap
 ghar se nange sir nikalataa hum
 i put on the hat which is distributed
 banaras kii galiyon, chauraahon or sadakon main puure din ghoomte-ghoomte na jane kitne logon se yah sawaal poocha
 The conclusion was that all these people wearing free caps are not supporters of any party or against any other party
 shaam ko dashashwamedh ghat main paan kii dukaan par paan lagaate hue vyakti ke sir par topi dekhakar mujhase rahaa nahin gaya, topi kii taraf ishaara karke kaha ki sahab lagata he abaki baar
 
 
 
 
 Government
 paan main chuunaa lagaate-lagaate us paan vaale ne kaha madam netaa to har baar janata ko topi pahanaate hai
 This time there are slightly more caps in the market

 Although there have been reports of disagreement between the two on several key issues in the past, Lalu says that the opposition BJP wants to damage his alliance with Nitish by distorting the facts

 Lalu Prasad took silence on this comment

 Lalu's supporters say that Lalu's opposition to 'saheb' is not politically appropriate due to Shahabuddin's influence in areas around Siwan
 ullekhneey he ki shahabuddin ko is ilaake main 'sahib' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Therefore, Lalu Prasad did not openly support the move when Nitish Kumar moved the Supreme Court in the case of Shahabuddin's bail

 On Monday night in Navi Mumbai, Swaraj Group owner and well-known builder Raj Kandhari committed suicide, in his suicide note, he has not held anyone responsible but has tried to make a picture of the difficulties through words
 police kaa kahana he ki builder karodon ke karj ke dabaav main tha
 The copy of Raj Kandhari's suicide note is with NDTV, in which he has written on the first and second page, 'no one can ruin us, we can do our damage but we cannot ruin'

 Kandhari's company built several houses in areas such as Goa, Navi Mumbai, Digha, Govandi, Airoli, Ghansoli, Chembur
 lekin panwel main faile 40 acre ke swaraj laguna main unka bahut paisa lag gaya
 Sources reveal that the files of many projects are stuck, in such a situation, the police is clearly not saying anything on the corrupt alliance of leader-builder-babus but is not even denying it
 navi mumbai ke disipi shahji umap ne kaha, "in projects main unka bahut sara paisa laga tha, ham jaanch kar rahe hai ki jin logon ne isamen paisa lagaaya tha unase inke rishte kaise the, ham ye bhi jaanch rahe hai ki kahin unhen koi dhamkee bharaa phone to nahin aayaa tha
 " kuch maheenon pehle thane ke bade builder suraj parmaar ne khudakushi kar lee thi, unke suicide note main netaa-baabuon ke gathjod kaa zikr tha
 Police had also arrested some councilors to resolve this nexus
 iske baad mohan group ke amar bhaatia kaa shav bhi railway trek par mila tha
 The investigation into the Raj Kandhari suicide case is currently under the responsibility of the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch, but it is so clear that if the administration does not act vigorously and does not end this alliance, it will be difficult to rein in such cases
 raaj kandhari ke suicide note kii copy enditivi ke paas he, jisamen pehle or duusare panne par usne likhaa he, 'hamen koi barbaad nahin kar saktaa, hamaara nuksaan kar saktaa he par, barbaad nahin kar saktaa

 On many TV channels, the claims of election use of these fake fingers are being pointed at and they are being told a viral lie
 lekin 'aaj tak' kii special invastigeshan team ne in nakli ungaliyon ke saudagaron ko dhund nikaala he, jo uttar pradesh ke chunaavon main in nakli ungaliyon ke asli saplir hai
 The sting operation of 'aaj Tak' proved that the use of fake finger in voting is not a viral lie but a certified truth
 darasal voting ke dauraan ungaliyon par lagaaya gaya nishaan loktantr main janata kii takat kaa pratik he
 These ink marks on the voters' fingers prevent voting more than once
 lekin ab loktantr ko thenga dikhaane waalon ne iskaa bhi tod nikaal liya he or wo tod he ye nakli ungliyaan
 Suppliers of fake fingers recorded in Aaj Tak intelligence cameras have claimed the demand for fake fingers by political parties for fake voting
 andercover invastigeshan team ne sting oparation ke dauraan aisi hi ek nakli ungali kharidi he
 The supplier of 'fake fingers' in the election, Benakabshambhu Kumar Yadav, who is a consultant of Born Life Company in New Delhi
 artificial yani kritrim maanav angon ke bijness main inaki company kaa bada naam he
 Reporter: Well, which party bought the most, would you know? Shambhu Kumar Yadav:
 
 
 ne kharida he sabase zyada sidhi si baat bataaun to aapse jhooth kya boluungaa, ye bhi 
 
 
 
 ko hi jayega
 Reporter: Okay
 shanbhu kumaar yadav: thik he, ye bhi aapako pehle hi bataa rahaa hum, ye bhi 
 
 
 
 ko jayega
 (the thing that is being talked about here is nothing but fake fingers made of silicone and the biggest buyer of these fake fingers is taking the name of Shambhu Yadav
 wo uttar pradesh kii badi raajnneetik party he)shanbhu kumaar yadav: coast jo hoga lagbhag agar 3 hazaar kaa pis kaa order karte hai to lagbhag 2800 rupee se lekar 36 sau ke bich main aayega
 Reporter: One's? Shambhu Kumar Yadav: One's, if it will be 10 thousand quantity if product production will be done
 reporter: chalo bhai wo dikhaa do kya naam he bhai ek baar
 Shambhu Kumar Yadav: Rs 1800? Reporter: Rs 1800
 shanbhu kumaar yadav: ek lakh agar quantity order kar dete hai iskaa to 1100 rupee kaa
 Shambhu Kumar Yadav: The real thing is that 500 finger still came from Lucknow
 reporter: wo to main mana
 (shambhu Yadav assured that the deal would be confirmed that such duplications would be made with finger that the election officer would not have any chance of being suspicious) Shambhu Kumar Yadav: Will it be okay or not
 reporter: bilkul thik rahegaa
 Reporter: You will get till 26 or not till 26
 shanbhu kumaar yadav: mil jayegareporter: 26 to 27 ko ellection hai naa
 Reporter: Election
 shanbhu kumaar yadav: thik he kitni quantity chahie?(abtak shanbhu yadav ko yakeen aa chukaa tha ki ham vaaki nakli ungaliyon kii deal main interestid he
 So he not only showed us the demo of fake finger, but also told how fake voting can be done)
 reporter: nikaaliega isko
 Shambhu Kumar Yadav: It will not come out so soon
 reporter: haa, to bas to sahi he phir or kya chahie
 Shambhu Kumar Yadav: It will not come out so soon and even this is what you are applying
 shanbhu kumaar yadav: isaki jarurat nahin he ek anguthi aati hai jaise kaan main aise chipkaane vaala hota hai naa kunda aise anguthi aati isko dabaa dijie
 Reporter: You will not recognize the finger at all, will it? Shambhu Kumar Yadav: i will not
 reporter: open karne main daalane main koi dikkat to nahin?shanbhu kumaar yadav: nahin aegi
 Reporter: him in a fake vote
 shanbhu kumaar yadav: aapako to dikhaa to diya

 reporter: maximum 500 pehle, pichhali party ne kitna kiya order?shanbhu kumaar yadav: pichhali party ne kiya he 300 kaa?reporter: 300
 
 
 Political party? Shambhu Yadav claimed that many political parties buy fake fingers during election season
 shanbhu yadav ne khufia camere par un raajnneetik dalon ke naam bhi bataae jinhone uski company se thok main nakli ungliyaan kharidin
 If Shambhu Yadav's claims are to be believed, then the contribution of fake fingers in fake voting is not a fantasy, but 100% true
 'aaj tak' ke is bade khulaase main farji matdaan ke liye nakli ungaliyon ke istemaal kaa kaala sach saamne aa chukaa he or ye sabit ho chukaa he ki nakli ungali se voting kalpana nahin, balki hakeekat he
 In the voting, how is this fraudulent practice of getting a person to vote multiple times through fake finger
 isaki gaharaai se chaanbin karne ke dauraan 'aaj tak' ke andercover repotars kii team nakli ungaliyon kii supplai karne vaali dilli kii ek or company ke do adhikariyon se mili, jinhone matdaan main raajnneetik phaayde ke liye nakli ungaliyon ke istemaal ko beparda kar diya
 While investigating the truth of the use of fake fingers in fake voting, i met another supplier of fake fingers

 Due to the UP elections, there is a huge demand for fake fingerprint orders in his company

 Ajendra Kumar: Importing is better

 In Madhya Pradesh, Congress has been facing the exile of power for 15 years
 ab bhagwaan ram ke 14 saal ke vanvaas kii raah par congress chalakar siyaasi jang fatah karnaa chaahati he
 This is the reason why Congress has now made a plan to start 'ram Van Gaman Path Yatra'
 kamalnath ke pradesh adhyaksh banane ke baad se congress rajya main soft hindutv kii niti ko apana rahi he
 This is the reason that Congress these days has started talking about cow, Narmada, temple and now Ram in the state
 isi kaa nateeja he ki congress 'ram van gaman path yatra' shuru karne ja rahi he
 This journey of Congress Congress will start from September 21 and continue till October 9, depending on Ram
 congress kii yah yatra kareeb 35 vidhansabha kshetron se hokar gujaregi

 He had said that BJP talks a lot about cow, but the condition of gaushalas in the state is very bad
 unhone kaha ki pradesh main saikadon gaay roj mar rahi hai
 The BJP only does politics in the name of the cow, but the Congress cannot see the cow suffering
 isliye sadakon par aawaara gum rahi gaayon ko panchayat str par goshaala khol kar usamen bheja jayega taaki vah durghatana kaa shikaar naa ho saken
