 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has once again cut the repo rate in order to increase the demand in a sluggish economy
 guuruuvaar ko apni maudrik niti samiksha main rigerv bank ne repo rate main chauthai fisadi kii katautee kar use 5
 75 percent tax
 isse logon ko lone main iemai ghatane ko lekar ummid bad gai he
 But if we look at the trends of previous years, then there is no reason to be happy in this matter
 rigerv bank to byaaj daron main katautee par katautee kiye ja rahaa he, lekin bank uskaa puraa phayda graahakon tak nahin pahunchaa rahe
 In the last five years, banks have been stifling the domestic economy in a way by not reaching the benefit of the reduction in the repo rate to the customers
 lagaataar oonchi byaaj dar hone kii vajah se udyog jagat bhi nae project yaa puraane plant ke vistaar se hichakataa rahaa he
 According to CMIE, private investment in the country has reached a 14-year low
 oonchi byaaj dar kaa sidhaa asar automobile, kanjumar durable or emmemjisi utpaadon kii khapat par bhi pad rahaa he
 Because of this, the engine of consumption in the country has come to a standstill
 janvari, 2014 main rigerv bank ne byaaj daron main badhat ke silsile ko palatate hue repo rate main katautee kii thi
 Since then, the Reserve Bank has cut the repo rate 10 times and has a total of 2
 25 fisadi tak kami aa chuki he
 Repo rate reduced from 8 percent in 2014 to 5 now
 75 fisadi tak aa chukaa he
 On the other hand, the country's largest bank, State Bank of India, meanwhile, reduced its loan interest rate to just 0
 6 fisadi kii katautee kii he or yah 10
 9 from 15 per cent
 55 fisadi tak pahunchaa he
 This kind of disobedience is unprecedented
 lekin vitt mantralay or rigerv bank kii is par maun sahmati hi dikh rahi he
 Banks argue that they have to adjust high interest rate deposit schemes before the benefit of the repo rate reduction is passed on to the customers and the industry
 lekin unhen apane lone portpholio ko samyojit karne ke liye 5 saal mil chuke hai
 There is no excuse for this now
 gauratlab he ki guuruuvaar ko arabiai kii maudrik niti samiksha baithak main repo rate main 0

 iske alaava rigerv bank ne enift jaise mani transfar suvidha main apni taraf se lagane vaale charge main katautee kar bhi badi raahat di he
 The Reserve Bank has also decided to review the fees charged on ATM withdrawals

 India has suffered a major setback in the VVIP chopper agustawestlandghotale case
 italy kii milan court main agasta westland or finamkanika ke purv chif gisepi oresi, bichauliye krishchan mishael, agasta westland ke purv sheersh adhikariyon giusepe oresi or bruno speganolini samet sabhi aropiyon ko bari kar diya gaya he
 In the case, former Finmacnica chief Gisepi Orsi was accused of bribing in the deal
 italy kii samachar agency ANSA ke mutabik maamle main adaalat ne kaha ki is baat ke koi saboot nahin hai, jinase yah sabit ho sake ki 3600 karod rupee ke viviipi helicopter deal main bhrashtachar hua tha
 The Italian court has also dropped the charge of causing harm to India
 maaloom ho ki bharat ne is deal main nuksaan hone kii baat kahi thi
 The Milan court's decision on the agustawestland case may weaken the cbi's case in India
 sibiai is deal ke silsile main purv vayusena pramukh espi tyaagi samet kai aropiyon ke khilaaf jaanch kar rahi he
 CBI had joined Milan court as a civil party, while CBI told India Today that India had joined Milan court as a civil party
 is faisle kaa bharat main chal rahi, uski jaanch par koi asar nahin padegaa
 The CBI claims that it has sufficient evidence in this case
 maamle main ek bichauliye krishchan mishael ne india today se baatcheet main kaha, ''main shuru se kah rahaa tha ki is maamle main koi raajnneetik bhrashtachar nahin hua tha
 Now the Government of India should clarify the situation in this matter
 ''somvaar ko aae italy kii adaalat ke faisle main is cese main aaropee rahe mishael or hashke samet teenon bichauliyon ko bhi bari kar diya gaya he
 However both of these accused are wanted in India
 italy kii adaalat ke faisle kaa bharat main chal rahe cese par asarmaana ja rahaa he ki isi cese ke ek aaropee or bharat kii vayusena ke purv pramukh espi tyaagi milan court ke is faisle kaa istemaal apane haq main kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, the Congress may also attack the ruling BJP at the Center in the coming days
 2ji cese ke faisle ke baad viviipi helicopter ghotaale main bhi court ne paryaapt saboot na hone kaa hawala diya he
 Both these 'scams' took place during the UPA regime itself
 maamle kii apil kaa vikalp khulaab is cese main itavali abhiyojkon ke paas phir se apil karne kaa adhikaar he, lekin abhi italy ke adhikariyon kii ore se is maamle main kuch nahin kaha gaya he
 In this deal worth $ 672 million, the Government of India bought 12 VVIP helicopters, with former finmacnica chief Giuseppe Orsi accused of bribing the deal
 agasta westland ke purv pramukh bruno speganolini ko bhi is cese main bari kar diya gaya he
 Earlier in December 2016, the Supreme Court of Cassation ordered a re-hearing
 puraane faisle main oresi ko saadhe chaar saal or bruno ko chaar saal kii sajaa sunai gai thi
 He was sentenced on international level for corruption and forgery
 kya tha maamlasaal 2010 main 3600 karod rupee main 12 viviipi agasta westland helicopter kharidne kaa sauda hua tha
 It is alleged that agustawestland bribed Indian officials to the tune of Rs 423 crore to get the deal
 italy kii nichali adaalat ne maamle main saal 2016 main aropiyon ko doshi tehraaya tha
 Orsi was sentenced to four and a half years in the case and Bruno to four years
 iske baad isse pehle italy kii supreme court ne maamle main sabhi aropiyon ke khilaaf dobaaraa se sunwaayee karne kaa aadesh diya tha
 Now the Milan court of Italy has acquitted all the accused in the case

 '' In the Gujarat Assembly elections, all the Union ministers from the BJP are camping in the state, while Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has made several visits to Gujarat with his team, but the truth is that the elections are just in front of the public on the rally grounds and roads
 But it is not being fought, but the full-fledged strategy and social media are also seeing its full impact
 rahul gandhi roj koi na koi twit kar centre main sattadhari bijepi or piem narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hai
 In the same episode, on Sunday, Rahul, while criticizing the Make in India project of the Modi government, wrote that the project has died down, for which he also made reference to a newspaper news
 rahul ke bijepi par nishane ke baad sattadhari party ke log bhi soshal media par active rahul or congress party ko gherne main lag gaye
 BJP IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya released a video of Rahul's public meeting, alleging the presence of very few people in it
 iske baad unhone ek twit main likhaa, 'gujarat main ek baad ekaphlop hoti reliyonke baad rahul gandhi ke alaava sabhi congressi netaa chunaav prachaar chhod chuke hai, yah rajtilak ke liye taiyaar nae adhyaksh ke liye acchhee baat he'
 Malviya also targeted Rahul and the Congress party fiercely through several other tweets
 Looks like all Congress leaders in Gujarat have withdrawn from the campaign leaving Rahul Gandhi to do one flop rally after another

 Replying to Malaviya, he wrote, 'brother, the presence of our vice president does not bother the BJP, so why 40 ministers and 6 chief ministers have been campaigning in the state
 yahi rahul kii lokapriyata ko dikhaata he
 Why are you resorting to lies everyday? priyanka ne bhi aatanki hafiz said kii rihaai par piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Bhaiya @ malviyamitif presence of our VP in Gujarat has rattled the BJP so much so that they have sent 40 ministers & 6cms to the state to campaign it is a good enough indicator of rg's popularity
 Kyun roz jhooth ka sahara le rahe ho?— Priyanka Chaturvedi (@priyankac19)november 26, 2017saaf he ki bijepi or congress jameen ke alaava soshal media par bhi ek-duusare ko gherne kaa koi mauka nahin chhodana chaahati hai

 Madhya Pradesh's infamous Vocational Examination Board (vyapam) scandal created a stir across the country after a spate of sudden deaths in June and July this year
 iske baad july main supreme court ne maamle kii jaanch sibiai ke hawaale kar di
 But since taking over the investigation, the CBI has not been able to make any arrests till now
 sibiai ne 1,000 se zyada unheen logon ke khilaaf alag-alag maamalon main exiar darj kii he, jin par madhya pradesh estf pehle hi exiar darj kar chuki thi
 On the other hand, completely removed from Vyapam, there are signs of interference in the case of Madhya Pradesh Police
 sarkaar kii taraf se khud ko paak-saaf bataane ke liye kiye gaye prayaason kii kalai bhi khulne lagi he
 If we look at the action of CBI so far, 170 officials of Supreme Investigation Agency are camping in Bhopal
 maamle kii vyapaktaa ko dekhte hue jaanch ke liye “special branch for vyapam scam” banane kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Two bungalows in the Professors Colony have been made temporary offices of the investigation team
 lekin jaanch ke saath sibiai adhikariyon ko rihaaish ke liye bhi sangharsh karnaa pad rahaa he
 Most of the officers are currently staying in guest houses or circuit houses
 jahaan tak jaanch kaa sawaal he to madhya pradesh estf ab tak saare maamle sibiai ko saunp chuki he or estf kii bhoomika is maamle main ab samaapt ho gai he
 STF has transferred more than 150 cases to CBI
 kehane ko sibiai ne do baar desh bhar main chaape bhi maare lekin koi thos jaankaree ab tak baahar nahin ai he
 That is why Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh's lawyer Kapil Sibal raised the matter in the Supreme Court in October, saying that so far no arrests have been made and nothing appears to be happening on the ground
 lekin haule-haule chalati sibiai jaanch ke bich madhya pradesh police par phir se sattadhari bijepi or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke logon ko bachaane kaa aarope lagane laga he
 In the latest case, the Gwalior police called Whistle Blower Ashish Kumar Chaturvedi for questioning about the relationship with the RSS without any complaint
 chaturvedi na sirf maamle ke visal blower or pramukh gavaah hai, balki supreme court main vyapam ghotaale ke khilaaf yachika daalane waalon main bhi shaamil hai
 On 8 December, Chaturvedi received a letter in which Gwalior Additional Superintendent of Police Virender Jain asked him to come to the office and record his statement
 patr main kaha gaya tha ki chaturvedi ne aresas ke bare main kuch bayaan die hai, jo ek akhbaar main chape hai
 Come and tell Chaturvedi police what is the matter about RSS? Significantly, after the Vyapam scam made headlines in 2013, the names of many top leaders of the RSS had also cropped up
 ghotaale ke silsile main jail main band madhya pradesh ke purv ucch shiksha mantri lakshmikant sharma or maamle ke mukhya aaropee sudhir sharma bhi aresas ke kareebi rahe hai
 By the way, in 2013 to clarify his stand, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had rejected the suggestion that any RSS leader's name be associated with the scam
 taaja maamle main hua yah ki is saal 23 aktubar ko ek swayamsevak ke naate chaturvedi aresas ke vijaydashami kaarykram ke pathsanchalan main khaaki nekar, safed shart or lambii lathi lekar kadamtal karne lage
 This created an uncomfortable situation for the RSS
 chaturvedi kaa daawa he ki is ghatana ke baad aresas ke logon ne unase sangh kii gatividhiyon se dur rahane kii hidaayat di
 The police got involved in the investigation after Chaturvedi made this statement in the media
 police kaa paksh rakhte hue gwalior ke eespi virendra jain ne india today ko bataaya, “akhabaaron main prakashit hone vaali khabaron kii kataranen variyata ke hisaab se sambandhit adhikariyon ko police mukhyalay se bheji jaati hai
 This is a routine process
 sangh ke bare main chaturvedi ke bayaan ke samachar kii kataran bhi mere karyaalay ko praapt hui thi
 He was called to know his side in this
 ”lekin chaturvedi kaa kahana he ki police aresas netaaon ko bachaane ke liye yah maamla sibiai ko nahin saunp rahi he
 i have demanded the police not to interfere in the case and to investigate the role of the RSS with the CBI
 “vyapam kaa sach’ main kai jhoothchaturvedi kii hi tarah indore ke dow anand raay bhi vyapam ghotaale ke visal blower hone ke saath hi sangh ke swayamsevak hai
 a doctor by profession is the vice president of the Indore department of Arogya Bharati, an association associated with the association
 haalanki, ghotaale kaa khulaasa karne ke baad unhen bhi sangh ke kisi kaarykram main nahin bulaayaa ja rahaa
 Rai had earlier accused Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan of putting pressure on himself
 iske alaava unki patni gauri raay ke tabadale ko bhi unhone dabaav banane kaa hatkandaa bataaya tha
 Later on the orders of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, the husband and wife were posted in one place
 yahi nahin sibiai jaanch shuru hone ke baad madhya pradesh bijepi ne “vyapam kaa sach” naam se ek bocolate bantwai
 But officially neither the BJP nor the Madhya Pradesh government became its publisher
 is pustika main vyapam ke visal blowers par gambhir aarope lagaae gaye
 Dr
 Anand Rai was also mentioned in this as having many criminal cases
 inamen se ek maamla indore ke thana palasia main 211 / 2007, dhara 323, dhara 504 kaa bhi zikr he
 But when Rai got the details of this from RTI, it was found that the case is of another person named Anand Rai's son Surya Prakash Rai
 raay anya aaropon ke bare main bhi sakshya jutaney main lage hai
 Opinions on such activities say that even after handing the case over to the CBI, the people of Madhya Pradesh government are not deterred by adopting other tactics to create pressure
 haa, fark itnaa he ki pehle sidhaa dabaav hota tha, jabaki ab isaki pravriti paroksh ho gai he
 Making strict remarks on the entire development, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh says, “chaturvedi and Rai are Sangh activists
 donon ne jab vyapam ghotaalaa uthaane main sangh se sahyog maanga to inhen chup kara diya gaya
 After that i started helping them
 ” singh kaa maananaa he ki chaturvedi se poochtacha kar madhya pradesh police ne jaanch main dakhal diya he or is bare main ve kanoonee karrwai karenge
 On the other hand, the slow pace of investigation is going on even after CBI reaches the case, it will also act as a political fuel in the coming days
 sibiai ke kaam karne kii baangi is baat se samajhi ja sakati he ki vyapam ke aaropee bijepi netaa gulab singh kiraar par inaam ghoshit tha, lekin sibiai ne unhen giraftaar karne main itnaa vakt lagaaya ki ve pehle hi agrim jamaanat hasil karne main safal ho gaye
 However, the party has currently suspended him
 jail main band logon se bhi sibiai kuch nayaa nahin nikalava pai he
 From this, the flame of justice is seen to be dim
 sibiai sutron kii maane to ghotaale kii jaanch main kareeb paanch saal lag sakate hai
 On the other hand, since the commencement of the investigation, two leading CBI officers have applied to withdraw from the investigation
 agar sibiai jald kuch bade khulaase nahin karti he or police “routine” kaam karti rahati he to sawaal to uthenge hi
 The press release issued by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 'fake News' may have come back after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's order but there are still concerns
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki mantralay digital, online news content par fail rahi phek news par roak lagane kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 Work has been going on for this for a month

 a committee was also formed by the Ministry, which was working on a policy for digital broadcasting and news portals
 abhi is cameti kii kuch baithken ho chuki hai or jald hi is bare main draft bhi jari kiya ja saktaa he
 The committee comprises members of I&B, Law, Telecom, Ministry of Industry along with members of the Press Council of India, NBA, IBF
 cameti kii baithak main jo mudda nikalakar saamne aayaa vah yah tha ki abhi tak online content ke liye koi regulation nahin he
 And the regulations that have been made regarding tv-print media cannot be applied for online
 iske tahat fasebuk, utyub, instagram, twitor bhi iske antargat hi aate hai
 First of all there will be some regulations related to them, after which the code of conduct linked to the online news portal can be brought
 saaf he ki jis tarah se online media par logon kii nirbharta badi he, usko dekhte hue mantralay kii koshish he ki digital plateform par galat jaankaree naa faile
 Let me tell you that recently the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued a press release related to Fake News
 jise piemo ke aadesh ke baad waapas le liya gaya tha
 Apart from this, the Prime Minister had directed that the Press Council of India will hear such cases
 aapako bataa den ki somvaar ko soochna evam prasaaran mantralay ne patrakaron kii manyata kii sanshodhit guideline jari kii thi
 It included many new provisions to deal with 'fake news'

 Janata Dal (united) has set the agenda for the assembly elections to be held in Bihar in the year 2020 as soon as the Lok Sabha elections are over
 party is baar bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang jor-shor se uthaaegi
 However, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been following this issue since 2009
 2009 ke chunaav main unhone yahaan tak kaha tha ki jo bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja degaa, use samarthan denge
 However, at that time the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was successful in getting support
 jediu ne 2010 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhi vishesh rajya ke mudde ko uthaaya tha
 The demand for grant of special state status to Bihar was also made a major issue in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 2014 main jadyu akele chunaav ladi thi lekin is mudde kaa vishesh phayda nahin mil paaya tha
 Later, when Modi's government was formed at the Center, the provision of giving a special state to the Planning Commission by making the NITI Aayog was scrapped
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi or pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii jagah sava lakh karod kaa package dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 However, part of the package was available for different schemes
 lekin tab nitish kumaar ke netritv main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar thi or samay samay par bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dene kii maang uthati rahi thi
 Many times the reply came from the center that there is no provision for it now
 july 2017 bhartiya janaat party main jab nitish kumaar apane puraane sahyogi bhartiya janata party ke saath milakar bihar main phir se endie kii sarkaar banaai
 Ever since the formation of the new government, the demand of granting special state status to Bihar became weak from the government
 vipaksh main khadi rashtriya janata dal(argedy) ne is mudde ko jor shor se uthaanaa shuru kar diya
 The Mahagathbandhan had raised this issue even in the 2019 elections, but the JDU had started raising the issue in the last phase of this Lok Sabha election
 iske peeche kii vajah he andhra pradesh or odisha dwaara vishesh rajya kaa darja kii maang karnaa
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said that granting special state status to Bihar is now included in the government's prominence
 party ke pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh bhi kehete hai ki bihar ko vishesh rajya ke darje ke mudde par sarvadaleey sahmati he
 JDU has been fighting this battle from the beginning
 iske paksh main hamane sava karod logon ke hastakshar raashtrapati ko bheje hai
 It is our duty to revive demand strongly
 adhyaksh ne kaha ki bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane kaa mudda chunavi mudda banegaa
 The people of Bihar have already been influenced and supported by this issue

 Thatcher worked to protect the Conservative stream of politics from the imperial tendencies whose bourgeoisie did not want to get out of its comfort zone of status quoism
 unhone is ''karunamayi” dhara main ek nayaa visheshan joda: aakraamakata
 He applied his politics across the border of Britain
 aayran ladi kahi jane vaali is shakhsiyat ne tamaam fauladi avarodhon ko todgaye ke liye sangharsh kiya

 Lady Thatcher's aggressive protectionism in power shattered all assurances of an ideology that was accustomed to celebrating the traditional things in society and whose supreme mentor was Benjamin Dijaraeli

 purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli ko lagata he ki virendra sahvaag kii safalataa kii bhukh or rahul dravid ke footwork ke pravaah main giravat aayi he
 The way Sehwag and Dravid got out in the ongoing fourth Test match against Australia, it seems that Ganguly is shocked
 ganguli ne sidney marning herold main apane kalam main likhaa he, ‘sahvaag phir se dhilaa shaat khelkar out hue
 In the last few years, his commitment to foreign tours has declined a lot
 unhone kaha, ‘vah kabhi aisa khilaadi nahin rahaa jiskaa footwork bahut acha rahaa ho lekin vah aapni anya visheshtaon se isaki bharpaayi karata he jaise ki safal hone kii bahut zyada bhukh
 Right now it seems as if it has declined
 ganguli ne kaha, ‘jahaan tak dravid kaa sawaal he to gend lagaataar unke stump ukhaad rahi he
 i do not remember that he was bowled so many times in his career before and it is becoming a concern for him and many people related to this game are also worried about it
 ’unhone kaha, ‘aisa lagata he ki vah apni taraf aane vaali gendon se hairaan ho jate hai or balle kaa aglaa hissaa turn ho jaataa he jisase gend ko aage nikalne kaa rasta mil jaataa he
 The flow seen in their footwork is completely missing and they will have to work hard to regain it
 ’ganguli ne yah tippanee tab kii jabaki bharat ne austrailia ke saat wicket par 604 ran ke jawaab main sahvaag or dravid ke wicket jaldi ganvaa diye
 Cricketer-turned-commentator Ganguly feels that India will have to fight hard to avoid whitewash
 unhone kaha, ‘bharat ne din ke aakhir main do wicket par 61 ran banaaye he or uske liye austrailian score ke kareeb pahunchnaa bahut mushkil bharaa hoga
 India still has a long way to go
 austrailian score ke kareeb pahunchane ke liye do shatakon kii jarurat padegi
 Ganguly also wished Sachin Tendulkar to score the 100th international century in the city of the legendary Sir Don Bradman
 unhone kaha, ‘main nahin jaanata ki un par 100wein shatak kaa dabaav he lekin yadi mahashatak sar donald breadman ke rajya main banataa he to bahut acha hoga

 Citizens who have knocked in the High Court to protest against this proposed bridge say that they have objections not only to its cost but also to the lack of planning

 raghuvar das kii jindagi kaa safar asaadhaaran rahaa he
 Today, he is sitting on the chair of the Chief Minister of Jharkhand, leaping from a modest background of a laborer on leave in Tata Steel
 jab safar itnaa shandaar ho to usamen kismat kaa bhi kuch na kuch haath rahaa hi hoga
 However, in the case of Das, the misfortune of others has been equally shared
 yah sukhad vidambnaa hi he ki das kii kariyar kii tamaam safaltaaon main kisi duusare kii naakamayaabi bhi shaamil rahi he
 Raghuvar contested his first assembly election in 1995 because the BJP had refused to give the ticket to Dinanath Pandey, the MLA from Jamshedpur East seat
 yah pandeya hi the jinke liye raghuvar ne 1990 main chunaav prachaar kiya tha
 Angered by the ticket being cut, Pandey raised the rebellion flag and contested the independent election and came third
 jabaki bijepi ummidavaar kii haisiyat se raghuvar 1,101 voton ke maamuli antar se vidhayak chune gaye
 Years later, the same thing happened in December 2014
 59 varshiya raghuvar das bijepi vidhayak dal ke chunautiviheen netaa ke taur par isliye ubhar sake kyonki teen baar mukhyamantri rah chuke bijepi netaa arjuna munda kharasaavaan se haroonges tareeke se chunaav haar gaye
 If Munda did not lose, Raghuvar's path would not have been as easy
 28 disambar ko shapath lene ke saath hi raghuvar jharkhand ke pehle gaiyr adivasee mukhyamantri ho gaye
 Whereas before, the five men who have held the Chief Minister's chair nine times - Babulal Marandi, Shibu Soren, Arjun Munda, Madhu Koda and Hemant Soren - have been from the tribal community
 lekin munda ke haar jane ke baad bijepi ke paas koi kaddavar adivasee tha hi nahin
 By the way, before 2014, Raghuvar always remained in the background
 bijepi main pehle marandi kii or phir hameshaa munda kii hi chalati thi
 When all eyes were on Munda, Raghuvar used to wait patiently in the background
 aisa hi ek mauka disambar 2009 main vidhansabha chunaav ke baad aayaa, jab raghuvar ko pehali badi kamyaabi mili or ve bijepi vidhayak dal ke netaa chune gaye
 However, he had to pay the price for having such a big dream, when the opponents pushed him into political bias for four and a half years
 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi or jeemem donon ko 18-18 siten milin
 The BJP eventually agreed to support the Shibu Soren-led coalition
 raghuvar ko bijepi vidhayak dal kaa netaa banaaya gaya or unhone up mukhyamantri ke taur par shapath lee
 Although Raghuvar made a good impression with his style of work, he could not stay in this post for more than five months
 may 2010 main bijepi ne jeemem ke netritv vaali gathbandhan sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya, kyonki shibu sorain ne, jinhone sansad kii sadsyta abhi chodi nahin thi, loksabhaa main ‘‘bhulvash’’ bajet main petrol kii keemton par badhotaree ke khilaaf bijepi kii ore se laae gaye katautee prastaav ke khilaaf vot diya tha
 But within three months, bjp's then party president Nitin Gadkari overturned the policy of not having any connection with JMM at the behest of Arjun Munda
 lihaaja sitambar 2010 main jeemem ke samarthan se ek or gathbandhan sarkaar ne satta sanbhali or is baar uski aguai munda kar rahe the
 Then BJP Legislature Party leader Raghuvar Das had to step down in favor of Munda
 itnaa hi nahin, mahaj teen maheene pehle tak rajya ke up mukhyamantri rahe das ko nai sarkaar main mantri tak nahin banaaya gaya
 Not that Raghubar, meanwhile, did not try to stake his claim for leadership or show rebellious tone, but none of his efforts could bring more color than hitting the wall
 aktubar 2010 main jab munda ne apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar kiya to raghuvar samaaroh main shaamil nahin hue
 He even left the post of state BJP chief to express his displeasure
 lekin kendriya netritv ne unka istipha kabool kar munda ke vishwaasapaatr dineshanand goswami ko rajya party kaa pramukh bana diya
 Similarly, in October 2011, when top BJP leader LK Advani came to Ranchi with his public awareness rally, Das had been in the party for more than a year
 raghuvar ne sochaa yahi makul mauka he
 He presented a copy of a local newspaper to Advani, which had a report on the front page revealing the waste of coal and oil in the state government's power plants
 bijli mahakama tab mukhyamantri munda ke paas hi tha or saaf jaahir tha ki das ke nishane par koun he
 But this bet also backfired
 phir raghuvar may 2010 se saadhe chaar saal tak rajnatik vanvaas main rahe
 In the first 14 years of its existence, in a state that has seen nine governments, such a long period can be considered equal to the ages
 is daur main sanghathan ke morche par bhi kisi ne unki sud nahin lee
 Das, who was BJP state president in 2004-05 and 2009-10, has also struggled to maintain his political existence
 virodhiyon ko shant karne or rajnatik kariyar bachaane kii aas main raghuvar sab kuch jhelte rahe
 He did not leave his land and remained in the organization
 aakhirkaar un par tab dhyaan diya gaya, jab loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne jharkhand kii 14 main se 12 siten jeet leen
 Things started getting better in August itself
 tabhi raghuvar ko padonnat karke amit shah kii team main party kaa rashtriya upaadhyaksh bana diya gaya
 With this, he came in the top of the contenders for the Chief Minister's chair
 vidhansabha chunaav najadik aane ke saath hi dilli main kai logon ko lagane laga ki rajya main bijepi ko ek nae chehre kii jarurat he or thik isi mukaam par raghuvar majboot hokar ubharne lage
 Das left no stone unturned to strengthen the party's organizational base in preparation for the assembly elections
 lagaataar paanch baar vidhayak chune gaye raghuvar ne kabhi koi chunaav nahin haara
 His electoral record also places him above many others
 das ko shaayad apni ugrata par kaabo rakhkar sabhi ke saath sanyat vyavhaar karne se sabase zyada madad mili
 He had earlier expressed his displeasure and opposition, but never crossed his political boundaries
 munda ne jharkhand kii raajnneeti main unhen darkinar karne main koi kasar nahin chodi, lekin das ne saarvajanik rup se unke khilaaf kabhi ek lafj nahin bolaa
 When Munda lost the election this December, he still went to his house drinking tea
 lekin shishtachar nibhaane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki raghuvar apni raajnneeti nahin jaanate
 Taking oath as the 10th Chief Minister of Jharkhand on 28 December, he also administered the oath to Nilkanth Munda among the three cabinet ministers
 aktubar, 2010 main arjuna munda ne apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar karte hue bijepi ke do hi netaaon ko nazarandaaj kiya tha
 Apart from Raghuvar Das, he was the second leader Neelkanth
 haalanki das spasht bahumat ke saath satta sanbhaalane vaale pehle mukhyamantri hai, lekin unhone is tarah kaamkaaj shuru kiya maano ve fatafat sara kaam nipta dena chaahate hai
 Shortly after taking oath, he picked up the broom and reached a slum colony in Ranchi to contribute to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cleanliness drive
 kaarykaal ke pehle hi din unhone chaabuk fatkaarna shuru kar diya
 He immediately sought to streamline law and order and personally supervised the work of distributing blankets to the poor
 unhone apane kafile ke syran bajaane par pabandi laga di to khud ko jharkhand kaa ‘‘das’’ qaraar diya jo chunautiyon se jujhane ko taiyaar he
 The onset of winter and falling vegetable prices are a relief for the customers, but due to demonetisation on one side and falling prices of vegetables this season, farmers and mandi vendors have been hit twice
 isaki vajah se vikritaon ko apni laagat nikaalane main bhi mushkil ho rahi he
 Prices of vegetables have fallen by half in the last one month
 vikritaon kii maane to is sijan main subjiyon kii paidaavaar acchhee hoti he, lekin is baar note bandi kii vajah se log bahut simit maatra main khariddaari kar rahe hai
 That's why most vegetables become useless
 bekaar hone ke dar se hi mandi main subjiyan bahut sasti ho gai hai
 Carrot prices fell from Rs 30 to Rs 15 per kg, capsicum fell from Rs 50 to Rs 30 per kg, cauliflower fell from Rs 40 to Rs 15 per kg, tomatoes fell from Rs 40 to Rs 10 per kg, peas Rs 40 to Rs 20 per kg and fenugreek leaves
 40 rupees to 10 rupees per kg
 cash kii kami kaa mandi par pad rahaa asedgar retail market kii baat karen, to yahaan bhi vikritaon kaa kahana he ki cash kii kami ke kaaran hi mandi se zyada maal nahin aa paata or aane-jane kaa kharch utana hi he
 That is why vegetables have to be sold in order to extract the cost
 retail market main matar 30 rupee prati kilo, pyaaj 25 rupee prati kilo , tamaato 30 rupee prati kilo, shimla mirch 40 rupee prati kilo or methi 20 rupee kilo bik rahi he
 Beyond cashless business understanding, this means that every vegetable seller is forced to sell 10 to 20 rupees more expensive than the market price and customers are forced to buy
 kul milakar vikretakashlasbhugtan karnaa to chaahate hai, lekin bade holcel bazaar main cashles vyapaar abhi vyapaariyon or kisaanon kii samaj se pare he or isiilie subjiyon ke bazaar main cash se hi khariddaari ho rahi he

 lalu ne apane chit parichit andaaj main kaha ki hamane jabase rail mantri kaa pad chhoda he, koi vahaan tik nahin paa rahaa he or mantralay ‘direld’ ho gaya he
 Lalu said that when he was the Railway Minister, Vishwakarma and Krishna used to keep the idol of God in Rail Bhavan and kept telling them that the responsibility of looking after the rail is on you
 haalanki, lalu ne kaha ki agar unhen ab rail mantri banaaya jayega to ve is pad ko sweekaar nahin karenge lekin unke rail mantri pad ko chhodne ke baad rail ingine kisi ko ukt pad ke liye sweekaar nahin kar paa rahaa he
 When asked about the bjp's demand for the Prime Minister's resignation, Lalu rejected the bjp's demand that the BJP does not see his house and accuses others
 lalu ne daawa kiya ki bijepi ke paas koi agenda nahin he or isi vajah se use karnataka main hue vidhansabha chunaav main use munh kii khaani paddy
 He claimed that if Yeddyurappa had not been removed by the BJP, his position would not have been so bad in the assembly elections held in Karnataka
 lalu ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki gujarat pehle se ek viksit pradesh rahaa he
 Narendra Modi has no contribution in this
 lalu ne aarope lagaaya ki unhone vahaan bohara samudaay ke logon kii hatya karai or unki sampattiyon ko jalaayaa
 Accusing Lalu Prasad of creating an atmosphere of corruption and anarchy in the state during Nitish's tenure, Lalu Prasad alleged that Nitish keeps on moving like an ostrich to hide his failure
 nitish ke bihar model ko khaarij karte hue lalu ne kaha ki bharat nirmaan ke componant ko agar alag kar diya jaae to rajg shasankaal ke dauraan bihar ne apane balboote kya kiya he
 Lalu claimed that the upcoming rally organized by the RJD in Patna on May 15 would be decisive in the direction of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's departure and not fulfilling the dream of sitting on the throne of Delhi through the NDA
 unhone kaha ki is raily main aage kii ranneeti tay kii jaaegi
 Accusing Nitish of being stung over the RJD rally, the RJD supremo said that the motive for organizing the rally is being propagated that he is organizing it to field his son in politics
 rajd supremeo lalu prasad ne nitish par apane putr ko lekar ghatiya bayaan dene kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki vah bataaye ki unke betaa kaa kya str (states) he, vah kya kar rahaa he
 He said, "whether his son or the sons, daughters and wife of other party leaders will not pick up the lanterns, will they hold their arrows (JDU election) and bjp's lotus in hand
" ’jadyu ke pravaktaaon ke bare main lalu ne satta se bedakhal hone ke dar se unke baukhlaaye hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki rajd kii yah parivartan raily unke gharon main lagi aag par pani daalega

 At the age of 15, Macron proposed his school teacher, Bridgit

 Indian cricket team batsman Virat Kohli will soon be made the brand ambassador of the country's largest paramilitary force, the Border Security Force (BSF)
 viraat kohli ko biguef ne apane dhai lakh sainya balon kaa manobal badhaane ke liye brands ambaseder banane kaa faisla kiya he, jo pakistan or bangladesh kii bhartiya seemaa par tainaat rahete hai
 Sources said the top batsman will be honored at a special event in the national capital later this week and will be included in the BSF family
 tippaniyan BSF chief Subhash Joshi and other senior officers of the force will be officially welcomed as brand ambassadors and this young cricketer will talk to people and officials about his game
 yah pehali baar he jab kendriya ardhsainik bal ne brands ambaseder niyukt kiya he
 Kohli played his Test debut in the Test series against the West Indies in 2011 and the 25-year-old batsman has been doing well ever since
 unhone 2011 main bharat kii vishwacap jeet main bhi ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Virat Kohli has been decided by the BSF to be the brand ambassador for boosting the morale of its 2
5 lakh military forces, which are stationed on the Indian border of Pakistan and Bangladesh
 sutron ne kaha ki is sheersh ballebaaj ko rashtriya rajdhani main is hafte ke ant main ek vishesh kaarykram main sammanit kiya jayega or biguef parivaar main shaamil kiya jayega
 The comments biguef pramukh subhash joshi or bal ke anya senior adhikari unka brands ambaseder ke rup main adhikarik swaagat karenge tathaa yah yuva cricketer apane khel ke bare main logon or adhikariyon se baat karegaa
 This is the first time the Central Paramilitary Force has appointed a brand ambassador

 mandi kii maar se bachane ke liye kam aay vaale mahange gagetts na kharidenlagataar ek nirdhaarit raashi sahi jagah par nivesh karte rahanaa chahiedesh kii arthvyavastha maujuuda samay main najuk daur se guzar rahi he
 Business is decreasing, unemployment is increasing
 aisi sthiti tab aati he jab logon ke paas paise nahin hote hai
 Business growth in many sectors of the country is at a two-decade low
 ab tak mandi kii aahat kii baaten ho rahi thi, lekin ab muhar lagati dikh rahi he
 Actually the economic slowdown in India is a matter of concern at this time
 lekin ek aam aadmi mandi se kaise muqabla kare
 However, the economic recession affects every section
 lekin middle class par sabase zyada asar hota he, or philhal ho bhi rahaa he
 In such a situation, low income people can beat the recession by taking some economic steps
 mahange gagetts naa kharidenduniya kii najar main bharat ek bada bazaar he
 Everyday new gadgets are being launched here
 lekin nivesh ke najariye se mahange mobile, tablet or laptop khareednaa kabhi bhi behatar nahin mana jaataa he
 Because the expenses incurred on these gadgets never give returns nor do they get any interest
 isliye mandi kii aahat ke bich kam aay vaale log mahange gajet se duuri banaakar rakhen
 For example, if someone buys a mobile worth 60 thousand rupees, then the value of that gadget decreases after the purchase
 or istemaal ke baad agle kuch maheenon main us mobile ke daam mahaj kuch hajaar rupee rah jaataa he
 Not only this, no gadgets ever have the resale value
 isliye agar aapaki aay simit he to phir aarthik santulan banaae rakhane ke liye maujuuda vakt main 60 hajaar ke bajaay 10 hajaar rupee ke mobile se bhi kaam chalaa sakate hai or baaki ke 50 hajaar rupee ko immergency fund yaa phir sahi jagah par nivesh kar sakate hai
 The amount invested will increase gradually and after a few years it will become a large fund
 aay or kharch ke bich santulan jaruriagar aamadani athnni or kharchaa rupaya he to phir aarthik sehat kabhi nahin sudhar sakati he
 Yes, if the revenue is spent and the cost is high, then any goal can be achieved with the rest of the income
 isliye hameshaa aay se kharch ko neeche rakhane kii koshish karen
 When you strike a balance between income and spending, there will never be a setback on the economic front
 jimmedaari se karen niveshgar aap aay or kharch ke bich talmail bitha lete hai to phir bachat ke raste khul jate hai
 But after saving, one has to decide where to invest that amount
 agar aap ek choti raashi bhi lagaataar sahi jagah par nivesh karte rahenge to aasaani se apane lakshya ko hasil kar sakate hai
 Because there is no formula to become rich in a day
 isliye hameshaa kharch par kaabo or nivesh par focus rakhen

 The camp will strengthen Shivpal Shivpal's new political move may increase Mulayam Singh's difficulties
 kyonki ek tarah unke bete or purv siem akhilesh yadav hai jinaki siyasat pita kii viraasat par tiki he to duusari ore bhai shivpal hai, jinaki mehnat se mulaayam ne samaajawaadee party ko khadaa kiya he

 The Returning Officer said that there is no basis in this objection
 raashtrapati chunaav ke liye nirvachan adhikari or rajyasabha mahasachiv wike agnihotri ne apane aadesh main kaha, ‘mere vichaar se patr par dastakhat karne vaale ko is baat se inkaar karne kaa haq he ki hastakshar uske nahin hai

 ’ He said, 'in the case he himself has submitted a letter which he has claimed to be his letter
 isliye mujhe yah maanane kii koi vajah najar nahin aati ki patr prathamdrishtya vaastavik nahin he
 Sangma had demanded the rejection of Mukherjee's nomination on the grounds that he remained the President of the ISI, a post of profit
 unki is yachika par nirvachan adhikari ne aadesh jari kiya
 Sangma's representative Satyapal Jain had argued that according to the information available on the website of the Lok Sabha and the ISI, Mukherjee was also called the chairman of the institute on July 2, the date of the nomination papers
 mukherjee ke pratinidhi or sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne mukherjee ke alag alag dastakhton kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki iesai adhyaksh mjike menon ko bheje patr main unke ‘saamaanya hastakshar’ hai jabaki nirvachan adhikari ko diye halafname main unhone usee tarah se dastakhat kiye hai, jaise ki unhone namakan patr par aupchaarik tareeke se kiye hai

 a senior BJP strategist comments on the changed scenario, "we did not want the election of Bihar to stray from the issue of development, but despite Lalu's statement, the election has gained credibility, which will directly benefit us
" ” darasal, shah ko andaja he ki loksabhaa chunaav jaisi modi lahar nahin he or jati samikarnon se upje nae gathbandhan (lalu-nitish) kii vajah se ladaai kaante kii ho chuki he
 Therefore, Shah, who is considered to be an expert in micro management, had devised a strategy to create saffron wave in Bihar just before the ticket distribution, which was given a chance by Lalu's statement, and Shah did not delay to camp in Patna

 After all, why did the Derashah Brigade have to travel from Delhi to Patna with Lashkar
 loksabhaa chunaav kii jeet ke baad bijepi jab bihar chunaav kii shuruaati taiyaari kar rahi thi to use laga ki chunavi aabhohawaa puri tarah se uske paksh main he or vah aandhi kii tarah aage badhate hue bihar kii satta par kabiz ho jaaegi
 But when work started at the ground level, BJP realized that the contest was not easy
 vah yah maanakar chal rahi thi ki lalu ke saath haath milaane se nitish janata main puri tarah se badnaam ho jaaenge or sushasan tathaa jangalraj ke cocktail ko janata jubaan par chadhgaye bhi nahin degi
 But this did not happen, the opposite turned into a tough and interesting one
 jati kaa ankaganit bhi mahagathbandhan ke paksh main jaataa dikhaa to shah ko lag gaya ki dilli main baithkar vikaas ke mudde par chunavi ranneeti ko sire chadha paanaa sambhav nahin hoga

 But Shah Brigade's strategist Election Incharge Anant Kumar and co-election Incharge Dharmendra Pradhan spent entire 7 days just talking to the rebels and persuading them
 haalanki abhi bhi aadha darjan se zyada baagi maidan main date hue hai
 He claims that now rebel candidates are not as headache for the party as they were a week ago
 lekin shah ko patna tak khinch laane main tikataarthiyon kii naaraazgi bhi ek badi vajah he
 The party estimates that 20-22 people, including small parties and independents fighting on the basis of two alliances fighting in the Bihar elections, can win
 isliye trishanku vidhansabha kii sthiti main party pehle se hi in logon ko apane paale main khinchne kii ranneeti par bhi kaam kar rahi he
 As the Shahnuma Khakamatdan dates of management are getting closer, the beating of BJP leadership is also increasing
 party ranneeti kaa ek bhi sutara chhodia nahin chaahati
 The party, which is already working by dividing Bihar into four zones, has now created 12 new zones and has put senior leaders in charge of districts from Union Minister

 Shah then visits different areas throughout the day and churns out the entire day's review and strategy for the next day with his core team until the third hour of the night
 bihar chunaav kis tarah bijepi kii shah-modi jodi ke liye pratishtha kaa prashn ban gaya he, ise bihar ke ek varisht netaa kii is tippanee se sahaj samajha ja saktaa he, “agar bihar chunaav main lage hue netaaon ko dekhen to in dinon shah sabase vyast netaa hai, jinaki chhavi sabase deree se sone vaale or sabase jaldi jagakar party daftar pahunchane vaale shaks kii he
 "shah has also divided his core team into three categories, one of which is only political strategy, the other is the organizational team and the third team is of the three senior leaders of the state who look for coordination at the lower level
 shah pradesh main kahin bhi tour par hon, lekin waar room se ek din main teen baar khud report lete hai jisamen booth prabandhan, prachaar saamagree, kol centre kii jaankaree hoti he
 Apart from this, through the war room itself, keep an eye on where in the assembly constituency, where the hoardings depicting the party's manifesto (vision document) are located and where it should be installed, the promotional material sent from Patna is being used properly
 Shah keeps a close watch on small things like it or not
 bijepi ke ek ranneetikaar bataate hai, “shah kisi bhi baithak main vidhansabha ke bare main kuch poochne kii bajaae sirf booth kii baat karte hai or hameshaa is baat par focus karte hai ki booth kaaryakarta apane ghar-parivaar or padosi ko utsahit karen taaki logon ko matdaan centre tak laayaa ja sake
 "instead of panicking about Shah's camp in Patna, state leaders add to the decision quickly and local leaders believe that the presence of the president himself is making all the decisions go haywire and any confusion or green signal from Delhi Do not have to wait
 rojaanaa 8 helicopter subah hi udaan bharte hai jisamen endie ke ghatak dalon ke netaaon kaa tour bhi bijepi kii ore se tay kiya jaataa he
 Shah's organizational preparations are overseen by the National Organization General Secretary Ramlal himself while sitting in Patna, while the responsibility of giving him an edge on the land is mainly being handled by the National Co-organization Minister Saudan Singh and the Bihar unit's Organization Minister Nagendra

 isliye party ne pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi kii har loksabhaa kshetra main ek-ek raily kii ranneeti banaai thi lekin aisa karne se ghabrahat kaa sandesh jaataa
 Therefore, the party has now taken Modi's consent to campaign for two days at every stage and a strategy of 22 rallies has been chalked out under it

 His wife Shivani has filed a domestic violence case in Borivali court against actor Deepak Tijori
 kuch samay pehle hi shivani ne deepak ko goregaanv ke 4bhk flats se baahar nikaal diya tha
 He also filed a divorce case
 lekin baad main deepak ko pataa chalaa ki shivani ne apane pehle pati se talaak hi nahin liya he isliye wo unki kanoonee taur par patni nahin hai
 What is the controversy: Shivani used to allow Deepak to use only one room in his house if the news was to be believed
 unhone ghar ke naukaron ko yah aadesh diya tha ki wo deepak ke liye naa khaanaa banaaenge or naa hi unka cameraa saaf karenge
 Hence Deepak mostly spent his time at PG or a friend's house
 actor deepak tijori se jisane maanga talaak, shaadi karke bhi vah nahin he unki patnishivani kaa aarope:shivani ne deepak par aarope lagaaya tha ki unka ek yoga instractor ke saath afaire he, jo umr main unase kaaphi choti hai
 Case for maintenance allowance: Shivani filed a case under 125 CRPC and said that i cannot make a living
 deepak isamen sakasham hai isliye wo meri or meri beti ke rakrakhaav kaa kharch den
 However, Shivani is not Deepak's legal wife, so the case for maintenance is baseless
 kis shart par shivani ko mil sakate hai paise:shivani bhale hi cese nahin kar sakati lekin kanoon ke hisaab se unki 20 saal kii beti samaara cese kar apane pita se apni parvarish ke liye paise maang sakati hai

 Since then, freedom fighters associated with the movement also started wearing white caps on the head
 baad main yahi netaaon kii poshaak ho gai
 The cap was named 'gandhi Topi'
 swatantraaa andolan se jude log aaj bhi gandhi topi pahananaa nahin bhoolatey
 Gradually, due to the era of modernity and fashion, leaders stopped wearing hats
 uski jagah gamche ne le lee
 The trend started with the leaders and activists of political parties keeping a shoulder on the shoulder according to the color of their party
 party kaaryakramon main gamche ke saath hat jaisi topi bhi lagane kii parampara shuru ho gai
 Hat and hoard demand also increased in hat and flag banner shops
 lekin april 2011 main shuru hue anna andolan ke baad ek baar phir 'gandhi topi' kii maang bad gai
 The difference was that instead of plain hat, the hat written on either side of 'I am Anna' or 'I want Jan Lokpal' came down in the market
 ise logon ne 'anna topi' bhi kahana shuru kiya
 At that time, Anna Hazare's movement was strongly supported all over the country
 sadak par nikal rahe logon ke sir par topi jarur hoti thi
 The effect of 'anna Topi' increased so much that at present, almost all parties started using the cap
 chaahe bijepi ho, congress ho yaa anya partiyaan
 In party programs, instead of a hat like hat on the head of the workers, Gandhi-style cap started appearing again
 bijepi vaale kesaria, to congressi kesaria, haraa va safed dhari vaali topi lagaae najar aa rahe hai
 BSP workers also started wearing the same style cap in blue
 tapiyon par tarah ke vaakya bhi likhe rahete hai
 Various organizations agitating with political parties are also raising their voices by wearing caps
 andolan ke liye vah topi kaa pehle se order de rahe hai
 In this regard, Rajesh Aggarwal of Sheela Inter Prizes, wholesalers of flag, banners and hats of political parties, says, 'with the Anna movement, the demand for hats has increased a lot
 pehle gandhi topi kii saal main hajaar-paanch sau ke aasapaas bikri hoti thi
 There was a special demand on 15 August and 26 January and Gandhi Jayanti, but now the demand has increased so much that it is difficult to supply
 'raajnneetik partiyon ke saath-saath anya sanghathan bhi topi kaa order book kara rahe hai
 An average of five to seven thousand Gandhi hats are coming in demand every month
 abhi to aam chunaav aana baaki he, aage-aage dekhie hota he kya

 There may be uproar in UP elections in the country, but in Delhi, the arrogance for the Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee is no less than a big election
 dilli kii raajnneeti se jo log waakif hai, unhen dsipisi chunaav kii ahmamiyat bhi maaloom hoti he, kyonki dilli sikh gurudwara prabandhak cameti par kaabiz hone kaa matlab sikh raajnneeti ke rukh kaa ishaara bhi hoti he
 The elections of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee are to be held on 26 February and a fierce competition is going on for this
 philhal dsipisi par shiromani akali dal ke manjit singh jike gut kaa kabza he or takkar main akali dal dilli ke sarna bandhu hai
 However, this time a new faction called Panthak Seva Dal is also in the fray and it is being said that Panthak Seva Dal has the support of Aam Aadmi Party
 dsipisi ke liye dilli main kul 46 ward hai, jinke tahat dillibhar ke gurudwaron kaa prabandhan aata he
 In addition, DSGPC also runs several schools, colleges, hospitals and other social institutions
 is baar dsipisi kii 46 siton ke liye kul 376 ummidavaar maidan main hai or muqabla kaante kaa mana ja rahaa he
 It is believed that the election results of DSGPC in Delhi indicate the political air of Punjab
 haalanki is baar punjab ke chunaav dsipisi ke chunaavon se pehle ho gaye, lekin dsipisi ke nattejey punjab vidhansabha ke nateezon ke pehle aa jaaenge
 Not only this, Panthak Seva Dal, a party claiming support of the Aam Aadmi Party is also in the fray, so Kejriwal's party's base in Delhi's Sikh society is also being estimated from these elections
 haalanki aam aadmi party khulkar samarthan dene se gurez kar rahi he
 However, this time Paramjit Sarna, who is considered to be a supporter of Congress, is claiming his victory and accusing the Shiromani Akali Dal of wrongdoing
 sarna kaa kahana he ki manjit singh jike ke kaarykaal main sikh dharm kii brudabi hui he or ek dharmik sanstha ko puri tarah raajnneetik bana diya he
 At the same time, Manjinder Singh Sirsa of GK faction is claiming that the reality of the Sarna brothers came to the fore during their last tenure
 isliye ab sikh samaaj ke log un par bharosa karne vaale nahin he
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party is secretly trying to interfere in the gurdwara elections, but they have no basis and they will be all around
 in dauraan donon hi partiyaan daawa kar rahi hai ki unhone kisi bhi raajnneetik dal se na to madad lee he or na hi kisi netaa ko chunaav prachaar ke liye istemaal kiya he, lekin gurudware kaa yah chunaav itani gairraajnneetik bhi nahin he
 Well after voting on 26 February, the results of the Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee will come out on 1 March
 bhale hi ye chunaav gurudwaron kaa prabandhan karne vaali cameti ke hon, lekin nattejey kai raajnneetik ishaara karne vaale honge
 After the # metoo campaign running in the country against sexual exploitation, the former judge has also come after the actor and leader
 ek mahila vakil ne purv atorni general soli psorabji ke khilaaf supreme court main PIL daayar karte hue unpar lagaataar yon utpeedan karne ke aarope lagaae hai
 Sorabji in his conversation with Aaj Tak has termed all these allegations as baseless and false
 unhone aaropon par safai dete hue kaha ki logon ke khilaaf aarope lagaana unki (mahila vakil) aadat he or pehle bhi wo kai jajon or vakeelon par aise aarope laga chuki hai
 Sorabji said that he will not go to court against the woman but he is definitely feeling sorry for her
 purv atorni general ne kaha ki us mahila ko wo hameshaa se ek junior vakil ke taur par dekhte aae hai, pataa nahin kyon mahila ne unpar aise aarope lagaae hai
 Sorabji has called the allegations fabricated
 soli psorabji ke khilaaf yachika aise vakt main daayar kii gai he jab centre sarkaar main mantri emje akbar se lekar abhinayta naanaa patekar, alok nath, rajat kapur, gayak kailash kher, lekhak chetan bhagat tak in aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 Under this campaign, women who have faced sexual harassment from workplace to private places are openly filing their complaints on social media
 campan ko tehraaya jaijasorabji ne bhi is # metoo campan ko sahi tehraate hue kaha ki acchhee baat he, kyonki is bahaane mahilaayein khulkar bol rahi hai
 However, raising doubts about the wrong complaints, he has also suspected the misuse of the campaign, which may tarnish someone's image
 purv atorni general ne kaha ki jo bhi mahilaayein aarope laga rahi hai unase saboot ke saath-saath yah bhi poocha jaae ki wo abtak kyon saamne nahin ain
 If it does not, these allegations can only spoil someone's image

 Like, the creator of more than one song, Anand Bakshi had brought the desire to become a singer in Mayanagari but became a lyricist
 zindagi kii talkh anubhavon ko jab shabd main piroyaa to har aadmi kii zindagi kisi na kisi sire se us geet se jud gayi
 Anand Bakshi, who composed more than 4000 songs, goes into every heart as simple as the simple lyrics he has written

 Before becoming a lyricist, he had worked in the Navy and as a motor mechanic
 anand bakshi ko pehali baar bhagwaan dada ne apni film bada aadmi (1956) ke liye geet likhane ko kaha
 But this did not bring them success
 'mehadi lagi mere haath(1962)' or 'jab-jab phool khile(1965)' kii safalataa milane tak unhen sangharsh karnaa padaa
 With the performance of these films, they started gaining popularity
 'paradesiyon se na ankhiyaan milaanaa' or 'yah samaa he pyaar kaa' jaise laajawab geeton ne unhen bahut lokapriy bana diya
 After this, with the performance of the film 'milan (1967)', he topped the songwriters' category
 unhen phir kabhi peeche mud ke dekhne kii zarurat nahin padi
 Anand Bakshi, a successful composer of love songs, collaborated with music composer laxmikant-pyarelal for 'farz (1967)', 'do Rasta (1969)', 'bobby (1973'), 'amar Akbar Anthony (1977)', 'ek Duje Ke' Lyrics (1981) 'and along with Rahul Dev Burman, gave songs like' Kati Patang (1970) ',' Amar Prem (1971) ', Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971) and' Love Story (1981) '
 anand bakshi ne raaj kapur ke liye 'bobi(1973)', 'satyam shivam sundaram(1978)'; subhash ghai ke liye 'karz(1980)', 'hero(1983)', 'karma(1986)', 'ram-lakhan(1989)', 'saudagar(1991)', 'khalanaayak(1993)', 'taal(1999)' evam 'yaaden(2001)'; or yash chopra ke liye 'chandani(1989)', 'lamhe(1991)', 'dar(1993)', 'dil to pagal he(1997)'; aditya chopra ke liye 'dilavaale dulhaniya le jaayenge(1995)', 'mohabbatein(2000)' filmon main sadabahaar geet likhe
 Jeevananand Bakshi, given to many singers, has also written the lyrics of the first song of many singers like Shailendra Singh, Udit Narayan, Kumar Sanu, Kavita Krishnamurthy and SP Balasubrahmanyam

 The government has argued that the order was issued by mistake earlier
 isse pehle jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said ne bijepi ko ek or jhatka diya tha haalanki vivaad badhate hi sarkaar ne faisla waapas le liya
 Earlier, the state government had issued an order saying that now it will be necessary to hoist the state flag along with the tricolor at the people sitting on constitutional posts in the state and all the buildings where the Indian tricolor is hoisted
 aisa na karne par sajaa kaa praavdhaan rakhaa gaya he
 This decision of the Mufti government was considered to be a 'response' to the bjp's demand and the slogan in which it has been demanding the removal of two constitutions and two marks from the state
 khabar he ki mufti sarkaar ke is adhyadesh ko laane kii vajah he ki bijepi ke kuch mantri apane sarkari vaahanon se rajya kaa jhanda lagane main anakani kar rahe the
