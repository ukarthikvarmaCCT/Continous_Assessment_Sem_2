 If Trump extends the scope of these higher rates, then it is expected that there will be a trade war

 All these things can make the WTO consistently irrelevant

 But India should not be suppressed by such antics

 There are no differences or cracks of any kind in the NDA
 unhone apane daawey ke paksh main jediu saansad harivansh narayan singh ko rajyasabha ke upasabhapati pad ke liye endie kii ore se utaarne ke faisle kaa zikr kiya
 Shah lashed out at the opposition solidarity against the Modi government
 bhaajapa ke netritv vaali endie kii ekajutata par jor dete hue unhone kaha ki modi sarkaar ke khilaaf vipakshi ekajutata kii baat kii ja rahi he, lekin modi sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav or rajyasabha upasabhapati chunaav main jo hua, usko sabane dekha he
 Shah said that there was no concrete reason for bringing the no-confidence motion
 vipakshi dalon ke saansadon ko apane paksh main laane ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki kuch log dal se upar uthakar bhi vot karte hai
 On the question of protest and friendship with Nitish Kumar, he said that Nitish decided that he does not want to live with corruption and he came with us
 jab unase kaha gaya ki bijepi har rajya main teji se vistaar kar rahi he, jisase sahyogi dal apane astitv ko lekar ashankit hai
 To this, Amit Shah said, "we want to strengthen the BJP at every booth so that we can win our allies in the elections
" bhaajapa majboot hogi, to sahyogi partiyon ko chunaav jeetne main bhi madad milegi
 When the BJP president was asked if there are no differences in the NDA, why are Naresh Gujral and Sanjay Raut saying that the BJP needs to behave like Vajpayee to win the election? To this, Shah said, 'I want to say with confidence that all the constituents of NDA are with BJP
 endie main matbhed kii afvaah failaane waalon ko kuch hasil nahin hone vaala he
 The constituents of the NDA in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha have gone and voted in favor of the BJP to prove that there is no difference in the NDA
 hamane bahumat hasil karne ke baavjood sahyogi dalon ko saath rakhaa
 When Amit Shah was asked that PM Modi asked the opposition to bring a no-confidence motion again in 2024
 kya iskaa matlab yah he ki phir se modi sarkaar banegi? is par amit shah ne kaha ki desh kii janata 2019 main phir se modi ko bahumat degi
 We will take to the public the account of the work of the last five years and the blueprint for the next five years
 janata kii ankhen or bhav sab bayaan kar dete hai ki wo modi ko phir se jitaane ja rahi he
 Amit Shah said that the BJP will get a bigger majority in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections than in 2014
 desh kii janata modi ko phir se pradhanmantri banane kaa man bana chuki he
 We have no doubt about it
 shah ne bainkon ke saath dhokhadhadi ke aaropee mehul chokasee or neerav modi ke desh se bhaagane ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki unke khilaaf modi sarkaar kii lagaataar karrwai se sunishchit hoga ki desh main ab kam chor honge

 The head of the Indian Overseas Congress, Sam Pitroda, said on Monday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have similarities in their campaigning strategy as both believe in playing with people's feelings
 vah digital yug main raajnneetik prachaar vishay par bol rahe the
 He said that the digital age is of sound bytes, tricks and videos
 yah usase thik ulta he jab patrkaar gaharaai tak jaakar vishleshan karte the
 Sam Pitroda, a confidant of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, had earlier clarified on his statement related to Pulwama
 unhone kaha tha ki unhone javaanon yaa shastr balon ke liye kuch bhi apmanjanak nahin kaha
 Along with this, he had sparked controversy over his remarks by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top government officials for allegedly questioning the claims of airstrikes on terrorist camps in Pakistan
 
 sam ne kaha ki unki tippaniyon ke jis 40 minute ke tap ne tufaan khadaa kar rakhaa he, vah har kisi ke liye uplabdh he or yadi koi usamen aisa kuch nikaal den jo hamaare javaanon yaa hamaari sena ke liye kahin se apmanjanak he, to main khushi-khushi maafee maangane ko taiyaar hum, yadi aisa nahin he to main unhen (pradhanmantri, jetali or amit shah ko) ek saarvajanik manch par bahes karne kii chunauti detaa hum
 He said, "what the hell is this?" 
 You can violate someone's character

 i changed my American citizenship to Indian and you want to attack me through lies
 " unhone kaha ki 40 minute ke video main kahin bhi jaraa bhi vasa kuch nahin he, jaisaa pradhanmantri yaa amit shah ne kaha he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said on the comment of Sam Pitroda that the Congress court has accepted what the country already knows - Congress did not want to take action against terrorist forces
 modi ne likhaa he, "vipaksh samay-samay par hamaare balon kaa apmaan karata hai
 i appeal to my Indian people, ask opposition leaders questions on their statements
 unhen bataaen ki 130 karod bhartiya vipaksh ko unki nakaaratmakataa ke liye maaf nahin karenge
 "when IANS wanted to know Pitroda's side on the Balakot strike, he said it is difficult to say
 unhone kaha, "maine sirf sawaal puche
 You said that 300 people died
 maine saboot maange
 As a citizen of the country, i have a right to it

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has given its response to Congress President Ahul Gandhi's Mansarovar
 viechapine kaha he ki ham nahin jaanate ki rahul gandhi hindu hai yaa nahin, lekin agar wohindu dharmaka paalan karte hai to unka yah kadam swaagat yogya he
 Addressing the press conference in Lucknow, VHP international general secretary Milind Parande said, "we do not know whether Rahul Gandhi is a Hindu or not but if he follows Hinduism then we all should welcome him
" mujhe lagata he ki desh main har kisi ko hindu dharm kaa paalan karnaa chahie or rajanetaaon ko iskaa prachaar karnaa chahie
 'you may know that Rahul Gandhi, who has described himself as' Shiva devotee' many times, has recently returned from the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra
 31 agast ko yatra par nikle rahul gandhi ne 13 ghante tak kareeb 34 kilometre paidal chalakar apni yatra puri kii thi
 When Milind Parande was recently asked a question about Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting the mosque in Indore, he said that this PM can tell why he went to the mosque
 ham nahin jaanate ki unke dimag main kya chal rahaa he
 Let me tell you that BJP has always been questioning Rahul's Hindu status
 bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa sambit paatra rahul gandhi ke janeu par sawaal uthaate hue ichhadhari hindu tak kah chuke hai
 Sambit had said that Rahul becomes Hindu when the opportunity comes
 gujarat ke siyaasi maidan main amit shah ne bhale hi kamyaabi ke jhde gaad kar apni santhnik kshamta ko sabit kiya ho, lekin unhen jab aam chunaavon main mulaayam or mayawati kii dharti par apana asar dikhaane kii chunauti saunpi gai to unke prashansak bhi maanakar chal rahe the ki yah kaam narendra modi ke daayen haath ke vash main nahin he
 There was not even a year left in polling when this skilled strategist took charge of the party's campaign in the state and after reaching the heights in the nineties, the fast lost ground workers and the party was severely reduced in terms of electoral figures
 Rejuvenated
 uttar pradesh kii kul 80 siton main se 71 par bijepi kii jeet ne na sirf ise centre kii satta main pahunchaa diya balki gathbandhan ke lambey chale daur kaa khaatmaa karke nirnaayak rajkaaj ke laayak ise bahumat bhi pradaan kiya
 Shah's appointment to the post of BJP president is not only a tribute to the bumper election crop in Uttar Pradesh, but is also a sign of the sharing of power between a mentor and his disciple who will coordinate both the party and the government
 bijepi ke ab tak ke sabase yuva adhyaksh ne ahmedabad ke guestaouse main senior editor udai mahurkar se rajyon ke aagaamee chunaavon kii chunautiyon, party sambandhi apni dirghakaalik yojanaon or sarkaar ke saath milakar kaam karne kii jarurat jaise masalon par baat kii
 What is your biggest challenge as the newly appointed President of BJP? i see it as work
 hamane loksabhaa chunaavon main spasht bahumat hasil kar ke sabase badi chunauti se paar paa liya he
 Now we have five tasks in front of us
 mukhya kaam bijepi ko sarkaar or janata ke bich ek majboot kadi ke taur par sthapit karnaa he
 After that we have to develop a solid vote-gathering system by strengthening the organization in those states where our votes have increased but we have not been able to convert them into enough seats, or where there is scope to increase seats, such as West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh
 phir hamen maharashtra samet anya rajyon ke aagaamee chunaavon main loksabhaa jaisi hi shandaar jeet darj kerani he
 We have to increase the membership of the party, taking advantage of our current popularity
 or ant main, hamen santhnik majbootee laane ke liye party kaaryakartaaon ke liye ek prashikshan kaarykram kii shuruyaat bhi kerani he
 Even when Narendra Bhai was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he used to emphasize this a lot because he always believed that the party organization has a decisive role in making the government's programs public
 party sanghathan ke liye koun se prastaavit badlaav aapke dimag main hai?ham aise kshetron main pahunchnaa chaahate hai jahaan hamaari maujuudagi nahin he or iske liye ham i-panjikaran jaise tareeke apanaayenge
 We need to use technology more and more to bring people closer to the party
 ham ek nayaa software laa rahe hai jo desh main hone vaale chote se chote aagaamee chunaav ke bare main dilli main baithe party adhyaksh or anya padaadhikariyon ko pehle hi soochna de degaa
 We also need to put more emphasis on grassroots ideological training
 yah bhi aashwast karne kii jarurat he ki deshbhar ke hamaare prakashnon main ek taratamya bana rahe taaki party kii ore se ek majboot or samaan sandesh desh bhar main pahunch sake
 We wish to find new ways to bring the youth who have been disillusioned with the current political developments
 ab jabaki centre kii kaman bijepi ke haathon main he, to kya satta hathiyanna rosemara kii baat nahin ho jaaegi?koi party jab satta main aati he to yah koi asaamaanya cheez nahin hoti, lekin bijepi or sangh main kaaryakartaaon kii ek samoochee fouj he jo apane vaicharik poshan ke chalate satta se aprabhavit rahati he
 You are the right hand man of Narendra Modi
 ab chunki aap party ke prabharee hai, to party or sarkaar ke bich vaajapeyi sarkaar ke daur vaali dikkaton kaa doharaav na ho, uski kya gunjaaish hogi?main narendrabhai kaa daayan haath hum, yah media kii banaai dharna he
 There is no specific relationship between us
 ve har us kaaryakarta par bharosa karte hai jo mehnat karata he or jiske paas nattejey dene kaa hunar or kshamta hoti he
 The party's job is to play the role of a bridge between the government and the public
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ke vakt hamaare paas purna bahumat nahin tha
 This is not the case this time
 aap sirf 49 saal ke hai
 Are you afraid of such a big responsibility? My responsibility is to take bjp's victory procession forward
 yah kaam ek aadmi kaa nahin he, yah timwork hota he
 Even the credit given to me for the performance of Uttar Pradesh alone was teamwork
 vaajapeyi ke daur main vaicharik vishyon par sangh kaa dabaav ek ahm masalaa tha
 How will you deal with it? The media's perception that the RSS interferes with everyday work is wrong
 lekin sangh ke netaa ram madhav ke bijepi main shaamil hone se to party par sangh kii pakad or kasegi?sangh kaaryakarta kaa bijepi main shaamil hona puraani parampara he
 i am also an activist of the Sangh
 modi ke saath itane lambey samay tak jude rahane par aapaki sabase badi kamai kya he?narendrabhai ne mujhe sikhaaya he ki yadi aap pratikul sthitiyon main prayaas karte rahen to aap apni manzil tak jarur pahunchenge
 He has restored public confidence in the multi-party democratic system and has proved in Gujarat that good governance is possible within this existing system
 unhone rajkaaj ke jo siddhant gadhe hai, unke shandaar nattejey ab rashtriya str par bhi bilashak dekhne ko milenge
 What is Amit Shah without Modi? Modi has nothing to do with an Amit Shah
 aapke peeche kii takat kya he? sibiai ne soharabuddin shaikh farji muthbhed ke maamle main aapako jail bhej diya tha
 You are still on bail? i do not disappoint with unnecessary criticism
 mere khilaaf farji muthbhed vaale mukademe rajnatik dushprachaar kaa hissaa hai
 i do my work whole-heartedly and take everyone along in the party
 aapako kattar hindutvvaadi ke taur par dekha jaataa he
 How do Muslims see your appointment? i am bound by the slogan "sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas" given by our Prime Minister
 meri muslim virdohi chhavi media kii gadhi hui he
 i am against the appeasement of only one section
 yah hamaari party kii vichaardhaara he
 But you did not give a single Muslim ticket in the Lok Sabha elections from BJP in Uttar Pradesh? This was the party's decision
 ham tikat bantwaare main hindu yaa musalmaan ko nahin dekhte
 Our criterion is who can win
 lekin party ke chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan uttar pradesh main aapane muslim virdohi bayaan to die hi the?yah galat baat he
 Through those statements, i tried to bring out the conspiracies and misrule of the Uttar Pradesh government against political opponents
 maine ek baar bhi ‘muslim’ shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya
 The Modi government has allocated Rs 100 crore for modernization of madrasas in its first budget
 kya yah tushtikaran nahinhai?madrason kaa aadhunikeekaran hamaare ghoshnaptr kaa hissaa he
 It is our aim that apart from religious education, modern education can also be imparted in madrasas
 ise tushtikaran kahana galat hoga
 How will you win the trust of senior party leaders? They already trust me
 main unke bharose or samarthan se hi adhyaksh bana hum
 You are credited that you have created a whole pool of OBC leadership in Uttar Pradesh by giving tickets to committed OBC workers with RSS-BJP background
 kya aap baaki jagahon par bhi aisa hi karne vaale hai?hamaare mahaan netaa pandit dinadayal upaadhyaay ne antyoday kii pariklpana kii thi-yani vikaas ke fal garibon tak pahunchane kii kalpana kii gai he
 Actually, we are doing what we have been taught in our ideology
 filmekar arbaj khan ko nahin lagata ki unke 'dabang' superstar bhai salmaan khan kii jindagi par film banaai ja sakati he
 He does not mind making a film on Salman
 yah puche jane par ki kya aap salmaan ke jivan par film banaaenge? jawaab main bade bhaiya arbaj ne kaha, 'aisa ho saktaa he, lekin main jivit vyakti ke jivan par film nahin bananaa chaahunga
 'arbaaz said,' Usually biopic is made of people, about whom people know little
 mujhe nahin lagata ki agar koi pehle se mashhoor he or har koi uske jivan ke bare main jaanata he, to uski byopic banane kaa koi tuk he
 Regarding the film being made on Indian cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, he said that the film will be a challenge for director Neeraj Pandey
 unhone kaha, 'mere khyaal se dhoni kii byopic niraj pandeya ke liye badi chunauti hogi, kyonki ham sab dhoni ke bare main jaanate hai
 We are all excited to see what will be new in it

 - input bhashaa Shiv Sena, unable to come out of the image of bjp's elder brother, when there was no one with BJP, even then Bala Saheb was running parallel to power in Maharashtra, Shiv Sena's rule, i will say that Kamalabai will do the same
 ' ye baat assi ke dashak main aksar bala sahib thakare bolaa karte the
 By Kamla Bai, she meant the lotus party ie Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 shaayad shivasena ke bheetar bijepi ke liye vahi bhav sthai ghar kar gaya he
 This is also the reason
 jansangh ke baad jab sangh kii nai raajnneetik ikai bijepi bani to use siyasat main apane astitv ke liye lambii ladaai ladani padi
 At one time, the BJP was considered a politically untouchable party
 koi bhi dal kendriya raajnneeti main bijepi ke saath gathbandhan ko taiyaar nahin thi
 The Shiv Sena supported the BJP in that period
 ye wo daur tha jab mumbai main bala sahib kii tuuti bolti thi
 His order was considered above any administrative order
 ek samanaantar satta kii tarah chalata tha shivasena kaa shashan
 With the passage of time, the BJP, which entered the Ranjiiti of Maharashtra, increased its strength by riding on the shoulder of Shiv Sena
 uski haisiyat chote bhai se bade bhai main tabdeel ho gai
 The number truth is the biggest truth in a democracy and in that truth the Shiv Sena lags somewhere
 ab seat to shivasena kii kam hui lekin uski hanak kam nahin hui
 The insistence of the Jiv Shiv Sena The insistence of the people to express their views in recent times is the identity of the Shiv Sena since the time of Balasaheb
 darasal pichley kareeb paanch dashakon se shivasena mumbai main satta kaa paryaay bani hui he
 Even if ever eaten in the assembly, the unbroken Shiv Sena state on BMC continued
 marathi asmita ke bahaane vahaan ke marathi logon kii ragon main shivasena or khaastaur par balasaheb is tarah rach bas gaye hai
 At first glance, even though people consider Shiv Sena to go with NCP and Congress, it is different from its original spirit, but in politics many things are beyond but
 jab shivasena thi vasant senamaharashtra kii raajnneeti ko samajhane vaale is baat ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki bala sahib or shivasena ko shuruyaat main khadaa karne ke peeche bhi congress kaa hi haath rahaa he
 The ruling Congress party at that time supported Bal Thackeray for nearly two decades
 us dauraanlaal jhande waalon kaa mumbai main bada bolbalaa tha
 Tired of agitation on everything, the then Congress government of Maharashtra wanted a person to answer it
 bala sahib main congress ko wo jawaab dikh gaya
 The Congress took help from Thackeray in breaking the communist movement
 badale main shivasena ko khadaa karne main unka sahyog kiya
 Vasantrao Nayak was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra in those days
 shivasena ko lekar unke soft carnor kii vajah se log majaak main shivasena ko tab ‘vasant sena’ bhi kehete the
 Even after Santrao Nayak, support of Indira, the Shiv Sena was seen standing with the Congress on several occasions
 isamen sabase ahm vakt wo tha jab bala sahab ne apatkaal ko lekar tatkaleenpradhanmantri indira gandhi kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Not only this, when Indira Gandhi was arrested in 1978, Shiv Sena also called for a shutdown against her
 ensipi ke saath rishta puranamaharashtra main aagaamee sarkaar kii ruparekha tay karne vaale sharad pavaar ke saath shivasena kaa rishta bahut hi purana he
 Pawar was among those whom Bala Saheb used to call at his family dinner
 apni aatmakatha 'on maai terms' main sharad pavaar ne likhaa he- bala sahib ne agar ek baar aapako apana dost bol diya to bol diya
 He always kept his friendship
 ye vakya sitambar, 2006 kaa he jab meri beti supriya rajyasabha chunaav ladane vaali thi
 Bala Saheb called me
 wo bole, 'sharad babu main sun rahaa hum, hamaari supriya chunaav ladane ja rahi he or tumne mujhe iske bare main bataaya hi nahin
 Why am i getting this news from others? "" i said, 'shiv sena-bjp alliance has already fielded candidates against it
 maine sochaa main aapako kyon pareshaan karun
 Bal Thackeray said - i know Supriya since she used to be on my knees
 meraa koi bhi ummidavaar supriya ke kilaaf chunaav nahin ladega
 Your daughter is my daughter
 maine unase poocha- aap bijepi kaa kya karenge?unhone jawaab diya- kamalabai kii chintaa mat karo
 She will do what i say
 kyon saath aa rahi shivasenasambandhon kii inhen majbootee ke dam par aaj shivesna ensipi or congress ke saath sarkaar banane kaa bada kadam uthaa rahi he
 It is said that in politics, along with the enemy, his friend also has to show strength
 shivasena is baar bijepi ko apni vahi andruni takat dikhaa rahi he
 However, this is not the first time this distance of Shiv Sena with BJP has happened
 khaastaur par 2014 main centre main modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad sthiti tanaavpurn kai baar najar ai
 In the coming days, there was a headline criticizing the BJP
 gharelu se lekar antarrashtriya muddon par shivasena kaa rukh sarkaar ke saath rahete hue bhi alag najar aata tha
 Love of you, Shiv sena-bjp was on the lines of fighting with you
 shuruaati khinchataan se sabko yahi lag rahaa tha ki ek duusare ke saath saudebaaji kar donon phir saath hi sarkaar banaaenge lekin ab baat bahut aage bad chuki he
 Shiv Sena is only blaming BJP for this
 satta ke 50-50 bantwaare kii baat ko lekar bala sahib kii saughandh kha rahi he
 Have confessed with NCP and Congress to make them their chief minister
 shaayad ye endie ke do sabase puraane doston main siyaasi dushmani kii shuruyaat he
 What is the politics of politics? This is the politics of politics
 jab bhi kii dal majboot sthiti main hoti to duusare par apni shart thopati he
 Before the 2019 elections, when the atmosphere in the country was not seen in favor of Prime Minister Modi in that way, the BJP in Maharashtra bowed down and compromised with the Shiv Sena
 pichhali baar kii tulana main kam siton par samjhauta kiya
 It is different that when the result came in his favor
 pehle se zyada takat ke saath pradhanmantri modi satta main waapas aae
 After this, the first rift was seen on the day of swearing in when Shiv Sena got only one place in the cabinet
 us vakt maharashtra ke vidhansabha chunaav par nazren gadaaye shivasena ne chuppi saadhe rakhi lekin vidhansabha chunaav ke baad apana asli patta khol diya
 The power game is such that the NDA has two oldest friends face to face
 ye baat alag he ki maharashtra ke singhaasana ke saamne khadey nae gathbandhan par kai log sawalia nigaah lagaae baithe hai
 Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar's party has done the work of sprinkling salt on the wounds of the people burnt by the fire of inflation
 party ke mukhpatr rashtravaadi main logon ko chini naa khaane kii salaah di gai he
 When the Minister of Agriculture Sharad Pawar is on the target of the rising price of sugar, his party NCP mouthpiece Nationalist has reduced its limits
 sharad pavaar ke bachaav main mukhpatr ne jo salaah di he wo bhi kam jalaane vaali nahin
 The newspaper has written, 'there is no need to bring sugar under the Essential Commodities Act, because no one dies if the sugar is not eaten
 ulta shakkar khaane se diabetes hoti he or diabetes hone ke baad log chini chhod hi dete hai
 So there is no need for anyone to eat sugar '
 raajnneeti kaa takaza he so party to pavaar kaa bachaav karegi lekin wo logon ko aisi salaah dene lagegi ye logon ko hajam nahin ho rahaa
 On the other hand, the BJP engaged in encircling the ruling party on the issue of inflation, has questioned the advice of the NCP, what should people give up, the BJP said that the issue of not eating sugar in the NCP mouthpiece Nationalist is childish, and the Congress on this issue The NCP has also sought cleanliness from both

 This report of Seema Chishti of Indian Express has caused a shudder
 ham patrkaar is baat ko pehle se jaanate the, lekin kisi patrkaar kaa whatsap kol koi kyon sunanaa chahega, iskaa jawaab aage duungaa

 Because the people who have received the call from whatsapp, it has been told that your government is keeping an eye on your phone
 is company kii eemaandaaree or saahas dekhie
 If there was a company in India, it would have given all the data and also praised the government
 aakhir jab indian express ne grih sachiv or telecom sachiv se email ke zarie jawaab maanga to koi jawaab nahin diya gaya
 Reactions are coming when the news is public

 The camera of the phone turns on and starts to know where you are going, whom you are meeting and what you are talking about

 If journalists' phones start being tapped in this way, the remaining salt is equal to journalism, that too will be eliminated
 hamaare peshey main yah zaruri he ki ham apane sorce se hone vaali baatcheet ko gupt rakhen
 If someone will track the phone, they will not talk about the source and thus information will not reach you
 darane vaala patrkaar dar jayega
 You will be sold the story of terror or treason, but the intention behind it will be something else
 isliye patrkaar kaa phone tap hona behad gambhir maamla he

 team india ke captain viraat kohli ne dakshin africa ke khilaaf 34waan vanade shatak lagane ke saath hi apane vanade kariyar kii duusari best pari bhi kheli he
 Kohli played his best innings of 183 runs against Pakistan in the year 2012
 dakshin africa ko 124 ran se raundkar chah maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 3-0 kii ajey badhat banane ke baad team india ke captain ne kaha ki 30 over ke baad halaat kaaphi badal gaye or es main ek ballebaaj kaa ant tak krij par date rahanaa mahatvapurn tha
 Kohli scored an unbeaten 160 off 159 balls with 12 fours and two sixes, besides opening 140 for the second wicket with opener Shikhar Dhawan (76) and 7 for the seventh wicket with Bhuvneshwar Kumar (16 not out)
 2 over main 67 ran kii atoot saajhedaari kii
 This led to a big score of 303 for six wickets
 dakshin africa kii team iske jawaab main yujavendra chahal (46 ran par chaar wicket), kuldeep yadav (23 ran par chaar wicket) or jasprit bumraah (32 ran par do wicket) kii umdaa gendbaaji ke saamne 40 over main 179 ran par dher ho gai
 Kohli said after the match that the start of the tour was not good enough for us, but i knew that i would have to stick to the competition in every match
 kaaphi acha lag rahaa he ki main jeet main yogadan de rahaa hum
 He said that initially he could play good shots, but after 30 overs the situation changed a lot and we immediately reduced our target from 330 to 280-290
 aap hameshaa chaahate ho ki koi ant tak ballebaaji kare or agar aap captain ke rup main aisa karte ho to yah behtareen he
 He said that there was another good partnership with Shikhar and finally a good partnership with Bhuvi as well
 pari ke ant main pairon main jakadan thi lekin mujhe pataa tha ki 300 ran banane ke liye mujhe ant tak khelnaa hoga
 This is the time when you have a mental and physical examination
 baad main gendbaaji karte hue spinneron ke achche pradarshan par unhone kaha ki ham unhen lakshya kaa bachaav karne kaa dabaav dena chaahate the or yah kaaphi acha rahaa
 In the fourth match, the spirit will be better because now we can not lose this series
 mujhe yakeen he ki ve majboot vaapasi karne kii koshish karenge
 On the other hand, South African acting captain Eden Markram said that everything was disappointing for him in the match
 unhone kaha ki is match main hamaare liye sab kuch niraashajanak rahaa
 Once again he could not perform as expected
 hamen khud ko hi doshi tehraana hoga or kadi mehnat kerani hogi
 We were able to come back and stop them at a score of 303 which i think could have been achieved
 markeram ne kaha ki durbhagyapurna he ki ham kadi takkar nahin de paae or aise main aap is tarah kaa match nahin jeet sakate
 We once again faced them (spinners) and even after this time, if we are struggling to face them then it shows their level

 i think this will increase the confidence of the players

 Now this meeting will be held in Agra instead of Haridwar
 pichley ek maheene se haridwar main party ke netaa baithak kii taiyaariyon ko antim rup dene lage the lekin achaanak baithak kii jagah badal di gai
 There are several political aspects behind this decision
 sapa ke ek pradesh sachiv bataate hai ki pichley dinon party ke rashtriya mahasachiv ramgopal yadav lakhanu aakar mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or party ke duusare bade netaaon se mili the or tay kiya tha ki pashchimi upi kii loksabhaa siton par zyada dhyaan diya jaae
 The biggest reason for this is that there is a significant number of Muslim population in about 30 seats in western UP

 He bowled 131 consecutive balls
 match khatm hone ke samay baapu nadkarni kaa gendbaaji vivaran tha kuch yun tha-: 29 over, 26 madan, teen ran or koi wicket nahin

 In the case of overs, Nadkarni and in the case of ball, this record is named after South African off-spinner Hugh Teyfield

 unhone kaha, 'european union se baahar aana to ranneeti kaa ek hissaa he
 If we really want to cut immigration, then we have to consider all sources of immigration
 hamen kaam or padhai ke liye aane waalon par bhi vichaar karnaa hoga
 Under this, the tests taken by companies can be hardened before hiring people from abroad
 ' The objective of this test will be that people coming from abroad to meet the labor shortage in the labor market here, not to take away the jobs of British citizens
 nayaa kanoon kaaphi sakht hoga or isse iyu ke baahar ke deshon jaise bharat se peshewaron ko naukari dene vaali companiyon ko aisa karne main kathinaayee pesh aegi
 The comments red ne kaha, 'agar ham apane logon kii kaaryakshmata ko nahin badha sakate to ham duniya nahin jeet sakate
 In addition, he announced that from December it would be considered a crime to give a house or property on rent to immigrants who have no right to live in Britain
 is maamle main sampatti ke maalik ke khilaaf kanoonee karrwai kii ja sakegi
 Immigration check will also be required for those who want to drive a taxi here
 agle saal se bank bhi niyamit jaanch karenge ki kahin unhone bhi apni jaruri banking sevaaon main avaidh rup se rah rahe logon ko to naukari par nahin rakhaa he
 This immigration policy of Britain will also affect those people in India who are dreaming of going there

 Rudd said, "if we cannot increase the efficiency of our people, we cannot win the world
" ' iske alaava unhone ghoshnaa kii ki disambar se aise apravasiyon ko kiraye par ghar yaa sampatti dena aparaadh mana jayega, jinhen britain main rahane kaa koi haq nahin he
 In this case legal action can be taken against the owner of the property
 jo log yahaan taxi chalaanaa chaahate hai unke liye bhi avrajan jaanch jaruri hogi
 From next year, banks will also regularly check whether they have hired people living illegally in their essential banking services
 britain kii is avrajan niti kaa asar bharat main un logon par bhi padegaa, jo vahaan jaakar padhane kaa sapana paal rahe hai
 By the way, the number of Indians studying in Britain is currently the lowest in history
 agle saal se bank bhi niyamit jaanch karenge ki kahin unhone bhi apni jaruri banking sevaaon main avaidh rup se rah rahe logon ko to naukari par nahin rakhaa he
 This immigration policy of Britain will also affect those people in India who are dreaming of going there
 vaise bhi britain main padhane vaale bharatiyon kii sankhya is samay itihaas main sabase kam he

 Ganesha idols have become expensive by one and a half times due to GST
 kapade par paanch fisadi, color par 18 or saundarya saamagree par 28 fisadi tak GST lag jane kii vajah se murtiyon ke daam main ijapha ho gaya he
 Due to this, the business of idols has cooled down
 maharashtra ke baad chhattisgarh aisa rajya he jahaan ghar-ghar main ganesh pratimaayein sthapit kii jaati hai
 The Ganesh Utsav is about to come, but the artisans are sitting hand in hand as there is a tota of customers
 murtikaron ke mutabik no profit no los main ganesh pratimaayein muhaiyaa karaaye jane ke baavjood bhakt use kharidne kii himmat nahin juta paa rahe hai
 Sculptors' habitation Veeran Chattisgarh has sculptors sitting vacant in Mana Basti, famous for the business of idols
 kaarigaron ke paas kaam nahin he
 On the other hand, there is desolation in the considered settlement
 dur-dur tak graahakon kaa pataa nahin he
 Generally, a month before the festival of Ganesha, there used to be an influx of people booking idols in this area
 lekindghshwane aisi phija badali he ki kaarobaar thapp pad gaya he
 The devotees come and go, but on hearing the value of the idols, it becomes nine to eleven
 karigar bhi kya karen
 Therefore, GST has been imposed on the raw materials used for making idols, which have become expensive
 iske chalate tamaam chijen mahangi ho gai hai
 This has also made a difference in the prices of idols
 jo murtiyon GST lagu hone ke pehle 21 sau rupee kii aati thi, wo ab sidhe 36 sau rupee kii ho gai hai
 Not only this, the price of small idols has also increased by 35 to 40 percent
 murtikar kehete hai ki unhone murtiyon ke daam main koi ijapha nahin kiya he, lekin use banane vaale saamagree ke daam main badhotaree ho jane se murtiyon kii keemten badi hai
 Difficult to extract cost price According to Sadanand Rana, all the materials used to make the idol are GST
 zyaadaatar maal bahari rajyon se aata he
 Not only this, artisans go to metros to buy goods according to their own
 aise main murtiyon ke daam badhanaa swaabhaavik he
 Renuka Devi, the state's famous sculptor, fears that the festive glow will fade this time due to the dominance of GST in Ganesh and Durga festival
 unke mutabik aam istemaal main hone vaali vasteen mahangi hone se murtikla kaa kaarobaar thapp pad gaya he
 Devotees are not even willing to pay the actual price of the idol
 aise main unhen laagat mulya nikaalane main kathinaayee ho rahi he
 The sculptors have to wait for the devotees to keep their prices high, so the sculptors have also reduced the size of the Ganesha idols so that the consumption of materials is reduced and the prices are more or less such that the Ganesha ji is readily available to the common devotees
 rajya main 10 hajaar se zyada kaarigaron kaa parivaar sirf murti kala par nirbhar he
 Sculptures are made in the Mana township of Raipur throughout the year
 yahaan se ganesh ji, durga ji or kaali ji kii murtiyon rajya ke padosi pradeshon main bhi bheji jaati hai, lekin is baar maharashtra, pashchim bengal, madhya pradesh or jharkhand se pehle kii tulana main murtikaron ko order nahin mili hai
 There was never any recession in the sculptures business before the introduction of GST
 tyohaar aate-aate tamaam murtiyon haathon haath bik jaati hai
 Not only this, the sculptors get so many booking orders that they are able to provide the idols to the devotees with great difficulty, but this is the first time that the sculptors are looking for the devotees
 petrol ordijalki keemton main jari badhotaree par buudhvaar ko viraam lag gaya he
 There has been no change in the prices of petrol and diesel on Wednesday
 iske baad mumbai main ek litre petrol 90
 Remains at Rs 22 per liter
 dijal yahaan par 78
 69 per liter

 chennai main iske liye aapako 86
 13 per liter
 kolkata main ek litre petrol 84
 68 per liter
 dijalki keemton main bhi koi badlaav nahin hua he
 Due to this, the price of one liter diesel in Delhi was 74 today
 12 rupee prati litre kaa mil rahaa he
 78 in Chennai
 36 or kolkata main yah 75
 97 per liter
 bataa den ki mangalvaar copetrol or dijalki keemten record str par pahunch gai hai
 On Tuesday, people were paying more than Rs 91 for a liter of petrol in many cities of Maharashtra
 pichley maheene agast se lagaataar petrol or dijal kii keemton main badhotaree jari he
 This situation has arisen due to the rise in international crude oil prices
 iske alaava girte rupee ne bhi musiibat badhaai he
 In 2017, party president Amit Shah set a target of Mission 117 at the bjp's national executive in Bhubaneswar
 yah lakshya tha bengal, odisha or kerala sahit un samudratati rajyon kii 117 siton par jeet sunishchit karnaa jahaan bhaajapa kamjor thi
 In order to materialize the scheme, a large force of activists was deployed in these states and party president Amit Shah himself went to these states and held meetings, took out padyatras and held public meetings with party officials
 kerala main aresas kaaryakartaaon kii hatya ko lekar aakraamak rukh apanaate hue bhaajapa ne rajya kii left sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshan kaa lanbaa silsilaa chalaaya
 All the senior leaders of the party including party president Amit Shah were removed in the padyatra
 lekin jab sthaneey str par left kii taraf se virodh tej hua to bhaajapa ne apana kaarykram samaapt kar diya
 Later, the party again tightened its stand on Sabarimala but as the Lok Sabha elections came closer, the aggression of the party kept on going into Kerala
 party vahaan majboot sthiti main chunaav ladati nahin dikh rahi he
 The party had landed in Kerala with the hope that it would make a mark as the main opposition party leaving the Congress behind, but this plan of the party could not be achieved in this election
 bengal ke maamle main party ne kerala kaa hi formula apanaaya
 In the 2016 assembly elections, the BJP tried to challenge the TMC in a big way here
 mamata kii raily main bhaajapa ke kaaryakartaaon ne kaale jhande dikhaae or ugr virodh bhi kiya
 But the party did not get any major success here
 left yahaan jarur tisare number par chalaa gaya lekin bhaajapa koi kamaal nahin dikhaa saki
 Congress became the number two party here
 iske baad pichley saal hue panchayat chunaav ke dauraan bhaajapa ne apana prabhaav dikhaane main safalataa hasil kii or loksabhaa chunaav se pehle tiemasi ko chunauti dene kii sthiti main aa gai
 In view of this favorable situation, BJP launched an aggressive election campaign here
 pradhanmantri modi or party adhyaksh amit shah ne yahaan thok ke bhav main jansabhaayen kin
 Shah and his party stalwarts claimed 23 seats in the state
 bhaajapa ke is aakraamak rukh ko dekhte hue mamata banerjee ne bhi apane rukh ko aakraamak kar liya or pradhanmantri par tikhe hamale karne shuru kar die
 Shah had to cancel his roadshow after a violent incident at Amit Shah's roadshow on Monday
 bhaajapa ne virodh main bengal kii jagah dilli ke jantar-mantar par kolkata kii ghatana ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya
 The BJP also reached the Election Commission with a complaint
 kolkata main tiemasi yah sandesh dene main safal rahi ki bhaajapa ke logon ne ishwarchandra vidyasagar kii 200 saal puraani pratimaa ko tod diya
 He made yesterday's violence an issue of Bengali pride
 is siyaasi daanv main funsane ke baad bhaajapa ne aakhri charan se pehle bengal kaa aakraamak chunaav abhiyaan ko naram karne kaa faisla liya he
 Overall, the Bengal campaign of the BJP seems to be going in the same direction before the last phase of the election in which the bjp's campaign in Kerala went

 rajya main pehali baar ho rahe fest ke aayojak foundation ke vaais president deepak aroda bataate hai, ''is pahal kaa shrey un kuch yuvaaon ko jaataa he jinhen maine baat karte suna tha
 They had studied till the twelfth and were regretting not doing anything beyond it

 "such a small number of people from Bastar area have passed any professional or civil service examination that their names can be counted on their fingers
" kariyar fest main ilaake ke aise hi kuch safal log bhi maujuud the or chaatro ko maargdarshan de rahe the
 Here, a helpline was also launched to guide the careers of students living in remote areas
 jila colector anbalagan ne bharosa dilaayaa ki yah fest pehla or aakhri sabit nahin hoga balki ise taarkik ant tak pahunchaaya jayega
 He says, "we are preparing a database of students

 com / 4rsqt2xikp According to the Delhi Metro, the Metro service towards Huda City Center has been disrupted after this incident
 isaki vajah se aam yatriyon ko khaasi dikkat ho rahi he
 Significantly, this is not the first incident of trying to commit suicide in front of the metro
 isse pehle aisa hi ek maamla pichley saal aayaa tha
 Troubled and frustrated by his wife's illicit relations, a senior citizen committed suicide by jumping in front of the Delhi Metro train
 ghatana jitibi nagar metro stesan kii thi
 During that time, the police had told that at 3:20 pm, a senior citizen jumped on the platform number one of the train in front of the train
 mritak kii pahchaan 60 varshiya banarsi das ke rup kii gai thi
 a senior police officer had told that Banarasi Das, a resident of Adarsh nagar, was taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital, where he died
 mohan bhagwat ne kaha, ‘‘ek saal pehle maine swayan kaha tha ki dhairya rakhen
 Now i am saying that patience will not work
 ab hamen logon ko ekajute karne kii jarurat he
 Now we should demand the law
 '' bhagwat ne kaha, ‘‘chaahe jo bhi kaaran ho kyonki adaalat ke paas samay nahin he yaa ram mandir maamla unki praathamikta main nahin he athwa sambhavat: vah samaaj kii samvedansheeltaa ko nahin samaj paa rahi he
 In such a situation, the government should consider how a law should be brought for the construction of the temple
 
 
 kanoon jald se jald laayaa janaa chahie
 "he said," Now this is the decisive phase of the movement
 isse pehle ayodhya pahuncheshiv sena pramukhuddhav thakare(uddhav Thackeray) ne kaha tha ki centre sarkaar ke paas puraa adhikaar he ki vah is baar ram mandir kaa nirmaan karaae
 If she does not do so, i can tell you with a claim that this government will not be formed again
 VIDEO: dharm sansad ko lekar kile main tabdeel hua ayodhya
 Six people, accused of beating a dairy farmer in Haryana, beheaded in 2017, were acquitted by the court
 alvar kii apper jila or satr nyaayadhish sarita swami ne 14 agast ko apane faisle main police jaanch kii laaparvaahiyaan ginate hue us par sawaal uthaae
 Defense counsel told reporters that the police had left 'many flaws', one of which was that the video identifying the accused was not sent for forensic investigation
 disambar, 2018 main bhaajapa kii jagah satta sanbhaalane vaali congress sarkaar ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ne khaamiyon kii jaanch or sudhaar ke liye vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) gathit kar diya he
 Khan's son Irshad said that his family was shocked but he would definitely take the case to the upper courts
 gahalot sarkaar ne faisle ke khilaaf apil karne kaa sanket bhi diya he
 However, no one watching the investigation was surprised by the court's sharp criticism of the police's efforts
 shuruyaat se hi rajnatik lobbiyaan, dabaav samooh or activist police kii jaanch par kadi najar rakhe hue the
 a simultaneous investigation was initiated into the cases of molestation of Khan and possibly smuggling of cows at his hands
 khan ne jaisaa bataaya tha, unhen kareeb 200 logon kii bheed ne jaipur-dilli hive par rajasthan ke bahrod ke najadik 1 april, 2017 ko roak liya tha or unki pitayee kii thi
 According to Khan, he was returning to his hometown with a legally purchased cattle from a fair
 unki beraham pitayee main shaamil jo log video main dekhe gaye, unamem kathith taur par 19 varshiya 'chaatr netaa' vipin yadav bhi tha
 His name was not mentioned in the original First Information Report (FIR)
 isi exiar main khan ne, jo aspataal main bhartee or lahooluhaan the, bheed main shaamil chah logon ke naam bataae
 Based on cellphone data, the police gave them a clean chit in September 2017, stating that all six people were not present at the scene
 jaanch karne vaale pulicekarmiyon ne media ke saamne hairaani jataai thi ki khan ke liye vah ilaaka janaa-pahachaanaa nahin tha, aise main unhone chah logon ke naam kaise liye
 However, the chargesheet was filed against those whom Khan had named
 police ne khan ke khilaaf bhi aarope daayar kiye, kyonki unhen iske koi saboot nahin mili ki unke trek main mili maveshi unhone kharide the
 Khan's son claims that the purchase papers of the cattle were also vandalized by the alleged cow guards
 marpet ke do din baad aspataal main bhartee khan ne doctoron se poocha ki kya ve ghar ja sakate hai
 The doctors refused
 kuch ghanton baad khan kii maut ho gai
 The doctors said that he had a heart attack and on April 1, 2017, he was taken to a specialist doctor of heart
 par autopsi report main maut kaa kaaran tuuti hui pasaliyon se andruni taur par bahut zyada khun kaa bahna bataaya gaya; unki fefdon or seene kii mansapeshiyaan bhi tut-foot gai thim
 There was chaos across the country over Khan's death and there was pressure on the police to apprehend the culprits
 shuruaati jaanch main shaamil ek police afasar ne yahaan tak daawa kiya ki 'vampanthi kaaryakartaaon' ne khan ko bhaajapa or aresas ke najadik maane jane vaale sthaneey gorakshakon ko namjad karne kii 'pattee padhai' hogi
 It was also speculated that a police officer added these six names to the plain paper signed by Khan
 adaalat ne kaha ki police yah pataa lagane kii jaraa bhi koshish karti nahin dikhaai di ki ye chah naam exiar main kaise aae
 In October 2017, the names of nine people, including Yadav and three minors, were put in a new FIR
 unki pahchaan ghatnasthal ke cellphone footage ke aadhaar par kii gai
 The court judge of Alwar said that there were so many stains on this footage that it does not fully prove that the accused person was the one who beat Khan
 jaj ne ek tivi patrkaar kaa vah gopneey video bhi saboot ke taur par sweekaar karne se manaa kar diya, jisamen yadav ne kathith taur par ghatana main apane shaamil hone kii ding haanki thi
 At the same time, the owner of the mobile phone from which the video of the incident was made, was not produced in the court
 adaalat ke saamne yah baat bhi saaf nahin hui ki mobile phone ke footage ko satyaapan ke liye forensik lab ko bheja gaya yaa nahin
 The court was also skeptical about the police process, especially when neither a parade was conducted to identify the new accused nor Irshad could identify the accused in the court
 yahi nahin, police ne kaha ki pichley sitambar main adaalat aate vakt irshaad or unke saathiyon ke upar goli chalaae jane kaa koi saboot nahin tha
 Most of the blame is being put on the investigation officers because they could not present a strong case in the court
 jaahir he, khan ke parivaar kii insaaf kii aas ab esaity ke bharose he
 The Modi government, inaugurating the Mudra scheme in April 2015, distributed easy loans worth millions of crores to start small and medium businesses across the country
 is karj ko baantne ke peeche sarkaar kii manshaa kaarobaar ko boost dene ke saath-saath desh main rojgaar ke nae sansaadhan paidaa karnaa tha
 But this scheme, which has been running for three years, has now given sleep to the government
 kendra sarkaar ko dar he ki mudra yojana se bhi kahin desh main bainkon kaa enpie na bad jaae or bainkon ko ubaarane kii uski koshishen dhari kii dhari rah jaaen
 Under the Mudra scheme, the central government has done a loan of about 5 lakh crore rupees during three years
 media main chhapi kuch khabaron main daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki mudra yojana ke tahat die gaye in karjon main enpie teji se badhate hue 14 hajaar karod rupee ke aankade ko paar kar chukaa he
 However, this claim of NPA amount by a Hindi newspaper has not been confirmed by the finance ministry or banking system
 vahiin sarkaar ke aankadon ke mutabik vitt varsh 2017-18 ke dauraan pradhanmantri mudra yojana ke tahat kul 1
 a loan of Rs 81 lakh crore was sanctioned of which 1
 75 lakh karod rupee kaa karj de diya gaya
 However, for this financial year, the central government has a total of 2
 44 lakh karod rupee kaa karj aavanton kaa laksh rakhaa tha
 At the same time, this target is just 1 in the financial year 2016-17
 80 lakh karod rupee tha
 Read this: Now the fraud in the Prime Minister's Mudra Scheme, then the PNB, is under attack that Prime Minister Modi started the Mudra Yojana on 8 April 2015 and there is a provision in three categories of loans under this scheme
 pehla, shishu karj (50,000 rupee tak), doosraa, kishor karj (50,000 se 5 lakh rupee tak) or teesraa tarun karj (5 lakh se 10 lakh rupee tak)
 Under this scheme, there is a provision to provide loans for micro, small and medium businesses without collateral security
 is tarah ke karj ko badhaava dene ke peeche kendra sarkaar kii manshaa desh main zyada se zyada rojgaar ke nae sanshaadhan khadey karne kii he
 The loan of this central government pilot scheme is given through government banks, non-banking financial institutions and micro finance institutions in the country
 kendra sarkaar ke aankadon ke dekhen to vitt varsh 2017-18 ke dauraan kul 4,03,89,854 logon ko mudra karj diya gaya
 According to the provision of the scheme, up to 75 percent of this loan has been given to women and up to 50 percent of the money loan has been given to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes
 jaankaron kaa daawa he ki mudra yojana ke ye praavdhaan karj kaa risk factor badha dete hai
 At the same time some banking-related experts claim that once a person is given a loan under the Mudra scheme, refinancing for his venture is negligible, due to which the initial loss in front of the borrowers of the Mudra loan is to stand again
 There is a problem of refinancing
 vahiin mudra yojana ke tahat sabhi karj dene kaa kaam sarkari bainkon ko hi karnaa he jo pehle se hi enpie kii gambhir samasya main fanse hue hai
 It is worth noting that the Central Government has recently taken 2 steps to revive public sector banks from the NPA
 11 lakh karod rupee kaa ricapiteligeshan masauda taiyaar kiya he jisase bank apane nae karj aavanton main risk ko kam kar saken
 However, under the Mudra scheme, the central government has kept constant pressure on the banks to meet the central government's target of Mudra loan on time
 lihaaja, in paristhitiyon main sawaal khadaa hota he ki kya mudra yojana ne bainkon ke saamne dohari chunauti khadi kar di he
 On the one hand, he is trying to improve his NPA by taking a package from the government, on the other hand he is clearing the way to increase his NPA by giving unsecured loan of Mudra Yojana under the pressure of the government
