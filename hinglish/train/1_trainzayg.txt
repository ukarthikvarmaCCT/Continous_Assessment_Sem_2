 The Delhi Police has arrested a vicious thief who adopted such a method of stealing that the police were sweated to reach him
 chor pehle website par farji acount banaakar, logon se bike-skuti kharidne ke liye kharidaar banakar kisi pate par bulaata phir test drive ke bahaane lekar nau do gayaarah ho jaataa

 ' ek paisanger train ke do dibbon main bhartiya rigerv bank ke 342 karod rupee 226 alag-alag box main rakhe the
 Both boxes were fully reserved and were accompanied by 18 policemen
 raat ke andhere main kareeb 70 kilometre kii speed se train chali ja rahi thi
 It reaches 140 km in two hours at the station
 ye stesan khaas he kyonki isi stesan se train se dijal ingine ko alag hona he or uski jagah elactric ingine laganaa he
 The engine changes, and the train then starts moving at its own pace
 magar paanch ghante baad jab agle stesan par train rukati he to pataa chalata he ki raste main kisi ne chaar box se kareeb paanch karod rupye lut liye
 You must have seen many such scenes in film style lootfilms
 chalati train mendakaitiya lutpaat par desh-videsh main anginat filmein bani hai
 Seeing the scenes of those films made on The Great Train Robbery, many times your color will also have cropped up
 par aesefilmi sinahakeekat main bhi badal sakate hai shaayad hi kisi ne sochaa ho
 The robbery shocked everyone, after the incident, the crowd, police, bank officers were all surprised
 sabhi hairat main the, ye sochakar or ye dekh kar ki kya is tarah bhi train main robery ho sakati he? train kii bogi ke chat par suraakh kar lutere bogi ke andar jate hai, or vahaan se kareeb paanch karod rupee le udate hai
 And all this happens in a moving train
 lut vaale bogi main ek bhi pulisavaala nahintamilnadu ke selem se chali paisanger train kii jin do bogi main ye 342 karod rupee the, un donon bogiyon kii hifaazat ke liye 18 pulisavaale the
 There was also an Assistant Commissioner
 suraksha kii jimmedaari railway police force kii thi
 15 of whose soldiers were walking with the train
 magar jis bogi main daaka padaa, uske andar koi pulisavaala nahin tha
 The bogie was sealed and the security personnel were seated in another bogie, which held the rest of the money
 jaise hi ye train agnor railway stesan par pahunchati he, tab pehali baar ek railway karmchaaree kii najar is bogi ke chat par padati he
 There was hole in the roof
 train main daaka pad chukaa tha, kyonki ye un do main se hi ek bogi thi, jisamen bhartiya rigerv bank ke 342 karod rupee rakhe the
 Now the question was, how was the robbery in the moving train? Where was it? And who are those vicious people who rob? Who can be? Before reaching Surakchennai on the roof of the bogey, this robbery in the train may not have been revealed
 wo to train jab selem se agnor railway stesan pahanchi to pulisavaalon ne bogi kaa darwaja kholkar yun hi andar kaa muyna karne lage
 And at the same time, an officer felt very strange when he saw that even in the darkness of night, there was strong light coming from outside inside the bogie
 isi ke baad jab ek railway karmchaaree ko bogi kii chat par bheja gaya to pataa chalaa ki chat main send maari ja chuki he
 Actually, the iron roof of the bogie was cut from a welding or gas machine
 chodai itani thi ki ek aadmi aasaana se us sooraakh se bogi ke andar aa ja saktaa tha
 As soon as this was realized the security forces were shocked
 5 karod rupee lekar faraaraisi ke baad jab bogi main rakhe bakse kii talaashi lee gai to pataa chalaa ki us bogi main rakhe kul chaar box aise the, jinke saath chhedchhad kii gai he
 One of them was completely empty
 jabaki baaki box se kuch note nikaale gaye the
 Later, when all the boxes were counted, it was found that about five crore rupees were missing
 yani lutere apane saath paanch karod rupee le gaye
 Most of the notes kept in boxes were of thousand, five hundred and hundred
 train main daaka pad chukaa tha ab ye pataa lagaana tha ki aakhir ye hua kaise? to chaanbin ke baad jaanch team philhal isi nattejey par pahunchi he ki train main lut selem se viradhachalam ke bich hi hui he
 Because the train runs with a diesel engine on this 140-km track between Salem to Virdhachalam
 aise main train kii chat par chadh kar chat ko kaatna aasaan tha
 While on the electrified route it is not possible to climb on the roof of the train under the high tension wire and make a dent in the roof
 isse karant lagane kaa khatra tha
 However, another theory is also coming that when the train stopped for an hour at Virdhachalam station to convert from diesel engine to electric engine, there may be a robbery there
 haalanki police kaa maananaa he ki isaki sambhaavna kam he, kyonki stesan par train ke khadi hone kii surat main chat par chadh kar send lagaana behad riski kaam he
 All the robbed notes The old police believe that behind this robbery a person may also be responsible
 jise pataa tha ki kis train se kis bogi main rupee ja rahe hai
 The police is also not denying that any North Indian gang is behind this robbery
 haalanki police kaa ye bhi kahana he ki luute gaye saare rupee 2005 se pehle ke hai or bahut se rupee kii haalat to behad kharaab he
 There are torn notes
 isliye lut ke baad bhi luteron ke liye wo rupee bazaar main chalaanaa itnaa aasaan nahin hoga

 India won the toss in this historic 2000th Test and the 100th Test match being played between the two teams and invited England to bat first
 jahir khan mansapeshiyon main khinchaav hone ke kaaran bich main maidan chhodane se pehle elistare cook (12) or straas (22) ko out kiya, lekin jonathan traat (naabad 58) england ke bachaav main utre
 His innings helped England to 127 for two on the rain-affected first day
 traat ke saath duusare chor par kevin petersan 22 ran banaakar khel rahe hai
 Both of them tried to name England to a great extent on the first day by adding 65 runs for the third wicket so far
 subah halki barish ke kaaran khel aadha ghanta der se shuru hua
 Due to bad light, tea was taken a little earlier but after that the rain came and then there was no further play in the day
 shaam ko saadhe chah baje khel shuru hone kii sambhaavna bani lekin tabhi barish aa gayi jiske baad ampiron ne din kaa khel samaapt karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 The first day of this historic match at Lord's was a surprise Zaheer and Trott
 jahir ne ab tak 13
 Took two wickets for 18 runs in 3 overs, while Trott, playing the first match against India, is seen moving towards the big score after getting two lives
 jahir ko chhodkar bharat kaa koi bhi anya gendbaaj prabhaavshaalee pradarshan nahin kar paaya
 Zaheer also went to the dressing room due to cramps in the 42nd over of the innings
 subah se hi aasmaan main badal ghire the, isliye mahendra singh dhoni ne tas jitkar pehle kshetrarakshan kaa faisla kiya
 Strauss and Cook started cautiously
 pehle teen over madan gayi or shrinkhalaa kaa pehla ran chauke ke rup main aayaa
 Cook then cut Praveen and sent it to the boundary line
 behtareen farm main chal rahe cook jald hi jahir ke shikaar ban gayi
 He was unable to understand his straight ball and was lbw to an attempt to flick it
 pichhali saat pariyon main yah pehla mauka tha jabaki cook ardhashatak tak pahunchane se pehle hi pavilion laut gayi
 Harbhajan was called for bowling in the 19th over

 Strauss played 290 balls before this match and five times he was a victim of Zaheer
 england ke captain ne pehle satr main unka datakar saamana kiya lekin duusare satr ke shuru main hi jahir unhen out karne main safal rahe
 Trott was successful in scoring his seventh Test half-century by taking advantage of the life he got initially
 jahir ne unhen bhi kaaphi pareshaan kiya
 When Trott was on 32, Zaheer took the edge of his bat and went for four runs between Dhoni and Dravid
 use kaich main tabdeel kiya ja saktaa tha
 Praveen in the West Indies was removed from bowling to run on the pitch and even today the umpire warned him on one occasion
 praveen or ishanth kii gandon main westeindies jaisaa movement nahin dikhaa
 Ishant troubled the batsmen on one or two occasions but Praveen failed to leave an impact

 bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi kaa kahana he ki hindu samhita main aise kai praavdhaan hai jo apraasangik hai or unhen sudhaarney kii jarurat he
 In an interview given to Urdu weekly 'new World', Modi said that the implementation of Uniform Civil Code does not mean that the Hindu Code will be enforced on all citizens of the country
 desh ke har naagarik par hindu samhita lagu nahin karenge: modimodi ne kaha, 'samvidhan kahata he ki sarkaar samaan naagarik samhita ko lagu karne kaa prayaas karegi
 Secondly i would like to clarify that the implementation of Uniform Civil Code does not mean that all citizens of the country will be brought under the Hindu Code
 ' modi ne intervyuu ke dauraan aage kaha, 'meraa maananaa he ki hindu samhita main anek praavdhaan hai jo apraasangik hai or unhen sudhaarney kii jarurat he
 In the 21st century, it is unnecessary to carry on 18th century laws
 'gauratlab he ki bijepi ne apane chunavi ghoshnaa patr main samaan naagarik samhita ko lagu karne ke bindu ko shaamil kiya he
 In an attempt to allay any fear among Muslims, Modi, during the interview, dismissed the possibility of ending the existing constitutional or statutory body for the welfare of the community
 unhone kaha ki vah in sansthaaon ko majboot karne ke liye kaam karenge
 Describing secularism as an imported concept from the West, Modi said that Congress used it to get the votes of Muslims and now Congress and other parties are using this community for vote bank
 bharat ke diene main sadbhaavna or sammanmodi ne aage kaha ki samvidhan ne sabhi nagarikon ko samaan adhikaar die hai or bharat ke diene main sabhi dharmon ke liye sadbhaavna or sammaan he
 When Modi was asked about his critics' fears about the closure of institutions like Minorities Commission, Minority Finance Development Corporation, he said, "constitutional and statutory bodies need to be strengthened
" unhen samaapt nahin karnaa he
 What is needed is to make them profitable and strong so that they do concrete work instead of running on the existing system of symbolic steps

 a Matrimonial Service Provider in Chandigarh was unable to find a qualified groom for the doctor daughter of a client
 chandigarh upabhokta forum ne wedding vish privet limited naam ke is metrimonial sarvice prowider ko client ko muaavje, kanoonee kharch or byaaj ke taur par 62,000 rupye dene kaa aadesh diya
 What is the whole matter, Surendra Pal Singh Chahal and his wife Narendra Kaur Chahal filed a complaint in Chandigarh Consumer Forum on 6 December 2018
 shikaayat main kaha gaya ki wo 2017 main apni doctor beti (haryana sarkaar ke saath medical afasar) ke liye yogya duulhaa talash rahe the
 Then Wedding Wish Private Limited approached him to offer his services
 chahal parivaar ke mutabik ladki ke mangalik hone kii vajah se metrimonial sarvice prowider se kaha gaya ki wo chandigarh or aasapaas ke jat samudaay ke doctor ladakon ke profile uplabdh karaaen jo mangalik hon
 The Chahal family says that 'wedding Wish' promised them that at least 18 of the above mentioned profiles of boys would be provided within 9 months from the date of service agreement
 royal package kii sadsyta ke liye die 50,000 rupechahal parivaar ne metrimonial agency ke saath 26 sitambar, 2017 ko sarvice agreement kiya or royal package kii sadsyta ke liye 50,000 rupye kaa bhugtan kiya
 In a complaint to the Consumer Forum, the Chahal family said that the profiles provided were neither as promised nor did we meet our needs
 shikayatakarta ke mutabik jab metrimonial form duulhon ke sahi profile uplabdh karaane main naakaam rahi to use ye chhot bhi de di gai ki chandigarh se 60 kilometre ke daayre main bhi duulhe kii talash kii ja sakati he
 Despite this, the matrimonial agency failed to provide a correct profile
 kaaphi samay bekaar hone ke baad chahal parivaar ne 'wedding vish' ko sarvice charge byaaj samet lautaane ke liye 22 oktober 2018 ko kanoonee notice bheja
 According to the Chahal family, Matrimonialfirm did not even bother to answer this notice
 isi ke baad chahal parivaar ko upabhokta forum kaa darwaja khatkhataana padaa

 Also, no timelines were promised to the client
 upabhokta forum ne donon pakshon kii daleelein sunne ke baad metrimonial agency ko client kaa samay barbaad karne kaa jimmedaar tehraaya
 Because not a single meeting could be held on behalf of the firm with any proposed groom of the client
 upabhokta forum ne apane aadesh main 'wedding vish' ko client ko 50,000 rupye sarvice charge 9% salanaa byaaj ke saath lautaane ke liye kaha
 Also asked to pay Rs 7000 compensation and Rs 5000 legal expenses to the client

 Sathe said that instead of eating food, Rajiv ate sweets especially Rasgulla and Marathi dish Puran Podi Chav and praised it a lot

 Once again, left organizations in the campus are contesting from the Left Unity panel
 beete kai saal se vam sanghathan ek saath milakar chunaav lard rahe hai
 But for the first time, AISA did not field its presidential candidate
 is baar esefai (student federation of india) panel main adhyaksh pad ke liye apana pratyaashee utaar rahi he
 Nai Balaji of AISA, who was elected as student union president last year, told Aaj Tak that AISA is ready to make every sacrifice to save the culture of JNU
 beete kai saalon se jeenyu campus main isa kaa bolbalaa rahaa he
 Before 2014, all the left organizations on campus used to contest elections by putting out different panels
 lekin, saal 2016 kii ghatana ke baad vam chaatr sanghathan ek saath aakar ek panel se chunaav ladate the
 In this panel too, AISA always fielded candidates for the post of president
 sutron kii maane to iske peeche sipiiem dwaara panel main ladane ke liye rakhi gai shart ko vajah bataaya ja rahaa he
 Let us tell that in the 2016-17 Students' Union election, the Left formed a panel and competed with ABVP
 ye wo daur tha jab farvari 2016 main campus main left sanghathanon par afjal guru par kaarykram yojit karne or desh virdohi naare lagane kaa aarope laga tha
 Then that year the Left formed the first subsequent panel
 isamen isa or esefai ek saath aae the
 Then both organizations fielded candidates for two seats each
 us panel main bhi isa adhyaksh pad par lard rahi thi
 The round came until 2017-18, even in the Modi government, the left panel in JNU could not stand up so strongly
 is saal panel main teen sanghathan ek saath aae, isamen isa, esefai or dsef the
 Aisa then had two seats
 phir 2018-19 main left unity chaar sanghathanon ke saath ladi
 It also came with AISF along with AISA, SFI, DSF
 is chunaav main isa ne sirf adhyaksh pad par chunaav ladaa tha lekin unka pratyaashee baari bahumat se jeeta
 Students 'union could not be notified
 Last year, even though the left panel won the JNU Students' Union elections, the administration never invited them to any important meeting
 ye hi nahin prashasan ne un par sahi hisaab na dene kii baat kahkar notiphoi tak nahin kiya tha
 Despite writing letters to the student union several times, he was not notified
 yahi nahin jis din jeenuasu chunaav ke parinaamon kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi, thik usee din campus main left sanghathan or abivipi ke bich kaaphi ghamaasan bhi hui thi
 Now whatever may be the reason, but mutual pulls in the left wing are now clearly visible
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki ye chunaav koun jeetta he, left unity se esefai ke ummidavaar utaarne kaa faisla kya rang laata he, haalanki isa or esefai donon hi sanghathan ye hi kah rahe hai ki left unity banane ke peeche sanghathan ke str par koi aisi baat nahin he
 Former JNU Students Union president Ensai Balaji says that AISA stands against the hanging ideology on campus, for this we are ready to sacrifice at any level
 aishi ghosh hai left unity kii adhyaksh pratyaashsaai ne adhyaksh pad ke liye aaishi ghosh ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 At the same time, there is DISF (democratic Student Federation) in the post of Vice President
 iske alaava AISA is baar mahasachiv pad ke liye daavedaari kar rahi he
 Then AISF (all India Student Federation) has fielded its candidate on Joint Secretary
 chunaav main kendriya panel ke chaar padon par 14 ummidavaar maidan main hai
 The central panel faces the Left Unity and ABVP in all four positions
 in donon sanghathanon ke alaava lalu yadav kii party argedy ke chaatr sanghathan chaatr rajd (siargedy) ne do padon par ummidavaar khadey kiye hai
 This time NSUI is contesting only the President without a panel
 birsa ambedkar phule students association (bapsa) ne do padon adhyaksh or mahasachiv pad par pratyaashee utaare hai
 Claim- Status of hospitals deteriorated after Ayushman scheme, they paid Rs 1600 crore from the rest of the private hospitals of the rest of the country to stop 'cashless' services under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) Be warned
 yah chetavanee privet aspataalon ke association ne di he kyonki kendriya vitt mantralay kii ore se unka 1600 karod kaa bhugtan lataka hua he
 The details of the dues of the hospitals were sent to the Finance Ministry through a letter in July, but no result was found
 ab aspataal is maamle par kadaa kadam uthaane ke bare main soch rahe hai, jisaki vajah se CGHS or ECHS jaisi yojanaayen prabhavit ho sakati hai
 The association claims that the situation has worsened after the Modi government implemented the Ayushman Bharat Universal Healthcare Scheme
 association of healthcare prowiders of india (AHPI) kii haal hi main hui baithak main tay kiya gaya ki agar centre sarkaar ne bakaayaa bilon ke bhugtan ko manjuuri nahin di to CGHS or ECHS labhaarthiyon ko di jane vaali 'cashles' seva band kar di jaaegi
 Association director general Girdhar Giani said, "the payment of hospitals has been hanging for the last three years as the number of hospitals under these schemes has increased while the budget for approving bills is as much as before
 "unhone kaha, "ayushmaan bharat yojana lagu hone ke baad sthiti or kharaab ho gai or bakaayaa raashi 1600 karod pahunch gai he
 "he said that" We are soon going to write a letter to the Ministry and the concerned authorities that if no emergency action is taken to compensate for our loss then we will be forced to discontinue the services provided under these schemes
 
 "july main vitt mantralay ko privet aspataalon kii ore se ek memorondom bheja gaya tha jiskaa koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 After this, now the hospitals have taken this decision
 association ne apane patr main mantralay se kaha tha ki lambey samay se bakaayaa bhugtan nahin hone kii vajah se ye yojanaayen labhaarthiyon or aspataalon ke liye bhi apana mahatv kho rahi hai
 Outstanding payment of hospitals is a major concern
 aspataalon ne CGHS yojana kii sharton ke aadhaar par agreement sin kiya tha, jo ki 1 oktober, 2014 se lagu hui
 The plan provides that 70 per cent of the bills that the hospital will impose will be paid within five working days
 kisi bhi maamle main is tarah nirdhaarit samay ke bheetar bhugtan nahin kiya gaya
 Hospitals have to wait for months to years for payment
 is vajah se aspataalon main asthirataa kii sthiti ban rahi he or aspataal laa bhaarthiyon kaa ilaaj karne se inkaar kar rahe hai
 The association warned in its letter that until the ministry releases a large amount, the arrears will remain in the same bracket
 association ne kaha, "agar aap lambey samay se latake is bakaayaa bhugtan par dhyaan dete hai to ham aapke abhaari honge
 This is causing osteoporosis in outstanding hospitals
 sarkaar kii flagship yojanaon jaise ayushmaan bharat par bhi iskaa bura asar pad rahaa he kyonki aspataal isi dar se un yojanaon ke tahat kaam karne ke liye aage nahin aa rahe hai ki samay se unka bhugtan nahin hoga
 "if the private hospitals execute this announcement, then 37 lakh beneficiaries of Central Government will be affected under CGHS and 52 lakh ex-servicemen under ECHS
 philhal in labhaarthiyon ko in yojanaon ke tahat 1000 aspataalon or nursing homes main sevaayen milti hai
 Among the hospitals that have the highest dues, Max Healthcare owes 150 crores and Fortis Group has 58 crores
 association ke ek padaadhikari ne kaha, "bakaayaa raashi ke bhugtan sambandhi samasya par pratikriya dete hue kendriya swasthya mantralay ne ek memo jari karke sabhi hitdharakon se CGHS yojana main sudhaar karne or ise pun rjeevit karne ke liye suzav maanga he
 But the Ministry of Health did not say a single word on our concerns

 Amit Shah may have met Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai to bridge the distance from Shiv Sena, but Shiv Sena does not seem to be in a mood to bridge this gap
 agle loksabhaa chunaavon main shivasena ke akele dam par chunaav ladane kii baat doharaate hue uddhav thakare ne elaan kiya he ki shrinivas vanagaa palghar loksabhaa kshetra se party ke ummidavaar honge
 Interestingly, Onega lost to BJP candidate Rajendra Gavite in the recently concluded Lok Sabha by-election
 shivasena ke 52wein sthapana diwas ke maukey par uddhav thakare ne party kaaryakartaaon se ghar-ghar jane ko kaha
 He told the workers, 'you people go from house to house and find out whether people are getting the benefits of Central and State Government schemes
 unhone (bijepi) sampark for samarthan abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii he, aap satya shodhan abhiyaan chalie
 Find out whether people are getting benefit of schemes or not
 'uddhav thakare ne kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue yah bhi kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav isi saal disambar main honge
 This election will not be held in april-may
 unhone kaaryakartaaon se apil karte hue kaha ki ve chunavi taiyaari main jute jaaen
 Uddhav Thackeray said that the next Chief Minister of the state would be from Shiv Sena
 uddhav thakare kaha, ' shivasena pradhanmantri narendra modi kii mumbai-ahmedabad ke bich chal rahi mahatvakankshi yojana bullate train kaa virodh karegi
 The party will also oppose the mumbai-vadodara Expressway
 kyonki in yojanaon se maharashtra se zyada gujarat ko laabh milegaa
 No one goes to Ahmedabad to work from Mumbai, but people from Ahmedabad come to Mumbai to work
 'shivasena ke ek aantarik sutara ne mail today se bataaya ki party maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav akele ladane ke mood main he, lekin vah loksabhaa chunaav bijepi ke saath hi ladegi, kyonki zyaadaatar saansadon kaa maananaa he ki bijepi ke saath rahane hi ve ekajute vipaksh ke saamne khadey ho paaenge
 Shiv Sena has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in farmer coma
 shivasena ne kaha ki bijepi kii fasal lahalha rahi he or desh kaa kisaan or uski kheti coma main ja chuki he, lekin modi sarkaar baar-baar jumalebaji karne main lagi hui he
 The Shiv Sena has targeted the BJP in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'saamana'
 party ne kaha ki jo garajte hai, wo barasate nahin
 This adage applies to existing incumbents
 unhone kaha ki asamiti ghoshnaaen or usee jumalebaji se ab desh kii janata pareshaan ho chuki he
 Shiv Sena said, 'prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to farmers across the country on Wednesday
 modi ne kaha ki 2022 tak kisaanon kii aamadani doguni karenge
 But the question is what is new in this
 2014 ke chunavi ghoshnaa patr main bhi bijepi ne kisaanon ko yahi aashwasan diya tha
 Sivasane said that farmers had relied on this assurance and had ousted the Congress from power and handed over power to the BJP
 maharashtra or centre main endie kii ghatak shivasena ne kaha ki bijepi kii fasal lahalha uthi jabaki desh kaa kisaan or uski kheti coma main chali gai he
 Shiv Sena questioned whether the farmers will have good days? The Prime Minister should have answered this, but will double the yield of farmers
 is tarah ke puraane aashwaasano kii casat bajaakar pradhanmantri mukt ho gaye
 The party said that the farmer is seeing his plight with open eyes
 is sarkaar ke shashan main kisaan kii upaj doguni to nahin hui, lekin kisaanon kii aatmahatyaayein doguni ho gai hai
 The Shiv Sena said that it is the banks that set the carpet for the big entrepreneurs who have chosen banks, but this government becomes crooked in ten places as soon as the demand for the farmers standing on the threshold of suicide is exempted, but many rules and laws are imposed and loan waiver Hangs up
 yah bhedbhaav he
 Shiv Sena said that since 2014, 40 thousand farmers have committed suicide in the country, Maharashtra is ahead in that too
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya kaa graph kyon bad rahaa he
 Not thinking of this, the Modi government is repeating the same words again and again

 For the last several elections, Alamgir has been waving the glory of victory

 Alamgir's unseasoned Rajsal had defeated Beniprasad Gupta of NBP in the 2000 assembly elections in Alamgir
 iske baad saal 2005 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ke alamgir kaa muqabla jeemem ke akil akhtar se hua tha or jinamein alamgir jeet darj karne main kaamyaab rahe
 After this, in the 2009 and 2014 assembly elections, there was a contest between Alamgir and Akil Akhtar, in which Alamgir was overwhelming

 Politicians are attacking each other in a subtle way

 This is a matter of concern for the country and it will not do any good to anyone, instead the country will go backward

 If we can dismiss these statements outright and condemn them instead of taking juice in them, then it will be good for the country

 bharat kii taraf se captain harjit singh (11wein minute) or mandeep singh (55wein minute) ne gol kiye, jabaki dakshin africa ke liye ekmaatr gol kyle line kachet (28wein minute) ne daaga
 India thus advanced to the quarter-finals with nine points from three wins in pool where they will face second-placed Spain from Pool c on Thursday

 Kyle Lyon Kacchet smacked Indian goalkeeper Vikas Dahiya and scored on it to equalize the score at 1-1

 ) Initially the match seemed one sided, as India took an aggressive approach which allowed South Africa to devote all its strength to saving the goal
 bharat ne lagaataar hamale kiye lekin pratidwandvi team ne bhi unke prayaason ko naakaam karne main kasar nahin chodi
 India were successful in the last minute in the 11th minute, while captain Harjeet scored a goal from Manpreet Jr's move from the left end
 bharat ne iske baad bhi dabaav banaae rakhaa or iske chah minute baad use apana pehla penlti corner mila lekin harmanpreet singh ke shaat ko dakshin africa golkeeper siyavuya nolushungu ne bachaa diya

 India maintained an aggressive attitude even after the intermission but missed a golden opportunity to score again in 45 minutes

 However, the trend seems to be only three days from the beginning
 somvaar ko 10 karod ke aas paas collection kaa anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa he
 While trade experts had estimated that the film would earn 20 crores
 shuukravaar ko relies hui film ne bhartiya bazaar main ummid se kaaphi kharaab shuruyaat kii thi
 20 on the first day of the film
 14 karod, duusare din 18
 22 crores, on the third day i
e
 only 20 on Sunday
 71 karod kamaaye the
 If the estimated figures of Monday are added, the film has so far managed to earn only 69 crores in India
 film pehle hafte main 100 karod kii ore bahut mushkil se bad rahi he
 Will Christmas benefit now? Now the eyes of the trade experts will be on the Christmas collection
 anumaanon kii maane to film is din pachchis karod yaa usase zyada kama sakati he
 However, the earnings trend has been very bad and it does not seem possible in view of that

 com / nk7oxdpvds maharashtra main phir bani BJP-SS sarkaarshivsena ne phir rakhi CM pad kii mangapichhali baar ensipi ne chali thi samarthan kii baazimaharashtra main bhartiya janata party or shivasena kii jodi ne ek baar phir bahumat hasil kar liya he
 Five years ago both parties contested separate elections, but this time both contested
 bijepi sabase badi party to banakar ubhari, lekin pichhali baar jaisaa chamatkaar nahin hui
 When the strength of the BJP has weakened, the Shiv Sena has increased its voice and has begun to look with eyes
 lekin kya bhaajapa shivasena ke aage jhukne ko taiyaar hogi, isapar har kisi kii najar he
 Or once again, a scene similar to five years ago, where the NCP killed the entry between the two
 nateezon ke baad shivasena ne dikhaaya damguuruuvaar ko aae nateezon ke baad jab shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare media ke saamne aae to unhone ek hi baat ko baar-baar doharaaya or kaha ki is baar 50-50 ke formule par aage badha jayega or kisi bhi tarah nahin jhukaa jayega
 At the same time, Devendra Fadnavis had also given a statement that what has been decided by the Shiv Sena will be the same as before
 maharashtra main kya kamjor hui he bhaajapa?shivasena kaa nateezon ke baad is tarah kaa aakraamak rukh apnaanaa isliye bhi saamne aa rahaa he kyonki bijepi kii siten is baar kam hui hai
 In 2014, the BJP, which contested on its own, won 122 seats, but this time BJP won only 105 seats
 haalanki, shivasena ne bhi is baar apni siten gavaayin hai or vah 63 ke aankade se 56 par aa gai he
 Shivsena or else will fight for the post of Chief Minister
 
 
 shivasena ne chunaav prachaar ke dauraan aditya thakare ko mukhyamantri banane kii maang kii thi, lekin jitani siten ai hai usase vah mumkin hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 But Shiv Sena is still adamant on the 50-50 formula
 aise main vah CM pad ke liye kya rukh karti he wo dekhne laayak hoga
 But it will not be so easy for Shiv Sena, because in 2014, when Shiv Sena refused to form a government with BJP, then NCP had taken a step forward to support BJP for a stable government
 jiske baad shivasena par dabaav bana or vah bijepi ke saath aa gai
 Now once again the situation is same, Shiv Sena is putting pressure on BJP
 lekin kya ensipi phir ek baar apana paanch saal puraani baaji chalegi
 By not focusing the benefits of # unionbudget2016 on the # suitboot people @arunjaitley has cleverly made the opposition's job a bit tougher
 If the Union Budget were like annual exams for PM Shri @narendramodi then i must say he has passed the exams with flying colours
 Earlier on Sunday, Modi had said in his radio program 'mann Ki Baat' on the radio that 'I too will give an exam tomorrow

 ' zamin adhigrahan bill par aam raay banane kii koshish main lagi sarkaar ne bill ke ek mahatvapurn praavdhaan par narmi ke sanket diye hai
 According to sources, the government has told the members of the Joint Committee of Parliament that in the Land Acquisition Act there is no need to take land under the Industrial Corridor
 sarkaar kii ore se kahi gai ye baat kaaphi mahatvapurn he kyonki maujuuda bill main sarkaar jo sanshodhan laa rahi he usamen industrial coridor ke liye hive ke donon ore ek kilometre zamin liye jane kaa prastaav he
 Now the question is whether this will loosen the provision? But it is not clear yet whether the government will withdraw the amendment brought on the law made in 2013? sutron ke mutabik hive auki rail jaise leniyar project ke donon ore zamin lene ke praavdhaan ko dhilaa kiya ja saktaa he yaa phir hataaya ja saktaa he
 In this bill, there has been continuous controversy over the amendments made under the ordinance
 sarkaar ke paas rajyasabha main bill ko paas karwaane ke liye bahumat nahin he
 Therefore, the government has to bring an ordinance on this bill again and again, due to which it has been criticized a lot
 sansad kii samiti ko 3 agast tak apni report deni he
 That is why the government is trying to settle the contentious issues
 usne rajyon ko bill ke praaroop ko banane auki muawza tay karne ke niyamon main puri chhot deni kii baat kahi he
 This thing is very important from the government, because the amendment that the government is bringing in the current bill, it is proposed to take one kilometer of land on both sides of the highway for the industrial corridor
 ab sawaal he ki kya is praavdhaan ko dhilaa karegi? lekin abhi ye saaf nahin he ki kya sarkaar 2013 main bane kanoon par laayaa gaya sanshodhan waapas legi?tippaniyan According to sources, the provision of taking land on both sides of the linear project such as highway and rail can be loosened or removed
 is bill main adhyadesh ke tahat kiye gayi sanshodhano ko lekar lagaataar vivaad ho rahaa he
 The government does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha to get the bill passed
 isaliye is bill par sarkaar ko baar-baar adhyadesh laana pad rahaa he jisase uski kaaphi aalochana hui he
 The Committee of Parliament has to submit its report by 3 August
 isaliye sarkaar vivaadit muddon par sulah karne kii koshish main he
 It has asked the states to give complete relaxation in the rules for drafting the bill and fixing compensation

 (input language) vinayak damodar saavarkar kaa naam swatantraaa sangram se jude un chand logon main shaamil he jinhen lekar tamaam tarah ke myth or kahaniyaan gadhi gai hai
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which to this day describes itself as representative of Savarkar's legacy, his relationship with Jeetji Savarkar was not as smooth as it is claimed
 aaj vinayak damodar saavarkar kii punyatithi par ham jaanane kii koshish karte hai ki aise koun-koun se mudde the jinpar sangh or saavarkar kaa rukh ek duusare ke vipareet rahaa
 The Sangh's refusal to become a youth unit of the Mahasabha, Vinodayak Damodar Savarkar, was the leader of the Hindu Mahasabha
 hindu mahasabha kii sthapana 1906 main muslim lig kii sthapana ke baad 1915 main hui thi
 The aim of which was to protect Hindu interests in British rule
 hindu mahasabha kii sthapana ke 10 saal baad rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii sthapana mahasabha ke kuch netaaon ne kii
 In this sense, the Hindu Mahasabha can also be called the mother organization of the Sangh
 mahasabha ke netaa chaahate the ki sangh unki yuva ikai ke taur par kaam kare
 But this plan of the Mahasabha could not be completed and under the leadership of Savarkar, Ram Sena, the youth unit of the Mahasabha was established
 congress ke khilaaf raajnneetik dal bananaa chaahate therashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko lekar walter ke
 The book 'the Brotherhood in Saffron, the RSS and the Hindu Revivalism' by Anderson and Sridhar Damle claimed that Savarkar wanted to turn the Hindu Mahasabha into a political party against the Congress
 jabaki aresas ke sansthaapak keshav baliram headgavar pehle se hi tay kar chuke the ki aresas congress ke khilaaf sakriy raajnneeti main sahabhaagi na hokar ek saskruthik sanghathan ke taur par kaam karegaa
 At one time differences between Savarkar and the Sangh had become so deep that Savarkar had instructed the Hindu Mahasabha workers to leave the Sangh
 iskaa zikr 3 march, 1943 ko saavarkar dwaara likhe ek patr ke madhyam se chalata he
 Quit India Movement The Quit India Movement of 1942 is recorded as an important stage in the pages of the history of independence
 jab britain dwitiya vishwa yuddh main shaamil ho rahaa tha or mahatma gandhi ne bharat chodo andolan kii aguwai kii
 During this time the whole country participated actively in this movement, but the RSS kept itself away from this movement
 lekin saavarkar ne ek kadam aage badhkar is dauraan desh ke anya hisson kaa daura kiya or hindu yuvaaon ko angrejon kii sena main shaamil hone kaa aahvaan kiya
 In the book of the two-nation Siddhanti University, Professor Shamsul Islam of Delhi University, it is mentioned that at the 19th session of the Hindu Mahasabha in the year 1937, Savarkar said that today it cannot be assumed that India is a threaded nation in unity, in contrast to Hindustan There are mainly two nations, Hindu and Muslim
 jabaki mohammad ali jinnah ke netritv main muslim lig ne 1940 main pakistan ke taur par musalamaanon ke liye alag raashtra kii maang kii thi
 In history it is known as the two-nation theory
 yahi nahin 15 agast, 1943 ko nagpur main saavarkar ne kaha tha, ‘mistar jinna kii tu nesan theory se meraa koi jhagada nahin he
 We, Hindus, are a nation in themselves and it is a historical fact that Hindu and Muslim are two nations
 ’hindutv ko lekar matbhedaaj kii taarikh main aresas jis 'hindutv' kaa aguva hone kaa daawa karata he is shabd kii utpatti saavarkar kii kalam se hui thi
 Savarkar, the father of Hindutva ideology, propounded this theory in a book called 'hindutva'
 shuru main bhale hi saavarkar or aresas hindutv kii isi avadharana ko lekar aage bade hon, lekin baad main aresas ne apane rukh main parivartan laayaa or ab sangh kaa maananaa he ki hindustan main rahane vaala har vyakti hindu he
 Whereas according to Savarkar's definition of Hindu nation, Christians and Muslims were mostly Hindus until recently and have become followers of the new religion in their first generation
 saavarkar kaa maananaa he ki ye log bhale hi hamase saajha pithrubhumi, mul or samskruti kaa daawa karen, lekin inhen hindu ke rup main manyata nahin di ja sakati
 Cow slaughter and Savarkar Very few people would know that Savarkar was an atheist who defined Hinduism
 gaay ko lekar aaj desh main jari raajnneeti main aresas or bijepi sabase aage hai
 But Savarkar's thinking about the cow was completely different because he considered the cow to be just an animal instead of being divine
 saavarkar kaa kahana tha ki agar aap gaay kaa adhiktam upyog karnaa chaahate hai, to isko bhagwaan bananaa chhodana hoga
 God is at the top
 phir insaan aata he or iske neeche jaanavar
 a cow is also an animal, which has less intelligence than a foolish man
 agar ham gaay ko ishwar maane, to ye insaan kaa apmaan hoga
 Serve the cow, because it is useful
 lekin jab ladaai ke dinon main yaa phir jab ye boj ban jaae to koi vajah nahin he ki ise na maaraa jaae
 Gandhi's assassination Even after independence, the relationship between Savarkar and the Sangh was not very good
 mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke baad hindutvvaadi sanghathan aresas or hindu mahasabha par pratibandh laga diya gaya
 After which differences of opinion emerged between the two organizations during the hearing of this case in court
 aresas ne khud par se pratibandh hataane ke liye tatkaaleen grih mantri sardaar patel ko patr likhe saath hi court cese main saavarkar or unke saathiyon ke samarthan main pairvi bhi nahin kii
 Savarkar's death Today, Savarkar, whose legacy is claimed by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, had left him alone when Savarkar, the leader of the same Hindu nation, went on a fast-unto-death
 savkar ke bhattije or hindu mahasabha ke netaa vikram saavarkar ne apane ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki ve acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki bijepi or aresas saavarkar ke darshan ko nahin saraahte
 BJP and rss's sudden love for Savarkar is betrayed

 Legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mention the players, who are struggling to honor the nation during the Rio Olympics, in his speech on the occasion of 70th Independence Day

 uttar pradesh ke kasganj jile ke nijaampur main dalit yuvak kii baraat nikaalane kaa formula tay ho gaya he
 Sanjay Kumar, a youth of the Dalit community, wanted to remove the procession from the horse during his wedding on April 20
 police savarna samudaay ke khauf se isaki anumati nahin de rahi thi kyonki is gaanv main ajtak ek bhi dalit duulhaa baraat main ghodi par chadhakar nahin aayaa he
 The people of the upper caste community were against taking out the procession on the mare of a Dalit youth
 lekin ab jila prashasan kii madhyasthata ke chalate donon pakshon main samjhauta ho gaya he
 After this, Sanjay's procession will now pass through the curved route
 20 april ko baratupi ke hathras jile ke sanjay kumaar kii shaadi 20 april ko kasganj ke nijaampur main sheethal ke saath honi he
 For this, Sanjay Kumar approached the local police and asked for permission to take out the procession, but the police refused permission
 police ne kaha ki vah ilaaka ucch jati ke logon kaa he, dalit ke vahaan baraat nikaale jane se vahaan hinsa ho sakati he
 The model of the agreement is now settled due to the mediation of the district administration, after which the Dalit youth will come to Nizampur on April 20 with Sanjay Jatav procession
 samjhaute ke tahat ek nakshaa paas kiya gaya he, jis raste se baraat hokar gujaregi
 This route is shown yellow in the map
 iske alaava baraat chadhaane ko lekar kuch niyam-sharten tay kii gai hai, jinhen donon pakshon ne maan liya he
 After the agreement of the procession roadmap of the procession, the Dalit youth's procession will remain in Dharamvir's farm on the main road going to Qutubpur outside the village of Janwasa
 baraat janavasa se prasthaan kar qutubpur-nijaampur road se gaanv ke tirahe se hote hue primary paathshaala ke saamne se, mahesh chouhan ke ghar se saamne se, sarendra chouhan ke ghar paas pashchim disha main satyapal ke ghar tak jaaegi
 The alley through the procession in the village is quite narrow
 isi ke kaaran swechha se aise vaahan or saadhan kaa prayog karenge, jo aasaani se gali se nikal saken
 There will be no leader involved in the procession
 In the agreement it has also been decided that no person belonging to political / non-political organization will be involved in the procession
 iske alaava koi vyakti astr-shastr lekar bhi shaamil nahin hoga
 Apart from this, no one will consume drugs
 koi bhi vyakti aapattijanak bhashaa \ shabd kaa prayog nahin karegaa
 Section 144 is applicable in the district
 is kaaran baraat main koi vyakti aisi bhashaa kaa istemaal nahin karegaa, jisase shanti vyavastha bhang hone kii ashanka ho
 Even today, there is not a single Dalit procession that the bride's house is in Nizampur area of kasganj, there are 40 Dalit houses in that area while 300 upper caste people live
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki jis gaanv main baraat jaani he, vahaan aaj tak daliton kii baraat main duulhaa ghodi par chadhakar nahin aayaa he
 The district administration has made a roadmap under the agreement, under which the procession will be held till the bride's house

 They are now coming out with the second season of 'satyamev Jayate'
 sho ke is duusare sijan kaa nirmaan isi maheene shuru ho chukaa he
 This time the show is expected to be even more explosive and heart touching
 sho ke pehle sijan main dahej pratha, gharelu hinsa, honor kiling, doctorl peshey se gaddari jaise kai muddon ko uthaaya gaya tha
 The first episode of the show will focus on sexual harassment and crime against women
 haal ke saalon main mahilaon ke khilaaf badhate aparaadhon (chhedchhad, yon utpeedan, balaatkaar) ke kaaran mahila suraksha desh ke saamne ek gambhir samasya banakar ubhari he
 The second episode of the second season of Satyamev Jayate will be on the government's emphasis on beautification of the country
 is episod main sarkaar kii praathamikta kii taraf dhyaan dilaayaa jayega, jisamen sarkaar buniyaani jaruraton kii bajaay saundaryikaran par zyada dhyaan detii he
 In this way basic human needs are completely neglected
 iske alaava tok sho main ek or mahatvapurn mudde- vyaktigat suraksha par bhi dhyaan dilaayaa jayega
 Unemployment has increased rapidly in the country due to the current economic pressures, this episode will focus on how economic pressure has led to a distorted mentality and a strong increase in crime
 iske alaava ek episod desh ke bhavishya par bhi hoga
 This episode will take on a big and multidimensional theme
 is open discshan main desh kii aarthik, raajnneetik or saamaajik bhavishya par charchaa ho sakati he
 Only four episodes of Satyamev Jayate-2 will air, after which the show will resume after being shut down for a few weeks
 satyamev jayate-2 ke sabhi 13 episod ek hi baar main prasaarit nahin honge balki inhen teen hisson main baanta jayega
 Aamir Khan told a few days ago that this time many things will be different in Satyamev Jayate
 chaahe iskaa prasaaran ho yaa phir logon ko isse jodne kii pahal, sabakuch badla-badla sa hoga
 In response to a question till date, Aamir said that i just want to change people's hearts
 jisaki koshish ham satyamev jayate ke jariye kar rahe hai
 Aamir Khan told Aaj Tak, 'like last time, this time too the show will have 13 episodes, but this time they are being divided into three parts of the year

 Then after two to three months a part and then in the end of the year will take one month each

 Its president was Sonia Gandhi herself
 sonia ke pradhanmantri banane or 7 rescorse road par unke kabiz hone kii puri sambhaavna thi
 But the Gandhi family itself was not unanimous about Sonia becoming Prime Minister
 rahul gandhi ne iskaa joardaar tareeke se virodh kiya tha
 Rahul feared that his mother would be murdered like his grandmother and father when he became Prime Minister
 rahul apni baat par is had tak ade hue the ki unhone saaf kah diya tha ki apni maa ko pradhanmantri banane se rokane ke liye ve kuch bhi kar guzrenge
 Rahul is a man of strong will and this was not a mere threat
 unhone is bare main nirnay lene ke liye sonia ko 24 ghante kaa vakt diya tha
 Apart from me, Manmohan Singh, Suman Dubey and Priyanka were also present on that occasion
 sonia bahut chintit or dukhi thim
 As a mother, it was impossible for him to ignore Rahul's words
 or hua bhi vahi jo rahul chaahate the
 This was the only reason for Sonia Gandhi not becoming Prime Minister
 sonia ke nirnay kii jaankaree sirf mujhe or manmohan singh ko thi
 Later, Sonia called a meeting

 Once i had cheated on this issue with Sonia

 To this, Sonia had asked, 'who is the other one ?,' my reply was, 'julius Caesar
 ” Last Sunday, Yogi Adityanath left his home from Gorakhpur in a chartered plane sent to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah
 baad main unhone kaha, "yah ek mahatvapurn baithak thi", lekin jor dekar kaha ki vah pradesh ke agle mukhyamantri ke liye daud main nahin the
 And he was right, because where he was standing, there was no race
 kuch ghanton ke baad unhen uttar pradesh kaa nayaa mukhyamantri ghoshit kiya gaya or agle din unhone desh kii sabase adhik aabaadi vaale rajya kaa prabhaar sambhala
 He has been at work ever since
 aaj, vah apane ghar gorakhpur kii ore agrasar hai
 And he is not Yogi Adityanath, who left the city of 6 lakh people in eastern Uttar Pradesh last week
 vah 'adityanath yogi' hai, jaisaa kii lakhanu main unke bangale ke baahar lagi nem plate or sarkaar kii website unke bare main bataa rahi he
 Thousands of people who are standing in queues on the streets of Gorakhpur to welcome Yogi or welcome hoardings when they return, do not really matter
 yah vah shahar he, jisane lagbhag do dashakon se bhaajapa ke bhagavadhari vivaadaaspad hindutv chehre ko chunaa he
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, like before, Adityanath got more votes than all his rivals
 yah bhi vah nirvachan kshetra he, jise adityanath ne sansad main apane vidaai sambodhan main uttar pradesh ke baaki hisson ke liye ek model ke rup main pesh kiya tha
 He said that in Gorakhpur, traders do not have to give goonda tax
 chikitsakon kaa apharan nahin hota
 The local people, leaders, businessmen are leaving no chance to ensure that the Chief Minister gets a grand welcome
 shahar main bhagava lahar he or har ek vyakti ne unka swaagat karne ke liye poster lagaae hai
 In one corner, some workers are still building more hoardings

 There is a saffron wave in the city and every person has put up posters to welcome them
 ek kone main, kuch karmchaaree abhi bhi adhik hording kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai
 The traders' association and community leaders who want to present the bouquet to Yogi (first stop of Adityanath's convoy) on Maharana Pratap College were so long that the district administration had to decide the hierarchy by making a list
 tippaniyan After a meeting with his supporters, the first day of the Chief Minister's visit here will end with a program at Gorakhnath Math, where he is a Mahant, after meeting district officials about development in eastern Uttar Pradesh
 math ke prabandhak dwarka tiwari ne kaha ki padosi jilo se bhi log mukhyamantri ko dekhne aae hai

 In such a situation, buying a home theater by purchasing TV in the budget can prove to be a good option
 isi vikalp ke liye audio diggaj JBL ke paas 2
 1 soundbar available
 iskaa hamane kaaphi samay tak upyog kiya he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 Currently this speaker is available on the official website of JBL India for Rs 23,499
 to aaie jaanate hai kaisaa he yaa ye soundbar
 Build, Design and Specifications: Talking about the build and design of this soundbar, the speaker will be present in two parts
 yani ek base ke liye sabavufar, joki wireles hoga
 Soundbar on the other side, which will control all other functions
 is soundbar kaa luk kaaphi premium he ise aap aasaani se tivi ke neeche rakh sakate hai ye bilkul bhi kharaab feel nahin detaa he
 There are select physical buttons in the top part of the soundbar itself, from which you can operate the soundbar even in the presence of the remote
 vahiin iske peeche ke hisse main saare ports die gaye hai
 It has AUX input, USB OUT, HDMI IN, HDMI OUT for ARC, optical in port
 box ke saath aapako ox cabel or optical cabel milegaa
 Bluetooth connectivity is also available here for the rest of the connectivity
 soundbar ke overol luk kii baat karen to iske drivers ke upar metal kaa gril maujuud he
 The soundbar also has an LED display on the front, which is hidden behind the grill
 isaki raushnee ko raat ke vakt remote se halki bhi kii ja sakati he
 On the other hand, when looking at the subwoofer, its look is also very good
 ye bhi soundbar ko compliment karata he
 6 here
 5-inch base driver maujuud he jo down firing he
 Both the subwoofer and the soundbar are wirelessly connected in seconds
 yani plag and play vaala hi hisaab yahaan rahegaa
 However both will need to be plugged into separate sockets
 khaas baat ye he ki inhen alag-alag par rakhaa ja saktaa he
 To connect the Savubofar to the soundbar one only needs to press the button in the back of the subwoofer
 uske baad ye auto conect ho jate hai
 The soundbar may feel a bit overweight, but its performance is also amazing
 iske saath aane vaale remote kii baat karen to ye premium plastic kaa bana hua he
 Buttons in it are kept very low and easy to see
 inhen oparate kaaphi aasaan smood he
 Here you will get the option of base less, you will get a button to turn on the surround, there will also be a button to go to different sound mode
 baaki buttens standard milenge
 Talking about select specifications, its maximum power output is 300W and frequency response is 40hz to 20khz
 isamen wireles connactivity ke liye bluetooth varjan 4
 Support of 2 is provided
 yani keval bluetooth se ise conect karo or apni pasand ke audio or video content ke maje lo
 Performance: Now talk about its performance, it is very easy to connect it first
 yadi bluetooth connactivity kii bhi baat karen ek baar kisi divaais se conect ho jane ke baad ye seconds main hi auto conect ho jaataa he
 Talking about audio quality, it has to be understood separately for music, film and games
 mujeec kii baat karen to yahaan aapako damdaar sabavufar or soundbar main maujuud twitors ke jariye behtareen sound quality milti he
 You can increase this effect even further by reducing the sync option, sound mode and base present in the remote
 acchhee audio quality ke liye aap soundbar or sabavufar se kuch duuri par rahen varanaa soundbar kii aawaaj ko zyada lag sakati he
 On the one hand, where you will get a great base from the subwoofer, on the other hand you will get crispy high notes from the soundbar
 JBL kii jo phinishing PA audio system main milti waisi hi phinishing yahaan aapako soundbar main bhi milti he
 However, its overall detailing cannot be compared to any studio monitor, as you will not get the same detailing of the instruments
 meri samaj se main ise base ke liye zyada behatar maan saktaa hum
 The design of the subwoofer is also such that the drivers are given at the bottom which gives a soft base and also provides vibration
 kuch kamiyon kii baat karen to game khelte or movie dekhte vakt channel cepereshan kii dikkat mahasoos ho sakati he
 It would be appropriate to turn on the surround for the best filling of the movie
 dhyaan rahe agar content kii audio quality behatar nahin hogi to ye spikar main bhi ricolect hogi or aap bluetooth, HDMI or audio jaik main se alag-alag audio quality ko bhi check kar sakate hai
 Another problem is that 4K passthrough is not present here, which should have been in this price soundbar
 aajkal 4K tivi model vaise bhi bajet main aa rahe hai
 Verdict: So now the question is, should you invest money in this soundbar? So the answer is that you can invest money by relying on this soundbar JBL for needs like movies and music
 yahaan aapako crispi audio quality ke saath-saath premium luk or dizin vaala product milegaa
 There are also some problems like channel separation which may disappoint you to some extent
 lekin in sabase badi baat ye he ki iske liye aapako zyada paisa dena hoga
 Because 5 of companies like Samsung, Sony and LG at even lower cost
 1 home theatre tak mil jate hai
 In such a situation, once you go to a nearby store, you can test the audio quality before buying

 In the year 2017, the government continued to promote cashless transactions
 ummid he ki is saal ke bajet main bhi cashles iconomi ko badhaane ke liye sarkaar ahm ghoshnaaen kar sakati he
 The goal is to achieve the target of 25 billion digital transactions in the current financial year

 Even in villages which were given the title of being a cashless village, cash has returned
 isaki sabase badi vajah he ki chote kaarobaari cashles lenden lene ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 In this budget, the government can give incentives to small businesses to encourage them to do cashless transactions

 In such a situation, the government will be focused on increasing the number of POS

 He has given a chance to some of the lucky people from Bhima and UPI app to travel for free
 duusari taraf, cashles bhugtan karne waalon ko kai suvidhaayen bhi muhaiyaa kii ja rahi hai
 Booking tickets online may be cheaper, given this trend of Indian Railways, cashless payments may remain the focus in the budget
 iske liye online tikat book karnaa sasta kiya ja saktaa he
 With this, cashless payers can also get relief in MDR charges here
 aam aadmi ko bhi denge protsaahanamodi sarkaar kaa focus desh main cashles iconomi ko badhaava dene par he
 For this, she keeps promoting cashless transactions from time to time
 is saal sarkaar upiai or bhim ap ke istemaal ko badhaane par focus kar sakati he
 For this, arrangements can be made to encourage the common man
 bad saktaa he refral bonusiske tahat aam logon kobhim or upiaiap se bhugtan par incentive or chhot die jane kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 With this, the amount of Bhima and UPI app referrals can also be increased

 These were the hands that raised Aarushi for 14 years, raised her eyes, raised her tantrums, but today, those same hands were slaughtered by justice
 sawaal sabase bada khud talwaar danpati par he
 In spite of all the things that have been done, in the last five and a half years, both of them did not show even a slight tremor in their efforts
 koshish thi shaq ke gahare saaye ke bich insaaf ko katghare main khadaa karne kii
 It seemed as if both of them decided to see if justice is big or intrigue? And both of these efforts were also supported by many doubts and questions
 sawaal ye ki mauka-e-vaardaat par koi doosraa maujuud nahin tha
 Only on this basis, how can we believe that only Arushi's parents are entitled to the crime? The decision has been arrived
 par ye saare shaq or sawaal ab bhi zindaa hai
 And will remain until all the answers are received
 kyonki insaaf or saazish ke bich ye pehle ghar kii ladaai thi
 Hanging or life imprisonment? The suspense was just that

 It was argued that this is the rarest of rare case but the argument was weak
 lihaaza adaalat ne ise ansuna kar umr kaid kii sazaa sunai
 The advocate for the waiver in the punishment for the Talwar couple also said that the Talwar couple lost their daughter, but the court did not give much concession and gave its verdict

 Both Rajesh and Nupur Talwar have been sentenced to 5 years imprisonment under section 201 and under section 203 Rajesh Talwar has been sentenced to one year

 The Talwar couple can now appeal to the High Court after being convicted in the murder of daughter and servant Hemraj
 khatm yaa shuruyaat? kya vaaki is ek faisale ke saath ye cese hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye khatm ho gaya yaa phir yahaan se ek nai ladaai kii shuruyaat hui he? ladaai, aarushi ke kaatil tehraae gaye maa-baap ke liye upree adaalaton main apni begunaahi sabit karne kii yaa phir apni beti ko insaaf dilaane kii? kyonki ab talwaar parivaar is faisale ko hai court main chunauti dene kii taiyaari kar rahaa he

 Relatives of the Talwar couple say that they will go to the High Court against the decision of the special CBI court

 The Talwar couple were sent to Dasna jail after being convicted on Monday

 But this time the first night in jail was extremely difficult for this couple

 Nupur Talwar's health deteriorated at 9:30 am on Tuesday morning
 noopur talwaar ne ghabrahat kii shikaayat kii
 His blood pressure was increased to 160 / 106
 jail ke doctor ne aakar noopur talwaar kaa ilaaj kiya
 According to jail sources, Nupur's blood pressure had increased due to not sleeping overnight and tension
 haalanki kuch ghanton ke baad noopur talwaar kii tabiyat sudharne lagi
 If sources are to be believed, earlier Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar were kept in separate cells in the jail
 somvaar 7 baje shaam ko unhen raat ke khaane main roti, daal or sabji di ga, lekin unhone achche se dinar nahin kiya
 She cried 3 times throughout the night
 mangalvaar kii subah bhi unhone sahi se naashtaa nahin kiya
 Rajesh Talwar and Nupur Talwar are yet to spend several nights in jail, but the Talwar couple will be under more pressure than the court sentence for which they have been convicted

 This is the reason why they are weak and afraid to fight for the issues of common man and remove the veil from truth

 Gujarat Congress has tried to revive the party in view of the possibility of early elections in the state
 nae poster, badi meeting
 
 
 The Gujarat Congress tried to give a new impetus to the elections by calling the leaders of the entire state
 somvaar ko ahmedabad main puure rajya se tikat ke icchhukon ko bulaayaa gaya
 After the defeat of Uttar Pradesh, the buzz of early elections has started in Gujarat
 in halaat main congress main niraashaa dur karke utsaah foonkane ke liye party ke bade netaa bhi aage aae hai
 Gurudas Kamat, in charge of the Gujarat Congress, gave us the courage to say that in the 2010 elections we had only one Zilla Panchayat, the rest was with the Bharatiya Janata Party
 lekin 2015 main hue chunaavon main 23 jila panchayaton main congress jiti
 During this time, all the leaders tried hand in hand to indicate that there was no mutual faction
 party main yah sabhi jaanati hai ki gujarat congress paanch guton main banty hui he
 It has its own faction of Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Shankarsinh Vaghela, State Congress President Bharatsinh Solanki, besides Siddharth Patel, Shaktisinh Gohil and Arjun Modhwadia
 inke bich mukhyamantri pad kii ummidavaari ko lekar hameshaa tanatani rahati he
 The comments haalanki party ne is baithak main koshish kii ki gutbaji ke khilaaf maahaul bane or sandesh jaae ki party ek he
 Some leaders like Shankarsinh Vaghela also tried to show unity by separating themselves from the race for the post of CM
 is baithak kii ek vajah yah bhi he ki gujarat main congress pichley do dashakon se satta se baahar he
 For this reason, it has been discussed for some time that big leaders of other states will also join BJP
 is ashanka ke chalate bhi party sabko saath jodne kii kavayad main jute gai he

 For this reason, it has been discussed for some time that like other states, big leaders here will also join BJP

 Everyone in the party knows that the Gujarat Congress is divided into five factions
 isamen vidhansabha main netaa pratipaksh shankarasingh waghela, rajya congress adhyaksh bharatsingh solanki ke alaava siddharth patel, shaktisingh gohil or arjuna modhwadiya ke apane-apane gut hai
 There is always tension between them about the candidature of the Chief Minister
 tippaniyan However, the party tried in this meeting to create an atmosphere against factionalism and the message that the party is one
 shankarasingh waghela jaise kuch netaaon ne khud ko siem pad kii res se alag karke ekta dikhaane kii koshish bhi kii
 One reason for this meeting is that the Congress has been out of power in Gujarat for the last two decades
 isi vajah se pichley kuch samay se charchaa he ki anya rajyon kii tarah yahaan ke bade netaa bhi bijepi main chale jaaenge
 Due to this apprehension, the party has engaged in the exercise of connecting everyone together

 He called his wife and demanded a ransom
 phiroti dene ke liye lekturer kii patni sarjana singh khud chambal ke bihadon main jane kaa faisla kiya

 Although the entire matter was being looked after by the STF, it was decided to pay the ransom in view of the threat to the life of the lecturer

 Legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar believes that young Virat Kohli is the future of Indian cricket and he is ready to take the captaincy from current captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni after losing the Test series to England
 england ne nagpur main chauthaa or antim test drow karake 2-1 kii jeet ke saath bharat main 28 baras baad test shrunkhlaa jiti
 Gavaskar said that the time has come for the selectors to focus on the future, as Dhoni did not appear in rhythm in the series
 purv bhartiya captain gavaskar ne kaha, is test ke chauthe din tak main kahata rahaa ki mahendra singh dhoni kaa koi vikalp nahin he, lekin viraat ke mushkil halaat main shatak jadne ke baad mujhe lagata he ki usne apane bare main acchhee cheez khoj lee he
 i think he is ready to take responsibility
 gavaskar ne ‘enditivi’ se kaha, mujhe lagata he ki isaki ore sakaaratmak tareeke se dekha janaa chahie kyonki yahi bhavishya he
 The former Indian captain criticized the Indian team for the embarrassing defeat, but particularly lambasted Dhoni for his simple and non-aggressive captaincy
 unhone kaha, agar bharat jeetna chahta tha to use raat ke score par hi pari ghoshit karke jajba dikhaanaa chahie tha
 England batted brilliantly, but our bowlers were ineffective and our batsmen did not perform as expected
 yah team kii vifaltaa he
 At the same time, Srikanth said, Dhoni's captaincy has become dull and he is not able to know what to do when things are getting out of hand
 use ab se test captain nahin hona chahie 
 If i were the chairman of the selectors, i would have selected Dhoni as the wicketkeeper and batsman in the team
 tippaniyan Former Indian spinner Bishan Singh Bedi also demanded the removal of Dhoni from captaincy
 unhone kaha, dhoni ko khud ko bhaagyashaalee maananaa chahie ki vah ab bhi vahaan (captain) he
 If Tiger Pataudi or Sunil Gavaskar had lost so many tests, they would not have survived for so long
 bedi ne kaha, usne captain bane rahane ke liye zyada kuch nahin kiya he
 He should have been eliminated only after the World Cup victory
 unhone poocha, vah test captain nahin he
 You need a captain who is a contender for his place in the playing XI
 mujhe bataaiye ki uske 99 ran team ke kisi kaam ke the
 Bedi believes that Kohli should be given the command of the team
 unhone kaha, aap aisa nahin kah sakate ki ham kisi anya khilaadi ko captain nahin bana sakate? main viraat kohli ko captain banaaungaa
