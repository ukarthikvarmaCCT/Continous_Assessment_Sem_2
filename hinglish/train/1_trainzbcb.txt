 The Hate Modi campaign had an interesting twist when a letter to US President Barack Obama went public again on July 24 requesting Modi not to be granted a visa
 ise uttar pradesh se rajyasabha saansad mohammad adib ne likhaa tha or is par 40 rajyasabha saansadon or 25 loksabhaa saansadon ke dastakhat the
 According to Adeeb, the letter was first sent to Obama on November 26 and then on December 5 last year
 adib kaa daawa he ki bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne america main vija kaa mudda uthaaya, isliye unhone dobaaraa ise fax kiya
 After this incident, the Congress has started to stop the sudden loss

 The granting of visas to Modi is a matter of the US government
 ” videsh rajyamantri paranit cor ne kaha, ''is tarah kii maang karnaa kisi ke liye bhi sahi nahin he
 It is for the US to decide
 ” is puure vivaad kaa laabh aakhirkaar modi ko hi mila he kyonki yah ghatana unhen vidweshpurn dushprachaar ke shikaar ke taur par pesh karti he
 Congress leaders believe that they are far behind Modi in terms of social media presence and youth engagement
 ek varisht congressi netaa kehete hai, ''vahaan kuch modi ke chaahane vaale honge to kuch duusare congress ke samarthak bhi, lekin tamaam log aise honge jinka paksh tay nahin he
 We are targeting them
 ”kuch bade congressi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki het modi abhiyaan ke saath sabase badi samasya yahi he ki vah ulta asar kar sakati he
 "the campaign should be on big issues, not individuals," says a Union minister

 "the arrows that the Congress has to deal with Modi, Modi has been using them all for a long time
 inhen sirf painaa karne se kuch nahin hone vaala, congress ko nae aujaar jutaney hi honge

 But the Delhi Police has come up
 police kaa kahana he ki agar jail main band karnaa padaa to ham peeche nahin hatenge
 It is worth noting that the people of Jatsamudiya of Haryana have been demonstrating for the last one year to demand reservation
 haal hi main jantar-mantar par bhi jaaton ne aarakshan ko lekar joardaar pradarshan kiya tha
 Now the Jats say that they will surround the Parliament in Delhi
 haalanki dilli police ne is ilaake main suraksha ke pukhta intjaam kar rakhen hai
 DCP BK Singh says that if those people come here, we will do everything to stop them
 19 march ko ilaake main dhara 144 laga di jaaegi
 The police will not take any kind of risk because it is a question of the safety of Parliament
 sansad kaa ilaaka ek aisa ilaaka he jo ki dilli hi nahin balki desh kaa sabsesurakshit ilaakamana jaataa he
 In this situation, every kind of concrete arrangement has been made in this area
 dilli police sansad kii suraksha main kisi bhi tarah kii laaparvaahee nahin baratna chaahati he
 So both Haryana Police and Delhi Police are working together
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki jat kis tarah sansad tak pahunchate hai

 Encouraging the bureaucrats, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday asked them to initiate new works and expedite the work
 singh ne kaha ki logon main sarkaar main kisi bhi str par ‘udaseenta, kahili or bhrashtachar’ ko lekar pehle se kahin adhik naaraazgi he
 In the first annual conference of Chief Secretaries, Singh said that there is a demand for accountability from all sections including the legislature, judiciary and media
 unhone is do divasiy sammelan main kaha ki badhati janaakankshaayen hamaari nattejey de sakane kii raftaar ko lekar unhen adheer bana detii hai
 There is more resentment today in the public about apathy, evil and corruption of any form at any level of government
 singh ne kaha ki ‘bhavishya ke liye hamaari sambhaavnaaon ke bare main desh main abhootpurv ashaavadita he or aisi kai nayi chunautiyaan hai jo bataur prashaasak hamaare samaksh maujuud hai
 "he said," Governance has become very complex at present
 ’’ suraksha paridrishy par singh ne kaha ki aatankwaad, vidroh or ugravad se kade lekin prabhavi or samvedansheel tareeke se nipate jane kii jarurat he
 Singh said that ensuring the rule of law is the prime responsibility of any government
 tej aarthik pragati ke liye shanti or sampradayik sauhaard kaa maahaul bhi apekshit hota he
 Singh said that due to economic reforms in the last 20 years, the country has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world
 unhone kaha ki desh ke paas ‘haalia vaishvik aarthik mandi kii apni pratikriya ke taur par’ sankaton ke chalate utpann chunautiyon se nipatane kaa samarth he
 In the case of hot scenes, 'dedh Ishqiya' has overtaken the first film 'ishqiya'
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki abhinayta arshad varsi ne apni sah abhinetri huma kuraishi ke saath kuch behad antarang drishy filmaae hai
 Even Madhuri Dixit has shown great immunity in such scenes with Naseeruddin Shah
 jinhone teen saal pehle abhishek choudhary kii 'ishkia' dekhi he unki yaadon main abhi bhi arshad or vidya baalan ke bich filmaae gaye vaastavik se lagate antarang drishy taaja honge
 But according to a source related to the film, Huma and Arshad have crossed all limits while filming intimate scenes for 'dedh Ishqiya'
 itnaa hi nahin, 'dedh ishkia' se filmon main vaapasi karne vaali maadhuri ne bhi nasiruddin ke saath kuch antarang drishy filmaayen hai
 Director Abhishek Chaubey said, 'we shot romantic and intimacy scenes at the very beginning of the film
 ve drishy bahut hi khubasurat ban pade hai
 But i would like to say that Madhuri's character in this is very different from the character Vidya played in 'ishqiya'
 abhishek ne aage bataaya, 'film main maadhuri ne lakhanu ke ek mahal main rahane vaali ek begum kii bhoomika nibhaai he
 Since this film is also about Ishqiya, we have once again examined various aspects of love and romance
 is film main maadhuriji or naseer saab ke bich jo sambandh he, wo 'ishkia' main vidya or arshad ke bich ke sambandh se bilkul alag he
 Abhishek further adds, 'while the intimate scenes played by Vidya were very real and original, Prannoy scenes with Naseer Saheb are played by Madhuri in a very dignified way
 ' abhishek ne bataaya ki unhone 'dedh ishkia' main do tarah kii duniya or bhashaa kii rachana kii he
 He told that a world belongs to Arshad and Naseer Saheb, which is the story of his characters played in the first film
 film main rachi gai duusari duniya maadhuri kii kuleen gharaane vaali vaibhavshaalee duniya he
 Shayari and Mushayars are used in the film
 lekin film main arshad dwaara nibhaayaa gaya ganvaar charitra bhi he
 Huma Qureshi plays Madhuri's friend and confidant in this film
 abhishek ne bataaya, 'huma, maadhuri ke saath kaam karne ke liye bahut utsahit thim
 He played the role of Kannis, a confidant of Madhuri
 film main maadhuri ke saath nibhaae gaye unke drishy bahut khaas hai
 Ever since Kangana Ranaut was chosen for the character Huma, i was in a dilemma ever since
 mujhe ekadam nahin pataa tha ki kya hone vaala he
 'abhishek further said,' i have known Huma since the shooting of 'ek Thi Dion'
 aakhirkaar huma meri sahi pasand ban gayi or main unhen chunane ke liye khud ko shaabaashi dene se roak nahin paaya
 Huma's character in this film is the most complex in many ways
 ' ab 'dedh ishkia' kaa sirf aakhri seen filmaaya janaa baaki he
 The film is expected to release in January 2014

 This ATM is on the first floor and due to Sunday, more customers do not go there

 But later investigation revealed that the objective was robbery of the ATM
 tippaniyan The CCTV footage helped the police to reach the killer, though he had a cloth tied over his face, but despite this he has been identified
 video se ye bhi pataa chalaa he ki uske paas atm todane ke kuch hathiyaar the
 But he could not succeed in his aim
 hatyara ravivaar subah taqariban 3:30 par kiosk main aayaa tha

 The beginning of the Congress party in Punjab for the next year's assembly elections has been 'spoiled'
 satta main vaapasi ke lihaaj se adarsh maane ja rahe (agar aam aadmi party iskaa khel na bigaade ) is rajya main party apane chunaav prabharee ko lekar hi 'ghamaasan' main uljhi hui he
 Prior to the Congress high command, the MP and former Union Minister Kamal Nath was declared the election in-charge for the state
 ve apana kaam shuru kar pate, iske pehle hi vipakshi partiyon ne varsh 1984 ke sikh virdohi dangon main unki kathith bhoomika ko lekar sawaal uthaane shuru kar diye
 As a result, Kamal Nath expressed his inability to carry out this important responsibility for the Punjab elections
 baharhaal, kamalnath kii jagah nayaa chunaav prabharee niyukt karne ke maamle main bhi congress alaakaman apni 'purv kii galati' se sabak sikhta nahin dikhaa
 This time, Asha Kumari of Himachal Pradesh was made election incharge, which is considered more controversial than Kamal Nath
 akhil bhartiya congress cameti kii padaadhikari aashaa kumari par 60 bigha forest land dhokhadhadi kar hadapney kaa aarope he or is maamle main chamba kii court isi varsh farvari main doshi tehraate hue ek varsh kii sajaa bhi suna chuki he
 Although the Upper Court has granted bail to Asha Kumari, but the opposition which is looking into the issue is giving vent to this issue fiercely
 aise main ho saktaa he ki congress ko nayaa chunaav prabharee chunane kii sharmindagi phir se uthaani pade
 Asha Kumari, who has been elected to the assembly five times, is a relative of the state's CM Virbhadra Singh
 varsh 2004-05 main unhen tab istipha dena padaa tha jab court ne jameen par kabja karne ke maamle main aashaa kumari or anya aropiyon par aarope tay kiye the
 Actually, a man named Kuldeep Singh had alleged that Asha Kumari fraudulently seized about 60 bighas of land
 shikaayat par karrwai karte hue adaalat ne aarope tay kiye or isi varsh maamle main chamba kii adaalat ne aashaa kumari ko ek saal kii sajaa suna di
 Although the Upper Court suspended the sentence and gave them time to appeal, the issue has become a matter of political storm
 tippaniyan The appointment of Asha Kumari has become a sore throat for the Congress, which is finding it difficult to both swallow or swallow
 yadi vah aashaa kumari kii niyukti ko barkaraar rakhte hue aage badhati he to punjab chunaav main use baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 On the other hand, canceling this appointment is also not easy
 aisi sthiti main congress ko sharmindagi uthaani padegi so alag, vipakshi partiyaan janata tak yah sandesh bhi pahunchaa sakati he ki 'congress punjab kaa chunaav ladegi, uske paas to chunaav prabharee niyukt karne tak ke liye koi prabhaavshaalee netaa tak nahin he
 'at a time when the Congress is desperately trying to make a comeback in the state, this situation is continuously causing damage to the party
 congress punjab ko apane liye behad ahm maan rahi he or isiliye party ne rajya ke liye chunaav ranneeti ke 'chanakya' prashanth kishor kii sevaayen lee hai
 As it is, the growing drug addiction and anti-incumbency factor in the state are becoming a roadblock to the ruling Akali dal-bjp alliance
 badal parivaar par bhrashtachar ke aarope or akali-bijepi ke bich matbhed kii ek mudda he or iske kaaran logon main naaraazgi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party, the third major party, is also pushing for power in another state after Delhi, but due to lack of experience and how much the people of Punjab will show their trust in the 'tutu-main' era with the Center in Delhi, It is difficult to say
 kul milakar congress party ke liye vaapasi ke lihaaj sthiti puri tarah adarsh thi, lekin chunaav prabharee kii niyukti ke mudde par 'aatmghaatee gol' se congress ne apane avasaron ko dhundhala hi kiya he
 
 
 
 congress alaakaman ke pehle, saansad or purv kendriya mantri kamalnath ko rajya ke liye chunaav prabharee ghoshit kiya tha
 Even before he could start his work, opposition parties started raising questions about his alleged role in the 1984 anti-sikh riots
 parinaam yah hua ki kamalnath ne punjab chunaav ke liye mili yah ahm jimmedaari nibhaane main asamarthta jataa di
 However, even in the matter of appointing a new election in-charge in place of Kamal Nath, the Congress high command did not learn a lesson from his 'erstwhile mistake'
 is baar himachal pradesh kii aashaa kumari ko chunaav prabharee banaaya gaya jo ki kamalnath se bhi adhik vivaadit maani ja rahi hai
 All India Congress Committee officer Asha Kumari is accused of robbery of 60 bigha forest land fraud and in this case, the court of Chamba has convicted and sentenced to one year in February this year
 haalanki upree court aashaa kumari ko jamaanat de chuki he, lekin mudda talash rahaa vipaksh is mudde ko jamkar hawa de rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Congress may have to bear the shame of electing a new election incharge
 paanch baar vidhansabha ke liye chuni ja chuki aashaa kumari rajya ke siem virbhadra singh kii rishtedaar hai
 In the year 2004-05, he had to resign when the court framed charges against Asha Kumari and other accused in the possession of the land
 darasal, kuldeep singh naam ke ek shaks ne aarope lagaaya tha ki aashaa kumari ne dhokhadhadi karte hue kareeb 60 bigha jameen hathiyaa lee he
 Acting on the complaint, the court framed the charges and in the same year, the court of Chamba sentenced Asha Kumari to one year in prison
 haalanki upree adaalat ne sajaa ko suspend karte hue unhen apil ke liye vakt de diya he, lekin yah mudda siyaasi tufaan kaa vishay to ban hi gaya he
 The comments aashaa kumari kii niyukti kaa maamla congress ke liye gale kii haddi ban gaya he jise ugalane yaa nigalane donon main use baari mushkil ho rahi he
 If she goes ahead with the appointment of Asha Kumari, she may have to suffer a huge loss in the Punjab elections
 duusari ore, is niyukti ko radd karnaa bhi aasaan nahin he
 In such a situation, the Congress will have to bear embarrassment, so apart from this, the opposition parties can also reach the public that 'congress will contest the election of Punjab, it does not even have an influential leader to appoint an election in-charge

 This time, Asha Kumari of Himachal Pradesh was made election incharge, which is considered more controversial than Kamal Nath
 akhil bhartiya congress cameti kii padaadhikari aashaa kumari par 60 bigha forest land dhokhadhadi kar hadapney kaa aarope he or is maamle main chamba kii court isi varsh farvari main doshi tehraate hue ek varsh kii sajaa bhi suna chuki he
 Although the Upper Court has granted bail to Asha Kumari, but the opposition which is looking into the issue is giving vent to this issue fiercely
 aise main ho saktaa he ki congress ko nayaa chunaav prabharee chunane kii sharmindagi phir se uthaani pade
 Asha Kumari, who has been elected to the assembly five times, is a relative of the state's CM Virbhadra Singh
 varsh 2004-05 main unhen tab istipha dena padaa tha jab court ne jameen par kabja karne ke maamle main aashaa kumari or anya aropiyon par aarope tay kiye the
 Actually, a man named Kuldeep Singh had alleged that Asha Kumari fraudulently seized about 60 bighas of land
 shikaayat par karrwai karte hue adaalat ne aarope tay kiye or isi varsh maamle main chamba kii adaalat ne aashaa kumari ko ek saal kii sajaa suna di
 Although the Upper Court suspended the sentence and gave them time to appeal, the issue has become a matter of political storm
 tippaniyan The appointment of Asha Kumari has become a sore throat for the Congress, which is finding it difficult to both swallow or swallow
 yadi vah aashaa kumari kii niyukti ko barkaraar rakhte hue aage badhati he to punjab chunaav main use baari nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 On the other hand, canceling this appointment is also not easy
 aisi sthiti main congress ko sharmindagi uthaani padegi so alag, vipakshi partiyaan janata tak yah sandesh bhi pahunchaa sakati he ki 'congress punjab kaa chunaav ladegi, uske paas to chunaav prabharee niyukt karne tak ke liye koi prabhaavshaalee netaa tak nahin he
 'at a time when the Congress is desperately trying to make a comeback in the state, this situation is continuously causing damage to the party
 congress punjab ko apane liye behad ahm maan rahi he or isiliye party ne rajya ke liye chunaav ranneeti ke 'chanakya' prashanth kishor kii sevaayen lee hai
 As it is, the growing drug addiction and anti-incumbency factor in the state are becoming a roadblock to the ruling Akali dal-bjp alliance
 badal parivaar par bhrashtachar ke aarope or akali-bijepi ke bich matbhed kii ek mudda he or iske kaaran logon main naaraazgi he
 The Aam Aadmi Party, the third major party, is also pushing for power in another state after Delhi, but due to lack of experience and how much the people of Punjab will show their trust in the 'tutu-main' era with the Center in Delhi, It is difficult to say
 kul milakar congress party ke liye vaapasi ke lihaaj sthiti puri tarah adarsh thi, lekin chunaav prabharee kii niyukti ke mudde par 'aatmghaatee gol' se congress ne apane avasaron ko dhundhala hi kiya he
 
 
 
 paanch baar vidhansabha ke liye chuni ja chuki aashaa kumari rajya ke siem virbhadra singh kii rishtedaar hai
 In the year 2004-05, he had to resign when the court framed charges against Asha Kumari and other accused in the possession of the land
 darasal, kuldeep singh naam ke ek shaks ne aarope lagaaya tha ki aashaa kumari ne dhokhadhadi karte hue kareeb 60 bigha jameen hathiyaa lee he
 Acting on the complaint, the court framed the charges and in the same year, the court of Chamba sentenced Asha Kumari to one year in prison
 haalanki upree adaalat ne sajaa ko suspend karte hue unhen apil ke liye vakt de diya he, lekin yah mudda siyaasi tufaan kaa vishay to ban hi gaya he

 mumbai ke vankhede stadium main khele gaye world tii20 ke duusare semifinal match main westeindies ne bharat ko haraakar final kaa tikat hasil kar liya he
 Virat Kohli, who has been playing the role of a hero for the last several matches for Team India, emerged as the hero once again in this match, but he could not save the match
 semifinal mukaable main team india chej nahin kar rahi thi, isliye kohli kii dhansu batting bharat ko jeet nahin dilaa saki
 Team India suffered a defeat despite Chris Gayle settling early after Kohli and Rohit's batting batting
 aaie aapako bataate hai is match main haar ke paanch kaaran
 1
 no ball par tapake vikempani pari kii shuruyaat main hi westeindies 19 gendon par do bade wicket khokar sankat main tha
 From here, Charles and Simmons pushed the innings to 42 runs in 6 overs
 saatvaan over lekar aae ravichandran aswin ne pehali chaar gendon par paanch ran dene ke baad paanchavin gend phenki, ye gend windies ko ye match jitaane vaale landal simons ke balle kaa bahari kinaaraa lekar sidhe jasprit bumraah ke paas gai jinhone shandaar kaich pakad liya
 But the Indian team had not even been able to celebrate the wicket that it was found that Ashwin's ball was a no ball
 lekin is nobal se maano kam nuksaan hua ho, 15waan over lekar aae hardik pandya ne pehle to apni pehali paanch gendon par 11 ran lutaae or phir aakhri gend no ball phenk di
 Unfortunately, Lendl Simmons was also out on this ball
 is tarah simons ko no ball par do jeevandaan mili jo bharat par baari pade
 Captain Dhoni also admitted after the match that these no balls spoiled the whole game
 2
 While Hardik Pandya's short balls, young all-rounder Hardik Pandya throws short pitch balls on most occasions, but in this match he crossed the limit
 pandya ne world tii20 ke duusare semifinal main apane chaar overon main 95 fisadi genden choti, bahut choti rakhin
 The long, strong batsmen of the West Indies took advantage of this persistent mistake by Pandya and conceded 43 runs in his four overs
 pandya ne apane chaar overon main chaar chauke or teen chakke khaae
 3
 jadeja-aswin kii dhulaampani pichon par team india kii jeet kaaphi had tak aswin-jadeja par nirbhar karti he
 But in this match, both of them left no stone unturned to sink India's Lutia
 pehle to aswin ne no ball phenkakar simons ko jeevandaan diya or phir apane pehle do overon main hi 20 ran lutaa die
 The fact of Ashwin's poor bowling was that skipper Dhoni could not dare to bowl the full four overs with his best spinner
 ravindra jadeja ne to is match main had hi kar di
 What we consider to be our best all-rounder, he does very little with the bat and in this match he did it with the ball, which no one would have imagined
 jadeja ne apane chaar overon main chaar chauke or teen chakke khate hue 48 ran lutaa die
 4
 landal simons-johnson charles or andre rasel kii battingajab bharat ne kohli kii badaulat scoreboard par 192 ran taangane ke baad gail or sampuls ko jaldi out kiya, aadhe bharat ne jashn manaanaa shuru kar diya
 But Lendl Simmons, playing for the first time in this tournament, had different intentions
 unhone pehle to johnson charles ke saath milakar tisare wicket liye 61 gendon par 97 ranon kii saajhedaari kii
 And after Charles's dismissal, Simmons, along with Andre Russell, snatched the match from Virat Kohli for an unbeaten 80-run partnership for just 39 balls for the fourth wicket
 charles ne is match main 36 gendon par saat chaukon or do chhakkon kii madad se 52 ran banaae
 Andre Russell, swinging the bat like a sword, beat the Indian bowlers fiercely and scored 43 not out with the help of three fours and four sixes in just 20 balls
 main of da match landal simons ne to is match main kamaal hi kar diya
 Simmons, who came in at number four, scored an unbeaten innings of 82 runs with the help of seven fours and five sixes off 51 balls to lead the Windies to the final
 5
 Ajinkya Rahane, who was playing as the second opener, kept looking for a single-double at one end despite a fast start given by dhoni-rahane's slow batting Rohit Sharma
 is match main 10 se zyada ran banane vaale ballebaajon main rahane kaa strike rate sabase kam 114
 It was 28
 haalanki rahane ne is match main 40 ran banaae lekin iske liye unhone 35 genden barbaad kii
 If he had scored 10-15 runs after playing so many balls, then the end of the match could have been different
 inke alaava match ke baad is pich par koi bhi score surakshit nahin tha kehane vaale captain kool mahendra singh dhoni ne agar last main aakar strike rotate karne ke bajaay carabian gendbaajon par hamalaa bolaa hota to shaayad wo bhi nau gendon par mahaj ek chauke ke saath 15 ran ke bajaay 25-30 ran bana sakate the jo shaayad team india ko jitaane ke liye kaaphi hote

 No matter what the year of his retirement was
 gauratlab he ki zyaadaatar sanyakarmi to 60 saal kii umr se pehle hi ritair ho jate hai
 There is a considerable difference in the pension of military personnel retired 10-15 years ago and recently retired military personnel on the same rank
 is antar ko paatane kii maang kaaphi samay se kii ja rahi thi or ise lekar purv sanyakarmi kaaphi bhavuk bhi hai
 The comments 2008-2010 ke bich ritair hue sanyakarmiyon ne to kai baar raashtrapati bhawan tak march bhi kiya or apane veerta padak waapas karne kii peshkash bhi kii thi
 According to sources, the final round of talks will be held with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 19 when he returns from the tour of three countries
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is yojana kaa shubharambh modi sarkaar kaa ek saal puraa hone ke maukey par kiya jayega

 yahi nahin, sarkaar pehle hi spasht kar chuki he ki 'van rank, van pension' yojana 1 april 2014 se lagu hogi
 This means that ex-servicemen who receive less pension than their counterparts will also get lump sum as arrears

 isamen samvidhan kii prastaavna se samaajawaadee or secular shabd gaayab hai
 The Congress has targeted the Modi government for this advertisement
 vigyaapan main samvidhan kii prastaavna di gai he, lekin 1976 main 42wein samvidhan sanshodhan ke jariye jode gaye samaajwaad or secular shabd nadaarad hai, kyonki vigyaapan main puraani prastaavna hi di gai he
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari has objected to this
 unhone twit kiya ki samvidhan kii prastaavna se socialist or secular shabd hataa die gaye
 Will they be replaced by communal and corporate words? haalanki bijepi kaa kahana he ki ye jaanboojhkar nahin hua
 According to party spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao, this was not done intentionally and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting would explain the situation
 baad main soochna prasaaran rajyamantri rajyavardhan singh rathod ne sarkaar kaa paksh rakhaa
 According to Rathore, the words secular and socialist are not appearing in the advertisement
 ye donon shabd 1976 main kiye gaye sanshodhan ke baad aae hai, par iskaa matlab ye kahana katai nahin he ki usase pehle kii sarkaar secular nahin thi
 Rathore says that the same picture has been used in the advertisement, which was earlier on Republic Day
 rathod ne ye bhi kaha ki samvidhan kii prastaavna kii yahi tasviir pichley saal april bhi sarkaar ke vigyaapan main istemaal kii gai thi or tab se ab tak sirf sarkaar hi badali he
 Rathore says that there is nothing wrong in both the advertisements, but the way it is being misquoted is not right

 'when all the people of the house are happy to cut grass and raise cattle dung, what will you read? If you will not pass the first division in the examination, then what is the need for so much hard work? ', ye shabd hai binaa ke sasuraal waalon ke
 Due to studies and exams, in-laws expelled Bina and her mere one-year-old girl from the house
 madhepura jile kii rahanevaali binaa pariksha centre par sabase pehle pahunch jaati hai kyonki vah pariksha centre par hi rahati hai
 The in-laws have thrown Bina and her baby girl out of the house due to taking the exam
 lekin madhepura administration ne is maamle ko gambhirtha se lete hue unke rahane kii vyavastha pariksha centre par hi kar di
 Bina wakes up at 6 am at the examination center
 thode samay ke liye pariksha kii taiyaari karti hai
 After that she feeds and feeds her baby girl
 vahiin, college ke staff ke sadsyparikshadete samay unki bacchee ko sambhalate hai
 However, Bina's mother has now come to the examination center to help her
 ek akhbaar ko die gaye intervyuu main binaa ne bataaya ki pichley saal vah do vishyon main fail ho gayi thim
 After this, he again decided to take the 10th exam
 tab se unhone apni padhai par kaaphi dhyaan diya
 He told, 'I want to pass the first grade in class 10th
 pichley saal main do subjects main fail ho gai thi
 After this, i have given a lot of attention to studies

 Bina has not filed any FIR against him yet
 binaa kahati hai ki wo apane maayke main bhi rah saktin thim lekin pariksha centre se unka ghar 15 kilometre kii duuri par he
 Bina is very unhappy due to the behavior of her in-laws, but her problems have been solved to a large extent by the help and living arrangements made by the officers and staff of the examination center
 pariksha centre ke magistrate kehete hai ki unhen nahin pataa ki binaa padhai main kisi hai or vah pariksha paas kar paaegi yaa nahin
 But the way Bina has struggled for studies is a commendation and this is her biggest success
 binaa ab apane pati ke ghar lautne ke baad hi sasuraal waapas janaa chaahati hai

 She wouldn't stop shedding these drops of nuts , they wouldn't stop gathering by a chill ran down her bark all into her roots , And the Earth shook and people let loose She burst out laughing , dancing , singing a song The tree of life had shed her thorns She was now ready to bear more fruit than ever ; What use would they be ? - all these little people were now scared of her , forever So she uprooted herself , and walked off There she goes , hopping away into infinity She had finally found peace ,love and divinity ! # rheality # imapoetandnowyouknowita post shared byrhea Chakraborty(@rhea_chakraborty) onoct 6, 2019 at 6:29am pdtview this post on instagramcome Rain🌧, Come Snow⛄️ Wherever Your Dreams take You You Gotta Go

 Significantly, a few days ago, the DRI also busted a similar racket from Delhi airport
 police ne is maamle main 10 aropiyon ko giraftaar bhi kiya tha
 (from input language) bharat main yah apane tarah kii pehali ghatana thi jab ek sansadeey samiti ke sadsy kisi udyog ke liye khuli lobbying kar rahe the or udyog bhi kukhyat tambaakoo kaa
 As a BJP MP and prominent bidi maker, a member of the Parliamentary Committee, he was not only making rules for his own industry, but was also openly advocating drinking and drinking
 alabatta sabase zyada sharmnaak yah tha ki sarkaar ne is sansadeey samiti kii baat maan lee or tambaakoo se khatre kii chetavanee ko prabhavi banane kaa kaam roak diya
 Interestingly, this mobilization of the mps was not against stopping the sale of bidi tobacco, but merely against increasing the size of the cancer warning (40 to 85 percent) on cigarette packets
 bas itane par hi sarkaar jhuk gai or faisle par amal roak diya gaya
 After questions were raised on the statements of members of Parliamentary Committee and the Beedi King MP, the Prime Minister was heard of being "serious" but neither government issued a notification to increase the size of the warning on cigarette packing until this article was written
 Nor has Beedi Sultan been removed from the Parliamentary Committee (subordinate Legislation)
 nashili dawaaon par man kii baton or kism-kism kii naitik shikshaaon ke bich tambaakoo par sarkaar kya kadam uthaaegi, yah to pataa nahin
 However, the open mobilization of Beedi Sultan and BJP MP of Uttar Pradesh in favor of tobacco has definitely exposed the biggest cancer of the politics which almost every political party has tried to cover
 sarkari filon tak nijee companiyon ke karindon kii pahunch ke taaje maamalon kii tulana main bidi prasang kai kadam aage kaa he jahaan companiyon ke pravartak janpratinidhi ke rup main khud apane liye hi kanoon bana rahe hai
 When tobacco, which is internationally certified to be fatal, can be openly mobilized in its favor, there are many doubts about policies related to other industries
 bidi tambaakoo prakaran centre sarkaar kii nitiyon se judaa he
 When this situation is under the prime minister's nose, then how the policies of the states will be formed can only be gauged
 bharat main udyogpati saansad or kaarobaari netaaon kaa taana-bana bahut bada he
 There are other examples of beedi industrialists like MP
 'janaseva' ke saath unki kaarobaari tarakkee hamen khuli ankhon se dikh sakati he lekin ise sthapit karnaa mushkil he
 Transparency requires setting the scale
 bharat kii puri siyasat ne gahari mileebhagat ke saath raajnneeti or kaarobaar ke rishton kii kabhi koi saaf paribhaasha tay hi nahin hone di
 As a result, leaders feel business alliances but metering is not possible
 haalanki puri duniya ham jaisi nahin he
 In countries where attempts have been made to measure this alliance, the results have raised the senses
 america ke open data research, jarnalism or swayamsevi sanghathan, sanlite foundation ne pichley saal november main ek shodh jari kiya tha jo america main company raajnneeti gathjod kaa sabase sansanikhej khulaasa tha
 This research proves that the top 200 politically active companies in the US 5 between 2007 and 2012 on donations and lobbying of political parties (required to state spending on lobbying according to US law)
 8 arab dollar kharch kiye (http: / / bit
 ly / vvvdviw) and in turn 4 them from the government
 4 kharab dollar kaa kaarobaar or phaayde hasil hue
 The Sunlight Foundation spent about a year for companies, donations, elections, etc
 4 karod dastavej khangaalane ke baad paaya ki padtaal ke daayre main aane vaali companiyon ne apane kul kharch kaa lagbhag 26 fisad hissaa siyasat main nivesh kiya
 The Sunlight Foundation called it a fixed fortune, that is, investment in politics and a guarantee of profit
 bharat main agar is tarah kii bebaak padtaal ho to nattejey hamen awak kar denge
 Mumbai-based brokerage firm Aquibit Capital created an index of politically connected companies comprising 75 companies with political connections, suggesting that from 2009 to mid-2010, the spurt in shares of these companies made the BSE 500 the flagship index of the Mumbai stock market
 racked up
 alabatta 2010 main ghotaalon par kaig kii report aane ke baad yah suchakank teji se tut kar aktubar 2013 main talahati par aa gaya
 The index of political opinion companies has shown a jump from January 2014 and a sharp jump from April 2014
 tab tak bharat main nai sarkaar ke asaar spasht ho gaye the
 In India, the leader business alliances should be covered up to the facts of the financial investment of the leaders and the monopoly of government contracts in the states, but it is difficult to fully understand the investigation or the empire of politically connected companies like Sunlight Foundation
 bharat ke paas raajnneetik paardarshita kaa kakehara bhi nahin he
 We can neither know the full details of the donations of political parties nor the accounts of the companies reveal how much money they gave to which party
 is hamaam main sabko ek jaisaa rahanaa acha lagata he
 It is not surprising that the BJP avoided its bidi (crony) capitalism by giving light-hearted warnings calling it a conflict of interest
 cigarette packing par chetavanee ke khilaaf saansadon kii lamabandi or bijepi ke bade netaaon kii chuppi sirf yahi nahin bataati ki bijepi paardarshee raajnneeti ke utani hi khilaaf he jitani ki congress or anya dal
 The more surprising thing is that when the Prime Minister's watch on the leaders and ministers has turned into an anecdote, how does the bidi manufacturer get the job of making laws for the tobacco industry? Of course, the first one year of the government has not seen major stains but not showing stains does not mean that there are no stains at all
 chetane kaa mauka he kyonki agar ek baar daag khule to badhate chale jaaenge
 The bank's board meeting is being held today amid the ongoing deadlock between the central government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak main vitt mantralay or arabiai ke bich ahm binduon par sahmati ban sakati he
 This meeting has started in Mumbai
 sarkaar or rigerv bank ke bich kathith tanatani lambey vakt se dekhne ko mil rahi he, jiske bich aaj bank ke nideshak mandal kii baithak ho rahi he
 Earlier, there have been comments from the government and the bank
 arabiai ke dipti governor viral acharya apni tippanee main kah chuke hai ki sarkarein jo apane kendriya bank kii swatantraaa kaa sammaan nahin karatin, unhen jaldi yaa deree main vittiya bazaar kii naaraazgi kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 On the other hand, the RBI governor has also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi amidst this boast
 news agency bhashaa ke mutabik, is baithak main vitt mantralay ke namit nideshak or kuch swatantra nideshak governor urjit patel or unki team par emsamai (MSME) ko karj se lekar kendriya bank ke paas uplabdh kosh ko lekar apni baat rakh sakate hai
 According to sources, the government and the Reserve Bank are also likely to arrive at a solution by mutual agreement on the framework of Quick Corrective Measures (PCA) and relaxation of the provisions for lending to the MSME sector
 iske alaava enbiensi ke liye special windo kaa mudda bhi is baithak kaa hissaa ban saktaa he
 The RBI board has 18 members
 The Reserve Bank has 18 members on its board
 haalanki, isamen sadasyon kii sankhya 21 tak rakhane kaa praavdhaan he
 Members include Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel and four other deputy governors, full-time official directors
 inke alaava anya 13 sadsy sarkaar dwaara namit hai
 The government-nominated members include two finance ministry officials, Subhash Chandra Garg, secretary of financial affairs, and Rajiv Kumar, secretary of financial services
 congress kaa aropcongress netaa pi
 Chidambaram has alleged that the Modi government has made an intention to capture the Reserve Bank of India's reserves
 chidambaram ne kaha, 'duniya main kahin bhi kendriya bank, uske nideshak mandal dwaara prabandhit company nahin he
 To suggest that people from private companies would instruct the governor is ridiculous
 'bataa den ki rigerv bank ke paas 9

 iesai ke ek purv pramukh ne aarope lagaaya he ki purv raashtrapati parvej musharraf ko pataa tha kiosama bin ladenabatabad main chupa hua he or pakistani khufia agency ne khud us surakshit ghar kaa nirmaan kiya tha jahaan vah rahata tha
 Former CIA officer Bruce Riedel quoted former ISI chief General (retired) Ziauddin Khwaja alias Ziauddin Butt as saying that Musharraf 'knew that Laden was in Abbottabad
 ’ di daily bist website par daale gaye ek lekh main redelle ne aage bat ke hawaale se likhaa he ki abtabad main laden kaa surakshit ghar intelegence beuro ke purv pramukh brigadier ejaj shah ke aadesh par banaaya gaya tha
 Riedel stated in the article, 'ziauddin says that Ejaz Shah is responsible for settling Laden in Abbottabad, ensuring his safety and hiding it from outsiders, and Ziauddin says that Musharraf should know all about it i know
 ’ haalanki bat ne aaj jeeyo news channel ke saath baatcheet main kaha ki lekh main unka hawala galat tareeke se diya gaya he
 He refused to divulge more details about this
 america vishesh balon ne abtabad main ek parisar main sainya karrwai ke jariye pichley saal may main al kaayda pramukh ko maar giraaya tha
 The complex was just a few furlongs away from the Pakistani Military Academy
 uske baad se america adhikari lagaataar sawaal uthaa rahe hai ki kya pakistani suraksha adhikariyon ko desh main laden ke chupe hone ke bare main jaankaree nahin thi
 It is said that Laden had been living in this complex for the last five years
 redelle ne apane lekh main america andeh ko jaahir karte hue likhaa he, ‘jab se navy cills ne abtabad main laden ko chupa paaya tab se hi pakistan ke saath america sambandhon main yah sawaal uth rahaa he: kise pataa tha ki vah vahaan chupa he
 Butt was made the ISI chief by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and he held the post during 1996–99
 vah paak sena kii stritegic plance divijan ke pehle pramukh the jo parmaanu jakhire par niyantran rakhti he
 Sharif made Butt the army chief in October 1999
 us samay sharif ne musharraf ko hataane kaa prayaas kiya tha
 But Musharraf then overthrew Sharif's government through a coup
 bat ko do saal tak ekant main rakhaa gaya or sena se hataane ke saath hi unki sampatti ko kurk kar diya gaya
 Riedel has also underlined that it is for this reason that it makes sense for Butt to speak so bitterly against Musharraf
 udhar brigadier(sevanivruth) ejaj shah us samay intelegence beuro ke pramukh rahe hai jab purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto 2007 main aatm nirvaasan se pakistan lauti thim
 Bhutto accused Shah of attempting to assassinate him, which he denied
 shah ke britain main paidaa hue kashmiri ugravadi ahamed umr said ke saath ghanishtha sambandh rahe hai jo teen british or ek america ke apharan ke maamle main 1994 main bharat main jail kii sajaa kaat chukaa he
 Saeed was released in December 2000 after Pakistani militants hijacked an Indian aircraft to Kandahar
 said patrkaar danniel parl ke apharan kii sajeesh kaa bhi hissaa rahaa tha or shah se ja mila tha
 Riedel wrote, 'we don't know who was helping to hide bin Laden but we need to find him
 yadi vah(musharraf) is bare main jaanate the to agali baar jab bhi vah america kii dharti par kadam rakhen to unase poochtacha kii jaani chahie
 "he also wrote that if the US administration could find out who had hidden bin Laden," we might know who is hiding his successor Ayman Zawahiri and the rest of al Qaeda militants
 ’ Manohar Parrikar also said that Goa has been very fortunate in terms of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political career
 parrikar ne kaha, "(narendra) modi ko pradhanmantri banane kaa faisla bhi goa main hi liya gaya tha

 In the last four years, the government, which has been wooing industry leaders through Make in India, suddenly remembered the poor industry and the small industries due to demonetisation-gst, which the Finance Ministry has put a gun on the Reserve Bank
 ham is par aashcharya kar sakate hai, yah jaanate hue bhi ki bank or vittiya pranali karj ke fande main funskar buree tarah haaf rahe hai or chah maah baad yah musiibat fat padegi, phir bhi sarkaar aakhir bainkon ko karj kii revadiyon kaa bazaar kholane ke liye kyon kah rahi he?darasal, chunaav saamne he or bhartiya arthvyavastha kii raftaar par ban ai he
 The weather is getting worse
 pichley do maah kaa ghatnakram bataa rahaa he ki bade chunaav se pehle growth ke aankade sarkaar ke chunaav prachaar ko badmaja kar sakate hai
 The government's latest anxiety about debt stems from this fear
 aarthik vikaas dar main ab tej giravat ke asaar hai
 Four weaknesses already exist
 ek—notebandi or jiesti ke baad se bazaar main maang nadaarad he kyonki na to nijee nivesh main badhat ho rahi he or na upabhokta khapat main
 Two - the phase of increasing interest rates has begun
 teen—jiesti kii chapat se sarkaar ke rajasav main giravat he, ghaataa or natijatan karj bad rahaa he
 And four- banks troubled by outstanding debts are not in a position to distribute new loans, nor can the government bear the burden of salvage of these banks from its own pocket
 in teen buniyadi chunautiyon ke baavjood arthvyavastha kisi tarah dhulak rahi thi lekin sitambar ke baad maahaul buree tarah badal gaya
 a crisis in the financial market is beginning between the rupee's weakness and the rise in crude oil prices
 sitambar ke pehle saptaah main achaanak kai gaiyr banking vittiya companiyaan (enbiensi) bainkon kii tarah hi bakaayaa karj kii beemaari kii chapet main aa gayi
 This was the only time when the interest rate in the market was also increasing, so it became difficult for them to raise new debt and there was a lack of capital in the market
 ab khatra vikaas dar girane kaa he kyonki
 
 
 1
 bainkon ke bakaayaa karj ke jaal main funsane ke baad gaiyr-banking vittiya companiyaan karj or puunji kaa pramukh strot thim
 The economy's dependence on NBFC debt increased by more than five per cent between 2014-18
 enbiensi ke doobane ke saath sabase bada khatra achal sampatti ke bazaar par he jahaan houseing finance companiyon kii karj kii aapurti 2013-18 ke bich 27 fisadi kii gati se badi he
 nbfcs and housing finance are expected to face a deep crisis in the real estate market due to poor supply of debt or costly loans
 khatra he ki kai achal sampatti companiyaan or develper mushkil main honge jaisaa ki ilaphes ke saath hua he
 The government is pushing banks towards more risk in the disorganized debt market
 2
 The latest phase of the slowdown in the market was the purchase of tractors, mobile phones and other consumer products, depending on nbfc's debt
 yahaan maang or bikri buree tarah prabhavit hui he, jiskaa asar is baar tyohaari mausam kii kharid par bhi dikhaa
 The daily capital and microfinance needs of small traders were also being met by this parallel banking
 3
 Though the government has tried to open the loan pipe from banks through the Reserve Bank, has stopped the treatment of banks' npas but it is not up to them to stop the inflation of loans
 pichley do maheene main baikon ne nae karj par byaaj daren badhaai hai
 There is no scope for the deposit rates to come down, so along with nbfcs, the loan to consumers and traders will also be expensive and in addition to this, interest rates are also increasing in the US and Europe
 byaaj daron or growth kaa rishta samvedansheel he
 The latest history of the Indian economy shows that if interest rates on short-term debt (as it is now) continue to rise for a long time, then the growth rate is bound to fall
 chunaav saamne he or sarkaar kaa bajet bepatori he isliye nae sarkari nivesh kii gunjaaish kam he
 Starting next quarter, the GDP growth rate may start to decline
 agle saal farvari se may tak jab desh main chunaav kaa ashwamedh yajna chal rahaa hoga tab badi baat nahin ki bhartiya arthvyavastha kii vikaas dar dhalaan kii nai manzilen naap rahi ho
 The danger of the growth rate slipping to 6 percent in 2020 is justified because by then diseases will be at their peak in the financial system
 yani ki aarthik growth ke maamle main 2019 main ham shaayad vahiin khadey honge 2014 main jahaan se chale the

 com / nppfvg6f9u Apple, a world-renowned company, may soon start manufacturing iphones and ipads in India
 bharat sarkaar or america company appal ke bich beete do maheene se baatcheet jari he
 Apple is coming to India demanding that it be given a big discount under Prime Minister Modi's dream project 'make in India' program so that he can set up his unit here at the earliest
 
 Why Apple wants to come to India Earlier this year, Apple KCEO Tim Cook said during his visit to India that India is the biggest market in the world for him
 lihaaja vah jald se jald bharat main appal exclusive ritel showrooms kholana chaahate hai
 The country's retail law states that to open an exclusive retail showroom by a foreign company, 30% of the product has to be sourced from the Indian market
 yah kanoon videshi company par teen saal ke liye lagu rahegaa lekin appal ke liye yah niyam paanch saal tak lagu rahegaa
 Therefore, Apple is compelled to capture such a huge market of smartphones to manufacture its products in India
 mek in india se appal ko ummidamek in india kaarykram ke tahat bharat sarkaar videshi companiyon kobharat main manuphaccharing unitalgane ke liye kai riyaayaten detii he
 These include special duty structures as well as zero duty on all the parts imported
 haalanki mobile or anya gajet kii deshi-videshi companiyon ko yah chhot adeptor, bydaree or hedset emport karne par nahin di jaati he
 Apple says that its adapters, batteries and headsets are the world's cutting edge technologies
 lihaaja bharat main appal phone or ypad kii manuphaccharing karne ke aivaj main in products ko aayaat karne ke saath-saath duty main chhot di jaae
 Make in India under Apple's expectation in India program: The central government is trying to make the country the manufacturing hub of the world
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki appal duniya kaa ek behtareen brands he
 If it has a manufacturing unit in India, then the brand of Made in India will make the flag of Make in India worldwide
 lihaaja, iske liye jaruri he ki appal apane yphone or ypad kii puri manuphaccharing bharat main kare jisase desh ke manuphaccharing sector ko appal kii kating age technology se sidhaa phayda ho
 By bringing this technology of quality battery, headset and adapter to India, the R&D of these products will benefit mobile manufacturing in the country
 saath hi kating age technology vaale products kii keemat bhartiya bazaar main antarrashtriya bazaar se kam rahegi
 That is, the iphone and ipad will be found relatively cheap in the country
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke saath photo vaale vigyaapan ko lekar vivaadon ke ghere main aaye gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ne kendra sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki vah bhaajapa shasit rajyon ke saath sautela bartaav kar rahi he
 In a resolution presented by the bjp's national executive, Modi alleged that the UPA government was defying the Sarkaria Commission's recommendations on center-state relations
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kendra rajyapalon or ucch nyaayalayon ke mukhya nyaayadhishon kii niyukti main bhaajapa shasit rajyon se salaah mashvira nahin kar rahi he
 Modi said that many Bills passed by the Gujarat Legislative Assembly with a two-thirds majority have been kept in cold storage by the Governor or Center for the last six years
 unhone kaha, ‘‘yah desh ke sangheey dhaanche ko kamjor karne ke liye jaan-boojhkar kiya ja rahaa prayaas he
 BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy told reporters here that the party's national executive has authorized Modi to prepare a report in this regard in consultation with the chief ministers of bjp-ruled states
 team india srilankai sarajameen par 22 saal main pehali baar test siries jeetne ke iraade se buudhvaar ko jab mejabaan team ke khilaaf teen maichon kii siries main utregi to captain viraat kohli kii paanch visheshgy gendbaajon ke saath utarane kii aakraamak ranneeti kii bhi pariksha hogi
 Kohli's real fire was Mahendra Singh Dhoni Sekohali who got the responsibility of the Test team in Sydney and India also played the only Test in Bangladesh after that but this is Kohli's first full series as captain
 kohli pehle hi aakraamak captaini kaa vaada kar chuke hai or 20 wicket lene kii kavayad main vah test match main paanch gendbaajon ke saath utrenge
 India will come down with 5 bowlers! Kohli led the team in Adelaide after Dhoni was injured for the first time
 bharat yah match 42 ran se haar gaya lekin kohli kii captaini kii kaaphi tarif hui or unhone donon pariyon main shatak bhi maare
 He landed with five bowlers at Fatullah in Bangladesh and also the return of legendary spinner Harbhajan Singh in the team
 agar practice match or practice seshan par gaur karen to lagata he ki aagaamee siries main bhi kohli kii yah ranneeti barkaraar rahegi
 Lokesh Rahul to be replaced by Murali Vijay: Playing in 11, Murali Vijay has been ruled out of the first Test due to a hamstring strain and in such a situation Kohli will have an easy option to give young Lokesh Rahul a chance
 ballebaaji kii baat karen to ajinkya rahane kii paanchaven sthaan par jagah pakki he
 Rohit Sharma, Kohli and Wriddhiman Saha did not appear in rhythm at all in the practice match
 in sabhi ko haalanki kharaab form main kahana jaldbaaji hoga kyonki ye lambey brake ke baad khel rahe hai
 Kohli's Test form was tremendous when Australia batted brilliantly for four centuries in the Test series
 lekin iske baad se simit overon ke maichon main vah prabhavi pradarshan nahin kar paae
 He made his World Cup debut with a century against Pakistan
 pakistan ke khilaaf match se pehle hue chaar vanade maichon main vah dohare ank main bhi nahin pahunch paae jabaki iske baad 10 maichon main unka sarvaadhik score 46 ran rahaa
 In the absence of Team India chief coach upset over Rohit, Kohli can be seen keeping an eye on the team during practice with team director Ravi Shastri and this is a sign of his staying in touch with the young team
 middle order main kohli par adhik nirbharta haalanki mehmaan team ke liye chintaa kii baat he
 There is a lack of consistency in Rohit Sharma's performance and this can also be a cause for concern for the team as a batsman like Cheteshwar Pujara has to sit out of the playing eleven in his presence
 amit kaa plaing ilevan main shaamil hona mushkilkohli ke sanket ko dekhte hue bhartiya prabandhan virdohi team ke 20 wicket chatakaane ke liye paanch gendbaajon ke saath utar saktaa he
 According to the weather forecast, it will be cloudy and rainy throughout the week, so it is expected that three spinners are not selected in the team
 srilanka aane ke baad se leg spinner amit mishra ne bhi halkaa abhyaas hi kiya he
 When it got sunny on the pitch on Monday, it was showing signs of getting dry and in such a situation, Team India can get down with three fast bowlers
 eshanth, umesh or varun kii tikdikohli kii nazren tej gati se gendbaaji par tiki hai or aise main umesh yadav or varun aaron ko eshanth sharma ke saath utaara ja saktaa he
 Shastri also relied on the lower-order pair of Ravichandran Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh
 kohli kii aguai vaali team 1993 ke baad srilanka main pehali baar test siries jatine ke lakshya ke saath utregi
 Sri Lanka were then beaten 1-0 by the Mohammad Azharuddin-led team
 sangakaara honge sabase badi chunautibharat kii jeet ke bich main sabase badirukawat anbhavi kumaar sangakarahonge jo colombo main duusare test ke baad sanyas kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 The Sri Lankan team, however, will be under pressure after their 1-2 loss to Pakistan in the previous series
 pakistan siries ke dauraan team main badlaav kiye gaye or is baar bhi aisa hi hua he, visheshkar gendbaaji vibhaag main choton ke kaaran
 The poor form of Sri Lankan batsmen Shaminda Eranga and Suranga Lakmal are not part of the team, while the fitness of Dushmanta Chameera has also been questioned
 srilanka ke gendbaaji akraman kii aguai dhammika prasad karenge jabaki unka saath padaarpan kii aas lagaae baithe vishwa furnando de sakate hai
 Left-arm fast bowler Fernando took two wickets for 17 runs in the second innings of the practice match against India
 rangana herath, dilaruvaan perera or tharindu kaushal spin vibhaag main jimmedaari sanbhaalenge lekin team kii ballebaaji captain angelo maithyuj ke liye sabase badi chintaa kii baat he
 Expectations from Kaushal Silva Kayamkithuruwan Vithange have been dropped from the squad while Lahiru Thirimane managed to save his place despite playing 5 and 18 runs in the practice match
 kushal perera or upul tharanga bhi practice match main khele jisamen tharanga ne duusari pari main ardhashatak banaaya
 Opener Kaushal Silva was also not out after playing 160 balls and if he repeats this form, the pressure on Sangakkara and Mathews will come down
 timen is prakaar hai-bharat-viraat kohli, shikhar dhawan, murali vijay, lokesh rahul, rohit sharma, cheteshwar pujaara, ajinkya rahane, riddhimaan saaha, ravichandran aswin, harbhajan singh, amit mishra, eshanth sharma, bhubaneshwar kumaar, umesh yadav or varuna aaron

 When asked about the alleged mobilization of airlines to increase air fares, Ravi said that Patel had taken drastic steps on such complaints
 unhone kaha, ‘main unke kadamon par chaluungaa or is tarah kii chijen nahin hone duungaa

 What is the situation in Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly? iske alaava unki bhavisht kii ranneeti kya he ye bhi dekhnaa hoga? shashikala ne ise diemke kii sajeesh bataaya he
 Conspiracy angle? Sasikala has been continuously suspected by party leaders over Jayalalithaa's death
 aise main party ke kaaryakartaaon main sanshay kii sthiti he
 However, Sasikala claimed that all the leaders and activists are with her
 duusari ore panniraselvam kaa kahana he ki ve party main hai or rahenge or koi unhen party se nikaal nahin saktaa
 This is likely to lead to direct confrontation
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki party ke vidhayakon kii lamabandi kiski taraf hoti he
 Panneerselvam's image of a close friend of Amma may have been considered close to Jayalalithaa, but everyone in the political corridor is clearly aware that whenever Jayalalithaa was caught in trouble, Panneerselvam would take over as CM
 jayalalita ke jaale jane yaa phir aspataal main bhartee hone ke vakt panniraselvam ne hi siem kii kursi sanbhali thi or phir baahar aate hi jaiyalalita ko satta saunp di thi
 In such a situation, the sympathy of the party workers can remain with Panneerselvam
 duusari ore shashikala kaa cor political becoground nahin dikhataa
 After Jayalalithaa's death, she suddenly appeared and became the party general secretary and was now going on to take up the post of CM
 shashikala kii kamjor kadisiem pad par tajposhi se pehle vivaadon main ai shashikala ke liye ek or mushkil he

 a petition has also been filed in the Supreme Court in this case
 is maamle ko lekar bhi shashikala ke khilaaf panniraselvam ko party main samarthan bad saktaa he

 apane nivas, mumbai ke 'matoshri' ke bhootal kii baithak main, uddhav thakare kii mej par ek safed acrelic stand par ankit he, 'mujhe ve log pasand hai jo koi kaam puraa karke dikhaane kaa madda rakhte hai
 'this is the essence of the thinking of the Shiv Sena chief
 jab 1995 main pehali baar shivasena-bhaajapa sarkaar satta main ai thi, to balasaheb thakare ke teen putron main sabase chote uddhav, jo ab 59 varsh ke hai, vanyajeev photography ke apane junun main hi bahut khush the
 Whenever the party workers were urged to speak calmly and coyly, they pointed to their charismatic cousin Raj
 haalanki, 1996 main unke sabase bade bhai bindumadhav kii sadak durghatana main mrityu ho gai, to uddhav apane pita ke saath matoshri main rahane aa gaye, jahaan duusare bhai jayadev kii patni smita thakare kii chalati thi
 By the way, Uddhav's interest in politics started only in 1999, when the Shiv sena-bjp alliance lost to the congress-nationalist Congress Party alliance
 agle paanch varshon main, ve balasaheb ke chune hue vaaris ke rup main ubhare or unhen 2003 main party kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh niyukt kiya gaya
 Uddhav may have been shy and soft-spoken, but his views were very clear
 ve shivasena ke punarnirmaan ko taiyaar the, taaki vah huddangiyon kii party kii bajaay, samaveshi vikaas main vishwaas rakhane vaali party ke rup main jaani jaae
 In 2003, Uddhav launched a campaign called 'me Mumbaikar', aimed at involving people of all religions and regions in the development of Mumbai
 unhone shivasena netaaon or kader ke bich apni sweekaaryata ko badhaane ke liye rajya bhraman shuru kiya
 This became a matter of dispute between him and Raj, who wanted to keep Uddhav away from their areas of Thane, Pune and Nashik
 usee dauraan uddhav ne party main apane adhikaar kaa daawa karte hue purv mukhyamantri narayan rane ko apana aadesh maanane ke liye dawaab bananaa shuru kar diya
 Both Rane and Raj quit the Shiv Sena in 2005
 biimaar hone ke kaaran balasaheb ne matoshri se baahar nikalnaa band kar diya or 2007 ke ant tak uddhav thakare ne party ko puri tarah apane niyantran main le liya
 "uddhav freed the gang of extortionists"
 Balasaheb uttered the same words in praise of his son
 party or brihanmumbai mahanagarapalika (biemasi) par purna niyantran ke saath, uddhav ne shahar ke liye apane drushtikon ko lagu karnaa shuru kar diya
 Instead of laying pipelines to carry drinking water, they built tunnels and set up three pumping stations to protect the city from the monsoon floods
 yah alag baat he ki ye stesan tabhi kargar sabit hote hai jab barish madhyam str kii hoti he or jab bhi shahar main baadh aati he to uddhav or biemasi aalochana kaa vishay ban jate hai
 Since 2009, Uddhav has been raising the debt waiver of farmers in Maharashtra
 jab sharad pavaar bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ke adhyaksh the, to uddhav ne ipiel main din or raat ke maichon kii anumati dene ke liye yah kehete hue unki aalochana kii ki kisaan raat main bijli paane ke liye jujh rahe hai or match ke liye bijli di ja rahi he
 When asked about his vision for agriculture, his reply was, "I do not know about farming but i know how to reduce the sufferings of farmers
