 ) The new Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar is known for his simplicity and clear speech
 unki baton main koi chal yaa daanvpench nahin dikhataa
 In Aaj Tak's Agenda 2014 program, he spoke with simplicity and also showed a glimpse of the government's policy
 unhone saaf jataa diya ki ve kuch karke dikhaanaa chaahate hai
 He is sensitive to the defense of the country and does not want to leave any stone unturned in this
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki pakistan kii harkaton kaa jawaab acchhee tarah diya jayega lekin hamen iskaa hal dhundhana hi hoga
 That is, he wants that on the one hand, India should continue to give strong response to Pakistan for its wrong antics, while also finding avenues for long-term peace
 yah baat pate kii he kyonki har samajhadaar vyakti jaanata he ki bandook kaa jawaab to bandook se diya ja saktaa he lekin do padosiyon ke bich yah niti hameshaa kargar nahin ho sakati
 Finally, a better relationship with the neighbor has to be done
 raksha mantri kaa desh ke sipaahiyon kii jaruraton ko samajhnaa or unke liye kuch kar dikhaane kii bhaavana rakhana ek badi baat he
 Generally, the Defense Minister talks about weapons and ammunition, but does not talk about their primary facilities like shoes, etc
 jab siachin main pakistan ne hamalaa kiya or kai jagahon par kabja kar liya to pataa chalaa tha ki hamaare sipaahiyon ke paas utani oonchai par ladane ke liye na to garm kapade hai or na hi juute
 It was very disappointing and for that reason our Jaban soldiers had to face a lot of trouble
 lekin vartmaan raksha mantri is maamle main samvedansheel dikhte hai
 They feel that our soldiers have a huge shortage of ammunition and equipment which needs to be fulfilled but at the same time their basic needs cannot be neglected
 unka yah kahana ki raksha ke saamaanon ke saude main lage agenton ko vaidhaniktaa pradaan kii jaae bilkul sahi he
 This will bring transparency in the deals and there will be no allegations of kickbacks
 usase bhi badi baat yah hogi ki ve hathiyaaron kii kharid varshon tak nahin lataki rahegi
 Another thing that Manohar Parrikar likes is that he has no qualms about his qualification or degree
 yah aaj ke sandarbh main bahut badi baat he kyonki amuman bade padon par asin log apni yogyata yaa degree ke bare main bahut dambhi ho jate hai
 His statement about defense deals and arms production is correct
 unhen pataa he ki inamen jaldbaaji nahin ho sakati he
 They want that whatever is bought is better and is in need
 ham ummid kar sakate hai ki manohar parrikar ke kaarykaal main desh ke raksha mantralay main amul-chul badlaav aayega kyonki yahaan ab soch badal gai he

 rigerv bank or anya sarkari bainkon se sabase zyada karj desh main kendra sarkaar or rajya sarkarein leti hai
 Therefore, the reduction in the repo rate will now allow the central and state governments to get loans at cheaper rates, so that they can start the investment process in infra and other sectors
 desh main sarkaar ke baad duusare number par sabase bada karj lene vaali badi sarkari or nijee companiyaan he
 Getting loans at cheap interest rates will make it easier for these companies to expand themselves
 inhen sasti daron par milane vaala karj desh main kaarobaari teji laane ke liye behad ahm rahata he
 The major benefit of this decision of the Reserve Bank will be the weak and weak companies in the country
 ab aisi companiyon ke liye sasti dar par karj lekar company ko ek baar phir se majboot karne kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 With this deduction, such companies will try to infuse companies by taking loans from banks

 At the same time, the expense of benefiting the seventh pay commission to the central and state employees was a big challenge for the governments

 Also read: Urjit Patel finally lowered the interest rate due to these reasons
 Finally, due to the availability of loans at cheaper rates, the common man gets a big relief
 aam aadmi dwaara home lone, personal lone ityadi sasti daron par uplabdh ho jaati he
 At the same time, the EMI of the people who have already taken loan gets cut, which also makes it easier for them to discharge their debt

 input bhashaa se Pranab Mukherjee has finally won the presidential election in the midst of all the political drama
 pranab mukherjee 25 july ko raashtrapati pad kii shapath lenge
 Pranab Mukherjee has been elected the 13th President of the country
 unako 7 lakh 13 hajaar 763 mat mulya mili, jabaki bijepi samarthit pratidwandvi pie sangama ko maatr 3 lakh 15 hajaar 987 mat mulya hasil hue
 The victory of 76-year-old Pranab Mukherjee, a UPA candidate, was already considered almost certain and he was 69
 3 pratishat mat mili, jabaki unke pratidwandvi sangama ko 31 pratishat mat mili
 This election saw a rift in both the NDA and the Left Front
 sangama ko karnataka ke bhaajapa vidhayakon kii cross voting kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jabaki jadyu, shivasena jaise rajg ke ghatak pehle hi mukherjee ko samarthan kii ghoshnaa kar chuke the
 The Left Front constituents also held different opinions in these elections
 apane samarthakon ke bich ‘dada’ ke naam se pukaare jane vaale pranab mukherjee desh ke is sheersh pad par pahunchane vaale pashchim bengal se pehle netaa hai
 He will be sworn in by Chief Justice of India SH Kapadia at 11 am on July 25 in the Central Hall of Parliament
 maujuuda raashtrapati pratibha devisingh patil ko 1000 sainikon kii salaami ke saath buudhvaar 25 july ko vidaai di jaaegi or pranab ke raashtrapati pad kii shapath lene ke baad vahi 1000 sainik apane naye ‘mukhya senapati’ ko salaami denge
 Congratulating Pranab for his victory, Sangma has indicated that he may challenge these results in the court
 adivasee card khel rahe sangama ko unke kshetra purvottar ke rajyon se bhi niraashaa haath lagi he
 After being elected the next President of the country, Pranab today said that he is grateful to everyone for the support he received from all over the country
 apane awaas ke baahar samvaadadaataaon se unhone kaha, ‘puure desh se mujhe jabardast samarthan mila he jiske liye main sabhi kaa abhaari hum
 Pranab said that it will be his responsibility as President to preserve and protect the Constitution
 sangama dwaara badhai diye jane kii khabar par pranav ne kaha ki vah sangama kaa bhi dhanyavad karte hai
 Out of 776 mps, 748 exercised their franchise in the elections held on 19th of this month, out of which 527 voted for Pranab and 206 for Sangma
 sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav sahit 15 saansadon ke mat ayogy qaraar diye gayi
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and party general secretary Rahul Gandhi greeted Pranab da at his existing residence at 13 Talkatora Road, shortly after Pranab announced his magic figure for victory
 badhai dene waalon main kai raajnneetik dal, saansad, vidhayak, kendriya mantri, pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee, jammu kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla, uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav, sapa pramukh mulaayam singh yadav aadi shaamil the
 Pranab's son Abhijeet Mukherjee said on his father's victory, "he (pranab) had confidence in his victory from the beginning and would prove his role as president
 unhen is baat kaa afsos nahin he ki vah pradhanmantri nahin ban paye lekin ab vah raashtrapati bane hai jo samaan rup se or sanvaidhanik rup se sarvocch pad he
 'dictionary of politics capable of understanding the fabric of India and Indianness with full readiness and parkiness, a troubleshooter recognized in the corridors of power, administrator and conductor of the party across the borders of Pranab Kumar Mukherjee will be seen as a pleasant signal to elect the President of the country
 
 daleey simaaon se pare unki swakaaryata ne hi vipakshi gathbandhan rajg main raag dwesh khadey kiye or jad-you shivasena jaise dhur virdohi unke samarthan main najar aaye
 And when even the most ardent opponents like Arun Jaitley start comparing him to cricket warrior Sir Dan Bradman, then it is a satisfaction that the top constitutional post of the first citizen in the country and the position of its supreme commander are really capable and in good hands
 raashtrapati pad kii daud main shuruuaat se hi kai utaar chadhaav dekhne ko mili
 The Trinamool Congress, a major constituent of the UPA, finally gave support to Pranab's candidature after a lot of trouble
 udhar rajg ke ghatak jadyu or shivasena ne bhi mukherjee kaa samarthan kiya
 Even though Pranab da had to face PA Sangma in the name of protest for mere opposition, his experience had convinced him long before victory
 tabhi to unhone ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki unhen raashtrapati bhawan kaa lon kaaphi pasand he
 'I have a habit of walking in the morning
 main apane lon main 30-40 chakkar lagaataa hum
 The lawn of Rashtrapati Bhavan is quite large
 kisi ko itane chakkar lagane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 He was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1969

 He turned to the Lok Sabha after nearly 35 years in political life
 2004 main vah pehali baar pashchim bengal ke jangipur sansadeey kshetra se chune gaye

 Insiders say that his return came because Dawood wanted to hand over the responsibility of his business in Mumbai to a family member

 supreme court ne elahabaad hoicourt ke faisle ke khilaaf uttar pradesh sarkaar kii yachika par sunwaayee karte hue surendra coli or centre sarkaar ko notice bhejkar jawaab maanga he
 The High Court had commuted the death sentence of Surender Koli, convicted in the 2006 Nithari case, to life imprisonment on the basis of 'excessive delay' in deciding mercy petition
 supreme court main sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne upi sarkaar kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki coli ko faansee di jaani chahie
 The Central Government will also file a petition against the High Court's decision in this matter
 upi sarkaar ne supreme court main kaha ki coli kaa faisla karne main teen saal kaa vakt laga or ise atyadhik deree nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The comments isliye hoicourt ke faisle ko radd kiya janaa chahie
 Earlier, the High Court had said in its judgment that execution of Koli's death sentence would be 'unconstitutional' in view of the 'excessive delay' in deciding the mercy petition
 adaalat ne gaiyr sarkari sanghathan ‘pipuls union for democratic ritis’ (piudiar) kii janhit yachika par yah faisla sunaaya tha
 This organization had argued that it took 'three years and three months' to settle Koli's mercy petition and in such a situation, execution of his death sentence would violate the right to live life given in Article 21 of the Constitution
 baad main coli ne khud bhi ek yachika daayar karke is janhit yachika main die gaye aadhaar par hi maut kii sajaa ko chunauti di thi or is donon yachikaaon ko natthi kar diya gaya tha
 During the hearing in the Supreme Court, the central government supported the UP government and said that Koli should be hanged
 is maamle main hycourt ke faisle ke khilaaf centre sarkaar bhi yachika daakhil karegi
 The UP government said in the Supreme Court that it took three years to decide Koli and it cannot be called excessive delay
 tippaniyan Hence the High Court's decision should be quashed
 isse pehle hoicourt ne apane nirnay main kaha tha ki coli kii dayaa yachika par faisle main ‘atyadhik deree ko dekhte hue’ uski maut kii sajaa par amal ‘asanvaidhanik’ hoga
 The court gave the ruling on a PIL filed by the NGO 'people's Union for Democratic Rights' (PUDR)
 is sanghathan ne daleel di thi ki coli kii dayaa yachika ke nibatare main ‘teen saal or teen maheene’ kaa samay laga or aisi sthiti main uski maut kii sajaa par amal samvidhan ke anuchhed 21 main die gaye jivan jeene ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan hoga
 Later, Koli himself filed a petition challenging the death penalty on the basis of this PIL and both these petitions were filed
 isliye hoicourt ke faisle ko radd kiya janaa chahie

 He recently played the character in the film 'mohenjo Daro'
 pesh he unase hui baatcheet ke mukhya ansh:jab bhi bhagwan krishna kaa zikr hota he to aapkaa hi cheharaa logon ke saamne aata he?bhagwaan kii dayaa he, maa bhagwati kii krupa he ki hamen us team ke saath kaam karne kaa ek aisa avasar mila jo apane apane kshetra ke diggaj the
 i give the credit for the success of 'mahabharata' to all of them
 25 saal ke baadabhi log ise bhul nahin paae hai
 When during the 'mahabharata' you were asked to play the role of 'shri Krishna' on screen, what was going on in your mind at that time? i did not see any film related to 'shri Krishna'
 us jamaane main maharashtra main 'sahu modak' sahab ko log 'shri krishna' ke naam se jaanate the kyonki wo kai baar unka role nibhaayaa karte the
 i did not watch his movies
 phir marathi sahitya kii padhai karke, bahut sari kitaaben pard-pard kar, mahabharat ke 18 khando ko padhakar, shooting karne chalaa jaataa tha
 My interest in literature worked for this
 'ugant' or 'dhyasaparv' jaisi kitaaben bhi padhi
 Used to prepare a lot
 marathi sahitya ne mere bheetar kaa 'shri krishna' khadaa kiya
 You also worked in 'mohenjo Daro'? Yes, my work was as 'durjan' which makes Hrithik Roshan's character bigger than Pal Pos
 kaam karnaa acha laga
 Nowadays you are doing less films? i got busy doing different things a little bit
 madhya pradesh main paryaton ke vikaas kaa kaam kar rahaa tha
 Was busy in photography, writing books, doing plays
 saath hi pichley 3-4 maheene mere marathi film banane main nikal gaye the jaska naam tha 'pitr rin'
 So these were the reasons for not doing the projects
 hamane ek or film 'yaksha' kii he or pichley kuch maheenon se apane agle project par kaam kar rahaa hum jo ek byopic hogi
 So will the Gods not do the role now? If the project comes, i will, but now the time has come to play Human Emotion on the screen instead of God Emotion
 or isiilie kuch alag tarah ke project kar rahaa hum
 Now i will do more films
 aap aaj bhi itane yang kaise lagate hai?maine apni jivan style bahut hi saral or sahaj rakhi he
 i do not consume cigarettes, alcohol and non-veg
 swimming, tennis or walk karata hum
 i eat at one time, i also eat more fruit in it
 lekin meri ek hi kamajori he namakeen or pakode
 Not only this, i only take Ayurvedic medicines
 ab kisi scripts aap karnaa chahenge?harscriptjo mujhe actor ke rup main chalange kare
 Recently, the character of 'alia Bhatt' came in, but it was not challenging, so i did not think it was right to do
 parformens bahut jaruri he
 People have not seen me on screen doing comedy but you know that there was naughtyness in Krishna's role as well
 isiilie mujhe wo role mila tha
 i want to do a comedy film
 aap khud ko dharmik muddon par bayaanbaji se bachaa kar rakhte hai?meraa maananaa he ki har cheez main har kisi kaa bolnaa aavashyak nahin hota
 Some issues are not solved by speaking in the media, just some publicity is gained
 mujhe kisi dharmik mudde par bolnaa hota he to main usase sambandhit vyakti ko chitthee likh diya karata hum
 i am a slightly restrained kind of person
 filmein dekhte hai?mujhe kai sari filmein acchhee lageen
 Both Dum Lagaake Haisha, 'madari', 'kapoor and Sons' and Salman Khan's films 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' and 'sultan' looked good
 mujhe bahut acha lag rahaa he ki salmaan ab bahut acchhee scripts chun rahe hai
 i am a person of the industry and it is important to keep the news
 byopic kaa jamaana he?abhinayta ke taur par byopic jarur karnaa chaahunga
 But right now i am working on a period film
 dobaaraa politics main aana chahenge?agle pachaas varsh to nahin kyonki maine ye janaa ki jo main politics ke madhyam se karnaa chaah rahaa tha, wo to main filmon ke madhyam se bhi kar saktaa hum
 And i would like to work in the interest of society with the popularity of films
 har insaan mujhe yahi kahata he ki aap politics main mat jaaie

 After West Bengal, BJP has now started focusing on the Northeast

 In the meeting, Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju, Manipur Chief Minister N
 biren singh, tripura ke siem biplab deb, arunachal pradesh ke mukhyamantri prem khandu, bijepi netaa hemanth vishwasharma maujuud the
 Also, Ram Madhav is also attending the meeting
 shah purvottar ke saat rajyon ke bijepi ke pradesh adhyakshon ke saath bhi baithak karenge
 This meeting can last night
 manipurabijepi ne amit shaahake joardaar swaagat kii taiyaari kii he, jahaan purvottar ke sabhi mukhyamantriyon or party ke sabhi netaaon se mulaakaat kaa kaarykram tay he
 The electoral strategy is likely to be discussed in the meeting of the Northeast Parliamentary Committee in view of the 2019 general elections
 gauratlab he ki purvottar ke adhiktar rajyon main pichley do varshon main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main jeet hasil kii he
 Abbeijphere is focusing its attention on wowing the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ne sabase pehle assam main satta kaayam kii
 He then succeeded in forming governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya
 yah alag baat he ki bijepi ne kahin khud ke dam par sarkaar banaaya to kahin dusron kaa sahaara liya
 The BJP is now focusing its attention on Mizoram, the only Christian majority state where the BJP is not ruled
 bhagava party loksabhaa chunaavon ke liye purvottar main aakraamak tareeke se kaam kar rahi he taaki desh ke kisi hisse main hue chunavi nuksaan kii bharpai vah is kshetra se kar sake
 West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC chief Mamta Banerjee is on a tour of Delhi and here she is engaged in the exercise of the Third Front
 is kadi main mamata ne mangalvaar ko vibhinn dalon ke netaaon se mulaakaat bhi kii
 Mamta not only met the leaders of opposition parties, but also certain leaders of Congress and BJP are also meeting Mamata
 agle loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or pradhanmantri narendra modi se mukaable ke liye mamata banerjee ne fedral front khadaa karne kii baat kahi he or inhen koshishon ke maddenjar mamata ne ensipi, shivasena, tiares, tidipi, argedy or sapa ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii he
 But what effect these meetings will have on the upcoming elections can be understood from the position of various parties
 TRS-TMC kaa gathjodfedral front kaa vichaar sabase pehle 19 march ko mamata banerjee or TRS pramukh ke chandrashekhar raav ke bich baatcheet ke dauraan saamne aayaa tha
 The TRS chief and the Telangana Chief Minister had spoken to Mamata about keeping the Congress away for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections and setting up a Federal Front
 aise main tiares or tiemasi 2019 ke liye ek manch par aa sakate hai
 Suspense with NCP, NCP chief Sharad Pawar met in Delhi
 upie se alag hone ke baad ensipi kai rajyon main congress ke khilaaf vidhansabha chunaav lard chuki he
 In such a situation, it is possible that in the 2019 elections, Mamata and Sharad Pawar's party came together against both BJP and Congress camps
 tidipi kii naaraazgi kaa phaydatidipi saansad or purv kendriya mantri vaai es choudhary ne bhi mamata banerjee se mulaakaat kii he
 The TDP, which was part of the NDA, has withdrawn support to the government on the demand for special status for Andhra and has been continuously stirring against the government in the House
 bijepi se tidipi kii naaraazgi kaa phayda is fedral front ko mil saktaa he kyonki tidipi bijepi se zyaadaandhra ke bantwaare ke liecongress ko doshi maanati ai he
 Angry with both camps, the TDP may also go with the Third Front
 shivasena ke bagawati surandie sarkaar main shaamil shivasena lagaataar modi sarkaar par hamale kar rahi he lekin bijepi ke khilaaf chunaav lade isaki sambhaavna kam hai
 Today in Delhi, there was a meeting between Mamta and Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut
 party 2019 main endie se alag hokar chunaav ladane kaa elaan kar chuki he lekin pashchim bengal main mamata kii chhavi ko shivasena kii vichaardhaara shaayad hi hajam kar paae
 The sp-bsp's support is enough to benefit any ally of the SP-BSP who have joined Uttar Pradesh politics
 beete upachunaav main gathbandhan ne majbootee to dikhaai he lekin akhilesh yadav kaa congress prem bhi kisi se chipa nahin he
 non-congress Morcha will get the support of SP, it seems a bit difficult
 saath hi agle chunaav main upi main sapa acha karti he to akhilesh khud kisi kheme main na jaakar apana khemaa banane kii koshish bhi kar sakate hai
 Will talk to RJD? RJD MP Misa Bharti has also met Mamata Banerjee
 misa ke pita lalu yadav kai manchon se mamata se bijepi ke khilaaf saath aane kii apil to kar chuke hai lekin unke gathbandhan main hameshaa congress shaamil rahi he
 In such a situation, it will be difficult for the Congress-led alliance to join Lalu's party RJD as both parties have been allies of power in Bihar
 mamata banerjee dilli main gaiyr bijepi or gaiyr kangrasi morche kii kavayad main to juty hai lekin chunaav aate-aate sameekaran badal sakate hai
 At the same time, even after the election, depending on the results, the fellow camp can also change and come into the camp

 aise main jis mudde par party main antarvirodh bana he us par party ke mantri kuch nahin bol rahe hai
 It is important to note that with the current loan waiver, the state government will benefit 31 lakh farmers by spending about Rs
 30 thousand crores
 agar shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare ke hath ko sweekaar karen to madad raashi pahonchegi ek lakh 34 hajaar karod rupye tak, jo kisi rajya ke liye vyavhaarik nahin he
 Talking to agitating peasant leaders on Sunday, the Maharashtra government has decided that it immediately forgives the loans of small farmers and approves the loan waivers of the rest of the farmers in an element
 raaoot ne kaha he ki aisa faisla uddhav thakare ko nagavar he
 They want to see the debt of all the farmers in the state waived
 chaunkaane vaali baat he ki, is bayaanbazi se shivasena kaa antarvirodh khulkar saamne aayaa he
 While Uddhav Thackeray's family is abroad, many party leaders are broadcasting different statements citing Uddhav Thackeray on the same issue
 party pravaktaa or maharashtra vidhaan parishad kii sadsy neelam go he ne daawa kiya tha ki, kisaan kaa bahikhaata khaali arthath karjmukt karne ke sarkaar ke faisle kaa shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare ne swaagat kiya he
 What was less was that Mrs Go He also gave public greetings to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and many other BJP ministers
 tippaniyan But the surprising thing was more
 kisaan andolankariyon se baatcheet ke liye jis samiti kaa mukhyamantri fadanvis ne gathan kiya he us samiti main shivasena ke varisht netaa or rajya ke parivahan mantri divakar ravate ko shaamil kiya gaya he

 30 thousand crores
 agar shivasena party pramukh uddhav thakare ke hath ko sweekaar karen to madad raashi pahonchegi ek lakh 34 hajaar karod rupye tak, jo kisi rajya ke liye vyavhaarik nahin he
 Shockingly, the contradiction of the Shiv Sena has come to the fore with this statement
 uddhav thakare ke sapariwaar videsh main hone ke dauraan party ke kai netaa ek hi mudde par uddhav thakare ke hawaale se alag-alag bayaan prasaarit kar rahe hai
 Party spokesperson and Maharashtra Legislative Council member Neelam Go He claimed that the government's decision to free the farmer's bookkeeping, ie debt-free, was welcomed by Shiv Sena party chief Uddhav Thackeray
 yahi kya kam tha ki shrimati go he ne mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis samet bijepi ke kai anya mantriyon kaa saarvajanik abhinandan bhi kiya
 The comments lekin achraj bhari baat or bhi thi
 The committee, constituted by Chief Minister Fadnavis, has included senior Shiv Sena leader and state transport minister Diwakar Rawate for talks with farmer agitators
 karzmaafi se jude jo bhi faisle hue us prakriya main ravate shaamil the
 In such a situation, the party minister is not talking about the issue on which there is a contradiction in the party
 gauratlab he ki maujuuda karzmaafi se rajya sarkaar kareeb 30 hajaar karod rupee kharch kar 31 lakh kisaanon ko labhanvit karegi
 If the Shiv Sena accepts the stubbornness of the party chief Uddhav Thackeray, the amount of help will reach one lakh 34 thousand crore rupees, which is not practical for any state

 Public sector (PSU) banks were criticized in this light for their inefficiency, corruption and lack of autonomy as they were more prone to fall into the clutches of capitalism (crony capitalism)
 
 vahiin duusari taraf nijee bainkon ko kushalta, graahak kendrit najariye or shairdharakon ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhane ke ucch pratimaan sthapit karne or baari munafa kamaane waalon ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha
 ceos of private banks were always prevalent in events associated with industry organizations
 unki ginati 'taqatvar logon' main hoti thi or unka vetan unhen atyadhik sampann logon kii fehrist main shumaar karata tha
 So, when policy-makers started looking for the crisis in PSU banks, some people advised them that they should be privatized to improve their condition
 ab jaraa maujuuda haal par aa jaaie

 ICICI, India's second largest private bank with consolidated assets of Rs
 is nirantar gahraate sankat ke kaaran nijee kshetra ke bank bhi utane hi badahaal najar aa rahe hai jitne ki saarvajanik kshetra ke bank
 What was previously seen as an issue of corporate governance in the bank is now seen as the weakest link contained in the private banking structure
 ab sheersh nijee bainkon (isiisiaai bank, exis bank) kii tulana bhi saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon se kii jane lagi he or nijee bainkon ke sheersh adhikari bhi ab nijee agenciyon kii jaanch ke daayre main aa gaye hai
 Monitoring notices have been issued to airports against several prominent people in the ICICI Bank case
 inamen isiisiaai bank kii emdi va siio chanda kochar ke pati deepak kochar, deepak ke bhai rajeev kochar or videokon samooh ke chairman venugopal dhoot shaamil hai
 This has made it the most sensational case of recent times
 isiisiaai bank ke board par is baat ke liye dabaav bad gaya he ki vah hiton ke takaraav or len-dein ke maamalon kii swatantra jaanch karaae
 For this reason, experts are again arguing that privatization is not the solution to all the problems in the banking sector
 desh main saarvajanik kshetra ke 22 bank hai, nijee kshetra ke 34 or 44 videshi bank hai
 However, most of the loans and advances (69 per cent in December 2017) have been given by PSU banks
 uske baad nijee kshetra ke bainkon (27 fisadi) or videshi bainkon (4 fisadi) kaa number aata he
 Currently, Launch is not only on ICICI Bank
 bhartiya rigerv bank ne exis bank ke board se bhi yah kaha he ki bank main badhate duubat karj kii chintaaon ke maddenjar vah shikha sharma ko chauthe kaarykaal ke liye emdi va siio niyukt karne ke apane faisle par punarvichaar kare
 Bank sector observers also mention some other incidents in the last one year that may have gone against Shikha Sharma
 inamen exis bank samet kai nijee kshetra ke bainkon ke adhikariyon ke mani landring main shaamil hone ke bare main cobrapost dwaara kiya gaya sting or yah aarope shaamil he ki notebandi ke elaan ke turant baad exis bank kii kuch shakhaaen apane graahakon ke liye mudra badalane main lipt thim
 Shikha Sharma took over in 2009 and her third term as head of Axis Bank is coming to an end in June
 pichley saal unhen june, 2021 tak ke liye teen saal kaa chauthaa kaarykaal dene kaa faisla kiya gaya tha
 Axis Bank's NPA has increased five times in recent years to Rs 21,280 crore by the end of March 2017

 Some reports said that RBI has withheld the bonuses of the ceos of three top private banks - HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, in view of rising npas and concerns of default in corporate governance
 khabaron ke anusaar, march, 2017 main khatm hue saal ko lekar arabiai ke ek audit main yah saamne aayaa he ki exis bank ne takreeban 5,600 karod ru
 Price's steep debts were not disclosed
 bonus bhi isi saal ke liye dey tha
 HDFC Bank had also noted a deviation, while ICICI Bank said that it did not need any disclosure
 nijee kshetra ke karjadaataaon main isiisiaai bank ke khaaton main sabase zyada enpie darj hai (sitambar, 2017 ke ant tak 44,237 karod ru

 The board's need for ICICI bank-videocon bungling has underscored the importance of corporate governance and the role of independent directors
 kya swatantra nideshak sankat main tabdeel hone se pehle is masale kii ore dhyaan khinch sakate the? bhartiya jivan beemaa nigam (elisi) isiisiaai bank main sabase bada shairdharak he (12
 3 per cent) and its chairman V
 ke
 Sharma is on the bank's board
 bank ke baaki gaiyr-kaaryakari nideshak tushaar shah, dilip chokasee, amit agarwal, udai chitale (swatantra nideshak) or neelam dhawan (atirikt or swatantra nideshak) hai
 Experts find it strange that no director has raised the issue of corporate governance in the bank in the last two years
 visheshgy kehete hai ki jab koi board korporate gavarnence main ho rahi chook kii taraf se ankhen moond letaa he to yah uski is maamle main mileebhagat ke baraabar he
 "the ICICI Bank board should not have been in a hurry to give a clean chit to Chanda Kochhar in the beginning," said a veteran of the industry sector who has joined several boards as an independent director, on condition of anonymity
 ab ve funs gaye hai
 He could undergo an independent investigation before giving a clean chit to Kochhar
 '' jaanch karne ke liye board kii ek kamity sthapit kii ja sakati thi or daayre main shaamil adhikariyon ko talab kiya ja saktaa tha
 Shailesh Harbhakti, managing partner and CEO of accountancy and advisory firm Haribhakti Group, says people in powerful positions should resort to their discretion more than anything else
 haribhakti kehete hai, ''adhikariyon ko aisi kisi bhi cheez ko bardaasht na karne kii samskruti viksit kerani chahie jisase beyimaani kii bu aati ho
 The shadow of any doubt should also be thoroughly investigated and it should be done with complete impartiality
 ''isiaisiaai bank ke maamle main saarvajanik padtaal or kai jaanch agenciyon kii chaanbin ke baavjood bank ke board ne abhi tak swatantra jaanch kaa aadesh nahin diya he or iske bajaay vah apane siio kaa paksh lene main jute gaya he or bank ke kaam main kisi kism ke bhai-bhatijawad ke aaropon ko nakaar rahaa he
 Global rating agency Fitch has said that the current crisis in ICICI Bank has raised many questions about corporate governance and the bank's credibility is at stake
 agency ne 10 april ko kaha, ''credit cameti main bank ke siio kii maujuudagi or swatantra jaanch kaa samarthan karne main bank kii hichak se hamaari raay main uski korporate gavarnence paddatiyon ko lekar andeh khadey ho gaye hai
 '' And this is not the first case
 saal 2009 main satyam maamle main bhi swatantra nideshkon kii bhoomika par sawaal uthe the
 In it, the promoter of the company, Ramalinga Raju, admitted to manipulating accounts to show profitability
 pichley saal company ke board or uske sansthaapakon ke bich takaraav se infosis main korporate gavarnence ko lekar gambhir masale khadey hue the
 Last year, a SEBI committee headed by Uday Kotak, chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank on Corporate Governance, recommended several major changes in the process of appointment of independent directors in listed companies
 company kanoon main kam se kam teen nideshkon kii anivaaryta ke bare main kaha gaya he jabaki nai siforeeshon main chah nideshkon kii baat kahi gai
 It was also proposed that the directors should attend at least half of the board meetings
 saath hi gaiyr-kaaryakari nideshkon kii umr seemaa 75 saal nirdhaarit karne kii baat kahi gai
 The panel also recommended that no director should be part of more than eight boards
 haribhakti kaa kahana he ki keval kuch maamalon ke aadhaar par sabhi nijee bainkon ko andeh ke nazariye se dekhnaa vaazib nahin hoga kyonki kai nijee va saarvajanik, donon tarah ke bainkon ne korporate gavarnence ke ucch maanak sthapit kiye hai
 He says, "our country has pulled itself out of the era of crony capitalism
 swatantra nideshkon ko ucchtam str kii eemaandaaree dikhaani chahie
 Expectations from him have also increased due to allegations of dishonesty
 ''hiton kaa takaravaisiisiaai bank ke sankat ke mul main bank or videokon, donon ke ek shairdharak arvind gupta kaa 2016 main pradhanmantri ko likhaa ek patr he jisamen unhone bank par is haath le or us haath de kaa kaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Gupta claimed that Deepak Kochhar took advantage of his relationship with Chanda and added Dhoot as an investor in his energy start-up Nupower Renewables
 jaanch agenciyaan ab nupower ke kai saudon kii chaanbin kar rahi hai inamen dhoot se 64 karod kaa karj, alag-alag ikaayiyon kii sthapana or videokon samooh ko isiisiaai bank se 3,250 karod ru
 The transfer of all the shares owned by Dhoot to Deepak Kochhar, six months after getting the loan of Rs
 iske alaava jaanch rajeev kochar ke vyavsaayik lenden kii bhi ho rahi he jinaki company avista adwijuri group isiisiaai bank ke graahakon ko mashvira dene kaa kaam kiya karti thi
 This is seen as a direct case of conflict of interest
 prabandhan salaahkaar or yojana ayog ke purv sadsy arun mira kaa kahana he, ''unhen sunishchit karnaa chahie tha ki rishtedaaron ke vyavsaayik hit bank ke vyavsaayik hiton se kaaphi dur rahen
 Officially, Deepak Kochhar has claimed that his wife was unaware of his professional relationship with Videocon
 vahiin rajeev kochar ke maamle main bank ne bachaav main yah kaha he ki siio ke pati kaa bhai company kanoon main 'rishtedaaron' kii tay paribhaasha ke tahat nahin aata, lihaaja bank ke liye uske vyavsaayik hiton ko jaahir karnaa jaruri nahin tha
 But is it not natural that common people, as well as investors and shareholders of this prestigious bank, all expect the highest level of honesty and transparency from its top official
 mira kehete hai, ''jab vyavsaayik masalon kii baat aati he to aap seedhi par jitna upar chadhate jate hai, aapako utani hi duuri apane nikat ke rishtedaaron se bana leni chahie
 We should implement this ourselves, not under any law
 ''bharat main royal bank of scotland kii purv siio va chairman mira sanyaal ne jaanch agenciyon kii padtaal ke nishkarshon ke saamne aane se pehle hi kisi nattejey par pahunch jane ko lekar aagaah kiya he
 "the kind of conflict of interest allegations that are being made in the ICICI Bank case are very serious," she says
 ham ummid hi kar sakate hai ki chanda ne in naaton ko pehle jaahir kar diya hoga, jo ki gavarnence maanakon ke anusaar kisi bhi siio yaa varisht prabandhak se apekshit he
 However, Dhoot categorically denies any wrongdoing in the business relationship with Deepak Kochhar
 unhone phone par baatcheet main india today se kaha, ''maine nupower main koi nivesh nahin kiya tha
 Dhoot says that when he and Kochhar decided to work together, the company was paid Rs 1 lakh
 kii puunji ke saath sthapit kiya gaya tha
 He did not have any financial transactions with the company after that
 share bazaar ko die bayaan main isiisiaai bank ne kaha he ki use chanda kochar main ''puraa bharosa he' or ''jaisaa ki vibhinn afvaahon main aarope lagaaya ja rahaa he, saudebaaji yaa bhai-bhatijawad yaa hiton ke takaraav kaa kahin koi sawaal nahin uthta he
 The next meeting of the bank's board will be held on May 7 and will consider the company's audited results for 2017-18
 niamak kii bhoomikine maamalon ne nijee bainkon main korporate gavarnence main ho rahi chook par arabiai kii bedhyani ko bhi kathghare main khadaa kar diya he
 Experts in the ICICI Bank case have questioned the rbi's silence even after the whistleblower Arvind Gupta wrote the letter two years ago
 ek visheshgy kaa kahana he ki arabiai kam se kam itnaa to kar hi saktaa tha ki vah isiisiaai bank ko in aaropon kii swatantra padtaal ke liye board kii ek cameti banane ko kahata
 RBI has broad powers to regulate private sector banks
 march main gujarat neshnal lau uniwarsity main ek lacture main arabiai ke governor urjit patel ne kaha tha, ''nijee or videshi bainkon ke sandarbh main bainkon kii sehat, unke vyavhaar or aantarik gavarnence ke bare main upyukt niyam maujuud hai, unhen (nijee bainkon ke siio ko) unke bordon dwaara nirantar aagaah karte rahaa janaa chahie or badi athwa nirantanr aniyamitataayen pai jaaen to arabiai unhen badal bhi saktaa he
 In the case of Shikha Sharma, RBI exercised this right
 iske kaaran exis bank ko unka kaarykaal kam karne par rajamand hona padaa
 Heads of private sector banks are appointed by the bank's board for three years and RBI approval is required for appointment every time
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki arabiai unhen unke kaarykaal ke bich main bhi badal saktaa he
 Although all commercial banks in India operate under rbi's Banking Regulatory Act 1949, the central bank cannot remove the directors and management of public sector banks
 sanyaal kahati hai, ''enpie sankat or bhartiya banking kshetra main farjivade se yah baat sabit ho jaati he ki bhartiya banking ke gavarnence main kahin koi gambhir khami he
 Capitalism and political interference of nexus have compromised the honesty of Indian banks and bankers
 is disha main amulchul badlaav kii jarurat he
 She says that the Reserve Bank has an important role in re-building trust in the Indian banking system
 visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki isiisiaai bank yah sabit karne ke liye kitni bhi takneekee baaten saamne rakhe ki usne koi galat kaam nahin kiya he, lekin korporate naitikta kaa takaza yahi tha ki bank zyada paardarshee najariya saamne rakhata
 Experts are asking why Chanda Kochhar should have recused himself from the Credit Committee when the issue of Videocon was being discussed
 ve board ke saamne yah baat rakh sakati thi ki unke pati ke dhoot ke saath vyavsaayik hit hai
 Was the ICICI Bank board aware of Rajiv Kochhar's business dealings? If so, why did he turn his back to her? Was he not anticipating any crisis in the future especially when 80 per cent of the loan given by the bank to Videocon (rs 2,810 crore)
 ) 2017 main enpie ghoshit ho chukaa tha?bainkon kii pramanikta ko behaal karne or logon main yah vishwaas sthapit karne ke liye ki ve puure bharose ke saath apana dhan vahaan rakh sakate hai, turant or sakht kadam uthaae jane chahie
 However, the solution of everything is not just in laws
 mira kehete hai, ''kanoon ek baat he
 Eventually, it comes down to a person's loyalty
 vah uske charitra ko pratibimbit karata he

 com / irfo9a51md shanivaar kaa din tha, jab subah uthakar 13 varshiya prabhaa rani ne roj kii tarah ghar main jhaadu lagaai, chulhaa jalaayaa or jaanwaron ko chaara daalaa
 Then both of his younger sisters, 12-year-old Savita and 11-year-old Anita, prepared a school bag and left for school
 fatehabad kii tehsil ratiyaa se takreeban 20 kilometre dur sthit ek gaanv kaa rajkeey madhyamik vidhyalay unke gaanv se chaar kimi dur he, jahaan teenon bahanen roj paidal padhgaye jaati thim
 But on that day, Prabha and her sisters did not even know that she was going to school for the last time
 savita dari hui ankhon se us din ko yaad karti he, ''headmaster'' sar ne ek din pehle bulaakar kaha ki kal papa ko lekar aana
 We are afraid that i do not know what they will say to my father
 ''prabhaa to or bhi zyada dari hui thi
 a day before, his teacher Rupinder Kaur closed the class and asked her some questions and then killed her
 vah kahati he, ''madam ne pehle mujhse sari baat poochi or phir mujhe jor se thappad maaraa
 He told everyone
 ''agle din jab unke pita 50 varshiya kripashankar skool pahunche to vahaan maujuud headmaster rajkumaar singh ne farmaan sunaaya, ''aapaki betiyaan ab is skool main nahin pard saktin
 "kripa Shankar, admitted in a government hospital in Ratia, starts crying remembering that day," the headmaster sat in the school grounds
 sarpanch (jayachand) bhi vahiin maujuud the
 They said, Prabha, what, all three of your girls can no longer read here
 unke yahaan rahane se skool kaa maahaul kharaab hoga
 "october 13 was the last day of school for the three of them
" ab skool ke daravaaje unke liye band ho chuke hai or us daravaaje ke baahar khadi ve teenon sochati hai ki aakhir in sabamein unka kasoor kya tha? kasoor yah he ki sabase badi bahan prabhaa rape victim he
 Prabha, who lives in a village 40 km from Haryana's Fatehabad district, was raped by Sohanlal, a 65-year-old man from the same village, for the past four months
 vah uske skool ke baahar falon kaa thela lagaataa tha
 Prabha was so young that she did not even know what was happening to her
 He does not have a mother and father is mostly out of work
 ghar main ek bahut buudhe dada-daadi hai
 Taking advantage of the girl being alone, Sohanlal continued to perform this illusion for four months
 maamla tab jaakar khulaa, jab use garbh thahar gaya
 She says, "there was no menstruation for two months
 pet main dard rahata tha
 When he went to the doctor, he said that there is a child in the stomach
 phir goli di baccha giraane ke liye
 "but this question stirs that for four months he kept doing all this and Prabha did not open his mouth
" kyon? aaj bhi is sawaal kaa jawaab detii prabhaa ke chehre par dar ko saaf padhaa ja saktaa he, ''vah dhamkee detaa tha ki khabardaar, jo kisi ko bataaya
 i will kill you
 main dar ke maare kuch nahin bol pai
 "but the fear behind not speaking is not just to die
" ek dar or he, jiske bare main uski choti bahan savita pehle munh kholti he, ''aadmi kuch bhi kare, naam to ladki kaa hi kharaab hota he
 The society does not look at him with good eyes
 "on the other hand, Prabha gives her cleanliness with tears in her eyes," Bolan, i am afraid that my father will not wear them
 '' prabhaa kaa yah dar bevajaah nahin tha
 Actually this is what happened
 vah kahati he, ''pehle to papa ne pyaar se poocha
 Then when i told them the whole thing, they slapped me
 ''prabhaa apni bahanon, pita, dada-daadi, gaanvvaalon or yahaan tak ki apni najaron main bhi khud ko hi gunahagaar samajhati he
 "everyone came to know in school," she says
 ladkiyaan mujhe kharaab najar se dekhati thim
 She used to joke that it would ruin her sisters too
 '' lekin use dukh is baat kaa he ki meri donon bahanon ko skool se kyon nikaal diya gaya?mahaj 13 saal kii ek garib, kamjor kishori yadi khud ko padhai ke haq se vanchit kiye jane ke liye skool ko kasuurvaar nahin maanati to yah sunakar sadma nahin lagata
 The shock comes when the headmaster of the school and also the sarpanch of the village do not consider themselves infatuated
 40 varshiya headmaster rajkumaar singh kehete hai, ''hamane un teenon bahanon ko skool se nahin nikaala
 Kripa Shankar himself wrote that i want to get the girls' name cut
 '' jabaki hakeekat yah he ki anpadh kripashankar hastakshar karnaa bhi nahin jaanate
 He says, "the headmaster forced me to thumb over the paper
 '' pita or beti ke mutabik sarpanch jayachand is nirnay main saajhedaar the, lekin unase is babat sawaal karne par ve lagbhag gidgidaate hue kehete hai, ''meri apni teen betiyaan hai
 Why would i do this? Rajeev Ratan, additional deputy commissioner of Fatehabad, who investigated the case, says, "when we investigated the case, it was found that the girl's father himself gave it to the school in writing that i do not want to teach my daughters
" ''rashtriya maanavadhikaar ayog ne is sambandh main haryana sarkaar ko notice jari kiya he or puri ghatana kii jaanch kii maang kii he
 Haryana's Health, Education and Social Welfare Minister Geeta Bhukkal says, "we are conducting an investigation
 ladkiyaan phir se skool jaaengi or doshiyon ko sajaa jarur milegi
 "from human rights commission to state government is engaged in investigation
 mantri-adhikari bayanon main magn hai
 But a similar question floats in the eyes of Prabha and her sisters passing in front of the school, "why did the school door close for us?" "village, victim girl and family members name changed dilli sarkaar main ek aisa maamla saamne aayaa he, jiske bare main sunakar aap chaunk jaaenge yaa muskuraane lagenge
 The Delhi government had decided to form a special investigation team to investigate the 1984 anti-sikh riots, but now the file of its formation has been lost
 dilli sarkaar ke grih vibhaag ne is bare main ek circular bhi jari kiya he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki '1984 ke dangon ko lekar SIT gathan vaali file 16 march, 2015 ko tatkaaleen grih mantri (jitendra tomars) ko bheji gai thi, uske baad se nahin mil rahi, isliye sabhi vibhaagon se nivedan he ki agar aapke yahaan mili, to grih vibhaag ko bhejein
 Comments is bare main jab dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya se poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki 'iske bare main abhi jaankaree nahin he
 i will tell you later'
 lekin sarkaar ke sutara bataa rahe hai ki file gumne se cese par koi fark nahin padataa, kyonki kejariwal sarkaar ne apni pichhali sarkaar main jo SIT banaai thi, wo kaam shuru hi nahin kar pai or is bich centre ne SIT bana di, jo 84 ke sikh virdohi dangon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Therefore, missing the SIT related files of this government will not affect the case
 lekin sawaal ye he ki sarkaar ek puraa system he or system main file kho janaa or wo bhi itane samvedansheel maamle se judi? yah koi choti yaa ai gai baat to nahin ho sakati
 The Home Department of the Delhi Government has also issued a circular in this regard, stating that 'the file containing the SIT regarding the 1984 riots was sent to the then Home Minister (jitendra Tomar) on 16 March 2015, thereafter
 Can't get it from everyone, that's why all departments are requested to send it to the Home Department if you meet here
 'tippaniyan When asked about Delhi's Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, he said that 'it is not known yet
 baad main bataaungaa'
 But the government sources are saying that the missing file does not matter on the case, because the SIT that the Kejriwal government had created in its previous government could not start the work and meanwhile the Center made SIT, which was 84 Investigating anti-sikh riots
 isliye is sarkaar kii SIT sambandhit file gum hone se cese par fark nahin padegaa
 But the question is that the government is a complete system and the file is lost in the system and that too related to such a sensitive matter? It cannot be a small or a matter of fact
 is bare main jab dilli ke dipti siem manish sisodiya se poocha gaya, to unhone kaha ki 'iske bare main abhi jaankaree nahin he
 i will tell you later'
 lekin sarkaar ke sutara bataa rahe hai ki file gumne se cese par koi fark nahin padataa, kyonki kejariwal sarkaar ne apni pichhali sarkaar main jo SIT banaai thi, wo kaam shuru hi nahin kar pai or is bich centre ne SIT bana di, jo 84 ke sikh virdohi dangon kii jaanch kar rahi he

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bijepi ke saath bhavishya main unki party jediu ke kisi prakaar ke gathbandhan se inkaar karte hue kaha ki chaahe jo bhi parinaam ho yah adhyay hameshaa ke liye band ho gaya he
 In order to answer on behalf of the government after discussing Governor DY Patil's address during the joint session of the Bihar Legislature last January 14, Nitish said that under no circumstances does the question of any future alliance with BJP arise
 Whatever its consequences
 nitish ne kaha ki chaahe unki sarkaar rahe yaa jaae kisi bhi paristhiti main bijepi ke saath bhavishya main koi gathbandhan kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 Whatever its consequences
 unhone jediu or bijepi ke bich bhavishya main gathbandhan ko asambhav bataate hue kaha ki ukt adhyay kaa ant ho chukaa he
 Taking a question mark over the secular image of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Nitish retaliated on bjp's allegation of betrayal of public opinion on the bjp's demise after JDU severed ties with the BJP after making him the head of the Election Campaign Committee
 Stating that he did not break the trust but the BJP betrayed him by forgetting the promise made about the alliance
 
 nitish ne daawa kiya ki rajg shasankaal main upmukhyamantri rahe susheel kumaar modi ne bijepi ke tatkaaleen rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke saath bijepi ke ek anya varisht netaa ke dilli main sthit awaas par pichley varsh unki mulaakaat karwaai thi or gadakari ji ne aashwast kiya tha
 He even said that senior BJP leader LK Advani had also assured him that the party president's promise regarding Modi would be upheld but it did not force him to break away from the NDA
 mukhyamantri ke is khulaase ke baad pratipaksh ke netaa nandakishor yadav ne apane seat se khadey hokar iskaa kade shabdon main virodh karte hue kaha ki ve unke in netaaon kaa naam le rahe hai jabaki ve apana paksh rakhane ke liye sadan main maujuud nahin hai
 Overriding Nandkishore's objection, Nitish said that a year and a half ago, he should have expressed his views in an interview in an English national daily newspaper about what the Prime Minister of the country should be like and after ten months read the text written in the wall in BJP
 Hui decides to break up with him because of his theory
 unhone bijepi ke rashtriya or pradesh ikai ke netaaon ke jediu ke naata tod liye jane par hangaamaa kiye jane ke bare main kaha ki gathbandhan todane kaa nirnay unhone bijepi main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke yug ke ant hone tathaa ek naye yug kii shuruyaat hone ko mahasoos karte hue liya
 Nitish told Nandkishore that he would not care if he dropped his government by bringing a no-confidence motion during this session of the House or any other day for which he would request a special session by requesting the Speaker of the House
 pratipaksh ke netaa nandakishor yadav ke mukhyamantri par sarkaar bachaane ke liye ‘jugad technalaji’ main maahir hone kaa aarope lagaae jane par nitish ne unase kaha ki agar ve isamen maahir hote to varsh 2000 main unki sarkaar rah jaati
 On Nitish's challenge to the BJP to bring down the government, Sadanand Singh of the Congress said, why not accepting this challenge, Nandkishors bring down the government by bringing a no-confidence motion
 sadanand ne daawa kiya ki bijepi ko yah dar he ki aisa karne par uske chaar-paanch vidhayak apni party se naata todakar jediu kheme main aa jaaenge
 On this comment of Sadanand, Nandkishore said that it shows the love within JDU and Congress
 unhone mukhyamantri se kaha ki nitish ne congress kaa virodh karte hue raajnneeti kii he or uske saath santhganth karke siddhant kii baat kar rahe hai
 The Chief Minister, while staying together, denied Nandkishore's contribution in running the government in Bihar and asked Nandkishore to speak the name of Lord Ram every day, to tell the truth that he had a role in it

 ucchtam nyaayalay ne varsh 1992 ke hatya ke ek maamle main rajasthan ke ajmer jail main aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa kaat rahe 80 varshiya biimaar pakistani sookshmjeev vigyaani mohammad khalil chishti ko aaj maanviya aadhaar par jamaanat de di
 a bench of Justice p Sadasivam and Justice j Chelameswar granted Chisti this relief keeping in mind his age and the fact that he has been in jail for the last 20 years after a murder case was registered against him
 hatya kaa maamla tab kaa he jab vah apni maa ko dekhne ajmer kii yatra par aaye the
 Then they got into a dispute and a neighbor was killed in a quarrel and his nephew was injured
 chishti kaa janm ajmer main khwaja moinuddin chishti ke dargah kii dekharekh karne vaale ek samrudh parivaar main hua tha
 Chishti was studying in Pakistan at the time of Partition and decided to become a citizen of the same country
 peeth ne sharton or ajmer kii fast trek adaalat kii santushti ke aadhaar par chishti ko jail se reeha karne kaa nirdesh dete hue kaha ki ham is baat se santusht hai ki jamaanat par reeha kiye jane kaa maamla banataa he
 The court also agreed to hear Chishti's request to let him go back to Karachi and asked him to file a separate petition for it
 chishti kii ore se varisht adhivaktaa ne jab kaha ki unhen kam se kam dilli main rahane kii anumati di jaae to peeth ne kaha ki aap ek anya aavedan daakhil karen or in baton kaa ullekh karen ki aap apane mulk janaa chaahate hai
 We will consider that
 rashtriya rajdhani jane kii anumati dene sambandhi chishti kii yachika kaa rajasthan sarkaar ne virodh kiya
 He said that in the visa issued to Chishti, he has been allowed to stay only in Ajmer and nearby areas
 nyaayalay ne iske baad chishti ko agle aadesh tak ajmer chhodkar nahin jane ko kaha
 Chishti was granted bail a day after Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari's visit to India was discussed between officials of the two countries
 sunwaayee ke dauraan peeth ne jaradaari kii yatra kaa bhi ullekh kiya
 The bench said that it hoped that what happened yesterday would continue
 aaj kii sunwaayee ke dauraan peeth ne kaha ki agar chishti ne apana passport jamaa nahin kiya he to unhen aisa karnaa he
 Chishti's family expressed happiness over the apex court's order to release him on bail
 chishti kii putree soha ne islamabad main media se kaha ki jamaanat ‘allaah’ or asankhya pakistaniyon or bharatiyon ke prayaas ke kaaran mili he
 After an 18-year trial in the murder case, the sessions court of Ajmer finally convicted Chishti and sentenced him to life imprisonment
 satr adaalat ne sunwaayi ke dauraan chishti ko jamaanat de di thi lekin unhen ajmer nahin chhodane kaa aadesh diya gaya tha
 He was re-arrested to serve the sentence on his conviction
 ajmer main varsh 1992 ke hatya maamle main kathith bhoomika ke liye giraftaar hone ke baad satr adaalat ne unhen kuch din baad hi jamaanat de di thi lekin usne unhen ajmer chhodkar nahin jane kaa aadesh diya tha
 Chishti, who suffers from various other ailments including heart and deafness, lived in his brother's poultry farm until proven guilty
 chishti kaa maamla us samay prakaash main aayaa tha, jab ucchtam nyaayalay ke tatkaaleen nyaayadhish nyaayamurti markendeya katju ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko patr likhakar anurodh kiya tha ki pakistani naagarik ko maanviya aadhaar par maaf kar diya jaae

 "it is the job of every player to focus on his career and his good times," Waugh said
 use yah samajhnaa chahie ki vah is str par safal hone main sakasham he
 After this, he should focus on correcting small mistakes in his technique
 unhone kaha, team main shaamil ballebaaj amuman ek-duusare kii madad bhi karte hai
 If there is a problem with the technique, then it is better to talk to another teammate
 yah koi jaaduugari nahin he, keval apni kshamta par thodaa vishwaas or kuch kadi mehnat kerani padati he
 The escalation between North Korea and the US is increasing after the US attacks in Syria
 uttar korea ne america ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki america use syria samajhane kii bhul na kare
 North Korea's state media warned on Tuesday that their country could launch a nuclear attack if provoked by the US
 uttar korea ke sarkari akhbaar rhodong sinmun ne kaha he ki desh sanyukt rajya dwaara kisi bhi aakraamakata kaa jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar he
 Our Revolutionary Army is keeping an eye on all enemy movements
 iske alaava nabhikeey nigaraanee tantra na keval dakshin korea or prashanth mahaasaagar main balki america kii mukhya bhoomi par uske sainya addon par nigaah rakhe hue he
 'apart from this, South Korea's acting President Hwang Kyo-eon has asked the army to be vigilant and increase cooperation with the American military
 unhone ashanka jataai ki uttar korea parmaanu pareekshan ke alaava koi bhi bhadakaau karrwai kar saktaa he
 China has deployed 1
5 million soldiers on the North Korea border, and China has also agreed to deal with the future situation arising from the US attack on North Korea
 china neuttar koriasima par kareeb dedh lakh sainikon ko tainaat kar diya he
 Medical and backup units of the People's Liberation Army Force have been deployed along the Yalu River on the china-north Korea border
 vahiin trump ne ek baar phir kaha he ki yadi china north korea ke newclear program ke khilaaf koi kadam nahin uthaata he tab america akele hi karrwai karne ke taiyaar he
 Trump said that if China decides to help us, it will be very good for him and if he does not do so, it will not be good for anyone
 fasebuk par loktantr ko chot pahunchane kaa aarope laga he
 The data scandal has alleged that Facebook shared personal information of about 50 million Facebook users with the help of a quiz app
 yah data cambridge analitica tak pahunchaa or usne iskaa istemaal america raashtrapati chunaav main votaron ko micro target kar prabhavit karne ke liye kiya
 When the scandal comes out, agencies, organizations and people around the world are rethinking their relationship with Facebook
 haalanki bharat main aisa kuch nahin ho rahaa he
 While on one hand, Facebook is facing allegations of damage to democracy and electoral processes, on the other hand, the Election Commission of India will work with Facebook in the Karnataka elections
 aise main sawaal uth rahe hai ki aisa kyon kiya ja rahaa he?is vivaad ke liye khud fasebuk ke siio mark jakarberg ne maafee maangi he or sabakuch thik karne kaa aashwaasan diya he
 UK mps want to interrogate Zuckerberg
 unako andeh he ki fasebuk ne unke desh main bhi chunavi prakriya prabhavit karne kii koshish kii he
 This is what America is thinking of doing and Mark Zuckerberg has also agreed
 vahiin america kii regulatting agency aftisi bhi yah jaanch kar rahaa he ki kya fasebuk ne unki gopneeyata ke samjhaute kaa ulanghan kiya he, jo usne sarkari adhikariyon ke saath hastakshar kiye the
 World-renowned browser Mozilla has also distanced itself from the Facebook ad network due to privacy concerns
 farhaan akhtar jaise kai persenalities, Tesla company jaisi kai sansthaaon ne fasebuk pej, acount dilit kar die hai
 German bank Commerzbank and audio product company Sonoz have also opted out of Facebook advertisements
 # deletefacebookhesatega bhi trend kar liya he
 In such a situation, the question arises as to why the Election Commission has agreed to work with Facebook, which has been accused of unethically and illegally influencing the voting process by sharing personal information and data of people
 fasebuk ko sab kuch acha karne ke liye jabardastee nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 However, some believe that Facebook or other social media can offer many amazing views for democracy
 chunaav ayog bhi shaayad yahi maan rahaa he
 Although Facebook itself is not sure about this
 kuch maheene khud fasebuk ne bataaya ki vah loktantr ke liye hameshaa acha nahin rah saktaa
 Facebook product manager Samidh Chakraborty wrote on the official page of the Facebook company that i wish he could guarantee that the goodness of Facebook will always outweigh the evils, but he cannot say so
 yah hota sahi kadamaamtaur par jab kabhi kisi company par aarope lagate hai to aaropon kii jaanch tak uske saath sambandh ko roak dena chahie
 Facebook may not be involved in Russia's influence of the US election or the Cambridge Analytica scandal
 haalanki jaanch puri hone tak uske saath rishton ko jaanch puri hone tak roka janaa chahie tha
 Such expectations were certainly expected from those organizations which believed in morality and accountability
 chunaav ayog koi privet sanstha yaa choti sanstha nahin he
 In India, no election is a small survey
 usase lakhon karodon logon kaa bhavishya daanv par laga hota he
 India is the largest democracy in the world
 aise main jab puraa vishwa is baat kii jaanch kar rahaa he ki fasebuk ne loktantr ko nuksaan pahunchaaya yaa nahin aise main bharat kaa chunaav ayog uske saath khadaa or kaam karata nahin dikh saktaa he
 In such a situation, the ideal situation would have been that the Election Commission would review its relationship with Facebook and examine how other institutions and people are using Facebook in the electoral process
 kya vah naitik yaa kanoonee he? cambridge enelitica ke purv karmchaaree or data li scandle ke vishalbloar crystapher vili ne kabool kiya he ki uski purv company bharat ke chunavi prakriya par kaam kar rahi thi
 This is a dangerous and serious charge
 isaki jaanch chunaav ayog ko kerani chahie thi or jaanch puri hone ke baad jab is baat kii tasalli ho jaati ki fasebuk loktantr ke liye sahi he, tabhi uske saath kaam karnaa chahie tha
 On the other hand, the Chief of the Election Commission, opiravat has described this scandal of Facebook as confusing and exaggerating
 jabaki asaliyat yah he ki fasebuk ne maafee kisi bhramit or badha chadhaakar pesh karne vaale scandle ke liye nahin maangi he

 haldighati ke yuddh main maharana pratap kii veerta or shaury ke kisse har kisi kii jubaan par he
 It is the most talked about war in medieval history, in which a huge army of Akbar led by Rana Maharana Pratap of Mewar and Mansingh faced each other
 bataa den ki yah ladaai aaj hi ke din 442 saal pehle 1576 main ladi gai thi
 Maharana Pratap is remembered for this war
 kaha jaataa he ki is yuddh main unke paas mughalon kii tulana main aadhe sipaahi the or unke paas mughalon kii tulana main aadhunik hathiyaar bhi nahin the, lekin ve date rahe or mughalon ke daant khattey kar die
 The condition of the Mughals was diluted in this war, when he got the informal brother of Maharana in the form of Shakti Singh
 shakti singh ne mughalon ke samaksh maharana kii sari sainya ranneeti or khufia raaston kaa khulaasa kar diya
 The war lasted for four hours, there has been a continuous debate on whether Akbar won or Maharana Pratap won this war? Many facts and research have also emerged regarding this issue
 kaha jaataa he ki ladaai main kuch bhi nishkarsh nahin niklaa tha
 However, let us tell you that this battle lasted for four hours on June 18, 1576
 is puure yuddh main rajputon kii sena mughalon par bees pad rahi thi or unki ranneeti safal ho rahi thi
 The Mughals had become; After the war of the Mughals, Mewar, Chittor, Gogunda, Kumbhalgarh and Udaipur were captured by the Mughals
 saare rajput raja mughalon ke adheen ho gaye or maharana ko dar-badar bhatakane ke liye chhod diya gaya
 Maharana Pratap certainly retreated in the battle of Haldighati but he did not kneel in front of the Mughals
 ve phir se apni shakti jutaney lage
 Maharana Pratap had less than one historian Badanyuni wrote that "traveled with 5,000 riders

 satr kaa sanchaalan rahul kanwal ne kiya
 Rahul first asked Kailash Vijayvargiya about the development of Madhya Pradesh
 is par vijayawargeey ne kaha ki jab main pehali baar 90 main vidhayak bana tha, to sadak ke raste indore sebhopalane par maalish karwaani padati thi
 Today i was in West Bengal, from there i have reached here easily without being tired
 yahi vikaas he
 Taking part in the debate, Randeep Singh Surjewala said that Vijayvargiya ji has got the state expelled by Modi
 bijepi aaj kii manthara ban gai he
 But now the exile of the Congress is ending
 isliye is baar diwali nayaa savera lekar aegi
 Vijayvargiya replied to this, well you said
 mujhe party ne sabase pehle aapke pradesh main bheja aapako nipataane ke liye
 There we formed a government by moving from four seats
 kisaan andolanon par kailash vijayawargeey ne kaha ki kuch andolan creat kiye jate hai
 Everyone is understanding who is agitating and who is getting it done
 is par surajevaala ne poocha ki kya mandsaur ke chah kisaan nahin maare gaye? aapaki sarkaar ne eke-47 se pradesh ke kisaanon kaa seenaa chalni kar diya
 Regarding the scam to Vyapam, Surjewala said that the day it is investigated, it will prove to be the biggest scam in the country
 vijayawargeey ne kaha ki surejwaala ji aap vakil hai
 Would you not listen to the Supreme Court and the High Court? congress ke paas na to kaarykram he, na hi sankalp or na hi vikalp
 After this, Surjewala said that the CEO of NITI Aayog said that the country lags behind because there are backward states like Madhya Pradesh
 surajevaala ne madhya pradesh main rape kii badhati ghatnaon, bacchon main kuposhan, bacchon kii mrityu dar or prati vyakti aay kii khasta haalat jaise mudde uthaae
 In response, Kailash Vijayvargiya said that you have come after a lot of study
 lekin kam adhyayan kiya he
 i have tenure figures of Arjun Singh and Digvijay Singh
 mahilaon se chhedchhad ke prakaran viraasat main mili he
 When Motilal Vora was the Chief Minister, it was ordered that the report should be written when the woman arrived
 yah parampara ab bhi jari he
 The death rate of children has come down by 50 percent
 mahilaon kii maut ke maamle bhi kam hue hai
 Vijayvargiya was then asked if an entire generation had stood up
 aaj kaa noujvaan anya rajyon ko dekhtaa he tab use dukh nahin hota hoga
 Then Kailash said that we have reduced the big stain, should it not be appreciated
 surejwaala ne shivaraj par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki shivaraj ne bijepi ke netaaon kii ek puri peedi ko khatm kar diya
 These include Kailash Vijayvargiya, Uma Bharti, Babulal Gaur
 haryana se aane vaale netaa ne apni baat rakhi ki kaha to yah jaataa he ki aisa koi sagaa nahin, jise shivaraj ne thaga nahin
 On this, Vijayvargiya said that who raised the Congress from 44 seats to 400 seats
 congress ne aapke (surejwaala ke) pita ko haryana se baahar aane nahin diya
 Surjewala said that the history of this country is awash with the sacrifice of the Congress
 aresas ke mukhyalay par pehle tirangaa nahin laharaata tha
 You will talk about nationalism
 aap aise party ke netaa hai, jiske pitru sanghathan kisi netaa ne angrejon ke khilaaf ladaai nahin ladi
 Vijayvargiya said that Congress was not a party before independence, it was a movement
 mahatma gandhi ne sahi kaha tha ki aazaadee ke baad congress ko khatm kar dena chahie
 Modi ji went to Pakistan, after that we were cheated
 uske baad desh ke itihaas main sena ne pehali baar sargical strike kii

 The people of Madhya Pradesh will raise the Congress to protect the coming generations
 madhya pradesh aaj bhrashtachar, kuposhan, mahilaon par atyaachaar main number van, kisaan kii aatmahatya main number van he
 On the question of differences in Congress, he said that there is tension in every family
 hamamen koi tanaav nahin he
 If the BJP trusts this then it will be a big mistake
 jyotiraditya sindhiya se matbhed ko lekar puche gaye sawaal par unhone kaha, mujhe koi bhukh nahin he
 i want the Congress to come forward
 vikaas kaa khaakaa khinche
 During this he gave the slogan, We had defeated the whites before, now we will beat the thieves

 ghoshnaa patr main bataaenge ki aarthik vikaas ko kaise tej karenge
 Activists have struggled for 15 years
 tikat to kisi ek ko milegaa
 The question is about the future of Madhya Pradesh
 kamalnath mukhyamantri kyon bane, kai logon ke man main yah sawaal hoga
 On this, Kamal Nath said that you do not have to be worried
 hamaara lakshya ek he
 BJP leaders are saying that Kamal Nath is managing well, but our Panna Pramukh will defeat them
 is par kamalnath ne kaha ki madhya pradesh kii janata kya murkh he ki ye log jaaenge or booth par laakar bijepi ko vot dilava denge
 On this, PM Modi will finally come and win the BJP, on which Kamal Nath said that it is easy to face, not the country
 ye log saadhe chaar saal intjaar kar rahe the
 How will the price of petrol decrease, how will the price of rupee be better, answer has to be given
 madhya pradesh kii janata bholi-bhali he, lekin bahut samajhadaar he
 Every class feels that they have been cheated
 ab to sadhu-santon ko bhi lag rahaa he ki unhen thaga gaya he
 BJP lost in UP by-election

 i have told Rahul Gandhi that i am going but will bring back the Congress
 voton ke bikharaav ko lekar puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha he ki meri sapa se bhi baat hui he
 Everyone aims to defeat the BJP
 jab janata tay kar legi ki bijepi ko bade pyaar se ravaanaa karnaa he to vah use haraa degi
 Are you benefiting from Rahul Gandhi's arrival in Madhya Pradesh? Ever since Rahul Gandhi became president, we have done better in Gujarat, Karnataka

 Now the slogan will be that daughter teach and save from BJP

 Again this type of statement only seems under pressure
 unhone mahagathbandhan ke sawaal par kaha ki modi or shah se trast log jarur saath aaenge
 In this, not only opposition parties, BJP will also have some leaders
 digvijay kii maane to loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main bijepi ko keval 31 fisad vot mila tha
 Which Modi and Shah consider a big victory
 lekin unhen pataa nahin ki 69 fisadi logon ne unhen vot nahin diya, phir aap use badi jeet kaise maan sakate hai
 Attacking Shivraj, the Congress leader said that there is a family in Budhni who does all the work
 jaith kaa ek parivaar he jo theke bhi letaa he
 Apart from this family, nobody flourished in Budhni
 jaith gaanv main 24 ghante bijli hoti he, jabaki bagal ke gaanv main bijli hi nahin aati he
 He said that BJP leaders remember Ram when elections come
 chunaav khatm hote hi ye ram ko bhul jate hai

 iviem kaa sorce code teen-chaar logon ke paas he
 Codes are entered abroad

 If i get the machine, the reverse source will know the source code
 sorce code pataa karte hi ek candidet ke vot duusare ke khate main daalaa ja saktaa he
 If 70 percent of the country's parties are saying that we do not want EVM, then it should be so
 shivaraj singh chouhan ne kya kaam kiya he
 After traveling 1800 kilometers along the banks of the Narmada, i saw three trees

 Machines are being mined on the banks of the Narmada without permission
 rafel ke mudde par digvijay ne kaha ki jab 126 vimaanon kii zarurat thi to 36 vimaan hi kyon kharide gaye
 What kind of policy is this? How many airplanes are needed to protect the country
 air force ne akalan kiya to 126 kii zarurat bataai
 The BJP reduced the number of planes to play with the security of the country
 aapane 36 vimaan hi kyon kharide? usamen bhi 60 percent hi kaam karenge
 On the question of Shivraj's return, Digvijay said that this time we have made preparations

 Yuvraj is once again seen returning to the old rhythm
 unhone 26 gend main ek chauke or do chhakkon kii madad se 34 ran kii pari khilne ke alaava ek kaich bhi lapka
 He bowled two overs, conceding 14 runs and with his strong return, warned the rivals that he was ready to blow his sleep once again

 He also hit a six off wide long on off former New Zealand captain and veteran spinner Daniel Vettori
 unhone apana doosraa chakka jacob oram par deep midwicket par maaraa
 However, he was lucky when the ball was flown in the air trying to play a pull shot on Adam Milne, but Mills and wicketkeeper mccullum, who were running from the boundary, could not catch the catch despite a lot of effort
 is dauraan mills or makkulam ke bich kaaphi tej takkar bhi hui jiske baad kuch der khel rukaa rahaa or mills ko chotil hokar baahar janaa padaa
 There were huge banners and placards in the hands of the audience, on which Yuvraj was congratulated for his return
 bhartiya team ne pehle kshetrarakshan kaa faisla kiya or jab yuvaraj ne maidan par kadam rakhaa to kartal dhwani se unka swaagat kiya gaya
 This left-handed batsman also shook hands and accepted the greetings of the audience
 bharat ne shuru main do wicket chatkaakar newjiland kii haalat khasta kar di thi
 This enthralled the spectators but the Chepak Stadium was submerged in the noise when Yuvraj got the ball for the first time
 vah midiwicket par kshetrarakshan kar rahe the or unhone pehle over main hi martin guptil ke shaat ko rokane main vahi puraani furti or chapaltaa dikhaayi
 Yuvraj, one of India's top fielders, stopped Kane Williamson's shot by diving in the third over and made it clear that he had no problem returning to the old color again
 yuvaraj ke agle over main brandan makkulam ne chakka lagaaya lekin iske baad unhone isi ballebaaj ke karaare shaat ko kaich main tabdeel karne kii puri koshish kii
 The ball went out of his hand
 yuvaraj isse chotil ho gayi or unhen maidan par upachaar lenaa padaa
 The spectators were once stunned by his injury but as soon as he came to bowl the last ball of the over, the stadium started to resonate with 'yuvi Yuvi'
 dhoni ne bhi yuvaraj ke is prayaas kii saraahna kii
 Yuvraj conceded 14 runs in his two overs
 yuvaraj ko iske baad maidan chhodana padaa jisase darshak bhi maayoos ho gayi
 Harbhajan Singh, who was his special friend and returning to the team after more than a year to field, replaced Yuvraj
 yuvaraj haalanki adhik der tak baahar nahin rahe or jald hi maidan par laut aaye
 He then took a catch and it was not easy

 The World Bank has said this in its latest report
 world bank ke tahat abhi tak bharat main 18
 2 crore people have benefited and 15% of the needy people get social security from this scheme
 world bank kii report aise vakt par ai he, jab mahatma gandhi naregaa yojana ke bhavishya ko lekar samay-samay par sawaal uthte rahe hai or is yojana kii kamazoriyon ko lekar bahes chalati rahi he
 It is important that ever since the Modi government came to power last year, various speculations were being made about the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA scheme
 mahatma gandhi naregaa yojana kaa tazaa haal jaanane jab main gajibad ke galand gaanv pahunchaa, to ek alag hi tasviir nazar ai
 The village head told that the workers often like to work in factory or private companies, because they get more money there
 isliye mahatma gandhi naregaa yojana ke tahat kaam karne vaale zyada log nahin aate hai
 When they do not find work anywhere, then they find work under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA scheme
 pradhan ke bhai anil sharma ne bataaya ki mahatma gandhi naregaa yojana ke tahat sthaayee kaam sambhav nahin hota
 He had cleaned one of the ponds in the village with the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA Scheme Fund, but a few days later the pond became dirty again as the people of the village did not stop throwing garbage in the pond
 wo kehete hai mahatma gandhi naregaa yojana kanoon main sanshodhan hona chahie, jisase mazaduron ko zyada pement mil sake or iske tahat sthaayee esets banaaya ja sake
 But the most shocking thing about the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA scheme in the village is that most of the unemployed youth here do not know anything about it
 unhone enditivi india ko bataaya ki iske bare main hamane kabhi suna tak nahin he
 In such a situation, the question arises that despite the need why information about such important scheme is not reaching the needy even after almost a decade

 According to reports, Pakistani intelligence agency ISI has helped Dawood to shift back to Karachi
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki beete kuch dinon se ISI ne daaud kopakistan or afghanistan kii simaase sate kisi ilaake main shift kar diya tha
 But the ISI has taken this step in view of Dawood's security because of the ongoing battle between Pakistan Army and tehreek-e-taliban on the border of Afghanistan
 sutron ke hawaale se ye bhi khabar aa rahi he ki bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ne kareeb hafte din pehle chota shakeel or anis ibrahim kaa phone tap kiya he jiskaa lokation karachi bataa rahaa he

 According to this defense, which Law Minister Salman Khurshid recently tried to put into practice, the government's policy has always been first-come, first-served rather than auction, to which the then Telecom Minister A
 raja ne amal kiya tha
 If there was a flaw, it was a process
 par dastavej sarkaar ke jhooth kaa pardaafash karte hai
 On November 22, 2007, the then Finance Secretary D
 subbarao ne tatkaaleen doorsanchaar sachiv di
 s
 maathur ko ek patr likhakar 2001 main nirdhaarit keemton ko chah varsh baad 2007 main istemaal karne ke doorsanchaar mantralay ke faisle par aapatti jataai or unase poocha tha ki is vittiya masale par vitt mantralay se raay kyon nahin lee gai
 Thus the Finance Ministry was arguing in favor of the auction
 23 november, 2007 ko subbarao ne doorsanchaar sachiv ko ek vistrut masauda note likhaa, jisamen unke is daawey ko chunauti di gai thi ki oonchi fees liye jane kaa nateeja upabhoktaaon ke liye oonchi daron main nikalegaa
 The Finance Ministry's argument in favor of the auction was being strengthened
 9 janvari, 2008 ko yani raja dwaara licensiyon ke naam 121 aashay patr jari kiye jane ke ek din pehle vitt mantralay ke ek varisht adhikari ne vitt mantri pi
 Assigned a position paper to Chidambaram about the auction of spectrum
 yah samooche doorsanchaar ayog kii baithak kii taiyaari ke silsile main tha, jo 9 janvari se sthagit karke 15 janvari ko kar di gai thi
 The issue of spectrum pricing continued to be discussed in the Finance Ministry on 15 January 2008, despite Chidambaram declaring it a 'closed chapter'
 vitt mantralay ke varisht naukarshahon ke bich april ke pehle saptaah main noton or gyapanon kaa aadan-pradaan iskaa saboot he
 Till then, spectrum was not allotted and licenses could be canceled
 6 july, 2008 ko subbarao ne 'spectrum masalon par' ek note main likhvaya ki mulya nirdhaaran kaa faisla pradhanmantri, vitt mantri or doorsanchaar mantri kii maujuudagi main liya gaya tha
 These documents are the Home Minister P

 As finance minister, he was empowered to quash Raja's decisions on pricing — the finance ministry's views on finance-related issues have a clear preference in all departments
 november 2007 se april 2008 tak ke patrachaar se spasht he ki chidambaram ke mantralay ke adhikari doorsanchaar vibhaag ke spectrum kii nilaamee na karne ke faisle se puri tarah asahmat the
 Chidambaram himself remained in favor of the auction from November 2007 until the January 15, 2008, retreat
 tab unhone ek note main likhaa tha ki pehle jo hua (yani raja ke die aashay patr), use 'band adhyay' mana jaae
 This document was included in presentations made to the Public Accounts Committee earlier this year
 chidambaram ne koi spashtikaran nahin diya he ki unhone apni jimmedaari chhodkar achaanak apane adhikariyon kii salaah ke vipareet raja ke faislon kaa samarthan karnaa kyon shuru kar diya
 The government's claim that Chidambaram may have been in favor of auctions at the private level, he could not reject the Cabinet's decision, is completely untrue
 2003 main liye cabinet ke ek faisle ke mutabik vitt mantralay ko spectrum ke mulya nirdhaaran main dakhal dene kaa adhikaar he
 In case of differences between the telecom and finance ministries, the matter should have been sent to the cabinet for final decision
 par yah cabinet ko kabhi bheja nahin gaya
 Instead, the decision to endorse Raja's spectrum pricing policies was taken at a July 4, 2008 meeting in which the Prime Minister, Chidambaram and Raja were present
 spectrum mulya nirdhaaran masale par chidambaram ne 15 janvari ke baad duusari baar apane adhikariyon kii salaah kii andekhi kii
 But this time the Prime Minister was also involved in it
 pradhanmantri ne sidhi bhagidaari se batch nikalne kaa prayaas kiya
 In a conversation with electronic media editors on 16 February 2011, when India Today editor-in-chief Arun Puri asked why Raja did not take his advice for the auction, why did he not take a firm decision, the Prime Minister giving himself a clean chit The entire finance and telecom ministers were blamed
 pradhanmantri ne kaha, ''kai baar kii charchaa ke baad donon mantri sahamat hue ki 2ji ke maamle main, khaskar jitna spectrum nirmit kiya gaya he or license samajhaite se sambhddha he, uske sandarbh main hamen vartmaan pranali se hi kaam chalaanaa hoga
 This is the background as to why i did not take any further action in the matter of spectrum pricing, because if both the Ministry of Finance and Telecom agree and are bound to take a decision on the issue under the 2003 Cabinet decision and try (india's) Telecom Regulatory Authority) and Telecom Commission experts - all of these are of the same view, so i felt that i was not in a position to insist on auction
 ''yadi, jaise pradhanmantri ne kaha, vitt mantri sahamat the, to chidambaram bhi raja jitne hi doshi hai
 Till now, Chidambaram has not denied the Prime Minister
 india today ke sampark karne par chidambaram ne kaha, ''main kuch nahin kahuunga
 The Prime Minister has not been completely transparent
 usee baatcheet main jab india today ne poocha ki 2008 main 2ji niti par vyapak virodh ke baavjood aapane 2009 main raja ko apni cabinet main phir doorsanchaar mantri kyon banaaya to unhone kaha, ''tab tak, sach kahuun to, mere paas yah sochane kaa koi kaaran nahin tha ki gambhir rup se koi galat baat ho gai he
 So i did not feel that i had any right to object to Raja's joining the cabinet, because in May 2009, though complaints were coming from all sides, some from companies that had not benefited, some from his Those who benefited, but did not get enough, and so i was not in a position to think that there was anything seriously wrong with the king's actions by that time
 ''yah kahkar ki shikaayatein sirf prabhavit companiyon se aa rahi thim, manmohan singh apni hi sarkaar ke bheetar se, subbarao or atirikt sachiv sindhushri khullar sareekhe varisht adhikariyon se aa rahi shikayaton kii ore se ankhen moond rahe the
 It seems incredible that the Prime Minister was unaware of the views of his very senior officials

 ''november 2007 main chidambaram ke sabase varisht vittiya naukarshah is jimmedaari se waakif the
 How Subbarao forgot this responsibility for the sake of his political masters is an intimate aspect of the 2G story
 29 november, 2007 ko tatkaaleen doorsanchaar sachiv maathur ne subbarao ko javaabi patr main crossover licenson ke mulya nirdhaaran par apane mantralay ke faisle kaa bachaav kiya
 He wrote, "the entry fee was fixed in 2003 based on the cabinet decision for the UAS (unified Access Service) system
 faisla kiya gaya ki yueyes license ke liye pravesh shulk chauthe cellular oparator jitna rakhaa jaae, jo 2011 kii nilaamee prakriya par aadhaarit tha
 He did not say why the finance ministry was not consulted on the issue with such severe financial consequences
 vitt mantralay unke jawaab se santusht nahin tha
 On November 30, 2007, Subbarao wrote in a note on a file, "there was no response as to why the financial result was not referred to the Finance Ministry
" ''yahi do patr is baat ke saboot nahin hai ki 2007 main vitt mantralay dohare prayog vaali takanic ke licenson kii raja kii nirdhaarit keemton se naakhush tha
 a draft memorandum written to Subbarao's Mathur on 23 November 2007 detailed the position of the Finance Ministry
 ajeeb baat he ki yah masauda doorsanchaar sachiv ko kabhi nahin bheja gaya
 In this document, Subbarao challenged the claim of the Department of Telecommunications, which Khurshid now supports, that charging higher entry fees would result in higher rates for consumers
 subbarao ne likhaa, ''yah kahana sahi nahin hoga ki pravesh shulk main badhotaree se, jo philhal 2001 main kii gai nilaamee par aadhaarit he, seva kii laagat badhegi
 If the operator is able to use the spectrum more efficiently, then there will be no additional cost, which will be incurred on the consumer
 ''vitt sachiv ne spasht tark diya ki sarkaar ko dey pravesh shulk main badhotaree jarur kii jaae, bhale hi 2ji spectrum aavanton ke liye koi nilaamee na hui ho
 Subbarao wrote, "the calculation of entry fee is based on the 2001 auction prices as the basis and then the improvement in technology as the transport capacity of the spectrum and the increase in the demand as the number of consumers as well as per consumer Can be matched by increasing the communication
 ''jaahir he ki vitt mantralay ke paas licenson ke daam badhaane ke liye nilaamee kaa vikalp man main tha, par usne ise doorsanchaar vibhaag ko na bhejne kaa faisla kiya
 Why? In early January 2008, Chidambaram insisted on a meeting of the entire telecom commission to not allow Raja's efforts to be overturned, which includes officials from the ministries of finance, telecommunications, information technology and industry, as well as the Planning Commission
 purna ayog ke paas tri ko kaatane kaa adhikaar he, jisane 2ji licenson ke liye pehle aao, pehle paao vidhi kii sifarish kii thi
 Raja first agreed to the Telecom Commission meeting on 9 January
 3 janvari ko chidambaram ko bataaya gaya ki yah baithak sthagit kar 15 janvari ko rakhi gai he
 Unaware of Raja's plan to issue letters of intent to 121 licensees on January 10, Khullar wrote in a note on January 9, "the Finance Minister has directed that meaningful press reports of the last two months on spectrum prices and telecom conflicts To be noticed maujuuda or nae praveshkartaaon ko 2ji spectrum or atirikt licenson kaa aavanton is samay janata kaa dhyaan khinchne vaala sabase vivaadaaspad vishay he or is par ek sthiti patr taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Its draft was discussed with the Finance Secretary and the final draft is attached
 samooche doorsanchaar ayog kii baithak aaj honi thi, par ab yah baithak 15 janvari, 2008 tak ke liye sthagit kar di gai he
 The Finance Secretary has expressed his desire that i represent him in this meeting
 ''baad main yuva maamle evam khel mantralay main bhej di gayi khullar isi sthiti patr main likhti hai, ''spectrum aavanton kaa sabase paardarshee tarika nilaamee kaa hoga
 "on January 10, Raja went straight ahead in issuing 121 letters of intent to licensees without waiting for the entire Telecom Commission meeting
" chidambaram ko is par aapatti kerani chahie thi, par unhone nahin kii
 He made this position paper the basis of his confidential note sent to the Prime Minister on 15 January 2008, in which he argued in favor of an auction based system for allocation of spectrum in future
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki ateet main kiye spectrum aavantnon ko 'band adhyay' mana jaae
 Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal in a recent interview tried to clarify, "this is a view
 15 janvari ghatana ghatane ke baad kii taarikh he
 Till then letters of intent had been issued
 vitt mantri ne ise iske baad mana
 Earlier, he did not get the idea from the Department of Telecommunications, but did with the Department of Telecommunications
 ''sibbal ke spashtikaran se puri tarah kaayal nahin hua ja saktaa
 Letters of intent were issued on January 10, but the license agreements were signed between February 27 and March 7
 spectrum kaa vaastavik aavanton april tak nahin hua tha
 Chidambaram and Subbarao had plenty of time to insist on the auction
 lekin unhone apane daayitv chhod die
 The minutes of the Chidambaram and Raja meeting on January 30, 2008, which also included Subbarao, reveal four things: what needs to be done next should be on a legally sound basis
 ateet yani 10 janvari, 2008 main jane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 It is best to auction spectrum to raise resources
 10 janvari kii ghatnaayen 'atakalon par aadhaarit prayaas' thim
 According to a former finance ministry official, government meetings between Chidambaram and Raja, many of which did not record proceedings contrary to government regulations, were held in Tamil with considerable courtesy
 yuva raja varisht chidambaram ke prati puraa sammaan darshaate
 The finance minister knew how to deal with the DMK minister, whose party was important for his own chances of winning the next election
 3 april or 7 april 2008 ke bich spectrum ke mulya nirdhaaran kaa mudda khullar or subbarao ke bich aadan-pradaan ke dauraan phir aayaa
 Khullar added an important point in the case
 unhone likhaa, ''is charan main spectrum ke mulya nirdhaaran se sambandhit buniyadi mudde uthaae ja sakate hai
 "in response, Subbarao said," The Finance Minister agreed that the use of spectrum should be increased
 ''subbarao ne nirdesh diya ki vitt mantri ke vichaaron ko pratibimbit karte hue ek karyaalay gyaapan jari kiya jaae
 This work was assigned to 1989 batch IAS officer and Director of Infrastructure in the Ministry of Finance, Govind Mohan
 9 april, 2008 ko dilli airport par landan kii udaan kaa intjaar karte hue chidambaram ne ek bijness dainik kii report dekhi, jisamen mohan ke karyaalay gyaapan ko vistaar se diya gaya tha
 In it, the Finance Ministry's opinion was given in favor of bidding
 bataate hai, chidambaram is par bahut khafa hue
 Worse, Mohan wrote the note on the letterhead of the Department of Expenditure instead of the wrong letterhead — the Department of Economic Affairs
 chidambaram ne airport se hi phone par mohan ko fatkaar lagaai
 India Today has a letter of apology written by Mohan on 10 April 2008, three days after Subbarao's instructions
 isamen unhone galat letterhed par galat karyaalay gyaapan jari karne kii puri jimmedaari sweekaar kii he
 There is no mention of it being leaked
 mohan ne likhaa, ''galati, asaavadhaaneevash hi sahi, puri tarah adhohastakshari kii he
 Mohan's apology was immediately sent to Chidambaram in London through an Indian High Commission official
 11 farvari, 2008 ke vitt mantralay ke note main, jiskaa hawala subbarao ne diya he, zyada aay ke liye nilaamee kaa ek vikalp diya gaya he
 It suggested that the government pay Rs 1,651 crore
 kii jagah harek akhil bhartiya license par 5,772 karod ru
 Could earn vitt mantri ne yah suzav bhi radd kar diya tha
 In another unusual correspondence on 17 April 2008, the Finance Ministry sent a letter (non-paper) to the Department of Telecommunications on the spectrum issue
 tab vitt mantralay main rahe ek varisht adhikari ke mutabik, chidambaram ne hi non paper bhejne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Yashwant Sinha says, "it is strange that a government department should communicate with other government departments through non-paper
" amuman kootnithik patrachaar main iskaa istemaal hota he
 In this, the Finance Ministry agreed in principle with the Department of Telecommunications not to auction the spectrum initially
 yahi nahin, usne do sharton ke saath 3ji spectrum ke liye antarrashtriya pratispardhaatmak boli lagane kii prakriya kaa majbootee se samarthan kiya tha
 The first condition was to launch it essentially in the market
 saal bhar main use shuru nahin kiya gaya to spectrum waapas le liya jayega or boli kaa bhugtan jabt kar liya jayega
 There were special conditions for the second qualification, so that only serious contestants came on the field
 raja ne jo janvari main kiya tha, yah uske ain ulat tha
 But Chidambaram did not insist on the auction in the July 4, 2008 meeting with the Prime Minister and the King
 vitt mantralay ke ek purv adhikari ke mutabik, ''jab subbarao baithak se laute to unhone hamen bataaya ki unhone (chidambaram or khud unhone) haar maan lee thi
 Subbarao was made the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India two months later

 Anna DMK chief Jayalalithaa has demanded his resignation along with BJP
 par kya chidambaram sirf bali kaa bakra hai? kya maamla or upar kaa he
 On October 10, the Supreme Court will consider the plea of janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy to investigate the role of Chidambaram in the 2G spectrum case from the CBI
 adaalat yah aadesh detii he to grih mantri ko istipha dena padegaa
 Given the seriousness of the situation, Chidambaram's silence on the allegations against him is shocking
 unke khilaaf ye aarope swami se shuru hokar vitt mantralay kii ore se 25 march, 2011 ko piemo ko bheje gaye note par khatm hote hai
 Is Chidambaram's silence to prevent the prime minister's potential role from being exposed
 bakaul ek cabinet mantri, ''ajeeb baat he
 The reason why Chidambaram did not pressurize Raja's order for the auction process, is because the Prime Minister's consent was in Raja's decision
 ''sinha kehete hai, ''pradhanmantri chook karne ke doshi hai, kyonki unhone tab kadam nahin uthaaya jab ve spectrum ke aavanton ko roak sakate the
 The then Finance Minister is guilty of abandoning the original judgment, which called for auctioning of spectrum due to scarceness
 ''congress ke saansad is puure prakaran se duuri banaae rakhane or sari jimmedaari chidambaram ke kandhe par chhod dene ke pradhanmantri kii koshish se naakhush hai
 The party stands behind the Home Minister
 yahaan tak ki digvijay singh sareekhe chidambaram ke virdohi ne media main yah kehete hue unka bachaav kiya ki ''ve eemaandaar or kaabil vyakti hai
 There is no question of any charge against him
 ''chidambaram kaa bachaav karne kaa aadesh sonia gandhi ne diya he
 The Congress leadership knows that any finance minister at that time would have done what Chidambaram did
 gathbandhan ke dabaav ke kaaran congress zyada kuch nahin kar sakati thi, kyonki dramuk ke saansadon ke samarthan ke bina sarkaar gir jaati
 The Supreme Court may leave the decision of the CBI to investigate Chidambaram's role on the trial court in the 2G scam
 supreme court main 2ji maamle main centre sarkaar ke vakil pi
 P
 raav ne tark diya ki chidambaram kii bhoomika kii jaanch sibiai se karaae jane kii maang ko nichali adaalat kii jaanch ke saath jod diya jaae
 This will give Chidambaram and the Congress some time
 isse deree ho sakati he, par virodhabhas khatm nahin honge
 10 Chidambaram, known for his closeness with Janpath, is so important to the party that he cannot be sacrificed
 aisa hua to sara dhyaan pradhanmantri kii bhoomika kii ore gum jayega
 Manmohan knows that his argument of coalition pressure will not work in court
 janata kii adaalat main yah pehle hi khaarij ho chukaa he
 If Chidambaram had to resign in the 2G spectrum case, the upa's stability could be in danger
 or phir agle saal paanch rajyon main chunaav hone hai
 Out of these, the results of four including Uttar Pradesh will be important for the next presidential election of the country
 upie kabhi raashtrapati chunaav haarane kaa jokhim nahin lenaa chahega
 For this, he has to secure his electoral base at the state level
 is bich, grih mantralay main sab kuch pehle jaisaa dikh rahaa he
 a Home Ministry official said, "chidambaram is holding meetings as before
" ve ab bhi akkhad hai
 "no one knows what they are thinking
" haalanki bete karti ke twit se unke mizaaj kaa kuch pataa jarur chalata he
 He wrote, "the good thing in a crisis born of propaganda is that true friends are identified in it
" '' chidambaram apni pasandida yojana, neshnal counter-terrerism centre ko teji se aage badhaane main vyast hai
 "it would be difficult to find his option in the Home Ministry," said a cabinet colleague
 naksalwadiyon ke khilaaf kharaab record ke baavjood kam log hai, jo is mantralay ko itani kushalta se sambhaal sakate hai
 Chidambaram has many concerns
 ek tamilnadu kii ek adaalat main unke chunaav ko di gai chunauti he
 The court is hearing the petition of a leader of the Anna DMK, challenging his election to the Lok Sabha in 2009

 Recently, when he called a meeting of the Vigilance and Monitoring Committee in his constituency Sivaganga, two out of seven collectors left saying that they had to go to Chennai to attend a meeting with the Chief Minister

 chidambaram ne kaha, ''baithak colectoron se baatcheet karke rakhi gai thi
 Chidambaram started dreaming of replacing Manmohan Singh in 2011
 par sitambar main ek jila colector ne unhen jhatka de diya
 Apparently, p
 chidambaram ke liye yah sahi vakt nahin he
 In a conversation with TV editors on 16 February 2011, the Prime Minister said in response to an India Today question that Chidambaram and Raja were 'agreed' on the issue of spectrum pricing
 agar chidambaram sahamat the, to phir ve apane cabinet sahyogi e
 Why is Raja not guilty as much? The Prime Minister said that he did not interfere in the pricing policy because it was based on a cabinet decision in 2003
 upie ke pradhanmantri ko rajg sarkaar ke paanch varsh puraane cabinet faisle kaa paalan karne kii jarurat kyon mahasoos hui ?farvari 2011 ko sampadakon ke ek samooh ke saath baatcheet main, pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki farvari 2009 main unke paas yah maanane kii koi vajah nahin thi ki kuch gambhir taur par galat ho chukaa he
 this is not right
 media ek varsh se zyada samay se aisi khabaron se ata padaa tha or vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon ne baar baar vitt mantri ko sari jaankaree di thi
 CBI was already working in this case and four months later, in October 2009, it had registered an FIR in the 2G scam
 or phir, agar kuch galat nahin tha, to ve raja ko vahi mantralay dene main kyon hichaakicha rahe the?aashay patr janvari 2008 main jari kiye gaye the or spectrum april, 2008 main aavantit kiya gaya tha
 So when the finance ministry officials had said that the government could raise more revenue than this, then why was the allocation not canceled? When Raja informed the Prime Minister on November 2, 2007, that they would get the cut-off date 1 On October 25, 2007, he is going to shuffle on October 2007, so why did the Prime Minister not object? On March 12, 2010, the Supreme Court held that Raja's move was unlawful

 In its charge sheet filed on 2 April 2011, CBI accepted this procedure as the best
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki tatkaaleen vitt mantri chidambaram ne aarthik maamalon ke vibhaag main atirikt sachiv khullar kii baat ko khaarij kyon kar diya?chidambaram ne aashay patr jari hone ke paanch din baad dinaank 15 janvari, 2008 ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke naam patr likhakar kaha ki raja kii ore se aavantit spectrum ko ''band adhyay maan liya'' janaa chahie
 He said despite admitting that "spectrum is a scarce resource and its value should be determined only in view of its rarity and use
" ''tatkaaleen vitt mantri ne iske saath hi yah bhi kaha ki ''spectrum aavanton kaa sabase zyada paardarshee tarika uski nilaamee karnaa hoga
 Chidambaram and the then Telecom Minister A
K
 raja ke bich 30 janvari, 2008 ko ek baithak hui
 The main issues of the meeting were: the rarity of spectrum and the price of spectrum in view of it
 tab tak license jari nahin kiye gaye the, lihaaja puri prakriya roki ja sakati thi
 Despite this, why was the allocation of spectrum not stopped? Why did the then Finance Minister send a non-paper, semi-official dialogue to the then Telecom Minister on 17 April 2008, in which he suggested that 3G spectrum should be auctioned 
 usee main unhone yah bhi sweekaar kar liya ki 2ji ke liye nilaamee prakriya kii jarurat nahin he
 Officials of the Finance Ministry repeatedly wrote to the Telecom Minister and also pointed out to the Finance Minister that the price of spectrum should be fixed keeping in view the new market realities
 use 2001 kii keemton par nahin aavantit kiya janaa chahie
 If the finance minister and the telecom minister had accepted the suggestion of the officials, the government would have earned a lot of revenue
 khaskar aise samay main jab doorsanchaar sarkaar ke vaarshik gaiyr-kar rajasav kaa iklauta sabase bada strot tha
 The suggestion of the officials was clearly ignored

 bihar main bahubali kii jail kii rihaai ko lekar mahagathbandhan ke bheetar raar chhidi hui he, to uttar pradesh main sattarudh party ke mukhiya ke parivaar main ghamaasan machaa hua he
 On the other hand, the rhetoric and infighting of the BJP leaders who have been ruling in Madhya Pradesh for 13 years is causing trouble for the party
 bihar main bahubali par siyasathaal main jail se reeha hue gangster aurargedy netaa shahabuddinke masale par mahagathbandhan main sarkaar banane ke 10 maheene baad pehali baar badi daraar najar aa rahi he
 After coming out of jail, Shahabuddin said that his leader is Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar is the 'leader of circumstances'
 shahabuddin ke is bayaan ke baad hi soobe kii siyasat garmane lagi
 Nitish Kumar did not give much comment to this comment and said that everyone knows who got the mandate
 shahabuddin or nitish ke bayanon parargedy netaa or purv kendriya mantri raghuvansh prasad sinhane shahabuddin ke bayaan ko jaij tehraate hue kaha, 'gathbandhan main bahut sari partiyaan hai or lalu hamaare netaa hai
 The alliance partners decided to make Nitish Kumar the CM
 maine iskaa samarthan nahin kiya, lekin wo faisla le chuke the
 'the problems of such a grand alliance increased JDU on this statement of Raghuvansh
 party netaaon nelalu prasadse apil kii ki wo raghuvansh jaise netaaon par lagaam lagaaein or apana gathbandhan dharm nibhaaen
 The Mahagathbandhan Congress also warned RJD leaders that opposition to CM Nitish Kumar while in government cannot be tolerated
 agar argedy ko nitish kumaar se shikaayat he to vah gathbandhan se baahar ho jaae
 Apart from all these, the opposition BJP is attacking the state government for the release of Shahabuddin under Nitish Kumar's rule, known as Good Governance Babu
 aisi bhi atakalein hai ki siem kii chhavi ko dekhte hue rajya sarkaar shahabuddin ko krime control act ke tahat phir se jail main daal sakati he
 It will be interesting to see what turn the political arrogance takes regarding the release of Shahabuddin
 kya shahabuddin ko jail hogi yaa mahagathbandhan tut jayega?upi main sapa kunbe main ghamasanuttar pradesh main sattarudh siyaasi parivaar main chhidi power politics ab sataha par aa gai he
 On Monday, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadavane also discharged Chief Secretary Deepak Singhal on Tuesday after Mulayam Singh and Shivpal's two ministers close to Gayatri Prajapati and Raj Kishore Singh were dropped from the cabinet
 is uthapatak main shaam dhalate-dhalate akhilesh yadav ko upi pradesh adhyaksh ke pad se hataa diya gaya
 Mulayam handed over the responsibility of UP president to Shivpal Yadav in his place
 vahiin, palatwaar karte hue siem ne mangalvaar der shaam shivpal ko teen mantralayon se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 The matter of estrangement between Akhilesh and Shivpal has now reached the court of Netaji i
e
 Mulayam Singh Yadav
 netaji ne akhilesh or shivpal ko dilli talab kiya to shivpal unase milane dilli pahunch gaye lekin akhilesh ne aisa nahin kiya
 He said on Wednesday that this fight is not in the family but in the government
 akhilesh ne yah bhi kaha ki kuch faisle netaji ke kehane par liye gaye hai, kuch unhone (siem ne) khud liye hai
 Recently, there was a rift between Shivpal and Akhilesh about the merger of Mukhtar Ansari's Partikoumi Ekta Dal's SP
 shivpal singh kii pahal par kaumi ekta dal kaa sapa main vilay karaayaa gaya tha, lekin apni image ko lekar chintit siem akhilesh ne iskaa virodh kiya or mulaayam singh yadav ko khud elaan karnaa padaa ki mukhtaar ansaari kii party kaa sapa main vilay nahin hoga
 There are only six months left for the assembly elections in UP
 aise main siyaasi kunbe main ghamaasan akhilesh sarkaar ke liye nuksaandaayak hogi yaa phir siyaasi ranneeti ke tahat yadav parivaar agle chunaav ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar rahaa he
 Experts believe that separating Shivpal from the government and entrusting him with the responsibility of the organization and preparing him for the management of elections is an attempt to strengthen the vote bank of the youth by advancing CM Akhilesh in the name of development

 olympic medalist sina nehvalpadam bhushan aword ke liye aavedan khaarij kiye jane se niraash hai
 He questioned the Sports Minister why his name was not sent and also requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to look into the matter

 Saina, who was awarded the Padma Shri in the year 2010, said, 'I have heard that Sushil Kumar's name has been sent for awards as a special case, while the Sports Ministry has not sent my name to the Ministry of Home Affairs
 mantralay ke dishanirdesh kehete hai ki do padam puraskaron ke bich main paanch saal kaa antar hona chahie
 So if they can send his name then why didn't they recommend my name, i have completed five years
 mujhe bura lag rahaa he
 '24-year-old Saina claimed that her application was rejected on the same basis last year but this year the ministry decided to recommend Sushil's name even though he has not met the five-year gap rule
 susheel ko 2011 main padam shri mila tha
 Saina asked, 'last year when i sent my file for Padma Bhushan, the ministry said,' No, Saina, you cannot apply this year because you have not completed five years for it
 ’ isliye maine is baar puraskaron ke liye dobaaraa aavedan diya
 Then why my name was not recommended after this
 ’unhone kaha, ‘2010 ke baad maine kaamanwealth games main gold medal, badminton main pehla olympic medal, kariyar kii best duusari ranking or kaaphi saare super siries khitaab jite isliye mujhe lagata he ki main bhi hakdaar thi
 But even if the name is not sent in this case, it feels bad
 ’sina ne kaha, ‘maine ucchadhikariyon ke saath baat kii
 He said that Sushil's name has already been sent
 main sirf unase is maamle par gaur karne kaa aagrah kar sakati hum
 It would be nice if both of us could get the award
 agar uskaa naam vishesh maamle ke taur par bheja ja saktaa he to meraa naam kyon nahin bheja gaya kyonki agar ve niyamon ke mutabik bhi chalate to meraa naam bheja janaa chahie tha
 Saina said she would be happy if both her and Sushil get the award
 unhone kaha, ‘susheel mahaan khilaadi he lekin medal to medal hota he, ham donon ne olympic main medal jite hai
 If they were to award that particular case, they could have done so after the 2012 Olympics
 ve ab aisa kyon kar rahe hai
 i am disappointed

 Defeated
 samarvira ne sanbhale rakhaa ek chorasrilanka kaa toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji kaa faisla tab galat lagane laga tha jab usne 26wein over tak 69 ran par paanch wicket ganvaa diye the lekin samarvira ne ek chor sanbhale rakhaa or 124 gend par 104 ran kii bejod pari kheli jisamen das chauke shaamil hai
 He shared a 127-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Angelo Mathews (51), helping the Sri Lankans to a respectable score of 216 for seven
 aar premdasa stadium kii oochaal leti pich par newjiland ke liye yah score bhi everest jaisaa ban gaya or 41 ran par chah wicket ganvaane ke baad uski puri team 36

 tej gendbaajon ke anukool rahi pichapich tej gendbaajon ke anukool lag rahi thi jisase donon tiimon kii shuruyaat acchhee nahin rahi
 In such a situation where Sri Lanka got the salvage as Samaraweera, Elliot remained at the crease for two hours from New Zealand but he also struggled to score runs due to falling wicket from the other end
 chah over main keval paanch ran dekar ek wicket lene vaale tilan tushaara ne duusare over kii duusari gend par hi jesi rider ko elbeadblyoo karke newjiland ko pehla jhatka diya
 While Kulasekara sent Martin Guptill (3) and Ross Taylor (2) to the pavilion in the fifth over, the score was reduced to seven for three
 brandan maikulam or iliyat ne iske baad agle 13 over tak wicket nahin girane diya lekin is bich unhone keval 30 ran jode
 The answer was that an aggressive batsman like mccullum faced only 14 runs off 52 balls
 maalinga ne aise maukey par kahar barapaakar rahi sahi kasar puri kar di
 The fast bowler picked up three wickets within five balls in the 19th over of the innings, taking New Zealand to 41 for six

 New Zealand's last hope also ended after Daniel Vettori (10) was dismissed
 jayasoorya ne kiwi captain ko out karne ke baad iliyat kii sanghasharpurn pari kaa ant kiya or phir ian butler (25) ko bold karke newjiland kii pari sameti
 Sri Lanka did not start well before Sri Lanka lost the wicket of opener Tillakaratne Dilshan in the first over, who was bowled by Darrel Tuffy
 shen band ne phir se gendbaaji main kamaal dikhaaya or 43 ran dekar teen wicket liye
 He gave the second blow to Sri Lanka by getting Mahela Jayawardene (0) caught in the first slip by Taylor in the second over
 aathven over main sanath jayasoorya ne band par cat karne ke prayaas main third main par ian butler ko aasaan kaich thamaya jisase score teen wicket par 22 ran ho gaya
 Butler then sent a pavilion to captain Kumar Sangakkara, whose Oram took a good catch by racing, while Vettori created a panic in the Sri Lankan camp by sending Thilan Kadambi (15) to the pavilion
 iske baad maithyuj krij par utre or unhone pari ko sanvaarane main samarvira kaa puraa saath diya
 Matthews faced 60 balls and sent the ball across the boundary line four times
 in donon ne kisi tarah kaa jokhim nahin uthaaya tathaa ek or do ran banaakar score board chalyman rakhaa
 Bond broke this partnership by bowling Matthews
 iske baad 49wein over main samarvira bhi butler kii gend par bold hokar pavilion laute
