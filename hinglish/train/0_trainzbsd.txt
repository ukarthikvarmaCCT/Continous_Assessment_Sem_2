 BJP MP Janardan Mishra on Monday made a controversial statement in the debt waiver case of farmers of Madhya Pradesh
 news agency eenai ke khabar ke mutabik madhya pradesh sarkaar (madhya Pradesh Government) par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki jo pulicekarmi kisaanon se karj vasuulne ke liye pahunchenge, unka galaa ghont diya jaae or unke haath tod die jaaenge
 Speaking in the party's 'kisan Aakrosh Movement', Janardan Mishra accused the state government of working against the farmers
 mishra ne kaha, "agar congress yaa police main se koi bhi badla lene ke makasad se kisaanon ke paas aata he, to unke haath tod die jaaenge or unki galaa dabaakar hatya kar di jaaegi
 BJP workers are standing strong
 "saansad ne aage aarope lagaaya ki rajya main congress sarkaar "vibhaajankaree or vinaashkari" raajnneeti main lagi hui he
 He said, "let me tell you that if Congress does divisive and destructive politics, we will not let this happen and bury destructive politics
" " In the afternoon, a senior colleague of the office told me the news, "husband left his baby with his wife, maiden also turned down", the intro was even more poignant
 usamen likhaa tha, ‘‘besahaara maa ne kaha, apane bachche ke liye kuch bhi karongi'' sheershak puraa hua or unhone kaha, ''pita bachche ko chhod saktaa he lekin kitna hi atyaachaar ho par maa bachche ko nahin chhod sakati
 "is this perception or fact?" Is mother really not able to do this? i thought again and again, many times
 or phir ek nattejey par pahunchi
 Being a mother is not being filled with 'divine power'
 maa hona tyaag kii murti kaa hona bhi nahin
 Not even the idol of mother Mamta
 jaise jindagi main kai jimmedaariyaan sabko uthaani hoti hai vaise hi baccha bhi unamem se ek hota he
 The child is a shared responsibility of the 'parents'
 maa bachche ke zyada or pita bachche ke kam kareeb hoga, maa kii samvednaa pita se zyada hogi, bachche kaa dard maa zyada or pita kam mahasoos karegaa, kori bhaawanaaon par likhi gai in linon kaa vaigyanik aadhaar bilkul bhi nahin he
 Believe me, after talking to many psychologists, i came to the conclusion that these are just assumptions which have nothing to do with facts, they have no scientific evidence
 abhi main mekking of 'maa' ke episod ke clymex ko khoj hi rahi thi ki ek puraane mitra ne mujhase baton hi baton main poocha
 
 
 And now when are you raising a family? i said, the preparations are in full swing
 fat se unhone meri taraf pathar jaisi sakht salaah oochaal phenki
 The advice was something like this, “even if something happens, do not leave the child to be given to the maid
 bhale hi naukari chhod dena
 You will get a job again, but once the seeds of bad values have been sown within the child, then everything will end
 maine kaha nahin, ''main bachche ko cretch main chhodugi, kisi mashhoor company ke cretch main
 
 '' unhone kaha, ''bilkul nahin, cretch main baccha anathon kii tarah padaa rahata he
 "I cursed the mother who was born to me slowly
" mere liye kya bada he baccha yaa meraa kariyar? kariyar thodaa chota shabd he
 Is older, child or non-existent? Ay-hi will i become a selfish 'mother'
 maa banane kaa sukh kya duniya kaa sabase bada sukh nahin? ek maa agar bachche kii parvarish nahin kar sakati to uskaa jeena phijul
 Now in the script of 'making of Mother' running in my mind, i became a villain from a heroine
 mere kaanon main maa se jude saare imotional song bajane lage
 "you are so good, you are so innocent
" 
 
 meri maa
 
 meri maa
 
 
 You have awakened me to all the rituals, mother's love to mother, mother's love, neither do i have any equality in the world
 
 
 ,tujhe sab he pataa meri maa
 
 
 , i decided, i will be a faithful mother
 
 
 
 i will not put any stigma in the mother's lap
 
 
 main samaaj main gadhi gai mamtamayi maa kii tasviir ko bilkul bhi nahin chatkhane duungi
 The climax of 'making of Mother' was almost so close that a friend of mine called
 
 
 or poocha, dear kya haal he
 
 
 i looked at the object and threw a piece of tange like a punch on it
 kaha, ek baat bataa mujhe, tujhe apane bachche ko cretch main rakhte hue shame nahin ai thi
 What kind of a woman is this, you left your child with support
 ab kaise hai tere donon bachche
 He said, what happened after stopping a little? i just told him the script of Making of Mother
 usne kaha, main kal tere ghar apane donon bacchon ko lekar aati hum
 
 
 We will talk about it tomorrow
 uskaa betaa saatvin kaksha or beti paanchavin main padhati he
 Believe me, i spent the whole night preparing to become the 'super Woman' heroine of 'making of Mother'
 duusare din subah 10 baje ghanti baji or meri dost apane do bacchon ke saath mere saamne khadi thi
 My eyes were fixed on both the children
 or dost to mujhe khalanayika hi najar aa rahi thi
 And why not, he had put both children in the crèche as a child
 khayr, baat aage badi or dopaher tak ham saath rahe
 i kept waiting to see when the infiltrates inside these children appeared through the crèche and when i would bash my friend
 meraa intjaar tha ki khatm hone kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa tha
 The friend just said while walking, man, i will just say that don't get addicted to the super 'woman's syndrome'
 maa main koi asamani takat nahin hoti vah bas saamaanya aurat hoti he
 The quality time spent with the children makes the children better and not your excessive sacrifices
 jaisaa ki bachapan se thodi filmi rahi hum
 a dialogue of a Dasharatha Manjhi film echoed in my mind, "is it harder to break the mountain of the baby cradle?" He twisted me, and said, "you are like that, stay the same
" kuch or banane kii koshish main tu apni jindagi ko kathin bana baithegi
 She continued, and yes, it would be better to continue taking time for yourself as well as being a mother, otherwise the expectations of the children will inadvertently put the burden of their sacrifice on their heads
 kyonki bachche keval vyavhaar nahin bhavanaaen bhi samajhate hai
 And yes, this is not just an assumption, many of this research has been done
 kai paper likhe ja chuke hai
 After several days, i started waiting again for my new and most beautiful responsibility by spreading both arms full of cool and confidence

 pehle bhi mili raahat Sleep is the most essential requirement of a person
 bina neend yaa kam neend ke ham kai bimariyon or samasyaon ke shikaar ho sakate hai
 In astrology, sleep and bedside happiness are seen from the lagna, fourth, eighth and twelfth house
 shani neend kaa pramukh grah he
 Apart from this, the Moon, Venus and Mercury are also related to sleep
 jaleey or vaayu rashiyaan bhi neend kii hi rashiyaan hoti hai
 When do you get good sleep? - Due to the dominance of Saturn - being in a good location of the Moon, Venus or Mercury, one gets good sleep - having only auspicious planets in the center or eighth house also leads to good sleep - of the water element in the horoscope
 Sleep is good even when the quantity is strong - people of Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces, Gemini, Libra and Aquarius are usually able to sleep well - Those who have a source of water near their house also sleep well Is there a problem in sleeping? - There is a problem in sleeping due to Saturn's contamination - If the Moon or Venus are afflicted, there is no sleep without reason
 Even if the fire element or the earth element is predominant, the intensity of Mars does not allow you to sleep with physical discomfort

 There is an altercation between the ruling BJP and Shiv Sena on Thursday ahead of an important meeting on Sunday between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah and Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray
 mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne doharaaya ki bhaajapa maharashtra main madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye taiyaar he or vah apane boote jeet darj karegi
 Fadnavis 'statement came in response to a recent statement by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut in which he said his party would withdraw support if the BJP failed to forgive farmers' loans
 fadanvis ne kaha ki "kuch logon ne kaha tha ki ve samarthan waapas le lenge or sarkaar ko gira denge
 We are ready for a mid-term election
 agar ve hamen madhyavadhi chunaav ke liye baadhya karte hai, to mujhe vishwaas he ki ham ek baar phir sarkaar banaaenge
 "finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar made a similar statement at another event
 aapako bataa den kibhartiya janata party(bhaajapa) adhyaksh amit shah ravivaar ko shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare se mulaakaat karenge
 While the main agenda of the meeting between the two leaders may be focused on the upcoming presidential election, party officials said on Thursday that the meeting between the two leaders will take place on Sunday at the Thackeray residence 'matoshree' in Bandra East

 Creating an embarrassing situation for the ruling BJP, its ally Shiv Sena has stood with opposition parties in the state over debt waiver for farmers and other issues related to the state

 The Shiv Sena is also angry with the Chauhan government for not allowing leaders of opposition parties, including Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Gujarat Patidar leader Hardik Patel, from the families of farmers killed in the recent police firing in Mandsaur
 sena ne guuruuvaar ko apane mukhapatron 'saamana' or 'dopaher kaa saamana' main ek sampadakeey main likhaa tha, "yah galat he
 
 agar aise hi jari rahaa, to yah desh ke loktantr ke liye khatra ban jayega
 " mukhyamantri ne kaha ki keval is tarah ke sahaayta package se hi inamen se kai parivaar dobaaraa se apni jindagi shuru karne kii sthiti main honge
 Jayalalithaa, requesting immediate action from the Prime Minister, said, "I would be grateful if you direct the Finance Ministry to immediately formulate a liberal plan and issue appropriate orders and guidelines as per suggestions
" ' The entire opposition, including the Congress, has plagued the Modi government at the Center over the alleged irregularities in the Rafale plane deal, but this is not an issue for Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 nitish kumaar kaa kahana he ki rafel koi mudda nahin he, ab ye baat supreme court ne bhi clear kar di he
 Apart from Rafale, Nitish Kumar also made a big statement about the grand alliance
 bihar ke mukhyamantri bole ki mahagathbandhan kaa koi bhavishya nahin he, bihar main log sirf vikaas ke mudde par vot denge
 Please tell that this statement of Nitish Kumar has come on a day when former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav has called a big meeting of leaders of the grand alliance
 is baithak main tejasvi yadav ke alaava hindustani awam morcha ke jithan ram maanjhi, rashtriya lok samta party ke upendra kushvaha, sharad yadav, congress netaa madan mohan jha shaamil honge

 to vahiin rahul gandhi ne twitor ke jariye HAL ke karmchaariyon kii selary kaa mudda uthaa diya
 The administrative building of Jawaharlal Nehru University was occupied by students for the fourth day
 prashasan ne chaatro se prashasnic bhawan se hatane kii apil karte hue visi se mulaakaat ke liye sahi tarika apnaane ko kaha
 But students opposing the ugc's Gazette notification challenged the JNU administration, saying that unless the VC arrives at Freedom Square and meet the protesting students with written assurances, the administrative building will continue to be occupied
 aapako bataa den ki jeenyu prashasan ne chaatro ko admin block par virodh na karne kii apil kii thi
 In this regard, he had made an appeal on the notice board
 lekin board par jeenyu ke chaatro ne apana hi poster chipka diya
 The students' poster says that the students are ready to adopt any method of protest and rebellion to save JNU
 ye chetavanee he jeenyu ke un chaatro kii jo pichley chaar dinon se jeenyu admin block ke har get par tainaat hai or ujisi gajet notification ke lagu hone par apni naaraazgi jataa rahe hai
 In fact, the students allege that this notification was wrongly passed in the JNU Academic Council meeting
 chaatro ke mutabik agar ujisi notification 2016 ke mutabik nae seshan ke daakhile hote hai to piechdi or emphil main daakhile kii siten kam ho jaaengi
 JNU is bound The JNU administration rejected the allegations of the students and said that the entire process was followed in the AC meeting
 chaatro kii shikaayat ke maddenjar jaruri badlaav bhi shaamil kiye gaye
 Important points were also conveyed to the UGC
 ujisi kaa likhit aadesh he ki sabhi vishvavidhyalayon ko nae gajet notification ko apanaate hue nae seshan ke liye daakhile karne hai
 Therefore, JNU University is bound to believe it
 prashasnic kaamkaaj thappavisi ke oesady ke mutabik prashasnic bhawan se chaatro ko hataane kii lagaataar koshish jari he
 The registrar and the Rector of JNU are also going among the students and advising them to follow the right course
 lekin, chaatr admin block par hi date hue hai
 The situation is that the administrative functioning of JNU is in complete disarray
 iske alaava admin block ke kareeb 300 karmchaaree or adhikari apane karyavadhi main kanvension centre main baithne ko majaboor hai
 Stopping government work is a crime: m Jagadish Kumar, Vice Chancellor, JNU, on one hand, students are not ready to move out of jnu's admin block
 jeenyu visi ne saaf kaha ki sarkari bhawan ko kabje main lenaa yaa sarkari karmchaaree ko kaam karne se rokna bhi ek aparaadh he
 In this case, the student should empty the admin block
 agar chaatr admin block par yun hi date rahe to kanoonee tarika apanaaya jayega
 Now it has to be seen who wins in the battle of student versus JNU administration

 Moving out of the world of Hollywood heroes Superman, Spiderman and Batman, we have a hero since childhood
 bas der he to ek baargi uske charitra ke bare main gaharaai se sochane kii
 The Ramayana cannot be imagined about this character because without him this Ram saga can never be complete
 ham baat kar rahe hai ram bhakt hanuman kii, jo ek hi saath hamen safal jindagi ke kai gur sikhaate hai
 These lessons given by him will never let you lose nor will you ever wander from the right path
 jaane aisa kya he jo hanuman se hamen kya seekhney ko miltaa he
 
 
 1
 sapane bade dekho:hanuman ne jab surya ko aam samaj khaane kii thaanee to sabhi hairaan rah gaye the
 Because this was not possible
 magar is kaam ko bhi unhone sambhav kar dikhaaya
 Of course, this is an event that requires special powers
 lekin sabase badi sikh yah he ki jab yah hanuman ne sochaa tab unhen bhi apni shakti kaa pataa nahin tha
 As a child, he had a big dream and a desire to fulfill it, which he did
 safal hone ke liye aise hi vijan kii jarurat he hamen
 Dream big and give your hundred percent to fulfill them

 Recognize Your Potential: There is an incident in Ramayana when Hanuman was finding himself unable to cross the sea, then Jamwant said to Hanuman, 'be silent
 yani are, hanuman, tum to bahut balavaan ho, tumne chuppi kyon saadh rakhi he
 This was the moment when Hanuman had crossed the sea by recognizing his inner power
 thik aisa hamaare saath bhi hota he, ham aksar khud ko kam aankate hai
 They also compare their skills with others
 lekin hamaare andar bhi vahi kshamta he jo duusare ke paas he
 So always believe in yourself
 3
 It will be good if you do good work: it comes back to us as we do
 iskaa udhaaharan hamen indra kii ore se chot pahunchaae jane ke dauraan miltaa he
 Hanuman suffers a deep injury which also heals
 yahi nahin sabhi devi-devtaa unhen aashirwad dene aate hai
 They get blessings and powers from all
 yah ghatana bataati he ki jivan main achche karm karo to aapke saath acha hi hota he
 4
 bina kisi swaarth ke kaam karnaa:ram se milakar hanuman ne unhen apana guru maan liya tha
 Hanuman remained selfless in everything from carrying Ram to Lanka until coming to Ayodhya
 yah sab unki bhakthi hi to thi, jiske liye unhone sab kiya
 It is very important to have this thing in life because we often start seeing our benefits associated with it before starting the work
 yaad rakhen, kaam karo lekin swaarth bhav se nahin, puri nishtha se
 5
 paristhiti ke saath khud ko badalanaa:ramayana main kai aisi ghatnaayen he, jahaan hanuman ne is baat ko samajhaayaa he ki har baar paristhiti ke saamne ade rahanaa samaadhaan nahin hota he
 When things are not in our hands, then understanding the situation, changing oneself is the biggest solution to the problem

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne somvaar subah sangh pramukh ke bayaan kaa video share karte hue unpar hamalaa bolaa
 However, clarifying on this statement from the Sangh, it has been said that the statement of the Sangh chief has been misrepresented

 Rahul wrote that this is an insult to our tricolor
 rahul ne is bayaan ko sharmnaak bataaya or maafee maangane kii baat kahi
 The RSS Chief's speech is an insult to every Indian, because it disrespects those who have died for our nation
 It is an insult to our flag because it insults every soldier who ever saluted it
 Shame on you Mr Bhagwat, for disrespecting our martyrs and our army

 The government had tapped Neera's phone conversation following a complaint in the Finance Ministry
 shikaayat main kaha gaya tha ki vah kathith taur par rashtravirohi gatividhiyon main lipt he
 The petitioners have stated in their petition that the disclosure of the entire contents of these tapes is also in the public interest as it may reveal the entire cycle of corruption between politicians, bureaucrats, corporate veterans, business houses and even journalists
 
 unhone is baat par bhi jor diya he ki nira se jude tepon ko saarvajanik karne se sambhavat: oonche sthanon par jami bhrashtachar kii paraten khulengi

 Tata had filed a petition seeking an inquiry into the leak of the tape, to which the Center responded
 centre ke is jawaab ke baad tata ne yah halafanama daakhil kiya tha
 Industrialist Tata had said that his taped conversation could not be preserved and its outreach to outsiders is not a part of our great law tradition
 tata ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki centre kaa ucch nyaayalay main daayar halafanama, sarkaar kaa yah rukh pesh karata he ki haalanki aisi tap kii hui saamagree kaa sangrakshan kanoon ke mutabik jaruri he, par aisa na ho paane or iske bahari logon tak pahunchane kii haalat main inhen waapas laane ke liye sarkaar kii ore se koi kadam nahin uthaaya jaataa or na hi is baat kii jaanch hoti he ki yah kaise li hue

 "the biggest awakening in China is that the question of air pollution cannot be left to the next generation
" iskaa asar dikhne bhi laga he
 In February, Peking University, China's most prestigious institution, published a study in collaboration with Greenpeace, which first measured the pollution of microscopic particles in the country's 31 provincial capitals and its immediate impact on health
 iske nattejey chaunkaane vaale the or un par teevr bahes chhid gai
 The study found that 90 out of 100,000 people in these cities may die prematurely due to prolonged breathing in the air suffering from "high levels of microscopic dust pollution"
 '' iskaa matlab tha ki china ke 31 sabase zyada viksit shaharon main dhai lakh logon kaa yah hashr ho saktaa he
 The study also pointed out that if the government brings air pollution to a pre-determined national standard, '41 out of 100,000 premature deaths can be avoided'
 'beijing main lagata he, baat suni ja rahi he
 China's fight against air pollution is a historical event in many ways
 yah birla udhaaharan he, jab prachand jan bhaavana ne ek-daleey shashan vaale china main sarkari niti ke ravaie ko badal diya
 The public outcry over the first haze forced Beijing's government to reveal to people the pollution data collected from different sites throughout the city every day
 isse bhi ahm yah ki sarkaar ko vaayu pradooshan se nibatane ke liye gambhir dirghakaalik kadam uthaane ke liye baadhya kar diya gaya
 The government adopted a two-stage approach
 chote str par shahar-dar-shahar beijing ke nakshekadam par chalate hue kaaron par paabandiyaan lagaai ja rahi hai
 These restrictions are of two types: first, like Beijing, the number of days of car use is limited based on the license number plate (car owners have to park their vehicles at home once a week); And secondly, the registration of new vehicles is tightened and every month a limited number of lotteries are selected and the vehicles are registered
 shanghai or guanjhou ne bhi kaaron ke masik panjikaran kii seemaa baandh di he, yahaan license nilaamee se die jate hai
 These measures have undoubtedly affected, as revealed by the asia-pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC) summit held in November hosted by Beijing

 The result: blue skies appeared throughout the fortnight
 lekin kaaron se zyada badi samasya koyale se chalane vaale kaarkaane hai, jo china ke shaharon ko urja dete hai
 China has taken the initiative to shut down old factories — whose energy capacity is also low — in three provinces around Beijing
 dirghakaalik yojana koyale par nirbharta kam karne kii he
 The government's new National Energy Plan, announced in November 2014, states that it aims to reduce the contribution of coal to the country's energy needs from the current 70 percent to 62 percent

 The plan sets ambitious targets to expand hydropower and nuclear power, so as to reduce the dominance of existing coal in terms of energy
 china is vakt 28 parmaanu urja sanyantr laga rahaa he, jo kisi bhi duusare desh se zyada hai

 anil kumble ne beshak antarrashtriya cricket ko alavida kah diya he lekin gendbaaji unke liye mishan kii tarah rahi he
 India's Today's Sports Editor Sharda Ugra spoke to Kumble, the country's highest wicket-taker, Here's a key piece: How is your shoulder feeling and what? Of course he will miss the bowling, but what are you really missing? What are you waiting for now instead? Will you miss the gym in the morning? i think the shoulder feels relaxed! And once my finger stitches are opened, i will probably return to the gym, just to keep myself fit
 beshak, mujhe team, dressing room, test match or isi tarah kii tamaam chizon kii kami khalegi
 But i have to look forward and this is the right time for this
 mere liye ab jindagi shuru hogi
 i want to relax for some time and ponder
 main khush hum ki mujhe ab ghar par rahanaa he or rosemara kii chijen kerani he, masalan bacchon ko skool chhodana, unhen waapas laana
 
 
 
 main photographer kii apni kaabiliyat ko nikhaarana chahta hum, abhi to yah sirf shauk he lekin ab main iske bare main kuch or siikhnaa chahta hum
 
 
 See what i can do yadi main kuch acchhee tasviren ikattha kar sakaa tab main sambhawatah ek pradarshnee lagaaungaa taaki uske jariye saamaajik kaary ke liye dhan ikattha kar sakuun
 You had far more pressure than the spinners of the past - including both Test and ODI
 akraman ke liye captain puri tarah se aap par nirbhar rahete the
 How did all these factors affect your bowling? It did not matter, i was always looking for a wicket
 phir chaahe main kasaavat ke liye gendbaaji karata tha yaa jaldi wicket lene ke liye, mere dimag main sirf ek hi baat hoti thi ki mujhe wicket lenaa he
 Nothing has changed in this, i have never looked at average, i have never thought that today i have not taken a single wicket or why i should do 30 overs on the first day, it is the job of fast bowlers
 
 
 jab kabhi captain ne mujhe gend thamai maine gendbaaji kii
 It used to be an opportunity for me to take wickets
 yadi kisi tarah kii mushkil hoti thi tab main captain ke paas jaataa tha or usase kahata tha, mujhe gend do ''main tumhaare liye wicket lene kii koshish karuunga
 "what were the most difficult years for you in cricket: joining the team and proving yourself?" The withdrawal phase after surgery in the year 2000 or the recent few years in which you had to try to keep your body fit? Actually all these at different stages
 sabase pehali baar khelte samay mujhe yakeen tha ki main bhi vahaan ja saktaa hum or match jeet saktaa hum lekin jab logon ne pehali baar mujhe dekha to laga ki unhen mujh par bharosa nahin he
 i decided that i had to prove it so that they could say that they could look at me
 03-04 kii australia shrinkhalaa se thik pehle kaa daur bhi chunauteepurn tha
 Because people were thinking that my innings was over
 australia daure ke baad ke chah-saat maheene bhi sharir ko chust rakhane ke lihaaj se kaaphi mushkil the
 i can guess that fate is not with me, i have no regrets, possibly because i have gone through rigorous training, like the hard work i ever did with Paul Chapman at NCA
 maine khud ko majboot banane ke liye gym main kaaphi mehnat kii he
 i had to spend a lot of time recovering from my injuries, it is important to keep myself fit, especially when you are growing old
 mere sanyas lene ke peeche sirf ungali kii chot hi mukhya kaaran nahin thi lekin yah ek aisa kaarak tha jisane mere faisle ko majbootee di
 Because of the finger, i was not ready for the Test against Australia in Nagpur
 iske ek maheene baad hi england kii team ek maheene ke daure par aa rahi he
 i thought that i would have to be agile throughout this phase and keep myself ready
 maine kaha, ise bhul jaao
 i have no regrets
 varsh 2002 main trinidad main antim 11 main aapaki jagah harbhajan singh ko jagah di gai thi
 Was that the low point of your career? After all, how did you get over it? Of course, i thought so
 kyonki toss se pehle tak mujhe bataaya gaya tha ki main khel rahaa hum
 i played the last match and Harbhajan was not fit
 trinidad ke liye ve feet ho gaye lekin mujhe hi khelaane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 John (wright, coach) came to me and he told me that you are playing
 iske baad saurav toss ke liye chale gaye, vahaan kuch baatcheet hui or phir mujhe baahar kar diya gaya
 i know that as a captain you have to make your choice and it is often not easy
 lekin mujhe lagata he ki yah baat mujhe achche tareeke se bataai ja sakati thi
 i also told Sourav that it would have been much easier had he come and say this to me
 baad main unhone mujhase kaha bhi ki yah mushkil faisla tha
 We won that test and i did not play in the subsequent match either
 iske baad antigua hua or main sochataa hum ki meri sari bhavanaaen baahar nikal ain
 i had not played the previous matches and it would have been a difficult period for me on my return home
 vyaktigat taur par main bure daur se guzar rahaa tha, isliye jab meraa jabada tutaa, tab sambhawatah meri bhavanaaen baahar aa gai
 Maybe this was my way of telling myself that i can still do the ball
 iske alaava hamane pehle ballebaaji kii thi or 6,00 se zyada ran banaae the or us samay tak hamane bharat se baahar adhik baar itane ran nahin banaae the
 When the bowler hit the ground, he knew that we had runs
 apane 18 varsh ke kareer main aapane ballebaaji main kis tarah kaa badlaav dekha? kya takanic kamjor pad gai he or ballebaaj zyada se zyada jokhim uthaanaa chaahate hai? gendbaajon, khaas taur se spinneron ke liye kisi chunauti he, choti boundry or baari balle or ab simit overon kaa khel?sari duniya main ballebaajon ke liye wicket aasaan ho gai he
 This is the trend and the bowlers want to dominate the ball
 shaayad hi koi aisa wicket banaaya jaataa ho jisase spin yaa tej gendbaajon ko madad mili
 So the run average has become better, if you look at the statistics on the basis of runs per wicket or per over, then you will see a change in my bowling in the last five years, taking wickets has become expensive
 yahi puri duniya kaa haal he
 The score is usually 100 / 1 until lunch break, compared to 60 / 4 or 60 / 2 previously
 aise bahut kam match hote hai jin par gendbaajon kaa kabja hota he
 You got captaincy late
 is jimmedaari ke saath sabase kharaab cheez kya thi? sidney kaa maamla? srilanka kii naakaami? yaa phir aakhri ke kuch maheene jab senior khilaadiyon par dabaav badha or aapane gusse main kollam likhaa?maine jimmedaari kaa anand uthaaya
 i thought i needed to do some things, like talking to the media and protecting the interests of the players
 main logon ko khilaadiyon kaa najariya bataanaa chahta tha
 It is important that i honestly express whatever i feel in the interest of the team and cricket is a team sport in every sense
 kai baar hataasha hui kyonki main nahin sochataa ki captain or ek team ke rup main mujhe logon ko har cheez kaa spashtikaran dene kii jarurat he
 If a decision has been taken then you can criticize it, analyze it but you do not have to question the intention behind it
 main nahin sochataa ki mujhe duniya ko yah bataane kii jarurat he ki team kii baithkon main kya baat hui, ballebaajon ko kya sandesh bheje gaye
 
 
 There is strategy in the game and it is part of that
 main sochataa hum ki sidney se nibatna kaaphi mushkil thah captain ke rup main mujhe maidan main faisle lene padate the lekin yahaan to mujhe maidan se baahar bhi kuch faisle karne pade
 But the team was united, the BCCI gave us full support
 maine khel ko sabase upar rakhkar eemaandaaree se jimmedaari nibhaai
 Sri Lanka's failure was really difficult
 hamaare ballebaaj chal nahin rahe the or ham thik se kaich nahin lapak rahe the
 Our fielding has always been average and we have been good and very good in catching catches but we failed in Sri Lanka
 jahaan tak stambh kii baat he to team kii ore se bayaan jari karnaa ahm hota he taaki puri team kaa najariya saamne aa sake
 Much has been said about India's system and how cricketers are polished
 aapke lihaaj se hamaari vyavastha kii khamiyaan or takat kya hai? har koi kahata he ki australia ke paas safalataa kaa sancha he; hamen uskaa kitna anusaran karnaa chahie?is bare main meraa kuch bhi kahana jaraa jaldbaaji hogi
 We have our own strength, our structure of junior cricket is very strong, Under 15, Under 19 cricket being played in the format of Ranji Trophy is a good thing
 main maanata hum ki aap ghanton net par kharch karne ke bajaae zyada se zyada match khel kar hi sikh sakate hai
 The National Cricket Academy is doing a good job, even though it is just their beginning
 kshetreey academiyaan bhi kaam kar rahi hai
 i think we can be more professional but this is just the beginning of the journey
 hamen baithkar yah vichaar karne kii jarurat he ki bharat main jitani bhi pratibhaaen hai un sabhi par kaise dhyaan jaae

 Sources said that the report also talked about investigating the role of former Chief Minister and JDS leader HD Kumaraswamy and Congress Rajya Sabha MP Anil Lad
 hazaron pannon kii is report main sibiai or iskar vibhaag se mili jaankaree bhi shaamil kii gai hai
 Both these departments had investigated the case of illegal mining
 uttar pradesh ke bahucharchit khanan ghotaalaa maamle main kendriya anveshan beuro (CBI) ne buudhvaar ko chhapemari kii
 These raids were killed at the residence of District Magistrate (DM) Abhay Kumar Singh of Bulandshahr
 khanan maamle main abhaya kumaar singh bhi radar par the, aise main sibiai ne ab karrwai kii he
 Explain that this is the case when the Samajwadi Party government was in the state and Akhilesh Yadav was the Chief Minister of the state
 buudhvaar ko sibiai ne bulandshahr, lakhanu, fatehpur, azamgarh, elahabaad, noida, gorakhpur, devaria main chhapemari kii
 During this time CBI has registered a case against Bulandshahr DM Abhay Singh
 unke alaava devaria ke dm vivek ke khilaaf bhi cese darj hua he
 Rs 47 lakh has been recovered from Abhay Singh's residence, while Rs 10 lakh has been recovered from the house of ADM Devisharan Upadhyay of Deoria
 jiske chalate sibiai team ne ab note ginaney kii mashin bhi mangai thi
 The CBI team went to raid the Bulandshahr dm's house with complete preparation
 is dauraan 4 gaadiyaan vahaan pahunchi thi, jinamein se do gaadiyaan jaruri dastauez ko apane saath le gai he
 Two vehicles are still in the house and inquiries are on

 At that time the Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was handling the responsibility of the Ministry of Mining
 aise main unpar bhi lagaataar sawaal uthte rahe hai
 Abhay Singh has been the DM of Fatehpur from September 2013 to June 2014
 abhaya kumaar singh 2007 batch ke upi cader ke IAS adhikari hai
 Apart from Bulandshahr, he has also been DM of Fatehpur, Rae Bareli and Bahraich
 abhaya kumaar singh ke kariyar kii puri detailsutron kii maane to 2012 or 2016 ke bich kul 22 tender paas kiye gaye the, jo vivaad main aae
 Out of these 22, 14 tenders were passed when the Ministry of Mining was with Akhilesh Yadav
 baaki ke maamle gayatri prajapati ke kaarykaal ke hai
 Now the agencies believe that they were given on lease only after the approval of Akhilesh Yadav and Gayatri Prajapati
 kyonki 5 lakh se upar kaa koi bhi masalaa ho, uske liye mukhyamantri kii ijaajat jaruri he
 Earlier in June, the CBI had also investigated Gayatri Prajapati's house in the same case
 is maamle main sibiai kaaphi active he or desh ke alag-alag hisson main chhapemari kar chuki he
 Apart from Gayatri Prajapati, IAS officer BS Chandrakala's house was also raided

 This is not a sermon, the three wisdom sources of BJP veteran LK Advani, which he shared on the release of his three books on Tuesday
 ye kitaaben adwani ke blog post kaa sankalan hai
 Among them, the title of the English book is 'my Take' and the names of Hindi books are 'nation paramount' and 'approach'
 86 saal ke adwani ne kaha ki mujhe apane jivan ke myne or khushi donon mil gaye hai
 He said that the criticisms also helped me to move forward
 apni kattarpanthi chhavi kaa zikr karte hue adwani bole ki jab main 2005 main pakistan gaya, to iljaam laga diya gaya ki maine apni party kii vichaardhaara ke khilaaf baghawat kar di he
 Senior BJP leaders including RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat were also present at Advani's function
 adwani bole ki ye meraa saubhaahgya he ki yahaan us sanghathan ke pramukh aae hai, jiske saath main 14 saal kii umr se judaa hua hum
 Advani does what he says, after opening a front against Modi on this occasion, Bhagwat, who persuaded Raut Advani, said that what these BJP leaders say, they do
 bhagwat bole ki yah sabit ho chukaa he ki adwani kii raajnneeti or shabdon main raashtra hit sabase upar hota he
 Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj, who was counted in the Advani camp, said that we did not think he would be able to write with such consistency
 jis tarah ke vividh vishyon par unhone likhaa he, main usase aashcharya chakit hum
 On the blog, when lightening the atmosphere on the question of criticizing the party, Sushma said that our opposition gets happy after reading this

 nai dillih sahityapremiyon kaa 'katha-kahani' naamak samooh har maah ek goshtee karaata he
 Senior narrators Pankaj Bisht and Satyendra Srivastava narrated their stories written on the occasion of this month's event at Gandhi Peace Foundation, on which the literary enthusiasts also presented their views
 is avasar par pankaj bisht ne apni kahani 'aisi jagah' kaa paath kiya to yuva kathakaar satyendra shrivastav ne apni kahani ‘premium’ sunai
 Critic Sanjeev Kumar commented on these stories, saying that the story is one that raises the big questions of his time
 lekin yahaan sawaal yah bhi to uthta he ki in sawaalon kaa bada hona koun tay karata he? kya koi darshan, koi vichaardhaara, koi party line sawaalon kaa bada hona tay karti he? sanjeev ne kaha ki pankaj bisht kii kahani asaadhaaran hone kii jhalak detii he
 When the inspector gets the part that 'now is your responsibility, do whatever you want', it is from here that the story begins and then raises big questions
 satyendra shrivastav kii kahani ke bare main unka mat tha ki yah kahani taarkikta se aage badhati he
 There is time and space unity in this story
 puri kahani gathi hui he
 Does not divide anywhere
 ek samay main puri kii puri kahani khatm hoti he
 He said that the post-liberalization issues emerge in this story
 unhone kahani main udaarikrut bharat se nikali hui upamaaon jaise ‘bampar apher’, ‘safedposh majdoor kii tarah baghawat’ kii prashansa kii
 Poetry Savita Singh while narrating the story that disturbs Pankaj Bisht's story, said that this story promulgates death
 ramesh upaadhyaay kaa kahana tha ki satyendra shrivastav kii kahani main shuru se aakhir tak ek chintaa he
 The specialty of this story is that this story tells about death, but this story is about life
 unhone kaha ki aaj kii poonjivadi vyavastha vyakti ko is tarah jakad leti he ki vah na to kuch kar sakane kii sthiti main rahata he or na hi kuch soch paane kii sthiti main rahata he
 The story indicates how life is mortgaged in the capitalist system and the person becomes a slave to this system
 yah aaj ke jivan kaa yatharth he ki kamaate raho, duusare kaa pet bharte raho or ek din mar jaao
 On the story of Pankaj Bisht, Ramesh Upadhyay said that when the story starts, an interestingness arises and the story gets itself read with full vigor
 par kahani padhane par yah nahin pataa chalata ki yah kiski kahani he? marane vaale kii kahani he? yaa inspector kii kahani he? agar marane vaale kii kahani he, to yah rahasy aakhir tak pataa nahin chalata ki marane vaala koun tha? uske jivan kaa yatharth kya tha? or inspector kii kahani he to yah nahin pataa chal paata ki inspector kaa marane vaale se kya or kis tarah sambandh tha? lekin jis yatharth kaa tanabana kahani main buna gaya he, usase yah sanket miltaa he ki inspector marane vaale ko apane pita ke rup main dekhtaa he
 The inspector, suffering from a guilt, donates his body as if donating his father's body
 agar yah kahani is rup main likhi jaati to ek badi kahani ho sakati thi
 Speaking on the story of Pankaj Bisht, Shankar said that three sides emerge in this story
 ek paksh to inspector kaa he, jo kartavya parayan or samvedansheel he or mare hue aadmi ko dekhakar bhaavnaatmak rup se apane pita ko yaad karata he
 The other side is of the man who is dead
 usne marane ke liye vahi jagah kyon chuni
 There could be a reason that there must have been some disappointment in his life and there is apathy behind his death
 kahani ko is tarah se bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Bedilli of Delhi is the third party to this story
 kahani main varnit shmashaan dilli kaa roopak he
 This Delhi is so insensitive
 yah dikhaanaa bhi kahani kaa makasad ho saktaa he
 But the story does not appear to stand with any of the three metaphors in its structure
 baavjood iske bhi yah kahani desh kaal kii kahani ban jaati he or hamaare samay ke bade sawaalon ko uthaati he
 Regarding the story of Satyendra Srivastava, Shankar believed that the story is so tight that even a single sentence cannot be extracted from this story
 yah bade falak kii kahani he
 It is also the story of the new economic policies that came after 1982
 satyendra shrivastav kii kahani par bolte hue vivekanand ne kaha ki kahani main vahiin rin chakra he, jiskaa ullekh premchand ne apane katha sahitya main kiya he
 But there should have been a character in this story who is not
 lekhak kahani ke saath nyaay nahin kar sakaa
 Commenting on these stories, Yogendra Ahuja said that today's seminar is special in the sense that we have learned to write a little while reading the stories of Pankaj Bisht
 kahani sunakar mujhe shiddat se ehsaas hua ki ‘samyaantar’ ne beshak hamaare vakt kii bahut sari jaruri bahason main hissedari yaa hastkshep kiya he, lekin isaki paryaapt keemat kahaniyon se, kahaniyon kii duniya se vasula he, use kuch garib banaaya he
 Commenting on the story of Satyendra Srivastava, he quoted a statement by Raghuvir Sahai that although the erosion of democracy had begun, the expectations had not disappeared as they have today
 is kahani main shikari kutton kii tarah peechha karte mahajan or bank or lenders hai, jo ek vetan ke din se duusare vetan ke din tak mahanagar main naukari karte ek shaks kaa peechha karte hai
 For a white collar jobber in a big city, this is the gift of free market system and neo-liberalism
 jise na biimaar padane kaa haq he na marane kaa
 He has to do the job just after facing all the insults
 biimaar pad gaya to parivaar sadak par aa jaayegaa
 And to die will not be less than a crime
 vah apane bhay se, asuraksha se nijaat paane ko phir ek polisy le letaa he or us dushchakra main or bhi gahare dhans jaataa he
 The noose around his neck tightens some more
 kya is dushchakr se baahar aana sambhav he, or yadi haa, to iskaa rasta kya he yah kahani nahin kahati
 Which is not even necessary at all
 ek yatha tathy bayaan vaale sade shilp main yah dil dahala dene vaali kahani har pathak kaa der tak peechha karegi
 Speaking on the story of Pankaj Bisht, Yogendra Ahuja said that this story is an everyday common situation for a police officer
 ek padtaal ke silsile main vah dilli main ek bade or vyast shmashaan pahunchataa he, jahaan chaaron taraf mrityu he
 There is no indication of the identity of that person
 phir laash se ek parchi girti he, jis par ek aspasht sa sandesh he- ab tumhaari jimmedaari he, jo chaaho karo- vah bhi kisi khaas ko sambodhit nahin
 Despite what is written in that slip, the police officer catches his signs despite not being clear
 vah samaj jaataa he ki hataasha, akelepan or noummidi ne uski jaan lee he
 He remembers his father, with whom he had no communication
 ab us laavaaris laash se uskaa rishta sirf ek daftari yaa routini rishta nahin rah jaataa
 a human relationship is formed
 yah kahani insaan kii udaseenta yaa berukhi kii kahani nahin he
 In spite of all the selfishness within humans, there is a story of never ending possibilities
 donon kahaniyon par tippanee karte hue ramsharan joshi ne gaalib kaa ek sher uddhrut kiya ki ‘ho chuki gaalib balaayein sab tamaam, ek marg-e-nagahani or he
 'he said that both these stories express political economy
 unhone kaha ki moort sahitya vah he jo apane samay kii vyavastha ke viruddh ek pratirodh kaa roopak gadhe
 Both these stories are stories of dehumanization and isolation
 donon kahaniyaan alag-alag samay kii samvedansheeltaa ko hamaare saamne laati hai or vyavastha kii paraton ko maheen dhang se hamaare saamne rakhti he
 Pankaj Bisht has taken the title of his story from this Lion of Ghalib: 'now go to a place where there is no one, we are not Sukhan and there is no one else'
 vyavastha kis tarah vyakti ko amanviya bana detii he, pankaj bisht kii kahani us vyavastha par jabardast tamaacha he
 He said that both stories point to life's physicalities
 unka kahana tha ki satyendra shrivastav ne bahut hi jimmedaar hokar kahani likhi he
 This story negates the whole system and this story becomes the story of the system leading to more deaths than zine
 yah kahani jivan ke un prashnon se hamako jodatii he jinhen ham darkinar kar chuke hai
 Commenting on these two stories, Mahesh Darpan said that both stories point towards the extremes of our lives
 khub kamao, khub khao, aaleeshaan jindagi jeeyo or mar jaao
 The story of Pankaj Bisht is also troubling because this story runs within the person, not in external structures
 is kahani ko likhte samay pankaj bisht ek jimmedaar kahanikar kii bhoomika main hai
 This story also bothers us that what we believe to be humans, how can a human being be, why does he talk about humanity
 system ko nakaarne kaa ek tarika yah bhi he ki main apane marane kaa tarika khud talash karuunga
 This story is the story of the system leading to more deaths than the zine and the story of opposition to this system
 satyendra shrivastav kii kahani ke bare main mahesh darpan kaa maananaa tha ki kahani vahaan banati he, jahaan kahani kaa paatr premium bhar detaa he
 This is a story of a particular mindset, a tension
 unka maananaa tha ki ye donon kahaniyaan hamen jivan ke un prashnon se jodatii hai, jinhen ham darkinar kar chuke hai
 He said that if these two stories are recast, then it can be said that there is a thinking behind the sentences written in the stories
 prempal paal sharma ne kaha ki udaarikaran ne jahaan jivan kii suvidhaayen di hai, vahiin kuch anjaam bhi diye hai
 Stories hold these results firmly
 in donon kahaniyon par bolte hue rakesh bhartiya ne kaha ki pankaj bisht kii kahani acchhee tarah se khulti he or kahani kaa jo paath lekhak ke dimag main he, vahi paath shrota ke man main bhi padataa he
 This is the success of the story
 goshtee main kahaniyon par hui paricharchaa par tippanee karte hue pankaj bisht ne kaha ki maine is kahani main ek adarsh ko kehane kii koshish kii he
 Death is only a medium
 lekin yah kahani ek sambhaavna kii, maanviyata kii kahani he
 i want to tell through the story that there are better people in the society, there is no need to be disappointed

 Bad news for the most road accident in the world, many shocking things have come to light in India after a thorough investigation of road accidents
 sadak parivahan evam rajmarg mantralay ne deshbhar main beete varsh (2016) sadak haadason ko lekar jo report jari kii he, usamen sadak haadason ko lekar kai aise tathy saamne aae hai, jo hamaare anumaan ko palat kar rakh dete hai
 This report of the Ministry of Road Transport on Road Accidents says that the number of educated people was more than the illiterate among the victims of accident
 12veen secom shikshit log behatar driversabit hue, jo sanket detaa he ki driving kaa sidhaa sambandh shiksha se he hi nahin
 Another fact in the report defies our estimate of road accidents
 aam taur par mana jaataa he ki accident kii ashanka raat main hoti he, jab andhera hota he yaa offis jate samay jab sabhi jaldibaji main hote hai
 But surprisingly, most road accidents occur between 3 pm and 6 pm, when there is plenty of natural light on the road
 in teen ghanton ke baad sabase khatarnaak samay he shaam chah baje se raat ke nau baje ke bich kaa
 Most people would think that the risk of accident is high due to fog in winter
 lekin report main pataa chalaa kii sabase zyada accident june main hote hai or iske baad number par aata he march kaa
 Usually we think that if the car is new and better, then the risk of accident will be less and if the car is old worn out, then the risk of accident will also be high
 lekin isamen bhi sachai thik ulat he
 According to the data, the maximum accidents were from vehicles that were less than 5 years old
 aam taur par shant samajha jane vaala chennai sadak haadason ke lihaaj se sabase zyada khatarnaak he
 Among the metros, Chennai has the highest number of accidents
 duusare number par dilli or tisare number par bangalore he
 The least road accident in metros is in Mumbai, where the number of road accidents is half that of Chennai and Delhi
 yuvaaon se ummid kii jaati he ki ve chusti-furti or tej najaron ke chalate sabase kam accident kaa shikaar hote honge
 But as usual in 2016, the most people who died in accident were young people between 25 and 35 years old
 vahiin 2016 main sadak haadason main jaan ganvaane vaale logon main sabase kam sankhya 60 saal se adhik aayu waalon kii thi
 In 2016, 32,609 youth between the ages of 25 and 35 lost their lives in road accidents
 bhartiya janata party ke netaa laalkrishna adwani ne somvaar ko pradhanmantri karyaalay kii is baat ke liye aalochana kii ki ek aalekh main manmohan singh kii aalochana karne vaale videshi patrkaar ko 'pareshaan karne kii koshish' kii ja rahi he
 The BJP leader's target is mainly Pankaj Pachauri, media advisor to the Prime Minister, who was earlier associated with a major television channel
 adwani ne somvaar ko apane blog main likhaa he ki saarvajanik jivan main 'morrkhtaa' bada aparaadh he
 He has said that the case between the PMO and Washington Post correspondent Simon Denair is a high point of disrespect for a man appointed to serve the Prime Minister
 aalekh main kii gai aalochana kii pratikriya main piemo kii koshishon ko pyaale main tufaan khadaa karnaa bataane waalon kii kadi main khud ko shaamil karte hue adwani ne kaha he ki yadi washington post kaa maamla vaaki main bhartiya samvaadadaataaon ko sakht sandesh dene kii koshish he, to samajhie ki iskaa ulataa asar hua he The scorching heat made the people of North India live on Sunday

 Rather, the recent election results may have boosted him slightly
 nateezon kaa nateeja ye hua he ki mamata main gusse kii jagah vinamrata ne le lee he
 After Narendra Modi took over as the Prime Minister, for nine months, Mamata avoided the streets of power in which her shadow was felt somewhere
 thodaa or pehle se dekhen to unke liye mamata ke munh se 'danga babu' auki 'bina dimagvaale netaa' jaise kaside hi sunne ko mila karte the
 Well, all this is now a thing of the past

 Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria reacted to India's failure to put Masood Azhar in the list of 1267 sanctions committee of the UN Security Council, saying that the 1267 committee related to ISIS, Al Qaeda rejected India's politically motivated proposal Have given
 unhone kaha ki halki soochna or aadharahin aaropon se bhare bharat ke prastaav main koi dam nahin tha or iskaa mukhya uddeshy uske sankeern rashtriya agenda ko aage badhanaa tha
 Nafees said that the dismissal of this resolution is also to politicize this important committee of the Security Council and the Indian efforts to reduce its functioning
 pathankot hamale kaa mastermind he masood ajaharjaish-e-mohammad kaa pramukh masood ajahar punjab ke pathankot sthit airforce base par 2016 kii shuruyaat main hue aatanki hamale kaa mastermind he
 India had proposed to declare Masood Azhar a terrorist at the United Nations on 31 March 2016, in which China imposed a hurdle
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke 15 deshon ke samooh main akelaa china hi aisa tha, jisane ajahar ko aatanki ghoshit kiye jane ke faisle ko 'hold' par rakhaa tha
 Due to this, India's plan to ban jaish-e-mohammed was also thwarted
 agar ajahar ko antarrashtriya str par aatanki ghoshit kar diya jaataa he, to uski sampatti fries kar di jayega
 Not only this, his travel will also be banned
 2019 chunaav se pehle phulpur or gorkhupar ke upachunaav ko semifinal mana ja rahaa he
 To defeat the BJP, Mayawati has forgotten the 23-year-old rivalry and is supporting the SP candidate in both the seats
 sapa-basapa ke gathbandhan ko 2019 se pehle ise litmus test ke taur par bhi dekha ja rahaa he
 Only after this election will the foundation of walking with Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati
 vaise hi jaise 1993 main mulaayam singh yadav or basapa ke sansthaapak kanshiram ne saath aakar bijepi ko dhul chataaya tha
 BSP supremo Mayawati called it a 'coalition' but not a vote-share synergy
 phulpur-gorakhpur loksabhaa seat par sapa ummidaar ko basapa kaa samarthan dene kii baat kahi he
 In 1993, Mulayam Singh and Kanshi Ram together succeeded in stopping Ramalhar, but will mayawati-akhilesh now succeed in stopping the Modi wave? Let us share the friendship of mulayam-kanshiram when Mulayam and When Kanshi Ram formed an alliance, the politics of politics was different and the brightness of the two faces was also different
 tab ke daur main mandal ayog ne obisi votaron ko ekajute kiya tha or mulaayam singh kii upi main unka nirvivaad cheharaa ke taur par pahchaan thi
 It is believed that due to this, Dalits and obcs were united and managed to stop Ramalhar
 sapa-basapa hui kamajothakhilesh yadav or mayawati ke liye paristhatiyaan alag hai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, where bjp's account was not opened, Akhilesh's party was able to save only 5 family seats
 iske baad 2017 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main ekbar phir modilhar chali or bijepi ko prachand bahumat ke saath soobe kii satta par viramaan hui
 At the same time, the SP-BSP once again faced a crushing defeat
 1993 main mulaayam-kanshiram ke saath obisi or dalit tabake kii ummiden judi thim, lekin badalte parivesh main akhilesh-mayawati ke saamne obisi or mayawati kii ummiden tuuti hai
 This is the reason why both parties are going through the worst phase
 sapa ko basapa kaa samarthanbiespi pramukh mayawati is gathbandhan ko lekar haalanki jaldbaaji ke mood main nahin dikhaai de rahi hai
 This is the reason why she wants to keep this alliance limited to Rajya Sabha elections and Lok Sabha by-elections
 unhone kaha, '2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se is gathbandhan kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 To prevent BJP in the by-elections and Rajya Sabha elections, the SP has decided to support the BSP and the BSP
 'gauratlab he ki sapa-basapa ke bich upachunaav main gathbandhan kii atakalein kaaphi lambey samay se chal rahi thim
 It was announced by the BSP on Sunday
 haalanki isamen dilachasp pahalu yah he ki congress is gathbandhan se baahar he
 This alliance will help each other, however, there is also a common strategy of both parties regarding the elections to the Rajya Sabha and the Legislative Council seats
 sapa ne basapa ko rajyasabha chunaav main samarthan dene or iske badale basapa ne vidhaan parishad chunaav main sapa ko samarthan dene kaa samjhauta kiya he
 Regarding the 2019 litmus test alliance, National Vice President of SP Kiranmay Nanda said, "communal forces will be defeated in Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections due to the integration of SP and BSP
 bijepi donon siton par upachunaav haarane ja rahi he

 While the reputation of Chief Minister Yogi is at stake in Gorakhpur, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has given his full strength in the Phulpur by-election
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne upachunaav ko lekar hue is gathbandhan ko sire se khaarij kiya he

 ye baat he 10 saal pehle ki jab main college ke dauraan apni khaas dost se milane 14 farvari jane vaala tha
 Both of us had been planning this day for many days
 lekin jab ye din aayaa to subah ghar par phone kii ghanti baji
 My Priya took the first step in our world
 is khabar ko sunakar main bahut khush tha, mere ghar main ye puure jashn kaa maahaul tha
 Then my friend got a call on my phone, he had called to meet
 mainen use priya ke aane kii khushkhabari sunai or kaha 'ham kal milenge,aaj meraa yahaan hona jaruri he
 On hearing this, the phone got disconnected and then the phone did not come till evening
 main samaj gaya tha ki meri dost naaraaz ho gai he lekin sach kahuun to mere paas use samajhane kaa vakt nahin tha
 She was angry with me for many days and she did not talk
 main bhi apane kaamon main mashgool rahaa
 Then after several days we met, my friend was complaining why i did not come to meet him on 14 February leaving behind all the work
 maine samajhane kii koshish to kii, magar phir baat adhuri hi khatm kar di
 i came home with weary footsteps, sitting silently in the rage of my relationship
 tabhi meri bhanji ki hansi mere kaanon main padi or mere haathon ne use uthaa liya
 My sadness had vanished, because the one i left and not the one who was the cause of my laughter was my valentine
 bina bole us maasoom se chehre ne wo sab kah diya jo main soch bhi nahin paaya tha
 Even today i celebrate my valentine with that little angel
 yah kahani he pratik kii

 Air pollution is a major cause of many life-threatening diseases such as stroke, heart diseases, lung cancer and chronic and severe respiratory problems
 ichaemaar uniwarsity main jaipur ke skool of rural management ke professor or dean incharge dow
 Gautam Sadhu said, 'unfortunately, major metros like Delhi, Mumbai, which are the most densely populated cities in the country, are among the most polluted cities in the world
 dilli main particulet matter kaa str 143 microgram prati cubik meter par 2
 5 has been entered, which is 14 times more than the safe limit
 vahiin jaipur or chandigarh main bhi piem kaa str 2
 5 has been recorded, which is much higher than the safe limit
 'unhone kaha, 'yah sookshm pradooshak kan swasthya ke liye behad khatarnaak hai kyonki ye saans ke jariye fefdon main gaharaai tak pravesh kar sakate hai, jiske chalate asthma, shwasan tantra main sujan, fefde kaa cancer or saans se sambandhit anya bimaariyaan bhi ho sakati hai
 The meteorologist says that the recent dust storms are the result of strong storm conditions which persisted overnight, causing extremely high winds and picking up dust and mist along with the already polluted north India
 Further polluted the climate of the cities
 thand ke dinon main vaayu pradooshan kaa str sabase adhik khatarnaak seemaa tak pahunch jaataa he kyonki thand ke dinon main pradooshak tatv dhundh ke saath vaataavaran main jame rah jate hai or inkaa asar chhatne main zyada samay lagata he
 Worldwide, 91 percent of the population lives in places where pollution levels have reached unsafe limits
 maut ke 23 pratishat maamalon kaa sambandh kisi na kisi prakaar se pradooshan se hota he, jise roka ja saktaa he
 Small children, women laborers and elderly people can easily fall prey to the ever-increasing level of air pollution
 pradooshit hawa se aise karen bachaav:1
 If the AQI index is more than 150, avoid exercise, cricket, hockey, cycling, marathon with more physical activity
 pradooshan str ke 200 se zyada hone par park main bhi daudane or tahalne naa jaaen
 Do not walk long distances when the pollution level is more than 300
 jab str 400 ke paar ho to ghar ke andar rahen, saamaanya walk bhi naa karen
 Stay indoors
 pradooshan str 1000 par hone par public health immergency jaise halaat hote hai
 At this stage do not get out of the house at all, stay at home

 Before going out of the house, apply a mask on your face
 selfi ke diwaanon saavdhaan! biimaar bana saktaa he aapako yah shauk3
 Plant more and more trees in your home and nearby areas
 ye hawa ko purifai karne kaa kaam karte hai
 With which you will be able to breathe fresh air

 Water is very important to get the poison out of the breath
 isliye pani pinaa nahin bhoolen
 Drink up to 4 liters of water a day
 ghar se baahar nikalate vakt bhi pani pien
 Due to this, the supply of oxygen in the body will remain correct and even if the toxic gases present in the atmosphere reach the blood, it will cause less harm
 kai rogon kaa ilaaj he mulethi, jaane seven kaa sahi tarika5
 Use vitamin-c, omega-3 as much as possible in food
 shahad, lahasun, adarak kaa khaane main zyada se zyada istemaal karen
 In the condition of cough, cold, consume honey and ginger juice
 6
 If coming out of the house is your compulsion then after coming home, clean the mouth, eyes and nose with lukewarm water
 baahar se aane ke baad bhaap bhi le sakate hai
 7
 jab tak pradooshan he tab tak bacchon ko baahar khilne naa nikalne den
 Avoid cycling, do not walk too long

 If there is a problem of phlegm, take black pepper mixed with honey

 Pregnant women wear masks even during their stay at home

 Pollution levels are high in the morning, so do not go on the morning walk
 dhoop nikalne ke baad hi baahar hi nikalen
 Do not get out of your motorcycle or bicycle

 adaalat se bhale na sabit ho magar inke ghotaale ke saamne unke ghotaale ke aaropon ko rakh die jaaen to donon ghotaale kaa asar samaapt ho jaataa he
 At least anchors get the right amount of material for the TV debate

 This order was touted as a big success and politics started to heat up
 abhi philhal ke liye is khabar main kaaphi kuch bhandol ho gaya he
 Nidhi Razdan and Nita Sharma on Wednesday evening reported that a Dubai court has not ordered Christian Mitchell to be taken to India
 adaalat ne yun hi tippanee kii thi jiskaa sambandh khaastaur se mishael se bhi nahin tha
 But on Tuesday, several reporters broke the news citing sources
 channelon par charchaaen shuru hone lageen or akhabaaron main bhi subah-subah mote mote font main chap gayi
 Then how did this confusion happen? to kya agenciyon ne kisi or iraade se bhartiya patrakaron ko yah khabar di thi taaki dhyaan hat jaae
 Many journalists were also writing on Twitter that this matter has been brought to the fore so that it can be equal to the Rafale controversy
 tabhi buudhvaar dopaher hamaari sahyogi sunetra choudhary ne ek khabar brake kar di ki mishael to laapata ho gaya he
 He is not aware of anything
 is saal july main mishael ke vakil ke hawaale se khabar chhapi thi ki bhartiya agencia mishael par dabaav daal rahi hai ki vah sonia gandhi kaa naam le le
 The CBI denied this
 philhal mangalvaar ko jo news brake hui thi wo buudhvaar aate aate broken ho chuki he
 It seems that a lot will change in this news
 hamane kai mantriyon ke twitor handle ko check kiya
 If this news is so big, then the Ministry of Home Affairs, Home Minister and Minister of State for Home would have tweeted
 kisi ne nahin kiya
 While it was published in the newspapers that the Indian government has started speeding up the Agusta case
 kanoon mantri grih mantralay se check kar lete ki tathy kya hai
 Then giving a statement in the media
 agusta westland helikafter kareed kaa maamla 2012 se chal rahaa he
 Started from Italy and when India arrived, there was an uproar
 italy main kahaan he yah maamla or bharat main kahaan he yah bhi jaan lenaa chahie
 Finmeccanica is an Italian company that makes defense goods
 isi kii ek sahaayak company he agusta westland jisase 12 viviipi helicopter kareedne ke liye bharat sarkaar ne 2010 main qaraar kiya tha
 In 2012, the matter appears in the Italian press itself that the deal worth Rs 360 to 450 crores has been given in this deal of 3600 crores
 italy ke atarani general jaanch shuru karte hai
 Allegations have surfaced in the Italian press that middleman Guido Ralph Hashke brokered agustawestland to get the deal done
 hashke bhi giraftaar hua
 Former Italian president g Orci and former CEO of Agusta Westland Bruno Spagnolini were also arrested in Italy
 unke khilaaf maamla chalaa
 He was also sentenced in a lower court in Italy, but in December 2016, the Supreme Court said that the appeal trial should go on
 8 janvari 2018 ko pitiai par khabar aati he ki apil kii adaalat ne donon hi aropiyon ko bari kar diya he
 That is, those who were accused of paying bribe were acquitted
 italy kii adaalat ke anusaar oresi or bruno ne rishwat hi nahin di
 The question before Italy was whether the CEO of his company here bribed him to get the deal
 vahaan yah sawaal khaarij ho gaya ki inhone rishwat nahin di
 The same people are also accused in India
 italy se jab yah vivaad bharat pahunchaa tab manmohan singh sarkaar ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh de die
 People related to his government were also accused but no leader or former minister is named in the charge sheet
 sibiai ne bhartiya vayusena ke purv senadhyaksh es pi tyaagi ko giraftaar kiya tha jo khud ko nirdosh bataate hai
 The latest news in the case of SP Tyagi is that he got the bail on September 12
 special jaj arvind kumaar ne 24 july ko tyaagi sahit agusta westland ke siio or finamekanika ke nideshak ji oresi ko saman kiya tha
 Tyagi appeared and got bail but the former CEO and President of agustawestland and Finmeccanica did not come
 ek bhi videshi naagarik court ke saamne haazir nahin hua
 While the court took cognizance of the charge sheet, it was believed that there is enough evidence of bribe eating
 kai baar purana maamla jab dobaaraa public spes main aata he to kuch yaad nahin rahata he
 If you will search the old news printed in such cases, then you will know who is serious about the investigation in this case

 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has written in his blog that Rafale fighter aircraft have been purchased at 9 percent lower price during NDA time than UPA
 jab pratishat main daam bataa sakate hai to puraa hi bataa dene main kya mushkil he
 So, did the agencies give this news to Indian journalists with any other intention so that the attention is diverted
 twitor par kai patrkaar likh bhi rahe the ki yah maamla is liye saamne laayaa gaya he taaki rafel vivaad ko lekar iz ikval tu ho sake
 Then on Wednesday afternoon our colleague Sunetra Chaudhary broke a news that Michelle had gone missing

 Hashke was also arrested
 italy main finamekanika ke purv president ji oresi or agusta westland ke purv siio bruno spganolini bhi giraftaar hue

 According to the Italian court, Orsi and Bruno did not bribe
 italy ke saamne sawaal tha ki kya unke yahaan kii company ke siio ne yah sauda hasil karne ke liye rishwat di
 There the question was rejected that he did not pay bribe

 When this dispute reached India from Italy, the Manmohan Singh government ordered a CBI inquiry
 unki sarkaar se sambandhit logon par bhi aarope laga magar chargeshit main kisi netaa yaa purv mantri kaa naam nahin he

 Not a single foreign citizen appeared before the court
 jabaki adaalat ne chargeshit kaa sangyaan lete hue mana tha ki rishwat khaane ke paryaapt saboot hai
 Sometimes when the old case comes again in the public space, nothing is remembered
 agar aap aise maamalon main chhapi puraani khabaron ko khangaalenge to pataa chalegaa ki is maamle main jaanch ko lekar koun kitna gambhir he
 Now come to the Rafale deal
 congress rafaal ladaaku vimaan saude ko lekar sanyukt sansadeey samiti se jaanch karaane kii maang kar rahi he
 Today, Congress leaders marched to the Delhi-based (CAG) office on this demand

 This march included Ahmed Patel, Randeep Surjewala, Ghulam Nabin Azad, Vivek Tankha, Rajiv Shukla

 Seeing these two photos of Donna Docherty, who lives in Glasgow, Scotland, it is hard to believe that both photos have the same person
 ek tasviir unki shaadi ke vakt kii he or duusari tasviir shaadi ke kuch saalon ke baad kii
 Donna used to drink 6 can soft drinks a day before marriage
 jamkar junk food khaaya karti thi
 As a result, their weight kept increasing and crossed 90 kg
 donna bataati hai ki ties main unhen junk food, chips or cold drink ke alaava kuch bhi acha hi nahin lagata tha
 She used to drink 6 can cold drinks a day and as a result her weight reached 90 kg
 wo bataati hai ki jab dopaher main unhen bhukh lagati thi to wo doston ke saath chips shop par pahunch jaati thim or pet bharkar chips, kukies, biscuit or junk food khaaya karti thim
 She used to eat ready meal to satisfy hunger
 donna kahati hai ki chips or kukies khaanaa meri aadat ban chuki thi
 My need to drink cold drink
 wo bataati hai ki ye sab khaane-pine ke dauraan unke dimag main ek pal ko bhi ye khyaal nahin aayaa ki ye sehat se khilwaad he
 When Donna got married, she weighed 90 kg
 shaadi kaa goun unke tyrs ko or ubhaar rahaa tha
 This can be uncomfortable for any bride
 shaadi ke kuch saal baad donna maa baniin or bachche kii maujuudagi ne unke aas-paas sugar coted chizon kii bharmaar kar di
 Then one day he got a picture of his sister's wedding
 jisamen wo dulhan ke saath khadi thim or khubasurat najar a rahi thim
 At the same time, he decided to lose weight
 iske baad unhone sabase pehle gym janaa shuru kiya
 He did not think of any surgery and treatment
 sirfsugar coted chizon or cold drink se duribana lee
 Started cooking and eating at home
 healdi brakefast lenaa shuru kiya or kuch hi maheenon main fark najar aane laga
 In such a situation, if you are also addicted to cold drinks and chips or you also resort to ready-to-eat diet for fear of cooking, then think again
 kahin aapaki haalat bhi donna kii tarah na ho jaae

 The only source of water there is a stream coming from the mountain from where women bring water
 lekin vah pine ke liye surakshit nahin he
 They have been pleading with the authorities to provide a safe water source for a long time, but they are not being heard

 The authorities wrote their complaints and also inspected the Anganwadis, schools and health centers

 It also includes the area of south Kashmir which is severely affected by terrorism and has remained inaccessible to leaders since the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in 2016

 Officials say this is a strategic effort to meet rural needs
 isamen gram sabha or graminon ke saath baatcheet shaamil he
 In it, a letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi is read, in which issues like healthcare, education, livelihood etc
 are discussed
 adhikariyon ne graminon ko dirghakaalik uddeshyon ko praapt karne ke liye teen sadasyeey audit panel banane ko kaha he
 However, a 32-year-old man in Shopian says that he is watching it carefully and hopes that the effort does not become a mere photographing event

 —miijjam mohammad During the discussion at the 'dream house' session at Delhi Aaj Tak Entrepreneur Summit, Prem Mohan Singh of Bullem Reality and Santhosh Kumar Mishra, MD of Sunfrank Group told that the real estate sector is on the path of progress with a very positive sentiment
 agle paanch saal main bahut si chijen badalane vaali hai
 The way the housing sector is booming, it can contribute up to 13 percent of the country's GDP by 2025
 sarkaar ko bhi chahie ki ise industry kaa darja de
 Till now we get loan at 13
5% interest
 industry kaa darja milane par bainkon se sahuuliyat mil sakegi
 When the economy was in crisis, Santosh Mishra of Sun Fran Group rejected the question of the auto sector's struggles
 unhone kaha ki houseing sector main negative centement nahin he
 It is moving forward with the positive sentiment
 yah desh kii arthvyavastha ke liye sakaaratmak sandesh he
 Builders said that the way the Modi government has framed policies, the real estate sector has shifted its focus from luxury to affordable houses
 jhaansi se lekar dubai tak main project shuru karne vaale sanfrain group ke santosh mishra ne kaha ki ham aise builder hai, jo sapane todate nahin balki jodate hai
 Complete the project on time and give possession
 prem mohan singh ne bataaya ki unhone chaar saal pehle 20 se 25 logon ke saath milakar bahut chunauteepurn samay main company kholi thi
 At that time it was felt that there is a lack of professionalism in the real estate sector
 builder or boir ke bich rishte main bharose kaa sankat tha
 In Ace, we worked on connecting these links through a real estate company
 kyon tuutata he logon kaa bharosadilli-ensiaar main bilderon se judin tamaam shikaayatein aati hai
 Even after giving money, many people are not able to find homes
 builder samay se project puraa nahin karte hai
 On this, Santosh Mishra said that not every money builder can be made
 kisi bhi real estate group ko chalaane ke liye anubhav hona chahie
 Earlier, people used to easily take 50 and 100 crores worth of land on the basis of money
 magar takneekee rup se majboot na hone ke kaaran ve tay samay main project puraa nahin kar pate the
 There are a variety of reasons behind the credibility crunch
 rera se builder or boyrs donon ko labhshantosh kumaar mishra or bulam reality ke prem mohan singh ne kaha ki sarkaar kii ore se rera kanoon aane ke baad bilders or boyrs donon ko phayda hua he
 Rera is a boon for homebuyers
 aam aadmi jab makaan lene kii taiyaari karata he to use yah jaanchana aasaan ho gaya he ki koun si cheez investment ke liye thik he
 By visiting rera's site, you will be able to check the credibility of the builder from the project
 yahi nahin bilders kii rekking bhi ab rera ke tahat hoti he
 In this, the builders who complete the project in the given time, even if their turnover is low, can still achieve good ranking
 bilders ke liye laabh yah he ki agar koi teen kishtein nahin jamaa karata to uskaa daawa radd kar duusare ko bech dene kaa adhikaar miltaa he

 Both these things have become glamor in Bollywood and cricket, India
 agar ye donon chijen ek saath mil jaati hai tab to wo khabar apane aap main behad khaas ho jaati he
 You must have seen many times that Bollywood stars are seen showing interest in cricket

 During the match, the Nawab gets hurt and starts bleeding from the nose
 magar iske baavjood bhi ve khelte rahete hai or khub chauke-chakke lagaate hai
 Sharmila sitting in the pavilion's heart falls on the Nawab Saheb and then both get married
 jabaki asli kissa ye he ki mansoor ali khan pataudi ne sharmila ko paris main prapoj kiya tha
 The two first met in Delhi in 1965
 kaha jaataa he ki pehali hi najar main nawab sahab ko sharmila bha gai thim
 But winning Sharmila's heart was not so easy
 iske liye pataudi ko kaaphi mashkkat kerani padi
 After a long wait of 4 years, Pataudi proposed to Sharmila
 magar raah abhi bhi aasaan na thi
 Due to separation of religion, both had to work hard to convince their family members
 sharmila ko shaadi se pehle dharm parivartan karnaa padaa or ve aaysha sultanaa ban gayi
 In 1969, both of them got married with great pomp and show
 is shaadi se unhen teen bachche hue

 It is being said that through this visit, the BJP government wants to get an overview of the reconstruction work going on in Kedarnath
