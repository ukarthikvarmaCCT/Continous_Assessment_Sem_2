 aane vaali film 'het story 2' ke trailor se lagata he ki pehali film 'het story' kii tarah hi yah bhi kaamuk film hogi
 But actor Jai Bhanushali, who is playing the lead role in the film, argues to the contrary
 unhone kaha ki kaamuk drishy film ke sirf ek gane main hi filmaae gaye hai
 Jai told in an interview, 'clearly,' Hate Story 2 'is not like the first film
 vah ek kaamuk film thi, lekin yah ek rahasy romaanch he
 Some are intimate scenes in just one song
 jabaki puri film ek kahani par chalati he
 'jai said,' There are 10 good things in the film and the last thing is the intimate scene
 baaki nau chijen bhi hai, jo aap 18 july ko film pradarshit hone ke baad dekhenge

 a few months ago, the Delhi government had said that soon free wi-fi facility will be provided in many places in Delhi, but even after the completion of two years of government, the people of Delhi are waiting for this facility
 apni badhati ahmiyat kaa media ke liye isse behatar sakshya nahin ho saktaa ki jis hafte nayaa bajet aayaa, sansad main ek jeevant bahes hui, kashmir main pidipi-bijepi kii aitihaasik sarkaar bani, cricket kaa vishwa cap chal rahaa tha or yahaan tak ki benjamin netanyahu ne washington ko hilaa daalaa, media kii adhiktar surkhiyon main ham patrkaar hi bane rahe
 The trend began with Prashant Bhushan, who filed a public interest litigation in Essar with some internal e-mails to the Supreme Court, indicating there were benefits
 iske baad ek patrkaar ne udghaatan kiya ki aam aadmi party ne apni andruni kalah ko nibatane ke liye uske saath hui baatcheet ko tepe kiya he
 Finally, a documentary on Nirbhaya's rapists created a rage within the media, when one section of the media was gang-raped and confronted the other
 ye ghatnaayen aise sawaal khadey kar rahi hai jo bharat main na sirf patrakarita ke bhavishya ke lihaaj se ahm hai balki vyapak str par aaazaad abhivyakti, khabaron tathaa vichaaron kii padtaal or prabandhan ke sandarbh main bhi jaruri hai, kyonki aajkal ‘newstrading’, ‘ped media’ or sampadakeey madhyasthata jaise ajeebogareeb shabd aamayaham hai
 i am touching the weak vein by talking on this issue
 yah barudi surang par chalane jaisaa he
 Now-a-days i am not connected to any institute full time, so with a sense of neutrality i feel that i should talk about this subject
 aaie, bhushan ke essar se jude udghaatano se shuru karte hai jisamen hamen do tathy najar aate hai: pehla, nitin gadakari apane parivaar ke saath chhuttiyon par company ke jahaaj se france ke pashchim main saiyr karne gaye the; doosraa, alag-alag samachar sansthaanon ke kuch patrakaron ne shower vaali gaadi se lekar company ke guestaouse vagairah kaa chhitput laabh ek se das din tak uthaaya
 This matter could not last much because Bhushan remained in the news for some other reasons
 iske thanda padane tak hamane paaya ki gadakari or essar ke maalik ruia to chaiyn se baithe hue the lekin teen patrakaron kii naukari chali gai jinamein do ab bhi reporter hi the
 They protested their treatment, saying that they were not involved in any serious crime and that the work for which they have been made the sacrificial goat is no more a matter of crossing the red light
 pehle to hamen is baat ko samaj lene kii jarurat he ki koi bhi patrkaar chaahe kitna hi bada kyon na ho, vah apni story korporate sambandhit kisi se yaa phir kisi or se bhi koi laabh letaa he to yah lalabatti paar kar jane se zyada gambhir aparaadh he
 Freebies are a crime and fatal to our profession
 aaj satta pratishthan, sarkaar, korporate, or yahaan tak ki acha anudaan paane vaale enjio bhi ham patrakaron ke bare main aakhir kya sochate hai? unhen lagata he ki hamaara ahan itnaa bada he ki hamen daraana aasaan nahin or agar hamen hadakaayaa gaya to ham ikatthe hokar palatwaar kar denge, lekin hamaari pagaar itani kam he or chhavi itani maamuli ki ve agar hamen kharid nahin sakate to bhaade par to rakh hi sakate hai
 Vicious people associated with public relations are always in the eyes of our weak moments: for example, the child or the parents are ill, have to enroll in school or college, travel abroad or have a case of education
 ek patrkaar ke liye in chizon se nibatane ke liye pakke iraade, satarkta or kaushal anivaary he
 If you failed this exam then you should not expect sympathy
 iske baavjood kuch or masale rekhaankit kiye jane yogya hai
 First talk of Gadkari
 ve yah daleel dekar chaiyn se baith gaye hai ki yah tab kii baat he jab ve na to locasevak the, na saansad or na hi bijepi ke adhyaksh
 Also they are old friends and neighbors of the Ruia family, so what has happened
 unki is daleel se kahani kii to hawa nikal gai lekin ve teen patrkaar? prashanth bhushan kii yachika ko dhyaan se dekhie

 Note that in PIL, there is only one mention of a leader who has a legal argument in his defense that he was not a public servant at that time
 isamen naukarshah ek bhi nahin he
 Then, there are three journalists who are most important to us: PIL requests that the media's engagement with the corporate world be met
 yah media par nyaayik bandish ko ek nyotaa he or sabase zyada chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki ham patrakaron ne is pahalu kii upeksha kii he, bajaae iske ek hitadhari paksh kii tarah apni safai dene main jute hue hai
 In the last 15 years, the way Indian journalism has grown in terms of its stature, strength and salary and allowances, some bad things have also come to its consciousness
 isiilie jab bhi patrakaron ko lekar koi ghapala saamne aata he to iske bade chehre bhi yah kahkar khud ko bachaa lete hai ki ‘‘bhaad main jaae, kam se kam maine to aisa nahin kiya, baaki sab chor hai
 "in this way, the whole profession becomes tainted and the abusers of us roam freely
" is chalan kii shuruyaat radia tepe cond se hui thi jisamen paanch patrkaar alag-alag staron par dhatakarmon main lipt paae gaye the
 We were all so scared that we could not even say that these are just five of the hundreds of journalists whom Radia would have talked to
 isi kaa nateeja he ki aaj hamaare sabase kaamyaab, andolankaaree or aaazaad aawaaj ke himachati vakil supreme court jaakar media par adalati bandish lagane kii guhaar kar rahe hai
 Any such news related to Essar would be huge
 yah radia tepe ke baad hamen laga doosraa dhakka he
 However, there is no evidence to gain anything in return, nor has there been any serious investigation into the work of these journalists that proves that they have made compromises
 sampadak kaa darja ooncha hota he isliye use usee par lagu maanak ke aadhaar par jaancha janaa chahie
 But allowing a few reporters to taint their profession due to the slight and stupid arbitrariness is not just a punishment for themselves, but also the cowardice of the media's leading faces
 main jaanata hum ki aisa kehane ke apane khatre hai lekin immergency ke baad or sudhaaron ke daur main hamaare jaise patrakaron ko patrakarita se jo kuch hasil hua he, uskaa shrey hamaare sahyogi patrakaron ko hi jaataa he or hamen unke liye khadaa hona chahie
 If a journalist is actually caught taking advantage of or influencing someone, then the fault is also with the owners and editors
 haal ke varshon main jis tarah media kaa vistaar hua he or yah alag-alag dishaao main badha he, ek peshewar sampadak kaa kad kaaphi kam hota gaya he
 In linguistic journalism, most editors are the owners themselves, so both their original business and news are as cluttered as the wires in our small towns are intertwined
 peshewar sampadak aaj bhi bache hue hai lekin malikan / prabandhan kii chahat hoti he ki sampadak apana aadmi ho na ki koi aisa shaks jo bahari duniya se judaa ho yaa jiskaa naam ho
 Even in our largest media institute, if the editor wants to write on his own byline then it is an unpleasant thing
 yahi vajah he ki 21veen sadi kii pasand aise sampadak hai jo agyaat hon, chote kad ke hon or jinase koi khatra na ho
 All our mainstream English newspapers and four out of five national business newspapers either have owners themselves or do not write editors
 isse newsroom ke bheetar ek sharmnaak kism kaa vibhaajan dekhne main aata he jahaan sampadak to apane-apane banksron main kaid pade rahete hai jabaki bechaare reporter radiaon or ruiaon kii nirmam duniya main nihathe nibatane ko chhod die jate hai
 They are expected to bring the news while the editor does not have a way of ascertaining the veracity of those reports
 is tarah puraane kism ke newjarumon main jaanch or santulan jaisaa ahm pahalu ab nahin dekhne main aata
 These reporters are also given the task of bringing important guests for the company's events, which nowadays have become an important part of the media's revenue
 sanstha ke taur par media kii girti saakh yaa kahen agyaat sampadak kaa ubhaar malikan ko raahat detaa he jabaki reportron ko nigahabaani se maharoom kar detaa he
 In such a situation, when a reporter gets caught by mistake, he is left alone to face the punishment
 ek sutara ke saath kisi patrkaar kaa rishta ek najuk or maheen kala kii tarah he jise seekhney main vakt lagata he
 a lobbyist or broker also has formulas, but the journalist has to win the trust of that formula and also gain respect with the strength of his honesty, secrecy and intelligence
 agar sampadak alag-thalag or duniya se kataa hua rahegaa to uskaa reporter khabaren li karne, plant karne or yahaan tak ki farji khabaren lagane kii chorgali main funs jayega
 The reporter has always been a pawn, but today it has become a tool for editors and proprietors to reach high places, invite guests and find sponsors for events
 kahin-kahin rajya sarkaron se jameen dilwane or vyapaarik saude karwaane kaa kaam bhi use karnaa padataa he
 In this process, the dividing line of ethics and business is erased, and so-called whistleblowers occasionally get internal papers
 iske baad to hamalavar girohon ke sakriy hone kii baari rahati he
 All this is happening at a time when formula based journalism becomes a crime and snatching up files becomes an art; When the reporter who developed his sources started being called a broker, while sitting on Google and social media, a man of ruthless adultery who considers listening to journalism as a watchdog; So this is the death of journalism
 us patrakarita kii maut, jiskaa kaam hi baahar nikalakar logon se milanaa or is gandali duniya ke bich main jaakar badi khabar ke saath vahaan se bedaag waapas aana hota he
 The crisis in our newsroom is more widespread than freebies
 yah sankat netritv or sidghanton kaa he
 i know that a newsroom is a very busy place
 phir bhi vah paak jagah he
 There is no more culinary thread in our profession than the trust between the reporter and his sutra, which we are often seeing nowadays falling apart

 Star spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have been rested which could give Rasool and veteran Amit Mishra a chance
 mishra vanade team kaa hissaa the lekin unhen koi match khilne kaa mauka nahin mila
 Among the players who are yet to confirm their place in the team, the most attention is drawn by 19-year-old Rishabh Pant
 unhone gharelu satr main shandaar pradarshan ke dam par pehali baar rashtriya team main jagah banaai he
 The Delhi wicket-keeper batsman performed brilliantly in the Under-19 World Cup last year and since then his career graph has been steadily rising

 He cannot be ignored given Pant's recent form
 mandeep england ke khilaaf pehle abhyaas match main kuch khaas nahin kar sake the jabaki pant ne duusare practice match main 36 gendon par 59 ran kii pari kheli thi

 raina par isliye bhi dabaav he kyonki kedaar jadhav jaise khilaadi lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Jadhav batted well in the ODI series and was adjudged Man of the Series
 yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki kohli kis tarah ke gendbaaji akraman ke saath utarana chahenge
 All-rounder Hardik Pandya made his impact in the ODI series and his presence also creates balance in the team
 tej gendbaaji kaa jimmaa jasprit bumraah, bhubaneshwar kumaar or umradraj nehra par rahegaa jinhone pichley saal ipel ke baad bade manch par cricket nahin kheli he
 Nehra underwent a knee operation after this
 spinners ke pradarshan par rahegi najrabharat ko spin vibhaag main soch samajhakar chayan karnaa hoga
 It has to be seen whether Kohli shows confidence in improvisational spinners or takes two specialist spinners
 unke paas mishra or chahal ke rup main leg spin ke do achche vikalp hai jabaki rasul team main shaamil ekmaatr of spinner hai
 4 pm 30 baje shuru hoga machos se bachane ke liye match shaam 4 bajkar 30 minute par shuru hoga or ummid kii ja rahi he ki vanade siries kii tarah isamen bhi ranon kaa ambara lagegaa

 It is the foresight of the Australian selection committee that he has presented Smith as an alternative to Clarke keeping the future in mind
 pehle yah mana ja rahaa tha ki team ke maujuuda wicketiper ballebaaz or up-captain bread hadine ko team kaa nayaa captain banaaya jayega, lekin australian chayan samiti ke pramukh rod marsh ne bataaya he ki chayansmiti ne lambey samay ke liye captaini ke daayitv ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yuva smith ko captain banane kaa faisla liya he
 According to Rod Marsh, the way Brad Haddin was acting as Michael Clarke's deputy, he would continue to support Steven Smith
 duusari ore, australian chayansmiti ke faisle se khud steven smith bhi hairaan rah gaye hai
 He had an idea that the team management would make Brad Haddin the captain
 lekin jab unke paas captaini ke liye rod marsh kaa phone aayaa, to unhen yakeen hi nahin hua
 However, Smith later said that, his dream of captaincy is being fulfilled and he is thrilled to think that
 darasal, steven smith ke liye beete 18 maheene behad kamyaabi bhare rahe hai
 He has scored five centuries in 12 Test matches during this period
 ballebaaji se kamaal dikhaane kii vajah se captaini par unka daawa majboot hua
 So far, Smith has played 23 Test matches for Australia and has scored 1749 runs at an average of around 46
 mahaj 25 saal kii umr main smith australia ke captain ban rahe hai
 Steven Smith is Australia's third youngest captain
 unase pehle 24 saal kii umr main kim hus or ian craig captain ban chuke hai, lekin bharat ke khilaaf siries ke dauraan vah apni team ke sabase yuva khilaadi hai or unhen apane seniyaron ko saath lekar chalanaa hoga
 Steven Smith is not worried about this challenge
 unke mutabik, unhen apane seniyaron kaa 100 fisadi sahyog miltaa rahegaa
 Steven Smith has assured that his team will perform aggressively throughout the series
 unhone australian media se baatcheet main kaha he ki captain ke taur par maidan ke andar vah khud behatar pradarshan karenge taaki vah apni team ko front se lead kar saken

 These rumors were bolstered by Venkanna's recent meeting with YSRCP leader Vijay Sai Reddy
 nani ne kaha ki emelsi, reddy ko dandavat karne ko taiyaar hai
 The Central Government has approved the long-standing demand of Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit to divide the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) into three parts
 is vibhaajan ko agle varsh hone vaale nigam chunaavon se thik pehle manjuuri mili he
 The goal of dividing the bjp-led MCD into three parts is to provide better civic services and streamline its functioning

 But i am also a little worried about what is in the future womb
 ’’ unhone kaha ki logon ko aisa nahan sochna chahie ki kuch hi maheenon main chijen bilkul badal jaaengi
 The Central Government has also approved the proposal to increase the reservation from 33 percent to 50 percent in the civic elections
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki rajya chunaav ayog agle saal april main hone vaale chunaavon ke liye farvari ke aarambh main adhisuchana jari kar sakati he
 This is the reason why the corporation has to complete the process of dividing it into three parts
 chhattisgarh rajya kii bemetara vidhansabha seat par pichley chunaav ko chhod den to congress hi jeet darj karti ai he
 In the 2013 assembly elections, Avdhesh Singh Chandel of Bharatiya Janata Party won here
 pichley teen chunaavon ko dekhen to har baar bhartiya janata party or congress ke bich hi muqabla dekhne ko mila he
 However, the way this time Ajit Jogi and Mayawati's alliance with the BSP has to be seen, what will be the effect
 kyonki is kshetra main essi voter adhik maatra main hai, jo sidhe taur par chunavi nateezon par fark daal sakate hai

 The 2013 assembly election results were announced on 8 December
 inamen bhartiya janata party ne rajya main lagaataar teesri baar congress ko maat dekar sarkaar banaai thi
 a total of 49 assembly seats were won by BJP in 2013 led by Raman Singh
 jabaki congress sirf 39 siten hi jeet pai thi
 While 2 seats went to others
 2008 ke mukaable bijepi ko teen siten kam mili thim, iske baavjood unhone purna bahumat se apni sarkaar banaai
 Raman Singh is the Chief Minister of the state since 2003
 16 janvari ko 5 rajya sabha siton par chunaav hone vaale hai
 But everyone's eyes are on the capital Delhi, where Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party will get 3 mps in Rajya Sabha
 dilli kaa rajya sabha kaa dangal dilachasp hone vaala he
 So far, the Aam Aadmi Party has not announced the name of any candidate, but the ambition of the leaders of the party has started appearing on the streets from social media
 mahatvakankshaon ke is jang kii ek tasviir guuruuvaar ko dekhne ko mili jab party ke tisare kaddavar netaa or kavikumar vishwaas ke samarthakabora bistara or tent lekar aam aadmi party ke daftar main hi deraa daalane pahunch gaye
 With the placards in hand, the supporters of the faith were demanding the party high command to send Kumar Vishwas to the Rajya Sabha
 vishwaas hi nahin aam aadmi party main kai aise netaa hai jo dilli kii in teen rajyasabha siton par nazren gadaaye kejariwal ke faisle kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 On the one hand the party leaders are waiting for their wishes to be fulfilled, while on the other hand, the party is discussing outgoing faces of the party for the three Rajya Sabha seats of Delhi
 aam aadmi party main maujuud sutron ne aaj tak ko pehle hi bataaya tha ki party dilli kii in teen rajyasabha siton ke liye party se baahar ke chehron par vichaar kar rahi he
 Therefore, if there is no conflict between the leaders, Kejriwal wants to send veteran leaders working in different areas of the country to the Rajya Sabha
 isse ek taraf party ke andar ladaai jhagade se bachaa ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, by sending experts to the Rajya Sabha, the Aam Aadmi Party wanted to demonstrate its seriousness and activism on national issues at the national level
 party chaahati he ki rajyasabha main unki siton par wo chehre jaaen jo modi sarkaar ko har morche par na sirf gher saken balki sadan main sarkaar se sawaal jawaab kar saken
 Kejriwal also wants Delhi to dominate the issue of full state and constitutional rights in the Rajya Sabha
 ajtak ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik party ke aalaa netaaon ke bich philhal manthan abhi bhi isi baat par jari he ki sansad ke upree sadan main party ke andar ke netaaon ko bheja jaae yaa baahar se kisi ko
 The first name that the Aam Aadmi Party has discussed for the Rajya Sabha so far was former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajanaka, which was rejected by Raghuram Rajan
 rajan ke baad party ne jin naamon par vichaar karnaa shuru kiya or jis par manthan abhi bhi jari he unamem pehla naam he supreme court ke jane maane vakil or sanvaidhanik maamalon ke jaankaar gopal subramanyam kaa
 Gopal Subramaniam has been consistently giving legal advice to the Kejriwal government on the Delhi Government vs Lieutenant Governor issue
 saath hi adaalat main dilli sarkaar kii ore se pairvi bhi karte rahe hai
 The other name that comes up for discussion for Rajya Sabha seats will surprise you
 kejariwal and company bijepi ke baagi netaa, purv saansad or purv vitt mantri yashavanth sinha ke naam par charchaa kar rahi he
 The third big name that came up for discussion in AAP is that of famous journalist and writer Arun Shourie who is considered a big critic of Modi government
 itnaa hi nahin aam aadmi party main rajyasabha kii siton ke liye bataur ummidavaar mashhoor udyogpati rahul bajaj ke naam par bhi charchaa ho rahi he
 Rahul Bajaj has been a supporter of Arvind Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party
 5 janvari ko rajyasabha siton ke liye hone vaale chunaav ke namakan kaa aakhri din he, lekin aam aadmi party ab tak kisi bhi naam par faisla nahin kar pai he
 There is also the news of the sources that there are differences in opinion among different leaders of different names in the party
 party main ek duusari sthiti he ki agar apane hi netaaon ko rajyasabha bhejnaa hua to vah chehre koun ho sakate hai
 Contrary to claims, Aam Aadmi Party leader and former banker Meera Sanyal is at the forefront of these faces
 vahiin baaki kii 2 siton ke liye sanjay singh or ashutosh sabase prabal daavedaar maane ja rahe hai
 There is no discussion on the name of Kumar Vishwas among the party leaders on social media and on the street
 vishwaas samarthakon ke daawey or ummid to hai lekin party ne ab tak unke naam par charchaa nahin kii he
 Party sources believe that the distance between Vishwas and Kejriwal and the growing distrust of Kumar in the party is the biggest obstacle in his way to Rajya Sabha
 sutron ke mutabik, aam aadmi party kii sarvocch ikai political afares cameti yani ki piesi somvaar yaa mangalvaar ko baithak karegi or jisamen aupchaarik tareeke se rajyasabha kii 3 siton ke liye ummidavaaron ke naam par muhar laga di jaaegi

 unhone kaha ki is bill ke mutabik 5-10 hajaar rupee kamaane vaale dalit kaa parivaar kamjor varg nahin he lekin 8 lakh rupee kamaane vaala kamjor varg he

 Many schemes have also started the work of removing Akhilesh Yadav's photographs from ration cards

 In fact, the style of the Yogi government, which barely completed two weeks, is clearly visible in UP

 All the old colors of power are being removed rapidly
 1
 The word socialist will be removed from all ambulances of the state government
 2
 Three crore ration cards with Akhilesh's photo will be withdrawn from the state
 3
 The Samajwadi Shravan Yatra to be run for the elderly will also be just a Shravan Yatra, farewell to the word socialist
 4
 The state nutrition mission led by Dimple Yadav has been dissolved
 ye yojana rajya kii kuposhit mahilaon or bacchon kii pahchaan ke liye chalaai ja rahi thi, jisaki aguwai dimple yadav kar rahi thi

 Lack of nutrients: Bread has much less nutrients than others
 khaastaur par white bread main
 Neither eating bread gives fiber, nor does grain get full benefit
 ek tareeke se koi bhi poshak tatv hamaare sharir main nahin jaataa he
 If you cannot give up the habit of bread, then start eating whole-grain bread instead of white bread
 ye tulanaatmak rup se behatar he
 2
 namak kii atyadhik matrajydaatar bread main bahut adhik maatra main namak hota he
 This affects the balance of sodium in the body
 aap chaahe to ghar par bread taiyaar kar sakate hai or usamen namak kii maatra ko santulit rakh sakate hai
 3
 vajan badhaata hedgar aap bread ke bahut shaukeen hai to aapkaa vajan badhanaa lagbhag tay he
 The salt, sugar and preservatives present in it are weight gain factors

 This is not a complete diet, if you have paid attention then you must have found that even after eating bread, hunger is not relaxed
 ye philler kii tarah kaam karata he lekin ise ek vakt ke aahaar ke rup main lenaa sahi nahin he
 Breakfast should be the most healthy anyway
 aise main aapke liye bread kaa vikalp talashna behad jaruri he

 Heena Fatima and Bahrain Noor - They were married to two brothers and now they have not found any documents related to divorce and hence it is against the law of Islam

 shanivaar subah bhi kiran bedi ne twit karke kaha ki agar ham bharat ko apane teen saal puri mehnat or patibaddhta se den, to agle do saal ke baad se vah hamaara nirmaan shuru kar degaa

 However, after answering this, he definitely said that he is not doing negative politics

 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed

 ) ghazipur landphil haadase ke baad east emsidi kii nazren ab uttar purvi dilli ke ghonda gurjan khadar kii us jameen par tik gai hai, jise didie ne nigam ko landphil site banane ke liye saunpa he, lekin nigam ko yahaan landphil site banane se pehle kai chunautiyon se nipatna he, jo itnaa aasaan nahi dikhataa
 Let us tell you that the DDA has handed over 150 acres of land in Ghonda Gurjan Khadar to the East MCD, but its proximity to the Yamuna river is dangerous for the environment, while the people living nearby have started objecting to it from now on
 Have given
 ajtak ne jab is prastaavit landphil site kii zamin kaa daura kiya to paaya ki yahaan kai aisi vajahen hai jo nigam ke saamne chunauti ban kar khadi hai
 The biggest challenge before the corporation will be to stop groundwater pollution here
 is jameen par barish ke kaaran kaaphi pani jamaa he jo dhire-dhire zamin main risataa he
 Now, if the landfill site is built here, its water will percolate and pollute the land here, which will directly affect the millions of people living in colonies located right in front of this site
 yamuna nadi se najdiki prastaavit landphil site banane kii disha main sabase bada roda sabit hogi
 This land comes in the Yamuna Flood Plain, which receives a lot of water during the Yamuna floods
 yadi yahaan landphil site bani to pehle se hi pradooshit yamuna ke liye khatra or bad jayega
 Near the proposed landfill site is the land of the Forest and Wildlife Department, where there are a large number of bamboo, berries, rosewood, arjun trees which are likely to end
 kudarti vajahon ke alaava yahaan ke rahane waalon ke paas prastaavit landphil site kaa virodh karne kii ek or vajah he or wo he cricket
 Yes, this land is also a big playground for thousands of youth living in this area, where they come to play cricket
 unka kahana he ki yadi yahaan landphil site bani to unka khel kaa maidan chhin jayega or inhen cricket khilne kai kilometre dur buraadi yaa mukherjee nagar janaa padegaa, kyonki uttar purvi dilli main itnaa bada khel kaa maidan or kahin nahi he
 Apart from all this, the local parliamentarian is also against the proposed landfill site and it is not a matter of contending against them, because these mps are the state president of the BJP which has the power in the corporation
 saansad manoj tiwari ke mutabik yamuna se unka gaharaa lagaav he or wo nahi chaahate ki yahaan landphil site bane
 According to Manoj Tiwari, because of the landfill site being built here, there will be filth in Yamuna, which no one would want
 unhone kaha ki wo nigam se baat kar ke yahaan prastaavit landphil site ko kisi or jagah le jane ko kahenge

 There is no doubt that in the last few years, they have emerged as inspiration for the youth

 Freedom for any country completely changes as soon as it is freed from the slavery of foreign power
 gulaami se nijaat ke baad''apni"sarkaron ko apane logon kii aazaadee main lagaataar badhotaree kerani hoti he
 The citizens' sense of responsibility towards the country depends on the reality of how their governments have decorated and decorated their freedoms
 bharat ke paas saamaajik,vaicharik or aarthik swadhinataon kii anokhi parampara rahi he upniveshwaad ne jise simit kiya tha taaki is gatiman desh par shashan kiya ja sake
 Now that every major political party or ideology has come into power, on the occasion of seventy years of independence, it is necessary to see what our princes have learned from the historical freedoms of Indian society and how much has it been enhanced or improved? India was one But not uniform
 britani,apane raaj ke liye is jatil desh ko peet-patkar ekarup karne kii koshish main lage rahe
 Even after independence, governments did not give up the insistence of uniformity (not unity)
 kisi ko yah vividhtaayen vikaas main baadhak lageen to kisi ko rashtrawaad main
 India is a museum of governance failures due to policies cut off and imposed from regional and local expectations
 1950se2010ke bich kareeb250se adhik se sarkari companiyaan baniin
 Half appeared during liberalization
 mughal or british raaj ke bich bhi apni swatantra udhyamita ko bachaakar rakhane vaala desh kabhi yah nahin samaj sakaa ki sarkarein aakhir kaarobaar kii puri aazaadee kyon nahin deteen
 Why does she want to continue doing business or is confident in giving business opportunities to some of her loved ones
 sarkaar ko bada karte jane kii sujh landan waalon kii viraasat thi
 He needed people who were helpful in governance
 pichley kuch dashakon main britain main naukarshahi choti hoti gai lekin bharat main sarkarein moti hoti gayi
 History shows that most of India (barring crises) had never looked to the king or power for a living
 lekin failati sarkarein apni mutthi bhar naukariyaan lekar aarakshan kii siyasat main utar gayi
 India was a source of income for Britain, so the taxation of production and consumption began in the late 19th century with taxes on salt and cloth
 beesvin sadi ke ant main sabhi utpaadanon par exise duty lag gai
 In the following decades, when Europe was reducing taxes to increase demand, consumption, production and employment, India was also taxing services
 badhati sarkaar ko paalane ke liye logon kii jindagi mahangaa karnaa jaruri ho gaya
 GST has continued this tradition with complete sanctity
 jitna tex ham chukaate hai yadi utani hi badi sarkaar hamen milane lage to pataa nahin to kya haal hoga
 When Prime Minister Narendra Modi was abolishing the old laws, he would have also looked at the British laws which were meant to curb freedom of expression
 'apni' sarkaron ne inhen sattar saalon me saheja or badhaayaa he
 The government is deeply unconcerned over its citizens' right to privacy
 sawaal poochhate log hukmaranon ko daraane lage to soochna kaa adhikaar tikaoo sabit nahin hua
 The British rulers knew that India is a historically powerful society, all the old narratives of this society give the message of limiting the power of kings
 taqatvar or swatantra samaaj se mukaable ke liye,bartaanvi shaskaon ne sattako akut shaktiyon se las kiya tha
 Governments that came after independence did not miss an opportunity to increase the power of power
 sarkarein failati chali gayi or sanvaidhanik sansthaaon ke bich takaraav bharat kaa sthaayee bhav ban gaya
 Freedom has to not only be saved but also increased
 america ne gulaami se mukti ke baad aazaadiyaan badhaane ke nae prayeg kiye jo duniya ke liye adarsh bane
 The rulers of India could have at least taken a lesson from their grand past if not America
 ronaald reagan kehete the sarkarein bhautikee ke kriya-pratikriya niyam kii tarah hoti hai
 The larger the government, the smaller the independence becomes
 pichley sattar saal main bharat main har sarkaar ne is niyam kii shuddhta main hamaara bharosa majboot kiya he

 Sukhbir Singh Badal, the deputy chief minister of Punjab and the youngest ever president of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), is extremely excited about the 2017 assembly elections
 10 saal se satta main rahane ke dabaav ke alaava esaidi ke saamne kuch sabase mushkil chunautiyaan hai—gathbandhan kii sahyogi bijepi ke badhate takaraavpurn ravaie se nibatna, arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party kaa teji se badhata prabhaav, jis vajah se purv cricket khilaadi navjot singh siddhu bhi usamen shaamil ho sakate hai, purv mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke netritv main congress kaa badhata jor, or yah dharna ki punjab patan kii ore ja rahaa he or iske yuva drugs kaa shikaar hokar barbaad hote ja rahe hai
 Badal, who created history in Punjab by coming to power for the second consecutive time in 2012 in a special conversation with group editorial director Raj Chengappa and deputy editor Asit Jolly, says he is not worried at all, and is hoping to play his 'magic' for the third time
 unase baatcheet ke pramukh anshaikya navjot singh siddhu ke aam aadmi party main jane kii sambhaavna se aapaki party ke liye khatra ho saktaa he?koi khatra nahin he
 The Akalis have always saved them
 unke sansadeey (chunaav) record par najar daaliye, ve sirf akali prabhaav vaali siton (vidhansabha kshetra) se jite hai
 The last time (2009) when he had fallen from a lead of one lakh votes to 4,000, he had lost from the city (amritsar) and won from Akali areas
 unhone khud ek intervyuu main sweekaar kiya tha ki ve akali dal kii vajah se jite the
 Now look at 'you'
 jinne camedian hege (saare kamedian) usamen ja rahe hai
 The crowd comes to them for entertainment
 chunavi ladaai laduya bilkul alag baat he
 People know who they are going to vote for
 unhone (siddhu ne) kya kaam kiye hai? jaraa record dekhie, unhone sansad main kitna samay guzaara he or apane audishnon ke liye kitna samay diya he
 If comedy matters, then all the chief ministers would have been comedians
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 'aap' kii safalataa ko aap kaise dekhte hai?vah sirf ek baar kaa karishma tha
 He could not even save his bail in the assembly by-election in Talwandi Sabo (bhatinda district) immediately after the Lok Sabha elections
 uske baad unhone koi bhi chunaav na ladgaye kaa faisla kar liya tha, isliye ab unka bulbula foot chukaa he
 Kejriwal is a very big dictator
 pehle ve anna hajaare ke naam par jite
 He immediately excluded those he considered a challenge to himself
 yahaan tak ki 'aap' ke log bhi kehete hai ki ve bahut bade taanashaah hai
 AAP is a one-man party only
 jaraa unke bayanon ko dekhieh unhone kaha ki ve raajnneeti main nahin aaenge, kabhi chunaav nahin ladenge, unhone apane bachche kii kasam khai ki 'aap' ko agar bahumat nahin mila to ve kisi kaa samarthan nahin lenge, na hi kisi ko samarthan denge, unke vidhayak kisi tarah kii suvidhaayen nahin lenge, or phir unhone unka vetan 50,000 ru
 Increased from Rs
 2 lakh to Rs
 kar diya, jo desh ke kisi bhi rajya se zyada he
 There is talk of presenting Kejriwal as the Chief Minister of Punjab
 ve pradhanmantri (narendra) modi ke khilaaf apni ladaai ke liye punjab kaa istemaal karnaa chaahate hai
 He is in a way the chairman of just one municipal committee in Delhi
 isliye ve ek aisa rajya chaahate hai, jahaan police par unka niyantran ho taaki ve piem modi ke khilaaf rojaanaa ladaai lard saken
 Then from here they want to move to other states
 unke liye punjab sirf ek jang kaa maidan he, unki manzil nahin
 Eventually they will ruin Punjab as states need to maintain friendly relations with the Center
 masalan, punjab kii arthvyavastha main krishi ridh kii haddi kii tarah he
 Government procurement of wheat and rice requires the support of the Government of India — for relaxation in regulations, for cash lending limits, if it rains and creates moisture
 agar (centre ke saath) hameshaa ladaai chalati rahegi to kisaanon main araajaktaa fail jaaegi
 This would be a very bad situation for a border state like Punjab
 or kejariwal kya karenge? ve dharne par baith jaaenge
 Kejriwal is actually a chaotic man from inside
 dekhie, unke saath koun log hai—kattarpanthi, aatankwaadi sanghathanon se jude log, jin logon ne khalistaan kii ghoshnaa kii, ve unke samarthak hai
 So you are saying that Kejriwal is getting along with the separatists? They want to get Sikh vote

 If you feel that having a physical relationship before marriage will deepen the love between you both, then let me tell you that this option to strengthen the relationship is not right from anywhere
 visheshgyon kii maane to kai maamalon main shaadi se pehle shaareerik sambandh bananaa nuksaandeh ho saktaa he
 There are many things that can happen to your relationship before marriage, which can bring your relationship to a painful turn
 agar kal ko rishta tut gaya to bhaawanaaon ke aahat hone ke alaava astidi (sexual transmitted dijis) kaa khatra bhi bad jaataa he
 On the other hand, girls have to face many problems when they are pregnant
 iske alaava ye 3 kaaran bhi pramanit karte hai ki shaadi se pehle sambandh bananaa shaareerik, maansik or bhaavnaatmak rup se sahi nahin he:1
 It may be a matter of character that in our country, physical relations before marriage are not seen with proper eyesight
 aise main samaaj is sambandh ko sweekaar nahin karata he
 As a result, both boys and girls face social challenges
 2
 It is also dangerous to have a relationship before a unwanted pregnancy because there is a possibility of pregnancy during this time
 ek ore jahaan samaajik taur par yah sweekaarya nahin he, vahiin ladkaa or ladki bhi aisi kisi sthiti ke liye taiyaar nahin hote hai
 In this case, this situation can become a problem for both
 3
 Take the feeling of remorse, if you have had a physical relationship with someone before marriage but if you are not able to marry that person, then this gilt will bother you throughout your life
 iske alaava aapako yah dar bhi bana rahegaa ki agar aapke partner ko is baat kaa pataa lag gaya to aapaki shaadishuda jindagi barbaad ho jaaegi

 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sternly said that such mischief would not be tolerated after the talk of changing the name of the Government Primary School to Adarsh islamia Primary School in Salempur area of deoria district and keeping the school closed on Friday
 pradesh main vidhyalay kisi jati yaa majahab ke rup main nahin rahenge
 Yogi said that primary schools will remain under the Basic Education Council
 primary skool kii jo pahchaan he vaise hi rahenge
 Schools will not be identified as a caste or religion
 is tarah kii kisi bhi harakat ko bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 Explain that the name of the school was changed to Islamia Primary School Nawalpur instead of Primary School in the building of Primary School located in Navalpur village of Salempur Tehsil of Deoria district
 itnaa hi nahin ravivaar ke bajaae shuukravaar ko vidhyalay band rahata he
 In a way, the government school was converted into a madrasa
 is baat ke saamne aate hi basic shiksha vibhaag main hadakamp much gaya tha
 District Magistrate of Deoria Sujit Kumar summoned an inquiry letter from the Basic Education Officer and ordered an inquiry into the matter
 iske baad jila basic shiksha adhikari santosh kumaar pandey ne jaanch main paaya ki kaagajon or register par skool kaa naam rajkeey praathmik vidhyalay he jabaki skool kaa board islamia praathmik vidhyalay ke taur par likhaa gaya he
 So far, 6 such schools have come up in Deoria district, which have separated themselves from the government rules and converted them to Islamia Primary School instead of Government Primary School
 itnaa hi nahin in sarkari skool ko puri tarah madrason kii tarj par chalaaya ja rahaa he, jahaan skulon kii deevaaron par majahabi naare or majahab ke bare main likhi baaten mili he
 The names of the children and the signatures of the teachers and studies in the school were all in Urdu
 basic shiksha adhikari santosh kumaar pandey ne bataaya ki jaanch main aise 6 vidhyalay paae gaye hai jinhone apane naam badale hai or chupchaap madrason ke tarj par chalaaya ja rahaa tha
 It is being investigated who has been with all this and since
 haalanki phir se praathmik skool main tabdeel kar diya he naam hataa die gaye hai or shuukravaar kii jagah ravivaar ko hi chuttee hogi
 He said that strict action will be taken against whoever has done this
 devaria janapad main chah islamia praathmik vidhyalay chalate he
 These include Islamia Primary School Nawalpur, Islamia Adarsh primary School Karamha, Islamia Primary School Samipatti, Islamia Primary School Pokharbhinda, Islamia Primary Jaitpura and Islamia Primary Haraiya
 skulon ke headmasteron ne hi yah bataaya ki vidhyalay shuukravaar ko band rahete hai
 The tradition of writing Islamiyya in the name of schools dates back to 1904, since these are schools
 tabhi se ye chalaa aa rahaa he
 Please tell that all these schools fall under the Basic Education Department
 yahaan sabhi teacher muslim varg se aate hai in skulon kaa naam badal kar islamia praathmik skool kar diya gaya he
 Here the teacher's attendance is also recorded in Urdu
 School is closed on Friday and is open on Sunday
 vidhyalay ke adhyapakon kaa kahana he ki yah kai saalon se chal rahaa he
 There is no government order for this, here 60 to 80 percent of the Muslim community's children study
 is kaaran yah vyavastha kar di gai he
 Actually the matter has been revealed by mid-day meal audit
 pradesh main har din sabhi skulon ko mid de mile main chaatro kii upasthiti ko sarkaar ko data bhejnaa padataa he lekin in skulon main har shuukravaar ko chaatro kii upasthiti shunya hoti
 While in these schools, mid-day meal was given on Sundays
 is audit main yah saamne aayaa ki kuch aise skool hai jo ravivaar ko chal rahe hai
 This raised the ears of the department
 iske baad pataa chalaa ki ek samudaay vishesh ke paramparaon ke hisaab se skool ko chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Although the teachers and teachers of the schools are saying that this has been done in view of the multiplicity of Muslim students in the schools, but since when this has been going on, no one knows the truth
 ab puraa maamla jaanch ke ghere main he
 In fact, the whole matter came to light when the Block Education Officer of Salempur noticed that at Midday Meal in Islamia Primary School, Nawalpur, the number of students was shown zero on Friday and the children were being given food in the register on Sunday
 islamia skool ke headmaster khurshid ahamed kehete hai -ham 2008 main aae hai, tab se aisa hi chal rahaa he
 While Bachiya Devi was there before us, this was also going on in his time
 yah vidhyalay 1904 se he or tabhi se parampara chali aa rahi he
 The pairing of Aamir Khan and Salman Khan is remembered for 'andaz Apna Apna'
 1994 main relies hui is film ne us daur main box offis par khaas pradarshan nahin kiya tha
 But this comedy film was transformed into a cult classic during a few years and even today many fans remember this film only for the chemistry of Salman and Aamir
 baharhaal, film kii tarah hi salmaan or aamir kii aisi hi ek ofscreen chemistry hai, jo bahut hi mjedaar he
 During an interview, when Aamir was asked that Salman once said that you do not pay auto money? Aamir then narrated an anecdote, "once i and Salman had drunk and we were roaming
 tab autowale ko maine paise nahin die the or aisa isliye hua tha kyonki main kabhi apane paas cash nahin rakhata hum
 "" i always ask for money from Kiran or i have a manager who has cash, then i ask for money from him if needed
 lekin main apane paas cash nahin rakhata hum
 If no one was there that day, Salman had to pay money in my place

 After the inter topper scam was exposed, it was discussed not only in Bihar but nationwide
 vahi baccha raay jisane bihar main puure shiksha vyavastha kii jad ko hi khokhla kar diya
 Bachchan Rai is in the news once again after the inter topper scam
 baccha raay par bihar ke adhikari kitne meharbaan the iskaa khulaasa aaj tak ko mili ek dastavej se hua
 You will be surprised to know that the Bachcha Raike fake degree college was given a clean chit by the monitoring department of Bihar
 jis vakt baccha raay ke farji degree college ko maanak ke anuroop paakar clin chit di gai, us vakt nigaraanee ke pramukh the pike thakur jo is vakt bihar ke dijipi hai
 This is the case of 2012
 mujffarpur ke nigaraanee court main farji degree collejon kii jaanch ke liye maamla darj kiya gaya
 The then SP Parvez Akhtar was entrusted with the investigation
 saal 2013 main report aayi
 The Monitoring Department in its report gave clean chit to all four colleges of Bacha Rai, while firs were lodged on the remaining colleges
 nigaraanee ke is report par sawaal uthne lage hai
 The reason is that the reality on the ground of four colleges of Bacha Rai is something else whereas these colleges were found to be in the report
 is maamle main mujffapur ke nigaraanee court main shikaayat darj karaane vaale vakil sudhir ojha kaa kahana he ki unhone baccha raay ke kalege ko clin chit dene vaale nigaraanee ke espi parvej akhtar kii shikaayat pike thakur se kii thi lekin koi karrwai nahi hui
 Four Colleges of Bacha Rai Rajdev Rai Degree College, Kiratpur, Rajaram Bhagwanpur, Vaishali, Rajdev Rai Lalmuni Degree College, Facekala, Vaishali, Siyavati Lalmuni Devi Degree College Patepur, Vaishali and Thakur Devi Ramchandra Rajdev Bouaji Rai Degree College, Sathiota, Lalganj, Vaishali The Monitoring Department was given a clean chit by keeping the rules and regulations under control
 sabase pehle aapako rajdev raay lalamuni degree college cheharakala kii hakeekat bataate hai
 It is written on the board that 31 subjects are taught in this college, but the truth is that this college does not yet have its own building
 is college ke bhawan kii abhi chat kii hi dhalaai ho rahi he
 In the investigation, the Department of Polarisation of the open college has written in its report that this college has a total of 15 rooms for the principal room, laboratory, library, class room, while the truth is different
 hakeekat ye he ki abhi tak is college kaa bhawan hi ban rahaa he
 The Monitoring Department had also written in its report that this college has several acres of land, whereas recently when Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University got its inquiry done, no documents of the name of the land were found with the university
 yahi haal baccha raay ke duusare degree college siyavati lalamuni degree college patepur, vaishali kaa he
 In the report of this college too, the surveillance department created a lot of tricks
 report main zikr kiya gaya ki college ke paas susajjit pustkaalay, class rum, prayogshaala, karyaalay or praachaarya ke kul 16 kamare hai jabaki hakeekat isse bilkul alag he
 When this college does not have this much room to date, nor is it all, which was mentioned in the report
 aise main saal 2013 main jab nigaraanee ne apni report di thi, to us vakt ye sab kahaan se hoga
 The college running in Khaprail's house now tells you the reality of Thakur Devi Ramchandra Rajdev Rajaji Bauaji Rai Degree College, Sathiota, the third college of Bacha Rai
 is college kii hakeekat ye he ki khapril ke makaan main kul chaar kamare hai jabaki report main likhaa gaya he ki is college main 6 class rum, 4 prayogshaala, ek praachaarya kaksh, ek karyaalay uplabdh hai
 The report also mentions that the construction work of the new building is also being done while there is nothing like it on the ground
 isi college se hui thi topper ghotaale kii shuruyatbachha raay ke chauthe degree college rajdev raay degree college ko bhi nigaraanee vibhaag ne clin chit di jabaki isi college se inter topper ghotaalaa kii shuruyaat hui thi
 In this way, the monitoring department came under the influence of Bacha Rai and gave a clean chit to its four degree colleges which do not meet the standards set for accreditation from anywhere
