 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has not received permission from the UP government to meet Chandra Shekhar Azad Ravan, the leader of the Bhim Army
 kejariwal ne yogi sarkaar se uttar pradesh se saharanpur kii jail main band chandrashekhar se milane kii ijaajat maangi thi, jo unhen nahin mil saki
 After this, Kejriwal took to Twitter to target the Yogi government
 unhone likhaa, 'daliton ke netaa ko upi kii bhaajapa sarkaar ne raajnneetik dwesh ke kaaran kaaphi samay se jail main rakhaa he
 i wanted to meet him but it is very unfortunate that the Yogi government did not allow me

 The local administration has claimed that there could be political discussion between Kikjeriwal and Chandrashekhar Azad and this could lead to deteriorating law and order and deteriorating atmosphere
 report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki jail manual ke mutabik ravan se unke parivaar kaa hi koi sadsy mil saktaa he
 It is feared that if Kejriwal makes a statement in the press after meeting him, which is likely, it will also violate the jail manual
 saharanpur prashasan ne police adheekshak se is bare main report lee he or kaha he ki 13 agast ko kejariwal ke saharanpur ke prastaavit daure ke samay dalit or rajputon main sangharsh ho saktaa he
 According to the Saharanpur DM, Kejriwal can make a statement after meeting Chandrasekhar, which could lead to deteriorating law and order
 aapako bataa den ki chandrashekhar ko pichley saal 2 november ko elahabaad hai court kii bench ne saharanpur jaateey hinsa se jude sabhi maamalon main jamaanat de di thi
 Chandrasekhar was made the main accused of this ethnic violence
 jail main band chandrashekhar ne jamaanat ke liye elahabaad hai court main arji di thi, jahaan se unhen raahat mili or sabhi cese main jamaanat mil gai
 But on getting bail, the difficulties of the Chief of Bhim Army increased
 bel milane ke baad hi unhen rasuka ke tahat niruddh kar liya gaya

 The Lokpal Bill, which had been a cause of trouble for the government from the beginning, has now become the name of trouble for it
 sarkaar ne loksabhaa main ye bill paas to karvaa liya
 But this bill did not get constitutional status
 jis kheme main din bhar mej par taaliyaan bajati raheen
 Why suddenly there was such a mourning silence? kyon ek elaan se piem se lekar sonia gandhi ke chehre tak par havaaiyaan udne lageen
 After all, the government made the Lokpal as it wished
 vipaksh kii baat nahin maani phir bhi lokapal paas ho gaya
 Despite this, the government lost
 din bhar lokapal par shabdhwaar hota rahaa
 The opposition continued to threaten the Lokpal bill
 sarkaar use nazarandaaj karti rahi
 After 10 pm
 jab din bhar kii bahes par sadan kaa mat jaanane kaa vakt aayaa to shuru ho gai siyaasi halchal
 Many parties left the House and the government got the Lokpal Bill passed in its own way with great ease
 lekin, raajnneeti kaa game to aakhri vakt main bhi palat jaataa he
 The same happened in Lok Sabha regarding Lokpal bill
 sarkaar lokapal ko sanvaidhanik darja dena chaahati thi
 This was Rahul Gandhi's dream
 iske liye samvidhan main sanshodhan kii jarurat thi
 According to the rule, the government was to achieve this with the approval of two-thirds of the members present in Parliament
 lekin sarkaar aisa nahin kar pai
 The government failed to get the Lokpal constitutional status
 loksabhaa ke sankhya-ganit main sarkaar ke pattey kam ho gaye or sarkaar kaa ye sabase ahm sanshodhan prastaav sadan main gir gaya
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was left saying that this happens in the system of Parliament
 lekin sadan ke netaa or vitt mantri pranab mukherjee apni khiz ko roak nahin paae
 Pranab Mukherjee said, 'we wanted a strong Lokpal Bill
 samvidhan ke tahat wo chale
 But this proposal could not be passed in Parliament due to the attitude of the opposition, especially the BJP
 ’jaahir he ab sawaal to uthne hi lage hai ki aakhir sarkaar ke saath aisa kaise ho gaya
 There are also pressures that when the government cannot pass an amendment in the house, then what is the use of it? iske baad vipaksh kaa shuru hua hamalaa or usne sarkaar se maanga istipha
 Obviously, the government is now in double trouble
 rajyasabha se bill ko paas karwaanaa or vipaksh ke jabardast hamale ko jhelana
 Till Tuesday, the question was what would happen to the Lokpal
 lekin, aaj sawaal ye ban gaya he ki kya hoga sarkaar kaa

 The Supreme Court, in its order, had said that the commission should submit the report in a sealed envelope by April 19 regarding the film
 lekin court main good friday kii chuttee hone ke kaaran nirvachan ayog modi byopic ko lekar apni silband report daakhil nahin kar paaya
 Now on Monday, April 22, the court will hear the matter
 piem modi par bani siries ke paanch episod stream ho chuke hai
 On releasing it during the election, the director says that it is a coincidence

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki kisi film kii 100 rupee yaa usase kam kii tikat par 18 pratishat tex padegaa
 Whereas in case of higher price, 28 percent tax has to be paid
 aise main distribyootors kaa maananaa he ki single theatre paranghshtha kaa asarmultiplex ke mukaable kam hoga
 What will return on the good day of single screen? Actually, a ticket rate of Rs 100 can be found on single screen at the moment
 aise main agar yahaan kii tikat ke daam GST lagane ke baad kam rahete hai to single screen sineta par film dekhne waalon kii bheed laut sakati he
 Anyway, many single screen theaters have closed in the last few days

 In such a situation, if there is more pocketing of the rate increases from GST, then the demand for piracy will be more

 do saal puraani bharat kii duusari aazaadee yani jiesti ko lekar agar aapako bhi aisa hi mahasoos hota he to ab desh ke sanvaidhanik auditor yani sieji ko apane dard se ittefaq karata hua paaenge
 The CAG has submitted the report card of the 'overall failure' of the GST to Parliament, which recalls recalling the midnight of June 30, 2017, when the epoch-making GST was revealed in the flamboyant Parliament House and the Central Hall adorned with the giants
 channel-channel ghumkar badhai gaate hue sarkaar ke mantri bataa rahe the ki jiesti ke avatar ke baad• kaarobaar karnaa duniya main sabase aasaan ho jayega• tex chor to dikhenge hi nahin• sarkaar kaa khajaana bhar jayega• desh kii vikaas dar main kam se do fisad kaa ijapha to tay samajhiegiasti par sieji kii taaja report 1991 ke baad bharat ke sabase bade aarthik sudhaar kii shradhanjali he
 What did the CAG get to explore the ease of doing business under GST? The auditor started by examining the registration system which is the gateway to the taxpayer's taxism
 pataa chalaa ki kai jaruri suchanaaen galat bhari ja rahi hai
 Even composition schemes (turnover based GST for small taxpayers) are being misused
 nirmaataa or saplir kii invais yani bill kaa shat pratishat (real time) milan jiesti kaa sabase buniyadi sudhaar tha kyonki iske aadhaar par kachche maal par chukaaya gaya kar waapas (rifund) hona tha
 This system could never be implemented
 natijatan, jiesti main jamkar frod hue
 a taxpayer paid 6 lakh crores
 ke rifund kaa daawa kar diya, jise baad main sudhara gaya
 Like registration, account matching (invoice matching), the system of tax payment is also eroding
 debit credit card se tex bhugtan aaj tak shuru nahin hua
 Due to these failures, on average only 60 percent taxpayers file returns
 sieji ne dukh ke saath suchit kiya ki jiesti aane ke baad kar eemaandaaree to nahin badi alabatta chori kaaphi bad gai he
 Adherence to tax rules, new taxpayers and increase in consumption (due to concession in tax rates) had to increase revenue, but this improvement has cost the government treasury very expensive
 jiesti lagu hone se pehle (2016-17) main sarkaar ke rajasav main badhotaree kii dar 21
 33 percent which was reduced to about one-fourth i
e
 5
 80 fisad (2017-18) rah gai
 Many taxes were included in the GST, the revenue from the center decreased by 10 percent (2017-18) compared to the revenue from them
 auditor kii report yah bhi bataati he ki sarkaar ne antarraji kaarobaar par lagane vaale igsti ko rajyon ke saath baantne main samvidhan ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya
 Many states have been discriminated against in this
 is gafalat par sieji kii muhar ke baad rajya mukhar ho sakate hai
 This 122-page report examines repeated changes in rules, technical flaws in GSTN, wrong calculations, and says that the government should have understood that a huge omission in large and complex systems like GST is a cause of great loss and inconvenience
 Will be made but here the transition of GST from two years is not complete
 yaad rakhana jaruri he ki us madhya raatri ke jiesti avataran kii gahamagahami ke bich desh kii vikaas dar do fisad badhane kaa sapana bhi dikhaaya gaya tha
 There have been innumerable changes in GST but after this reform not only the consumption of every major product has fallen but the economic growth rate is finding new pits every quarter
 sabase gambhir baat yah he ki vitt mantralay ne tamaam laanat-malamat ke baavjood sieji ko jiesti ke akhil bhartiya aankade kaa audit karne kii chhot nahin di
 The CAG has stated in its report that these flaws have been found on the basis of field audit, so it is a limited audit
 sanad rahe ki jiesti kanoon ke praarambhik praaroop kii dhara 65 ke tahat sieji ko jiesti council se suchanaaen talab karne kaa adhikaar tha lekin aktubar 2017 main jiesti council ne is sudhaar kii nigahabaani se sieji ko dur kar diya
 It is understandable why the government wanted to keep CAG away from GST
 ek ghatiya sudhaar ne arthvyavastha ke do saal barbaad kar die
 The overall audit of the GST and the government's accountability on this failure are now a critique of democracy

 com / 8q6cmwqwis ‘da grand old party’ kaa bura daur khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 At this time, the biggest question before the Congress is who should take over the post of party president and cross the party with political whirlpool
 sutron ke mutabik, buudhvaar ko phir rahul gandhi ne party kii loksabhaa sansadeey dal kii baithak main saaf kar diya ki wo adhyaksh pad par nahin bane rahenge
 The meeting took place in the Parliament House complex in the presence of Sonia Gandhi
 isse thik pehle rahul ke dilli sthit nivas ‘12, tughlaq len’ par youth congress adhyaksh keshav yadav or upaadhyaksh bies shrinivasana kii aguwai main yuva kaaryakartaaon ne ikattha hokar rahul gandhi se adhyaksh bane rahane kaa aagrah kiya tha
 On the other hand, in the presence of Sonia Gandhi in the party office of the Parliament House complex, the party's Lok Sabha mps appealed to Rahul to continue in office
 adhyaksh pad chhodane par ade rahul gandhisutron ke mutabik, band kamare main hui baithak main party saansad manish tiwari or shashi tharur ne tark dete hue rahul se kaha ki, 'zimmedaari kisi ek kii nahin balki samuhik he, is vaqt party ko aapaki sabase zyaada jarurat he
 There is no option but you
 isliye aapako adhyaksh bane rahanaa chahie
 'but Rahul remained adamant and made it clear that,' i have decided, i will not take the responsibility of defeat
 'baithak ke baad rahul gandhi se jab sawaal kiya gaya ki, 'maheenaa ho gaya, aap party adhyaksh par rahenge yaa nahin?' is par rahul ne do took kaha ki, 'maine apana faisla aaj baithak main bataa diya he, main party adhyaksh nahin rahoonga
 Hearing this reply of Rahul, all the mps present in the meeting were stunned
 koi bhi is mudde par aadhikarik taur bolne se bachataa najar aayaa
 In fact, everyone was hoping that, it was more than a month, Congress leaders across the country had appealed to Rahul to continue in office, so everyone was hoping that Rahul would finally agree
 lekin rahul kaa taaja rukh ke baad sabhi kaa maayoos hona lajimi he
 On 23 May 2019, when the Lok Sabha results came, the Congress lost the second consecutive time
 rahul gandhi samet party ko is baar aisi haar kii ummid nahin thi
 Despite campaigning against the Narendra Modi government for a long time, especially on the Rafale deal, the BJP got more seats than in 2014 and again the Modi government came to power with an absolute majority
 rahul gandhi kii party se duuri?
 
 
 In such a situation, Rahul took responsibility for the defeat and offered to resign from the post of Congress President
 itnaa hi nahin kaarysmiti kii baithak main rahul ne yahaan tak kah diya ki, aap log gandhi parivaar se baahar adhyaksh chunie yani sonia gandhi yaa priyanka gandhi kaa naam bhi adhyaksh pad ke liye na len
 However, the Working Committee had rejected Rahul's resignation
 kaarysmiti main sabhi ye maanakar chal rahe the ki, 2014 main sonia kii tarj par rahul der saber maan jaaenge
 Rahul was constantly adamant on resigning from the post of Congress President, when the leaders asked him not to have an alternative, and requested him to continue in the post again
 tab bhi rahul ne doharaa diya tha ki, 'aap log gaiyr gandhi adhyaksh khojie, bas tabhi tak main pad par bana hum
 Meanwhile, Rahul also stopped signing papers for new appointments of Congress as president
 pehle jo niyuktiyaan rahul gandhi ke apruval se hoti thim, ab unki jagah ol india congress cameti ke naam se hone lageen
 Press releases also began to be released in a similar way
 aise main rahul ke taaja rukh ne puri party ko sakate main daal diya
 No party leader is able to dare to suggest the name of himself or anyone else, in which case if not Rahul then the party president? For the Congress, this is the only question which the party is hoping to get a hint from the Gandhi family to solve

 ek lambii or safal pari khilne vaale rachanakarmi ajit kumaar kaa rachana sanchayan aana unke nae-puraane pathakon ke liye nishchay hi pritikar he
 He has simultaneously been the creator of literature, a social thinker and a famous teacher
 unka shaleen vyaktitv, chaatrahitaishi swabhaav or saahitiyik manchon par unka prasann-hdhanjal swar jahaan unhen ek ore vishisht banaata rahaa he, vahiin athmiya bhi
 The same intimacy and intimacy has been a delightful vocal in his creations as well
 kabhi gyaarah panktiyon main unki bahucharchit kaviyon kaa vidroh sheershak kavita saath-sattar ke dashak main 'parampara banaam aadhuniktaa' par chale lambey vimarsh main lagbhag sabhi samakaleen aalochakon dwaara na jane kitni baar uddhrut kii gai thi
 Similarly, Ajit Kumar in his early and well-known poetry collections alone called Kantha Ke, Ankne Do, Yeh Phool Nahin (printed between 1958 and 1970), Gharaunda, for Hirani, Snails and Usar (printed between 1987 and 2001)
 The poem has been stimulating with ideological energy continuously with modern emotion
 aatmbodh ke saath aatmshodh or sandhan kaa anurodh bhi unki kavitaaon main spandit rahata he
 They never separate their authorship from the reader
 isliye unki bahut-si rachanaaen pathakon se kahin adhik swayan ko sambodhit hoti hai
 Such dialogue removes the duality and distance between the poet-reader
 aa
 The Jadi title poem repeats the same thing with a new departure: Today i am a servant, i am free to do whatever they say; No
 ''sarjak or pathak ke bich anubhav kaa saz kaise hota he, use ajit kumaar puri gambhirtha se samajhte hai
 How this language bond of experience bridges the gaps between the two is highlighted in their title poem: It is to understand, to hear, to show / what gaps there are / to fill those gaps - how insufficiently correct / yet indispensable they are
 -the same / familiar, intimate beloved language
 jiske baahar ham jaaen kahin bhi / waapas usee main lautenge
 The language of the poems selected in this collection is drenched in its fun and finesse and is simple-fluid and idiomatic
 kavi ke nijee jivananubhav se samrudh kuch aarambhik kavitaayen romani hai or inamen daanpaty jivan ke kuch madhur mohak kshan or anchhue bimb aaj bhi taaje lagate hai

 vidrohi namdhari ek patrkaar ke pahaado kii saiyr ke bahaane yah behad rochak or romaanchak ho gai he

 isse ekadam ulat subah kaa sapana kahani main narmance ke beche jane kaa lomaharshak ullekh he
 The story may be surrealistic, but the end of a soft arm quotation makes it so sweet, soulful and human that even the nightmare seems to be dear
 is sanchayan kii takat he isamen sankalit do niabandh kavita kaa jivit sansar or akavita se kavita kii ore
 Confident of the speed of the world and the speed of the poem, Kumar also assures us, when before quoting Rituraj's poem (not yet the best poem), he says: "what objection is there to believe that we have bad poetry Good poems from there, very good poems from there and beyond that are moving towards the distant goal of best poetry
 ''kaviver bachchan ke sampurna kavy sansar se hamen parichit karaane vaale ajit kumaar ne ankit hone do (1962) main unase jude chah prasang ukere hai, jinamein unke vyaktitv ke kai pahalu dekhe ja sakate hai, visheshkar 2 farvari, 1960 ko hindi karmchaariyon kii ore se bachchan ke sabhapatitv main manaaya gaya vasantotsav
 The author has told that Bachchan ji believed the core of any poet or creator's reputation was his talent: "if the writer has talent, he will find a way to say it everywhere and under every circumstance
 pratibha he to sab kuch he or nahin he to thenga
 The memoir written on Devishankar Awasthi is extremely touching on the level of sensation

 Waqar told Geo News channel that everyone has to work according to his responsibility
 pakistan ke is purv captain ne kaha, ‘main hum, chayankarta, khilaadi yaa cricket board, sabhi ko apana kaam karnaa he or aise faisle karne hai jo sabhi ke liye sarvshereshth hon
 Asked in reference to his displeasure with his performance as a coach of the PCB, Waqar said, "I didn't think that way and what the PCB will do depends on it
" lekin mujhe pataa he ki abhi sabhi ko dhairya rakhane kii jarurat he kyonki hamane kai senior khilaadi ganvaae hai or nae khilaadiyon ko mauka diya he
 We have a new captain and a new combination so it will take time
 ’input: bhashaa Actress Amrita Rao and Tension
 baat aisi hi he or iskaa sabab hai apane pyaare anil kapur jinaki home production short cat main amrutha heroin hai
 And that's why they became great for him
 swaabhaavik he ki donon ek-duusare kii tarif karen
 But despite this, Anil's next step was like a 440-degree jiggle for Amrita
 vah yah ki yah sukanya unki agali film main nahin hai
 And this brought him shock like a leader who did not get a ticket in the election
 bechaarin! The Lok Sabha election 2019 will be remembered for many things
 chaahe baat bayaanbaji kii ho yaa ek duusare par hamale ke liye narebaaji kaa prayog karnaa
 During this time there were some things which remained away from the eyes of the camera, but it had the most impact on the results
 aaie ek baar un sabhi muddon par najar daudaate hai
 'modi hai toh is possible' This slogan was not only successful but the hard work and strategy behind it was something that made the BJP impregnable in Uttar Pradesh
 kaaryakartaaon ke saath hi prayog kaise sabit hua game changer!bijepi ne chupchaap apane kaaryakartaaon ko ek kaam diya tha or wo kaam tha matdaan ke din subah 10 baje ke pehle puure parivaar kaa vot dalava dena
 It was bjp's own management of booth 'A' grade where BJP has always won
 iske tahat bijepi ne apane boothon par baari matdaan kii ranneeti banaai thi or vah usamen safal rahi
 How activists made the first family vote before refreshment 1 lakh 37 thousand booths in the original minister, where bjp's organization is in it, there are sixty thousand booths of bjp's a grade booths
 jahaan bijepi ne 'jalpan se pehle kaaryakarta parivaar kaa matdaan' kaa abhiyaan safal banaaya
 The bjp's second major program was to reach families benefiting from Prime Minister Modi's schemes
 prayek bijepi ke kaaryakarta ko 5 labhaarthiyon tak pahunchane kaa target diya gaya tha, jise badhaakar bijepi ne 20 kiya or apane chunaav prachaar ke pehle bijepi ne yah target puraa kar liya yani bijepi kaa har kaaryakarta kisi na kisi labhaarthi ke ghar pahunchaa or modi kii yojanaon ke naam par sidhe vot maange
 bjp's General Secretary, Sunil Bansal, who is called Chanakya of BJP organization in Uttar Pradesh, interacted with more than one crore BJP workers and got feedback and this strategy was successful in getting BJP more than 50 percent votes in UP
 jab uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan ban rahaa tha tabhi amit shah ne 51 fisadi vot kaa target tay kiya tha jise puraa karnaa aasaan nahin tha kyonki bijepi ko 2014 main 43 fisadi se zyada vot mili the
 This time, raising 7 percent votes is like a dream come true
 kaise dharaashai hua mahagathbandhan?upi bijepi ke sanghathan mahaamantri sunil bansal ne aaj tak ko bataaya ki 53 siton par bijepi kaa jeetna tay tha 27 siton par kadaa muqabla tha or aisi siton par hi hamaare prabandhan, kaaryakartaaon ke josh or utsaah ne bahut madad pahunchaai
 The Prime Minister's plans and Amit Shah's management skills landed on the ground and the atmosphere built on the ground gave a boost to our election campaign, due to which the Grand Alliance continued to look heavy, but its land kept sliding from below

 rajya main enpipi kshetreey dalon or bhaajapa ke sahyog se gathbandhan sarkaar kii aguwai kar rahi he
 (from input language) narendra modi ko endie sarkaar kaa pradhanmantri bane chaar saal kaa samay puraa ho gaya he
 During this time he laid the foundation of many important schemes
 'saansad adarsh gram yojana' unki aisi hi mahatvakankshi yojanaon main shumaar he
 It was launched by PM Modi on October 2104
 is yojana main loksabhaa or rajyasabha saansadon dwaara teen charnon main teen-teen gaanvon ko god liya janaa tha
 PM Modi started this by saying, 'this will open the doors to good politics
 ' aisa hua bhi jab unke aahvaan par sheersh congressi netaaon sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ne bhi gaanvon ko god liya
 What is Adarsh gram Yojana: Every MP can choose any village in his area, but he will not have his own village or in-laws' village
 saansad adarsh yojana kii teen visheshtaayen honi chahie thim- yah maang par aadhaarit ho, samaaj dwaara prerit ho or isamen janata kii bhagidaari ho
 PM Modi had said at the time of the announcement of this scheme, 'today there are a lot of government schemes
 yojanaon ko ek jagah par le jane se kathinaaiyaan, kamiyaan or inhen saral banane kaa rasta saamne aayega
 Then a change in the system will begin
 'ek saansad ko god lene the 3 gaanvis yojana main 2016 tak prayek saansad ko ek-ek gaanv ko god lekar use viksit karnaa tha
 Two more villages were to be developed by 2019 and eight by 2024
 piem ne rajya sarkaron se bhi apil kii thi ki ve vidhayakon ko is yojana ke liye protsaahit karen to har nirvachan kshetra main 5 se 6 or gaanv viksit ho sakate hai
 On the occasion of the launch of Godis Yojana for three villages, PM Modi had said, 'together we will open the door to a constructive politics and work beyond political untouchability
 pichhali sadi ke mahapurushon jaiprakash narayan, mahatma gandhi, ram manohar lohia or pandit deen dayaal upaadhyaay kaa asar kisi na kisi par aaj bhi he
 Taking all these inspiration, we should carry forward this work
 ' is yojana ke tahat pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane nirvachan kshetra varanasi ke jayapur gaanv, nagepur gaanv or kakadiya gaanv ko god liya
 UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi adopts Udwa village in Rae Bareli while Congress President Rahul Gandhi adopts Deh village in Amethi
 sarkari report main mutabik yojana safalkendre sarkaar ke aankadon ke mutabik yah yojana kaaphi safal rahi he
 In a statement issued by the central government on November 2017, it said that 19,732 projects have been completed under the MP Adarsh gram Yojana and work on 7,204 is in progress
 vaise, sarkaar chaahe jo bhi daawey kare, desh kii anya yojanaon kii tarah piem modi kii yah mahatvakankshi yojana bhi dharaatal tak nahin pahunch saki
 There are enough reasons for this
 funding kaa vishesh intjaam nahinis yojana ko jis tarah se prachaarit kiya gaya, uske str par isaki funding ke intjaam nahin kiye gaye
 No new fund was earmarked for this
 saansadon ko bataaya gaya tha ki desh main chal rahi maujuuda yojanaon- indira awaas yojana, pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana, manaregaa, becoward rigens grant fund, saansad nidhi, gram panchayat kii kamai, centre or rajya vitt ayog nidhi or corporate soshal risponsbility ke hi paise kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 The only phase that the mps showed was the China phase of this plan
 pehle charan ke tahat 2014 se 2016 ke bich ek gaanv ko god lekar use viksit karnaa tha
 During this period, 500 mps out of 543 Lok Sabha mps and 203 mps out of 245 Rajya Sabha mps adopted the villages
 duusare charan yani 2016 se 2018 ke bich keval 340 loksabhaa saansadon or 126 rajya sabha saansadon ne gaanvon ko god liya
 Between the third phase i
e
 2017 to 2019, the adoption of mps in the villages further reduced
 ab tak keval 141 loksabhaa saansadon or 32 rajyasabha saansadon ne hi gaanvon ko god liya he
 Worse, many villages of Adarsh villages were declared as Adarsh villages, but in a few days the condition of those villages became the same as before
 in gaanvon main khud piem modi ke god liye do gaanv- jayapur or nagepur bhi shaamil hai
 Here many works were done under Social Corporate Responsibility (CSR), whose quality started to come out after few months
 adarsh gaanvon kii haalat kya he, ise jaanane ke liye piem modi ke god liye gaye do gaanvon- jayapur or nagepur kii padtaal uchit rahegi ki ve maanakon par kitne khare utarate hai-1- sadakpiem modi ke god lene ke baad varanasi se kareeb 30 kimi dur jayapur or nagepur kii ore aane vaali sadaken shuruyaat main gaddhamukt ho gai thim
 But according to the Economics Times report, by the time of two monsoon seasons i
e
 October 2016, big pits were built on the roads of 10 km of these villages
 vahiin, jayapur gaanv main banaae gaye bas shelter main bench tak nahin bachi hai or log vahaan baithkar taash khelte hai
 2- Safai Bharat campaign was also conducted in these villages, although its result was also not very special
 donon gaanvon main kareeb 400 shauchalay banaae gaye, lekin india today kii padtaal main saamne aayaa tha ki inamen se keval 20 fisadi hi istemaal ho rahe hai
 Some did not have doors and some had water
 shauchalayon ke gadde bhi unke neeche banaae gaye, jisase unhen istemaal karnaa tak dubhar ho gaya
 3- Electricity India India investigation revealed that the neighboring villages of Jayapur get six to seven hours of electricity, while the village started getting 12 to 14 hours of electricity
 isaki vajah vahaan 70 lakh rupee kii laagat se lage 25 kevi ke solar panel hai
 50 KV solar panels were to be installed in Nagepur too, but this issue has been hanging due to non-availability of land
 haalanki, kuch samay baad jayapur ke panel kii bydaree chori ho gai thi or yah khabar surkhiyon main chai rahi thi
 4- Employment of both villages is still awaiting employment opportunities
 iti kii report ke mutabik jayapur gaanv pehle handloom par nirbhar tha
 Later it became known for new ways of farming
 piem modi ke is gaanv ko god lene ke baad se yuvaaon kii ummiden bad gayi
 Instead of farming, he moved towards contracting to earn money quickly
 in gaanvon ke kai logon ne yah sochakar bainkon main khate khulwaaye ki piem kii ore se unke khaaton main paise dalwaae jaaenge
 5- Health and people of Panjayapur village are still waiting for Primary Health Medical Center
 indian express kii report ke mutabik is gaanv main aaj bhi asapataal nahin he
 Two boring pumps for drinking water were installed in Jayapur, a village with 800 families, one of which is often inundated
 inhen chalaane ke liye lagaaya gaya janarator bhi chori ho gaya
 The administration places its responsibility on the villagers that they should take care of the resources of the ideal village
 kya kahati haisansadeey samiti kii reporthaal rahi main shahari vikaas par sansadeey samiti kii ek report main saaf taur par kaha gaya ki funding or uchit kaaryayojna ke abhaav main bharat sarkaar kii mahatvakankshi yojanaayen kaagajon main hi safal hongi
 The report said that only 21 per cent of the funds in the six top schemes of the Modi government related to infrastructure could be used
 ye haal 'smart city' sametaun yojanaon kaa hajhinake liye atirikt fund kii ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 There is no additional fund from the government for Adarsh gram Yojana
 aise main CSR ke bharose adarsh gaanv banane kaa piem kaa sapana sach hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 This is the condition of PM Modi's adopted villages when both the center and the state have their own party government
 andhra pradesh kii nai rajdhani ke liye rajya sarkaar dwaara hazaron acre zamin adhigrahit karne ke faisle ko lekar vipakshi dal or kai saamaajik sanghathan lamaband ho gaye hai
 Last month itself, the Andhra Pradesh government issued a notification for the new capital to develop 7,068 square kilometers of land in Vijayawada and adjoining districts
 iske saath hi sainkadon gaanvon kii zamin adhigrahit karne kii taiyaari shuru ho gai he
 Now the people affected by this decision have started protesting in association with local social organizations and in this campaign they are also getting the support of political parties
 unka aarope he ki jameen adhigrahan adhyadesh jari hone ke saath andhra sarkaar ke liye bade str par zamin adhigrahan karnaa aasaan ho gaya he
 Now the Andhra mass organizations surrounded by this indictment have reached Delhi and are going to start protest in the capital this week
 andhra congress ke samarthan se yah maamla raajnneetik ho gaya he
 Leader of the Opposition in Andhra Legislative Council c Ramachandraiah told NDTV, 'chandra Babu Naidu wants to build a bigger capital than Hyderabad
 iske liye wo ek lakh acre zamin tak adhigrahit karnaa chaahate hai
 For this, preparations are being made to acquire 30,000 acres of land in the first phase
 ' Now Andhra Congress has started preparing to go to Supreme Court against this decision
 andhra pradesh congress cameti ke mahasachiv ji rudra raju ne enditivi ko bataaya, 'ham sthaneey prabhavit logon ko saath lekar iske khilaaf supreme court main PIL karenge
 We have decided to fight a legal battle against this
 ' The Andhra government notified about 7000 square kilometers of land for the new capital last month, after which this buzz has been going on
 udhar is virodh ke baavjood endie sarkaar ne bajet satr ke dauraan haal ke maheenon main jari zamin adhigrahan sahit sabhi adhyadeshon ko bill main badalane kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 In a meeting of senior ministers on Tuesday, it was decided that the relevant bill for converting all ordinances into law would be prepared by 1 February
 bajet satr se thik pehle ek taraf sarkaar zamin adhigrahan adhyadesh ko kanoon main badalane kii taiyaari kar rahi he to vahiin duusari taraf vipakshi dal or saamaajik sanghathan iske khilaaf phir lamaband ho rahe hai
 It will now be important to see how the government deals with this protest during the budget session

 Actually, the employees of the company say that we have been fired from our job without giving any notice

 ’ West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has called Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar thank you
 mamata ne nitish ko thank you kyon kaha, isko lekar kai sawaal uth rahe hai
 However, Mamata Banerjee is thanking JDU for her decision to contest alone in four states
 yani in rajyon main jediu endie main shaamil nahin rahegaa
 But is this the only reason, this is also the question
 jediu kii rashtriya kaaryakaarani ne ravivaar ko faisla kiya ki wo jharkhand, dilli, haryana or jammu kashmir kaa vidhansabha chunaav apane dam par ladenge
 Meaning she will not join the NDA alliance in these states
 jediu ke is faisle se mamata banerjee ko itani khush hui ki unhone nitish kumaar ko dhanyavad de diya
 But after all the speculation in this executive, JDU also decided that it will contest the 2020 assembly elections in Bihar under the leadership of Nitish Kumar with BJP
 magar sawaal ye uthta he ki jin chaar rajyon main jahaan jediu kaa vishesh prabhaav nahin he vahaan akele chunaav ladane ke faisle par mamata itani khush kyon hui hai
 While JDU will contest elections with BJP in its constituency Bihar and leave the four years in between, Nitish Kumar has been in alliance for the last 23 years
 lekin us par mamata banerjee ne kuch nahin kaha
 Does Mamata not want JDU to contest elections in Bengal or is so happy because of Nitish Kumar's soft attitude on Prashant Kishore? mamata banerjee or jediu ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh prashanth kishor kii haal main hi mulaakaat hui jisamen bengal 2021 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main prashanth kishor kii sanstha 'ai pack' se madad lene par baat hui
 Questions also arose in Bihar about this
 jediu party main hote prashanth kishor kaise trinmul congress (TMC) kii madad kar sakate hai
 Because he is in the NDA with the BJP, but the party's national president Nitish Kumar has fiercely defended his national vice-president Prashant Kishore, who is associated with the i-pack organization
 lekin mukhyamantri or jediu ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne somvaar ko kaha ki prashanth kishor hamaare party ke sadsy hai
 As far as the matter is related to their terrorist organization i Pack, it is a different thing, it is not right to link its link with the political member who is directly with the person
 ai pack kaa jediu se koi sambandh nahi he
 If Prashant Kishore is in the party, he will work for the party
 bengal main bijepi ke badhate prabhaav kii vajah se mamata sankat main hai or is sankat se ubarne ke liye wo tamaam tarah ke upaay main lagi hai
 Perhaps she wants the JDU to contest elections in Bengal like four states
 isse unhen phayda ho saktaa he kyonki bengal main bihar ke bahut voter hai jo abhi bijepi ko vot dete hai
 In such a situation, if JDU contests there, TMC can benefit from it
 halaki jediu ke rashtriya mahasachiv ne kaha ki jediu chaahati he ki bengal main mamata kii party kii haar ho

 Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha has claimed that the flagship schemes of the NDA government National Highway Development Project (NHDP) and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) are the result of his thinking

 pichley saal bhaajapa chhod chuke sinha ne kaha daawa kiya ki pradhanmantri gram sadak yojana bhi unheen kii soch he
 Sinha also recalled meeting Vajpayee in his book in which he had suggested for the first time to start a new scheme for construction of roads in villages and to create separate funds for it
 sinha ne kaha, 'maine suzav diya tha ki yojana kaa naam atal bihari vaajapeyi gram sadak yojana rakhaa janaa chaiye
 Vajpayee accepted my idea of starting the scheme, but rejected the suggestion to name it after himself
 'sinha ne duusare logon dwaara unki soch kaa shrey lene par "dukh" jataate hue spasht kiya ki unhone vaajapeyi dwaara in yojanaon kaa shrey lene par kabhi bura nahin mana kyonki vah "sarkaar ke pramukh" hone ke alaava hamaare sheersh netaa bhi the

 In a private channel talk show, Ranveer Singh told that before starting his film career, he used to give coffee to people at Starbucks in America
 par aapako yah jaanakar hairaani hogi ki vahaan coffee pine ke liye aane vaali ladkiyaan tab bhi ranvir kii adaaon par fida thim
 So what does Ranveer do after that that girls get impressed by him so soon
 aaiye jaanate hai ranvir ke sikret ke bare main
 
 
 Hansaranvir's sense of humor is very good
 ladkiyaan aise ladakon ko hi pasand karti hai, jinke saath wo khulkar hans saken
 Boring and serious mood boys are rarely liked by girls
 ranvir kaa maananaa he ki ladki ke saath chemistry bananaa jaruri he or iske liye aap use hansaaen or uske liye bich jaaen
 That means that the girl has to believe that if she says day and night, then you will only say night
 saaf baat kahenladakiyon ko impress karne ke liye jhooth bolne kii jarurat nahin he
 Please tell clearly what to say
 ranvir bhi ye maanate hai ki agar aap usase kuch chhipaayenge to use samaj aa jayega
 She may not say anything to you, but she will not be able to believe you
 # Agenda16: beficre andaaj main aae ranvir singhbollywood kii copy main buraai nahinkoi ladki kahe yaa na kahe, use filmi andaaj behad pasand aata he
 If one is happy with copying Bollywood, then there is no harm in it
 agar aap aisa karange to uske liye yah sapane ke sach hone jaisaa hoga
 Eyeballs are mere eyesight, things cannot be done with a tongue
 ladakiyon kii ankhon main ankhen daalkar dekhen
 Perhaps then Ranveer is often seen seeing Deepika in pictures
 yah puraani trick he, ranvir ne iskaa acha yuj kiya he
 can be seen in the role of Kapil Dev, the Chill boys like those who do not make small matters an issue
 khush rahen or khush rahane den
 Do not like too many frills, who do not try to impose their will in the matter and do not take tension of everything
 jo jivan se bharaa ho or khub sari masti karata ho, bilkul ranvir kii tarah

 To improve the work culture and transparency of officers and employees, the government has given strict instructions to make biometric attendance for personnel from top level to lower level
 lekin iskaa anupaalan sheersh par baithe bahut kam adhikari kar rahe hai
 13 officers of the All India Service working in the Jharkhand Ministry have not yet registered their presence in the month of August
 jabaki ve har din mantralay aate hai
 One officer has only one day, among the other big officers, one has registered 9, the other has 10 and the third has made 14 days of attendance
 vahiin agar isaki tulana rajya seva ke adhikariyon se kii jaae to maamla ekadam ulat najar aata he
 State Administrative Service officers are the first to register attendance through biometric method
 ausatan 80-85 fisadi afasar is paddati se atendence bana rahen hai
 An interesting point has come out here that the officers posted in the CMO and CSO are not interested in applying the attendant
 in aankadon ke adhyayan se ek baat or saamne ai ki biomitric atendence mashin lagane ke baad mantralay main kaam kar rahe 57 fisadi karmchaaree samay se pehle karyaalay pahunch rahe hai
 Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghuvar Das has given strict instructions that officers who do not comply with the biometric attendance should be deducted their salary
 unhone upasthiti ke baavjood atendence nahin banane vaale karmiyon ko anupasthit ghoshit karne tak kaa aadesh de rakhaa he
 However, in the initial phase, employees of some departments like forest and police strongly opposed this method, which often disappeared from office in the name of field trips
 lekin sarkaar ke sakht rukh kii vajah se virodh ke swar dab gaye
 However, these figures definitely prove that while employees and small officers are complying with these rules, the big officers are violating these rules openly
 notebandi vitt mantri arun jetali ko duvidha ke dilachasp mode par le ai he
 Ghalib wrote that i have stopped me, pulled me Kufr, Jaitley is in similar condition
 notebandi kii tapasya ke baad log unase kar riyaayaton kii raah par bahak jane kii ummid kar rahe hai jabaki vitt mantri ke taur par unka imaan isaki ijaajat harigaj nahin detaa
 How many tax payers are there in the country! Only a handful
 asankhya koshishon or computarikaran, pan or tids niyamon main badlaav ke baad pichley do saalon me inakam tex kaa sangrah bamushkil dahaai kii growth darj kar paaya he
 Any big concession will divert such hard work, which we can only guess by looking at the figures
 yah rahe kuch tathy jo bataate hai ki kyon vitt mantri notebandi kii qurbaani kaa dariyadil inam shaayad na de paaen
 In the last economic survey, an interesting data about income tax was published, according to: -1
 bharat main 2
 There are 8 crore tax payers
 2
 Of these, only 25 lakh people are those whose income is above one million rupees
 is varg main aane waalon kii ausat salanaa inakam 24
 7 lakhs
 3
 54 lakh people have an income of five to ten million
 jinaki ausat kamai 6
 5 lakhs
 4
 About 2
 07 karod log do se paanch lakh rupee kii inakam vaale hai
 Whose average income 2
 9 lakh rupee he
 5
 2
 Income up to Rs 5 lakh is tax free and 2
 5 se paanch lakh rupee tak kii aay par das fisadi tex lagata he
 • If the Finance Minister also increases the tax free income limit to Rs 50,000, ie, increasing it to Rs 3 lakh, then a very large proportion of taxpayers falling in the tax limit of 10% (about one crore out of two crores)
 People will get out of the tax net
 kyonki is varg main aane vaale tex peyar kii ausat aay 2
 9 lakhs
 jaahir he ki koun sa vitt mantri itane badetex besako jutaney kii mehnat par pani pherana chahega
 The speculation and expectation is that instead of abandonment of demonetisation, people are expecting to get tax free of income up to four lakh rupees and up to five lakh rupees
 unhen yah jaan lenaa chahie ki agar paanch lakh rupee tak kii aay tex free ho jaae to sarkaar ko 37000 karod rupee kaa rajasav ganvaana hoga jo ki kul inakam tex sangrah (2015
 16) is more than ten per cent xxrep 4 ! The lump sum black money from demonetisation and the tax on it is not to be lenient
 yah riyaayat to ek baargi hogi lekin iske badale tex base badhaane kii koshishon ko jo palitha lagegaa uski bharpai lambey vakt main ho sakegi
 The story is that if the Finance Minister has decided to exclude more than one crore tax payers from the tax net, then only he will show the kind of generosity that is being expected
 inakam tex riyaayat ke alaava bharat main vitt mantriyon paas krupaalu hone kaa koi sidhaa vikalp nahin he
 There is also a politics of income tax concessions according to the sacred traditions of electoral politics
 is ravaayat ke aadhaar par is bajet ke saath modi sarkaar ke liye riyaayaton vaale bajaton kaa silsilaa shuru ho rahaa he
 Due to demonetisation, this sequence has been started a year ago
 nahin to dariyaadilii kaa mauka agle saal ke bajet main aata
 If the Finance Minister will distribute the big gift in this budget, then in the next two budgets, you are wise yourself

 Just think what will happen to the people living here

 The people here have no place for trouble and the business of the shopkeepers has come to a standstill
 yahaan koi bas stop nahin he, ye khud ditisi ne mana jab arpit bhargav ne artiai ke jariye sawaal uthaade
 In 2009, DTC removed the bus stand's root plate from the pillar outside their house, but reinstalled the pillar next to it
 yani ditisi kii ye avaidh parking band nahin hui
 The biggest difficulty is that when people ask them to remove the buses, the drivers are abusive
 arpit or uske parivaar ne haar nahin maani, maamle ko adaalat le gaye taaki roj roj kii kichakich se chhutkaaraa mili
 The court has given the verdict in favor of Arpit and has said that he should once again put his problem in front of the DTC in writing and within two weeks the DTC has to decide that if there is no bus stop then how can he settle here Let's terminate
 ye ladaai sirf arpit kii nahin he
 Due to this illegal parking of DTC, shopkeepers are also incurring heavy losses

 The theft is said to be because the bus stop was built here after eliminating the pavement and then the ticket house

 The court has now given two weeks time to resolve the case
 court ne kaha he ki ditisi aise upaay kare ki bas terminal se yachikakarta ko kisi tarah kii dikkat na ho
 On this, the DTC put the ball in the petitioner's court and asked that the petitioner himself give a representation before the DTC and explain what are the possible points to terminate the bus

 They are accused of plotting the 2007 Samjhauta train bombings, the Mecca Masjid and the Ajmer Dargah, as well as the right-wing Hindu terror conspiracy

 Anyway, why did Chaturvedi, a 'national convener' of Abhinav Bharat, a close-knit purohit and right-wing organization Abhinav Bharat, raise objections in the hearing of Justice Desai, even though she had gone to the Supreme Court till the Bombay High Court verdict? It is said that Justice Desai had heard seven times in the High Court
 adaalat ne antat: chaturvedi or duusare aropiyon ko jamaanat nahin di thi
 Rather, it allowed the NIA to strictly enforce the provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA), which meant that the court also felt that the bombings may have links to a larger terrorist group
 chaturvedi ke patr ke bare main enie ke ek adhikari kaa kahana he, ''agency in aapattiyon ko lekar chintit nahin he

 In such a situation, we tell that Ajit Pawar, who is the kingmaker of the power of Maharashtra, and how he has emerged as the uncrowned king in politics today
 ajit pavaar kaa janm 22 july, 1959 ko maharashtra ke ahmednagar jile main hua
 Ajit Pawar is the son of NCP President Sharad Pawar's elder brother Anantrao Pawar
 ajit pavaar apane chachaa ke nakshekadam par chalate hue raajnneeti main aae

 sharad pavaar ke saath ajit pavaar bhi congress se alag ho gaye or ensipi kaa gathan kiya
 The MLA has been elected from Baramati seat for the seventh time in this year's Maharashtra assembly elections

 He exhorted the media that when water logging takes place in places like Mumbai and America, what becomes of media aggression? Nitish Kumar, however, forgot the charge that the government of Mumbai prepares before the monsoon to deal with the rains in Mumbai or any other city
 jabaki rajdhani patna main unke yah dekhne ko mila ki pani nikaalane ke adhikttar pump yaa to apni kshamta se kam kaam kar rahe the yaa phir ve band pade the
 Nitish Kumar appealed to the media to raise awareness on climate change
 is baat main koi vivaad nahin hai ki jalajmav ke bahaane chamaki bukhaar kii tarah nitish kumaar ko media kaa ek tabaka jisaki bhakthi unke sahyogi bhaajapa sarkaron or netaaon ke liye jagazahir hai ke nishane par wo ek baar phir hai
 There are no two views on the fact that the Nitish government has ignored Patna's town planning during its rule

 All the mlas in Patna belong to the BJP

 Relief and rescue operations were fiercely undertaken
 lekin yah bhi sach hai ki unhone jo bhi hua or jo ho rahaa hai uske bare main media se baat karne kii jarurat nahin samajhi
 Senior journalists believe that it made it easier for the media, especially the dock media, to make them villains
 isliye nitish kumaar ne khud se apane upar hamale ko aamantran diya
 At present, even supporters of Nitish Kumar believe that their leader has got two lessons on the pretext of water logging
 ek aap kisi vibhaag kii upeksha karane yaa apane sahyogi ke bharose chodenge to jab bhi jalajmav jaisi samasya hogi, tab aap janata or media donon ke nishane par rahenge

 a post shared by Luca Luce (@lucaluceartgallery_makeup) on Dec 25, 2018 at 12:01pm PST There is a strange question and decision too
 ek beti jo balig he wo apni marji se shaadi karnaa chaahati he
 Also charges tax
 magar beti kaa baap shaadi ke khilaaf he
 The Father is also an MLA from above
 ab beti or uskaa pati dar ke maare chhupate phirte hai, par kab tak
 So they come on social media asking for help
 baat fail jaati he
 Questions are asked from the Father
 ab sari safai ke saath-saath khud baap bhi ek sawaal puch baithta he
 The question is that as a father does he not have the right to marry the daughter or think of her good or bad? After considering Siyaram as a witness, Sakshi chose Ajitesh to be the companion of the next seven births
 isi kunda ke saamne saat phere liye saath jeene kii kasame khain
 By ringing the bell of this temple, both of them promised each other to be happy in every situation
 sab kuch hindu reeti rivaaj ke hisaab se
 Except Marriage Certificate
 wo in donon ne sirf samaaj ko dikhaane ke liye banwaaya he
 Because the householder can give the daughter the desired toy
 beti jahaan chaahe us restaurant main khaanaa khilaa sakate hai
 They can teach from expensive to expensive college
 almukhtsar main beti apane baap se kuch bhi maang sakati he
 He simply does not have the right to choose his own partner by his own will
 bas itani si khataa kar lee sakshi ne pyaar kar liya
 And this enemy of love is from ages to ages
 naa jane kitne pyaar karne vaale isaki sazaa bhugat chuke hai
 Actually, even the haters want to keep these rights with them
 assam main nafrat ye chaahati he mohabbat bhi tol-mol ke ho
 But there is a love that is not known
 ho jaati he
 And maybe that's why hate is hate love
 lihaaza hameshaa se ye koshish kii jaati rahi he ki mohabbat ko is berahami se kuchlaa jaae ke phir koi mohabbat kaa naam naa le
 Don't know why we have to go to Mars
 kyon ye satellite or rocket bananaa he
 Which will we change after going there
 vahaan bhi yaheen hoga
 So it is better to stay here
 yug badal gaye
 Thousands of millions passed
 magar ham nahin badale
 Lord Ram himself could not change even by eating the false plum of Sabari
 gautam buddha se hamane kuch nahin siikhaa
 Gandhi
 ambedkar ne bevajaah apni jaane gavaayin
 We were like this
 aise hi hai or aise hi rahenge
 Great religions are made by people who, even after reading the books of religion, do not understand that the makers have not made a difference
 magar is samaaj main vahi sach or vahi sahi he jo uske khaanche main utre
 Otherwise, the loved ones are responsible for their own ruin
 ji bareli ke bijepi vidhayak rajesh mishra kii beti se shaadi kar ke ajitesh apni zindagi kii sabase badi galati kar di he
 The influence of MLA in the area is such that even without his consent, the leaf does not move
 ajitesh ne to unke singhaasana ko hilaa diya he
 The risk of life will remain till life
 upar se soobe main sarkaar bhi mishra ji kii he
 The domination of police administration is a minor matter
 aise main ab agar ajithesh ko koi bachaa saktaa tha to wo tha soshal media
 After falling in love with Sakshi, death is hovering over Ajitesh
 parivaar waalon kii jaan bhi khatre main hai
 Along with Ajitesh and Sakshi, Ajitesh's entire family is also running away due to fear of MLA and his goons
 pita harish ajitesh or sakshi kii shaadi kii khabar sunate hi bareli se sapariwaar noida bhaag aae hai
 And are seeking protection from the administration
 mukhyamantri yogi se fariyaad lagaai he
 After Ajitesh's video, his father's fear is clearly telling that the lives of his entire family are in danger
 or udhar vidhayak ji ke log kisi bhi haal main ajitesh or sakshi ko dhundhakar unhen sazaa dene ko betaab hai
 While in the viral video, Sakshi is clearly saying that she has married this on her own free will

 When he was the Chief Minister, he used to make headlines due to his controversial statements and after going to the Chief Minister's chair, he kept in the headlines by attacking Nitish Kumar
 lekin kabhi-kabhi media se dosti pareshaani kaa kaaran bhi ban jaati he
 Manjhi has kept some spokespersons who are mindful of how to propagate Manjhi
 lichi-aam par police kaa paharaa bhi inhen pravaktaaon ke dimag kii upaj thi
 But on Friday, Manjhi and his spokespersons got back on track
 paryaavaran diwas par media waalon ko mukhyamantri awaas bulaayaa gaya ki purv mukhyamantri maanjhi kuch ped lagaayenge
 The media persons also arrived with full preparation and by the time Manjhi came to plant the trees, the eyes of the media persons were on the bottle of liquor which was lying in the Chief Minister's lawn
 ab sawaal he ki sharaab kii bottle kahaan se ai
 The comments nishchit rup se baahar se aa nahin sakati
 This bottle must have been used by someone living in the Chief Minister's residence and the bottle was thrown there
 maanjhi jab thodi der baad aae or unase is sambandh main sawaal poocha gaya to iske liye bhi unhone nitish kumaar ko jimmevaar tehraakar media waalon ko vahaan se jane kaa aadesh diya
 But the question remains as to who drank the liquor, the people in safety or any member of Manjhi's family
 maanjhi ne kuch pravaktaa rakhe hai jo is baat par dimag lagaate hai ki aakhir maanjhi kaa prachaar prasar kaise kiya jaye
 The police watch over the litchi-mango was also the brainchild of these spokesmen
 lekin shuukravaar ko maanjhi or unke pravaktaaon kii chaal thodi ulti pad gai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi can take part in the famous Aishbag Ramlila in Lucknow this time on Dussehra
 bijepi netaaon ke anusaar, pradhanmantri se iske liye anurodh kiya gaya he or ab unki aupchaarik 'haa' kaa intjaar he
 State BJP leaders have started preparations for a possible visit to the Prime Minister
 lakhanu ke eshbagh kii ramlila desh kii sabase pracheen or aitihaasik ramlilaon main se ek he
 It is believed that after Tulsidas created Ramcharitmanas, his disciples started this Ramlila about three hundred years ago
 yah ganga-jamuni tahjeeb kaa pratik bhi he
 This Ramlila continued during the rule of the Nawabs
 19 veen shatabdi main shriramlila samiti eshbagh kaa panjikaran karaayaa gaya tha
 Dinesh Sharma, Mayor of Lucknow and National Vice President of BJP, is the patron of Sriramalila Samiti Aishbagh
 sharma ne bataaya ki unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi se anurodh kiya he ki ve is ramlila main aaen
 Normally, all the Prime Ministers have been participating in the programs of Ramlila committees at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi, however in 2014, Prime Minister Modi was not invited to the Ravana Dahan program there because Chief Patron and former Congress MP Jayaprakash Aggarwal opposed the presence of PM Modi
 did
 iske baad piem modi ne subhash maidan main ravan dahan kaarykram main hissaa liya tha
 The historic Ramlila of Aishbagh was once held by elephants, horses and chariots throughout the grounds
 baad main ise manch par kar diya gaya
 Ram Bhawan and Tulsi Bhavan have also been constructed there
 pichley saal eshbagh ramlila kii theme gohatya pratibandh thi or manch kaa nirmaan ayodhya main prastaavit ram mandir kii tarah kiya gaya tha
 This year, artists from Thailand have also been invited to Ramlila
 gauratlab he ki bijepi ne tay kiya he ki rajya main aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon ke maddenjar pradhanmantri maheene main kam se kam ek baar uttar pradesh jarur aaen
 The BJP says that the pm's visit to Lucknow on Dussehra will excite the enthusiasm of the workers
 eshbagh kii aitihaasik ramlila kabhi puure maidan main hathi-ghodon or rathon ke jariye hoti thi
 It was later put on stage
 vahaan ram bhawan or tulsi bhawan kaa nirmaan bhi kiya gaya he
 The theme of Aishbagh Ramlila last year was cow slaughter ban and the stage was constructed like the proposed Ram temple in Ayodhya
 is saal ramlila main thailand ke kalakaaron ko bhi bulaayaa gaya he
 Significantly, the BJP has decided that the Prime Minister must come to Uttar Pradesh at least once a month in view of the upcoming assembly elections in the state
 bijepi kaa kahana he ki dashahara par piem ke lakhanu aane se kaaryakartaaon kaa josh dogana ho jayega
 During the Lok Sabha elections, political parties are engaged in campaigning as well as lashing out at the opposition parties
 is chhintakashi ke dauraan vibhinn netaaon dwaara istemaal kiye gaye shabd jaise 'aresavipi model', 'toffee model', 'eke-49', 'khabaron ke kaarobaari', 'jijaji', 'maa-betaa sarkaar', 'shahjada' raajnneeti ke nae muhaavarey banakar ubhare hai
 This new dictionary of politics certainly reveals the nature of existing politics
 bijepi ke netaa narendra modi is maamle main sabase aage najar aate hai
 However, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was also heard using many such words
 desh kii raajnneeti main shaayad yah pehla aisa loksabhaa chunaav he, jisamen chaay vikreta itani charchaa main hai
 The BJP started its campaign under the name 'chai Pe Charcha' to capitalize on Modi's tea seller
 is loksabhaa chunaav main jahaan corporate vigyapanon kii tarj par hi bhavy chunaav prachaar dekhne ko mil rahaa he, vahiin pehali baar raajnneetik aarope-pratyaropon main desh ke kuch bade udyogpatiyon par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa gaya
 The debate sparked by the bjp-promoted and much-talked about Gujarat's development model gave many new phrases to the political lexicon
 rahul gandhi ne gujarat model ko 'toffee model' kii sangya dete hue kaha ki gujarat sarkaar ne udyogpatiyon ko toffee kii keemat par jaminen bech deen
 While attacking the Gujarat model, Rahul also called it a 'T20 match'
 rahul ne ek intervyuu main kaha, 'unhone (modi) ek hi vyakti ko 45 hajaar acre jameen de di
 In land allotment as if they are playing T20 matches
 ham aisa nahin karte
 The bjp's claims of victory in the Lok Sabha elections were described by Rahul Gandhi as a bloated balloon and said that it would explode like the 2004 and 2009 elections
 rahul ne ek chunavi raily main modi par sidhe nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha, 'vah (modi) desh kaa chaukeedaar bananaa chaahate hai
 Modi responded fiercely to every attack he made on behalf of the Congress and ridiculed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, often calling him 'shahzada'
 modi ne ek chunavi bhaashan ke dauraan kaha, 'shahjada apane gubbaaron or toffiyon ke saath khel rahe honge
 The country wants a mature leader and wants to win more and more trophies
 'namakan patr main pehali baar apni vaivaahik sthiti kaa zikr karne ke kaaran chaaron taraf se hamalon kaa shikaar hue modi ne javaabi hamale main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke damaad robert wadra ke bhoomi vivaad par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Modi also addressed Vadra by the name 'jijaji' during his many speeches and termed the Gandhi family as RSVP (rahul, Sonia, Vadra, Priyanka) model
 modi ne congress ke saath-saath uttar pradesh kii samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue congress nit sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan upie sarkaar ko 'maa-betaa sarkaar' or akhilesh yadav kii upi sarkaar ko 'baap-betaa sarkaar' kaha
 Apart from rival political parties, Modi also targeted the media and even called some journalists as 'news traders'
 modi ne patrakaron par aarope lagaaya ki ve gujarat main unke kaaryon ko na dikhaakar udyogpatiyon se unki mulakaaton ko hi khabar main dikhaate hai
 Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of the barely two-year-old party AAP that raised slogans against corruption, has been called 'AK-49' by Modi
 modi ne kejariwal kii baat-baat par dharna dene or 49 din kii dilli sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue yah muhaavara uchhaala
 Although Kejriwal was not heard using such idioms against other political parties or leaders, he must repeatedly repeat jokes like 'usul', 'politics in politics', 'truth and honesty' in every address
 Can be heard mumbai ke sheersh bilderon main se ek tathaa bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke vidhayak ne sarkaar se kaha he ki pakistan ke sansthaapak or 'kaayda-e-aazam' kahe jane vaale mohammad ali jinna dwaara banwaaya gaya mumbai sthit aaleeshaan ghar dhaha diya janaa chahie
 Mangal Prabhat Lodha, the promoter and MLA of a large real estate developer company in Mumbai city called the financial capital of the country, said in the assembly that Jinnah House in South Mumbai should be demolished, and replaced by a cultural center
 needed
 gauratlab he ki jinna house dhai acre zamin par bana hua he, jisaki anumaanit keemat 40 karod america dollar (lagbhag 2,603 karod rupee) he
 Mangal Prabhat Lodha said, "jinnah's residence in South Mumbai is where the partition (partition of the country) was hatched
" 
 
 jinna house vibhaajan kaa pratik he
