 The judge said that Devyani was exempted from going to India on 9 January
 nyaayadhish ne kaha, agar devayani ko giraftaar ke samay yaa ab bhi chhot nahin hasil he, tab bhi adaalat kii kaarywahiyon ke lambit hone ke dauraan unke rajanyik chhot hasil karne se abhiyog khaarij hota he
 The judge said that Devyani appeared before the court on 9 January after the prosecution was re-imposed and appealed to dismiss the case
 aadesh main kaha gaya, chunki adaalat ke paas us samay or abhiyog kaa byora laae jane ke samay devayani ko lekar nyaayadhikaar nahin tha, unki yachika manjuur kii jaani chahie
 The judge said, Devyani's plea to dismiss the suit on the basis of diplomatic exemption is accepted
 devayani kii jamaanat kii sharton ko khatm kiya jaataa he or unke muchalke ko behaal kiya jaataa he
 It is ordered that the arrest warrants given on the basis of this indictment should be canceled

 Need for introduction of PRP system The Pay Commission has recommended that the system of Payment of Work (PRP) should be introduced for all categories of Central Government employees
 uske anusaar aisi dharna he ki vetan main badhotaree or padonnati swaabhaavik rup se hoti he
 There is also the notion that career advancement (modified Assured Career progression-macp) is taken in a more general way, while it is related to employee functioning

 As such, the Commission proposes to prevent annual increases in salaries of employees who do not meet the criteria set for MACP or regular promotions during their first 20 years of service
 ’laaparvaahee par lagegi lagaam, badhegi kaaryakshamtavetan ayog ne sarkaar ko saunpi apni report main kaha, ‘yah laaparvaah or aksham karmchaariyon ke liye pratirohak kaa kaam karegaa

 The Commission at this time turned down the demand to increase the gap

 The Pay Commission believes that there should be a credible framework for central government employees to enhance the functioning of ministries and departments through PRP

 The question raised over the successful statement of Sivan: The demand for investigation of the technology of Vikram Lander, Chief of Indian Space Agency ISRO (dr
 ISRO)
 ke
 Sivan had said that we had 98% success in Chandrayaan-2 mission
 unhone kaha tha ki isro kaa vikram lander or pragyan rover se sampark nahin ho paaya
 But Chandrayaan-2's Orbiter is working correctly
 yah kareeb saadhe saat saal tak hamen chand se sambandhit aankaden or tasviren bhejtaa rahegaa
 But after this statement by ISRO Chief, many senior scientists of the country are questioning this statement of Sivan
 ek vaigyanik ne soshal media par post daalkar isro ke netritv or rocket science par lekh likhaa he
 Unable to contact the lander, ISRO Chief said - Now Mission Gaganyaan is our priority
 a senior scientist has claimed that making such a statement without serious introspection makes us a laughingstock in front of the world
 vahiin, isro ke sutron ke maane to vikram lander tay gati se bahut zyada gati se jaakar chand kii sataha par takaraayaa he
 Now it is impossible to contact him
 ab wo hameshaa ke liye kho chukaa he
 Scientist Tapan Mishra said in gestures - Leadership in ISRO is getting rare
 Tapan Mishra, advisor to ISRO chairman and former director of Space Applications Center Ahmedabad has written an article on social media
 isamen bina isro chif sivan kaa naam liye unhone isro ke netritv par sawaal uthaae hai
 Tapan Mishra has written that leaders always inspire, they do not manage
 bataa den, ki sivan ke isro chif banane ke turant baad hi tapan mishra ko spes aplicoshan centre ahmedabad ke nideshak pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 Tapan Mishra has written that when suddenly the system of obeying rules increases, paperwork gets increased, meetings start taking place, more things start happening, then it should be assumed that leadership (leadership) in your institute is now becoming rare
 Used to be

 After recovering, he starts walking again
 isliye jab bhi kisi spescraft yaa rocket ke saath kuch gadabad ho jaae tab bhi aapako maikenic ko nahin bhoolanaa chahie
 It is very important to have 100 percent confidence in space science and technology
 tapan mishra aage likhte hai ki jab bhi aap koi mashin antariksh main bhejte hai, tab aapako kai sudharatmak upaay karne hote hai
 Because there is no person in space who fixes the mess
 aapako us mashin ko antariksh main bhejne se pehle kai baar antariksh main maahaul ke hisaab se jaanch lenaa chahie
 All possible troubles should be examined by that machine
 ye kaisaa inaam? Chandrayaan-2 se pehle sarkaar ne kaati ISRO vaigyanikon kii tankhwaahabhartiya mul ke vaigyanik bharat thakkar ne kaha vikram lander ke dizin kii jaanch halmerica main rahane vaale bhartiya mul ke vaigyanik bharat thakkar ne kaha ne bhi vikram lander ko lekar gunvattta niyantran or bharosemand karypranali par kai saidhantik sawaal uthaae hai
 Bharat Thakkar said that a post-mortem should be done regarding the mechanical design of Vikram Lander
 ye pataa karnaa chahie ki vikram ke maikenical dizin main suraksha ko lekar kya-kya vyavastha kii gai thi
 Has any work been done on this? See

 This technology could have been easier
 unhone kaha ki ekasaath paanchon thrusters ko on or barabari ke str par sanchalit karnaa thodaa mushkil he
 We should have worked on the same powerful engine
 is vaigyanik ne aarope lagaaya he ki isro ke ucchadhikariyon ne chandrayan-1 main kaam karne vaale budhimaan or anbhavi vaigyanikon ko kinare kar diya tha

 Let us know that the heat throughout the country has hurt people
 monsoon ne 8 june ko ek saptaah kii deree se kerala main dastak di thi
 It started raining in different parts of the country when Cyclone Vayu took shape in the Arabian Sea on 10 June
 uske baad monsoon kii barish tham si gai
 From 11 June, the monsoon surge completely stopped
 barish main 43 fisadi kamimausam ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik, puure desh main monsoon kii barish main baari kami record kii gai he
 63 across the country from 1 June to 15 June
 2 millimetre kii ausat barish ke mukaable 36
 5 mm of rain was recorded
 is tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki abhi tak monsoon kii barish 43 fisadi kam rahi he
 When the cyclone 'vayu' took shape in the Arabian Sea, the Meteorological Department had predicted that it would reach Saurashtra in Gujarat on 13 June
 haalanki, chakravaat ‘vaayu’ jab gujarat ke tateey ilaake ke paas pahunchaa to usne apni disha badal di or yah tufaan uttar-uttar pashchim disha main chal diya
 Here cyclonic storm 'vayu' changed its direction once again
 taaja anumaanon ke mutabik, yah tufaan samandar main hi 17 june ko deep depressant banakar khatm ho jayega
 Gujarat may have been spared by cyclone 'vayu', but the way the storm changed direction again and again, it completely halted the monsoon
 mausam ke jaankaron ke mutabik, chakravaat ek bada wedar system hota he
 Whenever the cyclone forms in the Arabian Sea during the monsoon, it pulls the monsoon winds towards it and this reduces the speed of the monsoon
 iske ulat agar monsoon ke sijan main bengal kii khadi main koi chakravaat yaa deep depressant banataa he to monsoon kii barish main jabardast ijapha ho jaataa he, lekin is baar arab sagar main bane chakravaat ne monsoon kii haalat khasta kar di he

 agar puure vidarbha kshetra kii baat kii jaae to agast se ab tak 36 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 Government Medical College of Yavatmal has 24 people admitted, out of which 9 are reported to be critical
 aakhir mauton kaa ye silsilaa tham kyon nahin rahaa?yavatmal jile ke saverga gaanv main 52 varshiya gajanand namdev kaa naam bhi jile ke un 21 logon main shaamil he jinaki maut beete 3 maheene main kitnashkon ke adhik prabhaav main aane kii vajah se hui
 Gajanand breathed his last at Yavatmal Medical College on 1 October
 iske ek din pehle hi gajanand ne apane 3
 In a 5-acre field, cotton crop was sprayed with pesticides
 gajanand kii maut ke baad police ne kitnashkon ke khaali packeton or spray pump ko jabt kiya
 All these were purchased from a private agricultural center which is registered with the state government for selling pesticides
 police ne kaha ki ab is krishi centre ke maalik ke khilaaf karrwai hogi
 Police say Gajanand died of negligence
 maut kaa maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 But the fact is that even the police do not know much about the real cause of the deaths
 yavatmal medical college ke kaaryakari dean dow manish shrigrivar kaa kahana he ki kisaanon kii mautein jahrile rasayanon ke ghaatak mishran kii vajah se ho rahi he
 Pesticides are made of various compounds
 hamaare paas kuch ke liye antidots (pratirohak dawaaen) hai lekin kuch kaa ilaaj lakshanon ke aadhaar par hi hota he
 The problem occurs when a mixture of toxic chemicals reaches the inside of the farmers' body through their breath
 ham kisaanon ko salaah de rahe hai ki mishran kii jagah sirf ek hi tarah ke kitnashak kaa istemaal karen, wo bhi saavdhaanee ke sabhi upayon ke saath
 The health department is issuing the necessary guidelines but farmers are desperate to go to any length to protect their crop from pests
 12 acre ke khet main kapaas ugane vaale kisaan anand raav kaa kahana he ki fasal ko jis tarah ke kiton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, aisa beete 15 varsh main kabhi nahin dekha
 That is why farmers are using various types of pesticides to save their crops
 sirf nai tarah ke keet hi nahin balki kapaas fasal kaa aakaar bhi kisaanon ke liye samasya bana hua he
 The height of the crop is going more than 6 feet
 is vajah se kitnashkon kaa bhi adhik maatra main istemaal karnaa pad rahaa he
 Farmer Harsha Rao says that more guilty than pumps is the height of the crop, which is being seen for the first time

 baharhaal, ye nishchit he ki kitnashkon ke prabhaav main adhik der tak rahane kii vajah se vidarbha main kisaanon kii mautein hui hai
 But here is the big question why the issue of high impact of pesticides came up for the first time

 i leave you but i will not be able to wait
 mujhe aage janaa hoga
 i thanked him and i sat down (otherwise i could not reach the namaz)
 ) As soon as i reached the mosque, they did something that i did not even expect
 unhone apni pocket se paise nikaale or mujhe dene lage taaki main namaaz ke baad daftar ja sakuun
 He could not wait for me, but he wanted to make sure that i reached the office properly
 vah bade hi pyaar se mujhe kah rahe the ki main sharminda mahasoos na karun

 'ek or kadam aage badi priyanka, nik jonas ke papa se bhi kii dostiysha choudhary ek prerak vaktaa thim, jinhen 13 saal kii umr main pulmonary fibrosis naamak beemaari ho gai thi, lekin isse unke utsaah main kami nahin ai

 In Varanasi, there is no praise for the kind of hymn that the BJP candidate Narendra Modi did not get permission to rally
 yah mahaj prashasnic faisla tha jiskaa jamkar raajnneetikaran kiya gaya
 Steps like dharna-satyagraha were also taken
 iske saath hi jabardast bayaanbaji bhi kii gai
 All the BJP leaders started criticizing in unison
 loktantr main yah sab jaij he lekin yah sab shaleenta or sadbhaav ke daayre se baahar hai or inaki koi jarurat nahin thi
 Even a statement could work
 lekin shaayad bijepi ke netaa is bahaane shakti pradarshan karnaa chaahate the
 He also did this
 lekin isse shaayad hi unhen kuch mila hoga
 Such extreme and sentimental steps spoil the atmosphere
 varanasi ek vishisht dharmik nagar he or yahaan kaa vaataavaran kabhi bhi tanaav purna nahin hota, aise main is karah ke kadamon se kya sandesh gaya?jepi ke netaaon ne isse aakhir kya sabit kiya?is tarah ke kadamon se kya party ke piem candidet narendra modi kii chhavi par asar nahin padataa?agar party unhen pradhan mantri ke pad par dekhnaa chaahati he to abhi se unki chhavi banane kii bajaay use dhoomil karne kaa prayaas kyon kar rahi he?narendra modi kaa kad kaaphi bada he or vah desh ke sabase bade raajnneetik netaaon kii suchi main shumaar ho chuke hai to phir is tarah kii kavayad kii kya jarurat he?aisa lagata he ki party kahin na kahin se bhramit he
 After all there is a difference between democracy and democracy
 ab jabaki chunaav kaa lanbaa daur samaapti kii ore he, is tarah ke vivaadon or anaavashyak hath se kuch nahin milegaa
 Now there is a need for social harmony, which was not seen in this election
 chunaav to khatm ho jaaenge lekin bigadaa hua maahaul thik hone main maheenon yaa shaayad varshon lag jaaen
 Therefore it is important that instead of taking such emotional steps, the party should work to create an atmosphere
 agar usne chunaav jeeta to yah unke hi kaam aayega
 It is easy to spoil something, it takes a lot of time to build, especially human relationships
 pramotion, paisa or publicity
 
 
 To achieve these three, if not all of Uttar Pradesh, some police officers also seem ready to take the path of fake encounters as a short cut
 india today kii special invastigeshan team (SIT) ne apni jaanch ke dauraan paaya ki yogi sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan muthbhedon main marane waalon kaa aankada 60 se upar pahunch gaya he
 According to official figures, around 400 people have been injured in around 1500 encounters conducted by the Uttar Pradesh police since March 2017
 india today kii special investigation team kii jaanch se saamne aayaa ki upi police ke kuch sadsy jhuthe maamalon main nirdosh nagarikon ko fansaa rahe hai or phir unhen farji muthbhedon main shoot kar rahe hai
 All this is being done with the intention of promoting and taking the money from others to hide someone
 upi main bijepi ke satta main aane ke baad se sirf agra zone main 241 muthbhed hui hai
 a sub-inspector of the local Chitrahat police station charged Rs eight lakh for killing an innocent civilian
 india today ke under cover reporters ne jaanch ke tahat khud ko kaarobaari bataate hue apane ek kaalpanik pratispardhi ko farji maamle main fansaane ke liye sab inspector se sampark kiya
 Sub Inspector Sarvesh Kumar told the Under Cover Reporters, 'the way you have a problem, there is only one way to solve it
 baichance mere paas do teen bank hai
 
 
 Any incident occurs anywhere
 
 
 to main use apane aap involve kar luungaa
 'sarvesh Kumar further said,' And in this involve we can do it to a great extent
 
 
 jaise wo injurd (ghayal) bhi ho saktaa he
 
 
 He can also lose his life
 
 
 ’sab inspector ne apana plan bhi bataaya : ‘kaalpanik vyakti ke khilaaf bank dakaiti kaa farji saboot jutaya jayega, phir use agyaat sandigdhon main namjad kiya jayega
 This will be followed by a so-called encounter
 usamen ab jaan bhi ja sakati he, injurd (ghayal) bhi ho saktaa he
 'sarvesh Kumar claimed-' They are robbed
 ye mere kshetra main ho gai, jaitpur main ho gai yaa bah main ho gai
 i am talking about myself
 teen thanon kii jimmedaari meri
 i can set ’under cover reporter- ‘acha jo bank lut hogi usamen wo ladkaa to nahin hoga
 If 'sarvesh Kumar-' will not be there, but will not have to bring it
 
 
 agyaat sandigdhon main namjad kiya jayega
 This is the work of the police
 
 
 uske paas koi idi hogi
 
 
 ID will come
 us idi pruf ko ham ghatnasthal se baraamad kara denge
 'reporter- OK
 sarvesh kumaar ne aage kaha,‘uski jaan bhi ja sakati he yaa ghayal ho saktaa he
 In my case (police station area), the price will be Rs 5-6 lakh
 duusare aria main dusron se bhi baat kerani hogi
 There may be upwards of two lakhs
 isse zyada nahin
 Sarvesh Kumar said with a guarantee that the target (imaginary person) will be blown up in the mutt, that is, he will not be allowed to escape
 sarvesh kumaar ne kaha, ‘bachane kaa koi chance hi nahin hota he
 What is the chance of the man i have kept in the target? ' Sarvesh Kumar claimed, 'nothing is written and arrested in arresting
 arest to hota he, lekin likhit main arest nahin hota he
 When shooting in the open, there is no chance of survival
 ’india today kii jaanch se jo saamne aayaa, uskaa ye matlab nahin he ki yogi sarkaar ke tahat jitani bhi police muthabheden ho rahi hai wo sab farji hai
 But what Sarvesh Kumar said indicates that some of the encounters may have been carried out in a fake manner against the detained suspects
 sarvesh kumaar ne daawa kiya,‘ye baat to sahi he ki wo (target) duusari jagah se laae jate hai
 'under cover reporter-' means being caught and killed
 ’sarvesh kumaar- ‘chahen ham apane aap se lekar aaen
 
 
 Whether through any medium
 kisi (target) ko laalach dekar mulaakaat ke liye tay sthaan par bulaayaa jaataa he
 Our men are there
 
 
 ho gaya
 'UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanathlagar has been dismissive of allegations that the state police is implicating innocent people
 yogi adityanath ne may main india today se kaha tha,‘police yaa prashasan nirdosh vyakti ko nahin martha
 They cannot do this
 lekin agar koi police par goli chalaaegaa to police aatmaraksha main goli chalaa sakati he
 Yogi Adityanath said, 'what i can say is that my government will not discriminate anyone on the basis of caste, religion or gender
 har naagarik ko suraksha kii guarantee hogi or har naagarik ko vikaas ke liye avasar pradaan karaae jaaenge
 'but the reality is that it can be frightening in some cases
 agra jile ke pados main hi basai jaganer police stesan ke stesan officer jagadamba singh ne mana ki pramotion (tarakkee) kaa laalach rajya main police adhikariyon se farji muthbhed tak karvaa detaa he
 The SO claimed, 'one is prepared to do anything to take charge of SO
 hatya kar de, paise se khaid le, is pad ke liye kuch bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Jagdamba Singh claimed that extra judicial killings and misuse of power were common in Uttar Pradesh
 jagadamba singh ne kaha, ‘aaj kii date main media itnaa haaavee he to bhi encounter ho rahe hai
 There is no other police in India more powerful than up's police
 ’jagadamba singh ne shekhi badhaarte kaha ki ‘kabul ke ghodon kii tarah ham sabase badhiya hai
 Our arms and legs are tied
 munh dhakaa he, phir bhi ham kaat lete hai, laat maarthe hai, maar dete hai
 Please do whatever you want
 ham bharat kii sabase taqatvar police hai
 Jagdamba Singh dismissed such official claims of his department that every encounter happens suddenly on the spot
 jagadamba singh ke daawey ke mutabik jile ke police pramukh yani esaspi ko kuch maamalon main sambhavit encounter ke bare main jaankaree ho sakati he
 Jagdamba Singh said, who will participate in the encounter? Constable, Inspector, Inspector
 
 They are here only
 lekin bina captain (esaspi) kii sahmati ke kuch nahin hota
 In the Basai Jagner police station, the under-cover reporter talked to sub-inspector Balbir Singh, and the transfer of Balbir to Agra City was shown to be futile
 balbir singh ne kaha, city main chaowkee mili to thik he varanaa kya phayda he
 Suppose a posting was done at the police station
 inspector ne uthaakar kisi chaowkee par kar diya
 Now Outpost Incharge is second
 vahi sara paisa (ghoose) le jayega
 He will take whatever decision is taken about everything
 balbir singh ne shahari kshetra main posting hone kii sthiti main farji encounter tak karne ke liye khud ko taiyaar bataaya
 Balbir Singh said, 'I will come to the city and then see the encounter
 use (target) ko shahar main pakadaa jayega
 It can be arranged
 ’under cover reporter- to kya use (target) pakad kar maarna hi he?balbir singh- ‘haa, lekin pakadaney ke baad hi to yojana banaai jaati he
 Will be kept confidential
 koi jaan bhi nahin paaegaa
 This is how these works are done
 ’balbir singh ne andercover reporters ko hatyaon ke liye bhaade ke hatyaron se sampark karne kii bhi salaah di
 Balbir Singh said, 'if you want to do (murder), then you can meet professional shooters
 tamaam aise shooters uplabdh hai

 While the BJP may have described itself as the largest political party in the world, this party has received a donation of Rs 1,034 crore in the same financial year, but surprisingly the party has not had a treasurer for the last few years
 kisi jamaane main seetaram kesari kecongresskoshadhyaksh pad par rahete ek jumala bahut sunne ko miltaa tha, 'naa khaataa, naa bahi, jo kesari kahen vahi sahi,' lekin aaj kii bijepi kii baat karen to kya wo bina koshadhyaksh hi apana kaam chalaane main sakasham he?shah ne nahin chunaa koshadhyakshadrasal, 2014 main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii aguai main centre main endie sarkaar bani to grih mantri ke taur par rajnath singh ne jimmaa sambhala
 Prior to this, Rajnath Singh was the national president of BJP

 While Rajnath's party president, the responsibility of the treasurer of the BJP was on the shoulders of Piyush Goyal

 Amit Shahki, who is considered a special lieutenant of Modi in place of Rajnath Singh, was crowned as the national president of BJP

 However, he kept the post of treasurer vacant
 amit shah ek baar phir se janvari 2016 main party ke adhyaksh bane lekin is baar unhone apni nai team nahin banaai
 Although he did fill some vacant posts in the organization, the post of treasurer remained vacant
 pichley saal 81 fisadi kaa izafabijepi ne vitt varsh 2016-17 ke liechunaavayog main audit report ke jariye 1,034 karod rupye chanda milane kii jaankaree di
 The BJP became the richest party in the country with such a huge donation in a year
 beete saal kii tulana main is saal bijepi ke chande main 81 fisadi kii vruddhi hui
 The audit report submitted by the BJP to the Election Commission for the financial year 2016-17 is signed by 'for' in place of the treasurer, the party's general secretary Ramlal and chartered accountant Veni Thapar
 hairaani kii baat he jis party ko ek saal main hi 1,034 karod rupee kii aamadani ho rahi ho, uske liye koshadhyaksh ke bina fund koun ikattha kar rahaa he? chunaav ayog pichley teen saal se bijepi kii audit report ko kaise sweekaar kar rahaa he?chunaav ayog maang saktaa he reportis vishay par purv mukhya chunaav ayukta es vaai kuraishi se 'ajtak' ne baat kii
 He had to say on this subject that the audit report is an important document and hence it should be signed by a responsible party official
 kuraishi ke mutabik chunaav ayog sambandhit party se us vyakti kii vistrut jaankaree maang saktaa he jisane audit report ko daakhil kiya or pramanit kiya ho
 If the Election Commission finds something wrong then it can also take action against the party concerned
 vahiin, bijepi pravaktaashahanvaj hussainne kaha ki jis netaa ko party adhyaksh adhikrut karte hai usee netaa ke audit report par hastakshar hote hai
 These signatures are from the party itself
 shahanvaj ne daawa kiya ki bijepi niyam se chalane vaali party he or uskaa record saaf suthra he
 According to Shahnawaz, the transparency the BJP exerts will not be seen anywhere else
 unhone kaha ki ham chanda lete hai to raseed dete hai, ham aaajeevan sahyog nidhi se party chalaate hai
 On the allegations of opposition, Shahnawaz said what difference does the opposition make
 baharhaal, amit shah ke adhyaksh pad par rahete bijepi kaa chunaav dar chunaav graph ooncha hua he balki akut chanda milane se party kaa khajaana bhi bada he
 Now this big question is definitely whether the party does not even need a treasurer to keep such a large account of donations

 According to market sources, the persistent selling by stockists due to weak demand at current levels and weak global trend as the dollar strengthened led to a decline in demand for precious metals

 'dhoni helicopter chikan' ke saath 'kadak kohli chaay' Film Name: Main Aur Charles Director: Praval Ramanstar Cast: Randeep Hooda, Richa Chadha, Adil Hussain Duration: 123 minutescertification: a Rating: 2
 5 stardiarector pravaal raman or abhinayta randeep hooda ke bich ek kaaman factor 'ramgopal verma' hai
 Coral and Randeep worked together under Ram Gopal Varma
 phir baad main pravaal ne 'darana manaa he' 'darana jaruri he' or '404' jaisi filmein banaain
 The film 'I and Charles' is based on parts of the life of the now infamous criminal 'charles Sobhraj'
 yah film 80 ke dashak main police kamishnar rahe amod kaant ke dwaara sunai gai jise parde par pravaal ne utaara he
 Coral has also made several promotional videos for Amod Kant's philanthropist 'prayas'
 ab kya yah film darshakon kaa manoranjan kar paane main safal rahegi? aaiye film kii samiksha karte hai
 Kahani This is the story of '80s Bikini Killer' Charles (randeep Hooda), who cheats people and also kills girls
 bharat kii mashhoor jelon main se ek 'tihaad jail' se bhi wo pulisavaalon ko dhokhaa dekar bhaag jane main safal hua or aakhir main pakadaa jaataa he
 Between police commissioner Amod Kant (adil Hussain) and Charles, the thief policeman walks
 saath hi kabhi mira (richa chaddha) to kabhi anya kalakaar bhi charles kii yatra ke chashmadid banate hai
 Along with the script's story being based on real life, there has been an attempt to create a little fantasy
 jisase darshakon tak flavor sahi jaae
 The coral has made a fine film by giving the story as a script, heard from Amod Kant
 film kaa screenple kaaphi dhilaa he jise or bhi crisp kiya ja saktaa tha
 Seeing the trailer, it seemed that the dialogues of the film would be great but nothing happened and the dialogues were dull
 concept ke lihaaj se film or bhi behatar banaai ja sakati thi
 It is a very slow film but shooting locales such as Thailand, Goa and Delhi have been shown by coral in good style
 abhinalbhinayta randeep hoodaki acting ke saath-saath bolne ke tareeke kii daad deni hogi
 The way he has played Charles's biggest habit on the screen by mixing with people and becoming like him
 saath hi adil hossain kaa kirdaar bhi kaaphi sahaj he
 Which seems to be an equal match with Charles
 richa chaddha, tiska chopra or baaki kalakaaron ne saraahneey kaam kiya he
 The music of the music film has been kept from the 60s-70s but the song 'jab Chhaye Mera Jadoo' is the best
 kamjor kadifilm kii kamjor kadi isaki gati or script he, jo ki or bhi zyada crisp ho sakati thi
 Because of this, despite being a good artist, the film could not do well
 kyon dekhenrandeep hooda ke diwane hai to yah film jarur dekhen

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh has suffered a major accident due to the fall of a part of the under-construction flyover
 ab tak mili jaankaree ke anusaar, 15 logon kii maut ho chuki he or badi sankhya main log ghayal hue hai
 But in the midst of all this a shocking thing has come to light
 jaankaree ke mutabik, is nirmaanadhin fliover ke dizin ko lekar shuru se sawaal uthte rahe hai
 The flyover project was approved on 2 March 2015
 is 1710 meter lambey fliover ke liye 77 karod 41 lakh rupee kaa bajet paas kiya gaya tha
 The construction of this flyover started on October 25, 2015
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is fliover kaa nirmaan kaaphi arase se chal rahaa tha
 Recently Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had ordered to complete the construction of this flyover as soon as possible during his visit to Varanasi
 fliover ke nirmaan kaa adhiktar kaam puraa ho chukaa he or ab aakhri charan kaa kaam chal rahaa tha
 But meanwhile, after talking to the local people, it was found that there were many irregularities in the construction of the flyover
 hadabadi main ho rahaa kamek sthaneey vyakti ne shikayati lahaze main kaha ki har kaam ko jaldi-jaldi hadabadi main kiya ja rahaa he
 The pillars that are being installed are not being interlinked
 agar jodate hue nirmaan kaary aage badhata to yah ghatana nahin hoti
 Last year itself, questions were raised about the design, it is being said that questions were raised about the design of this under-construction bridge in July 2017 itself
 aisa kaha gaya ki fliover kii dizin aisi bana di gai he, jo baari vaahanon ke liye musiibat ban gai he
 When the construction of this flyover started near the roadways bus station located near Cantt railway station, the slabs on the pillar were shaken by a heavy vehicle collision
 afasaron ne kii khami chhipaani kii koshishvahan kii takkar se hill gaye in pilrs ko thik karne kaa sthaayee nidaan afasaron ko sujh nahin rahaa tha
 Then the officers of UP State Setu Nigam had barred the entry of heavy vehicles by putting a barrier to hide this flaw
 vastav main shuruyaat main lage chaar slab baari vaahanon se takaraane ke chalate hilne lage the
 It was being feared that it was also being feared that when the road below the flyover was built, its height would increase
 aise main fliover ke neeche se baari vaahan ke guzarane par slab ke phir se kshatigrast hone kii ashanka jataai ja rahi thi
 The period of completion of the construction work has been reduced
 It is being said that the period for completion of the construction of this flyover was earlier scheduled for December, 2018
 lekin baad main ise ghataakar march, 2018 kar diya gaya
 But once again the duration of its construction was extended

 With the scorching heat outside, as soon as you enter inside the temple, you will feel ac-like cooling, whereas there is no AC or cooler installed here
 baahar jitani garmi hoti he andar utana thanda rahata he
 This miraculous temple has the idol of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati
 aisa mana jaataa he ki in murtiyon se hi thandi hawa aati he, jo yahaan ke vaataavaran ko garm nahin rahane detii he
 When the doors of the temple are closed, these winds cause a lot of cold inside
 kai baar yahaan itani thand bad jaati he ki pujaariyon ko kambal odhana padataa he vahiin mandir ke baahar itani garmi hoti he ki 5 minute main aap paseene se puri tarah tar ho jaaen or ho saktaa he ki lu lag jaae
 No one is yet to know the exact reason behind the mystery of the coolness in this temple even in summer

 bhartiya rigerv bank 1 lakh 76 hajaar 51 karod rupee bharat sarkaar ko degaa
 The money belongs to the Reserve Bank's contingency fund and surplus, which is called a contingency fund in English
 1949 main bhartiya reserve bank apane maujuuda swaroop main aata he, or tab se lekar aaj tak uske itihaas main itnaa paisa kabhi rigerv bank se bharat sarkaar ko nahin gaya he
 The money was taken from the Reserve Bank's contingency fund during the war with China, but why is this money being said that it is the first time in the history of RBI when it is required to withdraw so much money from the contingency fund to the government It has been decided
 vaise bhi is saal ke bajet main ummid jataai gai thi ki reserve bank 90,000 hazaar karod rupaya milegaa, lekin usase bhi 86000 karod adhik rupaya aane vaala he
 That means more than what the government asked for
 is sadi kaa hisaab dekhte hai
 20,000 crore on average between 2004 and 2014
 2015 se 2019 ke bich ausatan 54,000 karod die gaye
 2019-20 i
e
 1,76,000 crores will be given in this one financial year alone
 1991 main chandrashekhar jab pradhanmantri the tab videshi mudra kaa sankat aayaa tha
 India had only 15 days of money to import, then 47 tonnes of gold kept with the Reserve Bank of India was pledged with the Bank of England
 kya ham us sthiti se tulana kar sakate hai, iskaa thos jawaab mere paas nahin he
 Is there a different situation today that needs to be understood then we can try
 bhartiya reserve bank jo paisa degaa wo apane do khaaton se degaa
 1,23,414 crore will be given from the Contingency Fund
 52,637 karod rupaya adhishesh yani sarplus fund se diya jayega
 The Bimal Jalan Committee made some suggestions a week in advance and soon all the suggestions were accepted
 bhartiya reserve bank ke kendriya board ne paune do lakh karod rupaya hastantarit karne kaa faisla le liya
 In December 2018, a committee was formed under the leadership of Bimal Jalan, a member of which Subhash Chand Garg disagreed and refused to sign
 garg ko duusare mantralay main bhej diya gaya or unki jagah vitt sachiv rajeev kumaar nae sadsy ke rup main aa gaye or uske baad cameti ke faisle par sabane sahmati zaahir kar di
 The Reserve Bank of India has issued a lengthy press release
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki bhartiya reserve bank ne is faisle par pahunchane se pehle duniya bhar ke rigerv bank ke jokhim kaa adhyayan kiya gaya
 It was also seen how much money should be kept in the Reserve Bank and then it was decided
 reserve bank do tarah kii paristhiti ke liye paisa bachaakar rakhata he
 At the time of monetary crisis and second at the time of financial crisis
 donon sankaton kii paribhaasha alag-alag he
 The Bimal Jalan Committee has stated how much the contingency fund should be
 reserve bank ke balance shit kaa 6
 5 to 5 5 pratishat ke range main rakhi ja sakati he
 The Reserve Bank accepted the Nutanam range for itself
 adhiktam ko nahin
 The Reserve Bank's Contingency Fund 6 before this committee
 8 pratishat hua karti thi
 According to the balance sheet, the percentage of reserves has been going down
 kya jalaan cameti ne nunatam range dekar rigerv bank kii madad kar di
 Former Chief Statistics Officer of India Pranab Sen says that due to the minimum range, there is no scope left with the Reserve Bank
 aane vaali sarkarein yaa yahi sarkaar aane vaale samay main nunatam range par hi jor detii rahegi
 You know that the Reserve Bank has had to go through several rounds of opposition before reaching this conclusion
 governor urjit patel ne rigerv paisa dene se manaa kar diya or samay se pehle apana pad chhodkar chale gaye
 for personal reasons
 november 2018 main indian express ke sanni verma kii khabar thi ki reserve bank ne sarkaar ko 3 lakh 60,000 karod dene se manaa kar diya he
 At that time, the question was raised that the government was attacking the autonomy of the Reserve Bank, then the government had said that the current rules are based on orthodox thinking
 sarkaar or reserve bank ko milakar rasta nikaalnaa chahie ki 9
 How to use surplus of 56 lakh crores
 is soch kaa sabase mukhar virodh dipti governor viral acharya ne kiya tha
 He later resigned from his post
 aktubar 2018 main viral acharya ne kaha tha ki argentina kii sarkaar bhi reserve bank ke khazaane ko hathiyanna chaahati thi
 The governor resigned in protest and there was catastrophe
 sarkaar jo yojana bana rahi he vah tii-20 match kii tarah he, lekin rigerv bank bahut aage kii soch kar yojana banaata he
 Following the statement of Viral Acharya, former Governor Raghuram Rajan told CNBC channel anchor Lata Venkatesh that the government should not try to lay hands on the Reserve Bank, it is not good for the economy
 agar aap apana reserve sarkaar ko de denge to bharat kii reating neeche aa jaati he
 Why can't we save this reserve? raghuram rajan kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko atirikt labhaansh dene ke liye rigerv bank ko atirikt sthaayee rigerv kaa srijan karnaa hoga jaise or adhik note chhapane honge
 That is, you have to bring as much as you give
 unhone kaha tha ki har saal ham is baat kaa khyaal rakhte hai ki sthaayee rigerv main kitni vruddhi ho rahi he, arthvyavastha main kitni nagdi kii zarurat he or mudrasphiti kaa lakshya kya he, lekin purv governor di subbarao kaa tark tha ki kendriya bank apni ashankaon ko kuch zyaada hi badhachadha kar dekhne lag jate hai
 The government and the Reserve Bank can jointly find a way out
 purv mukhya aarthik salaahkaar arvind subramanyam ne aarthik survey main kaha tha ki koi khaas kaaran nazar nahin aata ki reserve bank kyon nahin apana sarplus sarkaar ko de
 At the current level, the Reserve Bank has considerable capital
 duniya main adhik puunji vaale bank main se ek he
 If the Reserve Bank returns 4 lakh crores, it can be used in many ways
 yahaan par ham aapako ek baat kii yaad dilaanaa chaahate hai

 usamen bataaya ki aarthik survey main sarkaar ne jitani vaastavik kamai bataai thi or bajet main jo anumaan bataaya tha donon main kaaphi antar tha
 17 in the 2018-19 budget
 3 lakh karod kii kamai kaa anumaan bataaya gaya tha
 In the economic survey, the government earned 15
 6 lakh karod dikhaai thi
 Ie 1
 70 lakh karod kaa hisaab kahaan gaya
 This question was raised by Rathin Roy, a member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council
 is antar ko lekar kai halkon main chintaa jataai gai thi
 Will the money from the Reserve Bank make up for it? He knows where the government will use this money
 kya vah vittiya ghate kii bharpai karne main karegi yaa anya madon main
 Himanshu Shekhar spoke to former Reserve Bank Director Vipin Malik
 unka kahana he ki is paisa kaa istemaal puunji nivesh main kare
 To strengthen banks so that they can give maximum loan
 vipaksh ko yah raas nahin aayaa
 The opposition says that the Reserve Bank's autonomy is an attack, but this step shows that India's economic situation is very bad
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki pradhanmantri or vitt mantri ko samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki jo aarthik traasadee khud paidaa kii he uskaa hal kaise nikaale
 Taking money from the Reserve Bank will not work, it is like stealing a Band Aid from the dispensary on a bullet wound
 iskaa jawaab vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne diya ki janata ne unke chor vaali baat kaa sateek jawaab de diya he
 They do not care
 vitt mantri ne kaha he ki abhi nahin bataa sakati ki reserve bank se mili paise kaa istemaal kaise hoga? 2013 tak reserve bank jitna sarplus kamata tha, uskaa kuch pratishat aakasmik nidhi main jamaa kiya jaataa tha
 Between 2010 and 2013, between 32 and 45 percent was deposited, but after 2013 the entire surplus was given to the government
 aakasmik nidhi main nahin jamaa hua
 The deposit started again from 2016-2017, but now only 6 to 7 percent of the surplus is being deposited in the Emergency Fund

 team india ke kuch senior khiladiyon ke bich matbhed kii baat saamne aane ke baad ab team ke media manager ne kaha he ki sabhi khilaadi ekajute hai
 The media manager said that everything is fine in Team India
 unhone kaha ki pichhali haar ke baad team ke khiladiyon ne aapas main baat kii
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhonito did not appear before the media, but Irfan Pathan said that we have come here to win
 isse pehle bhartiya cricket niyantran board (bisisiai) captain mahendra singh dhoni or up captain virendra sahvaag ke bich kathith manmutav kii baton ko lekar guuruuvaar ko bich-bachaav main utar aayaa
 The board asked Dhoni and Sehwag on a tour of Australia to forget their differences and restore peace in the team
 bisisiai se jude sutron ne bataaya ki board ke sachiv sanjay jagadale ne guuruuvaar ko dhoni or sahvaag donon se baat kii or unase aapasi matbhed sheeghra dur karne ke liye kaha tha
 Significantly, Kimhendra Singh Dhoni's statement that Kischin Tendulkar, Sehwag and Gautam are seriously sluggish fielders, keeping in mind the team management has started the rotation system, gave rise to controversy
 dhoni ne yah bhi kaha tha ki in khilaadiyon kii vajah se ekadivasiy maichon main 20 ran zyada dene padate hai
 At the same time, at a press conference, Sehwag had said that the captain never told the senior players that they are dull fielders
 team india ke purv captain or wicketiper ballebaaj mahendra singh dhoni ne tii-20 team main apni jagah ko lekar kii gai aalochanaon kaa jabaav diya he
 During the launch of his cricket academy in Dubai, Dhoni spoke on the statements made by other former cricketers including Ajit Agarkar and VVS Laxman
 khalij times ko die gaye intervyuu main dhoni ne kaha ki 'sabhi ke apane-apane vichaar hote hai or unka sammaan karnaa chahie
 Everyone has the right to speak
 team india kaa hissaa hona hi mere liye sabase badi prerana he
 Dhoni said that not everyone gets a chance to play for the country
 aapane aise kai cricketrs dekhen honge, jinamein koi khaas tallent nahin tha, lekin phir bhi ve kaaphi aage gaye
 This has happened due to a passion for the game
 'dhoni ne kaha, ‘maine hameshaa hi mana he ki nateezon se ahm prakriya hoti he
 i never thought about the result, i always thought what would be right to do at that time, even if 10 runs are needed, 14 runs are required or five runs are needed
 ’ main is prakriya main hi itnaa shaamil rahaa or maine kabhi bhi is baat kaa boj nahin liya ki tab kya hoga, agar nattejey mere hisaab se nahin rahe
 Dhoni said, "you can play for 1 to 15 years, some people play for 20 years, but in your entire life where if you live for 70 years there are nothing 10 to 15 years and this is the only time when you Can proudly say that i am representing my country
 sabase badi prerana he bhartiya cricket team kaa hissaa hona
 If Dhoni and Laxman had commented on Dhoni, let us tell you that after the defeat of Team India in the second T20 match against New Zealand in Rajkot, Mahendra Singh Dhoni had taken the target of many former cricketers and said to find his option
 ajit agarkar ne kaha tha ki bhartiya team management ko tii-20 main dhoni kaa vikalp sochane kii jarurat he
 VVS Laxman had said about Dhoni that, 'dhoni comes at number 4 in T20 matches
 unhen set hone main zyada vakt lagata he or uske baad ve apni jimmedaari nibhaate hai
 In the Rajkot match, when Virat Kohli's strike rate was close to 160, Dhoni's strike rate was around 80
 bhartiya team jab bade score kaa peechha kar rahi thi tab yah kaaphi nahin tha
 Laxman had said, "I think the time has come for Dhoni to free up space for a young player in the T20 format
" camentator akaash chopra ne kaha tha ki srilanka ke khilaaf hone valiti-20 sirisse dhoni kii jagah kisi anya khilaadi ko chunaa janaa chahie, kyonki bharat ko dakshin africa ke chunauteepurn daure par janaa he
 Shastri and Kohli had defended Team India head coach Ravi Shastri, while giving a befitting reply to Dhoni's critics, saying that some bad guys want to see his career come to an end
 unhone kaha, 'aisa lag rahaa he ki unke aas-paas unase jalane vaale kai log hai, jo unke kariyar main bure din dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Shastri had said, "the Indian team knows how capable Dhoni is and any criticism against such a player has no effect on the team
" aalochana se mujhe koi fark nahin padataa
 We know what Dhoni has in mind
 vah ek behtareen khilaadi hai

 isse aap apane sikh hue hunar kaa istemaal rosemara ke kaam main karte hai
 'REL makes easy kits to make science easy and fun for children
 kit main plastic bottle, kaagaj, dhaage, vagairah saamaanya gharelu cheez hoti hai
 People engaged in the field of education are devising new ways to make education easy across the country and use experimental kits, puppets and music, etc
 apane aap karoshiksha ke kshetra se jude log is par kaaphi jor dete hai ki bachche khud nae-nae prayog karen or chizon ko seekhen
 For example, there is a center at Butter Fly Fields in Hyderabad called 'innovation Space' for children
 yahaan bachche science ke vibhinn experiments kit ko khud aajamaate hai or dekhakar sikhte hai
 The 35-year-old, founder of Butterfly Fields and an IIT graduate

 It has different materials for every class with different colors according to age, animals have logos and the blackboard is in the eyes of the students
 mathematics main thri-diamensional material or tarah-tarah ke card istemaal kiye jate hai
 Unlike other education-based apps and technology-based gazettes, these materials are meant for the common man and for government and private schools, cities and villages
 butter fli fields ke kit kaa asar pichley saat saal main 4,500 skulon or 10 rajyon ke bich chah lakh students tak hua he
 Children from poor families in Ahmedabad are learning science with rel's cheap kit

 People of the field of work and sports education now believe that sports and education should go hand in hand
 isi se ve paath or tarah-tarah ke siddhanton ko bataane ke liye kathputliyon vagairah kaa istemaal karte hai
 The classroom, headquartered in Vadodara, is a creative audio-visual program aimed at helping traditional learning in schools

 To make it playful, it includes puppet dancing, songs, experiments, sports, kissing, drama, etc
 inamen sabhi vishyon english, hindi, mathematics or paryaavaran vagairah ke paath hai
 Thakore says, 'methods of learning connect children, generate interest in them and also train local teachers
 ' padhai ko mjedaar banane ke vichaar kii prerana se theatre group kalsutri hawa, ganit or jindagi kii buniyadi samaj ke siddhanton ko samajhane ke liye haath ke bane putale banaata he

 'he recently created a character vitamin-c and showed him interacting with children on the benefits of vitamins
 bacchon ke counslar bhi shiksha main audio-vijual samagriyon or putalon, vagairah ke laabh par baat karte hai
 Vimla Jain, a 42-year-old psychologist based in Mumbai, says, "students tend to understand puppets more than teachers
 yah khule samvaad or padhai kaa acha tarika he
 According to Sharat Chandra of Butterfly Fields Continually Studying, the biggest advantage of these methods for students is that each child takes an active stake in themselves or as part of the team
 chandra kehete hai, 'yahubaau se dilachasp padhai kii ore kadamhai
 When a child learns in practical ways, then it becomes easy for him to understand every principle that is taught in class or books
 ' duusari ore, abl skulon main bacchon ke na aane, ladakiyon kii taadaad badhaane or zyada se zyada bacchon ko skool main laane kii samasyaon par bhi vichaar kar rahaa he
 These new methods break the traditional system and new materials are coming in from different types of materials, tools and ideas, so new ideas are coming in the new generation

 (input:bhashaa) In Australia, several organizations, including the Art of Living and Martial Arts Institute, are offering free classes to Indian students suffering from racial attacks to relieve mental stress and teach them self-defense tricks
 melbern sthit federation of indian students association ke amit menghani ke mutabik unke federation ko is tarah ke peediton kii madad ke liye do sansthaaon se muft main prashikshan dene kaa prastaav mila he
 He told, 'we are still working on how to organize the Art of Living and Martial Arts sessions
 'unhone bataaya ki art of living kii kakshaain peediton ke liye muft main hongi or yah yahaan sthit aaramarti vishvavidhyalay ke parisar main buudhvaar se shuru hogi
 Menghani said that we are also considering with the institutes whether such training can be given to all Indians in future in view of the stress situation of all Indian students
 menghani ne bataaya ki yah ummid kii ja rahi he da art of living in chaatro ke pareshaan man ko shant karegaa
 Meanwhile the Institute of Martial Arts has proposed to organize classes to teach students self-defense tricks
 unhone bataaya ki yahaan bhartiya chaatro pah hue hinsak hamalon ke baad unke man main ek anjaanaa sa khauf samaa gaya he
 Significantly, Australia is currently facing pressure from New Delhi to prevent the attack on Indian students

 sweden kii solah varshiya greta thunberg or uski umr ke kuch or yuvaaon ne turki, argentina, brazil, germany or frans ke kilaaf to jalwaayu parivartan ke prati kaarywahi na karne ke vishay main muqadama darj kiya he, lekin america ke kilaaf nahin, jiskaa prati vyakti hanikaarak gas utsarjan duniya main adhiktam he
 These teenagers are also not prosecuting Sweden, whose per capita gas emissions are twice that of Brazil's per capita gas emissions
 vibhinn deshon kaa prati vyakti utsarjan vishwa kii jalwaayu main uske pradooshan yogadan ko dikhaata he
 America tops this list
 vahaan prati vyakti utsarjan taqariban sabhi viksit deshon se, jinamein germany or frans bhi shaamil he, do-gune se adhik he
 The gas emissions of every developed country in the world are three times higher than the developing countries of Asia (except China)
 africa vikasshil deshon ke prati vyakti utsarjan kii dar to vishwa ke baaqi anya deshon ke saamne kuch bhi nahin he
 If you compare, for example, a New Yorker with a woman living in a village in Brazil or Turkey, the per capita gas emissions difference will be much higher than the national average of these countries
 kehete hai ki agar har koi sweden waalon kii tarah rahane lage to hamen utsarjan kii samasya se nipatane ke liye 7 prithvi kii zaroorat hogi
 In this context, it makes no sense to target a developing country
 isi kaaran hi to varsho se vikasshil desh or viksit deshon main unke sahanubhutisheel saathi ne garibi or prati vyakti utsarjan ko jalwaayu sambandhit bahason ke centre main rakhane kii ladaai ladi he
 If you do not see per capita emissions, you hide the real cause of emissions which are lifestyle ("consumption" in technical parlance) and environmentally harmful ("unsustainable") methods of production
 agar aap prati vyakti utsarjan kii andekhi karte hai to aap 1970 ke pehle kaa vah naslwad or sujananawaad waapas le aate hai jo vikasshil deshon kii jansankhya or unki saamaajik-aarthik aakankshaon ko jalwaayu ke bigadane kaa kaaran tehraata he
 Every conversation on climate, development and population carries the seeds of racism and eugenicism
 prithvi ke simit sansadhano ke hisaab se jansankhya kitni honi chahie; yaa deshon ke bich audyogi utpaadan kaa vibhaajan kaise karnaa chahie, rashtriya yaa vaishvik str par yah sawaal karnaa hamen us khataranaak jagah ke kareeb le jaataa he jahaan ham logon ke bich aniatik bhedbhaav athwa unpar aloktantric paabandiyaan lagane ke bare main sochane lagate hai
 From Nazi concentration camps to forced adoption of aboriginal children and India's sterilization camps during the Emergency period, history is replete with examples where state-sponsored terrible programs are called public health, children's better future and population control But has been justified
 iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki hamen paryaavaran par baat nahin kerani chahie, lekin hamen pataa hona chahie ki vichaaron ke jis parivaar se paryaavaran kii baat aati he usamen ek jin paagalpan kaa bhi he or hamen un vichaaron ke prati chaukanna rahanaa chahie jinamein is jin ke hone kii sambhaavna ho
 Experts of climate debates are well aware of this route
 pichley 50 varshon main duniyabar main logon ne bahut lambi mehnat ke baad vah dhaancha viksit kiya he jisamen in muddon par naslwad, sujananawaad or rajya kii damankaaree kaarywahiyon main fanse bagaiyr baat kii ja sake
 This is the reason why the member states of the United Nations always emphasize that climate, development and population will not be seen separately, but in the broad boundary of poverty, personal health, economic development and civil liberties
 70 ke dashak se sanyukt raashtra main isi drushtikon par sahmati he
 Those wishing to know more about this subject can study the United Nations Bucharest Conference in 1974, the Cairo Conference Plan of Action in 1994 and the 2000 United Nations Millennium Development Goal (MDG / Millennium Goal)
 ye mahaj aitihaasik siddhant nahin he, haal hi main inhen sanyukt raashtra sangh ke 2015 ke satat vikaas lakshyon (esadiji / sasteneble dawalpment gol) main inhen phir se doharaaya gaya he
 Most importantly, there is a clear and agreed principle in all these agreements that the prevention of climate degradation will begin by developed countries
 vikasshil deshon ko svachh taknikiyon or paryaavaran samaadhaanon ko pradaan kiye jane kaa zimmaa bhi viksit deshon ne liya he
 These principles are also recorded in the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2016 Paris Agreement
 jalwaayu parivartan par kaam karne vaale “aam sahmati” kii baat karte hai
 This is the world's consensus on the environment
 yah paryaavaran or pragati kii dohari samasya par sampoorn or nishpaksh pratikriya par sahmati he
 This is a good consensus; Probably the only possible consensus for this limited and uneven Earth
 phir bhi aisa lag rahaa he ki greta thunberg, or usase bhi adhik mahatvapurn, unke peeche khadey log, jalwaayu ke liye hui is sahmati ko darkinar karne kii koshish main hai
 Perhaps this is the reason why they have filed cases against countries like Argentina, Turkey and Brazil, which are developing and dwarfed per capita emissions
 america ne jalwaayu parivartan paryaavarnavaad ko america vichaardhaara ke viruddh bataate hue kaarij kar diya he
 But the excuse for not prosecuting America is that it is not part of the United Nations Convention for the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
 akhir kyon aisi sthiti main thunberg ke sanchaalkon ne america par jalwaayu parivartan par sanyukt raashtra fremawork kanvension ke antargat muqadama nahin kiya, jisamen america bhi shaamil he? america ab tak keval paris samjhaute se baahar niklaa he, vyapak jalwaayu kanvension se nahin
 Here the real motive and understanding of those promoting Greta Thunberg comes under suspicion
 yah baat sahi he ki carbon footprint or jalwaayu parivartan ne vishwa kaa dhyaan aakarshith kiya he, lekin utsarjan or jalwaayu parivartan donon hi kaaran nahin hai balki sirf (aisa daawa kiya gaya he) paryaavarniya rup se arakshniya utpaadan or khapat ke parinaam hai
 But sustainable consumption and production are excluded from the UN climate discussions
 ise “satat upbhog or utpaadan ke kaaryakramon kaa fremwork” main rakh diya gaya he jo jalwaayu charchaaon kii tulana main kam prabhaavshaalee va nazar main kam aata he
 The Paris Agreement proclaims a grand vision: the global average temperature will be brought to a maximum of 2 ° c above the average pre-industrial temperature
 lekin uske paas is tak pahunchane ke liye kiye jane vaale vishesh kaamon kii koi suchi nahin he
 The Paris Agreement is basically limited to asking governments to voluntarily declare emissions reductions
 kisi jalwaayu samjhaute main upbhog or utpaadan par nishchit kaarywahi kaa na hona hawaabazi bhar he
 On the other hand, the Framework of Sustainable Consumption and Production has simply blackened the paper with indices of sustainable nature
 aasaan bhashaa main kaha jaae to deshon ne utpaadanon ke upbhog or utpaadan ke satat hone (yaa nahin hone) kaa paimaana tak tay nahin kiya he, jabaki vah carbon footprint ko ghataane kii badi baaten kar rahe hai
 After all, how can countries say to reduce emissions until they know how much carbon dioxide is dissolving in the atmosphere due to what they do
 satat upbhog or utpaadan ke fremawork main hui bahason se abhi tak sirf paryaavaran-paryaton or paryaavaran anukool bhawan nirmaan jaise naam-bhar ke halake prastaav baahar aaye hai
 This shows how serious the developed countries are towards protecting the environment
 paryaavaran kaa mudda uthaane waalon ko turki, brazil or argentina jaise vikasshil deshon par muqadama karne ke bajaay apana dhyaan yahaan lagaana chahie
 These countries not only have lower per capita emissions but they have agreed on the principle of environmentally friendly behavior much earlier than any developed country in their development cycle
 sanyukt raashtra kii greenhouse utsarjan suchi ke anusaar, turki kisi bhi viksit desh kii tulana main greenhouse utsarjan main sabase adhik kami laane vaala desh he
 Serious environmentalists should focus on the per capita carbon footprint and to draw some tangible results from the debates on sustainable consumption and production
 sweden ke kisi naagarik dwaara jalwaayu mudde par turki, brazil or argentina jaise desh par muqadama kiya janaa is tathy kii ghor or abhimaan bhari avhelnaa he ki viksit deshon dwaara hone vaali prati vyakti carbon utsarjan kii maatra vikasshil deshon se kahin bahut adhik he
 The misuse of the United Nations Children's Rights Agreement by Sweden's youth leading a life of convenience thus makes it even more tragic
 yah samjhauta garib or kamazor bacchon ko khaane, pahanane or aashray main madad dene ke liye hua tha
 The United Nations Children's Rights Agreement deals not with the "fairytales" of economic development, but with the problems of children who are facing the devastation of war and famine, who have been pushed into prostitution or hard labor due to terrible poverty
 main puri tarah un yuvaaon ke saath hum jo amuman amir deshon ke kishoron se adhik gambhir va jimmedaar nazar aate hai
 But big issues demand great attention
 kya greta thunberg bado kii baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai?
