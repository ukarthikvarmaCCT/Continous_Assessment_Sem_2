 ' driver ne kaha ki mujhe is baat kaa dar tha ki agar main bill nahin vasuul karuunga to company mere acount se 5 hajaar rupee kaat legi
 Later clarifying the incident, the Uber official said that it was a technical problem which was later rectified and we apologize for the trouble caused to the person who hired the cab

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched an election attack on Congress President Rahul Gandhi, saying that his contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Wayanad in Kerala is not a message to South India but it is a message of appeasement politics
 rajya main bhaajapa ke ummidavaaron ke samarthan ke liye yahaan ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne kaha ki vah jaananaa chaahate hai ki gandhi ne kerala main hi tiruvanantpuram yaa pathanmathitta seat se chunaav kyon nahin ladaa
 Gandhi is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Wayanad along with his traditional seat in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh
 iske bare main congress kaa kahana he ki vah dakshin bharat ke rajyon ko sandesh dena chaahate hai ki unke liye ve bhi utane hi moolyawaan hai or unka utana hi sammaan he
 The BJP is already vocal about Gandhi contesting from Wayanad
 bhaajapa kaa kahana he ki gandhi ko amethi se chunaav haarane kaa dar he isliye vah ek surakshit seat se chunaav lard rahe hai
 Modi alleged, "namdar of Congress says that he has come to Wayanad to give message to South India
" kya vah yah sandesh rajya kii rajdhani tiruvanantpuram yaa panthanmathitta se nahin de sakate the
 From here their message would have become even bigger
 yah dakshin bharat ke liye sandesh nahin he balki yah tushtikaran kii raajnneeti kaa sandesh he
 The bjp-led NDA coalition in Pathanamthitta and Thiruvananthapuram is pitted against the CPI (M) -led LDF and the Congress-led UDF alliance

" yah ham jaanate hai
 (but) He cannot break our faith

 India Today's My Axis India exit poll showed BJP getting 19-23 seats, while TMC is projected to win 19-22 out of the total 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state

 2014 ke chunaav main bhaajapa keval 2 loksabhaa siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The exit poll also considered the saffron wave in the state as the reason for the polarization of these votes
 adhikansh hindu vot bijepi ko gaye hai or muslim vot tiemasi ke paksh main gaye

 in sabase bhaajapa ko rajya main hindu voton ko ekajute karne ke liye paryaapt aadhaar mila
 According to exit poll, 65 percent of Muslim votes went in favor of TMC while only 5 percent of Muslim votes went to BJP
 duusari taraf gaiyr-muslim (saamaanya or obisi) voton main se aadhe se zyada vot bhaajapa ko mili hai
 Apart from this, the lower caste Hindu votes also went largely in favor of the BJP
 essi-asti varg main aane vaale 50 pratishat se adhik matadaataaon ne tiemasi or congress ko mukaable bhaajapa ko chunaa
 Mamta's party could get only about 30 percent of these votes
 agsit pole ke mukabik, aankadon ye bhi kah rahe hai pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke mukaable bijepi ke vot kaa pratishat 17 se badhkar 40 pratishat ho saktaa he
 While TMC is believed to retain its vote share in the same manner as 2014, despite losing some seats
 tiemasi or bijepi takkar kii ladaai ladate najar aa rahe hai, vahiin left or congress haarane kii sthiti main hai
 According to the exit poll, the vote share for the Left Front is likely to fall by just one point from the 25 percent it had emerged in the last general election

 Rahul Gandhi will conduct the Haryana elections, five assembly seats in Muslim majority Mewat, Mewat seats of both Congress and BJP: Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi is coming to Mewat to start his election campaign from Monday
 yah muslim bahul ilaaka kabhi congress kaa majboot garh hua karata tha, lekin pichley chunaav main party yahaan apana khaataa bhi nahin khol pai thi
 In such a situation, bjp's eye is on Mewat, hence Manohar Lal Khattar, who won from here, has been fielded by Manohar Lal Khattar in his camp
 yahi vajah he ki congress mevaat main khoi hui apni siyaasi jameen ko waapas laane kii harsambhav koshish main jute gai he
 Muslim voters in Mewat decisive role Muslim voters in Haryana 7
 2 fisadi hai, lekin mevaat main 70 fisadi ke kareeb muslim aabaadi he
 Mewat region has five assembly seats, of which Muslim voters are in a decisive role in Nuh, Punhana, Ferozepur Jhirka assembly seat
 iske alaavasohana or hathin seat par muslim voterkingmekar kii bhoomika main hai
 Let me tell you that in Mewat area, BJP has been trying to strengthen its political land for a long time, but due to the Muslim majority area, it could not make a foothold here
 isi kaa nateeja he ki 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mevaat ilaake kii paanch vidhansabha siton main se mahaj ek seat hi jeet saki thi
 While three seats went to the account of INLD and one seat to independents
 vahiin, congress apana khaataa nahin khol saki thi
 This is the reason why not only BJP and Congress, INLD and JJP have also played bets on Muslims this time
 bijepi kaa muslimon par daanvcongress ne haryana main is barkul 6 muslim pratyaashee maidan main utarahe
 The Congress has fielded Mamman Khan from Ferozepur Jhirka, Ilyas Khan from Punhana, Chaudhary Aftab Ahmed from Nuh, Israel Khan from Hathin, Shamsuddin from Sohna and Akram Khan from Yamunanagar
 vahiin, bijepi ne muslim bahul mevaat kii siyaasi jameen ko upjau banane or is ilaake main camel khilaane ke liye do diggaj muslim netaaon par daanv lagaaya he
 In this, the contest is made interesting by making Zakir Hussain from Noonh and Naseem Ahmed from Ferozepur Jhirka
 congress bhi lubhaane kii puri koshish membijapi mevaat main jahaan camel khilaane kii kavayad main juty he to congress apane khoe hue janaadhar ko waapas laane ke liye rahul gandhi haryana ke nunh se chunavi shankhanaad kar bada sandesh dena chaahate hai
 The Congress in its manifesto has also made a plan to address the issues of Mewat by addressing them
 isamen pramukh taur par mevaat ko metro se jodne, ejineering kalege, vishvavidhyalay banane kaa vaada to mevaat ke kotla jhil ko paryaton ke rup main viksit karne kii baat kahi gai he
 Apart from this, former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda is betting on making four deputy cms when the Congress government comes
 nunh vidhansabha se congress ke ummidavaar choudhary aftab ahamed ne baatcheet main kaha ki nunh jile main 10 saal main kareeb 6000 karod ke vikaas kaary karaae the
 During the Congress time, Noonh was given the gift of a medical college
 iske alaava rail line manjuur karaane, pine ke pani se lekar sinchai ke pani kii vyavastha kii gai thi
 He said that the Congress has come to power whenever
 tab-tab nunh or puure pradesh kaa vikaas hua he
 People are remembering the Congress rule on the same development
 yahi vajah he ki congress ko pasand kar rahi he
 The BJP changed strategy because in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP won all 10 Lok Sabha seats in Haryana, but when it was reviewed legally, it was found that the BJP was behind 11 other parties including the Congress
 ye 11 siten mevaat or jatland ilaake kii thim
 After this, the BJP changed its strategy and mixed Muslim mlas with them and played bets on them
 kiske saath jaaenge muslim?bijepi is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav main mevaat kshetra kii 5 vidhansabha siton ko har haal main jeetna chaahati he
 She is doing everything possible for this
 isliye usne muslimon ko bhi tikat dekar sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas kaa sandesh diya he
 Apart from this, there is a big problem of renewal of drivers' licenses in Mewat, which was also taken by Manohar Lal Khattar
 darasal anivaary yogyata ke niyam kii vajah se mevaat kshetra ke 20,000 se zyada driveron ke license kaa navinikaran nahin ho paa rahaa he
 Khattar demanded the renewal of these driver's licenses and the removal of this rule in the interest of new drivers
 aise main ab dekhnaa hoga ki mevaat kaa muslim bijepi yaa congress kiske saath jayega
 After Lalu Yadav's party was dropped from Rashtriya Janata Dal, Pappu Yadav, MP from Madhepura, has announced to form a new party

 However, Pappu Yadav had said that Lalu Prasad was treating him as a threat to his heritage and hence he has been treated this way
 janata parivaar kaa khel kharaab karenge pappubihaar main janata parivaar ke vilay kii khabaron ke bich pappu yadav kii nai party rajya main hone vaale chunaavon main sabakaa khel bigaad sakati he
 Actually Pappu Yadav was against the merger of RJD and JDU
 rajya main sitambar or oktober main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone vaale hai
 Pappu Yadav's hold is strong in Seemanchal area of bihar
 unki patni ranjita ranjan bhi supaul se saansad hai
 If her party contests elections in these areas, it can spoil the game of both RJD and JDU
 lalu par pappu yadav kaa hamalaparty nikaale jane ke baad pappu yadav ne kaha tha, 'lalu yadav ko apane viraasat kaa khatra tha isliye mujhe nikaala gaya he
 Pappu Yadav further said, 'I talked about strengthening social justice
 ab apane logon ke bich jaaoongaa, phir kadam uthaaungaa
 'recently, Pappu Yadav's name came up for horse trading even during the Jitan Ram Manjhi government's majority in the assembly
 yadav khule taur par maanjhi kaa samarthan bhi kar chuke hai
 They have also been accused of horse trading

 He detailed in what circumstances and on which grounds Ecuador has given shelter to Assange
 unhone is baat kii sambhaavna kaa bhi zikr kiya ki unhen sweden se america ko pratyrpit kiya ja saktaa he
 Asanje's asylum poses a serious situation as Britain has already made it clear that she has the right to enter the Ecuadorian embassy here and arrest a 41-year-old Australian citizen (assange)
 asanje 19 june se yahaan ecuador ke duutavas main chhipe hai
 Britain has said that it is legally obliged to extradite Assange to Sweden
 british videsh mantralay kii ek pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘‘isse (sharan dene se) hamaara rukh nahin badalegaa

 Three people were arrested during a furore between police and Assange supporters
 udhar, vikiliks ne kaha he ki vah britain ke dhamkaane ke maarg par chalane kii kade shabdon main ninda kii
 He said in a statement, "any violation of the dignity of the embassy is unilateral and shameful action and a violation of the Vienna Convention providing protection to embassies worldwide
" ’’ He said that the British threat was intended to eclipse Ecuador's decision whether or not to give Assange political asylum and to bully him into deciding that he should take the decision that Britain and its allies agreed to
 vikiliks ne ek bayaan main kaha,‘‘is tarah kii dhamkee shatrutapurna tathaa ativaadee kadam he
 This is not appropriate for this situation
 yah duniyabar main sharan maangane waalon par ek prakaar kaa hamalaa he
 "he said," We want to draw attention to the fact that the United Nations General Assembly in its 2312 (1967) resolution has unanimously declared that granting of asylum is a peaceful and humane step and that it should be given to any country Can not be taken as non-friendly
 ’’ website ne kaha he ki asanje ko kisi bhi desh main aropit nahin kiya gaya he
 "we want to specifically mention that this incident happened at a time when UK Foreign Minister William Hague assumed executive responsibilities while the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister were on leave," the statement said
 ’’ Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in June, ignoring the British police's order to surrender for extradition to Sweden
 asanje ko raajnneetik sharan dene kii ecuador kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad britain ne kaha ki vah unhen yon aparaadhon ke aaropon kaa saamana karne ke liye sweden pratyrpit karne ke liye baadhya he
 "we are disappointed with the Ecuadorian Foreign Minister's statement that Ecuador has offered political asylum to Julian Assange," the Foreign Ministry said on Twitter
 ’’ The ministry said, "we are determined to resolve through negotiations so that we are allowed to fulfill our obligation under the Extradition Act
" ’’ udhar, america rajanyik gupt dastavejon kaa prakaashan kar america ke nishane par aae asanje ne kaha he ki unke khilaaf lage yon aparaadhon ke aarope raajnneeti se prerit hai
 He said he feared he would eventually be extradited to the US where he could be sued for espionage
 vikiliks ne varsh 2010 main dhai lakh gopneey america rajanyik dastavejon kaa prakaashan kiya tha jinamein iraq or afghanistan yuddh se sambandhit suchanaaen bhi thim
 Britain today said that even if it gives shelter to Assange, it will not give him a safe passage
 britain ke landan main ecuador ke duutavas main ghusane kii baat ko ecuador ne dhamkee qaraar diya or usne apana ruukh kadaa kar liya
 He says that if the British authorities enter his embassy, it would violate the Vienna Convention and would be considered a hostile action
 britain kaa maananaa he ki vah rajanyik chhot ko waapas le saktaa he or rajanyik or mahavanijyik parisar kanoon, 1987 ke tahat duutavas main pravesh kar saktaa he
 a spokesman for the Ecuadorian government said, "we are shocked by the threats of the British government against the sovereignty of the Ecuadorian embassy and the forceful entry into the embassy
" ’’ pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘‘yah vienna sammelan main nirdhaarit kiye gaye antarrashtriya kanoon or protocol kaa spasht ulanghan he
 '' landan main videsh mantralay kii pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘‘ecuador kii sarkaar ke saath apni charchaa ke dauraan hamane apni sthiti hameshaa hi spasht kii he
 The UK is obliged to extradite Assange to Sweden so that he can be questioned in connection with sexual offenses

 The police also broke open the chain attached to tie the barricade

 When the police were asked about this, local junkies started pretending to steal chains

 But due to the darkness and sometimes by tying barricades in this way, the probability of accident increases further
 pehle bhi ho chukaa he haadasilaake main police kii laaparvaahee kaa ye maamla sirf ek baar hi saamne nahi aayaa he
 Even before this, a person named Naveen got stuck in the wire tied with this barricade, but he had good luck and survived

 The forest department has announced a compensation of Rs five lakh to these victims, to calm the anger that is developing in the people
 lekin adhikari abhi tak us khauf kaa koi ilaaj nahin dhund paae hai jise pilibhit tiger rigerv se baahar gum rahe baaghon ne aasapaas ke kul 275 gaanvon main paidaa kar rakhaa he
 The Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, famous for the rare species of bird 'bengal Florgan' in the world, was once notorious for hunting tigers
 april, 2014 main tiger rigerv ghoshit hone ke baad yahaan baaghon kaa shikaar rukaa or inaki sankhya teji se badi
 According to the forest department report, there are currently more than 44 adult tigers in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve
 itane rajya ke duusare kisi vanyajeev kshetra main nahin hai
 But the ever-increasing tiger population has now become a problem for the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (see box)
 baagh jangal chhod rihaishi ilaakon kaa rukh kar rahe hai or pichley nau maheenon main 19 log (23 agast tak) inkaa shikaar ban gaye hai
 Of these, four people have become tiger victims in the last two weeks
 visheshgyon kii fouj nakampilibhit tiger rigerv main pilibhit vanya kshetra kii mahof, maala, baraahi, haripur or dioria range or shahjahanpur vanya kshetra ke kutar range ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 The Mala and Barahi ranges are important for the presence of tigers
 tiger rigerv se baagh ke baahar nikal kar rihaishi ilaakon main hamale kii shuruyaat pichley saal 3 aktubar ko hui jab maala range ke nikat kalinagar tehsil ke nadaha gaanv main meghnath iske shikaar bane
 After this, the terror of the tiger increased and after the death of eight people, in February this year, the forest department caught him from Navadia village of Kalinagar
 iske ek maheene baad phir baagh ke tiger rigerv se baahar aane kii soochna mili
 In Rampura village, near the Mala range, a tiger caught a person as its prey while giving water to the field
 iske baad 1 july tak paanch or log baagh kii chapet main aae
 Only one of these tigers came out of the tiger reserve and killed Mihilal, living here in Shivpuria village of Tehsil Pilibhit
 iske baad ek maheene tak baagh shant rahe lekin agast main ve or bhayanak rup main saamne aae
 During this time, the tiger killed four people and all these prey were penetrated into the residential areas
 7 agast ko jab baagh pilibhit jiladhikari karyaalay ke peeche tak pahunch gaya to van adhikari sakate main aa gaye
 The forest department employed seven teams of experts to catch the tiger roaming in the Banakati and Amaria forests of the Tiger Reserve

 The tiger ate the puddle and the Forest Department officials continued to shake hands
 badal rahaa baaghon kaa swabhaavpilibhit tiger rigerv main adhikariyon ko chakma de rahe baagh ne search oparation kii chunauti badha di he
 Wildlife experts are also surprised by the changing nature of tigers
 pilibhit tiger rigerv ke prabharee kailash prakaash kehete hai, ''baaghon ne zyaadaatar ghatnaon main maanav par hamalaa kar uski jaan le lee par khaaya nahin
 "in some dead bodies, the tiger has eaten only the human genitals
" baaghon ke is badalte swabhaav ne shodhakartaaon ko hairat main daal diya he
 The Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), in charge of the country's only-referral Center for Wildlife Health Care running in Bareilly, Dr
 e
 K
 sharma pilibhit ke baaghon ke vyavhaar ko saamaanya nahin maanate
 Dr
 sharma bataate hai, ''arthritis yaa kisi aisi beemaari jisamen baagh daud paane main asamarth hota he, usase peedit hone par vah jangal se baahar aakar aadamiyon kaa shikaar karata he
 But the way a human is hunting a tiger in Pilibhit is not common
 ”according to experts, some tigers in the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve may suffer from a dog-spreading disease — canine distemper
 dow
 Sharma explains, "canine distemper is a virus that is similar to the virus of 'measles' disease in humans
 yah virus baagh ke mastishk par asar daalata he or vah 'kanfujd mind' kaa ho jaataa he
 In Pilibhit, all the people who were hunting tigers were sitting on the ground
 'kanfujd mind' ke kaaran baagh in logon ko apana shikaar samaj baitha
 a few days ago a tiger carcass in the Pilibhit range was found in the river which had rotted badly
 iviarai bareli main is baagh ke postmortem main uske sharir main kisi kharabi kii baat to saamne nahin ai lekin uskaa pet khaali tha
 Its sample is being tested in the laboratory

 First the women were caught in the forest, then the villagers started opposing the forest department
 iske baad van vibhaag ne bazaar main bikne vaale katrua ko baraamad kar use nasht karne kii karrwai shuru kii
 "we just want to make them realize that they have been caught selling stolen goods," says a forest department official

 However, local leaders of the Samajwadi Party (SP) have come out in protest against this action of the forest department
 pilibhit main sapa ke varisht netaa or purv mantri hemraj verma baagh ke hamale rokane main naakaam van vibhaag ke virodh main logon ko lamaband kar rahe hai
 "three years ago when the tiger reserve was announced, there was a BJP government at the Center," says Verma
 pradesh main sapa sarkaar hone ke kaaran centre se pilibhit tiger rigerv ke liye koi bhi dhan nahin muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya
 For this reason, its boundary could not be formed and tigers are coming out
 ''vahiin vidhansabha chunaav main hemraj verma ko patkhni dene vaale bhaajapa netaa or barkheda vidhansabha kshetra se vidhayak kishan laal rajput aarope lagaate hai, ''tiger rigerv main baaghon kii sankhya badhaane ke liye pichhali sapa sarkaar ne baahar se baagh laakar yaha daal die
 No arrangements were made to protect the forested area
 baaghon ke rihaishi ilaakon main shikaar karne kii yah badi vajah he
 "obviously, the tiger is ravaging housemates one by one, and politicians are busy cooking political loaves

 gadakari ne kaha ki kerala main 14 maheene main 14 kaaryakartaaon kii hatya hui he, patrakaron par ho rahe hamalon kii bhi baithak main charchaa hui
 Nitin Gadkari said that our party is in favor of OBC reservation, we do not consider people who do not have roti-cloth-houses
 new india ke sapane ko saakaar karnaa he, unhone kaha ki party is sapane ko saakaar karne ke liye kaam karegi
 Shahpiyush Goyal, who will undertake a padyatra in Kerala, told the media about the executive meeting, "condemning the political violence in Kerala and Bengal, Amit Shah said that BJP workers are not afraid of violence
 rashtriya kaaryakarini main amit shah ne kaha ki hinsa kaa keechad koi kitna bhi failaae, bhaajapa kaa camel utana hi zyaada nikhaar ke aayega
 With this, the BJP president said that the party workers will undertake a padyatra in Kerala from October 3-17
 'amit shah ne is baithak main kaha, 'dekhte jaaie, 2019 kii jeet pehle se bhi badi hogi
 He said that every citizen of India wants the country to be free from dirt, poverty, appeasement politics etc

 BJP President Ravindra Raina said on Saturday that Pakistan is the real enemy of Muslims and Kashmiris and will be given a befitting reply if he and his terrorists make any audacity
 vah soshal media par aaye ek kathith video par pratikriya de rahe the jisamen hijbul mujahidin kaa pramukh saiyad salahuddin pakistan se uske muhim kaa samarthan karne kaa aahvaan karata hua najar aa rahaa he
 Raina said that Pakistan is providing support, training, weapons and funds for terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha, ‘‘pakistan musalamaanon or kashmir ke logon kaa asli dushman he
 He is responsible for killing more than one lakh people and massacre of Kashmiri Pandits
 ''unhone kaha ki pakistan aatankwaadiyon ko samarthan jari rakhkar duniya ke saamne benakaab ho gaya he
 The BJP president said, "pakistan is behind the terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir
 hamaare paas modi ke rup main majboot pradhanmantri hai jo pakistan or uske yahaan ke aatankwaadiyon ke kisi bhi dussahas kaa munhtod jawaab denge
 "he said," Any action that is conspiring against our country and its people will have to be faced

 In the video message, Salahuddin is repealing most of the provisions of Article 370 and dividing the state into two union territories, saying that the present situation is not acceptable to the people of Kashmir

 Seeing that his condition did not improve here, the RIMS administration constituted a medical board and examined his health and sent its report to the CBI court
 is report main behatar ilaaj ke liye ames bhejne kii anushansa kii gai thi
 Significantly, Lalu Prasad has been in jail since December

 modi sarkaar ke khilaaf kal hone vaale avishvaas prastaav se thik pehle shivasena ne ek bada faisla liya he
 Uddhav Thackeray, who has been mobilizing against the BJP for some time, has decided to vote in support of the Modi government in a no-confidence motion
 darasal bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne shivasena adhyaksh uddhav thakare ko phone kiya, jiske baad thakare kaa yah faisla aayaa he
 Significantly, to give Andhra Pradesh special state status, the TDP is bringing a no-confidence motion against the Modi government
 2019 se thik pehle vipaksh ko apni takat dikhaane kaa yah bada mauka dikh rahaa he
 But now the Shiv Sena's decision to support the Kemodi government has given a major blow to the opposition
 545 sadasyon vaali loksabhaa main maujuuda samay main 535 saansad hai
 That means only 267 mps are needed to make the BJP very comfortable
 loksabhaa adhyaksh ko hataakar bijepi ke paas abhi 273 sadsy hai
 Apart from this, bjp's allies have 18 members from Shiv Sena, 6 from LJP, 4 from Akali Dal, 3 from RLSP, 2 from JDU, 2 from Apna Dal
 is tarah se kul sankhya 314 pahunch rahi he
 In such a situation, the BJP will have no problem in dropping the no confidence motion and saving the government
 avishvaas prastaav modi sarkaar ke liye agnipariksha kii tarah he
 The BJP currently has 273 mps in the Lok Sabha alone, while it needs a figure of 272 mps for a majority
 aise main bijepi ke paas bahumat se ek sadsy zyada he
 But at present, many BJP mps are rebel
 inamen shatrughna sinha, kirti aaazaad or savitri bai phule shaamil hai
 In such a situation, if the three seats are reduced, the BJP has a figure of 270, while it needs only 267 votes for the majority
 matlab modi sarkaar ko avishvaas prastaav giraane ke liye sahyogiyon kii bhi jarurat nahin he
 Talking about the opposition parties, Congress currently has the maximum 48 seats in the Lok Sabha
 avishva sa prastaalav laane vaali tidipi ke paas 16 siten hai, jabaki jedies ke 1, ensipi ke 7, argedy ke 4, tiemasi ke 34, sipiiem ke 9, sapa ke 7 sadsy hai

 uttar pradesh main aparaadhiyon par lagaam kasne or kanoon vyavastha ko durust karne ke liye mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne police ko khuli chhot de rakhi he
 After this, the UP Police launched an encounter campaign taking drastic action against the culprits
 haalanki ise lekar sawaal bhi khadey hue, lekin sarkaar ne isse koi samjhauta nahin kiya
 Yogi Adityanath said that we have a policy of zero tolerance towards criminals

 unhone apni is ardhashtakeey pari main 6 chauke or 1 chakka lagaaya
 With this, Cummins has become the first Australian to take five wickets in a match after the half-century in 2013

 The new Australian captain showed passion, came down to the crease with a broken thumb, when he came to bat, Australia scored six wickets for 96 runs, but after that he teamed up with captain Tim Paine for the seventh wicket for 99
 Partnership of runs
 gauratlab he ki johanisburg test main toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne utari dakshin africa team ne 488 ran banaae the
 For the hosts, Aiden Mercram had the highest score of 152 runs while Pat Cummins took the highest five wickets for Australia
 jawaab main australia kii pehali pari mahaj 221 ranon par hi dher ho gai
 In this way, South Africa got a lead of 267 runs on the basis of first innings
 aapako bataa den ki gend se chhedchhad maamle ke baad yah pehla test he
 The third test ball made headlines with the tempering controversy

 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was unhappy with Rakesh Maria, who is investigating the Sheena Bora murder case
 sutron ke hawaale se yah baat saamne ai he
 It is being said that for this reason he was made the DG (homeguard) from Mumbai Police Commissioner before promotion
 darasal, shuruaati stage par cese main maaria ke nijee taur par dilchaspee lene se koi dikkat nahin thi
 The investigation of such complex cases is usually handed over to the crime branch
 lekin shina cese main aisa nahin hua
 There was a possibility of going wrong message from 26 / 11 to Neeraj Grover case investigation was handed over to Crime Branch
 lekin shina bora cese main joint police kamishnar (krime) ko dur rakhaa gaya
 The case was not given to the crime branch
 sutron ke mutabik isse police mahakme or logon main galat sandesh jane kii ashanka thi
 Earlier, top cop was not involved
 Earlier, in investigation of high profile cases like Daholkar and Pansare, no top coop like Maria was ever involved
 maaria kii nigaraanee se hogi yah pareshanisutron ke mutabik ab local police ko pareshaani hogi ki unhen mumbai police kamishnar ke saath-saath maaria ko bhi report karnaa padegaa

 Stray dreams of wandering in the lonely streets of Mananind wandering in sleep
 second-sho se lautati hui biimaar texiyaan,bhojpuri churi jaisi chikhembehosh aurat kii thahari hui aankhon kii tarah raat
 Electric poles are constantly chased; the shadows are left far away and the shadows break
 main akelaa hoon
 i blossom in taxis for no reason, i stand silently in the dark on the sidewalk
 bhothari churi jaisi chikhenor aandhi main tuutate hue khule daravaajon kii tarah thahaakeek sathamere kaleje se ubharate hanmain andhere main hoon or chupchaap hoon 
 The tip of Satmi's moon slams in my back
 mere lahu se bhig jate hai texiyon ke aaraamdeh gaddephutpath par rengte rahete hai surkh-surkh daag
 The window of any tall house does not peck the cumbersome eyelids in sleep
 kisi hare paudhe kii komal, nanhee shakhen,shakhen or phool,phool or sugandhiyanmeri aatma main nahin failati hai
 i am also in a taxi and standing on the sidewalk
 minsoe hue shahar kii nas-nas menkisi maasoom bachche kii tarah, jisaki maan kho gai he,bhatakta rahata hoon,(meri nai aazaadee or meri nai musiibat
 
 
 Uff!) Scream and shout emerge from my heart together

 The last song of love (I and you) completes itself by opening the ground between the arms as it is afraid to open it in front of the age, the heat of our body, the fever of our desires, your stupa; Minarets standing near my grave

 To be engulfed in you, in a special state of physical inertia and wildness, you produce me
 You bow down, and you break and you clap like a wounded cat, and i will produce you as a baby
 You sleep in me and do not wake up until i return from office
 jab baat pardes main musiibat main fanse bhartiya nagarikon kii ho, to videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko shaayad hi kabhi aalochana kaa shikaar hona padataa he
 From arranging visas for stranded Indian citizens, evacuating sailors from hazardous areas such as exploits, Sushma Swaraj is also active on information received through a tweet
 pareshanhal logon ke prati kisi bhi prakaar kii sahanubhuti nahin dikhaane ke liye kukhyat rahi naukarshahi ko ve bharatiyon kii sahaayta ke liye tatkaal kaam par laga detii hai
 But on March 20, when he informed the parliament about the brutal killing of 39 laborers missing in Iraq at the hands of the terrorist organization ISIS, the government was very angry
 is ghoshnaa ke saath hi 39 laapata logon ke pariwaron kii kareeb chaar saal se apane swajanon kii talash ke liye chal rahi bhagdaud par ek viraam lag gaya
 Of these, 22 people belonged to various districts of Punjab, Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Jalandhar
 shesh pashchim bengal, bihar or himachal pradesh ke bascindia the
 The members of the victims' families were shocked when they received information about the death of their families through television
 is ghoshnaa ke turant baad pratikriya dete hue maare gaye mazdooron main se ek manjinder singh kii bahan gurupinder cor ne kaha, ''main to intjaar kar rahi hum ki kab unase (swaraj) mulaakaat ho
 i will definitely ask them why we have not been given any information in advance about our family members
 hamen to sansad main unke bayaan se pataa chalaa
 "the Armed Forces insist that in any event, the next of kin of the person should be informed about the casualty's name before going to the media
" sarkaar ne maare gaye 39 logon ke sandarbh main thos sakshya kii pratiksha karte hue swaraj dwaara ghoshnaa se ek din pehle puri prakriya kaa paalan kiya
 Swaraj cannot be blamed for informing Parliament about the casualties
 chunki sansad kaa satr chal rahaa he, aise main yadi swaraj ne aisi mahatvapurn jaankaree press conference ke jariye di hoti, to ise sansad kii avmaananaa samajha jaataa
 So where did the government lapse? Senior bureaucrats say that the government was in constant contact with the victims' families for the last four years, yet they were not personally informed
 naam na chhapane kii shart par ek purv rajanyik kehete hai, ''videsh mantri ne pehle yah soochna sansad ko dekar uchit prakriya kaa paalan kiya he lekin jis samay vah sansad ko suchit kar rahi thim, usee dauraan agar peedit pariwaron ko bhi sampark sadhakar suchit kiya gaya hota, to behatar rahata
 "by creating a general coordination between the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of External Affairs, an officer could be informed by sending them to the homes of the victims of various states
" swaraj ke mantralay ne laapata logon ko khoj nikaalane kii disha main chaar saal tak jitani mashkkat kii he, uske saamne yah to bahut chota-sa kaam tha
 To be honest, the Ministry of External Affairs, led by Swaraj, worked hard to find the missing Indian laborers
 is khooni khel kii shuruyaat modi sarkaar ke gathan ke turant baad june, 2014 main hui thi jab iageies ne iraq ke tisare sabase bade shahar mosul ko jeet liya
 This was the first challenge faced by Sushma Swaraj after assuming the foreign ministry chair
 is mudde ko pradhanmantri ne vibhinn antarrashtriya manchon par uthaaya tha
 Swaraj himself also tried hard for this and when the Iraqi army freed Mosul from ISIS occupation, he tried to trace those laborers to his junior minister general (re

 The government refused to accept the claim of Harjit Christ, the fortyth laborer who escaped from ISIS occupation, that all the other laborers working with him had been killed

 charchaa is baar phir aparaadh kii duniya se judi hui he
 DP Yadav is accused that he was running the biggest bet of North India while sitting in Dehradun jail
 satta koi chota motaa nahin balki arabon kaa hota tha
 The largest betting of North India, which was run from several states like Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, including the capital of the country, and one day turnover of this bet was around 30 crores
 yani 30 karod rupye roj satte kii is kaali duniya main lagaae jate the or saare kharche or satorion, panter kaa paisa dekar rose kareeb 5 karod rupye munafa bhi kama liya jaataa tha
 ALSO READ: Murder of famous models happened, know date-by-date, full story, turnover of crores was going on every year since 2005

 inkaa rutaba itnaa tha ki ye kisi netaa ki tarah ambesader gaadi main ghumaa karte the
 The most shocking revelation is that DP Yadav, who is imprisoned for the murder of an MLA, is the kingpin of this entire racket
 aropiyon par macokadiseepi ajit kumaar singhla ne bataaya ki cese kii jaanch karte hue police ne pichley saal 9 logon par macoka lagaaya tha
 These include Roshan Lal Sharma, Amarnath Bajaj, Kulwinder, Indrapal, Sandeep Sehgal, Pradeep Chopra, Rajeev Anand, Vijay Bedi, besides the names of DP Yadav

 in 10 dinon main deepi yadav is racket ke neshnal auki international conaction ke bare main chaukaaney vaala bada khulaasa kar saktaa he
 millionairedp Yadav, who became close to DP Yadav, is associated with this speculative racket not for today but for 15 years
 2005 tak dilli main satte kaa sargana om prakaash sobhti tha
 But after Sobhati's death in 2005, the entire business started running DP Yadav

 Through extreme poverty, both of them became millionaires by speculative business
 in donon kii pichhali jindagi ke bare main bhi jaananaa behad jaruri he
 Roshanlal and Amarnath's story Roshn Lal Lal Varma is a resident of Ludhiana and left his family and came to Delhi
 80 ke dashak main vah dilli main rickshaw chalaane kaa kaam karata tha lekin sangati or jald bada aadmi banane kii lalak ke chalate vah deepi yadav ke sharaab ke dhandhe main aa gaya
 Roshan Lal Verma started working with him in the 90s
 dhire dhire uski deepi yadav se uski nazdikiyaan badi or vah deepi yadav kaa manager ban gaya
 From 2005 he started running betting in many cities including Delhi
 isi tarah se amarnath bajaj kii kahani bhi filmi he
 He is also a resident of Ludhiana and came to this business in association with Roshanlal
 amarnath 80 ke dashak main dilli ke kashmiri get ilaake main chaay bechaa karata tha
 And in the 90s he got into a liquor business with DP Yadav and his days changed
 is tarah se ye donon garibi ko peeche dhakka dete hue satte or sharaab ke kaarobaar se karodpati ban gaye
 Business of dishonesty used to be dishonest
 There is a principle of bookies that dishonesty also has to be done honestly
 yani company ke member roshanalaal verma, amarnath bajaj or baaki ke kuch log the, jinhen deepi yadav kaa sangrakshan hasil hota tha
 At present, 9 people including DP Yadav, Roshanlal Sharma, Amarnath are under police custody

 yah to ham sabhi jaanate hai ki hormones hamaare shaareerik vikaas main kitni ahm bhoomika nibhaate hai
 a recent study reveals shocking
 adhyayan kii report daawa karti he ki hormones se keval sharirik vikaas hi nahin hota, balki hamaara vyavhaar or bhavanaaen bhi hormones par hi aadhaarit hoti hai
 This study has been done by researchers of the University of California
 shodhakartaaon kii maane tohamaara swabhaav or vichaarhamare andar maujuud hormones hi tay karte hai
 Also, he also said that the level of hormones is different in every human being
 jis kaaran har vyakti kaa vyavhaar ek duusare se kaaphi alag dekha jaataa he
 Learn how the existing hormones work in the body: Oxytocin hormone: This is a hormone found in our body, which creates a feeling of love in us for a person
 is hormone kii maatra sharir main zyada hone ke kaaran vyakti dusron ke prati bahut jaldi aakarshith hone lagata he
 Serotonin hormone: At what time you get angry, it depends on serotonin hormone
 yah hormone hamaare dimag ko shant rakhane main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Also, this hormone determines whether the person is more or less angry
 tesatoron hormone:agar sharir me maujuud is hormone kaa santulan bighad jaae to yah kai bimariyon ko janm de saktaa he
 Both the increase and occurrence of this hormone is harmful for the body
 agar isharmone kaa level zyada ho jaeto aapako kai tarah kii samasyaayein ho sakati hai
 Such as weight gain, hair fall, nail pimples etc
 jabaki is hormone ke ghatane se stan cancer or dil se judi bimaariyaan hoti hai
 Thyroid hormone: This hormone is like a gland in our body, the hormones produced by this gland affect the ability of a person to function
 is hormone kii kami ke kaaran vyakti ko jaldi thakaan mahasoos hone lagati he, or sharir sust ho jaataa he
 Let us know that this hormone is found in more quantity in women than men
 maujuuda cash sankat kii ek badi vajah 2000 ke noton kii jamkhori ko mana ja rahaa he
 The truth is that 2000 notes have not been printed since the middle of last year
 aise main is bade note kii jamkhori or sabhi atm 200 rupee ke note vitaran ke liye taiyaar nahin hone kii vajah se khel kaaphi bighad gaya or desh ke kai hisson main atm khaali dikhne lage
 2000 notes were brought during demonetisation in 2016 so that the condition of the economy can improve rapidly
 ek baar phir cash kii killat ko dekhte hue mangalvaar ko sarkaar or rigerv bank ne kaaphi sakriyata dikhaai or un ilaakon main cash bhejne kii koshish kii, jahaan isaki tangi ho gai thi
 The government claims that there is no shortage of cash and in some states cash is not available in atms
 lekin sach to yah he ki desh ke sabhi hisson main aam janata ko nakadi kii dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Senior sources in the government say that the printing of 2000 notes has been stopped since the middle of the last year
 aankadon ke mutabik is samay market main 6
 2000 notes worth 7 lakh crores are in circulation
 yah cirkulation main jari kul 18
 04 lakh crore is one-third of the notes
 is tarah samay bazaar main cash 2016 kii notebandi se chaar din pehle cirkulation main maujuud 17
 74 lakh crores more than the notes
 sutron ke mutabik sarkaar ko aisi report mili ki badi maatra main bainkon se nikaale gaye 2000 ke note market main waapas nahin aa rahe hai
 That is, they are being hoarded in a way
 isaki vajah se kuch maheenon pehle hi sarkaar or rigerv bank ne nirnay liya ki 2000 ke nae note nahin jari kiye jaaenge
 To prevent hoarding of big notes and to reduce the dependence of the system on this note, it was decided that 200 notes should be issued as much as possible
 200 ke note vitaran ke liye taiyaar nahin sabhi atiemamushkil ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar kii yojana zyada se zyada 500, 200 or 100 ke note cirkulation main laane kii he
 However, not all ATM machines have been calibrated to keep 200 new notes, that is, they have not changed
 kuch ilaakon main to mahaj 30 fisadi atm hi 200 ke noton ke vitaran ke liye taiyaar hai
 This triggered a crisis in these areas, as 2000 notes were few and 200 notes could not be distributed in sufficient numbers
 april main khub cash nikaal rahe logaarthik maamalon ke vibhaag ke sachiv subhash garg ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki desh main nakadi kii koi kami nahin he or kareeb 1
 75 lakh crore worth of currency is in reserve
 unhone kaha ki aamtaur par ek maheene main 20,000 karod rupee cash kii maang hoti he, lekin april ke pehle 13 dinon main hi 45,000 karod rupee nikaale gaye
 Bank Officers Association spokesperson Ashwini Rana also said that atms have not been calibrated to distribute 200 notes and that there has been a massive hoarding of 2000 notes
 bade note bainkon main waapas nahin aa rahe
 Printing of 500 notes will increase five times, Subhash Garg said that the government has decided to increase printing of 500 notes as well
 abhi har din 500 karod mulya ke 500 rupee ke noton kii chapai kii jaati he (1 karod pis), lekin ab sarkaar har din 2500 karod mulya ke noton (5 karod pis) kii chapai karegi
 Cashless economy not due to demonetisation, demand for increased cash Finance Minister is saying that due to higher demand than usual, it has been delayed
 rigerv bank ke strot kehete hai ki kai rajyon main tyoharon or anya vajahon se cash kii maang kaaphi bad gai
 Have reviewed the currency situation in the country
 Over all there is more than adequate currency in circulation and also available with the Banks
 The temporary shortage caused by 'sudden and unusual increase' in some areas is being tackled quickly
 — Arun Jaitley (@arunjaitley)april 17, 2018lekin sach to yah he ki sarkaar or rigerv bank is sankat kaa andaja lagane main vifal rahe hai
 People associated with the cash management and transportation sector say that after 18 months of demonetisation, the condition is that the dependence on cash has increased
 is field ke jaankaar kehete hai kinotbandi ke bapub zyada log nakadi main lenden kar rahe hai or cash kaa istemaal 30 se 35 fisadi bad gaya he

 Today is Eid again
 samoochee duniya main ullas va prem kaa vaataavaran he
 In such a situation, it is natural to remember the idol 'idgah', the classic story of the Hindi legend Emperor Munshi Premchand
 kuch kahaniyaan aisi hoti hai, jo samay va kaal kii seemaa se pare hoti hai
 Idgah is one of them
 id, id ke utsav, gramin kshetra main is utsav kii umang or bal manovigyaan par likhi yah kahani apane prabhaav main apratim he
 The terrible economic problems, poverty and crisis of Indian rural families also prove to be dwarfed by the love and condolences of a small child to his grandmother
 munshi premchand ne behad saral or vyaavhaarik bhashaa main yah siddh kar diya he ki umangon ke liye, prem va lagaav ke liye dhan ek behad chota tatv he, or shaayad ise hi aaj kaa samaaj vismrit karata ja rahaa he
 How this story has affected the entire Indian subcontinent can also be gauged from a statement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 may 2018 main 'pradhanmantri ujjwala yojana' ke labhaarthiyon se baat karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha tha ki is yojana kii prerana unhen munshi premchand kii kahani 'idgah' se mili thi
 He said, "while cooking food, grandmother's hands do not get burnt, so Hamid brings the tongs, i thought when one can do Hamid, why can't the Prime Minister of the country do it
 "aaj id ke avasar par ek baar phir sahitya ajtak par padhe, munshi premchand kii yah kaaljayi kahani;kahani: idgad- premchandramazan ke puure tees rojon ke baad id ai he
 How beautiful, so pleasant morning
 vrikshon par kuch ajeeb hariyaali he, kheton main kuch ajeeb raunak he, aasmaan par kuch ajeeb laalimaa he
 Look at today's sun, how sweet, so cold, as if greeting the world on Eid
 gaanv main kitni halchal he
 Preparations are going on to go to Idgah
 kisi ke kurte main batan nahin he, pados ke ghar se sui-taagaa laane ko dauda ja rahaa he
 Somebody's shoes are hardened, they run to Teli's house to pour oil
 jaldi-jaldi belon ko sani-pani de den
 Returning from Idgah will be noon
 teen kos kaa paidal rasta, phir saikadon aadamiyon se milanaa, bhent karnaa
 Returning before noon is impossible
 ladke sabase zyada prasann hai
 Some have kept a fast, that too till noon, none of that, but the joy of going to Idgah is a part of their part
 roje bade-buudhon ke liye honge
 It is Eid for them
 roj id kaa naam ratate the
 Today she arrived
 ab jaldi padi he ki log idgah kyon nahin chalate
 What purpose do they have from family concerns
 sevaiyon ke liye doodh or shakkar ghar main he yaa nahin, inaki bhalaa se, ye to sevaiyaan khaayenge
 What should they know about why Badbahas are running to Chaudhary Kayamali's house! What is the news to them that if Chaudhary turns his eyes today, then all this Eid becomes Muharram
 unki apni jebon main to kuber kaa dhan bharaa hua he
 Repeatedly count your treasure out of pocket and keep it happy again
 mahmud ginata he, ek-do, das-baarah
 He has twelve paise
 mohsin ke paas ek, do, teen, aath, nau, pandrah paise hai
 In these countless money, you will bring countless things - toys, sweets, bugle, balls and what-what! And Hamid is most happy
 vah chaar-paanch saal kaa garib-surat, dublaa-patala ladkaa, jiskaa baap gat varsh haije kii bhent ho gaya or maan na jane kyon pili hoti-hoti ek din mar gai
 No one knows what the disease is
 kahati bhi to koun sunne vaala tha
 What used to pass on the heart, she endured in the heart and when not endured, she left the world
 ab hamid apni budhi daadi ameena kii god main sota he or utana hi prasann he
 His father has gone to earn Rs
 bahut-si theliyaan lekar aayenge
 Ammijan has gone to bring all the good things for him from Allahmiyan's house, so Hamid is happy
 aashaa to badi cheez he or phir bacchon kii aashaa! unki kalpana to rai kaa parvat bana leti hai
 Hamid has no shoes on his feet, an old-fashioned hat on the head, which has turned black, yet he is happy
 jab uske abbajaan theliyaan or ammijaan niamaten lekar aaengi to vah dil ke armaan nikaal legaa
 Then Mahmud, Mohsin, Noor and Sammi will see how much money they will withdraw
 abhaagini ameena apni kothri main baithi ro rahi he
 Today is Eid day and there is no grain in his house
 aaj aabid hota to kya isi tarah id aati or chali jaati? is andhkaar or niraashaa main vah dubi ja rahi he
 Who called this Nigodi Eid? He has nothing to do with this household, But Hamid! What does it mean for someone to die? There is light inside, hope outside
 vipatti apana sara dalbal lekar aae, hamid kii anand-bhari chitwan uskaa vidhwans kar degi
 Hamid goes inside and tells grandmother - Amma, don't you be afraid, i will go first
 bilkul na darana
 a fair was organized from the village
 or bacchon ke saath hamid bhi ja rahaa tha
 Occasionally all of them ran to get ahead
 phir kisi ped ke neeche khadey hokar saath waalon kaa intjaar karte
 Why are these people walking so slowly? Hamid's feet have been put on
 vah kabhi thak saktaa he? shahar kaa daaman aa gaya
 There are rich people gardens on both sides of the road
 pakki charadivari bani hui he
 Mangoes and leeches are planted in the trees
 kabhi-kabhi koi ladkaa kankad uthaakar aam par nishaanaa lagaataa he
 The gardener turns out to be abusive from the inside
 ladke vahaan se ek furlongs par hai
 Are laughing a lot
 mali ko kaise ullu banaaya he!ab basti ghani hone lagi thi
 Groups of Idgah goers started appearing
 ek se ek bhadkile vastra pahane hue, koi ikke-taange par savaar, koi motor par, sabhi itr main based, sabhi ke dilon main umang
 The small group of villagers, oblivious to their misfortune, were merry in satisfaction and patience
 bacchon ke liye nagar kii sabhi chizein anokhi thim
 Whatever you looked at, you would keep staring
 or peeche se baar-baar horn kii aawaaj hone par bhi na chetate
 Hamid survived by going under the motor
 sahasaa idgah najar aayaa
 There is cool shade of tamarind tree upstairs
 neeche pakkaa farsh he, jis par jajim bicha hua he or rojedaaron kii panktiyaan ek ke pichheek na jane kahan tak chali gai hai, pakki jagat ke neeche tak, jahaan jajim bhi nahin he
 Newcomers come and stand in the back row
 aage jagah nahin hai
 Nobody sees money or position here
 islam kii nigaah main sab baraabar hai
 These villagers also did the waju and stood in the back row
 kitna sundar sanchaalan he, kitni sundar vyavastha! lakhon sir ek saath sijade main jhuk jate hai, phir sab-ke-sab ek saath khadey ho jate hai
 Bend together and kneel down together
 kai baar yahi kriya hoti he, jaise bijli kii lakhon battiyaan ek saath pradipt hon or ek saath bujh jaaen or yahi kram chalata rahe
 What a unique scene, whose collective actions, expansion and infinity filled the heart with reverence, pride and self-respect
 maanon bhraatrutiv kaa ek sutara in samast atmaaon ko ek ladi main piroe hue hai
 Namaz is over, people are embracing each other
 tab mithai or khilone kii dukaan par dhaava hota he
 The group of villagers is no less enthusiastic than the boys in this matter
 yah dekho, hindola he
 Go by paying a penny
 kabhi aasmaan par jate hue maaloom honge, kabhi jameen par girte hue
 There is a wheel, wooden elephants, horses, camels, hanging with sticks
 ek paisa dekar baith jaao or pachchis chakkaron kaa majaa lo
 Mahmud and Mohsin, Noor and Sammi sit on these horses and camels
 hamid dur khadaa he
 Just three paisa is all that he has
 apane kosh kaa ek tihaai, jaraa-sa chakkar khaane ke liye, vah nadeen de saktaa
 Sweets are followed by toys
 kisi ne revadiyaan lee hai, kisi ne gulab jamun, kisi ne sohan halava
 Having fun
 hamid birdari se pruthak he
 The unfortunate have three pennies
 kya nahin kuch lekar khaataa? lalachaai aankhon se sabaki or dekhtaa he
 After the sweets, some shops are made of iron, some gilt and some fake jewelry
 ladakon ke liye yahan koi aakarshan na tha
 They all move forward
 hamid lohe kii dukaan par ruk jaataa he
 Many tongs were kept
 use khyaal aayaa, daadi ke paas chimata nahin he
 When we remove the roti from the pan, the hand burns
 agar vah chimata le jaakar daadi ko de de, to vah kitni prasann hongi! phir unki ungliyaan kabhi na jalengi
 There will be a useful thing at home
 khilone se kya faaydaa
 Money is wasted in vain
 usne dukandaar se poocha, yah chimata kitne kaa he?dukandaar ne uski ore dekha or koi aadmi saath na dekhakar kaha, ‘yah tumhaare kaam kaa nahin he ji’‘bikaoo he ki nahin?’‘bikaoo kyon nahin he? or yahan kyon lad laae hai?’‘to bataate kyon nahin, kai paise kaa he?’‘chah paise lagenge?’hamid kaa dil baith gaya
 'please tell exactly
 ’‘thik-thaak paanch paise lagenge, lenaa ho lo, nahin to chalate bano’hamid ne kalejaa majboot karke kaha- teen paise loge?yah kahata hua vah aage bad gaya ki dukandaar kii ghudkiyaan na sune
 But the shopkeeper did not turn around
 bulaakar chimata de diya
 Hamid placed him on his shoulder like a gun, and gracefully strutted to the fellows
 gyaarah baje saare gaanv main halchal much gai
 Fair people came
 mohsin kii choti bahan ne daudkar bhishti uske haath se chin liya or maare khushi ke jo uchhali, to miyaan bhishti neeche aa gaye or surlok sidhaare
 On this, brother and sister got beaten up
 donon khub roe
 Hearing his mother's noise, he deteriorated and put them on top of each other
 ab miyaan hamid kaa haal suniye
 Ameena ran as soon as he heard her voice and picked her up and fell in love
 sahaja uske haath main chimata dekhakar vah chaunki
 "where was this tong?" ’‘kai paise main?’‘teen paise die
 'amina thrashed her chest
 yah kaisaa besamajh ladkaa he ki dopaher hua, kuch khaaya, na piya
 Brought what, tweezers
 saare meley main tuje or koi chiz na mili jo yah lohe kaa chimata uthaa laayaa?hamid ne apradhi-bhav se kaha- tumhaari oongliyaan tave se jal jaati thim, isliye maine ise liya
 The old lady's anger immediately turned into affection, and affection is not even that which appears, and spreads all its cuss in words
 yah mook sneh tha, khub thos, ras or swaad se bharaa hua
 How much sacrifice, how much harmony and wisdom in a child! How tempting it must have been to see others taking toys and eating sweets! How could he seize so much? There too it remained a memory of his old grandmother
 ameena kaa man gadgad ho gaya
 And now a very strange thing happened
 hamid ke is chimate se bhi vicitra
 The child Hamid played the part of old Hamid
 buudhiya ameena balika ameena ban gayi
 She began to cry
 daaman failaakar hamid ko duaen detii jaati thi or ansu kii badi-badi boonden giraati jaati thi
 What would Hamid understand its secret

 Let me tell you that since the show started Vishal and Madhurima do not leave any chance to tighten each other

 Vishal refused to embrace Madhurima despite Judges saying
 lekin ladaai or nafrat ke bich madhurima ke liye vishaal kaa pyaar dekhnaa audiyans ke liye kaaphi dilachasp rahegaa
 Talking about the relationship, Madhurima and Vishal were seen together in the show "chandrakanta"

 Sachin Tendulkar is such a person who when he was in the field, the whole world used to ask why he was not retiring and now that he has announced a complete retirement from the game, everyone is surprised as if something untoward has happened
 desh kii raajnneeti main jaise congress party kaa arth nehru-gandhi parivaar hota he, vaise hi assi or nabbe ke dashak main janme logon ke liye cricket kaa arth sachin tendulkar rahaa he
 It is Sachin who taught our generation to love this game
 alam ye tha ki sachin out to aadhe log to niraashaa main match dekhnaa hi band kar dete the
 Even though his career was not like that of Sourav Ganguly, but after seeing his two innings, everyone announced that India has got the next super-star after Sunil Gavaskar
 gavaskar to sirf test cricket ke diggaj the, sachin to guru gud ko peeche chhod shakkar bhi ho gaye
 Not only in Test cricket, but also in the one-day cricket, the feat he waved, will continue to sway for many centuries
 mujhe achche se yaad he nabbe kaa wo dashak, jab ek-divasiy cricket main das se zyada shatak lagane vaale do-chaar gine-chune ballebaajon main sachin kaa naam shaamil tha or ise ek badi uplabdhi mana jaataa tha
 Now thinking about breaking the century of the centuries he has set, the young batsmen lose their sweat
 ballebaaji ke saath unki sabase badi khubi, jisane unako vaaki main ek mahamanav bana diya, thi unki vinamrata or khel ke prati unka samarpan
 Many cricketers are more openly than suppressed tongue and some say that Brian Lara was a more dangerous batsman than Sachin
 kariyar kii shuruyaat main vinod kambli unase adhik pratibhashali samajhe jate the
 But today, see where Kambli is? All this is made possible by love and hard work of Sachin's game, from which the whole world can learn
 sachin kaa cricket kariyar na keval cricketrs, balki sabhi vyavsaayon se jude logon ko hameshaa hi prerana detaa rahegaa or yah sikhaata rahegaa ki aap jis bhi disha main kariyar bananaa chaahate hai, aapaki jitani chaahe aalochana ho, aapke ird-gird jitna chaahe bhrashtachar ho, yadi aap puri lagan or samarpan se kaam karenge to koi bhi aapako safalataa kii bulandiyon tak pahunchane se roak nahin saktaa

 If the Governor earlier invites BJP to form the government as the most party in Maharashtra, then BJP President Amit Shah will take a decision on forming the government after talking to the central leadership and BJP leaders of Maharashtra

 shivasena se phir baatcheet?bijepi netritv chahta he ki jis tarah se shivasena ne baatcheet kaa silsilaa band kiya tha usee tarah se shivasena hi baatcheet kaa silsilaa shuru kiya jaae
 Significantly, no party had got an absolute majority in the Maharashtra assembly elections
 bijepi ko 105, shivasena ko 56, ensipi ko 54 or congress ko 44 seat mili thim
 The magic figure to form a government is 145
 bijepi or shivasena agar saath aate hai to unke baar 161 seat hai, jo sarkaar banane ke liye paryaapt he
