 For this, it is necessary that all small and big businesses should be given time in the beginning so that they can understand this new tax system and become part of it

 Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is rarely seen laughing or smiling in public places or in government functions
 somvaar 11:30 baje se lekar 12:30 baje tak 1 ghante tak rajbhavan main shapath grahan samaaroh chalaa
 In which Ashok Gehlot appeared under tension, but amidst this tension, Gehlot smiled for 10 seconds that the discussion about it is everywhere in Rajasthan
 shapath grahan samaaroh main rajyapal kalyaan singh ke ek taraf mukhyamantri ashok gahalot baithe the to duusari taraf up mukhyamantri sachin payalat
 Ashok Gehlot was calling out the names of the mlas joining his cabinet one by one and a mike was placed next to which he was reciting the oath
 ve mike ke hi bagal main rakhi hui kursi par baithkar apana hastakshar kar rahe the
 After signing, the minister was stepping down from the dais to greet Gehlot
 is bich pratap singh khachariyavaas ko cabinet mantri kii shapath ke liye 13 cabinet mantriyon main se 12wein number par manch par bulaayaa gaya
 Pratap Singh signed and sat in the chair after taking the oath after the oath-taking ceremony and then first shook hands with Ashok Gehlot and turned around and reached Sachin Pilot on the other side of the chair
 khachariyavaas ne vahaan jaakar unka abhivadan kiya
 Seeing this view, Ashok Gehlot could not stop his smile
 isse pehle 11 cabinet mantriyon main se kisi ne bhi sachin payalat ke paas jaakar unka abhivadan nahin kiya tha
 Actually, Pratap Singh was the only one MLA who was openly seeking to make Sachin Pilot the Chief Minister
 baar-baar yah daleel de rahe the 5 saal tak jisane mehnat kii he kaman usee ke haath main honi chahie
 It is also believed that due to the stubbornness of Sachin Pilot, Pratap Singh Khachariwas, who won for the second time, has been made a cabinet minister
 ashok gahalot, pratap singh khachariyavaas ke bayaan par pehle bhi kehete aae hai ki pratap singh bade netaa he, jo kuch kaha hoga, soch kar kaha hoga
 But the way Pratap Singh went out of the way and greeted his beloved leader Sachin Pilot today, Gehlot could not stop smiling
 rajasthan ke siyaasi halke se lekar aam logon main charchaa he gahalot kii muskuraahat kya gul khilaaegi

 The conclave has been proving to be a big stage in deciding the condition and direction of the current situation
 haal hi main bijanour jile main thane ke nirikshan ke dauraan pulisavaalon kii pole khul gai
 Neither could he wield weapons nor could he name them
 lekin yogi ji ne uttar pradesh kii kaman apane haath main aate hi upi police ko oparation ''thok do'' par laga diya tha
 On the orders of Yogi ji, the police was also pushing the criminals
 hairaani kii baat ye he ki encounter karte vakt upi ke pulisavaalon kii naa to bandook funs rahi thi or naa hi aparaadhiyon kii jaan batch rahi thi
 It is about Bijnor district of western UP
 jahaan nazibabad thane main bijanour ke sio arun kumaar pahunche the
 Long before arrival, he also sent information that he was coming to inspect
 nirikshan kii shuruyaat ek daroga ji se hui
 Daroga ji was given a pellet gun and told to drive
 are ye kya ye miss ho gai
 CO Sabah shouted
 ek arse se sarkaar ne ye pallate gan thane ko di hui he
 The Divan Saheb of the police station also kept it safe
 par naa dewan sahab se matlab
 No means to inspector sir
 chal rahi he naukari
 Let it go
 thanedaar ne chalaai, lekin ye kya sahab phir kah rahe hai ki oh maai god
 Then she missed
 magar ab aglaa fire kaise karen
 Where will the bullet take place
 koi to bataa do
 Sahab said to the Thanedar, now put the gun down
 goli change karo
 Standing there watching all this, Diwan Saheb was like a respect
 unhone thanedaar se bandook chhini or khud nishaanaa lagane lage
 But what did the divan shoot, but he got angry
 ye khabar puraani he, par samajhane ke liye jaruri he
 This happened not once, but again and again
 jab mauka aayaa to bandook chali hi nahin
 However, government guns are also used for encounters
 jinke bal par hi upi police ne dhada-dhad encounter kiye
 Heaped many crooks
 kaiyon ko ghayal kar dhar dabocha
 Isn't it awesome? On one hand, the UP government guns did not work, and now suddenly the same guns were being fired
 ugale bhi kyon naa? jab trigar par oongli yogi ke farmaan kii ho or encounter sarkari aadesh to goliyaan to chalengi hi
 The question is: why suddenly there was an encounter in UP? Has the law system broken down in UP so much that there is no way other than an encounter? Have the criminal in UP become so uninspired that they suddenly become a threat to the entire society? Did the UP police become so helpless that it could not control crime? Or the government has chosen the easiest way to end the crime, then end the criminal itself
 par kya ye rasta sahi he? kya upi kii kanoon vyavastha ko sudhaarney ke liye encounter hi ekmaatr rasta or aakhri hathiyaar he? agar haa, to phir jab tak ye encounter jari he, tab tak ke liye kyon naa upi kii tamaam adaalaton par taala laga dena chahie? vaise bhi adaalaton kii jagah insaaf to ab sadak par hi ho rahaa he
 That too with bullets
 encounter yani muthbhed shabd kaa istemaal hindustan or pakistan main beesvin sadi main shuru hua
 An encounter directly means a police encounter with miscreants
 haalanki bahut se log encounter ko sarkari qatl bhi kehete hai
 The first encounter in India took place on 11 January 1982 at Mumbai's Wadala College, when a special team of Mumbai Police shot six bullets to gangster Manya Surve
 kehete hai ki police goli maarane ke baad use gaadi main daal kar tab tak mumbai kii sadakon par ghumaati rahi, jab tak ki wo mar nahin gaya
 After this he was taken to the hospital
 azaad hindustan kaa ye pehla encounter hi vivaadon main ghir gaya tha
 All these encounters raise questions as to why each of these encounters was done by announcing the declaration
 sutron ke mutabik upi estf or tamaam zila police ko baqayada ghoshit aparaadhiyon kii list bheji gai or usee list ke hisaab se upi main encounter jari hai
 Well, it is not known whether it would be coincidental or something that Yogi Adityanath himself had to seek protection for himself from UP government and UP police
 wo bhi sansad main
 He then cried foul, saying that the UP government was implicating him in false criminal cases
 lekin vakt badal chukaa he
 Now the same Yogi is the head of the UP government and the UP police is under him
 ab sangrakshan koi or maang rahaa he

 maine saare to nahin magar kai sau mail to padhe hi hai
 It is certain that private schools across the country have increased from 15 to 80 percent this year
 hyderabad ke ek skool ne 50 fisadi fis badha di he
 i am telling all this on the basis of email
 kya kisi mata-pita kii ek saal main selary itani badhati he
 a woman from Ghaziabad told that the fees of a child has increased to 60,000
 wo do bacchon kii fis nahin de sakati hai to soch rahi hai ki is saal ek kaa naam kataa den
 They have sixty thousand but not one lakh twenty thousand
 skulon ke kaaran middle class ke ye log paisa hote hue bhi garib ho gaye hai
 In view of our public hearing, many people's beliefs are awake
 ek juuta company ke vitarak ne bataaya ki siliguri se lekar raipur tak ke skulon main kyon mahange brands ke juute kareedne ke liye majaboor kiya ja rahaa he
 For example, Action Velcro and Sports Shoes cost 700 to 800 rupees
 company ne 40 fisadi margin par skool ko diya to 320 rupee hi kamayega
 The expensive brand shoes come in 2000, they also get a margin of 40 percent
 is hisaab se skool kii ek juute par 800 rupee kii kamai ho gai
 a black shoe is fine, but these are the robberies that you call the economy, forcing an expensive brand
 yahi nahin kai angrezi madhyam ke skulon main hindi bolne par bhi fine lagati he

 jurmaane kii koi raseed bhi nahin di gai he
 Measures have been taken to rob the people who are transferred
 raksha vibhaag ke adhikari ne mail kiya he ki tabadale ke kaaran unke bachche kaa admician duusare shahar ke skool main kara diya he
 But the old school also deposited the fees for April and May, when there was talk of giving the citation money
 do maheene se coshan mani bhi nahin mili he or nae skool main bhi unhen april-may kii fees deni padi he
 a school in Gurgaon refused to give a security deposit not disclosed two months ago
 yaheen ke ek skool ne transfar certificate dene ke liye teen maheene kii fis jamaa karaane ke liye kaha he
 To withdraw 15000 security money from a school in Dehradun, the parent had to spend 4000
 phir bhi das maheene ke intazaar ke baad 8,000 rupee hi mili, 7000 skool ne rakh liye

 Parents say there has been a 43 percent fee increase in four years
 deepies panipat ke 30 bacchon ke mata pita ne 27,900 rupee vaarshik shulk dene se inkaar kar diya magar un logon ne baaki fees yani 90,000 ke kareeb jamaa kara di thi
 The school kept this money but fired 12 protesting children
 maa baap ne iske khilaaf thane main shikaayat kar di
 No FIR has been filed yet
 maa baap ko skool ne bataaya he ki jab tak puri fees nahin bharenge tab tak in bacchon ko baithne nahin diya jayega
 The parents say that the annual annual charge is illegal inside Haryana, so they will not give an annual charge
 sarkaar chaahe to in bacchon ko dobaaraa skool bhejne ke aadesh de saktaa he magar koi karrwai nahin hui he
 The comments desh bhar main na jane kitne skulon ke kilaaf pradarshan chal rahe hai
 The parents have at least tried
 ab aate hai fees ko regulate karne ke kanoonon par
 Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have enacted such laws
 haryana main 1995 main kanoon bana tha jise 2005 main sanshodhan kiya gaya
 According to the proceedings report of the Commissioner of Rohtak Board on 16 February 2015, schools in Haryana have to fill Form 6 along with the audit report to increase the fees
 agar skool ko munaafaa hua he to fis vruddhi kii anumati nahin hoti he
 Annual charges, activity fees, smart class fees, computer fees are all forms of sub-capitation fees
 in madon main fees nahin lee ja sakati he
 Gujarat has fixed the maximum fee limit
 maharashtra main 2014 main kanoon bana tha
 It states that schools cannot increase fees on their own
 academik varsh shuru hone ke 30 din ke andar abhibhavak shikshak sangh banegaa
 All the parents will be its members, a committee will be formed about all of them
 is cameti main paas hue bina fees nahin bad sakati he
 Drafts have been made in many states, laws have been made elsewhere, but parents are troubled in every state
 jab bhi ye kanoon banate hai ham log bahut vaahvahee karte hai, lekin kabhi yah nahin dekhte ki inke bagair bhi fees badhati ja rahi he

 All political parties and leaders are engaged in protecting their supremacy
 varchasv kii is ladaai main congress ke diggaj netaa or purv kendriya mantri jitin prasad party netritv se naaraaz chal rahe hai
 It is believed that Jitin Prasad may leave the Congress and join the BJP
 atakalein hai ki prasad dhaurhara seat se bijepi ke ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 But the top leadership of the Congress is busy persuading them
 isi kram main sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne jitin prasad se mulaakaat kii he
 After the meeting, Jitin has two options
 pehla vikalp he ki jitin rajnath singh ke khilaaf lakhanu se chunaav laden or haarane kii sthiti main congress ne unhen rajyasabha main seat dene kaa bharosa diya he
 Jitin, who is angry, has another option to contest from Dhaurahara Lok Sabha seat
 to kya maan gaye jitin ?jitin prasad dhaurhara se chunaav nahin ladanaa chaahate
 They say that the Congress is fighting Muslim candidates from both the Lakhimpur Kheri and Sitapur seats around them
 prasad ko pataa chalaa he ki mahagathbandhan kii taraf se dhaurhara main muslim ummidavaar utaara jayega jisaki vajah se ilaake main hindu banaam muslim chunaav ho jayega or vah duusari baar bhi haar jaaenge
 That is why Jitin was pressurizing the Congress leadership to remove the Muslim candidate from either seat in Sitapur or Lakhimpur Kheri
 kyon canaphyus he congress?vartmaan sthiti ke mutabik jitin prasad yaa to lakhanu se chunaav laden or baad main haarane kii sthiti main rajyasabha main jaaen, yaa phir dhaurhara se chunaav main utren
 Because the Congress no longer wants to change any of the two Muslim candidates and send the wrong message across the state
 saath hi mushkil ye bhi he ki, sitapur kii purv saansad kaisar jahaan ko congress ne party main shaamil hi tikat dene kii shart par karaayaa tha, to vahiin duusari seat lakhimpur khiri ke ummidavaar 2009 main party tikat par jeet chuke hai
 If sources are to be believed, the Congress leadership believes that Jitin Prasad will be ready to contest from Lucknow
 bataa den ki dharauharaa seat 2009 main pehali baar vajood main ai thi or is seat par congress ke tikat se jitin prasad ne jeet darj kii thi
 But in 2014, BJP lost to Rekha Verma
 jitin prasad congress ke varisht netaa jitendra prasad ke bete hai

 Will Navjot Singh Sidhu, a minister and Congress leader in the Punjab government leave politics? After Amethi election results, such questions are becoming viral on social media
 darasal is sawaal kaa janm navjot singh siddhu ke 28 april 2019 ko ek bayaan se hua he
 The Congress has suffered a major setback in the Lok Sabha election results and the party president Rahul Gandhi himself has lost the election to Amethi
 amethi se rahul kaa chunaav haarana sabko hairaan kar rahaa he
 But the reality is that bjp's Smriti Irani has wrested the traditional Congress seat from Rahul Gandhi
 ab aate hai ki congress netaa navjot singh siddhu ke bayaan par, siddhu ne raibareli main sonia gandhi ke liye chunaav prachaar karte hue 28 april ko ek sabha main kaha tha ki agar rahul gandhi amethi se haar jate hai to vah raajnneeti chhod denge
 Sidhu was confident at the time and probably did not expect his statement to be overthrow within a month

 Questioning the bjp's slogan of no work during the 70 years of Congress rule, Sidhu had said that everything was made in the country under the Congress rule, from needle to ship to the country
 He rejected the claim that BJP candidate Smriti Irani is giving a thogh fight to Rahul Gandhi in Amethi

 History and Geography of marwarmarwad was a wide state of Rajasthan during the Mughal period
 marwar ko marusthal, marubhumi, marupradesh naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Geographically Marwar is surrounded by Bikaner in the north of Rajasthan, Jaipur, Kishangarh and Ajmer in the east, Ajmer and Udaipur in the south-east, Sirohi to Palanpur in the south and Jaisalmer in the north-west
 13veen shatabdi main rathod marwar praant main aae or apni veerta ke kaaran unhone yahaan apane rajya kii sthapana kii
 The original men of the Rathores of Marwar were "rao Siha", who set his foot on the land of Marwar around 1246
 isi vansh main raav ranmal ke putr jodha ne jodhpur kii sthapana 1459 main kii or mondor se hataakar nai rajdhani jodhpur ko banaaya
 Rao Jodha laid the foundation of a new citadel known as Mehran Garh and the city which settled in its foothills was known as Jodhpur to secure the new capital
 jodhpur par 1565 main mughalon kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 Rao Chandrasen of Jodhpur State met the Mughal ruler Akbar in 1570, but Akbar considered his rival brother Mota Raja Uday Singh as the ruler of the state of Jodhpur
 raav chandrasen niraash laut gaye or jeevanaparyant mughalon kaa virodh karata rahe
 In 1679, the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb attacked Marwar, looted it and forced its inhabitants to accept the religion of Islam, but the princely states of Jodhpur (marwar), Jaipur and Udaipur (mewar) formed an alliance and prevented control of the Mughals
 17veen sadi main aurangzeb ke samrajya main sakht niyantran ke baavjood, rathod parivaar kii is kshetra main ardh-swaittata jari rahi

 lekin iske pashchaat maan singh ke samay rajya sahaayak gathbandhan kaa hissaa bana or marwar (jodhpur) ke raja deshi riyasat ke rup main shashan karte rahe
 At the time of India's independence in 1947, the last ruler of the state of Jodhpur, Maharaja Hanwant Singh, delayed the signing of the proposal for merger with India
 jodhpur kii seemaa pakistan se lagi hone ke kaaran yahaan ke shaasha mohammad ali jinna se pakistan main vilay kaa sanket de chuke the
 But in the end they agreed to merge their kingdom into the Republic of India but after dramatic developments at the last minute
 marwar kaa raajnneetik itihashazadee ke baad desh main rajtantr samaapt hone ke baad loktantr kii sthapana hui
 Since the Rajputs were rulers and feudatories, the non-rajput castes continued to fall prey to their domination
 rajputon kii jagiradaari chhin jane ke baad rajasthan ke rajput congress ke ghor virdohi ho gaye jabaki jat, gurjar va anya jatiyaan congress kii samarthak ban gayi
 In Shekhawati, Marwar region of Rajasthan, the Jats together with the Congress governments brightened their politics
 samooche shekhavati, marwar ilaake main congress party ke tikat par jat vidhayak or saansad kaa chunaav jitate rahe
 In the politics of Rajasthan, Marwar, the largest region in terms of satraps of Marwar, got full representation in the politics of Rajasthan
 saath hi marwar ne pradesh ko kai diggaj netaa die
 Nathuram Mirdha, Parasaram Maderna, Khet Singh Rathore, Poonamchand Vishnoi, Ramsingh Vishnoi, Gangaram Chaudhary, Madho Singh Dewan were prominent among them
 ek samay tha jab in jananetaaon ke ishaare par marwar ke raajnneeti kii phija badal jaaya karti thi
 It was a miracle of Marwar's satraps when after the Emergency in 1977, the Congress swept across North India, but in Nagaur, Jat leader Nathuram Mirdha won all on his own and made everyone realize his strong hold
 marwar ke kshatrapon ke dam par hi apatkaal ke pashchaat hue vidhansabha chunaav main marwar kii 42 siton main se congress ne 26 siten jeet leen
 But there is a saying that grass cannot grow under the banyan, similarly the second line leaders could not flourish during these times
 jisaki vajah se inke avsaan ke saath hi kshatrapon kaa dabadabaa samaapt ho gaya
 The Congress had to bear the brunt of the absence of satraps
 congress ke puraane kshatrapon ne keval khud kii jati ko hi saath main nahin liya balki anya chote jati samoohon ko apane saath jode rakhaa
 He always benefited from this in elections
 kalantar main congress netaa ashok gahalot ne marwar ko apni karmbhumi ke liye chunaa or lagaataar is kshetra se jitate hue soobe ke do baar mukhyamantri rahe
 Gehlot could save his seat in the fierce anti-incumbency and Modi wave of 2013, but the BJP destroyed the stronghold of Marwar, the Congress
 marwar se bhaajapa main koi kaddavar kshatrap nahin hua or bhaajapa kii raajnneeti pehle bhaerosingh shekhavat or ab mukhyamantri vasudhanra raaje ke irdagird hi gumti he
 Representation of Marwar in Vasundhara and Central Government Marwar got representation in Vasundhara Government, under which Gajendra Singh Khivansar, Surendra Goyal, Pushpendra Singh, Amaram, Kamsa Meghwal and Ottaram Dewasi were made ministers in the government
 vahiin kendra kii modi sarkaar main bhi marwar kshetra se do mantri he
 Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Pali MP PP Chaudhary got a chance to become a minister in the Modi government
 yahi nahin marwar ko teen rajyasabha saansad mili
 Om Mathur, Ramnarayan Doody and Narayan Pancharia were sent to Rajya Sabha
 lihaaja bhaajapa ne congress ke haath se phisale marwar ko apane kabje main banaae rakhane ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi
 When the caste equations of the Congress were held in 2013, the magic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit the heads of the people in the 2013 assembly elections
 yahi kaaran rahaa ki saare jaateey sameekaran dhare rah gaye or pradesh main apane sabase majboot garh main congress chaaron khaane chit ho gai
 The Jat and Rajput societies, the largest ethnic group in Marwar, supported the BJP shoulder to shoulder
 in donon ko choti jatiyon kaa bharpoor samarthan mila or congress apana garh ganvaa baithi
 What is the situation now? Things have changed a lot in the last five years
 sthaneey vishleshkon kii maane to marwar main is baar kisi prakaar kii lahar najar nahin aa rahi
 In jat-rajput society, resentment towards the state government is evident
 saath hi kuch choti jatiyon main bhi apni upeksha ko lekar naaraazgi he
 In such a situation, there are few chances for Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje to be as enthusiastic as this Parivartan Yatra in this time of the yatra

 He said, 'as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, i have tried to connect with the six crore people of the state as much as possible
 ab mujhe rashtriya jimmedaari saunpi gayi he
 i will do my best to connect with 125 crore people
 yah meri jimmedaari kaa hissaa he or mujhe aisa karnaa hoga
 ' modi ne kaha, 'ho saktaa he ki 100 kadam chalanaa ho or main teen chal paaun, paanch chal paaun yaa saat kadam chal paau
 This is a different subject
 lekin yah meri jimmedaari he ki mujhe desh ke har naagarik tak, mere rajya ke har naagarik tak pahunchane ke liye pramanik prayaas karne chahie
 ' vah ek news channel ke kaarykram main sawaalon kaa jawaab de rahe the jahaan unhone muslim samudaay ke saath sampark saadhane ke apane prayaason kaa sanket diya
 When Modi was specifically asked if Muslims were involved in his efforts to reach every citizen, he said, "I am never going to go into this terminology
" aap rassi baandhakar mujhe le jaaoge to bhi nahin le ja paaoge
 i will meet my countrymen
 main ek hi bhashaa samajhataa hum ki ye mere bharatvasi hai, ye mere bhai hai
 The color you want to see, your choice
 modi us color main jane vaala nahin he
 ' unhone kaha, 'kal agar main chunaav haar jaaun to haar jaaun, mujhe koi dikkat nahin he
 But this language has destroyed the country, it has ruined the thinking of you, i will never accept that thinking and you please stop making such attacks on my freedom
 ' Modi was also placed before the Ram Temple and the issues of the Uniform Civil Code, which are considered to be the major reason for distance between BJP and Muslims
 unase poocha gaya ki kya vah apni tejatarraar chhavi ke chalate inhen puraa kar paaenge
 The Prime Ministerial candidate from the BJP made it clear that he would follow the Constitution on these subjects
 unhone kaha, 'desh tejatarrari se nahin chalata he
 The country runs by the constitution, the country follows the constitutional norms and the country is going to continue by the constitution itself
 tejatarraar to chunaavon ke liye hota he, desh chalaane ke liye nahin hota
 ' modi se yah bhi poocha gaya ki kya pradhanmantri ke taur par unke kaamkaaj main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii chhap dikhaai degi kyonki bachapan se unka judaav is sanghathan se rahaa he
 In response, the Chief Minister of Gujarat said, 'first thing is i have to run the government
 sarkaar samvidhan ke tahat chalati he or main maanata hum ki sarkaar kaa ek hi dharm hota he-india first
 The government has only one holy book - our Constitution
 sarkaar kii ek hi bhakthi hoti he-bharat bhakthi or sarkaar kii ek hi kaaryastylee hoti he-sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas
 ' jab 2002 ke dangon kii baat ai to modi ne kaha ki vah sab kasautiyon se nikle hai or aage bhi har kasuti ke liye taiyaar hai
 But will never succumb to lies and political motives
 unhone kaha, 'maine 2007 tak har sawaal kaa har samay jawaab diya he
 If you feel bad or feel good and you want me to pressurize you then it is not going to happen
 ' Attacking the UPA government, Modi said that the UPA "conspired and dragged me to the courts, to the Supreme Court
" phir mujhe laga ki ab mujhe kuch nahin bolnaa chahie kyonki ucchtam nyaayalay ko influence nahin hona chahie
 ' unhone adhikariyon dwaara is maamle main unase hui poochtacha kaa bhi zikr kiya
 Modi said, 'to date, a Chief Minister of India has been questioned by a policeman for nine hours? It is the Chief Minister who was questioned by the police officer for nine hours
 ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh par yah kiya gaya tha
 i have come out of all these criteria and am ready for every criterion even further
 ' When Modi was asked about his party leader Giriraj Singh's statement that 'those opposing Modi should move to Pakistan', the Prime Ministerial BJP candidate said, 'no one can agree with this
 ' He said, 'after winning the 2002 election, i went to Maninagar to thank my voters
 us din maine apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki yah sarkaar unki he jinhone vot diya he, yah sarkaar unki bhi he jinhone virodh main matdaan kiya he, yah sarkaar unki bhi he jo vot dene nahin gaye
 ' sonia gandhi ke damaad robert wadra par jameen saudon main kathith gadabadi ke maamle main karrwai ko lekar bhaajapa netaaon ke alag-alag tarah ke vichaaron ke bare main puche jane par modi ne saaf kiya ki vah aise muddon kii jagah vikaas par dhyaan denge or is tarah ke vishyon se kanoon ke anusaar nipta jayega
 He said, 'we come for five years and in these five years, they will roam around with garbage or do something good
 meri vyaktigat raay he ki meri shakti is kooday-karkat main nahin jaae
 My strength should be spent on positive work, doing good
 varanaa paanch saal kaa samay bahut kam hota he
 If we remain entangled in it, what will the nation do? ' Referring to his tenure of so many years as Chief Minister, Modi said, 'my 14 years of experience show that i have never opened anyone's file
 meraa mat rahaa he ki agar main usamen ulajh jaataa to usamen ghusata hi chalaa jaataa
 i could not do any good work
 14 saal main maine keval sakaaratmak chizon par hi dhyaan diya he
 i do not even know old things
 ' He also said that no one is above the law
 maan lijie narendra modi par koi iljaam ho or kal maano vah pradhanmantri ban jaaen to kya un par maamla nahin chalanaa chahie kyonki vah pradhanmantri ban gaye
 This should not happen
 vadodara loksabhaa seat par modi ke namakan ke dauraan jamaa kiye gaye halafname main vaivaahik sthiti kii jaankaree par uthe vivaad ke sambandh main jab unase poocha gaya ki kya unhen is vishay par aalochana hone kii ummid thi to unhone kaha, 'mujhe kisi cheez kaa aashcharya nahi hota he or meri jindagi main kuch nahin he
 Such things also go on
 ab unke (virodhiyon ke) paas koi vishay nahin he to kya karen, ve yahi karte rahenge
 ' darasal modi ne pehali baar apane halafname main shaadishuda hone kii baat sweekaar kii he jis par unki aalochana ho rahi he

 Targeting the BJP, Aam Aadmi Party's Delhi election in-charge Sanjay Singh said, "bjp's anti-aam Aadmi policy has been exposed
 bhaajapa ne ghoshnaa kii he ki agar satta main aae to kejariwal sarkaar kii 200 unit muft bijli yojana ko khatm kar denge
 This intention of the BJP has been highlighted by his Rajya Sabha member Vijay Goel
 'bhaajapa garibon kii virdohi he jo bhi kaam@arvindkejriwalgaribom ke liye karte hai bhaajapa unka virodh karti he, dilli sarkaar ne 200 unit bijli free kari to bhaajapa kaa saansad kahata he ham sarkaar main aaenge to ise khatm kar denge jabaki har saansad ko 5000 unit har maheene free bijli milti he

 If you are getting 200 units of electricity for free, then you are announcing to end it
 janata aisi party ko kabhi maaf nahin karegi
 The public has made up its mind that the 200-unit free power scheme will continue and the Aam Aadmi Party government will return strongly
 'aam aadmi party netaa sanjay singh ne sawaal poochhate hue kaha, 'bhaajapa vaale bataaen ki kya kabhi bhi kisi bhi rajya main garibon ko raahat di he? kyon 5
 50 million crores of capitalists forgiven? 10
 50 lakh karod enpie ho gaye or uski bharpai ke liye arabiai se 1 lakh 76 hajaar karod kyon liye gaye? agar kejariwal sarkaar sasti bijli de rahi he, to kya vot kharid rahe hai? agar garib ko raahat de rahe hai to kya vot kharid rahe hai?'vahiin duusari taraf dilli main sabsidi khatm karne vaale bayaan par bijepi netaa vijay goyal ne palatwaar kiya he
 He said, 'to end the subsidy or not it will depend on our government
 vahiin vijay goyal ne daawa kiya he ki agar hamaari sarkaar satta main aati he to dilli kii janata ko ham kejariwal sarkaar se sasti bijli uplabdh karaayenge
 Formula for cheap electricity: Vijay Goyal introduced a formula to provide cheap electricity in Delhi
 unhone kaha, 'bijli companiyon main compatishan karaayenge saath hi solar panel kaa zyada se zyada implement karenge taaki bijli kii demand kam ho or supplai zyada ho jisase sasti bijli milegi
 Every person has the right to cheap electricity
 iske saath hi centre sarkaar kii tamaam yojanaon ko bhi dilli main lagu karenge
 In a clear attack on Kejriwal, Goyal said that Kejriwal government has not implemented any central government scheme in Delhi
 kejariwal sarkaar garibon kii dost nahin dushman hai
 Kejriwal government wants to garner votes by doing free electricity tax 2 months before the elections
 agar dilli kii sarkaar ko vaaki hamadardi hoti to vah 5 saal free bijli detii
 Whatever scheme BJP will bring will come from the beginning of 5 years
 'aage unhone kaha, 'sabsidi hataane kaa koi matlab hi nahin hota, sasti bijli dena hota he
 Electricity companies are putting tax money from one pocket into another pocket
 vahiin hamaari jab sarkaar aegi or hamaari jo bhi yojana hogi chaahe vah muft kii ho yaa sasti bijli kii ho, vah puure 5 saal ke liye hogi naa ki chunaavon se pehle 2 maheene tak ke liye

 As soon as PMO India tweeted a statement on Kashmir in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mind on Sunday, former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid wrote on it, 'modi devotees, one more slap? Now understand
 ' iske baad ajtak ne congress netaa salmaan khurshid se kashmir or unke twit par khaas baatcheet kii, pesh hai baatcheet ke mukhya ansh
 Why did you attack his supporters on what the PM said on Kashmir? Salman Khurshid- Yes i said but the truth is what we have been saying for a long time, he has now been able to understand the Prime Minister
 jo ham kehete the pradhanmantri ab jaakar vah bole hai
 Therefore, i want to say that in the violence that took place in Jammu and Kashmir, we were accused that we made rhetoric by associating the martyrdom of the security personnel with the killed youth
 lekin us vakt hamako nishane par liya gaya
 So today, when the Prime Minister said that i am sorry for the loss of life of the security personnel as well as the common people, i was very relieved
 maine bhi pehle yahi kaha tha jiske liye mujhe desh virdohi qaraar de diya gaya
 Not only this, on Twitter, i was called not only a traitor, but also a Pakistan Sympathesizer
 tabhi maine likhaa kii tamaacha to modi samarthakon par he, jo main pehle kahata tha vah aaj modi ji ne kah diya
 Thanks to Modi ji
 ummid he isi line par aage badhenge
 But now where is the Modi devotee who used to insult me when i used to say what Modi ji said today
 aaj bharat sarkaar apni niti ke lihaaj se aage bad rahi he, kya aapako lagata he is maukey par hurriyat se baatcheet honi chahie?salmaan khurshid- pradhanmantri or grahamantrihurriyat se baatcheetke sawaal par saaf saaf kuch nahin bolte, par pradhanmantri se mil kar mukhyamantri mehabooba, algaavvaadiyon ke varisht netaa gilaani ko apana pita samaan bataati hai, shanti main saath maangati he, par sawaal ye uthta he kii bharat sarkaar kii ore se abhi tak ye elaan nahin hua kii sab se baatcheet main kya hurriyat bhi he? vaise koi nayaa formula kashmir mudde ko hal karne kaa modi ji ke paas he to wo saarvjaanik karen, desh hit main congress saath degi, lekin afsos is baat kaa he kii shuruyaat main jab ham kehete hai to hame anti-neshnal kaha jaataa he, or baad main hamaari line ko apana liya jaataa he
 Is this our embarrassment or Prime Minister weak information of your advisors? Yes we are happy that finally you started saying and doing what we used to say
 isliye main kahata hum, kii modiji to samaj gaye, par modi ke bhakt or sipaahi nahin samaj paa rahe
 Whether the Hurriyat should be discussed on Kashmir issue or not? Salman Khurshid - We will say that after fifty days of curfew there should be peace in Kashmir
 We are keeping it, but whether they will also adopt the strategy, we do not know
 par yah jarur he kii aaj bhi vahi ranneeti kaamyaab hogi jo manmohan singh ji or atal ji ne istemaal kii thi
 The question is that today's government does not even tell in the all-party meeting what formula it has for solving the Kashmir issue
 abhi tak to kuch saaf najar nahin aata
 This is why 50 days have passed, there is curfew in Kashmir and after so many days the Prime Minister is giving a statement
 ab jaakar yah sahi bayaan he lekin itane dinon baad kyon
 After all, what strategy were you adopting earlier, which was increasing fire in Kashmir
 khayr der aae durust aae
 For the homeless people living in Balochistan Gilgit and pok are forced to live in Jammu, Kathua and around, what is the meaning of this, Government of India announced 2000 crore fund? Salman Khurshid - India has always been open to Hindu refugees
 yah pehle se sarkaron kaa vaada rahaa he
 Now this government should tell what is the record of the people it is talking about
 jaanch padtaal kahaan tak pahunchi he, kya hadtaal sahi he? ham yah kahana chaahate hai ki hindu sharnaarthiyon ke liye upie sarkaar ne hi daravaaje khol kar rakhe the, isliye nayaa kya kiya ja rahaa he yah khulkar sarkaar sab ko bataaen
 We will also take the matter right and stand with the government
 kyonki kashmiri pandit jo desh ke kashmir main rahakar desh ke vibhinn ilaakon main rah rahe hai unki pareshaani unka punarvaas hamaari praathamikta he
 But the question is that instead of taking any serious steps about them, the Modi government is trying to politics by the name of pok Gilgit Balochistan
 bharat sarkaar kii kashmir niti kaa samarthan karte hai yaa congress party modi kii kashmir niti ke saath he?salmaan khurshid- ham to manmohan singh or atal bihari vaajapeyi ke formule par aage badhanaa chaahate hai ham usee ke saath hai lekin agar modi sarkaar ke paas agar koi nayaa formula he to saamne lekar aaen
 The Congress party will stand together in the interest of the country, but sadly, no formula has come out officially, so we just say that before taking any step in haste and arrogance, we should take serious steps in the matter of Kashmir
 
 congress party se salaah lee jaaegi to desh hit main vah hameshaa saath degi lekin jo sawaal saamne hai kii ranneeti saamne laane main itani deree kyon or doosraa yah ki aaj jo aap kah rahe hai usee ranneeti par aage bade
 The Congress party is with every step of the Modi government in the national interest

 Oddly enough, the hunger for education in the children of this village in Jamui district on the border of Giridih in Jharkhand and Nawada district of Bihar is pervasive
 aathvin kii chaatra renu kahati he, ''meri badi bahan or bhai padhai nahin kar sake
 i want to fill this gap by becoming a teacher
 '' gaanv main log shiksha ko lekar jaagruk hue hai
 But his expectations from the misdeeds of Naxalites seem to be shattering
 shikshak skool jane se kataraate najar aate hai
 One such teacher Vijay Kumar is working in the block on deputation
 khaas baat yah he ki naksaliyon ne zyaadaatar un skulon ko uda diya he, jinka istemaal police camp or matdaan centre ke rup main kiya gaya
 As the teacher of the Channavar incident, Sudama Bhakta, points out, "the Maoists' outrage was over the police camp in the school
" un logon ne gaanvvaalon ko yah chetavanee dekar skool ko uda diya ki yahaan dobaaraa camp na lage
 Not only this, Naxalites have also blown up two-storey school buildings for security reasons
 aarthik sansadhano par hamale ke iraade se bhi skool unke nishane par rahete hai
 The locals are stuck in strange hikes
 unhen naksaliyon ke skool imaaraton ko nasht karne kaa virodh karne par jaan kaa khatra he to police camp kaa virodh karne par naksali samarthak hone kaa aarope lagane kaa dar
 Because of this, they become compulsive spectators to see everything happening
 donon hi halaat main asar bacchon kii shiksha par pad rahaa he
 The administrative helplessness is evident in the reconstruction of the broken buildings of the schools
 isi vajah se dhwast hui zyaadaatar imaaraten jyon kii tyon padi hai
 However, the government has ordered not to set up police camps in schools
 magar sthaneey logon kaa kahana he ki jab bhi naksaliyon ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaae jate hai tab vyavhaar main us nirdesh kaa paalan nahin ho paata
 Bihar Director General of Police Abhayanand told India Today, "now there is no school in the state where there is a police camp
" skulon se police shiviron ko quarteron main shift kar diya gaya he
 On the other hand, the Senior Citizens Association considers a different reason for the attack on schools
 sangh ke purv rashtriya upaadhyaksh shrinandan sharma kehete hai, ''ashiksha or garibi hi naksaliyon kaa aadhaar rahe hai
 They are afraid that when people go to school, they will lose their grip in the area
 lihaaja, yah police se ranjish ke naam par bacchon ko shiksha se vanchit rakhane kaa kuchakr he
 "the ground reality is that in Naxalite attacks, more people are being harmed by those whom they claim to be friendly
" pichley hafte patna main kendriya grih sachiv aar
 K
 singh ne bhi yahi baat kahi, ''garibon or adivaasiyon kii suraksha ke naam par naksaliyon ne ab tak sabase zyada unheen kii hatya kii he or unhen har tarah se kshati pahunchaai he
 The Union Home Ministry has also approved 400 anti-naxal police stations in nine Naxal-affected states to overcome this problem
 inamen 85 bihar ke liye hai jo duusare kisi bhi rajya kii tulana main sarvaadhik he
 Two crore in the construction of each police station
 kharch honge
 Channavar Jamui is not the only school
 jile ke khera block ke gadhi, sono block ke bhalsudhiyaan, mahesri, sarkanda, charaka pathar, barhat block ke chormara or gurmaha skool naksaliyon ke hamale kaa shikaar ho rahe hai
 The situation in Channavar is a hallmark of understanding the difficulties of the children of the demolished schools 
 bihar main pichley chah saal main jamui ke alaava baankaa, munger, aurangabad, gaya, camoor, jahanabad, mujffarpur, pashchimi champaran or purvi champaran jaise naksal prabhavit jilon ke 46 skool nishaanaa bane hai
 If seen, a government school has been demolished on an average of one and a half months
 kendriya grih mantralay kii report ke mutabik, 2006 se november 2011 tak desh ke 258 skulon ko uda diya gaya, jisamen bihar ke 46 skool shaamil hai
 Naxalites demolished 131 schools in Chhattisgarh, 63 in Jharkhand and 46 in Bihar, the number of schools in Bihar being slightly lower during this period
 lekin khaas yah ki rajya desh ke un chaar naksal prabhavit rajyon chhattisgarh, jharkhand, orissa kii qatari main aa gaya he, jinamein is tarah kii ghatnaon main ijapha hua he
 Measures are being taken to deal with the circumstances arising out of such incidents
 kendriya janajati kalyaan kaary mantralay ne naksal prabhavit or ati pichhadaa kshetra ke anusuchit jati or janajati varg ke bacchon kii shiksha ke liye ashram skool kholane kaa faisla kiya he
 Under this, residential schools in Jamui, Rohtas, Bhabhua, Munger, Banka, Nawada and Gaya will be opened in the state
 lekin ise ek lambii prakriya mana ja rahaa he, jisamen samay lagegaa
 Bihar Police has again started a campaign to connect unaccompanied children to the school, but linking them to the schools without building is an important question
 baharhaal, kaaran jo bhi ho, skulon par naksali hamalon kii ghatana, or uske baad kii paristhitiyaan yah sochane ko majaboor karti hai ki kya nanheen ankhon kaa sunahare khwab dekhnaa gunaah he

 notebandi ke baad sarkaar zyada se zyada cashles tranjection ko badhaava de rahi he
 People are being asked to transact with e-wallet, paytm, debit / credit card
 lekin dilli ke zyaadaatar aspataalon main abhi tak cashles pement nahin ho paaya he
 37 days after demonetisation, AIIMS and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital are now preparing to be cashless
 cashles vyavastha kaa jayja lene ke liye 'ajtak' kii team ram manohar lohia aspataal pahunchi
 There are a total of 5 counters of cash at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in the heart of New Delhi
 isamen 23 number kaa counter wo, jahaan sabase zyada cash pement lee jaati he
 Cash is collected from one to one and a half to 2 lakhs in a day, but surprisingly, this counter does not have a swipe machine or online banking facility
 net banking se pement le rahe aspatalram manohar lohia aspataal ke acount officer parminder ne 'ajtak' ko bataaya ki bharat sarkaar ke niyam aane ke baad hamane bank ko likhaa or ab tamaamcash counterpar 7 swip mashin lagaai ja rahi hai
 Apart from that, we have started taking payments from net banking
 mobile par m-clip aplication downlod kii he
 This allows any patient to transfer directly to a bank account
 abtak bank main cash jamaa hota tha, lekin ab sab kuch cashles ho rahaa he
 After this claim of no swipe machine administration at many counters, we reached the most busy cash counter of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital
 yahaan kaisier vinod ne bataaya kionline bankingke liye card lekar kai log aate hai
 Around 400 patients visit during the day
 bahut se logon ke paas cash nahin hota or wo card istemaal karne ko kehete hai
 Vinod said that the swipe machine has been installed on the number 2 counter, but it is yet to be installed here
 is padtaal ke baad hamaari team ram manohar lohia aspataal ke counter number 2 par pahunchi, jahaan aspataal prashasan ne swip mashin lagane kaa daawa kiya tha
 The swipe machine was kept in this counter
 kaisier ne bataaya ki 250 se 1000 rupee tak kii pement is counter par hoti he
 20 to 25 patients of online banking now come here and the use of swipe machine has increased considerably
 marijon ne kaha-100 fisadi ho online bankinaalanki, marijon kaa maananaa he ki aspataal ab bhi onlinebankingke liye taiyaar nahin ho paae hai

 i had to take 1000 rupees medicine, but did not have a swipe machine, then had to go back
 phir kisi ne cash dekar madad kii tab dawaai kharidi
 First of all, online banking should be provided in the hospital
 aspataal staff ko plastic mani kii jaankaree nahinkishor vasudhanra se apane rishtedaar kaa ilaaj karaane pehle ames gaye the or ab ram manohar lohia aae hai
 Both places are worried about not having online banking
 aspataalon main plastic mani kii mashin hi nahin he or inke staff ko bhi iske bare main jaankaree nahin he
 First it takes 10 minutes to explain them, then their net does not run or the server goes down
 bina cash ke kaam karnaa mushkil he
 It is not possible for everyone to use plastic money, but sadly, the government has not been able to make any arrangements so far
 zaahir he ram manohar lohia aspataal centre sarkaar ke adheen he
 This is the reason that the administration has a serious look for cashless banking here
 ram manohar lohia aspataal main doctor apane tamaam staff ko online banking or cashles mani kii training bhi de rahe hai
 The administration claims that due to the branch of Bank of Baroda inside the hospital, the facility of online banking is being provided strongly

 Delhi Development Minister Gopal Rai spoke of emphasizing social awareness on air pollution
 diwali par pataakhon se nikle dhune par baat karte hue unhone kaha ki isko lekar sarkaar or sansthaaen kaam kar rahi hai

 After the death of Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, his daughter and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti is now ready to become the new Chief Minister of the state
 mahabuuba aaj hi mukhyamantri pad kii shapath le sakati hai
 BJP, a partner in the state government, has also agreed to this
 guuruuvaar ko dilli ke ames main bhartee 79 varshiya mufti mohammad said kaa nidhan ho gaya tha
 Although earlier it was being said that after 4 days of mourning, Mehbooba will take oath as Chief Minister
 pidipi ne governor ko bheja patraguruuvaar ko pidipi ke varisht netaa mujffar hossain beg or altaaf bukhari ne iske liye governor enen vohara ko wo patr saunp diya, jisamen pidipi ne mahabuuba ko pidipi kaa mukhiya chunaa he
 Sources in the PDP said that in this letter, the governor has been asked to take oath after the funeral of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed
 mufti mohammad said kaa guuruuvaar shaam unke paitruk kasbe bijabehaara main supurd-e-khaak kar diya gaya
 The governor has to decide when he will administer the oath of caretaker chief minister to Mehbooba and within fifteen days of the swearing in, he will be asked to prove his majority in the assembly
 jammu kashmir kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri hongi mahabuubashapath lete hi mahabuuba jammu kashmir kii pehali mahila mukhyamantri ban jaaengi
 Earlier, in response to a question related to handing over the command to Mehbooba, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed himself had said recently that Mehbooba would definitely take over this responsibility if the party wants to
 pichley dinon said kii sharaab swasthya ke kaaran bhi mahabuuba ko siem banane sambandhi report lagaataar aa raheen thim
 BJP sources had also indicated that Saeed's daughter Mehbooba Mufti could be the coalition's first choice as the CM of Jammu and Kashmir
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi ko mahabuuba ke siem banane se koi aapatti nahin he, lekin unke siem banane par bijepi mantrimandal main kuch pherbadal karnaa chaahegi
 Senior PDP leader Naeem Akhtar had also said that there could be a consensus on Mehbooba Mufti if it comes to making someone else in the state as CM
 rajya ke nae siem ke sawaal par unhone kaha tha, 'philhal aisi koi sambhaavna nahin he

 ' sachin tendulkar 24 saalon se cricket khel rahe hai, lekin unki patni anjali kaa kahana he ki sachin ke sanyas ke baad ghar main kaaphi kuch badalane ja rahaa he
 Referring to the importance of the game for her husband, Anjali said that Sachin has always worshiped cricket and when he is going to leave cricket, this moment is very emotional for the whole family, not just for Sachin
 anjali ne kaha, main sachin ke bina cricket kii kalpana to kar sakati he, lekin cricket ke bina sachin kii kalpana kar paanaa asambhav he
 He said, i do not know what will make a place in his life after cricket
 anjali ne yah bhi kaha ki vankhede stadium main apane kariyar ke 200wein test ke baad sanyas ke faisle or aage ke bhavishya ke bare main sachin ne unase charchaa kii thi
 Anjali said, Sachin always kept saying that on the day he feels that he is not able to give his 100 percent, then it will be time (of retirement)
 
 
 ek din unhone mujhase kaha or faisla kar liya
 Anjali said, i have never seen Sachin walk away from cricket for a moment
 jab ham england main chhuttiyaan manaa rahe hote hai, tab bhi vah cricket ke mood main hote hai
 He is very conscious about the game and never eats too much
 anjali ne kaha ki unke pati bhaawanaaon ko chupaane main kaaphi aage hai or is baat kii bahut kam hi ummid he ki vah sanyas lene ke saath apni bhaawanaaon ko khud par haaavee hone kaa mauka denge
 It is a different matter that Sachin became emotional after winning the World Cup and his eyes were filled at that time

 britain main jhooth bolne ke kaaran vahaan kii aantarik suraksha mantri amber rud ko istipha de dena padaa
 She lied to the parliamentary committee that her government had not set any goal of expelling emigrants who had come from outside, but when the Guardian newspaper published a letter written by them in which they are telling Prime Minister Therisa that the immigrant It is not difficult to remove
 jhooth pakadaa gaya to mantri ji ko istipha de dena padaa
 While she was doing very important work and was considered close to the Prime Minister
 bharat main kya aisa hota he? abhi haal hi main aapane aadhaar maamle main ek report padhi hogi
 When the Supreme Court asked the government when we said that it is mandatory to link the mobile number with Aadhaar
 jabaki sitambar 2017 main kendiy mantri ravishankar prasad ne twit kiya tha ki supreme court kaa aadesh he ki mobile number ko aadhaar se link karnaa he
 When asked by the Supreme Court why it was said in the telecom department circular that the Supreme Court has said that the mobile SIM has to be linked to Aadhaar
 tab sarkaar ke pratinidhi vakil kuch or safai dene lage
 The minister did not even express regret over the lie he had told in his tweet
 yah bharat he
 Here lies only lies
 bhagwaan, allaah, god sab maaf kar dete hai
 On the evening of May 1, news channels like Prime Minister's 15 minutes vs
 Rahul's 15 minutes will be running
 karnataka chunaavon ke antim charan main dhuandhar raily kii shuruyaat karte hue pradhanmantri modi ne kaha he ki karnataka main aapako jo bhashaa pasand ho, us bhashaa main, hindi bol saken to hindi, angrezi bol sakate hai to angrezi
 If you speak your mother's mother tongue then mother tongue
 aap 15 minute haath main kaagaj liye bina karnataka main apni sarkaar kii achievement karnataka kii janata ke saamne bol dijie
 Please mention the name of Mr
 Visvesaraya ji at least 5 times during the 15 minute speech
 bas media main heldine bich gai ki modi ne diya jawaab rahul ko
 Did give exactly but what Rahul said
 23 april ko rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki neerav modi ji kaa maamla he, lalit modi kaa maamla he, vijay maalya kaa maamla he, rafel kaa maamla he, narendra modi parliament main khadey hone se ghabaraate hai
 i am telling you 15 minutes, make me speak there, 15 minutes make me speak in front of Modi ji, i will talk about Rafael in 15 minutes, i will talk about Nirav Modi, Modi ji will not be able to stand there
 hamane donon ke bayaan kareeb-kareeb hu-ba-hu padhe hai
 Now you see the difference
 rahul ne kaha ki rafel maamla, lalit modi or neerav modi ke maamle main modi ji 15 minute bhi nahin tik paaenge
 The Prime Minister did not say anything on this challenge of Rahul, took 15 minutes and kept his 15 minutes and his own conditions
 tivi ke liye isse acha masala kya ho saktaa he
 If you look at the statements of both of them carefully, they are going to clap
 jaise cinema main pehle front stall ke liye kuch seen hote the, ection seen aate hi tali baj jaati thi
 This is the difference you have to understand
 na to rahul gandhi apni sarkaar kii uplabdhi par 15 minute bolenge or na hi pradhanmantri neerav modi, rafel vimaan samjhauta par 15 minute
 But 15 minutes vs 15 minutes headline will be served in front of you in the media and in all the Hindi newspapers of tomorrow
 aapako bhi ipel match kii tarah khel se zyada tamaashe par mazaa aayega
 TV likewise makes you a viewer, makes the issue disappear and serves entertainment in front of you in the name of the issue
 tivi kaa charitra hi yahi he
 This used to happen earlier also, this is happening today and the same will happen tomorrow
 tivi ke sawaal aapke sawaal bana die jaaenge
 You will forget your question
 koi bhi is sawaal par bahes nahin karegaa ki pension ko lekar congress or bijepi kii kya raay he
 What kind of debate is there between them, what is the debate between the Congress and BJP about the salary of the bank employees, their working condition, what is the debate between the Congress and the BJP on the basis
 jab tak aap darshak samooh kaa hissaa hai, kisi bheed kaa hissaa hai aapako vaaki mazaa aayega ki rahul gandhi ne nahala maaraa to modi ne bhi dahala maar diya
 This happened six jaise hi aap bheed yaa samooh se alag hokar saath saal kii conso devi kii tarah alag hote hai, aap akele pad jate hai
 The system breaks you down so much that neither Congress nor BJP comes, to help you
 conso devi dur daraaj ke gaanvon main nahin rahati hai balki dilli main rahati hai
 The widow was getting pension after her husband's death but suddenly stopped
 wo teen saal ye yahi jaanane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai ki unki pension kyon band hui
 He sought information under Right to Information to find out why the pension of 1500 rupees was discontinued
 chaar saal biit gaye tab central information kamishnar ne aadesh diya ki galati conso devi kii nahin he, adhikariyon kii he
 But even after this Kanso Devi did not get pension nor was the authorities fined
 conso devi kii yah haalat kyon hui, kyonki soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat soochna dilaane kii javabdehi jin sansthaaon ko di gai he, un sansthaaon kii imaaraten to hai magar unamem ayukta nahin hai
 On 6 March, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the five-star headquarters of the Central Information Commissioner in Munirka, South Delhi
 udghaatan ke vakt media report main is paanch manzila imaarat ko state of di art building or paryaavaran ke anukool bataaya gaya
 But in the State of the Art Building, built at a cost of 60 crores, see the state art that there should be 11 commissioners but four posts are vacant
 is saal ke ant tak chaar or ritair ho jaaenge, jinamein mukhya soochna ayukta bhi hai
 If you go to the Prime Minister's website, then there is a very beautiful thing written that only through transparency can people be given equal status
 iske baad bhi yahaan 11 ke 11 soochna ayukta nahin hai
 If the building was a little less beautiful, not even the State of the Art and there would have been 11 commissioners, a woman like Kanso Devi would not have had to travel four years to get information about her pension
 ab sochie kendriya soochna ayukta ke mukhyalay kaa yah haal he to rajyon main kya hoga
 The report of Hridayesh Joshi states that there are many states in the country where there is not a single commissioner in the information commissioner's office
 kya yah desh kii zanta ke saath mazaaq nahin he
 According to the rule, 11 information commissioners can be appointed in every state in view of population and pending cases
 andhra pradesh ko bane hue chaar saal ho gaye magar yahaan ek bhi ayukta nahin he
 Many states of Kerala and North East have only one commissioner
 himachal pradesh or jharkhand main to keval do hi soochna ayukta hai
 There are three Information Commissioners in Gujarat, Goa and Assam
 yahaan bhi 8 pad khaali hai
 There are only 4 Information Commissioners in Bihar, 7 posts are vacant here too
 soochna kaa adhikaar koi saamaanya adhikaar nahin he
 When officers do not work for the public without talking, then the public defends themselves by resorting to this law
 lekin agar rajyon se lekar dilli tak ayukta hi nahin honge to us garib janata kaa kya hoga jo pension, rashan yaa anya tarah kii sarkari madad ke liye yahaan se vahaan bhatak rahi hoti he
 35-year-old Reena is from the scheduled caste
 talakshuda hai
 Three children are together
 unhen skool bhejnaa he
 Caste certificate is required to reduce fees
 dilli ke dakshinpuri kii hai
 The revenue department has said that the father certificate of the children is also required
 ab wo kya kar rahi hai, wo siaisi gayi
 RTI applied
 do saal ho gaye, abhi tak yah nahin bataaya ki prakriya kya he
 If you ask for information under Right to Information, then you are not giving information for two years
 jab raajnneetik dal, media koi saath nahin detaa he tab isi artiai ke sahare ye saadhaaran janata apane haq kii ladaai lard rahi hoti he
 According to the report of the vigilante civic organization, more than 2 lakh appeals are pending only in the information commissions
 iske aadhaar par andaaza lagaaya gaya ki desh ke tamaam vibhaagon main 50 lakh se zyada maamle lambit ho sakate hai
 Meaning that information is not being given or there is a delay in giving it
 satark naagarik sanghathan kaa anumaan he ki bengal kii haalat yah he ki vahaan agar aap aaj artiai lagaayenge to chalis saal baad aapaki apil kaa nipataara hoga
 The comments 6 march ko jab dilli main kendriya soochna ayukta ke mukhyalay kaa udghaatan kiya gaya tha tab di print naam kii website ne ek report chhaapi thi ki do saal se ayuktaon kii niyukti nahin hui he
 In September 2016, advertisements for two posts came out but no one was appointed
 6 march ko mukhyalay ke udghaatan ke vakt pradhanmantri modi ne kaha tha ki 'system main jitani zyaada paardarshita badhati he, soochna kaa pravaah aasaan hota he, utana hi logon kaa sarkaar par bharosa badhata he
 Of course, the National Information Commission has also played an important role in this flow of information
 jab pradhanmantri bhi maanate hai ki soochna kaa pravaah aasaan hoga to logon kaa sarkaar par bharosa badhegaa phir conso devi jaisi mahila ko soochna paane main chaar saal kyon lag rahe hai
 Why the Commissioners have been vacant in the CIC headquarters for two years
 yahi nahin, media report padhenge to pradhanmantri karyaalay se artiai ke tahat jo soochna maangi jaati he usamen se badi sankhya main jawaab nahin milti he, yahi miltaa he ki jaankaree jamaa kii ja rahi he
 In the final phase of the Karnataka elections, Prime Minister Modi said that in the language you like in Karnataka, if you can speak Hindi, then you can speak Hindi, then you can speak English
 aapaki mataji kii maatrubhaasha bolte hai to maatrubhaasha
 Without taking the paper in your hands for 15 minutes, you should tell your government's achievement in Karnataka in front of the people of Karnataka
