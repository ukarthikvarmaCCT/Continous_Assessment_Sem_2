 There is a severe downfall of higher education, from the Center to all the State Governments treating higher education like a sheep goat
 profasaron ne dashakon pehle class lenaa chhod diya tha
 Except a few, these teachers have started the decline first
 ab yahi log sarkaar ko gariyaate hai 
 Of course there is a flaw in the government
 vah ausat darje ke logon ko vaais chancelar banaati he or jisaki sarkaar aati he chaahe wo dilli ho yaa patna, kalejon main niyuktiyaan raajnneetik nishtha ke aadhaar par hone lagati he 
 Still, the professors are getting paid
 chaatro ko pataa karnaa chahie chand nishthavan shikshakon ke alaava koun padhaa rahaa he
 At least by making a list of such teachers, you can put it on the walls of the college that Sharma ji takes ten lectures in coaching from eight to ten o'clock in the morning but not even four lectures a week in the college
 buddhijiviyon kaa yahi tabaqa garibon ke jatvaad ke kilaaf lacture detaa he lekin savarnon ke jatvaad ko vikaas kaa sahaara lekar pragatisheel ghoshit karte chalata he
 For this reason, medical studies in Patna have also been annihilated
 pragatisheel or vikaas kii chaah rakhane vaale doctoron kaa network pataa kijiye, kis tareeke se marizon kaa sauda hota he
 But you will see this section talking a lot about development and there is no need to tell what this section is doing to the poor patients
 akaaran nahin he ki bihar chunaav main aspataalon ko lekar koi baat nahin kar rahaa he 
 The youth of Bihar are very good, most of the boys met girls and they did not want to run away from studies
 lekin sarkari shikshak or system ne unki sambhaavna ko kund kar diya he
 There is a severe shortage in political training of students
 ve is sawaal ko apni nishtha vaale dal ke hisaab se dekhte hai jabaki shiksha or swasthya ke maamle main sabhi rajyon or sabhi dalon kaa ricard ausat hi he 
 This is the reason that aspirations are boiling in the towns of the towns of Bihar, their steam is not coming out in these random cities
 jaise tasale ke bheetar chaaval kaa pani to khul rahaa he lekin dhakkan ke kaaran ek baar main baahar nahin aa paa rahaa he
 Steam is blowing away
 aara, sasaram, samastipur, bhagalpur, hajipur ko vistaar kii jarurat he
 If Bihar loses in this case, it will have the effect that its cities will lose huge potential

 Aam Aadmi founder Arvind Kejriwal has problems with the media
 vah kehete hai ki modi kii koihwa nahin he or media ne yah hawa banaai he
 He alleges that the media does not go rooted
 unkakahana he ki media ativaadee he
 He keeps making various statements against the media
 jis mediane unhen rashtriya netaa banaaya uske bare main vah kuch bhi kehete baj nahin aate
 It has become their nature to pull the media when they get a chance
 ab yah samajhnaa mushkil he ki aisa kehane ke peeche unki manshaa kya he, kya vah is tarah ke bayaan dekar media par ek dabaav bananaa chaahate hai taaki unki khud kii kawarej puri hoti rahe yaa phir ve nahin chaahate ki kisi or ko media tawvajo na de? kahana mushkil he
 Kejriwal is not the Kejriwal we saw a year and a half ago
 ab vah raajnneeti ke chatur khilaadi ban chuke hai
 He knows to play with words and also to attack others directly
 vah tamaam chaalen jaanate hai jinase media main bana rahaa ja saktaa he
 The drudgery they beat in their integrity is unmatched
 aisa nahin ki bharat main eemaandaar raajnneetijna yaa mantri nahin he, lekin kejariwal apane ko sarvshereshth bataane main jaraa bhi nahin hichakate
 He forgets that in this country there are also Chief Ministers like Mamata Banerjee, Manohar Parrikar, Nitish Kumar, whose honesty and simplicity have no doubt
 lekin abhi to vah media se khafa dikh rahe hai
 He has a problem about why the media does not show him about everyone
 jabaki sachai yah he ki tivi channelon par vah rahul gandhise bhi zyada samay tak dikhalaae jate rahe hai
 The amount of time the channels showed Rahul Gandhi was shown to Arvind Kejriwal, while Rahul is not only the leader of the national party but his own party is still ruling the country
 lekin kejariwal isse khush nahin he, vah media ke vyavhaar main pakshpaat dekhatehain
 Actually Kejriwal's hunger for publicity motivates him to attack the media
 unhone mediase itnaa kuch paa liya ki yah bhukh or jag gai he
 They need more publicity now
 isipublicity kii talash main unhone apana moto bhi badal liya, vah aae to the bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jhandabuland karne ko lekin unhen laga ki isamen unhen kaaphi publicity mil chuki he to vah sampradayikta kodesh kaa sabase bada dushman maanane lage
 He knew that with this he would come directly in front of Narendra Modi, then he would get a lot of publicity and he also got it
 lekin vah isse khush nahin hai kyonki unhen abhi aurchaahie
 Therefore, he does not hesitate to say that the media is crawling in front of Modi
 chunaav khatm hone vaale hai or rigelt bhi hafte bhar main aa jaaenge
 It will be interesting to see what Kejriwal does to pacify his hunger for publicity
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii suraksha ke intjaam or chaak-chauband karne ke liye kuch nae kadam uthaae gaye hai
 Whenever their convoy is to go by road, two routes are set before it and in addition to their convoy a dummy (fake) convoy also runs along
 pehle aisa sirf apaat sthiti main hi kiya jaataa tha
 The English newspaper Hindustan Times reported this
 soshal media par modi ke aalochak ise shubh lakshan nahin maan rahe
 He is asking why Modi, who described himself as 'the watchman of the treasury of the country' before the elections, is now blowing money on his security
 aakhri vakt par chunaa jaataa he rastapradhanmantri kii yatra ke intjaam se jude ek suraksha adhikari ne akhbaar ko bataaya, 'pradhanmantri narendra modi aatankwaadiyon ke nishane par hai
 So whenever he is about to travel by road, two routes are set before him and his convoy is accompanied by a fake convoy
 donon hi raaston par trephic roak diya jaataa he
 It is decided at the last moment through which way the Prime Minister's convoy will pass
 jo nakli kafila hota he, vah duusare raste par chalaa jaataa he
 The Prime Minister's security is vested with the Special Protection Group (SPG)
 apaat sthiti main hota tha aisasuraksha adhikari ne bataaya ki pehle bhi pradhanmantriyon kii yatra ke dauraan do raste tay kiye jate the, lekin aisa hameshaa nahin hota tha
 Such a step was taken only in emergencies
 adhikari ne bataaya, 'narendra modi ko lashkar-e-taiyaba or jaish-e-mohammad jaise pakistani aatankwaadi sanghathanon se khatra he
 Apart from this, Indian Mujahideen (IM) and SIMI are also targeting him
 jab bhi vah sadak maarg se guzarane vaale hote hai to aatankwaadi sanghathanon kii is par najar hoti he
 Therefore many new steps have been taken for their safety
 'aatanki baithkon main modi kaa zikr?piem kii suraksha se jude sutron ne bataaya ki khufia agenciyon ko pataa chalaa he ki narendra modi ko nishaanaa banane ke liye aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke bich haal main hi kai baithken hui hai
 One of these took place between IM and SIMI in Nepal and the other between Lashkar terrorists in Pakistan
 in baithkon main modi kaa zikr kiya gaya tha

 In the current match in which Zimbabwe beat Australia, an all-rounder named Prosper Utseya took a hat-trick against a team with strong pegs like South Africa
 vah bhi koi puchhlle nahin balki upar ke dhakad ballebaajon ko vidaa karke
 But with a full heart, even then it was estimated that Zimbabwe would lose and it would lose
 nammaatr kii roylty paakar khantee peshewar tiimon ke khilaaf khel rahi, captain chigumbura kii team ne agle hi match main australia ko patakekar ek tarah se dikhaaya he ki hoshiyaar, bahut hua, ham bhi ab khel main aa rahe hai
 And must come, there is enough of 2-4 teams
 nehru apni puri zindagi gulab kot main lagaae raajnneeti karte rahe
 Atal Bihari kept considering Kamal as his everything
 adwani to itani durgati ke baavjood abhi tak camel kii oot main natmastak pade hai
 Even Shahnawaz Hussain is in BJP despite his constant neglect
 lekin raajnneeti main ek phool nahin, alag-alag phulon ke puure guladaste se pyaar karne vaale shaks ko in logon kii style vaali raajnneeti se koi sarokaar nahin
 They choose the flower of their choice and move around with it

 Yes, we are talking about Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Aggarwal coming from Uttar Pradesh
 naresh agarwal ne dekha ki rajyasabha main bane rahane kaa rasta philhal samaajawaadee party kii ore se band ho rahaa he to naaraaz hokar party chhod di or bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye
 But Naresh Aggarwal is not doing this for the first time
 wo uttar pradesh ke rambilas paswan hai
 Have done this many times
 dashak bitne se pehle naresh agarwal party badal lete hai
 Congress, democratic Congress, BSP and SP have now reached BJP
 to kya naresh agarwal kaa bhaajapa main janaa samaajawaadee party ko ek jhatka he
 Initially this may seem to be because Naresh Aggarwal's departure seems to be failing to send the sp's BSP candidate to the Rajya Sabha
 lekin lambii duuri main naresh agarwal sapa nahin, bhaajapa ke liye afat sabit hone vaale hai, yah bhi saaf dikhaai de rahaa he
 While joining the BJP, Naresh Aggarwal expressed his disagreement about sending Jaya Bachchan to the Rajya Sabha, saying that the dancing person was given more preference than him
 is bayaan ko lekar unka virodh bhaajapa main hi shuru ho gaya he
 Her statement has been strongly condemned by the bjp's women leaders
 sushamaa swaraj or smriti irani is fehrist main shaamil hai

 akhilesh bole- 'BJP ke naresh agarwal' kii tippanee abhadra, mahila ayog kare karrwidusri baat yah he ki naresh agarwal ke khilaaf hardoi ke jo bhaajapa netaa or kaaryakarta pichley kai varshon se lagaataar ladate aae hai, wo ab unka jhanda uthaane ko majaboor honge
 For party workers, this will be a situation of undoubtedly frustration
 haalanki bhaajapa netritv ko fori taur par yah chota nuksaan lag saktaa he lekin kader besd party hone ke naate yah kaiyon kaa dil dukhaane ke liye kaaphi he or iske doorgaami nuksaan bhi hai
 Relief to SP: The Samajwadi Party leadership and activist Naresh Agarwal will be happy today
 yah sahi he ki jaya bachchan ko phir se rajyasabha bhejne par party main neeche kaa kaaryakarta niraash zarur hua he or use is faisle kaa koi sidhaa laabh party ko hota nazar nahin aa rahaa he
 Outside, the party has become very bad about this selection
 lekin naresh agarwal ke jane se sapa netaa or akhilesh yadav ke nearesth ramgopal yadav ke alaava kisi or ko dukh hua hoga, aisa katai nahin lagata
 And the party has its logical reasons as well
 pehla to yah ki naresh agarwal party ke liye kisi bhi tarah se votbank vaale netaa nahin the
 Apart from his seat and his influence in Hardoi, Naresh Aggarwal had nothing to give to the SP
 naresh agarwal jis birdari se aate hai, wo paaramparik rup se bhaajapa kii voter rahi he
 The SP has got its advantage
 isliye naresh agarwal kaa bhaajapa main janaa sapa ke liye zero los he
 Naresh Aggarwal's departure is not even going to increase bjp's vote bank
 kyonki yah vot bank to pehle se hi bhaajapa ke paas he
 Then Naresh Agarwal has never been of any one ideology, so he does not even have a permanent support base of his own
 pehle sapa kaa matadaata naresh agarwal ke saath tha, ab bhaajapa kaa hoga
 In such a situation, it is laughable that Naresh Agarwal will be able to give votes to BJP
 doosraa yah ki naresh agarwal ke jane se akhilesh ne ramgopal yadav or unke gut ko ek sandesh bhi diya he ki party main kisi kii manamaani yaa varchasv nahin chalane vaali he
 It is also an invitation for those who were sidelined in the party due to Naresh Aggarwal or Ram Gopal and who had trouble with Naresh Agarwal's stature and position
 party main kam se kam naresh agarwal ke chalate akhilesh se naakhush log ab waapas akhilesh kii ore sakaaratmak hokar aaenge

 jaya bachchan ko lekar bayaan par naresh agarwal ne jataayaa khed, kaha- nahin chahta vivaad hohaan, ek nuksaan yah zarur hua he ki party ke paas ab rajyasabha main apni baat ko majbooti se rakhane vaala koi netaa nahin hoga
 Over the years, Naresh Aggarwal has groomed himself as a strong and influential MP
 wo bolte the to usamen tathy or niyamon ke aadhaar par dibet dikhaai detii thi
 He was seen in some of the outspoken speakers of the opposition in the House
 is tarah sapa ke paas rajyasabha main majboot awaz thi jo ab party ke paksh main bolne ke bajaay uske khilaaf bolne kaa kaam karegi
 But for Akhilesh and SP, the biggest challenge in the Rajya Sabha, more than their outspokenness, is to tackle the BJP on the ground and increase their seats in the upcoming elections
 duusari ore jaya bachchan koi aisa cheharaa nahin hai jiske chalate akhilesh ko party main kisi tarah kii asahajata ho
 Jaya is completely dependent on Akhilesh
 wo vahi bolengi or kahengi jo akhilesh chahenge
 And it is also a good situation for Akhilesh
 naresh agarwal kaa bhaajapa main janaa darasal sapa nahin, khud bhaajapa ke liye zyaada jhatka sabit ho saktaa he
 There are two reasons for this
 pehali to yah ki is faisle se party kaaryakarta hatprabh hai
 The party worker has moved ahead with leaders like Vinay Katiyar
 lekin party vinay katiyaar ko kinare kar naresh agarwal par daanv khel rahi he
 At least the worker will not be able to digest it easily
 party ko baar-baar naresh agarwal ke bhaajapa virdohi bayanon or vivaadit tippaniyon ke chalate munh kii khaani padegi
 In the public forums, it will be gritty because of the earlier statements of Naresh Aggarwal of BJP
 or bhaajapa main gaye naresh agarwal pataa nahin kabatak bhaajapa ke saath rahenge
 Whenever he goes from the party, the heart and morale of the party worker, especially the BJP and Sangh workers of Hardoi, will break once again
 khud naresh agarwal yah bhul rahe hai ki bhaajapa main baaki dalon se aae hue logon kaa kya hashr hua he
 Be it Jitan Ram Manjhi, Ram Achaar Rajbhar, Swami Prasad Maurya, there are so many names whose speed and warmth with which BJP has joined or aligned the party, it has also put them in cold storage
 naresh agarwal or bhaajapa kaa saath donon ke liye antat ghate kaa sauda hi sabit hoga

 The Reserve Bank first gave time till December 30 to deposit the old currency
 is avadhi tak 500 or 1000 rupee ke note jamaa karaae ja sakate the
 But on December 19, passing a new order, the RBI ordered a person to deposit only Rs 5000
 arabiai ne kaha ki bank khataadharakon ko apane paas padi kul puraani karency ko ek baar main jamaa karaani hogi
 But this order did not remain in force for more than 24 hours and the government had to withdraw its decision on Wednesday morning
 puraani karency ko jamaa karne kaa nayaa niyamsomvaar shaam arabiai ne nayaa niyam ghoshit karte vakt kaha tha ki baar-baar bank main puraani karency jamaa karaane par bank adhikari ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dena padegaa
 At the same time, the RBI also prohibited the deposition of old noto in small savings account
 rigerv bank ne is faisle se bainkon ko 30 disambar tak kisi bhi graahak se sirf ek baar 5000 rupee se adhik jamaa karaane ko kaha gaya tha
 However, on depositing more than Rs 5000, banks were also asked to ask the customers the reason for delay in depositing the amount
 yah poochtacha bhi bank ke do karmchaariyon ko ek saath kerani thi
 There was no provision for inquiry on depositing less than Rs 5000
 haalanki is dauraan yadi kisi khate main kai baar rakam jamaa kii jaati he or kul jamaa rakam 5000 rupee se adhik hote hi bank karmchaariyon ko graahakon se deree kaa kaaran bataane ke liye kaha janaa tha
 In order to change the currency and change the note in 42 days of demonetisation, at the beginning of the note ban, a provision was made to exchange an old currency of Rs 4,500 in a bank and get a new currency
 iske liye arabiai ne bainkon ko nirdesh diya ki vah counter se cash badalane vaale graahakon kii ungali main syaahi kaa nishaan lagaaein
 But after it was criticized, ink was refused and the work of changing currency from banks was stopped
 arabiai ne nayaa faisla sunaate hue kaha ki puraani karency ke badale nai karency dene kaa kaam sirf rigerv bank ke offis par kiya jayega
 After the exemption has been implemented for essential services, the government gave 72 hours exemption for the old note to spend on essential services like petrol pumps, milk vendors
 iske baad yah seemaa agle 72 ghanton ke liye or badha di gai or isamen kai anya jaruri sevaaon ko bhi jod diya gaya
 After these 72 hours, the old note was given time till November 24 to spend
 ek baar phir ise petrol pump or toll plaza jaisi sevaaon par kharch karne ke liye 15 disambar tak kaa samay de diya gaya
 With the introduction of ATM withdrawal, RBI made the rule of withdrawing Rs 2000 per card per person from the ATM first
 lekin notebandi prabhavi hone ke ek hafte ke andar arabiai ne is seemaa ko badhaakar 4000 rupee kar diya jisamen ek baar phir sanshodhan karte hue 2,500 rupee kar diya jo philhal lagu he
 After announcing the withdrawal for withdrawal from the bank counter, the RBI first allowed a withdrawal of Rs 10,000 in a day from the bank counter
 vahiin hafte bhar main bank graahak apane khaaton se mahaj 24,000 rupee nikaal sakate the
 But by amending this limit, RBI continued the condition of withdrawal of 24,000 rupees per week, eliminating the per day limit
 vahiin arabiai ne karant acount khate se hafte main mahaj 50,000 rupee vidro karne kii chhot di
 Reserve Bank 2 for marriage

 In the Narendra Modi government, the Congress is not taking the name of ending the troubles
 2014 main haar ke baad 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ko phir karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Now the Congress has to fight for its existence
 sthiti tab vikat ho gai jab loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad rahul gandhi ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 But the party could not even find a new president now that Article 370 made the internal conflict within the party known
 congress ke liye abhi nae adhyaksh kii talash karne kii badi chunauti thi hi, lekin is bich modi sarkaar ne apratyaashit faisla lete hue anuchhed 370 ke tahat jammu-kashmir ko mili special stats kaa darja khatm karne kaa bill sansad main pesh kar diya
 In this central government's googly, the Congress became so entangled that till the end it could not decide which way it would go
 samarthan kare yaa virodh
 The confusion was such that this bill was also passed by both the houses of Parliament and the Congress could not even openly take its stand
 saath hi party ke andar netaaon ke alag-alag paksh saamne aane lage
 In a way, if the elderly leaders of the party were seen against this bill, then the young leaders appeared in favor of it
 bill kaa kade shabdon main virodh -gulam nabigrih mantri amit shah ne somvaar ko rajyasabha main jammu-kashmir punargathan bill pesh kiya to bill ke virodh main congress ke netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 ke tahat hi jammu-kashmir ko bharat ke saath joda gaya tha
 Lakhs of people have sacrificed behind this
 jammu-kashmir ko bharat ke saath rakhane ke liye hajaaron balidaan hue hai
 He said that i strongly oppose this law
 ham bharat ke samvidhan kii raksha ke liye apni jaan kii baaji laga denge lekin ham us act kaa virodh karte hai jo hindustan ke samvidhan ko jalaate hai
 At the same time, another elderly Congress leader P
P
 chidambaram ne bhi bill kaa virodh kiya or amit shah se poocha ki aap kashmir ko centre shasit pradesh kyon bana rahe hai
 Kapil Sibal also said that you have abolished the foundation of the Constitution
 adheer ranjan ke bayaan ne fansaayaloksabhaa main mangalvaar ko jab yahi bill pesh kiya gaya to congress yahaan par saaf stand lene se bachati rahi
 Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary said at the beginning of the debate that you broke Jammu and Kashmir into two parts and made it a union territory
 kashmir ko aap andruni maamle bataate hai, lekin sanyukt raashtra vahaan kii nigaraanee karata he
 On this, Amit Shah interrupted them and said that it is the opinion of Congress that the United Nations can monitor Jammu and Kashmir, this Congress should be clean
 is par sadan main hangaamaa shuru ho gaya
 Amit Shah took this statement of Chaudhary and said that the Congress was told that the issue is in the United Nations
 uski ijaajat ke bina yah bill lekar ham aae hai, congress ko is par apana stand saaf karnaa chahie
 On this, Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary again said that since 1948 the United Nations is under surveillance in Jammu and Kashmir, so how did this become an internal matter
 congress paksh main he yaa vipaksh main, saaf kareh amit shahloksabhaa main congress saansad manish tiwari ne kaha ki bagaiyr samvidhan sabha kii ijaajat ke anuchhed 370 ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Jammu and Kashmir legislative-legislative Council does not mean Parliament
 unhone kaha ki jammu-kashmir kaa alag samvidhan he, jo 1957 ko lagu hua tha, kya ab is rajya ke bantwaare ke baad us samvidhan ko khaarij karne kaa bill bhi sarkaar lekar aegi
 Meanwhile, then Amit Shah pointed out that Congress should tell whether he is in favor or against Article 370
 is par manish tiwari ne kaha ki bagaiyr jammu-kashmir samvidhan sabha kii manjuuri ke anuchhed 370 ko khaarij nahin kar sakate
 What is during the congressional opinion, BJP MP Jitendra Singh said that in the 90s Narasimha Rao's government brought a resolution in which pok and Jammu and Kashmir were considered as an integral part of India
 uskaa hamane samarthan kiya tha
 In the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Sheikh Abdullah also said that Article 370 can be removed
 70 ke dashak tak raay ban chuki thi ki 370 ko janaa chahie kyonki unke apane hit isamen nihit the
 Now Congress should tell what is its commitment on 35A and 370
 congress netaa shashi tharur ne bhi kaha ki jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 There is no disagreement on this
 lekin is bill se loktantric vyavastha, vaishvik parivesh or hamaari vishwasaneeyata ko aghat pahunchaa he, lekin unki ore se bhi yah nahin kaha gaya ki party anuchhed 370 ke maamle main kis ore he
 On the surjammu-kashmir issue of opposition in Congress, the voices of protest are rising against the party stand in Congress
 gandhi parivaar ke behad kareebi kahe jane vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya ne bhi jammu-kashmir se vishesh rajya kaa darja khatm kiye jane kaa samarthan kiya, jabaki party iske khilaaf he
 Earlier on Monday, Rajya Sabha member and chief whip Bhubaneswar Kalita resigned from the membership of the House, opposing the stand of his party Congress on the same issue in Rajya Sabha 
 congress main do-faad kii sthiticongress ke andar itane ahm mudde par do faad kii sthiti par jab gulam nabi aaazaad se poocha gaya to unhone safataur par kaha ki jin logon ko kashmir or congress ke itihaas kii jaankaree nahin he unka isse koi lenaa dena nahin he
 Those people first read the history of Kashmir and Congress
 isse saaf lagata he ki party main andar virodh ke sur punap rahe hai
 At the same time, Jitin Prasad believes that the environment of the country is with the BJP on this issue
 unhone ishaare-ishaare main kaha ki kuch logon ke paksh ko kashmir main samarthan mil rahaa he
 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also tried to clear the party's favor through a tweet, he wrote in his tweet that it is a violation of constitutional procedures
 jammu-kashmir vidhansabha ko bharose main liye bina or vahaan ke netaaon ko kaid karke yah faisla liya gaya he
 But Rahul also could not make it clear that his party is in favor of abolishing the status of Special States through Article 370
 congress ke liye musiibat khatm nahin ho rahi
 The party could not openly come forward on Article 370

 is haadase ke baad lalu ne kaha ki sherawali kii meharbaani se unhen koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa
 Lalu, who was sitting on the stage to campaign in favor of his party's candidate Vinod Srivastav from Motihari Assembly seat, was sipping tea before his address and was being addressed by another speaker, when he was eyeing the stage on his left She went to a ceiling ceiling fan and stopped shaking dangerously
 lalu ukt pankhe kii ore sabha ke aayojakon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kara hi rahe the ki tabhi unke daayin ore unke upar laga pankhaa achaanak unke daahine haath par aa gira
 This spilled his cup of tea on them
 tippaniyan Lalu lashed out at the organizer and electrician for not making proper arrangements while addressing the said meeting held at Lakhaura High School in Motihari Assembly constituency
 unhone kaha ki sherawali (devi durga) kii meharbaani se unhen koi nuksaan nahin pahunchaa
 It is worth mentioning that a part of Lalu's platform which reached to address a public meeting in Arwal two days ago was also broken

 Arvind Kejriwal and some of his colleagues held a meeting the next day after the establishment of the "aam Aadmi Party" to discuss the plans of this new party in Kaushambi's small office in Ghaziabad, adjoining Delhi
 ek sahyogi ke haath main hindi ke ek akhbaar kii kataran thi, jisamen 44 varshiya kejariwal or unki party kii ghor aalochana kii gai thi
 Most of the colleagues present there rejected the article saying that the article belongs to a journalist who has always been critical of Kejriwal and his movement
 kejariwal ne us lekh ko dhyaan se padhaa
 After reading the article, he looked at his colleagues and said, "but what he has written in it is correct
" yah sahi he ki ham aise manch par baithe the, jise baad lagaakar janata se alag kar diya gaya tha
 The public came there to establish the party
 yah bhi sahi he ki vahaan suraksha kaa intjaam tha or ham log vahaan maujuud janata se baatcheet kiye bina hi jaldi se nikal gaye the
 Kejriwal was really worried about this
 apni sthapana ke din se hi unki party duusari partiyon kii tarah ban gai thi
 Like all other leaders, he distanced himself from the common man
 taqatvar se loha lene kaa bhayitihaas ke ek anokhe mode par ek anokhe andolan ke bikhar jane kaa bhay hi vah cheez he, jo nirbhik kejariwal ko daraati he
 Kejriwal, who competed with Robert Vadra to Nitin Gadkari and Mukesh Ambani within a month, says, "I am not afraid of anyone
" lekin darataa hum ki kahin apane hi andolan main koi galati na kar duun
 "they want to do everything according to plan
" aam aadmi se netaa bane kejariwal kaushambi main apane daftar se kuch hi kadam kii duuri par sthit apane ghar par india today se baatcheet karne ke liye raji ho gaye
 It is strange that Kejriwal, who raised the flag against the government, lives in a government house found by his wife Sunita, which is designed for officers of the Indian Revenue Service
 sunita do saal kii chuttee par jane se pehle abhi haal tak syrius frods investigeshan offis main niyukt thim
 Kejriwal says that some of his friends from IIT Kharagpur, who now live in the US, raise Rs 25,000 each month by raising money among themselves
 nijee kharch ke liye bhej dete hai
 He lives like a middle class ordinary man
 unke drawingroom main bent kii kursiyaan rakhi hai or tubalite jal rahi he
 His family is at home on Sunday, but Kejriwal has just returned in the evening after working all day in the office
 mouj-masti ke apane vichaar ke bare main ve muskaraate hue kehete hai, ‘‘ham do hafte main ek din film dekhne jate hai
 "what is the inspiration that forced him to become an agitator by giving him a good job and happy life?" kejariwal kehete hai, ‘‘main har roj anyaay ke khilaaf ladgaye ke liye prerit hota hum
 Everyone has a strong feeling against injustice
 haa yah baat sahi he ki kuch logon main yah bhaavana dusron kii apeksha zyada gahari hoti he
 a week later, thousands of people flocked to the streets in Delhi and across the country to protest against the shameful incident of gang rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in a moving bus in Delhi
 jaahir he, aam aadmi bhi is anyaay ke khilaaf udwelit he
 Kejriwal truly has the right to justify himself
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘pehle log dare hue the ki sarkaar unke khilaaf kuch bhi kar sakati he
 My job was to get this fear out of their minds
 ’’ virodh pradarshnon ne sabit kar diya ki aam aadmi ke dil se satta kaa dar nikal chukaa he
 They came out on the streets to raise their voice against powerful people
 ve vyavastha se nyaay maangane ke liye sadakon par jamaa hue
 This is the real legacy of Kejriwal
 kolkata kii sadakon par bhikhaariyon ke liye kaamlekin kis baat ne kejarival ko samaaj seva ke prati prerit kiya? is sawaal par kejariwal niruttar ho jate hai
 He says, "many people ask me this question
 eemaandaaree se kahuun to main khud bhi iskaa uttar nahin jaanata
 "all he remembers is that he made his first step in the world of social service with Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Churiti in Kolkata
" ve bataate hai, ‘‘yah 1990 ke dashak ke shuru kii baat he
 After graduating from IIT, i had worked for two-three years at Tisco in Jamshedpur
 ’’ us samay unka makasad iees adhikari bananaa tha
 He had given the Mains exam and was waiting for the interview letter to appear
 isi bich unke paas kuch alag kaam karne kaa samay bachaa tha
 He says, "that's when i contacted Mother Teresa
 unhone mujhase kolkata kii sadakon par bhikhaariyon ke liye kaam karne ke liye kaha
 Kejriwal was shaken by the plight of the city's beggars
 ‘‘main unke ghaav saaf karata, jo lagbhag sad chuke hote the
 i bathe them
 ’’madar terresa ke saath do maheene kaam karne ke baad unhone ramakrishna mishan ke liye bhi kaam kiya
 The mission was working on plans for rural development in West Bengal
 vahaan kaam karte hue kejariwal ke man main iees adhikari banane kii ichha or bhi balwati ho gai
 He felt that by becoming an officer he could actually bring some changes
 ve iees adhikari to nahin ban sake lekin ve bhartiya rajasav seva (iares) main salect ho gaye
 He was reluctant to join this job but accepted it at the behest of friends
 unhone dilli main inakam tex ke vibhinn vibhaagon main kaam karte hue saat saal bitaye
 He was an officer who fought against powerful people even while in government service
 1998 main unhone apane upar ke adhikari ke saath ek bahurashtriya company ke daftar par chapa maaraa, jahaan unhen tex chori karne ke dheron saboot haath lage
 The company was heavily fined
 kejariwal bataate hai, ‘‘unhone hamaare is faisle ke khilaaf apil tak nahin kii
 The CEO of that company was a foreigner
 usne kaha, ‘‘ham tumhaari sarkaar chalaate hai
 We can transfer any of you
 ’’ is ghatana ke ek hafte ke bheetar sachmuch unke bos kaa tabadalaa ho gaya
 Kejriwal quit IRS after three years as he wanted to focus on his NGO 'parivartan'
 is enjio ne soochna ke adhikaar kanoon (artiai) kii vakaalat ke liye kaam kiya
 Ten years later, he became the face of the fight against corruption
 is ladaai kii shuruyaat unhone anna hajaare ke saath kii thi
 a more difficult election than exposing the face, he started with Hazare's favorite method of protest - the hunger strike
 lekin unhen jaldi hi ehsaas ho gaya ki yah zyada kargar tarika nahin he
 He adopted a strategy to expose the faces
 unhone robert wadra ke saudon, nitin gadakari ke kaarobaar or kendriya mantri salmaan khurshid ke trust kii kathith dhaandhliyon ko benakaab karke surkhiyaan batorin
 In addition, he also targeted merchants holding accounts with Swiss bank
 chauthe khulaase ke baad unki yah ranneeti kamjor padane lagi
 The media stopped paying attention to their disclosures because the evidence being presented in their disclosures was weak
 lekin tab tak ve satta pratishthan ko jad se hilaa chuke the
 Kejriwal insists that his motive was never to make headlines
 rajnatik vishleshak or kejariwal ke kareebi yogendra yadav ke mutabik, ye khulaase do kaarnon se mahatvapurn the
 These revelations drove the movement and Kejriwal out of Anna's shadow
 doosraa, in khulaason ne sabit kar diya ki sattadhari varg, chaahe vah kisi bhi party kaa ho or jinamein vyapaaree bhi shaamil hai, aapas main mila hua he or bhrasht he
 This set the stage for Kejriwal's next step, that is, politics
 ve kehete hai ki yah sahi faisla tha, haalanki team anna ke kuch sadasyon jaise kiran bedi or en
 Santosh Hegde had opposed the move
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘ek seemaa ke baad sarkaar aapaki baat nahin sunegi
 For example, they will not do anything on the issue of Jan Lokpal
 isiilie hamane vyavastha main parivartan ke liye raajnneeti main utarane kaa faisla kiya
 Kejriwal founded the Aam Aadmi Party in the last week of November
 unki party ke liye kai naam sujhaaye gaye
 One of them was the Swaraj Party
 aam aadmi party se pehle bana sanghathan india against karpshan kii pariklpana main mukhya uddeshy tay kiya gaya tha, 1947 ke baad duusari kranti yaa sahi arthon main swaraj
 But finally, due to Vadra's sarcasm "mango People", he decided to name his party as Aam Aadmi Party (AAP or AAP)
 is nai party kaa mukhya siddhant he, ‘‘puri aazaadee’’ jo party ke sadasyon kii tapiyon par ankit he
 Kejriwal says, "democracy does not mean an election to be held in five years
 iskaa matlab he logon ke haath main satta honi chahie
 "political decentralization is the main agenda of the AAP, so that most decisions should be made at the level of panchayat or urban government bodies
" baaki kaa agenda abhi spasht nahin he, khaskar aarthik niti, videshi niti or suraksha ke maamle main
 Kejriwal says, "we will welcome suggestions from every field to set our agenda
" ’’ eepi 13 janvari se teen din kii kaaryshaala lagane kii yojana bana rahi he
 On the issue of economic policy, the AAP is looking to follow a left-leaning policy
 yadav kehete hai, ‘‘garib desh main hamen vampanth kii ore hi rahanaa hoga
 "but the party says that it is not dogmatic about the government's control over economic activity
" kejariwal kehete hai, ‘‘darasal, ham rosemara kii jindagi main sarkaar kii dakhlandaji ke paksh main nahin hai
 The party's first target is Delhi's assembly elections, which are due in November 2013
 iske baad may, 2014 main hone vaala loksabhaa kaa chunaav
 Kejriwal is well aware of the challenges of forming a party organization in a hurry
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘hamen vah kaam ek hi saal main karnaa he, jo congress ne 100 saal or bijepi ne 30 saal main kiya
 "AAP will have no central high command
 log america kii tarah primary chunaavon ke jariye apane ummidavaaron kaa chayan karenge
 In the eyes of supporters, Kejriwal's face is necessary for the success of his leader as the most different and capable party
 ve duusare netaaon se ekadam alag hai, paramparaagat tareeke se dekhen to ve kahin se bhi karishmai nahin dikhte
 His supporters believe that he is the most different kind of leader
 yadav kehete hai, ‘‘unka karishma unke saadhaaran hone main hi he
 According to Prashant Bhushan, a prominent member of the AAP, Kejriwal's dedication to the objectives and his energy makes him different from others
 bhushan kehete hai, ‘‘unke jehan main chijen ekadam spasht hoti hai
 Also they know to decide immediately
 ’’unke aalochakon, jinamein team anna ke kuch sadsy bhi shaamil hai, kaa kahana he ki kejariwal ghamandi hai, khud ko sadaachari samajhate hai, mahatvakankshi hai or satta ke bhukhe hai
 Kejriwal does not comment on this
 ve kehete hai ki iskaa faisla to log hi karenge
 What will be the political future of Kejriwal, it will be decided by the elections of 2013 and 2014
 lekin is purv naukarshah or activist ne bhartiya raajnneeti main apni dastak de di he

 He said that Nitish Kumar should explain that if the appointment of the daughter of the Health Minister was not illegal then why did he resign from the post of Librarian at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna?

 The party has fielded Vikramaditya Singh, son of outgoing Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh from Shimla Rural Assembly seat
 vahiin mandi seat se nivartmaan mantri kaul singh thakur kii beti champa singh ko party ne tikat diya he
 It is worth mentioning that Shimla Rural seat is currently being represented by Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh but this time he had demanded a ticket from this seat for his son and Himachal Pradesh Youth Congress President Vikramaditya Singh and announced publicly that His son will contest from his seat
 mukhyamantri solan jile ke arki vidhansabha se chunaav ladenge or party ne vahaan se unkiummidavaari kii ghoshnaaki he
 The party has given ticket to Champa Singh, daughter of state minister Kaul Singh Thakur, from Mandi assembly seat

 After the Gujarat assembly election results, different figures are coming out from the assessment of data
 bijepi ko 22 saal baad ek baar phir satta ke shikhar tak pahunchane kaa mauka mila he
 Despite the defeat, the Congress seems satisfied with its performance
 isaki vajah uske vot pratishat se lekar siton kii sankhya main ijapha hona tak he
 The Congress changed its strategy in Gujarat, and in addition to the party, outside leaders like Patidar leader Hardik Patel, Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani and OBC leader Alpesh Thakur gave more importance
 nattejey bataate hai ki ye ranneeti kaaphi had tak kargar bhi rahi lekin ye bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki congress apni is kavayad main apane un puraane sahyogiyon ko bhul gai jinke saath usne sampradayik shaktiyon se ladane ke naam par sanyukt rup se sarkaar chalaai he
 Statistics show that the electoral outcome could have been quite different had the Congress taken these parties along
 gujarat kaa chunaav mukhya rup se congress or bijepi ke bich ladaa jaataa he
 Apart from these two national parties, there are some regional parties who try their luck
 inamen mayawati kii bahujan samaaj party or sharad pavaar kii rashtravaadi congress party pramukh hai
 Although, apart from these two parties, the influence of all other regional parties is very less in electoral politics, but the BSP and NCP are in a position that their combined vote percentage can play the role of savior
 maujuuda chunaav ke maddenjar in donon dalon kii bhoomika kaa bhi aankalan mahatvapurn najar aa rahaa he
 In fact, after a long time, the Congress gave a tough challenge to the BJP in the Gujarat elections
 donon dalon ke bich kaante kii takkar dekhne ko mili or kai siton par jeet-haar kaa antar bahut zyada nahin rahaa
 In the 182-member Gujarat Assembly, the BJP had to settle for less than 100 seats for the first time in the last 6 elections and won only 99 seats
 jabaki congress gathbandhan ko 80 siten milin
 In the remaining three seats, NCP and Independent candidates waved two seats in one
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav menmahagathbandhan ke jis formule par vipakshi dalonmen koshishen chal rahi hai, gujarat chunaav main uskaa demo bijepi ke khilaaf lamaband hone kaa ek bada aadhaar sabit ho saktaa tha
 Actually, BJP 49 in Gujarat
 1 fisad vot ke saath 99 siten mili hai
 a total of 1 crore 47 lakh 24 thousand 427 voters chose BJP
 vahiin, 1 karod 24 lakh 38 hajaar 937 matadaataaon ne congress ke nishaan par batan dabaaya or uskaa vot fisad 41
 It was 4 percent
 bijepi ko congress se 22 lakh 85 hajaar 490 vot zyada or iskaa antar kareeb 8 fisad rahaa
 In many seats, the margin of defeat and victory between BJP and Congress has been less than 3 thousand votes
 aisi siton par agar bispi yaa ensipi ke vot congress ke paksh main chale jate to aankade badal sakate the
 For example, in Dholka seat of Ahmedabad, BJP won by 327 votes, while NCP got 1198 and BSP got 1104 votes in this seat
 agar ye donon dal congress ke saath chunaav ladate or itnaa hi vot congress ke paale main jane kii sthiti ban paati to congress is seat par vijay praapt kar leti
 BSP-NCP got BSP 0 in Gujarat elections
 7 fisad vot hasil hue or us par 207007 matadaataaon ne bharosa jataayaa
 While NCP got one lakh 84 thousand 815 votes and its vote percentage was 0
 6 rahaa
 Not only this, a large number of people voted for NOTA in the election
 nota par 5 lakh 51 hajaar 615 vot pade jo ki vot fisad kaa 1
 It was 8 percent
 ateet main bispi or ensipi donon hi dal congress ke saath sarkaar main rah chuke hai
 There is also a lot of efforts of opposition solidarity to defeat the Modi wave in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, in such a way that the assembly elections of Gujarat were also fought against the BJP as UPA alliances, then the result of Rahul Gandhi's electoral examination was celebrated for him

 unhone bhartiya seemaa kii ore kaaman chaowkee (uri sector main) par chote hathiyaaron or arpiji se goliyaan chalaayin
 He said that the motive of the firing seems to be to disturb peace on the Line of Control
 chouhan ne kaha, 'vastav main yah (golibari kaa sthal) pakistani chaowkee ke nikat kaa ilaaka he
 So it can be deduced that the elements are against the interests of the people, rather i would say that peace is maintained along the Line of Control or against trade across the Line of Control (this firing act is their job)

 The huge Shiva temple of Vaidyanath Dham located in Deoghar district of Jharkhand is different from all the 12 Jyotirpeeths
 yahi kaaran he ki sawan main yahaan ke jyotirling par jalabhishek karne waalon kii sankhya din pratidin bad rahi he
 The biggest feature of this temple is that it has 'panchshul' on its top, not Trishul, which is considered as a protective shield
 dharmacharyon kaa kahana he ki shivpurana main jyotirling kii puja kaa mahatv bataaya gaya he
 It is said that if someone worships Shiva Jyotirlinga continuously for six months, then he does not have to suffer the rebirth
 vaidyanath mandir ke sheersh par lage panchashul ke vishay main dharm ke jaankaron kaa alag-alag mat he
 There is a belief that in the Treta Yuga, Ravana's Panchshula was also installed as a security shield at the gate of Lankapuri
 mandir ke tirth purohit durlabh mishra bataate hai ki dharmik granthon main kaha gaya he ki ravan ko panchashul yani suraksha kavach ko bhednaa aata tha, jabaki yah bhagwaan ram ke vash main bhi nahin tha
 Rama and his army were able to enter Lanka when Vibhishan suggested the tip
 unhone kaha ki suraksha kavach ke kaaran hi is mandir par aaj tak kisi bhi prakritik aapadaa kaa asar nahin hua he
 The pundits say that the second function of Panchshul is to destroy the five disorders present in the human body - work, anger, greed, fascination and jealousy
 magar pandit radha mohan mishra ne is panchashul ko panchtatwon-kshiti, jal, paavak, gagan tathaa samir se bane maanav sharir kaa dyotak bataaya
 According to the pandas of the temple, the Panchshulas on all the 22 temples here, including the Panchshul above the Golden Kalash in the main temple, are taken down once a year on the day of Shivratri
 sabhi ko ek nishchit sthaan par rakhkar vishesh puja kar phir se vahiin sthapit kar diya jaataa he
 During this time, the alliance of Shiva and Parvati temples is also removed
 laal kapade ke do tukdon main di gai ganth khol di jaati he or mahashivaratri ke din phir se nayaa gathbandhan kiya jaataa he
 Thousands of devotees gather here to get two pieces of old red cloth with knots
 gyaat ho ki panchashul ko mandir se neeche laane or phir upar sthapit karne kaa adhikaar ek hi parivaar ko praapt he
 Though there are 22 temples of various deities in the courtyard of the Vaidyanath Dham temple, but when and who built the grand and huge temple of Shiva in the middle, it is considered a matter of research
 madhya praangan main 72 feet oonche shiv mandir ke alaava anya 22 mandir sthapit hai
 In this courtyard, there is an hour, a moon and a huge lion door for entry
 dilli main kuch hi dino pehlepedonki kataai ko lekar logon ne virodh pradarshan kiya tha
 Now once again people are angry about the pruning of trees
 darasal,dilli sarkaarake antargat aane vaala maharani baag sthit ring road sivej pumping stesan main pichley teen dinon se pedo kii chantai kaa kaam ho rahaa tha
 But the trees have been cut in half in the name of pruning
 aise main monsoon sizan ke baad hone vaali pruning yani chantai par kai sawaal khadey ho rahe hai
 Local people said that due to the trees, people get a lot of oxygen, but for the last three days, there is difficulty in breathing
 jab ajtak kii team sivej pump ke andar daakhil hui tab hamane paaya ki aas-paas ke kuch pedo kii chantai to hui thi lekin ashok ke pedo ko tane se aadha hi kar diya gaya
 Peepal and neem trees have also been pruned
 sanlite colony thane main shikayatpedo kii kataai ko lekar ek shikaayat sanlite colony thane main bhi kar di gai he
 Explain that in South Delhi's Netaji Nagar and Naoroji Nagar areas, the local people, who were troubled by the felling of trees, protested and then the High Court had stopped the felling of trees
 tab dilli sarkaar ne centre sarkaar ke dakshini dilli main taiyaar ho rahe flaton ke nirmaan main pedo ke kaate jane par aade haathon liya tha
 a person associated with the Delhi government, on the condition of anonymity, said that about 25 to 30 trees were cut in the name of pruning

 After this JDU press conference, RJD state president Ramchandra Purave said that you are aware that the work of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as Deputy Chief Minister, Minister of Roads and Building Construction has been extremely satisfactory and commendable and there was no accusation anywhere during this period
 Therefore, there is no question of his resignation

 hamaara jo stand he vah hamane aapke saamne rakhaa he
 Significantly, the CBI raided 12 locations in Patna, Delhi, Ranchi and Gurugram linked to RJD President Lalu Prasad and his family members
 is maamle main sibiai ne lalu prasad, unki patni rabari devi tathaa unke putr or upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav sahit kai anya ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kii he

 modi ko lekar kalbe sadik ke bayaan ko unka apana nijee bayaan bataate hue babari masjid ection cameti ke sanyojak jafarayab jilani ne kaha he ki modi ke ateet ko bhulane kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Even if Modi says something about this, he cannot be trusted
 modi pehle gujarat ke dangon ke daag dhokar dikhaaen tabhi unke bare main kuch sochaa ja saktaa
 On the other hand, Sunni religion guru Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahali has also described it as a personal view of Shia religious leader, saying that the Muslims of the country can never forgive Modi for the slaughter of Muslims in Gujarat
 saath hi unka ye bhi kahana tha ki sabase pehle gujarat dangon ke liye jimmedaar logon ke khilaaf karwai ho or peediton ko insaaf milanaa chaiye
 Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahli of Idgah, Pesh Imam of Lucknow said, 'whatever has happened in 2002 in Gujarat
 hajaaron musalamaanon kaa katleam hua he
 If a man says that those responsible for the 2002 riots should be forgiven or forgotten
 uske ateet ko nazarandaaj kar diya jaye to ye posible nahin he, kisi bhi surat main nahin
 First of all, it is necessary that whatever is happening in Gujarat, cleanliness should be presented, those who are criminals should be punished and those who are guilty are punished
 usee ke baad in silsile main koi baat sochi ja sakati he
 If someone comments on this, then this can be considered his personal view
 lekin musalamaanon kaa on da hole najariya nahin mana ja saktaa he
 Mahli further said, 'there is a way or a way to forgive Modi or forget him
 modi ke saath sabase bada masalaa communalism kaa he
 The 2002 Gujarat riots
 agar aap unka trek record dekhen
 Has been Chief Minister 3 times, not given ticket to any Muslim even once
 kisi musalmaan ko is laayak nahin samajha ki use ministry main shaamil kiya jaae
 Apart from this, the issue of Section 370 in Kashmir is a matter of Uniform Civil Code
 babari masjid kaa masalaa he jabatak in masalon par udhar se safai nahin aati he tabatak aap is bare kuch soch hi nahin sakate
 On the other hand, Zafarib Jilani, the governor of the All India Babri Masjid Action Committee in Lucknow, said, "this may be his own personal view, but our opinion is whether the promise made by the Sangh Parivar people does not even matter
 inhone 1992 main jab babari masjid ke bare main jab supreme court main cese chal rahaa tha
 So the Chief Minister himself and Naib Sadar of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad had written an affidavit in the Supreme Court that the building would not be harmed
 jabaki wo log tay kar chuke the ki isko giraanaa he or unhone gira di
 Babri Masjid was martyred
 aise logon kaa jabaani vaayade kii kya ahmiyat he
 Jilani further said that even though he is not making any such promise right now, why should we offer this to him without any reason
 ye to aajamaae hue log hai
 About 10-11 years, not only in Gujarat but in the country's secular voice and media, it is being said that now Gujarat should be neutral about the riots
 supreme court ke diarection ke baad unako mukadmaa transfar karnaa padaa
 If you have not done anything till date, then how can you be confident about saying a couple of jumla about it? yah puche jane par ki aakhir un par aap bharosa kaise kar sakate hai, koi surat he to is par jilani ne kaha, 'dekhiye bharosa to ye hota he ki maan lijie kisi se koi galati ho jaae
 So he should remove that mistake, along with that he can see that he is removing that mistake
 gujarat main jo ab tak hua he or jo unhone ab tak nahin kiya
 Suppose they are being accused, their DGP is accusing them that we were instructed by the state
 uske bare main bataaen jinke bare main iljaam lag rahaa he unke bare main inquayri karen
 They should get justice in the cases which they have ended or in the cases where they are not allowed to be justice
 jitani bhi imaaraten vahaan giri thim
 Mosques and other buildings for which the High Court directed that you get them repaired, get those people who have not yet been rehabilitated, get them rehabilitated
 ye sab insaaf jab dilaayenge tab aadmi kuch sochega

 jammu kashmir ke halaat or vahaan hinsa kii khabaron par pratikriya dete hue unhone kaha ki choti-moti ghatnaayen pehali baar nahin ho raheen
 He said that there is no tense situation in Jammu and Kashmir where curfew used to remain for months and even before that the leaders were in jail for years

 We have taken decisions like imposing a ban as a precautionary step keeping in mind Pakistan's intentions to plot and block any law and order situation in Jammu and Kashmir

 He said, "pakistan is plotting to prove to the world that what the Indian government has done is wrong
" kyonki aaj puri duniya bharat ke paksh main he

" aap jammu kashmir ja sakate hai
 Keep calm some days abhi pakistan kii samasya ko dekhte hai
 After that Rahul Gandhi can hold any number of meetings
 manaa koun kar rahaa he? dhiraj to rakhie
 "reddy said," Why are you in a hurry? On one hand, Pakistan is trying its best to tell the world that there is no peace
 ab vipakshi party bhi pakistan ke saath janaa chaahati hai
 this is wrong
 '' jammu kashmir main netaaon ko reeha kiye jane ke sawaal par mantri ne kaha ki is vishay par sambandhit adhikari nirnay karenge

 gujarat ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki jab kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hote hai, to dilli main sarkaar khamoshi se so rahi hoti he
 Talking about the reasons for farmers' suicides, Modi said that due to many different reasons, farmers have to take loans and they get caught in its net
 unhone sankalp liya ki loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad agar unki sarkaar satta main aati he to kisaanon ko baari byaaj par karj lene ke liye sahukaaron ke paas nahin janaa hoga

 kapaas kisaanon ke muddon ko uthaate hue unhone kisaanon ko hone vaale ghate ke liye centre par aarope lagaaya ki ve kapaas ke niryaat ko pratibandhit karke unhen nuksaan main daal rahi he jabaki duusari ore maance ke niryaat ko badhaava diya ja rahaa he
 He questioned why cotton exports were banned
 sarkaar par taana kasate hue modi ne kaha ki har sankat ke baad package kii ghoshnaa karnaa ek fishan ban gaya he or salaah di he ki aise package baantne waalon ko nipataane kaa samay aa gaya he jo package aap tak nahin pahunchataa
 Elections! Everything is bitter
 yah kahana tha srinagar main pidiyon se based ek nivasee kaa
 
 
 Life is slowly returning to the tracks after flooding for people

 kya aayega koi aglaa tendulkar, salaam sachin main hui is par baat, panel main the purv cricketer dilip vengsarakar, kiran more or bishan singh bedi
 They were followed by Vikrant Gupta
 aaie jaane kya bole vah-dilip:mujhe nahin lagata ki aglaa sachin mumkin he
 Who will start playing in 15-16 years and maintain fitness and form for so long
 mujhe yaad he ki assi ke dashak main schuli cricket main sachin kii dhooma machane lagi thi
 Then my friend Vasu told that Dilip must look at this boy
 inter skool kaa final tha anjuman islam ke khilaaf
 Sachin was playing this opportunity
 vasu ke kehane par main gaya
 Sachin scored 300 runs
 main uske bare main poocha
 It turned out that right now it will also throw at least forty overs
 aisa hi tha aachrekar sar kaa ye ladkaa
 Will be batting use bowling bhi chahie
 Then i called him on the nets
 chetan sharma, maninder vagairah ko bowling ke liye kaha
 It was a bit complicated
 magar usne achche se khelaa
 Then we took him to tea in the evening
 baat ho rahi thi baaki senior logon se, ki ise mumbai kii ranjai team main liya janaa chahie ki nahin
 Everyone was saying that it is too small
 magar phir ise liya
 Then it played brilliantly at every level from Ranji
 tabhi vasu ne raaj singh duungarpur sahab se kaha
 It was before the West Indies tour, Vasu said, Raj bhai, take this in the AAP team
 raaj bole pagal ho gaye ho kya
 What are there fast bowlers? ye march 1989 kii baat he
 He made his debut six months later
 bishan singh bedi:hamen kyon chahie doosraa sachin tendulkar
 This is greed
 wo bharat ratna he hamaara
 We are proud of that
 aglaa sachin kab aayega, kaise aayega
 There is no need to be so distraught over it
 inshollah jarur aayega
 Geniuses are not born in an instant
 shrey unki maa ko jaataa he
 Kiran More: Sachin Tendulkar spent 24 years in the dressing room
 main kaaphi players dekh rahaa hum, jo unhen copy kar rahe hai, viraat kohli hai, rohit sharma hai
 Go to any academy anywhere you go
 har koi vahi karnaa chahta he
 Those who learn a little bit
 khaastaur par indian team main
 Rohit, Virat and Yuvraj as well
 inhone kareeb se dekhakar sachin ko, bahut siikhaa he
 New kids come, keep watching, what Sachin is doing
 aap viraat or rohit ko dekho
 Virat can break Sachin's record of centuries
 quality he usamen
 He has learned a lot from Sachin
 sachin jab pakistan gaya tha 15 saal kaa tha, hamaare saath team main jab aayaa
 It used to come at one o'clock and i would play for hours
 bolta, kiran meraa balla thik se nahin aa rahaa
 Sachin looked to Gavaskar for inspiration
 unka chalanaa
 Wearing pads like Sunny brother
 wo puri peedi aisi hi thi
 We also used to copy Sunny Bhai
 sachin unka big fain tha, aaj bhi he
 a phase came and people said Andulkar, what used to happen in that phase Dileep: Everyone knew that there was a bad phase
 logon ko lagata tha ki vah jaae or centuri banaae har baar
 He was also scoring
 magar utane nahin, jitne kii aadat thi
 Just a big inning was needed
 wo hua or sab chup ho gaye
 i was talking to him, then he used to say on everything that i discus with Ajit Dada (sachin's elder brother)
 bahut maanata he apane bhai ko
 Sanjay Manjrekar told me
 har subah ajit phone karata tha
 Sanjay told that he used to keep talking and Sachin just kept saying yes
 phir so jaataa tha
 Ajit spent his whole life for Sachin
 aaj bhi sachin batting karne jaataa he, to ajit tence ho jaataa he
 Ajit has a big role in every decision of Sachin
 bishan singh bedi:sachin ne jo kiya apane pyaar ke liye kiya, cricket ke liye
 Let me tell you an anecdote
 us tour par ye maharathi bhi the
 The wicket was very bad for practice
 ye senior player kaamchori ke bahut shaukeen the
 i said if i do not practice, i will train
 opshanal seshan rakhaa, jisko batting kerani he karo
 a boy came
 bolaa, main karuunga sar
 We said, let's fear spin, we will spin
 usne kya kiya ki centre main wicket kharaab thi
 So there was clean ground on the side of the net
 usne stump gaade or 45 minute kheltaa rahaa
 He was Sachin Tendulkar
 bahut pyaara baccha tha
 Maryada Purushottam type
 ye vakya main kabhi nahin bhuluungaa
 Kiran More: Sachin came with brother on tour to Pakistan, also had books
 magar newjiland vah akele aae the
 He partnered with me in Napier
 85 ran par vah out ho gaye, to bahut roe
 But this experience came in handy
 bedi:viraat or rohit main sachin ke saath kaa asar dikh rahaa tha
 Sachin's work ethics is not going to change even after leaving cricket
 wo ek junun lekar paidaa hua he
 Morey: Imran Khan used to speak out Giddu for Sachin
 vah baar baar bolta, isko out karo, baaki main kaam kar duungaa
 Before that we used to lose
 magar sachin ke aane ke baad sab badal gaya
 See you 92 World Cup
 usne pakistan ke khilaaf jo fifty maari
 We started winning after Sachin in Sharjah as well
 usne abdul kaadir kii jo haalat kharaab kii
 We went shopping
 peshawari juuti kharidne, main shastri, lamba gaye the
 Then the sound started coming from the stadium
 abdool kaadir ko har jagah maaraa ja rahaa tha
 There was slogging, but clean
 kaaphi log aate hai, maarthe hai, kuch lag jate hai
 But Sachin's shots were cricketing
 samaj aa gaya ki ye kuch alag he
 Since then, Imran Khan was very scared of Sachin
 wo har cheez main involve rahata tha
 Bowling, Fielding
 bedi:lakshmana, dravid, kumble ke aane se sachin ko madad mili or khulkar khilne main
 Pardeepal, the captaincy issue: He did not find the team good
 usne kuch player maange, nahin die gaye
 He was not happy about it
 selector uske khilaaf adane lage the
 He felt that if Sachin was asking, he should not give, he was wrong
 bedi:sachin kaa temparament alag tha
 He was shy
 shaayad isiilie use captency main itnaa majaa nahin aayaa
 i think his middle class background was good for batting, but it also brought some weakness in terms of captaincy
 ham padhate rahete hai ki usne is bowler us batsman kii help kii
 But it was in the form of decoration
 athurity ke nahin
 You see, Sir Sobers, the world's greatest all-rounder, did not prove to be a good captain
 more:sachin kaa khel kaa level bahut ooncha tha
 He expected the same from the rest of the players
 use lagata tha ki main kar saktaa hum, to ve kyon nahin kar sakate
 He was inadvertently pushing them continuously
 usase ye haalat hui
 When i became a selector, i talked to him
 itane interesting input milte the mujhe, jo kaaphi help karte rahe
 Bedi: This is Sachin Singh Tendulkar
 sab team main use sachin paaji bolte hai
 Have you heard this for a Maharashtrian? More: That's why Imran used to speak
 giddu ko out karo
 i have seen Sachin Paji's influence in the dressing room
 dhoni ne bataaya mujhe
 Kiran did not lose sight of my Sachin for even a second
 dhoni ne sachin or dravid se bahut kuch siikhaa
 Bedi: Sachin is the prophet of God
 vah khuda kaa paigaam laayaa he ki kaise khelnaa chahie
 You may not have seen him doing any act of sorrow
 shart utaar lee, naachne lag gaye wicket lekar, wicket lekar hairaan pareshaan ho gaye
 Hey how did that happen ye sab usne nahin kiya kabhi
 Sachin Tendulkar has been wearing a helmet made at Kiran Mori's Vadodara factory for 24 years
 kiran more:haa cricket se judaa kuch bananaa tha
 He was safe in our helmet
 hamen lagata tha ki kuch ho gaya
 So we have to close the factory
 bhartiya janata party ne is saal hone vaale gujarat chunaav ke liye taiyaariyaan shuru kar di hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's two-day visit to Surat is also being linked to the beginning of Gujarat election preparations
 piem modi or rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ke liye gujarat ahm he, kyonki dilli jane se pehle donon ne lambey samay tak yahaan raajnneeti kii he
 Under Modi's leadership, BJP has won elections here in 2002, 2007 and 2012, but it has become a challenge for the state party since he became Prime Minister in 2014
 amit shah ne rakhaa 150 siton ko lakshyamodi ke dilli jane ke baad se rajya main kai chijen bijepi ke paksh main nahin hui hai
 Here the biggest agitation by the Patidar Samaj demanded reservation
 aise main ek baar phir rajya kii satta main vaapasi ke liye bijepi ko patel-patidaar logon kii naaraazgi ko dur karnaa hoga
 After forming the government in 4 states recently, Amit Shah's next target is to get 150 seats in Gujarat, but due to the displeasure of Patel community, it will not be easy for BJP to get so many seats
 BJP kaa main vot bank he patel samudaayagujrat kii kul aabaadi 6 karod 27 lakh he
 patel-patidar population constitutes 20 percent of it
 patel samudaay kii maang rahi he ki unhen obisi states diya jaae, taaki collejon or naukariyon main unhen rigerveshan mil sake
 The state currently has an OBC reservation of 27 percent
 obisi main 146 community pehle se listed he
 The patel-patidar community wants to include itself in the OBC list as the 146th community
 gujarat main is samudaay ke vot ko bijepi kaa pramukh vot bank mana jaataa he
 40 BJP mlas and 6 mps belong to this community
 lekin patel andolan se upji naaraazgi ko is baar bijepi ke liye ghaatak mana ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, it is a big challenge for the BJP to preserve its vote bank
 sarkaar ke khilaaf padidaron kaa hinsak andolanpatel samudaay kaa bijepi se naaraaz hone kaa sabase bada kaaran netritv mana gaya
 After Modi, his close Anandi Ben Patel was given the command of the state
 lekin party kii aantarik kalah or sarkaar ke virodh main yuvaaon kii aawaaj uthne lagi
 Due to the job problem, the youth started a movement against the government
 is dauraan daliton ke khilaaf atyaachaar kaa masalaa bhi bada ho gaya
 After seeing all the disintegration, the party later removed Anandiben Patel and made Vijay Rupani the chief minister
 patidaar andolan itnaa bad gaya tha ki usne hinsak rup le liya tha
 Police had to use force to handle the situation, leading to the death of many people in different places of the state
 iske baad patidaaron ne tay kiya tha ki ve 2017 ke chunaav main bijopi ko vot nahin denge
 The challenge for Hardik patel-turned-bjp is a total of 182 seats in the Gujarat Assembly
 aise main 150 siten hasil karne ke liye bijepi ko patel-patidaar samudaay ke vot kii jarurat padegi
 The biggest difficulty for the BJP in this episode may be the leader of the Patidar movement, Hardik Patel
 hardik bijepi ke khilaaf bolne se bilkul nahin chook rahe hai or wo lagaataar virdohi khemon se mil bijepi ke liye mushkilen khadaa kar rahe hai
 The Shiv Sena has even announced Hardik Patel as its chief ministerial face in Gujarat
 patel samudaay ke garh se chunavi bigul foonkaaise main bijepi ke liye patel samudaay kaa vot khaas ahmiyat rakhata he
 For this reason, the Prime Minister blew up the election bugle in Surat by holding a huge road show
 surat patel samudaay ke garh mana jaataa he
 The PM held an 11-km-long roadshow here and during this he was strongly welcomed
 surat main patel samudaay kii acchhee khaasi aabaadi he or 2015 main aarakshan andolan ke dauraan yahaan bade paimaane par hinsa hui thi
 Modi inaugurated the Rs 400 crore Kiran Multi Super Specialty Hospital and Research Center here

 apane chunaav prachaar kii shuruyaat ve 11 farvari ko jaswant nagar se karenge jahaan unke bhai or akhilesh ke chachaa shivpal yadav chunaav maidan main hai
 Akhilesh Yadav will be the next Chief Minister Mulayam Singh's statement is surprising because he himself was constantly saying that he is angry with the sp-congress alliance
 kuch hi dinon pehle unhone yahaan tak kaha tha ki samaajawaadee party ke kaaryakartaaon ko un sabhi siton par chunaav ladanaa chahie jahaan congress ke ummidavaar maidan main hai
 But it seems that by sensing the circumstances, he considered it good to forget the differences with Akhilesh Yadav
 ab mulaayam singh yadav yah kah rahe hai ki akhilesh yadav hi mukhyamantri honge
 Shivpal will not form a new party
 It is worth mentioning that a few days ago Shivpal Yadav said that he will form a new party after March 11
 lekin ab mulaayam singh yadav kah rahe hai ki shivpal yadav ko vah manaa lenge or vah nai party nahin banaaenge
 He also said that there is no difference in family now
 rang laai akhilesh kii koshishmana ja rahaa he ki mulaayam singh ke is nae you-turn ke peeche akhilesh yadav kii koshish he
 Akhilesh Yadav was constantly trying to campaign for Mulayam Singh alliance and at least not to campaign against it at all

 Mulayam Singh's credibility is also at stake because his younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav from Lucknow Cantt has contested for the first time
 kuch hi dinon pehle mulaayam singh ke chote bete pratik yadav ne bhi yahi daawa kiya tha ki parivaar main jo matbhed the vah sulajhaa liye gaye hai or ab sab kuch thik-thaak he

 Alliances have been dominant in India over the last 25 years — India's economic success and its emergence as a pillar in the multipolar world have been under the watch of alliances, such as the recent economic downturn

 This change should be good for India and also for those countries like Britain who want to do business in India and invest here
 bharat main sabase bada videshi nivesh british companiyon ne hi kiya he
 There have been a lot of bottlenecks in the Indian economy as many previous governments have had to rely on the support of fellow parties for more stubborn reform

 mukhya ummiido main se ek yah he ki nai sarkaar raajnneeti kaa lahaza badal degi

 Britain is also working on making bridges between people of Indian origin and India
 britain main bahut se logon kii soch is maamle main sakaaratmak he ki bharat kaa aarthik bhavishya ab ujjwal ho saktaa he or unhen ummid he ki ve isamen madad karne main sakasham honge, lekin ab bhi kuch sawaal bane hue hai
 First, it is clear that the new government will first and foremost focus on domestic issues
 videshi niti ke maamle main praathmik taur par bharat kaa focus apane padosi deshon par hoga

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator As part of the strategic preparations for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Congress President Rahul Gandhi met with liberal Muslim intellectuals today
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar in muslim buddhijiviyon nen rahul gandhi ko salaah di ki congress apane mul siddhanton se bhatak gai jisaki vajah se muslim samaaj congress se dur hota chalaa gaya
 Therefore, the Congress needs to return to the principles of the 60-70s
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke saath is baithak main muslim buddhijiviyon ne salaah di ki party ko community kii nahin, balki pavarty kii baat kerani chahie
 Because when Congress talks about community, the opponents get a chance to raise questions
 in buddhijiviyon kaa congress adhyaksh se kahana he ki congress main sirf 4 fisadi dadhi topi vaale muslimon kii baat hoti he jo halaala, tripal talaak jaise sansanikhej mudde uthaate hai
 But 96 percent of Muslims have the same issues as the rest of the country such as poverty, unemployment and education
 jiske baad rahul gandhi ne bhi mana kii congress se galati hui he
 Read this: The history of functioning in the Congress will change, now every month will have to be reported that taking lessons from the 2014 defeat, the Congress wants to stop the polarization of hindu-muslim votes in the upcoming elections
 iske liye rahul gandhi ne muslimon se judane ke liye un chehron ko chunaa he, jo kattarpanthi nahin balki udaaravaadi or vidwaan samajhe jate hai
 Muslim faces meeting with Rahul include social activist Shabnam Hashmi, Zoya Hasan, former vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia, Saida Hamida, and senior Supreme Court lawyer and Aligarh Muslim University alumni president ZK Faizan
 rahul is baithak ke zarie muslim samaaj ko congress se alag hone se bachaana chaahate hai
 Especially the way the Congress has been on the path of soft Hindutva for some time, this message has been sent among the Muslims that now this party will not be as vocal on their concerns as before
 baithak kaa uddeshy muslim buddhijiviyon se ye raay bhi jaananaa tha ki kaise chunavi maahaul main dhruvikaran ko roka jaae
 Rahul can also include the opinions received from these people in his party's election manifesto
 congress alpsankhyak vibhaag ke adhyaksh nadeem javed kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi un libral logon se mulaakaat karte rahenge, jinaki soch sahi disha main he
 This type of dialogue program will continue
 mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak ke baad duusari or bhi baithken hongi
 Under the changed strategy, the Congress party wants to stand apart from the Muslim fundamentalists, so that the BJP cannot benefit from this dialogue by making it an issue
 ateet main dilli ke jama masjid ke shahi imam kii sonia gandhi se mulaakaat ke baad congress baikfoot par aa gai thi
 The party no longer wants to repeat this mistake
 muslim buddhijiviyon, vichaarkon ke saath rahul ke hone vaale samvaad main itihaaskaar, lekhak, patrkaar or nyayavid sahit tamaam kshetron se log shaamil kiye jaaenge

 vahiin, pakistan ko 4 number kii pojishan tab milegi jab england kii team newjiland ko haraa degi
 If that happens, England will move to number three with 12 points
 vahiin, pakistan kii team agar bangladesh ko haraa detii he to newjiland or pakistan ke points (11-11) baraabar ho jaaenge
 But from here, Pakistan will have to win by a big margin, not just to reach the semi-finals
 tabhi mines main chal rahaa uskaa ran rate plus main pahonchega or newjiland ke ran rate ko paar kar paaegaa

 england-new Zealand may be trapped New Zealand's initial journey in the World Cup was good, but now the road ahead for him can be difficult
 newjiland ko semifinal main pahunchane ke liye england ko haraana hoga
 New Zealand currently have 11 points in the points table
 agar vah match haar jaataa he to england ke 12 point ho jaaenge or vah tisare sthaan par pahunch jaaegi
 In this situation only Pakistan's defeat to New Zealand will be able to proceed
 kyonki pakistan ke jeetne par uske 11 ank ho jaaenge, iske baad newjiland or pakistan main ran rate kii ladaai hogi
 Whoever wins in this will get a semi-final ticket

 From TV reality shows to the lobby of the Five Star Hotel, these models bring a lot of chaos wherever they go
 aisi-aisi harakatein or aise-aise drame ki dekhne vaale bhi dang rah jaaen
 They do this habitually or just to be in the headlines
 par abaki jo inhone dilli main kiya wo to vaaki ajeeb he
 In the Karol Bagh area of delhi, these are the poetic mishra who are afflicting people
 ye apni modelling ke asinaments kii vajah se kam, aisi hi ajeebogareeb harkaton kii vajah se aksar surkhiyon main rahati hai
 She first strikes someone, threatens and then immediately starts slapping
 iske baad shuru hota he puja ke chuuhe billi kaa khel, jisamen wo ek shaks kaa peechha karne ke baad uski dhunaai bhi kar detii hai
 But is it a coincidence? Are Pooja excessively hyper? Or is there someone who is behind the worship? After all, what is the secret of such sentences with Pooja? At midnight at 2:40 am, Pooja was standing at a puja counter in a twenty-seven-hour-old store when she was told by some boys standing behind her
 
 maamle main tab pehali baar twist aata he, jab wo pehle to chappal utaar kar ladakon ko dhamkati he or phir achaanak hi apane bag sepistal nikaal karaladakon par taan detii hai kuch der ko liye to sabhi peeche hat jate hai
 But as soon as Pooja puts the pistol in her bag, the bet turns back again
 vahaan maujuud ek shaks ne puure ghatnakram ko apane mobile phone main kaid kar liya
 Pictures show that from behind Pooja, voices of constant screaming and abusive speech are being heard
 itane main puja bhi palatati hai or apane mobile phone par kisi se baat karti hui ye bataane lagati hai ki ye shor-sharaaba unke kuch aise phens kar rahe hai, jo jhoparpatti ke hai
 But this thing passes exasperated to the boys present there and they move towards worship
 wo kehete hai ki wo unke fain nahin hai
 Do not be worshiped in any wrong way and on seeing it, it increases
 ladakon ko dekhakar ashleel ishaare kar rahi thi modeltaish main aakar puja ladakon kii ore dekh kar pehle to ashleel ishaare karti hai or phir kareeb aae ek ladke ko laat maarane kii koshish karti hai
 Now the boy starts threatening Pooja
 lekin puja kahaan maanane vaali hai
 Instead, she gives a shower of abuses and slaps
 haalanki kai thappadon ke baad bhi ladkaa puja par haath nahin chodta balki vah ye kah kar chetavanee dene kii koshish karata he ki wo auraton ke upar haath nahin uthaata
 But the actions of Pooja continue and kick the boy
 iske baavjood wo ladkaa to kuch nahin karata, lekin uskaa ek saathi puja ko dhakka jarur de detaa he
 In the meantime, Puja's strange sentiments, abuses and vulgar gestures go on
 ab tak store ke karmchaaree bich main aa jate hai or wo ladakon ko khinch kar store se baahar kii ore le jane lagate hai
 But Pooja is not calm, but tries to kick the boys out of the store again
 iske baad baari aati he, uski jo mobile se ye video shoot kar rahaa hota he
 Pooja first tries to snatch the mobile and then abuses her if she fails
 ek maheene pehle hotel main bhar chukin hai aisa kandagali-galouj, marpet, dhakka-mukki se hota hua aadhi raat kaa ye hai voltage drama apane anjaam tak pahunchataa he
 About a month ago, the same model Pooja Mishra did in a luxurious five-star hotel in Delhi was no less shocking
 yahaan bhi pehle puja ne hotel ke ek mulajim kaa mobile todaa or phir baakiyon kii pitayee kii
 Even then there was a lot of ruckus due to his antics
 puja mishra, jinke naam ab aise marpet or hangaamon ke ek nahin, balki kai kirtiman darj ho chuke hai
 There was a charge of not paying, the hoteliers have a complaint about the payment of bill from Pooja
 jisaki vajah se hotel ke mulajim hotel chhod kar jane ke dauraan puja kii videography kar rahe hai lekin puja marpet par utaaru ho jaati hai
 As soon as Pooja arrives at the hotel and slaps the hotel attendant, the other personnel ask their security guard Kam Bel Boy to go inside with Pooja's suitcase
 security guard ulte paanv hotel main waapas lautataa he lekin puja chillaati hui uskaa peechha karne lagati hai
 And the effect of this shouting is that the security guard falls down with the suitcash and then Pooja is accounted once again
 is baar wo security guard par tut padati hai or unhen buree tarah peetane lagati hai
 In fact, according to the hotel guests, Pooja Mishra had broken many things in her room during her stay and when she tried to take account of these things during billing, she ran away and assaulted her
 ye or baat he ki puja aise tamaam iljaamon ko sire se khaarij karti hai balki unka to kahana he ki unhen jaanboojh kar sataaya jaataa he
 Puja Mishra, who gave safety tips to the girls on the pretext of ruckus, always says that it is not their motive to create a ruckus, it just creates a ruckus
 wo bhi bina unki galati ke
 Like Pooja says about the midnight ruckus in a Delhi store, this ruckus was actually the result of flirting with her
 unka to yahaan tak kahana he ki kisi bhi ladki ke saath jab bhi aisa ho to use bhi aisa hi karnaa chahie jaisaa unhone kiya
 The family members of the maid, along with hundreds of others, attacked the society on Wednesday morning after a family members living in Mahagun Modern Apartments located in Sector 78 area of noida police station Sector 49 attacked the society And threw stones
 maamle main naukaraani ne apni malkin sahit kai logon ko namit karte hue thana sector 49 main mukadmaa darj karaayaa he or saath hi mahagun modern apartment socity ne bhi 100 se zyada agyaat logon ke khilaaf maamla darj karaayaa he
 Since this incident, people of all the major societies of Delhi NCR have been scared
 sabhi ke man me yahi khauf he ki kahi aisi ghatana unke saath bhi na ho jaae
 The people of this posh society located in Sector 78 of Noida, Prateik Wisteria Apartment, Noida
 inako dar he ki gharelu sahaayta ke liye naukaraaniyon ko gharon main daakhila dena kahin baari na pad jaae
 Most of the young couples in the society work in offices and elderly parents in the houses get the house cleaning done by the maids
 jinke paas na topulice veriphicationhota he or na hi koi pahchaan patr
 In such a situation, they now see their security at risk
 isi socity ke rahane vaale 68 saal ke vijay khullar kaa kahana he ki ve ab soch main pad gaye hai ki in par bharosa kaise karen, ve ghar main akele rahete hai
 He says that he saw the previous maid stealing money from the purse herself but could not speak out of fear
 dar tha ki kahin wo mujh par yon shoshan kaa aarope na laga de
 Now it is helpless to use them in this old age, but now the situation is not really right
 dwarka , pragatisheel apartmentnoida kii tarah hi dwarka bhi puri tarah rihaishi ilaaka he
 65-year-old Rita Ahuja, who lives in a progressive apartment in many big posh societies here, believes that at this age, work does not work
 betaa-bahu donon kaam par jate hai
 In such a situation, keeping a maid at home is more helpless than necessary
 wo kahati hai, mahagun jaisi posh socity main aisi ghatana ghatane ke baad suraksha bada sawaal he
 Now they are also afraid to interrupt their mistakes
 sector 47, gudgaanvadilli se sate gudgaanv main bhi desh bhar se aae yuva behatar bhavishya kaa sapana le kar aate hai
 In every sector of Gurgaon, young couples live in rented houses and most of these couples are working
 gharon main saaf-safai or khaanaa banane kaa kaam bhi yahaan naukaraaniyaan karti hai
 Inderpreet lives with his wife in Sector-46, Gurgaon
 unka kahana he ki pehle to yahaan maid milti nahin, agar mil bhi jaae to unke rates aasmaan chune vaale hote hai
 Here the maids work together in ten houses each
 koi dacuments nahin, koi idi pruf nahin
 It is a compulsion to keep them
 gharelu naukaraaniyaan har ghar kii jarurat hai par maujuuda halaat main rihaishi ilaakon main rahane vaale logon ke man me inako lekar sawaal uthne bhi laazmi hai

 Second, if you don't have anything good to say, you should keep your mouth shut, because you don't know what happened to it
 ye samasya sirf mahilaon ke saath nahin purushon ke saath bhi he
 If someone says to you at 2 in the night that i come to my room, i have a role for you, then you are a fool
 aapako apane dimag kaa istemaal karnaa chahie
 "when Preeti was asked if she was ever cast in college or when she was new in films, she was castigated by a casting couch or something like that? In response, she said-" If i had this, i would have given a code khushnaseebi he ki aisa kuch nahin hua
 "legal betting should be done in cricket," he said, adding that he believed the bookmaker should be legal
 iske peeche priti ne apana logic bhi diya
 Preeti says that betting can get the government to revise
 bisisiai bhi ise legal kiye jane kaa suzav de chukaa he
 See, you cannot test every person's lie detector
 logon ke andar pakade janaa kaa dar hota he
 If you happen to be a bastard, it won't change as i say
 "baahar hona chaahati thi 'kya kahana' sepriti jinta bataaya ki unki pehali filmakya kehanaakaa anubhav kaisaa rahaa
 Preeti Zintane said that she wanted to come back abroad, upset with the film, where it was being shot
 iske baad nirdeshak kundan shah un par kaaphi chillaaye or unhen rokane ke liye unhone get band kar liye

 Mr
 Rajput Karni Sena, a small organization of Rajputs, has won the battle, at least for now, and has forced producers Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Bhansali Productions to postpone the film's release
 karani sena ke mukhiya lokentre singh kaalvi hai jo philhal bhaajapa ke sadsy or divangat kendriya mantri kalyaan singh kaalvi ke bete hai
 The filmmaker insists that Padmavati "embodies the bravery, dignity and tradition of the Rajputs with its full aura and radiance and this film will" fill every Hindustani with pride
 " bhartiya cinema ko yah jhatka tab laga he jab smriti irani kii aguai main soochna-prasaaran mantralay goa main bhartiya antarrashtriya film mahotsav main bhartiya or vishwa cinema kaa utsav manaa rahaa he

 One queen, a heroine for all, extinguishes all the poison, hi-taaba and at the center of protest is Rani Padmini, who was the Rajput queen of Chittor narrated in the story
 unhen hindustan kii helen of troy bhi kaha ja saktaa he, jisaki mashhoor khubsuurati samrajya par hamale kaa sabab bataai jaati he
 It is said that he set himself ablaze in the 13th century to save his honor from Alauddin Khilji, the Sultan of Delhi, an Iyash attacker - a practice known as Jauhar

 There is no historical evidence that Khilji attacked Chittor for Padmini's sake, not just to increase his sultanate
 pratishthit itihaaskaar banarsi prasad saxena ne likhaa he ki kis tarah amir khusro, jiyauddin barani or abdul malik isami or us jamaane ke duusare itihaaskaaron ne padmini ke hone kaa koi zikr nahin kiya he

" " padmini ke 37wein sage vashanj hone kaa daawa karne vaale kaalvi iske jawaab main kehete hai, ''agar padmini kalpana thi to aisa kaise he ki main asal charitra hum? agar vah kalpana thi, to ek raashtrapati, do pradhanmantri or 15 mukhyamantri padmini pales (chittorgadh kile ke) main kyon aae or unke smarak par sir jhukaaya?" padmini / padmavati kii kinvadanti unki mashhoor khudakushi se kahin aage jaati he
 Retired professor of religious studies in the US, Lindsay Harlan, in her book Religion and Rajput Womenru The Ethic of Protection in Contemporary Narratives, explores why Padmini is so glorified
 ve bataati hai ki lokapriy kinvadanti main yah padmini kii bahaduree or dilari hi thi jisaki vajah se vah khilji ke haathon kaid kar liye jane ke baad apane pati ko bachaane ke liye ek karrwai kaa mansuba banaati he
 "going out for war," writes Harlan, "he laid bare the customs associated with women and performed the duty of men
" mard ke ilaake main kadam rakhte hue usne apane pati kii kaman sambhaal lee
 Padmini is not the bold heroine because she plays the default role of a husband (dutiful wife), but she is the bold heroine because she moves away from this role to take on another, more important role
 " udhar, lokapriy amar chitrakatha comic kii ''glorious heritage of india" shrunkhlaa ke ek hisse padmini main unhen ''hindustani nari kii mukammal model" ke taur par bakhaan kiya he
 In a series of interviews for her book, a symbol of Hindu pride, Harlan asked Rajput women why they worship Padmini so much
 ek ne kaha, ''main padmini ko isliye maanati hum ki kyonki vah bahut chatur thi; usne musalamaanon ko bhi yah dikhaa diya!" zyaadaatar ke liye lokgatha main padmini kii bahaduree ko is tarah bataaya gaya he jisamen vah duusare aadmi kii, jo ittefaq se duusare majahab kaa taqatvar raja he, bandhak yaa begum banane kii bajaae mar janaa pasand karti he
 Ramya Srinivasan, professor of religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania, in her book The Many Lives of a Rajput Queen, recounts how Padmini's new interpretation of the bureaucracy is "rajput" and now "when confronted with the Muslim Fatah"
 "hindu patriotism" is cited as an example
 ve likhti hai, ''18veen sadi aate-aate rajasthan main is afsane main fatah hasil karne vaale dushman ko achaanak murtibhanjak, malachh musalmaan kii daanvi shakl main pesh kiya jane laga
 "srinivasan's book indicates that not only Rajputs but other Hindu groups also adopted Padmini as an example of Hindu might

 The irony is that Bhansali's film art from Goliyon Rasleelaru ram-leela (gujarat) to Bajirao Mastani rests on his ability to present Indian culture and tradition with its full aura
 film nirdeshak ne apni pratishtha bhavy or aaleeshaan drishy rachane or bahut baariki se filmaae nrity or gaanon kii apni pratibha ke dam par banaai he

 Paris did not catch fire, but Bhansali's film adaptation in his country, Hindustan, angered the ruling BJP members, as evidenced by the dreaded violent threats by the party's media coordinator Suraj Pal Amu in Haryana (he beheaded Deepika 10 crore to the doer
 kaa inaam dene kii peshkash kii)

 Are there also concerns that just as the Joker faded Batman, in the same way as Bhansali's film, the flamboyant Khilji can steal the show? At first glance, Padmini's fantasy of Bhansali seems to be stubborn
 Director Shyam Benegal calls our stories a "mythical appearance"

 In Jaha Ara district, a girlfriend tried to kill the old lover in a new love affair
 lekin is koshish main premika or uskaa nayaa aashiq police ke hathe chadh gaye
 This heartbreaking case is of Ara railway station
 jharkhand ke devgarh nivasee aryaa naamak ladki kaa do ladakon ke saath prem prasang chal rahaa tha
 One of her was her old boyfriend Manish while a new lover is Ankit

 The match between India and England on the first day of Mumbai test is almost equal
 toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne vaali england team ne stamps ke samay tak paanch wicket par 288 ran bana liye hai
 The credit for leading England to this position goes to Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who took three quick wickets in the last session to force the visiting team to take a defensive stance
 aswin ne is seshan main set ho chuke ballebaajon, kiton jenings or moin ali ke alaava khatarnaak johny beresto ko pavilion lautaaya
 In the first two sessions, where England opener Keaton Jennings and his century were named in the debut test, the last session Ashwin raised his hopes for India by his name
 is lihaaj se kal, duusare din lunch ke pehle tak kaa khel ahm ho saktaa he
 If Team India was successful in taking a few wickets at the beginning of the game, then their upper hand could be heavy but if England managed to get their score to 400 or beyond then the pressure would be on Team India
 apana khaataa kholane ke pehle hi umesh yadav kii gend par gali main karun nair ko kathin mauka dene vaale jenings ne sadhi hui pari kheli
 Injured mo shami ke sthaan par plaing ilevan main shaamil kiye gaye bhubaneshwar kumaar aaj gendbaaji ke dauraan apni lay main nahin dikhe, iskaa kaaran shaayad pari kii shuruyaat main hi danger jone main daudane ke liye unhen ampaire se mili varning rahaa
 After this, Jennings opened his hands and also took excellent shots
 (padhein, aswin ne liye 4 wicket, england kii aadhi team pavilion lauti)tippaniyan Ravindra Jadeja brought his first success to the team a little before lunch when England's opening pair looked to be a problem for India
 lunch ke ekadam pehle unhone cook ko stumpar karakar bhartiya kheme ko raahat di
 Despite this, the first session remained in England's name and at lunch, the team's score was 117 for one wicket
 duusare seshan main bhi yahi kahani rahi or bharat ke hisse main jo root kaa wicket hi aayaa
 After England's rout of 136 (21) was dismissed by England, jennings-moeen lately denied Team India the next success
 chaaykaal tak england kaa score do wicket par 196 ran tha or team bade score kii ore badhati najar aa rahi thi
 Team India bounced back with Ashwin in the third session
 bhartiya of spinner ke khilaaf aakraamak rukh akhriyaar karne kaa khamiyaja moin ne bhugta
 In the same over, Ashwin gave the Indian team the success they were eagerly waiting for by dismissing Jennings
 aswin yaheen nahin ruke
 He was dismissed by wicketkeeper batsman Johnny Bairstro, who performed brilliantly this year
 paanch wicket 249 ran par girane ke baad ben stokes or josh butler ne dames control kaa kaam karte hue bina koi or wicket ganvaae score 280 ke paar pahunchaa diya
 According to the curator of Wankhede, the wicket has started helping spinners from evening or third day on the second day
 aise main bhartiya spin tikdi par har kisi kii nigahen tiki hongi

 The fragrance of the new alliance in Bihar has intensified
 jis narendra modi ke naam par nitish kumaar ne khud ko bijepi se alag kar liya, usee modi ke haath majboot karne kaa bidaa ab nitish ke puraane saathiyon ne uthaa liya he
 Now Upendra Kushwaha will replace Nitish with BJP in Lok Sabha elections, who will combine his new party Rashtriya Lok Samata Party with BJP
 haalanki gathbandhan kaa aupchaarik elaan nahin hua he, lekin donon dalon ke bich gathbandhan par lagbhag sahmati ban chuki he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak in Patna, Upendra Kushwaha said that a very backward person has come as Prime Minister in the form of Narendra Modi, which he supports
 unhone kaha, 'narendra modi ati pichde samaaj ke netaa hai
 Bihar BJP has proposed to make him Prime Minister
 main samajhataa hum ki bihar ne aisa karke saamaajik nyaay kaa sammaan kiya he
 Nitish Kumar, whether it is at the state level or at the country level, does not want any backward leader to be established
 'haalanki abhi donon dalon ke bich baatcheet kaa daur jari he, lekin ummid he ki jald hi bijepi or lok samta party kaa gathbandhan hoga, jisase bihar main bijepi ko ek saajheedaar milegaa
 Upendra Kushwaha praised Narendra Modi as the most backward leader, then it became clear that now both the parties are preparing to walk together in the name of Modi
 upendra kushvaha, pichhadi jati se aate hai, jisaki taadaad bihar main kaaphi he or nitish ke vot bank main send laga saktaa he
 In fact, under the new strategy, the responsibility of playing Modi's backward card will be on the shoulders of Upendra Kushwaha and his party, so that Nitish Kumar's votes can be breached
 narendra modi ke naam par bihar main nae dhruvikaran ke sanket pehle se hi hai
 Arun Kumar, state president and former MP of Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, clearly stated that Modi is the future of the country and the party would like to complete the formalities of coordination as soon as possible
 arun kumaar yaheen nahin ruke
 He said, 'just as before JDU was with BJP, now we will be
 jediu ke zyaadaatar log hamaare saath hai
 The stream of socialism is with us
 aaj desh ko jarurat he jabanj, pragatisheel yuva pradhanmantri kii or wo narendra modi main he
 BJP definitely becomes a natural relationship for us, because we have been working with the BJP, keeping pace
 party modi ko puri tarah secular maanati he
 It was about communalism allegations, so yesterday when we, Nitish and George were with BJP, we were also accused of communalism
 'udhar bihar bijepi ne bhi is nae ubharate gathbandhan ke pukhta hone kaa sanket de diya he
 Leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly Nandkishore Yadav said that if partners like Upendra Kushwaha meet, the party will welcome it and in the coming time this alliance may take shape
 udhar jediu ne upendra kushvaha ko janadharviheen qaraar dete hue kaha he ki aise netaaon or partiyon ke bijepi ke saath gathbandhan se jediu kii sehat par koi fark nahin padataa
 Party General Secretary and State Spokesperson Ajay Alok said, 'BJP is choosing the leaders and parties thrown in the dustbins which have no political status left
 isse jediu ko nuksaan kii bajaae phayda hi hoga
 In the name of Modi, Kushwaha will openly join the BJP, the signs are clear
 sutron ke mutabik bihar main gathbandhan kii taiyaari sidhe narendra modi ke daftar se chal rahi he
 Apart from Upendra Kushwaha and Jehanabad's former MP Arun Kumar, the current JDU MP Jayanarayan Nishad is a leader like Purnamasi Ram, who can join the BJP
 vivaad se punam pandey kaa purana naata he
 The actor and model, who claimed to have taken off clothes after Team India won the World Cup in 2011, created a ruckus by posting a post on Twitter
 fifa world cap khumaar main dubi punam pandey ne twitor par post ke jariye anouns kiya ki agar brazil jeetta he to wo apni bra dengi
 However, she did not disclose that she would do so if Brazil won the semi-final match or the title

 unhen anguthi, chuudi, bracelate, hair band, hair clip, earing, scorf, dhoop kaa chashma pahanane yaa purse, yahaan tak ki pani kii bottle le jane kii chhot nahin hogi
 You have every right to be amazed at this absurd arrangement of CBSE to stop cheating in the country's most prestigious medical examination, but it should also be surprising that the BJP, which came to power with the legacy of Vyapam scam, did the major examinations in the last one year
 It was not considered appropriate to be serious on improving the condition
 shiksha main sudhaar main samay lag saktaa he lekin parikshaon kaa dhaancha thik karne ke liye pataa nahin sarkaar ko rajyasabha main kis bahumat kii darkaar he?desh main naukariyaan hai hi kitni? unamem bhi sarkari naukariyaan to or bhi kam hai
 In the last four years alone, around 20 examinations and recruitment in the states of North India have been canceled due to scams or are stuck in the courts
 sarkari parikshaon or bhartee main farjivada na sirf rojgaar roktaa he balki jaruri sevaaon main karmchaariyon kii kami banaakar rakhata he jo bhrashtachar kii ek or badi vajah he
 Despite the huge bureaucracy and all the techniques, if the central and state governments also cannot clear their selected examinations and recruitments, then we should take a fresh look at the pink debates of education, because government jobs and their examinations are a vast landscape of education Does not even have one percent share
 sarkari naukariyon ke liye parikshaayen or bhartee bharat kaa sabase purana sangathit ghotaalaa he
 The most unique aspect of this is that no major policy planning is needed to improve it
 kshamtaayen badhaakar, takanic laakar or paardarshita ke sakht niyam banaakar is lut va sharmindagi ko aasaani se roka ja saktaa he
 For example, take the medical examination itself
 50,000 siton ke liye lakhon parikshaarthi sangharsh karte hai or safalataa kaa anupaat 0
 Less than 5 percent
 agle paanch saal main desh main paryaapt medical siten nahin banane kaa mishan aakhir kitna mahangaa ho saktaa he? khaas taur par jab modi sarkaar arabon kii laagat vaale mishan har maheene shuru kar rahi he
 We had hoped that the government may not be bothered about the scam in cricket, but at least it will not hesitate in the cases of recruitment in scams, fraud of medical colleges, donation games, fake university investigations because BJP intellectuals know the reason for this merge
 is
 sawaal poochna jaruri he ki sarkaar ne pichley ek saal main medical, technical shiksha or nijee bhagidaari ke model ko chust karne ke liye kya kiya jo ki har tarah kii lut-khasot se bharaa he
 India is the country with the highest number of medical colleges in the world, but there are neither enough seats nor enough doctors, because the average number of seats in medical colleges is 100 to 150
 bade college banaakar na keval medical siton kaa khudara bazaar band ho saktaa he balki medical shiksha main farjivada bhi ruk saktaa he
 Similarly, there is an imbalance of fewer jobs and more trained in MBA and engineering
 yah apeksha karnaa galat nahin tha ki soochna takanic kii sambhaavnaaon par hameshaa rijhane vaali sarkaar desh main sabhi sarkari parikshaon ko online karaane kaa mishan shuru karegi
 The system of issuing degrees will be linked to biometric so that the entire system of fake degrees can be shut down
 yaa naukariyon, prashikshan kii kshamtaaon, collejon or institute ko aapas main jodakar ek vishaal databes banegaa jo ek clic par shiksha se lekar naukariyon tak kii tasviir bataa sakegaa
 Actually, this is what we need for Digital India
 lekin desh ko digital banane ke naam par sarkari prachaar dikhaane vaale mobile aplication thama die gaye hai
 There is no looking for Pluto in the space to get all the exams online or to connect all the degrees with modern digital security, from medical, engineering to administrative and banking
 sirf ek bade takneekee mishan se paper li, solver, nakal, farji praaanpatron kaa puraa tantra khatm ho saktaa he
 There is a joke among education practitioners that if someone has taken a degree during the last two decades, then it is possible to join fifty percent of the people whose degrees are fake or have passed the exam from Jugaad
 yadi aisa nahin he to vah donneton dekar bhartee hua hoga yaa uski pariksha kaa parchaa li hua hoga
 If it is not there, then he must have studied at least in a college that is of a high standard
 yaa use sarkari skool main kisi aise teacher ne padhaayaa hoga jo rishwat dekar naukari main aayaa
 Overall, scams in education are not as spicy as cricket, as they have become a part of our daily lives
 sarkari bhartiyon or parikshaon main har tarah kii dhaandhlee se bhaleebhanti waakif bijepi bhi agar inhen sudhaarney ke liye kuch nahin kar paa rahi he to modi sarkaar ke khilaaf congress jaisi shadyantr kathaayen bananaa lajimi he
 In the midst of dreams of making India a world guru, if students can have to take clothes off for a clean medical examination here, then we have to stop the flight of expectations
 shiksha or rojgaar kii badi bahason ke liye hamaare paas vakt he, pehle ham un lakhon yuvaaon kii phikr kar len jo naukariyaan to chhodie, saaf-suthri parikshaon ke bhi mohataaj ho chuke hai
 Hundreds of salutes to the Prime Minister's dream of making India the best human resource center in the world! But for the time being, if the government exams can be neat and clean, then it will be a big favor of the Prime Minister on those youths who have gone to some extent by reading the scramble and want to get something in their life honestly, due to their ability
 namaskara main raveesh kumaar
 
 
 i wish leaders like me would get some rest on issues going on leave
 is chunaav main pataa hi nahin chal rahaa he ki koun sa practice match he or koun sa final
 But according to me the player is the one who takes his ball between the opposing camp and from there moves towards the goalpost
 aaj bihar kii raajnneetik jameen par aisa hi kuch hua
 The politics of Hindustan, which was trying to take the lead in the twenty-first century, has left its principles and has come to practical ground, where one is creating caste equations from the back door, one is defying the front
 raajnneeti main sameekaran se bada praadhikaran nahin he or jati se bada koi gathbandhan nahin he or gathbandhan main jatiyaan sthai nahin hoti hai
 Modi and BJP have begun to break into anti-alliances and smaller parties
 ve aisa daanv chal chuke hai, jisase bihar main upie bharbhara gai he
 Chirag, son of Ram Vilas Paswan, who resigned during the 2002 riots, continued to make the same statement throughout the day that after the clean chit of the Supreme Court, the riots did not stain
 yah nahin kaha ki congress lalu ke saath jane ke liye ab bhi taiyaar hai
 Paswan could also go with Nitish, but Modi flew away
 antim faisla jo ho magar unhen modi se koi dikkat nahin he
 By the time Lalu went to jail, Paswan was seen standing with Lalu Yadav's family
 unki party ke teen hi vidhayak hai, lekin unki jati kaa chah se saat fisadi vot kisi ke bhi kaam aa saktaa he
 Just yesterday, the BJP has tied up with Rashtriya Samata Party leader Upendra Kushwaha in Bihar
 kushvaha jati chah fisadi he
 In UP too, Anupriya Patel, daughter of Kurmi Samaj leader Sone Lal Patel, is preparing to go with BJP
 is tarah se bijepi ne jati se jeet kaa sameekaran bananaa shuru kar diya he
 It is being talked about by the BJP, therefore, who does not create caste equations and why will not
 jis kaagaj par modi ko gathbandhan kii raajnneeti or bihar upi main peeche bataaya ja rahaa tha, usee kaagaj par unhone puraane samikarnon par apni pencil se katpit kar di he
 This evening a news came from Patna that Lalu sat in Delhi and went to Sakpaka
 ab ve party ko sanbhaalane kal subah patna ja rahe hai
 Lalu Yadav's party has split among the RJD mlas
 isaki ghoshnaa ke liye aaj kaa hi din chunaa gaya
 When the RJD mlas gave the petition to the speaker on the 14th, even then Lalu did not know
 aaj hi unke baagi vidhayak kyon camere ke saamne aae or aaj hi spikar ne alag dal kii manyata kyon di
 It is another matter that six mlas have also returned
 lekin yah nitish kii taraf se aisi gugali thi, jisase congress-argedy kaa gathbandhan mushkil main funs gaya
 Nitish also expressed that if Modi can take Paswan, then he can rob the Lalu camp itself
 argedy kaa kahana he ki galat tareeke se dastakhat pesh kiye gaye hai
 All this will continue to happen, but what has happened is telling what is going to happen
 haal hi main jab mantri parveen amanullah istipha dekar aam aadmi party main gayi to kaha gaya ki musalmaan nitish ke saath nahin hai, lekin kya is baghawat se nitish ne apni daavedaari majboot kii he
 Paswan says that there was no riot on Modi and the rebel MLA of RJD says that the flag of secularism in Bihar is only with Nitish
 jati ke naam par teji se banate samikarnon ke baad survey waalon ko phir se survey karnaa chahie
 On the other hand, BJP has become aggressive on another level after giving a jolt to Nitish and Congress Lalu
 dalit vot bank
 Today, Udit Raj joined BJP after finding his own land in politics by forming an organization of Scheduled Caste and Tribe officers and later Justice Party for years
 paswan ke baad udit raaj
 Although the basis of Udit Raj, who accepts Buddhism, except Hinduism, may not be visible on the ground, he is a Dalit face in the media world
 udit raaj ko jitna jaanata hum unki raajnneeti main ek hi nirantarata rahi he, vah he mayawati kaa virodh
 Opponents have also been Paswan
 lekin mayawati ko inase kabhi chunauti nahin mili
 Nitish made a Mahadalit collage in the last election to round up Paswan
 mayawati ne haal hi main sansad main or lakhanu kii raily main kaha tha ki modi ko pradhanmantri nahin banane denge
 Modi answered this at a rally in Gorakhpur as to why BJP won 69 out of 79 reserved seats in the assembly elections of four states
 to ab ladaai jati ke kheme main ghus kar hone ja rahi he
 Modi kept calling himself and his party backward, so that the backward would be mobilized
 kerala main modi ne khud ke raajnneetik anubhav ko daliton ke saath hue bhedbhaav se jod diya
 They are changing fast and making their move fast
 dangon ko lekar dhur virdohi rahe paswan ko bhi apni paale main lene main nahin hichakate or mayawati ko chunauti dene main bhi sankoch nahin karte
 BJP Dalit Morcha president Sanjay Paswan writes a book on Jagjivan Ram and says that Hindutva was in his blood

 mumbai main chori chhipe tahkhaanon or band kamaron ke andar chal rahe dance baron ko aakhirkaar khuli hawa main saans lene kii ijaajat mil hi gai
 For the last eight years, the section of Bombay Police Act, which banned dance bars in Mumbai, was declared wrong by the country's largest court
 dance baar ke ab phir se gulzaar hone ke baad jaahir he tahkhaanon main chal rahe dance baar ab jaldi hi tahkhaane main hi dafan ho jaaenge
 The dance bar of Mumbai, which had been closed for eight years, had grown such a basement from inside that the eyes of the viewers were torn
 jamaane ke liye dance baar band ho chukaa tha par hukka baar, bear baar or naa jane kis-kis baar ke naam par dance baar ab bhi jinda tha
 The only difference was that the chirping girls of the dance bar were now lifted from the floor to the basement
 sara dhandha ab bhulbhulaiya jaise raaston, kamaron or suranganuma tahkhaanon main utar aayaa tha
 When the business reached the black cellar from the open dance floor, the business's soot also became black
 dance ke naam par tahkhaanon main jismfaroshi kaa dhandha teji se phalne-phoolne laga
 In the name of obscenity and law and order, the Maharashtra government had stopped the dance bar eight years ago, it was never completely closed
 khule baar ke mukaable band baron main ashleelata zyada parosi jane lagi thi
 Now that the Supreme Court has already decided to re-dance the closed dance bars, it is clear that the death of these cellars is certain because now all the dance bars in Mumbai will once again come out of the cellars and come to the upper floor
 dance baar band hone ke baad vahaan kaam karne vaali 70 hajaar se zyada ladkiyaan berogari ke chalate desh-videsh main fail gai thim
 Many of them were forced to venture down to the business of prostitution
 ab wo bhi dobaaraa khuleam saamne aakar apni rozi-roti kama sakati hai or yahi sabase badi vajah thi jise pehle mumbai hai court or phir desh kii sabase badi adaalat yani supreme court ne mana or maharashtra sarkaar ke aath saal puraane faisle ko palatate hue hukum de diya ki ab dance baar phir se gulzaar honge
 The loud music, the glittering light and the melting melody in the frame
 ab se koi saat saal pehle ye tasviir mumbai kii jindagi kaa ek ahm hissaa hua karti thi
 Then there would hardly have been a night in Mayanagari, when such a gathering was empty of candles, but in 2005, what the Maharashtra government changed to the Bombay Police Act, Mumbai's dance bars came under darkness
 daleel thi dance baron main chal rahi or ashleelata or baar kii aad main chalate duusare gair-kanoonee dhandhe
 This decision of the government not only tied the hands and feet of the hotel and restaurant owners, but also made it difficult for the living to face the dancer more than 70 thousand times
 ab baat loar court se shuru se hokar hai court ke galiyaaron se hoti hui hindustan kii sabase badi adaalat tak ja pahunchi
 Meanwhile, due to the stay order of the Supreme Court, the lock in the dance bars kept hanging
 lekin aakhirkaar supreme court ne dance baron par apana faisla sunaaya
 It was a decision to win over hunger over vulgarity, it was a decision to choose any profession at your own will and live with your head raised, and now in this joy, the dance bars of Mumbai will once again blossom
 darasal, saal 2005 main maharashtra sarkaar ne bambe police act main do dharaaen section 33e or bi ko shaamil kiya
 According to 33A, every kind of dance was banned in any beer bar, eating house or restaurant, while in 33B, dance performance was allowed in three star or more expensive hotels, because the government believed that these dance bars Under the guise, other wrong businesses are going on in Mumbai, including slum
 sarkaar ne bataaya tha ki roak ke vakt tak mumbai main chal rahe kul 2845 dance baron main se sirf 345 baar hi licenseshuda the, jabaki 2500 baar bina license ke hi chal rahe the
 However, many social organizations, including restaurant and bar owners, opposed the Maharashtra government's decision, calling it against the constitution and the right to live, and finally the Supreme Court affirmed it
 mumbai ke dance baar kii hakeekat kuch aisi he, unki kahani kuch aisi he, jisko bollywood ne bhi bade parde par pesh kiya
 The life of bar dancers is probably better than the open sky in these walls of compulsion
 kam ye kam yahaan unka pet to thik se palata he
 Otherwise, the truth of bar dancers does not come to light after the closure of the bar
 puure maharashtra main dance baar band hone se kareeb 75 hajaar ladkiyaan berozegaar ho gai thim
 The rate was wandering to pay for the pet
 ab unhen phir se thikaane kii aas mili he, or roji-roti kaa zariyaa mila he
 a law of Maharashtra government changed the lights of dance bars in Mumbai, more than 70 thousand girls working in these bars were covered in darkness
 ek baar dancer ke tag ke saath jindagi kitni dushwaar ho sakati he, ye in ladakiyon ko saal 2006 main pehali baar tab pataa chalaa jab mumbai main dance baron par kanoon kaa shikanja kasne laga
 Some times where they were shut down after losing the situation, many times they started walking in the cellars by giving some to the uniformed people or escaping from their eyes, but in this war of law and life, if anyone has suffered the most, then this It was only the bar girls whose dance bars used to be upbeat
 dance baron main kaam karanevaali ladakiyon main 68 fisadi ladkiyaan to aisi thim, jo apane parivaar main akeli kamaane vaali thi or aise main dance baron ke band hone se unke saamne guzar-basar kii kisi musiibat khadi hui, ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 People also took advantage of this helplessness of girls
 haseen zindagi ke khwab dikhaa kar jahaan saikadon dance baron ko maanav taskaron ne unke baron se uthaa kar sidhe dubai samet duusare khadi deshon main shekhon ke haram tak pahunchaa diya, vahiin aisi baar balaayein bhi kam nahin thi, jinhen laachaargi main jismfaroshi kaa rasta chunanaa padaa
 Not all girls working in dance bars were from Mumbai
 lihaaja kaam band ho jane par kai ladakiyon ne apane-apane gharon kaa rukh kiya, lekin yahaan bhi baar dancer ke tag ne unka peechha nahin choda or aakhirkaar zyaadaatar ladakiyon ne jismfaroshi ke dhandhe ke saath hi samjhauta karnaa padaa
 You will remember that after this every year, especially on New Year's occasions, whenever there was a news of raids on the grounds of Jismfaroshi from almost every corner of the country, bar dancers were mentioned
 udhar, chori chhipe mumbai ke tahkhaanon main naach rahi ladakiyon kii haalat bhi acchhee nahin rahi or ashleelata ke khilaaf bane is ek kanoon ne ladakiyon ko band kamare ke andar wo sabakuch karne ke liye majaboor kar diya, jo koi bhi ladki apane liye khwaabon main bhi nahin sochna chaahegi lekin ab supreme court ke faisle ne ek baar phir se nai ummid jagaai he

 Here he said in an interview to The Indian Express that while the controversy was going on between Hrithik and Kangana, Kangana was filming Rangoon with him
 har din hi kangana or rithik ko lekar akhabaaron main kuch na kuch chhapata tha
 But Kangana still used to come on shoot everyday

 He did not ask to cancel a single day's shoot
 kangana kii controvarsi par karan ne diya jawaab, kaha- istemaal ho rahi hai kanganavishaal ne yahaan tak kaha ki kangana puri tarah profeshnal hai

 vishaal ne ye bhi kaha ki unki jagah koi or kalakaar hota, to shaayad unhen film kii shooting rokani pad jaati
 So due to this, Kangana is sitting silent on the statements of Ranaut, Hrithik Roshan! Was flopped at the box office, please tell me that Rangoon is Kangana's last release film

 Vishal Bhardwaj was also being told this dream project

 Then it was said that Kangana is not being formed even with Vishal Bhardwaj
 haalanki ab jis tarah vishaal ne kangana ke bare main pratikriya di he, usase to yahi lagata he ki un donon ke bich koi vivaad nahin tha

 yahi nahin is stadium main cricket kii jo pich thi wo desh kii nambar ek pichon main se ek thi
 But today these players are very desperate to see the plight of their pitch, because they could not save it even if they wanted to
 coach ishtiya ahamed bataate hai, 'ye pich neshnal level kii thi or yahaan par board ke kai match ho chuke hai
 The pitch curators had come before the match and the pitch that they saw here, they have been the pitch curators of BCCI, they said that Uttar Pradesh had the best pitch and it was a very good ground
 lekin aaj dekh sakate hai ki kya haal gaya ho gaya he

 IANS se input Gandhian Anna Hazare on Wednesday expressed deep displeasure at Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi for not meeting the sarpanch from his village and said that he considers the decision not to meet the Congress leader in future to be true
 hajaare ke gaanv se gaye sarpanch se rahul ke na milane ko lekar khaasaa vivaad uth gaya he
 Hazare, who is fasting these days, has said in a written statement that the sarpanch and his team have taken this decision for self-respect
 unhone haalanki yah bhi kaha ki unke man main kisi ke khilaaf koi vyaktigat bhaavana nahin he
 Sarpanch Jai Singh Rao Mapari of Ralegan Siddhi village, Hazare's personal secretary Suresh Pathare and Ramdas Ugale came to New Delhi on Tuesday to meet Rahul Gandhi
 lekin unki mulaakaat nahin hui kyonki bataaya jaataa he ki unhone rahul se mulaakaat kaa samay nahin liya tha
 Anna Hazare, who is running the movement against corruption, said that his colleagues and sarpanch told him that now they will not meet Rahul
 hajaare ne bayaan main kaha ab agar rahul se mulaakaat kaa samay diya bhi gaya to bhi sarpanch unase nahin milenge
 Unhappy due to lack of time to meet Rahul, the party decided to go back from Delhi yesterday and said that even now that they have got an appointment, the village itself will decide whether to meet the Congress leader or not
 congress ke piti thomas ne haalanki is samvadaheenata ke liye maafee maangi jiske chalate bhram kii sthiti utpann hui

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not just hit the hands of US President Donald Trump, has hit a big diplomatic ground in a way
 modi-trump mulaakaat ke baad tamaam news channelon par jitani charchaa madhyasthata kii baat ko thukraae jane kii ho rahi thi, usase kahin zyada charchaa haath par haath maarane ke video kii hoti rahi
 There is no doubt that when a diplomatic dialogue takes place, mutual behavior and gesture have their own importance
 raashtrapati trump ne pradhanmantri modi kii angrezi ko shandaar bataaya, to us maukey kaa apni tarah se istemaal karte hue pradhanmantri modi ne unke haath ko takat lagaakar apni ore khinchaa or phir us par ek zordaar thapki rakh di
 Through this, he showed the kind of personal chemistry he carries, and how he used his opportunity to show his dominance
 ab aate hai un baton par, jo pradhanmantri modi ne raashtrapati trump ke saamne kahin
 He clearly stated that all the issues between India and Pakistan are bilateral and India does not bother any third country on this
 zaahir-si baat he ki ksht jaise shishtachar se jude shabd kaa istemaal kar pradhanmantri modi ne damdaar tareeke se yaa kahen ki kootnithik tareeke se apni baat rakh di or trump bhi yah kehete hue madhyasthata kii baat se haath khinchne ko majaboor ho gaye ki donon hi deshon ke pradhanmantri (bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantri) unke mitra hai, achche mitra hai, or donon aapas main vichaar-vimarsh ke zariye muddon ko sulajhaayenge
 That is, Trump was forced to eat the same words he had said before the meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on 22 July, and even claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself had spoken to mediate with him
 
 uske baad bharat kii kadi pratikriya ai, or videshmantri es
 Jaishankar had given a statement in Parliament that no such proposal was made by Prime Minister Modi
 yah jhooth he, lekin uske baavjood raashtrapati trump ne 22 agast ko phir madhyasthata shabd kaa istemaal kiya or kaha ki vah jaananaa chahenge ki bharat ke paas tanaav ko ghataane or kashmir main sthiti ko saamaanya karne kaa kya rodmap he
 The United States believes that the removal of Article 370 is an internal matter of India and many statements of American officials have been made in this regard, but America's concern is that the atmosphere created after the removal of Article 370, Tensions between India and Pakistan have increased, and there is a risk of disturbance in the area, which needs to be reduced, so President Trump repeatedly stressed that India and Pakistan should work towards reducing tension through mutual dialogue
 is maukey par pradhanmantri modi ne imran khan ke saath phone par hui us baatcheet kaa bhi zikr kiya, jo imran khan ke pradhanmantri banane ke vakt hui thi, or kaha ki kis tarah unhone imran khan se kaha tha ki donon deshon ko milakar garibi se ladanaa he, beemaari se ladanaa he, berojgaare se ladanaa he, or inhen baton ke saath pradhanmantri ne apni baat puri kar di
 It is a declared truth that it has been India's policy that terrorism and negotiation cannot go hand in hand and hence whenever Pakistan talks, the condition on the part of India is that it should first act with solid decisiveness and evidence against terrorism
 Take action aisi karrwai, jise jamini str par veriphai kiya ja sake, or uske baad hi baatcheet hogi
 If Trump and Modi were sitting in front of the camera, then Prime Minister Modi did not mention this on this occasion
 iske peeche do vajahen ho sakati hai
 One, India does not want it to be completely aerogent in terms of talking to Pakistan, especially when the US itself is advocating it
 duusari vajah, sari baat us vakt saaf-saaf na bolkar jab trump or pradhanmantri modi kii aapasi baatcheet hogi, to yah baat saaf kar di hogi
 Diplomacy dictates that many times your voice may not be said out loud, but stay firmly on your condition
 pakistan jis tarah anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke baad kashmir ke mudde kaa antarrashtriyakaran karne main juta hua he, aise main bharat use zyada mauka nahin dena chahta, or isamen use america ke saath kii bhi zarurat he
 The United Nations Federation is going to meet in New York next month and Pakistan is trying to take the issue of Kashmir to all extent
 modi-trump mulaakaat ke baad pakistan ko laga ki uske haath kuch nahin laga he, lihaaza uske turant baad pradhanmantri imran khan ne bayaan jari kar atomi hathiyaar kii dhamkee tak de daali, jo pakistan kii baukhalaahat dikhaata he or duniya main use na mil rahe samarthan ko bhi
 It is obvious that India's diplomats have played very cleanly and efficiently so that even the snake dies and the sticks do not break
 ek sambhaavna is baat kii ho sakati he ki back channel diplomasi ke zariye pakistan se tanaav ghataane kii koshish ho, lekin ab sara daaromadar pakistan par he ki aakhirkaar vah kashmir kaa raag alaapna band karata he yaa nahin or aatankwaad ke khilaaf thos karrwai karata he yaa nahin
 President Trump, of course, tried it on his behalf, but because of this India would not be willing to talk to Pakistan, instead it would need concrete results against terrorism on the ground
 vaise, trump ne madhyasthata kaa card khilne kii jo koshish kii, uske peeche kaa makasad saaf he ki america pakistan ko bhi khush rakhana chahta he, kyonki afghanistan main use uski bahut zarurat he or jis tarah trump afghanistan se apane sainikon ko hataane ko betaab ho rahe hai, aise main pakistan ko na khush karnaa unke liye ulta sabit ho saktaa he, to jab imran khan mili, to unase unke jaisi baat kar lee or phir pradhanmantri modi ke saamne apni hi baat se mukar gaye
 So Pakistan is feeling cheated by itself, but it does not have the courage to go against the US either

 71 years after the independence of the country, there is a dispute related to the national flag which does not take the name of freezing
 har saal rashtriya diwason par ye vivaad saamne aa jaataa he
 This dispute is- 'who designed the national flag
 ’ vikipedia par dhundhenge to is saal kaa jawaab milegaa- ‘pingali venkaiya’
 But like many historians, many Internet users do not blindly believe this answer
 twitor or soshal media ke anya plateforms par ek sandesh failaayaa ja rahaa he ki ‘bhartiya rashtriya dhvaj ko hyderabad kii muslim mahila shrimati suraiya badaruddin taiyabaji ne dizin kiya tha
 The India Today Fact Check team tried to find out the truth of the claims and counter-claims by designing historical flag after digging into historical facts
 rashtriya dhvaj kii utpatti1921 main mahatma gandhi ne bhartiya rashtriya congress kii baithak main rashtriya dhvaj kii aavashyaktaa jataai thi
 It was initially designed by Pingali Venkaiah of Andhra Pradesh, who was himself associated with the Congress
 gandhi chaahate the ki venkaiya dhvaj ke bich charakhe ko bhi shaamil karen
 Gandhi's desire was that the flag should include three colors in which red would represent Hindus, green Muslims and white people of other religions
 1931 main congress kii dhvaj samiti ne tirange main kuch badlaav kiye
 Saffron was replaced by red and the order of colors was also changed, as we now see in the tricolor
 (jaankaree kaa strot- 26 / 9 / 2004 ko da hindu main prakashit ramchandra guha kaa lekh- "truths About The Tricolour”)22 july 1947 ko samvidhan sabha ne rashtriya dhvaj ko lekar prastaav paarit kiya
 In this, Jawaharlal Nehru proposed to convert the charkha in the national flag with the Ashoka Chakra
 yahaan dekhen prastaav
 
 
 What is the dispute? Neither Pingali Venkaiah's name nor Suraiya Tyabji was mentioned in the Constituent Assembly resolution as the designer of the national flag
 haal main ‘da vir’ main prakashit lekh- “how the Tricolour and Lion Emblem Really Came to Be” main suraiya taiyabaji kii beti laila taiyabaji ne bataaya he ki kis tarah unke pita badaruddin taiyabaji ne nehru ke nirdesh par dow rajendra prasad kii adhyakshata main dhvaj samiti kaa gathan kiya tha
 Badruddin ICS officer Tyabji was working in the Prime Minister's Office
 laila taiyabaji ne ye bhi bataaya ki kis tarah unke mata-pita ne ashok chrak kaa vichaar diya or unki maa ne dhvaj kaa graphic khaakaa taiyaar kiya
 According to the words of Laila Tyabji in the article - My father saw the flag for the first time - it was stitched under the supervision of my mother by Edde Tailors & Drapers located in Connaught Place, Delhi
 india today fact check team ne is sambandh main laila taiyabaji se baat karne kii koshish kii to unhone is sandarbh main vinamrata se or kuch kehane se inkaar kar diya
 Who was Suraiya Tyabji? Suraiya Tyabji was a famous artist
 wo hyderabad ke ek prasiddh muslim parivaar se taalluk rakhti thim lekin apane gaiyr paaramparik aadhunik drushtikon ke liye jaani jaati thim
 Her husband ICS officer Badruddin Tyabji later also worked as a diplomat abroad
 badaruddin taiyabaji ke dada kaa naam bhi badaruddin taiyabaji tha or wo prasiddh vakil hone ke saath congress ke sadsy the
 What do historians say? Did Suraiya Tyabji really design the national flag? According to Flag Foundation of India, an NGO formed by Congress leader Naveen Jindal, it was the design of Suraiya Badruddin Tyabji which was approved by the Constituent Assembly for the national flag
 naveen jindal ne supreme court main nagarikon ko rashtriya dhvaj fahraane kaa adhikaar milane ko lekar kanoonee ladaai jeetne ke badflag foundation of indiyaka gathan kiya tha
 We spoke to A
 Pandurang Reddy, a historian from Hyderabad about this subject
 unhone hi rashtriya dhvaj ke diziner ke taur par pingali venkaiya kaa naam khaarij kar suraiya taiyabaji ke naam ko aage kiya tha
 Reddy cites the British author Trevor Royal's book "the last days of the Raj" in this context - "one of the contrasts with Indian history is that the national flag was designed by Badruddin Tyabji
" 
 
 nehru kii car par us raat jo dhvaj fahraa rahaa tha use taiyabaji kii patni ne khaas taur par dizin kiya tha
 "because Reddy could not confirm his claims with historical documents, we spoke to another famous historian, Syed Irfan Habib
 professor habib ne saaf taur par kaha, “ye vivaadit vishay he jo ki abhi tak nahin sulajhaa
 Because concrete historical documents do not exist in this regard, the claims and counterclaims keep coming up
 
 
 itihaaskaar is sambandh main zyada kuch nahin kah sakate
 But neither can we refute the claims of Pingali Vankeya's family nor what came out of the "investigation" of Suraiya Tyabji? It came out from the parliamentary records that Suraiya Tyabji's name was actually included among the members of the flag presentation committee, 14 The national flag was presented in August 1947
 lekin isadastavejase bhi is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin mila ki suraiya taiyabaji ne rashtriya dhvaj ko dizin kiya tha yaa nahin
 But the message being spread on social media platforms has all kinds of misinformation from spelings to genealogy
 suraiya taiyabaji naa to isies adhikari thim or naa hi unke pati badaruddin taiyabaji bombai hoicourt ke pehle chif justise the
