 ab aap dekhen ki is style main aapaki ore se or kitni creativity aa sakati he! Former cricket captain Kapil Dev has always been impeccable and if he has to compare captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and current Test captain Virat Kohli, he does not hesitate to give his opinion
 NDTV se khaas baatcheet ke dauraan 1983 world cap ke vijeta captain kapil dev ne kaha, 'viraat kohli aakraamak ravaiya rakhte hai
 When we look back to the 80s, there was no aggression in that team
 lekin ab team ekadam aakraamak nazar aati he
 MS Dhoni dominated for 7-8 years
 lekin wo ek alag paraformar the
 While Virat is the aggressor
 ' Kapil believes that the aggression in the team today is the need of the hour, hence it is justified
 wo kehete hai, 'aaj team india ko dekhtaa hum to hairaan ho jaataa hum or kahata hum kyon nahin? team ko aisa hi rukh rakhana chahie
 Comments kapil kehete hai ki viraat ko apni jagah banani chahie
 Every cricketer has a different personality
 koi cricketer duusare jaisaa nahin ban saktaa
 Virat has done extremely well as a captain, which Dhoni has done long ago
 maujuuda bharat-newzealand series ko lekar bhi kapil dev ne team india ko saavdhaan rahane kii salaah di he
 Kapil Dev says, "in today's era, any team can beat any team
 newzealand team ke liye bharat aakar in halaat main jeetna aasaan nahin hoga
 Now international cricketers know more about the situation in all countries
 kyonki wo vahaan jaakar khel pate hai
 The Kiwi team can take advantage of this
 ' During a special conversation with NDTV, 1983 World Cup winner captain Kapil Dev said, 'virat Kohli has an aggressive attitude
 jab ham 80 ke dashak kii ore dekhte hai tab us team main akramakata nahin hoti thi
 But now the team looks very aggressive
 emes dhoni ne 7-8 saal tak dabadabaa banaaye rakhaa
 But he was a different performer
 jabaki viraat akramak hai
 ' kapil maanate hai ki aaj team main jo akramakata he wo samay kii maang he, isliye jaays he
 He says, 'today when i see Team India, i get shocked and say why not? The team should take such a stand
 'tippaniyan Kapil says that Virat should make his place
 har cricketer kii apni ek alag shaksiyat hoti he
 No cricketer can be like another
 viraat ne bataur captain behad acha pradarshan kiya he jo dhoni bahut pehle kar chuke hai
 Kapil Dev has also advised Team India to be careful about the current india-new Zealand series
 kapil dev kehete hai, 'aaj ke daur main koi bhi team kisi bhi team ko haraa sakati he
 It will not be easy for the New Zealand team to come to India and win under these conditions
 ab antarrashtriya cricketron ko sabhi deshon ke halaat ke bare main zyaada maaloom hota he

 Just like any Greek tragedy, every new drama written to improve relations between India and Pakistan ends tragically or tragically
 drishy main ek nae nayak imran khan kaa pravesh bhi hua, par kahani jas kii tas hi rahi
 Imran Khan, who entered politics after reaching the post of Prime Minister of Pakistan, kept saying during the entire election campaign that his image in India has been made the villain of Bollywood
 khan duragrahi najar aate the
 However, many Indian analysts believed that Imran was in fact the root of all the problems and the biggest villain of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa
 pakistan kii sena samarthit khan ne awam ko "nayaa pakistan'' kaa sapana dikhaaya
 In this, he talked about freeing the country from corruption and bringing the economy standing on the verge of bankruptcy
 satta main aane ke baad khan ne yah sanket bhi diya ki ve bharat ke saath ek nai pari shuru karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 Within a month of assuming the throne, he wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he went ahead to resolve all important issues including Kashmir (pakistan's main concern), terrorism (india's biggest concern) and trade relations between the two countries
 Wanted to try
 unhone suzav diya ki donon deshon ke videsh mantriyon ko neuyork main hone vaali sanyukt raashtra mahasabha kii baithak ke dauraan, alag milakar "aage badaae kii sambhaavnaaon'' par vichaar karnaa chahie
 India very carefully accepted his proposal but within a day changed its stance, saying that the talks are postponed due to the current "worrying and traumatic events"
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa ne bharat ke surakshakarmiyon kii pakistani sainikon dwaara "krur hatyaon'' or pakistan main haal main jari 20 dak tikat jisamen bharat par hamale karne vaale aatankwaadiyon kaa mahimamandan kiya gaya he, kaa hawala dete hue baithak ke radd hone kii ghoshnaa kii
 He went so far as to introduce unusual strict tone and said that the evil agenda of Shapakistan has now come out in the open and the world has also seen the real face of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan
 '' is par khan modi par hamalavar ho gaye or talkh twit likhaa, "puri jindagi maine chote logon ko bade ohadon par kabiz hote dekha he jinke paas doordarshita or bade nazariye kii kami hi rahati he
 The Indian statement had many meanings
 aatankiyon vaale dak tikat july main jari kiye gaye the tab khan satta main nahin the or agar bharat ko yah baat ab pataa chali he to yah badi khufia vifaltaa he
 The incident of the BSF jawan slitting his ruthless murder and his body being found on the international border had happened a day before the acceptance of the negotiation proposal
 jammu-kashmir polisbal ke teen javaanon kii hatya kii ghatana nai he lekin haal ke dinon main ghati main lagaataar aisi kai ghatnaayen hui hai
 Then why the Indian government showed such a strict attitude, it remains a puzzle
 bhartiya sutron kaa daawa he ki khufia agenciyon ke paas thos saboot the ki pakistan samarthit aatanki sanghathanon ne aagaamee panchayat chunaavon ko baadhit karne ke liye ghati main teen pulicekarmiyon kii hatya kii thi
 They believe that Khan was merely pretending to improve the image at the international level so that the international pressure that the Pakistani military has made to make honest efforts against terrorism can be reduced
 agar bharat kaa aisa hi akalan tha to phir use baatcheet ke liye raji hi nahin hona chahie tha
 The result of this recent tu-tu, main-i is that India and Pakistan have now put themselves in a position of more tension than before
 modi sarkaar ko aatmanirikshan karnaa chahie ki kyon sakchat ravaiye kaa baavjood kashmir main halaat sanbhalane kaa naam nahin le rahe hai
 And why has it so far failed to effectively curb Pakistan's nefarious designs in the valley
 javabdehi pakistan kii bhi banati he, khaastaur se sena pramukh kii
 If Bajwa says that he wants peace between the two countries, like Khan, he should at least ensure that his army does not violate the ceasefire agreement on the loc and cease efforts to send infiltrators to Kashmir
 Will do
 nai shuruyaat ke liye hameshaa aashaa or gunjaaish bani rahati he, lekin koshish yah bhi honi chahie ki us shuruyaat kaa bhi hameshaa kii tarah dukhad ant na ho
 If India feels that Imran Khan's efforts were merely pretense to ease international pressure, then he should not have agreed to the talks earlier

 ’ Senior Congress leader and Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has expressed his opinion in favor of the Election Commission on the issue of alleged disturbances in evms
 haalanki unki party congress iviem kii gadabadi kaa mudda uthaati rahi he
 Punjab is the only state where the Congress formed a government under the leadership of Captain after the elections in the recently held assembly
 amarinder ne kaha ki agar iviem main gadabadi hui hoti to main mukhyamantri nahin hota
 The Akali Dal would have been in power
 gauratlab he ki congress ne punjab main 117 vidhansabha siton main se 77 par jeet hasil kii thi or lambey samay se sattashin akali dal ko bedakhal kar diya tha
 But today the Congress along with other opposition parties complained about the EVM disturbances in the Election Commission
 partiyon kaa aarope he ki mashin main gadabadi ke chalate bijepi ko uttar pradesh main baari bahumat mila he
 However, former law minister Veerappa Moily said that he supports the technology
 unhone kaha ki ab ballat paper se chunaav karwaane kaa koi sawaal hi nahin uthta
 This is not a progressive step
 mujhe nahin lagata ki hamen phir se puraane taur-tareeke apnaane chahie
 The comments moili ne enditivi se kaha, "ham apane system ko sensor kar rahe hai
 EVM was introduced when we were in power and the machines were thoroughly tested
 " party ke do varisht netaaon ke bayaan se congress baikfoot par aa gai he
 At the same time, Congress Party leader Gulab Nabi Azad, Aam Aadmi Party's National Convenor Arvind Kejriwal and BSP Mayawati have demanded the withdrawal of evms from the Election Commission and conduct elections from the ballot
 udhar, iviem ke saath chhedchhad ke raajnneetik hamalon ke bich ek baar phir chunaav ayog ne daawa kiya he ki is prakaar ke aarope bebuniyaad hai or saaf kaha he ki iviem ke saath koi tempring sambhav nahin he
 The Commission has come out in support of evms
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal dwaara electronic voting mashin (iviem) par baar-baar sawaal uthaae jane ke baad chunaav ayog may ke pehle hafte main EVM se chhedchhad sabit karne kii chunauti degaa
 This challenge will be open for 10 days
 is dauraan iviem main teen se chaar str tak tempring karne kii khuli chunauti hogi
 Not only this, the Election Commission can also challenge to tamper with the EVM machine by opening it
 chunaav ayog kaa kahana he ki 2009 main bhi iviem kii swaamitvta par sawaal uthaae jane ke baad hamane khulaa chalange diya tha lekin koi ise pruv nahin kar sakaa
 Significantly, the Congress had won 77 out of 117 assembly seats in Punjab and sacked the long-standing Akali Dal
 lekin aaj congress ne anya vipakshi dalon ke saath chunaav ayog main iviem main gadabadi kii shikaayat kii
 The parties allege that the BJP got an overwhelming majority in Uttar Pradesh due to machine malfunctions
 haalanki purv kanoon mantri virappa moili ne kaha ki vah takneekee kaa samarthan karte hai
 He said that now there is no question of holding elections with ballot paper

 "pienech'' ab siyaasi yaadon main dhundhale pad gaye hai, par unka bemisaal kariyar sarkaar or zyaadaatar khud indira gandhi ke saath asaadhaaran najdiki or asar se vabsta rahaa tha

 When his stars were at a height, Haksar left a unique and indelible mark on this country and this land
 unhen 1969 main hue bainkon ke rashtriyakaran or uskaa virodh karne vaale vitt mantri morarji desai ko darkinar karne ke mukhya ranneetikaron main ek mana jaataa he
 He was both a witness and a strategist of the Battle of Bangladesh and played a particularly important role in the 1972 Simla Agreement with Pakistan
 1968 main ro ke gathan se lekar 1974 main pokaran ke parmaanu pareekshanon tak yaa 1975 main sikkim ke vilay tak us vakt ke sarkaar ke zyaadaatar ahm faislon me haksar kaa gupachup magar taqatvar haath rahaa tha, jo apane sarparast ko yaa to rasta dikhaa rahaa hota yaa roak rahaa hota tha
 It was a career that stood on the fragile foundations of a relationship and that relationship was her friendship with Indira Gandhi and her ideological similarities
 phir yah hona hi tha ki yah rishta nijee or siyaasi takaraavon, yaa sidhe-sade lafjon main sanjay gandhi or immergency, ke boj se charmara jaataa
 Yet a stubborn spirit of loyalty remained even during this estrangement
 dosti se lekar mohabhang tak: do jindagiyon or kai chitthiyon kii kahani
 In May 1965, some part-cushers took charge of the Deputy High Commissioner of India in Britain
 ve das saal baad apane behad jane-pahachaane basere main laute the
 He had to sail the boat of indo-british relations in a particularly bad phase when Prime Minister Harold Wilson came out in support of Pakistan in the indo-pak war of 1965
 magar zyada ahm shaayad yah tha ki unka yah kaarykaal indira gandhi or unki jindagiyon main or adhik ghanishtataa le aayaa
 The seed of friendship between them in London in the 1930s was now blooming brilliantly
 indira gandhi ke donon bete, rajeev or sanjay, england main the
 Rajiv initially attended Trinity College, Cambridge University, but later moved to Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London
 sanjay landan ke paas kru sthit rolls royas factory main chaar saal kii aprentisship kar rahe the
 On 10 November 1965, Indira Gandhi wrote the first letter to the PNH, at least the first, which is present in the old papers of Haksar
 us vakt ve soochna-prasaaran mantri thim or unki mukhya chintaaon main pita kii viraasat kii hifaazat or beton kii padhai-likhaai shaamil tha, jinamein ek 21 or doosraa 19 saal kaa tha
 Friend and trustworthy Babuji, you may know that my younger son Sanjay is working in the Rolls Royce factory of the crew
 abhi tak vah vahaan khush rahaa he or kru ke logon kii report bhi acchhee hai
 About a week ago he wrote that he has learned everything he had to learn in the factory and now the question is to repeat and pursue those same things
 use nahin lagata ki ve use kuch bhi nayaa sikhayenge
 So Sanjay is thinking not to complete the course but to leave it at or near the end of the year and perhaps return to India to set up his own work
 yah main behad bharose or raajadari ke saath likh rahi hum kyonki sanjay nahin chahta ki main kisi se bhi iskaa zikr karun
 i have written to Sanjay and told that i am writing to you
 yah bhi ki use aapke paas janaa or aapse milanaa chahie
 He is reluctant to meet new people, but Rajiv may bring him there
 vah rajeev se alahada kism kaa he—kuch maamalon main zyada vyaavhaarik or duusare maamalon main zyada sankochi or juda
 Leaving the factory at this time would mean that he would not have a degree, except that he had practical experience
 mujhe nijee taur par lagata he ki isse bharat main mushkil ho sakati he, khaskar isliye ki shuruyaat main uskaa apana kaam jamaane ke liye bahut zyada puunji jutanaa mumkin na ho
 i do not know how much you have to deal with these matters, but if you can find a way out without involving Sanjay, i would be very grateful
 ek vajah yah ho sakati he ki bahut dur kru main vah kataa hua or akelaa mahasoos karata he
 If so, is there a course in London, where it would be easier for friends to keep an eye on him? With good luck and haste, Indira replied on February 21, 1966, Haksar
 
 
 21 farvari, 1966 ko
 He wrote: My dear Induji
 
 
 kripaya ladakon ke bare main phikr na karen
 i know how useful it is to teach
 unke saath meraa kisi bhi kism kaa koi rishta na hona meri mukhya pareshaani he
 Now i have established a personal relationship with Rajiv
 ab vah aata he or jamaane bhar kii baaten karata he
 But i have not even started with Sanjay
 urmila or main jaldi hi uske paas jane kaa man bana rahe hai
 i have also written to him
 main use ehsaas dilaanaa chaahunga ki ek shaks ke taur par ham use chaahate hai or mahaj isliye nahin ki uske maa-baap se hamaari dosti he
 i believe that he should complete his course
 mujhe beshak yah nahin pataa ki vah kru kyon or kaise gaya? kya yah uski apni pasand thi? kya uski sachmuch dilchaspee thi?rajeev acha ladkaa he
 However, he is still in a panic and does not know exactly what he would like to do
 vah kalatmak rujhaan vaala maaloom detaa he
 He expresses his mind on color, design and shape-type
 vah easter kii chhuttiyon main ghar jane ke bare main soch rahaa he
 i think he must have written to you about it
 
 
 baad kii ghatnaon se pataa chalaa, haksar ne vaaki sanjay gandhi ke saath baatcheet ke taar jode or saaf-saaf lafjon main bataa diya ki use rolls royas kaa course puraa karnaa hi chahie or do saal khatm hone par chhodia nahin chahie, jabaki us noujvaan ne aisa karne kaa pakkaa iraadaa bana liya tha
 Irritated by the advice of his mother's friend was to be born and this was the first negative thing in Sanjay Gandhi against Haksar
 jaldi hi or bhi zyada nakaaratmak baaten ikattha hone vaali thim
 In February 1967, as India was moving towards elections, Indira Gandhi resumed her letters with Haksar
 farvari 1967 ke bilkul shuruaati dinon main, shaayad 4 yaa 5 taarikh ko, apane chunaav abhiyaan ke ain bichobich indira gandhi ne unhen ek moti peshkash karte hue chitthee likhi:
 
 
 i am writing to you in a hurry while visiting Rae Bareli
 main kaaphi dinon se aapako likhnaa chaahati rahi hum taaki aapaki chitthee ke liye shukriya adaa kar sakuun or saath hi aapse puch sakuun ki kya aap dilli aana chahenge
 This last thing is undoubtedly premature

 Symonds said, 'I don't think anyone can break Sachin's record
 philhal ponting, bouchar or kallis kaaphi test cricket khel rahe hai
 These three can only go close to that, but i don't think any player starting a career will play 160-170 Test

 i am happy with my decision
 mujhe austrailian team kii kami nahin khalati
 Symonds and Andrew Flintoff of England are currently freelance cricketers, but this Australian believes that most of the cricketers will follow this trend in the coming times
 unhone kaha, ‘bhavishya main aisa ho saktaa he lekin yah test cricket khilne kii ichha par nirbhar karegaa
 Symonds believes that T20 cricket has revolutionized the game and that administrators must balance the three formats of the game to save Test cricket
 unhone kaha, ‘jab maine antarrashtriya cricket khelnaa shuru kiya to kabhi tii-20 cricket ke bare main sochaa bhi nahin tha lekin is praaroop ne khel main kranti laa di he
 This has increased the scope of cricket

 bijendra singh ne bataaya ki notebandi ke faisle ke baad unhone kai baar bank se cash nikaalane kii koshish kii lekin kamyaabi hasil nahin hui
 The same situation was with the bride side

 ' bataaya jaataa he ki amit shah ne bhi kaaryakartaaon se china kii communist party se aage nikalne kaa lakshya rakhane ko kaha he

 The first is that any person can become a member by visiting the party's website
 doosraa party dwaara jari kiye gaye ek mobile number par esemes bhejkar bhi sadsyta lee ja sakati he

 jis sasti pyaaj kii kharid or bikri main dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar par dhaandhlee ke aarope lag rahe hai, us pyaaj kii skim kii abhi sthiti kya he? ye jaanane ke liye ham dilli kii un 280 rashan kii dukaanon kii taraf badhen jahaan par ye pyaaj bik rahi he
 First i reached a ration shop of Majnu Ka Tila of Chandni Chowk Assembly constituency
 dukaan ke baahar naa to saste pyaaj kaa binar tha or naa hi dukaan ke andar jhaankne par pyaaj kii koi jhalak mil rahi thi
 Shopkeeper Babu Ram Gupta told that after September 12, no onion came to his shop
 aasapaas maujuud logon ne bataaya kii pichley baar kareeb 10 din pehle unhone is dukaan se 30 rupee kilo pyaaj kharidi thi, lekin uske baad se abhi sasti pyaaj kaa intazaar hi he
 Manoj Kumar, who planted vegetables in front of the ration shop, said that he is selling onions for Rs 60 a kg
 manoj ne bataaya ki jab is rashan ke dukaan par pyaaj aata tha to us vaqt wo keval 30 rupee kilo vaale pyaaj ko ek darshak kii tarah khadey dekhte the kyonki jab 30 main milegaa to 60 rupee vaale ko koun poochhega? Now after that i reached a ration shop in Bishwambhar Das Marg, New Delhi
 dukaan ke baahar 30 rupee kilo pyaaj kii skim kaa binar to laga tha lekin vahaan maujuud dukandaar ramesh kumaar ne bataaya ki unke yahaan pyaaj lagbhag ek hafte se nahin aayaa
 Now after this, i reached a ration shop in Hari Nagar Ashram falling in Jangpura assembly constituency
 pichhali baar bhi jab main dilli sarkaar ke saste pyaaj kii is skim par story kar rahaa tha, tab keval isi rashan kii dukaan pyaaj mila tha
 The comments dukaan par pahunchaa to pataa chalaa ki is baar to yahaan bhi do hafte se pyaaj kaa koi ata pataa hi nahin he
 Shopkeeper Pawan said that since September 12, no onion had come here from the government
 pawan ne bataaya ki wo jab khaadya aapurti vibhaag main phone karte hai, to kaha jaataa he ki godaam main pyaaj nahin he isliye nahin aa rahi he
 Overall, it is a matter of cheap onion scheme that the Delhi government is getting so upset that the people of Delhi are not getting this cheap onion
 sabase pehle main chandani chowk vidhansabha kshetra ke majanu kaa tila kii ek rashan kii dukaan par pahunchaa
 There was neither cheap onion banner outside the shop nor was there any glimpse of onion when peeping inside the shop
 dukandaar babu ram gupta ne bataaya ki 12 sitambar ke baad unki dukaan par koi pyaaj nahin aayaa
 People present told that last time about 10 days ago, they had bought 30 kg kg of onion from this shop, but since then there is still waiting for cheap onion
 rashan kii dukaan ke thik saamne sabzi kaa thela lagaae manoj kumaar ne bataaya ki wo pyaaj 60 rupee kilo bech rahe hai
 Manoj told that when onions used to come to this ration shop, at that time he used to see only 30 rupees onion standing as a spectator because when he gets 30, then who will ask 60 rupees? ab iske baad main nai dilli ke bishwambhar das maarg kii ek rashan kii dukaan par panhucha
 The banner of the Rs 30 kg onion scheme was put outside the shop, but shopkeeper Ramesh Kumar, who was present there, said that onion had not come to him for almost a week
 ab iske baad main jangpura vidhansabha kshetra main padane vaale hari nagar ashram kii ek rashan ke dukaan main pahunchaa
 Last time also when i was doing a story on this scheme of cheap onion of Delhi government, only this ration shop got onion
 tippaniyan When reached at the shop, it came to know that this time there is no sign of onion here for two weeks
 dukandaar pawan ne bataaya ki 12 sitambar ke baad se yahaan koi pyaaj sarkaar kii taraf se nahin aayaa
 Pawan told that when he calls in the food supply department, it is said that there is no onion in the warehouse, hence it is not coming
 kul milakar baat ye he ki dilli sarkaar jis saste pyaaj ke skim par dilli sarkaar kii itani fazihat ho rahi he ki wo sasti pyaaj dilli ke logon ko mil hi nahin rahi he

 Governments in the state and the center changed over the last three and a half decades, but the fate of the victims did not change

 When the great allrounder Kapil Dev (kapil Dev) came on the field, lightning flashed in the audience
 kapil chaahe gendbaaji kar rahe hon yaa ballebaaji, darshakon ke bich aakarshan kaa centre hote the
 It will be a privilege of world cricket that the four best all-rounders - England's Ian Botham, Pakistan's Imran Khan, New Zealand's Richard Hadlee and India's Kapil Dev - played cricket in the same round and the result of the match was reversed by their unilateral performances several times
 kept
 saurav ganguli se bahut pehle, captain ke taur par kapil dev ko bhartiya team main aakraamak ravaiya laane kaa shrey jaataa he
 Born on 6 January 1959, Kapil did not miss a bold decision when he had the chance
 yah alag baat he ki us samay kii bhartiya team gendbaaji ke lihaaj se kamjor thi or unke yah faisle zyaadaatar maukon par team ke liye faldaayi sabit nahin ho pate the
 Thanks to this same adventure, Kapil surprised everyone by making Team India the champion in World Cup 1983
 is worldcup main kapil ne zimbabwe ke khilaaf visham paristhitiyon main 175* ran kii pari bhi kheli thi
 The comments bharat kii ore se international cricket main ab tak keval chaar gendbaaj hi hetric (teen gend par teen wicket) darj kar paae hai or kapil unamem se ek hai
 Kapil did this feat in the ODI against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata in 1991
 kapil se pehle unke hi rajya haryana ke chetan sharma ne vanade main hetric darj kii thi
 Apart from these two bowlers, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan have taken hat-trick in Test cricket
 kapil kii yah hetric teen anya bhartiya gendbaajon (test or vanade) ke mukaable is myne main alag rahi ki unhone do over main yah 'tikdi' puri kii thi
 In January 1991, in the final of the Asia Cup against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, Kapil Dev caught Sri Lanka's Roshan Mahanama with wicketkeeper Kiran More on the last ball of his one over
 iske baad agle over kii pehali do gendo par rumesh ratnayake or sanath jayasoorya ke wicket jatke
 This hat-trick was recorded on three consecutive balls of two overs in such a manner that even the spectators on the field and watching the cricket fans could not realize it for a long time
 kapil ke alaava teen anya bhartiya gendbaajon chetan sharma (vanade) or harbhajan singh va irfan pathan (test) ne apni hetric ek hi over kii lagaataar teen gendon par banaai thi
 Chetan Sharma registered his hat-trick against New Zealand in Nagpur in Reliance World Cup-1987
 isi tarah test main harbhajan ne australia ke khilaaf varsh 2001 main kolkata main or irfan pathan ne pakistan ke khilaaf varsh 2006 main karachi main hetric lee thi
 Long before Sourav Ganguly, Kapil Dev as the captain is credited with bringing an aggressive attitude to the Indian team
 6 janvari 1959 ko janme kapil mauka padane par saahasik faisle lene se nahin chookte the
 It is another matter that the Indian team at that time was weak in terms of bowling and their decisions did not prove to be fruitful for the team on most occasions
 apni isi saahasik captaini kii badaulat kapil ne worldcup 1983 main team india ko champion banaakar har kisi ko chaunkaaya tha
 In this World Cup, Kapil scored 175 * runs against Zimbabwe under odd conditions
 tippaniyan From the Indian side, only four bowlers have been able to register a hat-trick (three wickets off three balls) in international cricket and Kapil is one of them
 kapil ne varsh 1991 main kolkata ke eden gardens main srilanka ke khilaaf vanade main yah karnama kiya tha
 Before Kapil, Chetan Sharma of his own state Haryana registered a hat-trick in odis
 in donon boleron ke alaava test cricket main harbhajan singh va irfan pathan hetric le chuke hai
 This hat-trick of Kapil was different from the three other Indian bowlers (test and ODI) in the sense that he completed this 'trio' in two overs
 janvari 1991 ko kolkata ke eden gardens main srilanka ke khilaaf asia cap ke final main kapildev ne apane ek over kii aakhri gend par srilanka ke roshan mahanama ko wicketiper kiran more se kaich karaayaa
 After this, Ramesh Ratnayake and Sanath Jayasuriya took wickets on the first two balls of the next over
 do overon kii lagaataar teen gendon par yah hetric is andaaj main darj hui thi ki maidan par maujuud darshak or tivi dekh rahe cricketpremiyon ko bhi kaaphi der tak iskaa ahsaas nahin ho paaya tha
 Apart from Kapil, three other Indian bowlers Chetan Sharma (ODI) and Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan (test) scored their hat-trick from three consecutive balls of the same over
 chetan sharma ne apni hetric newjiland ke khilaaf reliance worldcup-1987 main nagpur main darj kii thi
 Similarly, in the test, Harbhajan took a hat-trick against Australia in Kolkata in 2001 and Irfan Pathan against Pakistan in Karachi in 2006
 bharat kii ore se international cricket main ab tak keval chaar gendbaaj hi hetric (teen gend par teen wicket) darj kar paae hai or kapil unamem se ek hai
 Kapil did this feat in the ODI against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata in 1991
 kapil se pehle unke hi rajya haryana ke chetan sharma ne vanade main hetric darj kii thi

 Appreciating India for adopting a 'fair stand' on the South China Sea issue despite pressure from the US and Japan, China's state media today said that there may be some contradictions and differences between the two countries, but overall But the bilateral relations between them have been developing seamlessly

 Gandhian Anna Hazare warned the government to go on hunger strike again from August 16, accusing the government of "turning back on promises" on the issue of Lokpal Bill
 vahiin, sarkaar ne kaha ki vah ‘samanaantar’ dhaancha taiyaar nahin hone de sakati
 Amidst stance and tightening by both sides, the government made it clear that by June 30, it would be able to draft a 'strict and vigorous' draft of the Lokpal Bill, whether the members of the society cooperate or not
 sanyukt masauda samiti kii 15 june ko hui baithak main donon pakshon ke bich gatirodh or gaharaa jane ke baad hazaare ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar kaa majboot bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon banane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 He said that the government was withdrawing from its promise to accept all the suggestions of the members of the society
 april main anshan kar desh bhar main sukhiryon main aane or sarkaar ko chintaa main daal dene vaale hazaare ne kaha ki agar kamjor vidheyak laane kii koshish kii gayi to vah 16 agast se phir anshan karenge
 Immediately after the press conference of Hazare and his fellow activists, Home Minister P
 K
, who was included as the representative of the Center in the Lokpal Drafting Committee
 chidambaram, maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri kapil sibbal or jal sansaadhan mantri salmaan khurshid ne bhi samvaadadaata sammelan kar samaaj ke sadasyon ko aade haath liya
 The ministers made it clear that the government would not bow down to threats like fast
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘aap ek taraf hamen dhamkee dekar duusari taraf baatcheet nahin kar sakate
 This is not the way to proceed
 sarkaar apamaanon or juthi nindaaon ke kaaran mudde se apana dhyaan nahin bhatakane degi
 'chidambaram said,' i do not think that fasting is the way to draft a bill anywhere in the world
 ’ chidambaram ne kaha ki hazaare paksh kii adhiktar maangen sweekaar nahin kii ja saktin kyonki sarkaar apane samanaantar koi dhaancha khadaa nahin hone de sakati
 Sibal also said, 'we cannot allow a parallel government to be created outside the government that controls every function of the government
 is mudde par hamaare (sarkaar or hazaare paksh ke) bich gambhir matbhed hai
 Chidambaram said that the fundamentals of the Constitution cannot be changed and the political process has to be respected
 unhone kaha, ‘kanoon sansad banaati he
 The Congress is not the only elected party
 kai anya dal bhi hai
 You have to respect the political process
 kya chaha gaya he or kya sambhav he, isamen antar he
 Reiterating the government's commitment to formulate an effective Lokpal Bill, Sibal said, "once the Parliament passes, most people of the country will say that good work has been done
" ’ naukarshahon ke khilaaf jaanch ke liye 11 sadasyeey lokapal ko adhikaar dene kii maang par sibbal ne kaha, ‘sarkaar kis tarah se apni shakti ko aniyantrit tareeke se baant sakati he
 He said that if these powers were given to the Lokpal, the bureaucrats would become loyal to the Lokpal rather than the government
 sibbal ne kaha, ‘ham buniyadi dhaanche main is tarah ke badlaav ke khilaaf hai
 'he said that there was a' discussion 'in the joint draft committee meeting which cannot be termed as' decision' under the charge of Hazare's side
 chidambaram ne bhi lokapal vidheyak par janamat sangrah karaane kii maang ko khaarij karte hue kaha ki samvidhan main is tarah ke kisi upaay kaa zikr nahin he
 He wondered if such a bill could be put to vote provision-by-provision
 mantriyon ne lokapal ko sarvaadhik shaktishaalee nikaay banane ke bare main aagaah karte hue kaha ki agar lokapal yaa uske adhikari hi bhrasht ho jaayenge to unhen kaise niyantrit kiya jaayegaa
 On the controversial issue of bringing the Prime Minister under the purview of Lokpal, Chidambaram said that there are many possibilities in this regard
 aisa spasht rup se nirdhaarit apwaadon yaa vyakti ke pad chhod dene ke baad kiya ja saktaa he
 He said, 'no decision has been taken in this regard
 yah charchaa kaa vishay he
 Sibal said that the Prime Minister is the focal point of parliamentary democracy
 agar pradhanmantri ke khilaaf aarope lagate hai to jaanch hone tak vah kaam nahin kar paayenge
 He said, 'meanwhile, you will also lose the credibility of the institute
 ve pradhanmantri ko bataur vyakti dekh sakate hai lekin ham pradhanmantri ko ek santhaan ke rup main dekhte hai
 We want to save the institution
 ’ udhar, anna hazaare ne lokapal masauda vidheyak ke do sanskaran cabinet ko bhejne ke sarkaar ke nirnay par ‘aashcharya’ jataayaa
 He said, 'surprised that the government is asking to send two different versions of the draft to the cabinet
 agar aisa hi karnaa tha to lokapal masauda samiti ke gathan kaa kya auchity rahaa
 Why was so much time wasted? isse saaf hota he ki sarkaar kii prabhaavshaalee vidhyek taiyaar karne kii koi manshaa nahin he
 The government does not want to end corruption
 ’hazaare ne samvaadadaata sammelan main aarope lagaaya, ‘jab april main maine anshan kiya tha to sarkaar ne hamaare sabhi suzav maanane kaa vaada kiya tha
 Now the government is retracting its promises
 agar kamazor vidheyak laayaa gaya to main 16 agast se jantar mantar par phir anshan karuunga

 The two countries had mutually agreed to withdraw their armies from Doklam
 haalanki china kaa kahana tha ki uski sena doklam main petroling karti rahegi
 What was the Doklam dispute? It is worth mentioning that India and Chinese army were face to face for more than two months in Doklam near Sikkim border sector
 yah gatirodh tab shuru hua jab is ilaake main chini sena dwaara kiye jane vaale sadak nirmaan kaary ko bhartiya sainikon ne roak diya
 India's concern was that if China managed to build a road in Doklam, it would be easier for it to block access to the rest of India at any time in the north-east
 doklam ilaake ko bhutan apana maanata he, lekin china kaa daawa he ki yah uske kshetra main aata he

 par is baar piem modi baba kedarnath ke darshan ke alaava kedarpuri main ek jansabha ko bhi sambodhit karenge
 PM Modi will also lay the foundation stone for various schemes and development works in Kedarnath
 vah kedarnath main saraswati-mandakini kii suraksha diwaar, shankaracharya kii samadhisthal kaa punarnirmaan, tirth purohiton ke 70 bhawan or raaston ke chaudeekaran kaa shilanyas karenge
 PM Modi will arrive at Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun from Delhi at eight in the morning on October 20, from where he will go directly to Baba Kedar's Dham by MI-17 helicopter
 baba kedaar ke darshan karne ke baad vah nai kedarpuri ko nae andaaj main viksit karne ko lekar kai yojanaon kaa anaavaran karenge
 After this, PM Modi will address a public meeting in Kedarnath at 10:40 pm and then leave for Delhi from Jolly Grant at 11:40 pm

 saal 2013 main kedarnath main baadh ne machaai thi tabahisaal 2013 menkedarnaathmen baadh ne bheeshan tabaahi machaai thi

 is tabah ke baad modi kedarpuri ko apane tareeke se viksit karnaa chaahate the, lekin tatkaaleen mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna ne unke prastaav ko thukraa diya tha
 Perhaps this is the reason that when the Prime Minister went to Kedarnath six months from now, after seeing the signs of ruin with his own eyes, he returned after making up his mind to build a new Kedarpuri
 ab jab kapaat band hone ke vakt wo ja rahe hai, to darshan ke saath hi nai kedarpuri ke shilanyas kaa kaam bhi puraa karenge
 PM Modi wants to rebuild Kedarnath, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also believes that after the natural disaster of 2013, PM Modi wanted to rebuild Kedarnath, but the state Congress government headed by then Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna It was not allowed
 ravat kaa kahana he ki shaayad yahi wo yaaden hai, jo piem modi ko kedarnath laayi hai
 Now Kedarpuri will be renovated by the country's prestigious Vastu Shastri
 kedarnath se sabhi hinduon kaa lagaav he or yahi lagaav modi ko bhi he

 Notorious underworld don Chhota Rajan is caught
 lekin rajan bharat kii bajaae zimbabwe janaa chahta he, jahaan wo kai saalon tak rahaa he
 Chhota Rajan said this during interrogation to the Bali CID officer who caught him at the Bali International Airport on Sunday afternoon
 major rinhard chif siaidi afasar bali hai
 He is the major who arrested underworld don Chhota Rajan at the Bali International Airport on Sunday afternoon
 rinhard se poochtacha main rajan ne kaha ki vah india nahin janaa chahta kyonki vahaan use apni jaan kaa khatra he
 Chota Rajan requested the same Major Reinhard to help him in some way from Bali to Zimbabwe
 major rinhard ke mutabik ravivaar yani 25 oktober kii dopaher unhen interpol ke jariye austrailian fedral police se ek passport number mila tha or kaha gaya tha ki us shaks ko airport par hi pakad liya jaae kyonki uske khilaaf red carnor notice he
 According to the major, the passport number was found but the name was written on it
 lekin photo vahi tha jo red carnor notice main laga tha
 After getting the photo, Major took Chhota Rajan into custody, after a long questioning, Rajan finally accepted that he is Chhota Rajan
 lekin abhi tak bali police ko ye andaja nahin tha ki jis shaks ko usne pakadaa he wo kitna bada or khatarnaak don he
 This was realized when news of Rajan's arrest was reported to Interpol
 interpol ke jariye jaise hi ye khabar jakarta main bhartiya duutavas or phir dilli main sibiai ko mili hadakamp much gaya
 During the interrogation, Chhota Rajan told many things
 apane maa-baap, patni ke bare main bhi usne bolaa
 But he is not talking about d Company or Dawood Ibrahim
 bali police kii maane to kanuunan bees dinon ke andar-andar chota rajan ko bharat deport karnaa jaruri he
 
 agar sab kuch thik rahaa to wo usase bahut pehle bhi bharat laayaa ja saktaa he
 During interrogation, Rajan also revealed that he had been living in Sydney for the last seven years and before that he lived in Zimbabwe
 giraftaar ke baad chota rajan ne bali se zimbabwe jane ke liye siaidi afasar se madad bhi maangi
 If there is no crime connection of Chhota Rajan in Indonesia, then the CBI will not have to go through a long process of extradition treaty to bring him to India
 aisi surat main use sidhe bharat deport kar diya jayega
 Because he is an Indian citizen
 aise kisi bhi cese main koi bhi desh bees din se zyada kisi ko roak kar nahin rakh saktaa
 After the arrest of Chhota Rajan, within the next twenty days i
e
 before November 15, Indonesia will have to report it to India

 zyaadaatar mahilaayein mechap karne kii shaukeen hoti hai
 But keeping makeup fresh during the summer season is a big challenge in itself
 darasal, garmi ke mausam main adhik pasinaa aane se mechap jaldi kharaab ho jaataa he
 Many people have a rash on their skin
 garmiyon ke mausam main mechap karnaa har mahila kii samasya hoti he
 But now you do not have to worry, because today we are telling you some tips, with the help of which you can keep your makeup fresh even in summer
 1
 Start makeup with moisturizer - Whether it is summer or winter, moisturizer is very important to keep the skin soft
 lekin garmi ke mausam main hameshaa oil free moischarizer kaa hi istemaal karen
 Also set up Oil Free Foundation
 2
 Must apply sunscreen - To protect skin damage from scorching sun, apply sunscreen
 sanscreen kaa istemaal mechap karne se pehle hi karen
 Let me tell you, the effect of sunscreen lasts only for two to two and a half hours
 isliye dhoop main nikalne se pehle is baat kaa dhyaan jarur rakhen
 3
 primer he jaruri-moischarizer ke baad chehre par primer jarur lagaaein
 Applying primer keeps the makeup fresh for a long time
 isse chehre kii jhurriyaan bhi kam najar aati hai, saath hi porce bhi cover ho jate hai
 4
 bronger se den chehre ko glo- garmiyon kii chilchilaati dhoop main fresh dikhaane main bronger kii ahm bhoomika hoti he
 According to the makeup artist, bronzer should be used only at the high point of the face, where there are direct rays of the sun, such as forehead, chin, nose etc
 5
 Use less makeup products - Many women find their makeup very quickly
 isse bachane ke liye kam se kam mechap products kaa istemaal karen
 6
 shimer se dur rahen-zyaadaar mahilaon ko gloi mechap luk bahut pasand hota he
 But there is a difference between using natural glow makeup and excessive shimmer to make makeup glowy
 garmiyon ke mausam main kriim foundation lagane se bachein, kyonki isse chehre par adhik pasinaa aata he or mechap jaldi kharaab ho jaataa he
