 Of course when Prime Minister Modi's turn comes, he will say that only then i am talking about cleaning the Ganges
 ho jaataa he raajnneeti main rupakon ke istamaal main gadabadi ho jaati he
 After this, the Congress leaders also gave arrest after which he left
 nagpur ke ishaare par sarkaar chalati he
 Sonia Gandhi accused the Modi government
 jab congress kii sarkaar thi tab bijepi aarope lagaataa thi ki manmohan sarkaar das janpath ke ishaare par chalati he
 From both the talks, it seems that the Indian government can follow the instructions
 uttarakhand ko lekar congress kaa yah pradarshan tha to bijepi kaa agusta westland ko lekar
 The BJP began to remind itself of the Emergency during the Congress rule
 isi bich supreme court se faisla aayaa ki das may ko do ghante ke liye raashtrapati shashan hatega or uttarakhand kii vidhansabha main harish ravat ko apana bahumat sabit karnaa hoga
 The process of majority will be under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 9 baagi vidhayak vishwaas mat main hissaa nahin le sakenge
 This made the Congress excited
 sochie agar supreme court hai court ke faisle ko palat detaa to jantar mantar par loktantr ko bachaane ke liye pahunchi congress kii kya haalat hoti
 The decision was welcomed by the Congress and the BJP, as both protested on Friday
 jantar mantar par mahilaon kaa kores gaan tha to kahin nukcd naatak kaa prabandh tha
 The Congress came to Jantar Mantar with complete preparation
 poster main kaaphi badlaav or nayaapan tha lekin ek chehre ko dekhakar patrkaar hairaan ho gaye ki loktantr bachaane ke bich main robert wadra kya kar rahe hai
 He is a private citizen
 kahin unhen bhi to isi bahaane bachaane kaa prayaas nahin ho rahaa he
 However, the result of the investigation against them has not been revealed yet
 is poster ke kaaran congress kaaryakarta jagadish sharma kii bhi kawarej khub ho gai
 Congress had to reply that Jagdish Sharma put this poster without recognition
 yahaan par priyanka gandhi kii bhi tasviir dekhi gai
 Meanwhile, it was also seen that a young Congress MP is struggling to take selfie with Ambika Soni
 ambika ji bhi jhenp gayi
 Whether or not the young man has managed to take a selfie is not known
 in pradarshnon se mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko bhi kuch kehane kaa mauka mil gaya
 In the first-time government, when Kejriwal was sitting on a dharna while the Chief Minister, there was a lot of criticism and even joked that the CM also sits on the dharna
 baad main research hone laga ki pehle koun koun baith chukaa he
 The demonstration by the Congress BJP gave Kejriwal a chance to settle his old account
 bijepi or congress donon dharna party hai
 Both of them picket every day
 aaj bijepi apane hi khilaaf dharne par he
 You are the only one who is living up to governance
 yah bas yaad dilaane ke liye ki jab dharanon kaa daur chal rahaa tha tab dilli main dharanon ko lekar kya-kya baaten ho rahi thim
 The demonstration shows how vibrant our democracy is
 isse yah bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki tantra to jeevant he or loktantr ke saamne sangharsh karte-karte mrityuparyant mudra main aa chukaa he
 Sometimes when others perform we do not pay attention
 bhul jate hai ki hamaari bhi baari aa sakati he
 When our turn comes, we also start complaining that nothing can happen in this democracy
 kisi ko yahaan fark kyon nahin padataa he
 On Thursday, Anganwadi workers performed at Jantar Mantar
 magar inkaa live kawarej nahin hua hoga
 Hundreds of Anganwadi workers came from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP, Rajasthan
 inaki maang he anganwari workaron ko sthai kiya jaae or sarkari karmchaaree kaa darja mili
 The worker gets a salary of 24 thousand and the helper gets 18 thousand months
 pichley bajet se aisidi es yojana kaa paisa kam kiya ja rahaa he
 It is affecting nutrition
 shuukravaar ko bhi itio par dilli ke anganwari workaron ne pradarshan kiya
 Very rarely did we get the picture of the ITO performance
 pataa chalaa ki pichley chalis saal se desh bhar main anganwari mahilaayein apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahi hai
 There is a sit-in in the state capital
 dilli aakar bhi dharna hota he
 The memorandum is given to the Minister of Social and Child Welfare and after that the preparation for the next demonstration starts again
 isiilie maine kaha ki ek naagarik ke taur par kai baar ham aise jaruri dharna-pradarshnon ke prati udasin ho jate hai
 Many times such pickets get enthralled by demonstrations where the real issues are less, the slogans are more
 jantar mantar or sansad parisar kii gandhi murti ke pradarshan kii tasviir pehle panne par hogi
 You can also find pictures of demonstrations of Anganwadi workers
 kis pej number par hoti he
 There was also a demonstration on 15 February 2016
 phir hamane situ se poocha ki aap log anganwari workaron ko lekar kab se pradarshan kar rahe hai to haal philhal ke kuch pradarshan ginane lage ki 2006 kii bhukh hadtaal par mahilaayein baithi thim
 Two million were signed in 2008
 2010 main 17000 workaron ne do din or do raat kaa andolan kiya tha
 In 2011 marched till Parliament
 10 july 2013 ko desh bhar main chaar lakh anganwari varkar sadakon par utrin or kaala diwas manaaya
 Took march to Parliament with 2 crore signatures in 2014 2015 main bhi sansad tak march nikaala
 Anganwadi is a big social event not only in India but in the world
 anganwari kaaryakartaaon kii kamai bhi bahut nahin hoti
 3000 rupees per month
 hamane ek anganwari varkar se poocha ki ve punjab se kaise aati hai to bataaya ki sari mahilaayein paanch-paanch sau rupee detii hai
 Buses are hired and then come to Jantar Mantar to sit
 ve apni is bhoomika se loktantr ko kitna samrudh karti hai aap sirf itnaa soch len to inke prati shraddha umad aegi
 Different states have different salaries, different conditions
 kerala main das hajaar vetan miltaa he to kai rajyon main nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam 3000 rupee
 If the Anganwadi worker had come in the category of mother and goddess type, then the emotional bond would have been tied
 kya pataa sarkarein apana khajaana inke liye khol deteen
 The problem is that rich and middle class women also get the medals of mother and goddess
 desh bhar main anganwari ke 14 lakh centre hai or 27 lakh varkar hai
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he
 12th pass is required for worker
 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa
 The Congress also says that no allegations have been proved against Kanhaiya
 hamaare sahyogi parimal kumaar jeenyu ke maamle par lagaataar report kar rahe hai
 Parimal said that many alumni of JNU will sit on the relay hunger strike from Saturday
 shanivaar paanch baje ganga dhaba se chaatr, abhibhavak or shikshak milakar prashasnic blaak tak maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar jaaenge
 Many people comment on Facebook and create a democratic atmosphere
 kai baar twitor se andolan bhi chalaa dete hai jaise haal hi main amrapali group se flats kharidne waalon ne kiya
 Many times people get tired of running hashtags on Twitter, the atmosphere does not get created
 pehle hi apadidiai footware dizine and deveopment institute ke chaatr bhi khub twit karte rahe, jantar mantar par pradarshan karte rahe ki unhen degree kii jagah diploma diya ja rahaa he
 According to PTI, the Ministry of Commerce has asked the Ministry of Human Resources to consider their demand
 darasal aapako yah bhi samajhnaa he ki yah jo roj raat ko tivi par ghanta-ghanta bahes hoti he use ham bhi karte hai or aap bhi khub chatkhaare lekar dekhte hai
 Enjoyed that the BJP Congress tasted good
 is khel main ankar nayak banataa ja rahaa he or desh kii kai samasyaayein peeche chhootati ja rahi hai
 The problems of ordinary people are not getting voice
 nateeja mujhe hi sainkadon chitthiyaan aati hai
 Many emails come
 main apni baat bataa rahaa hum
 While i do not even have a rating
 jin channelon ko number van kii reating aati he unke ankar ko to lakhon main log chitthiyaan likhte honge
 About their problems
 is kaaran yah bhi ho rahaa he ki rajyon or kasbon se khabaren dilli tak chalakar nahin aa paati hai
 As the movement is taking place in Allahabad University also
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 sansad parisar ke bheetar bijepi saansad dharne par baithe the to jantar mantar par congress loktantr bachaao pradarshan kar rahi thi
 It seemed that the leaders of both the party were standing on the terrace to see that there was more crowd in their performance and where loud slogans were being raised
 congress ke pradarshan main purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh bhi aae
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi also arrived
 jantar mantar kaa pradarshan channelon par khub live dikhaaya gaya
 Congress leaders were speaking from the stage that democracy is being strangled in the country
 sansthaaon par sangh kaa kabza ho rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that only two people walk in the country
 pradhanmantri modi or sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat
 All the leaders, from Sonia Gandhi to Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, criticized the Modi government for imposing President's rule
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki ve kisi se darane vaali nahin hai
 In the Lok Sabha, Jyotiraditya Scindia said that Sonia Gandhi is a lioness
 sherni he
 If you chase the lioness, you will know what the answer is
 chappan inch kaa seenaa agar loktantr main ek kharaab roopak he to netaaon ko sherni kii tarah pesh karnaa bhi kharaab roopak he
 This is my personal opinion
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki main modi sarkaar se kahana chahta hum ki congress bahati ganga kii tarah he
 Whether you discredit it or do something, it will not change its course
 ganga ke roopak ne bhi bijepi ko mauka de diya
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar replied why are you worried
 maine to kisi kaa naam nahin liya
 You must know where the Ganges is going
 tyaagi or khetaan to chote log hai jinhone bas bahati ganga main haath dhoyaa he
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Modi was passionate about Ganga, after losing the election, Manmohan Singh was passionate about Ganga, then the BJP must have been surprised
 is politics main jarur maa ganga kanfus ho gai hongi
 Of course when Prime Minister Modi's turn comes, he will say that only then i am talking about cleaning the Ganges
 ho jaataa he raajnneeti main rupakon ke istamaal main gadabadi ho jaati he
 After this, the Congress leaders also gave arrest after which he left
 nagpur ke ishaare par sarkaar chalati he
 Sonia Gandhi accused the Modi government
 jab congress kii sarkaar thi tab bijepi aarope lagaataa thi ki manmohan sarkaar das janpath ke ishaare par chalati he
 From both the talks, it seems that the Indian government can follow the instructions
 uttarakhand ko lekar congress kaa yah pradarshan tha to bijepi kaa agusta westland ko lekar
 The BJP began to remind itself of the Emergency during the Congress rule
 isi bich supreme court se faisla aayaa ki das may ko do ghante ke liye raashtrapati shashan hatega or uttarakhand kii vidhansabha main harish ravat ko apana bahumat sabit karnaa hoga
 The process of majority will be under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 9 baagi vidhayak vishwaas mat main hissaa nahin le sakenge
 This made the Congress excited
 sochie agar supreme court hai court ke faisle ko palat detaa to jantar mantar par loktantr ko bachaane ke liye pahunchi congress kii kya haalat hoti

 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 jantar mantar kaa pradarshan channelon par khub live dikhaaya gaya
 Congress leaders were speaking from the stage that democracy is being strangled in the country
 sansthaaon par sangh kaa kabza ho rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi said that only two people walk in the country
 pradhanmantri modi or sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat
 All the leaders, from Sonia Gandhi to Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, criticized the Modi government for imposing President's rule
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki ve kisi se darane vaali nahin hai
 In the Lok Sabha, Jyotiraditya Scindia said that Sonia Gandhi is a lioness
 sherni he
 If you chase the lioness, you will know what the answer is
 chappan inch kaa seenaa agar loktantr main ek kharaab roopak he to netaaon ko sherni kii tarah pesh karnaa bhi kharaab roopak he
 This is my personal opinion
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki main modi sarkaar se kahana chahta hum ki congress bahati ganga kii tarah he
 Whether you discredit it or do something, it will not change its course
 ganga ke roopak ne bhi bijepi ko mauka de diya
 Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar replied why are you worried
 maine to kisi kaa naam nahin liya
 You must know where the Ganges is going
 tyaagi or khetaan to chote log hai jinhone bas bahati ganga main haath dhoyaa he
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Modi was passionate about Ganga, after losing the election, Manmohan Singh was passionate about Ganga, then the BJP must have been surprised
 is politics main jarur maa ganga kanfus ho gai hongi
 Of course when Prime Minister Modi's turn comes, he will say that only then i am talking about cleaning the Ganges
 ho jaataa he raajnneeti main rupakon ke istamaal main gadabadi ho jaati he
 After this, the Congress leaders also gave arrest after which he left
 nagpur ke ishaare par sarkaar chalati he
 Sonia Gandhi accused the Modi government
 jab congress kii sarkaar thi tab bijepi aarope lagaataa thi ki manmohan sarkaar das janpath ke ishaare par chalati he
 From both the talks, it seems that the Indian government can follow the instructions
 uttarakhand ko lekar congress kaa yah pradarshan tha to bijepi kaa agusta westland ko lekar
 The BJP began to remind itself of the Emergency during the Congress rule
 isi bich supreme court se faisla aayaa ki das may ko do ghante ke liye raashtrapati shashan hatega or uttarakhand kii vidhansabha main harish ravat ko apana bahumat sabit karnaa hoga
 The process of majority will be under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 9 baagi vidhayak vishwaas mat main hissaa nahin le sakenge
 This made the Congress excited
 sochie agar supreme court hai court ke faisle ko palat detaa to jantar mantar par loktantr ko bachaane ke liye pahunchi congress kii kya haalat hoti
 The decision was welcomed by the Congress and the BJP, as both protested on Friday
 jantar mantar par mahilaon kaa kores gaan tha to kahin nukcd naatak kaa prabandh tha
 The Congress came to Jantar Mantar with complete preparation
 poster main kaaphi badlaav or nayaapan tha lekin ek chehre ko dekhakar patrkaar hairaan ho gaye ki loktantr bachaane ke bich main robert wadra kya kar rahe hai
 He is a private citizen
 kahin unhen bhi to isi bahaane bachaane kaa prayaas nahin ho rahaa he
 However, the result of the investigation against them has not been revealed yet
 is poster ke kaaran congress kaaryakarta jagadish sharma kii bhi kawarej khub ho gai
 Congress had to reply that Jagdish Sharma put this poster without recognition
 yahaan par priyanka gandhi kii bhi tasviir dekhi gai
 Meanwhile, it was also seen that a young Congress MP is struggling to take selfie with Ambika Soni
 ambika ji bhi jhenp gayi
 Whether or not the young man has managed to take a selfie is not known
 in pradarshnon se mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko bhi kuch kehane kaa mauka mil gaya
 In the first-time government, when Kejriwal was sitting on a dharna while the Chief Minister, there was a lot of criticism and even joked that the CM also sits on the dharna
 baad main research hone laga ki pehle koun koun baith chukaa he
 The demonstration by the Congress BJP gave Kejriwal a chance to settle his old account
 bijepi or congress donon dharna party hai
 Both of them picket every day
 aaj bijepi apane hi khilaaf dharne par he
 You are the only one who is living up to governance
 yah bas yaad dilaane ke liye ki jab dharanon kaa daur chal rahaa tha tab dilli main dharanon ko lekar kya-kya baaten ho rahi thim
 The demonstration shows how vibrant our democracy is
 isse yah bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki tantra to jeevant he or loktantr ke saamne sangharsh karte-karte mrityuparyant mudra main aa chukaa he
 Sometimes when others perform we do not pay attention
 bhul jate hai ki hamaari bhi baari aa sakati he
 When our turn comes, we also start complaining that nothing can happen in this democracy
 kisi ko yahaan fark kyon nahin padataa he
 On Thursday, Anganwadi workers performed at Jantar Mantar
 magar inkaa live kawarej nahin hua hoga
 Hundreds of Anganwadi workers came from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP, Rajasthan
 inaki maang he anganwari workaron ko sthai kiya jaae or sarkari karmchaaree kaa darja mili
 The worker gets a salary of 24 thousand and the helper gets 18 thousand months
 pichley bajet se aisidi es yojana kaa paisa kam kiya ja rahaa he
 It is affecting nutrition
 shuukravaar ko bhi itio par dilli ke anganwari workaron ne pradarshan kiya
 Very rarely did we get the picture of the ITO performance
 pataa chalaa ki pichley chalis saal se desh bhar main anganwari mahilaayein apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahi hai
 There is a sit-in in the state capital
 dilli aakar bhi dharna hota he
 The memorandum is given to the Minister of Social and Child Welfare and after that the preparation for the next demonstration starts again
 isiilie maine kaha ki ek naagarik ke taur par kai baar ham aise jaruri dharna-pradarshnon ke prati udasin ho jate hai
 Many times such pickets get enthralled by demonstrations where the real issues are less, the slogans are more
 jantar mantar or sansad parisar kii gandhi murti ke pradarshan kii tasviir pehle panne par hogi
 You can also find pictures of demonstrations of Anganwadi workers
 kis pej number par hoti he
 There was also a demonstration on 15 February 2016
 phir hamane situ se poocha ki aap log anganwari workaron ko lekar kab se pradarshan kar rahe hai to haal philhal ke kuch pradarshan ginane lage ki 2006 kii bhukh hadtaal par mahilaayein baithi thim
 Two million were signed in 2008
 2010 main 17000 workaron ne do din or do raat kaa andolan kiya tha
 In 2011 marched till Parliament
 10 july 2013 ko desh bhar main chaar lakh anganwari varkar sadakon par utrin or kaala diwas manaaya
 Took march to Parliament with 2 crore signatures in 2014 2015 main bhi sansad tak march nikaala
 Anganwadi is a big social event not only in India but in the world
 anganwari kaaryakartaaon kii kamai bhi bahut nahin hoti
 3000 rupees per month
 hamane ek anganwari varkar se poocha ki ve punjab se kaise aati hai to bataaya ki sari mahilaayein paanch-paanch sau rupee detii hai
 Buses are hired and then come to Jantar Mantar to sit
 ve apni is bhoomika se loktantr ko kitna samrudh karti hai aap sirf itnaa soch len to inke prati shraddha umad aegi
 Different states have different salaries, different conditions
 kerala main das hajaar vetan miltaa he to kai rajyon main nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam 3000 rupee
 If the Anganwadi worker had come in the category of mother and goddess type, then the emotional bond would have been tied
 kya pataa sarkarein apana khajaana inke liye khol deteen
 The problem is that rich and middle class women also get the medals of mother and goddess
 desh bhar main anganwari ke 14 lakh centre hai or 27 lakh varkar hai
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he
 12th pass is required for worker
 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa
 The Congress also says that no allegations have been proved against Kanhaiya
 hamaare sahyogi parimal kumaar jeenyu ke maamle par lagaataar report kar rahe hai
 Parimal said that many alumni of JNU will sit on the relay hunger strike from Saturday
 shanivaar paanch baje ganga dhaba se chaatr, abhibhavak or shikshak milakar prashasnic blaak tak maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar jaaenge
 Many people comment on Facebook and create a democratic atmosphere
 kai baar twitor se andolan bhi chalaa dete hai jaise haal hi main amrapali group se flats kharidne waalon ne kiya
 Many times people get tired of running hashtags on Twitter, the atmosphere does not get created
 pehle hi apadidiai footware dizine and deveopment institute ke chaatr bhi khub twit karte rahe, jantar mantar par pradarshan karte rahe ki unhen degree kii jagah diploma diya ja rahaa he
 According to PTI, the Ministry of Commerce has asked the Ministry of Human Resources to consider their demand
 darasal aapako yah bhi samajhnaa he ki yah jo roj raat ko tivi par ghanta-ghanta bahes hoti he use ham bhi karte hai or aap bhi khub chatkhaare lekar dekhte hai
 Enjoyed that the BJP Congress tasted good
 is khel main ankar nayak banataa ja rahaa he or desh kii kai samasyaayein peeche chhootati ja rahi hai
 The problems of ordinary people are not getting voice
 nateeja mujhe hi sainkadon chitthiyaan aati hai
 Many emails come
 main apni baat bataa rahaa hum
 While i do not even have a rating
 jin channelon ko number van kii reating aati he unke ankar ko to lakhon main log chitthiyaan likhte honge
 About their problems
 is kaaran yah bhi ho rahaa he ki rajyon or kasbon se khabaren dilli tak chalakar nahin aa paati hai
 As the movement is taking place in Allahabad University also
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the

 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard

 jantar mantar or sansad parisar kii gandhi murti ke pradarshan kii tasviir pehle panne par hogi
 You can also find pictures of demonstrations of Anganwadi workers
 kis pej number par hoti he
 There was also a demonstration on 15 February 2016
 phir hamane situ se poocha ki aap log anganwari workaron ko lekar kab se pradarshan kar rahe hai to haal philhal ke kuch pradarshan ginane lage ki 2006 kii bhukh hadtaal par mahilaayein baithi thim
 Two million were signed in 2008
 2010 main 17000 workaron ne do din or do raat kaa andolan kiya tha
 In 2011 marched till Parliament
 10 july 2013 ko desh bhar main chaar lakh anganwari varkar sadakon par utrin or kaala diwas manaaya
 Took march to Parliament with 2 crore signatures in 2014 2015 main bhi sansad tak march nikaala
 Anganwadi is a big social event not only in India but in the world
 anganwari kaaryakartaaon kii kamai bhi bahut nahin hoti
 3000 rupees per month
 hamane ek anganwari varkar se poocha ki ve punjab se kaise aati hai to bataaya ki sari mahilaayein paanch-paanch sau rupee detii hai
 Buses are hired and then come to Jantar Mantar to sit
 ve apni is bhoomika se loktantr ko kitna samrudh karti hai aap sirf itnaa soch len to inke prati shraddha umad aegi
 Different states have different salaries, different conditions
 kerala main das hajaar vetan miltaa he to kai rajyon main nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam 3000 rupee
 If the Anganwadi worker had come in the category of mother and goddess type, then the emotional bond would have been tied
 kya pataa sarkarein apana khajaana inke liye khol deteen
 The problem is that rich and middle class women also get the medals of mother and goddess
 desh bhar main anganwari ke 14 lakh centre hai or 27 lakh varkar hai
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he
 12th pass is required for worker
 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa
 The Congress also says that no allegations have been proved against Kanhaiya

 Parimal said that many alumni of JNU will sit on the relay hunger strike from Saturday
 shanivaar paanch baje ganga dhaba se chaatr, abhibhavak or shikshak milakar prashasnic blaak tak maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar jaaenge
 Many people comment on Facebook and create a democratic atmosphere
 kai baar twitor se andolan bhi chalaa dete hai jaise haal hi main amrapali group se flats kharidne waalon ne kiya
 Many times people get tired of running hashtags on Twitter, the atmosphere does not get created
 pehle hi apadidiai footware dizine and deveopment institute ke chaatr bhi khub twit karte rahe, jantar mantar par pradarshan karte rahe ki unhen degree kii jagah diploma diya ja rahaa he
 According to PTI, the Ministry of Commerce has asked the Ministry of Human Resources to consider their demand
 darasal aapako yah bhi samajhnaa he ki yah jo roj raat ko tivi par ghanta-ghanta bahes hoti he use ham bhi karte hai or aap bhi khub chatkhaare lekar dekhte hai
 Enjoyed that the BJP Congress tasted good

 About their problems
 is kaaran yah bhi ho rahaa he ki rajyon or kasbon se khabaren dilli tak chalakar nahin aa paati hai
 As the movement is taking place in Allahabad University also
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue

 Some performances have great endurance

 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 jantar mantar par mahilaon kaa kores gaan tha to kahin nukcd naatak kaa prabandh tha
 The Congress came to Jantar Mantar with complete preparation
 poster main kaaphi badlaav or nayaapan tha lekin ek chehre ko dekhakar patrkaar hairaan ho gaye ki loktantr bachaane ke bich main robert wadra kya kar rahe hai
 He is a private citizen
 kahin unhen bhi to isi bahaane bachaane kaa prayaas nahin ho rahaa he
 However, the result of the investigation against them has not been revealed yet
 is poster ke kaaran congress kaaryakarta jagadish sharma kii bhi kawarej khub ho gai
 Congress had to reply that Jagdish Sharma put this poster without recognition
 yahaan par priyanka gandhi kii bhi tasviir dekhi gai
 Meanwhile, it was also seen that a young Congress MP is struggling to take selfie with Ambika Soni
 ambika ji bhi jhenp gayi
 Whether or not the young man has managed to take a selfie is not known
 in pradarshnon se mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko bhi kuch kehane kaa mauka mil gaya
 In the first-time government, when Kejriwal was sitting on a dharna while the Chief Minister, there was a lot of criticism and even joked that the CM also sits on the dharna
 baad main research hone laga ki pehle koun koun baith chukaa he
 The demonstration by the Congress BJP gave Kejriwal a chance to settle his old account
 bijepi or congress donon dharna party hai
 Both of them picket every day
 aaj bijepi apane hi khilaaf dharne par he
 You are the only one who is living up to governance
 yah bas yaad dilaane ke liye ki jab dharanon kaa daur chal rahaa tha tab dilli main dharanon ko lekar kya-kya baaten ho rahi thim
 The demonstration shows how vibrant our democracy is
 isse yah bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki tantra to jeevant he or loktantr ke saamne sangharsh karte-karte mrityuparyant mudra main aa chukaa he
 Sometimes when others perform we do not pay attention
 bhul jate hai ki hamaari bhi baari aa sakati he
 When our turn comes, we also start complaining that nothing can happen in this democracy
 kisi ko yahaan fark kyon nahin padataa he
 On Thursday, Anganwadi workers performed at Jantar Mantar
 magar inkaa live kawarej nahin hua hoga
 Hundreds of Anganwadi workers came from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP, Rajasthan
 inaki maang he anganwari workaron ko sthai kiya jaae or sarkari karmchaaree kaa darja mili
 The worker gets a salary of 24 thousand and the helper gets 18 thousand months
 pichley bajet se aisidi es yojana kaa paisa kam kiya ja rahaa he
 It is affecting nutrition
 shuukravaar ko bhi itio par dilli ke anganwari workaron ne pradarshan kiya
 Very rarely did we get the picture of the ITO performance
 pataa chalaa ki pichley chalis saal se desh bhar main anganwari mahilaayein apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahi hai
 There is a sit-in in the state capital
 dilli aakar bhi dharna hota he
 The memorandum is given to the Minister of Social and Child Welfare and after that the preparation for the next demonstration starts again
 isiilie maine kaha ki ek naagarik ke taur par kai baar ham aise jaruri dharna-pradarshnon ke prati udasin ho jate hai
 Many times such pickets get enthralled by demonstrations where the real issues are less, the slogans are more
 jantar mantar or sansad parisar kii gandhi murti ke pradarshan kii tasviir pehle panne par hogi
 You can also find pictures of demonstrations of Anganwadi workers
 kis pej number par hoti he
 There was also a demonstration on 15 February 2016
 phir hamane situ se poocha ki aap log anganwari workaron ko lekar kab se pradarshan kar rahe hai to haal philhal ke kuch pradarshan ginane lage ki 2006 kii bhukh hadtaal par mahilaayein baithi thim
 Two million were signed in 2008
 2010 main 17000 workaron ne do din or do raat kaa andolan kiya tha
 In 2011 marched till Parliament

 Took march to Parliament with 2 crore signatures in 2014 2015 main bhi sansad tak march nikaala
 Anganwadi is a big social event not only in India but in the world
 anganwari kaaryakartaaon kii kamai bhi bahut nahin hoti
 3000 rupees per month
 hamane ek anganwari varkar se poocha ki ve punjab se kaise aati hai to bataaya ki sari mahilaayein paanch-paanch sau rupee detii hai
 Buses are hired and then come to Jantar Mantar to sit
 ve apni is bhoomika se loktantr ko kitna samrudh karti hai aap sirf itnaa soch len to inke prati shraddha umad aegi
 Different states have different salaries, different conditions
 kerala main das hajaar vetan miltaa he to kai rajyon main nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam 3000 rupee
 If the Anganwadi worker had come in the category of mother and goddess type, then the emotional bond would have been tied
 kya pataa sarkarein apana khajaana inke liye khol deteen
 The problem is that rich and middle class women also get the medals of mother and goddess
 desh bhar main anganwari ke 14 lakh centre hai or 27 lakh varkar hai
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he

 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women

 isse yah bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki tantra to jeevant he or loktantr ke saamne sangharsh karte-karte mrityuparyant mudra main aa chukaa he
 Sometimes when others perform we do not pay attention
 bhul jate hai ki hamaari bhi baari aa sakati he
 When our turn comes, we also start complaining that nothing can happen in this democracy
 kisi ko yahaan fark kyon nahin padataa he
 On Thursday, Anganwadi workers performed at Jantar Mantar
 magar inkaa live kawarej nahin hua hoga
 Hundreds of Anganwadi workers came from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP, Rajasthan
 inaki maang he anganwari workaron ko sthai kiya jaae or sarkari karmchaaree kaa darja mili
 The worker gets a salary of 24 thousand and the helper gets 18 thousand months
 pichley bajet se aisidi es yojana kaa paisa kam kiya ja rahaa he
 It is affecting nutrition
 shuukravaar ko bhi itio par dilli ke anganwari workaron ne pradarshan kiya
 Very rarely did we get the picture of the ITO performance
 pataa chalaa ki pichley chalis saal se desh bhar main anganwari mahilaayein apni maangon ko lekar dharna pradarshan kar rahi hai
 There is a sit-in in the state capital
 dilli aakar bhi dharna hota he
 The memorandum is given to the Minister of Social and Child Welfare and after that the preparation for the next demonstration starts again
 isiilie maine kaha ki ek naagarik ke taur par kai baar ham aise jaruri dharna-pradarshnon ke prati udasin ho jate hai
 Many times such pickets get enthralled by demonstrations where the real issues are less, the slogans are more
 jantar mantar or sansad parisar kii gandhi murti ke pradarshan kii tasviir pehle panne par hogi
 You can also find pictures of demonstrations of Anganwadi workers
 kis pej number par hoti he
 There was also a demonstration on 15 February 2016
 phir hamane situ se poocha ki aap log anganwari workaron ko lekar kab se pradarshan kar rahe hai to haal philhal ke kuch pradarshan ginane lage ki 2006 kii bhukh hadtaal par mahilaayein baithi thim
 Two million were signed in 2008
 2010 main 17000 workaron ne do din or do raat kaa andolan kiya tha
 In 2011 marched till Parliament
 10 july 2013 ko desh bhar main chaar lakh anganwari varkar sadakon par utrin or kaala diwas manaaya
 Took march to Parliament with 2 crore signatures in 2014 2015 main bhi sansad tak march nikaala
 Anganwadi is a big social event not only in India but in the world
 anganwari kaaryakartaaon kii kamai bhi bahut nahin hoti
 3000 rupees per month
 hamane ek anganwari varkar se poocha ki ve punjab se kaise aati hai to bataaya ki sari mahilaayein paanch-paanch sau rupee detii hai
 Buses are hired and then come to Jantar Mantar to sit
 ve apni is bhoomika se loktantr ko kitna samrudh karti hai aap sirf itnaa soch len to inke prati shraddha umad aegi
 Different states have different salaries, different conditions
 kerala main das hajaar vetan miltaa he to kai rajyon main nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam 3000 rupee
 If the Anganwadi worker had come in the category of mother and goddess type, then the emotional bond would have been tied
 kya pataa sarkarein apana khajaana inke liye khol deteen
 The problem is that rich and middle class women also get the medals of mother and goddess
 desh bhar main anganwari ke 14 lakh centre hai or 27 lakh varkar hai
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he
 12th pass is required for worker
 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa
 The Congress also says that no allegations have been proved against Kanhaiya
 hamaare sahyogi parimal kumaar jeenyu ke maamle par lagaataar report kar rahe hai
 Parimal said that many alumni of JNU will sit on the relay hunger strike from Saturday
 shanivaar paanch baje ganga dhaba se chaatr, abhibhavak or shikshak milakar prashasnic blaak tak maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar jaaenge
 Many people comment on Facebook and create a democratic atmosphere
 kai baar twitor se andolan bhi chalaa dete hai jaise haal hi main amrapali group se flats kharidne waalon ne kiya
 Many times people get tired of running hashtags on Twitter, the atmosphere does not get created
 pehle hi apadidiai footware dizine and deveopment institute ke chaatr bhi khub twit karte rahe, jantar mantar par pradarshan karte rahe ki unhen degree kii jagah diploma diya ja rahaa he
 According to PTI, the Ministry of Commerce has asked the Ministry of Human Resources to consider their demand
 darasal aapako yah bhi samajhnaa he ki yah jo roj raat ko tivi par ghanta-ghanta bahes hoti he use ham bhi karte hai or aap bhi khub chatkhaare lekar dekhte hai
 Enjoyed that the BJP Congress tasted good
 is khel main ankar nayak banataa ja rahaa he or desh kii kai samasyaayein peeche chhootati ja rahi hai
 The problems of ordinary people are not getting voice
 nateeja mujhe hi sainkadon chitthiyaan aati hai
 Many emails come
 main apni baat bataa rahaa hum
 While i do not even have a rating
 jin channelon ko number van kii reating aati he unke ankar ko to lakhon main log chitthiyaan likhte honge
 About their problems
 is kaaran yah bhi ho rahaa he ki rajyon or kasbon se khabaren dilli tak chalakar nahin aa paati hai
 As the movement is taking place in Allahabad University also
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 bijepi or congress donon dharna party hai
 Both of them picket every day
 aaj bijepi apane hi khilaaf dharne par he
 You are the only one who is living up to governance
 yah bas yaad dilaane ke liye ki jab dharanon kaa daur chal rahaa tha tab dilli main dharanon ko lekar kya-kya baaten ho rahi thim
 The demonstration shows how vibrant our democracy is
 isse yah bhi pataa chal jaataa he ki tantra to jeevant he or loktantr ke saamne sangharsh karte-karte mrityuparyant mudra main aa chukaa he
 Sometimes when others perform we do not pay attention

 bahut mushkil se ham itio vaale pradarshan kii tasviir hasil kar paae
 It was learned that for the last forty years, Anganwadi women across the country have been protesting against their demands
 rajyon kii rajdhani main dharna hota he
 There is a dharna coming to Delhi
 samaaj va bal kalyaan mantri ko gyaapan diya jaataa he or uske baad phir agle pradarshan kii taiyaari shuru ho jaati he
 That is why i said that as a citizen many times we become indifferent to such necessary picketing-demonstrations
 kai baar aise dharna pradarshnon se utsahit ho jate hai jahaan asli mudde kam hote hai, narebaaziyaan zyaada hoti hai
 The picture of the performance of Jantar Mantar and the Gandhi statue of the Parliament complex will be on the front page
 anganwari workaron ke pradarshnon kii tasviren aap khud bhi khojie
 Which page number is it on
 15 farvari 2016 ko bhi ek pradarshan hua tha
 Then we asked Situ how long you have been protesting for Anganwadi workers, then some recent demonstrations started counting that women were sitting on the hunger strike of 2006
 2008 main do karod hastakshar kiye the
 In 2010, 17000 workers staged a two-day and two-night agitation
 2011 main sansad tak march kiya
 On 10 July 2013, four lakh Anganwadi workers took to the streets across the country and celebrated Black Day
 2014 main 2 karod dastakhat ke saath sansad tak march nikaala
 In 2015 also marched till Parliament
 anganwari bharat hi nahin, duniya kaa ek bada saamaajik kaarykram he
 Anganwadi workers also do not earn much
 3000 rupaya maheene kaa miltaa he
 We asked an Anganwadi worker how they come from Punjab and told that all the women pay five to five hundred rupees
 bas kiraaye par leti hai or phir jantar mantar aakar dharna detii hai
 How much she enriches democracy with her role, if you just think so, she will be revered
 alag-alag rajyon main alag alag vetan hai, alag-alag sharten hai
 Kerala gets ten thousand salary, in many states less than the minimum wage of 3000 rupees
 anganwari varkar agar maa or devi tip kii catagori main aati to bhavuk samaa bandha jaataa
 What do the governments open their treasury for? dikkat yah he ki maa or devi kaa medal bhi amir or madhyamvargeey mahilaon ko mil jaataa he
 Anganwadi has 14 lakh centers and 27 lakh workers across the country
 anganwari kaa matlab kya he
 The Department of Social Welfare temporarily appoints workers after the interview
 varkar ke liye 12 veen paas hona jaruri he
 All women are women
 bacchon ko tike lagaana, khaanaa khilaanaa, mahilaon ko poshak tatwon kii jaankaree dena, yah sab inkaa kaam he
 If you perform for forty years, you should support them and understand the heart of that practice
 dikkat yah he ki jab tak maamla bhavuk nahin hota, usamen rashtrawaad yaa deshbhakti ke naam par yaa congress banaam bijepi ke naam par kutark karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti media, sarkaar, samaaj or aapmen se bhi kai in pradarshnon ko kamatar nigaah se dekhte hai
 Now see how much uproar there was in JNU in February and March
 sabaki raay ban gai
 Today the next phase of the same movement is going on in the same JNU
 kai dinon se left or abivipi ke chaatr anshan par baithe hai magar koi sunwaayee nahin
 The condition of students is also deteriorating
 tab bhi koi halchal nahin
 Leaders of the Left, Congress and JDU met the President in the evening on the issue of student hunger in JNU
 inhone raashtrapati se apil kii ki aap vizitor hai isliye is maamle main dakhal den
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Kanhaiya Kumar is in AIIMS, the condition of the remaining students is also deteriorating, so the President should intervene
 unhone kaha ki jo maamla court main he us par is tarah uniwarsity kaa faisla thik nahin he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh is to impose its ideology in educational institutions and to make those who are not qualified as Vice Chancellors
 congress kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kanhaiya par koi bhi aarope sabit nahin hua he
 Our colleague Parimal Kumar is continuously reporting on the JNU case
 parimal ne bataaya ki jeenyu ke kai purv chaatr shanivaar se riley hangar strike par baithenge
 At five o'clock on Saturday, students, parents and teachers from Ganga Dhaba will make a human chain to the administrative block

 Many times the movement is also carried out by tweeters like those who bought flats from Amrapali Group recently
 kai baar log twitor par hashtag chalaate-chalaate thak jate hai, maahaul nahin ban paata
 Already, students of FDDI Footwear Design and Development Institute have been tweeting a lot, demonstrating at Jantar Mantar that they are being given diplomas instead of degrees
 pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar vaanijya mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay se inaki maang par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Actually, you also have to understand that we do this every night which is an hour-and-hour debate on TV and you also watch it with a lot of chatter
 majaa aayaa ki bijepi congress ko majaa chakhaa diya
 Anchor is becoming a hero in this game and many problems of the country are being left behind
 aam logon kii samasyaon ko aawaaj nahin mil rahi he
 As a result i get hundreds of letters
 bahut se email aate hai
 i am saying my point
 jabaki meri to koi reating bhi nahin aati
 People who write the number one rating of their channels will write letters to their anchor in lakhs
 apni samasyaon ko lekar
 For this reason, it is also happening that news from states and towns does not come till Delhi
 jaise elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly
 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he
 The comments ludhiana kaa yah kissa suniye
 The Guardian stage is performing in Ludhiana from March 17
 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai
 These parents of Ludhiana also went on hunger strike on 5 April
 inkaa naaraa he niklo baahar makaanon se, jang lado beyimaanon se
 People are also chanting their own slogans
 band karo band karo, lootkhsot band karo
 Mummy papa do not sell gold bangles, tell the parent association the compulsions
 kya baat he
 
 
 Hats off to you guys
 mujhe pataa he main aapke saath jyaadati kar rahaa hum
 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive

 There was also a demonstration on 15 February 2016
 phir hamane situ se poocha ki aap log anganwari workaron ko lekar kab se pradarshan kar rahe hai to haal philhal ke kuch pradarshan ginane lage ki 2006 kii bhukh hadtaal par mahilaayein baithi thim
 Two million were signed in 2008
 2010 main 17000 workaron ne do din or do raat kaa andolan kiya tha
 In 2011 marched till Parliament
 10 july 2013 ko desh bhar main chaar lakh anganwari varkar sadakon par utrin or kaala diwas manaaya
 Took march to Parliament with 2 crore signatures in 2014 2015 main bhi sansad tak march nikaala
 Anganwadi is a big social event not only in India but in the world
 anganwari kaaryakartaaon kii kamai bhi bahut nahin hoti
 3000 rupees per month
 hamane ek anganwari varkar se poocha ki ve punjab se kaise aati hai to bataaya ki sari mahilaayein paanch-paanch sau rupee detii hai
 Buses are hired and then come to Jantar Mantar to sit
 ve apni is bhoomika se loktantr ko kitna samrudh karti hai aap sirf itnaa soch len to inke prati shraddha umad aegi
 Different states have different salaries, different conditions
 kerala main das hajaar vetan miltaa he to kai rajyon main nunatam mazdooree se bhi kam 3000 rupee
 If the Anganwadi worker had come in the category of mother and goddess type, then the emotional bond would have been tied
 kya pataa sarkarein apana khajaana inke liye khol deteen
 The problem is that rich and middle class women also get the medals of mother and goddess
 desh bhar main anganwari ke 14 lakh centre hai or 27 lakh varkar hai
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he
 12th pass is required for worker
 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa

 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point

 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya

 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive
 
 
 anganwari bharat hi nahin, duniya kaa ek bada saamaajik kaarykram he
 Anganwadi workers also do not earn much
 3000 rupaya maheene kaa miltaa he
 We asked an Anganwadi worker how they come from Punjab and told that all the women pay five to five hundred rupees
 bas kiraaye par leti hai or phir jantar mantar aakar dharna detii hai
 How much she enriches democracy with her role, if you just think so, she will be revered
 alag-alag rajyon main alag alag vetan hai, alag-alag sharten hai
 Kerala gets ten thousand salary, in many states less than the minimum wage of 3000 rupees
 anganwari varkar agar maa or devi tip kii catagori main aati to bhavuk samaa bandha jaataa
 What do the governments open their treasury for? dikkat yah he ki maa or devi kaa medal bhi amir or madhyamvargeey mahilaon ko mil jaataa he
 Anganwadi has 14 lakh centers and 27 lakh workers across the country
 anganwari kaa matlab kya he
 The Department of Social Welfare temporarily appoints workers after the interview
 varkar ke liye 12 veen paas hona jaruri he
 All women are women
 bacchon ko tike lagaana, khaanaa khilaanaa, mahilaon ko poshak tatwon kii jaankaree dena, yah sab inkaa kaam he
 If you perform for forty years, you should support them and understand the heart of that practice
 dikkat yah he ki jab tak maamla bhavuk nahin hota, usamen rashtrawaad yaa deshbhakti ke naam par yaa congress banaam bijepi ke naam par kutark karne kii sambhaavna nahin hoti media, sarkaar, samaaj or aapmen se bhi kai in pradarshnon ko kamatar nigaah se dekhte hai
 Now see how much uproar there was in JNU in February and March
 sabaki raay ban gai
 Today the next phase of the same movement is going on in the same JNU
 kai dinon se left or abivipi ke chaatr anshan par baithe hai magar koi sunwaayee nahin
 The condition of students is also deteriorating
 tab bhi koi halchal nahin
 Leaders of the Left, Congress and JDU met the President in the evening on the issue of student hunger in JNU
 inhone raashtrapati se apil kii ki aap vizitor hai isliye is maamle main dakhal den
 CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said that Kanhaiya Kumar is in AIIMS, the condition of the remaining students is also deteriorating, so the President should intervene
 unhone kaha ki jo maamla court main he us par is tarah uniwarsity kaa faisla thik nahin he
 At the same time, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh alleged that the agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Sangh is to impose its ideology in educational institutions and to make those who are not qualified as Vice Chancellors
 congress kaa yah bhi kahana he ki kanhaiya par koi bhi aarope sabit nahin hua he
 Our colleague Parimal Kumar is continuously reporting on the JNU case
 parimal ne bataaya ki jeenyu ke kai purv chaatr shanivaar se riley hangar strike par baithenge
 At five o'clock on Saturday, students, parents and teachers from Ganga Dhaba will make a human chain to the administrative block
 kai log twitor fasebuk par coment karke loktantric maahaul bana dete hai
 Many times the movement is also carried out by tweeters like those who bought flats from Amrapali Group recently
 kai baar log twitor par hashtag chalaate-chalaate thak jate hai, maahaul nahin ban paata
 Already, students of FDDI Footwear Design and Development Institute have been tweeting a lot, demonstrating at Jantar Mantar that they are being given diplomas instead of degrees
 pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar vaanijya mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay se inaki maang par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Actually, you also have to understand that we do this every night which is an hour-and-hour debate on TV and you also watch it with a lot of chatter
 majaa aayaa ki bijepi congress ko majaa chakhaa diya
 Anchor is becoming a hero in this game and many problems of the country are being left behind
 aam logon kii samasyaon ko aawaaj nahin mil rahi he
 As a result i get hundreds of letters
 bahut se email aate hai
 i am saying my point
 jabaki meri to koi reating bhi nahin aati
 People who write the number one rating of their channels will write letters to their anchor in lakhs
 apni samasyaon ko lekar
 For this reason, it is also happening that news from states and towns does not come till Delhi
 jaise elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly
 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he
 The comments ludhiana kaa yah kissa suniye
 The Guardian stage is performing in Ludhiana from March 17
 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai
 These parents of Ludhiana also went on hunger strike on 5 April
 inkaa naaraa he niklo baahar makaanon se, jang lado beyimaanon se
 People are also chanting their own slogans
 band karo band karo, lootkhsot band karo
 Mummy papa do not sell gold bangles, tell the parent association the compulsions
 kya baat he
 
 
 Hats off to you guys
 mujhe pataa he main aapke saath jyaadati kar rahaa hum
 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive
 ek din aapako bhi sadak par utarana hoga
 You can guess how sensitive governments can be
 bahut positive ho gaye hon to
 
 
 What does anganwadi mean? saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag intervyuu ke baad workaron kii asthai taur par niyukti karata he
 12th pass is required for worker
 sabhi mahilaayein hoti hai
 It is their job to provide vaccines to children, feed them, provide nutrients to women
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa
 The Congress also says that no allegations have been proved against Kanhaiya

 Parimal said that many alumni of JNU will sit on the relay hunger strike from Saturday
 shanivaar paanch baje ganga dhaba se chaatr, abhibhavak or shikshak milakar prashasnic blaak tak maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar jaaenge

 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road

 If you have become very positive
 
 
 chalis saal tak pradarshan karen to unka saath dena chahie or us sadhana ke marm ko samajhnaa chahie
 The problem is that unless the matter is sentimental, there is no possibility of misleading it in the name of nationalism or patriotism or in the name of Congress vs BJP, many of the media, government, society and many of you see these demonstrations with less eyesight
 ab dekhie farvari or march maheene main jeenyu ko lekar kitna hangaamaa hua
 Everyone's opinion was formed
 aaj usee jeenyu main usee andolan kaa aglaa charan chal rahaa he
 For several days, students of Left and ABVP have been sitting on hunger strike but no hearing
 chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he
 Even then there is no movement
 jeenyu main chaatro ke anshan ke mudde par shaam main left, congress or jediu ke netaa raashtrapati se mili
 He appealed to the President that you are a visitor, so interfere in this matter
 sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha ki kanhaiya kumaar ames main hai, baaki chaatro kii haalat bhi bighad rahi he, isliye raashtrapati ko dakhal dena chahie
 He said that the university's decision on the matter which is in the court is not right
 vahiin congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne aarope lagaaya ki bhartiya janata party or sangh kaa agenda he shikshan sansthaanon main apni vichaardhaara thopanaa or jo log yogya nahin hai unhen yogya bataakar vaais chancelar bananaa
 The Congress also says that no allegations have been proved against Kanhaiya
 hamaare sahyogi parimal kumaar jeenyu ke maamle par lagaataar report kar rahe hai
 Parimal said that many alumni of JNU will sit on the relay hunger strike from Saturday
 shanivaar paanch baje ganga dhaba se chaatr, abhibhavak or shikshak milakar prashasnic blaak tak maanav shrinkhalaa banaakar jaaenge
 Many people comment on Facebook and create a democratic atmosphere
 kai baar twitor se andolan bhi chalaa dete hai jaise haal hi main amrapali group se flats kharidne waalon ne kiya
 Many times people get tired of running hashtags on Twitter, the atmosphere does not get created
 pehle hi apadidiai footware dizine and deveopment institute ke chaatr bhi khub twit karte rahe, jantar mantar par pradarshan karte rahe ki unhen degree kii jagah diploma diya ja rahaa he
 According to PTI, the Ministry of Commerce has asked the Ministry of Human Resources to consider their demand
 darasal aapako yah bhi samajhnaa he ki yah jo roj raat ko tivi par ghanta-ghanta bahes hoti he use ham bhi karte hai or aap bhi khub chatkhaare lekar dekhte hai
 Enjoyed that the BJP Congress tasted good
 is khel main ankar nayak banataa ja rahaa he or desh kii kai samasyaayein peeche chhootati ja rahi hai
 The problems of ordinary people are not getting voice
 nateeja mujhe hi sainkadon chitthiyaan aati hai
 Many emails come
 main apni baat bataa rahaa hum
 While i do not even have a rating
 jin channelon ko number van kii reating aati he unke ankar ko to lakhon main log chitthiyaan likhte honge
 About their problems
 is kaaran yah bhi ho rahaa he ki rajyon or kasbon se khabaren dilli tak chalakar nahin aa paati hai
 As the movement is taking place in Allahabad University also
 har sarkaar or har rajya kii yahi haalat he
 If i start talking about the teachers hired on contract, i will continue to show their agony for ten to twelve days
 netaa chunaav ke dinon main manch par itane samvedansheel nazar aate hai ki lagata he ki kahin galati se ye kisi kii ungali main katane ke nishaan dekh len to behosh na ho jaaen
 After the elections, those who demand the same in front of these leaders and officers lose their senses while demanding
 ek tarah se avchetan kii avasthaa main chale jate hai
 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers

 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he

 kai log twitor fasebuk par coment karke loktantric maahaul bana dete hai
 Many times the movement is also carried out by tweeters like those who bought flats from Amrapali Group recently
 kai baar log twitor par hashtag chalaate-chalaate thak jate hai, maahaul nahin ban paata
 Already, students of FDDI Footwear Design and Development Institute have been tweeting a lot, demonstrating at Jantar Mantar that they are being given diplomas instead of degrees
 pitiai kii khabar ke anusaar vaanijya mantralay ne maanav sansaadhan mantralay se inaki maang par vichaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Actually, you also have to understand that we do this every night which is an hour-and-hour debate on TV and you also watch it with a lot of chatter
 majaa aayaa ki bijepi congress ko majaa chakhaa diya
 Anchor is becoming a hero in this game and many problems of the country are being left behind
 aam logon kii samasyaon ko aawaaj nahin mil rahi he
 As a result i get hundreds of letters
 bahut se email aate hai
 i am saying my point
 jabaki meri to koi reating bhi nahin aati
 People who write the number one rating of their channels will write letters to their anchor in lakhs
 apni samasyaon ko lekar
 For this reason, it is also happening that news from states and towns does not come till Delhi
 jaise elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main bhi andolan ho rahaa he
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly
 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he
 The comments ludhiana kaa yah kissa suniye
 The Guardian stage is performing in Ludhiana from March 17
 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai
 These parents of Ludhiana also went on hunger strike on 5 April
 inkaa naaraa he niklo baahar makaanon se, jang lado beyimaanon se
 People are also chanting their own slogans
 band karo band karo, lootkhsot band karo
 Mummy papa do not sell gold bangles, tell the parent association the compulsions
 kya baat he
 
 
 Hats off to you guys
 mujhe pataa he main aapke saath jyaadati kar rahaa hum
 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive
 ek din aapako bhi sadak par utarana hoga
 You can guess how sensitive governments can be
 bahut positive ho gaye hon to
 
 
 This is the condition of every government and every state
 theke par rakhe gaye shikshakon kii baat karne laguun to das baarah dinon tak unki vyathaa hi dikhaata rah jaaoongaa
 The leaders are so sensitive on the stage during election days that it seems that if they accidentally see the marks of cutting in someone's finger, do not faint
 chunaav ke baad inhen netaaon or afasaron ke aage maang karne vaale maang karte-karte hosh kho baithte hai
 In a way, we go into a state of subconsciousness
 maharashtra ke buldhana main peedbludi ke kaamkaaj par naaraazgi jaahir karne ke liye ensipi ke kaaryakartaaon ne unki meeting main nagin dance shuru kar diya
 Officers were also surprised by this unique protest that started suddenly
 darasal yahaan peedbludi vibhaag railway stesan ke paas footpath banane kaa kaam kar rahaa tha, lekin yah kaam achaanak roak diya gaya
 Many times people complained but when no action was taken, this unique method of protest was adopted
 yah kaaryakarta vikaas anusuchee ke liye chal rahi meeting main pahunche or apni baat rakhni chaahi
 Also performed a serpent dance for the protest
 ek or antar he
 As many opinions started coming in Delhi about the diesel ban, the diesel taxi drivers agitated
 jaise saare andolan hote hai vaise hi kiya
 But his movement was seen as an obstacle in the development of the country as it caused a long jam
 garib aadmi ko apni aawaaj pahunchane ke liye sadak par hi utarana hota he
 See the same opposition IT companies are also doing because their employees come and go from these diesel taxis
 inaki sanstha naiysakam ne sirf bayaan de diya ki deazal taxi band hone se ensiaar ke bipio udyog par asar padegaa or companiyaan yahaan se chali gayi to rojgaar kam ho jayega
 This was also a kind of threat but it has been seen as an economic warning
 is tarah dekha gaya jaise swaagat kii koi baat ho
 Taxi drivers were also saying that their employment would be affected but they were seen as villains
 kab kaisaa nazariyaa ho jaataa he pataa nahin chalata he
 You must have heard about the ASHA worker
 primary swasthya kendron tak garbhvatee mahilaon ko pahunchane kaa kaary karti hai
 Take for checkup every time so that the pregnant woman and baby can be properly looked after
 hamaare desh main janm se pehle, janm ke dauraan or janm ke baad bacchon ke marane kii sankhya kaaphi zyada he
 Obviously, the role of Asha Worker is quite important
 naam aashaa he magar inaki niraashaa ko koi nahin samajhane vaala
 On Friday, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav reached Firozabad when Asha Worker reached Murdabad
 police line main mukhyamantri karodon kii yojanaon kaa locarpan kar rahe the tabhi 100 aashaa mahilaayein pahunch gayi
 His patience broke down upon seeing the Chief Minister
 system ke prati aashaa kii bhi had hoti he
 Many Asha women fainted if there was no water there
 inaki maang thi ki gaanv-gaanv jaakar mahilaon ko prasav ke liye jila aspataal tak laati hai
 For this, you get hundred rupees per day
 baar-baar aashwaasan diya gaya ki sthai kiya jayega, magar abhi tak asthai naukari par hai
 The demand to increase allowance is also not met
 aap google karenge to pataa chalegaa ki 12 may ko uttarakhand kii aashaa mahilaon kaa pradarshan hone vaala he
 In a state, they get five hundred rupees per day and in a state three hundred
 kaam vahi he magar sarkaar kii marzi hui to maang suni jaaegi
 1000 rupees per day in Meghalaya
 jabaki inaki bhoomika aapke samaaj ko behatar karne ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he
 The comments ludhiana kaa yah kissa suniye
 The Guardian stage is performing in Ludhiana from March 17
 fees badhaane main skulon kii manamaani ke khilaaf inkaa pradarshan chal rahaa he
 These parents have also met the Deputy Commissioner
 maang kii ki unhone pandrah sadasyon kii cameti banaai thi, ab uske faisle ko lagu kiya jaae
 DC met with private school people and said that a solution would be found together
 ab aap ek baat bataaie
 All political parties vow for the general public, so why do they not participate in such demonstrations
 kya chunaav ke baad raajnneetik partiyaan janata ko chhod detii hai

 In order to express their displeasure over the functioning of the PWD in Buldhana, Maharashtra, NCP activists started a serpent dance at their meeting
 achaanak shuru hue is anokhe virodh pradarshan se afasar bhi hairaan the
 Actually the PWD department was working to construct the footpath near the railway station, but this work was suddenly stopped
 kai baar logon ne shikaayat kii lekin jab koi karrwai nahin hui to virodh pradarshan kaa yah anokhaa tarika apanaaya gaya
 These workers reached the ongoing meeting for the development schedule and wanted to make their point
 virodh ke liye nagin dance bhi kiya
 There is another difference
 jaise dilli main deazal bain ko lekar kai tarah kii raay aani shuru hui to dijal taxi chalaane waalon ne andolan kiya
 Like all movements are done
 magar unke andolan ko desh ke vikaas main baadha kii tarah dekha gaya kyonki isse lanbaa jam lag gaya
 The poor man has to get down on the road to make his voice heard
 vahi dekhie virodh iti companiyaan bhi kar rahi hai kyonki unke karmchaaree inhen deazal texiyon se aate-jate hai
 His organization NASSCOM just gave a statement that the closure of diesel taxi will affect the BPO industry of NCR and employment will be reduced if the companies leave from here
 yah bhi ek tarah kii dhamkee hi thi lekin ise aarthik chetavanee kii tarah dekha gaya he
 It was seen as if there was something to welcome
 taxi chaalak bhi yahi baat kah rahe the ki unke rojgaar par asar padegaa lekin unhen khalanaayak kii tarah dekha gaya
 It is not known when the attitude becomes
 aashaa kaaryakarta ke bare main aapane suna hi hoga
 Primary works to deliver pregnant women to health centers
 har baar chekup ke liye le janaa taaki garbhvatee mahila or bachche kii sahi dekharekh ho sake
 In our country, the number of children dying before birth, during birth and after birth is very high
 jaahir he aashaa varkar kii bhoomika kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 Hope is the name, but no one understands their disappointment
 shuukravaar ko upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav firozabad pahunche to aashaa varkar murdaabaad karne pahunch gayi
 The Chief Minister was inaugurating crores of schemes in the police line when 100 Asha women reached
 mukhyamantri ko dekhte hi unka sabar tut gaya
 There is also an extent of hope towards the system
 vahaan pani nahin mila to kai aashaa mahilaayein behosh ho gayi
 Their demand was that women go to villages and bring women to the district hospital for delivery
 iske liye sau rupee pratidin milte hai
 It was repeatedly assured that it would be permanent, but still on temporary jobs
 bhatta badhaane kii maang bhi puri nahin hoti
 If you google, you will know that on May 12, the performance of Asha women of Uttarakhand is going to be performed
 kisi rajya main inhen paanch sau rupee prati din milte hai to kisi rajya main teen sau bhi
 The work is the same but if the government agrees, the demand will be heard
 meghalaya main 1000 rupaya pratidin mil rahaa he
 While their role is very important to improve your society
 kai baar lagata he ki loktantr ke liye sirf raajnneetik dal hi sangharsh kar rahe hai
 We will carefully observe that more than these groups struggle
 kahin skool kii fees ke khilaaf maa-baap binar liye chale ja rahe hai to kahin apni dihadi badhaane ke liye lathi khaake aa rahe hai
 a person from a political party may after two to four jail visits and dharna demonstrations, from Chief Minister to Prime Minister, but common people take great risks for these demonstrations
 naukari daanv par lag jaati he
 Insecurity increases further
 kuch log apane pradarshnon ko haasyaaspad rup bhi dete hai taaki camaron ke liye aakarshak ho jaae
 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it
 hamaare news room main kai jagahon se aisi feed aati rahati he
 Thousands of people give press releases in newspapers across the country that today, they demonstrated on such and such issue
 inamen apni naukari ko sthai karne se lekar paanch saal ke liye sthai rup se mukhyamantri bane netaa ji ke istife kii maang hoti he
 Some performances have great endurance
 unke saath koi dal nahin hota
 There is no media but the fight continues
 kya aapane kisi netaa ko inke haq main twit karte dekha he
 The rhyme type statements that make the headline come quickly but stand with the common people only when they benefit
 tippaniyan Listen to this story of Ludhiana
 ludhiana main abhibhavak manch 17 march se pradarshan kar rahaa he
 Their performance is going against the arbitrariness of schools in increasing fees
 in abhibhavakon ne upayukta se bhi mulaakaat kii he
 Demanded that he had formed a committee of fifteen members, now its decision be implemented
 disi ne privet skool ke logon se mulaakaat kii or kaha ki miljul kar iskaa samaadhaan nikaal liya jayega
 Now tell me one thing
 saare raajnneetik dal aam janata ke liye hi kasame khate hai to aise pradarshnon main ve kyon nahin shaamil hote hai
 Do political parties leave the public after the election
 ludhiana ke in abhibhavakon ne 5 april ko bhukh hadtaal bhi kii thi
 Their slogan is to get out of the houses, fight the unscrupulous ones
 log apane apane naare bhi garh rahe hai
 Stop it, stop it
 mummy papa na becho sone kii chudiyaan, parent association ko bataao majaburiyaan
 What is the matter
 
 
 salaam aap logon ko
 i know i am doing too much with you
 itnaa dharna-pradarshan dekhakar aap niraash ho sakate hai lekin yah bhi to dekhie ki in logon ne loktantr ko kis tarah se jinda rakhaa he
 One day you will also have to get on the road
 aap andaja laga sakate hai ki sarkarein vaaki kitni samvedansheel ho sakate hai
 If you have become very positive

 You may be disappointed to see so much protest, but also see how these people have kept democracy alive

 At times it seems that only political parties are fighting for democracy
 dhyaan se dekhenge ki unase kahin zyada yah samooh sangharsh karte hai
 Somewhere parents are carrying banners against school fees, and somewhere sticks are being drawn to increase their daily wages
 raajnneetik dal kaa vyakti to do-chaar jail yatraaen or dharna pradarshan karne ke baad ho saktaa he ki mukhyamantri se lekar pradhanmantri ban jaae lekin aam log in pradarshnon ke liye bade khatre uthaate hai
 The job is at stake
 asuraksha or bad jaati he
 Some even ridicule their performances so that they become attractive to the cameras
 madhyapradesh ke reva main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf anokhaa virodh-pradarshan dikhaa
 Unhappy with the administration's non-focus on complaints against continued corruption, Vishwanath Patel chose a unique path
 unhone plateform banaaya or use 60 foot gahare kuen main daalaa or utar gaye
 That is, they were neither on the ground nor on the sky and were expressing their opposition
 kabhi dekha he aisa virodh pradarshan
 She is alone but the courage is so strong that there is no need to wait for anyone else
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf khud hi nikal pade hai, bhale unhone jo rasta chunaa usase logon ko etraj ho saktaa he, lekin unki niyat par to nahin hi
 He had already informed the administration about his unique protest, but no one had taken it seriously at that time
 lekin jab bade adhikariyon ko vishwanath kii muhim kaa pataa chalaa, ve daude chale aae or phir unhen kisi tarah kuen se baahar aane ke liye manaaya gaya
 However, the authorities had to give written confidence to take action
 bina iske vishwanath baahar aane ko taiyaar nahin the
 Such feeds keep coming from many places in our newsroom
 desh bhar ke akhabaaron main hajaaron kii sankhya main log press relies de aate hai ki aaj falaan falaan maamle par pradarshan kiya
 These demand the resignation of the leader who has permanently become the Chief Minister for five years, from permanent employment
 kuch pradarshnon main to gajab kaa dhiraj hota he
 There is no party with them
 koi media nahin hota magar ladaai jari rahati he
 Have you seen any leader tweeting in favor of them? hedline banane vaali tukbandi tip ke bayaan to jhat se aa jate hai magar aam logon ke saath tabhi khadey hote hai jab inkaa phayda hota he

 There was a unique protest demonstration against corruption in Rewa, Madhya Pradesh
 lagaataar bhrashtachar ke khilaaf shikaayat par prashasan ke dhyaan na dene se naaraaz vishwanath patel ne anokhaa rasta chunaa
 He built the platform and dumped it into a 60-foot deep well and descended
 yani ve na jameen par the na aasmaan par or apana virodh jataa rahe the
 Have you ever seen such a protest akele hai lekin hausala itnaa buland he ki kisi or ke intjaar kii jarurat nahin
 People have come out against corruption on their own, even if the path they chose, people may have objections, but not on their intention
 unhone apane anokhe virodh pradarshan kii jaankaree pehle hi prashasan ko di thi, lekin us vakt kisi ne shaayad gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But when the top officials came to know about Vishwanath's campaign, they came running and then somehow persuaded him to come out of the well
 haalaaki adhikariyon ko karrwai karne kaa likhit bharosa dena padaa
 Vishwanath was not ready to come out without it

 US President Donald Trump signed a government order prohibiting the separation of migrant families on the border
 trump ne hastakshar karne ke baad kaha ki yah aadesh pariwaron ko ek saath rakhane ke bare main he
 i do not like the separation of families
 bataa den ki trump ke pravasi pariwaron ko alag karne ke vivaadit faisle kii duniyabar main kaaphi aalochana hui thi, jiske baad unhone ye kadam uthaaya
 Trump's wife and America's first woman, Melania Trump, criticized this policy
 aisa bahut kam dekha jaataa he jab melania is tarah ke nitigat muddon par apni raay jaahir karti hon, lekin unhen yah niti unhen is kadar khatki ki apni pravaktaa ke jariye unhone kaha ki, bacchon ko unke pariwaron se alag hote dekhne se unhen nafrat he
 Explain that Trump's policy is on the issue of separation of migrant mothers and their children on the US border

 is mudde par america main bahes us vakt tej ho gai jab mata-pita se algaav jhel rahe bacchon kii tasviren or kahaniyaan logon ke saamne ain, jisaki upaj trump kii vivaadit avrajan niti ko bataaya gaya
 Explain that the Trump administration adopted an immigration policy of zero tolerance at the border on illegal migrants, under which every adult who entered the US illegally was sent to jail after filing a case of federal crimes and the children were separated from them in custody
 Used to be sent to the center

 Sardar Patel's dream fulfilled by removing 370 of PM Modi's address on Unity Day: PM 'resolves Kashmir issue with Sardar' Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday paid tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on the occasion of National Unity Day
 kevadia main stachu of unity ke paas piem modi ne sambodhan kiya or kaha ki anuchhed 370 ke hatane se hamaari sarkaar ne sardaar patel ko sachhee shradhanjali di he
 During this time, the Prime Minister spoke openly on the new Jammu and Kashmir and said that it was not just to draw a streak on the ground
 rashtriya ekta diwas ke maukey par piem modi ne jammu-kashmir ke masale par kya bolaa, yahaan padhein
 
 
 Article 370 had built a temporary wall, which promoted separatism in Kashmir
 piem ne kaha ki aaj sardaar sahab ko main hisaab de rahaa hum, sardaar sahab aapkaa jo sapana adhuraa tha wo diwaar dhaha di gai he
 Sardar Patel had once said that if he had the issue of Kashmir with him, it would not take long to resolve it
 PM: hamen is baat kii bhi khushi he ki aaj se hi jammu-kashmir or ladakh, ek nae bhavishya kii ore kadam badha rahe hai
 Recently there, the participation of 98 percent of panch-sarpanchs in the election of Block Development Council is a big message
 — PMO India (@pmoindia)october 31, 2019- ghati main aatankwaad ne 40 hajaar logon kii jaan le lee, 370 se kashmir ko sirf aatankwaad mila tha
 There was Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir all over the country and terrorism was spreading only there
 - desh kii sansad ne 5 agast ko faisla lekarsardaar sahab ko shradhanjali di
 Since today, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are moving towards a new history
 ab kshetra ke aadhaar par shikaayatein khatm hongi or kashmir main vikaas ke nae yug kaa aarambh hoga
 - There will no longer be a game of toppling the government in Jammu and Kashmir and political stability will come
 vahaan par nai vyavastha sirf jameen par lakeer khinchne ke liye nahin he, balki vishwaas kii kadi banane ke liye sarthak prarambh he

 - isi kii kaamana sardaar patel ne kii thi, ham desh kii ekta par hone vaale har hamale ko munhtod jawaab denge
 Efforts to break the unity of the country will not be endured
 - aaj se jammu-kashmir or ladakh ke sabhi sarkari karmchaariyon ko saatven vetan ayog dwaara sweekrut bhatton kaa laabh milanaa bhi shuru ho jayega

 He said that it should be discussed whether it has made any difference or not

 unka maananaa tha ki itane varshon main pichhadon ko barabari mil jaaegi, lekin aaj 65 saal baad bhi unki haalat jas kii tas he
 The current political system is responsible for the current system of reservation
 har 10 saal baad jabriserveshnaki time limit badhaane kaa jab bhi prapojal aata he to sabhi political parties ke leader iskaa saport karne lagate hai
 Only the time limit of reservation is increased repeatedly
 'sumitra mahajan ne aage kaha ki pichde logon ke liye hamane kuch nahin kiya or vah bhi isaki doshi hai
 Mahajan said, 'I believe it should be reviewed
 ham pichley 60-70 saal main bhi desh se jatvaad ko khatm nahin kar paae hai
 We should think why we were not able to create a society of Ambedkar's dreams even after so many years

 isi tarah bhaajapa hindutv or basapa daliton ke naam par raajnneeti karti he
 God knows how many Hindus and Dalits did it
 inase bhale to wo bache-khuche vampanthi hi, jo aaj tak rus kii kranti or ‘che’ ko yadakar sadak par to bain ore se chalate hai
 When everyone had taken up the issue of their respective parts, a new party came out of the U-turn of the movements, called 'aa Aa Pa', the name of 'aam Aadmi' became easy
 Problems and complaints never end, so they decided that they will do politics in the name of common man
 raajnneeti main raajnneeti bhi usee ke bhale ke naam par kii jaati he, jise aap sabase aasaani se budhu bana len
 After the occupation of the common man's brand, it was necessary to look common, due to which strange entries of sewing oversize shirts started coming to the middle entries
 fate sweater martabaanon ke badale na bechakar phir dhokar pahan liye gaye
 Slippers replaced shoes
 unchaas dinia hip ke baad jab aam pakakar tapak gaye, to samasya ‘asal aam aadmi’ ke saath shuru hui
 AK left the 'common man' of RK Laxman politicized
 ab koi majaburi bayaan karte hue bhi kah de 'bhaiya main to aam aadmi hum' to aglaa taang khinchate hue kahata, mafalar nahin dikh rahaa tumhaara, or tumhen to khaansee bhi nahin he'
 So when everyone is wearing a double XL size shirt, Reebok's shoe under white kurtas and a half-sleeve kurta on a fifty-six inch chest to show themselves in common, then how to identify the common man? From cap, to broom, to muffler? So the answer is from his habits
 bina topi vaale aam aadmi ko aap uski aadaton se ek baar main pahchaan sakate hai
 Finding and recognizing the common man engaged in saving and juggling every moment is not a big task
 wo har vaqt bagal vaale bas stop par khadaa hota he
 Start by eating and drinking, if the common man likes Kulfi, but ask for ice cream, then he will tell the favorite 'vanila'
 chokobar khaakar uski tandi rakh letaa he, jisase ghar main kulfi jamaa sake
 Colddrink also keeps the bottle after drinking, in which water can be drunk for later months
 machharmaar agarbatti ko kachua kahkar bulaata he or wo bhi aadhi todakar tab jalaata he, jab machhar zyada ho jaaen
 Shopping for more than shopping for merchandise gives him money in the end
 pitja pack karaane ke baad mili extra sos ke packet ko sambhalakar rakh letaa he
 The sauce bottle at home may run for two months, but the restaurant intentionally puts more sauce on the plate
 kai baar to sirf isliye sabji mandi raat main der se jaataa he, taaki sabjeewala ghar jane kii jaldi main sabji sasti de jaae
 And it is not necessary that only the man taking responsibility of the family should see the budget
 aaj kaa yuva ho, to wo bhi har baar alag brand kaa dio laata he, can ko sambhalakar rakhata he, taaki ghar aane waalon ko dikhaa sake ki uske paas kitne alag-alag dio hai
 Many videos do not download on whatsapp simply because they are more megabytes
 maheene main ek bada net pack dalwane kii bajaay hafte-hafte kar chaar chote net pack dalaata, taaki har dfa das rupee kaa muft tocktime alag se mil sake
 Even if you cannot recognize the common man, then stand at the grocery store
 aam aadmi chaay pattee bhi vahi le jayega, jisamen har packet ke saath muft cap-gilaas yaa plate milti ho
 It is not stingy
 ye apane sansadhano ke saath tike rahane kii jaddojahad he
 The day the real Aam Aadmi Party is not built, it will be named, 'extremely Aam Aadmi Party'

 He said that Article 370 was an issue of the erstwhile Jana Sangh and after the formation of the BJP, it has also been its issue

 He listened carefully to me and assured me of a solution to the problem

 baithak ke baad rahul ne bhadar blaak main euko bank kii ek shakha kaa udghaatan kiya
 The US President was cautious this time
 unhone sidhe taur par bharat main kharaab hote nivesh ke vaataavaran kii aalochana nahin kii, isaki bajaae ve america kaarobaari samudaay ke sadasyon kii baat ko rakh rahe the
 He particularly criticized the finer things like ban on foreign direct investment in retail
 lekin duusare kii baat ko uddhrut karne or jas kaa tas duhara dene main bahut baarik fark hota he
 Barack Obama wants India to open up its economy
 aakhir kyon? shaayad isliye kyonki udaarikaran growth main sahaayak hota he, isse rojgaar badhata he, garibi ghatati he, jaisaa ki unhone apane intervyuu ke baad vaale hisse main bataaya he
 Obviously, liberal economists have the same opinion and there can be no difference of opinion on whether there is a cross-border movement of goods, services, capital and labor
 vah yah daleel bhi degaa ki sangrakshan ke kaaran aksham gharelu utpaadakon ko phayda hota he or kanjumar ko nuksaan
 But this argument would have allowed us to agree if it was coming from a country which had implemented it itself
 udhaaharan samet bataaya ja saktaa he ki maal, seva, puunji or shram chaaron ke maamle main america adarsh nahin he
 Former US President Ulysses Grant said, "england has been dependent on patronage for centuries, taking this policy to the extent of extremism and giving it satisfactory benefits
" do sadi baad england ko laga ki mukt vyapaar ko apnaanaa zyada sahaj hoga kyonki use ab lagata he ki sangrakshan se kuch hasil nahin hone vaala
 My understanding of our country says that within 200 years, America will also come out of the policy of conservation and will adopt free trade
 '' iske varshon baad yuddh ke dinon main smut-holly tarriff aayaa
 Documents are also available in the US at the expense of such protection
 aisa lagata he ki obama apane mitra manmohan singh ko yah bataanaa chaah rahe the ki unhen america kii ateet main kii gai galatiyon se sabak lenaa chahie
 According to the book written by the Indian Prime Minister on India's exports in 1964, he was probably sympathetic to the price of protection being paid by the developed countries to the developed countries
 badakismati se maal, seva, puunji or shram ke chaaron morchon par america galtiyaan abhi itihaas kaa hissaa nahin bani hai or iske paksh main anginat udhaaharan ginaae ja sakate hai
 What does the US think about the goods category moving from steel and agriculture, or from duty to non-tariff barriers, anti-dumping duty, countervailing (anti-subsidy) fee, export subsidy and environment? In the case of similar service and capital, what would the US say on liberalization in FDI standards in American domestic aviation? In the case of labor, take liberalization of immigration provisions and make visa qualifications flexible
 obama kah sakate hai ki yah sab unhen viraasat main mila tha or ve sangrakshanvaad ko peeche dhakavlane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 But this thing is not digested for two reasons
 pehali, raashtrapati banane se pehle obama kaa voting record dekhen to ve bamushkil mukt vyapaar ke samarthak dikhte hai
 American protectionism has increased especially since 2007
 is maamle main china ke barakes sangrakshanvaad ko jane dijie (tair, saura panel, poltry, vinimay dar, ityadi)
 Broadly under such policies, the 2009 American Reconstruction and Recovery Act (and related provisions), also known as the Bye American provision, National Export Initiative for Export Driven Employment Generation, American Clean Energy and Security Act, Employment American Workers Act, Dairy Export incentive programs and financial incentives to auto sector etc
 ye sirf udhaaharan hai, puraa sangrakshanvaad or vistrut he
 It is being said on this logic that India should liberalize itself, even though FDI in retail is only a small part of the whole scenario of economic reforms
 obama daleel de sakate hai ki america nitiyaan vishwa vyapaar sanghathan ke anukool hai
 At one level this argument is irrelevant
 pehali baat to yahi he ki udaarikaran kii clasical daleel kisi len-dein kii samanta par aadhaarit nahin hoti
 Unilateral liberalization gives benefits, but it takes time
 bharat bhale hi epadi par udaar ravaiya na apanaae lekin america ko to udaarikaran lagu karne kii jarurat he hi
 Secondly, if you talk about the WTO, then the deal in the agreements will also come through the 1984 GATT
 agar bharat ko badale main kuch mil hi nahin rahaa, to vah udaarikaran kaa rasta kyon chune? yah baat bhulani nahin chahie ki doha daur kii vaarta krishi kshetra ko udaarikrut na karne kii viksit deshon (america or europe) kii jid ke chalate hi ataki padi he
 Third, even when US policies were found to be in violation of the WTO, the US showed no intention of changing them
 jaraa suniye koun yah baat kah rahaa he, ''nahin, ham outsorcing se kamjor ho chuki arthvyavastha kaa rasta nahin pakadenge
 Jobs and profits reached across the sea No American company can escape its tax liability
 '' obama ne 2012 main state of da union abhibhaashan main yah baat kahi thi
 He had said, "I can go anywhere in the world to find a market for American products
" '' haa, iskaa matlab yah mat lagaaie ki america videshi vastuon ke liye apane bazaar bhi khol degaa
 This is what is said, but preaching is very efficient

 This was expressed by Rahul Gandhi during an election rally in Churu, Rajasthan
 rahul ne behad tikhe tevar, magar bhavuk andaaj main desh ke bheetar sampradayik maahaul bigaadane kii koshish karne waalon par hamalaa bolaa
 Rahul Gandhi attacked the BJP, accusing it of being a party that fights hindu-muslims among them for votes
 churu main raily main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki aaj ek bhai ko duusare bhai se ladaaya ja rahaa he
 BJP is fighting people of two sects for political gains
 unhone kaha ki upi ke mujffarnagar main mahaj siyaasi phaayde ke liye dange karwaae gaye

 baton hi baton main rahul gandhi ne yah khulaasa kiya ki satvant singh or beant singh unki daadi indira gandhi kii hatya tab diwali ke din hi grenade phenkakar karnaa chaahate the
 Rahul said that he had good friends with Satwant Singh and Beant Singh as a child
 in logon par unhen bharosa tha, jise un logon ne tod diya
 'therefore i am against BJP politics', he said,' anyone can get angry
 gussa jaanboojhkar logon main bharaa jaataa he
 Leaders do it
 nihit swaarth rakhane vaali party ise karti he
 And then the common man who is hurt by this has to carry this anger with him
 vah har jagah is gusse ke saath aata-jaataa rahata he
 That is why i am against BJP politics
 kyonki ve rajnatik phaayde ke liye unhen (logon ko) chot pahunchaate hai
 He told a public meeting that after his grandmother was killed he came to know that the killers Satwant Singh and Beant Singh wanted to throw a grenade on their grandmother on Deepawali
 us sabha main sikh samudaay ke log bhi the
 Gandhi said that it took him 10 to 15 years to clear his anger against Beant and Satwant Singh
 beant or satvant singh unki daadi indira gandhi ke angrakshak the
 Pointing towards the Sikhs sitting there, Gandhi said that the people of Punjab were angry at that time but now that anger has subsided
 'bhukh se paidaa hota he gussa'unhone kaha, ‘kuch maheene pehle punjab kaa ek vidhayak mere paas aayaa
 The conversation was going on
 jane se pehle usne mujhase kaha ki agar 20 saal pehle vah mujhase mila hota to usne meri hatya kar di hoti
 He said that he was full of anger at that time but now he can hug me
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘us gusse ko shant hone main varshon lagate hai lekin use bhadakaane main ek minute kaa vakt lagata he
 It takes a long time to remove that anger and create brotherhood
 ’ sampradayik hinsa ke kaaran logon ke ek hisse main gusse ko samaaj main abhaav ke kaaran rosh ke bade vishay se jodate hue congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha ki gussa na sirf logon kii hatya se paidaa hota he balki yah bhukh se bhi paidaa hota he
 Handing over the youth, Gandhi also promised to end quotaism in the political system, where only a small number of people run the system
 unhone kaha ki vah aisa usee tarah karenge jaise unke divangat pita rajeev gandhi ne telephone ke aavanton main kota pranali ko samaapt kiya tha
 Gandhi said, 'we have to change one more thing in the next 10 years and we have to do it with the youth
 hamaare desh kii sabase badi kami rajnatik vyavastha main he

 gandhi ne kaha ki congress adhikaron kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Taking recourse to the stories in his speech, he discussed in detail about the divide between rich and poor in the society and told the people that BJP only talks about roads whereas Congress-led UPA government has not only compared them to three Made more roads, but also gave employment, food security and land rights through laws like food security, MNREGA and land acquisition
 gandhi ne kaha, ‘jab koi mahila televijan dekhati he to vah amiron ko hawaii jahaaj, badi naukaaon or kaaron main dekhati he or duusari ore unke bachche bhukhe hai or ghar par bekaar baithe hai
 They ask what will happen to them
 ve kab hawaii jahaaj or pani ke jahaaj main baithenge
 'he said,' On the other hand, youth have their own pain
 ham garib, amir sabhi samudaayon or sabhi dharmon se jude logon ko saath laana chaahate hai
 We are not saying that only the poor live in India
 bina vyapaar or udyog ke desh pragati nahin kar saktaa
 We want there to be a partnership between the poor and the rich
 ’ gandhi ne kaha ki nai railway line bichaane or malwahak galiyara sthapit karne jaise kaaryon se desh main yuvaaon ke liye vinirmaan kshetra main nae raste khulenge
 Interacting with the women and youth at the rally, the Congress vice-president told them that his party has tried to alleviate their pain and anger and takes steps to create employment opportunities for crores of unemployed
 unhone kaha, ‘congress garibon kii or adhikaron kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 i want the country to remain united and fight together
 ’ unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kii raajnneeti ke kaaran desh kaa taana-bana kshatigrast hota he or log maare jate hai

 Abu Jindal is one of the prime accused in the Mumbai terror attack case and was allegedly in control as established by the Pakistani terrorist organization during a three-day bloody game in 2008 in Mumbai
 ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki abu jindal ek saal tak saudi adhikariyon kii hiraasat main rahaa
 During that time Pakistan increased diplomatic pressure as they felt that it could give information about the government elements involved in the 26 November attack
 malik ne kaha ki abu jindal ke alaava do anya bhartiya pakistan gaye the
 He said, 'we are surprised why he went to Pakistan
 yah ricard kaa maamla he
 The Pakistani leader did not clarify on what basis he was making this statement
 abu jindal kaa farji pakistani passport or pakistani naagarik hone kaa jaali pahchaan patr bhi uske kabje se baraamad kiya gaya tha
 Malik said that Pakistan is trying to find out whether non-government elements on both sides were acting at the behest of a third power
 unhone kaha, ‘aap is baat se waakif hai ki halaat ne khatarnaak mode le liya tha
 Both countries started deploying their troops along the border
 agar donon pakshon ke netaaon ne paripakvata na dikhaai hoti, to halaat bighad sakate the
 Malik said, "we have to forget that India and Pakistan are enemies
" ham kashmir mudde par mil rahe hai
 This is part of the overall conversation
 ham 26 november ko nahin bhul rahe hai
 i am not saying forget the incident
 main sirf itnaa kah rahaa hum ki shatruta kii bhaavana ko bhul jaaen

 The article challenged the Shiv Sena to break away from the alliance and mentioned the sacrifice made by the BJP in the several-year-old alliance of the two parties
 gauratlab he ki shivasena ke saansad sanjay raut ke 'nizaam' vaale bayaan ko lekar is lekh main un par nishaanaa saadhaa gaya he

 unako centre or rajya main mantralay mili hue hai, usee ‘nizaam’ kii madad se satta kaa sukh bhoga rahe hai or phir bhaajapa ko bura-bhala kehete hai

 'this article in the publication of BJP says,' If they feel so victimized by the 'nizam' then why not go out

 Raut recently said that bjp-led governments at the Center and in Maharashtra are worse than the Nizam's government

 behatar hoga ki 'nizaam' ke pita se talaak le liya jaae

 The Delhi High Court has ordered a judicial inquiry into the violence between police and lawyers in Tis Hazari Court
 is ghatana se sambandhit kai video hai
 There are many claims from lawyers and jawans
 bahut tarah kii baaten hai
 But one question has been lost in the midst of all this
 kya ek varisht ipies adhikari ke saath yon hinsa hui thi
 Was molested
 kya unki pistaul gaayab he? agar gaayab he to kya iske liye koi cese darj hua he, mahila ipies adhikari ne kyon nahin mukadmaa daayar kiya, tab bhi jab unke saath yah ghatana court ke parisar main hui thi
 The women were in an IPS uniform
 dilli police ke jawan kehete hai ki unke liye koi media aage nahin aata kyonki ek jawan ke pite jane ke video aane ke baad bhi kamishnar tak nahin bole
 On Tuesday, this complaint from the jawans would have gone away
 lekin isse kya javaanon kii sthiti behatar ho gai? unki maang thi union kii jo nahin puri hui
 Bar Council President Manan Kumar Mishra is also talking about the lawyer who killed constable Karan outside the Saket court, but will action be taken from the FIR? This will be a test case of the judicial system
 baharhaal ghaziabad police ke parijanon or shubhachintakon ne shaam ko candal march nikaala
 Thinking about why this is happening will provide many answers
 upi ke sipaahi naukari main yatnaa jhel rahe hai
 His salary is low
 hafton chuttee nahin milti he
 Months do not get discharged
 ghar se dur posting milti he
 In low wages, they have to bear the expenses of the house in two places
 kya ye sipaahi logon ke saath jyaadati nahin he
 The same situation is in Madhya Pradesh
 vahaan ke sipaahiyon ne bhi vetan vruddhi kii maang ko lekar pradarshan kiya tha
 Never go to the soldiers barrack and see the situation
 lagegaa ki inaki madad kii zarurat he
 If the working condition is not better, work will not be respected, then we will continue to expect betterment from the police, nothing will happen
 isliye javaanon ke saamne vakeelon ko shikaayat nahin kerani chahie
 Capable lawyers range from TV debates to ministerial positions
 puraa raajnneetik dal unase chalata he
 No soldier gets Rajya Sabha
 vakeelon ko rajya sabha milti he
 Even then, there is a great need to improve the working of lawyers in the districts
 ve dhoop main kaam karte hai
 Work soaked in rain
 kai jilon main vakeelon or police ke bich takaraav ke yahi kaaran hai
 There is no parking anywhere
 kahin baithne kii uchit vyavastha nahin he
 Till such time, when confrontation will not be better for lawyers, such conflicts will happen from time to time
 mangalvaar ko dilli police ke javaanon ke pradarshan ko vakil banaam police kii tarah pesh kiya gaya lekin aap thik se dekhen to javaanon kaa pradarshan apane vibhaag or afasaron ke khilaaf tha jo na javaanon ko aspataal main dekhne gaye or na unke liye koi twit kiya
 This frustration was his
 zarur vakil bhi yah baat kah sakate hai ki unke liye kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ne bhi koi twit nahin kiya
 It is also due to this that the lawyers are feeling lonely
 balki vakeelon ko maang kerani chahie ki media unke kaam karne kii jagah ko dikhaae ki ve kitne mushkil halaat main kaam kar rahe hai or wo bhi insaaf ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 But it is not right to relate this whole matter to the images of any profession
 2016 main patiala court me kuch vakeelon ne patrakaron par bhi hamalaa kiya tha
 Journalists have never said that all lawyers are bad
 duusari taraf is ghatana se vakeelon kii chhavi par koi asar nahin padaa
 Later, both sides forgot this thing
 chhaviyon kii chintaa hoti to vakil hi aage aate or patrakaron ke liye ladate
 Kanhaiya Kumar was killed in this attack
 is puure maamle main kanhaiya kumaar kumaar ke twit ko dekha janaa chahie
 Which shows that even after this incident, neither the image of the lawyers nor the police has been tarnished
 chhavi acchhee ho yaa buree he, vakeelon se behatar koun jaanata he ki adaalat main faisla tathyon ke aadhaar par hota he
 Not based on images
 javaanon kaa andolan ekadivasiy tha magar vakeelon kaa andolan kai dinon se chal rahaa he
 From Monday to Wednesday, the district courts of Delhi did not work
 vakil karnel singh kaa kahana he ki goli maarane vaale pulisavaalon ko giraftaar kiya jaae
 The Bar Council of India said that the lawyers end the strike and go to work
 baar council of india ne kaha tha ki ve saket court ke baahar police ke jawan ko maarane vaale vakeelon ke naam mangaayenge
 Whether that name has reached them, only they can tell
 dilli ke sabhi zila satr nyaayalayon ko nirdesh diya gaya he ki court ke adhikari tees hazari maamle main kisi tarah kaa video clip, text massej yaa tasviir soshal media yaa kisi se share nahin karenge
 Hearing on this issue was held in Delhi High Court
 is sunwaayee main dilli police kii taraf se vakil bhi pahunche
 It was a good thing
 dilli police ke panel par 250 se adhik panel he
 This relationship should be maintained, but for this, it is necessary that the investigation in the Tis Hazari case should be impartial, quick and the decision should also come quickly
 pradooshan ko lekar supreme court main jo bahes hui he, usase yahi pataa chalata he ki koi sarkaar is maamle main apana kaam nahin kar rahi he
 In front of the questions of Justice Arun Mishra and Justice Deepak Gupta, the condition of four Chief Secretaries had become such that they had forgotten their homework copy at home and were making excuses for stomach pain
 adaalat ne aaj kisaanon kaa paksh liya
 Made it clear that the problem of stubble is not the farmers but the responsibility of the state
 sarkaar dwaara fund kii daleel nahin sweekaar kii ja sakati he
 Punishing the farmers is not a solution
 unhen mul suvidhaayen or sansaadhaan muhaiyaa karana zaruri he
 Instead of helping him, he criticized the legal action and said that this would create a law and order situation
 garib kisaan aatmahatya karne par majaboor hoga
 He told the chief secretaries that you have to help the farmers
 adaalat ne aadesh diya he ki chote or seemaant kisaanon ko 7 dinon ke andar prati acre 100 rupee kii madad di jaae taaki ve paraali na jalaaen
 This is the order for the farmers of Punjab Haryana and UP
 isamen centre kaa hissaa kitna hoga, baad main tay hoga
 The court has also said that within three months, the Center should make a comprehensive plan to protect the interests of small and marginal farmers, which will be implemented across the country
 monitering cameti se kaha ki vah dekhe ki court ke in adeshon kaa paalan nahin hota
 Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Kumar Dev, Haryana Chief Secretary k a Arora, Punjab Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh and UP Chief Secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari can hardly forget this day
 ummid he adaalat kii yah sakhti is maamle main koi thos pahal karegi
 We will tell you, one by one, what happened to the chief secretary and what happened then
 punjab ke mukhyaschiv karan avatar singh ko bench ne aage bula liya
 Asked what you did for the whole year
 pataa chaa ki paraali jalane vaali he to pehle se taiyaari kyon nahin kii
 The Punjab Chief Secretary spoke of lack of funds and the court became angry
 kaha ki aap ek rajya sarkaar hai

 ' bijepi ke ek or sahyogi dal lokjanshkti party (algepi) ne modi sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai he
 The LJP has questioned the appointment of former Supreme Court judge AK Goel as chairman in the NGT
 algepi adhyaksh ramvilas paswan ke bete or saansad chiraag paswan ne sarkaar ko chetavanee dete hue kaha ki agar 9 agast se pehle hamaari baaten nahin suni gayi to dalit sena bhi daliton ke muddon ko lekar sadak par utar jaaegi
 He said that the dam of patience of Dalits is breaking
 aapako bataa den tidipi pehle hi andhra pradesh ko vishesh rajya ke darj kii maang ko lekar sarkaar se alag ho chuki he, to vahiin shivasena aksar sarkaar ke khilaaf kai muddon par aawaaj uthaati rahati he or haal hi main usne avishvaas prastaav par sarkaar kaa saath bhi chhod diya tha
 Paswan said that before August 9, the government should bring an ordinance on the SC-ST law, or amend the SC-ST bill in the same session of Parliament
 paswan ne kaha ki supreme court ke nyaayadhish e ke goyal dalit virdohi hai
 Let us tell you that AK Goyal gave the decision on SC-ST law
 paswan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne ritred hone ke baad neshnal green tribunel kaa chairman banaakar unhen puraskrit kiya he
 We demand that Goyal be removed immediately
 paswan ne kaha ki mujhe ummid he sarkaar is par jaldi hi koi faisalaa legi
 Ram Vilas Paswan is also among the group of ministers formed by the government regarding the SC-ST Act
 unka bhi mat he ki essi-asti adhyadesh laayaa janaa chahie
 The LJP MP said that i have full faith in the government and the Prime Minister

 Chirag Paswan's attitude before the Lok Sabha elections has increased the difficulties of the Modi government
 is masale ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii chintaa bad gai he
 The reason for this is that any move by the Modi government on this issue is not right, because the matter is still under consideration in the Supreme Court
 iske alaava eke goyal ko engiti chayarmen pad se hataane kii maang ko bhi maananaa modi sarkaar ke liye aasaan nahin he
 If the government does this, then the message will go that the government has taken such a decision under pressure from its constituents

 The problem of the government is that on the one hand, the Opposition is not leaving any chance to surround the government, on the other hand its partners from time to time also raise such issues and keep the government in the dock
 sutron ke mutabik anusuchit jati or janajati varg ke vibhinn sanghathanon or samoohon ke netao ke saath modi sarkaar ke varisht mantri baatcheet karenge

 Arvind Kejriwal had yesterday tweeted to dismiss the speculation released in the media that Kumar Vishwas is his younger brother and no one can separate the two
 lekincageriwal ke twit se ye maamla shantahone ke bajaay or bad gaya he kyonki ab tak kejariwal or kumaar vishwaas ke bich sabakuch thik na hone kii jo khabaren mahaj atakalon par aadhaarit thim, unpar is twit se ek tarah se muhar lag gai he
 Kejriwal, who was weakened by defeats in punjab-goa and Delhi, was said to be a contender for power in the Punjab assembly elections
 goa main bhi uske achche pradarshan kii ummid thi lekin vidhansabha chunaav ke jo nattejey aae unamem goa main party saaf ho gai vahiin punjab main bhi uske mahaj 20 vidhayak jeet paae
 As if that was not enough
 rajouri garden ke upachunaav main party ke ummidavaar kii jamaanat jabt ho gai jabaki emsidi chunaav main to party kii or bhi buree gat hui or teenon emsidi main milakar bhi wo 50 parshadon kaa aankada nahin chhu saki
 Kejriwal may have apologized to the public after the defeat, but the leaders of his own party are not in a mood to spare him
 kumaar vishwaas main dikh rahaa he kejariwal kaa vikalpabataya jaataa he ki aam aadmi party ke kai netaa kejariwal ko party or sarkaar par ecchhatra raaj karne dene ke mood main nahin hai
 After continuous defeats, voices are now being raised that different faces should be put forward for the functioning of the party and the government
 ye kuch-kuch ek vyakti-ek pad jaisi hi maang he lekin iske nishane par kejariwal hai
 It is said that many party leaders want Kejriwal to run the government of Delhi while the responsibility of running the party is given to another leader
 duusare netaa ke role ke liye sabase aage kumaar vishwaas kaa naam chal rahaa he
 Kapil Mishra claimed big change: Cabinet Minister Kapil Mishra in Delhi Government said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that those who have been responsible for repeated defeats should sit in the house
 kapil ne kumaar vishwaas ke video kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki kumaar ne kaaryakartaaon kii aawaaj ko manch diya he
 Pointing to a major change in the Aam Aadmi Party, he clearly said that the Ganga is about to come out of the Himalayas, a big change in the Aam Aadmi Party, a big change is going to happen
 kapil ne ye bhi kaha ki jinke chalate haar hui he unhen ab aaraam karnaa chahie
 This is the demand of all legislators
 kapil ne badlaav ko to sunishchit bataaya lekin ye nahin bataaya ki badlaav kis tarah kaa hoga
 However, it became clear in his statements that he is in favor of bringing home the important role and 'current' leadership in Kumar Vishwas's party
 kapil ke jawaab main amanatulla kaa varkapil mishra ne jahaan khulkar kumaar vishwaas kaa paksh liya to virdohi kheme kii ore se aap ke ek or vidhayak amanatulla saamne aae
 He even described Kumar Vishwas as an agent of BJP and said that he wants to replace Kejriwal and become the convenor himself
 haalanki amanatulla kaa bayaan saamne aate hi kejariwal ne kumaar vishwaas ko chota bhai bataane vaala twit kiya lekin party ab jis mode par pahunch gai he usase uskaa peeche lautnaa aasaan nahin lagata
 Kejriwal vs Kumar: You have become two tearful situations, that all the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party are becoming in favor of Kejriwal and Kumar Vishwas
 dilli kii vidhayak alka lamba ne kumaar vishwaas ke khilaaf bayaan dene ke liye amanatulla par karrwai kii maang kar di he
 At the same time, all AAP mlas from Punjab have come in support of Kumar Vishwas and have written a letter to Kejriwal and demanded action against Amanatullah
 kejariwal bhale hi kumaar vishwaas ko apana chota bhai bataa rahe hon lekin ye bhi sach he ki party main kejariwal ke baad sabase lokapriy or bheed jutau netaa hone ke baavjood kumaar vishwaas ko wo ahmiyat nahin mili jiske wo hakdaar the
 Kumar Vishwas was also alone in Amethi, during the Lok Sabha elections, Kumar Vishwas was in Amethi and Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi
 aap ke tamaam chote bade netaa kejariwal kaa prachaar karne varanasi to pahunche lekin amethi se sabane duuri banaae rakhi or kumaar vishwaas ko akele chhod diya
 The situation became such that Kumar Vishwas had to openly express his displeasure and then Kejriwal went to Amethi to campaign
 khud vishwaas ne chunaav ke baad ek intervyuu main tanj ksaa tha ki amethi main banaras kii tarah ghat or ghoomane ke liye hotel nahin the shaayad isiilie koi netaa vahiin nahin pahunchaa
 Two miscreants shot a man and looted Rs 10 lakh in a market in Delhi
 peedit shaks mandi ke ek aadhati ke yahaan kaam karata he
 People present at the scene admitted the injured to the hospital
 police ne agyaat badmaashon ke khilaaf cese darj kar unki talash shuru kar di he
 The matter is related to Azadpur Mandi in Delhi
 beete din, goli chalane kii aawaaj se mandi main hadakamp much gaya
 In fact, 25-year-old Anil works for many years in Mandi itself
 ghatana ke samay aadhati ne anil se uski gaadi main rakhe bag ko laane ke liye kaha tha
 About 10 lakh rupees were present in that bag
 anil apane maalik kii wagonar gaadi ke paas pahunchaa
 As Anil took out the bag, two miscreants riding the bike, looking for a chance, came in front of him
 jiske baad ek badmaash ne anil ko goli maar di, jabaki duusare badmaash ne usase rupayon se bharaa bag chin liya
 Both the crooks escaped as soon as this incident was carried out
 dindahaade hui ghatana se puri mandi main hadakamp much gaya
 The people present at the scene admitted Anil to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital
 lekin haalat zyada gambhir hone kii vajah se use fortis aspataal main refer kar diya gaya
 The bullet is in Anil's stomach
 philhal uskaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 According to the police, police reached the scene as soon as this information was received
 is vaardaat ko dekhakar lagata he ki luteron ko pehle se hi paise ke bare main jaankaree thi
 Police have registered a case against unknown people
 ab aropiyon kii talash kii ja rahi he
 The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) has started clamping down on the former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti amidst the political furore over sections 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir
 asibi ne mahabuuba mufti se jammu or kashmir bank main niyuktiyon ko lekar unase sawaal-jawaab kiya he
 In a letter issued by the acp's SSP on 3 August, Mehbooba Mufti has been told that 'the investigation in the firs has shown that some ministers recommended the chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Bank for appointments
 ' patr main aage likhaa gaya he, 'yah saaf karnaa jaruri he ki in niyuktiyon ke liye kya aapaki ore se maukhik yaa anya tareeke se hami bhari gai
 Mehbooba Mufti received this notice on Sunday
 duusari ore pidipi ne is notice par gahari naaraazgi jataai he or kaha he ki centre kii nitiyon kaa virodh karne ke kaaran unhen nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he
 Mehbooba Mufti also says that they are being pressured and charges of corruption are being deliberately framed
 khabaron ke mutabik, purv main jammu-kashmir sarkaar ke anya mantriyon ko bhi is babat notice chaspa kiya ja saktaa he
 In his career spanning more than 20 years, Sachin Tendulkar, who has scored many records including the most runs and most centuries in Tests and odis, has still not touched many batting records in Tests and first-class matches and some of them reach him
 Are almost out of
 tendulkar ne ravivaar ko centurian main dakshin africa ke khilaaf 50waan test shatak jadkar itihaas rachaa
 He is the first batsman in the world to complete his fifties
 ab vah antarrashtriya cricket main 100 shatak puure karne se keval chaar saikade dur hai
 The legendary batsman has a long list of records to name but Brian Lara's highest individual innings in Tests and first-class cricket, Jack Hobbs' first-class matches with the most centuries and runs, one test, one series, one day, one calendar year
 There are some records in most runs etc
 which are not recorded in the name of the king of records
 lara ne test maichon main naabad 400 or pratham shrenee maichon main naabad 501 ran banaaye hai jo vishwa ricard hai
 In contrast, Tendulkar has not been able to score a triple century even in first-class cricket
 unka sarvaadhik score naabad 248 ran he jo unhone banguldesh ke khilaaf banaaya tha
 While England's Hobbs has scored 199 centuries and more than 61 thousand runs in first class matches, Tendulkar is miles behind him in this record
 unke naam par keval 77 shatak or 23 hajaar se kuch adhik ran darj hai
 The highest number of runs in a single Test series has been scored by Dan Bradman (974 runs) while Gavaskar (774) from India has topped it
 tendulkar abhi tak kisi bhi shrinkhalaa main 500 ran tak nahin pahunche hai
 Bradman (309) has also scored the most runs in a day, while Tendulkar has never scored 200 runs in a day
 ek calendar varsh main sarvaadhik test ran kaa ricard haalanki is baar tendulkar kii jad main dikh rahaa he lekin iske liye unhen 26 disambar se durban main shuru hone vaale duusare test match main 246 ran banane honge
 Pakistan's Mohammad Yousuf scored 1788 runs in 2006 while Tendulkar has scored 1543 runs so far this year
 yusuf ke naam par ek calendar varsh main sarvaadhik nau shatak jamaane kaa bhi ricard he jabaki tendulkar is saal abhi tak saat shatak lagaakar riki ponting, viv richards or arvind disilva kii barabari kar chuke hai
 Not only this, Tendulkar is far behind Adam Gilchrist's 100 sixes in Tests
 master blaster ne abhi tak ricard 175 test main 62 chakke jade hai
 However, the record of most fours (more than 1871) is named after Tendulkar
 tendulkar abhi tak kisi ek maidan par 1000 ran nahin bana paye hai
 Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene holds the record for scoring the most runs on any one ground
 bharat kii taraf se keval gavaskar or vivies lakshmana hi yah uplabdhi hasil kar paye hai
 Tendulkar has been playing international cricket for the last 20 years, but the record for the longest career is also seen beyond his capacity
 tendulkar yadi agle das saal or khelte rahe hai to tab jaakar hi yah ricard unke naam ho paaegaa kyonki england ke wilfred rods kaa antarrashtriya karier 30 saal 315 din tak khinchaa tha

 pahari nadi kanher ufaan par he
 Alam is that about half of Darzan village adjoining the hilly terrain has lost road connectivity
 log apane gharon ko chhodkar beemaari se jaan bachaane nadi paar karke shahar aa rahe hai
 The worst condition is of Bhuti village
 yahaan log beemaari kii chapet main bhi hai
 In such a situation, their families are bringing the sick in the crates by crossing the river with the help of their shoulders
 yahaan ke jabera, saliwada, gogra or sela gaanv main baadh kaa zyada asar he
 It is a pity that the government staff has not yet reached to help them
 sarkaar baadh prabandhan kii taiyaariyon ko lekar bade-bade daawey karti he, lekin in daavon kii hakeekat kya he, yah sabake saamne he
 The people of the village say that people have to go through the water through the neck
 bachche maheene bhar skool nahin ja pate hai
 If someone falls ill, he has to cross the river loaded in the bed
 agar baadh kaa pani zyada ho, to phir kisi mariz ko le janaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 The administration is ignoring the problems of the villagers
 kisi ke haath main goli lagi to kisi kii taang main goli lagi he
 If someone is beheaded, then someone is lying on a stretcher
 pulisavaale khun se lathpath strechar lekar bhaag rahe hai
 Some are crying, some are mourning
 mahilaon or purushon donon ko goliyaan lagi hai
 All this has been seen in the massacre of Sonbhadra district
 uttar pradesh ke sonbhadra main buudhvaar ko jamini vivaad main 10 logon kii hatya kar di gai
 The Sonbhadra scandal is such a scandal, which is directly challenging the law and order of Uttar Pradesh
 sonbhadra main bekhauf dabangon ne din-dahaade jameen ke liye tabadatod goliyaan barasaai
 Riding on 32 tractors, 300 people entered the village and laid the dead bodies
 puure uttar pradesh main gangs of sonbhadra ne dehshat kaa maahaul paidaa kar diya
 This bloodshed in UP has shaken the entire state
 sawaal uthte hai ki aakhir sonbhadra main kyon tabadatod goliyaan chalin? kyon darjanon logon ko lahooluhaan kar diya gaya? ye sab kaise, kab or kyon hua? police kya kar rahi thi? yogi sarkaar kya kar rahi thi?philhal is sonbhadra narsanhaar main gram pradhan samet 11 namjad or 50 agyaat logon ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kiya gaya he
 The weapons used in the massacre have been recovered by the police
 haalanki goliyaan barasaane vaala gram pradhan abhi faraar he, jabaki gram pradhan ke bhattije samet 24 log giraftaar kiye ja chuke hai
 What is the matter? Actually, there was a firing in Moorthia village of Ghorawal police station area of sonbhadra on Wednesday for grabbing land
 gaanv ke bahari ilaake main saikadon bigha khet he jis par gaanv ke kuch log pushtaini taur par kheti karte aa rahe hai
 According to the villagers, a large part of this land is in the name of Pradhan
 gram pradhan yajyadutt ne ek iees adhikari se 100 bigha jameen kharidi thi
 Yagyadatta reached out to occupy this land in large numbers with his companions and tried to plow the land with tractors
 sthaneey graminon ne iskaa virodh kiya
 After this, the people of the village head opened fire at the villagers
 jisamen 10 logon kii maut ho gai, jabaki 23 log ghayal hue hai
 This incident, which has surrounded the Yogi government, is the most bloodshed incident in Uttar Pradesh in recent years

 Now the City Collector of Mumbai has ordered an inquiry into the derogatory statement made on the Prime Minister at Uddhav's rally
 hairaani kii baat to ye he ki jab manch se uddhav thakare garaj-garaj kar loktantr ko sharmasaar kar rahe the us vakt bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh rajnath singh bhi maujuud the
 But this process of throwing mud at the cost of democracy did not stop here

 The members of the crime branch who brought the accused faced protests on behalf of the members of the Kathua Bar Association

 In 1984, where a team of boys were shown ghosts tightening their grip, the same thing was done by a gang of girls in a fun-filled style
 film kii mjedaar baat yahi he ki isamen bhuton kaa kissa hote hue bhi yah daraati nahin he balki hansaati he or gudugadati hai
 Melissa mccarthy and Kristen Wigg are knowledgeable ghosts and also have great knowledge in this field
 phir ket mackinon or lesley jones ke saath milakar ve bhuton ke peeche pad jaati hai
 Then do they start chasing ghosts from every place where they get news of being

 vaise bhi feg isse pehle spi, da hit or bridsmed jaisi mahila kendrit filmein bana chuke hai, or unhone isi baat ko ghostbsters main bhi kaayam rakhaa he
 Overall, the film is full of fun despite the ghosts
 haalanki script thodi kamjor he
 But if you want to enjoy the film, then do not see it by associating it with the original 1984 film
