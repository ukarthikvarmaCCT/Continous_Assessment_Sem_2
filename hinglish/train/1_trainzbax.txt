 Will India really get consular access in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case
 ye sabase bada sawaal he, kyonki pakistan ke bheetar kaa sach yahi he ki kulbhushan jadhav ko rajanyik madad agar pakistan dene degaa to pakistan ke bheetar kii pole pattee duniya ke saamne aa jaaegi, or pakistan ke bheetar kaa sach aatank, sena or iesai se kaise judaa hua he iske liye chand ghatnaon ko yaad kar lijie

 26 july 2005 ko ek hi din main mumbai main 944 mimi pani baras gaya tha or shahar main jalanikasi kii charmarai vyavastha ke kaaran nichle ilaakon main bheeshan baadh aa gai thi
 About 1000 people lost their lives in this flood
 us vakt bhi mithi nadi charchaa main rahi thi
 The sweet river, which flows 15 km in length before joining the Arabian Sea in Mahim, has become just a dirty drain for the city of Mumbai
 buree tarah pradooshit hone se pehle mithi nadi samudr main jowar ke samay zyada pani ko apane andar samahit kar leti thi or shahar ke kai ilaakon main jalajmav ko rokatii thi
 But today, while it remains only a means of carrying the dirty water of the city, in the event of fever, the sweet river at times assumes the form of danger for the city
 jowar aane kii sthiti main jab isamen samudr kaa pani bharta he to kai ilaakon main iskaa ganda pani bhar jane kaa khatra paidaa ho jaataa he
 The comments haalanki is nadi ko saaf karne kii kai yojanaayen bani lekin puri tarah kamyaabi ab tak nahin mili he
 The BMC embarked on a cleanliness drive to prevent the floods of 26 July 2015
 2009 main puraskaar vijeta sangrakshanvid rajendra singh ne ek paryaavaran sangrakshan samooh kaa gathan kiya
 To save the dying sweet river, however, BMC has been able to complete only 60 percent of the work it should have done

 Virat Kohli looked uncomfortable on one occasion at the press conference held in Mumbai before Team India left for England for the Champions Trophy
 darasal, team india ke captain ko is dauraan ek sawaal kaa saamana bhi karnaa padaa jinka jawaab dete samay unke chehre par jhunjhalaahat ke bhav najar aae
 However, Kohli also responded impassively to other questions asked
 lekin bharat-pakistan ke hone vaale mukaable ko lekar puche gaye sawaal se unke chehre par jhunjhalaahat saaf dikh rahi thi
 Virat gave this answer on indo-pak
 Actually, a reporter asked Virat, 'keeping in mind the current developments, is it right to play a match against Pakistan
 ' is sawaal par viraat kohli ne jawaab diya ‘aapkaa is bare main kya sochna he
 The reporter replied that 'we would like to know your view on this
 ’ reporter kii is pratikriya par jawaab dete hue kohli ne kaha, 'is baat se koi fark nahin padataa kyonki aap pehle hi is bare main apni raay bana chuke hai'
 Although Kohli gave a very carefree and comfortable answer to the other questions asked, but the resentment on Virat's face was clear on the question asked about the india-pakistan match
 aapako bataa den ki champions trophy main team india ko apana pehla match pakistan ke khilaaf 4 june ko edbeston main khelnaa he
 Kohli said that his entire focus is on winning the match for Team India
 champions trophy 1 june se england main shuru hone ja rahi he
 Both the UPA and NDA governments have done little to protect data
 phir bhi is maheene ke shuruyaat main sie ke bare main nuksaan pahunchane vaale rajfash hone ke baad se hi congress or bhaajapa ke bich shah or maat kaa khel jari he

 yah ap soviet sangh main janme cambridge uniwarsity ke america vidwaan alexandra kogan ne banaaya tha
 Although this app was downloaded by only 2,70,000 Facebook users, it simultaneously captured the data of these users' Facebook friends and thus allowed the CA to grab all this data without permission
 fasebuk ne kogan ko, jo manovigyaan ke professor or global science research naam kii company ke maalik the, yah sara data academik maksadon ke liye jutaney diya tha, par bataaya jaataa he ki unhone ise sie ko bech diya
 Two newspaper reports claimed that the CA used this data to aid Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign and to gauge people's stance in projects like Breguit and the election in Kenya
 baili ke mutabik, is fasebuk data ne istemaal karne waalon kii manovaigyanik profile taiyaar karne main madad kii, baad main jiskaa istemaal unhen prabhavit karne ke liye kiya gaya
 It is said to have had a better effect on voters than traditional posters

 Channel 4 wrote in its article, "executives boast at the meetings, saying that CA and its parent company SCL have worked in more than two hundred elections worldwide, including Nigeria, Kenya, the Czech Republic, India and Argentina
" ''essiel ne hindustan sthit company ovlano bijness intelegence (obiai) ke saath haath milaayaa tha
 OBI claimed on its website (which no longer exists) that it had worked closely with BJP, Congress and JD (U)

 Another OBI director Avnish Rai claimed in a media interview that the CA had actually worked to sabotage the Congress election campaign

 At the time Xavier Doherty came on the field as Australia's last batsman to support Mitchell Starc, who missed a century in the first innings by scoring just one run, India had full expectation that they could now bat 3-0 very quickly
 This will give a chance to create a record of defeating the Kangaroos, but one by one, all these bowlers were defied by the two batsmen
 sachin tendulkar jaise part-time bowler samet koi bhi spin gendbaaj unki jodi ko nahin tod paaya, or kangaaroon kii pari ke 81 over puure hone ke baad captain dhoni ne nai gend lekar bhubaneshwar or ishanth sharma ko thama di
 When there was no profit from that either, Dhoni again gave the ball to Ashwin in place of Ishant after three overs, but in vain
 phir jab jadeja ne drinks ke baad dobaaraa gendbaaji shuru kii to bharat ko vah wicket mila, jiskaa unhen kaaphi der se intazaar tha

 No spin bowler, including a part-time bowler like Sachin Tendulkar, could break his pair, and after the Kangaroos innings had completed 81 overs, captain Dhoni took Bhuvneshwar and Ishant Sharma with a new ball
 jab usase bhi koi laabh na hua, to dhoni ne teen hi over ke baad ishanth kii jagah ball phir aswin ko de di, lekin vyarth
 Then when Jadeja started bowling again after the drinks, India got the wicket they had been waiting for a long time
 jadeja ne stark ko 35 ke nijee yoga par aswin ke haathon lapakwaakar kangaaroon ko aakhri jhatka diya

 filmphere ko die apane haalia intervyuu main unhone kaha, vah sahir ludhiaanvi or amrutha preetam kii byopic par banane ja rahi film main kaam nahin kar rahi hai
 Deepika told that she will work in Vishal Bhardwaj's film Sapna Didi after Padmavati
 isamen unke saath irfan khan honge
 Demanding to run the case of Rashtrasadh on Bhansali, the censor board said - if Deepika would have played Amrita Pritam, it would have been her and Bhansali's fourth film together
 isse pehle bhi actor-diarector kii is jodi ne ramlila, bajirao mastaani, padmavati main kaam kiya he
 Let me tell, Priyanka Chopra's role of Amrita Pritam was also offered
 lekin baat ban nahin pai
 Deepika will play the role of 80s gangster Rahima Khan in Vishal Bhardwaj's Sapna Didi
 jise pyaar se sapana didi kaha jaataa tha
 At the same time, Irrfan Khan will play the role of race Ibrahim in the film
 deepika itani khubasurat ki sari umr unke saath kaam kar saktaa hum: irfanin dinon deepika padmavati ke pramotion main vyast hai, jo ki 1 disambar ko cinemagharon main relies hogi
 Explain that the story of the film is based on historical background
 film ke content par shooting ke dauraan se hi vivaad he
 Deepika is playing the role of Rajput queen Padmavati in the film
 ranvir allaudin khilji to shahid raja ratan singh kaa role main najar aa rahe hai

 Shahir and Amrita saw each other in the crowd
 donon kii nigahen us bheed main aisi mili ki ve dil de baithe
 Despite the marriage, Amrita fell in love with Sahir
 kai logon ne ise ekatarfa pyaar kaha
 It is also said that the songs were written by Sahir in the love of Amrita Pritam

 In response to a question, he said that former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao believed that there should be a life in the Congress ahead of the (gandhi) family and it was against him
 baru ne kaha, main samajhataa hum ki narsingh raav kaa dilli main ek smarak hona chahie
 There was retaliation against him
 unhone kaha ki sonia gandhi 2004 main pradhanmantri nahin baniin, kyonki congress ke sahyogi dal kabhi unhen sweekaar nahin karte
 He therefore chose Manmohan Singh

 Like humans, there is a change in the nature of dogs
 In the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, people are disturbed by the increasing terror of stray dogs
 aae din aise dheron maamle saamne aa rahe hai jinamein kute logon par hamalaa kar dete hai
 In many cases even humans have died
 prashasan bhi kutton kii badhati sankhya ko kaabo karne main naakaam sabit ho rahe hai
 Aajtak in ne jab kutton ke swabhaav ko jaanane ke liye tathy jutaaye to kai dilachasp baaten saamne nikalakar ai hai
 Anindita Bhadra, working with the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (kolkata), said that there are many reasons why dogs change their nature
 unka kahana he ki kutton kaa swabhaav sthaan, samay or paristhiti ke hisaab se badalte hai
 Anindita Bhadra said that we have done research on the nature of stray and domesticated dogs
 isamen kai pahalu nikalakar saamne aae hai
 Firstly, pet dogs are raised differently than stray dogs, which also has an effect on their nature
 frontiers in ichology and evolushan jarnal main chhapi apni report main anindita bhadraa ne bataaya he ki aawaara kutton kaa saamana har din kai insaanon or jaanwaron se hota he
 Dogs usually live in their areas and identify with the humans living around them
 unhone bataaya ki hamane pashchim bengal main alag-alag jagahon ke 120 kutton par research kii
 In this we saw that the dogs that we gave food and behaved in a friendly way also changed their nature
 kute poonch hilaane lage or ekatak dekhne lage
 When we visited him a few days later, he started recognizing us
 vahiin, researchrs ne jab kuch kutton ko sandigdh lahaze main khaanaa diya to kuch kutton ne khaanaa nahin khaaya or ghurne lage
 While some dogs ate fast and showed no friendship towards humans
 kuch din baad jab researchrs dobaaraa us jagah par gaye to kutton ne naa to dum hilaai or naa hi unhone koi dosti dikhaai
 There is a change in the nature of dogs according to the region
 
 
 researchrs kaa yah bhi daawa he ki kutton kaa swabhaav ilaakon ke hisaab se badalata he
 Anindita Bhadra of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (kolkata) told that we have seen that dogs in urban areas become violent in places where they get less food and more number of dogs
 khaanaa naa milane ke kaaran bhukhe kute aksar hinsak ho jate hai
 In urban areas they usually get food from garbage or animal lovers
 saath hi insaanon ke bich rahane ke kaaran wo zyada hamalavar nahin hote hai
 While this is exactly the opposite in the outskirts of cities and rural areas
 kutton ko gramin ilaakon main khaanaa nahin miltaa he or wo insaanon se bhi dur rahete hai jis kaaran jab koi insaan inke aasapaas aata he to wo hamalavar ho jate hai
 Dogs are also violent during mating
 
 
 researchrs kaa kahana he ki kutton kaa jab prajnan kaal hota he us vakt bhi wo hinsak ho jate hai
 It has been observed that dogs usually become invaders to protect them during breeding and after having children
 kai deshon se zyada ho gai kutton kii aabaadi
 
 
 According to some scientists doing research on the life cycle of dogs, the number of dogs in the country has exceeded 60 million
 yah vruddhi pichley 10 se 15 varsh main hui he
 This figure is more than the population of many countries of the world and many states of India
 haalanki, sarkaar ke paas iske pukhta aankade nahin he
 Professor Abi Tamim Vanak, who is doing research on the nature and rabies of dogs with the Wellcome Trust / DBT India Alliance, said that there are crores of dogs in India
 sarkari vibhaagon ke paas inhen niyantrit karne ke niyam to hai, lekin wo kargar sabit nahin ho paa rahe hai
 This is the reason why the number of dogs in India is increasing and that is why their nature has also seen a change
 kutton kii taadaad badhane kii vajah se unhen khaane kii samasya paidaa hoti he
 This is why they have been seen to be violent

 main vaaki acting karnaa chaahati thi lekin jo iklauta jawaab mujhe miltaa tha wo hota tha- tum stant karo naa, tum acting kaise karogi? yahi log mujhase ye bhi kaha karte the ki tum kitni sundar ho

 kitaab:da ilisit hepiness of adar pipal (angreji)lekhak:manu josephprakashak:harper colinedishan:hard bound (kul panne: 352)keemat:499apane pehle hi noval 'syrius main' ke liye kai saare puraskaar jeetne vaale manu joseph kii yah duusari kitaab 'da ilisit hepiness of adar pipal' dark kamedi or trgidi se bharpoor ek manovaigyanik thriller he
 Deadly combination of comedy, tragedy, mystery and adventure is the hallmark of this novel
 is noval main bharpoor suspence he jo aapako apane saath baandhe rakhega or yahi vajah he ki yah meri pasandida kitabon main se ek ban gai he
 At the center of this novel written in the 1980s Madras background is Unni Chacko, who has died before the story begins
 17 saal kaa unni duniya ke prati apni samaj or sach kii talash ko cartoon banaakar jaahir karata he
 But one day he jumps from his building and commits suicide
 vah apane peeche na to koi suicide note chodta he or na hi kisi kareebi ko uske is kadam ke bare main kuch pataa hota he
 Three years after his death, his drunken and professionally unsuccessful journalist father takes a comic from him, after which he again begins to suggest the secret of his suicide
 uske dimag main har samay ek hi sawaal ghumta rahata he ki aakhir unni ne khud ko kyon maaraa
 As the novel progresses, readers become familiar with his life, his thoughts, his friends, the best cartoons he has made, and finally his death
 vahiin, unni kii maa mariammaa ko ek aisi mahila ke taur par dikhaaya gaya he jo apane bacchon se behad pyaar karti he
 But due to an accident in childhood, his behavior gets a bit strange
 vah akasar rasoi kii pili deevaaron se baat karti he or apni frestrishan nikaalati he
 Mariamma arranges for the ration of the house with the help of the church and in free time plans for the death of her husband, Osep Chacko
 unni kaa ek chota bhai bhi he, jiskaa naam he thoma
 Thomas is going through that age when every boy wants to grow up quickly and earn a lot of money
 vah bada ghar, badi gaadi or sundar si bivi ke sapane dekhtaa he
 Thomas's character is very funny and he loves Mithili, a Brahmin girl living in the neighborhood, who is older than him
 noval main jab bhi thoma kaa zikr aata he pathak hanse bina nahin rah sakate
 Author Manu Joseph has beautifully portrayed his character in the words of his friends, school teacher, neuroscientist doctor Iyengar, Maryamma, Thoma and Mithili
 unni jinda to nahin hai, lekin phir bhi pathak ko usase pyaar ho jaataa he
 One special thing of this novel is that Mannu Joseph has done a lot of research to explain the psychology of the mind
 haalanki yah kaabil-e-tarif he, lekin is vajah se kahani kai baar khinchi hui si lagati he
 There are many esoteric psychological things in the story, but small things matter more to me personally
 kahani ke dauraan ek baar osep chaako apane bete ke dost se miltaa he, jo use unni ke bare main bataanaa shuru karata he
 Then Osep thinks in his mind that he has to seek someone else's help to know his own son
 uskaa man apane bete ke liye machal uthta he
 He does not remember when he hugged his son
 lekin us vakt vah apane bete ko gale se lagaana chahta he, use choomanaa chahta he
 Ocep may appear throughout the novel as a non-responsible and carefree father, but here the reader feels sympathetic to him
 is noval main lekhak ne kerala kii khubsuurati or madras ke mohalle kii choti-badi baton ko bahut baariki se pesh kiya he
 There is so much life in each word that it seems as if everything is happening in front of you and you stand in a corner as a mute spectator
 baharhaal, aakhir main unni kii maut se pardaa uthta he
 You will be surprised to know the end of the story
 agar main apni baat karun to jab maine yah noval khatm kiya to unni kii maut kii vajah padhakar laga ki mujhe ek baar or yah noval padhanaa chahie

 In support of his point, Prasad cited a resolution passed in the 1998 All India Congress Committee brainstorm session

 ’prasad ne jor diya ki ‘jansankhya visphot ke khatre par desh main bahes kii zarurat he
 Now is the need of the hour that we take it seriously

 The accused Kishore hails from Bihar in Muzaffarpur and used to sell vegetables in the area
 vah peedit parivaar ke saath pichley 20 dinon se rah rahaa tha
 The body of the 26-year-old woman and her four-year-old son were found in a rented house, police said
 mahila kaa galaa kisi nukili cheez se kaat diya gaya tha or uskebete kaa shav pankhe se lataka hua tha
 During investigation, the police found that the teenager was the last person who came to the house

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh believes that due to the politics of vote bank, religious reservation and appeasement, the very existence of Muslim society in India is becoming a threat
 sangh ke mukhpatr panchajnya ke ek aalekh main is bare main aagaah karte hue kaha gaya ki jaise jaise mazahabi aarakshan kaa anupaat badhata jayega, vaise vaise aarakshan kaa laabh uthaane waalon kaa sammaan ghatata jayega
 When more people of a particular religion will be given more on the basis of reservation than the people of the majority society, no law will prevent social harmony and harmony from happening

 jab tak hindutv ke vishaal evam sarvasparshi drushtikon vaala vaicharik rashtriya aadhaar surakshit rahegaa, yah swatantraaa bhi jivit rahegi
 The condition is that these religions and castes give up their desire to clash with the mainstream of the nation under the guise of the many facilities given to them
 musalamaanon se isamen kaha gaya he, ‘saubhaahgya se vartmaan samay main ho rahe rashtriya jaagran ne muslim bhaaiyon ko aisa avasar pradaan kiya he ki ve ateet kii bhuulon kaa parimarjan kar saken

 He is imposing them on the strength of the sword from foreign attackers
 hamaare muslim bhaaiyon ko raashtra evam swayan apane hit main in sachchaaiyon ko samajhakar raashtra nirmaan main apana yogadan karnaa chahie
 'the mouthpiece of the Sangh has further stated in this edict, that by understanding the signs of the nation-wide national renaissance happening in the present, most of the leaders of Indian Muslim society are beginning to understand that now Hindu society is no longer weak, powerless and unorganized
 musalamaanon ko apane mazahab ko nai paristhitiyon or bharat ke sandarbh main dhaalnaa chahie
 Referring to the backwardness of Muslims, the article said that the so-called secularist parties like the opportunistic Congress, which keep Muslim society as a special political herd for the sake of vote bank, are responsible for the perceived poverty and backwardness of Muslims
 is sandarbh main congress adhyaksh ko nishaanaa banaate hue kaha gaya he ki bharat ke saanskrithik rashtrawaad arthath hindutv ko tukdon main baant dene ke videshi shadyantron ko aaj kii sonia gandhi nidershit dow

 This sentiment prepares us to help other countries, whether it is to expand the International Solar Alliance, or to come forward to cooperate first in times of natural disasters
 tippaniyan We have achieved a lot as a nation, but the effort to do more than that, and the effort to do better, and to do faster, must be continuous
 ye isliye bhi mahatvapurn he kyonki varsh 2022 main desh apni swatantraaa ke 75wein saal kaa parv manaa rahaa hoga
 We have to keep in mind that through our efforts, the doors of new possibilities and new opportunities open up for the person standing in the last line of society, and also for that last daughter of poor family

 It should also include a system that provides speedy justice at all levels of justice, at a rapid pace
 is desh ke naagarik hi hamaari urja kaa mul strot hai
 i am fully confident that in order to serve the nation, i will continue to receive such strength from these people
 hamen teji se viksit hone vaali ek majboot arthvyavastha, ek shikshit, naitik or saajha samudaay, samaan mulyon vaale or samaan avasar dene vaale samaaj kaa nirmaan karnaa hoga
 a society which was conceived by Mahatma Gandhi and Deen Dayal Upadhyay
 ye hamaare maanviya mulyon ke liye bhi mahatvapurn he
 This will be the India of our dreams
 ek aisa bharat, jo sabhi ko samaan avasar sunishchit karegaa
 Such India will be the India of the 21st century
 VIDEO : ramnath kovind kaa shapath grahan samaaroh wo patibaddh locasevak jo puri nishtha ke saath apana karttavya nibhaa rahe hai, kahin pani se bhari sadak par trephic ko niyantrit kar rahe hai, kahin kisi kamare main baithkar filon par kaam kar rahe hai, ve raashtra nirmaataa hai
 Those teachers, who are selflessly giving direction to the youth, are deciding their future, they are nation builders
 wo anginat mahilaayein jo ghar par or baahar, tamaam daayitv nibhaane ke saath hi apane parivaar kii dekh-rekh kar rahi hai, apane bacchon ko desh kaa adarsh naagarik bana rahi hai, ve raashtra nirmaataa hai
 The citizens of the country choose their representatives from the Gram Panchayat to the Parliament, expressing their faith and hope in those representatives
 nagarikon kii ummiido ko puraa karne ke liye yahi janpratinidhi apana jivan raashtra kii seva main lagaate hai
 But these efforts are not just for us
 sadiyon se bharat ne vasudaiv kutunbakam, yani puraa vishwa ek parivaar he, ke darshan par bharosa kiya he
 It would be appropriate that now this earth of Lord Buddha lead the world in establishing peace and balancing the environment
 aaj puure vishwa main bharat ke drushtikon kaa mahatva he
 The whole world is attracted towards Indian culture and Indian traditions
 vishwa samudaay antarrashtriya samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye hamaari taraf dekh rahaa he
 Be it terrorism, black money transactions or climate change

 desh ke naagarik gram panchayat se lekar sansad tak apane pratinidhi chunate hai, un pratinidhiyon main apni aasthaa or ummid jataate hai
 To fulfill the expectations of the citizens, these people's representatives spend their lives in the service of the nation
 lekin hamaare ye prayaas sirf hamaare liye hi nahin hai
 For centuries, India has relied on the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, that is, the whole world is one family
 ye uchit hoga ki ab bhagwaan buddha kii ye dharti, shanti kii sthapana or paryaavaran kaa santulan banane main vishwa kaa netritv karen
 Today, India's vision is important all over the world
 puraa vishwa bhartiya samskruti or bhartiya paramparaon kii taraf aakarshith he
 The world community is looking to us for solutions to international problems
 chaahe aatankwaad ho, kaledhan kaa len-dein ho yaa phir jalwaayu parivartan
 Our responsibilities in the global scenario have also gone global
 yahi bhav hamen, hamaare vaishvik parivaar se, videsh main rahane vaale mitron or sahyogiyon se, duniya ke alag-alag kshetron main rahakar apana yogadan de rahe pravasi bharatiyon se jodta ha
 
 yahi bhav hamen duusare deshon kii sahaayta ke liye tatpar karata he, chaahe wo antarrashtriya solar alliance kaa vistaar karnaa ho, yaa phir prakritik aapadaaon ke samay, sabase pehle sahyog ke liye aage aana ho
 The comments ek raashtra ke taur par hamane bahut kuch hasil kiya he, lekin isse bhi or adhik karne kaa prayaas, or behatar karne kaa prayaas, or teji se karne kaa prayaas, nirantar hote rahanaa chahie
 This is also important because in the year 2022, the country will be celebrating the 75th year of its independence
 hamen is baat kaa lagaataar dhyaan rakhana hoga ki hamaare prayaas se samaaj kii aakhri pankti main khadey us vyakti ke liye, or garib parivaar kii us aakhri beti ke liye bhi nai sambhaavnaaon or nae avasaron ke dwaar khulen
 Our efforts should reach the last house of the last village
 isamen nyaay pranali ke har str par, teji ke saath, kam kharch par nyaay dilaane vaali vyavastha ko bhi shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 The citizens of this country are the primary source of our energy
 main puri tarah aashwast hum ki raashtra kii seva ke liye, mujhe in logon se isi prakaar nirantar shakti milti rahegi
 We must build a fast-growing economy, an educated, ethical and shared community, a society with equal values and equal opportunities
 ek aisa samaaj jisaki kalpana mahatma gandhi or deen dayaal upaadhyaay ji ne kii thi
 It is also important for our human values
 ye hamaare sapanom kaa bharat hoga
 An India that will ensure equal opportunities for all
 aisa hi bharat, 21veen sadi kaa bharat hoga
 But these efforts are not just for us
