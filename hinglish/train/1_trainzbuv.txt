 " insaani rishton ke dard ko bayaan karata kahani sangrah ‘afarin’ man ko chhu gaya
 Aziz friend and young writer Alok Shrivastava is seen robbing the prophet-e-mohabbat through 'afreen'
 yun alok ne bhoge hue yatharth ko kuch is tarah pesh kiya he ki pathak khud ko ‘afarin’ ke paatro se judaa hua mahasoos karte hai
 Alok is a good ghazalgo
 isi rup main mashhoor bhi hai
 That is why there is poetry-like lyricality in the language of his stories
 yah kahaniyaan dili-jazbaat kaa ujala aainaa hai
 Alok resides his mother's memories with great vigor
 isiilie wo nari man ke bahut qareeb hai
 His story 'salakh' exposes the mentality of men denying the existence of unfortunate women
 to ‘falsafaa’ main ghar kii tahazeeb ko mushkil vaqt main bhi sanjoe rakhane kaa shabdachitr he
 Far from caste, the warmth of humanity makes light feel
 sangrah kii ‘ammaa’ kahani bahut maarmik he
 How the elders of the house thread their relationship into a thread
 vahiin unke na rahane par rishton ke taar-taar hone par dil kaa dard alok ek sher main samet dete hai –ghar main jhine rishte maine lakhon baar udhdate dekhe,chupake-chupake kar detii he, jane kab turapai ammaa
 The story makes 'afreen' think
 rishton ke soe dard ko phir ujagar kar detii he
 Only one sentence of the story throws up - "do not ask the above person to write my name for you in the next life and for all future lives
" ’’ kitna dard he
 This is the culmination of love that defeats the wound of many people
 yahi vijay he kahanikar kii ki pathak khud ko kahani ke paatr main jeevant paata he
 Renowned critic Namwar Singh has written the role of 'afreen' with great heart
 yah is baat kaa pramaan he ki alok ke lekhan par unke samakalinon kii hi nahin, unki agraj peedi kii bhi gahari nazar he
 The understanding of relationships, the amazing examination of human sensibilities and their communication in the heart certainly make Alok very special
 kahani ke saar ko apane kalevar main sanjoe, har kahani ke prarambh se pehle, sher likhane kii alok kii kala pathakon ko bahut pasand aegi
 Only the thing that touches the heart is able to stay close to the heart, of course 'afreen' will not only touch the heart of the readers but will also be close to it

 Raising a new storm in the BJP, Ram Jethmalani has strongly supported the introduction of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi as the bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections

 Jethmalani, a Rajya Sabha member, wrote in his two-page letter, "I don't think this election is difficult, i would like Narendra Modi, whose integrity and administrative capacity are unquestioned
 ’’ party ne pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa mudda philhal thande baste main daal rakhaa he kyonki is pad ke kai daavedaar hai

 He said, "actually a shadow cabinet should be presented with a clear resolve that one third of our cabinet will be of non-party people of their respective maharathis, whose integrity and scholarship will be unquestioned

 The party has put the issue of the prime ministerial candidate in abeyance at present because there are many contenders for this post
 modi ke paksh main jethmalani ne likhaa, ‘‘unhen dusht kuprachaar kaa shikaar banaaya gaya, jiskaa makasad unhen alpsankhyak virdohi sabit karnaa tha
 This is easy to remove without blemish

 '' yah puche jane par ki kya gadakari bhi pradhanmantri kii daud main hai, jethmalani ne kaha, ‘‘vyaktigat rup se main sochataa hum ki main modi ko pasand karuunga
 Going a step further in his series of suggestions, Jethmalani said that along with declaring Modi as the prime ministerial candidate, the party should also form its own shadow cabinet in advance
 unhone kaha, ‘‘darasal ek chaaya mantrimandal ko is spasht sankalp ke saath pesh kiya janaa chahie ki hamaare mantrimandal kaa ek tihaai hissaa apane apane kshetra ke mahaarathiyon ke gaiyr party logon kaa hoga, jinaki eemaandaaree or vidwata asandigdh hogi

 ’’ Pakistan is again exposed
 mumbai hamale main pakistan kii sajeesh phir beparda hui he
 Pakistan, who described the Mumbai attack as a non-state actor's act, seems to be stuck with the statement of a US MP this time
 america saansad gairi ecreman ne kaha he ki pakistan fouj mumbai hamale main pakade gaye ekmaatr jinda aatankwaadi kasaab ke gharavaalon ko dedh karod kaa muaavja dene vaali he
 Pakistan on the one hand has the passion to fight terrorism and on the other side is providing financial help to the enemies of India
 is baar pakistan ke khaufnak gemplan kaa khulaasa bharat ne nahin balki america saansad ne kiya he
 a case is going on against Kasab in Mumbai
 wo apana gunaah bhi kabool chukaa he or pakistan kii sajeesh ko beparda bhi kar chukaa he
 Although Kasab has changed his earnest number of times till now, but the evidence against him is very strong
 yahi vajah he ki pakistan lagaataar is baat se inkaar karata rahaa ki kasaab vahaan kaa nivasee he
 But, now US MP Gary Ackerman has made a sensational disclosure
 aisa khulaasa jiskaa jawaab dena pakistan ke liye mushkil ho jayega
 Gary Ackerman, chairman of the South Asia Affairs sub-committee in the House of Representatives, told the US Congress that there was no question of suspecting that the Pakistani army was going to compensate the families of the terrorists who attacked Mumbai
 ecreman kaa ye bayaan apane aap main behad sansanikhej he
 According to sources, the Pakistani army has given a compensation of Rs 1
5 crore to the families of the only surviving terrorist of 26 / 11, Kasab
 yahi nahin, uske gharavaalon ko har maheene bhi moti rakam di ja rahi he
 Obviously, the statement of the American MP cannot be dismissed as such
 chunki 9 / 11 ke baad aatankwaad ke khilaaf jang main pakistan america kaa ahm saathi he aise main agar america kaa koi jimmedaar saansad pakistan kii patibaddhta par ungali uthaa rahaa he to yakeenan isamen kahin-naa-kahin sachai he
 Though India has been constantly raising its finger on Pakistan's intentions and involvement of 26 / 11 across the border, but Ackerman's statement will surely help India expose Pakistan to the world
 paak fouj kaa muaavja sirf kasaab ke gharavaalon ko nahin milane ja rahaa balki 26 / 11 ke baaki 9 mujarimon ke gharavaalon ko bhi milane vaala he
 Arguably Ackerman's statement is sensational and raises big questions on Pakistan's intentions
 mumbai hamale main aadhikarik taur par kam se kam 173 log maare gaye the
 At first, Pakistan continued to deny its involvement in this attack
 lekin hamale ke baad jab pakistan main baithe aakaaon se mumbai par hamalaa karne vaale aatankwaadiyon kii baatcheet kaa khulaasa hua to saamne aayaa is khaufnak sajeesh main pakistani khufia agency iesai or paak fouj ke kuch logon ke naam
 However, Pakistan continued to defend itself
 sabooton kaa pulinda saunpane ke baavjood pakistan khud ko paak saaf kahata rahaa he
 But what will Pakistan give now? ab to america ke saansad ne uthaa die hai pakistan kii niyat par sawaal
 The chairman of the South Asia Affairs sub-committee in the House of Representatives, Gary Ackerman, told Parliament that Pakistan was compensating the families of the terrorists who attacked Mumbai
 paak fouj ne pehle to dason aatankiyon ke parijanon ko dedh-dedh karod rupee die or uske baad har maheene bhi unhen paise die ja rahe hai
 Ackerman made these sensational allegations while presenting his report about lashkar-e-taiba

 institute kii lambey samay se chali aa rahi samasyaayein chouhan kii or teen anya sadasyon—anagha ghaisas, narendra pathak or rahul sholapurkar kii institute kii sheersh sanstha apatiai socity main niyukti se kahin aage kii hai
 Pathak is the former chairman of the Maharashtra unit of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the RSS
 agast 2013 main pune main neshnal film archive of india main anand patavardhan kii documentry jai bhim commered ke pradarshan or kabir kala manch ke sangeet kaarykram ke baad abivipi ke sadsy apatiai ke chaatro ke saath bhid chuke hai
 "pathak was the head of ABVP in the state at that time and recently he said that we should teach a lesson," says Urs
 jaahir he, ham socity main aise sadsy ko nahin chaahate
 In January 2011, a group of experts, including eminent filmmakers like Saeed Mirza and Kundan Shah , made several recommendations in their interim report to revive FTII 
 usamen kaha gaya, ''faikalti, chaatro or staff ke saath hamaari baatcheet kaa mukhya bindu dosha dhundhna or doshaaropan karnaa rahaa
 One of the main points of controversy is that students have often been accused of staying at the institute for more than three years
 antarim report main kaha gaya, ''jhukne kii yah badi hui avadhi campus main jindagi kaa sthaayee tatv ban gai he
 "about 15 students of the 2008 batch are still there
" is vajah se hostel main bheed bad jaati he or camere, recording room or studio jaisi suvidhaon par bhi dabaav bad jaataa he
 "there was a time when two batches were working on two cameras," says Urs
 chaatro ko istemaal ke baad color karection mashin ke thanda hone ke liye ghanton intjaar karnaa padataa tha
 In the last 55 years, the institute has been on strike 39 times for various demands ranging from curriculum changes to infrastructural development
 apatiai ke diarector di
 J
 narayan kehete hai, ''hamaare yahaan campus main rachanaatmak or atyadhik vicharottejak log maujuud hai, jinke alag-alag masalon par alag-alag nazariye hai
 But the strike is completely undesirable because it ruins the academic program and spoils the atmosphere
 ''chaatr kehete hai ki paathyakram itnaa bada he ki zyaadaatar chaatr apane antim asinament teen saal main puure nahin kar pate
 The number of students has also increased due to rules for admission
 isse bhi uplabdh sansadhano par atirikt dabaav bad gaya he
 Since 2010, the number of students in each course at the institute has increased from 16 to 10 earlier
 purv chaatr 31 varshiya riju das kehete hai, ''nae paathyakram main project, workshop or gatividhiyon—sabake saath samjhauta kiya gaya he kyonki ve chaahate hai ki chaatr teen saal main apana course puraa kar len
 "not only the students, but the faculty is also facing difficulties
 rajathali kehete hai, ''faikalti ko bahut kam paisa miltaa he
 Most of them are on contract, for which there is no job security nor any incentive or help to move forward
 '' ek chaatr kaa kahana tha, ''hamen visiting visheshgyon kii workshop par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he kyonki sthaayee staff main pratibhashali logon kii kami he
 Members of the FTII Students' Union also mention procedural delays in purchasing the latest equipment
 urs kaa kahana he, ''ham celuloid se digital ke badlaav kii prakriya main hai
 The camera becomes useless within six months
 isliye upkarnon kii kharid ko tej kiya janaa chahie
 Narayan says that FTII has implemented several changes and the Academic Council has passed a new curriculum which will be implemented soon
 sarkaar 2012-2017 kii 12veen panchavarshiya yojana main buniyadi dhaanche or naveenatam upkarnon ke unnayan ke liye 80 karod ru

 Are set aside for non-plan expenses such as salaries and other expenses
 jo baat kai saare chaatro or purv chaatro ko sabase zyada khali he, vah soochna or prasaaran mantralay kaa yah anumaan he ki vah iity chaatr par kiye jane vaale 3
 5 lakhs
 ke kharch kii tulana main yahaan prayek chaatr par chaalu vittiya varsh main 12
 5 lakhs
 kharch karegaa
 On this, says Vidhu Vinod Chopra, a producer and director of two of India's biggest hits, 3 Idiots and PK, and graduate from FTII, "thank you very much, but we are returning all the money that the government spends on us
" main yah baat guarantee ke saath kah saktaa hum ki sarkaar film institute par uski tulana main bahut kam dhan kharch kar rahi he, jo film udyog use kamakar de rahaa he
 "chopra says that films are far ahead of profit
" cinema main 'desh kii vichaardhaara ko badalane' or 'darshakon ko sochane ke liye majaboor karne' kii takat he
 FTII has produced many renowned filmmakers and technicians, including filmmaker, FTII graduate and currently FTII Society member Rajkumar Hirani, Oscar-winning sound designer Rasul Pookutty, National Award-winning actor Rajkumar Rao and cinematographer-director Avinash Arun
 Whose Marathi film Killa won the Crystal Beer at the 2014 Burlinale festival and Mr

 "the film industry is not just 'bollywood'," says Raghavan
 desh bhar ke chaatr yahaan cinema seekhney aate hai
 This is a place that encourages people to experiment without the pressure of earning money
 ''campus ke sabase lokapriy adde—bargad kaa vishaal ped jise 'visdam tree' kaha jaataa he—ke neeche ek kancreet kaa sinpost hadtaal ke dinon kii sankhya kaa hisaab rakh rahaa he
 The students realize that their fight is going to be long and they are frozen for it
 chaatro kii sanstha kii sadsy 28 varshiya yashasvi mishra kahati hai, ''vaise to ham har vyakti kii vyaktigat rajnatik vichaardhaara kaa sammaan karte hai, lekin in logon ne chaatro main film nirmaan kaa kaushal daalane ke saath-saath shrashtravaadi bhavanaaen'' daalane kii bhi baat kahi he
 Their political commitments are coming to the fore
 ''chaatro ke samarthan main abhinetri pallavi joshi or filmkaar jaahnu barua pehle hi apatiai socity se istipha de chuke hai

 is press conference main piem ne narendra modi, pakistan, piem ummidavaar samet tamaam muddon par patrakaron ke sawaalon ke jawaab die
 Know the reaction of politicians at Prime Minister's press conference
 
 
 sanjay raut, shivasena pravaktrahmadabad ke raaston par katle aam kii baat piem ne kii he
 If Modi becomes PM, then the country will be ruined, so what is the nation in your tenure
 katl kii baat karen to aapke hi kaarykaal main abhi mujalpar nagar main kya hua
 What happened in the streets of Delhi after the assassination of Indira Gandhi
 ush bare main ab tak aapane jawaab nahin diya he
 The expectation was big, people from the pm's press conference
 lekin khoda pahaad niklaa chuhia
 It was a time pass press conference, nothing has come up
 piem ko na sarkaar main kaam bachaa he, na congress main, to desh kaa manoranjan ke liye ye kaam hua he
 Sitaram Yechury Is the Bole Congress not in a position to form the government again? isiilie hamane ek raajnneetik pukaar lagaai he taaki maujuuda aarthik policy ke bajaay vaikalpik policy saamne aae
 Apart from BJP and Congress, there was a chance of a third front
 sarkaar ke do satta centre nahin the, hameshaa gandhi parivaar main hi satta rahi
 The PM and the Speaker were often separated
 sharad yadav, jediuek tarah se, unke bolne se kuch nahin hota, log mahasoos nahin karte
 When people feel
 log niyat pahachaanate hai
 Therefore, the situation has happened during Manmohan's tenure, the country has gone backward
 jo aarajneeti aaj ho rahi he, vah bhi desh ko peeche le jaaegi
 Both economic inequality and social inequality will not work together, they will not work
 is par unki koiu raay nahin ai
 He could not say anything to the poor people
 garibon kii jindagi dilli main kuch elaan kar nahin badal sakate
 His words do not match the people of the country
 main maanata hum ki narendra modi yaa rahul gandhi se desh nahin banegaa
 Rajnath Singh, President, BJP i would like to say to him that Narendra Modi during his reign has made Gujarat State a model state in the matter of development
 uske liye yah kahana ki unke piem banane se desh barbaad ho jayega
 This is a ridiculous statement
 jo unhone kaha ki jis vyakti ke shasankaal main dange hue, usko piem nahin hona chahie
 Anything unfortunate that happened in 2002 should not have happened
 magar esaiti ne jab clinit de di he
 To blame even after that
 main isaki ninda karata hum
 He said that everyone developed
 ye galat bayani he
 Other claims from the Human Development Index to development are false
 aarthik bhedbhaav or vishmata teji se badi hai
 There have been two power centers during his government
 isse kabhi bhi achche kaamon kii apeksha kii hi nahin ja sakati thi
 The government did not have the freedom to decide
 aaazaad bharat ke itihaas main kisi bhi sarkaar par bhrashtachar ke itane aarope nahin lage, jitne unki sarkaar par
 Arvind Kejriwal, Chief Minister, Delhi It is not important for the people of this country that who becomes Rahul, Modi or Manmohan becomes Prime Minister
 is desh kii janata mahangaai se pisi he
 Price of cylinder increased by Rs 220
 un chizon kii baat hi nahin hoti
 All day long it happens that he becomes the Prime Minister, he becomes the Prime Minister
 koi bhi pradhanmantri ban jaae, kya fark padataa he isse
 Farrukh Abdullah, National Conference, Farrukh Abdullah said, 'we regret that the Prime Minister has announced the retirement
 piem ne kisi dabaav main ye faisla nahin liya he balki aaraam karnaa chaahate hai isliye aisa kiya
 Rahul Gandhi's father was also the Prime Minister of the country and did a great job
 mechurity samay ke saath aati he or unamem bhi aa jaaegi
 Narendra Modi's becoming the Prime Minister of the country will be truly disastrous
 bijepi ko modi se behatar piem pad kaa ummidavaar chunanaa chahie tha
 ' desh ke share bazaaron main buudhvaar ko oochaal darj kiya gaya

 france main koi aisa shaasha aakar kahe ki hinduon ko nikaal denge, to hindu kahaan jayega? duniya main jayega kahaan wo, yaheen aayega or kahin nahin ja saktaa, yaheen aayega

 The family and supporters of Lok Nayak termed JP Nagar of Ballia as his real birthplace, calling the decision of the Central Government a step taken to benefit in the Bihar Assembly elections
 sampoorn kranti ke praneta rahe jaiprakash narayan kii bhatiji anju sinha ne kaha ki bihar ke lala kaa tolaa gaanv ko lokanayak kaa janmasthan ghoshit karke vahaan ek rashtriya smarak banavaane kaa centre sarkaar kaa faisla bilkul galat he

 Anju Sinha, the niece of Jayprakash Narayan, the pioneer of the entire revolution, said that the Central Government's decision to declare Lala Ka Tola village in Bihar as the birthplace of Loknayak and build a national memorial there is absolutely wrong
 unhone kaha ki baliya ke jepi nagar, jo purv sitabadiara gaanv kaa hissaa tha, hi narayan kaa janmasthan he or ise duniya ne mana he
 In 2001, Loknayak's birth centenary celebrations were held in JP Nagar, which was attended by many big political personalities including then Vice President Krishnakant, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani

 According to Jayaprakash Narayan's niece Anju, Lala's Tola is his ancestral village, but due to the plague in the village at the time of jp's birth, his mother moved to the part of the village of Sitabadiyara, now called JP Nagar
 jis sthaan par is vakt lokanayak jaiprakash narayan gaanv sthapit he, usee ke ek kamare main unka janm hua tha

 Chidambaram has said that maybe ten Pakistani terrorists who carried out the 26 November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai have been guided by an Indian but his identity has not yet been corrected
 chidambaram ne kaha, ‘‘jab ham kehete hai ki vah ek bhartiya ho saktaa he, to vah aisa koi vyakti ho saktaa he, jisane bhartiya lakshan hasil kiye hon
 He may have come to India intruding and stayed here long enough to learn Indian Hindi words, to learn Indian accent
 yaa ho saktaa he ki vah bharat se pakistan gaya ho, vahaan ugravadiyon ne use apane saath jod liya ho
 Refusing to speculate on the man's name, the home minister said investigators had long known that 26
 11 ke hamalon main ek shaks tha, jo ek bhartiya ho saktaa he
 Chidambaram told a private channel, "we know him from Abu Jindal and what we have known for many months
 lekin vah abu jindal nahin he
 It is not his real name
 ham kisi par ungali nahin rakh sakate, jab tak hamen aawaaj kaa namoona nahin mil jaataa

 ham main se zyaadaatar logon ne yah suna hoga ki apanepartnerase kisi baat par anban hona bahut swabhaavik he
 This has also been confirmed in the report of a new study
 study ke mutabik,partnerake saath kisi baat par hui bahes yaa jhagade serishtamajboot banataa he
 Let me tell you, during the study, about 1000 people were surveyed
 survey kii report main saamne aayaa ki jo couples kisi bhi baat ko lekar apane partner se jhagadate hai, ve un logon ke mukaable 10 guna zyadakhushrahate hai, jo partner kii kisi baat par bura maanakar akele hi rokar apane aansuon ko saaf kar lete hai
 The study's lead author, Joseph Grenny, believes that many couples avoid fighting with a partner on a sensitive topic, because they feel that doing so may cause them to suffer
 lekin, study main shaamil 5 main se 4 logon ne mana ki partner ke saath unka rishta kharaab hone kii ahm vajah kharaab communication he
 However, Grenny pointed out that the main reason for this is that many people do not understand their feelings properly as to how they should behave
 kharaab rishte kaa sara iljaam apane partner par laga dete hai
 This study shows that sharing your feelings with your partner and quarreling with the partner in case of something bad makes the relationship strong, not weak
 sirf rishte main vishwaas aurpyarhona chahie

 In this, the core agenda of the BJP was to leave the Ram temple in Ayodhya, Article 370 and the Uniform Civil Code very cleverly
 ye mudde bijepi ke saanskrithik rashtrawaad ke us agenda kaa ahm hissaa maane jate rahe hai jo sangh or jansangh kaa mul aadhaar rahaa he

 In this film, once again, tapes Kadravanraj will be seen opening, but the characters of this film, who are trying to discover the secret of these tapes, themselves will be seen to be a mystery
 trailor main bldi mairi kii mistry se bhi pardaa uthegaa
 The film will bring audiences to a paradise and a secret world of ghostly worlds
 'paranormal activity: da ghost diemension' oktober main 3di main relies hogi
 Watch the trailer of the film 'paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension': agar aapako lagata he ki pichley kuch saalon main board kii parikshaon main main 90 fisadi number laane waalon bacchon kii taadaad achaanak betahasha batch gayi he or iske peeche kuch gadabad he to aapkaa shaq bilkul sahi he
 The game is really happening behind the record numbers
 lekin agar kendra sarkaar kii chali to ye khel agle saal se khatm ho saktaa he
 This game of manipulating numbers is called spiking
 ab kendra sarkaar ke maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne iske liye sibiesai samet desh ke aath bords kaa ek varking group banaakar ise khatm karne kii disha main kaam shuru kar diya he
 Since education is a subject which comes in the concurrent list
 yani ise kendra or rajya sarkarein donon dekhati hai isliye kendra sarkaar is par ekatarfa faisla nahin kar saktaa he
 For this, it is necessary to reach a consensus with the states
 lekin desh bhar main kul 41 board hai or numberon ko manamaane dhang se badhaane kaa khel rokane ke liye sabase saath sahmati bananaa aasaan nahin hoga
 The number which any child actually gets after examining the exam is called Raw Marks i
e
 the real mark that student has achieved
 lekin jab rigelt ghoshit kiya jaataa he tab ye number nahin bataaya jaataa
 Before the result is declared, every board increases the numbers according to its own so that the result can be shown better
 tamaam board rigelt ghoshit karne se pehle numberon ko kai vajah se badhaate hai jisko Moderation policy kehete hai
 The first reason is to pass those students who are failing in a subject due to mere few numbers
 inhen aamtaur par kuch gres marks dekar paas kara diya jaataa he taaki kuch number kam hone kii vajah se unka puraa saal kharaab nahin ho
 The Board's Examination Committee decides by itself how much Grace Marks should be kept in which subject
 gres marks ko lekar koi vivaad nahin he or ye aage bhi jari rahegaa
 In addition to Grace Marks, the board sees how many complaints have been made about the subject in which the exam is difficult, or the question is unclear
 iske aadhaar par board kuch number tay karata he har student ke asli number main jod detaa he
 But these numbers are added to the marks of those students whose numbers are less than 95 percent
 aamtaur par ek hi pariksha ke liye sibiesai prashnptr ke teen set taiyaar karata he taaki agar kisi jagah par koi prashnpratra li ho jaataa he to pariksha radd karne ke bajaae duusare prashnptr se pariksha karaayi ja sake
 Many more boards do the same
 rigelt taiyaar karte samay is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki sabhi set ke prashnpratra se pariksha dene vaale students number ke maamle main barabari par rahen
 Therefore the set whose numbers are lower is again increased
 kendra sarkaar kii chintaa ye he ki ek duusare sebehatar rigeltdikhaane ke mukaable main board betahasha number badhaane ke mukaable main jute gayi hai
 The situation is that even the students, who bring 90 percent number at the time of admission, are also having difficulty in getting the subject of their choice in the college they want
 tamaam college or uniwarsity main pravesh pariksha ke bajaay marks ke aadhaar par hi admician hote hai
 That is why many boards are showing excessive leniency in giving numbers to their students
 khudsibiesai ke niyamon ke mutabik, rigelt taiyaar karte vakt is baat par bhi gaur karnaa he ki rigelt pichley saal ke mukaable kharaab nahin ho
 Due to this rule of moderation policy, the numbers are being increased indiscriminately
 sibiesai to isi saal se is niyam ko khatm karnaa chahta tha lekin dilli hai court ke aadesh ke baad ab ye agle saal se khatm kiya jayega
 On April 24 this year, a board meeting of the country was held in Delhi, in which it was broadly agreed that there is a need to curb the game of increasing the number
 ab sibiesai duusare bords ke saath baat karke iske liye sahmati banane kii koshish karegaa jiske liye varking group banaaya ja rahaa he

 # Bihar: Nine students dead, 24 injured after a vehicle rammed into a school building in Muzaffarpur— ANI (@ani)february 24, 2018 Uttar Pradesh Municipal Development Minister Azam Khan wants to quit the work and teach discipline to senior officers of the department
 ajam haalanki pichley dinon apana rosh yah kehake darsha chuke hai ki unke paas vibhaag ke varisht adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 This is the first time in the tenure of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's government when a senior cabinet minister has stopped watching departmental work, upset with the attitude of the officials
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki ajam khan ne dabaav kii ranneeti akhriyaar karte hue aisa kadam uthaaya he
 By taking this step, Azam has tried to send a message that he is not happy with the attitude of the top people in the government on Lucknow Municipal Commissioner MP Singh
 kuch dinon pehle hi ajam ne mukhyamantri awaas ke aasapaas safai na hone ko gambheertha se lete hue nagar ayukta empi singh ko nilambit karne ke liye mukhyamantri ko patr likhaa tha lekin unke patr par abhi tak koi karrwai nahin kii gai he
 Azam is sad that the government is not supporting him on the issue of action against the officials
 isiilie is baar unhone varisht adhikariyon ke khilaaf mukhyamantri ko patr likhane ke bajaay vibhageeya kaamkaaj hi chhod diya, taaki sarkaar par karrwai kaa dabaav bana sake
 It is worth mentioning that on Monday, angry with the absence of two senior officials in the meeting in the Municipal Development Department, Azam had dismissed the three-day meeting on the first day
 ajam ne kaha tha ki vah varisht adhikariyon kii laaparvaahee bardaasht nahin karenge
 Soon after Azam sacked the meeting, Samajwadi Party (SP) spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary had called a press conference and said that Azam Khan is the senior minister of the state and he must have taken a decision with some thought
 tippaniyan Chaudhary also advocated Azam saying that such negligence of officers would not be tolerated

 It is believed that Azam Khan has taken such a step by adopting a strategy of pressure
 yah kadam uthaa kar ajam ne yah sandesh dene kii koshish kii he ki vah lakhanu ke nagar ayukta empi singh prakaran par sarkaar main baithe sheersh logon ke ravaiye se khush nahin hai
 a few days ago, Azam wrote a letter to the Chief Minister to suspend Municipal Commissioner MP Singh, taking seriously the lack of cleanliness around the Chief Minister's residence, but no action has been taken on his letter yet
 ajam ko is baat kaa dukh he ki sarkaar adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai ke mudde par unka saath nahin de rahi he
 That is why, instead of writing a letter to the Chief Minister against senior officials this time, he left the departmental work, so that the government could be pressured into action
 ullekhneey he ki somvaar ko nagar vikaas vibhaag main baithak main do varisht adhikariyon ke na pahunchane se naaraaz ajam ne teen dinon tak chalane vaali baithak ko pehle hi din barkhaast kar diya tha
 Azam had said that he would not tolerate the negligence of senior officials
 ajam dwaara baithak ko barkhaast kiye jane ke turant baad hi samaajawaadee party (sapa) ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne baqayada samvaadadaata sammelan bulaakar kaha tha ki ajam khan soobe ke varisht mantri hai or unhone kuch soch samajhakar hi faisla liya hoga
 The comments choudhary ne bhi ajam kii vakaalat karte hue kaha tha ki adhikariyon kii is tarah kii laaparvaahee bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi

 log in desh main notebandi se haahaakaar machaa he
 Patna, the capital of Bihar, is also not untouched by this
 notebandi kaa asar beemaari kaa ilaaj karaane aae marijon par naa pade, iske liye mahavir mandir trust ne ek ahm faisla liya he
 It has been decided by the temple trust to provide financial assistance of up to Rs 5000 to the severely afflicted patients coming for treatment in hospitals associated with Patna Mahavir temple
 mahavir mandir trust ke pramukh acharya kishor kunal ne kaha kinotbandike baad utpann sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue mandir prabandhan kii ore se yah faisla liya gaya he
 Acharya Kishore Kunal said that keeping in view the situation arising after demonetisation, Mahavir Mandir Trust Committee will provide financial assistance of five thousand rupees to seriously ill patients coming for treatment in all hospitals operated by Mahavir Mandir
 iske baad marij ke ilaaj main aane vaale kharch kaa vahan marij ke parijanon ko karnaa hoga
 Kishore Kunal said that money will also be taken from checks in all hospitals
 unhone kaha ki marijon ko kisi tarah kii pareshaani naa ho iske liye jald hi saare aspataalon main sweaping mashin bhi lagaae jaaenge
 After this, the facility of payment of the amount of treatment expenses will also be started with credit card and debit card
 mahavir mandir prabandhan cameti ke pramukh kishor kunal ne bank se anurodh kiya he ki agar bank mahaviramandirprabandhan kii ore se sanchalit aspataalon main apana stall lagaana chahta he, to mandir prabandhan kii ore se use sthaan uplabdh kara diya jayega
 This will also facilitate the patients coming for treatment
 mandir kii ore se sanchalit saare aspataalon main iske liye jagah kii koi kami nahin he
 Old notes will not be taken in all the hospitals operated by the Mahavir temple
 lekin ilaaj main kisi prakaar kii koi pareshaani nahin aae, isko lekar mandir prabandhan kii ore se ilaaj ke liye aane vaale gambhir rup se biimaar marijon ko mandir prabandhan apane paas se paanch hajaar rupye tak kaa praarambhik ilaaj apane str se shuru kar degaa
 This money will not be taken from the patient
 ilaaj ke abhaav main kisi kii jaan nahin jaae, isko dhyaan main rakhte hue mandir prabandhan kii ore se yah faisla liya gaya he
 The family can deposit the additional expenses of five thousand by cash or check

 According to sources close to Mulayam, Mulayam Singh has now agreed and will not field his candidate
 uske badale main mulaayam ne apane samarthakon ke 38 naamon kii suchi akhilesh yadav ko di he
 Shivpal Yadav is not named in it
 unki jagah unke bete aditya yadav kaa naam suchi main hai
 Apart from this, the names of the four ministers sacked by Akhilesh Yadav are in the list
 ambika choudhary, om prakaash singh, naarad raay, shaadaab fatima jaise chehre bhi is suchi main shaamil hai
 These people are believed to be close to Shivpal Yadav

 usee kii agali kadi main sutara kah rahe hai ki mulaayam singh ab maan gaye hai or akhilesh ke pratyaashiyon ke samaksh apane ummidavaar nahin khadey karenge
 However, the picture of the sp's alliance with the Congress is also clear

 Mulayam Singh was also not in favor of this alliance

 lekin ek press conference main mulaayam ne yah kahkar is sambhaavna ko khaarij kar diya tha ki jo bhi sapa ke saath ladanaa chahta he, usko apni party kaa vilay sapa main karnaa hoga
 But Akhilesh Yadav was in favor of this alliance

 On behalf of SP, Akhilesh Yadav and on behalf of Congress, Ghulam Nabi Azad have said that there will be an alliance between these parties in the next two days
 mulaayam singh is gathbandhan ke paksh main bhi nahin the
 The comments congress ke ranneetikaar prashanth kishor ne bhi is silsile main mulaayam se mulaakaat kii thi
 But in a press conference, Mulayam had ruled out the possibility that whoever wants to fight with SP will have to merge his party with SP
 lekin akhilesh yadav is gathbandhan ke pakshdhar the
 Now, if Mulayam does not take his candidate, then it would be considered a big success for Akhilesh too
 yani ki ek to congress ke saath gathbandhan hoga or duusare sapa main voton kaa bikharaav nahin hoga
 In fact, this alliance is expected to benefit in terms of maximum Muslim votes
 yani ki mulaayam ke ummidavaar nahin hone se sapa ke voton kaa bantwaaraa nahin hoga or uskaa paramparaagat yadav-muslim voter party ke saath judaa rahegaa

 Talking about being ready to face any kind of challenge to the integrity of the country, the Air Force on Monday said that any decision to use the Air Force to fight the Naxalites should at least be based on a clear policy of loss of life
 needed
 vaayu senadhyaksh ne kaha ki unki vyaktigat raay he ki maovadiyon se ladane ke liye sena ke istemaal kii jarurat nahin he
 Air Chief Marshal PV Naik told reporters on Monday, "we can attack with utmost efficiency
" baharhaal yah samajha janaa chahie ki agar 250 kilo kaa bam kisi jagah par giraaya jaataa he to iskaa prabhaav kam se kam 800 meter ke daayre main hoga or isse vah log bhi prabhavit honge jo maovadi nahin hai
 "the Chief of the Air Force said," If a situation arises that the use of the Air Force is unavoidable, then the size of the army we are thinking about should be clear so that the loss of life is minimal
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘in sabake baavjood ham apane desh main apane logon ke khilaaf lard rahe hai
 In response to a question, he said, "the Ministry of Home Affairs has not approached us for any assistance in fighting Naxalites
" ’ vaayu senadhyaksh ne ek khabariyaa channel ke saath saakshaatkaar main kaha tha ki naksaliyon se ladane ke liye sena ke istemaal kii jarurat nahin he or is bare main poochne par unhone kaha, ‘vyaktigat taur par meraa ab bhi yahi vichaar he
 He said, "however, we would like to say that even though we are not actively fighting, the Indian Air Force has surveyed the Naxalite affected areas and shared information with the respective governments
" ’ yah poochne par ki kya dantewada hamale se pehle bhartiya vaayu sena ne chhattisgarh sarkaar ko kisi tarah kii jaankaree uplabdh karai thi to unka jawaab na main tha
 He said, 'we deployed uavs in the tribal state a few years ago and provided information at that time
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ve jaankariyaan is samay prayog main nahin laai ja saktin kyonki philhal ham us ilaake main surveykshan nahin kar rahe hai
 "the Chief of Air Staff said," It also needs to be understood that we have some limitations in conducting surveys with uavs
 kisi jagah par badi sankhya main ekajute hue logon ke bare main soochna di ja sakati he lekin yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki yah hathiyaarband logon kaa samooh he yaa saamaanya adivasee or gramin hai
 "said Naik," Also, aerial survey is not possible in dense forests because the equipment cannot see through dense trees and bushes
 ’ dantewada hamale ke peeche khufia soochnaaon ke li hone kii sambhaavna se sambandhit media reporton ke bare main puche jane par nik ne kaha, ‘main na to aisi reporton se avgat hum or na hi li hone ke bare main mujhe andaja he

 Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia's loyalist Mahendra Singh Kalukheda sat in his seat in the Jodhpurpuri suit 10 minutes before the first session of the 14th Assembly of Madhya Pradesh began on the 8th of January
 kuch der baad congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ke khasmkhas ajay singh unki bagal main apni seat par aa baithe
 But Ajay Singh, son of Kalukhera and former Union Minister Arjun Singh, did not even look at each other and neither spoke
 unki yah berukhi yun hi nahin thi
 Both of them had insisted on becoming the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly but nothing came to their hands
 andruni gutbaji kii vajah se congress ko vidhansabha satr main pehle din bina kisi netaa ke shaamil hona padaa tha
 In the evening on the same day, Congress President Sonia Gandhi made Satyadev Katare the Leader of the Opposition in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly
 kataare ko sindhiya gut kaa mana jaataa he
 Central observers Oscar Fernandes sent by the party leadership and c
 pi
 Joshi also witnessed a tussle between Digvijay and the Scindia faction over the post of Leader of Opposition
 digvijay singh kaa khemaa ajay singh ko manonith karwaanaa chahta tha jabaki sindhiya gut kalookheda ko
 The evening of 5 January 4
 15 baje party ke daftar main vipaksh ke netaa ke liye aam sahmati banane kii kavayad bekaar sabit hui
 Congress legislators' meeting ended in just 30 minutes
 iske baad 5 baje se duusari baithak shuru hui jisamen furnandis or joshi ne har vidhayak se baatcheet kii or unase e• form bharvaya jo matdaan patr bhi tha
 On this occasion, 56 of the party's 58 mlas reached the party office, while mlas Manoj Aggarwal and Kamlesh Shah did not attend
 kaaphi mashkkat ke baavjood jab donon kendriya paryvekshak sarvasammati par nahin pahunch paae to unhone sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi se phone par baat kii or party ke pradesh maamalon ke incharge mohan prakaash ke saath karyaalay se baahar nikal aae
 Joshi and Fernandes passed a resolution and left the decision to nominate the Leader of the Opposition to Sonia Gandhi
 yahaan, ek vidhayak narayan treepathi yah kehete sune gaye ki jab hikeman ko hi vipaksh kaa netaa chunanaa tha to phir bhopal main majamaa lagane kii kya jarurat thi
 As soon as the supervisors left, an argument started between Kalukheda and Ajay Singh
 kalookheda kaa daawa tha ki arjuna singh kii mrityu ke baad unki evaj main ajay singh jab vidhayak dal ke netaa bane the tab bhi ve khud is pad ke daavedaar the
 At this, Ajay retorted, saying that Kalukheda had lost his mental balance
 donon guton ke samarthak badi sankhya main party karyaalay ke saamne sadak par utarkar narebaaji karne lage
 The Scindia faction also tried to stop Ajay Singh's car
 kalookheda ke ek najdiki vidhayak kii maane to unke paas 35 vidhayakon kaa samarthan tha jinamein se 12 sindhiya gut, 16 kamalnath gut, 3 pachori gut or 4 vidhayak purv kendriya mantri or saansad arun yadav ke kareebi the
 Meanwhile, a legislator close to Ajay Singh claimed the support of 37 mlas
 yahaan pahunchane se pehle bhi ajay singh ne apane sarkari bangale par vidhayakon kii baithak kii thi
 While Kalukheda had also approached more than 20 mlas of the Scindia faction, including those from Kamal Nath and Suresh Pachauri faction
 yuva vidhayakon vaale pachori gut ne, jiskaa netritv sanjay pathak kar rahe hai, apane pattey nahin khole the
 However, now the Pachauri and Kamal Nath factions are supporting the Scindia faction
 5 janvari ke is tamaashe ke do din baad congress ne satyadev kataare ko vidhayak dal kaa netaa bana diya
 Katare was initially the contender but later retreated
 vaise kamalnath ke kareebi bala bachchan kii najar bhi netaa pratipaksh ke pad par thi lekin apane aakaa ke kehane par ve daud se hat gaye
 Now the challenge is to take Digvijay faction mlas along with Katare
 par bijepi ko gherne ke liye digvijay gut kaa saath milanaa unke liye mushkil hoga
 Obviously, the party has not learned any lesson from the defeat in the assembly elections due to mutual discord
 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi congress digvijay or pachori guton kii aapasi ranjish kii vajah se haar gai thi
 At that time there was no coordination between Ajay Singh, the Leader of Opposition and Chaudhary Rakesh Singh Chaturvedi, Deputy Leader of Pachauri faction
 ajay or chaturvedi ke bich kadavaahat baad main itani bad gai ki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle chaturvedi bijepi main ja mili
 Soon after, after choosing the leader of the Legislative Party, now the high command also has to choose the new party president in the state, because Kantilal Bhuria resigned last month taking responsibility for the party's worst defeat
 nayaa adhyaksh chune jane tak unhen yah jimmedaari sanbhaalane ko kaha gaya he
 Given the factionalism, it is becoming difficult for the central leadership to decide the new state president
 party sutron kaa kahana he ki hikeman arun yadav ko yah jimmedaari dena chahta tha lekin gutbaji ke chalate nirnay atka padaa he
 According to Arun's close friends, he too does not want to take up this responsibility in view of the quarrels and weak condition of the party
 rajnatik vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki andruni gutbaji party ko loksabhaa chunaav main bhi mahangi padane vaali he
 During a two-day state visit in April 2013, activists had bluntly told Rahul Gandhi that factionalism had increased and that the party would lose assembly elections for the third time in a row if it was not scrapped
 kaaryakartaaon ne rahul se kaha tha ki digvijay, kamalnath, pachori or sindhiya gut varchasv ke liye ladate rahete hai
 On his return to Delhi, Rahul started trying to bring all the groups together and gave Scindia the responsibility of the party in the state
 vaise to hikeman sitambar, 2012 main hi sindhiya ko pradesh main party kaa cheharaa ghoshit kar dena chahta tha, lekin digvijay ke virodh kii vajah se sitambar, 2013 ke pehle hafte main hi sindhiya ko pradesh main chunaav prachaar pramukh kii jimmedaari saunpi ja saki
 After this, Digvijay, Kamal Nath, Scindia and Pachauri shook hands and addressed the election meetings from one stage till the election
 lekin yah sab dikhaava tha
 While distributing tickets for assembly elections, big leaders started advocating for their supporters
 kadavaahat itani zyada thi ki jab ummidavaar tay karne ke liye dilli main bulaai gai baithak main kamalnath or sindhiya gaye to bhuriya or ajay singh ne sindhiya se kaha ki ve tikaton ke bantwaare main taang na adaaen
 These fights enabled the candidates to be declared at the last minute and the party had to pay the price
 iske baad bhi party main gutbaji khatm nahin hui
 The extent of this happened when veteran leaders campaigned only for their faction candidates
 digvijay singh sirf raghugarh tak simate rahe kyonki yahaan se unke bete jayavardhan congress ke tikat par chunaav lard rahe the
 Jayawardhan also won
 vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey aate hi dosha mayaae kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 Senior Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi directly blamed Digvijay Singh for the party's defeat
 digvijay ke katu aalochak chaturvedi kaa kahana tha, ‘‘digvijay ko pradesh main koi nahin bulaanaa chahta, kyonki 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main unki haar hui thi
 We could not convince the public
 unhen ashanka thi ki digvijay or unki team satta main aa jaaegi
 People do not like the negative politics of Digvijay and his colleagues
 ’’congress kii ek or varisht netaa kalpana parulekar ne ujjain ke mahidpur se apni haar ke liye digvijay ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya
 He then demanded from the high command that Digvijay's entry into the state should be prohibited, it would be in the party's interest
 iske vipareet ajay singh ke karyaalay se chunaav ke baad media ko email bhej kar bataaya gaya ki gwalior-chambal main party kaa pradarshan kharaab rahaa, jo sindhiya kaa ilaaka he
 The Congress performed well in Ajay Singh's Vindhya region
 loksabhaa chunaav main sirf teen maah bache hai or jhagadon main ulajhaki congress ab bhi bijepi ko takkar dene kii sthiti main nahin he
 Buoyed by the victory in the assembly, the BJP is planning to win all 29 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ko pradesh main 25 siten mili thim
 BJP spokesperson Hitesh Bajpai says, "we are not going to face any challenge from the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections
" vidhansabha main lagaataar teesri haar ke baad congress pradesh main khatm ho gai he
 For example, after the third consecutive defeat in Gujarat, the Congress was left unapproved
 ’’ kya sachmuch pradesh main congress kii haalat gujarat jaisi hone vaali he? Suspense remains on who will become the coach of Team India

 But Delhi Congress is against this alliance
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne iske liye dilli congress ke netaaon ke saath kai baar baithak kii
 After meeting with his leaders, Rahul Gandhi announced that the Congress will not form an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi
 lekin sutron ne bataaya ki congress ke varisht netaa gathbandhan ke paksh main hai
 For this, Congress conducted a survey and opinion poll among its workers
 isamen gathbandhan karne par congress or aam aadmi party ko phayda hote hue dikhaaya
 Senior party leaders then asked Rahul Gandhi to reconsider his decision
 haalanki, abhi tak is par koi faisla nahin hua he
 It is worth noting that Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dixit is against this alliance, but Delhi party in-charge PC Chacko is in its favor
 pisi chaako ne kol karke congress kaaryakartaaon se gathbandhan par raay bhi maangi thi
 According to sources, after meeting senior central leaders, Rahul Gandhi sought opinion from Congress workers on the alliance with Aam Aadmi Party through Shakti app
 iske baad us feedback kaa nateeja rahul gandhi ko de diya gaya he
 Microsoft's new OS Windows10 is gradually replacing people's old OS
 pichley dinon kuch yugers ne twitor par shikaayat kii thi ki unhen nae oes kaa apadet jabardastee diya ja rahaa he
 That is, they had to upgrade to Windows10 even after they were not wanted
 company kaa daawa he ki 110 million divaais main Windows10 apgrade kiya ja chukaa he or ab company ise zyada se zyadadivis main apgredkarne ke liye kuch aise tareeke apnaane ja rahi he jo kaaphi logon ko naapsand hoga
 Actually, due to lack of privacy, many people do not want to use this OS
 yah bhi padhein: android ke liye microsoft kaa Arrow lonchangle saal kii shuruyaat se microsoft puraane oes ko yuj kar raheyugers ke divisamen 'recommended update' ke jariye nayaa oes jabardastee apgrade karegaa
 In such a situation, even if you do not want to, your computer will automatically upgrade to Windows10
 microsoft windos ke head ne tech website da varj se baatcheet main bataaya ki yugers ko Windows10 apgrade karne kaa opsh diya jayega
 However, this option will not be easily understood by the common users as it will require some changes by going to the update settings
 matlab yah he ki agar aapako windos kii zyada jaankaree nahin he to aapke computer main Windows10 khud se apgrade ho jayega
 Significantly, Microsoft wants to upgrade this new OS to all computers because the company is earning more than this
 visheshgyon kii maane to is oes main kuch aisi khamiyaan hai jinaki vajah se yugers kii privesi ko khatra he

 zyaadaatar rajya sarkarein bhi is bill ko chaahati thim

 The Finance Minister said that during talks with various political parties, we have accepted their demands, but never compromised on the basic element
 unhone bataaya ki ab hamaara lakshya jiesti ko lagu karne ke liye zaruri kanoonon ko varsh 2017 main sansad ke samaksh rakhana he, lekin usase pehle rajyasabha dwaara kiye gaye atirikt sanshodhano ko loksabhaa main rakhaa janaa hoga

 Hrithik Roshan's 'krrish 3' has become the highest grossing film in Bollywood
 isse pehle yah record shahrukh khan starer 'chennai express' ke naam tha, jisane is saal box offis par 227 karod rupee kii record kamai kii thi
 Chennai Express broke the record of Aamir Khan's '3 Idiots' (2009)
 aapako bataa den ki 202 karod rupee kii kamai ke saath '3 idiyats' sabase zyada collection karne vaali film ban gai thi or lagaataar teen saalon tak uskaa yah record kaayam rahaa
 But Chennai Express, released this year, broke these records by earning Rs 227 crore
 ab kuch maheenon baad 'krish 3' ne 'chennai express' kaa record tod diya
 It is worth noting that 'krrish 3' was released on November 1 and the film has earned Rs 231 crores till November 16 and the earning is still going on
 mjedaar baat yah he ki krish 3 or chennai express donon ke hi naam relies ke chaar din ke andar-andar 100 karod rupee kii kamai karne kaa record he
 Most of the stories in this collection by the storyteller Prem Bhardwaj are an expression of resistance against political and social forces
 saamaajik sarokaaron ke prati sachet rachanaakaar ne hamaare aasapaas kii drishy-adrishy hakikaton, baichaiyn kar dene vaali ghatnaon or tuutate-bikharate jivan ke moort-amoort byoron ko puure panepan se ukera he
 There is nothing left in the eyes of the story-storyteller of a village or a city, a low class or a middle class, political, administrative wager, or a victim of public oppression, or the story of a woman victim of government repression
 chaahe vah sangrah kii shreshth kahani shahar kii maut ho, chaahe aparadhbodh kii anitha jaise paatr hon yaa jaden kahani ke nayak kaa aatmsangharsh, kahanikar anayas samvednaa kii tah tak pahunchakar sadgipurn bhashaa ke sahare marmasthal ko chune main safal hota he
 But Aakash Chupke is an outspoken, realistic story composed in the backdrop of a communal problem
 berogari, naksalwad, babari vidhwans se upji saamaajik vishmata or krantikari saathi somada jaise paatro ke jariye pragatisheel sanghathanon main ubharate burjuawad or antarvirohi chehre, unke charitra or badali chaal vaale paatro kii aamad par lekhkeey chintaa pathakon kaa dhyaan khinchati he
 The title story is the poignant tale of opportunistic escapism, violence, and the party's holtheimer character's powerlessness, sabotage, sadness, frustration, internal sabotage and the gradual collapse of the waiting fifth dream in such organizations
 aisi kahaniyon main rachanaakaar sachet man se sarokaaron kii lambii ladaai main khud saajheedaar banakar saamaajik shaktiyon ke khilaaf tanakar khadaa ho jaataa he
 At some places, the writer is unable to stop himself from becoming a spokesperson
 adhikansh kahaniyon main aam aadmi ke jeevansangharsh, bebasii, vigat kii yaadon ke khauf tale manushya hone kii yatnaa ko nirmamata se ujagar kiya gaya he
 Leaving aside the lighthearted experiment, most of the stories go beyond linguistic wonders and are woven differently on the ground of reality
 prachur kalpana shakti ke jariye rachi-buni, saundaryabodh or prem kii taralata main dubi kritrim duniya kaa aatmagat samvaad dhire-dhire bade sawaalon ko choota hua aam aadmi kii vyathaa-katha baanchate hue insaaniyat kii aawaaj uthaane lagata he
 It may not have been the author's intention to create a fictional bliss, so the story of the characters does not give up the reality
 phantency naamak khubasurat kahani jarur anuthe tareeke se kaalpanik sammohan kaa jaadu rachati he, jise padhakar pathak anayas pahunch jaataa he ek maasoom duniya kii taraf jahaan chal, vidwesh, avasarwaad yaa swarthparata se bilkul alag duniya bichhi hui he
 Instead of creating a fixed pattern of love and artistic beauty, the author has chosen a rough rock of reality on which he is determined to fight himself and a long battle of concerns
 aisi manobhumi par samvednaa ke bhal bhal behate jhrane bhala kyunkar footte? inhen chattaanon ke bich kahin-kahin riste jhranon ke nishaan jarur kahaniyon ne chode hai

 ' kuch is andaaj main aajkal bihar (bihar) ke mukhyamantri or janata dal united (JDU) ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) apane pratyaashiyon ke liye vot maang rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar holds three to four meetings every day
 har jagah yaa to apane party ke pratyaashee yaa sahyogi dalon ke pratyaashiyon ke liye apane kaam par vot maangate hai
 On Friday, in Belaganj, in support of party candidate Vijay Manjhi, son of former MP Bhagwatiyan Devi, Nitish reminded the public how he left no stone unturned in honor of Dashrath Manjhi, the icon of the Manjhi Samaj
 haalanki gaya seat ke pratyaashee jeethanram maanjhi kaa naam lekar nitish ne kaha ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main haar ke baad unhone unhen mukhyamantri banaaya lekin unhone apni sarkaar ke khilaaf taana-bana bunana shuru kar diya
 Nitish Kumar knows that Manjhi is displeased with the removal of Jitan Ram in the society, so he says that if he lived properly, he would have remained in the chair even today
 nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ke bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) kii tarif ke vaakya bahut adhik nahin hote
 But they definitely say that during Modi ji's time there has been progress, prestige and work in every field in the country
 or phir un logon kii bhi, apane saath aae ramvilas paswan ke bhaashan kii charchaa karte hai ki unhone kendra sarkaar ke sab kaamon ko ginaya he or phir ve use doharaana nahin chaahate
 He then starts referring to his work in Bihar, in which he discusses in detail the seven benefits of the work, especially, the benefits that people are benefiting from every house, tap water and every house electricity
 saath hi saath apane virdohi kaskar argedy par akshep lagaana nahin bhoolatey ki ab bihar main laalaten ke sahare raajnneeti karne waalon kii laal team kii jarurat nahin rahi kyonki ab bihar main har din 5200 megawatt bijli kii khapat ho rahi he
 Nitish Kumar names neither Lalu nor Tejashwi, but at the beginning of the speech, his anguish is reflected in Tejashwi's use of wrong words in speeches and tweets
 phir nitish logon ko yaad dilaate hai ki pehle kaa jamaana yaad kiijie ki kaise gaddha main sadak hota tha yaa sadak main gaddha
 It was difficult to know
 phir nitish kehete hai ki kaam ke aadhaar par vot maangane aae hai
 They are ready to debate with anyone on this issue
 nitish (nitish Kumar) ke bhaashan main alpsankhyak samudaay khaskar muslim samudaay ke prati unki bhaavana dikhti he
 It is clear from his speeches that he knows that the Muslim community may not support him in this election, so he repeatedly discusses the work done for the minority community
 unhen yaad dilaate hai ki pehle madrasa kii kya sthiti thi or ab madrasa kii kya sthiti ho gai he
 Nitish declares that the construction of a minority residential school will definitely begin after the Lok Sabha elections
 lalu yaa tejasvi kaa naam liye bina kehete hai ki kuch log satta main aana chaahate hai kyonki ve mewa paanaa chaahate hai
 Finally, Nitish does not forget to say a sentence that in democracy democracy is the owner

 Let me tell you that earlier in 2014, actress Preity Zinta accused Ness Wadia of harassing her during a match

 However, the case was later withdrawn by Preity Zinta
 australian cricket luk pommersbatch ne yah kabool kiya he ki unhone america mahila ke saath sharaab ke nashe main chhedchhad kii thi
 In the subsequent quarrel, American woman Johal Hameed's fiancee was beaten up
 tippaniyan Luke has given this statement to Delhi Police under Section 161
 pehle vah media main apni is harakat se mukar gaye the
 Now everyone is waiting for what statement he makes in the court
 bataa den ki royal chalangers bangalore ke ipel cricketer luk pommersbatch se chhedchhad kii shikaar america mahila johal hamid ne aarope lagaaya tha ki cricketer ne uskaa chumban lene kii koshish kii or jab unhone uske saath drink lene se inkaar kiya to usne uske mangetar ko kai ghunse jade
 Pomerbash allegedly molested the woman and beat her fiancée after an IPL party at a five-star hotel in the city
 luk ne yah bayaan main dhara 161 ke tahat dilli police ko diya he
 Earlier, he had turned away from this act in the media
 ab sabhi ko is baat kaa intjaar he ki vah adaalat main kya bayaan dete hai
 Let me tell you that American woman Johal Hameed, who was a victim of IPL cricketer Luke Pomersbach of Royal Challengers Bangalore, alleged that the cricketer tried to kiss her and when he refused to take a drink with her, he punched her fiance with several punches
 
 ipel party ke baad shahar ke ek paanch sitara hotel main pomerbash ne us mahila ke saath kathith taur par chhedchhad kii or uske mangetar ko peeta

 India lost to New Zealand in the first semi-final of the Cricket World Cup 2019
 is haar ke saath hi bharat kaa vishwa cap kaa sapana chakanachur ho gaya he
 India fought hard in this exciting match, but New Zealand proved to be better than India
 saal 2011 main cricket vishwa cap jeetne vaali team india ke sadsy rahe sachin tendulkar ne is maamle main baatcheet kii he
 Sachin Tendulkar said that i am disappointed because we should have met 240 target
 haalanki ken williamson kii captaini behtareen thi
 He put up an excellent field setting during this match
 yahi kaaran he ki kohli bolt ke saamne funs gaye
 But it is also true that you cannot depend on your top form players every time
 jab ham jitate hai to ham ek team ke taur par jitate hai or jab ham haarate hai to team ke taur par hi haarate hai
 Talking about the number four batsman, Sachin said that it depends on the team that the captain and management send in such a delicate situation for batting
 mujhe lagata he ki agar number 5 par dhoni hote to chijen alag ho sakati thim
 Dhoni was constantly talking to him during Jadeja's innings and after watching his game it seemed that he was controlling the whole situation
 mujhe lagata he ki middle order ke visphotak ballebaaj hone ke baad jab hardik pandya or pant jaise khilaadiyon ko partnership banane kii jarurat thi to unhone apane wicket ganvaa die
 Actually he needed a different mindset in this situation
 number 4 par pant or number 5 par dhoni hote or pant ke saath kuch usee tarah chizon ko control karne kii koshish karte jaisaa unhone jadeja ke saath kiya or agar pant or hardik, em es dhoni ke saath 5-7 overs tik jate to sthiti kuch or ho sakati thi
 It may have been the team's strategy to try to control New Zealand's swing by sending Dinesh Karthik to number 5, and to keep the ball as old as possible so that stars like Dhoni and Jadeja could finally play India Could put in the bag lekin is baat main koi do raay nahin ki bharat ke top teen ballebaajon ke out hote hi madhyakram par kaaphi dabaav aa gaya or chunki bharat ke top teen ballebaaj puure toornament main behtareen pradarshan kar rahe hai, aise main unke saste main nipat jane ke saath hi madhyakram expoj ho gaya
 i think it would be unfit to criticize Rohit for this match
 unhone puure toornament main behtareen pradarshan kiya he lekin main kahin naa kahin ummid kar rahaa tha ki ke el rahul ko acha pradarshan karnaa chahie tha
 He scored a brilliant century in the last match but i got some negative energy in his batting
 yahi chijen mujhe kohli main dekhne ko mili kyonki ve pich par aate hi baahar jaati gend ko chhedane kii koshish kar rahe the jiske chalate bolt ne unhen kuch outswingrs ke baad inaswinger par fansaa liya gaya
 i think the performance of India also changed due to the pressure
 jadeja ke bare main baat karte hue unhone kaha ki aaj subah jab jadeja ne ross tailor ko ran out kiya to ham camentry box main baat kar rahe the ki aaj jadeja kaa din hone ja rahaa he or aakhirkaar aisa hi hua
 He surprised New Zealand with his batting
 unke bat se jo awaz aa rahi thi, wo shandaar thi
 However it is unfortunate that they could not save the match for us
 boria majumdaar ke saath baatcheet par aadhaarit The party has left the decision on whether the member of the bjp's guiding board and the senior-most leader of the party, Lal Krishna Advani (LK Advani) will once again contest the Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi ke kuch netaaon ke mutabik adwani (LK Advani), murali manohar joshi (murli Manohar Joshi) , sumitra mahajan, shanta kumaar, bi si khandudi, hukum dev narayan yadav, bi es yedyurappa jaise pachhattar paar netaaon ke chunaav ladane par koi roak nahin he
 He says that such a rule is not about contesting elections
 lekin yah tay he ki agar ve chunaav jeet kar aate hai to 75 paar ke in netaaon ko koi mantri pad nahin diya jayega
 BJP leaders also say that the decision not to contest the election of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj is their own and the party has not taken any decision yet
 sushamaa swaraj or uma bharti ne swasthya kii drushti se chunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 However, it is not known whether 91-year-old Advani and 84-year-old Joshi would like to contest again
 joshi ke kareebi sutron ke anusaar party jo bhi faisla karegi, ve use maanenge
 Significantly, veteran BJP leaders LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi, Shanta Kumar and BC Khandoodi were not included in the government despite winning elections in 2014
 sutron ke anusaar adwani lok sabha adhyaksh banane ke icchuk the
 But the party entrusted this responsibility to Sumitra Mahajan
 itnaa hi nahin, modi mantrimandal main may 2014 main shaamil kiye un mantriyon ko baad main hataa diya gaya jo baad main 75 varsh ko paar kar gaye
 These include senior leaders like Cabinet Ministers Najma Heptulla and Kalraj Mishra
 sarkaar se alag rakhe jane par in bujurg netaaon kaa gussa bich-bich main footataa rahaa he
 After the bjp's defeat in the Bihar Assembly elections, leaders like Advani, Joshi and Yashwant Sinha wrote letters and questioned the leadership
 lok sabha main kaamkaaj na hone par adwani kai baar khul kar sadan ke bheetar hi naaraazgi jataa chuke he
 In Madhya Pradesh, one such aging BJP leader Babulal Gaur has plagued the party
 ve haal ke vidhansabha chunaav main khud ladanaa chaahate the
 The party later persuaded her daughter-in-law by giving them tickets
 ab ve yah kah kar party ko dhamka rahe hai ki congress unhe bhopal lok sabha seat se ummidavaar bananaa chaahati he
 Another elderly leader Sartaj Singh was removed from the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government after he crossed the age of 75
 vidhansabha chunaav main ve baagi ho gaye or congress ke tikat par hoshangabad se chunaav lade
 However, he was defeated
 uttar pradesh ke badale halaat main bijepi murali manohar joshi or calraj mishra jaise kaddavar brahman netaaon ko chunavi ladaai se alag karne kaa jokhim mol nahin sakati
 Especially when the Congress has entrusted Priyanka Gandhi Vadra with the responsibility of Purvanchal
 congress kii koshish is ilaake main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaane vaale brahman matadaataaon ko apane paale main laane kii he

 In recent times, in spite of heavy inflation in India, inflation in the country is very low in developed countries

 Maharashtra's Women and Child Development Minister Pankaja Munde is again in controversy
 aam aadmi party ne aarope lagaaya he ki pankaja ne apane pad kaa durupyog karte hue blike listed companiyon ko tender baante or supreme court kii guidelins kaa ulanghan kiya
 Pankaja has described these allegations as baseless
 aam aadmi party kii netaa priti sharma menon kaa aarope he ki munde ne anganwari skim main ghapala kiya he
 Preity has also named BJP President Rao Saheb Danve in her charges
 ek press conference main priti ne kaha ki centre or supreme court ke kai faislon main saaf kaha gaya he ki khaane kii paushtik chizon kii supplai thekedaaron se nahin gaanvon main chalane vaale self help group or mahila mandalon se lee jaaegi, lekin pankaja munde ne kontrectprivet companiyon kodie

 rashtriya rajdhani ke najadik noida ke rahane vaale 24 saal ke noujvaan radhe rana ne jab 27 janvari ko apane fasebuk timeline par yah states apadet kiya, to usase jaanane vaale zyaadaatar logon ko yah shekhi baghaarne vaali baat lagi
 In about 4 hours some of his friends liked this status and seven wrote their comments
 lekin is fasebuk states ke thik paanch din baad jab radhe ne apane doston ke saath noida ke hi ek gym main dhaava bol kar do naujavaanon ko lahuluhan kar diya, to sabhi ko yah samajhate der nahin lagi ki radhe apane is fasebuk states ko lekar kitna syrius tha
 Radhe and her gang enter the gym and hit 21-year-old Amarpal and Rohit with rods and dumbbells so badly that the condition of the two worsens
 chunki amarpal torget par tha, use chot zyada lagi
 In a hurry, the two were admitted to the metro hospital, where Amarpal died on the morning of 6 February
 fasebuk par bhaawanaaon kaa izhaar to khayr koi nai baat nahin he
 
 
 But after the announcement of revenge on the social site, this incident of murder is certainly new and unique in its kind
 is ailaania katl ke baad beshak noida sector 24 kii police ne radhe ke do doston vikaas rana or shripal ko giraftaar kar liya lekin is vaake ne naujavaanon main khatm hote sanyam or dikhaave kii jindagi ke paagalpan ko phir se saamne laa diya
 Especially because Radhe, who along with his friends, killed Amarpal on a trivial matter, was once a good friend of Amarpal himself
 jameen ke muaavje ke badale raturaat karodon main khel rahe noida ke naujavaanon ke liye acchhee gaadi, gathila badan, ladakiyon se dosti or filmi jindagi nae shauk hai
 Those who know Amarpal say that the desire to look smart pulled him to the master gym in Sector 12, Noida, a few months from now
 apane bhaaiyon ke doodh ke kaarobaar main haath bantane vaale amarpal kii yaheen radhe or uske group se dosti hui
 But two months ago, while passing through the street, a minor scratch in Amarpal's bike from Radhe's bike became the reason for the enmity between the two
 donon main isi baat par tab ladaai bhi hui thi, lekin tab bade-bujurgon ke bich-bachaav ke baad maamla shant ho gaya tha
 But the reality was that even though this battle looked calm from above, it was not quiet from inside
 ab ishaaron hi ishaaron main radhe ne fasebuk par amarpal ko lalkaarna shuru kar diya
 He uploaded pictures of the realities on Facebook several times and also wrote abuses several times
 ek baar to usne apane timeline par desi pistaul or goliyon kii tasviren tak post kar daali or phir ant main likhaa, “dosto, mujhe kisi se badla lenaa he
 
 
 You support me! " But even then no one had any idea of radhe's plan
 noida ke esaspi praveen kumaar kehete hai, “hamen radhe ke aise kisi fasebuk states ke bare main pehle koi jaankaree nahin thi

 purv bhartiya cricket captain anil kumble kaa maananaa he ki viraat kohli ke paas bhartiya test ballebaaji kram main ahm tisare sthaan par feet hone ke liye ‘sahi khel’ he
 However, he also said that it would be impossible for anyone to replace Rahul Dravid
 kumble ne kaha, ‘maine under 19 main viraat ke khilne ke samay se us par kareebi najar rakhi he or vah kaaphi paripakv hua he
 i am impressed by the kind of improvement he has made in the last one year in terms of sports, discipline and fitness
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘usne kade antarrashtriya cricket ke saath teji se saamanjasy baitha liya he or 23 varshiya khilaadi ke liye aisa karnaa shandaar he
 He scored a century in Test cricket in Australia and i believe he has the right game to fit in third place
 ’ is purv captain ne kaha, ‘haalanki koi bhi rahul dravid kii jagah nahin le saktaa
 He has achieved in the last 16 years and surely it will not be easy to score 23 thousand international runs
 ’100 antarrashtriya shatak kii aitihaasik uplabdhi hasil karne ke liye sachin tendulkar kii saraahna karte hue kumble ne kaha ki vah teji se vibhinn halaat se saamanjasy baitha letaa he jo mahaan khilaadi kii nishaani he
 Kumble said, 'I witnessed 80 of these 100 centuries and stood at the other end on at least 20 occasions
 main us samay ballebaaji ke liye aata tha jab vah 80 ran ke aasapaas bana chukaa hota tha or nayi gend lee jane vaali hoti thi
 My job on every occasion is that i do not lose my wicket easily to help him score a century
 ’ tendulkar ne apana 100waan shatak puraa karne ke baad bangladesh ke khilaaf 248 ran ke apane sarvshereshth score ke dauraan ajeeb ghatnaon ko yaad kiya tha jab vah or kumble kai baar galatfahami kaa shikaar hue
 Kumble said, 'don't talk about it
 main ab bhi jab us match ke footage dekhtaa hum to sharmasaar ho jaataa hum
 a memorable event for this former Indian captain is Tendulkar's first Test century at Old Trafford in 1990, which was also Kumble's debut Test
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe old traverd kii balkoni main teen ghante se adhik khadaa rakhaa gaya kyonki yah kiran more kaa farmaan tha
 Sachin was scoring runs and we were playing to save the Test, so all were superstitious
 vahaan do ghante khadaa hona bhi mushkil tha lekin kiran ne mujhe ghanton tak usee sthiti main khadey rahane kaa nirdesh diya
 Only during the tea break did i get a chance to sit
 ’ kumble ne kaha, ‘beshak sidney main 242 ran kii pari ek or bejod prayaas tha jahaan usne 200 ran puure hone tak ek bhi cover drive nahin lagaaya
 100 against Pakistan and 155 against Australia (both in Chennai) when Shane Warne was bowling round the wicket, he has some innings that i can never forget
 ’test maichon main 619 or vanade main 337 wicket chatakaane vaale kumble ke liye test cricket ab bhi praathamikta he
 Regarding leg-spinner Rahul Sharma, who has played only five matches (three odis and two T20s) during the last six months of his association with the Indian team, Kumble said it was a strange situation
 unhone kaha, ‘aapako match main kaaphi over phenkane hote hai lekin saath hi apni sarvshereshth team bhi chunani hoti he
 The ideal situation would have been that Rahul would play some first-class matches, but the problem nowadays is that practice matches are very few on the tour
 jab main 1990 main england gaya tha to hamane do vanade or teen test ke alaava nau pratham shrenee match khele the
 Everyone had a chance, which does not happen now
 ’ kumble haalanki bangalore main rashtriya cricket academy main adhyaksh ke rup main ek saal ke apane sankshipt kaarykaal ke bare main bolne se bache
 He resigned from his post in December last year
 unhone kaha, ‘main us samay ke bare main baat nahin karnaa chahta
 i wanted to do some things but there was no consensus but NCA has done a lot of good for Indian cricket
 ensie ke kaaran hi hamaare paas viraat, suresh raina, manoj tiwari jaise behtareen kshetrarakshak hai
 'BCCI wants Ranji Trophy matches to be played at neutral venues but Kumble wants cricket to be shifted to smaller centers which will provide good competitive wickets
