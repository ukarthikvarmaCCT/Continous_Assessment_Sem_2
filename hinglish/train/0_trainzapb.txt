 bharat abhi tak apni urja jaruraton ke liye khadi deshon par nirbhar tha
 The Trump Modi meet during the G-20 and earlier visits to the US has a new beginning
 itihaas main pehali baar bharat ne america se kaccha tel khareednaa shuru kiya he
 Not only India but before that countries like China, Korea are now moving away from Gulf countries and buying crude oil from America
 america main gaiyrkanoonee kaam tha kachche tel ko bechneyb se do saal pehle america main yah sochaa bhi nahin ja saktaa tha ki koi deshkache tel kii saplalmerica se legaa
 But now crude oil-filled tankers are coming out of the American port and reaching the coast of dozens of Asian countries
 beete teen saal se vaishvik str par kachche tel kii keemton main giravat, tel companiyon ke diwalia hone or sector main badhati berogari ke chalate america ne apni tel companiyon ko bechney kii manjuuri de di he
 The Obama government has approved that for the last 40 years, there was a ban on selling crude oil to any country in America
 sivaae canada ke america tel companiyaan duniya ke kisi desh ko kaccha tel nahin bech sakati thim
 But after the huge fall in crude oil prices in 2015, the Barack Obama administration in the US weakened the ban and allowed Asian countries to sell oil to save oil companies
 america se bharat ke liye tel ke tanker ravaanabharat kachche tel kaa duniya main teesraa sabase bada kharidaar desh he or yah kharid abhitak vah khadi deshon se kiya karata tha
 But after the recent meeting of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump, for the first time India has purchased crude oil from America
 bhartiya company indian oil ne america kii tel company se pehali khep kachche tel kii kharid ko puraa kar liya he or is saal oktober tak kachche tel se bhare tanker bharat ke port par pahunchnaa shuru ho jayega
 The strong supply of crude oil to Asia, after getting approval from the Barack Obama administration in 2015, crude oil exports to the US Kaisia were increasing gradually
 lekin 2017 main america companiyon ko lagbhag ek darjan asian deshon se kachche tel kaa order milane laga
 According to current data, American companies are selling crude oil to Asian countries for about 15% of their total production
 kyon asia ko bechaa ja rahaa he america kaccha tel2014 main vaishvik str par kachche tel kii keemton main badi giravat darj hona shuru hui thi
 After this, by 2015, crude oil prices in the international market reached $ 20 per barrel
 iske asar se duniyabar kii tel companiyon ke liye production ghate kaa sauda banane laga
 This directly impacted the American oil sector and during this time more than 1 lakh people from the oil sector in the US alone became unemployed
 obama kii majaburi, trump kaa phaaydalihaaja, oil sector par ai is musiibat se bachane ke liye jahaan baraak obama prashasan ne kaccha tel bechney par lage pratibandh ko hataa diya vahiin nae raashtrapati donald trump kii nitiyon ke liye yah faisla behad ahm ho gaya
 The Trump administration argues that it is resorting to exports to the oil sector merely to sustain global demand-supply
 lekin sector ke jaankaron kaa daawa he ki isse asia kii khadi deshon par kachche nirbharta kam hogi or kachche tel niryaat main america bhagidaari main ijapha hoga
 At the same time, the increase in US revenue from this export will help in creating new jobs along with Donald Trump's America First program

 'input: IANS The Real Estate (regulation and Development) Act 2016, which came into force from 1 May 2017, will reduce the tussle between buyers and builders
 vahiin builder makaan bechate samay itani khubiyaan ginaata he ki wo swarg lagane lagata he lekin baad main mukar jaataa he
 The builders also have problems
 jaraa jaanaten hai ki kharidaaron or bilderon kii chunautiyon kaa rera main kya samaadhaan hua he, yaa nahin
 Seven challenges of buyers - 1
 sahi aria bataakar builder flats nahin bechata
 The carpet area means the area available for living is much less than the builder's stated area
 2
 The builder himself pays a nominal penalty (rs 5 to 10 per sqft) for the delay in the project
 jabaki kharidaar ke bhugtan main vilamb par 18 se 24 fisadi kii penalty letaa he
 There was no hearing on delay
 pajeshan kii taarikh nahin bataata he
 3
 project ke bich main hi builder nirmaan ke dhaanche main badlaav kar letaa he
 4
 project kaa vistrut byoraa (mukademebaaji, jameen kaa byor, sarkaar se manjuuri) nahin miltaa he
 5
 paisa lekar duusare project main builder paisa laga detaa he
 6
 nirmaan main khami milane par builder nahin sunata tha
 7
 maujuuda kharidaaron, jinhen saat-aath saal se flats nahin mila he ko muaavja kaise milegaa
 Solution-1- In RERA, RERA has the obligation to specify the carpet area at the time of project launch
 2
 There is a provision of equal penalty on both the builder and the buyer
 pajeshan kii taarikh bataanaa builder ke liye anivaary hoga
 If the possession is not received on time, the RERA can take compensation by complaining to the authority
 3
 Two-thirds of buyers' approval would be required to change the construction structure
 4
 At the time of project launch, it will be mandatory to give all the details on the website
 5
 It is mandatory to keep 70 percent of the amount for the construction work by opening a separate account
 6
 It will be the responsibility of the builder to correct the construction failure by five years after the possession
 7
 All projects underway on or after May 1 will be subject to RERA but there will be no provision for late compensation for projects that have completed the completion certificate
 bilderon kii samasyaayein-1
 In case of delay in the project from the government agency, its responsibility should not be passed on to the builder
 2
 After purchasing the land, the builder has to take more than two dozen clearances to make the process easier
 4
 Clearance should be given to the builder by the government departments under the online single window system
 3
 In the process of building a house, the buyer, the builder and the government are the three parties
 The responsibility of all three should be equal
 rera main samaadhaan-1
 The Act does not prescribe any responsibility for government jobs
 2
 No mention of any pre-project process
 3
 There is no time and online process for government departments to approve
 4
 The responsibility of the builder and buyer is not fixed but no mention of governmental expenditure
 gajiabad ke vakil ramanand goyal kehete he kibade builder aria kam dete hai
 Loot in the name of Super Area
 karpet aria bataanaa padegaa to ye rate bhi badha denge
 The government says 20 percent
 lekin builder super aria kaa 40 fisadi kaat letaa he

 kareeb mahinebhar pehle bijepi chhodane vaale navjot singh siddhu aam aadmi party main shaamil honge yaa nahin, ise lekar suspence badhane laga he
 After the resignation from the Rajya Sabha, Sidhu has not had any positive results from the secret meetings he has held with Aam Aadmi Party leaders and CM Arvind Kejriwal
 aam aadmi party ke sutron ke mutabik navjot singh siddhu ne punjab main siem candidet banaae jane kii maang kii he lekin party ke netaa siddhu ko star prachaarak ke taur par chunavi maidan main utaarna chaahate hai
 With the start of August not being in favor of making AAP Sidhu the CM candidate, the discussion within the party was intensified that Sidhu would officially join the Aam Aadmi Party as soon as he returned from Vipassana
 lekin sutron kii maane to netaaon ke saath baatcheet safal na hone kii vajah se maamla khinchataan chalaa ja rahaa he
 Actually the Aam Aadmi Party is not in favor of making Navjot Singh Sidhu the Chief Ministerial candidate
 isaki ek badi vajah siddhu par laga hatya kaa aarope he
 Sidhu wants for himself and his wife, the ticket is not seeking any risk and the party does not want to get involved in any controversy unnecessarily
 party sutron ke mutabik tamaam netaaon ne aam aadmi party ke samvidhan kaa hawala dete hue pati or patni donon ko tikat dene se inkaar kar diya he
 In this constitution, 2 members from the same family are not given the right to contest elections

 But talks with Navjot Singh Sidhu's insistence on the chief minister's post seem to be deteriorating
 19 july ko navjot singh siddhu ne rajyasabha or bijepi se istipha diya tha
 Assembly elections are due in Punjab next year, in such a situation, if the suspense of Sidhu joining the party does not end soon, then the Aam Aadmi Party's concern can definitely increase

 Nitish Kumar defended his decision to return to the NDA in 2017, four years after breaking ties with the BJP, stating that he had taken this decision keeping in mind the interest of Bihar
 unhone aatankwaad or antarrashtriya manch par desh kii pratishtha badhaane ko lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi kii saraahna kii
 Lalu Yadav shared a clipping of the 2014 newspaper which featured Nitish Kumar's statement, 'I will meet in mud but will not join BJP again
 ' Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad Yadav challenged the Gandhian Anna Hazare, who is campaigning against corruption, to contest elections, saying that elections in the country are not based on any idea, action or plan but only on the basis of casteism
 cheharaa pahachaanen, jeeten inam
 To participate, Yadav, who came to see Vindhyavasini Devi, said, 'anna Hazare and his team form a party and contest the elections, then see what the election is
 desh main matdaan sirf jati ke aadhaar par hi hota he na ki kisi vichaar, yojana athwa kaam par
 The basis of elections in the entire country is only casteism
 ’unhone kaha, ‘anna hamaare abhibhavak hai or vah khud bhi maanate hai ki janalokapal se sirf 60 pratishat bhrashtachar hi ruk sakegaa lekin baaki 40 fisadi kaa kya hoga
 Who will stop him ’ purv rail mantri ne kaha, ‘kya bharosa ki lokapal banane vaala vyakti eemaandaar hi ho
 Who will stop him desh kii nas nas main bhrashtachar bharaa he use lokapal ke jariye nahin hataaya ja saktaa
 Member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee, Yadav said that there was a discussion in the committee on bringing electronic media and corporate houses under the purview of Lokpal
 yadav ne uttar pradesh kii kanoon-vyavastha ke bare main kaha, ‘jahaan kaa mantri hi chor sabit ho jaae vahaan kanoon-vyavastha kaa haal kya bayaan karun
 Yadav demanded that all the ministers who have been convicted of corruption by the Lokayukta of Uttar Pradesh should be sent to jail
 rajd ke pradesh adhyaksh ashok singh ne is maukey par kaha ki unki party uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke aagaamee chunaav main 30 se 35 siton par chunaav lard sakati he, lekin uski yah jang dharmanirpeksh maton ko kaatane yaa udaaravaadi soch rakhane vaali shaktiyon ko kamjor karne ke liye nahin hogi
 He said that in the region where the rjd's position is good, the party will contest elections only in those areas
 singh ne kaha ki chunaav ke baad bhaajapa is vakt sattarudh basapa se gathbandhan kar legi
 Therefore, rjd's effort is that the candidates of these two parties cannot win the election
 iske liye sapa adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav se milakar yojana banaai ja rahi he

 The court asked the petitioner NGO, 'what is your locus in this matter? And what work are you doing in Punjab for the good of the people? Do you have evidence of the work you are doing there? "" Many dialogues are extremely vulgar "on the other hand, the Supreme Court asked the film's producers that the film made many dialogues are extremely vulgar, are they really needed? Shouldn't it be removed? On this, advocate Minakshi Arora, appearing on behalf of the producers, said, 'if you look at the dialogues in Cut 5 separately, they seem objectionable, but if you look at the entire film, you will find that those dialogues are very important
 
 dialogs or bhashaa, film ke behad mahatvapurn pahalu hai

 The woman will also need children's custody
 yah family court main nahin balki magistrate main sab tay hoga

 gauratlab he ki ek lambii ladaai ke baad mangalvaar ko hi sansad ke upree sadan se teen talaak bill paas ho gaya he
 This bill was already passed by the Lok Sabha, just waiting for the signature of President Ramnath Kovind and then it would be a crime to give three divorces in the country
 or iske liye jo bill main praavdhaan laae gaye hai, wo sabhi kanoon ban jaaenge
 Similar arguments were made in the Rajya Sabha on behalf of Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad that Muslim men divorce their wives by citing any reason

 Explain that after the triple talaq bill has become law, it has become a crime to give triple talaq in the country

 farvari 2010 main international cricket main aagaaj ke samay se hi steve smith ko australia kaa behad pratibhavan khilaadi mana jaataa tha
 After making his ODI debut in Melbourne against the West Indies, the all-rounder did not have to wait much longer to play the test
 pakistan ke khilaaf lords ke aitihaasik maidan (neutral venue) main unhone apana test kaa safar prarambh kiya
 Stevie soon began to shine after taking some time to set in international cricket
 kariyar ke prarambh main unki pahchaan ek aise spinner ke rup main thi jo nichle kram main ballebaaji main bhi haath dikhaa letaa tha lekin jald hi gendbaaj ke rup main unki pahchaan dhimi padane lagi or ballebaaj ke rup main ve apana mukaam banaate gaye
 But the same steve is now going through its worst phase as Australia's captain
 ( padhe, bure din australian team kaa peechha nahin chhod rahe, 85 ranon par hui dher) Smith is among the few players in the world whose test and ODI figures are very impressive
 bharat ke viraat kohli, england ke jo root, newjiland ke ken williamsan or dakshin africa ke hashim amala ke saath saath 27 saal ke steve smith ko vishwa cricket ke sabase pratibhavan ballebaajon main shaamil kiya jaataa he
 Till the Hobart Test, 57 of 45 Test matches
 40 ke prabhaavshaalee ausat se unhone 15 shatakon kii madad se 4133 ran banaae hai, vahiin 87 vanade maichon main unhone 41

 haalanki takanic ke lihaaj se smith kushal nahin he lekin apni sangharsh kshamta ke boote ve wicket par rukne or teji se ran banane, donon main safal hai
 It was Smith's genius that he was considered the next contender to take over the reins of the team at the time of Michael Clarke's captaincy
 gauratlab he ki alan border, riki poting or maaikel clark ke netritv ke daur main australia ne kamyaabi kii nai ibaarat likhi
 Smith also had a similar glow in the beginning as captain and batsman

 Against Team India, he scored 930 runs at an average of 93 in 6 Tests which included four centuries
 isi kram main newjiland ke khilaaf unhone 67
 Has scored 543 runs at an average of 87
 lekin ab aisa lagane laga he ki smith kii chamak dhimi padati ja rahi he
 The Australian team's performance in their captain is steadily declining
 tippaniyan In their recent series against Sri Lanka, Australia lost to Australia by a unilateral margin of 0–3, while in the ODI series against South Africa, the Kangaroo team also faced a clean sweep by a margin of 0–5
 kisi ko ummid nahin thi ki lambey samay tak test number van or paanch baar kii world champion australia ke pradarshan main is kadar giravat aa jaaegi
 Not only this, after the defeat in the Test series against Sri Lanka there, the way Steve Smith returned home in the midst of odis, former players like Michael Clarke and Michael Slater also questioned that decision
 aisa lag rahaa he ki haal main australian team ke pradarshan main ai giravat ke kaaran smith saathi khilaadiyon kaa vishwaas hi khote ja rahe hai
 After the ODI, the Kangaroo team has also struggled so far in the Test series against South Africa
 pehla test haarane ke baad duusare test kii pehali pari main bhi australian team mahaj 85 ranon par dher ho gai
 Obviously, Smith will have to do something special to restore confidence in this difficult period
 
 
 interneshal cricket main set hone main kuch samay lene ke baad steve ne jald hi chamak bikhareni shuru kar di
 Early in his career, he was identified as a spinner who showed his hand in batting in the lower order, but soon his identity as a bowler began to slow down and he made his mark as a batsman
 lekin vahi steve ab australia ke captain ke taur par apane sabase kharaab daur se guzar rahe hai
 (read, bad days are not giving up the Australian team chase, pile on 85 runs) smith duniya ke un chand khilaadiyon main hai jinke test or vanade ke aankade behad prabhaavshaalee hai
 Virat Kohli of India, Joe Root of England, Ken Williamson of New Zealand and Hashim Amla of South Africa, along with 27-year-old Steve Smith are among the most talented batsmen in world cricket
 hobart test ke pehle tak jahaan 45 test maichon main 57
 With an impressive average of 40, he has scored 4133 runs with the help of 15 centuries, while 41 in 87 odis
 31 ke ausat se 2644 ran score kiye hai jisamen 6 saikade shaamil hai
 Although Smith is not skilled in terms of technique, he is successful both in stopping the wicket and scoring fast due to his ability to struggle
 yah smith kii pratibha hi thi ki maaikel clark kii captaini ke samay main hi unhen team kaa bagdor sanbhaalane kaa aglaa daavedaar mana jane laga tha
 Significantly, under the leadership of Alan Border, Ricky Potting and Michael Clarke, Australia wrote a new chapter of success
 smith main bhi captain or ballebaaj ke taur par shuruyaat main aisi hi chamak dikhaai
 They were extremely successful against India
 team india ke khilaaf unhone 6 test main 93 ke ausat 930 ran banaae jisamen chaar shatak shaamil the
 67 against New Zealand in the same sequence
 87 ke ausat se 543 ran banaae hai
 But now it seems that Smith's brightness is slowing down
 unki captaini main australian team ke pradarshan main lagaataar giravat aa rahi he
 The comments haal hi main srilanka ke khilaaf siries main unki captaini main australia ko 0-3 ke ekatarfa antar se haar mili , vahiin dakshin africa ke khilaaf vanade siries main bhi kangaroo team ko 0-5 ke antar se clin sweep kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 No one expected that the performance of long-time Test number one and five-time world champion Australia would fall so much
 yahi nahin, srilanka ke khilaaf vahaan hui test siries main haar ke baad jis tarah se vanade maichon ke bich steve smith swadesh laute, maaikel clark or maaikel slator jaise purv khilaadiyon ne us faisle par bhi sawaal uthaae
 It seems that Smith is losing the confidence of fellow players due to the recent decline in Australian team performance
 vanade ke baad dakshin africa ke khilaaf test siries main bhi kangaroo team ab tak sangharsh karti najar ai he
 After losing the first test, in the first innings of the second test, the Australian team was reduced to just 85 runs
 jaahir he, is mushkil daur main smith ko vishwaas bahaali ke liye kuch khaas karnaa hoga

 In Shiv Sena's Dussehra rally at Shivaji Park, Mumbai, the party president Uddhav Thackeray attacked the BJP and the Maharashtra government fiercely
 ram mandirke mudde unhone kaha ravan har saal aata he lekin ram mandir nahin aata
 On welcoming Bhagwat, on the issue of Tanjaram temple on Modi, Uddhav Thackeray said that Ravana comes every year but Ram temple does not come
 piem modi kaa naam liye bina thakare ne kaha ki dhanush or baan uthaane ke liye kuch inch kii chaati nahin, himmat chahie
 He said that he congratulated Mohan Bhagwat for his statement on the Ram temple
 unhone jo kaha he ham kai saalon se kehete aa rahe hai
 Uddhav said that he will visit Ayodhya on 25 November
 jo sawaal aaj main kar rahaa hum, vahiin main ayodhya main piem modi se puuchhuunga
 Do not play with public sentiments
 agar unhone ummid kho di to aapkaa singhaasana mitti main mil jayega
 pms go to many countries but did not visit Ayodhya even once
 modi or fadanvis par nishanashivsena pramukh ne bijepi kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki aapke paas bhagwaan vishnu ke 11wein avatar hai phir bhi aap badhati keemten kyon nahin roak paa rahe hai
 And if you can't stop, why are you in power? He said that even after so many years, no BJP leader has the courage to say that Article 370 should be abolished
 main ghoshnaa karata hum sansad main prastaav lie ham samarthan karenge
 Taking a dig at the Fadnavis government of Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray said that the drought in the state is still under discussion, while Karnataka went ahead and announced a debt waiver
 hamaare mukhyamantri waisi ichhashakti kyon nahin dikhaate? agar sarkaar isapar faisla nahin karegi to ham sarkaar ke khilaaf sadakon par utrenge
 Addressing the rally, Uddhav Thackeray said that he wants to remind that the Hindus of the country are still alive
 jis samay hindutv kii baat koi nahin karata tha tab bala sahib hi the jinhone hindutv kaa udghosh kiya tha
 He said that many people tried to eliminate Shiv Sena
 aaj ham unhen chunauti dete hai, dekhte hai, koun aata he
 The Sangh also started criticizing BJP Uddhav Thackeray said that people say that Shiv Sena speaks against the government, but now the RSS is also speaking
 haal hi main bhaiyyaji joshi ne bolaa he
 The way people ask us, why don't we leave the government? By the way, why don't you ask the RSS too? Let us tell you that at a program in Mumbai, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi of the Sangh raised questions on the BJP government at the center and said that where was the lost service after winning the election? Is gaining power the only objective? Uddhav Thackeray said in his address on # metoo on sexual harassment allegations against men under # metoo campaign that it is serious, it should be investigated and the culprits should be punished severely
 unhone kaha ki mai apni bahanon se apil karata hum ki # metoo, # metoo mat kariye, unhen fouran thappad maariye
 Shiv Sena is with you

 shaadiyon ko gulzaar karne vaala yah kaarobaar rajkumaar taluka or unke bade bhai naval kishor taluka ko unke pita rameshwar laal taluka se viraasat main mila
 The work of expanding it was done by both the brothers with great vigilance
 rajkumaar ke 31 varshiya bete akhil taluka bhi apane pita or taaoo kii tarah hi mehnatee hai
 The impact of his youthful thinking is clearly visible on The Gulmohar
 isaki chat par lage solar panel is baat kaa spasht pramaan hai
 Realizing the importance of energy conservation, he used it in his business
 water harvesting kii soch bhi akhil ke mastishk kii hi upaj he
 Moving from marriage garden to Jaipur, it is a new thing to start a special palatial wedding destination in Jaipur
 rajkumaar kehete hai ki ''da gulmohar" kii shuruyaat ke samay pani kii uplabdhta ko lekar ham sabhi phikrmand the
 The source of water was also required which should not be empty for a long time
 rajkumaar kehete hai, ''mere bete ne iske liye water harvesting kaa suzav diya
 Both of us brothers liked this suggestion very much
 " bina deree kiye taluka bhaaiyon ne is par amal kiya
 Six water harvesting structures were built
 isamen barsaat kaa pani ikattha kiya jaataa he
 Rajkumar remembers that when he started the tent business four decades ago, he used to keep a wash basin made out of steel outside the shop as a signboard of his tent business every morning when he opened the shop
 un dinon tent zyaadaatar sadak ke kinare or kabhi-kabhi ain sadak par hi lagaae jate the
 Naval Kishore was married in this manner
 tent maalik bartan or crockeri bhi muhaiyaa karaate the jinaki ginati bistaron ke saath kii jaati thi
 The remaining items were dumped on the roadside and dumped in garbage
 vah kachra kai dinon tak vahiin sadata rahata tha
 The prince says, "I used to pass that smell very exasperated
" " is badboo se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye unhone gulmohar main kachra nibatane kaa sanyantr lagaaya he
 When people demanded him to provide other wedding related services, he also started catering
 1980 main unhone pramukh sadak prithviraj road par ek rishtedaar se lij par jameen lekar marij garden kii shuruyaat kii
 Marriage garden was a completely new concept by that time
 rajkumaar yaad karte hai, ''meri shaadi ek marij garden main hi hui thi
 "naval Kishore explains that this was a time when people started demanding everything under one roof for marriage and did not want to take the headache of ordering different things at different places
 shaadi se jude duusare kshetron main haath-pair failaana unke liye aasaan sabit hua
 There was a time when the Taluka family provided horses, camels and men for shooting films like mughal-e-azam, Razia Sultan, Gora Kala and James Bond's Octopussy
 yah taluka parivaar kii parkhi najar kaa hi kamaal tha ki unhone duniya ke sabase awwal anke gaye heritage hotel ram baag hotel complex ke ain bheetar shahi baag ke naam se mashhoor sabase beshkeemtee ''marij garden" ko lij par roke rakhaa
 He also serves as decoration for weddings and other events in the second lawn of this prestigious hotel
 ''marij garden" ke liye unke paas lij par ram baag ke saamne ek or jameen bhi he
 Referring to the hyperpile weddings of "gulmohar Marriage Garden" so far, he says that it has so far become the wedding venue of the family of well-known businessmen like the Haldiram Gharana of Nagpur and the daughter of the Chancellor of Jaipur National University
 Marriage has also taken place here
 or bhi kai mashhoor logon kii shaadi ko gulmohar gulzaar kar chukaa he
 Rajkumar says, "it is a matter of comfort for us that all the marriages that have taken place here, they all left from here after being very sainted
 "rajkumaar taluk kehete hai ki haal hi main mukesh ambani ke ghar antilia main ganesh sthapana ke liye saajasja karne kaa avasar mila
 Three years ago, Siddharth Birla also took him to a wedding in Kolkata
 lekin korporate sector main sthapit karne kaa puraa shrey ve piraama healthcare kii sansthaapak swati piraama ko dete hai
 Now the name of Taluka family has become famous in many parts of the country, not only Jaipur
 unke paas udaipur or jodhpur se bhi shaadiyon ke aayojan ke ofer aate hai
 Recently, he is also getting orders from Mumbai, Pune, Goa, Delhi and Kolkata for arranging weddings
 taluka bandhu kehete hai ki sarkaar ko vivaah paryaton ko badhaava dene par vichaar karnaa chahie
 It is a tremendous business today to provide all the arrangements on the occasions of marriage
 isamen log saajasja, khan-paan, gahane, kapade or hotel par khule haathon se kharch karte hai
 There are immense possibilities and opportunities in this business
 yatri kiraaye or malbhaade main badhotaree kii ghoshnaa ke kuch hi ghanton ke bheetar railway ne yah kehete hue shuukravaar ko ise roak diya ki daron main sanshodhan kaa nirnay agali sarkaar karegi
 The railways deferred the decision after facing criticism over the timing of the announcement of increasing fares and freight
 rail mantri mallikarjun khadge ne ek bayaan jari kar railway board ko kiraaya badhaane kaa nirnay agali sarkaar par chhodane kaa nirdesh diya
 The statement issued by the railway said, "it has been reported that on the instructions of Railway Minister Mallikarjun Kharge, the decision on fare hike and freight increase has been pending till further consultation and the proposal in this regard will be placed before the new government
" 'isse pehle, railway ne 20 may se yatri kiraayon main 14
 2 percent and 6 in freight
 5 pratishat vruddhi kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 However, a new notification was later issued stating that from May 20, the fare hike is pending till further consultation
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main upi ke ladakon ke naare, rahul gandhi ke saath saajhe road sho or reliyon ke bich akhilesh yadav kaa ek bada bayaan saamne aayaa he
 On the alliance with the Congress, Akhilesh said that due to a quarrel in the family, the decision of the alliance had to be taken
 haalanki akhilesh ne ye bhi kaha ki sapa-congress gathbandhan se ek sandesh jayega ki pradesh main pradeshik sarkaar kii vaapasi sambhav he
 In an interview to a newspaper, 'rahul and my thinking are alike', Akhilesh Yadav said that if there was no quarrel in the family, then the alliance would not have been decided
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki congress ke saath gathbandhan kaa faisla acha he
 Personal understanding with Rahul Gandhi is also good
 akhilesh ne kaha- ham ek umr ke hai or ek jaise sochate hai
 We want the development of the country and the state
 ham donon ek jaisaa chaahate hai
 What is the thinking about the Congress? Akhilesh also responded to what the SP workers think about an alliance with the Congress
 akhilesh ne kaha ki ham ek saath hai or acchhee samaj rakhte hai
 At first there have been differences between the two parties but today the time has changed
 hamen desh kii dharmanirpekshata ko bachaane ke liye saath khadaa hona he
 The language that PM modi-amit Shah is using threatens the country
 kya gathbandhan main deree hui?congress ke saath gathbandhan ke faisle main deree se jude sawaal par akhilesh ne kaha ki hamen kai faisle antim samay main lene padate hai
 Akhilesh, however, denied that the activists had less time to adjust to the coalition position
 akhilesh ne kaha ki shuruyaat main hamaare parivaar main kuch samasyaayein thi or isamen kaaphi vakt bekaar ho gaya
 This led to a delay in the coalition's decision
 news channelon ke post pole survey se ek baat to saaf ho gai ki desh main endie kii hi sarkaar banegi or bijepi ko samarthan ke liye anya chote dalon ke saamne haath nahin failaana hoga
 This is a matter of relief and because everyone knows the condition of the UPA government formed with the support of various regional parties
 samarthan dene vaale kshetreey dalon ne uski kya keemat vasuuli yah bhi kisi se chupa nahin he
 The Delhi government was as indebted to him as he could recover anything
 kshetreey dalon kii maansikta or variyatayen alag-alag hoti hai
 They are part of the federal structure but their thinking is different
 aisa nahin he ki endie main kshetreey dal nahin hai lekin unki takat bijepi ke majboot hone ke kaaran kahin kam he
 When the major party is large and large then the regional parties are subjugated, they are forced to remain in the government and they cannot stick to their terms
 aise main sarkaar chalaanaa apekshaakrit aasaan hota he
 The post poll survey gives hope that this time the results will be similar
 aise main endie sarkaar sucharu rup se chal sakati he
 Narendra Modi's working style is such that he does not like much interference and it is said about him that the national interest is above all for him and he is not ready to bow down for it
 aise main jaahir he ki takaraav ke halaat paidaa ho sakate the
 Now they have got a good chance to work
 aisa lagata he ki janata unhen bada mandet dene ja rahi he or yah unke liye vardaan jaisaa hoga
 It will also be good for the country that any Prime Minister has the freedom to work, his hands are not tied like we saw in the case of Manmohan Singh
 ek eemaandaar pradhan mantri ke daaman par chhinte isliye bhi pade ki unhen kshetreey dalon kii maangon ke aage jhukna hi padaa
 Due to that, big scams took place
 baharhaal bijepi ko janata se ek bada uphaar milane ja rahaa he
 This will not only make it easier for him to take decisions and the governance of the country will run without any pressure
