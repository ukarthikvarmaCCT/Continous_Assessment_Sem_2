 pakistan ke videsh mantri ne kaha ki agar bharat ko lagata he ki pakistan usko sirf parmaanu hamale kii gidadbhabhaki de rahaa he, to wo aajamaa kar dekh le
 This is not the first time Pakistan has threatened India with a nuclear strike
 isse pehle sitambar 2016 main bhi khwaja asif ne bharat ko parmaanu hamale kii dhamkee di thi
 At that time, Khwaja Asif was the Defense Minister of Pakistan

 It is about to invite a nuclear attack
 agar general ravat kii khwaahish ho, to wo hamaare sankalp (parmaanu hamalaa karne kii dhamkee) kii aajamaaish kar sakate hai

 ''“very irresponsible statement by Indian Army Chief,not befitting his office

 The general's doubt would swiftly be removed, inshallah

 sena pramukh ne yah bhi kaha tha ki loc par pakistan jab bhi sangharsh viraam kaa ulanghan karata he, to ham usko munhtod jawaab dete hai
 We target Pakistan's post from where we think infiltration occurs
 ham chaahate hai ki pakistani sena apni napak harakat kii keemat chukaaye
 Journal Rawat had said that Pakistan would continue to send terrorists
 aap jitne bhi maaroge pakistan phir bhej degaa
 So we determined that the posts of Pakistani Army should be targeted from where the terrorists are getting help
 hamaara makasad pakistani posts ko barbaad karnaa rahaa he, taaki vah dard unako mahasoos kare
 Therefore, the Casualties Pakistan has suffered is three to four times more than us

 chandigarh prashasan ne 14 sadasyitransgender welfareboard kaa gathan karne ke saath use transgenders ke saath kisi bhi tarah ke bhedbhaav ko dur karne ke liye suzav dene ke liye kaha tha
 Two representatives from the transgender community were also involved in the Transgender Welfare Board meeting
 bataa den ki oxford english dictionari ne haal main transgender kii pahchaan darshane ke liye Mx kaa istemaal kiya he
 The transgender community demanded that most application forms have only three options to indicate gender or marital status, whereas transgenders are included in the third gender separately, so a separate option should be provided for them
 chandigarh prashasan ne transgender samudaay kii is maang ko sweekaar karte hue faisla liya he ki sarkari or gaiyr sarkari sabhi aavedanpatron or prarthanapatron main ab Mx kachauthaa vikalpbhi uplabdh hoga

 According to Dhananjay, there should be separate toilets and accommodation for transgenders as no one easily gives a house to the people of this community to rent
 punjab vishvavidhyalay ke transgender chaatr alag se hostel kii maang bhi kar rahe hai
 Explain that about 3000 people of the transgender community live in Chandigarh
 inamen se kai ucch shikshit hai
 About half a dozen transgenders are currently post-graduation students at Punjab University

 Union HRD Minister Kapil Sibal said here today that the Congress has no role in the CBI charge sheet against former Gujarat Minister of State for Home Amit Shah and the court is open to him
 sibbal ne samvaadadatao ke sawaalon ke jawaab main kaha, ‘‘is sambandh main main kya kah saktaa hum, shah ko abhiyukt congress ne nahin banaaya, unke viruddh sibiai ne aarope lagaaya he
 Shah has been accused by the CBI and now whatever he has to say, he should tell before the court
 ’’ bhaajapa dwaara shah ko paak saaf qaraar dene ke bare main unhone kaha ki har party apane netao ke bare main aisa hi kahati he, magar dekhnaa yah he ki adaalat unhen clinit detii he ki nahi
 On the bjp's allegation that the charge sheet had already been prepared against Shah, Sibal said that it is not right to say so
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ham sarkaar main hai, magar hamen iske bare main kuch maaloom nahin he
 They are outside the government and may know more
 ’’ sibbal ne kaha, ‘‘main is vishay main koi tippanee karnaa nahin chahta
 Shah can go to court in this case and can file a petition for bail again
 yah to un par he
 "he said," i don't want to say anything in this matter

 We have nothing to say in this

 isse ek kadam aage badhkar unhone kah daalaa ki jiskaa dil bada hota he, vahiin maaf kiya karte hai
 It is being concluded from this that SP will no longer insist on Beni's dismissal
 gauratlab he ki samaajawaadee party supremeo mulaayam singh yadav isse pehle benny prasad dwaara maafee maangane par ade hue the
 His demand was that if he does not apologize, he should be sacked from the post of minister

 He later reiterated his statement in Parliament, which caused a lot of uproar

 apni pehali film 'student of da year' main fashanparast or ghamandi ladki kaa kirdaar nibhaane ke baad aalia apni duusari film 'haive' main saadi veshbhusha main najar aaengi
 Alia says that she does not mind bold scenes
 aalia ke pita nirmaataa mahesh bhatta 'murder', 'jism', 'raaj' or 'kaliyug' jaisi bold filmon ke liye jane jate hai
 Alia does not find it difficult to do a bold character
 aalia kahati hai, "main 'murder' jaisi film karnaa pasand karuungi
 " 20 varshiya aalia ne ek saakshaatkaar ke dauraan bataaya, "jahaan tak meri simaaon kaa sawaal he, main kisi bhi kirdaar ke liye apana sir nahin mundavaayuungi, lekin jahaan tak bold drishyon kaa sawaal he, mujhe koi aitraaj nahin he
 " aalia apane vyaktigat jivan ko nijee rakhti hai, lekin peshewar faislon main vah apane pita se raay leti hai
 He said, "I do not discuss my personal life with my father, but i discuss a lot with him about my work

 She says, "I have his determination

 His hair has been experimented with in many ways in the film
 shraddha kii noj ring ne bhi unhen jabardast rock star luk diya he

 Earlier, thanks to Nasir Jamshed (106 )'s second consecutive century and Mohammad Hafeez (76 )'s excellent half-century innings, the Pakistan cricket team set a target of 251 runs against India in the second match of the 3-match ODI series in Kolkata
 bharat ne toss jitkar pehle gendbaaji karne kaa faisla kiya
 Pakistan got off to a great start thanks to the excellent innings of Hafeez and Nasser but due to the middle order faltering ahead of tight bowling, they were able to score 250 runs after losing all wickets in the stipulated 50 overs
 chennai main khele gaye pehle vanade mukaable main shatak lagane vaale nasir ne 124 gendon par 12 chauke or do chakke lagaae

 Hafeez's wicket fell at a total of 141 runs
 yah wicket rabindra jadeja ko mila
 On the wickets of Nasir and Hafeez, it seemed that Pakistan would target 290 or 300 in front of India, but the Indian bowlers made a great comeback and gave the visiting team a try for runs

 Alex Hales played a historic innings in the third match of the ongoing ODI series against Pakistan
 unhone england kii taraf se ek pari main sarvaadhik ran banane kaa 23 saal purana record tod diya tha
 Hales scored 171 runs and broke Robin Smith's record of 167 not out against Australia on 21 May 1993 at Birmingham
 unki is pari kii badaulat england vanade main sarvocch score kaa world record todane main bhi safal rahaa
 Even after playing such an important innings, now he is afraid of losing his place in England team
 vastav main helles kaa maananaa he ki yadi vah bangladesh daure se apana naam waapas le lete hai, to unke saath aisa ho saktaa he
 England are scheduled to visit Bangladesh next month after the series against Pakistan
 haalanki is daure par dhaka main july main hue aatanki hamale ke baad se sankat ke badal mandara rahe hai, kyonki khilaadiyon main bhay kaa maahaul he
 Significantly, 20 people were killed in this terrorist attack, most of them foreigners
 ashankaon ko khaarij karte hue england and wales cricket board ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki yah daura tay shedul ke anusaar hi hoga
 The tour will start from October 7, in which 3 odis and 2 Test matches will be played
 gauratlab he ki isaki pushti ECB ke pratinidhimandal ke bangladesh bhraman ke baad kii gai thi
 Now the ball is in the court of England players, because no one can force them for this tour
 sambhawatah isiilie elex helles ko team main apane sthaan par sankat najar aa rahaa he, kyonki daure se hatane par yadi unke sthaan par shaamil kiye gaye kisi anya khilaadi ne acha khel dikhaa diya, to phir helles par sankat aa saktaa he
 However, so far no England player has publicly said anything about going on the tour nor has it been confirmed in this context
 is bich kuch media reporton main yah daawa kiya gaya he ki england ke simit overon ke captain eon morgan un khilaadiyon main shaamil hai, jinhen bangladesh daure main suraksha kii chintaa sata rahi he
 On the other hand, where Alex Hales has a confirmed place in the England ODI team, his performance in the Test has been nothing special
 aise main test main unke liye koi anya ballebaaj khatra ban saktaa he
 The comments helles ne is par baat karte hue kaha, "yadi aap bangladesh nahin jane kaa vikalp chunate hai, to aap team main apane sthaan ko khatre main daalane ja rahe hai
 i am still not sure what to do
 mere liye agle kuch saptahon main liya jane vaala yah sabase kathin faisla hoga

 Dismissing the apprehensions, the England and Wales Cricket Board said last week that the tour would take place as per the schedule
 yah daura 7 oktober se shuru hoga, jisamen 3 vanade or 2 test match khele jaaenge
 Significantly, this was confirmed after the ECB delegation visited Bangladesh
 ab gend england ke khilaadiyon ke paale main he, kyonki unhen is daure ke liye koi baadhya nahin kar saktaa
 Probably this is why Alex Hales sees a crisis in his place in the team, because if any of the other players in his place have shown a good game after being eliminated from the tour, then there could be a crisis for Hales
 haalanki ab tak england ke kisi bhi khilaadi ne daure par jane ko lekar saarvajanik taur par kuch bhi nahin kaha he or na hi is sandarbh main pushti kii he
 Meanwhile, some media reports have claimed that England's limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan is among the players who have been worrying about security during the Bangladesh tour
 duusari ore elex helles kaa england kii vanade team main jahaan sthaan pakkaa he, vahiin test main unka pradarshan kuch khaas nahin rahaa he

 tippaniyan Hales spoke on this, saying, "if you choose not to go to Bangladesh, you are going to risk your place in the team
 main ab bhi is baat ko lekar sunishchit nahin hum ki kya kiya jaae
 This will be the most difficult decision for me to take in the next few weeks
 ' Meanwhile, Hales has now joined players such as Chris Woakes, Josh Butler and Liam Plunkt, who, despite the Australian security expert's security concerns, have refused to make any promises for the tour

 It is easy to express resentment over American drones in politics: on Bush's "goofy" war against terror, which "devastated two countries, Iraq and Afghanistan, and put the third country, Pakistan, on the verge of destruction" 'imran is very angry
 lekin kattarpanthi mullaon se do-do haath karne ke liye khud par or apane majahab par yakeen hona jaruri he
 Imran never concealed his commitment to Islam
 ve apni sthaneey masjid main namaajiyon ke bich apane bete ke saath namaaj adaa karte hai
 At one time, his close friend, the grandson of Shair Iqbal and the heir of a magnificent mansion in Lahore, Yusuf Salahuddin felt that Imran would follow in the footsteps of Fazal Mehmood, the decorated captain of the Pakistan cricket team, who kept a long beard
 Allah began
 magar imran ko dharm ko dharmikata ke taur par dekhne kaa bhram kabhi nahin hua
 They have gradually become the face and voice of a rising Pakistan, which is as much apathetic to the hypocritical mullahs as it is to the American war that has lost all its purpose

 Especially in the media, many of his known and pessimistic colleagues have called Imran stupid, because he is transparent
 ve log jo har baar hazirajvaabi or majaak udaane ke bich main fark nahin kar pate hai, imran ko 'kamajarf im' kahkar unka majaak udaate hai
 When Imran Roshan confides his faith in Jamir (pir), especially those who have declared that they are about to defend their country, they present themselves in front of Danish hatred

 Doing so does not match Imran's character

 (there is no risk of taking Imran of the Establishment in his clutches, as Imran considers Zardari rule as the worst Huku vote in the history of Pakistan

 ve apane aalochakon ko badla lene kaa sukh muhaiyaa nahin karaate; ve emiranaa andaaj vaale gurur ke saath un logon kii andekhi kar dete hai, jisase beshak unka gussa doguna ho jaataa he
 It is not that Imran is of very calm nature

 Luckily, they controlled themselves and our friendship survived

 He said that Azam Khan had crossed all the limits of decency with his statement
 unke is bayaan ke baad lagata he ki vah maansik rup se biimaar hai
 Sushma Swaraj tweeted that Azam Khan is known only for such statements
 unka haalia bayaan bataata he ki vah maansik rup se biimaar hai
 Whatever remarks he made while addressing the Speaker in the House were against the parliamentary decorum
 mujhe lagata he ki unhen is bayaan ke liye kadi se kadi sajaa di jaani chahie
 Such repeated statements by Azam Khan prove that he suffers from mental disorder
 kal sansad main mahila sabhapati ko sambhodhit karte hue diya gaya unka byaan badasluki kii sari hadein paar kar gaya
 Parliamentary decorum demands that Azam Khan be punished severely
 gauratlab he ki ajam khan ke is bayaan ko lekar kai anya mahila saasandon ne bhi apni tikhi pratikriya di he
 In the Lok Sabha, all parties including BJP, Congress, Trinamool Congress, NCP on Thursday slammed Azam Khan's remarks about Presiding Chairman Rama Devi off the party line and demanded the speaker to take stern action in the matter
 is maamle par shoonyakaal main nichle sadan main vibhinn dalon kii mahila saansadon samet dalon ke netaaon ne apni baat rakhi
 The women mps demanded the speaker to take action that could become 'nazir'
 vidhi mantri ravishankar prasad ne kaha tha ki yaa to ajam khan iske liye maafee maange yaa unhen nilambit kar diya jaae
 Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, after hearing the issue of leaders and members of various parties, finally said that he will take a decision in this regard after meeting with leaders of all parties
 loksabhaa sadsy ajam khan ke aacharan par kendriya mantri smriti irani ne kaha ki yah purushon samet sabhi saansadon par ‘‘dhabba'' he
 The whole house has been embarrassed by this incident
 agar aisi ghatana sadan ke baahar hoti to police se sangrakshan maanga jaataa
 He said that by doing something like this, you cannot escape
 yah sirf mahila kaa sawaal nahin he
 You (the speaker) take such action that no one can dare to say such a thing again
 vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha tha ki kal jo ghatana hui vah atyant nindaneey he
 It is not right that a woman reaches such a position with great difficulty and has to suffer such insults
 unhone kaha tha ki hamen raajnneetik sarokaaron se pare hatakar or ekajute hokar iskaa virodh karnaa chahie or sakht se sakht karrwai kii jaani chahie
 Supriya Sule of NCP said that the head bowed in shame after yesterday's incident
 agar is par sahi karrwai nahin kii gai to aane vaali peedi maaf nahin karegi
 He had said that we expect you (the speaker) to take action, take the harshest action, Kalyan Banerjee of Trinamool Congress said that this is an incident which is condemnable
 mahila ke prati chaahe shabd se yaa krity se kisi tarah kaa asammaan bardaasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He had said that during 14 years of exile Laxmanji did not see Sitaji's face
 kal jo baat kahi gai (ajam khan ne) usase mahilaon kii bhaavana aahat hui he
 What happened was not good
 is par karrwai ho
 Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary of the Congress also misunderstood the incident and said that it should be discussed in Parliament's Ethics Committee or Privilege Abuse Committee
 dramuk kii kanimoi ne kaha ki chaahe ham idhar baithe hon yaa udhar baithe hon lekin kal jo ghatana ghati usase sadan kaa apmaan hua he
 She demanded the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill
 bijd ke bhatruhari maahtaab ne kaha ki sadan main spikar ko puri shakti di gai he
 If you want, you can discuss with the leaders of different parties
 yah ghatana maaf karne yogya nahin he
 You asked the member (azam Khan) to apologize again and again but this did not happen
 unhone kaha tha ki is maamle main sakht se sakht karrwai ho
 Significantly, in the Lok Sabha, during the discussion on the bill to prohibit triple talaq, a situation of dispute was created on Thursday when BJP members expressed strong opposition to a comment of Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan regarding the presiding chairman Rama Devi and He had asked for forgiveness
 ajam khan jab ‘muslim mahila (vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan) vidheyak, 2019' par sadan main ho rahi charchaa main bhaag le rahe the to peethasin sabhapati rama devi ne unase asana kii ore dekhakar bolne ko kaha
 On this, Khan made some objectionable remarks which were strongly opposed by the BJP members
 peethasin sabhapati rama devi bhi kehete suni gayin ki yah bolnaa thik nahin he or ise record se hataaya janaa chahie
 He also asked Azam Khan to apologize for this
 infosis pramukh enaar narayan murti ne kaha he ki gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko pachhtaawaa prakat karne kii anumati deni chahie or phir aage bad janaa chahie, anyathaa godhra pashchaat hue dangon ke sandarbh main unke bare main charchaa kabhi samaapt nahin hogi
 During the discussion on an NDTV program, Murthy said that when there is a discussion about a particular person of a party, i say that the reality of the matter should be seen
 jab tak ham yah sweekaar nahin karenge ki hamane kuch kiya, vah sahi nahin tha or jab ham pachhtaawaa prakat karne ko taiyaar hai, to hamen aage badhanaa hoga, anyathaa ham is par anantkaal tak tak bahes karte rahenge
 Murthy neither took Modi's name nor the Gujarat riots
 jab murti se yah poocha gaya ki kya vah bhaajapa ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kaa ullekh kar rahe hai, to unhone iskaa sakaaratmak jawaab diya
 Let me tell you that this news has come from the Congress after the struggle of alliance between Aam Aadmi Party and Congress in Delhi
 ek din pehle congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi (rahul Gandhi) ne twit karke jaankaree di thi ki vah dilli main aam aadmi party (aam Adami Party) sang gathbandhan karne ko taiyaar hai
 Rahul had also ensured that he was ready to give 4 seats in Delhi

 Being ready to give 4 seats in the Lok Sabha elections to be held in 7 seats in Delhi, Rahul Gandhi wrote, "the alliance of Congress and AAP means BJP is eliminated

 ek kitaab ke kuch anshon ko lekar ek purv rajgaraane ke log is kadar gutthamguttha honge, kisi ko andaja bhi na tha
 71-year-old Raghuraj Singh of Bharatpur dynasty's book Rajrajvansha Bharatpur: Parts of untouched memories were so vicious to his nephew Vishvendra Singh and his wife Divya (both former mps) that they attacked Raghuraj Singh's residence
 haalanki hafte bhar baad donon pakshon ke bich phir se sulah ho gai he
 But it did show a bad face of the erstwhile royal family
 bharatpur kaa lakshmivilas pales hotel bhi he or raghuraaj singh parivaar kaa nivas bhi
 Last fortnight, he was worshiping his eldest son here on the eighth anniversary of that when Vishwendra arrived with about 200 people and vandalized and set fire to the entrance, Baradari, etc
 nai inova car bhi jala daali
 Raghuraj Singh's family escaped and saved his life
 1 sitambar kii is ghatana kii pratikriya main jila prashasan ne 5 sitambar ko kitaab par pabandi laga di
 On the same day Vishvendra conducted a Jat mahapanchayat
 isamen ghatana kii ninda karne ke alaava kitaab kii jaanch ke liye ek samiti banaai gai
 The two sides put the matter in police
 is vivaad ke peeche asal main koi khaas vajah nahin he
 Former Chief Minister of neighboring Dhaulpur, former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje released the book in October last year
 vishvendra us aayojan main bulaae nahin gaye the
 Now he went somewhere and looked at the excerpts of the book
 unka etraj is baat par he ki kitaab main 1899 se 1929 tak bharatpur ke shaasha rahe maharaja kishan singh ko apane sainikon kii vardi kharidne ke liye angrejon se karj lete bataaya gaya he
 Also, the ruler made Kishan, who played the bugle, the king
 india today ke paas maujuud prati main lekhak kahata he ki ''kishan singh ne jis tarah se rajya kaa paisa udaaya or jis tarah ve kishan tathaa kuch anya salaahkaaron par nirbhar rahe, usase unhone angrejon kii tauheen kii or rajya ke saath unke rishte kharaab hue
 He has also published a charge sheet, which was given by the British rulers to Maharaja Kishan Singh in 1926
 baad main maharaja ne apane jawaab ke saath is aaropapatr ko ek kitaab kaa hissaa banaaya
 Accusations Nos
 9 to 13 state how the Maharaja gave the title of Raja to Kishan of a poor family, who later started playing bugle in the army
 raghuraaj singh kehete hai ki ''meri kitaab ke byoron se agar kisi kii bhaawanaaon ko thes lagi he to uske liye mujhe khed he
 If the objectionable parts are brought before me, then i will amend
 '' kitaab ke sampadakeey main bharatpur ke emsaje college ke itihaas vibhaag ke dow
 Alok Khanna has written that "the British divide the Raj family of a small state like Bharatpur and Raj Karo did the trick
" ''duusari ore kitaab main vishvendra singh kii is baat ke liye tarif kii gai he ki unhone raajnneeti ko safaltaapurvak apanaaya or aaj bhi use dakshata ke saath chalaa rahe hai
 Yet Vishwendra says that "all parts of it are insulting to us
" '' ise chhapavane ke peeche ve bhaajapa kaa haath dekhte hai
 Vishvendra is known for changing politics and showing tantrums against party leaders
 ab ve kitaab ke chuninda anshon kaa istemaal karke bhaajapa ko nishaanaa banaakar jaaton main apni khoi jameen hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 Ego is his big problem
 ek baar raaje ke bare main unhone kaha tha ki ve bharatpur se chote jat rajya kii maharani rahi hai
 He joined the Congress before the 2008 assembly elections and was defeated by Raje's confidant Digambar Singh
 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress ne unki patni divya kumari ko jaipur (gramin) se tikat dena chaha to ve khud ke liye maangane lage
 Both have since been sidelined since
 divya ke saansad rahete purushon ke phone aane par ve kehete, ''main tumhaari patni ko phone karata hum? tum meri patni ko kyon kar rahe ho?'' raaje kii locarpit kitaab ne unhen phir se aag ko hawa dene kaa mauka muhaiyaa kar diya
 In Bhumi Poojan on Saturday evening in Pune, Prime Minister Narendra Modi thumped his chest and said that by doing demonetisation, he did not fight for corruption, black money, fake notes, terrorism and Naxalism, but only for the liver
 Is teased with
 sava sau karod janata kii aawaaj ko buland karne ke liye unhone ye kathor kadam uthaae hai
 Due to the poor system and loose workings of previous governments, a handful of people have been ruling over 125 crore people so far, they have been arbitrary, with this challenge, Prime Minister Modi said that now it will not be arbitrary
 isliye ve nikal pade he patharile raste par
 'this government is not like the previous governments', clapping earlier, Narendra Modi warned those who tried to hide black money,' Some people felt that it would be like what the previous governments used to be
 thik he kuch din modi bolenge phir kya hoga, phir to ham hi ham hai
 Have been doing this for many years, will do
 ' kisi bank, kisi bank karmchaaree or kisi udyogpati kaa naam liye bagaiyr modi bole, 'unako laga ki bank main daal do, kaala safed ho jayega
 The note did not turn white, his face turned black
 ' bank waalon se saath khel khilne gaye lekinkaale dhanako safed karne ke chakkar main kisi ko munh dikhaane laayak nahin rahe
 'let the white men of black money be careful' Modi then told the people involved in black to white that technology has become so advanced that wrongdoers will be chased to their house
 abhi bhi vakt he, kanoon kaa paalan kiijie, garibo ke haq kaa jo he wo laut dijie
 Modi said that those who are still not ready to improve, even today the rules are such that they can be helped
 sahi raste par aa jaaiye or jindagi bhar chaiyn kii neend so jaaiye
 And if he does not come on the right path then Modi is not going to sleep
 piem ne ishaara diya ki galat kaam karne waalon kaa peechha karenge or unhen salaakhon ke peeche bhejkar rahenge
 Modi said - even after 50 days, the unscrupulous people will increase The problem in Pune, the Prime Minister said that he had already said that fifty days of trouble is going to happen
 unhone yaad dilaate hue kaha ki pachaas din ke baad takalif kuch or badhane vaali he lekin unke liye jo beyimaan hai, eemaandaar logon kii takalif kam hoti jaaegi
 In a pinch, PM Modi said how big babu is going to jail, big people are going to jail, big people of banks have gone home
 lekin jab nikal pade hai to desh ko savaarane ke liye sava sau karod janata ke chahare par hansi , ghar main khushihali laane ke liye ye kathor kadam uthaae hai or nishchit hi wo sunhera din laakar rahenge
 Thanking the people for giving them the opportunity to serve, Modi reminded the people of Pune that during the campaigning for the 2014 assembly elections, he had told the people that the train of progress of Maharashtra has been stuck in the pit for fifteen years, to bring it back on track
 Engine will be needed
 ek dilli kaa ingine or ek maharashtra kaa ingine
 The people of Maharashtra trusted the BJP, Modi, the double engine, the metro came
 to dabl ingine kii takat dekhi aapane ye kahkar modi ne punevasiyon ke jariye maharashtra kaa dhanyavad kiya or bhaashan samaapt kiya
 Some special things about the ceremony: When Modi came, he first met Sharad Pawar and then met people
 bhaashan ke baad bhi pehle sharad pavaar se mili or phir samaaroh sthal se prasthaan kiya
 During his speech, Modi has not taken a dig at Pune city mayor Prashant Jagtap who is a member of NCP party, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reminded the Pune Mayor that after November 8, the Municipal Corporation has 160 properties as property tax
 Crores have been accumulated, this amount can be used properly for the development of the city
 pune main kisi bhi rajkeey samaaroh main aisa swaagat kisi bhi netaa kaa nahin hua tha, maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke anurodh par sabhi pachis hajaar jaan samudaay ne ek saath apane mobile kaa flash lite shuru karke chamakaate hue piem modi kaa kiya swaagat, aise lag rahaa maano dharti par taare jagamaga rahe ho

 haathaa-pai ke dauraan pradarshnakariyon ne bhansaali ko thappad bhi maar diya
 Karni Sena says that he has objections to the love scene allegedly being filmed between Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmavati
 deepika padukon or ranvir singh ke saath hi shahid kapur ne bhi is vishay par apni raay rakhi he
 Let us know that since morning the entire Bollywood industry was getting strong reactions against this incident, but no member of this film of Bhansali had given any opinion on this incident
 yahaan tak kii is ghatana ke baad khud sanjay lila bhansaali ne apni koi pratikriya nahin di he
 Deepika Padukone tweeted, 'I am in shock right now

 In another tweet, Deepika wrote, 'being Padmavati, i can assure that there is no tampering of history in this film

 The country will not see more new or privately developed cities in the near future, as most efforts are focused on reorganizing existing urban areas

 Addressing the inaugural session of a conference here, Devroy said, 'I think that will be the specific case, while India will look at a fully privately funded city

 Nor will it happen when completely new cities are seen

 ' devroy kaa maananaa he ki '2001 se 2011 ke dauraan shaharikaran main aadhi vruddhi puraane shaharon main hui he, jisase apni tarah ke sanchaalan kii samasya paidaa hui he
 He said that 'urbanization in India has been somewhat chaotic
 isaki yojana behatar tareeke se nahin banaai gai
 Mostly when we complain about the nature of urbanization, less efficient use of resources, this is mainly related to poor management of urbanization
 ' Talking about public private partnership, he said, 'I hate the expression of PPP
 isamen bahut adhik log bahut kuch karte hai jab ve pipipi kaa istemaal karte hai

 After Congress President Ahul Gandhi Germany, he is now in Britain and from there has been continuously attacking the Modi government at the Center
 landonamen bhartiya patrakaron se baat karte hue rahul ne kaha ki piem modi kisi sawaal kaa jawaab nahin dete, jabaki vah khud risk lete hai or galati karte hai
 Rahul Gandhi once again attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an event organized at the Indian Journalists Association (IJA) in London, saying, 'has Prime Minister Modi ever surfaced and he answered the questions
 main risk letaa hum or galati kar saktaa hum, lekin main sikh saktaa hum kyonki mere liye risk kii tulana main baat karnaa behad ahm he
 Attacking Modi, he said that the Prime Minister does not take any kind of feedback from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs
 vah videsh mantrisushamaa swarajki andekhi kar rahe hai
 Sushma Swaraj is a fully capable woman, but she is not being used to the fullest
 unhen apamaanit kiya ja rahaa
 She does not even appear in a picture with him
 rahul gandhi ne sawaal daagate hue kaha ki kya kisi videsh mantri kaa kaam sirf vija banavaane tak hi simit rahata he
 He said that the Prime Minister went to Afghanistan, then to Pakistan but he has no answer on what happened

 We do not even know how long it will take

 lekin taaja hinsak ghatana ne ek baar donon deshon ke bich sambandh par sawalia nishaan laga die hai
 According to the report released by the National Bomb Data Center, there have been more bomb blasts in India in 2016 than in Afghanistan and Iraq
 2016 main bharat main kul 406 blast kii ghatnaayen hui, in ghatnaon main IED or ordinance explosive blast bhi shaamil hai
 According to the report, there have been around 221 incidents in Iraq, Iraq being the area affected by the war
 haalanki jari kii gai list main ghatnaon main hui mauton kaa byora nahin diya gaya he
 The NBDC acts as the nodal agency of the NSG to investigate the blast, according to the report that the central government has gathered these data through open source
 pakistan kaa doosraa numberreport ke anusaar blast kii ghatnaon main pakistan kaa number doosraa he
 In 2016, there are a total of 161 bomb blast incidents in Pakistan
 vahiin afghanistan main 132, turki main 92, thailand main 71, south africa main 63, siria main 56 blast kii ghatnaayen saamne ain hai
 There have been 42 incidents in Egypt and 29 in Bangladesh
 aankado main bharat kii ghatnaayen- 406 main se 337 ghatnaayen IED blast kii huin- 69 ghatnaayen ordinance explosive se hui- jammu-kashmir main 31 ghatnaayen IED se hui, burhan vaani kii maut ke baad badi ghatnaayen Petrol-diesel prices are setting new records every day
 mumbai mempetrolki keemten 90 rupee prati litre ke str ke paar hai to rajdhani dilli main petrol 80 rupee prati litre ke str ke upar bik rahaa he
 In such a situation, there is a big pressure on the state governments, including the central government, to cut their tax rates so that petrol and diesel can be sold at a normal price to provide relief to the common man
 lekin aisa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Actually, the formula for determining the prices of petrol and diesel is constantly being questioned
 in sawaalon ke bich kendra sarkaar apane rajasav ko hone vaale nuksaan ke chalate katautee karne se manaa kar rahi he to rajya sarkarein apni kamai kaa sabase bada jariye ganvaane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai
 More than half of the price of petrol and diesel is taxed by the central and state governments
 yahi kaaran he ki mumbai main petrol 90 rupee prati litre ke str par pahunchane vaala he or dilli main 80 rupee ke str par bik rahaa he
 However, if we look at the formula for determining the prices of petrol and diesel, it is clear that the government is earning a lot from these taxes
 is formule ke aise paksh bhi hai jahaan sarkaar samet tel companiyon ko doharaa phayda bhi ho rahaa he jise arthshaastra kii bhashaa main windfall gen kah sakate hai
 Due to both these advantages, as the price of crude oil rises globally, the level of profit of companies making and selling petrol and diesel in the country, including the central and state governments, increases
 35 rupee litre petrol bechnaa chaahate hai ramdev, sarkaar se maangi ijajatbharat main petrol-dijal kaa aayaat nahin kiya jaataa
 Import is done only of crude oil
 lekin desh main petrol-dijal kii bikri ke liye petrol-dijal ke aayaat rate ko chunaa jaataa he
 If the government had imported petrol and diesel directly instead of crude oil, which is the raw material for preparing petrol and diesel, then adding the excise and VAT of the central and state governments at that rate would add petrol and diesel in the country
 The rate to sell is fixed
 petrol-dijal ke rate ko tay karne ke is formula ko emport parity price kaha jaataa he
 It is worth noting that till 2002, the cost-plus formula was used to determine the price of petrol and diesel in the country
 is formule ke tahat kendra sarkaar lambii avadhi main kachche tel kii kharid par kharch nikaalte hue petrol-dijal ke ritel rate ko nirdhaarit karti thi
 The biggest criticism of this formula, however, was that there was a lack of transparency in determining the price of petrol and diesel
 vahiin eport parity price main paardarshita adhik he
 Therefore, in 2002, the price of petrol and diesel was deregulated and handed over to the market
 iske baad nai formule kii samiksha 2006 main si rangarajan cameti ne kiya or eport parity price ko sahi tarika bataaya
 If there is a continuous increase in the price of crude oil in the import parity price, then obviously the prices of petrol and diesel will be increasing
 aisa isliye ki kachche maal main ijaphe se utpaada kii keemat main adhik ijapha hota he
 The government gets more tax on petrol and diesel and oil companies increase the price of the product after the increase in raw material
 iske alaava desh kii sarkari or nijee kshetra kii tel rifinary companiyaan badi maatra main niryaat hone vaale petrol-dijal par badi kamai karte hai
 The revenue of the oil companies also increases the revenue of the central government
 aankadon ke mutabik petrol-dijal rifining main reliance industries kaa tex ke baad jahaan 2015-16 main 11,242 karod rupee kaa munafa hua vahiin 2017-18 ke dauraan yah munafa badhkar 21,346 karod par pahunch gaya
 At the same time, the profit after tax of the state refinery company Indian Oil increased from Rs 22,426 crore to Rs 33,612 crore during this period
 gauratlab he ki yadi kendra sarkaar petrol-dijal kii keemat kaa aankalan karne ke liye petrol-dijal kii emport parity price kii jagah kachche tel se petrol-dijal banane main laagat, tex or munafa ko jodakar nirdhaarit kare to aam aadmi ko petrol-dijal ke raste ne vaali manhagaai kii maar se bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Shiv Sena has said in 'saamana' that this is the politics of shamelessness Shiv Sena has said - Shiv Sena has taken a dig at the political upsurge of Ajit Pawar's 12 hours in Maharashtra on Saturday
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne rashtravaadi congress party (ensipi) netaa ajit pavaar ke saath milakar sarkaar bana to lee lekin ab sarkaar gathan ke liye vidhayakon kaa samarthan hasil karnaa bada sawaal bana hua he

 By late evening, 40 of the 54 NCP mlas stood firmly with Sharad Pawar till late in the evening, which made it clear that poor Ajit Dada Pawar is badly stuck with just 3 mlas, to get him to recover
 Is impossible

 baithak main ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar or varisht netaaon ke saath hi vidhayak shaamil hue
 He was given other rights along with issuing whip to the legislators, which were withdrawn with immediate effect
 ab unki jagah par jayant patil koencipika nayaa netaa chunaa gaya he or unhen anya nirnyon ke liye adhikrut kiya gaya he
 Ajit Pawar was elected as the Leader of the Assembly on 30 October
 maharashtra chunaav parinaam 24 oktober ko ghoshit hue the
 Earlier, party chief Sharad Pawar had said in the morning about the formation of the government with the BJP, the NCP strongly opposes it
 yah party ke khilaaf uthaaya gaya kadam he or ajit pavaar ne party anushaasan kii dhajjiyaan uda di hai
 When the Sri Lankan team will face the West Indies in the ICC T20 World Cup title match on Sunday, the only challenge for them will be to curb 'run machine' Chris Gayle

 Both teams are well aware that Gayle's form can prove to be decisive in the match

 It is not that if winning, all the problems of Caribbean cricket will go away, but winning the tournament will encourage the youth

 This victory will also give Sammy a chance to breathe a sigh of relief

 dilli ke ek makaan main lobby main 32 maheene tak ek laash dabi rahi
 Neither the families came to know
 na padosiyon ko bhanak lagi, or na hi police ko isaki khabar thi
 This corpse became a skeleton
 lobby main jis jagah par laash dabi thi uske upar tulsi ke paudhe lahalha rahe the
 No one was at all convinced that the secret of a murder is buried under this ground
 phir ek din aisa hua kimrderki ye kahani sabake saamne aa gai
 This sensational story of the murder is from Dabri area of delhi
 yahaan kiraaye ke ek makaan main ek mamaa-bhaanja rahete the
 Something happened between the two that Mama Vijay killed nephew Jai Prakash
 bhaanje ko maarane ke baad is shaks ne ek behad shaatir plan banaaya
 This man had buried the corpse in the lobby of the house with some chemical that his bad smell did not come out
 iske liye usne pehle balakani main kareeb dedh feet tak mitti daali
 Spread bricks on him
 phir ded body ko rakhkar use mitti se dhakaa
 For the sake of suspicion, the corpses put pots above
 saath hi tulsi ke paudhe lagaae die taaki kisi ko shaq naa ho
 Accused Vijay also buried the jacket of nephew Jai Prakash here
 jurm kii har dastaan kii tarah katl kii ye vaardaat bhi hajaar koshishon ke baavjood dafan nahin hui, or ek din kabr todakar saamne aa gaya bhaanje ko wo kankal jisane apane kaatil mamaa kii darindagi kaa puraa kaccha-chittha khol diya
 Actually a month ago a girl came to live in this house on rent
 kuch din baad ladki ne makaan maalik se kahkar apni balakani main gril lagane ko kaha
 When the work started in the lobby to install the grill, the workers removed the pot and started digging the soil kept here
 jiske baad mitti se ye kankal baahar aayaa
 The workers immediately reported the incident to the contractor
 iske baad police ai or maukey se namak kii teen boriyaan or gadde ke saath kambal main lipte kankal ko baraamad kiya
 It is said that this incident of murder is in February 2016
 aaropee mamaa kaa naam vijay kumaar maharana he, 35 saal kaa ye shaks andhra pradesh kaa rahanevaala he
 This man worked in a company in Gurugram
 24 saal kaa bhaanja jai prakaash uske saath rahata tha
 MBA pass Jai Prakash also worked in a private company in Gurugram
 jai prakaash ke gharavaalon ke mutabik 6 farvari 2016 ko unki aakhri usase baat hui thi
 On 7 February, the accused maternal uncle had told that he had gone to Vaishno Devi with his friends
 lekin kai dinon tak jab jai prakaash kii koi khabar nahin mili to dabaav badhane par aaropee mamaa ne hi 12 farvari dabadi thane main gumshudagi kaa maamla darj karavaaya
 Jayaprakash's mother has identified the body of her son based on his clothes
 vaardaat ke kareeb dhai saal baad bhi police ye nahin pataa laga pai ki jai prakaash kahaan he? uske saath kya hua? uski hatya kyon kii gai? aaropee mamaa kaaphi dinon se hi faraar he
 Now the challenge before the Delhi Police is to catch him and find out why Vijay murdered Jayaprakash? hamaare desh main kehete hai ki 'mehmaan bhagwaan samaan hota he' team india ke 'honhaar' gendbaaj ishanth sharma ne is kahawat ko kuch zyada hi gambhirtha se le liya
 And, taking care of the guests, gave them the victory of their own team
 aisa karne ke liye bada dil chahie or ishanth ne mohali main khele gaye 7 maichon kii vanade siries ke tisare match main gajab kii dariyaadilii dikhaai
 Dhoni showed why Captain Cool, Australia had won the toss and invited Team India to bat, since then the problems of the hosts started
 154 ranon tak 6 wicket ganvaa chuki thi team india
 But Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni once again proved that he is not called as 'captain Cool'
 puchhlle ballebaajon ke saath milakar dhoni ne team india kaa score 50 overon main 303 tak pahunchaaya, wo bhi tab jab 250 ran bananaa bhi mushkil dikh rahaa tha
 Dhoni returned unbeaten after scoring 139 runs playing the captaincy innings
 lekin unhen jaraa bhi andaja nahin tha ki unke tej gendbaaj ishanth is pari ko apni gendbaaji se jaaya kar denge
 Ishant was the hero of the Kangaroos' victory! Even though Man of the Match James Faulkner has been chosen, the real victory of the guests is Ishant Sharma
 chaunkiye mat, ishanth kaa aathvaan over dekhakar to bilkul aise hi laga tha ki wo kangaaroon ko jeet dilaane ke liye ji tod koshish kar rahe hai
 There was a time when Ishant proved to be a 'threat' to former Australian captain and veteran batsman Ricky Ponting
 is match main aisa lag rahaa tha ki wo apni gendbaaji se australian team ko jeet kaa tohfa dena chaahate the or saath hi panter (ponting kaa niknem) se maafee maangana chaahate the
 Now Punter will forgive Ishant, but it will be a matter of seeing what Captain Cool of Team India does with Monsieur
 
 
 jab ishanth ne kangaaroon ke 'paksh' main phenkaa overteam india ke 304 ranon ke lakshya ke saamne australian team ko aakhri ke 3 overon main 44 ranon kii darkaar thi
 14

 Amit Shah is the director of this bank

 In this case, the Election Commission has found some documents

 chunaav ayog ke anusaar tay seemaa se zyada kharch karne par sambandhit ummidavaar ke khilaaf sakht karrwai kii jaaegi
 According to the Commission Rules, if a candidate wins even after spending more and later confirms the violation of the spending limit, the Commission can take action by canceling the membership of the winning candidate and declaring the second-ranked candidate as the winner, ie here There is a provision to take action till isse pehle chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi sani deol par kathith rup se adarsh aachaar samhita kaa ulanghan kaa aarope laga tha, jiske baad chunaav ayog ne unhen notice jari kiya tha

 com / khmocwlut2— Jasprit bumrah (@jaspritbumrah93)november 17, 2017 Voting was held on Monday in Bhiwandi Lok Sabha seat of Maharashtra as part of the fourth phase of voting
 chunaav ayog se praapt taaja aankadon ke mutabik, bhiwandi loksabhaa seat par 52
 The turnout was 69 percent
 vahiin maharashtra main 56
 54 percent voting was recorded
 is seat par bijepi ne maujuuda saansad kapil patil ko phir tikat diya he
 While the Congress has nominated former MP Suresh Tawde
 is seat par congress or bijepi ke bich sidhaa muqabla he
 According to Election Commission data, a total of 15 candidates are in the fray for this seat
 maharashtra kii bhiwandi loksabhaa seat par saal 2014 main 51
 07 percent voting was done, whereas in the earlier 2009 elections here only 39
 40 fisadi vot pade the
 The history of the seat came into existence in 2008 after delimitation of Maharashtra's Bhiwandi Lok Sabha seat
 iske baad yahaan pehla chunaav 2009 main hua
 If you look at the figures, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Kapil Patil of BJP won the election here
 unhen 4,11,070 vot hasil hue the
 He defeated Vishwanath Patil of Congress
 unhen 3,01,620 vot hasil hue the
 At the same time, Suresh Mahatre of MNS finished third
 unhen 93,647 vot mili the
 Let us tell that due to a triangular contest in Bhiwandi seat, no single party can win unilaterally
 pichley kuch chunaav se yahaan congress or bijepi kaa khel manase bigaadti rahi he
 a similar equation was confused in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 yahaan congress ke suresh taavare chunaav jite the
 He received 1,82,789 votes
 taavare ne bijepi ke jagannatha patil ko chunaav haraaya
 Patil received 1,41,425 votes
 vahiin, tisare sthaan par rahe devraj maharaatre unhen 1,07,090 vot mili the
 How to change Bhiwandi's equation
 
 
 
 Bhiwandi seat in Thane district was a part of Dahanu Lok Sabha constituency before delimitation
 dahanu se alag hone ke baad bhiwandi main wo teen vidhansabha ai jahaan bijepi kaa dabadabaa rahaa
 This is the reason why BJP has kept this seat with them after alliance with Shiv Sena
 maaloom ho ki 1999 main bijepi ke chintaman vanagaa ne dahanu loksabhaa seat par congress ke di em shingda ko haraaya
 Since then, bjp's dominance in Dahanu has increased
 lekin parisemen ke baad jin ilaakon main bijepi kaa dabadabaa tha unamem se teen vidhansabha seat jawahar, dahanu or igatpuri bhiwandi loksabhaa se cat gai
 The effect of which also appeared in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections in Bhiwandi
 yahaan bijepi kii haar hui congress ke suresh taavare jite
 While Jagannath Patil of BJP had to face defeat
 kya he vidhansabha siton kii sthiti
 
 
 The Congress and NCP have always dominated the 6 assembly seats of Bhiwandi Lok Sabha seat
 lekin pichley kuch chunaav se yahaan shivasena or bijepi ne dam bharaa he
 The equations have changed here in the last assembly election
 bhiwandi gramin or bhiwandi east vidhansabha par shivasena kaa raaj he
 So Bhiwandi West, Kalyan West and Murbad are ruled by BJP
 jabaki ensipi yahaan kii shahpur seat par kabiz he
 SP SP, which came together in UP by-elections, has taken steps towards ending all the distances of the alliance
 sapa-basapa ne is baar 14 april ko bade str par baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar kii jayanti manaane kii yojana banaai he
 However, SP has been celebrating his birthday in a symbolic manner every year till now
 jabaki basapa bade jashn ke saath manaati rahi he
 After the sp's victory in the by-elections with the support of the BSP in the recent by-elections, the SP has decided to openly show love and respect for Ambedkar
 isi ke maddenjar sapa alaakaman ne pradesh kii sabhi jila ikaayiyon ko ambedkar jayanti ko bade str par manaane kaa nirdesh die hai
 Let SP Ambedkar love that on April 14, the SP has usually done the same by paying floral tributes every year
 is baar baba sahib ke janmdin ko party khaas banane ja rahi he
 SP has planned to connect every worker with this program
 sapa dow
 The short film on Ambedkar will be shown in every district
 iske alaava unke jivan par bani kitaab vitarit karegi
 It is also organizing seminars in all districts
 sapa itane bade str par pehali baar kaarykram kar rahi he
 The Samajwadi Party's move is seen as a second attempt to create an atmosphere after the alliance with the BSP
 ambedkar jayanti par basapa kaa planbspi supremeo mayawati har saal ambedkar park main jaakar unhen shradhanjali detii hai or apane cader ko sambodhit karti hai
 This time in Baba Saheb's birthday, the BSP will do different programs in the districts apart from these programs, in which the big leaders of the party will join different districts
 haalanki, sapa-basapa donon partiyaan alag-alag tarah se 14 april ko baba sahib kaa janmdin manaaengi
 But this time both the parties do not want to look behind the BJP in the event of Babasaheb's birthday
 isiilie donon partiyon ne bade str par kaarykram banaae hai
 Ambedkar Prem Gaur of BJP says that on this day, Prime Minister Modi will try to give a big message to the Dalits across the country who will live in the Dalit and tribal area of chhattisgarh
 bijepi ke tamaam kaaryakartaaon ko bade str par ise manaane ke nirdesh die gaye hai, saaf he ki chunavi saal se pehle baba sahib ke janmdin par siyaasi partiyon ne apni siyasat ke liye is aayojan ko bade str par manaane kii ranneeti banaai hai
 Hindi cinema has once again made the audience crazy, the reason is Pink
 har kisi kii jubaan par shujit sarkaar kii film 'pink' kii charchaa he
 It is said to be the first Bollywood film in which the untold aspect of women has been empowered for the first time
 film relies ke samay jab film ke nirmaataa shujit sarkaar se poocha gaya ki unhone is film kaa naam 'pink' kyon rakhaa to unhone kaha, 'jab log unki yah film dekhenge to unhen khud pataa chal jayega ki yah naam kyon rakhaa gaya he
 Then we all speculated that its name may be related to Pinkinkler, which is generally considered to be the color of girls
 par sachai kuch or he
 Shoojit Sarkar is not only known for making the best films, but he also keeps the name of each of his films in which deep meaning is hidden
 'pink' naam rakhane ke peeche unki soch kaaphi alag thi
 On toi's blog, Viresh Malik has elaborated that why the film is named 'pink'? He wrote, 'in many dictionaries, Pink has to make a physical relationship with a woman, either by force or by cruel or intimidating
 'unhone isaki ek or vyakhya di he
 In many countries, Pink is such an abuse, which means to physically force a woman
 to ab aapako pataa chalaa naa ki aakhir film kaa yah naam kyon he or kyon script ke hisaab se yah naam bilkul sateek he

 modi ko lekar yashavanth sinha kaa virodh yaheen nahin rukaa
 He then took a jibe at Modi's statements and said that instead of the useless rhetoric, you should talk on issues that are directly related to the public

 When Sinha was asked that the things you are saying, his conclusions are being drawn that this is an advice for Modi
