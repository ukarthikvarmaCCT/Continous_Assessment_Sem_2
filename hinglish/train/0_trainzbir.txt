 Kiku had taken part in Jhalak as an eyelid
 gaurav kehete hai, 'jab maine bataurachutkiparform karne ke liye haa kii thi, us samay mujhe nahin pataa tha ki main kya karne ja rahaa hum
 Playing a woman and dancing as a woman are both different things, and i realized this during rehearsals

 The one who has the best degrees in the world, why could he not teach his religious wife to read and write? The question is deep and think of it with a cold breath

 Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb has been in the limelight for his statements
 wo kabhi mahabharat kaal main internet hone kii baat karte hai, to kabhi yuvaaon ko paan kii dukaan kholane kii salaah dete hai
 Now he has given a statement about Gautam Buddha, which is a topic of discussion in political circles
 bijepi netabiplab debane kaha ki gautam buddha ne bharat, burma, japan, tibet or anya deshon kii paidal yatra kii thi
 Due to these statements, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also summoned Biplab Deb, but still he is not refraining from his rhetoric
 telegraph kii khabar ke mutabik biplab deb ne kaha, ''yahaan ham buddha jayanti manaa rahe hai
 Gautama Buddha gave the message of peace and unity
 iske liye unhone puure bharat, burma (myanmar), japan, tibet or anya deshon kii paidal yatra kii
 India is such a land where a king becomes a Buddhist monk and gives a message of peace to the whole world
 ''tripura ke mukhyamantri ne kaha ki buddha ne bharat kii mahaan parampara or samskruti kaa prachaar kiya
 They respect this tradition
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki har koi miljul kar shanti va sauhaard se rahe or gautam buddha dwaara dikhaae gaye maarg kaa anusaran karen
 He also appealed to the people to celebrate Buddha Purnima
 vahiin, itihaaskaaron ne biplab kumaar deb ke bayaan se asahmati jataai he
 At the same time, it is feared that whether or not Gautam Buddha has traveled as much as Biplab Deb is telling? Subhash Ranjan Chakraborty, a former professor of history at Presidency University, Kolkata, says that the countries Biplab Deb has mentioned , Gautama Buddha never visited there in his lifetime
 haalanki gautam buddha ke kaaphi samay baad unke anuyaayiyon ne in deshon main buddha dharm kaa prachaar-prasar kiya tha yani burma, japan, tibet samet anya deshon main anya bhikshuon ne buddha dharm ko pahunchaaya
 At the same time, Additional Secretary of Tripura Milind Ramteke has defended the statement of Nebiplab Deb
 milind ne kaha ki gautam buddha ne tatkaaleen bharatvarsh kii paidal yatra kii thi or shanti kaa sandesh diya tha, jo aaj ke burma, japan or tibet main pahunchaa
 He said that Chief Minister Biplab Deb's statement on Gautam Buddha is completely correct based on historical facts
 iske saath hi unhone media par biplab deb ke bayaan ko tod-marod kar pesh karne kaa aarope madha
 Earlier in the Mahabharata period, Biplab Deb has been involved in controversies by talking about the Internet and advising the youth to open a paan shop and raise a cow
 iske alaava unhone bharat kii pehali miss world par sawaal uthaakar bhi vivaad paidaa kiya tha

 Where two senior BJP leaders Sushil Modi and Nand Kishore Yadav were seen once again standing in support of Nitish Kumar
 vahiin kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne nitish kumaar kaa khulkar virodh kiya, jo raajnneetik taana bana pichley ek maheene se bunana shuru kiya tha
 He played his opposition cards openly again in the name of criticism of the government
 isamen unhen bihar ke nagar vikaas mantri suresh sharma or bihar bhaajapa ke nav niyukt adhyaksh sanjay jaisawal kaa bhi saath mila
 However, Suresh Sharma teased the 'officers did not listen to me'

 Suresh Sharma knows that everyone is questioning his ability due to water logging, so he felt safe to stand behind Giriraj Singh

 Through this statement, he tried to end the doubt about the future of the alliance among the party workers
 lekin janata dal united ke netaaon ko ab is baat kaa puraa ehsaas ho gaya he ki nitish kumaar par giriraaj singh lagaataar nishaanaa saadh rahe hai, or bhaajapa kaa ek tabaka(jisamen sheersh netritv bhi shaamil he) unhen uski maun sahmati mili hui he
 In the coming day, some sort of excuse will be tried to show them down and fail
 unhen yah bhi ehsaas ho gaya he ki unke raajnneetik virdohi se zyada unke sahyogi gut kii taraf se hi nitish kumaar kii aalochana kii jaaegi
 However, BJP leaders also believe that it is a political advantage for Nitish Kumar that the caste from which his critics come, is as vocal and aggressive as the Nitish supporters
 doosraa janata dal united ke mantri or pravaktaa jis aakraamakata se ab nitish ke bachaav main aa gaye hai, usase bhi unki taraf se sandesh saaf he ki philhal sarkaar chalaane ke liye apane netaa ke upar bevajaah aalochana wo bardaasht nahin karenge
 Leaders of Janata Dal United say that there has been a flaw on the part of the officer, but insulting all its officers by standing in the dock is also the beginning of a wrong tradition for those sitting in the government

 In Maharashtra, the bjp-shiv Sena alliance has got 161 seats, while the congress-ncp has managed to get 98 seats
 pichhali baar bhaajapa-shivasena gathbandhan ko vidhansabha main 185 siten mili thim
 Looking at the results, it shows that this time the alliance has lost 24 seats
 bhaajapa-shivasena main kadi takkarmote taur par bhaajapa-shivasena ko teen partiyon ne rajya main kadi takkar di- congress, uski sahyogi rashtravaadi congress party or is baar chunaav main nai ai prakaash ambedkar kii party vanchit bahujan aghadi (vibie)
 The congress-ncp, which got the status of Opposition, had to be satisfied with 98 seats this time, while the deprived Bahujan Aghadi could not win a single seat
 in nateezon ke vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki yadi in chunaavon main vibie congress-ensipi ke saath haath mila leti to maharashtra main bhi haryana kii tarah trishankuvidhansabhaban jaati, jisamen sarkaar banane ke liye kisi ke bhi paas bahumat na hota
 For its analysis, the India Today Data Intelligence Unit analyzed all the seats where the BJP won and added the percentage of votes that Congress / NCP and VBA received in those seats
 in teenon partiyon ke vot share jodne ke baad pataa chalaa ki aisi lagbhag 34 siten hotin jahaan teen kii shakti jeet jaati or bhaajapa ko haar milti
 Due to this, the congress-ncp-vba would have got less than the majority but almost (138) seats and the BJP would have reduced to 128
 aise main sarkaar banane ke liye kisi bhi ek party yaa gathbandhan ke paas paryaapt aankade maujuud na hote

 But everyone knows about Mahatma Gandhi, so after the formation of the party government under the leadership of Narendra Modi, there was a successful attempt to bring Gandhi to his side as symbols
 uske baad yah sochaa gaya ki doosraa pratik kya ho saktaa he, to babasaheb bhimrao ambedkar kaa naam aayaa or hamane yah sandesh dena tay kiya he ki ambedkar kisi samudaay vishesh ke nahin balki sabhi ke netaa the
 In this episode, now we have to make inroads in West Bengal, then its way is to step forward by taking a veil from the mystery that has remained so far regarding Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose
 '' bijepi ke ek netaa kii yah tippanee samudaayon ke pratikon ke jariye bijepi kii bhavishya kii rajnatik soch ko ujagar karti he
 In fact, the BJP and the Sangh Parivar realize that people of all sections of the society came to BJP due to disillusionment with their regional leaders in the Modi wave
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke mukaable 2014 ke aam chunaav main bijepi ke dalit vot bank main doguna ijapha hua or pehali baar bijepi 282 siton ke bade janadesh ke saath satta main baithi
 Certainly, people have broken away from other parties, so the Sangh Parivar has formulated a comprehensive policy to join the Dalits on which work has been started strategically
 iskaa aagaaj sangh or bijepi ne ambedkar kii 125veen jayanti ke maukey par desh bhar main 300 se zyada kaarykram yojit kar daliton ke maseehaa maane jane vaale babasaheb ko apana banane kii aakraamak niti par amal karke kiya he
 How the BJP came on the agenda of the Ambedkar Lok Sabha elections, the Dalit votes had a major contribution in the mandate given to the BJP
 2009 main bijepi ko dalit bahul vaale ilaake kii 21 siten mili thim to 2014 main yah badhkar 73 ho gayi
 Therefore, the BJP focused on the strategy of joining these new voters
 bijepi netaaon kaa maananaa he ki bhale vikaas kii baat ho rahi he, lekin in sabhi votaron ko naukari yaa koi sidhaa laabh nahin pahunchaaya ja saktaa
 Hence the party pushed forward the strategy of conveying through symbols
 ambedkar kii jayanti pehle bijepi kaa essi morcha yojit karata tha, lekin is baar party kii mukhya team ne sidhe kaman sanbhali
 Udit Raj, a Dalit leader and a BJP MP for the first time, sees Ambedkar's rise in the party's agenda in a philosophical manner, "when you wake up, then
 bijepi ko bhi laga ki dow
 The struggle and the ultimate goal of Ambedkar was also the thinking of the BJP
 '' unka kahana he ki dalit samaaj se ubhare madhya varg, buddhijivi or adhikari varg kii maarak kshamta ko party ne dekha or yah ambedkar kii vajah se janaadhar badhaane kii koshish he
 But he considers the book "the Worthing of Falls God" written by BJP leader and former Union Minister Arun Shourie against Ambedkar as a major reason for bjp's defeat in 2004
 unka kahana he ki jis tarah jaswant singh ko jinna par kitaab likhane ke liye party se nikaal kar sandesh diya gaya tha, shouri ke maamle main bhi party ko us vakt usee tarah kaa rukh dikhaanaa chahie tha
 However, Union Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Thawarchand Gehlot says, "bjp's thinking is positive and we have been giving respect to Ambedkar since the time of Jana Sangh
 lekin mujhe dukh he ki aaj log ise charchaa kaa vishay bana rahe hai
 "but Sanjay Paswan, a minister in the Vajpayee government and president of the BJP SC Morcha, does not hesitate to say that the party's strategy is to block the vote of the Ambedkarites in the elections
" ve kehete hai, ''congress ne apana khoyaa aadhaar hasil karne ke liye ambedkar par abhiyaan kii baat kii to bijepi peeche kyon rahati
 Our aim is to stop the Congress
 '' haalanki unka maananaa he ki ambedkar ko party ke mukhya agenda par laane main dalit netaaon kaa dabaav rahaa he
 "but his comments on Shourie's book are also strong and he says that it should also be seen on which side Shourie is standing in the party today
" haalanki ambedkar ko pramukhataa die jane kii bijepi kii ranneeti par mahatma gandhi antarrashtriya hindi vivi main buddha adhyayan vibhaag ke prabharee nideshak dow
 Surjeet Kumar Singh questions
 ve kehete hai, ''bijepi ko ab ehsaas ho gaya he ki sirf babasaheb hi aisi shakhsiyat hai jinaki pratimaayein desh ke har shahar, gaanv main maujuud hai jinhen logon ne apane chande se banaaya he
 While other leaders have created statues of governments
 ambedkar ek pratik nahin, vichaardhaara ban chuke hai
 "preparing to grab the legacy, the BJP wants to give a message to the Dalit vote bank by giving grandeur to all the monuments associated with Ambedkar
" dilli ke lutian jone main janpath road par modi sarkaar 192 karod ru
 Is building a grand eight-storey building, the foundation of which will be laid by PM Modi himself on April 20
 ise ambedkar international centre naam diya gaya he jisamen vigyaan bhawan kii tarah hi haul, librari aadi honge
 Apart from this, 26 Alipur Road where Ambedkar's Parinirvana (demise) took place, there was Rs 100 crore
 kii laagat se bhavy smarak banane kii taiyaari ho chuki he to landan main 1921-22 main padhai ke dauraan rahe the, us ghar ko kharidne kii prakriya centre or maharashtra kii bijepi sarkaar ne shuru kar di he
 While his birthplace was established in Mhow
 ambedkar institute ko unki jayanti ke maukey par hi madhya pradesh main state uniwarsity kaa darja diya gaya he
 While knocking on the door of Dalit, BJP is taking advantage of having a government at the center, then the Sangh has also started to improve its image
 sangh ne march main sampann hui akhil bhartiya pratinidhi sabha kii baithak main ek mandir, ek kuan or ek shmashaan kaa naaraa dekar saamaajik samarasata kii alakh jagaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Now the Sangh has decided to run a program for the Dalit
 nijee baatcheet main sangh netaaon kaa maananaa he ki abhi bhi aresas kii chhavi ucch varg ke prabhaav vaale sanghathan kii he
 The exercise to connect the Dalit society with the Sangh will be from the primary level
 sangh ne ab daliton ko sangh kii praarambhik str kii ikaayiyon mandal, basti or mohalla sangh kii cametiyon main jimmedaari dene kaa faisla kiya he
 If sources are to be believed, the Sangh has also made a strategy to organize a meal program for Dalit women with Prime Minister Modi to build trust in the society soon
 sangh ke mukhpatr paanchajnya ne ambedkar par vishesh saamagree chhaapi jiskaa locarpan bade paimaane par kiya gaya to pehali baar is mukhpatr kii teen lakh se bhi zyada pratiyaan chhaapi gayi
 Hitesh Shankar, editor of Panchjanya, says that Ambedkar is not printed on the cover of the mouthpiece for the first time, Ambedkar was also ranked on his 100th birth anniversary
 lekin is sawaal ke jawaab main ki paanchajnya ne babasaheb kii ore se hindu dharm ke virodh main die gaye vichaaron ko samahit nnyon nahin kiya, ve kehete hai, ''asprishyata ko lekar headgavar or ambedkar ke vichaar ek the
 The suffering of two mystics of the same period was similar on social issues
 sangh hameshaa todgaye kii bajaae jodgaye kii soch rakhata he, isliye paanchajnya main bhi vahi chijen chhaapi gai hai jo sakaaratmak hai
 "but he argues against publishing anti-muslim views," Babasaheb came to the Pope, the Nizam's people, but he said that if i accept Christianity or Islam, the country will be in a great danger, so i will i am choosing the path which is connected with the fundamental knowledge of this country
 '' paanchajnya ke visheshank ke locarpan main sangh ke sarkarywah bhaiyaji joshi ne sawaal uthaaya ki ambedkar se pehle madar terresa ko bharat ratna diya gaya
 He said that the question of whom Ambedkar belonged is childish
 sangh ne anushangik sanghathanon ke jariye daliton ke samuhik vivaah aayojan kii bhi yojana banaai he
 The Sangh is considered to be hostile to the issue of guarding to win trust not easy
 isaki vajah he ki jab mandal kamishan kii report lagu hui to bhagava khemaa andolan par utar aayaa tha
 The second difficult promotion is the reservation bill
 upie sarkaar ke samay jab yah bill sansad main aayaa tha to bijepi ne koi spasht rukh nahin apanaaya
 However Hitesh Shankar says that the Sangh accepted the proposal for reservation in 1989 itself
 ve kehete hai ki jab yah masalaa sangh ke chaturth sarasanghachaalak rajju bhaiya ke saamne yogyata or dakshata ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya to unhone kaha tha ki agar gunvattta ghatati he to ise bardaasht kiya ja saktaa he, lekin samaaj nahin tootna chahie
 In such a situation, there is a question whether the Modi government will pass the reservation bill in promotion soon? However, apart from these questions, the bjp-sangh Parivar currently has Dr

 The Congress alleges that the Modi government is trying to gain political advantage by publicizing the files, while Netaji's claim of being called a 'war criminal' has also raised questions

 In the fifth paragraph of the document that appeared on this side, it was clearly written that Nehru did not consider Bose a war criminal
 netaji kii maut par bane shahanvaaj kamishan se 1956 menjawahar laal nehrune kaha tha ki vah subhash chandra bose ko yuddh apradhi nahin maanate
 Whereas according to another document, the former Prime Minister in a letter to the then British PM Attlee addressed Netaji as a war criminal

 aisi filmon ko is festival se baahar hi rakhana chahie jo is shart ko puraa na karen
 During these same responses to Netflix, Cannes made the rule that the same films that would be released in theaters would participate in the festival

 Movies that go directly to streaming are "a clear and present danger to filmmakers", "once you go into a television format, you become a TV movie," if it's a good show Amy is worth an award but not an Oscar
 spilberg ne yah bhi kaha, ‘mujhe un filmon par vishwaas nahin he jinhen ek saptaah se bhi kam samay ke liye kuch cinemagharon main token yogyata di jaati he, or unhen academy puraskaar namakan ke liye arhata praapt kerani chahie

 The Congress' stance on Shivpal Yadav is not clear yet
 congress kaa ek dhada shivpal yadav ko saath rakhana chahta he jabaki doosraa dhada shivpal yadav ko lekar akhilesh yadav ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chahta kyonki chunaav ke baad ke halaat ke liye vah apane daravaaje khule rakhana chahta he
 Presently, Shivpal Yadav's Progressive Samajwadi Party seems to be falling alone amidst all these alliances and this is the reason that his anger came out in the last days when he also vented his anger on Congress at an event within the party
 unhone yahaan tak kah diya ki congress ne gathbandhan ke naam par unhen latakaae rakhaa or apni siten ghoshit kar deen
 In view of the serious efforts of the Congress alliance, the BJP has also started taking support from small but few parties in Uttar Pradesh

 "I said that i only talked to him about this
 maine unase poocha, “kya file par mere hastakshar hai?” unke paas iskaa koi jawaab nahin tha

 aaj tak se baat karte hue anna hajaare bole ki agar arvind kejariwal par kapil mishra ke dwaara lagaae gaye aarope sach sabit hote hai, to vah iske khilaaf jantar-mantar par dharna denge

 anna kaa kahana he ki kejariwal bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jang ladakar hi mukhyamantri kii kursi tak pahunche hai
 However, he said that his trust was shattered on the same day that Kejriwal's ministers were facing all kinds of serious allegations and had to resign

 sara gharelu kaamkaam mahilaayein khud kyon nipataaen?aisi sthiti saamne aane par pati-patni ko sooyeeboojh se kaam lenaa chahie
 Both should be ready to cooperate with each other

 Problems between couples who are not in the upbringing of children are further exacerbated when the question of raising young children comes up
 agar bachche ko chhodkar pati-patni, donon ko offis janaa ho, to samasya or jatil ho jaati he
 By the way, now even many small-earning 'centers' have opened in small towns, where children are claimed to be well cared for a certain number of hours

 It should be noted that the foundation of multifaceted development of the child should never be weakened

 Meanwhile, President of Wrestling Federation, Brij Bhushan Singh made it clear that wrestler Praveen Rana will be representing India in the 74 kg weight category of wrestling
 unka naminternational kushti federationako bhej diya gaya tha jiske baad unhone sweekruti de di he
 The conspiracy was not clear, and on the complaint of adulteration in Narsingh's food, Sonepat CIA team reached Sonepat Center of Sports Authority of India

 The junior wrestlers whom Narsinghne had named in his complaint were called by the police for questioning but no conspiracy has been cleared so far

 It may be that after 4 years of banpolis and NADA investigation, if Narasimha is found guilty, then he will be banned for four years on charges of parading

 The BJP leadership has been arguing that the scam happened during the UPA government and the Modi government is cleaning up the dirt left behind
 akbar ne kaha, ‘asli sawaal unase poocha janaa chahie jinhone neerav modi ke liye sho-room khole
 Akbar's statement came after Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's statement in which he accused Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi for his alleged involvement in the infamous business of Mehul Chowki

 Our country is currently standing at the crossroads of history
 ummid kii kirane paristhitiyon se ghir gai hai
 Only skilled leadership can fill the rift between despair and hope
 bharat kii vividhta ko dekhte hue iske shaskaon ko vyapak najariya rakhana hoga
 Its young population needs a bold approach to development and its more than one billion population needs stability and sustainability
 isliye sabase pehle main yah kahana chahta hum ki sawaal yah nahin he ki main kya karuunga, yaa koi bhi pradhanmantri kya karegaa
 What is important is what India needs
 yah bhale hi ek muhaavara lage lekin bharat kii chunautiyon main hi iske avasar nihit hai
 i would like to say that there are solutions to its problems as well and they will launch it in a new class
 hamen apni bahut badi khamosh aabaadi par dhyaan dena hoga jo peeche rah gai he
 Now, let us focus on our biggest problem
 aay main asamanta or garibi
 More than two-thirds of our population is dependent on the rural economy and that one-fourth of the nation is alive on income
 If we want economic growth, it is not possible without increasing the purchasing power of this silent majority population
 or iske liye sabase bada kadam he pani uplabdh karana
 Only 40 percent of the agricultural land is irrigated and 60 percent of the farmers depend on the grace of the monsoon
 hamen utpaadakta badhaane or use banaae rakhane ke liye adhik-se-adhik jameen ko pani uplabdh karana hoga
 We have to use every drop of water properly, invest in a system like dams, canals and drip irrigation system so that our farmers can get water
 vishwa bhar kii arthvyavasthaaon ke saamne anaaj kii kami kii chintaa he
 We can take our economy forward by taking advantage of global opportunities
 bharat, jisane pichley saal 18 deshon ko anaaj kii aapurti kii, duniya ke liye bhojan kii factory ban saktaa he
 This will increase rural purchasing power, strengthen the economy, promote industrialization, accelerate trade and increase the area of international trade
 duniya main koi bhi desh buniyadi dhaanche main nivesh ke bina tarakkee nahin kar sakaa he
 As i have already said, there is a solution in the problem itself
 buniyadi dhaanche main nivesh se moolbhoot udyogon main maang badhegi, rojgaar ke avasar badhenge or vruddhi bani rahegi
 The mixed effect of everyone will give a boost to development and then people will move away from agriculture to factories, which will eventually end the dependence on rural economy
 ummid he ki bharat or padosi desh china mandi kaa daur khatm karne main duniya kaa netritv karenge or is vishwaas kii vajah he yuva aabaadi
 With 50 per cent of the population below 20 years, India has a golden opportunity to create a workforce for itself and the world, but the first 10 years we need to focus on basic education, vocational education and technical education
 shiksha main nivesh se naukariyon ke avasar banenge, vikaas main teji aegi or kamaane waalon kii sankhya badhegi
 Unlike all politicians, i am not afraid of brain drain
 is samay tamaam deshon kii aabaadi budha rahi he or use yuva janashakti kii jarurat he
 India can take advantage of this opportunity, as it has both the numbers and the aptitude to work in any environment
 bhartiya logon ko har desh ke sansthaanon main chotii ke padon ko hathiyaane ke yogya bananaa chahie jaisaa ki pehle british or america logon ne kiya
 But development cannot be sustained without security
 bharat sankatagrast padosi kii bagal main basaa he
 We cannot change our geographical location, so i think it is very important to review our security preparedness
 ham bahari khatre ke liye taiyaar hai
 But India faces external and internal danger
 iske liye main dotarafa upaay apanaaungaa
 First, a complete overhaul of the internal security system
 doosraa, padosiyon ke saath dirghakaalin aadhaar par hamen bhagidaari banani hogi or sansaadhan badhaane honge
 Another major challenge before India is to completely fix the government
 iske liye sabase garib tabake kii jaruraton ko puraa karnaa hoga chaahe vah bhojan ho, makaan ho yaa rojgaar
 The government should provide source of living and health facilities to 30 crore families living below the poverty line
 vikaas kaa upar se neeche vaala ravaiya badalanaa chahie, jahaan dilli or pradesh kii rajdhaniyaan yah tay karti hai ki koun kitna paisa kharch karegaa
 This will bring a drastic change
 hamaare yahaan sarkari niyantran or sarkari dakhlandaji bahut zyada he lekin javabdehi bahut kam
 Too much control at the policy level delays and promotes corruption
 duusari taraf nijee str par seva kii gunvattta main giravat aati he
 To change this, participation of public and private sector should be increased
 shashan ke har paksh ko dekhnaa asambhav he
 So i have looked at the main issues
 apana akalan karnaa, apni jaruraton par dhyaan dena or phir samaadhaan talashna chahie
 Five years is too short for radical changes
 raashtra ke nirmaan main puraa jivan lag jaataa he
 The leader should give the right direction
 usee se 100 karod logon kii ummiden jagengi
 5 questions from Sharad Pawar what will India do to get out of the economic crisis? Answer is, investment, investment and investment to create multidimensional effect
 hamen 100 arab dollar kii gramin or shahari pariyojnaon kii suchi taiyaar kerani chahie
 This includes irrigation, electricity, roads, ports, airports and new industrial areas
 desh ko apane mahanagaron kii aabaadi ko kam karnaa hoga or main iske liye desh bhar main 50 nae shahar banane kii yojana shuru karnaa chaahunga
 What steps will you take to build confidence in national security? Internal security will be kept separate from politics
 aatankwaad ko desh kaa dushman number ek ghoshit kiya jayega, chaahe vah jis rup main ho
 At the strategic level, India's internal security system will be given equal importance as a defense system in terms of mindset and investment
 desh bhar main khufia soochna jutaney or aatankwaad virdohi ikaayiyon ke liye janashakti va praudyogiki par ek baar ke bajet kii ghoshnaa karuunga
 Justice in India is delayed and people are denied justice
 aap kya karenge?main samajhta hum ki ham is vishay par lambey samay se bahes karte rahe hai
 Malimat and other committees have already given all the advice
 sansad ke do satron ke bheetar uski kaaryayojna ban jaaegi or lagu ho jaaegi
 Special Parliamentary Committee can be consulted if required
 bhrashtachar or javabdehi kii kami se shashan kamjor hota he
 What will you do? We have too much government interference and very little accountability
 iskaa uttar sudhaar, outsorcing or praudyogiki ko badhaava dene main nihit he
 Today our plans are top to bottom and spending decisions are opaque
 achche shashan ke liye hamen logon ko shaamil karne, paardarshee vyavastha laane or jan lekha pariksha lagu karne kii jarurat he
 The criminalization of politics has become an epidemic
 ise kaise khatm karenge?iske liye hamen nirmam bananaa padegaa
 This cannot be avoided because there is growing anger among the general public
 isse loktantr se bharosa uth jayega
 We can eliminate this problem by joining with like-minded parties

 The former Air Force Chief further said that our army had targeted certain locations of Jaish (in Balakot) in the Airstrike

 The Supreme Court has not allowed Muslim girls to wear the Hijab in the All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT)

 The court rejected the petition, saying that in 3 hours your faith will not be lessened by your religion
 court ne yah bhi kaha ki agar is tarah ke chote-chote mudde uthte rahe to exam karana mushkil ho jayega
 Let us tell you that earlier the Kerala High Court had allowed two Muslim girls to wear hijab in the All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT) to be held on 25 July
 court ne central board of secondary ajukeshan (sibiesai ) ko aadesh diya he ki board do muslim ladakiyon ko hijaab or puri aasteen ke kapaden pahanane kii anumati de
 It was argued on behalf of these girls of Kerala that it is necessary to wear this according to their religious customs

 tipu se uttar pradesh ke 'sultan' ban chuke akhilesh yadav kaa janm 1 july, 1973 ko itawa ke saifai main hua or is tarah se jidangi ke 46 saal kaa safar unhone aaj tay kar liya he
 Maintaining the political legacy of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav became an MP at the age of 27 and in 38 years, made history by becoming the youngest Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state
 haalanki pita kii siyaasi viraasat ko akhilesh lagaataar khote ja rahe hai
 This is the reason why the SP is going through the most difficult phase of its history, so the question is whether Akhilesh will be able to bring the party back again? Growing up in a political atmosphere, Akhilesh won the Kannauj Lok Sabha by-election in 2000 for a political shift
 Started unhone apane nikatatam pratidwandi basapa ke akbar ahamed dampi ko kareeb 58 hajaar voton se haraaya
 After this, Akhilesh won this seat continuously in 2004 and 2009, but in 2009, apart from Kannauj, he also won from Firozabad parliamentary seat
 iske baad unhone firozabad sansadeey seat se istipha de diya he
 In 2012, UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav traveled all over the state in the 2012 Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections
 iskaa nateeja tha ki sapa ne purna bahumat ke saath satta main vaapasi kii
 After which Mulayam Singh Yadav took a big decision and decided to make Akhilesh Yadav the Chief Minister
 is tarah mahaj 38 saal kii umr main akhilesh upi ke 33wein mukhyamantri bane
 He has the record of becoming the youngest Chief Minister in the state
 haalanki isi ke baad se sapa kaa graph doun hota chalaa gaya
 While Chief Minister, Akhilesh Yadav started plans to run metro projects in UP, infrastructure-based projects like lucknow-agra Expressway, as well as laptops to youth and pension to poor women
 unhone 'four len road' ke saath-saath purvanchal express ve pariyojna kii neenv rakhi, lekin sarkaar chali jane se puraa nahin ho sakaa
 Failing political challenges, Akhilesh Akhilesh Yadav also describes himself as a farmer, engineer, environmentalist and social worker along with the socialist leader of the country
 sapa kii kaman jab se akhilesh yadav ko mili he, party ko lagaataar haar kaa munh dekhnaa pad rahaa he
 All the political experiments Akhilesh has done, all have failed
 sapa ko sabase pehle karaari haar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mili
 All SP veterans lost in Modi wave
 mahaj 'mulaayam kunbe' ke sadsy ko chhodkar koi or nahin jeet sakaa tha
 The SP got just five seats
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav se ain pehle mulaayam raajnneetik viraasat ko lekar shivpal yadav or akhilesh yadav ke bich varchasv kii jang hui
 In this, Akhilesh prevailed over everyone and took command of the party in his hands
 iske baad akhilesh yadav congress ke saath gathbandhan kar chunavi maidan main utre, lekin yah prayog safal nahin ho sakaa or sapa ko karaari haar mili
 The SP got just 46 seats
 iske baad akhilesh yadav ne 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mulaayam kii marji ke bina hi mayawati kii party basapa se gathbandhan kaa faisla kar liya
 Akhilesh Yadav held joint rallies with Mayawati across the state, but he could not win SP even in this experiment
 sapa ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa or party ko mahaj paanch siten mili
 Not only this, Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav has to face defeat in Kannauj, brother Dharmendra Yadav in Badayun and Akshay Yadav in Firozabad
 is haar ne akhilesh yadav or unki party donon ko andar tak hilaakar rakh diya he
 On the other hand, Mayawati broke alliances by blaming the loss of Akhilesh Yadav and his vote bank Yadav community
 sapa apane raajnneetik itihaas main sabase bure daur se guzar rahi he
 There have been signs of major changes in the SP since the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, but there has been no change in the organization so far with Akhilesh Yadav being abroad
 aise main sawaal he ki akhilesh yadav sapa kii vaapasi kaise kara paaenge?for latest update on mobile SMS < news > to 52424 for Airtel, Vodafone and idea users

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par lage bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko lekar aam aadmi party ne pradarshan shuru kar diya he
 Aam Aadmi Party workers demonstrated outside the house of BJP state president and MP Manoj Tiwari on Wednesday
 kaaryakartaaon kaa kahana he ki manoj tiwari aaropon ko siddh karen, nahin to maafee maangen
 Significantly, Manoj Tiwari accused the Aam Aadmi Party government of Delhi and said that the Kejriwal government has scammed Rs 2000 crore in the name of education
 tiwari ne manish sisodiya par bada aarope madha tha kaha tha ki or ab manish sisodiya ko turant istipha dena chahie
 Tiwari said that the government says that it has done a big job in education but has done a scam of 2000 crores in the name of education
 udhar dilli ke up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne ravivaar ko bijepi ke kaaryakari adhyaksh je
 P
 nadda ko bijepi ke shiksha model ke tahat chal rahe das sarkari skulon kii tulana kejariwal sarkaar ke skulon se karne kii chunauti di
 Sisodia said, "I challenge Nadda to compare ten government schools working under the BJP education model with Kejriwal's education model
 "unka yah bayaan nadda ke is bayaan ke ek din baad aayaa he ki dilli main sattarudh aam aadmi party (aap) hansi kaa paatr ban kar rah gai he
 Sisodia said, "nadda said that you have become a character of laughter
 bijepi kaa yah kaaryakari adhyaksh ek tarah se dilli ke logon kii khilli uda rahaa he
 He is saying that the people of Delhi deserve laughter
 " sisodiya ne yaad dilaayaa ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne loksabhaa main kaha tha ki nirvaachit sarkaron kaa majaak udaana desh or janadesh kaa majaak udaana he
 He said, "looks like Nadda's view is different from the Prime Minister's
 " Date: 25-06-2013 i received a letter written by Smt
 Sheela Dixit, your political secretary, Mr
 Pawan Kheda
 isamen aapane kuch mudde uthaae hai jinke jawaab main is patr ke madhyam se de rahaa hum, lekin main asamanjas main hum ki aapane yah chitthee mujhe sidhe hi kyon nahin likh di, apane staff ke naam se kyon likhi? abhi kuch maheenon pehle bhi aapane aisa hi kiya tha
 In a public meeting i said that you are doing brokerage for power companies
 aap ko shaayad wo bura laga
 Even then, instead of filing a defamation case against me directly, i had made a case against me in the name of Mr
 Pawan Kheda Ji
 angreji main ek kahawat he- 
 a leader should lead from the front
 kisi ke peeche chhupakar kaam karnaa yaa kisi or ke kandhe par bandook rakhkar chalaanaa ek netaa kii kamajori darshata he
 You have written in your letter that till now the politics of Delhi was very clean and i messed it up
 aisa aapako isliye lag rahaa he kyonki ab tak dilli main aapkaa virodh karne vaala koi nahin tha
 There was no opposition party in Delhi
 bhaajapa or congress ke bich main match pioxing thi
 The politics of Delhi was made a common business by the BJP and the Congress
 bhaajapa or congress donon bijli or pani companiyon se mili hue hai
 AAP kept increasing the prices of electricity and water and the BJP kept pretending to perform on the road for an hour or a day at a time
 janata lut rahi thi, pis rahi thi, karaah rahi thi
 But everything was going well for both of you parties
 donon partiyaan khush thim
 Now suddenly the Aam Aadmi Party came and spread the opinion of both the parties
 idhar aap dukhi hai, aap kah rahi hai ki hamane dilli kii raajnneeti gandi kar di
 The BJP is unhappy there
 wo bhi kah rahi he ki hamane dilli kii raajnneeti gandi kar di
 But the common man of Delhi has become very happy
 dilli ke aam aadmi ko pehali baar ek eemaandaar vikalp mila he
 If you really want to do 'clean politics' then you should take the following steps immediately - 1
 aaj dilli vidhansabha main congress ke 16 aise vidhayak hai jinke upar sangeen aparaadh ke mukademen chal rahe hai
 How can such people sit in the assembly and enact laws against rape, murder and corruption? The Legislative Assembly is a temple
 aise logon kii to maujuudagi se hi yah mandir apavitra ho jaataa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has announced that no person of any criminal image will be given a ticket in the upcoming assembly elections
 agar aap vaaki dilli kii raajnneeti ko svachh bananaa chaahati hai to aap ko elaan karnaa chahie ki congress bhi aane vaale chunaavon main kisi bhi aapraadhik chhavi vaale vyakti ko tikat nahin degi
 2
 raajnneetik partiyon ko milane vaala chanda paardarshee hona chahie
 The Aam Aadmi Party puts all its donors list on the website
 khabaron ke mutabik congress party ko pichley paanch varshon main do hajaar karod rupayon se bhi zyada kaa chanda mila
 But the Congress party is not giving the list of donors
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki koyala ghotaale main shaamil kai companiyon ne bhi congress ko chanda diya he
 But it will be known only when you make this list public
 agar aap yah list website par daal den to logon ke man main vishwaas paidaa hoga ki aap vaaki ‘svachh raajnneeti’ karnaa chaahati hai
 3
 aaj hamaare desh kii raajnneeti ko vanshavaad ne grasit kiya hua he
 Many people from the same family get tickets
 aam aadmi party ne elaan kiya he ki wo ek parivaar se do logon ko tikat nahin degi
 i request you that if you really want 'clean politics' then you should declare that the Congress party will not give tickets to more than one person from the same family
 mujhe maaloom he ki yadi aap aisa elaan karti hai to aapako bahut badi qurbaani deni hogi- yaa to aapako yaa aapke suputr shri sandip dikshit ji ko, donon main se ek vyakti ko raajnneeti se sanyaas lenaa hoga
 If you take the above three steps, then people will believe that you really want to do 'clean politics'
 aapane apane patr main likhaa he ki hamane apane auto campagne main aapako apshabd kahen hai
 i do not belive it
 aap khud hi bataaie ki maine aisa koun sa shabd kaha jo aapako thik nahin laga? main yah baat jarur maanata hum ki maine kai jagah yah kaha he ki aap bijli companiyon kii dallali kar rahi hai
 But did i say wrong? Because you have increased the price of electricity in Delhi
 isse tata or ambani kii bijli companiyon ko baari munafa ho rahaa he, lekin unako paise kii havas itani zyada he ki itnaa baari munafa hone ke baavjood unhone apane khaaton main gadabadi karke 20,000 karod rupee kaa ghaataa dikhaa diya
 The question arises that if there is such a huge loss, why did Tata and Ambani not stop this business? You would believe that Tata and Ambani have not come to Delhi to do social service, they have come to earn money
 kya aaj tak ambani bandhuon ne apni jindagi main ek bhi ghate kaa sauda kiya he? dilli airport metro line main jaise hi ghaataa hona shuru hua, ambani wo bijness chhodkar bhaag gaye
 Then why is he standing here despite a loss of 20,000 crores? Something is wrong dilli kii sari janata kah rahi he ki in companiyon kaa audit karaao
 But without conducting an audit, you are increasing the price of electricity again and again
 aap kaa kahana he ki aap to audit karaane ko taiyaar hai, lekin ye bijli companiyaan nahin maan rahi
 You do not embrace this argument
 mukhyamantri aap hai yaa bijli companiyaan? aakhir hamaari mukhyamantri bijli companiyon ke saamne bebas or laachaar kyon hai? agar bijli companiyaan audit karaane ko taiyaar nahin to aap unka license kyon nahin radd kar detii? yahaan aakar janata ke man main prashn uthta he ki kya shila dikshit ji bijli companiyon kii dallali kar rahi hai? jaise hi bijli companiyon ne kaha ki unhen 20,000 karod kaa ghaataa ho gaya to aap turant daudi-daudi centre sarkaar ke paas jaati hai or anil ambani ko bachaane ke liye centre se vittiya package maangati hai
 But when the people of Delhi are moaning due to increased electricity bills, you say stop using coolers, T
 ve
 Stop using, stop using fridge
 aapke inhen kathanon or karmon kii vajah se logon ko vishwaas ho gaya he ki aapaki bijli companiyon se santh-ganth he
 More than half of the people of Delhi do not have water in their homes
 pichley 15 saal se aap mukhyamantri hai
 You have not been able to reach your homes in 15 years
 iske baavjood aapaki sarkaar dilli main karodo rupee kharch karke ishtahaar laga rahi he
 And claims to be development in Delhi
 kaisaa vikaas? kiskaa vikaas? in ishtaharon par kharch kiye gaye karodon rupee yadi pani par kharch kiye gaye hote to shaayad kuch gharon ke logon tak pani pahunch jaataa
 You are the legislature of the New Delhi Legislative Assembly, where the Prime Minister, the President, all ministers etc
 live
 sabase badi bidambana yah he ki aapaki apni vidhansabha main logon ke gharon main pani nahin aa rahaa
 There is a DIZ area in your assembly
 yah raashtrapati bhawan se maatra 3 ki
 M
 kii duuri par he
 Here too people do not have drinking water in their homes
 yahaan ke log park se pine kaa pani lekar aate hai
 Everyday, people line up in the parks to fill water and people carry buckets all the way to the fourth floor
 aadhi se zyada dilli kii yahi kahani he
 Like in olden days women used to bring water from the well
